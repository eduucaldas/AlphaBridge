nt|xenya: and Hans|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South will be disappointed, when he sees dummy in 4 @h|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h on EW is makeable, but a careful play is needed|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|shevek: hi Sunil, Geoff|pg||
mb|1N|nt|peachy: The Youth tem is well placed in the current running score|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: NEC Bridge Festifal|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello everyone and welcome back |pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs play 1N=15-17,  Klinger-Mullamphy transfer over their 3+ 1@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: likely to get there if W bids|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all and welcome to this second of four 16-board segments of the 15th NEC Cup Final.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what opening bid from E? 4@h or is he too strong?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes this should be an exciting end to the event|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the question I have is it really poiish club,  I think it has been modified substantially by them|pg||
nt|sybarra: and then, they are both agressive and of course play the hands well....|pg||
nt|hlortz: typical modern bridge all 3 players have bid in front of west who has a decent opening hand:)|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|chick: probably play in a NT partscore somewhere|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Morning from DK - and doÂ´nt get surprised, if E/W will start with 420 - og maybe 450, depending on the lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello - He will sure risk 2 @S|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S down 1?|pg||
nt|sybarra: however n/s do not play at speed of light (until the end of hand) |pg||

nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello - letÂ´s start with 1 NT undoubled?|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: Hi Geof and Nicoleta|pg||
nt|shevek: a well fought final, only 10 imps difference with 16 boards to go|pg||
nt|roswolf: majors i assume|pg||
mb|d|nt|peachy: The tournament website for those interested, scores from Match 5 are not yet there but will sonn I'm sure http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyone for X instead of 1@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: misfit perhaps but very close to 3N|pg||
nt|chick: or 2@C :)|pg||
nt|peachy: or 3|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|peachy: from NEC Bridge Festival in Yokohama, Japan|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Yokohama in Japan for the 15th NEC Cup. 12 rounds of qualifying (Swiss), 14 boards per match. This is a match from round 7 |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello V|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Apteker-Gower are the "South" part of Team South Sweden -- they're from South Africa|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the heavy promotion of the N hand will likely allow 3N to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have a CC that says NS play Precision with variable NT [sometimes 10-12, other 14-16]|pg||
nt|sybarra: Ish is quite interesting |pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I guess 3@H is OK, but 3NTis possible too I suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Hans and Vladimir. Hi to kibs.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and now?|pg||
nt|peachy: esciting hand, afteralll|pg||
nt|peachy: This is the current leaders versus  2|pg||
nt|xenya: hi Ralf|pg||
mb|r|nt|peachy: i would certainly raise clubs as S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N by N would make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=Puppet Stayman|pg||
nt|sybarra: they found the @S lead in the other room |pg||
nt|marlowepi: case for Slead but H normal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it's a WBF card from 2008 - so maybe they played for Bulgaria in Beijing|pg||
nt|sybarra: Ish =Del Monte|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even playing walsh style, a passed hand can afford to bid 1D, surely|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: oh well, cant spell|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Raija Davis, Hans Werge and Jim Gordon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the ecats site has a CC for the Italians from the 2009 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I believe Bach's nickname is "ash"|pg||
mb|2S|nt|chick: 3N doesn't look very makeable to me, but I'm sure you're right :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The 3rd @D might bring some problemes|pg||
nt|xenya: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings -- not updated for Round 7 yet |pg||
nt|hawe45:  No losing option in slam, I think|pg||
mb|3C|nt|hlortz: well called peter|pg||
nt|flash: welcome (back), all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings after 6 rounds|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @H should make because of the @c discard on the @S Queen|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and with this lead...|pg||
nt|shevek: here we are, hello everyone, the last round of the swiss|pg||
nt|sybarra2: well it works|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I personally prefer3@H , I hate to treat stiff A as a stopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Conservative view by Sally Brock here opposite 15-17, but it often pays off at matchpoints|pg||
nt|marlowepi: natural diamond lead from E, two rounds of clubs, over fast|pg||
nt|peachy: 5C happens to make also, right?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: y|pg||
nt|peachy: W got worried and pulled|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Difficult to find the best lead: @C Ace|pg||
nt|po-s: anyone knows the standings?|pg||
nt|shevek: you're picking Hans :)|pg||
nt|larrymori: yeah i met him in Yokohama|pg||
nt|sybarra: shortly for Ashley   thx Nick |pg||
nt|larrymori: first|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The other semifinal is over I am told. Bulgaria has conceded against Zimmermann|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but after the non-rasie by South, partner figures tohave at least a half stop|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so I'd be sympathetic to 3NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you can't say the cards are well placed though|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: in trick 2: @C and S has to take 3 tricks in minor|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the@D suit is a nightmare|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: a bit harsh to attribute a result to a normal lead?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W helped a bit - now declarer should guess @s correctly|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the redouble indicating that he is playable in @D too ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: XX, means @S longer than @H a spec tells me|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: very good auction|pg||
nt|shevek: current results will be updated soon at: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec_bul.html|pg||
nt|shevek: another spec suggests west is too weak to o/call 1NT|pg||
nt|shevek: the formula is (nr of cards in 2 suits) - (number of losers)>=2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: N appreciates his primey hand|pg||
nt|peachy: found the best place|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West endplayed|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - otherwise his partner was|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S back is best|pg||
nt|xenya: a somewhat light and risky double by N on just 2 aces|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - anf opener third in hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: -50 could win a few vs. 140|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N getting what he maybe deserved. even so, maybe S should pass 2D...he has probably already shown spade tolerance by passing 1S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK - 920 in sight|pg||
nt|shevek: 9-7=2 in this case|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: par contract i suppose at teh end of it all|pg||
pc|s9|nt|chick: pretty amazing lead :)|pg||
nt|peachy: tricky lead...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: logical lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N marked with heart shortness|pg||
nt|peachy: heart indicated by auction, so what can he do, ignore logic, but it is still ricky...|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S 10 was an option|pg||
nt|flash: the trump split will slow declarer down a bit|pg||
nt|xenya: creates a small problem for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  udca|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But no big risk to double 180 instead of 90|pg||
nt|po-s: 3NT?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: ruffing with the 9 seems to be correct|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s not the way everybody would play. Ruff with the Jack og King and play against the Queen. But no argument against success|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you could cash @H A, lead a @D to the K and play a @C to the 7 = South won't enjoy being n lead, but it's all a bit DD|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|peachy: tricky :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes  gutsy move |pg||
nt|peachy: NS play Polish Club, EW 5card major and 15-17NT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ralfwil: If S wins with @sA and continues with @c I think Fantoni will play @dK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi everyone|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|flash: declarer will probably start on one of the pointed suits|pg||
nt|hawe45:  His problem is, that @S King might be by the 1 @D-bidder |pg||
nt|peachy: declarer is weighing his options|pg||
nt|flash: mentally going through each possible line - trying to find the safest/ most reasonable|pg||
nt|flash: all not lost if the @SK off-side|pg||
nt|peachy: against this opposition, it pays to be careful|pg||
nt|flash: that looks like the most probable choice from here|pg||
nt|flash: declarer has a rather strong clue to the location of the @DA...|pg||
nt|xenya: this rates to make |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Awful @H-shift, partner wanted @S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in a sense "W helped", but if he hadnt bid N would be playing a level lower|pg||
pc|c5|nt|po-s: soon is not soon enough...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: And there is no game in spades, what about notrumps?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and no more trumps |pg||
nt|chick: certainly solves the problem of the diamond loser, so it was a no-risk finesse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she just has to decide which red suit to finesse. heart hook also logiocal--if E had D card but no heart card, probably a D lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html       tourney site|pg||
nt|peachy: i think best the diamonds before getting to board with S ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well if there are 2 trump losers and D queen is on but heart king off, it is not no risk--it goes down in a makeable contract|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: Low-High from N sh be even No|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some interesting decisions at several stages of the auction here.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: udca=Upside Down  Count  Attitude|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Marshall|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Raija.|pg||
nt|peachy: Jordan:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hello raija, jordan, rehi Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores thru 8 matches posted at  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Marshall.|pg||
nt|peachy: Al:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i think this is match  10|pg||
nt|jcwla: Either N or E might have made a double at their turn.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i can see 3C with the N hand, but double looks dangerous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C in context of Precision probably shows longer @C|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|xenya: onthis defence, it's cold|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what about 6nt? if @c are Jxxx - x, @hq can be on side|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes sure|pg||
nt|po-s: hej Ralf, hi all|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: and actually -- a number of big clubbers use  1@D-2@H as Reverse Flannery - to show the 5@S 4@H weak responding hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I normally guess one board right per day - here it was|pg||
nt|xenya: the other room was quicker -- a push|pg||
nt|po-s: 6nt?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is good play|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|hawe45:  @S-return kept West in 420 |pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H to the Ace is working very well now|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North will likely put dummy back in|pg||
nt|hlortz: even if e transfers and bids 2n, w likely to pass with 15 and no @S fit|pg||
nt|flash: declarer's problem, if the @SK is, indeed, offside is the lack of an entry to hand|pg||
nt|peachy: Both of these teams are prime candidates for winning the whole event|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  not sure why W covered the ten of clubs as trick one|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: Right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, it's a very good 15 count with a strong 5-card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some may accept the invite|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Should we say it this way - @S-shift was not killing|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'm with W in a sense of his bidding, actually, but this time his activity wasted |pg||
nt|po-s: just in case North holds Jxxx in clubs - and the HQ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Yokohama. hi to all|pg||
nt|flash: Sementa had few options, but that certainly clarified/simplified things for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: argument for @S is that partner has all the points -- even if @H strikes strength -- may not be entry to East's length|pg||
nt|shevek: you're peeking PO :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|peachy: now should go down, he doesnt have the ricks any more|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|shevek: A few words about the format of the event:|pg||
nt|po-s: yes, and questioning what par is|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: he lead 9, so....N had to count (3) |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: oh you mean N  sorry |pg||
nt|xenya: 1N went down next door, so it will be not 3 imps, but 6|pg||
nt|shevek: 48 teams entered, random draw for the 1st match, then swiss draw|pg||
nt|po-s: but will lose against 4s-D|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello po :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi p-o|pg||
nt|po-s: Hi Mike!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: always up so late :)|pg||
nt|larrymori: hi PO|pg||
pc|h8|nt|peachy: Netherlands, with a strong young team, is also among the favorites|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|peachy: can no lnger make|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|hawe45:  In a while, dummy has two tricks but no entry|pg||
nt|shevek: a 12-round swiss of 14-board matches to qualify 8 teams to the KO phase|pg||
pc|s2|nt|po-s: funny, HK lead beats it I think|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|flash: declarer's home now - on virtually any line where he doesn't revoke|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would pass as W. you have no game facing a PH, and probably NS can outbid you. meanwhile, maybe they have made a mistake|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is not as if you rate to beat what they bid at the 2 level either|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: and if you do, they are still NV|pg||
nt|marlowepi: still, no doubt it might be right to bid|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Jordan, hi kibitzers|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Raija.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chick: this is not going well at all for the declarer|pg||
nt|peachy: was making when he was in dummy|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: the idea of ruffing losers ought to have occurred to declarer sooner than it did|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|othered1: On the other hand, you may beat 3N off the top if partner has @HAKxxx, but not @SAKxxx|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|shevek: NS will lose 1imp here|pg||
nt|po-s: 22 in  clubs or 31 plus diamond finesse unless 5card heart should have an entru|pg||

nt|peachy: Hello David|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Must be a flat board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- played the 2@H bidder to hold ZERO @H honors|pg||
nt|jcwla: A couple of Roland choices here.|pg||
nt|shevek: and remember, every imp counts in this set|pg||
nt|roswolf: has gained an imp|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|shevek: sry, EW I meant|pg||
nt|roswolf: well a 50/50 slam|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: is 6@H par on this ?|pg||

nt|roswolf: close:)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hawe45:  Here 3 NT better be played by South|pg||
nt|marlowepi: true. the case for a spade is that if you are beating this with hearts your heart ten is redundant, whereas if spades is the right suit the heart ten may be of some use on defense|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like an easy 4@s|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+  |pg||
mb|2H|nt|hawe45:  Hello PEO|pg||
nt|po-s: is there a link to standings?|pg||
nt|xenya: hello PO|pg||
nt|larrymori: slam happens to be cold but...|pg||
nt|shevek: 1st board of this set, 23 hcp 3NT and 10 imps for Lavazza|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@C for the majors. She has her bid :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I think, we should recommand a part score here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It seems here, that 4 @H depends on the @C-suit|pg||
nt|flash: Polish Club - several possible hands|pg||
nt|flash: in this case, the strong(est) option|pg||
nt|marlowepi: predict 3S final contract|pg||
nt|po-s: rules are different in Australia - but yes 6H is par|pg||
nt|roswolf: no free ride for e/w in the other room|pg||
mb|2N!|an|S|nt|xenya: but this might not be flat -- particularly after the double by W|pg||
nt|hawe45:  EastÂ´s double is OK - for the minors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ecats should still have convention cards for both pairs online from Beijing 2008 |pg||
nt|marlowepi: friendly hand, endplayed into making 6N|pg||
nt|othered1: well odds-off|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@s = Xfer to @cs|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w unlikely to risk the slam imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3-loser hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another possible slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: correct play makes it|pg||
nt|xenya: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may go all pass|pg||
nt|pelu: overcals in minor vuln sh normal be on 6 card suits - so S passed where mane clubplayers would bid 2@C|pg||
nt|othered1: I like west's pass.  But I've seen lots of strange 1N overcalls on hands like that, too.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: nothing to write home about in this hand |pg||
nt|tejjyid: me too, on both counts|pg||
mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: even on best lead of D ace|pg||
nt|hlortz: for sure vul too dangerous to overcall at IMPs|pg||
nt|sybarra: does N take any action now? |pg||
nt|sybarra: i.e., is it worth is?|pg||
nt|peachy: strongest is 19+ any shape|pg||
nt|flash: our operator threw up a small false card|pg||
nt|flash: didn't slow us down, however   :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @H RD is a make|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: may be forced to play correctly no entry to dummy |pg||
nt|marlowepi: D king|pg||
nt|pelu: will Balicki bid 2@H? - he know that the @s's are bad for him max doubleton in West|pg||
nt|xenya: Oz Players are currently 4th, 16 VPS ahead of Sara who are 6/7th |pg||
nt|po-s: or rather 6 diamonds doubled|pg||
nt|roswolf: without a diamond bid from n/s very hard to imagine the perfect fit|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hawe45:  SouthÂ´s 2 @S must be a minimum-hand...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = ART Game Force [2-way Checkback]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't know why Sementa didn't bid 2@H :(|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Here a pass from West would be a big win!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nice West-hand - E/W can make 1 @S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless EW play 4-card majors, E would probably have bid 2S over 1S if his pd had opened in first seat|pg||
nt|po-s: how much is that?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Very risky, but more than 620|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and without a @h lead 9 tricks in 2@hRD|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oays even better then|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Pays|pg||
nt|po-s: really?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But East was right, without @H-lead 11 tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  po-s even 2 @H D is more than 620 (670)|pg||
nt|shevek: if east is thinking, he would have done better to bid 5@d (exclusion) 1st time|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in clubs dummy has about 6 entries|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But only a @S-lead is good for the defense|pg||
nt|po-s: wkNT with lots of shapes..|pg||
mb|5C|nt|peachy: oops|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry I was talking about 2 @S |pg||
nt|shevek: they probably will :)|pg||
nt|po-s: I heard you the first time - or rather saw you|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well this will be a nice result |pg||
nt|hawe45:  In the good old days, South would have doubled|pg||
mb|d|nt|jbgood: i'd rather double 2@c than 4 @h|pg||
nt|pelu: and prob @Ss bad for declayer - act 2@H down 1 - EW tahe the first 6 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i freely open 1N with a 5-card major, but here i would open 1S. i doubt we have a game if pd responds 1N, and if pd is 35 in majors we will play wrong suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: either 2C was Puyppet or E is already steaming trying to get the swing back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: current standings available at  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1100 against 2 @H D - and against any other contract I suppose|pg||
nt|xenya: the teams' primary target is to get to the quarter-finals|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: NS do quite well in diamonds, but the club break is awkward|pg||
nt|hlortz: dubion must be worth another try here...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Henry.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he may not try. he may just bid it|pg||
nt|peachy: maybe 2NT has dual meaning|pg||
nt|hlortz: duboin ..my typing is lacking|pg||
nt|jcwla: 10 IMPs to Bulgaria on 1 - Lavazza got to 5@D and that was doubled and set 3.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1 = 17|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not that much point in trying when YOU have eight controls. partner is likely to drop you even when you want to be there|pg||
nt|peachy: even a player with no pulse would get that dbld, I think,|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@d looks like an overbid... whatever it means|pg||
nt|marlowepi: either EW play 4-card majors or E was allowing for possible 4-card suit by doubling. still, with short spades a 43 fit could be the best spot, with the ruff coming in the short ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trump hand|pg||
nt|shevek: 5@c will go down|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I hate bidding NT on that hand - sometimes your fixed; if this is the hand, no need to lose sleep over it.|pg||
nt|roswolf: might bid the slam now|pg||
nt|po-s: stepping stone to show CA|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: he must win and return a trump|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best defense @C Ace and a trump|pg||
nt|po-s: 2D obviously showed hearts - transfer advance|pg||
nt|ritong: hello everybody|pg||
nt|ppiglett: ta|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Lucky with @c109 on N|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Double-dummy 10 "easy" tricks|pg||
mb|5D|nt|hawe45:  And defense can have some fun against 4 @S, when they play the 13th @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not updated after round 3 yet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow, what do they open?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and NO 8+ fit|pg||
nt|po-s: no?|pg||
nt|roswolf: last train?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: never said it was easy to get to slam:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: think e will make exactly 2@D|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 losers  and no problem with ruffing @Ss|pg||
nt|xenya: hard to see where E found the 5@C bid|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East trusted South - a mistake|pg||
nt|ralfwil: why 5@c now?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tough decision atr trick one, probably wrong|pg||
nt|othered1: so ifyou changed @H and @D in west's hand, you would open 1N, Marshall?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: y|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree|pg||
nt|jcwla: Whoa, this is hard to believe.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  After 3 @D, North must be short in @C, so only one winning solution - @C  Jack!|pg||
mb|5H|nt|hlortz: the 4-0 trump break will beat this i think|pg||
nt|hlortz: notice ns lead low from xx unlike most [non polish] pairs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N was max of 14  presumably  2N or 3N said not great hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trump lead would probably hold this to 2, but hard to fault the club lead:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Good evening to David Greenwood|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@S on J-fourth and @H Kx might not be everyone's choice -- 3@H looking like a mixed raise -- and not everyone would move w/E's hand either.|pg||
nt|peachy: knowledgeable spec pointed out how good a bid 4D was|pg||
nt|peachy: in the meantime, declarer is on track to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Hello people|pg||
nt|peachy: despite bad trump breakm, declarer still makes|pg||
nt|jcwla: "I'll always believe you should have made it, partner."|pg||
nt|shevek: flat board|pg||
nt|tejjyid: hi enri|pg||
nt|po-s: I guess that would consistent with CK and DA?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|peachy: 1H was 4+ 7+HCP, a diamond canape possibility|pg||
nt|roswolf: true p-o - perhaps west should xx 5@C?|pg||
nt|po-s: no last train - RD would have been my choice|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jbgood: an unlucky downer (2?)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, with @hs 4-0 and North with a doubleton @s This wont be nice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can consider yourself very unlucky to go two down opposite four trumps|pg||
nt|hlortz: s taps the dummy to shut out the long spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: From Brock's point of view I mean|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session1.htm  for standings after session 1|pg||
nt|jtr: Pointed out that 4@h is unlikely to be doubled at many tables|pg||
nt|jtr: Unusual opening by North|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Session 2 results and standings: http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session2.htm scoretables|pg||
nt|jtr: Did 2@s really make 9 on board 23?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East should continue trump!|pg||
nt|pelu: also almost standard in denmark|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer another X|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dburn: instead, Beauty picked up 5 IMPs for missing game when the Latin played in a weird 4-2 spade fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once hearts break there is a perfect elimination for 6, winning even if KTx or KJx of Ds are offside|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Henri!|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|hlortz: ah i see not common in USA|pg||
nt|flash: headed for 11 tricks?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hawe45:  You have almost an opening bid - and your partner doubles 1 @S - should they have 790, then OK|pg||
nt|ritong: other room plays higher|pg||
nt|ritong: in @ds|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hello all|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcwla: Well in the OR Fantoni matched the 3@S but Sementa did not move and 3@S/N the spot.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: hello|pg||
pc|s4|nt|po-s: South should have cashed the HA if he had had it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  AActually South should have played the @D King maybe|pg||
nt|po-s: but club is no good since declarer can ruff high and throw a dia|pg||
nt|hawe45:  10 I think|pg||
nt|peachy: let me ask our BFF (best friend forever) GIB...|pg||
nt|flash: @D honor now keeps 11 in play|pg||
nt|peachy: he says 11 or 12|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S needed to switch, but W needed to win first trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my fault - was chatting -- 2@C WAS 5-Card Stayman  and the pair defines using it with 53 majors -- transfer then 2/3 NT = 52|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even opposite this dog 6N has fair play: Qx   KTx   Kxx  QJTxx|pg||
nt|xenya: and 2 last qualifying rounds will be played today, including this one|pg||
nt|xenya: so this match is quite important for Sara|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good morning all|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Well both pairs missed the par slam :)|pg||
mc|12|nt|hawe45:  OK - I made a new count|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a worthwhile investment|pg||
nt|roswolf: a push|pg||
nt|po-s: anyway, regarding slam - it may well be below 50% but that has nothing to do with par|pg||
pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|brgpro: say 4@d -X|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: This one they will reach|pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|nt|jtr: Hmmmm|pg||
nt|cuttysark: What - 1NT?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They should make "control-Z" work in BBO|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If your partner opened 1NT and you held that South hand, would you move?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It's all down there in black and grey - no going back :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: I wouldn't with 433333333333, NV|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Actually, Nunes knew just a bit more - his partner won't have 4 hearts|pg||

nt|jtr: That would be beyond her|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|brgpro: i want to go to her school dav|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Only a 1imp loss for the missed game on 49|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bjacobs: gained in fact|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: We are really in for a treat. 4 of the world's best pairs in this match, and if that's not good enough for you, then go watch Grøtheim-Tundal, another great pair|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sorry - they gained an imp. (Must try to keep up)|pg||

nt|po-s: correct Hans, glad youré awake!|pg||
nt|loganrun: what is your opening here?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes with pard having club ace |pg||
nt|sybarra: more fun!|pg||
nt|larrymori: didnt need the @ss 33 but being able to cover the low spot in @d made it cold|pg||
nt|sybarra: where do YOU want to be on this hand |pg||
nt|po-s: oh please, KJ doubleton in D on side would also do it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: curious that when N led a heart and E won, E continued that suit. |pg||
nt|shevek: hi victor|pg||
nt|tejjyid: major, but not new|pg||
nt|peachy: probable 3NT now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East|pg||
nt|po-s: yes last|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: we see here the strong part of 1@C |pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S after a (strong) 1C from S|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  -200 -I doÂ´nt know why|pg||
nt|flash: i have a hard time with only 9, though...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That happens|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hi Nic|pg||
nt|jcwla: Lots of points but two pesky little cards in the opps' hands.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ralfwil: 5@c on EW. can they find it?|pg||
nt|po-s: let us see if N-S can stop in 2S|pg||
nt|shevek: 1@s|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Too late po|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Good old Irving Gordon, originally from Scotland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I bet David played against him a few times|pg||
nt|jtr: And in teams with him|pg||
nt|marlowepi: awfully good hand for a weak 2, if that is what it is|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  red suits lie well for NS - for 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: anyway well done by both sides as 4@H was cold|pg||
nt|hlortz: usual 1@C is like a weakNT|pg||
nt|dburn: strong club, weak no trump in use for North-South|pg||
nt|peachy: 11-18, 5c S|pg||
nt|flash: we had a famous baseball player in the old days "Shoeless" Joe Jackson...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their convention card from Sao Paolo just says "2-way checkback"|pg||
nt|sybarra: true po,  but how to get there?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it was not as bad a slam as many we see, though odds-against|pg||
nt|larrymori: south would have to put up the 10 to cause a problem|pg||
nt|othered1: and 1N is?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has some chances in 4S|pg||
nt|peachy: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: now will n/s try for game here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  vul 2N seems a bit rich with W hand|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello everyone, Sveta:)|pg||
nt|flash: supposedly because, as a country boy, wearing shoes hurt his feet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well then:  xx   KTx   KQx   QJTxx|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will Westrun in 5 @D DOUBLED...|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks conventional but not sure what |pg||
nt|peachy: Lavazza should hope for exciting hands instead of pushes, otherwise harder to catch up later|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: in Hans' case, not removing his shoes might indicate fewer tricks than available...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 4-9 HCP, 5+@H & 4+@C/@D|pg||
nt|peachy: I still have suspicion 2NT was not denying hearts, perhaps to show the 12-14 instead of more wideranging options included in 1C|pg||
nt|po-s: probably "Polish" |pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart king fatal|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  vul attempt - it always deserves trying|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N considering 4N|pg||
nt|roswolf: consensus seems against bidding|pg||
nt|shevek: 2 flat hands, no source of tricks... 1NT it is|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sfoxa:  hi Raija, welcome|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not cold, I think. You have a losing option in @C|pg||
nt|jcwla: Do you like X or 3@D?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: 2N vul against not has limited appeal|pg||
nt|jtr: I am not sure Scotland wasnt joined to europe when he was there:)|pg||
nt|dburn: East unwilling to overcall, perhaps on the basis that his hand is too good - immediate overcalls destructive in nature|pg||
nt|peachy: nt apparent;ly 16-18 or something|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You have 10 slo tricks in 4 @H, but before that, defense will have 4 or 5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  slow|pg||
nt|po-s: 4 of a major and a longer minor|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|peachy: NS got another chance|pg||
nt|larrymori: just what east wanted to see pard bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: will W float this?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially since the suit is likely to be weak|pg||
nt|po-s: he should - 2NT should be this kind of hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe W not on same wavelength, as he had other options over the D|pg||
nt|larrymori: something about trying to improve part scores is not a good philosophy|pg||
nt|sybarra: esp. at this vul |pg||
nt|marlowepi: trump needed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and logical|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t like these 2-openings|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|andyv:  S to the rescue|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nice 5 @D - if they bid the slam|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not now - why is West passing?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: declarer wind and leads jack of hearts, covered. N must unblock, and duck 2nd heart to S's 8|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  nice plan for expert's book )))|pg||
nt|xenya: this should go down a few|pg||
nt|po-s: The opponents do|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and you PO?|pg||
nt|xenya: wrong hand for the gadget|pg||
nt|po-s: The Laws say the game should be played in a friendly way|pg||
nt|tejjyid: sadly, I would probably bid with the South cards|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess 80 is a possible result here, too.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: can do better|pg||
nt|sybarra2: really esciting |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: EW off the hook |pg||
nt|pelu: NS could also go for penalty against EW - 2@CX = 500|pg||
nt|sybarra: must say that the W hand looks more like what I usually hold|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes e came in expecting the weak hand in south|pg||
nt|dburn: if classical strong club, yes - 17-19 or even 17-20 more common ranges nowadays|pg||
nt|peachy: ok, I'm old school|pg||
nt|flash: this is the kind of deal which decides matches - much less short matches like this|pg||
nt|flash: to some extent, the @D call helps North - whatever values South has might well include some in @Cs|pg||
nt|peachy: good decision, 5D would only tumble one or so|pg||
nt|xenya: very unlikely at these colours and with W being silent throughout|pg||
nt|sybarra: same auction in OR '|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 2@H denies a top honor  - but that doesn't surprise Klinger|pg||
pc|sA|nt|peachy: dblfits all around, and now that was brought to daylight|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I mean - the lead must be a @D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Service-double - earns nothing, helps N/S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: X|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nice contract - on a @S-lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Do we all bid 1 @S - I do not|pg||
pc|s5|nt|xenya: seems a small spade allows to make it -- a club lead would have been more challenging|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont care for 2S but because of 2/1 South is not limited -anyway should still stop in 3NT|pg||
nt|shevek: 3NT is the winner here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H-ruff needed|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|xenya: strictly speaking, yes, but you can get a fairly good count on the E hand i think|pg||
nt|flash: East suggests defense vs 5@Ss and strongly suggests that West not bid more (especially vulnerable)|pg||
nt|peachy: I agree with Jim's explanation, for what its worth|pg||
nt|flash: Hans actually sneaked in a good point - suggesting/directing the @D lead was important here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah   1N already said 12-14|pg||
nt|othered1: Pointed out that in OR, north will open 1N|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session2.htm scoretables|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even w/o dbl - could be gain for NS|pg||
nt|hawe45:  NorthÂ´s opening bid pushed E/W to game, equalling the match|pg||
nt|othered1: with no trump lead and very friendly breaks, this can play well on cross ruff.|pg||
nt|sybarra: as you see they made 5 in the other room,   @h and ht continuation |pg||
nt|hlortz: oh im NOT defending their bidding LOL you have 19 pard opens and you dont move past 3n.|pg||
nt|peachy: X more flexible|pg||
nt|po-s: I guess the Canadians are well behind - although Raptor sounds old|pg||
pc|h7|nt|othered1: as cards lie, can make 5 by going up ace, |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S2 lead is ATTITUDE  [seems an exaggeration of the suit]|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe helps - http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/2008/zagranica/friendly/cc_hol/van%20Prooijen-Verhees.pdf |pg||
pc|h3|nt|hawe45:  Nice @D-suit - brings 4 tricks to East-West|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh - cancel|pg||
nt|po-s: Hans, asusual you are right - North will cover the Dten and yes, four tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D could lead to 3D cold for 3N or 4S|pg||
nt|ritong: 140 later, next|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a differnt way to go minus|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@s just can't be right... why is S in such a rush to show a bad suit?|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont see why South volunteered a bid in front of partner|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it stil is joined to Europe, it's just that part of the way is under water|pg||
nt|peachy: this has chances to chke, and I think it will|pg||
nt|peachy: S sensibly signs off|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer D from W on the first round of bidding. 15HP behind opener|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Both sides play trump - only one can be right|pg||
nt|shevek: was|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well that will put the kibosh on that, not to use vague antecedents.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: club lead would give declarer a chance to go down|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @s 9 - "partner, I have clubs" - seems so|pg||
nt|hawe45:  More fun here than in OR|pg||
nt|flash: XX shows 1st round control|pg||
nt|shevek: west is Johan Sylvan, a hugely successful poker player, but....pass was right|pg||
nt|sybarra: its 2 yrs old so at out own risk |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  life is more simple|pg||
nt|peachy: oh well, identifying number of aces hard even at this level of game|pg||
nt|jcwla: Huge opportunity missed.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: K or Q from S |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think best was to fly @CA, ruff @H  top @D pitching @C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  There is much to be said AGAINST this 4 @S 1) Suit is too short - but good 2 ) Hand can play also in @H - and @C|pg||
nt|po-s: Johan is also a very good bridgeplayer|pg||
nt|odysseus69: will be ok in 4H but far from ideal spot|pg||
nt|shevek: looks like cuebids for @cs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: For newcomers. The other semi-final between Zimmermann and Bulgaria is over after 16 boards. Bulgaria has conceded, 54 IMPs adrift|pg||
nt|odysseus69: without 2/1 North would simply bid 3NT over 2 hearts - instead we have a lot of head scratching|pg||
nt|shevek: 5@c at risk on a @s lead...|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will he find it ?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|flash: notice that the @D lead would hold this to 11 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: I am surprise the diamond lead didnt come, after West's valiant effort|pg||
nt|flash: to quote David Berkowitz:  if  i'd bid @Cs, would you have led a @D????|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes true|pg||
nt|peachy: make*|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually -- I'd try 2N|pg||
nt|larrymori: 2@c p/c was not so attractive so he figured maybe a 62 or 61 might be better|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6c on a diamond lead is ok|pg||
nt|peachy: if HA led and no club switch, declarer has chance|pg||
nt|jcwla: If @HA led, director called.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: Nice for once to see instant scoring outside Scandinavia and Poland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can we hope for America to follow suit?|pg||
nt|hlortz: in 10 or 20 years|pg||
nt|peachy: she could even play low and make|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West should have bid 5 @C - to get a @D-leas...!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  lead|pg||
nt|hlortz: X for me|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Have we made the "Who needs Aces" jokes yet?|pg||
nt|peachy: i was just going to say something like that, thanks though!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  sure... 40 or 50 years from now|pg||
nt|peachy: I was only defending E bidding which may have been systemic:)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: this plays very well|pg||
nt|shevek: shd be ok now|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  ACBL just got around to approving negative dbls:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  wiil S be brave enough to return a trump?|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Hans, sorry I am late|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello kibitzers:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK - welcome|pg||
nt|peachy: I see we have a strong match going here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Defense have misplayed the @C-suit|pg||
nt|loganrun: South has done well here to limit the losses|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Andrew.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|po-s: Could South possibly have 8401|pg||
nt|shevek: on a @s lead though, needs the @c guess|pg||
nt|peachy: we've been more subtle about it Andrew:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Hi |pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: too well perhaps|pg||
nt|peachy: Hans, I didnt know you had good sense of humor :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I have had|pg||
nt|po-s: trump queen and a club|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Some play this DONT -. or others, where D = 1-suiter|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now a @S to endplay east|pg||
pc|s8|nt|marlowepi: it wasnt just 19, it was about the crispest 19 imagineable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe 3N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: shd be easy now|pg||
nt|shevek: tell him Sunil :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i just did :)|pg||
mc|8|nt|marlowepi: top D before H ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right -- unblock Ace first|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the soup now,  with q of @S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: difficult to comment onopening lead but it didnt sound like declarer had KQJ lof diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Perhaps 54 IMPs not exactly concession-territory, but their decision of course|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Funnily enogh Zimmermann was 54 IMPs ahead before the last segment in the French Premier League last Saturday  ... and lost on a tie-break!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe the Bulgarians did not hear about that|pg||
nt|shevek: or they hate tie-breaks :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: EW 2@H perhaps|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I only see losers here|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 2 the overcall of 2 @C pushed e/w to 3 @D -1 |pg||
nt|hlortz: 3n here for ns will they bid it?|pg||
nt|dburn: he needed to, for some reason - not quite sure what that was all about|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I see - he went up with the jack on the first round of hearts|pg||
nt|flash: our skepticism of the board 2 result is the 1 IMP on the scoreboard so far|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the problem with 2N is that it is an underbid|pg||
nt|loganrun: 8311 perhaps|pg||
nt|shevek: results updated now at: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec_bul.html|pg||
nt|po-s: then it would be necessary to grab the CA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Cheap adventure|pg||
nt|shevek: trumps 6-0 in OR :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not the ideal trump break|pg||
nt|shevek: abt one in a hundred|pg||
nt|odysseus69: a take ot double of 2S would be well received by South|pg||
nt|peachy: lets see who gets the better of this board|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Shift was easy -- seeing all 4 hands!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good for the match!|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 11 boards ... 10 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: likely 3S by S|pg||
nt|dburn: but I don't have much idea why he did that, with K9x in his hand|pg||
nt|peachy: then it was a case of "monkey fell from tree"|pg||
nt|ritong: delicate hand|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S is likely here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Chance to get most of 'em right back.|pg||
nt|peachy: only needs diam finesse so not bad|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, hard to see a pressing need to bid this to slam|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 38 imps is a handy lead but not in surmountable in 29 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this alert?  is it "could be 2" |pg||
nt|dburn: maybe playing for West to have @h10x and no entry, but that seems a bit of a view|pg||
nt|xenya: i tend to agree with W's pass -- the fact that you are behind the opener doesn't matter much with his holding -- no tenaces, just controls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=3+@C, not 4@C & 4@D [1@D]|pg||
nt|odysseus69: h + minor probably|pg||
nt|shevek: same method in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Still no game|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not everybodyÂ´ s taste that 2 NT - facing a passed partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes you need to make that call with an undistinguished balanced 16. here you are close to 8 trix in yr own hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but DBL expects to hear more @H from LHO|pg||
nt|loganrun: but that means that he has ace of hearts and king of clubs outside of his trump suit|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With the bare @C King, South would have taken the kead in his hand to play @C King|pg||
nt|othered1: Why was that making?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6D attractive spot single dummy|pg||
nt|othered1: Wasn't the last -1?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lead directing pass|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@s, P, P, X?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you don't normally bid slams on a finesse though, unless you like action|pg||
nt|peachy: apparently 3S is forcing, many use conventions here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, Lavazza may feel need to push - and Zimmermann may act on assumption Lavazza will push.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 50% ismore ofan alibi than a reason|pg||
mb|1N|nt|peachy: this will be a very tight match, both teams have some of the world's best pairs playing,  and Fantunes, perhaps theeee best|pg||
nt|marlowepi: EW rate to go minus in game here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you are going to hear more hearts, it matters little what you do|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=3+,  1@D=4+@H|pg||
nt|hawe45:  lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: lets let operator sort it out |pg||
nt|sybarra: I think it was|pg||
nt|ritong: well, it would be nice to stop that low|pg||
nt|tejjyid: mind you, once the 5-5 appears with North, things change a little|pg||
nt|peachy: Zimmerman might think now the diamond finess if needed, is likely working|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I play 5@S here as pretty much a slam try - so I would have to X to avoid trouble - not an ideal method on this hand at all|pg||
nt|jcwla: Might be an implication of fewer values for 3@S than for say a 3@H cuebid.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: although 5@C is not pretty|pg||
nt|peachy: I think many/most agree that X is putting on the brakes|pg||
nt|peachy: hard to see that happening though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: oh yes, I'm sure, but you really "want" to play 5 without inviting 6 |pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: if S doesnt bid them now, the S willl be lost forever|pg||
nt|flash: X reasonable, but now without risk - my partners always bid 2@D...|pg||
nt|flash: note the 1NT call without a stopper|pg||
nt|flash: values first, shape 2nd??|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sounds right|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and you will be outbidden in a lot of hands:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: pretty good 6@H here with west opening|pg||
nt|peachy: now this 1NT will drive bulgarians to six|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@D=@Hs i'm sure|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Al|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this seems to have become the popular defence v 1NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: hard to aviod|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 5 tricks with the @H ruff - 800 is OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: anyone X 1@H with south?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no thin double by South|pg||
nt|jtr: 4 cards suits?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: oh yes|pg||
nt|shevek: no guts|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  strange 1N... even if playing 4 card majors|pg||
nt|flash: Duboin has obviously heard "6-4, come alive"|pg||
nt|flash: and maybe even 6-5|pg||
nt|peachy: well, I erred, Fantoni-Nunes not playing now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  E/W can take the first 11 tricks against 1 NT|pg||
nt|xenya: sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even Kokish might think North too good for 1@H overcall :)|pg||
nt|po-s: did Ish never cash his ace?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I wonder |pg||
nt|larrymori: cant imagine not|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe they just miscounted|pg||
nt|othered1: As usual, our running score isn't remotely official -- the players will get it right in comparisons.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: fixed noww|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South isunlikely to get too excited|pg||
nt|othered1: North doesn't have values to go solo beyond game|pg||
nt|tejjyid: is North well known as aslam enthusiast?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: another flat bd i presume|pg||
pc|d5|nt|po-s: JC doesn´t quite believe the explanation|pg||
nt|loganrun: that as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: "we" are either explaining, deep in thought or crashing |pg||
nt|po-s: I thought they played some miniclub  thing, pretty natural, like he played) with Jansma|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well, good pass by East. A bit soft all in all, to consider continuing.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Maybe I overstated the risk of the 5@S bid|pg||
nt|peachy: so 13 right back to Zimmerman|pg||
pc|d4|nt|peachy: prob same as open rm|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think N takes the push to 3...faster than I could type|pg||
nt|peachy: not a bad choice, d finesse near 100%|pg||
nt|marlowepi: its over|pg||
nt|po-s: 1S was puppet to 1NT|pg||
nt|sybarra2: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Double presumably showed 4+@S|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  why not a simple raise?|pg||
nt|jtr: wow aggressive double|pg||
nt|jtr: Just right at MPs|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in their lucky day EW win @s game|pg||
nt|peachy: good start, W raised|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  main problem - to bid it|pg||
nt|peachy: lose 2h and 3s|pg||
nt|flash: the stopperless 1NT does have its potential drawbacks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and against 2 NT also|pg||
nt|peachy: LOL|pg||
nt|peachy: how about 3NT Hans|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm starting to think that the long run winner for South is to PASS the DBL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this could be ugly for EW very soon|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4C was a lot to bid with 11 adjusted losers and all 5 HCP in opps' suits|pg||
nt|po-s: oops|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will be better if he loses to the D|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|dburn: good decision by West here - that raise wasn't automatic|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm unfamiliar with ew system, for me raise would not have occurred to me|pg||
nt|peachy: they did well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=transfer|pg||
nt|loganrun: this hand will play well as well|pg||
nt|po-s: 1C was clubs or wk or 18-19 NT, 1H showed spades|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D 9 - dangerous shift|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @DQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this solved everything for E!|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: for the match ie|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: sry 13 boards including this one|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: even if Gower doesn't lead a minor -- still only 9 tricks  [i think]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once S bids 3S, as he should, they arein slam|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: sounds like penalties, with good hearts|pg||
nt|jtr: Aiming for the KOD Roland?|pg||
nt|andyv:  S probably wanted to dbl the first time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Going for the KOD is tempting at MP|pg||
nt|Walddk2: KOD = Kiss of Death|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes!|pg||
nt|pelu: normal lead - only a @S could give S some problems|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Let me count|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Edgar Kaplan is rolling over in his sepulchre Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe|pg||
nt|po-s: not so ugly|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow !! ugly all right, but for NS|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2NT will preumableslow North a little|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hawe45:  Here they only get 10, I think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No comments from now...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hi Vlad -- i'm not really here, just adding some explanations of alerts if i can|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Welcome!|pg||
nt|po-s: 1S was consistent with a wk NT with 2-3 spades...|pg||
nt|po-s: how is 6|pg||
nt|po-s: looks like def can make 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: excellent switch |pg||
nt|ralfwil: but still -1|pg||
nt|po-s: Bochi was afraid the clubs might become established|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|hlortz: aka 200|pg||
nt|Walddk2: -200 at matchpoints|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trump lead was better, and logical on the auction and the W hand|pg||
nt|chick: kind of a waste of the 10|pg||
nt|peachy: its cold, dont think any lead woulda caused a prob|pg||
nt|flash: but an important lesson:  the defenders can't see your hand...|pg||
nt|peachy: silence|pg||
nt|hawe45:  20 tricks in difference or so|pg||
nt|xenya: this looks simple enough|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard to guess the spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but if N leads heart queen...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  second try is still available|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how will he get to dummy?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ruffing clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not before hearts are led by S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N leads a club, jack is the correct card. then ten of hearts|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  your are right, Marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W does best to rise and lead a club, but NS can still prevail, though there is scope for error|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe 1 or 2 imps to Z|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: pause -- in case Klinger has ducked @DA??|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but is N still thinking...|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pelu: wrong J by pd - and he has 3 of them :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Bulgaria matched the 4@S contract on 19 - and two overtricks for 2 IMPs to 23-zip.|pg||
nt|hlortz: bulgarians are going full speed ahead|pg||
nt|peachy: N gambled, W could have had Ax spades and KQxx xlubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1N could easily turn out to be an underbid, e.g. if N held:   KJxx   Axx   AKQxx  x   they would play 3N with 6D near cold|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice auction from Vladi Isporski|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks an entry short to use all threats, but i may be wrong|pg||
nt|larrymori: the game bonus makes it compelling to raise with the south hand|pg||
nt|po-s: ruff diamond, 2xtrumps A of D to throw a spade,  ruff and SK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dburn: and on board 18 West kept NS out of 4@s by opening 1@s on five low and a pile of dingo's kidneys|pg||
nt|othered1: South may feel has two free bids were enough and 4@D is likely defined as NF|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but now lost the chance to defeat|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You make it by taking @D 10 with the King|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Now you can make an overtrickm playing on @C|pg||
nt|po-s: and now a club finesse?|pg||
nt|ritong: duboin might cumulate chances|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: 2@H would have been weaker hand than 2N  --- not sure what 3@C asks :(|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|nt|pelu: how do u play on a @s-lead?? - can u make 3NT? |pg||
nt|peachy: well, perhaps I am wrong, fforgot the 3S bid after hearts were set by 3H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for Duboin to have opening bid, he MUST hold @DK|pg||
nt|peachy: wd|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: push on 3 -- same contract, same result in the OR|pg||
nt|jcwla: Highly impressive.|pg||
nt|ritong: first try for the @s drop, and if it fails try @d hook|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh - no entry any longer|pg||
nt|pelu: prob on an endplay of West?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|xenya: it could be beaten double dummy -- @H lead, A, @H ruff, underlead @Cs, another @H ruff -- and there is another trick for the defence -- but now it makes|pg||
nt|po-s: fortunately no|pg||
pc|s8|nt|peachy: you could from the beginning but why bother too much, IMPs|pg||
nt|dburn: so that was 11 IMPs to The Latin, who usually make a good showing in this tournament|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks reasonable to me.  |pg||
nt|ritong: there is also a throw in possibility|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and the spade drop will work  but will he hook it|pg||

nt|po-s: but will beat this or should|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I´m not awake. He won with @cK|pg||

nt|mdgraham: about 16|pg||

nt|hlortz: 7 @D @H or NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so you would expect a flat 7N across the field |pg||

nt|jbgood: there are always a mix-up somewhere|pg||
nt|Walddk2: TGR's Bridge Club is located in Central London, near Marble Arch. TGR is short for The Great Rose, named after the late and great Great Britain player, Irving Rose|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so far the standard fo card play has not matched the quaity of the bidding|pg||
nt|tez: nicely played|pg||
nt|po-s: misplaying diamonds like that...|pg||
nt|po-s: sorry, you didn´t even need that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N might have bid 5D there, as the 4C bid helped him...it looks like S is not loaded in clubs so is likely to have D ace|pg||
nt|sybarra: was 4 @D the right bid?  may 5?|pg||
nt|larrymori: he did bid it 3 times, south can raise|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that looks like gain for NS - they have no game for easy play |pg||
nt|xenya: that was very strange|pg||
nt|po-s: oops I thought he had three clubs...|pg||
nt|shevek: I guess would be penalty|pg||
nt|shevek: but they might run to 2NT|pg||
nt|sybarra2: I didnt mean to suggest he do that!|pg||
nt|jcwla: There was a 3@H cuebid in the OR and at that point 6 a more reasonable shot, I think this was a better auction and justly rewarded.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 12 boards 12 imps|pg||
nt|shevek: this accident in the OR will cost only 5 imps|pg||
mb|1D|nt|hawe45:  @S-guess is worth 1 IMP here|pg||
nt|flash: 3@S made E-W on that one, so a potentially very big 7 IMPs|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Here N/S can take the first ?? tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they won't mind that 1 imp loss at all|pg||
nt|sybarra: he had of the things! |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but somehow I doubt every pair will bid 7N|pg||
nt|po-s: the spot cards in D and H were crucial - should have made|pg||
nt|hawe45:  -Ready for another partscore|pg||
nt|po-s: Carruthers never get to bid his hearts...unless 2D was multi|pg||
nt|pelu: now on slam-level|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely n/s draws a dble here |pg||
nt|peachy: 12-15 bal, 19+ any, and two more options|pg||
nt|flash: again, the multi-meaning 1@C opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like Bulgarian EW also playing big club   their auction begins  1@D-DBL-P-2@C|pg||
nt|hlortz: need to get to NT not @H here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=(21)22-23|pg||
nt|sybarra: that didnt get in my comment|pg||
nt|othered1: I put the last board into the "stuff happens" category, along with many other 8-card suit hands.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sfoxa:  NS got lot of points again.  @h game? NT?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And the Multi might help declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings after 2 rounds|pg||

nt|hlortz: 5@H now??|pg||
nt|tez: 1@c opening means..nat or 16+any hand..polish club|pg||
nt|sybarra: I agree with 5 @H |pg||
nt|dburn: I neither - they were 19th in the standings after four rounds, but not sure what they did in their last match|pg||
nt|sybarra: 8 |pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: They won't|pg||
nt|sybarra: puts n/s in a spot quickly |pg||
nt|tez: bid or not to bid..pass is not forcing i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: for all N knows,  S may have no clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: 16+ nat or 12-18 4441|pg||
nt|xenya: weak 1N?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Â´Looks like a flat 3 NT here|pg||
nt|sybarra: Ed, you are so gracious @H|pg||
nt|peachy: 3H might have been showing spades, hi-for-hi cuebid|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Maybe, partner won;t bid differently with AKxx, AKxxxx though & wont often have much less|pg||
nt|peachy: but I dont know|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pelu: 5NT? = I can play slam in 2 suits?|pg||
nt|dburn: still, if they are up against The Latin their results can't have been bad|pg||
nt|peachy: if the have puppet, easy|pg||
nt|jcwla: Oh yeah it clearly was.  But again -- so many IMPs turn on such hands and where a particular card is.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I guess there is a risk partner still has 2@C, iftheopp|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if the opponents are reckelss types|pg||
nt|peachy: if he had AKxxxx in diam and same hand, he would Pass|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this shd also be flat when Lavazza is looking for swingy hands|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Some will not even be in a grand slam. Just wait and see|pg||
nt|po-s: which it probably ewas|pg||
nt|xenya: on 18, EW in the other room didn't find the 4@S save -- 8 imps to World Youth|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the X shows @S or just cards?|pg||
nt|tez: strong opening |pg||
nt|sybarra: will S bid 7?|pg||
nt|tez: i thk|pg||
nt|pelu: cards I exp - but spect can correct me :)|pg||
nt|tez: 6 enuf:)|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like that|pg||
nt|sybarra: slightly different auction in other room  since 1 @H=sp |pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least that's what the old convention card says :(|pg||
nt|hlortz: oh never mind 10 tricks in @H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: easier without it|pg||
nt|peachy: but S decided not to even look, reasonable decision with 4333|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I think 4 @D is "testing pard"  doesnt pard have to have at least a couple of @D's (with honor) to bid 3 nt?|pg||
nt|othered1: is north allowed to raise?|pg||
nt|peachy: less informative auction here than OR|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, anyway, u can never argue with success|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a spec tells me "13 imps- 12 is still Z win" |pg||
mb|3H|nt|tez: he will bid pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree  but S has to like his hand |pg||
nt|loganrun: strightforward 3NT after West shows 18-19 bal|pg||
mb|3S|nt|andyv:  3@d by S seems to make things easier|pg||
nt|sybarra: the @d suit most likely the one in question |pg||
nt|flash: 2@D natural and VERY positive|pg||
nt|flash: grand slam easy from here - far more difficult to reach at the table?|pg||
nt|peachy: 2D 5+ C or D, usually gf|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A 2 C-overcall by East, might have brought some trouble for N/S |pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @C|pg||
nt|flash: SPECS!!!   287 people in here and there's virtual silence!!!   c'mon - talk to us|pg||
nt|sybarra: skip that |pg||
nt|marlowepi: N did not want to lead a trump because he was worried about hearts affording discards. he preferred clubs to diamonds for an unusual reason--they were weaker, i.e. he hoped the ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club ten would best serve the defense if the suit was not attacked from his side|pg||
nt|othered1: Not really|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow. well, he has 3 hearts and the 3 of hearts. must be why he bid 3H|pg||
nt|shevek: identical auction in the OR|pg||
nt|shevek: looking at the movie, seems unlikely -3 in the previous bd|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5D is 500- no big deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: at least 3@c gets some strength across i imagine|pg||
nt|sybarra: to Zmud|pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand will be at sprint speed of play |pg||
nt|pelu: 6@Hs will only cost 800 - but rish that opp bid 7 - and then he also has to bid 7@H|pg||
nt|tez: and also 7@s..then:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: (when he decides play) |pg||
nt|dburn: looks like strong club for both pairs, given that 1@d opening|pg||
nt|flash: private msgs only to any commentator who has +++ in their profile|pg||
nt|hawe45:  5 @C Voidwould - and South is taken by surprise|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Voidwood|pg||
nt|peachy: 2D was 5+ DIAM and usually GF, I made a mistake, thanks friendly spec!!!|pg||
nt|flash: i've seen this b4...|pg||
nt|flash: 5@C (obviously???) intended as exclusion - but....|pg||
nt|peachy: 2H showed H stopper!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|peachy: he surely has it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  7 NT is the spot - nu risc for @D-ruff|pg||
nt|hawe45:  no|pg||
nt|po-s: will Ish double finess clubs?|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well,  I will let it drop |pg||
nt|larrymori: but the north hand had no aces too with strength behind|pg||
nt|peachy: oh yes you can, Andrew!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: there was a flat grand (13 tables) at the YC once - about 30 years ago |pg||
nt|sybarra: this is lesson for all......think at first trick |pg||
nt|shevek: and a vulnerable sac !|pg||
nt|tejjyid: after the last auction, this one is making me nervous|pg||
nt|ritong: sementa certainly had 3@s available to ask for help|pg||
nt|othered1: this became an extremely bulky auction.|pg||
nt|ritong: in that suit|pg||
nt|sybarra2: do "we" know where we are going?|pg||
nt|othered1: A lot depends on details of NS's methods, but this doesn't seem to be an easy hand to bid in theirs.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North probably thinks he is cue-ing in support of @H; but unless NS play Reese-Shapiro, that maynotbe so clear to South|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Now 7NT is easy|pg||
nt|andyv:  one of the few hands 2/1 players would have an easy time with|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning, afternoon, evening, as you please|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Roland!|pg||
nt|po-s: it looks like 8 tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 NT is the limit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N would have asked if opener held 3 or 4@S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I just leaned, that 4 @H is not making even with the double dunny-play af @D King - South kills it by playing @D Queen when he takes @H King. In Denmark we have morning - and snow is fallingb|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Madala will probably try for @D ak onside before trying the @C fin|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, Zimmerman has half an imp ahead|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jbgood: Blackwood is a fine convention|pg||
nt|flash: standings at   http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Very heavy 1 NT - or?|pg||
nt|po-s: or just establish spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N was worried in particular aboutheart strength behind him, which E rated to have for his strong bidding|pg||
nt|tejjyid: apparently they don't|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sfoxa:  so, first push?|pg||
nt|peachy: i'm sure that is correct|pg||
nt|ritong: i seriously doubt about the reese shapiro part|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jtr: KC is even better|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one pair in 4@H|pg||
nt|peachy: make, prob with overtrick|pg||
nt|flash: check the Daily Bulletins - they're among the best in the world...   a Rigal-Colker production paid advertisement...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: lets see|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H?! That will make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the second double was quite an overbid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once N cannot even make a responsive double over 3H, really S shd subside|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: two in six|pg||
nt|peachy: nice switch|pg||
nt|xenya: trappy hand -- they are bound to end up in 3N -- and they did|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=long suit game try -- not sure why that is an alert|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt S brought his rabbi  (play ace with K is singleton off side) |pg||
nt|xenya: i womder what system NS are playing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both players strong NT with their regular partners|pg||
nt|shevek: 2 imps only though|pg||
pc|s3|nt|peachy: he has a cost free chance to try find the Q|pg||
nt|dburn: and of course, whenever you open some minimum in 4th chair partner always punishes you by jumping to 2NT|pg||
nt|flash: 1 key card for @Hs, excluding @Cs...    but a big swing in a short match|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East will attack @C before @D - finessing @D into the hand without @SS-trick|pg||
nt|po-s: as he has very few entries to the spades...|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd think an immediate 3@C with the north hand would be Reesean.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jtr: Didnt bother about the @dQ expecting South to have 3 @ds|pg||
nt|hlortz: bidding will take longer than the play|pg||
nt|jtr: There are a few less experienced pairs in the field remember|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1 IMP - the first for NL|pg||
nt|peachy: well, NS are pretty much done, E will make|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Maybe South didÂ´nt like his hand with 2 suits without stopper|pg||
nt|po-s: I think the 4spades doubled got misscored - - it was 2 down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: plus N was already a passed hand so had some leeway to stretch to bid over 3H|pg||
nt|tejjyid: in aconstructive sense, absolutely|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: well played|pg||
nt|peachy: and he did do that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so  Fu expected either weaker hand with @D & @S or  stronger would take another call|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: yes, 3 trumps, a spade and 4 tricks in the minors -- EW can't do anything about that|pg||
nt|po-s: particularly now|pg||
nt|tejjyid: mind you, opening the hand 1NT is quite Reese-ian as well|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: too right -- pure values in @S & @D = old fashioned 1@D instead of 1N |pg||
nt|ahollan1: note - would NOT do that if @D & @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think well judged actions from both players|pg||
nt|po-s: ah, shouldn´t have covered|pg||
nt|larrymori: covering was probably not right|pg||
nt|larrymori: gives an entry to the north hand|pg||
nt|larrymori: the high spades rate to be separate so better than 33 @cs|pg||
nt|po-s: in the other room declarer won the forst heart, finessed - covered diamonds and played a club (queen), unblocked ten and then finessed clubs|pg||
nt|shevek: trump is best|pg||
nt|othered1: But that wasn't an option here|pg||
nt|ritong: no matter what, duboin and sementa are in a bad moment|pg||
pc|d3|nt|peachy: now S must find the right lead to set, will she? small d but of course we see all cards|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No danger, @H Ace will not be missed|pg||
nt|jcwla: Lavazza got to 3NT so 12 more coming to Bulgaria.  Up 35-0 now.|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks Al|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dburn: Patrick Huang tells me that Lin has played for Taiwan in the Venice Cup, and that Nie is from China where she is a celebrated Go player|pg||
nt|peachy: I mean *he|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kantar article in most recent ACBL Bulletin would have said 3N was the ONLY decision|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this cud be down too|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|peachy: thanks for the info|pg||
nt|marlowepi: contradiction in terms. if it is the only call, there is no decision|pg||

pc|c2|nt|hawe45:  But wait a minute - only 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm -- was declarer supposed to play @CQ before @S?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doesn't matter on this hand, but if Klinger held 3@C instead of 4 -- he would be truly endplayed now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: a swing is possible here -- but more likely EW in the OR will also reach 3N declared by E |pg||
nt|xenya: but we will see|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice @c10|pg||
nt|ritong: losing a makeable 3NT with 4@s cold, and the very next board being in five voluntarily  ugh|pg||
pc|cA|nt|shevek: I thk he lost 1@s, 1@h and 2@c|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the first double was questionable also, since S is not prepared for a response even of 2D. a 2C overcall has flaws too of course|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: what should we say of this 2H overcall, at unfavorable colors facing a passed partner with a poor and short suit, no real hand, and the worst possible holding in the opps' suit? ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the diplomat in me votes for "fearless"|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Good hand for the weak NT - get it played y East :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, this time 9 is better than the JACK...how can that happen???:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's outrageous.  But of course the Jack works if North has underlead AQxxx|pg||
nt|brgpro: i thought the Jack shd work all the time?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: you need North to have 2 honours - if one is the ten you should play the jack :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps one MIGHT decide that if North has AQ of spades to length, and the club king, then he might have taken a bid?|pg||
nt|jtr: I was thinking K if North had bid @ss But he chose not to|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bjacobs: There is just so little to go on|pg||
nt|brgpro: well...guessing time on the first trick|pg||
nt|brgpro: i hate this...no clue, i usually guess wrong|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If he gets it wrong will he not drop @CK?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|jtr: You are in good company Jack|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I suppose he does not know North has 6 spades|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, because the @hA is also missing|pg||
nt|brgpro: so he won't try to drop the @cK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, dropping the club king doesn't seem reasonable|pg||
nt|jtr: South hasnt played yet|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Of course if South switches to hearts, and North switches back to spades, then dropping the club king IS reasonable|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, if S plays a @h and N switch back to @s, then there is every reason for W to drop the @cK|pg||

nt|Walddk2: One spec tells me that he is quite capable of going down in 4@H|pg||
nt|hlortz: 4 @H not a 0, one in 5@D!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: amazing the pair that stopped in 4@H - Gustawsson/Andersson of Sweden |pg||
nt|andyv:  another slam for NS|pg||
nt|hawe45:  One should learn counting|pg||
nt|hawe45:  600 without any @H-trick|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a triumph in the play for -500 against nothing:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W will now be bidding 3H a lot:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: and i left out "low offense-to-defense ratio" :)|pg||
nt|peachy: almost:)|pg||
nt|peachy: 11|pg||
nt|dburn: OK, got it - Nie is he and Lin is she|pg||
nt|bucheister: he made 11|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I presume this is West thinking|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: they shd have a coffee perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: he hoped that D were 33|pg||
nt|sybarra: shall we take book on push for that bd?  |pg||
nt|pelu: pnly 2 results from OR? - strange|pg||
nt|jcwla: "Me or your lying eyes?"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe not operator|pg||
nt|ahollan1: P-1@H|pg||
nt|loganrun: Another 3NT|pg||
nt|po-s: You must realize I was here until 4 this morning, now it is 10.24|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: or something stronger :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks nasty for e/w|pg||
nt|shevek: can't blame EW in the OR for bidding 3NT with 27 count...|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mdgraham: 7N scores 36 out of 58.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  could habe been in  20|pg||
nt|sybarra: they have lost connection 2 times |pg||
nt|flash: i think we'll see that hand in tomorrow's (today"s???) Daily Bulletin|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ish & Bach both strong backgrounds in Acol -- would be surprised if they also play 3NN|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s a hand, where you might bid 4 @S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then the spades block & N can duck a club|pg||
nt|po-s: I guess he will have to go for clubs then|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but if W doesnt shake a spade...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|tez: nice coment shirley..i agree|pg||
nt|sybarra: the question will be if they "reconnect" the tables |pg||
nt|larrymori: with the @cs 33 and the |pg||
nt|marlowepi: of course, if N had known toi pass the second double, it would have been NS who collected 500 against nothing|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: I would open the E hand at any colors. many would disagree of course, but it is an opening bid by many well-respected yardsticks|pg||
nt|peachy: 4H was again a transfer to 4S :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  almost :-)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and they lost connection again..... |pg||
nt|pelu: I am told that there are no connection to OR after 2 x crash|pg||
nt|sybarra: it can be done ...|pg||
nt|pelu: italian waiter ? :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East has 3 stoppers in the @S-suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right then must try clubs|pg||
nt|larrymori: it all started with the @d cover|pg||
nt|marlowepi: y|pg||
nt|sybarra: cold  6 @D can they get there?|pg||
nt|othered1: no|pg||
nt|sybarra: may even draw an X  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont see who would double|pg||
nt|po-s: Ish is going Polish?|pg||
nt|po-s: so they shouldn´t get to game now|pg||
nt|ritong: here, finding the sacrifice would be good|pg||
nt|ritong: since 4@h is cold|pg||
nt|shevek: if they can rightside it|pg||
nt|shevek: they did :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Impossible to bid this slam even with other opening bid from S|pg||
nt|sybarra: we had same problem with OR room yesterday |pg||
nt|tez: 1@d=@h's|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=art game force|pg||
nt|shevek: Apteker also opened 4@s in bd 19|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even after splinter, N's hand is worth trying|pg||
nt|marlowepi: absolutrely|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like they open 2C on balanced 19/20 in Open Room -  I know that 2D for this is quite popular but using 2C seems a bad idea- maybe I need to know the full system|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 3nt can be made with some inspiration i think - the rabbi would anyway|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pelu: 1@D sh be alerted|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=1-suiter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember  NS playing Precision so 1@S limited by failure to open 1@C [16+ HCP]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1H u mean|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's what i told the computer to display -- wonder where @S came from|pg||
nt|xenya: i would bid 4@S if my 6 4 were 10 9|pg||
nt|po-s: 1S as usual puppet to 1NT|pg||
nt|othered1: on the @D guess, of course.|pg||
mb|p|nt|larrymori: hard to bid it in the "suit" the opps opened|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Claim|pg||
nt|peachy: so much to find out, even after 1H opening|pg||
nt|hlortz: cosmic ray no doubt :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Remember it's north's unexpected @H shortness that makes this possible and south won't be able to work things out.|pg||
nt|po-s: but only three spades |pg||
nt|sybarra: and 2 @H? is shortness?|pg||
nt|larrymori: might end here|pg||
nt|larrymori: accepting the xfer|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure how to bid these perfecto hands...|pg||
nt|po-s: nono, 1NT I´m sure was banatural|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont think 2 @H was accepting transfer |pg||
nt|po-s: "acceptin" yes|pg||
nt|larrymori: why else would he bid it after a natural 1nt|pg||
nt|po-s: bot liking|pg||
nt|po-s: not|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is bot like!|pg||
nt|larrymori: reluctant bid after his move with the 1nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: is Bach in the tank?  dont like that |pg||
nt|po-s: are you Dutch?|pg||
nt|sybarra: no |pg||
nt|po-s: I know|pg||
nt|larrymori: well if he bids @ds, it will get them out of the hole|pg||
nt|sybarra: but seems strange to me |pg||
nt|sybarra: and possible director call (imo) |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: operator may have missed the subtle pointing to bidding card |pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  in mp, rather be in 3N or 5@d?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A lucky 3 NT here |pg||
nt|po-s: Did he really make nine tricks on the previous hand?|pg||
nt|tez: dbl is take/out to @s..strong hand|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@C = 12-14 ball, or 18-19 ball or natural @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: N to double? |pg||
nt|tez: no|pg||
nt|peachy: W has max and six cards, well done to Pass|pg||
nt|po-s: if 3D is only inviting....|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could end here?|pg||
nt|po-s: you kidding?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: isnt it forcing??|pg||
nt|larrymori: gotta be right to raise to game|pg||
nt|po-s: at least invitational IMO - would be forcing for me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: GF by UZPH, but at lease forcing here|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt N can pass,  with huge hand but now what |pg||
nt|marlowepi: well he caNT SPLINTER:):)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: If he "splinters" it will go all pass |pg||
nt|po-s: of course there is the possibility of a misunderstanding (1D opening)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another swedish international predicts  D from N|pg||
nt|po-s: In 3NT he must duck clubs twice to have a chnce|pg||
nt|sybarra: and if 3 @S what does S do? |pg||
nt|tejjyid: Opening leads 101|pg||
nt|shevek: double stopper in @s now, np|pg||
pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: how would you like to pass as E then put THIS dummy down in a mere 4 spades then watch pd go down?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: welcome to Patrick Huang |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Agree - will West make his 620? Double-finesse in @C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: slam good facing as little as:  KQxx   Jxx    x   AKxxx|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: yes -- when W didn't play his last spade to tap S|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|tez: 5@s or pass i thk|pg||
nt|tez: :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ashley Bach also led a small @C  [the 6]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think 3S, planning to bid 4C over3N|pg||
nt|po-s: I didn´t say it would make but that would be his only chance - 3 x clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the dutch guys wont even mind that much if they get to slam, the auction will have taken a year off NS lives|pg||
nt|shevek: this makes easily (1241)|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|dburn: and that is a slightly aggressive responsive double by South, but part score swings are generated by pushing your opponents around|pg||
nt|flash: note the 2@C call - the 6-card suit outweighs the 4-card length in @Hs, despite the fact that partner is far more likely to hold @Hs than @Cs|pg||
nt|flash: but, we seem to have run into the question of whether the 'free bid' shows values|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1 spec telling me that NS are NOT playing Precision at this tournament|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has good cards facing a splinter, but unable to cue 4D he must bid 4H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and S should have more than that|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  declarer will have to decide whether to finesse in spades... if it's on, the 5@d bidders will all be making 6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If the spade finesse is on I make 630 vs 620|pg||
nt|peachy: but|pg||
nt|gracelin: Thanks, Shrley and Hi all.|pg||
nt|peachy: oh, spoke too soon|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Patrick|pg||
nt|dburn: well, West was always going to bid 3@s, but no harm in seeing whether his opponents accidentally pass him out in 2@s doubled first|pg||
nt|po-s: what was the phrase? Youthful?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  and if it's off, you are down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently the pair that played 27 in 5@D did it against the leaders, which will do them no harm |pg||
nt|peachy: i see no chance for OT|pg||
nt|tez: they are leading 2/4|pg||
nt|sybarra: again we see the lead middle from 3 |pg||
nt|pelu: EW can defeat 4@S on a @S lead (DD decl can 2xfiness in @D and make)|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, he took the class|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be the decisive board|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: all leads 2/4......better way to describe it   (thx spec) |pg||
nt|hawe45:  But with the @S-vois, South has a few values|pg||
nt|hawe45:  void|pg||
nt|peachy: if 3D was GF he cant pass now...or can he|pg||
nt|flash: SJ Simon counseled :  how much worse could your hand be...    not much!!!???|pg||
nt|peachy: Also "How to bid misfits?"  A: "Don't"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He must take his chance - 4 @c was the first bid from North, which was - maybe - NOT forcing|pg||
nt|peachy: a spec says 3D asked for D stopper|pg||
nt|flash: most would play a cue bid forcing to game in major or NT, but only to 4-level in minor???|pg||
nt|peachy: I think that is a sensible way to play it|pg||
nt|flash: again, need to remove shoes to count losers in S hand???|pg||
nt|peachy: hearts behaving, Bulgaria can hardly lose on this deal, or Lavazza gain|pg||
nt|ritong: everybody made their duty|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|dburn: I suppose on this lie of cards North-South actually had some play for 4@h|pg||
pc|cT|nt|tez: 3 down is bad news for ew|pg||
nt|pelu: so all leads = I have a higher card in this suit!!|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes horrible suit breaks for decalarer good pass by south|pg||
nt|tez: if you have singleton?|pg||
nt|tez: lol:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: again OR just back,  I think the Italian waiters should be removed from that room!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Matt Mullamphy seems to be operating a bit here -- maybe HOPING to get to 8@S with his 2 sure trump tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: this is very close|pg||
pc|c6|nt|peachy: i would feel like the unluckiest person born|pg||
nt|peachy: I love all our Polish specs who help with NS system interpretation, for the benefit of all our gallery|pg||
nt|flash: 250 will be 6 IMPs back - tightening the match significantly|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will South find out, that this lead is a singleton?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|peachy: without def help, that is|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N were sure both on same page, would probably follow through with 4C. but wants as little confusion as possible hence 4D|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S9 is discouraging|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trump lead may make N work|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pelu: nice start for decl|pg||
nt|hlortz: still looks like -800 though|pg||
nt|tez: 1 way ticket for 800:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: yep|pg||
nt|sybarra: E is smart enough to know that N would not X with clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: and with the 2 @S bid, the long clubs should be with S |pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think N could have tried 5C over 4H, but he weas undoubtedly afraid S might think all this was cuebidding for hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think S bid 4 @H because he thought that was perhaps where they were suppose to play |pg||
nt|marlowepi: 7 rounds of bidding & 7 kilos of sweat later, a push|pg||
pc|sK|nt|peachy: and they arent helping so far|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and so declarer. but what about defence?|pg||
nt|peachy: but not for 3C|pg||
nt|po-s: true - but declarer is supposed to bid 1NT normally with the balanced hand|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Yes I think so too Goeffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup 14 imps to the leaders|pg||
mc|10|nt|shevek: 2@s over 2@c was a Xfer to 2NT|pg||

nt|cuttysark: And another 5 when Z&B stopped in 3@S on 53|pg||
nt|brgpro: hehe, remember the final of the vanderbilt i played against them|pg||
nt|brgpro: almost every 4 boards we smoke once...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Does it improve your bridge?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's disallowed in this event, but they don't seem to care|pg||
nt|brgpro: i dont know...but we won at the end...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What are they going to do in a KO match (final) if both pairs at one table agree? Subtract 100 IMPs from both teams?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I read somewhere that smoking increases the flow of bllod sugar - short term boost, more tiring over the long haul|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, we dont and cant smoke at the table|pg||
nt|brgpro: so we just go out all together|pg||
nt|cuttysark: There was a time.....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can't even leave the room to smoke it reads in the CoC|pg||
nt|jtr: that is generally the case nowadays|pg||
nt|brgpro: with B&Z? always....|pg||
nt|jtr: Although i did a while ago with Zmud|pg||
nt|jtr: I wont say where we went to smoke:)|pg||
nt|brgpro: whenever we play against them, you can see B-Z, Fu_zhao all go out together , then u will hear some polish or chinese...depends on which side feel bad about the match...|pg||
nt|jtr: B doesnt smoke does he?|pg||
nt|brgpro: of course he does|pg||

nt|peachy: hah, you belong to the school of "Always bid to win the post mortem" :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: show of hands -- who thought that hand would NEVER end|pg||
nt|peachy: Lavazza not used to scores like this|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if east does not shift to @C, then declarer can get a @H ruff and a spade trick|pg||
mb|1C|nt|hawe45:  West is lucky here - a Multi would nok be a success|pg||

nt|tez: other room 4@s doubled..specs said:)|pg||

nt|sybarra2: and Henri thought it was his eyes|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in the unlikely event that i passed originally as E, i doubt i could bring myself to pass 4S when pd bids it facing a passed hand at unfavorable vul with an unlinmited hand behind ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: him. if i did summon such conservatism, and then watched 4S go down, i'd head for the bar|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not used to countries that drink tea instead of coffee either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that confirms it -- definitely NOT Precision|pg||
nt|shevek: back to part scores....|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Italy keeps on trying 3 NT with 24 balanced HCP|pg||
nt|xenya: well it seems there were for the defence that might have let it through and declarer was never more than 1 down|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 11 tricks in nt or @d on EW|pg||
mb|1H|nt|peachy: not much of fit anywhere|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: this might be interesting|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yeah - @H not 3-3|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  May be doubled|pg||
nt|po-s: Sara needs to take 10 more victory points han SouthSweden|pg||
nt|shevek: 1NT, any idea?|pg||
nt|sybarra: we can all get whatever we are imbibing in here,  this is mundane |pg||
nt|marlowepi: 5D a good save. 4S cold single dummy on elimination thanks to 9 of hearts|pg||
nt|odysseus69: what now from South?|pg||
nt|shevek: 1@h?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: because of mirror distribution, 6@D is down|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s need something good to happen here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: S passes another opening bid by many standards|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm, if the suits were majors I'd open.|pg||
nt|loganrun: Forcing|pg||
nt|shevek: hmmm|pg||
nt|po-s: probably 1NT forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: naw, it would have been a scoop to watch a double sunstroke by balzmud|pg||
nt|peachy: I dont know their methods, but X could be Stayman/ish or it could be "values"|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I'd open S at any vul|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it would be better to have the minors reversed, but you cant have everything all the time|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has an interesting problem over 1H. i dont think 2H gets the job done. prefer 3H|pg||
nt|peachy: splinter would be my choice|pg||
nt|xenya: or cruel rather|pg||
nt|sybarra: does making only 4 seem 1 too few?|pg||
nt|loganrun: this part score may well be doubled|pg||
nt|marlowepi: will N pass or D?|pg||
nt|xenya: *were options |pg||
nt|shevek: south found a way to show some stuff|pg||
nt|ritong: can happen, of course, but only once a century|pg||
nt|sybarra2: :) |pg||
nt|tejjyid: nasty hand|pg||
nt|jcwla: I must confess I would not be thinking suit play w/the S hand.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is the hand which is the reason they tell you NOT to overbid your 6-5 shapes |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|Walddk4: Maybe someone in the audience can tell us what 2@D is|pg||
nt|peachy: club position fortunate|pg||
nt|po-s: hearts never break friendly in Japan|pg||
nt|peachy: aonly a few ricks for declarer here, we'll see how few|pg||
nt|peachy: tricks*|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This time - in 3 NT - the @D-suit must be handled well|pg||
nt|po-s: now 2S|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well maybe not|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S10 ias important / without a @S in Sount, North could be endplayed for the 12th yrisk in 6 @D|pg||
nt|po-s: The 3C in closed - East was thrown in after one diamond ducked (no heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: might even keep West out  |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Brave man, East|pg||
nt|shevek: what was wrong with pass?|pg||
nt|po-s: I think they play 14-16 NT so the 10point responder always assumes 16|pg||
nt|sybarra2: is N coming in ?  ah yess|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|flash: on this day in history, a modern, aggressive player passed a rotten 11-count in 2nd chair...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Otherwise no entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will this break the streak of all hands declared by either North or West?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: like a @DA lead on 6@S perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: which would in your book be weaker, Pass or 4D by N over 3H?|pg||
nt|tez: makeable 7@h..i belive they will stop 4@h|pg||
nt|pelu: the slam in board 5 was missed in OR (4@S + 3)|pg||
nt|tez: they are not playing with open cards:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting the OR is connected to us  but we are not reconnected to them |pg||
nt|sybarra: or should I say they were|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  temptation  to compete on 5th level?|pg||
nt|peachy: I think 2D here was very reasonable though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: X and lead trumps|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Anyone for a double of 4@H at MP?|pg||
nt|jtr: Might be necessary|pg||
nt|jtr: If we make 3@s|pg||
nt|xenya: but not that UNfriendly, surely|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H = 10-13, 2NT asking - 3@C = minimum, 3@D asking for singleton, 3Nt = singleton @S|pg||
nt|tez: 4@c pls|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S X making, so 5@CX only cost 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|hawe45:  At this level no problem|pg||
nt|sybarra: (not being picky sorry)|pg||
nt|hlortz: that IMP on 21 is suspect even it looked like 660 to me tho maybe not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like 2@C may be  18-19 bal   [same as EW 2@D opener]|pg||
nt|po-s: is double penalty?|pg||
nt|loganrun: weak raise in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You'll get 200 here, though|pg||
nt|sybarra: although on k of @S lead,  anything over 4 is unattrative |pg||
nt|po-s: is this a hand that wants ruffs or to tap declarer?|pg||
nt|po-s: tap apparently|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South does his best|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has a lot of losers....maybe better to pass if you like your offensive chances, inviting pd to bid 5S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: still, at least 11 spades and not much defense. when in doubt bid one more|pg||
nt|shevek: he wasn't keen to be declarer|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2D forcing to suit agreement|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone translate this?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OK, nowthere are 14@C between WEst & North|pg||
nt|tejjyid: he has to bid 2@D|pg||
nt|po-s: it actually looks like Madala opened 1NT on the previous hand |pg||
nt|shevek: 4@s good contract as the cards lie|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 6@S can be made by south|pg||
mb|4C|nt|peachy: ok, maybe S should have opened, this is madness|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W would probably have liked to show spade values, but hard to do that without concealinbg the heart support, and there is likely to be no convenient time later to show support|pg||
nt|marlowepi: making|pg||
nt|marlowepi: clubs ruff up for 3 discards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now W will REALLYYYYYYYY wish he had shown spade values:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she, sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3 spades, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds, 2 clubs    at least|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he would be happy with four - that would mean his opponents could make 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: as indeed they can - may have stolen the pot here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  looks like 300|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - behind the suit|pg||
nt|loganrun: after partner doubled for takeout - sure|pg||
nt|po-s: not on this particular one...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: only by guesswork|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that isn;t an overbid - but some like to have a 2-way pre-empt-y 3@D bid here|pg||
nt|peachy: could still make, despite best lead and all that|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  3 diamonds possible|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And probably only 1 club|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Discarding the @D 8 more or less denies the position of the King|pg||
nt|peachy: probably best to go after clubs, need some of them any way|pg||
nt|peachy: I mean first|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I vote for a small @D now!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The tables are not linked I'm afraid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 630 is the score on 7 in the open room|pg||
nt|xenya: this can be beaten |pg||
nt|xenya: with careful defence|pg||
nt|peachy: three unescapable losers, will be a ppush|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not so easy to defend - @D-ruffs etc.|pg||
nt|po-s: but West will overruff hearts or clubs very soon|pg||
nt|loganrun: and south has trouble getting back to hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Anyway, this gave noting away, the @H-finesse South can handle himself|pg||
nt|po-s: he will probably try the CQ which holds, then what?|pg||
nt|po-s: all this one needs is two finesses|pg||
nt|shevek: losing a@s, a @d and a @c|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jtr: Not 500?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not if they don't double|pg||
nt|jtr: oh right  i see|pg||
nt|hlortz: i'd rather bid 3@H the 1st round. - no not a splinter :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think this N-S pair plays weak jump shifts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@H seems a bit of a punt with a queen-high hand|pg||
nt|tez: wrang i m here ..trust me pls:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like 11 tricks to me too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6 trumps, 2 ruffs, 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after the hand, N will tell S he should have had the 7 of clubs in place of the 6|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I guess so, in fact|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if you tap him off, he gets 8 tricks by position|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: and, lo and behold, the auction proceeded smoothly (in both rooms)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another NT-bid without a sure stopper...|pg||
nt|po-s: good sacrifice against 120|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: play a @d maybe?|pg||
nt|peachy: i think you are right|pg||
nt|shevek: east can't get in|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: almost same auction other room,  but instead of 2 nt, E bid 2 sp |pg||
nt|loganrun: Jack of diamonds works best|pg||
nt|po-s: maybe a diamond directly, but sometimes West has the CA|pg||
nt|loganrun: great card|pg||
nt|shevek: for different reasons neither west nor east can play trumps :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East has by far the best reason|pg||
nt|ritong: strong three suiters often generate weird auctions|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you said it first!|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sfoxa:  @d break will be big disaster for declarer|pg||
nt|po-s: apprximately 2 down?|pg||
nt|xenya: well W dropped a trick when he failed to put up the Q, but that was far from obvious?|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes you told him 7@H he could have just bid 6 LOL|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now no @D-finesse|pg||
nt|flash: low @S a bit surprising?   North would like the 9 to lead the Q, but...|pg||
nt|flash: ah - there was a 1@S call...|pg||
nt|peachy: i was thinking it, maybe I said it|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra2: http://www.bridgeguys.com/pdf/CC/BalickiZmudzinski.pdf   this may help those of you wanting cc|pg||
nt|ritong: i think it even can be said that it is a nightmare for natural systems|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  Any lead 660|pg||
nt|xenya: @SA, 3 clubs and 2 diamonds, including a ruff |pg||
nt|po-s: So East wins and plays a heart, D ruff, Club to ace? and a heart?|pg||
nt|shevek: ouch|pg||
nt|po-s: since undoubled|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told:1@C is their opening bid, 1@D = negative or some stronger, 1@H = either 12-14 bal with better hearts than spades, or one of the stronger versions of 1@C with 4+ hearts, ...|pg||
nt|othered1: not enough ... |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The wrong singleton for a start one could say|pg||
nt|ahollan1: mistiming let's @HT score?|pg||
nt|jcwla: The non-competitive auctions continue.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm not taking the credit - there is an army of spectators who are better declarers than I|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hlortz: well weak jump shifts would realte to 2@H  3@H either weak or a splinter|pg||
nt|xenya: S was naturally hoping for a club honour when he bid 3N -- that was not to be|pg||
nt|shevek: hmmmm|pg||
nt|hawe45:  670 os their way|pg||
nt|othered1: to force to game|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hawe45:  West is forced to play @C - and South will make his living by establishing the 5th @D|pg||
nt|po-s: and in the other room West bid 1H making one finesse ok|pg||
nt|xenya: could be same 2 off on this lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @c10 instead of @c9....|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: one spade and two clubs would be different|pg||
nt|hlortz: /relate/|pg||
nt|gracelin: Nie had conquered the world of  "Go" some 20 years ago and turned his interest to bridge in recent years.|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, u r right, four|pg||
nt|shevek: why so keen? to play @h?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  For no reason|pg||
nt|po-s: aces should mostly be ducked - a lesson which has not yet reached my country|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But here only 600|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Cancel, too early here|pg||
nt|peachy: he can still take 9|pg||
nt|peachy: or more if def allows :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So in fact it was a good lead, leading the @S King, and West takes 11 tricks - here only 9|pg||
nt|peachy: same lead in OR, that ALONE tells me it was a good lead, plus, I would have led Q or 10 = further evidence...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N plays a third spoade and throws a D, so can W, and E plays a fourth spade|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not 100% inescapable. but the defense is easy enough|pg||
nt|roswolf: chance for 1 imp for lavazza|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|othered1: x probably T/O then zmudzinski showed his additional stregth and spade fit|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next door 4@s made when defence offered @c trick to declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: slightly surprised that South, who had a maximum for his initial pass, did not take some action when a weak no trump came back|pg||
nt|flash: we might gain by noticing that the players at this level aren't afraid to pause and consider their play(s)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: unlikely Goef|pg||
pc|h3|nt|peachy: or that in Strong Club context, he didnt open|pg||
nt|flash: we might gain even more by noticing when they pause|pg||
pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: so you will be in Reno next month?|pg||
nt|xenya: a club honour in the N hand that is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or K & Q to fall singleton |pg||
nt|jcwla: So a boring 1-IMP hand. :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chick: probably private, too :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Well,that's what they have, so it's plausible that's what the auction means|pg||
nt|tejjyid: unlikeNS EW have been playing together long enough toknow their system |pg||
nt|ritong: zmud s problem is " can i cater with @sKJxx with north"  if the answer is yes, he will play the 10|pg||
nt|ritong: if the answer is no, well..|pg||
nt|sybarra2: but is N coming in with kjxx of spade  |pg||
nt|ritong: good point shirley|pg||
nt|tejjyid: West may not play North for 8 @C|pg||
nt|sybarra2: have operated for e/w several times. they take a long time then play very fast at end |pg||
nt|sybarra2: or call a card and explain play, show hands and every one puts cards back in box |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|peachy: well, justice served, in a sense|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry provate|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps an endplay in diamonds?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does @CK transfer threat for a squeeze?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it seems to me that either way W gets an overruff. maybe i am missing something|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, not much chance to catch up if the cards dont cooperate by giving some options|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so now the handdemonstrates why lowlevel penalty X's vanished from the game|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gracelin: Thanks for the trainingin "Go", he is a very good card plaer in bridge, but his biddng is a bit old fashioned.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|flash: @C2 is UDA - encouraging|pg||
nt|peachy: where could he get rid of them?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've seen some New Zealand and Australian pairs using this 2@C opener -- but don't recall ever seeing it from an ACBL representative|pg||
pc|s5|nt|tez: no|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|hawe45:  End-plys possible|pg||
nt|hawe45:  play|pg||
nt|peachy: The open room had some conn probs in earlier matches|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H Ace, @C KIng, @H back and the @D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South knowa WeatÂ´s distribution|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And doesÂ´nt matter, whether West has single og double @H from the beginning|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But badly enough, the @C Jack comes down, which means 10 tricks without this endplay|pg||
nt|sybarra: so he overkilled |pg||
nt|tez: no=undo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for Total Trick fans -- this hand is off by 2!  [22 trump but each side can only make 10 tricks]|pg||
nt|tejjyid: every bridge hand demosntrates something :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: note that NS are lucky in that S has the @S8|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hawe45:  Strange @H-shift anyway|pg||
mc|11|nt|jcwla: Lavazza has now bid to slam on 22 -- off two top tricks -- so the rout continues.|pg||
nt|shevek: claim 11|pg||
pg||

mb|3N|nt|brgpro: better N can bid 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: And the defence will be interesting|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brgpro: with Qxx or Kxx it is always better that pd can play the NT hand|pg||
nt|jtr: Or might he lead a @d?|pg||
nt|brgpro: @s lead then( assume N will duck) then @d switch|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bjacobs: Perhaps North goes in queen|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not so easy to spot that a diamond is better than a heart|pg||
nt|bjacobs: After all, he absolutely needs East to have both red aces to have any chance|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This might tempt West to continuing spades|pg||
nt|jtr: I think not|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nor do I, but I feel @SQ was the right play|pg||
nt|brgpro: he is thinking of a red switch now|pg||
nt|jtr: Sure|pg||
nt|brgpro: i believe|pg||
nt|jtr: Can @hs work?|pg||
nt|jtr: Partner could have 6 i guess|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hard to see, as he has no re-entry for a second heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But a heart does not look right either, does it? Axxxx or Kxxxx would not be good enough|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So, Vulcan logic suggests that the diamond is the theoretically correct switch|pg||

mc|8|nt|Walddk2: They would probably lead a diamond, though|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sure they would.  They would have "led up to weakness"|pg||

nt|ahollan1: it couldn't cost to cash that last trump :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like that should be -300|pg||
nt|loganrun: Jack of diamonds was a great card but not as good as what happened|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe it was an element of surprise for west |pg||
nt|hawe45:  West was too fast, East could hardly have a double with only small @D|pg||
nt|loganrun: for surprise - he took awhile to play the ace|pg||
nt|po-s: kids is nice - Johan just turned 50|pg||
nt|marlowepi: suppose W wins lead in hand and leads club|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Netherlands will double their lead, rare against this team|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Move to board 9 - this one looks flat|pg||
nt|xenya: i suggest we watch it -- just in case|pg||
nt|po-s: Right Hans, Lavazza only lost two matches of the qualifying 12|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK ready for board 8 then|pg||
nt|shevek: no @h lead against 3NT ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok probably not enough entries to ruff 2 clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: if a trump lead|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|sfoxa:  lot of spades by NS, but 9 tricks only|pg||
nt|bbramley: hello everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra: is this a funky multi?  |pg||
nt|xenya: looks like N bid 2@D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He must have made the end/play / South should have led the small @S...|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i think North was squeezed out of his @S winners and thrown in for the 12th trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: multi|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: multi|pg||
mb|d!|nt|Walddk2: This could be trouble for N-S|pg||
nt|peachy: a lucky 12 tricks here, but we'll see|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I see - 1NT was 14-16, which explains why it bought the hand on the previous deal|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you know the players in OR P-O?|pg||
nt|po-s: Pass???|pg||
nt|po-s: in slam you might |pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl - a 11-15 bal hand or very strong|pg||
mb|2H|an|p/c|nt|hlortz: hi Bart|pg||
nt|tez: hi Bart:)|pg||
nt|pelu: NS in OR also missed 3NT in board 4 - so the standing is 3-33!|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 very exciting pais here Kit,  however  because of crashes rooms not connected,  Peter has running score |pg||
nt|bbramley: can zmud bid 1NT here to show 4@S and minor?|pg||
nt|flash: halfway through the match - close and entertaining|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually 4+  unless exactly 4=4=3=2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would pass over 1 @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: can not find on cc |pg||
nt|marlowepi: sounds like a dance shirley|pg||
nt|xenya: or 3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT looks not much different from 6 clubs|pg||
nt|shevek: I'm sure the @d finesse would have helped anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: duboin can only bid 3NT i guess|pg||
nt|tejjyid: likely to be flat, anyway, OR going down in 5@D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: excellent 3@H preempt|pg||
nt|tejjyid: spiteful|pg||
nt|ritong: but he visibly wonders about that|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and if South bids 3 nt...|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what will west lead ?|pg||
nt|po-s: I would bid 2S with the East hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: i might pass as east showing diamonds|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: that wd have got the lead right |pg||
mb|d|nt|tez: negative free bid working here|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: is that raptor? |pg||

nt|ahollan1: top 8 teams qualify for tomorrow's quarter final|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: oh oh   |pg||

nt|tejjyid: no mucking around with the N cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: has a good hand.....|pg||
nt|tejjyid: How cn SOuth resist kicking now?|pg||
nt|othered1: Plenty of room in a passed hand for what you need for slam.|pg||
nt|ritong: oh, he can|pg||
nt|ritong: assuming @h ace is out, and it surely is, the five level is not safe|pg||
mb|3C|nt|hawe45:  They might be there after board 7 - but we need OR-result|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No, they lost 1 IMP|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am sure you have played agst them |pg||
nt|xenya: 2@D? -- major + minor?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well lookee here|pg||
nt|po-s: weird if multi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H would have been Double Negative|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Saved |pg||
nt|peachy: I guess they will get to this slam now, E showing shape I assume|pg||
nt|flash: how light does one open in 3rd chair?   the more lead-directional the call, the lighter it might be???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=one-round force|pg||
nt|chick: a clear violation of Burn's Law|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone else prefer to pass 1@S?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: really?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and lots of others too I suspect|pg||
nt|vugraphzcj: Sorry,last 3 trick is C. N lead.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good pass by Madala downgrading his soft values|pg||
nt|roswolf: certainly i would do so if the multi could be based on a 5 card major as often happens|pg||
nt|shevek: some value dbl by south, followed by 3@c, better hand than bidding 3@c over 2@h|pg||
nt|roswolf: north shouls respect pards decision|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  lots of rescuing done today|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S absolutely needed trumps 22 because one club had to be ruffed to set up the suit, and later a spade had to be ruffed. if Ds are 3-1 the hand cant make|pg||
nt|peachy: but don't know|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pass would be eminently sensible|pg||
nt|chick: no, but I prefer to bid 2@D over 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would prefer 1N if semi-force or non-force|pg||
nt|jcwla: E did not switch to @S when in with @HA -- all went bye bye on the @D's -- 11 to Lavazza on 22|pg||
nt|hlortz: odd looking to me west dbls stiff in unbid suit  east with k 5th doesnt bid them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe it shows a near-opening in one major|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: little did wwest know a spade preference was coming on his left|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 8:  N  3NT-1 in the OR|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, Roland said earlier was made with +1 bd7|pg||
nt|sybarra: sometimes pard bids 2 @D,  if not I will |pg||
nt|sybarra: (over 2 @C)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly -- you just don't know what hand partner holds for 2@C when 1N is absolute force|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, should have been -300 -- unless W didn't play 2 rounds of hearts at the end|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hans -- is your plan to PASS reopening DBL?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No the 1 NT, which should mean, that I was too week for 1 NT directly |pg||
nt|shevek: guesses for the lead?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if 3Nt shows spade stop then maybe on way to 6C|pg||
nt|odysseus69: difficult for North to find killing lead if they do get there|pg||
nt|shevek: it's not south who is thinking|pg||
nt|shevek: the operator has to enter both bids in the same time|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the fact that East did not bid 3NT over 3C but stopped off to show heart ace is the key|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, really|pg||
nt|othered1: 4N natural or asking?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: partner has the filthiest 4@S bid u can imagine and slam is still playable|pg||
nt|ritong: partner can have any blank 6/5|pg||
nt|ritong: or so|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well, the 5 level would stlll be safe|pg||
nt|ritong: more or less:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but not for me - need the @H 10 as well|pg||
nt|peachy: with a slightly different layout they dont have game and we go for 500|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I assume 2@H shows @S|pg||
nt|jcwla: As long as you can be sure they'll transfer so you're on lead anyway...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and 3@H is soem  kind of Choice of Games - now South wondering if he has done enough|pg||
nt|peachy: dubious pleasure thin hand at least|pg||
nt|peachy: in this hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrth can't be much worse though & they are 50 imps down|pg||
nt|tejjyid: plus, jsut made a slam missing 2 Aces; you don;twant to waste a lucky set!|pg||
nt|peachy: all this head spinning strategy|pg||
nt|tejjyid: SJ SImon said when you had evidence you werelucky you should push harder|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think 5@C now isOK, but can North cooperate?|pg||
nt|peachy: rubber, but perhaps still valid in duplicate|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Maybe the @D are solid enough for himto show the K? It's very hard; the 6th @S makes so much difference, but the guy who has itcan't see the AK or J|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: doubling 2@H is an option|pg||
nt|chick: yes, raija, and it kept them out of a very good (but unfortunately unmakeable) slam|pg||
nt|xenya: on 22, EW in the OR did bid and make 3N on basically the same defence: @H lead ducked by N|pg||
nt|po-s: how about "Polish"?|pg||
nt|bbramley: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E apparently assumed N had announced 4 spades so the double would be more for clubs and hearts. not condoning that line of thought just attempting to explain|pg||
nt|hlortz: unless 2@H was xfer to @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: no chance, without def erring|pg||
nt|tez: i m chicken..i have no idea for convention names|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello po, you are always welcome :)|pg||
nt|tez: hi PO|pg||
nt|othered1: which brings us back to playing the other 6+card fit a level lower :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that would make it hard to play 2H, the single most likely correct contract when W doubles|pg||
nt|othered1: IN OR, Nunes bid a calm 3N over 3@H.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: All too hard, thinks South|pg||
nt|shevek: he did|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm north punts|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  any reason for West to bid immediately?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He feared a pass by North who could well have had a heart fit|pg||
nt|hawe45:  then|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with 2M being the bad weak 2|pg||
nt|larrymori: maybe more like 10(good 9) to 13|pg||
nt|po-s: so the actually play Ekeblad|pg||
nt|larrymori: seems logical|pg||
nt|marlowepi: more like Inkblot|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you see what you want to see:)|pg||
nt|larrymori: 5M and 4+ m|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of a "reverse" muiderberg|pg||
nt|po-s: some of us might even jump to game with East hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: bidding the minor |pg||
nt|larrymori: except he had @ss so he probably went low|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very soft shape for a game bid. since you have already started with a preempt & gotten by N, you can make the accurate valuation bid of 3H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: another wrong side|pg||
nt|po-s: he always does|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jbgood: still - with no club fit..|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let's wait - errare humanum est|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html  tourney site |pg||
nt|flash: still a long way to go for N-S to reach game after this start?   (the balancing X certainly helped)|pg||
nt|po-s: interesting lead here|pg||
nt|loganrun: This has no chance even on a non club lead as long as West is still not thinking about the last hand|pg||
nt|po-s: if a spade, three rounds of diamonds, ruffed overruffed, and a heart|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hlortz: this will make with a good view in @H suit i guess|pg||
nt|po-s: thanks - it is bedtime but I must see my expartner overbid - alittle|pg||
nt|peachy: i am betting on diam lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think the Italian pairs often use DBL in mid auction to just say  extra points|pg||
nt|loganrun: the 6 and 7 of hearts come into play|pg||
nt|shevek: ok kids, against suit contracts we lead shortage |pg||
nt|shevek: oops|pg||
nt|shevek: 5@c might make an overtrick for a loss of 1 imp|pg||
nt|odysseus69: much better thn 3NT|pg||
nt|shevek: agree, no justice|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: holding four bad hearts i would incline to pass. game is unlikely and i have some defense. if pd bids after i pass, i will be very well placed to act, but if i bid 1N, i will have ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to stop bidding before i have much usefuyl info|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting situation for Klinger if Apteker does Pass 1@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all that from a guy who has to blow the dust off the green card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SA then ruffing finesse might hold this to down 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh my |pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe 4N wasn't asking, else how could north go?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: gee, he wanted more than one Ace? How was his partner to know when to go on?|pg||
nt|ritong: situation is not improving for NS|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I guess 6@S is no worse than 3NT, with more upside|pg||
nt|roswolf: std play to neutraluse the spade suit|pg||
nt|shevek: has to switch to @d|pg||
nt|shevek: Madala did , I'm told|pg||
nt|roswolf: nothing else seems attractive|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: and which one is ex?|pg||
nt|sybarra: (sorry I do not know) |pg||
nt|hlortz: needs a deep finesse here :)|pg||
nt|bbramley: i don't think he can make it even with a perfect guess - more clubs will sink it|pg||
nt|tez: many thanks all..here 4.09 am..bye all..see you..enjoyed|pg||
nt|hlortz: really?n follow to 3 @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Tez @H  pleasant dreams |pg||
nt|bbramley: i see, henry, so he'll threaten to dump both spades - yes, that would be PERFECT guessing|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL at the end of the day this could be a pick up |pg||
nt|ritong: they might go slowly to the score comparison|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sfoxa:  we have comfortable sitting at home, with coffee and double-dummy deals, not so they|pg||
nt|peachy: indeed, pressure of a big event|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South must be declarer at this board, we might see an NL-score  now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North got a diamond lead in the other room|pg||
nt|hlortz: lol yes the deep 7|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|pelu: also in 4@H in OR - but here the lead: a small @S from S?????????????????|pg||
nt|hlortz: oops|pg||
nt|peachy: N did well to show his max, assumedly Dbl meant it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but don't quote me on that|pg||
nt|po-s: interesting bidding - most pairs promise another bid after a cue (unpassed hand)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|xenya: 10 imps|pg||
nt|pelu: to K|pg||
nt|sybarra: I said "ugh"  and would you believe there is spec with that bbo name? |pg||
nt|flash: if South, holding KJx, wouldn't bid NT, that was no longer a possible/plausible strain|pg||
nt|peachy: OR overcalled 1NT with S hand, no wonder they got to game|pg||
nt|hlortz: well unless 2@D xfer not making the case for it im just confused :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wel sure, but the question is why E ddnt bid spades. of course it shows extras|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West surely counted on a @C-.suit in East|pg||
nt|po-s: If you guys don´t stop I´ll leave and go back to bed - but I guess that would please yoy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D 2 told me something|pg||
nt|larrymori: without them got to jack it up but might get the transfer 4@s bid|pg||
nt|po-s: moment of truth|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You canÂ´nt go wrong|pg||
nt|xenya: how about 3N EW (suggested by a spectator)?|pg||
nt|tez: hi all|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and world-wide watching |pg||
nt|ahollan1: now lead any minor for down 2  -- even @DJ works -- ruff, @HA  @D ruff @C uppercut to re-establish @C10|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they bid 2D a;ready|pg||
nt|sybarra: I bet 3 @H was pass or correct|pg||
nt|shevek: now might make|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|h3|nt|peachy: so it could be a dblwhammy for them, dbld game and a plus unmaking slam.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ah -- yes i can live with that tactic|pg||
nt|larrymori: i will bet lol|pg||
nt|shevek: @ss were dead....|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hlortz: oops my bad lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is a cnfusing auction:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: see i *said* i was confused.. meanwhile 3@C not a thing of beauty|pg||
nt|jcwla: As Raija predicted 23 a push so 35-12 at the halfway mark.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no but he has an awfully good hand and i dont see a better call for him if he is going to bid again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe it helps to know that both of the round kings are offside :)|pg||
nt|xenya: this inelegant contract might make...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: ,yes, via Rome perhaps|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hawe45:  But even on a @D-lead from East, you should have 10 tricks|pg||
nt|po-s: must be a commentator|pg||
nt|peachy: lost that one|pg||
nt|shevek: he was thinking abt @ds chris :)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i guess that works too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The @h shift is rather clear|pg||
nt|ritong: hey tez:) welcome|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|Walddk4: Won @DK at trick 2, advanced @CQ and got clubs wrong later, playing for the double finesse|pg||
nt|peachy: Merijn home here, fortuitous rightsiding|pg||
nt|po-s: hmm, overruff and a heart would make it more difficult for West|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|peachy: in a dition to different club play then|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 10 IMPs to NL|pg||
nt|bbramley: that will simplify the defense - if he hadn't cashed @SA it gets complicated|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with 4-4 in majors on S odds are good for a @d Hx on S|pg||
nt|hlortz: lavazza lucky on bd 22 or it would be lots to not much|pg||
nt|po-s: I think the SJ could never be right|pg||
nt|roswolf: building his 9 th trick|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
mc|9|nt|Walddk2: Not sure how much -150 is worth|pg||

mb|p|nt|brgpro: 3@d is my guess|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@D=5-11 HCP  5/6@D|pg||

nt|po-s: True - as Nicoleta points out Balickis lead against 3NT could have been from a 3card suit. perhaps change leads in partner´s bid suit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: even a spade lead does not defeat 4H|pg||

mb|3H!|nt|dburn: chance for North-South to retaliate by reaching a lucky slam of their own - 6@c and 6NT both make if played by North (who has bid clubs)|pg||

nt|hawe45:  In 4 @H you get 12 tricks - in 6 6 @H only 10|pg||
nt|flash: these stopperless NT calls are frightening!!!|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and N/S making it tough for them to get there|pg||
nt|shevek: 5-4 minors and 3@h thx specs|pg||
mb|4D|nt|marlowepi: i dont|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Defeating this 4 @H will bring NL in front|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think the real score is 10-17|pg||
nt|hlortz: some sort of science in action here|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 controls I am told|pg||
nt|hawe45:  When 2 @D is majors, I would lead @S King|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No success this time though|pg||
nt|po-s: Was South really contemplating anything but Pass or  was Sylvan really thinking?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You  are welcome - in 3 @S|pg||
nt|shevek: thx PO :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Geoff Breskal won the Gold Cup many years ago|pg||
nt|Walddk2: many many years ago|pg||
nt|hlortz: indelicate but effective|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe David Edwin in the audience remembers when|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this event is well-known for collecting "names" in Yokohama, the organizers do their best to attract "stars" giving national players fine possibility to compete  |pg||
nt|hawe45:  But no good lead for South|pg||
nt|peachy: Have to stay away from spade lead to have any chance|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best he could do|pg||
nt|dburn: sorry - 6@c, as a spectator points out, will not make if East leads her diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think 3S is fine. you have an AK and you are nonvul. most of the time S has 6 spades. even if 5 no great harm shd come to you|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not the best spot:)|pg||
nt|tez: dbl=good @h's|pg||
nt|tez: zmud and balicky are globally reknowned particularly by their defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: a case for cashing the ace - not done|pg||
nt|bbramley: looks that way, and 2@D looks like an artif GF, or maybe this range balanced|pg||
nt|po-s: perfect bridge|pg||
nt|sybarra: jxx didnt feel like stopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: this is more a lucky one than the 6NT was, there he only needed spade finess|pg||
nt|gracelin: I was in Yokohama for the NEC cup last year.  This Latin team did very well but they are missing Diego this time.|pg||
nt|dburn: all academic - they aren't going to bid a slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after 3 Ds need heart shift|pg||
nt|peachy: this at least one down|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South could double for the lead|pg||
nt|shevek: I guess was the screen |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well done Fantoni|pg||
nt|po-s: but as usual Sementa overbids|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk4: Unfortunately our operators do not speak English, so I can't explain how to reconnect after a crash|pg||
nt|peachy: Maybe there is a bilingual specctator to help Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's all in our manual, but that's also in English|pg||
nt|gracelin: they soudn't.  This is amuch worse slam than last board which only needs a finesse.|pg||
nt|peachy: is Diego B in another team or not there this year?|pg||
nt|po-s: and isn´t|pg||
nt|sybarra: nope! |pg||
nt|odysseus69: the lucky 3NT was not a realistic spot|pg||
nt|shevek: will make 11 tricks for a flat board|pg||
nt|roswolf: east not doubling should ensure this is defeated|pg||
nt|shevek: a lot of bidding to a non making part score|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: this might be tricky both for declarer and  defenders|pg||
nt|po-s: that HQ is a good card, otherwise declarer might have  difficulties|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This one should depend om finding the @S Queen|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we think 2 @D= 18+ |pg||
nt|pelu: they play tranfer-ans on 1@C - so 1@S sh be a normal 1NT|pg||
nt|hlortz: hmm little conservative with 25 hcp total|pg||
nt|hlortz: but i guess they are high enough|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a danger that S will take a phantom though|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best spot for N/S then|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sybarra: not an easy hand to play is it?|pg||
nt|gracelin: tk he is not cming thisyear.|pg||
nt|flash: semi-sensible lead for a push...|pg||
nt|shevek: the operator has to wait for both bids|pg||
nt|shevek: keyboards can be quite noisy :)|pg||
nt|po-s: stiff king might have been though|pg||
nt|shevek: agree with that|pg||
nt|tez: agree?|pg||
nt|ritong: oh yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree |pg||
nt|jcwla: Interesting sequence here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzcj: sorry i may have missed the bidding but the final contract is 3NT:)|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you operator|pg||
nt|tejjyid: can you squeeze South if you douck a @D sometime? & set the @H up?|pg||
nt|po-s: worse done unes|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: oops|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|loganrun: 2H seems straightforward but 4H has some obstacles in the play|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The board Lavazza has waited for|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: 2H is just begging for EW to bid the vul game and make it by finessing partner for H queen which they would not otherwise do|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps he was thinking of sac in those colors?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not every lead kills this 4 @H - but IÂ´m sure, the @C Ace did|pg||
nt|peachy: seems this is now going set, straining my eyes for way to make, but no|pg||
nt|peachy: Teramoto is a great player but not the miracleman|pg||
nt|bbramley: plenty high - even with a moderately friendly lie i don't think he'll make it|pg||
nt|pelu: in 4@H Nunes played @H to 8 and A in trick 2!|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, it wasn't easy i guess |pg||
nt|ritong: poor giorgio|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the premptive bidding by Bochi worked|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: not sure when   late 70's    early 80's I believe|pg||
nt|xenya: imaginative shift that turns out to be good|pg||
nt|xenya: well at least it was safe|pg||
nt|peachy: maybe two if def really alert|pg||
nt|larrymori: east had to bid 3nt to give a chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: low from doubleton,  ... |pg||
nt|ritong: after all their problems, now in a zero % spot|pg||
nt|sybarra: or singleton  (just joking)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: @D might be 4-2 with the H, and @S manageable|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think it's about .5%|pg||
nt|ritong: probably a push, though  but no sun ray|pg||
nt|tejjyid: @C swich now awkward|pg||
nt|tez: @h q easy and right|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: vine X si acu tu cu 5-5 zici 4@s si eu o sa ma duc ...|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: sorry|pg||
nt|tez: he has @d entry..bal|pg||
nt|tez: bal means balicki..not balance:)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|shevek: swap the red kings :)|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm gonna ask GIB|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not ifthey lead@C, anywa|pg||
nt|tejjyid: can you programGIB to misdefend a little?|pg||
nt|peachy: our BF GIB says not making, but that is ofcourse dbldummy|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: another of quite a few slams missing 2 Aces|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East might think, that South is in position to get a @C-ruff - not North. He must play @H Ace and another @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no -- this could have been dead minimum 2@H  [5+@H, 10+ HCP]|pg||
nt|po-s: not making??|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: Hi David|pg||
nt|flash: i'm getting some coaching in the 'modern' game - distribution first; stoppers later...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, minimum, but not dead minimum. the suit is good, and there is a residual fit for E, and the hand has 2 aces|pg||
nt|marlowepi: EW probably have H stop in practice if W is dummy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A @D is OK|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: still could be achieved i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- i would expect Honor doubleton or better for 3@S|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: with 3 1/2 defensive tricks??|pg||
nt|sybarra: might have been with E playing, |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Stay with us, you are on soon anyway|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|ady: ok|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6N+1 52/58|pg||
nt|gracelin: Seems EW use a similar scheme like CAPP against opponent strong club opening.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The stopperless NT is called practical bidding. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but giving up over 2@C is a mystery -- that appears to be the winning approach|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: one pair made 7N by South|pg||
nt|ady: bet possible for n/s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1977 it was. Thanks to Jeffrey Allerton|pg||
nt|hawe45:  13 tricks, I suppose|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps S has a count now -- from the bidding and N's discards, so he may well return a @D -- no...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what is best now? @c, trumph or @d against the triple void?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D would have been best - but very soon we shall see declarer check, if @S are 3-3|pg||
nt|po-s: he knows partner has five spades and from his discards nothing in hearts|pg||
nt|peachy: I cant even program a VCR....|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: but no denying their in great spot|pg||
pc|h9|nt|flash: something about old dogs and new water dishes...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually @SK is still interesting -- would Klinger duck to preserve entry to dummy?|pg||
nt|tez: @c is right now|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the@C switch is too good|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|peachy: might as well have used the HK, what else to do with it?|pg||
nt|peachy: toss it under the ace?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He will do next time|pg||
nt|pelu: but still down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they're|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: but it could be our hand and it might be strategically crucial to let him now over 3H that this is an above-average dummy for spades as weak D openers go|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it would be possible to use double by the weak 2 bidder for a hand like this, so that 3S can show better spades and/or a somewhat higher offense-to-defense ratio|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Apteker will get this right -- 3@H bid needs shortness somewhere because of limited HCP|pg||
nt|marlowepi: realistically it is not likely that N willl want to use double of 3H for penalty purposes after opening a weak 2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: why a club shift? and if that is what E asked for, why did he?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think my copy of CC says 1st discard is upside-down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart would seem marked from both sides of table|pg||
pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: i agree, with everyone bidding so much W is likely to be short in spades|pg||
nt|ritong: wow|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after all if he were short elsewhere he might have led that suit at trick 3|pg||
nt|po-s: looks like 2 diamond losers and aheart - rest is crossruffs|pg||
nt|shevek: ok, I'll take it all back|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bbramley: i like his line of play: he needed 1 of 2 club finesses through south, plus the spade finesse|pg||
nt|po-s: really? spade to king?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  From the bidding East has been warned|pg||
nt|xenya: yes -- also likely 4 hearts, so E has a singleton club|pg||
nt|xenya: and has nothing to pitch|pg||
nt|po-s: he could try a club from dummy in case opps don´t notice he is in his hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and S will discard @cJ on next @h|pg||
nt|ritong: impressive|pg||
nt|tez: it is not a shame to think while defending|pg||
nt|tejjyid: @C is clear I think; Parnehas @D length|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d3|nt|sfoxa:  I bet - that is a push :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if wins @SA gets extra @S trick, but cannot establish @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too much drama -- after small @D I thought he'd already made up his mind :)|pg||
nt|tez: sybarra said same yesterday.right?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: EW make some diamonds|pg||
nt|po-s: 3 more it seems|pg||
pc|c4|nt|peachy: 4 more tricks for declarer, 1 down|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and 11 IMPs to NL   21-17|pg||
nt|ralfwil: bad discard!|pg||
pc|cT|nt|po-s: sorry still on previous|pg||
nt|bbramley: whoa, didn't someone bid 3NT?  i must have been seeing things|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes i thought you must have :)|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: and well done by S|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hawe45:  The minor-squeeze|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@h= at least 5-4 minor inv (nothing abt Maj) I'm told|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|peachy: he must have been thinking SOMEthing, cuz I agree it was silly to pinpoint the H singleton|pg||

nt|brgpro: 4@c looks too much to me|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I agree with mini-splinter, but many don't play that|pg||

nt|brgpro: rather creative...|pg||

nt|roswolf: this looks a boring hand and a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: meanwhile, I think E should have tried for game by bidding 2NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: that's a Precision 1D opening.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will probably go to the 5 level|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mdgraham: something seems to have happened to the website - board scores disconnected|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 33 spades let it thru though|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  20-20 points and @c vs @h|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N by N a favorite to make:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are EW playing Precision?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can handle 5-1 spade break - north needed a 4th club or the diamond king -|pg||
nt|ritong: oy|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but it doesn;t seem to affect his game|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i predict 5@S 1 or 2 down|pg||

nt|peachy: identical auction so far as in OR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this DBL gets more votes :)     |pg||
nt|ritong: oy oy oy|pg||
mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: very likely that 3N makes but 4H does not (or that both do)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm sure notes talk about Matt's DBL - but i won't be able to find it in time :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmm|pg||
nt|tez: weak notrump opening..very hard for openents|pg||
nt|po-s: for future excitement let us hope  5H making or 6S doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: X by E should show extras, convertible vcalyues|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another slam|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This slam is better |pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think Klinger would duck the @SK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H-P-3@S???|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|chick: I dunno about that, E had only one club stopper|pg||
nt|bbramley: polish club, usually a weak nt, but sometimes...  18+ HCP|pg||
nt|hlortz: singleton kings here one on one off|pg||
nt|sybarra: with his rabbi,  N  or S can make game in either red suit |pg||
nt|peachy: nice safe contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: needs a heart lead to beat 3nt if e/w gets ther|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  could be too high (if NS find @h ruff) |pg||

nt|tez: i dont agree with pass S hand|pg||
nt|ritong: he s inhibited|pg||
mb|4D|nt|peachy: nice fillers and suit in dummy|pg||
nt|flash: only 21 HCP - and the opps are bidding...   |pg||
nt|peachy: but not any more|pg||
nt|hawe45:  For a 21Â´er, North has a weak hand|pg||
nt|flash: now, i have a preference...   5-card suits are shown?  4-card suits aren't???|pg||
nt|peachy: not when the opp bid it?|pg||
nt|peachy: I think I misunderstood|pg||
nt|flash: now you're teasing?   3@C puts things up a level, but we're not escaping this any more cheaply??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will South rebid 3@S over 3@C or ....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S helps with shape, but without an honor  yuk|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe 4D autosplinter (if ti is)|pg||
nt|peachy: I think S will show his shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe 4@D is minorwood  [RKCB in @C]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still - the key is that south needs to hear about @H filler to really get excited|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer could save a trick by playing another @H, pitching another club -- not clear why he changed the plan|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4H looks more awkward|pg||
nt|po-s: VERY good decision|pg||
nt|po-s: but???|pg||
nt|po-s: that+s what I´m afraid of|pg||
nt|po-s: all he needs is Axxx and an ace (clubs)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: not enogh po... with so much bidding suits will break badly|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Oh, that 5-level again|pg||
nt|pelu: coprrection : Nunes maded 41Hs - correction by operator (misclicks)|pg||
nt|hlortz: yep thought if he played @H to the 7 he'd make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: will e/w get in?|pg||
nt|sybarra: spec points out 4 @S makes |pg||
nt|bbramley: 1@D=artif weak, 1@H=nat but could still be a weak nt (F1?), 2@D nat NF|pg||
nt|bbramley: 3@S makes, lose 1 of each|pg||
nt|sybarra: no doesnt make,  think it loses a trick in each suit,,  |pg||
nt|flash: might North have called 2@H over 1@S, instead of Xing again?   (thnx, Deb)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  When I was young(er), this pass was for playing 2 @D RD|pg||
nt|peachy: i'm having a conversation with two specs, forgive my inattention please|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Otherwise they can make bluff-RD|pg||
nt|flash: only 2?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: even harder if you pass it on the South hand|pg||
nt|tez: you?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: Again, West has the wrong singleton for it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I agree...!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks, kakasi explaining what to do for the operator in Japanese|pg||
nt|kakasi: I[v[ÌÊð\¦·é½ßÅ·B|pg||
nt|hlortz: now 4@H from n?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it seems unlikely that spades will play better than clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, I would, but I am not them :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant say I like Wests double of 1C|pg||
nt|shevek: it's ok if they play ELC|pg||
nt|shevek: that is Equal Level Conversion|pg||
nt|ritong: no, not moi:)|pg||
nt|ritong: heh|pg||
nt|tez: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S is the std contract - but a spec was mussing on how a swing might be generated|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I am strongly against bidding 3S with E hand, it just means that 3rd seat will become too cautious knowing that partner will jack up the bidding to the three level with a balanced ...|pg||
nt|peachy: 9 count and support|pg||
nt|po-s: will East be satisfied with 3NT|pg||
nt|po-s: 4C|pg||
nt|sybarra: right bart, I shouid double check  what spec say :)|pg||
nt|bbramley: balicki finally reveals his true nature|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i hate to splinter with singleton Ace|pg||
nt|po-s: in 5S with a heart lead - but if N doubles they probably stop|pg||
mb|5C|nt|po-s: or 6? no..|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @C looks fine|pg||
nt|po-s: he won´t get much cooperation I think - well maybe 4D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Easte must have been very close to a D|pg||
nt|flash: certainly i expected partner to make this call - if i didn't bid 3@C earlier, i pass and try not to look too ready for the axe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the hard bid to explain is not Matt's double but rather 5H|pg||
nt|chick: wonder why he ran from 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bingo!|pg||
nt|peachy: now P|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont hold up your bingo card yet, they have not IDed a spade control yet|pg||
nt|xenya: i never do|pg||
nt|ralfwil: saved by the bell!!!|pg||
nt|shevek: they are keen...|pg||
nt|po-s: and now he might not lead a heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: there ought to be a law about that|pg||
nt|peachy: the 9 including a dubious Qx on the side|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, after the lead and the favorable DA position.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Apteker may have given the show away with his DBL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would be tickled pink to play 5DX after W volunteered the suit over my X|pg||
nt|chick: but he can't let it go undoubled|pg||
nt|peachy: nowadays, just about everything is a transfer|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I belive S shows a non-minimum 5422|pg||
nt|jcwla: Big opportunity here.|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm getting high|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: of course -- failure to hear a 4@D call probably means some @S values -- but who knows|pg||
nt|loganrun: This is your coffee board Hans|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reliable source says they were playing Precision yesterday -- so probably today too :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  decent logic!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have CC for their teammates who usually play Precision, but decided NOT to do that this tournament|pg||
nt|marlowepi: except that the 4H call doesnt make much sense if EW are playing Precision|pg||
nt|po-s: for me this sequence shows extras|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would be happy to pass 1 NT as Northe|pg||
nt|shevek: oops, 3NT was not part of the equation|pg||
nt|ritong: well, this is common to every bridge players, even the greatest like duboin is|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: 3@d jump fit might have helped|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree PO, but is @cQ extra?|pg||
nt|othered1: Do y ou have a bid for south over 1N?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: You think he has food poisoning?|pg||
nt|sybarra: can I show majors? |pg||
nt|tez: 1 nt was 15 18..specs say|pg||
mb|5S|nt|hlortz: defense wants to make sure declarer has an entry for the @D finesse|pg||
nt|peachy: a little relief here for Zimmermann, match is not yet out of hand by any means|pg||
nt|flash: a sexy 3 IMPs?|pg||
nt|othered1: can anyone translate this auction?|pg||
nt|po-s: the drawback being that we might miss a 44fit in spades (since I would support to 2H directly|pg||
nt|ritong: game is awful, you have a borderline decision to make and coin flips on the wrong side|pg||
nt|po-s: my wish came true |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: another big swing for Lavazza ?|pg||
nt|po-s: now....|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: South pushed well      might have considered doubling with 2 aces |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fit bids are quite good because they help your partner to judge later|pg||
nt|po-s: very difficult to get to 6C|pg||
nt|po-s: unless he uses it toplay trumps...|pg||
nt|po-s: then a small which is wrong if KJ bare|pg||
nt|peachy: dia shift there could have held but partner's suit is normal |pg||
nt|peachy: I think 4H was an offer to play, |pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile Duboin's silence against 1@S-2@S has paid off with 6 more on 25 as Bulgaria's E/W got to 2NT/W-2.  Lavazza to within 11.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and this is why 3@S probably wrong|pg||
nt|po-s: yes Marshall - just a bit trickier|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont show this auction to your novices class:)|pg||
nt|shevek: 12 imps penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: bidding 2N does not rule out getting to 3H|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @S D is "only" 1400, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jan Martel says they were hyperaggressive yesterday too|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's those @S pips I suppose, otherwise it looks pretty minimum to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 4H|pg||
nt|xenya: no matter what W does now, declarer will only lose 2 more trumps |pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is why i like 4D better than 3S--the slam interest is underscored, as opposed to 3S|pg||
nt|sybarra: where are we going? |pg||
nt|peachy: if a kibitzer knows their system, feel free to chirp in here|pg||
nt|roswolf: heart lead looks very possible|pg||
nt|po-s: couldn´t East have the DK?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think so|pg||
nt|roswolf: with me definitely|pg||
nt|po-s: we hope so - trump leads are overrated|pg||
pc|h8|nt|marlowepi: 4S was not a strong effort, i think, N should put S in the picture with some sort of fit-showing club bid|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes then 4@H clearly control bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after 4D-4H, now S can bid 4N=  "i am still interested, but i dont have a spade control"|pg||
nt|peachy: In this auction, I dont think 4H was control, he has to show it at some point|pg||
nt|peachy: but again, I dont have their notes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and another keypoint for partnerships   would 3@C-4@C be forcing?  [key is to be on same page]|pg||
nt|po-s: where is Barry? a lot of relays|pg||
nt|marlowepi: true p-o, thought needed about timing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he is lurking in the wings|pg||
nt|tez: same for me|pg||
nt|roswolf: wd|pg||
nt|po-s: yep!|pg||
nt|shevek: 4@c was a splinter in east's best suit, serves him right|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: she can pitch a @H forcexample|pg||
nt|jcwla: There is grace in ending in 4NT here.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sfoxa:  now it's 5 more imps for NANIWADA|pg||
nt|sybarra: lets see,  auction in normal life ...we can figure out..landing in same spot  with 3 or 4 bids?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but pass after 1nt is rather close when S has something i @c|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes depends on whether west ruffs the 4th @D qith @sq OR NOT ?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|hlortz: 200 52/58 so far|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chick: it was a 16IMP swing on the 6@D fiasco|pg||
nt|po-s: trump ace I guess|pg||
nt|pelu: even then he has an re-entry on @H10 - to take the @D-finess :(|pg||
nt|peachy: wow, OR stayd in partscore|pg||
nt|peachy: a ping-pong match|pg||
nt|jcwla: Already 10 coming to Bulgaria, slam would have been an extra 5.|pg||
nt|tez: i play dbl as minor + 4 major|pg||
nt|peachy: ok, a helpful kib said: their sys is to bid every suit 3 times and then guess the correct contract. I'm not telling who it was:)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|xenya: this could be tricky?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: low club was best chance|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|bbramley: keeping control against spade tap|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - one more cup|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 6@D isn't unreasonable - it has an alibi at least|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: to specs: sorry rooms not connected,  we are trying our best to keep running score |pg||
nt|pelu: ny calculation are 42-6 for Zimmermann - but.......(:(:|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: ah, scores are back.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Healthy lead Sandqvist-McIntosh have|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But much can still happen in an uneven field|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14 boards to go|pg||
nt|mdgraham: any views on 2@S there/|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, this event seems to revolve around how well you kill the less experienced pairs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon it's a bit quacky |pg||
nt|hlortz: i dislike the ambiguity of 2@S limit *or better*|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Being in the right place at the right time|pg||
nt|jtr: That too|pg||
nt|chick: the other table bid 6@D but made it|pg||
nt|bbramley: balicki will wonder why wrang didn't lead his (necessarily) singleton diamond - might drop it for that reason|pg||
nt|othered1: so you plan to give up on one of your majors?|pg||
nt|jcwla: "Now what happened last time I didn't cash my ace?"|pg||
nt|tejjyid: draw trumps, ruffing finesse, go down, tell partners it was 50%|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|flash: i've had a suggestion that X of 2@H might not have been penalties...   the 'modern' game strikes again?  all Xs below 2NT are t/o???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well done|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you could try to dummy revrse, set up @C and find a 12th trick in the end game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lack of an aggressive lead against 6 may suggest to N that E has heart ace and long spades to the king|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that is too hard for me though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry private|pg||
nt|peachy: ok, I give up. checking our BF again|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but a fine dedcution, worthy of yr namesake|pg||
nt|peachy: GIB claims makeable|pg||
nt|tejjyid: sure, easy, jsut take @S finesse|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but theruffing finesse looks a LOT simpler|pg||
nt|marlowepi: win in dummy and start on clubs, later take spade finesse for heart dscard.  if inferences are drawn from trump lead|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, that's plausible on the lead|pg||
nt|peachy: at the other table, S was declarer, with a heart to K and ace, trump back|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|peachy: then it was lucky they DID bid it, the loss would have been significant|pg||
nt|hlortz: better a natural entry to dummy , it looks suspicious if you LET declarer get there|pg||
nt|sybarra: Al Holland in other room had same |pg||
pc|d2|nt|poohbear: arry who?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tejjyid: experts lead trumps against slams rarely|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in all likelihood you are going to have to ruff one club anyway|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|po-s: why the SQ?|pg||
nt|flash: the Open Room auction certainly looks ripe for a penalty X|pg||
nt|flash: (move your cursor over the Open Room result on this screen to see the auction_|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Balicki play it for all its worth|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hlortz: passing 4@C in OR was quite a position....|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looking over these boards, it must be acknowledged that there were a few interesting decisions to be made. but most of these IMPs have slithered one way or the other due to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: essentially unforced errors|pg||
nt|tez: yes give up the one pd does not choose:)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|po-s: shouldn´t he have played another club to indicate he doesn´t know anything abt diamonds|pg||
nt|peachy: I have to agree|pg||
nt|po-s: it seems as if you really could squeeze everything out of East with relays you would bid 3NT|pg||
mc|10|nt|peachy: too bad about the error in decl play, pressure pressure of big event|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It was pretty smart.  I'm not sure how much Fantoni knew, but with partner limited to 13 points, it was a reasonable "negative punt" to play 3@C|pg||
nt|jtr: I must admit to sneaking a look at GIB and he can make 11 now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Real men don't use GIB|pg||
nt|jtr: Possibly South had shown a minimum?|pg||

nt|peachy: S is strong enough to open naturally, with longest suit, follow up with diamonds twice|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: Great bid:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  is N a chicken?|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm, I would just bid 3D, 3S sounds too weak|pg||
nt|peachy: but perhaps 3S is their sys|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best game on EW 3nt on W|pg||
nt|xenya: S's hand is a near Yarborough -- the @D10 spoils the picture |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=ART GF|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Art Garfunkel?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=5+@H & 5+@C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I think East and West have minimum, both oif them|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like that|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1 @S - OUF|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N hand close to a 2S bid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: THIS HAS MADE THE MATCH COME ALIVE NOW|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Sry for caps|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: plus the club duplication|pg||

nt|fann4: Very aggressive 2@D overcall here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has just had great success pushing EW around, and undoubtedly wants to go to the well again right away|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agressive and may mislead partner to 5@d sacrifice|pg||
nt|shevek: multi 2@d worked well here|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: well when the opps bounce to 4@S opener has too big a problem i prefer something like 2n as the strong gf raise|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @S is a good bid - for E/W, now East waill avoi the @D-lead|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N by E|pg||
nt|po-s: 3NT I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=6-13 HCP, 4+@S|pg||
nt|po-s: to put necomers in the picture - SARA needs ten more vPs than SouthSweden to qualify|pg||
nt|shevek: in the KO phase, the team with the higher position from the Swiss gets a ½IMP carryover|pg||
nt|tez: actually neither is correct for the given hand|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not fure ASTRO would work, unless  you're referring to their recommendation you bid your short suit at the 3-level on a 3-suiter|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sfoxa:  if you expect partner to re-open with E hand - 3 @s seems ok|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is E planning to pass?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: N should have raised diamonds, with partner reversing, it is unlikely that would drive opps to a making 4S|pg||
nt|gracelin: they also play CAPP over 1NT opening, so 2D shows both maors.|pg||
nt|flash: practical call?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not Garfunkel   this GF gets more respect|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D=@D   go figure|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has now bid only only the suit in which he has about 6% of his HCP :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and in the OR they are in 6 nt by W|pg||
nt|sybarra: with a sp lead |pg||
nt|marlowepi: in the unbid portion of his hand his per capita HCP average is 2.5 :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Klinger had option to bid 4@H to show solid/1-loser suit|pg||
nt|shevek: try to be impartial PO :) (commentator's ethics, etc...)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: EW cannot miss game now|pg||
nt|po-s: now game?|pg||
nt|peachy: unusual decision|pg||
mb|3C|nt|pelu: I almost didnt belive that he took the @D-finess -|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To me, South has NO 3 @C-bid|pg||
nt|shevek: I didn't cheer when ish played in 7@h missing 1 ace (and made it)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially with a sizeable lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no double from South, slightly surprising|pg||
nt|jbgood: point taken|pg||
nt|po-s: doubledummy on a spade lead ducked and another spade...|pg||
nt|po-s: give up a club and a diamond, then throw South in at the end for a heart favor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has to bid 3S here i think, and then W will bid 4D|pg||
nt|peachy: this game, if they stretch, could also make if def finds a wrong lead|pg||
nt|peachy: so match not over yet|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 2@S is Puppet to 2N   making 3@C INV   [where immediate 3@C would be game force]|pg||
nt|jcwla: Another monster result for Bulgaria here.|pg||
nt|po-s: is 12 a max?|pg||
nt|fann4: There is not much to the play here, so worth having a look at the play of the @H suit on the previous hand.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hawe45:  Strange decision - West has the hand for bidding 4 @S|pg||
nt|peachy: I suppose the operator will catch up with comparisons when has a chance|pg||
nt|kakasi: åÏÅµå¤©çAÌpÌ©çÅà¢¢Æv¢Ü·B|pg||
nt|peachy: unfortunately Nied did not understand that Lin was already bidding W hand|pg||
nt|po-s: shouldn´t be worse than a finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Good lead|pg||
nt|shevek: that was the problem, the lead :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: from the WOrld Championships, X was 4+ 4+ majors|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 5 @C wont be easy|pg||
mb|5C|nt|hawe45:  OK - thatÂ´s better|pg||
nt|po-s: but he might simply go for hearts in a simpler fashin|pg||
nt|po-s: fashion|pg||
nt|po-s: DJ isn´t very good either, is it|pg||
nt|xenya: it is not|pg||
nt|bbramley: 3@H looks down 1, -50 a good save vs. 3@D making 110 or 130|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E decided there was no way to show, so he i susing KC hoping to hide his hand as declarer:)|pg||
nt|po-s: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: EW are adopting the NS strategy of self-destruction :(|pg||
nt|peachy: bit score relief for Naniwada now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and 6 more imps for NANIWADA |pg||
nt|fann4: @HQ109 opposite A85432   what is the best play (in isolation) for 5 tricks.|pg||
nt|shevek: the right hand is dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: so, Lavazza team MUST stretch to have a chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duboin has perfect picture to find 4@H jumpm|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Bocchi is the best at stretching:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  11 or 12 tricks = same result - 6 IMPÂ´s|pg||
nt|po-s: I think he shows acceptance for hearts|pg||
nt|po-s: and decent diamonds|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6 or 7 here on @C guess and this match is tightening up.|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: oh, thats why he is so tall?|pg||
nt|po-s: have I supported anyone? ANYONE?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South will easily make 7 tricks...|pg||
nt|xenya: and perhaps concern about clubs|pg||
pc|s5|nt|po-s: so it leaves a club or a heart|pg||
nt|xenya: complex hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: they are in 3 @H in the other room |pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s it - you sit up here in the cold North, trying to find out, how to bid 4 @S - and North just did it|pg||
nt|loganrun: 3-2 spades plus 3-3 hearts or QJ doubleton|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there was a case for a low D lead after the NT bid|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: @H10    really??|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Bocchi will need a ladder to get into dummy|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hawe45:  Very bad lead this time|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not sure about result on 10, but before it was 22-17|pg||
nt|peachy: as well as her own|pg||
nt|marlowepi: odds heavily in favor of W shortness being in Ds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now 2 top hearts and Ds|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Absolutely NOT, po!|pg||
nt|xenya: nice auction|pg||
nt|po-s: and that is not only by looking at his hand....|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now Herman just needs to find Forrester's entry to get a heart ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Keep looking|pg||
nt|mdgraham: little does he know it's in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because he must have one after 3@H without A and Q, right?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But North had no good lead|pg||
nt|peachy: nice for everyone (well, except maybe Zimmerman team) to have a tight race to watch|pg||
nt|shevek: we're all impartial here, but hey, people like stories of success when all seemed lost :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: although he might suspect it |pg||
nt|po-s: this way is no good though|pg||
nt|sybarra: down 3!! |pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: maybe the @CA and another would have been better?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah - East just wanted to se the @H-signals from N/S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Unblock...|pg||
nt|xenya: but perhaps nothing is lost yet|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: he has 1 step now :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|xenya: this is a good example of aggressive bidding -- EW got just a bit too high, but that induced NS to go overboard too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i am tired -- was thinking West declaring @S  :(|pg||
nt|tez: easy to make 3|pg||
nt|po-s: let us see - cross ruffs?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hawe45:  Voila they say in France|pg||
nt|sybarra: on a low club lead fro N |pg||
nt|ahollan1: responses to RKC are 1430 ONLY when trump=@H|pg||
pc|sA|nt|po-s: but now North can break communications should declarer duck the diamond|pg||
nt|tez: now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|peachy: Bas really didn't want a ruff, I think he was trying for a lead not to give a trick or something|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|roswolf: 11 tricks made in the other room|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: or play to set uop @Hs|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: this likely to be around average     double for north might have gain quite a bit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Norht can happily keep the @HK8 over dummy's @HQ7|pg||
nt|hlortz: -2 looks normal|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|flash: again, http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings...   pls check out the Daily Bulletins|pg||
pc|s8|nt|marlowepi: preserving more options this way perhaps|pg||
nt|po-s: no, as a commentator you must do the opposite|pg||
nt|marlowepi: low D would have double benefit....get 2 D tricks, and conceal S hand better|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@S showed @HQ  said nothing about @S|pg||
nt|shevek: that's what he's doing I thk|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chick: I would think a higher club from W would make it clearer for partner to return @S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Endplay for overtrick instead|pg||
nt|sybarra2: but playing the sox off this hand!|pg||
nt|roswolf: the layout is very friendly for the x-ruff|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gracelin: yes, Lin is a very agressve bidder.  Nie didn't take account for that.  |pg||
nt|peachy: indeed|pg||
pc|c4|nt|peachy: Bob Drijver, sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4 pickups in a row will put Oz in the lead|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|xenya: seems it's a good thing (for EW) that W's hand is closed|pg||
nt|shevek: the bill for that 670 arrived (sorry PO)|pg||
nt|po-s: hope that everybody makes mistakes, goes down etc|pg||
nt|po-s: yep, they went one down |pg||
pc|dA|nt|bbramley: yes, good trump plays, now an extra club loser|pg||
nt|sybarra: play k of @C ruff with ace of @H and ht.  home |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5/6/6/14|pg||
nt|marlowepi: of course, N would have to put up D queen:)|pg||
nt|tez: with open hands:)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: but if that 3rd D was ruffed, a spade could come back and heart queen could be promoted via another D|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 22-18|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What if East now ruffs an uncovered @C Q???|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: two pairs in 6@S!|pg||
nt|po-s: post mortem: he could always make it if I keep the CK|pg||
nt|xenya: E's final pass may not be unreasonable (@SQJ looks like a waste), still a bit timid|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: i dont get it at all|pg||
nt|gracelin: with hearts breaking 3-3, n chance for any end-play|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gracelin: no|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes cross ruff now|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bbramley: -100 better at matchpoints|pg||
nt|flash: round 8 of the Swiss qualifying scheduled in 55 minutes|pg||
nt|sybarra: and not in game :(  (he is thinking)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|flash: 12 rounds of Swiss; then 8 teams advance to the KO stage|pg||
nt|ralfwil: exit in @c|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is 14 board match, but we began with  17 so last is  30|pg||

nt|jcwla: Another biggie comin' up.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hlortz: undoubled!!|pg||

nt|jbgood: :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: You can't win them all|pg||

pc|c8|pc|d9|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Nunes IS GIB|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: i think EW here will reach 4@s again|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|brgpro: 2@c=the famous Gazilli?|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|brgpro: 2@d=8+ any|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@S = partner, I just have clubs, not extras|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Looks to me like he might have a few extras ...|pg||

nt|peachy: what was that?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S could have discarded losing spade on heart Q|pg||
nt|peachy: exactly|pg||
nt|sybarra: didnt "we" want to pitch one spade?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next door, S got helful @c A lead |pg||
nt|gracelin: So Lin's balamce turned a plus score into a minus one.|pg||
nt|peachy: the match 9 scores are now up http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|ahollan1: chalk that up to the EW system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the wide range 2N put South under a lot of pressure|pg||
nt|po-s: nice  auction because the HK is onside|pg||
nt|tejjyid: bring it on, Lavzza in full flight is awesome|pg||
nt|tejjyid: sofarthey have a slam off 2 Aces, anotehr slam on card reading + double squeeze|pg||
nt|shevek: 5 bds to go, 1 imp difference, what a final|pg||
nt|roswolf: now for the finale|pg||
nt|po-s: so now 1,5 imp needed|pg||
nt|roswolf: great stuff|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3 boards, 2 imps... anyone's match now|pg||
nt|roswolf: momentum with lavazza|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: maybe|pg||
nt|po-s: correct - he could have from the beginning though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is Lavazza still leading??|pg||
nt|shevek: how's 6@d?|pg||
nt|po-s: how many VPs is 21 imps?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S plenty high already|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Wrang sitting East gets full charge for 6N-1  [after partner asked key cards then bid 6@H - he pulled to 6N]|pg||
nt|hawe45:  More coffee|pg||
nt|po-s: hard to find diamond slam after 1NT|pg||
nt|shevek: well, 5 boards|pg||
mb|1S|nt|peachy: "we" did...|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW will probably end up in 3NT here.|pg||
nt|peachy: No, Nie's jump did it, IMO.  |pg||
nt|xenya: another game missed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: reverse black suits in W hand & very likely Ron would open at 4 level at these colors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S alerted because system on over DBL -- so MAX = 12 HCP|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, by 8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6D best here i think|pg||
nt|loganrun: Not bad PO better played by South|pg||
nt|shevek: 23-26|pg||
nt|shevek: sry 20-10VPs|pg||
nt|po-s: the other table: Klinger opened the east hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: X from South?|pg||
nt|peachy: same auction in other room, so far|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm a doubler, but people say I bid too much|pg||
nt|roswolf: remember zimmerann wins if scores tied|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|peachy: Open room was allowed to play in 4C, good for them|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Anyway the match seems to give a big score for the ladies|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting "save" in the OR |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: playing 2/1 is the south hand worth a 2/1 ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I think I know some folks who would open 4 @S on W hand|pg||
nt|flash: obviously, the defense has the first 4 tricks available here|pg||
nt|po-s: so EW had no problem finding 4S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Lay-down slam even with ! 4-0|pg||
nt|tez: normal for me|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Sry 5... why do i keep thinking 62 boards?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hawe45:  E/W 130 in OR is a good result for NL|pg||
nt|po-s: funny hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: agree, Lin might double the weak NT opening with a stronger hand.|pg||
nt|flash: Multi - weak 2 in a major; 2@H pass or correct|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Big result for Italy in OR|pg||
nt|flash: knowing quite well that a 2@S call won't be forthcoming|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, a few good hands in a row for them|pg||
nt|xenya: potentially|pg||
nt|po-s: ah, you think that´s why he opened 1NT to make South declarer in diamonds (with a transfer bid)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H|pg||
nt|ritong: will not cost a lot|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely a push |pg||
nt|tez: i belive same score here|pg||
nt|roswolf: they have0.5 imp as a carryover|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: n/s can make 9 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|peachy: right|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I vote for South Sweden - itÂ´s only 50 kilometers from here...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 9 trix each way|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: anybody see a result other than down 3?|pg||
nt|chick: not unless E drops a card on the table accidently|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, making. but that would be 5D :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: only a @C lead will give 6@H a problem|pg||
nt|marlowepi: doesnt look good for playing in Ds|pg||
nt|po-s: sorry - the West hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: That's what you get for overcalling 2@S vul against not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H is dead as a rat|pg||
nt|ady: should be over the top   minor suit queens badly placed|pg||
nt|hlortz: 2@S was a sort of prebalance but south didnt know that|pg||
nt|jtr: He had a  tough decision|pg||
nt|peachy: I think best now to bang down the spades|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Lead the @D Ace - and lose 620|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S making on same auction in the other room |pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe down 4 if Klinger ducks 1st @D|pg||
nt|fann4: A flattish board again.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as opposed to a warped board?:)|pg||
nt|fann4: :)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: the auction i mean|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Strange choice|pg||
nt|po-s: no Hans not to South (Africa)|pg||
nt|loganrun: good plan - although not fashionable I would open 1D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wonder on what page of his classix text on Losing Trick Count he recommends opening that hand? :):)|pg||
nt|po-s: East showed hearts - I´m surprised West didn´t bid 3H|pg||
nt|xenya: well W could have AK of hearts -- if not, 5@D is on a finesse -- good odds|pg||
nt|shevek: same auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: that's what you get for predicting|pg||
nt|shevek: what a good way to avoid ties|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Black humor|pg||
nt|po-s: odds come down a bit when North had intervened|pg||
nt|shevek: same lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: which rat's that, Roland? |pg||
nt|gracelin: they might wrongsided the 3NT cntract, but luckily, DJ is in north hand.|pg||
nt|peachy: must find H in either slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Puppet Stayman auction   3@D=at least 1 4-card major   3@S=4@H, not 4@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you can do it a lot later in 6D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once W shows 4 diamonds, winning heart play stands out|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 8.5 losers, with over 1/3 of his points a KJ doubleton|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no ideas about 6@h in OR|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT is sort of forced but no problem once you get there|pg||
nt|peachy: this is makeable, but lots of work. Of course "makeable" seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of work|pg||
nt|po-s: I think 3NT denies splinter - good raise to 4H|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: tricky to defend|pg||
nt|xenya: @H switch beats it as we all can see -- but N can't|pg||
nt|tez: vulnarable is important..we knew|pg||
nt|ritong: the @c is known to be a singleton|pg||
nt|tez: vulnerability|pg||
nt|po-s: oops|pg||
nt|shevek: they bid it fast!|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and Lavazza go into the lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes winning the qualifying has its advantages|pg||
nt|roswolf: well declarer isnt off yet|pg||
nt|po-s: no lead seems to let this through|pg||
pc|c4|nt|peachy: no spade lead and we are talking numbers...|pg||
nt|peachy: but thsat is of course seeing all four hands|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H-lead is the TOP|pg||
nt|peachy: I think diamond could possible be even better|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S Jack would have worked well...!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mullamphy upgrade to 15-17 NT borderline    K&R says hand worth 14.70  http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=5-card Stayman|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=not 5@H/@S and MINIMUM|pg||
nt|loganrun: Now 3NT could go off on a spade lead but not on this hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  660 here and 650 at the other table, I presume|pg||
nt|shevek: @h finesse then @d finesse?|pg||
nt|ritong: since balicki has the @s A, the non @s lead is explainable only with a shortness|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: can South be endplayed ?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: One of my cats brought back a dead rat last night. Thanks very much|pg||
nt|xenya: yes he can|pg||
nt|peachy: no lead attractive from N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could go down smaller if ace of clubs club now:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but the wonders of this part of the imp scale   300/400  still 14 IMPs -- thanks Nick|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jtr: How was breakfast?:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks to our operator, and not least kaksi. We have an accurate score on the board now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well done guys!|pg||
nt|peachy: Bravo, kaksi, Roland and operator!|pg||
nt|peachy: kakasi|pg||
nt|Walddk4: kakasi whose real name is Satoshi Imai|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best defence is @C Ace and a @H - double-dummy|pg||
nt|peachy: Groenenboom can play whichever club, he doesnt know yet it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If West has the @H Queen, he will get it anyway|pg||
nt|po-s: good sacrifice in 5C|pg||
nt|hlortz: well the 10@H dropping is a clue also..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C is 4-card Stayman|pg||
nt|po-s: The diamonds are so good, and the aces are not NTfriendly|pg||
nt|rodal f: For specs BBO-TV: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|po-s: but this one he passed as West|pg||
nt|othered1: Potential for a 2-way swing here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this one is a better hand, but still a comfy pass|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will @D 10 followed by the 9 wake up South?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: are EW playing 4-card majors?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spade lead seems odd if 5-card majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Precision -- 5-baggers|pg||
nt|po-s: they just transferred and bid game over 1NT|pg||
nt|tez: i m getting help from someone|pg||
nt|tez: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: in french we call this @c move a "lob", dunno the english expression|pg||
nt|tejjyid: which @C move?|pg||
nt|ritong: playing through the known single|pg||
nt|tejjyid: has no name that I know, unless you count avoidance|pg||
nt|tez: what do you bid with S hand?|pg||
nt|ritong: i don t, since avoidance consists in avoiding to give the lead to a specific opponent|pg||
nt|sybarra: isnt 1 @S ok?|pg||
nt|tez: y|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2@S the 1st time|pg||
nt|roswolf: even dd this is off|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: not if North uses the @H10|pg||
nt|roswolf: but while there is hope there is life|pg||
nt|po-s: if Gib says it makes with hear lead I guess we shouldn´t be too sure we can beat it|pg||
nt|shevek: certainly declarer has hopes...|pg||
nt|shevek: he doesn't know he has 2 trump losers|pg||
nt|roswolf: even if declarer suspects the distribution i cannot see where 10 tricks come from|pg||
nt|po-s: I guess you can win the heart, cash another a spade to ace, club finesse and spades??|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  And @H 10|pg||
nt|peachy: probably will lead diamond, leastr self-destructive without seeing all hands|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer has stronger spot cards in club but he might go after spade since he has no entry for the long club suit.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing now    4@S=RKCB  5@C=3 keycards, 5@D asks @HQ  5@S=yes and @SK|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|peachy: likely not making|pg||
nt|peachy: well, as long as they dont go for 7, all good for bulgaria|pg||
nt|hlortz: will E find a @C lead? i bet no|pg||
nt|shevek: he hopes the @h finesse is on|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|peachy: chance to make six now|pg||
nt|peachy: and either works, even without entry to clubs, friendly hand for ew|pg||
nt|peachy: well, I goofed, clubs dont work LOL|pg||
nt|po-s: yes East has made a slam try|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hlortz: up k@D ruff a @H 2 trumps exit a @D think he could make dbl dummy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Also OK|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes, with 1-1 @Cs and double @H finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I found Convention Card Stefanov used in Beijing with Aronov -- will see how much applies [if my network stabilizes]|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: reverse count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N said   a) no 4 card major  b) not 4333   [so 4@C & 4@D or 5@C/@D]|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Should be flat - 620|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sfoxa:  anyway, 5-6 imps back to Kitty's |pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow -- that's greedy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this is Ron's favorite application of Losing Trick Count:)|pg||
nt|chick: gutsy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we can probably generate a couple hands where that was declarer's 9th trick|pg||
nt|shevek: baaaad news|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is the discarding odd/even?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if they have way to find @DQ they were going to find the grand|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe 2 @S is right given the 1 @C (big hand on my left) |pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk4: I think this will fall apart for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 500 not unlikely|pg||
nt|tez: over 4@h|pg||
nt|peachy: I havent placed my bet about this hand|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a spec replies "not really with the misfit, one of the reasons 2/1 is difficult to play (without the "Old Black Magic" it was meant to obviate)."|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|jbgood: and a club to the king|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: what if N now cashed 5 clubs or so  |pg||
nt|chick: there are a lot of hands that N could hold where he could now cash 7 more tircks|pg||
nt|chick: tricks*|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|po-s: well done|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D 9 was enough...|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hawe45:  Well done|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and i agree|pg||
nt|po-s: we have established that|pg||
nt|shevek: new leader|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: would seem normal for N to hope S had something like JT f hearts and a card, and attack hearts from the getgo|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hawe45:  But I doÂ´nt like this @H Ace still in dummy|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6@D over 5@S?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's going well so far though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the 4-1 trumps is a problem|pg||
nt|tejjyid: E will be prety much double dummy from here, so no errors expected|pg||
nt|peachy: and the fact that E still has H to get out of her hand|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Verhees did very well to land 4@C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South must face thew facts partner MUST have values in @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- Mullamphy's odd @S7 was encouraging|pg||
nt|marlowepi: doesnt matter|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry priv|pg||
nt|tejjyid: pass, I bid my hand already|pg||
pc|cT|nt|xenya: indeed -- does 2@S NS make?|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ruff heart, club queen throwing D|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk4: and he did|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Still in time!|pg||
nt|peachy: it doesnt matter if he does or doesnt, entry to diam must be killed|pg||
nt|po-s: - it would be nastier to play back a club before taking the ruff...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you can ruff that|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hlortz: easy from up here|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|gracelin: all went well, as we already know.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d5|nt|hawe45:  The 130 for Verhees will not be mentioned after the match|pg||
nt|peachy: so looks like Lavazza prevails in this match and keeps their  1 position in the running scores|pg||
nt|flash: Zimmermann won the Transnational Teams in Sao Paulo and has retained the same team for the Rosenblum in Philadelphia|pg||
nt|tejjyid: there sin't much upside - they won'tbe tempted by 5@H|pg||
nt|peachy: TAKE IT|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jtr: wow|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|peachy: i wonder whats going on, connection? or they thinking? or me?|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess south is thining, in case his partner has CA|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am not sure now. It's been too long.|pg||
nt|peachy: no way to contact the operator, they dont speak english or read|pg||
pc|h4|nt|peachy: This was a good play, whats the name of this Deschapelles? even if declarer had Qxxx hearts, it was right|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Merrimac Coup|pg||
nt|po-s: I think one must bid 2H. It is imossible to clarify later that you have a sixloser hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|peachy: Thanks Roland, I dont remember the names much :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or just Axxx of hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but this I'm told this is a different Stefanov :(|pg||
nt|po-s: impossible is what I intended|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and a 6-card-suit|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jbgood: excellent|pg||
nt|po-s: Ish is contemplating his trump play - if one defender ha Hx|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Squeeze me oartner!|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: well done in both rooms|pg||
mc|9|nt|ahollan1: with almost identical auctions|pg||
pg||

nt|jtr: BBO prides itself on bringing you exciting finishes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: A game of two halves|pg||
nt|jtr: No other site can do this:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Deja vu perhaps. Zimmermann lost on a tie-break last Saturday with a 54 IMP lead going into the last set|pg||
mb|1N|nt|brgpro: 3@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: no?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: French Premier League, semi-finals|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The winning decision is to just play 3@C here|pg||
nt|brgpro: u cant|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|bjacobs: But if he messes with Stayman, ... the roof could fall in|pg||
nt|brgpro: E will not let u|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12-14  almost any shape possible   5422  6322  441, not 5-4 in the majors, though|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: 4441|pg||
nt|jtr: Will West protect?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bjacobs: Should Bocchi "pre-balance"?|pg||
nt|jtr: Or East bid now even|pg||
nt|brgpro: will he enter 3@d now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2NT is a transfer, including many hand types|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A slightly risky but very winning bid|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bjacobs: He just needs to keep partner under control|pg||
nt|jtr: I prefer it immediately if allowed with their methods|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|brgpro: well, 3@s shd imply @d fit|pg||
nt|brgpro: because he didnt bid 3@s on 2NT|pg||
nt|brgpro: so can't be a great suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He did have quite nice defence to 3NT :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brgpro: well, 5@d can be made here i believe, on the obvious @cK lead of course|pg||
nt|jtr: WEll judgedd|pg||
nt|brgpro: @h lead beats it|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bjacobs: Why is that?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|nt|brgpro: @h lead takes the entry away|pg||
nt|jtr: Takes out an entry|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh sorry, you are talking about 5|pg||
nt|jtr: He did say|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|brgpro: now win @cA then @sA @s ruff, @d6 to 7...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yes, yes, all my fault, as usual|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jtr: Poor Bill@h|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, he wants to make 4 now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Poles are indeed in 4@S on 60, so a new leader we will have shortly|pg||
mc|10|nt|brgpro: afraid @d might be 3-0 although a small chance|pg||
pg||
qx|c61|st||md|3S75HQT76D4CKQJ754,SAT8643HA4DK73CT9,SKQJ2HKJ92DA5C863,S9H853DQJT9862CA2|sv|b|nt|jtr: Amazing you taught him so much in one session:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: can make double dummy of course. diamond king and spade finesse. but declarer should put in the diamond ten at trick one to try to force a dummy entry|pg||
nt|peachy: other table behind a bit, maybe still some connection issues? |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  what a bloody result next door!|pg||
nt|po-s: seems you lose a spade a heart and 3 minor tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N had 8 tricks he would probably just be taking them rather than letting himself go down 2 extra tricks|pg||
nt|jcwla: yup, gold star to lavazza for the 6@D in the or|pg||
nt|marlowepi: just reward. the tiny extra edge came in|pg||
nt|po-s: and denied a diamond control it seems - so West should perhaps admitted to having that -asy to say when you see everything|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another 2-bid here - by North? |pg||
nt|tejjyid: well, kept us interested|pg||
nt|peachy: give me my nitro, that was too eciting|pg||
nt|roswolf: can lavazza consolidate?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|peachy: x|pg||
mb|3D|nt|peachy: could well be duplicated here|pg||
nt|xenya: right, so the 3@D bid was not also quite natural but also correct|pg||
nt|po-s: - and perhaps one in the wash|pg||
nt|hlortz: undo?|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the original Blue Team Club -- North would open 3@C  -- how's that for useless trivia|pg||
nt|po-s: anyway, you say 23 is 20-10 in VPs, so another 2 imps is what SARA would need|pg||
nt|sybarra: as predicted... |pg||
nt|po-s: grat hands..|pg||
nt|jcwla: Ooh, I recognize this hand.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: they have a decent result from the open room|pg||
mb|d|nt|peachy: ah, no|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's not the end )))|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes is that multi?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: can play either opp for honor x, but this gains on the layout shown|pg||
nt|roswolf: i expect e/w to bid game here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|po-s: wrong bidders|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alert must mean 1@C=2+   which North surely has|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another 6 @H - with @D behaving|pg||
nt|po-s: but he gave up the possibility to get 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: must include the stong version |pg||
nt|marlowepi: i double the operator|pg||
nt|shevek: now NS might bid 4@h and go down on @s lead   lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 14 is the last board of the match; restart 10 minutes to the hour with the last match today|pg||
nt|flash: perhaps the issue here is the margin, rather than the outcome?  as long as both finish in the top 8, they advance to the KO phase|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  one more coffee-board|pg||
nt|fann4: The bidding should be starting with 1@H by E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: rotate 90 degrees please:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: a spectator is questioning the board 17 result in Open Room - believes 3D was a make - not 1 down|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yeah, mynormal ruber holding|pg||
mb|4D|nt|marlowepi: 2C?|pg||
nt|peachy: i like 2C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is more like a 2C opener than a 2C rebid|pg||
nt|flash: of course, the higher a team finishes, the more control they retain over their opponents in the KOs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: common treatment in Europe  is for 1x-(1@H)-DBL to DENY 4+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we have another Italian DBL that can't be described confidently|pg||
nt|xenya: boards 10 and 12 are potentially very good for Sara|pg||
nt|hawe45:  IsÂ´nt 6 @H a fair shot from SouthÂ´s position?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hardly the 18-20 HCP  [semi]balanced hand most of us expect for 4@H|pg||
nt|shevek: no no, I say 19-22 is 20-10VP|pg||
nt|shevek: 23-26 is 21 VP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: obviously missing Gower's opening PASS|pg||
nt|hawe45:  New leader now|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: yes, it only took 24 boards|pg||
nt|peachy: lets see how 3NT fares...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S or 4@C now?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what now by S?  XX?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: för tidigt! och @sA fel!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 2@H now?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even 3C by N would have been an underbid|pg||
nt|chick: a nice reverse into 2@H would have been my choice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm, misfit in spades, 2C is a pretty wideranging bid, admittedly max here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 17:13 in Japan now|pg||
nt|flash: 1@D shows at least 4 and a shapely hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: EW mak 2N|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this won;t help the comeback|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: my point is that with openings becoming very light these days you need better hands to respond 2/1|pg||
nt|roswolf: a quiet pass is in order|pg||
nt|roswolf: there is a time when discretion is the better part of valour|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Operator -pl UNDO!|pg||
nt|flash: 2@C usually shows 9 card in the minors, either way|pg||
nt|po-s: mind you - that is to pass South Sweden - it does not mean that SS get knocked out as they are 5th at the moment|pg||
nt|loganrun: 1NT - not my chioce |pg||
nt|shevek: 2@c some sort of relay|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: push bd and 3imps with 3 boards to go|pg||
nt|roswolf: wd|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: if it is THIS wide-ranging, you will end up in 2C when slam is on a finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: trying to get it corrected |pg||
nt|bbramley: 3-1 trumps would have made it much more complicated|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Apteker is liking this more and more with each round of bidding|pg||
nt|othered1: hasn't north done a lot of bidding, considering the @SK isn't full value?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Short of entries, East might play @D to the Ace.|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe 1@s was Xfer to 1NT?|pg||
nt|shevek: Dbl I mean|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok  here was the 4 + @D and 5 +   major again |pg||
nt|po-s: now we know that 2D shows opening with D and longer hearts|pg||
pc|c9|nt|gracelin: it may go 3S and 3NT, not a great contract.|pg||
nt|flash: 2@H probably shows the 1444|pg||
nt|po-s: yes it was|pg||
nt|fann4: The @C ruff will later see the @HQ falling - an easy 4@H.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: fortune favors the bold|pg||
nt|shevek: one off for a flat board|pg||
nt|odysseus69: another question about result on board 20 - should be a push|pg||
nt|po-s: would you open the hand? I suppose yes, then you must bid 2H|pg||
nt|po-s: it looks un beatable- Or?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: my point Po is that you need much better hands to respond 2/1 than to open  :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|peachy: i dont see a prob off hand, who knows maybe there is one I just dont see it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the only question is communication. but N is known to have all the points (almost), so couldn't be a problem for declarer to collect  9 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: i think he'll get an overtrick if careful|pg||
nt|peachy: aceless softie, unless to my surprise 4C were forcing, cant be|pg||
nt|ahollan1: each player wary of void in partner's other suit|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if the results are wrong on BBO the players will correct them when they come to score up so its not fatal unless the scores are close- as they are now becoming|pg||
nt|po-s: guess he should have covered|pg||
nt|shevek: irrelevant|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2@D=BAL 18-19, not 5@H/@S   |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|xenya: a VERY lucky 3N...|pg||
nt|hlortz: w needs to overtake the @H trick 1 and play @S to beat 5@C easy for these guys im sure|pg||
nt|xenya: and rightly so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and not a great slam because of having to guess @S at trick one  :)|pg||
nt|po-s: ajor|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d=18 19 balaced|pg||
nt|tejjyid: one of the bridge world's more bizarre conventions|pg||
nt|tez: 2@s=relay to 2 nt|pg||
nt|othered1: this is just like a standard 18-19 2N - 3N auction.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|peachy: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|peachy: not at all, 3S the last making one, but if EW in other room play 15-17NT (I dont know if they do) might go same way|pg||
nt|flash: although it might just be patterning out (1354 or 1345) with a max for not opening 1@C|pg||
nt|peachy: 1D-1S-2C shows 5-4 or 4-5 minors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they are in GF and S is unlimited. N has good cards, good IN-OUT valuation|pg||
nt|othered1: Wouldn't north have bid the same, to imply stiff @S, if the @SK work a working K?|pg||
nt|sybarra: fast arrival "hopefully"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe aceless and somewhat soft, but all values are working|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer will be lucky to excape with 2 down|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: nice fit|pg||
nt|chick: at least they got into a makeable game :)|pg||
nt|peachy: well, might|pg||
nt|po-s: 3S shows good with short diamonds|pg||
nt|peachy: according to sys card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow -- why so pessimistic?   [even if it is the max they can make]|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Small @s lead seems best - West must take Ace to keep an entry to dummyÂ´s @C-tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|peachy: nice judgment by Merijn Groenenboom|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I expect a flat board, losing 1 spade, 1 heart and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|sybarra: and was same in other room (correctly) |pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently it was, but i dont know why S bid it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course VIctor Mollo's Hideous Hog said   you have to bid bad slams -- because so many good ones go down|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s because of the cue-bid - bidding with closed eyes 6 @H, it is a fair slam|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Slam score at board 10|pg||
nt|po-s: silly bid, 3S IMHO|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|peachy: theygot there anyway, at least|pg||
nt|peachy: in the other room, bulgarian EW put NS to a guess, well done|pg||
nt|othered1: lucky @C position and @D hold-up will let this make|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D shift now isnt declarer in trouble?|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe not |pg||
nt|othered1: duck one, pull trump, lead @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: does Ish lay down the ace of clubs now?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: here is dummy in 2C:    xxxxx   Axx   Axxxx  ---       partner will certainly pass 2C and slam is on heart queen|pg||
nt|po-s: this time the hearts behave. You need to guess how to treat diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: easy slam|pg||
nt|po-s: I would have had more understanding for 4S|pg||
nt|po-s: in my humble opinion|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hlortz: fortunately this is a simple 4@S making so we arent missing anything|pg||
nt|sybarra: really?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might lose @C to ensure game??|pg||
nt|sybarra: only if @D's break I thnk|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has semimasked his club holding, but declarer shd still go right in trumps|pg||
nt|fann4: So now declarer will surely lose a trump trick, but then make the @CQ.|pg||
nt|fann4: Oh sorry, I missed the take out dbl with the changed bidding. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: S almost has to have a stiff heart to double at these colors facing a PH|pg||
nt|ralfwil: unbeatanle yes! 4 rounds of @c and N is on play|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|peachy: our predictions havent really fetched tonightm have they Sveta :)|pg||
nt|xenya: @C shift was needed to beat it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 7@s on board 9:)|pg||
nt|xenya: 17:)|pg||
nt|xenya: imps|pg||
nt|xenya: lucky|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But with a @s exit from N????|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: and will be a simple cliam by operator (easiest) |pg||
nt|sybarra2: why not just transfer to @s' /|pg||
nt|peachy: would be pretty conservative not to be in game vul IMPs|pg||
nt|hlortz: so 6 imps for staying out of game|pg||
nt|jcwla: Terrific bidding by Bulgaria in this match.  No bidding on last bd at least in OR.|pg||
nt|loganrun: If you can see around corners this is cold but declarer can't|pg||
pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: well i want to be in it if it is on 32 trumps. actually you need more, but it is still worthwhile. anyway when i said "easy" i meant easy to make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wonder why S didnt temporize with 4D which looks like a freebie. maybe that would have been KC|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly what i was thinking Marshall  when i used the "p" word  [pessimistic]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thought it stood for Pusillanimous|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and if E thinks S has only one top club honor, all the more so|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last set is scheduled to start in 55 minutes, but the two teams may agree on an early restart. We won't know until the last minute, so I suggest you don't go too far away when ...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sfoxa:  u r right, Raija|pg||
nt|shevek: that explains 1NT bid|pg||
nt|peachy: 3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: and he got that wrong|pg||
nt|sybarra2: then invite?  maybe I missed something earlier|pg||
nt|flash: we were speaking of shoes earlier - as usual, Mandala-Bocchi have their bidding shoes on!!!   another monster result|pg||
nt|othered1: push looks very likely here|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|po-s: I´m sure South wanted to bid - and had it been Sementa I believe he would have|pg||
pc|hK|nt|po-s: good play - the ten might be fromAJT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So would E/W po-s|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and I|pg||
nt|shevek: the @c loser can't run anywhere....|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jtr: There will be a few in slam on this one|pg||
nt|jbgood: may make 12 now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: multi-purpose  usage|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and in the last 2 boards the 2nd slam swing is written off |pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
nt|fann4: Not sure what 3@C meant, presumably some @C losers, so surprised no @CA lead.|pg||
nt|po-s: not quite irrelevant, goes 2 down now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: this set is over (board 48)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|po-s: thanks - IMQO is better|pg||
nt|peachy: kib accurately says "Now 4, do I hear 5?"|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|dJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  They have a VERI BIG set here|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, he new they had a fit in @h|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hawe45:  VERY|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i wait with bated breath|pg||
nt|ralfwil: let N win!|pg||
mc|10|nt|shevek: 2 down now and 3 imps to Lavazza|pg||
nt|po-s: did he really?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3 bds to go|pg||

mb|p|nt|brgpro: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|jtr: no|pg||
nt|jtr: no|pg||
nt|brgpro: NOOoooooo|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No, they don't open at the 2 level with 5422 shape|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's either 1NT or pass|pg||
nt|jtr: ah|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Having watched a lot of their play, this seems to be a strict rule|pg||
nt|jtr: Bill, you have redeemed yourself|pg||
mb|1H|nt|brgpro: Madala is afraid of a @s overcall|pg||
nt|jtr: In @ss|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|brgpro: that's why he thought for a while b4 opening 1@h|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|jtr: 3@h looks ok|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H might roll in|pg||
nt|jtr: as a bid i mean|pg||
nt|bjacobs: N/S need to get a diamond ruff, pronto|pg||
nt|brgpro: but since he didn't know whether open 3 o4 4@h, so he decided to open 1 anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: What do you think about a diamond lead as North?  possible?|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, even if they dont it is not all chopped liver|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easier for North to find the D lead than it would have been for South with that holding in spades|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: The play in 4@H will be interseting on any lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: It's true that the game might still go down on a non-diamond lead|pg||
nt|jtr: But Fantoni will lead a @d anyway|pg||
nt|brgpro: 4@h can be made w/o @d ruff ( which is not obvious for defence), of course it is not obvious to take the right view in sides suits anyway|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Except a club, maybe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Club is not unreasonable|pg||
nt|brgpro: 4@s did fail a trick|pg||
nt|jtr: did well to make 9 even and that trick might be vital|pg||
nt|brgpro: so Lavazza takes the lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Zimmerman needs to find 4 imps from somewhere|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A club lead is real interesting - should declarer play low?|pg||
nt|brgpro: even without @d ruff, declarer has to guess the side suits well to make this|pg||
pc|s3|nt|brgpro: nothing is obvious|pg||
nt|brgpro: his @d spots are not good enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What drama|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|jtr: he didnt have anything to pitch on the @s yet and maybe got some info|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: And I forgot to close the room at 1500|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: We can see he should pitch a diamond and lead a low club from dummy :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Want me to leave Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I need 60 to leave|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 70|pg||
nt|Walddk2: counting|pg||
nt|jtr: FIRE!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The simple line is clearly to play for diamonds 3-3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The question is whether there's other plays that can add to that chance|pg||
nt|bjacobs: (but not subtract from it)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Warning: your screen may vanish in smoke if you don't leave the room. It only applies to certain parts of the world. NI is one|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, he might be able to test that before taking a pitch|pg||
nt|jtr: No, he needed to keep another @s maybe|pg||
nt|brgpro: he has to play a small @d to the Q and duck the next one...which is not obvious|pg||
nt|brgpro: so i would bet his won't make this|pg||
nt|jtr: Obvious is somewhat of an understatement:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm struggling to find any added chance other than @CKQ doubleton somewhere|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, say he had ekpt another @s|pg||
nt|brgpro: @d 10 might work but if N is awake and goes up the A...|pg||
nt|jtr: He plays a @d to to Q|pg||
nt|jtr: They retruna @s ruffed now the @dJ|pg||
nt|jtr: No that doesnt work either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 61 was flat|pg||
nt|brgpro: @d10 N might duck|pg||
nt|jtr: Tomorrow|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|cuttysark: later to-day when he is asleep |pg||
nt|brgpro: i said if N is awake and puts up the A|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brgpro: now he can pitch a @d and play small @c from dummy...|pg||
nt|brgpro: depends on how he guesses the hand|pg||
nt|jtr: Pseudo squeezed|pg||
nt|cuttysark: No special reason to get this right|pg||
nt|jtr: He will ruff i am sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can find about 9,321 BBO'ers who would get diamonds right|pg||
nt|brgpro: a lot of guesses, none of them is obvious. |pg||
nt|brgpro: to be honest|pg||
nt|brgpro: i am a bad guesser most of the times|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Realistically he will NEVER get the diamonds right.  But yes, he could divert to trying to get the clubs right|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s5|nt|jtr: Yeah yeah:)|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I like to think I guess right occasionally, but I think I am deluding myself|pg||
nt|brgpro: now N has to play a @s|pg||
nt|jtr: Now the decision|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|brgpro: last chance for him to guess right|pg||

nt|peachy: last hand on screen now.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  just for spectators - attentive and artistic E could have pitching @h ace on @s 3|pg||
nt|po-s: makes|pg||
nt|peachy: been a close match, last boards to decide|pg||
nt|xenya: last hand now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting line|pg||
nt|sybarra: and last hand now,  thx to all for joining us |pg||
nt|ahollan1: indeed they've had a very nice set|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But 13 might cost|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top 8 teams qualify for tomorrow's quarter final knockout round -- SARA currently in 15th place, OZ in 3rd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and seems in keeping with partnership style to be aggressive|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and figured any trump finesse would be on|pg||
nt|po-s: yes Gunnar but not when difference is 8|pg||
nt|peachy: two|pg||
nt|roswolf: the fat lady is still polishing her nails|pg||
nt|sunsamvar:  i thought that the @D3 is an entry for the 5th @S.. |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Will this be the flattest of flat 4@S's I wonder|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Probably not|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S for n/s    west will need to lead clubs to hold to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|hlortz: some wont bid game perhaps|pg||
nt|ady: why should it be flat   not all will lead a club|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you everyone, was a pleasure to keep company with you all, incl kibitsers!|pg||
nt|flash: next match scheduled in 40 minutes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when you miss slam you should make exactly five|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as has our Vugraph Operator -- well done!|pg||
nt|po-s: if South had discarded a heart he could have endplayed declarer for 2 down|pg||
nt|po-s: pretty good multi IMO|pg||
nt|po-s: how many boards in the QF?|pg||
nt|shevek: in fact he could've made 11 tricks, true|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hlortz: yes thx much|pg||
nt|po-s: nope , players can only guess the standing|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: Special thanks to Roland for his tireless efforts organizing the vugraph! |pg||
nt|marlowepi: thanks to great colleagues & great specs|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and this is last now for this room |pg||
nt|flash: we hope to see you then and/or at another BBO Vugraph presentation|pg||
nt|peachy: I am especially thanking our Polish spectators for their help with NS system!!!!!!!!!!! kudos.|pg||
nt|sybarra: a special thanks to our find operator |pg||
nt|marlowepi: great job by operator. thx to great colleagues and specs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only 1 14-board match remains after we finish here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: rotate please|pg||
nt|fann4: 2@S made 10 tricks in the OR, but a @H lead or shift will hold it to 9|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Easy 3 NT - but nor ig West bids 4 @S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  not|pg||

nt|po-s: hmmm|pg||
nt|po-s: ;)|pg||

mb|3H|nt|ady: 10@H may be the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last board now. Many thanks to our operator in Yokohama, and to kakasi, Raija and Hans|pg||
nt|peachy: Last board now, thank you to Japan Contract Bridge League, BBO, and our Roland Wald, for bringing this event to vugraph|pg||
nt|xenya: if it's customary for NS to open that light, they must have some machinery to let them stop low |pg||
nt|po-s: and if in 2NT you still need to ddo the right thing in D|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, that's true|pg||
nt|po-s: correct|pg||

nt|ahollan1: final match of qualifying swiss scheduled to begin in about 45 minutes|pg||

nt|sybarra: 2 x15 I think  |pg||
nt|po-s: if that isn´t a slamgoing hand...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: guessing that is a "better hand" 4S bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: tolld 2x16 sorry |pg||
nt|marlowepi: guessing they have one bid for all splinters|pg||
nt|po-s: me too|pg||

mb|3S|nt|ady: i think most will be in game|pg||

nt|shevek: did he preserve that @d2?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  and the greatest TNX to all the kibs - we are here for you|pg||
nt|po-s: even in 1NT|pg||
nt|hlortz: nope this is modern bidding u must be too old for it P.O. :)|pg||

nt|peachy: Hope you had as much fun as we did here|pg||
nt|xenya: a well-deserved win for England Ladies --  solid game by NS in this room|pg||
nt|peachy: rocky start for lavazza which never recovered, other than that, good bridge all the way|pg||
nt|hlortz: and stay tunedfor lots more great bridge from 15th NEC cup|pg||
nt|loganrun: game is pretty good on this board|pg||
nt|tez: DBL|pg||
nt|peachy: a peaceful hand now, though not making|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: wonder why Bocchi did not interfere and make life difficult|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: can anyone explain this bidding ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Finally, big thanks to NEC for sponsoring the event for the 15th time|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nand S play different system here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  N/S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You canb make 4 @C, but not 2 or 3 @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: next set scheduled for 1 hour 40 minutes|pg||
nt|othered1: duplicating the OR auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: next set about 30 minutes|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html    |pg||
nt|pelu: my calculation - dont trust me :) : 53-8|pg||
nt|sybarra: tourney website|pg||
nt|po-s: ace and trump?|pg||
nt|peachy: we all very happy that no connection problems this match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so sorry -- didn't refresh screen   correct SARA 6/7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and OZ 4th|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry 1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|po-s: so what? stiff heart and say Axxxx only in spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: specs think splinter, but when in my own experience Ish prefers i response to cover all splinters (clarified on next round), so 4H would be a better triple-raise hand than 4S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1@H=@S|pg||
nt|po-s: so 1H showed spades, and 2H 4th suit - or just a relay|pg||
nt|po-s: Is his hand good enough opposite partner´s short spade?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: have they found their @c suit?|pg||
nt|po-s: Sorry East has bid natural his suits |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Inportant with @c suppport for E|pg||
nt|po-s: I think he has shown more than 20 - already 2D was very strong. West might have nothing for his first bid|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: ouch|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that could be painful|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do the rest of you open 1@D  or  1N [15-17]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: is this the anti-X pause?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|flash: our operator!!!   a flawless performance!!!    my most abject apologies|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This should bring 9 lucky IMPÂ´s to Zimmermann|pg||
nt|po-s: they withdrew|pg||
nt|po-s: such pessimists|pg||
nt|tez: S  thinking..not E|pg||
pc|h3|nt|peachy: Appreciate the helpful comments from kibitzers, thank you!|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess this is an easy make|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you specs for your nice and helpful comments, keep'em coming|pg||
nt|sybarra2: Many thanks, to our operator.  A job well done!|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to all @H@H   |pg||
nt|shevek: this is the last board of the match, thanks to my fellow commentators, PO, Chris and Hans|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh no|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i got so many responses from specs and i am now confused :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another recovery?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sybarra: Restart is scheduled for:  7:20 pm Los Angeles, 10:20 pm New York, 04.20 Tuesday Paris, 3:20 am Tuesday London, 2:20 pm Tuesday Sydney|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  they managed to reach it - hope, W make it, too |pg||
nt|peachy: Here is the tournament website http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html|pg||
nt|hlortz: needs trump shift but that will just hold it i think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 9?|pg||
nt|peachy: Jim "Flash" Gordon, quick on his feet, humor, great analysis. And Hans from the cold North, wonderful!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nite all:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL would show 4+@H but show length as natural players do [@S first when 55]|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Facing 15-17, I would be in game as East|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'd prefer 1@d as well|pg||
nt|fann4: This can go for 800, so there could be a new leader.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too good suitwise for 1N facing unpoassed hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  due to 5-4 distribution|pg||
nt|po-s: and maybe 2H could be some signoff hand prepared to pass 2NT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hawe45:  Oh - new plansRight spot - they played the same system...|pg||
nt|peachy: this is a reasonable bet, neeed clubs to behave|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Perhaps Drijver thought that 3@C implied heart fit|pg||
nt|shevek: a big thank you to our excellent operator, to NEC for staging this great event, and to the JCBL (Akito Omasa)|pg||
nt|shevek: and last but not least thanks to our spectators who give us a reason to be here in the first place|pg||

nt|vugraphzcj: W nei is"go"world champion!!|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and at midnight,  it is time for bed for me |pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But there is a losing option - the @H-finesse|pg||
nt|xenya: a very thin game that could be beaten on a trump lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 10 tricks on a cross ruff|pg||
nt|xenya: but now...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Highly exciting and involving set of boards.|pg||
nt|peachy: Specs, you were so very quiet this match, you all are free to comment to us as much as you like :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: rarity on OR a passed out board|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks everyone, see you soon|pg||
nt|jcwla: One pd of mine says the passout decision is the best part of his game.|pg||
nt|sybarra: nicely bid Ish and Ash  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: the heart and spade P-O Sitions may make this tricky|pg||
nt|sybarra: and not X's|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: just under an hour|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - needs onle @S-suit 4-4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  only|pg||
nt|peachy: I thought about that. Many play fit jumps by PH|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D-switch is bad - tka this trick|pg||
nt|hawe45:  take|pg||
nt|peachy: he will figure it out.  Must take|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He might as well; he knows spades are 4-4 after the lead, no?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But a fast duck in @CÂ´s from West very soon - and we shall wee|pg||
nt|hawe45:  see|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but you need less luck in 2N and you won't go down 3 vulnerable |pg||
nt|xenya: good stop|pg||
nt|po-s: yes  absolutely - he might go down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good lead, what barryrigal suggested from his hidden loge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unanimous -- i think key is proud to reverse to 2@H over 1@S response|pg||
nt|marlowepi: better|pg||
nt|ritong: had zmud doubled 2@s, it would have meant " i had a penalty pass of the @cs", but it needs to have a landing place if @ss do not suit partner|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Might easily be 10 more IMPÂ´s|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|pelu: sone sunshine for Sweden - 4@S +420 in OR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kovachev must have forgotten he's not playing precision on this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where Mullamphy upgraded earlier NT, here Klinger downgraded|pg||
nt|hawe45:  100 in 4 @S D looks very cheap|pg||
nt|shevek: he did indeed|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ralfwil: but needs correct timing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @h ruffs before @c ruffs|pg||
nt|sybarra: we start again in about 20 min |pg||
nt|shevek: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec_bul.html|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jbgood: nothing but clubs to lead..|pg||
nt|vugraphzcs: Standings after 34 boards: 1. Sandqvist - McIntosch 66,8%, 2. Herman - Forrester 61,3%, 3. Brock - Sheehen 60,5%|pg||
nt|jtr: He is thinking of a trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzcs: Chmurski - Puczynski 56,2% (13)|pg||
nt|peachy: kib asks, which pairs played the first Segment of this Final.|pg||
nt|peachy: thanks kibs, so Lavazza had the same pairs in the first segment|pg||
nt|tejjyid: in Closed, was Duboin Sempala vs Baicky Zmudinski|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sfoxa:  and transmission will resume in an hour and a half |pg||
nt|po-s: do we know the score at all?|pg||
nt|peachy: gnite Shirely:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Even undoubled, that would be too little|pg||
nt|xenya: exact tie after this board|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: why ?did Bllicki pass with his 2 bullets|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jbgood: results: http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session2.htm scoretables|pg||
nt|hlortz: doesnt matter here but the slow j@C suggests e has another as w aj dbltn you would see a and prompt j :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s better than the finesse|pg||
nt|bbramley: he can claim 9 on a crossruff|pg||
nt|shevek: Sementa not happy...|pg||
nt|po-s: better throw a diamoond|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra2: supposedly another 10 inches on top of the 18 we got over the weekend |pg||
nt|roswolf: probably -1 whatever he does|pg||
pc|d3|nt|peachy: I'm going to watch some more, only 9PM here|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and once again it is snowing in Wash. DC......|pg||
nt|gracelin: Good night, Shirley.|pg||
nt|peachy: bummer, clear and cold here|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ty all :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why 8 of D? 6 would say "i like both" then N could choose|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not again -- he asked for @H  and only NOW thinking about what to play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: those are the moves that turn partner's hair white|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhhhh|pg||
nt|marlowepi: reverse suit preference?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: like his 3 card @D support, perhaps|pg||
nt|ritong: we said a landing place:) not an emergency spot|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: Matt needed 2@D as transfer to @H  ---  maybe that will be in Ron's next set of notes :)|pg||
nt|shevek: a simple defence would have been more efficient|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|peachy: better get the hearts going|pg||
nt|peachy: make a snowman and have fun|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|po-s: so how would you defend?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry, I had forgotÂ´n the thidr @S in dummy - that changes my opinion|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OK, Sementa, Balicki, |pg||
nt|tejjyid: Zmudzinski|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jtr: Yes, awkward|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Great recovery by the Dutch who were 0-16 doesn at some point|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu all in 20 min. |pg||
nt|po-s: hard not to get nine tricks|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well, a 5-3 fit is OK; this is standard Polish @C right?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sfoxa:  stats say to finess honour with ten, nothing changes when ten appears|pg||
nt|Walddk4: *down|pg||
nt|ritong: that s right, 1@d often comes from 5+|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|bbramley: risky to do otherwise|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|peachy: and have a hot toddy for breakfast, whatta way to start the day hehe|pg||
nt|flash: no compelling reason to go wrong, so...|pg||
nt|flash: extra chance?   ruff the @C, play 3 rounds of @Ds??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: defense gets to 7 tricks first|pg||
nt|po-s: will go down|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra2: thx,  mimosa works also :) |pg||
nt|sybarra2: cu all tomorrow (for me) and gn from here |pg||
nt|peachy: see ya, bye for now|pg||
nt|larrymori: on this hand, winning in hand would have been better|pg||
nt|shevek: he did make 11 tricks in prev bd|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|xenya: i expect EW to get to game in the other room  |pg||
nt|po-s: wrong timing|pg||
pc|s8|nt|tejjyid: sorry to all, nothing personal intended|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bbramley: those red 7's all look alike, but operator was trying for beer|pg||
nt|po-s: unless he draws another trump and fnesses hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: finesse now?|pg||
nt|po-s: seems natural to play his way|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sfoxa:  so, its over. just and push|pg||
nt|xenya: the fact that 1N might fail doesn't mean that you have to bid 3N|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's incompetence|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|peachy: Good bridge by both teams|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Undo the @C-discard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bulgaria declared spades in both rooms|pg||
nt|fann4: Only 500 now|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk4: Thanks all, back in about 25 minutes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bye for now|pg||
nt|peachy: bye now|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|sT|nt|po-s: have you seen that we are on a new hand?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|po-s: which I think was misplayed|pg||
nt|xenya: and it's the last hand too|pg||
nt|po-s: he should have ducked the spade it seems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: keep in mind - we're skeptical of some of the posted result  [ 7 300 instead of 200, and an overtrick somewhere]|pg||
nt|shevek: the team finishing 1st in the Swiss may choose their opponent from the teams finishing 4th-8th, etc...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: gap narrows|pg||
nt|tejjyid: looks like Zmudinski doesn;t think he has a penalty X of 3@C, let alone 2@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: stange not a @D lead dont you think?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|po-s: so if SARA bids this game....|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am told other room in 4H without a diamond lead|pg||
mc|8|nt|jtr: But he had time|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks everyone!! |pg||
nt|peachy: Bye for now!|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx again all see you back in 40 min |pg||
nt|xenya: crossruff yields only 9 tricks, so declarer needs another trick elsewhere |pg||
nt|shevek: Also, before the start of the KO and after all quarter-final draws have been determined,|pg||
nt|shevek: the team that finishes 1st in the Swiss chooses their SF opponent from any of the other three QF matches|pg||
nt|po-s: 19 is what? only 19-11??|pg||
nt|shevek: 19-22 is 20-10VP|pg||
nt|po-s: oops|pg||
nt|shevek: see you all in the open room :)|pg||

nt|brgpro: one last deciding board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not kidding|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The Italians by half a VP...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: which ones :)|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Those ones :)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|brgpro: so it is a pairs game now...only if the 8 of them will know...|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Let me take the opportunity to congratulate the organizers on their foresight|pg||
nt|brgpro: yes|pg||
mb|d!|nt|bjacobs: From an earlier hand, we know that this double shows points more than anything|pg||

mb|2D|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: @s lead would be good|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'll keep you updated on 62. That may be crucial|pg||

nt|jtr: But he can pitch a @d anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bidding 63 now|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2 boards remain in the match --  semi-finals after the break will also be 2 16-board segments|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6 IMPs, two to go|pg||
nt|imp_jan: P-O u r right this brd might be decisive|pg||

nt|tez: balicki end zmud playing reverse for dbls|pg||
nt|roswolf: atie = a zimmermann win|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: dead heat now... wow|pg||
nt|shevek: doesn't get any closer than this|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2 bds to go|pg||

nt|roswolf: an imp|pg||
nt|po-s: sorry half an imp |pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: 4S a lucky make|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be decisive|pg||
mb|2D!|an|d and M|nt|Walddk4: Maybe only 1 overtrick on 30|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think he has a penalty pass either, was just a parenthesis about the meaning of a possible double of 2@s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: interesting thata pair like Fantoni-Nunes can miss that slam|pg||
nt|po-s: 11 tricks?|pg||
nt|shevek: looking at the movie, Balicki made 11 tricks in bd 61|pg||
nt|po-s: sorry Richard, I´m too excited|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|roswolf: i think shows a 4 card major + diamonds|pg||
mb|3H!|an|p/c|nt|ady: 3NT  gets the best score here   but they may end in 5 or 6 diamonds|pg||
nt|po-s: true, but might lose to 98x in spades with West|pg||
nt|po-s: closer to ten|pg||
nt|po-s: but now...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: East set up a number of set games a few years ago|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@D needs to go a bit|pg||
nt|jtr: Naturalists vs Scientists|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now 3@H from South?|pg||
nt|roswolf: pls remember that the score you can see is UNOFFICIAL|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: really dislike Sylvan's 5@C bid in other room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bord 30 corrected|pg||
nt|shevek: score fixed in 30|pg||
nt|po-s: 12 he took|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: bidding 1 nt with a singleton king has become part of the system now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: south opened the hand in open room and stole the contract|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a decent contract but down|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: dbl?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spec wondering if 1S = both minors|pg||
nt|fann4: Well, one way to go plus is to stop at the one level.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South has done enough|pg||
nt|shevek: hard work in 3@h...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe more than enough|pg||
nt|po-s: on a spade lead from West in the otherroom East returned a diamond after winning the SK|pg||
nt|po-s: letting the contract through|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Too many quacks in the South hand, too slow in a high suit contract|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe West is thinking|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And the worst shape of them all|pg||
nt|tez: last 2 board|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Balicki|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I assume thats GF - doesn't look it though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: some kind of 2/1?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: very stupid D!!!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Like yesterday - play it Sam|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So-called service-double from North, helps opponents|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: if you go to the tourney website and click on score for the quarter, it will show table lineup as well as hand results    http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jtr: Not so terrible|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, not penalty, anyway  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe just showed clubs|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: neither side found the 6@C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 10 tricks? 2 redoubled overtricks|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|jbgood: when you have a good fit as EW here, bidding too much may easily push opps into  something they wouldnt bid if left to themselves|pg||
nt|shevek: 1@s = 0-3@s|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: what is happening in the other room?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ralfwil: Saved by the bell again!|pg||
nt|po-s: oh, they don´t need honour in the singleton suit, practically all 11-13 hands are opened 1NT (except if suitable for 10-13 2X|pg||
pc|hA|nt|po-s: spade back declarer must win|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and will|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Yes Po.. I was referring to a worldwide trend|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: trump lead best...|pg||
nt|jtr: haha|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is tricky to make 4  |pg||
pc|c2|nt|jbgood: endplayed at trick 1 - and 2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: let @sK win|pg||
nt|po-s: The other room also stopped below slam on previous board|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the @H double looks dangerous , but in many hands it may get 3 nt down by indicating lead to P|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|po-s: 6 was not best|pg||
nt|peachy: in the Finals, you will also get actual hands shown|pg||
nt|peachy: on the website|pg||
nt|po-s: 3NT decent contract but not this time|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: south will have to give 1 trick|pg||
nt|hlortz: i think w should have bid say 3@H the round before rather than giving opponents the option here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why the 6???|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|jtr: His partner bid it for him|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thx|pg||
nt|tez: 5 with open hands|pg||
nt|janm: Interesting that Nunes thought the South hand was good enough for one of their somewhat strong weak 2 bids, but Madalal didn't want to open 2@h - I guess he likes to have his ...|pg||
nt|janm: values in the suit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Chance to make now|pg||
nt|tejjyid: needed a @S switch|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|po-s: unblocking...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: take restricted choice in @C and West will prevail|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, he just has to take the right view in clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: and spades, that is to avoid S fin|pg||
nt|janm: Maybe Madala should have discouraged hearts to get the spade shift|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: BUT in the other room there was interference by north\|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: still Z gains on this bd|pg||
nt|roswolf: TY 3@c|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jtr: Her|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ralfwil: a fatal @d discard from N|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|po-s: r (was)|pg||
nt|shevek: flat board if -2 here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|janm: After the opening 2@h bid in the other room, North led a spade, so 5@d was down "off the top"|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sunsamvar: so Lavazza need to pull out something on the last board to win this|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: other table led @H 8,  |pg||
nt|tez: i bet he will make 3|pg||
nt|tez: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: clearer|pg||
nt|ritong: @h 7 can come from Q87 i suppose|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will get the clubs now though|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d2|nt|jbgood: that was careless - ruff a spade and throw a club on di king..|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East has the advantage, that he knows the @H King is on-side|pg||
pc|c4|nt|po-s: and may now try the double finesse in spades|pg||
nt|po-s: no?|pg||
nt|ritong: @h 8 can t|pg||
nt|janm: Hard to go right in clubs of course|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  North  can NOT have the @H Ace - in which case he just had played on @S|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: N/S made it easy for Duboin|pg||
nt|janm: But he has!|pg||
nt|peachy: he did it! amazing|pg||
nt|janm: Looked as if he was going to play the club Q and then take the spade finesse if that lost, but he apparently had something else in mind and has done well|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: Seems wrong with no more entries|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ritong: anyways this play is safe|pg||
nt|sybarra: home with a bunch now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|peachy: still, not over yet|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|janm: True, he could still take the spade finesse, but there doesn't seem to be any reason not to try the club A first|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: this is goinbg back and forth    surely east could have cashed A@S and ruffed a sspade and taken a discard on K@D|pg||
nt|jtr: Probably irrelevant to the score|pg||
pc|dT|nt|po-s: yes, but before the secind trump|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West...|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: or the same handful |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ritong: i m told from various sources that polish style is to lead 8 with Q87|pg||
nt|ritong: then @h 7 is clear|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session2.htm scoretables|pg||

pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: score table seems stuck on 35 at present|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Traffic jam in Oxford Street|pg||
nt|jtr: and we seem stuck on 37|pg||
nt|Walddk2: now scores will be frozen, for security purposes I am told|pg||
nt|jtr: ah|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again |pg||
nt|vugraphzcs: E refused to play next board|pg||
nt|jtr: He what?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Err...why?|pg||
nt|jtr: Felt the double was unsporting?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcs: tough situation during prev bidding|pg||
nt|jtr: It was rather....|pg||
nt|vugraphzcs: NS wasn't friendly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But one can't refuse to play, surely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's for the TD to sort out, friendly or not|pg||
nt|xenya: making faces at him?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcs: 60% to NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzcs: that's TD decision|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 0% to EW I assume|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hmm. 100-0 a possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphzcs: no, they don't want to explain their bidding - just gave him CC to read|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's normal to award 60% to the non-offending side for a skipped board|pg||
nt|jtr: 1200 BBO specs are looking for a rebate on their subscription because he wont play|pg||

nt|Walddk2: A ½ IMP may be worth $6,000 |pg||
nt|cuttysark: This looks pretty hideous|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The difference between 1st and 2nd prize|pg||
nt|jtr: Why volunteer 1@s?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Why not pass 1@D doubled?|pg||
nt|jtr: He can pass and bid it over 1@h and they might find 2@d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 IMPs to Zimmermann on 63|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: So Lavazza needs 3 on the last board|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess we cant say though|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|bjacobs: Lavazza's best chance to win will be to double something in the CR|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not impossible|pg||
nt|jtr: Preferably at the 5 level|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Unfortunate that we did not get it right to begin with, but it's beyond BBO's control. However, we apologise profusely|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Make that triple|pg||

nt|sybarra: last hand now (I think) |pg||
nt|shevek: looks like the final will be between Lavazza and Zimmermann|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Q76?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: BZ lead 2nd/4th against Suit & NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: Last board of this set now. Many thanks, to our operator.  A job well done!|pg||
nt|jcwla: Matter of style on the weak 2 -- must have agreement between pds;|pg||
nt|po-s: Zimmermannplayed in French chships last weekend and drew 106-106 afte having had a BIG lead, then lost on total points...|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Seems makeable - 3 NT|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 1 nt or 2@D ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bill Jacobs predicted that 3 days ago. "No need to play quarter-finals and semi-finals", he said|pg||
nt|tejjyid: HI Al, welcome! just in the nick of time|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to all of my co commentators.   We appreciate your time, insights and humor|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: just 2 boards ago i remarked how close the match was:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to our terrific operator in Yokohama,  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: huh??   West really passed 1@S      believe it or not, i'm speechless  ..... starting now|pg||
mb|1D|nt|shevek: anyway close set 19-19|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nice ending of this section|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: they may get to 6@S here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another slam!|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: and of course thx to all of my co commentators  great to have y'all |pg||
nt|larrymori: it was and the slam hand was a huge swing|pg||
nt|po-s: Klinger overcalled 1NT on West....|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: i wouldnt want this auction on my tombstone|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx NEC for bringing this to bbo |pg||
nt|fann4: Missing getting 800 on the previous board cost SouthSweden a vital 4 imps.|pg||
nt|shevek: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|ritong: and anyways, as we said, the play was safe since west can t do no harm even if he gains the lead with @h Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: Our gratitude to the JCBL and to Akito Omasa for brining this wonderful tourney to BBO.  Much appreciated by bridge fans all over the world. |pg||
nt|peachy: Last hand now, Segment 3 of the finals will begin in 1hr 10 min|pg||
nt|shevek: bd 61 has been fixed|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: 2@C or 2@S? |pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!  We love to hear from you :)|pg||
nt|tez: ty all.enjoyed..nice game:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: EW were incredibly lucky to win IMPs on 31|pg||
nt|othered1: I like Fantoni's 2@S in OR|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I prefer 2@C, but I think I'm in  minority with 6-4's|pg||
nt|tez: i like 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: seems to be an Aussie thing to bid NT as often as possible|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: and to our wonderful specs....love the comments|pg||
nt|shevek: thanks to my fellow commentators, Victor and PO|pg||
nt|po-s: right - but those 3 imps on the extra undertrick and the little mistake against 3H on the previous board in the other room made the difference|pg||
nt|roswolf: and a board that may trap someone|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: You must be a good guesser, Hans|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OK, then I'm retiring to Turkey|pg||
nt|tez: :)|pg||
nt|po-s: team included Fantoni Nunes there as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: But with this tame looking board it would not have been enough.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Spade to the ace and a small back|pg||
nt|shevek: a big thank you to our excellent operator, to NEC for staging this great event, and to the JCBL (Akito Omasa)|pg||
nt|shevek: and last but not least thanks to our spectators who give us a reason to be here in the first place|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the bets are on which slam... 6@H,6@S or 6nt|pg||
nt|po-s: will be difficult to get any enthusiasm out og North|pg||
mb|p|nt|larrymori: been noticing that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as if swedes never bid NT:)|pg||
nt|fann4: That's true Marshall, but EW in the OR should not have bid to 5@C.|pg||
nt|po-s: let us see how he guesses spades|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We had a similar bet 3 boards ago...!|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@h by west in OR|pg||
nt|roswolf: the scores shown are UNOFFICIAL|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hawe45:  Sorry - to me makeable means, that is is possible - not SURE|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This one is tough to bid with any accuracy|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: another segment of 16 boards coming up after this last board|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: same contract in both rooms|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: if EW in OR bid 4S instead of 5C, 12 IMPs swing the other way|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks like zimmermann 's trophy then|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fann4: Apparently they will keep this site open for updates on other matches.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: As it is, @S10 is worth gold|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: for me most SUREs are just makeable and most makeable's are down|pg||
nt|po-s: he goes wrong - yes -noo? after the long thought|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He makkes it - there is BBO transmision to NL|pg||
nt|nunes2002: fra 30 minuti inizia il 2° tempo|pg||
nt|po-s: did Duboin consider a diamond back or is he falsecarding the spades|pg||
nt|ralfwil: After that long thought - is it ethical with @sAK?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so an extra undertick will still not matter.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: gib goes 3 down now let see the players|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Congrats Zimmerman and well done Lavazza for a great but futile comeback|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, well done to Pierre Zimmermann, Fulvio Fantoni, Claudio Nunes, Cezary Balicki, Adam Zmudzinski, Franck Multon|pg||
nt|po-s: 3 or 4 down I guess - club back?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tez: what do you thk shirley?2@s or 2@C?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: What time is the next segmetn? quite soon, right?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|po-s: never!|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  30 min|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's raining here today r I'd be gardening|pg||
pc|c2|nt|imp_jan: interesting, duboin's pass on 4@c|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|po-s: and Ish|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Exactly my point Ralf|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: when we played agst them, thought it was 1 club always |pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we see you back in about 15 min |pg||
nt|marlowepi: amazing neither pair bid 4H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks all, back in 30 mins with the second half|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|ralfwil: playing in thew same tempo @sA and a small.....|pg||
nt|po-s: theory being either use the cards God gave you OR don´t become misled beacause you happen to have the ten|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i think Duboin took time to ponder his options bcos Drijver played too fast to trick 1|pg||
nt|ralfwil: does not matter for me...|pg||
nt|po-s: yes, a diamond could haqve been right|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Ok Bye for now and thanls all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now he can't ask for a D control without committing to slam|pg||
nt|odysseus69: much easier if you play control responses to 2 clubs- thew only thing I insist on with all partners|pg||
nt|imp_jan: verhees dbld in almost same position|pg||
nt|Walddk4: so 6@S is a punt|pg||
nt|po-s: setting hearts as trumps is clever - to find out about keycards, then biddin 6S|pg||
pc|sA|nt|peachy: Thank you to Jordan, Andrew, and Jan for their great analysis.  Thank you operator for flawless work. And thank you all kibitzers for your comments, tips, help, and humor!  You are ...|pg||

nt|roswolf: the score shown is UNOFFICIAL there is some doubt about bd 63|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: EW would have lost 6instead of winning 6. that 's the match|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No opening po-s|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|fann4: Roland, is that right about the scores being displayed here?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: night all, thx everybody:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No info Jeff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think next semi-final begins  1 hour 10 minutes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Morning, Marshal :-) tnx and bye|pg||
nt|fann4: Half time scores in the other 3 matches are:|pg||
nt|fann4: ZIMMERMAN 37-7 SARA         NETHERLANDS 53-33 OZ PLAYERS     LAVAZZA 50-18 KENDRICK|pg||
nt|fann4: Operator, will you have the other scores shortly?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and we should add 0.5 imp for team standing higher after Swiss - as conditions of contest say |pg||
nt|Walddk4: If the Zimmermann advance, they select opponents for the SF |pg||
nt|ahollan1: anybody want to bet AGAINST  Zimmerman & Lavazza advancing?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but with such gaps, half imp doesn't matter|pg||
nt|Walddk4: One would assume that they do not choose Lavazza|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lavazza beat Zimmerman  46-21 in Round 7 of the qualifying Swiss|pg||
nt|fann4: Scores coming thru' in a moment|pg||
nt|Walddk4: NL defeated Oz|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Lavazza defeated Kendrick|pg||

nt|roswolf: yup bye all|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 64 boards and a tie|pg||
nt|po-s: small ruff, and we would be waiting for scrutiny of scorecards|pg||
nt|shevek: a couple of claims might be wrong, I'm told|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed i think the scorere will decide this!!!|pg||
nt|shevek: we might keep the table open for a while operator?|pg||
nt|shevek: wow|pg||
nt|po-s: but Duboin ruffe with the queen so they need to gind 4 imps|pg||
nt|shevek: adjustments in place|pg||
nt|roswolf: lookws like the coffee worked|pg||
nt|roswolf: well done to LAVAZZA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Unfortunate that we did not get it right to begin with, but it's beyond BBO's control. However, we apologise profusely|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes scores corrected|pg||
nt|roswolf: great entertainment|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Lavazza by 2 confirmed by our other operator, but ....|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's still not official|pg||
nt|po-s: Poor Zimmermann, leaving good leads to his pro sqads twice in a week.....|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This lead was only 10, though|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup should play more himself maybe!?:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Was 54 last Saturday|pg||
nt|po-s: wasn´t it around 40?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No. 54 last week, 10 now|pg||
nt|po-s: after set 1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh, that far back, yes|pg||
nt|po-s: I thought he played the first two but perhaps not|pg||
nt|mwigor: according to the website he sat out set one and played set two|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye all|pg||
nt|drewsky: A pair of pros losing a huge lead in bridge is not neccesarily thei fault as they are usually playing against other pros or peers of equal ability|pg||
nt|po-s: sorry, apologies to his crew...|pg||
nt|drewsky: As a matter of fact, the top 16 seeds in our USA national knockouts are ALL sponsored teams !|pg||
