nt|sybarra: tourney web site |pg||
nt|peachy: and off we go, enjoy the match|pg||
nt|sybarra: great misfit to begin with |pg||
nt|peachy: the tournament website did not have them unless I completely missed it|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|chick: probably play in a NT partscore somewhere|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Morning from DK - and doÂ´nt get surprised, if E/W will start with 420 - og maybe 450, depending on the lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|marlowepi: misfit perhaps but very close to 3N|pg||
nt|chick: or 2@C :)|pg||
nt|peachy: or 3|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|peachy: i would certainly raise clubs as S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N by N would make|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|chick: 3N doesn't look very makeable to me, but I'm sure you're right :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Conservative view by Sally Brock here opposite 15-17, but it often pays off at matchpoints|pg||
nt|marlowepi: natural diamond lead from E, two rounds of clubs, over fast|pg||
nt|peachy: 5C happens to make also, right?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: y|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: very good auction|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: N appreciates his primey hand|pg||
nt|peachy: found the best place|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|chick: pretty amazing lead :)|pg||
nt|peachy: tricky lead...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: logical lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N marked with heart shortness|pg||
nt|peachy: heart indicated by auction, so what can he do, ignore logic, but it is still ricky...|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|peachy: tricky :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes  gutsy move |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: And there is no game in spades, what about notrumps?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and no more trumps |pg||
nt|chick: certainly solves the problem of the diamond loser, so it was a no-risk finesse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she just has to decide which red suit to finesse. heart hook also logiocal--if E had D card but no heart card, probably a D lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html       tourney site|pg||
nt|peachy: i think best the diamonds before getting to board with S ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well if there are 2 trump losers and D queen is on but heart king off, it is not no risk--it goes down in a makeable contract|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S-return kept West in 420 |pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: North will likely put dummy back in|pg||
nt|hlortz: even if e transfers and bids 2n, w likely to pass with 15 and no @S fit|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: Right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, it's a very good 15 count with a strong 5-card suit|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1N!|nt|Walddk2: 2@C for the majors. She has her bid :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I think, we should recommand a part score here|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: 3-loser hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another possible slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: correct play makes it|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: even on best lead of D ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: may be forced to play correctly no entry to dummy |pg||
nt|marlowepi: D king|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  SouthÂ´s 2 @S must be a minimum-hand...|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in clubs dummy has about 6 entries|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But only a @S-lead is good for the defense|pg||
pc|s2|nt|peachy: oops|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry I was talking about 2 @S |pg||
pc|s4|nt|jbgood: i'd rather double 2@c than 4 @h|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: NS do quite well in diamonds, but the club break is awkward|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: never said it was easy to get to slam:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hlortz: the 4-0 trump break will beat this i think|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jbgood: an unlucky downer (2?)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, with @hs 4-0 and North with a doubleton @s This wont be nice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can consider yourself very unlucky to go two down opposite four trumps|pg||
nt|hlortz: s taps the dummy to shut out the long spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: From Brock's point of view I mean|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session1.htm  for standings after session 1|pg||

pc|c2|nt|sfoxa:  it doesn't seem like big result for EW - they could win 5@c|pg||

pc|c7|pc|s9|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|sT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So 670 due to bad defense from East, who coukd also defeat the contract by rising sith the @C King|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|andyv:  3@s just can't be right... why is S in such a rush to show a bad suit?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: it stil is joined to Europe, it's just that part of the way is under water|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club lead would give declarer a chance to go down|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Nice for once to see instant scoring outside Scandinavia and Poland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can we hope for America to follow suit?|pg||
nt|hlortz: in 10 or 20 years|pg||

nt|peachy: not opening lead|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|jtr: What do we think of West's 2NT though?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  N/S should have played trumps from the very beginning|pg||

pc|sK|nt|peachy: Might have been wise to cash HA, it could disappear on the club|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h2|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|jbgood: served its purpose: getting a plus score|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jtr: Yes fair point|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, it did, but it possibly should not have done|pg||
nt|jtr: If you dont give decisions the opponents dont have the opportunity for mistakes|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|hawe45:  South had 2 @D - North 5.... |pg||
nt|peachy: Teramoto probably hard counting everything|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|andyv:  declarer will have to decide whether to finesse in spades... if it's on, the 5@d bidders will all be making 6|pg||

nt|peachy: but|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  and if it's off, you are down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently the pair that played 27 in 5@D did it against the leaders, which will do them no harm |pg||

nt|sybarra: I guess I would ask if you sit for the X on the N hand |pg||
mb|1D|nt|hawe45:  West is lucky here - a Multi would nok be a success|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I mean - South opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in the unlikely event that i passed originally as E, i doubt i could bring myself to pass 4S when pd bids it facing a passed hand at unfavorable vul with an unlinmited hand behind ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: him. if i did summon such conservatism, and then watched 4S go down, i'd head for the bar|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|peachy: not much of fit anywhere|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And in 3 NT, you must hunt the 9th trick|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|marlowepi: S passes another opening bid by many standards|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm, if the suits were majors I'd open.|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I'd open S at any vul|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it would be better to have the minors reversed, but you cant have everything all the time|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has an interesting problem over 1H. i dont think 2H gets the job done. prefer 3H|pg||
nt|peachy: splinter would be my choice|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|Walddk4: Maybe someone in the audience can tell us what 2@D is|pg||
nt|peachy: club position fortunate|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: might even keep West out  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: which would in your book be weaker, Pass or 4D by N over 3H?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Anyone for a double of 4@H at MP?|pg||

nt|jtr: If we make 3@s|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: You'll get 200 here, though|pg||
nt|sybarra: although on k of @S lead,  anything over 4 is unattrative |pg||
pc|d8|nt|peachy: ok, maybe S should have opened, this is madness|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W would probably have liked to show spade values, but hard to do that without concealinbg the heart support, and there is likely to be no convenient time later to show support|pg||
nt|marlowepi: making|pg||
nt|marlowepi: clubs ruff up for 3 discards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now W will REALLYYYYYYYY wish he had shown spade values:)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 3 spades, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds, 2 clubs    at least|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 diamonds possible|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And probably only 1 club|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Discarding the @D 8 more or less denies the position of the King|pg||
nt|peachy: probably best to go after clubs, need some of them any way|pg||
nt|peachy: I mean first|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I vote for a small @D now!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The tables are not linked I'm afraid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 630 is the score on 7 in the open room|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jtr: Not 500?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not if they don't double|pg||
nt|jtr: oh right  i see|pg||
nt|hlortz: i'd rather bid 3@H the 1st round. - no not a splinter :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think this N-S pair plays weak jump shifts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@H seems a bit of a punt with a queen-high hand|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The wrong singleton for a start one could say|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hlortz: well weak jump shifts would realte to 2@H  3@H either weak or a splinter|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hawe45:  West is forced to play @C - and South will make his living by establishing the 5th @D|pg||

nt|marlowepi: S took a line of play that could never succeed there|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm rooting for the Netherlands to get on the scoreboard|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hawe45:  They might be there after board 7 - but we need OR-result|pg||

pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: Saved |pg||
pc|s9|nt|andyv:  lots of rescuing done today|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S absolutely needed trumps 22 because one club had to be ruffed to set up the suit, and later a spade had to be ruffed. if Ds are 3-1 the hand cant make|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|hlortz: little did wwest know a spade preference was coming on his left|pg||

pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: doubling 2@H is an option|pg||

pc|c3|nt|peachy: no chance, without def erring|pg||
