nt|drorp:  and after making a huge 3rd segment comeback :)|pg||
nt|djneill: hi Dror and David, I'm late to this but I did see that amazing comeback against Zimmerman yesterday by Delfour|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: West is good for 2@S, with four-card trump support. He will bid game now.|pg||

nt|brolucius: West realised that he had a good hand and makes a splinter bid in case his partner is enormous with nothing much wasted in clubs.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|drorp:  yep his hand is really almost best possible for 2@S|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Funny how easy things are from up here|pg||

nt|drorp:  now a diamond ruff with Q and declearer has a bit of a guess|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|djneill: is that a form of restricted choice|pg||
pc|s2|nt|djneill: restricted choice of course is when one of equivalent cards (honors) is played perforce, it tends to deny the other one, or maybe that's too simple but that's how I remember it :-)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|c5|pg||

pc|cK|pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's a little bit tricky, because North would have to decide whether to ruff at all with Q-J. With that holding, he would probably have scored a trump trick anyway, if declarer ...|pg||

mb|3S|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Here is a coffee hand for all of us. NS will get their two aces in 3NT|pg||
nt|djneill: or maybe he would for that reason, etc, it goes back and forth, if he can read the situation - in general he would not since there are other situations where it would just tempt pd ...|pg||
nt|djneill: to make a mistake, e.g if East had just 2 hearts and North Hxx and ruffed it low, losing a natural trick|pg||
nt|djneill: anyways, here, West chooses to double 3S, rather than bid 4@h with just 5 cards, but they are good|pg||
nt|brolucius: West does not like to risk 4@H. A double gives partner the chance to pass or bid 3NT if he wishes.|pg||
nt|brolucius: North considering a spade raise.|pg||
nt|djneill: Should North do it?|pg||

nt|vugraphzxr: For the french commentary is Philippe Cronier and Vincent Combeaux|pg||
nt|drorp:  K@S isn't worth anything, so 5@H is enough|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, East probably needed some thought before bidding 5@H.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: 4NT should be natural; with club support you just support or bid 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Palau wasn't sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's hardly a triumph to be in 5@D. It goes down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe West can bid 5@S now as a transfer to 5NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not kidding|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: A slow 5NT is not the way to do it|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|djneill: "nice dummy, pd, thank you!"|pg||
nt|brolucius: With a singleton spade in dummy, North's signal will have been suit-preference. He played a low card - for clubs.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Laure is a very meticulous operator, so she will not (and should not) enter bids until both players have bid|pg||
pc|c5|nt|drorp:  Thomas is still thinking if slam is possible, or if 5@C might be a better contract, but he should realize that 3NT is best spot opposite a partner who has strengh in @D|pg||
nt|djneill: here, East can eliminate all the suits but clubs and can choose to play either side for the cK potentially, but once East finds South with 1@h and 3@d, it's 100% to play the @cA ...|pg||
nt|djneill: and another, if South has the @cK it is doubleton and he is endplayed|pg||
nt|djneill: or take the club switch :-)|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|drorp:  can W bid?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|djneill: North scrapes up a 1@c opening, East doubles since too strong for a simple 1@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp:  so he'll get to play 2@H instead :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: A double followed by a change of suit shows a big hand, so 2@H adequate at this stage.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What did you çay, David?|pg||
nt|djneill: so, pass 2@h for a 5-1 fit, or bid higher to show a few HCP|pg||
nt|drorp:  west might be tempted but his hand is bad, even opposite a 20 count game is not very likley to make|pg||
mb|3C|nt|fokal: guillamin 'S 1@s shows 0-7 so he is kind of maximum now|pg||
nt|drorp:  wow, game forced, now they're in trouble|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C seems a bit much with a singleton heart.|pg||
nt|djneill: the @dJ is potentially a huge waste|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp:  4@s is the least worse spot now|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|fokal: but sg @h in the other hand|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Impossible for Guillaumin to know that he has the right cards for game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Since 2@H was non-forcing, 3@S is known to be on three-card support.|pg||

nt|fokal: won't be cheap|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mercifully undoubled|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer is unlucky. He has the 4-3 heart break that he needed, but there are a few high cards missing in the dummy.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: A pre-empt usually does not include a void, although anything is possible in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|drorp:  yes, would've bid on with 3 hearts fit, but now was impossible|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|c3|pg||
nt|fokal: otherwise they might end up in 4@s much more difficult to defeat|pg||

nt|fokal: agree with dror|pg||

nt|cicus: yes, S did not fancy playing 2@H X-ed|pg||
nt|henryb:  and can Michel then realize that all his cards are working|pg||
nt|henryb:  including the 109 of spades|pg||
nt|cicus: S bid out his hand quite cheaply|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have just started to read a new book that suggests a 5-4-3-2-1 point-count for the honour cards, including the 10. This is aimed at the bidding of balanced hands. It is true that ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: aces are over-valued when two balanced hands face each other, and queen and jacks are under-valued. The trouble with a new valuation scheme is that it falls apart when partner does ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: not have a balanced hand too. The author recommends opening on three Q-J combinations, for example.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Did you eat a humble pie, Mike? |pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did prefer clubs over diamonds before|pg||
nt|cicus: nor can I S's pass when N has already given preference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would he change his mind?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think Michel would have been bettwe off jumping to 4@c|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, it is much harder to add up the points in your hand. "I had an interesting 42-count the other day..."|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cicus: I agree|pg||
nt|brolucius: There are 60 points in the pack instead of 40.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Of course the author is dead right about the honours being inaccurately values at NT. When you have fifteen points opposite ten, all aces and kings, there is usually very poor play ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: for 3NT.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: wellnow w have no spade lead and lets see what the great Nunes can do|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: Spade/diamond squeeze against West I suppose|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|brolucius: East is playing 4@S in the Closed Room, I am told.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: 3@D was an attempt to show a feature and excellent club fit by a hand who passed 1@C. I can follow Michel's way of thinking|pg||
nt|henryb:  I can also. But 4@c after the initial pass and minimum preference would also be clear|pg||
nt|cicus: I prefer to send clear messages. 4@C would have been best, now that NT is out of the question|pg||
nt|cicus: the trouble with 3@D is that it feels natural|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I wouldn't try it on a pick-up partner, but NS have been partners for a very long time, and a successful one|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is useful for the vugraph aidience as it makes the match much closer|pg||

nt|henryb:  So would 4@c, no?|pg||
nt|brolucius: The West hand is good for a 3@D opening in the third seat, not in the first seat.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: well how exacly should he have played this Roland?|pg||
nt|lestergold: he appears to have played for @sK with west|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The existing squeeze failed because he could not reach the squeeze card, a club, because he had not ruffed a diamond in time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not obvious which squeeze to play for|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This set is breathtaking, I need a Valium, brb|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but it does not show a diamond card|pg||
nt|henryb:  But I agree; 3@d should have been successful|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D does|pg||
nt|cicus: maybe 3@D was theoretically better but we can see that practically it wasn't ...|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|brolucius: A diamond raise may help N/S to bid their hands to the limit.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Not that they want to, with that heart break.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  One of the advantages of Blackwood is that you can avoid slams off two key cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp:  6@H is about 90% but here is the 10% that it fails :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: That was the problem with East intorducing the spades. He eventually had no chance to show his diamond support.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|lestergold: we need a coffe hand after that|pg||

nt|lestergold: spec asks about east's double feels east has a natural 2D bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fair point|pg||

nt|vugraphzxr: smoking break here !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: NS are in 6@H next door|pg||
nt|cicus: it takes up too much space so it must carry a well-defined message|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bid over 5@S|pg||
nt|drorp:  Hi again|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello Dror, wb|pg||
nt|cicus: good save as 5@S makes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Palau had no other option|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C was not game-forcing and 3@S later would be slammy|pg||
nt|cicus: I am warned that N has no clubs so on a club lead 5@S is -2, thanks|pg||
nt|drorp:  5@S could be set on founding the @C ruff (not too hard), but anyway 6@h-1 isn't a bad score|pg||
nt|henryb:  If so, it shows a system limitation, I think. |pg||
nt|cicus: -1, that is|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@C is here 15+ balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do they smoke cigars?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: we are back :|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Returning to the previous hand, I would not be ashamed to make a non-forcing bid with 11HCP, three trumps and no aces|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh no, Chemla was knocked out yesterday|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: lol|pg||
nt|brolucius: The N/S cards were very difficult to bid, on the last board. North had great shape but his trumps were 9-high so he did not want to be too enthusiastic.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chmitty: now they bid 4@s|pg||
nt|drorp:  didn't like the 4@H bid in the other room, but 3@S also seems like an overbid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S splinter in support of hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: can they make ?|pg||
nt|cicus: 3@S a bit of an overbid but 2@S does not feel right|pg||
nt|drorp:  now N isn't stopping, 6@H is the minimum he'll play|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: 2@C a sound spade raise presumably|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp:  good bid by W, he knows he's going to 4@S anyway so he shows his suit on the way|pg||
nt|cicus: EW may even save in 6@S|pg||
nt|drorp:  this exact 4@C bid should prevent E from sacrificng|pg||
nt|henryb:  wow. not only 4@c but 4@s as well by west. They mist play VERY sound vulnerable overcalls|pg||
nt|brolucius: They play strong notrumps, so the 1NT rebid is weak.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|drorp:  once he bid 4@c, he knew he'll bid 4@S, otherwise he would just bid 3@S|pg||
nt|drorp:  thomas should X now if it's forcing pass situation (i think it is)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|chmitty: yes he will make|pg||
nt|chmitty: if defence plays @s then he can easily play @h from dummy to the queen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have a match if he does|pg||
nt|cicus: Michel could have tried 5@C as a lead director just in case of|pg||
nt|henryb:  I understand, but driving to 4@s on the West hand seems like a lot!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Agree Gábor, 5@C would have been a clever bid|pg||
nt|cicus: W did not have the right to bid 3@S|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps he had enough of clever bids with 3@d a few boards ago?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: just for remind you 3 segments of 16 boards for the finals|pg||
nt|cicus: N is endplayed into bidding 6@H now|pg||
nt|drorp:  i can't see N not bidding 6@H here, knowing it's atmost 1 off|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: I bet we have one Roland :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Who would have thought that before this set started?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@D denies three-card spade support, so South settles for 3NT.|pg||
nt|drorp:  I'm guessing that 2@C forced the 2@D bid and 3NT showed 5-3-3-2 hand|pg||
nt|drorp:  because if 2@C was normal CB, why wouldn't N bid 2@H?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Some were surprised that Delfour did not concede|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that 2@D also denies a maximum of 14 points. Thanks for that info.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cicus: belated lead director|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He had to bid. For all he knows both 5@S and 6@H could be making|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chmitty: take in dummy and play @h presumably|pg||
nt|drorp:  exactly, in imps the odds are very much in favour of bidding on at these kinds of huge fits|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Wrong tactics by Palau methinks|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|drorp:  wow... bad save didn't he think he has 2 tricks? (@S+@D)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would 6@H make with the cards he has?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @DK seems useful|pg||
nt|cicus: hard decision. was not sure of @SA making a trick|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: Natural move|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need a little luck to make this and find it|pg||
nt|drorp:  a@S must make a trick imo, how can north bid 4@H with void|pg||
nt|drorp:  south*|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thomas' bidding does not imply that he is void in spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Agree with Dror|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: And Michel can't be void in *two* suits|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Laure, did the director come back with a ruling on board 3?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: no|pg||
nt|Walddk2: mci|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: Can they imagine at this table that the match is so close ? What do you think Roland, I missed the first boards ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes they can|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6NT making off 2 aces is just one of many good boards for E-W|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@H is another, not obvious to be in it|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry had phone call|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: he is still thinking about it :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: brb im gonna make that coffee |pg||
pc|sT|pc|d5|nt|brolucius: Maybe North did not bid 2@H because they do not want to give away that information every time. It is up to South to look for a heart fit over 2@D (or 2NT to show 14) if South does ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: indeed hold four hearts as well as five spades.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|cicus: I could not come up with anny other explanation|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, I am told that the method is called Roudi(nesco) and: answer apre codified : 2@d= mini misfit, 2@h = mini fit ,2@s = maxi fit 2NT maxi misfit|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see. Well, they must have some method to find a 4-4 heart fit as well.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|chmitty: Quantin psyched 1NT and played there|pg||
nt|lestergold: how many hands left pleas asks spec?|pg||
nt|drorp:  grand slam time|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that 3NT by the Roudi bidder denies four hearts. Well, I am sure we have all heard everything we want to know about that! |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 16 is the last board|pg||
nt|chmitty: 7 boards left|pg||
nt|lestergold: thx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Laydown grand slam now. Feinscheckers would of course bid 7NT and make it on a squeeze|pg||
mb|1C|nt|chmitty: plenty of time|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: 10 extra points for style :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: There is play for 6@S but it is unlikely they will stretch that far.|pg||
nt|drorp:  4@S here, slam might appear to make but there are not enough tricks because spades are 3-0 and clubs 5-2|pg||
nt|brolucius: A ruffing finesse in clubs provides discards for the two heart losers in the north hand.|pg||
nt|drorp:  anyay bidding slam seems very hard|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: You can always see that by clicking on MOVIE|pg||
nt|chmitty: stay with us :) lol|pg||
mb|2C|nt|fokal: 6@s doesn't make on @h lead I think|pg||
mb|4D|nt|vugraphzxr: Thomas said we have to hurry up .. the director is happy .. he doesn'thave to work|pg||
nt|drorp:  3@D now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I see, the breaks are bad.|pg||
nt|drorp:  i play 4@D as showing void|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp:  i'm not sure squeeze plays there, west has 87X diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: oops, that may be enough|pg||
nt|drorp:  and double squeeze won't work because east discards after dummy|pg||
mb|4S|nt|chmitty: they may play in 3NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Michel's fault for not having @D8|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp:  anyway, i can't see how they won't bid the grand slam on a non interrupted bidding (very surprised they didn't at the other room)|pg||
nt|drorp:  N has a good hand opposite splinter, 3 small cards and 2 extra spades, but still his hand is too weak to do anything|pg||
mb|5D|nt|chmitty: they do|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm points there sadly heart guard a little duplicated|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If only Palau does not get funny ideas ....|pg||
nt|chmitty: will Palau imagine his partner holds 4 cards in @h later in the play ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: honest palooka certainly takes this off without effort|pg||
nt|drorp:  i expect him to bid 5@S now|pg||
mb|5S|nt|lestergold: and so does Palau|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not over just yet|pg||
nt|chmitty: now ... he knows thar Fantoni hols all the big cards ... so no other hope|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Paau will have to read his partner's count|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1900 specs will get it down, but we are not playing|pg||
nt|chmitty: Guillaumin will play the 9 and is supposed to produce a Smith echo later on|pg||
nt|chmitty: let's see|pg||
nt|chmitty: if this partnership can do it|pg||
nt|lestergold: well south must play q and west will give the biggest signal their methods will allow|pg||
nt|chmitty: they signal with the 2nd highest card|pg||
nt|lestergold: we know that there are often ambiguities in this position even wit a reg pard|pg||
nt|chmitty: on top of that if Fantoni plays the Queen, he denies the ten in hand ....|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chmitty: and then the 9 has to come from 109xx|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: hummmm|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if that doesnt scream things from the roof tops! could it ve fronm Ten x|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe this will be interpreted as values in spades, but West can't really have any points on this auction, can he?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well is ther any other hope in any case?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni must be maximum for his leap to 3NT opposite a 2@H range asking|pg||
nt|lestergold: shouldnt on the lead be suit preference priority is to show information in the known long asuit buid and led|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT in the balancing seat shows 11-15 for them|pg||
nt|chmitty: Palau knows Fantoni can't hold K107x ... he would hace ducked from dummy|pg||
nt|chmitty: I mean K98x|pg||
nt|lestergold: well as east will get more than one bite of the cherry its onconceivabl that this contract will make|pg||
nt|chmitty: K97x :) lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What would PYG have played from 109x or 10xx   a low one?|pg||
nt|chmitty: yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: Apart from the bad breaks, East's strength-showing cuebid might have caused declarer to play the clubs incorrectly.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|drorp:  but west made a strengh showing overcall :)|pg||
nt|drorp:  he should get it right, surely after the lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: West has shown diamonds and East has shown strength. It's true that East has now revealed the top heart honors.|pg||
nt|brolucius: On some deals, the ruffing finesse is better because you can take one discard as you pass the @CQ. That does not apply here because you would still have three losers if the @CQ was ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: run to the @CK with East.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, if you go for the ruffing finesse, you can sometimes take a club ruff or two first (perhaps bringing down the @CK in either hand).|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chmitty: no other choice|pg||
nt|lestergold: will level the score |pg||
nt|chmitty: the 10 of @c : I have @h@h@h@h@h|pg||
pc|h3|nt|drorp:  hmm they don't know about the stiff @H yet, N will have to blast the grand now|pg||

nt|drorp:  okay then...|pg||
nt|drorp:  k@C is marked now i think, if west had only AKJTxx @D he wouldn't overcall 1@D, he would bid 3@D|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't agree with that, really. Why not mentiond A-K-x-x-x at the one-level. Not so valuable in diamonds, it is true.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: or 6@D fishing for a H control|pg||

nt|drorp:  yes, but the point is, with shape, and 0 points in all suits but diamonds, he would try to do a bit more of a mess on his 1st bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: We were due an interesting board, and that was it!|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|brolucius: Yes, I see what you mean. You would have made the contract and Michel Bessis did not!|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|mb|3H|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: 1@H can be weaker than 14 in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With 4 spades oin the side it shows 11-13|pg||
nt|chmitty: remember in the Fantunes system, the 1@h opening is 14+|pg||
nt|lestergold: not expecting any hreat swing on this board|pg||
nt|henryb:  6@h is a reasonable contract. certainly better than 4@s, although it too would be down 1|pg||
nt|drorp:  game try X|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not with 4 spades|pg||
mb|3S|nt|chmitty: so will be in game most probably|pg||
nt|drorp:  east has a tough bid, 4 spades and 8 count but his points are really bad, still, i think i'd bid 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chmitty: sry, he was in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1H in third surely some leeway|pg||
nt|lestergold: if game is bid might well make on the dim lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14+ (good 12/13) 5+ hearts, OR  11-13 if 5H and 4S|pg||
nt|chmitty: you right :) of course ... then he has a maximum ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: IN that context yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: looking at the two hands 4H doe snotlike like an appetising contract especilly nv|pg||
nt|chmitty: that's why he is thinking though|pg||
nt|chmitty: despite the original pass by South|pg||
nt|drorp:  W at the other table chose 3@D as the rebid, very unsuccsessful, 2NT will work better as they'll find the @H fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: now how will Nunes evaluate his borderline hand here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: aceless wonder no stffies|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is super max for his initial pass|pg||
nt|drorp:  because of the 4th spade|pg||
pc|cT|nt|chmitty: he could have the @s10 lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: qx dims does notlook like its pulling its weight|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: With a jack he would have opened a weak NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://psbridge.gotdns.com/bbo/allvug/  - Vugraph Hand Records (PDF)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|drorp:  3@D transfer to @H i guess|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s6|nt|chmitty: no swing here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|henryb:  well bid by E-W|pg||
nt|cicus: tis is certainly better than 4@S|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|drorp:  great 2NT rebid imo|pg||
nt|henryb:  although slam on a 3-2 trump break is really not unreasonable|pg||
nt|drorp:  exactly for the reason of leaving a chance to find the possible @H fit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Gazzilli would also work like a dream on this hand|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: yes he has signed off nothing more to say and North certainly has bid the pips off his own hand so no excitement|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: the director is around the table|pg||
pc|h7|nt|henryb:  the overtrick is worth an imp|pg||
nt|drorp:  so some imps back after 2 terrible boards for Delfour team|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cicus: 1 trump then @CK|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|cicus: risks going down if they can make their 3 remaining trumps separately, if spades are 6-0 and @Ds 4-1|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Sorry if I offend anyone, but this is what you deserve for overcalling. Partner leads away from Kx|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|chmitty: true Roland, but he had a passed hand|pg||
nt|chmitty: was tempting to compete|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
pc|sT|nt|chmitty: The director is Claude Dadoun, very clever and experimented|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: no is not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't agree, Pierre. 2@D makes no sense. It's not your hand when RHO bids 2@C, so if you overall, et least have a decent suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: M Chevalier|pg||
nt|lestergold: in these situations especially part score I do not automatically lead partner's suit when I hold A or K unsupported |pg||
nt|Walddk2: No-one asked West to come in at the 2-level, so when he did, it must because he is dying for a D lead, is it not?|pg||
nt|lestergold: an overcall idelly should be man things including lead directional but unfortunately it doesnt guarantee to be all these things|pg||
nt|lestergold: I sympathise because god gave us six card suits to create havoc with|pg||

nt|vugraphzxr: Hi David|pg||
nt|brolucius: What happened to Fantoni-Nunes? Did they lose yesterday? They had a big lead when I was commentating.|pg||
nt|cicus: 12 tricks?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They lost all 54 IMPs and were out on total points|pg||
nt|drorp:  You picked the wrong segment to commentate then :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They also failed to cash two aces against 6NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Wow! They did have a few bad boards (surprising ones) even when I was watching. Missed a small slam where 13 tricks were on a finesse against the trump king.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The East hand was packed with queens and jacks.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|cicus: 1NT?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: I approve|pg||
nt|drorp:  yep, not much choice with 5@C and 4@D|pg||
nt|henryb:  It is always allowed to open 1@c with that hand.|pg||
nt|cicus: I'd bid Landy here then some number of @Hs|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|lestergold: 12 unopposed bids to go totally overboard on a misfitting 26 combined miltons .... vetry strange|pg||
nt|drorp:  just like other table did|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would never show 4-7 as a two-suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp:  i like this idea, you're not afraid to go on the 3 level even on a misfit|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: By the way, this is the genuine perfume hand, 4711, Kölnisches Wasser|pg||
nt|cicus: sometimes it helps to involve partner in the decision|pg||
nt|brolucius: Before I was (rudely) disconnected, I was going to say that the South hand was difficult express. I see that Thomas has taken teh same route as they did at the other table.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think this should be a game try in spades|pg||
nt|henryb:  and not 4-7|pg||
nt|cicus: if he's had @SK instead of @DK, game would be odds-on|pg||
nt|brolucius: He can bid 3@S for the game try.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also known as Eau de Cologne|pg||
nt|drorp:  why won't 2N, 3@C, 3@D be game try in @S?|pg||
nt|drorp:  or, 3@S as david says :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I think 3@H should show longer hearts.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxr: changement de leader !!!!! amaising !!|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: now er that seems 4 bids to getto a normal contract rather than 12 to go to broadmoor|pg||
nt|drorp:  i think he showed his hand pretty well|pg||
nt|drorp:  4-6, 4-7 with game try values|pg||
nt|brolucius: Since partner has given preference to the higher suit, he will have at least one card more there. So, you would need two cards extra in hearts to suggest that as a trump suit.|pg||
nt|henryb:  what would you do with 5-6-1-1 and a decent hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: er sorry for foreign specs broadmoor is where in england we send our criminally insane|pg||
nt|drorp:  probably 4@S :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  you are young|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: Guillaumin would prefer the first @d to go to North, but how can he achieve that ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: @s to dummy ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: but you need the @s ace as a communication|pg||
nt|drorp:  same bidding as the closed room|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brolucius: Tim Bourke makes the good point to me that 3@H might be a better start. When you are 7-4 you rarely want to play in the four-card trump suit.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am old and have already gone down enough in my lifetime :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Haven't we all?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or put it another way. What do you call AQ109654?|pg||
nt|drorp:  so you could bid 3@S, with 6-5 why would you bid 3@H|pg||
nt|henryb:  trumps???|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: You need some way to show longer hearts and 2@C then 3@H is the only one available.|pg||
nt|drorp:  it's true that 7-4 is a single suiter, but when you're strong enough to describe your hand there is no reason not to do it, here he would find an easy 4@S game opposite Kxxxx@S and nothing else|pg||
nt|cicus: on club leads S will have to start both majors from hand, so only 9 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  and if North held Kxxx of spades and a stiff heart we would be applauding the choice of Landy|pg||
nt|cicus: in fact even 9 is lucky|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and what if Partner passes 2@C, Dror? It has happened you know|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brolucius: Easy for East to read South for the singleton diamond after he has shown such length in the majors.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe North has KQ or KJ or QJ or KQJ so that he has to win the diamond anyway|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h7|nt|chmitty: he can play @s Jack and duck again :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Laure never makes an error, slip of the hand maybe, but not an error|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: ihihihihih|pg||
nt|chmitty: now he has a chance of @c33 @s 33 or any kind and much more in @d or @h|pg||

pc|c2|nt|cicus: S might still lose a spade if fails to cash @SQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's @S4 was not a very clear signal, whatever it meant. From x-x-x-x, it seems better to play the lowest or the second-highest, according to whether you want to signal high or ...|pg||

nt|brolucius: On the 5@S deal, at the other table, East opened 1@H and the bidding stopped in 4@S. East held @HK-Q-J-x-x and an A-J-x, so very reasonable to open, but it did not work out ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: luckily. |pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|brolucius: 3@D too much now on the South cards (if forcing).|pg||

nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
mb|d|nt|cicus: an unlucky slam|pg||

nt|brolucius: East did well to bid up because of his fitting diamond cards.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|chmitty: Cabanes was a bit optimistic with his 3@h bid indeed|pg||
nt|henryb:  6@s is a decent enough contract, and GIB would make it|pg||

nt|lestergold: so some of the lost lead recaptured here|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: So would we all, Henry|pg||
nt|brolucius: West should have done more than 4@S.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With all cards in view|pg||
pc|c6|nt|brolucius: OK, he was facing a passed hand, but no damage in saying that his own hand (which had also been limited) was very slam suitable.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brolucius: The fact that East at the other table went for 1100 when overcalling 2@H on a seven-card suit explains why it is recommended that you do not make such bids on a five-card suit.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|chmitty: I mean 3@c sry|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|henryb:  6@s needs either spades to come in or the @d finesse, Well above 50%|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 12-14|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|henryb:  ah. a ruff|pg||
nt|drorp:  indeed, he was already out for 500 here, the Q@S play was the error|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Fant has master suit |pg||
nt|brolucius: Another 3NT that would be bid if you upgraded the value of Qs and Js. Ah, North has opened a strong 1NT.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzxr: je vous rappelle que la demie finale se joue en 3 segments de 16 donnes|pg||
nt|cicus: but 6NT is OK|pg||
nt|henryb:  scary but fine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sure, great contract|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well if Fantoni reads the cards her may well make|pg||
nt|lestergold: but communcation is dire|pg||
nt|chmitty: can he ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can't but he may|pg||
nt|chmitty: @c now, then two rounds of @s and a third @c|pg||
nt|cicus: hehe|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, good bidding.|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp:  wow 2@H, i'd bid 2@C with that (actually i'd bid 2N, but assuming i don't have it avaliable)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At least it's better than the 6NT yesterday off two aces|pg||
nt|drorp:  he upgraded his kings :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|brolucius: Again South had a chance to cue-bid but (rightly) declined to do so with no points in either major (where the length was).|pg||
nt|brolucius: Added a point for the good diamonds.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|lestergold: first hurdle but that was not too difficult|pg||
nt|chmitty: cant't make 4@h if they remove the entry|pg||
nt|brolucius: North has 19 points and South has 15, using the recommended 5-4-3-2-1. (If I have got it wrong it just makes my points as to how difficult it is to add up your points on the new ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: scheme).|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dT|nt|brolucius: It will never catch on.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: kill that entry now!|pg||
nt|lestergold: will surely do that|pg||
nt|chmitty: defence has 3@s 3@c and a @d|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: as kit also sets up club trick|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is bad enough when players use different versions of the same convention. Imagine if half the players in the world started to use a different point-count system.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|nt|chmitty: and 7 tricks for the defence ... means 1NT does not make|pg||
nt|chmitty: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like a push|pg||
nt|lestergold: well thats bwhy roland likes 20/20 hands tends to mean that the declaring side often goes neg|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure what they are doing in the event of a tie. Maybe 8 extra boards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do you know, Pierre?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|chmitty: I have no idea Roland :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: I look for it|pg||

pc|c5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|cicus: now S may worry|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|brolucius: If South reads the opening lead as a singleton, there is something to be said for playing a trump to the king. On the basis that if East holds the trump ace you will lose a ruff ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: anyway. No doubt that is what declarer did at the other table.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|henryb:  easy, though. cash the other diamond and play a club|pg||
nt|cicus: oh, there is an endplay with clubs, I missed that, thanks to the many specs|pg||
nt|drorp:  great duck i think he's down now|pg||

nt|Walddk2: That would be 3 IMPs to Zimmermann|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is a more genuine candidate for a pass out|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are they going to listen now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|lestergold: west will open nv|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nunes can open 2@H 10-13 5+ cards in their methods|pg||
nt|lestergold: he likes his spades and his shape|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ah, 2@H would also show an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So he needs a singleton or void|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: fantoni goes to pie|pg||
nt|cicus: interestingly, S missed that also|pg||
nt|henryb:  this was less certain than playing a club|pg||
nt|brolucius: I must look at that one again afterwards. I was not really concentrating and it seems that I may have missed one of the best plays of the match (by West). |pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: And Delfour takes the leadership|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: to what??  lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT by West is a little better than 4@S, but not so easy to get there when South opens 4@D :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: North will be worried.|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@dX is better than 4@s|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: EW might have won the board now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We shall see|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@S is a transfer to clubs. South has two possible rebids: 2NT and 3@C, but there is a difference of opinion as to which should show the better club fit. Some play one way, some ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: the other.|pg||
nt|drorp:  assuming south could bid 2NT to show good fit, N should pass now|pg||
nt|drorp:  but the vul is tempting|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: But West's double is surely for take-out. No way East can pass it with those spades.|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: not so sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: Nubes unlike closed room doesnt wait for auction to fizzle out|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Enterprising lead|pg||
nt|drorp:  yes very nice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would you have found that, David?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Generous adjective.|pg||
nt|drorp:  won't work in this case though :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  I have to go. May see you later|pg||
nt|brolucius: I would not have found it, now or in the future.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Henry|pg||
nt|brolucius: You think he is hoping to feign a singleton?|pg||
nt|brolucius: An awful 3NT by any standards, so N/S have done well here.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Fantoni will bid but will let him play there?|pg||
nt|drorp:  this will make, so Laffineur are about to regain the lead|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|chmitty: if Fantoni is let to play in 3@c he has a lot of reasons to make 9 triks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: That's also my guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think very good chance that he will get the clubs right|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: west is odds on to have short club|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brolucius: Declarer says: 'I was not born yesterday, my friend!'|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|chmitty: East final pass probably denies 4 cards in @d ... so fantoni already knows 4@s + 5@d by West|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s7|pg||
nt|chmitty: and he can test the @h|pg||

nt|djneill: semifiinals, sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: :)|pg||
nt|djneill: welcome all, if you don't know, North-South are one of the top 3 pairs in the world, if you ask anyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: the two semi finals are : zimmerman - delfour and Laffineur- Chemla|pg||
nt|djneill: ok great thanks laure|pg||
nt|djneill: Zimmerman will be appearing in the NEC cup in a few weeks, with fantoni-nunes and balicki-zmudzinski on board|pg||
nt|djneill: so this is just a warm-up|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|drorp:  trying to make 4, but west will be able to give a spade over-ruff after he wins @CA|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: Declarer could not afford top rise with the @CA anyway. He would probably have too many losers then.|pg||
nt|drorp:  The lead has a lot of reason, he wants to develop club tricks, so if partner has J or A it doesn't matter + it gives the chance to mislead declearer, and there is not much to lose, only tempo|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer can count to 10|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: 4252 not possible as that would give East 44 in the majors, and he would have responded 1@H|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|chmitty: he has to take the direct finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: if now he plays three rounds of hearts he will have count|pg||
nt|lestergold: has risks of course|pg||
nt|chmitty: that would be one off Roland|pg||
nt|chmitty: final uppercut|pg||
nt|chmitty: he has to mahe his decision after @h ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes doesnt work of course|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|brolucius: I think it was a dangerous lead, because the trumps were breaking badly. A club trick might be the setting trick from his point of view.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|chmitty: I believe he is going to play K@h @h to the ace, then @c10 ... and think|pg||

nt|vugraphzxr: for some informations : http://www.ffbridge.asso.fr/actualites/actualites.php?do=detail&id=383|pg||
nt|drorp:  and we finish with a routine 4@S, shouldn't be hard bidding although east at 3rd seat will bid a certain amount of hearts|pg||
nt|brolucius: If East opens 2@H, South is perhaps a bit good for 3@S. No maybe that is OK.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxr: Is not finish on the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|an|!h/!s in the weak head|nt|drorp:  S needs to find a bid now, i'm not sure he will|pg||
nt|brolucius: A good fit in clubs for N/S, May be difficult to bid game on their values, as the other table found.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: and no lunch break ... we don't have bridge players but gladiators !!!!|pg||
nt|cicus: 1NT nv cannot hurt much|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many thanks to Laure for a perfect display of VG-operating. We all appreciate it! Many thanks.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks too to Dror, my fellow commentator. It was an enjoyable session.|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: and e/w were always likely to gain in this auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: /hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|djneill: East bids 1@s over North's 1@h, which must not promise 5+@s, maybe X then would just show "something" but no other convenient bid|pg||
nt|chmitty: can he make 9 tricks ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: as they make 2 or 3 in the master suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he makes this, we have a tie|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: 9 he can't ... he has to make 8 to tie the match|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We don't know how many extra boards they will be playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: thank you every body i hope you will be here in few minutes for the last 16 boards|pg||
mb|4S|nt|brolucius: If the reach 4@H, they will have done very well.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has started with a double. That's a bit surprising. He surely wants to play in spades. Well, how many spades now? |pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: but now it's not easy to find a raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and we don't know if we have a file or not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not optimistic I must confess|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxr: And the last board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pass is extremely timid|pg||
nt|drorp:  wow, pass? why did you bid 1NT then?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|drorp:  the 3@C bid made him stronger|pg||
nt|brolucius: Over here, 2NT is used as a Lebensohl negative response and 3@C would promise about 8 points upwards, after which 3@S would be forcing.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|djneill: South's 3@d was just noise saying "I wasn't completely broke but I'm not maximum"|pg||
nt|brolucius: South barely had a 1NT response. When partner could not cue-bid or jump, he decided there would be no game there. Very reasonable.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|drorp:  yep same here|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|djneill: North was suprisingly restrained, at imps - but 6 losers - if South could cover 3 South would have accepted game|pg||
nt|djneill: if E-W don't attack @s they will not get any... going away on the @d's|pg||
nt|djneill: East's club lead should indicate length (maybe lowest from odd number) so Weset might find the switch|pg||
nt|djneill: West knows any @d honors are working for North|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: i remind you 3 segments of 16 boards for the semi final|pg||
nt|djneill: West can hope to get 1@c, 1@h, but at most 1 @d, needs to set it so needs to switch now|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|brolucius: He thinks his minor-suit cards are worth nothing.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|djneill: yes thanks Laure, this is a bad score, but just the first of three segments|pg||
nt|drorp:  i have to go, catch ya later all!|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told: in France, everybody plays inverted responses (2NT = positive). Ah, thanks for the info. So, 3@C was a negative showing clubs.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: just for remind you 3 segments of 16 boards for this final|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: the last segment is in few minutes stay online :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: It fits in with what I said earlier about how annoying it is that people play conventions differently.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|drorp:  well, they really aren't :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are you serious when you're saying that South should not raise to 3@H, David?|pg||

nt|vugraphzxr: bye bye|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sK|pg||
nt|brolucius: There are about 6 different versions of Lebensohl, even if 2NT is the negative. You have to explain sequences where the responder bids again (with a cue-bid, or 3NT).|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: i don't know what happen on the last board in the OR|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chmitty: he will have to play @d C from his hand at some time|pg||

pc|sT|pc|h5|nt|brolucius: Well, I would, but I can see why he didn't. They are both very good bidders.|pg||
nt|fokal: on the lead As of @h and @h, this line of play wouldn't work|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|fokal: declarer gets uppercutted|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: on the last board in the other 4@s= |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|djneill: West still has a shot, if he can ruff the 3rd @d if East switches to @s in time, but North is playing well here - East is marked for @cK and now @dK, so likely West has @hQ|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
