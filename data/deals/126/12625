nt|kaapo2:  Welcome back! Hi Markku P, Kalle and Juho|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And good morning to Markku M MÃ¤kelÃ¤|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|k ylinen: hi|pg||
nt|mmmakela: NS play modified Blue Club w 4c majs and canapes|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Rodal and all welcome|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  NS play Blue Club|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: not splinter|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1-suiter|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: suction|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i believe|pg||
nt|mmmakela: after 64 boards lots of imps have been scored|pg||
nt|runnerup: lucky slam to start|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: hi everyone, wlc|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: Hi all:) Nice to be here|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Easy play here - all suitys behave|pg||
nt|hedyg: check for 4 @ss|pg||
nt|wiki: 5 @S optimum as EW can make 5 1C or @D|pg||
nt|wiki: @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: hand when you know pd has @s:s but u wanna play in @h :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: now we see -now we didnt -i think south must transfer to clubs|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 clubs now?|pg||
nt|runnerup: ew makes 2 clubs ns 2 diamonds |pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzcz: 2 aces and the correct singelton, so missed a slam on this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  Holding a 4-card major, North usually would open with the major|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. But 3@H at least is on|pg||
nt|k ylinen: N passed with 11 hcp and balanced as system requires so|pg||
nt|runnerup: now sure|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Team SaTu was up by 50 IMPs after yesterday - but the lead was cut down to 17 IMPs during the first 8 board segment today|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i thought E would have bid 2@s|pg||
nt|mmmakela: N took a risk, S might not have dias suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i suppose S may correct to 2N since N showed max|pg||
nt|runnerup: six any from west is ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 6@d about finding @dQ (or 6@s by W)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: why didn't E bid 3 dias?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  That's why South gets to bypass her 4-card @H suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  For what reason 1 @D from North - and not 1 C???|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c-3@H-3NT= not intterested in @Hs looking for @ss|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Hello|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Kaapo|pg||
nt|k ylinen: tough bidding|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Still 24 boards to play|pg||
nt|mmmakela: normally N has 5 dias for this bid|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kaapo2:  Good evening Raija :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last time it went 1@S  4@H  declarer was in a 0-0 fit. Sadly, it wasn't on vugraph|pg||
nt|wiki: bur probably 3 pass here|pg||
nt|miniemin: East-West "Ranna Ruutu"  system from Estonia|pg||
nt|rnmalik: small @D and after @SA @D return some guessing by the declarer|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: because with 4 4 they open 1@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is systemic|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I see - but why?|pg||
nt|wiki: but - sorry about my fingers :(|pg||
nt|wiki: hello again and welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: you could bid 4@c asking pd to trf to his suit, then pass the 4@h response|pg||
nt|mmmakela: didn't know promised max|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rodal f: Test the @C for the hook and 3-3. If not 3-3 u need to hit the @D, but here the @C works|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi Mikko!|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|hedyg: because when the bidding goes 1@d-1@s-X he can bid 2@c without 4@hs and no @s stopper|pg||
nt|doctorone: Frankly, I would just have bid 3N as S. See where we are now. But as it is our day, we will survive in 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: but 3NT shows 4@ss to me|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I do hope, that the survival will be in 4 NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would bid 3@s without them and 3NT with them|pg||
nt|doctorone: I meant over 2NT, bidding 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: why give up on finding a 4 4 @s fit?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  This is a sequence it's good to have an agreement on so that you don't get to play in a 1-0 fit|pg||
nt|runnerup: changes for +1|pg||
pc|sK|nt|peachy: this should make max 7 tricks if lucky|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Ah, Roland has 0-0|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi specs and vug operator:)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|runnerup: yes south had dimonds but very weak opening otherwise-perhaps lucky + score anyhow|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  But hard to find the killing @d-lead against 4 NT...|pg||
nt|hedyg: pd will NEVER bid over 3NT ....:(|pg||
nt|miniemin: Hi Markku|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hawe45:  Good by to a plus-score|pg||
nt|doctorone: I don't want to open a debate... I know how many positions about this issue exist, but I don't like bidding 2N with 4@s... So my problem is solved. I know, they are drawbacks of ...|pg||
nt|doctorone: course|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In fact, 4 @H can NEVER mak - if not South plays @H to the 10, he is short of entries|pg||
nt|peachy: prob six|pg||
nt|oliverc: .|pg||
nt|wiki: both pairs playing  strong club|pg||
pc|s5|nt|oliverc: Well that sequence owed more to Culbertson than anything CC Wei might have|pg||
nt|oliverc: come up with :)|pg||
nt|wiki: now 420|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now 9 is good|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|doctorone: good lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: coded 9s?|pg||
nt|doctorone: seems so, or just a falsecard, in front of N's opening?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbx: stephan thinks|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: only with @s lead this is 9 tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rodal f: Re hi:)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|oliverc: but who are we to argue with success?|pg||
nt|muppe: +1 now it seems. Defence would have done its best with trump lead or switch at trick 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Kursat Ozsahin|pg||
nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Tha was killing (the) defence|pg||
nt|runnerup: with 9 diamonds 6 can be found if east supports i think|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kaapo2:  I think EW play strong club with 5-card majors and 14-16 1NT|pg||
