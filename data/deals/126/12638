nt|Walddk2: Special welcome to Bobby Wolff. This is his first appearance as an online commentator|pg||
nt|joest: and hopefully not the last|pg||
mb|1S|nt|joest: hi Bobby|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|kit: hi Bobby|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: north-south might get too high here if south finds a raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|kit: This looks like it should be a normal club part-score, but many pairs play artificial methods here|pg||
nt|dburn: too high? they might even make 5@c on this lie of cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|dburn: and they might do better still if South is allowed to double this for penalty, but...|pg||
nt|joest: would you have raised to 3@c kit?|pg||
nt|kit: 11 tricks look hard to come by|pg||
nt|joest: not sure what north should do over 2@h.  Modern scientists might play double as t/o with extras|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: they do, but East would probably have led a diamond - easier then|pg||
nt|kit: no, I totally agree with the pass (unless my methods allow a non-invitational 3@C call)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The 5th club is enough for a raise in my opinion|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Provided that 2@C shows clubs, and it appears so|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|joest: they might easily get to 3NT after that which, to be fair, is not the world's worst contract|pg||
nt|dburn: could be - do we know if NS play a strong club system?|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h5|nt|joest: they are in 5@c in the other room so we will have a swing right out of the gate|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|c7|pg||
nt|kit: The danger with raising on the Sout hand is that you might make the same sort of raise on a flatter 11-count|pg||
nt|joest: right.  If you play "BART" or some system which pinpoints a 'weaker' raise, you might be able to get by|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I predict 11 tricks will be made in clubs as long as N takes the ace of clubs and stops|pg||
nt|joest: well we'll see if they 'stop' in the other room :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|kit: E-W have various possible games here -- 3NT, 4@H, or 5@C|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|dburn: not so easy to discover that they have a spade guard for 3NT, though|pg||
mb|2S|nt|joest: 5@c seems the most likely game to reach|pg||
nt|kit: Difficult to put together that they have a combined spade stopper, so I'm guessing they will land in 5@C|pg||
nt|joest: now what should east rebid to show some values?|pg||
nt|joest: this is another weak spot in standard methods|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if East just bids 3@c here, not altogether clear for West to go on at all|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|kit: East will probably bid 3@C -- now if West persists with 3@S, they may get to the better 3NT contract|pg||
nt|joest: in some partnerships I play that 'step one' here is a bust and any other call shows something|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|Walddk2: 5@C went 2 down on board 1 in the other room. Declarer did not follow Bobby's line|pg||
nt|joest: east certainly has a 5@c call now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec_bul.html   list of teams |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: 5@C should be easy to make in a number of ways, but may have to be a bit careful|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: yes the 4-1 break slows things down a bit|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dburn: well, 4@c will make - East more than a little cautious|pg||
nt|kit: I don't like that pass at all.  In face, in my partnerships a non-competitive 4 of a minor call is forcing.  Stopping at 4 of a minor in a constructive auction is losing bridge.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|joest: so you would play this call as forcing Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: 100% forcing, yes|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|joest: I play it if my partner has shown something.  So if I open 1D and it goes 1S, then 3D rebid, now 4D is forcing|pg||
nt|kit: I don't agree with the 4@C call as it flies past 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: yes 3@s seems better|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s6|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|kit: West didn't have to show the club support.  It had already been implied by the 2@S call.  If West didn't have 3-card club support, something other than 2@S would have been bid.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: Now Zia would say you could open south's hand 2@h then bid clubs later|pg||
nt|kit: Yes.  The takeout doubler doubled again, and their partner passed.  Principle is that what was a takeout double doesn't suddenly turn into a penalty double.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|kit: You could, but you might have to do it at the 5-level.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|joest: that's what makes bridge fun :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: South may have to guess again now, if East bids 4@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|joest: yes the wasted Q of hearts + facing a passed hand argues against 2@h|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3S|nt|joest: West has obviously seen East bid before! :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|kit: Note how much room the South auction gave the opponents to explore, and it may help them in the play also.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: 2@s is one of the biggest underbids I"ve seen in a while|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it might induce North to double|pg||
nt|joest: indeed it might|pg||
nt|joest: after ace of diamond and a diamond ruff can they make it?|pg||
nt|kit: I think so|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|longhorns:  Yes|pg||
nt|dburn: sure they can|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: clubs go on diamonds, then crossruff -- seems straightforward unless I miscounted.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dburn: wrong heart - the king would have been more awkward|pg||

nt|longhorns:  OK, thaniks|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kit: Normal 1NT response it looks like -- will South then risk a 2@S overcall?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|dburn: maybe not - if 2@s would make (and partner would pass it) then 1NT might go down on a spade lead|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: A deal you should get once in a 14-board match, on average. High card points divided 20-20. There is a (roughly) 7% chance that both sides have 20 hcp|pg||
nt|kit: Well, this makes the overcall easier.  I truly don't understand why 1@D instead of 1NT|pg||
nt|longhorns:  South needs to gut it up and bid 2 spades if North passes and East responds 1NT.  NS can make 3 spades|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|joest: neither do I kit|pg||
nt|longhorns:  East needs to learn that it is more dangerous to only respond 1 diamond than to respond the preemptive 1NT which could keep a conservative soul out of the bidding|pg||
nt|kit: Note that at other table East did bid 1NT, South overcalled, and North had to make a game try -- down 1.|pg||
nt|joest: not a Texan mind you|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|kit: So once again, making life easy for the opponents has its usual effect -- they get to the right contract.|pg||
nt|longhorns:  EW would in fact have gone down 1 in 1NT, but it is a bidder|pg||
nt|joest: all a testament to the power of 1NT|pg||
nt|joest: they probably have a + coming but if you 'gut it up' and bid 2@s you catch a raise from partner|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|d8|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if West had some balanced 18-count with @sAQ, one could imagine 1@d working rather better, but still...|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|longhorns:  Best defense is to lead or switch to trumps but trying to defeat 2 spades will not be possible|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|kit: Good trump shift -- declarer isn't home yet|pg||
nt|kit: several ways to make -- one is to just play diamond to jack, getting a second diamond trick|pg||
pc|d6|nt|joest: seems the easiest way|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: Another is diamond to ace, club to jack, as West doesn't have another spade|pg||
nt|longhorns:  Declarer needs to lead a diamond to the nine now in order to create the eighth trick|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer now deciding which line to play for|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: Lucky that West had to win that club|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|nt|kit: Very bad line of play -- declarer got lucky in the club spots|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|longhorns:  Yes, very lucky!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|joest: declarer was going to luck out by ruffing out the diamond with some major suit reentry|pg||
