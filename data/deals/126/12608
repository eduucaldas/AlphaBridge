nt|athene: 4@S wouldn't have been fun for NS - west was just waiting to get his hands on that one|pg||
nt|ciaran: Hi all|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Ciaran|pg||
nt|petergill: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: welcome to all|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: this is the 3 segment of the 3 round quarter finals|pg||
nt|petergill: This is the last 12 boards of a 36 board quarter-final in New Delhi, India|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Ruzbeh|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: hi|pg||
nt|petergill: A quiet heart partscore to start, perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: Lets see if NS help/push EW to slam?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|james_h: Tom Hanlon takes matters into his own hands|pg||
nt|james_h: Given this start,I think south will definately sac in 6@s ... lets see|pg||
nt|mcarroll: How many @S from Hugh? 4 I guess|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and now we will compare the scores|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: that last board may well produce a swing - as even 3@s on spot on defenc cant make|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Hamman in his book castigated the jack-denies lead method. |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..and hi William|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mcarroll: 3@D = transfer|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: Hi Martin|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: Reckoned it gave declarer more help than it was worth |pg||
nt|chick: how high will NS go in @Ds?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: As ever with these thngs, the truth is somewhere near the middle|pg||
nt|chick: looks like 4 is the limit|pg||
nt|frankaus: this action quite a contrast to th OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: PC technical problem with the CR NIBU NI match|pg||
nt|mdgraham: an enterprising 1@S overcall |pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: And James is right if EW bid 6 they will find the save|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one will take some work|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi David|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: normal enough to reach 4major when you have a 5-4 fit and some shape|pg||
nt|andyv:  and some help which the @c lead does provide|pg||
nt|athene: but south's values aren't exactly where north wants them|pg||
nt|petergill: Welcome to my co-commentator Frank Budai|pg||
pc|h2|nt|frankaus: 3NT here would be my choice aswell|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|petergill: South would balance with a Dbl if he was in the pass-out (last to speak, or balancing) position. |pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: duck a diamond|pg||
nt|james_h: whos buying?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  defence can well start with taking first 5 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't believe that this is the auction|pg||
nt|cuttysark: good afternoon|pg||
nt|ady: hi     late start|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ciaran: Looks like an easy 4S or a thin 6S here which will fail due to both trump honours being offside|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|frankaus: 10 quickly|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mcarroll: OK - me|pg||
nt|james_h: Martin is a great team player|pg||
nt|athene: east had better jump in with the @DA and switch to a spad|pg||
nt|athene: spade|pg||
nt|andyv:  difficult hand to declare... when N goes after @ds, the @s switch will be obvious|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: good double - wrong ace for a maximum penalty godd still going down|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not yet though|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  been pushed too high    cant make 4 if diamonds attacjed early|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  but E seems to be unaware of the danger to the hand|pg||
nt|athene: well it's very hard for east - he doesn't know anything about declarer's hand|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: needed to win diamond ace first time really..|pg||
nt|andyv:  but he does know he has no tricks in @ds and @cs... @s suit is only hope|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think winning A of @d was all that difficult|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone and welcome to New Delhi|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry for the 1 hour delay|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: miskeyed.....will catch up at claiming|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Sunit|pg||
nt|sunit: hi all|pg||
nt|petergill: Trump lead gives declarer some work to do|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ady: attacked|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|c8|pc|hT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi James, Martin and specs I'm Frank from hot Norway. Just -23C now:)|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks to be -1 from here|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, the trump leads are very good defence. |pg||
pc|c2|nt|cuttysark: 5@C wasn't making either, but it is normal to take out insurance on hands like these|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: with the added advantage that the defence may not take the queen|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Frank|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Sinil     Liz|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ciaran: when the wind is in your sails, these contracts make - a little unlucky for Hamilton and Ferguson|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mcarroll: A bit unfortunate - the bidding looks reasonable, unlucky to find the trumps stacked. So first imps to CBAIlookk|pg||
pc|h4|nt|frankaus: 11 now & may take @H fin for 12|pg||
nt|chick: wish I knew what 3@H meant .. might be a clue to whether to finesse @Hs or not|pg||
nt|mdgraham: high card raise to 3@S, I suspect|pg||
pc|s5|nt|james_h: North needs to establish @d because he cant draw t and ruff, 3@c and 1@h|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|wilkinsona: best of fortune re exams..|pg||
nt|athene: even if you know that declarer has a singleton diamond, it might sometimes be right to duck - give declarer @SAxx for instance|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
nt|athene: now rising the ace gives him pitches for both spades but if you duck he loses no diamond but two spades|pg||
nt|athene: but i agree it might have ben findable if east remembers his side needs FOUR tricks to beat this|pg||
nt|andyv:  as long as this isn't match points, rising with A of @d and switching to K of @s was called for. |pg||
nt|petergill: If the defence never touched trumps, declarer could probably hold his losses to only his five top losers|pg||
pc|d7|nt|frankaus: Value raise of @S would be my guess|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|nt|chick: could it show something in hearts besides?|pg||
nt|frankaus: even 13 now on @H finn|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H a make n/s   but would not be allowed to play there|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  N guessed right... he could have saved himself a headache by not cashing the Ace of @cs first|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h9|pc|c9|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|frankaus: @C ruff is always likely tho|pg||

nt|mcarroll: After 3 frantic boards - a little placidity?|pg||
nt|andyv:  in the open room, N made 5@h|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: NS rather got away with that I'm afraid..|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for standings, convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|mcarroll: well played to flatten the board|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: director has been called for settling a dispute|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: dispute resolved - scores remain the same|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   can make 4@H    may have difficulty getting there|pg||
nt|petergill: The defence at the other table correclty led trumps, but they switched away from trumps too early. |pg||
mb|1D|nt|petergill: allowing declarer to ruff the club high |pg||
mb|d|nt|chick: this bid won't make N's day any happier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tell us about the players Sunit, please|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S husband and wife as far as I recall|pg||
mb|1S|nt|james_h: McGann dows not like passing |pg||
nt|sunit: sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I could be wrong |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hI liz|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Ok. I can leave so they come back:)|pg||
nt|sunit: rajeev and himani are a husband- wife pair from Mumbai|pg||
nt|ady: north take-out double has given them a chance|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Yes 4@H is a great contract|pg||
mb|1N|nt|frankaus: X or 1nt here  - 1NT 4 me|pg||
mb|d|nt|frankaus: S need to run |pg||
nt|andyv:  sometimes the obvious escapes us at the table|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like 2S is the last making contract|pg||
mb|2S|nt|james_h: but bidding 2@d here is a poor IMPS bid|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I might have made a horrible takeout double with the South hand because of the 4-4 majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: Hang on a min Rodal :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunit: I am not sure which Banerjee is this but must be from the railway team|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Too much, four obvious losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: we'll give you 2 more hands|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mcarroll: I am surprised that S in Open did not bid|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H by north conservative|pg||
nt|petergill: South is disciplined enough to stop bidding, despite 19 HCP|pg||
nt|petergill: downgrading KQ doubleton, Frank? |pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: east liked the hidden diamond fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  now this one really does require a lot of work|pg||
nt|ady: by South   sorry|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if vul they may hav pushed on to game|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems a little conservative to me|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|davidstern: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: yes this banerjee is from railways.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sunit: only way to beat this contract is after cashing both the clubs north has to play a heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, this may make now|pg||
nt|sunit: difficult though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Too late|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sfoxa:  in modern bidding, strong dbl on 1N is out of date |pg||
pc|cA|nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|athene: you can be a lot more aggressive with hands like east's if you know it's a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  3 chances to make... slim, fat and none|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he expected 2@H to guarantee a 4th trump|pg||
nt|frankaus: yes the whole hand needs to be downgraged imo|pg||
pc|c2|nt|davidstern: This will make if declarer is careful in the trump suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Needed a heart lead|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|nt|andyv:  some use 2N (this time it would be by E) to find out what quality of raise partner gave them... it would have helped this time|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes E has assumed 4 hearts, and I think at least 3 diamonds and added a bit more as well|pg||
nt|athene: north has quite a lot of defensive cards not to double this|pg||
nt|athene: but his partner is a passed hand and he doesn't have any distributional surprises|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, E was a bit optomistic....2@h was already too high|pg||
nt|athene: and no-one forced east to bid game!|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 8 tricks only and no real pressure on E/W - i cant see a 9th ?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ciaran: the defense can get a cross ruff going here for -3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes in first position, but a balancing dbl over 2@H is very much in vogue|pg||
nt|davidstern: Still may be OK if he runs a heart from dummy|pg||
nt|sunit: no can still beat|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|sunit: with a heart switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: well, whether South runs or not depends on your parameters for doubling 1NT   |pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South can be endplayed to lead away from @DK|pg||
nt|sunit: why?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Though I suppose if the heart finesse was wrong 4@H might not make|pg||
pc|c9|nt|wilkinsona: whereas west cards were in spades where he thought they werent|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mcarroll: Me neither|pg||
nt|sunit: no he can exit a trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what trump? I cash all my trumps but one|pg||
nt|sunit: no endplay here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What are you going to throw on the spades?|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|petergill: Good club lead - this looks like 200 to NS|pg||
pc|h8|nt|frankaus: with a flattish 1 count u know this is not a gr8 spot|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|mcarroll: Unless the defence slip|pg||
nt|davidstern: The defence have now put this at risk by forcing declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'll watch your discards and endplay you|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|james_h: 1imp pick up here|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: agreed, if you are certain partner cannot hold (for example) AKQJ sixth  plus an ace |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ciaran: Surprisingly, north didn't overcall at the other table|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andyv:  this auction needs to go back to the drawing board|pg||
pc|h3|nt|james_h: sry, 0 imps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Nerio Vakil|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wilkinsona: just as well Scotland defended well in CR...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: back to -2 now|pg||

nt|rodal f: Some fun again?|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3NT is possible here for N/S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I claim that only a heart lead beats it|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: slam time|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Certainly looks like it|pg||

nt|sunit: i agree, roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 6@S   excellent e/w     must avoid playing in 4-4 heart fit in the slam zone|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@D, 6NT and 6@S are all interesting possible contracts on this hand|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|james_h: 2@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  1N=12-14?|pg||
nt|ciaran: E/W need to be careful here again - W will be thinking slam now, but E has the wrong values for him|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rodal f: U have counted the months?:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Nice @S fit|pg||
nt|sunit: Delhi, The Crown plaza hotel is the venue|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: 1@C either 11-13 balanced or strong|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this is a good lead it seems|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  5 tricks in NT |pg||
nt|petergill: West passed his 12 count, donwngrading the singleton queen|pg||
nt|frankaus: KR values it at 17.25-  http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=kq+aq96+qj8+aj75|pg||
mb|2D|nt|james_h: 2@c shows strong,without fit (in std carrot)|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: west hand is a problem hand for the weak nters as you can (and they have) missed their spade fit.  With such decent @s's i'd have opened 1@s|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 7@S makes..|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: on repeated trump leads this can fail|pg||
nt|ady: playing 6@S  a decent score|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C inverted minor raise|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, not inverted minor, 1@C must be Strong Club|pg||
mb|2S|nt|james_h: I dont believe South has shown his clubs naturally, he may have implied them|pg||
nt|rodal f: Should be implied now so 4@C to come?|pg||
nt|james_h: the fact the 3h is not alerted makes me think its just natural|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: looks as if they might pefewr the 4-4 fit... unfortunately|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C would be 5+ clubs, 8+ points, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgh: Late alert of 3H|pg||
nt|ciaran: Well bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@H looks like an overbid |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D and 2@S natural|pg||
nt|petergill: EW in game-forcing auction |pg||
mb|2N|nt|james_h: ok, south must have shown clubs |pg||
nt|po-s: he has shown clubs when he doesn´t rebid NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: the 4@D cue does not improve the E hand so they quit in time|pg||
nt|davidstern: Combined 24 cound stopped well short |pg||
nt|sunit: can be beaten by 2 tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT Pass 3@D should excite East|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  W must be happy with this lead, not @d|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rodal f: Hei Peo|pg||
nt|james_h: I think McG will drive this bus home now in the snow|pg||
nt|vinbtech: and a 9 card minor fit to boot as well|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el is the tourney website|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|andyv:  lacking the spot cards, 4th best (or low for some) is the best lead with the W cards in @ds|pg||
nt|athene: will declarer try to steal a spade to make?|pg||
nt|vinbtech: though 3n is far from easy; a tempo behind imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: well at  least they will get a plus score     might even turn out to be a good score for e/w if in CR they get overboard in a heart slam|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D shows 4@S 3@D 5@C and thus only one @h opposite Axxx = perfect, so heading for 6@D or even (unlikely) 7@D |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Nice to see that Mike Lawrence has so many fans in India. They even named a club after him as you see on the scoreboard|pg||
mb|6D|nt|Walddk5: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D sets @D as trumps, 4@S cue bid of ace or king or both|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: true David|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sunit: now only 1 down|pg||
nt|xenya: i thought W would pass, then bid 2@S if needed|pg||
nt|petergill: Not looking for 7@D, as West is a passed hand, and "8 trumps" is not enough for 7@D to be a good % chance|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mcarroll: This bus has snow chains James?|pg||
nt|andyv:  is it stealing?|pg||
nt|athene: actually no need to steal, especially - opps don't have anything to cash|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sunsamvar: bingo David|pg||
nt|ady: down 1 in 6@H in CR|pg||
pc|d4|nt|frankaus: this will require some work - lets c if Namit brings it in|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: or not enough|pg||
nt|andyv:  just has to guess correctly|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep a guess...|pg||
nt|davidstern: Played by north would likely be no problem|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|chick: looks like it will make now|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|sunit: wow|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petergill: No heart cue bid, as West had already guaranteed singleton or void heart in the bidding|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d8|nt|ady: unlucky for e/w pair in CR|pg||

mb|p|nt|ciaran: Very favourable layout here for E/W - @SQJ doubleton, @DQ9 onside, @C 3-3, @HJ right|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not a classical weak 2, but I know a lot of players who would open 2@S|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  well played, yes.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well guessed|pg||
nt|petergill: NS could probably have made 1NT - it was a close decision - South's lack of spades being one factor against opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgh: When she saw dummy|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: spec says EW will get to slam here|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Low club lead against 3NT and you are bound to go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: Another hand where a spade slam may be investigated, but they need to stop at 4S|pg||
nt|frankaus: operator can we know the score from the previous rounds pls|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andyv:  seems like a reasonable slam... not sure why it would go down|pg||
nt|athene: how do you fail in 6@H?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: viewgraph probably represented the true state of affairs there...|pg||
nt|andyv:  trumps are 2-2 and only need to ruff 2@cs in dummy|pg||
nt|panja: 4@H should be cold..but on wrong @C guess 3N will be in jeopardy|pg||
nt|petergill: Playing a Strong Club system, opening on a good 10 or 11-15 is OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: what happened there?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Difficult decision for S now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No defence any more|pg||

pc|cA|nt|athene: yes declarer set off ruffing clubs but very carelessly ruffed a diamond with the @H2|pg||
nt|athene: there was a hand in a set earlier this morning where declarer had something like @S63 in dummy and ruffing with the @S6 stopped an overruff|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4 hearts was a sign off but west moves on..|pg||
nt|athene: west is always bidding slam with that hand after 1@H|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: @S suit not getting mentioned here so far|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Any single-suiter?|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: single suitor i think.. woolsey|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: ahhh|pg||
nt|ady: yes  I think so|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@H needs @D 3-3 and @SA onside, so 4@H is where you want to be|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: just a question of six or seven|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|panja: 100% in Match points|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|athene: perhaps there was a misunderstanding about the nature of 6@H here|pg||
nt|athene: east thought 5NT was asking for specific kings so 6@H denied one|pg||
nt|athene: and west thought 6@H showed two side kings|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting push board|pg||
nt|athene: if that isn't the case, west was just illogical - why not bid 7@H over 5?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: thats quite a raise by east on a 5 count but the clues are there - pd at least 6/4 opps bidding @D pd short .. good bid|pg||

mb|2S|nt|mcarroll: The Open Room must have crashed, so we are not getting comparisons, but they bid and made 4@S on this board|pg||
nt|ciaran: 2H is a good result for N/S since it looks like E/W will make 2S, though it might be hard to get into the auction|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3@S asking for a @S stop|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  who will play this board will be disappointed heavily - all possible honours are off side|pg||

nt|frankaus: NS lead by 20 imps before this set|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: running to 2@H like this sounds like 5 hearts|pg||

nt|petergill: As South denied 4 spades (else South would rebid 1@S), 2@S is a safe rebid, cannot be raised to 4@S|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: thanks operator|pg||
nt|ciaran: May not have been E thinking - they are playing with screens|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  the Italian teams of the 60s made a fortune by not opening 1N with 4-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|athene: alternatively east could redouble|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he wanted to declare himself - didn't want the lead coming through all his tenaces|pg||

pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: What about conceding two diamonds and claim?|pg||

nt|vinbtech: y thats right|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: cant really see how to make  going up with A@C  does not solve anything either|pg||

pc|s5|nt|andyv:  I don't know if EW have that sophisticated of a partnership|pg||

nt|eamongall: looks like I missed some imps ..boards 1 3 4 ... but its ok ..there is still 25 boards in this match so maybe another 100 imps to be shared |pg||
nt|andyv:  or MSS and S's 6@c was p/c|pg||
nt|andyv:  either way, good contract|pg||
nt|ciaran: I'm giving up on predictions :)|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: unfortunate - by north unlikely E would find a @h lead ... may well lead to a swing if open room N playing str NT  1NT - 3NT|pg||
nt|panja: a result based on personalities rather than methods|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easy 140 but 2 IMPs to MLC|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: 6 clubs a good bid, whatever I think|pg||
nt|athene: and the count wasn't rectified for a spade-diamond squeeze on east|pg||
nt|ciaran: Certainly, but any minor honour would be far more valueable - @D K instead of @S K and slam is good|pg||
nt|davidstern: Blackwood and three key cards would work a treat|pg||

nt|petergill: East was hoping to cash a 2nd @D after @CA, but @CA was not a necesary play on any layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: Whats this Twitter thing ...says I can get tweets from the Camrose2010 ...or something |pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: interesting collection poll 4 contract ? 5@C 4 me|pg||

nt|chick: first NS have to get in the action|pg||

nt|vinbtech: 3D= 4144 8+; more likely 11+|pg||

nt|eamongall: Blue Club stuff for Murchan Burns ..well it used to be when they played a few years ago |pg||

nt|petergill: At the other table on Bd 33, West bid 2NT over 2@C, 3@S from East, 3NT by West = final contract |pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: 3NT is unbelievably lucky. You need spades to be 6-3|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Yes, not a swing hand|pg||

mb|2H|nt|chick: not me, cansino points or no, N has nothing to justify an opening in my book|pg||

mb|p|nt|eamongall: Murchan is lucky he is not in a slam ....opening with that kind of "put in your own word" |pg||
nt|andyv:  this may not make|pg||
nt|athene: when south rose the @CA that was a suggestion he held the @CQ too|pg||
nt|eamongall: ok back to the other room ...my vote is down 1 by Padraig O Brien |pg||
nt|ciaran: Much more interesting on a @D lead!|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: Bidding as correcter|pg||
nt|ciaran: My predictions have been wrong so far, but I back Padraig to make this.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, a spade lead gets @CK into play|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 33 is a good example that bridge is a bidder's game. Even if 3NT failed at the other table, their team still gains 2 imps|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: well, this may sneak hime. East has two awkward discards if the diaomds are cashed|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Played from W in open and @C lead away from the K made the opportunity for 12 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c should ask for @h back|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Claim soon|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|kdr_fm: Dedication Peter - pay to go away to commentate ... Roland just needs another 30 or so of you !!|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|andyv:  now @s back and E will have to guess which suit to cash|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but spade needed now..|pg||

pc|s9|nt|petepunt: looks like match has swung on 1 lead so far ?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|ciaran: the problem is E's @S9 - may need a deep finesse to make|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yep|pg||

nt|andyv:  well, that was one break:)|pg||
nt|athene: there were a lot of indications available to north there|pg||
nt|athene: his partner ruffed with the @DQ so probably hasn't got another trump|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Well done - and your predictions are back on track Ciaran|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: if he found lead from AJx i'd be stunned|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 34: 11 easy tricks in 3NT, the play at the end might not have been exactly as recorded|pg||
mb|1H|nt|chick: well he did get his clubs, right after the opps got 6 tricks :)|pg||
nt|athene: also pass then 2@H suggests 4-6 in the majors|pg||
nt|petepunt: orob weak nt from dafjones|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: another Maltish hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: how will East go about this one?|pg||
nt|athene: also the @H10 is suit-preference for spades|pg||
nt|vicky888: unlucky EWs at other table|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  I agree Bill... I don't think @s return was that hard to find but N didn't want to lead away from K@s|pg||
mb|d|nt|eamongall: BBO players teabag1 and The Bishop ... make up the team (Mike Coffey and John Lavery ) |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Rather strange that West did not lead @CK in the other rom...|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: club lead stand out from both sides|pg||
mb|2H|nt|frankaus: 4@S immediatly would be my choice|pg||
nt|chick: bid both of his suits|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone like N's dbl?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   have to p lay 4@H   on 4-3 fit  to make game    assuming a club lead in no-trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: I knew Padraig would not let me down!|pg||
nt|ady: or cam make 5@D|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so DSM LOOK AS IF THEY ARE RUNNING AWAY WITH THIS q/f|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl is dangerous at this vulnerability|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: that looks suspiciously forcing |pg||
nt|mdgraham: but is 5@D natural now, or simply a cue bid?|pg||
nt|chick: don't know, but either will do|pg||
nt|chick: I'll bet he passes though|pg||
nt|frankaus: we have a 9 card M fit wit game values|pg||
nt|chick: bad suits, doesn't know if pard has the honors in the right places|pg||
nt|chick: (which he doesn't)|pg||
nt|frankaus: opp a weak NT  slam is a minor miracle |pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: She!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@S asks for Majors and strength|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW took 8 tricks in OR. what about doing the same in defence?|pg||
nt|petepunt: both @d wrong prob 2 off|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgh: Michelle Brunner|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Sry for caps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: South seems to be getting the diamonds into the game, but it is alwyas hard to diagnose opposing doubletons|pg||
nt|petergill: Had South pased the Double, EW would have been in serious trouble|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mcarroll: 3@C has to be max without a Major|pg||
nt|ciaran: the bad diamond break dooms 3N here|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 5 tricks will be good going.  May try @sA and @d finesse playing W for @dHx or HHx|pg||
nt|petergill: East has only 3 tricks and no more, so the vulnerable Double without any suit texture is very risky|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vicky888: flat board it seems|pg||
nt|nerio24: should be -1|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what is the best way to play the @H suit ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Low towards the jack|pg||
nt|vicky888: play a low heart to jack, |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: west will be happy with this lead|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|eamongall: I am informed I am wrong |pg||
nt|eamongall: about the team|pg||
nt|james_h: Hanlon was taking insurance with 4@s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: First imps to NI|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: over the last few hands NS have played very well it seems...|pg||
nt|andyv:  they certainly have made good decisions|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..and have bid this well|pg||
nt|andyv:  Board 10 not returning a @s is about the only play that I can be critical on|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H was quite pushy|pg||
nt|andyv:  it is but it works... hard to argue with success... I do it all the time and haven't found anyone to listen:)|pg||
nt|athene: well, it works if he makes this :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  is there that much to the play?|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see any way it can't make|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west coming to the same conclusion I think...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only one loser if East has Honour10|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sunsamvar: and in the 2nd round|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I would have thuoght club was even more obvious in the other room where West had bid spades and not been supported|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: can play east for Q10 or K10 dblton   or either hand for KQ doubleton|pg||
nt|ady: same contract  aalso by North make in CR|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|james_h: How date he lost us IMPs|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
nt|james_h: Tom used to be better at insurance|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: 3@H is quite a good bid, as it acts as a system-tester. Do EW have the capability to stop in 3@S if that is the limit of the hand, or do they have to bid to 4@S and go off  |pg||
nt|james_h: (his former career)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes my question is in the second round do you play for !KQ or H10 ?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mcarroll: But then he got a better offer!|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|ciaran: can test diamonds, then play on H and end up taking a S finesse for a 9th trick, but you're then 2 off|pg||
pc|c6|nt|eamongall: I am wrong ... I just thought as no sign of Greenwood Anderson on this team ..it had to be the 2nd team |pg||

nt|kdr_fm: how ?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Sry for caps|pg||
nt|ady: I think KQ doubleton either hand better   though low towards jack can gain if east has stiff 10 and you guess well|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: and to the organisers and to Roland and BBO for bringing us this broadcast|pg||

mb|1D|nt|wilkinsona: thanks, Christine|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Thank you Sunil, and our excellent operator who has done a great job|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: seems 4@H   should make with both black kings well placed  even with bad heart split|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: interesting auction in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is, east thought that 2@D was majors|pg||
nt|petepunt: 1@C 16+ or bal 11-15|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2 @s + 2 @d + 1 @h + 1 @c - where is the 7th? |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@H is a decent contract here but killed with the 5-0 break|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to our good operator Ruzbeh, to Frank Budai for comments, and to the Indian bridge organisers in New Delhi for making this broadcast possible|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sunsamvar: dbl|pg||
nt|vicky888: has to be|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: some pairs play 1minor (1nt) 2minor = both majors|pg||
nt|ciaran: Could be more IMPS for NIBU here - E's 10 count was worth a game bid opposite a 14-16 NT, but they may stay lower here due to playing a different range|pg||
nt|petepunt: looks good for 20-22|pg||
nt|nerio24: wow|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Yes Raja had been royally good :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Some players would respond 4@D with the East hand - 5-5Majors, no slam interest|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: SF at 9:30 am IST|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision-style|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mcarroll: There was none - but it is scored as making|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Nice gadget|pg||
mb|5D|nt|kdr_fm: schance here 6@c is on|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: It did make defensive error|pg||
nt|frankaus: TU Peter fine operating Ruzbeh|pg||
mb|5S|nt|eamongall: I must say ...the camrose2010 website even tells you where to buy fish and chips ...as well as all the useful bridge information |pg||
nt|eamongall: Designed by Mr Officer ..hurray for him |pg||
nt|mcarroll: In Open E backed in with 3@C after much the same auction and plays there|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: got away|pg||
nt|vicky888: tripathi lost the opportunity to gain 9 IMPs and settled for 3 here|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: thanks all....esp. the commentators and BBO team|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: ignore my last comment --it's the other way round|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Means doing without Texas transfers, but here it gets the lead to the right hand|pg||
nt|petergill: North might raise this to 6@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: wow, that's an unusual lead choice|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yep|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This auction will inevitably make the weaker hand declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Undo please|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: sorry QF 3/3 tom. 9:30 IST not SF|pg||
nt|Walddk4: East bid 4@D|pg||
nt|frankaus: 6@S looks to make 6@S 5@C +@H|pg||
pc|dA|nt|petepunt: 6@C tough to bid|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: returned a heart didnt cash @CJ ?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: K10xx rather than KQxx|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk4: Maybe not|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It makes little sense to me to enter the auction at the 4-level|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Acceptable with a different type of suit, but A109xxx is rather asking for trouble|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: North is probably trying to salvage something from a bad session|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Better at favourable vulnerability|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but he knows the majors are breaking badly... so why i wonder|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think East will bid 4@H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i would|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: E in think mode|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It will cost a million and a half on the mandatory trump lead|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|petergill: Results at http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ciaran: should make 9 tricke for 5 IMPs to NIBU|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Wrong again :)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d2|nt|Walddk4: Not sure where East got a slam invite from|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the 4@D bid tells East that bad breaks are posssible and his ptrs @D points are probably wasted|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But I think he will escape the double and so not lose much|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so the salvage operation worked like a dream|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He is about @SK short of an slam invite imo|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: North's case for 6@S is that parner must have many spades to bid "5 over 5" in front of partner, and the kings figure to be onside in opener's hand|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|sfoxa:  seems so|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: would have been a dream had 4@H made in the other room  IE|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If West's double is penalty showing values in diamonds he cannot have the right cards|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|athene: i should have thought the @DK lead is far less likely to give away a trick|pg||
nt|athene: you know the @DA is almost certainly over you|pg||
nt|athene: but club lead could have found declarer with the queen|pg||
nt|andyv:  the lack of spot cards in the @d suit makes it almost even odds with a @c lead|pg||
nt|athene: or even something like Jxx with declarer, AQx in dummy|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the pips in diamonds are poor so I go with Easts lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ciaran: Good try from Micheal - hoping partner has @HKx |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 8 i guess with everyone bidding close vul games these days, defenders shd also be trigger happy on the double button when the trumps break badly|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|james_h: and struck gold|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yep|pg||
nt|james_h: another example of fortune favouring the bold|pg||
nt|petergill: Part of the case for North to pass 5@S is that if 5@s scores 680 it might be a pick-up anyway against 200 or 500 at the other table|pg||
nt|petergill: 650 is still secure|pg||
nt|petergill: South could claim 650 if he wants to|pg||
nt|petergill: Well done to R L Kejriwal team, who join Formidables and two other teams in the 48 board semi finals|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: don't think East ruffed that @CK |pg||
nt|xenya: not exactly an inspired defence?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d4|nt|sunsamvar: This is a great hand for the 1nt opener to be showing a 5-5 in majors and getting his ptr to declare 4 of a major|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|petergill: A @d back --> ruff, trump king, club ruff high, draw trumps |pg||
mc|11|nt|frankaus: bye all|pg||
