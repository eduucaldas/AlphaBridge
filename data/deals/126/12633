nt|vugraphzcz: little slow table to start but the smokers are at this table|pg||
nt|hedyg: good afternoon from sunny Geneva :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and from "snowy" Copenhagen|pg||
nt|hedyg: our operator is Patrick Bocken, hi Patrick :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Hans|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: No snow 20 km North|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: no "weak" 2 suiter opening in N|pg||
nt|hedyg: might have considered opening 1@s anyhow|pg||
mb|p|nt|wiki: hello again - 8 more boards|pg||
nt|k ylinen: pas,kun on 11ap ja tasainen|pg||
nt|rodal f: A realy good quality at that @S for the bid:))))|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi Juho, Markku, Roland, kibs!|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Welcome back! Hi Markku P, Kalle and Juho|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And good morning to Markku M MÃ¤kelÃ¤|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|k ylinen: hi|pg||
nt|mmmakela: NS play modified Blue Club w 4c majs and canapes|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Rodal and all welcome|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|kaapo2:  NS play Blue Club|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: not splinter|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1-suiter|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: suction|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i believe|pg||
nt|mmmakela: after 64 boards lots of imps have been scored|pg||
nt|runnerup: lucky slam to start|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: hi everyone, wlc|pg||
mb|3D|an|fit jump|nt|rodal f: Hi all:) Nice to be here|pg||
nt|hedyg: can they stop before 4@s now?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@D= @ss + @ds|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H by E now?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  E/W can make 6 @C, nor 6 @H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hawe45:  Easy play here - all suitys behave|pg||
nt|hedyg: check for 4 @ss|pg||
nt|wiki: 5 @S optimum as EW can make 5 1C or @D|pg||
nt|wiki: @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: hand when you know pd has @s:s but u wanna play in @h :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: now we see -now we didnt -i think south must transfer to clubs|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 clubs now?|pg||
nt|runnerup: ew makes 2 clubs ns 2 diamonds |pg||
nt|hawe45:  - on a @S-lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Hans|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hi Frank|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Frank|pg||
nt|rodal f: U2 Hedy:))|pg||
nt|hedyg: lead likely to be @D by both N and S now|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcz: 2 aces and the correct singelton, so missed a slam on this one|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kaapo2:  Holding a 4-card major, North usually would open with the major|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. But 3@H at least is on|pg||
nt|k ylinen: N passed with 11 hcp and balanced as system requires so|pg||
nt|runnerup: now sure|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Team SaTu was up by 50 IMPs after yesterday - but the lead was cut down to 17 IMPs during the first 8 board segment today|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i thought E would have bid 2@s|pg||
nt|mmmakela: N took a risk, S might not have dias suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i suppose S may correct to 2N since N showed max|pg||
nt|runnerup: six any from west is ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 6@d about finding @dQ (or 6@s by W)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: why didn't E bid 3 dias?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kaapo2:  That's why South gets to bypass her 4-card @H suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  For what reason 1 @D from North - and not 1 C???|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c-3@H-3NT= not intterested in @Hs looking for @ss|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Hello|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Kaapo|pg||
nt|k ylinen: tough bidding|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Still 24 boards to play|pg||
nt|mmmakela: normally N has 5 dias for this bid|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  Good evening Raija :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last time it went 1@S  4@H  declarer was in a 0-0 fit. Sadly, it wasn't on vugraph|pg||
nt|wiki: bur probably 3 pass here|pg||
nt|miniemin: East-West "Ranna Ruutu"  system from Estonia|pg||
nt|rnmalik: small @D and after @SA @D return some guessing by the declarer|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But 1 @S Pass 4@S would have worked better here|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: hi all, JM Boite is taking over|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty Patrick|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: because with 4 4 they open 1@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is systemic|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I see - but why?|pg||
nt|wiki: but - sorry about my fingers :(|pg||
nt|wiki: hello again and welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: you could bid 4@c asking pd to trf to his suit, then pass the 4@h response|pg||
nt|mmmakela: didn't know promised max|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Jean-Marc :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Interesting: Fist in hand, everybody would open the S-hand - nor the North-hand, which is clearly better! |pg||
nt|hawe45:  First|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: hi all, 1st time on duty|pg||
nt|hedyg: gl to you :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rodal f: Test the @C for the hook and 3-3. If not 3-3 u need to hit the @D, but here the @C works|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi Mikko!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: because when the bidding goes 1@d-1@s-X he can bid 2@c without 4@hs and no @s stopper|pg||
nt|doctorone: Frankly, I would just have bid 3N as S. See where we are now. But as it is our day, we will survive in 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: but 3NT shows 4@ss to me|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I do hope, that the survival will be in 4 NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would bid 3@s without them and 3NT with them|pg||
nt|doctorone: I meant over 2NT, bidding 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: why give up on finding a 4 4 @s fit?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  This is a sequence it's good to have an agreement on so that you don't get to play in a 1-0 fit|pg||
nt|runnerup: changes for +1|pg||
pc|c5|nt|peachy: this should make max 7 tricks if lucky|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Ah, Roland has 0-0|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi specs and vug operator:)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes south had dimonds but very weak opening otherwise-perhaps lucky + score anyhow|pg||
nt|hedyg: a quick -1? or....|pg||
nt|hedyg: E played his smallest @C for @d and S falsecarded to show the 2@c in E..|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  But hard to find the killing @d-lead against 4 NT...|pg||
nt|hedyg: pd will NEVER bid over 3NT ....:(|pg||
nt|miniemin: Hi Markku|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|hawe45:  Good by to a plus-score|pg||
nt|doctorone: I don't want to open a debate... I know how many positions about this issue exist, but I don't like bidding 2N with 4@s... So my problem is solved. I know, they are drawbacks of ...|pg||
nt|doctorone: course|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In fact, 4 @H can NEVER mak - if not South plays @H to the 10, he is short of entries|pg||
nt|peachy: prob six|pg||
nt|oliverc: .|pg||
nt|wiki: both pairs playing  strong club|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|oliverc: Well that sequence owed more to Culbertson than anything CC Wei might have|pg||
nt|oliverc: come up with :)|pg||
nt|wiki: now 420|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now 9 is good|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|doctorone: good lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: coded 9s?|pg||
nt|doctorone: seems so, or just a falsecard, in front of N's opening?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbx: stephan thinks|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: only with @s lead this is 9 tricks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: Re hi:)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|oliverc: but who are we to argue with success?|pg||
nt|muppe: +1 now it seems. Defence would have done its best with trump lead or switch at trick 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Kursat Ozsahin|pg||
nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
nt|hedyg: he needs A@d to be in W to make this|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|hawe45:  Tha was killing (the) defence|pg||
nt|runnerup: with 9 diamonds 6 can be found if east supports i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: no such luck|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kaapo2:  I think EW play strong club with 5-card majors and 14-16 1NT|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

nt|rodal f: If any like to use BBO-TV: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: W:s comment was that he didn't like the chances of making that contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: but considering the situation of the match, he felt he had to bid it|pg||
nt|runnerup: 6nt is the other possibility because it can be plaised to west|pg||
nt|mmmakela: "nice" fit EW here|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any like to use BBO-TV: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|hedyg: Jean-Marc will enter the missing names asap|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@c -1 on @s finesse|pg||
mb|2H|an|majors|nt|peachy: game both sides here|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: good max E has here|pg||
nt|vbman: some might open with e|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  In the open room, they weren't sure if 4@H was a splinter or not, resulting in playing in 4@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Any 1@D for major?|pg||
nt|runnerup: normal loking 4 hearts|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Strong club all around in this match. NS hear play a Precision-style system with 14-16 NT, and EW strong club with control responses, and 4-card majors|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  *here|pg||
nt|runnerup: a borderline game 3nt or better 5 diamonds -difficult both|pg||
nt|runnerup: some chance to over bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: now ossi can pass|pg||
mb|3C|nt|miniemin: 2@C = 6-10 hcp , majors at least 5-4 or 4-5|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2 positive things, dias hook working and spades 3-3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But with 2 @H showing majors, N/S will know better|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  How can E/W get a trick against a @H-slam?|pg||
nt|oliverc: I'd certainly open the East hand. Precision tends to lose the Diamond suit a bit,|pg||
nt|oliverc: since the 1@D Opening is more of a catch-all and in classic precision can easily|pg||
nt|oliverc: have as few as 2 Diamonds|pg||
nt|wiki: shorter than in Ostende :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: canape opening in use|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hawe45:  7 @C looks like only 1100|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and clubs 33|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  Yes, could be a swing board|pg||
nt|muppe: 4@h will probably make, will they bid it?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  4@C should do it|pg||
nt|vbman: i dont think its gf |pg||
nt|vbman: ah there|pg||
nt|vbman: 4 card support makes s hand a giant|pg||
nt|wiki: maybe not in red|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not u W. Was thinking abough S:)|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Well judged|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i don't like that bid with only 3 card support|pg||
nt|k ylinen: limit Stenberg|pg||
nt|runnerup: this makes so good start for satu |pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: huge triumph for satu to play in 2 @C making|pg||
mb|p|nt|doctorone: would you support @cs as E?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Or may-be 1400 because of the bad trump-split|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d looks like a waste of time|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would pass - or bid 5 @C|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Unless EW think otherwise|pg||
nt|oliverc: Yes, the overcall will make it easier for NS to get to this slam|pg||
nt|k ylinen: I do|pg||
nt|k ylinen: 5-4 and not minimum|pg||
nt|runnerup: Väiski seems to bid that support instead of 1 spades |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: can u play 4@s still if opener shows suit there?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes 1 @S response stands out|pg||
pc|s3|nt|peachy: I suppose Makela doubted whther 4H makes because he only bid 3S|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  1@D could be short if 11-13 balanced, so EW don't really know about the huge double fit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Coffe time again:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 3@h would be -1 if u find the @c ruff|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  This is the last 8-board segment of this 80-board qualification match. The winners get the right to play for Finnish seniors in the 2010 Europeans in Ostend, Belgium|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: NS are discussing the bidding|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs to duck the @d switch|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ItÂ´s OK to cover the second @D from West - this time|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: i really prefer 3@c over 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i'd like to bid 1@s instead of 2 with the S hand|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Looking at EW's cards, 5@C looks to have just 3 losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 5@c could be -2 but on a @h lead it would make|pg||
nt|muppe: Easy 10 tricks it seems|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Welcome to Markku Pekkinen|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5 dias here better than 3 nt|pg||
nt|rodal f: A new try from S?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rodal f: Came|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 5@c|pg||
nt|wiki: pass was ok now when 3 NT is not quite makeable|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: north asking lots of questions to east|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mmmakela: well heart lead and right guess...|pg||
nt|runnerup: they really liked to take away trumps from dummy|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kaapo2:  Of course @D ruff takes it 2 down|pg||
nt|vbman: close your eyes and bid the slam:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: south is gonna bid it after the 2NT call|pg||
nt|rodal f: I wonder if S would have leaded @HA in 5@C. Take a look and see what would have happend if not|pg||
nt|rodal f: As 3@S is on two|pg||
nt|k ylinen: he could, because system requires 5 cards to 1S bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps south is weak for her 3 diamond can they stop|pg||
nt|runnerup: now hearts lets this home but can n lead something else |pg||
nt|rnmalik: It is an interesting hand|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzcz: now an overtrick|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Friendly match - E/W passing...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|muppe: Yes, but hard to bid it looking at W´s cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. 2@S|pg||
nt|mmmakela: what is the best line in 4 hearts?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Stole spot since 4@C is on|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|rodal f: Non at open so I have to leave. See u later might.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kaapo2:  5@C that is|pg||
nt|oliverc: wd|pg||
nt|vbman: cool|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|mmmakela: still wondering how could anyone open E hand w 7-4 showing majors, I'd treat it as spades only|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|peachy: i liked 2S better, no defense except potential slow club|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kaapo2:  This is the third segment of 8 boards out of 10. After this segment, there will be a late lunch and the restart is then at 15:30 local time (14:30 CET)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|sT|pg||

nt|hedyg: wd|pg||
mc|10|nt|vugraphzcz: i like this line|pg||
nt|runnerup: now +1|pg||

nt|mmmakela: sry priv|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  At least one of the kibitzers was a little confused, so I'll clarify: all of these players are from Finland, but EW use an Estonian bidding system, Ranna ruutu, or Beach Diamond|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK - you shall beat 3 NT, facing a partner, who did bid but nothing over 3 @C - @d-lead not out of question|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcg: back|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  You can make 5 @C by finessing the @H 8!|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Quite nice a hand at West|pg||
nt|muppe: indeed|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Does Juho know any Rabbis?|pg||
nt|oliverc: exactly, so maybe 5@C a more helpful cue-bid than 4@S|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Did Timo not bid 3@S already?|pg||
nt|wiki:  4 @S here but  only DD|pg||
nt|runnerup: seems 4h+1 or +2 -if you guess all but a lot can happen here|pg||
nt|runnerup: but then you down get lucky + score --very lucky board for brothers|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|peachy: is NS also playing some strong club variant?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will they be taken? Only a partscore for EW|pg||
nt|runnerup: a diamond ruff set 6 and this opening will make difficulties|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: would anyone bid on with N:s hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: opponent most often have both major fits|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I would |pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzcg: steven "reevaluating his @d single"|pg||
mb|p|nt|wiki: maybe entry problem even dd|pg||
nt|rodal f: By DD y Wiki. Would u be there? |pg||
nt|rodal f: But I belive they will end there. Vul for EW|pg||
nt|wiki: unfortunately  - but 1 or 2 down|pg||
nt|wiki: but 3 NT has its chances as always|pg||
nt|runnerup: seems difficult to bid to best contract -2 hearts ,but now possible|pg||
nt|k ylinen: 5 imps to Cassini in first played deal|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3 lubs best but also spades makes |pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT by S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  8 easy tricks in 3 NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: lebensohl apply here?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Or was he too strong for it :)|pg||
nt|vbman: no doubletons for 3 sp|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: you mean the obvious 8@H finesse?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Could be. They haven't played together very regularly but usually play strong club in most of their partnerships|pg||
nt|peachy: kib confirmed Einari-risti|pg||
nt|k ylinen: tough bidding again|pg||
nt|hedyg: no need to stayman with 4 3 3 3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hawe45:  Sry 4 @C...|pg||
nt|doctorone: but wait.... Dont you loose 1@d and 2@hs ?|pg||
nt|rodal f: And the conceratisme pays?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 H huge underbid imo|pg||
nt|runnerup: wd and nothing to play ==|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Played by South, West might give away 3 NT with a @H--lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: going off in 3NT is no big deal as that should be a push|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzcz: @d ruff beats 6|pg||
nt|runnerup: n thinging to 1nt or 2 d|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: blocked the 2@c bid from E|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: steven has a definite advantage since he played tom's system for years|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hawe45:  Yes - T removed to 4 @C|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Both pairs here use strong club|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  NS play Einari club, a common system in Finland, especially in the Turku area. It has 4-card majors and control-showing responses to strong club|pg||
nt|mmmakela: good for NS|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|peachy: Einari club, close relative of Blue Club|pg||
nt|muppe: Slam makes only IF declarer drops @dK|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: why do you ask?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  EW use Blue Club, an old Italian system with canape style and also control responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: does a safe line of play exist here?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think W would lead J@d and not from an ace|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hawe45:  Has North not paid his entry fee - PASS...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Tough to beat 2@d though.|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Joe :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps east was worried cause he only had 2 hearts|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzcz: but can't be bid missing 2 aces|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  No Rabbis around, so slam is destined to go down|pg||
nt|runnerup: but this is 1 down so 2 ims or so possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: coenraets in the "tank"|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: Conservatisme|pg||
nt|k ylinen: according to their system Eeva should have opened 4 and a half D*s|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: kinda difficult to do that|pg||
nt|runnerup: control problems how to make this so that you dont loose clubs|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no safe line|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  So the 1@S opening is often just 4 cards|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kaapo2:  I thinks Timo is quite aggressive in bidding to the 3-level. Of course 2@S looks just fine for me|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mmmakela: winning 1/2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Dan Bylund|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Wow|pg||
pc|h7|nt|muppe: 6@d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: Timo is again hoping for @cQ/@hQ or @sK onside|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kaapo2:  Timo thinks he's good at guessing trump kings I suppose|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  SaTu stands for Salo-Turku, two cities in South-West Finland. "Satu" is also a Finnish word, meaning a fairy tale|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: not the best option he could hv choosen it seems|pg||
nt|rnmalik: if the @H are divided 3/2 the declarer has 6@C tricks:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kaapo2:  And to Kalle Ylinen, who will give some comments on the system played by EW|pg||
nt|k ylinen: yes u r right|pg||
nt|k ylinen: really?|pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps 2nt --4h|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mmmakela: really Väinö played low|pg||
nt|k ylinen: good for him|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: really|pg||
nt|mmmakela: why H K if S had A singl?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|k ylinen: hi all|pg||
pc|c4|nt|runnerup: perhaps was not a god idea to play small to first heart round|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  The East player here, Jarmo Laakso, was recently chosen the President of the Bridge League of Finland|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|diaoff: Morning Roland, hi all|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Kalle|pg||
nt|rodal f: A friendly but understandable lead from N|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ups|pg||

nt|mmmakela: down we go|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Dan|pg||

pc|c2|nt|rodal f: But by K9@H left it dose not cost:)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
mc|10|nt|hedyg: another @H now|pg||
nt|k ylinen: E-W are playing Big club based on Precision|pg||
nt|hedyg: sometimes tricks grow out of nothing..|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What did I say? 8 easy tricks...|pg||
nt|hedyg: W made a slight mistake, she should have stayed passive|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But from where did the overtrick come? 400 is correct|pg||

nt|mmmakela: hard to stay low|pg||
nt|mmmakela: nice major game here, must avoid 5-level|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: and has quite a temperament|pg||
nt|runnerup: now very close situation|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2 bad plays in a contract mr. Pekkinen said nothing in the play was enough to bring it down|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: at least now he has|pg||
nt|rnmalik: partial both sides|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk4: We are in Helsinki, the capital of Finland, for the Finnish Seniors Qualifications (European Championships in Belgium in June)|pg||

nt|oliverc: SaTu team|pg||
nt|vbman: the non innocent slam hand gained 13|pg||
nt|wiki: about 2 @H by N - maybe EW try 3 @C|pg||
nt|runnerup: ns can make 4 spades ,but a pre-emp will come|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  They started with 7-8 in order to get the comparisons before the board is played|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzcg: this will go quick I think|pg||
mb|d|nt|peachy: I've heard its been cold winter there, still cold and snow?|pg||
nt|k ylinen: and later to world championships in USA!|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: pretty good hand for 14-16 opening|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes very hard in teams at least|pg||
nt|k ylinen: D now|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 in a major ,but south can bid minors so a battle and card dont lie too well|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|garnetts: I was wondering what East would bid--too  good for a 14-16 1NT |pg||
nt|garnetts: I don't like because of both the shape and hard values |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: she could have opened 1@c (16+) but chose against it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Showing the majors vulnerable with 4-4 is not my cup of tea|pg||
nt|mmmakela: facing passed partner 2 NT seems best|pg||
nt|rnmalik: to me an action hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|doctorone: Oh my !|pg||
nt|doctorone: How easy for W is it to bid?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s a joke - show us, what West really vbid...|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  The other team is named after the space craft Cassini. That's because one of their players, VÃ¤inÃ¶ KelhÃ¤ playing in the open room, had a part in designing some scientific equimpent for Cassini|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 4@h is makeable here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  It's been colder than in recent years yes. Between -20 and -30 celcius on many days here in JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤ middle-Finland|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree with that too Roland|pg||
nt|wiki: most players do not like to open weak  with 4-6 majors and I do not like it here as @Hs are bad|pg||
nt|runnerup: east is not a chicken -he bid a lot|pg||
nt|runnerup: can south pass|pg||
nt|k ylinen: now pass?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now miracle pass needed|pg||
nt|k ylinen: I think so|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and duly bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps east should jump to 4 h|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H preemptish|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and should make 140|pg||
pc|c4|nt|doctorone: no, no... Hans. This is true|pg||
nt|k ylinen: yes we have exceptionally lots of snow even in Helsinki|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And close to -20 and lots of snow even in the South|pg||
nt|peachy: optimum reached at the table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D asking for the longer majors. Ha!|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Should Kanerva bid 4? Seems a bit hard with the wasted @DQ but he does have a singleton and a good side suit|pg||
nt|runnerup: sorry easnt prepared to that diclare play|pg||
pc|c5|nt|muppe: 5 imps to SaTu in first brd, other room played 1NT+1|pg||
nt|vbman: maybe its timefor a convention|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So you bid hearts with equal length|pg||
nt|wiki: funny that you over ruff when you have 5 @C in hand - but those things happen:)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|k ylinen: tough competition|pg||
nt|diaoff: Yes, good pressure by NS|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But unusual that West bid again. For all he knows, partner might want to defend|pg||
nt|mmmakela: for sure|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes you see missed|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: anything can happen against blue clubbers|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

nt|runnerup: yes how to show you have 5-5 ..|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vbman: 1nt l mean?|pg||
nt|garnetts: I can see the east hand is awkward for 1@C strong  --what about 1@D and you are a point too good?  |pg||
nt|wiki: @C lead helps  but is normal|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: a super max 1nt opening by north|pg||
pc|s3|nt|muppe: And in the 2nd board Cassine takes 3 imps back. Other room found 5@cx -2|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: always play the @h6 at first opportunity|pg||
nt|oliverc: That's no doubt one of the reasons East chose the opening|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Well, I need to be going soon. Have fun here!|pg||
nt|oliverc: I'd be happy enough to open 1@D and reverse into the Hearts given the chance|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not only do we not like the 2@C bid but I suspect we hate the 3@H bid too|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And partner often cannot raise when 4 is on|pg||
nt|mmmakela: lot of playing strength and supermax playing strong club|pg||

nt|mmmakela: honestly u pass in teams Markku? in pairs understandable|pg||

nt|muppe: This 4@s should have been doubled|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i have heard of the super bowl. giants on steroids trying to knock each other down. riveting|pg||
nt|daman: looks like EW will pick up another 12 IMPs here|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks safe enough even with the trump split|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|nt|roswolf: in which case another 12/13 back to the trailing team|pg||

pc|s4|mc|11|nt|vugraphzcf: indeed 135-116|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they played it from the better side. If W plays it and N leads club, correct play makes only ten tricks. ducking the club is 100% but rising ace goes down in cold contract if N has ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sneakily led from KTx of clubs with D ace |pg||
nt|roswolf: or even 19:)|pg||

nt|ralfwil: why not?|pg||
nt|roswolf: provided he gives west his spade ruff|pg||
nt|ralfwil: What shall N play if E plays low?|pg||
nt|xenya: E can win and play 2 more trumps -- he will get 3 trumps, 2 spades and a diamond for down 2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|daman: good opportunity for the trailing team to gain a little ground|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|xenya: alternatively he can play a  spade for the same number of tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: surrised at the long thought now - he should have thought before winning the lst trick|pg||
