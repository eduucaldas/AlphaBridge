nt|sybarra: tourney web site |pg||
nt|peachy: and off we go, enjoy the match|pg||
nt|sybarra: great misfit to begin with |pg||
nt|peachy: the tournament website did not have them unless I completely missed it|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|chick: probably play in a NT partscore somewhere|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Morning from DK - and doÂ´nt get surprised, if E/W will start with 420 - og maybe 450, depending on the lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|marlowepi: misfit perhaps but very close to 3N|pg||
nt|chick: or 2@C :)|pg||
nt|peachy: or 3|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|peachy: i would certainly raise clubs as S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N by N would make|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|chick: 3N doesn't look very makeable to me, but I'm sure you're right :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Conservative view by Sally Brock here opposite 15-17, but it often pays off at matchpoints|pg||
nt|marlowepi: natural diamond lead from E, two rounds of clubs, over fast|pg||
nt|peachy: 5C happens to make also, right?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: y|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: very good auction|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: N appreciates his primey hand|pg||
nt|peachy: found the best place|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|chick: pretty amazing lead :)|pg||
nt|peachy: tricky lead...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: logical lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N marked with heart shortness|pg||
nt|peachy: heart indicated by auction, so what can he do, ignore logic, but it is still ricky...|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|peachy: tricky :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes  gutsy move |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: And there is no game in spades, what about notrumps?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and no more trumps |pg||
nt|chick: certainly solves the problem of the diamond loser, so it was a no-risk finesse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she just has to decide which red suit to finesse. heart hook also logiocal--if E had D card but no heart card, probably a D lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html       tourney site|pg||
nt|peachy: i think best the diamonds before getting to board with S ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well if there are 2 trump losers and D queen is on but heart king off, it is not no risk--it goes down in a makeable contract|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S-return kept West in 420 |pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: North will likely put dummy back in|pg||
nt|hlortz: even if e transfers and bids 2n, w likely to pass with 15 and no @S fit|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: Right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, it's a very good 15 count with a strong 5-card suit|pg||

nt|marlowepi: another possible slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: correct play makes it|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: even on best lead of D ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: may be forced to play correctly no entry to dummy |pg||
nt|marlowepi: D king|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  SouthÂ´s 2 @S must be a minimum-hand...|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in clubs dummy has about 6 entries|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But only a @S-lead is good for the defense|pg||
pc|s2|nt|peachy: oops|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry I was talking about 2 @S |pg||
pc|s4|nt|jbgood: i'd rather double 2@c than 4 @h|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: NS do quite well in diamonds, but the club break is awkward|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: never said it was easy to get to slam:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hlortz: the 4-0 trump break will beat this i think|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jbgood: an unlucky downer (2?)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, with @hs 4-0 and North with a doubleton @s This wont be nice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can consider yourself very unlucky to go two down opposite four trumps|pg||
nt|hlortz: s taps the dummy to shut out the long spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: From Brock's point of view I mean|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session1.htm  for standings after session 1|pg||

pc|sA|pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|sT|pg||

nt|peachy: not opening lead|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|jtr: Yes fair point|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, it did, but it possibly should not have done|pg||
