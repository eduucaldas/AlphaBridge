nt|k ylinen: pas,kun on 11ap ja tasainen|pg||
nt|rodal f: A realy good quality at that @S for the bid:))))|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi Juho, Markku, Roland, kibs!|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Welcome back! Hi Markku P, Kalle and Juho|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And good morning to Markku M MÃ¤kelÃ¤|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|k ylinen: hi|pg||
nt|mmmakela: NS play modified Blue Club w 4c majs and canapes|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Rodal and all welcome|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  NS play Blue Club|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: not splinter|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1-suiter|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: suction|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i believe|pg||
nt|mmmakela: after 64 boards lots of imps have been scored|pg||
nt|runnerup: lucky slam to start|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: hi everyone, wlc|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: Hi all:) Nice to be here|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Easy play here - all suitys behave|pg||
nt|hedyg: check for 4 @ss|pg||
nt|wiki: 5 @S optimum as EW can make 5 1C or @D|pg||
nt|wiki: @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: hand when you know pd has @s:s but u wanna play in @h :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: now we see -now we didnt -i think south must transfer to clubs|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 clubs now?|pg||
nt|runnerup: ew makes 2 clubs ns 2 diamonds |pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzcz: 2 aces and the correct singelton, so missed a slam on this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  Holding a 4-card major, North usually would open with the major|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. But 3@H at least is on|pg||
nt|k ylinen: N passed with 11 hcp and balanced as system requires so|pg||
nt|runnerup: now sure|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Team SaTu was up by 50 IMPs after yesterday - but the lead was cut down to 17 IMPs during the first 8 board segment today|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i thought E would have bid 2@s|pg||
nt|mmmakela: N took a risk, S might not have dias suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i suppose S may correct to 2N since N showed max|pg||
nt|runnerup: six any from west is ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 6@d about finding @dQ (or 6@s by W)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: why didn't E bid 3 dias?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  That's why South gets to bypass her 4-card @H suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  For what reason 1 @D from North - and not 1 C???|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c-3@H-3NT= not intterested in @Hs looking for @ss|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Hello|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Kaapo|pg||
nt|k ylinen: tough bidding|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Still 24 boards to play|pg||
nt|mmmakela: normally N has 5 dias for this bid|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kaapo2:  Good evening Raija :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last time it went 1@S  4@H  declarer was in a 0-0 fit. Sadly, it wasn't on vugraph|pg||
nt|wiki: bur probably 3 pass here|pg||
nt|miniemin: East-West "Ranna Ruutu"  system from Estonia|pg||
nt|rnmalik: small @D and after @SA @D return some guessing by the declarer|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: because with 4 4 they open 1@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is systemic|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I see - but why?|pg||
nt|wiki: but - sorry about my fingers :(|pg||
nt|wiki: hello again and welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: you could bid 4@c asking pd to trf to his suit, then pass the 4@h response|pg||
nt|mmmakela: didn't know promised max|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rodal f: Test the @C for the hook and 3-3. If not 3-3 u need to hit the @D, but here the @C works|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi Mikko!|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|hedyg: because when the bidding goes 1@d-1@s-X he can bid 2@c without 4@hs and no @s stopper|pg||
nt|doctorone: Frankly, I would just have bid 3N as S. See where we are now. But as it is our day, we will survive in 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: but 3NT shows 4@ss to me|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I do hope, that the survival will be in 4 NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would bid 3@s without them and 3NT with them|pg||
nt|doctorone: I meant over 2NT, bidding 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: why give up on finding a 4 4 @s fit?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  This is a sequence it's good to have an agreement on so that you don't get to play in a 1-0 fit|pg||
nt|runnerup: changes for +1|pg||
pc|sK|nt|peachy: this should make max 7 tricks if lucky|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Ah, Roland has 0-0|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi specs and vug operator:)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|runnerup: yes south had dimonds but very weak opening otherwise-perhaps lucky + score anyhow|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  But hard to find the killing @d-lead against 4 NT...|pg||
nt|hedyg: pd will NEVER bid over 3NT ....:(|pg||
nt|miniemin: Hi Markku|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hawe45:  Good by to a plus-score|pg||
nt|doctorone: I don't want to open a debate... I know how many positions about this issue exist, but I don't like bidding 2N with 4@s... So my problem is solved. I know, they are drawbacks of ...|pg||
nt|doctorone: course|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In fact, 4 @H can NEVER mak - if not South plays @H to the 10, he is short of entries|pg||
nt|peachy: prob six|pg||
nt|oliverc: .|pg||
nt|wiki: both pairs playing  strong club|pg||
pc|s5|nt|oliverc: Well that sequence owed more to Culbertson than anything CC Wei might have|pg||
nt|oliverc: come up with :)|pg||
nt|wiki: now 420|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now 9 is good|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|doctorone: good lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: coded 9s?|pg||
nt|doctorone: seems so, or just a falsecard, in front of N's opening?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbx: stephan thinks|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: only with @s lead this is 9 tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rodal f: Re hi:)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|oliverc: but who are we to argue with success?|pg||
nt|muppe: +1 now it seems. Defence would have done its best with trump lead or switch at trick 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Kursat Ozsahin|pg||
nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Tha was killing (the) defence|pg||
nt|runnerup: with 9 diamonds 6 can be found if east supports i think|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kaapo2:  I think EW play strong club with 5-card majors and 14-16 1NT|pg||

nt|vbman: think it is going to get exiciting|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any like to use BBO-TV: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: W:s comment was that he didn't like the chances of making that contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: but considering the situation of the match, he felt he had to bid it|pg||
nt|runnerup: 6nt is the other possibility because it can be plaised to west|pg||
nt|mmmakela: "nice" fit EW here|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any like to use BBO-TV: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
mb|1D!|nt|peachy: game both sides here|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: good max E has here|pg||
nt|vbman: some might open with e|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  In the open room, they weren't sure if 4@H was a splinter or not, resulting in playing in 4@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Any 1@D for major?|pg||
nt|runnerup: normal loking 4 hearts|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Strong club all around in this match. NS hear play a Precision-style system with 14-16 NT, and EW strong club with control responses, and 4-card majors|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  *here|pg||
nt|runnerup: a borderline game 3nt or better 5 diamonds -difficult both|pg||
nt|runnerup: some chance to over bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: now ossi can pass|pg||
mb|1H|nt|miniemin: 2@C = 6-10 hcp , majors at least 5-4 or 4-5|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2 positive things, dias hook working and spades 3-3|pg||
mb|1S!|an|!c tfr or ?|nt|hawe45:  How can E/W get a trick against a @H-slam?|pg||
nt|oliverc: I'd certainly open the East hand. Precision tends to lose the Diamond suit a bit,|pg||
nt|oliverc: since the 1@D Opening is more of a catch-all and in classic precision can easily|pg||
nt|oliverc: have as few as 2 Diamonds|pg||
nt|wiki: shorter than in Ostende :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: canape opening in use|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  7 @C looks like only 1100|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and clubs 33|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kaapo2:  Yes, could be a swing board|pg||
nt|muppe: 4@h will probably make, will they bid it?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  4@C should do it|pg||
nt|vbman: i dont think its gf |pg||
nt|vbman: ah there|pg||
nt|vbman: 4 card support makes s hand a giant|pg||
nt|wiki: maybe not in red|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not u W. Was thinking abough S:)|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Well judged|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i don't like that bid with only 3 card support|pg||
nt|k ylinen: limit Stenberg|pg||
nt|runnerup: this makes so good start for satu |pg||
mb|d|nt|mmmakela: huge triumph for satu to play in 2 @C making|pg||
mb|3C|nt|doctorone: would you support @cs as E?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Or may-be 1400 because of the bad trump-split|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d looks like a waste of time|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would pass - or bid 5 @C|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Unless EW think otherwise|pg||
nt|oliverc: Yes, the overcall will make it easier for NS to get to this slam|pg||
nt|k ylinen: I do|pg||
nt|k ylinen: 5-4 and not minimum|pg||
nt|runnerup: Väiski seems to bid that support instead of 1 spades |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: can u play 4@s still if opener shows suit there?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes 1 @S response stands out|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I suppose Makela doubted whther 4H makes because he only bid 3S|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  1@D could be short if 11-13 balanced, so EW don't really know about the huge double fit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Coffe time again:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 3@h would be -1 if u find the @c ruff|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  This is the last 8-board segment of this 80-board qualification match. The winners get the right to play for Finnish seniors in the 2010 Europeans in Ostend, Belgium|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i really prefer 3@c over 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i'd like to bid 1@s instead of 2 with the S hand|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Looking at EW's cards, 5@C looks to have just 3 losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 5@c could be -2 but on a @h lead it would make|pg||
nt|muppe: Easy 10 tricks it seems|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Welcome to Markku Pekkinen|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5 dias here better than 3 nt|pg||
nt|rodal f: A new try from S?|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: Came|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: now 5@c|pg||
nt|wiki: pass was ok now when 3 NT is not quite makeable|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: north asking lots of questions to east|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mmmakela: well heart lead and right guess...|pg||
nt|runnerup: they really liked to take away trumps from dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  Of course @D ruff takes it 2 down|pg||
nt|vbman: close your eyes and bid the slam:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: south is gonna bid it after the 2NT call|pg||
nt|rodal f: I wonder if S would have leaded @HA in 5@C. Take a look and see what would have happend if not|pg||
nt|rodal f: As 3@S is on two|pg||
nt|k ylinen: he could, because system requires 5 cards to 1S bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps south is weak for her 3 diamond can they stop|pg||
nt|runnerup: now hearts lets this home but can n lead something else |pg||
nt|rnmalik: It is an interesting hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcz: now an overtrick|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Friendly match - E/W passing...|pg||
pc|s8|nt|muppe: Yes, but hard to bid it looking at W´s cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. 2@S|pg||
nt|mmmakela: what is the best line in 4 hearts?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Stole spot since 4@C is on|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|rodal f: Non at open so I have to leave. See u later might.|pg||

pc|s3|nt|peachy: i liked 2S better, no defense except potential slow club|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kaapo2:  This is the third segment of 8 boards out of 10. After this segment, there will be a late lunch and the restart is then at 15:30 local time (14:30 CET)|pg||

nt|wiki: but ok for me|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: conservative here|pg||
nt|runnerup: Cassini seems to start strongly -to get back imps|pg||

nt|mmmakela: leading @S J wasn't "impossible" in this sequence (or small spade)|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 h ew|pg||

nt|mmmakela: no |pg||
nt|mmmakela: sry priv|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  At least one of the kibitzers was a little confused, so I'll clarify: all of these players are from Finland, but EW use an Estonian bidding system, Ranna ruutu, or Beach Diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcg: back|pg||
mb|1N!|an|5+!d|nt|hawe45:  You can make 5 @C by finessing the @H 8!|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Quite nice a hand at West|pg||
nt|muppe: indeed|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Does Juho know any Rabbis?|pg||
nt|oliverc: exactly, so maybe 5@C a more helpful cue-bid than 4@S|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Did Timo not bid 3@S already?|pg||
nt|wiki:  4 @S here but  only DD|pg||
nt|runnerup: seems 4h+1 or +2 -if you guess all but a lot can happen here|pg||
nt|runnerup: but then you down get lucky + score --very lucky board for brothers|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|peachy: is NS also playing some strong club variant?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will they be taken? Only a partscore for EW|pg||

nt|wiki: unfortunately  - but 1 or 2 down|pg||
nt|wiki: but 3 NT has its chances as always|pg||
nt|runnerup: seems difficult to bid to best contract -2 hearts ,but now possible|pg||
nt|k ylinen: 5 imps to Cassini in first played deal|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3 lubs best but also spades makes |pg||
mb|4H|nt|vbman: lebensohl apply here?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Or was he too strong for it :)|pg||
nt|vbman: no doubletons for 3 sp|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: you mean the obvious 8@H finesse?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Could be. They haven't played together very regularly but usually play strong club in most of their partnerships|pg||
nt|peachy: kib confirmed Einari-risti|pg||
nt|k ylinen: tough bidding again|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Sry 4 @C...|pg||
nt|doctorone: but wait.... Dont you loose 1@d and 2@hs ?|pg||
nt|rodal f: And the conceratisme pays?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 H huge underbid imo|pg||
nt|runnerup: wd and nothing to play ==|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcz: @d ruff beats 6|pg||
nt|runnerup: n thinging to 1nt or 2 d|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: blocked the 2@c bid from E|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: steven has a definite advantage since he played tom's system for years|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hawe45:  Yes - T removed to 4 @C|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Both pairs here use strong club|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  NS play Einari club, a common system in Finland, especially in the Turku area. It has 4-card majors and control-showing responses to strong club|pg||
nt|mmmakela: good for NS|pg||
pc|s3|nt|peachy: Einari club, close relative of Blue Club|pg||
nt|muppe: Slam makes only IF declarer drops @dK|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: why do you ask?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  EW use Blue Club, an old Italian system with canape style and also control responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: does a safe line of play exist here?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hawe45:  Has North not paid his entry fee - PASS...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Tough to beat 2@d though.|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Joe :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps east was worried cause he only had 2 hearts|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: but can't be bid missing 2 aces|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  No Rabbis around, so slam is destined to go down|pg||
nt|runnerup: but this is 1 down so 2 ims or so possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: coenraets in the "tank"|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodal f: Conservatisme|pg||
nt|k ylinen: according to their system Eeva should have opened 4 and a half D*s|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: kinda difficult to do that|pg||
nt|runnerup: control problems how to make this so that you dont loose clubs|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no safe line|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kaapo2:  So the 1@S opening is often just 4 cards|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kaapo2:  I thinks Timo is quite aggressive in bidding to the 3-level. Of course 2@S looks just fine for me|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mmmakela: winning 1/2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s8|nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Dan Bylund|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Wow|pg||
pc|h4|nt|muppe: 6@d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: Timo is again hoping for @cQ/@hQ or @sK onside|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Timo thinks he's good at guessing trump kings I suppose|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  SaTu stands for Salo-Turku, two cities in South-West Finland. "Satu" is also a Finnish word, meaning a fairy tale|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: not the best option he could hv choosen it seems|pg||
nt|rnmalik: if the @H are divided 3/2 the declarer has 6@C tricks:)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kaapo2:  And to Kalle Ylinen, who will give some comments on the system played by EW|pg||
nt|k ylinen: yes u r right|pg||
nt|k ylinen: really?|pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps 2nt --4h|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mmmakela: really Väinö played low|pg||
nt|k ylinen: good for him|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: really|pg||
nt|mmmakela: why H K if S had A singl?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|k ylinen: hi all|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps was not a god idea to play small to first heart round|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  The East player here, Jarmo Laakso, was recently chosen the President of the Bridge League of Finland|pg||
pc|d4|nt|diaoff: Morning Roland, hi all|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Kalle|pg||
nt|rodal f: A friendly but understandable lead from N|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ups|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: if i remember correctly, they also open 44 majors 1@s|pg||

nt|vugraphzcz: director ruled declarer to lose the trick where he revoked|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: so -3|pg||
nt|runnerup: this was 3. good board in a row for C -team|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  We'll soon get our first comparison, Open room is just about to finish board 1|pg||
nt|runnerup: a lot off points but no game on|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hard to stay low|pg||
nt|mmmakela: nice major game here, must avoid 5-level|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: and has quite a temperament|pg||
nt|runnerup: now very close situation|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2 bad plays in a contract mr. Pekkinen said nothing in the play was enough to bring it down|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: at least now he has|pg||
nt|rnmalik: partial both sides|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: We are in Helsinki, the capital of Finland, for the Finnish Seniors Qualifications (European Championships in Belgium in June)|pg||

nt|oliverc: SaTu team|pg||
nt|vbman: the non innocent slam hand gained 13|pg||
nt|wiki: about 2 @H by N - maybe EW try 3 @C|pg||
nt|runnerup: ns can make 4 spades ,but a pre-emp will come|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  They started with 7-8 in order to get the comparisons before the board is played|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzcg: this will go quick I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I've heard its been cold winter there, still cold and snow?|pg||
nt|k ylinen: and later to world championships in USA!|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: pretty good hand for 14-16 opening|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes very hard in teams at least|pg||
nt|k ylinen: D now|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 in a major ,but south can bid minors so a battle and card dont lie too well|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|garnetts: I was wondering what East would bid--too  good for a 14-16 1NT |pg||
nt|garnetts: I don't like because of both the shape and hard values |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: she could have opened 1@c (16+) but chose against it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Showing the majors vulnerable with 4-4 is not my cup of tea|pg||
nt|mmmakela: facing passed partner 2 NT seems best|pg||
nt|rnmalik: to me an action hand|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|doctorone: Oh my !|pg||
nt|doctorone: How easy for W is it to bid?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s a joke - show us, what West really vbid...|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  The other team is named after the space craft Cassini. That's because one of their players, VÃ¤inÃ¶ KelhÃ¤ playing in the open room, had a part in designing some scientific equimpent for Cassini|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 4@h is makeable here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  It's been colder than in recent years yes. Between -20 and -30 celcius on many days here in JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤ middle-Finland|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree with that too Roland|pg||
nt|wiki: most players do not like to open weak  with 4-6 majors and I do not like it here as @Hs are bad|pg||
nt|runnerup: east is not a chicken -he bid a lot|pg||
nt|runnerup: can south pass|pg||
nt|k ylinen: now pass?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now miracle pass needed|pg||
nt|k ylinen: I think so|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and duly bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps east should jump to 4 h|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|doctorone: no, no... Hans. This is true|pg||
nt|k ylinen: yes we have exceptionally lots of snow even in Helsinki|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And close to -20 and lots of snow even in the South|pg||
nt|peachy: optimum reached at the table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D asking for the longer majors. Ha!|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Should Kanerva bid 4? Seems a bit hard with the wasted @DQ but he does have a singleton and a good side suit|pg||
nt|runnerup: sorry easnt prepared to that diclare play|pg||
mb|p|nt|muppe: 5 imps to SaTu in first brd, other room played 1NT+1|pg||
nt|vbman: maybe its timefor a convention|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So you bid hearts with equal length|pg||
nt|wiki: funny that you over ruff when you have 5 @C in hand - but those things happen:)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|k ylinen: tough competition|pg||
nt|diaoff: Yes, good pressure by NS|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But unusual that West bid again. For all he knows, partner might want to defend|pg||
nt|mmmakela: for sure|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes you see missed|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: anything can happen against blue clubbers|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vbman: he lead beats it how many?|pg||

nt|runnerup: yes how to show you have 5-5 ..|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: 1nt l mean?|pg||
nt|garnetts: I can see the east hand is awkward for 1@C strong  --what about 1@D and you are a point too good?  |pg||
nt|wiki: @C lead helps  but is normal|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: a super max 1nt opening by north|pg||
pc|sA|nt|muppe: And in the 2nd board Cassine takes 3 imps back. Other room found 5@cx -2|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: always play the @h6 at first opportunity|pg||
nt|oliverc: That's no doubt one of the reasons East chose the opening|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Well, I need to be going soon. Have fun here!|pg||
nt|oliverc: I'd be happy enough to open 1@D and reverse into the Hearts given the chance|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not only do we not like the 2@C bid but I suspect we hate the 3@H bid too|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And partner often cannot raise when 4 is on|pg||

nt|mmmakela: no|pg||

mb|p|nt|diaoff: Guess that E is happy not to have entered this bidding, yes|pg||

mb|4C|nt|vbman: but passing is  a hard way to earn a living in bride|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  I suppose NS play 2-way Stayman, and 2@H and 2@S are weak, natural|pg||
nt|k ylinen: yes I hate to say that lots of pairs are still using two-way Stayman|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: 4@c alerted by south, not by north|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Only risk was an overtrick|pg||
nt|hedyg: players probably getting tired|pg||
nt|doctorone: sure, they are playing (the same 8 almost since 12:00)|pg||
nt|hedyg: been playing for almost 9 hours|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  They play 80 boards during the weekend|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Divided into 10 segments of 8 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: apparantely the convention was W:s idea|pg||
nt|vbman: yes true|pg||
nt|rodal f: b|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: Norths claim wasn't as accurate as it could have been|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: he said that he loses 2@d tricks if either defender has 5 of them|pg||
nt|wiki: of course it is ddown with @D lead as @HQ takes uppercut|pg||
nt|rodal f: A coffe board. Or a unluckey 6@S?|pg||
nt|wiki: no the worst comment from W: you had only 11 !!|pg||
nt|wiki: now|pg||
nt|k ylinen: 31 imps differense|pg||
nt|mmmakela: wonder why N kept the @S J.....|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes 500 in partscore board so good for satu this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|k ylinen: we see the differense of teams in deal 5. Sa(lo)Tu(rku) are much more aggressive|pg||
nt|Walddk4: A laydown slam now|pg||
nt|oliverc: @H game here for NS|pg||
nt|garnetts: The auction in the OR on the lsat hand was not well judged by West--total phantom save |pg||
nt|oliverc: EW will be disappointed if they compete too much here|pg||
nt|vbman: 4sp save here?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Many 4-1 in colors now|pg||
nt|runnerup: seems that we have about even situation to start next section |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 5@d had chances if W doesn't play @s:s early enough and declarer finesses @d:s|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt can be beating but not so clear to do so|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: he said he thought N promised an @s honour with the X|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4 spades here|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt/ 4s |pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: a quiet 4@h for N-S?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Too strong for 1 NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: fine for me|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Should not be too difficult to reach|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Ok, so West can say that "I was certain you couldn't remember it so I bid it as natural" :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: EW likely to outbid them in spades |pg||
nt|oliverc: 4@SX-2 too expensive|pg||
nt|vbman: ah yes |pg||
nt|vbman: colours|pg||
nt|oliverc: yup|pg||
nt|wiki: but it is a good 6 @H|pg||
mb|3D!|an|!h|nt|hedyg: surely not too strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|doctorone: It wouldnt cross my mind to take any actioon as N facing 15-17, NV.... But, when it is your day, it is your day|pg||
nt|diaoff: Yes, 6@D is best but @H and NT will also make|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am alone in not liking weak two bids on flat hands in first two seats |pg||
nt|wiki: my kind of 3 NT|pg||
nt|wiki: 1 @S and 2 @S by N|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@S and what will N bid by his 20HP|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks 4 hearts this time|pg||
nt|k ylinen: was there wrong information given?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@H can be made by giving E QTxx of @D otherwise  4@H cold|pg||
mb|3N!|an|!h fit (can't argue)|nt|hawe45:  This hand is worth 1 @C - 1 ? - 3 @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: so?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 x 10 + a 6-card.suit|pg||
nt|runnerup: partscore battle 2pades win perhaps |pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: Hate them|pg||
nt|wiki: @H10(11) lead makes it happy|pg||
nt|rodal f: :) Y|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: is 3@s enough for N?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@S is to weak for his hand. Telling (15)16-18|pg||
nt|k ylinen: rdbl?|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok this even makes|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt seems 97% but 4 spades needs something -about 85%|pg||
mb|4D!|an|re transfer|nt|wiki: ok - now RD|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  Other table already reached 6@H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the context of 12-16 2+ diamonds I don't think 2@D is enough|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hedyg: this hand has Kx Kx and wants to rightside NT, i agree|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now the test for East - not @D Queen|pg||
nt|mmmakela: because strong club W will settle in 4 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|diaoff: Agree|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's worth 3@D imo|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Looks like just making|pg||
nt|vbman: more to cassini|pg||
nt|sybarra: well they landed |pg||
nt|wiki: @D lead makes it almost fool proof|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes but hard to reach 3 nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: My bid would have been 2@H force for one round|pg||
nt|rodal f: RD are OK to. |pg||
nt|wiki: without D I thin 2 @S is almost enough in white but 2 @H is best for me(without D)|pg||
nt|rodal f: But RD can be taken for SOS|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so 5 from top for defence.......|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  But the suit (@D)= is frozen anywhere|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And since they started with boards 7-8, they've played 2 boards faster|pg||
pc|cA|nt|runnerup: yes but north has double stopper in hearts in this secuence|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Canape style 1@S. She could have any longer suit and just 4@S, or some balanced hands|pg||
pc|c8|nt|oliverc: no, to SaTu|pg||
nt|garnetts: This was meant to be 5@H and a minor --and look at how defensive the hand is |pg||
pc|c6|nt|rodal f: And here we go|pg||
nt|runnerup: not so easy to take them anyhow|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: very hard to beat this|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  I think 3@S here only guarantees 5 cards, but Erkki doesn't really have other choice than to raise|pg||
nt|mmmakela:   25 a push|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|Walddk4: 6@D is a good choice in case partner has xxx in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Qxx   xxx    in the majors and 6@H would fail whereas 6@D makes|pg||
nt|peachy: nice bidding|pg||
nt|diaoff: Exactly, but for me 6@D would have been a grand slam invitation in this auction|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Yes, good to be able to bid 6@D as a suggestion to play. I might have a fear that it's interpreted as a try for grand|pg||
nt|k ylinen: Väiski teki hyvän tarjouksen 4S, muttei se riittänyt Eevan slammihalujen torjumiseen|pg||
nt|runnerup: if this goes down i am very angry |pg||
pc|s4|nt|wiki: not sure, but I think that W bids are natural and so W thinks that she has a better hand|pg||

nt|wiki: KQx in W:s second suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Didn't get ure lead Wiki. So -1. Next|pg||
nt|wiki: Hardly as D always promises at least 3 @S or then stron minorhand|pg||
nt|rodal f: And after the pressed 2@S from S it's easyer for N to pass at level2|pg||
pc|h2|nt|runnerup: so made|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|mmmakela: E promising 5 spades |pg||
pc|hK|nt|rnmalik: lets see the play for 5 or 6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wiki: But with that balanced hand I think that also after D by W  2 @H is best bid|pg||
nt|wiki: so we can rest in 2 @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i would rather use the 2@h for some strong hands then for those with fit, 2/3/4@s would seem enough bids when u have @s:s|pg||
nt|runnerup: in hand with opening agains 12 points and single spade thy managed to stop in 2 spades to get + score|pg||

nt|runnerup: spades lies badly so normall loking result|pg||

nt|mmmakela: W dbld 1 @D opening in OR which I just can't understand|pg||
nt|runnerup: partscore battle 9 in hearts to get|pg||
nt|runnerup: +1 seemed to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: declarer claimed 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i asked him how many|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: he said 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: Cassini had an accident at other table|pg||
nt|runnerup: little expensive in other room -4 spades can even go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: south getting "some" hands|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|oliverc: East unlikely to look further than a p/s, though, and won't compete to the 4-lvel|pg||
nt|garnetts: Will east bid if North tries 2@S |pg||
nt|garnetts: Might if he plays a gadget |pg||
nt|oliverc: East knows they're out-gunned|pg||
nt|vbman: tx and a bypass|pg||
nt|wiki: good cards but funny that you cannot make even 3 @S|pg||
nt|k ylinen: I would listen more|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will EW gain some IMPs here? Belive now if E don't go bananas|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes ew bidding can make difference to open room |pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Other table also played 3@S on  4 so one missed chance for Cassini (they still one an overtrick IMP though)|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -he dint count because he was happy|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2 @C on supermisfit was a triumph as expected|pg||
mb|2S!|an|weak|nt|doctorone: I dont understand opening 1@c here as Fernando does... Sorry :)|pg||

nt|kaapo2:  *won|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no 1 NT?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Yes, if SaTu avoid the same accident, they are verrry close to winning this|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: he is trying to create swings|pg||
nt|doctorone: That, I understand :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: Well Leb would apply over 2@S by South|pg||
nt|rodal f: Neigher can NS make 3@D so the border passed for bought|pg||
nt|wiki: actually I think that S has more 1 @S opening that multi|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: did he miscount or downgrade|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Pirjo alerts a natural call?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Perhaps it's so standar to use this as a pre-emtpive raise that she thinks it better to alert :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: maybe i saw wrong, they do not use the alert card|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: bid of 5@D gives a choice of contract or DBL, thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: a pass is not an option...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes|pg||
mb|d|nt|k ylinen: with only 11 hcp and alanced hand W would have to pas, so now 12...13 p|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  600 is a strange result in this board but that was recorded in the open room|pg||
nt|vbman: 3sp better|pg||
nt|oliverc: 3@S by South now|pg||
nt|garnetts: Asking for the teach them a sharp lesson with 4@S |pg||
nt|garnetts: That will terrify East |pg||
nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: until it drifts off|pg||
nt|vbman: will loose the 1st 4 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: there is a chance of accident, since if E was strong she would have acted over 2@h, so why play 2N as Leb and not 2-suiter|pg||
nt|wiki: S playing - @H lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I am up for the adventure in 3 nt |pg||
nt|reisig: opening 1@h w 9xxx ..just goes against my grain|pg||
nt|Walddk5: It's against my religion|pg||
nt|wiki: that must ne 1 @S even in USA|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  Are 5 spades and an ace enough to pass the double?|pg||

nt|rodal f: And a @H lead for IMPs to NS who need some|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i put the explanation to 2N o what 2N is|pg||
nt|runnerup: can east pass?-no she did not|pg||
nt|runnerup: seems to make = here|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: though he should open 1@h if he downgraded, hmmm...|pg||
pc|c9|nt|diaoff: On a @H lead, declarer must be a bit careful on this one|pg||
nt|peachy: Wouldthat be true if he held xx diamonds?|pg||
nt|k ylinen: 2NT promised stoppers in both Majors|pg||
nt|k ylinen: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: she had only 2 tricks|pg||
nt|runnerup: Eki has to guess well or play well to make this|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: though if defence starts with 4 rounds of @d, E pitching 2@h:s|pg||
pc|c2|nt|oliverc: so a push after all that|pg||
nt|garnetts: Odd game isn't it--4@H laydown and the opps play a partscore  |pg||
nt|wiki: thanks Richie  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i have no idea|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzcz: at least the 1@d opening had a different meaning there|pg||
nt|runnerup: a lot of opening hands were pass seems best -like here -but old school says -double means =opening hand |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Next set is scheduled to start in ten minutes, so we're just about on time|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's natural to knock out @CA first and there goes the entry to the long hearts|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Ah right, 400|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: slam is makeable|pg||
nt|reisig: That suit ...looks like 3 cards|pg||

nt|kaapo2:  Moving on to the last board of the set, thanks Juho and Vesa|pg||
nt|muppe: Ty all|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Restart after a short break|pg||
nt|oliverc: Difficult to criticise EW, though. It's more likely that NS (with 23) will get too high|pg||
nt|oliverc: than that EW (with 17) will willingly bid anywhere near to game at unfavourable|pg||
nt|oliverc: vulnerability|pg||
nt|oliverc: 4@S NS here|pg||
nt|wiki: we are in Finland now, so it is nothing :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: but fair for public view @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 3@d didn't say anything about strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: opener could have full 16 count|pg||
nt|rodal f: Could be Markku. Nice to see u and welcome:)|pg||
nt|k ylinen: 40 imps differense now|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: since 2N was interested in only partscore or about slam|pg||
nt|wiki: maybe opener bid 3 NT with max ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: but our E forgot system|pg||
nt|wiki: ok|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  This match consists of 80 boards divided into 10 segments of 8 boards|pg||
nt|mmmakela: think Kanerva loses nothing returning a dia against any distribution|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes was endplayed but played it down |pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: What's that I hear from the green room?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  They'll compare scores, have a cig break, and then get back to action|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vbman: l think its better 3sp 1st round|pg||
mb|1N|an| natural or a 5-5 hand|nt|hedyg: 5 bds left|pg||
nt|wiki: the most natural reason|pg||
nt|wiki: to go wrong|pg||
nt|runnerup: here 2 spades makes|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I would treat S hand as 1-suiter|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes even Timo had a change to switch to his sing d -and then it is down allways|pg||
nt|mmmakela: good pass by Kelhä in OR|pg||
nt|mmmakela: erkki played for a practically no-chance when ruffed the club rerurn|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  This is our last board. Great thanks to our marvellous operators Juho GranstrÃ¶m here and Pauli Nieminen in the open room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we have had some fantastic boards:)|pg||
nt|varange: sorry I missed them|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: but still no swings :(|pg||
nt|varange: looks like a close score|pg||
nt|varange: systems, Rashed?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rodal f: The last board for this segment. When will the next start?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: any rabbi could make a slam here|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@H or 4@H is a good shot to keep the spades out of it --since partner has passed |pg||
nt|oliverc: 4@H?|pg||
nt|oliverc: (by North)|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Segment 8 is scheduled to start 11:10 local time (10:10 CET)|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|hedyg: sorry about the mistake in the title folks, this is the last segment|pg||
nt|santyclz: Do you have to be a rabbi to play @ds?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no but to catch the K@H|pg||
nt|garnetts: I mean as an overcall of 1@D |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: after cig break, i think|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks 3nt ofcause can overbid 15+15 so|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes no chance better that some lucky change -hmm..strange|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And thanks to two Markkus, Markku M MÃ¤kelÃ¤ and Markku Pekkinen, for comments|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Common sense:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: N-S play classic belgian system (similar to SEF= France)|pg||
nt|varange: that helps.|pg||
nt|varange: ah thanks|pg||
nt|varange: Common sense is so uncommon|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hahahahahah|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: E-W plays a strong @c system with many variations|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: why not bid 4@d here?|pg||
nt|doctorone: I would elect 4N !|pg||
nt|hedyg: pd is strong and short in @c, surely he is interested|pg||
mb|p|nt|k ylinen: 11 tricks in H here|pg||
nt|rodal f: A coffe board wich NS don't need|pg||
nt|wiki: 3 NT by S best|pg||
nt|mmmakela: here easier|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: but N can thank E for that|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Thanks also to the Bridge League of Finland for organising, and to Bridge Base Online for letting us show this exciting match|pg||
nt|runnerup: here is a slam but not good contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|k ylinen: what was dbl?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|wiki: not sure what 3 NT is, but looks like East should look for the minor|pg||
nt|runnerup: ofcause they can overbid-18+13 |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: S doesn't believe in slam w his 4333|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes seems that Eeva also-2 diamonds is onesuiter in heartrs or spades|pg||
nt|mmmakela: in OR seems they didn't|pg||
nt|runnerup: 6 clubs best |pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And of course thanks to all our kibitzers!|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: @c and @d 33 or oen of them with the other 24 and @h finesse?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk4: 4333 and 15 would make me choose 3NT over Stayman|pg||
nt|mmmakela: absolutely|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|santyclz: No xx to show a void?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d for me shows @d stopper and 2nd rd @c control|pg||
nt|doctorone: Surely the right thing to do, Joe|pg||
nt|garnetts: K@C looks like a switch too|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are we over for match point?:)))))|pg||
nt|mmmakela: K and dias|pg||
nt|runnerup: 5 spades can be only 1 down -best defence sets it -2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: surely accepts|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|hedyg: who should XX? where? what?|pg||
nt|garnetts: likley to get the spades right too I think |pg||
pc|h2|nt|doctorone: N|pg||
nt|hedyg: true, yes|pg||
nt|doctorone: over 4@c X P P|pg||
nt|reisig: dbl = I want to lose 800+|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: reisig is right|pg||
nt|k ylinen: yess|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: but the explanation at table was either @c:s or take-out of @c:s|pg||
nt|wiki: against me they always bid 6 NT and both finesses work|pg||
nt|wiki: just change the hands EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thats standard bridge Wiki:)|pg||
nt|k ylinen: wiki u r the lucky one|pg||
nt|varange: good to have someone at the venue who is knowledgeable, thanks|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|hedyg: sry getting tired here too|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Often used for the 2 lowest colors, but most use it for majors|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @HJ would be a good lead but no|pg||
nt|varange: risky low level dbl|pg||
pc|s6|nt|wiki: RKCB obviously is 2 from 5 without @HQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 30-32 between you, never mind Stayman|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Agree Roland. 1NT-3NT would look just about right|pg||
pc|sT|nt|reisig: 3N was a minor preempt ...I thk|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|runnerup: heart finess always and 4-2 can be handled in some cases makes it |pg||
nt|rnmalik: would not make|pg||
nt|varange: heart and another?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: one @H with the Q@D EW would have an edge|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: seems obvious from here :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: that is the advantage of seeing all cards:)|pg||
nt|varange: not easy from east's POV|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D switch|pg||
pc|d2|nt|wiki: red  makes it difficult of course|pg||
nt|runnerup: 5 still makes from south -but they bid 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: ok, this is doomed|pg||
nt|rodal f: Forget my coffe boards|pg||
nt|wiki: so 11 more to SaTu|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  NS use canape even in responses|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  So I suppose South has now shown better clubs than diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: here south could have 2-6 minors|pg||
pc|d3|nt|k ylinen: this is here again bad tactics, they are -40 Imp down, but ...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|reisig: to me ...3N is 99% forcing|pg||
nt|k ylinen: now home|pg||
nt|varange: well done|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|wiki: yes it looks like it|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 8 more to go ,SaloTurku close to victory|pg||
nt|mmmakela: must choose the right maj finesse|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: whats the hurry with @hs?|pg||
nt|miniemin: no|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s3|nt|vugraphzcz: both defenders trying to get ruffs|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|h9|nt|oliverc: Good set for SaTu|pg||
nt|runnerup: still 3 loosers|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|wiki: so this a good Roland slam(Ihad to say this) about 17 %|pg||
nt|runnerup: 2 loosers|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|runnerup: yes this session 18-18|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzcz: neither is giving them|pg||
nt|muppe: but neither will get|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  They'll compare and have a very short break and then change seats after this board|pg||
nt|varange: painfull now|pg||
nt|varange: for declarer|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|hedyg: come on play the @d!|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: now can go wrong|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s7|pg||
pc|h8|pc|sJ|nt|reisig: Went down in 5@h??|pg||
nt|wiki: much needed 11 for cassini|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  So we'll be back at 10 past the hour|pg||
nt|mmmakela: bad play but still makes|pg||
pc|s5|nt|oliverc: thanks everyone. bye for now|pg||
nt|vbman: bye|pg||
nt|garnetts: It looks odd not to finesse the club but if he crosses to dummy and finesses and it loses a @D back spoils the entries |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: we'll resume in 55min|pg||
nt|garnetts: bye for now|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Thanks, see you soon|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW had one board earlier where NS got of the hook. Been kindly that way|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzcz: overtrick, i think|pg||
nt|runnerup: cards sits well enough so even Eeva is worried this makes|pg||
nt|runnerup: was not the best way to play but makes -should have ruffed d to table|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: trying for 13, not happening|pg||
nt|varange: Patrick, please let him know it is pointless|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: cannot escape 3 down|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|s9|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzcz: i mean 2|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|c8|nt|k ylinen: sry|pg||
nt|rodal f: Better then 17%. I'd say 45%. @C covered 50% by a @D hook and a bit more of by 3-2@H|pg||
nt|k ylinen: now 50 imp diif|pg||
nt|k ylinen: differense|pg||
nt|wiki: hearts 3-2 and the needs 2 finesses ??But in Norway it is different:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: this was the last segment of the day|pg||

nt|hedyg: i dont know what EW are playing :(|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I recommand South NOT to bid @DÂ´s|pg||
nt|hedyg: E will bid first|pg||
nt|doctorone: They play 2/1|pg||
nt|hedyg: and S might double|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Bachar|pg||
nt|doctorone: not sure about this|pg||
nt|doctorone: I mean double by S :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To me, East has NO weak 2 @S|pg||
nt|hedyg: i did say might :)|pg||
nt|doctorone: why?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H-suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: to me E has a CLEAR weak 2 opening|pg||
nt|doctorone: a multi I suspect|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And the @S-suit is rather POOR|pg||
nt|doctorone: ah ok :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: Magnusson agrees with me |pg||
nt|hedyg: the @h suit doesnt exist|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: 10 more for bcob|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|varange: the unmakeable 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: yes, 4@h -1 in other room|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: you are very oldfashioned Hans?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I repeat: East has NO @S-suit for a multi|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|hawe45:  Must have some intermediates|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H was p/c|pg||
nt|varange: 2@d = solid raise of the overcall|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|hedyg: 4@s looks coldish|pg||
nt|hawe45:  11 tricks are easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: very solid :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i would have bid 2NT as W not 2@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: he made no effort towards game at all|pg||
nt|varange: yes, he has another bite of the cherry|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: north cannot do smthg else than bid 4@s|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|doctorone: agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: so can south|pg||
nt|varange: trial bid maybe|pg||
pc|c2|nt|varange: I don't see why south would bid the same cards twice|pg||
nt|rnmalik: over valued his hand|pg||
nt|varange: yes. A flat ten-pointer|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@D-2@S=ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: East will find the @h switch when in with @dQ|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|hawe45:  With a reasonable mulit in @S, West must bid game|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And if East starts with PASS, game is easy to be reached|pg||
nt|hedyg: if E starts with pass S openes 1@d and W passes!|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|varange: anyhow, the 2@d adequately describes it, and he should abide by p's decision|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
