nt|royhughes:  Dunn is a brave balancer.  I admire the courage|pg||
nt|royhughes:  In general, I don't like to let the opponents play below 2S when I have a decent spade suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|daman: not so easy to defend this one|pg||
nt|royhughes:  Some pairs have a basic understanding that you don't try for game against a strong NT opening, unless you have a really good fit|pg||
nt|daman: and with @Ss 3-3  they might just make it|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|royhughes:  The defence sort of has a club trick, but they can't set it up|pg||

nt|brolucius: West leads a low spot-card, so that East will put up the queen if she has it. Underleading aces is always dangerous, but when you lead through a 1NT or 2NT hand , you have some ...|pg||

nt|brolucius: Or to play it at all.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after having found @hJ there always is 8 tricks|pg||
mb|2C|an|intermediate|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I don't think it applies at the 4-level. Do you play that, Sabine?|pg||
mb|2D|an|relay asking for more information|nt|athene: cautious pass from south - 1@H looks the mainstream action|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|an| |nt|Walddk2: 1@S denies a major|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: East would have to avoid a passive trump lead against 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: a<nd shows 4+ diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S is specifically diamonds - and has to be, surely, for 3@D not to be insane :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|jcmax: South's original pass now made a fit-showing 3@H bid very easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Only the vulnerability deterred South from bidding 1@H.|pg||
nt|jcmax: When you don't bid a suit at a lower level given the opportunity, but then bit it later at a higher level, it usually means fit with partner's suit|pg||
nt|daman: a backhanded fit-jump|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Both sides have four losers in their short suits.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|daman: this looks like a push with the CR|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe doubling 2@D was better here. 3@H is a bit high.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|h5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|hlortz: at pairs might pass the double (and lead trump) but dangerous at IMPs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Against these openings, useful to play double of a relay as t/o of the opening suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so 2@C-2@D (r)-x=t/o of @c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Is this the best defence? 2 rounds of @s looks better fro me'|pg||
nt|ralfwil: of @c of course...|pg||

nt|brolucius: Ah, he has found the diamond lead.|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes 25 high cards but probably cant make a game|pg||

nt|daman: Barry Crane lovede defending and the one level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure what Frances has shown here. Maybe Jeffrey can message me|pg||
nt|athene: With North's black suits as they are, the penalty auction is more appealing since you expect opps to have to go to 2@C, not 1@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: By the way, much obliged if no-one mentions any football scores. I have the Sky+ box recording the action.|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||

nt|jcmax: wow! Balancing in a non-fit auction is often very dangerous....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not me, Jeffrey Allerton|pg||
nt|athene: I have to say, it looks more sensible for South to bid 1@S the first time rather than pass and come in later with 2@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|daman: nerves of steel|pg||
nt|athene: The fact that opps have stopped low (and hance don't have game values) is just irrelevant|pg||

nt|jcmax: 4@H looks like a very normal contract to reach. It only goes down on a very lucky lay-out. Both @H-honours offside and a @S-ruff out|pg||
nt|jcmax: unlucky lay-out I guess that is :)|pg||
nt|athene: mind you there is a chance|pg||
nt|athene: suppose north leads the @CQ instead of a low one|pg||

nt|daman: side bets|pg||
nt|brolucius: A pity. I was expecting some wonderful play after this long thought.|pg||
nt|jcmax: You make a good point. North shouldn't switch to the @CQ, but a low one when in with the @HQ. But even if he did switch to the Q, South should be able to work out to overtake. The ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: @SQ looks like quite an obvious singleton.|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might be vaguely thinking about scissors coup ideas - throwing dummy's spades on diamonds to stop the south entry|pg||
nt|daman: Sominex Coup    put the opps to sleep and make a false claim|pg||
nt|athene: but it's all just not possible|pg||
nt|daman: wjich they accept |pg||
nt|athene: for one thing even if he cashed the @DK declarer couldn't come to hand, and for another thing, south can win the last diamond anyway|pg||
nt|jcmax: How about this? Win @SA in hand, play a @D to K and a low @C off dummy. will south always hope with the A?|pg||
nt|athene: sorry i meant throwing spades, not clubs, on the diamonds :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: *hop|pg||
nt|athene: arghhh throwing clubs not spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: if it is penalties, and I see no reason why it shouldn't be |pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: its basically showing a strong defensive oriented hand but no way will west stand it|pg||

nt|ralfwil: if D on 2@h is showing @h, why not 3@h from E|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, that's just my opinion, and EW seem to disagree|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes low club off dummy is very cute|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: 3NT not such a bad shot|pg||
nt|royhughes:  3N is an interesting contract.  I think the normal 4H was going down with the clubs lying badly|pg||

nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 10-12 in this room first, followed by comparisons from the closed room when we roll over to board 1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Frances Hinden and Jeffrey Allerton are also a pair away from the table|pg||
nt|brolucius: Frances Hinden is rated one of the best female players in the country, but she took no part in the recent women's trials.|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: NS playing 15-17 and 4 card majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, Jeffrey replaced by Graham Osborne now|pg||
nt|daman: Nicola didn't play either|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: EW playing 15-17 NT, 5 card majors, transfer responses|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it appeared he made slam in no trumps|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe with a poor diamond suit and partner having shown a minimum opener Gunnar judged slam remote|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: east west under lots of pressure in diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is a bit of a perfecto after all|pg||
mb|2H|an|weak two|nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks in nt on EW?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: just the right cards hardly anything wasted etc|pg||

pc|h8|nt|daman: that card fit into North's cusp in @S|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|brolucius: Hinden: 'My @SQ should solidify partner's suit.'|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is a very unlucky situation for E/W|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes 4@H seems the normal spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N does not look like a superior contrat to 4H |pg||
nt|davidstern: The lead was spot on - not sure if it was indeed possible but avoids any possibility of a strip and endplay|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|daman: better cash the @H Ace|pg||
nt|daman: otherwise he will be squeezed for 12 tricks|pg||

nt|daman: unlikely|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

pc|d5|nt|lestergold: it was played of course by west|pg||
nt|davidstern: In the CR a diamond lead low from East Queen from South so |pg||
nt|davidstern: A diamond was ninth trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes diamond lead did it|pg||
nt|davidstern: Had north led a more 'normal' @D10 it would have also gone down|pg||

nt|royhughes:  Yes, it is important to know partner's tendencies|pg||
nt|royhughes:  This is a deal where EW certainly want to stay at the 1-level, which some pairs can't do because they open 2D or something special|pg||
nt|henryb:  and it is probably a good reason to lead 10 rather than fourth best from those holdings. I had never thought about it|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|r|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  go quietly or try for a minus some other way?|pg||

nt|henryb:  How many here play MUD?|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: agree|pg||
mb|1C|an|strong|mb|p|mb|1D|an| |nt|davidstern: In the OR on this hand West opened 1@C, South reopened with a double, West redoubled to show his fine hand and then E/W lay down and let the opps play a normal heart partscore|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|brolucius: At the week-end, on BBO, David Gold said that he hated the idea of playing four-card majors alongside the weak 1NT. I rather agree with him.|pg||

nt|davidstern: This wont be much fun but likely win 1 imp|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||

nt|brolucius: I'm sorry, my last comment was nonsense (as a few tactful kibitzers may have noticed). That is what happens when you play the strong 1NT and the 1NT rebid is therefore weak. ...|pg||
