nt|imp_jan: hi|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|othered1: It would be nice to have an ASTRO cue or the like (4 other major, 6@C) available for south hand, but few play it.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: with all cards open we can see that 3n goes down|pg||

nt|varange: same here. also east has just clearly announced ownership of stoppers|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer played last hand way too fast|pg||
nt|keylime:  agreed. very much an autopilot type fo approach|pg||
nt|rodal f: Specs by 50-50 now. Did Es hand grow after 3@S or not. Grew I will say|pg||
nt|hantveit: I will actually save it and calculate the odds for practice purposes|pg||
mb|1S|nt|janhamhurg: spades hearts here, who will win the bidding?|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|paulg:  a 5-card multi|pg||
mb|2N|nt|baldfriede: Will East show his majors?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lasseaa: with the singlejumps after 1 nt, you avoid shit three NT, but you loose control on slams|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzec: ouch|pg||
nt|keylime:  If the defense can start spades quickly, this is going down a bit|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: i'm at a loss to see how they arrived in 2@s|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Difficult to show both majors after the 1nt interference. So they found the Moysian only.|pg||
nt|varange: in the other room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same sequence but transfer, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: John Carruthers suggests 1@c-1@d-1NT-DBL|pg||
nt|rnmalik: possible|pg||
nt|paulg:  stength according to vulnerability ... so no doubt what it is|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hantveit: a very tough 2nt by north. 2 aces and 4 card support in dia is good, but is it good enought for a 2nt bid?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|janhamhurg: a little too much, again the vuln game bonus makes them bid a lot|pg||
nt|paulg:  Presuming that South could have bid 3@h to show a good raise, I think North has overdone it a little|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|janhamhurg: agree, the 2 spade call showed a decent hand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|varange: would 2@c by east show the majors?|pg||
nt|varange: intersting.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: if double shows at least 5/4 in the majors I am all for it, but else...|pg||
nt|hantveit: what would be your bid lasse and frank?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c2|pc|h7|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|janhamhurg: so 2 off, east west gaining even more imps here|pg||
nt|paulg:  bidding thin vulnerable games is fine if you only go down one, but costly when more|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and there was a small chance to be doubled- so that could have been expensiv|pg||
pc|dA|nt|baldfriede: None of the possible continuations of South are to his liking.|pg||
nt|keylime:  at the other table, the auction was a bit more sedate; E did not open 3@d but competed after the spade fit was known|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dK|nt|varange: 2@h initially looks to be OK, but has the slight blemish of not making, far as I can tell|pg||

nt|andyv:  did W really expect to have a play for 3N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: as we spoke about on hand 17 - they did bid 3nt, and the leas WAS low spade - so 3nt came home sweetly|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|varange: I gtg. See you all.|pg||
nt|keylime:  I think West played East for cards. With that square of hand, there would be no reason to really bid that way|pg||
nt|hantveit: the lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|baldfriede: N/s will likely end in 4@s here.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: @h splinter bid now?|pg||
nt|keylime:  Especially over a 1st seat NV vs. VUL preempt|pg||
nt|andyv:  even if E had th ideal hand, 8 tricks would be the max one could expect in NT with the W hand|pg||

nt|xenya: a trivial 3N|pg||
nt|paulg:  you see that they made 12 tricks in the other room and you think this will be a chance ... but then you see only Roland would bid it|pg||
nt|lasseaa: three rounds of spade = 10|pg||
nt|lasseaa: wrong|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: A push and next|pg||
pc|h6|nt|drewsky: West should return a club in case declarer has AKQ of @D...in order to remove the entry to dummy|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  safety play hand?|pg||
nt|keylime:  North will need to play for the drop to get home here; lacking the T-9, and having it be in both hands, he may be forced to the winning line.|pg||
nt|hantveit: a heart fit for ns here, and 5 losers + 6 losers indicates 24-11= 13 tricks. so the loser count is not working here|pg||

mb|3S!|nt|rodal f: If any would like to use BBO-TV: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
mb|4S|nt|drewsky: I think it also matters what minor the oppopnents open relative to your length in their minor as well|pg||
nt|po-s: 3H by West?|pg||
nt|Rafa: Winner here represents Norway in the European Champions Cup in November|pg||
nt|drewsky: At the other table, west opened north's 5 card minor, so a delayed takeout double of hearts was not to be considered|pg||
nt|jcmax: The cards lie very favourably for EW and exactly where you wwould expect them to be with this bidding. But does W have enough to drive to game?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 1 dia transfer|pg||

nt|andyv:  at least forcing:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: All by good cards here:) 2NT=inviting jacoby and 3@H good lift in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: I don't think so, after all partner only balanced|pg||
nt|jcmax: But maybe E feels he is not minimum?|pg||
nt|po-s: so does West hav a good enough hand?|pg||
nt|po-s: West could have just raised|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Indeed, 3@H is a serious raise|pg||
nt|drewsky: Certainly the west hand is worth more than a simple raise to 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lasseaa: If you a computer with Internet Trond, you can take a look on running scores at http://www.bk2000.org/live/Teams.aspx|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: If only you knew the layout here .....|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All viewers would obviously play spades for no loser|pg||
nt|paulg:  6@c looks pretty good here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|keylime:  those are avoidable losses|pg||
nt|nigel: Hi all:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Nigel and welcome. Nice to see u|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: hi nigel!|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 2@D is a weak Multi, 5 cards|pg||
nt|po-s: I´ll ask GIB|pg||
nt|keylime:  and, every imp counts, especially in a round robin format|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/norway/groetheim-tundal.pdf|pg||
nt|jcmax: what are you going to ask GIB PO?|pg||
nt|po-s: it must be a very weak Multi if this is enough to jump to game|pg||
nt|drewsky: Apparently the double was a game try in opener's major ?|pg||
nt|xenya: almost ideal -- all cards working|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: 3@Dx in OR|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@h is spades or a game forcing relay .. or in this case both|pg||
nt|nigel: Hi midle of summer and the rain never stops in Sydney|pg||
mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: perfekt fit, esp the dia position|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Nigel|pg||

nt|hantveit: 12+14 points should be an easy game to reach|pg||
mb|2D!|an|!H|nt|keylime:  maybe the beginnings of a Gazzill relay with the 2C rebid there|pg||
nt|keylime:  Gazzilli*|pg||

mb|2H|nt|jcmax: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2-10 it shows|pg||
nt|Walddk4: so he is about medium|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm surprised South did not bid diamonds on the first round|pg||
nt|keylime:  spelling, it counts as well. lol|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 3@c on N instead of 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A hand witch Roland would have loved by 20-20|pg||
mb|4H|nt|baldfriede: Coffee break hand.|pg||
nt|nigel: This seems like a normal action 4@s cold a nice sac in 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: 3 no doesnt make|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@D goes 3 down on a trump lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d seems to be the limit here|pg||
nt|keylime:  well they've right sided the contract if they are thinking of 6@d|pg||
nt|rodal f: Terje's possible senarios? Next board pleace:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lasseaa: he needs a boot|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: and so it did|pg||
nt|keylime:  but 5 does appears to be the last safe harbor here.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rnmalik: 11 tricks |pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, unless declarer rtries @s hook now|pg||
nt|andyv:  6 is for when you know you are down in the match|pg||
nt|hantveit: accordingly to loser count you should have 7-5=24-12=12 tricks, less one ace to litle=11 So might work this time..|pg||
pc|d7|nt|drewsky: How can one play the spades for no loser without peaking|pg||
nt|po-s: pretty much exactly|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No-one can Drew, that's why I said all *viewers*|pg||
nt|po-s: Easy Drew, king and then small to eight|pg||
nt|keylime:  and I think WE probably feel it's close and not gotten away from there|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 6 clubs coming nearer|pg||
nt|hantveit: difficult hand to play actually. You must find the line to defend yourself against heart split 4-1|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: do you understand the auction, Jan?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: wow, someone can|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to evaluate the E hand... the void in @s certainly is no help and he knows he has a @h loser|pg||
pc|cK|nt|keylime:  well, East gets a break here with the lead|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|po-s: if "one" is GIB or DF|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Grøtheim|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: great bidding!!:)|pg||
nt|xenya: anyway, very well done|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess Tundal has bid this thinking it is on a finesse at worst ... really well bid|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: have a look on the alerted bids, they are explained|pg||
nt|xenya: not on my screen|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 no shows 3-2-3-5 disrtibution|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 4 clubs 5 controls|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: Not sure what made him do that|pg||
nt|drewsky: but north will play the ten from holdings such as J10, 109, and J109|pg||
nt|andyv:  but how does he set up his tricks?....doesn't he have to ruff 2@s still?|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: now Davidsen is thinking|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think he will make it... almost need @ds to be 2-2|pg||
nt|keylime:  I'm thinking A-K of spades, and then crossruff|pg||
nt|keylime:  he doesn't know South has the 5@d stiff|pg||

nt|jcmax: the beginning of the set. you may try to do something different from the other table.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: The 3@C overcall might suggest that he has a singleton, but is that inference enough?|pg||

nt|hantveit: sp K and ruff a clubs, then heart K.|pg||

nt|po-s: perhaps he should have led a diamond....|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is not a Restricted Choice issue as some specs suggest, because the 10 can be played from various holdings as Drew pointed out|pg||
nt|keylime:  WE may now feel behind by 10-12 imps (1 game swing)|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think E pushed too hard over the 4@h bid... when W couldn't redbl to show a control, E should have given up the ship and just bid 5@d|pg||
nt|keylime:  I did not like the 5@c bid.|pg||

mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|keylime:  a rather normal 3NT coming here it appears|pg||
nt|hantveit: everyone should memorise the most common once. 5 card missing, 4 cards and 6 cards.|pg||
mb|p|nt|drewsky: I don't think that south's play at trick one should be count...I think it should be about whether south can stand a heart shift later in the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: this wont make---|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: That is when you play the obvious shift method. Not everyone does that, though. some people do play count :)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Just keep your cards closer to your chest|pg||

nt|drewsky: yes, Sabine..it semms like south might have taken some action..not north|pg||
nt|keylime:  Berset would be calm if he knew the Q of hearts was favorable|pg||

nt|jcmax: Can you show 2KC+Q +void? :)|pg||
nt|po-s: me too- 5S is enough|pg||
nt|drewsky: I beleive one should only show the void when partner knows was suit it is, or if it known to be a 'working' void|pg||

nt|keylime:  push board on board 8|pg||
nt|hantveit: will we get boards with a lot of possibilities, or will we get flat once...?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rnmalik: 690 vs 500, not good|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we say a coffeboard?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: This is another flatty, or 1 imper|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|Walddk4: 1@C is 16+, in theory|pg||
nt|po-s: no prblem at all - seven can´t be made though (I think)|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  yes, as you pointed out, the contract was right sided here....wrong sided in OR|pg||
nt|rodal f: A dam sprty 3@H:)|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|drewsky: Sabine, would you have overcalled 1@H ?|pg||
nt|jcmax: I must admit I would have bid something. wouldn't be able to resist with such nice distribution :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@S is 8-11, 4441 any single in an uncontested auction. It's probably different after interference|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: mr hogstadt just tells me, that Ringseth has won the under 28 Worldchampionship in 2008, so we see 4 good players here|pg||
nt|hantveit: The double will help dec playing|pg||
nt|hantveit: well. if 5D we get some action after all...|pg||
nt|hantveit: that will be 500|pg||
mb|4D|nt|drewsky: Seems to me that I would choose a call to show 2 suits|pg||
nt|rodal f: sporty|pg||
mb|4S|nt|nigel: Seems like total trick action 9 trumps  go for 9 tricks pre-emptive|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: on West???|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 9+ and a heart stopper after interference I am told|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Many thanks to our many helpful specs|pg||
nt|po-s: not on East, Drew|pg||
nt|ralfwil: made it difficult for EW to make a slam try |pg||
nt|rodal f: Still. The 6er are by bad odds|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and a @h lead was much more effective|pg||
nt|keylime:  Ekren will enjoy the club position|pg||
nt|rodal f: Else by normal good defence it's 1 for EW|pg||
nt|hantveit: west has told his story now. he invited partner to 5, and partner said no.|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: http://www.bk2000.org/live/Teams.aspx|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: I really hate it when partner is telling the same story twice...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|drewsky: I like to play crash, so I would double 1@C to show 2 suits of the same COLOR|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jcmax: The way Grøtheim has been playing he might even make this slam!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk4: They may survive slam even if @SK scores. No heart lead for instance|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N or 4@S here -- take your pick|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|lasseaa: and when you do?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|janhamhurg: may be 12 tricks after heart to the ace|pg||
pc|c8|nt|po-s: would 5H be the king and no intention of bidding slam myself?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but 10 only now|pg||
nt|xenya: he found the best lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcmax: Oh that is true, as a spec just pointed out Grøtheim didn't bid @S first .)|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW are 0 and 3 in NT games.... maybe they should take them out of their bid box!|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|po-s: I think perhaps South should have doubled 5H|pg||
nt|hantveit: the club shift made id more difficult to get 11. if more dia or sp, you could ruff dia, take out trumphs and play club club club|pg||
pc|c3|nt|nigel: Yep 6@s a lucky make the AJ@H wasted|pg||
nt|hantveit: but west needed to duck|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|baldfriede: This bidding sequence seems to indicate a bigger hand than an immediate 2@s bid.|pg||
nt|jcmax: For what reason PO?|pg||
nt|po-s: ah, he was on lead, forgot that|pg||
nt|jcmax: We all forgot .)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We did, those funny systems|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  this will make it 4 times they have gone down|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|po-s: ace|pg||
nt|jcmax: But even he hadn't been on lead. a lot of partnerships play a double like that as: DON'T lead a heart|pg||
nt|po-s: , no?|pg||
nt|drewsky: I still think it is right to double.....I have had opponents bid 6NT on me in these situations and I didn't ge the lead I wanted.|pg||
nt|drewsky: Yes, Sabine....many play double says dont lead it|pg||
nt|po-s: the non-doubles, do they come in by partners too - thought it was the bidder|pg||
nt|jcmax: very much so by the partner as well. Especially when he has raised the suit.|pg||
nt|drewsky: A good partnership has specific agreements about when the reverse doubles apply , and by each partner|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|hantveit: south should unblock club H on ace to have communication on club 10|pg||

nt|jcmax: have any particular interest in you leading your suit|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 imps to Nord -- somewhat unfair as 3N is superior to 4@S |pg||
nt|hantveit: I heart shift would make things harder. duck a club take next and new heart.|pg||
nt|hantveit: but very hard, even in MP|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|po-s: how did North know who had the HJ|pg||

nt|rodal f: Looks like a possible stop at 2NT if S fight|pg||
pc|s3|nt|drewsky: THAT is why we all have bridge notes, right Sabine ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 0-8 1@D is|pg||
nt|paulg:  something to be said for South overcalling 2NT initially on this auction|pg||
nt|paulg:  at least you find out where you stand ... although that may be doubled!|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@C shows clubs and a major?|pg||
nt|rodal f: And wrong I was|pg||
pc|s8|nt|keylime:  many p'ships play 4@c/@d over a 3M preempt as a two suited overcall showing the minor and other major|pg||
pc|s4|nt|paulg:  2@c is precision-like, 9-15 HCP|pg||
nt|paulg:  normally 6 clubs|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|andyv:  W has just enough defense to not take the push.... I'm not sure that I wouldn't have bid 4@s over 4@c with the W hand... the vul is right.|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: Berset comments on his clubsuit: nice hand in poker :)|pg||
nt|keylime:  I confess if the auction had gone 1@s (2@s) I would raise, and then think about it when South came back in with another bid|pg||
nt|hantveit: I agree with east. 9 points, J109 in spade, J10 in clubs. a lot of possibilities. so litle will made it make - bid 3nt|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hantveit: make it make|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jcmax: The reason I have bridge notes is that at my age I would forget otherwise.....|pg||
nt|rodal f: It was 14-16NT if I don't remember wrong. The power from E came from where?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk4: 1NT 17-19|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|jcmax: We like to lead an unbid major vs NT, but some theories say that leading from Axxx is not a good idea when there are reasonable alternatives.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I would have led @C3, but I am hopeless|pg||

mb|2N|nt|Walddk4: Transferring into his major with 4@D|pg||

nt|vugraphzec: :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: board 30 is a slam... very interesting end|pg||

nt|rodal f: vent|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is a case for a 4@H response, pass or correct, if you don't want to hear about their minors, but maybe that would have made East bid 4NT on the way out|pg||
nt|jcmax: it didn't at the other table, though|pg||
nt|po-s: But not if 4H is natural to play|pg||
nt|drewsky: Most play 4@H is NOT pass/correct|pg||

nt|rodal f: I realy hope ure at ure home Lasse:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|nigel: Although it is not a success, I like the passive heart lead rather than a low club. Different to defending against 3NT|pg||

pc|s7|nt|hantveit: Hi, how are you|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we say hi to Trond Hantveit:)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

nt|keylime:  and business is about to pick up here|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: Ringseth and Ekren are enjoying this :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  or 2N asked what type of raise|pg||
nt|hantveit: opps might turn to the opposite major|pg||
nt|hantveit: now he plays spade, and opps will turn to the other major.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Next board is the final one from 1st div Norway. A realy THX to Lars by ure well done vug work|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcmax: Anyway, with this particular S hand you could be pretty sure partner would work out what you are doing even if 4@H was not pass or correct :)|pg||

pc|s6|nt|rodal f: Then I will ask Trond and Lasse what they would have didded after 3@H?:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: bidded|pg||
nt|hantveit: I think 4 clubs is OK, but then I would pass 4nt. partner has told you several times now that he has a minimum hand|pg||
nt|hantveit: West has no reason to continue pushing, as there is not estatblished a fit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Non to give there meanings. My bid would have been 4@H by single Q nearly 100 by 100 times|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. Trong u came:)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|keylime:  yep. some may term it as a "3rd suit forcing" style of raise. Quite rare to have 2NT as natural in this sequence|pg||
nt|hantveit: that is my second option, the problem with that bid is that you might lose the club fit. 4 clubs is last chance for partner wo wake up.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rodal f: Trond|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Drew, tell us why Multi is still a naughty word in ACBL land|pg||
nt|drewsky: If my agreement was not pass/correct, then I would afraid of missing my 6-6 spade fit if I bid 4@H|pg||
nt|rodal f: But the best to THX each time is the specs by the nice inputs  -   making ut not go at sleep. THX SPECS|pg||
nt|hantveit: it is 52,4% that the spade T will drop. But dos not help here when it dos not|pg||

nt|po-s: the double might not have promised a sui, just lead directing|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hantveit: That depends on what you have agreed. If they play first find best game, then look for slam, 3spade is just asking for spade stopper.|pg||

nt|jbgood: 6 @d is better than 6@h, but 6 NT even better|pg||
nt|othered1: Can they firmly determine whether west has first or second round @C control?|pg||
nt|jbgood: only by asking verbally, I think:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: it would be something like "har du esset eller kongen, makker?"|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't know their methods, but with many once you're past the usual ace-asking bid, you must find a way indirectly, if at all.|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|othered1: Maybe in a natural method, east could try 5@S hoping for a 6@C re-cuebid|pg||
