nt|athene: 4@S wouldn't have been fun for NS - west was just waiting to get his hands on that one|pg||
nt|ciaran: Hi all|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Ciaran|pg||
nt|petergill: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: welcome to all|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: this is the 3 segment of the 3 round quarter finals|pg||
nt|petergill: This is the last 12 boards of a 36 board quarter-final in New Delhi, India|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Ruzbeh|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: hi|pg||
nt|petergill: A quiet heart partscore to start, perhaps|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Geoffrey and all|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: hi and welcome to all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: its close after the first 16|pg||
nt|roswolf: very looks like a good match|pg||
nt|roswolf: a partscore to start|pg||
nt|loganrun: 3NT needs to be played by North to have a chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: Lets see if NS help/push EW to slam?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|james_h: Tom Hanlon takes matters into his own hands|pg||
nt|james_h: Given this start,I think south will definately sac in 6@s ... lets see|pg||
nt|mcarroll: How many @S from Hugh? 4 I guess|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and now we will compare the scores|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: that last board may well produce a swing - as even 3@s on spot on defenc cant make|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: welcome to all|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know the systems?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|roswolf: fireworks from the formidables is to be expected|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: welcome to all|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: Hamman in his book castigated the jack-denies lead method. |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..and hi William|pg||
nt|roswolf: 51 imps behind with 16 bds to go is a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: 3@D = transfer|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|xenya: still, with a little bit of luck...|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ciaran: Hi Martin|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Reckoned it gave declarer more help than it was worth |pg||
nt|chick: how high will NS go in @Ds?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: As ever with these thngs, the truth is somewhere near the middle|pg||
nt|chick: looks like 4 is the limit|pg||
nt|frankaus: this action quite a contrast to th OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: PC technical problem with the CR NIBU NI match|pg||
nt|mdgraham: an enterprising 1@S overcall |pg||
nt|loganrun: South did better here than in the closed room|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sunsamvar: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: And James is right if EW bid 6 they will find the save|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one will take some work|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi David|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: look fairly standard from what I saw last set|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like a prepared 1@D and a preemptive raise|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1 pair played multi 2@D the other normal weak 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: normal enough to reach 4major when you have a 5-4 fit and some shape|pg||
nt|andyv:  and some help which the @c lead does provide|pg||
nt|athene: but south's values aren't exactly where north wants them|pg||
nt|petergill: Welcome to my co-commentator Frank Budai|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty gary|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 3NT here would be my choice aswell|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|petergill: South would balance with a Dbl if he was in the pass-out (last to speak, or balancing) position. |pg||
nt|roswolf: now if this makes.|pg||
nt|xenya: this appears to be makeable|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: duck a diamond|pg||
nt|james_h: whos buying?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  defence can well start with taking first 5 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't believe that this is the auction|pg||
nt|cuttysark: good afternoon|pg||
nt|ady: hi     late start|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup and the comeback would begin|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ciaran: Looks like an easy 4S or a thin 6S here which will fail due to both trump honours being offside|pg||
nt|xenya: losing a trump and two clubs|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|frankaus: 10 quickly|pg||
nt|loganrun: although 3S rather than 4H would win the hand - still not off yet|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mcarroll: OK - me|pg||
nt|james_h: Martin is a great team player|pg||
nt|athene: east had better jump in with the @DA and switch to a spad|pg||
nt|athene: spade|pg||
nt|andyv:  difficult hand to declare... when N goes after @ds, the @s switch will be obvious|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: good double - wrong ace for a maximum penalty godd still going down|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not yet though|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  been pushed too high    cant make 4 if diamonds attacjed early|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  but E seems to be unaware of the danger to the hand|pg||
nt|athene: well it's very hard for east - he doesn't know anything about declarer's hand|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: needed to win diamond ace first time really..|pg||
nt|andyv:  but he does know he has no tricks in @ds and @cs... @s suit is only hope|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think winning A of @d was all that difficult|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone and welcome to New Delhi|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry for the 1 hour delay|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: miskeyed.....will catch up at claiming|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Sunit|pg||
nt|sunit: hi all|pg||
nt|petergill: Trump lead gives declarer some work to do|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: mind you now I look they were different pairs :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: attacked|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|hK|nt|xenya: declarer should simply set up clubs|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|rodal f: Hi James, Martin and specs I'm Frank from hot Norway. Just -23C now:)|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks to be -1 from here|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|roswolf: well declarer is favorite|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|figo: last deal was potentially a very good outcome for DSM|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|petergill: Yes, the trump leads are very good defence. |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5@C wasn't making either, but it is normal to take out insurance on hands like these|pg||
nt|roswolf: btw do we know the systems|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: with the added advantage that the defence may not take the queen|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Frank|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Sinil     Liz|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm afraid i don't|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: 3@H was aggressive and may have led to a game raise - south knows his customer!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ciaran: when the wind is in your sails, these contracts make - a little unlucky for Hamilton and Ferguson|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A bit unfortunate - the bidding looks reasonable, unlucky to find the trumps stacked. So first imps to CBAIlookk|pg||
pc|dK|nt|frankaus: 11 now & may take @H fin for 12|pg||
nt|chick: wish I knew what 3@H meant .. might be a clue to whether to finesse @Hs or not|pg||
nt|mdgraham: high card raise to 3@S, I suspect|pg||
pc|d8|nt|james_h: North needs to establish @d because he cant draw t and ruff, 3@c and 1@h|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: best of fortune re exams..|pg||
nt|athene: even if you know that declarer has a singleton diamond, it might sometimes be right to duck - give declarer @SAxx for instance|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
nt|athene: now rising the ace gives him pitches for both spades but if you duck he loses no diamond but two spades|pg||
nt|athene: but i agree it might have ben findable if east remembers his side needs FOUR tricks to beat this|pg||
nt|andyv:  as long as this isn't match points, rising with A of @d and switching to K of @s was called for. |pg||
nt|petergill: If the defence never touched trumps, declarer could probably hold his losses to only his five top losers|pg||
nt|xenya: but we can work it out i think -- in general|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|frankaus: Value raise of @S would be my guess|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s6|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chick: could it show something in hearts besides?|pg||
nt|frankaus: even 13 now on @H finn|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H a make n/s   but would not be allowed to play there|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c2|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  N guessed right... he could have saved himself a headache by not cashing the Ace of @cs first|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|s7|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|frankaus: @C ruff is always likely tho|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chick: safely making contract is always good |pg||

pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||

nt|mcarroll: After 3 frantic boards - a little placidity?|pg||
nt|andyv:  in the open room, N made 5@h|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: NS rather got away with that I'm afraid..|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for standings, convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|mcarroll: well played to flatten the board|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: director has been called for settling a dispute|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: dispute resolved - scores remain the same|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   can make 4@H    may have difficulty getting there|pg||
nt|petergill: The defence at the other table correclty led trumps, but they switched away from trumps too early. |pg||
nt|roswolf: looks a solid start for n/s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here's a 4@S for them|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: a heart barrage might occur|pg||
nt|roswolf: ns strong club ew 2/1 i am told|pg||
nt|roswolf: 12 imps to the trailing team|pg||
nt|xenya: so 12 imps on the 1st board -- a promising start for the trailing team|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup :)|pg||
nt|figo: will sumit open 1S here ?|pg||
nt|figo: some hold up ?|pg||
nt|loganrun: wd North but the defence erred|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: allowing declarer to ruff the club high |pg||
mb|1H|nt|chick: this bid won't make N's day any happier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tell us about the players Sunit, please|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S husband and wife as far as I recall|pg||
mb|1S|nt|james_h: McGann dows not like passing |pg||
nt|sunit: sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I could be wrong |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hI liz|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont like south's doubl|pg||
nt|roswolf: could receive a bloody nose|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Ok. I can leave so they come back:)|pg||
nt|sunit: rajeev and himani are a husband- wife pair from Mumbai|pg||
nt|ady: north take-out double has given them a chance|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Yes 4@H is a great contract|pg||
mb|2C|an| |nt|frankaus: X or 1nt here  - 1NT 4 me|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a very strong weak raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: S need to run |pg||
nt|andyv:  sometimes the obvious escapes us at the table|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like 2S is the last making contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: bd 117 was 1 imp to n/s 3@D -2 in the other room|pg||
mb|3S|nt|james_h: but bidding 2@d here is a poor IMPS bid|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I might have made a horrible takeout double with the South hand because of the 4-4 majors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'd prefer 2@C with the fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree unless playing 2/1|pg||
nt|xenya: what would you suggest, Jeoffrey?|pg||
nt|roswolf: axe|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: Hang on a min Rodal :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sunit: I am not sure which Banerjee is this but must be from the railway team|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Too much, four obvious losers|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: still S there now for him|pg||
nt|roswolf: pass actually|pg||
nt|xenya: over 3@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: we'll give you 2 more hands|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|roswolf: if pard cant act then game unlikely|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, when fixed stay fixed|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: I am surprised that S in Open did not bid|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H by north conservative|pg||
nt|petergill: South is disciplined enough to stop bidding, despite 19 HCP|pg||
nt|petergill: downgrading KQ doubleton, Frank? |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: solid game no dangers visible|pg||
nt|xenya: this might be bloody indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: that lead for the max i think|pg||
nt|figo: action time !|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east liked the hidden diamond fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  now this one really does require a lot of work|pg||
nt|ady: by South   sorry|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if vul they may hav pushed on to game|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems a little conservative to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: trying for a club ruff seems best|pg||
nt|loganrun: West might have bid 4S at his second turn - if 2C is naturalish - his hand has improved - now this has happened|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: thats the link for the scores|pg||
pc|dK|nt|davidstern: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: yes this banerjee is from railways.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sunit: only way to beat this contract is after cashing both the clubs north has to play a heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, this may make now|pg||
nt|sunit: difficult though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Too late|pg||
nt|xenya: on best defence that is|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sfoxa:  in modern bidding, strong dbl on 1N is out of date |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|athene: you can be a lot more aggressive with hands like east's if you know it's a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  3 chances to make... slim, fat and none|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he expected 2@H to guarantee a 4th trump|pg||
nt|frankaus: yes the whole hand needs to be downgraged imo|pg||
pc|c9|nt|davidstern: This will make if declarer is careful in the trump suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Needed a heart lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kiwibridge: yes good try next please :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup |pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|andyv:  some use 2N (this time it would be by E) to find out what quality of raise partner gave them... it would have helped this time|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes E has assumed 4 hearts, and I think at least 3 diamonds and added a bit more as well|pg||
nt|athene: north has quite a lot of defensive cards not to double this|pg||
nt|athene: but his partner is a passed hand and he doesn't have any distributional surprises|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, E was a bit optomistic....2@h was already too high|pg||
nt|athene: and no-one forced east to bid game!|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 8 tricks only and no real pressure on E/W - i cant see a 9th ?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ciaran: the defense can get a cross ruff going here for -3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes in first position, but a balancing dbl over 2@H is very much in vogue|pg||
nt|davidstern: Still may be OK if he runs a heart from dummy|pg||
nt|sunit: no can still beat|pg||
nt|loganrun: Tough for South but it doesn't matter|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sunit: with a heart switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|roswolf: defence dropping tricks i think|pg||
nt|figo: guess rajiv will be disppointed by the C suit in dummy|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: well, whether South runs or not depends on your parameters for doubling 1NT   |pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South can be endplayed to lead away from @DK|pg||
nt|sunit: why?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Though I suppose if the heart finesse was wrong 4@H might not make|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: whereas west cards were in spades where he thought they werent|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mcarroll: Me neither|pg||
nt|sunit: no he can exit a trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what trump? I cash all my trumps but one|pg||
nt|sunit: no endplay here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What are you going to throw on the spades?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: Good club lead - this looks like 200 to NS|pg||
pc|d8|nt|frankaus: with a flattish 1 count u know this is not a gr8 spot|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mcarroll: Unless the defence slip|pg||
nt|davidstern: The defence have now put this at risk by forcing declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'll watch your discards and endplay you|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: oh no|pg||
nt|xenya: @D return was vital|pg||
nt|roswolf: surely the lead was a singleton?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: coup en passant now|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|james_h: 1imp pick up here|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: agreed, if you are certain partner cannot hold (for example) AKQJ sixth  plus an ace |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now has to ruff as @H pitched|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d5|nt|ciaran: Surprisingly, north didn't overcall at the other table|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|andyv:  this auction needs to go back to the drawing board|pg||
nt|figo: he is praying for H finesse but alas|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: rapid play......missed tricks...claiming at the end|pg||
nt|figo: ok|pg||
pc|s8|nt|james_h: sry, 0 imps|pg||

nt|loganrun: West must take a lot of the blame for this|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: yes.....some discussion going on betw. E-W|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Certainly looks like it|pg||
nt|james_h: yes, but its a routing slam Rodal :) so your on your last legs here :)|pg||
nt|figo: welcome to this finals|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: double? :)|pg||
nt|james_h: routine|pg||
nt|andyv:  could be a battle of the minors here|pg||
nt|sunit: i agree, roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|xenya: it looked like -4 or so at the beginning|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: 6@S   excellent e/w     must avoid playing in 4-4 heart fit in the slam zone|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@D, 6NT and 6@S are all interesting possible contracts on this hand|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: west butts in|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes should have been - defence were too hasty|pg||
nt|loganrun: 3NT - vul is about a 50/50 shot here and better when North opens as he did - a chance for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: 2@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  1N=12-14?|pg||
nt|ciaran: E/W need to be careful here again - W will be thinking slam now, but E has the wrong values for him|pg||
nt|roswolf: west might regret this|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rodal f: U have counted the months?:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Nice @S fit|pg||
nt|sunit: Delhi, The Crown plaza hotel is the venue|pg||
nt|roswolf: i can understand easts double at the score|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: 1@C either 11-13 balanced or strong|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this is a good lead it seems|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  5 tricks in NT |pg||
nt|petergill: West passed his 12 count, donwngrading the singleton queen|pg||
nt|frankaus: KR values it at 17.25-  http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=kq+aq96+qj8+aj75|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: 2@c shows strong,without fit (in std carrot)|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: west hand is a problem hand for the weak nters as you can (and they have) missed their spade fit.  With such decent @s's i'd have opened 1@s|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 7@S makes..|pg||
nt|roswolf: north should take some action|pg||
nt|roswolf: south should go quietly|pg||
nt|xenya: considering 2@H?|pg||
nt|figo: NS are real life partners as well |pg||
nt|figo: simple bidding to start off|pg||
nt|loganrun: South can see the diamond suit as a source of tricks and should bid 4C as happened in the closed room |pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: on repeated trump leads this can fail|pg||
nt|ady: playing 6@S  a decent score|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C inverted minor raise|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, not inverted minor, 1@C must be Strong Club|pg||
nt|roswolf: must be|pg||
nt|loganrun: South must now save|pg||
pc|c4|nt|james_h: I dont believe South has shown his clubs naturally, he may have implied them|pg||
nt|rodal f: Should be implied now so 4@C to come?|pg||
nt|james_h: the fact the 3h is not alerted makes me think its just natural|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: looks as if they might pefewr the 4-4 fit... unfortunately|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C would be 5+ clubs, 8+ points, I think|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@D should make|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: thats the link for the scores|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 trumps, a club and a @H and @H ruff to lose |pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks straightforward to play|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzgh: Late alert of 3H|pg||
nt|ciaran: Well bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@H looks like an overbid |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D and 2@S natural|pg||
nt|petergill: EW in game-forcing auction |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|james_h: ok, south must have shown clubs |pg||
nt|po-s: he has shown clubs when he doesn´t rebid NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: the 4@D cue does not improve the E hand so they quit in time|pg||
nt|davidstern: Combined 24 cound stopped well short |pg||
nt|sunit: can be beaten by 2 tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT Pass 3@D should excite East|pg||
nt|figo: sry , disconnection |pg||
nt|figo: team many hands here did not opt for commonwealth trials and hence DSM will reprsent India |pg||
nt|figo: so that extra edge to the finals will be missing|pg||
nt|figo: of course there are 2 berths for India , host country and kejriwal team will be the other team |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W must be happy with this lead, not @d|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: Hei Peo|pg||
nt|james_h: I think McG will drive this bus home now in the snow|pg||
nt|vinbtech: and a 9 card minor fit to boot as well|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el is the tourney website|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|andyv:  lacking the spot cards, 4th best (or low for some) is the best lead with the W cards in @ds|pg||
nt|athene: will declarer try to steal a spade to make?|pg||
nt|vinbtech: though 3n is far from easy; a tempo behind imo|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: well at  least they will get a plus score     might even turn out to be a good score for e/w if in CR they get overboard in a heart slam|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D shows 4@S 3@D 5@C and thus only one @h opposite Axxx = perfect, so heading for 6@D or even (unlikely) 7@D |pg||
nt|roswolf: south is right to duck on genral principles|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: Nice to see that Mike Lawrence has so many fans in India. They even named a club after him as you see on the scoreboard|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk5: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D sets @D as trumps, 4@S cue bid of ace or king or both|pg||
nt|roswolf: but not here|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: true David|pg||
pc|dT|nt|roswolf: why nt play trumps|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sunit: now only 1 down|pg||
nt|xenya: i thought W would pass, then bid 2@S if needed|pg||
nt|petergill: Not looking for 7@D, as West is a passed hand, and "8 trumps" is not enough for 7@D to be a good % chance|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mcarroll: This bus has snow chains James?|pg||
nt|andyv:  is it stealing?|pg||
nt|athene: actually no need to steal, especially - opps don't have anything to cash|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: bingo David|pg||
nt|ady: down 1 in 6@H in CR|pg||
pc|d9|nt|frankaus: this will require some work - lets c if Namit brings it in|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|sunit: wow|pg||

nt|james_h: sorry Rodal, this it too tame for me|pg||
nt|james_h: I demand more "fast lane" hands|pg||
nt|mcarroll: but this time the @S save is too expensive|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And might even aggravate the opps into the grand|pg||
nt|po-s: spade save is 2000 I think|pg||
nt|po-s: and 7clubs more|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1700 might enough|pg||
nt|james_h: West is considering her options|pg||
nt|po-s: right, I counted 6 spade tricks, forgot the ruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  no reason for W to fly with the Ace|pg||
nt|athene: if his partner has the @HA there's no rush anyway|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, should have hoped for a missguess it seems..|pg||
nt|davidstern: Easy 4@S here|pg||
nt|davidstern: But need to get there |pg||
nt|ady: around a 20 imps swing on the heart split   mind you 6@H is not a great contract    needs decent trump split  plus spade finesse|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice 4@S for N/S if they get there|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another game for NS|pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid at both tables|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S seems to be biddable|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w might overstretch here|pg||
nt|figo: NS to play standard with lot of gadgets |pg||
nt|figo: EW also playing standard |pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk5: How are you going to bid a grand slam with any accuracy when opps bid spades like mad as happened in the other matches?|pg||
nt|james_h: opening 1@c with this hand when looking at the NS (terrifying animals :) ) may not be appealing|pg||
nt|po-s: is 2C clubs or strong?|pg||
nt|figo: 4S for NS ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: Very favourable layout here for E/W - @SQJ doubleton, @DQ9 onside, @C 3-3, @HJ right|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not a classical weak 2, but I know a lot of players who would open 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: By exlution blackwood EW should have a easy line til 7|pg||
nt|andyv:  OR somehow found and made 3@c here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the north hand wd probably have been opened in 3rd or 1st position|pg||
nt|frankaus: cansino suggests pass|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a doddle :)|pg||
nt|xenya: reaching 3N looks obvious|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: E worth an invite with two Axxx suits opposite a 15-17 NT, |pg||
nt|ady: 4@S can be beaten if clubs played before declarer can establish diamonds|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: thats with A@H right |pg||
nt|roswolf: might not make of course|pg||
pc|s2|nt|james_h: its an underbid but she gets a chance to rev theing up now|pg||
nt|james_h: things|pg||
nt|po-s: I doubt that|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A bit surprising S did not show both Majors?|pg||
nt|james_h: lets see|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but unlikely as @Hq is a stand out lead|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rodal f: P??|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Is 2@C really a limited opening? I mean, after all she has a 3 loser hand. Impossible to catch up later I predict. I agree with PO|pg||
nt|james_h: Ciara(West) in crying|pg||
nt|po-s: now South|pg||
nt|james_h: I'm sure|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 21 points and the opps have ignored you ... and found a fit ... |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good sign for finding fit with partner - N must be short in @h|pg||
nt|ady: still west can go up with the ace and switch to a club|pg||
nt|loganrun: Same contract - first to 7 wins|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good Pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  10 tricks will fall on S's lap|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone here like not leading pd's suit?|pg||
nt|athene: it's sensible to not lead partner's suit if you have one of your own|pg||
nt|athene: but eschewing the spade lead with a doubleton, just for KQx, seems a bit weird|pg||
nt|andyv:  i agree|pg||
pc|sA|nt|frankaus: @H and this may suceed|pg||
nt|james_h: South must smell a rat as he likes to balance|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  game in @c looks attractive|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: only fit left is @C's  - I like A 2NT gets the values across and N is marked with a few @s's on the auction|pg||
nt|figo: ah ha|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chick: E has an interesting problem here .... N didn't choose NT without a good stopper in @Hs|pg||
nt|chick: so is one of his black suits better chance to set?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's a lead declarer didn't want to see  |pg||
nt|james_h: this is an EW implosion|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes they dont have the theoretical points required, but maybe they will take the view that 3NT may be as likely as 2?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Will probably stop in 2N and be thankful to make|pg||
nt|xenya: courageous bid, 4@S |pg||
pc|s4|nt|wilkinsona: may concern declarer though..|pg||
nt|andyv:  rule of 6 should have told declarer not to hold up|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Nonvulnerable game - not usually right to stretch|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: even more unlikely into the aq10 :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm told 2@S could be a 3 card raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: a tip i think is good when you have to make up a large deficit is either to upgrade or downgrade your values on every hand so as to engineer a swing|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, spade now gives south some losing options...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Panja|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Panja|pg||
nt|nerio24: hi|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks made in closed room   playing in 3 spades|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: not sure of the EW system here....2@D either a straightforward Multi (so to speak) or possibly a bad-suit weak two|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If they do play clubs East must win the first diamond - West has to duck his king...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: I am told that Mike Lawrence has a carryover of 2 IMPs, not included on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|panja: so a Club ruff is the fourth trick for the defence?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  idee fixe|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S plays 4NT in Open|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't see any problems here|pg||
nt|roswolf: following that principle i might have treated it as a 20 hcp hand and say open 2nt|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 2@D=5-7, 5+cards|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  red lead brings 8th trick, what about 9th?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: not sure about the 3@h bid seems a bit much - then again 3@s looks like a make and opposite @sHx even with the known 4+ @s with east woukd have good chances|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nasty break|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: sorry, 0-7 hcp|pg||
nt|ady: I dont think unlikely Sunil  with tht diamond suit there to provide discards|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h7|nt|athene: when you try a speculative lead and declarer ducks, you always hope you found a good thing|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S really doesn't want to lead any suit|pg||
nt|ciaran: What was Hamilton's 2D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: Some alerts have not been entered in this auction|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|davidstern: Can certainly understand this auction - north unfoirtunately has a very good 2@S bid and east has a small amount of interest only|pg||
pc|c8|nt|roswolf: manageable perhaps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: trump now S|pg||
pc|c5|nt|xenya: yes, a passive defence should do the job|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|po-s: Probably there was a West face when Pass came back|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Well, the crux of the matter is that the West hand is too good for 2@C|pg||
nt|james_h: lol PO|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder why W is so reluctant to lead pd's suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Difficult decsion whether to ruff high or not|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in  |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3@S discard @C|pg||
pc|d4|nt|panja: @C8 does not tell anything to East|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el|pg||
nt|xenya: the fact that declarer didn't try to cash the @CK indicates he has another club|pg||
pc|d9|nt|panja: good point|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be some overtricks here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|wilkinsona: well, E seemed to encourage, and if so maybe wrong..|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: If the @C's broke 2/2 and hugh was able to sneak the @c9 into dummy this would make as it is hes blocked|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@C is 5 card Stayman so 2@D denies|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|athene: in which case there's far less long-term future in spades|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: possible end play here - W is probably going to discard 3@h and now @ha and another should produce 2@d tricks|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in 4@S probably ruff high|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: using the entry to finesse @D and play for split @d honours it looks like|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: west is sure the missing spades are 5-4, rather than 6-3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2 more rounds of @c would have been better |pg||

pc|hK|nt|sfoxa:  next door S managed to take 9 tricks|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: hi Roland, Nick and all|pg||
nt|roswolf: a splinter|pg||
nt|roswolf: north may make a try|pg||
mb|d|an| |nt|ciaran: Another hand where a spade slam may be investigated, but they need to stop at 4S|pg||

nt|roswolf: 3@H A 2way shot|pg||
nt|roswolf: east must pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@D looks like spades + another|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am told dont - D + higher|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  seems like a reasonable slam... not sure why it would go down|pg||
nt|athene: how do you fail in 6@H?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: viewgraph probably represented the true state of affairs there...|pg||
nt|andyv:  trumps are 2-2 and only need to ruff 2@cs in dummy|pg||
nt|panja: 4@H should be cold..but on wrong @C guess 3N will be in jeopardy|pg||

mb|p!|nt|ady: double conventional    capp perhaps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: still makes I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I imagine E tried to ruff a @d low|pg||
nt|loganrun: I was asked why it is poor - spades 2-2 is 37.5% and less with this preemption - plus there could be a heart ruff in 6S|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: yes declarer set off ruffing clubs but very carelessly ruffed a diamond with the @H2|pg||
nt|athene: there was a hand in a set earlier this morning where declarer had something like @S63 in dummy and ruffing with the @S6 stopped an overruff|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4 hearts was a sign off but west moves on..|pg||
nt|athene: west is always bidding slam with that hand after 1@H|pg||

nt|Walddk4: This tournament at the Crowne Plaza in New Delhi is in honour of Mr Mohan Lal Bhartia, an industrialist who loved playing rubber bridge and promoting bridge. Two teams from this ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: event qualify to play in the Commonwealth Bridge Championships held near the Commonwaelth Games in New Delhi in late October 2010|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe but may also be a swing tactic|pg||

nt|ciaran: Well done|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: single suitor i think.. woolsey|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: ahhh|pg||

nt|petergill: 6@H needs @D 3-3 and @SA onside, so 4@H is where you want to be|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|panja: 100% in Match points|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: perhaps there was a misunderstanding about the nature of 6@H here|pg||
nt|athene: east thought 5NT was asking for specific kings so 6@H denied one|pg||
nt|athene: and west thought 6@H showed two side kings|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting push board|pg||
nt|athene: if that isn't the case, west was just illogical - why not bid 7@H over 5?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: thats quite a raise by east on a 5 count but the clues are there - pd at least 6/4 opps bidding @D pd short .. good bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: also good judgment!!!|pg||

mb|2H|an| |nt|chick: thanks Christine|pg||

nt|davidstern: Are EW playing strong club?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Or has he simply avoided a reverse rebid|pg||
nt|vinbtech: y precision i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S is the best shot and defence need to be accurate i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  with 19hcp, S is not going away|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Trivial 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Standard, EW play Strong Club|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi:)|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Panja|pg||
mb|2S|an|relay|nt|mcarroll: The Open Room must have crashed, so we are not getting comparisons, but they bid and made 4@S on this board|pg||
nt|ciaran: 2H is a good result for N/S since it looks like E/W will make 2S, though it might be hard to get into the auction|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3@S asking for a @S stop|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  who will play this board will be disappointed heavily - all possible honours are off side|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have the balance      5-3 fit in hearts   but part score only|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  including 4-0 @d break|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: On the spade lead S will be very happy until trick 3|pg||
nt|roswolf: but e/w fall into the trap|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: should have down valued J@C and opened 1N imo|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@S is the best they can do at this point i guess|pg||
nt|frankaus: NS lead by 20 imps before this set|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||
nt|roswolf: but hope for declarer!?|pg||
nt|roswolf: constructive raise i suppose|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks good for the leaders|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ciaran: 2C from N forces 2D from S, and 2H is then to play|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: again they decide not to push for the nonvul game|pg||
nt|ady: nice stop by e/w   via leb 2NT|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @D to Q |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: missing pass over 3@S by North |pg||
nt|mdgraham: this can make - needs East to guess trumps|pg||
nt|andyv:  won't get there|pg||
nt|athene: but they can't get there|pg||
nt|andyv:  W can't move|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east should have bid 2@D then redoubled that, to show 44 majors|pg||
nt|vinbtech: 4H should prevail |pg||
nt|ady: should be down now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a lead teaser he now has 8|pg||
nt|panja: 2S down one..will be two IMPs for NS?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: running to 2@H like this sounds like 5 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: e thinking|pg||
nt|petergill: As South denied 4 spades (else South would rebid 1@S), 2@S is a safe rebid, cannot be raised to 4@S|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: thanks operator|pg||
nt|ciaran: May not have been E thinking - they are playing with screens|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  the Italian teams of the 60s made a fortune by not opening 1N with 4-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|athene: alternatively east could redouble|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he wanted to declare himself - didn't want the lead coming through all his tenaces|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: There was some ask for clarification of NS auction|pg||
nt|ciaran: Brave double from Hamilton should pick up 6 IMPs|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: hugh will be thinking what did i do to deserve that .. lovely contract nice lead ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: 9|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kiwibridge: 9 now lol|pg||

nt|petergill: No problems in 3NT. 4@H also is cold|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ciaran: Thanks Christine|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: They have yo write it down so slower than |pg||
pc|h2|nt|vinbtech: w/ E showing minors and 2H, the S9 should provide the 10th trick|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kiwibridge: he'll be smiling|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will lead 4th highest next time!?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now a sneaky @S6 |pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: The cold is affecting me!|pg||
nt|athene: but EW could still organise it so that they scramble to 2@S by east|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|athene: for example let's say east bids 2@D then redoubles|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: and now west wants to play 2@S but from the other side|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: What about conceding two diamonds and claim?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spades are irrelevant|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: sso *he* bids 2@H and then redoubles that!|pg||
nt|vinbtech: y thats right|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: cant really see how to make  going up with A@C  does not solve anything either|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C is on, but is not a great contract, needs no @H ruff, clubs to break and (if played by South) @SK onside|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I hope so!  worked for Chas Goren, usually right for me|pg||
nt|roswolf: ?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  I don't know if EW have that sophisticated of a partnership|pg||
nt|athene: this also has the advantage that partner has to suffer :) and you can go off and find a danish pastry and coffee  vendor|pg||

nt|james_h: This is a battle between a 2 wal club NS and a 1 way club EW|pg||
nt|james_h: way|pg||
nt|andyv:  if EW are playing precision, dbl of 2S should have shown max for the bidding but hardly inviting E to keep bidding|pg||
nt|mcarroll: a good Pass fro W|pg||
nt|andyv:  who invited W?|pg||
nt|andyv:  S better pull!|pg||

nt|andyv:  and N is a sadist to allow S to sit for the rdbl|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|james_h: Nice work by NS here, 2NT a good raise, 3d a trial bid (I expect)|pg||
nt|dslee: but I guess, here too, he should show that he has a 9 card major holding|pg||
nt|vicky888: 4 down?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: well, if East leads back a heart....question is, could the lead be from KJ10|pg||
nt|frankaus: will they find the killing defence?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: not sure why south didn't jump on 5@C|pg||
nt|panja: shd have led a trump..|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vbman: 1h is make or 1 down but they want to stay awake|pg||
nt|vicky888: that rdbl was sos??|pg||

nt|andyv:  don't know why W redbld... have to trust pd sometime|pg||

pc|s5|nt|chick: I count 5 clubs, 4 diamonds, and a spade.  next :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  exciting hand... somehow the feeling is N could have done better|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vbman: he hadto bid a game somewhere and let partner try to make it|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|loganrun: East - imho opinion has made the bid on his second chance rather than his first (1NT)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|vicky888: much of give and take of IMPs does really happen during bidding... its like plz take some IMPs!! No, No... i dont need that many IMPs, lets settle for fewer... kidding :)|pg||

pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: east would have been better-off to bid a weak jump shift 3@H over 1@S|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d9|nt|sfoxa:  as usually, in CR we started with 2 last boards|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mcarroll: Second borderline 4@S in a row for Hanlon Mcgann - just the type of situation in which they thrive|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like -1|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: maybe that wasn't available for him|pg||
nt|panja: two down now..|pg||
nt|panja: it is better to play in the long suit of the weaker hand..as this hand demonstrates|pg||
nt|po-s: strange way of playing - seems to never provide more than 7 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: nice trump switch by E -- N still could make it but took a wrong line|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s8|nt|panja: y|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
