nt|athene: 4@S wouldn't have been fun for NS - west was just waiting to get his hands on that one|pg||
nt|ciaran: Hi all|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Ciaran|pg||
nt|petergill: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: welcome to all|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: this is the 3 segment of the 3 round quarter finals|pg||
nt|petergill: This is the last 12 boards of a 36 board quarter-final in New Delhi, India|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Ruzbeh|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: hi|pg||
nt|petergill: A quiet heart partscore to start, perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: Lets see if NS help/push EW to slam?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|james_h: Tom Hanlon takes matters into his own hands|pg||
nt|james_h: Given this start,I think south will definately sac in 6@s ... lets see|pg||
nt|mcarroll: How many @S from Hugh? 4 I guess|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and now we will compare the scores|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: that last board may well produce a swing - as even 3@s on spot on defenc cant make|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: welcome to all|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: Hamman in his book castigated the jack-denies lead method. |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..and hi William|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: 3@D = transfer|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ciaran: Hi Martin|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: Reckoned it gave declarer more help than it was worth |pg||
nt|chick: how high will NS go in @Ds?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: As ever with these thngs, the truth is somewhere near the middle|pg||
nt|chick: looks like 4 is the limit|pg||
nt|frankaus: this action quite a contrast to th OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: PC technical problem with the CR NIBU NI match|pg||
nt|mdgraham: an enterprising 1@S overcall |pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: And James is right if EW bid 6 they will find the save|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one will take some work|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi David|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: normal enough to reach 4major when you have a 5-4 fit and some shape|pg||
nt|andyv:  and some help which the @c lead does provide|pg||
nt|athene: but south's values aren't exactly where north wants them|pg||
nt|petergill: Welcome to my co-commentator Frank Budai|pg||
pc|cK|nt|frankaus: 3NT here would be my choice aswell|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|petergill: South would balance with a Dbl if he was in the pass-out (last to speak, or balancing) position. |pg||
pc|c8|nt|mdgraham: duck a diamond|pg||
nt|james_h: whos buying?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  defence can well start with taking first 5 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't believe that this is the auction|pg||
nt|cuttysark: good afternoon|pg||
nt|ady: hi     late start|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ciaran: Looks like an easy 4S or a thin 6S here which will fail due to both trump honours being offside|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|frankaus: 10 quickly|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcarroll: OK - me|pg||
nt|james_h: Martin is a great team player|pg||
nt|athene: east had better jump in with the @DA and switch to a spad|pg||
nt|athene: spade|pg||
nt|andyv:  difficult hand to declare... when N goes after @ds, the @s switch will be obvious|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: good double - wrong ace for a maximum penalty godd still going down|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not yet though|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  been pushed too high    cant make 4 if diamonds attacjed early|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  but E seems to be unaware of the danger to the hand|pg||
nt|athene: well it's very hard for east - he doesn't know anything about declarer's hand|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: needed to win diamond ace first time really..|pg||
nt|andyv:  but he does know he has no tricks in @ds and @cs... @s suit is only hope|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think winning A of @d was all that difficult|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone and welcome to New Delhi|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry for the 1 hour delay|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: miskeyed.....will catch up at claiming|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Sunit|pg||
nt|sunit: hi all|pg||
nt|petergill: Trump lead gives declarer some work to do|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ady: attacked|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|h2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi James, Martin and specs I'm Frank from hot Norway. Just -23C now:)|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks to be -1 from here|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|h7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, the trump leads are very good defence. |pg||
pc|d4|nt|cuttysark: 5@C wasn't making either, but it is normal to take out insurance on hands like these|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: with the added advantage that the defence may not take the queen|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Frank|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Sinil     Liz|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|ciaran: when the wind is in your sails, these contracts make - a little unlucky for Hamilton and Ferguson|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mcarroll: A bit unfortunate - the bidding looks reasonable, unlucky to find the trumps stacked. So first imps to CBAIlookk|pg||
pc|h5|nt|frankaus: 11 now & may take @H fin for 12|pg||
nt|chick: wish I knew what 3@H meant .. might be a clue to whether to finesse @Hs or not|pg||
nt|mdgraham: high card raise to 3@S, I suspect|pg||
pc|s4|nt|james_h: North needs to establish @d because he cant draw t and ruff, 3@c and 1@h|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|wilkinsona: best of fortune re exams..|pg||
nt|athene: even if you know that declarer has a singleton diamond, it might sometimes be right to duck - give declarer @SAxx for instance|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
nt|athene: now rising the ace gives him pitches for both spades but if you duck he loses no diamond but two spades|pg||
nt|athene: but i agree it might have ben findable if east remembers his side needs FOUR tricks to beat this|pg||
nt|andyv:  as long as this isn't match points, rising with A of @d and switching to K of @s was called for. |pg||
nt|petergill: If the defence never touched trumps, declarer could probably hold his losses to only his five top losers|pg||
pc|h6|nt|frankaus: Value raise of @S would be my guess|pg||
pc|d8|pc|hT|pg||

nt|peachy: The other semifinal is MANY HANDS v. R L Kejriwal|pg||
nt|peachy: This should be an exciting match|pg||
nt|petergill: The third very strong team Texan Aces, who came 2nd in the European Championships in Turkey a few years ago, came 10th of 51 teams in the Qualifying and thus missed the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: quarter-finals|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|petergill: Kiran Nadar and her partner (Satya for short) have played many times in Bermuda Bowls, Beijing 2008, Yeh Cup and the like |pg||

nt|mcarroll: After 3 frantic boards - a little placidity?|pg||
nt|andyv:  in the open room, N made 5@h|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: NS rather got away with that I'm afraid..|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for standings, convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|mcarroll: well played to flatten the board|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: director has been called for settling a dispute|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: dispute resolved - scores remain the same|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   can make 4@H    may have difficulty getting there|pg||
nt|petergill: The defence at the other table correclty led trumps, but they switched away from trumps too early. |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: allowing declarer to ruff the club high |pg||
mb|1S|nt|chick: this bid won't make N's day any happier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tell us about the players Sunit, please|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S husband and wife as far as I recall|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: McGann dows not like passing |pg||

nt|Walddk2: I could be wrong |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hI liz|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rodal f: Ok. I can leave so they come back:)|pg||
nt|sunit: rajeev and himani are a husband- wife pair from Mumbai|pg||
nt|ady: north take-out double has given them a chance|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Yes 4@H is a great contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: X or 1nt here  - 1NT 4 me|pg||
mb|3D|nt|frankaus: S need to run |pg||
nt|andyv:  sometimes the obvious escapes us at the table|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like 2S is the last making contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: but bidding 2@d here is a poor IMPS bid|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I might have made a horrible takeout double with the South hand because of the 4-4 majors|pg||
mb|3N|nt|james_h: Hang on a min Rodal :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunit: I am not sure which Banerjee is this but must be from the railway team|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Too much, four obvious losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: we'll give you 2 more hands|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: I am surprised that S in Open did not bid|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H by north conservative|pg||
nt|petergill: South is disciplined enough to stop bidding, despite 19 HCP|pg||
nt|petergill: downgrading KQ doubleton, Frank? |pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: east liked the hidden diamond fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  now this one really does require a lot of work|pg||
nt|ady: by South   sorry|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if vul they may hav pushed on to game|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems a little conservative to me|pg||
pc|d3|nt|davidstern: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: yes this banerjee is from railways.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sunit: only way to beat this contract is after cashing both the clubs north has to play a heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, this may make now|pg||
nt|sunit: difficult though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Too late|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in modern bidding, strong dbl on 1N is out of date |pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|athene: you can be a lot more aggressive with hands like east's if you know it's a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  3 chances to make... slim, fat and none|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he expected 2@H to guarantee a 4th trump|pg||
nt|frankaus: yes the whole hand needs to be downgraged imo|pg||
pc|c2|nt|davidstern: This will make if declarer is careful in the trump suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Needed a heart lead|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c8|nt|andyv:  some use 2N (this time it would be by E) to find out what quality of raise partner gave them... it would have helped this time|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes E has assumed 4 hearts, and I think at least 3 diamonds and added a bit more as well|pg||
nt|athene: north has quite a lot of defensive cards not to double this|pg||
nt|athene: but his partner is a passed hand and he doesn't have any distributional surprises|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, E was a bit optomistic....2@h was already too high|pg||
nt|athene: and no-one forced east to bid game!|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 8 tricks only and no real pressure on E/W - i cant see a 9th ?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ciaran: the defense can get a cross ruff going here for -3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes in first position, but a balancing dbl over 2@H is very much in vogue|pg||
nt|davidstern: Still may be OK if he runs a heart from dummy|pg||
nt|sunit: no can still beat|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sunit: with a heart switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, whether South runs or not depends on your parameters for doubling 1NT   |pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South can be endplayed to lead away from @DK|pg||
nt|sunit: why?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Though I suppose if the heart finesse was wrong 4@H might not make|pg||
pc|c4|nt|wilkinsona: whereas west cards were in spades where he thought they werent|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mcarroll: Me neither|pg||
nt|sunit: no he can exit a trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what trump? I cash all my trumps but one|pg||
nt|sunit: no endplay here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What are you going to throw on the spades?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|petergill: Good club lead - this looks like 200 to NS|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|frankaus: with a flattish 1 count u know this is not a gr8 spot|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h4|nt|mcarroll: Unless the defence slip|pg||
nt|davidstern: The defence have now put this at risk by forcing declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'll watch your discards and endplay you|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|james_h: 1imp pick up here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: agreed, if you are certain partner cannot hold (for example) AKQJ sixth  plus an ace |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ciaran: Surprisingly, north didn't overcall at the other table|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  this auction needs to go back to the drawing board|pg||

nt|petergill: West passed his 12 count, donwngrading the singleton queen|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: west hand is a problem hand for the weak nters as you can (and they have) missed their spade fit.  With such decent @s's i'd have opened 1@s|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 7@S makes..|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: on repeated trump leads this can fail|pg||
nt|ady: playing 6@S  a decent score|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C inverted minor raise|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, not inverted minor, 1@C must be Strong Club|pg||
mb|4C|nt|james_h: I dont believe South has shown his clubs naturally, he may have implied them|pg||
nt|rodal f: Should be implied now so 4@C to come?|pg||
nt|james_h: the fact the 3h is not alerted makes me think its just natural|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: looks as if they might pefewr the 4-4 fit... unfortunately|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C would be 5+ clubs, 8+ points, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgh: Late alert of 3H|pg||
nt|ciaran: Well bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@H looks like an overbid |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D and 2@S natural|pg||
nt|petergill: EW in game-forcing auction |pg||
mb|4D|nt|james_h: ok, south must have shown clubs |pg||
nt|po-s: he has shown clubs when he doesn´t rebid NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: the 4@D cue does not improve the E hand so they quit in time|pg||
nt|davidstern: Combined 24 cound stopped well short |pg||
nt|sunit: can be beaten by 2 tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT Pass 3@D should excite East|pg||

mb|4N|nt|rodal f: Hei Peo|pg||
nt|james_h: I think McG will drive this bus home now in the snow|pg||
nt|vinbtech: and a 9 card minor fit to boot as well|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el is the tourney website|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|andyv:  lacking the spot cards, 4th best (or low for some) is the best lead with the W cards in @ds|pg||
nt|athene: will declarer try to steal a spade to make?|pg||
nt|vinbtech: though 3n is far from easy; a tempo behind imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: well at  least they will get a plus score     might even turn out to be a good score for e/w if in CR they get overboard in a heart slam|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D shows 4@S 3@D 5@C and thus only one @h opposite Axxx = perfect, so heading for 6@D or even (unlikely) 7@D |pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Nice to see that Mike Lawrence has so many fans in India. They even named a club after him as you see on the scoreboard|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|sunit: now only 1 down|pg||
nt|xenya: i thought W would pass, then bid 2@S if needed|pg||
nt|petergill: Not looking for 7@D, as West is a passed hand, and "8 trumps" is not enough for 7@D to be a good % chance|pg||

mb|2N|an| |mb|p|mb|3C|an| |mb|p|nt|petergill: From the notes attached to their CC, on Bd 2, 2@D response to artificial GF 2@C = any minimum (11 to bad 14), so 2@S was 4+ clubs, about 15+ , and 4@C was RKCB|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C = 5413 shape|pg||

nt|petergill: 2NT asked|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|petergill: This time trumps are 3-2, but the bad side suit breaks make 6@H difficult to manage on club leads|pg||

nt|james_h: sorry Rodal, this it too tame for me|pg||
nt|james_h: I demand more "fast lane" hands|pg||
nt|mcarroll: but this time the @S save is too expensive|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And might even aggravate the opps into the grand|pg||
nt|po-s: spade save is 2000 I think|pg||
nt|po-s: and 7clubs more|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1700 might enough|pg||
nt|james_h: West is considering her options|pg||
nt|po-s: right, I counted 6 spade tricks, forgot the ruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  no reason for W to fly with the Ace|pg||
nt|athene: if his partner has the @HA there's no rush anyway|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, should have hoped for a missguess it seems..|pg||
nt|davidstern: Easy 4@S here|pg||
nt|davidstern: But need to get there |pg||
nt|ady: around a 20 imps swing on the heart split   mind you 6@H is not a great contract    needs decent trump split  plus spade finesse|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice 4@S for N/S if they get there|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another game for NS|pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid at both tables|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk5: How are you going to bid a grand slam with any accuracy when opps bid spades like mad as happened in the other matches?|pg||
nt|james_h: opening 1@c with this hand when looking at the NS (terrifying animals :) ) may not be appealing|pg||
nt|po-s: is 2C clubs or strong?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: Very favourable layout here for E/W - @SQJ doubleton, @DQ9 onside, @C 3-3, @HJ right|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not a classical weak 2, but I know a lot of players who would open 2@S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|james_h: clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: By exlution blackwood EW should have a easy line til 7|pg||
nt|andyv:  OR somehow found and made 3@c here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the north hand wd probably have been opened in 3rd or 1st position|pg||
nt|frankaus: cansino suggests pass|pg||
mb|d|nt|ciaran: E worth an invite with two Axxx suits opposite a 15-17 NT, |pg||
nt|ady: 4@S can be beaten if clubs played before declarer can establish diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: thats with A@H right |pg||
mb|1N|nt|james_h: its an underbid but she gets a chance to rev theing up now|pg||
nt|james_h: things|pg||
nt|po-s: I doubt that|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A bit surprising S did not show both Majors?|pg||
nt|james_h: lets see|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but unlikely as @Hq is a stand out lead|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rodal f: P??|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Is 2@C really a limited opening? I mean, after all she has a 3 loser hand. Impossible to catch up later I predict. I agree with PO|pg||
nt|james_h: Ciara(West) in crying|pg||
nt|po-s: now South|pg||
nt|james_h: I'm sure|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 21 points and the opps have ignored you ... and found a fit ... |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good sign for finding fit with partner - N must be short in @h|pg||
nt|ady: still west can go up with the ace and switch to a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Good Pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  10 tricks will fall on S's lap|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone here like not leading pd's suit?|pg||
nt|athene: it's sensible to not lead partner's suit if you have one of your own|pg||
nt|athene: but eschewing the spade lead with a doubleton, just for KQx, seems a bit weird|pg||
nt|andyv:  i agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: @H and this may suceed|pg||
nt|james_h: South must smell a rat as he likes to balance|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  game in @c looks attractive|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: only fit left is @C's  - I like A 2NT gets the values across and N is marked with a few @s's on the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: E has an interesting problem here .... N didn't choose NT without a good stopper in @Hs|pg||
nt|chick: so is one of his black suits better chance to set?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's a lead declarer didn't want to see  |pg||
nt|james_h: this is an EW implosion|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes they dont have the theoretical points required, but maybe they will take the view that 3NT may be as likely as 2?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Will probably stop in 2N and be thankful to make|pg||
nt|xenya: courageous bid, 4@S |pg||
pc|c5|nt|wilkinsona: may concern declarer though..|pg||
nt|andyv:  rule of 6 should have told declarer not to hold up|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Nonvulnerable game - not usually right to stretch|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: even more unlikely into the aq10 :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|wilkinsona: yep, spade now gives south some losing options...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Panja|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Panja|pg||
nt|nerio24: hi|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks made in closed room   playing in 3 spades|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: not sure of the EW system here....2@D either a straightforward Multi (so to speak) or possibly a bad-suit weak two|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If they do play clubs East must win the first diamond - West has to duck his king...|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am told that Mike Lawrence has a carryover of 2 IMPs, not included on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|panja: so a Club ruff is the fourth trick for the defence?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  idee fixe|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S plays 4NT in Open|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: told 2@D=5-7, 5+cards|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  red lead brings 8th trick, what about 9th?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: not sure about the 3@h bid seems a bit much - then again 3@s looks like a make and opposite @sHx even with the known 4+ @s with east woukd have good chances|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: sorry, 0-7 hcp|pg||
nt|ady: I dont think unlikely Sunil  with tht diamond suit there to provide discards|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: when you try a speculative lead and declarer ducks, you always hope you found a good thing|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mcarroll: S really doesn't want to lead any suit|pg||
nt|ciaran: What was Hamilton's 2D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: Some alerts have not been entered in this auction|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|davidstern: Can certainly understand this auction - north unfoirtunately has a very good 2@S bid and east has a small amount of interest only|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|hT|nt|xenya: yes, a passive defence should do the job|pg||
pc|hK|nt|po-s: Probably there was a West face when Pass came back|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Well, the crux of the matter is that the West hand is too good for 2@C|pg||
nt|james_h: lol PO|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder why W is so reluctant to lead pd's suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Difficult decsion whether to ruff high or not|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in  |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3@S discard @C|pg||
pc|h2|nt|panja: @C8 does not tell anything to East|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el|pg||
nt|xenya: the fact that declarer didn't try to cash the @CK indicates he has another club|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|panja: good point|pg||
pc|s5|nt|wilkinsona: well, E seemed to encourage, and if so maybe wrong..|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: If the @C's broke 2/2 and hugh was able to sneak the @c9 into dummy this would make as it is hes blocked|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mcarroll: 2@C is 5 card Stayman so 2@D denies|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: in which case there's far less long-term future in spades|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: possible end play here - W is probably going to discard 3@h and now @ha and another should produce 2@d tricks|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in 4@S probably ruff high|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kdr_fm: using the entry to finesse @D and play for split @d honours it looks like|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: west is sure the missing spades are 5-4, rather than 6-3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2 more rounds of @c would have been better |pg||

pc|s9|nt|sfoxa:  next door S managed to take 9 tricks|pg||

nt|athene: if that isn't the case, west was just illogical - why not bid 7@H over 5?|pg||

nt|athene: a very embarrassing flat board there for both teams :)|pg||

nt|xenya: any other lead followed by a low clun would have almost certainly beaten it |pg||
nt|xenya: *club|pg||
nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|petergill: whereas East passed his 11 count on Bd 27 as it was 4333 and short of aces, and on Bd 26 West didn't like the bare queen in his 12 count, and could not open 1@C as it was Strong ...|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgh: She did|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this looks a desperate try by west..|pg||
nt|athene: it might be hard for NS to catch 2@C, with their trumps 3-3|pg||

nt|vinbtech: Hobson's Choice really|pg||
nt|vinbtech: and comes to the same 9 tricks|pg||
nt|frankaus: thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: thanks Christine|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3NT by south not seeing all the hands seems a fair spot|pg||
nt|davidstern: Are EW playing strong club?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Or has he simply avoided a reverse rebid|pg||
nt|vinbtech: y precision i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  with 19hcp, S is not going away|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Trivial 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Standard, EW play Strong Club|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcarroll: The Open Room must have crashed, so we are not getting comparisons, but they bid and made 4@S on this board|pg||
nt|ciaran: 2H is a good result for N/S since it looks like E/W will make 2S, though it might be hard to get into the auction|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3@S asking for a @S stop|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  who will play this board will be disappointed heavily - all possible honours are off side|pg||

nt|athene: 2@S is the best they can do at this point i guess|pg||
nt|frankaus: NS lead by 20 imps before this set|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ciaran: 2C from N forces 2D from S, and 2H is then to play|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: again they decide not to push for the nonvul game|pg||

nt|athene: but they can't get there|pg||
nt|andyv:  W can't move|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: east should have bid 2@D then redoubled that, to show 44 majors|pg||
nt|vinbtech: 4H should prevail |pg||

pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: running to 2@H like this sounds like 5 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: e thinking|pg||
nt|petergill: As South denied 4 spades (else South would rebid 1@S), 2@S is a safe rebid, cannot be raised to 4@S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: thanks operator|pg||
nt|ciaran: May not have been E thinking - they are playing with screens|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  the Italian teams of the 60s made a fortune by not opening 1N with 4-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|athene: alternatively east could redouble|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he wanted to declare himself - didn't want the lead coming through all his tenaces|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: There was some ask for clarification of NS auction|pg||
nt|ciaran: Brave double from Hamilton should pick up 6 IMPs|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: hugh will be thinking what did i do to deserve that .. lovely contract nice lead ...|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||

pc|d2|nt|vinbtech: w/ E showing minors and 2H, the S9 should provide the 10th trick|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now a sneaky @S6 |pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: The cold is affecting me!|pg||
nt|athene: but EW could still organise it so that they scramble to 2@S by east|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|s6|nt|athene: for example let's say east bids 2@D then redoubles|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: and now west wants to play 2@S but from the other side|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: What about conceding two diamonds and claim?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spades are irrelevant|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: sso *he* bids 2@H and then redoubles that!|pg||
nt|vinbtech: y thats right|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: cant really see how to make  going up with A@C  does not solve anything either|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C is on, but is not a great contract, needs no @H ruff, clubs to break and (if played by South) @SK onside|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  I don't know if EW have that sophisticated of a partnership|pg||
nt|athene: this also has the advantage that partner has to suffer :) and you can go off and find a danish pastry and coffee  vendor|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Unusual for East not to bid again when North balanced. However, he decided against (1NT) because of the vulnerability|pg||

mb|2D|an| |mb|p|nt|mdgraham: that's a more solid-looking weak two |pg||
nt|frankaus: good W2@H|pg||
nt|chick: probably a good weak 2, as opposed to bidding a multi-like 2D|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to set 6@h which is practically cold and find out it's a push|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Difference of style; in the other room South opened 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
mb|2H|nt|james_h: tactical 1@s ... prefering to opening 1@c|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  3@s relay to 3N?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 6 clubs from south looks ok now|pg||
nt|andyv:  good 6@c hand here|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: unusual|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nasty for W will he pass|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|mdgraham: yes, an opening 2@d says that you haven't got an opening bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  I play it that way|pg||
nt|athene: it looks here as though it's clubs, though|pg||
nt|ciaran: Lucky 12 tricks here with @C breaking and both diamonds onside|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: In the open Room, EW bid and made 2@S|pg||
nt|eamongall: Oops I slept in |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Eamon|pg||
nt|andyv:  but NS may play it strictly as a @c xfer|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Minimum for the strong type|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mcarroll: Yes - either minor suit slam works but probably not biddable|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But they seem to be edging towards it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North trying to show a really good diamond raise - cannot have spades|pg||
nt|petergill: I would pass, like Kachchu|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: lost connection.....back on track|pg||
nt|petergill: A club lead would solve declarer's club guess |pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: @H lead knocks this|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: E digging a deeper hole|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: Hi Eamon, did the snow eat your internet?|pg||
nt|eamongall: looks like I missed some imps ..boards 1 3 4 ... but its ok ..there is still 25 boards in this match so maybe another 100 imps to be shared |pg||
nt|andyv:  or MSS and S's 6@c was p/c|pg||
nt|andyv:  either way, good contract|pg||
nt|ciaran: I'm giving up on predictions :)|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: unfortunate - by north unlikely E would find a @h lead ... may well lead to a swing if open room N playing str NT  1NT - 3NT|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Easy 140 but 2 IMPs to MLC|pg||

nt|ciaran: Looks like a very lucky pickup for CBAI|pg||
nt|mcarroll: impressive though|pg||

nt|andyv:  i think 3N is right....the 2@s bid in closed room at least told declarer where his tricks were coming from|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 2@H has a couple of flaws|pg||

nt|xenya: looked like 11 tricks to me|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: chance for Glyco;s to make up by bidding the vul game here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Glycols|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another very thin game - slim chance for Glycols to gain a few imps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the overcall worked this time|pg||
nt|andyv:  difficult to play for that @c layout though|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sfoxa:  and 5@h coming next? really cruel board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you are going to pre-empt, I like 3@H better than 2 at these colours|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes with the @D fin on 9 tricks roll in|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: I think we won't see any more imps in this match ... rooms not joined it appears |pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, 2@s in OR|pg||
nt|ciaran: Tight 3N for N/S here.  Looks like an accident for NIBU in the other room - playing in 5HX|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: time for a pairs 2@s ?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  nice tip|pg||

mb|2H|nt|eamongall: Carrot Club here .. .weak or strong |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes Roland3@H might have stolen the board|pg||
nt|petergill: India is pretty good at bridge - India sometimes makes the quarter-finals of the World Championships|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: 1nt?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4-6 is not a two-suiter in my view|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here's the multi again|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Particularly not with a rotten 4-card suit and a great 6-carder|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: esp when the 6 carder is strong and the 4 carder weak|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what was 2@S ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Preference|pg||
mb|p|nt|nerio24: preference|pg||

nt|andyv:  2N now by W?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: right|pg||
nt|ady: hi all     sorry a little late|pg||
nt|petergill: Some of the top Italians have abandoned 3@C and 3@D weak jump overcalls, and would overcall 3@C on these East cards to show 6 clubs and 4 spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I would|pg||
mb|d|nt|mcarroll: pick a slam?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello David|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el is the tournry website and gives the results of the swiss league and the 8 qualifiers|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Both Souths pass 1@H - I think it is right to raise with 4-card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Yes the Carvey preemptive tactics pushed them too far|pg||
nt|ady: ok    thx|pg||
nt|xenya: hello David|pg||

nt|andyv:  N could have had a great result by passing 2@h|pg||
mb|3D|nt|nerio24: hi David|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Playing a strong club your hand cannot be very strong|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but hard for south to envision game after his ptr has passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: I dont like 1@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: inviting trouble|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@S by E in Open|pg||
nt|james_h: Ok, I MUST like it now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: Well, 4S makes, so -800 not a disaster against the -790 for 4SX|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I don't think he can|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't either... but with that vul and S not making any game try, pass may not be so bad|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: similar to last hand in a way|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sunsamvar: so a push|pg||
nt|cuttysark: True - but when he has 9 red cards....|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be able to make 3@d |pg||
pc|sA|nt|kdr_fm: cold on a dummy reversal type play @SAK and another then play for @C 3/2 AK and finally Q with @s set up|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sunsamvar: -150 may be a great score for N/S|pg||
nt|petergill: Only 4 boards to go in the match, with NS leading by 25 imps|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: :)|pg||
nt|ciaran: N/S were clearly on different wavelengths about the second double|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, as with 3@C if it makes the so did 3N|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm not sure what W hoped to get with the dbl... only suit he can really support is @c (and possibly @hs) while 2N seems just too obvious.|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||

pc|cT|pc|h2|pg||
nt|andyv:  this helps|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: alternatively 3 rounds of clubs and finesse diamond seems more straight forwar|pg||

mb|3S|nt|mdgraham: old joke - passed out? How did the bidding go?|pg||
nt|ciaran: that should help E find the lead! (assuming S bid 5D and W doubled)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ciaran: Looks like 6S has play - only a diamond from E puts it under pressure. Even then, can make I think|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Another doomed marginal slam|pg||
nt|eamongall: I just came over from OPen to see this board |pg||
nt|kdr_fm: looks like 4@d, 2@h, 2@c + 1@s|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Unless they play here and east misguesses clubs, of course.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 5@C is a great contract   but with K@H with west might fail unless he leads a heart|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Yes time for me to have a nice Scottish malt Liz|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: even worse, now bids 4!|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: looks like an 11 trick hand to me ...but 12 was made in other room |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well 5@C is a far better contract requiring only the @Hk with the opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: not me, cansino points or no, N has nothing to justify an opening in my book|pg||
nt|james_h: almost a slam here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks like with the odds, just needs the last trump in dummy to score, ie 3-2 break|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The consensus here seems to agree |pg||

nt|Walddk2: Who promised us that bridge is fair?|pg||

pc|dA|nt|eamongall: Murchan is lucky he is not in a slam ....opening with that kind of "put in your own word" |pg||

nt|vugraphzgh: Bidding as correcter|pg||
nt|ciaran: My predictions have been wrong so far, but I back Padraig to make this.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, a spade lead gets @CK into play|pg||

nt|eamongall: I believe this is the Northern Ireland 2 team ...made up from finishers 4 5 and 6 in their trials |pg||
nt|andyv:  well, that was one break:)|pg||
nt|athene: there were a lot of indications available to north there|pg||
nt|athene: his partner ruffed with the @DQ so probably hasn't got another trump|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Well done - and your predictions are back on track Ciaran|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: if he found lead from AJx i'd be stunned|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 34: 11 easy tricks in 3NT, the play at the end might not have been exactly as recorded|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chick: well he did get his clubs, right after the opps got 6 tricks :)|pg||
nt|athene: also pass then 2@H suggests 4-6 in the majors|pg||
nt|petepunt: orob weak nt from dafjones|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: another Maltish hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: how will East go about this one?|pg||
nt|athene: also the @H10 is suit-preference for spades|pg||
nt|vicky888: unlucky EWs at other table|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not as many as +470 would have brung|pg||
nt|andyv:  this auction should die quickly|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  I agree Bill... I don't think @s return was that hard to find but N didn't want to lead away from K@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: BBO players teabag1 and The Bishop ... make up the team (Mike Coffey and John Lavery ) |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Rather strange that West did not lead @CK in the other rom...|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: club lead stand out from both sides|pg||
mb|3H|nt|frankaus: 4@S immediatly would be my choice|pg||
nt|chick: bid both of his suits|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone like N's dbl?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   have to p lay 4@H   on 4-3 fit  to make game    assuming a club lead in no-trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: I knew Padraig would not let me down!|pg||
nt|ady: or cam make 5@D|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so DSM LOOK AS IF THEY ARE RUNNING AWAY WITH THIS q/f|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl is dangerous at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|vicky888: too weak for tht jump??|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess 3@h is not GF|pg||
nt|andyv:  W likes that bid|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mdgraham: that looks suspiciously forcing |pg||
nt|mdgraham: but is 5@D natural now, or simply a cue bid?|pg||
nt|chick: don't know, but either will do|pg||
nt|chick: I'll bet he passes though|pg||
nt|frankaus: we have a 9 card M fit wit game values|pg||
nt|chick: bad suits, doesn't know if pard has the honors in the right places|pg||
nt|chick: (which he doesn't)|pg||
nt|frankaus: opp a weak NT  slam is a minor miracle |pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: She!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@S asks for Majors and strength|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW took 8 tricks in OR. what about doing the same in defence?|pg||
nt|petepunt: both @d wrong prob 2 off|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgh: Michelle Brunner|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Sry for caps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: South seems to be getting the diamonds into the game, but it is alwyas hard to diagnose opposing doubletons|pg||
nt|petergill: Had South pased the Double, EW would have been in serious trouble|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mcarroll: 3@C has to be max without a Major|pg||
nt|ciaran: the bad diamond break dooms 3N here|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 5 tricks will be good going.  May try @sA and @d finesse playing W for @dHx or HHx|pg||
nt|petergill: East has only 3 tricks and no more, so the vulnerable Double without any suit texture is very risky|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vicky888: flat board it seems|pg||
nt|nerio24: should be -1|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what is the best way to play the @H suit ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Low towards the jack|pg||
nt|vicky888: play a low heart to jack, |pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: west will be happy with this lead|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|eamongall: I am informed I am wrong |pg||
nt|eamongall: about the team|pg||
nt|james_h: Hanlon was taking insurance with 4@s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: First imps to NI|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: over the last few hands NS have played very well it seems...|pg||
nt|andyv:  they certainly have made good decisions|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..and have bid this well|pg||
nt|andyv:  Board 10 not returning a @s is about the only play that I can be critical on|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H was quite pushy|pg||
nt|andyv:  it is but it works... hard to argue with success... I do it all the time and haven't found anyone to listen:)|pg||
nt|athene: well, it works if he makes this :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  is there that much to the play?|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see any way it can't make|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west coming to the same conclusion I think...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only one loser if East has Honour10|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sunsamvar: and in the 2nd round|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I would have thuoght club was even more obvious in the other room where West had bid spades and not been supported|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: can play east for Q10 or K10 dblton   or either hand for KQ doubleton|pg||
nt|ady: same contract  aalso by North make in CR|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|james_h: How date he lost us IMPs|pg||
nt|james_h: dare|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|kdr_fm: up to 6 now|pg||
nt|nerio24: Alok who was east was having a bad day|pg||
nt|andyv:  even if NS are playing a strong @c system, 3@h is still an overbid when no fit has been found|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|james_h: Tom used to be better at insurance|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: 3@H is quite a good bid, as it acts as a system-tester. Do EW have the capability to stop in 3@S if that is the limit of the hand, or do they have to bid to 4@S and go off  |pg||
nt|james_h: (his former career)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes my question is in the second round do you play for !KQ or H10 ?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mcarroll: But then he got a better offer!|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ciaran: can test diamonds, then play on H and end up taking a S finesse for a 9th trick, but you're then 2 off|pg||
pc|d6|nt|eamongall: I am wrong ... I just thought as no sign of Greenwood Anderson on this team ..it had to be the 2nd team |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Time to thank our wonderful operator in Delhi|pg||

mb|1S|nt|athene: interesting auction in the other room|pg||

nt|vicky888: has to be|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: some pairs play 1minor (1nt) 2minor = both majors|pg||
nt|ciaran: Could be more IMPS for NIBU here - E's 10 count was worth a game bid opposite a 14-16 NT, but they may stay lower here due to playing a different range|pg||
nt|petepunt: looks good for 20-22|pg||
nt|nerio24: wow|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Yes Raja had been royally good :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Some players would respond 4@D with the East hand - 5-5Majors, no slam interest|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: SF at 9:30 am IST|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision-style|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@h seems middle of the road... you can bid 4@h and opps will always bid 4@s or you can pass and hope to buy the hand later.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: There was none - but it is scored as making|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Nice gadget|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kdr_fm: schance here 6@c is on|pg||

nt|mcarroll: In Open E backed in with 3@C after much the same auction and plays there|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: got away|pg||
nt|vicky888: tripathi lost the opportunity to gain 9 IMPs and settled for 3 here|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: thanks all....esp. the commentators and BBO team|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: ignore my last comment --it's the other way round|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Means doing without Texas transfers, but here it gets the lead to the right hand|pg||
nt|petergill: North might raise this to 6@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: wow, that's an unusual lead choice|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yep|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This auction will inevitably make the weaker hand declarer|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he did|pg||
nt|andyv:  they own the @s suit...no choice with that vul|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's why pass has a lot of merit|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk4: Undo please|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: sorry QF 3/3 tom. 9:30 IST not SF|pg||
nt|Walddk4: East bid 4@D|pg||
nt|frankaus: 6@S looks to make 6@S 5@C +@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@H cold|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petepunt: 6@C tough to bid|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: returned a heart didnt cash @CJ ?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: K10xx rather than KQxx|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe not|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It makes little sense to me to enter the auction at the 4-level|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Acceptable with a different type of suit, but A109xxx is rather asking for trouble|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: North is probably trying to salvage something from a bad session|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Better at favourable vulnerability|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but he knows the majors are breaking badly... so why i wonder|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think East will bid 4@H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i would|pg||
nt|vugraphzdz: E in think mode|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It will cost a million and a half on the mandatory trump lead|pg||
nt|vicky888: difficult for N to judge tht|pg||
nt|vbman: this 8 carder is a computer dealt hand|pg||
nt|vbman: in such hands the dealer doesnt let u out in the cold|pg||
pc|dA|nt|petergill: Results at http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Mohanlal_Bhartiya/2010/Results.el|pg||
nt|vbman: especially if the opps have a fit|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ciaran: should make 9 tricke for 5 IMPs to NIBU|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Wrong again :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not sure where East got a slam invite from|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the 4@D bid tells East that bad breaks are posssible and his ptrs @D points are probably wasted|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But I think he will escape the double and so not lose much|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so the salvage operation worked like a dream|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk4: He is about @SK short of an slam invite imo|pg||
pc|dT|nt|petergill: North's case for 6@S is that parner must have many spades to bid "5 over 5" in front of partner, and the kings figure to be onside in opener's hand|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  seems so|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: would have been a dream had 4@H made in the other room  IE|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cuttysark: If West's double is penalty showing values in diamonds he cannot have the right cards|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|athene: i should have thought the @DK lead is far less likely to give away a trick|pg||
nt|athene: you know the @DA is almost certainly over you|pg||
nt|athene: but club lead could have found declarer with the queen|pg||
nt|andyv:  the lack of spot cards in the @d suit makes it almost even odds with a @c lead|pg||
nt|athene: or even something like Jxx with declarer, AQx in dummy|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the pips in diamonds are poor so I go with Easts lead|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good try from Micheal - hoping partner has @HKx |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 8 i guess with everyone bidding close vul games these days, defenders shd also be trigger happy on the double button when the trumps break badly|pg||
nt|andyv:  S needs to get out of his own way... has to cash Ace of @s|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|james_h: and struck gold|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yep|pg||
nt|james_h: another example of fortune favouring the bold|pg||
nt|petergill: Part of the case for North to pass 5@S is that if 5@s scores 680 it might be a pick-up anyway against 200 or 500 at the other table|pg||
nt|petergill: 650 is still secure|pg||
nt|petergill: South could claim 650 if he wants to|pg||
nt|petergill: Well done to R L Kejriwal team, who join Formidables and two other teams in the 48 board semi finals|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: don't think East ruffed that @CK |pg||
nt|xenya: not exactly an inspired defence?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: This is a great hand for the 1nt opener to be showing a 5-5 in majors and getting his ptr to declare 4 of a major|pg||
pc|d7|nt|petergill: A @d back --> ruff, trump king, club ruff high, draw trumps |pg||
pc|s5|nt|frankaus: bye all|pg||
nt|petergill: The top two teams in this event qualify to represent India in the Commonwealth Games Bridge Championship in New Delhi in October|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|chick: what you say is right, Mike, but in cases like this, all you really want to do is make pard pick one of your two suits|pg||

pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: as you would far rather be in a 6-2 fit than a 5-2 fit|pg||
nt|chick: If the 5-2 suit is trump and badly split, maybe yes, but I think most of the time, you will lose the same tricks in either contract.  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: rather thought South would get the diamonds right there |pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, you might get forced as well - as is being graphically demonstrated here |pg||

nt|vugraphzgh: Welcome to everyone and thanks|pg||
nt|andyv:  S would like N to not dbl|pg||
nt|vbman: most dont balance with dbl in such hands|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wouldn't on this one|pg||
nt|andyv:  puts too much pressure on partner|pg||
nt|vbman: but the vuln and side strenth|pg||
mb|p|nt|vicky888: 3nt makes here|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgh: That is how it was explained to South|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@C inverted?|pg||
nt|frankaus: nicely rightsided|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: Hi |pg||
nt|james_h: This is a battle between a 2 wal club NS and a 1 way club EW|pg||
nt|james_h: way|pg||
nt|andyv:  if EW are playing precision, dbl of 2S should have shown max for the bidding but hardly inviting E to keep bidding|pg||
nt|mcarroll: a good Pass fro W|pg||
nt|andyv:  who invited W?|pg||
nt|andyv:  S better pull!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: from|pg||
nt|andyv:  smart:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  and N is a sadist to allow S to sit for the rdbl|pg||
mb|2H|nt|james_h: Nice work by NS here, 2NT a good raise, 3d a trial bid (I expect)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: well, if East leads back a heart....question is, could the lead be from KJ10|pg||
nt|frankaus: will they find the killing defence?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: not sure why south didn't jump on 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: 1h is make or 1 down but they want to stay awake|pg||
nt|vicky888: that rdbl was sos??|pg||
nt|andyv:  1H should be cold|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't know why W redbld... have to trust pd sometime|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: take the money and run.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I count 5 clubs, 4 diamonds, and a spade.  next :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  exciting hand... somehow the feeling is N could have done better|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vbman: he hadto bid a game somewhere and let partner try to make it|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vicky888: much of give and take of IMPs does really happen during bidding... its like plz take some IMPs!! No, No... i dont need that many IMPs, lets settle for fewer... kidding :)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|james_h: the @hk really punished McGann|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andyv:  :))|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|athene: east would have been better-off to bid a weak jump shift 3@H over 1@S|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sfoxa:  as usually, in CR we started with 2 last boards|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mcarroll: Second borderline 4@S in a row for Hanlon Mcgann - just the type of situation in which they thrive|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like -1|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that wasn't available for him|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s7|pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|andyv:  and CR has tightened the score to  35-34|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|mcarroll: I didnt pay enough attention to the @C pips - this is not making|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Tony Wilkinson|pg||
