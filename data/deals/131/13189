nt|Walddk2: This sounds pretty forcing to me|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: He is a passed hand - must make some diffenerence|pg||
nt|arigun: well, 3@d is too much to me since it's game forcing|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Some play the sequence as invitational|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mind you, this may make|pg||
nt|arigun: depens on lead, yeah|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cuttysark: Nast lead problem for South|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or even a nasty one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer will surely spurn the finesse after that lead, but can he come to 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can't count more than 9, can you?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cuttysark: I think so - not so easy if South led a low spade|pg||
nt|arigun: gib can not also :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What GIB can is not so important|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In fact, I think that button should be greyed out for commentators|pg||

nt|arigun: i think playing low @s from dummy was good idea... pitching @c's to @h's is not a good idea since dummy's trumps are forced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It will help if Delle Cave overruffs. Best is to pitch|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: hello everyone|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Rens :)|pg||
nt|daman: just getting set to begin|pg||
nt|daman: 2 countries who are clearly hooked on bridge playing each other|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: yes ns polish club with 2@c weak majors|pg||
nt|haans: Hi and Welcome to http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=80&Itemid=72|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: hi Hans|pg||
nt|hawe45:  hi|pg||
nt|haans: hi all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: hello all, I am Jacco Hop I will be the operator for this set|pg||
nt|szalay: 3N is makeable N-S|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Hans |pg||
nt|hawe45:  thks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This MUST BE a coffee-board - I vote for 450 and no swing|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H/@S EW|pg||
mb|1C|an|2+|nt|szalay: anyone 4 3@C pre?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|szalay: I strongly believe its an option in white|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Owen Lien and Doug Dey are players from North Carolina (District 7)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hey buddies, gl operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: things are going wrong with the boards|pg||
nt|haans: what should nilsen bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i can live withh 1N|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 NT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome back|pg||
nt|szalay: doubt they will bid it|pg||
nt|chick: 3N unspecified splinter?|pg||
nt|szalay: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: S  was our operator in last match |pg||
nt|yuval10: W is Giampietro, Cristina|pg||
nt|daman: would we double with the South hand?|pg||
nt|haans: double?|pg||
nt|daman: or would we bid 2@C?    2@H?|pg||
nt|daman: pass is not an option|pg||
nt|haans: diamond will win|pg||
nt|chick: 2@H would be my choice|pg||
nt|haans: 2+ is alertable|pg||
nt|daman: it really doesn't matter because West will always compete in @Ds|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|haans: overbidding|pg||
nt|daman: 2@D must be a transfer|pg||
nt|chick: transfer advances?|pg||
nt|haans: if they make 1ntx they get 180|pg||
nt|daman: oui|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: there are chances for going overboard, funny hand first up|pg||
nt|szalay: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: n/s may get to game in no-trumps    likely to go down|pg||
nt|haans: yep |pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=76|pg||
nt|szalay: I suppose 2@H was both majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: you can find list of participants, and standings on that site|pg||
nt|szalay: btw its a bit strange North didnt open|pg||
nt|szalay: probably 4@D SPL is the best bid by West|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|ady: will e/e  steal the contract    n/s can make a lucky 3NT  and make and make a safer contract in diamonds  10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: Israel play stad Israeli, I believe: strong NT, 5 card major, etc.|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: EW play natural, I think|pg||
nt|frankaus: not me  - 4 @S  would tempt me|pg||
nt|frankaus: then i'm a senior|pg||
nt|szalay: match starts with a boring 3N|pg||
nt|haans: doomed|pg||
nt|sybarra: and S has no further interest |pg||
nt|szalay: I dont suggest spl with 3 trumps only|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh, sorry,  S is brother of operator of last match |pg||
nt|chick: nor do I|pg||
nt|chick: E will leave that with his heart holding|pg||
nt|daman: West will balance|pg||
mb|p|nt|VugraphPl1: http://michzimny.pl/bridge/2010/pila/gp.html|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 3NT    but hardly bidable|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=80&Itemid=72  for participants |pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW have 9 tricks as the cards are placed, agree.|pg||
nt|szalay: ok, u can drink coffee, he will make it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I suggest - but do not support|pg||
nt|chick: many people like to play 1@S 4@H as natural hearts, so 3N gives a way to make a heart splinter|pg||
nt|chick: but in this hand, I would just bid a 2/1 2@D (or other game force)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So would we all, I think|pg||
nt|haans: diamond will win|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: 2@H open room so will be a push|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 NT checking for slam ambitions|pg||
nt|chick: imho, S is not strong enough for 2N|pg||
nt|haans: no stop there|pg||
nt|yuval10: T@s looks like the natural lead|pg||
nt|haans: many nowday bid 2nt invite or better|pg||
nt|yuval10: link for results : http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/|pg||
nt|yuval10: click on "competitie"|pg||
nt|chick: W already neglected to bid @Ds, would be surprised to see him come in at the 3 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: do we have running scores Jacco?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: last time i saw Owen in Tri City (West Columbia) sectional, he is 21 y.o., educating in Economics branch in NC State College|pg||
nt|haans: clubs lead?|pg||
nt|haans: best|pg||
nt|ady: even on the lead will go down on a heart switch|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|haans: that double is new|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: well EW can make 6@D|pg||
nt|szalay: but if u have singleton, better to show it yourself|pg||
nt|daman: it was OK for him to pass 2@D    he was going to get anpther chance to bid|pg||
mb|3C|nt|szalay: after given bidding best trump play (double hook) is even better|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: ok, u can try 6@D, but its terrible...long run I dont suggest slams with 30 hcp and 2 balanced hands|pg||
nt|szalay: bid your games, take your tricks (by Hamman) is good advice in any level|pg||
nt|sybarra: I take it this is the "slam try" sequence |pg||
nt|szalay: with aceless 11, with Qx @C I wd just say 3N, confess|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I think east made a slamtry here, that is what i heard from the explanation from west|pg||
nt|szalay: a bit starnge 3@C rebid except its forcing (doubt it) with 9 top tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: nope it works now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East and West doÂ´nt play the same system here|pg||
nt|haans: not in agrement here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would RD there onstead of 2@d, 2ndly i would definitely start with 1@h|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D show support|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|ady: west should know on the 2 lead that north has 5 clubs|pg||
nt|haans: whappen happened her|pg||
nt|frankaus: 15 2 H in pd major - pd opens - how many will stay short of game?|pg||
nt|haans: non vul yes |pg||
nt|haans: you need 50% to bid game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: my sys card is 2/1 - so it's impossible to stop before game with EW hands|pg||
nt|szalay: and ART asking bid w/o shortness|pg||
nt|daman: the axe might be unsheathed again|pg||
nt|daman: but maybe not|pg||
nt|daman: 3@C was very risky given North only promises 2|pg||
nt|chick: true, but ... he is better getting in his one bid at the first chance and then stay very quiet|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: if it was slamtry, West wd accept for sure|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he and his mother Miss Anita are BBO players|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|haans: mirrow hands not thye best|pg||
mb|d|nt|frankaus: i can handle the language of a child in hungarian but no idea about bridge terminology|pg||
nt|sybarra: this match is  2 Francy v   3 Neth. Blue|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He had seen his cards...(North)|pg||
nt|haans: diamond will win|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: sry - crashed|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: and then RD?|pg||
nt|haans: same distribution|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 2 off|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: :(|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|szalay: we will see trump play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West is Giampetro|pg||
nt|daman: down 2 |pg||
nt|haans: 2 down|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: costs nothing to put up the q |pg||
nt|szalay: as u probably know: u must leas Q first|pg||
nt|yuval10: Operator can you please insert W's name?  |pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: flat board|pg||
nt|ady: cash to clubs puts pressure on west   has to discard a heart   but still down 1|pg||
nt|haans: are they playing Magic Diamond?|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|szalay: French pair won Bonn Open Teams (Nations Cup) last year|pg||
nt|haans: lucky bidding :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: would expect 130 to be flat    but you never know|pg||
pc|s6|nt|szalay: personally I wd open West as 2N, if it starts at 20...7 controls, 4 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: i would sday just cards|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|haans: flat deal im sure|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|yuval10: Croatia is 6th, Germany yellow 13th|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|sybarra: you had another website for us |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I dont see them yet. Red vs Blue was 22-8|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|szalay: cause u can gain JTxx in South, but not in North|pg||
nt|szalay: lead|pg||
nt|daman: by passng and then doubling West was able to show his shape|pg||
nt|daman: which is helpful|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: force dummy with heart now|pg||
nt|ady: othjerwise 11 tricks|pg||
pc|cT|nt|frankaus: if !K off side even 9 may be hard to come by|pg||
nt|h_karluk: some pairs play support doubles and redoubles, a matter of style|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good tecnique - South might have all 4 trumps|pg||
nt|daman: he should have 9 cards in the pointeds|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|haans: Magic Diamond 1@S 8-12 hcp|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: tried for Q and 10 of diamonds on side  |pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|sybarra: this hand comes home delightfully |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzeg: I lost track went too fast. Both north and south kept the right ones\|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yuval10: i'm not so sure about this hand being a flat....quite possible for NS to stay away of game here|pg||
nt|haans: Croatia on 6th place|pg||
nt|yuval10: now J@c , otherwise only -1|pg||

pc|c6|nt|sybarra: over killed it...|pg||

nt|ralfwil: not the best. Win on hand and play a @s|pg||

nt|sharkey: :) - the important things Hans|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Director at the table asking Jackson about a score in the previous round|pg||
nt|haans: endplay in hearts possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: last board was 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: sorry for missing the last bid |pg||
nt|h_karluk: np|pg||
nt|szalay: I think West hand is more than 2N|pg||
nt|szalay: East, sry|pg||
nt|ady: J@C   big card in west hand   e/w can make 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: danger of 1@C being passed out|pg||
nt|szalay: I think 1@C is not an option|pg||
nt|sybarra: and stiff A of @C makes the hand easy|pg||
nt|szalay: either 2N or (semi)forcing 2@C/@D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ducking @C Queen seems better|pg||
nt|xenya: It says Round 12 here, but this is Round 10?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: round 10, yes.|pg||
nt|xenya: OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: what wd u bid over 1@C-1x-?|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|szalay: funny board|pg||
nt|haans: card to 3@S?|pg||
nt|chick: 3@S for me|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|szalay: if u go to normal games: go as fast as u can...dont give them chance to interfere|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably a preemptive @D raise coming |pg||
nt|szalay: why not 4@H with passed pd?|pg||
nt|frankaus: Ax no the best stopper in the world often better played from Qx side|pg||
nt|szalay: slam is unlikely, @H are good, so?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but unlikely to keep e/w out of 4 @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: you had the one with the picture |pg||
nt|sharkey: appears 4@S can be made - however, may have transportation problems|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    n/s may be able to stop in 2@D|pg||
nt|chick: with all their controls, can EW stay out of the @D slam?|pg||
nt|szalay: good 4@Hs fails, worse 3N COULD be make (for @H lead)|pg||
nt|xenya: i would be content with just 1@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: the website|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 12 tricks for me....previous hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Peter |pg||
nt|szalay: it was 11-14 NT|pg||
nt|daman: another partscore?   EW have the potential for a lot of tricks in @Cs|pg||
mb|3C|nt|frankaus: looks like a 30 point deck to E |pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far EW 5@c-1 and NS 4@s -1|pg||
nt|szalay: pass with 4 hcp (including a King) very dangerous|pg||
nt|ady: even 2NT opening did not get them to game|pg||
nt|sybarra: can S venture a bid,  yes he does|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s may push them a bit here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I only bid 2 @H here with a @h-suit...|pg||
nt|chick: you think S's suit is too weak?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i would've pass from E, to be honest|pg||
nt|haans: nothing perfect|pg||
nt|daman: and can make 8 tricks in NT|pg||
mb|3D|nt|haans: then we understand|pg||
mb|5C|nt|sybarra: and E with 4333....|pg||
nt|szalay: wd u bid 5@D over 1@D-4@H-?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may go 2 @H all pass |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes but that is a blog|pg||
nt|ady: n/s likely to play 2@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would even not try it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Standings after 2 rounds: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=85&Itemid=79|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: after 3 rounds actuallly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but i would rebid 1N as West|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: interesting 1NT|pg||
nt|szalay: in junior/female tourney I think to play weak nt 2/1 is an advantage|pg||
nt|haans: and a make :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 4@s is some bid by N, P has a very good support though|pg||
nt|yuval10: and now probably bid 5@s ?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Gembick's pass??|pg||
nt|haans: 1n bye North?|pg||
nt|haans: nopåe|pg||
nt|haans: not a nice bid when vul|pg||
nt|sharkey: They've landed in their best strain|pg||
nt|ady: north 2@D rebid very respectable|pg||
nt|sybarra: dout you get killed at the 2 level,  I would bid  ...sort of only chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: *doubt |pg||
nt|chick: should make this|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: ir 2 @C all pass |pg||
nt|haans: 2@D must be 6-carder|pg||
nt|ady: unfortunately may well go down |pg||
nt|pelu: I would open 2NT (20-21) - over 1@C - 1X I bid 3MT = 15-18 with long @C|pg||
nt|daman: 5@C was aggressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: why not double by South?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2254 and 15|pg||
nt|hawe45:  By several levels too weak - and only @C-lead defeats 6 @D|pg||
nt|szalay: its not true Open highest level|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think it's makeable in any way, via @c finesse|pg||
nt|haans: if opps do not play @H raise @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: best spot for n/s is clubs  but unable to get there|pg||
nt|sybarra: a @h lead might not be so pleasant |pg||
nt|ady: may well be a swing for Netherlands|pg||
nt|szalay: in 4N|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: traffic light is red pays to be conservative|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well what do I know |pg||
nt|haans: 4@H young bidding|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this time black Kings are not favorably placed|pg||
nt|daman: opposite a passed hand|pg||
pc|hT|nt|szalay: e-w gave them all the chance|pg||
nt|xenya: they might get to a hopeless slam now -- and they did|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S?  rkk ? |pg||
nt|szalay: u can beat 5@C if u play some special (lavinthal, roman) signal over A of @S|pg||
nt|haans: E dont fool me|pg||
nt|szalay: some specs asked why|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D is makeable, this contract looks unlucky|pg||
nt|szalay: I think cause at Open this kinda toy isnt so dangerous|pg||
nt|szalay: in junior/female tourney 80% or more of the field unfamiliar with weak NT sys|pg||
nt|szalay: I think no pair in the World who wd play 5-3 minor-suit game instead of 5-3 major|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true |pg||
nt|daman: who simply raised|pg||
nt|haans: they have clubs you have points so play clubs|pg||
pc|hA|nt|szalay: I think first step to trap was 1@H...after that they came deeper and deeper|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: seemed like a cuebid auction to me|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=76|pg||
nt|sybarra: this site has a picture of the beautiful facility at the White House |pg||
nt|yuval10: will make 11 now|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: it is a reburbished tennis club,  (still active tennis courts)  and a wonder bridge facility |pg||
nt|chick: no club finesse necessary |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ady: yes agree should be 6 card suit  but AQ to 6 and 2 outside aces is top weight|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think there are 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d8|nt|szalay: or by accident, only|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: and they are playing with screens |pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=31&Itemid=78   standing after round 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: long way to go |pg||
nt|frankaus: can get it home on this lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: honestly i would bid 4@d as West|pg||
nt|yuval10: the lead was one more good reason for not opening 1@h with such a poor suit |pg||
nt|haans: if only 1@S overcall is not game harder to find?|pg||
nt|xenya: i agree|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rnmalik: @D back|pg||
nt|ady: defence should prevail |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c4|nt|haans: better late than never|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: spade lay out bad for declarer|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rnmalik: the bidding sequence enabled EW to find the defence to 2@H|pg||
nt|haans: clubs ruff?|pg||
nt|frankaus: not easy to switch to 1S|pg||
nt|frankaus: @S|pg||
nt|xenya: i meant about the 1@H opening|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|szalay: 2@D was NOT xfer, was gameforcing stayman|pg||
nt|szalay: 3@D had shown a normal 6card or very good 5card suit|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|ady: cant see any other bidding possible|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am not so sure why N bid over 2 @C |pg||
nt|sybarra: where was he going?|pg||
nt|ady: this might be down 3|pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks on any lead|pg||
pc|c6|nt|frankaus: WD|pg||
nt|h_karluk: also not hard with @s T9 etc|pg||
nt|szalay: I confess I wd bid 3N directly over that|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|haans: best defense|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|animeshraj: a low h now!  and h q frm west|pg||
nt|yuval10: 9@d will enable declarer to avoid @d loser|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All results (including butlers and hand records) on www.nbbportal.nl/1003/ > 'competitie'|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|szalay: and my fate is in West's hand|pg||
pc|d9|nt|h_karluk: @d9 was indeed a slip in defense - either @hJ or small @c would work better|pg||
nt|szalay: always tough to decide between strong 4card or weaker 5card suit to lead vs. 3N|pg||
pc|d7|pc|cT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|xenya: if E has @CA and a spade honour, slam is quite good -- perhaps too much to ask for? |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: declarer claims @D7, but some debate whether it counts when @D is trump suit :)|pg||
nt|daman: down 1|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|haans: ruff|pg||
pc|s2|nt|h_karluk: well i didn't get it, sorry, why i am supposed to play 5/2 @s fit? maybe there's still a 5/4 @d fit, so i liked 1NT rebid - just keeps bidding open, i don't think promises a rose ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: garden :)|pg||
nt|pelu: Decl: better play @D first - the @h-suit was locked for defense|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: sorry did not see 2@C bid   but was presumably a transfer to 2@D |pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: nope south showed 15-17, actually they play my methods here|pg||
nt|sharkey: One more entry in W's hand - make 4! - now struggling to make 1@s....|pg||
nt|daman: doink     claim -1|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|haans: @DQ better play|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S|pg||
pc|c9|pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|pelu: the reason to pass is that game in green are only 50-50 in IMPs in red u sh be in game every time here|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c8|pc|dJ|mc|10|nt|daman: questioning their intelligence by playing it out|pg||

nt|Walddk2: lol  Everything gets doubled in the closed room; three boards in a row|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|d|nt|ralfwil: multi I suppose. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looked like minus 2, yes, I also thought 19 made 10 tricks and 20 went 3 down|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t like a multi with a 3-card suit in the other major|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Not as a rule, but 432 is not the sort of suit you are anxious to play in|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If that is penalty West can run now|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 3NT looks pretty good - the question is, what does 3@H actually mean...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Asking partner to bid NT perhaps in order to right-side it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: asking for stopper as I see it. E has passed on 2@hX|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ralfwil: But D from N looks a little bit strange for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|arigun: 3nt is best with these @h holding whatever 3@h was to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Agreements on a defence to the Multi often don't go further than one round of bidding|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It should really be takeout, and stronger than this.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Obviously, North does not know what's going on|pg||
nt|ralfwil: S has to convert to 5@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Partner does not have hearts. Did East not pass the double of 2@H? So what has he got?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: He would have corrected to 2@S if he had spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: rather a fortunate make, this|pg||

nt|szalay: it was an expensive count signal|pg||
nt|haans: slam?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Forget my 6 @D analize - I had only seen a 4-card @C at East|pg||
nt|szalay: btw Woolsey's policy is correct imho: if u have 5card suit: lead it, otherwise try to figure out pd's 5card|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: NS will make a lot of tricks here|pg||
nt|szalay: btw udca is better, cause u cant do this kinda "automatic mistake"|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|xenya: but E did bid 5@C -- seems that's what W was eager to hear|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: South could have 18+ balanced or any 5-4, passing would be a gamble|pg||
nt|yuval10: cards lie very favourable for them|pg||
nt|h_karluk: umm, slam time for NS|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sharkey: a + score is good here|pg||

nt|chick: @D7 = beer card ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_card|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like an easy game for EW here|pg||
nt|daman: now 3NT by NS unless North wants to convert|pg||
nt|haans: my votes for 2@Hx|pg||
nt|daman: why not    all contracts shouwl be doubled|pg||
nt|daman: should*|pg||
nt|daman: they can get an immediate tap|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|szalay: I think a tipical mistake to correct in junior age by coach(es): stop slam-greedy|pg||
nt|sybarra: they keep skipping the @S suit, but it is 4333   |pg||
nt|szalay: the imp score is done for GAMES, from both directions|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 21/19 and North lonely cowboy now|pg||
nt|pelu: for me 1NT or 2Nt!|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht 1NT better from north|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C not forcing|pg||
nt|szalay: that is the reason why in Hungary we tend NOT to lead 4card suit vs. 3N, rather "odd card major"|pg||
pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: and whichever suit you pick things not much easy |pg||
nt|sybarra: auction almost screams for major suit lead |pg||
nt|haans: spades not happy|pg||
nt|daman: good to see the players have some red cards in their bidding boxes|pg||
pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: 2@c now cbs- i suppose|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS past their comfort zone |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: South explained when asked that 3@c shows a good hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: I like 1 NT instead of 3@C|pg||
nt|pelu: sh for sure be a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@D will make life difficult|pg||
nt|haans: not easy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think experienced players would thank to 4@d overcall that alarmed about there's a highly distributional layout|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|haans: but what to lead|pg||

nt|sybarra: mine is participants I see |pg||
nt|szalay: in my book 3@D is NOT forcing, so dunno why West bid on|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Nort has just 5 losers, however no entry to table|pg||
nt|ady: get clubposition will  make life easy|pg||
nt|sybarra: website,  on left you can go to participants, scores etc  |pg||
nt|chick: 2N = unusual (minors in this case), but sacrificing VUL is usually dangerous, and E doesn't have enough for 4@C imo|pg||
nt|chick: and W is sucked in by E's bid to a very risky save|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West is socked in by his own 2 NT-bid - lacking 2-3 key-cards vulnerable|pg||
nt|hawe45:  sucked|pg||
nt|haans: @C) good|pg||
nt|haans: 9|pg||
nt|daman: what is their carding?|pg||
nt|haans: making it easy|pg||
pc|dA|nt|szalay: e-w has their 3rd dangerous bidding so far|pg||
nt|haans: i play 3@C as a prempt|pg||
nt|haans: many beginners believe all new suit bids are forcing even when reponers first say = have weak hand|pg||
nt|ady: diamond back best for now|pg||
nt|haans: standard for 2nt bid to be forcing nowdays|pg||
nt|daman: a spec says udca|pg||
pc|d2|nt|frankaus: put me down as a pass with Wests hand - aceless 4333 even with 14 i would pass|pg||
nt|szalay: double by South?|pg||
nt|ady: 2 spades and a club it seems|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i play as jump rebid|pg||
nt|haans: clubsa clubs and more clubs|pg||
pc|d6|nt|h_karluk: and maybe that was a good reason to begin with a convention - the F******y|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Even green against red it is doubtful|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcoms Szalay |pg||
nt|ady: needs to cash club now|pg||
nt|szalay: normal bidding, normal contract, easy make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@h also works - natural|pg||
nt|yuval10: with some overtricks|pg||
nt|pelu: Howard 8Australia) after same start bid 1Nt in N|pg||
nt|szalay: Brigitta became a bit pessimistic abroad|pg||
nt|szalay: so here @S lead for us...the best one|pg||
nt|szalay: @D fulfills it|pg||
nt|szalay: as bridgeplayer I wd like to watch @S lerad...as Hungarian @D:)|pg||
nt|szalay: lead|pg||
nt|daman: that was not a great switch|pg||
nt|haans: @C) = lavinthal|pg||
nt|haans: 9|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: Jacco's first web site, you can see the beautiful facility |pg||
nt|szalay: he has 2 aces, pd had shown values, they bypassed 3n...SO|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good lead|pg||
nt|szalay: odd card major, u know:)|pg||
nt|szalay: but are few exceptions what I dont tell u know...we need some secret weapons:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: so is @H in E:)|pg||
nt|szalay: unbid oddcard major, to be specific|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ok|pg||
nt|yuval10: red suit lead will give declarer his 9th trick, not that he can't develope one in @s anyway...|pg||
pc|d8|nt|haans: with 4-2 draw trumfs and play nt|pg||
nt|chick: as a kib points out, E may want to double 4@S as well|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzeg: I made the classic mistake 4 and A|pg||
nt|szalay: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to be careful now not to lose a @S |pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi and welcome|pg||
nt|haans: have x for mopre cards|pg||
nt|pelu: nu lead can defeat 3Nt - 3!X then u set up 3 @D-tricks = 9|pg||
nt|ady: with hearts 4-4  heart lead would not beat the contract  defence take 3 hearts and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Facing a vulnerable 2 NT, East can only see 3 losers|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: depends agreements just use 2@d or 2@h, and make things easier|pg||
nt|szalay: btw @H beats it as well|pg||
nt|rnmalik: It makes only on @D lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I mean as the cards are|pg||
nt|szalay: Hope can lead @S back, cause sure partner has T: otherwise declarer wd play small from dummy, probably|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Hop asking questions about possible distribution|pg||
nt|szalay: some spec suggested @C lead is ok as well: to be honest I dont lead opps suit from Txx...NEVER|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: of declarer's hand|pg||
nt|szalay: declerer could have 4card @S|pg||
nt|szalay: his bid just denies 4card @H|pg||
pc|d9|nt|szalay: to bid games, take tricks...and double games when they r in vuln and we see the chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is a reburbished tennis club (still active tennis courts) and quite a terrific bridge facility also |pg||
nt|haans: many  mean 3n to show two cards in opening suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: now only @h will limit declarer to 10|pg||
nt|daman: tempo is everything|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|h_karluk: 11-15 5@h+4@s stuff|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: made a mistake when correcting the first score|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: was 1 off|pg||
pc|dT|nt|yuval10: otherwise 12 tricks|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ady: this not definately making from south's point of view|pg||
nt|ady: if south plays K@H now then will be much better placed|pg||
nt|szalay: do u see any reason for small @D?|pg||
nt|szalay: except blocking suit?|pg||
nt|szalay: and to give fals impression to pd?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West might refret the small @D - but we do not know their methods|pg||
nt|szalay: I am informed Hungarian defender started @S as well|pg||
nt|szalay: he learnt his lesson well, wd:)|pg||
nt|szalay: I believe to lead small from Qx is technically bad|pg||
nt|szalay: when dummy has 76xx|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I agree adds to confusion for the P|pg||
nt|szalay: small @D back wd be a punishment...|pg||
nt|szalay: but:|pg||
nt|szalay: who has J of @S?|pg||
nt|szalay: surely West|pg||
nt|szalay: otherwise declarer wd play small, not Q|pg||
nt|szalay: at trick 1|pg||

nt|pelu: yes: @Sk - @s ruff - @c to A and @S ruff|pg||
nt|haans: to strong for flannery|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: K@S   spade ruff   then trump back and another spade ruff|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Now, I think|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I imagine 3@H is a weak raise?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Some specs seem to be unfamiliar with West's 2@H bid. The convention is called Michaels' Cue Bid and shows at least 5-5 in the other major and an unspecified minor|pg||
nt|ralfwil: You got the right word for it Liz -weak rise:)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: One should support partner's 5-5 to the limit - he wll have to bid 4@S next time, so why not now?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|arigun: @hQJ is very bad holding i understand but 3@s is still too conservative i think|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But there is also a risk involves - opps bid their game on adaptation|pg||

nt|h_karluk: esp when u r a passed hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, 2@c is invitational |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i agree with 3@c rebid, invite or better, i can live with that 5 losers, no matter entry to table, i know no need to cry when they sets, favorable vuln was another tempting factor|pg||
nt|haans: right u r|pg||
nt|haans: not bad|pg||
nt|pelu: west has a 5 loser-hand - and his pd has 0 tricks for him! :(|pg||
nt|szalay: rehi|pg||
nt|ady: west may open some sort of weak 2|pg||
nt|daman: they should gain at least 3 IMPs    800 was there for the taking|pg||
nt|haans: @C9 acceptable of play low enc|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: so George, which contract will we end up (doubled) in now?|pg||
nt|daman: @D Ace was fatal|pg||
nt|daman: hhrrrmmmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: commentators curse strikes immediatly:(|pg||
nt|ady: re|pg||
nt|szalay: but East knew J of @S for sure|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H?|pg||
nt|daman: no doubled contracts this time|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yuval10: if he wasn't passed hand then 2@d would've been GF|pg||
mb|1S|nt|szalay: in that case I wd go out for water, to refresh myself|pg||
nt|ady: an easy 3NT  played by south|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|sharkey: E has the "perfect" Dbl hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 23-17 this time, another interesting board|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: they even played after the claim..|pg||
nt|szalay: Frenchmen are very conservative with 4card other major|pg||
nt|ady: at least 10 tricks in hearts for e/w|pg||
nt|ady: west decided not to open|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Also, yes|pg||
nt|szalay: logic is more important than defence agreements|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 4@s?|pg||
nt|daman: I might have to eat my words :)|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rnmalik: can they make 6@D|pg||
mb|3S|nt|h_karluk: uh oh. 1@s ? hmmm :)|pg||
nt|pelu: his problem was the 4 card @s|pg||
nt|ady: west wasting no time  4@D  is for hearts|pg||
nt|szalay: I agree with xfer to 4@H: IF we have weak 6card and strong 4card major, kinda stayman is preferred|pg||
nt|szalay: in Hungary we had a 1st class teacher/player in 60s, called Lajos Widder|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2NT in N for minor|pg||
nt|szalay: his favourite proverb was: "I hate maths...only important thing is: all players has 13 cards and all color has 13"|pg||
nt|daman: I must admit    I would have bid 2@H with the West hand|pg||
nt|haans: both makes|pg||
nt|daman: 1@S seemed timid|pg||
nt|chick: too strong for Michaels|pg||
nt|daman: no way|pg||
nt|chick: 1@S, then 2@D shows the hand much better|pg||
nt|haans: best is 5@H now|pg||
nt|daman: classic Michaels|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sharkey: 3 NT|pg||
mb|4S|nt|szalay: terrible slam, imho|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a @C can be pitched on @S but they dont know:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to play 2 @H's here|pg||
nt|szalay: in Hungary we play Michaels a bit different way than World do|pg||
nt|szalay: NOT weak or strong, rather "at least inv values, no upper limit"|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: dont they play Drury?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: During the white house juniors very nice weather last few years|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Dennis Bilde had his moment on the first board. now 1 highpoint average over 3|pg||
nt|haans: best game 3nt but ...|pg||
nt|szalay: Lazar could NOT bid 3@D as P/C, cause its inv with @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: water? - do u know what fish do in water :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: those hands are usually easy to bid :)|pg||
nt|ady: natural    should have had a 5th club|pg||
nt|haans: no way to show @D :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: how about pass :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: he already had 3@c in his hand..|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: practically|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - E/W need a quiet board|pg||
nt|szalay: I think South's hand is close to 2N, imho|pg||
nt|daman: hard to bid 2@D over 3@H|pg||
nt|chick: Michaels is a preemptive bid, he does not need to preempt|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H usually no defensive tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: kibs asking 6@D      can make    but bad contract  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: no way|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: but last moment rethink :P|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - Jacks are doubtful values and 3-3-3-4|pg||
nt|daman: michaels is a descriptive bid    doesn't have to be preemptive at all|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: what a sad way to end a bidding|pg||
pc|h5|nt|szalay: I think 9 hcp with ruffing values is more than regular 10 hcp|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  2nd negative|pg||
nt|pelu: great bid!|pg||
nt|haans: clubs lead ?|pg||
nt|szalay: I think 6@C is very optimistic, especially in all white|pg||
nt|szalay: all white is NOT a position where u need be greedy|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|chick: that's the normal way to play it ... preemptive or 18+ ... but of course you can do as you like :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|szalay: likely 11 tricks, next one|pg||
nt|ady: trump switch  will hold to 10|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rnmalik: agree was an observation|pg||
nt|pelu: 9½ out of 10 will lead @S|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|pelu: ½ lead @d! :)|pg||
nt|ady: natrual spade lead 9 tricks    this likely to be a swing for Australia|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All results (including butlers and hand records) at www.nbbportal.nl/1003/ > 'competitie'|pg||
nt|szalay: r u sure?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No intermediats|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N found no defense to 5@H and has settled for -2 as we see|pg||
nt|chick: I wonder what the difference between that sequence and 1N 3N is|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 3NT has 9 tricks via 3@s , 2@h, 2@d and 2@c|pg||
nt|xenya: this rates to make  think|pg||
nt|haans: my guess 2@S 2nt replacement|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, Hans|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|szalay: important thing after bad boards: leave table for a while and reconnect:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: All Israels I know play drury, maybe west didnt think his hand was good enough\|pg||
nt|ady: club lead will need spades 3-3 to pitch losing club   and heart lead will need king well placed|pg||
nt|sybarra: wrongsided this one|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3nt will make with the   @HJshort|pg||
nt|pelu: no|pg||
nt|szalay: trump LEAD does it|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   meant trump lead|pg||
nt|szalay: cause North could lead 2nd one|pg||
nt|szalay: I think to lead trump is close to suiced from South's seat|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and no DBL|pg||
nt|szalay: of course, it could make for 3-3 @S, but: in that case 5@HX is at least 500, can be 800|pg||
nt|szalay: I dont like to save|pg||
nt|szalay: I like when WE score|pg||
nt|haans: direct 5@H more angry|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|haans: weak responder 2 jacks|pg||
nt|haans: easy to raise @D|pg||
nt|xenya: this may be a swing as pass by W over 1N is a fair option|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|xenya: not for juniors perhaps though|pg||
nt|daman: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/MichaelsCuebid.html|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzeg: kleine kamer|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think an imaginary problem there : say east has AQ96-KT983-7-J42, okay guys, would bid 1@h or still double over 1@d? my opinion : if East wld X with that  hand then 2@d cue by W ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: gr8 :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Probably take @C finesse and end up with 11 tricks|pg||
nt|szalay: and his pd has strong hand: give her the last decision:)|pg||
nt|haans: they have a diamond loser|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|daman: it's all in there|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzeg: oops that was personal|pg||
nt|ady: clubs blocked fortunately|pg||
nt|sybarra: so you get lucky sometimes |pg||
nt|ady: east condiering unblocking  hoping 10@C with west|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with that junk even they show me full hands i could not dare to land 3@c|pg||
nt|haans: @CJ not cover not two entries to dummy|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chick: lack of intermediates is what I see as the big problem -- half of S's hand is 5 or below|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|VugraphPl1: http://michzimny.pl/bridge/2010/pila/gp.html|pg||
nt|ady: back to 10 maybe|pg||
nt|szalay: why @D?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: good play that unforunately gets no reward|pg||
nt|sybarra: valiant try |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: both north and south complimented east|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wud bid 1@H|pg||
nt|haans: me 2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  North now asks himself: WHY did I take that trick?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, declarer can't set up the long suit, so he should take Yuval's line|pg||
nt|xenya: and that's what he is doing it seems|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|szalay: its risky|pg||
nt|szalay: @C/@S is sure exit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: flat board|pg||
nt|szalay: when we need just 1 trick to set: lead safe is a basic rule|pg||
nt|szalay: just interchange Q and J of @D why was it terrible try|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so that matters, 1@h just F1 fine|pg||
nt|haans: but how to get it|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h7|nt|sharkey: Think better let @C9 run as N pegged with @CA|pg||
nt|haans: or transfer bids|pg||
nt|haans: let overcaller lead :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: next...|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I can't claim before they do|pg||
nt|pelu: we have a real top-match on here: France 1 = No 2 (126 VP after 6 matches) and NL Blue No 3 (113)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|szalay: after this bidding trump lead is nearly automatic, imho|pg||
pc|s9|nt|haans: had no reason to play @CK|pg||
nt|haans: 1 clubs loser deep finesse|pg||
pc|s8|nt|chick: and I quote:  " the accepted point count should be between 5 high card points and 11 high card points, although the strength is again a matter of the partnership agreement."|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|szalay: but Aces ar Aces:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But you will find many 15/16 HCP-hands, who are stronger|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h3|pc|d2|nt|frankaus: another hand where after pd opens i would find it hard to stay out of game|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|xenya: the defence can't establish enought tricks, so declarer can develop slow tricks at his leisure|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|chick: so if you want to argue that he had a good 11, I suppose you can consider you win this debate, but I still think it was too strong :)|pg||
nt|daman: By unfavorable vulnerability, the minimum high card points should be somewhat higher and stronger in honors.|pg||

nt|h_karluk:  3 S had 0, now E has 1|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20 |pg||

nt|daman: duh|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzeg: south had 1 on 4 aswell and 2 on 2|pg||
mb|3S|nt|h_karluk: pass by E?|pg||
nt|haans: agree with that pass|pg||
nt|szalay: btw I wd bid 3N immediately here: dont give them chance for right lead |pg||
nt|szalay: slam is very unlikely|pg||
nt|ady: n/s haved a choice   5@C  or 3NT     3NT scores better|pg||
nt|pelu: the 8. @C is the key-card for direct 3Nt - u dont need an H in @C from pd|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S-lead might bring 480|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No...|pg||
nt|szalay: it requires a perfect sys and silent opps to bid it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So am I - no double is OK|pg||
nt|szalay: 6+5+2=13|pg||
nt|haans: all jumps are not weak :)|pg||
nt|daman: on with the show|pg||
mb|4H|nt|haans: easy to get -800|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: e/w have 9 tricks in spades as they lay|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, if 4@s is exclusion |pg||
nt|szalay: bid 6 or 7 depends on answer|pg||
nt|sharkey: Wonder if S knows what to do with all the points  - he'll probably drop stiff @SK to maje 4@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: *make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and that's 10 boards sets, presumably predealt hands|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think that's wild|pg||
nt|sharkey: S may raise...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think i wld bid 3@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: he did, west goes into the tank now|pg||
nt|haans: west  do not promise @SK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i dislike 3@d with 16 there|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - Vul at IMPs think it's right|pg||
nt|pelu: 2Nt = I can help in @c|pg||
nt|pelu: what can S bid now ? X for @S-stop?|pg||
nt|ady: not sure it right to settle for 3NT  switch K@D with A! north and west  then 6@C makes and 3NT down 1|pg||
nt|ady: k@D   and A@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: double on 2@S? Would  anybody else do that?|pg||
nt|ady: no   |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: maybe my question also gives my opinion :)|pg||
nt|pelu: no X - in my book 5-card - or very strong 4-card suit - u can exp that pd bid 4@S over 3NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: Wud you pass and hope they land in NT?|pg||

nt|haans: but give east a @D ruff then...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now i pass to 4@d|pg||
nt|sharkey: After 1 NT opening West likely to be on lead anyway|pg||
nt|haans: and they are non vul|pg||
nt|pelu: I am with u Tim|pg||
nt|szalay: 2N: 14+, bal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - back to my first view|pg||
nt|szalay: 2@D was nat and GF|pg||
nt|xenya: NS might get in trouble now|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@d by N perhaps?|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H = strong hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  pass perhaps?|pg||
nt|xenya: but just might -- N can rebid @Ds and S should pass|pg||
nt|haans: intermediate?|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: to stay at the table is a bad habit..I think no kinda rule in bridge|pg||
nt|szalay: if North says 3@D exclusion RKC could help...and later a grand slamtry:|pg||
nt|haans: normal opening bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: no, 2@h is weak, but with partner who passed it can still be strongish|pg||
nt|haans: ok ok|pg||
pc|h4|nt|haans: 2@H help me now|pg||
nt|ady: west trying to scramble to a better spot|pg||
nt|szalay: North wd accept with source of tricks, for sure|pg||

pc|h7|nt|VugraphPl1: sorry|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like a misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@D is crazy ....|pg||

pc|hA|nt|sharkey: West gets whathe asked for|pg||
nt|davidb: hi good evening|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just curiosity, when someone would intervene?|pg||
nt|szalay: 4@D was optional RKC|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|szalay: std polish lead: low from doubleton|pg||
nt|ady: looks like down 1|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it will turn on the right side for NS|pg||
nt|h_karluk: bid 6 make 7 now, bid 7 go down 1 when @h K fails in a different layout|pg||
nt|daman: I have been told it is 9-13|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yuval10: 4NT probably interpreted as 1430 by S|pg||
nt|sybarra: awkwardly,  but "we" landed |pg||

nt|szalay: but he has 0:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: 4m for me only as invite to 5|pg||
nt|haans: as good as 1nt ruffing @D|pg||

pc|sA|nt|ady: should east have removed to 2@S  with 3 in each?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think many would double to show equal strength|pg||
nt|haans: you win some lose some|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to play for the drop in @H's |pg||

nt|szalay: 4@S is 500|pg||
nt|szalay: 4@Sx|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Best game here 3 NT, but difficult to reach|pg||
nt|pelu: 11 tricks in 4@H - coffee time :)|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt (no clubs lead)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: time to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|szalay: probably 4@S silences everyone|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|szalay: leave table..and slower play...|pg||
nt|xenya: much better to play @Ds up twice from W|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cold 4@s|pg||
nt|haans: bid better than x|pg||
nt|haans: easy slam here|pg||
nt|pelu: play to one goal - but Australia No 4 and NL-21 No 22 in the standing, so natural|pg||
nt|h_karluk: my guess EW would buy to 2/3 @s|pg||
nt|szalay: may be 3@S yet|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 4@s for me with N's cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: impossible to play with that speed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hmm, 4 cards M|pg||
nt|szalay: but a lot better if they dont lead @D|pg||
nt|haans: 18-19 balanced hand (italian style)|pg||
mb|2S!|an|transfer to 2nt|nt|h_karluk: 3@s super accept i expect by E|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Cold with 4 losers...|pg||
nt|haans: stronger than 3@C|pg||
nt|ady: grand      not wasy to locate |pg||
nt|pelu: close to a 2@C-opening - 2½ loser|pg||
nt|ady: yes   should be routine|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh,  I would probably also open 2nt but looking at all 4 hands this will not be a success|pg||
nt|daman: if South had led the @H K    he could have switched to a @D after seeing dummy     the @H K is a standard lead in that situation      no guarantee to beat 4@S though since @Ds are ...|pg||
nt|daman: ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: preemts|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|sybarra: S can "see" no hts in N |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: but do you X|pg||
nt|sybarra: not so sure bidding 5 @D in tempo might not get them to 5 @H  but we will never know |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@S and @CJ and cross ruff possible|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now makes 3NT|pg||
nt|szalay: I dont use "congrats" in this case:) lucky is more normal:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT on a @D lead|pg||
nt|haans: good q to all what did double mean? lead dummy or own suit|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|sharkey: West held off after last hand... - not unexpected|pg||
nt|h_karluk: weird, W declined the invitation|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S set with @D shift|pg||
nt|haans: missin game not junior style :) sort of|pg||
nt|haans: you needed some thing like Blue clubs to find slam|pg||
nt|yuval10: once again NS will make their contract, probably with an overtrick|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: What wd u lead from T962?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 10 |pg||
nt|szalay: I think either 6 or 2 (depends on your methods)|pg||
nt|szalay: T is not a honour:)|pg||
nt|szalay: u can waste interior cards that way...watch it now...|pg||
nt|xenya: on 1, the Poles in the other room wound up in 4@H -- strange contract. 11 imps to Israel|pg||
nt|szalay: with appropriate entries declaler could have 4 tricks now|pg||
nt|szalay: it looks another good board for Dutch 2suiter methods|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|szalay: cant take 10 tricks, imho|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @s Qj drops, wow|pg||
nt|haans: naturally or bid it :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: meanwhile that's a mirror hand|pg||
nt|daman: 3-3   and West can pitch a @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D!|nt|h_karluk: i was polite - meant 'congrats - with murder in my heart' :)|pg||
nt|chick: I think the usual meaning of the double is lead my suit, but if both have bid a suit, it's lead the non-normal one|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  @D better than @C ib South|pg||
nt|hawe45:  in|pg||
nt|haans: must play one more @H psychic|pg||
nt|szalay: -200 is a bargain here|pg||
mb|4H|nt|szalay: but South thought more undertricks, I believe|pg||
nt|ady: acw  king ace and those trumps  seems double right|pg||
nt|szalay: but he must switch to trump|pg||
nt|szalay: North count helped a lot|pg||
nt|ady: yes agree|pg||
nt|sybarra: pickling his own suit however |pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  No Lavinthal this @C 8...!|pg||
nt|chick: not me, I would open 1@D and rebid 2N ... I think HCP is an excellent indication of NT values, and I stretch of the standard HCP only with a strong source of extra tricks|pg||
nt|haans: you did last time we played 3ntxx|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C puppet i presume|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 3NT would've been easier here|pg||
nt|szalay: when longer trump could be tapped, moysian (4-3) fit isnt so good|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it looks like declarer can still manage|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - E doesn't have any useful pitch on @H10|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 I mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: why not 3N over 2?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for our kibitzers let me try to explain : same shape at EW|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on @C switch|pg||
nt|szalay: I have heard same contract in OR|pg||
nt|szalay: I have a spy:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Your interest well appreciated your match:)|pg||
nt|szalay: bidding was: 2@H-X-4@H-4@S|pg||
nt|szalay: dunno why not doubled by North|pg||
nt|szalay: I am Hungarian, my Godmother was Dutch...what I need more?:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes on that bidding X possible|pg||
nt|haans: my suit 2 down|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes|pg||
nt|daman: this was a neat auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: montanari very relieved franchi has @h's|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: but he's the kind of guy to joke around|pg||
nt|haans: had bid 3@C myself (showing 4 spades)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: tap dummy is ok |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think  3@c was NF there|pg||
nt|rnmalik: mixed feelings:)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|h_karluk: i think coaches never allow psyches in junior level|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|xenya: E's double is beyond my understanding|pg||
nt|daman: Turley picked up 5 IMPs on Board 2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|szalay: from T9xy I wd lead T/9 only if X=8|pg||
nt|xenya: this doesn't look rosy for declarer|pg||

nt|daman: Turkey*|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1|pg||
nt|haans: (2@D-3@C)|pg||

nt|chick: or Turkiye :)|pg||
nt|daman: :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|szalay: not, xruff is coming|pg||
nt|ady: I think will make 8 trump tricks and 2 spades   needed to play a trump|pg||
nt|szalay: what was South's plan?|pg||
nt|haans: or Sweden or ...|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|yuval10: he was affraid of stoppers in the red suit |pg||

nt|szalay: ouch...|pg||
nt|sybarra: oops|pg||
nt|szalay: he was optimistic last time, became pessimistic now?:)|pg||
nt|davidb: agressive  juniors bidding . W  has an easy pass over 3H |pg||
nt|daman: this was not a painful switch|pg||
nt|haans: or Romex|pg||
nt|daman: gave up the suit|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|szalay: it wont make, I think...especially when declarer ate his @D entry|pg||
nt|haans: do they listen to coaches|pg||
nt|haans: spade finesse|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yuval10: suits even|pg||
nt|szalay: its not 7HCP's duty|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: or drop|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|ady: what was west's plan|pg||
nt|haans: 2 defensive trick :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: might mean it as sort of a responsive....|pg||
nt|daman: a pedestrian @C continuation seems best|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sharkey: so off 1|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|sybarra: Koike, did not realize his blessing |pg||
nt|haans: why did North not play the @SJ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: contract impossible to make|pg||
pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: set stone orders :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|szalay: neither of them realized that someone leads a trump, declarer's 2 trump at most 1 trick|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: now losing spade trick|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|szalay: easy 2 off, next one, pls|pg||
nt|frankaus: my view is that texas is an anacronistic agreement - now superceeded|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|xenya: well defended for 2 down|pg||

nt|szalay: no|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|szalay: partner has  half of teh deck|pg||

nt|h_karluk: 20-20 1st time there|pg||

nt|chick: of his own hand |pg||
nt|chick: sometimes it works :)|pg||

mb|1C|nt|h_karluk: 24-16 again partscore|pg||
mb|1D|nt|szalay: 5431 is a good treatment|pg||
nt|szalay: Poles invented 5431-convention|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East will welcome a @S-opening + do.-support|pg||
nt|haans: not 2 aces K = 1 contraol Ace 2|pg||
nt|haans: all may be in @D'|pg||
nt|sybarra: but at imps,  maybe not always prudent |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I always find the making lead when my partner doubles on principle :(|pg||
nt|xenya: yes perhaps it means: pd, we have more points than they -- but so what?|pg||
nt|daman: what would we bid with the South hand?  1NT?|pg||
nt|chick: giving juniors too many slam hands can result in bids at the 8 level :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|szalay: jump to 3M means: stiff major, 3card other major|pg||
nt|szalay: the weak nt|pg||
nt|szalay: East hand is interesting|pg||
nt|szalay: I wd rather dbl first and bid @S thereafter|pg||
mb|d!|nt|szalay: (no entry back after ruffing finesse)|pg||
nt|szalay: easy 4@H/3N by E-W|pg||
nt|haans: best is 5@C/D|pg||
nt|yuval10: the favourable lie of the cards here mean that NS can make 12 tricks in both minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: especially usefull if u open 1N with 5card M|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: true but transfer then bid game what do u loose?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 1N then 2@s good, so you can play direct 2@s raise 8-10|pg||
nt|haans: x with void can be costly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@c rebid then 2@s rebid, so all pass would also be nice|pg||
nt|szalay: In my book REOPENING 2@H shows kinda hand, what West has|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT is the best spot|pg||
nt|szalay: so NO W2 in balancing seat|pg||
nt|daman: the double is probably t/o for the majors?    it was alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes|pg||
nt|daman: S should pull|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: routin 3N is coming|pg||
nt|szalay: so here 1N-3@H-4@S|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6@S as they lay|pg||
nt|pelu: back - with cofee :)|pg||
nt|szalay: but its close decision, anyway|pg||
nt|szalay: I wd bid my suit if its NOT the highest ranking one|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
pc|d2|nt|szalay: if no trump lead/switch: he will ruff a @D|pg||
nt|frankaus: now is X pen?|pg||
nt|szalay: "who has the @Ss, has the power"|pg||
nt|szalay: as Lenin said 93 years ago|pg||
nt|szalay: (sadly he used "sowiets" instead of @s..he could play bridge|pg||
nt|szalay: could not|pg||
nt|szalay: btw did u know our games hero, Culbertson left Russia after Revoultion?|pg||
nt|szalay: his father was a civil engineer there|pg||
nt|haans: xenya we have all been there|pg||
nt|haans: 1@C mbs did cost this time|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: so 2 @S transfer to minor? |pg||
nt|szalay: but they wont bid with missing ace and trump queen|pg||
nt|pelu: over 4@C and no @D-cue West would know|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@H is a very poor game. It requires more than the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|haans: poerknight: yea but if u hear 4 controls and see 3 kings in ur hand it can only be 2 aces and riye he is|pg||
nt|pelu: so NL on the scoreboard|pg||
pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: i think passive trump lead auto there|pg||
nt|szalay: best defence is: cash 3 winners and @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - West should know pd's loaded; however, with 4 HCP too weak|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and maybe @h3 would give a better idea - say 3/5 leads thoroughout in sys card|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i did not get that 2@h|pg||
nt|chick: in balance seat, 2@H should show good 6 hearts and opening hand|pg||
nt|daman: I think the opps get their 7 before he gets his 7|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|szalay: in my book that is a slamtry in M, balanced|pg||
nt|szalay: to lose balanced slamtry with 6bagger is gap, anyway|pg||
nt|yuval10: now declarer can play A and Q@c discarding @s|pg||
nt|szalay: no ruffing finesse is suggested|pg||
nt|szalay: no 100% line, and could be lead from doubleton, but that is the best line, imho|pg||
nt|h_karluk: because you have 2 aces and 3 times trumps, whenever you are in can easily work to cut a ruff|pg||
nt|haans: many do not pen until opps reach game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: while found 5/2 @s fit why he got risk , hard question to reply|pg||
nt|davidb: easy  X  by N  -Ns  at least 6 trumps & more points|pg||
nt|haans: pass on 1nt = balanced hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: F1N not in sys?|pg||
nt|szalay: back...its the most boring set so far|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: Poland got the 11 imps back quickly, when they stopped in game on 2 (6@H was the contract here) |pg||
nt|ady: north minimum  lacking aces   and wasted K@H  definately should settle for game|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk4: Even on that lead, and with hearts 3-2, it can't make|pg||
nt|chick: there is no such thing as a preempt when opps have already quit bidding :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Chick |pg||
nt|hawe45:  The 800 was only 500 in OR - same contract, and same 2 NT from West|pg||
nt|xenya: that's true, Hans|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT is a bad contract but can be made|pg||
nt|yuval10: by double finessing the @d's|pg||
nt|haans: a make if no @D loser|pg||
nt|daman: if he doesn't cover   he might only get 5|pg||
pc|d5|nt|szalay: I think South could bid 4@H with 3 aces over 3@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that would help East to see South has only a @h card|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|szalay: imagine North has spade Q instead of K of @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: so -1 here|pg||

nt|szalay: do u use different shuffling machine there?|pg||

mb|d|mb|5C|nt|h_karluk: you know sometimes even a nickel is important :)|pg||

nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|szalay: easy looking 4@H...but: gotta play carefully cause of bad trump break|pg||
nt|szalay: 6@S is makes yet|pg||
nt|szalay: but that is really terrible|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and 6@C|pg||
nt|szalay: personally I wd bid 6@C as south, P/C|pg||
nt|haans: you have to fight hard for every hand|pg||
mb|5S|nt|h_karluk: q : x or 2N or 2@d?|pg||

nt|haans: Tekir you have no pass notes?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: she has gotten the hang of things|pg||

mb|6S|nt|szalay: dont see other option than 3N now by North|pg||
nt|haans: urrk|pg||
nt|daman: sorry    she|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: connection was rather slow|pg||
nt|szalay: personally my preference list by Sout over 1@H is:|pg||
nt|szalay: pass, 1N....period....2@C|pg||
nt|haans: suprised they do not play trf here|pg||
nt|sharkey: if it's a "coulda" - probably too close to x at IMPs|pg||
nt|ady: west overcall on 4 card suit understandable|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our next match (and last today) in about 40 minutes: Norway vs Italy|pg||
nt|haans: South endbid :)|pg||
nt|szalay: with likely plus for n-s, anyway|pg||
nt|pelu: easy 1@s - u dont X on 5 card major exp u are very strong|pg||
nt|rnmalik: X must with this hand|pg||
nt|szalay: in this case often happens save over 7@C:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why not 5 NT by South - pick a minor - and 6 @C =  MY suit|pg||
nt|chick: conservative?  juniors?  they are fearless!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|szalay: do u see any reason not to pass 2@H?|pg||
nt|szalay: or a strength showing double is an option yet|pg||
nt|xenya: on 3, where Israel bid up to 5@D here, the Poles in the other room reached an even worse contract -- 3N -- 3 off and 3 imps to Israel |pg||
nt|h_karluk: in new year teams, we were tied 42-42, then 3 more extension boards, again tied, and last board just won with 1 IMP |pg||
nt|szalay: personally I wd bid 3N over 2N|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: there's you slam|pg||
pc|cK|nt|VugraphPl1: last board   thanks all |pg||
nt|daman: -1|pg||
nt|haans: i think 6@S was insulting p|pg||
nt|daman: unless they completely misdefend|pg||
pc|c9|nt|VugraphPl1: http://michzimny.pl/bridge/2010/pila/gp.html|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D by S?|pg||
nt|xenya: what do you think about N's double?|pg||
nt|frankaus: X do something sensible is a reasonable call |pg||
nt|sybarra: agressive?|pg||
nt|szalay: its normal, imho|pg||
nt|xenya: is it penalty?|pg||
nt|szalay: especially if u play sound overcalls..and send greetings to East for reopen|pg||
nt|xenya: penalty-orinted i should say|pg||
nt|szalay: 8-10, bid sthg, imho|pg||
nt|szalay: I doubt it|pg||
nt|frankaus: no here  - opps bid & raise  X = t/o|pg||
nt|szalay: btw if South passes and North bids @C a BIT easier, but isnt easy yet|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but makes with a lucky @d hook|pg||
nt|szalay: they play: minor ALWAYS P/C|pg||
nt|szalay: and NT means: I have a suit|pg||
nt|haans: assume 3nt show 5 @H puppet variation|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting 3N rebid: partner, i want to be in 3N even if you have 4 hearts? |pg||
nt|yuval10: there are no difficulties here with the play|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H = no major |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 3NT showing hearts, yes|pg||
nt|xenya: ah i see|pg||
nt|chick: actually, most of the interest in these hands has been the bidding|pg||
nt|haans: fiver|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|szalay: I think North can double 4@S quite confidently|pg||
nt|szalay: or 3N yet..J9xxx in 1 suit, AK9x in other|pg||
nt|pelu: @D now will set up a ruff for East|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|szalay: I dont like to play lowlevel dbls as penalty|pg||
nt|xenya: so it was for minors|pg||
nt|szalay: good point, Frank|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Lotan put the Hoody of the sweater on his head after being doubled|pg||
nt|szalay: to lead stiff in pds suit is tempting|pg||
nt|pelu: the set look boring - but in almost all matches we have seen strang mistakes that cist - here good bridge|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|haans: what did x mean?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Takeout?|pg||
nt|haans: their are at least 3 variation of puppet so i refuse to play any online|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am hairless and fearless, they are supposed to have fresh and strong hairs :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hawe45:  E/W got the chance...|pg||
nt|sharkey: this match could be a blowout|pg||
nt|haans: can East ever have 4 spades|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - we all know, what England RED means - after this battle|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: typical agressive junior double|pg||
nt|frankaus: t/o do something sensible|pg||
nt|haans: many bid 1@S to show five x to show 4 |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@h+4@c+1@s + 5@d are his tricks|pg||
nt|szalay: with 28-29 hcp 3N generally is safer in 2 balanced hands, cause no bad trump break|pg||
nt|chick: 3@C may be checkback|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hawe45:  Dangerous double - no defence against 4 @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: I like Dbl instead of 2@S - EW lost the whole 1 level thus they end up in this hopeless contract|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But played by South, 3 NT is percect - NOT by North|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|frankaus: if u beat it 1 - what have u gained  - canu really expect to beat it 2 or more?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he leads, and has @d A, planned after @s A knocked out wld score many tricks to set|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|szalay: not to play Q was a clear error, imho|pg||
nt|szalay: ruff and trump now|pg||
nt|drorp: hashavti ze helgemo hamavrik mibenehem|pg||
nt|ady: bold action from east     found partner with a useful hand including 4 clubs|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hawe45:  To me, this is the 3rd best lead from the East-hand|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s4|nt|szalay: its strange to me that no one plays 3@C as puppet to 3@D: in that case u can stop in 3@D (crucial if u respond 1M with longer @Ds)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Only @H is worse|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hawe45:  Well done - Jack = @D|pg||

nt|szalay: N-S deserved their fate|pg||
nt|szalay: oops|pg||
pc|c2|nt|szalay: North was in driving seat at trick 2|pg||
nt|szalay: he forget to play @D early...it wasnt so bad: after @C lead he fears of @C ruff...not now|pg||
nt|daman: the only way to make this is the Sominex Coup    take 20 minutes to play the hand...put the opps to sleep....and make a false claim which they accept|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s3|nt|sharkey: Indeed - things are going the Danes' way|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West can play the @H 3 to the 4...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Rare also|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|szalay: he MUST solve it with xxxx trumps|pg||
nt|yuval10: and no X|pg||
pc|hA|nt|szalay: if we have small trumps, ruff and lead trumps generally the best move|pg||

nt|haans: 30 min to next session|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: in my humble opinion this level of the play is not good at U20 yet|pg||
nt|frankaus: -470 is not a good number on a scoresheet|pg||

nt|ady: whoever plays likely to go down|pg||
nt|yuval10: very quick session it was|pg||
nt|pelu: a @d-lead set up @DJ to discard for a major-loser|pg||
nt|ady: must have slipped in defence to let 3@C through|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, i do not see any reason to begin with 3@c at 1st seat|pg||
nt|pelu: but defense could still kill @dJ by ruff|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead may set up J@D  but that can beruffed out when west wins ace of clubs|pg||
nt|haans: but why do N wait|pg||
nt|haans: easy pass|pg||
nt|pelu: with screen we often have 2 bids a time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: when you use a preempt at 3 level at 1st seat that's only against economy of space principle|pg||
nt|pelu: so it could be East in problem|pg||
nt|haans: pass all|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|ady: this has esculated|pg||

nt|h_karluk: why not|pg||
nt|haans: if u pass 3@C sitting west can you miss game then?|pg||

mb|1S|nt|h_karluk: operator, undo?|pg||
nt|haans: sry :(|pg||

mb|1N|nt|szalay: 2@D: NF (std Polish approx.)|pg||
nt|pelu: with a better @h-suit u could open 1@H but not with J high|pg||

mb|d|nt|szalay: 3@C was @S raise|pg||
nt|sybarra: undoubled, that is good news |pg||
nt|ady: even undoubled  east west will lose several imps|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: nono, I bid correctly|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i think N would buy to 2@s|pg||
nt|szalay: double, pls|pg||
nt|chick: lebensohl sequence here|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2NT follows by 3@s i believe to ask stayman with @s stopper|pg||
nt|haans: 2 suits to cover |pg||
nt|haans: a good bid now is xx|pg||
nt|haans: if u have talked about it|pg||
nt|haans: dealy = no map |pg||
nt|chick: what would you play XX as, if you were S?|pg||
nt|xenya: tough for NS -- looks like they are in for a minus score now no matter what they might do|pg||
nt|po-s: - and if it means what you have agreed...|pg||
nt|haans: that would help|pg||
nt|yuval10: i only have pass and direct 3@s here.... Pass force for XX from S|pg||
nt|haans: hi sudden|pg||
nt|haans: how to find 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: doomed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Rotten suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: north and south also switched cards|pg||
nt|pelu: spects : 9-1 for pass :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Kib avg age, Peter? :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i cannot use a double there because of @s Ax, i know the ovecall suit quality is not bright there |pg||
nt|haans: very like bidding prempt after prempt |pg||
nt|ady: this will be a slaughter|pg||
nt|haans: you just dont do that|pg||
nt|sybarra: and its j high with no good spots!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In OR, South was no junior - passed in first hand, is that allowed in a junior-match?|pg||
nt|szalay: does anyone know meaning of bids?|pg||
nt|daman: no reason for South to bid|pg||
nt|chick: the OR has only played 5 boards (per the Movie), so it may be more than 30 minutes :)|pg||
nt|haans: fight every board|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|h_karluk: to me good lead, could cost worse to a @d lead|pg||
nt|daman: who is foing the yelling now?|pg||
nt|daman: doing*|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: still the Italians|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sharkey: the players probably took the wrong cards out|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: nope they all took their own slot|pg||
nt|sharkey: score 33-0 to Denmark and more to come...|pg||
nt|chick: in an auction like this, I would play 4@C as Stayman, but no idea what they do|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes guys!! |pg||
pc|d6|nt|szalay: I confess I could pass as East automatically|pg||
nt|szalay: over 1@C|pg||
nt|daman: they just got +100 from thin air|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|sybarra: may make 6 now |pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: too much technical stuff for me, i only know on/off button and how to use a mouse :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: you're advanced Hamdi...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: omg, after long years i learnt to use email system:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What is e-mail...?|pg||
nt|sharkey: ask Hamdo hans :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: ik heb een geheel gedraaid spel. Kan je een arbiter roepen?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hamdi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: at start i thought, some guy's name in Venezuala, bcos i saw a video abt it |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: tell oops was trying to contact someone else in the building|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And you might invite with 4 NT directly also|pg||
nt|szalay: well done Brigitta|pg||
nt|rnmalik: some imps coming your way with X also|pg||
nt|szalay: she wears the jeans|pg||
pc|d2|nt|frankaus: pass is the hardest bid to master in bridge :)|pg||
nt|szalay: light openings and overcalls they style can live cause another side|pg||
nt|ady: heart shift  best|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no other choice I think|pg||
nt|ady: hand 16 where west was down 1 in 4@H doubled   in OR  n/s made 4@D re-doubled|pg||
nt|ady: was 11 imps for world team|pg||
nt|rnmalik: compensation here for NS might gain some|pg||
nt|pelu: 4 out of 5 : I am junior :):)|pg||
nt|haans: psych|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45:  Wonder what 1 @S was - since East introduced a suit with 7-6-5-4 at the 4-level|pg||
pc|d4|nt|szalay: I think to open 7-4 in white is good bridge, regardless of your age|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now South likes his hand|pg||
nt|szalay: in white/red 4@C is an option, imho|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could also play for divided @d honours|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems preferred 3-3 35/6 %|pg||
nt|haans: 4th 5th spade|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That was what I tried to indicate..!|pg||
nt|chick: lucky for declarer, @SJ10 fall|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Still 2 losers|pg||
nt|szalay: likely 500 and 12 imps for Hungary..and: new leader:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: de Pagter wondering out loud whether Hop should've bid 2NT|pg||
nt|szalay: 1@S was: comp values, at most 3@S|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sharkey: we can follow jacco - just finsih the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: true but the other table played the hand it was supposed to be played|pg||
nt|sharkey: Makes on low @C lead...|pg||
nt|haans: opinion: gronkvist: they must cancel the board gronkvist: will the laws says so|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|szalay: u wont punish for light openings cause light overcalls and vica versa|pg||
nt|szalay: why not to take @C in hand?|pg||
nt|szalay: to start @D ruff?|pg||
nt|frankaus: maybe planning on a dummy reversal|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|sybarra: he may be thinking same thing,  maybe played too fast |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Now they're all saying I'm junior to me :P|pg||
nt|szalay: the tipical terrible "fashion-convention"|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 1@s showing less than 4 @s's, 8+ hcp|pg||
nt|szalay: it looks 800 now|pg||
nt|daman: they should be hugging each other|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: not in their  blood i think|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzeg: I could led the right guy lead but he led small club|pg||
nt|daman: nah  that's true|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hawe45:  Then I think, that East had minimum for his 4 @C-bid...!|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I love how 3/10 are people I know|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @d K ?? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yep|pg||
nt|haans: a spade please|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: they like nice clothes and to yell|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: the problem are not 13-14 HCP - but the bad suit|pg||
nt|daman: and gelato|pg||
pc|s6|nt|h_karluk: ok sir, thanks :)|pg||
nt|chick: yes, switch the @S8 and 7, different story|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: now K@C and club|pg||
nt|h_karluk: okay, say you entered the score, it helps to see in comparison? |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not allowed|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, seriously i do not think we can have ideal conditions at all times|pg||
nt|h_karluk: how they say? umm - lesser evil <my review>|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's what pre-empts are for, but I don't think Edgtton had a serious problem with that hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: soon east would be endplayed with a careful timing|pg||
nt|haans: opps in the dark|pg||
nt|szalay: the East probably didnt read Rodwell interview:|pg||
pc|d3|nt|szalay: to take trick first and think thereafter isnt a good omen|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: why not pitch ht|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is that the exit card?|pg||
nt|daman: East is in trouble |pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans: lavinthal for @H?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H pitchwas better but kept an exit card|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|szalay: why Ten?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that was the question|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
nt|daman: -500|pg||
pc|sK|nt|szalay: but first: make plan, move after that|pg||
nt|ady: down 4|pg||
nt|haans: normal carding?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: @H7 =========== no|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hawe45:  Entry-problems when decl sees the @D-layout|pg||
nt|sybarra: and possible he takes the @H's hook |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Which will lead to a HUGE score|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|szalay: http://www.bridgematters.com/rodwell.htm|pg||

pc|c8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|szalay: about pass as usefull bid|pg||
nt|daman: well done Turkey|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: hl even, all I know|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hawe45:  Show-up against North instead|pg||
nt|szalay: is it true?|pg||
nt|szalay: 1 off only?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: ruffed the diamond|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: apparently only 3 |pg||
pc|h4|pc|sT|pg||

pc|d9|nt|ralfwil: But of course when they are holding @c9, otherwise always a small @c|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: last hand of this session|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: actually this is an u25 tournament not u20 as one of the commentators mentioned|pg||

nt|szalay: it looks an interesting 3N|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!|pg||
nt|szalay: does West have way to show @D lead?|pg||
nt|szalay: or may be HIS lead, even better:)|pg||
nt|ady: if west is on lead to 3NT  may choose a heart when east has shown majors|pg||
nt|szalay: a bit optimistic, but acceptable 5@C|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 7/5/1 long time not seen|pg||
nt|haans: 1@C mbs?|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@s in OR = 5 card @S + a minor|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no denying |pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: thanks all, esp fellow commentators & operator|pg||

mb|1D|nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are back in about 1/2 hour |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes play went very fast here so that is why|pg||
nt|szalay: fast play seldom means good|pg||
nt|frankaus: fine operating Jacco <clap> <clap> <clap> <clap>|pg||
nt|szalay: I think South has INV with @Cs, lets say 3@C is normal or 2N...|pg||
nt|pelu: by West|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Strange, that 6 NT went down - you have 12 tricks with safin the @D-suit and take the losing @H-finesse|pg||
nt|szalay: South is female and 16-years old only|pg||
nt|szalay: 3@D was Rubenshol: @Hs, inv +|pg||
nt|szalay: doubt West wd pass it|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 3@D Switch, rather|pg||
nt|szalay: switch: dom and sub in one?:)|pg||
nt|szalay: South of course passes|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|vugraphzeg: it was west thinking but i try to do 2 bids at a time|pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks like it should make |pg||
nt|szalay: r u sure?|pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder|pg||
nt|szalay: 1@S, 1@H and how many @Cs?|pg||
nt|ady: looks like west has mis understood partners bid|pg||
nt|szalay: its Molenaar's double session|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: west might have explained this as weak with @d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: imho 5@c unbelievable|pg||
nt|haans: 3 down in 5@Cx|pg||
nt|haans: 2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C is not an overbid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could any lead a trump from QT - say to 5 clubs contract? :)|pg||
nt|haans: 3@Dx|pg||
nt|szalay: thx all, it was fun, and interesting|pg||
nt|szalay: probably West, her screenmate is trhinking|pg||
nt|szalay: am I right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: correct|pg||
nt|szalay: Danke|pg||
nt|rnmalik: absolutely and difficult waters for EW|pg||
nt|szalay: 4@S RKC or rather cue?|pg||
nt|szalay: muddy waters, rather|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: possibly 3@s would come|pg||
nt|xenya: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=85&Itemid=79 for standings after 9 rounds|pg||
mb|1N|nt|szalay: I think its going down for @S lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes!!  here we go again|pg||
nt|szalay: 6@C for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: East wasnt passing, I could tell you that|pg||
nt|xenya: E seems to have taken partner's 4@C too seriously|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what would you lead vs 5@c ? @h A/K or @s A+x ? :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT the easiest as they lay    but likely to play 5@C  which would certainly go down to a trump lead   4@H can make|pg||
nt|haans: at last|pg||
nt|daman: thanks to th NBB for letting us bring this to you    thanks also to the Sponsors|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: E likes his hand|pg||
nt|haans: game at or|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i do not believe my eyes, 4261 with 6 hcp and 3@d 3rd seat both nonvul :)|pg||
nt|davidb: not a  lucky decision |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: dbl gazzili like bid?|pg||
nt|ady: not likely to play 4@H|pg||
nt|frankaus: have you heard my view on playing 5 minor contracts?|pg||
nt|ady: managed 3NY OR|pg||
nt|ady: OR|pg||
nt|h_karluk: esp when N showed his interest on unbid suits (the reds)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry there were a huge misjudgement|pg||
nt|sybarra: might we try 3 @C now?|pg||
nt|pelu: ther5e are 8 "top" tricks - but not when u take @cK (see the 10) and run @cJ :(|pg||
nt|ady: must have got club position wrong in OR  to go so badly down in 3NT     low club and when 10 appeared went up with king and finessed 9|pg||
nt|pelu: 0,1 sec late, David :)|pg||
nt|ady: yes    you are too quick for me Peter|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: if u travel across the World, better to agree 2suiter overcalls|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: the problem was the semi natural 1@c openingbid i think|pg||
nt|szalay: if a bid (semi)natural, better to treat it as natural, eg. to play (1m)-2m as Michaels vs. prepared 1m yet|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to misguess hts here also |pg||
nt|h_karluk: obviously - east players happy with that 7 hcp|pg||
nt|yuval10: maybe too much for a 4-3-3-3 hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 4@S cue|pg||
nt|szalay: I predict -1 and Hungary's win|pg||
nt|yuval10: this is the last board of the 10th round now|pg||
nt|chick: S is likely to get endplayed |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: declarer didn't play for endplay but just claimed on 2 finesses|pg||
nt|yuval10: you can hardly endplay him|pg||
nt|daman: and thanks to BBO    without them we would not be able to watch this|pg||
pc|c7|nt|szalay: but grand slam try with missing ace was a mistake, anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 1430, I guess|pg||
nt|xenya: admittedly, he does have a great hand|pg||
nt|szalay: nbo pressure for N-S now|pg||
nt|szalay: the real issue is 3m is nat or stopper asking|pg||
nt|haans: not to happy with @H lead|pg||
nt|ady: in what   4@H?|pg||
nt|haans: nt|pg||
nt|frankaus: its like kissing your own sister - even when its right ---- its hard to get excited about your prospects|pg||
nt|szalay: any bet?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good defense now and we have a new leader:)|pg||
nt|szalay: every dutchman says: he will make it|pg||
nt|szalay: btw, this is the last board of set and last set for me|pg||
nt|szalay: thx all your patience, it was funny, anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: no defense, however good, will work if declarer gets @Hs right|pg||
nt|szalay: that is what bet about|pg||
nt|szalay: bt w to play safety @H in good direction is risky:|pg||
nt|szalay: he could lose 2 @Ds and a @H|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Vladimir:)|pg||
nt|szalay: so better to play for @H to king and small one, imho|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Rashed:)|pg||
nt|szalay: do u agree?|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|po-s: why not|pg||
nt|chick: don't have to, it's automatic|pg||
nt|po-s: why would you need to - in 5H defenders helped a lot|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hawe45:  Is this result correct from =R - 10 tricks with two @H-losers and 3 potential trump-losers?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  From OR|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But still|pg||
pc|cA|nt|szalay: time for @S switch yet, and likely 2 off|pg||
nt|szalay: c u in 30 minutes|pg||
nt|szalay: byebye|pg||
nt|pelu: now 25-0 could be 25-24!|pg||
nt|haans: hung is trying to show his strength|pg||
nt|ady: yes Netherlands good comeback|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If he thinks he has that strong a hand, why did he not reverse into 2@H?|pg||
nt|ady: well the 2 club rebid did not exactly convey the hand|pg||
nt|haans: his opinion for a long time|pg||
nt|davidb: to leave the X . 3D  is ok for  juniors openings|pg||
nt|rnmalik: might play small from table to 9-safety play|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks, you interpreted my feelings :)|pg||
nt|szalay: it will be push, thx all, c u soon|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thx buddy, c ya soon|pg||
nt|szalay: so from 52 cards 5@H is makeable now|pg||
nt|daman: the next session is scheduled for 12 minutes from now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: once again holy ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a-ha North pushes his opps to game|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@C er helt ude i hampen|pg||
nt|frankaus: may escape  with -2|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: south asking west what double means|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: west doesnt have a real clue|pg||
nt|sybarra: how about "I think we can beat the contract"  as an answer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And they can|pg||
pc|cT|nt|xenya: but S preempted -- that may be a factor|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sharkey: Sac vs 3@H?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there were a passed hand double and imho showed @h+@d|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem is that the X from = @H, so 2@h is what??|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe that's too simple|pg||
nt|haans: we have said neither|pg||
nt|pelu: so play: X = dont lead @s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: but will they?|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|xenya: this stands no chance of course -- let's see if he can get out for -1|pg||
nt|ady: high spade likely lead|pg||
nt|pelu: some play after opp has shown 2 suits, that a bid here is sopper and no stopper in the other suit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hope they make postmortem especially about this board|pg||
nt|sybarra: ht lead spade thru?|pg||
nt|daman: sorry  22 minutes|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk4: sorry for speaking Danish|pg||
nt|h_karluk: makeable now|pg||
nt|haans: small @D????????????????|pg||
nt|ady: win and duck a heart  will make|pg||
nt|ady: I think this may be down 1   so -200  will gain against 400 OR|pg||
nt|sybarra: or now,  of @S, H! switch,  spade thru?|pg||
nt|pelu: in S some play RD = I am not sure we sh play 3Nt and Pass = OK with me|pg||
nt|szalay: I just said: its not the percentage line|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|frankaus: bed time here back latter in day european time|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes this happened, north couldnt play south for 4@D|pg||
nt|xenya: i doubt that -- W's clubs are too small|pg||
nt|xenya: setting up @Ds would mean seetting up trump tricks for N|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu frank @H |pg||
nt|xenya: but i overlooked the fact that the defence had presented E with a trick -- now he certainly can make 11 and must be thinking how to get 12  |pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: can establish spades    but has no trump control|pg||
nt|h_karluk: !k was the lead i expected|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h K|pg||
nt|sharkey: Actually first time the Danes made a "crazy" bid this match I think|pg||
nt|daman: that may not happen     this match is behind|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West must switch to a diamond, heart not good enough|pg||
nt|pelu: doubtshowing RD|pg||

nt|ady: now possible overtrick|pg||
nt|szalay: but @C is option yet:|pg||
nt|pelu: wrong @C then East nust play @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Lhuisser grabs his head already|pg||
nt|pelu: West|pg||

pc|s3|nt|szalay: 2 off: +3|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  has to be less than 3 down |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Lets say J@S and @DA and another @D would reduce losses somewhat|pg||
nt|szalay: if he leads @H to king: -5|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|VugraphPl1: 100%|pg||
nt|haans: why jump up|pg||
