nt|athene: east can beat it but south ruffs|pg||
nt|athene: then if west overruffs, south gets the @HAQ|pg||
nt|athene: the way it went, the defence led hearts giving declarer that finesse AND the trump coup|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|han: 4SX might be -500 but can be -800 if the defense manages to play trumps quickly enough|pg||
mb|d|nt|royhughes: This looks like EW should stop in a partial, but with the very lucky lie of the cards they can make 3NT.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|han: what's double here?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Welcome all to segment 7/9 of the Australian Women's Trial|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|han: is it "please bid 4H if you have hearts"?|pg||
nt|han: or is it just penalty|pg||
nt|sybarra: Berten's had a great hand.... yikes that is over the top..|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@H on a minor suit squeeze?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|han: no chance on this lead|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|fann4: I think 6@H was a great bid, though it won't make.|pg||
nt|hedyg: i agree Jeff|pg||
nt|han: west plays 5-6, high-low would not be asking for a ruff but would be suit preferenc|pg||
nt|han: e|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: no cost to leading another club is there?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|han: so 5-6 should ask for a club return|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|hedyg: it was a pretty good slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: just wrongsided|pg||
nt|royhughes: EW had a very lucky 3N, since diamonds were 2-2 onside, and clubs 4-4.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|royhughes: A normal result would be 3@d making for 110.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|royhughes: NS ran a risk of getting doubled in 3@s, on their shaky 4-3 fit|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d8|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|royhughes: Declarer can make another trick by forcing the defense with the 4th club|pg||

nt|hedyg: well if not the @Cs certainly looked better|pg||
nt|han: south showed 4+ hearts and dummy has 1098|pg||
mb|p|nt|han: not a great suit to switch to|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|vugrapha2: Thompson is thinking...|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: There is some interesting distribution around the table here, but nobody has much of a fit|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|han: he didn't know that one club trick was enough, then he also needed spades to split 3-3|pg||
mb|2D|an|!|nt|hedyg: in @H he needed 2 finesses , in @c just 1|pg||
nt|han: but he could combine chances, hook heart, cash AK of clubs, if queen drops, test spades and if they split he doesn't need the secondheart hook|pg||
nt|hedyg: and then 1 of the black suits to come in|pg||
nt|royhughes: This might be a good place for EW to stop (1@h, I mean)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: 2@d should play fairly well, too, with the diamonds playable for 2 losers|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|sybarra: well 3 @C  is better that 4 sp (I think) |pg||
pc|sK|nt|hedyg: pull AK@S before @d ruff|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|helene_t:  difficult to reach 2@h playing standard methods. E might want to bid 2@h over 1NT but for most pairs that would show extra values|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|royhughes: South can ruff hearts, though, which should set the contract|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|han: in the latest results, Schollaardt-Wortel are leading by 1 IMP|pg||
nt|han: second place is for Verbeek-van Zwol|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|royhughes: South needs just one ruff to beat this|pg||
nt|royhughes: and this is North's last chance|pg||
mc|8|nt|royhughes: Apparently the defence did not find the heart ruff, and 2@d made|pg||
pg||

nt|vugrapha3: What does everyone think of norths 2@h bid?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: (a spec has asked)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am already on record as saying it is at or near bottom of my list|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: but all alternatives are bad|pg||
mb|2H|an|5H + 5Minor|nt|athene: it was a bit unlucky i think|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|d|mb|3N|an|!|nt|marlowepi: a suitable hand on which S will pass 2H could give us an easy 3N:   AQxx   A  Jxx  AJxxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: and that hand fails in 2H on a normal 2 break|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might get this right - hold up in clubs and play @DA|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: actually the @C9 gets important|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: oh ok, we aren't in 3NT any more, Toto|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: if someone could put together enough money to pay me to play Muiderberg (unlikely, but not impossible), I still would not do it on this N hand without a 200% bonus|pg||
nt|athene: what is especially wrong with this hand?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: you mean the idea of emphasising your Qxxxx and leaving your KQ10xxx on the shelf is just evil?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what N has is clubs, with some hearts on the side. at favorable vul in 3rd seat, N wants to be opening a large number of clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but the clubs are a *minor* suit|pg||
nt|athene: such things aren't shown in polite society - or even amongst bridge players|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: RULE  1 of competitive bidding -- when opps have spades, all the other suits you hold have identical market value|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|s9|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the major / minor distinction disintegrates |pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: one thing we have seen from this match and the previous one is that when people open bids showing 5-5, you perhaps ought not to be too distressed and surprised when suits break ...|pg||
nt|athene: badly|pg||
nt|athene: (4@HX for 800 last set, and so on)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: the main effect of such bids is to puch opps into games they would not otherwise bid and then tell them how to make it thanks to the gratis info|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: well, this one isn't making :) but at least it isn't doubled|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c7|pc|h8|pc|s8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the test of a bid is not "did it get us a good result", but rather: "did it get us a good resul we would not otherwise have gotten"|pg||

qx|c19|st||md|1S98743HAJ7DQ963CJ,SKT62HDAT742C9632,S5HQ6543DKCKQT754,SAQJHKT982DJ85CA8|sv|e|mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: North has an interesting hand to bid here|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|han: 5C made at the other table is a very good result here|pg||
nt|royhughes: She chooses to open at the one level in her longest suit|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|han: I don't expect Bertens and Westra to get to game after 1NT|pg||
nt|helene_t:  3@h shows a good spade raise. 3@s ould have been weaker|pg||
mb|2C|nt|helene_t:  would|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: so much for @cs|pg||
nt|han: and certainly not after 2H|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: sorry misread the handwritting|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|han: maybe it is possible, if Huub now bids 3C|pg||
nt|hedyg: gazilli would work well here|pg||
nt|fann4: They got to 5@C other table after a 2@H rebid.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would bid 2 @C on the first round,  (yes I know have 6 hts) |pg||
nt|han: Westra has a difficult decision|pg||
nt|han: I must admit I would have bid 2C instead of 2H|pg||
nt|fann4: Me too.|pg||
nt|hedyg: that @c suit is certainly good enough to bid|pg||
nt|han: don't really understand 2H with these suits, but in old school you have to rebid your major with a minimal 6-4|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe they do not have to have 4 to bid it |pg||
nt|fann4: And the @H suit is weak enough to not have to rebid.|pg||
nt|hedyg: over 2@c by S N could have bid 2@s etc|pg||
nt|royhughes: This is another deal where no one has much of a fit|pg||
pc|d5|nt|royhughes: Well, NS have a good heart fit but it splits 5-0|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: ok so lets try 3@s now|pg||
nt|han: 3S keeps 3NT in the game|pg||
nt|sybarra: and one suggestion is that N could bid 2 @C  over 1 ht |pg||
nt|han: I think Bertens will bid 3NT, he has told his story|pg||
nt|hedyg: if Bertens finds a 4@d bid now..|pg||
nt|han: and he even has help in diamonds|pg||
nt|royhughes: It looks like declarer might manage 5 clubs, 2 hearts and a diamond, to just make this|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|helene_t:  W's name has been corrected. thanks, operator :)|pg||
nt|mwigor: hi all|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: hi michael :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: But maybe the defensive heart ruffs will beat it|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mwigor: this looks like one down|pg||
pc|s5|nt|han: oh, I was wrong about that|pg||
nt|hedyg: think again? LOL|pg||
nt|han: they reached it, now they have to make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: they got it right,  thats why they are playing :)|pg||
nt|han: Schollaardt loves underleading kings|pg||
nt|han: so he'll be happy here, spades or diamonds|pg||
nt|han: I would guess diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Westra says: I meant 3@s as a super card for @c's and he saw that as well|pg||
nt|han: because of the auction|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|han: high from  even with an honor|pg||
nt|han: slavinski leads|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes and Bertens understood that|pg||
nt|han: toughest lead for declarer|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think East may have to find a heart shift now|pg||
nt|royhughes: which is not easy|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mwigor: maybe a chance to make|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|han: he has only 1 loser but where will he get his tricks?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mwigor: @sA ruffing @s hook is probably best both on the hand and single dummy|pg||
nt|mwigor: but looks like she cant quite cope with the 4-1 trump break|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|c7|nt|han: this is a bit dangerous|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|d6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|fann4: @SK lead other room made it very easy. (Even a small @S - same thing)|pg||
nt|mwigor: ok many down now i think|pg||
nt|royhughes: However, declarer cannot keep control|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|sybarra: he seems to have a plan |pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|cT|pc|d8|pg||
nt|mwigor: needed to keep the low trump in dummy to have any hope of setting up lots of tricks without losing control|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h2|nt|han: good guesses here, hard to beat a declarer who guesses like this|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzfv: They're done at this table|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: official playing time is still 19 minutes|pg||
nt|fann4: Bye all|pg||
nt|hedyg: bye Jeff ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: table will remain open|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu jeff |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: and after 19 minutes the last round will begin|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Monique :)|pg||
nt|han: Huub pointed out that his line here was 100%|pg||
nt|han: if the club finesse loses then he still makes|pg||
nt|han: Also, he couldn't combine his chances in 2NT|pg||
nt|han: He was squeezed on the run of the clubs to make an early decision|pg||
nt|han: hearts was by far the best chance for two extra tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: about 5 minutes left before we restart|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry our song and dance routine is not enlivening |pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Maarten and Meike are back at the table|pg||

nt|han: Bertens must expect good hands for the vulnerable 2D bid|pg||
nt|royhughes: I don't know if declarer can do much better -- maybe by crashing dummy's jack of trumps she could keep control but still finish one down|pg||
nt|royhughes: it was very complicated|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2D|an|4spades&longer heaerts|nt|hedyg: ok ty Monique|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is butler scoring (pairs)  the imps are averaged and the scores compared to average for imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: This looks like Flannery, an opening bid with 45xx|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: AQJxxx with nothing outside is the least I'd expect when vul.|pg||
nt|han: ok, but you are not Dutch|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: welcome back|pg||
nt|royhughes: Feel free to correct me, Ally -- I really don't know!|pg||
nt|royhughes: Here it has the serendipitous effect of reaching partner's long suit|pg||

nt|helene_t:  interesting 1NT rebid. do you know if that is systematic, Fiona?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|han: it is quite uncommon here|pg||
pc|c8|nt|helene_t:  I suppose NS play a weak 1NT opening, so that the 1NT rebid shows 15-17 points. |pg||
pc|cK|nt|fann4: How low do the Dutch go - when vul?|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 cards and ??? |pg||
nt|han: what do you mean 6 cards?|pg||
nt|hedyg: does 2@c promise a major?|pg||
nt|han: Does QJxxx count as 6 cards?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mwigor: it feels like south bid her hand one time too many there|pg||
nt|mwigor: a little lucky not to be doubled|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: sorry i havent got the play |pg||
nt|mwigor: np|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c6|nt|fann4: Pushy invite by N here - maybe the 3 tens influenced him.|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|royhughes: I guess 3NT can be made on the NS cards, when the diamonds block -- there are 8 top tricks and a 9th can be built|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|han: I think it is an automatic invite, this is a very nice 8-count|pg||
nt|fann4: QJxxx . not in my book. Vul I didn't think it was in anyone's book.|pg||
nt|han: This is a tricky hand for NS|pg||
nt|han: we know the club queen is dropping|pg||
nt|han: but will Huub test that before he takes the second heart hook?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|helene_t:  the club lead actually gives N a chance of making the contract, if she finds the queen of spades|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: he will disc @hs|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|han: oh wait, he doesn't need the heart hook|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhhhh no|pg||
nt|han: he'll just play on clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: not anymore|pg||
nt|royhughes: Sometimes it's hard to defend hands that are played 'backwards' -- the long trumps in dummy|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|han: no, this is not looking good for Bertens|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think NS might have managed to beat it two by leading trumps and preventing the club ruff|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|hedyg: all eggs in the @H basket|pg||
pc|c9|nt|helene_t:  but she doesnt kno that hearts are 5-3. if they were 4-4 then conceeding a diamond trick would be the way to make the contract without having to guess spades|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: Declarer could have gotten a good count on the hand-- if East had the spade king, then it was very unlikely he'd hold the q@d as that would be a 12count shes shown up with|pg||
mb|1S|nt|han: sloppy play by Westra|pg||
mb|2C|nt|helene_t:  multi 2@d ( a weak 2 in either hearts or spades). 2@h is to play in case E has hearts|pg||

nt|han: On the other hand, should Schollaardt have prevented this by returning a diamond before declarer had the chance to play the spade ace?|pg||
nt|han: I think so|pg||
nt|han: yes 1C is 2+, as it is for almost every pair in  this field|pg||
nt|helene_t:  North has an awkward hand since she could double a 2@s opening and bid 2NT over a 2@h opening, but she doesn't know which E has|pg||

nt|marlowepi: invitational|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: in that case E might have bid the game with a max, a club fit, a spade stop, and prime side cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes maybe, even with no club honour|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: the main thing is to take advantage of the achilles' heels (or downright indiscretions) in the opponents' choice of methods. make them pay|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: double?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: this was a bit of a pushy double, although perhaps north decided that it wasn't giving so much away, as the bidding had done that anyway|pg||

nt|athene: not sure it will matter so much|pg||
nt|marlowepi: delete the "mayb"|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: if 2S showed a Muiderbergish type opening (biggest systemic gift possible to oppoinents), then perhaps the double by N meant "lead your minor"|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: small spade towards the @SJ now|pg||
nt|athene: but since declarer can't finesse clubs for a diamond pitch, he has a lot of work to do|pg||

nt|marlowepi: still must make, there are 2 ntries to dummy|pg||
nt|ardek: low spade next is a good choice|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s7|pc|h8|nt|athene: spade now and south wins and plays club|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: and declarer can't lead both red suits towards her hand, so one down|pg||
nt|athene: now if north tries to put her partner in with a spade, declarer can recover|pg||
nt|athene: just bash up with the @SA and draw trumps |pg||
nt|marlowepi: still puzzled by failure to unblock club jack|pg||
nt|athene: but a simple diamond force instead kills the contract stone dead|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: diouble looked even better better after that|pg||

mb|2N|nt|athene: 2@C presumably majors - this won't work out so well for EW|pg||

nt|helene_t:  2@c showing majors, or showing hearts+another suit, Fiona? Do you know?|pg||
nt|athene: the question is whether declarer can hold the losers to @CAK, @DA, @HK|pg||
nt|royhughes: Did she make the ace of diamonds?|pg||
mb|p|nt|han: We can see the result of one of EW's competitors, Verbeek-van Zwol|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: it was hard to catch those pitches|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: Well, they will still gain imps for down one - West in the other room definitely took her eye off the ball|pg||
nt|athene: got the @HJ lead and tried the @HQ, so north got three ruffs|pg||
nt|royhughes: Was 2@s some sort of 2-suited bid?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|han: This looks like down 1, good save for EW as Wortel is unlikely to find the low club lead necessary to beat 4H!|pg||

nt|han: I'm surprised that Begas did not act over 3NT by the way|pg||
nt|fann4: Presumably the @H3 cannot be from Q543|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H hard to read?|pg||

nt|fann4: On the underlead S now 'knows' N has the @SA|pg||
nt|hedyg: smallest @H probably asking for a @c return|pg||
nt|fann4: Right - and the suit preference implication.|pg||
nt|han: the underlead might have been necessary, picture declarer with a singleton spade and Qx of clubs|pg||
nt|fann4: Declarer coulbd be 1-2-8-2|pg||

nt|royhughes: Was the queen of spades really returned?  That looks costly|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Yup - 5/5|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|athene: I think the best chance for south to beat this by two, is to attack in clubs - play three rounds of clubs giving a ruff/discard|pg||
nt|athene: then hold up in trumps with the intention of leading a fourth club and getting trump control|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: it might not quite work as the cards lie, but that's the general sort of strategy you follow against a 4-4 fit when you have Axxx trumps|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|helene_t:  If dummy ruff clubs twice, S will make @h9|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: yes and if declarer ruffs one club in each hand, south gets a long heart|pg||

pc|c9|pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|c7|pg||

mb|p|nt|han: good result for EW in the other table, 3NT not yet made but with the @hKQ onside it probably will|pg||
nt|han: Wortel will invite and Schollaardt will accept, I'm sure :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has nice spotcards|pg||
nt|hedyg: worth at least another hcp|pg||
mb|d|mb|1N|an|!|mb|p|nt|royhughes: West avoids an under-strength response, so EW should stop in a partial|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|helene_t:  yes, but N doesnt have the values to double 2@h and S doesn't have the shape for it|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
nt|royhughes: If the defence ducks a heart, they can take 4 hearts and the ace of clubs, holding this to one overtrick|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: i like the diamond lead|pg||
nt|poohbear: @h lead for the money|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|han: one hurdle taken|pg||
nt|athene: rather than the club chosen in the other room|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fann4: Impossible to go down here.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|han: good try, small spade, but it doesn't look like it will yield here|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: it's a low-level contract; you have trump control - probably there's no great urgency to get busy doing things|pg||
nt|helene_t:  declarer will probably discard a club on the diamonds so she doesnt have to guess the clubs|pg||
pc|hA|nt|han: a spade return will certainly make Schollaardt nervous but there is little he can do but finesse in diamonds and hearts|pg||
nt|athene: yes, the defence can't organise to put her to a guess in clubs|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: with north having no side entry|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d3|nt|poohbear: Still not easy. Need to guess @cs |pg||
nt|royhughes: Declarer erred by covering the heart 10 -- she had a sure stopper by playing low (if that's what happened)|pg||
nt|royhughes: She has a good chance of still making it, though|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|poohbear: opps might not be able to take 5 tricks anyway|pg||
pc|h2|nt|poohbear: a low @c now is best but declarer can still make by playing off winners and conceding tricks rto north who will have to give dummy the 9th trick|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hedyg: if Jansma thought N had an entry to his hand a @s back would work better than a @c switch|pg||
pc|d2|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|poohbear: back to the straight @c guess. Declarer runs winners and in the 4 card ending keeps Qx   KJ  and leads a @c|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: still it might not have been necessary to attack clubs|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s3|nt|han: plenty of communication, will make with an overtrick|pg||

nt|athene: try to double NS in 2 of a major|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|athene: they might if they get into a doubling rhythm, but they might just bid 3nt in view of the vulnerability, especially if NS run to hearts where neither E nor W has a 4-card holding|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: now north has a problem if double isn't penalties and pass isn't forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: looks as though double is takeout, but east will surely pass|pg||
nt|athene: double in these auctions says "pass with 4 trumps" so west isn't doubling with a void or stiff usually|pg||
nt|athene: south might not even get his @HK - he might be held to just the two top trumps on a trump lead?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but the irony is, if E passes holding 4 trumps W knows they almostr surely belong in 3N|pg||
nt|athene: can EW take two trumps, four in each minor, and the @HA for six down?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the @S5 is a big enough spot card|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: the defense always slops at least one trick in these situatiopns|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: east and west play the happiest "pass" cards ever seen|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: probably not the happiest bill. you havent seen some of my third-seat poreempts|pg||
nt|athene: haha|pg||
nt|athene: Meckstroth says something interesting about this sort of auction|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: he says his partnership has a deliberate policy to go headhunting in these auctions|pg||
nt|athene: they might lose some imps when they just get 500 against 600|pg||
nt|marlowepi: let the opps bid as much as they like so you will know the maximum when you finally bid 3N?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: but it works well for opps to know they aren't just going to "give up and bid their game"|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|athene: because opps can't mess around so much|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: She covered.|pg||
nt|royhughes: but recovered|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: unlucky 6@D here|pg||
nt|poohbear: Of course there really isnt a guess since South would always rise ace and cash a @s and put a @H thru |pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|royhughes: This looks like a routine 3NT for EW, making 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
mb|1S|nt|han: This could become interesting|pg||
nt|han: white against red there is no stopping Schollaardt with a suit like this|pg||
nt|han: Double by north will show values|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 6nt will make if north takes the @SA too soon as she will get squeezed in spades and diamonds, even assuming declarer doesn't pick the diamonds|pg||
nt|poohbear: havent seen a 9-11 NT in a long time!|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fann4: As you said earlier Han 'When in Holland".... do as the Dutch do.|pg||
nt|sybarra: same auction as other table |pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d major 1suiter?|pg||
nt|han: Paulissen takes a more direct approach|pg||
nt|fann4: I'm referring to super light weak 2 openings you discussed.|pg||
nt|han: there doesn't seem to be any lead that challenges declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: 3-3 breaks in the pointed suits make it easy.|pg||
nt|han: this is not easy for declarer, if east has Kx or Qx then it is better to play low|pg||
nt|hedyg: J@h makes it even easier|pg||
nt|han: so that the suit blocks|pg||
nt|fann4: @HJ is the 10th trick, and finally E will have to give a @C trick for 11 tricks.|pg||
nt|han: that might be necessary if west has the club ace|pg||
nt|han: playing low and taking the ace at trick 1 would be the way to go then, but now it is the way to go down|pg||
nt|hedyg: better assume W has 2 honours in @H for his bid|pg||
nt|fann4: Playing low is still ok. He can duck the @H and later still make 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|hedyg: can he if W has the A@C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably trying to figure out if Schollardt would lead low holding kqxxxxx |pg||
nt|han: if he plays for Kx or Qx he has to win trick 1 with the ace|pg||
nt|fann4: But looking at it single dummy it has some problems.|pg||
nt|han: with spades and diamonds 3-3 he'll still make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|han: very dangerous problem|pg||
nt|han: What's more likely, that west has KQxxxx or either Kxxxxx or Qxxxxx?|pg||
nt|han: the 2 shows an even number with at least one honor|pg||
nt|hedyg: KQ|pg||
nt|royhughes: Not too exciting at imps -- at matchpoints the overtricks matter.  NS get a 3rd trick if they start a heart|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|athene: it looks as though 2@D was not game-forcing for either EW pair here|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise west would surely bid 2nt or 3@D over 2@S|pg||
nt|helene_t:  yes, they play Acol|pg||
pc|s9|nt|han: with K109 or Q109 he would have led higher|pg||
nt|hedyg: or an odd nr with no honours|pg||
nt|sybarra: he can not see 9 yet  now closer |pg||
nt|han: I think so too Hedy, good decision by Jansma|pg||
nt|poohbear: I assume 2@d was a transfer. I dont like transfers playing weak NT cause it gives next hand 2 chances to get into the auction|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@h makes by force 5@h tricks 2@d 2@c and 1@s |pg||
nt|poohbear: so as long as declarer pulls trumps no worries|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: sorry, I obviously opened it on the wrong side. :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|poohbear: The open room EW has an EXCELLENT mathpoint result|pg||
nt|poohbear: -400 will beat all the -420s and 450s|pg||
nt|poohbear: not as good at imps|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: even if declarer leads a spade to the @SK early it doesn't really help her all that much|pg||
nt|helene_t:  4NT quantitative, E can pass but with two points more than she already showed she must bid 6|pg||
nt|athene: she doesn't want to risk another one because then she would go down if south ducked @SAJx and diamonds might be breaking all the time|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|han: I think we can rule out the case of ann odd number without honors Hedy, Maarten is crazy but wouldn't bid on five small hearts|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: interesting pass - i should have thought 2@D was the normal action|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: with bad primary suits and over half the hand in two doubletons, pass could be a winner|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: for example, when responder is 13 in spades & diamonds|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is not an endorsement of pass, simply an acknowledgment that it is a shot with a genuine chance|pg||
nt|athene: a touch-and-go contract here|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can set up four spades and @HAK without too much problem|pg||

mb|p|nt|fann4: N can't be the one to take over.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ardek: North might have doubled at either of her opportunities|pg||
nt|royhughes: EW did well at the other table to make 1NT.  It will be difficult for declarer to take 8 tricks|pg||
nt|royhughes: 4 trumps and the AK of hearts is 6, and likely 1 more trick 'in the wash', we used to say|pg||
nt|royhughes: By that I mean it is hard for NS to untangle all their tricks, and declarer is likely to get a club or a diamond, or a slow heart|pg||
nt|royhughes: Glanger did well to stay out of the bidding with her balanced 13-count|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: without any clear reason to lead a club, S should have done what comes naturally and taken a heart off the board|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: Welcome Back - sorry for the disconnection folks|pg||
nt|royhughes: This looks like a routine 3NT making 4 for NS|pg||
mb|1C|nt|han: could be a bad hand for slam (not with A AK)|pg||
nt|han: depending on agreement|pg||
nt|poohbear: but common position when you have sure trump tricks. Dont overruff with your sure trump trick|pg||
mb|1D|nt|shevek: weak NT is a winner here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: in 2/1,  you do not need to jump,   so 3 @S shows sp support,  start the cue bidding pard....|pg||
nt|royhughes: with some chance of making 5 if the defence ducks a heart|pg||
nt|royhughes: But let's see if NS solve their bidding problem|pg||
mb|3C|nt|poohbear: I am told 9-11  and a singleton common for the NT opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|han: Marjolein, the wife of Maarten Schollaardt, is sitting next to me now|pg||
nt|han: so pardon me if we are a little biased|pg||
nt|han: double of 1D is "takeout", not penalty|pg||
nt|hedyg: not a strong t/o ..|pg||
nt|fann4: Can't see what N can do but pass|pg||
nt|han: Paulissen has both majors so he'll want to compete, Jansma has shown interest in competing in the majors|pg||
nt|hedyg: is he thinking psyche maybe?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: He passed, but as we are playing with screens I have to enter bid by 2 at the time, for NE and SW|pg||
nt|sybarra: great club partial, I so not see 3nt making by ew|pg||
nt|shevek: a more agressive south could've doubled 1@d|pg||
nt|royhughes: A normal action for South might be to cuebid clubs, suggesting a strong raise|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: 3|pg||
nt|royhughes: Then North might bid 3NT based on the high cards and club stoppers|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: ok ty Monique|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I  might be wrong |pg||
nt|shevek: I think they pplay strong NT in 3rd|pg||
nt|athene: you mean if east opened 1NT you think that would stop north? surely north is balancing 2@H on the auction 1!N - 2@D; 2@H passed round to her?|pg||
nt|helene_t:  yes, we saw E opening 1NT on 17 in 3rd|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, as it happened in OR|pg||
nt|shevek: my guess is Fuller will bid 4@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|helene_t:  may make if she doesnt get  a diamond lead|pg||
nt|helene_t:  3@d shows a good spade raise, 3@s would have been weaker|pg||
nt|royhughes: A jump cuebid often shows a decent limit raise with 4 trumps -- I don't know what it means for NS|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: *so =do not |pg||
nt|han: this is not a good partial, down after a heart lead|pg||
nt|royhughes: They have arrived in the right contract|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hedyg: @h lead?|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm|pg||
nt|han: but now it makes with an over|pg||
nt|han: this could be good or bad|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree, the @H lead kills 3 nt |pg||
nt|athene: i think 3@H is a better bid|pg||
nt|shevek: re-wind pls|pg||
nt|athene: because north can't possibly want to bid 3@H naturally here but she might want to bid 3@D naturally|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Fuller appears astonished|pg||
nt|shevek: oops|pg||
nt|athene: suppose north has seven solid diamonds and nothing else|pg||
nt|athene: south sorry|pg||
nt|helene_t:  yes 3@h would be less prone to misunderstanidng|pg||
nt|athene: she would bid like this wouldn't she?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: when you have two cue-bids available, choose the one that partner really, really won't pass|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@c is shortness with @h support|pg||
nt|poohbear: splinter|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think West's best chance might be to hope partner has the heart queen|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|royhughes: Then a low heart return would take 5 tricks -- maybe that's what happened at the other table (letting declarer make 5)|pg||

nt|poohbear: Declarer could have just played for 3-2 trumps|pg||

nt|poohbear: bit the @h length with the @d length so no worries|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|poohbear: after trumps were 3-2|pg||
nt|royhughes: This looks like a fun deal.|pg||
nt|royhughes: NS need to find their diamond fit -- it looks like they can make a slam|pg||
nt|royhughes: It may not be easy, with East bidding spades|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|athene: declarer in 3nt in the other room took a few wrong views, but the hand isn't trivial|pg||
nt|royhughes: In the other room, North opened 1@d, which certainly makes finding diamonds easier.  South jumped to 6!|pg||
mb|2H|nt|poohbear: We are starting to build an audience Fee :) up to 18 !! at this rate we might get to 21 by board 16 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: the secret is to avoid playing in your long suit :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: lol yay :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|royhughes: 1@d is a normal opening on the North cards, but some people open 1@c, and some even 1NT|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: The open had 4@sx by east|pg||
nt|royhughes: that might go for 1100 or even 1400 -- what was the result?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: its in play now. I'll tell you when its over|pg||
mb|6D|nt|helene_t:  3@c asking for a 5-card major|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@c natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|helene_t:  3@d shows a 4-card major but denies a 5-card major|pg||
nt|athene: declarer set off on diamonds but then changed her mind and went over to hearts|pg||
nt|shevek: so south is marked with at most 3-3 in the Maj|pg||
nt|royhughes: Glanger takes her best guess, and it's a good one|pg||
nt|royhughes: I don't know how Ally, our operator, manages all her work at this table and still manages to peek at others|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Only 800 at the other table :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: @SA, small diamond taken by east with the @DQ, spade to the @SJ|pg||
nt|shevek: might run out of entries to dummy if she plays in @d|pg||
nt|athene: you can come to nine tricks by getting either hearts or clubs right|pg||
nt|shevek: exactely|pg||
nt|athene: yes, after the @SJ held in the other room declarer realised that even if she got those diamonds set up, she wasn't necessarily reaching them|pg||
nt|royhughes: It might have been more scientific to bid 4@d and bid more slowly, but sometimes the bash works best|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: A good result for Peake/Richman against Gosney/Gill|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: I probably dont manage ;)|pg||
nt|royhughes: It's hard for NS to get all their tricks against 4S -- -800 might be a fair result|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: the other room of womens went..|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugrapha2: 1@d (1@s) 6@d!|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: yep|pg||
nt|poohbear: I guess Drury isnt popular in Oz|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|poohbear: Drury is 2@c bid by Passed hand over 1M to show 3 + support for the major and a near opening bid|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|shevek: she's doing the right thing here|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|royhughes: North will want to play this carefully, but with hearts 3-2 and diamonds 2-2 it is unlikely to cause her difficulty|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: she might be able to get a count on the hand|pg||
nt|athene: if she can play two rounds of diamonds and cash the @CAK |pg||
nt|athene: leave the hearts to the end|pg||
nt|athene: you will find out east has 5-2-4-2|pg||
nt|athene: of course the @CQ drops then anyway so it will be easy if you kept the @CJ|pg||
nt|athene: but there are ways you might go wrong - for example, you might try to drop the @H10 intending to fall back on the club finesse if it doesn't work|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|athene: so cash @HA, then lead to @HQ|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|athene: and if hearts are unhappy, you cash the @SK and play a club to the @CJ|pg||
nt|athene: but that's the sort of thing you leave right to the end |pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer going for the complete crossruff|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|athene: it looks normal to fiddle around vaguely in diamonds as long as you can|pg||
