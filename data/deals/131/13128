nt|bjacobs: Which is that the Vanderbilt is essentially a stronger event than any of the world championships (except maybe the open Rosenblum Cup)|pg||
nt|gambit: I looked it up this morning, our finalists are from the original seeding  11 (Fleisher),12 (Strul), 15 (De Knijft) and 16 (Zimmerman)  great job to advance to the round of 4 |pg||

mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Fleisher +65 vs Diamond and de Knijff +46 vs Zaleski. Lynch has withdrawn against Strul|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikael_w: In the open room w missed the lead in 3 @s and lead a @s, with a red lead its not posible to make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@S has some chances if you can set up @C in time|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3@s is = if switch to @h after scoring 2 @d's|pg||
mb|4S|nt|chick: 2@D = 11-15, 5@D+4@C  or 6+@D,|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: That 2@s  bid really slowed down W |pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: looks like a push to start with|pg||
nt|gambit: looks like an easy 4@s or 3NT ....|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|bjacobs: For your interest, see http://www.acbl.org/nabc/rosters/2010/01/VANDPRS/ for the entries|pg||

nt|olson: it depends if he uses the entry to finesse the H  or D|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N is fine when the opps clubs are 4-3|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|barnets: thats not so |pg||
nt|barnets: as dec can play the @HJ overtake in hand cash 2 spades and play a third heart|pg||
nt|olson: he can finesse dia Q after H Q holds  and this takes  4/3 diamonds and H offside so should always make|pg||

mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: no strong variety  always weak 2@H or 2@S hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i dont believe|pg||
nt|bjacobs: no, not really ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: only 1 pass|pg||
nt|mikael_w: both 5 @d and 3 nt works for n/s here, even if 5 @d is a way better kontract|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: really?|pg||
nt|gambit: ASECOND SWEATER - WHO PACKS SWEATERS GOING TO rENO?|pg||
nt|mrdct: i would be bidding if i was east|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: me too, but we can see all hands|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: n/s bouncing may well have kept e/w out of a non making game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Weinstein got out for down 1 in 1NX so board 2 was a push|pg||
nt|ady: oh   east is still there|pg||
nt|gambit: some balance|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Marty I could have raised you ?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Vugraphzfd: thank you by Bjorn|pg||
nt|ady: East optimistic when partner could take no action after 2@D opening|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3N is makeable only coz of @c lay and @dA location|pg||
nt|mrdct: with north likely to be very distributional having rebid @H, east will not count on his @CAK standing up|pg||
nt|mikael_w: now N has show 6-5 in red I asume|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: cold but declarer does not know it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Henry Lortz|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|dinos1: 5@d? cd N have @sA @hA @dAK?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: there are 8 tricks  n/s may have problems on the run of the clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Fallenius needs North to hold @HK9 or Q9 to make -- anybody see other play for  9?|pg||
nt|mrdct: looking at east's hand in isolation his partner has acted twice, @S won't be over-ruffed, 3 controls, 10s and 9s and stiff @C - all points towards bidding for me|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: yes 12 is possible|pg||
nt|hlortz: hi all from seattle |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bill must be feeling lonely, he is 18 hours ahead of Martin and Henry|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@D probably weaker than 4@D|pg||
nt|mrdct: nothing to cue|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dinos1: what is 3N/3@h? to play?|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gambit: I will wager E wishes his 6@s was a notch higher, now the forcing def|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bjacobs: It's a very respectable 5 pm here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't quite understand why this is being played in the dead of night in the USA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes, Saturday|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this seems the indicated line to me|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there is no night and day in Vegas|pg||
nt|hlortz: or reno|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: casinos open continuously|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree Bill. They could perhaps have started earlier than 1 pm (13.00)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But there is probably a logical explanation|pg||
nt|mrdct: i guess so|pg||
nt|mikael_w: atleast a sugestion|pg||
nt|dinos1: why not S bid 3N/2@h?|pg||
nt|chick: N could have AAAK but that is the about the only reasonable holding that makes a slam|pg||
nt|dinos1: but N is unlimited|pg||
nt|chick: who was it that said, "if you need a specific hand from me, I don't have it"?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: was 3 diamonds forcing  --- yes |pg||
nt|mikael_w: and with that hand N still have a chanse to deside over 5 @d|pg||
nt|ady: you want South to bid 3NT after 2@H sergey?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: chip talking to himself that this will likely go down|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gambit: misdefence? :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: no, I wd bid 4N as INV to 6@d|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bjacobs: Not just the casinos.  McDonalds, Airport Lounges, Service Stations ... they all have slot machines, right?|pg||
nt|dinos1: w/o side cue|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|mrdct: needs 4-3 @H now|pg||
nt|mrdct: levin declaring 2@h in the open room|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: when playing at casinos which are some distance apart, all the bridge players tend to eat at the tournament hotel|pg||
nt|hlortz: this is the sort of quiet - make game - hand that you like to see when you are 60 ahead :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which causes a huge rush and long waits|pg||
nt|gambit: a normal contract this will go 2 down or so it appears|pg||
nt|mrdct: so probably and imp or two for fleisher|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|dinos1: but for majority 4N is always blkwd|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so they have extra long breaks for dinner|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes slots in rest rooms :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bjacobs: really?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But no couch|pg||
nt|bjacobs: in the toilet cubicles?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gambit: cash the A@D, after two clubs, play a heart down and poof - endplay |pg||
nt|ahollan1: we can see - but will Fallenius find that double dummy??|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
mc|6|nt|gambit: not likely|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|an|a|nt|warrens:  but this guaranteed one overtrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+@D, unbal |pg||
mb|2C|nt|dburn: indeed, but perhaps if South had played a diamond and not a club after ruffing that spade, declarer would not have been able to use @cK|pg||
mb|d|nt|barnets: n/s have t o contend with a 2@C opener by west in other room|pg||
nt|dburn: still, he didn't use it anyway, so no great harm done|pg||
nt|warrens:  this makes 6@S |pg||
nt|warrens:  I mean 5@S|pg||
mb|4C|an|weakish|nt|barnets: i dont think so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C = nice pressure|pg||
nt|warrens:  you think it can't make 5?|pg||
mb|d|an|cards|nt|barnets: well that is easier than 6 certainly|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|dburn: West might have bid 5@c not vulnerable, but 4@c could push his opponents into hearts and not spades - depends what shape South has promised with his double|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|dburn: looks as though he is supposed to have both majors, though|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: in other room e/w are playing 2@D x|pg||
nt|dburn: they probably won't make it|pg||
nt|barnets: i dont think they will make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Wrang 2@C opener same use as Fredin-Fallenius   either a) weak 2@D  b) BAL 20-21  c) str art 2@C opener|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: west asked about 1D before passing |pg||
nt|barnets: west opened 2@C north passed|pg||
pc|cT|nt|barnets: east bid 2@D pp back to north who X and all passed|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
nt|dburn: North-South had obviously done their homework - that double would be takeout for a lot of pairs|pg||
nt|barnets: so the poker champion dknijf is going for a large number|pg||
nt|warrens:  good point David. Some players use an immediate 2@D as a takeout of @D's|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|dburn: very sensible too|pg||
nt|warrens:  this hand just got a lot tougher|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will he take deep finesse of @D now?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, West may not duck a diamond lead, although perhaps he should|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or play for Levin to hold !KH which seems very likely on auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HK|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|barnets: they scored 2@D as down 2 only|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|barnets: seems like a bargain for e/w|pg||
nt|dburn: well, 2@d doubled didn't go as badly as it looked as though it might - 500 will prove a decent save if Fallenius can make this|pg||
nt|olson: 2 d! escaped for 500 |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|d7|nt|dburn: hard to see which six tricks declarer came to, mind you|pg||

nt|mrdct: 4@S runds into a tricky break here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: undo that - need the squeeze|pg||
nt|gambit: both so balanced, not surprised to see 3NT (or more NT) as the final contract|pg||
nt|mrdct: obviously i just got of bed - in 6@C you can of course pitch a @D on a @H and ruff a @D provide trumps behave|pg||

nt|mrdct: but managable|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|chick: easy 6@D, but will they find it missing so many trump honors?|pg||
nt|gambit: what happenned to board 34?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: we are waiting for the result on 34|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C is usually weak with diamonds, so dont think kamil should bid over it|pg||
nt|mrdct: it was flat i think - but this table's score isnt recorded|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: perhaps Bjorn plays them better....|pg||
nt|gambit: weak is the word|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: aha   Fallenius   2N = a) NAT FG  b) PRE @C|pg||
mb|d|nt|gambit: 2NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: it will be difficult to get to 6@C with only an 8 card fit and two balanced hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 3nt in other room|pg||
nt|mrdct: @CAKJ are worthless as it happens|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and its not 100% sure if you make 6 @d, no chanse to play @d to K ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: ? what is 2 diamonds   ------ natural|pg||
nt|gambit: double is fine too |pg||
nt|fabsayc: supposedly NS are provided some standard defense to this opening|pg||
nt|gambit: 3@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: yes they are reading the notes|pg||
nt|mrdct: wrang made 4@h on 34 after east opened a multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I can make 3NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wonder why he chose that route instead of 1@H response :(|pg||
nt|gambit: well this one no page turner in 3 |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Marty thinking|pg||
nt|mrdct: the squeeze in NT is an interesting one in that it will operate against either opponent|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would be too |pg||
nt|gambit: South wants t drive to game, but wants the best fit, will cue bid I hope 3@D|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@D looks to be about 2 down|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double was penalty and he rightly passed|pg||
nt|gambit: Is it Fishbein? |pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: This is quite like a hand from the 2nd set ...|pg||
nt|ady: dont think 6@D can be made without a club lead|pg||
nt|mrdct: perhaps not quite worthless, but some red picture cards woudl eb lot more useful|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and you only have 1 entry to dummy|pg||
nt|mikael_w: so I guess 6 @d is close to ded|pg||
nt|mrdct: is 2@C a weak 2 in a minor?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Wrang looks at Fleisher and he points to his pass card|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if you want to make a takeout of diamonds you bid 2d direct over 2c|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hlortz: 3n rebid showing long solid @C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: classic trick taking 3nt rebid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It seems rather strong for this action|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Helgeness had a long auction with the same result|pg||
nt|dinos1: 2@s - shows stopper?|pg||
nt|gambit: lovely spots for W|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Good Luck|pg||
nt|gambit: perhaps not the best lead|pg||
nt|mrdct: def figure to get 4 trumps and 3 aces|pg||
nt|mrdct: north just needs to avoid being endplayed in trumps|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: as responder you better pull if you cant stop your own bid suit|pg||
nt|chick: well, I spoke too quickly anyway, there is an entry problem to finesse diamonds twice, if no @C lead|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like Helgemo's 2@D reverse better. The hand is too good for 3NT in my opinion|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, I have a fealing this is not a good board to disturb in the bidding for E/W, this migt stop n/s to bid 6 @d to|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: writing but can not see|pg||
nt|gambit: 4 trumps and 2 aces|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: and a heart at least|pg||
nt|gambit: both side will play a forcing game, E must play on clubs|pg||
nt|mrdct: west is going to get tapped so @SA will wind up taking a trick|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: asking 2 of spade in middle of hand = attitude|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bjacobs: totally agree|pg||
nt|dinos1: wrong-sided|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mcphee: no way they play here|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here @h lead is already set|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Lew took out his 6 of diamonds and showed it to Peter|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gambit: nice play by N, little to lose|pg||
nt|mrdct: giving declarer a losing option - always a good plan|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: finger on 3 of hearts|pg||
nt|gambit: but why switch to this suit, E will get it right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: now thinking|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: ]|pg||
nt|mrdct: in my experience declarers don't always get this right|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mcphee: peter will be pleased|pg||
nt|dinos1: result of @c cue - always dangerous|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Vugraphzfd: rusinow lead s t or shortness|pg||
nt|mrdct: so now cash top 3 @H and run the last 2 rounds of  @C|pg||
nt|gambit: that is why they pay us the big bucks - to predict...|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hlortz: yes. rather too much for a direct 3n.. this will make 6 on the @D lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: well at least he did not pass:)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|chick: still a good slam to bid, just unlucky lie of trump|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: showed it to Nystrom I mean  now lots of talking to each other on both side os screen|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Chip is writing now to Peter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Nystrom is talking to Lew|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well. I still think E has demand @h lead|pg||
nt|dinos1: @h lead I guess?|pg||
nt|mrdct: like now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: played over 30 minutes for 3 hands|pg||
nt|mikael_w: The lak of dbl 4 @h is only becuse E dosent want opps to be able to redbl and show first-control|pg||
nt|dinos1: why show same values twice? :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: exactly|pg||
nt|mikael_w: so 2 down if S is trying a finess now, But that would REALY supprise me|pg||
nt|dinos1: first discards|pg||
nt|mcphee: he will play @D to K|pg||
nt|dinos1: so -1|pg||
nt|mcphee: after he takes discards|pg||
nt|ady: useful swing for De Knijff|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'd have thought the indicated line would be win @HA, cash @CAK and @SAK, ruff @S and pull a trump to hand hoping for the best|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, S actually KNOWS W has 6-5 becuse of E preferens 2 @h|pg||
nt|dinos1: cash @cAK  -and ruff what?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: witch also means that he might play on @d 3-0, then he MUST take the @h finess to have a chanse|pg||
nt|dinos1: also dcl knows @s are 6-2|pg||
nt|mcphee: will not have anything left to ruff:)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|gambit: oh! well great play by N |pg||
pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: in fact it always had 11 tricks|pg||
nt|gambit: that was a mistake|pg||
nt|mrdct: now this might really end in tears|pg||
nt|fabsayc: win 8, return king, down 5|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|mikael_w: so 1 down now|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Hi all|pg||
nt|gambit: and deservedly so for such a crappy opener  - if AJ10976 NP |pg||
nt|mrdct: that may not be exactly what transpired at the table|pg||
nt|mrdct: might see a claim of -3 shortly|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps not because 3 makes no sense|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Is that realy posible ? @d6 and N play @d3 ?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@C= a) weak 2@D  b) BAL 20-21 or 25+  c) strong art 2@C|pg||
nt|barnets: Dec should probably cash SA SK and then play hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: if the Q does not fall|pg||
nt|dburn: 20-21? I thought they used it as 19-20 but maybe Fredin has upgraded his hand for no good reason|pg||
nt|ahollan1: treating hand as 20-21 bal --- they count points differently than Walter the Walrus|pg||
nt|olson: he is probably unhappy  about 4 S! down 1 |pg||
nt|warrens:  agreed.  so, in 6, should make 7.  in 7, however, you have to guess, though the percentage play is King first, since it picks up Q9xx with W, but you can't pick up Q9xx with East|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=waiting|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N=20-21|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i bet you are all thinking -- 2@C gained them nothing|pg||
nt|barnets: in 7 i think the best contract may be 7N then you get tto play all the other suits first|pg||
nt|dburn: if you are going to play in seven, you should play in 7NT - cashing the red suits may then help you play spades|pg||
nt|barnets: and count who has the longer spades|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, good point|pg||
mb|3C|an|major|nt|ahollan1: 3@C promises at least 1 4-card major|pg||
mb|d|an|lead direct|nt|warrens:  and you might get it right, since East has 4 @D's and W only 2 and @h's are 4-4|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c gained them nothing on this occasion, but the idea is that if South has a weak hand with one of the majors, he can bid it and play at the two level facing 20-21|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Barry Goren wins the prize -- big win is when they get to play 2@H/@S opposite 20-21 bal|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sorry -- David answer came out while I was typing|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|dburn: of course, it can also enable you to go for a million in 2@d doubled while your team-mate is making a hash of things in 4@s at the other table|pg||

nt|mrdct: 4 of either major must be close here|pg||
nt|gambit: 1H! where s the convention guy?|pg||
nt|mrdct: they haven't really got the values, trump length, trump Q or distribution to bid a grand here|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1@H shows @S i assume|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: yes|pg||
nt|gambit: bet West wishes he had done so already |pg||
mb|4N|nt|ahollan1: Fleisher-Kamil 2@S opening always 8-12|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: Chip we try to get NT on lead|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this does NOT look like a funny kontract to play|pg||
nt|mcphee: well W needs to shift to @C or that loser goes away on @D|pg||

mb|6S|nt|bjacobs: What about West - should he lead a heart?  I think so, even though it's into declarer's suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: North has painted a picture of his singleton or void in hearts|pg||
nt|gambit: New leader|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: everything else has zero appeal|pg||

nt|gambit: what is poor E supposed to lead?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 13 tricks now|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mikael_w: well. a loser might disepeer, but does that matter ? its not like S has unlimited trumph here :)|pg||

pc|s8|nt|mikael_w: Debbie ! Was that discard REALY @cK ?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  1@H      1@S    3@C        3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i cant agree with that but 2c was overly delicate|pg||
nt|dinos1: now @c to Q and K :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: @d9 was not the best discard I think. @c3 would be better|pg||
nt|dinos1: dcl always had 2 @d tricks|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I asume E/W plays UDCA as most swedish pairs does|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: Unfortunately for N-S, Elahmady did not bid 3NT over 3@C. He patterned out with 3@D and that made Sadek bid 3NT|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: 6-1 spade fit plays for 10 tricks    5-3 heart fit does not|pg||

nt|dburn: more technical wizardry at the other table, where East was able to stop in two spades|pg||
pc|h7|nt|barnets: dec has two losing lines in trump and one winning line|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wrang-De Knijff auctions looking very much like Fallenius-Fredin system|pg||

nt|dburn: mind you, we've all been in worse vulnerable games than this one and made them|pg||
nt|olson: 4/1 D! sinks any chance for 4S!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C completely artificial showing either some 16+ or 6+@S with 14-16 HCP|pg||

pc|d7|pc|h2|pg||

nt|mrdct: anothyer slam hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: we are ready to go|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5 of either major on a hook|pg||
nt|mrdct: west would do best to keep quiet in the auction|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|gambit: Tricks are for Kids .....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4+@D unbal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: The child care room is next door and we can hear lots of childred laughing and making lots of noise|pg||
nt|gambit: What can South do other than 1@h?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mrdct: another unpredictable partscore hand?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might get to 3N too|pg||
nt|gambit: So bridge players drop their kids off and go play? Hmmm.....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: lol|pg||
nt|ady: should east become declarer in 3NT   might scramble 9 tricks if guessing Q@C  on an end play |pg||
nt|mrdct: i don't think 3NT will play very well|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Bjorn leaning in and playing with his hair|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H lead, triple hook @D, find @CQ  3N cold :)|pg||
nt|gambit: W looks more like a weak NT than "unbalanced". That you are after a case of Bud at a tailgate party in new Orleans |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: lots of talking between Marty and Peter|pg||
nt|mrdct: however, with a correct guess in @C you do have 8 tricks and a 9th make come if douth leads a @S or a long @D can get setup - problem for the defence is north never gets in to lead ...|pg||
nt|mrdct: the @SQ through|pg||
nt|mcphee: Nystrom thot he just had this hand:)|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3@d vs 3@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|mrdct: that is all predicaded on east being declarer|pg||
nt|gambit: will he or won't he bid 3NT with his QJ@H?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 15 to 16 NT|pg||
nt|gambit: 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: I don't like 2NT for obvious reasons|pg||
nt|mrdct: double fit, lots of controls - i think they will at least make a try for slam|pg||
nt|gambit: 3@H from N?|pg||
nt|mrdct: ironically, if south patterned out to show a stiff @d that would make north upgraded his hand as 4 small is a great holding opposite a singleton|pg||
nt|gambit: checkback maybe|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: wonder if 3@S would be NAT or partial @H stop|pg||
nt|ady: as they lay  if he guesses Q@C    the heart finesse is marked  and likely 6 hearts witth north  so South can be end played in diamonds to give a spade trick|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW will struggle to go plus on this board now|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 3@S   allowed n/s to play 3@D OR|pg||
nt|mikael_w: dont think its easy to come in to the bidding for n/s here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikael_w: why shod 6 @s go down ?|pg||
nt|gambit: S has to pass, N has not shown any strength|pg||
nt|mrdct: i suspect 4@H is signoffish as surely north has other forcing bids he could've made|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Marty is thinking|pg||
nt|gambit: MIGHT try 4@s but risky|pg||
nt|fabsayc: signoff hardly seems consistent with the hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: south's hand has improved now that he knows about the double fit|pg||
nt|mikael_w: OR 6 @h for that matter ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: reaching in box|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mcphee: well they had some toy in open room as S opened 2@C|pg||
nt|dinos1: def can take 1st 8 tricks but only d/dummy - @h, @d back|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: shirley (hmmmm) 3@H forc|pg||
nt|mrdct: difficulty now is that north wont picture the hand with a stiff @D|pg||
nt|gambit: if South has a normal 2NT with Kx of @D then diamond lead could sink it off the top, N should (and will) pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Mike has taken off his glasses|pg||
nt|mrdct: if he's concenred about that he can always go back to @H|pg||
nt|gambit: he can't believe it either, S probably wishing he had not bid 2NT |pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: okay by Bjorn|pg||
mb|6H|nt|gambit: q@S lead will do it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: sorry by Bjorn|pg||
nt|ahollan1: levin-weinstein   1@D-(1@H)-3@H-(P):3N|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: okay by Peter|pg||
nt|ady: might manage down 1  |pg||
nt|mrdct: now he needs to control the damage and guess the @CQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: heart lead please|pg||
nt|mikael_w: so 150 e/w here|pg||
nt|chick: a transfer 2@C to 2@D in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: How do you fancy the defence on that lead?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: worked once, so try it again|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I like it a lot|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He's started killing entries to North|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I (East) should be working the rule of 11 here, but I can't be bothered ...|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes west lead his best suit. well done|pg||
nt|hlortz: smile nod and play the 6 i'd say|pg||
nt|ady: meantime 9 tricks|pg||
nt|gambit: over 3@C, the 3@H, 3@s, all is well....|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: ? clear agreement|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 5 spade and 3 hearts|pg||
nt|gambit: wow|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mrdct: doesnt appear to be a lot of science involved here but they have bid to a making slam so that's all that matters at score-up|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: now want the director here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: thinks break in tempo|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 2nt is slam try|pg||
nt|gambit: and 4S is chopped liver?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I guess the 6@h bid is a little suspect after N thinking for some time before bidding 5 @h|pg||
nt|mrdct: give me a break - every single bid i've seen in this 10 minutes per board event is a break in tempo|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: sent to get director|pg||
nt|gambit: I suppose, does seem a recipe for contention |pg||
nt|mrdct: who called the director east or west?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: east|pg||
nt|mrdct: then EW are out of luck|pg||
nt|gambit: Is hea whiner? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: facts are undisputed clear beat in tempo 2nt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 4s kc blackwood for hearts|pg||
nt|mrdct: if attention is drawn to the BIT by the screenmate it is presumed not to have happened|pg||
nt|gambit: was 2NT alerted as a slam try? I did not see that....|pg||
nt|mrdct: ah the BIT was for the 2NT bid not 5@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2@h was 5+ with short @h|pg||
nt|sybarra: oops wrong room |pg||
nt|mrdct: the important point for people who don't play with screens very often is that attention to the BIT can only be drawn by the opponent on the other side fo the screen|pg||
nt|mrdct: S&W are on one side of the screen|pg||
nt|gambit: and if it was, 4@H had to be a sign off (why not 3@H stillescapes me) so 4@S not counting the optimistic 6@H is questionable|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 4s kcb|pg||
nt|gambit: what would N have bid over 2NT with Axxxx 10xxx xx xx ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Marty picks up hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm at a loss to understand what damage EW could be claiming|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: How many entries do you think your partner has?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, I'm guessing South has @HAK and a spade card, say the king|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and in the minors?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bjacobs: So East really wants to know about that jack and ten of clubs|pg||

nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|bridge_one: sry - big problems with my provider|pg||
nt|mrdct: good point Al - getting the @CQ right doesn't help as it will be at the expense of an extra trump loser|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Peter -- carding is -- Marty standard|pg||
nt|ady: hi Giorgio|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi friends !|pg||
nt|ady: this will be a useful swing for Fleisher|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3NT wrong-sided in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other match just starting to bid this board -- will be interesting to see which trouble they get into|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fallenius best chance -- Kamil started with 14 cards|pg||
nt|ady: yes  had they played 3NT from east hand the swing could have been even worse|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Peter is still thinking|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think J here is his best chance to get out for -1|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 9 imps to Fleisher|pg||

nt|vugraphzff: break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think best defense holds to 11 tricks in @S|pg||
nt|dburn: well, North would have to lead the king of diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: not really|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- isn't final LTT analysis based upon double-dummy play from both sides?|pg||
nt|barnets: how about just not covering the club|pg||
nt|olson: N could duck club Q  and then unblock dia  K|pg||
nt|barnets: and then I said he has to unblock the @D|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - GIB would play a low club and put in the eight unless North split his honours|pg||
nt|barnets: I iddnt think gib was on the team|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right David -- I just noticed Levin's @C8|pg||
nt|olson: GIB would also lead  @D King |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so are we back to 2 trick disparity between total tricks and total trump?|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed it would - good job GIB isn't on the team, really, since it would certainly win the Vanderbilt and everything else|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: smoke break|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: players discussing play @H out|pg||
nt|bjacobs: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: agreement 5 spades 3 heartsw not allow to bid a spade followed by hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: conventions over 2nt could sign off by bidding 3 clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 3 hearts would be forcing|pg||
nt|mrdct: 11 card fits on both sides so this figures to get to high level quickly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 4 hearts is heart and spade hand|pg||
nt|gambit: as it should be |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: limit raise he has to bid 1nt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: has more than limit raise|pg||
nt|gambit: S was nuts, unless he knows something we don't (which I suspect her does) maybe we didn't get those notes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Mike say is unfair i knew if I bid a spade and Marty bid 2 minor treated hand as strong as not to miss a game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: what is 3 hearts GF?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I didn't think about if it was slam try or not a slam try|pg||
nt|gambit: unfair? what was unfair? we are missing a piece of the puzzle...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I did not know the difference between 3 hearts and 4 hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: if you had 7 points he would had bid 2 hearts and not spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: now requesting the notes of the system for the director to read|pg||
nt|mrdct: i still dont see where EW can claim damage - NS had an uninterupted auction to 6@h on a hook and landed on their feet|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: next board and director will make a ruling|pg||
nt|gambit: usually slow arrival (3@H) shows more, fast arrival (4@H) shows lkess and says shut the f ....up |pg||
mb|1S|nt|gambit: please tell me that is not a weak bid |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=10-13 HCP, 6+@S|pg||
nt|mrdct: so two big fits here - NS will compete to at least 5@h - is there a chance of pushing EW into a makable slam though?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 4@S for EW looks reasonable|pg||
nt|gambit: Thx Al|pg||
nt|ady: some would open 3|pg||
nt|mrdct: even if to stop NS find a @H fit, i think east should do something here|pg||
nt|gambit: great to have system expert here, Thx to Al Hollander for that |pg||
mb|4S|nt|gambit: Fleisher if given the room (to show 3H constructive)  will|pg||
nt|mrdct: but non vul opposite a 10-13 limited opener and only a known 6-2 fit game doesn't appear too likely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S blocking|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: thats one way to put it Cam,  the other is "if you go on....at  your peril |pg||
nt|bucheister: not appropriate comments by gambit|pg||
nt|gambit: not if they don't enter the auction |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This is a lot more interesting than the usual commentary, says a spectator|pg||
nt|hlortz: thats the fascination of the game even world class players cant play double dummy... 'errors' are prevalent|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did I open a can of worms I wonder|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Maybe "I" should have opened 2@D (they play weak 2s in diamonds, i think)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Too wild, perhaps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might lose a lot of commentators if the spectators demand we use only one eye|pg||
nt|gambit: double now?|pg||
nt|mrdct: west with the 7th @s might bid 4@s now|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Debbie, when do the TD come with the ruling ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: no great loss|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they did well to find 2@H|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i'd be bidding myself every day of the week with that|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: not a tricky hand they are all laughing|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Vugraphzfd: Bertheau could he have spades|pg||
pc|s8|nt|dinos1: now no guess|pg||

pc|s4|pg||

pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: Closed Room in 3@C -- Fleisher bid 2@S pass/correct instead of Fallenius RDBL|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|barnets: lt looks like a lot of work|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: De Knijff reopened and Wrang settled for 3@C|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
nt|barnets: nice shot|pg||
nt|barnets: by east|pg||
nt|dburn: nice play by Levin - Fallenius suspecting a trap|pg||
nt|dburn: there was a trap, but not the one he suspected|pg||
nt|dburn: however, he may still be OK if he continues spades - declarer may not be able to shut out the nine of hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tap with @S seems best -- but i'm not positive|pg||
nt|barnets: well dec can lead a club from dummy|pg||
pc|s3|nt|barnets: north wins and another spade|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|dburn: he can, but when North wins that and plays a third round of spades, that may be enough|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|barnets: promotes a second trump trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right that @H9 looks powerful|pg||
nt|dburn: dummy's trump spots are needed to ruff diamonds, and declarer's six isn't up to the job|pg||
nt|barnets: ion the thrird spade by north dec ruffs the Q and south pitches a club|pg||
nt|dburn: in fact, the spots may not matter - it's just the fact that East has to ruff the third spade with something, and South has a long heart, not necessarily a high one|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|dburn: hello Kit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe play for South to hold original   Kx in both blacks?|pg||
nt|barnets: hi kit|pg||
nt|olson: hi|pg||
nt|barnets: of course in the local club if south overruffed with the @HK dec would be home|pg||
nt|dburn: could be crucial, this - if Levin can bring this home somehow, Fleisher will have a significant lead in the match, and even with 23 boards to go, that might be decisive|pg||
nt|barnets: but Fallenius wont do that|pg||
nt|dburn: if not, the margin will be back to 12 IMPs and the match will still be wide open|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like South will get to discard a club when North gets in and leads a spade, and declarer won't be able to survive that|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|c3|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|barnets: well thats a quick result|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - looks as though Levin decided that his best chance was just to play North for @hK, but he wasn't out of the woods even then|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: 59 min for 9 board|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|mrdct: debbie, on that ruling hand just so i have this straight are EW saying the break in tempo was 2NT not any other bid?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: correct|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ohh ok|pg||
nt|mrdct: but east can't call a break in tempo on his own screenmate|pg||
mb|d|nt|bjacobs: You know, even if this doesn't take off, I think when I'm looking at VuGraphs (not commentating), I might just take the best player at the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 14-16|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: rooting that you would not x|pg||
nt|gambit: 5H was a break, or so it seemed at the time, maybe our Vug operator was subject to the Sominex Coup |pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N=PUP 3@C  a) weak @C  b) INV+, 6+@D  c) FG, 6+@C, some shortness|pg||
nt|gambit: xfer?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: alert some clubs|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this looks like a solid 3 NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pass or correct|pg||
nt|gambit: Which of course might render 6H subject to adjudication |pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@h ceases to be a BIT if its screenmate draws attention to it first|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: A danger hand I can reveal, Bill|pg||
nt|ady: they have caught up last 2|pg||
mb|d|nt|bjacobs: East should be thinking about his lead here |pg||
nt|bjacobs: to 6@S perhaps ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's an unpleasant thought.  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 3@H now -- showing shortness|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I promise not to tell that South has less spades than you|pg||
nt|dburn: fewer|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'd probably open a weak 2 in @h on the north hand|pg||
nt|gambit: lots of undos |pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think I take a ciggarett on this hand :) if nothing els then 3 NT = or +1 I will be supprised when I come back :)|pg||
nt|chick: they may still be bidding by the time Mikael gets back :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: looking at notes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: for defense|pg||
nt|mrdct: i find it quite amusing that they allow written defences at the table in this event|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: need version of option 2 |pg||
nt|gambit: well I guess the tempo (or lack thereof) will come into play - if the match is close and DK loses, I would expect an appeal ( not brazen enough to predict the outcome) |pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Mr Pedant returns!  (Don't you hate it when he's right?)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We all do|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, can you have "fewer" than one?|pg||
nt|dburn: er,,, yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: David is BBO's language policeman|pg||
nt|hlortz: meanwhile do you like 3n? i am more inclined to raise on the void...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: dont like either the raise or 3nt|pg||
nt|gambit: pass?|pg||
nt|mrdct: no problems in 3NT here - but should north be getting involved in teh auction at these colours with 5-5 in the reds?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: lots of writing|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: maybe he wants to show short spades?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be 3@s giving shortness in @h to not give the possibility to dbl at opps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe they use steps for shortness|pg||
nt|mrdct: fredin having vague thoughts of a slam in @C?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: LMH  would be 3@H=short @D  3@S=short @H  3N=short @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: Bjorn, 3NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: that incline must be one heck of a tilt|pg||
nt|bjacobs: no entries, huh?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the crux is does 3@S show a truely solid suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Except maybe this one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @D10 is an entry :)|pg||
nt|gambit: W will bid 3@C (hopefully in tempo) |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: he should have something|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gambit: was W's pass forcing?|pg||
nt|mrdct: this would usually be a lebensohl situation|pg||
nt|mrdct: but maybe their written defence doesnt mention lebensohl|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think so david|pg||
nt|gambit: yes, does W have enough for 3@c (constructive) no, so he should try 2NT, puppet to 3C |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: leads 3/5|pg||
nt|mrdct: you dont think it's normal to play lebensohl after a t/o double of a weak 2?|pg||
nt|gambit: leads, singleton....|pg||
nt|gambit: yes, of course|pg||
nt|gambit: leb is my favourite convention |pg||
pc|hA|nt|bridge_one: if West can't reopen impossible to have 12 tricks - right bid 3NT|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@H is probably quite a good save for NS|pg||
nt|gambit: 10 toppers|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: As Pierre Schmidt points out, West will have to give the entry later anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: how did 4@S go down 2 in closed room|pg||
nt|gambit: very tough for N to climb in at the 3 level, I doubt many would venture in, even at these colours or (heaven help us) Matchpoints|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: fourth best leads|pg||
nt|ady: must have been|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|gambit: sure looks like it...|pg||
nt|dinos1: depends what was X - GF? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: was alerted|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gambit: poor communication |pg||
nt|mrdct: going for a x-ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is not in the written defense, which merely covers whether bids are takeout or penalty|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|mrdct: so south will want to win this and play a trump|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|s2|pc|h2|pg||

pc|c6|pc|h6|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however 4@h was a good defence|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|bjacobs: For what it's worth, East should know the entire layout now, except for the precise diamonds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't suppose it's possible that West can refuse to get endplayed with a diamond?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'll shut up ... the comment makes no sense for those who can see all 4 hands|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good point and he can|pg||
nt|dinos1: A=3, K=2, Q=1 zz|pg||
nt|ady: can make 12 tricks  cash all minors and put north in with spade|pg||
nt|gambit: feeling noose tighten already |pg||
nt|mrdct: or not|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mrdct: south can overruff @s so declarer isnt home free yet|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if defense 1 in use, double= takeout of spades, and may include a direct lebensohl|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: use defense   2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense 2 is mostly natural and Lebensohl not mentioned|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think i like defence 1 better|pg||

pc|d2|pc|s7|pc|d3|pg||

nt|hlortz: blackwood with a worthless dbltn frowned on in some circles|pg||
pc|c9|nt|gambit: 3NT too greedy without a filler in @d, but it makes the worlk go round and on a beter day the K@D would be on-side|pg||

nt|mikael_w: a good lead for n/s, I think 10 tricks was posible without @d lead|pg||

nt|dburn: not sure that it matters much|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: he was given 1435 as one of the hand types and 3+5 leads throughout|pg||

nt|kit: Anyway, North appears to have worked it out.|pg||

nt|mikael_w: here it looks like n/s has a tough 4 @h, but a 300 sac in 5 @d for e/w|pg||
nt|mrdct: i wonder if that is a systemic 1NT opeing|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|mrdct: so after trailing 0-17, dekniff have racked up 28 imps in 3 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I double for takeout??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=INV+ RELAY|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: 1N=bal  11-13 or 17+|pg||
nt|gambit: 28 imps on 3 hands....|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: no top loser in spades   but on 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=11-13|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: So did Helness but ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: different auction, though|pg||
nt|mikael_w: now it looks imposible to find the 5@d tho,|pg||
nt|dinos1: what's good in 5@d?|pg||
nt|mrdct: surprise surprise - i open 1NT with a singleton and partner transfers to it|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: now i have to scan notes :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: your right, maybe its 500 in 5 @d|pg||
nt|dinos1: wrong vul for it|pg||
nt|dinos1: @sA and @c fin|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 2nd and 4 best|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: fourth best attitude|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: no ruling|pg||
nt|mrdct: good to hear that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: probably will be after the 3rd quarter break|pg||
nt|mrdct: i assume "no ruling" means table result stands|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: no have not made ruling|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mrdct: oh i see|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: unless finessing hearts|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mikael_w: it means TD has not say anything yet|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mrdct: got it|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dinos1: better deep one)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|gambit: got to be tempted for a grand with the E hand after partner opens and fit is found, tough to stay out |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: lots of writin gby fredin|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can make 13 tricks also without finesse in @h|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Vugraphzfd: Bjorn sits up straight in chair|pg||
nt|gambit: can he trade the K@D for the Q@H?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ruffing 2@C and 1@d|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes 7@S looks makable|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but need to play seeing all cards :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 7@S in other room|pg||
nt|mrdct: i doubt this hand will be over before the top of the hour|pg||
nt|gambit: 7@s made there too wd |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 53 minutes on clock|pg||
nt|ady: I think 7 spades likely to go down   |pg||
nt|gambit: Tell that to Levin |pg||
nt|mikael_w: there is a risk that w plays a low @s now|pg||
nt|mcphee: he will need to finesse in @C again to bring this home if they find @D tap|pg||
nt|dinos1: now if def tap dcl with @d's and he tries ruff @c - W will put @h10|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: i'm not positive if exact shape known or just 4@S & 2@H|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mrdct: on what line david?|pg||
nt|ady: what line do you make it?|pg||
nt|mrdct: dummy reversal|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 7@S is very hard, but at the table can be made|pg||
nt|chick: W is not listening to you :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: ic :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bridge_one: with lead @s i think he will make|pg||
nt|mrdct: 9 top tricks here - but that will be about it i think|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrdct: in the other room north bid 1@H which guided the play somewhat|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Peter now sits up|pg||
nt|gambit: No shyness here....|pg||
nt|mikael_w: there was a verry light opening from S. so you have to understand w for thinking @dK is in S hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bjacobs: Seriously, how do you guys play a double of 4@S in that auction?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The 4@S opening, I mean, not the overcall|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|gambit: Will S lead a trump? I think so |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Pete says he has show 4 2 3 4 without Q of clubs|pg||
nt|mrdct: well there's no point leading a singleton to get a ruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Have i shown a maximum?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D lead looks most troublesome  but   is it a reasonable lead?  all depends upon what Fleisher knows about Fredin's shape|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: was told 4 2 3 4|pg||
nt|bridge_one: there are also the chance to play a double squeeze ruffing 2 @H in the dummy|pg||
nt|mrdct: might be able to scrounge an extra trick in @S but I think he'll run for the border|pg||
pc|h8|nt|fabsayc: primarily penalty|pg||
nt|dinos1: well - S has only 10pc so @dK is rather in his hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes, and sadly his @S spots are not very strong|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Lew says ruffing|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: thanks Debbie|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bjacobs: I'm a takeout doubler myself, and it seems to me that Krekorian's hand was neither fish nor fowl|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And was therefore a pass (opposite a passed partner)|pg||
nt|mrdct: of course he doesnt know @C are breaking yet|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: have you played yet  no will play the jack eventually every one laughs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: lost 3 tricks?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: yes|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|hlortz: mostly penalty . yes his hand seemed neither|pg||
nt|mrdct: he's not going to endplay anyone now|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: yes  I agree squeeze can do it|pg||

mb|1N|an|a|nt|ahollan1: 1N=RELAY, FG|pg||
nt|dburn: decent result for de Knijf at the other table - North-South could even make a slam with a good view in diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: A good example hand showing the value of getting in that opening bid|pg||
nt|barnets: dekniijff still playing poker opened 1@S in east hand|pg||
nt|mikael_w: in closed room it started pass,pass and De Knijff opend 3:rd hand 1 @s. that was a well timed Psych for sure :)|pg||

nt|dburn: this is all artificial - South is asking questions and North is answering them|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: i think 2@C=4@H|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not sure about the rest of the relays :(|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|mikael_w: lol @@ Kit|pg||

nt|mikael_w: will be intresting to see what hand will be dec i 6@h|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|mikael_w: its alot better in S hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N was equal shortness  [11, 22]   3@D=5@D 4@H 22, 11-13 HCP|pg||
nt|barnets: the 4-0 heart split wont help dec|pg||
nt|kit: yes, as West may well lead a fatal diamond|pg||
mb|d|nt|mikael_w: but this Dbl over 5@c helped def alot|pg||
nt|kit: aha -- now will get a club lead from either side -- and I don't think it will make on a club lead|pg||
nt|barnets: I am informed nunes made 6@H|pg||
nt|barnets: by taking a first round @D finesse|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and for thoose that only has watch this table I must tell you there is a TD ruling in the other room|pg||
nt|barnets: passing the @D 9|pg||
nt|barnets: that seems a great shot|pg||
nt|kit: and if 9 of diamonds gets covered?|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed|pg||
nt|barnets: must be able to see thru the backs of the cards|pg||
nt|mikael_w: on board 39 that is|pg||
nt|kit: of course, covering 9 of diamonds would be pretty bad if East had stiff 10|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|dburn: better play in 6NT, I guess - then you can take your percentage shot in diamonds without losing the heart entries to the North hand|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|fann4: then why would declarer lead the 9 from A9x?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: aha  3@S sets @H as trump|pg||
nt|kit: they sure would be happy to stop in 5@H if they knew the result at the other table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's it -- i'll leave the rest to the relay police|pg||
nt|barnets: strul has fought back to only down 15 now|pg||
nt|barnets: gaining 13 imps on the slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: how many green cards remain in EW boxes??|pg||

pc|h2|pc|s2|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will play a trump, but when he sees the bad split he will have to re-think things|pg||
nt|kit: now he can't just draw trump, as if he then misguesses diamonds defense can take 2 clubs|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|s5|pg||

nt|gambit: what line did they take in the other room? Spade led?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Mike says luckier at the other table|pg||
nt|Walddk5: There is no double squeeze on a diamond lead. Helness got one in the other match. 7@S-1 was flat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Weinstein finished pulling trump, then hooked @H!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: good not to lead a heart|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: how many spades Marty   three|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: oh -- De Knijff overcalled 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+@D unbal|pg||
nt|gambit: North bid hearts DavPro tells me - well, that changes things just a little, another lesson, sometimes, certainly that hand, silence is golden |pg||
nt|mrdct: on the face of it this looks like game in either major for NS - but both majors break 4-1 so it might be tricky|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dinos1: lucky 4@s|pg||
nt|ady: nice lay for 4@S e/w|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrdct: 4@H for NS but EW may compete to 4@S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: I think 2@H just LR+|pg||
nt|mrdct: with a 10 card @D fit, EW likely to save in 5@D|pg||
nt|mrdct: which is a great save given that it makes|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here 4 @s is even playable|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@S by west right now not unreasonable|pg||
mb|d|nt|mikael_w: not easy to find in the bidding tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: EW might have snookered themselves though as NS might have bid to a failing 6@H contract left to their own devices|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Gazilli reaches the United States!  Excellent|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think it would be made if bid|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: might not get to game|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: in a dubious version, west hand is 2s bid|pg||
nt|dinos1: i wd say impossible)|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s only has 3 losers but the def will play @SA and another at some point to cut down the ruffs|pg||
nt|mikael_w: This looks like a realy well timed psyk|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but they have made it their own by omitting one  z|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mrdct: trump lead best|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: Mr Pedant went to sleep, so I have taken over|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are there 11 tricks?|pg||
nt|gambit: N bid 1@H over 1@c with his x Q9xxx Q9xxx xx, (last hand) - giving a blueprint to the opps, serves them right |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Mike this game is too Hard|pg||
nt|mrdct: they seem very chatty at this table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fleisher @DJxx complicates the play|pg||
nt|gambit: Sometimes I think we fail to appreciate how well these players play, it is a treat to watch |pg||
nt|ady: also doubleton club|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So the idea behind Gazilli is that after 1major 1NT (and other auctions), 2@C is either clubs or a strong hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i assume west actually bid 2d or 2s, not 3@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 3@D was the bid|pg||
nt|mrdct: looking at 6@h again - it may well make|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: That's not real Gazzilli then|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Typically, the lowest unbid suit in response shows the top of the 1NT range, and commits to game if opener has the strong hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S would be the bid|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|bjacobs: Yes, no idea what 3@D means|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Less than 8, usually 2 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still no @D shift should help Fredin read the hand|pg||

nt|dinos1: for 3N shd have @c suit headed with AQJ at least|pg||

pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: this looks best, then discard spade on club return|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The only question mark is de Knijff (Sweden), but they were 46 up going into the last 16|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: nope 4th :(|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Mike says he is thinking about the whole hand now|pg||
pc|c9|nt|gambit: K@S|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ady: take the 6 tricks and next hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gambit: which is why W had no urgency to unblock|pg||
nt|mrdct: but instead he's chosedn to supress his @DK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can make on complete cross ruff|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mikael_w: soo, 3 down|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mrdct: he will also shortly discover that north has no @C so he'll play north for longer @H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kamill must discard a diamond now to give any problem|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Mike says sorry|pg||
nt|mrdct: awkward discard for north here - @D will mean @DJ sets up and @S will mean he wont be able to cash an established @S|pg||
nt|mrdct: @D does look his best option|pg||
nt|mrdct: news on brd 43 from the other room is that levin is going for a big number in 1NTx|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h5|pc|c7|pg||

nt|mrdct: there they are|pg||
nt|mrdct: am i allowed to say that this match is on a knijff's edge?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: and the blade is a little dull right now with the slow play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: save the good material for board 64|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: but the tension can be cut|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|h8|nt|mrdct: score in the other semi is 29-18 to zimmerman|pg||

pc|s4|nt|mikael_w: for another 9 IMP to sweden|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|dburn: weird-looking bidding at the other table|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikael_w: I think 2 @c showed 4+@h and 6+@c|pg||
nt|dburn: then 3@h merely aggressive rather than weird|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome from the other room Mikael|pg||
nt|dburn: but 5@h so super-aggressive as to be classed as weird anyway|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mikael_w: thanks Al :) nice to be here :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if not expecting to beat 4@S -- doesn't 5@H just risk 2 [down 3] vs gain 3 [down 2]|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|dburn: no great harm done, because 4@s will certainly make, but matches have been lost by 2 IMPs before, and this one has been close all the way|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: Fleisher by 42 in other quarters|pg||

nt|dinos1: uc - there was rebid 2@c in OR - and EW have bought 2@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: why did he not play q of diamonds Nystrom  I was in control|pg||
nt|gambit: No ned, had the A@C , could bide his time |pg||

nt|mrdct: the dealing machine has done very well this set|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@S my prediction|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|Vugraphzfd: 3 card spade support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S min with 3@S?|pg||
nt|dinos1: why not open 1N?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: looks like 3 NT will make here |pg||
nt|gambit: 1C? does that violate system?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 1 @d might have been a try to avoid @d lead|pg||
nt|dinos1: ok, what's 2N rebid then?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: south is explaining what 2 clubs|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@Cx will be too expensive|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: ach Debbie got there 1st|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think so - with 4 probably 2@s|pg||
nt|mrdct: but quite a few world champions in those teams seeded relatively lowly|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D look like a suit with raise in @h|pg||
nt|gambit: it might if N was on lead (which he is) |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: now south is shaking his head|pg||
nt|mrdct: meanwhile on 44 in the open room where EW found the superb save in 4@Sx, the uninterupted auction is well on the way to 6@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: tray will now be sent|pg||
nt|mrdct: feisty 3@H bid|pg||
mb|4H|nt|chick: no, one of the choices for 1D is 4441|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mrdct: the seeding system doesn't seem to have worked out a good way to rate the foreign players - but attaching some seeding points to bermuda bowl medals woudl be a good start|pg||
nt|gambit: 44-1-4?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: spade lead gives defence some chance|pg||
nt|chick: 2N = max with 4@Hs|pg||
nt|gambit: what will N lead? 2@S?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Bertheau I have 16 highs|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this is a tough game, but the @cK makes it with @c 3-2|pg||
nt|ady: would seem 4 clubs 3 diamonds and 2 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: the tried and true 4th best, tough to argue |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: leads = attitude|pg||
mb|5H|nt|fabsayc: you agree Bill?|pg||
nt|mrdct: slam has two big problems here - the black aces|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Bjorn is sitting up straight now|pg||
mb|d|nt|bjacobs: I was going to type "East has nowhere to go"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with 5c|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I would have passed and led @SJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: rightly or wrongly|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sure minus this way|pg||
nt|gambit: undo?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4nt ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: thought respond key card in Diamonds?|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4NT will struggle on a @C lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Peter my lead|pg||
nt|gambit: will struggle on any lead.....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Peter looking at ceiling and pulls out card then returns card now is |pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: so what went wrong here for NS?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: thank you by Marty|pg||
nt|dinos1: has 2@h tricks now|pg||
nt|ady: dont think you need clubs 3-2  just king onside   can even overtake K@D to set up 3 diamond tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|bridge_one: a misunderstand about 3@d|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Vugraphzfd: upside down count  diamond attitude|pg||
nt|mrdct: at least 3 off here for -500|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gambit: Clearly N assumed natural, while S intended other....|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|gambit: 4 down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: it happen|pg||
nt|dinos1: after setting 2@h tricks dcl can sqz S in @s-@d|pg||
nt|mrdct: so probably a couple of imps to DK - the 4th undertrick will pay well|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||

mb|1H|nt|barnets: except 5@H could easily have gone down 4 on different splits|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|barnets: with only a 4-4 poor trump fit|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|dburn: oh, certainly it could - declarer did pretty well to assemble eight tricks as it was|pg||
nt|olson: 6 @S is a nice result from the other room |pg||
nt|barnets: yes|pg||
nt|barnets: declarer has to play it carefully|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mikael_w: yep, and that shows how close this match are, missed slam now and its only 4 IMP again|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if 3@C [4th suit] - 4@C would be a delayed splinter for @S|pg||
nt|barnets: i think 3N is a very lazy bid by north|pg||
nt|olson: perhaps,  but he was  1 / 2 in partners suits and had clubs well stopped |pg||
nt|barnets: lazy is when you dont look for a better contract|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I know Fredin likes to take some points of from his hand when he has 1-2 in partners suits|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|barnets: surely 3@c would work well here|pg||
nt|olson: y|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and nothing wrong with that for sure, but this time it turns out sadly|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||

nt|mrdct: meanwhile the auction on 44 in the open room is progressive at a rate of 1 bid every 2 or 3 minutes|pg||
nt|mrdct: so breaks in tempo there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: one of the better accidents you have erver hand and laughs around the table|pg||
nt|mrdct: *no i meant|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No mercy from Helgemo-Helness in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting point is initial DBL -- is it Takeout [of @H] or @H??|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They did very well to penalise 2@C with just five between them, divided 3-2|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bjacobs: They must have ... East doubled the runout ... once again, takeout or penalties?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well at worst they would chalk up -180, so not that risky|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: primarily penalty, very old fashion of me|pg||
nt|bjacobs: dreadfully :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I guess you are 90% sure @CQ is a trick, so as you point out, it's going to be -180 at worst, and with your easy lead, you are quite likely to beat it|pg||
nt|mrdct: barry goren opines, 3@h would have been 100% forcing so 4@h showed a mountain and @s bid KC. No way 4NT can be corrective|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|Walddk2: I don't think Michel's pass is conventional|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It isn't|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after the raise in @s by East the dbl became for all table @h suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: Yes it does, even Tiger doesn't hit a hole in one on all the par threes - mistakes happen, and you have to stay out of the sand traps and water and hit the greens in regulation, ...|pg||
nt|gambit: sometimes you whack it into the forest or the pond. s**t happends and a new leader. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if 2@C=trf @D or like Gazzilli|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt now ?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: sure not gazzilli|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: writing explantion of what is 2clubs but I can not read it from here|pg||
nt|gambit: redouble?|pg||
nt|ady: this an easy 4@S|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@H the contract on 44 so 7 or 8 imps coming for DK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they stopped in 5@H on board 45|pg||
mb|4S|nt|gambit: This is for the VuGraph commentators: "There are three right plays in bridge - what is correct in analysis, what works and what I would have done."|pg||
nt|mikael_w: guess 2 @h is GF, nice and easy bidding then to show distrub.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6@S here?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|bridge_one: if 2@C is long @D i think 3Nt correxct with AJxx|pg||
nt|gambit: wow! |pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: These strong notrumps are just too dangeours|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Still, a minor runout is worth considering|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Casen 4th best!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: table chuckled|pg||
nt|janm: 2@d showed either 6 spades or a minimum 5(332) hand, 2@h asked, 2@s showed 6 spades|pg||
nt|dinos1: and what was 2@d?)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: undo|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4NT for minors or by north more likely|pg||
mb|5H|mb|6S|nt|Vugraphzfd: more writing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: common treatment when 2@C=2+ and 1@D=4+ UNBAL  is to play transfer rebids by opener|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c redoubled was probably going to make|pg||
nt|gambit: ok, that is better|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dinos1: good contract in MP/BAM|pg||
nt|ady: spade contract a little better|pg||
nt|janm: 2@c was game forcing, but might have longer diamonds|pg||
nt|mrdct: this looks cold as ice|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: The entry to double finesse clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: spade is an entry??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless West ducks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But partner gave me an encouraging spade card at trick 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: @D is an entry too|pg||
nt|hlortz: unless casen plays pard for k108 he ought to duck|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh I see, declarer has AK10 or AQ10 ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: AK10|pg||
nt|hlortz: very good :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: @C Kx on side|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many ask about gazzilli 2@C - the 2@C gazzilli is played only after 1Maj open to give any strong hand or natural 12/16 with @c|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@C by west, therefore, probably wont make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that fits the auction perfectly -- and IS played by Fredin-Fallenius|pg||
nt|dinos1: why better? 3N by N is best|pg||
nt|mikael_w: will @c lead not end up only 630 ?|pg||
nt|ady: spades almost certainly 11 tricks   no-trump might be only 10|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: south is to have extras|pg||
nt|mrdct: ah - i had the vul wrong on 44 - new leader!|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Vugraphzfd: Peter this is bad news but is better not red|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: And next comes a diamond up|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 1@D open the gazzilli isn't used - here 2@c have for sure a means, but i don't think similar at gazzilli layout|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bjacobs: Now I'm totally lost.  Declarer won @SA?  I guess I'm tired.  64 boards in a day ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: was perfectly safe, Bill|pg||
nt|mrdct: what a fantastic match we have here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart lead would have made it tougher|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Last chance to beat it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Specs tell me I am being tempted into continuing spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bill?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, I've got several 100 wires here :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well what is it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think I'm meant to switch to hearts ... but I'm not sure I can find that in real life|pg||

nt|olson: the hand easier to count when he knows  @D 6/1 after the @H switch|pg||
nt|dburn: intelligent lead - when partner passes out 1@d and you have as little as North has, South must have a hefty diamond stack, or he would have bid|pg||
nt|olson: nite |pg||
pc|d6|pc|s3|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: fredin @HQ probably trying to create entry to Fallenius for 2nd @D -- but is that better than @Hx in longrun?|pg||

nt|fabsayc: well after yesterday's blowouts, may have two buzzer beaters today|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|ahollan1: before we forget -- great job from our vugraph operator Debbie Hyatt !!|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Final hand of the final set for the day.  A big well done to our fine operator John Schwartz.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: thx all|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And thanks to my fellow commentators, Martin, Roland and Henry, along with English language specialist David Burn|pg||
nt|mrdct: just need to drop the stiff @SK offside to make game here|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: dble by E was silly, if undiscusssed as to length, as W 's bidding suggrdtd|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, this time e/w lost 2 IMP, next time they will push n/s to 3 @d and win 4 IMP|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bjacobs: Finally, our appreciation to the ACBL, in particular Jeff Johnston and Jan Martel for broadcasting this prestigious event. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: In just over 12 hours, the semi-finals commence|pg||
nt|hlortz: ah yes and the tireless Roland Wald who puts this show together|pg||
nt|bjacobs: tireless, and as far as I can tell, sleepless|pg||
nt|mikael_w: soo, this is the last board of this set, I guess the time will be same as the days before. Then we will have a break for about 1 hour and 45 min|pg||
nt|gambit: ty to the player, our VuG operator, commentators and of course most importantly - the specs -  next session approx 1 hour away. Is that about right? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: will restart probably at 8:00pm PST|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I may go for a kip now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need to find K sgl out |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I will confirm|pg||
nt|mikael_w: that is in 1 hour and 53 min from now right ?|pg||
nt|gambit: 11:00 pm EST last night so 60 _51 minutes|pg||
nt|gambit: + |pg||
nt|chick: except that we are now on EDT and PDT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: well is 6:08 pm here|pg||
nt|mikael_w: http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2010/01/vanderbilt/|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@s? :)|pg||
nt|gambit: 9:08 here|pg||
nt|mrdct: hard for west to act again here vul and a passed partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 20 mins or so|pg||
nt|bjacobs: powernap|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So, Zimmermann vs Strul and de Knijff vs Fleisher in the semi-finals|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In exactly 12 hours from now|pg||
nt|ady: unless n/s can make 4@S  dropping sing King  looks like De Knijff will retain  a small lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikael_w: Here is a link to this tourney if you want to check the IMPs before next set starts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 8:00 pm will restart here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: intermediate bid|pg||
nt|mrdct: west endplayed already|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: double here just keeps auction alive, i.e. takeout|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bjacobs: It's hard to commentate on this auction.  2@S ... was that a splinter?  Or some other form of raise?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: forcing raise i think|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: to game, with 2nt as the limit raise, but just a guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: four rounds of hearts (eventually) will make this interesting|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: good 12 to bad 16 and 6 card suit|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bjacobs: So, enough of science, wheel out Old Trusty|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|nt|mikael_w: Thx to my fellow comentators and to all kibz and special thanks to Debbie for a great job as usual|pg||
nt|dinos1: why not direct 4@s then?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mikael_w: I know 3 @d was home this time, But NEXT time its not that sure|pg||
nt|mrdct: if south was declarer and hadn't disclosed such @S length, you could work on the theory that if @SJ isn't covered the K is offside and then play for the drop - but with J109 in ...|pg||
nt|mrdct: dummy that theory wont work|pg||
pc|h8|nt|gambit: declarer will guess the spades (after all the red suit bidding by W) and quickly append 420 to his side of the balance sheet |pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: best line on this lead, suggestions?|pg||
nt|po-s: finesse trumps...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart finesse, or heart ace and go for discards|pg||
nt|hlortz: on the bidding @D are 6-1 so no worries|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|bjacobs: Yes, and the @D3 confirms it|pg||
nt|hlortz: take the @H finesse|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So hook the heart without a care in the world|pg||
nt|po-s: still|pg||
nt|ady: just needs to get spade right   should do on the auction|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rabbi Rule rarely applied when appropriate|pg||
nt|gambit: TY to the players (fabulous bridge) the specs (wonderful silence), the VuG operator, (just plain great) and the commentators, hope you smiled, next session is (?) not ...|pg||
nt|gambit: sure....enjoyed, hope you all did too |pg||
nt|mrdct: happy to keep west on lead|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|gambit: 8@S from E on the low to the K@S|pg||
nt|mikael_w: maybe not if S thinks W has stiff @c and only 5-5 in red|pg||
nt|gambit: Lew will get it right |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Does that change anything? East is a big favourite to have spade length|pg||
nt|ady: chance for Fleisher   4@S -1 in OR|pg||
nt|dinos1: shape wasnt shown in OR|pg||
nt|dinos1: Weinstein showed only @d suit|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Thanks to all spectators for watching. We hope you enjoyed the show and that you will be back in about 12 hours|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Cheers all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bye for now|pg||
nt|hlortz: and to all a good night|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i want a no blowout or refund clause :), good night all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: could have made it|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok, see you all when next set starts,|pg||
nt|ady: that the last  of the set?|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes - great work by debbie. particular relaying the comments being made by the players|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: yes|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great set -- Debbie please thank the players for us|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: okay|pg||
nt|gambit: thx Al H, super job |pg||
nt|mrdct: the next set is fairly soon i believe - with the meal break between the 2nd and 3rd segments|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I have found out that next set prob will start in about 15 min|pg||
nt|gambit: not much of a break....|pg||
nt|gambit: cheers to all |pg||
nt|ahollan1: next set scheduled to begin in 20 minutes -- but teams can restart whenever they want|pg||
nt|bridge_one: THX ALL for Wothching|pg||
nt|mrdct: if these guys played anywhere remotely close to 7.5 minutes per board they would get ample time for breaks and get to bed before midnight|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c6|pc|dT|pg||
mc|9|nt|mrdct: overtrick with beer card|pg||
nt|mrdct: thx to all the usual suspects|pg||
nt|mrdct: most importantly our great opertor debbie|pg||
pg||
