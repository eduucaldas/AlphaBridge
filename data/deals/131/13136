nt|othered1: negative action.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Point of technique here. You should cash @DQ first. You can only handle a 4-0 break if North has them all|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: The Hideous Hog is playing in the closed room?|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 2@C = 10-13 with clubs, if you call that a suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@S = constructive, with spades|pg||
nt|othered1: Hard to believe you can get away with 2@C on that fine suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Heleness-Helgemo, probably would be proud|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kiwibridge: that is the worst 2@C I ever saw|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: but they have methods and likely couldn't pass without denying that count and shape or open 1|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: that is correct, for sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: yes I agree ed, a compulsory system opening|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The two level openings are the most damaging part of the Fantunes system.  But yes, very occasionally, it results in self-inflicted damage|pg||

nt|othered1: 3 or 4, depending on north's play to this trick|pg||

nt|rodal f: Non of them surpriced me. Some might remember Zimmerman in Rio.|pg||
nt|sharkey: hard to seed when you look at the start list|pg||

pc|s6|nt|sharkey: On the two tables in this match the US players are not present|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|kareno: Yes, ACBL needs to account for some of the foreign teams which have had good results elsewhere.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Four world champiuons this table|pg||
nt|panja: the problem is how do you assess 'good results elsewhere'?|pg||
mc|10|nt|hlortz: perhaps give weight to wbf rankings|pg||

nt|bjacobs: And the positive response to 2@C is always the cheapest bid in a suit not yet shown|pg||
nt|othered1: OK, I'll stand corrected.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, 2@D = 0-6, diamond preference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes Bill, but it's not classical Gazzilli as Ed said. It's their own extension as Gazzilli was only designed for major openings|pg||

nt|bjacobs: If North happens to return a spade, it might be necessary to ruff with the 10 or Q?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: In fact, if a trump comes back, he doesn't need diamonds 3-3 as long as South has @DKQ. He will be squeezed if he has more than three|pg||
nt|dinos1: disc @c?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Club pitch also works, giving him transportation.  Right now, he's wondering precisely how the hearts divide|pg||
nt|othered1: He has to ruff this with an honor.|pg||
nt|othered1: as the cards lie|pg||
nt|dinos1: @c is better - hardly N had stiff @h|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But if he has a doubleton?  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: And South has @HJxx?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni usually gets it right in these situations|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then I think you probably need to ruff low ... this hand is a nightmare|pg||
nt|othered1: ruff low and go down|pg||
nt|bjacobs: On this layout yes,|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But try giving North a low doubleton heart, and see what you think the winning play might be|pg||
nt|othered1: true|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The more I stare at it, the more nightmarish this hand is|pg||
nt|othered1: What are the consequences if north has 7=2=4=0?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He really really really needs to divine the trump layout.  Ruffing low could easily be the only winning play|pg||
nt|dinos1: if exchange @h9 and J - must discard)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pitching a club caters for both as long as the remaining hearts are 2-2|pg||
nt|othered1: south must have KQ doubleton, then for it to make, no?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But I think I will agree with Roland today, and predict that Fantoni will make the hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Fantoni is unfolding his cards ....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So instead of guessing which heart to ruff with, I think it's better to pitch|pg||
nt|dinos1: so shd guess initial @h break|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And lets give credit to Bessis Jnr, who found the play of giving declarer a "ruff and discard"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nasty young man|pg||
nt|dinos1: so - if S has now 3 trumps - must ruff with 10, if 2 trumps - discard|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3 trumps including J|pg||
