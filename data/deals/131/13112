nt|Gerben42: with only 2@H, dbl is ok I think|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|eleni: The Ladies Mrs.Panagaki and Mrs.Syrakopoulou may lose their @h fit:(|pg||

nt|Gerben42: now will play 3@C|pg||
nt|zoh:  2@s?|pg||
nt|mcphee: well 1NT is a choice but with only 2@H dble is much more comfortable|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the problem is, now south will overrate his 7 hcp. |pg||
nt|eleni: on BBO, North is ddiony and South nickd, West is vasso, East doest play on BBO:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Results at the moment are: Levi 88 - Hliapas 91 and Zeis 92.|pg||

nt|zoh:  duck the King|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Gerben42: must make since 2@H does not|pg||

nt|vugraphzge: den to emfanizei ws 22|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lelos: zozis never opens an 11count balanced hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|petrosa: is it the real result?|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: -1 is the real result, ill change it|pg||
nt|petrosa: ok it is logical|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rodal f: Hard to find3NT as best contract here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: lots of tricks in @S |pg||
nt|eleni: 16 teams play in this round robin and just 8 of them will be forwarded to the last round|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|Gerben42: 2@C is a tricky bid, now S will think his hand is worse than it is|pg||
nt|Gerben42: playing 2/1 I guess 1NT followed by 4@S is better|pg||
nt|mcphee: well that could lead to a missed slam|pg||
nt|zoh:  To 2@s einai forcing game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well 3@s is promising|pg||
nt|eleni: so far so good up to now:) good players play the correct contracts in both tables:)|pg||
nt|lelos: hard to find @d lead also|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|eleni: a most aggressive bid:) at the other table, E-W are simply at 2NT|pg||
nt|eleni: the lead was also a @h|pg||
nt|eleni: John is thinking very long and he is right|pg||
nt|droopy17: gia 1 kato|pg||
nt|eleni: On the final contest 4 teams will plau on knock outs for qualification of 1/2/3/4 places|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Tasos:) and welcome|pg||
nt|bmkl: easy game despite duplicate values in @cs|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mcphee: frankly i see not reason for S to not bid 3@H ater 2@S|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C will lead to missed slam more often opposite @C shortness|pg||
nt|zoh:  Logika i antam einai @d|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|eleni: a pretty dubious contract:)|pg||
nt|lelos: logiko to gurisma afou o karlaftis eipe 3@h|pg||
nt|rodal f: Homeit runned for a push|pg||
nt|lelos: Hi Frank :)|pg||
nt|eleni: Same contract in the open room|pg||
nt|petrosa: I would open the N hand: 2NT|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|mcphee: can actually manage 11 tricks here for a decent score|pg||
nt|mcphee: best is to take @D finesse asap|pg||
nt|MolvaM: might make 12 tricks if he finesses @d|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes |pg||
nt|zoh:  Mono i @h einai kalo gyrisma|pg||
nt|eleni: Those teams are Nos 1 & 2 up to now (in the first 3 rounds) No 1 is Altinis Team, while Sapounakis team is 2nd|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Gerben42: how do you get 12|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|mcphee: the @D finesse is clearly best choice|pg||
nt|lelos: paizei ton zozi gia K@c kai A@s|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|eleni: Please be with us, tomorrow at 17:00 CET and Sunday 9:30CET|pg||
pc|d8|nt|MolvaM: @d finesse is not extremely risky as he can discard his @h loser even if @d finesse loses|pg||
nt|eleni: yes zoh, a @h return would have been killing|pg||
nt|Gerben42: no entries for @C@D squeeze|pg||
nt|mcphee: @h yes a better defence, but with right view nothing matters|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he needs friendly breaks in all suits though|pg||
nt|mcphee: @D hook cash A, @H to hand and ruff @D loser|pg||
nt|mcphee: draw trumps and claim|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Gerben42: then you still lose a @H for 11|pg||
nt|eleni: with the 10@d return, he has chances|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|Gerben42: only way is a dummy reversal, ruff 3@C and win the @C9 as  12|pg||
pc|s8|nt|eleni: 9@s and let it ride...........|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mcphee: can ruff @C good but still needs to finesse @D|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
