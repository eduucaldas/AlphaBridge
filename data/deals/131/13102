nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone and welcome back to Reno in Nevada for the annual Vanderbilt Knockout Teams. Quarter-finals, four segments of 16 boards; this is the second|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My fellow commentators are Bill Frisby, Bill Jacobs and Mikael Westerlund|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Good evening Mikael and Bill|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Betheau-Nyström play a rather complicated strong club system with lots of relays|pg||

nt|fabsayc: interesting choice of card to lead, catering to singleton jack in dummy|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|brolucius: North offers a choice of games by making a transfer response (2@D) and then bidding 3NT.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/OpenTeams/Sweden/bertheau-nystrom.pdf|pg||
nt|athene: Only eight tricks on a club lead; declarer might try to sneak one heart through and then run for home|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: Only eight tricks, as we see.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The N-S system is natural more or less. 1@C wither natural or a 17-19 NT. Transfer responses|pg||
nt|mikael_w: there is alot to do, but seems to me as it always make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We usually have lots of Davids commentating, now a couple of Bills. Welcome to both of you|pg||

nt|athene: Defenders will often hold up instinctively when declarer plays on dummy's long suit, unless they can see the setting tricks for sure.|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c5|nt|diaoff: hi all|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|bjacobs: Yes, the contract could still make, as the defenders can never untangle 5 tricks, but it would take fine card reading from declarer|pg||

nt|Walddk2: We know there is a typo in the NS team name (should be De Knijff). We can't change it now, sorry|pg||
nt|warrens:  Zaleski returned original 4th best at trick 2.  some players return lowest from 5 because it's easier for partner to read|pg||
nt|mikael_w: a realy nice first board anyway, intresting for sure|pg||
nt|bjacobs: too interesting|pg||
nt|athene: 6@C here might be findable|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|an|0+ !D|nt|athene: after 1@C - 1@H; 2@D west can really value his @CQJ|pg||
mb|2N!|an|!H-!C|nt|brolucius: Yes, but then West would have no reason to unblock.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fredin is going to bid spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: But that is no obstacle|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@C next|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That should show the hand, more or less|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: At the other table North was declarer. East led a club, the king winning. declarer took five diamonds and the top spades, then played a heart. Up went the ace and the defenders ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: claimed the remainder.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Swedish team holds a unique record at this point. They have won every single quarter until now!|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Looks like it will come down to the blackwood soon to decide the level|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: west might be a bit worried his partner has 2-0-4-7 perhaps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What does 4@H mean here?|pg||
nt|athene: they could be off the @SAK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They could. What is 4@H now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need to have an agreement, for sure|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hlortz: 4@H a bit pushy no? got 2 useful cards from partner Q@H A@D|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: Sure but it wouldn't hurt - if West thinks his partner probably has four, but might have five, he can unblock much more happily than if he isn't sure if it's 3 or 5.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Still seems a bit risky to me. Is that common practice?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, it would be nice if you knew 100% partner would take 4@H as a cue for spadse|pg||
nt|athene: spades|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: and presumably 3@H over 2@D would be natural and GF, so why wouldn't he?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think this was question was the key to the auction |pg||
nt|Walddk2: What would 4@H be for you, guys when preceded by 2@S?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: no blackwood there|pg||
nt|athene: a cue for clubs sorry|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bjacobs: There are a number of aspects to this question, Roland|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: First, do E/W play any gadget after a reverse after a 1-over-1?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In particular, what is 2@H over 2@D?  What is 3@H over 2@D?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I guess 2 @s was GF ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do they play strong jump shift is also an important issue as David Greenwood points out|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If 2@H is natural and weak, then West might have to bid 2@S to start the forcing auction.  Then 4@H later might be natural|pg||
nt|Walddk2: De Knijff-Wrang bid the slam next door|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|athene: Well as a couple of people have pointed out, if East really did hold only three clubs, declarer surely wouldn't have played them like that.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sweden off to a flyer, as happened in the first set|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The moral to this is: you need to discuss Reverse auctions with your partner.  You don't see a lot about it in the literature, which is a shame|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|bjacobs: In the other room, it seems West just punted.  In a way, that auction was no better than this one.  It just got a bigger score.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|s3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If 2@S is game-forcing, as I think it is, 4@C sets clubs in my view|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Seems fair.  "You had your chance to bid hearts again partner"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "When you don't, I name CLUBS as trumps"|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||

nt|Walddk2: A Fredin overcall|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He must have read Sabine Auken's book|pg||
nt|athene: Fredin obviously agrees with Sabine Auken that a 2@C overcall over 1@D is a good thing to do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: "Get in with 2@C over 1@D as often as possible"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, but that bid is essentially a psyche|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: They were talking in the lobby prior to game time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: about Sabine?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, a friend of mine (Marc Smith) co-wrote that book. It's good.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: I am impressed if you understand Swedish, John|pg||
pc|d3|nt|warrens:  a good preemptive raise, we'll see if E comes in or not|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Paul Hackett|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|warrens:  a great steal -50 versus a vul game|pg||
nt|athene: Bidding 4@H in these auctions usually pushes opps into 4@S, but here the colours slowed West down a bit.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Sabine and Peter just chatting|pg||
nt|mikael_w: For you that havent seen Peter Fredin played before can I only say, Buckle up and sit still, He is well known for his odd way to play|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT was good/bad, showing a light club raise i guess?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Lots of random swedish here this week|pg||
nt|athene: assuming west bids 3@H, east is still a bit stuck|pg||
nt|mikael_w: These days its comon to put the pressure on the opps, But this is even to much for me :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Swedes are bidding as if they owned the place|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Ah, East has West in on his secret|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: west knows now that all his cards are working|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bjacobs: Now if West happens to show his two aces, despite his mediocre hand ...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|brolucius: South will not believe that his adventurous gambit has succeeded.|pg||
nt|athene: so even with a minimum in hcp he can show some enthusiasm|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This hand mirrors the one before ... cueing in the suit you have shown.  But here, E/W have clearly established their fit first|pg||
nt|athene: the very light overcall might well backfire|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Left to their own devices, the Swedes had no slam ambitions in the other room|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: Finally a good board for France|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The @S10 makes this an acceptable slam - just|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: wow, maybe they'll get to 7|pg||
nt|athene: West has grand ambitions!|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he puts his partner with a fifth diamond|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think West is just being a good partner.  He's informing East that all the keys are there|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, as I see it 6 @d is unbeatleble|pg||
nt|athene: if east had @SAKQ10x @DAQxxx then 7@D would be ok|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is surely showing more than a mere 12 count balanced|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mikael_w: But 7 is a more sensitive contract for sure :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is just about the end of the match|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think you can just "be a good partner" once you have bid blackwood - you have to have grand slam interest|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did I say finally a good board for France?|pg||
nt|athene: once west bids blackwood, he should be taking control|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|brolucius: We can expect E/W to find 4@S at the other table, so that will be a jump start for the Swedish team.|pg||
nt|warrens:  declarer has to decide to play for Qx of @D or Q10 onside.  I expect him to play for the drop.|pg||
nt|athene: These days it's quite a common gambit to jump to 4@H with huge defence to spades, hoping to push opps into 4@S - perhaps EW were scared of that.  If either one had had a bit more ...|pg||
nt|athene: he would have acted over 4@H, surely.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6@D is only fair, because if South had @SJxxx (or North), then it doesn't have much of a play|pg||
pc|h4|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 7@D needs a different adjective to describe it|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|brolucius: Auction was the same at the other table!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The French team playing four-handed, whereas Fredin-Fallenius are sitting out for Sweden. They will be playing the remainder (48 boards) I am told|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Specs wondering why Nyström does not have the  ö  instead of o. Logical explanation: they don't have the  ö  on American keyboards|pg||

nt|paulhac:  4-4-4-1 singleton club|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: if 4@D promised a fifth diamond, then it was east's fault, but if it didn't, what did he do that was wrong?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nothing, apart from that teensy weensy 7@D bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fredin does not miss any games vulnerable and not this one either|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  I believe this shows a singleton club or diamond|pg||
nt|diaoff: or single @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Many players bid the singleton but as it is often doubled for the lead some have reverted to the suit above|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: The French style used to be fairly sedate, as opposed to the Northern European teams who like to bid a lot more, but I don't know if that is really still true these days.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: There you go|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No invite, just 4@H|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Same margin as this match|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: West may be in two minds if East does produce a double. No, he has passed.|pg||

nt|mcphee: no was very reasonable spot|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|warrens:  maybe Stayman, then 2@S|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|warrens:  lol|pg||
nt|athene: Or not of course :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: He accepted his own invitation.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: He just decided he had a game-force with a four-card spade suit.|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think the Swedes might be a tad more agressive than the French.  But it's still early.|pg||
nt|athene: Not everyone would agree with either of those two assessments, but anyway, here we are.|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Better contract than 4@S as the cards lie and on the lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Ah well, I suppose that was understandable, but it's not how I would bid the hand|pg||
nt|hlortz: n must be relaying to get a description of souths hand ....|pg||
nt|mcphee: they have pretty sophisticated methods these boys|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: no questions or explanations|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brolucius: North's sequence shows four spades, so South would have corrected if he was 4-4 in the majors.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now just a matter of knocking out the @DA for nine easy tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hlortz: 6@D not bad till you look at ew cards|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes, with this layout 3N is all they can manage|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: South showed 3-2-4-4 and  3-4 AKQ points (A=3 K=2 Q=1)|pg||
nt|hlortz: when north plays a high @D he will smile|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mcphee: just the sort of hand where you relax a bit and think its easy:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bjacobs: I guess, the French earned the swing in the CR with the 3@C opening ...|pg||

nt|warrens:  well played here.  he'll finesse and still make it|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Bompis transferred to spades and bid 3NT next|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Invites do not exist any more I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Pilon pause|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I like Bertheaus evaluation of his spade suit|pg||
nt|warrens:  but they play 15-17 in the other room, don't they?  |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: not a very jovial table here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: If the defenders have taken two hearts, in 4@S, declarer has to escape for one spade loser. When the 9 forced an honor, and the 10 does not appear from East on the second round, ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: certain inferences can be made.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes to 15-17 that is|pg||
nt|athene: Yes, but East plays the @S10 on the second round of trumps surely.|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Is this a book hand David?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer cannot pick up K-10-x-x with East, so a finesse of the jack cannot make the contract.|pg||
nt|athene: It's a standard obligatory falsecard isn't it?|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes on spade 10.  East did not play the 10 on the second round and South might have made it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Indeed. A lucky punt by Quentin, but it was winning|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mcphee: will dump a @H and play @D I suspect|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes so long as the @S lead -the 8 - wasnt from 5 cards hes safe|pg||

pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: And Björn Fallenius makes history there. The only player to have first represented his country of origin, then a new country (USA) and finally back to his native country|pg||
nt|mcphee: surely 2@D is a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|hlortz: very conservative pass from east....|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brolucius: Patrick Jourdain may have represented England, Scotland and Wales. Not quite sure about that.|pg||
nt|warrens:  I don't understand 2@C.  Can't West be 3532 or 2542?  East's hand looks suitable enough for NT.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mikael_w: Former Kokko and these days Kaj Toivosson|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, here we have an intresting auktion|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|athene: some people would have seized the opportunity to pass with north's hand after the redouble|pg||
nt|athene: rather than having to bid a 3-card suit|pg||
nt|athene: but perhaps he was worried it would be taken as a penalty pass|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Probably not worried about that.  I think he was trying to display confidence, because he was concerned about going for a number|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, as we all can see @dA and another @d is best|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|s2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brolucius: Yes, and if E/W do have a club fit, N/S may find it easy to compete in spades.|pg||
nt|athene: 1NT has to be a good hand there, so East might have decided he had enough stuff to pass, rather than allowing the lead through West's spade.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|mikael_w: But maybe this works too|pg||

mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: 3NT was wrong-sided in the closed room, but it did not get a heart lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @CQ|pg||

pc|d3|nt|brolucius: Surprising South could not find some action.|pg||
nt|athene: Normally with that shape, a re-opening double is obligatory, but North has rubbish and his partner is a passed hand, so it's a bit different|pg||

nt|Walddk2: At long last ....|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ritong: hm|pg||
nt|athene: if south wins a diamond and plays a spade, declarer has to go up with the @SA otherwise the defenders return to hearts and set up one spade, two hearts and two diamonds, to beat|pg||
nt|athene: but it's not that hard now he has two fast heart tricks |pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's certainly an awkward one|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If he thinks hearts are 4-4, he can guarantee the contract (if diamonds are 3-3) by simply leading diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: small diamond from hand now perhaps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3-2, sorry|pg||
nt|athene: he is going to just take the finesse of the @DQ - you would prefer to lead to the @D9 first in case north has @DJ10 without the @DK, but you don't really want to use up a black ace ...|pg||
nt|athene: getting to dummy|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bjacobs: The 4 was lead, the 3 played (in hearts).  He needs to subject his opponents to the Spanish Inquisition on their leads and signals|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 5@D can go down, but it's all double dummy|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think the distinction is where you have a legitimate claim.  At trick 12, declarer leads to the KJ - you are sitting over it with the AQ ... ok, you can whisper away|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Listen to this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East passed!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South opened 1@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West overcalled 1@H, then 1@S by North|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East's rebid was 6@H!|pg||
nt|diaoff: Never argue with success :)|pg||
nt|athene: Yes that all seems reasonable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think I would pass the East hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: You would open 1@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, 1@D|pg||
nt|athene: I really don't know what the winning action is with that East hand - even a computer simulation isn't going to give you the "truth" because so much depends on how everyone is going ...|pg||
nt|athene: to bid later on|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Seems wrong to pass a 5-loser hand with two aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: back|pg||
nt|brolucius: I think I would pass and hope to describe it well later.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 75 minutes to play 3 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|diaoff: I like the pass, it's often efficient just listen one round with such settings...|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: Strul still 50 up against Lynch|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here we have another slam|pg||
nt|mcphee: hipe they get them all in:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: we won't start before that as boards all the same in all matches|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ritong: question is: which size|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7@D is pretty good, isn't it?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ritong: roughly @ds 3/2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: what about clubs?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: This start will make you bid it with some science|pg||
nt|athene: I remember someone saying with a singleton and a void you should splinter in your singleton and then cue your void, or something|pg||
nt|Walddk2: de Knijff's 6@H was a punt, a successful one admittedly|pg||
nt|athene: He might have been drunk at the time, of course|pg||
nt|brolucius: He maybe wanted it to sound like a punt to deter a sacrifice. |pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: How do you show two splinters? :)|pg||
nt|ritong: that is the rough part:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Diamonds 3-2 and clubs 4-1 would still be awkward|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Why did no-one invent that|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@C splinter. Give Bill a brownie point.|pg||
nt|athene: Well West is going to force to slam now surely|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think they will bid 7@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 7@H might make, but unlikely that they will bid it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not a usage of 4NT that will receive the Nobel Prize for Blackwood.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Zaleski thinking about how to show two keycards ands a void presumably|pg||
nt|athene: Now east is worried, because if he shows two keycards and a void, his partner will think he has a spade void :)|pg||
nt|athene: club void sorry|pg||
nt|warrens:  i'm betting on 5@s, 2 + the Queen|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yep, I think to feel fine you need both minors beak|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brolucius: West will be surprised to hear that his partner holds only 8 points.|pg||
nt|warrens:  wrong again|pg||
nt|athene: i thought the standard way to bid these was 5NT = 2 keycards and void somewhere|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Commentators always lose their bets, Warren|pg||
nt|mcphee: with the @S suit so nice 7 is on|pg||
nt|hlortz: another grand :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Predicting is dangerous|pg||
nt|athene: 5NT even   keycards that is|pg||
nt|athene: with an odd number of keycards you can cue 6 of the void or bid 6trump suit if the void is higher|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is not for West to gamble on which void partner has.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must be clubs, right?|pg||
nt|athene: so if east had bid 6@H, that would have shown odd keycards and higher-ranking void (hence must be spade)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The odds lie steeply in that direction, it is true.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can't make partner believe that you have a singleton in the splintered suit and a void elsewhere|pg||
nt|brolucius: No.|pg||
nt|brolucius: But West can hardly count 13 tricks even so.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 6@C now as a general grand slam try|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easy for us to find that bid|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: and for Pilon|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|brolucius: Blackwood auctions where BOTH players have a void are particularly awkward. Better to avoid them. |pg||
nt|athene: Perhaps at this point south begins to wish he had doubled 4@C :) maybe that would have other meanings for them, though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This hand alone is worth all the money we paid to watch this match|pg||
nt|brolucius: French kibitzers will not agree, if they reach 7@H.|pg||
nt|mcphee: this is going to be a shock to W who is expecting those cards to be offside|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Well ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How obvious is it for North to lead a club?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would say close to zero|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: slow connection|pg||
nt|ritong: fallenius will certainly know almost everything about his part s hand, except the minor jacks|pg||
pc|s8|nt|brolucius: Sighs of relief all round.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: either minor-suit jack in north's hand makes the grand slam a lot better of course :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: We shall never know what the lead would have been against 7|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't think I would have doubled 4@C on the South cards. That can sometimes help their auction.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: lots of alerts, no questions or answers|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nyström-Bertheau (sitting out in this set) are able to spot jacks with their  zzz  relays|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s6|nt|brolucius: In any case North might assume that East's void was in clubs too.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: All the sutton there is a relä-system going on :) We have not seen a single bidding like this before from Fredin-Fallenius|pg||
nt|athene: are they so-called because of the behaviour they induce in opps during the auction?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: I actually don't know why they are called  zzz   A = 3  K = 2  Q = 1   z's|pg||
nt|athene: oh right i know them as "zeeps"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: are they any good?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Fallenius now trying to put auction together|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like it|pg||
nt|athene: having reached the 5-level, south starts thinking in earnest about what suit should be trumps :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well the Jacks Union don't like them.  And it's the lack of minor suit jacks that make this a bad grand|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ritong: oole|pg||
nt|po-s: might East lead a diamond against  club slam?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They had 12 rounds of bidding against me a few years ago, landed in 6NT and told us before the lead: "All you have is @HA"|pg||
nt|athene: well the two 7@D contracts cancel out i suppose|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: So they claimed before the lead|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, If Fallenius in any way invite Fredin to Grand, Fredin will offcurse say NO, after showing all the honors|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
mc|12|nt|athene: perhaps south has bid this on the basis that if partner has @DJ or @CJ, grand is good, and even if he hasn't, it's not so bad|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Good board for Sweden. They can't make anything worth mentioning|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: NS got carried away in the other room|pg||
nt|brolucius: They should be, after an auction like that.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: hehe|pg||
nt|athene: south can just show majors over 1nt can't he?|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4@H was a good bid from N robbing E of it|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he doesn't have to go doubling things and getting all excited|pg||
nt|diaoff: Shows at least 43 in majors|pg||
nt|athene: To be fair, South's hand is worth a LOT more facing 5+ spades, which perhaps he was expecting on the closed room auction|pg||
nt|brolucius: But it was North who jumped to 4@S.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|brolucius: Surely not a free bid from North now.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kaj Toivosson says that it was Johan Ebenius who invented the  zz, not Auby. Oh well ...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brolucius: Goodness me!|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: Double in the other room was majors maybe but in that case does north really have a 4@S bid?|pg||

mb|2S|nt|brolucius: South will redouble on that hand!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: 4@H isn't trivial - declarer might lose two clubs, @DK, spade|pg||

mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|hlortz: the team up 50 likes these tame partscores|pg||
nt|mcphee: he will start @H from the table at once|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: i wonder why fredin has no way to express his enthusiasm for @hs|pg||
nt|athene: but the defence have to attack spades at some point before one goes on a club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes it was Ebenius, confirmed by Fredrik Nyström|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H looks strange unless 3@H promised a fit|pg||
nt|athene: in which case is that because NS play 3@D there as GF|pg||
nt|athene: or was 2@D itself GF?|pg||
nt|po-s: remarkable - West must cover the diamond seven to legitimately beat  the contract. South needs to ruff a spade so the D6 will produce a trick eventually I think|pg||
pc|d9|nt|brolucius: North had every chance to pass 2@D when his partner showed a hand that was perhaps only 4-3 in the majors. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: If 2@C can be 4-3, perhaps 2@S was a slight overbid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: used to be 2h was balanced, 2nt was hearts|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Kaj and Ebenius played together for many years, and Johan Ebenius absolutly LOVED exprement with bidding systems|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told 3@D there was forcing to game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: balanced being 6322|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: since with a very poor hand and a long major, south could bid it directly in response to 2@C|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|brolucius: Leave out the word 'slight' and I will agree with you.|pg||
nt|athene: you would never call anything "a overbid" David|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|diaoff: Normally 5+ @D if 4-3 though, so there were some extra info|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|diaoff: Anyway, an overbid in my opinion|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Swedish NPC, Jan Kamras, says it shows 4-4|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see, but he was not in the 4th seat, so I don't agree with 2@S at all. (I do realise that he is 10 times a better player than me but...)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: but also, as Dan said, can be 4-3 with five diamonds on the side|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So they are both right|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Bertheau long pause|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 33 minutes left in quarter|pg||

nt|brolucius: No need to use up every minute, though. Perhaps you can point that out to them.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are on board 11 in the closed room of our other match|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fleisher up by 41 against Diamond|pg||
nt|paulhac:  What is the longest time omeone has taken to play a board?|pg||
nt|brolucius: On Board 11 where I noted the lack of a negative double from Nystrom on his 10-count (he passed you will recall), South did make a negative double at the other table and they are ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: now in 2@S on a 7-card fit.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 28 minutes, Barnet Shenkin in a Scottish cup tie|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Barnet Shenkin took 33 minutes once|pg||
nt|jtr: You took 3 minutes once Paul|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Barnet says 28|pg||
nt|brolucius: Any advance on 33?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: ahh|pg||
nt|brolucius: Did he make it?|pg||
nt|jtr: 3 down|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|brolucius: I wonder what the longest pause has been before someone said 'Oh, sorry, is it my bid?'|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sadly, both Ebenius and Auby are no longer with us|pg||
pc|h8|nt|warrens:  I was playing against a British declarer in the semifinals of the Transnationals.  He was playing a double contract that if made we would lose the match.  He took so long they penalized him 15 IMPs and he went down anyway, so we won by over 30.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Two strnage auctions I think it's fair to say, so a flat board probably justified|pg||

mb|2C!|an|!H|nt|warrens:  Unlikely to be repeated.|pg||

nt|athene: you need the heart finesse and the spades to come in|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: 6@C is better as you just need the spades to come in for a diamond pitch|pg||

nt|Walddk2: what else can Zaleski bid?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, offcurse he had already decide, But he played verry fast, becuse if E take the A sometimes he might get it all wrong and return a @s maybe :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  He might just bid 6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I would say so.  East encouraged spades, and he won't have @SQJ10x|pg||
nt|mikael_w: not a big chanse, but still an extra chanse |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: East really has pretty good cards but it's that five-card club suit with the @C109 which make the slam good|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Maybe 2@D artificial to find out about five clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In fact, he won't have @SJ10x (would lead it), so indeed Fredin knew the hand|pg||

nt|mikael_w: grace time ? what is that|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: only 1 table of 4 in this room done now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 10 minutes at end of round|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: for completion|pg||
nt|mikael_w: then why is it not simply 16 min left on clock ?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|nt|bjacobs: Because you only get the10 minutes once?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: they put 75 minutes on clock for each 8 boards|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D is puppet to 4@H, to sign off?|pg||
nt|hlortz: 3n X is going down a few... |pg||
nt|mcphee: it sure is|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|athene: this is hard for the defence because they know nothing about north's hand|pg||
nt|po-s: no, I think it means Partner I don´t know what we are doing|pg||
nt|athene: other than that he wants to play in 4@H facing what south has :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But North knows about East's hand, via the double|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzfd: Peter asked did I get it right?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What was the point of that double, by the way?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d9|nt|athene: I wonder if any pair found 6@C? if so, well done|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mcphee: best to grab this now|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|athene: well i suppose East sort of wants his partner to lead a club against notrumps|pg||
nt|athene: if he has something like @CQx or @C10xx anyway :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s3|nt|bjacobs: It might work.  Of course, if it turns partner aways from @HQxxxx, that would be a shame|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: 2@C = Game Force Relay   2@D=11-13 bal  with @C stop  3@S = 5@D 33 2@S|pg||

nt|warrens:  nice play of J@D at trick one.  if it loses, declarer would certainly finesse if partner led another @D and that way the suit won't block if partner led from 8xxxx|pg||
nt|athene: If East had found out his partner had five clubs, then his @CJ would be worth a lot more and he might well force to slam|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Final hand of a swingy set.  A big well done to our fine operator John Schwartz.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, a push|pg||
nt|mcphee: can't say I like the t/o dble but have some sympathy|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Many thanks to John Schwartz in Reno. Great job!|pg||
nt|athene: but even so he might bid it in notrumps rather than clubs|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks, John!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to my fellow commentators: Warren, David and Bill|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And thanks to my fellow commentators, Roland, William, Mikael, with a little help from PO and Henri.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I did see wrong :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Finally, our appreciation to the ACBL, in particular Jeff Johnston and Jan Martel for broadcasting this prestigious event. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ART GF|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@d is GF|pg||
mb|1D!|an|0+ !D|nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and to Paul Hackett of course, sorry Paul|pg||
nt|paulhac:  :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Jan Martel, on behalf of the ACBL, has been instrumental in setting up a fine show|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh no, not a 1NT contract to end the set....... |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks like a dinner break now - next set is a couple of hours away|pg||
nt|po-s: Now tough to get to slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: NS obviously don't play 14-16  NT in 4th|pg||
nt|warrens:  is 1NT in 4th position 15-17?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do they show aces over 2@D, Henri?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, very likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Next set 11:00 eastern |pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: it does seem a bit fiddly to change your range by one point depending on seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 15-16 in 4th|pg||
nt|athene: although meckwell among others do just that|pg||
nt|paulhac:  More and more common to play 14-16 in 1st and second and 15-17 in third and 4th|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes it was an awkward hand to bid he clearly expected more from the 3@C bid|pg||
mb|3H!|an|Forcing, choice of games|nt|brolucius: We have been spared 1NT - not that 2@S is entirely enthralling.|pg||
nt|ritong: ouch|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: In 1 hour 49 minutes and 23.7 seconds, approximately|pg||
nt|mcphee: well not sure he was entilted to |pg||
mb|4H|nt|mikael_w: :)|pg||
nt|po-s: will he show his HK?|pg||
nt|ritong: albert will not visualize such strength after 3NT|pg||
nt|harmon: Hi all|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not sure you can bid this scientifically.  I think West will punt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hlortz: and east ezpected more clubs :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|po-s: that´s probably it|pg||
nt|mcphee: he was entitled to :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|mikael_w: Feals a little lotto-like where to end with this hand5,6 or 7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Three slam swings in this set, two for the Swedes, one for France|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|brolucius: Still, I shouldn't complain when he have just enjoyed two really big hands. And the 4@S doubled.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We won't be able to start until all of the tables have compared because they are all playing the same boards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And they are VERY slow in the closed room of our other match|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, but it seems to me that all West needed was a king to go with the spade ace .... 5@C looks very cautious|pg||
nt|ritong: 3NT, bill|pg||
nt|mcphee: a welcome lead for nystrom and it will shorten the play|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hlortz: well Zaleski has its work cut out for it stuck 50 some with 16 to play|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Are they playing the same boards? David Greenwood told me they weren't.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On 13 now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They were not until today|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ah, I see.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is also uncertain which matches we are going to show next|pg||
nt|athene: Declarer doesn't have a fast entry to hand to throw a club on the @HJ, but leading a diamond up will effectively do the trick because if west jumps in with his ace, that solves the ...|pg||
nt|athene: diamond suit|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: Depends on scores in the two matches we did not watch|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|ritong: the most discouraging bid he could make|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: but of course declarer doesn't know the diamond is right|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Interesting line|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|bjacobs: I understand, but 4@S must show a little interest|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Declarer said I should have further Q|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks everyone, I bid you all good night|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Cheers|pg||
nt|po-s: Bill, without looking at all four hands, wouldn´t you think East has AK of spades|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Well, Thanks all, See most of you in 1 hour and 45 min |pg||
nt|ritong: well well well...merci a tous anyway:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Nite all|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think he has the ace ... who knows about king?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: double of 2@S showed the ace I think|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But yes, one can certainly sympathize with West|pg||
nt|mikael_w: And thanks John for an exelent job|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then 4@S must show the king, no?|pg||
nt|po-s: his first double probably showed the ace - French way|pg||
nt|bjacobs: oh, ok, I didn't follow the methods properly|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In which case, all the specs complaining about 4@S (rather than 4@H) have a good point|pg||
nt|po-s: but you did look at all four...|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: So, the Swedes keeping the record of having won all quarters so far in the tournament. Very impressive|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: now he is stuck - sure to lose two diamonds and the trump as well, and two clubs|pg||
pc|h7|nt|brolucius: Indeed. Well, I will say goodbye now, since my wife has already asked 'How much longer?'  Thanks for watching! |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|athene: maybe rising the @DK was better, playing for the @D10 to deny the jack|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: and unblock the heart ace earlier as well|pg||
nt|mcphee: good set from the sweedish pair|pg||
nt|hlortz: do we know which matches will be on 4th quarter?|pg||
nt|mcphee: likely not|pg||
nt|hlortz: this one may not be if others closer|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: next sey in 1 hour would be my guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: maybe 2 eastern|pg||
nt|hlortz: pretty speedy at other table also|pg||
