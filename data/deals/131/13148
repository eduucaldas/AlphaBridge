mb|p|nt|ady: Awkward for west|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes -- I think I like 2@s|pg||
nt|robbg: probably 2@s maybe pass|pg||
nt|ady: may play in 2@S|pg||
nt|royhughes: Rather --  I don't like it, but might bid it|pg||
nt|robbg: 2@s better on balance in case partner has a good hand.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@s rebid seems ok..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|robbg: but Steve makes the other choice|pg||
nt|royhughes: What are the Levin-Weinstein methods?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|robbg: trump lead|pg||
nt|robbg: 2/1ish|pg||
nt|royhughes: Passing 2@d is quite a position, it seems to me|pg||
nt|ady: opted for pass   I dont like pass as there still may be game on and likely to have some play for 2@S even opposite a shortage|pg||
nt|robbg: At matchpoints I would think passing would be easy. At IMPs, it not only risks wrong partial, but maybe missing game.|pg||
nt|royhughes: In standard methods, partner might have a good 3=5=4=1, for example|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes. pass seems speculative|pg||
nt|royhughes: Most experts don't jump shift as opener without a huge hand|pg||
nt|robbg: If Levin had a good hand he might well be 3-5-4-1. With a minimum, he might have raised.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 11S SHOWED 5 IT WAS EXPLAINED.|pg||
nt|jbgood: ok, but still|pg||
nt|royhughes: So perhaps opener is unlikely to have 3 spades|pg||
nt|robbg: Ahh, they play Flannery, so east is unlikely to have 3.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|warrens:  best line looks like winning in hand and playing spades while dummy still has a trump entry.  but if he wants to make it, he might try to cash @c AK in order to be able to ruff in hand|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|dburn: maybe, but if after 4@c East does not cue in diamonds, maybe not|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|robbg: last chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In diamonds?|pg||
nt|jbgood: They play 2@s on  17 in the CR|pg||
nt|dburn: second last chance - five will still make|pg||
nt|royhughes: The West hand has a lot of things to fill -- I think he will pass|pg||
nt|dburn: he may bid Blackwood, just for drill, but when partner shows only one key card he may give up|pg||
nt|robbg: Levin is VERY light here and did make one try. Will Weinstein envision this? Even if he does, he is on a hook.|pg||
nt|robbg: If he bid Blackwood, he is going missing 1|pg||
nt|robbg: People asking why cue 2nd rd controls - it is a partnership style.|pg||
nt|ady: potential for Fleisher to fall further behind here|pg||
nt|royhughes: This is a hand that might be on 1 of 2 finesses from West's point of view|pg||
nt|royhughes: if his partner had spade Q, club A and a heart control|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: In his book Bob Hamman wrote, "If you're my partner, never play me for the perfect hand ... I won't have it."|pg||
nt|jbgood: W only collected 7 tricks in 2@s on 17 - a push|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is close to having it, though, @DK instead of @HK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But 4@S should deny that|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ady: 2 spades down 1 hand 17  so flat   2 spades very unlucky to go down|pg||
mb|5C|nt|robbg: Yes, the @cA is possible, but not the @dK I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|robbg: Now he is off one but could be the @sK in which case slam approaches 75%|pg||
nt|robbg: My prediction was wrong. Probably the first of many!|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, this is a deal where the king of trumps is not as good as an ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Weinstein now knows that the slam is no better than a finesse and signed off|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cT|pg||
mc|11|nt|dburn: the thing is that if Levin had @cA, @sQ and a heart control (so that slam was one of two finesses) he would possibly have bid 4@c-4@d-4@h, not 3@h first|pg||

nt|barnets: 22 imps on the position of the @DK|pg||
nt|dinos1: cue-bidding doesnt show extras. it shows location of controls|pg||
nt|daman: he is fortunate West had such a great hand|pg||

pc|h7|nt|robbg: Many expert pairs have gotten away from bidding stayman to invite NT because of the info about opener's hand that doing so conveys.|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|nt|dburn: and a 2@c opener with a four-card heart suit into the bargain|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|royhughes: I wonder if you can make 6H double-dummy, by endplaying North in clubs after taking 1 or 2 rounds of hearts|pg||
nt|robbg: Will discovering the missing @cK slow things down?|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|6H|nt|olson: N could exit a spade |pg||

pc|s9|nt|royhughes: Kibitzers are discussing trying to squeeze North out of non-clubs, followed by a club duck.  I'm not sure it can be done, and would be double-dummy|pg||

pc|h4|nt|robbg: It can be done, and it would be dbl dummy.|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, he can do it at double dummy, but...|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, if N throws 2 spades and a diamond his non-clubs can be stripped|pg||
nt|kit: In theory, North will have to take 3 discards.  He discards one of the pointed suits.  Declarer then runs that suit, squeezing North out of other pointed suit -- then throw him in. ...|pg||
nt|kit:  But unlikely to happen.|pg||
nt|jbgood: hands like this are often unfair, you go 1 down on a natural club finesse, whereas your opps are in the nevermaking 7 in the other room, going down 2 for a 2 imps gain|pg||
nt|robbg: I am told that Martel/Stansby are in slam on 24.|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Several kibitzers betting he will make it|pg||
nt|robbg: Presumably they will be down.|pg||
nt|royhughes: It looks like 4 rounds of hearts gives North an unsolvable problem if declarer reads it|pg||
nt|royhughes: After 4 rounds of hearts, if N pitches diamonds declarer plays diamonds, if he pitches spades, declarer plays spades|pg||
pc|s3|pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||

nt|dburn: they both might - Helgemo probably could not afford that club|pg||
nt|jbgood: the "Chinese finesse" just worked in the CR on 24 - spade queen lead and won ..'|pg||
nt|kit: another clue now is spade lead -- might have led club from J10 without king|pg||
nt|paulhac:  And when he did Gier could not afford one also|pg||
nt|jbgood: and it was in 6|pg||
nt|ady: now altered to 6@H making|pg||
nt|kit: this has been pretty bad discarding -- declarer will know what is going on, as an opponent with 5 diamonds would surely have discarded a diamond by now|pg||
nt|dburn: but Weinstein will be a puzzled man - why should the opponents let him make in this fashion? are they doing something devious, and if so, what?|pg||
nt|kit: Now club to ace, diamond to queen, and club off always makes if the hand was ever makable|pg||

mb|p|nt|barnets: Yes the french took a break and came back and have won some points afterwards|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|barnets: its a good idea to break after a poor board or 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Chip is staring at the box|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: I wuld bid 3N with south anyone else?|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: a kibitzer points out that 6d makes on c king lead-not a likely scenario|pg||
pc|s5|nt|odysseus69: meanwhile in 3NT declarer has temporary worries which soon go away|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 2 minutes left in this set but will add 10 minute grace period|pg||
nt|dinos1: btw - wd u rebid 3@d or 3N?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|dinos1: oh, sorry - didnt see above q :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|chick: I may be in the minority, but I would open the S hand 1N,  solves a lot of rebid problems|pg||
nt|barnets: if north was to hold the @SJ @DJ and a king 3N is on finesse|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|dinos1: too strong hand for just 3@d|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|barnets: perhaps they play weak nt but still|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: will restart at 6:00pm|pg||
nt|barnets: i would open1@D and rebid 2N|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d5|nt|chick: ok, they play weak NT, sorry|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|dinos1: as F?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|chick: but the same principle ... open 1@D, rebid whatever shows a 15-17 NT hand|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|barnets: I count 18 Hcp|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i would be terrified of missing out on a diamond slam if I started with 1NT - all these controls and a very good suit|pg||
mc|10|nt|dinos1: 18pc, 4 aces, and almost guaranteed fit in ur good 6-carder|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Restart at 6:00 Pacific Time in about an hour and half|pg||
