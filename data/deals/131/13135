nt|ahollan1: now that teams setup correctly -- again we'll have to give Phil and Debbie in the other room some time to manually enter scores before running total is correct|pg||
nt|mikael_w: lol. I have been told that the swedes has been playing on the grafic for Fleiseher, That might mean the swedes found the slam and not reverse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: be patient -- operator has to keep up with new boards THEN find time to backfill results from earlier boards|pg||

mb|r|nt|ahollan1: as our operator has entered -- sorry about htat|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, 8 points to a 14-16 and a balansed hand with ALL points in opps suit and BEHIND. I will always choose Dbl. IF 3 nt makes I am pretty sure 2@s will not be for free|pg||

nt|ahollan1: now both matches are 2 imp differences  those leaders are Fleisher and Zimmermann|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikael_w: well. 11 boards to play and a 2 IMP diferent|pg||

nt|mikael_w: this is not something to watch for people with week hearts, I know I will have some serius problems the last 3 boards if it will be this close|pg||
nt|jcwla: "I have to go the little boys' room.  Will someone please turn dummy?"|pg||

nt|xenya: but you were right about the outcome, Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so i just should have said "another GAME that won't make"|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome back Kit|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Kit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin knows he can ensure trump trick by playing another @S -- that is the fallback position for the beat|pg||
nt|jcwla: @S4 = "keep it comin' love, keep it comin' love..."|pg||
nt|kit: but no rush to -- in fact, he should probably shift to a trump|pg||
nt|kit: 4 of spades suit preference I believe|pg||
nt|xenya: he must be trying to work out how to beat it if S has a void|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- that's why play has halted -- Bobby exploring the other defenses|pg||
pc|sT|pc|hJ|pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: declarer taking only shot, hoping for Qx of hearts and no spade ruff out there|pg||

nt|ahollan1: or slim chance that @CA not cashed|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: make that extraordinarily slim  |pg||
nt|kit: he should be able to deduce the spade position I think|pg||
nt|mikael_w: brb|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4 suit pref for cont (or trump) - not higher or lower (well maybe 3 but 4 better as 3 may be misreadable) -- here even 5 would probably not be read for @D shortness|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Correct|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A nice 12 count ... maybe|pg||
nt|hlortz: oh fine :) south for me if u wish...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: asking if Marty had the jack of diamonds|pg||
nt|mrdct: personally i'm more like to open a bit light than a bit heavy in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, he might get this right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: His hand is better|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and a splendidly judged opening bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+  1@D=4+@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: I guess no Drury as they prefer to open at the two level with "marginal" openers|pg||
nt|ady: no time monitors when the play is slow?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|fabsayc: 1nt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: we are trying|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|Walddk2: I also like 1NT better than double|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make up to 10 tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@S comes close for EW here but 4-1 @D is going to be a problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this double will create a headache|pg||
nt|hlortz: me too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: writing what alert is can't see|pg||
nt|gambit: will find their spades now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS=weak NT, not 4@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: same start in other room|pg||
nt|mikael_w: before we did see n/s in the open room play 2 @d on a 5-1 fit. this time e/w has played 2@d in open room with a 4-2 fit :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: better bid 2@h as garbage?|pg||
nt|mcphee: redble worked out badly for W|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@C a transfer to @D?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: gazzilli probably|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 14+ any dist|pg||
nt|ralfwil: interesting with minors on N and majors on S:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: i hate balanced hand t.o dbls|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I am a little suprised that Fredin went down 1 in 4@s on board 36 ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Now, do I lead a trump? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now, tell us when you see dummy, Bill|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might deny 3@H too, but i won't put that in writing|pg||
nt|gambit: well, no 4@h and it is a feeble NT |pg||
nt|mrdct: they might have a try at 3NT at this vul|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bjacobs: Good dummy - this might be tough to beat|pg||
nt|mikael_w: as I been told its up to the players to demand a Time-monitor if they think the other side takes to much time|pg||
nt|dinos1: ok, no X, E bid 2@d. what shd W do?|pg||
nt|mcphee: so this is supposed to be pick ?|pg||
nt|chick: http://fribourg.com.ar/bridge/galerie%20des%20Champions/bertheau.jpg|pg||
nt|mcphee: well I assume W was going to bid 2@H over 2@D|pg||
nt|mcphee: seems a bit much to hope partner holds @D length|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think so to, but its prob pass he is thinking about|pg||
nt|mrdct: it's an under-pointed game - but 6-4 bid more|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and well judged pass by south|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mrdct: NS can probably only make 8 tricks in @s|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mrdct: good stop as i think there's only 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 14 - 16 with 6 spades|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well done to stop in 2 @s here|pg||
nt|gambit: one for the road. yikes|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|dinos1: XX is rather 5@c, no?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Berteau is explaining to Martel|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a bit random this stop|pg||
nt|gambit: the lead should warn the declarer|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gambit: EW 8 in NT |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: upside down carding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and it would be a pretty defense to see too Dave -- but @DQ won't get it done|pg||
nt|gambit: looks like a nice lead for declarer, imagining the J with W.....|pg||
nt|ady: this should fail by 1 or 2 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: specific defense for down 2   @H, @H, @H ruff with 10, @CA @H to score @SK|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bjacobs: You're bored as dummy, right Henry?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No he is not|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He said he would be South|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can declarer's hand also|pg||
nt|bjacobs: oh|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *see|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Actually, this is a pretty good feature for specs.  Take Helgemo's seat, ignore the commentary, and "play along" with him|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So Bill, can you beat it or not?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mikael_w: well, I dont think this kontract will make, but better result then in 2@d shod be 100%|pg||
nt|dinos1: long pause then 2@d creates problem with UI|pg||
nt|mcphee: 2@H is no success anyway|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, I'm going to give a ruff, and then sort of give up :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: duck|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now @H |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: or @C?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: oops   there is also @D loser    I missed that :(|pg||

nt|mcphee: not so sure|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Close to the truth|pg||
nt|mikael_w: good thing for E that S has @h2 instead of 8 or 9|pg||
nt|mrdct: good technique leading out the Q hoping the A will duck to avoid crashing honours|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: trump suit only thing is suit preference|pg||

nt|gambit: What can South do other than 1@h?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3 nt coming up|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mrdct: another unpredictable partscore hand?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might get to 3N too|pg||
nt|gambit: So bridge players drop their kids off and go play? Hmmm.....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: lol|pg||
nt|ady: should east become declarer in 3NT   might scramble 9 tricks if guessing Q@C  on an end play |pg||
nt|mrdct: i don't think 3NT will play very well|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Bjorn leaning in and playing with his hair|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H lead, triple hook @D, find @CQ  3N cold :)|pg||
nt|gambit: W looks more like a weak NT than "unbalanced". That you are after a case of Bud at a tailgate party in new Orleans |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: lots of talking between Marty and Peter|pg||
nt|mrdct: however, with a correct guess in @C you do have 8 tricks and a 9th make come if douth leads a @S or a long @D can get setup - problem for the defence is north never gets in to lead ...|pg||
nt|mrdct: the @SQ through|pg||
nt|mcphee: Nystrom thot he just had this hand:)|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3@d vs 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: looks rather easy|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and makes beause of the friendly lie in the red suits|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mrdct: that is all predicaded on east being declarer|pg||
nt|gambit: will he or won't he bid 3NT with his QJ@H?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 15 to 16 NT|pg||
nt|gambit: 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: I don't like 2NT for obvious reasons|pg||
nt|mrdct: double fit, lots of controls - i think they will at least make a try for slam|pg||
nt|gambit: 3@H from N?|pg||
nt|mrdct: ironically, if south patterned out to show a stiff @d that would make north upgraded his hand as 4 small is a great holding opposite a singleton|pg||
nt|gambit: checkback maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: wonder if 3@S would be NAT or partial @H stop|pg||
nt|ady: as they lay  if he guesses Q@C    the heart finesse is marked  and likely 6 hearts witth north  so South can be end played in diamonds to give a spade trick|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW will struggle to go plus on this board now|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 3@S   allowed n/s to play 3@D OR|pg||
nt|mikael_w: dont think its easy to come in to the bidding for n/s here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikael_w: why shod 6 @s go down ?|pg||
nt|gambit: S has to pass, N has not shown any strength|pg||
nt|mrdct: i suspect 4@H is signoffish as surely north has other forcing bids he could've made|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Marty is thinking|pg||
nt|gambit: MIGHT try 4@s but risky|pg||
nt|fabsayc: signoff hardly seems consistent with the hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: south's hand has improved now that he knows about the double fit|pg||
nt|mikael_w: OR 6 @h for that matter ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: reaching in box|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mcphee: well they had some toy in open room as S opened 2@C|pg||
nt|dinos1: def can take 1st 8 tricks but only d/dummy - @h, @d back|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: tough lead for East. what will you chose Ralf|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gambit: shirley (hmmmm) 3@H forc|pg||
nt|mrdct: difficulty now is that north wont picture the hand with a stiff @D|pg||
nt|gambit: if South has a normal 2NT with Kx of @D then diamond lead could sink it off the top, N should (and will) pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Mike has taken off his glasses|pg||
nt|mrdct: if he's concenred about that he can always go back to @H|pg||
nt|gambit: he can't believe it either, S probably wishing he had not bid 2NT |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: okay by Bjorn|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gambit: q@S lead will do it|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: okay by Peter|pg||
nt|ady: might manage down 1  |pg||
nt|mrdct: now he needs to control the damage and guess the @CQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Probably a @h but which? A @s lead had given N more problems|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bjacobs: heart lead please|pg||

nt|bjacobs: I (East) should be working the rule of 11 here, but I can't be bothered ...|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes west lead his best suit. well done|pg||
nt|hlortz: smile nod and play the 6 i'd say|pg||
nt|ady: meantime 9 tricks|pg||
nt|gambit: over 3@C, the 3@H, 3@s, all is well....|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: ? clear agreement|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 5 spade and 3 hearts|pg||
nt|gambit: wow|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a spec says "heart jack - partner almost certainly has nothing and you must lead several more times.  If you can fool declarer early you may beat him. "|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but impossible to find :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mrdct: doesnt appear to be a lot of science involved here but they have bid to a making slam so that's all that matters at score-up|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: now want the director here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: thinks break in tempo|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 2nt is slam try|pg||
nt|gambit: and 4S is chopped liver?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I guess the 6@h bid is a little suspect after N thinking for some time before bidding 5 @h|pg||
nt|mrdct: give me a break - every single bid i've seen in this 10 minutes per board event is a break in tempo|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: sent to get director|pg||
nt|gambit: I suppose, does seem a recipe for contention |pg||
nt|mrdct: who called the director east or west?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: east|pg||
nt|mrdct: then EW are out of luck|pg||
nt|gambit: Is hea whiner? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: facts are undisputed clear beat in tempo 2nt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 4s kc blackwood for hearts|pg||
nt|mrdct: if attention is drawn to the BIT by the screenmate it is presumed not to have happened|pg||
nt|gambit: was 2NT alerted as a slam try? I did not see that....|pg||
nt|mrdct: ah the BIT was for the 2NT bid not 5@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2@h was 5+ with short @h|pg||
nt|sybarra: oops wrong room |pg||
nt|mrdct: the important point for people who don't play with screens very often is that attention to the BIT can only be drawn by the opponent on the other side fo the screen|pg||
nt|mrdct: S&W are on one side of the screen|pg||
nt|gambit: and if it was, 4@H had to be a sign off (why not 3@H stillescapes me) so 4@S not counting the optimistic 6@H is questionable|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 4s kcb|pg||
nt|gambit: what would N have bid over 2NT with Axxxx 10xxx xx xx ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Marty picks up hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm at a loss to understand what damage EW could be claiming|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: How many entries do you think your partner has?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, I'm guessing South has @HAK and a spade card, say the king|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and in the minors?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i wd lead  a low @H|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bjacobs: So East really wants to know about that jack and ten of clubs|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hoping for a well positioned 9 from P|pg||

nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|bridge_one: sry - big problems with my provider|pg||
nt|mrdct: good point Al - getting the @CQ right doesn't help as it will be at the expense of an extra trump loser|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Peter -- carding is -- Marty standard|pg||
nt|ady: hi Giorgio|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi friends !|pg||
nt|ady: this will be a useful swing for Fleisher|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3NT wrong-sided in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other match just starting to bid this board -- will be interesting to see which trouble they get into|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fallenius best chance -- Kamil started with 14 cards|pg||
nt|ady: yes  had they played 3NT from east hand the swing could have been even worse|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Peter is still thinking|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think J here is his best chance to get out for -1|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 9 imps to Fleisher|pg||

nt|mrdct: was it described as RKCB on both sides of the screen?|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|kit: nope|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: what's panel's preference  Fallenius' DBL or Stansby's 1N overcall?|pg||
nt|kit: However, E-W made 2@D in other room, so not likely much of a swing|pg||
nt|kit: I definitely prefer 1NT|pg||
nt|xenya: i would double here|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1NT|pg||
nt|kit: maybe a point heavy, but so descriptive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brogeland also bid 1N -- Michel Bessis had to contend with Fantunes 2@D opener so forced to 2N|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|kit: West will give declarer a diamond trick if he continues the suit, but all alternatives are unattractive|pg||
nt|xenya: with the opening on his right and QJ9x in the opener's suit, the S hand is worth more than 18 hcp |pg||
pc|d8|pc|h8|pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|kit: and from his point of view, his partner might have 9 of diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but round shape, 1/2 points in quacks, slow tricks    yuk|pg||
nt|jcwla: Many play the 1NT overcall can be up to 18 - besides which http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AQT+KJ6+QJ95+AJ4|pg||

pc|s3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 2 dow this way tho|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: players discussing play @H out|pg||
nt|bjacobs: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: agreement 5 spades 3 heartsw not allow to bid a spade followed by hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: conventions over 2nt could sign off by bidding 3 clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 3 hearts would be forcing|pg||
nt|mrdct: 11 card fits on both sides so this figures to get to high level quickly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 4 hearts is heart and spade hand|pg||
nt|gambit: as it should be |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: limit raise he has to bid 1nt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: has more than limit raise|pg||
nt|gambit: S was nuts, unless he knows something we don't (which I suspect her does) maybe we didn't get those notes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Mike say is unfair i knew if I bid a spade and Marty bid 2 minor treated hand as strong as not to miss a game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: what is 3 hearts GF?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I didn't think about if it was slam try or not a slam try|pg||
nt|gambit: unfair? what was unfair? we are missing a piece of the puzzle...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I did not know the difference between 3 hearts and 4 hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: if you had 7 points he would had bid 2 hearts and not spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: now requesting the notes of the system for the director to read|pg||
nt|mrdct: i still dont see where EW can claim damage - NS had an uninterupted auction to 6@h on a hook and landed on their feet|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: next board and director will make a ruling|pg||
nt|gambit: usually slow arrival (3@H) shows more, fast arrival (4@H) shows lkess and says shut the f ....up |pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: please tell me that is not a weak bid |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=10-13 HCP, 6+@S|pg||
nt|mrdct: so two big fits here - NS will compete to at least 5@h - is there a chance of pushing EW into a makable slam though?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 4@S for EW looks reasonable|pg||
nt|gambit: Thx Al|pg||
nt|ady: some would open 3|pg||
nt|mrdct: even if to stop NS find a @H fit, i think east should do something here|pg||
nt|gambit: great to have system expert here, Thx to Al Hollander for that |pg||
mb|1D!|nt|gambit: Fleisher if given the room (to show 3H constructive)  will|pg||
nt|mrdct: but non vul opposite a 10-13 limited opener and only a known 6-2 fit game doesn't appear too likely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S blocking|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so 9 boards left in this tight match. going down to the wire|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: thats one way to put it Cam,  the other is "if you go on....at  your peril |pg||
nt|bucheister: not appropriate comments by gambit|pg||
nt|gambit: not if they don't enter the auction |pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: This is a lot more interesting than the usual commentary, says a spectator|pg||
nt|hlortz: thats the fascination of the game even world class players cant play double dummy... 'errors' are prevalent|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did I open a can of worms I wonder|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Maybe "I" should have opened 2@D (they play weak 2s in diamonds, i think)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Too wild, perhaps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might lose a lot of commentators if the spectators demand we use only one eye|pg||
nt|gambit: double now?|pg||
nt|mrdct: west with the 7th @s might bid 4@s now|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Debbie, when do the TD come with the ruling ?|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|dburn: no great loss|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: They have taken the notes to read|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: now is getting frisky|pg||
nt|mrdct: @H fit might be lost now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: north perhaps strategically suppressing his @h suit so as to not make it easy for EW to evaluate their @S fit|pg||
nt|sunsamvar:  the score shown in the zimmerman match is Z109- Strul 107|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
nt|ady: who ever plays goes down|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm not convinced 4@S isnt making|pg||
nt|gambit: Bjorn will double 4@H I suspect|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here a realy tough 4@h posible to bid for n/s, does not go well I think with this layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: they did well to find 2@H|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i'd be bidding myself every day of the week with that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they can take as long as they want to rule|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: not a tricky hand they are all laughing|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Vugraphzfd: Bertheau could he have spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: now no guess|pg||
nt|mikael_w: opps, that was NOT a good lead as you all can see|pg||
nt|mikael_w: thats the ONLY lead that makes this kontract have a chanse|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I can tell you, the commentary is going to be a lot more cautious when you can only see one hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 12 tricks made in the other room, so NS may have done will not to get involved|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont see 12 tricks unless north allowed himself to be endplayed|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: these days many pairs open super light and run away from P's penalty doubles|pg||
nt|ralfwil: difficult lead on S|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Vugraphzfd: Mike here's your stuff|pg||
nt|ady: ace and another heart 4@S has no chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: take the $$ in 8@H -- 4@S too close|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: taking a small break|pg||
nt|gambit: going to check on the kids in the room next door?|pg||
nt|mrdct: this will be a timely board for dekniff as it's been one-way traffic so far|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: no|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: a play has left the roon|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: player|pg||
nt|mrdct: seems odd to take a break in the middle of a board|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: the room is a warm 55 degree's and we have just found the thermastat to turn it up|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: well @H made 10 tricks in the closed room - so some hope for fleisher here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: player back got lost returning|pg||

nt|mikael_w: I think I take a ciggarett on this hand :) if nothing els then 3 NT = or +1 I will be supprised when I come back :)|pg||
nt|chick: they may still be bidding by the time Mikael gets back :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: looking at notes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: for defense|pg||
nt|mrdct: i find it quite amusing that they allow written defences at the table in this event|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: need version of option 2 |pg||
nt|gambit: well I guess the tempo (or lack thereof) will come into play - if the match is close and DK loses, I would expect an appeal ( not brazen enough to predict the outcome) |pg||
mb|2H!|nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Mr Pedant returns!  (Don't you hate it when he's right?)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We all do|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, can you have "fewer" than one?|pg||
nt|dburn: er,,, yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: David is BBO's language policeman|pg||
nt|hlortz: meanwhile do you like 3n? i am more inclined to raise on the void...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: dont like either the raise or 3nt|pg||
nt|gambit: pass?|pg||
nt|mrdct: no problems in 3NT here - but should north be getting involved in teh auction at these colours with 5-5 in the reds?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: lots of writing|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: maybe he wants to show short spades?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be 3@s giving shortness in @h to not give the possibility to dbl at opps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe they use steps for shortness|pg||
nt|mrdct: fredin having vague thoughts of a slam in @C?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: LMH  would be 3@H=short @D  3@S=short @H  3N=short @S|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|gambit: Bjorn, 3NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: that incline must be one heck of a tilt|pg||
nt|bjacobs: no entries, huh?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the crux is does 3@S show a truely solid suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Except maybe this one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @D10 is an entry :)|pg||
nt|gambit: W will bid 3@C (hopefully in tempo) |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: he should have something|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|gambit: was W's pass forcing?|pg||
nt|mrdct: this would usually be a lebensohl situation|pg||
nt|mrdct: but maybe their written defence doesnt mention lebensohl|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think so david|pg||
nt|gambit: yes, does W have enough for 3@c (constructive) no, so he should try 2NT, puppet to 3C |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: leads 3/5|pg||
nt|mrdct: you dont think it's normal to play lebensohl after a t/o double of a weak 2?|pg||
nt|gambit: leads, singleton....|pg||
nt|gambit: yes, of course|pg||
nt|gambit: leb is my favourite convention |pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: if West can't reopen impossible to have 12 tricks - right bid 3NT|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@H is probably quite a good save for NS|pg||
nt|gambit: 10 toppers|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what system are they playing ?|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|Walddk2: As Pierre Schmidt points out, West will have to give the entry later anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: how did 4@S go down 2 in closed room|pg||
nt|gambit: very tough for N to climb in at the 3 level, I doubt many would venture in, even at these colours or (heaven help us) Matchpoints|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: fourth best leads|pg||
nt|ady: must have been|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: sure looks like it...|pg||
nt|dinos1: depends what was X - GF? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: was alerted|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|gambit: poor communication |pg||
nt|mrdct: going for a x-ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is not in the written defense, which merely covers whether bids are takeout or penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: every single bid is alerted...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: yes|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and west has not bid @S nor East @Ds :):)|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|mrdct: so south will want to win this and play a trump|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: a very complicated route to 5@C|pg||
mb|5C|nt|sunsamvar: my grandmom wd have bid 1@D-1@S-2@C=5@C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @h lead will defeat 5@c on E|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: or my personal preference, "killing" leads and devestating switches|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dinos1: was told X showed 5-7zz :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Nystrom what did I show   Bertheau 5 3 0 5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sunsamvar: and Stansby found it|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bridge_one: however 4@h was a good defence|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but also take @sA, because the  @s can all be discarded on the @d|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bjacobs: For what it's worth, East should know the entire layout now, except for the precise diamonds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't suppose it's possible that West can refuse to get endplayed with a diamond?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'll shut up ... the comment makes no sense for those who can see all 4 hands|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good point and he can|pg||
nt|dinos1: A=3, K=2, Q=1 zz|pg||
nt|ady: can make 12 tricks  cash all minors and put north in with spade|pg||
nt|gambit: feeling noose tighten already |pg||
nt|mrdct: or not|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mrdct: south can overruff @s so declarer isnt home free yet|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if defense 1 in use, double= takeout of spades, and may include a direct lebensohl|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: use defense   2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense 2 is mostly natural and Lebensohl not mentioned|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think i like defence 1 better|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: Weinstein in 6@C East|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|gambit: Even he won't make it, unless they lead out of turn |pg||
nt|mrdct: and i'd try to pick a defence that is consistent with what i do vs weak 2s|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: that is not so clear.. let us see|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bjacobs: I'm in|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bjacobs: But should I do it?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|dinos1: @s endplay - for lead into @h teenace|pg||

nt|mrdct: some ugly breaks here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bjacobs: it's a bit early Martin :)|pg||

nt|mcphee: we welcome them Cameron|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/Vanderbilt2010/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof8  for 3/4 scores|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: now peter says never mind|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS have to try 3NT here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: missing the 3 nt spot on the previous bd might prove very costly for DeKnijff|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dinos1: hmm - he had top 11 tricks, why 10?|pg||
nt|mrdct: in 4@H can draw 1 round of trumps and then cross ruff|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: This match is obviously also over|pg||
nt|bridge_one: having DBL, 2Nt, 3@c it is sure E/W use different means at each bid|pg||
nt|mrdct: north feels that this must be his hand - but what can he do now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: shaking his head|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: there will be plenty of hands where 4@S is cold NS even with 5@S in west|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: he  Helgemo opened 1@D in 3rd|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hlortz: ive noticed helgemo, meckwell seem to play '3rd seat is forcing' rarely except vul vs not do they ever pass...|pg||
nt|ady: maybe playing too fast  lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: he is a passed hand must have 5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: will the club 8 win the second round of clubs :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Son and father have not had the best slam record lately, so ....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: will take a short break after this hand|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: In Thomas' BBO profile he even reads that he does not want to talk about slams|pg||
nt|mcphee: good lead|pg||
nt|gambit: like "I don't understand how declarer made only five spades. I understand why he wanted to make only five spades:it wouldn't be so obvious he missed a slam." |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: writes rather|pg||
nt|hlortz: blackwood with a worthless dbltn frowned on in some circles|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: East rightly prefers to play in weaker players suit|pg||
pc|c9|nt|gambit: 3NT too greedy without a filler in @d, but it makes the worlk go round and on a beter day the K@D would be on-side|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bjacobs: East will probably lead a minor|pg||
nt|mikael_w: a good lead for n/s, I think 10 tricks was posible without @d lead|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thomas is the son|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A trump is safe, but pointless|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'd lead a club myself|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: and what does that do|pg||
nt|hlortz: shouldnt south show the queen with 5 trump?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 118 to Strul and 109 to Z in the other match|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bjacobs: Finds partner with @CQ, and some slow entry?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: I think he should, Henry|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after the overcall by West the probability to find K in @d there are greater that in east|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: both matches going down to the wire|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|gambit: "his lead was the middle from the top of nothing." |pg||
pc|hT|nt|hlortz: or did he>  5@S is usualkly the Q|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Vugraphzfd: almost double you|pg||
nt|mrdct: @C never mentioned or lead in the other room|pg||
nt|gambit: new leader on the scoreboard storming back (i thought Bjorn might double this one too) if they stay, ......|pg||
nt|mrdct: north wants east to ruff this high|pg||
nt|mrdct: which east no doubt will|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bjacobs: I think he did show @HQ ... that's why the trump lead was completely safe|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||

nt|mrdct: east has already seen his screenmate's head shakes during the auction so expects bad breaks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now 10 tricks|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Ok!|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikael_w: but I cant see how n/s shod beat 480 here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe easier to rebid 1@S in context of Weak NT|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|po-s: fantastic lead|pg||
nt|kit: why do I think there is something about the North hand which doesn't exactly scream notrump?|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: comprisons for 8 to come up|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but at matchpoints the pointless heart lead avoids the overtrick|pg||

mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: yet another 1@C=2+|pg||

nt|mrdct: i wonder if that is a systemic 1NT opeing|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|mrdct: so after trailing 0-17, dekniff have racked up 28 imps in 3 boards|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: So did Helness but ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: different auction, though|pg||
nt|mikael_w: now it looks imposible to find the 5@d tho,|pg||
nt|dinos1: what's good in 5@d?|pg||
nt|mrdct: surprise surprise - i open 1NT with a singleton and partner transfers to it|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: now i have to scan notes :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: your right, maybe its 500 in 5 @d|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: fourth best attitude|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: no ruling|pg||
nt|mrdct: good to hear that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: probably will be after the 3rd quarter break|pg||
nt|mrdct: i assume "no ruling" means table result stands|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: no have not made ruling|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: oh i see|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: BUT 5@d NEEDS @s to split and 4@S does not (provided @Ca is right)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: unless finessing hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikael_w: it means TD has not say anything yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: got it|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: better deep one)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: sry ignore my previous comment|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gambit: got to be tempted for a grand with the E hand after partner opens and fit is found, tough to stay out |pg||
nt|ralfwil: but @s are 3-3 and you can ruff a @d for no loss|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 3/5 leads|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now easy.. wd have under pressure on @CQ lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks easy now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Vugraphzfd: lots of writin gby fredin|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can make 13 tricks also without finesse in @h|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Vugraphzfd: Bjorn sits up straight in chair|pg||
nt|gambit: can he trade the K@D for the Q@H?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ruffing 2@C and 1@d|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes 7@S looks makable|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but need to play seeing all cards :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 7@S in other room|pg||
nt|mrdct: i doubt this hand will be over before the top of the hour|pg||
nt|gambit: 7@s made there too wd |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 53 minutes on clock|pg||
nt|ady: I think 7 spades likely to go down   |pg||
nt|gambit: Tell that to Levin |pg||
nt|mikael_w: there is a risk that w plays a low @s now|pg||
nt|mcphee: he will need to finesse in @C again to bring this home if they find @D tap|pg||
nt|dinos1: now if def tap dcl with @d's and he tries ruff @c - W will put @h10|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not positive if exact shape known or just 4@S & 2@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Win @hA and ruff a @d and clean trumps|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mrdct: on what line david?|pg||
nt|ady: what line do you make it?|pg||
nt|mrdct: dummy reversal|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bridge_one: 7@S is very hard, but at the table can be made|pg||
nt|chick: W is not listening to you :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: ic :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bridge_one: with lead @s i think he will make|pg||
nt|mrdct: 9 top tricks here - but that will be about it i think|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mrdct: in the other room north bid 1@H which guided the play somewhat|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Peter now sits up|pg||
nt|gambit: No shyness here....|pg||
nt|mikael_w: there was a verry light opening from S. so you have to understand w for thinking @dK is in S hand|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bjacobs: Seriously, how do you guys play a double of 4@S in that auction?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The 4@S opening, I mean, not the overcall|pg||
pc|d6|nt|gambit: Will S lead a trump? I think so |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Pete says he has show 4 2 3 4 without Q of clubs|pg||
nt|mrdct: well there's no point leading a singleton to get a ruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Have i shown a maximum?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D lead looks most troublesome  but   is it a reasonable lead?  all depends upon what Fleisher knows about Fredin's shape|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: was told 4 2 3 4|pg||
nt|bridge_one: there are also the chance to play a double squeeze ruffing 2 @H in the dummy|pg||
nt|mrdct: might be able to scrounge an extra trick in @S but I think he'll run for the border|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: primarily penalty|pg||
nt|dinos1: well - S has only 10pc so @dK is rather in his hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes, and sadly his @S spots are not very strong|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Lew says ruffing|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Debbie|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bjacobs: I'm a takeout doubler myself, and it seems to me that Krekorian's hand was neither fish nor fowl|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And was therefore a pass (opposite a passed partner)|pg||
nt|mrdct: of course he doesnt know @C are breaking yet|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: have you played yet  no will play the jack eventually every one laughs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: lost 3 tricks?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: yes|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hlortz: mostly penalty . yes his hand seemed neither|pg||
nt|mrdct: he's not going to endplay anyone now|pg||

nt|gambit: North bid hearts DavPro tells me - well, that changes things just a little, another lesson, sometimes, certainly that hand, silence is golden |pg||
nt|mrdct: on the face of it this looks like game in either major for NS - but both majors break 4-1 so it might be tricky|pg||
mb|3D!|an|transfer|nt|dinos1: lucky 4@s|pg||
nt|ady: nice lay for 4@S e/w|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the unfavourable vul keeps Martel down to 2@S|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3@S wd have been a killer|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 4@H for NS but EW may compete to 4@S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: I think 2@H just LR+|pg||
nt|mrdct: with a 10 card @D fit, EW likely to save in 5@D|pg||
nt|mrdct: which is a great save given that it makes|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here 4 @s is even playable|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@S by west right now not unreasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikael_w: not easy to find in the bidding tho|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mrdct: EW might have snookered themselves though as NS might have bid to a failing 6@H contract left to their own devices|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: 118 to Strul and 134 to Z in the other match|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: in a dubious version, west hand is 2s bid|pg||
nt|dinos1: i wd say impossible)|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s only has 3 losers but the def will play @SA and another at some point to cut down the ruffs|pg||
nt|mikael_w: This looks like a realy well timed psyk|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but they have made it their own by omitting one  z|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: Mr Pedant went to sleep, so I have taken over|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are there 11 tricks?|pg||
nt|gambit: N bid 1@H over 1@c with his x Q9xxx Q9xxx xx, (last hand) - giving a blueprint to the opps, serves them right |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Mike this game is too Hard|pg||
nt|mrdct: they seem very chatty at this table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fleisher @DJxx complicates the play|pg||
nt|gambit: Sometimes I think we fail to appreciate how well these players play, it is a treat to watch |pg||
nt|ady: also doubleton club|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bjacobs: So the idea behind Gazilli is that after 1major 1NT (and other auctions), 2@C is either clubs or a strong hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i assume west actually bid 2d or 2s, not 3@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 3@D was the bid|pg||
nt|mrdct: looking at 6@h again - it may well make|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: That's not real Gazzilli then|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Typically, the lowest unbid suit in response shows the top of the 1NT range, and commits to game if opener has the strong hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S would be the bid|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
pc|cA|pc|sA|nt|bjacobs: Yes, no idea what 3@D means|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Less than 8, usually 2 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still no @D shift should help Fredin read the hand|pg||

nt|dinos1: def has time to open @s suit in time|pg||
nt|gambit: "this is a contract that would be justified only on success, and I have a feeling that it will not be."|pg||
nt|dinos1: for 3N shd have @c suit headed with AQJ at least|pg||
nt|gambit: 2C more fitting |pg||
nt|mrdct: if north shows up with @DAK declarer might play south for the @HQ|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|dinos1: I wd rebid 3@c/1N|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, 3 @c looks like a good bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: no explaination on king lead|pg||
nt|gambit: W knows the clubs are't running - why take a chance that N has 10xxx in @D?|pg||
nt|ady: maybe spade switch now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 27 min for four boards |pg||
nt|gambit: hopefulyy for the def...|pg||
nt|ady: north should win and grab 6 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: have just added 10 minutes total of 37 min warning to both pairs to play the rest of the boards|pg||
nt|dinos1: depends on meaning of @d signal|pg||

nt|gambit: better tahn his head on a silver platter|pg||

nt|ady: surely a spade looks right if uncertain of diamond position|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: jack of diamonds in his hand now|pg||
nt|dinos1: switch? and pd has @dQ and no @cA?|pg||
nt|chick: he has to worry that N has the @CA though|pg||
nt|gambit: if pard had Q he should unblock....but didn't for obvious reasons |pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, something is wrong in the bidding when a @h switsh now will result in 2 or 3 down :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: and only 3rd by NS|pg||
nt|mrdct: it  might be in norths interest to disclose some of his non-@H values|pg||

pc|h7|nt|gambit: which is why W had no urgency to unblock|pg||

nt|fabsayc: he can make on complete cross ruff|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mikael_w: soo, 3 down|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h6|nt|mrdct: he will also shortly discover that north has no @C so he'll play north for longer @H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kamill must discard a diamond now to give any problem|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Mike says sorry|pg||
nt|mrdct: awkward discard for north here - @D will mean @DJ sets up and @S will mean he wont be able to cash an established @S|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|mrdct: so what went wrong here for NS?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: thank you by Marty|pg||
nt|dinos1: has 2@h tricks now|pg||
nt|ady: dont think you need clubs 3-2  just king onside   can even overtake K@D to set up 3 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 120 to Strul and 134 to Z in the other match and 1900 specs in the open room|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a misunderstand about 3@d|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Vugraphzfd: upside down count  diamond attitude|pg||
nt|mrdct: at least 3 off here for -500|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gambit: Clearly N assumed natural, while S intended other....|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gambit: 4 down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: it happen|pg||
nt|dinos1: after setting 2@h tricks dcl can sqz S in @s-@d|pg||
nt|mrdct: so probably a couple of imps to DK - the 4th undertrick will pay well|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|c8|nt|bjacobs: With this "following a player" thing, you have to check the box "kibitz partner when dummy" ... just worked that out|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: In fect, only one USA team survive to the semi-finals. Strul has two European pairs, Fantunes and Brogeland-S√¶lensminde|pg||

nt|vugraphzff: Levin reviewing defense vs 2C|pg||
nt|mikael_w: so, 16 IMP 2 boards to go|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like easy 3NT, but the 2@C opener may cause problems due to unfamiliarity|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: they've already seen it TWICE today :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: A nice simple way to solve the problem|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Stansby only had choices of 1@D, 3@D or the one he chose .... PASS|pg||
nt|po-s: maybe 2D doubled in other room? faint hope for Swedish team|pg||

nt|mrdct: meanwhile the auction on 44 in the open room is progressive at a rate of 1 bid every 2 or 3 minutes|pg||
nt|mrdct: so breaks in tempo there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: one of the better accidents you have erver hand and laughs around the table|pg||
nt|mrdct: *no i meant|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|Walddk2: No mercy from Helgemo-Helness in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting point is initial DBL -- is it Takeout [of @H] or @H??|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: They did very well to penalise 2@C with just five between them, divided 3-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: They must have ... East doubled the runout ... once again, takeout or penalties?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well at worst they would chalk up -180, so not that risky|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|fabsayc: primarily penalty, very old fashion of me|pg||
nt|bjacobs: dreadfully :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I guess you are 90% sure @CQ is a trick, so as you point out, it's going to be -180 at worst, and with your easy lead, you are quite likely to beat it|pg||
nt|mrdct: barry goren opines, 3@h would have been 100% forcing so 4@h showed a mountain and @s bid KC. No way 4NT can be corrective|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I don't think Michel's pass is conventional|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It isn't|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after the raise in @s by East the dbl became for all table @h suit|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|gambit: Yes it does, even Tiger doesn't hit a hole in one on all the par threes - mistakes happen, and you have to stay out of the sand traps and water and hit the greens in regulation, ...|pg||
nt|gambit: sometimes you whack it into the forest or the pond. s**t happends and a new leader. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if 2@C=trf @D or like Gazzilli|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt now ?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: sure not gazzilli|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: writing explantion of what is 2clubs but I can not read it from here|pg||
nt|gambit: redouble?|pg||
nt|ady: this an easy 4@S|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@H the contract on 44 so 7 or 8 imps coming for DK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they stopped in 5@H on board 45|pg||
mb|d|nt|gambit: This is for the VuGraph commentators: "There are three right plays in bridge - what is correct in analysis, what works and what I would have done."|pg||
nt|mikael_w: guess 2 @h is GF, nice and easy bidding then to show distrub.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6@S here?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the Swedes have made small gain in the past few boards, but they need a big swing NOW|pg||
mb|r!|nt|bridge_one: if 2@C is long @D i think 3Nt correxct with AJxx|pg||
nt|gambit: wow! |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: time has expired clock dinging|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: These strong notrumps are just too dangeours|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Still, a minor runout is worth considering|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Casen 4th best!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: table chuckled|pg||
nt|janm: 2@d showed either 6 spades or a minimum 5(332) hand, 2@h asked, 2@s showed 6 spades|pg||
nt|dinos1: and what was 2@d?)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: undo|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4NT for minors or by north more likely|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: more writing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: common treatment when 2@C=2+ and 1@D=4+ UNBAL  is to play transfer rebids by opener|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c redoubled was probably going to make|pg||
nt|gambit: ok, that is better|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sunsamvar: 2000|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dinos1: good contract in MP/BAM|pg||
nt|ady: spade contract a little better|pg||
nt|janm: 2@c was game forcing, but might have longer diamonds|pg||
nt|mrdct: this looks cold as ice|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Still 120 to Strul and 134 to Z in the other match and now 2000 specs in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The entry to double finesse clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: spade is an entry??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless West ducks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But partner gave me an encouraging spade card at trick 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: @D is an entry too|pg||
nt|hlortz: unless casen plays pard for k108 he ought to duck|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh I see, declarer has AK10 or AQ10 ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: AK10|pg||
nt|hlortz: very good :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: @C Kx on side|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many ask about gazzilli 2@C - the 2@C gazzilli is played only after 1Maj open to give any strong hand or natural 12/16 with @c|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@C by west, therefore, probably wont make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that fits the auction perfectly -- and IS played by Fredin-Fallenius|pg||
nt|dinos1: why better? 3N by N is best|pg||
nt|mikael_w: will @c lead not end up only 630 ?|pg||
nt|ady: spades almost certainly 11 tricks   no-trump might be only 10|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: south is to have extras|pg||
nt|mrdct: ah - i had the vul wrong on 44 - new leader!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Nystrom thought two diamonds was game forcing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: eyes rolling on pass|pg||
nt|ralfwil: is this correct?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: lost of swedish talking|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: oops missed a cold game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: snapping cards down to table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: he is shaking his head|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Vugraphzfd: Peter this is bad news but is better not red|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And next comes a diamond up|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 1@D open the gazzilli isn't used - here 2@c have for sure a means, but i don't think similar at gazzilli layout|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bjacobs: Now I'm totally lost.  Declarer won @SA?  I guess I'm tired.  64 boards in a day ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: was perfectly safe, Bill|pg||
nt|mrdct: what a fantastic match we have here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart lead would have made it tougher|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: Last chance to beat it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Specs tell me I am being tempted into continuing spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bill?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, I've got several 100 wires here :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well what is it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think I'm meant to switch to hearts ... but I'm not sure I can find that in real life|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And I'm not allowed to take advantage of partner's huge pause over the spade 9|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: they certainly will be lot of discussions between the Swedes tonight|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: lots of|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h3|nt|mrdct: cash @SA and ruff 1 @C and pitch the other 2 on @DKQ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|hlortz: i think w would throw a @H if he held nothing inb the suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, and that spade pitch, wasn't it the highest spot card left?|pg||
nt|hlortz: but bill's point on the pause is well taken|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thomas Bessis is probably the world's best "still in his 20's player". Feel free to disagree|pg||
nt|hlortz: we havent seen much of him in th US yet but he's been impressive here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: We've seen him quite a lot on BBO in French events.  They are a fantastic partnership|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And on the Europe team in the Buffett Cup|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm not too surprised that they are in to the semis of the Vanderbilt.  Still, they do have good teammates :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: They play standard French almost nothing|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mrdct: perhaps someone should've doubled this|pg||
nt|dinos1: A|pg||
nt|dinos1: and cash winners|pg||

pc|c4|nt|mikael_w: nope. 630|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be 2@c different means after open in 3th site|pg||
nt|gambit: I guess W expected longer clubs and (possibly) a better hand, still, his bid was ......imaginative or weird, depending on one's perspective |pg||
pc|hK|nt|mrdct: only 50s|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|dinos1: now safe @d|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: Last board here.|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|bjacobs: Finally, our appreciation to the ACBL, in particular Jeff Johnston and Jan Martel for broadcasting this prestigious event. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: In just over 12 hours, the semi-finals commence|pg||
nt|hlortz: ah yes and the tireless Roland Wald who puts this show together|pg||
nt|bjacobs: tireless, and as far as I can tell, sleepless|pg||
nt|mikael_w: soo, this is the last board of this set, I guess the time will be same as the days before. Then we will have a break for about 1 hour and 45 min|pg||
nt|gambit: ty to the player, our VuG operator, commentators and of course most importantly - the specs -  next session approx 1 hour away. Is that about right? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: will restart probably at 8:00pm PST|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I may go for a kip now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need to find K sgl out |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I will confirm|pg||
nt|mikael_w: that is in 1 hour and 53 min from now right ?|pg||
nt|gambit: 11:00 pm EST last night so 60 _51 minutes|pg||

nt|dinos1: 4@s? :)|pg||
nt|gambit: 9:08 here|pg||
nt|mrdct: hard for west to act again here vul and a passed partner|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Tx to our wonderful operator Debbie who managed some difficult circumsatnces well|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes! 2nt as a strong rise to 3@h|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Been a pleasure commentating with you Ralf|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: 20 mins or so|pg||
nt|bjacobs: powernap|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So, Zimmermann vs Strul and de Knijff vs Fleisher in the semi-finals|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In exactly 12 hours from now|pg||
nt|ady: unless n/s can make 4@S  dropping sing King  looks like De Knijff will retain  a small lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikael_w: Here is a link to this tourney if you want to check the IMPs before next set starts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 8:00 pm will restart here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: intermediate bid|pg||
nt|mrdct: west endplayed already|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: double here just keeps auction alive, i.e. takeout|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: It's hard to commentate on this auction.  2@S ... was that a splinter?  Or some other form of raise?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: forcing raise i think|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and nothint else than 3@h from N|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: thanks all been a pleasure|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nothing..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: congrats to Fleisher|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sunsamvar: and Tx to all the specs for your comments and for watching :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: sorry about the crashes with the scores to start|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: par contract and an entry into the fianl for Lew and Chip... well done|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: final|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: to game, with 2nt as the limit raise, but just a guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: four rounds of hearts (eventually) will make this interesting|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: good 12 to bad 16 and 6 card suit|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bjacobs: So, enough of science, wheel out Old Trusty|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mikael_w: Thx to my fellow comentators and to all kibz and special thanks to Debbie for a great job as usual|pg||
nt|dinos1: why not direct 4@s then?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: tomorrow|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: at 12:00|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|mikael_w: I know 3 @d was home this time, But NEXT time its not that sure|pg||
nt|mrdct: if south was declarer and hadn't disclosed such @S length, you could work on the theory that if @SJ isn't covered the K is offside and then play for the drop - but with J109 in ...|pg||
nt|mrdct: dummy that theory wont work|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|gambit: declarer will guess the spades (after all the red suit bidding by W) and quickly append 420 to his side of the balance sheet |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: best line on this lead, suggestions?|pg||
nt|po-s: finesse trumps...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart finesse, or heart ace and go for discards|pg||
nt|hlortz: on the bidding @D are 6-1 so no worries|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in about 12 hours from now, Debbie ?|pg||
