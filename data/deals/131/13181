nt|hedyg: gazilli would work well here|pg||
nt|fann4: They got to 5@C other table after a 2@H rebid.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would bid 2 @C on the first round,  (yes I know have 6 hts) |pg||
nt|han: Westra has a difficult decision|pg||
nt|han: I must admit I would have bid 2C instead of 2H|pg||
nt|fann4: Me too.|pg||
nt|hedyg: that @c suit is certainly good enough to bid|pg||
nt|han: don't really understand 2H with these suits, but in old school you have to rebid your major with a minimal 6-4|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe they do not have to have 4 to bid it |pg||
nt|fann4: And the @H suit is weak enough to not have to rebid.|pg||
nt|hedyg: over 2@c by S N could have bid 2@s etc|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|hedyg: ok so lets try 3@s now|pg||
nt|han: 3S keeps 3NT in the game|pg||
nt|sybarra: and one suggestion is that N could bid 2 @C  over 1 ht |pg||
nt|han: I think Bertens will bid 3NT, he has told his story|pg||

nt|han: so he'll be happy here, spades or diamonds|pg||

pc|c5|nt|athene: Well, they will still gain imps for down one - West in the other room definitely took her eye off the ball|pg||
nt|athene: got the @HJ lead and tried the @HQ, so north got three ruffs|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|han: This looks like down 1, good save for EW as Wortel is unlikely to find the low club lead necessary to beat 4H!|pg||
nt|han: it also gives the same score as 3NT-2 at the other table|pg||
nt|han: I'm surprised that Begas did not act over 3NT by the way|pg||
nt|fann4: Presumably the @H3 cannot be from Q543|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H hard to read?|pg||
nt|han: maybe the colors made him pass, he figured that if he could make a game, 3NT was probably doing down quite a bit|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fann4: This is a bit tricky. N is thinking about building a @C trick before the @SA goes.|pg||
nt|hedyg: passed the ball to Jansma|pg||
nt|fann4: On the underlead S now 'knows' N has the @SA|pg||
nt|hedyg: smallest @H probably asking for a @c return|pg||
nt|fann4: Right - and the suit preference implication.|pg||
nt|han: the underlead might have been necessary, picture declarer with a singleton spade and Qx of clubs|pg||
nt|fann4: Declarer coulbd be 1-2-8-2|pg||
nt|fann4: could...|pg||
nt|han: south would have to return a club to defeat it two tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes good defensive play by Paulissen|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s6|nt|athene: I think the best chance for south to beat this by two, is to attack in clubs - play three rounds of clubs giving a ruff/discard|pg||
nt|athene: then hold up in trumps with the intention of leading a fourth club and getting trump control|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|athene: it might not quite work as the cards lie, but that's the general sort of strategy you follow against a 4-4 fit when you have Axxx trumps|pg||
nt|athene: and South has almost that|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|helene_t:  If dummy ruff clubs twice, S will make @h9|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: yes and if declarer ruffs one club in each hand, south gets a long heart|pg||
nt|helene_t:  oh now she played @h10 anyway|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|hedyg: doesnt matter what card Jansma plays, Paulissen knows what is going on|pg||
nt|fann4: Claiming time!|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|h2|pc|c3|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: leading the @H10 looks a bit odd - no way you can pin a singleton @H9 in south's hand after the 1nt opener|pg||

nt|poohbear: Fee you at this table?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: true :) but rebidding 1nt with a singleton in partner's suit is more common than opening 1nt with a singleton i think|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: yep :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|helene_t:  yes of course|pg||

mb|3C|nt|han: good result for EW in the other table, 3NT not yet made but with the @hKQ onside it probably will|pg||
nt|han: Wortel will invite and Schollaardt will accept, I'm sure :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|helene_t:  yes, but N doesnt have the values to double 2@h and S doesn't have the shape for it|pg||

nt|poohbear: @h lead for the money|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|fann4: Impossible to go down here.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|han: good try, small spade, but it doesn't look like it will yield here|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|athene: it's a low-level contract; you have trump control - probably there's no great urgency to get busy doing things|pg||
nt|helene_t:  declarer will probably discard a club on the diamonds so she doesnt have to guess the clubs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|han: a spade return will certainly make Schollaardt nervous but there is little he can do but finesse in diamonds and hearts|pg||
nt|athene: yes, the defence can't organise to put her to a guess in clubs|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|athene: with north having no side entry|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|poohbear: opps might not be able to take 5 tricks anyway|pg||
pc|d6|nt|poohbear: a low @c now is best but declarer can still make by playing off winners and conceding tricks rto north who will have to give dummy the 9th trick|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|hedyg: if Jansma thought N had an entry to his hand a @s back would work better than a @c switch|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|c6|pc|d8|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|c3|nt|poohbear: back to the straight @c guess. Declarer runs winners and in the 4 card ending keeps Qx   KJ  and leads a @c|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: unlucky 6@D here|pg||
nt|poohbear: Of course there really isnt a guess since South would always rise ace and cash a @s and put a @H thru |pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|han: This could become interesting|pg||
nt|han: white against red there is no stopping Schollaardt with a suit like this|pg||
nt|han: Double by north will show values|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 6nt will make if north takes the @SA too soon as she will get squeezed in spades and diamonds, even assuming declarer doesn't pick the diamonds|pg||
nt|poohbear: havent seen a 9-11 NT in a long time!|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|fann4: As you said earlier Han 'When in Holland".... do as the Dutch do.|pg||
nt|sybarra: same auction as other table |pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d major 1suiter?|pg||
nt|han: Paulissen takes a more direct approach|pg||
nt|fann4: I'm referring to super light weak 2 openings you discussed.|pg||
nt|han: there doesn't seem to be any lead that challenges declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: 3-3 breaks in the pointed suits make it easy.|pg||
nt|han: this is not easy for declarer, if east has Kx or Qx then it is better to play low|pg||
nt|hedyg: J@h makes it even easier|pg||
nt|han: so that the suit blocks|pg||
nt|fann4: @HJ is the 10th trick, and finally E will have to give a @C trick for 11 tricks.|pg||
nt|han: that might be necessary if west has the club ace|pg||
nt|han: playing low and taking the ace at trick 1 would be the way to go then, but now it is the way to go down|pg||
nt|hedyg: better assume W has 2 honours in @H for his bid|pg||
nt|fann4: Playing low is still ok. He can duck the @H and later still make 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|hedyg: can he if W has the A@C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably trying to figure out if Schollardt would lead low holding kqxxxxx |pg||
nt|han: if he plays for Kx or Qx he has to win trick 1 with the ace|pg||
nt|fann4: But looking at it single dummy it has some problems.|pg||
nt|han: with spades and diamonds 3-3 he'll still make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|han: very dangerous problem|pg||
nt|han: What's more likely, that west has KQxxxx or either Kxxxxx or Qxxxxx?|pg||
nt|han: the 2 shows an even number with at least one honor|pg||
nt|hedyg: KQ|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: it looks as though 2@D was not game-forcing for either EW pair here|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise west would surely bid 2nt or 3@D over 2@S|pg||
nt|helene_t:  yes, they play Acol|pg||
pc|d4|nt|han: with K109 or Q109 he would have led higher|pg||
nt|hedyg: or an odd nr with no honours|pg||
nt|sybarra: he can not see 9 yet  now closer |pg||
nt|han: I think so too Hedy, good decision by Jansma|pg||
nt|poohbear: I assume 2@d was a transfer. I dont like transfers playing weak NT cause it gives next hand 2 chances to get into the auction|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|poohbear: 4@h makes by force 5@h tricks 2@d 2@c and 1@s |pg||
nt|poohbear: so as long as declarer pulls trumps no worries|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pg||
pc|hA|nt|poohbear: The open room EW has an EXCELLENT mathpoint result|pg||
nt|poohbear: -400 will beat all the -420s and 450s|pg||
nt|poohbear: not as good at imps|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: even if declarer leads a spade to the @SK early it doesn't really help her all that much|pg||
nt|helene_t:  4NT quantitative, E can pass but with two points more than she already showed she must bid 6|pg||
nt|athene: she doesn't want to risk another one because then she would go down if south ducked @SAJx and diamonds might be breaking all the time|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|han: I think we can rule out the case of ann odd number without honors Hedy, Maarten is crazy but wouldn't bid on five small hearts|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hedyg: falsecarding by both opps on @s?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: mnot the cash |pg||
nt|sybarra: *now |pg||
pc|h3|pc|s2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: now the question is whether declarer can strip-squeeze north|pg||
pc|h8|nt|poohbear: Declarer still Ok to draw trump. @s ace stops the force|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s3|nt|athene: she has to put the @SA onside|pg||

mb|1N|an|!|nt|han: could be a bad hand for slam (not with A AK)|pg||
nt|han: depending on agreement|pg||
nt|poohbear: but common position when you have sure trump tricks. Dont overruff with your sure trump trick|pg||
mb|2S|nt|shevek: weak NT is a winner here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: in 2/1,  you do not need to jump,   so 3 @S shows sp support,  start the cue bidding pard....|pg||
mb|3H|nt|poohbear: I am told 9-11  and a singleton common for the NT opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|han: Marjolein, the wife of Maarten Schollaardt, is sitting next to me now|pg||
nt|han: so pardon me if we are a little biased|pg||
nt|han: double of 1D is "takeout", not penalty|pg||
nt|hedyg: not a strong t/o ..|pg||
nt|fann4: Can't see what N can do but pass|pg||
nt|han: Paulissen has both majors so he'll want to compete, Jansma has shown interest in competing in the majors|pg||
nt|hedyg: is he thinking psyche maybe?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: He passed, but as we are playing with screens I have to enter bid by 2 at the time, for NE and SW|pg||
nt|sybarra: great club partial, I so not see 3nt making by ew|pg||
nt|shevek: a more agressive south could've doubled 1@d|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: ok ty Monique|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I  might be wrong |pg||
nt|shevek: I think they pplay strong NT in 3rd|pg||
nt|athene: you mean if east opened 1NT you think that would stop north? surely north is balancing 2@H on the auction 1!N - 2@D; 2@H passed round to her?|pg||
nt|helene_t:  yes, we saw E opening 1NT on 17 in 3rd|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, as it happened in OR|pg||
nt|shevek: my guess is Fuller will bid 4@s|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|helene_t:  may make if she doesnt get  a diamond lead|pg||
nt|helene_t:  3@d shows a good spade raise, 3@s would have been weaker|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: *so =do not |pg||
nt|han: this is not a good partial, down after a heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: @h lead?|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm|pg||
nt|han: but now it makes with an over|pg||
nt|han: this could be good or bad|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree, the @H lead kills 3 nt |pg||
nt|athene: i think 3@H is a better bid|pg||
nt|shevek: re-wind pls|pg||
nt|athene: because north can't possibly want to bid 3@H naturally here but she might want to bid 3@D naturally|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Fuller appears astonished|pg||
nt|shevek: oops|pg||
nt|athene: suppose north has seven solid diamonds and nothing else|pg||
nt|athene: south sorry|pg||
nt|helene_t:  yes 3@h would be less prone to misunderstanidng|pg||
nt|athene: she would bid like this wouldn't she?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|athene: when you have two cue-bids available, choose the one that partner really, really won't pass|pg||

nt|poohbear: after trumps were 3-2|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: declarer in 3nt in the other room took a few wrong views, but the hand isn't trivial|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: We are starting to build an audience Fee :) up to 18 !! at this rate we might get to 21 by board 16 :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|shevek: the secret is to avoid playing in your long suit :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: lol yay :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|helene_t:  3@c asking for a 5-card major|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@c natural|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|helene_t:  3@d shows a 4-card major but denies a 5-card major|pg||
nt|athene: declarer set off on diamonds but then changed her mind and went over to hearts|pg||
nt|shevek: so south is marked with at most 3-3 in the Maj|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: @SA, small diamond taken by east with the @DQ, spade to the @SJ|pg||
nt|shevek: might run out of entries to dummy if she plays in @d|pg||
nt|athene: you can come to nine tricks by getting either hearts or clubs right|pg||
nt|shevek: exactely|pg||
nt|athene: yes, after the @SJ held in the other room declarer realised that even if she got those diamonds set up, she wasn't necessarily reaching them|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: yep|pg||
nt|poohbear: I guess Drury isnt popular in Oz|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|poohbear: Drury is 2@c bid by Passed hand over 1M to show 3 + support for the major and a near opening bid|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|athene: she might be able to get a count on the hand|pg||
nt|athene: if she can play two rounds of diamonds and cash the @CAK |pg||
nt|athene: leave the hearts to the end|pg||
nt|athene: you will find out east has 5-2-4-2|pg||
nt|athene: of course the @CQ drops then anyway so it will be easy if you kept the @CJ|pg||
nt|athene: but there are ways you might go wrong - for example, you might try to drop the @H10 intending to fall back on the club finesse if it doesn't work|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: so cash @HA, then lead to @HQ|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|athene: and if hearts are unhappy, you cash the @SK and play a club to the @CJ|pg||
nt|athene: but that's the sort of thing you leave right to the end |pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer going for the complete crossruff|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: it looks normal to fiddle around vaguely in diamonds as long as you can|pg||
