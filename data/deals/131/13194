pc|sK|nt|jallerton: and 6@c is worse played by South|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree. Both jaws is on N|pg||
nt|jallerton: A spade lead looks most likely|pg||
nt|jallerton: forcing declarer to finesse at trick 1|pg||
nt|xenya: best lead -- unbid suit, that simple|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards for all participants are online|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2010/OpenWom/systems.html|pg||

nt|ralfwil: too bad communications to aviod tge @s finess|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: EW leads are 1-3-5 against trumph and 2.4. against nt|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the @s finess|pg||
nt|jallerton: It's a shame Roland isn't playing in the Danish Teams.  I'm sure he'd be in this one!|pg||
nt|xenya: presents declarer with a club trick but gains a vital tempo|pg||
pc|h3|nt|santyclz: Ouch, 3nt by s is a lot easier.|pg||
nt|jbgood: and game in @h - one of the denominations available to get the gaqme bonus|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! a typical Roland:)|pg||

nt|jbgood: 12 of the 14 imps difference was the starting point - as a carry over from a previous encounter|pg||
nt|xenya: well done by NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: ready for actionboard :)|pg||
nt|othered1: This may be fun, depending upon who gets hung first by the misfit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bbo is set up to make this look like team match, but actually a PAIR event|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 tables in play, scored against datum|pg||
nt|poohbear: well we move from a small slam to a grand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both of these pairs use multi-purpose opening 2-bids -- most everything else is natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lilley-Nagy strong NT  Delivera-Robinson ACOL with Weak NT|pg||
nt|mwigor: hi al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome back Michael!|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|peacokk: EW better stay low on this one|pg||
nt|jbgood: the Blakset lead is a carry over from previous encounter|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: NS playing 5card major and 15-17nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: EW plays 5-card major and 14+-17 nt|pg||
nt|jbgood: if N can get to know that Auken has a 5 card @d suit - difficult if Fredin jumps in|pg||
nt|xenya: we are in for a bit of fun here i think |pg||
nt|othered1: 7 needs a little luck in @D|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzey: 3@h = 10-12 and 3@s|pg||
nt|jallerton: EW play strong NT, NS play weak NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d = 5+@c and eighter invitational to game or invitational to slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2nt = minors|pg||
nt|othered1: may turn out to be a test of NS's countermethods to unusual NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I guess NS plays 3@c from North = I have my own suit and I want to bid at least game|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@s = I have my @s-suit|pg||
nt|othered1: Most pairs play something along the lines of "unusual/unusual" where minor suit bids distinguish hands with major suit lengths.|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer has to decide how to play @ds in the grand. percentage is to take the finesse since there arent enuff entries to ruff 3@ds|pg||
nt|poohbear: dbl shows the majors I suspect|pg||
nt|othered1: I see four entries in @C|pg||
nt|poohbear: you are right|pg||
nt|poohbear: so ruffing out the suit is correct|pg||
nt|poohbear: makes the grand about 68%  well worth bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|othered1: Yes it is, if you are sure the opponents will be in small slam.  For whatever chance they aren't, increases the odds you need on the grand|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: indeed -- what should N do now -- would 3@H be forcing -- or should he double or cuebid first|pg||
nt|xenya: so cuebid it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@h directly after 2nt is not forcing -- but 3@c is forcing with own suit - 3@d would have been forcing with @s support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: according to CC   1@C supposed to be  any 15+ |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: this is the longest Ive ever seen it taken to go 1c/1h/1s|pg||
nt|poohbear: Very few partnerships have adequate methods to deal with 2@c interference|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: maybe 2@h shows a weak NT type hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: sr I cant explain 2@h and 2@s ... South has not asked W yet :(|pg||
nt|jallerton: http://www2.bridge.dk/Systemkort.aspx?ID=375 for convention cards|pg||
nt|xenya: that didn't get them too far, did it|pg||
nt|othered1: if that's a cue-bid, not simply showing @H with game values (my method)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = FG, 25+BAL or weak 2@H/@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: the double by N paid off|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=9+ HCP 5+@S|pg||
mb|6C|nt|ahollan1: hmmm in that context, seems 2@S should be weak 2@S opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: 4nt = 1430 |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 5@c = one ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@h shows only 3-card @c ... and a weak nt-hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: I was close!|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: yes ... you are good :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, makes sense -- 3@C shows @Hs, 3@D would show a spade fit|pg||
nt|othered1: On the auction, 4@H is high enough.  With quiet EW's might get quite a bit higher|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: yes and 3@h natural nonforcing and 3@s natural support nonforcing|pg||
nt|mwigor: think you're looking at the wrong system card al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh -- Richman-Peake are EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok    1@C=2+   1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|mwigor: 1@h did in fact show @s though|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not easy to see how many tricks declarer can take|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peake was south last set   AND  i have dain bramage|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: looks like Nagy is using the same Convention Card that I am :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: one of the least discussed aspects of partnership|pg||
nt|othered1: Many partnerships use the pass over the double to show some values, redoubliing with a double-negative.|pg||
pc|hJ|mc|13|nt|vugraphzey: NS leads 1.3.5.|pg||
nt|poohbear: this should wrap easily. Could Gill have bid 7? Hard to imagine that you are off an ace when partner leaps to slam|pg||
nt|othered1: If that's your agreement, it's reasonable to play suits by responder as natural.  Here north could show values and @D simply by bidding 2@D.|pg||

nt|xenya: we need a new board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we have a very small group in this room -- holler if there's anything special you want me to rant about|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Thus letting the double work for the opener's side.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: there are 2 ways to play 1@C-1@H:1@S/1N   some say 1@S=3@S [1N is weak NT with 2@S]  others  1@S=2/3@S so 1N becomes 17-19 or 18-20 [stronger than 1N opener]|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|othered1: Steve Robinson -- "always open a 5-card major" -- wouuld approve of south's action.   But most players would open this hand 1@H, if they open at all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S normally 5+ --- but this is great lead director in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: 2@h= 12-15hcp and natural|pg||
mb|1H|nt|othered1: if they open with a natural 1-bid, that is.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|jallerton: trump lead should be on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I guess @c K|pg||
nt|ahollan1: CC doesn't describe the passed hand 2N -- but sure looks like they are NOT playing Drury|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N not forcing  [not sure if that is same as Semi-Forcing]|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: I got it|pg||
nt|jallerton: did you have inside information, Jan?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzey: me ... nooo|pg||
nt|othered1: can I assume double was penalty-oriented?|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: The controversial 3-card raise.  I like it.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jbgood: the low club lead may induce N to continue the suit.. |pg||
nt|peacokk: Will Konow be able to read @C3?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: W said: "Make some room for these" when he put down the @ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: dbl = penalty|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: but South is a chicken and pull to 3@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW standard signals|pg||
nt|ahollan1: concensus is 2N=max with 3@S    that's the bid that Drury handles with 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Michael is abandoning us for one of Women's tables|pg||
nt|poohbear: Neill treating his hand as 5-6?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Trump split doesn't help this, but favorable @H position may be useful.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jbgood: some like it, I prefer 4 card raise unless no other bid..|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, all|pg||
nt|xenya: hello again|pg||
nt|othered1: @S position isn't necessarily clear to east.  Couldn't south be 2=5=1=5?|pg||
nt|othered1: Of coiurse, east is thinking about lots more than the play to this trick.|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I have been told that the open room "crashed" -- but now we are back - but this board has been played - and South won 8 tricks|pg||
nt|poohbear: It will be hard for him to imagine his partner is 4-7|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: many lead the second best from a bad suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: NS leads are 2.4.|pg||
nt|jbgood: second from top i mean|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: but later in the "game" they play 2.4. with attitude -- so then they play 2. from 4 bad ones|pg||
nt|othered1: Certainly a possible result|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Although this may not be the poster-child hand for it.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you want  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/    lets you spy on ALL ongoing vugraph matches -- one window per table|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Looks like it, but it isn't 6-5 and could be costly if partner had thoughts of going on.|pg||

nt|poohbear: not sure what NT range EW are playing but I am sure Gill is not evaluating it as weak|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder what Steve Robinson would say about that 1@D opening -- he espouses that not opening a 5-card major denies holding one.  So with things like 5=1=0=7, he'd open 1@S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk11: They should be spanked|pg||

nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||

nt|frankaus: this is Match 3/9 to decide the aust open team top 3 of 10 pairs will form a team|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but i would bid 2@S now, a kind of pass the buck bid|pg||
nt|frankaus: many play it here |pg||
nt|poohbear: These auctions are very tuff on the dbling pair. Need very solid agreements as to whats what|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reynolds wondering about 2@H vs DBL|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood:   1 was duplicated both biddingwise and resultwise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or .... delayed Splinter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other rooms will have same problem but after 1@S or 2@S opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kanektar started with DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the "match" score is an illusion.  This is a PAIR event but BBO handles teams better than pairs|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would pass and reopen 3@cs with a dbl when it came around to me|pg||
mb|3C|nt|frankaus: 2@C both Majors is a good method IMO , allows u to bid 2@D with no real preference of 2M with a pref, of 2Nt if game interest or better|pg||

nt|fabsayc: a unilateral penalty double in front of the length is so rare as to not be worth using|pg||
nt|poohbear: Gill has to be worried about pushing them to a makeable game|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: with such a sparce hand, i hadn't considered 4@D - especially if EW play that 2@S can be passed|pg||
nt|poohbear: I guess thats a safer way to play|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|poohbear: thats why he isnt competing|pg||
nt|othered1: That's a good  treatment (what I use, also).|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jallerton: South may try the effect of @sJ or @SK here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Difficult lead for S|pg||
nt|jallerton: his heart pips do not make that suit attractive|pg||
nt|xenya: @HQ now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: @h Q is taken and put back again|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Jens is certainly thinking about @h Q|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Sorry, lost the play here.|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: I'll give you the result :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think I'd try @CQ -- but no lead automagic|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and @C other than Ace :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: You was right Jeffrey!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in OZ - do your ACOL players say 2/1 is forcing to a certain level, or can opener's rebid be passed?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nagy-Lilley using upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Dwayne Hoffman|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just no small @S :)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|frankaus: G'day Dwayne|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but still 9 tricks|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzey: south is thinking.....|pg||
nt|jbgood: he may go down now, but when the spade ten came to light I think he might just have played trumps|pg||
nt|keylime:  greetings all from Manassas Park, VA - nice to be here|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: oh my, derailed now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi Dwayne|pg||
nt|poohbear: as it turns out he cant even make 3@H|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jbgood: losing 2 spades and a club|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 club ruffs available|pg||
nt|jbgood: but difficult for N to see?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Everybody agree with 4@h?|pg||
nt|frankaus: scoring is IMPs V a mean datum of the middle 3 tables|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Richman 'sounds like u have a good hand partner good luck'|pg||
pc|c5|nt|peacokk: Yes, it was|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: imo -- the auction screamed for a trump lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play Weak NT throughout -- so that would NOT apply to 1@S-2x:2N |pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: W needs to learn more about the hand and the @HQ looks fairly safe at this point|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was that really Q@H operator?|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|frankaus: of the 5 in play the extreme scores are disregarded in calculationg the mean|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|vugraphzey: will it be 1100|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Nagy probably thought that Robinson's 4@H was a working @H honor rather than shortness|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|poohbear: Declarer will have no problem guessing @cs but will still lose 5 tricks|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: W's heart discards suggested @S values|pg||
pc|hT|nt|keylime:  So, Frank, they are not cross-imped per se, correct?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|xenya: E's rather|pg||
nt|xenya: but E has to unblock now to avoid getting endplayed |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I am not absolutely sure if I made a mistake on the last @h play -- It might be that E played @h 8 instead of @h 5 ... sr all if that might be the case|pg||
nt|xenya: is that so obvious?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer can make this simply by splitting out the trumps|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzey: speed up time @cJ :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: obviously Delivera was on same page as Robinson|pg||
nt|frankaus: the match scores shown here are only score between the the two featured matches |pg||
nt|frankaus: no|pg||
nt|frankaus: the datum can be a real wildcard I hate it but what is the alternative?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i totally disagree with keeping two clubs, what purpose does it serve|pg||
nt|keylime:  Frank, is this the standard method for Australia in choosing a team?|pg||
nt|frankaus: there is a carry forward from the relevant 10 board match played in stage 1|pg||
nt|poohbear: perhaps declarer might have gone up @h ace to block the suit if North had Hx|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: unlike the previous 2 boards -- this hand is just a matter of overtricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can but that is also potential suicide|pg||
nt|poohbear: but opts to go for safety first " knowing " the @d ace is onside |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|jbgood: i like 4 @h|pg||
mc|8|nt|poohbear: but they retained the @d ace as a further entry so that play would fail|pg||

nt|xenya: considering that the auction may well be duplicated in the other room, this might not be all that bad |pg||

nt|ahollan1: ouch|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|jallerton: If South responds 1@S that will slow West down|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer took the percentage play. Assuming he thought North had a @h honor|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: or 1@h transfer|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 1@h = transfer|pg||
nt|jallerton: 4+@s|pg||

nt|vugraphzey: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: and might have longer @d suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: or longer @c suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: again 2@H is NOT automatic game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nagy has a few options  because of  a) strong 6@S  b) 3@H & void c) good 2nd suit|pg||

nt|jallerton: 2@h was brave|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@d = natural - normally longer @d|pg||
nt|poohbear: 1NT denies 3@h and shows a weak NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: ns plays 1nt as 12-14 in first and second seat .... and 15-17 in third|pg||
nt|peacokk: oh, sorry|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like 3@h is the limit for EW|pg||
nt|jallerton: now West justified to jump to game|pg||
nt|xenya: i've seen people doing that over and over again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gosney only bid 4@C  and Hans-Nunn bid a grand .... but 7N down 1 won't score well at all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@C-6@D:6@H   just maybe |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S by Reynolds is part of the YBYSIBM System|pg||
nt|ahollan1: You Bid Your Suit  I Bid Mine|pg||
nt|poohbear: Gill giving the opps one more shot at bidding game. But normal to reopen|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I don't play hands well enough to be able to afford that|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: duplication is difficult when W opens 1nt in the other room (playing weak nt) :)|pg||
nt|xenya: however that was not to happen -- N doubled in the other room|pg||
nt|poohbear: wouldnt be my choice but might be dictated by system|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would bid 2@c if able|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  only 2@H/@S are natural|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: mouse problem it was a low @H to Ace :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: remember this isn't really a team match --- the Australian Trials [aka Playoffs] is run as a PAIR event|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|othered1: I'd bid onemore on west's hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: me too|pg||
nt|othered1: My partners don't solo to the 3-level to give the opponents numbers.|pg||
nt|poohbear: looks like down 2 unless the defnse loses their @d ruff. Declarer still needs to pick up @ds by leading high twice out of his hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: pins the 10|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzey: you couldnt know :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzey: 2@c is forcing 2@d .. and now 2@h is invit with 5+@h|pg||
nt|xenya: instead of 1NT|pg||
nt|othered1: Isn't this now cold?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so -- we only know what ONE of the other pairs has done    there are actually 8 tables in play|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: easy 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jallerton: South had to lead a @d to beat this I think|pg||
nt|poohbear: We can certainly make a case for dbling with the East hand over either 1 or 2 @s|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: lots of guessing here, but i think Reynolds will have to place @CQ in West and one honor in @H|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: kudos to Robinson for the pressure bid of 5@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we can see 13 are available, but Lilley will take his time to find best line for TWELVE tricks|pg||
nt|frankaus: Andrew Peake is a well regarded partner, very calm, but often really sneeky, NS a real dangerous opps|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @d lead had been better|pg||
pc|s4|nt|peacokk: Interesting lead|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jallerton: (or let his partner lead a club out of turn)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another solution:)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: and we'll never know if Robinson would have given Delivera a @C ruff against 7@H :(|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
nt|poohbear: now the defense should get their ruff|pg||
pc|d2|nt|poohbear: or perhaps not :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|poohbear: this should make given the luicky @d lie|pg||
nt|poohbear: though now declarer has opened a potential @h threat|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south can count the hand and lead a low diamond now|pg||
nt|poohbear: tricky 2 of @ds might not work so well|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kiwibridge: most would just claim 9 and save time|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pitch hearts|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|poohbear: dunno why he did that|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|poohbear: could play @cs just as easily from hand|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: now - don't even need to guess @H --- well done|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d7|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h6|nt|poohbear: so down 1|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: that will work, but not sure it is best line to guarantee the slam   i was still working thru options :(|pg||
nt|frankaus: David Lilley played in a long term partnership with Ron Klinger - highly regarded, |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mwigor: did EW actually get any tricks?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jbgood: out of the ordinary - i think a simple spade lead is the long term winner|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|djneill: that was a difficult choice of leads - 3-3 in the unbid suits, he chose the @c rather than the 3 good @h|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|ahollan1: @H|pg||
nt|mwigor: pitch on @c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All 13. 7 spades, 5 clubs, 1 diamond|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you're right -- should be 13 tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|santyclz: Yes.  Fredin knew it too, but was able to talk himself out of it...|pg||
nt|jallerton: EW should buy this in 2@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gill made a Lightner double of 7@H which made Hans run to 7N|pg||
nt|keylime:  Dan, if you were to lead hearts for some reason, probably the J@h hits the table?|pg||
nt|djneill: right|pg||
nt|keylime:  2@d the multi here it looks like|pg||
nt|poohbear: catherine|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: looks like EW make 3@D/@H so could be a swing here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jbgood: game on for both sides - even a slam EW:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@s = 8-10 and 3@s|pg||
nt|othered1: I think he had time to play south for 2@H and @DAxx.|pg||
nt|djneill: playing against this kind of multi, you don't worry about the 25+ GF bal variety, what is it like 30-1 odds against?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Lets see how Ebery deals with this|pg||
nt|poohbear: p p |pg||
nt|poohbear: I think|pg||
nt|poohbear: undo Catharine|pg||
mb|d|nt|poohbear: I play 1@s as natural in this spot|pg||
nt|poohbear: and dbl as TO|pg||
mb|2C|nt|keylime:  Here's a bid that depending where one is in the world, it is either very common, or like here in North America, very tightly regulated with prepared defenses required by the pair using it|pg||
nt|keylime:  I think more than that Dan - suspect it's over 40-1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: at least 500-1 against the 25+|pg||
nt|frankaus: Little Old Ladies use it here at most clubs|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2+@C|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kiwibridge: back again|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: dbl for 500?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@H = transfer to @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Easier to find @hQ without that @h10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Delivera PASS??    if not opening weak NT -- why not 1@H [showing 4+]|pg||
nt|poohbear: Gold might just force this to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: RDBL=4+@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but perhaps easts only chance to play against @dQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N then Nagy gets to flip a coin|pg||
nt|keylime:  And here they have changed the regs so that you can not use it at at in most situations; think they tagged a 12 board requirement for acceptable use|pg||
nt|fabsayc: totally disagree with doubling 2h, that should be takeout of hearts|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2NT here should be take out|pg||
nt|othered1: 4-3-3-3 double that most players seem to  make today|pg||

nt|othered1: do y ou go after @S at once and how?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow -- that took out the entire site|pg||
nt|djneill: South should have bid over 2@s I think, very nice hand for having passed over 2@d and pd spoke|pg||
nt|poohbear: too likely to lose a dbl partscore swing and 7 imps|pg||
nt|othered1: Nor I.  Getting opponents to the 3-level isn't only a matchpoints strategy. |pg||
nt|poohbear: looks like 2@s and 3@ds are both borderline to make|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzey: ew leads are 1.3.5|pg||
pc|d6|nt|peacokk: Isn't Blaksets 5@D strange?|pg||
nt|peacokk: If partner has @C+@H ...?|pg||
nt|poohbear: One thing that a lot of experts do these days is differentiate between 3 and 4 card raises|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|poohbear: I would bid 2NT to show a limit raise + with 4 trumps|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jbgood: Fredin may get endplayed here to lead up from one of his kings|pg||
nt|xenya: can make it double dummy of course but probably that wouldn't be percentage play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Women are playing the same boards as the Open|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  5 McLeish-Bourke  bid & made 6@H  as did King-Neale|pg||
nt|poohbear: reserve the Q bid for 3 trump raises|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jallerton: he needs a @d trick or a 3rd heart|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|poohbear: Declarer wont misguess @hs knowing that Gill cant have 3@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside down count & attitude|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: EW have been pushed up but still make I think|pg||

pc|s3|nt|frankaus: t/o of @S common treatment here|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jallerton: not both|pg||
nt|dburn: in isolation, you should play those spades for four tricks by leading ace and another, but the entry position does not really lend itself to that|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|fabsayc: this auction not going anywhere fast so 2@C was fine|pg||
pc|dT|nt|santyclz: Declarer can always make this if he guesses correctly, going to be a slow hand.|pg||
nt|mwigor: interestingly reynolds had to play back a @c there double dummy - i cant work out why|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: stay away from GIB!!!|pg||
nt|mwigor: a @h or @c pitch is fine now|pg||
nt|poohbear: as the opps are disconnected in @cs declarer can make this if he reads the positon|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|nt|jbgood: may go wrong now|pg||
nt|santyclz: (I would make this about 1 time out of 5.)|pg||
nt|poohbear: he can endplay West in @hs|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jbgood: but 300 still chea¨p|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, what with both queens being entries, West would have been fine if he had played ace and a spade, but he could not know this|pg||
pc|s7|nt|poohbear: even if he rises King when West ducks he can exit a spade and score the last 3 @h tricks|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kiwibridge: it was a NT other room, xfer to @H then a backin 2@S stole it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6 nice imps to Gosney|pg||
nt|poohbear: Kanetkar shouldnt have kept his @d king!|pg||
pc|sT|nt|djneill: North here can count 5@h, 1@s, 2@c and can take a safe @d hook (surely opening bidder has the @sK vul|pg||

nt|jbgood: with his balancing 3 @c an endplay like in not unthinkable - and S returns to hand with the red suit that W has discarded from..|pg||

nt|jallerton: North's @h did not cost - if he plays a 4th club, declarer ruffs and builds a @d trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: match back to ALL SQUARE --- if it ends this way Konow is in the final tomorrow|pg||
nt|othered1: I've been in worse slams than this one.|pg||
nt|frankaus: EW CC at - http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2010/OpenWom/Lilley-Nagy.pdf|pg||
nt|poohbear: a good result for NS in the other room|pg||
nt|poohbear: not clear to bid 4@h and certainly not clear to make it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: very good, should be down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing South for specifically 3424|pg||
nt|peachy: the impossible. "wrong hand" impossible among other things...|pg||
nt|othered1: a nice little result.  I'd like it better at matchpoints|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphzey: 3nt= good minor preempt ... not a running minorsuit|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 12-14 nt|pg||
nt|jallerton: as the remaining @d were the 4 and the A|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Very true, Jan.|pg||
nt|jallerton: and clubs were 4-4 originally|pg||
nt|djneill: N-S play transfer openings, as if they were responding to an opening 1N almost - 1@c asks, 1@d shows @h, 1@h shows @s, and 1@s is minor suit stayman|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it seems like 4@H can be made|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@d multi. I presume|pg||
nt|poohbear: though might be strong or weak 2 in @h|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which explains the earlier 2h with balanced strong hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: ty Fee|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS 1N=15-"most" 18|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|fabsayc: oops. miscounted|pg||
nt|keylime:  transfer openings and canape it seems too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+   still|pg||
mb|p|nt|peacokk: This is down on a @D lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: Erik, I think 4 NT was always for minors, with another 2-suiter E may double (looks like that is how they play)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=long @D|pg||
nt|mwigor: 1@s is @d or no Major|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|othered1: On simply the @C finesse and no first round ruff|pg||
nt|xenya: is 2@S just spades or a 2-suiter?|pg||
nt|poohbear: whoever said 200 was the kiss of death in MPs  hasnt been -110 very often :)|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: 2@c = majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: just @s|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks|pg||
nt|keylime:  canape for those that do not know, is a method where you bid a 4 card suit, before a five card suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H is much better from north hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: forced by system|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|djneill: North might have been able to double 1@s for takeout (1@d showed @h), but he chose not to, maybe too weak?|pg||
nt|djneill: 2@h was a "cue-bid" likely (getting dizzy)|pg||
nt|frankaus: NS CC at - http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2010/OpenWom/Peake-Richman.pdf|pg||
nt|keylime:  only if S was on a max I would come in to compete in a minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: awkward for South, this - sometimes hard to end up in clubs even when partner bids them, since he might not have them|pg||
nt|poohbear: Or VG operator is Fiona Brown. An Aussie transplanted in England . She is on the English ladies team|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|djneill: West is suspecting the 4-4 @h fit, the singleton @h lead through dummy... getting turned off|pg||
nt|othered1: because of too few major suit cards?|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@c starts invitational auctions|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@d was forced|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: NS plays that north might have only 2clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: Then this hand is a minus for their methods|pg||
nt|dburn: probably, you should play transfers so that South could start with 2NT to show clubs, but...|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 1@c eighter natural or a nt-hånd|pg||
nt|poohbear: so 10 imps to Peake|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzey: but might be a gain because @c K offside|pg||
nt|dburn: ...no harm done here - the methods kept North-South out of a decent slam that was going down, so the methods themselves will not be revised tomorrow|pg||
nt|xenya: EW had a nice save available -- 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the Vanderbilt Final -- with 11 boards remaining the Fleisher [USA] leads Zimmermann [France]  by 14|pg||
nt|poohbear: Gill must have dbled|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: is my guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure why Reynolds would not rebid 1N --- maybe that absolutely denies 3+@D|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@s is very conservative. BUT these guys open very light|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: yes that looked odd|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: even the nice trump holding wont give E 8 tricks here..|pg||
nt|othered1: Do you see any reason for south to continue, unless they may have opened much lighter?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|djneill: shouldn't East have respected West's 2@s? What do you think frank?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or worried about @H??|pg||
nt|poohbear: The reason South didnt open 1@d to prepare this auction is: 1@D shows 5|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|jbgood: and Ace is the texbook lead against a gambling 3 NT - not successful this time|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i bet that's why we have such a small audience|pg||
nt|poohbear: Fiona was so busy reading the press about herself she missed it :P|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think South would pass 3@s as well|pg||
nt|othered1: yes|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|frankaus: please note the Open room score is just 1 table of 5, the scoring id done V a mean datum of the middle 3 tables |pg||
nt|fabsayc: the easiest way to combat these artificial openings is to treat as if natural in the suit shown|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and yes in that case pass of 2@S seems correct|pg||
nt|frankaus: i support with 3 in ths sutuation and we pla @S|pg||
nt|poohbear: 10 of @s away from a decent game at imps|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|frankaus: 2@H prob a cue raise with game interest|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: lol nah i was looking up their system notes - sorry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good shift|pg||
nt|ahollan1: presumably 1@S always says  NOT 4@H/@S|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|peachy: another small pickup for gosney|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes, but I'm told this is butler pairs not teams|pg||
pc|h5|nt|frankaus: 2NT is a further gametry |pg||
nt|othered1: But as the cards lie, they needed a @D shift right there to hold it to 3|pg||
nt|poohbear: I have the NS facts wrong. They do open 1@d with 4.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: down only 1 now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|frankaus: but W was not going on|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|nt|poohbear: this is the defense to beat 4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|poohbear: but perhaps they choose this method of dealing with 4-5|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|xenya: they would have probably bid that had W supported -- |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: but declarer can make double dummy|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|d8|pc|sT|pg||
nt|poohbear: making 4 now|pg||
nt|othered1: I have to open south 1@C (and rebid @C over 1@S) since 1@D-2@C rebid is specialized.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: probably better chance at overtrick by playing 3 rounds of diamonds ending in DUMMY  then declarer knows if @D is good or not and might have distribution info to decide about @s ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i guess ok in 3 but position was pretty clear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i just got whiplash|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: just using othertable for comparisons on BBO|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it will be a guide for us anyway|pg||
nt|poohbear: I solve these hands by opening 1@d but thats a personal choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: none of the players will be caught and fined for violating the speedlimit|pg||
nt|dburn: particularly if 1@c does not show clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I think EW plays 1@c as at least a 3-card @c :)|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@c, however, does show clubs|pg||
nt|poohbear: and rebidding @cs|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|jallerton: 2@d Multi includes 3-7HCP weak 2s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 2nt as S|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d = weak major -- 3-7 hcp ... with 8-11 they open 2 in the majorsuit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Robinson didn't have a Weak 2@D mechanism|pg||
nt|poohbear: Im told this is pair based so the team scores arent real|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=ART, 9-14, 4+@H, maybe longer @C/@D, NEG DBL => 4@S|pg||
nt|othered1: That's old-fashioned standard and still right if your @D-@C auctions are natural.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Defense needed to find the @d shift after the first or second round of @hs to beat game|pg||
mb|3C|nt|djneill: that @dA cash seems a little dangerous - what if East has the @dJ and @c are 4-4 then 2NT makes while cashing the clubs then a @h through always sets it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=ART, F, 11+ HCP|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzey: 2@d = 5+@h|pg||
nt|jbgood: N wants to jumpaccept|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@c= majors|pg||

nt|frankaus: is this the worst 17 ever?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: :) ... but it is not often speedlimit is that low :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: guess 2 NT meant something to that effect|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: we are playing with screens -- and the alerts I make is the alerts and explanations I make is made by W and S|pg||
nt|peacokk: They may play new suit as weak doubleton and 3@H as a minimum 4-card raise?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: is it easy to overtake here?|pg||
nt|poohbear: given these boys opening bid style I find the 3@c bid too aggressive|pg||
pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: indeed, seems can never be right|pg||
nt|poohbear: he has chances for a minor suit slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know the relay structure :(|pg||
nt|mwigor: looks like natural|pg||
nt|othered1: agree, with only 3 trumps. |pg||
nt|poohbear: Gill might well have countered with his hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: game is no bargain tho|pg||
nt|poohbear: and Gos would not have accepted|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzey: the lead of @s 9 is eighter from 9x or 9xx|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: or perhaps 9 |pg||
nt|djneill: KQ tight is a bad holding, berry bad|pg||
nt|keylime:  I'm sure when dummy comes down Nagy will be happy to be playing in a low partial|pg||
nt|poohbear: Partner has not denied 4@ds yet|pg||
pc|s2|nt|poohbear: and has to be mildly worried that a @h lead might set 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: odds shift substantially if partner can have only 11 points, then 4 not safe|pg||
nt|poohbear: this is a coffee break hand now|pg||
nt|peachy: whoa!|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can't be from 9xx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is that allowed?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzey: S explains 2nt as too good for 3@h |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: yes according to cc it can|pg||
nt|othered1: It doesn't seem that west should be essaying state-of-the-match tactics at this point.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lesson here may be  4-small does not a help-suit game try make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and from the sensible side also|pg||
pc|h7|nt|dburn: 12 IMPs to Blakset on 7, where North chose to lead a club against 3NT - conveniently in dummy at trick one, declarer played a spade towards the queen at trick 2 and never knew he ...|pg||
nt|dburn: had a problem|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk4: sorry, this is against NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just looking at EW hands -- i'd be very happy to stop in 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looking at all 4 hands -- i'd be happy to stop in 3N|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: no problem Roland :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: with @s 6-2, I'm wondering if declarer might take an unusual line in hearts - lead 10 from hand|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: richman should either have returned a club or a heart, spades going no where|pg||
nt|djneill: South had a tough holding to lead from - all suits look bad to lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: and that should do it|pg||
pc|h6|nt|santyclz: Don't know about other countries, but in the usa there are highways with a minimum speed of 40 mph.|pg||
nt|jallerton: to pin 9x or 8x in East|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jallerton: playing for @CJ and/or @c10 in West|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW have plenty of time to take their @D trick to go with trump Ace and 2@C|pg||
nt|poohbear: now they play 9 x 16 boards RR|pg||
pc|h9|nt|poohbear: but will carryover from each match they previously played|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 2@C was natural -- remember Peake could have had 4@H & 5+@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pause for questions or is Appleton trying to convince himself to lead his singleton?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: can Peake do anything other than win @S then @D from top?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|hK|nt|poohbear: so effectively 26 board matches|pg||
nt|poohbear: top 3 pairs become Australian team - 2 target events, the PABF (Zone 6) in Hamilton NZ and the Commonwealth Nations Cup in Delhi (just after Philadelphia)|pg||
nt|poohbear: the top 3 can choose whether to play 1 or both events|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D from top or start with Jack or 10?  [to delay finding discards]|pg||
nt|poohbear: this line is banking on the @d onside|pg||
nt|poohbear: perhaps better to try for a @c ruff in dummy?|pg||
nt|poohbear: but declarer was worried about potential @s ruff|pg||
nt|othered1: That would have been my choice|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c2|nt|vugraphzey: but even though I think its slow we are now halfway through this segment ... and they have only used half the time ... so thats ok :)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||

nt|ahollan1: from top only works if @DQ doubleton|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: ummmm now incredibly lucky Appleton doesn't have 2nd @S|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: curious that both tables had unimpeded auctions to game -- one from EW one from NS|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not so curious -- neither makes|pg||
nt|peachy: switch East's kings, so not unreasonable to try 3NT. However, I would wait for it to be vul|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: NOW @D from top to hopefully keep South off the lead?    nope wrong again Al|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|ralfwil: S will y´take his 9 tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: maybe Peake has longer neck|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
nt|peacokk: Team Blakset beat 4@H on  4 for 12 IMPs|pg||
nt|poohbear: Paul Gosney is missing the White House Jrs in Amsterdam to play this event in Sydney|pg||
nt|poohbear: Must be important to pass up a trip to Amsterdam !|pg||
nt|poohbear: We might ask our VG operator why she isnt in Amsterdam!|pg||
nt|bjurn:  Especially for WHJr, it's a really nice tournament|pg||
mc|9|nt|jbgood: yes, the trump lead turned out better for defense than the club lead at our table|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: a little break here -- toilet I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: players are back --- ready to go again|pg||

nt|dburn: you might as well play it as opposed to the six - who knows what might happen?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not to mention all the voluntary minus results when partner is weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if there is a @D lead that could stop West from cashing @DA before playing the 1st @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|peacokk: Nice sacrifice in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: two boards left .. Konow need 25 imp ... tough|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: don't worry about running score anyway  this trials is PAIR event -- just setup on BBO to have some other result to look at|pg||
nt|mwigor: assuming they're dropping top and bottom datum on 14 will be 650 so thats 8 IMPs to peake-richman|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=STR with @D|pg||
mb|1C|nt|fabsayc: wow, what a method|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: where are all the aussie commentators asks the poor Kiwi?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|vugraphzey: 2@h is weak @h support from South .... 2@d would have been a good @h support|pg||
nt|jallerton: East has a decision to make now.  3@C?  3@S?  Force to game with 3@h?|pg||
nt|mwigor: the transfer jump shift or the selection method?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: both :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  now 3@d as a game try by N?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d is a kind of "reversed Drury" ... 2@d shows that W has an opening hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: N awaits a high ! contract ..|pg||
nt|jbgood: @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@c is a kind of "reversed Drury" ... 2@d shows that W has an opening hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Robinson 1@C=4+|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: first time i've seen [or heard] of this treatment|pg||
nt|mwigor: the abf seems to feel it needs to come up with a new method each year - so they come up with some unusual ones|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: is this the final countdown|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: lead is @c J|pg||
mb|2N|nt|xenya: another chance lost -- 3N by W would have probably made|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 3 @h is by most players just a fight - strange action by N|pg||
nt|jallerton: With West haveing a light opening bid (Fredin passed in the other room) the low road works well|pg||
nt|fabsayc: australian bridge players invent new conventions every hour, hard to keep up :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks Ally on the vugraph and thx specs for your feedback|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx to the ABF and BBO for putting this on|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|othered1: Wrong-sided as the cards lie.  But somehow 2N with that @H holding deserves some punishment, if not the obvious one.|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: It's actually in even years that the ABF runs a Pair based selection.  In odd years (Bermuda Bowl) there is a Team based selection|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least half of those Australians are ex-pat Kiwi's :)|pg||
nt|mwigor: this is true - but the format of each changes regularly|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: their 2N opener is @C & @D -- i wonder how they handle the various 20+ balanced hands|pg||
nt|poohbear: Highly aggressive by West|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzey: seems like we have to congratulate Lars Blakset - Jakob Røn, Håkan Nilsson - Peter Fredin and Mathias Bruun - Knut Blakset with a place in the final|pg||
nt|xenya: however a few spectators point out it can still be made on a squeeze|pg||
nt|poohbear: I look at 10xxx in trumps and pass faaaaaaaaasr|pg||
nt|poohbear: faaaaaaast|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|babs59: I quite like this year's version - with the carryover from Stage 1 - those 10 boards count in this match, effectively making each set a 26 board match|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jbgood: 3 NT also popular in the OR |pg||
pc|d8|pc|h4|nt|henryb:  at the other table E-W went faster and gave N-S no chance to stop in a partial|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well this one they played from right side of table, it certainly can gain although opportunities for such a bid must be limited|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|babs59: It means that those earlier matches against eliminated pairs (whether big wins or losses) no longer count|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzey: sooo .. The Fat Lady is here again .. or?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: New Zealand was a Pair event too -- and only 8 pairs in Open [vs 2 teams - 5 pairs - in last year's Team format]|pg||
pc|sK|nt|peacokk: 4 IMPs to Blakset|pg||
nt|jbgood: quite aq few use double after 3@c as a game invite|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jbgood: that would have worked |pg||
pc|dT|pc|d9|pc|h5|pc|d7|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: indeed, if tou run diamonds, S has no answer|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|poohbear: nice lie of the cards|pg||
pc|hT|nt|xenya: assuming you read the position well of course|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: this was a rather delicate stop|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|jallerton: spec suggests North could have played a @s for an uppercut.  Dec can then discard from hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: much easier when North shows out|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
mc|10|nt|poohbear: last hand of the set|pg||

nt|jallerton: This is the last board of the set. Thank-you to Jan Nielsen, our excellent vu-graph operator.|pg||
nt|jallerton: Thanks also to my co-commentator, Ralf Willquist|pg||
nt|jallerton: Thanks also to the DBF (Jacob Duschek and Matias Rohrberg) for arranging the broadcast, |pg||
nt|jallerton: ..finally thanks to BBO and Roland Wald for making this broadcast possible.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Thank Jan for your nice work and Jeffrey for nice cooperation:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: We are a little behind schedule --- we are ready to start the last segment in about one hour and 5 minutes.|pg||
nt|jallerton: 6@s has a lot of work to do on this deal - went off in the other room even with @sQx onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: last board of the match .. The Fat Lady is on stage .. ready to sing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fortuitous @S layout considering the bad @C break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and now the last -- if we can just avoid another crash ....|pg||
nt|mrnye: at the other table south doubled 3H for the lead which leads to 9 tricks only because the heart can't get discarded in time on the clubs|pg||
nt|djneill: doubling an artificial bid for the lead when partner is going to be on lead is a great idea I think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: over the double should bid only 3, on this auction i think 4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the bidding in open room was psychodelic|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on 31|pg||
nt|mwigor: yes - but the balance is also thrown out by that|pg||
nt|mwigor: some pairs will have had stronger or weaker teammates|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|poohbear: comic NT|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzey: 3nt = good 4major opening ... suit is unknown|pg||
nt|Walddk11: Many thanks to Jan Nielsen, great operating all day!|pg||
nt|Walddk11: and to Vladimir, Ed and David for commentary|pg||
nt|othered1: And thank you, Roland, for keeping so many balls in the air this weekend.|pg||
nt|poohbear: either strong or a weak preempt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=9-14, 4+@H, maybe longer @C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=TRF @H, 10-13, 3@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: last board here and it's Catherine on the vugraph we have to thank today @H|pg||
nt|poohbear: excellent 6NT here|pg||
nt|poohbear: need to figure out the @ds and the @ss to bid it though|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk11: Draining but it's fun|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 4@h = pass if @h is your suit or correct to 4@s if thats your suit|pg||
mb|2N|nt|henryb:  I think it is better to use the intermediate step as the (artificial) game try, and double as a suggestion of penalty|pg||
nt|peacokk: Isn't it as playing with a junior - every game-try is a way to game|pg||
nt|kareno: We played comic NT in Paris in the sixties.  Don't often see it now.|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: very popular in Australia|pg||
nt|poohbear: as we can see. EW were prepared|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if 1NT not alerted 2@C would either be non-forcing or majors for most north americans|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Peter deep in thought|pg||
nt|poohbear: What itme is the next session Fee?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 2:30|pg||
nt|kareno: Problem is south doesn't know north's suit and can't push them around with it.|pg||
nt|poohbear: so next session is in a little over an hour from now|pg||
nt|kareno: And how long until 2:30?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: sigh, why not bid naturally|pg||
nt|othered1: West hand can be tough to rebid if you show a solid suit when you jump over a 2/1.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: Do you have time for dinner, Jan?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2NT relay|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: If you know my weight you wouldnt be asking ... I look like one who ALWAYS have time for dinner :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: and today is no exception .... I promise :)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|poohbear: I guess 2NT showed significant extras but he does have a good 6 card suit and 18 prime points|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: 3@h is transfer|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@s shows 3-card @s .. with only two North would bid 3nt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now he has eliminated all blackwood bids|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@c seems very dangerous|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  that is a brave balance|pg||
nt|jbgood: Difficult for Konow to win this board - but may get a push|pg||
nt|mrnye: I dont like the 1nt bid by andrew here|pg||
nt|mrnye: opposite a favourable 1S overcall you are just asking for trouble|pg||
nt|mrnye: richman could be overcalling many 6-7 counts here|pg||
nt|poohbear: not sure what Gill means by it|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@h was bizarre.  Was it meant as a transfer? cuebid?  Why not bid his second suit?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all pass is possible|pg||
nt|poohbear: I can ask his sister . She is in the audience and an Australian internationalist .|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: was 1nt perhaps alerted as hearts, else this is insane|pg||
nt|othered1: This is also an example of a good hand for a big club system.|pg||
nt|poohbear: aaaaah ok|pg||
nt|poohbear: this makes more sense|pg||
nt|poohbear: but still . I feel West hasnt done Justice to this hand|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jallerton: Well you have worked hard for it today.  Enjoy!|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 5@h = 2 aces an no @sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk11: Pharmaservice by 4 IMPs with 4 comparisons to come in the other semi-final|pg||
nt|Walddk11: Two very tight semi-finals|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Tomorrow we start at 9am -- looking forward to seeing you all then :) |pg||
nt|Walddk11: And the bridge has been very good most of the time|pg||
nt|othered1: With lots of exciting hands and, accordingly, chances to misjudge things.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Sghe says this is why she has played with Peter once in the last 30 years :) ( OK just me kidding :))|pg||
nt|ahollan1: friendly lie for declarer|pg||
nt|othered1: He never let partner evaluate his @SQ in terms of tricks to take|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|mrnye: 1nt should show 11-13 or so in this sort of auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  TRF = Transfer|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jallerton: a play problem to end with then|pg||
nt|poohbear: Perhaps a 4@s bid ( having bid 2NT) would better serve his purpose. That has to be a 6 card suit and 18-19 otherwise why the 2NT bid?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jallerton: still.  South has to lead something|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: if this wins the match is all square|pg||
nt|poohbear: now slam in @cs|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jbgood: the step - balance sure is breave:) |pg||
nt|poohbear: the hard way|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|jallerton: that lead helps declarer more than the @h selected in the other room|pg||
nt|poohbear: ok this is a wrap for now folks|pg||
nt|poohbear: back in an hour|pg||
nt|poohbear: Thanks Fiona . Great job operating|pg||
nt|poohbear: one point of play|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: nice defense!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes and thanks to all the usual suspects|pg||
nt|poohbear: @ss can only be picked up in one direction|pg||
nt|poohbear: so ace first is the right play|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jallerton: he can now count 12 tricks if @s are 2-2, but can he make it on 3-1 spades?|pg||
nt|Walddk11: Thanks all, see you tomorrow|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk11: Bye for now|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: bye|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: and sleep welle|pg||
nt|othered1: Thaks all and bye!|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not any more however|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jbgood: and the balance was not found at the other table|pg||
nt|djneill: the @h situation is probably marked here - East showed 4, and West let the @hK, unlikely West would lead from a doubleton King knowing the opponents had 7 of them, unless it was KQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not that clear from lead, but is strange defense if nagy has the queen|pg||
nt|keylime:  I duck because I really have no compelling reason to cover here|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|jbgood: bye all - see you in an hour or so for the next 16|pg||
pc|sK|nt|poohbear: cant pick up 4-0 in south|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzey: if the match ends "all square" after the last 16 boards tonight, then Konow will earn a place in tomorrows final |pg||
nt|jallerton: might try @c finesse now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jbgood: 9 imps with 2 sessions to go|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: still need to play 32 boards in this semifinal ... see you all later|pg||
nt|jbgood: bye all|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|poohbear: we restart in about 15 min theoretically but depends on the other table|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kiwibridge: thx Catherine and everyone|pg||
pc|c6|nt|othered1: Right.  In a tight partnership, you'll have discussed this stuff, perhaps this hand specifically|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mrnye: east may find the play with QTxx though since he knows south has two good diamonds and that the heart is his only possible entry|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h9|nt|peacokk: Not the best line |pg||
nt|jallerton: now needs @s 2-2 or possibly @SQ singleton|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzey: see you all in one hour|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mrnye: would be a great defence from nagy - i wouldn't put it passed him|pg||
nt|poohbear: Thanks Catherine for a job well done|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h8|nt|vugrapha4: Gold asking what 3H meant - 'natural' |pg||
nt|poohbear: back in an hour|pg||
nt|poohbear: thanks everyone|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
mc|12|nt|poohbear: our VG operator Catherine Ritter|pg||
nt|poohbear: thanks all for coming|pg||
nt|othered1: How do you play 11S - 2@H - 3N?  I play it this hand.|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2 more sets today|pg||
nt|poohbear: certainly playable|pg||
nt|othered1: Similar to more standard usage of 1m -1M - 3N|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks everyone and bye|pg||
