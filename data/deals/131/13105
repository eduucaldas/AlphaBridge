nt|sunsamvar: Hi Roland and Vladimir|pg||
nt|panja: Usually, the third seat preempt is 'wide range' and is expected to bother opps..but here, it likely helped them|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: walid: what was your shape?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: seemed better to pitch a club on the third heart, then play a spade|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dinos1: better to play @s to J and set 5th @d|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thxto Wayne:) Here u are the score after segment 2: http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2010/01/vanderbilt/|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N!|an|either bal or short !H|mb|p|nt|gambit: Huge lead for Strul, hopefully this match will become a little closer, adds to the flavour |pg||
mb|3H|an|NAT 5+|nt|dinos1: 100% line coz def didnt lead @c to that moment|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: this is a fair slam, but again the play is not straightforward|pg||
nt|dburn: and nor is the bidding - not quite sure what Passell intends here|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|dburn: no doubt 4@d is Blackwood for clubs, but...|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@d was? @crkcb?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: I will forward any explanations I can read or overhear|pg||
nt|dburn: ...that seems a little odd with no control in either of the unbid suits|pg||
nt|chick: I'm told by a spec that it is a transfer to hearts, not sure if that is true or not :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: NS play 1@C could be 2 if 4432, so 1@D is always real diamonds|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dburn: well, North will be confident at this point|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: twas passell thinking there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness quits fidgeting with his pencil and leans over the table to examine dummy|pg||
nt|gambit: the lead looks terrifying from W perspective|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: whether confident enough to double, we will discover|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: el ahmady in a hurry to push the tray after !4C; helness slows him down and alerts.  writing explanations on both sides of screen|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|dinos1: 1@c was strong so ...|pg||
nt|stewball: attack|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  Becker's too wise to double.  if they ran, his partner would have to guess what suit to lead against 7@C|pg||
nt|stewball: very curious|pg||
nt|dburn: he cannot be sure of beating 7@c, so he will probably let it go|pg||
nt|dinos1: if dbl 6N then 7@c by E and what to lead? :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|d6|nt|panja: 2Nt is BAL or short H....if BAL, Helgemo has reason to think @H contract will be better..|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|panja: not the best lead..trump would have restricted to 4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 4@C = cue bid; 4@S = short @H|pg||

nt|fabsayc: there is no night and day in Vegas|pg||
nt|hlortz: or reno|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: casinos open continuously|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree Bill. They could perhaps have started earlier than 1 pm (13.00)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But there is probably a logical explanation|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: which causes a huge rush and long waits|pg||

mb|1S|nt|dinos1: not a good start for EW in this segment|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 1@D not alerted by Passell but Strul shows two fingers and Passell nods|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bergen raise|pg||

nt|lml: hey Harmon |pg||
nt|gambit: what a balance!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: immediate 3@S, apparently had decided to balance over 3@H while Sadek had the tray|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 6@D makes because of the lucky lie of the red suits|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|dinos1: 2@d - GF checkback|pg||
nt|xenya: on 49, the bidding in OR was entirely different -- S opened 1@C (not 3@C as here) and it was W who preempted with 3@S -- no wonder EW stayed out of game |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: this is not the worst 6@d in the world, and it will make on this lie of cards, but bidding it will be quite a feat|pg||
nt|dinos1: one more minor slam|pg||
nt|dinos1: now 2N - 3@d?|pg||
nt|dburn: especially since up to now, diamonds have not actually been bid at all|pg||
nt|dburn: if East bids 3@d now, they have some sort of chance, but...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: lynch folds her hand, crosses her arms, looks at her cards again|pg||
nt|gambit: double |pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: helness can sniff helgemo's stiff @H on the bidding|pg||
nt|panja: 4@s a nice spot..|pg||
nt|panja: once again trump lead will be the best for defence|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dburn: ...well, she bid it|pg||
nt|panja: Decl will likely take the A, discards, and xruf|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dinos1: well - W has good hand for pd|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Vugraphzfe: kibitzer asks Passell for permission to sit behind him - normally no one bothers to ask|pg||
nt|dinos1: side aces and KJ in trump suit|pg||
nt|stewball: and a legit @d suit|pg||
nt|dburn: not clear what 3@h is - 4@d would have been clearer to East, but Passell may intend to support diamonds at a later stage|pg||
nt|dinos1: @sJ wd be golden )|pg||
nt|stewball: i think 3@h is a punt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: carolyn still working it out|pg||
nt|dburn: Lynch not clear what it is either - if I were West it would show worry about clubs for 3NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: strul examining EW system card|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3@s now, no?|pg||
nt|dburn: but in any case East seems to have a 3@s bid and let the chips fall|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. Would have payed|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|dinos1: now 4@c|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: yes, seems to cover all possibilities|pg||
nt|harmon: back to a ht and 4th d|pg||
nt|harmon: oops|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness leans over the table for a closer look at @CK|pg||
nt|gambit: I would too...........|pg||
nt|rodal f: If u take those two payers I put my money at Helness. A teambuilder and a sniffing nose better then the most of us.|pg||
nt|lml: it is an awlward card though|pg||
nt|gambit: Fabulous players, with the nose(s) of a bloodhound|pg||
nt|lml: this is a link for the half time scores http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2010/01/vanderbilt/|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: walid looking around, slightly impatient.  Sadek sitting back in his chair looking calm|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: and helgemo is always stoic|pg||
nt|rodal f: We don't use that type of dogs to much in Norway Cam:)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|dburn: no doubt Passell intends that as keycard for diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: but I confess that if I were East, the whole thing would be a complete mystery to me|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Vugraphzfe: strul writing a question then puts his pen on top so I can't read|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if East can work it out the final contract will be 6@d, but if she can't, there is the horrid possibility that it might be 4@h|pg||
nt|dinos1: I was await 4@c cue, but 4@h - it's above me|pg||
nt|chick: have to admit, I'd figure W for a lot of hearts right about now|pg||
nt|dinos1: mb it's @d rkcb? :)|pg||
nt|dburn: I ma sure that it is, but East is not sure at all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: the alerted 4@D previously and alerted 4@H here suggest EW are playing kickback over minors|pg||
nt|dinos1: but why E is thinking so long?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: but now that you mention it, I didn't see lynch alert 4@H when the tray came through|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: NS both holding their cards below the table and looking down|pg||
nt|chick: I wonder if they are using the old rule that says cards have to be played on the same day they are dealt?  :)|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a tough position for Carolyn Lynch - the spectators all know what West's bidding means, and so do North, South, West and I|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: kibitzer H. Lall seems to have fallen asleep|pg||
nt|chick: does this count for sominex coup?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sorry I can't get any read from carolyn, behind her shoulder so I can't see her face.  she's sitting very still this whole time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: strul gestures like he can't believe what's going on|pg||
nt|dburn: she may be wondering why, if partner did not bid Blackwood over 3@d,he can bid it over 3@s|pg||
nt|dinos1: better was cue 4@c and let E ask with 4@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: passell: carolyn, you've got to do something.  this is just ridiculous|pg||

nt|bjacobs: East is not going to cash his @CQ|pg||
nt|hlortz: for the defense no?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes ... and no|pg||
nt|fabsayc: casen's win of second heart should mean he has spots to run suit|pg||
nt|hlortz: lol maybe not but if declarers @H werent vulnerasble he'd just have conceded a @C imho|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so i agree with henry|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, he didn't get close.  You want him to rise @DK, cash @CQ and play a heart ... he didn't even achieve the first step|pg||
nt|hlortz: thx martin it's a rare thing for someone to agree w/ me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i will try to do it again|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The point is that East cannot possibly be sure what the situation is ... this is why he perhaps incorrectly ducked the diamond|pg||
nt|hlortz: well it was very easy for ME from up here :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: very slow here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can be sure|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes the duck was the 'natural' play i agree|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: table slightly behind on time|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He truly cannot be sure.  South COULD have @HQ1096.  It's not certain how West would defend with AJ832|pg||
nt|fabsayc: then casen ducks second heart|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No, no, real life isn't like that|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Casen is not certain whether East has 2 hearts or 3|pg||
nt|hlortz: ok but still imho w would/should duck the @H but i see your point|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You are falling into the trap of double-dummy defending|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Casen told Michael to take his time|pg||
nt|fabsayc: how am i suppose to single dummy, close one eye?|pg||
nt|hlortz: perhaps but IF pard has only 2@H may be impossible to beat... but i agree can be mislead by seeing the cards that west/east cannot|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You said: "he can be sure".  Sorry, but that's inaccurate.  I fall into the same trap myself all the time, know it well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No Martin, but I am sure you know the option of seeing just one hand|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: sadek rolls his neck, then leans forward - about as much body language as you'll see from him|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: walid fanning his cards on the table|pg||
nt|gambit: after the 4C bid, best to lie low |pg||
nt|gambit: 4@H/4@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive Harmon agree with u Cam.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness yawns again.  I wonder if these players suffer from jet lag, 9+ hours behind their home time zone|pg||
nt|lml: I think a heart lead will prevent 6NT|pg||
nt|gambit: of course South might have cause to imagine his partner's diamonds to be MUCH better|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Vugraphzfe: walid stops examining his hand and leans forward to examine dummy more closely|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dinos1: now @c - then =|pg||
nt|lml: but that will be the normal lead|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dinos1: this is +2|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lml: yes you are all right.  Anything but a heart it can be made on a double squeeze|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: starting with round of 16 the vanderbilt is played with screens which run diagonally across the table so players cannot see their partners mannerisms|pg||
nt|gambit: tempting to try, thaat 4D bid was sedductive, let's see if he can resist|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: during the auction the boards are passed back and forth through a curtain.  after the auction a window is opened so all players can see one another's played cards and the dummy|pg||
nt|harmon: not i cant as lomg as E retains Jxx of hts|pg||
nt|dinos1: wonder - at all 4 tables 4@h+3 was played (b.38)|pg||
nt|gambit: Imagine Akxxxx xx Akx xx |pg||
nt|lml: I think that South should discount the @CQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sadek still contemplating his next call|pg||
nt|rodal f: Just for fun. If N had 3@H and single @C by a 6NTS|pg||
nt|gambit: and the 4@D call, that was inflammatory |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness clears his throat for the hundredth time and riffles his cards.  seems impatient|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helgemo looks like he could sit in that posture forever|pg||
nt|rodal f: There way to be John:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: one arm across his chest, other elbow on his wrist, scratching his chin|pg||
nt|lml: the way you have to make it in 6NT assuming no heart lead is actually a kind of strip squeeze|pg||
nt|lml: you have to play a diamond from dummy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Helgemo by the pokerface and Helness the former world champ at poker|pg||
nt|lml: East has to duck|pg||
nt|lml: then you run all your winners and West has to hold three clubs (and therefore two hearts)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lml: you cash the hearts and throw him in|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lml: so that is our fairy tale for today|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: the time "limit" is 150 minutes for 16 boards|pg||
nt|harmon: cant east keep Jxx of hts??|pg||
nt|gambit: If Helgemo doubled  - would that say don't lead my suit?|pg||
nt|lml: no because then you dont cash the hearts|pg||
nt|lml: you play club club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: but enforcement is difficult because often both sides are at fault|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pg||
nt|lml: its a five card ending|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: moss-gitelman/fleisher-kamil fell far behind on time in Q1 then rushed to catch up|pg||

nt|lml: now how to get to hearts|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lml: yes multi is so fearsome|pg||
nt|lml: we North Americans quake before it|pg||
mb|d|nt|gambit: tough to believe such a long-standing convention is so dispised by the authorities |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: ladies and gentlemen, this is lightning bridge here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gambit: Even though E is clearly a notch or 2 (or 3) down from these players, I think we also have to recognize the pressure, to perform at this level and their successes so far, it is ...|pg||
nt|gambit: easier to criticize that to priase |pg||
nt|dinos1: Lynch team won 25 and 27 boards - 22 imps|pg||

nt|gambit: will he bid 2@H? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: only the second time I recall that he's needed extra time|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: connection fine again now|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: entry problems in south and west hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness pointed at 1NT card.  Walid showed him the fist that means strong.  Helness, laughing: "we'll see!"|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: helness: after pass, I am not sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helgemo: well, we will see|pg||
nt|lml: many strange things in the ACBL convention restrictions|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sadek had asked for an explanation and helgemo had to ask|pg||
