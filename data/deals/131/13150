mb|p|nt|lc: Third straight quarter with these 2 pairs opposing each other.  It looks as if both pairs plan on not sitting out today.|pg||

nt|kareno: Who would ever bench either pair?|pg||
nt|lc: Bidding a slam (like maybe 6@C) would be a stretch here for E-W.  Quite normal to play 3NT.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|lc: In most people's opinions, these 2 pairs are in the world's top-10.  But normal is to rest one quarter.|pg||

nt|chick: N is trying to decide which of him many suits to signal for |pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||

nt|daman: they will prevail   I would have lost IMPs|pg||

nt|pef: a bit more room for something interesting to happen on this board|pg||
mb|2D|nt|gambit: Maybe that was the problem  - Nickell is famous for their second jhalf (or late innings if you prefer) rallies |pg||
nt|kareno: Nickell|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|lc: Helgemo could have bid 2@H to show a big hear hand, but I think the second X is a better description.|pg||
nt|pef: what now, Larry?  3D?|pg||
nt|dburn: not impossible for Helgemo to let this go|pg||
nt|gambit: 3@S|pg||
nt|lc: Not clear.  @DQ looks useless.|pg||
nt|gambit: I will call jeff, neat MSC problem, format D....|pg||
nt|barnets: i think hell bid|pg||
nt|lc: If pard has   @Sxxxx  @Hxxx  @Dxxx  @Cxxx  (almost like his hand on Board 33), you can see that passing would be best.|pg||
nt|paulhac:  More likely to bid as he is vulnerable|pg||
nt|kareno: My goodness, south has a hand too good to overcall :)|pg||
nt|lc: One more peep, and I think Helness will bid 4@S -- since he could have had that 4-3-3-3 0-count but has more.|pg||
nt|pef: does anyone think north should have bid 3s over the second double?|pg||
nt|kareno: Not yet I don't.|pg||
nt|dburn: the problem with doubling with all these weak no trump hands is that you are a bit stranded when you have a lot more|pg||
nt|lc: With some shape, I would have bid 3@S the first time!  (To show 6 spades and a weak hand -- the way many play it).|pg||
nt|kareno: Interesting, Larry.|pg||
nt|gambit: does S create an issue for N if he takes a while and bids again? willwe see the director called?|pg||
nt|barnets: no|pg||
nt|pef: of course, 4s could easily go down on this hand with diamond diamond diamond play|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Not often one catches geir thinking so long|pg||
mb|3S|nt|dburn: still, these days you have to double with the 4-3-3-3 opening bids, otherwise they will rob you blind|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: 3 should get him 4.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Now I think north should reconsider and bid the game.|pg||
nt|lc: Hmmm.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lc: Well, 4 is down -- right?|pg||
nt|barnets: yes it is|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pef: boy that's really surprising that north passed, but as we said, the limit seems to be 3s|pg||
nt|lc: @D @D @D sets up an extra trump trick.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|barnets: so good pass by north|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|kareno: Or, you might say, successful pass by north.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|nt|barnets: ok|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Even so I am slightly surprised|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lc: Game is quite good -- and a VUL game doesn't even need to be this good.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dburn: maybe Geir was thinking about 3@h, to cater for the dreaded 4=3=3=3 Yarborough in North|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|d8|pg||
nt|lc: It fails only because @S are 3-1 AND the 1 is with the short diamonds.  (Assuming @SK on).|pg||
nt|kareno: That's why I call it a successful pass.  |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|paulhac:  Perhaps we can put it down to table presence|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
nt|barnets: south did open 3@C in previous deal|pg||
nt|barnets: in closed|pg||
nt|barnets: but same contract|pg||
nt|gambit: or a total lack of values beyond the 5th/6th spade|pg||
nt|lc: Can he thinking about laying down the @SA?   |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|dburn: well, that queen of clubs is not a "total lack of values"|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gambit: E need K@s to come close to an opener|pg||
nt|pef: why would he ever do that?  the K of spades is overwhelmingly likely to be in the east hand|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|lc: Well, he must have considered it.|pg||

nt|dinos1: I knew pair who used 5-4-3-2-1 honor count|pg||

nt|ritong: south might cue twice|pg||

mb|p|nt|gambit: does S raise 2@s to 3? I think so |pg||
nt|hlortz: yes that 9@S in west is a big card |pg||
nt|ritong: and with a six bagger, north should cooperate|pg||
nt|ritong: til now, he has promised three @ss, and he has six|pg||
nt|gambit: and a dearth of values beyond spade 5/6 |pg||

nt|pef: if left to play here, helness now rates to guess spades and clubs correctly|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: East would always bid 5@d on this auction I believe.|pg||
nt|kareno: Spade queen is not an asset.|pg||
nt|barnets: and5@S has no chance|pg||
nt|pef: true, but a 3-1 spade break very likely|pg||
nt|lc: This tests N-S Forcing-Pass agreements.  This sounds like one -- but it is hard to ever be sure.|pg||
nt|pef: hard to believe helness is seriously considering 5s opposite a partner who could only bid 2 the first time|pg||
nt|kareno: If north had made some lower-level forcing bid, then I guess pass would be forcing.|pg||
mb|5S|nt|lc: After 20 years with David, we still couldn't cover every possible auction. Our default rule (it helps to have one) is : "Unless we have defined it as forcing, then it isn't."|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: guess he was seriously considering it :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Many experts have understandings (I don't) about forcing passes when at adverse vulnerability.|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure that when North is a passed hand, any five-level pass is forcing in an auction of this kind|pg||
nt|lc: So, South's Pass would NOT have been forcing.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kareno: Not in my style, Larry.  I don't know about this pair.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lc: So, he can guess @S and guess @C, but all for -100.|pg||
nt|dburn: but for this North-South 1@c showed (gasp) clubs, so that North had good reason to bid on|pg||
nt|pef: first blood drawn in the quarter, an overtrick on board 35|pg||
nt|kareno: If anyone wants to look at Helgemo/Helness CC http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2007BermudaBowlShanghai/bermuda-bowl/Norway/helgemo-helness.pdf|pg||

nt|dinos1: why K and fin and not A and fin? N is more dangerous hand|pg||

mb|d!|nt|paulhac:  Hi John how are you?|pg||
nt|kareno: It's because I type so fast, not that you think slowly :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|lc: And East suspects what the suit is -- |pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|lc: Bids 2@C to find out.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: And now will pass.  Disciplined. |pg||
mb|p|pc|c8|nt|lc: Inexperienced players would run (with their void) and usually make matters worse.|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s seem to have 6 fast tricks|pg||
nt|kareno: I play a convention with my favorite partner that fits here.  If we are going to have a disaster, each of us TRIES to get the other to be declarer :)|pg||

nt|dburn: fine line between "disciplined" and "resigned", but what can he do?|pg||
nt|kareno: Even to think of bidding again with east's hand is madness.|pg||
nt|pef: yes, especially at this vulnerability at imps, he knows partner has good diamonds|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lc: To show a vulnerable 1-suiter here promises at least a 6-card suit, and usually not a bad one.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, maybe he could have bid 2@d, pass or correct - his actual choice gave the opponents two shots at doubling|pg||
nt|kareno: Note the Ace, King of clubs.  Playing the Ace first was suit preference for spades.|pg||
nt|barnets: fleisher let 2@S go with the 22 count and they mad exactly 2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|kareno: And Helness helps by pressing the spade Jack, not a small one.|pg||

nt|barnets: kamil fleisher judged better than helness in x 5@D|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|pef: that despite, fleisher opening 1s instead of 1c as david suggested|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: zimmermann points to 3 clubs and says 3 card suit|pg||

pc|d2|pc|h6|nt|henryb:  I think Fleisher will just concede a spade and take his seven. He could go down if the spade is off and he uses the @dA to get to dunny|pg||
nt|ritong: nine tricks, likely|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|hlortz: notice if declarer gets to dummy he will start with 9@S to be able to repeat the finesse but yes he will likely just concede  a @S|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think 7 tricks are likely|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he still had diamonds stopped|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dinos1: cd esily be 6@c if @c were NAT|pg||
pc|dT|nt|odysseus69: hi Cornelia|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Multon its the system ?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: barnet -Jack says hi|pg||
nt|barnets: so dec can see if hearts split 4-3 and the try spades before going to @C finesse|pg||
nt|barnets: so dec has three strings to his bow|pg||
nt|daman: how many strings on a bow?|pg||
nt|daman: I never took violin|pg||
nt|daman: or fiddle for that matter|pg||
nt|barnets: and that gives him a very high percentage|pg||
nt|dinos1: check @hAKQ 1st,if not - play 3r of @s, then @c fin|pg||
nt|barnets: @DK @HAKQ if no brea@SA@SK|pg||
nt|barnets: should win @DK in hand|pg||
nt|barnets: to keep late entry in dummy|pg||

nt|barnets: this looks like a textbook hand|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d8|nt|odysseus69: 1600 kibitzers have all chosen their line|pg||

nt|barnets: works|pg||
pc|s3|nt|barnets: now declarer has lost the ability to work on spades|pg||

nt|barnets: and could maybe x if  3@H was nonforcing|pg||
nt|barnets: west cany have any fit if he has made anon forcing bid|pg||
nt|dburn: North also - if this had been for money, the final contract might wll have been doubled|pg||
nt|kareno: North really heeds to stay off spades.  Club best, obviously, (we can see that) but his holding is unappetizing on the auction/|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Too tough for me to X as South|pg||
nt|barnets: how about match points?|pg||
nt|dburn: that also|pg||
nt|kareno: Perhaps with those lovely clubs and the trump to lead.  But what if east has a spade?|pg||
nt|barnets: so david seems a doubler|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Only in Board a match would I consider it|pg||
nt|barnets: but only if 3@H was non forcing|pg||
nt|dburn: but at IMPs, no one wants to bring back minus 710, however remote the chance|pg||
nt|kareno: Exactly, David.  |pg||
nt|dburn: and if you bring back plus 400 instead of plus 1100 - well, maybe your team-mates didn't bid so much and you gain anyway|pg||
nt|pef: this will be a bid board for fleisher.  east bid 5d after 3h in the closed room and marty fleisher (south) doubled)|pg||
nt|barnets: and in other room 5@DX|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but @SA lead|pg||
nt|kareno: 5@d doubled in CR ... much easier to double that one.|pg||
nt|kareno: No, Roland :(|pg||
nt|lc: Isn't it bad for Zimmermann if their pair is in 5@DX?|pg||
nt|pef: yes, that's why I said a big board for fleisher|pg||
nt|pef: however, I'm told the ace of spades was led, so probably only down 1|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Not good Larry but understandable|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, this is a tough play for North, not looking at all the cards.|pg||
nt|kareno: So I'm counting.  Ace and a club ruffed, two clubs on spades, 750?|pg||
nt|lc: Well, you said "bid" board -- which I read as "bad" and you meant as "big"  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you said "bid", which could have been a typo for "bad" or for "big"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The second spade does not cash|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Down 1|pg||
nt|pef: ah, so that was an ideally ambiguous typo--very difficult to do|pg||
nt|kareno: Ahh, third spade ruffed so down one.  This could be a pickup for Zimmermann actually.|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||

mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|barnets: 17v9 this set |pg||

nt|pef: So it's likely this will be one of the lowest scoring final sets in quite a while|pg||
nt|dburn: er...|pg||
nt|lc: This set of 16 deals was inherently low-scoring in that about half were dull/flattish -- but the level of play has also been good.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulhac:  This is the sort of decision you do not need on the last board of the set if you feel that it has so far not gone your way|pg||
