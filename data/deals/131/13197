nt|poohbear: partner could easily have 3@s and a stiff @c|pg||
nt|othered1: And ACBL trials have been among teams for 40 years, or so.  Before that was pairs which produced some volatile teams.|pg||
nt|mwigor: currently australia has team trials in odd years (bermuda bowl) and pairs trials in even years|pg||
