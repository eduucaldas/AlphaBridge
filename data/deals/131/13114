nt|eleni: Taso 50 years ago anyone would have opened 1@h with E's hand:):) dreadful but true|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will it end -1 or -2 by a @S ruff and miss the @D?|pg||
nt|lelos: i think down 2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Didn't the say min 13HP by that time Eleni? So 12HP ain't good enough|pg||

pc|h3|nt|mcphee: another good think about splitting the @S honors is N is more likely to return the suit if they win it\|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so making 2nt will be a good score I expect|pg||

nt|mcphee: if they play usdca S carded wrong|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if udca, then south must have liked the @c shift. hence north continued the attack|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so north is innocent|pg||
nt|eleni: he might have false carded though, just to mic up the girls|pg||
nt|Gerben42: they were very mixed up|pg||

nt|mcphee: geee harmon, it would not stop me|pg||
nt|harmon: well nuttin stops you|pg||

nt|rodal f: Been nice to meet u. See u tomorrow at 17.00CET|pg||
nt|eleni: right Thanasi, 6 are there all the time, so let us see if Fotis and Aris will get there|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  the strong hand finds out 5-5-2-1 in West and there is a play even with 0 points|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: yee old mexican 2@D|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the inventor of transfer bids must be rich with all the copyright money he gets|pg||

mb|3C|nt|Gerben42: 6@C seems nice|pg||
nt|lelos: not even in 3:)|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  difficult to get there with natural system|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 6@c is perfect|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 3@D must show @C then?!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6nt is more exciting|pg||

mb|d|nt|MolvaM: we want slams that make on a finesse, squeeze, throw-in etc|pg||
nt|mcphee: wow, 4@H opposite a GF strikes me as a very poor bid|pg||
nt|harmon: north doesnt have enuff to move|pg||
nt|petrosa: with clubs 2-2 slam is good:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|r|nt|mcphee: my lord|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: not very enterprising|pg||
nt|mcphee: N did all he could I suppose|pg||
nt|mcphee: the strong hand bids like they have nothing, the weak hand pressed on with key card:)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|MolvaM: maybe because they play against the president|pg||
nt|tez: and 6 nt with open hands|pg||
