pc|d4|nt|zlatan: n guess :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Gerben42: 2@C is a tricky bid, now S will think his hand is worse than it is|pg||

nt|mcphee: well that could lead to a missed slam|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|eleni: I must mention that Mrs. Lina Roussos and Mr. Michael Michalopoulos in the closed room played in a super way correct bridge|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|mcphee: these decent 5-5 hands are tuff when partner opens 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: i would treat the N hand as slam=ish|pg||
nt|lelos: when they find out 1 ace +Q is missing they wont bid this fine @s slam|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|eleni: the other 2 members of the Roussos Team were the President of the Hellenic Bridge Federation Mr.Koumenos and Mr. Costas Panopoulow (conpan on BBO)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's only good because the 10 and 9 are there. I don't think there is any system that can find out about those cards|pg||
nt|mcphee: not clear what this 3@H bid was|pg||
nt|lelos: y indeed if they knew they would bid it|pg||
nt|mcphee: assuming it showed some number of @S|pg||
nt|eleni: Lina Mamidaki-Roussos is roussol on BBO:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps their agreements for 4@S are good trumps|pg||
nt|eleni: Aris Sapounakis is asapou and Lucas Zotos is zentel|pg||
nt|lelos: i m not sure what 3@h shows|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|mcphee: a lot of good cards in S to fit the N hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|petrosa: one down is good bridge|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|mcphee: the t/o dble was getting the e/w pair off to the right fit had E bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: @D is right? @S counts more|pg||
nt|tez: usually 2@s after an initial dbl is a stronger hand|pg||
nt|tez: with E i wld definitely bid 2@d over 1@s|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|rodal f: Wander if the X and X from N made S belive more HPs at N. Don't have there CC|pg||
nt|lelos: i think 1@d shows unbalanced hand hence the 1@c|pg||
nt|eleni: no CCs available today, I hope there will be for the final 4s|pg||
nt|lelos: all other natural|pg||
nt|rodal f: After input from some specs: It seems that S took to much vitamins before the last bid:)|pg||
