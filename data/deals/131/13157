pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: agree. Both jaws is on N|pg||
nt|jallerton: A spade lead looks most likely|pg||
nt|jallerton: forcing declarer to finesse at trick 1|pg||
nt|xenya: best lead -- unbid suit, that simple|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards for all participants are online|pg||

nt|ralfwil: the @s finess|pg||
nt|jallerton: It's a shame Roland isn't playing in the Danish Teams.  I'm sure he'd be in this one!|pg||

nt|jbgood: 12 of the 14 imps difference was the starting point - as a carry over from a previous encounter|pg||
nt|xenya: well done by NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: ready for actionboard :)|pg||
nt|othered1: This may be fun, depending upon who gets hung first by the misfit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both of these pairs use multi-purpose opening 2-bids -- most everything else is natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lilley-Nagy strong NT  Delivera-Robinson ACOL with Weak NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|peacokk: EW better stay low on this one|pg||
nt|jbgood: the Blakset lead is a carry over from previous encounter|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: NS playing 5card major and 15-17nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: EW plays 5-card major and 14+-17 nt|pg||
nt|jbgood: if N can get to know that Auken has a 5 card @d suit - difficult if Fredin jumps in|pg||
nt|xenya: we are in for a bit of fun here i think |pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzey: 3@h = 10-12 and 3@s|pg||
nt|jallerton: EW play strong NT, NS play weak NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d = 5+@c and eighter invitational to game or invitational to slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2nt = minors|pg||
nt|othered1: may turn out to be a test of NS's countermethods to unusual NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I guess NS plays 3@c from North = I have my own suit and I want to bid at least game|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@s = I have my @s-suit|pg||
nt|othered1: Most pairs play something along the lines of "unusual/unusual" where minor suit bids distinguish hands with major suit lengths.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|xenya: indeed -- what should N do now -- would 3@H be forcing -- or should he double or cuebid first|pg||
nt|xenya: so cuebid it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@h directly after 2nt is not forcing -- but 3@c is forcing with own suit - 3@d would have been forcing with @s support|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jallerton: maybe 2@h shows a weak NT type hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: sr I cant explain 2@h and 2@s ... South has not asked W yet :(|pg||
nt|jallerton: http://www2.bridge.dk/Systemkort.aspx?ID=375 for convention cards|pg||
nt|xenya: that didn't get them too far, did it|pg||
nt|othered1: if that's a cue-bid, not simply showing @H with game values (my method)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = FG, 25+BAL or weak 2@H/@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: the double by N paid off|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: hmmm in that context, seems 2@S should be weak 2@S opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: 4nt = 1430 |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 5@c = one ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@h shows only 3-card @c ... and a weak nt-hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: I was close!|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: yes ... you are good :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, makes sense -- 3@C shows @Hs, 3@D would show a spade fit|pg||
nt|othered1: On the auction, 4@H is high enough.  With quiet EW's might get quite a bit higher|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: yes and 3@h natural nonforcing and 3@s natural support nonforcing|pg||
mb|3C|nt|xenya: not easy to see how many tricks declarer can take|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: looks like Nagy is using the same Convention Card that I am :)|pg||
mb|4C|mb|4D|nt|vugraphzey: NS leads 1.3.5.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: was 4@c just a game force?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 4@c is explained as 2-suiter and GF |pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: a likely 2 down..|pg||
nt|jbgood: the double by N was really a tough bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: maybe direct 3@c over 2@h would have been stronger and he has to go via 2@s to sign off|pg||
pc|sT|nt|santyclz: Alerted so might be more.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|santyclz: Thanks Jan.|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Peter Fredin is now calling the TD about th first board ... and the TD has arrived now |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Peter Fredin is explaining to the TD |pg||
nt|jbgood: wrong explanations?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|xenya: not that the contract is in any danger but still|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s6|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jallerton: it looks as though declarer will have to fall back on the @d finesse.  |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jallerton: He might be able to make it double dummy with a red suit squeeze against South, but that must be worse odds|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d8|nt|peacokk: I think it's too hard|pg||
nt|xenya: i can count 11 now|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jbgood: i do too|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|jbgood: and the final double may have warned about the bad trump split so much that declarer actually may bet out cheaper than with no opposition bidding|pg||

nt|beauch:  ok- if well documented and dicussed- but usually of the page by 2nd round of auction|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|frankaus: i think in 10 years time the club players will all be playing transfer advances - the way they play transfers over 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: they give a lot more room to discribe the hand|pg||
nt|beauch:  perhaps - yu mean over openings or overcalls|pg||
nt|frankaus: yes|pg||
nt|beauch:  i used to play rubens advances of overcalls|pg||
pc|s4|nt|beauch:  another problem of transfers - is they give the opponents 2 possible bids - a double and a cue|pg||

nt|ahollan1: we have a very small group in this room -- holler if there's anything special you want me to rant about|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|othered1: Steve Robinson -- "always open a 5-card major" -- wouuld approve of south's action.   But most players would open this hand 1@H, if they open at all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S normally 5+ --- but this is great lead director in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzey: 2@h= 12-15hcp and natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: if they open with a natural 1-bid, that is.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|nt|jallerton: trump lead should be on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I guess @c K|pg||
nt|ahollan1: CC doesn't describe the passed hand 2N -- but sure looks like they are NOT playing Drury|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: I got it|pg||
nt|jallerton: did you have inside information, Jan?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzey: me ... nooo|pg||
nt|othered1: can I assume double was penalty-oriented?|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: The controversial 3-card raise.  I like it.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jbgood: the low club lead may induce N to continue the suit.. |pg||
nt|peacokk: Will Konow be able to read @C3?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: W said: "Make some room for these" when he put down the @ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: dbl = penalty|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: but South is a chicken and pull to 3@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW standard signals|pg||
nt|ahollan1: concensus is 2N=max with 3@S    that's the bid that Drury handles with 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Trump split doesn't help this, but favorable @H position may be useful.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: some like it, I prefer 4 card raise unless no other bid..|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, all|pg||
nt|xenya: hello again|pg||
nt|othered1: @S position isn't necessarily clear to east.  Couldn't south be 2=5=1=5?|pg||
nt|othered1: Of coiurse, east is thinking about lots more than the play to this trick.|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I have been told that the open room "crashed" -- but now we are back - but this board has been played - and South won 8 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: many lead the second best from a bad suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: NS leads are 2.4.|pg||
nt|jbgood: second from top i mean|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: but later in the "game" they play 2.4. with attitude -- so then they play 2. from 4 bad ones|pg||
nt|othered1: Certainly a possible result|pg||

nt|peacokk: Yes, it was|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: imo -- the auction screamed for a trump lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: I don't play hands well enough to be able to afford that|pg||

mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: so -- we only know what ONE of the other pairs has done    there are actually 8 tables in play|pg||

mb|3N!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: kudos to Robinson for the pressure bid of 5@C|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but Gosney didn't have that problem  Tony Nunn opened SOUTH hand 3rd seat 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: looks as if all roads lead to Home|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@c said "I have opened light"|pg||
nt|jallerton: with an extra ace, South would pass|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes, but there can still be a penalty|pg||
nt|othered1: But game on 26 HCP is very normal and none seem to have a play.|pg||
nt|dburn: may be harder to beat off the bottom, as it were|pg||
nt|othered1: Hard to come up with a position (@HKQJxx, prehaps) where north must fly with the ace|pg||
nt|othered1: KQ9xx, rather|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jallerton: at the 1-level when partner can't open the bidding?  Unlikely!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jbgood: 4@h on for EW - not easy to bid.. and S makes 3 @s|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|santyclz: A play on "all Rhodes lead to Rome."|pg||
nt|jbgood: rare that you can play ANY of dummy's 12 cards and win|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If there isn´t - let him still have a choise|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: @s3 said .. I dont like @c ... do you have somethink else|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: it was pointed out to me that Robinson could NOT bid 1@C-1@H:2@S  -- that would be a splinter in support of @H|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|jbgood: now the defense gets a di trick - if he had played on clubs W would have to cash his @d ace to get it|pg||

nt|ahollan1: ahhh 7-9 HCP & 5+@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Low@S is the winner here and east found it.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|peacokk: Looks like +1 to me, 4@H, 1@S, 1@D, 4@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: If West bid 2@d instead of 3@C, that would be non-forcing for many pairs|pg||

nt|ralfwil: rather funny distributions - or? 7 or 8-cards suits en masse!|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: even a club lead does not beat slam, as the hand with @sA does not have another club|pg||

mb|2N|an|5332 or 6322|nt|jbgood: but this time the brakes were too good:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 1@s is Walsh ... might have longer @d suit|pg||
nt|jbgood: easy to remember to alert when you actually have a longer @d suit - easy to forget if not:)|pg||
nt|othered1: Right, a lucky grand can generate action|pg||
nt|dburn: but this Danish version of the dealing program may be worth exporting - just been watching a bunch of part scores in the Camrose, so this is a change for the better|pg||

nt|jbgood: Fredin keeps underleading red aces|pg||
nt|jallerton: South knows that someone is probably void in hearts, so sensibly tries the unbid suit|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3 overtricks in NT???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: didn't Zimmermann [with an Italian pair] win the Gold Coast Team event?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ralfwil: rightly deserved!|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|an|10-12|nt|peacokk: No good layout here for NS|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||

nt|santyclz: Sorry folks, have to leave now.  See you tomorrow.|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: bye ... see you|pg||
nt|jbgood: a difficult hand, even after the lead. Needs 2 entries to play club, must be one in spades after three rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|jbgood: so I dont think he can afford a spade to the ace|pg||

nt|dburn: you might as well play it as opposed to the six - who knows what might happen?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if there is a @D lead that could stop West from cashing @DA before playing the 1st @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|peacokk: Nice sacrifice in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: two boards left .. Konow need 25 imp ... tough|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: 2@h is weak @h support from South .... 2@d would have been a good @h support|pg||

mb|2D|nt|henryb:  now 3@d as a game try by N?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d is a kind of "reversed Drury" ... 2@d shows that W has an opening hand|pg||

nt|jbgood: @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@c is a kind of "reversed Drury" ... 2@d shows that W has an opening hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Robinson 1@C=4+|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|vugraphzey: is this the final countdown|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: lead is @c J|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: another chance lost -- 3N by W would have probably made|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jbgood: 3 @h is by most players just a fight - strange action by N|pg||
nt|jallerton: With West haveing a light opening bid (Fredin passed in the other room) the low road works well|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Wrong-sided as the cards lie.  But somehow 2N with that @H holding deserves some punishment, if not the obvious one.|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: their 2N opener is @C & @D -- i wonder how they handle the various 20+ balanced hands|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzey: seems like we have to congratulate Lars Blakset - Jakob Røn, Håkan Nilsson - Peter Fredin and Mathias Bruun - Knut Blakset with a place in the final|pg||
