mb|1D|mb|p|nt|athene: but maybe i am expecting 2@H to promise more than it did|pg||
mb|2H|an|fit showing|nt|mcphee: fit jump i guess|pg||
nt|athene: if this is fit-showing, they are on their way to 6@D|pg||
nt|mcphee: not really sure, if it is it makes reaching 6@D easy|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|mcphee: most pairs I know do not play fit jumps in this way|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|mcphee: maybe use 6 card key card here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|athene: club lead is normal, just hoping partner will supply the @CQ|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|han: what's double here?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Welcome all to segment 7/9 of the Australian Women's Trial|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|an|!|mb|p|nt|han: is it "please bid 4H if you have hearts"?|pg||
nt|han: or is it just penalty|pg||
nt|sybarra: Berten's had a great hand.... yikes that is over the top..|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@H on a minor suit squeeze?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|han: no chance on this lead|pg||

nt|hedyg: i agree Jeff|pg||
nt|han: west plays 5-6, high-low would not be asking for a ruff but would be suit preferenc|pg||
nt|han: e|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: no cost to leading another club is there?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|han: so 5-6 should ask for a club return|pg||

nt|athene: so both NS pairs will be hopeful of a gain|pg||
nt|mcphee: wow here we have yet another slam|pg||
nt|mcphee: may bid the big one here|pg||
nt|mcphee: tremendous fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|athene: do you want to be in the grand? you can ruff the long diamond good for a heart pitch on 4-3 diamonds and 2-1 trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: no need to guess the ruffing diamond hook|pg||
nt|athene: draw trumps and ruff two spades along the way|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's a pretty fair grand|pg||
mb|4C|an|keycard in C?|nt|athene: certainly over 50% as you can always fall back on the @DK with east if nothing else|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i would just blackwood this with north and bid the grand i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|athene: ah right 4@C was itself blackwood|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: not sure south knows enough about her partner's hand to take charge like that|pg||
nt|athene: if 2@D promised some values maybe you might |pg||
mb|4S|nt|mcphee: that seems weird, maybe 2@D shows more than we know|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|ardek: looks like 3=4D/4H/4S were cues|pg||
nt|athene: north's bidding is consistent with 4@C just being natural and setting the suit|pg||
nt|athene: but there is plenty of room for all sorts of misunderstandings here|pg||
nt|ardek: I'd bet that 2@D = positive (and 2@H would have been a negative)|pg||
nt|athene: 4@C might be RKCB, 4@D might be RKCB...etc|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: so we agree one of the 4bidds was ace asking:)|pg||
nt|ardek: in the open Nagy Lilley, bid 2@D : 2@H, 3@C : 4@S splinter and now 7@C easy|pg||
nt|athene: i am told 4@C was just natural, setting the suit|pg||
nt|athene: i think north should take over after that as she has so much more in support of clubs than her partner could ever envisage|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: although it's rare for the weaker hand to go into blackwood - especially since south might have a void or two, for this sort of bidding|pg||
nt|mcphee: that sounds like it was a good auction Ron|pg||

nt|hedyg: well if not the @Cs certainly looked better|pg||
nt|han: south showed 4+ hearts and dummy has 1098|pg||
mb|p|nt|han: not a great suit to switch to|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3D|an|keycard|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: Thompson is thinking...|pg||
mb|4D|an|keycard|mb|p|mb|4H|an|14|nt|han: he didn't know that one club trick was enough, then he also needed spades to split 3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: in @H he needed 2 finesses , in @c just 1|pg||
nt|han: but he could combine chances, hook heart, cash AK of clubs, if queen drops, test spades and if they split he doesn't need the secondheart hook|pg||
nt|hedyg: and then 1 of the black suits to come in|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: well 3 @C  is better that 4 sp (I think) |pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: pull AK@S before @d ruff|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|helene_t:  difficult to reach 2@h playing standard methods. E might want to bid 2@h over 1NT but for most pairs that would show extra values|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: and I guess that is the end with this hand|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT opener in the other room was RCO? showing 55, non-touching suits?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3@C pass or correct and now 3@D would be @S@D, weak and 3@S was @S@D, strong?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: i am guessing wildly :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: looks like we should reach 3N|pg||
nt|athene: yes, west might have tried 3NT on that auction if that's what her partner had showed|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|athene: now 3@D, 3NT|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mcphee: oh my|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S interesting....|pg||
nt|mcphee: this seems like a bad choice|pg||
nt|athene: well, east doesn't have such good spades; might offer 3nt anyway|pg||
nt|mcphee: i agree you face a misfit hand type, but same 9 tricks to make 3N as 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: do not see how E can try 3N|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mcphee: well she did|pg||
nt|athene: auctions are so cramped after these jump shifts, it's normal expert practice for responder to bid a courtesy 3major along the way expecting opener to go 3NT anyway unless it's a ...|pg||
nt|athene: freak|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|mcphee: i apprecaite what you mean Bill, bid 3N on the strenth of partners @C stop|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|athene: no reason for north to cover here i don't think|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mcphee: well I do not think the W hand would hold 5 or more @H failing to bid them over 3D|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|han: I don't expect Bertens and Westra to get to game after 1NT|pg||
nt|helene_t:  3@h shows a good spade raise. 3@s ould have been weaker|pg||
mb|p|nt|helene_t:  would|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: so much for @cs|pg||
nt|han: and certainly not after 2H|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: sorry misread the handwritting|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|han: maybe it is possible, if Huub now bids 3C|pg||
nt|hedyg: gazilli would work well here|pg||
nt|fann4: They got to 5@C other table after a 2@H rebid.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would bid 2 @C on the first round,  (yes I know have 6 hts) |pg||
nt|han: Westra has a difficult decision|pg||
nt|han: I must admit I would have bid 2C instead of 2H|pg||
nt|fann4: Me too.|pg||
nt|hedyg: that @c suit is certainly good enough to bid|pg||
nt|han: don't really understand 2H with these suits, but in old school you have to rebid your major with a minimal 6-4|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe they do not have to have 4 to bid it |pg||
nt|fann4: And the @H suit is weak enough to not have to rebid.|pg||
nt|hedyg: over 2@c by S N could have bid 2@s etc|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|nt|hedyg: ok so lets try 3@s now|pg||
nt|han: 3S keeps 3NT in the game|pg||
nt|sybarra: and one suggestion is that N could bid 2 @C  over 1 ht |pg||
nt|han: I think Bertens will bid 3NT, he has told his story|pg||
nt|hedyg: if Bertens finds a 4@d bid now..|pg||
nt|han: and he even has help in diamonds|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: think again? LOL|pg||
nt|han: they reached it, now they have to make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: they got it right,  thats why they are playing :)|pg||
nt|han: Schollaardt loves underleading kings|pg||
nt|han: so he'll be happy here, spades or diamonds|pg||
nt|han: I would guess diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Westra says: I meant 3@s as a super card for @c's and he saw that as well|pg||
nt|han: because of the auction|pg||
pc|s2|nt|han: high from  even with an honor|pg||
nt|han: slavinski leads|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes and Bertens understood that|pg||
nt|han: toughest lead for declarer|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|mwigor: maybe a chance to make|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|han: he has only 1 loser but where will he get his tricks?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c3|nt|mwigor: @sA ruffing @s hook is probably best both on the hand and single dummy|pg||
nt|mwigor: but looks like she cant quite cope with the 4-1 trump break|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h4|nt|han: this is a bit dangerous|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s5|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|c4|nt|sybarra: he seems to have a plan |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|mwigor: needed to keep the low trump in dummy to have any hope of setting up lots of tricks without losing control|pg||

nt|sybarra: cu jeff |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: and after 19 minutes the last round will begin|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Monique :)|pg||
nt|han: Huub pointed out that his line here was 100%|pg||
nt|han: if the club finesse loses then he still makes|pg||
nt|han: Also, he couldn't combine his chances in 2NT|pg||
nt|han: He was squeezed on the run of the clubs to make an early decision|pg||
nt|han: hearts was by far the best chance for two extra tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: about 5 minutes left before we restart|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry our song and dance routine is not enlivening |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|han: it is quite uncommon here|pg||
pc|d7|nt|helene_t:  I suppose NS play a weak 1NT opening, so that the 1NT rebid shows 15-17 points. |pg||

pc|dK|pg||

nt|han: This is a tricky hand for NS|pg||
nt|han: we know the club queen is dropping|pg||
nt|han: but will Huub test that before he takes the second heart hook?|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|helene_t:  the club lead actually gives N a chance of making the contract, if she finds the queen of spades|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: he will disc @hs|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|hedyg: all eggs in the @H basket|pg||
pc|c9|nt|helene_t:  but she doesnt kno that hearts are 5-3. if they were 4-4 then conceeding a diamond trick would be the way to make the contract without having to guess spades|pg||

mb|1D|nt|helene_t:  multi 2@d ( a weak 2 in either hearts or spades). 2@h is to play in case E has hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|hedyg: 1@c 2+?|pg||
nt|han: On the other hand, should Schollaardt have prevented this by returning a diamond before declarer had the chance to play the spade ace?|pg||
nt|han: I think so|pg||
nt|han: yes 1C is 2+, as it is for almost every pair in  this field|pg||
nt|helene_t:  North has an awkward hand since she could double a 2@s opening and bid 2NT over a 2@h opening, but she doesn't know which E has|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: i guess 1@d really is @ds and not a xfer|pg||

pc|s3|nt|hedyg: hard for S to find a double for @c lead|pg||

mb|1S|nt|athene: the defence just have to set up their diamond trick before the @SA gets knocked out|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|athene: that means not playing three rounds of hearts|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mcphee: not sure what methods n.s use|pg||
nt|cbernstn: 3nt?|pg||
nt|athene: east has normal @HQ lead, and if declarer ducks twice, west can signal she has four, so east knows a third round isn't cashing and might give away a vital tempo|pg||
nt|mcphee: Cindy has an eye|pg||
nt|athene: but if north covers the heart at some point, west might go wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: difficult, and need to have good agreements on carding|pg||
nt|athene: if 3@S isn't forcing, i guess you pass it with south's hand|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: playing weak jump shifts it should probably be forcing - but it's a common source of misunderstandings for sure|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|mcphee: most pairs would play that jump nf |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|athene: west should give count on the @HQ since she is known to have the @HA|pg||
nt|athene: do EW play upside down?|pg||

nt|athene: still not a trivial diamond switch to find|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|s4|pg||

pc|sK|nt|athene: you can't pick up @SAx with west because you are never ducking the second round|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: so this is just running into a possible club ruff for not much benefit|pg||
nt|mcphee: not when you need 3-3 |pg||
nt|Walddk3: True, enterering dummy to play a spade up is an illusion|pg||
nt|Walddk3: If West has the stiff ace, East has a trump trick|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes, unless yu intend to play a low trump next|pg||

mb|1S|nt|athene: 2@C presumably majors - this won't work out so well for EW|pg||
nt|athene: East will surely force to at least the three level, and definitely will play in hearts|pg||
nt|helene_t:  2@c showing majors, or showing hearts+another suit, Fiona? Do you know?|pg||
nt|athene: the question is whether declarer can hold the losers to @CAK, @DA, @HK|pg||
mb|p|nt|han: We can see the result of one of EW's competitors, Verbeek-van Zwol|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: does Jansma sit,  yes  |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: Well, they will still gain imps for down one - West in the other room definitely took her eye off the ball|pg||
nt|athene: got the @HJ lead and tried the @HQ, so north got three ruffs|pg||
mb|p|pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|han: This looks like down 1, good save for EW as Wortel is unlikely to find the low club lead necessary to beat 4H!|pg||
nt|han: it also gives the same score as 3NT-2 at the other table|pg||
nt|han: I'm surprised that Begas did not act over 3NT by the way|pg||
nt|fann4: Presumably the @H3 cannot be from Q543|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H hard to read?|pg||
nt|han: maybe the colors made him pass, he figured that if he could make a game, 3NT was probably doing down quite a bit|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|fann4: This is a bit tricky. N is thinking about building a @C trick before the @SA goes.|pg||
nt|hedyg: passed the ball to Jansma|pg||
nt|fann4: On the underlead S now 'knows' N has the @SA|pg||
nt|hedyg: smallest @H probably asking for a @c return|pg||
nt|fann4: Right - and the suit preference implication.|pg||
nt|han: the underlead might have been necessary, picture declarer with a singleton spade and Qx of clubs|pg||
nt|fann4: Declarer coulbd be 1-2-8-2|pg||
nt|fann4: could...|pg||
nt|han: south would have to return a club to defeat it two tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes good defensive play by Paulissen|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: I think the best chance for south to beat this by two, is to attack in clubs - play three rounds of clubs giving a ruff/discard|pg||
nt|athene: then hold up in trumps with the intention of leading a fourth club and getting trump control|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|d7|nt|athene: it might not quite work as the cards lie, but that's the general sort of strategy you follow against a 4-4 fit when you have Axxx trumps|pg||
nt|athene: and South has almost that|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|nt|helene_t:  If dummy ruff clubs twice, S will make @h9|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: yes and if declarer ruffs one club in each hand, south gets a long heart|pg||
nt|helene_t:  oh now she played @h10 anyway|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|d2|pg||

nt|fann4: Claiming time!|pg||
pc|d8|pc|hA|pc|s4|pg||

mb|p|nt|mcphee: not so clear they will even try for game here|pg||

nt|cbernstn: best line not so clear here--|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: it's actually quite interesting - declarer must play the clubs so as not to let west win two of them and play two rounds of trumps|pg||

nt|poohbear: Fee you at this table?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: true :) but rebidding 1nt with a singleton in partner's suit is more common than opening 1nt with a singleton i think|pg||

pc|cA|nt|athene: it's a low-level contract; you have trump control - probably there's no great urgency to get busy doing things|pg||

pc|d6|nt|han: a spade return will certainly make Schollaardt nervous but there is little he can do but finesse in diamonds and hearts|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|poohbear: a low @c now is best but declarer can still make by playing off winners and conceding tricks rto north who will have to give dummy the 9th trick|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||

nt|athene: or if only 5-4, a really good hand|pg||
nt|athene: yes, strange non-double of 4@H|pg||
nt|cbernstn: but club lead will prob set 6 as well|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps west is waiting for the @H8 before she risks a double|pg||
nt|mcphee: some folks use this xfer sequence and then major bid to show a 5-4|pg||
nt|athene: it depends how you play stayman-then-3minor |pg||

nt|cbernstn: best play in spades is low to J if need a heart pitch--and that will fail|pg||
nt|athene: actually it might be easier with no heart lead? you have a chance to get a heart away on a spade|pg||
nt|athene: let's say @CJ lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: west missed the boat not taking time to dble 4@H|pg||

nt|athene: ah no, sorry, east ruffs in before you throw the heart|pg||
nt|Walddk3: She is a hot favourite to go down unless she gets a spade lead|pg||

nt|poohbear: havent seen a 9-11 NT in a long time!|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|fann4: As you said earlier Han 'When in Holland".... do as the Dutch do.|pg||
nt|sybarra: same auction as other table |pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d major 1suiter?|pg||
nt|han: Paulissen takes a more direct approach|pg||
nt|fann4: I'm referring to super light weak 2 openings you discussed.|pg||
nt|han: there doesn't seem to be any lead that challenges declarer|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fann4: 3-3 breaks in the pointed suits make it easy.|pg||
nt|han: this is not easy for declarer, if east has Kx or Qx then it is better to play low|pg||
nt|hedyg: J@h makes it even easier|pg||
nt|han: so that the suit blocks|pg||
nt|fann4: @HJ is the 10th trick, and finally E will have to give a @C trick for 11 tricks.|pg||
nt|han: that might be necessary if west has the club ace|pg||
nt|han: playing low and taking the ace at trick 1 would be the way to go then, but now it is the way to go down|pg||
nt|hedyg: better assume W has 2 honours in @H for his bid|pg||
nt|fann4: Playing low is still ok. He can duck the @H and later still make 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|hedyg: can he if W has the A@C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably trying to figure out if Schollardt would lead low holding kqxxxxx |pg||
nt|han: if he plays for Kx or Qx he has to win trick 1 with the ace|pg||
nt|fann4: But looking at it single dummy it has some problems.|pg||
nt|han: with spades and diamonds 3-3 he'll still make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|han: very dangerous problem|pg||
nt|han: What's more likely, that west has KQxxxx or either Kxxxxx or Qxxxxx?|pg||
nt|han: the 2 shows an even number with at least one honor|pg||
nt|hedyg: KQ|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: it looks as though 2@D was not game-forcing for either EW pair here|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise west would surely bid 2nt or 3@D over 2@S|pg||
nt|helene_t:  yes, they play Acol|pg||
mb|p|nt|han: with K109 or Q109 he would have led higher|pg||
nt|hedyg: or an odd nr with no honours|pg||
nt|sybarra: he can not see 9 yet  now closer |pg||
nt|han: I think so too Hedy, good decision by Jansma|pg||
nt|poohbear: I assume 2@d was a transfer. I dont like transfers playing weak NT cause it gives next hand 2 chances to get into the auction|pg||
pc|c5|nt|poohbear: 4@h makes by force 5@h tricks 2@d 2@c and 1@s |pg||
nt|poohbear: so as long as declarer pulls trumps no worries|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|poohbear: The open room EW has an EXCELLENT mathpoint result|pg||
nt|poohbear: -400 will beat all the -420s and 450s|pg||
nt|poohbear: not as good at imps|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: even if declarer leads a spade to the @SK early it doesn't really help her all that much|pg||
nt|helene_t:  4NT quantitative, E can pass but with two points more than she already showed she must bid 6|pg||
nt|athene: she doesn't want to risk another one because then she would go down if south ducked @SAJx and diamonds might be breaking all the time|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|han: I think we can rule out the case of ann odd number without honors Hedy, Maarten is crazy but wouldn't bid on five small hearts|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: falsecarding by both opps on @s?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|sybarra: mnot the cash |pg||
nt|sybarra: *now |pg||
pc|d8|pc|hK|pc|dT|nt|athene: now the question is whether declarer can strip-squeeze north|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer still Ok to draw trump. @s ace stops the force|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|athene: she has to put the @SA onside|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|hedyg: i agree Han, but as explanation of Slawinski leads for opps...|pg||
pc|d9|nt|hedyg: for specs*|pg||
nt|poohbear: now time even if 2 @c losers|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d6|pc|c3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|han: +1 just like the other table|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer even has a finesse in @ds for the overtrick. Seems no risk as there is no way East led high from Jxxxxx|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|athene: she is just playing for spades 3-3 with the @SA right i think|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: but it could have made|pg||

nt|athene: i don't want to risk them bidding it and making it :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would certainly have dbled|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: i know in his book, Michael Rosenberg complains that Zia used to do that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cbernstn: easy for ns to get overboard on this one|pg||
nt|athene: he never made lead-directing doubles because he wanted opps to bid slams - he was confident rosenberg would find the right lead|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|athene: when he did make "lead-directing" doubles they were usually three small or something to mislead declarer in the play :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: last board in this final|pg||
nt|athene: very tough hand but 6NT had more practical chance than 6@D, since declarer was never going to finesse the diamond right away|pg||

nt|hedyg: ty Shirley :)|pg||
nt|fann4: I'm betting another coke they stay out!|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: Tks all.|pg||

mb|2C|nt|sybarra: and to NBB,  bringing us lots of interesting tourneys, esp. this one |pg||
nt|han: bids keycards I mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3@H relay?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: N can't be the one to take over.|pg||

pc|h5|nt|poohbear: Goes down fast on a @d lead|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|helene_t:  5@c a good ssacrifice against 4@h, and EW cant even double it on this auction|pg||
pc|hK|nt|poohbear: need to shift to a @c BEFORE the @d ruff to get the extra trick |pg||
nt|poohbear: otherwise East gets endplayed|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||

nt|ardek: N-S have a heart part-score and E should make 2@C|pg||

nt|fann4: No more bets for me again:)|pg||

pc|c3|nt|sybarra: commentators curse,  keeps us out of casinos also |pg||
nt|han: diamond lead makes it 0% that declarer goes down|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|h6|pg||
pc|cA|nt|poohbear: this is often the case in partials. When you have entries then it is right to establish tricks before giving partner ruffs|pg||

pc|c6|nt|hedyg: and claim!|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fann4: Just cokes - but bad enough.|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: ty all, have a nice afternoon/day :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: Han you need to tell us |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: thank you all for watching and thanks to White House for supporting this tournament|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: without the support of Max Abram and Herman Drenkelford we would not have such a great tournament|pg||
nt|sybarra: and such a great venue |pg||
nt|sybarra: White House is a renovated tennis club,  (still courts)  but absolutely beautiful!!|pg||
nt|han: Hop-Helmich also bid this 6H|pg||
nt|han: and missed the 6S|pg||
nt|han: and bid the 3NT|pg||

mb|3C|nt|han: Schollaardt's wife and children have arrived|pg||
nt|helene_t:  4414 opens 1@c even in a 4-card major system. this is because if opening the hand 1@h, she would have no rebid over a 2@d response|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and a slam in the offing |pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: I  might be wrong |pg||
nt|shevek: I think they pplay strong NT in 3rd|pg||

nt|helene_t:  yes, we saw E opening 1NT on 17 in 3rd|pg||

nt|athene: declarer set off on diamonds but then changed her mind and went over to hearts|pg||
nt|shevek: so south is marked with at most 3-3 in the Maj|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: @SA, small diamond taken by east with the @DQ, spade to the @SJ|pg||

nt|athene: you can come to nine tricks by getting either hearts or clubs right|pg||
nt|shevek: exactely|pg||
nt|athene: yes, after the @SJ held in the other room declarer realised that even if she got those diamonds set up, she wasn't necessarily reaching them|pg||

nt|athene: leave the hearts to the end|pg||
nt|athene: you will find out east has 5-2-4-2|pg||
nt|athene: of course the @CQ drops then anyway so it will be easy if you kept the @CJ|pg||
nt|athene: but there are ways you might go wrong - for example, you might try to drop the @H10 intending to fall back on the club finesse if it doesn't work|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|athene: so cash @HA, then lead to @HQ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: and if hearts are unhappy, you cash the @SK and play a club to the @CJ|pg||
nt|athene: but that's the sort of thing you leave right to the end |pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer going for the complete crossruff|pg||

nt|athene: no trick source, it's non-vul...but 3nt isn't the worst bid ever, maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, i would hit it with north's hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: well off the hook with no dble|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: not so much to increase the penalty, but because you think the double might make the difference between making and going down|pg||
