mb|d|mb|1S|nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|sybarra: hello David and Warren |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|davidstern: 5@D east of course but not that easy to get to with limited resources|pg||
nt|sybarra: have to stay out of slam here   |pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: 5@D is the perfect spot|pg||
nt|benjent: Helness was warned off ... but rejected the warning|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Last time I said here we go up and running the table closed down immediately so not this time|pg||
nt|pelu: N.? who has the @ss? - red against green he sh trust East!|pg||
nt|hlortz: helness might be suspicious of the @S bid but it was vul vs not..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: shhhhhhhhhsss David,  dont do that |pg||
nt|davidstern: Everybody a fan of reversing?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Richard, if you give me declarer, contract and number of tricks on 17 and 18, I will give you the codes to insert in MOVIE|pg||
nt|davidstern: I wouldnt mind opening 1@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: with reverse, seems to me you should bid 3 @D |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I think it's worth a reverse|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@H would suggest 6/5|pg||
nt|hlortz: peter we seem to think alike :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|davidstern: Now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|benjent: Helgemo in absolutely no doubt about what he wanted to do ... defend :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: Playing strength is enormous|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|davidstern: So he has shown his 5/6|pg||
nt|pelu: how is a @h-contract for EW?|pg||
nt|benjent: Saelensminde is going to score the @s6 on a trump promotion|pg||
nt|pelu: I can count 9-10 tricks - even on at @H-lead|pg||
nt|benjent: No entry to the board to take the @c finesse, and the defence aren't that likely to take it for him, so I'm going to place an early bet on 1 off|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|nt|davidstern: So a flat one here|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 5 @D is fast arrival |pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes black suit holdings less than ideal|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: just unfortunate no club ace with one of them |pg||
pc|d9|pc|s9|nt|hlortz: only 1 ?  at least i'd say|pg||
nt|pelu: no 1 off a good bet :)|pg||
nt|benjent: with 2@h making, no harm in 1 or 2 off|pg||
nt|hlortz: toss the @C on this trick and 1 off would be a miracle :)|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d4|pg||

nt|benjent: Saelensminde is being cautious, and Brogeland is thinking about whether that @h9 is caution or intent|pg||
nt|benjent: That is, is good ole pard trying to grab the lead to do something clever, or is he just trying to make sure we concede a cucker trick?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|d|mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: anyone for 2 @S 4th suit?|pg||
nt|davidstern: I have had slams bid against me where the @HK is onside as well!!!!|pg||
nt|davidstern: Maybe no need for 2@S as has shown hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: depends on what 2 @D was |pg||
nt|kareno: Finally the clubs are in the auction|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: Richard, our operator, has caught us up re scores  wd  |pg||
nt|benjent: Doubling 4@c may not be enough to convince West to have a go .. East probably had to overcall directly to get West excited|pg||
nt|pelu: is that X for the lead or a @C-suit? - in red normal for the lead|pg||
nt|hlortz: i rather dislike spinters on stiff ace . opinions?|pg||
nt|pelu: but why X a splinter if u dont have the suit?|pg||
nt|benjent: I agree Henry, distorts partner's view of your hand - and his|pg||
nt|pelu: agree, henry, but 41C is the only normal bid on the N-hand|pg||
nt|benjent: Fantoni-Nunes play X of a splinter like this as "don't make the obvious lead" ... in this case, hearts|pg||
nt|kareno: Indeed, I often play with the agreement that if I haven't bid the suit, then double of splinter suggests another lead.|pg||
nt|benjent: right ... let me clarify what I said .. Fantunes would X 4@c here to say DON'T lead @h's|pg||
nt|kareno: In this case, I would have overcalled clubs for those who think I wouldn't get to compete in that suit.|pg||
nt|hlortz: also not fond of the @D Q on a stiff in partner's suit ...|pg||
nt|benjent: Helgemo has a pretty good hand ... how good depends on their agreements about 4@c|pg||
mb|5C|nt|benjent: Presumably Helness had other ways to show a good raise ... so maybe 4@c is some medium hand, handing over the news just in case|pg||
nt|benjent: Or maybe 4@c is more usually a void (huge for Helgemo)|pg||
nt|hlortz: but they surely know their agreements still they are getting dangerously high|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Meanwhile, Fantunes are in 5@s|pg||
nt|kareno: Getting tippy.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|davidstern: In the CR it went @HJ lead and claim 11 tricks so dont know what happened|pg||
nt|sybarra: @S lead coming here I think |pg||
nt|davidstern: I suspect declarer played @D to King|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|pelu: now NS a too high - even 4@S need carefull play - Fredin was -1 in 4@S - played @S to K first time :(|pg||
nt|benjent: 5@s is ... poor ... but the layout has some friendly bits to it|pg||
nt|benjent: Helgemo won't get the @s's wrong - he can't afford a safety play, whereas Fredin might have thought he could in 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: I know DD thar 5@S can win - but this is not a DD-contest :)|pg||
nt|benjent: Now Helness, looking at a big pile of Aces and a @d cue from partner is wondering if he has what he's supposed to have for slam|pg||
nt|hlortz: 5@C from helgemo confuses me also...|pg||
nt|benjent: Give partner KQxxx xxx Axx xxx ... is that too much for his auction, or does his auction highlight the @h problem, and the need for Aces and good diamonds|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that 5@c (the splinter suit) = slam interest but no cue bid|pg||
nt|kareno: I can feel that the air is charged at that table!|pg||
nt|hlortz: each pair would like to score a telling blow early in the set...|pg||
nt|benjent: And somebody may get charged with crimes against bidding in just a moment|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Actually, everyone looks like he is about to fall asleep....  :)|pg||
nt|kareno: What, even Helness?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Yes, his head is bowed ... maybe he is praying.|pg||
nt|benjent: Perhaps a spot of transcendental meditation to help him navigate serenely through this bidding problem|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|warrens:  most likely pitched a spade and a heart on the AK @C's and played a trump up|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|kareno: I must tell you, I was doing vugraph in Albuquerque at the world championships and as I was reporting, one of the Polish players fell asleep at the table.  True story!|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|d7|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes no second entry to dummy for second diamond finesse even if you pick it|pg||
nt|hlortz: east would love to double this hesitant auction but doesnt want to reveal the trump location possibly|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|kareno: Where does he plan to put those hearts?|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|davidstern: Silly game really - if South is 1-1 in hearts and clubs is cold|pg||

pc|h7|nt|hlortz: i see fantunes brought 5@S home to win 13|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|davidstern: Not if he knows he is leading by 45 imps|pg||
pc|h7|nt|benjent: I'm going to speculate that 3@d showed @h support, they exchanged a couple of cues, wheeled out rkc and bob's your uncle|pg||

nt|pelu: Fleischer now 26-0 against Sweden|pg||
nt|kareno: The boards got swingy the moment I arrived I guess :)|pg||
nt|benjent: Basically all lines need the @s finesse, so Helgemo seems to be choosing between @h 3-2 and @s 3-2|pg||

nt|kareno: I would actually overcall with the east hand.  Anyone else?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|davidstern: Commentator in CR saying a few specs may have had a heartg attack believing that they were playing 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Yup, much rather come back with a X, than have to X twice|pg||
nt|hlortz: i would - might be hard to get to @H othwise|pg||
nt|benjent: Or volunteer my marginal suit at the 8 level|pg||
nt|kareno: So he boxed himself into having to way overbid the hand.|pg||
nt|benjent: And I mean 8 - there are plenty of days where this 4@h will get greeted by the Axe Man|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes he's bought a fair dummy|pg||
nt|benjent: Meanwhile, Brogeland knows he has an absolute ripper of a hand|pg||
nt|benjent: This may not be it|pg||
nt|kareno: And here's poor Brogeland thinking perhaps his partner has his bid!!|pg||
nt|kareno: Yet another reason to start with an overcall|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree with u Karen. E had for an X over 3@S.|pg||
nt|pelu: 5½ loser and only a 5 card suit - what did Sælensminde have for lunch/diner? :)|pg||
nt|benjent: EW may be wishing they could defend 3@sX soon|pg||
nt|kareno: Those weak 2's with weak suits are the modern preempt style.  Not mine, not in first position.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:  wow, now that's a weak raise!|pg||
nt|benjent: You'd open 3@s instead?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|davidstern: Anyone for 3NT by West?|pg||
nt|sybarra: hey,  I have 3 trmps with ou pard |pg||
nt|davidstern: Unless 2NT showed 18-19|pg||
nt|benjent: Well, Brogeland clearly knows EXACTLY what Saelensminde had for lunch, and he didn't like it|pg||
nt|pelu: I just miss @S10, karen! Q 10 9 in top ik ok for me|pg||
nt|kareno: How about pass?|pg||
nt|benjent: Heathen :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, QT9 I accept.|pg||
nt|kareno: LOLBen ;)|pg||
nt|hlortz: so even with this great dummy 4@H looks iffy|pg||
nt|kareno: And five has no play whatsoever.|pg||
nt|benjent: Nothing like thinking about making a slam try, passing, and watching partner sail one off ... in a contract he bid all by his lonesome|pg||
nt|hlortz: these days at favorable you'lucky to get a 6th @S karen - the roth-stone days are over :)|pg||
nt|pelu: ok, Karen, but here u are green against red - and 6-4-2-1, sp that could compensate for the missing @S10|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|kareno: You think you will keep me from bidding the spades later?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|warrens:  I think it does show 18-19.  |pg||
nt|davidstern: If so all seems normal|pg||
nt|davidstern: I guess 3NT would remove the heart stopper thoughts in East's mind|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kareno: I pass, sorry.|pg||

nt|rodal f: A storry told once are often right, or Peter?|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|hlortz: nice k@D to keep s on lead|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|kareno: Not really.  Partner will know something is wrong about my hand for a weak 2.  |pg||
nt|hlortz: i still dont see 10 tricks for declarer tho|pg||
nt|benjent: He's sure got some serious problems|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|warrens:  Yes, but systemically it would imply a 6322 hand or something similiar|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d6|pg||
nt|benjent: He knows @s's are (suprisingly!) 6-2 - what lunatic would play the 2nd round knowing that they're 5-3?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|davidstern: Endplay on North for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes a 15-17 with solid minor is normal treatment but as partner has passed .....???|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s9|nt|pelu: Levin also in 4@H - but he did'nt bid on his own - @SK to A and @DJ!!! A from S - now in better shape|pg||
nt|rodal f: @H) will grow now anyhow Sillaplay his hand.|pg||
nt|rodal f: @H9|pg||
nt|benjent: Neat @dJ by Levin - successfully made it look like he was trying to sneak @dKQJ through|pg||
nt|benjent: He can almost afford to concede a ruff here ... if @hK is onside short|pg||
nt|benjent: But he knows that Helness started with @sQ, @dQ and @cK so the @hK together with the 6 card @s suit is probably too much for a weak 2|pg||
nt|benjent: In these sacriligious times|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kareno: Yes, @hK is marked in south.  |pg||
pc|c9|pc|s7|pg||
nt|kareno: That would be my play followed by a heart to dummy.  |pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|nt|kareno: He is going down, though.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|benjent: Helgemo is happily preserving his trump strength for later ... pretty routine play|pg||

nt|benjent: This line basically concedes one off|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|c2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|benjent: If South didn't have 4 @h's, he would have some card left to exit with and still score his @hK|pg||
mc|9|nt|sybarra: going for the endplay|pg||
nt|davidstern: As Tim Bourke points out West should have played @H10 at T1 - it yields 12 tricks on a strip squeeze! |pg||

nt|kareno: Brogeland can give a ruff to his partner.  But trump is better I think.|pg||
nt|benjent: The EW @c's are just good enough to keep Helness out of dummy, so a @s ruff would actually be neatly effective. |pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, you're right, I think spade ruff gains a trick.|pg||
nt|hlortz: seems a trump is 3 off perhaps @S ruff is also|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Declarer has no such info here|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: If you happened to make a "discovery" play by finding out hwp had heart ace, then, presumably, down you wld go|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c2|pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|sybarra: now just to untangle it |pg||
nt|Walddk2: If I were thinking about finessing, it would be through West|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: As did Nunes|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|kareno: More IMPs to Strul!!|pg||
nt|hlortz: bessis's will be glad to have this quarter done...|pg||
nt|benjent: Brogeland is fairly confident he's looking at his side's only defensive tricks. He's just going to try to make sure he has a way to get off lead on a regular basis|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|vdoubleu: Nite all:)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: (for now)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good night|pg||
nt|warrens:  ciao|pg||
nt|sybarra: gn all,  see you in 1 1/2 hours |pg||
pc|s3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|benjent: The big pile of diamonds in South's hand is bad news for Brogeland ... he now will probably need to cash up his side winners in order to get his @sK|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s8|pc|s7|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c7|pc|s9|nt|benjent: On the run of the diamonds, Brogeland is going to have to slice his hand up horribly|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|kareno: So long as east holds his club nine, they'll survive.  |pg||
pc|d5|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|rodal f: @C9 a good card for EW now.|pg||
mc|8|nt|kareno: Now you see why the nine of clubs mattered.|pg||
nt|benjent: What a turn around.|pg||
nt|kareno: mmm.  how many unanswered IMPs?|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: LIke old Roth-Stone, sound opening bid systems work quite well when you do open.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: 100 a trick says Nunes|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kiwibridge: amazing comeback, as I said before, great job Joe and fellow commentaors, specs you have been wonderful and this has been a great set of bridge|pg||
nt|mcphee: J@D is a very nice ticket to see Nunes is thinking to himself:)|pg||
nt|othered1: and north knows exactly what's going on and leads appropriately|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|kiwibridge: the final set in a few  minutes, who knows how it will pan out, DON'T miss it @H|pg||
nt|mcphee: so 50 imps have gone to Strul in the last 6 boards|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mcphee: quite amazing number |pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|othered1: @D7 wassuit pref, I assume|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mcphee: he was encouraging partner to lead more @D ED|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: L)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: to those who said Fantunes were fading, think again :) @H|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||
nt|mcphee: they said Raiding|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ah sounds the same :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: right|pg||
nt|othered1: who, here at least, has said that they're fading? |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: many specs|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kiwibridge: many many even :(|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: front runners, they.|pg||
mc|5|nt|mcphee: the boys miss a couple of slams and they consider this fading?|pg||
nt|mcphee: they missed them on purpose to encourage the opps|pg||
nt|mcphee: like a handicap|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they've made many comebacks over the years, they just keep exciting us, wonderful to watch|pg||
nt|othered1: A good sign that they are not fading is that they kept their composure and didn't make desperate bids and plays, even though down enough to  make people think their strategy was ...|pg||
nt|othered1: fading, too.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well said ed|pg||
nt|mcphee: Ed writes political speechs also, for those intersted in campaign :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Nope, I'm as apolitical as they come.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1900+ kibs in action between the 4 tables in play, see more again soon|pg||
nt|mcphee: well I may be to stay for the next set|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: you'd have to wouldn't you Bob?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 50 imps without reply last several boards|pg||
nt|mcphee: 1@C was opened in the other room so S balanced 1N and is playing it there|pg||
nt|mcphee: so another 8 imps coming I would guess|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we should be re-starting now so I guess a small delay - enough time for coffee at least :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: the other match is a 5 imp difference|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: yes, i'd estimate 15 min|pg||
nt|mcphee: I will be bock|pg||
nt|othered1: These close matches make up for all of the routs yesterday.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: when the other table is finished, I'll close this table momentarily to check scores and be back in 10 min or so|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx again all see you very soon|pg||
