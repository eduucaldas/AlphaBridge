pc|dA|nt|brolucius: All four semi-finalist teams were seeded between 10 and 16, largely because they contained many non-US pairs and these do not attract such a high rating in the seeding (it seems).|pg||

pc|dA|nt|henryb:  There is something called the K-R evaluater, which approcimately uses a 6-4-2-1-1/3 pointcount, and then subtracts 1/4 from the sum. The South hand comes to 30 1/3|pg||
mc|10|nt|dburn: but if East throws (as he has done) a diamond, then declarer will make an overtrick|pg||

nt|henryb:  yes|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|hawe45:  E/W can make 3 NT here - but they have to bid something|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: whatever it is, it seems a popular choice|pg||

nt|daman: Frank Multon    http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3717|pg||
nt|dburn: no, I expect West bid 2@h, because I expect that East actually doubled 1@h|pg||
nt|henryb:  ah|pg||
nt|dburn: would be truly remarkable for Multon to pass|pg||
nt|henryb:  good point. the 4-3-3-3 takeout double|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|dburn: and West cue-bid 2@h to show (with his follow-up) a good 3@c bid|pg||

nt|daman: Pierre Zimmerman     http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=4458|pg||
nt|dburn: and East did pretty well over that, given West's passed-hand status|pg||
nt|henryb:  it looks like 8 tricks, but he may make 9 as North has a tough time discarding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: that's if he leads @H|pg||
mb|4C|nt|daman: whack|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: a one-way finesse|pg||
pc|hK|nt|henryb:  I was assuming a diamond lead: conceding 2@d but not a heart trick|pg||
pc|h2|nt|daman: I thought South would be the one to double|pg||
nt|dburn: he is, but he is also allowed to play a spade to the jack - indeed, if 3NT had been left to play, that is what he would have done|pg||
