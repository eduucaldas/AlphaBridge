nt|royhughes: Hi everyone|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dinos1: Cornelia :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|dinos1: with soft values and strong short suits better not ask majors|pg||
nt|chick: 9 tricks available after knocking out a couple of aces, and NS have no long suit to set up|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Prakash|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hi Cam and specs|pg||
nt|gambit: One might expect N/S to swing a little, down by 50....maybe we will see some fireworks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness explaining their methods: open lowest with more than 1 4-card suit|pg||
nt|jtr: North can duck 2 @ss to worry declarer|pg||
nt|jtr: But 9 always|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: hi everyone|pg||
nt|chick: HI John :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: hi John|pg||

nt|sybarra: clubs come tumbling home  |pg||
nt|jbgood: hi |pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: This will be on lead..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness: how many spades? six spades|pg||
nt|jtr: un everything it seems|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dinos1: 3@h and 2x3 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: and @H k marked  |pg||
nt|jtr: Nice duck anyway  9 for technical merit|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jtr: oh unducked?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dinos1: now low @d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sadek finally turns the trick, still thinking|pg||
nt|gambit: I was on VuG last night when E/W played very well and knocked off the  1 seed Nickel, they are very tough |pg||
nt|rodal f: 17 -32 aint up but score after 1 segment: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm|pg||
nt|sybarra: apparently unducked |pg||
nt|jtr: reducked|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sunsamvar: what else can south lead? maybe he can try @CA|pg||
nt|sybarra: or redacted as the case may be |pg||
pc|s3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|xenya: great bid by Helness -- 4@S stands no chance|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Christer Kristoffersen and Martin Johnson|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Vugraphzfe: NS carding upside-down|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good day folks|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: hello to both :)|pg||
nt|stoffers: hi all|pg||
nt|jtr: Welcome Martin and Christer|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sry, asked players to not shield cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: and these 4 should know that |pg||
pc|c5|nt|jtr: one sometimes forgets|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dburn: well, collecting that third heart may be problematic|pg||
nt|dinos1: dcl may set @d now|pg||
nt|chick: now that he used up his @D entry, will have to play on diamonds instead|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: I am not sure, but I think that "she" may be the right pronoun for this declarer|pg||
nt|dinos1: now needs to guess|pg||
nt|chick: so I'm being told :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: yes, it's Carolyn Lynch|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|chick: thanks :)|pg||
mc|10|nt|Vugraphzfe: so strange having bandwidth and players not rushing to beat the clock|pg||
nt|jtr: Elemnts there for a double squeeze but the count is not corrected|pg||
pg||

nt|bjacobs: Which is that the Vanderbilt is essentially a stronger event than any of the world championships (except maybe the open Rosenblum Cup)|pg||
nt|gambit: I looked it up this morning, our finalists are from the original seeding  11 (Fleisher),12 (Strul), 15 (De Knijft) and 16 (Zimmerman)  great job to advance to the round of 4 |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: hi all|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: both matches playing the same boards -- if you want to spy try http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   [one window per table]|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: hello everybody|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Hi all|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: World Championships being restricted by country and/or zone|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Fleisher +65 vs Diamond and de Knijff +46 vs Zaleski. Lynch has withdrawn against Strul|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikael_w: In the open room w missed the lead in 3 @s and lead a @s, with a red lead its not posible to make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@S has some chances if you can set up @C in time|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3@s is = if switch to @h after scoring 2 @d's|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 2@D = 11-15, 5@D+4@C  or 6+@D,|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: That 2@s  bid really slowed down W |pg||
pc|s5|nt|mrdct: looks like a push to start with|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|bjacobs: For your interest, see http://www.acbl.org/nabc/rosters/2010/01/VANDPRS/ for the entries|pg||
nt|ady: little problem    9 easy tricks  and 10  if taking heart finesse|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: standard signals n-s|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|dinos1: y, same opening lead in OR|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: now worse|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: And the first swing of the set, Zimmermann extending their lead|pg||

pc|s3|pc|d5|pg||

nt|fabsayc: but 3nt was beatable|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|gambit: doesn't clear the spades to preserve communication and E won't finesse in hearts |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: may not risk heart finesse|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d8|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cT|mc|11|nt|ady: now 11|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: EW defensive carding is standard count but upside-down attitude|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Fleisher +65 vs Diamond and de Knijff +46 vs Zaleski. Lynch has withdrawn against Strul|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: halftime: fleisher 142-diamond 42, de kniff 111-zaleski 56|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Roland and Vladimir|pg||
nt|panja: Usually, the third seat preempt is 'wide range' and is expected to bother opps..but here, it likely helped them|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: walid: what was your shape?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|dburn: seemed better to pitch a club on the third heart, then play a spade|pg||
mb|1H|nt|dinos1: better to play @s to J and set 5th @d|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thxto Wayne:) Here u are the score after segment 2: http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2010/01/vanderbilt/|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: strul 151-lynch 51, and zimmermann 96-onstott 41|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: er, strul 131-lynch 51|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last night we tried something with one commentator seeing only 1 hand|pg||
nt|stoffers: EW dont want to get to high in @d here|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|jtr: Oh?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|gambit: Huge lead for Strul, hopefully this match will become a little closer, adds to the flavour |pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: 100% line coz def didnt lead @c to that moment|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: this is a fair slam, but again the play is not straightforward|pg||
nt|dburn: and nor is the bidding - not quite sure what Passell intends here|pg||
nt|jtr: Might pass even facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|jtr: He did|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am now sitting east, will try not to seem too stupid|pg||
nt|jtr: Hellness considering 2@d|pg||
nt|jtr: And Martin i guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1nt looks normal with the scattered cards|pg||
nt|stoffers: yes, but he also knows south has short @d and Geir didnt run so cant be that good|pg||
nt|jtr: I think he will pass eventually|pg||
nt|jtr: We just have to live long enough to see it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: nobody really knows here but i trust partner and pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: could his pard only have 3 @D? |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: no doubt 4@d is Blackwood for clubs, but...|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@d was? @crkcb?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: I will forward any explanations I can read or overhear|pg||
nt|dburn: ...that seems a little odd with no control in either of the unbid suits|pg||
nt|chick: I'm told by a spec that it is a transfer to hearts, not sure if that is true or not :)|pg||
nt|stoffers: no, 4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no, 4 card majors|pg||
nt|jtr: Voila as they say in Canada|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Vugraphzfe: NS play 1@C could be 2 if 4432, so 1@D is always real diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: no, e/w open 4 card suits or better|pg||
nt|sybarra: and poor Becker can not even lead a @D |pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is terrifying|pg||
nt|stoffers: 3@s NS in open i hear|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok just checking did not have cc up |pg||
nt|stoffers: 1@d-1NT-2@d majors|pg||
nt|stoffers: isntead of double|pg||
nt|stoffers: well, how will 1NTx do folks?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you folks are telling me the diamonds are a dead end, but dont see anything else to try|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: e/w west also open lower of 4 card suits ie 1H with 4 s's and 4h's|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn: well, North will be confident at this point|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: twas passell thinking there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness quits fidgeting with his pencil and leans over the table to examine dummy|pg||
nt|gambit: the lead looks terrifying from W perspective|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps i should cash hearts first |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dburn: whether confident enough to double, we will discover|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: el ahmady in a hurry to push the tray after !4C; helness slows him down and alerts.  writing explanations on both sides of screen|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dinos1: 1@c was strong so ...|pg||
nt|stewball: attack|pg||
pc|s8|nt|warrens:  Becker's too wise to double.  if they ran, his partner would have to guess what suit to lead against 7@C|pg||
nt|stewball: very curious|pg||
nt|dburn: he cannot be sure of beating 7@c, so he will probably let it go|pg||
nt|dinos1: if dbl 6N then 7@c by E and what to lead? :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|panja: 2Nt is BAL or short H....if BAL, Helgemo has reason to think @H contract will be better..|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|jtr: Passive seems best|pg||
pc|hT|nt|panja: not the best lead..trump would have restricted to 4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 4@C = cue bid; 4@S = short @H|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jtr: Both getting somewhat active|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chick: any old A will do :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now spade|pg||
pc|d5|nt|stoffers: im guessing -1 at this point|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure he can time everything out here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gambit: now the clubs|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club back i am down 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: club block could have been fatal|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south has spade jack entry but i guess i can play for north to have it for endplay|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gambit: claiming soon |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||
nt|sybarra: spade if he can see it |pg||
nt|sybarra: but all the tricks go to defense |pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe the @c switch worked out ok|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s4|nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|sybarra: somedays it just all goes wrong |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont understand this play|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h6|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Vugraphzfe: cashes @S @S @C @C|pg||
nt|panja: so the last bid applied breaks on W's aspirations..till then, he must have been thinking of a slam..|pg||

nt|gambit: sounds like a present - is she gift-wrapped?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 2+@C|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mikael_w: there is a big chanse this match will be a real thriller all the way to the end|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: look like 1NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Marty writing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: now alerting one diamond|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fredin-Fallenius 1@D open = 4+ unbal  [or 3rd seat lead director]|pg||
nt|ady: with QJX clubs onside  n/s can make 3NT|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bjacobs: This looks like a simple 4@S, with the trump lead holding down the overtricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: south's 2@D bid will shut west up|pg||
nt|dinos1: and needs to crash @sK|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 3 NT is makeble, but not the best kontract from start :)|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ady: 50's|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room Weinstein in East playing 1NX|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: a 4-2 fit, blown out of the 4-4 by the overcall |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: does this qualify as automatic trump lead auction|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@C will probably end the auction|pg||
nt|chick: 3N may make but declarer will be sweating the whole time :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bjacobs: On this auction, I think the trump is strongly suggested|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't ask Bill|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Trump is mandatory|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You have diamonds sitting over East ...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i was asking Bill|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I lead a trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bill never lead trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: leds or led|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bjacobs: I am so misunderstood :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: declarer will get a good read on the layout when he goes to ruff a couple of @Hs|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room East did not bid diamonds, so he got that lead|pg||
nt|dinos1: now @c to Q?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: They are playing 2 @d in open room, so there will be some IMP to Fleisher this board and posible new leaders|pg||
nt|chick: 2@D which direction? :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: good q :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: Trump lead will hold it|pg||
nt|mikael_w: n/s I was told :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
nt|ady: 1NTX no picnic|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: leads middle of hand|pg||
nt|mikael_w: if it was e/w it might be a push :)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|bjacobs: Declarer is VERY nervous.  After that lead, it seems he needs clubs 3-3|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|s9|nt|gambit: N sure to be endplayed (in NT) a couple times.....tough to get out of the way |pg||
nt|ahollan1: without interference Fallenius 2@C shows 6-11 with @C & @D  -- not sure if that applied after 1@D overcall|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: i have lost the play|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: tossed @s7, @c7 onto table and claimed the rest|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade AJx with north was only chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: irritation showing|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: no 2NT this time|pg||
nt|stoffers: didnt matter, but looked strange.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|dinos1: not a good start for EW in this segment|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 1@D not alerted by Passell but Strul shows two fingers and Passell nods|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bergen raise|pg||
nt|jtr: Shitty opening in that position|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: a desperate S will bid 4, a disciplined one  - not so sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes north could cash diamond and south pitch the spade loser|pg||
nt|sybarra: "any 11"  ?|pg||
nt|stoffers: 3@d promises 4@c + and opening values|pg||
nt|jtr: No pips 2nd at red and no rebid|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|panja: on E's rather..|pg||
nt|jtr: Apart from that it is fine|pg||
nt|stoffers: 4@s??|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could getted X'd |pg||
nt|jtr: 5@c?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should be 55 in spades and diamonds|pg||
mb|2D|nt|stoffers: did becker think 2@d was majors here|pg||
nt|stoffers: ahh|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double|pg||
nt|sybarra: the doubling will start now |pg||
nt|jtr: Nah:)|pg||
nt|stoffers: if S bids 5@s he will get extremely lucky with that dummy|pg||
nt|jtr: Why didnt he open?|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: Linda darling!!!!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Helness and Helgemo are that stabil that NS don't even think abough 4@H|pg||
nt|lml: hey Harmon |pg||
nt|gambit: what a balance!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: immediate 3@S, apparently had decided to balance over 3@H while Sadek had the tray|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 6@D makes because of the lucky lie of the red suits|pg||
nt|stoffers: if im having a misunderstanding like that dummy comes 1363 and queens and jacks :)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|dinos1: 2@d - GF checkback|pg||
nt|xenya: on 49, the bidding in OR was entirely different -- S opened 1@C (not 3@C as here) and it was W who preempted with 3@S -- no wonder EW stayed out of game |pg||
mb|3H|nt|dburn: this is not the worst 6@d in the world, and it will make on this lie of cards, but bidding it will be quite a feat|pg||
nt|dinos1: one more minor slam|pg||
nt|dinos1: now 2N - 3@d?|pg||
nt|dburn: especially since up to now, diamonds have not actually been bid at all|pg||
nt|dburn: if East bids 3@d now, they have some sort of chance, but...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: lynch folds her hand, crosses her arms, looks at her cards again|pg||
nt|gambit: double |pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: helness can sniff helgemo's stiff @H on the bidding|pg||
nt|panja: 4@s a nice spot..|pg||
nt|panja: once again trump lead will be the best for defence|pg||
mb|3S|nt|dburn: ...well, she bid it|pg||
nt|panja: Decl will likely take the A, discards, and xruf|pg||
nt|stoffers: is becker alowed to pass this if partner has 5+ 5+ diamonds and spades?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps club king lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: well - W has good hand for pd|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Vugraphzfe: kibitzer asks Passell for permission to sit behind him - normally no one bothers to ask|pg||
nt|dinos1: side aces and KJ in trump suit|pg||
nt|stewball: and a legit @d suit|pg||
nt|dburn: not clear what 3@h is - 4@d would have been clearer to East, but Passell may intend to support diamonds at a later stage|pg||
nt|dinos1: @sJ wd be golden )|pg||
nt|stewball: i think 3@h is a punt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: carolyn still working it out|pg||
nt|dburn: Lynch not clear what it is either - if I were West it would show worry about clubs for 3NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: strul examining EW system card|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3@s now, no?|pg||
nt|dburn: but in any case East seems to have a 3@s bid and let the chips fall|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. Would have payed|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: now 4@c|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: yes, seems to cover all possibilities|pg||
nt|harmon: back to a ht and 4th d|pg||
nt|harmon: oops|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness leans over the table for a closer look at @CK|pg||
nt|gambit: I would too...........|pg||
nt|rodal f: If u take those two payers I put my money at Helness. A teambuilder and a sniffing nose better then the most of us.|pg||
nt|lml: it is an awlward card though|pg||
nt|gambit: Fabulous players, with the nose(s) of a bloodhound|pg||
nt|lml: this is a link for the half time scores http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2010/01/vanderbilt/|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: walid looking around, slightly impatient.  Sadek sitting back in his chair looking calm|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: and helgemo is always stoic|pg||
nt|rodal f: We don't use that type of dogs to much in Norway Cam:)|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|dburn: no doubt Passell intends that as keycard for diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: but I confess that if I were East, the whole thing would be a complete mystery to me|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Vugraphzfe: strul writing a question then puts his pen on top so I can't read|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if East can work it out the final contract will be 6@d, but if she can't, there is the horrid possibility that it might be 4@h|pg||
nt|dinos1: I was await 4@c cue, but 4@h - it's above me|pg||
nt|chick: have to admit, I'd figure W for a lot of hearts right about now|pg||
nt|dinos1: mb it's @d rkcb? :)|pg||
nt|dburn: I ma sure that it is, but East is not sure at all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: the alerted 4@D previously and alerted 4@H here suggest EW are playing kickback over minors|pg||
nt|dinos1: but why E is thinking so long?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: but now that you mention it, I didn't see lynch alert 4@H when the tray came through|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: NS both holding their cards below the table and looking down|pg||
nt|chick: I wonder if they are using the old rule that says cards have to be played on the same day they are dealt?  :)|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a tough position for Carolyn Lynch - the spectators all know what West's bidding means, and so do North, South, West and I|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: kibitzer H. Lall seems to have fallen asleep|pg||
nt|chick: does this count for sominex coup?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sorry I can't get any read from carolyn, behind her shoulder so I can't see her face.  she's sitting very still this whole time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: strul gestures like he can't believe what's going on|pg||
nt|dburn: she may be wondering why, if partner did not bid Blackwood over 3@d,he can bid it over 3@s|pg||
nt|dinos1: better was cue 4@c and let E ask with 4@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: passell: carolyn, you've got to do something.  this is just ridiculous|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Good hand for Blackwood|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: passell explained 4@H was keycard after the final pass|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||

pc|s2|nt|stewball: if 4@h was not clear it shouldnt have been bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: passell said he'd take a walk after this hand|pg||
nt|dburn: Lynch may be suggesting a long walk, preferably off a short pier|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ady: n/s bouncing may well have kept e/w out of a non making game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Weinstein got out for down 1 in 1NX so board 2 was a push|pg||
nt|ady: oh   east is still there|pg||
nt|gambit: some balance|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: thank you by Bjorn|pg||
nt|ady: East optimistic when partner could take no action after 2@D opening|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3N is makeable only coz of @c lay and @dA location|pg||
nt|mrdct: with north likely to be very distributional having rebid @H, east will not count on his @CAK standing up|pg||
nt|mikael_w: now N has show 6-5 in red I asume|pg||
mb|5D|nt|fabsayc: cold but declarer does not know it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Henry Lortz|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: 5@d? cd N have @sA @hA @dAK?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: there are 8 tricks  n/s may have problems on the run of the clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Fallenius needs North to hold @HK9 or Q9 to make -- anybody see other play for  9?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: yes 12 is possible|pg||
nt|hlortz: hi all from seattle |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bill must be feeling lonely, he is 18 hours ahead of Martin and Henry|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a very respectable 5 pm here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't quite understand why this is being played in the dead of night in the USA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes, Saturday|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this seems the indicated line to me|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there is no night and day in Vegas|pg||
nt|hlortz: or reno|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: casinos open continuously|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree Bill. They could perhaps have started earlier than 1 pm (13.00)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But there is probably a logical explanation|pg||
nt|mrdct: i guess so|pg||
nt|mikael_w: atleast a sugestion|pg||
nt|dinos1: why not S bid 3N/2@h?|pg||
nt|chick: N could have AAAK but that is the about the only reasonable holding that makes a slam|pg||
nt|dinos1: but N is unlimited|pg||
nt|chick: who was it that said, "if you need a specific hand from me, I don't have it"?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: was 3 diamonds forcing  --- yes |pg||
nt|mikael_w: and with that hand N still have a chanse to deside over 5 @d|pg||
nt|ady: you want South to bid 3NT after 2@H sergey?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: chip talking to himself that this will likely go down|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|c5|nt|gambit: misdefence? :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: no, I wd bid 4N as INV to 6@d|pg||

nt|dinos1: w/o side cue|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|mrdct: needs 4-3 @H now|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when playing at casinos which are some distance apart, all the bridge players tend to eat at the tournament hotel|pg||
nt|hlortz: this is the sort of quiet - make game - hand that you like to see when you are 60 ahead :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: which causes a huge rush and long waits|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|dinos1: but for majority 4N is always blkwd|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: so they have extra long breaks for dinner|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: Money from America i guess|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rodal f: Might wrong to say by me but shitt.  Helgemo went angry at Helness when Helness told Helgemo what to do. Didn't play for a while but the youngster opened the eyes.|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Unless a club is lead there is no play|pg||

nt|fabsayc: what are my methods here :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: Or a trump lead, but West has none|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: may be a good time to open a strong no trump as a pre-empt|pg||
nt|panja: B52, EW seem to have 11 tricks..|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: helness coughing and sniffling this set|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: with no chance for 12 i think|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Vugraphzfe: becker asks 4th best or odd, passell says 4th, becker says EW card says different|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, with transfer responses you can bid 3@c natural with some methods|pg||
nt|stoffers: im surprised helness didnt bid 3@c then 3NT showing a slamtry in @c here|pg||
nt|jtr: Like mine:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3s was my choice, club fit with transfer rebids|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: it happens to work here may not on some other hands|pg||

nt|bjacobs: too fast|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|dinos1: length of @h in S hand is unclear - so cant bid higher|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, this was a "normal" sequence following the slightly abnormal 1NT opening|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: becker: sorry didn't see that|pg||
nt|panja: on this lead..it should be easy for NS to restrict E to 11 tricks..|pg||

nt|royhughes: It's not being played like this, I guess -- we are just getting caught up|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|lml: declarer can see eight tricks but not quite sure of 9 yet|pg||
nt|gambit: spade and pray, however, unanswered|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: walid straightening his played tricks, resting chin in hand, elbow on the table|pg||
nt|lml: we know the clubs are working and declarer will shortly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sighs and hunches forward|pg||
nt|gambit: bullet proof |pg||
nt|lml: meanwhile North is trying to think of any lie of the cards that is helpful for the defense|pg||

nt|bjacobs: which the operator is about to discover when he tries to lead|pg||
nt|royhughes: I'm sure things will get back to normal before too long|pg||

mb|p|nt|mrdct: or ruff a @H! if you aren.t in NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 1 club alert|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+  [2@C would cover 20-21 BAL]|pg||
nt|gambit: poor S squeezed with his whopping 3 count |pg||
mb|1C|nt|mrdct: undo that - need the squeeze|pg||
nt|gambit: both so balanced, not surprised to see 3NT (or more NT) as the final contract|pg||
nt|mrdct: obviously i just got of bed - in 6@C you can of course pitch a @D on a @H and ruff a @D provide trumps behave|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+@S    1N=17-19 BAL     eventually|pg||
nt|mikael_w: all these 4-3-3-3 hands :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: easy 6@D, but will they find it missing so many trump honors?|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|ahollan1: aha   Fallenius   2N = a) NAT FG  b) PRE @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|mrdct: it will be difficult to get to 6@C with only an 8 card fit and two balanced hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 3nt in other room|pg||
nt|mrdct: @CAKJ are worthless as it happens|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and its not 100% sure if you make 6 @d, no chanse to play @d to K ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: ? what is 2 diamonds   ------ natural|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: I can make 3NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wonder why he chose that route instead of 1@H response :(|pg||
nt|gambit: well this one no page turner in 3 |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Marty thinking|pg||
nt|mrdct: the squeeze in NT is an interesting one in that it will operate against either opponent|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: This is quite like a hand from the 2nd set ...|pg||
nt|ady: dont think 6@D can be made without a club lead|pg||
nt|mrdct: perhaps not quite worthless, but some red picture cards woudl eb lot more useful|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and you only have 1 entry to dummy|pg||
nt|mikael_w: so I guess 6 @d is close to ded|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hlortz: 3n rebid showing long solid @C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: classic trick taking 3nt rebid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It seems rather strong for this action|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Helgeness had a long auction with the same result|pg||
nt|dinos1: 2@s - shows stopper?|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: as responder you better pull if you cant stop your own bid suit|pg||
nt|chick: well, I spoke too quickly anyway, there is an entry problem to finesse diamonds twice, if no @C lead|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p!|nt|Walddk2: I like Helgemo's 2@D reverse better. The hand is too good for 3NT in my opinion|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, I have a fealing this is not a good board to disturb in the bidding for E/W, this migt stop n/s to bid 6 @d to|pg||

nt|dinos1: result of @c cue - always dangerous|pg||
mb|6D|nt|Vugraphzfd: rusinow lead s t or shortness|pg||
nt|mrdct: so now cash top 3 @H and run the last 2 rounds of  @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hlortz: yes. rather too much for a direct 3n.. this will make 6 on the @D lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: well at least he did not pass:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: still a good slam to bid, just unlucky lie of trump|pg||

nt|dinos1: why show same values twice? :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: exactly|pg||

nt|mikael_w: well, S actually KNOWS W has 6-5 becuse of E preferens 2 @h|pg||
nt|dinos1: cash @cAK  -and ruff what?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: witch also means that he might play on @d 3-0, then he MUST take the @h finess to have a chanse|pg||

nt|royhughes: To any confused observers, we are just getting over some technical problems and getting caught up in the match|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jtr: Strong pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Passell was only 1 point short, have seen 1N on that HCP many times (although this one didn't have much worth upgrading)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: becker always holds his cards below the table, looking down with his glasses halfway down his nose|pg||
nt|panja: possibly, this was good discarding then...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: N/E discussing play in 6@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness: you have trouble in discarding|pg||
nt|panja: 25 HCP with NS... 3Nt might not make though..|pg||

nt|harmon: sweet innocent me??|pg||
nt|harmon: no reason for N to bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: this treatment was popular yesterday, rebidding 1NT with only one of partner's spades|pg||
nt|panja: S reluctant to rebid 1N because of inadequate @D control?|pg||
nt|panja: it would be interesting to guess the lead.....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: walid sits straight up and clasps his hands above his head|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: reaches for box and recoils like he'd touched hot metal|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gambit: you may be sweet harmon, but innocent? Don't think so ...but we love you so|pg||
nt|panja: has to be 3@S now..|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: I wd lead a @D from the east hand against 3 nt|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: why not 3 nt ?|pg||

pc|h4|nt|rodal f: Often nice to have a borderline Linda and Harmon:)|pg||
nt|harmon: Then theres my buddy rodal...sometimes we can even understand what he says:)|pg||
nt|Cavendish: please welcome RodalF, who is norwegian and perhaps can provide some insight into the wonderfully NATURAL norwegian way of bidding |pg||
nt|lml: Welcome :)|pg||
nt|gambit: if N/S want to make up some ground they need to be a little more active, can't beat these guys playing down the middle |pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: it is refreshing after alerting 1@D as 2+ to have two pairs playing it as 4+|pg||
nt|harmon: this was not the hand for it tho|pg||
nt|panja: @SAKx is good.....but the values in the side suits don't really point to a suit contract...so perhaps S should have preferred a 1nt rebid second time, but as the cards are, 4@S ...|pg||
nt|panja: will do better than 3Nt|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: South was trying to protect his red suit holdings but west will lead a @H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: walid lays down his cards and holds his head in his hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness straightens his passes on the tray|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: now walid sorting his hand|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: it seems walid is holding his head more than the cards :)|pg||
nt|stoffers: this will strugle after @c-@c-@d|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Fleisher-Kamil 2@S opening always 8-12|pg||
nt|mrdct: i.m told 4@H in the other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Mike says michael rosenberg says right hand might make slam wrong go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: if north ends up declaring krekorian will need to find the heart lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: well the trumps are wrong but the @H are well placed:)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: so the 3rd seat 13 count isn't really an aberation|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Chip we try to get NT on lead|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this does NOT look like a funny kontract to play|pg||
nt|mcphee: well W needs to shift to @C or that loser goes away on @D|pg||
nt|dinos1: if lead is honest W has @sK and E - all other honors|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|bjacobs: What about West - should he lead a heart?  I think so, even though it's into declarer's suit|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: North has painted a picture of his singleton or void in hearts|pg||
pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: everything else has zero appeal|pg||

nt|gambit: rather robust compared to his multi 2@D on K10xxxx Q9x Q xxx a couple of hands ago |pg||

pc|s9|nt|mikael_w: Debbie ! Was that discard REALY @cK ?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: 1@C  1@H      1@S    3@C        3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i cant agree with that but 2c was overly delicate|pg||
nt|dinos1: now @c to Q and K :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: @d9 was not the best discard I think. @c3 would be better|pg||
nt|dinos1: dcl always had 2 @d tricks|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I asume E/W plays UDCA as most swedish pairs does|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unfortunately for N-S, Elahmady did not bid 3NT over 3@C. He patterned out with 3@D and that made Sadek bid 3NT|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: 6-1 spade fit plays for 10 tricks    5-3 heart fit does not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so the difference is 2@D is garbage, 2@H/@S are constructive  - and as always 3rd seat is 3rd seat :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Auction not over|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mikael_w: yes, but if dec diddnt discard @d2 now he had chanse to 3 @d tricks|pg||
nt|dinos1: 10? not 7?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mikael_w: opps, I have been thinking its S as dec. But its N :)|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cJ|pg||

nt|mcphee: covers a lot of area|pg||

pc|d3|nt|dinos1: or @hA @hQ)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: Eventually he passed and now the lead from Helgemo ....|pg||
nt|hlortz: this duck turns -300 into -100 perhaps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perilously close to making after that duck|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @H2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't think 300 was possible (realistically), but 200 is now turned into 100|pg||
nt|hlortz: 5@H 1C 1@D ??|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East is not going to cash his @CQ|pg||
nt|hlortz: for the defense no?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes ... and no|pg||
nt|fabsayc: casen's win of second heart should mean he has spots to run suit|pg||
nt|hlortz: lol maybe not but if declarers @H werent vulnerasble he'd just have conceded a @C imho|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so i agree with henry|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, he didn't get close.  You want him to rise @DK, cash @CQ and play a heart ... he didn't even achieve the first step|pg||
nt|hlortz: thx martin it's a rare thing for someone to agree w/ me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i will try to do it again|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The point is that East cannot possibly be sure what the situation is ... this is why he perhaps incorrectly ducked the diamond|pg||
nt|hlortz: well it was very easy for ME from up here :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: very slow here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can be sure|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes the duck was the 'natural' play i agree|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: table slightly behind on time|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He truly cannot be sure.  South COULD have @HQ1096.  It's not certain how West would defend with AJ832|pg||
nt|fabsayc: then casen ducks second heart|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No, no, real life isn't like that|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Casen is not certain whether East has 2 hearts or 3|pg||
nt|hlortz: ok but still imho w would/should duck the @H but i see your point|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You are falling into the trap of double-dummy defending|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Casen told Michael to take his time|pg||
nt|fabsayc: how am i suppose to single dummy, close one eye?|pg||
nt|hlortz: perhaps but IF pard has only 2@H may be impossible to beat... but i agree can be mislead by seeing the cards that west/east cannot|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You said: "he can be sure".  Sorry, but that's inaccurate.  I fall into the same trap myself all the time, know it well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No Martin, but I am sure you know the option of seeing just one hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: dummy left for water|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is no dummy analysis|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mikael_w: a safe !q seems right now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mikael_w: Its to big risk to take the A|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|dinos1: N showed 3@s so has 2@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: fingers on the queen of hearts|pg||
nt|mcphee: he knows only 2@H or 1 with N|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Berteau is shaking his head|pg||
nt|mikael_w: hmmm, that looked strange for sure|pg||
nt|dinos1: @hQ|pg||
nt|mikael_w: actually NO lead now will make 2@s |pg||

nt|jtr: Still, if that is their style who am i to criticise|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sorry, thought it was a rhetorical question :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: I don't bid on the South hand.  I was wondering if Helgemo might bid 2@c and pass any response, which could work out badly on this hand|pg||
mb|2D|nt|dinos1: quick -1|pg||
nt|harmon: now its not lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: perhaps not|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness says "wow!" then laughs|pg||
nt|jbgood: not yet, but fingers have gone asleep|pg||
nt|royhughes: His partner has the worst shape for him for that idea|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But the answer is: no, that hand is a pass|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Some play XX shows 5 clubs|pg||
nt|royhughes: This is a deal that noone really wants to be declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: quite common I think, to use business xx's in this situation|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I would like to have a shot a 2@Cxx is partner has anything|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, and partnerships need to know if pass and xx deny a 4-card major or not|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The 2@C device (planning to pass a response) is well known.  The only ugly hand opposite it is 3=3=2=5 shape, and guess what ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: good pass with a flat 8 points, will be lucky to make 1|pg||
pc|s2|nt|harmon: either a fit showing 3c or 4d would give a chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: Strul has to contain himself here,  they are at limit |pg||
nt|royhughes: inspired, anyway|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dinos1: 5@c and 2A to lose|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: becker lifts a card above the table then lowers it again|pg||
nt|stoffers: should be one off on a @h ruff|pg||
nt|stoffers: 2 i mean|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe one beyond limit |pg||
nt|stoffers: if they can get the K@d aswell :)|pg||
nt|stoffers: k@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: I would suspect neither Becker will count out and drop sK maybe|pg||
nt|royhughes: A kibitzer pointed out that some partnerships then allow West to bid 2@h for a choice in the majors|pg||
nt|royhughes: Not that that is wonderful|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now it's turning into a nightmare for E/W - can they escape to something undoubled?|pg||
nt|royhughes: This was an interesting call by Nunes -- anyone know what it means?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|jbgood: hm.. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: sort takeout-penaltyish|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|lml: I think North might have done more|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: no chance to find out|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well,  lets try 4 @C.....|pg||
nt|fabsayc: helness hoping for spade lead|pg||
pc|d2|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: and he got it |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Ah, I see Fantoni also read it as takeout-penaltyish, and of course, he didn't know what to do|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bjacobs: Classically, it's called an "optional" double.  Basically, the world's worst convention|pg||
nt|jbgood: now Helness's careful pass over 2@c x pays off |pg||
nt|royhughes: There are so many possible situations once everyone starts bidding.  Anyone seen this sequence before, or anything remotely like it?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Not often|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So there is only one solution to auctions you have never seen before|pg||
nt|jbgood: not ever|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Fantoni showed no emotion, deep in thought|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And that is to have firm principles.  |pg||
nt|Walddk3: There is a first time for everything. You were here when it happened; aren't you thrilled?|pg||
nt|royhughes: You are so right|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "We play takeout doubles"  or "We play penalty doubles"|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Surely if 2@Cx showed clubs the double of 2@D must suggest a penalty|pg||
nt|royhughes: Nothing is comfortable for declarer here -- he might lead a spade away from dummy to start trying to ruff in hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Unfortunately, most would disagree with the "surely" Paul ... the rest might be fine|pg||
nt|royhughes: or maybe just play diamonds and let the defense do something|pg||
nt|royhughes: which I think would be my choice|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You know what I find the most interesting and instructive comment on this deal?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  He knows west was prepared for 2@H or 2@S so it must be penalties (mustnt it:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "Fantoni shows no emotion, deep in thought"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That truly is a thought-provoking observation|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Could you match it?|pg||
nt|royhughes: Fantoni has been through many, many difficult situations|pg||
nt|royhughes: This is just one more|pg||
nt|bjacobs: We all have.  But 99.9% of us are thinking about the bidding whilst the first couple of tricks are played :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, it takes a great player to get the most tricks from a tough situation like this|pg||
nt|royhughes: A kibitzer asks what we think of the double of 2@c.  A matter of style, I think|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Getting too many comments to reply to you all please excuse if I miss you|pg||
nt|Walddk3: You still looking at the East hand only, Bill?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No, but on this hand Roland, I would be happy to!|pg||

nt|paulhac:  How many do we think he will go down?|pg||
nt|royhughes: The EW distributions seem to be known, and after the lead, the high cards are pretty much placed, too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: It would appear to me that the scores are reversed in the open and closed rooms and will need to be corrected|pg||
nt|royhughes: But even double dummy this is a difficult deal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: no they are correct|pg||
nt|Walddk3: He will not go down if he doesn't play a card|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I guess it's a possible strategy, Roland|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: well, everyone just realized Fantoni won the trick in dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: I suspect 3 knew it :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  A diamond now might let him off for 300 |pg||
nt|royhughes: A kibitzer asked what Fantoni is thinking -- I would say he has placed most of the cards and is trying to calculate exactly|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think the normal play is the small diamond.  If East gets a ruff, you sort of keep control|pg||
nt|paulhac:  He should be pretty certain that Geir is 4-4-4-1|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: Bit late. Specs to answer. Ain't N at a clear 4@D bid?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|dinos1: @cA and @c back wd make def more clear for S|pg||
nt|dinos1: clear 3@c bid|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Back on the auction, perhaps Fantoni was trapped by his @D10xxx into thinking the double must be for takeout|pg||
nt|royhughes: Fantoni is playing to make some small ruffs|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|jtr: 130 vs 100 in 3@s|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Correct|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A nice 12 count ... maybe|pg||
nt|hlortz: oh fine :) south for me if u wish...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: asking if Marty had the jack of diamonds|pg||
nt|mrdct: personally i'm more like to open a bit light than a bit heavy in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dburn: well, he might get this right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: His hand is better|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and a splendidly judged opening bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+  1@D=4+@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: I guess no Drury as they prefer to open at the two level with "marginal" openers|pg||
nt|ady: no time monitors when the play is slow?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|fabsayc: 1nt|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: I also like 1NT better than double|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make up to 10 tricks in clubs|pg||
mb|r|nt|fabsayc: this double will create a headache|pg||
nt|hlortz: me too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: writing what alert is can't see|pg||
nt|gambit: will find their spades now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS=weak NT, not 4@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: same start in other room|pg||
nt|mikael_w: before we did see n/s in the open room play 2 @d on a 5-1 fit. this time e/w has played 2@d in open room with a 4-2 fit :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: better bid 2@h as garbage?|pg||
nt|mcphee: redble worked out badly for W|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: i hate balanced hand t.o dbls|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bjacobs: Now, do I lead a trump? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now, tell us when you see dummy, Bill|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might deny 3@H too, but i won't put that in writing|pg||
nt|gambit: well, no 4@h and it is a feeble NT |pg||
nt|mrdct: they might have a try at 3NT at this vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Good dummy - this might be tough to beat|pg||
nt|mikael_w: as I been told its up to the players to demand a Time-monitor if they think the other side takes to much time|pg||
nt|dinos1: ok, no X, E bid 2@d. what shd W do?|pg||
nt|mcphee: so this is supposed to be pick ?|pg||
nt|chick: http://fribourg.com.ar/bridge/galerie%20des%20Champions/bertheau.jpg|pg||
nt|mcphee: well I assume W was going to bid 2@H over 2@D|pg||
nt|mcphee: seems a bit much to hope partner holds @D length|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think so to, but its prob pass he is thinking about|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mrdct: NS can probably only make 8 tricks in @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dinos1: XX is rather 5@c, no?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Berteau is explaining to Martel|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: EW 8 in NT |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: upside down carding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and it would be a pretty defense to see too Dave -- but @DQ won't get it done|pg||
nt|gambit: looks like a nice lead for declarer, imagining the J with W.....|pg||
nt|ady: this should fail by 1 or 2 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: specific defense for down 2   @H, @H, @H ruff with 10, @CA @H to score @SK|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bjacobs: You're bored as dummy, right Henry?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No he is not|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He said he would be South|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can declarer's hand also|pg||
nt|bjacobs: oh|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *see|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Actually, this is a pretty good feature for specs.  Take Helgemo's seat, ignore the commentary, and "play along" with him|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So Bill, can you beat it or not?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mikael_w: well, I dont think this kontract will make, but better result then in 2@d shod be 100%|pg||
nt|dinos1: long pause then 2@d creates problem with UI|pg||
nt|mcphee: 2@H is no success anyway|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bjacobs: Well, I'm going to give a ruff, and then sort of give up :)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: oops   there is also @D loser    I missed that :(|pg||
nt|po-s: clearly better than 2D|pg||

nt|mcphee: not so sure|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: Close to the truth|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: none of the matches was close after 3/4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3s was beatable|pg||
nt|jtr: yes 2 as i said|pg||
nt|jtr: or maybe 1 actually|pg||
nt|royhughes: This might be a weak 2@d for some partnerships, but Fantoni and Nunes play very different 2-bids|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Italians are discussing interpretations of bids given during auction|pg||
nt|royhughes: It is one reason they are so much fun to watch|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: director being called|pg||
nt|royhughes: When they play faster than last hand, I mean|pg||
nt|royhughes: Just when we thought the deal was over!|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Wonder if the pass of 2@C was alerted on both sides of the table?|pg||
nt|royhughes: What language do the players use for explanations?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: discussion is based on whether pass of dbl 2c can have 4 card major|pg||
nt|Walddk3: English|pg||
nt|jbgood: they play 2@d at the other table.. after 1 NT - p - 2 @c - dbl - 2 @d all pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: initial explanation to Fantoni was that pass denied club stopper|pg||
nt|royhughes: That's a strange action, 2@d|pg||
nt|jbgood: denying majors:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: board will be reviewed by directors, moving on|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|lml: one way or the other 4@H was not the right bid|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2N|nt|Vugraphzfe: I gather Walid was not hoping for 4@H to float|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: de Knijff +46 and fleisher +65.  lynch withdrew against strul|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i like double|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: Mike knows ..his hand is bad for partner|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard might have bid spades,  perhaps now lost |pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|stoffers: i would like a @d on beckers hand after 2@c here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: problem with 2c is i have no idea whether to proceed now|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 3Nt should make here..|pg||
nt|stoffers: a double, not a @d :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: was hoping to get dbled in 5 or 6 assuming they had sp fit|pg||
nt|lml: certainly it was possible that east-west would come back in|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It seems they might have a good shot at an adjustment|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jtr: At least they have the capability to stop after opening these crap hands|pg||
nt|jtr: But here 3NT would make rather hairily|pg||
nt|royhughes: Helgemo buys a spade suit this time!|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|dinos1: low @s - make|pg||
nt|dinos1: @sQ - necessary entry for 2 @d fins|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|panja: simply because the long @S hand does not have a @D honour..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: I am told Steve Landen/Nick L'Ecuyer won the Silodor and that Linda Lewis/Susie Burger won the women's pairs|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sunsamvar: hopefully the semifinals will be more closely faught|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helgemo: 3rd/5th|pg||

nt|panja: what next? @H or @C small?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sunsamvar: what is ur opinion of leading 3/5th in NT pRAKASH ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness: a diamond, you say?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: then sets his card down and clasps his hands to think|pg||
nt|panja: 3rd cad is often too high...|pg||
pc|c8|nt|panja: card even..|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jtr: Meanwhile, 3@c has problems too|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart king best|pg||

nt|sybarra: not sure its easy to put @H K on table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: as the cards|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|harmon: good lead counteract that with AJ of s|pg||
nt|rodal f: At a partscore u often play trumh. Would the same happen at 4@H?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lml: so the @hj is an entry|pg||
nt|panja: a @S..W must overtake if ducked|pg||

nt|stoffers: Hi Paul|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond to queen now, but not confidently|pg||
nt|jtr: Hi Paul|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Helness asks about carding|pg||
nt|jtr: Remember, North made a bid and South declined to make one|pg||
nt|jtr: Odds are @dK with shortage in North|pg||
nt|jtr: He might try the 10|pg||
nt|reisig: These are the hands ...when it's nice to be a spec|pg||
nt|jtr: But slow|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

nt|gambit: 3|pg||
nt|rodal f: Davidal told that same lead came at 4@H when Berthau played it home|pg||
nt|lml: he is going to lose a heart and a diamond (or club)|pg||
nt|lml: besides the spade|pg||
nt|lml: thats all there is|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: walid shakes his head when asked to discard @D|pg||
nt|panja: that's it...cannot be beater now|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, that would have been a killer but hard to find...|pg||
nt|xenya: even for Helgemo|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: room full of vacant chairs but some kibitzers standing for a better view|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: NOT so tough as he knows P has only 3 @S and he has no entry|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what is East plays @H10 now|pg||
nt|panja: I think he would have worked it out had the match been a little more tight...I guess he isn't playing full throttle so to say, to conserve energy?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: true Prakash|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|panja: the @D play might make W think S holds the @CK, that is also another factor|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|jtr: There|pg||
nt|jtr: Running the10 was better i am sorry to say|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|jbgood: might have been a bit more competition - S plays well in @ds|pg||

nt|jtr: Ruff and a @h yes|pg||

pc|dT|nt|lml: you cant want to be in 4 in that one!|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|gambit: So bridge players drop their kids off and go play? Hmmm.....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: lol|pg||
nt|ady: should east become declarer in 3NT   might scramble 9 tricks if guessing Q@C  on an end play |pg||
nt|mrdct: i don't think 3NT will play very well|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Bjorn leaning in and playing with his hair|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H lead, triple hook @D, find @CQ  3N cold :)|pg||
nt|gambit: W looks more like a weak NT than "unbalanced". That you are after a case of Bud at a tailgate party in new Orleans |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: lots of talking between Marty and Peter|pg||
nt|mrdct: however, with a correct guess in @C you do have 8 tricks and a 9th make come if douth leads a @S or a long @D can get setup - problem for the defence is north never gets in to lead ...|pg||
nt|mrdct: the @SQ through|pg||
nt|mcphee: Nystrom thot he just had this hand:)|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3@d vs 3@s|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: 15 to 16 NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: wonder if 3@S would be NAT or partial @H stop|pg||
nt|ady: as they lay  if he guesses Q@C    the heart finesse is marked  and likely 6 hearts witth north  so South can be end played in diamonds to give a spade trick|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW will struggle to go plus on this board now|pg||

nt|rodal f: Belive Harmon agree with u Cam.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness yawns again.  I wonder if these players suffer from jet lag, 9+ hours behind their home time zone|pg||
nt|lml: I think a heart lead will prevent 6NT|pg||
nt|gambit: of course South might have cause to imagine his partner's diamonds to be MUCH better|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Vugraphzfe: walid stops examining his hand and leans forward to examine dummy more closely|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Bit more play here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dinos1: now @c - then =|pg||
nt|lml: but that will be the normal lead|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dinos1: this is +2|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|lml: yes you are all right.  Anything but a heart it can be made on a double squeeze|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: starting with round of 16 the vanderbilt is played with screens which run diagonally across the table so players cannot see their partners mannerisms|pg||
nt|gambit: tempting to try, thaat 4D bid was sedductive, let's see if he can resist|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: during the auction the boards are passed back and forth through a curtain.  after the auction a window is opened so all players can see one another's played cards and the dummy|pg||
nt|harmon: not i cant as lomg as E retains Jxx of hts|pg||
nt|dinos1: wonder - at all 4 tables 4@h+3 was played (b.38)|pg||
nt|gambit: Imagine Akxxxx xx Akx xx |pg||
nt|lml: I think that South should discount the @CQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sadek still contemplating his next call|pg||
nt|rodal f: Just for fun. If N had 3@H and single @C by a 6NTS|pg||
nt|gambit: and the 4@D call, that was inflammatory |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness clears his throat for the hundredth time and riffles his cards.  seems impatient|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helgemo looks like he could sit in that posture forever|pg||
nt|rodal f: There way to be John:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: one arm across his chest, other elbow on his wrist, scratching his chin|pg||
nt|lml: the way you have to make it in 6NT assuming no heart lead is actually a kind of strip squeeze|pg||
nt|lml: you have to play a diamond from dummy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Helgemo by the pokerface and Helness the former world champ at poker|pg||
nt|lml: East has to duck|pg||
nt|lml: then you run all your winners and West has to hold three clubs (and therefore two hearts)|pg||
nt|jbgood: needs more than luck to land it I think |pg||
nt|jbgood: a good start though|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lml: you cash the hearts and throw him in|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I wonder if they would have bid 4 vulnerable?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lml: so that is our fairy tale for today|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: the time "limit" is 150 minutes for 16 boards|pg||
nt|harmon: cant east keep Jxx of hts??|pg||
nt|gambit: If Helgemo doubled  - would that say don't lead my suit?|pg||
nt|lml: no because then you dont cash the hearts|pg||
nt|lml: you play club club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: but enforcement is difficult because often both sides are at fault|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|lml: its a five card ending|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: moss-gitelman/fleisher-kamil fell far behind on time in Q1 then rushed to catch up|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: in Q2, lynch-passell took ages for the first few boards, then took a walk to shake off a disaster|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|gambit: note how Ebid his 5 card suit(vs his 6 card suit) and what a wonderful bid it was for his side , wd|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 2nt: "four trumps and game forcing"|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lml: okay you all love squeezes.  Great comments from spec|pg||
nt|gambit: not going to make this |pg||
nt|lml: there is something about a winkle but I dont have time to think about it|pg||
nt|harmon: why??|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|paulhac:  He should be able to raed the club suit and get his spade away but can he ruff 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|royhughes: Right -- 2 rounds of trumps would be too many|pg||
nt|royhughes: Because Helgemo could then ruff a club and play a 3rd trump|pg||
nt|royhughes: So maybe hook a club right away|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: Not?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|harmon: claim 11|pg||

mb|1N|nt|mrdct: 4@S for EW looks reasonable|pg||
nt|gambit: Thx Al|pg||

nt|mrdct: even if to stop NS find a @H fit, i think east should do something here|pg||
nt|gambit: great to have system expert here, Thx to Al Hollander for that |pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: Fleisher if given the room (to show 3H constructive)  will|pg||
nt|mrdct: but non vul opposite a 10-13 limited opener and only a known 6-2 fit game doesn't appear too likely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S blocking|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This is a lot more interesting than the usual commentary, says a spectator|pg||
nt|hlortz: thats the fascination of the game even world class players cant play double dummy... 'errors' are prevalent|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did I open a can of worms I wonder|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Maybe "I" should have opened 2@D (they play weak 2s in diamonds, i think)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Too wild, perhaps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might lose a lot of commentators if the spectators demand we use only one eye|pg||
nt|gambit: double now?|pg||

pc|s5|nt|dinos1: now no guess|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: taking a small break|pg||
nt|gambit: going to check on the kids in the room next door?|pg||
nt|mrdct: this will be a timely board for dekniff as it's been one-way traffic so far|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: player|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: well @H made 10 tricks in the closed room - so some hope for fleisher here|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: y a spade was led|pg||

nt|paulhac:  Both of these pairs will be playing for Europe in the Buffett Cup in September|pg||
nt|royhughes: Something is wrong here -- if 2@s was a limit raise in clubs, doesn't West bid more?|pg||
nt|jbgood: No NT by Helgemo?|pg||
nt|royhughes: There isn't a partscore of 40!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hard to believe this auction|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Phillip?  They are playing a pathetic 3@C contract?|pg||
nt|jbgood: some system misunderstanding for sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: yes and Helgemo doesn't look happy|pg||
nt|jbgood: so 2@s was meant as a preempt in @cs?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: If nothing else, it's good for the match|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: lots of writing|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: maybe he wants to show short spades?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be 3@s giving shortness in @h to not give the possibility to dbl at opps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe they use steps for shortness|pg||
nt|mrdct: fredin having vague thoughts of a slam in @C?|pg||

mb|3C|nt|gambit: Bjorn, 3NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: that incline must be one heck of a tilt|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Except maybe this one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @D10 is an entry :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gambit: was W's pass forcing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: if West can't reopen impossible to have 12 tricks - right bid 3NT|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@H is probably quite a good save for NS|pg||
nt|gambit: 10 toppers|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: As Pierre Schmidt points out, West will have to give the entry later anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: how did 4@S go down 2 in closed room|pg||

mb|2H|nt|stoffers: 3@d now?|pg||
nt|jtr: Just about|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: so it was 3 NT all the way - quite a few kibs almost had a heart attack..|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: clock on 72, plenty of time|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: kibitzer walks through wearing a lei.  today is hawaii day: hawaii is part of host District 20|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well if declarer played @H instead of @C he would still ruff the 4th @D high and go 2 down|pg||
nt|jtr: If 2@d was forcing he may try 3NT|pg||
nt|reisig: 3N in all cases|pg||
mb|2N|nt|royhughes: Interesting that Fantoni did not bid with short hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: yes :) operator erred|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: then plays immediately to trick 1|pg||

nt|stoffers: again i must say|pg||
pc|sA|nt|reisig: A "normal" spot|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: well done by NS -- perhaps E's double helped a bit|pg||
nt|panja: but the third seat preempt has put a high friction surface under the auction..|pg||
nt|panja: third seat opening..rather|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Vugraphzfe: yes claimed at trick 1|pg||
nt|xenya: it allowed S to show first-round control in @Ds early|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|dburn: not ridiculous for East to have bid 2@d at some stage - better that than have partner lead a heart or a club against 1NT|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think I would, yes.  I suppose it depends also on how active your partner is over 1N|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|h9|nt|dburn: but still, 2@d could go for quite a lot against nothing on the wrong sort of layout|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: it's a bit early Martin :)|pg||

nt|mcphee: we welcome them Cameron|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/Vanderbilt2010/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof8  for 3/4 scores|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: now peter says never mind|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS have to try 3NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: hmm - he had top 11 tricks, why 10?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|Walddk2: This match is obviously also over|pg||
nt|bridge_one: having DBL, 2Nt, 3@c it is sure E/W use different means at each bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: he  Helgemo opened 1@D in 3rd|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: ive noticed helgemo, meckwell seem to play '3rd seat is forcing' rarely except vul vs not do they ever pass...|pg||
nt|ady: maybe playing too fast  lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Son and father have not had the best slam record lately, so ....|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: In Thomas' BBO profile he even reads that he does not want to talk about slams|pg||
nt|mcphee: good lead|pg||
nt|gambit: like "I don't understand how declarer made only five spades. I understand why he wanted to make only five spades:it wouldn't be so obvious he missed a slam." |pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: writes rather|pg||
nt|hlortz: blackwood with a worthless dbltn frowned on in some circles|pg||
pc|d9|nt|gambit: 3NT too greedy without a filler in @d, but it makes the worlk go round and on a beter day the K@D would be on-side|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East will probably lead a minor|pg||
nt|mikael_w: a good lead for n/s, I think 10 tricks was posible without @d lead|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: Thomas is the son|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A trump is safe, but pointless|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'd lead a club myself|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: and what does that do|pg||
nt|hlortz: shouldnt south show the queen with 5 trump?|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Finds partner with @CQ, and some slow entry?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: I think he should, Henry|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after the overcall by West the probability to find K in @d there are greater that in east|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|gambit: "his lead was the middle from the top of nothing." |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hlortz: or did he>  5@S is usualkly the Q|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|Vugraphzfd: almost double you|pg||
nt|mrdct: @C never mentioned or lead in the other room|pg||
nt|gambit: new leader on the scoreboard storming back (i thought Bjorn might double this one too) if they stay, ......|pg||
pc|d6|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|sybarra: ah true |pg||
nt|stoffers: or just take the 2-300 expected|pg||

nt|bjacobs: 2@C = 10-13 with clubs|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|dinos1: 1@h = 8-11 any?|pg||
nt|lml: arent you supposed to have high cards to bid 3@D not just diamonds|pg||
nt|gambit: there is a little hunger, let's hope that N can take a joke|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: think they are headed for hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness points at the bidding cards around the tray|pg||
nt|stoffers: big board here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: sadek lays down dummy out of order saving kings for last|pg||
nt|panja: good lead...not much difference here...a trick in each suit is all EW will get|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if hhe cases his aces then north has a chance|pg||
pc|sK|nt|stoffers: 7@s coming up|pg||
nt|sybarra: which 7 do we want to play? |pg||
pc|sA|nt|royhughes: I'm certainly not criticizing pass, though -- I just thought it was interesting|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Vugraphzfe: both sides playing like they believe the match is out of reach|pg||
nt|stoffers: but...bad splits today, and i guess one off|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness had a long think before choosing @H7|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: there goes the @H loser|pg||
nt|xenya: we KNOW that it is out of reach|pg||
nt|panja: it seems 2@H can be 5 cards...why else would E like to try small @H here?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dinos1: wrong-sided NT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|paulhac:  I am told Fredin did balance so you are not alone:)|pg||
nt|royhughes: Thank you!|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|stewball: wrong sided on a @h lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: becker whispers questions to lynch; passell answers through the closed screen|pg||
nt|dinos1: @s or @h? :)|pg||
nt|stewball: but why shld  lead a @h instead of a @s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: it was five cards earlier - helgemo was 5-5 in the reds|pg||
nt|reisig: 7@s may be -1|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Well bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: lucky as the cards are  7 nt,  but perfer 7 @S at imps|pg||
nt|jtr: Indeed Richie|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|dinos1: @s spots are much better)|pg||
nt|panja: and now, Declarer has enough entries to Dummy to bring in play the long Clubs|pg||
nt|reisig: This lead kills the dbl squeeze too|pg||
nt|jtr: Now that has broken up the double squeeze|pg||
nt|jtr: Touche:)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lml: a hungry double would have worked well|pg||
nt|dinos1: @d10?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness's calls are often 'ya' or just grunts|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|Vugraphzfe: click click click click pff pff pff pff, flipping his played tricks one under the other|pg||
nt|lml: it might be hard to figure out that he should play for the spade ruff|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: or ruff a @D|pg||
nt|xenya: but this hand could produce a double game swing for Onstott -- in theory|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dinos1: now @s back and?|pg||
nt|dinos1: must play @sA|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|stewball: not such a hard play|pg||
nt|dburn: well, first declarer must play a diamond - the @d9 is normal, in case of @dJ10 with North|pg||
nt|dinos1: if duck @s - quick @h switch will beat|pg||
nt|stewball: even a slow @h switch|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: strul rearranges his hand then folds it again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: examines dummy and selects|pg||
nt|lml: good for him|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: @DJ may have pointed the way|pg||
nt|lml: true|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: walid sitting with hands clasped in front of his face|pg||
nt|stoffers: best line here after discovering spades 3-1?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Could North get careless and discard a heart?|pg||
nt|jtr: One down next door|pg||
nt|reisig: NO!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: dont have entries for 2 heart finesses|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Well, he had|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes a trump was led|pg||
nt|Walddk3: But only specs would play it that way|pg||
nt|sybarra: tough to take ht finesse first!|pg||
nt|reisig: Right - Roland :)|pg||
nt|baylind: .|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if one is enough dont need it|pg||
nt|jtr: But he might have cashed @cAk before a second trump maybe?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h5|nt|jtr: Then ruffed a @c|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c6|nt|jtr: Other room i mean|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c7|pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|lml: the problem is that the @S K is vanishing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kibitzers, i see only the east hand|pg||
nt|stoffers: nice J@c|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness pushed @S7 toward Sadek and claimed down 1|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||

mb|1C|nt|fabsayc: but at matchpoints the pointless heart lead avoids the overtrick|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bjacobs: I think that's the correct analysis ... a club would be very dubious at matchpoints|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: yet another 1@C=2+|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here it looks like n/s has a tough 4 @h, but a 300 sac in 5 @d for e/w|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|mrdct: so after trailing 0-17, dekniff have racked up 28 imps in 3 boards|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: So did Helness but ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: different auction, though|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: now i have to scan notes :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: your right, maybe its 500 in 5 @d|pg||

pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|dinos1: better deep one)|pg||

pc|cK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: lots of writin gby fredin|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can make 13 tricks also without finesse in @h|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Vugraphzfd: Bjorn sits up straight in chair|pg||
nt|gambit: can he trade the K@D for the Q@H?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ruffing 2@C and 1@d|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes 7@S looks makable|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but need to play seeing all cards :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 7@S in other room|pg||
nt|mrdct: i doubt this hand will be over before the top of the hour|pg||
nt|gambit: 7@s made there too wd |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 53 minutes on clock|pg||
nt|ady: I think 7 spades likely to go down   |pg||
nt|gambit: Tell that to Levin |pg||
nt|mikael_w: there is a risk that w plays a low @s now|pg||
nt|mcphee: he will need to finesse in @C again to bring this home if they find @D tap|pg||
nt|dinos1: now if def tap dcl with @d's and he tries ruff @c - W will put @h10|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: i'm not positive if exact shape known or just 4@S & 2@H|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrdct: on what line david?|pg||
nt|ady: what line do you make it?|pg||
nt|mrdct: dummy reversal|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 7@S is very hard, but at the table can be made|pg||
nt|chick: W is not listening to you :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: ic :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bridge_one: with lead @s i think he will make|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mrdct: in the other room north bid 1@H which guided the play somewhat|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Peter now sits up|pg||
nt|gambit: No shyness here....|pg||
nt|mikael_w: there was a verry light opening from S. so you have to understand w for thinking @dK is in S hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bjacobs: Seriously, how do you guys play a double of 4@S in that auction?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The 4@S opening, I mean, not the overcall|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|gambit: Will S lead a trump? I think so |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Pete says he has show 4 2 3 4 without Q of clubs|pg||
nt|mrdct: well there's no point leading a singleton to get a ruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Have i shown a maximum?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D lead looks most troublesome  but   is it a reasonable lead?  all depends upon what Fleisher knows about Fredin's shape|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: was told 4 2 3 4|pg||
nt|bridge_one: there are also the chance to play a double squeeze ruffing 2 @H in the dummy|pg||
pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: primarily penalty|pg||
nt|dinos1: well - S has only 10pc so @dK is rather in his hand|pg||

nt|chick: a four-trump double|pg||

nt|mrdct: on the face of it this looks like game in either major for NS - but both majors break 4-1 so it might be tricky|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dinos1: lucky 4@s|pg||
nt|ady: nice lay for 4@S e/w|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: I think 2@H just LR+|pg||
nt|mrdct: with a 10 card @D fit, EW likely to save in 5@D|pg||
nt|mrdct: which is a great save given that it makes|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here 4 @s is even playable|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikael_w: not easy to find in the bidding tho|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|bjacobs: Gazilli reaches the United States!  Excellent|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: might not get to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: in a dubious version, west hand is 2s bid|pg||
nt|dinos1: i wd say impossible)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but they have made it their own by omitting one  z|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mrdct: trump lead best|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: good luck Peter|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gambit: "when indoubt - put the opponents on lead - why should you make the mistake?"|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mr Pedant went to sleep, so I have taken over|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are there 11 tricks?|pg||
nt|gambit: N bid 1@H over 1@c with his x Q9xxx Q9xxx xx, (last hand) - giving a blueprint to the opps, serves them right |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Mike this game is too Hard|pg||
nt|mrdct: they seem very chatty at this table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fleisher @DJxx complicates the play|pg||
nt|gambit: Sometimes I think we fail to appreciate how well these players play, it is a treat to watch |pg||
nt|ady: also doubleton club|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bjacobs: So the idea behind Gazilli is that after 1major 1NT (and other auctions), 2@C is either clubs or a strong hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i assume west actually bid 2d or 2s, not 3@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 3@D was the bid|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's not real Gazzilli then|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Typically, the lowest unbid suit in response shows the top of the 1NT range, and commits to game if opener has the strong hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S would be the bid|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, no idea what 3@D means|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Less than 8, usually 2 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still no @D shift should help Fredin read the hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: south a chance to score his @DJ as an overruff?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: "drawing trumps. I give you the ace of clubs"|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully showing clubs and hts |pg||
nt|stoffers: yes|pg||
nt|paulhac:  It is when his partner has 6 spades that they will get lost after a 2NT bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "sorry partner ... didn't think there was slam in it"|pg||
nt|royhughes: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: lots of laughing that Helgemo should bid more|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|stewball: hang around for autographs|pg||
nt|lml: something interesting needs to happen soon or my eyes are going to close|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: has not been a swingy set, and all matches need swings to get close|pg||
nt|sybarra: makes sense |pg||
mb|1C|nt|gambit: will their flirt with 6@D?|pg||
nt|gambit: smoke gets in your eyes|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|chick: think they will find 6@D?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Interesting overcall by Geir|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think if you are in 4 you might take the diamond finesse and go down|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Mike Lawrence would approve|pg||
nt|bjacobs: (I think)|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: how about 7|pg||
nt|dinos1: 7@d isnt good but 6 is excellent|pg||
mb|1S|nt|warrens:  I think the question is, will they find 7?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: N might compete with 2@S|pg||
nt|stoffers: 1@s or 1NT here folks?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  1NT |pg||
nt|royhughes: Maybe -- he likes to be long in the opened suit|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Vugraphzfe: all tables playing the same boards this round|pg||
nt|panja: 2@D doesn't seem better than a dbl here...but with a 4-4 fit..the bid will do better than 1Nt dbl..|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: e/w found a good spot here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: slow pass from Helgemo, quick pass from El Ahmady|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: 14-16 1NT is ok with me|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If I had to name one bridge book that you should buy in order to improve your game, I think it would be "The Complete Book of Overcalls", by Mike Lawrence|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|dburn: seven probably not with the odds - seems to need two 3-2 breaks|pg||
nt|sybarra: and if play 15-17?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: N/S have not been swinging, perhaps last set will be more active|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: walid asks behind the screen.  helness: could be 5-5.  not 6-4, normally|pg||
nt|stoffers: lol, i got 12 specs answers in 3 seconds, 6 for @s, 6 for 1NT! People really judge differently :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Multon does|pg||
nt|paulhac:  1@S|pg||
nt|stoffers: thats a 5-17 yes sybarra|pg||
mb|2D|nt|dburn: but maybe some 4-1 diamond breaks can be handled|pg||
nt|dinos1: in 7 both mm's shd be 3-2 (or 3@d4@c in 1 hand)|pg||
nt|gambit: LOL, Stewy you make me laugh, and that (as Martha says - is a good thing), I think we forget that it is so easy seeing all hands, these players deserve our praise, they play at the ...|pg||
nt|gambit: top, and btw I did ask Eric Murray, Sami Kehela and Roy Hughes to Autorgraph Roy's book - for me dad. He was thrilled. |pg||
nt|dburn: but the break-even point for a grand slam is around the percentage chance of one 3-2 break (a little over 68%)|pg||
nt|stewball: thats what \i'm here for:)|pg||
nt|dinos1: Strul will continue with 4@c|pg||
nt|paulhac:  This will test Geirs declarer play|pg||
nt|royhughes: Helgemo didn't want this preference!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dinos1: )))|pg||
nt|harmon: 4hts +3 was a push|pg||
nt|jtr: 3NT looks slightly better than 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 6@S isnt terrible|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dburn: so, if you need a 3-2 break plus some handling, you should not be in seven|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: strul has been very composed throughout.  can't read what he's thinking, no indication he was about to take this leap|pg||
mc|8|nt|dinos1: he has strong indication pd has stiff @h|pg||
nt|dburn: unless of course you are GIB, which would make seven without breaking sweat (not that software can sweat, but...)|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Dave always keeping eye on highest priority|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H=game force|pg||
nt|bridge_one: slam in @S is ON - the Q in @C is protected|pg||
nt|ady: n/s may end in 2@H|pg||
mb|1S!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: So it very much looks like Zimmermann vs Strul and de Knijff vs Fleisher in tomorrow's semi-finals|pg||
nt|mrdct: i don't think they'll get anywhere near slam|pg||
nt|ady: poor slam|pg||
nt|mrdct: pretty lucky layout|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes - 4@S is the right contract|pg||
nt|mikael_w: so, 2 or 3 @h looks like the final kontract here|pg||
nt|ady: or 2@C|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|dinos1: 1@s showed @c suit as well?|pg||
nt|ady: east might eventually compete|pg||
nt|dinos1: S wont pass|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: Europe vs USA in both matches|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Is this where I go off at my partner for not trying 2@D?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but calling 6 are made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: paraphrasing Hideous Hog -- you've got to bid poor slams [that make] because so many good ones go down|pg||
nt|mrdct: that's always been my approach|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: leads?  3rd|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3@c? or what?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: opps|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: wow|pg||
nt|ady: oh   higher than I tht|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: this is 1st hand played by North!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mikael_w: looks like 3 down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: chip shrugs shoulders and says thanks|pg||
nt|ady: this looks like -3 on good defence|pg||
nt|dinos1: def has time to open @s suit in time|pg||
nt|gambit: "this is a contract that would be justified only on success, and I have a feeling that it will not be."|pg||
nt|dinos1: for 3N shd have @c suit headed with AQJ at least|pg||
nt|gambit: 2C more fitting |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|dinos1: I wd rebid 3@c/1N|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, 3 @c looks like a good bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: no explaination on king lead|pg||
nt|gambit: W knows the clubs are't running - why take a chance that N has 10xxx in @D?|pg||
nt|ady: maybe spade switch now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 27 min for four boards |pg||
nt|gambit: hopefulyy for the def...|pg||
nt|ady: north should win and grab 6 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: have just added 10 minutes total of 37 min warning to both pairs to play the rest of the boards|pg||
nt|dinos1: depends on meaning of @d signal|pg||
nt|dinos1: but @d5 is unclear))|pg||
nt|dinos1: 5 from 543?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Debbie, we dont get the result from open room ? are they as slow there as they are here ? (if you know )|pg||
nt|dinos1: or Q75?|pg||
nt|ady: dont think west to worried  with his holding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: they are on the same board|pg||
nt|dinos1: W - yes :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Bertheau has hand on his head|pg||
nt|dinos1: poor E :)|pg||
nt|gambit: better tahn his head on a silver platter|pg||
nt|gambit: has to switch |pg||
nt|ady: surely a spade looks right if uncertain of diamond position|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: jack of diamonds in his hand now|pg||
nt|dinos1: switch? and pd has @dQ and no @cA?|pg||
nt|chick: he has to worry that N has the @CA though|pg||
nt|gambit: if pard had Q he should unblock....but didn't for obvious reasons |pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, something is wrong in the bidding when a @h switsh now will result in 2 or 3 down :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: and only 3rd by NS|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: this looks best, then discard spade on club return|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The only question mark is de Knijff (Sweden), but they were 46 up going into the last 16|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: nope 4th :(|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Mike says he is thinking about the whole hand now|pg||

nt|paulhac:   thought Norwegian banks were still solid|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: vanderbilt is about the last place in ACBL where Multi is still allowed|pg||
nt|lml: now how to get to hearts|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lml: yes multi is so fearsome|pg||
nt|lml: we North Americans quake before it|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: tough to believe such a long-standing convention is so dispised by the authorities |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: ladies and gentlemen, this is lightning bridge here|pg||
nt|jbgood: they are - I was more concerned about the American ones|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|gambit: Even though E is clearly a notch or 2 (or 3) down from these players, I think we also have to recognize the pressure, to perform at this level and their successes so far, it is ...|pg||
nt|gambit: easier to criticize that to priase |pg||
nt|dinos1: Lynch team won 25 and 27 boards - 22 imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: becker thinking - but he looks just the same whether it's his turn or not|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: moves his lips slightly as if whispering to himself|pg||
nt|gambit: will he bid 2@H? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: only the second time I recall that he's needed extra time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 62 was played at normal tempo but poor connection wouldn't let me load it promptly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: connection fine again now|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: entry problems in south and west hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness pointed at 1NT card.  Walid showed him the fist that means strong.  Helness, laughing: "we'll see!"|pg||
nt|stoffers: going for a vul game, he had no option. Pass i guess is the only one:)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: In the other semi-final, de Knijff is 11 up against Fleisher|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Lots of Norwegians reassuring me|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|dinos1: after X from E?|pg||
nt|gambit: LOL...3@H? wow|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: strul surprised too to see that card on the tray but quickly finds|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|lml: well you cant reverse 1@S and 1nt over 1 of a minor|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helgemo asks: was 3@C invitational?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness: after pass, I am not sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helgemo: well, we will see|pg||
nt|lml: many strange things in the ACBL convention restrictions|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sadek had asked for an explanation and helgemo had to ask|pg||
nt|stoffers: uh oh|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jtr: South may get interested now|pg||
nt|stoffers: 3@c might get doubled yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: what does E do?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: over 3@C?|pg||
nt|jtr: At MPS he would for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: sadek puts down @C2 by itself.  walid: come on!|pg||
nt|stoffers: but helness can bid 2@h|pg||
nt|stoffers: and did|pg||
nt|jtr: This may escape|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: lynch takes her glasses off again, has had them on then off several times this set|pg||
nt|gambit: nice dummy and better - stiff 10@H|pg||
nt|dinos1: how to play ag @h4-1?|pg||
nt|dinos1: seems @c fin is needed|pg||
nt|gambit: run the 10@S (not saying it is right, but it solves a lot of problems) |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: becker studying his hand, pulling one card then another slightly out of line, planning line of play|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: good lead|pg||
nt|jtr: Prefer double to 2NT though|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I would put my money in Icelandic banks if I were you|pg||
nt|jbgood: put it - or bury it?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jtr: I have probably denied 4@hs so partner can judge|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Did they not just refuse to pay us Brits Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: They did|pg||
pc|h2|nt|stewball: @s T will be covered likely|pg||
nt|gambit: many strange things in ACBL. (period) |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness asks to see the trick again.  "I'm sorry, I am tired"|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|stoffers: i think Helgemo's double is 100% correct, all you specs writing med critisising it are looking at all four hands :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: well if only Becker could see all hands|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|gambit: yes, and declarer might "fall back" on the apparent marked @D finesse |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: lynch's turn to meditate.  clock on 10|pg||
nt|stewball: marked?|pg||
nt|gambit: by the double |pg||
nt|dinos1: now has X-ruff|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gambit: not any more|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulhac:  I agree Christer|pg||
nt|Walddk3: and the Dutch too|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dinos1: now @s fin - then sqz W in @s-@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: handled @H3 but put it back|pg||
nt|sybarra: unfortunately the @D's dont break the way he hopes |pg||
pc|s8|pc|cJ|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No mercy from Helgemo-Helness in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting point is initial DBL -- is it Takeout [of @H] or @H??|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They did very well to penalise 2@C with just five between them, divided 3-2|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bjacobs: They must have ... East doubled the runout ... once again, takeout or penalties?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well at worst they would chalk up -180, so not that risky|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: primarily penalty, very old fashion of me|pg||
nt|bjacobs: dreadfully :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I guess you are 90% sure @CQ is a trick, so as you point out, it's going to be -180 at worst, and with your easy lead, you are quite likely to beat it|pg||
nt|mrdct: barry goren opines, 3@h would have been 100% forcing so 4@h showed a mountain and @s bid KC. No way 4NT can be corrective|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: I don't think Michel's pass is conventional|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It isn't|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after the raise in @s by East the dbl became for all table @h suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: Yes it does, even Tiger doesn't hit a hole in one on all the par threes - mistakes happen, and you have to stay out of the sand traps and water and hit the greens in regulation, ...|pg||
nt|gambit: sometimes you whack it into the forest or the pond. s**t happends and a new leader. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if 2@C=trf @D or like Gazzilli|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt now ?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: sure not gazzilli|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: writing explantion of what is 2clubs but I can not read it from here|pg||
nt|gambit: redouble?|pg||
nt|ady: this an easy 4@S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gambit: This is for the VuGraph commentators: "There are three right plays in bridge - what is correct in analysis, what works and what I would have done."|pg||
nt|mikael_w: guess 2 @h is GF, nice and easy bidding then to show distrub.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: if 2@C is long @D i think 3Nt correxct with AJxx|pg||
nt|gambit: wow! |pg||
mb|2N|nt|bjacobs: These strong notrumps are just too dangeours|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Still, a minor runout is worth considering|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Casen 4th best!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: table chuckled|pg||
nt|janm: 2@d showed either 6 spades or a minimum 5(332) hand, 2@h asked, 2@s showed 6 spades|pg||
nt|dinos1: and what was 2@d?)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Vugraphzfd: more writing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: common treatment when 2@C=2+ and 1@D=4+ UNBAL  is to play transfer rebids by opener|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c redoubled was probably going to make|pg||
nt|gambit: ok, that is better|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dinos1: good contract in MP/BAM|pg||
nt|ady: spade contract a little better|pg||
nt|janm: 2@c was game forcing, but might have longer diamonds|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: The entry to double finesse clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: spade is an entry??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless West ducks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But partner gave me an encouraging spade card at trick 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: @D is an entry too|pg||
nt|hlortz: unless casen plays pard for k108 he ought to duck|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh I see, declarer has AK10 or AQ10 ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: AK10|pg||
nt|hlortz: very good :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: @C Kx on side|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many ask about gazzilli 2@C - the 2@C gazzilli is played only after 1Maj open to give any strong hand or natural 12/16 with @c|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@C by west, therefore, probably wont make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that fits the auction perfectly -- and IS played by Fredin-Fallenius|pg||
nt|dinos1: why better? 3N by N is best|pg||
nt|mikael_w: will @c lead not end up only 630 ?|pg||
nt|ady: spades almost certainly 11 tricks   no-trump might be only 10|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Vugraphzfd: Peter this is bad news but is better not red|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: And next comes a diamond up|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 1@D open the gazzilli isn't used - here 2@c have for sure a means, but i don't think similar at gazzilli layout|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bjacobs: Now I'm totally lost.  Declarer won @SA?  I guess I'm tired.  64 boards in a day ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: was perfectly safe, Bill|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Last chance to beat it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Specs tell me I am being tempted into continuing spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bill?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, I've got several 100 wires here :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well what is it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think I'm meant to switch to hearts ... but I'm not sure I can find that in real life|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And I'm not allowed to take advantage of partner's huge pause over the spade 9|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|d8|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|d6|nt|hlortz: i think w would throw a @H if he held nothing inb the suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, and that spade pitch, wasn't it the highest spot card left?|pg||
nt|hlortz: but bill's point on the pause is well taken|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thomas Bessis is probably the world's best "still in his 20's player". Feel free to disagree|pg||
nt|hlortz: we havent seen much of him in th US yet but he's been impressive here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: We've seen him quite a lot on BBO in French events.  They are a fantastic partnership|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And on the Europe team in the Buffett Cup|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm not too surprised that they are in to the semis of the Vanderbilt.  Still, they do have good teammates :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: They play standard French almost nothing|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cT|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bridge_one: may be 2@c different means after open in 3th site|pg||

nt|gambit: given the state of the union too |pg||

nt|mrdct: just need to drop the stiff @SK offside to make game here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|gambit: dble by E was silly, if undiscusssed as to length, as W 's bidding suggrdtd|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, this time e/w lost 2 IMP, next time they will push n/s to 3 @d and win 4 IMP|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bjacobs: Finally, our appreciation to the ACBL, in particular Jeff Johnston and Jan Martel for broadcasting this prestigious event. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: In just over 12 hours, the semi-finals commence|pg||
nt|hlortz: ah yes and the tireless Roland Wald who puts this show together|pg||
nt|bjacobs: tireless, and as far as I can tell, sleepless|pg||
nt|mikael_w: soo, this is the last board of this set, I guess the time will be same as the days before. Then we will have a break for about 1 hour and 45 min|pg||
nt|gambit: ty to the player, our VuG operator, commentators and of course most importantly - the specs -  next session approx 1 hour away. Is that about right? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: will restart probably at 8:00pm PST|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: I may go for a kip now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need to find K sgl out |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I will confirm|pg||
nt|mikael_w: that is in 1 hour and 53 min from now right ?|pg||
nt|gambit: 11:00 pm EST last night so 60 _51 minutes|pg||
nt|gambit: + |pg||
nt|chick: except that we are now on EDT and PDT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: well is 6:08 pm here|pg||
nt|mikael_w: http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2010/01/vanderbilt/|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@s? :)|pg||
nt|gambit: 9:08 here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: 20 mins or so|pg||
nt|bjacobs: powernap|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So, Zimmermann vs Strul and de Knijff vs Fleisher in the semi-finals|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In exactly 12 hours from now|pg||
nt|ady: unless n/s can make 4@S  dropping sing King  looks like De Knijff will retain  a small lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikael_w: Here is a link to this tourney if you want to check the IMPs before next set starts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 8:00 pm will restart here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: double here just keeps auction alive, i.e. takeout|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: It's hard to commentate on this auction.  2@S ... was that a splinter?  Or some other form of raise?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: forcing raise i think|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: to game, with 2nt as the limit raise, but just a guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: So, enough of science, wheel out Old Trusty|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|mikael_w: Thx to my fellow comentators and to all kibz and special thanks to Debbie for a great job as usual|pg||
nt|dinos1: why not direct 4@s then?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|mikael_w: I know 3 @d was home this time, But NEXT time its not that sure|pg||
nt|mrdct: if south was declarer and hadn't disclosed such @S length, you could work on the theory that if @SJ isn't covered the K is offside and then play for the drop - but with J109 in ...|pg||
nt|mrdct: dummy that theory wont work|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|gambit: declarer will guess the spades (after all the red suit bidding by W) and quickly append 420 to his side of the balance sheet |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|nt|fabsayc: best line on this lead, suggestions?|pg||
nt|po-s: finesse trumps...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart finesse, or heart ace and go for discards|pg||
nt|hlortz: on the bidding @D are 6-1 so no worries|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bjacobs: Yes, and the @D3 confirms it|pg||
nt|hlortz: take the @H finesse|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So hook the heart without a care in the world|pg||
nt|po-s: still|pg||
nt|ady: just needs to get spade right   should do on the auction|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: Rabbi Rule rarely applied when appropriate|pg||
nt|gambit: TY to the players (fabulous bridge) the specs (wonderful silence), the VuG operator, (just plain great) and the commentators, hope you smiled, next session is (?) not ...|pg||
nt|gambit: sure....enjoyed, hope you all did too |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|gambit: 8@S from E on the low to the K@S|pg||
nt|mikael_w: maybe not if S thinks W has stiff @c and only 5-5 in red|pg||
nt|gambit: Lew will get it right |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Does that change anything? East is a big favourite to have spade length|pg||
nt|ady: chance for Fleisher   4@S -1 in OR|pg||
nt|dinos1: shape wasnt shown in OR|pg||
nt|dinos1: Weinstein showed only @d suit|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: Thanks to all spectators for watching. We hope you enjoyed the show and that you will be back in about 12 hours|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Cheers all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bye for now|pg||
nt|hlortz: and to all a good night|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i want a no blowout or refund clause :), good night all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: could have made it|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok, see you all when next set starts,|pg||
nt|ady: that the last  of the set?|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes - great work by debbie. particular relaying the comments being made by the players|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: yes|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great set -- Debbie please thank the players for us|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: okay|pg||
nt|gambit: thx Al H, super job |pg||
nt|mrdct: the next set is fairly soon i believe - with the meal break between the 2nd and 3rd segments|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I have found out that next set prob will start in about 15 min|pg||
nt|gambit: not much of a break....|pg||
nt|gambit: cheers to all |pg||
nt|ahollan1: next set scheduled to begin in 20 minutes -- but teams can restart whenever they want|pg||
nt|bridge_one: THX ALL for Wothching|pg||
nt|mrdct: if these guys played anywhere remotely close to 7.5 minutes per board they would get ample time for breaks and get to bed before midnight|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: mis guessed spade in OR|pg||
nt|mikael_w: so 10 IMP to n/s|pg||
mc|10|nt|dinos1: thx all|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|gambit: perhaps 3D was not such a good call, blueprinting the play.|pg||
nt|gambit: thx all |pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok, this will be as we predicted, a VERRY close match and realy exiting, so dont miss coming back in 1 hour and 45 min|pg||
pg||
