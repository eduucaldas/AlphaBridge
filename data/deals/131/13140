nt|eleni: in the open room 5@d were played for -1|pg||
nt|petrosa: maximum|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: now east alerts and west panics|pg||
nt|Gerben42: oh 1@S was a transfer|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or does it have an other meaning?|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|nt|mcphee: west has over stated the values of this hand|pg||
nt|Gerben42: half the fun then|pg||
nt|MolvaM: still a peaceful contract|pg||
nt|eleni: by N-S of course:)|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|Gerben42: @D is right? @S counts more|pg||
nt|tez: usually 2@s after an initial dbl is a stronger hand|pg||
nt|tez: with E i wld definitely bid 2@d over 1@s|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wander if the X and X from N made S belive more HPs at N. Don't have there CC|pg||
nt|lelos: i think 1@d shows unbalanced hand hence the 1@c|pg||
nt|eleni: no CCs available today, I hope there will be for the final 4s|pg||
nt|lelos: all other natural|pg||
nt|rodal f: After input from some specs: It seems that S took to much vitamins before the last bid:)|pg||

mb|2D|an|unknown majer|mb|2N|an|transfer for !C|nt|eleni: As we all know Bobolakis and George Karlaftis both are teams' players. They rarely risk their contracts|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|mcphee: N wants to bid more|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4@c is a good save|pg||

nt|MolvaM: against 140|pg||
nt|tez: 3nt pls:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4@C bound to get dbled|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3N will not be|pg||
nt|eleni: 4@d would be a bad bid by Dimos|pg||
nt|tez: trust your partner:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt gets doubled faster|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but north would run probably|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bmkl: no risk no return Eleni :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mcphee: you would be surprised if N dbled here and S bids 3N how often they save in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: S might have stepped in with 2@H here|pg||
nt|petrosa: another -1|pg||
nt|petrosa: bad luck|pg||
nt|liarakos: i am not sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: a little soft, but what the hect|pg||

pc|d4|nt|eleni: George you are right, Nick Perdikaris is an aggressive player:)|pg||
nt|ghionis: :)|pg||
nt|eleni: but in this case he decided to use the law of total tricks|pg||
nt|eleni: and it will work|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yes we are surprised :)|pg||
nt|eleni: true, this is why on board 16 they lost an IMP|pg||
pc|cT|nt|tez: 1 down|pg||
nt|mcphee: things lay well for declarer|pg||
nt|liarakos: 5@H x in the open|pg||
pc|c7|nt|eleni: a wild bidding:)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|liarakos: -2 probably so 11 imps to Levi|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mcphee: W overstepped hi bounds with this 4@S bid|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|mcphee: good point, but as @D run nothing helps|pg||
nt|eleni: 3dx=|pg||
nt|harmon: true I just pointed it out cause Stevo did that to me to beat me, I almost got it right cause it was Stevo|pg||
pc|sK|nt|eleni: not this board:):) that was for the operator of the other table:):) board 5@h|pg||

nt|jcone: no chance of Queen play now|pg||
nt|mcphee: which would have a good shot had he overcalled:)|pg||
nt|lelos: another 4 imps for altinis here since 9 tricks are easy|pg||
pc|c4|nt|liarakos: oops|pg||
pc|c5|pc|dT|nt|rodal f: ? Kill the cat. And @S|pg||
nt|lelos: not very carefull play by coach|pg||

nt|tez: with a bal hand with  defensive values in @d and limit opening hand|pg||
nt|MolvaM: they are sweet ladies remember|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I guess east had an opinion about 4@H|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|MolvaM: so they expect their opps to be polite in defence|pg||
