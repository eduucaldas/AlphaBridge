mb|2C|mb|p|nt|han: 4SX might be -500 but can be -800 if the defense manages to play trumps quickly enough|pg||
mb|2N|an|!|mb|p|nt|han: what's double here?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|han: is it "please bid 4H if you have hearts"?|pg||
nt|han: or is it just penalty|pg||
nt|sybarra: Berten's had a great hand.... yikes that is over the top..|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@H on a minor suit squeeze?|pg||
mb|p|nt|han: no chance on this lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: not after this lead|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|fann4: I think 6@H was a great bid, though it won't make.|pg||
nt|hedyg: i agree Jeff|pg||
nt|han: west plays 5-6, high-low would not be asking for a ruff but would be suit preferenc|pg||
nt|han: e|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: no cost to leading another club is there?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|han: so 5-6 should ask for a club return|pg||

nt|hedyg: well if not the @Cs certainly looked better|pg||
nt|han: south showed 4+ hearts and dummy has 1098|pg||
mb|1C|an|!|nt|han: not a great suit to switch to|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|an|! 5+D, 4+c, limit or better|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|han: he didn't know that one club trick was enough, then he also needed spades to split 3-3|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hedyg: in @H he needed 2 finesses , in @c just 1|pg||
nt|han: but he could combine chances, hook heart, cash AK of clubs, if queen drops, test spades and if they split he doesn't need the secondheart hook|pg||
nt|hedyg: and then 1 of the black suits to come in|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|sybarra: well 3 @C  is better that 4 sp (I think) |pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: pull AK@S before @d ruff|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|helene_t:  difficult to reach 2@h playing standard methods. E might want to bid 2@h over 1NT but for most pairs that would show extra values|pg||

pc|sK|pc|h4|pc|d3|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|han: in the latest results, Schollaardt-Wortel are leading by 1 IMP|pg||
nt|han: second place is for Verbeek-van Zwol|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|han: I don't expect Bertens and Westra to get to game after 1NT|pg||
nt|helene_t:  3@h shows a good spade raise. 3@s ould have been weaker|pg||
mb|p|nt|helene_t:  would|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: so much for @cs|pg||
nt|han: and certainly not after 2H|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: sorry misread the handwritting|pg||
mb|p|pc|s5|nt|han: maybe it is possible, if Huub now bids 3C|pg||
nt|hedyg: gazilli would work well here|pg||
nt|fann4: They got to 5@C other table after a 2@H rebid.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would bid 2 @C on the first round,  (yes I know have 6 hts) |pg||
nt|han: Westra has a difficult decision|pg||
nt|han: I must admit I would have bid 2C instead of 2H|pg||
nt|fann4: Me too.|pg||
nt|hedyg: that @c suit is certainly good enough to bid|pg||
nt|han: don't really understand 2H with these suits, but in old school you have to rebid your major with a minimal 6-4|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe they do not have to have 4 to bid it |pg||
nt|fann4: And the @H suit is weak enough to not have to rebid.|pg||
nt|hedyg: over 2@c by S N could have bid 2@s etc|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|hedyg: ok so lets try 3@s now|pg||
nt|han: 3S keeps 3NT in the game|pg||
nt|sybarra: and one suggestion is that N could bid 2 @C  over 1 ht |pg||
nt|han: I think Bertens will bid 3NT, he has told his story|pg||
nt|hedyg: if Bertens finds a 4@d bid now..|pg||
nt|han: and he even has help in diamonds|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|helene_t:  W's name has been corrected. thanks, operator :)|pg||
nt|mwigor: hi all|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: hi michael :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mwigor: this looks like one down|pg||
pc|c4|nt|han: oh, I was wrong about that|pg||
nt|hedyg: think again? LOL|pg||
nt|han: they reached it, now they have to make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: they got it right,  thats why they are playing :)|pg||
nt|han: Schollaardt loves underleading kings|pg||
nt|han: so he'll be happy here, spades or diamonds|pg||
nt|han: I would guess diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Westra says: I meant 3@s as a super card for @c's and he saw that as well|pg||
nt|han: because of the auction|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|han: high from  even with an honor|pg||
nt|han: slavinski leads|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes and Bertens understood that|pg||
nt|han: toughest lead for declarer|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mwigor: maybe a chance to make|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|han: he has only 1 loser but where will he get his tricks?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mwigor: @sA ruffing @s hook is probably best both on the hand and single dummy|pg||
nt|mwigor: but looks like she cant quite cope with the 4-1 trump break|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c5|pc|h3|pg||

nt|han: Bertens must expect good hands for the vulnerable 2D bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|hedyg: ok ty Monique|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is butler scoring (pairs)  the imps are averaged and the scores compared to average for imps|pg||
mb|3C|an|!|mb|3D|nt|fann4: AQJxxx with nothing outside is the least I'd expect when vul.|pg||
nt|han: ok, but you are not Dutch|pg||
mb|p|an|!|nt|mwigor: welcome back|pg||
mb|5D|nt|hedyg: lolol|pg||
nt|helene_t:  interesting 1NT rebid. do you know if that is systematic, Fiona?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s8|nt|han: it is quite uncommon here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|helene_t:  I suppose NS play a weak 1NT opening, so that the 1NT rebid shows 15-17 points. |pg||
pc|sA|nt|fann4: How low do the Dutch go - when vul?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 cards and ??? |pg||
nt|han: what do you mean 6 cards?|pg||
nt|hedyg: does 2@c promise a major?|pg||
nt|han: Does QJxxx count as 6 cards?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mwigor: it feels like south bid her hand one time too many there|pg||
nt|mwigor: a little lucky not to be doubled|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: sorry i havent got the play |pg||
nt|mwigor: np|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|fann4: Pushy invite by N here - maybe the 3 tens influenced him.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|han: I think it is an automatic invite, this is a very nice 8-count|pg||
nt|fann4: QJxxx . not in my book. Vul I didn't think it was in anyone's book.|pg||
nt|han: This is a tricky hand for NS|pg||
nt|han: we know the club queen is dropping|pg||
nt|han: but will Huub test that before he takes the second heart hook?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|helene_t:  the club lead actually gives N a chance of making the contract, if she finds the queen of spades|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hedyg: he will disc @hs|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|han: oh wait, he doesn't need the heart hook|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhhhh no|pg||
nt|han: he'll just play on clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: not anymore|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|han: no, this is not looking good for Bertens|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|hedyg: all eggs in the @H basket|pg||
pc|d4|nt|helene_t:  but she doesnt kno that hearts are 5-3. if they were 4-4 then conceeding a diamond trick would be the way to make the contract without having to guess spades|pg||
