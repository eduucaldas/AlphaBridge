mb|p|nt|dinos1: Cornelia :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dinos1: with soft values and strong short suits better not ask majors|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: Hi Prakash|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hi Cam and specs|pg||
nt|gambit: One might expect N/S to swing a little, down by 50....maybe we will see some fireworks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness explaining their methods: open lowest with more than 1 4-card suit|pg||
nt|jtr: North can duck 2 @ss to worry declarer|pg||

mb|p|nt|stewball: hi everyone|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: EW defensive carding is standard count but upside-down attitude|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Fleisher +65 vs Diamond and de Knijff +46 vs Zaleski. Lynch has withdrawn against Strul|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: Hi Roland and Vladimir|pg||
nt|panja: Usually, the third seat preempt is 'wide range' and is expected to bother opps..but here, it likely helped them|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: walid: what was your shape?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: seemed better to pitch a club on the third heart, then play a spade|pg||
mb|1H|nt|dinos1: better to play @s to J and set 5th @d|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thxto Wayne:) Here u are the score after segment 2: http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2010/01/vanderbilt/|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: strul 151-lynch 51, and zimmermann 96-onstott 41|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: er, strul 131-lynch 51|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last night we tried something with one commentator seeing only 1 hand|pg||
nt|stoffers: EW dont want to get to high in @d here|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|jtr: Oh?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|gambit: Huge lead for Strul, hopefully this match will become a little closer, adds to the flavour |pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: 100% line coz def didnt lead @c to that moment|pg||
mb|3C|nt|dburn: this is a fair slam, but again the play is not straightforward|pg||
nt|dburn: and nor is the bidding - not quite sure what Passell intends here|pg||
nt|jtr: Might pass even facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|jtr: He did|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am now sitting east, will try not to seem too stupid|pg||
nt|jtr: Hellness considering 2@d|pg||
nt|jtr: And Martin i guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1nt looks normal with the scattered cards|pg||
nt|stoffers: yes, but he also knows south has short @d and Geir didnt run so cant be that good|pg||
nt|jtr: I think he will pass eventually|pg||
nt|jtr: We just have to live long enough to see it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: nobody really knows here but i trust partner and pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: could his pard only have 3 @D? |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: no doubt 4@d is Blackwood for clubs, but...|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@d was? @crkcb?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: I will forward any explanations I can read or overhear|pg||
nt|dburn: ...that seems a little odd with no control in either of the unbid suits|pg||
nt|chick: I'm told by a spec that it is a transfer to hearts, not sure if that is true or not :)|pg||
nt|stoffers: no, 4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no, 4 card majors|pg||
nt|jtr: Voila as they say in Canada|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: NS play 1@C could be 2 if 4432, so 1@D is always real diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: no, e/w open 4 card suits or better|pg||
nt|sybarra: and poor Becker can not even lead a @D |pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is terrifying|pg||
nt|stoffers: 3@s NS in open i hear|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok just checking did not have cc up |pg||
nt|stoffers: 1@d-1NT-2@d majors|pg||
nt|stoffers: isntead of double|pg||
nt|stoffers: well, how will 1NTx do folks?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you folks are telling me the diamonds are a dead end, but dont see anything else to try|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: e/w west also open lower of 4 card suits ie 1H with 4 s's and 4h's|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, North will be confident at this point|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: twas passell thinking there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness quits fidgeting with his pencil and leans over the table to examine dummy|pg||
nt|gambit: the lead looks terrifying from W perspective|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps i should cash hearts first |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dburn: whether confident enough to double, we will discover|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: el ahmady in a hurry to push the tray after !4C; helness slows him down and alerts.  writing explanations on both sides of screen|pg||

nt|sybarra: have to stay out of slam here   |pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: 5@D is the perfect spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Last time I said here we go up and running the table closed down immediately so not this time|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: shhhhhhhhhsss David,  dont do that |pg||
nt|davidstern: Everybody a fan of reversing?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Richard, if you give me declarer, contract and number of tricks on 17 and 18, I will give you the codes to insert in MOVIE|pg||
nt|davidstern: I wouldnt mind opening 1@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: with reverse, seems to me you should bid 3 @D |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I think it's worth a reverse|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@H would suggest 6/5|pg||
mb|3H|nt|davidstern: Now|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|Walddk2: Playing strength is enormous|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: So he has shown his 5/6|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: tossed @s7, @c7 onto table and claimed the rest|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade AJx with north was only chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: irritation showing|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: no 2NT this time|pg||
nt|stoffers: didnt matter, but looked strange.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|dinos1: not a good start for EW in this segment|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 1@D not alerted by Passell but Strul shows two fingers and Passell nods|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bergen raise|pg||
nt|jtr: Shitty opening in that position|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: a desperate S will bid 4, a disciplined one  - not so sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes north could cash diamond and south pitch the spade loser|pg||
nt|sybarra: "any 11"  ?|pg||
nt|stoffers: 3@d promises 4@c + and opening values|pg||
nt|jtr: No pips 2nd at red and no rebid|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|panja: on E's rather..|pg||
nt|jtr: Apart from that it is fine|pg||
nt|stoffers: 4@s??|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could getted X'd |pg||
nt|jtr: 5@c?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should be 55 in spades and diamonds|pg||
mb|2D|nt|stoffers: did becker think 2@d was majors here|pg||
nt|stoffers: ahh|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double|pg||
nt|sybarra: the doubling will start now |pg||
nt|jtr: Nah:)|pg||
nt|stoffers: if S bids 5@s he will get extremely lucky with that dummy|pg||
nt|jtr: Why didnt he open?|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: Linda darling!!!!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Helness and Helgemo are that stabil that NS don't even think abough 4@H|pg||
nt|lml: hey Harmon |pg||
nt|gambit: what a balance!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: immediate 3@S, apparently had decided to balance over 3@H while Sadek had the tray|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 6@D makes because of the lucky lie of the red suits|pg||
nt|stoffers: if im having a misunderstanding like that dummy comes 1363 and queens and jacks :)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|dinos1: 2@d - GF checkback|pg||
nt|xenya: on 49, the bidding in OR was entirely different -- S opened 1@C (not 3@C as here) and it was W who preempted with 3@S -- no wonder EW stayed out of game |pg||
mb|4N|nt|dburn: this is not the worst 6@d in the world, and it will make on this lie of cards, but bidding it will be quite a feat|pg||
nt|dinos1: one more minor slam|pg||
nt|dinos1: now 2N - 3@d?|pg||
nt|dburn: especially since up to now, diamonds have not actually been bid at all|pg||
nt|dburn: if East bids 3@d now, they have some sort of chance, but...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: lynch folds her hand, crosses her arms, looks at her cards again|pg||
nt|gambit: double |pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: helness can sniff helgemo's stiff @H on the bidding|pg||
nt|panja: 4@s a nice spot..|pg||
nt|panja: once again trump lead will be the best for defence|pg||
mb|5C|nt|dburn: ...well, she bid it|pg||
nt|panja: Decl will likely take the A, discards, and xruf|pg||
nt|stoffers: is becker alowed to pass this if partner has 5+ 5+ diamonds and spades?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps club king lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: well - W has good hand for pd|pg||
mb|5D|nt|Vugraphzfe: kibitzer asks Passell for permission to sit behind him - normally no one bothers to ask|pg||
nt|dinos1: side aces and KJ in trump suit|pg||
nt|stewball: and a legit @d suit|pg||
nt|dburn: not clear what 3@h is - 4@d would have been clearer to East, but Passell may intend to support diamonds at a later stage|pg||
nt|dinos1: @sJ wd be golden )|pg||
nt|stewball: i think 3@h is a punt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: carolyn still working it out|pg||
nt|dburn: Lynch not clear what it is either - if I were West it would show worry about clubs for 3NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: strul examining EW system card|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3@s now, no?|pg||
nt|dburn: but in any case East seems to have a 3@s bid and let the chips fall|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. Would have payed|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: now 4@c|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: yes, seems to cover all possibilities|pg||
nt|harmon: back to a ht and 4th d|pg||
nt|harmon: oops|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness leans over the table for a closer look at @CK|pg||
nt|gambit: I would too...........|pg||
nt|rodal f: If u take those two payers I put my money at Helness. A teambuilder and a sniffing nose better then the most of us.|pg||
nt|lml: it is an awlward card though|pg||
nt|gambit: Fabulous players, with the nose(s) of a bloodhound|pg||
nt|lml: this is a link for the half time scores http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2010/01/vanderbilt/|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: walid looking around, slightly impatient.  Sadek sitting back in his chair looking calm|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: and helgemo is always stoic|pg||
nt|rodal f: We don't use that type of dogs to much in Norway Cam:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: no doubt Passell intends that as keycard for diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: but I confess that if I were East, the whole thing would be a complete mystery to me|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Vugraphzfe: strul writing a question then puts his pen on top so I can't read|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if East can work it out the final contract will be 6@d, but if she can't, there is the horrid possibility that it might be 4@h|pg||
nt|dinos1: I was await 4@c cue, but 4@h - it's above me|pg||
nt|chick: have to admit, I'd figure W for a lot of hearts right about now|pg||
nt|dinos1: mb it's @d rkcb? :)|pg||
nt|dburn: I ma sure that it is, but East is not sure at all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: the alerted 4@D previously and alerted 4@H here suggest EW are playing kickback over minors|pg||
nt|dinos1: but why E is thinking so long?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: but now that you mention it, I didn't see lynch alert 4@H when the tray came through|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: NS both holding their cards below the table and looking down|pg||
nt|chick: I wonder if they are using the old rule that says cards have to be played on the same day they are dealt?  :)|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a tough position for Carolyn Lynch - the spectators all know what West's bidding means, and so do North, South, West and I|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: kibitzer H. Lall seems to have fallen asleep|pg||
nt|chick: does this count for sominex coup?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sorry I can't get any read from carolyn, behind her shoulder so I can't see her face.  she's sitting very still this whole time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: strul gestures like he can't believe what's going on|pg||
nt|dburn: she may be wondering why, if partner did not bid Blackwood over 3@d,he can bid it over 3@s|pg||
nt|dinos1: better was cue 4@c and let E ask with 4@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: passell: carolyn, you've got to do something.  this is just ridiculous|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Good hand for Blackwood|pg||

nt|jtr: Well, with transfer responses you can bid 3@c natural with some methods|pg||
nt|stoffers: im surprised helness didnt bid 3@c then 3NT showing a slamtry in @c here|pg||

nt|warrens:  his best play was a quick duck.  that way if W won the trick, he might return it hoping his partner had the ace|pg||

nt|royhughes: To any confused observers, we are just getting over some technical problems and getting caught up in the match|pg||
mb|2D|an|A|nt|jtr: Strong pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Passell was only 1 point short, have seen 1N on that HCP many times (although this one didn't have much worth upgrading)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: becker always holds his cards below the table, looking down with his glasses halfway down his nose|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: N/E discussing play in 6@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness: you have trouble in discarding|pg||
nt|panja: 25 HCP with NS... 3Nt might not make though..|pg||

nt|harmon: sweet innocent me??|pg||
nt|harmon: no reason for N to bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: this treatment was popular yesterday, rebidding 1NT with only one of partner's spades|pg||
nt|panja: S reluctant to rebid 1N because of inadequate @D control?|pg||
nt|panja: it would be interesting to guess the lead.....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: walid sits straight up and clasps his hands above his head|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|gambit: you may be sweet harmon, but innocent? Don't think so ...but we love you so|pg||

nt|Cavendish: please welcome RodalF, who is norwegian and perhaps can provide some insight into the wonderfully NATURAL norwegian way of bidding |pg||

nt|gambit: if N/S want to make up some ground they need to be a little more active, can't beat these guys playing down the middle |pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: it is refreshing after alerting 1@D as 2+ to have two pairs playing it as 4+|pg||
nt|harmon: this was not the hand for it tho|pg||
nt|panja: @SAKx is good.....but the values in the side suits don't really point to a suit contract...so perhaps S should have preferred a 1nt rebid second time, but as the cards are, 4@S ...|pg||
nt|panja: will do better than 3Nt|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: South was trying to protect his red suit holdings but west will lead a @H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: walid lays down his cards and holds his head in his hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness straightens his passes on the tray|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: it seems walid is holding his head more than the cards :)|pg||

pc|sT|nt|gambit: great play by E, might well work on other layouts |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sadek had all his tricks facing the same direction.  Walid: you have one trick.  my ace.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|lml: a club now holds it to 1|pg||

pc|d4|nt|Vugraphzfe: yes that's what happened.  never got his spade, just cashed out the rest|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Vugraphzfe: EW play standard count but upside-down attitude so @D4 was encouraging|pg||
nt|xenya: the @S finesse was not unreasonable but now it should be 3 off|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: laughter from behind the barrier, from the greco-hampson-martel-stansby table I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness still agonizing over the @D|pg||

nt|sybarra: or am I "resulting" it?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|davidstern: This board being played 3@CX by north in CR|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|nt|sybarra: there was not reason on the auction that @H lead was indicated....  |pg||
nt|davidstern: EW have 4 tricks and East still holding KJ9x of trumps|pg||
nt|sybarra: *no|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:  2@D promises a club stopper, though i'm surprised he didn't XX|pg||

mb|p|nt|davidstern: Yes redouble saerious offer to play would have been good|pg||
nt|sybarra: this should be interesting |pg||

pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|davidstern: Things are bad when the defence have 5 tricks and you havent played trumps holding @DAxxx opposite @DQx|pg||

nt|jtr: Still, if that is their style who am i to criticise|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sorry, thought it was a rhetorical question :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: I don't bid on the South hand.  I was wondering if Helgemo might bid 2@c and pass any response, which could work out badly on this hand|pg||
mb|2D|nt|dinos1: quick -1|pg||
nt|harmon: now its not lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: perhaps not|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness says "wow!" then laughs|pg||
nt|jbgood: not yet, but fingers have gone asleep|pg||
nt|royhughes: His partner has the worst shape for him for that idea|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But the answer is: no, that hand is a pass|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Some play XX shows 5 clubs|pg||
nt|royhughes: This is a deal that noone really wants to be declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: quite common I think, to use business xx's in this situation|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I would like to have a shot a 2@Cxx is partner has anything|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, and partnerships need to know if pass and xx deny a 4-card major or not|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The 2@C device (planning to pass a response) is well known.  The only ugly hand opposite it is 3=3=2=5 shape, and guess what ...|pg||
mb|d|nt|chick: good pass with a flat 8 points, will be lucky to make 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: either a fit showing 3c or 4d would give a chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: Strul has to contain himself here,  they are at limit |pg||
nt|royhughes: inspired, anyway|pg||
mb|3C|nt|dinos1: 5@c and 2A to lose|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: becker lifts a card above the table then lowers it again|pg||
nt|stoffers: should be one off on a @h ruff|pg||
nt|stoffers: 2 i mean|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe one beyond limit |pg||
nt|stoffers: if they can get the K@d aswell :)|pg||
nt|stoffers: k@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: I would suspect neither Becker will count out and drop sK maybe|pg||
nt|royhughes: A kibitzer pointed out that some partnerships then allow West to bid 2@h for a choice in the majors|pg||
nt|royhughes: Not that that is wonderful|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now it's turning into a nightmare for E/W - can they escape to something undoubled?|pg||
nt|royhughes: This was an interesting call by Nunes -- anyone know what it means?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|jbgood: hm.. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: sort takeout-penaltyish|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: I think North might have done more|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: no chance to find out|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well,  lets try 4 @C.....|pg||
nt|fabsayc: helness hoping for spade lead|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|sybarra: and he got it |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Ah, I see Fantoni also read it as takeout-penaltyish, and of course, he didn't know what to do|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Classically, it's called an "optional" double.  Basically, the world's worst convention|pg||
nt|jbgood: now Helness's careful pass over 2@c x pays off |pg||
nt|royhughes: There are so many possible situations once everyone starts bidding.  Anyone seen this sequence before, or anything remotely like it?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Not often|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So there is only one solution to auctions you have never seen before|pg||
nt|jbgood: not ever|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Fantoni showed no emotion, deep in thought|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And that is to have firm principles.  |pg||
nt|Walddk3: There is a first time for everything. You were here when it happened; aren't you thrilled?|pg||
nt|royhughes: You are so right|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "We play takeout doubles"  or "We play penalty doubles"|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Surely if 2@Cx showed clubs the double of 2@D must suggest a penalty|pg||
nt|royhughes: Nothing is comfortable for declarer here -- he might lead a spade away from dummy to start trying to ruff in hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Unfortunately, most would disagree with the "surely" Paul ... the rest might be fine|pg||
nt|royhughes: or maybe just play diamonds and let the defense do something|pg||
nt|royhughes: which I think would be my choice|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You know what I find the most interesting and instructive comment on this deal?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  He knows west was prepared for 2@H or 2@S so it must be penalties (mustnt it:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "Fantoni shows no emotion, deep in thought"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That truly is a thought-provoking observation|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Could you match it?|pg||
nt|royhughes: Fantoni has been through many, many difficult situations|pg||
nt|royhughes: This is just one more|pg||
nt|bjacobs: We all have.  But 99.9% of us are thinking about the bidding whilst the first couple of tricks are played :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, it takes a great player to get the most tricks from a tough situation like this|pg||
nt|royhughes: A kibitzer asks what we think of the double of 2@c.  A matter of style, I think|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Getting too many comments to reply to you all please excuse if I miss you|pg||
nt|Walddk3: You still looking at the East hand only, Bill?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No, but on this hand Roland, I would be happy to!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Licking lips ...|pg||
nt|paulhac:  How many do we think he will go down?|pg||
nt|royhughes: The EW distributions seem to be known, and after the lead, the high cards are pretty much placed, too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: It would appear to me that the scores are reversed in the open and closed rooms and will need to be corrected|pg||
nt|royhughes: But even double dummy this is a difficult deal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: no they are correct|pg||
nt|Walddk3: He will not go down if he doesn't play a card|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I guess it's a possible strategy, Roland|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: well, everyone just realized Fantoni won the trick in dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: I suspect 3 knew it :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  A diamond now might let him off for 300 |pg||
nt|royhughes: A kibitzer asked what Fantoni is thinking -- I would say he has placed most of the cards and is trying to calculate exactly|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think the normal play is the small diamond.  If East gets a ruff, you sort of keep control|pg||
nt|paulhac:  He should be pretty certain that Geir is 4-4-4-1|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: Bit late. Specs to answer. Ain't N at a clear 4@D bid?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|dinos1: @cA and @c back wd make def more clear for S|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|bjacobs: Back on the auction, perhaps Fantoni was trapped by his @D10xxx into thinking the double must be for takeout|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 3s was beatable|pg||
nt|jtr: yes 2 as i said|pg||
nt|jtr: or maybe 1 actually|pg||
nt|royhughes: This might be a weak 2@d for some partnerships, but Fantoni and Nunes play very different 2-bids|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Italians are discussing interpretations of bids given during auction|pg||
nt|royhughes: It is one reason they are so much fun to watch|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: director being called|pg||
nt|royhughes: When they play faster than last hand, I mean|pg||
nt|royhughes: Just when we thought the deal was over!|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Wonder if the pass of 2@C was alerted on both sides of the table?|pg||
nt|royhughes: What language do the players use for explanations?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: discussion is based on whether pass of dbl 2c can have 4 card major|pg||
nt|Walddk3: English|pg||
nt|jbgood: they play 2@d at the other table.. after 1 NT - p - 2 @c - dbl - 2 @d all pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: initial explanation to Fantoni was that pass denied club stopper|pg||
nt|royhughes: That's a strange action, 2@d|pg||
nt|jbgood: denying majors:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: board will be reviewed by directors, moving on|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: one way or the other 4@H was not the right bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|Vugraphzfe: I gather Walid was not hoping for 4@H to float|pg||

mb|p|nt|harmon: was hoping to get dbled in 5 or 6 assuming they had sp fit|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|dinos1: low @s - make|pg||
nt|dinos1: @sQ - necessary entry for 2 @d fins|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|panja: card even..|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jtr: Meanwhile, 3@c has problems too|pg||

nt|jtr: Hi Paul|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Helness asks about carding|pg||
nt|jtr: Remember, North made a bid and South declined to make one|pg||
nt|jtr: Odds are @dK with shortage in North|pg||

nt|lml: thats all there is|pg||

nt|xenya: yes, that would have been a killer but hard to find...|pg||
nt|xenya: even for Helgemo|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: room full of vacant chairs but some kibitzers standing for a better view|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: NOT so tough as he knows P has only 3 @S and he has no entry|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what is East plays @H10 now|pg||
nt|panja: I think he would have worked it out had the match been a little more tight...I guess he isn't playing full throttle so to say, to conserve energy?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: true Prakash|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|panja: the @D play might make W think S holds the @CK, that is also another factor|pg||

mb|p|nt|royhughes: We're getting our Stayman workout here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 4@D=slamtry|pg||
nt|gambit: must try 4@H|pg||
nt|lml: is there any kind of play for 6NT?  The wrong hand has the diamond ace for a throw in|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sadek rolls his neck, then leans forward - about as much body language as you'll see from him|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: walid fanning his cards on the table|pg||
nt|gambit: after the 4C bid, best to lie low |pg||
nt|gambit: 4@H/4@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive Harmon agree with u Cam.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness yawns again.  I wonder if these players suffer from jet lag, 9+ hours behind their home time zone|pg||
nt|lml: I think a heart lead will prevent 6NT|pg||
nt|gambit: of course South might have cause to imagine his partner's diamonds to be MUCH better|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Vugraphzfe: walid stops examining his hand and leans forward to examine dummy more closely|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Bit more play here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dinos1: now @c - then =|pg||
nt|lml: but that will be the normal lead|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dinos1: this is +2|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|lml: yes you are all right.  Anything but a heart it can be made on a double squeeze|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: starting with round of 16 the vanderbilt is played with screens which run diagonally across the table so players cannot see their partners mannerisms|pg||
nt|gambit: tempting to try, thaat 4D bid was sedductive, let's see if he can resist|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: during the auction the boards are passed back and forth through a curtain.  after the auction a window is opened so all players can see one another's played cards and the dummy|pg||
nt|harmon: not i cant as lomg as E retains Jxx of hts|pg||
nt|dinos1: wonder - at all 4 tables 4@h+3 was played (b.38)|pg||
nt|gambit: Imagine Akxxxx xx Akx xx |pg||
nt|lml: I think that South should discount the @CQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sadek still contemplating his next call|pg||
nt|rodal f: Just for fun. If N had 3@H and single @C by a 6NTS|pg||
nt|gambit: and the 4@D call, that was inflammatory |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness clears his throat for the hundredth time and riffles his cards.  seems impatient|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helgemo looks like he could sit in that posture forever|pg||
nt|rodal f: There way to be John:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: one arm across his chest, other elbow on his wrist, scratching his chin|pg||
nt|lml: the way you have to make it in 6NT assuming no heart lead is actually a kind of strip squeeze|pg||
nt|lml: you have to play a diamond from dummy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Helgemo by the pokerface and Helness the former world champ at poker|pg||
nt|lml: East has to duck|pg||
nt|lml: then you run all your winners and West has to hold three clubs (and therefore two hearts)|pg||
nt|jbgood: needs more than luck to land it I think |pg||
nt|jbgood: a good start though|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lml: you cash the hearts and throw him in|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I wonder if they would have bid 4 vulnerable?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lml: so that is our fairy tale for today|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: the time "limit" is 150 minutes for 16 boards|pg||
nt|harmon: cant east keep Jxx of hts??|pg||
nt|gambit: If Helgemo doubled  - would that say don't lead my suit?|pg||
nt|lml: no because then you dont cash the hearts|pg||
nt|lml: you play club club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: but enforcement is difficult because often both sides are at fault|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|lml: its a five card ending|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: moss-gitelman/fleisher-kamil fell far behind on time in Q1 then rushed to catch up|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: in Q2, lynch-passell took ages for the first few boards, then took a walk to shake off a disaster|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|gambit: note how Ebid his 5 card suit(vs his 6 card suit) and what a wonderful bid it was for his side , wd|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 2nt: "four trumps and game forcing"|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lml: okay you all love squeezes.  Great comments from spec|pg||
nt|gambit: not going to make this |pg||
nt|lml: there is something about a winkle but I dont have time to think about it|pg||
nt|harmon: why??|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|paulhac:  He should be able to raed the club suit and get his spade away but can he ruff 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|royhughes: Right -- 2 rounds of trumps would be too many|pg||
nt|royhughes: Because Helgemo could then ruff a club and play a 3rd trump|pg||
nt|royhughes: So maybe hook a club right away|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: Not?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: helness drumming on table|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Vugraphzfe: Sadek looks disappointed to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: believe 3H showed short heart and several types of hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: this is obviously a secret Arabic auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: will give explanations if/when the norwegians ask|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: walid writing on pad unprompted|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: then helness picks it up so I can't see|pg||
nt|gambit: grocery list?|pg||
nt|lml: okay we now now this shows hearts and diamonds and I understand it is a GF|pg||
nt|harmon: duck one spade play on hts for 3n|pg||

nt|paulhac:  Both of these pairs will be playing for Europe in the Buffett Cup in September|pg||
nt|royhughes: Something is wrong here -- if 2@s was a limit raise in clubs, doesn't West bid more?|pg||
nt|jbgood: No NT by Helgemo?|pg||
nt|royhughes: There isn't a partscore of 40!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hard to believe this auction|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Phillip?  They are playing a pathetic 3@C contract?|pg||
nt|jbgood: some system misunderstanding for sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: yes and Helgemo doesn't look happy|pg||
nt|jbgood: so 2@s was meant as a preempt in @cs?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: If nothing else, it's good for the match|pg||
nt|bjacobs: no kidding, he doesn't look happy!  Even Fantoni wouldn't be serene if he saw that dummy|pg||

nt|royhughes: OK, this is better|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Vugraphzfe: this may be the first time becker has broken tempo|pg||
nt|dburn: this is not so easy - GIB would make it by playing North for @hJ, but Mike Passell may try to make it by playing North for @sK instead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sits upright even|pg||
nt|stoffers: yes, can have 4@s also. They prefere to show shortness first |pg||

nt|jbgood: kibs suggest that this time Norwegian will be spoken under the screen when this one has been played|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: this looks like a fine spot to me|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: walid asks helness's permission to see the east hand on 40|pg||

nt|harmon: good they paying attention to me|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sadek still planning|pg||
nt|harmon: Rodal STILLE pls.|pg||

nt|lml: West had bid hearts (not clubs)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jtr: But the defence....|pg||
nt|stoffers: questionable 3NT with only 1 stopper from Helsness, but he had nowhere else to go :)|pg||

mb|p|pc|sA|nt|Vugraphzfe: kibitzer walks through wearing a lei.  today is hawaii day: hawaii is part of host District 20|pg||

pc|s8|nt|dburn: not ridiculous for East to have bid 2@d at some stage - better that than have partner lead a heart or a club against 1NT|pg||

pc|s3|nt|sunsamvar: or ruff a @D|pg||
nt|xenya: but this hand could produce a double game swing for Onstott -- in theory|pg||
pc|s8|nt|dinos1: now @s back and?|pg||
nt|dinos1: must play @sA|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|stewball: not such a hard play|pg||

mb|2D|nt|stewball: how about 7|pg||
nt|dinos1: 7@d isnt good but 6 is excellent|pg||
mb|3C|nt|warrens:  I think the question is, will they find 7?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|xenya: N might compete with 2@S|pg||
nt|stoffers: 1@s or 1NT here folks?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  1NT |pg||
nt|royhughes: Maybe -- he likes to be long in the opened suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: all tables playing the same boards this round|pg||
nt|panja: 2@D doesn't seem better than a dbl here...but with a 4-4 fit..the bid will do better than 1Nt dbl..|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: e/w found a good spot here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: slow pass from Helgemo, quick pass from El Ahmady|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jtr: 14-16 1NT is ok with me|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If I had to name one bridge book that you should buy in order to improve your game, I think it would be "The Complete Book of Overcalls", by Mike Lawrence|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: seven probably not with the odds - seems to need two 3-2 breaks|pg||
nt|sybarra: and if play 15-17?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: N/S have not been swinging, perhaps last set will be more active|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: walid asks behind the screen.  helness: could be 5-5.  not 6-4, normally|pg||
nt|stoffers: lol, i got 12 specs answers in 3 seconds, 6 for @s, 6 for 1NT! People really judge differently :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Multon does|pg||
nt|paulhac:  1@S|pg||
nt|stoffers: thats a 5-17 yes sybarra|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dburn: but maybe some 4-1 diamond breaks can be handled|pg||
nt|dinos1: in 7 both mm's shd be 3-2 (or 3@d4@c in 1 hand)|pg||
nt|gambit: LOL, Stewy you make me laugh, and that (as Martha says - is a good thing), I think we forget that it is so easy seeing all hands, these players deserve our praise, they play at the ...|pg||
nt|gambit: top, and btw I did ask Eric Murray, Sami Kehela and Roy Hughes to Autorgraph Roy's book - for me dad. He was thrilled. |pg||
nt|dburn: but the break-even point for a grand slam is around the percentage chance of one 3-2 break (a little over 68%)|pg||
nt|stewball: thats what \i'm here for:)|pg||
nt|dinos1: Strul will continue with 4@c|pg||
nt|paulhac:  This will test Geirs declarer play|pg||
nt|royhughes: Helgemo didn't want this preference!|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|dinos1: )))|pg||
nt|harmon: 4hts +3 was a push|pg||
nt|jtr: 3NT looks slightly better than 4@s|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lml: 6@S isnt terrible|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn: so, if you need a 3-2 break plus some handling, you should not be in seven|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: strul has been very composed throughout.  can't read what he's thinking, no indication he was about to take this leap|pg||
pc|s8|nt|dinos1: he has strong indication pd has stiff @h|pg||
nt|dburn: unless of course you are GIB, which would make seven without breaking sweat (not that software can sweat, but...)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|paulhac:  Are you sure David I think I prefer 4@S|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|gambit: Presuambly 2C rebid adds some integrity to the @D suit |pg||
nt|dinos1: thk 2@c showed 5-4 in mm's|pg||
nt|gambit: could it be 4-5?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: zaleski table finishes, voices audible from behind the divider as well.  30 on the clock here to finish this est|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|nt|bjacobs: It's an unpleasant contract, but might 4@H be on N/S's way?  Not that it's easily bid|pg||
nt|paulhac:  May be diificult for Claudio to work out pard has 2 spades|pg||
nt|royhughes: The best thing about 1@s is getting the lead, and maybe scaring the opponents out of 3N.  Helgemo certainly didn't want to play|pg||

pc|c8|nt|lml: dont need both of them, just one|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sadek was thinking; helgemo threw CK and S9 on the table|pg||

pc|h5|pc|s5|pg||

nt|dburn: well, this development was not quite what she had in mind|pg||
nt|gambit: given the state of the union too |pg||
nt|jtr: Didnt want to commit with 4|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Dropping the singleton King would bring Strul right back into the match|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: yes, might have ben quite the digit.....|pg||
