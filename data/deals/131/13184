nt|vugraphzef: extended french discussion under the screen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Please tell us, I know you are fluent in French, Simon|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|davidstern: Provided that what is said is repeatable|pg||
nt|benjent: 3NT is makeable on this one ... need to duck a @s, and then play @d's from the top|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: im not close enough to listen and translate roland im afraid :)|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|davidstern: And still need cluib finesse if they switch to hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The end, no?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: Where did Landry find extra values I wonder|pg||
nt|davidstern: He has god three eights|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: Landry: I havent got much - good luck|pg||
nt|benjent: And one of those 8's is going to take a trick|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|davidstern: We all agree with his assessment so all in order|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
nt|davidstern: Given declarer will need the @CK onside to make he should play for singleton diamond honour in East hand|pg||
nt|benjent: I think declarer will wind up trying to endplay East in @s's to lead a @c into the AQ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|dK|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|davidstern: Has managed first hurdle|pg||
nt|benjent: His play is for singleton honour offside or Kx onside|pg||
nt|davidstern: Maybe @DQ by West would have been more interesting|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|davidstern: Low left declarer with no choice|pg||
nt|benjent: Then the late endplay would have been just for fun|pg||
nt|davidstern: As I guess would the queen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is still a chance for declarer to go wrong|pg||
nt|davidstern: If East holds three spades and one club in the end declarer could play him to have bared the club honour|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: Wackwitz back in familiar pose|pg||
nt|benjent: Hand over mouth? |pg||
nt|vugraphzef: yes|pg||
pc|cT|nt|davidstern: As Patrick points out: but West will surely play club now if East has CK. so no end-play.|pg||
nt|benjent: Gotta make sure the flies don't get in. Very disconcerting while you're thinking :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: No choice but to finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, he can postpone that. If the king is onside it will remain onside|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So hopping ace is fine|pg||
nt|davidstern: I have spent my time doing VG commentary with Patrick and I regard him as one of the fineset analysts around|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: now Coudert is hand on head deep in thought - it's a popular pose :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Patrick Huang|pg||
nt|benjent: But East played @sJ at trick 2 - doesn't he look like a man who wants you to play hearts?|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: he also discarded @H9 - and from what ive seen so far it looks like they play udca?|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: not sure what their disc method is though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh, he did not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Simon pulling our legs. Shame on you!|pg||
nt|benjent: Just toying with our emotions :)|pg||

pc|s3|pc|d5|pc|c7|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|benjent: It's actually the same 2 off if the @cK is wrong, but @cA feels better|pg||
mc|9|nt|Walddk2: What if the king is stiff offside. Slender chance, but possible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's why the ace is better|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: no  "bien joue part"" that I could hear :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=76|pg||
nt|szalay: I suppose 2@H was both majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: you can find list of participants, and standings on that site|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: will e/e  steal the contract    n/s can make a lucky 3NT  and make and make a safer contract in diamonds  10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: Israel play stad Israeli, I believe: strong NT, 5 card major, etc.|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: EW play natural, I think|pg||
nt|frankaus: not me  - 4 @S  would tempt me|pg||
nt|frankaus: then i'm a senior|pg||

pc|h6|nt|VugraphPl1: http://michzimny.pl/bridge/2010/pila/gp.html|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 3NT    but hardly bidable|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=80&Itemid=72  for participants |pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW have 9 tricks as the cards are placed, agree.|pg||
nt|szalay: ok, u can drink coffee, he will make it|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: 2@H open room so will be a push|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: do we have running scores Jacco?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: last time i saw Owen in Tri City (West Columbia) sectional, he is 21 y.o., educating in Economics branch in NC State College|pg||
nt|haans: clubs lead?|pg||
nt|haans: best|pg||
nt|ady: even on the lead will go down on a heart switch|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|xenya: well EW can make 6@D|pg||
pc|d2|nt|szalay: after given bidding best trump play (double hook) is even better|pg||
pc|d7|nt|szalay: ok, u can try 6@D, but its terrible...long run I dont suggest slams with 30 hcp and 2 balanced hands|pg||
nt|szalay: bid your games, take your tricks (by Hamman) is good advice in any level|pg||
nt|sybarra: I take it this is the "slam try" sequence |pg||
nt|szalay: with aceless 11, with Qx @C I wd just say 3N, confess|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I think east made a slamtry here, that is what i heard from the explanation from west|pg||
nt|szalay: a bit starnge 3@C rebid except its forcing (doubt it) with 9 top tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: nope it works now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East and West doÂ´nt play the same system here|pg||
nt|haans: not in agrement here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would RD there onstead of 2@d, 2ndly i would definitely start with 1@h|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D show support|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|ady: west should know on the 2 lead that north has 5 clubs|pg||
nt|haans: whappen happened her|pg||
nt|frankaus: 15 2 H in pd major - pd opens - how many will stay short of game?|pg||
nt|haans: non vul yes |pg||
nt|haans: you need 50% to bid game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: my sys card is 2/1 - so it's impossible to stop before game with EW hands|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|szalay: if it was slamtry, West wd accept for sure|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he and his mother Miss Anita are BBO players|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||

pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: and then RD?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: costs nothing to put up the q |pg||
pc|d9|nt|haans: flat board|pg||
nt|ady: cash to clubs puts pressure on west   has to discard a heart   but still down 1|pg||
nt|haans: are they playing Magic Diamond?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|szalay: French pair won Bonn Open Teams (Nations Cup) last year|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ady: would expect 130 to be flat    but you never know|pg||
pc|dA|nt|szalay: personally I wd open West as 2N, if it starts at 20...7 controls, 4 tricks|pg||

nt|ady: othjerwise 11 tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|frankaus: if !K off side even 9 may be hard to come by|pg||
nt|h_karluk: some pairs play support doubles and redoubles, a matter of style|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|haans: Magic Diamond 1@S 8-12 hcp|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|benjent: Oh, random squeeze for the overtrick maybe|pg||
nt|davidstern: Not best lead for defence|pg||

nt|davidstern: Although 9 topies|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  a heart lead would hold this to 9 tricks. now at least 10|pg||
nt|davidstern: That @CJ is gold|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: someone on another laptop just had the sound which bbo makes when it opens up happen - caused all 4 players to share a giggle|pg||
nt|benjent: And the good news is that the lead was only an overtrick. Usually loses, but when it works, it's likely to be the path to beating the contract|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|henryb:  I make the East hand about 22 points, and would be very tempted to bid 2@c - 2@d - 2N|pg||
nt|davidstern: So 6 imps to Neth BLue to place them 6-7 behind|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: it is a mighty fine collection|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All results (including butlers and hand records) at www.nbbportal.nl/1003/ > 'competitie'|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: Dennis already has a good set|pg||
nt|sharkey: :) - the important things Hans|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Director at the table asking Jackson about a score in the previous round|pg||
nt|haans: endplay in hearts possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: last board was 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: sorry for missing the last bid |pg||
nt|h_karluk: np|pg||
nt|szalay: I think West hand is more than 2N|pg||
nt|szalay: East, sry|pg||
nt|ady: J@C   big card in west hand   e/w can make 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: danger of 1@C being passed out|pg||
nt|szalay: I think 1@C is not an option|pg||
nt|sybarra: and stiff A of @C makes the hand easy|pg||
nt|szalay: either 2N or (semi)forcing 2@C/@D|pg||
mb|2N|nt|szalay: what wd u bid over 1@C-1x-?|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|szalay: if u go to normal games: go as fast as u can...dont give them chance to interfere|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably a preemptive @D raise coming |pg||
nt|szalay: why not 4@H with passed pd?|pg||
nt|frankaus: Ax no the best stopper in the world often better played from Qx side|pg||
nt|szalay: slam is unlikely, @H are good, so?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but unlikely to keep e/w out of 4 @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: you had the one with the picture |pg||
nt|sharkey: appears 4@S can be made - however, may have transportation problems|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    n/s may be able to stop in 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the website|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 12 tricks for me....previous hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Peter |pg||
pc|s3|nt|frankaus: looks like a 30 point deck to E |pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far EW 5@c-1 and NS 4@s -1|pg||
nt|szalay: pass with 4 hcp (including a King) very dangerous|pg||
nt|ady: even 2NT opening did not get them to game|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: then we understand|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: and E with 4333....|pg||
nt|szalay: wd u bid 5@D over 1@D-4@H-?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may go 2 @H all pass |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes but that is a blog|pg||
nt|ady: n/s likely to play 2@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would even not try it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Standings after 2 rounds: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=85&Itemid=79|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: after 3 rounds actuallly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but i would rebid 1N as West|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting 1NT|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yuval10: 4@s is some bid by N, P has a very good support though|pg||
nt|yuval10: and now probably bid 5@s ?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Gembick's pass??|pg||
nt|haans: 1n bye North?|pg||
nt|haans: nopåe|pg||
nt|haans: not a nice bid when vul|pg||
nt|sharkey: They've landed in their best strain|pg||
nt|ady: north 2@D rebid very respectable|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: ir 2 @C all pass |pg||
nt|haans: 2@D must be 6-carder|pg||
nt|ady: unfortunately may well go down |pg||
nt|pelu: I would open 2NT (20-21) - over 1@C - 1X I bid 3MT = 15-18 with long @C|pg||
pc|c5|nt|szalay: why not double by South?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2254 and 15|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ady: best spot for n/s is clubs  but unable to get there|pg||
nt|sybarra: a @h lead might not be so pleasant |pg||
nt|ady: may well be a swing for Netherlands|pg||
nt|szalay: in 4N|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|frankaus: traffic light is red pays to be conservative|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well what do I know |pg||
nt|haans: 4@H young bidding|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this time black Kings are not favorably placed|pg||
pc|s7|nt|szalay: e-w gave them all the chance|pg||
nt|xenya: they might get to a hopeless slam now -- and they did|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S?  rkk ? |pg||
nt|szalay: u can beat 5@C if u play some special (lavinthal, roman) signal over A of @S|pg||
nt|haans: E dont fool me|pg||
pc|s9|nt|szalay: I think first step to trap was 1@H...after that they came deeper and deeper|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: seemed like a cuebid auction to me|pg||

nt|sybarra: this site has a picture of the beautiful facility at the White House |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is a reburbished tennis club,  (still active tennis courts)  and a wonder bridge facility |pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: yes agree should be 6 card suit  but AQ to 6 and 2 outside aces is top weight|pg||
pc|d7|pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: and they are playing with screens |pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=31&Itemid=78   standing after round 1|pg||

nt|frankaus: can get it home on this lead|pg||

pc|c6|pg||

nt|ady: defence should prevail |pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|ady: spade lay out bad for declarer|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: the bidding sequence enabled EW to find the defence to 2@H|pg||

nt|frankaus: not easy to switch to 1S|pg||
nt|frankaus: @S|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|ady: cant see any other bidding possible|pg||

nt|ady: this might be down 3|pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks on any lead|pg||

nt|h_karluk: also not hard with @s T9 etc|pg||
pc|cT|nt|haans: best defense|pg||
pc|hT|nt|animeshraj: a low h now!  and h q frm west|pg||
nt|yuval10: 9@d will enable declarer to avoid @d loser|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All results (including butlers and hand records) on www.nbbportal.nl/1003/ > 'competitie'|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h9|nt|h_karluk: @d9 was indeed a slip in defense - either @hJ or small @c would work better|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: if E has @CA and a spade honour, slam is quite good -- perhaps too much to ask for? |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|haans: ruff|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well i didn't get it, sorry, why i am supposed to play 5/2 @s fit? maybe there's still a 5/4 @d fit, so i liked 1NT rebid - just keeps bidding open, i don't think promises a rose ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: garden :)|pg||
nt|pelu: Decl: better play @D first - the @h-suit was locked for defense|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|ady: sorry did not see 2@C bid   but was presumably a transfer to 2@D |pg||

nt|szalay: Frenchmen are very conservative with 4card other major|pg||

mb|4D|an|transfer|nt|h_karluk: uh oh. 1@s ? hmmm :)|pg||

nt|h_karluk: how about pass :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: he already had 3@c in his hand..|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: kibs asking 6@D      can make    but bad contract  |pg||

nt|szalay: important thing after bad boards: leave table for a while and reconnect:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: All Israels I know play drury, maybe west didnt think his hand was good enough\|pg||
nt|ady: club lead will need spades 3-3 to pitch losing club   and heart lead will need king well placed|pg||
nt|sybarra: wrongsided this one|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3nt will make with the   @HJshort|pg||

nt|szalay: trump LEAD does it|pg||

nt|h_karluk: gr8 :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: If Steve Robinson had been here, he would ask "what do you call KQJ98653?"|pg||
nt|henryb:  the problem, imo, is that you are a little strong. You would like to open 4@c to show a strong 4@h bid|pg||

nt|rnmalik: 2@S and @CJ and cross ruff possible|pg||

nt|sharkey: 4@S set with @D shift|pg||

nt|xenya: on 1, the Poles in the other room wound up in 4@H -- strange contract. 11 imps to Israel|pg||

nt|yuval10: 3NT would've been easier here|pg||

nt|szalay: it will makes if trump by opps: no option just staright @C hook|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 20-20 1st time there|pg||
nt|pelu: strong 2@C and positiv response - if East can show 4 controls - easy way to 6|pg||
nt|haans: not me but 1NT = 4 controls|pg||
nt|ady: 4 hearts fails with K@D wrong|pg||
mb|1N|nt|h_karluk: 24-16 again partscore|pg||

nt|szalay: Poles invented 5431-convention|pg||

nt|haans: not 2 aces K = 1 contraol Ace 2|pg||
nt|haans: all may be in @D'|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: jump to 3M means: stiff major, 3card other major|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: (no entry back after ruffing finesse)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|szalay: especially usefull if u open 1N with 5card M|pg||
pc|s7|nt|frankaus: true but transfer then bid game what do u loose?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 1N then 2@s good, so you can play direct 2@s raise 8-10|pg||
nt|haans: x with void can be costly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@c rebid then 2@s rebid, so all pass would also be nice|pg||
pc|s2|nt|szalay: routin 3N is coming|pg||
nt|szalay: so here 1N-3@H-4@S|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6@S as they lay|pg||
nt|pelu: back - with cofee :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|szalay: if no trump lead/switch: he will ruff a @D|pg||
nt|frankaus: now is X pen?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: so 2 @S transfer to minor? |pg||
nt|szalay: but they wont bid with missing ace and trump queen|pg||
nt|pelu: over 4@C and no @D-cue West would know|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@H is a very poor game. It requires more than the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|haans: poerknight: yea but if u hear 4 controls and see 3 kings in ur hand it can only be 2 aces and riye he is|pg||
nt|pelu: so NL on the scoreboard|pg||
pc|d5|nt|h_karluk: i think passive trump lead auto there|pg||
nt|szalay: best defence is: cash 3 winners and @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - West should know pd's loaded; however, with 4 HCP too weak|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and maybe @h3 would give a better idea - say 3/5 leads thoroughout in sys card|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i did not get that 2@h|pg||
pc|dT|nt|szalay: in my book that is a slamtry in M, balanced|pg||
nt|szalay: to lose balanced slamtry with 6bagger is gap, anyway|pg||
nt|yuval10: now declarer can play A and Q@c discarding @s|pg||
nt|szalay: no ruffing finesse is suggested|pg||
nt|szalay: no 100% line, and could be lead from doubleton, but that is the best line, imho|pg||
nt|h_karluk: because you have 2 aces and 3 times trumps, whenever you are in can easily work to cut a ruff|pg||
nt|haans: many do not pen until opps reach game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: while found 5/2 @s fit why he got risk , hard question to reply|pg||
nt|davidb: easy  X  by N  -Ns  at least 6 trumps & more points|pg||
nt|haans: pass on 1nt = balanced hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: F1N not in sys?|pg||
nt|szalay: back...its the most boring set so far|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|xenya: Poland got the 11 imps back quickly, when they stopped in game on 2 (6@H was the contract here) |pg||
nt|ady: north minimum  lacking aces   and wasted K@H  definately should settle for game|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk4: Even on that lead, and with hearts 3-2, it can't make|pg||
pc|s3|nt|szalay: I think South could bid 4@H with 3 aces over 3@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that would help East to see South has only a @h card|pg||
pc|s6|nt|szalay: imagine North has spade Q instead of K of @H|pg||

nt|szalay: btw if South passes and North bids @C a BIT easier, but isnt easy yet|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but makes with a lucky @d hook|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|szalay: I think North can double 4@S quite confidently|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|hawe45:  Dangerous double - no defence against 4 @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: I like Dbl instead of 2@S - EW lost the whole 1 level thus they end up in this hopeless contract|pg||

nt|xenya: np Jacco|pg||
nt|szalay: btw with bare KQ I suggest to take fist with King..but: if pd doesnt continue after Q-K: doesnt have more|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A void in every second board or so|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and 5-0 break, just 4 %|pg||
nt|haans: sad really|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's the penultimate board and huge difference|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I'm strung between seeing Andy (Hung) win, since he's a good friend and see my team lose... Hmmmmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: EW have a lucky make in 5@D - limiting @D losers to 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: in my humble opinion this level of the play is not good at U20 yet|pg||
nt|frankaus: -470 is not a good number on a scoresheet|pg||
nt|szalay: I think at least 8 serious mistakes in 8 bds|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20 again   no fit    |pg||
nt|ady: whoever plays likely to go down|pg||
nt|yuval10: very quick session it was|pg||
nt|pelu: a @d-lead set up @DJ to discard for a major-loser|pg||
nt|ady: must have slipped in defence to let 3@C through|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, i do not see any reason to begin with 3@c at 1st seat|pg||
nt|pelu: but defense could still kill @dJ by ruff|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead may set up J@D  but that can beruffed out when west wins ace of clubs|pg||
nt|haans: but why do N wait|pg||
nt|haans: easy pass|pg||
nt|pelu: with screen we often have 2 bids a time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: when you use a preempt at 3 level at 1st seat that's only against economy of space principle|pg||
nt|pelu: so it could be East in problem|pg||
nt|haans: pass all|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ady: this has esculated|pg||
nt|haans: but 4@S a make 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: the hand got rotated|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think i would prefer 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: would u bid 3@D?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: why not|pg||
nt|haans: if u pass 3@C sitting west can you miss game then?|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: operator, undo?|pg||
nt|haans: sry :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: 2@D: NF (std Polish approx.)|pg||
nt|pelu: with a better @h-suit u could open 1@H but not with J high|pg||
nt|sybarra: just another "exciting" hand|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|szalay: 3@C was @S raise|pg||
nt|sybarra: undoubled, that is good news |pg||
nt|ady: even undoubled  east west will lose several imps|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yuval10: OR led @d, let's see if they'll lead it again here|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps will opt to a @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems bidding directions are wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: nono, I bid correctly|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Only 180 degrees|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: cards are wrong. North is dealer but east has the west cards etc|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not me|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think N would buy to 2@s|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: doomed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Rotten suit|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: north and south also switched cards|pg||
nt|pelu: spects : 9-1 for pass :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Kib avg age, Peter? :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i cannot use a double there because of @s Ax, i know the ovecall suit quality is not bright there |pg||
nt|haans: very like bidding prempt after prempt |pg||
nt|ady: this will be a slaughter|pg||
nt|haans: you just dont do that|pg||
nt|sybarra: and its j high with no good spots!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|h_karluk: to me good lead, could cost worse to a @d lead|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sharkey: the players probably took the wrong cards out|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: nope they all took their own slot|pg||
nt|sharkey: score 33-0 to Denmark and more to come...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|szalay: I confess I could pass as East automatically|pg||
nt|szalay: over 1@C|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|sybarra: may make 6 now |pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: too much technical stuff for me, i only know on/off button and how to use a mouse :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: you're advanced Hamdi...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: omg, after long years i learnt to use email system:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What is e-mail...?|pg||
nt|sharkey: ask Hamdo hans :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: ik heb een geheel gedraaid spel. Kan je een arbiter roepen?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hamdi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: at start i thought, some guy's name in Venezuala, bcos i saw a video abt it |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: tell oops was trying to contact someone else in the building|pg||
pc|h4|nt|frankaus: pass is the hardest bid to master in bridge :)|pg||
nt|szalay: light openings and overcalls they style can live cause another side|pg||
nt|ady: heart shift  best|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no other choice I think|pg||
nt|ady: hand 16 where west was down 1 in 4@H doubled   in OR  n/s made 4@D re-doubled|pg||
nt|ady: was 11 imps for world team|pg||
nt|rnmalik: compensation here for NS might gain some|pg||
nt|pelu: 4 out of 5 : I am junior :):)|pg||
nt|haans: psych|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could also play for divided @d honours|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems preferred 3-3 35/6 %|pg||
nt|haans: 4th 5th spade|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sharkey: we can follow jacco - just finsih the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: true but the other table played the hand it was supposed to be played|pg||
nt|sharkey: Makes on low @C lead...|pg||
nt|haans: opinion: gronkvist: they must cancel the board gronkvist: will the laws says so|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|szalay: u wont punish for light openings cause light overcalls and vica versa|pg||
nt|szalay: why not to take @C in hand?|pg||
nt|szalay: to start @D ruff?|pg||
nt|frankaus: maybe planning on a dummy reversal|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: he may be thinking same thing,  maybe played too fast |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Now they're all saying I'm junior to me :P|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzeg: I could led the right guy lead but he led small club|pg||
pc|c4|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I love how 3/10 are people I know|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @d K ?? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yep|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pelu: the problem are not 13-14 HCP - but the bad suit|pg||
pc|d9|nt|h_karluk: ok sir, thanks :)|pg||

mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|davidstern: Simon arent you away from home|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here too would you believe|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|henryb:  4@h is the only game that makes|pg||
nt|davidstern: Is 2@C better than negative double by North|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|benjent: 4@h is ok, 3NT and 5@c not so much|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|davidstern: 3NT Would be OK if West held one heart honour|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you think you are strong enough to force to game, I prefer 2@C. If not, double|pg||
nt|davidstern: Happy to be in game if we have a fit or sdpade stoppers so a little unknown|pg||
pc|s7|nt|benjent: Not really - East wins the 1st @h and pumps a 2nd @s through|pg||
pc|s8|nt|henryb:  I spoke too soon. but West till have to shift to a @d to beat this|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|henryb:  Given what they open, I think forcing to game is a little much|pg||
nt|davidstern: East has to be awake to that if holding @HKx...|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: Wackwitz in the same pose now as he was after T1 last deal |pg||
nt|benjent: Difficult defence ... can West figure out he needs to play a @d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: The French are generally much sounder opening bidders than many of the other nations, even at junior level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He knows he must not continue spades|pg||
nt|davidstern: I thi nk he knows he has to switch so |pg||
nt|Walddk2: The 8 was discouraging|pg||
nt|davidstern: I will bet he plays a @D|pg||
pc|d2|nt|benjent: Heart switch would be crazy, and @c switch looks wrong ... so maybe|pg||
nt|davidstern: There you go|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: if he does maybe shld play Q?|pg||
nt|benjent: scratch that, definitely!|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|henryb:  should at least lead @d10|pg||
nt|davidstern: Oh very brave of you AFTER HE DOES IT|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|benjent: And Simon makes a good point - South looks like a man with AJx 5@h 3-4@c and therefore 1-2@d|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|benjent: If he has @dJx or just @dJ, he's going to run the little @d anyway, so might as well play for something that works|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|h9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Flawless defence, well done boys|pg||

nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!|pg||
nt|szalay: does West have way to show @D lead?|pg||
nt|szalay: or may be HIS lead, even better:)|pg||
nt|ady: if west is on lead to 3NT  may choose a heart when east has shown majors|pg||
nt|szalay: a bit optimistic, but acceptable 5@C|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 7/5/1 long time not seen|pg||
nt|haans: 1@C mbs?|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@s in OR = 5 card @S + a minor|pg||
mb|d|nt|h_karluk: thanks all, esp fellow commentators & operator|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are back in about 1/2 hour |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes play went very fast here so that is why|pg||
nt|szalay: fast play seldom means good|pg||
nt|frankaus: fine operating Jacco <clap> <clap> <clap> <clap>|pg||
nt|szalay: I think South has INV with @Cs, lets say 3@C is normal or 2N...|pg||
nt|pelu: by West|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: it was west thinking but i try to do 2 bids at a time|pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks like it should make |pg||
nt|szalay: r u sure?|pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder|pg||
nt|szalay: 1@S, 1@H and how many @Cs?|pg||
nt|ady: looks like west has mis understood partners bid|pg||
nt|szalay: its Molenaar's double session|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: west might have explained this as weak with @d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: imho 5@c unbelievable|pg||
nt|haans: 3 down in 5@Cx|pg||
nt|haans: 2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C is not an overbid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could any lead a trump from QT - say to 5 clubs contract? :)|pg||
nt|haans: 3@Dx|pg||
mb|d|nt|h_karluk: possibly 3@s would come|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: I think its going down for @S lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes!!  here we go again|pg||
nt|szalay: 6@C for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: East wasnt passing, I could tell you that|pg||
nt|xenya: E seems to have taken partner's 4@C too seriously|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what would you lead vs 5@c ? @h A/K or @s A+x ? :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT the easiest as they lay    but likely to play 5@C  which would certainly go down to a trump lead   4@H can make|pg||
nt|haans: at last|pg||
mb|3C|nt|yuval10: E likes his hand|pg||
nt|haans: game at or|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i do not believe my eyes, 4261 with 6 hcp and 3@d 3rd seat both nonvul :)|pg||
nt|davidb: not a  lucky decision |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: dbl gazzili like bid?|pg||
nt|ady: not likely to play 4@H|pg||
nt|frankaus: have you heard my view on playing 5 minor contracts?|pg||
nt|ady: managed 3NY OR|pg||
nt|ady: OR|pg||
nt|h_karluk: esp when N showed his interest on unbid suits (the reds)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry there were a huge misjudgement|pg||
nt|sybarra: might we try 3 @C now?|pg||
nt|pelu: ther5e are 8 "top" tricks - but not when u take @cK (see the 10) and run @cJ :(|pg||
nt|ady: must have got club position wrong in OR  to go so badly down in 3NT     low club and when 10 appeared went up with king and finessed 9|pg||
nt|pelu: 0,1 sec late, David :)|pg||
nt|ady: yes    you are too quick for me Peter|pg||
mb|3S|nt|szalay: if u travel across the World, better to agree 2suiter overcalls|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: the problem was the semi natural 1@c openingbid i think|pg||
nt|szalay: if a bid (semi)natural, better to treat it as natural, eg. to play (1m)-2m as Michaels vs. prepared 1m yet|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to misguess hts here also |pg||
nt|h_karluk: obviously - east players happy with that 7 hcp|pg||
nt|yuval10: maybe too much for a 4-3-3-3 hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: but grand slam try with missing ace was a mistake, anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 1430, I guess|pg||
nt|xenya: admittedly, he does have a great hand|pg||
nt|szalay: nbo pressure for N-S now|pg||
nt|szalay: the real issue is 3m is nat or stopper asking|pg||
nt|haans: not to happy with @H lead|pg||
nt|ady: in what   4@H?|pg||
nt|haans: nt|pg||
nt|frankaus: its like kissing your own sister - even when its right ---- its hard to get excited about your prospects|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|szalay: time for @S switch yet, and likely 2 off|pg||
nt|szalay: c u in 30 minutes|pg||
nt|szalay: byebye|pg||
nt|pelu: now 25-0 could be 25-24!|pg||
nt|haans: hung is trying to show his strength|pg||
nt|ady: yes Netherlands good comeback|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If he thinks he has that strong a hand, why did he not reverse into 2@H?|pg||
nt|ady: well the 2 club rebid did not exactly convey the hand|pg||
nt|haans: his opinion for a long time|pg||
nt|davidb: to leave the X . 3D  is ok for  juniors openings|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: thanks, you interpreted my feelings :)|pg||
nt|szalay: it will be push, thx all, c u soon|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thx buddy, c ya soon|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: once again holy ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a-ha North pushes his opps to game|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@C er helt ude i hampen|pg||
nt|frankaus: may escape  with -2|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: south asking west what double means|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: west doesnt have a real clue|pg||
nt|sybarra: how about "I think we can beat the contract"  as an answer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And they can|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Sac vs 3@H?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there were a passed hand double and imho showed @h+@d|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem is that the X from = @H, so 2@h is what??|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe that's too simple|pg||
nt|haans: we have said neither|pg||
nt|pelu: so play: X = dont lead @s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: but will they?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: this stands no chance of course -- let's see if he can get out for -1|pg||
nt|ady: high spade likely lead|pg||
nt|pelu: some play after opp has shown 2 suits, that a bid here is sopper and no stopper in the other suit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hope they make postmortem especially about this board|pg||
nt|sybarra: ht lead spade thru?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk4: sorry for speaking Danish|pg||
nt|h_karluk: makeable now|pg||
nt|haans: small @D????????????????|pg||
nt|ady: win and duck a heart  will make|pg||
nt|ady: I think this may be down 1   so -200  will gain against 400 OR|pg||
nt|sybarra: or now,  of @S, H! switch,  spade thru?|pg||
nt|pelu: in S some play RD = I am not sure we sh play 3Nt and Pass = OK with me|pg||
pc|s7|nt|frankaus: bed time here back latter in day european time|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes this happened, north couldnt play south for 4@D|pg||
nt|xenya: i doubt that -- W's clubs are too small|pg||
nt|xenya: setting up @Ds would mean seetting up trump tricks for N|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu frank @H |pg||
nt|xenya: but i overlooked the fact that the defence had presented E with a trick -- now he certainly can make 11 and must be thinking how to get 12  |pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: can establish spades    but has no trump control|pg||
nt|h_karluk: !k was the lead i expected|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h K|pg||
nt|sharkey: Actually first time the Danes made a "crazy" bid this match I think|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West must switch to a diamond, heart not good enough|pg||
