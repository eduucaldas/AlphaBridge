nt|Vugraphzfe: sorry don't recognize NS pair will get names ASAP|pg||

nt|jtr: Broge and Sals back together|pg||
nt|chmitty: not tonight sry|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh !|pg||
nt|jtr: That changed qyuickly!|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is first of 4 16 bd. sessions |pg||
nt|sybarra: a long day for playeres |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: welcome, both pairs are standard, strong nt and few artificial sequences other than transfer lebensohl by strul|pg||
nt|jtr: And us!|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Philip :) |pg||
mb|1S|nt|chick: that's good to know :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Routine 3NT to start one would imagine|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dinos1: hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: welcome to the quarter finals, all have done well to arrive at this point |pg||
mb|3N|nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi all and welcome to the 4th segment of the Quarterfinals of the Vanderbilt|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Hey Sergey :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: Cornelia :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: with soft values and strong short suits better not ask majors|pg||
nt|chick: 9 tricks available after knocking out a couple of aces, and NS have no long suit to set up|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Prakash|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rodal f: Hi Cam and specs|pg||
nt|gambit: One might expect N/S to swing a little, down by 50....maybe we will see some fireworks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness explaining their methods: open lowest with more than 1 4-card suit|pg||
nt|jtr: North can duck 2 @ss to worry declarer|pg||
nt|jtr: But 9 always|pg||
pc|sK|nt|stewball: hi everyone|pg||
nt|chick: HI John :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: hi John|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: caught up now.  board 1 is always chaos|pg||
nt|panja: hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: clubs come tumbling home  |pg||
pc|s6|nt|panja: This will be on lead..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness: how many spades? six spades|pg||
nt|jtr: un everything it seems|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3@h and 2x3 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: and @H k marked  |pg||
nt|jtr: Nice duck anyway  9 for technical merit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jtr: oh unducked?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|dinos1: now low @d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sadek finally turns the trick, still thinking|pg||
nt|gambit: I was on VuG last night when E/W played very well and knocked off the  1 seed Nickel, they are very tough |pg||
nt|rodal f: 17 -32 aint up but score after 1 segment: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm|pg||
nt|sybarra: apparently unducked |pg||
nt|jtr: reducked|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sunsamvar: what else can south lead? maybe he can try @CA|pg||
nt|sybarra: or redacted as the case may be |pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|nt|xenya: great bid by Helness -- 4@S stands no chance|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Christer Kristoffersen and Martin Johnson|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: NS carding upside-down|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good day folks|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: hello to both :)|pg||
nt|stoffers: hi all|pg||
nt|jtr: Welcome Martin and Christer|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sry, asked players to not shield cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: and these 4 should know that |pg||
pc|hT|nt|jtr: one sometimes forgets|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|dburn: well, collecting that third heart may be problematic|pg||
nt|dinos1: dcl may set @d now|pg||
nt|chick: now that he used up his @D entry, will have to play on diamonds instead|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||
nt|dburn: I am not sure, but I think that "she" may be the right pronoun for this declarer|pg||
nt|dinos1: now needs to guess|pg||
nt|chick: so I'm being told :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: yes, it's Carolyn Lynch|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|chick: thanks :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: so strange having bandwidth and players not rushing to beat the clock|pg||
nt|jtr: Elemnts there for a double squeeze but the count is not corrected|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|harmon: Hi all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably will cash out|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: don't speak too soon|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|stoffers: J@h will get covered|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, he will try the @hJ|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|dinos1: dcl can make if guess location of @sA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: carolyn offered to lose a diamond and a club, passell said she ought to play it out|pg||
nt|dinos1: or cd make if play on @d's|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Vugraphzfe: but @D not crashing|pg||
pc|dT|nt|fabsayc: but if you have all winners you probably should not cover|pg||
nt|jtr: Now South will have to pitch the @s|pg||
nt|jtr: And the @h finesse is safe|pg||
pc|d7|nt|fabsayc: pitch heart|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not safe|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|hA|mc|12|nt|fabsayc: although maybe strul needed heart for opener|pg||
pg||

nt|bjacobs: Which is that the Vanderbilt is essentially a stronger event than any of the world championships (except maybe the open Rosenblum Cup)|pg||
nt|gambit: I looked it up this morning, our finalists are from the original seeding  11 (Fleisher),12 (Strul), 15 (De Knijft) and 16 (Zimmerman)  great job to advance to the round of 4 |pg||
mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: both matches playing the same boards -- if you want to spy try http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   [one window per table]|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3N|nt|bjacobs: World Championships being restricted by country and/or zone|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Fleisher +65 vs Diamond and de Knijff +46 vs Zaleski. Lynch has withdrawn against Strul|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|gambit: That 2@s  bid really slowed down W |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: For your interest, see http://www.acbl.org/nabc/rosters/2010/01/VANDPRS/ for the entries|pg||
nt|ady: little problem    9 easy tricks  and 10  if taking heart finesse|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hT|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: EW defensive carding is standard count but upside-down attitude|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Fleisher +65 vs Diamond and de Knijff +46 vs Zaleski. Lynch has withdrawn against Strul|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: halftime: fleisher 142-diamond 42, de kniff 111-zaleski 56|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Roland and Vladimir|pg||
nt|panja: Usually, the third seat preempt is 'wide range' and is expected to bother opps..but here, it likely helped them|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: walid: what was your shape?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: seemed better to pitch a club on the third heart, then play a spade|pg||
mb|1D|nt|dinos1: better to play @s to J and set 5th @d|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thxto Wayne:) Here u are the score after segment 2: http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2010/01/vanderbilt/|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: strul 151-lynch 51, and zimmermann 96-onstott 41|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: er, strul 131-lynch 51|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last night we tried something with one commentator seeing only 1 hand|pg||
nt|stoffers: EW dont want to get to high in @d here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|jtr: Oh?|pg||
mb|d|nt|gambit: Huge lead for Strul, hopefully this match will become a little closer, adds to the flavour |pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: 100% line coz def didnt lead @c to that moment|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: this is a fair slam, but again the play is not straightforward|pg||
nt|dburn: and nor is the bidding - not quite sure what Passell intends here|pg||
nt|jtr: Might pass even facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|jtr: He did|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am now sitting east, will try not to seem too stupid|pg||
nt|jtr: Hellness considering 2@d|pg||
nt|jtr: And Martin i guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1nt looks normal with the scattered cards|pg||
nt|stoffers: yes, but he also knows south has short @d and Geir didnt run so cant be that good|pg||
nt|jtr: I think he will pass eventually|pg||
nt|jtr: We just have to live long enough to see it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: nobody really knows here but i trust partner and pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: could his pard only have 3 @D? |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: no doubt 4@d is Blackwood for clubs, but...|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@d was? @crkcb?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: I will forward any explanations I can read or overhear|pg||
nt|dburn: ...that seems a little odd with no control in either of the unbid suits|pg||
nt|chick: I'm told by a spec that it is a transfer to hearts, not sure if that is true or not :)|pg||
nt|stoffers: no, 4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no, 4 card majors|pg||
nt|jtr: Voila as they say in Canada|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Vugraphzfe: NS play 1@C could be 2 if 4432, so 1@D is always real diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: no, e/w open 4 card suits or better|pg||
nt|sybarra: and poor Becker can not even lead a @D |pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is terrifying|pg||
nt|stoffers: 3@s NS in open i hear|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok just checking did not have cc up |pg||
nt|stoffers: 1@d-1NT-2@d majors|pg||
nt|stoffers: isntead of double|pg||
nt|stoffers: well, how will 1NTx do folks?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you folks are telling me the diamonds are a dead end, but dont see anything else to try|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: e/w west also open lower of 4 card suits ie 1H with 4 s's and 4h's|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: well, North will be confident at this point|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: twas passell thinking there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness quits fidgeting with his pencil and leans over the table to examine dummy|pg||
nt|gambit: the lead looks terrifying from W perspective|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps i should cash hearts first |pg||
pc|h4|nt|dburn: whether confident enough to double, we will discover|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: el ahmady in a hurry to push the tray after !4C; helness slows him down and alerts.  writing explanations on both sides of screen|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|d8|nt|dinos1: 1@c was strong so ...|pg||
nt|stewball: attack|pg||
pc|h2|nt|warrens:  Becker's too wise to double.  if they ran, his partner would have to guess what suit to lead against 7@C|pg||
nt|stewball: very curious|pg||
nt|dburn: he cannot be sure of beating 7@c, so he will probably let it go|pg||
nt|dinos1: if dbl 6N then 7@c by E and what to lead? :)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
nt|panja: 2Nt is BAL or short H....if BAL, Helgemo has reason to think @H contract will be better..|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|jtr: Passive seems best|pg||
pc|s8|nt|panja: not the best lead..trump would have restricted to 4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 4@C = cue bid; 4@S = short @H|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jtr: Both getting somewhat active|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chick: any old A will do :)|pg||

nt|fabsayc: club back i am down 2|pg||

mb|1D|mb|2C|nt|gambit: look like 1NT|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: now alerting one diamond|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fredin-Fallenius 1@D open = 4+ unbal  [or 3rd seat lead director]|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: This looks like a simple 4@S, with the trump lead holding down the overtricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|ady: 50's|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room Weinstein in East playing 1NX|pg||
pc|h9|nt|gambit: a 4-2 fit, blown out of the 4-4 by the overcall |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: does this qualify as automatic trump lead auction|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: On this auction, I think the trump is strongly suggested|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't ask Bill|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Trump is mandatory|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You have diamonds sitting over East ...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i was asking Bill|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I lead a trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bill never lead trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: leds or led|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bjacobs: I am so misunderstood :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: In the other room East did not bid diamonds, so he got that lead|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|gambit: N sure to be endplayed (in NT) a couple times.....tough to get out of the way |pg||
nt|ahollan1: without interference Fallenius 2@C shows 6-11 with @C & @D  -- not sure if that applied after 1@D overcall|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: 1@D not alerted by Passell but Strul shows two fingers and Passell nods|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bergen raise|pg||
nt|jtr: Shitty opening in that position|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gambit: a desperate S will bid 4, a disciplined one  - not so sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes north could cash diamond and south pitch the spade loser|pg||
nt|sybarra: "any 11"  ?|pg||

nt|jtr: Apart from that it is fine|pg||
nt|stoffers: 4@s??|pg||

nt|jtr: 5@c?|pg||

nt|fabsayc: double|pg||

nt|rodal f: Helness and Helgemo are that stabil that NS don't even think abough 4@H|pg||
nt|lml: hey Harmon |pg||
nt|gambit: what a balance!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: immediate 3@S, apparently had decided to balance over 3@H while Sadek had the tray|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 6@D makes because of the lucky lie of the red suits|pg||
nt|stoffers: if im having a misunderstanding like that dummy comes 1363 and queens and jacks :)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|dinos1: 2@d - GF checkback|pg||
nt|xenya: on 49, the bidding in OR was entirely different -- S opened 1@C (not 3@C as here) and it was W who preempted with 3@S -- no wonder EW stayed out of game |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|dburn: this is not the worst 6@d in the world, and it will make on this lie of cards, but bidding it will be quite a feat|pg||
nt|dinos1: one more minor slam|pg||
nt|dinos1: now 2N - 3@d?|pg||
nt|dburn: especially since up to now, diamonds have not actually been bid at all|pg||
nt|dburn: if East bids 3@d now, they have some sort of chance, but...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: lynch folds her hand, crosses her arms, looks at her cards again|pg||
nt|gambit: double |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Vugraphzfe: helness can sniff helgemo's stiff @H on the bidding|pg||
nt|panja: 4@s a nice spot..|pg||
nt|panja: once again trump lead will be the best for defence|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dburn: ...well, she bid it|pg||
nt|panja: Decl will likely take the A, discards, and xruf|pg||
nt|stoffers: is becker alowed to pass this if partner has 5+ 5+ diamonds and spades?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps club king lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dinos1: well - W has good hand for pd|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: kibitzer asks Passell for permission to sit behind him - normally no one bothers to ask|pg||
nt|dinos1: side aces and KJ in trump suit|pg||
nt|stewball: and a legit @d suit|pg||
nt|dburn: not clear what 3@h is - 4@d would have been clearer to East, but Passell may intend to support diamonds at a later stage|pg||
nt|dinos1: @sJ wd be golden )|pg||
nt|stewball: i think 3@h is a punt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: carolyn still working it out|pg||
nt|dburn: Lynch not clear what it is either - if I were West it would show worry about clubs for 3NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: strul examining EW system card|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3@s now, no?|pg||
nt|dburn: but in any case East seems to have a 3@s bid and let the chips fall|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. Would have payed|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dinos1: now 4@c|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: yes, seems to cover all possibilities|pg||
nt|harmon: back to a ht and 4th d|pg||
nt|harmon: oops|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness leans over the table for a closer look at @CK|pg||
nt|gambit: I would too...........|pg||
nt|rodal f: If u take those two payers I put my money at Helness. A teambuilder and a sniffing nose better then the most of us.|pg||
nt|lml: it is an awlward card though|pg||
nt|gambit: Fabulous players, with the nose(s) of a bloodhound|pg||
nt|lml: this is a link for the half time scores http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2010/01/vanderbilt/|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: walid looking around, slightly impatient.  Sadek sitting back in his chair looking calm|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: and helgemo is always stoic|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|dburn: no doubt Passell intends that as keycard for diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: but I confess that if I were East, the whole thing would be a complete mystery to me|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: strul writing a question then puts his pen on top so I can't read|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if East can work it out the final contract will be 6@d, but if she can't, there is the horrid possibility that it might be 4@h|pg||
nt|dinos1: I was await 4@c cue, but 4@h - it's above me|pg||
nt|chick: have to admit, I'd figure W for a lot of hearts right about now|pg||
nt|dinos1: mb it's @d rkcb? :)|pg||
nt|dburn: I ma sure that it is, but East is not sure at all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: the alerted 4@D previously and alerted 4@H here suggest EW are playing kickback over minors|pg||
nt|dinos1: but why E is thinking so long?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: but now that you mention it, I didn't see lynch alert 4@H when the tray came through|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: NS both holding their cards below the table and looking down|pg||
nt|chick: I wonder if they are using the old rule that says cards have to be played on the same day they are dealt?  :)|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a tough position for Carolyn Lynch - the spectators all know what West's bidding means, and so do North, South, West and I|pg||

nt|chick: does this count for sominex coup?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: strul gestures like he can't believe what's going on|pg||

nt|ady: 6@C   for e/w|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mrdct: or ruff a @H! if you aren.t in NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 1 club alert|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+  [2@C would cover 20-21 BAL]|pg||
nt|gambit: poor S squeezed with his whopping 3 count |pg||
mb|p!|nt|mrdct: undo that - need the squeeze|pg||
nt|gambit: both so balanced, not surprised to see 3NT (or more NT) as the final contract|pg||
nt|mrdct: obviously i just got of bed - in 6@C you can of course pitch a @D on a @H and ruff a @D provide trumps behave|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+@S    1N=17-19 BAL     eventually|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|gambit: perhaps Bjorn plays them better....|pg||

nt|harmon: this was not the hand for it tho|pg||
nt|panja: @SAKx is good.....but the values in the side suits don't really point to a suit contract...so perhaps S should have preferred a 1nt rebid second time, but as the cards are, 4@S ...|pg||

nt|xenya: even for Helgemo|pg||

nt|mrdct: however, with a correct guess in @C you do have 8 tricks and a 9th make come if douth leads a @S or a long @D can get setup - problem for the defence is north never gets in to lead ...|pg||

nt|lml: slam is not that bad although it wont make|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anysac to come? Belive not|pg||
nt|harmon: I like anysacs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: united nations in here.  23 europeans, these two egyptians, and 22 U.S residents playing in the round of 8|pg||
nt|rodal f: U do::)|pg||
nt|lml: interesting more non US than US|pg||
nt|harmon: and Timo here too so friggin truckers represented|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sadek still evaluating his hand|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|gambit: hope not 2@C as that might lead (vs. 6 ) to a lead directing, killing dble|pg||
nt|stoffers: some player double in N ther, bidding diamonds cheap and now showing extras|pg||
nt|reisig: I'd never Pass w 2 aces - there|pg||

nt|stoffers: now*|pg||
nt|stoffers: no t|pg||
mb|p|nt|stoffers: jez|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: was 2NT nat or Jacoby ?|pg||
nt|lml: if they were thinking of slam than the club bid should turn them off|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzfe: not natural, alerted, but I don't have the explanation|pg||
nt|gambit: why not dble vs 3NT?|pg||
nt|lml: Sadek now knows he has a club loser|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dinos1: had position for W - doesnt know what suit is longer|pg||
nt|stewball: pretty good stop here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: becker: he has at least 7 points and at least 3 hearts|pg||
nt|lml: unless it is not clubs|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Must know his partner Rich!|pg||
nt|sybarra: W sort of an aceless wonder type hand |pg||

nt|reisig: Seems so|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@D=slamtry|pg||
nt|gambit: must try 4@H|pg||
nt|lml: is there any kind of play for 6NT?  The wrong hand has the diamond ace for a throw in|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sadek rolls his neck, then leans forward - about as much body language as you'll see from him|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: walid fanning his cards on the table|pg||
nt|gambit: after the 4C bid, best to lie low |pg||
nt|gambit: 4@H/4@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive Harmon agree with u Cam.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness yawns again.  I wonder if these players suffer from jet lag, 9+ hours behind their home time zone|pg||
nt|lml: I think a heart lead will prevent 6NT|pg||
nt|gambit: of course South might have cause to imagine his partner's diamonds to be MUCH better|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Vugraphzfe: walid stops examining his hand and leans forward to examine dummy more closely|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dinos1: now @c - then =|pg||
nt|lml: but that will be the normal lead|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dinos1: this is +2|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lml: yes you are all right.  Anything but a heart it can be made on a double squeeze|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: starting with round of 16 the vanderbilt is played with screens which run diagonally across the table so players cannot see their partners mannerisms|pg||
nt|gambit: tempting to try, thaat 4D bid was sedductive, let's see if he can resist|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: during the auction the boards are passed back and forth through a curtain.  after the auction a window is opened so all players can see one another's played cards and the dummy|pg||
nt|harmon: not i cant as lomg as E retains Jxx of hts|pg||
nt|dinos1: wonder - at all 4 tables 4@h+3 was played (b.38)|pg||
nt|gambit: Imagine Akxxxx xx Akx xx |pg||
nt|lml: I think that South should discount the @CQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sadek still contemplating his next call|pg||
nt|rodal f: Just for fun. If N had 3@H and single @C by a 6NTS|pg||
nt|gambit: and the 4@D call, that was inflammatory |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness clears his throat for the hundredth time and riffles his cards.  seems impatient|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helgemo looks like he could sit in that posture forever|pg||
nt|rodal f: There way to be John:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: one arm across his chest, other elbow on his wrist, scratching his chin|pg||
nt|lml: the way you have to make it in 6NT assuming no heart lead is actually a kind of strip squeeze|pg||
nt|lml: you have to play a diamond from dummy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Helgemo by the pokerface and Helness the former world champ at poker|pg||
nt|lml: East has to duck|pg||
nt|lml: then you run all your winners and West has to hold three clubs (and therefore two hearts)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: you cash the hearts and throw him in|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I wonder if they would have bid 4 vulnerable?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: so that is our fairy tale for today|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: the time "limit" is 150 minutes for 16 boards|pg||
nt|harmon: cant east keep Jxx of hts??|pg||
nt|gambit: If Helgemo doubled  - would that say don't lead my suit?|pg||
nt|lml: no because then you dont cash the hearts|pg||
nt|lml: you play club club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: but enforcement is difficult because often both sides are at fault|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|lml: its a five card ending|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: moss-gitelman/fleisher-kamil fell far behind on time in Q1 then rushed to catch up|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: in Q2, lynch-passell took ages for the first few boards, then took a walk to shake off a disaster|pg||

mb|3S|nt|gambit: Fleisher if given the room (to show 3H constructive)  will|pg||
nt|mrdct: but non vul opposite a 10-13 limited opener and only a known 6-2 fit game doesn't appear too likely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S blocking|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This is a lot more interesting than the usual commentary, says a spectator|pg||
nt|hlortz: thats the fascination of the game even world class players cant play double dummy... 'errors' are prevalent|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did I open a can of worms I wonder|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Maybe "I" should have opened 2@D (they play weak 2s in diamonds, i think)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Too wild, perhaps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might lose a lot of commentators if the spectators demand we use only one eye|pg||
nt|gambit: double now?|pg||

nt|gambit: going to check on the kids in the room next door?|pg||
nt|mrdct: this will be a timely board for dekniff as it's been one-way traffic so far|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: well @H made 10 tricks in the closed room - so some hope for fleisher here|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|panja: and 3Nt is a never never spot because N hand does not have an entry|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: sadek still planning|pg||

mb|p!|nt|Walddk2: I promise not to tell that South has less spades than you|pg||

nt|mrdct: no problems in 3NT here - but should north be getting involved in teh auction at these colours with 5-5 in the reds?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: lots of writing|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: maybe he wants to show short spades?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be 3@s giving shortness in @h to not give the possibility to dbl at opps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe they use steps for shortness|pg||
nt|mrdct: fredin having vague thoughts of a slam in @C?|pg||

mb|3N|nt|gambit: Bjorn, 3NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: that incline must be one heck of a tilt|pg||

nt|fabsayc: the crux is does 3@S show a truely solid suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Except maybe this one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @D10 is an entry :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: if West can't reopen impossible to have 12 tricks - right bid 3NT|pg||

nt|gambit: 10 toppers|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: As Pierre Schmidt points out, West will have to give the entry later anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: how did 4@S go down 2 in closed room|pg||

mb|5H|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: both sides playing like they believe the match is out of reach|pg||

nt|dinos1: @s or @h? :)|pg||
nt|stewball: but why shld  lead a @h instead of a @s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: it was five cards earlier - helgemo was 5-5 in the reds|pg||
nt|reisig: 7@s may be -1|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Well bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: lucky as the cards are  7 nt,  but perfer 7 @S at imps|pg||
nt|jtr: Indeed Richie|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dinos1: @s spots are much better)|pg||
nt|panja: and now, Declarer has enough entries to Dummy to bring in play the long Clubs|pg||
nt|reisig: This lead kills the dbl squeeze too|pg||
nt|jtr: Now that has broken up the double squeeze|pg||
nt|jtr: Touche:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: a hungry double would have worked well|pg||
nt|dinos1: @d10?|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: click click click click pff pff pff pff, flipping his played tricks one under the other|pg||
nt|lml: it might be hard to figure out that he should play for the spade ruff|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sunsamvar: or ruff a @D|pg||
nt|xenya: but this hand could produce a double game swing for Onstott -- in theory|pg||
pc|s7|nt|dinos1: now @s back and?|pg||
nt|dinos1: must play @sA|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|stewball: not such a hard play|pg||
nt|dburn: well, first declarer must play a diamond - the @d9 is normal, in case of @dJ10 with North|pg||
nt|dinos1: if duck @s - quick @h switch will beat|pg||
nt|stewball: even a slow @h switch|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: strul rearranges his hand then folds it again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: examines dummy and selects|pg||
nt|lml: good for him|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: @DJ may have pointed the way|pg||
nt|lml: true|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: walid sitting with hands clasped in front of his face|pg||
nt|stoffers: best line here after discovering spades 3-1?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Could North get careless and discard a heart?|pg||
nt|jtr: One down next door|pg||
nt|reisig: NO!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: dont have entries for 2 heart finesses|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Well, he had|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes a trump was led|pg||

nt|reisig: Right - Roland :)|pg||
nt|baylind: .|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if one is enough dont need it|pg||
nt|jtr: But he might have cashed @cAk before a second trump maybe?|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||

nt|fabsayc: kibitzers, i see only the east hand|pg||
nt|stoffers: nice J@c|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Vugraphzfe: helness pushed @S7 toward Sadek and claimed down 1|pg||

mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|ady: unless finessing hearts|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|gambit: got to be tempted for a grand with the E hand after partner opens and fit is found, tough to stay out |pg||
mb|3S|nt|Vugraphzfd: lots of writin gby fredin|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can make 13 tricks also without finesse in @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: Bjorn sits up straight in chair|pg||
nt|gambit: can he trade the K@D for the Q@H?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ruffing 2@C and 1@d|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes 7@S looks makable|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but need to play seeing all cards :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 7@S in other room|pg||
nt|mrdct: i doubt this hand will be over before the top of the hour|pg||
nt|gambit: 7@s made there too wd |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 53 minutes on clock|pg||
nt|ady: I think 7 spades likely to go down   |pg||
nt|gambit: Tell that to Levin |pg||
mb|4C!|nt|ahollan1: i'm not positive if exact shape known or just 4@S & 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: on what line david?|pg||
nt|ady: what line do you make it?|pg||
nt|mrdct: dummy reversal|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|bridge_one: 7@S is very hard, but at the table can be made|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: with lead @s i think he will make|pg||
mb|7S|nt|mrdct: in the other room north bid 1@H which guided the play somewhat|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Peter now sits up|pg||
nt|gambit: No shyness here....|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Seriously, how do you guys play a double of 4@S in that auction?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The 4@S opening, I mean, not the overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: Will S lead a trump? I think so |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Pete says he has show 4 2 3 4 without Q of clubs|pg||
nt|mrdct: well there's no point leading a singleton to get a ruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Have i shown a maximum?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D lead looks most troublesome  but   is it a reasonable lead?  all depends upon what Fleisher knows about Fredin's shape|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: was told 4 2 3 4|pg||
nt|bridge_one: there are also the chance to play a double squeeze ruffing 2 @H in the dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: primarily penalty|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: thanks Debbie|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: I'm a takeout doubler myself, and it seems to me that Krekorian's hand was neither fish nor fowl|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: strul reaches for box but withdraws|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: helness said "I'm sorry" then continued in norwegian|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|nt|jtr: North overcalled 1@h|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: Walid asks: one suit?  and Helness says yes|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gambit: Passell knew what it was |pg||
nt|dinos1: 5@d or X?|pg||
nt|gambit: pass, dble, 4NT all options, I suspect double|pg||
nt|chick: a four-trump double|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4N - where's 10th trick?|pg||
nt|dinos1: rather 5@d if pd has @hKxx or any 4 @h's|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: Mike says luckier at the other table|pg||
nt|Walddk5: There is no double squeeze on a diamond lead. Helness got one in the other match. 7@S-1 was flat|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: good not to lead a heart|pg||

mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: oh -- De Knijff overcalled 1@H|pg||

nt|gambit: North bid hearts DavPro tells me - well, that changes things just a little, another lesson, sometimes, certainly that hand, silence is golden |pg||
nt|mrdct: on the face of it this looks like game in either major for NS - but both majors break 4-1 so it might be tricky|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|d|mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: I think 2@H just LR+|pg||

nt|gambit: N bid 1@H over 1@c with his x Q9xxx Q9xxx xx, (last hand) - giving a blueprint to the opps, serves them right |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Mike this game is too Hard|pg||
nt|mrdct: they seem very chatty at this table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fleisher @DJxx complicates the play|pg||
nt|gambit: Sometimes I think we fail to appreciate how well these players play, it is a treat to watch |pg||
nt|ady: also doubleton club|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bjacobs: So the idea behind Gazilli is that after 1major 1NT (and other auctions), 2@C is either clubs or a strong hand|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: 3@D was the bid|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's not real Gazzilli then|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Typically, the lowest unbid suit in response shows the top of the 1NT range, and commits to game if opener has the strong hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S would be the bid|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, no idea what 3@D means|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Less than 8, usually 2 spades|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: 14-16 1NT is ok with me|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: seven probably not with the odds - seems to need two 3-2 breaks|pg||
nt|sybarra: and if play 15-17?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gambit: N/S have not been swinging, perhaps last set will be more active|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: walid asks behind the screen.  helness: could be 5-5.  not 6-4, normally|pg||
nt|stoffers: lol, i got 12 specs answers in 3 seconds, 6 for @s, 6 for 1NT! People really judge differently :)|pg||

pc|c3|nt|dburn: but maybe some 4-1 diamond breaks can be handled|pg||
nt|dinos1: in 7 both mm's shd be 3-2 (or 3@d4@c in 1 hand)|pg||
nt|gambit: LOL, Stewy you make me laugh, and that (as Martha says - is a good thing), I think we forget that it is so easy seeing all hands, these players deserve our praise, they play at the ...|pg||
nt|gambit: top, and btw I did ask Eric Murray, Sami Kehela and Roy Hughes to Autorgraph Roy's book - for me dad. He was thrilled. |pg||
nt|dburn: but the break-even point for a grand slam is around the percentage chance of one 3-2 break (a little over 68%)|pg||
nt|stewball: thats what \i'm here for:)|pg||
nt|dinos1: Strul will continue with 4@c|pg||

nt|harmon: 4hts +3 was a push|pg||
nt|jtr: 3NT looks slightly better than 4@s|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lml: 6@S isnt terrible|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dburn: so, if you need a 3-2 break plus some handling, you should not be in seven|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: strul has been very composed throughout.  can't read what he's thinking, no indication he was about to take this leap|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dinos1: he has strong indication pd has stiff @h|pg||
nt|dburn: unless of course you are GIB, which would make seven without breaking sweat (not that software can sweat, but...)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|gambit: Presuambly 2C rebid adds some integrity to the @D suit |pg||

nt|ahollan1: interesting point is initial DBL -- is it Takeout [of @H] or @H??|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They did very well to penalise 2@C with just five between them, divided 3-2|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bjacobs: They must have ... East doubled the runout ... once again, takeout or penalties?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well at worst they would chalk up -180, so not that risky|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: primarily penalty, very old fashion of me|pg||
nt|bjacobs: dreadfully :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I guess you are 90% sure @CQ is a trick, so as you point out, it's going to be -180 at worst, and with your easy lead, you are quite likely to beat it|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: more writing|pg||

nt|gambit: given the state of the union too |pg||
nt|jtr: Didnt want to commit with 4|pg||

nt|jtr: Was the @dJ a strange card?|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 180 but not the way i predicted|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Still, Thomas is my favourite|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes for those that like fancy systems note that good old SEF does win a lot  sound bridge|pg||
nt|mikael_w: test|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: before we forget -- great job from our vugraph operator Debbie Hyatt !!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bjacobs: Final hand of the final set for the day.  A big well done to our fine operator John Schwartz.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: thx all|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And thanks to my fellow commentators, Martin, Roland and Henry, along with English language specialist David Burn|pg||
nt|mrdct: just need to drop the stiff @SK offside to make game here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|gambit: dble by E was silly, if undiscusssed as to length, as W 's bidding suggrdtd|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, this time e/w lost 2 IMP, next time they will push n/s to 3 @d and win 4 IMP|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bjacobs: Finally, our appreciation to the ACBL, in particular Jeff Johnston and Jan Martel for broadcasting this prestigious event. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: In just over 12 hours, the semi-finals commence|pg||
nt|hlortz: ah yes and the tireless Roland Wald who puts this show together|pg||
nt|bjacobs: tireless, and as far as I can tell, sleepless|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I may go for a kip now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need to find K sgl out |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 20 mins or so|pg||
nt|bjacobs: powernap|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So, Zimmermann vs Strul and de Knijff vs Fleisher in the semi-finals|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In exactly 12 hours from now|pg||
nt|ady: unless n/s can make 4@S  dropping sing King  looks like De Knijff will retain  a small lead|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: double here just keeps auction alive, i.e. takeout|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bjacobs: It's hard to commentate on this auction.  2@S ... was that a splinter?  Or some other form of raise?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: forcing raise i think|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: to game, with 2nt as the limit raise, but just a guess|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bjacobs: So, enough of science, wheel out Old Trusty|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mikael_w: I know 3 @d was home this time, But NEXT time its not that sure|pg||
nt|mrdct: if south was declarer and hadn't disclosed such @S length, you could work on the theory that if @SJ isn't covered the K is offside and then play for the drop - but with J109 in ...|pg||
nt|mrdct: dummy that theory wont work|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: best line on this lead, suggestions?|pg||
nt|po-s: finesse trumps...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart finesse, or heart ace and go for discards|pg||
nt|hlortz: on the bidding @D are 6-1 so no worries|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|bjacobs: Yes, and the @D3 confirms it|pg||
nt|hlortz: take the @H finesse|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So hook the heart without a care in the world|pg||
nt|po-s: still|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rabbi Rule rarely applied when appropriate|pg||
nt|gambit: TY to the players (fabulous bridge) the specs (wonderful silence), the VuG operator, (just plain great) and the commentators, hope you smiled, next session is (?) not ...|pg||
nt|gambit: sure....enjoyed, hope you all did too |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
mc|9|nt|Walddk2: Thanks to all spectators for watching. We hope you enjoyed the show and that you will be back in about 12 hours|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Cheers all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bye for now|pg||
nt|hlortz: and to all a good night|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i want a no blowout or refund clause :), good night all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: could have made it|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok, see you all when next set starts,|pg||
nt|ady: that the last  of the set?|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes - great work by debbie. particular relaying the comments being made by the players|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: yes|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great set -- Debbie please thank the players for us|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: okay|pg||
nt|gambit: thx Al H, super job |pg||
nt|mrdct: the next set is fairly soon i believe - with the meal break between the 2nd and 3rd segments|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I have found out that next set prob will start in about 15 min|pg||
nt|gambit: not much of a break....|pg||
nt|gambit: cheers to all |pg||
nt|ahollan1: next set scheduled to begin in 20 minutes -- but teams can restart whenever they want|pg||
nt|bridge_one: THX ALL for Wothching|pg||
nt|mrdct: if these guys played anywhere remotely close to 7.5 minutes per board they would get ample time for breaks and get to bed before midnight|pg||
