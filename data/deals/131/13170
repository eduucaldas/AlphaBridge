nt|jbgood: 12 of the 14 imps difference was the starting point - as a carry over from a previous encounter|pg||
nt|xenya: well done by NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: ready for actionboard :)|pg||
nt|othered1: This may be fun, depending upon who gets hung first by the misfit|pg||
mb|1C!|an|2+|nt|ahollan1: both of these pairs use multi-purpose opening 2-bids -- most everything else is natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lilley-Nagy strong NT  Delivera-Robinson ACOL with Weak NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|peacokk: EW better stay low on this one|pg||
nt|jbgood: the Blakset lead is a carry over from previous encounter|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: NS playing 5card major and 15-17nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: EW plays 5-card major and 14+-17 nt|pg||
nt|jbgood: if N can get to know that Auken has a 5 card @d suit - difficult if Fredin jumps in|pg||
nt|xenya: we are in for a bit of fun here i think |pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzey: 3@h = 10-12 and 3@s|pg||
nt|jallerton: EW play strong NT, NS play weak NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d = 5+@c and eighter invitational to game or invitational to slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2nt = minors|pg||
nt|othered1: may turn out to be a test of NS's countermethods to unusual NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I guess NS plays 3@c from North = I have my own suit and I want to bid at least game|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@s = I have my @s-suit|pg||
nt|othered1: Most pairs play something along the lines of "unusual/unusual" where minor suit bids distinguish hands with major suit lengths.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: indeed -- what should N do now -- would 3@H be forcing -- or should he double or cuebid first|pg||
nt|xenya: so cuebid it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@h directly after 2nt is not forcing -- but 3@c is forcing with own suit - 3@d would have been forcing with @s support|pg||
mb|d|nt|jallerton: maybe 2@h shows a weak NT type hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: sr I cant explain 2@h and 2@s ... South has not asked W yet :(|pg||
nt|jallerton: http://www2.bridge.dk/Systemkort.aspx?ID=375 for convention cards|pg||
nt|xenya: that didn't get them too far, did it|pg||
nt|othered1: if that's a cue-bid, not simply showing @H with game values (my method)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = FG, 25+BAL or weak 2@H/@S|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jbgood: the double by N paid off|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hmmm in that context, seems 2@S should be weak 2@S opening|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzey: 4nt = 1430 |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 5@c = one ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@h shows only 3-card @c ... and a weak nt-hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: I was close!|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: yes ... you are good :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, makes sense -- 3@C shows @Hs, 3@D would show a spade fit|pg||
nt|othered1: On the auction, 4@H is high enough.  With quiet EW's might get quite a bit higher|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: yes and 3@h natural nonforcing and 3@s natural support nonforcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not easy to see how many tricks declarer can take|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: looks like Nagy is using the same Convention Card that I am :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: NS leads 1.3.5.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: was 4@c just a game force?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 4@c is explained as 2-suiter and GF |pg||
pc|h4|nt|jbgood: a likely 2 down..|pg||
nt|jbgood: the double by N was really a tough bid|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jallerton: maybe direct 3@c over 2@h would have been stronger and he has to go via 2@s to sign off|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|santyclz: Alerted so might be more.|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s6|nt|santyclz: Thanks Jan.|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||

pc|h9|pc|c5|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|jallerton: it looks as though declarer will have to fall back on the @d finesse.  |pg||
pc|cK|nt|jallerton: He might be able to make it double dummy with a red suit squeeze against South, but that must be worse odds|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|peacokk: I think it's too hard|pg||

pc|hA|pc|d4|nt|jbgood: i do too|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|h8|pc|cT|nt|jbgood: and the final double may have warned about the bad trump split so much that declarer actually may bet out cheaper than with no opposition bidding|pg||

mb|1N|an|11 - 14|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|othered1: Steve Robinson -- "always open a 5-card major" -- wouuld approve of south's action.   But most players would open this hand 1@H, if they open at all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S normally 5+ --- but this is great lead director in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzey: 2@h= 12-15hcp and natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: if they open with a natural 1-bid, that is.|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|jallerton: trump lead should be on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I guess @c K|pg||
nt|ahollan1: CC doesn't describe the passed hand 2N -- but sure looks like they are NOT playing Drury|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: I got it|pg||
nt|jallerton: did you have inside information, Jan?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphzey: me ... nooo|pg||
nt|othered1: can I assume double was penalty-oriented?|pg||
mb|d|nt|santyclz: The controversial 3-card raise.  I like it.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jbgood: the low club lead may induce N to continue the suit.. |pg||
nt|peacokk: Will Konow be able to read @C3?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: W said: "Make some room for these" when he put down the @ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: dbl = penalty|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: but South is a chicken and pull to 3@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW standard signals|pg||
nt|ahollan1: concensus is 2N=max with 3@S    that's the bid that Drury handles with 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Trump split doesn't help this, but favorable @H position may be useful.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: some like it, I prefer 4 card raise unless no other bid..|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, all|pg||
nt|xenya: hello again|pg||
nt|othered1: @S position isn't necessarily clear to east.  Couldn't south be 2=5=1=5?|pg||
nt|othered1: Of coiurse, east is thinking about lots more than the play to this trick.|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I have been told that the open room "crashed" -- but now we are back - but this board has been played - and South won 8 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: many lead the second best from a bad suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: NS leads are 2.4.|pg||
nt|jbgood: second from top i mean|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: but later in the "game" they play 2.4. with attitude -- so then they play 2. from 4 bad ones|pg||
nt|othered1: Certainly a possible result|pg||
pc|d3|nt|santyclz: Although this may not be the poster-child hand for it.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|jbgood: he may just make it|pg||

nt|jbgood: but difficult for N to see?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Everybody agree with 4@h?|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: Richman 'sounds like u have a good hand partner good luck'|pg||
pc|h3|nt|peacokk: Yes, it was|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: imo -- the auction screamed for a trump lead|pg||

pc|d2|nt|xenya: E's rather|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|vugraphzey: speed up time @cJ :)|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: unlike the previous 2 boards -- this hand is just a matter of overtricks|pg||

nt|fabsayc: they used to select american teams that way, which sometimes lead to teams where the members where antagonistic to each other|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: I don't play hands well enough to be able to afford that|pg||

pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: so -- we only know what ONE of the other pairs has done    there are actually 8 tables in play|pg||

nt|djneill: playing against this kind of multi, you don't worry about the 25+ GF bal variety, what is it like 30-1 odds against?|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|keylime:  Here's a bid that depending where one is in the world, it is either very common, or like here in North America, very tightly regulated with prepared defenses required by the pair using it|pg||

nt|ahollan1: probably better chance at overtrick by playing 3 rounds of diamonds ending in DUMMY  then declarer knows if @D is good or not and might have distribution info to decide about @s ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: none of the players will be caught and fined for violating the speedlimit|pg||
nt|dburn: particularly if 1@c does not show clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I think EW plays 1@c as at least a 3-card @c :)|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@c, however, does show clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|jallerton: 2@d Multi includes 3-7HCP weak 2s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 2nt as S|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Robinson didn't have a Weak 2@D mechanism|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: that @dA cash seems a little dangerous - what if East has the @dJ and @c are 4-4 then 2NT makes while cashing the clubs then a @h through always sets it|pg||

nt|fabsayc: and from the sensible side also|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dburn: 12 IMPs to Blakset on 7, where North chose to lead a club against 3NT - conveniently in dummy at trick one, declarer played a spade towards the queen at trick 2 and never knew he ...|pg||

nt|othered1: It looks like you could do business with north, but entries aren't right.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can't interpret this auction; hopefully the players can|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after seeing bad @D split -- you would need to play @S to dummy then have courage to cash 3 rounds of @H AND @C|pg||
mb|5C|an|A or KQ|nt|othered1: I think I would make 6N with @S lead.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i think both players a bit pushy looking for that non-vul game   but that may be resulting|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: likely push here, unlucky slams|pg||
mb|1S|nt|santyclz: In the open room they got to 5@ds on the hand played so nicely here in 3nt.  It wasn't a success.|pg||
nt|othered1: @C lead would have been OK if north had selected the K|pg||
nt|frankaus: the top 3 pairs form the opem team to play at PABF (NZ) and Commonwealth Games (India) |pg||
nt|keylime:  I like six diamonds here but the split in diamonds sinks this without an enlightened guess.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|djneill: 6N appears to be correct since if @d don't break, might get 3@h, 3@d, 3@c and 3@s, while 6@d is very often just down on a bad break, right?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yikes, south giving hints|pg||
nt|djneill: I would not have suspected this Michaels, but N-S play limited openings, where North would open many 9's|pg||
nt|djneill: South is rather sure E-W have slam|pg||
nt|keylime:  That is waving a red flag to a bull I suspect|pg||
mb|3D|nt|frankaus: may be just the imfo to bring home 12|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: still much to do in this match|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jbgood: Blakset bid 5@d on   6 in OR - and gave away a tenner|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i bet some ACOLites would open West hand 1@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: test spades first in 6NT|pg||
nt|frankaus: NS open most 8 counts|pg||
mb|6N|nt|othered1: This can be beaten off the top, of course|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then  1@C-1@H:2@S allows Robinson to describe his hand really well|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ah, so south already knew opponents likely to have slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|peacokk: Interesting choice of bidding by Blakset|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Why not leave a decision to partner what to do after RD?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Gosney didn't have that problem  Tony Nunn opened SOUTH hand 3rd seat 1@D|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jbgood: looks as if all roads lead to Home|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@c said "I have opened light"|pg||
nt|jallerton: with an extra ace, South would pass|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes, but there can still be a penalty|pg||
nt|othered1: But game on 26 HCP is very normal and none seem to have a play.|pg||
nt|dburn: may be harder to beat off the bottom, as it were|pg||
nt|othered1: Hard to come up with a position (@HKQJxx, prehaps) where north must fly with the ace|pg||
nt|othered1: KQ9xx, rather|pg||
nt|djneill: so how would East count out this hand to guess the @d, frank?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jallerton: at the 1-level when partner can't open the bidding?  Unlikely!|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jbgood: 4@h on for EW - not easy to bid.. and S makes 3 @s|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|s5|nt|santyclz: A play on "all Rhodes lead to Rome."|pg||
nt|jbgood: rare that you can play ANY of dummy's 12 cards and win|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If there isn´t - let him still have a choise|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: @s3 said .. I dont like @c ... do you have somethink else|pg||
nt|othered1: Andnow they have to get the @d position right|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it was pointed out to me that Robinson could NOT bid 1@C-1@H:2@S  -- that would be a splinter in support of @H|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@S shows 5/5 but peake may do it 4/5|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: 5@D looks like Exclusion Key Card   with 5@S showing 1 Key card, not counting @DA|pg||

nt|frankaus: nagy one of the best declarers in the country|pg||

nt|keylime:  I think once North follows to the second heart here, it is an near open book in diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually can squeeze north now|pg||
nt|djneill: even a 5-0 break can make 4@d, 3@c, 3@h, 2@s|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|jbgood: now the defense gets a di trick - if he had played on clubs W would have to cash his @d ace to get it|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: Nagy duck of @CA has givein Delivera some timing problems|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think Ian can make now|pg||

pc|h2|nt|mrnye: oops|pg||
pc|c6|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cK|nt|djneill: even if South has the stiff @dJ, South will have no @s to return, so will win anyways|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: sorry misclick|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: what??|pg||
nt|mrnye: oh actually he can still make - north is getting strip squeezed if he cashed the king of clubs there then the QD then exited a spade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: surely club first|pg||
nt|mrnye: no good now|pg||
nt|frankaus: somewhere lost the @S pips|pg||

nt|keylime:  one more big score and I'd ask for a declaration....|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jallerton: even a club lead does not beat slam, as the hand with @sA does not have another club|pg||

mb|p|nt|jbgood: but this time the brakes were too good:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 1@s is Walsh ... might have longer @d suit|pg||
nt|jbgood: easy to remember to alert when you actually have a longer @d suit - easy to forget if not:)|pg||
nt|othered1: Right, a lucky grand can generate action|pg||
nt|dburn: but this Danish version of the dealing program may be worth exporting - just been watching a bunch of part scores in the Camrose, so this is a change for the better|pg||
nt|mrnye: the richman-peake system certainly creates swings but they are often on the right side of the swing.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|vugraphzey: Now W alerted 4@d --- South hasnt asked --- but at first W didnt alert now he has|pg||
nt|mrnye: it's just something you have to live with when you play these sort of methods - you WILL get some bad results from the system|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jbgood: 3 @d looks like a minisplinter - and now Søren has some extras for his bid..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I use 2nt different. 2nt is not only inviting , contains also some defensive values|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 @s is what makes|pg||
nt|jbgood: Fredin keeps underleading red aces|pg||
nt|jallerton: South knows that someone is probably void in hearts, so sensibly tries the unbid suit|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure whether 4@h is "last train" or a psychic cue bid, but still all outcomes possible|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|frankaus: plase remember the scoring is V a mean datum of the middle 3 scores from 5 tables  - the score we see is not what the players will end with|pg||

nt|ralfwil: What´s your opinion Jeffrey, about 2nt inviting? like here or as I play with defensive values (top honours)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure how they choose the 3rd pair for the upcoming NZ hosted PABF|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dburn: probably, though, East will just try for a grand slam and then not bid one|pg||

pc|s9|nt|othered1: How many years does it take till they learn?|pg||

nt|vugraphzey: 1-2 minutes |pg||
nt|jallerton: I think there are plenty of ways to raise partner through cue bids, so 2NT is better used as natural|pg||

nt|vugraphzey: 2@h = 3card support and to good for just 2@s |pg||

nt|jallerton: I'm a little surprised North didn't open|pg||
nt|jallerton: he can double now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ACOL 2@D before 1@S  ----   there is a large number of 2/1 players who would bid 1@S  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: some will only bypass 4-card @S with 2 more in minor, others NEVER bypass @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I think it is easier to understand 1@S if playing relays, otherwise i'm not convinced [yet]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D    probably not good enough for splinter|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Agree jeffrey1 For me a clear opening on N! but if Ps bid is 3@d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d = 14-16 med 5+@h og 4+@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2nt = at least values to game|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrnye: gill-gosney play a system that you are probably more familiar with in the USA - the Sydney players tend to play more modern methods than the rest of the country|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: 2@d not transfer |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d is "stayman-like" according to conventioncard|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@s = single @s and maximum|pg||
nt|xenya: well. this may be another chance for Konow -- the dealer is really generous|pg||
nt|djneill: ok nick fahrer, owner of the Bridge Shop, says they play transfer responses to standard @c more often now than before, which is starting to take hold among the top standard players ...|pg||
nt|djneill: everywhere|pg||
nt|keylime:  2@s goes down on a spade lead and continuation comfortably|pg||
nt|fabsayc: down 3 maybe four|pg||
nt|frankaus: i predict - Little Old Ladies will be playing transfer responses in 10 years |pg||

nt|fabsayc: they already do Dwayne|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jallerton: You have to pass.  Opposite a passed hand double 2NT should be scramble|pg||

nt|dburn: you might as well play it as opposed to the six - who knows what might happen?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if there is a @D lead that could stop West from cashing @DA before playing the 1st @C|pg||
mb|1S|nt|peacokk: Nice sacrifice in OR|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H!|an|3Spades 11-12|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|vugraphzey: 2@h is weak @h support from South .... 2@d would have been a good @h support|pg||
nt|jallerton: East has a decision to make now.  3@C?  3@S?  Force to game with 3@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  now 3@d as a game try by N?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d is a kind of "reversed Drury" ... 2@d shows that W has an opening hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: N awaits a high ! contract ..|pg||
nt|jbgood: @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@c is a kind of "reversed Drury" ... 2@d shows that W has an opening hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Robinson 1@C=4+|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: is this the final countdown|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: lead is @c J|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: another chance lost -- 3N by W would have probably made|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jbgood: 3 @h is by most players just a fight - strange action by N|pg||
nt|jallerton: With West haveing a light opening bid (Fredin passed in the other room) the low road works well|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|othered1: Wrong-sided as the cards lie.  But somehow 2N with that @H holding deserves some punishment, if not the obvious one.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: their 2N opener is @C & @D -- i wonder how they handle the various 20+ balanced hands|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzey: seems like we have to congratulate Lars Blakset - Jakob Røn, Håkan Nilsson - Peter Fredin and Mathias Bruun - Knut Blakset with a place in the final|pg||
nt|xenya: however a few spectators point out it can still be made on a squeeze|pg||

pc|s2|nt|peacokk: 4 IMPs to Blakset|pg||

nt|jallerton: This is the last board of the set. Thank-you to Jan Nielsen, our excellent vu-graph operator.|pg||
nt|jallerton: Thanks also to my co-commentator, Ralf Willquist|pg||
nt|jallerton: Thanks also to the DBF (Jacob Duschek and Matias Rohrberg) for arranging the broadcast, |pg||
nt|jallerton: ..finally thanks to BBO and Roland Wald for making this broadcast possible.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Thank Jan for your nice work and Jeffrey for nice cooperation:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: We are a little behind schedule --- we are ready to start the last segment in about one hour and 5 minutes.|pg||
nt|jallerton: 6@s has a lot of work to do on this deal - went off in the other room even with @sQx onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: last board of the match .. The Fat Lady is on stage .. ready to sing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fortuitous @S layout considering the bad @C break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and now the last -- if we can just avoid another crash ....|pg||
nt|mrnye: at the other table south doubled 3H for the lead which leads to 9 tricks only because the heart can't get discarded in time on the clubs|pg||
nt|djneill: doubling an artificial bid for the lead when partner is going to be on lead is a great idea I think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: over the double should bid only 3, on this auction i think 4|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|vugraphzey: 3nt = good 4major opening ... suit is unknown|pg||
nt|Walddk11: Many thanks to Jan Nielsen, great operating all day!|pg||
nt|Walddk11: and to Vladimir, Ed and David for commentary|pg||
nt|othered1: And thank you, Roland, for keeping so many balls in the air this weekend.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk11: Draining but it's fun|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 4@h = pass if @h is your suit or correct to 4@s if thats your suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I think it is better to use the intermediate step as the (artificial) game try, and double as a suggestion of penalty|pg||
nt|peacokk: Isn't it as playing with a junior - every game-try is a way to game|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|jallerton: Do you have time for dinner, Jan?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2NT relay|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: If you know my weight you wouldnt be asking ... I look like one who ALWAYS have time for dinner :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: and today is no exception .... I promise :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: 3@h is transfer|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@s shows 3-card @s .. with only two North would bid 3nt|pg||
pc|hK|nt|henryb:  that is a brave balance|pg||
nt|jbgood: Difficult for Konow to win this board - but may get a push|pg||
nt|mrnye: I dont like the 1nt bid by andrew here|pg||
nt|mrnye: opposite a favourable 1S overcall you are just asking for trouble|pg||
nt|mrnye: richman could be overcalling many 6-7 counts here|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|jallerton: Well you have worked hard for it today.  Enjoy!|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 5@h = 2 aces an no @sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk11: Pharmaservice by 4 IMPs with 4 comparisons to come in the other semi-final|pg||
nt|Walddk11: Two very tight semi-finals|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Tomorrow we start at 9am -- looking forward to seeing you all then :) |pg||
nt|Walddk11: And the bridge has been very good most of the time|pg||
nt|othered1: With lots of exciting hands and, accordingly, chances to misjudge things.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|mrnye: 1nt should show 11-13 or so in this sort of auction|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jallerton: a play problem to end with then|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jallerton: still.  South has to lead something|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: if this wins the match is all square|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|jbgood: the step - balance sure is breave:) |pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
nt|jallerton: that lead helps declarer more than the @h selected in the other room|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: nice defense!|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|jallerton: he can now count 12 tricks if @s are 2-2, but can he make it on 3-1 spades?|pg||
nt|Walddk11: Thanks all, see you tomorrow|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk11: Bye for now|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: bye|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: and sleep welle|pg||
nt|othered1: Thaks all and bye!|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jbgood: and the balance was not found at the other table|pg||
nt|djneill: the @h situation is probably marked here - East showed 4, and West let the @hK, unlikely West would lead from a doubleton King knowing the opponents had 7 of them, unless it was KQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not that clear from lead, but is strange defense if nagy has the queen|pg||
nt|keylime:  I duck because I really have no compelling reason to cover here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jbgood: bye all - see you in an hour or so for the next 16|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: if the match ends "all square" after the last 16 boards tonight, then Konow will earn a place in tomorrows final |pg||
nt|jallerton: might try @c finesse now|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jbgood: 9 imps with 2 sessions to go|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: still need to play 32 boards in this semifinal ... see you all later|pg||
nt|jbgood: bye all|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|mrnye: east may find the play with QTxx though since he knows south has two good diamonds and that the heart is his only possible entry|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|peacokk: Not the best line |pg||
nt|jallerton: now needs @s 2-2 or possibly @SQ singleton|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzey: see you all in one hour|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|mrnye: would be a great defence from nagy - i wouldn't put it passed him|pg||
