nt|Walddk4: You have created a broadcast of your own|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ritong: two vulnerable game swings is an important gap|pg||
nt|hlortz: NS play sort of Kaplan-Sheinwold weak NT non vul 5cd majors and EW are a pretty tradional French pair father-son M Bessis being the father|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hlortz: hello all. we are back i see|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome to finals of this long event (barring overtime)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|daman: and away we go|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ritong: hi there|pg||
nt|hlortz: note Martel opens 1@C not 1N playing weak NT|pg||
mb|4S|nt|othered1: somehow, Levin avoided the 1@H overcall and chose stay out.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: Mutton|pg||
mb|d|nt|ritong: operator, who is the bessis with spectacles?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but doing this allowed opponents to compete more easily, which often happens|pg||
nt|ritong: well, the opening bid was 1 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: father michel|pg||
nt|hlortz: 1@H lead director :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: yes, but east or west:)|pg||
nt|ritong: thanks|pg||
pc|hK|nt|daman: lucky to find pd with xx in @S    but he had few options|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w appear to have a lucky 3N with spades breaking 3-3|pg||
nt|chick: lucky also to get a 3-3 split|pg||
nt|ritong: an overcall remains possible, of course|pg||
nt|othered1: true|pg||
nt|ritong: but sporty|pg||
nt|fabsayc: nothing wrong with heart lead :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes and Martel trapped into the 4@S overbid.... |pg||
nt|othered1: Strong NT can be preemptive, too.|pg||
nt|ritong: certainly so  4@h looks cold, at first sight|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes need the @D ruff to hold it to 4@H so the preemptive strong NT strikes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: as they said when Versace did it, it was the heart seven that made suit good enough|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra2: hello all and welcome back to Reno |pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|daman: EW played in 2@D on the 4-2 in the OR|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3-3 or Ax under|pg||
nt|daman: the pass of 2@D seems flawed|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ritong: so, a no swing board|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|hlortz: westart with a routine 3N - just a matter of overtricks|pg||

pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||

nt|ritong: now we have two thomas  so the one with spectacles is?|pg||
nt|ritong: only one ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no heart underlead|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dinos1: y, better play 2@s on 5-1 fit than 2@d on 4-2|pg||

nt|warrens:  if N reads it as a doubleton|pg||
nt|warrens:  a spade would also work|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@SX down 2 on last board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|barnets: 15 imps only now margin|pg||
nt|pef: either a spade shift or a club shift by south ensures himself a ruff as long as helness returned the suit led|pg||
nt|barnets: hi|pg||
nt|pef: so the match now down to 15 imp lead for fleisher|pg||
nt|dburn: odd, that - would have overcalled 2NT over 2@d myself, and would not have doubled 3@d|pg||

nt|warrens:  Helness was more certain that W had 3 spades than 3 clubs|pg||

nt|hlortz: 9 IMPs to Zimmermann tightens up the match|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i might try to guess with their bidding style, but this is dangerous:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|merijng: slam on finesse|pg||
mb|1N|nt|othered1: A solid start, taking advantage of the opponents' methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: wrong red K|pg||
nt|ritong: thank you  you have two thomas on screen, actually|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: south pased in both rooms wisely|pg||
nt|barnets: and in open ew are trying for slam|pg||
nt|ritong: odds are thay will pay it back, with 15 boards left|pg||
mb|d!|nt|barnets: in open south after passing came in with a 2@H bid |pg||
nt|ritong: but unsure:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: writing I think it says single suit but I can't really see that far|pg||
nt|fabsayc: passed hand balance seat double can be minor one suiter, even if that is not normal meaning|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: ouch|pg||
nt|othered1: west may feel obligated to get his @H into the auction.  But it's not without risk.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: martel may pass|pg||
nt|hlortz: martel tempted to pass?|pg||
nt|ritong: certainly so|pg||
nt|othered1: and lead @D?|pg||
mb|2C!|an|pass or correct|mb|p|nt|janm: Double is normally a 4 card Major and a longer minor, but I think that the balancing double can also be a diamond 1-suiter|pg||
mb|2D|nt|barnets: e/w did very well to stop in 5@S in open|pg||
nt|merijng: stopped in 5 in the other room|pg||
nt|ritong: do they play weak 2 in @ds, jan?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ritong: opening, that is|pg||
nt|ritong: probably not, since lew has a pure hand for it|pg||
nt|janm: No, 2@d is Flannery|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: west keycarded found partner with 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: should be fine now|pg||
nt|ritong: ahum|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: maybe the play with go faster than this afternoon|pg||
nt|ritong: okay, we have an other possible tip  the one who looks older?|pg||
nt|chick: another routine 4@H, probably flat|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: michel|pg||
nt|hlortz: another flat game... at least no room for commentators to make errors - yet :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: they might have too much momentum in this room|pg||
nt|ritong: lol  ok, forget it:)|pg||
nt|ritong: ok  thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: @c cue - @h cue - 4N  -5@s|pg||
nt|barnets: and decided not to bank on the @D finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch the play in both rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: writing at both side of the table|pg||
nt|daman: do we all agree with the 4@H bid by East?|pg||
nt|janm: And although they might sometimes open 3@d with a hand like Lew's, not in second seat vul :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ritong: i understand:)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|barnets: no|pg||
nt|daman: same here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: so if tom brings this home, the gap will be divided by two  an affair|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hlortz: surely henri you know their styles well enough soon u will tell us who is pere et fils|pg||
nt|ritong: yers, but if i err, i will be in trouble:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: thats the idea!|pg||
nt|ritong: eheheh|pg||
nt|ritong: til now, the two auctions were automatic|pg||
nt|chick: I have it on good authority that Michel is the father and he is sitting east|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, michel is the father, no doubt about it|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ritong: all right now  thank you operator|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: fingers can only type so fast and follow the play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: :)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|chick: depends on what 4@C was|pg||
nt|barnets: but slam is 50 percent|pg||
nt|chick: alerted, it could have been an asking bid|pg||
nt|barnets: which is ok|pg||
nt|dinos1: what's wrong with 4@h?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cards really favorable for declaer, can make 3|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like another methods swing.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ralfwil: Good Morning everyone|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dinos1: exchange @d-@h in W's hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ritong: hi|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|daman: 11 to Fleisher now     a new leader|pg||
nt|merijng: Was 4H cuebid?|pg||
nt|daman: I think you need to be able to see a source of tricks     and East cannot see that really|pg||
nt|barnets: 22 imps on the position of the @DK|pg||
nt|dinos1: cue-bidding doesnt show extras. it shows location of controls|pg||
nt|daman: he is fortunate West had such a great hand|pg||
nt|barnets: the other room|pg||
nt|dinos1: E hand is limited but not W who sees source of tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: weinstein must have been dissuded from bidding slam by helgemos overcall|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|merijng: maybe zimmerman hoped for ace of club instead of king of spade in which case he need 1 out of 2 finesses|pg||

pc|d2|nt|barnets: not as bad as it seems|pg||
nt|athene: The idea being, if you don't bid 1NT right away, you aren't going to be able to get your hand across at all.|pg||

pc|d9|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s3|pc|c6|nt|athene: yes, declarer can plod away stolidly with the clubs|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|barnets: can e/w make 3n ?|pg||
nt|athene: and come to one club, @HAK, @DAQ|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, but this may swing some imps back to Fleisher|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|athene: Even if EW can make 3NT, they surely won't be bidding it.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|barnets: they have 3@D 2@H 2@C and 2@S if they can get at them|pg||
nt|dburn: they might|pg||
nt|barnets: I have seen a lot worse 3ns make|pg||
nt|barnets: on the last board e/w in 2@H when we saw 3 go down 1|pg||
nt|dburn: after all, how would you proceed with the East hand if partner opened (in effect) a weak no trump?|pg||
nt|barnets: well 2@C seems normal|pg||
nt|barnets: and game try of a kind|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
nt|dburn: sure, and over 2@d you might pass, but you'd probably bite the bullet and bid 2NT|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pef: now down to 11 imps.  unlike the 3rd quarter which started out with a lot of no-swing boards, we've seen three likely swings already here|pg||

mb|1C|nt|daman: y'all|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|daman: a strong NT auction on the horizon|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hlortz: we are treated to a modern non vul preempt|pg||
nt|ritong: the aggressive preempt will not produce a clash|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: chip martel avoided the debatable 1 NT overcall|pg||
nt|othered1: The Frenchy always have 4 trumps to raise at once|pg||

nt|ritong: :)|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|daman: will South invite with a square 8 points?   yep|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: Hi Warren|pg||
nt|dinos1: I wdnt|pg||
nt|hlortz: yet another routine game.|pg||
nt|ritong: michel will start with the @s J|pg||
nt|ritong: just in case, sometimes north holds K10x|pg||
nt|hlortz: in order to pick up K10x onside |pg||
nt|hlortz: u type faster|pg||
nt|ritong: and i am not that used to comprehensive colleagues who rebound, i ll take it into account:)|pg||
nt|chick: N is trying to decide which of him many suits to signal for |pg||
nt|ritong: probably a puppet to 2@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: i think he also tries to sdend a message  "please do not play from dummy that fast on first trick"|pg||
nt|ritong: tor helness got a bit more enterprising and paid 300|pg||
nt|hlortz: so probably 5 IMPs will go back on this hand... |pg||
nt|ritong: 150 is 4:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: u think they will make FIVE @D ??|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dinos1: 4333 and lone @hJ|pg||
nt|ritong: but it will be at least 170|pg||
nt|ritong: no.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a nt-contract is rather easy with almost every card on side|pg||

nt|ritong: oh, no problem|pg||
pc|sA|nt|barnets: well helgemo did|pg||
nt|warrens:  I wouldn't either, but both tables did and they're in the Vandy final:)|pg||
nt|barnets: in the other room playing 15-17|pg||
nt|daman: I have too many scars to invite with hands like that    |pg||
nt|dinos1: @c lead - down from the start|pg||
nt|daman: they will prevail   I would have lost IMPs|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe thats why these guys are in the final|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ritong: trying to sneak an entry  not today|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
nt|hlortz: think he will cash A@S going to dummy w A@D and finessing risks K10 of @S and dbltn @D in south|pg||

nt|hlortz: tho since he ruffed Q@S that loses to K10x onside hmm|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|pef: 6c certainly a reasonable contract here|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@C is very decent here|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|warrens:  this might be flat.  I don't expect 6@C at either table|pg||
nt|pef: although a bit tricky to reach|pg||
nt|athene: North can try a gentle 4NT now, which will get them to 4NT perhaps...|pg||
nt|pef: helness might try 4n and then 6c by south not so unlikely|pg||
nt|barnets: north has extras|pg||
nt|barnets: if he just had the @CJ|pg||
nt|barnets: that would certainly get him to bid again|pg||
nt|pef: I think 4nt by north is reasonable here, what do the rest of you think?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: The @C109 might be enough but he doesn't expect his partner to have much of a club fit.|pg||
nt|dburn: awkward - if he were to bid, I think he should bid spades|pg||
nt|barnets: you need to play clubs and not no trump |pg||
nt|pef: maybe south should have bid 3c instead of that heart suit?|pg||
nt|barnets: of course east may not lead a heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: from the Kj|pg||
nt|barnets: and then 6N is fine|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:  4@S is an interesting bid.  since N didn't bid 2@S over 2@H, this should be a slam try|pg||
nt|dburn: South could not, as far as I know, bid a forcing 3@c, so he had to bid that heart suit|pg||
nt|barnets: south thinks his part could have the @HK|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: if he knew what he had would bid 6@C|pg||
nt|pef: yes, although I think I like 4c better.  I think it very likely levin will lead a heart and this will go down a bunch|pg||
nt|barnets: so a huge lead problem here|pg||
nt|athene: South could have offered 6@C, or at the very least 5NT (if it's pick-a-slam)|pg||
nt|athene: But it's rare that pick-a-slam is used to say "bid 6NT if you have a king which needs protecting on the lead"|pg||
nt|pef: I agree, 5n pick a slam seems better than just leaping to 6n.  helness would have an easy 6c call then|pg||
nt|barnets: north is not going to pick clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: sure he is|pg||
nt|barnets: with 87 when partner has bid them once|pg||
nt|athene: north can hardly have better than small doubleton club can he, by this point?|pg||
nt|pef: but can he have much better than a doubleton on his auction?|pg||
nt|barnets: he can have HX|pg||
nt|athene: South could have bid 3@C over 2NT of course|pg||
nt|barnets: KX Qx JX|pg||
nt|pef: bobby levin thinking this lead could easily decide who wins the vanderbilt|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all.|pg||
nt|pef: and he might just be right|pg||
nt|barnets: he has no safe lead either|pg||
nt|barnets: so might just pull out the @H|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pef: meanwhile, fleisher did gain 5 imps on the previous board|pg||
nt|barnets: theopps have bid the other 3 suits|pg||
nt|pef: wow!|pg||
pc|cQ|mc|12|nt|pef: well about 100 specs made rude comments about the lead, another 100 told me that expected it|pg||
nt|athene: Traditionally you lead safely against 6NT - but that's when there are two balanced hands.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Levin slammed his cards on the table, mad at himself/his lead.|pg||
nt|poohbear: entries permitting the correct way to play the @c suit for 5 tricks ( non heart lead) is low to the Q and if that holds cross back and low toward the 109|pg||
nt|pef: I always thought you led aggressively against small slams|pg||
nt|athene: When the contract is based on long suit(s), I don't see why the normal rule of leading aggressively shouldn't apply.|pg||

nt|othered1: Why 2@S?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|barnets: and a spec with a sense of humour wants to know if it costs 10$|pg||
nt|dinos1: I knew pair who used 5-4-3-2-1 honor count|pg||
nt|merijng: boring boards until now, except the slam on finesse but thats just 50/50 so oke to bid or stay out|pg||
nt|ritong: south might cue twice|pg||

nt|othered1: ty|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D seems obvious now to me|pg||
mb|4C|nt|barnets: not really |pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: does S raise 2@s to 3? I think so |pg||
nt|hlortz: yes that 9@S in west is a big card |pg||
nt|ritong: and with a six bagger, north should cooperate|pg||
nt|ritong: til now, he has promised three @ss, and he has six|pg||
nt|gambit: and a dearth of values beyond spade 5/6 |pg||
nt|ritong: superb decision by martel|pg||
nt|othered1: buit there's still that misfit |pg||
nt|hlortz: well the @C raise may salvage a near push  great bid at least on this hand :)|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|barnets: both sides could have made 3N|pg||
nt|warrens:  is 4@D now kickback?|pg||
nt|ritong: they probably will lose 2 imps, but have avoided the worst so far|pg||
nt|othered1: so 4N is?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond cue presumably|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: wow super well done|pg||
nt|ritong: extreme faith|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Marty sorry if I did wrong pd?|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, if 4@D is kickback, then 4N should be a @d cue bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: undo|pg||
mb|5H|nt|barnets: but played in partials going down at the 2 level|pg||
nt|dinos1: ... and were down in suit p/score)|pg||
nt|hlortz: south quite the pessimist|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: oth souths pushed to game on the last board|pg||
nt|merijng: true :), tough to bid 3nt with misfit like that and 24 hcp though|pg||
nt|othered1: now they have to put on the brakes|pg||
mb|6C|nt|barnets: beating some of the commentators out of 6 imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|merijng: true but i mean not so exciting for the audience , waiting for more exciting hands|pg||

nt|ralfwil: I don´t like 4nt with a void in partners suit, but perhaps another meaning than asking for aces?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|barnets: it is one of te biggest tournaments around and we have a 3 imps margin|pg||
nt|barnets: I think thats pretty exciting|pg||
nt|barnets: also there has never been a french team in he final|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Please understand that the commentators may not have time to respond to private chat messages. No offence intended. Useful info much appreciated though|pg||
nt|barnets: that exciting for the french|pg||
nt|ralfwil: thx all for information about 4nt|pg||
nt|bucheister: 4C could be RCK for clubs and 4NT showed 2 and the Q|pg||
nt|ritong: so stansby will consider his possibilities against @c KJxx on|pg||
nt|fabsayc: funny seems to me both auctions kind of called for heart lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: now Thomas is asking about the written explan  now wants to call Director|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: written on paper that 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|ritong: and will certainly finesse @c J directly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Martel says lead may make no difference play hand|pg||
mc|12|nt|fabsayc: i dont care if partner did not double, i dont lead a spade, does partner double on k empty|pg||
nt|ritong: however, it loses versus stiff jack off|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: no further actions|pg||

pc|dK|nt|hlortz: notice if declarer gets to dummy he will start with 9@S to be able to repeat the finesse but yes he will likely just concede  a @S|pg||

nt|daman: how many strings on a bow?|pg||
nt|daman: I never took violin|pg||
nt|daman: or fiddle for that matter|pg||

nt|barnets: @DK @HAKQ if no brea@SA@SK|pg||

nt|othered1: I'm not sure that works|pg||
nt|hlortz: as i said b4 the crash lew should have covered the spade witht he 8 so martel not left on lead... tom made IMO a great play pitching|pg||
nt|othered1: agree and it may have made the contract for him, if he continues to read the hand correctly|pg||
nt|ritong: i think he has a very accurate idea about opps hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Thomas sitting very calmly|pg||
nt|ritong: except about the @cs|pg||
nt|ritong: but he needs @cs 3/2 to make, so..|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he has to play for essentially the actual layout, nothing else will yield 10 trick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no he does not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he needs to score two ruffs in dummy and four in hand (if no trump shift)|pg||
nt|ritong: aren t your two last sentences contradictory?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no north can have four clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: would still work|pg||

pc|s3|nt|athene: declarer would like to rise the @SQ so as to ruff with small trumps i guess|pg||

nt|poohbear: loses only to 6-1 clubs or 5-1 @h|pg||
nt|barnets: yes|pg||
nt|athene: I would have thought 2@S was the normal action on that East hand although of course it's easy to construct hands where you score a goal showing the hearts|pg||

nt|othered1: just look at the difference in evaluations of the east hand.|pg||
nt|kareno: At IMPs I prefer Bessis' evaluation|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ritong: and if he shifts to a @s, HH will score two swings of 4/3 partial in a row|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|Vugraphzfe: lots of writing|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|henryb:  a careful play, the @h5. From TD's perspective, partner might hold Q32|pg||
nt|ritong: and a trump|pg||
nt|othered1: It may be a function of what's a minimum opening, but still . . . |pg||
nt|hlortz: lew learned from the last hand overtake and play trump|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|kareno: It's still IMPs and looking at the east hand you have to think there will be a play for game in spades or hearts.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Losing Trick Count rarely steers yu wrong. iN followed by 3S would be conservative. 2S is reactionary|pg||

nt|ritong: doubling low level cues rarely is a good idea|pg||
nt|othered1: From west's perspective, south may well have better @D that run, so looking to beat 3N quickly isn't irrational.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, N did neg X|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ritong: on the other hand, either east has a @s honor and that establishes five quick tricks, or he hasn t and probably can offer some opposition in the other suits|pg||
nt|ritong: but, clearly, thomas went for the fast kill|pg||
nt|hlortz: back to that wierd 3N thomas made,, it was *very* hard for stansby/martel to visualize 10x for declarer's spase stopper so maybe that was the key to the strange result|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it was hard to visualize that on W bidding, but even harder to visualize the A on N bidding|pg||

nt|odysseus69: sorry again- mixing blacks- back to 800|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: whats to see all the cards again|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: In other room, Weinstein found amazing lead of low diamond against same 3@D contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: drop queen|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: thanks debbie|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: If West underleads and East shifts to a trump, declarer probably will go up king|pg||
nt|ritong: with east s overcall, south might well guess trump position|pg||
nt|hlortz: wont play w to have passed AK A|pg||
nt|ritong: that also|pg||
nt|kit: he will know where the ace is -- that's not the problem|pg||
nt|kit: it is the queen he wouldn't know where it was|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Vugraphzfe: screen down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: ? leads in the middle of the hand|pg||
nt|ritong: normal|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if spades 2-2 both 3nt and 4s making|pg||
pc|s2|nt|barnets: as long as west never leads a @S and covers the @SJ it is 800|pg||
nt|chick: ya, I wish the suits lined up opposite each other|pg||
pc|s7|nt|dinos1: 5 side tricks 3@h|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|barnets: Multon will play trump|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ritong: 14 with 2 boards to go is a huge advantage|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well 3nt needs a bit more actually|pg||
nt|ritong: since it means two swings|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Diamond had 135 today with out carry over|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||

nt|odysseus69: maybe he wont cover spade jack again|pg||
mc|9|nt|barnets: yes possible|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|poohbear: They had an accident in the @s suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|barnets: and e/w are making 3N|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|pef: wow, sounds like people are getting tired|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcwla: when S got in with @CQ, played 5 from remaning @S K-5 putting W on AT tight.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s8|nt|barnets: and there is a break in the closed room|pg||
nt|pef: interesting problem on this hand for west after garbage stayman whether to play in the stronger or weaker trump suit|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|pef: not always very clear.  do the rest of you think 2s is best by steve weinstein or would you pass 2h?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h8|nt|barnets: what was most remarkeable was that young Bessis thomas bid  n with no stoper in spades at all|pg||
pc|h3|nt|barnets: the opponents suit|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|barnets: he had 10x|pg||
nt|pef: well you should always play from the honor doubleton side, right :)|pg||
nt|barnets: and scored his 10 to start with when dummy had qxx|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|pef: specs are yelling at me with equal fervor that it was right to pass 2h and right to bid 2s|pg||
nt|athene: so he was right, he did have a spade stop|pg||
nt|barnets: so zimmerman no leads by 16 imps|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|barnets: with 6 boards to score|pg||
nt|pef: and of course another set are telling me they'd pass 1nt with east's hand|pg||
nt|dburn: tell the spectators to look up the Vondracek Effect|pg||
nt|bucheister: who?|pg||
nt|athene: someone who thought you should play in the weaker suit as trumps|pg||
nt|pef: it's certainly true that in many Moysian (4-3) fits, you'd much rather have the weak trumps in the 3-card side|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: yes, you don't want to waste big trumps by ruffing with them sometimes, but west wasn't expecting to get many ruffs in his hand|pg||
nt|pef: helness would have been better off playing a diamond at that point|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't really matter - declarer just has six losers whatever|pg||
nt|barnets: and on 59 thomas overcalled 1@S on QJ10x and has given n/s another problem|pg||
nt|pef: true, now north will probably get a heart ruff|pg||
nt|athene: it's possible NS might miss 3nt on board 59 if it starts 1@D (1@S overcall) i guess|pg||
nt|barnets: but they got to 3N|pg||
nt|pef: and fleisher has potential for a pickup on board 61 if e/w get too aggressive|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pc|h5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: ok, i spoke too soon :)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|dburn: rather, Fleisher has potential for a pickup if EW stay normally passive|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: Helness did need to switch to a diamond eventually|pg||
mc|8|nt|athene: setting up declarer's club for a diamond pitch was one tempo too many given away|pg||
pg||

nt|barnets: only 5 imps now|pg||
nt|ritong: hey brigidda, what about offering a good board to my mates?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|Vugraphzfe: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: two more to go in this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: Yes the french took a break and came back and have won some points afterwards|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: a relatively innocuous one here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|barnets: its a good idea to break after a poor board or 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Chip is staring at the box|pg||
nt|hlortz: 7 of the boards this set pushes not many major swings...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|barnets: e.w were allowed to make 2@S in open |pg||
nt|barnets: with 6 apparent losers|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Last I heard the Women Swiss was the Campanile team going into the last round no final winner know to us yet|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Just hearD Campanile won|pg||
nt|ritong: thomas will probably take the third @d and run the @h 8|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|barnets: I wuld bid 3N with south anyone else?|pg||
nt|ritong: or not|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|barnets: loooks like 4 imps to fleisher|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Stacy Jacobs was second|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|odysseus69: a kibitzer points out that 6d makes on c king lead-not a likely scenario|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: leads are 3/5th|pg||
pc|d7|nt|odysseus69: meanwhile in 3NT declarer has temporary worries which soon go away|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 2 minutes left in this set but will add 10 minute grace period|pg||
nt|dinos1: btw - wd u rebid 3@d or 3N?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
nt|dinos1: oh, sorry - didnt see above q :)|pg||
nt|pef: all the results for the women's and open swiss are on the acbl website  www.acbl.org and click on results for the Reno nationals|pg||
pc|h8|nt|chick: I may be in the minority, but I would open the S hand 1N,  solves a lot of rebid problems|pg||
nt|barnets: if north was to hold the @SJ @DJ and a king 3N is on finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would like to take this opportunity to thank everybody involved in this broadcast, especially Jan Martel for|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|dinos1: too strong hand for just 3@d|pg||
nt|kit: declarer lucky he doesn't have 10 of hearts, as if he did he might misguess hearts on the auction|pg||
nt|poohbear: http://www.acbl.org/nabc/results/2010/01/21/|pg||
nt|fabsayc: organizing all the operators, and Debbie Hyatt our hard working and excellent operator.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 2nd D'Olivio|pg||
nt|poohbear: same team|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: D'ovidio who was with Stacy Jacobs|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|barnets: perhaps they play weak nt but still|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: will restart at 6:00pm|pg||
nt|barnets: i would open1@D and rebid 2N|pg||
pc|cA|nt|barnets: dovidio is french too|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|chick: ok, they play weak NT, sorry|pg||
nt|ritong: somehow, yes|pg||
pc|d9|nt|dinos1: as F?|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like a good tournament for the french|pg||
pc|c6|pc|dJ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|ritong: i would agree|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: thinking|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|chick: but the same principle ... open 1@D, rebid whatever shows a 15-17 NT hand|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes fleisher showing him lots of high cards to tempt him if he had|pg||
mc|6|pg||

nt|bucheister: I would think that EW feel their session was solid enough for a win; |pg||
nt|pef: yes, fleisher needs 61 plus one more part score thing|pg||
nt|pef: at any rate|pg||
mc|9|nt|pef: Let's thank everyone involved with this amazing online event|pg||
