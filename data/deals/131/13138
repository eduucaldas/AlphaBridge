mb|5D|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 2@C is a tricky bid, now S will think his hand is worse than it is|pg||

nt|Gerben42: no entries for @C@D squeeze|pg||

nt|mcphee: W can go to work on @D|pg||
nt|MolvaM: diamonds work|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 3@S the limit now|pg||
mb|1H|nt|MolvaM: and west would know that diamonds are her best friend anyway|pg||
nt|eleni: Last board of this segment so see you in a few minutes|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|eleni: As we all know Bobolakis and George Karlaftis both are teams' players. They rarely risk their contracts|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|mcphee: N wants to bid more|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4@c is a good save|pg||
nt|mcphee: so is 3N:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: against 140|pg||
nt|tez: 3nt pls:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4@C bound to get dbled|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3N will not be|pg||
nt|eleni: 4@d would be a bad bid by Dimos|pg||
nt|tez: trust your partner:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt gets doubled faster|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but north would run probably|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|bmkl: no risk no return Eleni :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: you would be surprised if N dbled here and S bids 3N how often they save in 4@S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mcphee: S might have stepped in with 2@H here|pg||
nt|petrosa: another -1|pg||
nt|petrosa: bad luck|pg||
nt|liarakos: i am not sure|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mcphee: a little soft, but what the hect|pg||
mb|3H|nt|harmon: If declarer plays a high club from his hand south shd drop Q|pg||
mb|3S|nt|petrosa: Q@h|pg||
nt|petrosa: and many -|pg||
nt|liarakos: maybe x @H and many down|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: George you are right, Nick Perdikaris is an aggressive player:)|pg||
nt|ghionis: :)|pg||
nt|eleni: but in this case he decided to use the law of total tricks|pg||
nt|eleni: and it will work|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|MolvaM: yes we are surprised :)|pg||
nt|eleni: true, this is why on board 16 they lost an IMP|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tez: 1 down|pg||
nt|mcphee: things lay well for declarer|pg||
nt|liarakos: 5@H x in the open|pg||
pc|d2|nt|eleni: a wild bidding:)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|liarakos: -2 probably so 11 imps to Levi|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mcphee: W overstepped hi bounds with this 4@S bid|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|mcphee: good point, but as @D run nothing helps|pg||
nt|eleni: 3dx=|pg||
nt|harmon: true I just pointed it out cause Stevo did that to me to beat me, I almost got it right cause it was Stevo|pg||
pc|s9|nt|eleni: not this board:):) that was for the operator of the other table:):) board 5@h|pg||
nt|eleni: in the open room E-W on this one scored +1 for 450|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|tez: w shld not decide here|pg||
nt|mcphee: not sure what he was thinking, but this is not what you do|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|MolvaM: now we know that west is a certified overbidder|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|ghionis: bad timing for altinis he went down in this|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mcphee: so reccomended is Q@C now not 10:)|pg||
nt|harmon: rofl yup|pg||
nt|jcone: no chance of Queen play now|pg||
nt|mcphee: which would have a good shot had he overcalled:)|pg||
nt|lelos: another 4 imps for altinis here since 9 tricks are easy|pg||
pc|h6|nt|liarakos: oops|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s6|nt|rodal f: ? Kill the cat. And @S|pg||
nt|lelos: not very carefull play by coach|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|tez: with a bal hand with  defensive values in @d and limit opening hand|pg||
nt|MolvaM: they are sweet ladies remember|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I guess east had an opinion about 4@H|pg||
pc|d6|mc|9|nt|MolvaM: so they expect their opps to be polite in defence|pg||
nt|eleni: no way to save the -1:(|pg||
nt|bmkl: -2 maybe|pg||
nt|bmkl: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Thanks all, see you in about 15 min :)           @H|pg||
