nt|vugraphzeg: EW play natural, I think|pg||
nt|frankaus: not me  - 4 @S  would tempt me|pg||
nt|frankaus: then i'm a senior|pg||
nt|szalay: match starts with a boring 3N|pg||
nt|haans: doomed|pg||
mb|p|nt|VugraphPl1: http://michzimny.pl/bridge/2010/pila/gp.html|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 3NT    but hardly bidable|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=80&Itemid=72  for participants |pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW have 9 tricks as the cards are placed, agree.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: 2@H open room so will be a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: do we have running scores Jacco?|pg||

nt|haans: clubs lead?|pg||
nt|haans: best|pg||
nt|ady: even on the lead will go down on a heart switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: well EW can make 6@D|pg||
mb|p|pc|c3|nt|szalay: ok, u can try 6@D, but its terrible...long run I dont suggest slams with 30 hcp and 2 balanced hands|pg||
nt|szalay: bid your games, take your tricks (by Hamman) is good advice in any level|pg||
nt|sybarra: I take it this is the "slam try" sequence |pg||
nt|szalay: with aceless 11, with Qx @C I wd just say 3N, confess|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I think east made a slamtry here, that is what i heard from the explanation from west|pg||
nt|szalay: a bit starnge 3@C rebid except its forcing (doubt it) with 9 top tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: nope it works now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East and West doÂ´nt play the same system here|pg||
nt|haans: not in agrement here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would RD there onstead of 2@d, 2ndly i would definitely start with 1@h|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D show support|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|ady: west should know on the 2 lead that north has 5 clubs|pg||
nt|haans: whappen happened her|pg||
nt|frankaus: 15 2 H in pd major - pd opens - how many will stay short of game?|pg||
nt|haans: non vul yes |pg||
nt|haans: you need 50% to bid game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: my sys card is 2/1 - so it's impossible to stop before game with EW hands|pg||
pc|c5|nt|szalay: if it was slamtry, West wd accept for sure|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he and his mother Miss Anita are BBO players|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: costs nothing to put up the q |pg||
pc|dA|nt|haans: flat board|pg||
nt|ady: cash to clubs puts pressure on west   has to discard a heart   but still down 1|pg||
nt|haans: are they playing Magic Diamond?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|szalay: personally I wd open West as 2N, if it starts at 20...7 controls, 4 tricks|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|sQ|pc|d9|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|frankaus: if !K off side even 9 may be hard to come by|pg||
nt|h_karluk: some pairs play support doubles and redoubles, a matter of style|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|haans: Magic Diamond 1@S 8-12 hcp|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: tried for Q and 10 of diamonds on side  |pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I lost track went too fast. Both north and south kept the right ones\|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|c8|nt|h_karluk: @h AK + @h wld b a nice move, then overrruf and a spade, ruff etc|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|frankaus: hoping that guess is wrong here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hard to underlead from A, so imho cld play for a hook|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||

nt|roswolf: a junior raise in the other room|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, big gain for Norway|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: 1NT with that East hand??|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: In both rooms|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|roswolf: yup and may lead to a similar result|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: What does 1@D followed by 2@C show?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  they all are on the start of collecting thier practical experience|pg||
nt|roswolf: really that punt has nothing to commend it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe it changed since I was young 97 years ago|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sfoxa:  why not to open 1NT with such hand or Multy with 11 ponts in ace and 2 kings  |pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: Dennis already has a good set|pg||
nt|sharkey: :) - the important things Hans|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Director at the table asking Jackson about a score in the previous round|pg||
nt|haans: endplay in hearts possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: last board was 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: sorry for missing the last bid |pg||
nt|h_karluk: np|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|szalay: if u go to normal games: go as fast as u can...dont give them chance to interfere|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably a preemptive @D raise coming |pg||
nt|szalay: why not 4@H with passed pd?|pg||
nt|frankaus: Ax no the best stopper in the world often better played from Qx side|pg||
nt|szalay: slam is unlikely, @H are good, so?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but unlikely to keep e/w out of 4 @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: you had the one with the picture |pg||
nt|sharkey: appears 4@S can be made - however, may have transportation problems|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    n/s may be able to stop in 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the website|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 12 tricks for me....previous hand|pg||
mb|2H|nt|frankaus: looks like a 30 point deck to E |pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far EW 5@c-1 and NS 4@s -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: then we understand|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: and E with 4333....|pg||
nt|szalay: wd u bid 5@D over 1@D-4@H-?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may go 2 @H all pass |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes but that is a blog|pg||
nt|ady: n/s likely to play 2@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would even not try it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Standings after 2 rounds: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=85&Itemid=79|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: after 3 rounds actuallly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but i would rebid 1N as West|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: interesting 1NT|pg||
mb|4H|nt|yuval10: 4@s is some bid by N, P has a very good support though|pg||
nt|yuval10: and now probably bid 5@s ?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Gembick's pass??|pg||
nt|haans: 1n bye North?|pg||
nt|haans: nopåe|pg||
nt|haans: not a nice bid when vul|pg||
nt|sharkey: They've landed in their best strain|pg||
nt|ady: north 2@D rebid very respectable|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ir 2 @C all pass |pg||
nt|haans: 2@D must be 6-carder|pg||
nt|ady: unfortunately may well go down |pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: why not double by South?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2254 and 15|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: best spot for n/s is clubs  but unable to get there|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|frankaus: traffic light is red pays to be conservative|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well what do I know |pg||
nt|haans: 4@H young bidding|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this time black Kings are not favorably placed|pg||
pc|d6|nt|szalay: e-w gave them all the chance|pg||
nt|xenya: they might get to a hopeless slam now -- and they did|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S?  rkk ? |pg||
nt|szalay: u can beat 5@C if u play some special (lavinthal, roman) signal over A of @S|pg||
nt|haans: E dont fool me|pg||
pc|d5|nt|szalay: I think first step to trap was 1@H...after that they came deeper and deeper|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: seemed like a cuebid auction to me|pg||

nt|sybarra: it is a reburbished tennis club,  (still active tennis courts)  and a wonder bridge facility |pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: yes agree should be 6 card suit  but AQ to 6 and 2 outside aces is top weight|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: and they are playing with screens |pg||

nt|Walddk2: 2@C or 1@S response with that hand?|pg||

nt|vugraphzef: tournament director is here because of the explanation of the dubble after 4 d |pg||

nt|haans: slam?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yuval10: NS will make a lot of tricks here|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: but E did bid 5@C -- seems that's what W was eager to hear|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: South could have 18+ balanced or any 5-4, passing would be a gamble|pg||
nt|yuval10: cards lie very favourable for them|pg||
nt|h_karluk: umm, slam time for NS|pg||
mb|2C|mb|4D|nt|sharkey: a + score is good here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4/4 or 5/3, in other words which black suit slam :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|szalay: I think a tipical mistake to correct in junior age by coach(es): stop slam-greedy|pg||
nt|sybarra: they keep skipping the @S suit, but it is 4333   |pg||
nt|szalay: the imp score is done for GAMES, from both directions|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 21/19 and North lonely cowboy now|pg||
nt|pelu: for me 1NT or 2Nt!|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht 1NT better from north|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C not forcing|pg||
mb|d|nt|h_karluk: and whichever suit you pick things not much easy |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 2@c now cbs- i suppose|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS past their comfort zone |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: South explained when asked that 3@c shows a good hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: I like 1 NT instead of 3@C|pg||
nt|pelu: sh for sure be a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@D will make life difficult|pg||
nt|haans: not easy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think experienced players would thank to 4@d overcall that alarmed about there's a highly distributional layout|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|haans: but what to lead|pg||
nt|frankaus: i like X here - (t/o) do something sensible |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: south altered 2c, north didnt|pg||

nt|xenya: and Jacco :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Jacco's may be better |pg||
nt|sybarra: mine is participants I see |pg||
nt|szalay: in my book 3@D is NOT forcing, so dunno why West bid on|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Nort has just 5 losers, however no entry to table|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: e-w has their 3rd dangerous bidding so far|pg||
nt|haans: i play 3@C as a prempt|pg||
nt|haans: many beginners believe all new suit bids are forcing even when reponers first say = have weak hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: put me down as a pass with Wests hand - aceless 4333 even with 14 i would pass|pg||
nt|szalay: double by South?|pg||

pc|s2|nt|h_karluk: depends agreements just use 2@d or 2@h, and make things easier|pg||
pc|s3|nt|szalay: to bid games, take tricks...and double games when they r in vuln and we see the chance|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i agree with 3@c rebid, invite or better, i can live with that 5 losers, no matter entry to table, i know no need to cry when they sets, favorable vuln was another tempting factor|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: they even played after the claim..|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rnmalik: can they make 6@D|pg||
mb|d|nt|h_karluk: uh oh. 1@s ? hmmm :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sharkey: 3 NT|pg||
mb|2H|nt|szalay: terrible slam, imho|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a @C can be pitched on @S but they dont know:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: dont they play Drury?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: During the white house juniors very nice weather last few years|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Dennis Bilde had his moment on the first board. now 1 highpoint average over 3|pg||
nt|haans: best game 3nt but ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: water? - do u know what fish do in water :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: those hands are usually easy to bid :)|pg||
nt|ady: natural    should have had a 5th club|pg||
nt|haans: no way to show @D :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: how about pass :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: he already had 3@c in his hand..|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: practically|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: kibs asking 6@D      can make    but bad contract  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: no way|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: but last moment rethink :P|pg||
pc|dA|nt|szalay: I think 9 hcp with ruffing values is more than regular 10 hcp|pg||

nt|haans: clubs lead ?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|rnmalik: agree was an observation|pg||
nt|pelu: 9½ out of 10 will lead @S|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|pelu: ½ lead @d! :)|pg||
nt|ady: natrual spade lead 9 tricks    this likely to be a swing for Australia|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All results (including butlers and hand records) at www.nbbportal.nl/1003/ > 'competitie'|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|szalay: important thing after bad boards: leave table for a while and reconnect:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: All Israels I know play drury, maybe west didnt think his hand was good enough\|pg||
nt|ady: club lead will need spades 3-3 to pitch losing club   and heart lead will need king well placed|pg||
nt|sybarra: wrongsided this one|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3nt will make with the   @HJshort|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzeg: kleine kamer|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think an imaginary problem there : say east has AQ96-KT983-7-J42, okay guys, would bid 1@h or still double over 1@d? my opinion : if East wld X with that  hand then 2@d cue by W ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: gr8 :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Probably take @C finesse and end up with 11 tricks|pg||

nt|szalay: touch and go 4@H|pg||
nt|szalay: it will makes if trump by opps: no option just staright @C hook|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 20-20 1st time there|pg||
nt|pelu: strong 2@C and positiv response - if East can show 4 controls - easy way to 6|pg||
nt|haans: not me but 1NT = 4 controls|pg||
nt|ady: 4 hearts fails with K@D wrong|pg||
mb|1S|nt|h_karluk: 24-16 again partscore|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: 5431 is a good treatment|pg||
nt|szalay: Poles invented 5431-convention|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East will welcome a @S-opening + do.-support|pg||
nt|haans: not 2 aces K = 1 contraol Ace 2|pg||
nt|haans: all may be in @D'|pg||
mb|1N|nt|szalay: jump to 3M means: stiff major, 3card other major|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: (no entry back after ruffing finesse)|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: especially usefull if u open 1N with 5card M|pg||
mb|2D|nt|frankaus: true but transfer then bid game what do u loose?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 1N then 2@s good, so you can play direct 2@s raise 8-10|pg||
nt|haans: x with void can be costly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@c rebid then 2@s rebid, so all pass would also be nice|pg||
mb|2H|nt|szalay: routin 3N is coming|pg||
nt|szalay: so here 1N-3@H-4@S|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6@S as they lay|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: if no trump lead/switch: he will ruff a @D|pg||
nt|frankaus: now is X pen?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: so 2 @S transfer to minor? |pg||
nt|szalay: but they wont bid with missing ace and trump queen|pg||
nt|pelu: over 4@C and no @D-cue West would know|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@H is a very poor game. It requires more than the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|haans: poerknight: yea but if u hear 4 controls and see 3 kings in ur hand it can only be 2 aces and riye he is|pg||
nt|pelu: so NL on the scoreboard|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i think passive trump lead auto there|pg||
nt|szalay: best defence is: cash 3 winners and @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - West should know pd's loaded; however, with 4 HCP too weak|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and maybe @h3 would give a better idea - say 3/5 leads thoroughout in sys card|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i did not get that 2@h|pg||
pc|c2|nt|szalay: in my book that is a slamtry in M, balanced|pg||
nt|szalay: to lose balanced slamtry with 6bagger is gap, anyway|pg||
nt|yuval10: now declarer can play A and Q@c discarding @s|pg||
nt|szalay: no ruffing finesse is suggested|pg||
nt|szalay: no 100% line, and could be lead from doubleton, but that is the best line, imho|pg||
nt|h_karluk: because you have 2 aces and 3 times trumps, whenever you are in can easily work to cut a ruff|pg||
nt|haans: many do not pen until opps reach game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: while found 5/2 @s fit why he got risk , hard question to reply|pg||
nt|davidb: easy  X  by N  -Ns  at least 6 trumps & more points|pg||
nt|haans: pass on 1nt = balanced hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: F1N not in sys?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: Poland got the 11 imps back quickly, when they stopped in game on 2 (6@H was the contract here) |pg||
nt|ady: north minimum  lacking aces   and wasted K@H  definately should settle for game|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk4: Even on that lead, and with hearts 3-2, it can't make|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|szalay: I think South could bid 4@H with 3 aces over 3@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that would help East to see South has only a @h card|pg||

nt|frankaus: X do something sensible is a reasonable call |pg||
nt|sybarra: agressive?|pg||
nt|szalay: its normal, imho|pg||
nt|xenya: is it penalty?|pg||

nt|szalay: 8-10, bid sthg, imho|pg||
nt|szalay: I doubt it|pg||
nt|frankaus: no here  - opps bid & raise  X = t/o|pg||
nt|szalay: btw if South passes and North bids @C a BIT easier, but isnt easy yet|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but makes with a lucky @d hook|pg||
pc|h6|nt|szalay: I think North can double 4@S quite confidently|pg||

pc|c3|nt|hawe45:  Dangerous double - no defence against 4 @C|pg||

nt|ady: was 11 imps for world team|pg||
nt|rnmalik: compensation here for NS might gain some|pg||
nt|pelu: 4 out of 5 : I am junior :):)|pg||
nt|haans: psych|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could also play for divided @d honours|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems preferred 3-3 35/6 %|pg||
nt|haans: 4th 5th spade|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sharkey: we can follow jacco - just finsih the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: true but the other table played the hand it was supposed to be played|pg||
nt|sharkey: Makes on low @C lead...|pg||
nt|haans: opinion: gronkvist: they must cancel the board gronkvist: will the laws says so|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|szalay: u wont punish for light openings cause light overcalls and vica versa|pg||
nt|szalay: why not to take @C in hand?|pg||
nt|szalay: to start @D ruff?|pg||
nt|frankaus: maybe planning on a dummy reversal|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|sybarra: he may be thinking same thing,  maybe played too fast |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Now they're all saying I'm junior to me :P|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzeg: I could led the right guy lead but he led small club|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I love how 3/10 are people I know|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @d K ?? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yep|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pelu: the problem are not 13-14 HCP - but the bad suit|pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: ok sir, thanks :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: now K@C and club|pg||
nt|h_karluk: okay, say you entered the score, it helps to see in comparison? |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, seriously i do not think we can have ideal conditions at all times|pg||
nt|h_karluk: how they say? umm - lesser evil <my review>|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's what pre-empts are for, but I don't think Edgtton had a serious problem with that hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: soon east would be endplayed with a careful timing|pg||
nt|haans: opps in the dark|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|szalay: to take trick first and think thereafter isnt a good omen|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: why not pitch ht|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is that the exit card?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H pitchwas better but kept an exit card|pg||
pc|s9|nt|szalay: why Ten?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that was the question|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d6|nt|szalay: but first: make plan, move after that|pg||
nt|ady: down 4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|haans: @H7 =========== no|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|h_karluk: and i did not get why declarer refused unblock in @d suit|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|sybarra: apparently only 3 |pg||
pc|s8|pc|hT|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|sharkey: EW finally had some luck - then the board will be cancelled....|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|roswolf: north sould double|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this deal appeals to hot temperament of youngsters )))|pg||
nt|roswolf: south may well pass|pg||

nt|szalay: it looks an interesting 3N|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!|pg||
nt|szalay: does West have way to show @D lead?|pg||
nt|szalay: or may be HIS lead, even better:)|pg||
nt|ady: if west is on lead to 3NT  may choose a heart when east has shown majors|pg||
nt|szalay: a bit optimistic, but acceptable 5@C|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 7/5/1 long time not seen|pg||
nt|haans: 1@C mbs?|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@s in OR = 5 card @S + a minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: thanks all, esp fellow commentators & operator|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are back in about 1/2 hour |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes play went very fast here so that is why|pg||
nt|szalay: fast play seldom means good|pg||
nt|frankaus: fine operating Jacco <clap> <clap> <clap> <clap>|pg||
nt|szalay: I think South has INV with @Cs, lets say 3@C is normal or 2N...|pg||
nt|pelu: by West|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: it was west thinking but i try to do 2 bids at a time|pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks like it should make |pg||
nt|szalay: r u sure?|pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder|pg||
nt|szalay: 1@S, 1@H and how many @Cs?|pg||
nt|ady: looks like west has mis understood partners bid|pg||
nt|szalay: its Molenaar's double session|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: west might have explained this as weak with @d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: imho 5@c unbelievable|pg||
nt|haans: 3 down in 5@Cx|pg||
nt|haans: 2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C is not an overbid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could any lead a trump from QT - say to 5 clubs contract? :)|pg||
nt|haans: 3@Dx|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: possibly 3@s would come|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: I think its going down for @S lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes!!  here we go again|pg||
nt|szalay: 6@C for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: East wasnt passing, I could tell you that|pg||
nt|xenya: E seems to have taken partner's 4@C too seriously|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what would you lead vs 5@c ? @h A/K or @s A+x ? :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT the easiest as they lay    but likely to play 5@C  which would certainly go down to a trump lead   4@H can make|pg||
nt|haans: at last|pg||
pc|cT|nt|yuval10: E likes his hand|pg||
nt|haans: game at or|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i do not believe my eyes, 4261 with 6 hcp and 3@d 3rd seat both nonvul :)|pg||
nt|davidb: not a  lucky decision |pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: dbl gazzili like bid?|pg||
nt|ady: not likely to play 4@H|pg||
nt|frankaus: have you heard my view on playing 5 minor contracts?|pg||
nt|ady: managed 3NY OR|pg||
nt|ady: OR|pg||
nt|h_karluk: esp when N showed his interest on unbid suits (the reds)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry there were a huge misjudgement|pg||
pc|c9|nt|szalay: if u travel across the World, better to agree 2suiter overcalls|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: the problem was the semi natural 1@c openingbid i think|pg||
nt|szalay: if a bid (semi)natural, better to treat it as natural, eg. to play (1m)-2m as Michaels vs. prepared 1m yet|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to misguess hts here also |pg||
nt|h_karluk: obviously - east players happy with that 7 hcp|pg||
nt|yuval10: maybe too much for a 4-3-3-3 hand|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|szalay: but grand slam try with missing ace was a mistake, anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 1430, I guess|pg||
nt|xenya: admittedly, he does have a great hand|pg||
nt|szalay: nbo pressure for N-S now|pg||
nt|szalay: the real issue is 3m is nat or stopper asking|pg||
nt|haans: not to happy with @H lead|pg||
nt|ady: in what   4@H?|pg||
nt|haans: nt|pg||
nt|frankaus: its like kissing your own sister - even when its right ---- its hard to get excited about your prospects|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|szalay: time for @S switch yet, and likely 2 off|pg||
nt|szalay: c u in 30 minutes|pg||
nt|szalay: byebye|pg||
nt|pelu: now 25-0 could be 25-24!|pg||
nt|haans: hung is trying to show his strength|pg||
nt|ady: yes Netherlands good comeback|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If he thinks he has that strong a hand, why did he not reverse into 2@H?|pg||
nt|ady: well the 2 club rebid did not exactly convey the hand|pg||
nt|haans: his opinion for a long time|pg||
nt|davidb: to leave the X . 3D  is ok for  juniors openings|pg||
pc|s6|nt|h_karluk: thanks, you interpreted my feelings :)|pg||
nt|szalay: it will be push, thx all, c u soon|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thx buddy, c ya soon|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|haans: once again holy ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a-ha North pushes his opps to game|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@C er helt ude i hampen|pg||
nt|frankaus: may escape  with -2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|sharkey: Sac vs 3@H?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there were a passed hand double and imho showed @h+@d|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem is that the X from = @H, so 2@h is what??|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe that's too simple|pg||
nt|haans: we have said neither|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: this stands no chance of course -- let's see if he can get out for -1|pg||
nt|ady: high spade likely lead|pg||
nt|pelu: some play after opp has shown 2 suits, that a bid here is sopper and no stopper in the other suit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hope they make postmortem especially about this board|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: sorry for speaking Danish|pg||
nt|h_karluk: makeable now|pg||
nt|haans: small @D????????????????|pg||
nt|ady: win and duck a heart  will make|pg||
pc|h4|nt|frankaus: bed time here back latter in day european time|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes this happened, north couldnt play south for 4@D|pg||
nt|xenya: i doubt that -- W's clubs are too small|pg||
nt|xenya: setting up @Ds would mean seetting up trump tricks for N|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu frank @H |pg||
nt|xenya: but i overlooked the fact that the defence had presented E with a trick -- now he certainly can make 11 and must be thinking how to get 12  |pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: can establish spades    but has no trump control|pg||
nt|h_karluk: !k was the lead i expected|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h K|pg||
nt|sharkey: Actually first time the Danes made a "crazy" bid this match I think|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however their maters scored +620|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *mates|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|ady: world team made 600 in OR   so anything under down 4 is a plus|pg||
nt|szalay: 2 or 3 down is the question now|pg||
nt|haans: 1 down?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: today what i saw preempts really bended a lot, that's like a double edge sword, tomorrow could not be the same|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: it looks so close... -- but can't be managed i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: very close,  pity for E the clubs do not break |pg||
nt|szalay: 3 off: -5 imp|pg||
pc|dA|nt|szalay: 2 off: +3|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  has to be less than 3 down |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Lets say J@S and @DA and another @D would reduce losses somewhat|pg||
nt|szalay: if he leads @H to king: -5|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||
nt|VugraphPl1: 100%|pg||
nt|haans: why jump up|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: or spades 4/3 |pg||
pc|c5|nt|h_karluk: bye|pg||
nt|ritong: no matter what, simply raise whenever possible  here, the 1 @s bid left them in 3@h with a close to slam hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty all - bye|pg||
nt|haans: next match 50 minutes|pg||
pc|s8|nt|h_karluk: crazy layout, home sweet home|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: who is most supried|pg||
pc|d8|nt|szalay: well played|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ady: so just a 1 imps loss to Australia|pg||
mc|7|nt|haans: bye all|pg||
