mb|2S|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|jbgood: very "unfortunate" that the defense had so good spades against 6 NT|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|warrens:  if North plays a heart at trick 2, this is not simple|pg||
nt|jbgood: could be on for 7 if W has the @s ace, so I think 5 @h was cue accepting clubs, and 5 NT interested in grand but denying spade ace|pg||
nt|othered1: east ruffs D, if he reads the position and with @C10 coming down  . . . |pg||

mb|1C|an|strong|mb|p|nt|dburn: seemed better to pitch a club on the third heart, then play a spade|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dinos1: better to play @s to J and set 5th @d|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4D!|nt|dinos1: 100% line coz def didnt lead @c to that moment|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: this is a fair slam, but again the play is not straightforward|pg||
nt|dburn: and nor is the bidding - not quite sure what Passell intends here|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dburn: no doubt 4@d is Blackwood for clubs, but...|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@d was? @crkcb?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: I will forward any explanations I can read or overhear|pg||
nt|dburn: ...that seems a little odd with no control in either of the unbid suits|pg||

mb|p|mb|6N|nt|dburn: well, North will be confident at this point|pg||

nt|stewball: attack|pg||
pc|sK|nt|warrens:  Becker's too wise to double.  if they ran, his partner would have to guess what suit to lead against 7@C|pg||
nt|stewball: very curious|pg||
nt|dburn: he cannot be sure of beating 7@c, so he will probably let it go|pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: irritation showing|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|dinos1: not a good start for EW in this segment|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|dinos1: 2@d - GF checkback|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: this is not the worst 6@d in the world, and it will make on this lie of cards, but bidding it will be quite a feat|pg||
nt|dinos1: one more minor slam|pg||
nt|dinos1: now 2N - 3@d?|pg||
nt|dburn: especially since up to now, diamonds have not actually been bid at all|pg||
nt|dburn: if East bids 3@d now, they have some sort of chance, but...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: lynch folds her hand, crosses her arms, looks at her cards again|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|dburn: ...well, she bid it|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dinos1: well - W has good hand for pd|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: kibitzer asks Passell for permission to sit behind him - normally no one bothers to ask|pg||
nt|dinos1: side aces and KJ in trump suit|pg||
nt|stewball: and a legit @d suit|pg||
nt|dburn: not clear what 3@h is - 4@d would have been clearer to East, but Passell may intend to support diamonds at a later stage|pg||
nt|dinos1: @sJ wd be golden )|pg||
nt|stewball: i think 3@h is a punt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: carolyn still working it out|pg||
nt|dburn: Lynch not clear what it is either - if I were West it would show worry about clubs for 3NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: strul examining EW system card|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3@s now, no?|pg||
nt|dburn: but in any case East seems to have a 3@s bid and let the chips fall|pg||
mb|3S|nt|dinos1: now 4@c|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: yes, seems to cover all possibilities|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|dburn: no doubt Passell intends that as keycard for diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: but I confess that if I were East, the whole thing would be a complete mystery to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: strul writing a question then puts his pen on top so I can't read|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if East can work it out the final contract will be 6@d, but if she can't, there is the horrid possibility that it might be 4@h|pg||
nt|dinos1: I was await 4@c cue, but 4@h - it's above me|pg||
nt|chick: have to admit, I'd figure W for a lot of hearts right about now|pg||
nt|dinos1: mb it's @d rkcb? :)|pg||
nt|dburn: I ma sure that it is, but East is not sure at all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: the alerted 4@D previously and alerted 4@H here suggest EW are playing kickback over minors|pg||
nt|dinos1: but why E is thinking so long?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: but now that you mention it, I didn't see lynch alert 4@H when the tray came through|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: NS both holding their cards below the table and looking down|pg||
nt|chick: I wonder if they are using the old rule that says cards have to be played on the same day they are dealt?  :)|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a tough position for Carolyn Lynch - the spectators all know what West's bidding means, and so do North, South, West and I|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: kibitzer H. Lall seems to have fallen asleep|pg||
nt|chick: does this count for sominex coup?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sorry I can't get any read from carolyn, behind her shoulder so I can't see her face.  she's sitting very still this whole time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: strul gestures like he can't believe what's going on|pg||
nt|dburn: she may be wondering why, if partner did not bid Blackwood over 3@d,he can bid it over 3@s|pg||
nt|dinos1: better was cue 4@c and let E ask with 4@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: passell: carolyn, you've got to do something.  this is just ridiculous|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|stewball: hang around for autographs|pg||
mb|1H|nt|gambit: will their flirt with 6@D?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|chick: think they will find 6@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: how about 7|pg||
nt|dinos1: 7@d isnt good but 6 is excellent|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|warrens:  I think the question is, will they find 7?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|dburn: seven probably not with the odds - seems to need two 3-2 breaks|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|dburn: but maybe some 4-1 diamond breaks can be handled|pg||
nt|dinos1: in 7 both mm's shd be 3-2 (or 3@d4@c in 1 hand)|pg||
nt|gambit: LOL, Stewy you make me laugh, and that (as Martha says - is a good thing), I think we forget that it is so easy seeing all hands, these players deserve our praise, they play at the ...|pg||
nt|gambit: top, and btw I did ask Eric Murray, Sami Kehela and Roy Hughes to Autorgraph Roy's book - for me dad. He was thrilled. |pg||
nt|dburn: but the break-even point for a grand slam is around the percentage chance of one 3-2 break (a little over 68%)|pg||
nt|stewball: thats what \i'm here for:)|pg||
nt|dinos1: Strul will continue with 4@c|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|dinos1: )))|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: so, if you need a 3-2 break plus some handling, you should not be in seven|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: strul has been very composed throughout.  can't read what he's thinking, no indication he was about to take this leap|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dinos1: he has strong indication pd has stiff @h|pg||
nt|dburn: unless of course you are GIB, which would make seven without breaking sweat (not that software can sweat, but...)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|gambit: Presuambly 2C rebid adds some integrity to the @D suit |pg||
nt|dinos1: thk 2@c showed 5-4 in mm's|pg||
nt|gambit: could it be 4-5?|pg||
