nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone and welcome back to Reno in Nevada for the annual Vanderbilt Knockout Teams. Quarter-finals, four segments of 16 boards; this is the second|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My fellow commentators are Bill Frisby, Bill Jacobs and Mikael Westerlund|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Good evening Mikael and Bill|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: Betheau-Nyström play a rather complicated strong club system with lots of relays|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: 16+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'll try to get a CC|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikael_w: good evening|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Both defenders have a natural club lead against the likely 3NT.|pg||

pc|hK|nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|brolucius: North offers a choice of games by making a transfer response (2@D) and then bidding 3NT.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/OpenTeams/Sweden/bertheau-nystrom.pdf|pg||
nt|athene: Only eight tricks on a club lead; declarer might try to sneak one heart through and then run for home|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: Only eight tricks, as we see.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The N-S system is natural more or less. 1@C wither natural or a 17-19 NT. Transfer responses|pg||
nt|mikael_w: there is alot to do, but seems to me as it always make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We usually have lots of Davids commentating, now a couple of Bills. Welcome to both of you|pg||
nt|mikael_w: offcurse best def now is to take the @hA as everybody can se|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Frisby and Jacobs|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Hi all|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think Fredin already decide to take the A, but now think about the return|pg||
nt|athene: hi welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|mikael_w: A and a @d is a realy great def now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: this pace is great for operator, torture for viewers|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: A kibitzer points out to me that there are three makable games and 3NT is not amongst them.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oops|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: Defenders will often hold up instinctively when declarer plays on dummy's long suit, unless they can see the setting tricks for sure.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Dan Bylund from Sweden. He should be able to talk us through the N-S methods|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|sK|nt|diaoff: hi all|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, the contract could still make, as the defenders can never untangle 5 tricks, but it would take fine card reading from declarer|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bjacobs: This looks a bit easier for declarer|pg||
pc|dK|nt|warrens:  they've blocked the  clubs,so this makes now|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mikael_w: am I wrong ? was it not always down if Fredin took @hA and return a @d to K and another @d|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think it still makes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Clear the heart, club king, then just play on spades|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bjacobs: But as noted, it requires declarer to pick the eyes out of it|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|athene: West didn't want to unblock - it might be costly if it was declarer rather than his partner who had the long clubs, of course.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, West could not read the club position. Perhaps he should have thought about it for longer.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is certainly an incredibly demanding hand|pg||

nt|Walddk2: We know there is a typo in the NS team name (should be De Knijff). We can't change it now, sorry|pg||
nt|warrens:  Zaleski returned original 4th best at trick 2.  some players return lowest from 5 because it's easier for partner to read|pg||
nt|mikael_w: a realy nice first board anyway, intresting for sure|pg||
nt|bjacobs: too interesting|pg||
nt|athene: 6@C here might be findable|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|athene: after 1@C - 1@H; 2@D west can really value his @CQJ|pg||
mb|1H|nt|brolucius: Yes, but then West would have no reason to unblock.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fredin is going to bid spades|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: But that is no obstacle|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@C next|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That should show the hand, more or less|pg||
mb|4C|nt|brolucius: At the other table North was declarer. East led a club, the king winning. declarer took five diamonds and the top spades, then played a heart. Up went the ace and the defenders ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: claimed the remainder.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Swedish team holds a unique record at this point. They have won every single quarter until now!|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Looks like it will come down to the blackwood soon to decide the level|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: west might be a bit worried his partner has 2-0-4-7 perhaps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What does 4@H mean here?|pg||
nt|athene: they could be off the @SAK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They could. What is 4@H now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need to have an agreement, for sure|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|athene: Sure but it wouldn't hurt - if West thinks his partner probably has four, but might have five, he can unblock much more happily than if he isn't sure if it's 3 or 5.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Still seems a bit risky to me. Is that common practice?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, it would be nice if you knew 100% partner would take 4@H as a cue for spadse|pg||
nt|athene: spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and presumably 3@H over 2@D would be natural and GF, so why wouldn't he?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I think this was question was the key to the auction |pg||
nt|Walddk2: What would 4@H be for you, guys when preceded by 2@S?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: no blackwood there|pg||
nt|athene: a cue for clubs sorry|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bjacobs: There are a number of aspects to this question, Roland|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: First, do E/W play any gadget after a reverse after a 1-over-1?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In particular, what is 2@H over 2@D?  What is 3@H over 2@D?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I guess 2 @s was GF ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do they play strong jump shift is also an important issue as David Greenwood points out|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If 2@H is natural and weak, then West might have to bid 2@S to start the forcing auction.  Then 4@H later might be natural|pg||
nt|Walddk2: De Knijff-Wrang bid the slam next door|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|athene: Well as a couple of people have pointed out, if East really did hold only three clubs, declarer surely wouldn't have played them like that.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sweden off to a flyer, as happened in the first set|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The moral to this is: you need to discuss Reverse auctions with your partner.  You don't see a lot about it in the literature, which is a shame|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|c5|nt|bjacobs: In the other room, it seems West just punted.  In a way, that auction was no better than this one.  It just got a bigger score.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|d9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If 2@S is game-forcing, as I think it is, 4@C sets clubs in my view|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Seems fair.  "You had your chance to bid hearts again partner"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "When you don't, I name CLUBS as trumps"|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||

nt|lml: the play wont take long once declarer gets in|pg||

nt|buffytvs: when clubs don't break, he will have to decide whether to try to cash 2 more hearts or play on diamonds|pg||

nt|lml: but trying to get 3 hearts through?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: A Fredin overcall|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He must have read Sabine Auken's book|pg||
nt|athene: Fredin obviously agrees with Sabine Auken that a 2@C overcall over 1@D is a good thing to do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: "Get in with 2@C over 1@D as often as possible"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, but that bid is essentially a psyche|pg||

mb|2N!|an|!C raise|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, a friend of mine (Marc Smith) co-wrote that book. It's good.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: I am impressed if you understand Swedish, John|pg||
mb|4D|nt|warrens:  a good preemptive raise, we'll see if E comes in or not|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Paul Hackett|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|warrens:  a great steal -50 versus a vul game|pg||
nt|athene: Bidding 4@H in these auctions usually pushes opps into 4@S, but here the colours slowed West down a bit.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Sabine and Peter just chatting|pg||
nt|mikael_w: For you that havent seen Peter Fredin played before can I only say, Buckle up and sit still, He is well known for his odd way to play|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT was good/bad, showing a light club raise i guess?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Lots of random swedish here this week|pg||
nt|athene: assuming west bids 3@H, east is still a bit stuck|pg||
nt|mikael_w: These days its comon to put the pressure on the opps, But this is even to much for me :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Swedes are bidding as if they owned the place|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Ah, East has West in on his secret|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: west knows now that all his cards are working|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Now if West happens to show his two aces, despite his mediocre hand ...|pg||
mb|4S!|an|Q|nt|brolucius: South will not believe that his adventurous gambit has succeeded.|pg||
nt|athene: so even with a minimum in hcp he can show some enthusiasm|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|an|RKC|nt|bjacobs: This hand mirrors the one before ... cueing in the suit you have shown.  But here, E/W have clearly established their fit first|pg||
nt|athene: the very light overcall might well backfire|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Left to their own devices, the Swedes had no slam ambitions in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S!|an|2 KC + !DQ|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Finally a good board for France|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The @S10 makes this an acceptable slam - just|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: wow, maybe they'll get to 7|pg||
nt|athene: West has grand ambitions!|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he puts his partner with a fifth diamond|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think West is just being a good partner.  He's informing East that all the keys are there|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, as I see it 6 @d is unbeatleble|pg||
nt|athene: if east had @SAKQ10x @DAQxxx then 7@D would be ok|pg||
mb|7D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: He is surely showing more than a mere 12 count balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikael_w: But 7 is a more sensitive contract for sure :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is just about the end of the match|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think you can just "be a good partner" once you have bid blackwood - you have to have grand slam interest|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did I say finally a good board for France?|pg||
nt|athene: once west bids blackwood, he should be taking control|pg||
pc|d8|nt|brolucius: We can expect E/W to find 4@S at the other table, so that will be a jump start for the Swedish team.|pg||
nt|warrens:  declarer has to decide to play for Qx of @D or Q10 onside.  I expect him to play for the drop.|pg||
nt|athene: These days it's quite a common gambit to jump to 4@H with huge defence to spades, hoping to push opps into 4@S - perhaps EW were scared of that.  If either one had had a bit more ...|pg||
nt|athene: he would have acted over 4@H, surely.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6@D is only fair, because if South had @SJxxx (or North), then it doesn't have much of a play|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|bjacobs: 7@D needs a different adjective to describe it|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|brolucius: Auction was the same at the other table!|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Specs wondering why Nyström does not have the  ö  instead of o. Logical explanation: they don't have the  ö  on American keyboards|pg||
nt|athene: his suits are a little threadbare but still, i would have thought that bidding was the normal action|pg||
nt|paulhac:  4-4-4-1 singleton club|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if 4@D promised a fifth diamond, then it was east's fault, but if it didn't, what did he do that was wrong?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nothing, apart from that teensy weensy 7@D bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fredin does not miss any games vulnerable and not this one either|pg||
mb|4H|nt|warrens:  I believe this shows a singleton club or diamond|pg||
nt|diaoff: or single @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Many players bid the singleton but as it is often doubled for the lead some have reverted to the suit above|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: The French style used to be fairly sedate, as opposed to the Northern European teams who like to bid a lot more, but I don't know if that is really still true these days.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: There you go|pg||

nt|mikael_w: I can tell you all a little story about Peter Fredin|pg||

nt|athene: delcarer really wants to play on clubs here and hope to reach his hand with the @DK|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which is standard in Sweden, and so is 3/5 leads|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|brolucius: Responder uses transfer responses after interference and the double is part of that scheme.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I really can't understand why you would bid with the East cards. 4333 and not a single intermediate. You are a big favourite to go down in anything higher than 1NT|pg||

nt|paulhac:  Is this a book hand David?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer cannot pick up K-10-x-x with East, so a finesse of the jack cannot make the contract.|pg||

nt|athene: but it's not that hard now he has two fast heart tricks |pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's certainly an awkward one|pg||

nt|athene: getting to dummy|pg||

nt|lml: he knows partner has 3@S and 6@D or so|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think 3NT is in trouble on a heart lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I'm sure all rebids are transfers, that's one of the advantages of playing that 1@d is always unbalanced, you don't need the 1NT rebid as natural|pg||

nt|athene: 3NT is a nice contract|pg||
nt|athene: well done to get there in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D can go down, but it's all double dummy|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think the distinction is where you have a legitimate claim.  At trick 12, declarer leads to the KJ - you are sitting over it with the AQ ... ok, you can whisper away|pg||
mb|3C|an|Q|mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Maybe it can't, on second thoughts|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if you really want to just speed up play, don't whisper to declarer, show him your hand, seems the obvious thing|pg||

nt|Walddk2: How good a save is 4@S over 3NT?|pg||

mb|p|nt|mikael_w: extreamly well done to find 3 NT in other room I think|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Fallenius just torn between 3NT and 5@D I think|pg||
nt|ritong: fallenius is certainly weighting the merits of 5@d vs 3 NT|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, Maybe Fallenius will bid it now, but ONLY becuse of the Vuln I think|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: France in 4@S at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: These players usually judge very well|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In 5@D it seems you have to safely negotiate a heart ruff|pg||
nt|ritong: he knew the @ss 4/4, but presumed that, for his 3@s bid, west might well hold 5@cs|pg||
nt|mikael_w: He might even have think about 6 @d now as a spec told me|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Back to that 3@C opening in 3rd on 25. Dubinin at the last table also opened 3@C and was left to play there|pg||

nt|Walddk2: East passed!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South opened 1@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West overcalled 1@H, then 1@S by North|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East's rebid was 6@H!|pg||
nt|diaoff: Never argue with success :)|pg||
nt|athene: Yes that all seems reasonable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think I would pass the East hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: You would open 1@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, 1@D|pg||
nt|athene: I really don't know what the winning action is with that East hand - even a computer simulation isn't going to give you the "truth" because so much depends on how everyone is going ...|pg||
nt|athene: to bid later on|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Seems wrong to pass a 5-loser hand with two aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: back|pg||
nt|brolucius: I think I would pass and hope to describe it well later.|pg||
mb|1C|an|2+|nt|diaoff: I like the pass, it's often efficient just listen one round with such settings...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Strul still 50 up against Lynch|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here we have another slam|pg||
mb|1S!|an|relay|nt|ritong: question is: which size|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7@D is pretty good, isn't it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: roughly @ds 3/2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: what about clubs?|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|Walddk2: This start will make you bid it with some science|pg||
nt|athene: I remember someone saying with a singleton and a void you should splinter in your singleton and then cue your void, or something|pg||
nt|Walddk2: de Knijff's 6@H was a punt, a successful one admittedly|pg||
nt|athene: He might have been drunk at the time, of course|pg||
nt|brolucius: He maybe wanted it to sound like a punt to deter a sacrifice. |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: How do you show two splinters? :)|pg||
nt|ritong: that is the rough part:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Diamonds 3-2 and clubs 4-1 would still be awkward|pg||
mb|2D!|an|relay|nt|Walddk2: Why did no-one invent that|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@C splinter. Give Bill a brownie point.|pg||
nt|athene: Well West is going to force to slam now surely|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think they will bid 7@D|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|Walddk2: 7@H might make, but unlikely that they will bid it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not a usage of 4NT that will receive the Nobel Prize for Blackwood.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Zaleski thinking about how to show two keycards ands a void presumably|pg||
nt|athene: Now east is worried, because if he shows two keycards and a void, his partner will think he has a spade void :)|pg||
nt|athene: club void sorry|pg||
nt|warrens:  i'm betting on 5@s, 2 + the Queen|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yep, I think to feel fine you need both minors beak|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: West will be surprised to hear that his partner holds only 8 points.|pg||
nt|warrens:  wrong again|pg||
nt|athene: i thought the standard way to bid these was 5NT = 2 keycards and void somewhere|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Commentators always lose their bets, Warren|pg||
mb|2N!|an|relay|nt|Walddk2: Predicting is dangerous|pg||
nt|athene: 5NT even   keycards that is|pg||
nt|athene: with an odd number of keycards you can cue 6 of the void or bid 6trump suit if the void is higher|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is not for West to gamble on which void partner has.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must be clubs, right?|pg||
nt|athene: so if east had bid 6@H, that would have shown odd keycards and higher-ranking void (hence must be spade)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The odds lie steeply in that direction, it is true.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can't make partner believe that you have a singleton in the splintered suit and a void elsewhere|pg||
nt|brolucius: No.|pg||
nt|brolucius: But West can hardly count 13 tricks even so.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 6@C now as a general grand slam try|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easy for us to find that bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and for Pilon|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|brolucius: Blackwood auctions where BOTH players have a void are particularly awkward. Better to avoid them. |pg||
nt|athene: Perhaps at this point south begins to wish he had doubled 4@C :) maybe that would have other meanings for them, though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This hand alone is worth all the money we paid to watch this match|pg||
nt|brolucius: French kibitzers will not agree, if they reach 7@H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Well ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How obvious is it for North to lead a club?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would say close to zero|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: slow connection|pg||
nt|ritong: fallenius will certainly know almost everything about his part s hand, except the minor jacks|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|brolucius: Sighs of relief all round.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: either minor-suit jack in north's hand makes the grand slam a lot better of course :)|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: We shall never know what the lead would have been against 7|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't think I would have doubled 4@C on the South cards. That can sometimes help their auction.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: lots of alerts, no questions or answers|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nyström-Bertheau (sitting out in this set) are able to spot jacks with their  zzz  relays|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|brolucius: In any case North might assume that East's void was in clubs too.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: All the sutton there is a relä-system going on :) We have not seen a single bidding like this before from Fredin-Fallenius|pg||
nt|athene: are they so-called because of the behaviour they induce in opps during the auction?|pg||
mb|5C!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I actually don't know why they are called  zzz   A = 3  K = 2  Q = 1   z's|pg||
nt|athene: oh right i know them as "zeeps"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: are they any good?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Fallenius now trying to put auction together|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like it|pg||
nt|athene: having reached the 5-level, south starts thinking in earnest about what suit should be trumps :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well the Jacks Union don't like them.  And it's the lack of minor suit jacks that make this a bad grand|pg||
mb|7D|nt|ritong: oole|pg||
nt|po-s: might East lead a diamond against  club slam?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They had 12 rounds of bidding against me a few years ago, landed in 6NT and told us before the lead: "All you have is @HA"|pg||
nt|athene: well the two 7@D contracts cancel out i suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: So they claimed before the lead|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, If Fallenius in any way invite Fredin to Grand, Fredin will offcurse say NO, after showing all the honors|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps south has bid this on the basis that if partner has @DJ or @CJ, grand is good, and even if he hasn't, it's not so bad|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ritong: very well done anyway|pg||
nt|athene: now will he wonder why he didn't get a trump lead/|pg||
nt|ritong: disappointing dummy, will improve soon|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This hand is perhaps too hard.  We've noted the lack of minor suit jacks, but if there were some minor suit TENS, 7@D would become acceptable again|pg||
nt|ritong: really sorry, did not notice trump break, was not sneering|pg||
nt|mikael_w: lol. If SOMEONE can make this its Fredin for sure|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Tough job with such a slow connection, John. You are doing very well!|pg||

pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: Peter Bertheau who is in the audience tells me: "When the system was first invented, Daniel Auby didn't know what to call the 3-2-1-point scale, so he marked them with "ZZ" for the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: time being. Thus it remained."|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: he doesn't have to go doubling things and getting all excited|pg||

nt|athene: To be fair, South's hand is worth a LOT more facing 5+ spades, which perhaps he was expecting on the closed room auction|pg||
nt|brolucius: But it was North who jumped to 4@S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Surely not a free bid from North now.|pg||

nt|athene: but the defence have to attack spades at some point before one goes on a club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes it was Ebenius, confirmed by Fredrik Nyström|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H looks strange unless 3@H promised a fit|pg||
nt|athene: in which case is that because NS play 3@D there as GF|pg||
nt|athene: or was 2@D itself GF?|pg||
nt|po-s: remarkable - West must cover the diamond seven to legitimately beat  the contract. South needs to ruff a spade so the D6 will produce a trick eventually I think|pg||
pc|hT|nt|brolucius: North had every chance to pass 2@D when his partner showed a hand that was perhaps only 4-3 in the majors. |pg||

nt|athene: i'm told 3@D there was forcing to game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: balanced being 6322|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: since with a very poor hand and a long major, south could bid it directly in response to 2@C|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|brolucius: Leave out the word 'slight' and I will agree with you.|pg||
nt|athene: you would never call anything "a overbid" David|pg||
nt|brolucius: His partner could re-open with a double if 2@D ran to him and North could bid 2@S then.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|diaoff: Normally 5+ @D if 4-3 though, so there were some extra info|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|diaoff: Anyway, an overbid in my opinion|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Swedish NPC, Jan Kamras, says it shows 4-4|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see, but he was not in the 4th seat, so I don't agree with 2@S at all. (I do realise that he is 10 times a better player than me but...)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: but also, as Dan said, can be 4-3 with five diamonds on the side|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So they are both right|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Bertheau long pause|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 33 minutes left in quarter|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: play speedy until last 2 boards|pg||
nt|brolucius: No need to use up every minute, though. Perhaps you can point that out to them.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are on board 11 in the closed room of our other match|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fleisher up by 41 against Diamond|pg||
nt|paulhac:  What is the longest time omeone has taken to play a board?|pg||
nt|brolucius: On Board 11 where I noted the lack of a negative double from Nystrom on his 10-count (he passed you will recall), South did make a negative double at the other table and they are ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: now in 2@S on a 7-card fit.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 28 minutes, Barnet Shenkin in a Scottish cup tie|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Barnet Shenkin took 33 minutes once|pg||
nt|jtr: You took 3 minutes once Paul|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Barnet says 28|pg||
nt|brolucius: Any advance on 33?|pg||
nt|jtr: But it was a 5NT contract|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I was in the other room Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ahh|pg||
nt|brolucius: Did he make it?|pg||
nt|jtr: 3 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, he played from the wrong hand eventually!|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Yes we were both in the same contract|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|brolucius: I wonder what the longest pause has been before someone said 'Oh, sorry, is it my bid?'|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sadly, both Ebenius and Auby are no longer with us|pg||
pc|d9|nt|warrens:  I was playing against a British declarer in the semifinals of the Transnationals.  He was playing a double contract that if made we would lose the match.  He took so long they penalized him 15 IMPs and he went down anyway, so we won by over 30.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s5|nt|po-s: I was corrected - a heart ruff is good enough|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brolucius: Andrew Robson.|pg||
nt|warrens:  Might have beaten Barnet's record.|pg||
nt|warrens:  No names|pg||
nt|athene: Something like that happened to Andrew Robson in the world individual a few years back - he was overtaken by something ridiculous like 0.1% by Bocchi because of some time penalty|pg||
nt|brolucius: It made the front page of the Times.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Margaret Thatcher I think|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: She was also pretty slow|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bjacobs: This time, Mikael, you have Fredin at the helm.  And it appears he does need to guess the clubs|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, although as the play has gone, he is trying for an endplay|pg||
nt|athene: he is going for @SA, spade and hope that east wins it?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: Break for dinner after this set (board 32). Restart at 8 pm local time, 11 pm New York, 4.00 Paris, 3:00 am London, 2:00 pm Sydney, in about 2 hours and 10 minutes|pg||

nt|bjacobs: He'd made up his mind earlier, of course, but I wonder what the reasoning was|pg||
mb|1C!|an|2+|nt|Walddk2: Two strnage auctions I think it's fair to say, so a flat board probably justified|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he decided that with @SKJ, @DK, @CA east would have opened?|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  this is a great result for the Swedes.  |pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
mb|1S|an|GF relay|nt|warrens:  Unlikely to be repeated.|pg||
nt|athene: 6nt isn't so great on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|athene: you need the heart finesse and the spades to come in|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|athene: 6@C is better as you just need the spades to come in for a diamond pitch|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: then you can concede a heart|pg||
nt|athene: he pretty much knows the spade situation, or can guess it|pg||
nt|po-s: don´t quite see why he guessed right. East I assume, is more likely to lead from his queen than the ace|pg||
mb|2C!|an|relay|nt|Walddk2: Pilon is not going to accept a 4NT invite|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what else can Zaleski bid?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, offcurse he had already decide, But he played verry fast, becuse if E take the A sometimes he might get it all wrong and return a @s maybe :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulhac:  He might just bid 6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I would say so.  East encouraged spades, and he won't have @SQJ10x|pg||
nt|mikael_w: not a big chanse, but still an extra chanse |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|athene: East really has pretty good cards but it's that five-card club suit with the @C109 which make the slam good|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Maybe 2@D artificial to find out about five clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In fact, he won't have @SJ10x (would lead it), so indeed Fredin knew the hand|pg||
mb|2H!|an|relay|nt|brolucius: North might lead a diamond against 3NT but it would be rather risky against 6NT on two balanced hands.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|ritong: they will probably land in 4@h, and zaleski has an interesting trump stack  let s see if he leads his long side suit|pg||
nt|ritong: in an attempt to shorten long trump hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Peter pointing at bidding box repeatedly to decipher auction, memory strain|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Bjorn did same thing on 7@D hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's Fallenius's system from when he played with Welland I think|pg||
nt|po-s: I wonder if 2D promised club stopper - not alerted it seems|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Someone in the audience will no doubt correct me if I am wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Welland kibitzing now|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, then Welland can tell us maybe ? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: I am pretty sure he is confused right now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: still trying to put things together|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Welland on opposite side of table from Peter|pg||
nt|po-s: precisely my thought|pg||
nt|mikael_w: But IF they shod get it all wrong and end up in 4 @s, my guess is that makes to|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: maybe telepathy in order|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 6 minutes on the clock|pg||
nt|Walddk2: + 10 minutes grace time, right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: y|pg||
nt|po-s: to me it sounds like a doubleton spade honour, |pg||
nt|mikael_w: grace time ? what is that|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: only 1 table of 4 in this room done now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 10 minutes at end of round|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: for completion|pg||
nt|mikael_w: then why is it not simply 16 min left on clock ?|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Because you only get the10 minutes once?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: they put 75 minutes on clock for each 8 boards|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D is puppet to 4@H, to sign off?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: this is hard for the defence because they know nothing about north's hand|pg||
nt|po-s: no, I think it means Partner I don´t know what we are doing|pg||
nt|athene: other than that he wants to play in 4@H facing what south has :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But North knows about East's hand, via the double|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzfd: Peter asked did I get it right?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What was the point of that double, by the way?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: I wonder if any pair found 6@C? if so, well done|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: well i suppose East sort of wants his partner to lead a club against notrumps|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||

nt|warrens:  nice play of J@D at trick one.  if it loses, declarer would certainly finesse if partner led another @D and that way the suit won't block if partner led from 8xxxx|pg||

nt|Walddk2: We won't be able to start until all of the tables have compared because they are all playing the same boards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And they are VERY slow in the closed room of our other match|pg||

nt|bjacobs: But yes, one can certainly sympathize with West|pg||
nt|mikael_w: And thanks John for an exelent job|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then 4@S must show the king, no?|pg||
nt|po-s: his first double probably showed the ace - French way|pg||
nt|bjacobs: oh, ok, I didn't follow the methods properly|pg||
