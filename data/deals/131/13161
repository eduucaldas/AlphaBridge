pc|h3|nt|szalay: ok, u can try 6@D, but its terrible...long run I dont suggest slams with 30 hcp and 2 balanced hands|pg||
nt|szalay: bid your games, take your tricks (by Hamman) is good advice in any level|pg||
nt|sybarra: I take it this is the "slam try" sequence |pg||
nt|szalay: with aceless 11, with Qx @C I wd just say 3N, confess|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|2D|nt|daman: East might get firsky and bid 2@D|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: would you make a penalty dbl with the north hand ?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|daman: oh no|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|szalay: if u go to normal games: go as fast as u can...dont give them chance to interfere|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably a preemptive @D raise coming |pg||
nt|szalay: why not 4@H with passed pd?|pg||
nt|frankaus: Ax no the best stopper in the world often better played from Qx side|pg||
nt|szalay: slam is unlikely, @H are good, so?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but unlikely to keep e/w out of 4 @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: you had the one with the picture |pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: the website|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: looks like a 30 point deck to E |pg||

mb|p|nt|szalay: e-w gave them all the chance|pg||
nt|xenya: they might get to a hopeless slam now -- and they did|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S?  rkk ? |pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: I think first step to trap was 1@H...after that they came deeper and deeper|pg||

nt|ady: defence should prevail |pg||
pc|s3|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ady: spade lay out bad for declarer|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rnmalik: the bidding sequence enabled EW to find the defence to 2@H|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|h9|pg||
nt|ady: cant see any other bidding possible|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am not so sure why N bid over 2 @C |pg||

mb|2H!|an|weak majors|mb|p|nt|xenya: but E did bid 5@C -- seems that's what W was eager to hear|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: South could have 18+ balanced or any 5-4, passing would be a gamble|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|szalay: I think a tipical mistake to correct in junior age by coach(es): stop slam-greedy|pg||

pc|sT|nt|frankaus: put me down as a pass with Wests hand - aceless 4333 even with 14 i would pass|pg||

nt|sybarra: Special thanks to Kees Tammens and Hans van Staveren, and sponsors Max Abram, Herman Drenkelford, Peter Sisselaar and Jos Janssens.|pg||
nt|szalay: it looks an interesting 3N|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!|pg||
nt|szalay: does West have way to show @D lead?|pg||
nt|szalay: or may be HIS lead, even better:)|pg||
nt|ady: if west is on lead to 3NT  may choose a heart when east has shown majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are back in about 1/2 hour |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes play went very fast here so that is why|pg||
nt|szalay: fast play seldom means good|pg||
nt|frankaus: fine operating Jacco <clap> <clap> <clap> <clap>|pg||
nt|szalay: I think South has INV with @Cs, lets say 3@C is normal or 2N...|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|vugraphzeg: it was west thinking but i try to do 2 bids at a time|pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks like it should make |pg||
nt|szalay: r u sure?|pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder|pg||
nt|szalay: 1@S, 1@H and how many @Cs?|pg||
nt|ady: looks like west has mis understood partners bid|pg||
nt|szalay: its Molenaar's double session|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: west might have explained this as weak with @d|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|szalay: I think its going down for @S lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes!!  here we go again|pg||
nt|szalay: 6@C for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: East wasnt passing, I could tell you that|pg||
nt|xenya: E seems to have taken partner's 4@C too seriously|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|szalay: if u travel across the World, better to agree 2suiter overcalls|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: the problem was the semi natural 1@c openingbid i think|pg||
nt|szalay: if a bid (semi)natural, better to treat it as natural, eg. to play (1m)-2m as Michaels vs. prepared 1m yet|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to misguess hts here also |pg||
pc|c9|nt|szalay: but grand slam try with missing ace was a mistake, anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 1430, I guess|pg||
nt|xenya: admittedly, he does have a great hand|pg||
nt|szalay: nbo pressure for N-S now|pg||
nt|szalay: the real issue is 3m is nat or stopper asking|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|szalay: time for @S switch yet, and likely 2 off|pg||
nt|szalay: c u in 30 minutes|pg||
nt|szalay: byebye|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c8|nt|xenya: this stands no chance of course -- let's see if he can get out for -1|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|frankaus: bed time here back latter in day european time|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes this happened, north couldnt play south for 4@D|pg||
nt|xenya: i doubt that -- W's clubs are too small|pg||
nt|xenya: setting up @Ds would mean seetting up trump tricks for N|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu frank @H |pg||
nt|xenya: but i overlooked the fact that the defence had presented E with a trick -- now he certainly can make 11 and must be thinking how to get 12  |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: can establish spades    but has no trump control|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|ady: world team made 600 in OR   so anything under down 4 is a plus|pg||
nt|szalay: 2 or 3 down is the question now|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|d3|nt|xenya: it looks so close... -- but can't be managed i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: very close,  pity for E the clubs do not break |pg||
nt|szalay: 3 off: -5 imp|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|szalay: 2 off: +3|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  has to be less than 3 down |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Lets say J@S and @DA and another @D would reduce losses somewhat|pg||
nt|szalay: if he leads @H to king: -5|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|VugraphPl1: 100%|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: or spades 4/3 |pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|szalay: well played|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h9|pc|c2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|szalay: East knows counts, I think|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: can duck it all around?|pg||
nt|szalay: and South knows place of @H A|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 10 of @C in dummy |pg||
nt|sybarra: most unfortuanlte |pg||
nt|sybarra: *unfortunate |pg||
nt|sybarra: see you now in about 15 min |pg||
nt|xenya: 2 down means only 3 imps to Poland|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone |pg||
nt|xenya: bye for now|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx all cu shortly |pg||
mc|8|nt|szalay: well deserved 3 imps|pg||
