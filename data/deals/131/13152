nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|peacokk: good morning|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: hi all |pg||
nt|jallerton: Hello everybody|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: hi all and welcome|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: sorry about the delay|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: 1nt=12-14|pg||
nt|jallerton: a nice close match|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 1@d shows a natural 1@d opening - BUT it is not a balanced hand|pg||
mb|3H|nt|xenya: that was quick|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: hi all... and wlc back |pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody!|pg||
nt|xenya: hi Ed|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: last 16 boards for a place in the final tomorrow|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks precipitous to pass 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: no problem Jan, you are surely NOT to blame:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: if they need someone to blame then I am ready to be the one -- used to it -- my wife do it all the time|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2nt = 18-19 semibalanced or marmic 4-1-4-4|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4D!|nt|vugraphzey: 2@c = GF|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@D = @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@c=strong natural @s+@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@h = natural|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@c is optimistic but is makeable|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@s is 4.th suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: Both 3NT and 5@c are sensible contracts.  6@c is indeed optimistic|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|ralfwil: But they are there:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|jallerton: and 6@c is worse played by South|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: agree. Both jaws is on N|pg||
nt|jallerton: A spade lead looks most likely|pg||
nt|jallerton: forcing declarer to finesse at trick 1|pg||
nt|xenya: best lead -- unbid suit, that simple|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards for all participants are online|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2010/OpenWom/systems.html|pg||
mb|5H|nt|xenya: and an equally quick 2 down i suppose|pg||
nt|ralfwil: too bad communications to aviod tge @s finess|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: EW leads are 1-3-5 against trumph and 2.4. against nt|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the @s finess|pg||
nt|jallerton: It's a shame Roland isn't playing in the Danish Teams.  I'm sure he'd be in this one!|pg||
nt|xenya: presents declarer with a club trick but gains a vital tempo|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Ouch, 3nt by s is a lot easier.|pg||
nt|jbgood: and game in @h - one of the denominations available to get the gaqme bonus|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! a typical Roland:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: game, actually..|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   lets you watch any/all of the 4 vugraph tables from Australia or the 2 tables of Vanderbilt Final from Reno|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jbgood: may ber duplicated at the other table, depends on the NT range|pg||
pc|sK|nt|santyclz: Easy now.  No longer any possibility of losing 3@hs and a @d.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|jallerton: now it all bolis down to how declarer pays the @c suit|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: remains to unblock now|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Blakset has the @c K in hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jallerton: *boils|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
nt|jbgood: tu Jan |pg||
nt|jallerton: now obvious reason to go against the a priori odds|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|s9|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: the "team" scores don't really mean much -- this Team Trials is run as a PAIR event|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s6|pc|d2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d5|pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: but this way we have one other table to compare actions/results|pg||

qx|c2|st||md|4SAQJT87HA4DAK9CA3,S6543HK95DT62CJ96,S2HQJT763DQ875CK2,SK9H82DJ43CQT8754|sv|n|nt|santyclz: Well, even I would have a good chance of making 6@ds on this hand, let's see if it's biddable.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 12 of the 14 imps difference was the starting point - as a carry over from a previous encounter|pg||
nt|xenya: well done by NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: ready for actionboard :)|pg||
nt|othered1: This may be fun, depending upon who gets hung first by the misfit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both of these pairs use multi-purpose opening 2-bids -- most everything else is natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lilley-Nagy strong NT  Delivera-Robinson ACOL with Weak NT|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|peacokk: EW better stay low on this one|pg||
nt|jbgood: the Blakset lead is a carry over from previous encounter|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: NS playing 5card major and 15-17nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: EW plays 5-card major and 14+-17 nt|pg||
nt|jbgood: if N can get to know that Auken has a 5 card @d suit - difficult if Fredin jumps in|pg||
nt|xenya: we are in for a bit of fun here i think |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: 3@h = 10-12 and 3@s|pg||
nt|jallerton: EW play strong NT, NS play weak NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d = 5+@c and eighter invitational to game or invitational to slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2nt = minors|pg||
nt|othered1: may turn out to be a test of NS's countermethods to unusual NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I guess NS plays 3@c from North = I have my own suit and I want to bid at least game|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@s = I have my @s-suit|pg||
nt|othered1: Most pairs play something along the lines of "unusual/unusual" where minor suit bids distinguish hands with major suit lengths.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|xenya: indeed -- what should N do now -- would 3@H be forcing -- or should he double or cuebid first|pg||
nt|xenya: so cuebid it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@h directly after 2nt is not forcing -- but 3@c is forcing with own suit - 3@d would have been forcing with @s support|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: maybe 2@h shows a weak NT type hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: sr I cant explain 2@h and 2@s ... South has not asked W yet :(|pg||
nt|jallerton: http://www2.bridge.dk/Systemkort.aspx?ID=375 for convention cards|pg||
nt|xenya: that didn't get them too far, did it|pg||
nt|othered1: if that's a cue-bid, not simply showing @H with game values (my method)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = FG, 25+BAL or weak 2@H/@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: the double by N paid off|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: hmmm in that context, seems 2@S should be weak 2@S opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: 4nt = 1430 |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 5@c = one ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@h shows only 3-card @c ... and a weak nt-hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: I was close!|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: yes ... you are good :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, makes sense -- 3@C shows @Hs, 3@D would show a spade fit|pg||
nt|othered1: On the auction, 4@H is high enough.  With quiet EW's might get quite a bit higher|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: yes and 3@h natural nonforcing and 3@s natural support nonforcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not easy to see how many tricks declarer can take|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: looks like Nagy is using the same Convention Card that I am :)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|vugraphzey: NS leads 1.3.5.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jbgood: was 4@c just a game force?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 4@c is explained as 2-suiter and GF |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jbgood: a likely 2 down..|pg||
nt|jbgood: the double by N was really a tough bid|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jallerton: maybe direct 3@c over 2@h would have been stronger and he has to go via 2@s to sign off|pg||
pc|s9|nt|santyclz: Alerted so might be more.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Jan.|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Peter Fredin is now calling the TD about th first board ... and the TD has arrived now |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Peter Fredin is explaining to the TD |pg||
nt|jbgood: wrong explanations?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|h3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|xenya: not that the contract is in any danger but still|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Pip, our vugraph operator gives this table talk    Lilley: sorry pd|pg||
mc|13|pg||
qx|c3|st||md|1SJ85HJ87DKQCKJ983,S643HA32DT98762C6,SAKQTHT9D543CQ542,S972HKQ654DAJCAT7|sv|e|nt|peacokk: Could have been worse also|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I dont really know ... and now Peter Fredin has just told the TD that there was no problem ... ??|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: ready for the next one -- hopefully we'll not be disconnected anymore :)|pg||
nt|xenya: we need a new board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we have a very small group in this room -- holler if there's anything special you want me to rant about|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|othered1: Steve Robinson -- "always open a 5-card major" -- wouuld approve of south's action.   But most players would open this hand 1@H, if they open at all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S normally 5+ --- but this is great lead director in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|vugraphzey: 2@h= 12-15hcp and natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: if they open with a natural 1-bid, that is.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: trump lead should be on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I guess @c K|pg||
nt|ahollan1: CC doesn't describe the passed hand 2N -- but sure looks like they are NOT playing Drury|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzey: I got it|pg||
nt|jallerton: did you have inside information, Jan?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzey: me ... nooo|pg||
nt|othered1: can I assume double was penalty-oriented?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|santyclz: The controversial 3-card raise.  I like it.|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jbgood: the low club lead may induce N to continue the suit.. |pg||
nt|peacokk: Will Konow be able to read @C3?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: W said: "Make some room for these" when he put down the @ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: dbl = penalty|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: but South is a chicken and pull to 3@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW standard signals|pg||
nt|ahollan1: concensus is 2N=max with 3@S    that's the bid that Drury handles with 2@C|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|othered1: Trump split doesn't help this, but favorable @H position may be useful.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jbgood: some like it, I prefer 4 card raise unless no other bid..|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, all|pg||
nt|xenya: hello again|pg||
nt|othered1: @S position isn't necessarily clear to east.  Couldn't south be 2=5=1=5?|pg||
nt|othered1: Of coiurse, east is thinking about lots more than the play to this trick.|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I have been told that the open room "crashed" -- but now we are back - but this board has been played - and South won 8 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jbgood: many lead the second best from a bad suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: NS leads are 2.4.|pg||
nt|jbgood: second from top i mean|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: but later in the "game" they play 2.4. with attitude -- so then they play 2. from 4 bad ones|pg||
nt|othered1: Certainly a possible result|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|santyclz: Although this may not be the poster-child hand for it.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|jbgood: he may just make it|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hK|nt|peacokk: Well done|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Pip says  @S raise but happy to play NT|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
nt|jbgood: if he throws a heart, and cash a di and clubs to get his spade jack en passant|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: sr about the speed -- but this time I am not to blame for sure|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|nt|jbgood: the ten may have been better, but a spade switch was imperative|pg||
nt|jbgood: needs the clubs to be 3-3 - he will make now|pg||

nt|peacokk: np|pg||
nt|jallerton: an overtrick imp for N/S probably|pg||
nt|Walddk11: They placed the tray on the wire and off we were|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ralfwil: 3NT on E looks good|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: in ACO, 2@H is just 1-round force|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: yes - 2 down means the ten - nice defense|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@s = 10-12 and 3@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: suspect we'll see 2@S-4@S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jallerton: West is worth a reverse|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk11: They should be spanked|pg||
mb|4D|nt|vugraphzey: here are the action again|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood:   1 was duplicated both biddingwise and resultwise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or .... delayed Splinter|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|xenya: NS will get the spanking instead i'm afraid|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: with such a sparce hand, i hadn't considered 4@D - especially if EW play that 2@S can be passed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: South may try the effect of @sJ or @SK here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Difficult lead for S|pg||
nt|jallerton: his heart pips do not make that suit attractive|pg||
nt|xenya: @HQ now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: @h Q is taken and put back again|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Jens is certainly thinking about @h Q|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ralfwil: You was right Jeffrey!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in OZ - do your ACOL players say 2/1 is forcing to a certain level, or can opener's rebid be passed?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nagy-Lilley using upside-down count & attitude|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|vugraphzey: south is thinking.....|pg||
nt|jbgood: he may go down now, but when the spade ten came to light I think he might just have played trumps|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|jbgood: losing 2 spades and a club|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 club ruffs available|pg||
nt|jbgood: but difficult for N to see?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Everybody agree with 4@h?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|peacokk: Yes, it was|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: imo -- the auction screamed for a trump lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play Weak NT throughout -- so that would NOT apply to 1@S-2x:2N |pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: W needs to learn more about the hand and the @HQ looks fairly safe at this point|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: will it be 1100|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Nagy probably thought that Robinson's 4@H was a working @H honor rather than shortness|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|xenya: W's heart discards suggested @S values|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|xenya: E's rather|pg||
nt|xenya: but E has to unblock now to avoid getting endplayed |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I am not absolutely sure if I made a mistake on the last @h play -- It might be that E played @h 8 instead of @h 5 ... sr all if that might be the case|pg||
nt|xenya: is that so obvious?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: speed up time @cJ :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: obviously Delivera was on same page as Robinson|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|s7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlike the previous 2 boards -- this hand is just a matter of overtricks|pg||

nt|xenya: considering that the auction may well be duplicated in the other room, this might not be all that bad |pg||
nt|ahollan1: this could be fun|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jallerton: If South responds 1@S that will slow West down|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jallerton: or 1@h transfer|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 1@h = transfer|pg||
nt|jallerton: 4+@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: ys|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: and might have longer @d suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: or longer @c suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: again 2@H is NOT automatic game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nagy has a few options  because of  a) strong 6@S  b) 3@H & void c) good 2nd suit|pg||
mb|5C|nt|tez: ok.do you want professional player?|pg||
nt|tez: sry|pg||
nt|othered1: Is it now normal to overcall 1N with iffy 15 counts?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well -- some of those options are gone now -- nice bid Ian|pg||
mb|p!|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|peacokk: S thinks he has a 15-17NT|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@h was brave|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@d = natural - normally longer @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: ns plays 1nt as 12-14 in first and second seat .... and 15-17 in third|pg||
nt|peacokk: oh, sorry|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like 3@h is the limit for EW|pg||
nt|jallerton: now West justified to jump to game|pg||
nt|xenya: i've seen people doing that over and over again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gosney only bid 4@C  and Hans-Nunn bid a grand .... but 7N down 1 won't score well at all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@C-6@D:6@H   just maybe |pg||
mb|6C|nt|othered1: I don't play hands well enough to be able to afford that|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: duplication is difficult when W opens 1nt in the other room (playing weak nt) :)|pg||
nt|xenya: however that was not to happen -- N doubled in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: remember this isn't really a team match --- the Australian Trials [aka Playoffs] is run as a PAIR event|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: you couldnt know :)|pg||
mb|6H|nt|vugraphzey: 2@c is forcing 2@d .. and now 2@h is invit with 5+@h|pg||
nt|xenya: instead of 1NT|pg||
nt|othered1: Isn't this now cold?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so -- we only know what ONE of the other pairs has done    there are actually 8 tables in play|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: South had to lead a @d to beat this I think|pg||
mb|p|pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: kudos to Robinson for the pressure bid of 5@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we can see 13 are available, but Lilley will take his time to find best line for TWELVE tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ralfwil: a @d lead had been better|pg||
pc|s3|nt|peacokk: Interesting lead|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|jallerton: (or let his partner lead a club out of turn)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: another solution:)|pg||

nt|vugraphzey: 1@s = at least a 5-card suit :)|pg||

nt|ralfwil: rather funny distributions - or? 7 or 8-cards suits en masse!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jallerton: even a club lead does not beat slam, as the hand with @sA does not have another club|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2nt = invitational + .. at least 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: but this time the brakes were too good:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 1@s is Walsh ... might have longer @d suit|pg||
nt|jbgood: easy to remember to alert when you actually have a longer @d suit - easy to forget if not:)|pg||
nt|othered1: Right, a lucky grand can generate action|pg||
nt|dburn: but this Danish version of the dealing program may be worth exporting - just been watching a bunch of part scores in the Camrose, so this is a change for the better|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|vugraphzey: Now W alerted 4@d --- South hasnt asked --- but at first W didnt alert now he has|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jbgood: 3 @d looks like a minisplinter - and now Søren has some extras for his bid..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I use 2nt different. 2nt is not only inviting , contains also some defensive values|pg||

nt|jbgood: Fredin keeps underleading red aces|pg||
nt|jallerton: South knows that someone is probably void in hearts, so sensibly tries the unbid suit|pg||

pc|sA|nt|dburn: probably, though, East will just try for a grand slam and then not bid one|pg||
