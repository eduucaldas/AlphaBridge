nt|daman: and we're off|pg||
nt|Gerben42: EW need no introduction - one of the most experienced US pairs |pg||
nt|daman: Levin-Weinstein tend to be very aggressive and play quickly|pg||
nt|Gerben42: especially successful in the Cavendish|pg||
nt|Gerben42: quickly is bad for the operator - good luck|pg||

nt|vugraphzff: we will be back soon|pg||
nt|daman: and we're off and pacing   as they say at the race track|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: a normal contract to start|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Which is that the Vanderbilt is essentially a stronger event than any of the world championships (except maybe the open Rosenblum Cup)|pg||
nt|gambit: I looked it up this morning, our finalists are from the original seeding  11 (Fleisher),12 (Strul), 15 (De Knijft) and 16 (Zimmerman)  great job to advance to the round of 4 |pg||
mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: both matches playing the same boards -- if you want to spy try http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   [one window per table]|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3N|nt|bjacobs: World Championships being restricted by country and/or zone|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Fleisher +65 vs Diamond and de Knijff +46 vs Zaleski. Lynch has withdrawn against Strul|pg||

nt|Gerben42: try to setup @D7?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @D is easiest for NS |pg||
nt|Gerben42: win @DQ and remove @C then back to @SJ|pg||
nt|daman: I see no viable alternative|pg||
nt|daman: do you think he might try for an endplay?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, something like that|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Fredin-Fallenius 1@D open = 4+ unbal  [or 3rd seat lead director]|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: This looks like a simple 4@S, with the trump lead holding down the overtricks|pg||

nt|ahollan1: other room Weinstein in East playing 1NX|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: does this qualify as automatic trump lead auction|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: On this auction, I think the trump is strongly suggested|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't ask Bill|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Trump is mandatory|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You have diamonds sitting over East ...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i was asking Bill|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|gambit: N sure to be endplayed (in NT) a couple times.....tough to get out of the way |pg||

nt|fabsayc: there is no night and day in Vegas|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: casinos open continuously|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree Bill. They could perhaps have started earlier than 1 pm (13.00)|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|d7|pg||

nt|xenya: it seems the defence has dropped a trick or two when E went up with the @DA -- admittedly, a duck is not easy|pg||

nt|xenya: NS are in 4H doubled in the CR...|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3@S blocking|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Maybe "I" should have opened 2@D (they play weak 2s in diamonds, i think)|pg||

nt|mrdct: no problems in 3NT here - but should north be getting involved in teh auction at these colours with 5-5 in the reds?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: lots of writing|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: maybe he wants to show short spades?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be 3@s giving shortness in @h to not give the possibility to dbl at opps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe they use steps for shortness|pg||
nt|mrdct: fredin having vague thoughts of a slam in @C?|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Except maybe this one|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: if West can't reopen impossible to have 12 tricks - right bid 3NT|pg||

nt|gambit: 10 toppers|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: As Pierre Schmidt points out, West will have to give the entry later anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: how did 4@S go down 2 in closed room|pg||

nt|gambit: Sometimes I think we fail to appreciate how well these players play, it is a treat to watch |pg||
nt|ady: also doubleton club|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bjacobs: So the idea behind Gazilli is that after 1major 1NT (and other auctions), 2@C is either clubs or a strong hand|pg||

mb|d|an|takeout|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|Gerben42: this will probably go down|pg||
nt|po-s: Fleisher may have tried to Blackwood - or he responded to what he thought was BW|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if you press GIB you will see making, but only the abbot will actually manage that|pg||
nt|daman: if he cashes 2@Ds and the @H Ace   I predict North will pick off the stiff @S King|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
nt|Gerben42: he wont cash @HA|pg||

nt|Gerben42: Steve fighting for every imp|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: took ruffing finese for @HJ down 1|pg||
nt|Gerben42: for example Levin could have @HQ|pg||
mc|9|nt|daman: see you all soon|pg||
nt|xenya: tanks everyone|pg||
nt|Gerben42: a prochaine|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks|pg||
nt|po-s: perhaps declarer should have won second spade min hand, ruffed a club and played a heart|pg||
nt|Gerben42: approx. 30 mins|pg||
nt|po-s: maybe he did|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 180 but not the way i predicted|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Still, Thomas is my favourite|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes for those that like fancy systems note that good old SEF does win a lot  sound bridge|pg||
nt|mikael_w: test|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: before we forget -- great job from our vugraph operator Debbie Hyatt !!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bjacobs: Final hand of the final set for the day.  A big well done to our fine operator John Schwartz.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: thx all|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And thanks to my fellow commentators, Martin, Roland and Henry, along with English language specialist David Burn|pg||
nt|mrdct: just need to drop the stiff @SK offside to make game here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|gambit: dble by E was silly, if undiscusssed as to length, as W 's bidding suggrdtd|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, this time e/w lost 2 IMP, next time they will push n/s to 3 @d and win 4 IMP|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bjacobs: Finally, our appreciation to the ACBL, in particular Jeff Johnston and Jan Martel for broadcasting this prestigious event. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: In just over 12 hours, the semi-finals commence|pg||
nt|hlortz: ah yes and the tireless Roland Wald who puts this show together|pg||
nt|bjacobs: tireless, and as far as I can tell, sleepless|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I may go for a kip now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need to find K sgl out |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 20 mins or so|pg||
nt|bjacobs: powernap|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So, Zimmermann vs Strul and de Knijff vs Fleisher in the semi-finals|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In exactly 12 hours from now|pg||
nt|ady: unless n/s can make 4@S  dropping sing King  looks like De Knijff will retain  a small lead|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: double here just keeps auction alive, i.e. takeout|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bjacobs: It's hard to commentate on this auction.  2@S ... was that a splinter?  Or some other form of raise?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: forcing raise i think|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: to game, with 2nt as the limit raise, but just a guess|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bjacobs: So, enough of science, wheel out Old Trusty|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mikael_w: I know 3 @d was home this time, But NEXT time its not that sure|pg||
nt|mrdct: if south was declarer and hadn't disclosed such @S length, you could work on the theory that if @SJ isn't covered the K is offside and then play for the drop - but with J109 in ...|pg||
nt|mrdct: dummy that theory wont work|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: best line on this lead, suggestions?|pg||
nt|po-s: finesse trumps...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart finesse, or heart ace and go for discards|pg||
nt|hlortz: on the bidding @D are 6-1 so no worries|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|bjacobs: Yes, and the @D3 confirms it|pg||
nt|hlortz: take the @H finesse|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So hook the heart without a care in the world|pg||
nt|po-s: still|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rabbi Rule rarely applied when appropriate|pg||
nt|gambit: TY to the players (fabulous bridge) the specs (wonderful silence), the VuG operator, (just plain great) and the commentators, hope you smiled, next session is (?) not ...|pg||
nt|gambit: sure....enjoyed, hope you all did too |pg||

nt|ahollan1: great set -- Debbie please thank the players for us|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: okay|pg||
nt|gambit: thx Al H, super job |pg||
nt|mrdct: the next set is fairly soon i believe - with the meal break between the 2nd and 3rd segments|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I have found out that next set prob will start in about 15 min|pg||
nt|gambit: not much of a break....|pg||
nt|gambit: cheers to all |pg||
nt|ahollan1: next set scheduled to begin in 20 minutes -- but teams can restart whenever they want|pg||
nt|bridge_one: THX ALL for Wothching|pg||
nt|mrdct: if these guys played anywhere remotely close to 7.5 minutes per board they would get ample time for breaks and get to bed before midnight|pg||
