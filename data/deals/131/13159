nt|benjent: Points points points|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Note that East passed an 11 count. very sensible :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|drorp:  yes both Israeli and Polish junior bridge are of the more solid styles|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now the 18+ 1@C again. 1@C is much more often 12-14 balanced|pg||
nt|benjent: Surely a psych :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|3C|nt|cuttysark: Good idea to have 2@C as a natural overcall of a Polish Club - whether this is worth it is moot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For those who did not stay up all night (Europe). Zimmermann (Multon, T. Bessis, M. Bessis, Helness, Helgemo) won the Vanderbilt, defeating Fleisher by 10 IMPs after a very close ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: contest|pg||
nt|benjent: I like North's action - always good to jack the level up over ambiguous openings|pg||
nt|sharkey: Can they get to 3 NT?|pg||
mb|d|nt|benjent: Sure - but from which side?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: NS quiet in CR|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzef: thomas bessis is coming to amsterdam to play in the juniortournament|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: They can make 6@d from West ... not so likely to get there, particularly now!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharkey: Double dummy Ben?|pg||
nt|benjent: Of course, best way :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The intervention certainly made it tough to reach 3NT by West. maybe he just had to cross his fingers and blast it|pg||
nt|benjent: Actually, they can make 6@d from East as well, but you really have to play double dummy|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think W shud bid 3 NT over 3@H - if E is 4-4 in M may bid 3@C over 2@C|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Just like 4@H - best line is DD|pg||
nt|benjent: 3NT over 3@h probably would have told the story ... very likely to be this sort of hand|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: It can, yes, but ...|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|benjent: I think if he sees the @s layout early enough, he may get out of the @h suit for 1 loser|pg||
nt|benjent: good start|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good shot to teat spades firts|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or even first|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h8|nt|benjent: to finesse hearts on the 2nd round, he needs South to have 5 more spaces than North|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: This is the end I'm afraid|pg||

nt|frankaus: the aust juniors have done well nearly winning our last two national events|pg||
nt|szalay: in Poland I think Polish Club is not a wild guess:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: yes ns polish club with 2@c weak majors|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N!|nt|szalay: ok, u can try 6@D, but its terrible...long run I dont suggest slams with 30 hcp and 2 balanced hands|pg||
nt|szalay: bid your games, take your tricks (by Hamman) is good advice in any level|pg||
nt|sybarra: I take it this is the "slam try" sequence |pg||
nt|szalay: with aceless 11, with Qx @C I wd just say 3N, confess|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I think east made a slamtry here, that is what i heard from the explanation from west|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: if it was slamtry, West wd accept for sure|pg||

nt|cuttysark: North might have switched to his singleton if he had one?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|benjent: Sure - but PO was wondering about cashing 2 diamonds|pg||
mb|1H|mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: Poland could easily pull the 11 IMPs back here|pg||
nt|benjent: Meanwhile, I'm convinced EW must have taken a bonus shower this morning. No one can really live this clean|pg||
nt|drorp:  still had to guess weather to pull 1 more diamond or 2|pg||
nt|po-s: D to dummy, spade to king, 2x H, 2x D then a spade |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Search me :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: think that wud work - S cud have countered by rising with @S A first time I think|pg||
nt|benjent: Don't we get to a position where South ruffs the 3rd round of spades and exits a club ... and waits for his @hJ?|pg||
nt|po-s: he didn´t|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|drorp:  wow 4@H|pg||
nt|benjent: It's the extra shape|pg||
nt|drorp:  that's some bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: And the controls :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not convinced by the club cue in the other room with the opening bid on his left - should really be the ace|pg||
nt|sharkey: West moved towards slam over 3@H CR|pg||
nt|drorp:  still, west passes, while in the other room west made a slam move opposite 3@H|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 4@H is not a very constructive raise - no cue|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|h8|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|szalay: if u go to normal games: go as fast as u can...dont give them chance to interfere|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably a preemptive @D raise coming |pg||
nt|szalay: why not 4@H with passed pd?|pg||
nt|frankaus: Ax no the best stopper in the world often better played from Qx side|pg||
nt|szalay: slam is unlikely, @H are good, so?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but unlikely to keep e/w out of 4 @H |pg||

nt|sybarra: 4 @S?  rkk ? |pg||
pc|d2|nt|szalay: I think first step to trap was 1@H...after that they came deeper and deeper|pg||

mb|p|nt|drorp:  another bad score for the Israelis EW in the closed|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@D rather ambitious|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D is crazy (to be diplomatic)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I expect their auction was systemic, and one of them forgot|pg||
mb|1C|mb|2C|nt|sharkey: if you're diplomatic Roland...:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|cuttysark: Presumably 3@D was invitational and West should have passed|pg||
nt|drorp:  it appears that they had a misunderstanding in the other room|pg||
nt|sharkey: What wud 2@D show from E?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Might be GF Checkback|pg||
mb|2S|nt|drorp:  west thought 3@D was 5-5 invititional so he "signed off" in 3@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: this hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: In which case 3@D would be to play|pg||
nt|po-s: I think Poles normally play it nonforcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sharkey: forcing?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|po-s: Years ago we played a Polish pair and bidding went 1S (2C) 2D. My partner asked and got the answer "unlimited" It turned out he meant downwards...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: A tad ambitious with so few aces and an iffy club stopper|pg||
nt|benjent: Aren't all non-game bids forcing? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: so E committed to game vs 12-14 NT looks like|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our next match, in about 55 minutes, will be World Team (Czech/Japan) vs Netherlands Red. Then after that, at 15.10 local time, USA vs Sweden|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well-earned 3 imp pickup for Israel|pg||
nt|drorp:  This should go 3 off|pg||
pc|s5|nt|benjent: Might get a chance at 1 off now|pg||

nt|szalay: to start @D ruff?|pg||
nt|frankaus: maybe planning on a dummy reversal|pg||

nt|cuttysark: No need to take risks!|pg||
nt|drorp:  another action hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: may end up in 2 NT?|pg||
nt|benjent: If spades are 4-1, it's actually even money who has the 3rd @c|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: 1@C in Polish is three-way. 1. 12-14 balanced - 2. 15+ with clubs - 3. 18+ any shape|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|benjent: Anyway, if West liked his hand last time, East absolutely loves this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: West not THAT excited....|pg||
mb|d|nt|cuttysark: Now any action shows the strong hand, is that right?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp:  2N now|pg||
nt|sharkey: or 2@C wud show @C hand?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think he has to double first with the 18+ hand|pg||
nt|drorp:  now he surely showed 18+ and clubs|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Romanski told me I could learn Polish Club in just 30 years....|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@C works very well on this layout|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C could be 15-17 with clubs I suppose|pg||
nt|benjent: West's hand is within a poofteenth of being good enough for game|pg||
nt|drorp:  i don't see west passes this, 5 card support...|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: kib says 2@C=15-18 with clubs X=any hand 18+|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Thank him for us - good to know|pg||
pc|sK|nt|benjent: North's doubleton @s will put paid to this|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Rather unlucky, I think|pg||
nt|drorp:  5@C is not a bad contract, just not working on this layout|pg||
nt|sharkey: repeating what Roland stated a few minutes ago: 1@C in Polish is three-way. 1. 12-14 balanced - 2. 15+ with clubs - 3. 18+ any shape|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|sT|nt|benjent: Single dummy, no auction, a reasonable alternative is to aim to ruff 3 @h's and 1 @s ... but that would be super crazy on the actual auction|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
mc|10|nt|drorp:  now we'll start the comparisons|pg||

nt|sybarra: Thanks also to my co commentators Szalay, Frank and Vladimir.     We appreciate your time, insights and humor.   |pg||

mb|p|mb|5C|nt|vugraphzeg: it was west thinking but i try to do 2 bids at a time|pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks like it should make |pg||
nt|szalay: r u sure?|pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder|pg||
nt|szalay: 1@S, 1@H and how many @Cs?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|nt|szalay: I think its going down for @S lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes!!  here we go again|pg||
nt|szalay: 6@C for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: East wasnt passing, I could tell you that|pg||
nt|xenya: E seems to have taken partner's 4@C too seriously|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|szalay: but grand slam try with missing ace was a mistake, anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 1430, I guess|pg||
nt|xenya: admittedly, he does have a great hand|pg||
nt|szalay: nbo pressure for N-S now|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|nt|szalay: time for @S switch yet, and likely 2 off|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: yes this happened, north couldnt play south for 4@D|pg||
nt|xenya: i doubt that -- W's clubs are too small|pg||
nt|xenya: setting up @Ds would mean seetting up trump tricks for N|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu frank @H |pg||
nt|xenya: but i overlooked the fact that the defence had presented E with a trick -- now he certainly can make 11 and must be thinking how to get 12  |pg||
