mb|p|mb|1C|an|*|nt|vugraphzef: coffee, good idea :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: the auction in the other room beggars belief|pg||

mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: I am back after swallowing 10 mg's of Valium|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb:  3N will make if East ducks a heart lead to the 9|pg||
nt|cuttysark: What is 1@C Roland?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: hmmm|pg||
mb|2C|nt|henryb:  tough play to find|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: I have no idea but I don't think they will end up in 3@D|pg||
nt|lml: looks like a strong club auction so far for east-west|pg||
mb|p!|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I feel 3NT coming on|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: needs to lead @H not @S to beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Won't happen|pg||
nt|lml: Frimer did show some values and a club suit after his negative|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can still be made on a heart lead - perhaps he has the evidence to duck|pg||
nt|henryb:  @h does not beat it: see above Liz. But East has to make a GREAT play|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ralfwil: now it´s easy!|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
nt|henryb:  on a spade it is trivial|pg||
nt|copeyj: declarer could duck @H as Henry says - after @H lead|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: No no|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think on the bidding East knows hearts are 5-2 and id South has not led an honour he does not have one....|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did not cash his second spade stopper, throwing a club winner from dummy to boot|pg||
nt|lml: it looks like there was some system confusion in the CR|pg||
nt|henryb:  surely East did not cash a second @s before playing @c??????????|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am sure he did not. But he did not show the operator his cards very well|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: My bad, sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: np|pg||
mc|9|nt|copeyj: im expecting an undo - tough for the operator sometimes when the cards go super fast without being able to see them properly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Practise makes perfect, don't worry|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: once they speed up, I always miss at least 1 card :(|pg||
nt|lml: its probably hardest with juniors and easiest with seniors|pg||
nt|lml: juniors play faster!|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: well EW can make 6@D|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|szalay: ok, u can try 6@D, but its terrible...long run I dont suggest slams with 30 hcp and 2 balanced hands|pg||
nt|szalay: bid your games, take your tricks (by Hamman) is good advice in any level|pg||
nt|sybarra: I take it this is the "slam try" sequence |pg||
nt|szalay: with aceless 11, with Qx @C I wd just say 3N, confess|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I think east made a slamtry here, that is what i heard from the explanation from west|pg||
nt|szalay: a bit starnge 3@C rebid except its forcing (doubt it) with 9 top tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: nope it works now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East and West doÂ´nt play the same system here|pg||
nt|haans: not in agrement here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would RD there onstead of 2@d, 2ndly i would definitely start with 1@h|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D show support|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: Director at the table asking Jackson about a score in the previous round|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|szalay: if u go to normal games: go as fast as u can...dont give them chance to interfere|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably a preemptive @D raise coming |pg||
nt|szalay: why not 4@H with passed pd?|pg||
nt|frankaus: Ax no the best stopper in the world often better played from Qx side|pg||
nt|szalay: slam is unlikely, @H are good, so?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but unlikely to keep e/w out of 4 @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: you had the one with the picture |pg||
nt|sharkey: appears 4@S can be made - however, may have transportation problems|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: the website|pg||

mb|1S|nt|frankaus: looks like a 30 point deck to E |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: and E with 4333....|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: yes but that is a blog|pg||
nt|ady: n/s likely to play 2@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would even not try it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Standings after 2 rounds: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=85&Itemid=79|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: after 3 rounds actuallly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but i would rebid 1N as West|pg||
mb|p|pc|h8|nt|yuval10: 4@s is some bid by N, P has a very good support though|pg||
nt|yuval10: and now probably bid 5@s ?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Gembick's pass??|pg||
nt|haans: 1n bye North?|pg||

nt|haans: not a nice bid when vul|pg||

pc|s2|nt|szalay: e-w gave them all the chance|pg||
nt|xenya: they might get to a hopeless slam now -- and they did|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S?  rkk ? |pg||
nt|szalay: u can beat 5@C if u play some special (lavinthal, roman) signal over A of @S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|szalay: I think first step to trap was 1@H...after that they came deeper and deeper|pg||

pc|d7|nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|h_karluk: @d9 was indeed a slip in defense - either @hJ or small @c would work better|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: if E has @CA and a spade honour, slam is quite good -- perhaps too much to ask for? |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well i didn't get it, sorry, why i am supposed to play 5/2 @s fit? maybe there's still a 5/4 @d fit, so i liked 1NT rebid - just keeps bidding open, i don't think promises a rose ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: garden :)|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c2|nt|ady: sorry did not see 2@C bid   but was presumably a transfer to 2@D |pg||

nt|copeyj: we can sympathise - he cld only offer a couple of tens to the defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yeah, and he supported Brass, good partner|pg||

nt|szalay: it was an expensive count signal|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: NS will make a lot of tricks here|pg||
nt|szalay: btw udca is better, cause u cant do this kinda "automatic mistake"|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: but E did bid 5@C -- seems that's what W was eager to hear|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: South could have 18+ balanced or any 5-4, passing would be a gamble|pg||
nt|yuval10: cards lie very favourable for them|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|sharkey: a + score is good here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|szalay: I think a tipical mistake to correct in junior age by coach(es): stop slam-greedy|pg||

nt|h_karluk: Nort has just 5 losers, however no entry to table|pg||
pc|s9|nt|szalay: e-w has their 3rd dangerous bidding so far|pg||
nt|haans: i play 3@C as a prempt|pg||
pc|s3|nt|frankaus: put me down as a pass with Wests hand - aceless 4333 even with 14 i would pass|pg||
nt|szalay: double by South?|pg||
nt|ady: 2 spades and a club it seems|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i play as jump rebid|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcoms Szalay |pg||
nt|ady: needs to cash club now|pg||
nt|szalay: normal bidding, normal contract, easy make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@h also works - natural|pg||
nt|yuval10: with some overtricks|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: Jacco's first web site, you can see the beautiful facility |pg||
nt|szalay: he has 2 aces, pd had shown values, they bypassed 3n...SO|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|vugraphzeg: I made the classic mistake 4 and A|pg||
nt|szalay: hi all|pg||

nt|rnmalik: hi and welcome|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
pc|h8|nt|szalay: to bid games, take tricks...and double games when they r in vuln and we see the chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is a reburbished tennis club (still active tennis courts) and quite a terrific bridge facility also |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|copeyj: beat me to it Liz :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: looks like it is strong incorporating a NT range|pg||
nt|lml: west is a bit light for 2@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|cuttysark: Maye Italian style - 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|copeyj: depends what it shows - cld be their way to show 20-22 balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: if thats the case - it is fair enough imo|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|lml: he could argue his hand is worht 20|pg||

mb|3N!|nt|lml: yes apparently it is 20-21|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Fair enough, anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: however you get there 3NT is the normal contract|pg||
pc|dK|nt|henryb:  I would say it is at best a good 19|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|copeyj: id say its at best an accept of a 2N-4N auction - KQTXX is enormous|pg||
nt|lml: I dont know, acey not quacky, five card suit, @C10|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Where is Roland with his calculator when you need him?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: many pairs have changed 2nt-opening as 22-23 and 2@c followed by 2nt as 20-21|pg||
nt|henryb:  why?|pg||
nt|lml: North would have been better to lead the @DQ if it asks for the @DJ|pg||
nt|copeyj: cos i like having a source of tricks when I open 2N|pg||
nt|lml: the diamond spots may be hard to read|pg||
nt|cuttysark: King asks for any unblock|pg||
nt|lml: that works too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: They can stop in a suit on the 2-level with a weak hand to 20-21|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lml: well the club return should end things quickly|pg||

pc|d5|pc|c8|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|lml: the problem with the !K to unblock is if you don't have the king.  You still need to play the !Q to ask for the jack|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c7|nt|copeyj: anyway they got it right whatever their methods are for a push|pg||
mc|11|nt|cuttysark: So you lead Q from AQ10? |pg||
nt|lml: those methods work fine|pg||
nt|lml: you might from AQ1098|pg||
nt|lml: what would you lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: No chances on board 2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They would lead Q from KQxx or KQx - buit never from KQ1098!|pg||

nt|h_karluk: esp when u r a passed hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, 2@c is invitational |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i agree with 3@c rebid, invite or better, i can live with that 5 losers, no matter entry to table, i know no need to cry when they sets, favorable vuln was another tempting factor|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|yuval10: if he wasn't passed hand then 2@d would've been GF|pg||
mb|d!|nt|szalay: in that case I wd go out for water, to refresh myself|pg||
nt|ady: an easy 3NT  played by south|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: terrible slam, imho|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a @C can be pitched on @S but they dont know:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: dont they play Drury?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: During the white house juniors very nice weather last few years|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Dennis Bilde had his moment on the first board. now 1 highpoint average over 3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|frankaus: water? - do u know what fish do in water :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: those hands are usually easy to bid :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: kibs asking 6@D      can make    but bad contract  |pg||
pc|d4|nt|szalay: I think 9 hcp with ruffing values is more than regular 10 hcp|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rnmalik: agree was an observation|pg||
pc|s6|nt|szalay: important thing after bad boards: leave table for a while and reconnect:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: All Israels I know play drury, maybe west didnt think his hand was good enough\|pg||
nt|ady: club lead will need spades 3-3 to pitch losing club   and heart lead will need king well placed|pg||
nt|sybarra: wrongsided this one|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzeg: kleine kamer|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think an imaginary problem there : say east has AQ96-KT983-7-J42, okay guys, would bid 1@h or still double over 1@d? my opinion : if East wld X with that  hand then 2@d cue by W ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: gr8 :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Probably take @C finesse and end up with 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|pc|sA|nt|vugraphzeg: oops that was personal|pg||

nt|hawe45:  North now asks himself: WHY did I take that trick?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|h_karluk: so that matters, 1@h just F1 fine|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Frm AQ10 it depends on how many I have and the auction and whether I have side entries|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lml: ah|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Q would ask doe attitude, so partner would not unblock J, to if ai do not want him to unblock - I lead the Q|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|lml: as long as you have clear agreements most things work fine with honor leads|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|ralfwil: there are two schools if you play a D from that kind of suit. One is that you shall discard yout highest the other is signal for length|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Anyway, the English West went on a solo self-destruct in the other room|pg||
nt|lml: years ago when people were talking about active ethics my partner hesitated before singaling when I have AKxx dummy had JXXX and he had Qxx|pg||
nt|lml: I knew he had the Qxx from the fumbling so I punished him and played 3 rounds of the suit|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|copeyj: to be fair - not bidding at all as west is pretty much as questionable as what went on in the other room - you have a pretty nice hand dont you and you definitely want a @D lead|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||

nt|rnmalik: or bad assessment:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: rebid showed 18-19, so if there is a nearest game why not 3N by S|pg||
nt|szalay: touch and go 4@H|pg||
nt|szalay: it will makes if trump by opps: no option just staright @C hook|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 20-20 1st time there|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|szalay: 5431 is a good treatment|pg||
nt|szalay: Poles invented 5431-convention|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East will welcome a @S-opening + do.-support|pg||
mb|2S|nt|szalay: jump to 3M means: stiff major, 3card other major|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: (no entry back after ruffing finesse)|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: especially usefull if u open 1N with 5card M|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: true but transfer then bid game what do u loose?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 1N then 2@s good, so you can play direct 2@s raise 8-10|pg||
nt|haans: x with void can be costly|pg||
pc|h8|nt|szalay: routin 3N is coming|pg||
nt|szalay: so here 1N-3@H-4@S|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6@S as they lay|pg||
pc|h2|nt|szalay: if no trump lead/switch: he will ruff a @D|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: so 2 @S transfer to minor? |pg||
nt|szalay: but they wont bid with missing ace and trump queen|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think passive trump lead auto there|pg||
nt|szalay: best defence is: cash 3 winners and @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - West should know pd's loaded; however, with 4 HCP too weak|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and maybe @h3 would give a better idea - say 3/5 leads thoroughout in sys card|pg||
pc|c3|nt|szalay: in my book that is a slamtry in M, balanced|pg||
nt|szalay: to lose balanced slamtry with 6bagger is gap, anyway|pg||
nt|yuval10: now declarer can play A and Q@c discarding @s|pg||
nt|szalay: no ruffing finesse is suggested|pg||
nt|szalay: no 100% line, and could be lead from doubleton, but that is the best line, imho|pg||
nt|h_karluk: because you have 2 aces and 3 times trumps, whenever you are in can easily work to cut a ruff|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: Poland got the 11 imps back quickly, when they stopped in game on 2 (6@H was the contract here) |pg||
nt|ady: north minimum  lacking aces   and wasted K@H  definately should settle for game|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|szalay: I think South could bid 4@H with 3 aces over 3@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that would help East to see South has only a @h card|pg||
pc|c5|nt|szalay: imagine North has spade Q instead of K of @H|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our match in roúnd 3, in about 40 minutes, is USA vs Sweden|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|c7|pc|h9|pg||
nt|ady: should make the rest |pg||

mb|2S|an|alert|nt|vugraphzeg: connection was rather slow|pg||
nt|szalay: personally my preference list by Sout over 1@H is:|pg||
nt|szalay: pass, 1N....period....2@C|pg||
nt|haans: suprised they do not play trf here|pg||
nt|sharkey: if it's a "coulda" - probably too close to x at IMPs|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|szalay: do u see any reason not to pass 2@H?|pg||
nt|szalay: or a strength showing double is an option yet|pg||
nt|xenya: on 3, where Israel bid up to 5@D here, the Poles in the other room reached an even worse contract -- 3N -- 3 off and 3 imps to Israel |pg||
nt|h_karluk: in new year teams, we were tied 42-42, then 3 more extension boards, again tied, and last board just won with 1 IMP |pg||
mb|p|nt|VugraphPl1: last board   thanks all |pg||
mb|3N|nt|VugraphPl1: http://michzimny.pl/bridge/2010/pila/gp.html|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D by S?|pg||
nt|xenya: what do you think about N's double?|pg||
nt|frankaus: X do something sensible is a reasonable call |pg||
nt|sybarra: agressive?|pg||
nt|szalay: its normal, imho|pg||
nt|xenya: is it penalty?|pg||
nt|szalay: especially if u play sound overcalls..and send greetings to East for reopen|pg||
nt|xenya: penalty-orinted i should say|pg||
nt|szalay: 8-10, bid sthg, imho|pg||
nt|szalay: I doubt it|pg||
nt|frankaus: no here  - opps bid & raise  X = t/o|pg||
nt|szalay: btw if South passes and North bids @C a BIT easier, but isnt easy yet|pg||
mb|d|nt|szalay: I think North can double 4@S quite confidently|pg||
nt|szalay: or 3N yet..J9xxx in 1 suit, AK9x in other|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: I dont like to play lowlevel dbls as penalty|pg||
nt|xenya: so it was for minors|pg||
nt|szalay: good point, Frank|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Lotan put the Hoody of the sweater on his head after being doubled|pg||
nt|szalay: to lead stiff in pds suit is tempting|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  E/W got the chance...|pg||
nt|sharkey: this match could be a blowout|pg||
nt|haans: can East ever have 4 spades|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - we all know, what England RED means - after this battle|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: typical agressive junior double|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hawe45:  Dangerous double - no defence against 4 @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: I like Dbl instead of 2@S - EW lost the whole 1 level thus they end up in this hopeless contract|pg||
pc|s2|nt|frankaus: if u beat it 1 - what have u gained  - canu really expect to beat it 2 or more?|pg||

pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|szalay: u wont punish for light openings cause light overcalls and vica versa|pg||
nt|szalay: why not to take @C in hand?|pg||
nt|szalay: to start @D ruff?|pg||
nt|frankaus: maybe planning on a dummy reversal|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: he may be thinking same thing,  maybe played too fast |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I could led the right guy lead but he led small club|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|ady: now K@C and club|pg||
nt|h_karluk: okay, say you entered the score, it helps to see in comparison? |pg||
pc|d9|pc|c7|pg||
nt|szalay: to take trick first and think thereafter isnt a good omen|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: why not pitch ht|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is that the exit card?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s9|nt|rnmalik: @H pitchwas better but kept an exit card|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|szalay: why Ten?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that was the question|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|d4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|szalay: but first: make plan, move after that|pg||
nt|ady: down 4|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|d7|pc|s6|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2N|an|*|mb|3H|nt|lml: do you guys like 2NT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not a whole bunch|pg||
nt|copeyj: Brass-Roberts are a new pair - our U20 team is very inexperienced, but we are hoping that this experience in a predominantly u25 field will help prepare them for the 2011 jnr euros|pg||
nt|henryb:  For those who missed it, Zimmerman came from behind to win a very low scoring Vanderbilt final. I think the final score was about 104-97|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lml: I have been busy blogging about the fourth set.  I am just writing the last deal up.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5@C can lose 800, but needs perfect defence - could turn into a save|pg||
nt|lml: the whole match was great bridge|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  I would certainly have bid 5@c with Robert's hand|pg||
pc|c7|nt|cuttysark: Must be accustomed to this sort of effort - he seems to have some defence|pg||
nt|copeyj: me too - and i wouldnt have bid 2N with the N hand - but juniors know what to expect from other juniors :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  but he has better defence against 5@h than against 4.|pg||
nt|lml: after partner bid 2NT most of us would bid 5@C but then our partners would be better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Their cards maybe|pg||
nt|copeyj: these two for England are just 16 and 17, Gembecki/Jackson are 18 and 19, and our other pair are both 16 and 17 too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me it looks like play @dA  and later ruff the 4th @d with @h9 or @h10|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We all have dream partners|pg||
nt|lml: in some ways 4@C is bound to get 4@H|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lml: some people would like to play with themselves... a sort of bridge cline|pg||
nt|lml: clone|pg||
nt|henryb:  nah. I'm not good enough for me to play with|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I often do that at BBO. Walddk2 and 3 vs 4 and 5|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|lml: my dream partner would play quickly, never yell, stay calm, and be a better player than me|pg||
nt|cuttysark: All of my partners dream|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: LOL|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The bidding has told that there is no other play in @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: cheats Roland :)|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: As Terence Rees used to say - overcalling weak 2-suiters merely helps declarer play the hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  he could of courst just draw trump|pg||
nt|henryb:  and take the 10 tricks the bridge gods dealt him|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|cuttysark: That would be straightforward :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: too easy tht way - more fun to play around for a while|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why choose that play? because if N can follow with one @h|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c8|pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h8|nt|lml: he has a plan|pg||
nt|henryb:  North already showed out on the first heart|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am not over the moon about this line|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|lml: its like drawing trump only more slowly|pg||
nt|henryb:  why did South duck the trump? declarer had gone down|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lml: well I think he cant go down anymore|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think maybe our operator has found out that it is not always easy to follow the play|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|mc|10|nt|henryb:  and North threw winners and kept losers|pg||
nt|cuttysark: (As a paid up member of the Operators Union I sympathise deeply)|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: missed 1 discard|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: guessed it was @d, but wrong ;)|pg||

nt|szalay: I know its U25|pg||

nt|szalay: it looks an interesting 3N|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!|pg||
nt|szalay: does West have way to show @D lead?|pg||
nt|szalay: or may be HIS lead, even better:)|pg||
nt|ady: if west is on lead to 3NT  may choose a heart when east has shown majors|pg||
nt|szalay: a bit optimistic, but acceptable 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: thanks all, esp fellow commentators & operator|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are back in about 1/2 hour |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes play went very fast here so that is why|pg||
nt|szalay: fast play seldom means good|pg||
nt|frankaus: fine operating Jacco <clap> <clap> <clap> <clap>|pg||
nt|szalay: I think South has INV with @Cs, lets say 3@C is normal or 2N...|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|an|T/O|nt|vugraphzeg: it was west thinking but i try to do 2 bids at a time|pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks like it should make |pg||
nt|szalay: r u sure?|pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder|pg||
nt|szalay: 1@S, 1@H and how many @Cs?|pg||
nt|ady: looks like west has mis understood partners bid|pg||
nt|szalay: its Molenaar's double session|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: west might have explained this as weak with @d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: imho 5@c unbelievable|pg||
nt|haans: 3 down in 5@Cx|pg||
nt|haans: 2|pg||
mb|3C|nt|h_karluk: possibly 3@s would come|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: I think its going down for @S lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes!!  here we go again|pg||
nt|szalay: 6@C for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: East wasnt passing, I could tell you that|pg||
nt|xenya: E seems to have taken partner's 4@C too seriously|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what would you lead vs 5@c ? @h A/K or @s A+x ? :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: E likes his hand|pg||
mb|3D|nt|haans: dbl gazzili like bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: if u travel across the World, better to agree 2suiter overcalls|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: the problem was the semi natural 1@c openingbid i think|pg||
nt|szalay: if a bid (semi)natural, better to treat it as natural, eg. to play (1m)-2m as Michaels vs. prepared 1m yet|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to misguess hts here also |pg||
nt|h_karluk: obviously - east players happy with that 7 hcp|pg||
nt|yuval10: maybe too much for a 4-3-3-3 hand|pg||
mb|3H|nt|szalay: but grand slam try with missing ace was a mistake, anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 1430, I guess|pg||
nt|xenya: admittedly, he does have a great hand|pg||
nt|szalay: nbo pressure for N-S now|pg||
nt|szalay: the real issue is 3m is nat or stopper asking|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|szalay: time for @S switch yet, and likely 2 off|pg||
nt|szalay: c u in 30 minutes|pg||
nt|szalay: byebye|pg||
mb|4C|nt|h_karluk: thanks, you interpreted my feelings :)|pg||
nt|szalay: it will be push, thx all, c u soon|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thx buddy, c ya soon|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: once again holy ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a-ha North pushes his opps to game|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@C er helt ude i hampen|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|sharkey: Sac vs 3@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: this stands no chance of course -- let's see if he can get out for -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: sorry for speaking Danish|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: bed time here back latter in day european time|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes this happened, north couldnt play south for 4@D|pg||
nt|xenya: i doubt that -- W's clubs are too small|pg||
nt|xenya: setting up @Ds would mean seetting up trump tricks for N|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu frank @H |pg||
nt|xenya: but i overlooked the fact that the defence had presented E with a trick -- now he certainly can make 11 and must be thinking how to get 12  |pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: can establish spades    but has no trump control|pg||
nt|h_karluk: !k was the lead i expected|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h K|pg||
nt|sharkey: Actually first time the Danes made a "crazy" bid this match I think|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: however their maters scored +620|pg||

nt|szalay: 2 or 3 down is the question now|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|xenya: it looks so close... -- but can't be managed i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: very close,  pity for E the clubs do not break |pg||
nt|szalay: 3 off: -5 imp|pg||
pc|s7|nt|szalay: 2 off: +3|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  has to be less than 3 down |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Lets say J@S and @DA and another @D would reduce losses somewhat|pg||
nt|szalay: if he leads @H to king: -5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|VugraphPl1: 100%|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: or spades 4/3 |pg||
mc|9|nt|h_karluk: bye|pg||
nt|ritong: no matter what, simply raise whenever possible  here, the 1 @s bid left them in 3@h with a close to slam hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty all - bye|pg||
nt|haans: next match 50 minutes|pg||
