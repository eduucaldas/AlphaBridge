mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW in 4th with 68    NS 10th with 40|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: and 6@c is worse played by South|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: agree. Both jaws is on N|pg||
nt|jallerton: A spade lead looks most likely|pg||
nt|jallerton: forcing declarer to finesse at trick 1|pg||
nt|xenya: best lead -- unbid suit, that simple|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards for all participants are online|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2010/OpenWom/systems.html|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: and an equally quick 2 down i suppose|pg||
nt|ralfwil: too bad communications to aviod tge @s finess|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: EW leads are 1-3-5 against trumph and 2.4. against nt|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the @s finess|pg||
nt|jallerton: It's a shame Roland isn't playing in the Danish Teams.  I'm sure he'd be in this one!|pg||
nt|xenya: presents declarer with a club trick but gains a vital tempo|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|santyclz: Ouch, 3nt by s is a lot easier.|pg||
nt|jbgood: and game in @h - one of the denominations available to get the gaqme bonus|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! a typical Roland:)|pg||

nt|jbgood: 12 of the 14 imps difference was the starting point - as a carry over from a previous encounter|pg||
nt|xenya: well done by NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: ready for actionboard :)|pg||
nt|othered1: This may be fun, depending upon who gets hung first by the misfit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bbo is set up to make this look like team match, but actually a PAIR event|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 tables in play, scored against datum|pg||
nt|poohbear: well we move from a small slam to a grand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both of these pairs use multi-purpose opening 2-bids -- most everything else is natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lilley-Nagy strong NT  Delivera-Robinson ACOL with Weak NT|pg||
nt|mwigor: hi al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome back Michael!|pg||
mb|1C|nt|peacokk: EW better stay low on this one|pg||
nt|jbgood: the Blakset lead is a carry over from previous encounter|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: NS playing 5card major and 15-17nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: EW plays 5-card major and 14+-17 nt|pg||
nt|jbgood: if N can get to know that Auken has a 5 card @d suit - difficult if Fredin jumps in|pg||
nt|xenya: we are in for a bit of fun here i think |pg||
nt|othered1: 7 needs a little luck in @D|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzey: 3@h = 10-12 and 3@s|pg||
nt|jallerton: EW play strong NT, NS play weak NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d = 5+@c and eighter invitational to game or invitational to slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2nt = minors|pg||
nt|othered1: may turn out to be a test of NS's countermethods to unusual NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I guess NS plays 3@c from North = I have my own suit and I want to bid at least game|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@s = I have my @s-suit|pg||
nt|othered1: Most pairs play something along the lines of "unusual/unusual" where minor suit bids distinguish hands with major suit lengths.|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer has to decide how to play @ds in the grand. percentage is to take the finesse since there arent enuff entries to ruff 3@ds|pg||
nt|poohbear: dbl shows the majors I suspect|pg||
nt|othered1: I see four entries in @C|pg||
nt|poohbear: you are right|pg||
nt|poohbear: so ruffing out the suit is correct|pg||
nt|poohbear: makes the grand about 68%  well worth bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|othered1: Yes it is, if you are sure the opponents will be in small slam.  For whatever chance they aren't, increases the odds you need on the grand|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: indeed -- what should N do now -- would 3@H be forcing -- or should he double or cuebid first|pg||
nt|xenya: so cuebid it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@h directly after 2nt is not forcing -- but 3@c is forcing with own suit - 3@d would have been forcing with @s support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: according to CC   1@C supposed to be  any 15+ |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: this is the longest Ive ever seen it taken to go 1c/1h/1s|pg||
nt|poohbear: Very few partnerships have adequate methods to deal with 2@c interference|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: maybe 2@h shows a weak NT type hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: sr I cant explain 2@h and 2@s ... South has not asked W yet :(|pg||
nt|jallerton: http://www2.bridge.dk/Systemkort.aspx?ID=375 for convention cards|pg||
nt|xenya: that didn't get them too far, did it|pg||
nt|othered1: if that's a cue-bid, not simply showing @H with game values (my method)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = FG, 25+BAL or weak 2@H/@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: the double by N paid off|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=9+ HCP 5+@S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: hmmm in that context, seems 2@S should be weak 2@S opening|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzey: 4nt = 1430 |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 5@c = one ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@h shows only 3-card @c ... and a weak nt-hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: I was close!|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: yes ... you are good :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, makes sense -- 3@C shows @Hs, 3@D would show a spade fit|pg||
nt|othered1: On the auction, 4@H is high enough.  With quiet EW's might get quite a bit higher|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: yes and 3@h natural nonforcing and 3@s natural support nonforcing|pg||
nt|mwigor: think you're looking at the wrong system card al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh -- Richman-Peake are EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok    1@C=2+   1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|mwigor: 1@h did in fact show @s though|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: not easy to see how many tricks declarer can take|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peake was south last set   AND  i have dain bramage|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like Nagy is using the same Convention Card that I am :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: one of the least discussed aspects of partnership|pg||
nt|othered1: Many partnerships use the pass over the double to show some values, redoubliing with a double-negative.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|vugraphzey: NS leads 1.3.5.|pg||
nt|poohbear: this should wrap easily. Could Gill have bid 7? Hard to imagine that you are off an ace when partner leaps to slam|pg||
nt|othered1: If that's your agreement, it's reasonable to play suits by responder as natural.  Here north could show values and @D simply by bidding 2@D.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jbgood: was 4@c just a game force?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 4@c is explained as 2-suiter and GF |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|jbgood: a likely 2 down..|pg||
nt|jbgood: the double by N was really a tough bid|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jallerton: maybe direct 3@c over 2@h would have been stronger and he has to go via 2@s to sign off|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|santyclz: Alerted so might be more.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Jan.|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Peter Fredin is now calling the TD about th first board ... and the TD has arrived now |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Peter Fredin is explaining to the TD |pg||
nt|jbgood: wrong explanations?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
nt|xenya: not that the contract is in any danger but still|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Pip, our vugraph operator gives this table talk    Lilley: sorry pd|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|c6|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jallerton: it looks as though declarer will have to fall back on the @d finesse.  |pg||
pc|h9|nt|jallerton: He might be able to make it double dummy with a red suit squeeze against South, but that must be worse odds|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes ackerly seniors and cartner-palmer for women, bristow-livingstone and robb-janisz are the reserves|pg||
pc|c7|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|peacokk: I think it's too hard|pg||
nt|xenya: i can count 11 now|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|jbgood: i do too|pg||
pc|c3|pc|hK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jbgood: and the final double may have warned about the bad trump split so much that declarer actually may bet out cheaper than with no opposition bidding|pg||
nt|jallerton: or perhaps even endplaying South with 3 rounds of trumps|pg||

nt|vugraphzey: ready for the next one -- hopefully we'll not be disconnected anymore :)|pg||
nt|xenya: we need a new board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we have a very small group in this room -- holler if there's anything special you want me to rant about|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Thus letting the double work for the opener's side.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: there are 2 ways to play 1@C-1@H:1@S/1N   some say 1@S=3@S [1N is weak NT with 2@S]  others  1@S=2/3@S so 1N becomes 17-19 or 18-20 [stronger than 1N opener]|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|othered1: Steve Robinson -- "always open a 5-card major" -- wouuld approve of south's action.   But most players would open this hand 1@H, if they open at all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S normally 5+ --- but this is great lead director in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: 2@h= 12-15hcp and natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: if they open with a natural 1-bid, that is.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|nt|jallerton: trump lead should be on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I guess @c K|pg||
nt|ahollan1: CC doesn't describe the passed hand 2N -- but sure looks like they are NOT playing Drury|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N not forcing  [not sure if that is same as Semi-Forcing]|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzey: I got it|pg||
nt|jallerton: did you have inside information, Jan?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: me ... nooo|pg||
nt|othered1: can I assume double was penalty-oriented?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|santyclz: The controversial 3-card raise.  I like it.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jbgood: the low club lead may induce N to continue the suit.. |pg||
nt|peacokk: Will Konow be able to read @C3?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: W said: "Make some room for these" when he put down the @ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: dbl = penalty|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: but South is a chicken and pull to 3@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW standard signals|pg||
nt|ahollan1: concensus is 2N=max with 3@S    that's the bid that Drury handles with 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Michael is abandoning us for one of Women's tables|pg||
nt|poohbear: Neill treating his hand as 5-6?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|othered1: Trump split doesn't help this, but favorable @H position may be useful.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jbgood: some like it, I prefer 4 card raise unless no other bid..|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, all|pg||
nt|xenya: hello again|pg||
nt|othered1: @S position isn't necessarily clear to east.  Couldn't south be 2=5=1=5?|pg||
nt|othered1: Of coiurse, east is thinking about lots more than the play to this trick.|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I have been told that the open room "crashed" -- but now we are back - but this board has been played - and South won 8 tricks|pg||
nt|poohbear: It will be hard for him to imagine his partner is 4-7|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jbgood: many lead the second best from a bad suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: NS leads are 2.4.|pg||
nt|jbgood: second from top i mean|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: but later in the "game" they play 2.4. with attitude -- so then they play 2. from 4 bad ones|pg||
nt|othered1: Certainly a possible result|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|santyclz: Although this may not be the poster-child hand for it.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you want  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/    lets you spy on ALL ongoing vugraph matches -- one window per table|pg||
pc|c3|nt|othered1: Looks like it, but it isn't 6-5 and could be costly if partner had thoughts of going on.|pg||

nt|jbgood: he may just make it|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c4|nt|poohbear: they land in an OK spot. Prob goes down on a @s lead|pg||

nt|peacokk: np|pg||
nt|jallerton: an overtrick imp for N/S probably|pg||
nt|Walddk11: They placed the tray on the wire and off we were|pg||
nt|poohbear: prob figured that East would surely have dbled 3@d with KJ109xx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: small audience tonight -- let me know if there is anything special I should address in my ravings|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 3NT on E looks good|pg||
mb|1C|nt|fabsayc: good day folks|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: in ACO, 2@H is just 1-round force|pg||
nt|poohbear: or AKJ109x|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=ART, 9-14, 4+@S, maybe longer @C/@D, NEG DBL => 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=NF, 6-10|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jbgood: yes - 2 down means the ten - nice defense|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@s = 10-12 and 3@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: suspect we'll see 2@S-4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: West is worth a reverse|pg||
nt|poohbear: not sure what NT range EW are playing but I am sure Gill is not evaluating it as weak|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder what Steve Robinson would say about that 1@D opening -- he espouses that not opening a 5-card major denies holding one.  So with things like 5=1=0=7, he'd open 1@S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk11: They should be spanked|pg||
nt|poohbear: I dont like Gosney's dbl. He cant possibly know a @s lead is correct against 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: here are the action again|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: must admit i have never had to defend againt this kind of 2@C opener|pg||
nt|frankaus: this is Match 3/9 to decide the aust open team top 3 of 10 pairs will form a team|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but i would bid 2@S now, a kind of pass the buck bid|pg||
nt|frankaus: many play it here |pg||
nt|poohbear: These auctions are very tuff on the dbling pair. Need very solid agreements as to whats what|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reynolds wondering about 2@H vs DBL|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jbgood:   1 was duplicated both biddingwise and resultwise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or .... delayed Splinter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other rooms will have same problem but after 1@S or 2@S opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kanektar started with DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the "match" score is an illusion.  This is a PAIR event but BBO handles teams better than pairs|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would pass and reopen 3@cs with a dbl when it came around to me|pg||
pc|d3|nt|frankaus: 2@C both Majors is a good method IMO , allows u to bid 2@D with no real preference of 2M with a pref, of 2Nt if game interest or better|pg||
nt|othered1: and no idea whatever that he can beat 2@SXX|pg||
nt|poohbear: ahhhh dbl is To of @cs|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: NS will get the spanking instead i'm afraid|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would have bid it faster, this slow bid is for sure only a 4 card suit|pg||
nt|poohbear: for instance is this dbl TO or penalty?|pg||
nt|poohbear: of 2@h|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Alerted from both as T/O :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: I guess they discussed this :)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  1NT was 15-17|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a unilateral penalty double in front of the length is so rare as to not be worth using|pg||
nt|poohbear: Gill has to be worried about pushing them to a makeable game|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: with such a sparce hand, i hadn't considered 4@D - especially if EW play that 2@S can be passed|pg||
nt|poohbear: I guess thats a safer way to play|pg||
pc|d8|nt|poohbear: thats why he isnt competing|pg||
nt|othered1: That's a good  treatment (what I use, also).|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jallerton: South may try the effect of @sJ or @SK here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Difficult lead for S|pg||
nt|jallerton: his heart pips do not make that suit attractive|pg||
nt|xenya: @HQ now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: @h Q is taken and put back again|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Jens is certainly thinking about @h Q|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Sorry, lost the play here.|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: I'll give you the result :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think I'd try @CQ -- but no lead automagic|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and @C other than Ace :)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: You was right Jeffrey!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in OZ - do your ACOL players say 2/1 is forcing to a certain level, or can opener's rebid be passed?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nagy-Lilley using upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Dwayne Hoffman|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just no small @S :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|frankaus: G'day Dwayne|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but still 9 tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzey: south is thinking.....|pg||
nt|jbgood: he may go down now, but when the spade ten came to light I think he might just have played trumps|pg||
nt|keylime:  greetings all from Manassas Park, VA - nice to be here|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh my, derailed now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi Dwayne|pg||
nt|poohbear: as it turns out he cant even make 3@H|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jbgood: losing 2 spades and a club|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 club ruffs available|pg||
nt|jbgood: but difficult for N to see?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Everybody agree with 4@h?|pg||
nt|frankaus: scoring is IMPs V a mean datum of the middle 3 tables|pg||

nt|xenya: considering that the auction may well be duplicated in the other room, this might not be all that bad |pg||
nt|ahollan1: this could be fun|pg||
nt|frankaus: sponsors do put money into the game allowing some to play pro when they could not afford to play otherwise, but there some who  dont like that|pg||
nt|keylime:  300 undoubled - living a bit of a charmed life there South is.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ouch|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: If South responds 1@S that will slow West down|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer took the percentage play. Assuming he thought North had a @h honor|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jallerton: or 1@h transfer|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 1@h = transfer|pg||
nt|jallerton: 4+@s|pg||

nt|vugraphzey: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: and might have longer @d suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: or longer @c suit|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Nagy has a few options  because of  a) strong 6@S  b) 3@H & void c) good 2nd suit|pg||
nt|poohbear: TO dbl?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: ok.do you want professional player?|pg||

nt|othered1: Is it now normal to overcall 1N with iffy 15 counts?|pg||

nt|frankaus: bob richman is our no1 masterpoint holder|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N=11-14 HCP, if 4@H/@S 11-12|pg||
mb|2D|nt|poohbear: r|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps in second seat not vul|pg||
nt|poohbear: 1D shows @h|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|peacokk: S thinks he has a 15-17NT|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@h was brave|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@d = natural - normally longer @d|pg||
nt|poohbear: 1NT denies 3@h and shows a weak NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: ns plays 1nt as 12-14 in first and second seat .... and 15-17 in third|pg||
nt|peacokk: oh, sorry|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like 3@h is the limit for EW|pg||
nt|jallerton: now West justified to jump to game|pg||
nt|xenya: i've seen people doing that over and over again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gosney only bid 4@C  and Hans-Nunn bid a grand .... but 7N down 1 won't score well at all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@C-6@D:6@H   just maybe |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S by Reynolds is part of the YBYSIBM System|pg||
nt|ahollan1: You Bid Your Suit  I Bid Mine|pg||
nt|poohbear: Gill giving the opps one more shot at bidding game. But normal to reopen|pg||
mb|3D|nt|othered1: I don't play hands well enough to be able to afford that|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: duplication is difficult when W opens 1nt in the other room (playing weak nt) :)|pg||
nt|xenya: however that was not to happen -- N doubled in the other room|pg||
nt|poohbear: wouldnt be my choice but might be dictated by system|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would bid 2@c if able|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  only 2@H/@S are natural|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: mouse problem it was a low @H to Ace :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: remember this isn't really a team match --- the Australian Trials [aka Playoffs] is run as a PAIR event|pg||
mb|3H|nt|othered1: I'd bid onemore on west's hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: me too|pg||
nt|othered1: My partners don't solo to the 3-level to give the opponents numbers.|pg||
nt|poohbear: looks like down 2 unless the defnse loses their @d ruff. Declarer still needs to pick up @ds by leading high twice out of his hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: pins the 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: you couldnt know :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzey: 2@c is forcing 2@d .. and now 2@h is invit with 5+@h|pg||
nt|xenya: instead of 1NT|pg||
nt|othered1: Isn't this now cold?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so -- we only know what ONE of the other pairs has done    there are actually 8 tables in play|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: easy 9 tricks|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jallerton: South had to lead a @d to beat this I think|pg||
nt|poohbear: We can certainly make a case for dbling with the East hand over either 1 or 2 @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: lots of guessing here, but i think Reynolds will have to place @CQ in West and one honor in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: kudos to Robinson for the pressure bid of 5@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we can see 13 are available, but Lilley will take his time to find best line for TWELVE tricks|pg||
nt|frankaus: Andrew Peake is a well regarded partner, very calm, but often really sneeky, NS a real dangerous opps|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a @d lead had been better|pg||
pc|c4|nt|peacokk: Interesting lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jallerton: (or let his partner lead a club out of turn)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another solution:)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: and we'll never know if Robinson would have given Delivera a @C ruff against 7@H :(|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|poohbear: now the defense should get their ruff|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|poohbear: or perhaps not :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|poohbear: this should make given the luicky @d lie|pg||
nt|poohbear: though now declarer has opened a potential @h threat|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south can count the hand and lead a low diamond now|pg||
nt|poohbear: tricky 2 of @ds might not work so well|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: most would just claim 9 and save time|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pitch hearts|pg||
pc|cT|nt|poohbear: dunno why he did that|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|poohbear: could play @cs just as easily from hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: now - don't even need to guess @H --- well done|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|poohbear: so down 1|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: that will work, but not sure it is best line to guarantee the slam   i was still working thru options :(|pg||
nt|frankaus: David Lilley played in a long term partnership with Ron Klinger - highly regarded, |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mwigor: did EW actually get any tricks?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jbgood: out of the ordinary - i think a simple spade lead is the long term winner|pg||
pc|s4|mc|11|nt|djneill: that was a difficult choice of leads - 3-3 in the unbid suits, he chose the @c rather than the 3 good @h|pg||

nt|mwigor: pitch on @c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All 13. 7 spades, 5 clubs, 1 diamond|pg||

nt|mwigor: they kept crashing|pg||

mb|1C|nt|santyclz: Yes.  Fredin knew it too, but was able to talk himself out of it...|pg||
nt|jallerton: EW should buy this in 2@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gill made a Lightner double of 7@H which made Hans run to 7N|pg||
nt|keylime:  Dan, if you were to lead hearts for some reason, probably the J@h hits the table?|pg||
nt|djneill: right|pg||
nt|keylime:  2@d the multi here it looks like|pg||
nt|poohbear: catherine|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kiwibridge: looks like EW make 3@D/@H so could be a swing here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jbgood: game on for both sides - even a slam EW:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@s = 8-10 and 3@s|pg||
nt|othered1: I think he had time to play south for 2@H and @DAxx.|pg||
nt|djneill: playing against this kind of multi, you don't worry about the 25+ GF bal variety, what is it like 30-1 odds against?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Lets see how Ebery deals with this|pg||
nt|poohbear: p p |pg||
nt|poohbear: I think|pg||
nt|poohbear: undo Catharine|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: I play 1@s as natural in this spot|pg||
nt|poohbear: and dbl as TO|pg||
mb|2N|nt|keylime:  Here's a bid that depending where one is in the world, it is either very common, or like here in North America, very tightly regulated with prepared defenses required by the pair using it|pg||
nt|keylime:  I think more than that Dan - suspect it's over 40-1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: at least 500-1 against the 25+|pg||
nt|frankaus: Little Old Ladies use it here at most clubs|pg||
nt|poohbear: but they choose to show the overcall instead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2+@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: back again|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jbgood: dbl for 500?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@H = transfer to @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Easier to find @hQ without that @h10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Delivera PASS??    if not opening weak NT -- why not 1@H [showing 4+]|pg||
nt|poohbear: Gold might just force this to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: RDBL=4+@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but perhaps easts only chance to play against @dQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N then Nagy gets to flip a coin|pg||
nt|keylime:  And here they have changed the regs so that you can not use it at at in most situations; think they tagged a 12 board requirement for acceptable use|pg||
nt|fabsayc: totally disagree with doubling 2h, that should be takeout of hearts|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2NT here should be take out|pg||
nt|othered1: 4-3-3-3 double that most players seem to  make today|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: yup|pg||

pc|s5|nt|othered1: aThis could be a problem as dummy isn't entry laden|pg||

nt|othered1: do y ou go after @S at once and how?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow -- that took out the entire site|pg||
nt|djneill: South should have bid over 2@s I think, very nice hand for having passed over 2@d and pd spoke|pg||
nt|poohbear: too likely to lose a dbl partscore swing and 7 imps|pg||
nt|othered1: Nor I.  Getting opponents to the 3-level isn't only a matchpoints strategy. |pg||
nt|poohbear: looks like 2@s and 3@ds are both borderline to make|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: ew leads are 1.3.5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|peacokk: Isn't Blaksets 5@D strange?|pg||
nt|peacokk: If partner has @C+@H ...?|pg||
nt|poohbear: One thing that a lot of experts do these days is differentiate between 3 and 4 card raises|pg||
pc|cA|nt|poohbear: I would bid 2NT to show a limit raise + with 4 trumps|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jbgood: Fredin may get endplayed here to lead up from one of his kings|pg||
nt|xenya: can make it double dummy of course but probably that wouldn't be percentage play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Women are playing the same boards as the Open|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  5 McLeish-Bourke  bid & made 6@H  as did King-Neale|pg||
nt|poohbear: reserve the Q bid for 3 trump raises|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jallerton: he needs a @d trick or a 3rd heart|pg||
pc|s4|nt|poohbear: Declarer wont misguess @hs knowing that Gill cant have 3@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside down count & attitude|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: EW have been pushed up but still make I think|pg||
nt|peachy: the impossible club lead needed to set this, EW did well to compete|pg||
pc|sA|nt|frankaus: t/o of @S common treatment here|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jallerton: not both|pg||
nt|dburn: in isolation, you should play those spades for four tricks by leading ace and another, but the entry position does not really lend itself to that|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: this auction not going anywhere fast so 2@C was fine|pg||
pc|c8|nt|santyclz: Declarer can always make this if he guesses correctly, going to be a slow hand.|pg||
nt|mwigor: interestingly reynolds had to play back a @c there double dummy - i cant work out why|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: stay away from GIB!!!|pg||
nt|mwigor: a @h or @c pitch is fine now|pg||
nt|poohbear: as the opps are disconnected in @cs declarer can make this if he reads the positon|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jbgood: may go wrong now|pg||
nt|santyclz: (I would make this about 1 time out of 5.)|pg||
nt|poohbear: he can endplay West in @hs|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|nt|jbgood: but 300 still chea¨p|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, what with both queens being entries, West would have been fine if he had played ace and a spade, but he could not know this|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|poohbear: even if he rises King when West ducks he can exit a spade and score the last 3 @h tricks|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kiwibridge: it was a NT other room, xfer to @H then a backin 2@S stole it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6 nice imps to Gosney|pg||

pc|h7|nt|djneill: North here can count 5@h, 1@s, 2@c and can take a safe @d hook (surely opening bidder has the @sK vul|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Richman was going to get @H right anyway|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jbgood: with his balancing 3 @c an endplay like in not unthinkable - and S returns to hand with the red suit that W has discarded from..|pg||

nt|jallerton: North's @h did not cost - if he plays a 4th club, declarer ruffs and builds a @d trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: match back to ALL SQUARE --- if it ends this way Konow is in the final tomorrow|pg||
nt|othered1: I've been in worse slams than this one.|pg||

nt|poohbear: a good result for NS in the other room|pg||
nt|poohbear: not clear to bid 4@h and certainly not clear to make it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: very good, should be down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing South for specifically 3424|pg||
nt|peachy: the impossible. "wrong hand" impossible among other things...|pg||
nt|othered1: a nice little result.  I'd like it better at matchpoints|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: 3nt= good minor preempt ... not a running minorsuit|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 12-14 nt|pg||
nt|jallerton: as the remaining @d were the 4 and the A|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Very true, Jan.|pg||
nt|jallerton: and clubs were 4-4 originally|pg||
nt|djneill: N-S play transfer openings, as if they were responding to an opening 1N almost - 1@c asks, 1@d shows @h, 1@h shows @s, and 1@s is minor suit stayman|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it seems like 4@H can be made|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@d multi. I presume|pg||
nt|poohbear: though might be strong or weak 2 in @h|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which explains the earlier 2h with balanced strong hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: ty Fee|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS 1N=15-"most" 18|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: oops. miscounted|pg||
nt|keylime:  transfer openings and canape it seems too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+   still|pg||
mb|1N|nt|peacokk: This is down on a @D lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: Erik, I think 4 NT was always for minors, with another 2-suiter E may double (looks like that is how they play)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=long @D|pg||
nt|mwigor: 1@s is @d or no Major|pg||
mb|2S|nt|othered1: On simply the @C finesse and no first round ruff|pg||
nt|xenya: is 2@S just spades or a 2-suiter?|pg||
nt|poohbear: whoever said 200 was the kiss of death in MPs  hasnt been -110 very often :)|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jallerton: 2@c = majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: just @s|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks|pg||
nt|keylime:  canape for those that do not know, is a method where you bid a 4 card suit, before a five card suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H is much better from north hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: forced by system|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: North might have been able to double 1@s for takeout (1@d showed @h), but he chose not to, maybe too weak?|pg||
nt|djneill: 2@h was a "cue-bid" likely (getting dizzy)|pg||
nt|frankaus: NS CC at - http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2010/OpenWom/Peake-Richman.pdf|pg||
nt|keylime:  only if S was on a max I would come in to compete in a minor|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dburn: awkward for South, this - sometimes hard to end up in clubs even when partner bids them, since he might not have them|pg||
nt|poohbear: Or VG operator is Fiona Brown. An Aussie transplanted in England . She is on the English ladies team|pg||
mb|d|nt|djneill: West is suspecting the 4-4 @h fit, the singleton @h lead through dummy... getting turned off|pg||
nt|othered1: because of too few major suit cards?|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@c starts invitational auctions|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@d was forced|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: NS plays that north might have only 2clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: Then this hand is a minus for their methods|pg||
nt|dburn: probably, you should play transfers so that South could start with 2NT to show clubs, but...|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 1@c eighter natural or a nt-hånd|pg||
nt|poohbear: so 10 imps to Peake|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: but might be a gain because @c K offside|pg||
nt|dburn: ...no harm done here - the methods kept North-South out of a decent slam that was going down, so the methods themselves will not be revised tomorrow|pg||
nt|xenya: EW had a nice save available -- 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the Vanderbilt Final -- with 11 boards remaining the Fleisher [USA] leads Zimmermann [France]  by 14|pg||
nt|poohbear: Gill must have dbled|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: is my guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure why Reynolds would not rebid 1N --- maybe that absolutely denies 3+@D|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@s is very conservative. BUT these guys open very light|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mwigor: yes that looked odd|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jbgood: even the nice trump holding wont give E 8 tricks here..|pg||
nt|othered1: Do you see any reason for south to continue, unless they may have opened much lighter?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|djneill: shouldn't East have respected West's 2@s? What do you think frank?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or worried about @H??|pg||
nt|poohbear: The reason South didnt open 1@d to prepare this auction is: 1@D shows 5|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jbgood: and Ace is the texbook lead against a gambling 3 NT - not successful this time|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: i bet that's why we have such a small audience|pg||
nt|poohbear: Fiona was so busy reading the press about herself she missed it :P|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think South would pass 3@s as well|pg||
nt|othered1: yes|pg||
pc|d9|nt|frankaus: please note the Open room score is just 1 table of 5, the scoring id done V a mean datum of the middle 3 tables |pg||
nt|fabsayc: the easiest way to combat these artificial openings is to treat as if natural in the suit shown|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and yes in that case pass of 2@S seems correct|pg||
nt|frankaus: i support with 3 in ths sutuation and we pla @S|pg||
nt|poohbear: 10 of @s away from a decent game at imps|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c6|nt|frankaus: 2@H prob a cue raise with game interest|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: lol nah i was looking up their system notes - sorry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good shift|pg||
nt|ahollan1: presumably 1@S always says  NOT 4@H/@S|pg||
pc|c4|nt|peachy: another small pickup for gosney|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes, but I'm told this is butler pairs not teams|pg||
pc|cA|nt|frankaus: 2NT is a further gametry |pg||
nt|othered1: But as the cards lie, they needed a @D shift right there to hold it to 3|pg||
nt|poohbear: I have the NS facts wrong. They do open 1@d with 4.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: down only 1 now|pg||
pc|h9|nt|frankaus: but W was not going on|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|poohbear: this is the defense to beat 4|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|poohbear: but perhaps they choose this method of dealing with 4-5|pg||
pc|c5|nt|xenya: they would have probably bid that had W supported -- |pg||
pc|cK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but declarer can make double dummy|pg||

pc|dT|pc|s3|nt|poohbear: making 4 now|pg||
nt|othered1: I have to open south 1@C (and rebid @C over 1@S) since 1@D-2@C rebid is specialized.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: probably better chance at overtrick by playing 3 rounds of diamonds ending in DUMMY  then declarer knows if @D is good or not and might have distribution info to decide about @s ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i guess ok in 3 but position was pretty clear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i just got whiplash|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: just using othertable for comparisons on BBO|pg||
nt|peachy: oh, then who knows at this point.  Nicely judged anyway to stop at 4H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it will be a guide for us anyway|pg||
nt|poohbear: I solve these hands by opening 1@d but thats a personal choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: none of the players will be caught and fined for violating the speedlimit|pg||
nt|dburn: particularly if 1@c does not show clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I think EW plays 1@c as at least a 3-card @c :)|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@c, however, does show clubs|pg||
nt|poohbear: and rebidding @cs|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S!|nt|jallerton: 2@d Multi includes 3-7HCP weak 2s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 2nt as S|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d = weak major -- 3-7 hcp ... with 8-11 they open 2 in the majorsuit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Robinson didn't have a Weak 2@D mechanism|pg||
nt|poohbear: Im told this is pair based so the team scores arent real|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=ART, 9-14, 4+@H, maybe longer @C/@D, NEG DBL => 4@S|pg||
nt|othered1: That's old-fashioned standard and still right if your @D-@C auctions are natural.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Defense needed to find the @d shift after the first or second round of @hs to beat game|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: that @dA cash seems a little dangerous - what if East has the @dJ and @c are 4-4 then 2NT makes while cashing the clubs then a @h through always sets it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=ART, F, 11+ HCP|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzey: 2@d = 5+@h|pg||
nt|jbgood: N wants to jumpaccept|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@c= majors|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Nagy 1@C=2+|pg||
nt|frankaus: is this the worst 17 ever?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: :) ... but it is not often speedlimit is that low :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: guess 2 NT meant something to that effect|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: we are playing with screens -- and the alerts I make is the alerts and explanations I make is made by W and S|pg||
nt|peacokk: They may play new suit as weak doubleton and 3@H as a minimum 4-card raise?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: is it easy to overtake here?|pg||
nt|poohbear: given these boys opening bid style I find the 3@c bid too aggressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: indeed, seems can never be right|pg||
nt|poohbear: he has chances for a minor suit slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know the relay structure :(|pg||
nt|mwigor: looks like natural|pg||
nt|othered1: agree, with only 3 trumps. |pg||
nt|poohbear: Gill might well have countered with his hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: game is no bargain tho|pg||
nt|poohbear: and Gos would not have accepted|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzey: the lead of @s 9 is eighter from 9x or 9xx|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: or perhaps 9 |pg||
nt|djneill: KQ tight is a bad holding, berry bad|pg||
nt|keylime:  I'm sure when dummy comes down Nagy will be happy to be playing in a low partial|pg||
nt|poohbear: Partner has not denied 4@ds yet|pg||
pc|h7|nt|poohbear: and has to be mildly worried that a @h lead might set 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: odds shift substantially if partner can have only 11 points, then 4 not safe|pg||
nt|poohbear: this is a coffee break hand now|pg||
nt|peachy: whoa!|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: Can't be from 9xx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is that allowed?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: S explains 2nt as too good for 3@h |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: yes according to cc it can|pg||
nt|othered1: It doesn't seem that west should be essaying state-of-the-match tactics at this point.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lesson here may be  4-small does not a help-suit game try make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and from the sensible side also|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dburn: 12 IMPs to Blakset on 7, where North chose to lead a club against 3NT - conveniently in dummy at trick one, declarer played a spade towards the queen at trick 2 and never knew he ...|pg||
nt|dburn: had a problem|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk4: sorry, this is against NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just looking at EW hands -- i'd be very happy to stop in 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looking at all 4 hands -- i'd be happy to stop in 3N|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzey: no problem Roland :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: with @s 6-2, I'm wondering if declarer might take an unusual line in hearts - lead 10 from hand|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: richman should either have returned a club or a heart, spades going no where|pg||
nt|djneill: South had a tough holding to lead from - all suits look bad to lead|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: and that should do it|pg||
pc|c4|nt|santyclz: Don't know about other countries, but in the usa there are highways with a minimum speed of 40 mph.|pg||
nt|jallerton: to pin 9x or 8x in East|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jallerton: playing for @CJ and/or @c10 in West|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW have plenty of time to take their @D trick to go with trump Ace and 2@C|pg||
nt|poohbear: now they play 9 x 16 boards RR|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|poohbear: but will carryover from each match they previously played|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 2@C was natural -- remember Peake could have had 4@H & 5+@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pause for questions or is Appleton trying to convince himself to lead his singleton?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: can Peake do anything other than win @S then @D from top?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|poohbear: so effectively 26 board matches|pg||
nt|poohbear: top 3 pairs become Australian team - 2 target events, the PABF (Zone 6) in Hamilton NZ and the Commonwealth Nations Cup in Delhi (just after Philadelphia)|pg||
nt|poohbear: the top 3 can choose whether to play 1 or both events|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D from top or start with Jack or 10?  [to delay finding discards]|pg||
nt|poohbear: this line is banking on the @d onside|pg||
nt|poohbear: perhaps better to try for a @c ruff in dummy?|pg||
nt|poohbear: but declarer was worried about potential @s ruff|pg||
nt|othered1: That would have been my choice|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s3|nt|vugraphzey: but even though I think its slow we are now halfway through this segment ... and they have only used half the time ... so thats ok :)|pg||

nt|mwigor: 6@h isnt the worst spot in the world|pg||
nt|mwigor: but probably down today|pg||
mb|1D|nt|santyclz: In the open room they got to 5@ds on the hand played so nicely here in 3nt.  It wasn't a success.|pg||
nt|othered1: @C lead would have been OK if north had selected the K|pg||
nt|frankaus: the top 3 pairs form the opem team to play at PABF (NZ) and Commonwealth Games (India) |pg||
nt|keylime:  I like six diamonds here but the split in diamonds sinks this without an enlightened guess.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=ART, 9-14, 4+@S, maybe longer @C/@D, NEG DBL => 4@S|pg||
nt|mwigor: EW will get to some number of @s quickly|pg||
nt|poohbear: the other room is starting up . I am moving there Ed|pg||
mb|d|nt|djneill: 6N appears to be correct since if @d don't break, might get 3@h, 3@d, 3@c and 3@s, while 6@d is very often just down on a bad break, right?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yikes, south giving hints|pg||
nt|djneill: I would not have suspected this Michaels, but N-S play limited openings, where North would open many 9's|pg||
nt|djneill: South is rather sure E-W have slam|pg||
nt|keylime:  That is waving a red flag to a bull I suspect|pg||
mb|3N|nt|frankaus: may be just the imfo to bring home 12|pg||
nt|mwigor: probably 3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other option was 2@S=5-9 5/6@S    but never PASS :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=3-8, 4+@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: still much to do in this match|pg||
nt|othered1: See  ya!|pg||
nt|othered1: I lilke the raise on 3 trumps, but it's no everyone's choice. |pg||
nt|zbig1959: .|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: Blakset bid 5@d on   6 in OR - and gave away a tenner|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i bet some ACOLites would open West hand 1@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: test spades first in 6NT|pg||
nt|frankaus: NS open most 8 counts|pg||
pc|h8|nt|othered1: This can be beaten off the top, of course|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then  1@C-1@H:2@S allows Robinson to describe his hand really well|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ah, so south already knew opponents likely to have slam|pg||
pc|h3|nt|peacokk: Interesting choice of bidding by Blakset|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: red vs white doesn't stop them from jumping early & often|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 790 a nice plus for lilley-nagy|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why not leave a decision to partner what to do after RD?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Gosney didn't have that problem  Tony Nunn opened SOUTH hand 3rd seat 1@D|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@d seems like the value bid here but he has to consider tht partner may respond a 3 card suit|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jbgood: looks as if all roads lead to Home|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@c said "I have opened light"|pg||
nt|jallerton: with an extra ace, South would pass|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes, but there can still be a penalty|pg||
nt|othered1: But game on 26 HCP is very normal and none seem to have a play.|pg||
nt|dburn: may be harder to beat off the bottom, as it were|pg||
nt|othered1: Hard to come up with a position (@HKQJxx, prehaps) where north must fly with the ace|pg||
nt|othered1: KQ9xx, rather|pg||
nt|djneill: so how would East count out this hand to guess the @d, frank?|pg||
nt|mwigor: this only has 3 losers|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jallerton: at the 1-level when partner can't open the bidding?  Unlikely!|pg||
nt|peachy: i think West is done, in this auction, so cant match|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jbgood: 4@h on for EW - not easy to bid.. and S makes 3 @s|pg||

nt|rodal f: Hi Ed and specs:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|santyclz: A play on "all Rhodes lead to Rome."|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|peachy: NS unwittingly (?) found a sac|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S is a good spot|pg||
nt|othered1: And it may be able to withstand a @Dmisguess|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it was pointed out to me that Robinson could NOT bid 1@C-1@H:2@S  -- that would be a splinter in support of @H|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@S shows 5/5 but peake may do it 4/5|pg||
nt|itinerant: hi rodal|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: 5@D looks like Exclusion Key Card   with 5@S showing 1 Key card, not counting @DA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice recovery|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|nt|mwigor: @dJ now for a ruffing finesse is best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lusk was in 4@S from East  -400|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 9 to play  Fleisher lead over Zimmermann down to 2|pg||
nt|itinerant: Are you not busy in the netherlands right now?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: Why did he Rdbl?|pg||
nt|jallerton: In case you had the opening values that your had bid suggested!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|othered1: Long hitch by east will made this easier in any case|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mwigor: without a double you almost certainly lose control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Peake can find 8 tricks  it should be a very good score|pg||
nt|mwigor: 8 will score ok|pg||
nt|mwigor: 9 will score very well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assume 4@H [not the non-making slam]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the best kind of save -- contract makes|pg||
nt|mwigor: i think he's just short|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H ruff, @C, @C ruff?  or save @C and just play @D after @H ruff?|pg||
nt|mwigor: @h ruff @d ruff high looks best double dummy|pg||
nt|mwigor: he might play @s to 9|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mrnye: can't go wrong now with the diamonds|pg||
nt|frankaus: nagy one of the best declarers in the country|pg||
nt|mrnye: very costly 2S bid|pg||
nt|keylime:  I think once North follows to the second heart here, it is an near open book in diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually can squeeze north now|pg||
nt|djneill: even a 5-0 break can make 4@d, 3@c, 3@h, 2@s|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s5|nt|poohbear: Declarer should draw 2 rounds of trump and play @s regardless of the trump break|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jbgood: now the defense gets a di trick - if he had played on clubs W would have to cash his @d ace to get it|pg||
nt|bjurn:  since 1@C wasnt natural W had a hard time finding a suitable forcing bid|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|itinerant: great lead from Neill to keep this to 9|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jallerton: 1@hx will make here on force of high cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right  small @D ruffed with J does look nice|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: Nagy duck of @CA has givein Delivera some timing problems|pg||
nt|mrnye: yeah i dont think he can quite make it. probably down 2 just before if defenders won ace of spades and played another spade|pg||
nt|mwigor: he had to dscard when reynolds didnt cover i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is interesting give and take|pg||
nt|mrnye: defence cannot afford to overruff here or declarer has control|pg||
nt|poohbear: so much for the @d guess|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: Appleton duck of @S looks wrong, @D AFTER playing a round of @S looks wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D pitch from Reynolds looks wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which double negative becomes the positive?|pg||
nt|mrnye: i cant see how bobby can avoid -500 here|pg||
nt|mwigor: i think he was ok if he pitched a @h from dummy after reynolds didnt cover the @d|pg||
nt|mwigor: for +730|pg||
nt|mwigor: perhaps reynolds did in fact cover|pg||
nt|mwigor: ok|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: it makes more sense that he did :)|pg||
nt|othered1: athere's the no sweat overtrick|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think Ian can make now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nunn led a @S, Hans ducked a @C, then 2 rounds of @H and @C|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mrnye: oops|pg||
mc|9|nt|kiwibridge: also making X'd|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not quite|pg||

nt|othered1: That was my thought, too|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Tough times for Konow right now .. lost 33 imps in just 3 boards|pg||
nt|frankaus: VWD - I had a greal confidence in zolly|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@c is still a Q bid|pg||
nt|poohbear: 1@c showed 2 I believe|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C after double should be a cue bid|pg||
nt|bjurn:  it said 11+ any |pg||
nt|ahollan1: very tough --- not sure how much of our pre @S lead analysis was result of seeing all hands :(|pg||
nt|mwigor: when they pass the double you sort of know trumps are 4-0|pg||
nt|itinerant: finally, a 3nt that makes, say Thomson/Brightling|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any like to use the BBO-TV: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  open one browser pr time.|pg||
nt|itinerant: some might not even muster a response with the west hand here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|frankaus: yes lose lips etc|pg||
nt|keylime:  really no reason to have spoken up there, and 17 imps the penalty for it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=11-14 HCP, if 4@H/@S 11-12|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: I still like their auction -- even if the contract went down|pg||
nt|othered1: West had stayed out of the auction and had great long @H, so maybe declarer can find @D.  |pg||
nt|itinerant: though when East opens 1S, that @sqj looks a little better|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jbgood: 3 NT seems a sensible contract|pg||
nt|peacokk: Yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: anyone for 1@s opening?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=Acol 2 or better|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: gin for 5@D here chance to score the beer card|pg||
nt|rodal f: If 2/1 EW will end at 2@S I belive|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: maybe that covers 8+ playing tricks in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: Nilsson..|pg||
nt|dburn: still, that was very good bridge by North|pg||
nt|othered1: More like @H and @S length|pg||
nt|itinerant: I think they play NF 1nt|pg||
nt|itinerant: voila|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: Easts Pass denies 3@hs|pg||
nt|jallerton: "denies" is clearly too strong|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: South was told so :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Right u was:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jallerton: maybe he wants to defend 2@cx|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: to be precise ... West told South "normally no 3-card @h" ... sr :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|poohbear: I would rebid 2@c again if able. systemically he might not be able. I hate rebidding 1NT with a small singleton in partners suit|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: on their card it says minimum of 0 but it looks like they open all balanced hands 1C...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C rebid presumably shows non minimum, but in that case i open 1@D if at all|pg||
nt|poohbear: 1@d opener shows 5|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzey: 1nt = 11-14|pg||
nt|othered1: some might double on south's hand, but result is likely the same|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C transfer positive?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh 7-9 HCP & 5+@D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@D should be unbalanced, so can be 45 minors (imo)|pg||
nt|poohbear: Gill's hand is worse than it looks|pg||
nt|poohbear: too much @h stuff|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|othered1: Low@S is the winner here and east found it.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|djneill: East has no reason to think he will get doubled, and no reason to think 9 tricks will make exactly|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would definitely lead a @c too|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5 card suit and 2 sure entries|pg||
nt|poohbear: rates to be duplicated values|pg||
nt|othered1: right.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|peacokk: Looks like +1 to me, 4@H, 1@S, 1@D, 4@C|pg||
nt|djneill: so why not bid 4|pg||
nt|frankaus: the last hand will reach a bridge magazine or 2 i expect|pg||
nt|keylime:  Wouldn't be surprised if it became a Test Your Play problem|pg||
nt|fabsayc: peake has not really shown this strong a playing hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: good start for the defense|pg||
nt|poohbear: this should hold declarer to 8|pg||
nt|othered1: I think the auction says trumps,e ven before you look at your cards|pg||
nt|poohbear: can take 2@d ruffs AK @c and 4 trumps in dummy|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer will try to pitch @s and set up the long @d but I think he gets tapped out first|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jallerton: If West bid 2@d instead of 3@C, that would be non-forcing for many pairs|pg||
nt|itinerant: hard to see a 7th trick for declarer here|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the CC only talks about the 2@D/@H/@S responses   2@D include negative AND all 10+ HCP|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|djneill: wow, sold to 4@c in other room, but different auction |pg||
nt|fabsayc: can give up on trump hook now|pg||
nt|frankaus: X and bid is a GOSH here, (G)reat (O)ne (S)uited (H)and|pg||
nt|itinerant: 4 spades and 2 hearts might be the limit|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ian thinking    FINALLY a helpful lead!|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kiwibridge: hope he claimed the beer|pg||
nt|peachy: lets campaign to get it in regulation, extra points for beer:)|pg||
nt|othered1: trump lead doesn't seem to leave declarer any good play|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jbgood: but alternatives are not attractive|pg||
pc|c4|nt|santyclz: 1@s in most partnerships, 2@d in 1.|pg||
nt|rodal f: E need to drop a @C from JX if NS make a perfect defence, for make 7 tr|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|peacokk: +2 now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugrapha4: very hard with reynolds because he covers his played cards with his hands.|pg||
nt|othered1: Up ace in case south had @D J |pg||
pc|d3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|poohbear: defense could have gone wrong by playing 4 rounds of @s|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c8|nt|poohbear: now a @d most likely. Everyone should know declarer's shape by now|pg||
nt|poohbear: Ebery might lead a sneaky 3 of @ds|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rodal f: Or. I was wrong:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Only one card E can't play. @C3|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|poohbear: best he can do is try to drop the @d king tripleton but thats impossible on the auction|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|poohbear: he basically concedes down 1|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|vugrapha4: Richman claimed|pg||
nt|djneill: in the states it is very common in 5M systems to play 1M-(X)-2M as a weak raise (and something else as a normal raise) here that would get E-W to 4@h but then South would likely ...|pg||

mb|2D|nt|fabsayc: still he could have made hand|pg||
nt|itinerant: ye olde weak two in diamonds!|pg||
mb|d|nt|peacokk: Very aggressive 3@C opening|pg||
nt|othered1: More potential action|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: it is the last segment of the semifinals -- and there are plenty of interesting boards :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice shift from Lilley for the imp|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he claimed it :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: Neill and I have different approaches to bidding. I woulda passed the TO dbl|pg||
nt|itinerant: Neill and Kanetkar play a blindingly simple system - and they play it well!|pg||
nt|itinerant: not sure if fit-showing jumps are in their repertoire|pg||
nt|itinerant: else, 3H from neill looks to be a good bid|pg||
nt|ardek: not after the double, I'd hope|pg||
nt|itinerant: Hi Ron!|pg||
nt|ardek: or even without it opposite a weak two|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Ron and welcomed u are:)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: not quite the 5@S 5@C hand we saw a few boards ago|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=9-14, 4+@S, maybe longer @C/@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can E avoid the X|pg||
nt|itinerant: slowly slowly, says Bruce Neill|pg||
nt|rodal f: Top spot reached.|pg||
nt|ardek: :) tx|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: how many boards played at your table ?|pg||
nt|itinerant: 17-26|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@S -1 I presume and by a X it make 100 so a =|pg||
mb|3S|nt|poohbear: Black suit lead would beat 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: and a nonaggressive pass by N..|pg||
nt|jallerton: downgrading his side queens.  Many would open 1@H on that West hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is where the old ACOL approach of 1@C then @S @S works much better [imo]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=TRF @H, good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure how that differs from 1@H-2@H = NAT, 6-10|pg||
nt|peachy: If E had used Michaels (if they have it here), he might be entitled to pull, but in this auction, he is cooked and pass|pg||
mb|4S|nt|poohbear: Gosney trating his hand as too good to overcall 1H|pg||
nt|poohbear: treating|pg||
nt|mwigor: 2@h would be a weaker raise to 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|peacokk: They've talked about this surely|pg||
nt|mwigor: sorry 1@h showed @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh now i know -- i translated wrong from CC   2@D & 2@H both transfers|pg||
nt|mwigor: i'll wake up now|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: I would just bid 2@h not 2@c|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can Nunn now match the doubled over :)|pg||
nt|peachy: not too hard to do, but also not unreasonable to just take 10|pg||
nt|poohbear: I suspect that 2@s by Gosney merely shows a 4th @s and not much extra|pg||
nt|othered1: That's an area where there is little uniformity in styles|pg||
nt|itinerant: Brightling has been known to pass in moments like these|pg||
mb|p|nt|ardek: won't be doubled|pg||
pc|h8|nt|frankaus: zolly will make this i predict|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe north's double replaces @S bid, so south simply raised|pg||
pc|h9|nt|fabsayc: 2@C is doubious|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jallerton: interesting opening lead.|pg||
nt|othered1: This may not play very well|pg||
nt|othered1: Is it double-dummy to ruff and lead low @C?  That will make as cards lie, I think|pg||
nt|xenya: suppose declarer ruffs and plays a small club |pg||
nt|xenya: yes, on the surface, there are only 3 losers -- 2 trumps and a club |pg||
nt|ardek: Brightling wishes he had passed . . .|pg||
pc|h3|nt|poohbear: this is likely down 2 on a @c lead. Cant see any reason for S not to lead one|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: so he just needs to retain control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: who gets the charge?   Delivera DBL far from automatic   Robinson 4@C very agressive   Delivera 4@S -- can he fathom to PASS 4@C?|pg||
nt|ardek: nicely done|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mwigor: i'd prefer to bid 1@s the first time with appleton's hand - but obviously their agreements dont allow that|pg||
nt|peachy: Actually, 11 might be coming automatically when he takes club finesse|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jbgood: anyone for 1 NT on the E hand?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: if he does not, we will ask for undo|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mwigor: it looks like he has just turned a plus (against 3@h) into a minus|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless that is conventional showing something like Michaels |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jbgood: direct?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Nilsson .....  just told Fredin that he think he made a mistake not bidding 1nt :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: or for N to shift to @s|pg||
nt|ardek: South ignores the suit-preference H2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mwigor: 2@s should be Michaels|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mwigor: 1@s should be natural (imho)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: keyword = "should" |pg||
nt|mwigor: and imho (in my humble opinion)|pg||
nt|mwigor: others would (and clearly do) think differently|pg||
nt|mrnye: I'm with you michael|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Michael how do you play DBL?   takeout of @S or   showing @H?   |pg||
nt|mwigor: take-out of @s|pg||
nt|mrnye: especially since you know how to play the trump suit|pg||
nt|mwigor: 2@h shows @h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: gotcha|pg||
nt|mrnye: partner puts down xx spade and you'll finesse the QJxx offside easily :)|pg||
nt|mrnye: *onside|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that all makes sense to me too|pg||
nt|poohbear: Defense will get 4 trump tricks here|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mwigor: but then again these guys made stage 2 of the playoff and i didnt make stage 1|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think a low @h was played |pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: that's why I voted for 1@C opener -- if partnership allows|pg||
nt|ahollan1: more cost efficient our way Michael|pg||
pc|sK|nt|poohbear: not the king|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|jbgood: :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: Would you have doubled 3@h on the North hand?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|dburn: not sure whether he could have made it, but fairly sure he now can't - credit to Christiansen for not jumping to 4@s (as I confess I would have done)|pg||
nt|othered1: 45-0 run is pretty hard to counter.|pg||
nt|itinerant: due to the club blockage, perhaps he should not have ignored it|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: not very often the contract 1@s occurs twice in a row :)|pg||

nt|poohbear: 3@h is my choice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hey -- don't blame USA      it's ACBL|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: they keyword is "ladies" who are just smarter IMHO :)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|jbgood: margin down to 7 imps now..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: passed...|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 1@s = at least a 5-card suit :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: I think it's very close - I'm sure I would if partner not a passed hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: rather funny distributions - or? 7 or 8-cards suits en masse!|pg||
nt|keylime:  one more big score and I'd ask for a declaration....|pg||
nt|poohbear: and Gill has a tuff decision|pg||
nt|mwigor: this event is played under different regs to most ABF events i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so not allowed in Canada, Mexico or Bermuda either|pg||
nt|mwigor: i think the keyword is americans ally - although i dont necessarily disagree with you on your main point|pg||
nt|rodal f: A coffe board came. brb|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jallerton: even a club lead does not beat slam, as the hand with @sA does not have another club|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2nt = invitational + .. at least 4@h|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would dbl as well|pg||
nt|itinerant: heh - "a coffee board" - where you're better to fill up your caffeine drip than to watch the game?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: but this time the brakes were too good:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 1@s is Walsh ... might have longer @d suit|pg||
nt|jbgood: easy to remember to alert when you actually have a longer @d suit - easy to forget if not:)|pg||
nt|othered1: Right, a lucky grand can generate action|pg||
nt|dburn: but this Danish version of the dealing program may be worth exporting - just been watching a bunch of part scores in the Camrose, so this is a change for the better|pg||
nt|mrnye: the richman-peake system certainly creates swings but they are often on the right side of the swing.|pg||
nt|poohbear: @s suit not good enuff for 3 level overcall|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=9+HCP, 3@H  or   8-9 HCP, 4@H|pg||
nt|poohbear: Kanetkar will need to find a @d lead to beat 5 @s|pg||
nt|poohbear: I suspect Gos is bidding|pg||
nt|othered1: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: S will raise|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzey: Now W alerted 4@d --- South hasnt asked --- but at first W didnt alert now he has|pg||
nt|mrnye: it's just something you have to live with when you play these sort of methods - you WILL get some bad results from the system|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 3 @d looks like a minisplinter - and now Søren has some extras for his bid..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I use 2nt different. 2nt is not only inviting , contains also some defensive values|pg||
nt|ahollan1: The New Zealand Trials were held this weekend   Final Results   1) Reid-Newell  2) Grant-Ker   [both fun systems to watch]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hand not good enough for double :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: this wont work out too well|pg||
nt|othered1: distribution could be wilder than this|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|itinerant: 10tks methinks|pg||
nt|itinerant: GIB thinks the same, that's good|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jallerton: the auction has not tempoed well for EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I guess 4@d is cue with @s ... but havent been told yet because South hasnt asked about the bidding yet ... but I'll be back :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: win and play small @H DUCKING|pg||
nt|poohbear: this will be down 1 or 2 depending on how declarer plays @ds|pg||
nt|othered1: i.e., this could be a 2-way game swing|pg||
nt|poohbear: In theory Gos made the correct decision . In practice I dont think so|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 @s is what makes|pg||
nt|jbgood: Fredin keeps underleading red aces|pg||
nt|jallerton: South knows that someone is probably void in hearts, so sensibly tries the unbid suit|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure whether 4@h is "last train" or a psychic cue bid, but still all outcomes possible|pg||
nt|peachy: I will need to say good night, past midnight here.  Thanks Gary for having me here, and thanks kibitzers for your comments!!!!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx Raija for coming in much appreciated :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Nunn in the tank?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|poohbear: 3@s may or may not make. If that is what Gill had bid the likely contract would have been 3@s or 3NT depending on Gosney's mood|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like it'll be approximately a push.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|frankaus: plase remember the scoring is V a mean datum of the middle 3 scores from 5 tables  - the score we see is not what the players will end with|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Nunn passes reluctantly|pg||
nt|itinerant: So, Thomsom-Brightling are very much in contention with 1 match to play after this.|pg||
mc|11|nt|ralfwil: What´s your opinion Jeffrey, about 2nt inviting? like here or as I play with defensive values (top honours)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure how they choose the 3rd pair for the upcoming NZ hosted PABF|pg||
nt|poohbear: no defense against the minors and partner's " defense" concentrated in the majors|pg||
nt|itinerant: Neill-Kanetkar have not had their best-ever tournament|pg||
nt|itinerant: they need a mathematical miracle to qualify|pg||

mb|1C!|an|2+|mb|2S!|nt|poohbear: Adam " Plum " Meredith used to open 3 card majors regardless of system :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@D opener was an option and would have worked much better|pg||

nt|jbgood: a boring 4@h - coffee time|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: now a short break -- toilet |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 1-2 minutes |pg||
nt|jallerton: I think there are plenty of ways to raise partner through cue bids, so 2NT is better used as natural|pg||
nt|jallerton: each partnership can work out for itself what 2@C, 3@C, 2@s, 3@H should mean|pg||
nt|jallerton: most important to be on the same wavelength though|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3 of 4 is back -- waiting for Søren|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: here we go again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both in evaluation of the hand [8 losers] and the play  -- but bet Delivera would like his @C9 back|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Richman taking a break|pg||
nt|frankaus: tkx Fiona|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense surely had 8 tricks|pg||
nt|kareno: Then it would be down 5 as declarer could not duck anything.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|djneill: that last hand was what the 4crd majorites love to raise to game on - hoping the opponents will sacrifice|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodal f: They played realy vell at the last one.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|poohbear: declarer must have misguessed @ds for down 2|pg||
nt|othered1: So, if we were making up a charge sheet, we'd have to know what that pass by south meant first.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: a good spade raise?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@h = 3card support and to good for just 2@s |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I guess the convention is called Ostot|pg||
nt|jallerton: I'm a little surprised North didn't open|pg||
nt|jallerton: he can double now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ACOL 2@D before 1@S  ----   there is a large number of 2/1 players who would bid 1@S  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: some will only bypass 4-card @S with 2 more in minor, others NEVER bypass @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I think it is easier to understand 1@S if playing relays, otherwise i'm not convinced [yet]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D    probably not good enough for splinter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially since 2@D not automatic game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 6 to play  Zimmermann 104  Fleisher 88|pg||
nt|djneill: frank does Australia ever borrow gadgets from other parts of the world, I don't see a lot of evidence for it|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@c is 6-9 with 4 card support|pg||
nt|poohbear: bergen raise|pg||
nt|itinerant: the top 3 pairs after the next round will become the Australian Open Team for 2010 - is that right, Ron?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: Richman submarine openers getting weaker and weaker|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless Reynolds opened 1@H :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: In my partnership it was forcing|pg||
nt|othered1: Not mine, though maybe it should be.|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: lots of good stuff comes here from NZ|pg||
nt|mwigor: what was 2@d al?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think South opened 1@H and 2@D same as last hand|pg||
nt|mwigor: ah that makes more sense|pg||
nt|rodal f: And slam lost|pg||
mb|6D|nt|ahollan1: :) :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Agree jeffrey1 For me a clear opening on N! but if Ps bid is 3@d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d = 14-16 med 5+@h og 4+@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2nt = at least values to game|pg||
nt|poohbear: was 10 tricks there I believe Catherine|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nope.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrnye: gill-gosney play a system that you are probably more familiar with in the USA - the Sydney players tend to play more modern methods than the rest of the country|pg||
nt|poohbear: I dont like the 4@s bid. I would make a trial 3@d bid|pg||
nt|kareno: So both souths made the Bergen raise and both norths accepted.  It's hard to judge but 5/5 is a useful pattern.|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: 2@d not transfer |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d is "stayman-like" according to conventioncard|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@s = single @s and maximum|pg||
nt|xenya: well. this may be another chance for Konow -- the dealer is really generous|pg||
nt|djneill: ok nick fahrer, owner of the Bridge Shop, says they play transfer responses to standard @c more often now than before, which is starting to take hold among the top standard players ...|pg||
nt|djneill: everywhere|pg||
nt|keylime:  2@s goes down on a spade lead and continuation comfortably|pg||
nt|fabsayc: down 3 maybe four|pg||
nt|frankaus: i predict - Little Old Ladies will be playing transfer responses in 10 years |pg||
nt|keylime:  I suspect even the ACBL within a few years will allow xfer responses to a standard 1@c|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they already do Dwayne|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ally's sense of humor -- putting commentators on the spot more than we can do ourselves|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe more practical to have them make an occasionally doubled contract in order to get the extra auctions a forcing pass would provide.|pg||
nt|poohbear: We will unofficially go with 10 tricks for the audience|pg||
nt|itinerant: yummy spot, this|pg||
nt|itinerant: no drama setting up the hearts as  the 2nd round cannot be over-ruffed|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jallerton: You have to pass.  Opposite a passed hand double 2NT should be scramble|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3NT is interesting opposite a passed hand.  |pg||
nt|poohbear: this does have the advantage of concealment|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jbgood: losing 2 clubs - next!|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 4nt = natural !!!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, what 6 makes game good|pg||
nt|poohbear: of course concealment doesnt help much when the defense has in effect 4 aces|pg||
pc|s5|nt|santyclz: Good bid.  Don't tell the opps anything you don't have to.|pg||
nt|frankaus: i think that they are clearly superior to current methods|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jbgood: game going Stayman |pg||
nt|jallerton: though the @s blockage hinders EW a little|pg||
nt|ralfwil: S has to rely on @c 2-2 - or?|pg||
nt|jallerton: but does he need to knock out @dA first (a card East is likely to have)? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so  2@D=9+HCP, 3@H  or   8-9 HCP, 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: presumably 2N-3@D clarifies|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: (Appleton gave me the abridged version)|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@h would not be everyons choice but it sure worked here|pg||
nt|othered1: I like 3@H, but it's pretty aggressive since south doesn't guarantee 4@H (see @S suit)|pg||
nt|poohbear: Game is just a tad worse than a @h finesse|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dburn: diamonds? what diamonds?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 5@s = accept slam - showing 2 aces and @hQ|pg||
nt|othered1: did they ever bid @D naturally?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d showed 14-16 hcp and 5+@h and 4+@d|pg||
nt|othered1: ty|pg||
nt|mwigor: 9 easy tricks and a @s ruff for 10?|pg||
nt|mwigor: probably an 11th there if you work at it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems like a non-specific piece of information to gain rather than a long suit [@S] or short suit [@C] game try, but I don't know the system beyond the CC|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: they bar my multi but have played them in ACBL events for four years now|pg||
nt|poohbear: Gold would have an easy decline with his pile of trash. ( despite the " 8" points)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Foe shure the bid wasn't sient made:)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|keylime:  I thought that was still Mid-Chart Martin?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe but not enforced in this area|pg||
nt|fabsayc: transfer advances were made legal some years ago in competition|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|poohbear: wow is that the lead?|pg||
nt|othered1: That's one way to give declarer a problem in trumps|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jallerton: or at least slip through 1@D trick|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kareno: I like Barry's suggestion of 3@d as a game try.  At the other table their version did not allow for it.|pg||
nt|poohbear: here we see the value of concealment|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, hello!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bergen simply preempts partner if you don't do game tries|pg||
nt|poohbear: Gosney wanted to set up a @c trick in case declarer had Qx in @h  and Gill thought his partner was angling for a ruff|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 30 minute warning|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||

nt|rodal f: Safe by 3-1@D and 3-2@H now.|pg||
mc|12|nt|jallerton: he's blocked the @s suit.  Sadly...|pg||

nt|othered1: Descriptive,  IN my style, 1N doesn't promise anything more than an initial response.|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3NT would go down on 4th best @h lead|pg||
nt|poohbear: or one high one one low one|pg||
nt|othered1: Another auction that says lead trumps|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|poohbear: They open VERY light|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: restart is in about 10minutes after this round finishes|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|djneill: may ruff the @c just to cash the @dA|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|henryb:  good morning|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi |pg||
nt|peacokk: hey|pg||
nt|jbgood: a surprise 9 imps on   8 when NS in the CR chose to play @d on 3-2 rather than @h on 5-4|pg||
nt|jbgood: a "slight" misunderstanding ending in a cue...|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: @s 5 or @d 2 seems to be under consideration|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: and now @c 4 too :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: low club was better but west found the play anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this set ends with board 16|pg||
pc|h8|nt|poohbear: but here he knows that partner is unbalanced as well|pg||
pc|d7|nt|othered1: That's a winning track play.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mrnye: ruffing the club gives east another trump trick|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 13 minutes left|pg||
nt|mrnye: so probably down 2 now|pg||
nt|mrnye: declarer does best now to start on spades|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzey: if @h are not 3-3 can he win it then?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: he might play "safe" to get 4 @h tricks .. but thats not enough ... is it?|pg||
nt|othered1: not with the @C marked in south|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the price you pay for light openers|pg||
nt|itinerant: he looks to have escaped for -1|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|xenya: well he can try a @D to the Q now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ralfwil: inte bra!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|othered1: the 10 is a really interesting play.|pg||
nt|xenya: if it wins, he can duck a @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: now he is forced to play for @h 3-3 .... but I cant tell him that it works and we can go to the next board |pg||
nt|itinerant: 2 trumps and a club to lose if he guesses clubs correctly|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ralfwil: sry private|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jallerton: North might have exploed more with 4@c, but it would lead to the same contract|pg||
nt|othered1: When is the @D10 right and why was that indicated here? |pg||
pc|h6|nt|poohbear: I think he fell off the track|pg||
nt|poohbear: needed to play a second trump and then a @s|pg||
nt|othered1: I think he's still OK|pg||
nt|poohbear: he is going to run into a @h uppercut if one gets pitched here|pg||
nt|othered1: or does @H pitch work out for defense?|pg||
nt|poohbear: He had to play for the mortons fork in @s|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both women's tables in 4@H, both Open in 6@H|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s5|nt|jallerton: *explored|pg||

nt|dburn: you might as well play it as opposed to the six - who knows what might happen?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not to mention all the voluntary minus results when partner is weak|pg||
nt|itinerant: the heart duck brought declarer to 7 tricks and the 3rd diamond allowed him to catch the trumps|pg||
nt|itinerant: for 8|pg||
nt|itinerant: ... it's been a long tournament and i'm sure the players are starting to feel the pinch - Bruce Neill is never that kind to me at the table!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if there is a @D lead that could stop West from cashing @DA before playing the 1st @C|pg||
nt|itinerant: how is beautiful Montpellier, henri?|pg||

nt|ritong: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: don't worry about running score anyway  this trials is PAIR event -- just setup on BBO to have some other result to look at|pg||
nt|mwigor: assuming they're dropping top and bottom datum on 14 will be 650 so thats 8 IMPs to peake-richman|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=STR with @D|pg||
nt|rodal f: A easy one anyhow at 4@S. Not for 5 if u change NS cards|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: wow, what a method|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: where are all the aussie commentators asks the poor Kiwi?|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|vugraphzey: 2@h is weak @h support from South .... 2@d would have been a good @h support|pg||
nt|jallerton: East has a decision to make now.  3@C?  3@S?  Force to game with 3@h?|pg||
nt|mwigor: the transfer jump shift or the selection method?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: both :)|pg||
nt|ritong: why would we change diagrams:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  now 3@d as a game try by N?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d is a kind of "reversed Drury" ... 2@d shows that W has an opening hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: N awaits a high ! contract ..|pg||
nt|jbgood: @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@c is a kind of "reversed Drury" ... 2@d shows that W has an opening hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Robinson 1@C=4+|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: first time i've seen [or heard] of this treatment|pg||
nt|mwigor: the abf seems to feel it needs to come up with a new method each year - so they come up with some unusual ones|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: is this the final countdown|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: lead is @c J|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: another chance lost -- 3N by W would have probably made|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 3 @h is by most players just a fight - strange action by N|pg||
nt|jallerton: With West haveing a light opening bid (Fredin passed in the other room) the low road works well|pg||
nt|fabsayc: australian bridge players invent new conventions every hour, hard to keep up :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks Ally on the vugraph and thx specs for your feedback|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx to the ABF and BBO for putting this on|pg||
nt|itinerant: It's nice to see someone raise with the west hand!|pg||
nt|itinerant: it seems the support xx is all the rage with the kids these days|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still it use to be home at 5 there too byt the @D test if NS made it.|pg||
nt|ritong: redouble has some kind of fascination to a number of players|pg||
nt|ritong: not only kids:)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|othered1: Wrong-sided as the cards lie.  But somehow 2N with that @H holding deserves some punishment, if not the obvious one.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|babs59: It's actually in even years that the ABF runs a Pair based selection.  In odd years (Bermuda Bowl) there is a Team based selection|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least half of those Australians are ex-pat Kiwi's :)|pg||
nt|mwigor: this is true - but the format of each changes regularly|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their 2N opener is @C & @D -- i wonder how they handle the various 20+ balanced hands|pg||
nt|poohbear: Highly aggressive by West|pg||
nt|itinerant: You are young at heart, dear Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: but you re right, it shows some youthful spirit|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzey: seems like we have to congratulate Lars Blakset - Jakob Røn, Håkan Nilsson - Peter Fredin and Mathias Bruun - Knut Blakset with a place in the final|pg||
nt|xenya: however a few spectators point out it can still be made on a squeeze|pg||

nt|poohbear: faaaaaaast|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|babs59: I quite like this year's version - with the carryover from Stage 1 - those 10 boards count in this match, effectively making each set a 26 board match|pg||

nt|mrnye: at the other table south doubled 3H for the lead which leads to 9 tricks only because the heart can't get discarded in time on the clubs|pg||
nt|djneill: doubling an artificial bid for the lead when partner is going to be on lead is a great idea I think|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: last board here and it's Catherine on the vugraph we have to thank today @H|pg||
nt|poohbear: excellent 6NT here|pg||
nt|poohbear: need to figure out the @ds and the @ss to bid it though|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|Walddk11: Draining but it's fun|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 4@h = pass if @h is your suit or correct to 4@s if thats your suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice fit by the 19HP total at EW.|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I think it is better to use the intermediate step as the (artificial) game try, and double as a suggestion of penalty|pg||
nt|peacokk: Isn't it as playing with a junior - every game-try is a way to game|pg||
nt|kareno: We played comic NT in Paris in the sixties.  Don't often see it now.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|poohbear: very popular in Australia|pg||
nt|poohbear: as we can see. EW were prepared|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if 1NT not alerted 2@C would either be non-forcing or majors for most north americans|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Peter deep in thought|pg||
nt|poohbear: What itme is the next session Fee?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 2:30|pg||
nt|kareno: Problem is south doesn't know north's suit and can't push them around with it.|pg||
nt|poohbear: so next session is in a little over an hour from now|pg||
nt|kareno: And how long until 2:30?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: sigh, why not bid naturally|pg||
nt|othered1: West hand can be tough to rebid if you show a solid suit when you jump over a 2/1.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: Do you have time for dinner, Jan?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2NT relay|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: If you know my weight you wouldnt be asking ... I look like one who ALWAYS have time for dinner :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: and today is no exception .... I promise :)|pg||
nt|ritong: south does not intend to give up on the last board|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: I guess 2NT showed significant extras but he does have a good 6 card suit and 18 prime points|pg||
nt|itinerant: It's Christmas, says Thomson|pg||
nt|rodal f: If they have the score u mean Henri?|pg||
nt|ritong: esp with the indicated trump lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzey: 3@h is transfer|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@s shows 3-card @s .. with only two North would bid 3nt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now he has eliminated all blackwood bids|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@c seems very dangerous|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@h|pg||
nt|ritong: ..|pg||
nt|itinerant: curious choice of lead|pg||
pc|s4|nt|henryb:  that is a brave balance|pg||
nt|jbgood: Difficult for Konow to win this board - but may get a push|pg||
nt|mrnye: I dont like the 1nt bid by andrew here|pg||
nt|mrnye: opposite a favourable 1S overcall you are just asking for trouble|pg||
nt|mrnye: richman could be overcalling many 6-7 counts here|pg||
nt|poohbear: not sure what Gill means by it|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@h was bizarre.  Was it meant as a transfer? cuebid?  Why not bid his second suit?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all pass is possible|pg||
nt|poohbear: I can ask his sister . She is in the audience and an Australian internationalist .|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: was 1nt perhaps alerted as hearts, else this is insane|pg||
nt|othered1: This is also an example of a good hand for a big club system.|pg||
nt|poohbear: aaaaah ok|pg||
nt|poohbear: this makes more sense|pg||
nt|poohbear: but still . I feel West hasnt done Justice to this hand|pg||

nt|Walddk11: Pharmaservice by 4 IMPs with 4 comparisons to come in the other semi-final|pg||
nt|Walddk11: Two very tight semi-finals|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Tomorrow we start at 9am -- looking forward to seeing you all then :) |pg||
nt|Walddk11: And the bridge has been very good most of the time|pg||
nt|othered1: With lots of exciting hands and, accordingly, chances to misjudge things.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Sghe says this is why she has played with Peter once in the last 30 years :) ( OK just me kidding :))|pg||
nt|ahollan1: friendly lie for declarer|pg||
nt|othered1: He never let partner evaluate his @SQ in terms of tricks to take|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|mrnye: 1nt should show 11-13 or so in this sort of auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  TRF = Transfer|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jallerton: a play problem to end with then|pg||
nt|poohbear: Perhaps a 4@s bid ( having bid 2NT) would better serve his purpose. That has to be a 6 card suit and 18-19 otherwise why the 2NT bid?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jallerton: still.  South has to lead something|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: if this wins the match is all square|pg||

nt|ritong: well, a void is a void|pg||
nt|itinerant: he doesn't want to blow a trick with that @h65|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|jallerton: he can now count 12 tricks if @s are 2-2, but can he make it on 3-1 spades?|pg||

nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not any more however|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jbgood: and the balance was not found at the other table|pg||
nt|djneill: the @h situation is probably marked here - East showed 4, and West let the @hK, unlikely West would lead from a doubleton King knowing the opponents had 7 of them, unless it was KQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not that clear from lead, but is strange defense if nagy has the queen|pg||
nt|keylime:  I duck because I really have no compelling reason to cover here|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jbgood: bye all - see you in an hour or so for the next 16|pg||

nt|ritong: might be|pg||
nt|itinerant: fair enough too - they've been playing bridge for more than 4 hours!|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzey: if the match ends "all square" after the last 16 boards tonight, then Konow will earn a place in tomorrows final |pg||

nt|ritong: they better be able to hang on for ten hours a day two weeks long if they want to represent their country|pg||
pc|c7|nt|othered1: Right.  In a tight partnership, you'll have discussed this stuff, perhaps this hand specifically|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mrnye: east may find the play with QTxx though since he knows south has two good diamonds and that the heart is his only possible entry|pg||
nt|itinerant: hmmm|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ritong: especially if their coach considers them as an anchor pair|pg||
nt|itinerant: methinks a diamond pitch was a better idea, but declarer was not to know that the defence's trumps were KJT9 and 65 specifically|pg||
