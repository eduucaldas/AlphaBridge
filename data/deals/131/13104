mb|1N|mb|2S|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|dburn: good morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: The French were very active bidders when I watched them yesterday.|pg||
nt|kareno: David :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|kareno: I guess it's very early morning for you, David|pg||
nt|kareno: This won't be a success.|pg||
nt|dburn: about 3 am|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kareno: No daylight savings time?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cK|nt|dburn: it won't, and I am not quite sure what motivated Krekorian to bid it|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: the score perhaps|pg||
nt|kareno: He just got into the spirit of things.  I think pass was indicated.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bjacobs: And it was something of a murky auction.  I guess he hoped partner had an extra 3 points or so|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|kareno: My feeling about such scores is that you play your normal game and keep track of swings.  |pg||
nt|dburn: we in England will not save as much daylight as you in America do until the end of March|pg||
nt|kareno: Ah, ours did start early.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|c7|pc|h9|pg||
nt|kareno: It is, after all, a difference of five swings over 32 boards, not impossible and not necessary to come out swinging, especially on a NV board where there is less of a game bonus.|pg||

mb|1N|nt|dinos1: Cornelia :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dinos1: with soft values and strong short suits better not ask majors|pg||
nt|chick: 9 tricks available after knocking out a couple of aces, and NS have no long suit to set up|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rodal f: Hi Cam and specs|pg||
nt|gambit: One might expect N/S to swing a little, down by 50....maybe we will see some fireworks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness explaining their methods: open lowest with more than 1 4-card suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: hi everyone|pg||
nt|chick: HI John :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: hi John|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: caught up now.  board 1 is always chaos|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dinos1: 3@h and 2x3 tricks|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|dinos1: now low @d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sadek finally turns the trick, still thinking|pg||
nt|gambit: I was on VuG last night when E/W played very well and knocked off the  1 seed Nickel, they are very tough |pg||

nt|dburn: well, collecting that third heart may be problematic|pg||
nt|dinos1: dcl may set @d now|pg||
nt|chick: now that he used up his @D entry, will have to play on diamonds instead|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Let's hope they don't compensate here, where there is a very thin vul game to be had|pg||
nt|bjacobs: non-vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Vulnerable is a different story.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Well there was a small but important difference in the two auctions|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In the CR, North bid 3@D ... this meant that East's 3@H was voluntary rather than forced|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And that colors West's thinking|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|kareno: Yes, that free bid of 3@h over 3@d showed values Casen didn't know about in the east hand.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|kareno: So Thomas Bessis wins a swing by passing - a useful lesson.|pg||
nt|dburn: not clear that 2NT is the right idea with the West cards - would prefer 1@h to see if partner can raise|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bjacobs: I think this was mostly luck.  One can hardly criticize either Pass or 3@D from North - they are not to know how it will work out|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kareno: I use the unusual notrump (or Michaels) only with weak or quite strong hands.  With normal opening bids, I just overcall.|pg||
nt|dburn: but I guess that West was anxious to show his suits before the opponents started bidding spades|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You can't realistically think to yourself: "if I bid 3@D, that will make East's 3@H voluntary, so I better pass"|pg||
nt|kareno: North knows he can't really compete at the vulnerability, however.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Maybe a show of strength might inhibit the opponents.  Or maybe it won't inhibit them but 4@H goes down.  You just cannot know|pg||
nt|dburn: of course not - at the other table South's 1@d happened to show diamonds, so North raised diamonds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Wasn't 1@D natural here?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d5|pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
nt|dburn: at this one, 1@d might have been three diamonds only, so there was no question of North's raising|pg||
nt|kareno: I believe it is natural.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: EW defensive carding is standard count but upside-down attitude|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: halftime: fleisher 142-diamond 42, de kniff 111-zaleski 56|pg||
mb|1D|nt|dburn: seemed better to pitch a club on the third heart, then play a spade|pg||
mb|2N|nt|dinos1: better to play @s to J and set 5th @d|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thxto Wayne:) Here u are the score after segment 2: http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2010/01/vanderbilt/|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: strul 151-lynch 51, and zimmermann 96-onstott 41|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: er, strul 131-lynch 51|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|gambit: Huge lead for Strul, hopefully this match will become a little closer, adds to the flavour |pg||
mb|4H|nt|dinos1: 100% line coz def didnt lead @c to that moment|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: this is a fair slam, but again the play is not straightforward|pg||
nt|dburn: and nor is the bidding - not quite sure what Passell intends here|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: no doubt 4@d is Blackwood for clubs, but...|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@d was? @crkcb?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: I will forward any explanations I can read or overhear|pg||
nt|dburn: ...that seems a little odd with no control in either of the unbid suits|pg||
nt|chick: I'm told by a spec that it is a transfer to hearts, not sure if that is true or not :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: NS play 1@C could be 2 if 4432, so 1@D is always real diamonds|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dburn: well, North will be confident at this point|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: twas passell thinking there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness quits fidgeting with his pencil and leans over the table to examine dummy|pg||
nt|gambit: the lead looks terrifying from W perspective|pg||
pc|dT|nt|dburn: whether confident enough to double, we will discover|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
nt|dinos1: 1@c was strong so ...|pg||
nt|stewball: attack|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|warrens:  Becker's too wise to double.  if they ran, his partner would have to guess what suit to lead against 7@C|pg||
nt|stewball: very curious|pg||
nt|dburn: he cannot be sure of beating 7@c, so he will probably let it go|pg||
nt|dinos1: if dbl 6N then 7@c by E and what to lead? :)|pg||

nt|kareno: How easily?  Only with 4-4-3-2?  After the overcall it is unlikely south has that distribution.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|kareno: The Bergen raise in the CR put a tough decision to east, just as this weaker raise has done here.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|dburn: but it seems also to have put a tough decision to South|pg||
nt|kareno: Now south gets caught up in the jolly auction.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's bad enough that 4@H is going to suffer a spade ruff ... but when the ruff is with a singleton trump, it's a whole lot worse|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So I reckon 4@H will be 3 down, for a useful swing to the trailing team|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: That four diamond bid indicates ownership of the hand and suggests what to do if the opponents compete higher.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|kareno: I think with the singleton king of clubs it was rather an optimistic bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: I am going to bed|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Ah well, didn't anticipate 4@S ...|pg||
nt|kareno: But he's hooked Drew Casen.  My, no double, no trouble :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bjacobs: That's 3 in a row wrong for E/W.  They probably wish they could go to bed also|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kareno: They will, soon enough, and probably they will be able to sleep in!|pg||
nt|kareno: Nice false card by east.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is it possible to put some blame on East for this?  That 3@S bid seems a little dubious|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|kareno: In the auction, it is hard not to show your suit - you could be simply cold for game.  There are risks on both sides, bidding or passing.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bjacobs: Yes, agreed|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s6|pc|h7|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|bjacobs: Barry Goren describes the 4@S bid as "dubiouser"|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He has clearly been reading (or seeing?) Alice in Wonderland|pg||
nt|kareno: I agree about 4@d - he is at least an ace off his bid.  4@s is less insane I think but looks bad because east is very thin for his bid.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Certainly, both East and West will feel terrible about this.  Both their bids were doubtful, but neither was outrageous|pg||
nt|kareno: Fortunately no one chose to double!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: for my money, 3@s was normal (if risky), 4@d was close to crazy, and 4@s was so bad as to be what a famous scientist called "not even wrong"|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|c3|nt|bjacobs: So in summary - North bid well|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bjacobs: (I like the glass being half full)|pg||
mc|8|nt|kareno: So it will be only 3 IMPs I think.  |pg||
nt|kareno: Or not :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: bessis sr. asked his son why he didn't return a diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: "because I didn't have one to return"|pg||

mb|p|nt|gambit: no 2NT this time|pg||
mb|3C!|an|4 !H, "7-9"|nt|dinos1: not a good start for EW in this segment|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 1@D not alerted by Passell but Strul shows two fingers and Passell nods|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bergen raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: a desperate S will bid 4, a disciplined one  - not so sure|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|lml: hi|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|harmon: Linda darling!!!!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Helness and Helgemo are that stabil that NS don't even think abough 4@H|pg||
nt|lml: hey Harmon |pg||
nt|gambit: what a balance!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: immediate 3@S, apparently had decided to balance over 3@H while Sadek had the tray|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dinos1: 2@d - GF checkback|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: this is not the worst 6@d in the world, and it will make on this lie of cards, but bidding it will be quite a feat|pg||
nt|dinos1: one more minor slam|pg||
nt|dinos1: now 2N - 3@d?|pg||
nt|dburn: especially since up to now, diamonds have not actually been bid at all|pg||
nt|dburn: if East bids 3@d now, they have some sort of chance, but...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: lynch folds her hand, crosses her arms, looks at her cards again|pg||
nt|gambit: double |pg||
pc|dA|nt|Vugraphzfe: helness can sniff helgemo's stiff @H on the bidding|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dburn: ...well, she bid it|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dinos1: well - W has good hand for pd|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: kibitzer asks Passell for permission to sit behind him - normally no one bothers to ask|pg||
nt|dinos1: side aces and KJ in trump suit|pg||
nt|stewball: and a legit @d suit|pg||
nt|dburn: not clear what 3@h is - 4@d would have been clearer to East, but Passell may intend to support diamonds at a later stage|pg||
nt|dinos1: @sJ wd be golden )|pg||
nt|stewball: i think 3@h is a punt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: carolyn still working it out|pg||
nt|dburn: Lynch not clear what it is either - if I were West it would show worry about clubs for 3NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: strul examining EW system card|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3@s now, no?|pg||
nt|dburn: but in any case East seems to have a 3@s bid and let the chips fall|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. Would have payed|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dinos1: now 4@c|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: yes, seems to cover all possibilities|pg||
nt|harmon: back to a ht and 4th d|pg||
nt|harmon: oops|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness leans over the table for a closer look at @CK|pg||
nt|gambit: I would too...........|pg||
nt|rodal f: If u take those two payers I put my money at Helness. A teambuilder and a sniffing nose better then the most of us.|pg||
nt|lml: it is an awlward card though|pg||
nt|gambit: Fabulous players, with the nose(s) of a bloodhound|pg||
nt|lml: this is a link for the half time scores http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2010/01/vanderbilt/|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: walid looking around, slightly impatient.  Sadek sitting back in his chair looking calm|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: and helgemo is always stoic|pg||
nt|rodal f: We don't use that type of dogs to much in Norway Cam:)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|dburn: no doubt Passell intends that as keycard for diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: but I confess that if I were East, the whole thing would be a complete mystery to me|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: strul writing a question then puts his pen on top so I can't read|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if East can work it out the final contract will be 6@d, but if she can't, there is the horrid possibility that it might be 4@h|pg||
nt|dinos1: I was await 4@c cue, but 4@h - it's above me|pg||
nt|chick: have to admit, I'd figure W for a lot of hearts right about now|pg||
nt|dinos1: mb it's @d rkcb? :)|pg||
nt|dburn: I ma sure that it is, but East is not sure at all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: the alerted 4@D previously and alerted 4@H here suggest EW are playing kickback over minors|pg||
nt|dinos1: but why E is thinking so long?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: but now that you mention it, I didn't see lynch alert 4@H when the tray came through|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: NS both holding their cards below the table and looking down|pg||
nt|chick: I wonder if they are using the old rule that says cards have to be played on the same day they are dealt?  :)|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a tough position for Carolyn Lynch - the spectators all know what West's bidding means, and so do North, South, West and I|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: kibitzer H. Lall seems to have fallen asleep|pg||
nt|chick: does this count for sominex coup?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sorry I can't get any read from carolyn, behind her shoulder so I can't see her face.  she's sitting very still this whole time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: strul gestures like he can't believe what's going on|pg||
nt|dburn: she may be wondering why, if partner did not bid Blackwood over 3@d,he can bid it over 3@s|pg||
nt|dinos1: better was cue 4@c and let E ask with 4@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: passell: carolyn, you've got to do something.  this is just ridiculous|pg||

pc|s3|nt|bjacobs: What should declarer play at trick 2?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|bjacobs: Perhaps he needs the @CK onside for his contract, so start on the clubs?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kareno: Club - |pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kareno: Have to hope the club is onside or south holds the diamond ace.|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|kareno: So if the key cards (club king, diamond ace) are split you will make the hand.  If both are in south you will make it and if both are in north you had no chance anyway.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bjacobs: Well, there are some variations to that, but agree with your overall strategy ... as did Casen|pg||

nt|rodal f: Just for fun. If N had 3@H and single @C by a 6NTS|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: one arm across his chest, other elbow on his wrist, scratching his chin|pg||
nt|lml: the way you have to make it in 6NT assuming no heart lead is actually a kind of strip squeeze|pg||

nt|rodal f: Helgemo by the pokerface and Helness the former world champ at poker|pg||

nt|dburn: but the break-even point for a grand slam is around the percentage chance of one 3-2 break (a little over 68%)|pg||

nt|harmon: 4hts +3 was a push|pg||

nt|lml: 6@S isnt terrible|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dburn: so, if you need a 3-2 break plus some handling, you should not be in seven|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: strul has been very composed throughout.  can't read what he's thinking, no indication he was about to take this leap|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dinos1: he has strong indication pd has stiff @h|pg||
nt|dburn: unless of course you are GIB, which would make seven without breaking sweat (not that software can sweat, but...)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h4|pg||

nt|dinos1: thk 2@c showed 5-4 in mm's|pg||
nt|gambit: could it be 4-5?|pg||

nt|bjacobs: I don't know the numbers, but I can see the reasoning for the heart.  You have an entry, find partner with a little something in hearts, and there's 4 hearts and the ace of clubs|pg||
