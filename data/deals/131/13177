pc|hA|nt|ralfwil: agree. Both jaws is on N|pg||
nt|jallerton: A spade lead looks most likely|pg||
nt|jallerton: forcing declarer to finesse at trick 1|pg||

nt|ralfwil: the @s finess|pg||
nt|jallerton: It's a shame Roland isn't playing in the Danish Teams.  I'm sure he'd be in this one!|pg||
nt|xenya: presents declarer with a club trick but gains a vital tempo|pg||

nt|jbgood: 12 of the 14 imps difference was the starting point - as a carry over from a previous encounter|pg||
nt|xenya: well done by NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: ready for actionboard :)|pg||
nt|othered1: This may be fun, depending upon who gets hung first by the misfit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bbo is set up to make this look like team match, but actually a PAIR event|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 tables in play, scored against datum|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both of these pairs use multi-purpose opening 2-bids -- most everything else is natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lilley-Nagy strong NT  Delivera-Robinson ACOL with Weak NT|pg||
nt|mwigor: hi al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome back Michael!|pg||
mb|1C|an|!|nt|peacokk: EW better stay low on this one|pg||
nt|jbgood: the Blakset lead is a carry over from previous encounter|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: NS playing 5card major and 15-17nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: EW plays 5-card major and 14+-17 nt|pg||
nt|jbgood: if N can get to know that Auken has a 5 card @d suit - difficult if Fredin jumps in|pg||
nt|xenya: we are in for a bit of fun here i think |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: 3@h = 10-12 and 3@s|pg||
nt|jallerton: EW play strong NT, NS play weak NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d = 5+@c and eighter invitational to game or invitational to slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2nt = minors|pg||
nt|othered1: may turn out to be a test of NS's countermethods to unusual NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I guess NS plays 3@c from North = I have my own suit and I want to bid at least game|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@s = I have my @s-suit|pg||
nt|othered1: Most pairs play something along the lines of "unusual/unusual" where minor suit bids distinguish hands with major suit lengths.|pg||
mb|1H|an|!|mb|p|mb|1S|an|!|nt|xenya: indeed -- what should N do now -- would 3@H be forcing -- or should he double or cuebid first|pg||
nt|xenya: so cuebid it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@h directly after 2nt is not forcing -- but 3@c is forcing with own suit - 3@d would have been forcing with @s support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: according to CC   1@C supposed to be  any 15+ |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: this is the longest Ive ever seen it taken to go 1c/1h/1s|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: maybe 2@h shows a weak NT type hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: sr I cant explain 2@h and 2@s ... South has not asked W yet :(|pg||
nt|jallerton: http://www2.bridge.dk/Systemkort.aspx?ID=375 for convention cards|pg||
nt|xenya: that didn't get them too far, did it|pg||
nt|othered1: if that's a cue-bid, not simply showing @H with game values (my method)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = FG, 25+BAL or weak 2@H/@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: the double by N paid off|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=9+ HCP 5+@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hmmm in that context, seems 2@S should be weak 2@S opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: 4nt = 1430 |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 5@c = one ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@h shows only 3-card @c ... and a weak nt-hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: I was close!|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: yes ... you are good :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, makes sense -- 3@C shows @Hs, 3@D would show a spade fit|pg||
nt|othered1: On the auction, 4@H is high enough.  With quiet EW's might get quite a bit higher|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: yes and 3@h natural nonforcing and 3@s natural support nonforcing|pg||
nt|mwigor: think you're looking at the wrong system card al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh -- Richman-Peake are EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok    1@C=2+   1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|mwigor: 1@h did in fact show @s though|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: not easy to see how many tricks declarer can take|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peake was south last set   AND  i have dain bramage|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: looks like Nagy is using the same Convention Card that I am :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: NS leads 1.3.5.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jbgood: was 4@c just a game force?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 4@c is explained as 2-suiter and GF |pg||
pc|s5|nt|jbgood: a likely 2 down..|pg||
nt|jbgood: the double by N was really a tough bid|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jallerton: maybe direct 3@c over 2@h would have been stronger and he has to go via 2@s to sign off|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|santyclz: Alerted so might be more.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|nt|santyclz: Thanks Jan.|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Peter Fredin is now calling the TD about th first board ... and the TD has arrived now |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Peter Fredin is explaining to the TD |pg||
nt|jbgood: wrong explanations?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c6|nt|xenya: not that the contract is in any danger but still|pg||

pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|jallerton: it looks as though declarer will have to fall back on the @d finesse.  |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jallerton: He might be able to make it double dummy with a red suit squeeze against South, but that must be worse odds|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|peacokk: I think it's too hard|pg||

nt|vugraphzey: I dont really know ... and now Peter Fredin has just told the TD that there was no problem ... ??|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: ready for the next one -- hopefully we'll not be disconnected anymore :)|pg||
nt|xenya: we need a new board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we have a very small group in this room -- holler if there's anything special you want me to rant about|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: there are 2 ways to play 1@C-1@H:1@S/1N   some say 1@S=3@S [1N is weak NT with 2@S]  others  1@S=2/3@S so 1N becomes 17-19 or 18-20 [stronger than 1N opener]|pg||
mb|1N|an|!|mb|p|nt|othered1: Steve Robinson -- "always open a 5-card major" -- wouuld approve of south's action.   But most players would open this hand 1@H, if they open at all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S normally 5+ --- but this is great lead director in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzey: 2@h= 12-15hcp and natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: if they open with a natural 1-bid, that is.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: trump lead should be on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I guess @c K|pg||
nt|ahollan1: CC doesn't describe the passed hand 2N -- but sure looks like they are NOT playing Drury|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N not forcing  [not sure if that is same as Semi-Forcing]|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzey: I got it|pg||
nt|jallerton: did you have inside information, Jan?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzey: me ... nooo|pg||
nt|othered1: can I assume double was penalty-oriented?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|santyclz: The controversial 3-card raise.  I like it.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jbgood: the low club lead may induce N to continue the suit.. |pg||
nt|peacokk: Will Konow be able to read @C3?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: W said: "Make some room for these" when he put down the @ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: dbl = penalty|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: but South is a chicken and pull to 3@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW standard signals|pg||
nt|ahollan1: concensus is 2N=max with 3@S    that's the bid that Drury handles with 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Michael is abandoning us for one of Women's tables|pg||
pc|s8|nt|othered1: Trump split doesn't help this, but favorable @H position may be useful.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jbgood: some like it, I prefer 4 card raise unless no other bid..|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, all|pg||
nt|xenya: hello again|pg||
nt|othered1: @S position isn't necessarily clear to east.  Couldn't south be 2=5=1=5?|pg||
nt|othered1: Of coiurse, east is thinking about lots more than the play to this trick.|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I have been told that the open room "crashed" -- but now we are back - but this board has been played - and South won 8 tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jbgood: many lead the second best from a bad suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: NS leads are 2.4.|pg||
nt|jbgood: second from top i mean|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: but later in the "game" they play 2.4. with attitude -- so then they play 2. from 4 bad ones|pg||
nt|othered1: Certainly a possible result|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|santyclz: Although this may not be the poster-child hand for it.|pg||
