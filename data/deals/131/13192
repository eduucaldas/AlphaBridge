mb|1H|mb|p|nt|han: 4SX might be -500 but can be -800 if the defense manages to play trumps quickly enough|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|han: what's double here?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Welcome all to segment 7/9 of the Australian Women's Trial|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|an|!|mb|p|nt|han: is it "please bid 4H if you have hearts"?|pg||
nt|han: or is it just penalty|pg||
nt|sybarra: Berten's had a great hand.... yikes that is over the top..|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@H on a minor suit squeeze?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|han: no chance on this lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: not after this lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|an|!|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|fann4: I think 6@H was a great bid, though it won't make.|pg||
nt|hedyg: i agree Jeff|pg||
nt|han: west plays 5-6, high-low would not be asking for a ruff but would be suit preferenc|pg||
nt|han: e|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: no cost to leading another club is there?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|han: so 5-6 should ask for a club return|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|hedyg: it was a pretty good slam|pg||

nt|hedyg: well if not the @Cs certainly looked better|pg||
nt|han: south showed 4+ hearts and dummy has 1098|pg||
mb|p|nt|han: not a great suit to switch to|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3D|an|keycard|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: Thompson is thinking...|pg||
mb|4D|an|keycard|mb|p|mb|4H|an|14|nt|han: he didn't know that one club trick was enough, then he also needed spades to split 3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: in @H he needed 2 finesses , in @c just 1|pg||
nt|han: but he could combine chances, hook heart, cash AK of clubs, if queen drops, test spades and if they split he doesn't need the secondheart hook|pg||
nt|hedyg: and then 1 of the black suits to come in|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: well 3 @C  is better that 4 sp (I think) |pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: pull AK@S before @d ruff|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|helene_t:  difficult to reach 2@h playing standard methods. E might want to bid 2@h over 1NT but for most pairs that would show extra values|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|han: I don't expect Bertens and Westra to get to game after 1NT|pg||
nt|helene_t:  3@h shows a good spade raise. 3@s ould have been weaker|pg||
mb|p|nt|helene_t:  would|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: so much for @cs|pg||
nt|han: and certainly not after 2H|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: sorry misread the handwritting|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|han: maybe it is possible, if Huub now bids 3C|pg||
nt|hedyg: gazilli would work well here|pg||
nt|fann4: They got to 5@C other table after a 2@H rebid.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would bid 2 @C on the first round,  (yes I know have 6 hts) |pg||
nt|han: Westra has a difficult decision|pg||
nt|han: I must admit I would have bid 2C instead of 2H|pg||
nt|fann4: Me too.|pg||
nt|hedyg: that @c suit is certainly good enough to bid|pg||
nt|han: don't really understand 2H with these suits, but in old school you have to rebid your major with a minimal 6-4|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe they do not have to have 4 to bid it |pg||
nt|fann4: And the @H suit is weak enough to not have to rebid.|pg||
nt|hedyg: over 2@c by S N could have bid 2@s etc|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|nt|hedyg: ok so lets try 3@s now|pg||
nt|han: 3S keeps 3NT in the game|pg||
nt|sybarra: and one suggestion is that N could bid 2 @C  over 1 ht |pg||
nt|han: I think Bertens will bid 3NT, he has told his story|pg||
nt|hedyg: if Bertens finds a 4@d bid now..|pg||
nt|han: and he even has help in diamonds|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|helene_t:  W's name has been corrected. thanks, operator :)|pg||

nt|mwigor: this looks like one down|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|han: oh, I was wrong about that|pg||
nt|hedyg: think again? LOL|pg||
nt|han: they reached it, now they have to make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: they got it right,  thats why they are playing :)|pg||
nt|han: Schollaardt loves underleading kings|pg||
nt|han: so he'll be happy here, spades or diamonds|pg||
nt|han: I would guess diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Westra says: I meant 3@s as a super card for @c's and he saw that as well|pg||
nt|han: because of the auction|pg||
pc|s2|nt|han: high from  even with an honor|pg||
nt|han: slavinski leads|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes and Bertens understood that|pg||
nt|han: toughest lead for declarer|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|mwigor: maybe a chance to make|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|han: he has only 1 loser but where will he get his tricks?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c3|nt|mwigor: @sA ruffing @s hook is probably best both on the hand and single dummy|pg||
nt|mwigor: but looks like she cant quite cope with the 4-1 trump break|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h4|nt|han: this is a bit dangerous|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s5|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|fann4: @SK lead other room made it very easy. (Even a small @S - same thing)|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|c4|nt|sybarra: he seems to have a plan |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|mwigor: needed to keep the low trump in dummy to have any hope of setting up lots of tricks without losing control|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h9|nt|han: good guesses here, hard to beat a declarer who guesses like this|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzfv: They're done at this table|pg||

nt|fann4: Bye all|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: table will remain open|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu jeff |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: and after 19 minutes the last round will begin|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Monique :)|pg||
nt|han: Huub pointed out that his line here was 100%|pg||
nt|han: if the club finesse loses then he still makes|pg||
nt|han: Also, he couldn't combine his chances in 2NT|pg||
nt|han: He was squeezed on the run of the clubs to make an early decision|pg||
nt|han: hearts was by far the best chance for two extra tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: about 5 minutes left before we restart|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry our song and dance routine is not enlivening |pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Maarten and Meike are back at the table|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|han: it is quite uncommon here|pg||
pc|d7|nt|helene_t:  I suppose NS play a weak 1NT opening, so that the 1NT rebid shows 15-17 points. |pg||
pc|d3|nt|fann4: How low do the Dutch go - when vul?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 cards and ??? |pg||
nt|han: what do you mean 6 cards?|pg||
nt|hedyg: does 2@c promise a major?|pg||
nt|han: Does QJxxx count as 6 cards?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mwigor: it feels like south bid her hand one time too many there|pg||
nt|mwigor: a little lucky not to be doubled|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: sorry i havent got the play |pg||
nt|mwigor: np|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|fann4: Pushy invite by N here - maybe the 3 tens influenced him.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|han: I think it is an automatic invite, this is a very nice 8-count|pg||
nt|fann4: QJxxx . not in my book. Vul I didn't think it was in anyone's book.|pg||
nt|han: This is a tricky hand for NS|pg||
nt|han: we know the club queen is dropping|pg||
nt|han: but will Huub test that before he takes the second heart hook?|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|helene_t:  the club lead actually gives N a chance of making the contract, if she finds the queen of spades|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: he will disc @hs|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c5|nt|han: oh wait, he doesn't need the heart hook|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhhhh no|pg||
nt|han: he'll just play on clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: not anymore|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d4|pc|s6|nt|han: no, this is not looking good for Bertens|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|hedyg: all eggs in the @H basket|pg||
pc|c9|nt|helene_t:  but she doesnt kno that hearts are 5-3. if they were 4-4 then conceeding a diamond trick would be the way to make the contract without having to guess spades|pg||

mb|1D|nt|helene_t:  multi 2@d ( a weak 2 in either hearts or spades). 2@h is to play in case E has hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|hedyg: 1@c 2+?|pg||
nt|han: On the other hand, should Schollaardt have prevented this by returning a diamond before declarer had the chance to play the spade ace?|pg||
nt|han: I think so|pg||
nt|han: yes 1C is 2+, as it is for almost every pair in  this field|pg||
nt|helene_t:  North has an awkward hand since she could double a 2@s opening and bid 2NT over a 2@h opening, but she doesn't know which E has|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: i guess 1@d really is @ds and not a xfer|pg||
nt|han: 4+ used to be the norm, now it is 2+, I don't think that 3+ was popular for very long|pg||

mb|1S|nt|athene: the defence just have to set up their diamond trick before the @SA gets knocked out|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|athene: that means not playing three rounds of hearts|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mcphee: not sure what methods n.s use|pg||
nt|cbernstn: 3nt?|pg||
nt|athene: east has normal @HQ lead, and if declarer ducks twice, west can signal she has four, so east knows a third round isn't cashing and might give away a vital tempo|pg||
nt|mcphee: Cindy has an eye|pg||
nt|athene: but if north covers the heart at some point, west might go wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: difficult, and need to have good agreements on carding|pg||
nt|athene: if 3@S isn't forcing, i guess you pass it with south's hand|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: playing weak jump shifts it should probably be forcing - but it's a common source of misunderstandings for sure|pg||

mb|1S|nt|athene: 2@C presumably majors - this won't work out so well for EW|pg||
nt|athene: East will surely force to at least the three level, and definitely will play in hearts|pg||
nt|helene_t:  2@c showing majors, or showing hearts+another suit, Fiona? Do you know?|pg||
nt|athene: the question is whether declarer can hold the losers to @CAK, @DA, @HK|pg||
mb|p|nt|han: We can see the result of one of EW's competitors, Verbeek-van Zwol|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: does Jansma sit,  yes  |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: Well, they will still gain imps for down one - West in the other room definitely took her eye off the ball|pg||
nt|athene: got the @HJ lead and tried the @HQ, so north got three ruffs|pg||
mb|p|pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|han: This looks like down 1, good save for EW as Wortel is unlikely to find the low club lead necessary to beat 4H!|pg||
nt|han: it also gives the same score as 3NT-2 at the other table|pg||
nt|han: I'm surprised that Begas did not act over 3NT by the way|pg||
nt|fann4: Presumably the @H3 cannot be from Q543|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H hard to read?|pg||
nt|han: maybe the colors made him pass, he figured that if he could make a game, 3NT was probably doing down quite a bit|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|fann4: This is a bit tricky. N is thinking about building a @C trick before the @SA goes.|pg||
nt|hedyg: passed the ball to Jansma|pg||
nt|fann4: On the underlead S now 'knows' N has the @SA|pg||
nt|hedyg: smallest @H probably asking for a @c return|pg||
nt|fann4: Right - and the suit preference implication.|pg||
nt|han: the underlead might have been necessary, picture declarer with a singleton spade and Qx of clubs|pg||
nt|fann4: Declarer coulbd be 1-2-8-2|pg||
nt|fann4: could...|pg||
nt|han: south would have to return a club to defeat it two tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes good defensive play by Paulissen|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: I think the best chance for south to beat this by two, is to attack in clubs - play three rounds of clubs giving a ruff/discard|pg||
nt|athene: then hold up in trumps with the intention of leading a fourth club and getting trump control|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|d7|nt|athene: it might not quite work as the cards lie, but that's the general sort of strategy you follow against a 4-4 fit when you have Axxx trumps|pg||
nt|athene: and South has almost that|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|nt|helene_t:  If dummy ruff clubs twice, S will make @h9|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: yes and if declarer ruffs one club in each hand, south gets a long heart|pg||
nt|helene_t:  oh now she played @h10 anyway|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|d2|pg||

nt|fann4: Claiming time!|pg||
pc|d8|pc|hA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|athene: leading the @H10 looks a bit odd - no way you can pin a singleton @H9 in south's hand after the 1nt opener|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|cbernstn: This looks like another lucky game|pg||
mb|r|mb|1S|nt|athene: south might have a toy to show a good 3-card heart raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Do you mean that the contract made, Kirsty?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: not so clear they will even try for game here|pg||
nt|athene: but in the absence of a toy, you redouble then bid hearts cheaply|pg||

mb|p|pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mcphee: the hand sure fits great|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H always there i think - declarer can't be denied a club ruff in dummy, can she, even with an initial trump lead?|pg||
nt|cbernstn: best line not so clear here--|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: it's actually quite interesting - declarer must play the clubs so as not to let west win two of them and play two rounds of trumps|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|mcphee: do not even think it matters bill|pg||

nt|poohbear: Fee you at this table?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: true :) but rebidding 1nt with a singleton in partner's suit is more common than opening 1nt with a singleton i think|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: yep :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|helene_t:  yes of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1 @d= 4+|pg||
nt|athene: it's hard for NS to get into the bidding here, although they might do OK in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: certainly at love-all you want to be playing 2@S rather than defending 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|han: good result for EW in the other table, 3NT not yet made but with the @hKQ onside it probably will|pg||
nt|han: Wortel will invite and Schollaardt will accept, I'm sure :)|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||

pc|c8|nt|athene: i like the diamond lead|pg||
nt|poohbear: @h lead for the money|pg||

nt|athene: rather than the club chosen in the other room|pg||

pc|c9|nt|han: good try, small spade, but it doesn't look like it will yield here|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: it's a low-level contract; you have trump control - probably there's no great urgency to get busy doing things|pg||
nt|helene_t:  declarer will probably discard a club on the diamonds so she doesnt have to guess the clubs|pg||
pc|d6|nt|han: a spade return will certainly make Schollaardt nervous but there is little he can do but finesse in diamonds and hearts|pg||
nt|athene: yes, the defence can't organise to put her to a guess in clubs|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: with north having no side entry|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h5|nt|poohbear: Still not easy. Need to guess @cs |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|poohbear: opps might not be able to take 5 tricks anyway|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|poohbear: a low @c now is best but declarer can still make by playing off winners and conceding tricks rto north who will have to give dummy the 9th trick|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: if Jansma thought N had an entry to his hand a @s back would work better than a @c switch|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hJ|mc|8|nt|poohbear: back to the straight @c guess. Declarer runs winners and in the 4 card ending keeps Qx   KJ  and leads a @c|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2N|an|transfer to D|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|athene: decent 6@D here|pg||
nt|mcphee: 2N must be !X trasfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north should definitely co-operate, with four trumps and three aces|pg||
nt|athene: over 3@S she should just bid 4@D, setting the suit|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|mcphee: I would not even consider looking for slam as S|pg||
nt|athene: 4@C/@H should be cues for spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|cbernstn: but 6 not that likely to make|pg||
nt|athene: south has certainly pushed it|pg||
nt|athene: i would just bid stayman and 3n with south hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: you are only facing a weak nt, could be a flat 11|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mcphee: we in north america usually do not xfer to a 5 card minor|pg||
nt|athene: when south transfers then bids spades she really says she has interest in playing in diamonds - now north should force that hand to slam - south has shown the hand she has but with ...|pg||
nt|athene: an extra diamond or thereabouts|pg||
nt|cbernstn: thought we might get a dbl of 4h|pg||
nt|athene: or if only 5-4, a really good hand|pg||
nt|athene: yes, strange non-double of 4@H|pg||
nt|cbernstn: but club lead will prob set 6 as well|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps west is waiting for the @H8 before she risks a double|pg||
nt|mcphee: some folks use this xfer sequence and then major bid to show a 5-4|pg||
nt|athene: it depends how you play stayman-then-3minor |pg||
nt|athene: lots of people playing acol use that as weak or invitational|pg||
nt|athene: and that has implications for other sequences|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mcphee: my acol days are long gone|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north really can't not bid a slam with AAA and four trumps|pg||
mb|6D|nt|athene: but she is going to have to guess a pointed-suit queen well|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: well these ladies are aggressive|pg||
nt|mcphee: and this is a NV slam to boot|pg||
nt|cbernstn: best play in spades is low to J if need a heart pitch--and that will fail|pg||
nt|athene: actually it might be easier with no heart lead? you have a chance to get a heart away on a spade|pg||
nt|athene: let's say @CJ lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: west missed the boat not taking time to dble 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: so you bash out @DAK then just lead a spade to the @SJ and you can crossruff the rest|pg||
nt|athene: ah no, sorry, east ruffs in before you throw the heart|pg||
nt|Walddk3: She is a hot favourite to go down unless she gets a spade lead|pg||
nt|cbernstn: playing east for Q@s picks up queen doubleton or 4th--not so with West|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: i mean assuming west finds the @HK when she wins the @SQ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mcphee: how unreasonable is it to take both @S and @D finesse?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: it must be right to play the top trumps|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mcphee: once this lead hits the table you have time on your side|pg||
nt|athene: that wins against 2-2 and if the person with the @DQ has to follow to three rounds of spades|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||

mc|10|nt|Walddk3: I think it was a good idea not to double 4@H. Then they would not have bid the slam|pg||

mb|1N|nt|athene: unlucky 6@D here|pg||
nt|poohbear: Of course there really isnt a guess since South would always rise ace and cash a @s and put a @H thru |pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|han: This could become interesting|pg||
nt|han: white against red there is no stopping Schollaardt with a suit like this|pg||
nt|han: Double by north will show values|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: 6nt will make if north takes the @SA too soon as she will get squeezed in spades and diamonds, even assuming declarer doesn't pick the diamonds|pg||
nt|poohbear: havent seen a 9-11 NT in a long time!|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|fann4: As you said earlier Han 'When in Holland".... do as the Dutch do.|pg||
nt|sybarra: same auction as other table |pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d major 1suiter?|pg||
nt|han: Paulissen takes a more direct approach|pg||
nt|fann4: I'm referring to super light weak 2 openings you discussed.|pg||
nt|han: there doesn't seem to be any lead that challenges declarer|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fann4: 3-3 breaks in the pointed suits make it easy.|pg||
nt|han: this is not easy for declarer, if east has Kx or Qx then it is better to play low|pg||
nt|hedyg: J@h makes it even easier|pg||
nt|han: so that the suit blocks|pg||
nt|fann4: @HJ is the 10th trick, and finally E will have to give a @C trick for 11 tricks.|pg||
nt|han: that might be necessary if west has the club ace|pg||
nt|han: playing low and taking the ace at trick 1 would be the way to go then, but now it is the way to go down|pg||
nt|hedyg: better assume W has 2 honours in @H for his bid|pg||
nt|fann4: Playing low is still ok. He can duck the @H and later still make 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|hedyg: can he if W has the A@C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably trying to figure out if Schollardt would lead low holding kqxxxxx |pg||
nt|han: if he plays for Kx or Qx he has to win trick 1 with the ace|pg||
nt|fann4: But looking at it single dummy it has some problems.|pg||
nt|han: with spades and diamonds 3-3 he'll still make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|han: very dangerous problem|pg||
nt|han: What's more likely, that west has KQxxxx or either Kxxxxx or Qxxxxx?|pg||
nt|han: the 2 shows an even number with at least one honor|pg||
nt|hedyg: KQ|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: it looks as though 2@D was not game-forcing for either EW pair here|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise west would surely bid 2nt or 3@D over 2@S|pg||
nt|helene_t:  yes, they play Acol|pg||
mb|p|nt|han: with K109 or Q109 he would have led higher|pg||
nt|hedyg: or an odd nr with no honours|pg||
nt|sybarra: he can not see 9 yet  now closer |pg||
nt|han: I think so too Hedy, good decision by Jansma|pg||
nt|poohbear: I assume 2@d was a transfer. I dont like transfers playing weak NT cause it gives next hand 2 chances to get into the auction|pg||
pc|c5|nt|poohbear: 4@h makes by force 5@h tricks 2@d 2@c and 1@s |pg||
nt|poohbear: so as long as declarer pulls trumps no worries|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|poohbear: The open room EW has an EXCELLENT mathpoint result|pg||
nt|poohbear: -400 will beat all the -420s and 450s|pg||
nt|poohbear: not as good at imps|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: even if declarer leads a spade to the @SK early it doesn't really help her all that much|pg||
nt|helene_t:  4NT quantitative, E can pass but with two points more than she already showed she must bid 6|pg||
nt|athene: she doesn't want to risk another one because then she would go down if south ducked @SAJx and diamonds might be breaking all the time|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|han: I think we can rule out the case of ann odd number without honors Hedy, Maarten is crazy but wouldn't bid on five small hearts|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|athene: she has to put the @SA onside|pg||
