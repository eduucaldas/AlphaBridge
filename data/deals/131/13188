nt|cuttysark: North led a low spade at trick 2 and South played the king - North's fault for preserving the jack|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sharkey: 3@D Bergen type raise|pg||
nt|sharkey: 10-12 I presume|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This would be a better contract if the East and West hands were switched |pg||
nt|ady: this should be flat  unless defence lets it slip through|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They might slip one trick - unlikely to slip 2!|pg||

nt|szalay: 3N is makeable N-S|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Hans |pg||
nt|hawe45:  thks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This MUST BE a coffee-board - I vote for 450 and no swing|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H/@S EW|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|szalay: anyone 4 3@C pre?|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: I strongly believe its an option in white|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Owen Lien and Doug Dey are players from North Carolina (District 7)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hey buddies, gl operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: things are going wrong with the boards|pg||
nt|haans: what should nilsen bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i can live withh 1N|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 NT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome back|pg||
nt|szalay: doubt they will bid it|pg||
nt|chick: 3N unspecified splinter?|pg||
nt|szalay: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: S  was our operator in last match |pg||
nt|yuval10: W is Giampietro, Cristina|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|haans: overbidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: there are chances for going overboard, funny hand first up|pg||
nt|szalay: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: n/s may get to game in no-trumps    likely to go down|pg||
nt|haans: yep |pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=76|pg||
nt|szalay: I suppose 2@H was both majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: you can find list of participants, and standings on that site|pg||
nt|szalay: btw its a bit strange North didnt open|pg||
nt|szalay: probably 4@D SPL is the best bid by West|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: will e/e  steal the contract    n/s can make a lucky 3NT  and make and make a safer contract in diamonds  10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: Israel play stad Israeli, I believe: strong NT, 5 card major, etc.|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: EW play natural, I think|pg||
nt|frankaus: not me  - 4 @S  would tempt me|pg||
nt|frankaus: then i'm a senior|pg||
nt|szalay: match starts with a boring 3N|pg||
nt|haans: doomed|pg||
nt|sybarra: and S has no further interest |pg||
nt|szalay: I dont suggest spl with 3 trumps only|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh, sorry,  S is brother of operator of last match |pg||
nt|chick: nor do I|pg||
mb|p|nt|VugraphPl1: http://michzimny.pl/bridge/2010/pila/gp.html|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 3NT    but hardly bidable|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=80&Itemid=72  for participants |pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW have 9 tricks as the cards are placed, agree.|pg||
nt|szalay: ok, u can drink coffee, he will make it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I suggest - but do not support|pg||
nt|chick: many people like to play 1@S 4@H as natural hearts, so 3N gives a way to make a heart splinter|pg||
nt|chick: but in this hand, I would just bid a 2/1 2@D (or other game force)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So would we all, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 2@H open room so will be a push|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 NT checking for slam ambitions|pg||
nt|chick: imho, S is not strong enough for 2N|pg||
nt|haans: no stop there|pg||
nt|yuval10: T@s looks like the natural lead|pg||
nt|haans: many nowday bid 2nt invite or better|pg||
nt|yuval10: link for results : http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/|pg||
nt|yuval10: click on "competitie"|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: do we have running scores Jacco?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: last time i saw Owen in Tri City (West Columbia) sectional, he is 21 y.o., educating in Economics branch in NC State College|pg||
nt|haans: clubs lead?|pg||
nt|haans: best|pg||
nt|ady: even on the lead will go down on a heart switch|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: well EW can make 6@D|pg||
nt|szalay: but if u have singleton, better to show it yourself|pg||
pc|s5|nt|szalay: after given bidding best trump play (double hook) is even better|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|szalay: ok, u can try 6@D, but its terrible...long run I dont suggest slams with 30 hcp and 2 balanced hands|pg||
nt|szalay: bid your games, take your tricks (by Hamman) is good advice in any level|pg||
nt|sybarra: I take it this is the "slam try" sequence |pg||
nt|szalay: with aceless 11, with Qx @C I wd just say 3N, confess|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I think east made a slamtry here, that is what i heard from the explanation from west|pg||
nt|szalay: a bit starnge 3@C rebid except its forcing (doubt it) with 9 top tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: nope it works now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East and West doÂ´nt play the same system here|pg||
nt|haans: not in agrement here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would RD there onstead of 2@d, 2ndly i would definitely start with 1@h|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D show support|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|ady: west should know on the 2 lead that north has 5 clubs|pg||
nt|haans: whappen happened her|pg||
nt|frankaus: 15 2 H in pd major - pd opens - how many will stay short of game?|pg||
nt|haans: non vul yes |pg||
nt|haans: you need 50% to bid game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: my sys card is 2/1 - so it's impossible to stop before game with EW hands|pg||
nt|szalay: and ART asking bid w/o shortness|pg||
pc|h5|nt|szalay: if it was slamtry, West wd accept for sure|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he and his mother Miss Anita are BBO players|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|haans: mirrow hands not thye best|pg||
pc|c3|nt|frankaus: i can handle the language of a child in hungarian but no idea about bridge terminology|pg||
nt|sybarra: this match is  2 Francy v   3 Neth. Blue|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He had seen his cards...(North)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: sry - crashed|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and then RD?|pg||
nt|haans: same distribution|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 2 off|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|szalay: we will see trump play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West is Giampetro|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: costs nothing to put up the q |pg||
nt|szalay: as u probably know: u must leas Q first|pg||
nt|yuval10: Operator can you please insert W's name?  |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|haans: flat board|pg||
nt|ady: cash to clubs puts pressure on west   has to discard a heart   but still down 1|pg||
nt|haans: are they playing Magic Diamond?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|szalay: French pair won Bonn Open Teams (Nations Cup) last year|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: would expect 130 to be flat    but you never know|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|szalay: personally I wd open West as 2N, if it starts at 20...7 controls, 4 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: i would sday just cards|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|haans: flat deal im sure|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yuval10: Croatia is 6th, Germany yellow 13th|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|sybarra: you had another website for us |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I dont see them yet. Red vs Blue was 22-8|pg||
pc|s8|nt|szalay: cause u can gain JTxx in South, but not in North|pg||
nt|szalay: lead|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: force dummy with heart now|pg||
nt|ady: othjerwise 11 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|frankaus: if !K off side even 9 may be hard to come by|pg||
nt|h_karluk: some pairs play support doubles and redoubles, a matter of style|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good tecnique - South might have all 4 trumps|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|haans: Magic Diamond 1@S 8-12 hcp|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: tried for Q and 10 of diamonds on side  |pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand comes home delightfully |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|vugraphzeg: I lost track went too fast. Both north and south kept the right ones\|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'm not so sure about this hand being a flat....quite possible for NS to stay away of game here|pg||
nt|haans: Croatia on 6th place|pg||
nt|yuval10: now J@c , otherwise only -1|pg||

pc|cA|nt|sybarra: over killed it...|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: Dennis already has a good set|pg||
nt|sharkey: :) - the important things Hans|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Director at the table asking Jackson about a score in the previous round|pg||
nt|haans: endplay in hearts possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: last board was 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: sorry for missing the last bid |pg||
nt|h_karluk: np|pg||
nt|szalay: I think West hand is more than 2N|pg||
nt|szalay: East, sry|pg||
nt|ady: J@C   big card in west hand   e/w can make 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: danger of 1@C being passed out|pg||
nt|szalay: I think 1@C is not an option|pg||
nt|sybarra: and stiff A of @C makes the hand easy|pg||
nt|szalay: either 2N or (semi)forcing 2@C/@D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ducking @C Queen seems better|pg||
nt|xenya: It says Round 12 here, but this is Round 10?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: round 10, yes.|pg||
nt|xenya: OK|pg||
mb|1H|nt|szalay: what wd u bid over 1@C-1x-?|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|szalay: funny board|pg||
nt|haans: card to 3@S?|pg||
nt|chick: 3@S for me|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|szalay: if u go to normal games: go as fast as u can...dont give them chance to interfere|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably a preemptive @D raise coming |pg||
nt|szalay: why not 4@H with passed pd?|pg||
nt|frankaus: Ax no the best stopper in the world often better played from Qx side|pg||
nt|szalay: slam is unlikely, @H are good, so?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but unlikely to keep e/w out of 4 @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: you had the one with the picture |pg||
nt|sharkey: appears 4@S can be made - however, may have transportation problems|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    n/s may be able to stop in 2@D|pg||
nt|chick: with all their controls, can EW stay out of the @D slam?|pg||
nt|szalay: good 4@Hs fails, worse 3N COULD be make (for @H lead)|pg||
nt|xenya: i would be content with just 1@S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: the website|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 12 tricks for me....previous hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Peter |pg||
nt|szalay: it was 11-14 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: looks like a 30 point deck to E |pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far EW 5@c-1 and NS 4@s -1|pg||
nt|szalay: pass with 4 hcp (including a King) very dangerous|pg||
nt|ady: even 2NT opening did not get them to game|pg||
nt|sybarra: can S venture a bid,  yes he does|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s may push them a bit here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I only bid 2 @H here with a @h-suit...|pg||
nt|chick: you think S's suit is too weak?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i would've pass from E, to be honest|pg||
nt|haans: nothing perfect|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: then we understand|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and E with 4333....|pg||
nt|szalay: wd u bid 5@D over 1@D-4@H-?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may go 2 @H all pass |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes but that is a blog|pg||
nt|ady: n/s likely to play 2@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would even not try it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Standings after 2 rounds: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=85&Itemid=79|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: after 3 rounds actuallly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but i would rebid 1N as West|pg||
pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: interesting 1NT|pg||
nt|szalay: in junior/female tourney I think to play weak nt 2/1 is an advantage|pg||
nt|haans: and a make :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yuval10: 4@s is some bid by N, P has a very good support though|pg||
nt|yuval10: and now probably bid 5@s ?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Gembick's pass??|pg||
nt|haans: 1n bye North?|pg||
nt|haans: nopåe|pg||
nt|haans: not a nice bid when vul|pg||
nt|sharkey: They've landed in their best strain|pg||
nt|ady: north 2@D rebid very respectable|pg||
nt|sybarra: dout you get killed at the 2 level,  I would bid  ...sort of only chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: *doubt |pg||
nt|chick: should make this|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: ir 2 @C all pass |pg||
nt|haans: 2@D must be 6-carder|pg||
nt|ady: unfortunately may well go down |pg||
nt|pelu: I would open 2NT (20-21) - over 1@C - 1X I bid 3MT = 15-18 with long @C|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|szalay: why not double by South?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2254 and 15|pg||
nt|hawe45:  By several levels too weak - and only @C-lead defeats 6 @D|pg||
nt|szalay: its not true Open highest level|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think it's makeable in any way, via @c finesse|pg||
nt|haans: if opps do not play @H raise @D|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: best spot for n/s is clubs  but unable to get there|pg||
nt|sybarra: a @h lead might not be so pleasant |pg||
nt|ady: may well be a swing for Netherlands|pg||
nt|szalay: in 4N|pg||
pc|c8|nt|frankaus: traffic light is red pays to be conservative|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well what do I know |pg||
nt|haans: 4@H young bidding|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this time black Kings are not favorably placed|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|szalay: e-w gave them all the chance|pg||
nt|xenya: they might get to a hopeless slam now -- and they did|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S?  rkk ? |pg||
nt|szalay: u can beat 5@C if u play some special (lavinthal, roman) signal over A of @S|pg||
nt|haans: E dont fool me|pg||
nt|szalay: some specs asked why|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D is makeable, this contract looks unlucky|pg||
nt|szalay: I think cause at Open this kinda toy isnt so dangerous|pg||
nt|szalay: in junior/female tourney 80% or more of the field unfamiliar with weak NT sys|pg||
nt|szalay: I think no pair in the World who wd play 5-3 minor-suit game instead of 5-3 major|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|szalay: I think first step to trap was 1@H...after that they came deeper and deeper|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: seemed like a cuebid auction to me|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=76|pg||
nt|sybarra: this site has a picture of the beautiful facility at the White House |pg||
nt|yuval10: will make 11 now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: it is a reburbished tennis club,  (still active tennis courts)  and a wonder bridge facility |pg||
nt|chick: no club finesse necessary |pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: yes agree should be 6 card suit  but AQ to 6 and 2 outside aces is top weight|pg||
pc|sK|nt|szalay: or by accident, only|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

nt|sybarra: long way to go |pg||
nt|frankaus: can get it home on this lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: honestly i would bid 4@d as West|pg||
nt|yuval10: the lead was one more good reason for not opening 1@h with such a poor suit |pg||
nt|haans: if only 1@S overcall is not game harder to find?|pg||
nt|xenya: i agree|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: @D back|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|ady: spade lay out bad for declarer|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rnmalik: the bidding sequence enabled EW to find the defence to 2@H|pg||
nt|haans: clubs ruff?|pg||
nt|frankaus: not easy to switch to 1S|pg||
nt|frankaus: @S|pg||
nt|xenya: i meant about the 1@H opening|pg||
mc|11|nt|szalay: 2@D was NOT xfer, was gameforcing stayman|pg||
nt|szalay: 3@D had shown a normal 6card or very good 5card suit|pg||

nt|szalay: it was an expensive count signal|pg||
nt|haans: slam?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Forget my 6 @D analize - I had only seen a 4-card @C at East|pg||
nt|szalay: btw Woolsey's policy is correct imho: if u have 5card suit: lead it, otherwise try to figure out pd's 5card|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: NS will make a lot of tricks here|pg||
nt|szalay: btw udca is better, cause u cant do this kinda "automatic mistake"|pg||
mb|1S|nt|xenya: but E did bid 5@C -- seems that's what W was eager to hear|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: South could have 18+ balanced or any 5-4, passing would be a gamble|pg||
nt|yuval10: cards lie very favourable for them|pg||
nt|h_karluk: umm, slam time for NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|sharkey: a + score is good here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4/4 or 5/3, in other words which black suit slam :)|pg||
nt|chick: @D7 = beer card ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_card|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like an easy game for EW here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|szalay: I think a tipical mistake to correct in junior age by coach(es): stop slam-greedy|pg||
nt|sybarra: they keep skipping the @S suit, but it is 4333   |pg||
nt|szalay: the imp score is done for GAMES, from both directions|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 21/19 and North lonely cowboy now|pg||
nt|pelu: for me 1NT or 2Nt!|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht 1NT better from north|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C not forcing|pg||
nt|szalay: that is the reason why in Hungary we tend NOT to lead 4card suit vs. 3N, rather "odd card major"|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: and whichever suit you pick things not much easy |pg||
nt|sybarra: auction almost screams for major suit lead |pg||
mb|3N|nt|h_karluk: 2@c now cbs- i suppose|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS past their comfort zone |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: South explained when asked that 3@c shows a good hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: I like 1 NT instead of 3@C|pg||
nt|pelu: sh for sure be a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@D will make life difficult|pg||
nt|haans: not easy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think experienced players would thank to 4@d overcall that alarmed about there's a highly distributional layout|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|haans: but what to lead|pg||
nt|frankaus: i like X here - (t/o) do something sensible |pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/ and http://www.bridge.nl/|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks Shirley|pg||
nt|xenya: and Jacco :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Jacco's may be better |pg||
nt|sybarra: mine is participants I see |pg||
nt|szalay: in my book 3@D is NOT forcing, so dunno why West bid on|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Nort has just 5 losers, however no entry to table|pg||
nt|ady: get clubposition will  make life easy|pg||
nt|sybarra: website,  on left you can go to participants, scores etc  |pg||
nt|chick: 2N = unusual (minors in this case), but sacrificing VUL is usually dangerous, and E doesn't have enough for 4@C imo|pg||
nt|chick: and W is sucked in by E's bid to a very risky save|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West is socked in by his own 2 NT-bid - lacking 2-3 key-cards vulnerable|pg||
nt|hawe45:  sucked|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: e-w has their 3rd dangerous bidding so far|pg||
nt|haans: i play 3@C as a prempt|pg||
nt|haans: many beginners believe all new suit bids are forcing even when reponers first say = have weak hand|pg||
nt|ady: diamond back best for now|pg||
nt|haans: standard for 2nt bid to be forcing nowdays|pg||
pc|d2|nt|frankaus: put me down as a pass with Wests hand - aceless 4333 even with 14 i would pass|pg||
nt|szalay: double by South?|pg||
nt|ady: 2 spades and a club it seems|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i play as jump rebid|pg||
nt|haans: clubsa clubs and more clubs|pg||
pc|d4|nt|h_karluk: and maybe that was a good reason to begin with a convention - the F******y|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Even green against red it is doubtful|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: welcoms Szalay |pg||
nt|ady: needs to cash club now|pg||
nt|szalay: normal bidding, normal contract, easy make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@h also works - natural|pg||
nt|yuval10: with some overtricks|pg||
nt|pelu: Howard 8Australia) after same start bid 1Nt in N|pg||
nt|szalay: Brigitta became a bit pessimistic abroad|pg||
nt|szalay: so here @S lead for us...the best one|pg||
nt|szalay: @D fulfills it|pg||
nt|szalay: as bridgeplayer I wd like to watch @S lerad...as Hungarian @D:)|pg||
nt|szalay: lead|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: Jacco's first web site, you can see the beautiful facility |pg||
nt|szalay: he has 2 aces, pd had shown values, they bypassed 3n...SO|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good lead|pg||
nt|szalay: odd card major, u know:)|pg||
nt|szalay: but are few exceptions what I dont tell u know...we need some secret weapons:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: so is @H in E:)|pg||
nt|szalay: unbid oddcard major, to be specific|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ok|pg||
nt|yuval10: red suit lead will give declarer his 9th trick, not that he can't develope one in @s anyway...|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|haans: with 4-2 draw trumfs and play nt|pg||
nt|chick: as a kib points out, E may want to double 4@S as well|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzeg: I made the classic mistake 4 and A|pg||
nt|szalay: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to be careful now not to lose a @S |pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi and welcome|pg||
nt|haans: have x for mopre cards|pg||
nt|pelu: nu lead can defeat 3Nt - 3!X then u set up 3 @D-tricks = 9|pg||
nt|ady: with hearts 4-4  heart lead would not beat the contract  defence take 3 hearts and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Facing a vulnerable 2 NT, East can only see 3 losers|pg||
pc|s2|nt|h_karluk: depends agreements just use 2@d or 2@h, and make things easier|pg||
nt|szalay: btw @H beats it as well|pg||
nt|rnmalik: It makes only on @D lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I mean as the cards are|pg||
nt|szalay: Hope can lead @S back, cause sure partner has T: otherwise declarer wd play small from dummy, probably|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Hop asking questions about possible distribution|pg||
nt|szalay: some spec suggested @C lead is ok as well: to be honest I dont lead opps suit from Txx...NEVER|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: of declarer's hand|pg||
nt|szalay: declerer could have 4card @S|pg||
nt|szalay: his bid just denies 4card @H|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|szalay: to bid games, take tricks...and double games when they r in vuln and we see the chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is a reburbished tennis club (still active tennis courts) and quite a terrific bridge facility also |pg||
nt|haans: many  mean 3n to show two cards in opening suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: now only @h will limit declarer to 10|pg||
pc|d5|nt|h_karluk: 11-15 5@h+4@s stuff|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: made a mistake when correcting the first score|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: was 1 off|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yuval10: otherwise 12 tricks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: this not definately making from south's point of view|pg||
nt|ady: if south plays K@H now then will be much better placed|pg||
nt|szalay: do u see any reason for small @D?|pg||
nt|szalay: except blocking suit?|pg||
nt|szalay: and to give fals impression to pd?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West might refret the small @D - but we do not know their methods|pg||
nt|szalay: I am informed Hungarian defender started @S as well|pg||
nt|szalay: he learnt his lesson well, wd:)|pg||
nt|szalay: I believe to lead small from Qx is technically bad|pg||
nt|szalay: when dummy has 76xx|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I agree adds to confusion for the P|pg||
nt|szalay: small @D back wd be a punishment...|pg||
nt|szalay: but:|pg||
nt|szalay: who has J of @S?|pg||
nt|szalay: surely West|pg||
nt|szalay: otherwise declarer wd play small, not Q|pg||
nt|szalay: at trick 1|pg||
nt|szalay: so @S is a 100% lead|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: everything is on the right spot for NS|pg||
pc|sA|nt|szalay: I was there..in February..I remember was terrible cold and windy|pg||

nt|ady: but east can get 2 spade ruffs|pg||
nt|pelu: yes: @Sk - @s ruff - @c to A and @S ruff|pg||
nt|haans: to strong for flannery|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: K@S   spade ruff   then trump back and another spade ruff|pg||

nt|h_karluk: esp when u r a passed hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, 2@c is invitational |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i agree with 3@c rebid, invite or better, i can live with that 5 losers, no matter entry to table, i know no need to cry when they sets, favorable vuln was another tempting factor|pg||

nt|haans: not bad|pg||

mb|p|nt|frankaus: commentators curse strikes immediatly:(|pg||
nt|ady: re|pg||
nt|szalay: but East knew J of @S for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: if he wasn't passed hand then 2@d would've been GF|pg||
mb|1N|nt|szalay: in that case I wd go out for water, to refresh myself|pg||
nt|ady: an easy 3NT  played by south|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|sharkey: E has the "perfect" Dbl hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 23-17 this time, another interesting board|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: they even played after the claim..|pg||
nt|szalay: Frenchmen are very conservative with 4card other major|pg||
nt|ady: at least 10 tricks in hearts for e/w|pg||
nt|ady: west decided not to open|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Also, yes|pg||
nt|szalay: logic is more important than defence agreements|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: can they make 6@D|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|h_karluk: uh oh. 1@s ? hmmm :)|pg||
nt|pelu: his problem was the 4 card @s|pg||
nt|ady: west wasting no time  4@D  is for hearts|pg||
nt|szalay: I agree with xfer to 4@H: IF we have weak 6card and strong 4card major, kinda stayman is preferred|pg||
nt|szalay: in Hungary we had a 1st class teacher/player in 60s, called Lajos Widder|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2NT in N for minor|pg||
nt|szalay: his favourite proverb was: "I hate maths...only important thing is: all players has 13 cards and all color has 13"|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3 NT|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|szalay: terrible slam, imho|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a @C can be pitched on @S but they dont know:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to play 2 @H's here|pg||
nt|szalay: in Hungary we play Michaels a bit different way than World do|pg||
nt|szalay: NOT weak or strong, rather "at least inv values, no upper limit"|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: dont they play Drury?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: During the white house juniors very nice weather last few years|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Dennis Bilde had his moment on the first board. now 1 highpoint average over 3|pg||
nt|haans: best game 3nt but ...|pg||
nt|szalay: Lazar could NOT bid 3@D as P/C, cause its inv with @S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|frankaus: water? - do u know what fish do in water :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: those hands are usually easy to bid :)|pg||
nt|ady: natural    should have had a 5th club|pg||
nt|haans: no way to show @D :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: how about pass :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: he already had 3@c in his hand..|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: practically|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - E/W need a quiet board|pg||
nt|szalay: I think South's hand is close to 2N, imho|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: kibs asking 6@D      can make    but bad contract  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: no way|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: but last moment rethink :P|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - Jacks are doubtful values and 3-3-3-4|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: I think 9 hcp with ruffing values is more than regular 10 hcp|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  2nd negative|pg||
nt|pelu: great bid!|pg||
nt|haans: clubs lead ?|pg||
nt|szalay: I think 6@C is very optimistic, especially in all white|pg||
nt|szalay: all white is NOT a position where u need be greedy|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: likely 11 tricks, next one|pg||
nt|ady: trump switch  will hold to 10|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: agree was an observation|pg||
nt|pelu: 9½ out of 10 will lead @S|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|pelu: ½ lead @d! :)|pg||
nt|ady: natrual spade lead 9 tricks    this likely to be a swing for Australia|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All results (including butlers and hand records) at www.nbbportal.nl/1003/ > 'competitie'|pg||
nt|szalay: r u sure?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No intermediats|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N found no defense to 5@H and has settled for -2 as we see|pg||
nt|chick: I wonder what the difference between that sequence and 1N 3N is|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 3NT has 9 tricks via 3@s , 2@h, 2@d and 2@c|pg||
nt|xenya: this rates to make  think|pg||
nt|haans: my guess 2@S 2nt replacement|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, Hans|pg||
pc|h4|nt|szalay: important thing after bad boards: leave table for a while and reconnect:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: All Israels I know play drury, maybe west didnt think his hand was good enough\|pg||
nt|ady: club lead will need spades 3-3 to pitch losing club   and heart lead will need king well placed|pg||
nt|sybarra: wrongsided this one|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3nt will make with the   @HJshort|pg||
nt|pelu: no|pg||
nt|szalay: trump LEAD does it|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   meant trump lead|pg||
nt|szalay: cause North could lead 2nd one|pg||
nt|szalay: I think to lead trump is close to suiced from South's seat|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and no DBL|pg||
nt|szalay: of course, it could make for 3-3 @S, but: in that case 5@HX is at least 500, can be 800|pg||
nt|szalay: I dont like to save|pg||
nt|szalay: I like when WE score|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||
nt|haans: weak responder 2 jacks|pg||
nt|haans: easy to raise @D|pg||
nt|xenya: this may be a swing as pass by W over 1N is a fair option|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|xenya: not for juniors perhaps though|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzeg: kleine kamer|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think an imaginary problem there : say east has AQ96-KT983-7-J42, okay guys, would bid 1@h or still double over 1@d? my opinion : if East wld X with that  hand then 2@d cue by W ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: gr8 :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Probably take @C finesse and end up with 11 tricks|pg||
nt|szalay: and his pd has strong hand: give her the last decision:)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|vugraphzeg: oops that was personal|pg||
nt|ady: clubs blocked fortunately|pg||
nt|sybarra: so you get lucky sometimes |pg||
nt|ady: east condiering unblocking  hoping 10@C with west|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with that junk even they show me full hands i could not dare to land 3@c|pg||
nt|haans: @CJ not cover not two entries to dummy|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: good play that unforunately gets no reward|pg||
nt|sybarra: valiant try |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: both north and south complimented east|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wud bid 1@H|pg||
nt|haans: me 2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  North now asks himself: WHY did I take that trick?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, declarer can't set up the long suit, so he should take Yuval's line|pg||
nt|xenya: and that's what he is doing it seems|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|szalay: its risky|pg||
nt|szalay: @C/@S is sure exit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: flat board|pg||
nt|szalay: when we need just 1 trick to set: lead safe is a basic rule|pg||
nt|szalay: just interchange Q and J of @D why was it terrible try|pg||
pc|s4|nt|h_karluk: so that matters, 1@h just F1 fine|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think better let @C9 run as N pegged with @CA|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: @D9 lead helped - folloed by low club switch|pg||
nt|ady: 9@D lead in CR   taken bu king and low club switch won by 10    the diamonds set up   and spades finesses|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: if West put up @SQ when lead from hand @D will not set up|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: even if they make will lose points |pg||
pc|c8|nt|cuttysark: Treu - the old entry-destroying play, more common in the post mortem  than at the table|pg||

nt|sharkey: rite Jacco - we can :)|pg||
nt|ady: should have cashed AK diamonds before heart to the 9   quenn might have dropped|pg||
nt|szalay: routine 3N/5@C|pg||

nt|sybarra: e/w can make a lot of hts here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  and they wiol get 450|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not @D 7 - 7 @D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  but only 12 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: @ST did it|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ady: 20-20 again|pg||
nt|yuval10: S will be surprised to see his P opening|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just hook @h K and have fun|pg||
nt|szalay: I wd use exclusion RKC after xfer by South: 4@D-4@H-4@S/N (depends on RKC-style)|pg||
nt|h_karluk:  3 S had 0, now E has 1|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20 |pg||
nt|ady: however Netherlands got the 7 imps back hand 2  geting to game  where France stopped in 2NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzeg: south had 1 on 4 aswell and 2 on 2|pg||
mb|1S|nt|h_karluk: pass by E?|pg||
nt|haans: agree with that pass|pg||
nt|szalay: btw I wd bid 3N immediately here: dont give them chance for right lead |pg||
nt|szalay: slam is very unlikely|pg||
nt|ady: n/s haved a choice   5@C  or 3NT     3NT scores better|pg||
nt|pelu: the 8. @C is the key-card for direct 3Nt - u dont need an H in @C from pd|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S-lead might bring 480|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No...|pg||
nt|szalay: it requires a perfect sys and silent opps to bid it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So am I - no double is OK|pg||
nt|szalay: 6+5+2=13|pg||
mb|2D|nt|haans: easy to get -800|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w have 9 tricks in spades as they lay|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, if 4@s is exclusion |pg||
nt|szalay: bid 6 or 7 depends on answer|pg||
nt|sharkey: Wonder if S knows what to do with all the points  - he'll probably drop stiff @SK to maje 4@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: *make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and that's 10 boards sets, presumably predealt hands|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think that's wild|pg||
nt|sharkey: S may raise...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think i wld bid 3@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: he did, west goes into the tank now|pg||
nt|haans: west  do not promise @SK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i dislike 3@d with 16 there|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - Vul at IMPs think it's right|pg||
nt|pelu: 2Nt = I can help in @c|pg||
nt|pelu: what can S bid now ? X for @S-stop?|pg||
nt|ady: not sure it right to settle for 3NT  switch K@D with A! north and west  then 6@C makes and 3NT down 1|pg||
nt|ady: k@D   and A@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: double on 2@S? Would  anybody else do that?|pg||
nt|ady: no   |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: maybe my question also gives my opinion :)|pg||
nt|pelu: no X - in my book 5-card - or very strong 4-card suit - u can exp that pd bid 4@S over 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: stay low here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|haans: trash Stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Wud you pass and hope they land in NT?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks Dennis :)|pg||
nt|haans: but give east a @D ruff then...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now i pass to 4@d|pg||
nt|sharkey: After 1 NT opening West likely to be on lead anyway|pg||
nt|haans: and they are non vul|pg||
nt|pelu: I am with u Tim|pg||
nt|szalay: 2N: 14+, bal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - back to my first view|pg||
nt|szalay: 2@D was nat and GF|pg||
nt|xenya: NS might get in trouble now|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@d by N perhaps?|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H = strong hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  pass perhaps?|pg||
nt|xenya: but just might -- N can rebid @Ds and S should pass|pg||
mb|3D|nt|szalay: to stay at the table is a bad habit..I think no kinda rule in bridge|pg||
nt|szalay: if North says 3@D exclusion RKC could help...and later a grand slamtry:|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2@H help me now|pg||
nt|ady: west trying to scramble to a better spot|pg||
nt|szalay: North wd accept with source of tricks, for sure|pg||
nt|szalay: I dunno why to ask stopper with QJx|pg||
mb|3N|nt|VugraphPl1: sorry|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like a misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@D is crazy ....|pg||
nt|haans: wd|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think one should double when he/she's sure for -2|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: West gets whathe asked for|pg||
nt|davidb: hi good evening|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just curiosity, when someone would intervene?|pg||
nt|szalay: 4@D was optional RKC|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: std polish lead: low from doubleton|pg||
nt|ady: looks like down 1|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it will turn on the right side for NS|pg||
nt|h_karluk: bid 6 make 7 now, bid 7 go down 1 when @h K fails in a different layout|pg||
mb|d|nt|yuval10: 4NT probably interpreted as 1430 by S|pg||
nt|sybarra: awkwardly,  but "we" landed |pg||
nt|szalay: bad hand, 2KC and queen|pg||
nt|szalay: but he has 0:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 4m for me only as invite to 5|pg||
nt|haans: as good as 1nt ruffing @D|pg||
nt|ady: yes  nice contract    I dont agree with 3NT immediate |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: should east have removed to 2@S  with 3 in each?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think many would double to show equal strength|pg||
nt|haans: you win some lose some|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to play for the drop in @H's |pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 boards 50 minutes|pg||
nt|xenya: exciting|pg||
nt|haans: dinessing inh spades|pg||
nt|yuval10: very good X by E, sensing the misfit|pg||
nt|haans: raise @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: but can they beat 3N?|pg||
nt|haans: if decl play spade = go up with Q|pg||
pc|d9|nt|szalay: some players play GF means: "forcing to 4-of-minor if 3N not possible"|pg||
nt|szalay: I predicted small slam|pg||
nt|szalay: good play is often slow play, imho|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: Hung may hope for 2nt from W|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi David welcome aboard|pg||
nt|rnmalik: could S on 5@D bid 5@S?|pg||
nt|szalay: play will be fast|pg||
pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: i think i would definitely couldn't find that grand - when @h K wasn't at partner|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||

nt|haans: 16 no good lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: E would've done better by ducking the @d|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|ady: try a club|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|szalay: small @S now|pg||

pc|s2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|nt|pelu: 2@H sh 4-4 or 4-5 - with 5-4 West could bid 2@S - still weak|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: players taking a short break|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 7@S|pg||

nt|szalay: I dont use "congrats" in this case:) lucky is more normal:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT on a @D lead|pg||

pc|dK|nt|sharkey: West held off after last hand... - not unexpected|pg||

nt|sharkey: 4@S set with @D shift|pg||
nt|haans: missin game not junior style :) sort of|pg||
nt|haans: you needed some thing like Blue clubs to find slam|pg||
nt|yuval10: once again NS will make their contract, probably with an overtrick|pg||
pc|s2|nt|szalay: What wd u lead from T962?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 10 |pg||
nt|szalay: I think either 6 or 2 (depends on your methods)|pg||
nt|szalay: T is not a honour:)|pg||

nt|xenya: on 1, the Poles in the other room wound up in 4@H -- strange contract. 11 imps to Israel|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|szalay: but South thought more undertricks, I believe|pg||
nt|ady: acw  king ace and those trumps  seems double right|pg||

nt|sybarra: pickling his own suit however |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No Lavinthal this @C 8...!|pg||
nt|chick: not me, I would open 1@D and rebid 2N ... I think HCP is an excellent indication of NT values, and I stretch of the standard HCP only with a strong source of extra tricks|pg||
nt|haans: you did last time we played 3ntxx|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yuval10: 3NT would've been easier here|pg||
nt|szalay: when longer trump could be tapped, moysian (4-3) fit isnt so good|pg||

nt|sharkey: sry - E doesn't have any useful pitch on @H10|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT   looks like failing here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You know you can't let the opponents in when they have cleared spades, so forget about clubs and turn your attention to diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: as kib suggested could make 3NT with K10 diamonds onside|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not too difficult when West discards diamonds onthe hearts|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|ady: apparantly that was the play in the CR|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Well he can't afford to throw spades, and clubs feels wrong|pg||
nt|ady: on that play you can make 6@C|pg||
pc|s6|nt|copeyj: N/S have done superbly here to reach the vastly superior game|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|cuttysark: And they will lose another imp for their pains|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|sharkey: when did they agree on @C as trump??|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C a good cottract    n/s unlucky tot to get a swing on this   avouding 3NT|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: single dummy there is an added chance--play for W to have 5 spades, 3 diamonds to the ten, and KQ of clubs--then you could win third spade and play back another hoping he cashes ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the last one. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: They agreed at the 5-level, Carl|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|sharkey: yes - I thought 3@S was cue with @H trumps....|pg||

nt|cuttysark: I think 3@S was sort of 4th suitish, and North patterned out|pg||
mc|11|nt|marlowepi: natually double diamond finesse requires much less than the squeeze|pg||

qx|c7|st||md|1SA95HKJ7DAQ93CT84,SQT842H84D862CQ63,SJHAQ63DJ74CAJ952,SK763HT952DKT5CK7|sv|b|nt|szalay: better if games are played by stronger hands, especially if balanced|pg||
nt|rnmalik: or bad assessment:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: rebid showed 18-19, so if there is a nearest game why not 3N by S|pg||
nt|szalay: touch and go 4@H|pg||
nt|szalay: it will makes if trump by opps: no option just staright @C hook|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 20-20 1st time there|pg||
nt|pelu: strong 2@C and positiv response - if East can show 4 controls - easy way to 6|pg||
nt|haans: not me but 1NT = 4 controls|pg||
nt|ady: 4 hearts fails with K@D wrong|pg||
nt|chick: There IS a guideline that says when the auction goes 2N P P, 4th seat should double on principle, because the dummy has no entries for finessing and declarer will have to play out ...|pg||
nt|chick: of his own hand |pg||
nt|chick: sometimes it works :)|pg||
nt|szalay: funny when it was passed out North could think: "ouch, may I double yet?"|pg||
nt|sybarra: true chick |pg||
nt|szalay: if pd has Q of @D: 3 off|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: de Pagter tried to trick Lazar on the last brd with discarding @d|pg||
mb|1D|nt|h_karluk: 24-16 again partscore|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: 5431 is a good treatment|pg||
nt|szalay: Poles invented 5431-convention|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East will welcome a @S-opening + do.-support|pg||
nt|haans: not 2 aces K = 1 contraol Ace 2|pg||
nt|haans: all may be in @D'|pg||
nt|sybarra: but at imps,  maybe not always prudent |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I always find the making lead when my partner doubles on principle :(|pg||
nt|xenya: yes perhaps it means: pd, we have more points than they -- but so what?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|szalay: jump to 3M means: stiff major, 3card other major|pg||
nt|szalay: the weak nt|pg||
nt|szalay: East hand is interesting|pg||
nt|szalay: I wd rather dbl first and bid @S thereafter|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: (no entry back after ruffing finesse)|pg||
nt|szalay: easy 4@H/3N by E-W|pg||
nt|haans: best is 5@C/D|pg||
nt|yuval10: the favourable lie of the cards here mean that NS can make 12 tricks in both minors|pg||
mb|2N|nt|szalay: especially usefull if u open 1N with 5card M|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: true but transfer then bid game what do u loose?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 1N then 2@s good, so you can play direct 2@s raise 8-10|pg||
nt|haans: x with void can be costly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@c rebid then 2@s rebid, so all pass would also be nice|pg||
nt|szalay: In my book REOPENING 2@H shows kinda hand, what West has|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT is the best spot|pg||
nt|szalay: so NO W2 in balancing seat|pg||
mb|3H|nt|szalay: routin 3N is coming|pg||
nt|szalay: so here 1N-3@H-4@S|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6@S as they lay|pg||
nt|pelu: back - with cofee :)|pg||
nt|szalay: but its close decision, anyway|pg||
nt|szalay: I wd bid my suit if its NOT the highest ranking one|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: if no trump lead/switch: he will ruff a @D|pg||
nt|frankaus: now is X pen?|pg||
nt|szalay: "who has the @Ss, has the power"|pg||
nt|szalay: as Lenin said 93 years ago|pg||
nt|szalay: (sadly he used "sowiets" instead of @s..he could play bridge|pg||
nt|szalay: could not|pg||
nt|szalay: btw did u know our games hero, Culbertson left Russia after Revoultion?|pg||
nt|szalay: his father was a civil engineer there|pg||
nt|haans: xenya we have all been there|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: so 2 @S transfer to minor? |pg||
nt|szalay: but they wont bid with missing ace and trump queen|pg||
nt|pelu: over 4@C and no @D-cue West would know|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@H is a very poor game. It requires more than the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|haans: poerknight: yea but if u hear 4 controls and see 3 kings in ur hand it can only be 2 aces and riye he is|pg||
nt|pelu: so NL on the scoreboard|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i think passive trump lead auto there|pg||
nt|szalay: best defence is: cash 3 winners and @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - West should know pd's loaded; however, with 4 HCP too weak|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and maybe @h3 would give a better idea - say 3/5 leads thoroughout in sys card|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i did not get that 2@h|pg||
nt|chick: in balance seat, 2@H should show good 6 hearts and opening hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: in my book that is a slamtry in M, balanced|pg||
nt|szalay: to lose balanced slamtry with 6bagger is gap, anyway|pg||
nt|yuval10: now declarer can play A and Q@c discarding @s|pg||
nt|szalay: no ruffing finesse is suggested|pg||
nt|szalay: no 100% line, and could be lead from doubleton, but that is the best line, imho|pg||
nt|h_karluk: because you have 2 aces and 3 times trumps, whenever you are in can easily work to cut a ruff|pg||
nt|haans: many do not pen until opps reach game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: while found 5/2 @s fit why he got risk , hard question to reply|pg||
nt|davidb: easy  X  by N  -Ns  at least 6 trumps & more points|pg||
nt|haans: pass on 1nt = balanced hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: F1N not in sys?|pg||
nt|szalay: back...its the most boring set so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: Poland got the 11 imps back quickly, when they stopped in game on 2 (6@H was the contract here) |pg||
nt|ady: north minimum  lacking aces   and wasted K@H  definately should settle for game|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: Even on that lead, and with hearts 3-2, it can't make|pg||
nt|chick: there is no such thing as a preempt when opps have already quit bidding :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Chick |pg||
nt|hawe45:  The 800 was only 500 in OR - same contract, and same 2 NT from West|pg||
nt|xenya: that's true, Hans|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT is a bad contract but can be made|pg||
nt|yuval10: by double finessing the @d's|pg||
nt|haans: a make if no @D loser|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|szalay: I think South could bid 4@H with 3 aces over 3@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that would help East to see South has only a @h card|pg||
pc|sK|nt|szalay: imagine North has spade Q instead of K of @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: so -1 here|pg||
nt|szalay: we can talk cause its an absolutely uniteresting making 2@S|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

pc|s8|nt|haans: i have not seen Blue clubs having what is needed for many years But this time yes|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: should make the rest |pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|h_karluk: you know sometimes even a nickel is important :)|pg||

nt|szalay: 6@S is makes yet|pg||
nt|szalay: but that is really terrible|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and 6@C|pg||
nt|szalay: personally I wd bid 6@C as south, P/C|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: q : x or 2N or 2@d?|pg||
nt|haans: good bid 1nt or more no spade|pg||

mb|3C|nt|szalay: wd, Brigitta|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: dont see other option than 3N now by North|pg||

nt|szalay: pass, 1N....period....2@C|pg||
nt|haans: suprised they do not play trf here|pg||
nt|sharkey: if it's a "coulda" - probably too close to x at IMPs|pg||
nt|ady: west overcall on 4 card suit understandable|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our next match (and last today) in about 40 minutes: Norway vs Italy|pg||
nt|haans: South endbid :)|pg||
nt|szalay: with likely plus for n-s, anyway|pg||
nt|pelu: easy 1@s - u dont X on 5 card major exp u are very strong|pg||
nt|rnmalik: X must with this hand|pg||
nt|szalay: in this case often happens save over 7@C:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why not 5 NT by South - pick a minor - and 6 @C =  MY suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|szalay: do u see any reason not to pass 2@H?|pg||
nt|szalay: or a strength showing double is an option yet|pg||
nt|xenya: on 3, where Israel bid up to 5@D here, the Poles in the other room reached an even worse contract -- 3N -- 3 off and 3 imps to Israel |pg||
nt|h_karluk: in new year teams, we were tied 42-42, then 3 more extension boards, again tied, and last board just won with 1 IMP |pg||
nt|szalay: personally I wd bid 3N over 2N|pg||
mb|p|nt|VugraphPl1: last board   thanks all |pg||
pc|c7|nt|VugraphPl1: http://michzimny.pl/bridge/2010/pila/gp.html|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D by S?|pg||
nt|xenya: what do you think about N's double?|pg||
nt|frankaus: X do something sensible is a reasonable call |pg||
nt|sybarra: agressive?|pg||
nt|szalay: its normal, imho|pg||
nt|xenya: is it penalty?|pg||
nt|szalay: especially if u play sound overcalls..and send greetings to East for reopen|pg||
nt|xenya: penalty-orinted i should say|pg||
nt|szalay: 8-10, bid sthg, imho|pg||
nt|szalay: I doubt it|pg||
nt|frankaus: no here  - opps bid & raise  X = t/o|pg||
nt|szalay: btw if South passes and North bids @C a BIT easier, but isnt easy yet|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but makes with a lucky @d hook|pg||
nt|szalay: they play: minor ALWAYS P/C|pg||
nt|szalay: and NT means: I have a suit|pg||
nt|haans: assume 3nt show 5 @H puppet variation|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting 3N rebid: partner, i want to be in 3N even if you have 4 hearts? |pg||
nt|yuval10: there are no difficulties here with the play|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H = no major |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 3NT showing hearts, yes|pg||
nt|xenya: ah i see|pg||
nt|chick: actually, most of the interest in these hands has been the bidding|pg||
nt|haans: fiver|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks|pg||
pc|c6|nt|szalay: I think North can double 4@S quite confidently|pg||
nt|szalay: or 3N yet..J9xxx in 1 suit, AK9x in other|pg||
nt|pelu: @D now will set up a ruff for East|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|szalay: I dont like to play lowlevel dbls as penalty|pg||
nt|xenya: so it was for minors|pg||
nt|szalay: good point, Frank|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Lotan put the Hoody of the sweater on his head after being doubled|pg||
nt|szalay: to lead stiff in pds suit is tempting|pg||
nt|pelu: the set look boring - but in almost all matches we have seen strang mistakes that cist - here good bridge|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|haans: what did x mean?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Takeout?|pg||

pc|h2|nt|hawe45:  E/W got the chance...|pg||
nt|sharkey: this match could be a blowout|pg||
nt|haans: can East ever have 4 spades|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - we all know, what England RED means - after this battle|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: typical agressive junior double|pg||
nt|frankaus: t/o do something sensible|pg||
nt|haans: many bid 1@S to show five x to show 4 |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@h+4@c+1@s + 5@d are his tricks|pg||
nt|szalay: with 28-29 hcp 3N generally is safer in 2 balanced hands, cause no bad trump break|pg||
nt|chick: 3@C may be checkback|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hawe45:  Dangerous double - no defence against 4 @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: I like Dbl instead of 2@S - EW lost the whole 1 level thus they end up in this hopeless contract|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But played by South, 3 NT is percect - NOT by North|pg||
pc|hT|nt|frankaus: if u beat it 1 - what have u gained  - canu really expect to beat it 2 or more?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he leads, and has @d A, planned after @s A knocked out wld score many tricks to set|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|szalay: not to play Q was a clear error, imho|pg||
nt|szalay: ruff and trump now|pg||
nt|drorp: hashavti ze helgemo hamavrik mibenehem|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|szalay: its strange to me that no one plays 3@C as puppet to 3@D: in that case u can stop in 3@D (crucial if u respond 1M with longer @Ds)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Only @H is worse|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hawe45:  Well done - Jack = @D|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|sharkey: Indeed - things are going the Danes' way|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West can play the @H 3 to the 4...|pg||

nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!|pg||
nt|szalay: does West have way to show @D lead?|pg||
nt|szalay: or may be HIS lead, even better:)|pg||

nt|frankaus: fine operating Jacco <clap> <clap> <clap> <clap>|pg||
nt|szalay: I think South has INV with @Cs, lets say 3@C is normal or 2N...|pg||
nt|pelu: by West|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Strange, that 6 NT went down - you have 12 tricks with safin the @D-suit and take the losing @H-finesse|pg||
nt|szalay: South is female and 16-years old only|pg||
nt|szalay: 3@D was Rubenshol: @Hs, inv +|pg||
nt|szalay: doubt West wd pass it|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 3@D Switch, rather|pg||
nt|szalay: switch: dom and sub in one?:)|pg||
nt|szalay: South of course passes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: it was west thinking but i try to do 2 bids at a time|pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks like it should make |pg||
nt|szalay: r u sure?|pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder|pg||
nt|szalay: 1@S, 1@H and how many @Cs?|pg||
nt|ady: looks like west has mis understood partners bid|pg||
nt|szalay: its Molenaar's double session|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: west might have explained this as weak with @d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: imho 5@c unbelievable|pg||
nt|haans: 3 down in 5@Cx|pg||
nt|haans: 2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C is not an overbid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could any lead a trump from QT - say to 5 clubs contract? :)|pg||
nt|haans: 3@Dx|pg||
nt|szalay: thx all, it was fun, and interesting|pg||
nt|szalay: probably West, her screenmate is trhinking|pg||
nt|szalay: am I right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: correct|pg||
nt|szalay: Danke|pg||
nt|rnmalik: absolutely and difficult waters for EW|pg||
nt|szalay: 4@S RKC or rather cue?|pg||
nt|szalay: muddy waters, rather|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: possibly 3@s would come|pg||
nt|xenya: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=85&Itemid=79 for standings after 9 rounds|pg||
pc|sA|nt|szalay: I think its going down for @S lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes!!  here we go again|pg||
nt|szalay: 6@C for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: East wasnt passing, I could tell you that|pg||
nt|xenya: E seems to have taken partner's 4@C too seriously|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what would you lead vs 5@c ? @h A/K or @s A+x ? :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT the easiest as they lay    but likely to play 5@C  which would certainly go down to a trump lead   4@H can make|pg||
nt|haans: at last|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yuval10: E likes his hand|pg||
nt|haans: game at or|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i do not believe my eyes, 4261 with 6 hcp and 3@d 3rd seat both nonvul :)|pg||
nt|davidb: not a  lucky decision |pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: dbl gazzili like bid?|pg||
nt|ady: not likely to play 4@H|pg||
nt|frankaus: have you heard my view on playing 5 minor contracts?|pg||
nt|ady: managed 3NY OR|pg||
nt|ady: OR|pg||
nt|h_karluk: esp when N showed his interest on unbid suits (the reds)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry there were a huge misjudgement|pg||
nt|sybarra: might we try 3 @C now?|pg||
nt|pelu: ther5e are 8 "top" tricks - but not when u take @cK (see the 10) and run @cJ :(|pg||
nt|ady: must have got club position wrong in OR  to go so badly down in 3NT     low club and when 10 appeared went up with king and finessed 9|pg||
nt|pelu: 0,1 sec late, David :)|pg||
nt|ady: yes    you are too quick for me Peter|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|szalay: if u travel across the World, better to agree 2suiter overcalls|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: the problem was the semi natural 1@c openingbid i think|pg||
nt|szalay: if a bid (semi)natural, better to treat it as natural, eg. to play (1m)-2m as Michaels vs. prepared 1m yet|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to misguess hts here also |pg||
nt|h_karluk: obviously - east players happy with that 7 hcp|pg||
nt|yuval10: maybe too much for a 4-3-3-3 hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 4@S cue|pg||
nt|szalay: I predict -1 and Hungary's win|pg||
nt|yuval10: this is the last board of the 10th round now|pg||
nt|chick: S is likely to get endplayed |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: declarer didn't play for endplay but just claimed on 2 finesses|pg||
nt|yuval10: you can hardly endplay him|pg||
mc|10|nt|szalay: but grand slam try with missing ace was a mistake, anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 1430, I guess|pg||
nt|xenya: admittedly, he does have a great hand|pg||
nt|szalay: nbo pressure for N-S now|pg||
nt|szalay: the real issue is 3m is nat or stopper asking|pg||
nt|haans: not to happy with @H lead|pg||
nt|ady: in what   4@H?|pg||
nt|haans: nt|pg||
nt|frankaus: its like kissing your own sister - even when its right ---- its hard to get excited about your prospects|pg||
nt|szalay: any bet?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good defense now and we have a new leader:)|pg||
nt|szalay: every dutchman says: he will make it|pg||
nt|szalay: btw, this is the last board of set and last set for me|pg||
nt|szalay: thx all your patience, it was funny, anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: no defense, however good, will work if declarer gets @Hs right|pg||
nt|szalay: that is what bet about|pg||
nt|szalay: bt w to play safety @H in good direction is risky:|pg||
nt|szalay: he could lose 2 @Ds and a @H|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Vladimir:)|pg||
nt|szalay: so better to play for @H to king and small one, imho|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Rashed:)|pg||
nt|szalay: do u agree?|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|po-s: why not|pg||
nt|chick: don't have to, it's automatic|pg||
nt|po-s: why would you need to - in 5H defenders helped a lot|pg||
