mb|3N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: 1nt=12-14|pg||
nt|jallerton: a nice close match|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 1@d shows a natural 1@d opening - BUT it is not a balanced hand|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Hello Everyone.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|xenya: that was quick|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: hi all... and wlc back |pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody!|pg||
nt|xenya: hi Ed|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: last 16 boards for a place in the final tomorrow|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks precipitous to pass 2@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards for all participants online at http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2010/OpenWom/systems.html|pg||
nt|poohbear: I am shocked that Neill didnt bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: no problem Jan, you are surely NOT to blame:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: if they need someone to blame then I am ready to be the one -- used to it -- my wife do it all the time|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2nt = 18-19 semibalanced or marmic 4-1-4-4|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: 2@c = GF|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@D = @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@c=strong natural @s+@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@h = natural|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@c is optimistic but is makeable|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@s is 4.th suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: Both 3NT and 5@c are sensible contracts.  6@c is indeed optimistic|pg||
nt|ahollan1: latest cumulative scores at http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/DisplayResultsT?club_event_id=14747&header=abf&fdc=ODWBEXACG|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: 6@d slightly better since you dont need the @h ace onside to make|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ralfwil: But they are there:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: EW in 4th with 68    NS 10th with 40|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jallerton: and 6@c is worse played by South|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree. Both jaws is on N|pg||
nt|jallerton: A spade lead looks most likely|pg||
nt|jallerton: forcing declarer to finesse at trick 1|pg||
nt|xenya: best lead -- unbid suit, that simple|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards for all participants are online|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2010/OpenWom/systems.html|pg||
pc|h8|nt|xenya: and an equally quick 2 down i suppose|pg||
nt|ralfwil: too bad communications to aviod tge @s finess|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: EW leads are 1-3-5 against trumph and 2.4. against nt|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the @s finess|pg||
nt|jallerton: It's a shame Roland isn't playing in the Danish Teams.  I'm sure he'd be in this one!|pg||
nt|xenya: presents declarer with a club trick but gains a vital tempo|pg||
pc|h3|nt|santyclz: Ouch, 3nt by s is a lot easier.|pg||
nt|jbgood: and game in @h - one of the denominations available to get the gaqme bonus|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! a typical Roland:)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jbgood: game, actually..|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   lets you watch any/all of the 4 vugraph tables from Australia or the 2 tables of Vanderbilt Final from Reno|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jbgood: may ber duplicated at the other table, depends on the NT range|pg||
pc|d2|nt|santyclz: Easy now.  No longer any possibility of losing 3@hs and a @d.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jallerton: now it all bolis down to how declarer pays the @c suit|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: remains to unblock now|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Blakset has the @c K in hand|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jallerton: *boils|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|jbgood: tu Jan |pg||
nt|jallerton: now obvious reason to go against the a priori odds|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: both pairs use  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||
mc|12|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|poohbear: well done|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone|pg||
pg||
qx|c2|st||md|4SAJ6HAK8D9CAKQJ98,SQ7542HJT95DK8C74,S8H432DAQJT2CT632,SKT93HQ76D76543C5|sv|n|nt|santyclz: Well, even I would have a good chance of making 6@ds on this hand, let's see if it's biddable.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 12 of the 14 imps difference was the starting point - as a carry over from a previous encounter|pg||
nt|xenya: well done by NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: ready for actionboard :)|pg||
nt|othered1: This may be fun, depending upon who gets hung first by the misfit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bbo is set up to make this look like team match, but actually a PAIR event|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 tables in play, scored against datum|pg||
nt|poohbear: well we move from a small slam to a grand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both of these pairs use multi-purpose opening 2-bids -- most everything else is natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lilley-Nagy strong NT  Delivera-Robinson ACOL with Weak NT|pg||
nt|mwigor: hi al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome back Michael!|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|peacokk: EW better stay low on this one|pg||
nt|jbgood: the Blakset lead is a carry over from previous encounter|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: NS playing 5card major and 15-17nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: EW plays 5-card major and 14+-17 nt|pg||
nt|jbgood: if N can get to know that Auken has a 5 card @d suit - difficult if Fredin jumps in|pg||
nt|xenya: we are in for a bit of fun here i think |pg||
nt|othered1: 7 needs a little luck in @D|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzey: 3@h = 10-12 and 3@s|pg||
nt|jallerton: EW play strong NT, NS play weak NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d = 5+@c and eighter invitational to game or invitational to slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2nt = minors|pg||
nt|othered1: may turn out to be a test of NS's countermethods to unusual NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I guess NS plays 3@c from North = I have my own suit and I want to bid at least game|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@s = I have my @s-suit|pg||
nt|othered1: Most pairs play something along the lines of "unusual/unusual" where minor suit bids distinguish hands with major suit lengths.|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer has to decide how to play @ds in the grand. percentage is to take the finesse since there arent enuff entries to ruff 3@ds|pg||
nt|poohbear: dbl shows the majors I suspect|pg||
nt|othered1: I see four entries in @C|pg||
nt|poohbear: you are right|pg||
nt|poohbear: so ruffing out the suit is correct|pg||
nt|poohbear: makes the grand about 68%  well worth bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|othered1: Yes it is, if you are sure the opponents will be in small slam.  For whatever chance they aren't, increases the odds you need on the grand|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: indeed -- what should N do now -- would 3@H be forcing -- or should he double or cuebid first|pg||
nt|xenya: so cuebid it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@h directly after 2nt is not forcing -- but 3@c is forcing with own suit - 3@d would have been forcing with @s support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: according to CC   1@C supposed to be  any 15+ |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: this is the longest Ive ever seen it taken to go 1c/1h/1s|pg||
nt|poohbear: Very few partnerships have adequate methods to deal with 2@c interference|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: maybe 2@h shows a weak NT type hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: sr I cant explain 2@h and 2@s ... South has not asked W yet :(|pg||
nt|jallerton: http://www2.bridge.dk/Systemkort.aspx?ID=375 for convention cards|pg||
nt|xenya: that didn't get them too far, did it|pg||
nt|othered1: if that's a cue-bid, not simply showing @H with game values (my method)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = FG, 25+BAL or weak 2@H/@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: the double by N paid off|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=9+ HCP 5+@S|pg||
mb|6C|nt|ahollan1: hmmm in that context, seems 2@S should be weak 2@S opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: 4nt = 1430 |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 5@c = one ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@h shows only 3-card @c ... and a weak nt-hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: I was close!|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: yes ... you are good :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, makes sense -- 3@C shows @Hs, 3@D would show a spade fit|pg||
nt|othered1: On the auction, 4@H is high enough.  With quiet EW's might get quite a bit higher|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: yes and 3@h natural nonforcing and 3@s natural support nonforcing|pg||
nt|mwigor: think you're looking at the wrong system card al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh -- Richman-Peake are EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok    1@C=2+   1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|mwigor: 1@h did in fact show @s though|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not easy to see how many tricks declarer can take|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peake was south last set   AND  i have dain bramage|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: looks like Nagy is using the same Convention Card that I am :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: one of the least discussed aspects of partnership|pg||
nt|othered1: Many partnerships use the pass over the double to show some values, redoubliing with a double-negative.|pg||
pc|hJ|mc|13|nt|vugraphzey: NS leads 1.3.5.|pg||
nt|poohbear: this should wrap easily. Could Gill have bid 7? Hard to imagine that you are off an ace when partner leaps to slam|pg||
nt|othered1: If that's your agreement, it's reasonable to play suits by responder as natural.  Here north could show values and @D simply by bidding 2@D.|pg||
pg||
qx|c3|st||md|1SK6H754DT864CAQ97,SQHQJT8D7CJT86432,ST8542HK63D532CK5,SAJ973HA92DAKQJ9C|sv|e|nt|peacokk: Could have been worse also|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I dont really know ... and now Peter Fredin has just told the TD that there was no problem ... ??|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: ready for the next one -- hopefully we'll not be disconnected anymore :)|pg||
nt|xenya: we need a new board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we have a very small group in this room -- holler if there's anything special you want me to rant about|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Thus letting the double work for the opener's side.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: there are 2 ways to play 1@C-1@H:1@S/1N   some say 1@S=3@S [1N is weak NT with 2@S]  others  1@S=2/3@S so 1N becomes 17-19 or 18-20 [stronger than 1N opener]|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|othered1: Steve Robinson -- "always open a 5-card major" -- wouuld approve of south's action.   But most players would open this hand 1@H, if they open at all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S normally 5+ --- but this is great lead director in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: 2@h= 12-15hcp and natural|pg||
mb|1H|nt|othered1: if they open with a natural 1-bid, that is.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|jallerton: trump lead should be on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I guess @c K|pg||
nt|ahollan1: CC doesn't describe the passed hand 2N -- but sure looks like they are NOT playing Drury|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N not forcing  [not sure if that is same as Semi-Forcing]|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: I got it|pg||
nt|jallerton: did you have inside information, Jan?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzey: me ... nooo|pg||
nt|othered1: can I assume double was penalty-oriented?|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: The controversial 3-card raise.  I like it.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jbgood: the low club lead may induce N to continue the suit.. |pg||
nt|peacokk: Will Konow be able to read @C3?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: W said: "Make some room for these" when he put down the @ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: dbl = penalty|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: but South is a chicken and pull to 3@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW standard signals|pg||
nt|ahollan1: concensus is 2N=max with 3@S    that's the bid that Drury handles with 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Michael is abandoning us for one of Women's tables|pg||
nt|poohbear: Neill treating his hand as 5-6?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Trump split doesn't help this, but favorable @H position may be useful.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jbgood: some like it, I prefer 4 card raise unless no other bid..|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, all|pg||
nt|xenya: hello again|pg||
nt|othered1: @S position isn't necessarily clear to east.  Couldn't south be 2=5=1=5?|pg||
nt|othered1: Of coiurse, east is thinking about lots more than the play to this trick.|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I have been told that the open room "crashed" -- but now we are back - but this board has been played - and South won 8 tricks|pg||
nt|poohbear: It will be hard for him to imagine his partner is 4-7|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: many lead the second best from a bad suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: NS leads are 2.4.|pg||
nt|jbgood: second from top i mean|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: but later in the "game" they play 2.4. with attitude -- so then they play 2. from 4 bad ones|pg||
nt|othered1: Certainly a possible result|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Although this may not be the poster-child hand for it.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you want  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/    lets you spy on ALL ongoing vugraph matches -- one window per table|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Looks like it, but it isn't 6-5 and could be costly if partner had thoughts of going on.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jbgood: he may just make it|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|poohbear: they land in an OK spot. Prob goes down on a @s lead|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|peacokk: Well done|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Pip says  @S raise but happy to play NT|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|nt|poohbear: here?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kiwibridge: hello Barry seems no commentary here yet|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|jbgood: if he throws a heart, and cash a di and clubs to get his spade jack en passant|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: sr about the speed -- but this time I am not to blame for sure|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jbgood: the ten may have been better, but a spade switch was imperative|pg||
nt|jbgood: needs the clubs to be 3-3 - he will make now|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S 3-3 and @HA onside -- only when you are in partscore|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|c3|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4-2 and offside is part of The Great Shuffler's sense of humor|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|jbgood: nice play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when you are in game|pg||
nt|poohbear: as long as South dummy locks West after winning the King|pg||
pc|c5|nt|poohbear: only chance now is Qx @s or obscure @s @d SQ|pg||
mc|10|nt|poohbear: for those of you wondering why Neill didnt open 1@s ...... U will have to ask him :)|pg||
pg||

nt|peacokk: np|pg||
nt|jallerton: an overtrick imp for N/S probably|pg||
nt|Walddk11: They placed the tray on the wire and off we were|pg||
nt|poohbear: prob figured that East would surely have dbled 3@d with KJ109xx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: small audience tonight -- let me know if there is anything special I should address in my ravings|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ralfwil: 3NT on E looks good|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: good day folks|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|ahollan1: in ACO, 2@H is just 1-round force|pg||
nt|poohbear: or AKJ109x|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=ART, 9-14, 4+@S, maybe longer @C/@D, NEG DBL => 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=NF, 6-10|pg||
mb|d|nt|jbgood: yes - 2 down means the ten - nice defense|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@s = 10-12 and 3@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: suspect we'll see 2@S-4@S|pg||
mb|r|nt|jallerton: West is worth a reverse|pg||
nt|poohbear: not sure what NT range EW are playing but I am sure Gill is not evaluating it as weak|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder what Steve Robinson would say about that 1@D opening -- he espouses that not opening a 5-card major denies holding one.  So with things like 5=1=0=7, he'd open 1@S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk11: They should be spanked|pg||
nt|poohbear: I dont like Gosney's dbl. He cant possibly know a @s lead is correct against 3NT|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzey: here are the action again|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: must admit i have never had to defend againt this kind of 2@C opener|pg||
nt|frankaus: this is Match 3/9 to decide the aust open team top 3 of 10 pairs will form a team|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but i would bid 2@S now, a kind of pass the buck bid|pg||
nt|frankaus: many play it here |pg||
nt|poohbear: These auctions are very tuff on the dbling pair. Need very solid agreements as to whats what|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reynolds wondering about 2@H vs DBL|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood:   1 was duplicated both biddingwise and resultwise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or .... delayed Splinter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other rooms will have same problem but after 1@S or 2@S opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kanektar started with DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the "match" score is an illusion.  This is a PAIR event but BBO handles teams better than pairs|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would pass and reopen 3@cs with a dbl when it came around to me|pg||
mb|3C|nt|frankaus: 2@C both Majors is a good method IMO , allows u to bid 2@D with no real preference of 2M with a pref, of 2Nt if game interest or better|pg||
nt|othered1: and no idea whatever that he can beat 2@SXX|pg||
nt|poohbear: ahhhh dbl is To of @cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: NS will get the spanking instead i'm afraid|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i would have bid it faster, this slow bid is for sure only a 4 card suit|pg||
nt|poohbear: for instance is this dbl TO or penalty?|pg||
nt|poohbear: of 2@h|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Alerted from both as T/O :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: I guess they discussed this :)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  1NT was 15-17|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a unilateral penalty double in front of the length is so rare as to not be worth using|pg||
nt|poohbear: Gill has to be worried about pushing them to a makeable game|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: with such a sparce hand, i hadn't considered 4@D - especially if EW play that 2@S can be passed|pg||
nt|poohbear: I guess thats a safer way to play|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|poohbear: thats why he isnt competing|pg||
nt|othered1: That's a good  treatment (what I use, also).|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jallerton: South may try the effect of @sJ or @SK here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Difficult lead for S|pg||
nt|jallerton: his heart pips do not make that suit attractive|pg||
nt|xenya: @HQ now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: @h Q is taken and put back again|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Jens is certainly thinking about @h Q|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Sorry, lost the play here.|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: I'll give you the result :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think I'd try @CQ -- but no lead automagic|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and @C other than Ace :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: You was right Jeffrey!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in OZ - do your ACOL players say 2/1 is forcing to a certain level, or can opener's rebid be passed?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nagy-Lilley using upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Dwayne Hoffman|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just no small @S :)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|frankaus: G'day Dwayne|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but still 9 tricks|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzey: south is thinking.....|pg||
nt|jbgood: he may go down now, but when the spade ten came to light I think he might just have played trumps|pg||
nt|keylime:  greetings all from Manassas Park, VA - nice to be here|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: oh my, derailed now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi Dwayne|pg||
nt|poohbear: as it turns out he cant even make 3@H|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jbgood: losing 2 spades and a club|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 club ruffs available|pg||
nt|jbgood: but difficult for N to see?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Everybody agree with 4@h?|pg||
nt|frankaus: scoring is IMPs V a mean datum of the middle 3 tables|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Richman 'sounds like u have a good hand partner good luck'|pg||
pc|c5|nt|peacokk: Yes, it was|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: imo -- the auction screamed for a trump lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play Weak NT throughout -- so that would NOT apply to 1@S-2x:2N |pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: W needs to learn more about the hand and the @HQ looks fairly safe at this point|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was that really Q@H operator?|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|frankaus: of the 5 in play the extreme scores are disregarded in calculationg the mean|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|vugraphzey: will it be 1100|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Nagy probably thought that Robinson's 4@H was a working @H honor rather than shortness|pg||

pc|h2|nt|poohbear: Declarer will have no problem guessing @cs but will still lose 5 tricks|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: W's heart discards suggested @S values|pg||
pc|hT|nt|keylime:  So, Frank, they are not cross-imped per se, correct?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|xenya: E's rather|pg||
nt|xenya: but E has to unblock now to avoid getting endplayed |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I am not absolutely sure if I made a mistake on the last @h play -- It might be that E played @h 8 instead of @h 5 ... sr all if that might be the case|pg||
nt|xenya: is that so obvious?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer can make this simply by splitting out the trumps|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzey: speed up time @cJ :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: obviously Delivera was on same page as Robinson|pg||
nt|frankaus: the match scores shown here are only score between the the two featured matches |pg||
nt|frankaus: no|pg||
nt|frankaus: the datum can be a real wildcard I hate it but what is the alternative?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i totally disagree with keeping two clubs, what purpose does it serve|pg||
nt|keylime:  Frank, is this the standard method for Australia in choosing a team?|pg||
nt|frankaus: there is a carry forward from the relevant 10 board match played in stage 1|pg||
nt|poohbear: perhaps declarer might have gone up @h ace to block the suit if North had Hx|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: unlike the previous 2 boards -- this hand is just a matter of overtricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can but that is also potential suicide|pg||
nt|poohbear: but opts to go for safety first " knowing " the @d ace is onside |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|jbgood: i like 4 @h|pg||
mc|8|nt|poohbear: but they retained the @d ace as a further entry so that play would fail|pg||

nt|xenya: considering that the auction may well be duplicated in the other room, this might not be all that bad |pg||
nt|ahollan1: this could be fun|pg||
nt|frankaus: sponsors do put money into the game allowing some to play pro when they could not afford to play otherwise, but there some who  dont like that|pg||
nt|keylime:  300 undoubled - living a bit of a charmed life there South is.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ouch|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|jallerton: If South responds 1@S that will slow West down|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer took the percentage play. Assuming he thought North had a @h honor|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: or 1@h transfer|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 1@h = transfer|pg||
nt|jallerton: 4+@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: ys|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: and might have longer @d suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: or longer @c suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: again 2@H is NOT automatic game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nagy has a few options  because of  a) strong 6@S  b) 3@H & void c) good 2nd suit|pg||
nt|poohbear: TO dbl?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: ok.do you want professional player?|pg||
nt|tez: sry|pg||
nt|othered1: Is it now normal to overcall 1N with iffy 15 counts?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well -- some of those options are gone now -- nice bid Ian|pg||
nt|frankaus: bob richman is our no1 masterpoint holder|pg||
nt|poohbear: I wouldnt vul opp a passed partne|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=11-14 HCP, if 4@H/@S 11-12|pg||
mb|2S|nt|poohbear: r|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps in second seat not vul|pg||
nt|poohbear: 1D shows @h|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|peacokk: S thinks he has a 15-17NT|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@h was brave|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@d = natural - normally longer @d|pg||
nt|poohbear: 1NT denies 3@h and shows a weak NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: ns plays 1nt as 12-14 in first and second seat .... and 15-17 in third|pg||
nt|peacokk: oh, sorry|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like 3@h is the limit for EW|pg||
nt|jallerton: now West justified to jump to game|pg||
nt|xenya: i've seen people doing that over and over again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gosney only bid 4@C  and Hans-Nunn bid a grand .... but 7N down 1 won't score well at all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@C-6@D:6@H   just maybe |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S by Reynolds is part of the YBYSIBM System|pg||
nt|ahollan1: You Bid Your Suit  I Bid Mine|pg||
nt|poohbear: Gill giving the opps one more shot at bidding game. But normal to reopen|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I don't play hands well enough to be able to afford that|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: duplication is difficult when W opens 1nt in the other room (playing weak nt) :)|pg||
nt|xenya: however that was not to happen -- N doubled in the other room|pg||
nt|poohbear: wouldnt be my choice but might be dictated by system|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would bid 2@c if able|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  only 2@H/@S are natural|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: mouse problem it was a low @H to Ace :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: remember this isn't really a team match --- the Australian Trials [aka Playoffs] is run as a PAIR event|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|othered1: I'd bid onemore on west's hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: me too|pg||
nt|othered1: My partners don't solo to the 3-level to give the opponents numbers.|pg||
nt|poohbear: looks like down 2 unless the defnse loses their @d ruff. Declarer still needs to pick up @ds by leading high twice out of his hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: pins the 10|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzey: you couldnt know :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzey: 2@c is forcing 2@d .. and now 2@h is invit with 5+@h|pg||
nt|xenya: instead of 1NT|pg||
nt|othered1: Isn't this now cold?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so -- we only know what ONE of the other pairs has done    there are actually 8 tables in play|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: easy 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jallerton: South had to lead a @d to beat this I think|pg||
nt|poohbear: We can certainly make a case for dbling with the East hand over either 1 or 2 @s|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: lots of guessing here, but i think Reynolds will have to place @CQ in West and one honor in @H|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: kudos to Robinson for the pressure bid of 5@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we can see 13 are available, but Lilley will take his time to find best line for TWELVE tricks|pg||
nt|frankaus: Andrew Peake is a well regarded partner, very calm, but often really sneeky, NS a real dangerous opps|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @d lead had been better|pg||
pc|s4|nt|peacokk: Interesting lead|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jallerton: (or let his partner lead a club out of turn)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another solution:)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: and we'll never know if Robinson would have given Delivera a @C ruff against 7@H :(|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
nt|poohbear: now the defense should get their ruff|pg||
pc|d2|nt|poohbear: or perhaps not :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|poohbear: this should make given the luicky @d lie|pg||
nt|poohbear: though now declarer has opened a potential @h threat|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south can count the hand and lead a low diamond now|pg||
nt|poohbear: tricky 2 of @ds might not work so well|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kiwibridge: most would just claim 9 and save time|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pitch hearts|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|poohbear: dunno why he did that|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|poohbear: could play @cs just as easily from hand|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: now - don't even need to guess @H --- well done|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d7|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h6|nt|poohbear: so down 1|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: that will work, but not sure it is best line to guarantee the slam   i was still working thru options :(|pg||
nt|frankaus: David Lilley played in a long term partnership with Ron Klinger - highly regarded, |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mwigor: did EW actually get any tricks?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jbgood: out of the ordinary - i think a simple spade lead is the long term winner|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|djneill: that was a difficult choice of leads - 3-3 in the unbid suits, he chose the @c rather than the 3 good @h|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|poohbear: South might have figured the defense out given he knew the @h count|pg||
nt|poohbear: but a great result for NS|pg||
mc|8|pg||

nt|jbgood: easier for us ...|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm afraid i wasn't following it closely -- did declarer really need the @H finesse?|pg||
nt|frankaus: Zolly Nagy is a real fine declarer and played often with the late Tim Seres|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H|pg||
nt|mwigor: pitch on @c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All 13. 7 spades, 5 clubs, 1 diamond|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you're right -- should be 13 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the women didn't want you Michael??|pg||
nt|mwigor: hi rolan|pg||
nt|mwigor: roland|pg||
nt|mwigor: they kept crashing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lot's of crashes the last 2 days -- yesterday it would kill the whole OZ site|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Yes.  Fredin knew it too, but was able to talk himself out of it...|pg||
nt|jallerton: EW should buy this in 2@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gill made a Lightner double of 7@H which made Hans run to 7N|pg||
nt|keylime:  Dan, if you were to lead hearts for some reason, probably the J@h hits the table?|pg||
nt|djneill: right|pg||
nt|keylime:  2@d the multi here it looks like|pg||
nt|poohbear: catherine|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: looks like EW make 3@D/@H so could be a swing here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jbgood: game on for both sides - even a slam EW:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@s = 8-10 and 3@s|pg||
nt|othered1: I think he had time to play south for 2@H and @DAxx.|pg||
nt|djneill: playing against this kind of multi, you don't worry about the 25+ GF bal variety, what is it like 30-1 odds against?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Lets see how Ebery deals with this|pg||
nt|poohbear: p p |pg||
nt|poohbear: I think|pg||
nt|poohbear: undo Catharine|pg||
mb|d|nt|poohbear: I play 1@s as natural in this spot|pg||
nt|poohbear: and dbl as TO|pg||
mb|2C|nt|keylime:  Here's a bid that depending where one is in the world, it is either very common, or like here in North America, very tightly regulated with prepared defenses required by the pair using it|pg||
nt|keylime:  I think more than that Dan - suspect it's over 40-1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: at least 500-1 against the 25+|pg||
nt|frankaus: Little Old Ladies use it here at most clubs|pg||
nt|poohbear: but they choose to show the overcall instead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2+@C|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kiwibridge: back again|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: dbl for 500?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@H = transfer to @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Easier to find @hQ without that @h10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Delivera PASS??    if not opening weak NT -- why not 1@H [showing 4+]|pg||
nt|poohbear: Gold might just force this to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: RDBL=4+@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but perhaps easts only chance to play against @dQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N then Nagy gets to flip a coin|pg||
nt|keylime:  And here they have changed the regs so that you can not use it at at in most situations; think they tagged a 12 board requirement for acceptable use|pg||
nt|fabsayc: totally disagree with doubling 2h, that should be takeout of hearts|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2NT here should be take out|pg||
nt|othered1: 4-3-3-3 double that most players seem to  make today|pg||
pc|cT|nt|poohbear: yup|pg||
nt|poohbear: get in quick . find a fit. or get out quick|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|poohbear: I would never pass with Neill's hand|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kiwibridge: welcome Raija Davis|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Gary and all kibitzers|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|othered1: aThis could be a problem as dummy isn't entry laden|pg||
nt|xenya: this one could be tricky too|pg||
nt|othered1: do y ou go after @S at once and how?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow -- that took out the entire site|pg||
nt|djneill: South should have bid over 2@s I think, very nice hand for having passed over 2@d and pd spoke|pg||
nt|poohbear: too likely to lose a dbl partscore swing and 7 imps|pg||
nt|othered1: Nor I.  Getting opponents to the 3-level isn't only a matchpoints strategy. |pg||
nt|poohbear: looks like 2@s and 3@ds are both borderline to make|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzey: ew leads are 1.3.5|pg||
pc|d6|nt|peacokk: Isn't Blaksets 5@D strange?|pg||
nt|peacokk: If partner has @C+@H ...?|pg||
nt|poohbear: One thing that a lot of experts do these days is differentiate between 3 and 4 card raises|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|poohbear: I would bid 2NT to show a limit raise + with 4 trumps|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jbgood: Fredin may get endplayed here to lead up from one of his kings|pg||
nt|xenya: can make it double dummy of course but probably that wouldn't be percentage play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Women are playing the same boards as the Open|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  5 McLeish-Bourke  bid & made 6@H  as did King-Neale|pg||
nt|poohbear: reserve the Q bid for 3 trump raises|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jallerton: he needs a @d trick or a 3rd heart|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|poohbear: Declarer wont misguess @hs knowing that Gill cant have 3@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside down count & attitude|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: EW have been pushed up but still make I think|pg||
nt|peachy: the impossible club lead needed to set this, EW did well to compete|pg||
pc|s3|nt|frankaus: t/o of @S common treatment here|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jallerton: not both|pg||
nt|dburn: in isolation, you should play those spades for four tricks by leading ace and another, but the entry position does not really lend itself to that|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|fabsayc: this auction not going anywhere fast so 2@C was fine|pg||
pc|dT|nt|santyclz: Declarer can always make this if he guesses correctly, going to be a slow hand.|pg||
nt|mwigor: interestingly reynolds had to play back a @c there double dummy - i cant work out why|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: stay away from GIB!!!|pg||
nt|mwigor: a @h or @c pitch is fine now|pg||
nt|poohbear: as the opps are disconnected in @cs declarer can make this if he reads the positon|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|nt|jbgood: may go wrong now|pg||
nt|santyclz: (I would make this about 1 time out of 5.)|pg||
nt|poohbear: he can endplay West in @hs|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jbgood: but 300 still chea¨p|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, what with both queens being entries, West would have been fine if he had played ace and a spade, but he could not know this|pg||
pc|s7|nt|poohbear: even if he rises King when West ducks he can exit a spade and score the last 3 @h tricks|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kiwibridge: it was a NT other room, xfer to @H then a backin 2@S stole it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6 nice imps to Gosney|pg||
nt|poohbear: Kanetkar shouldnt have kept his @d king!|pg||
pc|sT|nt|djneill: North here can count 5@h, 1@s, 2@c and can take a safe @d hook (surely opening bidder has the @sK vul|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Richman was going to get @H right anyway|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jbgood: with his balancing 3 @c an endplay like in not unthinkable - and S returns to hand with the red suit that W has discarded from..|pg||
nt|xenya: anyway he is down now|pg||
nt|djneill: if @d hook loses, @s still safe|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: but now has entry to hand via @H ruff|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|poohbear: now just cross to a @h and lead another @s|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jbgood: line..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guess trump by playing @C|pg||
nt|mwigor: @cKQ pitching @d looks right if he plans to play @s to 9|pg||
pc|h9|pg||

nt|jallerton: North's @h did not cost - if he plays a 4th club, declarer ruffs and builds a @d trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: match back to ALL SQUARE --- if it ends this way Konow is in the final tomorrow|pg||
nt|othered1: I've been in worse slams than this one.|pg||
nt|frankaus: EW CC at - http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2010/OpenWom/Lilley-Nagy.pdf|pg||
nt|poohbear: a good result for NS in the other room|pg||
nt|poohbear: not clear to bid 4@h and certainly not clear to make it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: very good, should be down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing South for specifically 3424|pg||
nt|peachy: the impossible. "wrong hand" impossible among other things...|pg||
nt|othered1: a nice little result.  I'd like it better at matchpoints|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphzey: 3nt= good minor preempt ... not a running minorsuit|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 12-14 nt|pg||
nt|jallerton: as the remaining @d were the 4 and the A|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Very true, Jan.|pg||
nt|jallerton: and clubs were 4-4 originally|pg||
nt|djneill: N-S play transfer openings, as if they were responding to an opening 1N almost - 1@c asks, 1@d shows @h, 1@h shows @s, and 1@s is minor suit stayman|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it seems like 4@H can be made|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@d multi. I presume|pg||
nt|poohbear: though might be strong or weak 2 in @h|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which explains the earlier 2h with balanced strong hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: ty Fee|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS 1N=15-"most" 18|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|fabsayc: oops. miscounted|pg||
nt|keylime:  transfer openings and canape it seems too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+   still|pg||
mb|p|nt|peacokk: This is down on a @D lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: Erik, I think 4 NT was always for minors, with another 2-suiter E may double (looks like that is how they play)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=long @D|pg||
nt|mwigor: 1@s is @d or no Major|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|othered1: On simply the @C finesse and no first round ruff|pg||
nt|xenya: is 2@S just spades or a 2-suiter?|pg||
nt|poohbear: whoever said 200 was the kiss of death in MPs  hasnt been -110 very often :)|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: 2@c = majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: just @s|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks|pg||
nt|keylime:  canape for those that do not know, is a method where you bid a 4 card suit, before a five card suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H is much better from north hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: forced by system|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|djneill: North might have been able to double 1@s for takeout (1@d showed @h), but he chose not to, maybe too weak?|pg||
nt|djneill: 2@h was a "cue-bid" likely (getting dizzy)|pg||
nt|frankaus: NS CC at - http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2010/OpenWom/Peake-Richman.pdf|pg||
nt|keylime:  only if S was on a max I would come in to compete in a minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: awkward for South, this - sometimes hard to end up in clubs even when partner bids them, since he might not have them|pg||
nt|poohbear: Or VG operator is Fiona Brown. An Aussie transplanted in England . She is on the English ladies team|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|djneill: West is suspecting the 4-4 @h fit, the singleton @h lead through dummy... getting turned off|pg||
nt|othered1: because of too few major suit cards?|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@c starts invitational auctions|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@d was forced|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: NS plays that north might have only 2clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: Then this hand is a minus for their methods|pg||
nt|dburn: probably, you should play transfers so that South could start with 2NT to show clubs, but...|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 1@c eighter natural or a nt-hånd|pg||
nt|poohbear: so 10 imps to Peake|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzey: but might be a gain because @c K offside|pg||
nt|dburn: ...no harm done here - the methods kept North-South out of a decent slam that was going down, so the methods themselves will not be revised tomorrow|pg||
nt|xenya: EW had a nice save available -- 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the Vanderbilt Final -- with 11 boards remaining the Fleisher [USA] leads Zimmermann [France]  by 14|pg||
nt|poohbear: Gill must have dbled|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: is my guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure why Reynolds would not rebid 1N --- maybe that absolutely denies 3+@D|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@s is very conservative. BUT these guys open very light|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: yes that looked odd|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: even the nice trump holding wont give E 8 tricks here..|pg||
nt|othered1: Do you see any reason for south to continue, unless they may have opened much lighter?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|djneill: shouldn't East have respected West's 2@s? What do you think frank?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or worried about @H??|pg||
nt|poohbear: The reason South didnt open 1@d to prepare this auction is: 1@D shows 5|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|jbgood: and Ace is the texbook lead against a gambling 3 NT - not successful this time|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i bet that's why we have such a small audience|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|frankaus: please note the Open room score is just 1 table of 5, the scoring id done V a mean datum of the middle 3 tables |pg||
nt|fabsayc: the easiest way to combat these artificial openings is to treat as if natural in the suit shown|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and yes in that case pass of 2@S seems correct|pg||
nt|frankaus: i support with 3 in ths sutuation and we pla @S|pg||
nt|poohbear: 10 of @s away from a decent game at imps|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|frankaus: 2@H prob a cue raise with game interest|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: lol nah i was looking up their system notes - sorry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good shift|pg||
nt|ahollan1: presumably 1@S always says  NOT 4@H/@S|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|peachy: another small pickup for gosney|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes, but I'm told this is butler pairs not teams|pg||
pc|h5|nt|frankaus: 2NT is a further gametry |pg||
nt|othered1: But as the cards lie, they needed a @D shift right there to hold it to 3|pg||
nt|poohbear: I have the NS facts wrong. They do open 1@d with 4.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: down only 1 now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|frankaus: but W was not going on|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|nt|poohbear: this is the defense to beat 4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|poohbear: but perhaps they choose this method of dealing with 4-5|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|xenya: they would have probably bid that had W supported -- |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: but declarer can make double dummy|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|d7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|poohbear: perhaps not. Declarer can strip squeeze East|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|d8|pc|sT|pg||
nt|poohbear: making 4 now|pg||
nt|othered1: I have to open south 1@C (and rebid @C over 1@S) since 1@D-2@C rebid is specialized.|pg||
mc|10|pg||
qx|c8|st||md|2SQ75HAJ9DKT876C82,SJ642HT532DJ4CK93,SAK3HKQ864D32CT65,ST98H7DAQ95CAQJ74|sv|o|nt|dburn: interesting choice of opening bid for West|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably better chance at overtrick by playing 3 rounds of diamonds ending in DUMMY  then declarer knows if @D is good or not and might have distribution info to decide about @s ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i guess ok in 3 but position was pretty clear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i just got whiplash|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: just using othertable for comparisons on BBO|pg||
nt|peachy: oh, then who knows at this point.  Nicely judged anyway to stop at 4H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it will be a guide for us anyway|pg||
nt|poohbear: I solve these hands by opening 1@d but thats a personal choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: none of the players will be caught and fined for violating the speedlimit|pg||
nt|dburn: particularly if 1@c does not show clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I think EW plays 1@c as at least a 3-card @c :)|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@c, however, does show clubs|pg||
nt|poohbear: and rebidding @cs|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|jallerton: 2@d Multi includes 3-7HCP weak 2s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 2nt as S|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d = weak major -- 3-7 hcp ... with 8-11 they open 2 in the majorsuit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Robinson didn't have a Weak 2@D mechanism|pg||
nt|poohbear: Im told this is pair based so the team scores arent real|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=ART, 9-14, 4+@H, maybe longer @C/@D, NEG DBL => 4@S|pg||
nt|othered1: That's old-fashioned standard and still right if your @D-@C auctions are natural.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Defense needed to find the @d shift after the first or second round of @hs to beat game|pg||
mb|3C|nt|djneill: that @dA cash seems a little dangerous - what if East has the @dJ and @c are 4-4 then 2NT makes while cashing the clubs then a @h through always sets it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=ART, F, 11+ HCP|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzey: 2@d = 5+@h|pg||
nt|jbgood: N wants to jumpaccept|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@c= majors|pg||
nt|santyclz: Unless on a highway with a minimum allowable speed.|pg||
nt|xenya: i admit 4@C would be the last choce on my list|pg||
nt|poohbear: Gill might check back|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks Rex for this results web site http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/DisplayResultsT5?club_event_id=14747&header=abf&fdc=CXFXBZACG|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: Nagy 1@C=2+|pg||
nt|frankaus: is this the worst 17 ever?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: :) ... but it is not often speedlimit is that low :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: guess 2 NT meant something to that effect|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: we are playing with screens -- and the alerts I make is the alerts and explanations I make is made by W and S|pg||
nt|peacokk: They may play new suit as weak doubleton and 3@H as a minimum 4-card raise?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: is it easy to overtake here?|pg||
nt|poohbear: given these boys opening bid style I find the 3@c bid too aggressive|pg||
pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: indeed, seems can never be right|pg||
nt|poohbear: he has chances for a minor suit slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know the relay structure :(|pg||
nt|mwigor: looks like natural|pg||
nt|othered1: agree, with only 3 trumps. |pg||
nt|poohbear: Gill might well have countered with his hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: game is no bargain tho|pg||
nt|poohbear: and Gos would not have accepted|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzey: the lead of @s 9 is eighter from 9x or 9xx|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: or perhaps 9 |pg||
nt|djneill: KQ tight is a bad holding, berry bad|pg||
nt|keylime:  I'm sure when dummy comes down Nagy will be happy to be playing in a low partial|pg||
nt|poohbear: Partner has not denied 4@ds yet|pg||
pc|s2|nt|poohbear: and has to be mildly worried that a @h lead might set 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: odds shift substantially if partner can have only 11 points, then 4 not safe|pg||
nt|poohbear: this is a coffee break hand now|pg||
nt|peachy: whoa!|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can't be from 9xx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is that allowed?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzey: S explains 2nt as too good for 3@h |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: yes according to cc it can|pg||
nt|othered1: It doesn't seem that west should be essaying state-of-the-match tactics at this point.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lesson here may be  4-small does not a help-suit game try make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and from the sensible side also|pg||
pc|h7|nt|dburn: 12 IMPs to Blakset on 7, where North chose to lead a club against 3NT - conveniently in dummy at trick one, declarer played a spade towards the queen at trick 2 and never knew he ...|pg||
nt|dburn: had a problem|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk4: sorry, this is against NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just looking at EW hands -- i'd be very happy to stop in 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looking at all 4 hands -- i'd be happy to stop in 3N|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: no problem Roland :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: with @s 6-2, I'm wondering if declarer might take an unusual line in hearts - lead 10 from hand|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: richman should either have returned a club or a heart, spades going no where|pg||
nt|djneill: South had a tough holding to lead from - all suits look bad to lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: and that should do it|pg||
pc|h6|nt|santyclz: Don't know about other countries, but in the usa there are highways with a minimum speed of 40 mph.|pg||
nt|jallerton: to pin 9x or 8x in East|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jallerton: playing for @CJ and/or @c10 in West|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW have plenty of time to take their @D trick to go with trump Ace and 2@C|pg||
nt|poohbear: now they play 9 x 16 boards RR|pg||
pc|h9|nt|poohbear: but will carryover from each match they previously played|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 2@C was natural -- remember Peake could have had 4@H & 5+@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pause for questions or is Appleton trying to convince himself to lead his singleton?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: can Peake do anything other than win @S then @D from top?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|hK|nt|poohbear: so effectively 26 board matches|pg||
nt|poohbear: top 3 pairs become Australian team - 2 target events, the PABF (Zone 6) in Hamilton NZ and the Commonwealth Nations Cup in Delhi (just after Philadelphia)|pg||
nt|poohbear: the top 3 can choose whether to play 1 or both events|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D from top or start with Jack or 10?  [to delay finding discards]|pg||
nt|poohbear: this line is banking on the @d onside|pg||
nt|poohbear: perhaps better to try for a @c ruff in dummy?|pg||
nt|poohbear: but declarer was worried about potential @s ruff|pg||
nt|othered1: That would have been my choice|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c2|nt|vugraphzey: but even though I think its slow we are now halfway through this segment ... and they have only used half the time ... so thats ok :)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|jbgood: EW will get 2 trump tricks and a club - just making|pg||
pc|d2|nt|frankaus: this is 3/9 - scores will be posted at - http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/DisplayResultsT?club_event_id=14747&header=abf&fdc=TGUDDXACG|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from top only works if @DQ doubleton|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: ummmm now incredibly lucky Appleton doesn't have 2nd @S|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: curious that both tables had unimpeded auctions to game -- one from EW one from NS|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not so curious -- neither makes|pg||
nt|peachy: switch East's kings, so not unreasonable to try 3NT. However, I would wait for it to be vul|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kiwibridge: NZ trials, also butlers, finished yesterday and the teams have been announced|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|jbgood: even if N guesses hearts W will get a club ruff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's for the PABF to be held here in May|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: NOW @D from top to hopefully keep South off the lead?    nope wrong again Al|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|ralfwil: S will y´take his 9 tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: maybe Peake has longer neck|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
nt|peacokk: Team Blakset beat 4@H on  4 for 12 IMPs|pg||
nt|poohbear: Paul Gosney is missing the White House Jrs in Amsterdam to play this event in Sydney|pg||
nt|poohbear: Must be important to pass up a trip to Amsterdam !|pg||
nt|poohbear: We might ask our VG operator why she isnt in Amsterdam!|pg||
nt|bjurn:  Especially for WHJr, it's a really nice tournament|pg||
mc|9|nt|jbgood: yes, the trump lead turned out better for defense than the club lead at our table|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: a little break here -- toilet I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: players are back --- ready to go again|pg||
nt|poohbear: BTW I would make a Takeout dbl with East|pg||
nt|poohbear: I like to have 6 when I overcall 2m|pg||
pg||
qx|c9|st||md|3SKJT5HA62DKJ987CK,SQ972HKQJT9D4CQ72,SA86H54DAT63CA964,S43H873DQ52CJT853|sv|e|nt|vugraphzey: halfway through this third of four segments|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think both players a bit pushy looking for that non-vul game   but that may be resulting|pg||
mb|1D|nt|fabsayc: likely push here, unlucky slams|pg||
nt|mwigor: 6@h isnt the worst spot in the world|pg||
nt|mwigor: but probably down today|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: In the open room they got to 5@ds on the hand played so nicely here in 3nt.  It wasn't a success.|pg||
nt|othered1: @C lead would have been OK if north had selected the K|pg||
nt|frankaus: the top 3 pairs form the opem team to play at PABF (NZ) and Commonwealth Games (India) |pg||
nt|keylime:  I like six diamonds here but the split in diamonds sinks this without an enlightened guess.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=ART, 9-14, 4+@S, maybe longer @C/@D, NEG DBL => 4@S|pg||
nt|mwigor: EW will get to some number of @s quickly|pg||
nt|poohbear: the other room is starting up . I am moving there Ed|pg||
mb|1S|nt|djneill: 6N appears to be correct since if @d don't break, might get 3@h, 3@d, 3@c and 3@s, while 6@d is very often just down on a bad break, right?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yikes, south giving hints|pg||
nt|djneill: I would not have suspected this Michaels, but N-S play limited openings, where North would open many 9's|pg||
nt|djneill: South is rather sure E-W have slam|pg||
nt|keylime:  That is waving a red flag to a bull I suspect|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: may be just the imfo to bring home 12|pg||
nt|mwigor: probably 3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other option was 2@S=5-9 5/6@S    but never PASS :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=3-8, 4+@S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ralfwil: still much to do in this match|pg||
nt|othered1: See  ya!|pg||
nt|othered1: I lilke the raise on 3 trumps, but it's no everyone's choice. |pg||
nt|zbig1959: .|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: Blakset bid 5@d on   6 in OR - and gave away a tenner|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|ahollan1: i bet some ACOLites would open West hand 1@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: test spades first in 6NT|pg||
nt|frankaus: NS open most 8 counts|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: This can be beaten off the top, of course|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then  1@C-1@H:2@S allows Robinson to describe his hand really well|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ah, so south already knew opponents likely to have slam|pg||
mb|3D|nt|peacokk: Interesting choice of bidding by Blakset|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: red vs white doesn't stop them from jumping early & often|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 790 a nice plus for lilley-nagy|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ralfwil: Why not leave a decision to partner what to do after RD?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Gosney didn't have that problem  Tony Nunn opened SOUTH hand 3rd seat 1@D|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@d seems like the value bid here but he has to consider tht partner may respond a 3 card suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: looks as if all roads lead to Home|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@c said "I have opened light"|pg||
nt|jallerton: with an extra ace, South would pass|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes, but there can still be a penalty|pg||
nt|othered1: But game on 26 HCP is very normal and none seem to have a play.|pg||
nt|dburn: may be harder to beat off the bottom, as it were|pg||
nt|othered1: Hard to come up with a position (@HKQJxx, prehaps) where north must fly with the ace|pg||
nt|othered1: KQ9xx, rather|pg||
nt|djneill: so how would East count out this hand to guess the @d, frank?|pg||
nt|mwigor: this only has 3 losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: at the 1-level when partner can't open the bidding?  Unlikely!|pg||
nt|peachy: i think West is done, in this auction, so cant match|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 4@h on for EW - not easy to bid.. and S makes 3 @s|pg||
nt|mwigor: but doesnt have 9 tricks yet|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm unsure of auctin beginning wiht 3@C|pg||
pc|hK|nt|poohbear: missed a good game|pg||
pc|h4|nt|santyclz: A play on "all Rhodes lead to Rome."|pg||
nt|jbgood: rare that you can play ANY of dummy's 12 cards and win|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If there isn´t - let him still have a choise|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: @s3 said .. I dont like @c ... do you have somethink else|pg||
nt|othered1: Andnow they have to get the @d position right|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
nt|peachy: NS unwittingly (?) found a sac|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S is a good spot|pg||
nt|othered1: And it may be able to withstand a @Dmisguess|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: it was pointed out to me that Robinson could NOT bid 1@C-1@H:2@S  -- that would be a splinter in support of @H|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@S shows 5/5 but peake may do it 4/5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: 5@D looks like Exclusion Key Card   with 5@S showing 1 Key card, not counting @DA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice recovery|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|mwigor: @dJ now for a ruffing finesse is best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lusk was in 4@S from East  -400|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: 9 to play  Fleisher lead over Zimmermann down to 2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ralfwil: Why did he Rdbl?|pg||
nt|jallerton: In case you had the opening values that your had bid suggested!|pg||
pc|sT|nt|othered1: Long hitch by east will made this easier in any case|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mwigor: without a double you almost certainly lose control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Peake can find 8 tricks  it should be a very good score|pg||
nt|mwigor: 8 will score ok|pg||
nt|mwigor: 9 will score very well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assume 4@H [not the non-making slam]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the best kind of save -- contract makes|pg||
nt|mwigor: i think he's just short|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H ruff, @C, @C ruff?  or save @C and just play @D after @H ruff?|pg||
nt|mwigor: @h ruff @d ruff high looks best double dummy|pg||
nt|mwigor: he might play @s to 9|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mrnye: can't go wrong now with the diamonds|pg||
nt|frankaus: nagy one of the best declarers in the country|pg||
nt|mrnye: very costly 2S bid|pg||
nt|keylime:  I think once North follows to the second heart here, it is an near open book in diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually can squeeze north now|pg||
nt|djneill: even a 5-0 break can make 4@d, 3@c, 3@h, 2@s|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|poohbear: Declarer should draw 2 rounds of trump and play @s regardless of the trump break|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|jbgood: now the defense gets a di trick - if he had played on clubs W would have to cash his @d ace to get it|pg||
nt|bjurn:  since 1@C wasnt natural W had a hard time finding a suitable forcing bid|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|jallerton: 1@hx will make here on force of high cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right  small @D ruffed with J does look nice|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: Nagy duck of @CA has givein Delivera some timing problems|pg||
nt|mrnye: yeah i dont think he can quite make it. probably down 2 just before if defenders won ace of spades and played another spade|pg||
nt|mwigor: he had to dscard when reynolds didnt cover i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is interesting give and take|pg||
nt|mrnye: defence cannot afford to overruff here or declarer has control|pg||
nt|poohbear: so much for the @d guess|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Appleton duck of @S looks wrong, @D AFTER playing a round of @S looks wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D pitch from Reynolds looks wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which double negative becomes the positive?|pg||
nt|mrnye: i cant see how bobby can avoid -500 here|pg||
nt|mwigor: i think he was ok if he pitched a @h from dummy after reynolds didnt cover the @d|pg||
nt|mwigor: for +730|pg||
nt|mwigor: perhaps reynolds did in fact cover|pg||
nt|mwigor: ok|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: it makes more sense that he did :)|pg||
nt|othered1: athere's the no sweat overtrick|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: i don't think Ian can make now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nunn led a @S, Hans ducked a @C, then 2 rounds of @H and @C|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mrnye: oops|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kiwibridge: also making X'd|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not quite|pg||
nt|peachy: i think he will be short one|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: y|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|djneill: even if South has the stiff @dJ, South will have no @s to return, so will win anyways|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ralfwil: But I don´t think he will D 1@h on J732|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: sorry misclick|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what??|pg||
nt|mrnye: oh actually he can still make - north is getting strip squeezed if he cashed the king of clubs there then the QD then exited a spade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: surely club first|pg||
nt|mrnye: no good now|pg||
nt|frankaus: somewhere lost the @S pips|pg||
nt|mrnye: yes this is a superior line because it picks up singleton jack with south also|pg||
nt|mrnye: great play from Nagy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now dummy about to be dead|pg||
nt|poohbear: I was just about to say that lack of a @d lead might cause declarer to misguess|pg||
mc|11|pg||
qx|c10|st||md|4S865HJ942D6CAK852,S97HT75DKJT3CQJ64,SJT43HAKQ6DQ8752C,SAKQ2H83DA94CT973|sv|b|nt|dburn: they will do that now declarer has thought about it - if he'd put the queen on quickly, South would have had a real problem|pg||
nt|othered1: That was my thought, too|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Tough times for Konow right now .. lost 33 imps in just 3 boards|pg||
nt|frankaus: VWD - I had a greal confidence in zolly|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@c is still a Q bid|pg||
nt|poohbear: 1@c showed 2 I believe|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C after double should be a cue bid|pg||
nt|bjurn:  it said 11+ any |pg||
nt|ahollan1: very tough --- not sure how much of our pre @S lead analysis was result of seeing all hands :(|pg||
nt|mwigor: when they pass the double you sort of know trumps are 4-0|pg||
mb|1C|nt|frankaus: yes lose lips etc|pg||
nt|keylime:  really no reason to have spoken up there, and 17 imps the penalty for it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=11-14 HCP, if 4@H/@S 11-12|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: I still like their auction -- even if the contract went down|pg||
nt|othered1: West had stayed out of the auction and had great long @H, so maybe declarer can find @D.  |pg||
mb|1D|nt|jbgood: 3 NT seems a sensible contract|pg||
nt|peacokk: Yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: anyone for 1@s opening?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=Acol 2 or better|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: gin for 5@D here chance to score the beer card|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: maybe that covers 8+ playing tricks in @H|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jbgood: Nilsson..|pg||
nt|dburn: still, that was very good bridge by North|pg||
nt|othered1: More like @H and @S length|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzey: Easts Pass denies 3@hs|pg||
nt|jallerton: "denies" is clearly too strong|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: South was told so :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jallerton: maybe he wants to defend 2@cx|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: to be precise ... West told South "normally no 3-card @h" ... sr :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|poohbear: I would rebid 2@c again if able. systemically he might not be able. I hate rebidding 1NT with a small singleton in partners suit|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: on their card it says minimum of 0 but it looks like they open all balanced hands 1C...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C rebid presumably shows non minimum, but in that case i open 1@D if at all|pg||
nt|poohbear: 1@d opener shows 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: 1nt = 11-14|pg||
nt|othered1: some might double on south's hand, but result is likely the same|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C transfer positive?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh 7-9 HCP & 5+@D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@D should be unbalanced, so can be 45 minors (imo)|pg||
nt|poohbear: Gill's hand is worse than it looks|pg||
nt|poohbear: too much @h stuff|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Low@S is the winner here and east found it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: East has no reason to think he will get doubled, and no reason to think 9 tricks will make exactly|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would definitely lead a @c too|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5 card suit and 2 sure entries|pg||
nt|poohbear: rates to be duplicated values|pg||
nt|othered1: right.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peacokk: Looks like +1 to me, 4@H, 1@S, 1@D, 4@C|pg||
nt|djneill: so why not bid 4|pg||
nt|frankaus: the last hand will reach a bridge magazine or 2 i expect|pg||
nt|keylime:  Wouldn't be surprised if it became a Test Your Play problem|pg||
nt|fabsayc: peake has not really shown this strong a playing hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: good start for the defense|pg||
nt|poohbear: this should hold declarer to 8|pg||
nt|othered1: I think the auction says trumps,e ven before you look at your cards|pg||
nt|poohbear: can take 2@d ruffs AK @c and 4 trumps in dummy|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer will try to pitch @s and set up the long @d but I think he gets tapped out first|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jallerton: If West bid 2@d instead of 3@C, that would be non-forcing for many pairs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: the CC only talks about the 2@D/@H/@S responses   2@D include negative AND all 10+ HCP|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|d2|nt|djneill: wow, sold to 4@c in other room, but different auction |pg||
nt|fabsayc: can give up on trump hook now|pg||
nt|frankaus: X and bid is a GOSH here, (G)reat (O)ne (S)uited (H)and|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: Ian thinking    FINALLY a helpful lead!|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hope he claimed the beer|pg||
nt|peachy: lets campaign to get it in regulation, extra points for beer:)|pg||
nt|othered1: trump lead doesn't seem to leave declarer any good play|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jbgood: but alternatives are not attractive|pg||
pc|h4|nt|santyclz: 1@s in most partnerships, 2@d in 1.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|peacokk: +2 now|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugrapha4: very hard with reynolds because he covers his played cards with his hands.|pg||
nt|othered1: Up ace in case south had @D J |pg||
pc|d9|pc|h9|nt|poohbear: defense could have gone wrong by playing 4 rounds of @s|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|s3|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|poohbear: now a @d most likely. Everyone should know declarer's shape by now|pg||
nt|poohbear: Ebery might lead a sneaky 3 of @ds|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer running out of gas |pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|h6|pc|c9|pg||
pc|d7|nt|poohbear: well done|pg||
pc|d4|pc|hJ|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|poohbear: best he can do is try to drop the @d king tripleton but thats impossible on the auction|pg||
mc|8|nt|poohbear: he basically concedes down 1|pg||
pg||
qx|c11|st||md|1ST643H97DAQ63CAK2,SKHAKQ84DJ9CJ8764,SQJ82HJ532D754CQT,SA975HT6DKT82C953|sv|o|nt|poohbear: a Good result fo EW in the other room|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: sorry :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|fabsayc: still he could have made hand|pg||
mb|1H|nt|peacokk: Very aggressive 3@C opening|pg||
nt|othered1: More potential action|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: it is the last segment of the semifinals -- and there are plenty of interesting boards :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice shift from Lilley for the imp|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he claimed it :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: Neill and I have different approaches to bidding. I woulda passed the TO dbl|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: not quite the 5@S 5@C hand we saw a few boards ago|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=9-14, 4+@S, maybe longer @C/@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can E avoid the X|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: Black suit lead would beat 4@h|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jbgood: and a nonaggressive pass by N..|pg||
nt|jallerton: downgrading his side queens.  Many would open 1@H on that West hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is where the old ACOL approach of 1@C then @S @S works much better [imo]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=TRF @H, good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure how that differs from 1@H-2@H = NAT, 6-10|pg||
nt|peachy: If E had used Michaels (if they have it here), he might be entitled to pull, but in this auction, he is cooked and pass|pg||
mb|3C|nt|poohbear: Gosney trating his hand as too good to overcall 1H|pg||
nt|poohbear: treating|pg||
nt|mwigor: 2@h would be a weaker raise to 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|peacokk: They've talked about this surely|pg||
nt|mwigor: sorry 1@h showed @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh now i know -- i translated wrong from CC   2@D & 2@H both transfers|pg||
nt|mwigor: i'll wake up now|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: I would just bid 2@h not 2@c|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can Nunn now match the doubled over :)|pg||
nt|peachy: not too hard to do, but also not unreasonable to just take 10|pg||
nt|poohbear: I suspect that 2@s by Gosney merely shows a 4th @s and not much extra|pg||
nt|othered1: That's an area where there is little uniformity in styles|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|frankaus: zolly will make this i predict|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe north's double replaces @S bid, so south simply raised|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: 2@C is doubious|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|jallerton: interesting opening lead.|pg||
nt|othered1: This may not play very well|pg||
nt|othered1: Is it double-dummy to ruff and lead low @C?  That will make as cards lie, I think|pg||
nt|xenya: suppose declarer ruffs and plays a small club |pg||
nt|xenya: yes, on the surface, there are only 3 losers -- 2 trumps and a club |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|poohbear: this is likely down 2 on a @c lead. Cant see any reason for S not to lead one|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: so he just needs to retain control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: who gets the charge?   Delivera DBL far from automatic   Robinson 4@C very agressive   Delivera 4@S -- can he fathom to PASS 4@C?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mwigor: i'd prefer to bid 1@s the first time with appleton's hand - but obviously their agreements dont allow that|pg||
nt|peachy: Actually, 11 might be coming automatically when he takes club finesse|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|jbgood: anyone for 1 NT on the E hand?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: if he does not, we will ask for undo|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mwigor: it looks like he has just turned a plus (against 3@h) into a minus|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless that is conventional showing something like Michaels |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|jbgood: direct?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Nilsson .....  just told Fredin that he think he made a mistake not bidding 1nt :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: or for N to shift to @s|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mwigor: 2@s should be Michaels|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mwigor: 1@s should be natural (imho)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: keyword = "should" |pg||
nt|mwigor: and imho (in my humble opinion)|pg||
nt|mwigor: others would (and clearly do) think differently|pg||
nt|mrnye: I'm with you michael|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Michael how do you play DBL?   takeout of @S or   showing @H?   |pg||
nt|mwigor: take-out of @s|pg||
nt|mrnye: especially since you know how to play the trump suit|pg||
nt|mwigor: 2@h shows @h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: gotcha|pg||
nt|mrnye: partner puts down xx spade and you'll finesse the QJxx offside easily :)|pg||
nt|mrnye: *onside|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that all makes sense to me too|pg||
nt|poohbear: Defense will get 4 trump tricks here|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mwigor: but then again these guys made stage 2 of the playoff and i didnt make stage 1|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think a low @h was played |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: that's why I voted for 1@C opener -- if partnership allows|pg||
nt|ahollan1: more cost efficient our way Michael|pg||
pc|cT|nt|poohbear: not the king|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|jbgood: :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: Would you have doubled 3@h on the North hand?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|dburn: not sure whether he could have made it, but fairly sure he now can't - credit to Christiansen for not jumping to 4@s (as I confess I would have done)|pg||
nt|othered1: 45-0 run is pretty hard to counter.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: not very often the contract 1@s occurs twice in a row :)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: i mean -- not qualifying for Stage 1|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pc|d4|nt|mwigor: i missed out earlier this year when i got blackwood wrong|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|poohbear: came out the same in the wash|pg||
nt|othered1: They're plus|pg||
nt|poohbear: Result Catherine?|pg||
mc|8|nt|poohbear: ty :)|pg||
nt|othered1: plus NS|pg||

nt|ralfwil: no!|pg||
nt|othered1: OK, I stand corrected, 46|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: but again "actionhand" :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all sets are 16 boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either way -- you would expect defense to the opening to be same as defense against transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|mrnye: little old ladies in australian duplicates regularly play conventions which are not allowed at all in USA which is quite amusing to me|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ralfwil: Partner has passes and I  have only @sA8x|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is it time yet to put this system in trashcan?|pg||
nt|frankaus: if it was cricket EW would be thinking about a declaration :)|pg||
nt|keylime:  the other table sold out their nine card spade fit here|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@h is my choice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hey -- don't blame USA      it's ACBL|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: they keyword is "ladies" who are just smarter IMHO :)|pg||
mb|4C|mb|5C|nt|jbgood: margin down to 7 imps now..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: passed...|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 1@s = at least a 5-card suit :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: I think it's very close - I'm sure I would if partner not a passed hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: rather funny distributions - or? 7 or 8-cards suits en masse!|pg||
nt|keylime:  one more big score and I'd ask for a declaration....|pg||
nt|poohbear: and Gill has a tuff decision|pg||
nt|mwigor: this event is played under different regs to most ABF events i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so not allowed in Canada, Mexico or Bermuda either|pg||
nt|mwigor: i think the keyword is americans ally - although i dont necessarily disagree with you on your main point|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: even a club lead does not beat slam, as the hand with @sA does not have another club|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2nt = invitational + .. at least 4@h|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would dbl as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: but this time the brakes were too good:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 1@s is Walsh ... might have longer @d suit|pg||
nt|jbgood: easy to remember to alert when you actually have a longer @d suit - easy to forget if not:)|pg||
nt|othered1: Right, a lucky grand can generate action|pg||
nt|dburn: but this Danish version of the dealing program may be worth exporting - just been watching a bunch of part scores in the Camrose, so this is a change for the better|pg||
nt|mrnye: the richman-peake system certainly creates swings but they are often on the right side of the swing.|pg||
nt|poohbear: @s suit not good enuff for 3 level overcall|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=9+HCP, 3@H  or   8-9 HCP, 4@H|pg||
nt|poohbear: Kanetkar will need to find a @d lead to beat 5 @s|pg||
nt|poohbear: I suspect Gos is bidding|pg||
nt|othered1: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: S will raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: Now W alerted 4@d --- South hasnt asked --- but at first W didnt alert now he has|pg||
nt|mrnye: it's just something you have to live with when you play these sort of methods - you WILL get some bad results from the system|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 3 @d looks like a minisplinter - and now Søren has some extras for his bid..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I use 2nt different. 2nt is not only inviting , contains also some defensive values|pg||
nt|ahollan1: The New Zealand Trials were held this weekend   Final Results   1) Reid-Newell  2) Grant-Ker   [both fun systems to watch]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hand not good enough for double :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: this wont work out too well|pg||
nt|othered1: distribution could be wilder than this|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|jallerton: the auction has not tempoed well for EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I guess 4@d is cue with @s ... but havent been told yet because South hasnt asked about the bidding yet ... but I'll be back :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: win and play small @H DUCKING|pg||
nt|poohbear: this will be down 1 or 2 depending on how declarer plays @ds|pg||
nt|othered1: i.e., this could be a 2-way game swing|pg||
nt|poohbear: In theory Gos made the correct decision . In practice I dont think so|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|jbgood: 2 @s is what makes|pg||
nt|jbgood: Fredin keeps underleading red aces|pg||
nt|jallerton: South knows that someone is probably void in hearts, so sensibly tries the unbid suit|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure whether 4@h is "last train" or a psychic cue bid, but still all outcomes possible|pg||
nt|peachy: I will need to say good night, past midnight here.  Thanks Gary for having me here, and thanks kibitzers for your comments!!!!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx Raija for coming in much appreciated :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Nunn in the tank?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|poohbear: 3@s may or may not make. If that is what Gill had bid the likely contract would have been 3@s or 3NT depending on Gosney's mood|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like it'll be approximately a push.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|frankaus: plase remember the scoring is V a mean datum of the middle 3 scores from 5 tables  - the score we see is not what the players will end with|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Nunn passes reluctantly|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ralfwil: What´s your opinion Jeffrey, about 2nt inviting? like here or as I play with defensive values (top honours)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure how they choose the 3rd pair for the upcoming NZ hosted PABF|pg||
nt|poohbear: no defense against the minors and partner's " defense" concentrated in the majors|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dburn: probably, though, East will just try for a grand slam and then not bid one|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: noone asked about bidding on my side of the screen -- so the answar my friend is blowing in the wind|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|othered1: How many years does it take till they learn?|pg||
nt|djneill: that last hand it almost felt that South was doubling somewhat just to stop North from competing to 5@h at that vul - since South had about the worst shape possible for a @h ...|pg||
nt|djneill: opening|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: that is not ducking|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|keylime:  playing a swingish system myself Nye, there are times where we go "crap, in std they get there easily"|pg||
nt|mrnye: this works too|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kareno: And my style would be to overcall, not double.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but not as many style points :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|hT|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he'll be happy he did|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s9|nt|santyclz: Lead trump after splinter.  Don't lead singleton trump. Don't lead dummy's long suit.  Don't underlead aces.  Don't lead the suit of a splinter. Time to take a break.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|dburn: well, that may have been Konow's last chance - if they'd bid seven, the outcome would still be in doubt. As it is - well, you don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind ...|pg||
nt|dburn: blows.|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: always in my head newer in my back |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jbgood: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good cash out|pg||
nt|othered1: Michaels to the 4-level at these colors, followed by double, is pretty strong (unless south's pass is considered forcing because ofthe vulnerability)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: Tony Nunn's 3@S call is not the standard treatment.  it seems they play it as too good for 2@S but not game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: default is long spades with not very many points|pg||
nt|poohbear: He must have thought pass was forcing and respected partner's decision|pg||
mc|9|nt|poohbear: If pass WAS forcing then Gill should bid|pg||
nt|poohbear: in my opinion|pg||
nt|othered1: with the void?  surely should if pass was forcing|pg||
nt|poohbear: and prob should bid 5@d|pg||
pg||
qx|c13|st||md|3SAJ8HAK87DQJT2C75,SK954H93D87CQJ962,ST7HJT62DAK543CT3,SQ632HQ54D96CAK84|sv|b|nt|vugraphzey: they are going to play 4 segments with 16 boards each ... the winning team are going to play a 64 board final tomorrow|pg||
nt|jbgood: a boring 4@h - coffee time|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: now a short break -- toilet |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 1-2 minutes |pg||
nt|jallerton: I think there are plenty of ways to raise partner through cue bids, so 2NT is better used as natural|pg||
nt|jallerton: each partnership can work out for itself what 2@C, 3@C, 2@s, 3@H should mean|pg||
nt|jallerton: most important to be on the same wavelength though|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3 of 4 is back -- waiting for Søren|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: here we go again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both in evaluation of the hand [8 losers] and the play  -- but bet Delivera would like his @C9 back|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Richman taking a break|pg||
nt|frankaus: tkx Fiona|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense surely had 8 tricks|pg||
nt|kareno: Then it would be down 5 as declarer could not duck anything.|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: that last hand was what the 4crd majorites love to raise to game on - hoping the opponents will sacrifice|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|nt|poohbear: declarer must have misguessed @ds for down 2|pg||
nt|othered1: So, if we were making up a charge sheet, we'd have to know what that pass by south meant first.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jbgood: a good spade raise?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@h = 3card support and to good for just 2@s |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I guess the convention is called Ostot|pg||
nt|jallerton: I'm a little surprised North didn't open|pg||
nt|jallerton: he can double now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ACOL 2@D before 1@S  ----   there is a large number of 2/1 players who would bid 1@S  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: some will only bypass 4-card @S with 2 more in minor, others NEVER bypass @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I think it is easier to understand 1@S if playing relays, otherwise i'm not convinced [yet]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D    probably not good enough for splinter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially since 2@D not automatic game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 6 to play  Zimmermann 104  Fleisher 88|pg||
nt|djneill: frank does Australia ever borrow gadgets from other parts of the world, I don't see a lot of evidence for it|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@c is 6-9 with 4 card support|pg||
nt|poohbear: bergen raise|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: Richman submarine openers getting weaker and weaker|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless Reynolds opened 1@H :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: In my partnership it was forcing|pg||
nt|othered1: Not mine, though maybe it should be.|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: lots of good stuff comes here from NZ|pg||
nt|mwigor: what was 2@d al?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think South opened 1@H and 2@D same as last hand|pg||
nt|mwigor: ah that makes more sense|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: :) :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Agree jeffrey1 For me a clear opening on N! but if Ps bid is 3@d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d = 14-16 med 5+@h og 4+@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2nt = at least values to game|pg||
nt|poohbear: was 10 tricks there I believe Catherine|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrnye: gill-gosney play a system that you are probably more familiar with in the USA - the Sydney players tend to play more modern methods than the rest of the country|pg||
nt|poohbear: I dont like the 4@s bid. I would make a trial 3@d bid|pg||
nt|kareno: So both souths made the Bergen raise and both norths accepted.  It's hard to judge but 5/5 is a useful pattern.|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: 2@d not transfer |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d is "stayman-like" according to conventioncard|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@s = single @s and maximum|pg||
nt|xenya: well. this may be another chance for Konow -- the dealer is really generous|pg||
nt|djneill: ok nick fahrer, owner of the Bridge Shop, says they play transfer responses to standard @c more often now than before, which is starting to take hold among the top standard players ...|pg||
nt|djneill: everywhere|pg||
nt|keylime:  2@s goes down on a spade lead and continuation comfortably|pg||
nt|fabsayc: down 3 maybe four|pg||
nt|frankaus: i predict - Little Old Ladies will be playing transfer responses in 10 years |pg||
nt|keylime:  I suspect even the ACBL within a few years will allow xfer responses to a standard 1@c|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they already do Dwayne|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ally's sense of humor -- putting commentators on the spot more than we can do ourselves|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe more practical to have them make an occasionally doubled contract in order to get the extra auctions a forcing pass would provide.|pg||
nt|poohbear: We will unofficially go with 10 tricks for the audience|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jallerton: You have to pass.  Opposite a passed hand double 2NT should be scramble|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3NT is interesting opposite a passed hand.  |pg||
nt|poohbear: this does have the advantage of concealment|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jbgood: losing 2 clubs - next!|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 4nt = natural !!!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, what 6 makes game good|pg||
nt|poohbear: of course concealment doesnt help much when the defense has in effect 4 aces|pg||
pc|h3|nt|santyclz: Good bid.  Don't tell the opps anything you don't have to.|pg||
nt|frankaus: i think that they are clearly superior to current methods|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jbgood: game going Stayman |pg||
nt|jallerton: though the @s blockage hinders EW a little|pg||
nt|ralfwil: S has to rely on @c 2-2 - or?|pg||
nt|jallerton: but does he need to knock out @dA first (a card East is likely to have)? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so  2@D=9+HCP, 3@H  or   8-9 HCP, 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: presumably 2N-3@D clarifies|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: (Appleton gave me the abridged version)|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@h would not be everyons choice but it sure worked here|pg||
nt|othered1: I like 3@H, but it's pretty aggressive since south doesn't guarantee 4@H (see @S suit)|pg||
nt|poohbear: Game is just a tad worse than a @h finesse|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn: diamonds? what diamonds?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 5@s = accept slam - showing 2 aces and @hQ|pg||
nt|othered1: did they ever bid @D naturally?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d showed 14-16 hcp and 5+@h and 4+@d|pg||
nt|othered1: ty|pg||
nt|mwigor: 9 easy tricks and a @s ruff for 10?|pg||
nt|mwigor: probably an 11th there if you work at it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems like a non-specific piece of information to gain rather than a long suit [@S] or short suit [@C] game try, but I don't know the system beyond the CC|pg||
pc|h9|nt|fabsayc: they bar my multi but have played them in ACBL events for four years now|pg||
nt|poohbear: Gold would have an easy decline with his pile of trash. ( despite the " 8" points)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|keylime:  I thought that was still Mid-Chart Martin?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe but not enforced in this area|pg||
nt|fabsayc: transfer advances were made legal some years ago in competition|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|poohbear: wow is that the lead?|pg||
nt|othered1: That's one way to give declarer a problem in trumps|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jallerton: or at least slip through 1@D trick|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kareno: I like Barry's suggestion of 3@d as a game try.  At the other table their version did not allow for it.|pg||
nt|poohbear: here we see the value of concealment|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, hello!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bergen simply preempts partner if you don't do game tries|pg||
nt|poohbear: Gosney wanted to set up a @c trick in case declarer had Qx in @h  and Gill thought his partner was angling for a ruff|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 30 minute warning|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|othered1: This looks to be short a trick unless you play @H to 10.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|poohbear: nasty|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|kiwibridge: somewhat more ambitious than 1@S|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C ruff, @S ruff @C ruff --- i like this line|pg||
mc|9|nt|jallerton: he's blocked the @s suit.  Sadly...|pg||
pg||
qx|c14|st||md|4SAJ65H932DJ86CJ42,SKT4HJT64D54CQ985,S97HAKQ87DT972CT3,SQ832H5DAKQ3CAK76|sv|o|nt|dburn: but quite why Blakset did not consider playing in diamonds is beyond me - 6NT was an awful contract, 6@d quite a good one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 overtricks in NT???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: didn't Zimmermann [with an Italian pair] win the Gold Coast Team event?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ralfwil: rightly deserved!|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Blakset seemed to perfectly aware of what North showed -- so he might have had his reasons :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|peacokk: No good layout here for NS|pg||
nt|poohbear: 1@d shows 5|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|vugraphzey: 2@s = 3@ss and 8-10 hcp|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cute upppercut to set 4@H|pg||
nt|poohbear: usually not 5-3-3-2|pg||
nt|poohbear: Gos prob just bids game with his good fitting @d honors|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hard to fault declarer for going wrong there|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=9-14, 4+@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C normal splinter|pg||
nt|mwigor: live in-running scores are available at http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/DisplayResultsT5?club_event_id=14747&header=abf&fdc=XMWBSYACG|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzey: 1nt natural or 5-7hcp with 3card @s support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: passed hand 1N a [very] weak Unusual NT for the 2 unbid suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: never predict|pg||
nt|poohbear: I guess he has seen his partner's openings before|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: and yet another 5@S + 5@C hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: however he should at least try for game|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@c?|pg||
nt|othered1: That's an auction you often lead trumps against, and east may have felt trump leads may pick up more than the loss of the Q.  This was an unexpected side benefit|pg||
nt|poohbear: i like 3@c. Descriptive|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: with four rounds to go after this very close between the top 6|pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugraphzey: 3@h is a semigood heart raise -- N could with a good @h raise bid 2nt|pg||
nt|peacokk: Thx Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: thats what S explains to West|pg||
nt|frankaus: just need to focus on what their suit is not the suit bid|pg||
nt|poohbear: you think forcing Ed?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: möjligen, men @h-vändan såg väl rätt naturlig ut|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: seems this auction could often miss a big @C fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: Sorry the table connected to mine went AWOL - but it wouldnt have been exact results either way|pg||
mb|p|nt|peacokk: good lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: trumps very unfriendly|pg||
nt|jbgood: a good thing that they are split the same way at the other table..|pg||
nt|mwigor: superficially this needs to pick up either @d or @h for no loser|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: remember that ghastly 10 count 1@C|pg||
nt|kareno: A game try is pretty automatic.  You promote for the diamond KQ and the fifth spade.|pg||
nt|othered1: not forcing.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Partner took 2 bids therefore it has to be close to forcing|pg||
pc|c2|nt|santyclz: @s to the ace after that lead?  (Not that it matters this time.)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Sorry folks, have to leave now.  See you tomorrow.|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: bye ... see you|pg||
nt|jbgood: a difficult hand, even after the lead. Needs 2 entries to play club, must be one in spades after three rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|jbgood: so I dont think he can afford a spade to the ace|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I have played against Lars many times, and many times rued the fact that although I can't understand why we lost a bucket of IMPs, nevertheless we did :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Descriptive,  IN my style, 1N doesn't promise anything more than an initial response.|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3NT would go down on 4th best @h lead|pg||
nt|poohbear: or one high one one low one|pg||
nt|othered1: Another auction that says lead trumps|pg||
pc|c8|nt|poohbear: They open VERY light|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: restart is in about 10minutes after this round finishes|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|djneill: may ruff the @c just to cash the @dA|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|henryb:  good morning|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi |pg||
nt|peacokk: hey|pg||
nt|jbgood: a surprise 9 imps on   8 when NS in the CR chose to play @d on 3-2 rather than @h on 5-4|pg||
nt|jbgood: a "slight" misunderstanding ending in a cue...|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: @s 5 or @d 2 seems to be under consideration|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: and now @c 4 too :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: low club was better but west found the play anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this set ends with board 16|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|poohbear: but here he knows that partner is unbalanced as well|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: That's a winning track play.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|mrnye: ruffing the club gives east another trump trick|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 13 minutes left|pg||
nt|mrnye: so probably down 2 now|pg||
nt|mrnye: declarer does best now to start on spades|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: if @h are not 3-3 can he win it then?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: he might play "safe" to get 4 @h tricks .. but thats not enough ... is it?|pg||
nt|othered1: not with the @C marked in south|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the price you pay for light openers|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|xenya: well he can try a @D to the Q now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ralfwil: inte bra!|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|othered1: the 10 is a really interesting play.|pg||
nt|xenya: if it wins, he can duck a @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: now he is forced to play for @h 3-3 .... but I cant tell him that it works and we can go to the next board |pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: sry private|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|jallerton: North might have exploed more with 4@c, but it would lead to the same contract|pg||
nt|othered1: When is the @D10 right and why was that indicated here? |pg||
pc|d3|nt|poohbear: I think he fell off the track|pg||
nt|poohbear: needed to play a second trump and then a @s|pg||
nt|othered1: I think he's still OK|pg||
nt|poohbear: he is going to run into a @h uppercut if one gets pitched here|pg||
nt|othered1: or does @H pitch work out for defense?|pg||
nt|poohbear: He had to play for the mortons fork in @s|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: both women's tables in 4@H, both Open in 6@H|pg||
pc|c5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|jallerton: *explored|pg||
nt|othered1: that's very delicate|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|othered1: I think it's ruff here or make|pg||
nt|poohbear: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton's_fork|pg||
nt|poohbear: there is a reference at the bottom about Bridge|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|c3|pc|s8|pg||
