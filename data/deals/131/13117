nt|eleni: right Thanasi, 6 are there all the time, so let us see if Fotis and Aris will get there|pg||

mb|p|nt|MolvaM: we want slams that make on a finesse, squeeze, throw-in etc|pg||

nt|Gerben42: but can understnad 3NT bid after pd shows my two short suits|pg||
nt|eleni: The boys are not members of her club:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: south hopes that @d finesse is off and everyone else gets a @s lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps S with such good @C could advance with 4@C, but at pairs this seems not that wise|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Thats all for now|pg||
