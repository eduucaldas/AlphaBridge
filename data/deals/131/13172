nt|ahollan1: for EW|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: Richman's submarine opening with @S|pg||
nt|mwigor: note that peake passes 1@h even though he knows his side has a @s fit and not a @h fit|pg||
nt|mrnye: peake is "throwing in an onion" here by passing - he knows the opponent's have game on since his partner has shown less than 15|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|mrnye: so he's pretending to have hearts to make life hard for the opponents - he's happy to take it in 50's|pg||
nt|mwigor: 1@h down any number rates to be a good score|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peake did have option to preempt - but 4333 zero count [yes, i see the jacks] was just too much even for these guys|pg||
nt|mwigor: (undoubled)|pg||
nt|mwigor: i actually dont like his 2@s bid|pg||
nt|mwigor: his side is unlikely to win the hand - and may help opponents evaluate better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in context of his original pass -- he really is showing what he has |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: on the other hand - it could help Richman find a profitable save of 4@S when he holds more shape|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: but I'm with Michael -- that seems quite a long shot|pg||
nt|mwigor: when richman has enough shape for that to be right he probably did more than bid 1@s|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|vugraphzey: 1nt=12-14|pg||
nt|jallerton: a nice close match|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 1@d shows a natural 1@d opening - BUT it is not a balanced hand|pg||
mb|2S|nt|xenya: that was quick|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: hi all... and wlc back |pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody!|pg||
nt|xenya: hi Ed|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: last 16 boards for a place in the final tomorrow|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks precipitous to pass 2@D|pg||
mb|d|nt|jbgood: no problem Jan, you are surely NOT to blame:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: if they need someone to blame then I am ready to be the one -- used to it -- my wife do it all the time|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2nt = 18-19 semibalanced or marmic 4-1-4-4|pg||

nt|vugraphzey: 2@D = @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@c=strong natural @s+@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@h = natural|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@c is optimistic but is makeable|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@s is 4.th suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: Both 3NT and 5@c are sensible contracts.  6@c is indeed optimistic|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: But they are there:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: and 6@c is worse played by South|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: agree. Both jaws is on N|pg||
nt|jallerton: A spade lead looks most likely|pg||
nt|jallerton: forcing declarer to finesse at trick 1|pg||
nt|xenya: best lead -- unbid suit, that simple|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards for all participants are online|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2010/OpenWom/systems.html|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: and an equally quick 2 down i suppose|pg||
nt|ralfwil: too bad communications to aviod tge @s finess|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: EW leads are 1-3-5 against trumph and 2.4. against nt|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the @s finess|pg||
nt|jallerton: It's a shame Roland isn't playing in the Danish Teams.  I'm sure he'd be in this one!|pg||
nt|xenya: presents declarer with a club trick but gains a vital tempo|pg||
pc|s8|nt|santyclz: Ouch, 3nt by s is a lot easier.|pg||
nt|jbgood: and game in @h - one of the denominations available to get the gaqme bonus|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! a typical Roland:)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jbgood: game, actually..|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   lets you watch any/all of the 4 vugraph tables from Australia or the 2 tables of Vanderbilt Final from Reno|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jbgood: may ber duplicated at the other table, depends on the NT range|pg||
pc|h4|nt|santyclz: Easy now.  No longer any possibility of losing 3@hs and a @d.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jallerton: now it all bolis down to how declarer pays the @c suit|pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: remains to unblock now|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Blakset has the @c K in hand|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jallerton: *boils|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jbgood: tu Jan |pg||

pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|h7|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|s6|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: the "team" scores don't really mean much -- this Team Trials is run as a PAIR event|pg||

pc|hK|pc|s5|pc|c4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d3|mc|13|nt|ahollan1: but this way we have one other table to compare actions/results|pg||

qx|o18|st||md|4SHAQJ8DQJ843CQ843,SKT832HKT74DK65C6,SQ96H932DAT9CAK97,SAJ754H65D72CJT52|sv|n|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: do they open 1@D with 4@H & 5+@S?      i know some moscito versions 1@S=@H & @S  and others 1@S=@C & @D [that's what NS convention card says]|pg||
mb|1D|an|!|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=ART, 9-14, 4+@H, maybe longer @C/@D, NEG DBL => 4@S|pg||
nt|mwigor: but he would pass 1@h(X) with most hands with both Majors i would think|pg||
mb|d|mb|3S|nt|mrnye: now THAT is soft :)|pg||
nt|mrnye: I think east has a clear 4S bid at favourable|pg||
nt|mwigor: yeah at this vul the East hand is easily worth 4@s|pg||
nt|mrnye: peake will probably bid 4D here to show his diamonds|pg||
mb|d|nt|mwigor: DBL (assuming its take-out) looks more flexible|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mrnye: I'd prefer 4D since it establishes your canape whereas the double doesn't|pg||
nt|mwigor: true|pg||
nt|mwigor: although it loses @cs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Richman DBL "takeout"   and it seems Brightling has taken up enough room for NS to get tangled up|pg||
nt|mwigor: peake now sort of knows he's in a 4-3 fit with the long hand being forced at T1|pg||
nt|mwigor: which doesnt seem right|pg||
nt|mwigor: so i guess nye is probably right about 4@d rather than double|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room -- Gosney-Gill made what Kit Woolsey calls a "good save"  ---  8@S made!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: i can't imagine 4@D when either minor could be right -- but we really need to know what Peake's other options were [i can't imagine 3N as natural]|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and what Richman's options were -- again, can't imagine 3N as natural|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mrnye: 6C is a reasonable spot looking just at the N/S cards but not good on this layout|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|mrnye: 6C by south is best so the defence can't play a heart through before you set up the diamonds|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: i wouldn't be confident in FIVE @C -- but i'd like being there|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s4|pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Richman's other choice besides original DBL was 2@C, natural & forcing|pg||
nt|mwigor: this is still makable i think|pg||
nt|mrnye: I think he survives here if he plays a club to the queen then a diamond pitching a spade|pg||
nt|mwigor: @c to Q @dJ|pg||
nt|mrnye: but that is the only way|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||

nt|jbgood: 12 of the 14 imps difference was the starting point - as a carry over from a previous encounter|pg||
nt|xenya: well done by NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: ready for actionboard :)|pg||
nt|othered1: This may be fun, depending upon who gets hung first by the misfit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both of these pairs use multi-purpose opening 2-bids -- most everything else is natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lilley-Nagy strong NT  Delivera-Robinson ACOL with Weak NT|pg||
mb|1D|nt|peacokk: EW better stay low on this one|pg||
nt|jbgood: the Blakset lead is a carry over from previous encounter|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: NS playing 5card major and 15-17nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: EW plays 5-card major and 14+-17 nt|pg||
nt|jbgood: if N can get to know that Auken has a 5 card @d suit - difficult if Fredin jumps in|pg||
nt|xenya: we are in for a bit of fun here i think |pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzey: 3@h = 10-12 and 3@s|pg||
nt|jallerton: EW play strong NT, NS play weak NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d = 5+@c and eighter invitational to game or invitational to slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2nt = minors|pg||
nt|othered1: may turn out to be a test of NS's countermethods to unusual NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I guess NS plays 3@c from North = I have my own suit and I want to bid at least game|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@s = I have my @s-suit|pg||
nt|othered1: Most pairs play something along the lines of "unusual/unusual" where minor suit bids distinguish hands with major suit lengths.|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|xenya: indeed -- what should N do now -- would 3@H be forcing -- or should he double or cuebid first|pg||
nt|xenya: so cuebid it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@h directly after 2nt is not forcing -- but 3@c is forcing with own suit - 3@d would have been forcing with @s support|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: maybe 2@h shows a weak NT type hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: sr I cant explain 2@h and 2@s ... South has not asked W yet :(|pg||
nt|jallerton: http://www2.bridge.dk/Systemkort.aspx?ID=375 for convention cards|pg||
nt|xenya: that didn't get them too far, did it|pg||
nt|othered1: if that's a cue-bid, not simply showing @H with game values (my method)|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = FG, 25+BAL or weak 2@H/@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: the double by N paid off|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hmmm in that context, seems 2@S should be weak 2@S opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: 4nt = 1430 |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 5@c = one ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@h shows only 3-card @c ... and a weak nt-hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: I was close!|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: yes ... you are good :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, makes sense -- 3@C shows @Hs, 3@D would show a spade fit|pg||
nt|othered1: On the auction, 4@H is high enough.  With quiet EW's might get quite a bit higher|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: yes and 3@h natural nonforcing and 3@s natural support nonforcing|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: not easy to see how many tricks declarer can take|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: looks like Nagy is using the same Convention Card that I am :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: NS leads 1.3.5.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jbgood: was 4@c just a game force?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 4@c is explained as 2-suiter and GF |pg||
pc|d2|nt|jbgood: a likely 2 down..|pg||
nt|jbgood: the double by N was really a tough bid|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jallerton: maybe direct 3@c over 2@h would have been stronger and he has to go via 2@s to sign off|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|santyclz: Alerted so might be more.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|santyclz: Thanks Jan.|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Peter Fredin is now calling the TD about th first board ... and the TD has arrived now |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Peter Fredin is explaining to the TD |pg||
nt|jbgood: wrong explanations?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|xenya: not that the contract is in any danger but still|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Pip, our vugraph operator gives this table talk    Lilley: sorry pd|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|d7|nt|jallerton: it looks as though declarer will have to fall back on the @d finesse.  |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jallerton: He might be able to make it double dummy with a red suit squeeze against South, but that must be worse odds|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|peacokk: I think it's too hard|pg||
nt|xenya: i can count 11 now|pg||
pc|s5|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|jbgood: i do too|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|jbgood: and the final double may have warned about the bad trump split so much that declarer actually may bet out cheaper than with no opposition bidding|pg||
nt|jallerton: or perhaps even endplaying South with 3 rounds of trumps|pg||

nt|mrnye: yes|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think their system gave them a chance to stay lower, where the rest of the world will open South 2N and no stopping short of game then|pg||
nt|mrnye: yes i expected that south would bid 1nt after the second 1S negative (if that's what it was)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless North extremely pessimistic|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mrnye: maybe bobby chose to show some values because of his distribution and 1s was natural and 4+ or something|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and they actually have more science available after 1N than 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no - i'm sure 1@S is 2nd NEG|pg||

mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|othered1: Steve Robinson -- "always open a 5-card major" -- wouuld approve of south's action.   But most players would open this hand 1@H, if they open at all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S normally 5+ --- but this is great lead director in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|vugraphzey: 2@h= 12-15hcp and natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: if they open with a natural 1-bid, that is.|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|jallerton: trump lead should be on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I guess @c K|pg||
nt|ahollan1: CC doesn't describe the passed hand 2N -- but sure looks like they are NOT playing Drury|pg||
mb|3H|nt|vugraphzey: I got it|pg||
nt|jallerton: did you have inside information, Jan?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: me ... nooo|pg||
nt|othered1: can I assume double was penalty-oriented?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|santyclz: The controversial 3-card raise.  I like it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: the low club lead may induce N to continue the suit.. |pg||
nt|peacokk: Will Konow be able to read @C3?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: W said: "Make some room for these" when he put down the @ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: dbl = penalty|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: but South is a chicken and pull to 3@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW standard signals|pg||
nt|ahollan1: concensus is 2N=max with 3@S    that's the bid that Drury handles with 2@C|pg||
mb|4H|nt|othered1: Trump split doesn't help this, but favorable @H position may be useful.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: some like it, I prefer 4 card raise unless no other bid..|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, all|pg||
nt|xenya: hello again|pg||
nt|othered1: @S position isn't necessarily clear to east.  Couldn't south be 2=5=1=5?|pg||
nt|othered1: Of coiurse, east is thinking about lots more than the play to this trick.|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I have been told that the open room "crashed" -- but now we are back - but this board has been played - and South won 8 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: many lead the second best from a bad suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: NS leads are 2.4.|pg||

nt|jallerton: an overtrick imp for N/S probably|pg||
nt|Walddk11: They placed the tray on the wire and off we were|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 3NT on E looks good|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: good day folks|pg||
mb|1N|an|15 - 17|nt|ahollan1: in ACO, 2@H is just 1-round force|pg||
nt|poohbear: or AKJ109x|pg||
mb|d|an|17+|nt|jbgood: yes - 2 down means the ten - nice defense|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@s = 10-12 and 3@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: suspect we'll see 2@S-4@S|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|jallerton: West is worth a reverse|pg||
nt|poohbear: not sure what NT range EW are playing but I am sure Gill is not evaluating it as weak|pg||

nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: must admit i have never had to defend againt this kind of 2@C opener|pg||
nt|frankaus: this is Match 3/9 to decide the aust open team top 3 of 10 pairs will form a team|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but i would bid 2@S now, a kind of pass the buck bid|pg||
nt|frankaus: many play it here |pg||
nt|poohbear: These auctions are very tuff on the dbling pair. Need very solid agreements as to whats what|pg||
mb|d|an|T/O|nt|jbgood:   1 was duplicated both biddingwise and resultwise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or .... delayed Splinter|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 2@C both Majors is a good method IMO , allows u to bid 2@D with no real preference of 2M with a pref, of 2Nt if game interest or better|pg||
mb|2S|nt|xenya: NS will get the spanking instead i'm afraid|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i would have bid it faster, this slow bid is for sure only a 4 card suit|pg||
nt|poohbear: for instance is this dbl TO or penalty?|pg||
nt|poohbear: of 2@h|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Alerted from both as T/O :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: I guess they discussed this :)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  1NT was 15-17|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a unilateral penalty double in front of the length is so rare as to not be worth using|pg||
nt|poohbear: Gill has to be worried about pushing them to a makeable game|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: with such a sparce hand, i hadn't considered 4@D - especially if EW play that 2@S can be passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: thats why he isnt competing|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jallerton: South may try the effect of @sJ or @SK here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Difficult lead for S|pg||
nt|jallerton: his heart pips do not make that suit attractive|pg||
nt|xenya: @HQ now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: @h Q is taken and put back again|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Jens is certainly thinking about @h Q|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ralfwil: You was right Jeffrey!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in OZ - do your ACOL players say 2/1 is forcing to a certain level, or can opener's rebid be passed?|pg||

nt|vugraphzey: south is thinking.....|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: oh my, derailed now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi Dwayne|pg||
nt|poohbear: as it turns out he cant even make 3@H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jbgood: losing 2 spades and a club|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 club ruffs available|pg||
nt|jbgood: but difficult for N to see?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Everybody agree with 4@h?|pg||
nt|frankaus: scoring is IMPs V a mean datum of the middle 3 tables|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Richman 'sounds like u have a good hand partner good luck'|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|peacokk: Yes, it was|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: imo -- the auction screamed for a trump lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play Weak NT throughout -- so that would NOT apply to 1@S-2x:2N |pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: W needs to learn more about the hand and the @HQ looks fairly safe at this point|pg||
pc|s5|nt|frankaus: of the 5 in play the extreme scores are disregarded in calculationg the mean|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzey: will it be 1100|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Nagy probably thought that Robinson's 4@H was a working @H honor rather than shortness|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: W's heart discards suggested @S values|pg||
pc|c9|nt|keylime:  So, Frank, they are not cross-imped per se, correct?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: E's rather|pg||
nt|xenya: but E has to unblock now to avoid getting endplayed |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I am not absolutely sure if I made a mistake on the last @h play -- It might be that E played @h 8 instead of @h 5 ... sr all if that might be the case|pg||
nt|xenya: is that so obvious?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer can make this simply by splitting out the trumps|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzey: speed up time @cJ :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: obviously Delivera was on same page as Robinson|pg||
nt|frankaus: the match scores shown here are only score between the the two featured matches |pg||
nt|frankaus: no|pg||
nt|frankaus: the datum can be a real wildcard I hate it but what is the alternative?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: i totally disagree with keeping two clubs, what purpose does it serve|pg||
nt|keylime:  Frank, is this the standard method for Australia in choosing a team?|pg||
nt|frankaus: there is a carry forward from the relevant 10 board match played in stage 1|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: unlike the previous 2 boards -- this hand is just a matter of overtricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can but that is also potential suicide|pg||
nt|poohbear: but opts to go for safety first " knowing " the @d ace is onside |pg||
pc|d2|pc|c3|nt|jbgood: i like 4 @h|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d3|nt|djneill: hi all|pg||
nt|frankaus: they alternate  Teams basis one year , butler in the next|pg||
nt|keylime:  evening Dan|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they used to select american teams that way, which sometimes lead to teams where the members where antagonistic to each other|pg||
nt|frankaus: but a lot of politics goes on with the make up of the teams and sponsors will of then hire 5 pros and make up a 6 man team when team bases selection is used|pg||

nt|vugraphzey: 3@d = natural - normally longer @d|pg||
nt|poohbear: 1NT denies 3@h and shows a weak NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: ns plays 1nt as 12-14 in first and second seat .... and 15-17 in third|pg||
nt|peacokk: oh, sorry|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like 3@h is the limit for EW|pg||
nt|jallerton: now West justified to jump to game|pg||
nt|xenya: i've seen people doing that over and over again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gosney only bid 4@C  and Hans-Nunn bid a grand .... but 7N down 1 won't score well at all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@C-6@D:6@H   just maybe |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I don't play hands well enough to be able to afford that|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: duplication is difficult when W opens 1nt in the other room (playing weak nt) :)|pg||
nt|xenya: however that was not to happen -- N doubled in the other room|pg||
nt|poohbear: wouldnt be my choice but might be dictated by system|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would bid 2@c if able|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: remember this isn't really a team match --- the Australian Trials [aka Playoffs] is run as a PAIR event|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|vugraphzey: you couldnt know :)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@c is forcing 2@d .. and now 2@h is invit with 5+@h|pg||
nt|xenya: instead of 1NT|pg||
nt|othered1: Isn't this now cold?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: so -- we only know what ONE of the other pairs has done    there are actually 8 tables in play|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jallerton: South had to lead a @d to beat this I think|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: kudos to Robinson for the pressure bid of 5@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we can see 13 are available, but Lilley will take his time to find best line for TWELVE tricks|pg||
nt|frankaus: Andrew Peake is a well regarded partner, very calm, but often really sneeky, NS a real dangerous opps|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ralfwil: a @d lead had been better|pg||
pc|h7|nt|peacokk: Interesting lead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jallerton: (or let his partner lead a club out of turn)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ralfwil: another solution:)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: that will work, but not sure it is best line to guarantee the slam   i was still working thru options :(|pg||
nt|frankaus: David Lilley played in a long term partnership with Ron Klinger - highly regarded, |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|jbgood: out of the ordinary - i think a simple spade lead is the long term winner|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c5|pg||

mb|p|nt|santyclz: Very true, Jan.|pg||
nt|jallerton: and clubs were 4-4 originally|pg||
nt|djneill: N-S play transfer openings, as if they were responding to an opening 1N almost - 1@c asks, 1@d shows @h, 1@h shows @s, and 1@s is minor suit stayman|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it seems like 4@H can be made|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@d multi. I presume|pg||
nt|poohbear: though might be strong or weak 2 in @h|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which explains the earlier 2h with balanced strong hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: ty Fee|pg||

nt|keylime:  transfer openings and canape it seems too|pg||
mb|p|nt|peacokk: This is down on a @D lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: Erik, I think 4 NT was always for minors, with another 2-suiter E may double (looks like that is how they play)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: On simply the @C finesse and no first round ruff|pg||
nt|xenya: is 2@S just spades or a 2-suiter?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jallerton: 2@c = majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: just @s|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks|pg||
nt|keylime:  canape for those that do not know, is a method where you bid a 4 card suit, before a five card suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H is much better from north hand|pg||
mb|3H|nt|djneill: North might have been able to double 1@s for takeout (1@d showed @h), but he chose not to, maybe too weak?|pg||
nt|djneill: 2@h was a "cue-bid" likely (getting dizzy)|pg||
nt|frankaus: NS CC at - http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2010/OpenWom/Peake-Richman.pdf|pg||
nt|keylime:  only if S was on a max I would come in to compete in a minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: awkward for South, this - sometimes hard to end up in clubs even when partner bids them, since he might not have them|pg||
nt|poohbear: Or VG operator is Fiona Brown. An Aussie transplanted in England . She is on the English ladies team|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: West is suspecting the 4-4 @h fit, the singleton @h lead through dummy... getting turned off|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: NS plays that north might have only 2clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: Then this hand is a minus for their methods|pg||
nt|dburn: probably, you should play transfers so that South could start with 2NT to show clubs, but...|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 1@c eighter natural or a nt-hånd|pg||
nt|poohbear: so 10 imps to Peake|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzey: but might be a gain because @c K offside|pg||
nt|dburn: ...no harm done here - the methods kept North-South out of a decent slam that was going down, so the methods themselves will not be revised tomorrow|pg||
nt|xenya: EW had a nice save available -- 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the Vanderbilt Final -- with 11 boards remaining the Fleisher [USA] leads Zimmermann [France]  by 14|pg||

pc|h4|nt|djneill: shouldn't East have respected West's 2@s? What do you think frank?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|jbgood: and Ace is the texbook lead against a gambling 3 NT - not successful this time|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i bet that's why we have such a small audience|pg||
nt|poohbear: Fiona was so busy reading the press about herself she missed it :P|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|frankaus: please note the Open room score is just 1 table of 5, the scoring id done V a mean datum of the middle 3 tables |pg||
nt|fabsayc: the easiest way to combat these artificial openings is to treat as if natural in the suit shown|pg||

nt|ahollan1: then  1@C-1@H:2@S allows Robinson to describe his hand really well|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ah, so south already knew opponents likely to have slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|peacokk: Interesting choice of bidding by Blakset|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Why not leave a decision to partner what to do after RD?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Gosney didn't have that problem  Tony Nunn opened SOUTH hand 3rd seat 1@D|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@d seems like the value bid here but he has to consider tht partner may respond a 3 card suit|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jbgood: looks as if all roads lead to Home|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@c said "I have opened light"|pg||
nt|jallerton: with an extra ace, South would pass|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes, but there can still be a penalty|pg||
nt|othered1: But game on 26 HCP is very normal and none seem to have a play.|pg||
nt|dburn: may be harder to beat off the bottom, as it were|pg||
nt|othered1: Hard to come up with a position (@HKQJxx, prehaps) where north must fly with the ace|pg||
nt|othered1: KQ9xx, rather|pg||
nt|djneill: so how would East count out this hand to guess the @d, frank?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jallerton: at the 1-level when partner can't open the bidding?  Unlikely!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jbgood: 4@h on for EW - not easy to bid.. and S makes 3 @s|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|poohbear: missed a good game|pg||
pc|c4|nt|santyclz: A play on "all Rhodes lead to Rome."|pg||
nt|jbgood: rare that you can play ANY of dummy's 12 cards and win|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If there isn´t - let him still have a choise|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: @s3 said .. I dont like @c ... do you have somethink else|pg||
nt|othered1: Andnow they have to get the @d position right|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it was pointed out to me that Robinson could NOT bid 1@C-1@H:2@S  -- that would be a splinter in support of @H|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@S shows 5/5 but peake may do it 4/5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: 5@D looks like Exclusion Key Card   with 5@S showing 1 Key card, not counting @DA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice recovery|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 9 to play  Fleisher lead over Zimmermann down to 2|pg||

nt|frankaus: nagy one of the best declarers in the country|pg||

nt|keylime:  I think once North follows to the second heart here, it is an near open book in diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually can squeeze north now|pg||
nt|djneill: even a 5-0 break can make 4@d, 3@c, 3@h, 2@s|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|poohbear: Declarer should draw 2 rounds of trump and play @s regardless of the trump break|pg||
mc|11|nt|jbgood: now the defense gets a di trick - if he had played on clubs W would have to cash his @d ace to get it|pg||

mb|p|nt|poohbear: I would rebid 2@c again if able. systemically he might not be able. I hate rebidding 1NT with a small singleton in partners suit|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: on their card it says minimum of 0 but it looks like they open all balanced hands 1C...|pg||

nt|poohbear: 1@d opener shows 5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzey: 1nt = 11-14|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3@C transfer positive?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh 7-9 HCP & 5+@D|pg||

nt|frankaus: the last hand will reach a bridge magazine or 2 i expect|pg||
nt|keylime:  Wouldn't be surprised if it became a Test Your Play problem|pg||
nt|fabsayc: peake has not really shown this strong a playing hand|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jallerton: If West bid 2@d instead of 3@C, that would be non-forcing for many pairs|pg||

nt|keylime:  one more big score and I'd ask for a declaration....|pg||
nt|poohbear: and Gill has a tuff decision|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: even a club lead does not beat slam, as the hand with @sA does not have another club|pg||

mb|3N|nt|jbgood: but this time the brakes were too good:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 1@s is Walsh ... might have longer @d suit|pg||
nt|jbgood: easy to remember to alert when you actually have a longer @d suit - easy to forget if not:)|pg||
nt|othered1: Right, a lucky grand can generate action|pg||
nt|dburn: but this Danish version of the dealing program may be worth exporting - just been watching a bunch of part scores in the Camrose, so this is a change for the better|pg||
nt|mrnye: the richman-peake system certainly creates swings but they are often on the right side of the swing.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: Now W alerted 4@d --- South hasnt asked --- but at first W didnt alert now he has|pg||
nt|mrnye: it's just something you have to live with when you play these sort of methods - you WILL get some bad results from the system|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jbgood: 3 @d looks like a minisplinter - and now Søren has some extras for his bid..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I use 2nt different. 2nt is not only inviting , contains also some defensive values|pg||
nt|ahollan1: The New Zealand Trials were held this weekend   Final Results   1) Reid-Newell  2) Grant-Ker   [both fun systems to watch]|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|jbgood: 2 @s is what makes|pg||
nt|jbgood: Fredin keeps underleading red aces|pg||
nt|jallerton: South knows that someone is probably void in hearts, so sensibly tries the unbid suit|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure whether 4@h is "last train" or a psychic cue bid, but still all outcomes possible|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@s may or may not make. If that is what Gill had bid the likely contract would have been 3@s or 3NT depending on Gosney's mood|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like it'll be approximately a push.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|frankaus: plase remember the scoring is V a mean datum of the middle 3 scores from 5 tables  - the score we see is not what the players will end with|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ralfwil: What´s your opinion Jeffrey, about 2nt inviting? like here or as I play with defensive values (top honours)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure how they choose the 3rd pair for the upcoming NZ hosted PABF|pg||
pc|s8|pg||

pc|s2|nt|othered1: How many years does it take till they learn?|pg||

nt|jallerton: most important to be on the same wavelength though|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3 of 4 is back -- waiting for Søren|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: here we go again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both in evaluation of the hand [8 losers] and the play  -- but bet Delivera would like his @C9 back|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Richman taking a break|pg||
nt|frankaus: tkx Fiona|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense surely had 8 tricks|pg||
nt|kareno: Then it would be down 5 as declarer could not duck anything.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|djneill: that last hand was what the 4crd majorites love to raise to game on - hoping the opponents will sacrifice|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|an|6 - 9 4+ spades|mb|p|nt|jbgood: a good spade raise?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@h = 3card support and to good for just 2@s |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: I guess the convention is called Ostot|pg||
nt|jallerton: I'm a little surprised North didn't open|pg||
nt|jallerton: he can double now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ACOL 2@D before 1@S  ----   there is a large number of 2/1 players who would bid 1@S  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: some will only bypass 4-card @S with 2 more in minor, others NEVER bypass @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I think it is easier to understand 1@S if playing relays, otherwise i'm not convinced [yet]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D    probably not good enough for splinter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially since 2@D not automatic game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 6 to play  Zimmermann 104  Fleisher 88|pg||
nt|djneill: frank does Australia ever borrow gadgets from other parts of the world, I don't see a lot of evidence for it|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@c is 6-9 with 4 card support|pg||
nt|poohbear: bergen raise|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|frankaus: lots of good stuff comes here from NZ|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Agree jeffrey1 For me a clear opening on N! but if Ps bid is 3@d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d = 14-16 med 5+@h og 4+@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2nt = at least values to game|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mrnye: gill-gosney play a system that you are probably more familiar with in the USA - the Sydney players tend to play more modern methods than the rest of the country|pg||
nt|poohbear: I dont like the 4@s bid. I would make a trial 3@d bid|pg||
nt|kareno: So both souths made the Bergen raise and both norths accepted.  It's hard to judge but 5/5 is a useful pattern.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzey: 2@d not transfer |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d is "stayman-like" according to conventioncard|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@s = single @s and maximum|pg||
nt|xenya: well. this may be another chance for Konow -- the dealer is really generous|pg||
nt|djneill: ok nick fahrer, owner of the Bridge Shop, says they play transfer responses to standard @c more often now than before, which is starting to take hold among the top standard players ...|pg||
nt|djneill: everywhere|pg||
nt|keylime:  2@s goes down on a spade lead and continuation comfortably|pg||
nt|fabsayc: down 3 maybe four|pg||
nt|frankaus: i predict - Little Old Ladies will be playing transfer responses in 10 years |pg||
nt|keylime:  I suspect even the ACBL within a few years will allow xfer responses to a standard 1@c|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they already do Dwayne|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jallerton: You have to pass.  Opposite a passed hand double 2NT should be scramble|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3NT is interesting opposite a passed hand.  |pg||
nt|poohbear: this does have the advantage of concealment|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|jbgood: losing 2 clubs - next!|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 4nt = natural !!!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, what 6 makes game good|pg||
nt|poohbear: of course concealment doesnt help much when the defense has in effect 4 aces|pg||
pc|c8|nt|santyclz: Good bid.  Don't tell the opps anything you don't have to.|pg||
nt|frankaus: i think that they are clearly superior to current methods|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jbgood: game going Stayman |pg||
nt|jallerton: though the @s blockage hinders EW a little|pg||
nt|ralfwil: S has to rely on @c 2-2 - or?|pg||
nt|jallerton: but does he need to knock out @dA first (a card East is likely to have)? |pg||
pc|cA|nt|dburn: diamonds? what diamonds?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 5@s = accept slam - showing 2 aces and @hQ|pg||
nt|othered1: did they ever bid @D naturally?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d showed 14-16 hcp and 5+@h and 4+@d|pg||
nt|othered1: ty|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they bar my multi but have played them in ACBL events for four years now|pg||
nt|poohbear: Gold would have an easy decline with his pile of trash. ( despite the " 8" points)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|keylime:  I thought that was still Mid-Chart Martin?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe but not enforced in this area|pg||
nt|fabsayc: transfer advances were made legal some years ago in competition|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|jallerton: or at least slip through 1@D trick|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|kareno: I like Barry's suggestion of 3@d as a game try.  At the other table their version did not allow for it.|pg||
nt|poohbear: here we see the value of concealment|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, hello!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bergen simply preempts partner if you don't do game tries|pg||
nt|poohbear: Gosney wanted to set up a @c trick in case declarer had Qx in @h  and Gill thought his partner was angling for a ruff|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 30 minute warning|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|othered1: This looks to be short a trick unless you play @H to 10.|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
nt|poohbear: Gill prob thought that his partner would cash the @h unless he knew it wasnt cashing. However if partner wanted a @c ruff he should win the ACE of @hs and then switch|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|nt|dburn: well, you have a spade to the 10 in reserve, I guess|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that's as mini as it gets -- and with singleton King --- YUK [just my opinion]|pg||

nt|fabsayc: remember that ghastly 10 count 1@C|pg||

nt|santyclz: Sorry folks, have to leave now.  See you tomorrow.|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: bye ... see you|pg||
nt|jbgood: a difficult hand, even after the lead. Needs 2 entries to play club, must be one in spades after three rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|jbgood: so I dont think he can afford a spade to the ace|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I have played against Lars many times, and many times rued the fact that although I can't understand why we lost a bucket of IMPs, nevertheless we did :)|pg||

nt|peacokk: hey|pg||
nt|jbgood: a surprise 9 imps on   8 when NS in the CR chose to play @d on 3-2 rather than @h on 5-4|pg||
nt|jbgood: a "slight" misunderstanding ending in a cue...|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: @s 5 or @d 2 seems to be under consideration|pg||

nt|mrnye: for declarer|pg||
mb|d|nt|mwigor: hi all|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mrnye: i guess one of the downsides of the peake-richman method is that it is difficult to know when to double in this sort of auction - neither player knows how weak the other is|pg||
nt|mwigor: yes richman's hand had more defence than it might have|pg||
nt|mwigor: after peake's double (of 4NT) its probably up to bobby to double the final contract|pg||

nt|poohbear: 3@c seems very dangerous|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@h|pg||
mb|4C|nt|henryb:  that is a brave balance|pg||
nt|jbgood: Difficult for Konow to win this board - but may get a push|pg||
nt|mrnye: I dont like the 1nt bid by andrew here|pg||
nt|mrnye: opposite a favourable 1S overcall you are just asking for trouble|pg||
nt|mrnye: richman could be overcalling many 6-7 counts here|pg||
nt|poohbear: not sure what Gill means by it|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@h was bizarre.  Was it meant as a transfer? cuebid?  Why not bid his second suit?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all pass is possible|pg||
nt|poohbear: I can ask his sister . She is in the audience and an Australian internationalist .|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: was 1nt perhaps alerted as hearts, else this is insane|pg||
mb|4D|nt|jallerton: Well you have worked hard for it today.  Enjoy!|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 5@h = 2 aces an no @sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk11: Pharmaservice by 4 IMPs with 4 comparisons to come in the other semi-final|pg||
nt|Walddk11: Two very tight semi-finals|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Tomorrow we start at 9am -- looking forward to seeing you all then :) |pg||
nt|Walddk11: And the bridge has been very good most of the time|pg||
nt|othered1: With lots of exciting hands and, accordingly, chances to misjudge things.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Sghe says this is why she has played with Peter once in the last 30 years :) ( OK just me kidding :))|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N!|mb|p|nt|mrnye: 1nt should show 11-13 or so in this sort of auction|pg||
mb|5H|nt|jallerton: a play problem to end with then|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: still.  South has to lead something|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: if this wins the match is all square|pg||
nt|poohbear: now slam in @cs|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|jbgood: the step - balance sure is breave:) |pg||
nt|poohbear: the hard way|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: that lead helps declarer more than the @h selected in the other room|pg||
nt|poohbear: ok this is a wrap for now folks|pg||
nt|poohbear: back in an hour|pg||
nt|poohbear: Thanks Fiona . Great job operating|pg||
nt|poohbear: one point of play|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: nice defense!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes and thanks to all the usual suspects|pg||
nt|poohbear: @ss can only be picked up in one direction|pg||
nt|poohbear: so ace first is the right play|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|jallerton: he can now count 12 tricks if @s are 2-2, but can he make it on 3-1 spades?|pg||
nt|Walddk11: Thanks all, see you tomorrow|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk11: Bye for now|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: bye|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: and sleep welle|pg||
nt|othered1: Thaks all and bye!|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not any more however|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jbgood: and the balance was not found at the other table|pg||
nt|djneill: the @h situation is probably marked here - East showed 4, and West let the @hK, unlikely West would lead from a doubleton King knowing the opponents had 7 of them, unless it was KQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not that clear from lead, but is strange defense if nagy has the queen|pg||
nt|keylime:  I duck because I really have no compelling reason to cover here|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jbgood: bye all - see you in an hour or so for the next 16|pg||
pc|c3|nt|poohbear: cant pick up 4-0 in south|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: if the match ends "all square" after the last 16 boards tonight, then Konow will earn a place in tomorrows final |pg||
nt|jallerton: might try @c finesse now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jbgood: 9 imps with 2 sessions to go|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: still need to play 32 boards in this semifinal ... see you all later|pg||
nt|jbgood: bye all|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|mrnye: east may find the play with QTxx though since he knows south has two good diamonds and that the heart is his only possible entry|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|peacokk: Not the best line |pg||
nt|jallerton: now needs @s 2-2 or possibly @SQ singleton|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzey: see you all in one hour|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c6|nt|mrnye: would be a great defence from nagy - i wouldn't put it passed him|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
mc|13|nt|vugrapha4: Gold asking what 3H meant - 'natural' |pg||
nt|poohbear: back in an hour|pg||
nt|poohbear: thanks everyone|pg||
pg||
