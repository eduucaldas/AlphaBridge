mb|2H|mb|p|nt|han: 4SX might be -500 but can be -800 if the defense manages to play trumps quickly enough|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|han: what's double here?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|han: is it "please bid 4H if you have hearts"?|pg||
nt|han: or is it just penalty|pg||
nt|sybarra: Berten's had a great hand.... yikes that is over the top..|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@H on a minor suit squeeze?|pg||
mb|p|nt|han: no chance on this lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: not after this lead|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sT|nt|fann4: I think 6@H was a great bid, though it won't make.|pg||
nt|hedyg: i agree Jeff|pg||
nt|han: west plays 5-6, high-low would not be asking for a ruff but would be suit preferenc|pg||
nt|han: e|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sybarra: no cost to leading another club is there?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|han: so 5-6 should ask for a club return|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d7|nt|hedyg: it was a pretty good slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: just wrongsided|pg||

nt|hedyg: well if not the @Cs certainly looked better|pg||
nt|han: south showed 4+ hearts and dummy has 1098|pg||
mb|p|nt|han: not a great suit to switch to|pg||
mb|1N!|an|9 - 11|mb|p|mb|2C!|an|Lavings|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|han: he didn't know that one club trick was enough, then he also needed spades to split 3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: in @H he needed 2 finesses , in @c just 1|pg||
nt|han: but he could combine chances, hook heart, cash AK of clubs, if queen drops, test spades and if they split he doesn't need the secondheart hook|pg||
nt|hedyg: and then 1 of the black suits to come in|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d9|nt|sybarra: well 3 @C  is better that 4 sp (I think) |pg||
pc|dT|nt|hedyg: pull AK@S before @d ruff|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|s4|nt|helene_t:  difficult to reach 2@h playing standard methods. E might want to bid 2@h over 1NT but for most pairs that would show extra values|pg||
