nt|janm: games, though - you need a lot of luck to come back from a big deficit, so it's right to bid as if you're going to get the luck|pg||
nt|janm: Is Makaruk really thinking about punishing his opponent for balancing by bidding a game? If he does he'll be disappointed to find that he has 3 quick losers|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: perhaps pressure of thinking opps are going to bid the aggressive game causing him to think?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|janm: Even with the disastrous slam off AK of hearts, though, NS have a pretty solid session and a very comfortable lead, so shouldn't need to push|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: 18 EW played 5C X -3 so 9 to hans  137-72|pg||
