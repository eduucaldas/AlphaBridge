nt|poohbear: DAVID . Which is Bob and which is Shane?|pg||
nt|lc: Shane is named for Jill's Dad (Steve Shane).|pg||
nt|bobh1: another non-relevant deal ostensibly|pg||
nt|lc: Is this bridge, or a soap-opera?|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|poohbear: All my Squeezes:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|lc: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|vugraphzpt: Nice bid 3@S encouraging 3NT|pg||
nt|lc: In this auction, East's 3@D is more of a "courtesy" raise.  Because 2@S is availbale as a better raise.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpt: Shane telling pepsi exactly that|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lc: So, it was a bit optimistic to go on over 3@D, but youth....   and lure of VUL game.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Thank you says papa|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|poohbear: I am not sure why Bob didnt respond 1@s  . Dont think they play flannery|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|poohbear: They do play Flannery|pg||
nt|lc: So, it seems there is just a bit too much work for declarer here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Low diamond may havee been better if Pepsi doesnt split then move to spades|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s4|nt|lc: He has to knock out 3 key cards (a @D and 2@S) -- but defense will set up @C in time.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bobh1: he has some nice spots to work with|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|lc: It would be better if he had some more HCP to work with.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lc: Pepsi will be pleased to find Lev with the @C9 -- a key card now.|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes 2 @cs and 3 winners for them is too many |pg||
pc|h2|pc|c7|nt|lc: If declarer had the @C9 it would be much better for the offense.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Should Lev have played the @C9 here to help partner|pg||
nt|lc: YES.|pg||
nt|lc: I think so --|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: For the reason now|pg||
nt|lc: Now, Pepsi doesn't know where the 9 is.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: And is thinking|pg||
nt|lc: Dangerous to continue @C since declarer could have the 9.|pg||
nt|bobh1: seems strange not to with 987|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I think the @C7 is a lazy card but can probably afford it on this hand|pg||
nt|lc: The 7 is unreadable -- whatever their carding.|pg||
nt|poohbear: photo of Junior & Lev  http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/webcam/1/table1.jpg|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Bob B looks like a man with @CA-Q-9-x|pg||
nt|lc: Sure, they can still survive even if Pepsi switches horses now (couldn't resist that after the Derby taljk).|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Junior on right if that isn't obvious|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Left sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: even confused me|pg||
nt|poohbear: no running scores for security reasons|pg||
nt|lc: Part of "correct bridge" is always helping your partner. Lev failed here.|pg||
nt|lc: Although, even the @C9 might not have been perfect...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: And that is why Pepsi is in a quandary (dont you like that word)|pg||
nt|lc: It is the card he would play with 9x remaining (current count).|pg||
nt|bobh1: as you say tho they will recover even if he switches|pg||
nt|poohbear: and I am sure there will be a barrage of Polish under the screen regardless of the result:)|pg||
nt|lc: So, maybe we are being too hard on Lev.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Whatever he couldashoulda woulda played I reckon he has absolutely denied the @C9|pg||
nt|lc: Well, he wouldn't play the 9 from 9xx remaining.|pg||
nt|lc: Normally, in this situation, North would play current count on the @CK.|pg||
nt|bobh1: if he shifts to a @h say and then declarer tries a @s from dummy surely lev will hop|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: why is partner playing the king - most likely and i know in this case he doesnt from K108xx|pg||
nt|lc: Discarding the @C9 on the @D might have been a smart idea, too.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Ah now we are getting down to some  bridge logic|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lc: All Lev ended up doing was wasting 3 minutes.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Again thinking if partner has the @C9 then I want him on lead for a spade so play the 10|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
nt|lc: still no 9 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: And even now he didnt put his partner out of his misery|pg||
nt|bobh1: lev is stubborn|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h4|pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||
nt|bobh1: declarer will try the @h hook now|pg||
nt|lc: Now the @H finesse and down many.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: so -2 methinks|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Caressing the @H7|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bobh1: you like that word don't you?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lc: He carrasses and Pepsi massages?  How do you decide which, David?|pg||
nt|bobh1: you massage trumps and caresse in notrump|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Bob has more class|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Bob thinking aboutt just cashing out because hedoesnt know if clubs are 4-4 or 5-3|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lc: It really isn't going to matter if he finesses or not.  All the same 7 tricks, it seems.|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|c5|mc|7|nt|lc: He gets 2 more regardless.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Good board for P&L|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|lc: Surely, no game will be bid on this one.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|poohbear: Cavendish slams always make tho|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Pepsi played with Lev long enough not to get too excited|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: As Victor silverstone suggests Pepsi and Lev building a nice sessions here|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: usually a good idea not to get excited with 4333|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lc: Bidding 1@S (East) implies @D length. Not a flat hand.  Thus, Shane's 3@D bid.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: What is best here - win and play heart heart or win in dummy and pass spade|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Clearly thi line best of both worlds|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lc: Sorry, stuck in a hillarious private discussion. Urging the perpetrator to go public with it.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|d7|nt|vugraphzpt: Promotable trump now|pg||

nt|bobh1: unfortunately meaningless in this context|pg||
nt|lc: All these partscore hands are great news for Levin-Weinstein.|pg||
nt|lc: Surely their huge lead is safe on this set of deals.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Not that any sort of hands would have made much difference|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|lc: They had, in effect a 100-IMP lead  (like being up 100 in a knockout match with 27 deals to go).|pg||
nt|lc: Although, they could have have a -50 set, and some other pair a +51 set.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|poohbear: only 2 or 3 pairs had a big enuff score to do that|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|poohbear: others would need + 60|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: And, that won't happen on these deals, it seems.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bobh1: lev might have considered 3@c instead|pg||
nt|lc: But, still very big $$ for 2nd, 3rd, etc.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: If partner has clubs that will be beneficial|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|lc: Although bridge players love winning, this is one event where 2nd or 3rd isn't so painful.|pg||

nt|bobh1: when I'm 6-4 i like tomention my second suit if convenient|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|c6|nt|lc: Sure, me too.|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|lc: Or, 2NT is available.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Nice spade queen by shane|pg||
mc|8|nt|lc: I would play that as 4@C and longer @D in comp.|pg||
nt|lc: I think 3@D a poor call.|pg||
nt|bobh1: maybe 2n is some kind of good/bad in this situation|pg||
nt|bobh1: altho doubt if lev-pepsi play that|pg||
nt|lc: I don't think this pair plays G-B.  If so, then 3@C.|pg||
nt|lc: Either way, I think it poor to treat North hand as just @D.|pg||
nt|lc: Is Pepsi yelling at him?|pg||
nt|bobh1: some are suggesting 1n by pepsi|pg||
nt|lc: Sure, I can live with 1N by Pepsi.|pg||
nt|lc: Going minus on this board -- although not a big deal, could end up costing them as much as 20-30 thousand dollars.|pg||
nt|bobh1: anyway we're making a mountain out of a molehill here|pg||
nt|lc: Since I was asked, here is how the $$ work...|pg||
nt|bobh1: unfortunately, all the bridge gods are giving us are molehills|pg||
nt|lc: Every pair was auctioned off.|pg||
nt|lc: The top pair (Levin-WEinstein) sold for $61,000.|pg||
nt|lc: The person that paid the $61K "Owns them."|pg||
nt|lc: If they win (and they will), the prize is something like $280,000.|pg||
nt|poohbear: 214000|pg||
nt|lc: OK. We are in a poor economy this year.|pg||
nt|lc: Last year it was more.|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, usually the owner sells out pieces.|pg||
nt|lc: The pair themselves usually own at least 10% of themselves.|pg||
nt|lc: Also, there is a pLAYER's pool -- prize money only for the players|pg||
nt|po-s: is it official how much the bought back?|pg||
nt|lc: Not the owners|pg||
nt|lc: I don't know how much of themselves L-W own. I'd guess 15% each or so.|pg||
nt|lc: Just guessing.|pg||
