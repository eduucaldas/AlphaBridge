nt|vugraphzpt: Standings at http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/2009/PAIRS1S.htm|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: And imagine what it is like for poor humble VG operators|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lc: So, we start with a 1N-3N, I think -- although I suppose 4@H at a few tables.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: With the mirror shape, it wouldn't be good to play in the major, here.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|lc: However, the @H suit is laid out in a way that either game can make.|pg||
nt|lc: Declarer has to guess in @H -- AFter @HQ, low, low, low...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is there ANY 4-3-3-3 shaped hand where you would investigate a major after partner opens 1NT, Larry?|pg||
nt|lc: He has to decide whether to play the @HJ next or a low one.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Scattered values. I have  recently done some simulations and it is generally right to play 3NT unless there is a channce of a 2-2 fit in a suit which there isnt here|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lc: I am unlikely to use Stayman with any 4-3-3-3- --- right|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|lc: Here, declarer will likely drive out the @CA first.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: even 5-3 fits same analysis|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|lc: Hold up twice in @S, drive out @CA and later face the @H decision.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lc: And, I think he rates to guess @H correctly.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What about 5-4?   Suppose partner is allowed a 5-card major for 1NT (as most do) ... worth looking for THAT fit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Logic dictated that wasnt worth my CPU wokring overtime|pg||
nt|lc: I believe he will guess correctly, because most Wests would cover the @HQ with !Kx.  But with @HKxx they wouldn't cover the first one.  So, I think Gitelman will play @HQ, then @HJ|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h2|pc|c2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|lc: Also, he has another reason to guess @H correctly...|pg||
nt|lc: He knows East has 4@S to East's 3.  And @C look to be the same.|pg||
nt|lc: That points towards @H10x with East as more likely than @H10xx.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I do love hearing from people but the results can be found at http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/2009/PAIRS1S.htm|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You've put the pressure on him|pg||
nt|lc: So, this is my first bet of the night.  Fred--don't let me down.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|h6|pc|c9|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Cant go wrong now|pg||
nt|lc: Hmmm.   Now he can't go wrong.  We'll never know.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Shame for Fred, because no doubt, he was going to squash that 10|pg||
nt|lc: Eisenberg had a guess, I suppose and chose wrong.  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Eisenberg is a party pooper|pg||
nt|lc: Yes, I don't think it would have mattered.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Due to security for this big money tourney the boards are only loaded 3 at a time so the table will close and reopen after each round|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Hmm says Fred|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lc: So, +400 for N-S will be a small pick-up.  I'd expect at least 80% of the field to bid and make a game here.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|bjacobs: Is it cross-imped?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|lc: Yes|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
mc|9|nt|bjacobs: So the good news is you can pick up 100 imps on a board.  The bad news is you can lose 100 imps on a board|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Yes against other 23 tables|pg||
nt|lc: Or 250 Imps on a board :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: 100 imps is only 4 normal imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: so a vul game swing can be 12 x 23 = 312|pg||
pg||
qx|o2|st||md|4S5HT83DQ863CJ8632,ST7HA9762DKT2CAT9,SKQ63HKJ5DA954CQ7,SAJ9842HQ4DJ7CK54|sv|n|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: A heavy weak !2S, for sure.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lc: 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: NS better watch out here|pg||
nt|lc: At favorable, this is about 11 points more and 1 @S more than Marty Bergen would have.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: They mayy be playing 8-11 and a weaker 2@D weak two bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Norwegian style|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: 2NT is ALWAYS natural when opps open weak 2.  (Many of my students can't seem to get this.)  NOT for the minors.|pg||
nt|lc: In direct seat it is about 15+ - 18+   In balancing seat, about a KING less.  But still natural.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: OK 23 x 12 = 276|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: We agreed yesterday that my maths is less than perfect|pg||
nt|lc: Only time it would not be natural is by a PH  (Like :  P  P  2@S  P P 2NT)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lc: So, this looks pretty ugly.  (An oxymoron).|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Ah indeed cant play multi so it is as larry says a very heavy weak 2 bid esp NV|pg||
nt|lc: Multiple 100'sm it would seen.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I hope you arent watching the webcam when you say this looks ugly http://www.cavendishinvitational.com|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They say "no double no trouble", but even here, the undoubled undertricks probably means, oh, I don't know, a -500 imp swing?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|bjacobs: A mere fleabite|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lc: I think at most tables it will start 1@S P 1NT P 2@S P ??|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: We could be discussing an intra finesse if there was an entry to the table|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: The cards seem mildly favorable for a pushy E/W 3NT|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe double dummy defense can do better, but normal for Goldberg to clear @S.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzpt: Eisenberg and Goldberg are a house pair to ensure even number - not in auction pool|pg||
pc|h6|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c4|pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|nt|bjacobs: But to continue Larry's auction 1@S P 1NT P 2@S P ...  I would think perhaps 2NT - Pass?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lc: Incidentally, E-W are a "House Pair" -- they weren't auctioned off.  Just filling out the movemnet.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
mc|4|nt|lc: Yes, Bill -- I think 2NT-P.  So I would expect 2NT to be the most common contract.  But for E-W.  Not for N-S as we are watching. :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: That was Eisenberg who claimed|pg||
pg||
qx|o3|st||md|1SAKT3HQ2DJ95CK943,S97HJT96D7643C852,SQJ842HK3DAQT8CJT,S65HA8754DK2CAQ76|sv|e|nt|lc: "Curious hand," says Oscar the Owl.  A Notrump game for E-W no matter who plays it.  (400)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I am told that Kit Woolsey at the other table responded 2@H ... probably true to his style of a non-forcing 1NT?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpt: Conservative pass by East|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lc: This looks like the flattest deal of the night to me.  420 at every table.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: There is no guessing needed and nothing to the play or bidding.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Right - just 20 imps if you can get an overtrick?|pg||
nt|lc: I would never predict a truely flat board at the local duplicate, But...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: You could on a good day sneak through a heart and pitch one on a  diamond|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose an overtrick is vaguely possible.  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: very vaguely ...|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lc: Even if you sneak a @H, when you lose the @D finesse, they cash out.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Scores http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/2009/PAIRS1S.htm|pg||
nt|lc: Let me go out on a limb and say 420 at every single table. Maybe for first time in Cavendish history.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||
nt|lc: At that same website, the board-by-board details are available (after the session). So, I'll look it up.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is this recorded somewhere?  Looking forward to you eating humble pie ...|pg||
nt|lc: Yes. It is recorded.|pg||
nt|lc: Honestly, I think it a stupid prediction. Someone will screw it up.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Anybody that predicts a flat board over 24 tables should not consider  a career as a bookmaker|pg||
nt|lc: How about all 420's and all 450's.  That's my final answer.|pg||
nt|lc: You are right.  I want odds. |pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: 7/5 against there being 24 420's|pg||
nt|lc: Need more :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looking at this field, it does seem unlikely that there will be anything other than 420s|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: ok 6/5 - seeing you are not odds savvy|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps a pair or two misscoring as 620 ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Not posssible bridgemates|pg||
nt|lc: :)  Computer would catch that.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh bridgemates ... the odds change ... someone clicks in 11 tricks by accident|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I was aked why the makeable contracts cannot be programmed into bridgemates so that it can query the players if in fact the scores they have entered are correct|pg||
nt|lc: Reasonable idea.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's right, and if you key in -1100, it can respond: "you idiot"|pg||
nt|lc: Since we will be with N-S all night, I'll give some personal info...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: semed stupid at the time but.....|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|lc: South, Brad Moss, is from a very prolific bridge family.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|lc: His Mom is Gail Greenberg, one of the best women players with multiple-World-Championship wins.|pg||
mc|10|nt|lc: His Dad is Mike Moss (also in this event).|pg||
nt|lc: Brad has won several National Championships -- |pg||
nt|lc: And has been partners with Gitelman for about 10 years now.|pg||
nt|lc: North, Fred Gitelman is surely well known to the viewers...|pg||
nt|lc: He is the man behind the show you are watching.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Connie notes that must have been a thrilling round for the VG audience|pg||
nt|lc: He started out small in the 1990's -- everything was free --|pg||
nt|lc: A small piece of trivia: I was the first ever "customer." |pg||
nt|lc: Fred called me for the test and asked me to pick an ID. I chose LC.  Got it before anyone else could -- now there has to be LC1, LC2, etc.|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, Bridge Base grew and grew -- and now is the main on-line playing site.|pg||
nt|lc: Of course, the VuGraph shows enhanced the popularity.|pg||
nt|lc: With the multiple daily small-fee games, Fred has done quite well in building this business.|pg||
nt|lc: West, Billy Eisenberg is a multiple-time world champion --|pg||
nt|lc: One of the great American players of all time. Quite flamboyant, too. A fun guy.|pg||
nt|lc: Connie Goldberg has won the J.R. Teams (the prelimanry event at this tournament) -- and has been good friends with Billy for quite some time.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The house pair seem to be running 3rd - is that allowed?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: closing and reopening|pg||
