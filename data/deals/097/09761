nt|petergill: Joe Grue is in his mid 20s, the possible heir apparent in American bridge. His partner Curtis Cheek is a bit older - they won the Reisinger a couple of years ago, and won the 3rd ...|pg||
nt|petergill: session here, to move up to 16th. This is Session 4. |pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I am very impressed with table manners of Grue/cheek|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzpt: Now that Joe has left youth world|pg||
nt|petergill: A good play. |pg||
nt|petergill: If South rises with the ace, can 4@H be made?|pg||
nt|petergill: It's tempting to play @CA - @SJ doesn't look like an entry. |pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: After this round I will hand you over to Cata Bathurst (nee Robles) to finish the session. Tomorrow's session - final 9 rounds will start at 09:30 PDT 12:30 EDT 17:30 UK 18:30 ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Europe and a miserable 02:30 Australian Eastern time|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Krekorian in tank big  time|pg||
nt|petergill: Souyh thinks: where are declarer's point for his opening? 1 in trumps, none in diamonds, so does declarer have bare @CQ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: May make if he rises as diamond will go off on club and lose just 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: Jim Krekorian takes his time when he has a problem - he is trying to work out which play will guarantee beating 4@H. |pg||
pc|cA|pc|h6|nt|petergill: Exciting now. |pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Someone suggests: why if W has Q of club he would not play the @CJ - but this is wrong as this exactly the situation where he would play the jack|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzpt: Cheek must not cash club prematurely|pg||
nt|petergill: What can South work out from declarer playing off @HA = perhaps that declarer has another entry to dummy, thus has @SAKQx(x). I'm not sure if that logic holds up|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I dont think he has a problem if he wins this in hand then plays heart wins next spade in dummy and ruffs a club|pg||

pc|d6|pc|c6|nt|vugraphzpt: He can endplay Krekorian with the  last heart to lead clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: what does GIB say|pg||
nt|petergill: He plans to endplay South to dispose of his @D loser later on the club |pg||

nt|vugraphzpt: I am told GIB said 4H would make even if south didnt rise with club ace|pg||
nt|petergill: No need to discard the diamonds earlier - that could wait. |pg||

pc|d6|nt|vugraphzpt: I am asked: Could u all comment on:  Doesn't it skew the results by having leaders and top contenders back into viewgraph theater?  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I cant really see what the question is asking. These players are totally unaffected by VuGraph having played at this level|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
nt|petergill: Other BBO table: Bobby Levin led @H9 against 1NT - interesting to see the style of the "pair of the moment"|pg||

pc|c8|nt|petergill: Levin - Weinstein won the Cavendish earlier this year with Jacobs - Katz and the Egyptians, so their success extends beyond the Cavendish. |pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Not Cavendish peter |pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I think you mean US Nationals|pg||
