mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|lc: So, maybe we will get to see 1@C P 1@H as a transfer. (but maybe North gets in).|pg||
nt|lc: So, no transfer with the overcall.|pg||
nt|lc: Note:  In normal bidding, a NEG X of a 1@D overcall guaranteed 4+ 4+ in majors.|pg||
nt|lc: So, a bid like 1@S here need not promise 5.|pg||
nt|petergill: If you watch the Swedish Junior match betwen our rounds, Iceland Juniors includes the Swede Cecilia Rimstedt, who looks like http://www.worldbridge.org/people/pe...|pg||
nt|petergill: rson.asp?qryid=17703 and is the current World Junior Pairs Champion|pg||
nt|lc: BUT -- after a 1@H overcall (specifically), a 1@S bid does promise 5.|pg||
nt|po-s: Peter has another double named after him. Opponents were in 4 spades (his suit). He doubled and they ran to their laydown club slam|pg||
nt|lc: In std, that is.  Whatever standard means these days.|pg||

mb|4D|nt|lc: Without even clicking the link, I'll bet it is a prettier picture than some of the fat, bald men we;ve seen.|pg||

nt|petergill: 4@D preempted EW out of, well, nothing|pg||
nt|lc: So, 4@D was based on an expectancy of 10 trumps, I suppose - but there are only 9.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|lc: I guess he'll make it for 130 -- nothing special.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|lc: Doesn't have to guess @HQ since @S pitch.|pg||
nt|petergill: On Webcam1, you can see Bjorn Fallenius, who now,lives in USA, and Thomas Bessis from France. Thomas is the young one, in his mid to late twenties. |pg||
nt|lc: So, he'll make 130, but some other N-S pairs will be collecting multiple 100's |pg||
nt|petergill: at http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/webcam/1/table1.jpg|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lc: Are we allowed to show men that aren't bald, gray or fat?|pg||
nt|lc: or old?|pg||
nt|lc: I think Europe is doing a better job than America of getting younger players involved.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|lc: Although, ACBL is trying hard.|pg||

pc|sT|nt|lc: There are just so many things to compete against -- video, electronic, etc.|pg||
nt|petergill: The results of the first two sessions are at http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/ then Session Information, or in Saturday;s Daily Bulletin from the same website. Today's scores ...|pg||
nt|petergill: are not yet on the website. |pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|lc: Not sure what 3@H means.  2@C likely conventional.|pg||
nt|petergill: America's new School Bridge League in my opinion is the greatest idea for youth bridge promotion in the history of bridge. And I think Patty Tucker in Georgia is doing a terrific ...|pg||
nt|petergill: job in youth bridge promotion. So I disagree.  |pg||
nt|lc: THere isn't much about that West hand that suggests a jump!|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|lc: Yes, Patty if doing great --  we need more Patty's!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: So, a snoozer since the @HQ is coming down.|pg||
nt|lc: otherwise, dec would have to deal with the @S10 to make his game. Here, it will just be for an overtrick.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lc: Now the @HQ is really coming down!|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|lc: So, declarer will just make some sort of @S guess and make 420 or 450.  A dull flat board.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lc: So, maybe I can tell more jokes.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|lc: Fallenius runs a bridge club in New York City. He is very well liked. |pg||
nt|lc: (Not easy for a bridge player to be liked by almost everyone).|pg||

nt|petergill: school activity as school sport currently is. To achieve this aim, they use activities such as bridge, which teaches respect, trust, partnership and the like.  Email me if you want ...|pg||
nt|petergill: to know more. Enough of my hobby horse. |pg||
nt|lc: He lost 3 @S tricks?|pg||
nt|petergill: School|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Most in field will open with West in 3rd seat Fav.|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Yes, he made 10 tricks|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lc: Surprised to see Fallenius pass.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lc: In fact, I suspect the field action to be a weak 2 in @H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: North played @S6, not @S10, on the spade from dummy, I think|pg||
nt|lc: Which may buy it  (P P 2@H P P P).|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|lc: Now, surely Fallenius will balance.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Yikes!!!|pg||
nt|lc: Bjorn -- did they forget to give you bidding cards?|pg||
nt|lc: I am shocked.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lc: I'd expect 99% of the room (at these colors) to balance.  No?|pg||
nt|petergill: The Americans will tend to open 2@H in 3rd seat, and some of the Europeans (e.g. the Italians) 1@H in 3rd seat. |pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, balance seems normal|pg||
nt|lc: Please, somebody tell me I'm not losing my mind.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lc: It pains me to no end to let opps play on 2-level wiht 8 trumps.|pg||
nt|lc: Especially if I am white and have easy way in.|pg||
nt|petergill: On webcam, Bjorn looks a bit bored|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lc: I'd be bored, too, if I had to defend 2@S.|pg||
nt|petergill: at http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/webcam/1/table1.jpg|pg||
nt|lc: That looks says, "I hope Larry isn't doing the VuGraph, because he will kill me for selling out."|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|lc: And, I don't care what the result is, or what would have happened if he balanced.  I just couldn't live with myself.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|lc: 25 years ago, Zia told me, "Larry, the biggest part of bridge is pushing the opponents from 2 to 3."|pg||
nt|lc: And he is right.|pg||
nt|lc: I'd rather go for 1,100 than 110.|pg||
nt|petergill: Current standings this session - alas we have no info - scores at the start of the day can be found at http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/ then Session Information|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|lc: I will be very upset if this goes down.  :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Fallenius might be a believer in the need to balance more against 2@H (two level still possible) than against 2@S. |pg||
pc|s4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d5|pc|s7|pc|h5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|lc: Not only it down, but down 2.|pg||
nt|lc: Okay, Fallenius is a genius, and I am now suicidal.|pg||
mc|6|nt|lc: This is enough to make me give up bridge.|pg||
nt|lc: But, fortunately, I am giving up bridge. :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Ok ill be back soon with rd 26|pg||
nt|lc: story here : http://www.larryco.com/OldNewsletters/09Apr.htm|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: We will have Wolpert Korbel|pg||
nt|petergill: Fallenius is not a fallen man- perhaps he only balances when 2@S is making.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzps: closing table now|pg||
