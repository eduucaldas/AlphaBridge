nt|Walddk2: 2@C alerted because it does not have to be a suit when you play 2/1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT is forcing for one round|pg||
nt|henryb: semi-forcing 1N, and Bramley pays the price for playing "Bart"|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|henryb: 2@d would show five hearts or various other hands|pg||
mb|3D|nt|henryb: maybe completely forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: So, East has to play one level higher than many pairs would.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes|pg||
nt|henryb: Of course some would play in 2@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You don't get anything for nothing, so if you want to play "Bart", you can't stop in 2@D|pg||
nt|brolucius: South does best to start with the @HJ, hoping to make two hearts, two diamonds and a club. But declarer can dispense of a club loser on the spades.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/Bart.html|pg||
pc|h5|nt|henryb: me, I lead the @hJ, but what do I know|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|brolucius: Normal to lead the @HJ from !J-10-x-x- against a suit contract. That's because the third round is likely to be ruffed by someone (not here, as it happens) and you want your honors ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: to contribute to the first two rounds.|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: Was impossibler for Fredin to read the low heart, so he rose with the ace. However, Bramley could have come to 9 tricks regardless|pg||
nt|brolucius: No good, is it, when the ace goes up and declarer makes the king and queen. Much better to lead the jack to alert North to the position.|pg||
nt|henryb: North forgot to apply the rule of 10, which would have told him that declarer had only one card higher than the 5|pg||
nt|henryb: rule of 12 rather|pg||
nt|brolucius: Might declarer not have the 10 as his high card?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/2009/PAIRS5O.htm  for standings after session 4 of 5|pg||
nt|henryb: we all know the rule of 11; but when you play third and fifth if partner leads third best it is the rule of 12; if fith best the rule of 10|pg||
nt|henryb: He could, but the suit has already been blown in that case|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe there was no rush to hop the ace at IMPs, but Fredin did non like the sight of the spade suit in dummy|pg||
nt|henryb: understandable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At MP you would have to rise|pg||
nt|brolucius: After the defenders had blown the heart suit, declarer had no need to seek a discard for his club loser.|pg||

nt|henryb: do you bid with E?|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Borderline, but I think I double|pg||
nt|henryb: assuming you play Lebensohl, you could plan to bid 3N over partner's 3@d|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, the A-Q is worth an A-K over the vulnerable bidder.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South passed.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|henryb: no Catalina, you missed a pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Passell passed?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Playing Lebensohl, 3@H would show around 8-10 but would not be forcing. Passell rated his hand as too good for 4@H.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: Two obvious losers, this won't take long|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Some players use Kokish, rebidding 2@H on 26 points balanced (or hearts). |pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb: Moss and Gittelman are having their troubles this round: 1N down 1 on board 4; and now in 6@h on board 5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They make life simple, David|pg||
nt|brolucius: Then after 2@S (relay) - 2NT (25-27) you have the space for Stayman and transfers.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Clubs are very friendly, so this will not cause Fredin much sweat|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||

mc|10|nt|Walddk2: We will shut down shortly and load three new boards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's how it works after each round of three boards|pg||
nt|brolucius: These three weren't very good!|pg||
