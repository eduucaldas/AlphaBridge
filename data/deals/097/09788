nt|Walddk4: Martin Garvey I should have said instead of David Edwin twice|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Roger Bryant|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: Closed Room NS sort of stole this|pg||
nt|henryb: Hello all|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: in closed n/s allowed to play in a nt|pg||
nt|mariner1: and aggressive N or S could save this|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Hi all I thought David had a twin :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: This event is always one of the most thrilling on the calendar to play in|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Its also the most tiring|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you live on adrenalin for four days|pg||
nt|ady: quiet part score to start       though Alfrey has entered with a chancy 1NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: they 'd better run :)|pg||
nt|thegarve:  By Tuesday players are tired and there's only a few pwople in Straford and the atmosphere is a lot quieter|pg||
nt|bobholl: but where to :)|pg||
nt|ady: but run to where|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but e/w can make upto 3s|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 1n has 7 tops|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: perhaps neither e or west has quite enuf to enter auction|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Henry|pg||
nt|viren169: Despite their seed... they have been the main favorites throughout the event...|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 @D or 3nt ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Let´s say 300|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: will suffer here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if they run form 1Nx, they will end in something else doubled |pg||
nt|thegarve:  last Year at breakfast on Tuesady and before play commenced you could see it in the faces of all the players|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: you don't really need much from partner for game|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: even on a @H lead 3NT is "cold"|pg||
nt|sharkey: no - Erichsen keeps it simple |pg||
nt|henryb: really? |pg||
pc|cK|nt|mariner1: well a push and out|pg||
nt|viren169: either 3@D or 3N works here...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|thegarve:  I would have bid Stayman as East and we may have ended up in 2DX|pg||
pc|c5|nt|henryb: how would you avoid losing 3@h, a @d and the @sK?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6 @D 1 @S 1@H but collect all ??!|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 @C |pg||
nt|bobholl: even 2 @S|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|thegarve:  as West|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|h2|nt|viren169: Not sure taking the A was right at trick 1...|pg||
nt|athene: this does the defence's job for them|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: we can see that there is nothing to the hand 1n with no overtricks|pg||
nt|athene: but it wasn't a trivial declarer problem|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: looks like might get our for -300  |pg||
pc|s7|nt|sharkey: not sure I understand @H play|pg||
nt|athene: if he just played on diamonds he is cut off from his @CA|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|athene: and it's very hard for the defence to return the suit declarer attacks|pg||
nt|viren169: was afraid of the heart switch... and ended up playing heart himself!|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|c4|nt|henryb: he needed a 9th trick before he set up 8|pg||
nt|athene: so the heart play was a mixture of @HA right and south not returning a heart if it was wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We lost the open room I'm afraid. Last year was a disaster as far as connections were concerned. Let's hope for better luck now (bad start one has to say)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h9|nt|werge: Did´nt they have 500 during the play - strange to discard a @s from dummy|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: cl|pg||
nt|bobholl: well  it worked :)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h7|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: so can declarer|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: certainly the 1NT response would normally deny four hearts but south will look silly winning @HA and returning @HJ if declarer has @H10xx|pg||

nt|mariner1: in Closed Room I meant 3@S jammed|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: 6s not vul doubled is 800 against 1370|pg||
nt|sharkey: appears NS can make 3@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: preempt in @C ?|pg||
nt|werge: Yes, I think so|pg||
nt|werge: 1 @H from South - or?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  leaning oevr Robson's shoulder to see the play can be hard work|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: too good for a pre-empt|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: but im not expecting par to be reached on this hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 NT |pg||
nt|ady: an easy 11 tricks in hearts here for n/s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, his shoulders are higher than most people's |pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk4: Open room is up again|pg||
nt|thegarve:  looks like a solid vul weak two|pg||
mb|5D|nt|xenya: 2@S might not be enough to stop NS|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|mariner1: I think they find slam now|pg||
nt|lestergold: should do easily now|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3s succeeded in stopping them in closed|pg||
nt|xenya: are we sure 3@D shows a strong hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: its amazing that can make so much difference|pg||
nt|mariner1: it would to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: on eextra level removed|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: clearly NS play double of the artificial raise as t/o of clubs - not showing diamonds|pg||
nt|henryb: I would bid 3@h as South, but 2@h certainly worked well|pg||
nt|sharkey: why not 1 NT with West's hand - 8-10 balanced i presume|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: Network a bid dicky, so fingers crossed today!!|pg||
nt|bobholl: which is  good :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|werge: Never - with 40 % of your values in side suits...!|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|athene: most expert pairs have some sort of agreement here but it's easy to have misunderstandings|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh well|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3d doesnt promise a strong hand but northn now knows that he is enormous with all his cards in his partners suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3h a silly bid|pg||
nt|werge: Even 63 %|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: he has |pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: his pard has shown 9 plus car5ds  in the minors- either game in a minor or slam surely |pg||
nt|viren169: when you have a gadget in your kitbag... I guess you just have to use it!|pg||
nt|thegarve:  only 50 in 4@S so maybe a swing|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|lestergold: 3d is inadequate if al you are going to do is sign off in 3n after ur pard has shown some values|pg||
nt|ady: seems the re-bids vary after 2NT force     some play 4@H minimum   which seems to fit with souths hand|pg||
nt|werge: 4 @S might go for 500|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|henryb: I would certainly play it takeout of clubs|pg||
nt|thegarve:  500 i mistyped |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|viren169: Nothing wrong with Nick Irens!|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: at end of the day both players have failed to show partner anything like their full assets|pg||

mb|p|nt|snorris: 4 @hs or 4@s ? that is the question|pg||

mb|1N|nt|snorris: right|pg||
mb|3D|nt|snorris: dont expect them to bid it|pg||

mb|d|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|snorris: and 5 @d is to costly(800)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: and zilch in the majors|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mariner1: S 1@S will stop EW|pg||

nt|viren169: looks like all the way!|pg||
nt|bobholl: pressure bid always good |pg||
nt|viren169: nice bid!|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D looks the normal action|pg||
nt|henryb: I think it depends a little on whether 1@d promises 4 or could be 3. |pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 @C ruffs are enough and simple to accomplish|pg||
nt|werge: On a !-lead, 3 NT depends on the right fines - but with @C 4-4, you can afford a wrong guess |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: and the "sactifice" makeable to boot!|pg||
nt|sharkey: now underbid...|pg||
nt|bobholl: +1 now :)|pg||
nt|henryb: If it could be 3, perhaps a little more restraint|pg||
nt|athene: goodbye, @H loser|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|lestergold: should be held to 2h|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually an interesting position because a trump trick can be promoted here|pg||
nt|mariner1: a @D lead allows N to ruff a @D|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, it can be set|pg||
nt|lestergold: however hard for defence to get that second trump and also enjoyn an ultimate diamond trick|pg||
nt|viren169: not the best of leads... but a tough lead to find from that collection... |pg||
nt|werge: @c-lead|pg||
nt|ady: another routine hand in 3NT   n/s      hardly swingy hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well what a lead|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|ady: well unless you play AK spades before in case of queen doubleton and then finess heart you will make|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: must ash spade ace and then play second club|pg||
nt|xenya: but it's not over yet|pg||
nt|lestergold: far from ove|pg||
nt|lestergold: to beat this is almost double dummy defence|pg||
nt|xenya: in practice, E needs to cash @SA now|pg||
nt|lestergold: because dummy has to be cut off|pg||
nt|ady: now no problem|pg||
mb|p|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|h7|nt|lestergold: see above i said that already|pg||
nt|werge: Suppose, you "know" that @c´s are 5-3, you might try Ace-king of @S and then the @H-finesse|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|thegarve:  no smith peter so a @C switch|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sharkey: in view of the fact you're prepared to sacrifice in 5@D - if opps bid game - you may as well bid it right away.  And, as in this case, the bonus is you make game|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
nt|athene: a trump lead was a possibility on west's hand, but he has all the entries and only one trump, so it's not likely to be that effective - leading a trump doesn't usually achieve much ...|pg||
nt|athene: unless the defence can get a second (and maybe third) round led|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: it might be safe, but little more|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bobholl: too late :)|pg||

pc|c3|nt|lestergold: also not easy to reach|pg||
nt|bobholl: very sound "weak" two|pg||
nt|viren169: solid weak 2!|pg||
nt|thegarve:  I thought a bid of 4@h is a transfer to 4@s|pg||
nt|werge: Yes, but South did´nt know that|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: yes, double-dummy you finesse the @H10, throw @C on @HQ, ruff clubs good|pg||
nt|athene: but in the real world you probably do normal things and make about ten and half tricks|pg||
nt|viren169: Irens will be happy with 11 tricks... now probably 12|pg||
nt|henryb: with the @c lead it is easy. on a @d lead not so|pg||
nt|athene: yes, diamond lead should kill 6@S :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: if he ducks the @C more (6)|pg||
nt|athene: he might go up with the @CA perhaps?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very dangerous to bid with the South hand, but, as we can see, sometimes it is dangerous not to |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mariner1: well now a @S lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: 29 combined points anbd stops in all suits bhut 3N breakable n unlucky sort of hand|pg||

pc|h3|nt|lestergold: theyll never get above 3N i predict|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: northn wont want to bid skywards!|pg||
nt|lestergold: south will feel secure with all those points|pg||
nt|viren169: Back to 10 tricks...|pg||
nt|athene: scared of @CK, @C10 back ruffed, @HA, @C ruff|pg||
nt|henryb: on the other hand it would be silly to duck the @c if it is a singleton. that would be the only possible way to go down|pg||
nt|bobholl: is the best in imps i think :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however 1@H-4@H is usually limited - but West may not be |pg||
nt|ady: this should be down 1      n/s can make 4@S   on double finesse of spades   with diamonds 2-2 to allow entries    unlikely to reach it even with a free run|pg||

nt|henryb: the fact that North led a club significantly increases the chance that it is a singleton, and you are offering 13 to one that it is not if you finesse|pg||

nt|thegarve:  need some tolls over a 3NT overcall|pg||
nt|werge: Brave man in North - it pays, probably|pg||
nt|thegarve:  best to play 4M/5m as suit constructive and 4D as a s/o in a suit or both minors|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S    might make slam difficult     Robson requires top cards and no wastage|pg||

mb|5C|nt|lestergold: well 3h may well make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H OK but better to be conservative with 3 small. partner might have a really good hand and overreach over 2H|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N has a shot here|pg||

nt|marlowepi: it is for EW|pg||
nt|bobholl: 10 tricks scores 400 than |pg||
nt|viren169: Pass?!?!|pg||
nt|athene: but one or two (or more) tricks often get lost in practice|pg||
nt|werge: The previous|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: another possible slam     but a poor one|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  sadly his Times column has been extracted fromthe online version of the times from 04/05/09 onwards together with the chess column - you have to buy the paper instead|pg||
mb|2H|nt|werge: In fact, South having opened, this is a very good slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 3 @C probably if they play 2@D as 7-9|pg||
nt|henryb: will S bid 3@d or 3@h|pg||
mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: it looks to me like you need a lot more than just one of two finesses|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: I think with a really bad hand he should bid 3@d|pg||
nt|viren169: No need for Mossop to bid 3@H over a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: why play a 5-5 when there is a 4-3 available :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but partner very often has 44 high :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: N-S may have explicitly agreed to emphasise majors when they make these t/o doubles (see board 2) - that seems to be fairly common|pg||
nt|werge: Why not 4 @H?????|pg||
nt|werge: From West|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: what will W lead?|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@H looks better than 6N |pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: He may not be on lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, passed partner - you can understand it |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: i mean the doubler is emphasising them|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mariner1: well E on lead anyway|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he meant, if W leads out of turn, what will he lead?|pg||
nt|mariner1: no 3N could have been in S too here|pg||
nt|werge: West has an ENORMOUS 1 @S-bid|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: I like 2NT better than 3@C when in a game-forcing situation. 2NT = club stopper, 3@C = 4th without a club stopper|pg||
nt|marlowepi: was just joking, nobody had bid NT yet when Rob said it|pg||
nt|henryb: but this choice has led to a much more difficult contract|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: Both unlimited since South already forced to game|pg||
nt|viren169: hearts 3-3 looks all is safe and well...|pg||
nt|bobholl: but if @H 4-2 :)???|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think it's all that safe and well, is it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: very quiet here, as declarer thinks, but we occasionally hear some thumps from a ladies' aerobics class in another room|pg||
nt|henryb: could you move the video cameras in there? please!|pg||
nt|athene: declarer somehow has to draw trumps and withstand a club attack|pg||
nt|viren169: Dont tell the players... they will all want to join that class!|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: 35 mins to go before I turn ugly, announces the TD|pg||
nt|athene: the TD turns into a pumpkin at 12?|pg||
nt|viren169: too late for 35mins!|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|thegarve:  when they leave the table to score up - the observers will assume that there must have been two passed out baords|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: soem would be more hesitant to reverse with the S hand. depends on how high reverse is forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If a jump shift isn't game-forcing, bridge becomes too difficult|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: 4252 is a bit directionless as to strain, so some would rebid just 1S to conserve bidding space, thinking that if N passes, unlikely a game will be missed|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|thegarve:  first blow to Mossop team on board 1 5 IMPs|pg||

nt|henryb: trying desperately to give a sluff-ruff, but the enemy is not cooperating|pg||
nt|bobholl: you know difficult it is to be operator :)?|pg||
nt|bobholl: how|pg||
nt|viren169: We are really grateful!|pg||
nt|ady: if you assume all 16 missing points with south then the slam good    otherwise  poor|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: very serious problems, yes|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps the important issue for south in the bidding was - how often will partner pass a 3@D bid and raise 3@H to game? |pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|athene: if there are lots of hands he can have where that is possible, then maybe 3@H was right|pg||
nt|henryb: get a cat, roger, to control the mouse|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: can you get wireless cats?|pg||

nt|mariner1: E can't be sure he can beat 3@D........|pg||
nt|lestergold: double is clear cut at mps but doubling into a vul game is not best recommended|pg||
nt|lestergold: at imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: soemtime su have to defend and take ur one or even two off|pg||

nt|thegarve:  2S was the clear call even without the honours|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: also, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates, Sharon|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: last but definitely not least, thanks to all our spectators, their tips and comments|pg||

nt|lestergold: west hand is iof course very good|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|thegarve:  some would try 4@C|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|athene: 2@C or 4@C not outrageous|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: north sensibly did not double|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H can be set of course|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|asnuttyas: but getting to 4@S may have been a problem|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|viren169: 2@D - 4@S?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|lestergold: david must have felt that he was too good to bid spades immediately so a doubloe first sadly he caught tom with an auto pass|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: That would have done the trick for sure :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: as i said that would how a weaker hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: To answer a question, Hackett leads by 5 in the other Semi|pg||
nt|viren169: a little bit of a problem with entries here|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: so perhaps on the Goldilocks Principle 3@C has to be the right call :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 4@S could be beat so|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|mariner1: agreed Mike, N better off with no dbl......|pg||
nt|lestergold: but north has not got the info ti know toi swithc to dims|pg||
nt|xenya: with a @D switch|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: hard to judge what they will try in the other room|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mariner1: Bill meaning its all you can "Bear"?    :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The trouble with 4@C is that sometimes you either push them to a making contract they were not going to bid - or they simply take the penalty|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk4: Other semi-final after 8 boards: Hackett 14  Allfrey 9|pg||
nt|viren169: South planning on setting up the clubs the hard way!|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/whave the tempo|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: club switch also good enough|pg||
nt|mariner1: well bidding 2@C might have made it easier to find the killing defense to 4@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: however that is double dummy for sure|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d3|pc|s7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|star6ija: third place Macedonia|pg||
nt|viren169: with plenty of stops in the other suits... and clubs 3-3 all seems ok|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: unlucky contract it looks|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Suppose Robson had played a club instead of  a heart - East ruffs and if South overruffs he loses control and is down in 3@S - at least I thnk he is|pg||
nt|mariner1: did he really play small @H?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s6|pc|c5|pg||
pc|sT|nt|roswolf: indeed declarer may well run out of control|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: strange things happening|pg||

nt|mdgraham: strange days, indeed|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|viren169: unlucky for who?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: for n/s|pg||

nt|athene: i don't see the advantage of ducking the @HK there|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: escapes me too|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: of course he wanted declarer to repeat the finesse - but then what?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: however 170 dif is a 5 imp gain|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: take the @S hook and make minor slam with @H lead|pg||

nt|mariner1: yes looks like 3 now|pg||
nt|roswolf: MIGHT!?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: spade finesse to take care of heart loser or dim finesse|pg||

nt|thegarve:  the england team nil point|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: minorwood then|pg||

nt|viren169: looking for the 4-4 spade fit if it exists...|pg||

nt|chessmaste: Famous last words.....|pg||
nt|roswolf: will west open?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: n/s have 3s better than e/ws 2h|pg||
nt|mariner1: part scores here|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|mariner1: NS even have a play for 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: backwards dim finesse yes unlikley play|pg||
nt|mariner1: repeated @H leads would make game difficult though|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|xenya: almost impossible to bid, too|pg||
nt|lestergold: lucky to even find spade fit now|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a transfer sequence|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: souths hand too weak for another effort|pg||
nt|thegarve:  1!@S denies a 4-card major|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: north fixed|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|lestergold: butt 3h is fine for n/s its one off|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart lead the defence can run the hearts and on the last, south can signal for a diamond|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|lestergold: 2 off if they find club ruff|pg||
nt|xenya: could be 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: my son's requirements for a third in hand non vul effort are 13 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: that leaves declarer with @SAKQ @DA|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|viren169: not an easy ride here for Tom...|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|mariner1: yes no DBL though so maybe EW win an imp|pg||
nt|mariner1: what is EW NT range?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|lestergold: south must be able to show suit pref for dim|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|mariner1:  http://www.fascicod.net/ -  Tournament site|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup -3 is optimum|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|roswolf: 15-17 i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|thegarve:  needed a way to show a balanced invite with @c|pg||
nt|mariner1: then I think the E raise 2N is too aggressive,,,,,,|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree but as i said before east is not a shrinking violet|pg||
nt|athene: north is worried about @DA10 with declarer|pg||
nt|chessmaste: He had a decent five card suit - not far out |pg||
nt|athene: but if the diamonds are frozen, declarer will just have time to get the clubs going|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: wow|pg||
nt|athene: @S2 wasn't small enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: the au pair also played a jack - but hers was a red one|pg||
nt|roswolf: :0|pg||
nt|mariner1: what do I know :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|h7|nt|viren169: not an easy pith on the last heart|pg||
pc|h9|nt|viren169: ...pitch...|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: spade switch beats this out of hand|pg||
nt|viren169: T of @D would have been best from dummy... (thks specs)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: i dont think n/s likely to find their spade fit with west as dealer in any event|pg||
nt|xenya: well defended|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|lestergold: even if he runs the club finds the dim still has to drift one off|pg||

nt|vugraphznu: 4 captains decided this match to be broadcasted, because it's international, and we failed to translate the semifinal... The final is playing with the same cards and we will not ...|pg||

nt|snorris: good slam bid in or|pg||
nt|snorris: if n-s dont bid it its all over I guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|Walddk4: This is the last board of the set. Many thanks to Carol Grunder, our outstanding operator at Wilderness. Well done!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|vugraphzrb: :) :)|pg||
nt|davpro: Even if they bid 7 and make (doubt they will) it will almost be over. Or?|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Our appreciation to the South African Bridge Federation for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. Here we have Carol again; she has been instrumental in setting up a fine show|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|Walddk4: We will all make 7@H, 7@C and 7NT of course. But you won't at the table|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Club finesse with the odds|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|snorris: sure|pg||
nt|snorris: they dont play rkcb here it seems|pg||
nt|davpro: W might lead the suit. It won't be @s or @h (will it)...|pg||
mb|6H|nt|snorris: otherwise 5@s from north|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|snorris: the "natural" lead is @ds from west imo|pg||
