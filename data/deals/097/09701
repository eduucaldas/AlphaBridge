pc|d8|pc|h5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|jlrice: hurd will probably be -1   for another 5 imp pickup for rogoff|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Hurd asking Rogoff some questions|pg||

nt|olson: do both pairs  play a strong club ?|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@S should be off|pg||
nt|star6ija: as far as we failed in translating the semifinals, the captains of four teams decided to broadcast the international match|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|lestergold: looks like another easy 3N|pg||
mb|1H|nt|garnetts: Hard hand for east here--would love to pre-empt--but surely the wrong shape unless it shows hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|jvage: South got a very strong hand (20 hcp), but I strongly prefer 1@c if playing natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mmmakela: welcome all! hope the technical probs have been sorted out|pg||
nt|panja: it seems they do...|pg||
nt|fifee: muideburg style hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT makes for NS|pg||
nt|jvage: 3NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|olson: yes|pg||
nt|fifee: now Karakolev is showing long @Ds|pg||
nt|garnetts: 500 best defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: 6NT for NS|pg||
nt|garnetts: lead singleton|pg||
nt|fifee: 6nt wont make|pg||
nt|garnetts: agreed unless west covers the Q@C |pg||
nt|fifee: unless East does not lead a @H|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: probably make ten tricks for another flattie|pg||
nt|fifee: right David|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: this is not a good bid by west surely|pg||
nt|fifee: Popov frustrated with all his values|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphzkv: yes, they do.|pg||
nt|panja: this will be an interesting 3Nt|pg||
nt|olson: S will be endplayed at trick 1  into giving up a trick  |pg||
nt|panja: South must avoid a Club lead..|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: Andonov is thinking|pg||
nt|garnetts: East must be something like he is with longer diamonds so this makes no sense--if east is forced it will hurt|pg||
nt|star6ija: same boards will be played at the final and of course we will not close the broadcast before to tell you who is the winner|pg||
nt|mcarroll: good pragmatic bid|pg||
nt|jvage: Agree|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@d is possible here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: Bulgarian CS's semi, 2x20 boards|pg||
nt|wwalter: this could be expensive :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: and Clubs of course|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|olson: the best lead  is spade J  but this is impossible  |pg||
nt|jvage: Yes, but impossible (or at least very difficult) to find after 3@s|pg||
pc|c9|nt|fifee: 6@C is on |pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure I would move as South---partner is almost marked with four hearts--otherwise west would have raised over 2@H |pg||
nt|star6ija: well done by Robev|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Friederike from Germany|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello all.|pg||
nt|lestergold: if not bothering with dim finesse make more maybe|pg||
nt|fifee: east did well not to push them to 6|pg||
nt|garnetts: I also agree that 6@C will make --should make even --maybe North should bid it|pg||
nt|kippari: testi|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kippari: TX Roland|pg||
nt|maribelxx: Tervehdys kaikille!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True but almost impossible to get to after W's 3@S bid - maybe if playing Strong Club but not in a natural auction|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|panja: well, @S8 or 6 will work fine|pg||
nt|olson: both D and H leads  pick up those suits|pg||
nt|olson: declarer should duck low spade lead  to the 10|pg||
nt|maribelxx: Lupasin hetken teitä häiritä :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|panja: ideally, the 6/5 rather|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|wwalter: this should be 1 down|pg||

nt|sybarra: hello Markku |pg||

pc|d2|nt|lestergold: if south ducks this which he has decklarer canty now take a dim finesse!|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|olson: declarer  has some work  to do|pg||
nt|panja: North should have ducked @HQ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|olson: D a  play makes  it easy now|pg||
nt|olson: yes|pg||
nt|fifee: with such a square hand, I would not bid 6 with north hand either on this auction|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3N is a practikal shot|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|garnetts: with four aces and the spade finesse marked ?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|mmmakela: now 1st maj finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: will make the rest i think|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|olson: ducking H Q  is best  since  N knows  H  4/2  and  declarer  has the  K|pg||
nt|panja: North seems to be in a hurry, in these situations where tenaces are everywhere, patience pays|pg||

nt|jbgood: what can he do?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: 4@S could be -1 on trump leads so EW are flirting with trouble here|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlrice: he is afraid they are trying to steal from them   but i might be more inclined to pass knowing that opponents are vul vs not|pg||

pc|d3|nt|danilo1: waw ... |pg||
nt|garnetts: This about the Q@S which will not be hard to locate--since North will be marked with the A@D ---and South opened|pg||
nt|fifee: declarer needs to ruff 2@D or find the @SQ|pg||
nt|kaapo: Välitarjouksen ansiosta löytyi hyvä lähtö|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||

pc|d4|nt|sybarra: or a 4 @H cue?|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: I think E should take another call (maybe easy from here) I am just not sure what call it should be|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jvage: yes, but North would not need much extra before 2@d is better, he can then raise a preference and is more seldom passed|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: well north can establish that heart but never cash it|pg||
nt|baldfriede: No entry to the 4th @h.|pg||
nt|wwalter: they will find out the basic sistem :)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Whereas the @H lead is much worse|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|s4|nt|garnetts: The defence should stay with @D but they nearly always switch|pg||
nt|garnetts: I cannot see any point is cashing the A@C |pg||
nt|fifee: dummy reversal the easiest line from here. sluffing the @S9 and ruffing a @S to establish the suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: Must be thinking of that or ruffing two diamonds |pg||

nt|jlrice: yes 3NT is a good spot|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|jbgood: but impossible to reach?|pg||
nt|jlrice: 4@h will go down with spade lead|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess 4@h may fail on the normal spade lead, though|pg||
nt|jlrice: will make on any other lead though|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed it will, but any other lead would be a bit odd after West's opening bid|pg||
nt|jlrice: true|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Welcome to jan Martel who normally operates with me here but not this year|pg||
nt|janm:  Hi all|pg||
nt|jlrice: hi|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|dburn: still, no chance of reaching 3NT now, so North-South have done as well as they could to stop in 3@h|pg||

nt|jlrice: rogoff could try to endplay hurd into giving ruff sluff|pg||

nt|Walddk5: This is a round-robin semi-final among 8 teams. 7 matches of 20 boards over three days|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is a lot of bds|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 9@d makes the day.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: sure :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: a break from the monotony of 3n|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Jon Sveindal from Norway|pg||
nt|panja: well, I should think that without @SA with West......there is simply not 3@S bid|pg||
nt|olson: E needs to count to 4 winners  to  beat the hand  and he knows  they are not getting a club  |pg||
nt|garnetts: looks a bit like 2@S all pass to me|pg||
nt|jvage: The second 20+ hand for south on only 4 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a thin 4s looking like it shouild make if they bid it|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi all|pg||
nt|panja: this is another interesting hand..NS are missing 3 Aces..|pg||
nt|kippari: 3x3NT aloitettu|pg||
nt|kaapo: Tikkimäärä on laskussa|pg||
nt|kippari: tikit vähenee peli peliltä|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|sybarra: E may back in later? or wil S bid 5 @D?|pg||
nt|wwalter: good was not in red :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: Hi, Jon :)|pg||
nt|panja: 26 HCP..they will just about make 3Nt because SQ is in|pg||
nt|kaapo: Tosin nyt taitaa olla paljon tikkej|pg||
nt|jvage: This time a balanced 24|pg||
nt|star6ija: The dealing machine loves him|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kaapo: ä|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The 4-1 split in trump dooms 6@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: eventual overbid by West or East may be dangerous ... slam may be tried by partner than|pg||
mb|2N|nt|santyclz: But if they bid 3nt it's unlikely to be monotonous.|pg||
nt|lestergold: lose 2h and a dim |pg||
nt|lestergold: true!|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: 16 seems ok for a srtong 1 @c?|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the spade fit land dim singleton with east makes this and an unlikely candidate for 3n|pg||
nt|danilo1: as it is happening ... East will probably try slam now|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is the drawback of the multi--North should double now I think--partner is marked with spade length|pg||
nt|garnetts: IF west started with 2@S I doubt North would bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: South must deceide between pass and 4@H|pg||
nt|garnetts: Pass looks a better bet as it is almost certain to go plus|pg||
nt|fifee: or 3NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But they will probably settle for 3NT|pg||
mb|3H|nt|panja: 4 tricks in @H, 3 in some minor, two in @S...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this can be -1   |pg||
nt|panja: of course he could steal one more in other minor..|pg||
nt|fifee: likely to be some ruffing at a suit contract|pg||
nt|kippari: tässä luulisi silti riittävän|pg||
nt|maribelxx: virolaisilla on omansa, siellä merikotka jo pesii http://www.looduskalender.ee/en/node/2909|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: quickly or slowly |pg||
nt|wwalter: thay play prec, so under 15|pg||
nt|jbgood: som spade contract coming up? 4 is good - but the club split and the spade loser makes it very difficult|pg||
nt|garnetts: He will probably place his partner with four hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: well, ad only 1 more Hcp (@CA instead K) and ... lay down (could be even 7)|pg||
nt|jvage: my guess is that they end in 3NT, where the lead will be critical|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: the hand has tlo be managed competently to ensure ten winners|pg||
nt|santyclz: I hate to lead the suit of a splinter, but everything else looks worse here.|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ristit vähän vinossa|pg||
nt|star6ija: it will fail on a @s lead|pg||
nt|jvage: difficult to find, a diamond is natural|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: with ace of dims onside that should not prove to be too much of a problem|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially with the lead!!|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi Silvia:)|pg||
nt|maribelxx: ja vasemmalla on linkki kotkaTV, jonka takaa löytyy videoklippejä (niissä ei pimeys haittaa :) )|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mcarroll: but almost impossible to find a @S lead from W|pg||
nt|star6ija: board 1 in OR is the same as here|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|sybarra: no -2 if the carding is read well |pg||
nt|mmmakela: could've been -2|pg||
nt|garnetts: Interesting choice of lead--it is usually considered best when you have a trump stack to lead a long suit to shorten declarer|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: mind you every lead would help dclarer ex cept for a tump|pg||
nt|danilo1: maybe same lead in 6 :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: even so 12 tricks :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: not pleasant time for South now ... any card may be trick now ... |pg||

pc|s5|nt|jbgood: both Ns passed the double - would you?|pg||
nt|jlrice: i wouldnt|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I ignore one level doubles so would have responded 1@H|pg||
nt|janm:  The Goren team has a chance to get some IMPs on the board here, if Hurd can make 1@h|pg||

mb|d|nt|vugraphzkv: little discust on table :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h makes 5d safe even 6d may make|pg||
nt|danilo1: 6@C for NS ... may be foud since West will probably produce some oppening including @H (weak or two-suiter)|pg||
nt|kippari: kuka voittaa tarjoussarjan tässä|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: W might enter the bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: think I might open that N hand with 1 @H |pg||
nt|tweety1: 4 makable|pg||
nt|lestergold: not that 6d is a good contract!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|danilo1: opps ...srry, @S ruff|pg||
nt|jbgood: this time 3 nt may make if they get there on the scattered values|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S will be a good spot here....|pg||
nt|panja: depends on @C guess|pg||
mb|d|nt|mcarroll: Opening 1NT with a 5 card Major is becoming  more prevalent - and understandarle because of rebid problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: Goddess beware; definitely not a good idea to go for 6@d.|pg||
nt|lestergold: probbaly well settle in 4h|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Or he may try 3nt.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6d we can see veryhazardous even ith favourable lie of red suit honours|pg||
nt|tweety1: 3 @s seems ok|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@D alerted is?|pg||
nt|danilo1: tr. @H, thanks|pg||
nt|wwalter: 4@c-4@d|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Boian Halachev from Bulgaria|pg||
nt|ppilot: hi all|pg||
nt|wwalter: hi Boian|pg||
nt|danilo1: I thk South should produce one more bid - probably 3@H, partner's 3@C was free bid|pg||
nt|ppilot: if peichev bids will drive them to vulnerable game:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: Good morning Boian|pg||
nt|kaapo: Avaus 2@C olisi molemmat ylävärit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: good desision|pg||
nt|wwalter: this is better than 6@c , down :)|pg||
nt|panja: they need to find out @D weakness though, and typically, methods tell you only about Major controls|pg||
nt|garnetts: Normally that would show Dummy's first bid suit--and a decent hand|pg||
nt|jvage: Was that 15-17? As a kib says most would upgrade to 18-19 I think|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Board 2 same contract in Open|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: so that N can describe his hand better|pg||
nt|jbgood: I wonder if 2 NT would be forcing?|pg||
nt|olson: will depend on lead|pg||
nt|panja: not enough HCP for Nt, and @D suit open...still bidding does not seem out of the world...|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: hm is this a serious stop?|pg||
nt|lestergold: a horrible contract|pg||
nt|jbgood: I guess there is only 9 tricks in spades as well|pg||
nt|olson: chance for a pickup  now|pg||
nt|panja: and now...where should @CQ be placed..|pg||
nt|kaapo: Joten Mirme joutuu avaamaan 1@D|pg||
nt|star6ija: in board 5 E discarded @h|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: communications dire apart from the pade weakness|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade weakness|pg||
nt|tweety1: with AJ in @s, S chose to bid 3nt which is not a bad option.|pg||
nt|ppilot: anyway at the other table they might bid 5 he sacriface so win 2 imps:)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: nothing wrong with souths bid- everything wrong with north's accdeptance|pg||
nt|danilo1: Guess they would not try 6@C ... West's bid over Dble is probably @S shorth|pg||
nt|panja: % is for E to have it..|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|olson: declarer should play club K  since  the 4/1 split onside can be picked  up  |pg||
nt|panja: you assume he has 4 @D at most..|pg||
nt|star6ija: on the last @d|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: or then 1 nt?|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: Yes--not the worse slam I have ever seen but the trump break makes things awkward--needs care in game |pg||
nt|fifee: the pre empt makes it hard to find though|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: south has heard the slam try and has 3 bullets!|pg||
nt|tweety1: 4 @d or 4@h ?|pg||
nt|ppilot: hard for popov now:)|pg||
nt|danilo1: guess so, 3@C would be also pass/corr ... thk enough to bid 3@C, after all, it is free bid|pg||
nt|wwalter: in the first 2 rounds they made 49 VP from a posible 50 :)|pg||
nt|jvage: even 6@d is makeable with the clubfinesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: this is also strange|pg||
nt|olson: ew are playing  negative free bids   2h  was not forcing  |pg||
nt|kaapo: 12-16 epätasainen käsi tai 15-17 tasainen|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@D joko 0-7 tai 12+|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: Oops.|pg||
nt|lestergold: er em|pg||
nt|lestergold: perhaps 4d wasnt forcing in south's opinionm maybe just competitive|pg||
nt|lestergold: onviouslhy north must have inbtended it as forcing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: No squeeze available|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: It looks as if N did not communicate his hand correctly.|pg||
nt|tweety1: I didnt like 4 @d either.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 NT = end of discussion|pg||
nt|rhelle: it shouyldn't make, I think|pg||
nt|maribelxx: enpä nyt löytänyt mitään varsinaista systeemilappua Ranna Ruudusta, mutta Arvon moniste vironkieltä harjoitteleville http://www.bridge.ee/MV/Konv/priimagi.pdf|pg||
pc|d9|nt|danilo1: well, much better fit (3-2) than in first board (2-1) :)|pg||
nt|ppilot: seems popov double as weak nt meaning points so that explain all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: a little break after the board|pg||
nt|rhelle: but on this lead it will|pg||
nt|jbgood: absolutely|pg||
nt|rhelle: I guess it needed a @h lead to defeat it - impossible to find|pg||
nt|olson: W would need to double  1s  to set up a forcing sequence|pg||
nt|olson: or cue bid  |pg||
nt|panja: there is a very small window for that negative free bid to work....more useful in Prec..narrow range opening systems..|pg||
nt|jvage: looks like very natural bidding (apart from 3@c, probably 4. suit forcing)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kippari: eiköhän tässä kutonen löydy,taisi joutua väärään käteen|pg||
nt|kaapo: Kohta varmaan nähdään, osaavatko pojat ässäkyselyn|pg||
pc|d5|nt|garnetts: It does--but it would be tough enough anyway|pg||
nt|fifee: for sure|pg||
nt|star6ija: @c are for three tricks and even if they were for 2 only there is another squeeze against E after giving opps 1 @d|pg||
nt|jvage: 4NT quantitative looks like a reasonable alternative to 3NT (if they don't play that as Blackwood)|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: i must admit it does look like a competitive bid for the part score- how is south to know that it is anything other than that?|pg||
nt|jvage: 3NT was a sligth underbid after the strong 2@s (that should show more than a reverse)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ppilot: and his partner playes as agg strong which is 5 min 4 major|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Any slam needs 2 finesses so a 25% shot|pg||
pc|s3|nt|maribelxx: :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kaapo: Sitä ei näämmä tarvittu|pg||

pc|s5|nt|olson: 11 winners  now  after  trumps  split|pg||

nt|jbgood: 3 nt a nice contract - but for the defense having 5 aces|pg||

nt|mmmakela: S didn't open in 3rd so a very  rare pppp|pg||

nt|santyclz: Sounds as if it should be a new "law".  Gold's Law  1?|pg||

nt|santyclz: well playing grand slam's inm part scores is not match winning bridge|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh am i to be immortalised for that gem|pg||
nt|tweety1: i hope they will bid @ds right this time:)|pg||
nt|ppilot: interesting board|pg||
nt|jbgood: nice layout for a nonbiddable 6 @d|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to George Holland and Markku M. Mäkelä|pg||
nt|daman: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi all!|pg||
nt|daman: they started early on us     |pg||
nt|kippari: jaossa 1 Kalma Maastik tarjosivat 6D=9 imppiä|pg||
nt|kaapo: Joten ehkä Kauko tosiaan ei voinut kysyä ässiä|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: rare as nowadays|pg||
nt|santyclz: We might do some editting first.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: appears so|pg||
mb|1C|nt|fifee: 4@H makes |pg||
nt|garnetts: They will probably bid it now|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: @d 2-2, @c finesse right ... no such a great slam :)|pg||
nt|daman: most of the Bulgarians play precision|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sybarra: heading to 3 nt|pg||
nt|tweety1: strong club system is very common in Bulgaria I suppose.|pg||
nt|sybarra: must be a club system with that 1 @D opening |pg||
nt|mmmakela: my estimate is that 4xp with today's aggressive bidding happens maybe 1/200 deals about|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: no slam played by south due to the heart ruff|pg||
nt|ppilot: 5 clubs 4 SPADE|pg||
nt|danilo1: guess 4@S Dbled ... not probable West will get chance to mention @C|pg||
nt|jbgood: may even only be 11 tricks..|pg||
nt|daman: so they open any 11 point hand 1@D|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S might have been a reasonable spot for EW here..but the 51 break will kill it|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jvage: I would have bid my spades as east, but at least he may make the defense more difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: 2 KC out anyway|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, you need to ruff 2@s and 2@c ... and after 2 rounds of trumps you have only 3 trumps left|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@h is an interesting bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: so only 1 loser - but also only 11 winners:)|pg||
nt|olson: not ewnough  points  |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Pragmatic bid but opposite  a 3card @S suit, 6@S is a definite possibility|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|baldfriede: Yes, @h ruff will set it.|pg||
nt|lestergold: a sensible spot|pg||
nt|tweety1: good judge by N this time:)|pg||
nt|kippari: ja ylitikistä 1 lisää jaossa 2|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: 3n was fine too but dont blame north wanting top lay in dims|pg||
nt|daman: forced to rebid his 4 bagger :)|pg||
nt|panja: y..but xxxx @H opposite @HA...and @C body working|pg||
nt|olson: declarer would also need to pick up clubs  for  4 winners  and this is  anti %  |pg||
nt|olson: since the  diamonds  are  2  losers|pg||
nt|kaapo: @C tasan joten tässä ei liene suurta jännitystä|pg||
nt|kippari: väh. 9 tikkiä näkyisi löytyvän tästäkin jaosta|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: just in case there is a hole in one of the black suits|pg||
nt|jbgood: should really be a big takeout 3 @h|pg||
nt|daman: this contract will be tough to make|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5 min won't fair but 3 nt has chance|pg||
nt|panja: y, not enough strength to bid any game..|pg||
nt|panja: @DT from JT9..I guess it promises Jack..|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: needs to duck the 1st @s to make.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: as it can be seen luck is with the brave|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@C by South is much better bid than 3@S ... he is limited in precision, and hand is very good, esp. since 1S should be 5+|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT has 2 chances....slim and none|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ppilot: wonder how much time this will last ? no duplication at all and still many stones to be made|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mmmakela: good lead director bid, needs to duck 1st|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mmmakela: and guess hearts|pg||
nt|tweety1: and also 2-4 leads are common too.|pg||
nt|rhelle: ouch ... why didn't south introduce his @d?|pg||
nt|rhelle: clearly didn't get the meaning of 3@h|pg||
nt|jbgood: strange he didnt want to play the 9 card trump fit..|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not with 3-lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: welll declarer will have a high blood pressure momwent shortly when he leads a dim from dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think e will have at least a mini tank and then run the dim in any case|pg||
nt|jvage: The clubholding (including the 9) also made the NT-bid tempting|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kippari: ruutulähdöllä ne on syytä nopeasti ottaakin|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|lestergold: next time someone will lead their singleton holding Kx dims!!|pg||
nt|rhelle: but if North ducks 1 round of @h, he should get a fair way here|pg||
nt|daman: now return a @H and duck|pg||
nt|daman: then it is 2 down|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|garnetts: Chance of a reverse Grovesnor Coup  here--drop the Q@H under the A@H --the grovesnor coup involves playing the Q from qJx to annoy declarer|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jvage: Should make an easy overtrick even with the hearthonours wrong and the bad split in spades|pg||
nt|jvage: He already got 9 on top|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tweety1: @h ace must be in S to make.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Martin Garvey|pg||
nt|olson: S should  switch  to the  Jack of H   |pg||
pc|hK|nt|jbgood: if N has a 2 suiter - she would have bid the second duit directly - I think - so she must have @d also. Perhaps a redouble of 3 NT would have made it crearer to S|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, I think you're right, Jon|pg||
nt|rhelle: maybe South thought that 3@h just showed a very strong hand, and after 3@c a monster 2-suiter|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@c, sorry|pg||
nt|rhelle: which is not unreasonable|pg||
nt|rhelle: but a XX over 3NT would clear it up|pg||
nt|rhelle: now North has blocked the @d suit|pg||
nt|jbgood: is this really how the @d suit has been played? The 6?|pg||
nt|rhelle: this is not going to go well|pg||
nt|jbgood: depends on what team you are rooting for..|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes ... I am impartial, so I'm just looking from declarer's perspective|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: Danailov is thinking|pg||
nt|rhelle: and I unserstand why. Is he going to try and cut down on @c ruffs by returning a trump, or trying to get declarer trump short?|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps he thinks that N is 6-4 in the blacks (as S may think too)|pg||
nt|thegarve:  afternoon|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|tweety1: blocked|pg||
nt|lestergold: phew|pg||
pc|hT|nt|tweety1: sure|pg||

nt|daman: the Garve   welcome  |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Congrats on the Camrose win. Great stuff!|pg||
nt|daman: Popov has decided to let them make this one|pg||
nt|panja: note that because Declarer will get forced, he will make only 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|olson: called a  surround  play  incase  declarer has  q  or  AQ|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d8|nt|vugraphzpt: This is the second last board of this set|pg||

nt|janm:  Although, he did lead one here :)|pg||

nt|danilo1: probable will make 9|pg||

pc|d8|nt|tweety1: we say 'playing under the table' :)|pg||

nt|panja: difficult to attribute fault to that lead..|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|olson: NS had 4 winners  on a non diamond lead  but the  lead  was somewhat normal  with 2 aces|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mmmakela: yes if 15 upper limit|pg||
pc|s8|nt|tweety1: two Qs damages the beauty of the hand:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think he showed at least 18-19 of his points.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jvage: No lead are very critical, but a spade cetrainly did not put fear into declarer|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/wcarding what would east have played if he had held qH?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mmmakela: but 6-4|pg||
nt|rhelle: and I don't understand the @dK either|pg||
nt|fifee: now down 2|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think the play was poor as South is surely marked with the A@H |pg||
nt|garnetts: matched the bid of 6@H :)  |pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|mmmakela: same card I suppose|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|olson: E was  very happy to know  the  opps  play  Rusinow leads   when the  Q  was led|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|d6|pc|sA|pg||
nt|thegarve:  the scores are at http://www.bridge.bg/en_UK/ranking60.html|pg||

nt|ppilot: seems steliana made 10 tricks at hearts as i thought and ilko lost only 1 imp for biding missunderstanding|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Wrong play in @Cs, plays for S to duck with @CK which makes no sense |pg||
pc|d4|nt|tweety1: what is your suggestion for opening pls Markku?|pg||
nt|jvage: agreed, but no way to go down on the actual layout|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True we are just looking at overtricks|pg||
pc|s5|pc|dT|pc|c4|pg||
nt|olson: maybe  south will duck the dia  lead  towards the  J  to give a guess|pg||
nt|panja: I need to logoff now, thx Jeff, all, bye|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c7|nt|danilo1: finaly @C ... thk lot of times before schould be played|pg||
nt|olson: good play  |pg||
nt|olson: once  S  knows  E  is  1h and 2c   this is safe to duck  |pg||
nt|olson: as  E  is marked  6142  pattern |pg||
nt|olson: to the  10  and the  J  North  shows  out|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jbgood: but of course not bidding on the E hand turned out very good|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|mmmakela: now S "knows" E has dias A|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ppilot: 9 tricks |pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|reisig: This has "push" written all over it|pg||

mb|3N!|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|janm:  Was 2@c artificial or just trying to get information?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Seems NS playing 2/1 so 3@S was STRONG preference|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: probably artificial GF|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpt: Bad spot really as 6NT has chances wven when spades break badly but 6@S hasn't|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Director says 8 minutes before severe penalties kick in|pg||

nt|danilo1: number is right ... the way to them has been little strange|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes ... i'd be tempted to bid 2@s in the pass out|pg||
nt|jbgood: this may be an interesting bidding contest|pg||
nt|rhelle: the NS policy of staying low with near-game values is working for them|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: smoking break|pg||

nt|jbgood: are they smoking cigars?:)|pg||

nt|daman: South is doing his best to mess things up for EW|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: or 3?|pg||

mb|p|nt|tweety1: wow|pg||
