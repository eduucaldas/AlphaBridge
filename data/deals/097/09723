nt|lc: I suspect David (vugraphhzpt) is missing the first deal -- maybe has to catch up now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: NO 16 is the first deal|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|lc: Reminder -- pairs set E-W and N-S -- not a normal :mitchell movement.|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|lc: More like a big Howell movement.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: For late arrivals, this event is a 48 pair round robin (i.e. 47 rounds) with the scores cross-imped against each of the other 23 tables|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: A 48 pair howell to be exact|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|bjacobs: Apparently, there is some money involved as well|pg||
nt|lc: A normal 4@S here.|pg||
nt|ritong: only a rumour|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: $US958,500 plus players pool|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|lc: Maybe 6@S makes on the very lucky layout, but "nobody" will bid it.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|lc: I expect a big string of 480's/|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Lots of writing of explanations going on|pg||
nt|lc: Opp a weak notrump, it is quite pushy to try for slam with South's hand.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpt: could get there now singleton opp Ace|pg||
nt|lc: Surely, Moss can't be worth any more, can he?|pg||
nt|lc: Even if he does use RKC, he will be off a KEYCARD and @SQ, so can't get past 5@S.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Inknow I can I think I can said the engine as it tried to push to slam|pg||
nt|lc: It is hard for me to picture a good slam opposite a flat 12-14 (especially since these boys open 1NT on so many decent 14's).|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Make that @HQ the @SQ?|pg||
nt|lc: Still lots of handling.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|vugraphzpt: You lose|pg||
nt|lc: And, I never like to play for "magic" -- my partners never have it.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: True ... anyway, they will stop in 5@S I reckon - the worst of all worlds|pg||
nt|lc: Well, I still have them stopping in 5. ... :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: It is the opps that have majic on this one|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|lc: Just looking at N-S, surely, slam is well under 50%.|pg||
mb|d|nt|lc: So, 1KC, now a Queen ask -- but why should I be right now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: You can write this double up iin one of your books LC - that will propel them to slam for sure|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What the hell is that double?|pg||
nt|lc: Well, East expects partner to lead a @H or @C, and I suppose he prefers a @C since if partner is to lead from a king...|pg||
nt|ritong: a support double?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: or sport double|pg||
nt|lc: I honestly understand the X.  That's how bad our opening leads are :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Makes about as much sense as anythinig else Henri|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ritong: meaning " i can help if you lead a @c pard"|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|lc: Yes.  Who wants a @H lead?  (Although, he didn't X 4@H for the lead).|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Anyway, there is the queen ask and denial.  They are slightly comfortable on the 5-level but will survive.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: There isnt much about this auction that I would like somebody young and innocent and with a heart condition to study too hard|pg||
nt|lc: As Moss writes in +480, he cans at least say that he tried for slam.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bjacobs: Oh, I think that's harsh|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Moss shaking his head - at the club double perhaps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What I see is a very nice hand opposite an opening bid ...|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|lc: What I see is 15 opposite a flat 12-13.  I teach that you need more for small slams.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I am told effectively same auction in other VG room|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe they pay a bonus for reaching 5-of-a-major in this event.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: There's no doubt Larry is right.  But the hand IS tempting, you cannot deny it, and they had good tools to establish @HA, and also the trump position|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Hey hang on who told me that - there wasnt a double of 5@C|pg||
nt|ritong: @h ace was bad new|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Better than the king ...|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ritong: brad certainly would have preferred to hear 4@s|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h7|pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ritong: then his chances to hit a perfecto would have been much better|pg||
mc|12|nt|lc: You are implying he would have gone on over a 4@S sign-off?|pg||
nt|ritong: with no wasted values facing his singleton|pg||
nt|ritong: "sign off"?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Spec asked me where this event is being played.  I said America, but he's not satisfied|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Anybody wanna play 5@C XX|pg||
nt|ritong: just denying red controls i d say|pg||
nt|lc: 4@S over 4@C sounds like the weakest to me. No?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Las Vegas, thanks|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|lc: 6@D by East a nice contract.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: If west 3@D now.............................|pg||
nt|lc: You can play a @H first, then if needed, try @S.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lc: That 3@D bid will hit the jackpot!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: A real Vegas jackpot|pg||
nt|lc: East might just bid 6 -- and they will make it.|pg||
nt|lc: Opposite as little as @DKQxxxx and out, East knows that slam has play.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: 5@C Exclusion Blackwood|pg||
nt|lc: And partner could have a little something on the side.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Partner really has the worst hand with a club honour|pg||
nt|lc: I see no need to try for 7 -- partner would need @DKQ, @HA -- and something else--too much to hope for, I think.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sure, he's wondering whether SIX is there|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|d|nt|lc: Low road.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Bit wet 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Moss asking about bidding - maybe thinking of the red card and yes ther it is |pg||
nt|bjacobs: The major suits are so full of holes ...|pg||
nt|lc: Wow -- any blue cards for East?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I would send this back sitting East|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: No but there is for west|pg||
mb|r|nt|lc: Wouldn't this double suggest a @S lead?|pg||
nt|lc: Dummy's suit?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpt: Who thought this would be such a great round|pg||
nt|lc: So, what is more?  920 or 5xx making 6?  Let's see...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Better here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A nice round number coming up|pg||
nt|lc: One way is to look at the back of the bidding box card -- it gives all the scores.|pg||
nt|ritong: for once, i will express my disagreement with one of brad s initiatives|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 1000 no?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Nice bid by west - knows partner is club void and has good diamonds and is short in partner's second suit one down max so getting over pot odds as they say here in Vegas|pg||
nt|ritong: the @c ace is not supposed to be a trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: 1100|pg||
nt|lc: Another is :  400  (100x4)  + 300 (game)  + 200 (the overtrick) + 100 (the insult).|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: including one overtrick|pg||
nt|lc: I get 1000 -- no?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Ah 1000|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: and a bunch of imps|pg||
nt|lc: I am not a big doubler (nor redoubler), so I don't know these off the top of my head. :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: about 1000 imps as well (cross imping)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: around the 276 we were talking abou earlier 12 x 23|pg||
nt|lc: Since there will be many 920's this will cost only 2 a pop against the 920's.|pg||
nt|lc: I'd guess half the field is 920 -- so not a complete disaster.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I am not so sure there will be that many 920's|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Hey isn't 7 possible|pg||
nt|lc: It is nice to have your disasters when WHITE.  But not too many :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Spade lead ruff the spades good and hey presto|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You'd have to be prepared to play @SQ at trick 1 ...|pg||
nt|lc: I think on @S lead he might go up @SA and make only 5.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A spade lead will look like a singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: What's the risk it has taken Fred far too long to lead for him to have a singleton|pg||
nt|lc: Then, only 800.|pg||
nt|lc: Gitelman must think the X is for @S lead, but hard to imagine with his actual @S holding.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: at least 2 minutes - singleton out of the question in my mind and if finesse is working will need the trick|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bjacobs: now we will see ...|pg||
nt|lc: Will he really risk a XX contract for an overtrick?|pg||
nt|lc: if he thinks this is a singleton, he hasn't even made 11 tricks yet!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: If tthe spade is singleton six is failing so all that comes into account|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Only 6 is possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Hussein asking about leads|pg||
nt|bjacobs: i.e. "which card do you lead from a singleton?"|pg||
nt|lc: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I am sure he dooesnt think for a second it is a singleton|pg||
nt|lc: What if it is from Jxxxx?|pg||
nt|lc: Then, finesse to @SK singleton and cross for ruff (would be some double, though!).|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|s5|nt|lc: Everyone is complaining about the silly-looking X -- but they rarely XX -- and sometimes the X can throw them off in the play (as here).|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzpt: Which x is that|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ritong: what is supposed to go wrong for them with brad s hand, frankly?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Its crying time again believe me -800|pg||
nt|lc: So, the lack of overtrick will significantly reduce the swing.  800 will actually win some IMPs against the 920's.  (Although, -400 would have won more) :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzpt: Easy @CK here|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose the fact that the X and XX prevented an overtrick isn't exactly a triumph.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|vugraphzpt: Its claiming time again believe me|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||

qx|o18|st||md|4SAHAKT7DQCKQJT875,SK842HQ862DAK52C6,ST963HJDJ9763C432,SQJ75H9543DT84CA9|sv|n|nt|lc: Usually, when I go for 800, I've at least played the hand.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: :)|pg||
nt|lc: 2@C -- for me anyway.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Time has expired|pg||
nt|ritong: the @c shift should be findable against 5@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Sounds like a speaker in parliament (or in Congress?) ... "the member's time has expired"|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: G-d bless caddies - one just brought me a coffee|pg||
nt|lc: Redoubled contracts will do that to the time.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|bjacobs: But the table is running a filibuster|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe the X will keep South from bidding 5@C so quickly.|pg||
nt|lc: He needs a place for his @H losers in 5@C.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpt: Yes folks this is the auction|pg||
nt|lc: Modern bridge.  Everyone is bidding the other's suit.|pg||
nt|ritong: no problem with that|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|ritong: correct|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: X and XX maybe|pg||
nt|lc: That's trusting your partner!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Note the good 1@S bid (not 1@H) - preparing for the later heart bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Gitelman thinks his singleton @H and 3 trumps are enough.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Twoo rounds of clubs now and ?????|pg||
nt|ritong: so let s see if the @c shift is findable as predicted|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And he's vulnerable - such a huge bonus, particularly with this scoring system|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lc: As Henri said 15 lines ago, West should find @C switch after the @DA lead.|pg||
nt|po-s: they would be if West had a stiff club ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: after @DA of course|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lc: You'd think this an easy shift -- but under time pressure and VuGraph pressure, who can be sure.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Not that easy to find a trump as singleton can be skewering partner's holding|pg||
nt|po-s: here -unlike the other table - it isn´t quite as obvious|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|lc: Yes, but you know declarer is ruffing @H in dummy.  Still, it could be wrong.|pg||
nt|ritong: outch|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|lc: Oops.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: and there you go|pg||
nt|lc: Huge swing for N-S.  Much more than they lost on last one.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: But maybe brad to the rescue he is caressing the @CK|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|lc: huh?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That seems ... interesting|pg||
nt|lc: Will Sadek now be Grosevnored into not playing a @C himself?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Yes folks live to you from Las Vegas - but sadek has to get into the game and play a trump now - is that so easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Two men play same suit one man usually wrong|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c5|nt|lc: Confucious says...|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|po-s: fascinating|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|lc: This is painful to watch.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|c3|nt|po-s: astiff club ace after all|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ritong: when two players play trump, at least one is wrong|pg||
mc|11|nt|bjacobs: I think that was Buddha|pg||
nt|lc: A Grovesnor Gambit.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Close and reopen|pg||
