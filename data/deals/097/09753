nt|petergill: Levin and Weinstein have a massive lead on the field, about the equivalent of 70 real IMPs |pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: for scores|pg||
nt|petergill: @H7 lead = top of nothing, since his Drury 2@D bid showed his length in hearts as exactly four cards|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|petergill: Getting this down one looks easy, but getting it down two might be hard|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bjacobs: The club suit is delicate|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If E/W don't touch it, perhaps there are two losers there|pg||
nt|petergill: yes, being a doubled partscore, this hand will probably take so long to play that there might be limited time for the last 2 hands in this round|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Ugly when the defence draws trumps on you|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|petergill: Diamond ruffed, trumps drawn, then hearts to endplay dummy looks like OK defence to me|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|petergill: Chris Compton should know the entire layout now - the Drury 2@D promised about 10 HCP, thus @CK |pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: q is an excellent play here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: forced an antry|pg||
nt|petergill: Very neat - this works too - if declarer ducks, you play hearts|pg||

nt|bjacobs: That will eat into their 70 imp lead|pg||

pc|c6|nt|petergill: IMPS scoring, so 3NT will make at most, or almost all, tables, with overtricks relatively unimportant. |pg||

mb|2N!|an|asking|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sT|nt|petergill: NS's lead of 1800 imps has to be divided by the number of tables less one - 1800 over 24 is about 73 I think.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Declarer doesn't warm to this lead|pg||
nt|petergill: Fred Gitelman and Brad Moss are 2nd|pg||
