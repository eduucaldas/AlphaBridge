mb|1D!|mb|d|mb|r|an|Shows hearts|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|vugraphzpt: What about passing 1@DXX|pg||
nt|lc: X-fers on this auction very popular today.  XX=@H,  1@H=@S, etc.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|bobh1: don't like passing--with this kind of distro would rather describe my hand than procrastinate|pg||
nt|lc: I prefer to describe my hand while I can.  But at these colors, tempting to play for penalty -- yes, SOuth could have passed.|pg||
nt|bobh1: they're not going to let me play 1@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: South unlimited tro some extent and North has fine hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Results arenot known till after the session|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpt: Last two pairs against P&L will be Deutsch Kranyak and Zagoran Feldman|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzpt: Will make 3 or 4 here|pg||
nt|bobh1: lack of enterprise here|pg||
nt|lc: Surely, pairs will be in 3NT --|pg||
nt|lc: How will that do?|pg||
nt|bobh1: white games get bonuses also|pg||
nt|lc: Down, it seems -|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: 3NT will make with diamond pick thats for sure|pg||
nt|lc: Are you so sure?|pg||
nt|lc: @C lead takes out entry.|pg||
nt|lc: Then def holds up in @D one round.|pg||
nt|lc: Then Down,  No?|pg||

pc|dQ|mc|10|nt|lc: Anyway, who can possibly enter VuGraph and analyze at the same time?  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Thats the best exchange rate for a while|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: And yes you are of course correct|pg||
nt|lc: Hey, times are tough.|pg||
nt|lc: That's why I get the big bucks.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Last year it was $US0.95 to the $A this year $Us0.70|pg||
nt|lc: They pay me $0.00 per session.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|lc: N-S were almost in the money enterring this session. So a good final 27 boards will give them a nice pay day.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|poohbear: they sold for 13000. 500 above the minimum and were 12th going into the session|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzpt: I like Bathurst's 3@S not telling them about the heart suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|lc: Sure, no reason to mention the @H.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|lc: 3@H would be a game try.  Not worth it.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|lc: Trump switch looks right -- but the @H sit so well, that declarer can survive.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|pc|c6|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|lc: Pepsi will play low smoothly on next @H off dummy, but declarer should guess.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|bobh1: is it a guess?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Hard to play queen here|pg||
nt|lc: Not really -- but he is thinking.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Rising will lose badly to Ax on his left|pg||
nt|lc: East marked with the @HA it would seem.|pg||
nt|lc: East opened and WEst has the top @C.|pg||
nt|lc: Possible, though for West to have @HAx.|pg||
nt|poohbear: thinking if stiff honor on the left then @h @d Squeeze will work|pg||
nt|lc: @CA lead could be from, say AQxxx.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Partner supported clubs so west could have AJxxx clubs and ax hearts but odds favour rising|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Only play to make|pg||
nt|bobh1: maybe he'll figure pepsi would have won the ace with this holding|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: He is stroking the @HQ|pg||
nt|lc: East can't have 4@H, though.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|bobh1: lol|pg||
nt|poohbear: true|pg||
nt|lc: Stroking?  What happend to the caressing and massaging?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Each has their own style|pg||
mc|9|nt|bobh1: we're getting marginally more graphic by the minute|pg||
nt|lc: East has 4@D (1@D opening) and 3@C and 3@S (from auction and early play) -- so can't have 4@H|pg||
nt|poohbear: everyone has their own technique Larry. David just reporting how he sees it:)|pg||

nt|bobh1: pretty soon will be x-rated|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I  have been blamed for the bad run by P&L since I commennted on the noice session they have  been amassing|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: That is a youthful opening bid.|pg||
mb|d|nt|lc: The younger you are, the fewer HCP you need.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|bobh1: i can see the appeal of the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: There are sopme other words been thrown at me thhat I will avoid|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|lc: So can I, but partner is likely to drag you into no-play games.|pg||
nt|bobh1: as he is now doing  . . .|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: OK HERE'S THE DEAL AFTER THE FINAL ROUND I WILL LEAVE TTHE TABLE OPEN TILL I GET SOME RESULTS. WHEN I START TO TYPE THEM IN NO INTERRUPTIONS PLEASE|pg||
nt|poohbear: yes dear|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Great you know your role Barry|pg||
nt|bobh1: lall wondering how to get off this train|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|bobh1: slow 3@d does the trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Lev loves plaiung non committal cards|pg||
nt|bobh1: just kidding|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|d6|pc|c6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lc: So, Bathurst knows his partner's propensity to open light and lets him off the hook.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h2|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lc: He knows of the misfit (partner rates to have @S length when opps don't do more than 1@S).|pg||
nt|poohbear: was about to comment on the @h play:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: What does the @S4 on the first trick tell patrtner|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzpt: You pass Barry just seeing if you were awake|pg||
nt|lc: S.P at T1 in this situation.|pg||
nt|lc: When dummy has void or Sing, the signal s/b Suit Pred.|pg||
nt|bobh1: lev figures why tell the opponents anything and he expects his partner to already know everythin|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: have had to take down the webcams as I wont have time to pack up and get results for you later so apologies no more picture uddates there|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|poohbear: Lall could go down now if he misguesses @ds|pg||
pc|c3|pc|hJ|pc|d7|pc|c8|pg||
nt|poohbear: sorry he will just play the last spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Yep I think that's his plan|pg||
nt|lc: Sure, that is 100% to get him 3 more tricks.|pg||
nt|poohbear: lose 2@d and 2@h|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzpt: Bare @HA probably wont help him|pg||
nt|lc: In this form of scoring, once you see your contract, you don't risk it for overtricks.  This @SQ play guarantees 110 or more.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h4|pc|s8|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|s9|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
pc|sT|pc|dT|pc|h8|mc|9|nt|lc: So, a decent result for N-S -- since games will likely fail.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Closing and reopening|pg||
nt|lc: I have to leave now.  Enjoy the last 6 deals.|pg||
