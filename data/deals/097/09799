nt|ady: Jagger in   with system bid for majors     - can make 2@H if they stop there|pg||
nt|thegarve:  West will bid up to at least 3@h|pg||
nt|athene: hi good morning everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome to Wroclaw for the Polish Premier League 2009. Semi-finals, six segments of 12 boards. This is the first|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: running a bit behind schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H or 3N here|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: hello all|pg||
nt|athene: hi again everyone|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: with good card reading, West can make 3@H|pg||

nt|chthonic: Hello all.  Craig Hemphill here|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: hello |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Mateusz|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Jon|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|xenya: doesn't a @D lead beat 3@H?|pg||
nt|ady: anything above 2 level difficult for n/s|pg||
nt|finch: yes|pg||
nt|athene: north could have considered 2@C over 1@H there, perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: non-vul and a pretty fair suit|pg||
nt|jbgood: sry - think i went to the wrong room:(|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|mariner1: careful makes the 3N on any lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|thegarve:  IN the orther room - NOrth somehow stole 1NT+1|pg||
nt|finch: 3@C was forcing, I imagine, otherwise 3NT was a tad optimistic|pg||
nt|frankaus: MM's are a sweet here bit like smartees|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@C Polish  12-14 balanced, or 15+ with clubs or any 18+ (here)|pg||
nt|chthonic: a game hand in spades, no doubt.  Hearts works, too|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: 1nt as a passed hand would be minors, but that doesn't look sensible with such suit disparity|pg||
mb|3H|nt|frankaus: interesting spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: goodcase for passing, holding the @HQ, but I think West will bid 4@H |pg||
nt|sybarra: good stop,  I can not see 9 tricks unless some help |pg||
nt|frankaus: no one plays 2NT to play here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: yes, he has :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorting @D out early would help |pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: around the limit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a bit of pressure on declarer, as he will have a god idea the @SK is wrong - so he won't want to lose two trump tricks |pg||
nt|chthonic: Well, So does this.  Three clubs and the spade ace|pg||

nt|granguru: good stop|pg||
nt|mariner1: W probably makes a good decision not to compete further|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  Reasonable 6@c?|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  Two @d ruffs|pg||
pc|d3|nt|granguru: Hi Rob|pg||
nt|athene: i assume E-W play some variation of Polish Club, so West can't have a 'normal' 2NT rebid (18-19 balanced)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: @DA and another will work well |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi John|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is off if they find the @S ruff|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chthonic: but this looks riskier and depends on the clubs splitting or favorable entries|pg||
pc|s8|nt|frankaus: many will bid & make 3NT i expect|pg||
nt|sybarra: guess we are not going to use @D |pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|athene: but i must say, it looks possible that East was treating 2NT as natural|pg||
nt|athene: (3@C just checking back for 3-card spade fit; 3NT to play)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chthonic: Declarer may agonize, but is protected against disaster.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|granguru: better @CQ and @D...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphp2: running scores: http://tinyurl.com/oh5tmv|pg||
pc|s5|nt|finch: I'm not sure I'd have the bottle to keep ducking clubs here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that was a bit dangerous, ducking - if spades had been 6-1....|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @SK, spade ruff, @DA - one off - but East is ok now  |pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|granguru: but got good result|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Sunil Varghese|pg||
nt|athene: small heart towards the @HJ is the safe play, guarding against @HQ10xx with north|pg||
nt|frankaus: @S now will hold it to 8|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|sK|nt|ady: should be 6 for england|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|Gerben42: please welcome Michael Grom√∂ller|pg||
nt|mariner1: well not the optimum defense|pg||
mc|10|nt|athene: cashing a top heart would be ok if south had a big singleton, but he is more likely to have a small one, if hearts really are 4-1|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Michael|pg||

nt|hedyg: hello :)|pg||
nt|ady: hi Hedy|pg||
nt|ady: only 2nd hand    first was a throw in|pg||
nt|hedyg: after 4 matches: AIDA 64, Kannavos 59, ONYX (Romania) 58, POLINA 58, Papakyriakopoulos 57, Zipovski 54 |pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: missed the announcement . sry|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    n/s with their combined 17 pts  can make  4@C   but will they find the club contract after a no-trump opening from west|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@h limit in EW, 4@c NS|pg||
nt|athene: presumably the 7 imps is some sort of carry-over|pg||
nt|Gerben42: and hi Rob :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Gerben|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mariner1: not sure I believe Open made 6 there :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: someone could get shoved too high here|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: hello|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: could have been held to 8 at various times|pg||
nt|mariner1: easy @H game for EW|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|thegarve:  danger of going overboard in @d|pg||
nt|mariner1: only part scores it seems here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, 7.2 actually|pg||
nt|athene: now north wants to show a good 3-card raise|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But our software does not do fractions|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C would be the normal way if you treat 1@C as natural|pg||
nt|athene: a very weak NT!|pg||
nt|sybarra: but old adage:  where there is 8.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: EW can make 3NT on this layout, but they are unlikely to get there|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   very duplicated   can only make 2@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs a tool to show a 3 suiter|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: E-W have 6@C but pretty much impossible to find at the best of times|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: can double 2@H for t/o now|pg||
nt|ady: north may well re-open with double|pg||
nt|hedyg: even 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: may have to re-open at 3 level|pg||
nt|hedyg: W should pass with QJx in @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: on the other hand the long @hs..|pg||
nt|ady: but nothin much lost if letting e/w play 3@H  should be down 1|pg||
nt|chthonic: Perfect fit, spade finesse onside...|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|finch: hard to stay out of game here, although 3NT looks for most natural final contract|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   not a bad spot for e/w    -  but the diamond unkind   and a likely spade lead will beat it|pg||
nt|thegarve:  I expect 2@d was an Artificial GF|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N very aggressive call from E with his 11|pg||
nt|mariner1: seems he is looking for the 8th and 9th trick|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt makes for N-S - if they see through the backs of the cards|pg||
nt|frankaus: this looks only 9 in @H |pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|an|6!H with shortage|nt|finch: Unusually for a ladies' pair, EW play 5card majors, strong NT|pg||
nt|thegarve:  now with doubt about @h stops - I expect to see 5@d|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And it's very unlucky anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You need @S6 as an entry to take the club finesse|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H is down on the spade ruff|pg||
nt|athene: sorry NS have 6@C :)|pg||
nt|athene: now south will just bid 4@S i imagine|pg||
nt|athene: when you have 5-3 fits in both black suits, clubs rarely get a look-in :)|pg||
nt|athene: south has a good hand facing short diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: all his hcp are working|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Panja|pg||
nt|panja: hi Roland, all|pg||
nt|athene: a spectator just points out that 6@C goes down on diamond lead|pg||
nt|athene: because of course you get forced|pg||
nt|athene: so the 4-1 club break dooms both black slams, for different reasons :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: would you come with @H over 2 @D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: may not get a spade lead on this bidding, mind|pg||
nt|mariner1: I see 8th, 9th will be harder|pg||
nt|Walddk4: *lucky I meant to say|pg||
nt|hedyg: hello again!|pg||
nt|frankaus: will they even mention the suit?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: N might have doubled 2@C for T/O|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but vuln. is not good for a save|pg||
nt|Gerben42: would be -500|pg||
mb|4H|nt|finch: personally sitting West I'd have more doubts about club stops|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D interesting...i wonder if he is trying to keep 3nt in the picture?|pg||
nt|panja: North would have passed the 2@D double..with a BAL|pg||
nt|athene: i can't believe he is considering staying out of game?|pg||
nt|panja: what does the first dbl show? the second?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: pls disregard the score, it has NOTHING to do with this match|pg||
nt|chthonic: No club ruff.  Potential slam swing if anyone is aggressive enough to seek it|pg||
nt|chthonic: but hardly likely with sich weak looking cards east|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but South will probably not have much choice - hearts are going to be the unbid suit, but the singleton @hQ isn't really a candidate|pg||
nt|finch: 3NT is certainly a better spot that 5@D|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE  LIMERICK ****  N-IRELAND 92, SCOTLAND 91, ENGLAND 79,  CBAI 71, IRELAND 68,  WALES 45  ****|pg||
nt|dburn: though I guess clubs might not be a "bid suit" in this auction - not sure how many of them East has promised|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, everyone!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: tought to do so now, over..... |pg||
nt|frankaus: not me|pg||
nt|sybarra: was going to say 3 @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: me either,  since a "live" auction |pg||
nt|frankaus: too round and the traffic lights are red|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dburn: well, West has started bidding them|pg||
nt|finch: East has promised 3@C, although having denied diamond support probably should have 4 now|pg||
nt|finch: looks as if 4@C is a self-cue for diamonds.  Either that, or Gerber.|pg||
nt|dburn: exclusion keycard Gerber for diamonds, one assumes|pg||
nt|thegarve:  3NT off in the other room , I doubt if 5@d will be doubled|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: N/S respect the LAW and do not compete to 3 @H|pg||
nt|athene: if north had shown a good raise, i think south might have gone 3@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: both opps unlimited,  maybe go for 1100 at the 2 level |pg||
pc|d9|nt|chthonic: and making six is too routine to bother discussing.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: since 2@H showed a minimum, don't know what exactly W wanted|pg||
nt|Gerben42: maybe 3NT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dburn: five aces|pg||
nt|finch: 3NT went off after a spade lead, spade return, diamond to the jack ducked|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and a void|pg||
nt|athene: first double is good hand, second is penalties i am assuming|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|mariner1: sure seems E owes W a @S raise here.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West might have tried one more spade there |pg||
nt|athene: 3@H would be very interesting on spade lead, @SAK, ruff, club back to the @CA, fourth spade|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: south did not cover the @D since he wants @C play from p|pg||
nt|frankaus: too much defence  - |pg||
nt|mariner1: can make 5 now|pg||
mc|11|nt|dburn: exclusing @cA, of course|pg||
nt|finch: EW are probably fortunate that everything else is going off |pg||
nt|mariner1: I think over 2@H was needed as well|pg||
nt|athene: if the defence don't do that, the trump position will be revealed and declarer can pick up the @HQ10|pg||
nt|athene: same contract, same lead in other room|pg||
nt|athene: west put the @C10 in|pg||
nt|panja: with such an UNBAL hand, the dbl by N seems a bit odd|pg||
nt|athene: well he is a bit stuck - has to double to show a good hand|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S risks missing game |pg||
pg||

nt|finch: or it could be invitational with the minors (that's how I play it)|pg||
nt|athene: north can't really have @DAK as well as everything else|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: he counted north's points and knew he cud not have the 2nd @D honour|pg||
nt|panja: the dbl carries the risk that South might pass with a BAL hand..and some up to 8 HCP..|pg||
nt|athene: it was easier to read the lead as a singleton perhaps in this room|pg||
nt|panja: 1Nt might be cold..and so might some black suit partial for NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: well done here |pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Craig!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: yes agression is paying off for NS mainly because EW are not that aggressive|pg||
nt|sybarra: dealer having "fun" today |pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S EW here|pg||
nt|mariner1: lose 3 and out|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ady: looks like 4@H  for n/s|pg||
nt|thegarve:  penalty shootout in the FA Cup semi final Man U v Everton, no goals at extra time|pg||
nt|finch: that's what I would call an 'aggressive' 2@D overcall at red|pg||
nt|mariner1: so did not find the 8th then|pg||
nt|mariner1: aggression|pg||
nt|athene: east will probably double 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: NS have 6@H if they can find it|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice 3N here|pg||
nt|mariner1: not the easiest bidding|pg||
nt|hedyg: just stay out of grand..|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@C polish|pg||
mb|1N|nt|finch: EW obviously on the same wavelength, as surely East is close to raising a sound overcall|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops I missed a car, they have 5@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS playing inverted majors to 1@D? |pg||
nt|mariner1: can EW even find it now|pg||
nt|athene: ok - or not :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: not much makes here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: card|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S good spot here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@S - 4@S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dburn: not completely clear that North-South will get these to game|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c hook off stops 6|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe 1@S shows a 1N call|pg||
nt|athene: east will surely double this?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 1@S shows hearts in their methods|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that is, 1@D-1@h=spades and 1@d-1@S=hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: some use 1N as 4+ @S and 1@S and a 1N call to put the 1N in opener|pg||
nt|mariner1: no alert so its hard to tell which it is Mike :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: so Roland knows it seems|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what's the advantage of that, Roland?|pg||
nt|mariner1: E may be pickled here|pg||
nt|hedyg: but N has no reason to go for the grand anyhow|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S should be found routinely. |pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: good prediction|pg||
nt|dburn: since South doesn't have to have a sixt heart for 2@h in this auction|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW did not need much for slam......|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d splinter|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  could bid to 7@H      but  4-1 break  bad     6@H may get swing|pg||
nt|athene: E-W won't do too badly in 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: ah - north isn't going to pass 1nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D |pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: doesn't North have an invite, if they play sound opening bids?|pg||
nt|ady: stopped short      surely worth 3@H|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Kevin Cautious looking at Axxx @d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he has to bid 2@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: again aggression goes to the front for NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: then what |pg||
pc|d6|nt|mariner1: well NS can beat 4@S however it is not their top spot|pg||
nt|mariner1: a defense slip can allow 4@S also|pg||
nt|granguru: very unprobable|pg||
nt|hedyg: S has a QUICK 4@h bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: aha |pg||
nt|frankaus: this will make|pg||
nt|chthonic: A bit light opener, but understandable in a forcing club context.  Still a tad light.  too strong outside, however for 2S|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: running scores: http://tinyurl.com/oh5tmv|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 3N should make too, N has no quick entry|pg||
nt|mariner1: K@D is the play here,,,,,, does no good to duck|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: still N has a good hand -- the pass is questionable i think|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C puppet to 2@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: so will play 2@D  successfully |pg||
nt|frankaus: i like the trump lead in this auction|pg||
pc|dT|nt|dburn: well, they may or may not play sound opening bids, and North might have risked a move anyway, but as I say, it wasn't obvious|pg||
nt|finch: Carol Cautious, surely?|pg||
nt|athene: the defence will only come to @HAK, 3 spades and maybe @DK|pg||
nt|athene: with a balanced hand and just 4 diamonds, south wld open 1@C, usually|pg||
nt|athene: so he has presumably promised 5 here|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: i would double 2@D with east's hand, i have to say|pg||
nt|athene: 5/4 in the unbid suits and some hcp|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|ady: North worried about wastage in diamonds opposite shortage    but north obviously bidding on|pg||
pc|h2|nt|finch: If clubs were 5-1 we'd be saying 'well stopped'|pg||
nt|thegarve:  doubt it|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  SCOTLAND 92, N-IRELAND 90, ENGLAND 79, CBAI 70, IRELAND 70, WALES 45 ****|pg||
nt|mdgraham: some English pairs use this major suit inversion over 1@D, but I can't see any major theoretical merit (or else I'm too stupid)|pg||
nt|athene: sorry @DA|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now enter in @C and @D fin|pg||
nt|athene: no, sorry - they have time to get the @DQ as well|pg||
nt|panja: isn't @D an automatice lead here?|pg||
nt|athene: diamond certainly looks reasonable lead|pg||
nt|chthonic: Afraid I am guessing about the system here.  Relays and asking bids apparently set trumps, asked for shortness with 2NT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 9 tricks since @C comes too late|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: Buras still thinking|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Buras sees @CA in dummy and @DQ in hand, not very promising prospect|pg||
nt|mariner1: S still thinking?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe that 2@d overcall was a good idea after all, although I confess it doesn't look like one|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe 4@s is kickback and 6@c shows 3 keycards..|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Jan Hamburg|pg||

nt|vugraphp2: hello Jan|pg||
nt|othered1: @C lead against 3N will require some good guessing|pg||
pc|h6|nt|othered1: If EW play J denies higher honor, north will likely go right.|pg||
nt|chthonic: And now the rather infamous weakness of "jack denies" may help declarer.  If it does not deny -- standard -- then declarer has a guess.  If it denies, there is a roadmap in the ...|pg||
nt|chthonic: club suit.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: ducking the first heart did give declarer a chance to make by switching to clubs|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg: because normal action for N to ask keycards after 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: but he would have had to guess those right, which is unlikely|pg||
nt|athene: the play gets quite intricate now|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Oliver Clarke|pg||
nt|oliverc: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|panja: 5 IMPs given away on a speculative lead|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|athene: now it's cold again|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: the defence needed to use west's spade as an entry to his @DQ|pg||
nt|athene: this quite often happens in defence to 1nt|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: have stopped in 6   North perhaps being cautious after the sing off after the splinter|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: if you have a 4-4 fit that you have set up|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: you need to not cash it|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||

pc|sK|nt|hedyg: needs help in @C and asked for it with 6@c i guess|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|nt|ady: fuff 2 clubs  |pg||
nt|athene: because you need to use it as transportation|pg||
nt|athene: ping-pong here :) declarer doesn't read the diamonds|pg||
mc|9|nt|ady: another 7 to england|pg||
nt|panja: perhaps, West was thinking of a @H honour lead vs. 1Nt....and skipped backtracking although bidding continue further..?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: East was a bit too passive there.  |pg||
nt|mariner1: one problem with those type calls is they become considerably less effective as|pg||
nt|mariner1: the level of opponents increases......... they need to be fit well into the overall|pg||
nt|mariner1: structure of a system|pg||
nt|hedyg: might be difficult to avoid 4@h|pg||
nt|athene: well, even though E-W beat 1nt, they would have scored better in 2@S, i think|pg||
nt|panja: a slam on board 16....a GS even|pg||
mb|1H|nt|finch: 10 tricks NS is a surprisingly large number|pg||
nt|dburn: not often Brown and Stockdale stop in 2NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS should force more in @D here than in Open Room|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S NS and out|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mariner1: I see 11,,, would have to come up with 12th....... lead could help if played in E|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6N is what I see them in|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mariner1: EW are finding out if you sit on your hands you will lose a lot of tournaments and|pg||
nt|mariner1: have flat hands............|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S partial EW.... game off best defense|pg||
nt|ady: a partial in hearts seems the best on this hand    only 3 top losers   but with the 4-1 trump break  game seems to much|pg||
nt|athene: it should be possible to have a fairly smooth auction|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|athene: the Polish 1@C opener is very vulnerable to pre-emption, i think|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT here for EW |pg||
nt|sybarra: one of THE best |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: is it? without a spade lead at trick one, there seem to be ten winners|pg||
nt|ady: well they have got a 22pt semi mis fit|pg||
nt|finch: yes, but only if you take the first diamond|pg||
nt|athene: and it's something which is really not exploited as much as it could be|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S 2@D 2@H 3@H|pg||
nt|Gerben42: really taking the fun outta it, arent you|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: assuming that's forcing of course :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: 6 in reach, not sure there's much chance of them getting to 7|pg||
nt|panja: the only problem is West's stiff @D opposite the 2@D bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: best played by W I think |pg||
nt|othered1: No game makes here, either way|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: 1@h? is that some cunning plan?|pg||
nt|finch: it would a more amusing cunning plan NV|pg||
nt|mariner1: S has no reall attractive call here,,,,,,, I do not particularly like 1N with KQ stiff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, all calls seem to have one or more major flaws|pg||
nt|mariner1: Mike do you like the 1N? (2@C regrettable @c might be my call)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: so EW must play some sort of forcing @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: now we find out whether 2@d was gf|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|athene: yes, it will be hard for E-W to diagnose that the @DK isn't a worry|pg||
nt|panja: with this layout, W can simply ask aces and get to the grand..|pg||
nt|panja: what does W need? three key cards, and the trump Q..|pg||
nt|athene: actually having said all that, the grand isn't absolutely laydown - but it's pretty good|pg||
nt|othered1: but both 4@H and 5@D are reasonable shots|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  Everton win penalty shootout|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not with KQ stiff, and 2@C should really be a better suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N makes NS, hard to bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: not much to this one|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn: 3@h certainly seems to suggest some artifice - a passed hand facing a vulnerable overcall ought to bid more than that|pg||
nt|finch: 3@H appears to be limit raise values (or more), so perahps South should have seen it through with 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: it wasnt|pg||
nt|ady: not|pg||
nt|ady: trump leads look best|pg||
nt|oliverc: If 2@D is GF then 3@H is very definitely slam-invitational here, so we should get some|pg||
nt|oliverc: cue-bidding|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: a heard lead might kill 3 no|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mariner1: and has to play @D the only way that works|pg||
nt|panja: and...4-card trump support..which is not very clear yet|pg||
nt|chthonic: If EW get to 5D, North had better lead a spade -- and that is unlikely. |pg||
pc|hA|nt|oliverc: now a rolling 4@H perhaps|pg||
nt|frankaus: not easy to lead @H|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: or a club with a h back|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: any way 2 spade and 3 club tricks|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I guess 3@h has good chances|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree, but on @C lead, west still has a trump guess of sorts|pg||
pc|cA|nt|finch: this may well take more tricks than it technically should, because the defence will not have the right idea|pg||
nt|dburn: again, declarer has pretty much the same ten top tricks as in 2NT without a spade attack|pg||
nt|finch: in fact I think it makes a load of tricks anyway with no entry to the diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: she can make 10 with all cards in view, not sure about single dummy|pg||
nt|finch: best is to take two hearts before touching clubs, but in practice she might win the heart and play a second club at once|pg||
nt|thegarve:  she will probably assume a@s is with West|pg||
nt|ady: dont think 3NT appeals -  singleton diamond  and opposite a passed hand   10C makes the hand good in no-trumps|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe I need coffee........ just reminded 4@S 3@H 2@D and 3@C are 12 :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: so what do you bid with S over the 1@S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: small @H in case pd has a stiff high honour|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so a good pass here|pg||
nt|frankaus: nice stop|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: wow!|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: after all the best lead! i see 7 tricks only|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4th from L&S  often the best|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: not an easy hand to play |pg||
nt|athene: west has the perfect hand, so 6@C makes|pg||
nt|athene: 5@S now asking for @HQ and other assorted goodies|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|panja: if W bids 5@S now..E should simply bid 7...should he not?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|granguru: @C-@H squeeze for 7NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: so the slam is easier than I 1st "envisioned"|pg||
nt|granguru: After 4@S and @DAK S cant hold both rounded suits|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: not alwasy easy to do when that suit was bid on right|pg||
nt|sybarra: *on your right |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: perhaps this is the unbiddable hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: borrow a @H from last deck..|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now moment to show good defence!|pg||
nt|frankaus: sneakie @S |pg||
nt|frankaus: bur S will get it right|pg||
nt|frankaus: *but|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: polish defence play is among the best in the world for sure|pg||
pc|hK|nt|finch: If West's double denied four spades (as it appears from the auction), she'll get a count of the hand in due course|pg||
nt|othered1: And without @Dlead, this has chances, too|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|finch: 3NT may not immediately appeal, but you have to compare it with the thought of playing 3@H|pg||
nt|xenya: now a club should hold it|pg||
mc|10|nt|granguru: But E can also go for the @CJ  finesse which is bad this time|pg||
nt|granguru: 6NT from top|pg||
nt|athene: east could see pretty much how the play would go - the @DAKQ can be used for fast discards|pg||
nt|frankaus: another commetators curse :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: now over the 2@S by E in Open Room I would have to bid 2N with S,,,,,,, DBL|pg||
nt|mariner1: and PASS are not options|pg||
nt|oliverc: Not, one suspects, what North was dying to hear|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: 2@D multi, showing a bad weak two in a major or various strong hands|pg||
nt|ady: good save by wales in OR  5@H|pg||
nt|thegarve:  should get to 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: lets try again  |pg||
nt|athene: well it cld be worse -  he has a pretty good hand in support of minors|pg||
nt|athene: three useful honours|pg||
nt|athene: the only problem is, as 1NT is weak, he may imagine that 2NT has to be constructive|pg||

mb|p|pc|hA|nt|thegarve:  West is unlikely to save looking at least 3 defensive tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: not completely clear to save over it - that West hand has some defensive prospects|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has play here|pg||
nt|athene: interesting - i wonder if south's lack of double was judgement or system|pg||
nt|oliverc: West going to be disappointed, though, if he ends up doubling 3@D|pg||
nt|athene: but the double has probably alerted him to what is going on|pg||
nt|sybarra: S thought for a moment before playing low |pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS will presumably have little trouble reaching a red-suit game, or perhaps 3NT|pg||
nt|chthonic: Seems normal to get to 4H, but now there will have to be some interesting acrobatics to do so|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Marshall!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps NS are playing negative free bids, as otherwise the neg double would seem a somewhat eccentric choice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi ed & craig|pg||
nt|othered1: Luckily, EW's @S fit isn't good enough to up the ante before south's second chance|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: looks cold in fact with the pointed Aces set right|pg||
nt|sybarra: will need the @H guess |pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Rob |pg||
nt|sybarra: a likely 3 nt for n/s here |pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: think South will have to get to 4@S herself|pg||
nt|dburn: so the Welsh West, Jean Hand, took a pretty good decision|pg||
nt|thegarve:  if she passes 2@s it would only be 50s - an old ploy|pg||
nt|finch: at the other table West guessed well, although I don't think that weak two was a 'bad' one|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S off, @H off, at lead @c are 3 3,,,,,, @D could be worse|pg||
nt|mariner1: has no real choice I think and the 3@D call helps define the play|pg||
nt|hedyg: unfriendly hand|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. i wonder if double would have been artificial|pg||
nt|sybarra: didnt feel like reflex here |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 5 clubs any body?|pg||
nt|chthonic: Of course, 3NT makes|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ady: west  could lead a top spade  and then decide|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c in EW|pg||
nt|hedyg: but no way to bid it|pg||
nt|ady: yes    e/w could make 2@C   but could not really get into the bidding|pg||
nt|ady: you got there ffirst Heddy|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs a miracle in @D and there is no such thing|pg||
nt|ady: wont go down if they dont play a card|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: making at least 4 |pg||
nt|athene: if i passed 1nt i would surely double 2@S for t/o though|pg||
nt|chthonic: Good bid!|pg||
nt|othered1: can they avoid 4@H simply by never getting their 8-card fit into the auction?|pg||
nt|chthonic: South should be happy with that development.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: careful defense sinks this|pg||
pc|d5|nt|finch: 5@H more of a 2-way shot, could collect x AQxxxx Qxxx xx and make on a good day|pg||
nt|dburn: no saves now - Seale adopting more of a Manchester United approach than an Everton approach to saving|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N in N I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: undo please operator :)|pg||
nt|athene: if pass was neutral, surely south should have bid 3@D himself with 6-5?|pg||
nt|athene: length more important than the extra honour|pg||
nt|oliverc: I would have thought so|pg||
nt|athene: ah ok 2nt wasn't specifically minors|pg||
nt|oliverc: interesting treatment|pg||
nt|othered1: If north hasn't implied long @C, some minimums could produce slam if there isn't serious @C duplication|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mariner1: 4@H tough spot|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder what strength they play it as?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: whatever Bill... it is not often that you dont bid at all with 19 points|pg||
nt|athene: but south does have a very defensive hand|pg||
nt|athene: so prefers to just try for some 50s rather than risking going down at the 3-level|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: can cash for 10 tricks |pg||
pc|s3|nt|chthonic: Very surprising|pg||
nt|othered1: Feels like this isn't a very good layout for their style, unless someone has taken a position about a forcing bid.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphznh: sry the connection is very bad|pg||
nt|hedyg: still waiting for the @D spots to change|pg||
nt|ady: could make if spade position favourable    but not that difficult hand to play   |pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like connection problems, he really does not have that many choices|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: operator?|pg||
nt|athene: if you are going to bid it on very weak hands like south, you can't really use it for strong ones too|pg||
nt|panja: against, perhaps a trump lead might have been better?|pg||

nt|mariner1: some interesting breaks here|pg||
nt|mariner1: and well done|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 of either major here.......|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: another slam coming up|pg||
nt|oliverc: still, cheaper than 3@DX= LOL|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt by N or S will be easy to defeat on B18|pg||
nt|panja: will not be ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: may play @H's again as a sac |pg||
nt|chthonic: So easy when we see the cards.|pg||
nt|mariner1: migth win and imp or 2 anyway|pg||
nt|mariner1: might|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: not easy to defeat, but not easy to reach either, after 1@S 2@D 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: i guess west might not think he is quite worth 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: having three small diamonds and 4333 AND minimum hcp|pg||
mb|1D|nt|oliverc: green vs red, tho|pg||
nt|chthonic: So here, we presume 4S making 5.... wonder what could go wrong with that?  NS vul and no reasonable save.  |pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: 2 red aces to lose in hearts for n/s|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3 @S plays well EW here|pg||
nt|athene: let's see if they can get all the marks and play 6nt|pg||
nt|athene: north can double now|pg||
nt|athene: a little bit light on hcp perhaps but the ideal shape for it|pg||
nt|athene: on the other hand, HE is red vs. green :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: indeed|pg||
nt|athene: if the @SQ were in hearts i think it's right to double |pg||
nt|panja: if the overcall could be weak..North will probably pass|pg||
nt|frankaus: how many 1H now?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNNG ****  LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  SCOTLAND 91, N-IRELAND 88, ENGLAND 81, IRELAND  72, CBAI 71, WALES 43 ****|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS could be in trouble with a @H game|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  might get to 4@S    but will fail either on a heart l ead or clyb|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3@H 4 me|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now 6 spades is down on the b, but 6 clubs makes on carefull playad spade break|pg||
nt|chthonic: So we expect a push board.....|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: as it is...maybe it will cause partner to misjudge (i.e. think you have something :) )|pg||
nt|athene: but misjudging will work very well for N-S if it gets them to 3nt :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: Not sure I'd find a double with the North cards here, but this should work out well|pg||
nt|panja: South wants to try 3N now...but how does he figure out the @S position?|pg||
nt|athene: hard for N-S to work out they have a spade stopper between them|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 clubs my preference |pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: can actually make 5  cant they |pg||
mb|p|nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNNG ****  LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  SCOTLAND 91, N-IRELAND 88, ENGLAND 81, IRELAND  72, CBAI 71, WALES 43 ****|pg||
nt|ady: north took the quick root|pg||
nt|ady: club|pg||
nt|athene: double might help them|pg||
nt|athene: north can pass, showing a little something in spades|pg||
nt|frankaus: pass is a nice bid by 2@C openener|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: after all only 26 combined high c points- so 4 spade is my guess|pg||
nt|othered1: some might bid 3@S with east's fit, assuming 2@H was a simple transfer|pg||
nt|sga1: 1@s is a bold bid with 2 Js|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: still not much in it - one swing in either match could win the Lady Milne for Northern Ireland|pg||
nt|mariner1: well W ensures the @H will not be bid NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West did well to make 3@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 of a major that is |pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N here shows minors over the @c|pg||
nt|Gerben42: very :)|pg||
nt|sga1: and nice @s suit.|pg||
nt|mariner1: bold is a nice word :)|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: with poker chance:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: players under 30 are often bold |pg||
nt|mariner1: well EW make some @H so this will be good|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: 3@S can be beat though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it certainly looks like it|pg||
nt|mariner1: off 4 best defense|pg||
nt|oliverc: A little something is all South needs|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt has to be right now|pg||
nt|panja: a little courage, do you mean?|pg||
nt|athene: unless you have the firm agreement that north's pass over the double specifically shows a very bad hand (which i can't believe they have)|pg||
nt|chthonic: Losing two clubs after drawing trumps.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: EW can make upto 4@h with correct @s guess.|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  dug up the ground inbetween|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Edgar Kaplan used to say that take-out doubles should be taken out|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S   competitive   so east right to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N has a play,,,|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to duck 1st @S if led|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and this may be a perfect example|pg||
nt|sybarra: pointed out be spec,  even 6 @D can make on the layut for e/w |pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: north can't bid 6nt as they might be off @HK and @CA|pg||
nt|oliverc: wow, that's a little unexpected. lots of ways for this to be defeated, even with the|pg||
nt|oliverc: KJX@H onside|pg||
nt|athene: with nothing in spades and a fifth heart, north should bid 4@H over 3@SX, maybe...but not easy at all|pg||
nt|panja: this should make...|pg||
nt|panja: he will need to ruff third Spade for the second entry|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@H X is still t/o by my methods|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but this is more certain $$$|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: this could get tricky |pg||
nt|athene: trump lead helps declarer a lot|pg||
nt|oliverc: a trump lead is not one of them, though|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am with you franak |pg||
nt|mariner1: well if they only get it 1 they lose I think|pg||
nt|Gerben42: thist ime bold didnt work|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: and a heart lead wld be embarrassing :)|pg||
nt|athene: excellently done in the open room to flatten 6@C|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: how would you treat  a double on 3 hearts?|pg||
nt|sybarra: *frank |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: will certainly make this now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mariner1: 3N was a better spot,, K@S lead helps a lot|pg||
nt|ady: can beat 3 |pg||
nt|oliverc: yes|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mariner1: he does have one entry to dummy coming|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|mariner1: no way to prevent a @D loser it seems|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, @C position doesn't need a ruff to set up 4th @C|pg||
nt|Gerben42: ducking @CA would have been better, but the doubleton lead is not that easy to know|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mariner1: looks like off 2 now|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: they need to do this right to get all the @D tricks |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: if x on 3 hearts is to double on 4 is pen|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: 3 diamonds a make   so nothing lost|pg||
nt|panja: not done yet...|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3@H X is t/o|pg||

nt|finch: south learnt not to claim with any trumps outstanding|pg||

nt|sybarra: as I am reminded "only 4 imps" |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes they were lucky there is this close a match|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 imps in a 6 - 7 match is huge....... lead vs being behind|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests there was the risk (from north's point of view) that opps had @CAK to cash|pg||
nt|athene: this is true but it's extremely unlikely|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board 13 was my kind of slam, around 10%|pg||
nt|oliverc: right|pg||

nt|mariner1:  http://tinyurl.com/oh5tmv  -  running scores|pg||

nt|mariner1: Giro d'Italia|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: ok, they're back|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: South missed an inference there - if North was strong, he could have bid 2@S for take-out a round earlier|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: easy 4 heart here|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  maybe not if West cashes a@h v 4@S and underleads the @ds|pg||
nt|ady: 4@s  a make for e/w   |pg||
nt|athene: there's a principle names after someone-or-other, isn't there, saying that it's better to play in the weaker of your two fits|pg||
nt|athene: *named|pg||
nt|panja: 6@h should make even on a @C lead..|pg||
nt|athene: you want the solid suit to be side suit and the weak one to be trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I doubt that this will be flat|pg||
nt|panja: exchange one of West's @S with East's small @H..and 6@H won't make|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: if you get paranoid about these things you miss a lot of slams and make life much harder for yourself|pg||
nt|chthonic: Narrowing the gap to nine IMPs.  Increasing the interest and the tension.  |pg||
nt|othered1: Guess they found no @D lead there, either.|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: that would get you into the papers|pg||
nt|thegarve:  get 4@s two off|pg||
nt|mariner1: we started a little late so I am NOT sure when the next session from Greece|pg||
nt|mariner1: will start.|pg||
nt|mariner1: be sure to check the vugraph schedule for the many vugraphs Roland has|pg||
nt|mariner1: scheduled this weekend! -|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|athene: hard for it to be flat without being the same contract|pg||
nt|Walddk4: or make spades be 3-1|pg||
nt|athene: is there anything else that adds up to 1620?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but will they reach it?|pg||
nt|frankaus: peter hall - has a good chapter on competative X's in his book competative bidding at pairs - well worth a read|pg||
nt|sga1: Let us see whether NS can stop at 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: in 8 bd matches,  tough to lose a hand lke that and recover |pg||
nt|athene: i suppose e-w might go 3 down redoubled - but that's still 1 imp difference|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: east will surely double if north cues clubs at any point|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@H: non-minimum, no shortage. I agree with non-minimum. This is a very good 13 count|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 14, sorry|pg||
nt|athene: it's a very good 14 count, even :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: they must play 3 @D stronger than I do |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: n/s play a club system (perhaps orange club)  and 1 @D =07 |pg||
nt|mariner1: EW might make 4@H here,,,,,,,, 3N has an issue|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: well-judged from west; 2@H might miss the game|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: running scores: http://tinyurl.com/oh5tmv|pg||
nt|othered1: Oh, you meant board 17|pg||
nt|chthonic: Can EW find the way to five tricks?  |pg||
nt|sga1: Now will reach 3@S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|finch: more plausible is one top diamond first|pg||
nt|ady: it is a possibility|pg||
nt|thegarve:  switch to q@d to get an enc/disc signal|pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland has many excellent vugraphs on the schedule this weekend!|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: after all south hand is pretty ugly|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so there is an inference that North is just protecting with good shape  |pg||
nt|ady: 5@H   save to much if they find best defence|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt = spade cue?|pg||
nt|chthonic: Against NT, AK and a diamond, followed by a heart shift.  All quite double dummy, though.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: double major fit get E/W going to game|pg||
nt|chthonic: Well...... maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: if diamonds are 5332 with partner having the doubleton you look a bit silly underleading the first round|pg||
nt|sybarra: well true |pg||
nt|othered1: They can take 6 quick ones by your line, but it sitll won'd be clear here|pg||
nt|chthonic: But not in game, either|pg||
nt|othered1: still it would be nice to get a plus EW|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Gerben42: very disciplined from S|pg||
nt|mariner1: well they can make 4@S if they find Q@S which is not likely|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: either that, or just shows general happiness without being able to cue 4minor|pg||
nt|oliverc: or maybe denying a Club cue|pg||
nt|othered1: East does know that west won't have much at all, so actual lie is a possible consideration|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: am told its a sort of polish club with variations |pg||
nt|mariner1: ok a @D lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think its very close to the orange club via Jan Jansma |pg||
nt|athene: this is too costly|pg||
nt|athene: as long as the defence stay away from clubs declarer must lose two tricks in each side suit|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so 2 off here is good for east west, bec 4 h is diff to reach|pg||
nt|frankaus: loser in each suit if they defend accuratly|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|thegarve:  hmm|pg||
nt|athene: 1100|pg||
nt|athene: the main thing is for south to NOT bid 4@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Dbl gave the @SQ away|pg||
nt|sga1: yes I agree|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: but if they mix firsts and seconds....|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now that East got the chance to double clubs at a lowish level, he will not double 6@H|pg||
nt|athene: this is where that style doesn't work so well|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chthonic: No, it was very difficult, indeed|pg||
nt|othered1: And now it's about overtricks|pg||
nt|mariner1: my aunt Matida said 8 ever 9 never|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mariner1: and off from the top now|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mariner1: he may not try the hook only in 3@S anyway|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|finch: not sure what's percentage here. Partner could have singleton @SJ and declarer the @DJ|pg||
nt|sga1: That is right but another theory says "Look at your hand/dummy, if singleton somehere then trump m,ay break 3-1.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: my least favorite rule *g|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h3|nt|frankaus: now thw need to take care the A of trupms does not run away :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: as spec pointed out bd 22 4H (vuln) was cold for EW 650,so loss may be 150|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: both N AND S have soft values and no distribution... so bad bid|pg||
nt|oliverc: still going to be 12 IMPs away even if South makes this|pg||
nt|athene: well i am not sure about what was going on in this auction, precisely - it seems to me that north couldn't bid 4NT blackwood with confidence|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|nt|athene: he could if he knew for sure that south DID (or DIDN'T) have the @DA|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: south obviously thought that the double of 3@D was inviting a sac|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|s4|nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board of the session........... many many vugraphs on|pg||

nt|sybarra: last hand for this match |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to our operator. (sorry do not know your name)  Job well done |pg||
nt|oliverc: Bridge is a cruel game sometimes. You wouldn't expect to lose 12 IMPs when you|pg||
nt|oliverc: bid and make a slam like this|pg||
nt|athene: N-S will be marking that one down as a good board, i think :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: quite|pg||

nt|chthonic: Still, that is a potential swing, if they get to 3NT in other room.  |pg||
nt|Gerben42: 8 ever 9 never is only a 4% edge, but playing for 3-1 with a singleton is fooling yourself|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N better than 4@H here EW|pg||
mb|1D|nt|finch: yes. I admit the play was so fast that it's not obvious that defence occurred to West and was rejected|pg||

nt|marlowepi: the last time i made a prediction like that they stopped in 4D|pg||

nt|vugraphznh: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also those who helped bring this Bridge Festival to BBO  |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: the NS aggression may backfire here - East may raise 2NT to 3NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: we have Norway and Indonesia and many many more coming up|pg||

nt|hedyg: wow|pg||
nt|ady: 16 is entered as 2@C -2|pg||

nt|hedyg: well then my bet is 1@c-1@H-1NT-2@c-p (forgot that 2@c is checkback)|pg||
nt|hedyg: can you pls enter the results?|pg||
nt|ady: yes   could be|pg||
nt|hedyg: or give us the result of the match|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time Angelini seems to have won the Italian team championships|pg||
nt|vugraphznh: ok we will be  back from reece in 10 min i hope without con. problems this time|pg||
nt|sybarra: and to the specs, who are always helpful.  I enjoy your comments |pg||
nt|athene: as usual, it's not good for all the strength to be massed in one hand|pg||
nt|athene: no way for west to get in and put the @DQ through|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the @S honours shd provide parking place for the @D|pg||
nt|athene: playing 2@D wld be more fun for E-W than defending 1NT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: looks like 2@d  is the limit  n/s|pg||
nt|ady: I think 1NT better 2nd bit by east    |pg||
nt|athene: so the defence can't get their four tricks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: yes and not the easiest play,,,, is possible|pg||
nt|mariner1: good to see a player that knows an invitation can be refused|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: declarer just leads up to @SKQ and pitches @D - right|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mariner1: easier now|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 spades is to play not an invitation if north has spades i thk, only if north has hearts he should bid on, but here 4 spades makes on the h finess|pg||
pc|h9|nt|finch: I admit I'd have led my AK suit. Dummy is known to be short in diamonds|pg||
nt|thegarve:  why not a@H?|pg||
nt|granguru: establishing the @H might also help|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unfortunately (or rather not, as it is a flat board) this is an occasion when it would be a good time to accept |pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not a great game, but lucky enough|pg||
nt|mariner1: on board 6 Open Room found the 4@H now to make it|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|ady: dont like A@D lead    why not A@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bad news in clubs, but good news in diamonds  |pg||
nt|othered1: There's room for declarer to go wrong here in @C|pg||
nt|chthonic: Declarer must just negotiate the club jack.  After the club and and the third heart, does he drop or finesse?|pg||
nt|chthonic: oh, they blocked the hearts...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS have blocked heart suit|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes now has a couple of ways to make it and both work|pg||
nt|granguru: to avoid losing @Cs..the @C return made things much more easy|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: so a push.,|pg||
nt|granguru: so it is a tie..in this board|pg||
nt|mariner1: thanks all!|pg||
nt|granguru: tks all|pg||
nt|granguru: see you soon|pg||
nt|mariner1: many many more vugraphs coming up!  Roland has been busy!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: assume the dbl showed at least 1 major  better not to commit west to another bid and limit with 1NT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: did NS bid to help them?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: this hand comes tumbling home |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: the @H8 back would be an odd card to return, in standard methods, which I assume NS are not using|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|mariner1: only a 1@D opener, N passed it|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|xenya: actually the @D continuation might have defeated the contract?|pg||
nt|finch: that's a nice play in clubs. gains with Ax and also on this layout|pg||
nt|ady: spec has requested address to find previous results|pg||
pc|h6|nt|finch: although from South's perspective, if North's 5 was a true card it's either a singleton or J95|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: it doesnt , clubs were played twice , well done on defence|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|sybarra: the pitches on @S will be difficult for S |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mariner1: well this is one of those STOM hands..... and could decide mathc|pg||
nt|mariner1: STOM - state of match|pg||
nt|sybarra: they might just bid at other table if they think they need it |pg||
nt|mariner1: well a 16 imp lead "should" be safe|pg||

nt|oliverc: no|pg||
nt|oliverc: me either|pg||
nt|oliverc: nothing to be gained|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he was hoping that east might duck it if he had the @CK|pg||
nt|athene: expecting it to be repeated|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is an even pip but a VERY odd card|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: and 4 here was reasonable however not the optimum spot|pg||
nt|sga1: Good board for EW to bid upto 5@c|pg||
nt|mariner1: last hand I meant|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: whereas he wouldn't duck a club to the unsupported @CQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: now E/W will get too high|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: a fine opening i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: AJ10x is worth a lot more than 5 hcp|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N EW could be an issue though|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: likely to be same contract as OR|pg||
nt|athene: another slam (grand slam in fact) dependent on the right void|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H from south now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|xenya: oh yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: risky without discussion - and 1@D might be some strong hands, perhaps, which would make it doubly risky|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: not a triumph for either N-S pair|pg||
nt|athene: 7@S is perhaps a bit much to ask but you should be in six, i think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the other match:  5@S +2    6@S+1|pg||
nt|sybarra: very few imps changing hands in this match so far, 2 each |pg||
mb|p|pc|s5|nt|othered1: @C suit presents some problems for declarer here|pg||
nt|sga1: Goes down on @S lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mariner1: and the @S lead should doom this|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes the @S lead was the issue|pg||
pc|sA|nt|thegarve:  oh oh|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: great lead|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but the last 2 could bring a change|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|thegarve:  I'm sure west is happy now that she did not overcall 1@S|pg||
nt|oliverc: Not sure I could bring myself to pass 3NT with this South hand|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: and lead of 8 also may have cost a trick when west overtook|pg||
pc|h4|pc|sQ|nt|thegarve:  A@c lead and its a  disaster|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|finch: Seale looking for an immediate spade ruff, but I think the 7-card fit is quite lokely from the auction|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 7 NS bid the 4@S however did not find Q@S so off|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: this will drift down 1    to west's relief   better to take a likely plus in 4@S|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c5|pc|s8|nt|janhamhurg: and remember: most players in Poland use a similar system, so its mostly individuell mistakes that score|pg||

pc|s6|pc|d5|pc|cT|nt|finch: Don't get this - why not take the ruffing club finesse at trick 2? Yout have an entry back to dummy|pg||

nt|xenya: who is to blame here? S for trying to find a few specific cards with N for a slam to be good, or N for converting to 4@S?|pg||
nt|athene: no, with a marked 2-suiter (5-5 or more extreme), 3nt is very rarely going to be right|pg||
nt|athene: if partner is strong enough for both suits to run, you are going to make slam|pg||
nt|athene: and if he isn't, just running one suit isn't going to give you enough tricks for 3nt|pg||
nt|oliverc: absolutely, Bill|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: here decl could have made 3, but just 1 imp--|pg||
nt|othered1: That was certainly a favorable result for NS|pg||
nt|mariner1: so off 2 trying to make it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: bd 6 e/w played 4 @S in the other foom |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|thegarve:  an exciting board |pg||
nt|sybarra: *room |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: is south an opener?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: part scores here although action is possible|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|finch: you would do well to bid to 6@D. You would also do well to make it; it's not obvious what the right line is|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S now from south perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: he can't have much more and not overcall 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he isn't sure what the double means - but it was t/o last time :)|pg||
nt|othered1: EW can try for slam on the @C finesse, and west might have to pull in a notch or two with all those cards and @D support|pg||
mb|2S|nt|oliverc: I have never been a fan of Weak jump-shifts that aren't based on at least a decent|pg||
nt|oliverc: tolerance for partner's suit|pg||
nt|oliverc: trump leads will give West no chance here|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  should make 6NT by playing q@s from hand without releasing a@S to attempt to create an entry to dummy |pg||
nt|dburn: maybe they can duck|pg||
nt|athene: well 3@D looks intermediate to me...but there's surely risk of losing hearts? perhaps it shows 4@H6@D or something weird|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont mind it,  as long as I am playing with pard's where I can get out |pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H pass or correct|pg||
nt|mariner1: N should pass,,,, his AJ @S is good as 3|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dburn: but I agree, it's not at all clear|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  you can play a 3@S reponse to 2@C as 4@S and 5@D|pg||
nt|finch: obviously you can make double dummy after the @SQ holds by enplaying North. |pg||
nt|thegarve:  or 2@c 2@d 3@s as 4!@S and 5@d from declarer too|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: But east has gotten @S into the picture and west knows his fit there isn't very good.|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: maybe you should do... win the lead, queen of spades winning, ace of spades, oops, what else is there to play for?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: all 2 no bids are forcing|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk4: We are in Wroclaw (German: Breslau), the chief city of the historical region of Lower Silesia in south-western Poland, situated on the Oder river|pg||
nt|mariner1: N lucky the @D are 2 2|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|finch: 6@S however is not going to make|pg||
nt|ady: can then cash all clubs  and try diamonds    and end play North|pg||
nt|ady: was afraid they might find that|pg||
nt|frankaus: not 4 me - but in poland good hands are opened 1@C so more likely that the hand will be opened|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|xenya: well looking at EW's hands, 6@S doesn't look all that bad|pg||
nt|thegarve:  a little sad that you do not possess 9@s|pg||
nt|finch: yes, single dummy 6@S looks a pretty good spot. You would have been worried about a heart lead in 6NT|pg||
nt|thegarve:  no-one has 9 0r 10 asks even in relay systems|pg||
nt|chthonic: One IMP away on last board, when declarer played first one club -- the king, and it was ducked.  Then went on with spades and diamonds, making ten tricks.|pg||
nt|othered1: @H lead is good and indicated by the auction (if 3@C is natural), so delcarer likely will get only 10 tricks here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|janhamhurg: and repeating the opening suit shows min, so no trouble here|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: declarer is likely to get the clubs wrong|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see how he will be able to get a count on east's hand|pg||
nt|athene: the only thing that might force him to play right is lack of dummy entries to take the double finesse against the @CK10|pg||

nt|ady: looks like 3NT has the best chance - likely club lead|pg||
nt|finch: no, the later ruff discard West conceded let it through|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNNG ****  LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  SCOTLAND 90, N-IRELAND 88, ENGLAND 82, IRELAND  72, CBAI 72, WALES 42 ****|pg||
nt|thegarve:  3NT makes sense if its natural|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: lets see who bids spades first|pg||
nt|chthonic: The lead is growing again, so PETRO needs a swing.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|sybarra: 2 @d ?  or?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|sybarra: 3 @D I mean |pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  England striding on|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3@S is quite aggressive but they still have lots of room to do their little dance and stop in 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: 1NT with a five card major -- the ongoing debate.  With two unstopped side suits, I would not be tempted, |pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: club lead in OR  and later a ruff and discard|pg||
nt|ady: this looks like down 2|pg||
nt|thegarve:  NI down by 1 and Scotland up by 4 so its down to the wire|pg||
nt|athene: but south must like his @DK and @CA|pg||
nt|athene: @SX @HKQx @DAQxxx @Cxxxx hardly impossible for south's bidding?|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he needs the @DJ with all that to make slam good|pg||
nt|sybarra: and yet another 2 nt |pg||
nt|frankaus: @S lead will help declarer|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: may be the spec can help- i thk this hand could be opened with 1 dia having a 3 club in revers|pg||
nt|chthonic: and this should be down easily.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N showing a limit raise maybe with 3 cards|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: 1NT not terribly attractive with two dead black suit holdings, especially if you don;t play Puppet (or have some other way of disclosing 5th heart in time). of course, the choice ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: of opening all depends on whether you are willing to raise a 1NT response to 2NT. i would be on this S hand, so I would open 1H|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|janhamhurg: this beats 2 no|pg||
nt|frankaus: @H lead sets it - wd|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|athene: @SA, @DK, spade ruff, then @DAQ pitching a club, and 4th diamond|pg||
nt|athene: if east follows you pitch another club|pg||
nt|athene: when he shows out you can ruff and ruff another spade|pg||
nt|oliverc: works for me :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|xenya: likely 2 off, yes|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: nothing too interesting here - should be flat|pg||
nt|mariner1: S can get his ruff however that is last trick|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|athene: as with 6@S a moment ago, 6NT was objectively better|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|c6|nt|thegarve:  If England had put a decent score down in the first half of this match they would have had a very feint chance|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNNG ****  LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  SCOTLAND 90, N-IRELAND 89, ENGLAND 82, CBAI 72, IRELAND 71, WALES 42 ****|pg||
pc|c9|nt|oliverc: hmmmm]|pg||
nt|athene: declarer went for the spade ruffs in the other room and ended with 11 (although when he led the last diamond, east ruffed, according to the movie, so he cld have pitched @C loser ...|pg||
nt|athene: for 12 - i think the movie is wrong)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|chthonic: When you KNOW the right defense, take charge!|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|nt|athene: but you would be entitled to feel a bit unlucky if opps started @CA, @C ruff against this |pg||

nt|athene: 2@C weakish both majors...if 3@H is invitational he will bid it, with two aces|pg||

nt|athene: but it's hard to criticize E-W for missing this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but without that, the @DQ comes down so there are two pitches for dummy's clubs|pg||

mb|p|nt|oliverc: Maybe 3@H was pre-emptive rather than invityational|pg||
pc|c2|nt|janhamhurg: this fit is just a perfekt 1 25 points with a solid 7 card suit- may be 3 spade instead of 4 would have helped to find the fit|pg||

pc|d2|nt|finch: West should have worked out what to do on this card before playing the third club - she knew someone was going to ruff it|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: of course 4@H doesn't make :) you must lose a spade and three clubs|pg||

pc|h2|nt|athene: but north gave a ruff/discard in the other room|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: E wins to avoid a diamond shift, also hoping that C king was singleton, which is fairly likely|pg||

nt|thegarve:  assumes North had Qxxx to duck the @s|pg||
nt|finch: ducking isn't silly. North must be fairly confident it's making if West has the AK|pg||
