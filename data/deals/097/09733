mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|josj: I was about to say that 1nt can go down, as was proved in CR|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|josj: well, not on this lead...(1nt that is)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|boltonian2: well, one more trick on this lead|pg||
nt|boltonian2: just 2 more to go|pg||
nt|josj: the duck hands back the present :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Clever birds, those ducks|pg||
nt|josj: but @H frozen now|pg||
nt|josj: frozen duck? |pg||
nt|josj: :)|pg||
nt|boltonian2: a @D looks attractive from the E hand if decides not to continue :Hs|pg||
nt|cuttysark: These overbid contracts are often hard to defend - a diamond now is lethal, but how can East tell|pg||
nt|boltonian2: well, the overbid is on the table...|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|nt|cuttysark: So it is :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|josj: another present, difficult to be refused this time|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|boltonian2: i'm not sure what the advantge of a spade over a diamond was...|pg||
nt|josj: declarer will tell you later, Alex|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|boltonian2: danger now is that W rises and hopes for the 9@H to be in his partners hand|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Hoping North had a doubleton spade, but would partner not lead a decent 4-card spade suit|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|nt|josj: wd Alex...|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Ouch. 1NT-1, 3NT tick, another day at the office|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|boltonian2: well, that is now 9 tricks as long as declarer is careful not to block the @Cs|pg||

nt|athene: east had the chance for a very modest suit-preference signal on the second heart, as a spec suggests|pg||
nt|athene: @HAK and you play @H2 then @H9|pg||
nt|athene: showing three hearts and interest in a diamond switch rather than the "obvious" club switch|pg||
nt|mariner1: well being conservative has worked  for NS this session, yet they are way|pg||
nt|mariner1: behind|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@S now........|pg||
nt|mariner1: Closed Room found it so NS have to bid it here|pg||
nt|mariner1: now the penultimate board of this session............|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: and now the real penultimate board of this session|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S made in Closed Room however no way to bid it 15 - 4|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Gee, how on earth do you get all the way to 4@S|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i like to open 2@h rather than 1@h on these type of hands in 3rd chair|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Roland, you mouse over the Closed room contract ... that's how|pg||
nt|mariner1: next session in 34 minutes and 32 seconds|pg||
nt|irwinbo: fifty per cent slams vul have to be bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@C W?|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Roland may have been asking more of a metaphysical question|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't even know that word, so no|pg||
nt|bjacobs: or just plain rhetorical ...|pg||
nt|mariner1: its all about the @c hook and no ruffs for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  in the closed room north gave south a lot of leeway as in 3rd seat|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: looks fair enough|pg||
nt|mariner1: wow  lot of bidding on the 4 count|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: not a good slam really|pg||
nt|athene: interesting from Klinger|pg||
pc|dK|nt|benjent: like "if a tree falls in a forest and no-one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, the big question is, can she make this to get a flat board?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|benjent: Looks like Diana needs to drop the @hK to make|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S has nice play here|pg||
nt|athene: 11 tricks does seem like a lot|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: should be able to put in the scores for the rest of the movie shortly after the next board hopefully|pg||
nt|athene: going very quietly with his 12 count facing an opening bid|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bjacobs: It does rather, and on that club lead, she will be thinking hard about West's shape|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5-2-5-1 the more likely shape|pg||
nt|bjacobs: OK, so if that's the case, her only hope would seem to be that the two hearts are small|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So win @CJ and run @H9?  A losing outcome, but reasonable|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|benjent: The @sA onside is a given (as in can't make without it), and West doesn't seem to have @dAK|pg||
nt|athene: of course the opening bid isn't, really :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: down on a club ruff as well as @CK off|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mariner1: well done|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: not sure how declarer can prevent the defence from taking two spades and the @CK at the very least|pg||
nt|athene: maybe a club lead in the other room|pg||
nt|serhat: now 12 tricks possible. |pg||
nt|athene: same lead in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: allowing the @SK9 to be discarded|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: not at all trivial how to play this|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps @DK, @HA, @DA for @H pitch, @C to @CQ|pg||
nt|athene: but declarer might decide he needs the heart finesse|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|athene: there are a couple of small clubs to deal with and he might decide he needs the @DA for one of those|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bjacobs: Great work |pg||
nt|benjent: Well done ... but I think she needed to play a spade up right then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She is smarter than us. No pun intended of course|pg||
nt|benjent: nope, she's ok|pg||
nt|serhat: declerer trying safe play|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|pitiful:  no one doubted that|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h6|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That she's smarter than us?|pg||
nt|athene: you could beat 4@S on a club ruff i guess|pg||
nt|mariner1: next session scheduled in 19 minutes so there will be a break before we|pg||
nt|mariner1: continue|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|athene: we'll never know if he was intending to run that @HJ :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes I would bet he was....... not sure he would later play Q@H though|pg||
nt|athene: it's very hard for West when the @HJ is led - not covering might be disastrous if declarer does need 2 heart tricks - you just gave him three|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: lost play sorry|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: np, play isn't too interesting on this one :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|pitiful:  yes :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Clearly "Smart" is smarter than "Pitiful", but ...|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|cT|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|athene: the heart discard is a diversionary move|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bjacobs: It was a very cool play to be honest.  Singleton honour was very much her best chance - also consistent with @C42 doubleton|pg||

nt|boltonian2: yes and another good score for BTN in the closed room here|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Looks like North went to the well once too often|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: N was simply unlucky that @D were 5-1|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|mb|2C|nt|cuttysark: Not so sure - opponents bidding suggested some distributional values|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|boltonian2: it was actually a good 3@C bid in the other room, not much chance here|pg||
nt|boltonian2: leaves North an awkward decision, does everyone know their agreement for 2NT on this sequence?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|cuttysark: I guess with the rest of the 2-level available it should be natural - not sure it is a good idea here, though|pg||

pc|h3|nt|athene: the reason you open 1nt is you are really stuck if you open 1@H and partner responds 1NT|pg||
nt|athene: south trying to get a signal from his partner|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.abf.com.au/events/anot/  - Tournament Site|pg||
nt|athene: but even with a discard the defence still don't cash the clubs|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 boards still to score|pg||
nt|athene: well - only dropping one trick in defence is better than average for 1nt passed out|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugrapha4: thankyou ll for watching/commentating ... see you all again after 'lunch'|pg||

nt|mariner1: thanks all! back in 17 minutes|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bjacobs: The counter argument is that they work well when you are the "overdog", because your weaker opponents won't know how to handle them|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|s8|nt|benjent: Yeah, but as the overdog, you would like to spend the entire match with everyone forced to play 2NT|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: if you pass, partner has a ten-count and you miss game; if you bid on, he has a 5 count, and you go negative|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: thanks all...|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx cu all shortly |pg||
nt|mariner1: thanks all!  back in 22 minutes or so|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: closing this room now|pg||
pc|s7|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|benjent: That is, you figure to win on general better playingness on regular hands. Try to keep the regular hands regular|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Too deep for me on a Sunday morning|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is true.  Tim Seres, Australia's best ever, said that he mainly wanted to see partscore hands - he knew he could win at those|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: Welcome back to the Autumn National Open Teams 2009, Adelaide, South|pg||
nt|mariner1: Australia, Australia,|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: hi again everyone|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Welcome back all for the last round today|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Afternoon Henry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are playing in Heaven|pg||
nt|mariner1: looks like 1@D here was a transfer to 4|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure about the N-S system - will try to hunt it out|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N makes since @D are 3 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: or commented together as they did in Perth in '89|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes weak suit, 6 cards, and 4 @S to boot in S|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: @C10 is a huge card|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can set up two spades in hand and reach them with the @C10|pg||
pc|c2|nt|benjent: vaguely possible to go down in 2@c here|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 1@C (semi-) natural, 1@D = hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: Irwin Boris, Bill Frisby and I are your commentators|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Welcome back all|pg||
nt|mariner1: Cricket is our super operator, hi Cricket!|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.abf.com.au/events/anot/  - Tournament Site|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Cheers for the lovely intro Rob :) hi all|pg||
pc|cA|nt|henryb: I would not dream of rebidding 2@c, which shows how much I know|pg||
nt|athene: if he didn't have that card the defence could cash @SAK and exit a diamond and play against dummy|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW might have derailed here if S remains quiet|pg||
nt|athene: diamond switch now might be worrying for him but @SJ and @DK both right for him so no reasonable line to fail here, i don't think|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bjacobs: They were forced to - with the Acol base (1NT rebid = 15-18)|pg||
nt|benjent: 1NT for you Henry?|pg||
nt|athene: only three trumps to lose off the top, but that's not the same as ten winners|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@D not that easy here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S I mean|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: true Bill|pg||
nt|irwinbo: if the heart 8 were the nine, prospects would improve immeasurably|pg||
nt|athene: i think he should run out of steam here|pg||
nt|mariner1: he might try a cross ruff here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: 2nt natural, 3@D = "i wasn't lying, i really DO have hearts"|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|henryb: you bet|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes I didn't think N would pass below game here|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: lost the play sorry|pg||
nt|mariner1: np ty Cricket :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: let's say the defence begin by running four diamonds and then play a heart|pg||
nt|athene: the blockages in both black suits are actually a bit troublesome for declarer - he can't take his 9 top tricks|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: In that case she should have opened 1NT|pg||
nt|athene: if he unblocks spades, he can't reach the @CKQ|pg||
nt|athene: and if he unblocks @CAJ first, he can't get back to the @SK|pg||
nt|athene: something has to be overtaken in a black suit and neither of them breaks kindlyt|pg||
nt|athene: robinson will probably cash the @DK and exit with a club, hoping that declarer doesn't have a club fit|pg||
nt|athene: hi welcome back everyone|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|benjent: Aren't Beale-Smart playing strong 1NT in 3rd?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Ah,|pg||
nt|henryb: but then I guess you can't when playing weak NT, which argues for opening 1NT|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: yes they are |pg||
pc|hK|nt|benjent: Big trouble in little China here. Dilks has found the right switch.|pg||
nt|mariner1: well pulling trumps might not be so good|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: time to claim|pg||
nt|athene: south's hand was surprisingly useful in 3nt actually :)|pg||

nt|mariner1: 4@H NS here|pg||
nt|athene: double now i suppose from north|pg||
nt|mariner1: when they bid that is :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|irwinbo: 4 spades down 3?|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose one of the (few) advantages of a 5-1 fit is that neither opp is short enough to double it|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: What is the E-W NT range?|pg||
nt|athene: but i'm really not a big fan of weak-2 openers on 5332 shapes|pg||

nt|athene: N-S can't really get into the auction|pg||
mb|3C|mb|4H|nt|mariner1: yes looks like EW stealing this one|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt a semi-psyche i guess; like responding 2nt to a weak-2 with a weak raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: their NT range is 20+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: INteresting|pg||
nt|mariner1: @SA and try to set up @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: or not :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: hope i got these alerts right|pg||
nt|mariner1: or yes :)|pg||
nt|athene: a diamond lead will kill the entry to the spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: this won't work at all well|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: declarer will just plod away at diamonds and make about eight tricks|pg||
nt|athene: south should surely hit 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: he has loads of defence|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes S should DBL to me|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mariner1: now he has a transportation issue here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mariner1: especially RED|pg||
pc|cA|nt|benjent: That's a Gallus favourite ... and Dilks played with Gallus fairly recently|pg||
nt|henryb: ROMEX or Little Roman?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I remember how 1NT was 17-20 in Roman Club|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@c looks likw asking and 3@h maximum with 4@h?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  like|pg||
nt|benjent: Another awkward lead problem for Diana|pg||
nt|pitiful:  Roland would lead J@h|pg||
nt|henryb: but in Little Roman (Pabis Ticci-D'Allellio) it was their strong opening|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, low heart ducked and a diamond back|pg||
nt|benjent: The @c lead didn't work last time, and it doesn't look like it's going to work this time either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I always defend perfectly (unless I don't)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@H is quite a call|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: magy said 'not max' but in reference to what bid i dont know|pg||
nt|mariner1: it works here|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: *nagy|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: you tend to take the money here because even if you suspect 4@SX is 500 against 650, going down in 5@H is a huge disaster|pg||
nt|irwinbo: 5h seems to be against the odds. getting 500 when you can make 620 is not awful, but going dwn at the five level is|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: at MP it's a harder decision|pg||
nt|mariner1: agreed Bill and Irwin....... little % in 5@H|pg||
nt|athene: because if everyone is making 620/650, then +500 is a zero anyway|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: he might make only seven if he just uses the @CA as entry to the diamonds and gives up on doing anything cute|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: if west had passed, then east opened 1@H and west perhaps uses Drury|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: and they play a heart partscore|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can run spades throwing a loser from each minor|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Serhat Ozenir|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|mariner1: well he still has A@C however K@S may be a problem|pg||
nt|athene: and which ever defender ruffs, it costs a trump trick|pg||
nt|serhat: hi all..|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|serhat: hi Bill|pg||
nt|athene: del'monte will be wondering whether to lead to the @CKQ and then return to @DA and lead again|pg||
nt|athene: but i think if west had nothing in clubs he would be much more likely to lead a club|pg||
nt|athene: so the @CA is very likely to be wrong anyway|pg||
pc|s2|nt|benjent: Hasn't quite made it yet ....|pg||
nt|athene: the defence have to lead something|pg||
nt|athene: which has the advantage of having more trumps than the defence|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS may have to give him K@S later|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: Burn's Law or Rules applies here -|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm  - Burn's Laws|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: he can try one club|pg||
nt|serhat: but he will try that|pg||
nt|athene: since he still has the @DA and a spade|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bjacobs: Getting closer|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|boltonian2: 800 is good against 6@Ss|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cuttysark: A save against a slam - but were they going to bid it?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|boltonian2: possibly not, only 4imps against the game|pg||
mb|4C|nt|boltonian2: and a little unluckly that the hands are so flat|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: East is looking at a 5-3-3-2 - never a good distribution for a save|pg||

nt|mariner1: well the dealer likes these misfit hands|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't think there was really much risk of going down if he led a fourth spade|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: interesting that Del'Monte doesn't make a weak jump overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 9 clubs for E-W, 9 hearts for N-S|pg||
nt|athene: Klinger will double now i guess|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: i think we have an initial pass in here|pg||
mb|3C|nt|benjent: A @c lead makes 3NT very difficult, and that is what was led in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D from north i could just about belive, but not 1@H from east |pg||
mb|3S|nt|benjent: You can still make 3NT, but you have to do some extreme things - play a @d to the 10 and the run the @h10|pg||
mb|5C|nt|athene: north might now be slightly worried about spades|pg||
nt|athene: so he might not just bash 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: but his singleton IS an honour|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@S here?|pg||
nt|athene: south's other problem is that his clubs are slow|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N could be beat NS if EW can untangle the @S suit|pg||
nt|athene: now 4@H|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: lilley wanted to double 1nt for 800 :)|pg||
nt|athene: so even if partner has enough in spades and diamonds, there might be only 8 tricks on a spade lead|pg||
nt|serhat: is that real?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: yep|pg||
nt|athene: well Qx is a good positional stopper|pg||
nt|athene: but only when your partner has the good taste to hold Axx|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: actually it might be OK facing xx, if someone leads 4th best from AK|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: this is indeed the case|pg||
nt|athene: @CAxx would be much nicer than @CKQJ for N-S|pg||
nt|athene: when you are contemplating 3nt based on a long suit, you need fast tricks outside|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: explaining alert but i cant read it sorry all|pg||
nt|athene: the problem for the defence is, they can't afford to let the @SQ score, but that means they have to give up their transportation|pg||
nt|irwinbo: is 2nt good bad?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H is interesting........ 2N maybe ingberman I am told|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see why 2nt should be necessary to show weakness after the 2@S bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://homepage.mac.com/bridgeguys/Conventions/IngbermanConvention.html|pg||
nt|athene: can't you just pass with rubbish?|pg||
nt|robinswr: hard to stay out of game vulnerable|pg||
pc|hA|nt|robinswr: even without the preempt|pg||
nt|mariner1: so off quicl|pg||
mc|7|nt|athene: a heart lead will kill 5minor fairly effectively|pg||
nt|athene: he might well end up losing a trump trick here as well as the four top tricks|pg||
nt|mariner1: quick|pg||
nt|athene: 5minor looks sounder but less exciting for the spectators|pg||

nt|athene: for example a lot of the time partner might have to go up with the @SK in third seat but he just won't|pg||

mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: The price you sometimes pat for playing weak NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, it has some advantages too|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south will win this and return small trump?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: it looks as though he just wants to play passively - for now, at least, anyway|pg||
nt|serhat: this wont make but hard to sea how to stop! probaly it is a flat board|pg||
nt|serhat: probably even! :)|pg||
nt|athene: if you return @S2 here you retain control and you can decide what to do later, having seen a discard from partner|pg||
nt|serhat: but that lets contract make with H finese|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but that takes a specific layout and an unlikely line of play|pg||
nt|athene: doing anything else looks riskier|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: well del'monte certainly is thinking about it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|irwinbo: diamond shift would give them eight tricks|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|athene: declarer didn't unblock diamonds in order to reach dummy for the spade finesse|pg||

nt|benjent: Lots of points but the wastage in clubs really skewers the slam|pg||
nt|benjent: Snap :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mariner1: 3N NS has a shot|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: NS have 4@S if they get there|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe too much to do to actually bring in 3N with a @D lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: that 200 might not be so bad|pg||
nt|athene: interesting diamond switch - looked as though it might find partner's @DQ|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: south has about a 3 1/2 @S bid now|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I bet it's a flat board, or even imps to Pennant|pg||
nt|patricck: would basically need a 3-3 @D break and the spade finesse, with QJ doubleton of @D an extra chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Although South has rebid well ...|pg||
nt|suzanna2: will F&D bid slam?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: After a strong 1NT opening, all North's would try a slam|pg||
nt|benjent: Well, in Acol, a simple raise shows an ok hand - 3 trumps with a shortage or around 15 balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|irwinbo: don't think it can be done|pg||
nt|athene: playing standard methods, it's pretty rare that 1@D is a 3-card suit|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: shall find out :)|pg||

nt|mariner1: so EW might score here|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: there's no rush to cash the diamonds, as the spades are blocked and no dummy entry|pg||
pc|d4|nt|benjent: I think Diana is bidding this very well ... looks like 3@c is a counter try|pg||
nt|patricck: North won't think that the 3@C bid is a bad thing|pg||

pc|h5|nt|athene: no - he can run a lot of clubs but the defence shouldn't have any problems|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mariner1: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|irwinbo: they got to 3nt on board 19 in the other romm well done|pg||
nt|irwinbo: room|pg||
nt|athene: although it's always easy to slip up in these situations|pg||
nt|serhat: thought dia -sp squeeze on..but there is a defence|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|benjent: Her best play is to draw trumps, cash the @dAK, cash the other @c, and exit a diamond hoping East is endplayed|pg||
nt|mariner1: small @D again|pg||
nt|athene: west had to jump in with @SK and clear @D surely|pg||
nt|athene: the key here is for north not to get stepping-stone endplayed|pg||
nt|athene: where west can cash the @SAJ and then put him on lead to give dummy the spades|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: but he really shouldn't be under too much pressure as declarer hasn't lost a trick yet |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|athene: with just a little more, either north or south would have bid 4@S|pg||
nt|serhat: now h|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|benjent: And that diamonds are 3-3, giving her a pitch for the other spade ... not tonight Josephine|pg||
nt|mariner1: I would have cashed 2 @H before ruffing @D|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: he knows the @CA is going to be an entry|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: he could have set up the clubs and used dummy's third trump to reach them but this was safer for 10|pg||
nt|athene: 11 sorry|pg||
nt|athene: he only loses @SAK|pg||
nt|mariner1: no reason to take extra chances in imps|pg||
nt|serhat: next c h again|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c7|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|serhat: and play small dia on fisrt dia|pg||
nt|serhat: abit hard|pg||
nt|athene: i saw a similar pseudo-squeeze to this one, succeed a couple of weeks ago in the australian seniors teams final|pg||
nt|serhat: if Rob jumps a hight diad the contract is making|pg||
nt|athene: now west can exit a diamond and if north goes in with an honour, he sets up a squeeze against himself|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d7|nt|athene: a pity, after finding the diamond lead|pg||

mb|1S|nt|mariner1: NS make 3N as Q@D drops|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in 1N?|pg||
nt|athene: did 5@C really make there?|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Good idea for Beale-Smart haven't done anything outrageously bad, but a few things have worked out poorly|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: interestin |pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H Muiderberg/Tartan 5@H and 4+ minor less than opening count|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S suggests that east thought 2@H was Ekrens (both majors)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure this is best spot |pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe somebody forgot something here?|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D will buy it i guess|pg||
nt|mariner1: N might try 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: the 1N in E should warn N though|pg||
mb|2H|nt|benjent: In the good old days, Beale-Smart played that X as penalty|pg||
nt|benjent: I believe they now relented and play it as negative|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, it caught opponents unawares.  In the old days it wasn't alertable.  One of them doubled 1@S for penalties, and next hand, oblivious raised to 2@S!|pg||
nt|sybarra: aha|pg||
nt|mariner1: aha 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder what north would have for a 2@S overcall?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: W might have thought about passing here......... could miss a game though|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: then it's a question of whether you can do anything cute to south in the black suits - there's a strip-squeeze i think actually|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: they claimed and accepted it|pg||
nt|serhat: I am guessing Rob played high dia|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: i may have the last trick a little off perhaps - very fast at the end then|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hmmmmm well defending 2@D is an easier way to make a living than declaring 3@D|pg||
mb|4H|nt|benjent: It was good just for the shock value|pg||
nt|mariner1: the asking call|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: in the old days it wasn't alertable? These days it isn't alertable down under either|pg||
nt|benjent: This is a going-down partscore hand ... looks right with those great suits to keep bidding for a while, but it all falls apart in the play|pg||
nt|patricck: no doubles, no matter what the meaning, are alertable|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 5@D has no play best defense|pg||
nt|athene: not sure i understand 5@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: why is that?   |pg||
nt|athene: are we sure it was east who bid that?|pg||
nt|mariner1: the 3@S bid really jammed the auction,,,,,,, do not understand it|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe 3@S was a control showing call|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry so I see,  "we" can not eat a ht |pg||
nt|athene: sorry  - i mean are we sure it wasn't east who bid 5@C?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: hi all sorry i havent had a chance to welcome everyone ... welcome everyone! lol ... .|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Cricket!|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Del'Monte having a think at the moment|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 nt?|pg||
nt|mariner1: N dist is so poor I am not sure I would bid 2@S either|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that looks more likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: 5@C making is correct though|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mariner1: in USA this would be a drug company vs fruits and vegetables :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|benjent: Just-in-time pass from Dilks. I reckon anything higher was getting cracked|pg||
nt|athene: it's hard to believe east would bid 5@C - presumably pass or correct for his partner's minor|pg||
nt|athene: but that's very, very high if partner has 5@H 4@D|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@C as Bill said mystifies me|pg||
nt|mariner1: why not happily pass 3N|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can lead to the @SK and set up a pitch for the @H2, but it's a question of reaching it|pg||
nt|mariner1: hence me thinking 1N would play this hand|pg||
pc|dK|nt|benjent: So looks like Butler are finally going to get on the board in the last set|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|patricck: I must admit I prefer Gold's 3@C opening in the other room. Sure I have two 3 card majors where we might belong as well, but they are 963 and J32 while my @C suit is magnificent|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mariner1: for that matter why not pass 2@S :)|pg||
nt|athene: a bit wet of north to sell out at the 2-level, perhaps - but i guess it depends what he is expecting for a weak-2 from Del'Monte here|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c7|pc|d6|nt|irwinbo: after the session n-s will amend their understandings|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: there would be a very nice line in 3@D if the defence cashed three hearts then exited a trump - you run the trumps coming down to @SAxx / @CA|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|athene: south has to keep @SKQx otherwise you can set up a spade|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 2@D meant as transfer|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: if only you could persuade west to duck one round of clubs you could run all the trumps and strip-squeeze him in @C+@H|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: then you strip his club with the @CA and lead a spade to the @S9, endplaying him|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: @C5 suit-preference for hearts|pg||
pc|s5|nt|serhat: he can make 8 tricks now|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|athene: but i can't see Lilley doing that|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess it's unlikely the defence would start with three hearts then a trump, as the cards are :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: the only way you gain big when you pass a board out low is if opps missed game|pg||
nt|athene: usually, anyway|pg||
nt|athene: so perhaps north ought to have competed a bit more|pg||
nt|athene: since he needs lots of imps (especially after 5@C)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|h9|nt|vugrapha4: think i mucked up one card about here sorry|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: that was the @SK?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: since it was unlikely E-W did have game on|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|serhat: this hand is ok.. cos 3d also dood|pg||
pc|c8|nt|serhat: good|pg||
pc|h7|pc|cK|nt|benjent: 3 imps back to Butler, and Pennant's lead is back to 11 ... but have a sneak preview of 27 in the closed room|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps del'monte thought that partner's 3NT had to show a long solid minor and so 5@C was p/c - but a) why shouldn't 3NT just be a balanced monster and b) even if 3nt was "source ...|pg||
nt|athene: of tricks", why not pass?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|pc|s7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: north hopes that east is down to @SAQ @Hx now|pg||
mc|9|nt|sybarra: oops|pg||
nt|athene: then you can force him to give you the @SK at the end|pg||
nt|athene: but that would mean 2@H was a 4-card suit, so he won't be hopeful|pg||

nt|athene: of course they may play a X of 3@C as t/o of hearts - it's a delicate issue at which point your doubles of artificial raises should become t/o of opps' anchor suit|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|athene: most experts play that if the raise can be weak (as here) then X is t/o|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H could be michaels type|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: normal technique to play diamonds first, surely - then if east wins and clears clubs, you can finesse spades safely|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|bjacobs: It's not as bad as it looks.  She KNEW South was void in spades, for example|pg||
nt|benjent: It's a curse I'm prepared to try one day :)|pg||
nt|athene: certainly west had to do SOMETHING|pg||
nt|mariner1: true|pg||
nt|athene: you can't just go around passing with that hand|pg||
nt|athene: good switch; just needed to be at trick 1 |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|athene: standard @SK falsecard from Del'Monte, but declarer isn't going to pay too much attention to it|pg||

nt|mariner1: another misfit hand|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: 2@C is both majors?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: W might get shoved too high|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: quite an opening bid, dont you think?|pg||
nt|mariner1: now that is a STRONG 1N|pg||
nt|mariner1: yep very weak, we think they are playing Moscito|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2H|nt|mariner1: tough play hand here for EW|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told 2@C is a multi, with one option being weak both majors|pg||
nt|mariner1: 20 - 20 hand|pg||
nt|serhat: Nice 3nt on thid board..|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Was it Napoleon who, when a general was being put forward to him said "yes yes, I know he's brilliant, but is he lucky?"|pg||
nt|mariner1: 10 - 10 - 10 - 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: think that is right  re system |pg||
nt|mariner1: N has to resist a @c lead|pg||
nt|athene: Klinger is fingering his 5@D card|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: yes william .. 2@C is what you said |pg||
nt|athene: plenty of hcp, no great weakness, no great fit...hard not to fall into 3nt|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mariner1: 11- 10 - 9 - 10|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D now gets passed out, maybe|pg||
nt|athene: although N-S have half the deck and a higher-ranking suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: W is very conservative here|pg||
nt|athene: but he does have no singletons and it's love-all|pg||
nt|athene: not favourable|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: klinger said to lilley that mullumphy has minors likely...|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: im guessing thats what his 2nt meant |pg||
nt|athene: my guess is east would double 5@D and beat it :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: a spec points out that north might consider cashing the @HA on opening lead as there's a danger he will get endplayed with it|pg||
nt|irwinbo: 500 at least|pg||
nt|athene: but he doesn't want to give up control|pg||
nt|mariner1: well play the Q@C and over|pg||
nt|athene: he wants to set up a club trick and use the @HA as entry to cash it|pg||
pc|sA|nt|benjent: When I'm in the middle of a lucky run, I don't care in the least how badly I played to do it, I stay in my seat|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: Mr Spock would not approve.  It is not logical.|pg||
nt|benjent: 4@s is makeable but (a) terrible and (b) pushy to bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You are evidently more of a Dr McCoy|pg||
nt|benjent: That's why James Tiberius Kirk was the captain :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh good says S as pard bids|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H is likely to be one down i guess so no real difference|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mariner1: off 2 likely|pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand is quite simply a "mess" |pg||
pc|d4|nt|mariner1: the deadly 200|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mariner1: small worked here as well|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: normally you go up with the @DQ from that suit and then try to lose the lead to east; but here, both critical fineses are into west (@H, @C) so there's less reason for that play|pg||
pc|sK|nt|benjent: Cash @sAK, and play hearts from the top, or the middle|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: declarer just wanted to get to hand conveniently|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c3|pg||

pc|hK|nt|vugrapha4: lost the play sorry|pg||
nt|athene: np|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: Del'Monte wants west to lead a heart but he isn't going to|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: is ok,  declarer seems to be wandering thru hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: np..... the players often hide their cards from the operators..... in the process of|pg||
nt|mariner1: breasting them as is a habit|pg||
nt|mariner1: and turning then quickly|pg||
nt|sybarra: and after doing that they play fast or claim (mumbling on the way) |pg||
nt|mariner1: them|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bjacobs: I think this was played better in the CR, where declarer played a club at trick 2|pg||
nt|mariner1: sure enough the deadly 200........|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: players are waiting for boards - shouldnt be long guys|pg||
nt|sybarra: np,  we do song and dance routines  |pg||
nt|mariner1: if you open light your system needs to have the controls in it to allow for|pg||
nt|mariner1: them......|pg||
nt|sybarra: Rob leads the dance group |pg||
nt|mariner1: wanna see a magic trick?|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably better than hearing me sing,  cant carry tune in bucket here|pg||
nt|mariner1: wanna see it again? :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL :)|pg||
nt|athene: on board 7, the auction started 3@H X but east raised to 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: and as expected, this just pushed N-S into the thin (but making) 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: if you are ever considering bidding 4@H in competition, you have to accept that it greatly increases the likelihood of opps bidding 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: so you have to decide if that's something you want|pg||
nt|sybarra: often you hear  "bidding 4 @H is a transfer (for opps) 4 @S|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nevertheless, it is the inferior play (IMO) that picks up the imps|pg||
nt|benjent: Yes, better play for 9 tricks. This was the better line for 10. Even playing @cK was dangerous - the bare cover would have guaranteed his contract|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: @D6 not quite big enough to get promoted|pg||

nt|josj: but if they don't use it...|pg||
nt|boltonian2: this was about long enough for E in the closed room|pg||
mb|4N|nt|josj: after 3@C the @CQJ gain in stature |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Wondering if he needs to prtoect the king of spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: well, she should but it does not matter this time|pg||
nt|josj: another chance for W to reevaluate his @C holding|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sorry, she is an Indonesian international lady player, I am told|pg||
nt|boltonian2: well, partner has given E two chances|pg||
nt|boltonian2: looks like a fairly powerful 15 count now, to me at least|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: hi again Cricket :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: In 7@C, declarer somehow had to find pitches for his 6 little hearts.  He couldn't manage it|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps just 2nt now|pg||
mb|2H|nt|benjent: The wheels had a serious dispute with the carriage in the closed room on this board|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@D was the bid that helped get EW off track, surely the hand is worth no more than 4@H?|pg||
nt|athene: the defence can take @HAK, @CK, @SA against 4@S here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mariner1: Cricket this says CLOSED ROOM now|pg||
nt|athene: not game-forcing with 12 and a stiff heart|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: lets try again  and pls Rob,  NO MORE magic tricks |pg||
nt|mariner1: that was quite a trip to Oz :)|pg||
mb|6N|nt|benjent: I wish I knew what East's 3@h-4@h sequence meant - it looks like he might be trying to sign off|pg||
nt|athene: many people would try the spade from north's hand but a diamond isn't a bad shot|pg||
nt|athene: they just have to be careful not to allow declarer to get a club away on the @HQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well N liked it|pg||
nt|athene: north keeps his @SQ92 to himself|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to take the @H hook, will he?|pg||
nt|irwinbo: odd lead|pg||
nt|athene: if you are trying to find partner's suit, a minor is often better than a major|pg||
nt|athene: here for instance|pg||
nt|athene: south might have had five diamonds|pg||
nt|mariner1: Closed Room also in 3N in 9|pg||
nt|athene: but much less likely to have five spades as he could overcall 1@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: I'm not a fan of East's 4@c bid in the CR either. Even though it theoretically can work out to find the secondary fit, in practice I think with 7-4s you're better off focussing on ...|pg||
nt|benjent: the 7 card suit|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Technically the par result, although usually, 4@S will go down a trick|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Declarer must have finessed the spade in the CR?|pg||

nt|athene: Del'Monte is never defending 4@S when his partner doesn't double it|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: seems off 1|pg||
nt|irwinbo: a bit much|pg||

nt|sybarra: and no wasted values in @D  (okay maybe 1) |pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: so this is the antepenultimate board :)|pg||
nt|athene: after opps open a Multi and partner bids a major, is the other major a cue?|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok  we can to that  (bd. 1 and 3) |pg||
nt|athene: it's not 100% certain which is their suit|pg||
nt|athene: one down looks reasonable here|pg||
nt|athene: west might have to switch to a diamond i guess|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise three diamonds go on the clubs|pg||
nt|athene: thanks to the very friendly club position|pg||
nt|irwinbo: west must have not shifted to a diamond at trick 3|pg||
nt|athene: very difficult for west - it's rare you have to attack dummy's side-suit|pg||
nt|athene: only when declarer has a concealed source of tricks, as here|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|athene: yes i think the wise money will be on Lilley at this point :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: *bd 1 and 2 |pg||
