nt|vugraphzpt: We Pepsi and Lev on BBO for this session|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|vugraphzpt: Will this wild  pre-empt keep them out of thhe granny not that it is such a good contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|vugraphzpt: Making 3-5-3-3 but may go down on restricted choice of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: But if he finds out North has a singleton spade then he will liekly read the situation|pg||
nt|lc: Many experts play that after a 3NT overcall that 4@C asks.  This pair may not have discussed it.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpt: I am guessing Wigoder wont double 5@D for the lead|pg||
nt|lc: The responses to 4@C:  4@D/4@H=minimums,  4@H/4@S = maximum|pg||
nt|lc: The first step in each case is a "1-suited" type of hand, the 2nd choice is balanced.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: In 7@H will likely fail as restriicted choice in 7NT will likely make as will be able to explore the hand|pg||
nt|lc: So, maybe 4NT = balanced, extras -- although I don't think 17 is extras.|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpt: Lev in Tank|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: So we have Pepsi and Lev in this room for the entire session|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Will update you on opps shortly|pg||
nt|lc: I think 7NT is 100% to make.  South will show up with 3@C, 6@S, 2@D -- so can't have 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Thinking hand on forehead|pg||
mb|7N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpt: We dont miss aces says Pepsi|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|lc: The only danger, I suppose, is a 1st round @H finesse.|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lc: Now, he can't go wrong.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lc: Zia will show up with 11 cards outside of @H, so can't have @HJxx.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|lc: And, as David said, players in 7@H won't have this luxury, and are likely to go down.|pg||

mc|13|nt|lc: Nicely done by Pepsi -- but you would expect that at this level.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Counted the hand and immediately said King|pg||
nt|lc: The day is off to quite a start!|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: quiet or quiet|pg||
nt|lc: Hi Bob|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Pepsi shaking his finger at Wigoder about the quality of his pre-empt|pg||

nt|lc: Played rather quickly for what might have been a tricky hand on some other layout.|pg||
nt|bobh1: ok now back to the 1n psyche|pg||
nt|lc: I'll predcit a psychic 1NT by Pepsi.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|lc: Much sexier -- 1NT!|pg||
nt|lc: A Zia-like psyche against Zia.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: no imagination|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: wigoder smiles wryly at Pepsi|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzpt: All results here http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=39&Itemid=50|pg||
nt|lc: Unclear what Zia should do, but I would bid only 3@S, I think.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Partner can balance quite light.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Wrong|pg||
nt|lc: Well, I didn't say ZIA WOULD BID 3@S.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|lc: In fact, I'd expect Zia to do anything but. :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: You mean anything and everything|pg||
nt|bobh1: maybe he's expecting a frivolous preempt at the colors and seat|pg||
nt|lc: I like to play "down the middle," but as I think more, I kind of like Zia's choice.|pg||
nt|bobh1: me too with two bullets|pg||
nt|bobh1: especially at imp pairs where you need some spectacular results|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: On the assumption - unreasonable or not - that Levin Weinstein have this event at their mercy Pepsi and Lev are certainlyy in the hujnt for some money between 2nd and 10th|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|lc: The choices were:  Pass, 3@S, 4@S, and 3NT, I suppose.  But the latter 2 would probably get the most votes.|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe I will submit it to Bridge World MSC panel.|pg||
nt|lc: latter 2 the LEAST votes, I meant.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I would not venture 3NT else you will stop partner  balancing in the future|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|mc|8|nt|lc: Some would say that passing stops him from balancing next time :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Zia shows his twwo aces and the clubs|pg||
nt|bobh1: but since you are considering a game 3@s might be a wimp out|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Back soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Zia says goodbye|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: to you the audience - he says he doesnt think he will be seeing them again today|pg||
nt|lc: Tell Zia I am ready to take him on at "even"  (golf)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Taking a breif break while available|pg||
nt|lc: Since the table is opened and there are people here, I am happy to chat :)|pg||
nt|lc: Let's see what the topic will be...|pg||
nt|lc: How about Levin-Weinstein??|pg||
nt|lc: It is unbelievable how they do (and are doing) in this event.|pg||
nt|lc: They are cruising to their 4th win -- unprecedented (and the 6th for Weinstein).|pg||
nt|lc: In case anyone didn't know, this is a TOUGH event.|pg||
nt|lc: Most of the world's best players are there.|pg||
nt|lc: It is gruelling -- many boards, not much time to rest.|pg||
nt|lc: There is lots of luck.|pg||
nt|lc: You can get buried alive (I know from personal experience).|pg||
nt|lc: So, for them to be +200 "Real" Imps after 4 sessions is remarkable!!!!!!|pg||
nt|bobh1: i like this format because it rewards a very aggressive style|pg||
nt|lc: They are averaging having a +50 set against the world's best players every 27 boards or so.|pg||
nt|bobh1: i agree though that results can sometimes be random|pg||
nt|bobh1: however they are not random for levin-weinstein apparently|pg||
nt|lc: There is still suspense this session...|pg||
nt|lc: Even though it is 99% Levin-Weinstein will win, there is a ton of money at stake for 2nd, 3rd, etc.|pg||
nt|lc: Many people have money bet on the pairs in contention...lots of ineterest, still.|pg||
nt|mittmouse: hi guys|pg||
nt|bobh1: i've watched levin-weinstein quite a bit|pg||
nt|lc: Hi George.|pg||
nt|lc: We're chatting "Larry style."|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi george|pg||
nt|lc: I monopolize and nobody else can talk. :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: they've bid very aggressively and people have stayed out of the thin games against them|pg||
nt|mittmouse: a good plan|pg||
nt|lc: When I bid agressively, everything is 4-1.|pg||
nt|mittmouse: do u miss not playing larry|pg||
nt|lc: Not one bit.|pg||
nt|lc: I hear from the players that this event was too gruelling -- no time to breath.|pg||
nt|lc: Bridge is supposed to be fun. Not torture.  Right?|pg||
nt|bobh1: this event seems like a lot of fun to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Can report Helness and Helgemo failed in 7@H|pg||
nt|lc: Sure, in 7@H, no way to test the distribution.|pg||
nt|lc: So, normal restricted choice.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: This year with the two extra rounds it has been gruelling for the BBO operators - Oh sorry you were discussing the players|pg||
nt|lc: :)|pg||
nt|lc: But, that deal is a perfect example of what I didn't like about this event. Zia sat down and will lose 300 crossimps just for his opps reaching 7NT.|pg||
nt|bobh1: they also take long breaks between rounds which drags things out|pg||
nt|lc: No control and 300 cross-imps (like losing 12 to every pair) are gone.|pg||
nt|lc: If you click MOVIE -- and Bd. 1 you will see what happened.|pg||
nt|lc: If you came late, Pepsi, in 7NT had a complete count and claimed 1520.|pg||
nt|lc: The "restricted choice" became moot. South showed up with 11 cards outside of @H.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: OK Opps for Lev and Pepsi will be in order Gitelman Moss - Hussein Sadek - DeKnijff Wrang - cheek Grue - Blanchard x 2 - Bathurst Lall - Deutsch Kranyak - Feldman Zagoran|pg||
nt|lc: GitMo (that's Gitelman-Moss) and Cheek-Grue are in 2n/d and 3rd palce.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Closing and reopening|pg||

nt|lc: Hey!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: They took the boards out of order|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|vugraphzpt: The organisers would hate to have Board 3 up on BBO ahead of the field|pg||
