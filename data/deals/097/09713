mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: They did well in the Vanderbilt, I think, winning it.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|brolucius: 1@H better than 1@S when you are opening four-card majors, because you have the chance to find a fit in either suit.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|nt|brolucius: Some pairs play that 2NT shows a strong four-card raise and a cue-bid (2@S) would show strong three-card support.|pg||
nt|po-s: that is a theory that Bob Hamman doesn´t agree with|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|po-s: the 4-4 business, but I of course agree with you|pg||
pc|s7|nt|brolucius: He is better at playing in a 4-3 fit than me.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|dburn: then you had better ask your partner to stop raising with three-card support|pg||

nt|brolucius: I shouldn't have mentioned ever raising on three-card support. It has made David Burn log off. My fault.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|po-s: or 2NT minors - if allowed|pg||
mb|2D|mb|3H|nt|brolucius: 2@D is a surprise, for me. Dangerous with a void spade.|pg||

nt|po-s: looks like he was escaping....|pg||
nt|brolucius: North may guess the diamonds. |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|brolucius: It seems that North and South were thinking on different lines as to the 2@D bid. Some would say that there must be spade support when South is a passed hand. |pg||
pc|hT|nt|brolucius: Anyway, 3@S may have been enough on the North cards.|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|brolucius: When you have a void in partner's suit, best to retreat inside your shell.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Now East has tough decision, whether to bid again. Ah, he has done.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|brolucius: The trumps are ropey and someone should allow for that. But the cards lie well.|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|po-s: now East must bid slam'|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: We will be back in some minutes after this board with Rd5|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer may need to take the heart finesse, even though he could discard a heart on a spade.|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Well, this will be a lucky one, assuming they make it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: We have an expression for a poor quality slam - Norwegian slam|pg||
nt|po-s: one that makes |pg||
nt|brolucius: I can guess what you call an excellent slam.|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: I cant leave the table open, hands must be reloaded after each Rd, sorry|pg||

nt|brolucius: ... is the site for the auction results.|pg||
nt|po-s: no,no. They were wellknown for slams making after three finesses, 3-2 in trumps and a squeeze in the end|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even the great Helgemo may spend a while planning this one.|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: 2 minutes left for this round, we r in the extra time already|pg||
nt|po-s: well, in those slams there aren´t many choices|pg||
nt|brolucius: Being such a simple soul, I would finessein hearts and hope for the best in diamonds, leading towards the K-Q.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Finesses against a king are around 60% when you are as good as Helgemo.|pg||
nt|po-s: I guess you might ruff two clubs while playing trumps, then throw a heart on the 3rd spade|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|h5|mc|12|nt|brolucius: Bob Mahaffey, who invested a large sum in Helgemo-Helness will be nodding his head approvingly.|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: will reopen soon|pg||
nt|po-s: I didn´t say he would make it the club ruff way, but it might make with another distribution of NS hands with the HK off side|pg||
