mb|2N!|an|!h & !d|nt|lc: for the reds, no doubt.|pg||
nt|petergill: Levin - Weinstein won the Vanderbilt recently too. |pg||
nt|lc: That's what I would have bid with East's hand.|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT = red suits|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|lc: Now, not likely to reach @S.|pg||
nt|lc: Tough for N-S now.|pg||
mb|d|nt|lc: What (if anything) should North or South do?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: So, North doubles, ostendisbly for takeout.|pg||
nt|petergill: Tricky bid for Tudor now|pg||
nt|lc: Will South takeout to 4@S?|pg||
nt|reisig: If I had a bet ...I bet the King bids it|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D perhaps, in case North has only 3 spades?|pg||
nt|lc: I don't think he has enough @D to consider defending (in spite of his amazing @H).|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Tudor asking systems|pg||
nt|petergill: understandably|pg||
nt|lc: Pass would certainly be the winner -- on a trump lead, 800 I think.|pg||
nt|lc: E-W have only 5@D and the @SA in 3@D X.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: What a winning decision. Wow!  |pg||
nt|lc: This screams for a trump lead by Glubok -- but maybe the @CA first.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lc: Glubok knows that Tudor is loaded in @H .  So good lead.|pg||
nt|petergill: Tudor is a two time winner of the event, and a winner on this hand, if the defence is optimal|pg||
nt|petergill: Good lead|pg||
nt|lc: Yes, Tudor can cross in @C (after appropriate signal) to get trumps clears.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|lc: Dec will win, play @HJ, but won't get a signal, I suppose.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|lc: So, Tudor has to guess which black suit to cross in to get trumps cleared.|pg||
nt|petergill: South worked out that partner would have bid 3@S with good shape, and since partner couldn't have much in hearts, partner must have a few @D's. Logic. |pg||
nt|lc: If he tries a @S, declarer will save a trick (getting to ruff a @H in hand).|pg||
nt|petergill: @D5 as a suit preference lead might have helped, instead of @D6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|lc: So, a @C will be 800, a @S 500.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|d4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|lc: So, would 4@S have made?  Even if so, I think +500 will be a pretty good result for N-S (as there won't be tons of 620's).|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petergill: Very unusual to pass a take-out Dbl with a singleton trump, but it makes sense when you think about the sort of hand partner would have to Dbl. |pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lc: Do any of you think Tudor could have figured out to cross in @C instead of @S?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|lc: Didn't he take 6@D and the @SA?|pg||
nt|petergill: @D2 overruffed by @D5!!!|pg||
mb|d|nt|lc: Oops, He ruffed the @H LOW in hand.  Ouch.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|vugraphzps: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: 800 is correct|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose he was hoping to ruff the first @H low, then the second one high.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: He intended to ruff another spade then ruff the next heart high|pg||
nt|petergill: Understandable|pg||
nt|lc: Sure.  Although that would mean North was 2=3 in the reds -- not likely.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|lc: But, it could happen to all of us.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Bold raise by Glubok.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|petergill: 3NT looks fairly easy - a @D lead is best|pg||
nt|lc: Cards very friendly for N-S.|pg||
nt|lc: Both black suits sitting pretty.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lc: I think many will play in 1NT -- same auction and North doesn't raise.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petergill: Yes, he didn't deduce that South's non-@D continuation meant that South had no more @D's for the unusual Pass of the Dbl. |pg||
nt|lc: In fact, I can say for sure that Cohen-Cohen would have reached 1NT.|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe that's why Cohen-Cohen is sitting at home instead of in Vegas.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|petergill: Axx in RHO's five card suit is not a great holding for a 1NT overcall, hence Glubok's Dbl. |pg||
nt|lc: Great start to this round for Glubok-Tudor.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|po-s: But against Cohen x 2 kards would sit differently|pg||
pc|h5|nt|po-s: cards|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: but many Norths will overcall 1NT anyway, I think|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lc: I dislike 1NT -- agree with X for the reasons you gave.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|lc: I can state with 100% certainty that if Berkowitz is North he will X -- not 1NT.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|lc: He is big on right-siding contracts.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|lc: Tip for newer viewers: Click the Cog wheel at the bottom -- on tool bar...|pg||
nt|lc: You can then click the box "SHOW PLAYED CARDS" --|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|lc: Or unclick it.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lc: That way, you can see all the cards as they are played (or not).|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|d2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|petergill: On http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/webcam/1/table1.jpg, it's Michel Bessis and Brian Glubok now. |pg||
nt|lc: And, a more familiar tip - you can click the @SA/@SA button to change the view.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|dT|nt|lc: Glubok has looked like that for the past 30 years. Never changes.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s4|nt|petergill: His hair was a bit longer for a while. |pg||

pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||

nt|lc: So, 1@D for South -- too good to preempt, I 'd think.|pg||
nt|lc: Then maybe 1@S by West -- also too good to preempt?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lc: Nothing would surprise me, though.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lc: See.|pg||
nt|petergill: Voila|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Most roads lead to 4@S by E-W anyway.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|petergill: 6-4 bid more|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Not a bad slam, though.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Although slam is good, it is likely to fail -- dec won't guess @C.|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, very few will reach 6@S.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|lc: Another trump lead by Glubok, but this one won't produce 800.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lc: Dec will be happy to see the @C don't come in now.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|petergill: I would have led @DQ, but perhaps I am too simple?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d2|pc|s4|pc|cT|pg||
nt|lc: He can set them up, but to make only 11 tricks.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|dQ|pc|s9|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|dT|pc|s7|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d7|nt|petergill: Perhaps North reasoned: I have 8 points , so they have only about half the points and are at 4 level, so I should cut down ruffs. |pg||
nt|lc: So, 15 down. 12 to go this session.|pg||
pc|d4|mc|11|nt|lc: Sure, Iike the trump lead.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Ok people ill be back very soon with rd 25 ill close the table now brb|pg||
