nt|brolucius: We have the players, the cards, all we need is .... action!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|2C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|rain: Hedy sent the link to NS CC for those curious: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2007BermudaBowlShanghai/bermuda-bowl/Norway/helgemo-helness.pdf|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: A double does not normally promise both majors on this sequence. You may have only one.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|brolucius: But Helgemo's 4@H suggests that North has both. Unusual, because he could hardly bid 2@S when 4-3 in the majors.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, a passed hand will often have both, but certainly there are no guarantees - unless by agreement|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Didn't West have some Sacred Music named after him?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: Yes, some chants.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The Krekorian Chant|pg||

nt|chessmaste: West would like to get East in - but he can't|pg||

nt|dburn: I think that may be Krikorian, but I confess that my Armenian is not what it might be|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has the option of leading a low trump from hand, playing West for a doubleton trump honour.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He would then need to reach dummy only once with a diamond ruff.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Can that be the right play?|pg||
nt|brolucius: The right play is obviously not clear, or Helgemo would have swung into action by now.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|dburn: that looks to be the right play, but unluckily it won't work|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now he must guess whether East has both honours or West has a bare honour. |pg||

nt|dburn: I confess, I can't see any reason why declarer should get this right|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|chessmaste: True enough but you would expect a few to make it, perhaps on different defence|pg||
mb|d|mb|1D|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: I am not a fan of the double with a balanced hand, but it worked for the Italians for years|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@S suggests around 8-10 points (non forcing). Of course South is entitled to add a bit for the extra spades. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|brolucius: At a tournament in England last weekend (Spring Fours final) Forrester responded only 1@S to a double of 1@D when holding 4-1-4-4 shape and 9 points. I could not believe it.|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|brolucius: 2@H seems absolutely obvious to me, but I have seen players bid 3@H on such hands (maybe a tad stronger) and say learnedly "It was such a pure hand." |pg||

mc|10|nt|brolucius: Kibitzers tell me that you should rebid 3@H with six losers, but responder does not guarantee only nine losers when he responds at the one-level.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The benchmark for responses has fallen - as have those for an opening bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: You have to allow something for the point-count, as well as the loser-count. With only 12 points, it is likely that partner will bid again when there is a good play for game.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Helgemo is a dashing bidder in general. If he thinks it is worth only 2@H, who are we to query the decision?|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Each round we will be closing the table and reopening with the new round|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: now we just have to wait until everyone else is done playing|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can't do everything just by losers. It makes a difference if South has AK of diamonds, AQ or KQ, which are all the same loser-count.  |pg||
nt|brolucius: Can someone speak knowledgably about (a) the Cavendish web-site and (b) the auction results?|pg||
