mb|r|an|Alerted|nt|lc: Nice of you guys to start me off with my regular partner, Dave Berkowitz, sitting East.|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: always our plan to be niceto the VG Comms|pg||
nt|lc: He could have opened a strong 1@C with East's hand.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lc: Borderline, in my opintion.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzps: Being nice to COmms is borderline??|pg||
nt|lc: The XX is supposed to be 10+ HCP and exactly 2@H|pg||
nt|lc: I suspect Pollack forgot.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lc: They are playing 100% the Berkowitz-Cohen system card.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Very good job to reach 3NT instead of 4@H|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose most roads lead to 3NT.|pg||
nt|lc: As long as East rebids something like 3@H, West will bid 3NT.|pg||
nt|lc: Nothing about East hand indicates a reason to play in 4@H|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lc: So, I expect at least 90% of the field to reach 3NT.|pg||
nt|lc: If you are wondering why Berkowitz passed on Round 2...:|pg||
nt|lc: That is because when partner redoubles, and immediate bid by opener shows WEAKNESS.|pg||
nt|lc: With a good hand, opener passes and bids later.|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pc|c2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lc: Since the form of scoring is IMPs, there is no real interest here in the play -- with 9 top tricks.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c3|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|cT|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lc: The players are being tortured today (and yesterday).  |pg||
pc|d5|pc|c6|nt|lc: What I mean by that is :|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lc: They have to play 27 boards in the afternoon,|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|nt|lc: Then 30 boards at night.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lc: With screens, this takes many hours -- almost 10.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lc: It leaves little time for sleeping, eating, talking about the hands, etc.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzps: 10 1/2|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|lc: I really don't understand why they play so many boards -- nobody I know likes this policy.|pg||
mc|9|nt|lc: Part of the fun of a bridge tournament has to be to have a little "down time" -- especially to talk about the boards.|pg||
nt|lc: They will have only a 30-minute break between sessions today!|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Thomas wishing he had the @CJ to lead|pg||
nt|lc: Well, evem if he had @CJxx, I doubt he would have led the @CJ :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: It worked out at 45 yesterday so maybe they will move things along to get 1 hour|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lc: Will North invite?|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: It did look feeding at the zoo at the fast food outlets yesterday|pg||
nt|lc: I think it is pretty hungry to invite with 4-3-3-3 8-count.  |pg||
nt|lc: Only good feature is the QJ10 in clubs, of course.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|lc: Still, the lure of a VUL game at imps might attract a few invites.|pg||
nt|lc: As here.|pg||
nt|lc: South will reject, though.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Assuming 15-17.|pg||
nt|lc: Lead in either major now will cost a trick.|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Major suit leads all bad|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: For defence|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|lc: So, the key to beating this, I think is for East to win @DA and find @S switch.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lc: Not easy unless looking at all 4 hands.|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lc: Declarer will cross in @C and play a @D.|pg||
nt|lc: Will Berk get it right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Thomas went to close the door and Michel played the @C10 much laughter|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|lc: He is pretty good at making 2nd-hand high plays when needed -- I have seen him get these right many times.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lc: He got that part right...|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
nt|lc: But, couldn't work out to play a @S|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzps: Will make 8|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|lc: The @S switch was right only if declarer had @SKx (with the "x" not the 9).|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s8|pc|c5|pc|s6|pg||
mc|8|nt|lc: Probably a small gain for N-S.|pg||
pg||

nt|lc: Each round is 3 deals.  9 rounds in this session. This is Round 1.|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: welcome to Peter Gill from Australia|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi everyone|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lc: Hi Peter -- what hour is it in Australia?|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: 03:40|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lc: Should South open 1@C or 1@D?  Assuming no system constraints, this question has no universal answer.|pg||
nt|dburn:  fairly early in the morning or fairly late at night, depending on your point of view|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: On Bd 2, perhaps Pollack's club pip at Trick 2 (@C2 didn't seem to helpmight have been a clue for Berkowitc to switch to @s, if playing Smith Echos or the like. |pg||
nt|lc: Possible for E-W to overreach to 4@S here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzps: Pollack doesnt like pushing out the boat too far here|pg||
nt|lc: Pollack didn't raise?  Seems odd.|pg||
nt|dburn:  or underreach to 1@s, as it were|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Had he raised, though, Berk may have bid game.|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: No strain this early in the AM|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lc: If Berk were 2-1 the other way, it wouldn't be pleasant to rest in 1@S.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzps: Berkowitz laughing att dummy|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lc: I call it "cackling."|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|dburn:  the defence to 4@s won't be completely obvious, though|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|dburn:  so it might make at a table or two|pg||
nt|petergill: North's high-low in @d might lead South to try a 3rd @D. |pg||
nt|vugraphzps: No more of a bemused laugh than a cackle|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|lc: I think with that dummy, South will try to grab 4 minor-suit tricks against 4.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c4|mc|9|nt|vugraphzps: OK I'll hand you back to Cata now that I have fixed the mouse for herto use|pg||
nt|lc: But, South will always cash @CA first against game.  If discouraging card, then he can try for @D overruff.|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: www.cavendishinvitational.com|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks David|pg||
nt|lc: I suspect a small gain to E-W for stopping in a partscore.|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: I will see you all this afternoon|pg||
nt|lc: I've asked David to introduce Dad & Son -- N-S  -- he is "closer" to them.|pg||
nt|lc: Meanwhile, I can certainly tell you about E-W.|pg||
nt|lc: Having a bridge partner for 20 years is probably worse than a marriage.|pg||
nt|dburn:  I am not sure, but I would guess that the Bessis family has the record for the greatest number of champion players|pg||
nt|dburn:  Michel (father), Thomas (son) and Veronique Bessis have many national and international titles among them|pg||
nt|lc: David Berkowitz and his wife, Lisa also have many titles.|pg||
nt|lc: And West's partner, Rozanne Pollack has also won many titles.|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Next pair coming Brogeland Svendsen|pg||
nt|lc: Billy Pollack has played the last 3-4 years with Berk in this event -- ever since I stopped  (I don't like it).|pg||
nt|lc: It is a great event.  Just not for me.  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: closing and reopening|pg||
