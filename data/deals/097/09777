mb|p|mb|1D|nt|vugraphzpt: But intuition based on amazing abilities|pg||
nt|lc: if time permits, I'll tell you about N-S later.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lc: Neg X or 2@C?|pg||
nt|mittmouse: its interesting that the 3 pairs who went for the most money are all in the top 5|pg||
mb|d!|an|4 or 5 spades|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|bobh1: i prefer 2@c with a GF hand|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|vugraphzpt: Interesting that the favourites are all doing well.....hmmmm.....|pg||
nt|lc: When X=4 or 5 @S (a modern treatment), opener's 1@S usually is only 3 cards (he bids 2@S with 4 cards--not promising extras).|pg||
nt|bobh1: now they will play in @ss which may be ok|pg||
nt|mittmouse: the brazilians play 3c in this position shows a game force with 5c and 4s|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: 4NT is pretty good spot here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: 3NT|pg||
nt|lc: Certainly 3NT is easier.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I like aa challenge L)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpt: Pepsi trying to do some splaining but it involves lots of shoulder shrugging|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: In "Standard" after 1@D (1@H), X=4@S and 1@S=5+@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: i guess 2@s by lev shows weakness; some might think it confirms @ss|pg||
nt|lc: Many experts play that X=4 or 5@S and 1@S denies @S.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I think he believes partner has 4 spades|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|mittmouse: 3nt would have been boring at least this is exciting|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|bobh1: well pepsi wasn't inspired in the bidding but he may dazzle us in the play|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: South should play @HJ on trick 1 I think|pg||
nt|lc: A secy lead -- but Sadek suspected Lev would have bid NT with the @HK.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c2|nt|bobh1: this trick will slow the play down|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|lc: I can hear Lev screaming now : "Why you no beed zee notrump???"|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h3|pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Problem south ruffed which would have stuffed me up right royally|pg||
nt|lc: So, if he plays good @C, what can South do?|pg||
nt|lc: david, can you translate that last thought of yours to English?|pg||
nt|bobh1: seems the defense has rwo trumps and a @d coming only|pg||
nt|lc: It sounds obscene, what you wrote:)|pg||
nt|bobh1: oh and a @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: North did ask south if he has no club and director now at the table|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s6|nt|lc: In U.S. events, declarers can ask their defenders "No clubs, partner?"|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lc: I think that shouldn't be allowed.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: In Aus and US only I think elsewhere NOT allowed|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, I think Lev is on the right path here.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lc: It is silly. "NO CLUBS PARTNER???"  Your surprise gives away info.|pg||
nt|lc: So, easy now.|pg||
mc|10|nt|lc: What if Hussein had played more @H...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Apparently also in UK|pg||
nt|lc: Oh well -- have to go to Bd. 8 -- |pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: That is the exact enquiry his partner is making of him|pg||
nt|mittmouse: no mps|pg||
nt|lc: Dummy is allowed to check for declarer revoke -- I don't mind that.  But on defense?  Surely it is silly.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Very honest of Sadek to point out to the director that he had made this enquiry - nobody else had commented on it|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|nt|lc: "Does 3@D show or deny a stopper?" -- The most asked question of bridge teachers....|pg||
nt|lc: The answer:|pg||
nt|bobh1: and Kx in the suit they bid|pg||
nt|lc: NO -- it is ambiguous -- might have stopper, might not.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|lc: I have an article coming out soon on "Western Cues" and such bids as 3@D -- will be on www.larryco.com|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: If you are asked what it means, just say "forcing."|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: If you look at the webcam pix half way down the page at http://www.cavendishinvitational.com Lev on the left and Sadek on the right|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lc: So, again 3NT might have been easier.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzpt: Thanks you says Lev|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mittmouse: good lead he knows the k of d is likely in dummy because opener didnt bid 3nt|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@h no prob on this layout of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Next are DeKnijff/Wrang|pg||
nt|lc: Yes, same as last hand -- he knows the king is not with Lev -- no notrump bid.|pg||
nt|lc: At least, that is the logic I would use. Then I lead the Ace and dec turns up with the king.|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|nt|bobh1: well pepsi is consistent in how he handles this hand-type . . . wonder why he does it that way?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose he thinks it simplest to try to immediately locate the major-suit fit.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|dQ|nt|mittmouse: actually holding declarer to 4 is probably worth 46 imps nothing to sneeze at|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s2|nt|lc: With a GF, I prefer to bid in actual order (the 5 card suit first).|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bobh1: yes maybe especially when the main alternative is 3n (i.e., you have Kx in righty's suit)|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
mc|10|nt|bobh1: i think 46 imps is actually something to sneeze at in this format|pg||
pg||

nt|bobh1: but please cover your mouth before you sneeze|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lc: When George (mittmouse) says "46 IMPs" -- that is really like "2"  (x 23 other tables)|pg||
mb|d|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|lc: Ahh -- My faith in Egyptian bidding is restored :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: or you might get arrested|pg||
nt|lc: Have the values for a XX depreciated?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lc: Ii thought it was 10+?|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe only 8+ needed if you are Egyptian.|pg||
nt|lc: Incidentally, Sadek lives in Cairo, Hussein in the U.S. (but from Egypt).|pg||
nt|poohbear: looks like rdbl was accidental|pg||
nt|poohbear: was 1S |pg||
nt|poohbear: then 2H|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hi LC|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|lc: Hi Barry|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|nt|poohbear: everyone|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi barry|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzpt: Unlike your faijth in BBO operatotrs|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|lc: :)|pg||
nt|mittmouse: hey barry|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lc: BBO operating is an underpaid and underappreciated job.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lc: Although, so is BBO commentating.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|bobh1: and very hard also|pg||
mc|8|nt|lc: They only complain whem you screw up (which is so easy to do).|pg||
nt|bobh1: operating not commentating|pg||
nt|lc: It is hard to type and think at the same time. |pg||
nt|poohbear: I used to say that if you scored 1 imp a board ( 23 in this format) in this event you would win going away. Not this year!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Closing and reopening|pg||
nt|lc: Right - Levin-Weinstein are averaging almost 2 imps a board.|pg||
nt|bobh1: i've seen enough poor vuegraph operators to appreciate the good ones|pg||
nt|poohbear: so 46 is nothing nto sneeze at|pg||
nt|bobh1: very hard to follow the play especially|pg||
nt|lc: I think "46" is an overbid on that board -- as likely 430 at most tables.|pg||
nt|mittmouse: y|pg||
nt|bobh1: surely theyare averaging more than 2 cross-imps per board|pg||
