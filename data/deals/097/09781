mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|lc: But, the boards are up -- so later if time.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|poohbear: www.cavendishinvitational.com for info about the auction and standings|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lc: 2@S = limit+ in @C, no doubt.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lc: Normally would have a 5th club, but no other bid fits -- other than maybe 2@D for South.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpt: You;ll always be north says I yes says Pepsi and then.....|pg||
nt|lc: THe goal on these hands is to reach 3NT -- very routine here.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|lc: Another where the entire room should be in 3NT (there were a few earlier).|pg||
nt|bobh1: 2n if passable seems out of character for lev|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lc: Maybe he downgraded his @S holding.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: s|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bobh1: but all those T's, red at imps how would you feel if partner passed?|pg||
nt|lc: So, with the @C coming in, 9 top tricks.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d6|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lc: Another deal that would be of more interest at a different form of scoring.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|lc: But, as Barry said, this makes it go faster.  Nobody sweats out the overtricks.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobh1: maybe he knows pepsi never passes|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|hT|pg||
mc|10|nt|lc: Yes, maybe Lev could have bid 3NT himself.|pg||

nt|lc: Wukk Grue try?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Swap Grue's minors and game may be a prospect|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Tried, but no interest from Cheek.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|poohbear: Grue and Cheek playing precision so why no immediate 3H bid larry?|pg||
nt|lc: This may come down to the @H guess.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|lc: Usually 3@H means 5-5 but all the cards in the majors -- pure.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lc: Side King not acceptable.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|bobh1: grue is a good guesser|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|lc: I doubt he is this good.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: He would need to be behind my shoulder to pick this  one|pg||
nt|bobh1: yeah surprised he started @hs from his hand|pg||
nt|lc: Trying to figure out what Pepsi is thinking about.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|lc: Is there any reason/way for Grue to guess this?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Diamond finesse is of no benefit so when he plays AK and queen drops|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: His hand is ded|pg||
nt|lc: He is human.|pg||
nt|poohbear: :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzpt: If he finesses -4|pg||
nt|lc: He has to guess now for -3 or -4!  (@DJ is down 4).|pg||
nt|bobh1: its good to be non-vul|pg||
nt|bobh1: undertricks don't really matter too much|pg||
nt|lc: Now, Pepsi's foresight to keep his @CQ can produce extra undertricks.|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe that is what he was thinking about before.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: And as he took some time to think about which club to play he was probably thinking that deeply about who would need entries|pg||
nt|lc: Notice that Pepsi could have cashed his @CQ here, but this is even better.|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2S made 4 in the other room|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|pc|d9|pg||
pc|dJ|mc|6|nt|poohbear: so looking at 1 4 trick swing|pg||
nt|lc: 4 more tricks in the other room.|pg||
nt|lc: Made 10 there, 6 here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Which is 138 imps against the field if the other room is a normal result|pg||
pg||

mb|1D|mb|1H!|nt|bobh1: pepsi opens his pile of junk|pg||
nt|lc: I expect them to reach 4@S now (or maybe 3NT).|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: You will never miss a Lev alert it is as though his team is justg about to score the winning touchdown|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|lc: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: 2@s funny looking|pg||
nt|lc: Possibly 1@H showed 6+ @S.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Or maybe at least 5@s.|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|lc: So, the transfer certainly has led to play from the "right" side.|pg||
nt|lc: Of course, with easy @D lead, no big difference this time.|pg||
nt|lc: Many pairs use x-fers now on this auction.  It makes for better auctions, and usually puts the overcaller on lead. Both good things.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Even so this will be hard|pg||
nt|bobh1: as i play these transfer bids, 1@s would often be a doubleton so maybe pepsi thought his hand was too good for that|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Needs 2 pitches from the north hand to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Yes as noted 3NT would be more interesting|pg||
nt|lc: I suspect 3NT is a make.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||
nt|bobh1: I'm sure lev will be shocked when 4@s goes down|pg||
nt|lc: In 3NT, after 6 rounds of @S, WEst would be dead -- surely it can be made if decalrer reads the position.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: 3NT on !Q lead and six rounds of spades what 6 cards does West keep|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|lc: Speaking of "dead," that seems to be the case here in 4@S.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c6|pc|sA|nt|lc: Still, West will not enjoy the run of the @S -- so let's see what happens.|pg||
nt|bobh1: doesn't appear to be an endplay available|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bobh1: so time for some pepsi magic|pg||
nt|lc: One of the most unplesant thing in bridge is to defend against Pepsi as he is running a long suit.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lc: He is one of the all-time best at reading the position.|pg||
nt|lc: Trust me. I've been there.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzpt: I believe he and Helgemo are the best|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h5|nt|bobh1: i wonder what deep finesse would say?|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|lc: Meckstroth isn't a slouch, either.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Try GIB now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: VG opps can't :(|pg||
nt|bobh1: if i knew how i would|pg||
nt|poohbear: this is just for the 9th trick though?|pg||
nt|lc: GIB says down 1.|pg||
nt|lc: But, we aren't done yet with the @S barrage.|pg||
nt|lc: Cheek will start to get uncomfortable.|pg||
nt|poohbear: GIB has never defended against Pepsi!|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h6|pc|d4|nt|lc: That @D discard by Pepsi surprises me a little.|pg||
nt|jbgood: Fredin went 2 off in the next room..|pg||
nt|lc: Now, if West throws a @D, Pepsi can't duck a @D to set up the long @D in dummy.|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Curtis whispers -1 to Pepsi - now there is a challenge|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c9|nt|bobh1: nice curtis|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lc: That is always a dangerous thing to do unless you are 100% sure.|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bobh1: so he mustbe 110% sure|pg||
nt|poohbear: he was right|pg||
nt|lc: Now it is a done deal.  (down 1).|pg||
pc|dA|nt|poohbear: though down 2 if Pepsi tries for @h ace onside|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|lc: True.  But, I suspect he knows from Curtis's claim where the @HA is.|pg||
nt|bobh1: maybe pepsi will go down 2 just to prove curtis wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: He has a clue not to try that - Curtis's claim|pg||
nt|lc: In all fairness to Cheek, surely the round has been called and he was trying to get on with it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Joe Grue has told Curtis off for that unless he makes a formal claim|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I wont publish Curtis's response|pg||
nt|poohbear: LOL|pg||
pc|d8|mc|9|nt|lc: This event, with so much money at stake can get stresful.|pg||
nt|lc: stressful.|pg||
nt|lc: 12 deals to go.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Closing and reopening|pg||
