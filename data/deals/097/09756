mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzps: We have to close and reopen for security as we are only given 3 boards at a time. With so much money on the line this is understandable|pg||
nt|petergill: From Saturday's Bulletin, Joel Wooldridge - Tom Carmichael won the side event, but we do not have a list of scores for it|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|vugraphzps: That was last year's result|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|reisig: 3N is aggressive ..but sane|pg||
nt|dburn: then one would think the scores should be available, at any rate|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: I like to give partner and out if he hates his hand - one of those hands if he has 3 hearts I like it if he has two then not so much|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Expensive @S9|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it was the normal play|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: All standings here http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/2009/PAIRS5O.htm|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: I agree but in this case epensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Oh where to start|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: How about @C to queen and low heart|pg||
nt|henryb: apparently they will not post the other pair event until it is final|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Hard to see where 9 tricks will come from|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
nt|reisig: 8 tricks are tough enough here|pg||
nt|henryb: I think it is hard to see eight|pg||
nt|henryb: Cheek might have done better to return a @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Diamond heart through and diamond would have put paid to anything|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: losing 1-2-4-0|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|henryb: but declarer's attack on diamonds suggested he might have 4, which made it very dancerous|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Unblock of @h10 may have been better|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|reisig: going from bad to worse|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: worse to worser more like it|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||
nt|henryb: I guess down 4 is now par|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: An extra 100 is like 69 imps to worth the fight|pg||
nt|dburn: I'm not sure sure this started life as "bad" - going from disastrous to catastrophic seems about right|pg||
pc|h4|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h3|nt|vugraphzps: Better cash now|pg||
pc|d2|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|hT|nt|henryb: no. the imp scale dows not work that way. the first 100 cost 3 "real" imps, the additional ones about 2|pg||
mc|6|nt|dburn: still, these days it is the norm to bid game with those South cards, vulnerable, so the extra undertricks will be worth a good few points to Cheek and Grue|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb: 5-4-2-2 1NT openers have also become the norm. soon we will all be copying Fantunes and opening 4-4-4-1 with 1N|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|dburn: 2=4=5=2 is perhaps the most common shape that reguarly gets opened 1NT|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|henryb: and 2-2-4-5|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|dburn: with 4=2=5=2, say, you can open 1@d and rebid 1@s|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: I cant believe I am having this discussion with a friend - whether being at the Cavendish is better than sex - we disagree but I'll leave you to work it out|pg||
nt|dburn: and with 2=2=4=5 you can open one diamond as an alternative perversion to the natural order of things|pg||
nt|henryb: hands with 4 spades are easy; hands where the 5 card suit is higher ranking are easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Rich my chin is out there where are you|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||
nt|henryb: hands with four hearts and a five card minor are more likely to cause problems after you open the minor and partner bids 1@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: It is intersting as some do it with 5-4-2-2 where the stuff is in the doubletons and others the opposite|pg||
nt|reisig: does anyone make a choice based on who partner is?|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Yes most bridge professionals|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|henryb: m-a-y-b-e|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|c4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|reisig: when I look up and see Benito ...I never bid NT  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Or Alvin Roth I suspect|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||
nt|henryb: I would never bid NT in that situation whatever my hand :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: If you;re two doubletons were AQ AQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: who said we will have a lot of down time here|pg||
nt|henryb: I meant with Benito as my partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: OH I am board with that|pg||
nt|henryb: I did|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|c2|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|h5|nt|vugraphzps: On Board I should have said|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Or maybe freudian slip|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Low club now and then pin the nine|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Good bye to the rest of the tricks|pg||
nt|reisig: OK OK 100|pg||
mc|7|nt|vugraphzps: Everybody claimed at the same time|pg||

nt|henryb: Ron Smith reports that opening 1N with a stiff is catching on: Hampson did it three times in a 12 board match|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Up next we have Diamond Greco against Cheek Grue and in round 34 we have Lecin Weinstein vs Cheek and Grue so only one BBO table that round|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb: no pinochle, no meld, how could you opem?|pg||
nt|dburn: do you mean opening with a singleton, or playing with a corpse?|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: After Diamond Greco we have Cohler/Seamon and then Helness/helgemo|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzps: By far the best lead here|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Everything else gives something away|pg||
nt|henryb: I mean with a singleton; with a corpse it hasalways been de rigeur; after all, le mort cannot play a hand|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|dburn: well, a diamond would have been OK also|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Yes 3 rounds of diamondsmay be better|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
nt|dburn: but a trump is certainly the normal choice|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h4|nt|reisig: Maybe ..not opening was the winner|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|dburn: well, North did not have to drive to game - if partner is prone to opening that sort of hand especially|pg||
nt|henryb: there must be some reason Alvin said don't open those hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: How about low diamond now|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|mc|8|nt|reisig: 4-3-3-3 ..12's with 3 Jacks...yuck|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Closing and reopening|pg||
