mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ritong: difficult|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Not a time to be bidding Kevin|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: i suspect david is back:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Wont pick diamonds now and may mispick spades as well|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzpt: Not now anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Tis moi Henri - David|pg||
nt|mittmouse: he may now misguess diamonds but they needed to lead a h|pg||
nt|ritong: richie s gone|pg||
nt|ritong: no need for south to force with @s Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Yes as noted hard to defend if he mispicks diamonds the defence will likely lose their heart trick as South cant attack hearts|pg||

nt|ritong: ite missa est|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: So it needed to be a heart lead|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|mittmouse: right and a d misguess|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: South may try @HK here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ritong: different elements for declarer|pg||
nt|mittmouse: but even with a h lead its not easy after he lays down a high club n may rise with the d ace |pg||
nt|ritong: he does not know where @d A is, and wonders why south did not play back the @h K if he holds it|pg||
nt|ritong: so, all in all, i would try @h J|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Yes as noted the @HK would have been faster|pg||
nt|ritong: with south|pg||
nt|mittmouse: with a h lead he may run the j of s on this auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Yes Henry I think you have a point - if he had the @HK playing it back would make more sense|pg||
nt|ritong: in order to shoot out @h A when @ds are not good|pg||
nt|mittmouse: well it doesnt matter what he does|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: But of course he doesnt know that|pg||
nt|ritong: but the bet goes to his choice, and why|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Its taking everything I know not to yell out it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|mittmouse: too bad its not a long match at least making declarer work may pay dividends later|pg||
nt|ritong: relax, david|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick ...|pg||

mb|2S|nt|ritong: yes they do|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Good raise|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|ritong: apart a weird double from brad in 5@d when he got redoubled, scoresheet looks fine|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Bathurst will have to act to shoow his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: And 2NT -4|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Vul|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpt: Easy 4@S now|pg||
nt|mittmouse: if lall now bids 3d will bathurst bid a game|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpt: Lots of pussyfooting around and nobody wanting to commit|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Bidding 1NT and then bidding 4@S over 2@D may have better described South's hand|pg||
nt|ritong: you mean that they estimate not to have enough info to conclude|pg||
