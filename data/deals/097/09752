mb|p|mb|1C|nt|lc: It would be smart of South to stay out.|pg||
nt|lc: This would not be the time for a macho (stupid) 1NT overcall.|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT looks normal|pg||
mb|d|nt|lc: Opp a PH I think it too risky.|pg||
nt|lc: I am not being double-dummy here -- |pg||
mb|r|nt|petergill: but Dbl works better than 1NT|pg||
nt|lc: I just don't think Game is likely opp PH.|pg||
nt|lc: But, I do expect half the field to commit a 1NT overcall.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: I guess it isn't so "stupid"  Too harsh a description.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Anyway, I have been brainwashed by Berkowitz -- he would NEVER overcall 1NT with this hand.|pg||
nt|petergill: When you hear the Redbl, you might think "happy I didn't overcall 1NT"|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lc: Surely, many tables will play 1NX by South.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lc: This should be interesting. |pg||
nt|lc: Dec will knock out Aces. Def will play @H ...|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|lc: That leads to 2@C, 3@D, 2@H, @SA --  that's 8 -- and where they are 8...|pg||
nt|lc: Oh, I see the lead was a @D.|pg||
nt|lc: Hmmm.  a sneak attack,.|pg||
nt|petergill: Not a great lead. On a heart lead, South has to find two discards on the @d's, whcih might make it interesting|pg||
nt|lc: It seems like a @H lead would have beaten it.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lc: Yes -- I expected that @H lead -- and the intersting position Peter mentions.|pg||
nt|lc: Indeed, South might have been squashed on the @D.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|lc: Still, there is a little work to do.|pg||
nt|petergill: The other BBO table has found the @H lead, so the play there will be more interesting than here|pg||
nt|lc: DEclarer expects, but can't be sure, that South has the @CA and @SK.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s7|pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c5|pc|d9|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|petergill: A desperate try by Bart. |pg||
nt|petergill: Will it work?|pg||
nt|lc: If you are going to blank a king, it is good to do so casually and early.|pg||
nt|mslair: nice tempo=ed spade jack|pg||
nt|petergill: Bramley bared that king smoothly, like a man who had four spades originally would do|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lc: Dec still is looking at only 8 sure tricks.|pg||
nt|petergill: However, North's failures to lead a heart at Trick 1 might suggest that North does not have five @h's|pg||
nt|lc: Dec can duck this, win next one, but will then face a guess in the ending.|pg||
nt|petergill: or might not if North thinks his hand is entryless|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|petergill: Great defence by Bramley. |pg||
pc|h3|nt|lc: Now after @CQ, @CJ, dec might try to endplay South -- playing him to have started with 4=3=2=4.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|cJ|nt|lc: So much for the endplay. |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|s2|nt|lc: Surprised he didn't keep a low @C in dummy.|pg||
nt|lc: Now he has no choice but to make it.|pg||
nt|lc: What a shame.|pg||
nt|petergill: The club pitch from  dummy commits declarer to success|pg||
mc|10|nt|lc: Bramley's great play goes unrewarded.|pg||
pg||
qx|o26|st||md|4S7HAJ7DA9863CA976,SAQJT93H6D75CKJT5,SK854HK32DKQ2CQ82,S62HQT9854DJT4C43|sv|b|nt|lc: Surely, dec should have kept a low @C in dummy and left options.|pg||
nt|petergill: Michel Bessis knows how good Bramley is at card play|pg||
nt|lc: A similar position may develop at the other table -- if it hasn't already.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|lc: He still could have kept a little @C :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lc: 3NT?|pg||
nt|lc: A popular (good) convention gaining in popularity is the 3NT transfer.|pg||
nt|petergill: In the World Card Play competition in Lille in 1998, Bramley came a close 2nd or 3rd (Rosenberg won), and would have won but for an accident I think|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lc: North bids 3@S to say, "Partner, please bid 3NT" -- play it from your side.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Very good method -- puts the wrong hand for them on lead.|pg||
nt|lc: Also a good client-pro convention :)|pg||
nt|lc: I didn't say that, though :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps @SJ then @S7 might have been an even better illusion|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lc: Is this 2N invitational?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Seems strange.  Most play it that way in comp.  But with 13 HCP?|pg||
nt|lc: Admitedly a bad 13.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lc: I would have led my partner's suit, I have to admit.  It keep him happy.|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, only overtricks at stake here.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|lc: So you guys think Passell really just invited?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c5|nt|petergill: Not sure|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|mc|11|pg||
qx|o27|st||md|1SQJ7HAQ3DJ84CA975,S942HKT865DA6C432,SK83H9742DQT72CT8,SAT65HJDK953CKQJ6|sv|o|nt|lc: Borads 23-24-25 were thrillers -- I suspect they will be in the Daily Bulletin tomorrow.|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Last board of this session|pg||
nt|lc: yes, then 30 "tonight"|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Im trying to get the standings|pg||
nt|lc: Then 1 final session Sunday.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lc: 14-16, I suspect.|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: next session starts in about 80 min|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 14-16 perhaps?|pg||
mb|d!|nt|lc: Most systems don't allow for 3-suiters like East's over 1NT.|pg||
nt|lc: Catalina -- can you see what it shows?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|lc: As we do this last deal, thanks to Catalina (Vugraph), BBO, fellow-commentators and all of you who watched.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzps: next session we will have Cheek and Grue|pg||
nt|lc: Looks like some sort of either/or minor/major thingee.|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Dls is a 5card minor + a mayor|pg||
nt|lc: Some days you just have no 8-card fits.|pg||
nt|lc: So, he lied a little :)|pg||
nt|lc: Nobody likes to pass 1NT in passout seat.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: 2@S looks like it has a good chance to make|pg||
nt|lc: So, 2@D must have said "what is your major."|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: They write very tiny in the paper, not easy to read it from here|pg||
nt|lc: This looks like a good lead.|pg||
nt|lc: Usually when dec has shown 2 suits, and dummy preferences one of them, you lead a trump (expecting dummy to ruff the other suit).|pg||
nt|lc: South's @C9 is a big card.|pg||
nt|lc: It might take a while before the def figures out that South is not the 5-4 he has "promised."|pg||
nt|lc: East, that is.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|petergill: If you take diamond ruff(s), you remove your entry to @HK later on|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|lc: This looks like South will eventually have to underlead in @C.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|dT|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|lc: Not any more.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lc: Maybe Bramley couldn't figure out the shape -- he had to play more trumps.|pg||
nt|petergill: Souh couldn;'t tell that declarer didn't have @SAK10, hence no @s continuation|pg||
nt|lc: Right.  Easier seeing all 4 hands.|pg||
nt|lc: I wonder if N-S will complain about the explanation. "I would have beaten this if I knew declarer could be 4-4."|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|petergill: home now,110 I think|pg||
nt|lc: If North gave honest @C count, maybe Bramley knows 4=1=4=4 -- but he can't do anything about it at this point.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|lc: Surely, declarer has 2 more @S tricks and the good @CJ.|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: OK David stern Here|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: I have some scores veryh incomplete for the last round but...............|pg||
nt|lc: To cover the last 5 tricks of the session?|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: I think South thought East had 5 clubs and was trying to give North his club ruff earlier. |pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Levin Weinstein 3581|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Bramley Passell 1797|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Moss Gitelman 1567|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Lev Pepsi 1439|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Goldberg Eisenberg 1306|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Bessis x 2 1292|pg||
nt|petergill: 1800 imps divided by 25 tables is still a massive lead of about 72 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Thats all I have for you|pg||
nt|lc: They should rename this the Levin-Weinstein Pairs|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: will keep table open while I find out more|pg||
nt|lc: Weinstein gunning for his SIXTH win.  The pair for their FOURTH.|pg||
nt|lc: Hard to imagine -- there is so much of a luck factor -- for one pair to do so consistantly well.|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: will leave table to suss out some more information|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Hang in there for 5 minutes|pg||
nt|lc: And I'm not implying anything. THere is 0% chance of any "funny business."|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Cata|pg||
nt|lc: They are good.  But still.. amazing.|pg||
nt|lc: So the pairs we are watching are in 2nd and 5th place -- lots of money involved for those positions.|pg||
nt|petergill: Thx David, it's David Stern providing the info|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Next session our BBO jockkeys are Levin-Weinstein and Cheek-Grue who will be playing each other in one round to give one operator a break|pg||
nt|lc: Sounds like fun.|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: What was the result of this hand so I can claim it|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lc: Prob 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|petergill: 110 to EW I think|pg||
mc|9|nt|lc: Thanks all.  Bye.|pg||
nt|petergill: About 98% chance of 8 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Excuse me for a few minutes while I do some detective work|pg||
nt|petergill: Bye all. Until 40 minutes from now. |pg||
nt|vugraphzps: There are some tables still in play so could be as mnuch as 10 mins|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Restart 1:05 from now 16:30 PDT|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: So I will be doing  cheek/Grue on VG2 and Barry Goren will be doing Levin Weinstein on VG1|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: I = David Stern|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: The kind director is chasing results for all you folks|pg||
