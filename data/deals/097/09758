pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|petergill: After 3 sessions, NS are coming 2nd, EW coming 1st of the 48 pairs. |pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: After the quiet partscore, a bit more action here|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|bjacobs: Where would you want to end up here?  In a partscore probably, but in fact either 3NT or 5@C will get home|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: What would you open that North hand with Peter?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: both contracts need good breaks albeit in different suits|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|petergill: Hard for NS to tell that with @D's 4-4 - !!! on this bidding - and with clubs 3-3, 3NtTis on|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: me2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: ok I'll keep quiet|pg||
mb|3S|nt|petergill: like any good American would|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: what should a good Australian do?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: driink beer|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C perhaps?|pg||
nt|petergill: Acol is a 12-14 1NT, alcohol is a 12-14 2NT ... |pg||
nt|bjacobs: I would open 2@C, despairing of ever describing the hand after 1@C.  It's a 4 loser 20 count - that's ample for me|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But I love the Alcoholic 2NT opening!|pg||
nt|petergill: Ref to last round: Wigoder won the Cavendish Teams in 2004 when he was not playing the weak 2NT opening|pg||
nt|petergill: Does 4@S make?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: Brad seriously tanking. Dying to bid 3nt|pg||
nt|bjacobs: On a diamond tap, you can duck a spade|pg||
mb|4D|nt|bjacobs: Well, maybe that's too superficial|pg||
nt|petergill: Clever 1@d overcall by Bobby Levin to divert NS from 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: the preemptive 1@d causing serious problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: In fact, ducking a spade in 4@S might not be too good|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H is very awkward - no small trumps to ruff @d with|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S has small trumps for the @D ruffs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks like 4@D is a "choice-of-games-cue-bid"|pg||
nt|petergill: So Fred has to guess if partner has QJxxx in @H or Kxx in spades|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|petergill: 5@C makes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: asl long as you don't run @C10|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzpr: Fred thanks Brad|pg||
nt|petergill: Well done to reach game, even if it is a dodgy game.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: at least it declares pretty fast|pg||
nt|petergill: any game that makes is a good game, I suppose|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's all you can say.  It seems to need clubs 3-3 and spades 3-3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: Fred asks if the 8 is Suit preference. Bobby says no Count|pg||

nt|petergill: In 2@DX, can NS pitch a spade on clubs and get all their nine side suit tricks for -4 and 800 - I think they might be able to.|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s4|mc|11|nt|bjacobs: Actually, it's better than spades 3-3, as the 8 and 9 of spades gives declarer real extra chances|pg||
nt|petergill: in 5@C, if West has 4-4 majors, you duck a spade to try to squeeze West on some layouts |pg||

mb|2H|nt|petergill: Another interesting hand coming up, I think|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: They will be in 4@S in a flash ... and down some time later|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: nope|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: i predict 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: Weinstein thinking|pg||
nt|petergill: IMPS scoring, and Levin - Weinstein have a huge lead of 70 imps or so. Gitelman - Moss are 2nd, just ahead of a pack of challengers. This is Session 4 of 5. |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: OK, cancel the flash|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/webcam/1/table1.jpg for webcam of other table|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|nt|petergill: It shows Curtis Cheek and Fred Stewart on webcam1|pg||
nt|bjacobs: cool lead!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: Weinstein asks about 5 card suits. Told yea|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Will South smoothly duck in spades?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: he will|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is what South will be thinking, right now.  What do I do on a spade to the queen?  Or @S10 run?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Actually, right now, he's thinking about what to lead to trick 2 ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Probably a club I suppose.  But a spade return would be quite imaginative|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bjacobs: Or a diamond ... :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|petergill: Yes, cool lead, and Steve Weinstein is glad South doesn't have another heart. He still has entry problems and the need for a 9th trick, but South has difficulty getting off play|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: was hoping for a stiff ace of @ds in declarer's hand|pg||
nt|petergill: Excellent switch by Brad Moss I think. A cool duck of @SK is needed too!!!!|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bjacobs: yes ... although ...|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|petergill: Wow!!!!!!!!|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A strange cool duck ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: of the non-finesse|pg||
nt|petergill: These guys are the world's best, and we can see why. |pg||
nt|petergill: They play better with 26 cards visible than we do with 52 cards visible. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now declarer must be scratching his head ... |pg||
nt|bjacobs: He knows EITHER player might have ducked that @SK|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Steve Weinstein will play North for @SKxx. |pg||
nt|petergill: This hand will be in the Bulletin for sure|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, South could easily have @CK as well ... in fact, that tends to explain the diamond shift|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bjacobs: In which case the only play is to return to hand and actually take the finesse|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Spec made a good comment - what about the @CQ play, to flush out the @CK?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A bit double dummy, perhaps|pg||
nt|petergill: I think it's webcam1 http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/webcam/1/table1.jpg to see the look on their faces |pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: Weinstein is one of the world's best poker players. Lets see if he spots a " tell"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But when South doesn't cover, play him for the @SK and hope it drops|pg||
nt|petergill: wrong|pg||
nt|petergill: me wrong I mean|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh I assumed that Peter :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: Weinstein asks whether 3D would be forcing . told yes|pg||
nt|petergill: no it's webcam2 http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/webcam/2/table2.jpg|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If he finesses now, I think he goes 5 off|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: Moss is a pretty damn good poker player too|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Maybe 4 off|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|bjacobs: what a decision|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's making that @CQ suggestion look really really good|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dburn: curious - was expecting the @s10 from North|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mslair: wow|pg||
nt|petergill: on webcam2 it's Steve Weinstein on left and Fred Gitelman on the right|pg||
mc|11|nt|bjacobs: I actually think the @S6 was ok - wasn't 9 from South as equally likely from 109 as 96?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: negotiated|pg||
