nt|lestergold: wow|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: What a fun hand|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4NT opening is best with the North hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: good hand for 4NT opening |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Specific Ace Asking|pg||
nt|yuval10: asking for specific aces|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And partner has two aces, but not the right one|pg||
nt|hedyg: you do?|pg||
nt|daman: Canadian ears|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why team-name Iceland Juniors I am asked. Because that team won the Nordic Junior Championships in Iceland recently|pg||
nt|yuval10: wow|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if north got that right it would have been seriously impressive|pg||
nt|cicus: nice shapes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our first comparison is due|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: north has an old fashioned 4n opener if people still play that|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Old fashioned?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  two huge double fits and @s is the boss suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: the babe or the cards?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: 1NT is a good option with the N hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h X is a very good result for DBK|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: great result for the "juniors" from the other table, as 6@h is cold|pg||
nt|cicus: hehe|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: n/s should find their heart game|pg||
nt|yuval10: whereas 5@d is , at the very least, a good sacrifice|pg||
nt|hedyg: should reach it quickly now|pg||
nt|yuval10: surely X now from W|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@H is on|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is a normal contract, but I don't think it can make |pg||
mb|2H!|nt|lestergold: well i play it so it must be|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 3h overcall by S is arguably too good a hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@H Dbl 3@H or 2@H Passl 3@H is not an invitation, the opener is expected, or even demanded, not to bid again|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Passing the East hand is losing bridge|pg||
nt|daman: no kidding|pg||
nt|hedyg: i agree Mike|pg||
nt|daman: NS did well in the CR to get to 4@H and make|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like NS will stay out of game here|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow 11-16 is quite a range|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|hedyg: bad @H suit and get the strength across|pg||
nt|roswolf: the elephants in the other room survived with a plus score at least|pg||
nt|hedyg: amazing pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is even worse|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|hedyg: and now punish pd for balancing|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: it was gtailor made for this hand|pg||
nt|thegarve:  on this occasion specific suited Michaels would be best|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mtvesuvius: I think 4NT as specific aces isn't old fashioned... and I play it, and it's come up... believe it or not.|pg||
nt|lestergold: east was never having any of that 4h we know that !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Played by West in the other room, and Cecilia Rimstedt got off to the best start for the defence: a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 4@d now|pg||
nt|lestergold: of clourse it does|pg||
nt|daman: lose 6 IMPs    |pg||
nt|yuval10: this will produce 6 or 7 imps for "the babes", they continue the good start|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: A bit strong for a 15-17 1NT|pg||
nt|petergill: with all those tens|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree but north in the other room took a pessimistic view|pg||
nt|daman: what dpoes South need to double this one?|pg||
nt|daman: a drink maybe|pg||
nt|thegarve:  two teams have raced away from he field - Iceland Juniors ain Fillps fanclub|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Hence the upgrade to 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|hedyg: now a @c lead..|pg||
nt|hedyg: she is happy with the contract|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Not a very good start for NS in the CR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Helin did what you should never do: raised partner's jump to 6@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: so does she , thus rebid|pg||
nt|lestergold: west not learning not to believe partner|pg||
nt|hedyg: W has a normal double|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: west 's double is perfectly understandable|pg||
nt|hedyg: can expect 1 trick from pd who opened|pg||
nt|daman: took a dim view|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: Granath will be sleeping on the sofa in the living room tonight, says his girlfriend :)|pg||
nt|daman: and what contract would she not be happy with?|pg||
nt|hedyg: they better cash the @C trick|pg||
nt|hedyg: @s lead in CR|pg||
nt|cicus: so X was a raise|pg||
nt|lestergold: east you must save but pard did it for u|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf: now@CQ|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: If he had been interested in your two aces, he would have asked|pg||
nt|lestergold: still north has many ways of forcing partner to cue the ace of clubs and south didnt so ...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: ok, good stop|pg||
nt|yuval10: and 14 imps|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Must be disappointing for North, but it's a nice auction and a good stop|pg||
nt|lestergold: sounds like a bridge cime was committed in the closed|pg||
nt|daman: thought the babes were the NS team|pg||
nt|yuval10: 11 imps it will be for the "Juniors"|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s4|nt|lestergold: i mean  i know certain players who would open s with north and another few who would think that they should bid 7 with two aces opposite|pg||
nt|yuval10: then it's easy to make 10|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: partner does have one trick|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: no George|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yuval10: one may wonder how only 10 tricks were made on the other table|pg||
nt|hedyg: she might get @s wrong now that she does not know the A@D is in W|pg||
nt|yuval10: it's not like you can misguess @s's|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: the ant finds the true path|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|hedyg: you can|pg||
nt|yuval10: no...they're EW|pg||
nt|daman: ok  gotcha|pg||
pc|s8|nt|daman: i thought erik and karl were men's names|pg||
pc|c3|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: especially if you play E for AKJ@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: u can play one from hand u mean Hedy!|pg||
nt|yuval10: @c loser is going over the K@d and you only lose 1@d, 1@s and 1@h at most|pg||
pc|h8|nt|roswolf: curtains|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petergill: Another contract bites the dust. In youth bridge, many contracts bite the dust (go down). |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Jim Tritt|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, maybe he was not too strong for 1NT after all....|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|hedyg: but now A@D will drop|pg||
pc|c8|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|h7|nt|petergill: Just needed @DKJ onside (25% chance), and spades probably 3-3, reducing the overall chance to about 8%, once a club lead was found with clubs 5-3.  |pg||

mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Andrew Webb|pg||
nt|tejjyid: hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ahhhh Klinger has switched partners!   earlier sets with Matt Mullamphy|pg||
mb|4S|nt|nigel: Fun stuff Klinger and Lilley were once Australia's premier pair..So bragging rights whoever wins|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so, maybe the answer tothe questions about who has the most partners is Klinger|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nigel: Klinger Hoffman play in the Seniors, Klinger Mullamphy play open|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|tejjyid: well, thisis certainly a Seniors table now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|nigel: Correct....very much so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think either identical system or maybe some lineups switch meaning of artificial 1M-2m auctions|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|nigel: Though age perhaps has sen their games improve!|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: If partner cared about your aces, he would have asked|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry all, she could not misguess of course|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it's very good to play the K anyway... W hardly can have 3 aces|pg||
nt|daman: too complicated    just get a client and use their name like we do on this side of the pond|pg||
nt|yuval10: Both south players, here and on the other table, are girls|pg||
nt|hedyg: junior client?|pg||
nt|daman: sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: :(|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|lestergold: I do not see why east bid 5d over 4h|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 4h looks iffy, but makeable|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: how about playing bridge for fun, honour and fame?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: or even slightly better than that|pg||
nt|hedyg: even!|pg||
nt|petergill: Vulnerable games at IMPS should be about 35% chance to be worth bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: in front of partner|pg||
nt|daman: might be a dounle partscore swing on this|pg||
nt|daman: double*|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|yuval10: North did well with his distributional hand , so now he gets another one|pg||
mb|d!|nt|Walddk2: Another normal game. Has a better chance if played by East|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i thought 40%|pg||
nt|lestergold: Adam you are right o course you are but players often go wrong with these hands|pg||
nt|hedyg: he likes to bid a lot|pg||
nt|daman: EW are on for 3@D|pg||
nt|thegarve:  surprising to give up to 5@S at the other table|pg||
nt|wygbe1: entries are a problem though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Arvidsson has a maximum for his 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: OK|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah i cee Hedy|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: my partners always bid 2@d..|pg||
nt|yuval10: mine too|pg||
nt|yuval10: correction - 3@d|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS have a lot of experience already in playing national and international competitions|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Passing 2@C would not cross my mind|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i dont think this is going to be a success|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: i will try 35%..|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 1@h promises 3@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think South has a X here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2h high enuf on these cards|pg||
nt|lestergold: vulnerable south cant safely back into this|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5c has play but north may have tried 3h which says bid 3n if u have a heart guard to pard|pg||
nt|wygbe1: that lead blew the whole heart suit as well|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: hmm not a good double but hard to pass even if not a junior|pg||
nt|hedyg: i trust you Peter|pg||
nt|petergill: @D7 or @Dq back as suit pref to show @HK?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hed like to double |pg||
nt|lestergold: roland is in slam here|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is the one to bid a lot if you will play AK@H|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sorry specs; we don't have E-W's CC, so we can't tell what 1@S is|pg||
nt|lestergold: its the rubberneck slam|pg||
nt|wygbe1: low club works well here|pg||
nt|thegarve:  should make 10 tricks picking up the @h suit|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: has play? it's infrangible as you used to say|pg||
nt|lestergold: if they play that|pg||
nt|yuval10: same lead, probably same result|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hedyg: restrained 3@s bid|pg||
nt|petergill: even at the expense of wasting the Beer Card|pg||
pc|c6|nt|yuval10: too easy for Roland|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|hedyg: nor 1@c..|pg||
nt|thegarve:  lest see if he makes 12 |pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like a sort of a "raptor 1NT" on the other table|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|nt|hedyg: ok lets guess, strong @c, 1@s 8+ with @hs, 2@c checkback, 3NT= i was not interested in your 4 @ss..|pg||
nt|daman: all roads led to 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: at unfavourable i think risk outweighs gain with tah hand|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1NT there was probably 4 cards @h and 5+ cards minor|pg||
nt|thegarve:  playing @c reduces that to 9 tricks|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|roswolf: yes very disciplined but prudent since north was under pressure and ,as here,may have to stretch to find a bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: do EW have a chance at 4@H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i guess not on a @c lead|pg||
pc|d7|nt|daman: there are 4 losers unless NS fail to cash their @Ds|pg||
nt|lestergold: at mps i agree|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|yuval10: so it was easy for N to bid 2@h with 4 cards support|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cicus: there is a @D guess but will get that right I believe|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 9@s|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|petergill: South might have played @D10 at Trick 1 to disguise the @d position, but East has played W for @DK109 anyway|pg||
nt|hedyg: she needs to play @s from dummy to get rid of the @c losers|pg||
nt|cicus: I mean for 6|pg||
nt|thegarve:  ahh mike's panted word - infrangible|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: Not much else Sjöberg can play when in with @SJ|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|daman: trop tarde|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Olofsson's reasoning for passing the take-out double must have been "Even if it makes, it is not game". Wrong philosophy in my opinion. Too weak to pass. Natural 2@D response|pg||
pc|h9|nt|thegarve:  patented|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: i want my commisions please|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: finesse is for chickens? real men play AK?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: that would be 2@d and 1@s loser only|pg||
pc|d9|nt|hedyg: J@C?|pg||

nt|daman: then declarer can pitch 2@Cs on the @Ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: would be for free|pg||
pc|h7|nt|petergill: since partner (West) had natural trump tricks, missing the ruff did not cost|pg||

nt|rodal f: But was worce. Lilly had a lead at 58 by the best. Last session was a 3 in for Lilly after Del Montte was 10 behind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my opinion - Lilley team has been steadier -- actually picking up many imps for staying low / being less active in competition|pg||

nt|lestergold: these slam level errors are very expensive|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes amazing|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Not sure how they control that|pg||
nt|daman: with great skill|pg||
nt|hedyg: well maybe it is 11-13 NV and 14-16 vuln?|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like -2 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: slam exploration is legitimate here but the club hole should easily be identified|pg||
nt|Walddk2: PO asked how it went|pg||
mb|1N|nt|daman: mod capp rescue over the double|pg||
nt|daman: I play that with weak NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: we talked earlier about not asking RKCB with a void, now we can see why asking RKCB with 2 quick losers in a suit is wrong, too|pg||
nt|hedyg: W could have passed|pg||
nt|yuval10: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: that's why they invented cue-bids|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: exactly, especially when partner had the chance to cuebid it|pg||
nt|wygbe1: reaching 6c on this one was pretty ambitious|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H  8+  no 5-card major, no 6-card minor|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 1h a trans, probly|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|mtvesuvius: now North shouldn't even explore|pg||
nt|hedyg: X over the mini NT is penalty|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2 matches ago, Sandra's 3rd hand 1NT led to -800 for their side|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Bd 2 in 4@H: Three rounds of clubs to stop the @d's being set up in time, then declarer tries to crossruff, but I think 4@H fails. |pg||
nt|daman: 2@C would be modified capp|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't know that Mike Cappelletti would allow his name to be used in that context|pg||
nt|daman: he does|pg||
nt|hedyg: i take that back, last time he had 14 nv|pg||
nt|po-s: did he guess D?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|hedyg: 2NT jacoby with 3 cards?|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C = any minimum|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: i suppose the problem is that you play for qh to drop then u have tio fall back on finding qd and tyhere wont be a lot of info to get from the defenders|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: miscounted not 20/20 19/21|pg||
nt|yuval10: another good result for the "Iceland juniors" team...looks like declarer misguessed @d's on the other room|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Roland would make 6@c|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i see|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|petergill: Yes, Swedish Jacoby|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, Phantom City |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am looking forward to watching our next match (in about 1 hour and 5 minutes). Viktor vs Tre hunkar o en babe (Three cool dudes and a babe). Interesting team name!|pg||
nt|lestergold: adn they are listening to you adam|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: well bided , and 10 more imps|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 2c looks like making |pg||
nt|hedyg: well another 1 cost them a lot|pg||
nt|lestergold: so not much of a swing here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|petergill: I slightly prefer Swedish Jacoby to American Jacoby|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes they bided their tiem i agree|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Nice stop. 10 more imps to Victor...|pg||
nt|lestergold: bad yoke|pg||
nt|lestergold: I would like a tame hand now please so i can make a coffee|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: because?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not sure of the continuation, but I know they are in the right contract|pg||
nt|thegarve:  I play this 1H method in a strong @c system, 1NT =  min bal say 18-20 and 1@S is a relay, extras balanced on semi-blanced or 5M|pg||
pc|hK|nt|thegarve:  2H/S would show 6M|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|hedyg: oh......|pg||
nt|lestergold: only info will be west showing out now in hearts thus making it fractionally more likely that he holds qd|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|hedyg: where Rimstedt ended playing 2@c X and made 3 tricks i think|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yuval10: yes that was the one i was talking about Hedy|pg||
nt|yuval10: it was corrected to -4|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh ok, sry|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yuval10: "only"  -800|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: why not just play @s?|pg||
nt|cicus: as E will be known to hold @SA+@HQ+@CK west will be more likely to hold @DQ|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|lestergold: a spade return may have beaten this|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: only? it was scored as 1100|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is true too|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: so i lay money on this being flat|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|yuval10: as i said, it was corrected later to -800|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: if n/s can get a spade ruff in as well as enjoy their two dim tricks im not sure declarer should have played the qd on oppening lead|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|daman: the coach for NS just informed me 2@C showed a major/minor 2 suiter    so....I guess they play modified capp in Sweden|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yuval10: looks like West was sure that East has a singel @s ...but it doesn't matter as K@s + @s establish the suit anyway...|pg||
nt|thegarve:  will play on @s to get one final clue|pg||
nt|lestergold: another round or two of discovery plays now which wont discover what he wants to know unfortuantel|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: where did south think they were finding 6 tricks from?|pg||
nt|hedyg: exactly|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 3n could actually have gone down, but the heart lead will make the 9th trick easy|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|petergill: In American Jacoby, opener has to show his singleton straightaway even on hands where only 4M will be reached, which can help the defence. |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|hedyg: ok i see your point|pg||
nt|hedyg: but it does help responder evaluate his honours|pg||
pc|sK|nt|daman: as a resce|pg||
nt|daman: rescue|pg||
nt|lestergold: east anxious to show off all his high cards maybe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He had no choice|pg||
nt|lestergold: mayeb south might suspect a deliberate bluff|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He covered @S9?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When is that right? Never|pg||
nt|wygbe1: covering the spade nine not a good play|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yuval10: cashing out for a rather disappointed -1|pg||
nt|yuval10: could've been -3 in one point|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hedyg: defense was not best|pg||
nt|daman: total misdefense|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What else but a spade could he return?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need Flash Player 9, some don't. ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|petergill: In Swedish Jacoby, opener rebids 3@C with any minimum, then 3@d asks for singletons - this provides more bidding space to explore slam or signoff without giving so much information ...|pg||
nt|petergill: to the defenders|pg||
nt|lestergold: he didnt have to play spade J|pg||
nt|po-s: why he might ask, not a club or ST|pg||
nt|lestergold: club|pg||
nt|po-s: perhaps he has no more clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: who would get this right now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: you cos you know the layout|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he leads declarer to believe he is out of clubs then it will help place the dim q!|pg||
nt|yuval10: Buretti-Lanzarotti perhaps :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|4C|nt|rodal f: If Ron bid now there are no sakrifice. But got it anyway|pg||

nt|lestergold: minors v majors|pg||
nt|daman: they have to hunkar down with their defense|pg||
nt|yuval10: they still hold a very solid position in this match|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hedyg: so far..|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: e/w have the balance biut duplication in hearts and a misfit|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c weak in @d or strong?|pg||
nt|hedyg: wish we had a CC for EW|pg||
nt|lestergold: must  be weak|pg||
nt|hedyg: anyhow looks like it|pg||
nt|yuval10: I can't find any lead to beat 3NT from East here|pg||
nt|yuval10: not even K@s, which kills the @d suit, but declarer can play on @c's anyway and make 9|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|yuval10: Fantunes-style 2@s ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n by east of course a lucky spot because north not on lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: a nice solid 3n for a flat board|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: In Swedish Jacoby, responder can also shows his own singleton over 3@C if he prefers, which is useful with hands too strong to splinter|pg||
nt|hedyg: N feeling sick|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks likely that they'll gain some imps over here, too|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|hedyg: so more flexible in your opinion|pg||
nt|hedyg: no 1@s bid by N|pg||
nt|petergill: And Swedish Jacoby, sometimes called Stenberg I think, allows 2NT on suitable hands with 3 card support too. |pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: no undo|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol ok Johnny|pg||
nt|hedyg: we believe you!|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|daman: and only over a weak NT opening   not over a strong NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c?|pg||
nt|hedyg: better now|pg||
nt|yuval10: brave bid by E on the other table, she bided 3NT with JXX and it was on the money|pg||
nt|lestergold: now this dangerous intervention by south may prove lucky for n/s making it almost impossible for east to bid no trumps|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 4 sp is normal, but beatable on h lead|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: needs to drop Qx@h offside|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm perhaps an underbid from west but certainly an overbid gtom east|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 2sp was 6c and 9-11hp|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Solution: Drop a card on the floor, and get a good look|pg||
nt|lestergold: wont succeed unless neck very long|pg||
nt|yuval10: ok, i might be wrong, though :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Johnny|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzqy: it was 2h by south|pg||
nt|petergill: A trusting 3@H call, trusting partner to have a good suit to enter the auction vulnerable at the 2-level|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite a weird bidding, by both rooms|pg||
nt|hedyg: well i must admit i do not understand the 4@H bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes bt is the hand he expected|pg||
nt|hedyg: she could have bid double instead of 3@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: but|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is that a cue bid?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think W is worth a 4@c bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: for me yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think it should be, Bill|pg||
nt|daman: 4@C has to be a cue I would think|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So you don't get dealt xx-xx-xx-KQJxxxx|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi all, back from Poland :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: the lead hasnt hurt|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: Sometimes yes, but then I must bid 3@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: i bid 3@s over 3@H with that|pg||
nt|daman: I wouldn't bid 4@C with that|pg||
nt|bjacobs: nice|pg||
nt|henryb: and what would you bid with x xx Qx KJ109xxxx?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: north then too strong for 2s in thie system|pg||
nt|hedyg: the few hcps he has are in his pd's short suits|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Rob, welcome|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi Rob|pg||
nt|yuval10: East doesn't have ANY points in P's suit, looks to me that 3@h is an overbid, not to mention 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/league/division.php?action=view&id=2255  for the tournament website with results, standing and other tidbits|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi|pg||
nt|lestergold: an overtrick may emerge|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: when pd shows 2 suits why bother him with mine?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: West's 3@H showed Values probably|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4d a simple case of findiing qd|pg||
nt|thegarve:  it meshes well NS need to lead @h else EW are a tempo ahead in 4@s|pg||
nt|wygbe1: h shift after the first trump also good enough|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: I would be feeling sick and leave the room, Henry|pg||
pc|c8|nt|yuval10: ok, then after winning K@s, declarer should play K@c|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Roland :)|pg||
nt|wygbe1: pretty easy h shift for south here|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yuval10: or @c to the K now|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|petergill: Pretty normal to bid to 4@H, just unlucky that there are 4 losers - that's my opinion|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|daman: Meck would bid a confident 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, I would have pre-empted in clubs long time ago|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I happen to think that 4@C should be natural|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep 3n+1|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|yuval10: but it has the disadvatage that the defense can find the @d ruff|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, it's a calculated risk|pg||

pc|s7|nt|yuval10: as declarer needs to ruff the @h, he'll go for the drop and make his contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe south thought thatthe long heart would get rid of spade loser but with the clubs staring at him in dummy there was no chance of that|pg||
pc|s9|nt|daman: no kidding|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, if you have a natural club bid available (rather than 1NT), then the cue makes sense|pg||

mb|2S|nt|wygbe1: do they use a range-finder?|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: The next World Junior Pairs is in Turkey in August - don't miss it if you're under 25|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 8+ denying a 5-card major and 6-card minor|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 5@D looks a very good result in the other room|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In the CR, N/S established a missing key card and missing spade queen ... the joys of RKCB|pg||
nt|hedyg: anybody open 1@H in 3rd?|pg||
nt|lestergold: in the closed e/w got rathe rhigh but surprisingly let off withou a double|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: Yes, they use 2@C for that|pg||
nt|thegarve:  playble if it denies 4M|pg||
pc|d5|nt|henryb: mind you, 6@h is less than 50%, so you do not want to be there|pg||
nt|lestergold: same again|pg||
nt|thegarve:  its a decison whethere 3H is encouraging and to use 2NT as lebensohl|pg||
nt|lestergold: well you have to double with the south hand|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hedyg: i am trying to guess how they made 5@d..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, maybe it's too good for me|pg||
nt|henryb: Okay; I do not want to be there. It requires guessing spades and favorable breaks in both majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess Henry means 6@S. Not even I would want to be in 6@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|daman: and that is saying something|pg||
nt|henryb: no; I meant 6@h on the previous hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh that one|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yesterday's news|pg||
nt|daman: Roland would always be in 6@H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But strangely, the <50% applies here as well.  Maybe it's around 40%|pg||
nt|daman: needs 5 of 6 things to be right|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s unlikely to make but 3c makes cards lie very badly for n/s|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW on the other table did well in defeating this contract 2 down...with @c lead from W declarer has 6 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d=12-16 BAL (depend on vul) or 11-16 and 4441 or 11-16 4+@D may have longer @cs|pg||
nt|lestergold: most leads help declarer|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yuval10: no thx|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No reason to do anything holding both majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So they play Astro, hearts and another. Still, it is not brain surgery to figure out that partner's second suit is spades. West's hand is worth close to nothing unless played in ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: clubs|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yuval10: and some good options for 7th... like T@s|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@s has a play|pg||
nt|daman: nice lead in any event|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H showed 4+@s, 1@s showed 3@ss|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like declarer can make 8 tricks here..he'll discard a @s and a @d from dummy, and @s from hand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: ok, 1@c 17+ any, 1@H= 8+balanced or unbalanced with 5-4 minors|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|yuval10: then play AK@c and T@c to establish the suit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: very well play by Jansson|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg: played*|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: 6@C is better than 6@S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One of these blind luck swings|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: now you can run the @s to the  on the way back.|pg||
nt|yuval10: @s to K, @d to Q, and @d ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: so one dim one club 2 spades 2 hearts thats 6 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: now @c and read the position in defense|pg||
nt|lestergold: where is 7th coming from?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: 2@H looks easier certainly |pg||
nt|petergill: I think cashing @Ca could have been left until later|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3 tricks easier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/WomensTeams/Sweden/rimstedt-sjoberg.pdf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks to Carina Westlin|pg||
nt|bjacobs: She might run this lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If it works, she has 12 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although she doesn't have to on this spade layout|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If it fails, she looks to be finished|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C by South is the best slam if you want to be in slam that is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the last match today; play will resume at 9.00 local time, 8 am London, 5 pm Sydney, in the middle of the night in North America|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2 or 3 in a minimum balanced hand|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: i cant see how declarer can avoid the loss of 2c 2s and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|yuval10: he probably won't risk @d finesse though, and will settle for 7|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mtvesuvius: -1 now|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence can make 3c and 3dims now and that will leave declarer a trick short wont be able to establish a seventh trick|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: 4h i dont see the extra values to justify it|pg||
nt|lestergold: partner promuised zilch|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: providing they get clubs right|pg||
nt|mariner1: the problem with this treatment is that it exposes the better hand in a usually tough|pg||
nt|mariner1: contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: on the other room yes, here i think 4@h by East is justified|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|hedyg: open "movie" and click the other table to see the play|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mtvesuvius: small trump return makes this -2 now|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course with the club avalanche in no trumps 2s a better spot than 1N|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
nt|yuval10: wow|pg||
nt|lestergold: misere cover|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|petergill: His aim is to make at least 8 tricks in 2@H, so possble spade overruffs could be afforded, |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Quite a tough psychological decision ... in theory, running the lead was the percentage play ... but how likely was the lead to be from the king?|pg||
nt|hedyg: thinking to finesse H10x in @S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's an ugly card - it means that she is going to have to play the second spade whilst a trump is outstanding|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's making the all-or-nothing finesse at trick 1 look better and better|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: would you assume opp led from K@H vs slam?|pg||
nt|wygbe1: for a while several years ago, a 10-18 no trump was used by some, with a 3-way range finder,  in match point events here - then the acbl outlawed it|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bjacobs: Depends on the opp, I guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Against someone rating themselves "world class" on BBO, I would bet they DON'T have the king|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: and small @s|pg||
nt|yuval10: and NOW she has a timing even for +1 if she plays @s towards the 9|pg||
nt|yuval10: and she does|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bjacobs: But someone rating themselves "Advanced" - play him for the king|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: unlucky hand, but probably -3|pg||
nt|hedyg: wd|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c5|nt|yuval10: might be -3 now|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: since he will lead a @H to the Queen...|pg||
nt|po-s: silly H discard|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|petergill: Trump control is an issue for declarer now, due to @Ca being cashed early|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bjacobs: My theory is that World Class players don't know what they are doing|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, she could not go wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Correction. There is one more match tonight|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer in control|pg||
nt|hedyg: he will make his 2 trumps|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: In 1 hour and 5 minutes|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: Trump control is a tricky aspect of card play to understand fully, but all the world's very best players have a good grasp of it|pg||
nt|daman: that's called "winning ugly"|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: coulda been -1 there with the favorable @c spots|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 1 @D as well|pg||

pc|h8|nt|petergill: Yes Hedy, that is a possible way to bid it, if that's your agreement. Probably not their agreement here, or else she could have bid it|pg||

pc|c4|nt|hedyg: she probably thought 2@H had shown her hand already|pg||
nt|lestergold: does south know that the double shows a void??|pg||
pc|c9|nt|yuval10: North went for an extra overtrick here|pg||
nt|yuval10: not bad, when she knows she can't lose more than 3 @h's|pg||

nt|mariner1: Amazing grace! How sweet the sound|pg||

nt|yuval10: if he bids 3@c i guess NS will find themself in 5@c very quickly|pg||
nt|wygbe1: then declarer gave it back by not playing the good club when the only trump out was the ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed I have Martin|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You don't want to see it|pg||
nt|thegarve:  please name and shame|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry hedy saturday afternoon kitchen nightmare site|pg||
nt|hedyg: she must feel terrible :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: trick compression is an "Art" with some of us :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mtvesuvius: and once again West keeps on bidding north's suits|pg||
nt|daman: so it is|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|petergill: South has a lot of catching up to do, to show her hand|pg||
nt|pocken: With a standard treatment of a 2H jump shift, 1C!  - 1H! - 1NT - 3Sp! would do the trick|pg||
nt|yuval10: and N keeps bidding NT...|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry its a bridge nightmare site not a kitchen nightmare site |pg||
nt|lestergold: whats going on here|pg||
nt|lestergold: fun iondeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only Top 5 for now. 1-2: PO Sundelin, Barnet Shenkin - 3-4: Andrew Robson, Glenn Grøtheim - 5: Bauke Muller|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|lestergold: west's turn to be carted off to the bridge prison|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H= 10-13|pg||
nt|lestergold: for a vulnerable overcall in suchsa dangeropus position i think two consecuitive life sentences|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s should reach 3n here which has good chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@C is a bit conservative|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the 1 opening didnt do justice to it|pg||
nt|lestergold: ew for e/wis enormous|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think this 1NT is as bad as the previous one|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s for e/w enormous|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: tough to find 4@s now|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is gonna hurt|pg||
nt|yuval10: "The babes" are surely gaining ground as the match prograss|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mtvesuvius: this 1NT is just as bad as the last one...|pg||
nt|hedyg: his pd will kill him first, the rest of the team later|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|hedyg: could be worse i guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: funnily enuf north will not actually retire on the penalty|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes found some good cards in E|pg||
nt|lestergold: but west still needs a tuff word from the coach perhaps behind the bike shed|pg||
nt|hedyg: low encouraging|pg||
nt|lestergold: swop the j and 4 of spades and the q and 5 of clubs for example|pg||
nt|hedyg: Johnny?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and u have more bloodshed than in the french reolution|pg||
nt|lestergold: revolution|pg||

nt|vugraphzqy: Sandra is thinking!|pg||
nt|lestergold: west is probably hiding|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhhh ty|pg||
nt|yuval10: @s lead is best of course, but not much indication for West to lead it|pg||
nt|cicus: might easily lose 2 diamond|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he plays the doubkle dim finesse which is probably better odds than ace and another|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: north has to rescue this for her side|pg||
nt|roswolf: no double?|pg||
nt|yuval10: lol they just found it|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland wants to be in 6s which makes i think|pg||

nt|daman: 1@S was canape?|pg||
nt|lestergold: adam do you tyhink the 1n card should be removed from svenson's biddin g box?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: no. I just think he needs to use it less often|pg||
nt|yuval10: lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the entry position may force declarer to get the diamonds right|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: ty Johnny|pg||

mb|p|nt|thegarve:  played Grotheim recently and he held his reputation, but he did defend a few of the hands in tempo|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 2@C followed by 2H was 11-13 6+@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thx Tommy|pg||
pc|cK|nt|daman: Hi Per-Ola|pg||
nt|hedyg: why play 9@s?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  might take a double @d finesse|pg||
nt|thegarve:  the first three do sit there and sit there and sit there|pg||
pc|c9|nt|roswolf: no 5@C - i think south badly mis-evaluated her hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: not obvious to play @d now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bjacobs: This auction has been decoded|pg||
nt|pocken: @S = 16-19 4+|pg||
nt|daman: a spec says.....I think, 1S=4+ can be 5, over 1NT response 2C would be 5+S, 2D/2H canape with 5+ suits and 2S canape with 5+ clubs..|pg||
nt|pocken: 1NT asks|pg||
nt|pocken: 2@C = 5+@S|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to get back to hand for the fourth club|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bjacobs: How old is the N/S pair?|pg||
nt|pocken: 24-26-ish|pg||
nt|daman: Roland's age|pg||

pc|hA|nt|hedyg: not even if added!|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: When I started teaching my younger brother how to play bridge, he became obsessed with opening 1NT. He opened 1NT on any hand that had 11+ HCP in it... This seems to be a similar ...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: case :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: well its only oveertricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite hard to blame E for playing the Ace to prevent probably @h ruffs|pg||
nt|hedyg: squeeze on S or so she thinks|pg||
nt|mariner1: what is the translation of the EW team name?|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||

nt|lestergold: well er em 1100 perhaps a little sad but the bid deserved to be punished in my opinion but apparently not in one or two specs opinions|pg||
nt|cicus: 2 declarers feeling bad|pg||
mb|1H|nt|daman: Roland has seen a third generation of trees|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Because this gives them exposure to many common tactical situations|pg||
nt|Walddk3: N-S are very experienced, E-W are not, so please bear with them|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: true but there are hands that qualify and therefore i try to cater for them|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: nice slam here, but it must be played in @c|pg||
nt|lestergold: well anothyer corker|pg||
nt|Walddk3: That was how we all learned the game, the hard way|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm could be trouble here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Whereas playing obscure big club methods, you lose that experience|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s now?|pg||
nt|yuval10: a bit pessimistic approach by E IMO|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6c for e/w with a 6s good save available|pg||
nt|hedyg: you all pass in W?|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards spitting here at e/w|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: im still learning it Roland the hard way|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I do|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@d = 9-11 ?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: this hand is close to slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: east must surely bid 4s over 3s!|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, East was a bit pessimistic, but it does require partner to have the K@h|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: otherwise it's not a very good slam to be in|pg||
nt|lestergold: or heart finesse also|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL we all are|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes I do,,,,,,,|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: join the club|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: yes|pg||
nt|yuval10: at least that what it was previously :)|pg||
nt|cicus: should be a raise, it was for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w havr  stayed fortuiously low...... so far|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yuval10: 4@s is better because it can also create a force and help the partnership in this particular situation when opps bid 5@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'll preserve my right to remain silent.... :P|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|daman: moi aussi|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice stop by East, might be tempting to bid some more|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|pocken: sorry answered E-W age, N is even younger, and played for a looong time, so sure she tried natural system|pg||
nt|bjacobs: sorry, |pg||
nt|lestergold: south may have been tempted to dip[ his oar in the water|pg||
nt|thegarve:  should compete with 2@h pass is sleepy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/q7l6em  for running scores in all matches|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: as a spec suggests 6@C looks good|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: well, that's one way to bid it|pg||
nt|lestergold: doesnt cost to bid 4s then west with good clubs and an outside high card may get the message|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: double is a bridge gaol offence|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mtvesuvius: 4@s is definitely right though|pg||
nt|yuval10: 13 tricks comming EW's way now|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|hedyg: more than close?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|nt|mtvesuvius: and now a double my Melin based on his "2@s tricks"|pg||
nt|hedyg: can they find the grand on a finesse?|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice lead by N|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: his hand is nmegative value in defence lucfky that his spade would stand if pard led it|pg||
nt|lestergold: if southc doubles for takeout north bids 3c then east bids 3s and that gets whacked|pg||
nt|lestergold: south shopuld probably put some pressure on especially not vul he can stand playing in 3 denominations|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok, just the slam|pg||
nt|mariner1: well no entries to dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Iceland Juniors 13 VPs clear at this point|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: yes not in @H, in @c|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bjacobs: I am told North about 21-22|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: i cannot understand how n/s stayed in a part score in the closed room|pg||
nt|lestergold: and only managed to make 5 as spec points out|pg||
nt|yuval10: personally, i hate to TO double with void|pg||
nt|cicus: many hate but voids keep coming|pg||
nt|Walddk2: from Filips fanclub|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|yuval10: unless E tries a @s now|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s3|nt|Walddk3: Because they are young and inexperienced, and because they are on vugraph for the first time in their lives|pg||
nt|yuval10: which he doesn't|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: He needs to pass, which should be suggesting a save|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yuval10: many times Partner will leave it with 4 cards and let them play in the 2 level with 9 cards is just horrible|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|lestergold: Melin joins the convict parade|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i do not like letting opps play in 2 level suit contracts if i can do anything about it|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pocken: Petersen knew they had a 8+ minor suit fit, however, all depends on partner´s @S-holding|pg||
pc|sT|nt|roswolf: well you need to be objective and it does need a 3-2 break in trumps + other non-bad breaks|pg||
nt|lestergold: the meat wagon is filling up|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Doubling for the fun of it is not good...|pg||
nt|yuval10: a much-needed swing for "the babes"|pg||
nt|lestergold: but it only involves cashing ticks ruffing losers taking finesses Roland- |pg||
nt|Walddk3: Then you can have a debate as to whether they should have been on vugraph at all, but that's the decision of the organisers, not us. And we fully respect the decision they make|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mtvesuvius: yes, brings the match much closer.|pg||
nt|yuval10: the X only cost 3 imps|pg||
nt|yuval10: for itself, that is|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: True, but partner may have saved over 6@c|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: the double is telling partner not to same|pg||
nt|lestergold: as i originally suggested|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: save*|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes, excluding the fact that they might have find the save|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Correct|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course they should be on vu-graph|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Full stop.|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: you would!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Specs demanding a webcam|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not really on a sane bidding sequence|pg||
nt|thegarve:  4th highest longest and strongest|pg||
nt|wygbe1: this could be interesting - will they play it in 3n? yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bech wanted to shut out the majors I suppose|pg||
nt|wygbe1: now will n lead h?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did, but ....|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 3n = partner will bid pass|pg||
nt|wygbe1: there is a lot to be said for the heart ace on this auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cashing @HA seems normal against a gambling 3NT, although it should have side values in 3rd seat|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|lestergold: push coffee hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4th seat even|pg||
nt|thegarve:  now that lead is poor|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yuval10: Filip's fanclub, the leaders before this round, is losing 22:8 to "Ida" team, and therefor are heading for 3rd place|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bjacobs: Yeah, I reckon those Viktor players are pretty good looking|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C by South is obviously a super contract|pg||

nt|hedyg: tell them to check the movie of the other room|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|lestergold: have I spoken too soon?|pg||

pc|cA|nt|mtvesuvius: 3@c probably showed 1 of the top 3 club honors|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: spade*|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: soutyh cant be tyhat chuffed with his collection|pg||
nt|po-s: apparently Asplund doesn´t know who is on lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 13 more IMPs to Iceland Juniors|pg||
mc|13|nt|daman: the coach needs to speak to him|pg||
nt|cicus: I can see no sensible way to it either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Make that 12|pg||

pc|h2|nt|hedyg: 3NT a bit pessimistic|pg||

nt|hedyg: mini NT |pg||
nt|daman: yep   Gavin is a fellow Canadian|pg||
nt|yuval10: i guess 2@s by N = 3(+) cards|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: 2@c was ?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And a minimal sort of result for N/S|pg||
nt|daman: SOS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Malmölaget = The Team from Malmö (Sweden's 3rd largest city after Stockholm and Göteborg)|pg||
nt|hedyg: denying a 5 card suit i assume|pg||
nt|hedyg: and @H stopper?|pg||
nt|yuval10: hence South's 3@s bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h indeed loses 2 tricks in each suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: i guess N is not happy with her @c stopper, thus no raise|pg||
nt|yuval10: very nice X|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 2hx is not abad save againsgt a n/s game albei a dodgy game|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: an overtrick or two maybe forthcoming|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: 2 and 3@d seems to have been forcing|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially with the dim switch|pg||
nt|lestergold: but nothing terribly attracive for west to play |pg||
nt|lestergold: best hope mfiding qd with [pard|pg||
nt|yuval10: W played in the Swedish team for the "white house" tournement, that did very well by finishing 3rd |pg||
nt|Walddk2: The babe is playing in the other room, Maria Helin|pg||
nt|yuval10: both East and West played several times in the Swedish juniors/schools teams in many occasions|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tre hunkar = three cool guys|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petergill: Without @C10, 6NT would be a poor contract. Even as the cards lie, a declarer in 6NT might fail by taking the @D finesse. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hunkar stolen from English 'hunk'|pg||
nt|lestergold: the name of that team sounds like the title of a certain kind of movie|pg||
nt|Walddk2: pronounced hoonkar|pg||
nt|yuval10: they're very creative as far as team's names are concern :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like this contract is going down a lot|pg||
nt|hedyg: a good time to play @C|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: but W could have 4+ @cs and it might be enough for 6 @Cs?|pg||
nt|yuval10: as a spec pointed out|pg||
nt|hedyg: wont need the squeeze now|pg||
nt|yuval10: but indeed, he won't need that now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|daman: this will be painful|pg||

pc|hQ|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Great team name|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Malmölaget had a 25-4 VP win in round 1, Filips Fanclub a bye|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|petergill: East might have bid 3@C, to look for 6@C. |pg||

pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Geoffrey Wolfarth|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Noting that E/W had good methods to ensure they could get the penalty (strength showing double of 1NT, takeout doubles)|pg||
nt|hedyg: CR has not started play yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: a hunk was mentioned in Cliff Richard's 'Living Doll'. You remember Mike?|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: First comment, also hard to be subtle :)|pg||
nt|petergill: They are twins, aged about 13|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|roswolf: lol|pg||

nt|yuval10: East is the father of Filip - the baby which the previous team we saw on VUgraph, "Filip's fanclub" , has taken the idea for it's name from|pg||
nt|lestergold: a good junior 4s here for e/w|pg||
nt|hedyg: interesting 1@s, no 2suiter bid|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hedyg: Johnny pls undo|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: Well, this now looks like they are playing a strong club or something...|pg||
nt|lestergold: work to do but looks hopeful|pg||
nt|yuval10: North decided not to bid 2-suiter, i agree with her, as my personal style for 2-suiter bid is sub-opening or 17+|pg||
nt|cicus: @D+M, I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4@hX-2 500|pg||
mb|2N|nt|hedyg: 2@H by E|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@c stayman|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: far more likely|pg||
nt|yuval10: over 1@s|pg||
nt|cicus: oh, Astro|pg||
nt|lestergold: no harm done 3d makes|pg||
nt|thegarve:  with my physique I was never called a hunk|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Are Ola and Mikael Rimstedt twins?|pg||
nt|hedyg: XX would probably show @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: So Karlsson is in 4@HX. |pg||
nt|petergill: Care required in the defence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hit the UNDO button a few times and start all over again please|pg||
nt|hedyg: if they play transfers over X|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The hand is easy to play after East's (normal) take-out double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even without the heart lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@H has become a very useful card|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: maybe better wonder what 1@d means|pg||
nt|yuval10: wow....|pg||
nt|hedyg: the 1@c opening was alerted last hand|pg||

nt|yuval10: so she elects the 1NT 15-17 bid, even though she has only 14|pg||
nt|cicus: 4+@S and another 4+, if @H, @H better or longer, I am told|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Good morning|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Martin Garvey|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Both pairs strong club|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petergill: As long as Sotuh never leads @CA, 4@HX fails by at least one trick|pg||
nt|daman: no less than 9 tricks  maybe 10 if they pick up the @Hs for 4 winners|pg||
nt|yuval10: a lot of international experience shared by those 2 pairs, which represent Sweden in many juniors events|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: yes, only pre-empt once|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 losers only but have to establish ten winners|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u needs two ntries to dumm to take club finesse twice maybe not so easy|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|hedyg: usually once you open a weak 2 you have bid your hand|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: sorry he didnt even have a void heart|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|yuval10: this hand implicate the advatages of a strong @c opening over the natural system... whereas in most of the natural systems it would go 1@c - 1@h - 2NT - P |pg||
