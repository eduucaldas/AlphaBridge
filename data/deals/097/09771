nt|lestergold: wow|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: What a fun hand|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4NT opening is best with the North hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: good hand for 4NT opening |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Specific Ace Asking|pg||
nt|yuval10: asking for specific aces|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And partner has two aces, but not the right one|pg||
nt|hedyg: you do?|pg||
nt|daman: Canadian ears|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why team-name Iceland Juniors I am asked. Because that team won the Nordic Junior Championships in Iceland recently|pg||
nt|yuval10: wow|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if north got that right it would have been seriously impressive|pg||
nt|cicus: nice shapes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our first comparison is due|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: north has an old fashioned 4n opener if people still play that|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Old fashioned?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  two huge double fits and @s is the boss suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: the babe or the cards?|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|hedyg: 1NT is a good option with the N hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h X is a very good result for DBK|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: great result for the "juniors" from the other table, as 6@h is cold|pg||
nt|cicus: hehe|pg||
nt|minimonkey: When I start saying too many silly things ill give alex a call and get him out of bed to replace me :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: whom can i call?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 2NT= Weak with both minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: n/s should find their heart game|pg||
nt|yuval10: whereas 5@d is , at the very least, a good sacrifice|pg||
nt|hedyg: should reach it quickly now|pg||
nt|yuval10: surely X now from W|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@H is on|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is a normal contract, but I don't think it can make |pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: well i play it so it must be|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 3h overcall by S is arguably too good a hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@H Dbl 3@H or 2@H Passl 3@H is not an invitation, the opener is expected, or even demanded, not to bid again|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Passing the East hand is losing bridge|pg||
nt|daman: no kidding|pg||
nt|hedyg: i agree Mike|pg||
nt|daman: NS did well in the CR to get to 4@H and make|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like NS will stay out of game here|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow 11-16 is quite a range|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: bad @H suit and get the strength across|pg||
nt|roswolf: the elephants in the other room survived with a plus score at least|pg||
nt|hedyg: amazing pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is even worse|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|hedyg: and now punish pd for balancing|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: it was gtailor made for this hand|pg||
nt|thegarve:  on this occasion specific suited Michaels would be best|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
nt|ady: cards lay well for e/w    likely to make 3NT     can they bid it?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mtvesuvius: I think 4NT as specific aces isn't old fashioned... and I play it, and it's come up... believe it or not.|pg||
nt|lestergold: east was never having any of that 4h we know that !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Played by West in the other room, and Cecilia Rimstedt got off to the best start for the defence: a club|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yuval10: 4@d now|pg||
nt|lestergold: of clourse it does|pg||
nt|daman: lose 6 IMPs    |pg||
nt|yuval10: this will produce 6 or 7 imps for "the babes", they continue the good start|pg||
nt|minimonkey: W has an interesting decision, nice 4 card support and 2 aces but the 4333 pattern makes things trickyer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tre hunkar = Three cool dudes. Hunkar (pronounced hoonkar) is stolen from English 'hunk'|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@d = 9-11 + support, or @d and GF|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: A bit strong for a 15-17 1NT|pg||
nt|petergill: with all those tens|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree but north in the other room took a pessimistic view|pg||
nt|daman: what dpoes South need to double this one?|pg||
nt|daman: a drink maybe|pg||
nt|thegarve:  two teams have raced away from he field - Iceland Juniors ain Fillps fanclub|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|petergill: Hence the upgrade to 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|hedyg: now a @c lead..|pg||
nt|hedyg: she is happy with the contract|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Not a very good start for NS in the CR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Helin did what you should never do: raised partner's jump to 6@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: so does she , thus rebid|pg||
nt|lestergold: west not learning not to believe partner|pg||
nt|hedyg: W has a normal double|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: west 's double is perfectly understandable|pg||
nt|hedyg: can expect 1 trick from pd who opened|pg||
nt|daman: took a dim view|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Granath will be sleeping on the sofa in the living room tonight, says his girlfriend :)|pg||
nt|daman: and what contract would she not be happy with?|pg||
nt|hedyg: they better cash the @C trick|pg||
nt|hedyg: @s lead in CR|pg||
nt|cicus: so X was a raise|pg||
nt|lestergold: east you must save but pard did it for u|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is that 2@d call that shows 9-11 with fit or @ds|pg||
pc|c8|nt|roswolf: now@CQ|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: If he had been interested in your two aces, he would have asked|pg||
nt|lestergold: still north has many ways of forcing partner to cue the ace of clubs and south didnt so ...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: ok, good stop|pg||
nt|yuval10: and 14 imps|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Must be disappointing for North, but it's a nice auction and a good stop|pg||
nt|lestergold: sounds like a bridge cime was committed in the closed|pg||
nt|daman: thought the babes were the NS team|pg||
nt|yuval10: 11 imps it will be for the "Juniors"|pg||
nt|ady: do not favour that opening   with such weak clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If you are going to play 2NT for the minors, you cannot be choosey ... |pg||
nt|athene: @HA, @SK pitching heart, diamond finesse looks possible|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yuval10: this will create a swing in favour of "the fanclub"|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 2@d was now 9-11 with support with spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: E got carried away opposite 9-11|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: i mean  i know certain players who would open s with north and another few who would think that they should bid 7 with two aces opposite|pg||
nt|yuval10: then it's easy to make 10|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|lestergold: partner does have one trick|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: no George|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|yuval10: one may wonder how only 10 tricks were made on the other table|pg||
nt|hedyg: she might get @s wrong now that she does not know the A@D is in W|pg||
nt|yuval10: it's not like you can misguess @s's|pg||
nt|yuval10: atfer this lead, E will be very happy|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: the ant finds the true path|pg||
nt|yuval10: only need 2-1 spade|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|hedyg: you can|pg||
nt|yuval10: no...they're EW|pg||
nt|daman: ok  gotcha|pg||
pc|dT|nt|daman: i thought erik and karl were men's names|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it's not to be|pg||
nt|hedyg: for a short moment|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzqy: THay not playing much at this table. Couple ot cars then a claim|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Actually, Sandra and Emma will turn 23 and 24 respectively by the end of the month, but I was close|pg||
nt|athene: but declarer did well, playing for heart tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That looked like a practice finesse in hearts - I'm not sure it's going to gain anything at all - 10 tricks either way?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: especially if you play E for AKJ@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: u can play one from hand u mean Hedy!|pg||
nt|yuval10: @c loser is going over the K@d and you only lose 1@d, 1@s and 1@h at most|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: curtains|pg||
pc|s7|nt|petergill: Another contract bites the dust. In youth bridge, many contracts bite the dust (go down). |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Jim Tritt|pg||
nt|athene: playing @HA and @SK does give up a lot of control|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|athene: which might be a problem on a 4-1 trump break|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, maybe he was not too strong for 1NT after all....|pg||
nt|hedyg: they are|pg||
nt|yuval10: hey are, hench they're a "hunkar's" |pg||
pc|d4|nt|wygbe1: hi all|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|yuval10: hence|pg||
nt|athene: south going up like that with @CA does look quite likely to be stiff @CA|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
mc|10|nt|hedyg: wd|pg||
nt|bjacobs: well, maybe|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|rodal f: For visit the turney go at: http://www.abf.com.au/events/anot/. The last segment are up. Welcome all specs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel: Hi all :) |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Andrew Webb|pg||
nt|tejjyid: hi all|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: ahhhh Klinger has switched partners!   earlier sets with Matt Mullamphy|pg||
pc|d8|nt|nigel: Fun stuff Klinger and Lilley were once Australia's premier pair..So bragging rights whoever wins|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so, maybe the answer tothe questions about who has the most partners is Klinger|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|nigel: Klinger Hoffman play in the Seniors, Klinger Mullamphy play open|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well, thisis certainly a Seniors table now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|nigel: Correct....very much so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think either identical system or maybe some lineups switch meaning of artificial 1M-2m auctions|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|nt|nigel: Though age perhaps has sen their games improve!|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: If partner cared about your aces, he would have asked|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry all, she could not misguess of course|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it's very good to play the K anyway... W hardly can have 3 aces|pg||
nt|daman: too complicated    just get a client and use their name like we do on this side of the pond|pg||
nt|yuval10: Both south players, here and on the other table, are girls|pg||
nt|hedyg: junior client?|pg||
nt|daman: sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: they are in a hurry?|pg||
nt|yuval10: they need to take care of Filip|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|minimonkey: Thats a pretty looking 10 count east has, i suspect it will be opened|pg||
nt|ady: e/w    will lose 3 imps  here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: I do not see why east bid 5d over 4h|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 4h looks iffy, but makeable|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hedyg: how about playing bridge for fun, honour and fame?|pg||
nt|hedyg: as it should be|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: or even slightly better than that|pg||
nt|hedyg: even!|pg||
nt|petergill: Vulnerable games at IMPS should be about 35% chance to be worth bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: in front of partner|pg||
nt|daman: might be a dounle partscore swing on this|pg||
nt|daman: double*|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|yuval10: North did well with his distributional hand , so now he gets another one|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|Walddk2: Another normal game. Has a better chance if played by East|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i thought 40%|pg||
nt|lestergold: Adam you are right o course you are but players often go wrong with these hands|pg||
nt|hedyg: he likes to bid a lot|pg||
nt|daman: EW are on for 3@D|pg||
nt|thegarve:  surprising to give up to 5@S at the other table|pg||
nt|wygbe1: entries are a problem though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Arvidsson has a maximum for his 2@C|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|petergill: OK|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah i cee Hedy|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: my partners always bid 2@d..|pg||
nt|yuval10: mine too|pg||
nt|yuval10: correction - 3@d|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS have a lot of experience already in playing national and international competitions|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Passing 2@C would not cross my mind|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i dont think this is going to be a success|pg||
nt|yuval10: normal auction|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT on fir n/s  as long as e/w can take 5 heart tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i will try 35%..|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 1@h promises 3@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think South has a X here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2h high enuf on these cards|pg||
nt|lestergold: vulnerable south cant safely back into this|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5c has play but north may have tried 3h which says bid 3n if u have a heart guard to pard|pg||
nt|wygbe1: that lead blew the whole heart suit as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm not a good double but hard to pass even if not a junior|pg||
nt|hedyg: i trust you Peter|pg||
nt|petergill: @D7 or @Dq back as suit pref to show @HK?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hed like to double |pg||
nt|lestergold: roland is in slam here|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is the one to bid a lot if you will play AK@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: sorry specs; we don't have E-W's CC, so we can't tell what 1@S is|pg||
nt|lestergold: its the rubberneck slam|pg||
nt|wygbe1: low club works well here|pg||
nt|thegarve:  should make 10 tricks picking up the @h suit|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: has play? it's infrangible as you used to say|pg||
nt|lestergold: if they play that|pg||
nt|yuval10: same lead, probably same result|pg||
nt|yuval10: defense can cause troubles to declarer if N will return @c now|pg||
nt|athene: nine tricks here whether or not west leads from @HAxxx, i would guess|pg||
nt|ady: thats a good proposition for n/s  with QXX  opposite 10XX|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: restrained 3@s bid|pg||
nt|petergill: even at the expense of wasting the Beer Card|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|yuval10: too easy for Roland|pg||
nt|minimonkey: Both N and S unwilling to stick their necks out at this vulnerability, the fact that EW dont have to have a spade fit here adds to the danger|pg||
nt|ady: got the worst lead   but still ok|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|hedyg: nor 1@c..|pg||
nt|thegarve:  lest see if he makes 12 |pg||
nt|yuval10: and she does|pg||
nt|athene: east can put her partner with the @HA and hence nothing else |pg||
nt|ady: just the formality for playing a top diamond from the south hand to guard against 5 to the  ten|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/q7l6em  for running scores in all matches|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like a sort of a "raptor 1NT" on the other table|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|hedyg: ok lets guess, strong @c, 1@s 8+ with @hs, 2@c checkback, 3NT= i was not interested in your 4 @ss..|pg||
nt|daman: all roads led to 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: at unfavourable i think risk outweighs gain with tah hand|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1NT there was probably 4 cards @h and 5+ cards minor|pg||
nt|thegarve:  playing @c reduces that to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Filips need to win by 23-7 VPs or more to overtake Iceland Juniors|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yuval10: and now, when S plays another @c, it's quite reasonable for declarer to ruff with the K and finesse to the T@s|pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: yes very disciplined but prudent since north was under pressure and ,as here,may have to stretch to find a bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: do EW have a chance at 4@H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i guess not on a @c lead|pg||
pc|d4|nt|daman: there are 4 losers unless NS fail to cash their @Ds|pg||
nt|lestergold: at mps i agree|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|yuval10: so it was easy for N to bid 2@h with 4 cards support|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cicus: there is a @D guess but will get that right I believe|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 9@s|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: Tough ask but not impossible|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: South might have played @D10 at Trick 1 to disguise the @d position, but East has played W for @DK109 anyway|pg||
nt|hedyg: she needs to play @s from dummy to get rid of the @c losers|pg||
nt|cicus: I mean for 6|pg||
nt|thegarve:  ahh mike's panted word - infrangible|pg||
nt|yuval10: i believe that means -2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Not much else Sjöberg can play when in with @SJ|pg||
nt|minimonkey: The 2@d is a good play by Rinstedt, making sure that her partner can get on lead to play a club through|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|daman: trop tarde|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Olofsson's reasoning for passing the take-out double must have been "Even if it makes, it is not game". Wrong philosophy in my opinion. Too weak to pass. Natural 2@D response|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|thegarve:  patented|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S in 3@H next door|pg||
nt|yuval10: he avoided the ruff, so it's only -1|pg||
nt|hedyg: no big deal since NS can make 3@h with careful play|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: i want my commisions please|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: finesse is for chickens? real men play AK?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like making on the nose|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hedyg: that would be 2@d and 1@s loser only|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: J@C?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: 29+ IMPs|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: could try that before @c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/q7l6em  for running scores in all matches|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: Not really|pg||
nt|daman: then declarer can pitch 2@Cs on the @Ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: would be for free|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: since partner (West) had natural trump tricks, missing the ruff did not cost|pg||
nt|daman: and wuldn't have to lose a @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: exactly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/league/division.php?action=view&id=2255  for the tournament website with results, standing and other tidbits|pg||

nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel: How times have changed what a dreadful opening!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|nigel: regardless of the outcome|pg||
nt|rodal f: But was worce. Lilly had a lead at 58 by the best. Last session was a 3 in for Lilly after Del Montte was 10 behind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my opinion - Lilley team has been steadier -- actually picking up many imps for staying low / being less active in competition|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel: Some would call that just sound good bridge|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: yep - they have plyed old fashioned bridge & been rewarded for it|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|tejjyid: it doesn't have to be good, it just has to be better|pg||

nt|Walddk2: When a doubled contract makes two overtricks, you know you have made a poor judgement. But they are young and they will learn, the hard way like the rest of us|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Closed room still not done with 19, but it's a rather boring 3NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A tricky 3NT |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like a 3NT like this. 9 top tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6 diamonds, 3 aces|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So even I would be able to make it on a good day|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But can you bid it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I guess the 3@C bid sort of levers you into it|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|petergill: Bd 2: I think North having @H7 might stop 4@h by EW|pg||

nt|hedyg: Open one browser window per table|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: hm another mistake in the closed slam off two tops|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland loves em because they so often produce swings|pg||
mb|4C|nt|roswolf: straightforward hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: this isa dull looking one|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10-12|pg||
nt|athene: what about if N-S sac in 4@C?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Can you bid it now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can't bid it now :(|pg||
nt|athene: now you have a bit more of a problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: oooops 9-12|pg||
nt|hedyg: double is penalty|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 11-16, wow, what a range|pg||
nt|po-s: så hur gick det|pg||
nt|Walddk2: bra|pg||
nt|lestergold: have to be very unlucky to go off here in 4h|pg||
nt|cicus: beg your pardon?|pg||
nt|athene: east is surely worth 4@D over 4@C?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D is a loser though|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 23 pts 3NT  for e/w     but with fitting 6 card diamond suit    should be reached with strong no-trump and acceptance of minor suit transfer to diamonds|pg||
mb|d|nt|daman: 2@C might be modified capp?|pg||
nt|daman: either @Ds  or a major/minor 2 suiter? |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Cappelletti over partner's 1NT?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yuck. looking for slam after partner couldn't cuebid @c...|pg||
nt|lestergold: these slam level errors are very expensive|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes amazing|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Not sure how they control that|pg||
nt|daman: with great skill|pg||
nt|hedyg: well maybe it is 11-13 NV and 14-16 vuln?|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like -2 here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c gf relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: slam exploration is legitimate here but the club hole should easily be identified|pg||
nt|Walddk2: PO asked how it went|pg||
nt|minimonkey: 2H= 4 in the Other major, in this case spades|pg||
mb|4D|nt|daman: mod capp rescue over the double|pg||
nt|daman: I play that with weak NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: we talked earlier about not asking RKCB with a void, now we can see why asking RKCB with 2 quick losers in a suit is wrong, too|pg||
nt|hedyg: W could have passed|pg||
nt|yuval10: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: that's why they invented cue-bids|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: exactly, especially when partner had the chance to cuebid it|pg||
nt|wygbe1: reaching 6c on this one was pretty ambitious|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H  8+  no 5-card major, no 6-card minor|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 1h a trans, probly|pg||
nt|ady: south however has an acxceptable pre-empt in clubs    |pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: now North shouldn't even explore|pg||
nt|hedyg: X over the mini NT is penalty|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2 matches ago, Sandra's 3rd hand 1NT led to -800 for their side|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4@C was a real winner ... not sure I would have found it|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Bd 2 in 4@H: Three rounds of clubs to stop the @d's being set up in time, then declarer tries to crossruff, but I think 4@H fails. |pg||
nt|daman: 2@C would be modified capp|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't know that Mike Cappelletti would allow his name to be used in that context|pg||
nt|daman: he does|pg||
nt|hedyg: i take that back, last time he had 14 nv|pg||
nt|po-s: did he guess D?|pg||
nt|athene: east has bid as though she has nothing - surely she had to do more|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: 2NT jacoby with 3 cards?|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C = any minimum|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: i suppose the problem is that you play for qh to drop then u have tio fall back on finding qd and tyhere wont be a lot of info to get from the defenders|pg||
nt|hedyg: tough lead for W|pg||
nt|minimonkey: I think you lead a diamond and be unhappy about it|pg||
nt|athene: even if this has worked out better than an aggressive course of action|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: miscounted not 20/20 19/21|pg||
nt|yuval10: another good result for the "Iceland juniors" team...looks like declarer misguessed @d's on the other room|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Roland would make 6@c|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i see|pg||
nt|yuval10: so, 11 tricks are likely now|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, Swedish Jacoby|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, Phantom City |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am looking forward to watching our next match (in about 1 hour and 5 minutes). Viktor vs Tre hunkar o en babe (Three cool dudes and a babe). Interesting team name!|pg||
nt|lestergold: adn they are listening to you adam|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: well bided , and 10 more imps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Agreed Bill, I wouldn't have bid 4@C either when looking at 4-4 in the majors|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: Lunch break after this match. Restart at 12.50 local time, in 1 hour and 40 minutes|pg||
nt|minimonkey: And now having cashed the ace W still has a lead problem|pg||
nt|hedyg: he wanted to see dummy..|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's right ... you think, hmm, I don't mind defending a major here|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: 2c looks like making |pg||
nt|hedyg: well another 1 cost them a lot|pg||
nt|lestergold: so not much of a swing here|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petergill: I slightly prefer Swedish Jacoby to American Jacoby|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes they bided their tiem i agree|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Nice stop. 10 more imps to Victor...|pg||
nt|lestergold: bad yoke|pg||
nt|lestergold: I would like a tame hand now please so i can make a coffee|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hedyg: because?|pg||
nt|yuval10: If Filip's fanclub loses here by the score of 12:18, the "Iceland Juniors" team will be the champions even before their last match|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Even when the opponents reach 3NT, you have good hopes of a set|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Not sure of the continuation, but I know they are in the right contract|pg||
nt|thegarve:  I play this 1H method in a strong @c system, 1NT =  min bal say 18-20 and 1@S is a relay, extras balanced on semi-blanced or 5M|pg||
pc|d5|nt|thegarve:  2H/S would show 6M|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: oh......|pg||
nt|lestergold: only info will be west showing out now in hearts thus making it fractionally more likely that he holds qd|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hedyg: where Rimstedt ended playing 2@c X and made 3 tricks i think|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yuval10: yes that was the one i was talking about Hedy|pg||
nt|yuval10: it was corrected to -4|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh ok, sry|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|yuval10: "only"  -800|pg||
nt|athene: yes but 4@C might push them into 4major|pg||
nt|athene: which you want to do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So this is a swing the 'wrong' way so to speak|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg: why not just play @s?|pg||
nt|cicus: as E will be known to hold @SA+@HQ+@CK west will be more likely to hold @DQ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: a spade return may have beaten this|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hedyg: only? it was scored as 1100|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is true too|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Filips need the swings, not Iceland Juniors|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: so i lay money on this being flat|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  reached in closed room  after samed 3@C opening and double. but then pass and 3@D    then 3NT     but 3NT was very much a gamble    partner wont alweays have 6 diamonds to the ...|pg||
nt|ady: ace|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yuval10: as i said, it was corrected later to -800|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: if n/s can get a spade ruff in as well as enjoy their two dim tricks im not sure declarer should have played the qd on oppening lead|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|daman: the coach for NS just informed me 2@C showed a major/minor 2 suiter    so....I guess they play modified capp in Sweden|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yuval10: looks like West was sure that East has a singel @s ...but it doesn't matter as K@s + @s establish the suit anyway...|pg||
nt|thegarve:  will play on @s to get one final clue|pg||
nt|lestergold: another round or two of discovery plays now which wont discover what he wants to know unfortuantel|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: where did south think they were finding 6 tricks from?|pg||
nt|hedyg: exactly|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 3n could actually have gone down, but the heart lead will make the 9th trick easy|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|petergill: In American Jacoby, opener has to show his singleton straightaway even on hands where only 4M will be reached, which can help the defence. |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok i see your point|pg||
nt|hedyg: but it does help responder evaluate his honours|pg||
mc|11|nt|daman: as a resce|pg||
nt|daman: rescue|pg||
nt|lestergold: east anxious to show off all his high cards maybe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He had no choice|pg||
nt|lestergold: mayeb south might suspect a deliberate bluff|pg||
pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@S=8-11, 5+@S no shortage|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: enjoy Nigel|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: does that mean a different proctologist each week?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|tejjyid: I might rather X 2@S than bid 3H on an untextured 5 card suit|pg||

nt|tejjyid: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: If Ron bid now there are no sakrifice. But got it anyway|pg||

nt|lestergold: minors v majors|pg||
nt|daman: they have to hunkar down with their defense|pg||
nt|yuval10: they still hold a very solid position in this match|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must be tough for father Magnus Eriksson in the audience. He has one daughter in one team, the other daughter in the other team|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: so far..|pg||
nt|minimonkey: Dont suppose anyone knows the reason the "Iceland Juniors" are called that?|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's an interesting hand right there|pg||
nt|yuval10: we all know|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: e/w have the balance biut duplication in hearts and a misfit|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c weak in @d or strong?|pg||
nt|hedyg: wish we had a CC for EW|pg||
nt|lestergold: must  be weak|pg||
nt|hedyg: anyhow looks like it|pg||
nt|yuval10: I can't find any lead to beat 3NT from East here|pg||
nt|yuval10: not even K@s, which kills the @d suit, but declarer can play on @c's anyway and make 9|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: Fantunes-style 2@s ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n by east of course a lucky spot because north not on lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: a nice solid 3n for a flat board|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|petergill: In Swedish Jacoby, responder can also shows his own singleton over 3@C if he prefers, which is useful with hands too strong to splinter|pg||
nt|hedyg: N feeling sick|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks likely that they'll gain some imps over here, too|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Sandra and Cecilia Rimstedt both in the East chairs|pg||
nt|athene: on the contrary - he is happy whoever wins!|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|hedyg: so more flexible in your opinion|pg||
nt|hedyg: no 1@s bid by N|pg||
nt|petergill: And Swedish Jacoby, sometimes called Stenberg I think, allows 2NT on suitable hands with 3 card support too. |pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: no undo|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol ok Johnny|pg||
nt|hedyg: we believe you!|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d?|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimonkey: Is it that simple? :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: they played n Iceland last year and won|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Needs a tie|pg||
mb|1N|nt|daman: and only over a weak NT opening   not over a strong NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c?|pg||
nt|hedyg: better now|pg||
nt|yuval10: brave bid by E on the other table, she bided 3NT with JXX and it was on the money|pg||
nt|lestergold: now this dangerous intervention by south may prove lucky for n/s making it almost impossible for east to bid no trumps|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 4 sp is normal, but beatable on h lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: it's the very same team that played ( and won ) the Nordic Championship, that was held in Iceland|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|mtvesuvius: needs to drop Qx@h offside|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm perhaps an underbid from west but certainly an overbid gtom east|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 2sp was 6c and 9-11hp|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Solution: Drop a card on the floor, and get a good look|pg||
nt|lestergold: wont succeed unless neck very long|pg||
nt|yuval10: ok, i might be wrong, though :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Johnny|pg||
nt|minimonkey: Ahhh, OK|pg||
nt|yuval10: it wasn't really last year, hardly last month|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzqy: it was 2h by south|pg||
nt|petergill: A trusting 3@H call, trusting partner to have a good suit to enter the auction vulnerable at the 2-level|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite a weird bidding, by both rooms|pg||
nt|hedyg: well i must admit i do not understand the 4@H bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh well.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes bt is the hand he expected|pg||
nt|hedyg: she could have bid double instead of 3@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: but|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is that a cue bid?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think W is worth a 4@c bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: for me yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think it should be, Bill|pg||
nt|daman: 4@C has to be a cue I would think|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So you don't get dealt xx-xx-xx-KQJxxxx|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi all, back from Poland :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: the lead hasnt hurt|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Sometimes yes, but then I must bid 3@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: i bid 3@s over 3@H with that|pg||
nt|daman: I wouldn't bid 4@C with that|pg||
nt|bjacobs: nice|pg||
nt|henryb: and what would you bid with x xx Qx KJ109xxxx?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and he has two sons in a third team!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps you barrack for the daughter who cleans the house better|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: north then too strong for 2s in thie system|pg||
nt|hedyg: the few hcps he has are in his pd's short suits|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Rob, welcome|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi Rob|pg||
nt|yuval10: East doesn't have ANY points in P's suit, looks to me that 3@h is an overbid, not to mention 4|pg||
nt|yuval10: must confess i'd have overcalled with South's hand|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt looks very possible on these hands|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk3: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/league/division.php?action=view&id=2255  for the tournament website with results, standing and other tidbits|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi|pg||
nt|lestergold: an overtrick may emerge|pg||
nt|minimonkey: E having found at least a 10 card fit (probably more) can ignore high card points will all that shape he has|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@d -1|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hedyg: when pd shows 2 suits why bother him with mine?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: West's 3@H showed Values probably|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4d a simple case of findiing qd|pg||
nt|thegarve:  it meshes well NS need to lead @h else EW are a tempo ahead in 4@s|pg||
nt|wygbe1: h shift after the first trump also good enough|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would be feeling sick and leave the room, Henry|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C then 1NT was presumably 17-19 or so?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yuval10: ok, then after winning K@s, declarer should play K@c|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Roland :)|pg||
nt|wygbe1: pretty easy h shift for south here|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yuval10: or @c to the K now|pg||
nt|lestergold: odds favour playing it in north hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yuval10: hello Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Good evening everyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
nt|lestergold: do not folloow point of  that play|pg||
nt|daman: hi Rob|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: in that case east may have the bid|pg||
nt|thegarve:  other room sneaked it home|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/league/division.php?action=view&id=2255  for the tournament website with results, standing and other tidbits|pg||
pc|cK|nt|petergill: Pretty normal to bid to 4@H, just unlucky that there are 4 losers - that's my opinion|pg||
pc|c8|nt|daman: Meck would bid a confident 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, I would have pre-empted in clubs long time ago|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I happen to think that 4@C should be natural|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep 3n+1|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  could be make here |pg||
nt|athene: so north should just bid 3nt, vul, in my opinion|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yuval10: but it has the disadvatage that the defense can find the @d ruff|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, it's a calculated risk|pg||
nt|lestergold: unlucky but flat|pg||
nt|hedyg: he promised 9-11 and is minimum of that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/q7l6em  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|wygbe1: sheesh|pg||
nt|ady: was a chance for n/s     |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|wygbe1: this defense i do not understand|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|hedyg: btw i would have opened that 3@c..|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: even if you make 2NT on the nose you don't feel an overwhelming sense of happiness|pg||
pc|d7|pc|cQ|nt|bjacobs: Whereas if you bid 3NT and it goes down, you feel delighted that at least you were having a go?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|yuval10: as declarer needs to ruff the @h, he'll go for the drop and make his contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe south thought thatthe long heart would get rid of spade loser but with the clubs staring at him in dummy there was no chance of that|pg||
pc|sT|nt|daman: no kidding|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, if you have a natural club bid available (rather than 1NT), then the cue makes sense|pg||
nt|athene: of course|pg||
pc|s5|nt|wygbe1: declarer to the rescue|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt - 1 scores better than 2nt tick, doesn't it?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s6|nt|daman: -2   doink|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yuval10: only -1|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: For newcomers. 'Myra' in Swedish means 'ant', so 'One ant and three elephants'. The ant is Irma Petersen for sure. She's a head shorter than her teammates :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|wygbe1: ping pong |pg||
pc|s8|pg||

nt|lestergold: yes nice card play|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h was quite an overbid on the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As I said, it is very early in Sweden. There should be a law against playing at this hour on a Sunday|pg||
nt|ady: well at least they gained 3 imps|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|Walddk2: I am looking forward to watching "Three cool dudes and a babe" later :)|pg||
nt|petergill: At the last World Junior Pairs in 2007, the Swedes Cecilia and Sandra Rimstedt taught us Aussies how to play Swedish Jacoby. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bech will pass this as happened in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 1NT=11-16|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C majors, but Bech can't be interested|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 2@C= asptro, @h + 1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 11-16 is an impossible range if you ask *me*|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: But it's a deep position to say: "4@C is natural if not a passed hand, cue otherwise"|pg||
nt|henryb: indeed. as a passed hand the cue bid interpretation makes sense|pg||
nt|hedyg: what a lucky slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: anybody know what 1@H shows?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not that bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is 1@H 8+ balanced?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pity we don't have the CCs|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|Walddk2: Impossible to control|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: do they use a range-finder?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C a game-forcing relay|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if there was a misunderstanding in the other room?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Says nothing about clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No heart stopper, and unclear whether you are off 3 top hearts for 5@C|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|petergill: The next World Junior Pairs is in Turkey in August - don't miss it if you're under 25|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 8+ denying a 5-card major and 6-card minor|pg||
nt|ady: game should be bid here by n/s  in spite of bad fit |pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|roswolf: 5@D looks a very good result in the other room|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In the CR, N/S established a missing key card and missing spade queen ... the joys of RKCB|pg||
nt|hedyg: anybody open 1@H in 3rd?|pg||
nt|lestergold: in the closed e/w got rathe rhigh but surprisingly let off withou a double|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: Yes, they use 2@C for that|pg||
nt|thegarve:  playble if it denies 4M|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: mind you, 6@h is less than 50%, so you do not want to be there|pg||
nt|lestergold: same again|pg||
nt|thegarve:  its a decison whethere 3H is encouraging and to use 2NT as lebensohl|pg||
nt|lestergold: well you have to double with the south hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i am trying to guess how they made 5@d..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, maybe it's too good for me|pg||
nt|henryb: Okay; I do not want to be there. It requires guessing spades and favorable breaks in both majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess Henry means 6@S. Not even I would want to be in 6@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|daman: and that is saying something|pg||
nt|henryb: no; I meant 6@h on the previous hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh that one|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yesterday's news|pg||
nt|daman: Roland would always be in 6@H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But strangely, the <50% applies here as well.  Maybe it's around 40%|pg||
nt|daman: needs 5 of 6 things to be right|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s unlikely to make but 3c makes cards lie very badly for n/s|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW on the other table did well in defeating this contract 2 down...with @c lead from W declarer has 6 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d=12-16 BAL (depend on vul) or 11-16 and 4441 or 11-16 4+@D may have longer @cs|pg||
nt|lestergold: most leads help declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: no thx|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This contract has problems!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 3@C=inv with clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Told you it was a tough hand ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This contract can't make on best defence|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C   a make     4@S may make  without diamonds played early    and even 3NT makes|pg||
nt|athene: it's unfortunate that even on a club lead, declarer can't make this|pg||
nt|athene: since she has no way to get to hand and bash out four rounds of trumps|pg||
pc|d9|nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No reason to do anything holding both majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So they play Astro, hearts and another. Still, it is not brain surgery to figure out that partner's second suit is spades. West's hand is worth close to nothing unless played in ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: clubs|pg||
nt|athene: without giving up the diamond control|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And a great lead to boot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
nt|ady: thats the lead  to beat the contract|pg||
nt|athene: and east isn't going to lead a stiff with that trump holding anyway|pg||
nt|athene: trump lead was the only way this was making|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The 9 showing none or two higher. Also known as a coded 9|pg||
nt|athene: or 3 rounds of hearts i guess|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A heart lead would have been difficult for the defence.  Somehow they have to work out not to play a third round, but to switch to a minor|pg||
nt|ady: I suppose awkard on any lead   becuase of lack of cimmunication    but it would slip through if decednce played 3 rounds of hearts|pg||
nt|athene: it has to be specifically a diamond shift after @H @H doesn't it?|pg||
nt|ady: defence|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yuval10: and some good options for 7th... like T@s|pg||
pc|d7|nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@s has a play|pg||
nt|daman: nice lead in any event|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H showed 4+@s, 1@s showed 3@ss|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like declarer can make 8 tricks here..he'll discard a @s and a @d from dummy, and @s from hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: you might have a case there Hedy, because the bidding implies that E has a balanced hand, for not bidding over the weak NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: transfers after 1@C so 1D was 4+@h|pg||
nt|yuval10: in depends on EW's defense vs the mini-NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 2@S = strong with 4@s and 6(5)+@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT emergency brakes|pg||
nt|minimonkey: The hearts are well placed for declarer here|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps N will lead @d|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok, 1@c 17+ any, 1@H= 8+balanced or unbalanced with 5-4 minors|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yuval10: then play AK@c and T@c to establish the suit|pg||
nt|minimonkey: if N had HTxxx they could set 3NT through a heart lead and continuation ducked by N|pg||
nt|athene: on a club switch declarer can win and ruff a heart to hand then bash out 4 spades|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, you are right - the third heart is transport back to hand|pg||
nt|athene: and east can't play another club to cut her off from dummy|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hedyg: very well play by Jansson|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: played*|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: 6@C is better than 6@S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One of these blind luck swings|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: now you can run the @s to the  on the way back.|pg||
nt|yuval10: @s to K, @d to Q, and @d ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: so one dim one club 2 spades 2 hearts thats 6 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: now @c and read the position in defense|pg||
nt|lestergold: where is 7th coming from?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: 2@H looks easier certainly |pg||
nt|petergill: I think cashing @Ca could have been left until later|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3 tricks easier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/WomensTeams/Sweden/rimstedt-sjoberg.pdf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks to Carina Westlin|pg||
nt|bjacobs: She might run this lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If it works, she has 12 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although she doesn't have to on this spade layout|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If it fails, she looks to be finished|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C by South is the best slam if you want to be in slam that is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the last match today; play will resume at 9.00 local time, 8 am London, 5 pm Sydney, in the middle of the night in North America|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2 or 3 in a minimum balanced hand|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: i cant see how declarer can avoid the loss of 2c 2s and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|yuval10: he probably won't risk @d finesse though, and will settle for 7|pg||
nt|minimonkey: Looks like N decided she had too few entries to bother with her own suit and would instead try to help partner|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mtvesuvius: -1 now|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence can make 3c and 3dims now and that will leave declarer a trick short wont be able to establish a seventh trick|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: 4h i dont see the extra values to justify it|pg||
nt|lestergold: partner promuised zilch|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|lestergold: providing they get clubs right|pg||
nt|mariner1: the problem with this treatment is that it exposes the better hand in a usually tough|pg||
nt|mariner1: contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: on the other room yes, here i think 4@h by East is justified|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: open "movie" and click the other table to see the play|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mtvesuvius: small trump return makes this -2 now|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course with the club avalanche in no trumps 2s a better spot than 1N|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
nt|yuval10: wow|pg||
nt|lestergold: misere cover|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
nt|petergill: His aim is to make at least 8 tricks in 2@H, so possble spade overruffs could be afforded, |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Quite a tough psychological decision ... in theory, running the lead was the percentage play ... but how likely was the lead to be from the king?|pg||
nt|hedyg: thinking to finesse H10x in @S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's an ugly card - it means that she is going to have to play the second spade whilst a trump is outstanding|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's making the all-or-nothing finesse at trick 1 look better and better|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: would you assume opp led from K@H vs slam?|pg||
nt|wygbe1: for a while several years ago, a 10-18 no trump was used by some, with a 3-way range finder,  in match point events here - then the acbl outlawed it|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bjacobs: Depends on the opp, I guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Against someone rating themselves "world class" on BBO, I would bet they DON'T have the king|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: and small @s|pg||
nt|yuval10: and NOW she has a timing even for +1 if she plays @s towards the 9|pg||
nt|yuval10: and she does|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So 8 imps, and the patient is still breathing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Still a glimmer of hope for Filips Fanclub|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c2|nt|bjacobs: But someone rating themselves "Advanced" - play him for the king|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: unlucky hand, but probably -3|pg||
nt|hedyg: wd|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|yuval10: might be -3 now|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: since he will lead a @H to the Queen...|pg||
nt|po-s: silly H discard|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h7|nt|petergill: Trump control is an issue for declarer now, due to @Ca being cashed early|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Remember they need to win by at least 29 IMPs to overtake Iceland Juniors|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s5|nt|bjacobs: My theory is that World Class players don't know what they are doing|pg||

nt|daman: that's called "winning ugly"|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: coulda been -1 there with the favorable @c spots|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hedyg: now 1 @D as well|pg||

mb|2N!|nt|petergill: but i would have continued with 3@H, requesting cue bids, not 4@H|pg||
nt|daman: not any more|pg||
nt|daman: quatre carreaux|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It was raining for 2 full weeks!|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 2@H= @s or both minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but same finish|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 2NT=lebensolh|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d gf stayman|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: the play double stayman|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|roswolf: the punt rather spoiled things - 3! would have allowed south to show his handH|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tough for Lindström without a spade control|pg||
nt|hedyg: how about 3@s by N denying control in minors?|pg||
nt|petergill: South likes her controls, but is minimum|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not like the 1n bid by north|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s= 8+, 5+@hs|pg||
nt|yuval10: very impressive performance by the "fanclub" team so far, in both rooms|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n the money bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: they can stretch it forward by bidding 3NT here|pg||
nt|lestergold: the pragamtic bid what else folks?|pg||
nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
nt|mariner1: now its found|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s a normal contract facing an unlucky distribution|pg||
nt|hedyg: so E on lead all contracts now|pg||
nt|hedyg: except NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: once again we see how bad is it to ask RKCB when you have 2 ( or more ) quick losers in a suit|pg||
nt|minimonkey: So I think that means that 2D is GF, so South can go past 2NT to show her 5+ diamonds|pg||
nt|yuval10: it's just that RKCB can't help you in those situations|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Frazer, gf stayman|pg||
nt|yuval10: N in the other table would've done a lot better by bidding 4@s, if he wants to try slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/league/division.php?action=view&id=2255  for the tournament website with results and other tidbits|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North does not lack courage|pg||
nt|daman: as a rule, most juniors do not lack courage|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT should show 19+|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Say, 19-21|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The 1@S response here is surely better than the 1@H in the other room|pg||
nt|yuval10: N realizes her @s problem|pg||
nt|minimonkey: No way they get to slam here with S having at most a 12 count, it has now been wrongsided for the club lead if S had the king instead of the queen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They know their system these youngsters. They put a lot of effort into it|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hedyg: now 13 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: definitely 10000% better|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: North needs to pass hoping partner will reopen with a double|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would pass and bid 2h on the next round to play|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: now he can kill his vulnerable opponents|pg||
nt|yuval10: but bid 3NT nontheless|pg||
nt|lestergold: allowed to rely on the strong hand holding something there|pg||
nt|mariner1: lost again?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: this will do|pg||
nt|daman: I once was lost and now I am found|pg||
nt|thegarve:  a double would have made the play easier|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed clear double in my view|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@d X could've been interesting |pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 1 off though|pg||
mb|4N|nt|lestergold: confucious he say play 3n with nine top trik and all suits stopped|pg||
nt|yuval10: this is the 10th tricks now|pg||
nt|yuval10: 11 more for the admirers of Filip|pg||
nt|thegarve:  South should double this knowing the a@S is an entry|pg||
nt|athene: once E-W find a big heart fit, north knows his partner's second suit is a minor|pg||
nt|athene: and he is lucky enough to have both - although the 5-level is very high if you might have only a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Enter North, stage left|pg||
nt|ady: seems n/s should save in 5@D here agains the e/w 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 2@s= minimum, 3@c=no singelton and 5card @H |pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: i wonder who is Filip|pg||
nt|yuval10: i know|pg||
mb|5D|nt|lestergold: or as u say pass the reopening double if it comes|pg||
nt|lestergold: either way i want to play this hand in hearts eitehr by us or preferably the opps|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|yuval10: the new-born sun of Sara Sivelind and Karl Asplund, which are of course a very close friends for both NS here and EW on the other table|pg||
nt|yuval10: Son, sry|pg||
nt|hedyg: and i am told he is 1 month old and very cute|pg||
nt|hedyg: over 4@d no cuebid by N, wd|pg||
nt|yuval10: an awkward auction, but they stayed out of slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: well, I don't particularly want to play in 2@h knowing I'm getting a 5-1/6-0 split|pg||
nt|lestergold: do you not agree that 1n was a dreadful bid?|pg||
nt|jaheim: .|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Yes Hedy, that is a possible way to bid it, if that's your agreement. Probably not their agreement here, or else she could have bid it|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: what I would like to do is penalize 2@c or 2@s or wherever they run|pg||
nt|yuval10: he's surely does :)  as cute as a baby can be|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hedyg: hmm|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like @s and 2@h's and 5 imps for the 2008 champs|pg||
nt|mariner1: George can you "see" the @D now? :)|pg||
nt|daman: sure can   scroll up|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10 imps|pg||
nt|yuval10: if 3@h was suit, and 3@s was cuebid agreeing @h's, hard to understand why North didn't bid 4@h over 4@d|pg||
nt|yuval10: ut perhaps they played it some other way|pg||
nt|minimonkey: I suppose S having A??? xxx  Kxxxx A??? is possible but as was just said if partner has that hand 1 slam try ought to be enough|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Where was that coffin you were nailing Roland?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: why did she do that?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|hedyg: she probably thought 2@H had shown her hand already|pg||
nt|lestergold: does south know that the double shows a void??|pg||
nt|athene: east will play @DA and another, presumably, but declarer can eventually set up the fifth spade|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yuval10: North went for an extra overtrick here|pg||
nt|yuval10: not bad, when she knows she can't lose more than 3 @h's|pg||
nt|lestergold: was safe to do so|pg||
nt|mariner1: Amazing grace! How sweet the sound|pg||
nt|mariner1: That saved a wretch like me!|pg||
nt|mariner1: I once was lost, but now am found;|pg||
nt|mariner1: Was blind, but now I see|pg||
pc|c3|nt|daman: going to be hard to beat this|pg||
nt|hedyg: she is trying to avoid the @c finesse|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: so you play in 2 hearts and opps have a trump trick ur only at 2 level|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Westlin|pg||
nt|wygbe1: dont know what west is thinking about - h exit is automatic|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|hedyg: she had a sort of squeeze on W|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think he expected it|pg||
nt|lestergold: if not it would be extremely dangerous to double for penalties|pg||
nt|thegarve:  north should have bid over 2NT knowing south was short in @S|pg||
nt|hedyg: then she could have bid 4@c|pg||
nt|minimonkey: Good point|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yuval10: 2NT over 2NT ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: well... what can he bid?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hedyg: though once the K@s was in W chances are the rest is in E|pg||
pc|c5|nt|wygbe1: yikes|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 2@H is fine; then 3@H over 2NT setting the suit and asking for lowest cue bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhhhhhhhhh nooooooooooo!|pg||
nt|yuval10: oops|pg||
nt|daman: an old bagpipe favo(u)rite|pg||
nt|ady: seems  should be -300     time to set up 5th spade|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: i wonder about the 2NT bid with no @s stopper..|pg||
nt|ady: 8 imps for n/s|pg||
nt|athene: declarer is just wondering whether to ruff this or pitch the @H2, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't matter as the cards lie|pg||
nt|athene: he knows west doesn't have a singleton diamond but he might be thinking about @Dxxx with west and stiff @DA with east|pg||
nt|athene: then it would be a bit harder to get the long spade going|pg||
pc|h2|nt|thegarve:  there are snails who sit there forever, Roland has a top 10|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This way, you can cross ruff|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: if east doesn't have a trump to return|pg||
nt|athene: and if east DOES have a trump to return you know they are 2-2|pg||
nt|athene: so you can set up the spade|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: actually not just sort of|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So the heart discard was probably very good play|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|mtvesuvius: true, but I think that if partner bids 2@d, there is no reason for me not to let him play there|pg||
nt|thegarve:  I must play with at least 5 of the top 10 or it feels like that|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|lestergold: you must let him in this sequence i agree|pg||
nt|hedyg: what has he done?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: if 2@H is strong ok to bid 3@d IMO|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|yuval10: Carl Ragnarsson informs me now that Filip, and his mother of course, is in the VUgraph room, having his meal |pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hedyg: claim?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petergill: AKQ to eight is 8 out of 13 tricks, equivalent (well, sort of equivalent) to about 24/40 or 25/40 high card points, so North might simply have 4NT'd her way to 6@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: she..|pg||
nt|daman: compressed a making game into one which fails|pg||
nt|mariner1: seems to be lost now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: yes, although perhaps with stiff @DA east should return a heart to let her partner lead another trump|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yuval10: even if the @h's are 3-3, he needs the @d finesse in order to make this|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|hedyg: that should not show extras just strength|pg||
nt|lestergold: do we need to know that?|pg||
nt|yuval10: as she can only manage 4@h's, 4@c's and 1@s at most|pg||
nt|yuval10: it's a she, of course|pg||
pc|s6|nt|petergill: I agree with Roland|pg||
nt|mariner1: Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man, Though my mind could think I|pg||
nt|mariner1: still was a mad man, I hear the voices when I'm dreaming, I can hear them say ....|pg||
nt|mariner1: - Kansas|pg||
nt|daman: 14 IMP swing on that one play|pg||
nt|mariner1: well we have all done that........... ( too often)|pg||

nt|pocken: Good aftrenoon|pg||
nt|petergill: Summary - that was a tricky hand to bid.|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Per-Ola, welcome|pg||
nt|petergill: Hello Per-Ola|pg||
nt|lestergold: the point is that 1n was anawful bid by north|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: we already agreed that...|pg||
nt|lestergold: did we|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I thought so :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: need to go now, thanks all and see you later!!|pg||
nt|hedyg: Saturday afternnon?|pg||
nt|lestergold: bye shalom, Yuval|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Yuval|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She had a blind spot, happens to all of us|pg||
nt|po-s: what can he make?|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he bids 3@c i guess NS will find themself in 5@c very quickly|pg||
nt|wygbe1: then declarer gave it back by not playing the good club when the only trump out was the ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed I have Martin|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You don't want to see it|pg||
nt|thegarve:  please name and shame|pg||
nt|minimonkey: Not having cued 4C N sould see 2 quick losers in the suit and knew to stay out of slam|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think it was at all clear to save with north's hand|pg||
nt|athene: with @SA and a heart trick|pg||
nt|athene: but it sure worked|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry hedy saturday afternoon kitchen nightmare site|pg||
nt|hedyg: she must feel terrible :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: trick compression is an "Art" with some of us :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: and once again West keeps on bidding north's suits|pg||
nt|daman: so it is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fine slam bid by the young ladies in the other room|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|Walddk2: I guess E-W can match it here|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d!|nt|petergill: South has a lot of catching up to do, to show her hand|pg||
nt|pocken: With a standard treatment of a 2H jump shift, 1C!  - 1H! - 1NT - 3Sp! would do the trick|pg||
nt|yuval10: and N keeps bidding NT...|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry its a bridge nightmare site not a kitchen nightmare site |pg||
nt|lestergold: whats going on here|pg||
nt|lestergold: fun iondeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only Top 5 for now. 1-2: PO Sundelin, Barnet Shenkin - 3-4: Andrew Robson, Glenn Grøtheim - 5: Bauke Muller|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|lestergold: west's turn to be carted off to the bridge prison|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H= 10-13|pg||
nt|lestergold: for a vulnerable overcall in suchsa dangeropus position i think two consecuitive life sentences|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s should reach 3n here which has good chances|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   on for n/s       bad result  in CR   3S_2  for -200|pg||
mb|3D|nt|petergill: 3@C is a bit conservative|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the 1 opening didnt do justice to it|pg||
nt|lestergold: ew for e/wis enormous|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think this 1NT is as bad as the previous one|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s for e/w enormous|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: tough to find 4@s now|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is gonna hurt|pg||
nt|yuval10: "The babes" are surely gaining ground as the match prograss|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: this 1NT is just as bad as the last one...|pg||
nt|hedyg: his pd will kill him first, the rest of the team later|pg||
nt|athene: quite an aggressive overcall with no aces - but you have decent playing strength i suppose|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: 4@H?|pg||
nt|yuval10: if 3@s is GF+ with 6+ @s's, West's hand is excellent against it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H looks like 'flag' for spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: flag being?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: flag = I like spades very much and I have honour concentration in hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: could be worse i guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: funnily enuf north will not actually retire on the penalty|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes found some good cards in E|pg||
nt|lestergold: but west still needs a tuff word from the coach perhaps behind the bike shed|pg||
nt|hedyg: low encouraging|pg||
nt|lestergold: swop the j and 4 of spades and the q and 5 of clubs for example|pg||
nt|hedyg: Johnny?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and u have more bloodshed than in the french reolution|pg||
nt|lestergold: revolution|pg||
nt|lestergold: or Ramsey's kitchen nightmares|pg||
nt|hedyg: are they taking a break?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: Sandra is thinking!|pg||
nt|lestergold: west is probably hiding|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhhh ty|pg||
nt|yuval10: @s lead is best of course, but not much indication for West to lead it|pg||
nt|cicus: might easily lose 2 diamond|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he plays the doubkle dim finesse which is probably better odds than ace and another|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: north has to rescue this for her side|pg||
nt|roswolf: no double?|pg||
nt|yuval10: lol they just found it|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland wants to be in 6s which makes i think|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: lol|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: did I miss something? lol|pg||
nt|yuval10: our 3rd match will be a very interesting one|pg||
nt|mariner1: anyone play garbage stayman with W?|pg||
nt|yuval10: Iceland juniors VS "the babes"|pg||
nt|cicus: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: trick onj lead |pg||
nt|yuval10: so it's quite hard to understand 4@s is that context, Roland|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: ok, 3@S was 1@s3@h and both minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1@H by N would show 20+|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So 1@S = ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d was 0-7|pg||
nt|hedyg: it doesnt say :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 1sp 4+, could be canape|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/WomensTeams/Sweden/rimstedt-sjoberg.pdf|pg||
nt|daman: 1@S was canape?|pg||
nt|lestergold: adam do you tyhink the 1n card should be removed from svenson's biddin g box?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: no. I just think he needs to use it less often|pg||
nt|yuval10: lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the entry position may force declarer to get the diamonds right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Perhaps, but Asplund had no longer a cue bid available at the 4-level|pg||
nt|athene: E-W play transfer advances after overcalls? -  so 2@H = transfer to spades = good raise|pg||
nt|ady: 5 diamonds also should make for n/s|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: yes they do|pg||
nt|bjacobs: lowering the coffin into the ground ...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: ty Johnny|pg||
nt|bjacobs: makes sense ... 4 spades, < 20, South knew to close proceedings|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: could be|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: west is expecting thinmgsnlioke the qc to be wrong|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hedyg: he must play for the Q@C to be on|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Per-Ola Cullin|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Per-Ola|pg||
nt|pocken: hi|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Finally a person who knows the system|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Please explain|pg||
nt|hedyg: we hope!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, this is the end of the championships|pg||
nt|athene: if west had raised direct to the 3-level that might have made things much harder for NS|pg||
pc|d8|nt|thegarve:  played Grotheim recently and he held his reputation, but he did defend a few of the hands in tempo|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 2@C followed by 2H was 11-13 6+@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thx Tommy|pg||
pc|d3|nt|daman: Hi Per-Ola|pg||
nt|hedyg: why play 9@s?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  might take a double @d finesse|pg||
nt|thegarve:  the first three do sit there and sit there and sit there|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: no 5@C - i think south badly mis-evaluated her hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: not obvious to play @d now|pg||
nt|minimonkey: I thought 3S seemed far too natural...|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This auction has been decoded|pg||
nt|pocken: @S = 16-19 4+|pg||
nt|daman: a spec says.....I think, 1S=4+ can be 5, over 1NT response 2C would be 5+S, 2D/2H canape with 5+ suits and 2S canape with 5+ clubs..|pg||
nt|pocken: 1NT asks|pg||
nt|pocken: 2@C = 5+@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 made next case|pg||
nt|yuval10: and he does|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhhh bidding misunderstanding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A deserved win for Iceland Juniors, an average of over 22 VPs before this match|pg||
nt|athene: but even with 4-card support, her offence/defence ratio wasn't good|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: has to get back to hand for the fourth club|pg||
nt|athene: with all the high cards in the opps' suits, it looked more like a 3-card raise|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bjacobs: How old is the N/S pair?|pg||
nt|pocken: 24-26-ish|pg||
nt|daman: Roland's age|pg||
nt|lestergold: phew says west|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs suggesting singleton 8@S in S|pg||
nt|Walddk3: http://tinyurl.com/q7l6em  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|thegarve:  going off|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade switch now|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually heart is good enuf|pg||

nt|thegarve:  watch out if Alan Mayo (recently back on the UK scene) gets onto vugraph - a medallst  for sure|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What did 1@D show?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 11-13bal or 11-16 with @D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So the @DK wasn't necessarily a bad value.  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: And certainly the @HAQ had good chances of being over the king|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: the points weren't necessarily wasted, they were just defensive values as well as attacking|pg||
nt|athene: West in the other room did show a mixed 3-level raise right away|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So you'd have to say West's hand was pretty good.  It's true that she gave the opponents room to find 3NT, but it's just hindsight to suggest she should have bid it differently|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bjacobs: Thanks ... so I guess relatively experienced|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh my|pg||
pc|h2|nt|thegarve:  smith peter in @c says continue hearts|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: not even if added!|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: When I started teaching my younger brother how to play bridge, he became obsessed with opening 1NT. He opened 1NT on any hand that had 11+ HCP in it... This seems to be a similar ...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: case :)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its only oveertricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite hard to blame E for playing the Ace to prevent probably @h ruffs|pg||
nt|hedyg: squeeze on S or so she thinks|pg||
nt|mariner1: what is the translation of the EW team name?|pg||
nt|hedyg: E showed 5-4 minors with singleton @s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In the other rom, South had bid 1NT ... now the hand is much weaker|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yuval10: i meant our last match for the day|pg||

nt|lestergold: well er em 1100 perhaps a little sad but the bid deserved to be punished in my opinion but apparently not in one or two specs opinions|pg||
nt|cicus: 2 declarers feeling bad|pg||
nt|hedyg: only..|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board of this quick match now|pg||
nt|athene: if you leave opps plenty of room when you have a nine-card fit, you need to have some specific reason for it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: She did ... game try|pg||
nt|athene: yes but you can show strength and still go to the 3-level|pg||
nt|athene: as west did in the other room |pg||
mb|1C!|nt|daman: Roland has seen a third generation of trees|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Because this gives them exposure to many common tactical situations|pg||
nt|Walddk3: N-S are very experienced, E-W are not, so please bear with them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 17+|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: true but there are hands that qualify and therefore i try to cater for them|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: nice slam here, but it must be played in @c|pg||
nt|lestergold: well anothyer corker|pg||
nt|Walddk3: That was how we all learned the game, the hard way|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm could be trouble here|pg||
mb|d!|nt|bjacobs: Whereas playing obscure big club methods, you lose that experience|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s now?|pg||
nt|yuval10: a bit pessimistic approach by E IMO|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6c for e/w with a 6s good save available|pg||
nt|hedyg: you all pass in W?|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards spitting here at e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: OK I give in - West bid it badly|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: im still learning it Roland the hard way|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I do|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@d = 9-11 ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: thanks to our outstanding operator Tommy Andersson, great job! to my excellent fellow commentators Yuval Yener, Frazer Morgan and Roland Wald for donating their time and expertise ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: to guide us through these boards; as well as to the Swedish Bridge Federation(Carina Westlin) and the Filbyter Bridge Club (Carl Ragnarsson) for sharing this event with us.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this hand is close to slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: east must surely bid 4s over 3s!|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, East was a bit pessimistic, but it does require partner to have the K@h|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: otherwise it's not a very good slam to be in|pg||
nt|lestergold: or heart finesse also|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL we all are|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes I do,,,,,,,|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|hedyg: join the club|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: yes|pg||
nt|yuval10: at least that what it was previously :)|pg||
nt|cicus: should be a raise, it was for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w havr  stayed fortuiously low...... so far|pg||
nt|hedyg: special thanks to our specs for joining and the kind and helpful comments, we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back at 3:50 am Los Angeles, 6:50 am New York, 12.50 Paris, 11:50 am London, 8:50 pm Sydney|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@s , if shows shortness, will discourage South|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 4@s is better because it can also create a force and help the partnership in this particular situation when opps bid 5@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'll preserve my right to remain silent.... :P|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|daman: moi aussi|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice stop by East, might be tempting to bid some more|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT  17-19|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H is interesting here - given that south bid 1@D a moment ago to show spades + minor|pg||
mb|2N|nt|pocken: sorry answered E-W age, N is even younger, and played for a looong time, so sure she tried natural system|pg||
nt|bjacobs: sorry, |pg||
nt|lestergold: south may have been tempted to dip[ his oar in the water|pg||
nt|thegarve:  should compete with 2@h pass is sleepy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/q7l6em  for running scores in all matches|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: as a spec suggests 6@C looks good|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: well, that's one way to bid it|pg||
nt|lestergold: doesnt cost to bid 4s then west with good clubs and an outside high card may get the message|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: double is a bridge gaol offence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/q7l6em  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 2@d=3-sup 9+|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 3@s= void|pg||
nt|yuval10: thanks Hedy, Roland, Frazer, thanks all|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d either natural gf or 9-11 with fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: 4@s is definitely right though|pg||
nt|yuval10: 13 tricks comming EW's way now|pg||
nt|yuval10: 9+ in their case|pg||
nt|yuval10: if it stays the same now, then after lunch, we'll have 1st vs 2nd, with 15 VP's seperating between the teams|pg||
nt|yuval10: therefor, "the fanclub" would have to win 23:7 to win the title|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: more than close?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you would expect X to be @H + minor|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT seems likely to make e/w  as in closed room     10@S  doubleton in north hand makes life easier |pg||
nt|athene: sorry 1@D was @S + another i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: D by arvidsson would have been @h + 1|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mtvesuvius: and now a double my Melin based on his "2@s tricks"|pg||
nt|hedyg: can they find the grand on a finesse?|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice lead by N|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: his hand is nmegative value in defence lucfky that his spade would stand if pard led it|pg||
nt|lestergold: if southc doubles for takeout north bids 3c then east bids 3s and that gets whacked|pg||
nt|lestergold: south shopuld probably put some pressure on especially not vul he can stand playing in 3 denominations|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: ok, just the slam|pg||
nt|mariner1: well no entries to dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Iceland Juniors 13 VPs clear at this point|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes not in @H, in @c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This lead won't paralyse declarer, but nothing would have|pg||
nt|ady: passive 10@S lead|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bjacobs: I am told North about 21-22|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: i cannot understand how n/s stayed in a part score in the closed room|pg||
nt|lestergold: and only managed to make 5 as spec points out|pg||
nt|yuval10: personally, i hate to TO double with void|pg||
nt|cicus: many hate but voids keep coming|pg||
nt|Walddk2: from Filips fanclub|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yuval10: unless E tries a @s now|pg||
nt|yuval10: in the last match, that is|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk3: Because they are young and inexperienced, and because they are on vugraph for the first time in their lives|pg||
nt|yuval10: which he doesn't|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|mtvesuvius: He needs to pass, which should be suggesting a save|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|yuval10: many times Partner will leave it with 4 cards and let them play in the 2 level with 9 cards is just horrible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In 1 hour and 15 minutes after the lunch break|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: Thx everyone, enjoy your meal|pg||
nt|yuval10: they failed to bid game in the other room on board 25, but it was still worth 8 imps|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: Melin joins the convict parade|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i do not like letting opps play in 2 level suit contracts if i can do anything about it|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|pocken: Petersen knew they had a 8+ minor suit fit, however, all depends on partner´s @S-holding|pg||
nt|ady: north will soon get end played|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: well you need to be objective and it does need a 3-2 break in trumps + other non-bad breaks|pg||
nt|lestergold: the meat wagon is filling up|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Doubling for the fun of it is not good...|pg||
nt|yuval10: a much-needed swing for "the babes"|pg||
nt|lestergold: but it only involves cashing ticks ruffing losers taking finesses Roland- |pg||
nt|Walddk3: Then you can have a debate as to whether they should have been on vugraph at all, but that's the decision of the organisers, not us. And we fully respect the decision they make|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mtvesuvius: yes, brings the match much closer.|pg||
nt|yuval10: the X only cost 3 imps|pg||
nt|yuval10: for itself, that is|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: True, but partner may have saved over 6@c|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: the double is telling partner not to same|pg||
nt|lestergold: as i originally suggested|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: save*|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes, excluding the fact that they might have find the save|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Correct|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course they should be on vu-graph|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Full stop.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|yuval10: best was to cash Q@h and play another one, but....|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: Malmölaget the defending champions|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Team picture here ...|pg||
nt|ady: now north can go nowhere|pg||

nt|ady: yes    avoid being end-played for the moment|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: is that was the case Per-Ola then i think the ant should have tried 4@C|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: 3@c probably showed 1 of the top 3 club honors|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: spade*|pg||
nt|athene: quite often, if one side plays natural weak-2 and one side plays multi (or 2@D=@H, as here) then you get swings because the tempo of the auction is changed - i.e. the other ...|pg||
nt|athene: opponent is in the passout seat|pg||
nt|athene: so on this hand for example|pg||
nt|ady: points split     e/w  unable to enter bidding    can make 3@D|pg||
nt|athene: if north opened 2@H then west would be in passout seat and might well double|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: soutyh cant be tyhat chuffed with his collection|pg||
nt|po-s: apparently Asplund doesn´t know who is on lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 13 more IMPs to Iceland Juniors|pg||
pc|dA|nt|daman: the coach needs to speak to him|pg||
nt|cicus: I can see no sensible way to it either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Make that 12|pg||
nt|thegarve:  leading a @c is giving declarer too much respect|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And now on to the last board of the match|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mtvesuvius: and once again we see a "memo to self" double... giving NS extra chance to cuebid|pg||
nt|hedyg: and W did not open the last hand..|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT rebid by N in CR|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And well matched here|pg||
nt|lestergold: Roland uve been coaching n/s|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: At MP you would want to be in 6NT (when diamonds come in)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Yes|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: 6n played by west is cold too|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: the hnadcuff sellers are out of business after all|pg||
nt|po-s: looks like they bid non-controls|pg||
nt|yuval10: well, East can't possibly ignore his own suggestion....can he? :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I'm strongly opposed to doubling cuebids, unless you really want the lead, since it helps the opponents so much|pg||
nt|lestergold: his self reminder to lead a club|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: lol, he has to listen to himself now :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: dosn cost as it happens|pg||
nt|lestergold: still a club and heart loser |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|hedyg: again a matter of agreements what 2NT means|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petergill: Yes, Ulrika's 3NT rebid was sensible|pg||
nt|lestergold: but u didnt coach east to underlead his ace of hearts thats not fair|pg||
pc|s8|nt|po-s: maybe - if West ducks a small heart from dummy he gets endplayed after two D ruffs and CA|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed P-O|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: Also possible, but Ola did not like his heart holding. Was afraid of wrong-siding NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would, must be partner's decision. Can't come as a surprise that I have six hearts|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|Walddk3: and E-W, and they will learn it eventually. Give them time|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: nice J@s|pg||
pc|s5|pc|dT|nt|yuval10: now @s from N|pg||
nt|hedyg: now @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry Yuval :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|minimonkey: No, Im not sure I would bid 3NT as E, surely 3C would be forcing having not overcalled it when you had the chance|pg||
nt|yuval10: 8 boards finished here, only 4 in the CR|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hedyg: claim|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: last board of this match coming up|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, so now there are some chances for 6...|pg||
nt|lestergold: without a spade lead or with one|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: now a push|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ola and Mikael Rimstedt in the closed room are twin brothers, 13 years young|pg||
nt|lestergold: small heart from dummy west will know to rise|pg||
nt|yuval10: he didn't even bothered|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer did well not to overruff with the K, otherwise defense would've been able to cash out the remaining tricks|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petergill: Roland, can you buy me a keybaord which does not allow any typos please?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h2|nt|hedyg: overtake and play @s|pg||
nt|lestergold: in fcat more justification for bidding 6N than 6d|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: might be communication difficulties tho|pg||
nt|yuval10: last board of the day, thanks to our capable operator - Johnny karlsson|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: thanks|pg||

pc|dA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h9|nt|petergill: Change @CJ to @CQ and you want to be in 6@D, and then I think North would have bid on to 6@d at this table|pg||

pc|h5|nt|yuval10: next match - Filips fanclub - DBK Dalom|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: 6NT can be made, due to the @C10 being very useful. |pg||
nt|hedyg: nice start with a slam|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT a bit pessimistic|pg||
nt|petergill: 31-32 balanced usually is not enough for 6NT, hence the sensible 3NT bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: mini NT |pg||
nt|daman: yep   Gavin is a fellow Canadian|pg||
nt|yuval10: i guess 2@s by N = 3(+) cards|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: 2@c was ?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And a minimal sort of result for N/S|pg||
nt|daman: SOS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Malmölaget = The Team from Malmö (Sweden's 3rd largest city after Stockholm and Göteborg)|pg||
nt|hedyg: denying a 5 card suit i assume|pg||
nt|hedyg: and @H stopper?|pg||
nt|yuval10: hence South's 3@s bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h indeed loses 2 tricks in each suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: i guess N is not happy with her @c stopper, thus no raise|pg||
nt|yuval10: very nice X|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 2hx is not abad save againsgt a n/s game albei a dodgy game|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d is general game try|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yuval10: and last match will square off the Iceland Juniors with "Filip's Fanclub"|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: an overtrick or two maybe forthcoming|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2 and 3@d seems to have been forcing|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The simple play is the complete cross ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to William FRisby|pg||
pc|dT|nt|yuval10: might make 11 tricks here with a squeeze in @h/@h over W|pg||
nt|yuval10: East knows that the suits aren't breaking for declarer|pg||
nt|hedyg: she later accepted her own gametry|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: and they sure are NOT!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right, so she might as well have punted 4@H over 2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: especially with the dim switch|pg||
nt|lestergold: but nothing terribly attracive for west to play |pg||
nt|lestergold: best hope mfiding qd with [pard|pg||
nt|yuval10: W played in the Swedish team for the "white house" tournement, that did very well by finishing 3rd |pg||
nt|Walddk2: The babe is playing in the other room, Maria Helin|pg||
nt|yuval10: both East and West played several times in the Swedish juniors/schools teams in many occasions|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tre hunkar = three cool guys|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|petergill: Without @C10, 6NT would be a poor contract. Even as the cards lie, a declarer in 6NT might fail by taking the @D finesse. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hunkar stolen from English 'hunk'|pg||
nt|lestergold: the name of that team sounds like the title of a certain kind of movie|pg||
nt|Walddk2: pronounced hoonkar|pg||
nt|yuval10: they're very creative as far as team's names are concern :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like this contract is going down a lot|pg||
nt|hedyg: a good time to play @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|athene: good afternoon everyone :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: but W could have 4+ @cs and it might be enough for 6 @Cs?|pg||
nt|yuval10: as a spec pointed out|pg||
nt|hedyg: wont need the squeeze now|pg||
nt|yuval10: but indeed, he won't need that now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nothing can stop it working - including ruffing the top diamond with @SK|pg||
pc|h5|nt|daman: this will be painful|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like only 6 tricks forthe dfence|pg||
pc|hK|nt|thegarve:  Great team name|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|bjacobs: self inflicted though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Malmölaget had a 25-4 VP win in round 1, Filips Fanclub a bye|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|petergill: East might have bid 3@C, to look for 6@C. |pg||

pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Geoffrey Wolfarth|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Alex Wilkinson|pg||
nt|yuval10: I think it might have a slight case if you play the sort of strong @c, so 1@h is limited|pg||
nt|hedyg: welcome Alex|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: So Karlsson is in 4@HX. |pg||
nt|petergill: Care required in the defence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hit the UNDO button a few times and start all over again please|pg||

nt|yuval10: a lot of international experience shared by those 2 pairs, which represent Sweden in many juniors events|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: yes, only pre-empt once|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 losers only but have to establish ten winners|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u needs two ntries to dumm to take club finesse twice maybe not so easy|pg||
