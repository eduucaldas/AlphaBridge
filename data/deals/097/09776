nt|brolucius: Hi, Jon!|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4th ag 7th |pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: hi David and Roland|pg||
nt|henryb: after P-1@d-1@h-X-P what do you bit with W?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: 1NT|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: I show the nature of my hand. 1NT does not guarantee a heart stopper as I play it|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: I prefer 2@C to a double, if it is forcing.|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: I would bid one spade|pg||
nt|brolucius: Then you can bid 2@S and partner knows what you have.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If partner is strong, he can check back with 2@H to ask if I was serious about NT|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I am glad to see that Rodwell agrees with me|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jbgood: Rodwell following your advise Roland|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: (as would I)|pg||
nt|henryb: and if partner is strong he can check back to see if I was serious about spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: You don't want to bid 1NT on x-x-x, but there is nothing else. |pg||
nt|brolucius: Fallenius is worried that the heart lead has not yet appeared.|pg||
nt|henryb: there is 1@s. AQx is surely adequate support for partner's four card suit ..|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: He is hoping that partner does not try a different suit. No, he has led a heart.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h6|pg||
nt|henryb: as several of the audience have said, 2@s should show a sound opener with 4@s and 1@s should either be three or a hand you are ashamed of|pg||
nt|jbgood: small club in case N is void - and claim 10|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jbgood: sry - 11|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: showing his hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: ace and small - keyboard cold..|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some time soon, we will get an interesting board. I have a feeling about it.|pg||
nt|henryb: we had one. Board 1|pg||
mc|11|nt|jbgood: has it been dull so far?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, there will be a 1NT contract shortly, David|pg||

mb|2D|nt|jbgood: this is not the 1 NT Roland|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|henryb: exactly the sort of hands you root for when nursing a 100 (real) imp lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: East has five clubs and four spades again!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, this is a dull 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: or another dull 3 NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: This time East has no alternative to a double, since he could not introduce his five-card suit at the two-level.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Weinstein-Levin loving these boards being 2500 IMPs ahead before the last session|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/2009/PAIRS5O.htm  for standings after session 4 of 5. There will be no running scores during the last session|pg||
mb|p|pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: 27 boards to be played, 9 rounds of 3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1@C  11-13 or 17-19 balanced, or natural|pg||
mb|1H!|mb|d|mb|p|nt|henryb: 1@h = spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|jbgood: and dbl = @hs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: easy and logic counter to the transfer|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|henryb: and a comfortable 110 for E-W|pg||
nt|jbgood: pass by Fredin denies 3 card spades (I think)|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: yes was alerted|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jbgood: if he had had 3 spades, he would have redoubled|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|brolucius: We are all hoping that this sequence of boards is the lull before the storm.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jbgood: or bid 1 sp with 3+ (may be strong and 4) and 2 spades with 4 and an ordinay opener |pg||
nt|brolucius: When I watched the matching session on Friday, the hands were great. Or perhaps it is just that Helgemo/Helness made them look great. They were on screen most of the time. |pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|pc|sK|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|brolucius: Declarer is not too worried about a potential diamond ruff, because it would probably be with a natural trump trick.|pg||
nt|jbgood: and when they have not found the ruff - it is because there is none|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: Hampson's only worry is that trumps are 4-1. It's a little easier for us to see that they are not|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
nt|brolucius: The time spent playing a hand is inversely proportional to the level of the contract (Newton's 7th Law).|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d9|mc|9|nt|Walddk2: End of round 3, shutting down|pg||
