mb|p|nt|vugraphzps: Hi welcome to Las Vegas again|pg||
nt|Jacki: Were starting the tournament with the John Roberts Teams.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Jacki: This is an invitational event, with 16 teams competing; the entry fee is a modest $US 10,000 p|pg||
pc|h5|nt|petergill: Bobby Levin and Steve Weinstein are current Vanderbilt champions, and could go for the highest price in tonight's Cavendish Pairs auction (unless Helgemo - Helness or Rodwell - ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Hampson do)|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT 15-17|pg||
nt|jlrice: are you sure?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|henryb: we seem to be specializing in French teams in the early going|pg||
nt|petergill: No|pg||
nt|jlrice: that would make Gluboks pass very conservative|pg||
nt|jlrice: i would guess 14-16|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jlrice: should be a fairly boring 4H here   will make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|Jacki: Awards for this and all the Cavendish events will be posted on the website as they become available.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c presumably showed diamonds, and 3NT was a good practical effort|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Jacki: The scoring is IMPs, converted to Victory Points.|pg||
nt|Jacki: There will be three 9-board matches per session, two sessions today and one Thursday.|pg||
nt|Jacki: Thank you for joining us, and we hope you enjoy the events.|pg||
nt|dburn: aggressive sort of overcall, that|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: fast claim|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dburn: the thing here may be to avoid seven, rather than to get to six|pg||
nt|jlrice: yes  vulnerable  it is  but wanted to make sure his partner knows what to lead if they play NT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jlrice: 5@d was a good sacrifice   as it turns out they pushed glubok one level too high|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|petergill: Steve Weinstein is probably the most prolific winner of the Cavendish Pairs, with over 5 wins I think|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzps: Welcome all back|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jlrice: they can try for the uppercut but with 3-3 trumps will not work|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jlrice: with levin holding all the cards other than the J of clubs they will probably make 3|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn: but East has not shown heart length, so West will not place him with such as @hQJxx, opposite which seven would be cold|pg||
nt|jlrice: i dont know NS range but would you open S hand 1NT?|pg||
nt|dburn: I would not myself - the hand lends itself fairly easily to natural bidding|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|Jacki: World Bridge Productions, in cooperation with BBO, is proud to present the 35th Annual Cavendish Invitational.|pg||

nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jlrice: the only problem is on this auction  i might feel obligated to bid 2N with south hand instead of passing 2D|pg||
nt|dburn: but I expect there will be a number of 1NT openings around the room|pg||
nt|jlrice: I would open 1NT  but I believe in opening 1NT whenever I consider it a reasonable bid|pg||

pc|hA|nt|jlrice: the website for this event is http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jlrice: at the other table pepsi did not want to raise partner with stiff K   |pg||
nt|dburn: correct here is to cash a high spade in West, to cater for @sJxxx in either hand|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jlrice: yes  with T9x of diamonds Lall had no interest in going further after the 6@d bid|pg||
nt|dburn: but I expect Hamman learned that sort of thing a while or so ago|pg||

nt|dburn: minor-suit game or slam if that is best|pg||

nt|dburn: same contract at the other table, so no swing - as one would expect at this level of play|pg||
nt|dburn: Weinstein chose 1@d and struggled unsuccessfully in 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Chris Compton could safely play for the overtrick(s), with virtually no chance of going down|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: what can we learn from all of this?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jlrice: hi everyone|pg||
mb|d|nt|jlrice: very aggressive X here by joel|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|petergill: Most experts open very light in 3rd seat with a good suit, especially when not vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: superficially North-South have only three losers in a spade contract, but that club blockage may be awkward|pg||
nt|dburn: and getting to spades at all may not be so easy now, although it would not be totally absurd for Bompis to bid them|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, at some other vulnerabilities he might barely have overcalled in them|pg||
nt|jlrice: quantin could easily have spades since he didnt preempt or open 1C    so probably had a reason not to|pg||
mb|2C|nt|dburn: that's not "aggressive" - that's downright rabid|pg||
nt|dburn: he did bid them|pg||
nt|kit: easy 3NT contract, but the light 1@D opening may create complications|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: would a X of 3D have been penalty  |pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|jlrice: yes   i thought Hurd would leave it in  but pulled to 3H|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Levin "do you want to know about our leads"?|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: if Piekarek is convinced by all of this, he may save in five diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: from his point of view, his opponents have a considerable black-suit fit with nothing breaking badly for them|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: top of nothing|pg||
nt|dburn: but he might have bid 4@d over 3@s - I'm not quite sure why he felt he should reject his partner's 3@d try|pg||
nt|kit: Compton afraid his Qxx of diamonds might not be enough for notrump, so he reasonably hedges|pg||
mb|2N|nt|dburn: still, he has done the right thing|pg||
nt|jlrice: i agree    i wouldnt want to bid 5@d now     i could have raised to 4 and let partner decide|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: everyone leads high from doubletons  :)|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@s doubled would have been a precarious business - it would probably go down a trick|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@h is not a percarious business - it is a hopeless case|pg||
nt|jlrice: but at least you arent trying to beat game at the 2 level|pg||
nt|jlrice: defense could have problems if they dont switch to hearts|pg||
nt|jlrice: but i dont think will be a problem|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - they had better make sure they play a second round of diamonds|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jlrice: Hamman made an aggressive overcall here   I usually dont like overcalling 1nt on flat minimums|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: would have worked well for Lall to guess to use "garbage Stayman" and bail out into 2@s|pg||
nt|dburn: but his decision to pass is normal enough - just unfortunate on this occasion|pg||
nt|jlrice: he was probably afraid of the 2@D bid |pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid, right-siding @DQ|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|jlrice: not the best of leads   gives up an extra heart trick but they were never going to set this contract anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: but a hearth shift won't hurt for the moment|pg||
nt|jlrice: they needed to start hearts and when they get in with spade will force the ruff to set |pg||
nt|dburn: well, diamonds would have forced dummy just as effectively|pg||
nt|jlrice: they could play 2 diamonds but when they knock out spade ace would then have to play on hearts or else declarer could just duck a club if they forced a second ruff|pg||
nt|kit: yes, they did right-side it -- although from other side would have made also|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn: mind you, it may not be so hopeless now|pg||
nt|dburn: Hurd has made a pretty good fist of it, and Levin might have needed to shift to a club there|pg||
nt|kit: play should go pretty quickly|pg||
pc|h9|nt|dburn: Pepsi did opt for Stayman at the other table, but 2@s didn't quite fetch|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|jlrice: i still think he is short a trick|pg||
nt|jlrice: nope my mistake    GIB is so useful|pg||
nt|dburn: I'm not so sure|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D followed by 2NT suggested a dodgier (i.e more dubious) @D stopper than a direct 2NT over 2@C|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|c9|pg||
pc|h7|nt|atlantajon: another @d?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jlrice: they are still going to have to lose a spade and a diamond for down 2|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jlrice: and a push|pg||
nt|dburn: if he draws trumps, ruffs a diamond and plays a club to the jack, what can Levin do?|pg||

nt|vugraphzps: Current Standings http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/2009/TEAMS1-FINALS.htm|pg||
nt|jlrice: no  just needed for W not to switch to diamond when he was in|pg||
nt|dburn: and that will be 8 IMPs for Rogoff, somewhat randomly|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|atlantajon: there will be some action here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dburn: so Goren can chalk up 6 IMPs for aggressive bidding, skilful play and a large slice of old-fashioned luck|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jlrice: i am not sure what 3D is?|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps a sound three-card raise|pg||
nt|jlrice: could be   might have also just had a diamond in with his hearts as well  |pg||
mb|3C|nt|petergill: Scores after 6 matches are at http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/2009/TEAMS2-FINALS.htm. I think Round 7 scores are not yet posted.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jlrice: 6H is a good contract   all of Ns values are working and hands fit well together|pg||
nt|kit: the 3@C call has a wide range here in most partnerships|pg||
nt|jlrice: it could have gotten them too high    |pg||
nt|jlrice: but after 3H i would guess that NS is playing the contract wherever they want Xed|pg||
nt|kit: Levin took a stab at a heart fit with diamonds in reserve -- but still risky|pg||
mb|5C|nt|reisig: oops|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: Weinstein is going to face an unenviable guess here|pg||
nt|jlrice: 3NT not a good contract but joel will need to find spade|pg||
nt|dburn: he needs to play on hearts before clubs to have any chance|pg||
nt|dburn: a question of guessing which side ace West holds, so as to knock that out first|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Dbl works well|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: 1@h was a transfer, showing 4-5 @s|pg||
nt|jlrice: are they playing a strong club system?|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|po-s: D2 lead would make life difficult but we won´t see that|pg||
nt|atlantajon: I was just thinking the same thing|pg||
nt|atlantajon: even now it is good|pg||
nt|atlantajon: Hello PO.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: I would guess that too much time has passed to fool Jeff with the 2@d now.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: he would get it right..|pg||
nt|atlantajon: a play like that needs to be in tempo.  win the A@h and lead the 2@d right away.|pg||
nt|jlrice: conservative pass by weinstein    a lot of people might invite with his hand   but does entice the opponents to come into the auction where they may go for a number|pg||
nt|kit: Glubok believed that his partner had a stiff diamond apparently|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dburn: well done indeed|pg||
nt|petergill: 300, or perhaps even 500, is possible here|pg||
nt|jlrice: or maybe just a better hand in general|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein might well have doubled this -- odds are that dummy won't have sufficient entries to take the needed club finesses|pg||
nt|petergill: I'm not a big fan of good-bad 2NT , but it would have worked well here|pg||
nt|petergill: since then the weakness of the 3@C rebid would be known|pg||
nt|kit: oh sorry, he did double -- wasn't paying attention|pg||
nt|kit: at least Weinstein was|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jlrice: wrong guess|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|henryb: apparently, since Zimmerman bid game|pg||
nt|dburn: but this isn't so good|pg||
nt|jlrice: he can switch to hearts now  and hope that suit plays for one loser|pg||
nt|dburn: in truth, he probably needed to play a heart from the dummy at the second trick|pg||
nt|dburn: a play that would be impossible without having seen the hand records in advance|pg||
nt|kit: now he can win ace of diamonds, shift to heart, and get heart ruff -- seems reasonable|pg||
nt|kit: jack of diamonds perhaps better play -- clarifying location of king of diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: I think they play 3/5 leads, so the play was safe.  Would not have been safe with 4th best leads|pg||
nt|petergill: Play of 3@HX would be very interesting - @C ruffed, heart ducked to queen, West cannot profitably attack clubs ... 3@hX might have even made for 730!   |pg||
pc|h6|nt|jlrice: they did well to get there and will pick up 11 imps for their effort|pg||
nt|Jacki: http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/ For Kibbers Info|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb: how would he make 4@s after a trump shift, a @d to the A and another trump? Isn't he a trick short?|pg||
nt|henryb: maybe not|pg||
nt|po-s: a few club ruff might help|pg||
nt|henryb: he can establish the fifth club|pg||
nt|po-s: ruffS|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: fast claim|pg||
nt|dburn: best for one loser in the spade suit is to begin with the ace|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jlrice: glubok will go down 2 or 3   but not doubled so wont be a bad score|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|petergill: Brian Glubok didn't dbl 3@H because he thought the 6-3 or 7-3 club fit negated playing for penalties|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, NS lead 3/5th|pg||
nt|kit: and he was afraid of the double fit -- and rightly so|pg||
nt|kit: the real problem was the wide range of the 3@C call -- Compton could have had a lot more|pg||
nt|kit: some partnerships play a version of good-bad 2NT here, which allows them to distinguish between a constructive rebid and a competitive rebid|pg||
nt|petergill: A world champion spec tells me that 3@HX would lose 4@H and 1@S - cannot quite hold it to 3 @H losers |pg||
nt|reisig: Compton knows everything abt this hand ...and not happy about|pg||
nt|kit: winning ace of hearts wasn't so clear -- might have been better to overtake and run queen of clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: She won the 2006 Rosenblum Cup, so I believe her|pg||
nt|kit: at any rate, winning ace of hearts and thinking can't be right -- he should have known what he was going to do before winning ace of hearts|pg||
nt|petergill: @DJ was a nice play at Trick 1|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|dburn: at the other table, East attempted to apply pressure with a raise to 4@d|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dburn: with about an 85% chance of collecting three tricks|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jlrice: he might havev just played a heart thinking diamonds could easily be 6-3   and just tried to steal his 9th trick|pg||
nt|jlrice: i definitely would not suggest balancing with comptons hand though very little upside with partner a passed hand|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein hs things well under control here -- he knows the whole hand basically|pg||
nt|jlrice: nice duck of spade   weinstein knows he cant pull all trumps|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jlrice: in clubs|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dburn: South doubled in fear and trembling, and must have felt like buying North a very large drink for bidding hearts and not spades|pg||
nt|jlrice: not likely to make anything given he was balanced 10 count|pg||
pc|cT|nt|petergill: The careful defence has ensured 500|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|henryb: usually 2@s over 1@h is a minimum with 4@s -- this auction is stronger|pg||

nt|jlrice: nice play by glubok to throw in weinstein and force him to lead away from his Q of hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: or it was, until declarer cashed the ace of spades|pg||

mb|p|nt|dburn: still, no great harm befell him|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|petergill: Bd 12: Rodwell's strong club system at the other table allowed EW to clarify strength early and avoid problems at the other table|pg||
nt|petergill: EW play a 15-17 1NT opening|pg||
nt|kit: a preemptive 3@D would be more to my liking on Compton's hand -- he'll never sell to 2@H anyway, so why not go right to 3@D and make life difficult for opponents|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dburn: some Norths might venture an overcall, but they would struggle to get out for down one if they did|pg||
nt|petergill: How many hearts?|pg||
nt|jlrice: just 3|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|henryb: every one has their own methods. some would play 2@h there as 6+ spades and 8+ points|pg||
nt|po-s: ew can make 4D|pg||
nt|henryb: N-S can make 3N :)|pg||
nt|kit: Now Levin can make a Q-bid game try.  Over 3@D, that wouldn't have been available and Levin would have to guess how many hearts to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|atlantajon: n/s can make 3nt|pg||
nt|atlantajon: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Kit's poiint is very good - as usual|pg||
nt|kit: They will defeat this a trick, it looks like -- but 4@h down 2 (doubled?) would be even better|pg||
nt|jlrice: but with balanced hand and soft values I wouldnt jump to 4 with Norths hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: hard to believe Levin is really contemplating bidding 4@H here|pg||
nt|reisig: Is he really considering 4@h now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: If 4@H is bid, a spec dbl by Brian Glubok with his three aces is possible|pg||

nt|dburn: still, the tendency to come in over 1NT is not so strong at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|jlrice: but after that lead doesnt matter    both tables led the same|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will eventually strip the hand and lead a spade to the 9 for down 1, I believe|pg||
pc|dA|nt|atlantajon: I bet Jeff is wishing he bid 3nt now.|pg||
nt|jlrice: with a diamond lead  this will be a fast contract will just hook the club |pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jlrice: and claim|pg||
pc|h4|nt|henryb: Interesting question whether to overcall 1@h or 1@d. If you are on defense you want a @h lead. If you think you may want to play the hand you have more @d, so that is likely to be ...|pg||
nt|henryb: a better trump suit|pg||
nt|dburn: that may have cost declarer a tempo|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jlrice: mahaffey overcalled 1@h instead of 1@d   gets partner to lead your better suit    but tough to get to 3@d|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|dburn: but only if South shifts to clubs, and that is a rather tough defense for him to find|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|henryb: notice that N-S can make 3@d|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jlrice: Hurd is playing the suit the only way to make extra tricks    if they are 3-3     |pg||
pc|hA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jlrice: weinstein will probably have to get hearts correct to make this|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jlrice: at the other table N came into the bidding and EW found it was hard to stop|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer reluctant to play a club, since he'll go a lot down if the king loses to the ace|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jlrice: also your hearts are strong enough that if they have game a heart overcall could scare them out of 3NT thinking you might have 5 hearts off top|pg||
nt|jlrice: if he doesnt overtake Levin would just duck 1 round and will only be able to take 1 spade|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|dburn: but he has bitten the bullet, and found that it was made of candy after all|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s3|pc|h8|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|petergill: Declarer knows from West's non-1S response that East has exactly 4 spades, so there's no line to try to make 3@h, hence will play safe for -1|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: meanwhile, at the other table East-West did a lot of bidding, with the result that they lost a lot of IMPs|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|petergill: Website is http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/ for Results go to Event Information and scroll down|pg||
mb|p|nt|atlantajon: wow|pg||
nt|dburn: O'Rourke started this event very well, but this is going to be a setback for her|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Levin fails to put the pressure on, giving Glubok a chance to limit his hand|pg||
nt|jlrice: yes  i would bid 3D the first time|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, I mean Session Information and scroll down|pg||
nt|kit: And now Levin expect heart shortness in his partner's hand, so he bids -- unlucky|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|jlrice: this will make due to very fortunate trump position|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|dburn: even 3@s is a bit high for comfort, since 3@d was probably going down|pg||
nt|kit: However, I do believe that Glubok should have doubled -- they just don't figure to make with both of them being passed hands|pg||
nt|petergill: Brian Glubok underleads more aces than most experts - he likes to try decepive plays|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dburn: same auction at the other table, a routine sequence|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jlrice: should be a good lead for defense   will start to cut ties between hands  |pg||

pc|h7|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|jlrice: but with nice club and heart layout   can not go wrong on this hand|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dburn: still, as things are it will win an IMP for Faiegnbaum|pg||
nt|jlrice: have you seen some of compton's openings     Levin might have an opening hand and just didnt have a hand to do something over 1H|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|dburn: still, whatever declarer does is going to work|pg||
nt|jlrice: yes  he will have to take either heart or spade finesse and both work|pg||
nt|dburn: unless he is very trusting of the lead he may not take the spade finesse - that would strand dummy and the contract would be close to hopeless|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s5|nt|kit: I don't think he was trying to be deceptive -- he chose to lead his partner's suit, and having decided that, he simply thought leading low was percentage|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dburn: but he decided that Fu was an honest broker who would not lead the deuce from a bad suit|pg||

nt|jlrice: so a quicker duck would leave him less likely to have it|pg||
nt|kit: I definitely would have bid some number of diamonds initially -- maybe 3@D, probably 2@D|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, Match 7 results are still not there yet|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|atlantajon: very friendly @s position here.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|dburn: may be spades and a minor|pg||
nt|jlrice: probably|pg||
nt|petergill: I don't like 3@D with xxx in RHO's suit|pg||
nt|kit: xxx is bad, but the hand is otherwise pure -- so not clear|pg||
mb|2D!|an|4!hs|nt|dburn: one wonders what Zhao will do now|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@h not a terrible contract for North-South, but going to be tricky on this lie of cards|pg||
nt|dburn: 3NT likewise|pg||
nt|dburn: although in the abstract 3NT is a very terrible contract|pg||
nt|dburn: but East may not lead a diamond - or West may save in his partner's minor|pg||
nt|jlrice: yes  in order for it to be good you need a non diamond lead and a good club break|pg||
nt|dburn: having sad that, what sort of a "save" is 4@d?|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe the defenders can force the East hand, to prevent the establishment of spades|pg||
nt|jlrice: wth everything breaking the way it is   it is a very good "save"|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb: with the favorable @h and @s positions 6@h can be made, but it is not a good contract|pg||
nt|dburn: now, what do you suppose that means?|pg||
nt|dburn: lead a spade? lead your minor?|pg||
nt|jlrice: now hurd will bid 4@d i think   |pg||
nt|kit: this is probably 4-card drury|pg||
nt|petergill: Is Glubok right to be silent at this vulnerabilty with his bad long @d suit?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzps: those 2@c where alerted|pg||
nt|dburn: at the other table, South tried 2@s in this auction|pg||
nt|dburn: considerate of East not to double 2@h at the other table|pg||
nt|kit: Unclear whether Compton's double is diamonds or just takeout of hearts -- could be either with his hand|pg||
mb|5D|nt|dburn: and North carried him all the way to 6@s|pg||
nt|petergill: Good save found|pg||
mb|d|nt|jlrice: i would take it as lead a spade with my partner   dont know how they play it|pg||
nt|dburn: we may be about to find out|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein will probably double and end the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but if he does not lead a diamond, there is now a pretty good case for Levin to get the clubs right|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlrice: he has to hook at trick 2 |pg||
nt|petergill: Bad hand for using 2@D as Drury, as it turns out|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb: in fact I guess Deep finesse would say that N-S can make 7@h|pg||
nt|atlantajon: this must be a coded lead.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: or rusinow|pg||
nt|jlrice: i am a little aggressive with the bid but i like leaping michaels with N|pg||
nt|dburn: or at least, North carried him to 5@h - South then decided that since his spades might have been three small, his possession of @sA entitled him to bid a slam|pg||
nt|dburn: which would have made on a good day, if the 2@h opener had held the king of diamonds rather than hearts, say|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed he does, and that is of course a huge play|pg||
nt|dburn: but if he finds it, he will repair more than half the damage done to O'Rourke in the last few boards|pg||
nt|kit: why?  Compton could have made takeout bid over any Drury call|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jlrice: might even make 7   but i would be happy to be in 4   wouldnt want to be in slam|pg||
nt|jlrice: yes    will win 15 i think if he does it  (i dont know scores that well)|pg||
nt|jlrice: 5@c is the winning contract on this board but tough to get to unless you open 1@c|pg||
nt|jlrice: even then it isnt so easy|pg||
nt|dburn: still, no one ever doubles anyone these days|pg||
nt|jlrice: i would not X either   |pg||
nt|dburn: largely because [a] partner never has anything when he opens the bidding and [b] double is always for takeout anyway|pg||
nt|jlrice: i dont want to hang partner  if he has bad hand  |pg||
nt|jlrice: it would have been for penalty though   he could have Xed the first time for takeout|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|atlantajon: on the @c lead you can easily|pg||
nt|dburn: today was not a good day, though, so that slam was two down, and if the defense here minds its work it can pick up 7 IMPs|pg||
nt|jlrice: i would play the X as diamonds at the table but   looks like it was takeout given his hand so would have Xed 2C as well|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dburn: well done|pg||
nt|jlrice: nice play|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H P 2@S fit-showing would have got the job done with less chance of letting EW into the auction |pg||
nt|kit: However you play the double, it is vital that partner knows what it means -- partnership agreements like this are vital|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kit: it also might have gotten them to 3@H down 1 on a different layout|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|dburn: he will score 950 for this, which will indeed be 15 IMPs|pg||
nt|dburn: if opening the bidding on a bad hand were a hanging offence, there would be precious few bridge players left alive|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|po-s: good jack by Barry|pg||
nt|atlantajon: for the KIBS that are asking.....Rusinow leads are the lead of the second of touching cards.   the 9 shows the 10....the Q shows the K...etc.|pg||
nt|po-s: Club to king and club most likely - if North turns up with queen he will duck|pg||
nt|atlantajon: unless north plays the Q@c.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: then duck it|pg||
nt|po-s: if he ducks a club to South he is down|pg||
nt|atlantajon: as an avoidance type play.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: only duck if the Q is played.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: otherwise you are correct I think|pg||
nt|po-s: I think that´s what I said|pg||
nt|henryb: doen't he have 9 tricks by losing a @s|pg||
nt|atlantajon: it may be 2/4th.|pg||

nt|dburn: ...Wooldrige pitches his hearts, in which case he will score 1150 and 16 IMPs|pg||
nt|jlrice: joel was in tough spot   needed to throw either A or K of diamonds    but a small diamond would have probably done fine|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, Smirnov seems to have under-utilized his aces by a factor of 33%|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: most people will treat the hand the way glubok did as balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: Levin would cash out and give the last 3 tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: Well done by NS to find the club ruff and minimise any loss|pg||
mb|1D|nt|atlantajon: Limit raise by south?|pg||
nt|jlrice: i would XX showing points   otherwise just 1 level bump|pg||
nt|dburn: so that Quantin got out for down, one, and Faigenbaum added another couple of IMPs|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dburn: this is a slam, although you had better play in spades (at least in theory)|pg||
mb|d|nt|atlantajon: can the 1@C be right?|pg||
nt|jlrice: 6@d is a good contract     6@h is also good but can be set with diamond rough|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: 4333   and partner might not have full values for overcall|pg||
nt|jlrice: it isnt a very good 10 count   and would hate to go high quickly  might hang partner|pg||
nt|atlantajon: I agree Jon.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: he had 2 choices of Q bids there....I play the 2@d shows the weaker hand....while 2@h is the opening hand.|pg||
nt|dburn: not so easy to reach six of anything, but not entirely impossible|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jlrice: 3D was probably a mixed raise though|pg||
nt|atlantajon: How do you play the Jump Q Jon?|pg||
nt|jlrice: i would play as mixed normally|pg||
nt|jlrice: i dont like coming into this auction with S hand   too many times you will get Xed and have very few tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: Lev and Pszczola could not manage it given a free run|pg||
nt|dburn: and despite West being able to show his hand pretty well|pg||
nt|dburn: and you had better get the trumps right, which is not so easy on the bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: but if Weinstein jumps to six diamonds, as well he might, Hurd is not going to lead a spade|pg||
mb|2S|nt|henryb: N-S are now in a gf with no game to be made|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT is Ok, 5@C isn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but Levin will still have to play the spades to advantage|pg||
nt|kit: Glubok thinks there will be more bidding, so time to show his club suit later|pg||
mb|p|nt|atlantajon: As would I....but that gives him 3 choices of 4 card raises.|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, Lall appears to have had no difficulty at all|pg||
nt|dburn: one argument for doubling these contracts is that at least if gets you to focus properly on the defence|pg||
mb|3C|nt|dburn: and there is a case for playing to the king, given that East is more or less marked with the ace and with long clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not so much a free run as a flying leap|pg||
nt|dburn: however, Levin may be able to discover that East has two cards in each red suit|pg||
nt|kit: I think Compton will quit|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT or 4@C is tempting, but perhaps the major suit cards look to slow opposite 6-4 in the minors? |pg||
mb|3S|nt|dburn: and count him for 3=2=2=6 shape|pg||
nt|petergill: too slow, meaning too slow to take tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: not very tempting -- the fact that opponents haven't raised spades indicates that partner has 2 spades and 1 heart -- not other way around.  Big difference.|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S = good raise to 4@C, considering the context that I did pass 2@S. |pg||
nt|jlrice: given glubok bid 2D and then 3C the weakest way to show this hand   i would pass    he could have bid 2C then 3D to show stronger hand with similar distribution|pg||
nt|kit: I think he means 3@S as notrump try -- if just interested in clubs, he would simply bid 4@C|pg||
nt|petergill: Less tempting for me since I can see all 52 cards. |pg||
mb|4D|nt|jlrice: i generally play neg free bids though so 2D might not have support|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: 3@d game try in @s|pg||
nt|henryb: I assume Goren stretched to open a forcing 1@c|pg||
nt|atlantajon: that is what I think.|pg||
nt|jlrice: yes opps helped out by forcing them to just guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|atlantajon: but it is a big upgrade.|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|atlantajon: there is not much play here.  with the A@h offside.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|petergill: Trying to get to a right-sided 3NT if partner has Kx or Ax in 1@S = smart thinking?|pg||
nt|kit: I think I can guess what Weinstein's first three plays will be|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|atlantajon: 2/3 of the hand is in AJ AJ....|pg||
nt|po-s: the alternative is that he pulled the wrong card...|pg||
nt|atlantajon: that is posible.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: possible|pg||
nt|henryb: also possible|pg||
pc|s7|nt|dburn: facing a one-level opening bid rather than a weak two bid, and being forced to guess over 5@c, Lall's action was brave but reasonable - however....|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|dburn: though he may not have enough entries to cash three rounds of hearts and lead spades twice towards dummy|pg||
nt|dburn: at any rate, he isn't troubling with any of that, and Hurd has probably dwelt too long already on his play to this trick|pg||
nt|petergill: @S7 = normal count|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|dburn: still, Levin may conceivably go wrong now|pg||
nt|jlrice: at least he is forcing him to guess now   if he waited til later he definitely would get the information to get it right|pg||
nt|jlrice: but should hook or hurd probably would have ducked with Ax|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he might have done|pg||
nt|jlrice: he could have been afraid of getting endplayed later though|pg||
nt|dburn: but then declarer, if he were 3=3=5=2, could put up the king, eliminate hearts and clubs from the East hand, and play a spade|pg||
nt|dburn: still, West is very likely to be short in something - he did bid 5@c, vulnerable against not|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Levin is showing his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: This is my hand he said|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: still thinking|pg||

nt|kit: East thought he was strong enough to drive to game -- and I agree.  It was West who overbid IMO.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: ...on reflection Hamman might feel that he ought to have played the 5@c bidder for a void rather than the 2@c bidder|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: NS stole the contract here   5H can be made EW|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dburn: twelve tricks at the other table looks a fine achievement|pg||
nt|dburn: at this one, 1NT is four spades and a longer minor|pg||
nt|jlrice: yes   E ducked his diamond twice|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT = 4 card major and 5+ minor I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: another chance for Levin to shine and for O'Rourke to gain a big swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: should be a big swing to zimmerman|pg||
nt|atlantajon: I would think so.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: even if they defend 4@s it is surely going to be X'd.|pg||
nt|jlrice: at the other table  auction went 3@s-4@s  and Lev didnt want to come in with W hand|pg||
nt|atlantajon: east thinking about slam??|pg||
nt|atlantajon: he has a good hand for @H contract.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: and his partner freely bid 4@h.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: the 3 small @s's is actually a good thing.|pg||
nt|jlrice: the problem with coming in is that you could be going for 800  if you partner has nothing   but you could be giving up a game swing if he has the right cards|pg||
nt|po-s: more fun if Weswt had played a spade after the hearts. Declarer would have taken his spades, then overtaken the clubs to produce one more undertrick|pg||
nt|jlrice: he might have figured he needed the void in order to overcall that horrible hand|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C = "pass, or correct to 2@D"|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c = to play in the minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: over 4S|pg||
nt|po-s: dangerous...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jlrice: especially after jumper led Ace|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 16: I think there was a strong inference that West had a singleton 1D (no 3@d bid over 2@S) so that @DKJ were wasted|pg||
nt|petergill: singleton @D|pg||
nt|kit: Tough opening lead here for Compton -- I have no idea what is percentage, but his choice is certainly reasonable.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|po-s: or two|pg||
nt|dburn: or perhaps Weinstein will become declarer at six clubs|pg||
nt|jlrice: just need to get clubs correct for 6 to make   |pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn: indeed, but if South really were void in diamonds, he would almost certainly have had a few spades, and might have entered the auction with a double and not an overcall|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|po-s: In the other room it was strongly suggested that West should bid 5H over 2S-4S|pg||
nt|atlantajon: looks like the doubleton 10@c makes this hand....a place for the @h loser.|pg||
nt|dburn: though 6NT is probably where you would like to play|pg||
nt|jlrice: they have wrong sided diamonds so that a club lead can beat them  |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|dburn: but that may not be easy to discover|pg||
pc|hT|nt|atlantajon: 4@s does look like kickback.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|atlantajon: 2 with the Q?|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure what this bidding means|pg||
nt|jlrice: not exactly sure myself |pg||
nt|petergill: 11 tricks look inevitable|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jlrice: i would take it that way   but 5@d would show 2 without then so not|pg||
nt|po-s: Well, what would East have done if West "freely" bids 5H?|pg||
nt|dburn: but that was a 25-IMP decision - 13 for Mahaffey instead of 12 for Hamman|pg||
nt|dburn: but if Weinstein converts to six diamonds, Wooldrige may double|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|henryb: losing a trick in each suit?|pg||
nt|dburn: and then it will be up to someone to convert to 6NT|pg||
nt|kit: The king of diamonds almost always cashes in this layout|pg||
pc|d9|nt|dburn: but no one did|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|jlrice: but i would play 4@s as kickback and 4NT as spade Q|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h7|nt|dburn: here Fu, who had no tenaces to protect, decided to led Zhao become declarer|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|atlantajon: That is why I had the ? on it.|pg||
nt|po-s: he will try to find South with Qxx of clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: According to Kit Woolsey's software (I think), leading from A10xx is OK - it is leading from AJxx that often backfires, if I recall correctly. Correct me if I'm wrong. |pg||
pc|c3|nt|petergill: Declarer correctly is knocking out @DA before the 2nd round of trumps|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|henryb: I guess he can set up the fourth heart and fall back on the @c finesse if that dows not work|pg||
nt|po-s: why not|pg||
nt|atlantajon: I think he will look for 3-3 @H first.  then fall back on the @c hook.|pg||
nt|kit: compton now knows where the queen of diamonds is, but he doesn't know how many -- winning ace of diamonds would preserve entry to partner's long heart on this hand, but too risky|pg||
nt|kit: they both are very risky -- but AJxx more risky|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|kit: Now Compton will be end-played again|pg||
nt|kit: he can't cash diamond as it sets up the long diamonds, and when he doesn't cash he will be thrown in with ace of diamonds|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jlrice: wont matter though  all resaonable plays lead to -1|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|po-s: sorry, thought he had three losers before handling clubs and - or hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: just in case Zhao did have something that needed protection (such as the heart king)|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
mc|6|nt|kit: he sees this coming, so just establishes his club trick for down 1|pg||

nt|vugraphzps: Ok last board of this match, will be back in about 20 minutes with the 3th match of this session|pg||
nt|po-s: with only two it is clearly superior to go for hearts first|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: lasst board of this first session, hope to see all back at 1600 hrs vegas time, 1900 NYC time for  the second session|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: last board of this round, we will be back tomorow at 1030 vegas time, 1330 nyc time|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Last board of this round, will be back in some minutes with round 8, hope to see you all here :)|pg||
nt|jlrice: yes if he didnt someone could win the A of first diamond and then finish drawing trumps to set   on a different lie of the cards|pg||
nt|kit: key would have been to win ace of diamonds on first or second round, but that would be very bad on other layouts|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Last board of this round! We will be back after a little break for the last round of  the team event|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|dburn: again the Chinese are putting pressure on by jumping to the five level|pg||
nt|jlrice: this is a lively board   seamon took out insurance by bidding 7D at other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: next match in some minutes, hope to see you all here|pg||
nt|dburn: at the other table, declarer in 6@d by South received a heart lead, so he ruffed a heart, drew trumps and led a low club to his queen|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but if they sell out to 6@s, that might give declarer the clue he needs to get the trumps right|pg||
nt|dburn: a line of play that was not at all best, and met the fate it deserved|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dburn: of course, Zhao might take out insurance himself|pg||
nt|petergill: Exciting hand here, with slam possible. |pg||
nt|jlrice: yes 6@C can be made|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but if he passes slowly, there will be some pressure on Fu|pg||
nt|dburn: and he will be a much-relieved man to find that he has gained a couple of IMPs instead of losing a million|pg||
nt|petergill: Smirnov - Piekarek came 4th in the World Championship in Beijing last year, playing for Germany. |pg||
nt|petergill: Some experts would respond 2@C, not 1@H, to the 1@d opening. |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|jlrice: partner would have tough decision on bumping to 6   if he is willing to try for slam on this auction surely he would bump to 6 on 3s P 4S 5H|pg||
nt|dburn: and if he doubles... well, maybe that is one of these non-penalty slam doubles, but there is some danger here|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: the X was alerted|pg||
nt|dburn: still, Hamman's pass to 6@d more or less confirms his void, so that Fu is likely to save anyway|pg||
nt|jlrice: i think bidding 7 should be done    you arent going to do worse than game their way|pg||
nt|jlrice: i would respond 2@C   lets partner know we have game and it is my longest suit|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C now ... then perhaps 4@H preference - I'm just guessing|pg||
nt|jlrice: plus more likely to keep opps out of auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|jlrice: good lead by mahaffey   need  to get club ruff off top to set|pg||
nt|atlantajon: all roads lead to 12 tricks....13 if they miss leading the @c.|pg||
nt|jlrice: the 4@s sac did not do so well in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Weinstein might have raised to 2@S -- either call okay|pg||
mb|3S|nt|po-s: which card should East play?|pg||
nt|reisig: end with a flat board|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well done by Fu - now Lall has to avoid bidding seven himself|pg||
nt|petergill: Due to the expected spade intervention, given his void and the prevailing vulnerabilty, West preferred to get his hearts into the auction early, before the inevitable spade ...|pg||
nt|petergill: preemption.|pg||
nt|petergill: East has a guess now - he might bid 5NT = pick a slam |pg||
mb|4S|nt|dburn: 2NT some form of "good-bad" - 3@d instead would have shown a good hand|pg||
nt|kit: Levin has to be thinking slam possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: which would have led to 6@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: so the French win the match on the last board|pg||
nt|jlrice: as it turns out slam is on a finesse or a good diamond break   assuming a trump lead  so cant fault them for not bidding it|pg||
nt|petergill: The next match is due not long after this match finishes|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to our operator Catalina Robles for a good job. |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: unless of course he bids seven hearts, which he could make, but that is not really on the menu|pg||
nt|kit: But Weinstein makes no move at all, so forget it|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jlrice: this wont be easiest contract to defend|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, pass was alos an option - East did have fair defence against hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: still, if he makes it, he will be forgiven|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Last hand of this round, we will be back in some minutes with round 6, last one of today|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: he has only four obvious losers, but he has got to do something with those hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: and I'm not sure he can do enough with all of them|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D game-forcing checkback I think|pg||
nt|kit: 2D was GF checkback, right|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jlrice: depends on opponents carding i would say|pg||
nt|po-s: ok, standard|pg||
nt|jlrice: if they play udca i would play high   standard  low|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||

nt|atlantajon: We start back at 7pm eastern time.  |pg||
nt|atlantajon: :)|pg||
nt|atlantajon: hope to see everyone then.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|po-s: seems hard to deal with the five|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, Levin may have to let Weinstein ruff this|pg||
nt|dburn: rather than putting up the king|pg||
nt|jlrice: levin needs to duck |pg||
nt|dburn: still, at least he knows that the lead was a singleton|pg||
nt|dburn: since it was the @h3 and the !2 is in dummy|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|jlrice: if they play standard you play low   his partner will know he has odd|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|jlrice: on a diamond lead will have no problems making this   needed to start clubs immiediately to have shot at setting|pg||
mc|11|nt|jlrice: yes   why play a different fit when you already have a known 11 card fit|pg||
nt|kit: they did well to stop low after the very light opening bid|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to Catalina Robles for a great job as operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Thanks all, will be back soon|pg||
nt|petergill: The John Roberts Teams is named after the late John Roberts, a bridge expert who held a rock concert called Woodstock then later in 1997 (with Bob Blanchard I think) started up ...|pg||
nt|petergill: World Bridge Productions which moved the Cavendish to Las Vegas and turned it into an annual million dollar bridge event|pg||
nt|petergill: O'Rourke after 8 of the 9 rounds leads on 175 VP. Zaleski has 138 after 8 matches, Mahaffey has 131 after 7 rounds and Kasle 120 after 7 rounds|pg||
nt|petergill: Play resumes soon|pg||
nt|petergill: O'Rourke do not seem to have played Mahaffey yet, so there's a big chance that we will see O'Rourke vs Mahaffey in the last match soon|pg||
nt|petergill: First prize is $43,750. Just 9 boards to go. O'Rourke on 175 VP lead the event fairly comfoitably|pg||
