nt|lc: They sold for $24,000 -- their investor can't be pleased.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|lc: N-S were in 8th place.|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|lc: A very light opening bid -- but 3 10's.|pg||
nt|dburn:  in the Maastricht Olympiad I once went to get a drink of water, came back to the wrong table, sat down at it and made my international debut for Uruguay|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|lc: The "Swedish" way these days is to transfer after 1@C openings -- very popular.|pg||
nt|petergill: Odin Svendsen is a great player from Norway according to my Norwegian friends, not well known outside Norway, and Boye Brogeland is a current World Champion. They are currently ...|pg||
nt|petergill: running last or thereabouts.  |pg||
mb|d|nt|lc: Since 1@H-@S, the 1@S is like a takeout double.|pg||
nt|lc: The DBL is prob support X (3@S)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: You need a decoder ring to watch "modern" bridge.|pg||
nt|petergill: Website is http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/ |pg||
nt|lc: And this event actually doesn't allow too much artificially.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lc: East could be out for blood here -- and may get it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: This will get doubled, for sure.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|lc: Nowhere to run.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Looks like 800 -- only the pair of ace-kings.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lc: So, a huge result for E-W here -- caused by the light opening.|pg||
nt|lc: I suspect a similar auction will occur at other tables (Even if East opens light, some Souths might overcall 1NT and get doubled).|pg||
nt|lc: So, plenty of 800's and the rest of the room in a partscore E-W.|pg||
nt|lc: This will give 200 or more cross-imps to E-W, I'd guess (unfortunately, they started the day -2,279 -- long way to go).|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Michel Bessis asking for the card of the opp|pg||
nt|lc: However, one year Marty Bergen and I were in dead last after Day 1 -- and won! -- it can happen.|pg||
nt|petergill: If you click on Session Information at http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/, you get info about the first two sessions, but nothing yet for this session|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Asking system to Brogeland|pg||
nt|lc: He can ask all the questions he wants.  He still has only a pair of aces and a pair of kings.|pg||
nt|lc: Would be better if he stepped down into the casino.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|lc: He will try to build a @C trick, but obviously nothing will work.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dburn:  no good - South only has sevens full of aces, but West has tens full of twos, so he would not win even at the casino|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|lc: :)|pg||
nt|lc: I doubt he didn't lay down the @CA first.  Is this right?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|lc: It is inconceivable to me that the defense can mess this up.  800 all day long.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h3|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|lc: Even though it worked out poorly, I agree with Michel's entry into the auction.|pg||
nt|lc: I blame North for having such a poor dummy.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|dburn:  might have worked better to double 1@h rather than bidding 1@s, but they may play that as showing 5+ hearts|pg||
nt|viren169: .|pg||
nt|lc: Sure - I suspect X = @H.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|davidstern: .|pg||
nt|lc: Most people play over X-fers that X="THat suit--the arif. suit" -- and bidding their shown suit is takeout.|pg||
nt|petergill: A big result for EW, with West doing well to open light, having many tens, and many other Souths will stay out of the auction on the featureless South hand  |pg||
nt|dburn:  as more and more players in Europe particularly are adopting transfer responses to 1@c, it is becoming important to organize a defense to the method|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|lc: After the 1@H overcall, will West have a way to show @D|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lc: Most in this field probably play 3@D as weak in comp.|pg||
nt|dburn:  and the Bessis partnership had one - but anything you do can turn out miserably sometimes, of course|pg||
nt|davidstern: 4@H only needs spade ace onside|pg||
nt|dburn:  some use 2@c as a transfer in this kind of auction|pg||
nt|viren169: Best defense (simple) defence is dbl= strong NT; cue=take-out; NT=minors|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dburn:  and some use 1@s as a negative double *without* four spades|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lc: With a @D lead, I think 4@H would have no legit play wherever @SA is.|pg||
nt|dburn:  which is what Brogeland may be doing here|pg||
nt|lc: Was 1@S alerted?  Maybe it is a psyche?|pg||
nt|petergill: I suspect EW play transfers here, so Dbl of 1@H = spades and 1@S = @d's|pg||
nt|viren169: If system is still on... 1@S=diamonds|pg||
nt|lc: I'd like that little alert box, then.   Vugraphzps says there was no alert.|pg||
nt|dburn:  as I say, it could be a negative double without spades (double would show 4 or 5 spades)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|petergill: This sort of things is quite common in some parts of the world|pg||
nt|davidstern: EW certainly play transfer responses|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: I didnt see any alert|pg||
mb|4H|nt|viren169: and 3@C is good raise in @H|pg||
mb|5D|nt|dburn:  or it could be diamonds, as it would be if South had not overcalled|pg||
nt|lc: Easy to overreach to 4@H, but natural for West to "save."|pg||
nt|dburn:  but now he has decided to reveal the true nature of his hand, doubtless to his partner's delight|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|lc: Right, I doubt East is smiling.  This must be how it went all day yesterday to get them into last place.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: One of Boye's Brogeland's some-time partners confirmed my explanation of 1@S privately|pg||
nt|lc: So, surely 1@S meant something -- or East would not have bid this way.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lc: So, 1@S did mean @D.  It sure looks like he has @D :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dburn:  better duck this|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lc: No way to stop the @S ruff -- duck or not.|pg||
nt|dburn:  but the defence could still organize a ruff|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|lc: So, with the ruff, this will be -500.  A phantom save.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|d6|pc|s9|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|lc: After the deal, it is 100% normal for all the players to wonder -- and inspect : "How would 4@H have done." ?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lc: N-S will be pleased with the answer.|pg||
mc|8|pg||
qx|o6|st||md|4SKQ72HT9DA84CAJ32,S93HK87432DK93C65,SJ85HAJ65DQJ52CK4,SAT64HQDT76CQT987|sv|e|nt|lc: Sure, it's a bad idea to think about the deal after it is over (you should go on to the next deal, mentally) -- but I doubt there is a player alive who could honestly not wonder ...|pg||
nt|lc: how 4@H would have faired.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|lc: Looks like a normal 3NT for everyone here.|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 5: It was important that over 1@S, North bid Lawfully at the 3 -level, not something meek like 2@C, in order to help push EW overboard. |pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lc: Love those LAW references :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|lc: We can't look at the recap sheets until after the session, but I will bet that each and every of 24 tables plays in 3NT here.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Last night, I predicted Bd 3 would be 420 at all 24 tables...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: I looked it up this morning.  It was 420 at 23 tables. |pg||
pc|cT|nt|lc: One table made 480 -- I suspect a revoke or misscoring :)|pg||
nt|dburn:  2NT? scant respect for the soundness of the paternal opening bid, that|pg||
nt|lc: Well, it was a white opening. Maybe they open some 11's -- so Son gave Dad some rope.|pg||
nt|lc: Of course, with a full (and good) 14, South has to go on.|pg||
nt|petergill: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_tricks in case there is anyone out there who doesn't know what we mean by the Law. |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|lc: So, with the cards relatively friendly, this is likely to be 430 (with a stray 400 or 460) at every table.|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|lc: Oh, I thought you were talking about lawyers and the legal system.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|lc: Note the proper techique in the @D suit -- this picks up 3 tricks whenever West has the @DK.|pg||
nt|lc: Much better than leading the @DQ from hand.|pg||
nt|petergill: or somewhere on http://larryco.com/|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: next round Duboin Ferraro coming|pg||
nt|lc: So, are we with the Bessis duo all day?|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: all this session|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|lc: I should have brushed up on my French.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|lc: As is obvious, this event has become quite international.  Used to be mostly Americans when it started in New York City some 30+years ago.|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|h3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|petergill: In the Bulletins at http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/, they say that they've done away with legal stuff like Appeals Committees at the Cavendish, instead having Directors ...|pg||
nt|petergill: review rulings that involve doubt, a simpler process. |pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lc: No matter what they do, somebody will complain.|pg||
nt|lc: They do have some of the best directors there--I respect their judgment.|pg||
nt|po-s: let me voice a complaint.... no, an opinion|pg||
nt|lc: I haven't been watching the play, but it seems declarer has to guess which finesse to take -- and can't go wrong.|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: this is the last table playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: so we will close and reopen right away with rd 22|pg||
nt|lc: Go ahead, P.O. ---|pg||
nt|petergill: In 1997, the late John Roberts (the bridge expert and promoter of Woodstock rock concert), Bob Blanchard and Billy Rosenbaum formed World Bridge Productions, and moved the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Cavendish from New York to Las Vegas, expanding it into a nearly million dollar event. |pg||
nt|po-s: just now the Swedish juniors play a tournament. Here is a way to show current results http://www.swangames.com/rama/eventinfo.php?eventid=283231|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: He might settle for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|lc: Has lost 4 already :)|pg||
nt|petergill: No 100% line for 10 tricks, I think|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|lc: He would surely settle for 9 now! :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, I wasn't with it|pg||
mc|9|nt|lc: None of us were -- it looked so east seeing all 4 hands :)|pg||
