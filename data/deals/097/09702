mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|henryb: we seem to be specializing in French teams in the early going|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: should be a fairly boring 4H here   will make 10 tricks|pg||
mb|5H!|an|2|mb|p|mb|5N|nt|dburn: the thing here may be to avoid seven, rather than to get to six|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|6D|nt|jlrice: they can try for the uppercut but with 3-3 trumps will not work|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|nt|dburn: but East has not shown heart length, so West will not place him with such as @hQJxx, opposite which seven would be cold|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Jacki: World Bridge Productions, in cooperation with BBO, is proud to present the 35th Annual Cavendish Invitational.|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|jlrice: at the other table pepsi did not want to raise partner with stiff K   |pg||

pc|sJ|pg||
nt|jlrice: yes  with T9x of diamonds Lall had no interest in going further after the 6@d bid|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|dburn: some Norths might venture an overcall, but they would struggle to get out for down one if they did|pg||

nt|jlrice: some Easts might bid over 1nt  i think they play 14-16 so hemant felt like he didnt quite have enough|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|henryb: Interesting question whether to overcall 1@h or 1@d. If you are on defense you want a @h lead. If you think you may want to play the hand you have more @d, so that is likely to be ...|pg||
nt|henryb: a better trump suit|pg||
nt|dburn: that may have cost declarer a tempo|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|jlrice: mahaffey overcalled 1@h instead of 1@d   gets partner to lead your better suit    but tough to get to 3@d|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d6|pc|c4|nt|jlrice: also your hearts are strong enough that if they have game a heart overcall could scare them out of 3NT thinking you might have 5 hearts off top|pg||

nt|atlantajon: or rusinow|pg||
nt|jlrice: i am a little aggressive with the bid but i like leaping michaels with N|pg||
nt|dburn: or at least, North carried him to 5@h - South then decided that since his spades might have been three small, his possession of @sA entitled him to bid a slam|pg||
nt|dburn: which would have made on a good day, if the 2@h opener had held the king of diamonds rather than hearts, say|pg||

mc|11|nt|dburn: facing a one-level opening bid rather than a weak two bid, and being forced to guess over 5@c, Lall's action was brave but reasonable - however....|pg||

mb|p|nt|dburn: ...on reflection Hamman might feel that he ought to have played the 5@c bidder for a void rather than the 2@c bidder|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jlrice: NS stole the contract here   5H can be made EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|jlrice: should be a big swing to zimmerman|pg||
nt|atlantajon: I would think so.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: even if they defend 4@s it is surely going to be X'd.|pg||
nt|jlrice: at the other table  auction went 3@s-4@s  and Lev didnt want to come in with W hand|pg||
nt|atlantajon: east thinking about slam??|pg||
nt|atlantajon: he has a good hand for @H contract.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: and his partner freely bid 4@h.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: the 3 small @s's is actually a good thing.|pg||
nt|jlrice: the problem with coming in is that you could be going for 800  if you partner has nothing   but you could be giving up a game swing if he has the right cards|pg||
nt|po-s: more fun if Weswt had played a spade after the hearts. Declarer would have taken his spades, then overtaken the clubs to produce one more undertrick|pg||
nt|jlrice: he might have figured he needed the void in order to overcall that horrible hand|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jlrice: over 4S|pg||
nt|po-s: dangerous...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: especially after jumper led Ace|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|po-s: or two|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: indeed, but if South really were void in diamonds, he would almost certainly have had a few spades, and might have entered the auction with a double and not an overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: In the other room it was strongly suggested that West should bid 5H over 2S-4S|pg||
nt|atlantajon: looks like the doubleton 10@c makes this hand....a place for the @h loser.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|atlantajon: 4@s does look like kickback.|pg||
mb|p|nt|atlantajon: 2 with the Q?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: i would take it that way   but 5@d would show 2 without then so not|pg||
nt|po-s: Well, what would East have done if West "freely" bids 5H?|pg||
nt|dburn: but that was a 25-IMP decision - 13 for Mahaffey instead of 12 for Hamman|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|henryb: losing a trick in each suit?|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|jlrice: but i would play 4@s as kickback and 4NT as spade Q|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|dburn: here Fu, who had no tenaces to protect, decided to led Zhao become declarer|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|atlantajon: That is why I had the ? on it.|pg||
nt|po-s: he will try to find South with Qxx of clubs|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s3|nt|henryb: I guess he can set up the fourth heart and fall back on the @c finesse if that dows not work|pg||
nt|po-s: why not|pg||
nt|atlantajon: I think he will look for 3-3 @H first.  then fall back on the @c hook.|pg||

nt|vugraphzps: Ok last board of this match, will be back in about 20 minutes with the 3th match of this session|pg||
nt|po-s: with only two it is clearly superior to go for hearts first|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: lasst board of this first session, hope to see all back at 1600 hrs vegas time, 1900 NYC time for  the second session|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|5D|mb|6D|nt|dburn: again the Chinese are putting pressure on by jumping to the five level|pg||
nt|jlrice: this is a lively board   seamon took out insurance by bidding 7D at other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: next match in some minutes, hope to see you all here|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but if they sell out to 6@s, that might give declarer the clue he needs to get the trumps right|pg||
mb|6S|nt|dburn: of course, Zhao might take out insurance himself|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: but if he passes slowly, there will be some pressure on Fu|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: partner would have tough decision on bumping to 6   if he is willing to try for slam on this auction surely he would bump to 6 on 3s P 4S 5H|pg||
nt|dburn: and if he doubles... well, maybe that is one of these non-penalty slam doubles, but there is some danger here|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: the X was alerted|pg||
nt|dburn: still, Hamman's pass to 6@d more or less confirms his void, so that Fu is likely to save anyway|pg||
nt|jlrice: i think bidding 7 should be done    you arent going to do worse than game their way|pg||
mb|7D|mb|d|nt|jlrice: good lead by mahaffey   need  to get club ruff off top to set|pg||
nt|atlantajon: all roads lead to 12 tricks....13 if they miss leading the @c.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|po-s: which card should East play?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well done by Fu - now Lall has to avoid bidding seven himself|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|dburn: unless of course he bids seven hearts, which he could make, but that is not really on the menu|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s7|nt|jlrice: depends on opponents carding i would say|pg||
nt|po-s: ok, standard|pg||
nt|jlrice: if they play udca i would play high   standard  low|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|atlantajon: Thanks Henry and Po.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: see you later .|pg||

nt|atlantajon: hope to see everyone then.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|po-s: seems hard to deal with the five|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d7|nt|jlrice: if they play standard you play low   his partner will know he has odd|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jlrice: yes   why play a different fit when you already have a known 11 card fit|pg||
pc|c5|nt|atlantajon: looks like declarer is playing for doubleton J@d|pg||
nt|jlrice: if you play high  he still might have doubleton which would encourage playing the king|pg||
nt|atlantajon: to park a @h|pg||
pc|c3|nt|po-s: with JT5 North must play the 5 in all methods|pg||
nt|atlantajon: since he created an entry in @c by unblocking the 10|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s2|pc|d8|pc|s5|pg||
nt|jlrice: well   hmm   sorry i was answering questions thinking wrong hand was on table  lol|pg||
nt|jlrice: might not change my answers though|pg||
nt|atlantajon: why wouldn't any south lead a big @c?|pg||
nt|atlantajon: it seems like the normal lead to me.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: I did.|pg||
nt|jlrice: if passell and multon club suits are switched could be devestating lead|pg||
nt|jlrice: for defense that is|pg||
nt|atlantajon: so...this is the second of 6 rounds for today?|pg||
nt|jlrice: yes|pg||
nt|jlrice: i am assuming after 3 they will put results of afternoon set on the website|pg||
nt|atlantajon: so...we have 1 more round...then they will break?|pg||
nt|atlantajon: I assume the same.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: for the KIBS:    http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/|pg||
nt|jlrice: you are quicker than I  was ab out to post website|pg||
nt|atlantajon: :)|pg||
nt|atlantajon: no swings in that round.....LOL    4 boards with 9+ imps ...that is a lot for a 9 board match.|pg||
nt|jlrice: and the results they have there right now are last years results if you try to check them|pg||
