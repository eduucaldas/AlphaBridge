nt|vugraphzpr: east son|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: sorry east dad|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: West son|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Your choice of bid as West?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I like 1@S |pg||
mb|3D|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpr: me too|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Father might have words to son after this auction ... West will bid 4@D, and East will, umm, blanch|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: 4D is possibly a transfer?|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpr: probably not|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: West will probably pack it in now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: ... and leave the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: the winner was passing 3nt|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is accident-prone territory|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: which I think is the right call|pg||
nt|bobh1: many pairs are shaky about what 4@d might mean|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: certainly enuff HCPs and a source of tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, 4NT may scrape home|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: Shane looks very unhappy|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is not the kind of hand you find in textbooks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If he does pass, the focus will be on South's lead|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Yes, Bob, I think it's very harsh to criticize West for bidding over 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: Bobby Shrugging with no idea whats going on|pg||
mb|6C|nt|bjacobs: Bewilderness Adventure|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|an|general principles|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Weinstein telling them what they already knew - they were too high|pg||
nt|bobh1: general principles and oh yeah KQxxx in your trump suit|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bjacobs: But I do feel that West should have passed 4NT, which is clearly to play|pg||

pc|d2|pc|c4|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bjacobs: Yes, good time to do it: 3rd seat, white versus red|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|c6|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bjacobs: I don't think many red-blooded players would pass that hand|pg||

nt|Jacki:  Tomorrow's session - final 9 rounds will start at 09:30 PDT 12:30 EDT 17:30 UK 18:30  Europe and a miserable 02:30 (says David Stern) Australian Eastern time |pg||
nt|bobh1: is 2@d something else?|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I think I need a diagram|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bjacobs: So Bobby is Shane's step-father ... or something|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: currectamundo|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: blanchards are doing well in the evennt|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So Shane figures ... "make sure step-dad wins - there could be a new car in this for me"  (just joking of course)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: started the session plus 900|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|bobh1: dropped a bit on the last board|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
nt|bobh1: shane and bob blanchard are both very competitive and would much rather beat these two up than get a new car|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: if anythingg stepdad is the one with imps to sparee|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As I recall, Bob and Jill Blanchard attempted to make legal history by entering the ACBL Mens Pairs event|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: that is correct|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and then sued the ACBL when it rejected their entry|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The upshot of this is that there are now no Men's Events in ACBL-land|pg||
nt|bobh1: ironically jill now plays a lot in the women's events|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: and caused the change that there will no longer be mens events|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bobh1: as opposed to the open events that run parallel|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: With North's aces covering West's queens, it's not going to be easy to make|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bjacobs: Bringing in the diamonds ... well you can overtake @DQ and get lucky I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: might need to play for dbltn 10 of@d|pg||
nt|bobh1: on this lead tho . . . |pg||
nt|bobh1: a @s would be better|pg||
nt|bobh1: altho impossible to find|pg||
nt|bobh1: N has a dilemma|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bjacobs: what dilemma is that?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bobh1: if he ducks they keep the @s entry and if he wins to attack the @s entry they have a @c entry|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|bjacobs: 10 doubleton diamond, or @HA on-side?  That is the question|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And I think he has followed the odds|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: Levin says 10xx|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|s3|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bjacobs: Now in theory, North can get endplayed: @HK, @SKQ, @C|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And you know, he might just find it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It actually involves letting North WIN the @C10|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bjacobs: But he stayed with plan A - @HA with South|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: Levin says the play will get faster|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bobh1: well he could have made this in more ways than one but very few will pull it off|pg||
mc|7|nt|vugraphzpr: back in 5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Interesting thrust and parry, and I think Bob Blanchard played it fine ... if unsuccessfully|pg||
