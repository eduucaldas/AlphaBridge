nt|reisig: In the other VG room ...Tudor Passed the X (of 3@D)|pg||
nt|reisig: and will fair FAR better ..with the automatic trump lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: 4 spades might be OK as they might just lose 3 spade tricks|pg||

nt|vugraphzpr: not sure why hamppson opened 1D  but at this point he is well ahead of the field|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|jlrice: maybe he just doesnt want a heart lead and figured they would be defending|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: Declarer might misguess the play now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: though seems like all roads lead to 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: Hampson is in 3rd seat but Rodwell didnt bid |pg||
nt|jlrice: still given where all the cards are  should still easily make   |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|reisig: @c 3-3 ..w ace right.....looks OK :)|pg||
nt|henryb: not best|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: not a good start for Casen|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: He asked to be Drewsky for the screen|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: I forgot|pg||
nt|henryb: that is his BBO name|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: Hampson asking questions of Krekorian and Drewsky intercedes|pg||
nt|reisig: I've been calling that for many years|pg||
nt|jlrice: he was trying to steal a dummy entry to lead clubs up to his hand   as he probably expects the heart king offside|pg||
nt|reisig: calling him|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|henryb: the 765 of @d are an interesting stopper|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: Hampson was hoping for Kx in declarers hand. But is that possible?|pg||
nt|henryb: no|pg||
nt|reisig: not|pg||
nt|jlrice: after the double it wouldnt be too likely|pg||
nt|jlrice: could have put pressure on by switching to a diamond|pg||

mb|4D|nt|reisig: looks OK|pg||
nt|henryb: and indeed it is|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlrice: would need to finesse club in order to make 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: might need the @c finesse though|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|henryb: I would make it after the 3@d opening|pg||
nt|reisig: OK ...stopped in 4@s ...go back to sleep everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: after @d and a @h shift|pg||
nt|po-s: why would we ask Gib - or DF?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: LOL|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jlrice: because we are too lazy to figure it out when all we have to do is press a button|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: its the 21st century!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: soon we will have a button that pushes the button for us|pg||
nt|henryb: I like to look at declarer's actual problem, not the double dummy solution|pg||
