nt|mariner1: 4@S plays well EW here|pg||

nt|vugraphznh: till now the ranking is: AIDA 64, kannavos 59, ONYX (romania) 58, POLINA 58, papakyriakopoulos 57, zipovski 54 |pg||
nt|hedyg: thanks!|pg||
nt|vugraphznh: we have to wait for the results, we will be back in 5 min|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Wroclaw for the Polish Premier League 2009. Semi-finals, six segments of 12 boards. This is the second|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  lebensohl 2NT from South ?|pg||
nt|xenya: from now onwards, we will have comparisons|pg||
nt|ady: Jagger in   with system bid for majors     - can make 2@H if they stop there|pg||
nt|thegarve:  West will bid up to at least 3@h|pg||
nt|athene: hi good morning everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome to Wroclaw for the Polish Premier League 2009. Semi-finals, six segments of 12 boards. This is the first|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mdgraham: running a bit behind schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H or 3N here|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: hello all|pg||
nt|athene: hi again everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: with good card reading, West can make 3@H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Mateusz|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|xenya: doesn't a @D lead beat 3@H?|pg||
nt|ady: anything above 2 level difficult for n/s|pg||
nt|finch: yes|pg||
nt|athene: north could have considered 2@C over 1@H there, perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: non-vul and a pretty fair suit|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mariner1: careful makes the 3N on any lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  IN the orther room - NOrth somehow stole 1NT+1|pg||
nt|finch: 3@C was forcing, I imagine, otherwise 3NT was a tad optimistic|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1nt as a passed hand would be minors, but that doesn't look sensible with such suit disparity|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: goodcase for passing, holding the @HQ, but I think West will bid 4@H |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: yes, he has :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|granguru: around the limit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a bit of pressure on declarer, as he will have a god idea the @SK is wrong - so he won't want to lose two trump tricks |pg||
pc|h7|pg||

nt|granguru: good stop|pg||
nt|mariner1: W probably makes a good decision not to compete further|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  Reasonable 6@c?|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  Two @d ruffs|pg||
pc|dA|nt|granguru: Hi Rob|pg||
nt|athene: i assume E-W play some variation of Polish Club, so West can't have a 'normal' 2NT rebid (18-19 balanced)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: @DA and another will work well |pg||
pc|d3|nt|mariner1: hi John|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: but i must say, it looks possible that East was treating 2NT as natural|pg||

nt|hedyg: hello :)|pg||
nt|ady: hi Hedy|pg||
nt|ady: only 2nd hand    first was a throw in|pg||
nt|hedyg: after 4 matches: AIDA 64, Kannavos 59, ONYX (Romania) 58, POLINA 58, Papakyriakopoulos 57, Zipovski 54 |pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: missed the announcement . sry|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    n/s with their combined 17 pts  can make  4@C   but will they find the club contract after a no-trump opening from west|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@h limit in EW, 4@c NS|pg||
nt|athene: presumably the 7 imps is some sort of carry-over|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: not sure I believe Open made 6 there :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: someone could get shoved too high here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|an|11-14|nt|thegarve:  danger of going overboard in @d|pg||
nt|mariner1: only part scores it seems here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, 7.2 actually|pg||
nt|athene: now north wants to show a good 3-card raise|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But our software does not do fractions|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C would be the normal way if you treat 1@C as natural|pg||
nt|athene: a very weak NT!|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk4: EW can make 3NT on this layout, but they are unlikely to get there|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   very duplicated   can only make 2@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs a tool to show a 3 suiter|pg||
mb|2D!|an|!D|nt|athene: E-W have 6@C but pretty much impossible to find at the best of times|pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: can double 2@H for t/o now|pg||
nt|ady: north may well re-open with double|pg||
nt|hedyg: even 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: may have to re-open at 3 level|pg||
nt|hedyg: W should pass with QJx in @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: on the other hand the long @hs..|pg||
nt|ady: but nothin much lost if letting e/w play 3@H  should be down 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: hard to stay out of game here, although 3NT looks for most natural final contract|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   not a bad spot for e/w    -  but the diamond unkind   and a likely spade lead will beat it|pg||
nt|thegarve:  I expect 2@d was an Artificial GF|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N very aggressive call from E with his 11|pg||
nt|mariner1: seems he is looking for the 8th and 9th trick|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt makes for N-S - if they see through the backs of the cards|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|finch: Unusually for a ladies' pair, EW play 5card majors, strong NT|pg||
nt|thegarve:  now with doubt about @h stops - I expect to see 5@d|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And it's very unlucky anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You need @S6 as an entry to take the club finesse|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H is down on the spade ruff|pg||
nt|athene: sorry NS have 6@C :)|pg||
nt|athene: now south will just bid 4@S i imagine|pg||
nt|athene: when you have 5-3 fits in both black suits, clubs rarely get a look-in :)|pg||
nt|athene: south has a good hand facing short diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: all his hcp are working|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Panja|pg||
nt|panja: hi Roland, all|pg||
nt|athene: a spectator just points out that 6@C goes down on diamond lead|pg||
nt|athene: because of course you get forced|pg||
nt|athene: so the 4-1 club break dooms both black slams, for different reasons :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dburn: may not get a spade lead on this bidding, mind|pg||
nt|mariner1: I see 8th, 9th will be harder|pg||
nt|Walddk4: *lucky I meant to say|pg||
nt|hedyg: hello again!|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: personally sitting West I'd have more doubts about club stops|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D interesting...i wonder if he is trying to keep 3nt in the picture?|pg||
nt|panja: North would have passed the 2@D double..with a BAL|pg||
nt|athene: i can't believe he is considering staying out of game?|pg||
nt|panja: what does the first dbl show? the second?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|hedyg: pls disregard the score, it has NOTHING to do with this match|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but South will probably not have much choice - hearts are going to be the unbid suit, but the singleton @hQ isn't really a candidate|pg||
nt|finch: 3NT is certainly a better spot that 5@D|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE  LIMERICK ****  N-IRELAND 92, SCOTLAND 91, ENGLAND 79,  CBAI 71, IRELAND 68,  WALES 45  ****|pg||
nt|dburn: though I guess clubs might not be a "bid suit" in this auction - not sure how many of them East has promised|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|dburn: well, West has started bidding them|pg||
nt|finch: East has promised 3@C, although having denied diamond support probably should have 4 now|pg||
nt|finch: looks as if 4@C is a self-cue for diamonds.  Either that, or Gerber.|pg||
nt|dburn: exclusion keycard Gerber for diamonds, one assumes|pg||
nt|thegarve:  3NT off in the other room , I doubt if 5@d will be doubled|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: N/S respect the LAW and do not compete to 3 @H|pg||
nt|athene: if north had shown a good raise, i think south might have gone 3@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: five aces|pg||
nt|finch: 3NT went off after a spade lead, spade return, diamond to the jack ducked|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and a void|pg||
nt|athene: first double is good hand, second is penalties i am assuming|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mariner1: sure seems E owes W a @S raise here.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West might have tried one more spade there |pg||
nt|athene: 3@H would be very interesting on spade lead, @SAK, ruff, club back to the @CA, fourth spade|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: south did not cover the @D since he wants @C play from p|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dburn: exclusing @cA, of course|pg||
nt|finch: EW are probably fortunate that everything else is going off |pg||
nt|mariner1: I think over 2@H was needed as well|pg||
nt|athene: if the defence don't do that, the trump position will be revealed and declarer can pick up the @HQ10|pg||
nt|athene: same contract, same lead in other room|pg||
nt|athene: west put the @C10 in|pg||
nt|panja: with such an UNBAL hand, the dbl by N seems a bit odd|pg||
nt|athene: well he is a bit stuck - has to double to show a good hand|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S risks missing game |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: the everything else can only be 3NT   and that might make with a defensive slip up|pg||
pc|c8|nt|xenya: i'm not sure EW have been on the same wavelength here|pg||
pc|s4|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|finch: South probably feels the need for slightly better diamonds to double.  It sounds as if the opponents are making slam tries|pg||
nt|dburn: they were doing OK until East raised what she thought were West's clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, East might have done, with three trumps|pg||
mc|11|nt|thegarve:  the 5@c indicates that, but it is not an easy hand to bid|pg||
pg||

nt|finch: or it could be invitational with the minors (that's how I play it)|pg||
nt|athene: north can't really have @DAK as well as everything else|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: he counted north's points and knew he cud not have the 2nd @D honour|pg||
nt|panja: the dbl carries the risk that South might pass with a BAL hand..and some up to 8 HCP..|pg||
nt|athene: it was easier to read the lead as a singleton perhaps in this room|pg||
nt|panja: 1Nt might be cold..and so might some black suit partial for NS|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mariner1: yes agression is paying off for NS mainly because EW are not that aggressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: looks like 4@H  for n/s|pg||
nt|thegarve:  penalty shootout in the FA Cup semi final Man U v Everton, no goals at extra time|pg||
nt|finch: that's what I would call an 'aggressive' 2@D overcall at red|pg||
nt|mariner1: so did not find the 8th then|pg||
nt|mariner1: aggression|pg||
nt|athene: east will probably double 1@H|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mariner1: NS have 6@H if they can find it|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice 3N here|pg||
nt|mariner1: not the easiest bidding|pg||
nt|hedyg: just stay out of grand..|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: EW obviously on the same wavelength, as surely East is close to raising a sound overcall|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops I missed a car, they have 5@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS playing inverted majors to 1@D? |pg||
nt|mariner1: can EW even find it now|pg||
nt|athene: ok - or not :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mariner1: card|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S good spot here|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not completely clear that North-South will get these to game|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c hook off stops 6|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe 1@S shows a 1N call|pg||
nt|athene: east will surely double this?|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|Walddk4: 1@S shows hearts in their methods|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that is, 1@D-1@h=spades and 1@d-1@S=hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: some use 1N as 4+ @S and 1@S and a 1N call to put the 1N in opener|pg||
nt|mariner1: no alert so its hard to tell which it is Mike :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: so Roland knows it seems|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what's the advantage of that, Roland?|pg||
nt|mariner1: E may be pickled here|pg||
nt|hedyg: but N has no reason to go for the grand anyhow|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: good prediction|pg||
nt|dburn: since South doesn't have to have a sixt heart for 2@h in this auction|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW did not need much for slam......|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d splinter|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  could bid to 7@H      but  4-1 break  bad     6@H may get swing|pg||
nt|athene: E-W won't do too badly in 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: ah - north isn't going to pass 1nt|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|finch: doesn't North have an invite, if they play sound opening bids?|pg||
nt|ady: stopped short      surely worth 3@H|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Kevin Cautious looking at Axxx @d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he has to bid 2@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: again aggression goes to the front for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well NS can beat 4@S however it is not their top spot|pg||
nt|mariner1: a defense slip can allow 4@S also|pg||
nt|granguru: very unprobable|pg||
nt|hedyg: S has a QUICK 4@h bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: still N has a good hand -- the pass is questionable i think|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C puppet to 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, they may or may not play sound opening bids, and North might have risked a move anyway, but as I say, it wasn't obvious|pg||
nt|finch: Carol Cautious, surely?|pg||
nt|athene: the defence will only come to @HAK, 3 spades and maybe @DK|pg||
nt|athene: with a balanced hand and just 4 diamonds, south wld open 1@C, usually|pg||
nt|athene: so he has presumably promised 5 here|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: i would double 2@D with east's hand, i have to say|pg||
nt|athene: 5/4 in the unbid suits and some hcp|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|ady: North worried about wastage in diamonds opposite shortage    but north obviously bidding on|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|finch: If clubs were 5-1 we'd be saying 'well stopped'|pg||
nt|thegarve:  doubt it|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  SCOTLAND 92, N-IRELAND 90, ENGLAND 79, CBAI 70, IRELAND 70, WALES 45 ****|pg||
nt|mdgraham: some English pairs use this major suit inversion over 1@D, but I can't see any major theoretical merit (or else I'm too stupid)|pg||
nt|athene: sorry @DA|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now enter in @C and @D fin|pg||
nt|athene: no, sorry - they have time to get the @DQ as well|pg||
nt|panja: isn't @D an automatice lead here?|pg||
nt|athene: diamond certainly looks reasonable lead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: maybe that 2@d overcall was a good idea after all, although I confess it doesn't look like one|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe 4@s is kickback and 6@c shows 3 keycards..|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: ducking the first heart did give declarer a chance to make by switching to clubs|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hedyg: because normal action for N to ask keycards after 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: but he would have had to guess those right, which is unlikely|pg||
nt|athene: the play gets quite intricate now|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Oliver Clarke|pg||
nt|oliverc: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|panja: 5 IMPs given away on a speculative lead|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mariner1: 1@S here alerted because EW play some system that limits the point count  I|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mariner1: THINK :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: now it's cold again|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: the defence needed to use west's spade as an entry to his @DQ|pg||
nt|athene: this quite often happens in defence to 1nt|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: have stopped in 6   North perhaps being cautious after the sing off after the splinter|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: if you have a 4-4 fit that you have set up|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: you need to not cash it|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: sign|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: needs help in @C and asked for it with 6@c i guess|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: fuff 2 clubs  |pg||
nt|athene: because you need to use it as transportation|pg||
nt|athene: ping-pong here :) declarer doesn't read the diamonds|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: another 7 to england|pg||
nt|panja: perhaps, West was thinking of a @H honour lead vs. 1Nt....and skipped backtracking although bidding continue further..?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: ruff|pg||
nt|hedyg: fuff indeed :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: disc @s?|pg||
nt|ady: does not really matter will just make 1 trump tgrick|pg||
nt|hedyg: slowly disc a @s?|pg||
nt|hedyg: very slowly?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: East was a bit too passive there.  |pg||
nt|mariner1: one problem with those type calls is they become considerably less effective as|pg||
nt|mariner1: the level of opponents increases......... they need to be fit well into the overall|pg||
nt|mariner1: structure of a system|pg||
nt|hedyg: might be difficult to avoid 4@h|pg||
nt|athene: well, even though E-W beat 1nt, they would have scored better in 2@S, i think|pg||
nt|panja: a slam on board 16....a GS even|pg||
mb|1S|nt|finch: 10 tricks NS is a surprisingly large number|pg||
nt|dburn: not often Brown and Stockdale stop in 2NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS should force more in @D here than in Open Room|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I see 11,,, would have to come up with 12th....... lead could help if played in E|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6N is what I see them in|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mariner1: EW are finding out if you sit on your hands you will lose a lot of tournaments and|pg||
nt|mariner1: have flat hands............|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S partial EW.... game off best defense|pg||
nt|ady: a partial in hearts seems the best on this hand    only 3 top losers   but with the 4-1 trump break  game seems to much|pg||
nt|athene: it should be possible to have a fairly smooth auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the Polish 1@C opener is very vulnerable to pre-emption, i think|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dburn: is it? without a spade lead at trick one, there seem to be ten winners|pg||
nt|ady: well they have got a 22pt semi mis fit|pg||
nt|finch: yes, but only if you take the first diamond|pg||
nt|athene: and it's something which is really not exploited as much as it could be|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S 2@D 2@H 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: assuming that's forcing of course :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: 6 in reach, not sure there's much chance of them getting to 7|pg||
nt|panja: the only problem is West's stiff @D opposite the 2@D bid|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dburn: 1@h? is that some cunning plan?|pg||
nt|finch: it would a more amusing cunning plan NV|pg||
nt|mariner1: S has no reall attractive call here,,,,,,, I do not particularly like 1N with KQ stiff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, all calls seem to have one or more major flaws|pg||
nt|mariner1: Mike do you like the 1N? (2@C regrettable @c might be my call)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: so EW must play some sort of forcing @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: now we find out whether 2@d was gf|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|athene: yes, it will be hard for E-W to diagnose that the @DK isn't a worry|pg||
nt|panja: with this layout, W can simply ask aces and get to the grand..|pg||
nt|panja: what does W need? three key cards, and the trump Q..|pg||
nt|athene: actually having said all that, the grand isn't absolutely laydown - but it's pretty good|pg||
mb|4C|nt|thegarve:  Everton win penalty shootout|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not with KQ stiff, and 2@C should really be a better suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N makes NS, hard to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: 3@h certainly seems to suggest some artifice - a passed hand facing a vulnerable overcall ought to bid more than that|pg||
nt|finch: 3@H appears to be limit raise values (or more), so perahps South should have seen it through with 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: it wasnt|pg||
nt|ady: not|pg||
nt|ady: trump leads look best|pg||
nt|oliverc: If 2@D is GF then 3@H is very definitely slam-invitational here, so we should get some|pg||
nt|oliverc: cue-bidding|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mariner1: and has to play @D the only way that works|pg||
nt|panja: and...4-card trump support..which is not very clear yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: now a rolling 4@H perhaps|pg||
mb|4N|nt|dburn: still, I guess 3@h has good chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: this may well take more tricks than it technically should, because the defence will not have the right idea|pg||
nt|dburn: again, declarer has pretty much the same ten top tricks as in 2NT without a spade attack|pg||
nt|finch: in fact I think it makes a load of tricks anyway with no entry to the diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: she can make 10 with all cards in view, not sure about single dummy|pg||
nt|finch: best is to take two hearts before touching clubs, but in practice she might win the heart and play a second club at once|pg||
nt|thegarve:  she will probably assume a@s is with West|pg||
nt|ady: dont think 3NT appeals -  singleton diamond  and opposite a passed hand   10C makes the hand good in no-trumps|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe I need coffee........ just reminded 4@S 3@H 2@D and 3@C are 12 :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: so what do you bid with S over the 1@S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: small @H in case pd has a stiff high honour|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: not an easy hand to play |pg||
nt|athene: west has the perfect hand, so 6@C makes|pg||
nt|athene: 5@S now asking for @HQ and other assorted goodies|pg||
mb|5S|nt|panja: if W bids 5@S now..E should simply bid 7...should he not?|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: @C-@H squeeze for 7NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: so the slam is easier than I 1st "envisioned"|pg||
nt|granguru: After 4@S and @DAK S cant hold both rounded suits|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes|pg||
mb|6C|nt|mdgraham: perhaps this is the unbiddable hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: borrow a @H from last deck..|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: If West's double denied four spades (as it appears from the auction), she'll get a count of the hand in due course|pg||
mb|7H|nt|finch: 3NT may not immediately appeal, but you have to compare it with the thought of playing 3@H|pg||
nt|xenya: now a club should hold it|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: But E can also go for the @CJ  finesse which is bad this time|pg||
nt|granguru: 6NT from top|pg||
nt|athene: east could see pretty much how the play would go - the @DAKQ can be used for fast discards|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@C is regrettable to me...... just no other good calls|pg||
nt|mdgraham: doubling 3@S seems a bit chancy|pg||
nt|mariner1: I find pass even more regrettable :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one-and-a-half clubs, perhaps|pg||
nt|oliverc: wow, Nicely done|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: when north wins A@C   ace and another trump|pg||
nt|athene: 6@C sounds like @HQ and @CK to me, but i am sure they know what they are doing|pg||
nt|panja: the wrong player bids the GS, I guess...does W know enough to suspect that the GS is good?|pg||
nt|athene: well he knows everything he is facing|pg||
nt|oliverc: yup|pg||
nt|athene: except the @DQ|pg||
nt|panja: I mean 4th trump...|pg||
nt|panja: does W know that?|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H has to be 4|pg||
nt|panja: well..with 2353..and without Club check....what can E rebid?|pg||
nt|athene: something else :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: if trumps were 3-1 this would take a bit more playing|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: because you can't ruff the spades good AND ruff a club in dummy|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sunsamvar: that was quick|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ady: ruff a spade and  discard last spade on K@D|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: although maybe 1NT is just practical bridge - I have x-y points and a spade stop |pg||
pc|d9|nt|mariner1: operator says 1@D has different meanings based on position|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mariner1: and since S can see 4@C in dummy he will pitch a @H allowing 7 if declarer sees|pg||
nt|mariner1: it that way|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers asking if I consider 2N unusual with S, yes I do NV, the problem here is|pg||
nt|mariner1: RED you have no way to assess N's strenght and will pay a high prices if wrong|pg||
nt|athene: you might try to set up the diamonds|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|xenya: cash 2 clubs pitching @Ss|pg||
nt|thegarve:  amusing part-score hand|pg||
nt|xenya: @Ds, sorry|pg||
nt|thegarve:  east is now in on the secret|pg||
nt|ady: oh gone differeently|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hedyg: down in 3?|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm|pg||
nt|ady: $@H OR    also down 1|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes but 4@H|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h4|nt|mariner1: I am very disciplined in my 1N overcalls,,,,,, I like to have what LOOKS LIKE 2|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|athene: that looks best - ruff the diamonds good and reverse dummy|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mariner1: am told last weak NS and EW joined to play Cayne Team here on BBO and|pg||
nt|mariner1: won,,,,,,,,,,|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|hA|nt|thegarve:  hmm off now|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|finch: eh? what was wrong with playing another club|pg||
nt|athene: but dummy doesn't have all that many entries|pg||
nt|panja: well..it might have been better to try Spades first..and finesse @DQ if major suit don't break satisfactorily|pg||
nt|athene: if someone had @H10x left now you couldn't ruff another diamond safely|pg||
nt|athene: i think perhaps try just boringly drawing trumps was the best %|pg||
nt|athene: if they are 2-2 you are pretty much home|pg||
nt|athene: if they are 3-1, you hope for spades 3-3 or the @DK onside|pg||
nt|oliverc: He pretty much has to play for 2-2 trumps from here|pg||
nt|oliverc: little chance of a black-suit squeeze|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|mariner1: has several ways to lock this in now|pg||

nt|mariner1: stoppers|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, South has gained 5 imps, but rather lucky really|pg||
nt|mariner1: the Chinese overcall 1N and open 1N and 2N with a stiff|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice stop on that hand |pg||
nt|athene: even so, i think it was aggressive - east needed west to have every single card he had|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 16 opposite a pretty good 8 though cards are not sitting well for them......|pg||
nt|arel1: 1@d 11-15 bal|pg||
nt|hedyg: score is 3:3|pg||
mb|1N|an|11-14|nt|ady: n/s  look destined to play either 1NT   or 2@S    both likely to go down|pg||
mb|2N!|an|any two suits, without both major|nt|mariner1: now over the 2@S by E in Open Room I would have to bid 2N with S,,,,,,, DBL|pg||
nt|mariner1: and PASS are not options|pg||
nt|oliverc: Not, one suspects, what North was dying to hear|pg||
mb|d|nt|finch: 2@D multi, showing a bad weak two in a major or various strong hands|pg||
nt|ady: good save by wales in OR  5@H|pg||
nt|thegarve:  should get to 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: lets try again  |pg||
nt|athene: well it cld be worse -  he has a pretty good hand in support of minors|pg||
nt|athene: three useful honours|pg||
nt|athene: the only problem is, as 1NT is weak, he may imagine that 2NT has to be constructive|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  West is unlikely to save looking at least 3 defensive tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: not completely clear to save over it - that West hand has some defensive prospects|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has play here|pg||
nt|athene: interesting - i wonder if south's lack of double was judgement or system|pg||
nt|oliverc: West going to be disappointed, though, if he ends up doubling 3@D|pg||
nt|athene: but the double has probably alerted him to what is going on|pg||
mb|r|nt|mariner1: looks cold in fact with the pointed Aces set right|pg||
nt|sybarra: will need the @H guess |pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Rob |pg||
nt|sybarra: a likely 3 nt for n/s here |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: think South will have to get to 4@S herself|pg||
nt|dburn: so the Welsh West, Jean Hand, took a pretty good decision|pg||
nt|thegarve:  if she passes 2@s it would only be 50s - an old ploy|pg||
nt|finch: at the other table West guessed well, although I don't think that weak two was a 'bad' one|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S off, @H off, at lead @c are 3 3,,,,,, @D could be worse|pg||
nt|mariner1: has no real choice I think and the 3@D call helps define the play|pg||
nt|hedyg: unfriendly hand|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. i wonder if double would have been artificial|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: west  could lead a top spade  and then decide|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c in EW|pg||
nt|hedyg: but no way to bid it|pg||
nt|ady: yes    e/w could make 2@C   but could not really get into the bidding|pg||
nt|ady: you got there ffirst Heddy|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs a miracle in @D and there is no such thing|pg||
nt|ady: wont go down if they dont play a card|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: making at least 4 |pg||
nt|athene: if i passed 1nt i would surely double 2@S for t/o though|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: 5@H more of a 2-way shot, could collect x AQxxxx Qxxx xx and make on a good day|pg||
nt|dburn: no saves now - Seale adopting more of a Manchester United approach than an Everton approach to saving|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N in N I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: undo please operator :)|pg||
nt|athene: if pass was neutral, surely south should have bid 3@D himself with 6-5?|pg||
nt|athene: length more important than the extra honour|pg||
nt|oliverc: I would have thought so|pg||
nt|athene: ah ok 2nt wasn't specifically minors|pg||
nt|oliverc: interesting treatment|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mariner1: 4@H tough spot|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder what strength they play it as?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: whatever Bill... it is not often that you dont bid at all with 19 points|pg||
nt|athene: but south does have a very defensive hand|pg||
nt|athene: so prefers to just try for some 50s rather than risking going down at the 3-level|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: can cash for 10 tricks |pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|vugraphznh: sry the connection is very bad|pg||
nt|hedyg: still waiting for the @D spots to change|pg||
nt|ady: could make if spade position favourable    but not that difficult hand to play   |pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like connection problems, he really does not have that many choices|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: operator?|pg||
nt|athene: if you are going to bid it on very weak hands like south, you can't really use it for strong ones too|pg||
nt|panja: against, perhaps a trump lead might have been better?|pg||
nt|athene: not without a lot of guessing|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mariner1: well the @D now look better for NS,,,,|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|finch: passing out 2@S is much more tempting if South has shown 16+, but I doubt it would work here: 4@S is still natural over it|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S return is good for defense|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|oliverc: never going to stop the @D ruff, though so not sure it makes a diff|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: now making +2 |pg||

pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: no, declarer is never making even without @D ruff|pg||

pc|h5|nt|ady: 8 back for wales|pg||

pc|hK|pc|d9|pg||

pc|c9|nt|oliverc: Panja, I agree that a trump is a standout lead here. Just saying that I don't think it|pg||
nt|oliverc: actually makes a difference on this layout|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||

nt|ady: 3@S   competitive   so east right to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N has a play,,,|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to duck 1st @S if led|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and this may be a perfect example|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north can't bid 6nt as they might be off @HK and @CA|pg||
nt|oliverc: wow, that's a little unexpected. lots of ways for this to be defeated, even with the|pg||
nt|oliverc: KJX@H onside|pg||
nt|athene: with nothing in spades and a fifth heart, north should bid 4@H over 3@SX, maybe...but not easy at all|pg||
nt|panja: this should make...|pg||
nt|panja: he will need to ruff third Spade for the second entry|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: this could get tricky |pg||
nt|athene: trump lead helps declarer a lot|pg||
nt|oliverc: a trump lead is not one of them, though|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: and a heart lead wld be embarrassing :)|pg||
nt|athene: excellently done in the open room to flatten 6@C|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: will certainly make this now|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N was a better spot,, K@S lead helps a lot|pg||

nt|oliverc: yes|pg||

nt|panja: not done yet...|pg||
pc|h9|nt|finch: south learnt not to claim with any trumps outstanding|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|oliverc: easy to place KJ@H onside now|pg||

nt|sybarra: although can not make both clubs probably at same time |pg||

pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: East should possibly have cashed @SA earlier, but it shouldn't matter|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|oliverc: This is such an easy game :) (sigh. Why do Opps never makes leads like that|pg||
nt|oliverc: against me? If I bid to 4@H here, West would find the Q@C lead for sure LOL)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|panja: surely, NS didn't seem to have a @S check..|pg||

nt|athene: now we will all run across to see :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: One can't blame East for doubling 6@H on 19, but ...|pg||

nt|mariner1: penultimate board now|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes aggression backfired there|pg||
nt|mariner1: easy 4@S here|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board of this session........|pg||
nt|sybarra: as I am reminded "only 4 imps" |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes they were lucky there is this close a match|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 imps in a 6 - 7 match is huge....... lead vs being behind|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests there was the risk (from north's point of view) that opps had @CAK to cash|pg||
nt|athene: this is true but it's extremely unlikely|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board 13 was my kind of slam, around 10%|pg||
nt|oliverc: right|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6@S can be defeated, 6@H can't as you see|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: South missed an inference there - if North was strong, he could have bid 2@S for take-out a round earlier|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  maybe not if West cashes a@h v 4@S and underleads the @ds|pg||
nt|ady: 4@s  a make for e/w   |pg||
nt|athene: there's a principle names after someone-or-other, isn't there, saying that it's better to play in the weaker of your two fits|pg||
nt|athene: *named|pg||
nt|panja: 6@h should make even on a @C lead..|pg||
nt|athene: you want the solid suit to be side suit and the weak one to be trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I doubt that this will be flat|pg||
nt|panja: exchange one of West's @S with East's small @H..and 6@H won't make|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|athene: if you get paranoid about these things you miss a lot of slams and make life much harder for yourself|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: that would get you into the papers|pg||
nt|thegarve:  get 4@s two off|pg||
nt|mariner1: we started a little late so I am NOT sure when the next session from Greece|pg||
nt|mariner1: will start.|pg||
nt|mariner1: be sure to check the vugraph schedule for the many vugraphs Roland has|pg||
nt|mariner1: scheduled this weekend! -|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|athene: hard for it to be flat without being the same contract|pg||
nt|Walddk4: or make spades be 3-1|pg||
nt|athene: is there anything else that adds up to 1620?|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|sybarra: in 8 bd matches,  tough to lose a hand lke that and recover |pg||
nt|athene: i suppose e-w might go 3 down redoubled - but that's still 1 imp difference|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east will surely double if north cues clubs at any point|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@H: non-minimum, no shortage. I agree with non-minimum. This is a very good 13 count|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 14, sorry|pg||
nt|athene: it's a very good 14 count, even :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: n/s play a club system (perhaps orange club)  and 1 @D =07 |pg||
nt|mariner1: EW might make 4@H here,,,,,,,, 3N has an issue|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well-judged from west; 2@H might miss the game|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: running scores: http://tinyurl.com/oh5tmv|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|finch: more plausible is one top diamond first|pg||
nt|ady: it is a possibility|pg||
nt|thegarve:  switch to q@d to get an enc/disc signal|pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland has many excellent vugraphs on the schedule this weekend!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so there is an inference that North is just protecting with good shape  |pg||
nt|ady: 5@H   save to much if they find best defence|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt = spade cue?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sunsamvar: double major fit get E/W going to game|pg||
mb|d|nt|finch: if diamonds are 5332 with partner having the doubleton you look a bit silly underleading the first round|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: either that, or just shows general happiness without being able to cue 4minor|pg||
nt|oliverc: or maybe denying a Club cue|pg||
mb|r|nt|sybarra: am told its a sort of polish club with variations |pg||
nt|mariner1: ok a @D lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think its very close to the orange club via Jan Jansma |pg||
nt|athene: this is too costly|pg||
nt|athene: as long as the defence stay away from clubs declarer must lose two tricks in each side suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  hmm|pg||
nt|athene: 1100|pg||
nt|athene: the main thing is for south to NOT bid 4@D|pg||
mb|4D|nt|athene: but if they mix firsts and seconds....|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now that East got the chance to double clubs at a lowish level, he will not double 6@H|pg||
nt|athene: this is where that style doesn't work so well|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|mariner1: and off from the top now|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|finch: not sure what's percentage here. Partner could have singleton @SJ and declarer the @DJ|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: as spec pointed out bd 22 4H (vuln) was cold for EW 650,so loss may be 150|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: both N AND S have soft values and no distribution... so bad bid|pg||
nt|oliverc: still going to be 12 IMPs away even if South makes this|pg||
nt|athene: well i am not sure about what was going on in this auction, precisely - it seems to me that north couldn't bid 4NT blackwood with confidence|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: he could if he knew for sure that south DID (or DIDN'T) have the @DA|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: south obviously thought that the double of 3@D was inviting a sac|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||

nt|sybarra: and to the specs, who are always helpful.  I enjoy your comments |pg||
nt|athene: as usual, it's not good for all the strength to be massed in one hand|pg||
nt|athene: no way for west to get in and put the @DQ through|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the @S honours shd provide parking place for the @D|pg||
nt|athene: playing 2@D wld be more fun for E-W than defending 1NT|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: looks like 2@d  is the limit  n/s|pg||
nt|ady: I think 1NT better 2nd bit by east    |pg||
nt|athene: so the defence can't get their four tricks|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mariner1: yes and not the easiest play,,,, is possible|pg||
nt|mariner1: good to see a player that knows an invitation can be refused|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: declarer just leads up to @SKQ and pitches @D - right|pg||

nt|mariner1: easier now|pg||
pc|d9|nt|finch: I admit I'd have led my AK suit. Dummy is known to be short in diamonds|pg||
nt|thegarve:  why not a@H?|pg||

pc|h2|pc|c5|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: dont like A@D lead    why not A@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bad news in clubs, but good news in diamonds  |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|mariner1: yes now has a couple of ways to make it and both work|pg||
nt|granguru: to avoid losing @Cs..the @C return made things much more easy|pg||

nt|finch: that's a nice play in clubs. gains with Ax and also on this layout|pg||
nt|ady: spec has requested address to find previous results|pg||
pc|h4|nt|finch: although from South's perspective, if North's 5 was a true card it's either a singleton or J95|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
nt|mariner1: well this is one of those STOM hands..... and could decide mathc|pg||
nt|mariner1: STOM - state of match|pg||

nt|oliverc: no|pg||
nt|oliverc: me either|pg||
nt|oliverc: nothing to be gained|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he was hoping that east might duck it if he had the @CK|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|athene: whereas he wouldn't duck a club to the unsupported @CQ|pg||

mb|2H|nt|athene: a fine opening i think|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: AJ10x is worth a lot more than 5 hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: likely to be same contract as OR|pg||
nt|athene: another slam (grand slam in fact) dependent on the right void|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H from south now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: oh yes|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: risky without discussion - and 1@D might be some strong hands, perhaps, which would make it doubly risky|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: not a triumph for either N-S pair|pg||
nt|athene: 7@S is perhaps a bit much to ask but you should be in six, i think|pg||

nt|xenya: who is to blame here? S for trying to find a few specific cards with N for a slam to be good, or N for converting to 4@S?|pg||
nt|athene: no, with a marked 2-suiter (5-5 or more extreme), 3nt is very rarely going to be right|pg||
nt|athene: if partner is strong enough for both suits to run, you are going to make slam|pg||
nt|athene: and if he isn't, just running one suit isn't going to give you enough tricks for 3nt|pg||
nt|oliverc: absolutely, Bill|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|thegarve:  an exciting board |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: you would do well to bid to 6@D. You would also do well to make it; it's not obvious what the right line is|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S now from south perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: he can't have much more and not overcall 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he isn't sure what the double means - but it was t/o last time :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: I have never been a fan of Weak jump-shifts that aren't based on at least a decent|pg||
nt|oliverc: tolerance for partner's suit|pg||
nt|oliverc: trump leads will give West no chance here|pg||
pc|cT|nt|thegarve:  should make 6NT by playing q@s from hand without releasing a@S to attempt to create an entry to dummy |pg||
nt|dburn: maybe they can duck|pg||
nt|athene: well 3@D looks intermediate to me...but there's surely risk of losing hearts? perhaps it shows 4@H6@D or something weird|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dburn: but I agree, it's not at all clear|pg||
pc|c7|nt|thegarve:  you can play a 3@S reponse to 2@C as 4@S and 5@D|pg||
nt|finch: obviously you can make double dummy after the @SQ holds by enplaying North. |pg||
nt|thegarve:  or 2@c 2@d 3@s as 4!@S and 5@d from declarer too|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|h5|nt|finch: maybe you should do... win the lead, queen of spades winning, ace of spades, oops, what else is there to play for?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk4: We are in Wroclaw (German: Breslau), the chief city of the historical region of Lower Silesia in south-western Poland, situated on the Oder river|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|finch: 6@S however is not going to make|pg||
nt|ady: can then cash all clubs  and try diamonds    and end play North|pg||
nt|ady: was afraid they might find that|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: well looking at EW's hands, 6@S doesn't look all that bad|pg||
nt|thegarve:  a little sad that you do not possess 9@s|pg||
nt|finch: yes, single dummy 6@S looks a pretty good spot. You would have been worried about a heart lead in 6NT|pg||
nt|thegarve:  no-one has 9 0r 10 asks even in relay systems|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|athene: declarer is likely to get the clubs wrong|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see how he will be able to get a count on east's hand|pg||
nt|athene: the only thing that might force him to play right is lack of dummy entries to take the double finesse against the @CK10|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||

nt|thegarve:  did well to make 4@s in the other room with mirror distributions|pg||
nt|athene: of course once east showed up with @DAK, @CK, @SQ, he can't have @HA as well as that would be a 1nt opener|pg||
nt|oliverc: I wonder what 1@S-1NT-2@C-2@D would have shown|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: but he was doubtless going up with the @HK anyway, even if not sure|pg||
nt|athene: (declarer was)|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: Well that makes the match nicely poised with 2 Boards to go|pg||
nt|athene: yes, or respond 1NT intending to bid 3@D over 2@C, if you think you are worth it - the point being you don't lose hearts|pg||
nt|oliverc: right|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  @c lead let it through|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 3NT has the best chance - likely club lead|pg||
nt|finch: no, the later ruff discard West conceded let it through|pg||

nt|thegarve:  3NT makes sense if its natural|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|thegarve:  England striding on|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3@S is quite aggressive but they still have lots of room to do their little dance and stop in 4@H|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ady: club lead in OR  and later a ruff and discard|pg||
nt|ady: this looks like down 2|pg||
nt|thegarve:  NI down by 1 and Scotland up by 4 so its down to the wire|pg||
nt|athene: but south must like his @DK and @CA|pg||
nt|athene: @SX @HKQx @DAQxxx @Cxxxx hardly impossible for south's bidding?|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he needs the @DJ with all that to make slam good|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: @SA, @DK, spade ruff, then @DAQ pitching a club, and 4th diamond|pg||
nt|athene: if east follows you pitch another club|pg||
nt|athene: when he shows out you can ruff and ruff another spade|pg||
nt|oliverc: works for me :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: likely 2 off, yes|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: nothing too interesting here - should be flat|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: as with 6@S a moment ago, 6NT was objectively better|pg||

nt|athene: declarer went for the spade ruffs in the other room and ended with 11 (although when he led the last diamond, east ruffed, according to the movie, so he cld have pitched @C loser ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: swing|pg||
nt|finch: um, what's wrong with 3@H on the West cards, assuming it's forcing?|pg||
nt|finch: if partner bid 3NT over it you'd be quite pleased|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  3@h is a bit presumptuous, especially if 3@h is GF|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our appreciation to the Polish Bridge Union for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. As always, Slawek Latala and Ryszard Kielczewki have been instrumental in setting up a fine show|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: 4@H very pushy   |pg||
nt|athene: 6@H looks likely|pg||
nt|athene: @CK lead will make things easy for declarer, giving a pitch for the @S10|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C weakish both majors...if 3@H is invitational he will bid it, with two aces|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|Walddk4: Play will resume in about 15 minutes with segment 3. Hope to see you all back then|pg||
nt|athene: but it's hard to criticize E-W for missing this one|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: but without that, the @DQ comes down so there are two pitches for dummy's clubs|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c2|nt|thegarve:  won't be slayed too much by that lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|finch: West should have worked out what to do on this card before playing the third club - she knew someone was going to ruff it|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: of course 4@H doesn't make :) you must lose a spade and three clubs|pg||
