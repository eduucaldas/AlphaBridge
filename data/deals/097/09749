mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lc: While we wait, I want to thank Catalina Robles, doing a great job at a tough job -- sitting tableside in Vegas.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|lc: It is tough on the back, eyes, brain, to type in the bids, plays, etc.|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|lc: 2@H=4th suit GF, no doubt.  North just happens to have real @H.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|lc: So, 2NT, then 3@H, I'd guess.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: I suppose there is a mild danger of getting above game, but BW would stop any pair from reaching slam.|pg||
nt|lc: You wouldn't want to reach 5@H with the 4-1 break, but I suppose you'd survive.|pg||
nt|petergill: Thomas Bessis in his twenties is the 102nd ranked bridge player in the world, according to the WBF at http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3470. Thomas is a current ...|pg||
nt|petergill: World Champion, winning the World Transnational Open Teams in Shanghai, also he won the European Open Teams in 2007 with his dad Michel, and according to my female French sources ...|pg||
nt|petergill: he's a real spunk or hunk or hot (my translation to English is not perfect). |pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|lc: So, now North has shown real @H.|pg||
nt|lc: 3NT, by Greco, I'd think.|pg||
nt|lc: North hasn't shown 5@H, and even so, South's hand looks very notrumpy.|pg||
nt|lc: Which reminds me of another word ("notrumpy") that my spell-checker rejects.|pg||
nt|lc: My spell-checker doesn't really understand my bridge writing.|pg||
nt|petergill: but it's Michel Bessis and John Diamond on webcam now |pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|lc: I've taught it that Stayman -- is a word.  But, yesterday, in my article, when North "Staymaned" into something, it got rejected.|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, back at the ranch...|pg||
nt|petergill: at http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/webcam/1/table1.jpg|pg||
nt|petergill: double n perhaps? Staymanned?|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose Greco thinks 3@H does show 5.  4@C must be a control-bid raise of @H.|pg||
nt|lc: If Greco wanted to play @S, he would have bid 3@S.|pg||
nt|lc: It is too late for !|pg||
nt|lc: TOo late for @C|pg||
nt|lc: So, this has to be a control-bid agreeing @H.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lc: But, I don't get it.  Too soft -- no aces.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: 4@S now RKC in @H.|pg||
nt|lc: Most experts use 1-over the implies trump suit as RKC.|pg||
mb|5C|nt|lc: Since @H are implies, Diamond thinks this is RKC for @H. |pg||
nt|lc: 5@C shows 1KC.|pg||
nt|petergill: @H9 is a good card if they stop in 5@H |pg||
nt|lc: So they will stop in 5@H -- and survive since the 4-1 break is the right way.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: So, a fortunate 450 will got to N-S.  No punishment for getting a bit too high.|pg||
nt|petergill: Greco's slow pass of 5@H reminded me of the TV reality show hosts who hesitate before they announce the winner  |pg||
nt|lc: Presumably the N-S players no explaining the bids to E-W.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lc: Normally, they don't ask during the auction -- just slows things down.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|lc: Although, with screens, I always ask for written explanations as the auction develops.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzps: yeah and usually they just alert moving there hands and opp know what they mean|pg||
nt|lc: Reasonable lead -- try to cash 2 @D tricks in case dummy has @CAK and declarer is 1-1 in minors.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lc: No possible reason to ever misguess the @H.|pg||
nt|lc: No communication trouble, this will soon be over.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lc: Easley (Blackwood) would be happy.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|lc: His convention worked.|pg||
mc|11|nt|lc: Although Easley didn't know from RKC or Kickback 1-over.|pg||

nt|lc: Some in field (the wild men) will upgrade to 2NT with West hand.|pg||
nt|lc: I don't see it. To me, it is 19.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lc: Anyway, they will all reach 3NT.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|lc: Now 2N-3N|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: @H lead, and looks like 1 too many aces to knock out.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lc: Dec can't hold up in @H -- so no matter which ace he knocks out first, he is down.|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: J or shortness|pg||
nt|lc: He needs 4-4 @H.  Or the wrong lead.|pg||
nt|petergill: Eric Greco often partners Geoff Hampson, who is playing iwth Eric Rodwell today. John Diamond won the World Junior Teams for USA in 1991, anchoring the team (with Brian Platnick, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Debbie Rosenberg and others) by playing every board in the Final, then stopped bigtime bridge for many years until a successful recent comeback, 2nd in the 2009 Vanderbilt for ...|pg||
nt|petergill: instance.  |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|lc: Any lucky (systemic-wise) E-W that play from East and get a @S lead will win a ton of imps.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lc: However, it rates to be played by West at just about every table.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|petergill: I agree|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|lc: And the defense is easy and automatic -- tons of -100's on the scoresheet for sure.|pg||
nt|lc: it feels depressing for E-W, but they will have a TON of company.|pg||

mb|p|nt|lc: Will South open light in 3rd Vul?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|po-s: IF, just if West had begun with a diamond it isnÂ´t sure that North had taken the ace|pg||
nt|lc: Yes.|pg||
nt|lc: yes to the light opener.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lc: All of my students and I think a lot of experts would overcall 2@D.  Not me, though.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|lc: I don't like 2-level overcalls with 5-card suits and Qxx in opps major.  That's just me.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Now, in balancing seat -- okay.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzps: This session they r playing 9 rounds, in 4 th sessionn 10 rounds|pg||
nt|lc: South is delighted to be extricated from 1@S.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|petergill: Bd 20: Quantin from France sneaked 3NT home against Eric Rodwell by playing a diamond ducked by Rodwell at Trick 2, back to spades, then North got squeezed in 3 suits on the run of ...|pg||
nt|petergill: the spades. |pg||
nt|lc: Wow.|pg||
nt|lc: And I said the defense was easy :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|petergill: Defense ... easy ...oxymoron?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|petergill: I think oxymoron means that the adjective and noun do not go together|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petergill: I might be wrong about that|pg||
pc|s5|nt|po-s: I think it is a kind of contradiction|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petergill: Can 2@D be made?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|lc: I'm afraid to say after I said 3NT was cold on  20.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|petergill: I can see 7 tricks|pg||
nt|lc: It looks complex -- and has looked complex since Trick 1.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|lc: That's code for "damned if I know."|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|po-s: Larry, if North ducks a diamond I think North will be squeezed|pg||
nt|lc: It looks like there was some "back - and - forth."|pg||
nt|lc: P.O. -- take over please  :) :)     Your floor...|pg||
pc|h9|nt|petergill: We vote for -1|pg||
nt|lc: What we, kemo sabe?|pg||
nt|petergill: as long as North doesn't ruff @H9|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h6|nt|lc: I see N has 2 @D tricks. |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|po-s: In 2D if declarer ducks the heart def can take two ruffs, two clubs and a heart|pg||
nt|lc: But, if he ducked the @H, dec would play 3 rounds of @S and get @D at ebnd.|pg||
mc|8|nt|lc: I think he was cold at the end.|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: closing table now ill be back in a minute|pg||
nt|po-s: the spade goes on the last heart I think|pg||
nt|lc: This is why G-D invented double-dummy software.|pg||
