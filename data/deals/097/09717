mb|2D|nt|lc: I played every year from maybe 1981-2004 -- and maybe broke even financially, but wasn't worth the gray hair.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: However, with a field of this quality, perhaps less of a lottery|pg||
nt|lc: A very very heavy 2@D by Bates.|pg||
nt|lc: Looks more like a STRONG 2@D to me than a WEAK 2.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: You need to be sitting in the right direction on more than 50% of the critical hands. If there are 12 slam hands and they are all against you it is hard to win|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|bjacobs: Right ... whereas in teams, you have teammates who can square the board|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And if they don't, then you deserve to lose thei mps|pg||
nt|lc: 3@C obviously not FEATURE. Must mean something.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: shortage?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I hope it means good hand good suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|d|nt|lc: If South can open 2@D with such strenght, then I suppose North has to try for game.|pg||
nt|lc: Delayed entry by Gitelman with a takeout X.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: It is aafter all only on a heart finesse|pg||
nt|lc: Whatever North wants, South surely must think he has enough for game.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ritong: anyways, 2NT is a brave bid  probably they agreed on heavy weak twos|pg||
nt|lc: 3@S presumably showing values -- now 3NT by North.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And how will that go?|pg||
nt|lc: Might Moss X to get a @S lead against eventual 3NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: How about 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: B North|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3NT is intriguing|pg||
nt|lc: A @S lead would actually be great for the defense -- takes out the entry to the @D.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: What about @CK lead?  So much depends on that @C9|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Needs Club Club Diamond and heart through|pg||
nt|lc: With no X of 3NT, Gitelman surely won't lead a @S.  Presumably the a high @C.|pg||
nt|mslair: compton will surely bid 3n.t|pg||
nt|lc: We never did find out what 3@C means?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: 3NT looks easy to bid here|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lc: Hmmm.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpt: Nice pass by Fred|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is THAT code?|pg||
nt|lc: "Hmmm" means, I don't understand and am surprised.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So polite ...|pg||
nt|ritong: who would not be|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Bates looks more than puzzled|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@h wins the award for the unguessable bid of the week|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Got you to spring to life Henri|pg||
nt|lc: I never like when my partners make such bids out of the blue.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: It is very hard to see the  explanations - often just gestured and not written|pg||
nt|mslair: compton was looking for bates to have a stiff spade is the solution?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|d|nt|vugraphzpt: Moss has had enough of the comedy|pg||
nt|lc: 3@D was presumably NF, so all of this seems strange.|pg||
nt|lc: So, 5@D is likely the final resting spot, maybe X.|pg||
nt|mslair: Moss wants to make sure everying gets Xed  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: "Final resting spot" ... sounds like a grave, which is not a bad metaphor, given location of @HK|pg||
nt|lc: 5@D looks to be -1, unless declarer can set up @C for @H pitch -- not likely.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: I'd guess a @H lead, in fact.|pg||
nt|lc: THis auction made no sense.|pg||
nt|ritong: brad is not in merciful mood|pg||
nt|ritong: rarely is, by the way|pg||
nt|lc: So far, Gitelman-Moss are having a nice session (which often means your opps are helping you some.)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I suppose he saw the non-forcing 3@D and has guessed that N/S's wheels have come off|pg||
nt|ritong: go gitelmoss!:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I believe Brad has a view that doubling is beneficial. If it yields an extra 100 that would be 69 imps or 7% of the leading score|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzpt: Bates grimacing as though in pain|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/2009/PAIRS1S.htm for the standings after the first set|pg||
nt|lc: Well, it was a VUL game on a finesse (admitedly not good when East X'ed 3@D).|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|ritong: well, sionce he can t have a better hand for his opening, he certainly is not super happy|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
mc|10|nt|lc: Bates-Compton not really a regular partnership, in case anyone is wondering.|pg||
nt|lc: Roger's (Bates) regular partner is Alan Sontag.|pg||
nt|lc: For another few weeks, any way.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh?|pg||

nt|lc: A story for after the round. Back to bridge.  :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bjacobs: Thanks to all the specs enlightening me ...|pg||
nt|lc: Is that an upgradable 14?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: 4@H>>|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|vugraphzpt: Delayed entry into the auction by Bates|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|lc: Moss presumably could have Texased directly to 4@H, so by going slowly, I can only preesume he was thinking of slam.|pg||
nt|lc: Surely slam is possible opposite perfect cards (like @HAxxx  @CKx and a spade cards).|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Whatever 2NT meant, presumably 3@H didn't show what Moss had in mind for slam purposes.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: guess a perfecto would start with a superaccept|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lc: South's X will presumably allow Gitelman to guess the @S right to make 11 tricks.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Tick|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lc: A sexy @C spot -- presumably not systemic.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|lc: And a falsecard by North.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, good luck getting the club suit right after that start|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Enough trumps not to need clubs|pg||
nt|lc: I think he has to get @C right -- can't afford to finesse into North.|pg||

nt|vugraphzpt: I bet raise|pg||
nt|lc: Some Norths will actually preempt at FAV.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I know people who would sooner die than declare 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Moss is a renowned gambler|pg||
nt|lc: That is how sick preempting has become these days.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|lc: Other than the @H suit, things are very favorable for E-W.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: So we picked the opening bid - well done team|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Actually, a LOW @H lead would be much better than the normal @H10.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I win|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|nt|lc: It will go @H10, @HJ, !Q -- and then East's @H6 becomes a card late in the day.|pg||
nt|lc: So, they play Rusinow, it seems.  (second from honors).|pg||
nt|ritong: for people wondering about the 3NT bid, let s say that brad simply bets his pard will not make exactly eight tricks|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|lc: Declare will need the @SK and @D's right just to start -- and they are!|pg||
nt|lc: He would have liked the @HJ to hold.  Now he needs miracles -- but may get them.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|lc: If he lays down @DA, South should falsecard.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lc: The @DJ would have been better.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ritong: a bit groggy, perhaps|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|lc: That would have created a losing option for declarer.|pg||
nt|mslair: dia 10 would have been heady on 1st round|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I believe the falsecard should not and would not work - this is a restricted choice position|pg||
nt|lc: When no J/10 fell, declarer had no choice but to hope for Kx -- as he did.|pg||
nt|lc: If J/10 fell, he'd have had option to play the QUEEN next -- a losing play.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I think ducking the first heart would have been better|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Suit now frozen|pg||
nt|ritong: then chersh @h 6 and hope for an other good new|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|bjacobs: K10, KJ is twice as likely as J10, even forgetting the falsecard|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|lc: There is that @H6 -- a big card.|pg||
nt|lc: South knows from the spots that East has it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Bates leans back in his chair and isnt happy|pg||
nt|ritong: he just wants to leave this table|pg||
nt|lc: He can place almost all the cards, now.|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, and knows it s over|pg||
nt|ritong: very cruel|pg||
nt|lc: This will be a very large pick up for E-W -- having a nice 9 boards  -- probably +600-700 by now on the set.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Would ANYONE have led 4th best?  I know one person, now passed away, that would have led @H4|pg||
nt|lc: Who is that?  John Lowenthal?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Don't know him :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Mahmoud Wigoder next|pg||
nt|lc: Tim Seres?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Know OF him, of course|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|bjacobs: Correct - Tim|pg||
pc|s6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lc: Had to go Aussie... :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He was fanatical about ignoring honour sequences|pg||
nt|ritong: "did you see that" fred thinks|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
mc|9|nt|lc: Could not have Bates at leas exited in @S and made declarer guess @C?|pg||
