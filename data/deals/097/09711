mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: one club doubled, anyone?|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes|pg||
nt|dburn: not for Helness, who will run|pg||
nt|chessmaste: This may be bloody|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Even thought North holds four clubs, he knows that West must hold a real stack because of his pass, so he tries his luck elsewhere.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Her pass|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, sorry. Not one of my strongpoints.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I think E/W would be happier defending 1@D doubled given they have not bid 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: not all that easy for East to go on, but on the auction the @cQ had appreciated in value considerably|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|dburn: the question is: could West have made a forcing pass over 1@d?|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was difficult for West to think of defending 1@D, perhaps, with those clubds no use there. Still, it would have been best. |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|dburn: I mean, if West had @cJ1098xx and nothing, she would presumably still pass over 1@c doubled and pass over 1@d|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, it's tricky.|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, some Wests may open the bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: and probably play in game if they do that|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: helness playing with the 2 played tricks|pg||
nt|mittmouse: y the strong clubbers will open 2c|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|brolucius: Not much of a hand, though, with no aces.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mittmouse: good shift|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|dburn: well, the defence has so far tried every suit except the one in which they opened the bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: but this diamond is a good idea, to tangle communications|pg||
nt|brolucius: Other room had the same auction except that East raised to 3NT.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|brolucius: Of course the other BBO table reflects only one of many results against which this result will be cross-IMPed.|pg||
nt|mittmouse: good play by myers if she falls for the grrek gift in diamonds she loses her hand|pg||
nt|dburn: but that nine of clubs is a dismal sight for Jill Meyers, who knows now that she could have made a game|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h6|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|d9|pc|d7|pg||
nt|dburn: thoughtful of Helgemo to play it, really|pg||
nt|brolucius: The appearance of the @C9 told declarer that she could overtake in clubs. South might have considered playing low.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Still, I dare say West would overtake anyway.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|mittmouse: y i agree|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
mc|9|nt|chessmaste: I fear this will prove to be a modest result for E/W|pg||
pg||
qx|o5|st||md|3SKJT32H8DJ4CKQ964,S8HQJ9DT9732CT732,SAQ94HKT732D5CAJ5,S765HA654DAKQ86C8|sv|n|nt|brolucius: And yet they did little wrong.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Indeed|pg||
nt|chessmaste: A regulation game for N/S|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|chessmaste: With possibilities for E/W also|pg||
nt|dburn: passing instead of opening the West hand may be considered only a little wrong, but...|pg||
nt|brolucius: I keep on being asked 'Are running scores available?' Naturally, I haven't the faintest idea. Does anyone know?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|chessmaste: if they do they aren't saying|pg||
nt|dburn: ...it is probably not playing with the room at this level of competition|pg||
mb|5D|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=39&Itemid=50|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Cracking auction|pg||
nt|dburn: I imagine that, with vast amounts of money at issue, running scores will not be available if only for security reasons|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is the site address and the scores are posted after each round. (Thanks to Krishna)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|mittmouse: players never save in 6 although here it would be very profitable|pg||
nt|dburn: by "each round", do you mean each three-board round, or each session?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was told 'round', so it is unclear.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: There is nothing on the site yet|pg||
nt|dburn: as I say, I would be very surprised to see scores updated in running|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, it is a bit early in the day to be worrying about overall scores.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h6|nt|chessmaste: Yes, plenty of time for them to worry later|pg||
pc|sT|pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: A kibitzer asks if a negative double is better on the South hand. I very much prefer 2@S when 5-5 in the blacks.  |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dburn: meanwhile, this board will have to be thrown our for being illegal, since there are 19 trumps but 21 tricks|pg||
mc|11|nt|brolucius: Otherwise hard to find a 5-3 fit there.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Larry Cohen will be dismayed|pg||
pg||
qx|o6|st||md|4SAKJ72HT3DA43C863,ST6HQ654DJ95CKT54,S94HAKJ97DKQ2CQ72,SQ853H82DT876CAJ9|sv|e|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Although H&H seemed to have done nothing very special on the board, they will probably score nicely for 5@S making.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|dburn: sure - some might defend only 5@d doubled|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|nt|dburn: here is a routine game on which no one will win or lose a lot of IMPs|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: We will be back after this board when every table is done with round 2|pg||
nt|dburn: although some amusement may be occasioned if Charles Wigoder is South|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some kibitzers say "Bidding wsa normal to 5@S."  Yes, it was. But with so many tables in play, you can bet that some of the auctions will take different paths.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dburn: since Zia and Charles decided to play a 2NT opening at favourable vulnerability as 12-14 balanced|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: whether Zia convinced his partner to abandon this rash scheme on the 11-hour flight from London to Las Vegas, I do not know|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|mc|9|nt|chessmaste: They did not do well in the teams|pg||
nt|brolucius: Appropriate that they should play 'roulette' methods.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: too many 2NT openings perhaps|pg||
nt|dburn: in truth, though, the method is not completely ridiculous|pg||
nt|brolucius: "You alerted 2NT?"  "Yes, it's weak."|pg||
nt|dburn: but before Zia left London, he asked me to generate several hundred random hands to prove that the method would be a disaster|pg||
nt|dburn: so I generated several hundred random hands, and the great man scanned them solemnly, looked at me, and said "it's not so crazy after all, is it?"|pg||
