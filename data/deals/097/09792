mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: all south can do now is bid 2h then the question is will east back in with a takeout double|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3c!! this is absurd|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: well n/s have gone neative by playing in a 4/3 fit at the three level instead of a 5/2 fit at the 2 level|pg||
nt|lestergold: what did 2c mean?|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely notm clubs?|pg||

nt|lestergold: especially wuith the defenders playing aces on air like they were going out of fashion|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Petro has a carryover of 7.2 IMPs to be precise|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|nt|lestergold: so 2 dim losersbecame one with a little helopf from the defence|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mareczek: here also 7,2 carryover|pg||
nt|col3435: I think the usual way of playing a semi-forcing NT is that you rebid 2@c if you would accept a game invitation|pg||
nt|lestergold: now all declarer has to do is guess the cluibs|pg||
nt|mareczek: those 0,2 is sometimes valid|pg||
nt|col3435: (but in that case South needs to take preference to @h rather than raising @c)|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: i doubt if he will succeed in doing that|pg||
nt|mareczek: in a quaterfinal Petro lost the match by 7 imps against Olsztyn|pg||
nt|mareczek: but the carry over was 7,2 ...|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mareczek: so they passed to final four|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe declarer can cross ruff this and not lose a club after all|pg||
nt|lestergold: in any case im surprised at the looseness of the defence - perhaps est rose with dim ace because he could 'count' 5 tricks for the defence|pg||
