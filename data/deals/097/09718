nt|bobh1: @ss usually wins|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: 5 H down 1 5S likely makes|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|henryb: North has to underlead the @h to beat 5@s; 4@h is cold and cannot do better|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: looks like it takes a @h underlead to beat 5@s|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb: tough to find the vul save|pg||
nt|bobh1: they go quietly|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzps: Levin will not be happy at trick one|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Zhao asks for the convention card|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: studies|pg||
nt|bobh1: T showing 0 or 2 higher i guess|pg||
nt|bobh1: so this layout is possible and zhao will play for it|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: He'll be happier til he realizes he had a down 1 save|pg||
nt|bobh1: no big deal only overtricks at stake|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Screen down Zhao asking Weinstein about the 10. Told 3rd best possible|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h9|mc|11|nt|vugraphzps: Levin asks to see the hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: in fact he was never getting a @d unless he underled his A|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Realizes that 5H down 1|pg||
pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bobh1: lots of tricks in notrump|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|bobh1: on the margin of slam|pg||
nt|bobh1: can be made i think|pg||
nt|henryb: I am a great believer in "raise on three", or rather do not rebid 1NT with three card support for partner's major|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Levin leaning back contemplating|pg||
nt|bobh1: with small dub in @ss most would agree with you|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: I agree witth Henry. Always raise unless the hand looks too NoTrumpy|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzps: Now Weinsteins turn|pg||
nt|bobh1: dont think that will get them there|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: 3 little hearts is such a huge flaw from Weinsteins point of View|pg||
nt|henryb: even then it may be right: particularly since if you always raise on three, partner will not remove 1N with a five card suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: no @d spot|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|henryb: but AKAJ and not a collection of quacks|pg||
nt|bobh1: very well judged|pg||
nt|bobh1: i'm surprised; most would shrug and say "i only had a 12-count"|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Levin doesnt look happy that the decision  hasn't been made yet:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: wrong to bid Bob|pg||
nt|bobh1: can he really not get to slam now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: They might get lucky|pg||
nt|bobh1: i doubt it|pg||
nt|henryb: Levin rarely looks happy|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: curious to see  if they can get out in 5NT|pg||
nt|henryb: sure: Levin could bid 5@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think levins just wondering which slam to bid|pg||
nt|henryb: or even 5N on this auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: 5@d is Natural I imagine|pg||
nt|henryb: but I think the @dQ will persuade him to bid 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: though some play that you show Aces here on the way to 6 just in case|pg||
nt|henryb: partner could have @dQxx and @c Qx, which would make 6@d a much better contract|pg||
nt|bobh1: normally 5n here would be pick a slam|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: 5@d accepted the slam try|pg||
nt|henryb: I don't think so after you invited|pg||
nt|bobh1: levin's not taking any chances or he's concluded that 6n is best|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Zhao asking about the auction. Weinstein explaining|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Weinstein will not like the dummy is my prediction|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzps: Blinks a few times and finally thanks his partner|pg||
nt|henryb: Apparently Zia is also in 6N|pg||
nt|bobh1: he will smile after he rides the @s 9 and it holds|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: lets out a deep breath|pg||
nt|henryb: is that the right play?|pg||
nt|bobh1: 5@d was gutsy|pg||
nt|henryb: probably. with the club lead it gives good chances to get to 11 tricks, and where there are 11 there are often 12|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: no reaction from Zhao|pg||
nt|henryb: inscrutable Chinese|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Does have a contemplative look about him |pg||
nt|vugraphzps: thinking hard|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: 5  min warning|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: time pressure|pg||
nt|bobh1: to me double-hooking the @ss seems best|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|henryb: Zia got a @h lead and imediately played three @d|pg||
nt|bobh1: to steve also i guess|pg||
nt|henryb: he will make 13 now|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Jack would be the play from KJxx on the next spade|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
