pc|c5|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bjacobs: Perhaps West is weary at the end of a LONG event.  But there doesn't seem to be any reason for ducking the heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: especially holding the 9|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bjacobs: What's more, with South having @SA and good hearts, it was fairly clear partner had @DA|pg||

mb|r|nt|bjacobs: Not on this lie of the cards|pg||
nt|bobh1: foul break in trumps|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bjacobs: Anyone play redouble here as showing honour-low in spades?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: no|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So what DOES the redouble show?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: but I do play it is a good 2 card raise|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think many would play it shows the ace or king|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "good 2-card raise" - "honour low" : Play Spot the Difference|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|nt|vugraphzpr: dont need an honor to do it|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: just points|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: 9-11|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|bjacobs: oh all right ... "good" does not refer to the spade holding ... you win|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The reason I like it showing an honour is that it really helps partner on lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: Martin Dekniff is a former Swedish Jr team member who gave up Bridge and started playing poker|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: He is one of the most feared players in the game|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You would only do that for the money, I reckon|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Such an inferior game|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: now he has taken up Bridge again|pg||
nt|bobh1: he has a tempting hand depending on what redouble means|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: it looks like his K's might be well-placed|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpr: He won the Bellagio 25000 buyin a few years ago. Arguably the toughest event on the schedule|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bjacobs: was it on the TV?  You know "World Poker Tour" or whatever?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: yes|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bobh1: he will have to take the @d finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: possibly marked by levin's dbl?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It helps, but even without it, what is the alternative, when he discovers the spade break?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bjacobs: Might as well invest an extra 50 to get 140|pg||
