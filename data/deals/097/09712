nt|brolucius: Raising to 2@H on trhee cards is popular in England and I like it. Good to see some US players agreeing with the idea.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: technical difficulties at the other table |pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: computer froze|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: std here now David|pg||
nt|wordmew: down 1 looks inevitable|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: most good pairs have been doing it for 20+ years|pg||
nt|brolucius: If North did not hold five hearts himself, he would have to mark time (perhaps with 3NT, or 2NT forcing) to check how many hearts South held.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chessmaste: A fast one down now|pg||
nt|wordmew: that's the way to do it quickly|pg||

nt|chessmaste: As it happens I will be In France tomorrow|pg||
nt|dburn: have they been warned?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: make sure you bring 4 card support Mark|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|chessmaste: they are erecting barricades at the boder even as we speak|pg||
nt|mslair: just back   had to fix my own lunch:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: get an au pair:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I thought he might double. They must play that correcting to 2@D over 2@C does not show extra values.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|brolucius: Three-level bids, of course.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: or it does and Seamon doesnt care|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: Cohler seems to think it does otherwise easy pass|pg||
nt|po-s: he does have some extras|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: better play trump|pg||
mb|4D|nt|brolucius: Yes, not so bad.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 4@D by North, presumably.|pg||
nt|mslair: 4d:)|pg||
nt|dburn: West, on the other hand, does not really have a 4@d bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: I like 3H just in case partner wants to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|po-s: better chance to make by South anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: wont let me play the cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: 2 rounds of Hearts so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: Pilon in with the ace|pg||
nt|dburn: some pairs might use 2NT by North as lebensohl in this type of sequence|pg||
nt|mslair: 3d-p-4d|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|brolucius: South needs to ruff two spades and the defenders need to stop this.|pg||
nt|dburn: so that 3@C would be constructive, in which case 3@d would be forcing|pg||
pc|h6|nt|chessmaste: Especially now|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chessmaste: Very modest defence|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|po-s: better be careful Mark if you´r heading for France|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dburn: but there is no evidence that North-South have such an agreement (and quite right too, for the notion is particularly barmy)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|brolucius: South was marked with a likely 4-6 shape in spades-diamonds, after that bidding and was likely to need spade ruffs.|pg||

nt|chessmaste: true - but it's only for one night (although the restaurant does have two Michelin **) |pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Pity you can't afford it.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|po-s: he´s invited surely|pg||
mb|2D|nt|chessmaste: That has never stopped me before:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brolucius: Or does Bridge Magazine operate the same sort of expenses schedule as our Houses of Parliament? |pg||
nt|chessmaste: I'm working on it|pg||

nt|brolucius: Perhaps you will pay £6000 to your own brother for cleaning expenses, following Gordon Brown's lead?|pg||

pc|dA|pc|h2|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||

nt|vugraphzpr: next round we have Seamon Cohler against Mike Moss and Gunnar Hallberg. Should be a fun round|pg||
