nt|lc: Security reasons.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzps: Welcome back|pg||
nt|lc: This looks like 3NT or more likely, 4@S for N-S.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1N|nt|lc: A fearless 1NT by Bob.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Lall will surely drive to game.|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|petergill: The webcam might update when the players arrive at the table, or it might not. If it is working, I will identify who the players are on the webcam. |pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|lc: "Everyone" plays "system on" after a 1NT overcall.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Lall could have shown his @C, but elected to treat his hand as balanced via 3NT.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|nt|lc: Hamman will have no reason to remove with 4-3-3-3-.|pg||
nt|lc: With all the @D right, this will make even with a @S misguess.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|lc: In fact, after @D10 holds, dec might just drive out @HA for 9 sure ones.|pg||
nt|petergill: On webcam1, Michel Bessis is the balding one, and Bob Hamman has the grey hair|pg||
nt|lc: Nice.|pg||
nt|lc: Best player of all time, and the adj for him is "grey hair."|pg||
nt|lc: I'm sure Bob will appreciate that. :)|pg||
nt|lc: At least you didn't say "the heavy one."|pg||
nt|petergill: at http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/webcam/1/table1.jpg|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|lc: Knowing that the @D are right, dec has several sure paths to 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|petergill: the webcam shows Michel Bessis on the left and Bob Hamman on the right|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|lc: :) much nicer.|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h8|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose if you use "the player with the big stomach" -- you can use it for too many players in this event.|pg||
nt|lc: Am i going to get thrown off the broadcast crew?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|lc: One thing about the screens, is that when you are on defense, all you can see is your partner's stomach.|pg||
nt|petergill: Please stay and broadcast forever, Larry|pg||

nt|lc: I suspect a heavy 2@S for this pair.|pg||
nt|lc: For me, personally, 1@S since my weak-2's aren't this strong.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lc: Some stodgy people out there would be deterred from preempting because of the side @HAJx.|pg||
mb|d|nt|lc: So, a more modern 1@S by Lall.|pg||
mb|r|nt|petergill: NS moving towards Larry's style now that we are in the 21st century|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lc: Some of Hamman's methods are still 20th century (like Standard Attitude).|pg||
nt|lc: Most pairs play East's jump as weak/shape after the XX.|pg||
nt|lc: I could easily see lots of doubled final contracts around the room on this deal.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Hemant Lall now wishing that he'd opened 2@S, perhaps?|pg||
nt|lc: Yes.|pg||
nt|lc: Many partnerships would not know if they are now in a force.|pg||
nt|lc: Through what level does XX set up a force?  It's probably not near the front of most partnerships' playbooks.|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D (N) Pass 3@S (S) - would that be stronger or weaker than 3@S by South directly over 3@C?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lc: I doubt Hamman-Lall have discsussed this auction.|pg||
nt|lc: If pass is forcing, then direct action by South would tend to be weakest.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Would you bid 2@S or 2@H or Dbl on Michel Bessis's hand over 1@S?|pg||
nt|lc: If Lall bids 4@S now, he will surely play in 8@S.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|lc: There we go.  One of many X contracts, I suspect.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: I feel bad for the Swedish Junior team -- having to compete for air time against the world's best.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lc: So, how many down will this be?|pg||
nt|petergill: http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/webcam/1/table1.jpg to see how two of the players look now|pg||
nt|lc: We start with a sure loser in each suit and go from there.|pg||
nt|lc: Is Lall crying?|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: He is looking dummy with his hand in his head|pg||
nt|lc: We need a photo of East and South.  With East smiling.|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Not so happy seems|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lc: This is why E-W should have a weak jump (not that East was so weak) available after the XX.  It can really create havoc.|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps I should have listened to Larry and opened 2@S like he predicted, thinks South|pg||
nt|lc: Surely, 2@S would have avoided this mess.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|nt|petergill: Yes, removing the two level from the opponents often causes chaos|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|lc: So, aside from the loser in each suit, it seems an additional trump trick for sure, at least -300.|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S over 3@S was pretty bold. |pg||
nt|lc: Maybe he thought 3@S forcing, but I can't see why it would be.|pg||
nt|lc: Or, maybe he liked his @Cxxx -- thinking it opposite shortness.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s8|nt|petergill: Yes|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lc: Which it was, in a way.  But not the way he hoped.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lc: We call this a "son-in-law" dummy. |pg||
nt|lc: Not what I had in mind.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|petergill: NS might not have enough partnership experience to know if 3@s on this auction shows 3 or 2 card support. |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lc: Declarer may need to shorten himself with somoe @D ruffs to avoid -3.|pg||
nt|petergill: Hence the early @D play|pg||
nt|po-s: Son and dad also use oldfashiond count|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|lc: Most French use Std carding.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|lc: And Std bidding|pg||
nt|lc: Easy to follow.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h4|pc|sA|nt|lc: Of course, one man's standard is the other man's....|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|petergill: West's  Dbl of 1@S drew a good result - as West, would you Dbl, bid 2@S or 2@H, Larry?. |pg||
nt|lc: Of all the countries in Europe, I most prefer to play against the French.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lc: Not because they aren't good -- but because I am familiar with the methods.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lc: I'd choose the one that got the good result. :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|petergill: Least favourite country to play then? Sweden? New Zealand?|pg||
nt|lc: Honestly, I'm not sure what I would have done with West.|pg||
nt|lc: As to which country...|pg||
nt|lc: New Zealand isn't exactly what I'd call European, but their system is a nightmare to play against!|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lc: Strong passes, ferts, all sorts of annoying stuff.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|s7|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cK|mc|8|nt|lc: I am somewhat familiar with the other systems, Italian, Polish, Swedish -- but still, unless you face them all the time, there are disadvantages with unfamiliarity.|pg||
pg||
qx|o12|st||md|2SAT942HQT2DJ6CT82,SJ8765HAK7DK97CAJ,SK3H96543DAQ842C4,SQHJ8DT53CKQ97653|sv|n|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|lc: Just because I am used to "Standard American," doesn't mean there is a "Standard" world system...|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@S looks like a transfer to clubs|pg||
nt|lc: So, whenever you play outside your country there are unfamliiarity issues.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|lc: In Cavendish (this event) not much is allowed.|pg||
mb|3H|an|singleton !s|nt|lc: Surely a good 3NT here for E-W -- likely to be reached.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|lc: Although, 3NT can be defeate on this layout -- but it won't.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: (@SK, @S, @S, @D -- down 1).|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H = singleton spade, to reduce the chance of a Dbl for a lead|pg||
nt|lc: Prsumably a red-suit lead and 9 top tricks (10 with a @D lead).|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lc: Very nice idea.  Bid the suit you don't have the singleton in.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|lc: So, only 4-0 @C would bother declarer.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h3|pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|nt|petergill: 3@S might be "not sure about 3NT" then 3NT = singleton honour in @S, perhaps|pg||
nt|lc: Well done, but I suspect fairly normal across the field.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s4|pc|d7|nt|lc: So, we have 15 more deals (5 rounds) in this session. Then 30 tonight.  I'm worn out just thinking about it.|pg||
mc|10|nt|lc: Players will have maybe 45 minutes break in between. Makes me glad I am sitting at home, peacefully.|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Ok will reopen soon with rd 24|pg||
nt|petergill: To me, a direct 1NT - 3NT has some appeal - it might even preempt the opponents out of a making 4@H or 4@S contract. |pg||
