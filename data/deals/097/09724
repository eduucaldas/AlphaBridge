nt|vugraphzpt: Its correct people|pg||
nt|ritong: fred takes charge|pg||
mb|3N|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpt: Lots  of alerting so maybe systemic|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|bjacobs: Is this a variant of the12-14 2NT opening we saw before?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: phew|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzpt: How silly of me to assume it was going to be passed out|pg||
nt|ritong: was worrying about brad s pass|pg||
nt|ritong: after that, cops are called, etc  bad music|pg||
mb|d|nt|bjacobs: There's something curious about all this.  Could it be that the North Americans, barred from a lot of conventions, are reduced to weird semi-psychic natural bids?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Brad thinking - not of redoubling I hope|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|vugraphzpt: Can he hold this to -3 is the question|pg||
nt|mslair: he will with ease|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: West thinking of overtaking and a club switch perhaps|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
nt|mslair: and then only 2 down|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|s2|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ritong: time for wrang to establish what is going on|pg||
nt|mslair: looking like 2 down|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: This smells like -2 as on the fourth diamond the trump or a loser disappears|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Needed to establish third club trick while he had the spade entry I think|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And a nice pick up for N/S, but Queen Victoria would say: "We are not amused"|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h9|nt|ritong: well imps do not grow on trees|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|ritong: although it is rare to watch fred jumping out like that|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sometimes they do, but more often, yes, perhaps you have to make them happen|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bjacobs: I get the sense that N/S think they need this sort of action to get in the money ... eg Moss's double of 5@D before|pg||
nt|ritong: when he had some " normal" weak 2 |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c3|nt|bjacobs: And maybe they are quite right in their strategy|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
mc|9|nt|vugraphzpt: Had to ruff club for -2|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: so nice pickup there|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 11*23, one would think - 4@H being tres simple|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Based on the last hand surely this is an opening bid|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|mb|2N|nt|bjacobs: And if not, it is certainly an overcall by South, which seems unsound to me, but it looks like I'm behind the times|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West has an obvious 2NT :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Specs asking what it all means.  DON"T ASK ME, I'm just the commentator|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: So bridge started at 10:30am this morning and will finish at 9:30pm this evening with just one 45 minute break|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Spadesare ours says Fred|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzpt: In response to lead|pg||
mc|11|nt|ritong: makes 5, next  seems|pg||
nt|ritong: is|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Maybe an early finish and a break for  the VG op|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I got lots of explanations from the specs about E/W's bids, but since they are all different, I'm not going to relay them |pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: 2 more hours 3 more rounds|pg||
nt|ritong: saving time is important|pg||
nt|ritong: when you don t want to get in zeitnot on an important board|pg||

nt|bjacobs: 4NT perhaps?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Yes and he is deep in thought|pg||
nt|ritong: but it looks non fitting|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What advice can we give Fred?|pg||
nt|mslair: at least 4n.t:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, then 5NT :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: The maximum per board is 17 imps x 23 comparisons for the winners but the full loss for the losers I believe|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|6N|nt|bjacobs: He's gone the "choice of slams" route|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpt: 11 top tricks cant see a 12th without an endplay somewhere|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: A diamond lead would of course be fatal but unlikely|pg||
nt|ritong: east can be pressed on, but much easier with open hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Easy @CJ will put paid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: ood weapon|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sorry|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzpt: I see four spades 3 hearts three diamonds and one club after losing a spade and setting up that suit|pg||
nt|ritong: brad did well to save time, that one could be slow|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Sorry i should perhaps not have used the word top|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|ritong: hm|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Heart jack dropping in three and diamond jack dropping as well for last chance|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Gotta be the right play.  Cannot let the lead divert you from what is your only genuine chance|pg||
nt|ritong: not sunk yet, still possibilities to make 12 |pg||
nt|ritong: but not today|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: They fundamentally wrong sided the hand - likely make played by North|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Sorry posisbly make certainly better chances|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzpt: Next up Cheek and Grue agains Fred/Brad|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|ritong: @hs have to drop|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ritong: then, either good news in @ds or some squeeze|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, but doesn't get to first base|pg||
