nt|petergill: Darren Wolpert is a Canadian Open International in his late twenties. |pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|lc: Darren was the more-known one at firs, but his brother has eclipsed him in achievments lately.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: A false-preference and a 4-2 fit.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
nt|petergill: Dan Korbel played for the Canadian Youth Team until he turned 26 recently, and captained (non-playing, of course) the Canadian Seniors in Shanghai in 2007.  |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|s6|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lc: There are some who think a "weak NT" hand such as East's should rebid 1NT even without @H stopped, but that seems extreme with such good @C.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|lc: Surely, 1nT would have been a more sensible contract.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|dT|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lc: The weak notrumpers out there are all laughing.  They would have avoided this mess.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|d4|nt|lc: Surely, Wolpert didn't expect his partner could be 4-4.|pg||
nt|petergill: Your 1NT point is almost like a total trick concept - to go up a level beyond 1NT, not having enough trumps makes the decision risky. |pg||
nt|lc: Sort of.|pg||
nt|lc: All the X of 1@H really says is "4@S."|pg||
nt|lc: So, you tend to rebid as if it went 1@D-Pass-1@S-Pass.|pg||
nt|lc: On that auction (which was sort of this auction), you would routinely rebid 1NT with East's hand.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lc: So, many theorists, say to always rebid 1NT with a weak NT -- in comp -- even stoperless.|pg||
nt|lc: Of course, that can lead to other problems. For example, if responder has 14 and no stopper, he would need to check to make sure there is a stopper before bidding 3NT.|pg||
nt|petergill: Scores until the start of today are at http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/ then Session Information. No scores available for this session until after the session. |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lc: But, if the final contact is 1NT and the suit is unstopped, no big deal.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lc: So they take the first 5 tricks.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lc: Meanwhile, you avoid 4-3 (or worse, 4-2) fits in a minor.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|dK|mc|6|pg||
qx|o23|st||md|1SQJ72HKJ84DKQT8C4,SAKT9843HD9652CT2,SH7532DA743CAQJ83,S65HAQT96DJCK9765|sv|b|nt|lc: E-W were in 35th place,   N-S in 8th.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lc: 1@D  3@S  X   ??|pg||
nt|petergill: And East had some nice "low card" losers to throw on the 4th and 5th hearts, so 1NT rebid makes sense to me|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|nt|lc: Neg X is normal, just hoping partner doesn't leave it in.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: But, 4@H I think.|pg||
nt|petergill: The heart break is heart breaking for NS|pg||
nt|lc: And then will East X, or leave well enough alone?  |pg||
nt|lc: Pretty bad, but I don't see that 4@H is quite down yet...|pg||
nt|lc: Probably will meet a slow death, though.|pg||
nt|lc: Meanwhile, South could be considering PASSING.|pg||
nt|lc: Or maybe 3NT?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lc: The neg x at a high level does not guarantee 4@H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: At the start of today, Steve Weinstein and Bobby Levin led by about 800 imps (or about 40 real IMPs) from Connie Goldberg and Billy Eisenberg.|pg||
nt|lc: Marty Bergen calls these doubles "thrump X's" -- just hoping pard can bid 3NT.|pg||
nt|lc: North happens to have 4@H this time.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: I think East will leave well enough alone.|pg||
nt|petergill: Connie and Billy joined the field at the last minute to make it an even number of pairs. |pg||
nt|lc: Who wants to chase them to 5@D?|pg||
nt|lc: On the other hand, the younger you are, the more often you X.|pg||
nt|lc: I'd be content.|pg||
nt|lc: South could conceivably run to 4NT if X', but I doubt it.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Can NS make 4NT? They cannot make 4@HX. |pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|petergill: 5@D is hopeless. |pg||
nt|lc: I don't blame him (for the XX).|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Well, this rates to go very slowly.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: This could cause a late play on 24. :)|pg||
nt|petergill: -1 I expect|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lc: Let's click GIB.|pg||
nt|lc: This is too tough for human brains to analyze.|pg||
nt|lc: GIB says it makes now.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s5|nt|petergill: Maybe it has some chance to make, after that lead. |pg||
nt|lc: But, GIB can see all 52 cards, of course.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|lc: Looks like the normal lead, I must say.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lc: East will put in the 9, I suppose.|pg||
nt|petergill: DecLarer can proBably play fairly close to double dummy after the Dbl.|pg||
nt|lc: Notice that nobody thought of running (E-W) to 4@S.  It is macho to sit -- not run when you get XX.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|po-s: I suppose - not asking any software, just looking at East´s cards, that he can get 3 trump tricks and will have to give declarer two clubs|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lc: That feels like a relinquishing of control by East -- not that it is clear anything else is better.|pg||
nt|petergill: So Michel might make 4@HXX, with many many IMPs at stake. |pg||
nt|lc: many many|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, usually you try to retain the major tenace, keeping @HA until later, hence Larry's recommended play of @H9|pg||
nt|lc: So, would you rather be +1080, or -400?  I'd say that is a bit of a swing.|pg||
nt|po-s: given a choice?|pg||
nt|lc: You'd think dec is going to make a @S play now -- the Q or a low one is the issue.|pg||
nt|lc: Like Peter said, it is mostly double-dummy now.  I expect "Dad" to make it.|pg||
nt|petergill: Two ruffing finesses in black suits might relinquish control, so @SJ then diamonds perhaps?|pg||
nt|lc: He can play @SQ -- and if covered, ruff it.  Then just play red suits at will.|pg||
nt|lc: Yes.  Seems clear to play @S now, then @DK, then clear @H -- nothing East can do.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|petergill: Does GIB think a diamond or club lead at Trick 1 beats 4@HXX?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|lc: Too late to try now.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|po-s: doesn´t he need to play AQ oc clubs as well?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|petergill: When @DJ drops, declarer is delighted|pg||
nt|lc: He Can't just play @HK and then @D?|pg||
nt|petergill: ref webcam http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/webcam/1/table1.jpg|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|c3|nt|lc: East will have to play @C at all points.|pg||
nt|po-s: I think everything works|pg||
nt|lc: Besides, why get involved with @CK (just in case West, admitedly unlikely, has it).|pg||
nt|petergill: Alas the webcam is showing Darren Wolpert on the left and Thomas Bessis on the right|pg||
nt|lc: They look to be in pain.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: A magnifique score for pere Michel Bessis and his son Thomas - coming soon|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|lc: It is not fun to go -1080.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lc: South knows everything now -- can't go wrong.|pg||

nt|lc: 1080 sounds more like an A.M. radio station than a bridge score.|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: 2 minutes left|pg||
nt|lc: No surprise there.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|lc: "But director, there was a XX contract..."|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|3H|nt|lc: Maybe fit-showing?|pg||
nt|lc: @D + @C|pg||
nt|petergill: So the defence's error seems to have been the lead of a top spade at Trick 1 - you can decide if that was unlucky or not. |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|lc: Chance for 4@H XX again, but I think East will go to 5-minor|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: This is not going to help them finish in 2 minutes.|pg||
nt|petergill: I think with those @d's he will lead his trump|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lc: This looks like a slow, sweaty deal.|pg||
nt|petergill: Me wrong - again. |pg||
pc|c2|pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|lc: Although, I am told it is "freezing" in the room, so maybe not too sweaty.|pg||
nt|lc: This is not the kind of hand you want to play with the clock expired and the director hovering.|pg||
nt|petergill: Wih @S10 dropping, I can count 11 easy tricks for declarer after that lead. |pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Director here, N called saying most of the ttime the EW pair was slow|pg||
nt|petergill: No XX this time. |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|lc: We see the @S10 dropping, of course -- but declarer is in a quandry.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lc: What can be worse than -1080?   -1080 and a slow-play penalty.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|lc: This still looks complicated to me.|pg||
nt|petergill: Entries to the West hand are in short supply now|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|lc: Our buddy GIB can make it by peaking.|pg||
nt|petergill: Best to duck|pg||
nt|lc: peeking.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h3|pc|cQ|pc|c9|pg||
nt|lc: 2-2 trumps would have made life so much easier.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lc: That is surely fatal.|pg||
mc|10|nt|lc: Painful for E-W.|pg||
nt|petergill: duck @SA and overtake to pitch spade on @HK = only GIB can do that|pg||
nt|lc: Yes, we see he COULD have made it.  But...|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Ok ill be back very fast|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: closing table get ready|pg||
