mb|1H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: crape|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This will die in 2 or 3@D|pg||
nt|brolucius: I had to be careful with my typing.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Maybe 2@S, but not in France and Poland|pg||
nt|brolucius: A chance for West to perform the 'French offence'.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|po-s: yoy is fun for you...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|po-s: 3D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: plus good!|pg||
pc|d7|nt|po-s: guess not - it might be a 3card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Plusschreiben und gewinnen, as the Germans say|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jbgood: Fredin didnt have any hopes for a beer on the @d 7|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, it's easy enough to write plus scores down in your card, less easy to achieve them all the time.|pg||
nt|po-s: I don´t quite agree with trump lead - my hearts aren´t that good|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was hoping for some excitement on this round and this 2@D contract is exactly what we needed... (yawn). |pg||
pc|d3|nt|jbgood: but your heart is ticking?|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|brolucius: It is ticking at a very safe speed.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|jbgood: Fredin looking for another diamond|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|dJ|pc|hT|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|brolucius: The auction where responder has given preference to the second suit is one of the few auctions mentioned in text-books where a trump lead is a good idea. (Because responder is ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: often 1-3 in the opener's two suits and you can prevent ruffs.)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|d8|nt|brolucius: Needless to say, these text-books do not include as a good reason to lead trumps: '(4) When in doubt.'. |pg||
nt|jbgood: David's last book on 6 NT contracts is a treat people - he has surely not gotten any material so far tonite for a follow-up..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is about to write one on 1NT contracts|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
nt|jbgood: will take him 4 years to finish - writing at the same speed as the players in that contract|pg||
nt|po-s: It´ll take some time surely - if he is gonna do 5NT.4NT etc first|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|jbgood: if he goes down the line - 61s is the next title |pg||
pc|s4|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|jbgood: @s|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c9|nt|po-s: But perhaps they  can´t ever be played, just bid; grand slam force, Blackwood etc|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|brolucius: If that one does OK, I may try either 6@S or 3NT for the next one.|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: As if we did not have enough of 20/20 deals|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|po-s: 1H or D?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brolucius: Whichever Bridge World reporter has been assigned to write a report on this event will surely draw his material from the first two days.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: "Never pass with an ace", some experts say. Richie Reisig is one of those|pg||
nt|henryb: 1N or X?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2N|nt|reisig: YES, Roland :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Oh, hi Sir R :)|pg||
nt|henryb: trying to suggest long clubs|pg||
nt|jbgood: leb?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|reisig: hi hi :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Is the meaning of 2NT clear? Might he not have had a hand with hearts? I realise that East can rule this out because of his own hearts, as it happens.|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, sorry, I am half asleep. The heart overcall was not in second seat.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|henryb: no. he would not be bidding 2N to play after passing 1@d|pg||
nt|jbgood: I think it was intended either as pick a minor, or transfer to @c|pg||
nt|po-s: and probably the opponents|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|brolucius: I was lured into a semi-coma by the nature of the boards. I must apologise...|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: Club length with diamond tolerance perhaps. That's what he's got|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|jbgood: Fallenius didnt have a @d 7 to lead - so he went for prd's suit|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|d7|pc|h6|pg||
pc|sT|nt|po-s: I´m positive it was a choice between C and D. With only clubs he would bid them - or rather wouldn´t|pg||

nt|jbgood: nice that you are positive PO!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, choice between the minors. It was obvious to anyone who is fully awake.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Blimey, now a 21-19|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|po-s: and not only beacause we could see what he had..|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|po-s: For Austrians: because|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2S|mb|2N|nt|brolucius: 2@S is much better than a spurious double of 1NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Is this what they call the good/bad 2NT?|pg||
nt|henryb: why would you double 1N opposite a passed hand partner?|pg||
nt|jbgood: 8 in NT - 10 in @c|pg||
nt|brolucius: I once bid 2NT on that assumption and Marc Smith told me that it did not apply to this sequence. I never found out if he was right.|pg||
nt|po-s: this 2NT might be natural, or?|pg||
nt|henryb: I think its another example of both minors with a distinct preference for one of them|pg||
nt|jbgood: y - but implying minors|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|jbgood: I gather|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: I´m positive it shows 64|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: without looking|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: The Good-Bad 2NT rebid by the opener means that a rebid such as 3@D or 3@C would be strong (full value). With a weaker hand, still with good shape, you would travel via 2NT. ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Whether this applies opposite a 1NT response is to be discussed.|pg||
nt|jbgood: you are just being nominated for the "most positive commentary award" PO!|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/GoodBad2NTCohen.html   ask Larry Cohen; he is commentating next door|pg||
pc|cT|pc|dT|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|brolucius: So, 2NT could be (a) natural, (b) Good-Bad or, even... (c) Sunderlin 6-4 shape. |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s2|pc|h2|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: Sunderland if you please|pg||
nt|brolucius: Should be Sundelin...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's how he was introduced the other day|pg||
pc|s5|nt|reisig: A bad spelling contest?|pg||
mc|10|nt|brolucius: Yes, I mentioned to the announcer that Sunderland was not entirely right, but no change was made.|pg||
nt|jbgood: I wonder what happened to the superlative - good - bad - worst|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: 2nnt was keep talking, i dont have a good bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: closing and reopening soon|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It does apply after a 1NT response according to Larry Cohen|pg||
