nt|petergill: Same here, I have gone minus 4000, but never +1320|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: likely to slow n/s down a bit...|pg||
nt|viren169: or will it?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1N|nt|roswolf: a more mundane hand here|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes looks a "tilt" opening to me|pg||
nt|petergill: Big test for NS to maintain their composure, concentrate hard, say "this next hand, focus" to themselves, forget what just happened|pg||
nt|viren169: here comes the exitement...|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|viren169: ...c...|pg||
nt|petergill: 3rd seat not vul - 1@D is normal in 3rd seat. |pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm e/w now in another judgment situation|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 6@C looks good|pg||
nt|viren169: E is off to the races...|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 3NT is a lucky make as long as declarer picks the clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but the moysian fit looks ok too|pg||
nt|petergill: but East thinks West has four @H's for the 2@H bid|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H looks Ok, should make I think, but the play could be complex|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|viren169: may elect to run the T of @c|pg||
nt|viren169: not any more...|pg||
nt|cicus: she won't |pg||
nt|petergill: West might have made a less imaginative 3@C response to the take-out dbl of 2@D|pg||
nt|petergill: North had a very tough lead|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petergill: Leading @D's into the 1NT overcaller looked impossible|pg||
nt|roswolf: these girls frighten me - they certainly race in the fast lane|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|roswolf: mama-papa bridge is at least good for the nerves|pg||
nt|cicus: should play a spade now|pg||
nt|petergill: They are very good - and the pair already selected to join the winner of this match as the 2009 Polish Girls Team are in my opinion even better|pg||
nt|roswolf: of course|pg||
nt|petergill: That is Nataiia Sakowska who has impressed me in the past on BBO Vugraph, and Ewa Grabowska. |pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer probably worried about trumps breaking 4-2|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|roswolf: well she is right to be worried but hope should spring eternal|pg||
nt|petergill: In 4-3 fits, you usually remove the opponents' aces (ot kings) in your long suits first, due to your lack of trumps. Drawing trumps can wait. |pg||

pc|s3|nt|cicus: but all lines win|pg||
nt|roswolf: no but it works - the saving grace|pg||
nt|petergill: if clubs were about to be ruffed, it might be a good line|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: on Bd 3 I mean |pg||
nt|roswolf: dont see why east has to raise here like what happened in the other room|pg||
pc|h8|nt|petergill: Polish Club, hence no 3@D raise by East, which would happen in Standard American |pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|viren169: not sure about Polish @C... Could 2@D be a 3 card suit? ie 5332 shape?|pg||
nt|petergill: Since 1@d is limited, with a good hand West can jump to 3@D, allowing East to pass 2@D here. This limiting of strength of bids is one of the strength's of the Polish Club system|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|petergill: 2@D = up to about 14 hcp. It;'s over 10 years since I personally played Polish Club, so some of my comments might not be 100% accurate. |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|petergill: and my apostrophes might be misplaced too|pg||

nt|petergill: with 5@D it's up to 14 HCP, with 4 @D, up to perhaps 16 or 17, depends on each pair's exact style|pg||

nt|viren169: seems to have fallen on her feet...|pg||
pc|d7|nt|petergill: Being old, I have developed a healthy respect for vulnerability, and would not dream of opening South's hand at the adverse vulnerability. Being young, Kamila knows no fear. |pg||
nt|petergill: Gabor, are you almost as old as me? |pg||
nt|roswolf: that is why the red card should be used liberally|pg||
nt|cicus: I am much older, I'm afraid|pg||

nt|petergill: Polish card play tends to be of a very high standard|pg||
nt|cicus: are we stuck?|pg||

nt|petergill: 1@D playing Polish Club|pg||
pc|d5|nt|petergill: 2@C = at least 9 cards in minors, either suit could be longer|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes one of the systems weak areas i believe|pg||
nt|petergill: West might have bid 2@H to avoid playing in the 4-2 fit. |pg||
nt|cicus: I agree with that, Peter, 2@H can't be worse than 2@D|pg||
nt|petergill: In Poland , 1@D - 1@H - 2@H guarantees four @H's 100% for sure|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|petergill: In America, if you open 1@d on the West cards, West rebids 2@H, not 2@C, when partner shows 4 hearts via the Dbl of 1@S. |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|petergill: The Poles say that their bidding style is better, the Americans are convinced that their bidding style is better. Me, well, I don't know. |pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|roswolf: this is trappy for e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: e/w need to stay low - 3nt?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|petergill: Very Polish to open 1@S not 1@H with 5-6. Me, well I open 1@H, with my American influences. |pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|petergill: 2NT forcing|pg||
nt|viren169: Hi all|pg||
nt|petergill: Holeska will bid 3@S now, I think|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is where the wheels may start to fall off|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Good afternoon to Gad Chadha|pg||
nt|cicus: now E might refrain from 3NT because of her weak @C stopper|pg||
nt|petergill: Bad breaks await EW|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Gad. |pg||
nt|roswolf: both 4@C or 4@D are fraught with danger|pg||
nt|cicus: I'd bid 4@D|pg||
nt|petergill: Misfits = stay low|pg||
mb|4D|nt|cicus: but west could have 2 @Ds and 1@C and even a grand migzt be there|pg||
mb|d|nt|petergill: I'd bid 3@S, in case partner is 6-5, then pass if partner rebids 3NT over 3@S. |pg||
nt|roswolf: south must resist doubling until game reached|pg||
nt|viren169: 3N anyone?!?!|pg||
mb|r|nt|viren169: here comes the rain!|pg||
nt|petergill: Partner's failure to bid 3@D over 2NT, which she might do with a doubleton or trebleton @D, puts me off the minor suit  a bit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: also, peeking at South's @D put me off the 4@D bid, but at the table I wouldn't be able to peek of course|pg||
nt|cicus: she should bid her 5th @H before correcting with a doubleton, I think|pg||
pc|s9|nt|viren169: I think the dble has come in too early...|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm someones blood will flow here|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@DXX will be very interesting - might even make|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cicus: isn't there an overtrick?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|petergill: I don't much like South's Dbl - it seems a bit impatient. Polish players like to Dbl. |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|h2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|viren169: brave redble all the same!|pg||
nt|cicus: only 2 @Ds to lose, it seems|pg||
nt|petergill: Club switch needed to limit the entires to dummy. |pg||
nt|roswolf: but may well bring in a bushel of imps|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|cicus: 1020?|pg||
nt|petergill: Low form doubleton is the Polish method |pg||
nt|viren169: North wont be too happy with the outcome!|pg||
nt|petergill: @SA is best now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: needs to unblock the spades but is a safe 10 tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: well played|pg||
nt|roswolf: and well redoubled|pg||
nt|viren169: Dummy is looking a bit good now!|pg||
nt|cicus: XX might have been a cuebid...|pg||
nt|viren169: Not convinced that redble was to play....|pg||
nt|roswolf: anyway.............|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will be depressed|pg||
nt|petergill: Izabella Weinhold will be waiting anxiously, not knowing the trump position, but soon will think this is a bella result|pg||
nt|cicus: I guess west took 4@D as a cuebid for hearts|pg||
nt|cicus: and was shocked to see it passed out|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|viren169: will be pretty happy soon...|pg||
nt|cicus: she'll recover soon|pg||
nt|petergill: If ruffed, club to king, @HA, then @SK so South just wins her three trump tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: so South tries this tack, whcih might allow an overtrick|pg||
pc|d8|nt|roswolf: i accept west redouble was a cue but it showed her suitability and east wisely passed - the partnership was in harmony|pg||
nt|petergill: !8 - well played|pg||
