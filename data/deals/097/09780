mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|jbgood: y - and he is the master of 11 1/2 languages|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: 1@C  11-13 or 17-19 balanced, or natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|henryb: 9 top tricks in 3N despite suits not breaking and finesses offside|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Is the half-language English?|pg||
nt|jbgood: not sure - Crickish is one he masters beautifully|pg||
nt|henryb: probably Hungarian|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brolucius: East is about to discover that North has a spade stopper...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jbgood: only one way to play clubs - coffee?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tea please|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jbgood: coming by expresso mail:)|pg||
nt|henryb: coke if you would|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|brolucius: Swap the 8 and 7 of clubs and West is meant to false-card the 9 to offer an alternative play.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|c6|nt|brolucius: Declarer then has to guess which high club to play on the second round.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jbgood: either tea, coffee or red wine Henry..|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: I would not buy that when East has length in spades, but it would have been worth a try|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d6|pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|henryb: as long as your up I'll have a Grant's|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, you are right. West would be unlikely to have two black singletons.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jbgood: from the fridge..|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|brolucius: Very few IMPs can be changing hands on the boards that we have seen, which is exactly what those who are well placed want.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|jbgood: for David - i hope so|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: I don;t want to get a reputation as a grumpy old man (just because I am a grumpy old man).|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|jbgood: nice to stay low - but boring..|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: Save your money for something useful, Cata|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|jbgood: sounded as no undo was needed:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: I was saying because the boards where not that exciting :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hard to see how Levin-Weinstein can squander their huge lead with these boards. In fact, they can't|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jbgood: impossible|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/2009/PAIRS5O.htm  for standings after session 4 of 5. There will be no running scores during the last session|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: "Things must happen", Welland said to himself|pg||
pc|d5|nt|henryb: and perhaps not a lucky contract. It seems to have 4 losers|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|henryb: or even 5|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, once the 1NT overcall comes, placing the @HA, and probably both club honours, the game becomes less good.  I expect they would have bid it if West bid something else instead ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: of 1NT.|pg||
nt|jbgood: and if he tries for more - there will be 5 or 6 losers|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s6|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|brolucius: Normally, when you have this diamond holding and fear a ruff, you win with the honour that will leave the other honour protected from a ruff. But here East can take two diamond ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: ruffs.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 for lowest suit - clubs|pg||
nt|jbgood: some call it suit pref - some lav - some dont know about it..|pg||
nt|brolucius: West played an unorthodox queen at Trick 1, to encourage partner to ruff immediately.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|jbgood: and as a kib points out: some see suit pref/lav in every card played..|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|s4|pc|dK|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S was a bit too much on the North cards, but it is hard to see how else he could have bid the hand. I dare say that 3@S should be read as a serious bid when vulnerable against ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: not.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jbgood: how many clubs can EW make? |pg||
