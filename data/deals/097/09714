nt|brolucius: We have been watching the Norwegians much of the time. It would not surprise me to hear that they are among the losers, particularly after that 6@D slam the bid...|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|brolucius: Michel (father) is West and Thomas (son) East.  Thomas won a prize to play with Zia in the Lederer in London and they were in the winning team (with von Arnim and Auken)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Being French, I need not tell you that West has promised FOUR-card support for his raise to 2@H.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|po-s: you are French???|pg||
nt|brolucius: Helness could not speak on the first round, with length in the opened suit, but he doubles for take-out on the next round.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Moi?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|brolucius: It seems that they must play 2NT Lebensohl responding to this double and that 3@D therefore showed values.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|brolucius: Fine effort by N-S in the bidding. It was not easy.|pg||
nt|po-s: donÂ´t think it can be beaten|pg||
nt|mslair: I think it can make 6 p.o.:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Helgemo-Helness were encourage by their previous venture to 6@D (which made, despite being about 15%) to 'double or quit' on this deal.|pg||
nt|po-s: I was told to be careful|pg||
nt|brolucius: What am I talking about. They are in 5@D, of course.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Declarer may misguess in clubs, with Helgemo marked with the high cards.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|brolucius: When players switch through a K-J, they normally have the ace. That's because they cannot be sure that it is safe when holding the queen (declarer may have A-10).|pg||

nt|brolucius: The table has to be closed after each three-board set to set new player names. Some people have been asking about that.|pg||
