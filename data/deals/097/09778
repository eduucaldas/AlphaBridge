mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: OK -- i've stalled long enough so that we now have bridge.|pg||
nt|bobh1: left out a couple of passes?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|bobh1: unfortunately not an exciting hand|pg||
nt|lc: Yes, it will make more sense now.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lc: But, it doesn't look like brigde.|pg||
nt|lc: Must be a typo|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|lc: So, Pepsi has made a neg X for 3 straight deals.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: As I keep saying I am a male and can't multi-task|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lc: And on 2 of them they have reached a 4-3 fit.|pg||

pc|h2|nt|lc: If you want me to discuss the play in 1@S, you have the wrong commentator.|pg||
nt|lc: Hey, Kit -- are you out there watching?  Jump in for this one.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Sony Moyse around|pg||
pc|h5|nt|poohbear: I have a question Larry|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||
nt|lc: 1@S contracts are for story-telling, Good.|pg||
nt|lc: Go ahead Barry.|pg||
nt|bobh1: even the players are barely paying attention|pg||
nt|poohbear: You say you wont play in this event cause it is too random|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lc: yes,...|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|poohbear: But every year the same pairs are always in contention|pg||
nt|poohbear: so is it really random?|pg||
nt|lc: Yes, it has been that way recently.  And I am surprised.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Good question Barry|pg||
nt|lc: I always ask Stevie (Weinstein) -- how do you do it?|pg||
nt|lc: He swears that the luck evens out over 3 days.|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think larry's point may be that there are usually a few good pairs totally out of contention|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|bobh1: because you can certainly have enough bad luck to have no chance|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|lc: But, if you look at say Brogeland-Svendsen, Bertheau-Nystrom ...|pg||
nt|cavendish: ah yes, but in every sport there are always blind pigs and acorns|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lc: I am sure they are not having a nice time this week.|pg||
nt|bobh1: but the players who do well are invariably good players|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|d8|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pc|h6|nt|lc: Too many times I showed up, paid $15,000 or so (including betting) and was dealt out of contention.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|lc: Yes, some years I did well...|pg||
mc|8|nt|lc: Maybe over 20 years I had a small profit.|pg||

nt|lc: But, the joy of winning didn't make up for the unlucky years.|pg||
nt|lc: But, good question Barry.  Very few of my peers feel the way I do -- so thankfully we have this event to watch!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Some players who may not be up to this class are attracted by the "play with.against Tiger Woods" approach so there are some non-contenders but not many|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|an|10-15 Minors|nt|poohbear: I like your commentating !!! and appreciate it every year!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Yes dont play Larry or we would lose you as a comm|pg||
nt|lc: Thanks.  So that will be my party line.  I enjoy commentating more than playing :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpt: Done deal|pg||
nt|lc: Speaking of which, there is a new deal and not in 1@S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: not your grandmother's 2@c bid here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Would not have been allowed in her day|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: this is a common Swedish treatment|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bobh1: no would have been allowed in her day; would not be allowed in our day :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Pepsi probably had an easy 2NT |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Pepsi has been massaging a trump a few times now|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|sK|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lc: You can massage a trump?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|bobh1: if he had just bid 2n he wouldn't have to worry about massaging trumps|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|hT|pg||
nt|lc: Well, in Vegas, they allow anything.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|lc: So far, this set of boards is not going to increase the ratings for this program.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Caressing the @HJ Pepsi is|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lc: It is a shame that more people don't watch bridge.  Too bad we can't catch the same following as Poker has.  TV and all.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|c5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bobh1: if we had more money events we would be more popular|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: They have made a silk puse out of a sows ear with this defence|pg||
nt|bobh1: no one wants to watch people battling for masterpoints|pg||
nt|lc: But, then again, the general public can't follow/understand.  They know that 2 Queens beats 2 Jacks.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|s8|pg||
nt|poohbear: Speaking of Poker , Martin DeKnijff won the 25000 buyin at the Bellagio a few years back|pg||
nt|lc: Steve Weinstein (event leader) won $660,000 in a poker tournament last month.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lc: At least, that was the 1st place prize. |pg||
nt|poohbear: He is one of the most feared poker players in the world. There has been a crossover lately in both directions|pg||

mb|1H|mb|2C|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d7|nt|bobh1: the 2@c bid put a damper on south's ambitions|pg||
nt|lc: In the Support X era, the raise to 2@H shows 4-card support.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Next here will be Cheek/Grue who are battling  for some prize money left on the table by Levin/Weinstein|pg||
nt|poohbear: wake me up when the good boards come please:)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|lc: This had to be the dullest round of the event so far.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Must be I havent said much|pg||
nt|bobh1: staying low might be worth something on this board--if W doesn't get involved NS might get too high|pg||
nt|bobh1: and even run into a double|pg||
nt|lc: It does illustrate the difference between IMPs and matchpoints.  At matchpoints, all of these "little" deals are of equal importance.|pg||

nt|poohbear: the problem with MPs in this event is: It would take forever!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I dont know 4 down in 2@C on the previous hand was impressive|pg||
nt|lc: If you were on the wrong side of Board 1 today (Grand slam on a guess), you would need many of these boards  10-11-12 to go your way to make up for it.|pg||

nt|vugraphzpt: Closing and reopening|pg||
