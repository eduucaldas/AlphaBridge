mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|lc: So, we'd expect this to be a partscore deal around all 24 tables.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Guido Ferraro doesn't quite make Italy's top three pairs but is often in Lavazza teams whenever one of the top six is unavailable|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lc: Personally, I'd pass with the North hand.  If I bid 1NT, my partner would normally jumpshift.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lc: Surely, 1NT can work out well (get to a better spot, or steal from the opponents).|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|lc: Normally, this auction screams for a trump lead, but not from @CAQ doubleton.|pg||

nt|petergill: 200 to EW looks likely|pg||

mb|1H|nt|petergill: A heart continuation, instead of teh spade, might have beaten it by 300. |pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: @H game for E-W on the @D finesse or better if no @D lead.|pg||
mb|3C|an|4!hs|nt|lc: if no @S lead, I mean.|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C = some sort of heart raise. |pg||
mb|3S|nt|petergill: Not a Bergen Raise, but the Italian variation thereof. |pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|lc: Of course, the @D finesse is on, but the @H are so poor that 4@H was doomed on @D lead.|pg||
nt|lc: @S lead.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: So, another phantom save -- our second of the day.|pg||
nt|petergill: Looks like 300|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lc: Still, I can see North bidding 4@S -- maybe expecting it to make.  |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|lc: There are conflicting ideas for North :|pg||
nt|lc: 1) "Always bid 4@S over 4@H"|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lc: But, |pg||
pc|h5|pc|s3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lc: 2) Not really enough trumps around to make it likely to work (LOTT).|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|petergill: and if dummy had a @h higher than the ten, it would not be a phantom. |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lc: I think I would have bid 4@S (showing my honesty--since I see it is wrong this time) :)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|petergill: Total Tricks = 9 + 9 trumps - but @HA is opposite a void and North knows it. North had a close decision, didn't he? |pg||
nt|lc: Yes, I think it is close when just considering LOTT. That @H10 is a big issue -- especially when it is a trick on def not off - as happened here.|pg||
mc|8|nt|lc: Like Peter said, if a @H honor was in dummy, 4@H would have made.|pg||
nt|petergill: If North had @HA109x in hearts, that would swing the odds to defending, wouldn't it?|pg||

mb|p|nt|lc: Normal 3NT here.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lc: Again, I'll predict all 24 tables in 3NT.  How stupid I'm trying to look today.|pg||
nt|petergill: A major suit take-out by South, I expect|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Majors, I'd suppose.  Now West needs methods.|pg||
nt|lc: over "Majors" I like to play the following:|pg||
nt|lc: 3NT = no stopper in either major|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lc: 2NT forces 3@C (lebensohl) then 3NT = stopper in BOTH majors|pg||
nt|lc: (Slow shows).|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|lc: Direct 3 MAJ = shortness|pg||
nt|lc: Slow 3 MAJ (via 2NT) shows stopper only in that MAJOR.|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 8: Eric Rodwell bid 4@S too at the other table on BBO, so Larry, you bid like Eric Rodwell - no disrespect intended to either of you. |pg||
nt|lc: So, with West, I'd have bid 2NT relay to 3@C, then 3@S to show @S stop.|pg||
nt|lc: I've had worst things said about me than "I bid like Rodwell."|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|petergill: Does the same scheme apply over 2@H DONT, Larry?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|lc: Yes -- over any bid showing majors, you can "do it all."|pg||

nt|petergill: Cute @SJ, not covered. |pg||

pc|d6|pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|petergill: I think running @SJ would not have risked the contract, but South did play low on it very smoothly indeed, like a man with no @SQ.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
mc|10|nt|lc: But, declarer needed to set up @D if 4-2 -- so couldn't risk it (losing 1@S, 3@H and a @D).|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Ok will reopen soon with rd 23 closing now :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes|pg||
nt|lc: Now, at matchpoints, it would be a different consideration completely.|pg||
