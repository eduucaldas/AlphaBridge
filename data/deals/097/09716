nt|lc: In this event, players move from N-S to E-W -- |pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Welcome Back. Moss/Gitelman sat the wrong direction in R1 and bemoaning the 2NT going -4|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lc: Is that a joke, David?  Or, did they really sit the wrong way?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The German pair here are playing, I believe, a Polish Club system|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lc: If you do sit the wrong way, it is no big problem.  Just a minor techincal scoring adjustment needed.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s7|nt|lc: North's 3NT is the normal call.  You just close your eyes and overcall 3NT after a 3-level preempt  (with anything resembling a strong NT)|pg||
nt|lc: And your partner doesn't hang you.  He assumes you are playing him for something.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Nice to see respect and leading partner's suit with a singleton|pg||
nt|lc: So, will he play @CK, @CJ?  I think so, given the auction.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is 4 club tricks enough though?|pg||
nt|lc: Right, he expects the @HK onside, but might think he needs all 5 @C tricks.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: If you can set up a second spade trick 2-2-1-4 perhaps|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe he can duck a @S, and get a @S continuation to start.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: interesting hand|pg||
nt|lc: Yes.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose defense can always get red suits going in time.|pg||
nt|lc: Much easier now that declarer won the 1st trick.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: He cant afford @CK first though|pg||
nt|lc: So, maybe he will think he does need 5 @C tricks and play @CA and then another @C to get the awful news.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Fred may have to guess whether to play a heart or diamond|pg||
nt|lc: Of course, @CK, then @CJ works if West started with @C10x.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bjacobs: Or maybe play on hearts, using @HA to lead a club from dummy ... also picks up singleton queen with West|pg||
nt|lc: If he wanted to be in dummy with @HA, he should lead @HQ -- more likely to get covered than the @HJ.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Fred in tank|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: That duck may set up endplays later|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: @CJ best now|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|lc: That's a nice start, getting @C right.  But will it be enough?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: duck is best but wont give up 10x on right|pg||
nt|lc: He might win @CA -- hoping to pin @C10x.  Yes.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: No I think down|pg||
nt|lc: Ducking leaves better transportation -- but still -- I see only 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|lc: However, where there are 8....|pg||
nt|bjacobs: For me, where there are 8, there is sometimes 7, as I try for 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: If he wins this in dummy he has no quick entry to hand to play another towards nine|pg||
nt|lc: Like David said, there a potential to endplay East in the REDs, but I think Gitelman can always avoid that (maybe needing to unblock in @D in some variation).|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Fatal now methinks|pg||
nt|lc: Now, he will have to make a play that makes it much easier for the defense.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Everything now unfolds the hand for Fred/Brad|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lc: I suppose he'll play @S|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|vugraphzpt: Your suppositions are correct|pg||
nt|lc: Now Moss has to refrain from clearing @S.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Next up here Bates and Compton|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Then Zia/Wigoder|pg||
nt|lc: Several tables will certainly score 600 N-S, so I expect Gitelman-Moss to win at leat 100 cross-imps here (probably more).|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: @DK best to keep entry to west's hand|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Fred caressing the @HK which I dont understand|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lc: Takes out entry to @C.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Kills clubs|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s2|pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|lc: He didn't know who had the @H10|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d8|pc|c3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|ritong: aka merrimac move|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||
nt|ritong: hi larry and all|pg||
mc|8|nt|lc: So, any carefuly defense was all that was needed. But there will be some careless defenses!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Bonjour Henri|pg||

mb|1S|nt|bjacobs: Is that code?|pg||
mb|2S!|an|4!H Longer Minor|nt|lc: I suspect 4@S by N-S at most tables.|pg||
nt|lc: No code -- just think 1@C is possible.|pg||
nt|ritong: looks like a raptor variation|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4H|nt|ritong: i know fred hates 1NT overcall for this handtype|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps 1@C not available in their Polish Club style|pg||
nt|ritong: but he does not hate showing that handtype:)|pg||
nt|lc: Moss suspects the minor is @D, or he'd never stop bidding.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpt: Could steal the pot here|pg||
nt|lc: 3@H was no doubt a Limit+ ! raise (bidding opps known suit).|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Tough for Smirnov|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lc: I'd think North would surely bid 4@S after getting raised like that.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: not sure why|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Calls for some Vodka (his favorite drink?) and bids 4@S ...|pg||
nt|ritong: since smirnov has no precise idea about who makes what, he simply bids one more for the road|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I think north placed undue pressure on partner by passing perhaps|pg||
nt|lc: Is it possible Piekarek thought his Pass was forcing?   |pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: No alerts|pg||
nt|lc: Well, I don't think they would alert that.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Pass SHOULD be forcing, no?  After the 3@H cue|pg||
nt|lc: If he is thinking now, that implies he thought it was forcing. It wouldn't make sense to be willing to sell out to 4@H and then act again.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Not at the four level but he didnt look like it could have been if you know what I mean|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe Gitelman is thinking of saving?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: If 3@H is limit raise why should pass be forcing|pg||
nt|lc: It wouldn't be fore me.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: not in 5@D I hope and yes he has|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|d|mb|5H|nt|vugraphzpt: Saving at the five level in 4-4 fit LC wouldn't recommend that|pg||
nt|lc: The play in 5@HX looks complex -- |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpt: Three rounds of spades will start killing dummy|pg||
nt|lc: OK.  GIB says DOWN 3 on any lead.  Who would have thought.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: It hasnt happened yet|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bjacobs: The Law has them overboard by 2 tricks ... 16 total trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Do people lead 9 form KJ108 havent seen that one before|pg||
nt|lc: Bill, Are you trying to curry favor with me? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: KJ109|pg||
nt|ritong: he has a void, mind you|pg||
nt|ritong: and trumps|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|bjacobs: I am your biggest fan Larry, so, I guess ... yes|pg||
nt|lc: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Yes smart ones simple fourth best|pg||
nt|lc: It seems they return low from a doubleton (Polish style, I guess).|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|lc: North seems to want his @D ruff badly.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Diamond ruff and @HA is -3|pg||
nt|lc: So, is this a phantom?  I think 4@S would have gone slowly, but probably would make.|pg||
nt|ritong: a trick in @ds under any form will do|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North wants the ruff, and South knows, but with his diamond holding, he's not that keen|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: If The minor suit kings were swapped around a dimaond ruff may be imperative|pg||
nt|lc: Sure, down 3 at least.  Only question is if it is possible to beat it 4 if declarer does something wrong.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Unfortunately us poor humble operators arent blessed with GIB analysis so we have to do the work|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Results at end session 1 http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/2009/PAIRS1S.htm|pg||
nt|lc: Smirnov has little idea as to anyone's shape.  He has no clue that North started with 5=2=0=6.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: @SK only chance for declarer to go wrong |pg||
nt|lc: @SK now, and declarer might surely mess up and go down too many.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bjacobs: Tapping the dummy seems advised, surely|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|bjacobs: But no|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c6|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
mc|8|pg||
qx|o6|st||md|4SQ964HAQ8D75CT632,ST2HKJT75DAJCKJ75,S3H6432DQT9632CA9,SAKJ875H9DK84CQ84|sv|e|nt|lc: 4@S or 3NT for E-W it would seen.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: seem|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ritong: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: 1@S P 2@H P 2@S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzpt: 2 minutes grace|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|bjacobs: Sorry?  We need to pray for 2 minutes or something?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: This hand may be played quickly|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lc: Now, 2NT or 3@C?  I like 2N|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Yes, this is a fast one. |pg||
pc|dT|nt|lc: Overtricks are of little importance in this form of scoring.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Lets say some but not crucial importance|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, declarer MIGHT be a little nervous about his entries to the spades|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Particularly when @S10 holds, then North shows out ...|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lc: @S10 x x x |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose that could slow things down a little....|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|bjacobs: Now, that's nice planning|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ritong: much better now|pg||
nt|lc: Yes, that was a thoughtful play (the @C first).|pg||
nt|lc: If @S are coming in, they are always coming in later. So, a good declarer tries to survive even if @S are bad.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "Hope for the best, prepare for the worst"|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d2|nt|lc: I would guess a few E-W will carelessly go -100 on this one -- especially if time pressure (caused by Board 5 at most tables).|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bjacobs: And now Moss preens himself ... he's in complete control with that club play|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lc: Can you preen oneself?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: There must be a way|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Slick back the hair, or something|pg||
mc|11|nt|lc: I think it can mean to show satisfaction in yourself -- so yes. :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Closing and reopening|pg||
pg||
