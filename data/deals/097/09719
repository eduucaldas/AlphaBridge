nt|bjacobs: I have a partner like that ... dreamer ...|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lc: So, nothing sexy for Zia to do here other than watch his opps reach 4@S.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H!|nt|bjacobs: We can admire the 2NT?|pg||
nt|lc: Gitelman-Moss are more apt to open 1NT and 2NT than any other players in the game.|pg||
nt|lc: Most balanced hands seem to get upgraded to 1NT or 2NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Yes because they have a flexible approach to the bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|lc: Not that the East hand isn't worth it.  Still, it is a bit off-beat.|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose if you open 1@C, though, there is no good rebid -- so 2NT makes sense.|pg||
nt|ritong: fred did not want to face the probable rebid problem after 1@c|pg||
nt|mslair: down one vul save in 5 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: The door has been opened for the sac|pg||
nt|lc: X on this auction is L.D. only (lead directing).|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpt: I think Fred passed thinking it may be better played by Brad|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The door has been opened ... but I don't think anyone is going to walk through|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: East's Pass means something -- all good partnerships would discuss what Pass, XX, and 4@S mean.|pg||
nt|ritong: possibly a non @h control|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I like Pass as encouraging, 4@S as "shut up partner"|pg||
nt|lc: Usually, Pass is "positional" -- means you prefer to play from other side.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: He was thinking so I am doubting the pass was systemic because the one thing here is that these guys know their system|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I agree Larry|pg||
nt|ritong: redouble meaning first round and any bid ( here 4@s) second round control|pg||
nt|lc: With poor @H, and the expected @H lead, you want to be able to let partner play it in case he has a @H honor.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Brad looks a little bewildered|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: don t think playing the hand scares him|pg||
nt|lc: Nothing about Zia's hand and the VUL looks like a 5@H bid.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Maybe pass says I have a really good hand for  you|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lc: I never like it when I've made a Lead-Directing Double and end up on lead myself.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Moss may be thinking he has missed 6 on the bidding|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: he s consistent , however|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, not much in this one.  They actually played it from the right side for the overtrick, since from other side it could have gone @HK and @D shift to hold it to 4.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's actually rather awkward to play 4@S on that defence ... what do you do?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|nt|bjacobs: Win the diamond and play a low club from East I guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Moss looks quizzically at the @C10|pg||
nt|ritong: for those among you wondering who "mr bbo" is, you have two options|pg||
nt|lc: Moss can afford to have this lose to the @CK and have a @C ruffed if that is the position.|pg||
nt|ritong: either fred or gitelman|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||

nt|lc: A marginal 6NT here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Zia noting that he has his moment in the sun being on VuGraph - said he sat in the wrong seat with the webcam the other way|pg||
nt|lc: Certainly makable on the lie of the cards.  31 HCP and a 5-card suit.|pg||
nt|lc: With South opening, most of field rates to stumble into slam.|pg||
mb|2N|an|12-14 balanced|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|lc: No.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|lc: Really 2NT?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|lc: This would get him to 7NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I have checked the bidding cleaned my glasses stood up oin my seat and yes|pg||
nt|ritong: we might miss a pair of passes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Someone has gone mad|pg||
mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpt: All kosher|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Specs telling me they play the weak NT.  2NT = 12 0 14|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 12-14|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I am told: Earlier it was said that zia is playing 2n = balance 12-14 wiht widgoder|pg||
nt|lc: Surely that would be alerted. No?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Wigoder has just confirmed to me that 2NT is 12-14 balanced|pg||
nt|lc: I guess it is true, since North didn't bid 7.|pg||
nt|ritong: with a huge card|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now specs asking about their ONE notrump opening!  A fair question|pg||
nt|ritong: possibly 20/21|pg||
nt|lc: I thought I'd seen everything... I gues not.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Please see http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/2009/PAIRS1S.htm to check out how well this convention is working|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Wigoder syas that 1NT is 15-17|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: As he smiles to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I find it hard to smile back when considering this system|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose they feel they are underdogs, so try a method that will create swings.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lc: And this method surely will!|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: The time it took for the @H10 to be led may suggest hearts are 3-3|pg||
nt|lc: We can see how well the @S are sitting, but this is not clear how to play...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyone want to bet just how p.... off E/W will be if 6NT makes?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I wonder if 3NT is 9-11|pg||
nt|lc: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: when it makes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: when?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, I suppose it's a fair declarer|pg||
nt|lc: I don't think it is so obvious to make this. I know that looking at all 4 hands we can.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: 3-4-3-2 sounds like 12|pg||
nt|lc: How does declarer know to play for all the @S right?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's right, there are 3 black suit finesses, and two are working, and two are needed|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Cant really go wrong can he. Tests diamonds and then.....|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes? Please continue?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: 2-4-4-1 will be -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: OK I will back him to make it|pg||
nt|lc: Start @D and then what?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I will take 7/5|pg||
nt|ritong: there is an other thing|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe he even plays a @C at trick to to the J.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: That's $2.40 for our Aussie and UK friends|pg||
nt|ritong: say @h 10 really comes from a doubleton|pg||
nt|lc: Also, this @H10, I suspect is a falsecard -- yes.|pg||
nt|ritong: and a first @s hook fails|pg||
nt|ritong: then, east will surely play a @h back|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ritong: thinking his pard led from 109|pg||
nt|lc: So, @DQ now or a @C ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Next up  here Kurkowski and Lord against Gitelman Moss|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c5|nt|lc: It is not easy now to pass the @S9 into the good @D hand!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: club could be fatal for entries to double hook spades|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Regarding the lead ... Moss knows his partner is just about broke ... so there is little need to play honestly|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzpt: Gone now|pg||
nt|lc: Now, I think Gitelman has to win and play a @C -- because @H gives extra entry?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As it turns out, Fred has a VERY intersting play now|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But a club gives the club show away ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Black suit squeeze play if a  club comes back|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He wouldn't switch to a club holding the king, would he?|pg||
nt|lc: That @H discard gives dec extra entry to hand.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|lc: So, if he plays for both spades he can make it -- but will he?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|lc: No.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
mc|11|nt|lc: Tough hand.  Not sure Zia did anything wrong.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: closing and reopening|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think it was a top notch lead|pg||
nt|lc: One more deal, no?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Ah after this deal that is|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Zia must have thought he had only 3 heart tricks ... so the club finesse was a "sine qua non"|pg||
nt|lc: That will be 100's of cross-imps to E-W -- I'd guess about 220 or so -- now up 1,000 or so on the set, I'd think.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: They just delivered the hands to me so thought it was time|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|lc: I'm auditing -- yes -- and what do you owe me at 7/5 on the 6NT down?|pg||
nt|lc: Very normal to open Wk 2 on 5-card suit in 3rd at Fav.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|lc: I'd say that if available, 90% of experts would indeed open 2@D in this position.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Into the black hole marches  Zia|pg||
nt|lc: Remarkable balance by Zia.  Yikes!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: if he was thinking his opps had 9@D, so pard was short, that was naive...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bjacobs: More code from Larry ...|pg||
nt|lc: I'd bet on East to have only 5 in this seat, WHITE ---|pg||
nt|lc: With 6, he'd open 3@DF.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Nice considered lead in case something needs playing towards West|pg||
nt|lc: And West might have raised even with only 2.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lc: So, to expect short @D was really a strecth.|pg||
nt|lc: Still, he could have been right.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Zia Tittering to himsefl|pg||
nt|lc: I am looking at all4 hands.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: He got the shortage missed the suit|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't think that's right.  In this case, you don't have to look at all 4 hands to believe that 3@S is an anti-percentage gamble|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lc: Not so bad now!|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lc: If WEst isn't careful, this could make!|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h3|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Oh not so bad|pg||
nt|lc: Oh well.  If Zia had cashed his Black winners, Moss would have to throw @DA or be endplayed (easy, though).|pg||
pc|dT|pc|sT|nt|vugraphzpt: Lost 4 tricks so far|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|h8|pc|sK|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: -1|pg||
nt|lc: He can get out for -1 -- not bad!  (West endplayed when he ruffs last @C)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h2|pc|c7|nt|bjacobs: It's pretty bad when you consider that 3@D had no play whatsoever.  OK, not that many imps, but even so|pg||
mc|8|nt|vugraphzpt: Closing and reopening|pg||
