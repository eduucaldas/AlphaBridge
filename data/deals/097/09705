nt|vugraphzps: Hi!! WElcome back to Las vegas|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzps: Hi welcome to Las Vegas again|pg||
nt|Jacki: Were starting the tournament with the John Roberts Teams.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Jacki: This is an invitational event, with 16 teams competing; the entry fee is a modest $US 10,000 p|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb: we seem to be specializing in French teams in the early going|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jlrice: should be a fairly boring 4H here   will make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|Jacki: Awards for this and all the Cavendish events will be posted on the website as they become available.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|dburn: 2@c presumably showed diamonds, and 3NT was a good practical effort|pg||
mc|10|nt|Jacki: The scoring is IMPs, converted to Victory Points.|pg||
nt|Jacki: There will be three 9-board matches per session, two sessions today and one Thursday.|pg||
nt|Jacki: Thank you for joining us, and we hope you enjoy the events.|pg||
nt|dburn: aggressive sort of overcall, that|pg||

nt|dburn: same contract at the other table, so no swing - as one would expect at this level of play|pg||
nt|dburn: Weinstein chose 1@d and struggled unsuccessfully in 2@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: what can we learn from all of this?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jlrice: hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: very aggressive X here by joel|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C|mb|3D|nt|dburn: superficially North-South have only three losers in a spade contract, but that club blockage may be awkward|pg||
nt|dburn: and getting to spades at all may not be so easy now, although it would not be totally absurd for Bompis to bid them|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, at some other vulnerabilities he might barely have overcalled in them|pg||
nt|jlrice: quantin could easily have spades since he didnt preempt or open 1C    so probably had a reason not to|pg||
mb|3S|nt|dburn: that's not "aggressive" - that's downright rabid|pg||
nt|dburn: he did bid them|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: would a X of 3D have been penalty  |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlrice: yes   i thought Hurd would leave it in  but pulled to 3H|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Levin "do you want to know about our leads"?|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: if Piekarek is convinced by all of this, he may save in five diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: from his point of view, his opponents have a considerable black-suit fit with nothing breaking badly for them|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: top of nothing|pg||
nt|dburn: but he might have bid 4@d over 3@s - I'm not quite sure why he felt he should reject his partner's 3@d try|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dburn: still, he has done the right thing|pg||
nt|jlrice: i agree    i wouldnt want to bid 5@d now     i could have raised to 4 and let partner decide|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jlrice: everyone leads high from doubletons  :)|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@s doubled would have been a precarious business - it would probably go down a trick|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@h is not a percarious business - it is a hopeless case|pg||
nt|jlrice: but at least you arent trying to beat game at the 2 level|pg||
nt|jlrice: defense could have problems if they dont switch to hearts|pg||
nt|jlrice: but i dont think will be a problem|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - they had better make sure they play a second round of diamonds|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|jlrice: Hamman made an aggressive overcall here   I usually dont like overcalling 1nt on flat minimums|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|dburn: would have worked well for Lall to guess to use "garbage Stayman" and bail out into 2@s|pg||
nt|dburn: but his decision to pass is normal enough - just unfortunate on this occasion|pg||
nt|jlrice: he was probably afraid of the 2@D bid |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|jlrice: not the best of leads   gives up an extra heart trick but they were never going to set this contract anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: but a hearth shift won't hurt for the moment|pg||
nt|jlrice: they needed to start hearts and when they get in with spade will force the ruff to set |pg||
nt|dburn: well, diamonds would have forced dummy just as effectively|pg||
nt|jlrice: they could play 2 diamonds but when they knock out spade ace would then have to play on hearts or else declarer could just duck a club if they forced a second ruff|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sT|nt|dburn: mind you, it may not be so hopeless now|pg||
nt|dburn: Hurd has made a pretty good fist of it, and Levin might have needed to shift to a club there|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|dburn: Pepsi did opt for Stayman at the other table, but 2@s didn't quite fetch|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|jlrice: i still think he is short a trick|pg||
nt|jlrice: nope my mistake    GIB is so useful|pg||
nt|dburn: I'm not so sure|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|atlantajon: another @d?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|jlrice: they are still going to have to lose a spade and a diamond for down 2|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jlrice: and a push|pg||
nt|dburn: if he draws trumps, ruffs a diamond and plays a club to the jack, what can Levin do?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h7|pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|dburn: this looks like two down - ace and a heart might have worked better|pg||
nt|dburn: Bompis needed @cQ onside to make the contract|pg||
nt|jlrice: was a good play by bompis   needed club onside to make |pg||
mc|7|nt|dburn: but sadly, he will now go down about three|pg||
nt|jlrice: just happens to go down extra tricks if wrong|pg||
nt|dburn: or exactly three|pg||

nt|vugraphzps: Current Standings http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/2009/TEAMS1-FINALS.htm|pg||
nt|jlrice: no  just needed for W not to switch to diamond when he was in|pg||
nt|dburn: and that will be 8 IMPs for Rogoff, somewhat randomly|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|atlantajon: there will be some action here|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|dburn: so Goren can chalk up 6 IMPs for aggressive bidding, skilful play and a large slice of old-fashioned luck|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: i am not sure what 3D is?|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps a sound three-card raise|pg||
nt|jlrice: could be   might have also just had a diamond in with his hearts as well  |pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jlrice: 6H is a good contract   all of Ns values are working and hands fit well together|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|dburn: Weinstein is going to face an unenviable guess here|pg||
nt|jlrice: 3NT not a good contract but joel will need to find spade|pg||
nt|dburn: he needs to play on hearts before clubs to have any chance|pg||
nt|dburn: a question of guessing which side ace West holds, so as to knock that out first|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|henryb: 1@h was a transfer, showing 4-5 @s|pg||
nt|jlrice: are they playing a strong club system?|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|po-s: D2 lead would make life difficult but we won´t see that|pg||
nt|atlantajon: I was just thinking the same thing|pg||
nt|atlantajon: even now it is good|pg||
nt|atlantajon: Hello PO.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: I would guess that too much time has passed to fool Jeff with the 2@d now.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: he would get it right..|pg||
nt|atlantajon: a play like that needs to be in tempo.  win the A@h and lead the 2@d right away.|pg||
nt|jlrice: conservative pass by weinstein    a lot of people might invite with his hand   but does entice the opponents to come into the auction where they may go for a number|pg||
mb|6H|nt|dburn: well done indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: wrong guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: apparently, since Zimmerman bid game|pg||
nt|dburn: but this isn't so good|pg||
nt|jlrice: he can switch to hearts now  and hope that suit plays for one loser|pg||
nt|dburn: in truth, he probably needed to play a heart from the dummy at the second trick|pg||
nt|dburn: a play that would be impossible without having seen the hand records in advance|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: they did well to get there and will pick up 11 imps for their effort|pg||
nt|Jacki: http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/ For Kibbers Info|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|henryb: how would he make 4@s after a trump shift, a @d to the A and another trump? Isn't he a trick short?|pg||
nt|henryb: maybe not|pg||
nt|po-s: a few club ruff might help|pg||
nt|henryb: he can establish the fifth club|pg||
nt|po-s: ruffS|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: fast claim|pg||
nt|dburn: best for one loser in the spade suit is to begin with the ace|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jlrice: glubok will go down 2 or 3   but not doubled so wont be a bad score|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|dburn: at the other table, East attempted to apply pressure with a raise to 4@d|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|dburn: with about an 85% chance of collecting three tricks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jlrice: he might havev just played a heart thinking diamonds could easily be 6-3   and just tried to steal his 9th trick|pg||
nt|jlrice: i definitely would not suggest balancing with comptons hand though very little upside with partner a passed hand|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|jlrice: in clubs|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dburn: South doubled in fear and trembling, and must have felt like buying North a very large drink for bidding hearts and not spades|pg||
nt|jlrice: not likely to make anything given he was balanced 10 count|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h2|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|nt|henryb: usually 2@s over 1@h is a minimum with 4@s -- this auction is stronger|pg||

nt|jlrice: nice play by glubok to throw in weinstein and force him to lead away from his Q of hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: or it was, until declarer cashed the ace of spades|pg||
nt|jlrice: no line is 100%  spade could always break badly |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: still, no great harm befell him|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|dburn: some Norths might venture an overcall, but they would struggle to get out for down one if they did|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|henryb: every one has their own methods. some would play 2@h there as 6+ spades and 8+ points|pg||
nt|po-s: ew can make 4D|pg||
nt|henryb: N-S can make 3N :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|atlantajon: n/s can make 3nt|pg||
nt|atlantajon: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlrice: this is a very interesting one in defense    N needs to duck first spade|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jlrice: some Easts might bid over 1nt  i think they play 14-16 so hemant felt like he didnt quite have enough|pg||
nt|dburn: still, the tendency to come in over 1NT is not so strong at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|jlrice: but after that lead doesnt matter    both tables led the same|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|dK|pg||
nt|atlantajon: I bet Jeff is wishing he bid 3nt now.|pg||
nt|jlrice: with a diamond lead  this will be a fast contract will just hook the club |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
nt|jlrice: and claim|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|henryb: Interesting question whether to overcall 1@h or 1@d. If you are on defense you want a @h lead. If you think you may want to play the hand you have more @d, so that is likely to be ...|pg||
nt|henryb: a better trump suit|pg||
nt|dburn: that may have cost declarer a tempo|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
nt|jlrice: mahaffey overcalled 1@h instead of 1@d   gets partner to lead your better suit    but tough to get to 3@d|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|dburn: but only if South shifts to clubs, and that is a rather tough defense for him to find|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|henryb: notice that N-S can make 3@d|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jlrice: Hurd is playing the suit the only way to make extra tricks    if they are 3-3     |pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||
nt|jlrice: weinstein will probably have to get hearts correct to make this|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jlrice: at the other table N came into the bidding and EW found it was hard to stop|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer reluctant to play a club, since he'll go a lot down if the king loses to the ace|pg||
pc|h3|pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|s9|pg||
nt|jlrice: also your hearts are strong enough that if they have game a heart overcall could scare them out of 3NT thinking you might have 5 hearts off top|pg||
nt|jlrice: if he doesnt overtake Levin would just duck 1 round and will only be able to take 1 spade|pg||

nt|dburn: 4@h not a terrible contract for North-South, but going to be tricky on this lie of cards|pg||
nt|dburn: 3NT likewise|pg||
nt|dburn: although in the abstract 3NT is a very terrible contract|pg||
nt|dburn: but East may not lead a diamond - or West may save in his partner's minor|pg||
nt|jlrice: yes  in order for it to be good you need a non diamond lead and a good club break|pg||
nt|dburn: having sad that, what sort of a "save" is 4@d?|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe the defenders can force the East hand, to prevent the establishment of spades|pg||
nt|jlrice: wth everything breaking the way it is   it is a very good "save"|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: with the favorable @h and @s positions 6@h can be made, but it is not a good contract|pg||
nt|dburn: now, what do you suppose that means?|pg||
nt|dburn: lead a spade? lead your minor?|pg||
nt|jlrice: now hurd will bid 4@d i think   |pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzps: those 2@c where alerted|pg||
nt|dburn: at the other table, South tried 2@s in this auction|pg||
nt|dburn: considerate of East not to double 2@h at the other table|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dburn: and North carried him all the way to 6@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: i would take it as lead a spade with my partner   dont know how they play it|pg||
nt|dburn: we may be about to find out|pg||
mb|2D|nt|dburn: but if he does not lead a diamond, there is now a pretty good case for Levin to get the clubs right|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlrice: he has to hook at trick 2 |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: in fact I guess Deep finesse would say that N-S can make 7@h|pg||
nt|atlantajon: this must be a coded lead.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: or rusinow|pg||
nt|jlrice: i am a little aggressive with the bid but i like leaping michaels with N|pg||
nt|dburn: or at least, North carried him to 5@h - South then decided that since his spades might have been three small, his possession of @sA entitled him to bid a slam|pg||
nt|dburn: which would have made on a good day, if the 2@h opener had held the king of diamonds rather than hearts, say|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed he does, and that is of course a huge play|pg||
nt|dburn: but if he finds it, he will repair more than half the damage done to O'Rourke in the last few boards|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jlrice: might even make 7   but i would be happy to be in 4   wouldnt want to be in slam|pg||
nt|jlrice: yes    will win 15 i think if he does it  (i dont know scores that well)|pg||
nt|jlrice: 5@c is the winning contract on this board but tough to get to unless you open 1@c|pg||
nt|jlrice: even then it isnt so easy|pg||
nt|dburn: still, no one ever doubles anyone these days|pg||
nt|jlrice: i would not X either   |pg||
nt|dburn: largely because [a] partner never has anything when he opens the bidding and [b] double is always for takeout anyway|pg||
nt|jlrice: i dont want to hang partner  if he has bad hand  |pg||
nt|jlrice: it would have been for penalty though   he could have Xed the first time for takeout|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|atlantajon: on the @c lead you can easily|pg||
nt|dburn: today was not a good day, though, so that slam was two down, and if the defense here minds its work it can pick up 7 IMPs|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|dburn: well done|pg||
nt|jlrice: nice play|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d9|nt|dburn: he will score 950 for this, which will indeed be 15 IMPs|pg||
nt|dburn: if opening the bidding on a bad hand were a hanging offence, there would be precious few bridge players left alive|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d8|nt|po-s: good jack by Barry|pg||
nt|atlantajon: for the KIBS that are asking.....Rusinow leads are the lead of the second of touching cards.   the 9 shows the 10....the Q shows the K...etc.|pg||
nt|po-s: Club to king and club most likely - if North turns up with queen he will duck|pg||
nt|atlantajon: unless north plays the Q@c.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: then duck it|pg||
nt|po-s: if he ducks a club to South he is down|pg||
nt|atlantajon: as an avoidance type play.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: only duck if the Q is played.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: otherwise you are correct I think|pg||
nt|po-s: I think that´s what I said|pg||
nt|henryb: doen't he have 9 tricks by losing a @s|pg||
nt|atlantajon: it may be 2/4th.|pg||
nt|jlrice: that is what i thought the score was|pg||
nt|jlrice: plus  not a lot of upside of Xing unless you think you can get it multiple tricks   they knew they had roughly half the deck|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c3|nt|henryb: 4@s, 2@h, 2@c and a @d|pg||

nt|dburn: ...Wooldrige pitches his hearts, in which case he will score 1150 and 16 IMPs|pg||
nt|jlrice: joel was in tough spot   needed to throw either A or K of diamonds    but a small diamond would have probably done fine|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, Smirnov seems to have under-utilized his aces by a factor of 33%|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: most people will treat the hand the way glubok did as balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: Levin would cash out and give the last 3 tricks|pg||
mb|1S|nt|atlantajon: Limit raise by south?|pg||
nt|jlrice: i would XX showing points   otherwise just 1 level bump|pg||
nt|dburn: so that Quantin got out for down, one, and Faigenbaum added another couple of IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: this is a slam, although you had better play in spades (at least in theory)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|atlantajon: can the 1@C be right?|pg||
nt|jlrice: 6@d is a good contract     6@h is also good but can be set with diamond rough|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: 4333   and partner might not have full values for overcall|pg||
nt|jlrice: it isnt a very good 10 count   and would hate to go high quickly  might hang partner|pg||
nt|atlantajon: I agree Jon.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: he had 2 choices of Q bids there....I play the 2@d shows the weaker hand....while 2@h is the opening hand.|pg||
nt|dburn: not so easy to reach six of anything, but not entirely impossible|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jlrice: 3D was probably a mixed raise though|pg||
nt|atlantajon: How do you play the Jump Q Jon?|pg||
nt|jlrice: i would play as mixed normally|pg||
nt|jlrice: i dont like coming into this auction with S hand   too many times you will get Xed and have very few tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: Lev and Pszczola could not manage it given a free run|pg||
nt|dburn: and despite West being able to show his hand pretty well|pg||
nt|dburn: and you had better get the trumps right, which is not so easy on the bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: but if Weinstein jumps to six diamonds, as well he might, Hurd is not going to lead a spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: N-S are now in a gf with no game to be made|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but Levin will still have to play the spades to advantage|pg||
mb|p|nt|atlantajon: As would I....but that gives him 3 choices of 4 card raises.|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, Lall appears to have had no difficulty at all|pg||
nt|dburn: one argument for doubling these contracts is that at least if gets you to focus properly on the defence|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dburn: and there is a case for playing to the king, given that East is more or less marked with the ace and with long clubs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: not so much a free run as a flying leap|pg||
nt|dburn: however, Levin may be able to discover that East has two cards in each red suit|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn: and count him for 3=2=2=6 shape|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jlrice: i generally play neg free bids though so 2D might not have support|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: 3@d game try in @s|pg||
nt|henryb: I assume Goren stretched to open a forcing 1@c|pg||
nt|atlantajon: that is what I think.|pg||
nt|jlrice: yes opps helped out by forcing them to just guess|pg||
pc|hA|nt|atlantajon: but it is a big upgrade.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|atlantajon: there is not much play here.  with the A@h offside.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|atlantajon: 2/3 of the hand is in AJ AJ....|pg||
nt|po-s: the alternative is that he pulled the wrong card...|pg||
nt|atlantajon: that is posible.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: possible|pg||
nt|henryb: also possible|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dburn: facing a one-level opening bid rather than a weak two bid, and being forced to guess over 5@c, Lall's action was brave but reasonable - however....|pg||
pc|s7|nt|dburn: though he may not have enough entries to cash three rounds of hearts and lead spades twice towards dummy|pg||
nt|dburn: at any rate, he isn't troubling with any of that, and Hurd has probably dwelt too long already on his play to this trick|pg||
pc|c5|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d5|nt|dburn: still, Levin may conceivably go wrong now|pg||
nt|jlrice: at least he is forcing him to guess now   if he waited til later he definitely would get the information to get it right|pg||
nt|jlrice: but should hook or hurd probably would have ducked with Ax|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he might have done|pg||
nt|jlrice: he could have been afraid of getting endplayed later though|pg||
nt|dburn: but then declarer, if he were 3=3=5=2, could put up the king, eliminate hearts and clubs from the East hand, and play a spade|pg||
nt|dburn: still, West is very likely to be short in something - he did bid 5@c, vulnerable against not|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Levin is showing his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: This is my hand he said|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: still thinking|pg||
nt|dburn: good plan - maybe he hopes Hurd will show his|pg||
nt|jlrice: he shouldnt do that|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dburn: well done|pg||

mb|p|nt|dburn: ...on reflection Hamman might feel that he ought to have played the 5@c bidder for a void rather than the 2@c bidder|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jlrice: NS stole the contract here   5H can be made EW|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|dburn: twelve tricks at the other table looks a fine achievement|pg||
nt|dburn: at this one, 1NT is four spades and a longer minor|pg||
nt|jlrice: yes   E ducked his diamond twice|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT = 4 card major and 5+ minor I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: another chance for Levin to shine and for O'Rourke to gain a big swing|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|jlrice: should be a big swing to zimmerman|pg||
nt|atlantajon: I would think so.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: even if they defend 4@s it is surely going to be X'd.|pg||
nt|jlrice: at the other table  auction went 3@s-4@s  and Lev didnt want to come in with W hand|pg||
nt|atlantajon: east thinking about slam??|pg||
nt|atlantajon: he has a good hand for @H contract.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: and his partner freely bid 4@h.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: the 3 small @s's is actually a good thing.|pg||
nt|jlrice: the problem with coming in is that you could be going for 800  if you partner has nothing   but you could be giving up a game swing if he has the right cards|pg||
nt|po-s: more fun if Weswt had played a spade after the hearts. Declarer would have taken his spades, then overtaken the clubs to produce one more undertrick|pg||
nt|jlrice: he might have figured he needed the void in order to overcall that horrible hand|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C = "pass, or correct to 2@D"|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c = to play in the minor|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jlrice: over 4S|pg||
nt|po-s: dangerous...|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jlrice: especially after jumper led Ace|pg||
mb|4H|nt|po-s: or two|pg||
nt|dburn: or perhaps Weinstein will become declarer at six clubs|pg||
nt|jlrice: just need to get clubs correct for 6 to make   |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: indeed, but if South really were void in diamonds, he would almost certainly have had a few spades, and might have entered the auction with a double and not an overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: In the other room it was strongly suggested that West should bid 5H over 2S-4S|pg||
nt|atlantajon: looks like the doubleton 10@c makes this hand....a place for the @h loser.|pg||
nt|dburn: though 6NT is probably where you would like to play|pg||
nt|jlrice: they have wrong sided diamonds so that a club lead can beat them  |pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|dburn: but that may not be easy to discover|pg||
pc|cA|nt|atlantajon: 4@s does look like kickback.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|atlantajon: 2 with the Q?|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure what this bidding means|pg||
nt|jlrice: not exactly sure myself |pg||
nt|petergill: 11 tricks look inevitable|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|jlrice: i would take it that way   but 5@d would show 2 without then so not|pg||
nt|po-s: Well, what would East have done if West "freely" bids 5H?|pg||
nt|dburn: but that was a 25-IMP decision - 13 for Mahaffey instead of 12 for Hamman|pg||
nt|dburn: but if Weinstein converts to six diamonds, Wooldrige may double|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|henryb: losing a trick in each suit?|pg||
nt|dburn: and then it will be up to someone to convert to 6NT|pg||

nt|vugraphzps: next match in some minutes, hope to see you all here|pg||
nt|dburn: at the other table, declarer in 6@d by South received a heart lead, so he ruffed a heart, drew trumps and led a low club to his queen|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dburn: but if they sell out to 6@s, that might give declarer the clue he needs to get the trumps right|pg||
nt|dburn: a line of play that was not at all best, and met the fate it deserved|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dburn: of course, Zhao might take out insurance himself|pg||
nt|petergill: Exciting hand here, with slam possible. |pg||
nt|jlrice: yes 6@C can be made|pg||
mb|3S|nt|dburn: but if he passes slowly, there will be some pressure on Fu|pg||
nt|dburn: and he will be a much-relieved man to find that he has gained a couple of IMPs instead of losing a million|pg||
nt|petergill: Smirnov - Piekarek came 4th in the World Championship in Beijing last year, playing for Germany. |pg||
nt|petergill: Some experts would respond 2@C, not 1@H, to the 1@d opening. |pg||
mb|4C|nt|jlrice: partner would have tough decision on bumping to 6   if he is willing to try for slam on this auction surely he would bump to 6 on 3s P 4S 5H|pg||
nt|dburn: and if he doubles... well, maybe that is one of these non-penalty slam doubles, but there is some danger here|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: the X was alerted|pg||
nt|dburn: still, Hamman's pass to 6@d more or less confirms his void, so that Fu is likely to save anyway|pg||
nt|jlrice: i think bidding 7 should be done    you arent going to do worse than game their way|pg||
nt|jlrice: i would respond 2@C   lets partner know we have game and it is my longest suit|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C now ... then perhaps 4@H preference - I'm just guessing|pg||
nt|jlrice: plus more likely to keep opps out of auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jlrice: good lead by mahaffey   need  to get club ruff off top to set|pg||
nt|atlantajon: all roads lead to 12 tricks....13 if they miss leading the @c.|pg||
nt|jlrice: the 4@s sac did not do so well in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|po-s: which card should East play?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well done by Fu - now Lall has to avoid bidding seven himself|pg||
nt|petergill: Due to the expected spade intervention, given his void and the prevailing vulnerabilty, West preferred to get his hearts into the auction early, before the inevitable spade ...|pg||
nt|petergill: preemption.|pg||
nt|petergill: East has a guess now - he might bid 5NT = pick a slam |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: 2NT some form of "good-bad" - 3@d instead would have shown a good hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: which would have led to 6@C|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: so the French win the match on the last board|pg||
nt|jlrice: as it turns out slam is on a finesse or a good diamond break   assuming a trump lead  so cant fault them for not bidding it|pg||
nt|petergill: The next match is due not long after this match finishes|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to our operator Catalina Robles for a good job. |pg||
pc|d2|nt|dburn: unless of course he bids seven hearts, which he could make, but that is not really on the menu|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jlrice: this wont be easiest contract to defend|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, pass was alos an option - East did have fair defence against hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: still, if he makes it, he will be forgiven|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Last hand of this round, we will be back in some minutes with round 6, last one of today|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|po-s: seems hard to deal with the five|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, Levin may have to let Weinstein ruff this|pg||
nt|dburn: rather than putting up the king|pg||
nt|jlrice: levin needs to duck |pg||
nt|dburn: still, at least he knows that the lead was a singleton|pg||
nt|dburn: since it was the @h3 and the !2 is in dummy|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jlrice: if they play standard you play low   his partner will know he has odd|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jlrice: on a diamond lead will have no problems making this   needed to start clubs immiediately to have shot at setting|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jlrice: yes   why play a different fit when you already have a known 11 card fit|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|atlantajon: looks like declarer is playing for doubleton J@d|pg||
nt|jlrice: if you play high  he still might have doubleton which would encourage playing the king|pg||
nt|atlantajon: to park a @h|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|po-s: with JT5 North must play the 5 in all methods|pg||
nt|atlantajon: since he created an entry in @c by unblocking the 10|pg||
pc|s4|nt|dburn: well done - Levin is on pretty good form today|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c9|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|jlrice: well   hmm   sorry i was answering questions thinking wrong hand was on table  lol|pg||
nt|jlrice: might not change my answers though|pg||
nt|atlantajon: why wouldn't any south lead a big @c?|pg||
nt|atlantajon: it seems like the normal lead to me.|pg||
nt|atlantajon: I did.|pg||
nt|jlrice: if passell and multon club suits are switched could be devestating lead|pg||
nt|jlrice: for defense that is|pg||
nt|atlantajon: so...this is the second of 6 rounds for today?|pg||
nt|jlrice: yes|pg||
nt|jlrice: i am assuming after 3 they will put results of afternoon set on the website|pg||
nt|atlantajon: so...we have 1 more round...then they will break?|pg||
nt|atlantajon: I assume the same.|pg||
