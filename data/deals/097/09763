mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Raisiing on a void is not often done|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: I would have bid 4@C, on the grounds that my failure to bid 3@C over 21HX marked me with only four clubs. |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|petergill: Curtis could deduce that LHO did not have @HKx (no 3NT bid) and RHO might have @HK, hence no @H lead. |pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|petergill: Down one is my guess, but it is a wild guess|pg||

pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|hQ|nt|petergill: 4th club, pitch @HQ to limit communications?|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, he plays like he can see all 52 cards|pg||
nt|petergill: @SQ now perhaps, to try to put RHO on lead?|pg||

nt|vugraphzps: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Joe said he could had bid 1s joking with East|pg||
mb|1H|nt|petergill: Good defence by Cheek, after his unlucky choice of lead. . |pg||
mb|4C|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|petergill: 5@D on the last board might have been interesting - a trump lead might make it hard|pg||
mb|5D!|an|1|mb|p|nt|petergill: Will he bid 6@H or 6NT? |pg||
nt|petergill: 5@D = one????|pg||
mb|6N|nt|petergill: A tiredness slip on the 2nd last board?|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: thats what he said with his hands, |pg||
nt|vugraphzps: now he said he showed 1 as|pg||

mc|9|nt|vugraphzps: Ok ill leave it open and ill bring some standings|pg||
nt|petergill: When NS are in Heat One, they find the heart lead then the trumps don't break. C'est la vie. |pg||
nt|petergill: I know some experts who would lead a @d from that South hand|pg||
nt|petergill: Several expert specs would have led a @D|pg||
nt|petergill: The Italians might overcall 1@H on the North cards, even opposite a passed hand. That is the Italian style. Not the American sryle.   |pg||
nt|petergill: David Stern has gone off to try to get updated scores for you. |pg||
nt|petergill: David might have to wait for the other tables to finish play before they will release them, then he will type them for you here. |pg||
nt|vugraphzps: session leaders with one round to go   cheek-grue; fallenius-fredin; levin weinstein; levin-meyers|pg||
nt|petergill: Anyone think Grue - Cheek have moved up from16th to 2nd this session? My guess is they are about 4th now, with Levin - Weinstein still far ahead. |pg||
nt|vugraphzps: overall with one round to go   levin-weinstein; grue-cheek; helgemo-helness|pg||
nt|petergill: So Grue - Cheek won both Sessions 3 and 4. Well done|pg||
