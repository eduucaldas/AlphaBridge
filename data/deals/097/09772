nt|petergill: When NS are in Heat One, they find the heart lead then the trumps don't break. C'est la vie. |pg||
nt|petergill: I know some experts who would lead a @d from that South hand|pg||
nt|petergill: Several expert specs would have led a @D|pg||
nt|petergill: The Italians might overcall 1@H on the North cards, even opposite a passed hand. That is the Italian style. Not the American sryle.   |pg||
nt|petergill: David Stern has gone off to try to get updated scores for you. |pg||
nt|petergill: David might have to wait for the other tables to finish play before they will release them, then he will type them for you here. |pg||

nt|ppiglett: 11-16 North with 4 diamonds? should you push for game with 16-18 count with East or play in a dimaond partial?|pg||
nt|garnetts: If you double a 1NT overcall you need to agree that the opps cannot be left in an undoubled partscore|pg||

nt|ppiglett: As Larry Cohen said last night in comentary in the Cavendish - when you know they are playing in an 8 card fit at the 2 level and trumps are breaking - you have to compete.|pg||
nt|tomi2: The wirls team will be (like some others) missing their strongest player (Joanna Krawczyk) because she want to be part of the juniors (U26) Team there|pg||

nt|tomi2: the schedule in the Europeans allowes you to play both, the girls and the U21 series but not girls and U26|pg||
