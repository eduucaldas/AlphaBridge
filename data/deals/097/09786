nt|lestergold: hi Sid |pg||
nt|vugraphzrb: We are waiting for East/West to arrive|pg||
nt|lestergold: south has a more impressive red suit but the duplication in clubs means this is e/ws hand|pg||
nt|newmoon: hi all|pg||
nt|newmoon: lester :)|pg||

nt|newmoon: the last CC for n/s online I have is here:  http://tinyurl.com/o5pesw|pg||
nt|newmoon: n/s are die-hards for weak nt, multi and 4-card majors|pg||
nt|lestergold: sounds something like old style acol|pg||
nt|lestergold: hardly played in UK these days|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Marshall Lewis|pg||

nt|lestergold: hi Marshall|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well we are impatient to witness an auction on these somewhat misfitting  hjands|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|newmoon: Cope/Holman played a 2/1, udca  in Shanghai|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 5-card majors, strong NT for E-W, 2/1 game-forcing|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: just what west didnt want to hear|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: as is so often thecase with 20/20 hands the declaring side get too high|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Roger Bryant|pg||

nt|henryb: Hello all|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: in closed n/s allowed to play in a nt|pg||
nt|mariner1: and aggressive N or S could save this|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Hi all I thought David had a twin :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: This event is always one of the most thrilling on the calendar to play in|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Its also the most tiring|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you live on adrenalin for four days|pg||
nt|ady: quiet part score to start       though Alfrey has entered with a chancy 1NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: they 'd better run :)|pg||
nt|thegarve:  By Tuesday players are tired and there's only a few pwople in Straford and the atmosphere is a lot quieter|pg||
nt|bobholl: but where to :)|pg||
nt|ady: but run to where|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: but e/w can make upto 3s|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 1n has 7 tops|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: perhaps neither e or west has quite enuf to enter auction|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Henry|pg||
nt|viren169: Despite their seed... they have been the main favorites throughout the event...|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 @D or 3nt ?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|werge: Let´s say 300|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: will suffer here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if they run form 1Nx, they will end in something else doubled |pg||
nt|thegarve:  last Year at breakfast on Tuesady and before play commenced you could see it in the faces of all the players|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|athene: you don't really need much from partner for game|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bobholl: even on a @H lead 3NT is "cold"|pg||
nt|sharkey: no - Erichsen keeps it simple |pg||
nt|henryb: really? |pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well a push and out|pg||
nt|viren169: either 3@D or 3N works here...|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  I would have bid Stayman as East and we may have ended up in 2DX|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: how would you avoid losing 3@h, a @d and the @sK?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6 @D 1 @S 1@H but collect all ??!|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 @C |pg||
nt|bobholl: even 2 @S|pg||
pc|dA|nt|thegarve:  as West|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure taking the A was right at trick 1...|pg||
nt|athene: this does the defence's job for them|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|lestergold: we can see that there is nothing to the hand 1n with no overtricks|pg||
nt|athene: but it wasn't a trivial declarer problem|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: looks like might get our for -300  |pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: not sure I understand @H play|pg||
nt|athene: if he just played on diamonds he is cut off from his @CA|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h2|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: and it's very hard for the defence to return the suit declarer attacks|pg||
nt|viren169: was afraid of the heart switch... and ended up playing heart himself!|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|henryb: he needed a 9th trick before he set up 8|pg||
nt|athene: so the heart play was a mixture of @HA right and south not returning a heart if it was wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We lost the open room I'm afraid. Last year was a disaster as far as connections were concerned. Let's hope for better luck now (bad start one has to say)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|nt|werge: Did´nt they have 500 during the play - strange to discard a @s from dummy|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: cl|pg||
nt|bobholl: well  it worked :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|h7|nt|lestergold: so can declarer|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|h8|mc|9|nt|athene: certainly the 1NT response would normally deny four hearts but south will look silly winning @HA and returning @HJ if declarer has @H10xx|pg||

mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: Our operator now is Carol Grunder; good evening to you|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|newmoon: North:  too strong for the weak NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzrb: Hello all|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|lestergold: of course even in 3n some views to take but 4s has no real chance|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|lestergold: do not agree with the 3s bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: noth's hand is not actually strong enuf for 3s altho very good for 2s|pg||
pc|h3|nt|newmoon: 4@S in CR after a strong NT opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: argument for north showing here strong nop trump opposite the spade response|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She can't handle the 5-0 break. Unlucky, but you get that break 4% of the time, a priori|pg||
nt|lestergold: but again its likely to be flat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3-2  68   4-1  28   5-0  4|pg||
nt|lestergold: very hard for n/s not to play in 4s|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n off on dim lead in any case |pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are in Wilderness, Western Cape, South Africa. Lovely scenery I have been told. I guess Sid can confirm that|pg||
nt|vugraphzrb: The Cope team have a 12 IMP carryover from the qualifying match|pg||
nt|lestergold: actual;ly not necessarily 4s 4c and a dim trick are available|pg||

nt|mariner1: 6 of either minor missed in Closed Room|pg||

nt|mariner1: in Closed Room I meant 3@S jammed|pg||
nt|thegarve:  may have been an operator misclick|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 6s not vul doubled is 800 against 1370|pg||
nt|sharkey: appears NS can make 3@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: preempt in @C ?|pg||
nt|werge: Yes, I think so|pg||
nt|werge: 1 @H from South - or?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  leaning oevr Robson's shoulder to see the play can be hard work|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: too good for a pre-empt|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but im not expecting par to be reached on this hand|pg||

nt|thegarve:  looks like a solid vul weak two|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|mariner1: I think they find slam now|pg||
nt|lestergold: should do easily now|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3s succeeded in stopping them in closed|pg||
nt|xenya: are we sure 3@D shows a strong hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: its amazing that can make so much difference|pg||
nt|mariner1: it would to me|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: on eextra level removed|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: clearly NS play double of the artificial raise as t/o of clubs - not showing diamonds|pg||
nt|henryb: I would bid 3@h as South, but 2@h certainly worked well|pg||
nt|sharkey: why not 1 NT with West's hand - 8-10 balanced i presume|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: Network a bid dicky, so fingers crossed today!!|pg||
nt|bobholl: which is  good :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|werge: Never - with 40 % of your values in side suits...!|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: most expert pairs have some sort of agreement here but it's easy to have misunderstandings|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: oh well|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3d doesnt promise a strong hand but northn now knows that he is enormous with all his cards in his partners suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3h a silly bid|pg||
nt|werge: Even 63 %|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: he has |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: his pard has shown 9 plus car5ds  in the minors- either game in a minor or slam surely |pg||
nt|viren169: when you have a gadget in your kitbag... I guess you just have to use it!|pg||
nt|thegarve:  only 50 in 4@S so maybe a swing|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3d is inadequate if al you are going to do is sign off in 3n after ur pard has shown some values|pg||
nt|ady: seems the re-bids vary after 2NT force     some play 4@H minimum   which seems to fit with souths hand|pg||
nt|werge: 4 @S might go for 500|pg||
pc|s7|nt|henryb: I would certainly play it takeout of clubs|pg||
nt|thegarve:  500 i mistyped |pg||
pc|s2|nt|viren169: Nothing wrong with Nick Irens!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: at end of the day both players have failed to show partner anything like their full assets|pg||

nt|bobholl: pressure bid always good |pg||
nt|viren169: nice bid!|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D looks the normal action|pg||
nt|henryb: I think it depends a little on whether 1@d promises 4 or could be 3. |pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 @C ruffs are enough and simple to accomplish|pg||
nt|werge: On a !-lead, 3 NT depends on the right fines - but with @C 4-4, you can afford a wrong guess |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: and the "sactifice" makeable to boot!|pg||
nt|sharkey: now underbid...|pg||
nt|bobholl: +1 now :)|pg||
nt|henryb: If it could be 3, perhaps a little more restraint|pg||
nt|athene: goodbye, @H loser|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: should be held to 2h|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually an interesting position because a trump trick can be promoted here|pg||
nt|mariner1: a @D lead allows N to ruff a @D|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, it can be set|pg||
nt|lestergold: however hard for defence to get that second trump and also enjoyn an ultimate diamond trick|pg||
nt|viren169: not the best of leads... but a tough lead to find from that collection... |pg||
nt|werge: @c-lead|pg||
nt|ady: another routine hand in 3NT   n/s      hardly swingy hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well what a lead|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|ady: well unless you play AK spades before in case of queen doubleton and then finess heart you will make|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|lestergold: must ash spade ace and then play second club|pg||
nt|xenya: but it's not over yet|pg||
nt|lestergold: far from ove|pg||
nt|lestergold: to beat this is almost double dummy defence|pg||
nt|xenya: in practice, E needs to cash @SA now|pg||
nt|lestergold: because dummy has to be cut off|pg||
nt|ady: now no problem|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: see above i said that already|pg||
nt|werge: Suppose, you "know" that @c´s are 5-3, you might try Ace-king of @S and then the @H-finesse|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hA|nt|thegarve:  no smith peter so a @C switch|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sharkey: in view of the fact you're prepared to sacrifice in 5@D - if opps bid game - you may as well bid it right away.  And, as in this case, the bonus is you make game|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
nt|athene: a trump lead was a possibility on west's hand, but he has all the entries and only one trump, so it's not likely to be that effective - leading a trump doesn't usually achieve much ...|pg||
nt|athene: unless the defence can get a second (and maybe third) round led|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: it might be safe, but little more|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bobholl: too late :)|pg||

nt|athene: scared of @CK, @C10 back ruffed, @HA, @C ruff|pg||
nt|henryb: on the other hand it would be silly to duck the @c if it is a singleton. that would be the only possible way to go down|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|lestergold: hm|pg||
nt|marlowepi: extremely conservative action by S I would say, even facing a passed hand. surely 2S is safe|pg||
pc|c5|nt|newmoon: and thanks to Alan Dawson who manned the Vugraph intermittently   :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: very odd|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: not bidding 2s with south|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would have bid it the first time|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|lestergold: i would think so indeed|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: gross underbidding and norths protection what about that?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: i know the hand is passed but very feeble hand|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|newmoon: good chance for a dble-partial swing|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe south has seen her partners protective bids before!|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe S believes the best protection is abstinence|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: well klets be honest even if its rude- uare unlikely to get rich defending 2c especially when you know that you have a 4/4 spade fit and at least half the pack|pg||
