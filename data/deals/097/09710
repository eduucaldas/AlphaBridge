nt|vugraphzpr: Cohler|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb: Seamon might have done better to let bis partner double 1@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: Cohler realizes the value of the @C Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: Seamon asks about carding|pg||
nt|wordmew: fortunate dbltn. club 9 brings this home|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mslair: cohler has hit a homerun  |pg||
nt|mslair: looks to be the best lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: Thought he hit a home run when he got you as  a partner years bac;0k|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mslair: he didn't think so:)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzpr: Seamon thinking|pg||
nt|atlantajon: Welcome back all|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: folds up his hand puts his palm to his chin and leans in|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: asks for the opps convention card and lowers the screen|pg||
nt|mslair: with hearts 3-3  he can't mishandle clubs|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|henryb: not obvious to overtake but North's fear in 1@cX is a clue: with A9xxx he might have sat it out|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|mslair: great result for seamon/cohler|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: They could force declarer to guess spades right?|pg||
nt|atlantajon: and just enough hand entries to bring home 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|mslair: very good might be a more apt description|pg||
nt|atlantajon: I agree mark.....this is going to be a big IMP swing for them|pg||
nt|henryb: Meyers and Levin stopped in 2N|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mslair: the spade bluff is the only possible  |pg||
nt|atlantajon: there is no bluff.|pg||
nt|wordmew: 3 back|pg||
nt|mslair: spade to the ace and annother spade  he has to guess|pg||
nt|mslair: y  3 is best|pg||
nt|atlantajon: but the last @s will be the 9|pg||
nt|atlantajon: so there is no guess|pg||
nt|mslair: if seamon plays spade 10 on 3rd round playing Bompis for A65|pg||
nt|atlantajon: true|pg||
nt|henryb: but S might have responded with a K and four spades|pg||
nt|atlantajon: He could do that...but south then bids 1@s over the XX.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: That isnt possible. With 4H Bompis would have established those|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: must be 4-3-2-4|pg||
nt|mslair: spade 3 followed by spade 6   would be very interesting  if the 6 comes back rapid fire|pg||
nt|henryb: or bid 1@s rather than 1@d with four|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: Bompis thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: sorry Quantinn|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|h6|pg||

mb|1H|mb|2D|mb|d|mb|4D|nt|atlantajon: E/W have a good 5@d Sac.|pg||
nt|po-s: he thinks you are a dummy?|pg||
nt|henryb: even a good 6@d sac over 5@s|pg||
nt|atlantajon: and the only thing that keeps it from making is the 10@h in north hand.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: Someone whistling very loudly in the room|pg||
mb|d|an|take out|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|po-s: latest trend i signalling|pg||
nt|henryb: now that they have im-ped-iments?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: to give you an idea of how the room is set up. We are in a ballroom and the tables are divided by curtains going around the perimeter. With a cluster inn the middle of the room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|vugraphzpr: so easy to hear noise from all over the room|pg||

nt|atlantajon: Gary is looking at AKQ and an A|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|atlantajon: he might be beating 4@s.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|henryb: I think it is Gary's: he knows @d are solid|pg||
nt|mslair: both were scared of pushing opps to slam   |pg||
nt|atlantajon: right.....that also...Mark|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|po-s: not really|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpr: 5 min warning|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mslair: if not worried about "that"  they both had easy 5 diamond bids|pg||
