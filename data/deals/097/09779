nt|Walddk2: True|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Wladow is from Bulgaria originally, Elinescu from Romania, but they have both been living in Germany for decades|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: England have imported some great players from other countries too.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|henryb: double negative or transfer?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|brolucius: And, of course, such as Zia now play for the USA.|pg||
nt|henryb: and Pepsi and Lev|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I told you, David; we would get a 1NT contract shortly. I keep my promises|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|brolucius: I wonder if I will be disciplined enough not to comment on the fact that the contract is 1NT. Ah, no, I have failed the test.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Fallenius and many many others|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|c3|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see that Connie Goldberg and Bill Eisenberg, who was described as a 'House' pair and did not take part in the auction, are very respectably placed in 15th position. Nice effort.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I  suppose that if they have a great session and rise into one of the prize positions, they will have to ignore them in respect of allocating the prize money.|pg||
nt|jbgood: and only some 300 imps behind the money|pg||
nt|henryb: they are both good players -- Billy needs no one to speak for him -- and the play together quite a lot|pg||
nt|brolucius: How many places are in the money, Jon?|pg||
nt|jbgood: 10|pg||
nt|Walddk2: + winners of last session|pg||
nt|jbgood: and of course the session bonuses|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|henryb: there are session prizes for each session, doubled in the last|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|jbgood: Levin - Weinstein have collected 13 500 in bonuses for the owners so far|pg||
nt|Walddk2: session awards to 5th in last set|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1-5 that is|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s6|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|henryb: Grue and Cheek probably have more with their two wins|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|brolucius: Jom Mahaffey bought the top six pairs in the auction, for some $240,000 and will do OK out of it with Levin-Weinstein miles in the lead and Helgemo-Helness also featuring well.|pg||
mc|8|nt|Walddk2: http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/2009/PAIRS5O.htm  for standings after session 4 of 5. There will be no running scores during the last session|pg||
nt|brolucius: Jim...|pg||

nt|henryb: but he almost certainly sold some of them to others.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Wladow will open something in 3rd seat I am sure|pg||
nt|jbgood: or parts ..|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|henryb: some of each, and the pairs will have bought a portion back|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Staying low is best here, perhaps 2NT|pg||
nt|jbgood: they have to buy 10 % - and may buy up to 40 % if i am not mistaken|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: West will probably have to make a try... oh, he has bid game!|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: not a friendly hand for east with the @cK, the @hQ both wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But invites hardly exist these days, so game it is|pg||
nt|jbgood: the Swedish game try: Bid game|pg||
nt|henryb: me, I would pass 2@s non-vul|pg||
nt|brolucius: West has 10 awful cards in his hand. He must have added a bit for that.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: 1@D has little to do with diamonds in their methods, so Elinescu may try something different|pg||
nt|jbgood: at these colors it is very marginal to say the least|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And he has|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|brolucius: With such awful intermediate, and N-V, West had a borderline 2NT continuation as I see it.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d4|nt|brolucius: In England the Swedish Game Try (jumping to game on insufficient values) is known as the 'Landy Game Try', after Sandra Landy - a forward bidder and former women's world champion.|pg||
nt|jbgood: even Peter cannot make gold from pebbles|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many players try that sort of thing on the first board of a match, to shake up the opponents if it happens to make. To stamp their authority on proceedings. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: The comforting issue for E-W is that even 2NT can't make on best defence|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|brolucius: I have mentioned before that I used to have an annoying team member, who made frequent use of the excuse: 'Well, it didn't matter, even 2NT would have gone down.' In that case even ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: MORE reason not to bid 3NT.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jbgood: or even 2 NT:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, as someone said, you might well not bid 2NT in a matchpoint event.|pg||
nt|brolucius: West is now down to a six-high hand.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c6|nt|henryb: those extra two and three imps add up over time with the five or six every once in a while|pg||
pc|h8|nt|brolucius: After another trick, he will have a winning hand for Low Poker|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h2|pg||

nt|Walddk2: This would have been a passout 50 years ago, but not today|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: I will offer E-W $5 each to rescue us from 1NT by North. Will be 2@H, I expect. |pg||
nt|henryb: really? I cannot imagine passing N: even Culbertson thought you should open two acea and a king|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I must agree with David. Apart from board 1, the hands have been extrmely dull|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Normally when I say that, I have halfway through a bottle of some worthy wine. At present, I have only a coffee before me, so it must be an accurate analysis.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did you ask Al Roth, Henry?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|d|nt|brolucius: Excellent protection from West. I must mail him $5.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@D will play well, but Elinescu won't sit for it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb: trying for -470|pg||
nt|jbgood: match point action|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh, he did|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|brolucius: Well, they have made an apparently dull board exciting. Well done, those men!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't understand Wladow's double I must confess. Did he not bid his hand already?|pg||
nt|henryb: now the question is whether he has succeeded|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jbgood: Fredin will make this|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's double, on a 12-count, shows that he has pair full respect to his partner's earlier double of 2NT. Both are borderline for their actions.|pg||
nt|brolucius: ..paid..|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe the double of 2NT created a force. In that case I don't understand Elinescu's double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are playing Precision and open all 11 and many 10 counts|pg||
nt|brolucius: Elinescu's double was showing a maximum for his pass of 2@H. In that respect he had his bid. I don;t see how it can set up a force, nor why North then thought he was worthe any ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: action over 3@D.|pg||
