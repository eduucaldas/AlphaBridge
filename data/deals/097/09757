mb|1D!|an|could be 2|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|dburn: strong club for North-South, by the look of it|pg||
mb|r!|an|Support|mb|1N|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb: gee. I would have doubled 1N|pg||

nt|henryb: looks like he will make an easy 140|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: A poor photo of me is there for next 3 minutes till the next auto photo happens|pg||
nt|reisig: yes ...140 seems easy enough|pg||
nt|henryb: but he had an equally easy 500 available|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: he would probably have defended 2@d, not 1NT, and it would not have been so easy to double that|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Maybe 170 now ??|pg||
nt|henryb: but he had at east 500 there also|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|an|Alerted|mb|3D|nt|reisig: 3@d ...perfect shape :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Dohble here would yield PAHLENTY|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpt: 2-3-0-3 for 8 bills|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|henryb: 9 tricks on defense?|pg||
nt|dburn: for example, 3@d doubled here would cost about 1100, but it won't happen|pg||
mb|5C|nt|vugraphzpt: I can see 8 where are 9|pg||
nt|henryb: be easier to pass if partner had opened a natural 1@c|pg||
nt|dburn: instead, North-South will reach a daft contract that will make|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Ah can pitch spade on club and get ruff in that suit too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb: three clubs, two hearts, two spades, a heart ruff and a spade ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: As my mum says double and you dont have to defend so welll|pg||

pc|c8|pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|dburn: and North-South are also cold for 3@d - pity East-West got there first|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||

nt|vugraphzpt: There is certainly some reluctance to punish when people interfere over a strong club - the strong club side usually feel they are being talked out of something|pg||

nt|reisig: This is prob a good result for EW|pg||
nt|henryb: People are telling me North looks like Fred Stewart. are you sure this is Greco-Diamond?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Well picked I put in the pair running 42nd and not pair 42|pg||
nt|dburn: would Fred Stewart open 3@h with those North cards?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Thats why we have webcams|pg||

mc|7|nt|vugraphzpt: Closing and reopening|pg||
nt|henryb: this was a "why should you go down when I can" hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: momentarily|pg||
nt|henryb: will Levin Weinstein come here or grue cheek go there?|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, he might regret it - if he had opened only 2@h, East-West would probably have gone down in some game|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Next up Cohler Seamon|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Im breaking for 2 mins|pg||
nt|henryb: Ah|pg||
