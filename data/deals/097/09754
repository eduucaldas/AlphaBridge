pc|d5|nt|henryb: better chances when E does not lead a spade|pg||
nt|jlrice: it should make   shouldnt lose more than 2 hearts and a spade|pg||
nt|dburn: not make? why not?|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Will need some help from the deefence to avoid losing 2-2-0-0 but can pitch spades on clubs so will likely make I think|pg||
nt|henryb: on a spade lead no play|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: A spade lead may have sunk the conttract|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d7|pg||
nt|dburn: again, I am not sure|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: entry now gone to the spades|pg||
nt|henryb: really David?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzps: would still make if heart to King|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dburn: what could declarer do on a spade lead other than win the second round of the suit, play a heart to the king, and run clubs?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|jlrice: not exactly   the T of hearts becomes a very big card to have|pg||
nt|henryb: and East ruffs the fourth with the @hQ and West still has @hA10|pg||
mc|10|nt|dburn: so he does, sorry|pg||
nt|henryb: we will have a lot of down time at this table|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Then West has two trump tricks after east ruffs with the @HQ|pg||
nt|jlrice: might be able to do it without playing heart to K though|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Hmmm it must be late in england to catch out Burn|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: 02:00|pg||
nt|jlrice: on spade  and a spade can clear 3 rounds of diamonds and then 4 rounds of clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: OK any questions about the tournament feel free to ask NOW|pg||
nt|dburn: no, it is ten to one in London|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Ah yes europe is almost 02:00|pg||
nt|dburn: and I have just got back from dinner with the Hacketts, so my analysis is likely to be wrong for at least the next hour or so|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: I do not have any results from the side event they will be posted at http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=39&Itemid=50 when available|pg||
nt|dburn: I have a question - who's winning?|pg||
nt|henryb: at the other table the defense start spades but declarer immediately cashed clubs and later guessed the @h10|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Levin Weinstein by the length of the straight|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: 2588 Levin Weinstein|pg||
nt|reisig: Have we started the play..yet?|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: 1755 Gitelman Moss|pg||
nt|dburn: or possibly that should be "who's coming second?" since the answer to the first question has been Levin and Weinstein for at least the last ten years|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: One round gone Rich|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Bramley Passell 1646|pg||
nt|reisig: ahh ..thx|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Bessis x 2 1448|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Lev Pszczola 1384|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Cohler Seamon 1263|pg||
nt|henryb: so Levin Weinstein were a little below averave in the last session|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Piekarek Smirnov (cheers) 1246|pg||
nt|reisig: sooo ..the event gets closer and closer|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Not well below THEIR average|pg||
nt|henryb: they were minus about 100 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Not stop well below their average|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Seeing they noormally average around 500 a session that was a bad one|pg||
nt|henryb: they started the day over 2600|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Eisenberg Goldberg are 1036|pg||
nt|henryb: they were minus about 1000|pg||
nt|reisig: I'd NEVER count Billy out|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Those are all scores after 3 sessions or 28 of 47 rounds|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Sorry Levin Weinstein 3588 - fingeritis|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Am closing and reopening immediately|pg||
