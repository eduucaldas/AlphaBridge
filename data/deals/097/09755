nt|petergill: We will be following the leaders Levin - Weinstein for the whole of this Session. |pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|bjacobs: Declarer will be disappointed when the 9 is covered with the stiff 10|pg||
nt|petergill: normal (and unlucky) to insert @S9 here. |pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That just about puts paid to 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: Tricks are in short supply for declarer|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|petergill: Charles Wigoder owns a telco in London and plays rubber bridge there. Zia needs no introduction. |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|bjacobs: So it's fair to say that Zia will be earning a bit of money just for playing ...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petergill: Zia would have liked to be able to double 2@S for take-out, but Dbl would have been penalty in their rubber-bridge-oriented bidding system|pg||
nt|bjacobs: N/S play a method for their 2NT opening that one might describe as "the world's craziest convention"|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If you don't know, I could give you 50 guesses, and you wouldn't get it|pg||
nt|petergill: so Zia was forced into bidding 2NT to show any values, since Pass would have shown weakness|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: I know I know|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sorry, employees of the event are barred from this competition|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: only need 1 guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: oh ok|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Let's see if it comes up in the next two boards|pg||
nt|petergill: It's a mystery to me|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|bjacobs: Wait in patience ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@H transfer|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 1NT = classic Zia, although he would have lots of company on this one|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpr: seems like a routine 1nt|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, fair enough.  Not so routine 10 years ago, I guess|pg||
nt|petergill: trump lead probably turns out best|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: go into the other room and see classic Grue 1NTs for excitement|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: @D8 3rd and 5th best|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|petergill: West knows that South has @DAK10, or else East would have played @DK or @D10 at Trick 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: Zia pulls down the screen to talk to Weinstein|pg||
nt|petergill: @C10 to pin the nine is a good card to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: Satisfied with the answer he pulls it up again|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|petergill: So West can place South with @SQJ (with Qx or Qxx, Zia would have timed the play to lead towards the queen) |pg||
nt|petergill: Clever duck by Bobby Levin|pg||
nt|petergill: Ignore me|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, it's a clever duck by someone ...|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|petergill: From Zia's point of view, Levin is a passed hand with @DJ and perhaps @DQ and @CA, so unlikely to have @HA. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: It looks to me that the @HK will eventually be the 8th trick ... so Zia did very well not to waste it there|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pg||

pc|h9|nt|bjacobs: well, not quite so accurate later|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|petergill: Also, West's reluctance to ever lead hearts tended to place @HA in West's hand|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bjacobs: He went for spades 3-3|pg||

nt|bjacobs: What should South open?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|petergill: :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: of course ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2NT = 12-14 balanced|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: the system in action|pg||
nt|petergill: 12-14 balanced?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: yup|pg||
mb|3H|nt|petergill: And they are not winning?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: amazing, isn't it|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: with a bazooka like that, you would expect it to be Game Set and Match|pg||
pc|s7|nt|petergill: 3@H transfer - do both players open 2NT on 12-14 balanced or just Zia?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: both .. it's all on the system card Peter|pg||
nt|bjacobs: apparently|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|petergill: They've right -sided the spades here|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|vugraphzpr: for now|pg||
nt|petergill: but I see 4 losers even with Zia at the helm|pg||
nt|petergill: If he plays a @d next, should Eaast play @Da or |pg||
nt|petergill: @D10?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: these days with the declining pound and inflation 2NT just doesnt buy you what it used to|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|petergill: @DA and a heart through would certainly take the pressure off his partner. |pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|petergill: Bill, is their 3NT opening 10-11 balanced?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: ha ha|pg||
nt|petergill: @DA could be bad if partner has @DKJx or @DKJxx|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, the system reminds one of Alice in Wonderland|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Lewis Caroll would be proud of their approach|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|vugraphzpr: nothing is as it seems|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|petergill: and Zia is tricky enough to lead low towards nothing in the unseen hand|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Spec says that 2NT is ok - it's just like one of those weak preempts in an unidentified suit.  Except here, the suit will NEVER be identified|pg||
