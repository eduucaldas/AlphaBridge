nt|athene: well that was difficult - south really had to scream for a diamond to persuade north to lead one from his holding|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Very polite|pg||
nt|mariner1: action here maybe?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: part score battle here|pg||
nt|viren169: as expected 11 to Mossop on  9|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@H by simpson will put pressure on Tom|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: Mossop win 11 on board 9 - due to a 'heavy' 4@S overcall of 1@D in OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes we are not surprised|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|roswolf: looking at just the n/s hands slam is possible|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: 3n would make on  spade lead|pg||
nt|viren169: 2N=some sort of enq|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: 6@D isn't such a bad spot, single dummy|pg||
nt|thegarve:  he might have tried 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Robson's third preempt in a row  |pg||
nt|thegarve:  I see double is penalties|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: and indeed we see the action|pg||
nt|roswolf: -2 at least|pg||
nt|mariner1: and they are looking to score up the max|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: may put townsend off that lead tho|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: no it didnt|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: they will need 800 - 3NT easy enough|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The max is only 500 - not so great|pg||
nt|mariner1: sure you have a 7 card BROKEN suit,,, both the o's are in the auction........ 3@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: too much|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt would have scored more|pg||
nt|thegarve:  doubt that +500 would gain and I expect ALffrey to get off the schneider|pg||
nt|athene: note Robson's careful @HJ from dummy|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 6@D would score more too|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if it makes...|pg||
nt|athene: trying to confuse the issue|pg||
nt|mariner1: well could the find those spot?|pg||
nt|mariner1: they|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|asnuttyas: brave 3nt with Jxx and Txx in the minors|pg||
nt|viren169: more imps flowing towards Mossop...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: cant blame tom theoretically he xpects pard to have spades|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s8|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: this is a steal for the mossop team|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: not a good start for irenas|pg||
nt|lestergold: Irens|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The 4-0 trump split is the problem in 6@D|pg||
nt|mariner1: I guess 3N was going to be found,,,,,,,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|roswolf: mossop gained 6 on 10 where game was reached -1|pg||

nt|athene: if you reach 6@D you might well get a spade lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: now some action likely|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3N not likely to be bid and made every day on that hand|pg||
nt|athene: robson will surely just go one down in 4@H>|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably end up in 4@H?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 4@H by West - is that action?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|viren169: More light opening in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|chessmaste: Looks dull to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: opp an lobvercall 1n by south of course very constructive so north entitled to raise to 3|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: 8 tricks are easy - the 9th may prove somewhat more tricky to find|pg||
nt|viren169: @D lead still here...|pg||
nt|lestergold: Jd lead is challenging|pg||
nt|athene: i spoke too soon, sorry - @S2 goes away now|pg||
mb|3S|nt|asnuttyas: oh - there's the 9th :)|pg||
nt|viren169: if they are good enough to bid... they are good enough to lead!|pg||
nt|vugraphzqa: beer card appears|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm not good enuf this 7d lead|pg||
nt|viren169: lots of ways to get the 9th trick.|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: if he plays low from dummy that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: hej stig|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bye bye spade loser|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: Tom thinking best chance to find pard with something like a doubleton dim honour for 4d tricks and a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Even the J would not be good enough...|pg||
nt|lestergold: note how n/s wisely stayed out of no play 4s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|roswolf: very but then our appetites are easily sated|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: i think jd leads to 2 spades 2dims and a club surely|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: the J@D lead sets up 5 potential winners for E/W though|pg||
nt|viren169: not sure running the spade was wise...|pg||
nt|viren169: best to secure 3 clubs first!|pg||
nt|athene: that spade play was very strange|pg||
nt|viren169: now a @D back |pg||
nt|lestergold: why no play on clubs for 9 cold tricks|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: a big oops had been called|pg||
nt|athene: after the @D9 wins, a club guarantees 9 doesn't it?|pg||
nt|viren169: unlike Colin to do that....|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes it does|pg||
nt|athene: the defence can't even attack declarer's entry to hand whilst the clubs are blocked|pg||
nt|athene: so just two trumps and the @CA to lose|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|athene: because a heart can be won in dummy with the @HK|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mariner1: and a nother nice maker here|pg||
nt|mariner1: another|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is colin up to?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|d7|nt|viren169: nice 6 to tell pd where the entry is...|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: a senior moment perhaps|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes another good board for allfrey potentially|pg||
nt|athene: Robson has been making a lot more tricks than he ought to have (2NT, 4@S, 4@H)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mariner1: yes and they should bring in some score too|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Could easily be flat - but they might lead a club in the other room - then South has to find the switch|pg||
pc|sT|pc|hJ|pc|s8|pg||
pc|cA|nt|viren169: and the 9 just in case pd missed it 1st time!|pg||
nt|lestergold: colin 's greatest strength is his card play im amazed at this|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 5@C 2 down - 5@S made - we will see what happen|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mariner1: http://tinyurl.com/pql8rl  -  Convention Cards  look here too|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|snorris: 3nt likly n-s|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: i grabbed their CC from when they represented South Africa in Beijing Senior event|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|snorris: or maybe 4 @ss|pg||
nt|snorris: if north bids 3 @ss now |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Apteker-Gower  2/1, 15-17  and even 2@D = natural, weak|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@S or 3N here|pg||
nt|newmoon: Gower/Apteker = udca   |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: @H lead to hold to 4|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 3@C can bid 3Nt with half stop|pg||
nt|snorris: this is better then 3 nt ..think 3nt can be beaten|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the Q in @S is a great card however|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3NT also +1.   there are 2 @H-stoppers if they play|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S need @S 3/3 or T second|pg||
pc|h6|nt|snorris: ah ..sure clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if K in @H out finesse|pg||
nt|mariner1: and there it is|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very difficult to realize that South's major suit honors are perfect for NT though|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however with double control in @H 3Nt it is impossible to go down |pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|bridge_one: instead 4@S need to lose only one @S|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and North's 3@H instead of 3@S isn't repeat ask for help in @H - it would be natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if 3N easier to find if South does not open|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably not|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S by north is ok, must give 6 cards - South could choise 3Nt with half stopper, bec with a stop south would bid 2Nt|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|newmoon: bd 13:  ladies took the save in 5@Cx.  Would have been a gain if OR bid the game|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c2|nt|bridge_one: i suppose they play 1@D 1@S, 2@C 3@S limit, true ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: now there is a possible @S promotion|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||

nt|ahollan1: that doesn't look right to me -- IF @D at trick 2, then contract should be -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: agree|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|snorris: the @d play looked strange|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: @D play looked wrong -- accepting the claim looked strange :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: 4@S can be made by West, not East.   @D-lead from South lethal|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: Gower choise a safe pass|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: 8 loser hand - pass looks right    however, swap East's minors then game try|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|newmoon: OR in 3@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: sufficient find 4@s and 4@C with the same card to a reasonable 4@S|pg||

nt|newmoon: by West|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N EW is the spot|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @s is probably -4|pg||
mb|3S|an|SPLINTER|nt|snorris: with @c lead (natural)|pg||
mb|d|nt|bridge_one: 6@C was made with @C 3/2, @D 3/2 and K in @C in finesse|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@S splinter should warn S and it does|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Bloom-Holroyd have represented South Africa internationally in both Women's and Senior events|pg||

nt|ahollan1: normal lead is one of the Aces|pg||
nt|mariner1: they would have to hold up on a @H lead|pg||

nt|mariner1: NS should win it in @S however you never know|pg||
nt|snorris: with right guess in @cs|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 3@H, 3@S, 4@S all seem to have merit|pg||
nt|mariner1: N should just bid 2@S everyone in auction and VUL vs NV|pg||
mb|3H|nt|snorris: well.. does south have extra?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe   i didn't even think about 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: he could be worse..|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mariner1: free bidding VUL vs NV shows cards :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: if @CQ is @DQ then 4@S automatic -- here - any approach reasonable|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @ss is lucky, with the ace of @ds right|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@H is correct - bec give the hand perfectly - without sgl in @H would bid Dbl, not 3@H|pg||
nt|snorris: agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or some science where North can say she has @S and @D|pg||
nt|snorris: 1 @s bid could be lead directing bid|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
