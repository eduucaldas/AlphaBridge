nt|lestergold: wow|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: What a fun hand|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4NT opening is best with the North hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: good hand for 4NT opening |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Specific Ace Asking|pg||
nt|yuval10: asking for specific aces|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And partner has two aces, but not the right one|pg||
mb|1C!|an|17+|nt|lestergold: north has an old fashioned 4n opener if people still play that|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Old fashioned?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|hedyg: 1NT is a good option with the N hand|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|lestergold: well i play it so it must be|pg||
mb|3S|nt|petergill: 2@H Dbl 3@H or 2@H Passl 3@H is not an invitation, the opener is expected, or even demanded, not to bid again|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Passing the East hand is losing bridge|pg||
nt|daman: no kidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: bad @H suit and get the strength across|pg||
nt|roswolf: the elephants in the other room survived with a plus score at least|pg||
nt|hedyg: amazing pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is even worse|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|hedyg: and now punish pd for balancing|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: it was gtailor made for this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: I think 4NT as specific aces isn't old fashioned... and I play it, and it's come up... believe it or not.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|yuval10: 4@d now|pg||
nt|lestergold: of clourse it does|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: A bit strong for a 15-17 1NT|pg||
nt|petergill: with all those tens|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree but north in the other room took a pessimistic view|pg||
nt|daman: what dpoes South need to double this one?|pg||
nt|daman: a drink maybe|pg||
mb|4H|nt|petergill: Hence the upgrade to 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|hedyg: now a @c lead..|pg||
nt|hedyg: she is happy with the contract|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Not a very good start for NS in the CR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Helin did what you should never do: raised partner's jump to 6@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|Walddk2: Granath will be sleeping on the sofa in the living room tonight, says his girlfriend :)|pg||
nt|daman: and what contract would she not be happy with?|pg||
nt|hedyg: they better cash the @C trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: now@CQ|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If he had been interested in your two aces, he would have asked|pg||
nt|lestergold: still north has many ways of forcing partner to cue the ace of clubs and south didnt so ...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: ok, good stop|pg||
nt|yuval10: and 14 imps|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Must be disappointing for North, but it's a nice auction and a good stop|pg||
nt|lestergold: sounds like a bridge cime was committed in the closed|pg||
pc|sJ|mc|12|nt|lestergold: i mean  i know certain players who would open s with north and another few who would think that they should bid 7 with two aces opposite|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: ahhhh Klinger has switched partners!   earlier sets with Matt Mullamphy|pg||
pc|c6|nt|nigel: Fun stuff Klinger and Lilley were once Australia's premier pair..So bragging rights whoever wins|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so, maybe the answer tothe questions about who has the most partners is Klinger|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|nigel: Klinger Hoffman play in the Seniors, Klinger Mullamphy play open|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|tejjyid: well, thisis certainly a Seniors table now|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|nigel: Correct....very much so|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: If partner cared about your aces, he would have asked|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1D!|an|4+ H|nt|roswolf: or even slightly better than that|pg||
nt|hedyg: even!|pg||
nt|petergill: Vulnerable games at IMPS should be about 35% chance to be worth bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H!|an|11-14NT 2-3c H|nt|hedyg: i thought 40%|pg||
nt|lestergold: Adam you are right o course you are but players often go wrong with these hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: OK|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS have a lot of experience already in playing national and international competitions|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i will try 35%..|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 1@h promises 3@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think South has a X here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2h high enuf on these cards|pg||
nt|lestergold: vulnerable south cant safely back into this|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm not a good double but hard to pass even if not a junior|pg||
nt|hedyg: i trust you Peter|pg||
nt|petergill: @D7 or @Dq back as suit pref to show @HK?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hed like to double |pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: sorry specs; we don't have E-W's CC, so we can't tell what 1@S is|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: restrained 3@s bid|pg||
nt|petergill: even at the expense of wasting the Beer Card|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: nor 1@c..|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok lets guess, strong @c, 1@s 8+ with @hs, 2@c checkback, 3NT= i was not interested in your 4 @ss..|pg||
nt|daman: all roads led to 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: at unfavourable i think risk outweighs gain with tah hand|pg||
pc|hK|pc|cT|pc|h6|nt|roswolf: yes very disciplined but prudent since north was under pressure and ,as here,may have to stretch to find a bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: do EW have a chance at 4@H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i guess not on a @c lead|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|daman: there are 4 losers unless NS fail to cash their @Ds|pg||
nt|lestergold: at mps i agree|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c4|pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|petergill: South might have played @D10 at Trick 1 to disguise the @d position, but East has played W for @DK109 anyway|pg||
nt|hedyg: she needs to play @s from dummy to get rid of the @c losers|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not much else Sj√∂berg can play when in with @SJ|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|hedyg: that would be 2@d and 1@s loser only|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hedyg: J@C?|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|nt|hedyg: could try that before @c|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: Not really|pg||
nt|daman: then declarer can pitch 2@Cs on the @Ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: would be for free|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|petergill: since partner (West) had natural trump tricks, missing the ruff did not cost|pg||
nt|daman: and wuldn't have to lose a @C|pg||

mb|1N!|nt|nigel: How times have changed what a dreadful opening!|pg||
mb|2H!|an|!S or !C+!D|nt|nigel: regardless of the outcome|pg||
nt|rodal f: But was worce. Lilly had a lead at 58 by the best. Last session was a 3 in for Lilly after Del Montte was 10 behind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my opinion - Lilley team has been steadier -- actually picking up many imps for staying low / being less active in competition|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel: Some would call that just sound good bridge|pg||
mb|2S|an|must bid|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: yep - they have plyed old fashioned bridge & been rewarded for it|pg||
mb|3C|an|!C+!D|nt|tejjyid: it doesn't have to be good, it just has to be better|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: reminds me of my days as paramedic  ---  First, Do No Harm|pg||

pc|cA|pg||

nt|nigel: LOL|pg||

mb|1H|nt|petergill: Bd 2: I think North having @H7 might stop 4@h by EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hm another mistake in the closed slam off two tops|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: straightforward hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|daman: 2@C might be modified capp?|pg||
nt|daman: either @Ds  or a major/minor 2 suiter? |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Cappelletti over partner's 1NT?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yuck. looking for slam after partner couldn't cuebid @c...|pg||
nt|lestergold: these slam level errors are very expensive|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|lestergold: slam exploration is legitimate here but the club hole should easily be identified|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: mod capp rescue over the double|pg||
nt|daman: I play that with weak NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: we talked earlier about not asking RKCB with a void, now we can see why asking RKCB with 2 quick losers in a suit is wrong, too|pg||
mb|4H|nt|yuval10: that's why they invented cue-bids|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: exactly, especially when partner had the chance to cuebid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: now North shouldn't even explore|pg||
mb|5D|nt|petergill: Bd 2 in 4@H: Three rounds of clubs to stop the @d's being set up in time, then declarer tries to crossruff, but I think 4@H fails. |pg||
nt|daman: 2@C would be modified capp|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't know that Mike Cappelletti would allow his name to be used in that context|pg||
nt|daman: he does|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2NT jacoby with 3 cards?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@S=8-11, 5+@S no shortage|pg||
mb|2D|nt|tejjyid: enjoy Nigel|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Nigel would never miss his weekly proctologist's appointment|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: does that mean a different proctologist each week?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I might rather X 2@S than bid 3H on an untextured 5 card suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- i couldn't stop myself from sending that|pg||
nt|tejjyid: :)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|rodal f: If Ron bid now there are no sakrifice. But got it anyway|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: right Andrew - especially when Nagy is known to hold 2/3@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: In Swedish Jacoby, responder can also shows his own singleton over 3@C if he prefers, which is useful with hands too strong to splinter|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|hedyg: so more flexible in your opinion|pg||
nt|hedyg: no 1@s bid by N|pg||
nt|petergill: And Swedish Jacoby, sometimes called Stenberg I think, allows 2NT on suitable hands with 3 card support too. |pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: no undo|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol ok Johnny|pg||
nt|hedyg: we believe you!|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|daman: and only over a weak NT opening   not over a strong NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: needs to drop Qx@h offside|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm perhaps an underbid from west but certainly an overbid gtom east|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 2sp was 6c and 9-11hp|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Solution: Drop a card on the floor, and get a good look|pg||
nt|lestergold: wont succeed unless neck very long|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzqy: it was 2h by south|pg||
nt|petergill: A trusting 3@H call, trusting partner to have a good suit to enter the auction vulnerable at the 2-level|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: yes bt is the hand he expected|pg||
nt|hedyg: she could have bid double instead of 3@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: but|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is that a cue bid?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think W is worth a 4@c bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: for me yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think it should be, Bill|pg||
nt|daman: 4@C has to be a cue I would think|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So you don't get dealt xx-xx-xx-KQJxxxx|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Sometimes yes, but then I must bid 3@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: i bid 3@s over 3@H with that|pg||
nt|daman: I wouldn't bid 4@C with that|pg||
nt|bjacobs: nice|pg||
nt|henryb: and what would you bid with x xx Qx KJ109xxxx?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|lestergold: north then too strong for 2s in thie system|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|hedyg: when pd shows 2 suits why bother him with mine?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: West's 3@H showed Values probably|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: I would be feeling sick and leave the room, Henry|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|yuval10: ok, then after winning K@s, declarer should play K@c|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yuval10: or @c to the K now|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|lestergold: in that case east may have the bid|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|petergill: Pretty normal to bid to 4@H, just unlucky that there are 4 losers - that's my opinion|pg||
pc|h5|nt|daman: Meck would bid a confident 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, I would have pre-empted in clubs long time ago|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I happen to think that 4@C should be natural|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it has the disadvatage that the defense can find the @d ruff|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, it's a calculated risk|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|d9|pc|d7|pg||
pc|hT|mc|9|nt|Walddk2: For newcomers. 'Myra' in Swedish means 'ant', so 'One ant and three elephants'. The ant is Irma Petersen for sure. She's a head shorter than her teammates :)|pg||

mb|2C|nt|bjacobs: But it's a deep position to say: "4@C is natural if not a passed hand, cue otherwise"|pg||
nt|henryb: indeed. as a passed hand the cue bid interpretation makes sense|pg||
nt|hedyg: what a lucky slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: anybody know what 1@H shows?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not that bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is 1@H 8+ balanced?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pity we don't have the CCs|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|petergill: The next World Junior Pairs is in Turkey in August - don't miss it if you're under 25|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 8+ denying a 5-card major and 6-card minor|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 5@D looks a very good result in the other room|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In the CR, N/S established a missing key card and missing spade queen ... the joys of RKCB|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: mind you, 6@h is less than 50%, so you do not want to be there|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hedyg: i am trying to guess how they made 5@d..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, maybe it's too good for me|pg||
nt|henryb: Okay; I do not want to be there. It requires guessing spades and favorable breaks in both majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess Henry means 6@S. Not even I would want to be in 6@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|daman: and that is saying something|pg||
nt|henryb: no; I meant 6@h on the previous hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh that one|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yesterday's news|pg||
nt|daman: Roland would always be in 6@H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But strangely, the <50% applies here as well.  Maybe it's around 40%|pg||
nt|daman: needs 5 of 6 things to be right|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s unlikely to make but 3c makes cards lie very badly for n/s|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@s has a play|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: ok, 1@c 17+ any, 1@H= 8+balanced or unbalanced with 5-4 minors|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||

pc|d6|nt|hedyg: played*|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C is better than 6@S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One of these blind luck swings|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: now you can run the @s to the  on the way back.|pg||
nt|yuval10: @s to K, @d to Q, and @d ruff|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: 2@H looks easier certainly |pg||
nt|petergill: I think cashing @Ca could have been left until later|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3 tricks easier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/WomensTeams/Sweden/rimstedt-sjoberg.pdf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks to Carina Westlin|pg||
nt|bjacobs: She might run this lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If it works, she has 12 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although she doesn't have to on this spade layout|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If it fails, she looks to be finished|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C by South is the best slam if you want to be in slam that is|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|nt|lestergold: i cant see how declarer can avoid the loss of 2c 2s and 2 hearts|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: -1 now|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|hedyg: open "movie" and click the other table to see the play|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: small trump return makes this -2 now|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course with the club avalanche in no trumps 2s a better spot than 1N|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|petergill: His aim is to make at least 8 tricks in 2@H, so possble spade overruffs could be afforded, |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Quite a tough psychological decision ... in theory, running the lead was the percentage play ... but how likely was the lead to be from the king?|pg||
nt|hedyg: thinking to finesse H10x in @S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's an ugly card - it means that she is going to have to play the second spade whilst a trump is outstanding|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's making the all-or-nothing finesse at trick 1 look better and better|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hedyg: would you assume opp led from K@H vs slam?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Depends on the opp, I guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Against someone rating themselves "world class" on BBO, I would bet they DON'T have the king|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But someone rating themselves "Advanced" - play him for the king|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: unlucky hand, but probably -3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|nt|yuval10: might be -3 now|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: since he will lead a @H to the Queen...|pg||
nt|po-s: silly H discard|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petergill: Trump control is an issue for declarer now, due to @Ca being cashed early|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My theory is that World Class players don't know what they are doing|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, she could not go wrong|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|cT|nt|roswolf: declarer in control|pg||
nt|hedyg: he will make his 2 trumps|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|nt|petergill: Trump control is a tricky aspect of card play to understand fully, but all the world's very best players have a good grasp of it|pg||

nt|hedyg: and still beforcing|pg||
nt|petergill: Personally I like Strong Jump Shifts much more than the in-vogue weak jump shifts responses|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: she would have bid 1@s with 4 4 Ms as well|pg||
nt|yuval10: i don't really understand why bid 1NT here|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: North should trap pass|pg||
nt|yuval10: from N|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hm they care all getting their toes wet here|pg||

pc|c2|nt|lestergold: but same finish|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: the punt rather spoiled things - 3! would have allowed south to show his handH|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tough for Lindstr√∂m without a spade control|pg||
nt|hedyg: how about 3@s by N denying control in minors?|pg||
nt|petergill: South likes her controls, but is minimum|pg||

nt|hedyg: definitely 10000% better|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: North needs to pass hoping partner will reopen with a double|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: now he can kill his vulnerable opponents|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|d4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: or as u say pass the reopening double if it comes|pg||

nt|jaheim: .|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|petergill: Yes Hedy, that is a possible way to bid it, if that's your agreement. Probably not their agreement here, or else she could have bid it|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: what I would like to do is penalize 2@c or 2@s or wherever they run|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hedyg: hmm|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: she probably thought 2@H had shown her hand already|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pg||

mb|1N|mb|d|mb|2D|nt|petergill: South has a lot of catching up to do, to show her hand|pg||
nt|pocken: With a standard treatment of a 2H jump shift, 1C!  - 1H! - 1NT - 3Sp! would do the trick|pg||
nt|yuval10: and N keeps bidding NT...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@C is a bit conservative|pg||

mb|4S|nt|mtvesuvius: this 1NT is just as bad as the last one...|pg||

mb|3C|nt|daman: Roland has seen a third generation of trees|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Because this gives them exposure to many common tactical situations|pg||
mb|3S|nt|roswolf: true but there are hands that qualify and therefore i try to cater for them|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: nice slam here, but it must be played in @c|pg||

mb|5C|nt|bjacobs: Whereas playing obscure big club methods, you lose that experience|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s now?|pg||

nt|lestergold: 6c for e/w with a 6s good save available|pg||

nt|lestergold: east must surely bid 4s over 3s!|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: otherwise it's not a very good slam to be in|pg||
nt|lestergold: or heart finesse also|pg||
mb|6C|mb|d|nt|yuval10: 4@s is better because it can also create a force and help the partnership in this particular situation when opps bid 5@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|pocken: sorry answered E-W age, N is even younger, and played for a looong time, so sure she tried natural system|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|yuval10: this hand implicate the advatages of a strong @c opening over the natural system... whereas in most of the natural systems it would go 1@c - 1@h - 2NT - P |pg||
