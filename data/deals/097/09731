nt|roswolf: nice result in the other room|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|athene: south owes her partner a heart, here, surely?|pg||
nt|roswolf: north opened1@D INTHE OTHER ROOM|pg||
nt|sheila a: As S you'd prefer to be able to raise @c straight away, wouldn't you?|pg||
nt|roswolf: definitely sheila|pg||
nt|athene: yes, in traditional P.C. surely 1@D is unbalanced, 5+@D or 4-4-4-1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C should in theory be 12-14 balanced if not the strong with clubs or any 18+|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Its find the lady time in 5@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Zmuda treated her hand as balanced I guess|pg||
nt|athene: south might try 3@S or 4@C now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not unreasonably with @SQ stiff|pg||
nt|athene: or even 3NT|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|sheila a: Or why mess around? :)|pg||
nt|athene: well, 5@C is fine unless partner can have @Cxx for this auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: but south knows that her partner can't really have spade length, so has to have some clubs|pg||
nt|sheila a: what you said|pg||
nt|sheila a: Typed it quicker!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh, that reminds me. I always meant to ask people from English speaking countries what the difference is between messing *around* and messing *about*. Now I have the chance. So ...|pg||

nt|sheila a: I have no idea, sorry.|pg||
nt|athene: they are pretty much interchangeable Roland|pg||
nt|athene: messing about is more common i would say|pg||
nt|thegarve:  around is plural about singular|pg||
nt|roswolf: messing about = a bit more critical eg more juvenile|pg||
nt|Walddk2: if you mess someone around, you are causing them inconvenience. When you mess about, you cause yourself inconvenience, says Mike Graham. He has a point|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|thegarve:  your mum would use messing about to you as a kid in a high pitch voice|pg||

nt|sheila a: We have a number of good Scottish terms which are also interchangeble: to footer, to faff about and to guddle|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes the subtle changes in word expressions are sometimes too subtle for the English!:)|pg||

mb|1H|nt|roswolf: not really martin the victorian maestro's|pg||
nt|athene: 1870's crooners|pg||
mb|2H|nt|thegarve:  Michaels 2H for the brave|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: and juniors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fearless|pg||
nt|sheila a: E tried to have a piece of 3@s in the other room|pg||
nt|thegarve:  oh yes, the famous one Jeffrey|pg||
nt|athene: well, you can be brave with a 2@H michaels bid as you get to play the 2-level a lot|pg||
nt|athene: a michaels 2@S bid is a bit more dodgy|pg||
mb|3S|nt|roswolf: yes i insist on 5/5 or better otherwise -2300 is a possibility|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  should have tried a chop - just in case|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: yes, doubling 3@S doesn't look as though it can really cost|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes this is one area when good players go for a burton|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: a spec points out that perhaps east hoped she would get a chance to X 4@S|pg||
nt|thegarve:  now there's a phrase that the masses won't know the derivation- going for a burton|pg||
nt|athene: but opps are missing a lot of keycards to be contemplating 4@S at these colours|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|roswolf: a lot i agree|pg||
nt|athene: in my reference book of interesting phrases, it's down that there are several possible explanations but it's not sure which is right|pg||
nt|athene: one is that a "burton" was a drink|pg||
nt|roswolf: fine ale indeed|pg||
nt|athene: and they just said "oh, he's gone for a burton" as a euphemism|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Steve Burton plays maybe we should ask if he has gone for 2300|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: if you haven't gone for 2300 at some point, you don't bid enough :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|sheila a: It might have been better to draw trumps before trying the @c|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|thegarve:  2-1 fits at six-level|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes that is what my pard and i agreed after it happened|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|roswolf: and it was at the 5 level only:(|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: best was to cash two diamonds ending in north and then the club through|pg||
nt|roswolf: and yes defence mis-defended:(:(|pg||
nt|sheila a: I wonder why S played the Q@d?|pg||
nt|athene: but this still gives declarer a problem|pg||
nt|athene: you might want to try ruffing high with the idea of throwing @D7 on the established @C10 later|pg||
nt|thegarve:  its when they bark at each other after collecting 2300 not 2600 that you know the match is yours for the taking|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|sheila a: I can see going for 2300 happens to you a lot, Martin|pg||
nt|roswolf: occupational hazard|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is very tricky for declarer|pg||
nt|thegarve:  sounds like 13 out I said to my table when Iain and Derek were having animated convesation next door|pg||
nt|athene: @HA, heart to @HK, @C10 pitching @D7 is a possible line|pg||
nt|thegarve:  the next one I estimated as only 6 IMPs as it was not in such shrill|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s3|pc|c9|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|thegarve:  both accurate|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: but if the defence had cashed both diamonds before putting small club through, declarer would have had to take a view about the @HQ|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
mc|10|nt|roswolf: nicely calulated by declarer|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||

nt|vugraphzps: I dont blame him but partner has to have good cards somewhere|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: Game is no picnic but it happens to roll with an overtrick|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: could easily be off with trumps 4-1|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|bobh1: well maybe S with an absolute max for 2@S should bid it|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s3|nt|bobh1: 3@d must be some manner of game try|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: xxxx in @ds is a terrible holding|pg||
nt|bobh1: xxx would be worse|pg||
nt|vugraphzps: true|pg||
nt|bobh1: when partner makes a game try you look at your holding in his try suit only if borderline|pg||

nt|vugraphzrh: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|thegarve:  a renigade pair?|pg||
nt|athene: Polish players are pretty scary in play and defence in my experience - at the risk of getting shouted at by 100 spectators, it's only their bidding that has stopped them winning ...|pg||
nt|athene: lots of Bermuda Bowls already|pg||
nt|thegarve:  not play WJxx (fill in the xx as a number)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this looks easy to deal with as e/w but this couls easily be a banana skin|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H|nt|sheila a: Same 2@c opening in the other room, but N/S weren't punished. |pg||
nt|sheila a: I wonder how 2@h would go?|pg||
nt|roswolf: the chopping board awaits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It will only cost a fortune|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Martin's 2300|pg||
nt|roswolf: t/o dbl is possible by east|pg||
nt|thegarve:  unable to play trumps 2H makes plenty|pg||
nt|sheila a: E may well just bid a number of @s|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: planning to bid lots of spades later of course|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: there's no way that east will defend 2@H with that hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: especially at these colours|pg||
nt|thegarve:  might even make six tricks|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: she has - you only learn the flexibility of a double in later years perhaps?|pg||
nt|athene: yes - if you imagine the play in 2@HX, you see why people don't like to double for t/o at low levels with a void|pg||
nt|athene: when partner is sure to leave it in|pg||
nt|thegarve:  I do not advocate a t/o double on a void at all|pg||
nt|athene: it makes a lot of difference if you can lead a trump through|pg||
nt|athene: and stop a ruff or two in dummy|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|athene: as well as saving partner from getting trump-endplayed, a lot of the time|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|thegarve:  4-1 @h break = 4 off 5-0 @h break = 2 off|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||

nt|sheila a: What's wrong with defending 1NT if it goes off?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with defending 1NT is that even if you ought to beat it, you don't have a clue what declarer has got, and you let it make 120|pg||
nt|thegarve:  You should have... no you should have dfended by.....|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: i admit that there is less reason to balance super-aggressively if you have a balanced hand|pg||

nt|athene: hi good morning everyone|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|athene: of course 2@C is the normal bid with north - but i quite expected to see 1NT raptor (showing 4 spades and a longer minor) - that is popular with many top Polish players|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The winning team along with the Ewa Grabowska - Natalia Sakowska will represent Poland at the European Youth Team Championships in the Under-26 Girls series in Romania in July|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||

nt|athene: if you are going to play a 4-3 fit you really want the 3-card trump holding to be taking the ruffs|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: even with trumps 3-3, you aren't too happy on @HAKQ|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|hJ|pc|cT|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|athene: @CKQ pitching @HJ8 and suddenly it IS the 3-card trump holding taking the heart ruffs :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: when a defender sees the potential for ruffs in dummy it's natural to lead a trump|pg||
nt|athene: but here, i think Weinhold should have seen that continuing hearts was really going to kill declarer|pg||
nt|athene: Zmuda would certainly have rebid 3@S if she had five|pg||
nt|athene: even if she had started with 2@C in the first place (unlikely)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: so she is only in a 4-3 fit and the force was going to be deadly|pg||

pc|d3|pc|s6|nt|athene: this is quite a cute ending|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: it's an example of the "tempo or elopement dilemma" for the defence|pg||
nt|athene: if east tries to draw north's small trump, north just wins @SK and leads the @C8|pg||
nt|athene: if east forces north|pg||

mb|d|mb|3S|nt|Walddk3: Poland and the Netherlands have so many juniors to choose from|pg||

nt|athene: i don't have any system cards for these pairs - i tend to assume Polish Club because that seems to be overwhelmingly popular there|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  a little embarassing to let that last 4@S home|pg||
nt|athene: if 1@C really is Polish then (weak NT or very strong) then south has a problem now because 4@C sounds a bit forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Yes, must be forcing after South's double|pg||
nt|Walddk3: If she had passed, it would not have been|pg||
nt|thegarve:  the weakness of Polish @c here - South is in doubt after the 4@C call|pg||
nt|athene: if it's forcing, you try 4@D surely? then partner can bid 4@H and back into the 5-3|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: when you are in a complex 'choice of trump suit' auction, making the cheapest bid is often best - hence 4@D|pg||
pc|s7|nt|thegarve:  West might have doubled 4D and then avoided the @s lead|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||

nt|athene: when you stay at the 2-level with 5-4 fit and make it on the nose, that can't be bad|pg||
nt|sheila a: The kind of board on which going plus is all that counts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 20 is the last board without comparison|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|athene: we were assuming Polish Club but without certainty |pg||
nt|sheila a: Nice hand for East|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  I think we have the weather covered up and down the UK - Sheila up in Edinburgh, Bll in the Midlands, I'm in Wimbledon and Geoffrey is down South|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: What about me? I'm East|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sun shining brightly here|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|athene: 2@D rebid by opener would be artificial in the Polish Club i know|pg||
nt|thegarve:  your omniprescient|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it is bright here in Brighton should be a sunny day|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: showing a strong hand (artificial) with 3-card heart support|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sheila a: sunny spells in Edinburgh, a bit breezy|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: club support you mean?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 6NT by West is where you want to be, is it not?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes looks a good contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: but there are a few hurdles to overcome - like actually bidding the slam|pg||
nt|thegarve:  when you say looks - you eman happens to come home with North endplay in @c|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|athene: well, i don't think east will stay out of slam after hearing 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think 6NT is that good is it|pg||
nt|thegarve:  6@d maybe will be bid|pg||
nt|athene: you need to use both minors to get the tricks |pg||
mb|5N|nt|sheila a: 6@c also happens to come home, and they might bid that|pg||
nt|roswolf: martin you are on form today|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 6@C better perhaps as you can ruff diamonds in dummy|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|athene: then you might make even on 4-2 diamonds if you are forcing someone to ruff with their natural trump trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: fair point|pg||
nt|thegarve:  very hard to diagnose AK@h having denied three-card @H support|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No matter what, as the cards lie you can't go wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this will be a fair test of declarer's cardplay|pg||
nt|athene: if 5NT was pick-a-slam then maybe that suggests the heart holding|pg||
nt|thegarve:  these slam contracts often depend on the impletion in suits|pg||
nt|athene: but more commonly that will just be used to suggest 6@C/6@D/6NT|pg||
nt|thegarve:  suddenly a random 10 becomes  a big card|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sheila a: 5NT pick a slam is even more ambiguous than the 2NT scramble we discussed earlier|pg||
nt|roswolf: great lead from the south hand |pg||
nt|roswolf: it might have put declarer to a nasty guess on another layout|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 5NT nowadays is the pick-a-slam thingy. 10 years ago it was a grand slam try|pg||
nt|athene: i am predicting @SA, @DAK, @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But you need a partnership agreement as in all walks of life|pg||
nt|thegarve:  5NT is a very useful convention epecially in auctions where you are wandering around|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|sheila a: I remember vividly my partner employing it in an auction where I thought we'd agreed one suit; she didn't|pg||
pc|dK|nt|thegarve:  strong 5-2 fits are better than many 8-card fits with holes|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mind you, on some auctions 5NT is still a grand slam try|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the less science you have - the more you need pard to make the last(hopefully good) decision|pg||
nt|athene: interesting!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Like when you have discovered that you have all keycards and the trump queen. Then 5NT is usually specific king ask|pg||
nt|athene: north really did that?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  can bid 5NT then 6NT as a grand slam try, comparing that to a jump to 6NT|pg||
nt|athene: ah yes of course they are equals|pg||
nt|sheila a: Trying to frighten declarer against ruffing|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Its also a brilliant transfer blame convention|pg||
nt|athene: also, if declarer had the @D7, there would be a ruffing finesse|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed a no-cost play|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: let's swap the @D7 and @D3|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Declarer should not be intimidated, for two reasons|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer might run the @D7|pg||
nt|roswolf: she wasnt|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
nt|roswolf: claim|pg||
mc|12|nt|Walddk2: 1. It may be a falsecard - 2. Even if it is not, the ruff will likely (hopefully) be from length|pg||
nt|athene: if south had three clubs and two diamonds, the contract would still make|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice hand for e/w|pg||
nt|athene: if she ruffs high ahead of dummy, you can draw trumps and ruff another diamond|pg||
nt|athene: so i think that was well bid, well defended and well played|pg||
