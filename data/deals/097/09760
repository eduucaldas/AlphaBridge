mb|1S|nt|petergill: Back to the bridge.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I am not a huge fan of showing balanced hands this way but who am I to argue with the methods of H&H|pg||
nt|petergill: Now, 2@H or more?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sT|nt|vugraphzpt: Should make 2 here losing 1 spade ruff one heart and thre minor tricks|pg||

nt|petergill: score or misclaim. Rather than pursuse the issue in thet huge prizemoney event, he let the matter pass, as not being the proper way to play the game, he did not want to try to win ...|pg||
nt|petergill: other than at the bridge table. The team that eliminated them went on to win the event. |pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: They did not let people know about this, not wanting to undermine anything. I sat at Norway's table at the Victory Dinner, hence my inside knowledge. I admired the Norwegians' good ...|pg||
nt|petergill: attitude. |pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: So this looks like losing 1-0-3-1 against a making 2 spades|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D looks like a reasonable but doomed contract. |pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I have a very soft spot for the Norwegian players, their attitude to the game, their attitude to partner etc.|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry about my diversion from the bridge. |pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Basically revolves  around the @DJ location|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I have played on a team with Erichsen and Brogeland a few times and better team mates you wil not find|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: And better dinner company than bridge players as well|pg||
nt|petergill: I agree with David - the Norwegian players are regarded highly for their sportsmannship by virtually everyone.|pg||
