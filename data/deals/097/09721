mb|1S|mb|d|nt|bjacobs: Eric Kokish would approve ... |pg||
nt|lc: I suppose N is too good (and wrong hand) for 2N, and 2@C is awkward with minors, so...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Could somebody explain the meaning of Moss's double|pg||
nt|lc: "Extremely aggressive"|pg||
mb|r|nt|vugraphzpt: Um a bettter explanation|pg||
nt|lc: But, Takeout.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He has the other two suits David ... :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I just got it - his turn to bid|pg||
nt|lc: Vul with an ugly 11 -- just not me.|pg||
nt|lc: Most of field plays SUPP XX -- but apparently not this pair.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Not me either unless a crazy person has a gun at my head and it is loaded|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Fortunately for Moss, East has 4 cards in one of his suits -- otherwise this could be 1,400 country.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: So, the normal countract is reached, and it will be easy with the @D sitting so well.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: When Brad did this 10 years ago they put it down to youth but surely that excuse disappears after some time|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Picking cards wont be hard after this auction|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lc: He's a father now -- should be more responsible  :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now they put it down to age?  "He's gone senile ..."|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lc: Well, actually, I wouldn't guess the takeout doubler has Q10x in @D.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, the @h2 certainly promises a honor|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: He can afford to lose 1-2-1-0|pg||
nt|ritong: then, west has to hold the rest of the big cards|pg||
nt|lc: Because of the T.O. X, declarer can easily envision the @D as  x with West and Q10xx with East.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not much you can do about that, but I think his entry will be used at some stage to take the CLUB finesse|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|bjacobs: Is there any way of erasing comments?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: f6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh good - can everyone hit F6 please|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lc: N-S were small + this afternoon.  The pairs we saw the previous 2 rounds were at the bottom.|pg||

pc|d9|pc|s4|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lc: South, Roger Lord -- from St. Louis area is prob not well -known -- very steady player for many many years.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c3|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|lc: I googled wojciech Kurkowski to try to tell you more, but I think I need to brush up on my Polish.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Took the first 9 tricks ... way to go .. .|pg||
mc|9|pg||
qx|o14|st||md|4SQ9HKQJ95DJT4CT85,SJT7542HDK52CKJ94,SAK86HAT876DA93CA,S3H432DQ876CQ7632|sv|o|nt|bjacobs: Fred's last 3 hands have averaged 2 points ... sound familiar?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Oh the F6 clear comments - they are still in your chat log|pg||
nt|lc: Some Souths open 2@H with this.  Not me -- not in 2nd seat.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: since he s still waiting for his first bad board, i don t think he cares|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|lc: But, apparently Roger.|pg||
nt|lc: Amusing for North, now.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Next up here we have Hussein/Sadek from Egypt|pg||
nt|lc: Surely I'd drive to 6@H -- just a question of 7.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is like the famous Bergen Cohen hand where Larry passed on a hand similar to North's |pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I would be happy to punt 6@H here and now on NOrth hand|pg||
nt|ritong: wot?|pg||
nt|lc: 7 is very close to making -- If West had both @D honors, for example he'd be squeezed.|pg||
nt|lc: Well, Bill - that is a bit of an exageration.|pg||
nt|lc: Even opposite a Bergen weak 2, I'd get to at least game in @H :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It was a 20 count, no?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: admittedly, not such a good fit|pg||
nt|lc: It was Axx in spades and a 19-count opp a weak 2@S.|pg||
nt|ritong: heh|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And of course, the famous kicker ... 2@S was balanced, and LC doubled it for, what, 1400?|pg||
nt|lc: It will be in "My Favorite 52" --  comes out next month (sorry for the plug!)  :)|pg||
nt|lc: 1,100 -- but you have a great memory -- it was in 1985, I believe --|pg||
nt|lc: Against Stansby-Martel.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Anyway, back here -- I suppose North had no scientific way to reach 7, so he did the practical thing.|pg||
nt|lc: So, this will go very quickly -- as the overtrick is not worth spending much time on.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lc: And, on that lead, 13 tricks are soon to be claimed.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: A spade lead makes 7|pg||
nt|ritong: well his pard didn t cue anything|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: They bod and made 7 at the other VG BBO Table|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|lc: On a @S lead?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well bod!|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Six not 7 sorry|pg||
nt|lc: Without a @S lead, I don't think it makes 7.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s5|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s2|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
mc|13|nt|lc: There is really no reason to play this out.  You can show your hand.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: BAck soon I need a break|pg||
nt|ritong: after the 15:)|pg||

qx|o15|st||md|1SAQ83HA2DAKQ986C2,S74H985DT73CQT843,SKJT95HQJ64DJ4C65,S62HKT73D52CAKJ97|sv|n|nt|lc: It is hard work (physically and mentally) to do what David (vugraphzpt) is doing.|pg||
nt|ritong: certainly so, yes|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|lc: It is hard enough to just enter the data. To comment as well is difficult.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: That type of hand must be painful for Brad|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|bjacobs: He can consult Fred on how to deal with it|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: As ong as you guys count the boards I aam ok|pg||
nt|lc: Many in field now play that a 2@H response to 1@C or 1@D shows this North hand.|pg||
nt|lc: It is called "Reverse Flannery by Responder" --|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|lc: 1minor-2@H =  4@H, 5@S, at most about 8-9 HCP.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Possibly a Meckwellian invention?  |pg||
nt|lc: 1minor-2@S shows same shape and invitational (10-11) or so.|pg||
nt|lc: I think Rodwell invented it -- not positive, though.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I play 4@D shows 6@D and 4@S with game values and good diamonds|pg||
nt|lc: It is really catching on.  Very good method.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lc: That hand is hard to describe otherwise -- you easily miss 4-4 @H fits.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Has north forgotten system|pg||
nt|ritong: uh oh|pg||
nt|lc: I don't think North forgot anything.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It certainly covers an awkward hand where to bid both suits is too much|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: just bids his hand|pg||
nt|lc: South just invented a 2@H reverse, it seems.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|vugraphzpt: Luckily Spades are higher than hearts|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe South though he was too good for a 4@C splinter.|pg||
nt|ritong: they will reach slam per force|pg||
nt|lc: I'd expect most of the field to reach 6@S -- but not all.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: You could practically just bid 4NT over 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Which suit is being asked about spades or hearts|pg||
nt|lc: My guess is 5@D by NORTH -- not WEst -- 1 Keycard.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpt: Maybe 14-30 none in hearts|pg||
nt|lc: But, North must think @H are trump -- so maybe 51D = 0 keycards?|pg||
nt|ritong: certainly so|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So, don't you think maybe this auction was unwise?  The direct 4NT looks better to me|pg||
nt|lc: Still, North did JUMP -- so hard for South to stay out of slam, you'd think.|pg||
nt|ritong: hence the "uh oh" remark|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Everybody looks confused|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpt: I would rather have bid 6@S over 1@S than go through this one|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lc: So, if 20 of the 24 tables bid this, and 4 miss it, that will be 52 crossimps (13 x 4).|pg||
nt|ritong: notice that south is certain of a 5+ @s suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, he has at least found that out|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|lc: Yes, if pard has 4@H (from the 4@H bid), he must have 5@S -- else he would have responded up the line.|pg||
nt|ritong: yup|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
mc|12|nt|vugraphzpt: OK if I lleave now?|pg||
nt|ritong: pls do:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As long as you return|pg||
