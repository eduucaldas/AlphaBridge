nt|vugraphzpt: Now there is a damaging lead - for the defence anyways|pg||
nt|lc: Not the best lead :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: @C10 switch is now good|pg||
nt|lc: Or the @CK, I suppose. But can he find it?|pg||
nt|bobh1: @hs looks attractive also how will he decide?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzpt: Because he is Pepsi|pg||
nt|lc: Wow -- hard to find that play -- unless you can see all 52 as we can.|pg||
nt|lc: Surely, it could have been wrong, but not this time!|pg||
nt|lc: So, many in field will play other contracts if 1NT is forcing.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Maybe he read something into the @D5|pg||
nt|lc: 1@S-1N-2@C->>|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i thought he might do that to knock out the entry to favourable s position|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: 3@D has chancess|pg||
nt|lc: Hard to reach too much into the @D5 -- not clear how much choice North had.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: In that case let's call it an educated guess|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lc: After 1@S-1N-2@C, it is not clear what would happen next (most in field use "BART" on that auction--2@D artif.)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: So maybe the lead was in fact good|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h4|pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|lc: So here, 1NT is on the way to -1, presuming no mistakes.|pg||
nt|lc: If Pepsi wins next @D, he has to guess to play partner for the right major-suit ace.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Given the @CK mistakes - um no|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|lc: If he ducks the next @D, dec can revert to @S and make it.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|lc: Now he has a guess of sorts.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|lc: And guess right!|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|lc: Surely, dec. could have had the @HA and not the @SA.|pg||
nt|lc: But, I think Lev's @C cards told the story.|pg||
mc|6|nt|lc: well done again by Pepsi (as on Bd. 1()(|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Not the defence you want when you are high up in the money|pg||
pg||
qx|o5|st||md|3ST7H42DT742CKQT63,S96HAKQJ86DJ63CJ4,SKJ8542H3DKQ85C97,SAQ3HT975DA9CA852|sv|n|nt|lc: Nope.  This will cost E-W.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lc: X or 2N?|pg||
nt|mittmouse: he probably couldnt take 7 tricks wo spades|pg||
nt|lc: All roads lead to 4@H, I'd think -- but maybe higher at some tables.|pg||
nt|mittmouse: wo spades|pg||
nt|lc: George likes 2NT -- he tells me privately.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|lc: And, so does Gitelman.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Sorry he bid that some time ago - just checking out something|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i told larry i love aces for nt|pg||
nt|lc: So, 4@D is one way to get to 4@H, but maybe 3@D then raise to 4@H to show mild slam interest.|pg||
nt|bobh1: moss will ponder slam possibilities now|pg||
nt|mittmouse: moss will bid 3nt i bet|pg||
nt|lc: All good players have "2 ways" to reach 4MAJ.  Direct Texas x-fer, or the slow way (x-fer then raise to 4).|pg||
nt|lc: One shows slam interest, the other none.|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|lc: 3NT is normally a Moss specialty, but fails to show the slam interest.|pg||
nt|bobh1: gittleman almost has a super-accept except that he is so light for his first bid|pg||
nt|lc: Beautiful work Bob -- I've never seen the words "accept" and "except|pg||
nt|lc: "used twice in a row perfectly!|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: and spelled right which is out of character for me|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lc: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Call for the coast guard rescue needed|pg||
nt|bobh1: gitelman is not shy|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|lc: They had better not get above the 5-level -- that is the end of the road.|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|lc: There is 0 chance of a carding mix-up.  So, a huge gain coming for Lev-Pepsi.|pg||
nt|bobh1: @s @d squeeze a small possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Revoke is Fred/Brad's best chance here|pg||
nt|lc: Dec has to give up a @D early to ruff a @D -- so no.|pg||
nt|bobh1: a kib pointed this out but i was looking at it too|pg||
nt|lc: 10 "aces" -- then a @Druff to get to 11. |pg||
nt|lc: Then, only hope is a black-suit squeeze -- which surely ain't workin'.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Yes so would nneed a two trick stuff up|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Mind you a third club on the table may have been more interesting on this lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|mittmouse: if he had the 6 0f c he could make it on that lead|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bobh1: the right lead . . . pd told you to lead a @S but god told you to lead a @c|pg||
nt|lc: I think even an extra @C trick wouldn't help.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|bobh1: god knows more about the hand than pd|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s5|nt|lc: He has to concede a @D to ruff a @D for his 11th.  So, that and a @C loser for sure.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, Pepsi is happy to see the @C spots -- now he knows dec has no @C trick coming.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: As I think the @C10 now may allow him to make but that it all|pg||
nt|mittmouse: with the 6 of clubs he has a 3rd trick in clubs and n gets squeezed with kq of d and spades|pg||
nt|lc: IN defense of Moss's bidding, if gitelman has more than a 14-count, this might have had play.|pg||
nt|bobh1: someone asks what about ducking the first @c?|pg||
nt|lc: That sounds right, George.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|lc: 26 HCP -- most of the week.|pg||
nt|lc: But is it a good 26?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: No jacks is always good.  But 4-3-3-3 is bad.|pg||
nt|bobh1: good enuf to make a game all by himself|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lc: Anyway, I'll take a chance and predict all 24 tables play in 3NT.|pg||
nt|mittmouse: will we see kokish in action|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Lev looked so surprised when the tray arrived with 3 pass cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|an|Alerted|mb|p|nt|bobh1: T of @d a plus value|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|mittmouse: y|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|lc: Very rare for all 4 players to be dealt 4-3-3-3.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|mittmouse: 2h forces 2s and now 2nt shows 25 plus|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|lc: So, some sort of "Kokish" relay -- where this presumably is 25-27 balanced, forcing.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: 3@S relay to 3NT.|pg||
nt|lc: See how fun modern bridge is? In the old days it would have gone PPP3NTPPP.|pg||
nt|bobh1: they must play 3n immediately over 2n as something else|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lc: Now, we get to see 4 rounds of bidding.|pg||
nt|lc: And 5 alerts.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Funnily enough Low spade works well here|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|lc: Now the @S suit is "frozen"|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lc: If declarer guesses right, when Git plays another @S (low or the 8), Lev can get 3 tricks.|pg||
nt|henryb: I am commenting in the other room. How are you|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Scores etc at http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=39&Itemid=50|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzpt: Fred has given the game away now by thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Smooth duck better but unlikely to succeed|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lc: But, declarer was never going to put int the 9.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|lc: Now the extra @S trick.|pg||
nt|lc: Lev seemed to have no trouble guessing.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Moss and Pepsi bemused|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cT|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lc: lots of matchpoints.|pg||
mc|11|nt|lc: Oh -- it is IMP scoring. OK. :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Sorry closing and reopening|pg||
