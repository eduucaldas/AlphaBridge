mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|ritong: orange team in trouble big time|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They are @S10 away from making slam here. Might be difficult to avoid. However, if they manage to set spades, they will discover that they are off one keycard and trump queen|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ritong: the worst moment to have a bad match|pg||
nt|gulyas: E got off to a good start by @Cs, but later discarded his 4th @C, and that not only cut him off the setting tricks, but also got him endplayed|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Maybe you can make 6@C, but it would be double dummy to get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|bgn: Spectator points out E/W have yet to play a hand. But they will be feeling good about beating earlier 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sater1957:  The misdefence was really bad. (As a Dutchmen) I hope they recover from this|pg||

nt|gulyas: it did not cost a trick this time|pg||
nt|sater1957:  both Dutch pairs feel it now. Things are not going well. Let us see how calm they stay|pg||

nt|sater1957:  6@S is good bidding thougjh|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|Walddk2: Let's predict 3NT now. That is the easy part. The difficult aspect is to make it|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|gulyas: 6 is a reasonable contract, you really have to be rallying to try for 7 on these hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: is this a Roland-grand?:)|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If North accepts, and he should, he might just as well pattern out en route. And he did|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: nah|pg||

nt|ritong: :|pg||

pc|hA|nt|bgn: heading for a difficult 3NT|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bgn: low @C lead leaves him with no real chance I think|pg||
nt|bgn: maybe he was tempted to double?|pg||
nt|ketoprak: seems you have a bad conn....?  :(|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 8 easy tricks unless he finesses spades, but I can't see a 9th coming|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|gulyas: I don't know how W knew E did not have the @DQ as well - or he would have bid 7 with that card?:)|pg||
nt|ritong: not that easy to reach the small slam|pg||
nt|gulyas: they have very good controls and a good fit|pg||

nt|gulyas: I don't say that EW may not gain on this small slam another 13:)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: As Walter Johnson points out, he could likely have made it double dummy by stripping East and endplay him in hearts|pg||

nt|gulyas: lets see if NS can untangle this and find their 4-4 @S fit|pg||
nt|ritong: we can suppose that south is aware about it|pg||

nt|gulyas: so far I cannot see who showed his 4c @S suit|pg||
mb|4N|nt|sater1957:  quantitative I guess, spade-fit gone|pg||
nt|gulyas: I think you can get home in 6@S, somewhat lucky tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|sater1957:  match not recoverable now, spade slam missed on last board|pg||
nt|gulyas: Henri, your prediction was right, the slam-hand was played in 4@S, so YET another 12 going to J-C|pg||
nt|ritong: no real surprise, 4@h really was opportune|pg||
nt|ritong: with flat hand and no clear source of tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tomi2: 2@C stayman etc. as after 1NT opening|pg||
