nt|ritong: i do not think so|pg||
nt|ritong: unless boards appeal it|pg||
nt|harmon: when I left last segment it was like 87-23|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: The Meltzer players are hoping for a lot of action|pg||
nt|ritong: these players are not crazy shooters, they will probably try to swing in borderline situations, but they certainly will not create them out of the blue|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ACBL CC for Berk-Cohen available at http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=520&Itemid=224|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|ritong: this an example of " borderline situation"|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ritong: although this kind of psych is pretty common nowadays|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: much easier 1N bid to make when opening bidder limited - i.e. no game forcing jump shifts coming|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: vulnerabilty is favorable, hand belongs to opponents very likely, so you try to bother them|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu1: Ekeblad alerted 3@c - Cohen asks why - 2NT would have shown 2 places to play - this is non-correctable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I think Granovetter had very tough decision|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: Pass for penalty, 2N scramble, 3@C as described -- all look reasonable|pg||
nt|mrace: so 2 nt would be scramble, not necesarilly weaker than 3 cl |pg||
nt|ritong: pass for penalty is not envisageable being + a ton, i think|pg||
nt|harmon: especially not with a big lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter didn't correct Ekeblad's description of 3@c, but it wasn't clear to me that he heard it so may not have intended 3@c as strongly 1-suited|pg||

nt|raghavan: Majors are with EW |pg||
nt|snorris: 3nt e-w?|pg||
nt|haans: spades?|pg||
nt|haans: again|pg||
nt|haans: 8-12 balanced = most common opening bid|pg||
nt|haans: ok so 6@D is perfect bridge :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i think so Hans its par isnt it|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: but par is rarely played in at 6 levels in my experience |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|roswolf: this could perhaps finish here|pg||
nt|werge: Here the opening bid gives away the winning line in 4 @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: 3nt easier|pg||
nt|haans: hard to find nt instead of @S|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|roswolf: but south will no doubt try something|pg||
nt|april7: 1@D 1NT 2@H X for take out or 3@H asking for @S and stopper in @H |pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|roswolf: south regretting his double|pg||
nt|raghavan: S hand is balanced may not try further|pg||
nt|haans: W bidding 3nt?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Having 4 spades i will not double to take out|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: it is certainly not absurd|pg||
nt|haans: do they have an agreement what 3@D mean|pg||
mb|3S|nt|raghavan: E has an opening hand - so now that W made sound, E likely to go for game bis |pg||
nt|raghavan: bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: see!|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: ah the exuberance of youth|pg||

mb|4S|nt|haans: but S x make passes good|pg||
nt|roswolf: north doesnt fancy this|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: best contract, 4-4 fit in @S is in that hand not good|pg||

pc|h4|nt|haans: they did well here|pg||
nt|raghavan: now breathing space for declarer - A Club lead might have created headache|pg||
nt|chick: I wonder why the 3N bid?  E certainly doesn't have a balanced hand, no stopper in either red suit, 4@S seems obvious to me.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: i mean it seems that there is only three tricks to lose but the singleton heart lea creates a losing option |pg||

nt|april7: to weak for 3@D vul.|pg||
nt|raghavan: Poland said at the beginning EW are current leaders so it is!!!|pg||
nt|raghavan: Roland|pg||
nt|haans: may be a winning hand|pg||
nt|werge: No difference - Roland or Poland|pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes Mr Hans possibly - why probably so|pg||
nt|lestergold: that lack of heart uff seems to be a palpanle error pard must have a stiff and a trump to ruff with or else declarer would have taken a dim discard on the heart|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: 4@S is more reasonable|pg||

nt|roswolf: majors hara-kiri|pg||
nt|raghavan: ah ah|pg||
nt|haans: at lest 4-4 in M may be very weak at non-vul|pg||
nt|roswolf: normalll at least 4-4 and less than an opening bid|pg||
nt|haans: i think 3nt show singel @D|pg||
nt|werge: 1 NT is the "less bad bid" with the W-hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: "Least Lie"|pg||
nt|vugraphzuj: one minor and inv to 3nt or 5 in the minor|pg||
nt|raghavan: How convenient to have DAQ over AK|pg||
nt|haans: yes who play clubs on 5-2 (none)|pg||
nt|haans: they need points badly?|pg||

mb|6D|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|raghavan: 1 diamond loser will go|pg||
nt|haans: still not score for 12 rounds|pg||

mb|p|nt|raghavan: thinking aboutentry problem |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: not allowed in my book|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+bal|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=8+ bal or something that doesn't apply|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ritong: ordinarily, 1@s 3@s says " hey, i have a solid suit, do yoàu stop @ss?"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=6+@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: zia found a way to use it more often|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and guarantees some singleton or void|pg||
nt|mrace: or "i have s @S stopper, do u have a solid suit ?" :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|ritong: btw, i m not sure paki is not a bit vulgar  can you tell me, jan?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: if so, i apol  my frenglish, u know..|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter says that 1@h showed either 8+ balanced or some 3-suiters 12-14. Ekeblad then says "I'll explain - he doesn't have the 12-14 hand, so has some balanced 8+ and I have 6+ ...|pg||

nt|raghavan: closed room 3H 1 down 140 minus 50 = so 3 IMP ghange|pg||
nt|haans: lot of info from hjelmis|pg||
nt|snorris: east would have opened if he had the q of @c too|pg||
nt|snorris: so north should have finessed|pg||
nt|santyclz: Could play for either, but not for both.|pg||
nt|raghavan: In open they bid and made 3NT deal 13|pg||
nt|raghavan: Haans - again 3NT for nS|pg||
nt|haans: bad 4@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: finally a slam without finesses|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|snorris: stone cold..|pg||
nt|raghavan: may be in 4H |pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s normal contract vul to club ruffs|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3nt from north is not a gimmee|pg||

nt|haans: Rekstad said NO|pg||
mb|3S|nt|raghavan: should find SQ to make|pg||
nt|haans: he is max for weak nt|pg||
nt|haans: so they find no slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: twice|pg||
nt|chick: S already showed a limit raise, why bid again?|pg||
nt|haans: why indeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: south's 12 count no shape now looks distinctly poor|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nervous players with just 1 to go?|pg||
nt|lestergold: we see that 4s is not a great contract even without ruffs in any case|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|april7: I think N is much to tsrongto give up!|pg||
nt|chick: maybe he assumes N is underbidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: f|pg||
nt|santyclz: 0 of 3 key cards are well played for declarer.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: telemark only 8 pts behind|pg||

pc|dA|nt|haans: may be a make|pg||
