mb|p|mb|4C|nt|2celik1: it's a new application for EW to show the Ace over 3X after 2@C oppenning |pg||
nt|buffytvs: the problem is that the key to the grand is East's diamond suit, and they may never get around to finding out about that|pg||

mb|6C|mb|p|mb|6H|nt|mariner1: well since the As and K@C have been cued the 5N here to me asks for extras.....|pg||

nt|mariner1: many do not play that way|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: W migth have tried 6@D over the 6@C as well|pg||
nt|2celik1: very pessimistic auction by Cerek,he might bid 6@D at least|pg||
nt|vugraphzut: M. Cerek is thinking to understand auction|pg||
nt|buffytvs: maybe if West starts off with 2@H and not 3@H, and gives partner a chance to describe his hand more|pg||
nt|murat e: w parner bidding in such a way he shd have bid seven decades ago besides he knows partner has nothing in spades thks to opps dbl|pg||
nt|2celik1: good point|pg||
nt|buffytvs: from East's POV, partner could have the @CQ and no @DK, perhaps with an extra heart|pg||
nt|buffytvs: or an extra spade, as Hedy points out|pg||
nt|murat e: ý suppose he bid 7 and our internet connection has gone|pg||
nt|mariner1: E may be wondering why W did not bid 6@D here|pg||

nt|cherdano:  but here North was so weak (no points in partner's suits) that he shouldn't mind playing 2@C|pg||
