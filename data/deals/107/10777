mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|cherdano:  and 2NT artificial?|pg||
nt|nulda: North player - Michal Kopecky - had a bid success at San Remo a month ago|pg||
nt|nulda: 5th place in Open Pairs category|pg||
nt|cherdano:  that is a nice result indeed|pg||
nt|nulda: 2NT relay|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that 1@C opening is not so much skinny as anorexic |pg||
nt|mdgraham: as Daniel said,,passing 5@Cx with a void and six card trump support just looked wrong|pg||
nt|april7: 9 or 10 tricks, depending on the play|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|gulyas: weird|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nulda: 3s minimum |pg||
nt|gulyas: with trumps not behaving, 2@S is the limit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but you can't imagine South passing now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5 imps, as 6@Cx-2 in the Open Room|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cherdano:  and South has second thoughts about inviting?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: o\_/ hand|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cherdano:  on a diamond lead South will set up clubs and a club ruff for an easy +650|pg||
nt|nulda: just two aces to give|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: Nab is calling TD after 4@s|pg||
nt|cherdano:  oh - if north bid a slow 3@S then there may be a problem|pg||
nt|nulda: I dont think, there should be a problem|pg||

pc|s2|nt|cherdano:  yes but why did South bid 2N?|pg||

pc|s9|nt|gulyas: I guess it didn't:)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||

pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: it always seems to happen - you open light and pard piles you into game|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cherdano:  especially if the overcall showed 12+|pg||
nt|nulda: as far as I know Milan Macura, he tryies for a slam on every opportunity|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i see|pg||

nt|cherdano:  btw, the swing on board 1 was caused by East's action over 1@S - he overcalled 1NT in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  which looks very reasonable to me|pg||
nt|nulda: they play 1@h 14-20 5+|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: we always have some wood in stock:)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Best kind of sac.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H presumably hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so 4NT for the minor|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@S just makes|pg||
nt|gulyas: and so does 5@C:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it looks as if it takes a diamond lead to beat 6@C|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cherdano:  so maybe North is tempted to bid more than 3@H here?|pg||
nt|gulyas: these teams are currently 8th and 6th, respectively, so they are both in the heat of qualifying (top8 Qs)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gulyas: I guess NS should sacrifice, all the way to 6@S:)|pg||
nt|april7: another 3NT but a litle more tricky|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gulyas: N, with no defense whatsoever outside @Ss could go to 5@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will lead a club, surely....and be somewhat narked by the outcome|pg||
nt|april7: now its easier again for N|pg||
nt|gulyas: now he has 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|nulda: in CR 4spades made from EW|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@C,3@D,2@H,1@S should be enough:)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|april7: he can finesse J of @C|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|santyclz: I'm conflicted about that, n having limited his hand with 1nt should usually leave such descisions to his pd, but this may be an exception.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|april7: E might develop10th trick by playing @S|pg||
nt|april7: but E will probably lead @D now|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|cherdano:  maybe North could have raised to 3@H right away|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @DJ looked a bit safer|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|nulda: W a bit two strong for 2s I suppose, 1s would be better|pg||

mb|p!|nt|athene: 2@D shows one major, 2NT lebensohl, 3@H pass/correct|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl probably shortness|pg||
nt|othered1: That double can't possibly be meant for takeout, can it?|pg||
nt|athene: sure, why not?|pg||
nt|athene: saying "whatever your suit is pd, we can compete in it"|pg||
mb|4D|nt|andyv:  well, the why not is if pd was trying to bail out, he will have to do it at the 4 level|pg||
nt|othered1: because it makes no snese, assuming 2N was lebensohl.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i agree it doesn't make that much sense|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: well, south didn't have to bid 2NT|pg||
nt|athene: it's not as though he was running away from 1NT doubled or anything|pg||
nt|athene: so north assumes ok he has to have SOMETHING|pg||
nt|athene: and north is so pure with @Hxx he decided he was prepared to go up a level|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  N had an all purpose hand... lots of D and didn't mind pd bidding his suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  good lead|pg||
nt|othered1: so you put your head on the block at the 4-level?  Even if the opponents know Rich's Rule, they may violate and scoop up a decent swing.|pg||
nt|athene: yes, if south decides to pass the double, north has (hopefully) four quick tricks|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|athene: i am not saying the double is routine or even correct, just that north did have some rationale for it :)|pg||

nt|nulda: cue-bid|pg||
nt|cherdano:  the 4@C cuebid should make south put on the brakes|pg||
pc|c9|nt|oliverc: no sign of that LOL|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gulyas: so, no matter how short 1@C can be, 2@C should always be a cue|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cherdano:  if he can read it as shortness|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|nulda: S has no brakes, as u should have seen before|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gulyas: this a good example of not having the same wavelength abt the values in overcall|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cherdano:  but now he will find out about the missing keycard and queen|pg||
nt|gulyas: if its OK to overcall with the S hand, N should not bid more than 2@C followed by 2@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: Agree 100%, Daniel.|pg||
nt|gulyas: now he is going down a lot|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. homework failure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North obviously took 2@D as showing a full value overcall|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gulyas: another homework problem there|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c4|nt|nulda: 2 out of 5 without the Q, even S found the brake pedal|pg||
nt|cherdano:  but maybe it is rather North who bid too much here|pg||
nt|cherdano:  he is minimum in their style, has a void in partner's suit|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s6|nt|cherdano:  and made two cuebids after a reverse|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=9  for standings after 9 rounds. First 8 after 13 rounds advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: tomorrow|pg||
nt|cherdano:  this is a bit of speculation of course as we don't know their exact agreement|pg||
nt|nulda: so 3 more RR matches in the afternoon|pg||
nt|gulyas: since N could be any strong hand, all S showed was his pattern, not his overall strength|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|cherdano:  5@S is already uncomfortably high|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is, but cards are very friendly|pg||
nt|cherdano:  how would you play it though? any 4-1 trump break is dangerous|pg||
nt|oliverc: You're asking the wrong person  -  Roland would be in 7 here LOL|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Win the club, cash two top spades ending in hand. If no queen, work with hearts. If West has four trumps I am still ok. Can't do anything if East has Q10xx anyway|pg||
nt|oliverc: sounds right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unblock @HQ first of course|pg||
nt|cherdano:  you still run into problems with spades 4-1 onside i think roland|pg||
nt|cherdano:  say you ruff a heart,how you dont have an entry back to hand|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i think you should play @DK earlier|pg||
nt|cherdano:  to set up a diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't I lead a spade up later? Requires that West has four hearts along with four trumps|pg||
nt|april7: N gets an uppercut in @S now|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|cherdano:  seems better to knock out @DA earlier, to get the @DQ as entry back to hand|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|april7: tricky now,@S King and @C J discrding the @H loser|pg||
nt|april7: or overruffing and discarding later|pg||

mb|p|nt|oliverc: 9 or 10 Boards?|pg||

nt|athene: if you wanted to bid it :)|pg||
nt|athene: twelve on top and south gets squeezed in the majors for the thirteenth|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: of course that's all fairly academic|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2D|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|othered1: This has been a close match -- closer and lower scoring than you might anticipate, looking at only the hands.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  well played by both sides|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|athene: if west knew WHICH singleton club his partner held, he would be getting much more excited|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@c seems to be the likely stopping point|pg||
nt|andyv:  over 3@c, I might have raised with the E hand|pg||
mb|4S|nt|othered1: if 2@C is game-forcing, east might evaluate the @CQ's value himself.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: in the Bridge World bidding challenge, singleton queens in partner's long suit are always the key :) you have to count them as about 6hcp :)|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|othered1: I fear this has found its way onto an unfortunate @H track|pg||
mb|5N!|mb|p|nt|athene: yes once east rebid hearts i think west's 4@D agreed hearts|pg||
nt|andyv:  6N is the safest contract looking at all the hands|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|athene: but 5nt pick-a-slam saved the day?|pg||
nt|othered1: can anyone translate the auction beginning with 4@D|pg||
nt|athene: from east's point of view, if his partner held @DKx, then clearly it's better if he declared, in clubs or no-trumps|pg||
mb|6H|nt|andyv:  I don't think it was in support of @hs|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: ah i am told 5NT was just a blackwood response|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  otherwise, why 3@c?|pg||
nt|othered1: do you really show Kx as a control here?|pg||
nt|andyv:  S is too greedy|pg||
nt|athene: that double could be VERY, very costly|pg||
mb|p|pc|d6|nt|andyv:  wow|pg||
nt|othered1: now, undeservably, it will show a profit instead of a huge loss.|pg||
nt|athene: although, to be fair, in my experience, people just don't run all that often |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|othered1: but the only thing to double on is trumps|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|andyv:  W should have ran |pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: so even though the books all say "don't double unless you can double whatever they might run to..."|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|nickd: its the last board in a very quite match, most probably he thought they needed a big swing|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|dJ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|athene: in practical play, you usually get away with these|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: unless opps have very clearly got an alternative strain that's appealing|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|othered1: redouble to show doubt with west's hand might have gotten them to 6N.|pg||

pc|h5|pc|d7|nt|nickd: would be a redoubt then :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
mc|10|nt|athene: west with weak hearts and great clubs was the one to run, i think|pg||
nt|othered1: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  good final board for the Greek team|pg||
nt|athene: as a spec points out, what is funny is, if they did run to 7@C, the bidding actually makes the squeeze findable|pg||
nt|othered1: I personally play that similar to a doubled 3N.|pg||
nt|andyv:  next match starts in 45 minutes|pg||
nt|athene: south is marked with hearts and quite likely the spades too|pg||
nt|athene: so you cash the @HA as a Vienna Coup and then run the clubs and south thinks "why didn't i PASS 6@H???"|pg||
nt|andyv:  thank you all for joining us...a quiet set of boards until the final eruption.|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|nulda: 3d one down I would bet|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Transfer to 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: There are two sequences possible. 1N-4@C-4@H and 1N-2@D-2@H-4@H.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Unless the latter is a slam try.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: partnerships can have fun deciding which sequence means what|pg||

mb|4N|nt|sunit: 88/91 now|pg||
nt|april7: hi, but would you like to be in 7NT? 6 @C is enough, but they will also play 6@H like in OR|pg||
nt|josj: nope...|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, 7 is for hands you want to make the newpaper column on|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: reasonable action from macura|pg||
mb|5S|nt|santyclz: Killing lead.|pg||
nt|josj: that's why I hope someone will bid 7 :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and the double of 6@H too for that matter|pg||
nt|gulyas: a nice triple squeeze really|pg||
nt|gulyas: that double is uncalled for|pg||
nt|april7: S should not X, they might run to NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl of 6@h in OR seemed suicidal, but neither W or E budged...almost like a deer caught in the headlights|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: yes, absolutely|pg||
nt|Walddk4: same happened in the other match|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6@C in one room, 6@HX in the other|pg||
nt|april7: but will E pass 6@C???|pg||
nt|andyv:  missing a control, W may opt for 6@c |pg||
nt|april7: he really should!!!|pg||
nt|april7: Q of @C a very big card!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@S is a convenient response to RKCK. 2 aces and trump queen. He has that whether hearts or clubs are trumps :)|pg||
nt|april7: decisive board!!|pg||
mb|5N|nt|cherdano:  yes first three tricks|pg||
nt|april7: W might opt for 6NT?|pg||
nt|mildredb: :)  didn't know there was a Mildred!  |pg||
nt|andyv:  W hasn't shown any support for @hs... time for E to reevaluate the Q@c|pg||
nt|april7: is 5NT a proposition to play?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=11  for standings after 11 rounds. First 8 after 13 rounds advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||

nt|andyv:  and E shows the k@s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh well, goodbye to 6@C and 6@H. I think the Greeks stop in 6NT|pg||
