nt|petergill: The U21 and U26 events are not being held separately - instead the U21 and U26 fields play together. I think there are about 40 tables from almost 30 countries. |pg||

nt|joest: hi Liz, Peter, William|pg||
nt|athene: east has a borderline decision over the strong club|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@C strong, I think NS play a Strong Club system|pg||
nt|joest: in what sense?  how high to fly?|pg||
nt|athene: emphasise the good suit, or treat the hand as a 2-suiter to get the highest-ranking suit into the game?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4D!|nt|athene: if he had shown @D+@S, west would have woken up|pg||
nt|joest: things can go wrong when you treat 6-4 as a two suiter.  Partner insists on spades with 3, etc.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sometimes it just doesn't matter!|pg||
nt|athene: if *she* sorry :)|pg||
nt|joest: it works great when you catch five I admit|pg||
nt|athene: yes, i agree, normally 6-4 is a 1-suiter|pg||
nt|joest: but the disasters can be spectacular|pg||
nt|athene: 7@H, 7NT here|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|cuttysark: Opposite a strong club South will drive to slam - the only question is, which slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like 2@D very much, perhaps even 3@D. You know it's not your hand. Take some room away from them|pg||
nt|joest: Lall with a good hand but no great way to express it|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|joest: it's harder to bid grands without trusty Blackwood though|pg||
nt|joest: but South's hand is gigantic and partner is making an above game slam try!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think the one thing South is almost certain of is that they have all the aces|pg||
nt|joest: Lall will worry about spade control and sign off|pg||
nt|cuttysark: His question is: do they have 13 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C denies the @SA|pg||
nt|athene: so if south ever makes any grand slam try, of course, that has to confirm the @SA|pg||
nt|joest: in that case 5@d should show a spade control as well as a diamond control|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|athene: north is doing very well to co-operate without many side aces to show|pg||
nt|athene: south can't bid much less than seven now|pg||
mb|7H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: one might even say he is overbidding :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: A tough decision fro Jeremy Fournier - well done|pg||
nt|athene: north knows his @CKQ is golden|pg||
nt|petergill: Super bidding by NS. |pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: powering partner's long suit, turning it into a trick source|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cuttysark: The play will not take long|pg||
nt|athene: when you have two good suits, all that matters is the aces, and seven is there|pg||

nt|haans: do not think they go that far|pg||

nt|joest: 4441 hands are very difficult to describe in a club system|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|athene: fortunately north might not give a negative|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|joest: unless you have a conventionfor them :)|pg||

mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: seems like 2@s might have shown a three suiter and 3@c showed where the shortness was|pg||

nt|petergill: event, hopefully. :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes that looks logical|pg||
nt|athene: north presumably was intending to play 3nt unless his partner showed a red singleton|pg||
nt|petergill: !@H 8-11 any, denies 5 spades, a spec tells me|pg||
pc|c5|nt|harmon: hey all|pg||
nt|joest: Jxxx is reason to fear 3NT|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|joest: but playing a 4-3 where you are getting tapped in the wrong hand is no picnic either|pg||
nt|athene: interesting - west didn't double 3@C with that holding|pg||
nt|joest: hi Harmon|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the last round today. Tomorrow and following days we have five rounds for you, two matches in each. Fixtures to be decided|pg||
pc|c9|nt|cuttysark: This can be made, but needs good views. I know I would go down :)|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps EW have a policy (like the italians) of avoiding lead-directing doubles|pg||
nt|joest: he has to duck here to block the suit|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|joest: then guess to work every suit BUT hearts|pg||
nt|joest: which means starting with a heart pitch right now|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Tricky entry position on a heart return|pg||
nt|athene: these "dummy gets squeezed" decisions are always a real pain|pg||
nt|joest: however single dummy playing for the heart onside looks simplest to me|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|athene: you just KNOW, whichever suit you give up, was behaving perfectly|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|petergill: If West had Q109 and East AKxxx, Justin had to cover the 2nd club, but Justin Lall judged well that from that holding West would play @C10|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He is going to rely on the heart finesse - woud not we all?|pg||

mc|7|nt|athene: after 1@D - 1NT, with a 4-4-4-1, you have no fit, no trick source|pg||
nt|joest: i don't think east is leading low from Axx unless he knows about club shortness|pg||

nt|cherdano:  another automatic opener for NS|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: we now have the rooms connected :)  wd |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 club?|pg||
nt|cherdano:  3@C probably shows both minors|pg||
nt|buffytvs: when the suit you open is dbleton KJ? an aceless 8-loser wonder?|pg||
nt|cherdano:  getting to 3N looks more normal|pg||
mb|3N|nt|haans: its the first day in school|pg||
mb|p|nt|onebid: it's 11 hcp and 1@D doesn't guarantee diamonds|pg||
nt|cherdano:  well it doesnt show diamonds, it shows a balanced 10-13|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: got that right|pg||
nt|cherdano:  here the opening propel EW too high|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no, I think EW did that to themselves|pg||
nt|cherdano:  of course, it would have been NW who are too high if East had made a penalty pass|pg||
nt|cherdano:  but with KQx of trumps, that wasnt so easy to find|pg||
nt|buffytvs: wasn't 3@C a diamond raise?|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i _think_ it shows both minors|pg||
nt|harmon: probably fit showing cause Justin always throws fits anyway|pg||
nt|cherdano:  Matt Meckstroth confirms, 3@C shows both minors, less than invite|pg||
pc|h8|nt|cherdano:  successful lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cherdano:  if declarer ducks to West's king, West can shift to the @CT|pg||

nt|petergill: Good club lead by East, by the way|pg||
nt|joest: yes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Amazing 6 flat boards - my matches never look like this|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|joest: your bidding might have something to do with it :)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: True|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another Grand Slam|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|joest: this one requires diagnosing diamonds as the trick source|pg||
nt|athene: unfavourable vulnerability does terrible things to you....NS have 5-5 spades but no way to wreak havoc|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think it will be very hard to diagnose the 14 top tricks, let alone 13|pg||
mb|3S|nt|petergill: Easiest to reach this one if East does the asking (4NT etc), and finds @DK and all the keycards. |pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: i agree Roland|pg||
nt|petergill: Harder to reach seven if West does the asking|pg||
mb|3N|nt|joest: yes if east blackwoods, then asks about kings and finds out about the diamond king|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Suggesting it is in any way easy is a bit harsh!|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|joest: not sure how they treat 3NT here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Would this be a Serious 3NT? (|pg||
nt|petergill: Looks like it|pg||
nt|joest: some would treat it as forward going, artificial, no ability to cue bid the ace of clubs|pg||
nt|joest: but this looks like it might have been natural|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I have a suggestion that 3NT may show a spade control - rather sensible if so|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT or 4@S now?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|joest: i disagree with that part|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: this is not the better player to be blackwooding...|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@C = one key card|pg||
nt|athene: strong club in the other room should have had an easier time getting there|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Very tough to realise that the diamonds are a source of tricks|pg||
nt|joest: headed to another push it looks like|pg||
pc|dT|nt|cuttysark: A quick claim|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|joest: some play that 4@d (over 2@H) = a raise + a trick source.   Most play it as a splinter.  The former treatment would be great here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: EW's Strong Club system in the Closed Room also found it too hard. |pg||
mc|13|nt|Walddk2: wow, this is fast, only 2 boards remain|pg||
nt|athene: you should get there if you play strong club and relays after it - west just finds out his partner's entire hand except the @DJ|pg||
pg||

mb|1C!|nt|jcwla: Better @C play by Lall in other room but chose to work on @H's rather than @S's and ended up the same down two for another push.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H!|nt|cherdano:  1@C = 16+|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  1@H = 8-11 |pg||
mb|2H|nt|cherdano:  (i assume)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|bigtrain: u r correct |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 42 taking the lead|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cherdano:  now if East keycards|pg||
nt|cherdano:  West can show his hand completely|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|cherdano:  West opts for a stopperless 1N bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  rather than 2@H with a flat hand and a 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: W beat him to keycard|pg||
mb|6H|nt|cherdano:  not clear what the best line for declarer is|pg||

nt|harmon: uh oh Linda is here|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: moral support :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cherdano:  i see 4@S was keycard|pg||
nt|cherdano:  knowing they are limited to 32 hcp, West doesn't try for grand - will be disappointed to find perfect cards with East|pg||
pc|sK|mc|13|nt|jcwla: Same contract in OR -- hard to find out about the 5 @D tricks -- yet another push.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: You can ask for jacks too|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: i agree Peter but it is definitely a treatment not without merit|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|cuttysark: However, they keep getting under your feet when you play asking relays|pg||
mb|2H|nt|harmon: usually would need better d's tho|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: for some a 'free' 2@s bid would be enough.  But when you're young....... 3@s it is|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: the fifth spade is huge on the auction|pg||
nt|joest: actually no I'm looking at the wrong hand, 3@s is definitely right|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: he would surely bid 2@S on that hand with the @C2 instead of the @S2|pg||
nt|petergill: It will be interesting to see how a top player such as Justin Lall plays 3@S. |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well worth 3, I should say|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|petergill: Ducking @CA is usually best in these positions, even if the club is a singleton - well done.|pg||
nt|athene: of course he would like to lead clubs twice from hand but entries are short|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, when you have 4 clubs it rarely costs|pg||
nt|athene: notice the technique of setting up some side tricks right away, leaving trumps basically as heart stoppers|pg||
nt|athene: most novices, in these sort of hands, go for their ruffs right away|pg||
nt|petergill: Justin Lall's expert technique is to set up his side suit first, not weakening his trump position by ruffing in dummy, for now.|pg||
nt|athene: "i have a singleton heart in dummy! @HA, heart ruff"|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And he has given East a problem|pg||
nt|athene: but you are usually better-off setting up a few winners elsewhere first|pg||
pc|h7|nt|joest: a trump back seems strongest since she has clubs under control|pg||
nt|petergill: Good point Bill - this is just the type of fiddly card play hand which separates the real experts from the next best players|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|joest: now a diamond up while you're at it|pg||
nt|athene: if the @HK was to be believed, that was safe to run the heart|pg||
nt|petergill: East's thinking probably was that if Justin wouldn't shorten dummy's trumps, then she would. Not a success this time|pg||
nt|athene: there was an interesting inference|pg||
nt|athene: if east is guaranteed not to underlead @HA at trick 1|pg||
nt|athene: then west, with @HKJ, should perhaps play the @HJ in third|pg||
nt|joest: then again if the pointed aces are switched it is probably right to start ruffing hearts|pg||
nt|athene: in which case|pg||
nt|petergill: Justin Lall doesn't know yet if @DA is onside ... if East has @SA, then West has @DA|pg||
nt|athene: after trick 1|pg||
nt|athene: north was known to have the @HJ|pg||
nt|athene: and furthermore from the @HK he knows that east has the @HQ :) so the heart was perhaps costly|pg||
nt|petergill: E and W are twin sisters|pg||
pc|d8|nt|joest: I have some partners I am afraid to play the J from KJx|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||

nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|cherdano:  not so easy to bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|sybarra: a non vul 2 suiter |pg||
nt|haans: thats a new one|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: in NL  they call it Muiderberg |pg||
nt|cherdano:  still West can confirm keycards|pg||
mb|d|mb|2D!|nt|haans: with that weak hand?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think Verbeek is looking for some action here  |pg||
nt|bigtrain: normal precision it's easier...  E makes a @D positive then W can visualize grand|pg||
nt|cherdano:  confirm having all keycards, and sometimes East can just bid 7 on a spade or club trick source|pg||
nt|cherdano:  2@D showing a good heart raise|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some play that bidding 6 says a keycard is missing.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|sybarra: or maybe it is just a 5 card (very) wk 2 |pg||
nt|haans: 3@H better than normal with @H|pg||
nt|lml: now vulnerable and with a 6 card suit this time I bid lots|pg||
nt|cherdano:  and this time it would be successful, too|pg||
nt|lml: yes :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: do you agree to such opening when P is not a passed hand|pg||
nt|cherdano:  so 2@D promised 3 hearts and 8+ points to be precise|pg||
mb|d|nt|buffytvs: wimpy pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: 'look for reasons to bid, not reasons not to bid'  D. Colbert|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|cherdano:  what did this double show?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: remember that old joke about my nose runs and my feet smell|pg||
nt|cherdano:  East has a nice stopper and a 6-card suit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: if matt has similar agreements to his dad...  2@D shows exactly 3@H and about 6-9 dummy points|pg||
nt|jcwla: OR is also playing 3@S.|pg||
nt|cherdano:  North bid 3@S in the other room instead of 2@S|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cherdano:  2@S doesnt look like enough to me either|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|lml: he is upside down|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: and now only on a @D finesse|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|haans: throw in also called nedplay possoble|pg||
nt|haans: endplay|pg||
nt|bigtrain: N does have alot of losers and knows his patrtner is somewhat limited|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|cherdano:  2NT might be down too|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|bigtrain: personally i think 2@S is about right|pg||
nt|jcwla: Ditto.|pg||
nt|cherdano:  limited due to the opponents' bidding?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|s7|nt|lml: beside it is a VUL game|pg||
nt|lml: you should bid it if it sniffs at you|pg||
nt|bigtrain: and more than half his values won't contribute to offense|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|haans: easy|pg||
nt|lml: the one he bid was a NV game|pg||
nt|cherdano:  but i think game will be good opposite many minimum takeout doubles with 4 spades|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|cherdano:  @SATxx and AK in one minor - ok these are perfect cards maybe|pg||
