nt|vugraphzus: after 4nt he can ask extras with 5nt .and he will get @d K for grand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then W should bid 5N as a grand slam try over 5H. not practical to play it specifically as Josephine by 2C opener|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we are playing 10 boards here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzus: and threw it|pg||
nt|sharynr: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  EW should get to 4@H here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|haans: 3@C best bid|pg||
nt|sharynr: agree|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharynr: should not expect a @S fit |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks Basar, hard for you when we lose connection|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no swings here then|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: its ok |pg||
nt|rnmalik: short and sweet-no trouble for us.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: you can play 5nt as Q ask|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we appreciate your efforts :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: u welcome:)|pg||
mb|2C!|an|gazillie|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 2@C = any game force?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good old gazillie|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|cherdano:  and meanwhile 5 IMPS to Italy, as North found a more successful @H lead at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: she did not jump|pg||
nt|sharynr: Once again, a touch too high|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|haans: but no jumping from E :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: too bad, 3nt would have been better|pg||
nt|don paulus: good action by S|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: maybe. 2H going down. in my view it is better and safer to act initially on the S hand|pg||
nt|haans: me 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: looks like Noname have a decent win here barring a disaster on 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzus: passed 3nt |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: strange|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cherdano:  2N 18-19 balalnced, 3@D transfer, 3@S superaccept i assume|pg||
nt|garnetts: slam needs both major suits to break 3-2 with an extra residual chance in spades and the club ace right or led |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: and some more greek speech |pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|cherdano:  after @CAK and seeing the heart break, declarer can endplay South|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: seems that way.i couldnt read notes|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|cherdano:  so he won't need the @D finesse|pg||
nt|sharynr: yes, kib suggests a trump back to let declarer do all the owrk|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|sharynr: work*|pg||
nt|don paulus: would you then prefer 2 @c over dbl ? with only 3 @s ?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s4|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s8|nt|haans: yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i prefer double, since S lacks club ten|pg||
nt|haans: x of 2@H usually mean no spades|pg||

pc|s6|pc|d6|pc|s9|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|haans: an original match|pg||

nt|minimonkey:  spades arent working and declarer is working on clubs and diamonds|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|nigel_k:  This does remove his entry to one spade trick I guess|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  Partner can do that when he wins a heart honour, you know he has to have one|pg||
