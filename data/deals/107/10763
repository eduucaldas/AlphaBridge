nt|vugraphzus: after 4nt he can ask extras with 5nt .and he will get @d K for grand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then W should bid 5N as a grand slam try over 5H. not practical to play it specifically as Josephine by 2C opener|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we are playing 10 boards here.|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|vugraphzus: and threw it|pg||

nt|vugraphzus: its ok |pg||
nt|rnmalik: short and sweet-no trouble for us.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Operator, please check the result on bd 28.  It looked to be -1.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes pl|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt coming up some how |pg||
mb|2S!|nt|haans: you can play 5nt as Q ask|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we appreciate your efforts :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: u welcome:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Not that it makes much of an imp difference.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S looks likt transfer to clubs |pg||
mb|3N|nt|kiwibridge: 2@C = any game force?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good old gazillie|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  and meanwhile 5 IMPS to Italy, as North found a more successful @H lead at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: she did not jump|pg||
nt|sharynr: Once again, a touch too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: but no jumping from E :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: too bad, 3nt would have been better|pg||
nt|don paulus: good action by S|pg||
pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: maybe. 2H going down. in my view it is better and safer to act initially on the S hand|pg||
nt|haans: me 2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: even in this sequence-looking for @S check I think|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kiwibridge: looks like Noname have a decent win here barring a disaster on 10|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzus: passed 3nt |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: strange|pg||
nt|sybarra: that lead doesnt hurt |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|cherdano:  2N 18-19 balalnced, 3@D transfer, 3@S superaccept i assume|pg||
nt|garnetts: slam needs both major suits to break 3-2 with an extra residual chance in spades and the club ace right or led |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: and some more greek speech |pg||
nt|sybarra: that could be right also |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|cherdano:  after @CAK and seeing the heart break, declarer can endplay South|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: seems that way.i couldnt read notes|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cherdano:  so he won't need the @D finesse|pg||
