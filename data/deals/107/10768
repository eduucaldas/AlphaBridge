nt|kit: east can see that even if he can force dummy with a diamond, declarer can still set up the spades -- so he might as well cash, sadly|pg||

nt|iris100:  made 12 tricks in the open room|pg||
nt|iris100:  11|pg||
nt|iris100:  only small @S lead (not very likely) holds it to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|wygbe1: south can do the same by winning in hand, cashing d ace, and leading a spade - setting up the spade suit with ruffs, as h are 22|pg||

nt|Walddk5: N-S are Israeli ladies and won the silver medal in the U21 series recently at the European Youth Championships in Romania|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rnmalik: nothing works for declarer|pg||

nt|haans: hi Paul|pg||
nt|ybob: 4@S looks fine|pg||
mb|1D|nt|petergill: Aotearoa is Kuke Gardiner from Wanganui, NZ, Blair Fisher from Hamilton NZ, Michael Whibley from New Zealand, and Michael's partner is from Argentina. |pg||
nt|petergill: Luke|pg||
nt|wygbe1: light opening by east|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: do not hard cards for 6@D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: part score here. NS may reach 4@H but.....................|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a quiet part score to let the nerves settle|pg||
mb|1H|nt|don paulus: another 3 nt - EW this time|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|don paulus: y favourable @c split|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|iris100:  in first seat vul. ... I donÂ´t like it|pg||
mb|1N|nt|haans: what is showing and what is asking|pg||
nt|don paulus: NS may compete in majors - could be good result - if - 3 dbl = only 500|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now with stiff@DK S willbe tempted to bid 4@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: X by S 2@S by W should end it|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Joe WLC|pg||
nt|don paulus: may pass out now|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|rnmalik: Pass would do them good.|pg||
nt|haans: i do not say 2@S is bad bridge |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: must still find @DJ|pg||
nt|sharynr: i don't see the N-S team on the roster of players|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wow game made other room|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Rahed, don't think we've met.|pg||
nt|haans: close between 2 and 3|pg||
nt|haans: clubs right dim right|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: that is my choice|pg||
nt|santyclz: (Rashed), sry.|pg||
nt|haans: spade right|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: an other fast claim?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: We are meeting now:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: We can guess, any game force, bal min, relay, ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think Visser can bid 3 nt now |pg||
nt|petergill: The Argentina youth flew from Argentina to New Zealand, then to Turkey, so is probably the most travelled competitor in the field. |pg||
nt|wygbe1: i also would have passed|pg||
nt|iris100:  tough lead|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sharynr: sorry, I mean E-W|pg||
nt|don paulus: and @s ok if he finds Q|pg||
nt|iris100:  how many S will overcall 1@H do you think?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzus: they started early .so i missed the first board s play.sorry.|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT looks safe, should make easily. |pg||
pc|sT|nt|haans: np|pg||
nt|haans: nothing to see or miss|pg||
nt|don paulus: we got the result - thats fine|pg||
nt|sybarra: tremendous number of frequent flyer miles!|pg||
nt|petergill: If played by East, a heart lead would shoot 3NT. |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|rnmalik: must be bad defense-@S lead only helps|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: sound polish|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|sharynr: prob should trump and then lead diamond to 10 if no king|pg||
nt|sybarra: jrs. care about that |pg||

nt|don paulus: guess flat board unless NS decide to bid 4 @h or @s other room|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt down if silent|pg||
nt|rnmalik: action hand|pg||
nt|haans: bloody deal|pg||
nt|sybarra: action hand here |pg||
nt|petergill: An action hand |pg||
nt|don paulus: it was all limit and all key cards favourable|pg||
nt|iris100:  2@C was the contract in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: This hand has some action potential.|pg||
nt|haans: we all say the same :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|iris100:  standard 4@S now|pg||
mb|1C|nt|don paulus: 2 @h NS ?|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: 3@D max|pg||
nt|petergill: EW will bid to 4@S, Blair Fisher will bid 5@D, then what?|pg||
nt|haans: slam in spades|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S Michaels, 5/5 spades and a minor|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think to 5 @H by n/s|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: 1st board a push|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H I mean|pg||
nt|sybarra: in tempo pls.  5 @H |pg||
nt|haans: 6@S please|pg||
mb|2S|nt|haans: how to make opps pass|pg||
nt|garnetts: Interesting choice by East--but if 1@C is nebulous it is probably best to pass|pg||
nt|haans: 7@H good sac|pg||
nt|petergill: Blair might bid 5@C or 5@D or 5@H, I'm not sure which|pg||
nt|sybarra: there is the lead director |pg||
nt|wygbe1: i would think south is worth 2s, and n has easy raise to 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: not right|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we're back|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@C cue is his choice, as a slam try|pg||
nt|petergill: Blair is on lead to @s, so it is not lead directing|pg||
mb|4S|nt|garnetts: I really do not like that with only four hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: true sorry |pg||
nt|petergill: Luke bids 6@C, in case they have a 4-4 club fit with his @d losers able to be discarded on the long @H's |pg||
nt|haans: looks like 6@S will be the end|pg||
nt|petergill: Andy Hung now thinks that partner has @D's!|pg||
nt|haans: after a cue cannot sac|pg||
nt|petergill: The lack of entries to dummy makes the play of @H contracts difficult|pg||
nt|haans: if hung x no 6@S|pg||
nt|petergill: Andy Hung is one of the stars of Australian youth bridge - he has won international youth events such as the Pacific Asia Teams playing for Australia|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: what would you bid Hans, with east hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: another boring board|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now the passed hand starts to push|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3nt?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: nothing |pg||
nt|sybarra: nothing wrong with 5 clubs is there?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  1@s is not enough with South, maybe she was considering 3@s|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North will raise to game anyway|pg||
nt|iris100:  for a junior, 2@S is quite disciplined|pg||
pc|h7|nt|haans: but close to something|pg||
nt|sharynr: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: forcing pass by Andy?|pg||
nt|haans: if NS find there 8 @H EW more likely to find spades|pg||
nt|don paulus: interesting lead for declarer|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: 2-2 in M do not like|pg||
nt|rnmalik: but only 8 tricks on @D lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rnmalik: yes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we lost our score from board 2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1, if no defense error|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and got away with it|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: screen has gone down.declarer asking some questions|pg||
nt|santyclz: I wasn't recommending 3nt, but half expected it in a jr's game.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|petergill: Great 6@S bid by Andy Hung|pg||
nt|ybob: 8 tricks cold|pg||
pc|dA|nt|petergill: Note that even with two aces, Blair Fisher has the discipline not to double 6@S|pg||
nt|haans: does not need @DK right but no @D lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharynr: but looks like a good hand for vul save|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|petergill: For those (like me) who find access to the website and its Results page (including its Running Scores section) almost impossible, here are the standings after 5 matches, with some ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Round 6 results in brackets|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: did hung bid it to make?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kiwibridge: will be -1 in the end|pg||

pc|c8|nt|garnetts: No point in asking questions ----needs the Q@S onside for one light|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: defense error = 8+ to ckis|pg||
nt|garnetts: Interestingly the defence will need to be on their toes to crack 4@H played by west|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|haans: that was wrong|pg||
