nt|Walddk4: tomorrow|pg||
nt|elbec: welcome to this semifinal between Italy and USA|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: E is one of the several good Drijver brothers:) Bob I think|pg||
nt|gulyas: OK, confirmed, its Bob|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@C either a multi of some sort, or a major 2 suiter (but my guess is, its a multi variation)|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@S was pass or correct|pg||
nt|chick: which means W may need to decide if 3@S could be a real suit|pg||
nt|gulyas: the double was just showing a good hand I would think, and I have no clue what 3@S would want to mean:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: OK, I am told that 2@C was in fact BOTH majors|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|gulyas: 5-4 and up|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|gulyas: hey Joe:)|pg||
nt|jstokes: will likely get to slam now; will make with a heart lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: 2 rounds,each rounds 14 boards|pg||
nt|gulyas: Italy Red beat France in an easy match, whereas USA Blue had to sweat it out and win by 1 IMP against Greece|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  this seems like the normal auction|pg||
nt|elbec: second section of semifinal between italy and usa|pg||
pc|dK|nt|april7: without a @S lead are 5 @C possible but 5@D bye NS are in|pg||
nt|april7: 6@C though is a good save by EW|pg||
nt|mdgraham: some might have bid 2@D over 1@H with the North hand - king to six not to be sneezed at |pg||
nt|santyclz: Re Daniel.|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Ozgur and Daniel|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello everyone, welcome to the second half of the QFs |pg||
nt|gulyas: which was a surprise since they won the prelims by a huge margin|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: HÝ ALL WELCOME|pg||
nt|elbec: this is going to be expensive for USA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gulyas: USA Blue topped the field after 13 rounds, by a huge 46VP margin, so they are the hot favourites here|pg||
nt|garnetts: No reason for west not to lead a heart--|pg||
nt|garnetts: The contract is safe anyway|pg||
nt|gulyas: altho a @S lead would have been more testing|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: easy 3NT first up|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=10  for standings after 10 rounds. First 8 after 13 rounds advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: tomorrow|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS getting to 5@D now|pg||
nt|jstokes: East wondering if the @HK is worth anything (it is :))|pg||
nt|gulyas: hey Joe:)|pg||
nt|jstokes: Hi Daniel|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gulyas: N will pull that|pg||
nt|gulyas: he does have a 6card support and a void after all:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: so then obv 3@S was SHOWING stop, since the opps have 2 suits|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello Andy, Ozgur|pg||
nt|andyv:  good contract|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cherdano:  North is 5-5 but has bad suits and the wrong shape to act over 2@H in the passout seat|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, well bid by NS|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gulyas: hmm|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The Curse of the Commentator strikes again|pg||
nt|don paulus: hi all|pg||
nt|elbec: hi paul|pg||
nt|don paulus: ciao :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|april7: and no defensive values at all and is vul. so a pullwould be obvious, but I also think the X was not the best bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: I agree with that too|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Joe :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: and hoping for 3NT with @H stop, but that all was messed up by S's 4@S bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=12  for standings after 12 rounds. Top 8 after this round advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: tomorrow|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Corielia.  |pg||
nt|chick: I don't know about "messed up", NS down at least a couple :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: it would be hard to read that it takes a @D lead to beat slam|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|gulyas: so currently, Italy Red are 5th, Australia 9th, both fighting for qualification|pg||
nt|gulyas: it is so good that it actually makes:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|jstokes: diamond lead will be successfull but seems impossible to find|pg||
nt|gulyas: with the lucky lie of cards (@Cs 3-3) the losing @D can be discarded|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s9|nt|april7: rather 6@D than X i would suggest|pg||
nt|gulyas: a good convention here would have been the so called Polish double by N (showing an interest in some OTHER suit but the one he bid and got cued on)|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, their well thought out defence was messed up:)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gulyas: Greecoura is a Greek team, they finished 5th in the preliminaries|pg||
nt|andyv:  nothing to the play|pg||
nt|gulyas: I assume USA Blue picked them as opponents for the QF|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the USA team chose them for this round.|pg||
nt|rgdruru: hi|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s3|nt|april7: but one should not be to greedy|pg||
nt|garnetts: well it would be more testing but will still make --provided declarer holds up and takes two finesses into east|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|gulyas: it looks like NS loses at least 1 trick in each suit|pg||
nt|santyclz: Quite a x by w with his powerhouse.  Looks as if it will work out well though.|pg||
nt|gulyas: it would still have been a 50-50 shot at best for S to find out which minor to lead|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|garnetts: would have to take it on a spade lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: probably|pg||
nt|gulyas: he is afraid that all finesses are off|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|santyclz: Excuse me, *her* powerhouse.|pg||
nt|chick: well, E did double and then cuebid even with W's pass|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gulyas: he did refuse one finesse already...|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: declarer will not be certain who has the long clubs - if he thinks East has them, he will play diamonds normally - if West, he may run @DJ  |pg||
nt|gulyas: so if he ducks this, he gets a @H play, and the defense will have 5 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|gulyas: forcing dummy is a good idea, that way they cannot use the side suit in @Hs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gulyas: so if @Ss are 6-2, he has to take it|pg||
nt|gulyas: but he got it right|pg||
nt|garnetts: Might go off if he plays east to have bared a notional K@D in the end game|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/VGData/minirama.html  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|gulyas: he also might go off if he tries to endplay E|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|gulyas: 4@H would have been 1 off probably|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|gulyas: they are lucky this went down at all|pg||
nt|gulyas: with @Ds 1-1|pg||
nt|gulyas: unless they find the @S ruff|pg||
nt|chick: this is going to be a big swing to start the round ... wonder how it will affect morale for the rest|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S does not exactly seem automatic in reply to a reopening double, but it certainly has worked out well here|pg||
nt|gulyas: declarer sighs of relief when he sees the @C discard|pg||
pc|c9|nt|gulyas: he will just play them normally, it is not likely that W plays @Cs that way if he had 5 of them|pg||
nt|mdgraham: either of which will work|pg||
nt|gulyas: right now, the @D finesse looks safe|pg||
pc|c6|pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|pc|h4|nt|gulyas: oh-oh, he is going for the endplay|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|garnetts: Strange hand but he played it well--the operation was a success but the patient died |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|gulyas: he could have gone down if @Cs were 4-4 tho|pg||
nt|gulyas: so, a push here, not surprisingly|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jstokes: now will test clubs, with the diamond finesse in reserve|pg||
pc|h6|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h2|mc|9|nt|rogerclee: why would east double with a balanced 11 count|pg||
nt|rogerclee: for one it could just make with lots of overtricks, but the other reason is that he already expects a heart lead|pg||

nt|Walddk4: tomorrow|pg||
nt|andyv:  same contract in OR|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think decalrer deserved that for a fine line of play--but east will be gutted|pg||
nt|gulyas: the only time he cannot take the @D finesse was if @Ss were 4-4|pg||
nt|elbec: same lead in the open room|pg||
nt|elbec: and same result...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club ten dropping on second round would also see the slam home'|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: but if the @Ss ran, he had 9 tricks from top|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, if @SJ had fallen, he would have had nine on top|pg||
nt|april7: an easy 3NT by NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  E hand a deceptively poor opener|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3 aces is always a good opener|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
nt|don paulus: 3 nt NS ?|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Macura|pg||
nt|nulda: 1s sound overcall 12+|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: snap :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: so I don't totally agree with you there|pg||
nt|elbec: good result for NS in open room|pg||
mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|gulyas: EW can try 3NT, but it fails if it gets a @D lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: but yes, it was E who did the last wrong thing|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|elbec: 12-14 no trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  and 2NT artificial?|pg||
nt|nulda: North player - Michal Kopecky - had a bid success at San Remo a month ago|pg||
nt|nulda: 5th place in Open Pairs category|pg||
nt|cherdano:  that is a nice result indeed|pg||
nt|nulda: 2NT relay|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that 1@C opening is not so much skinny as anorexic |pg||
nt|mdgraham: as Daniel said,,passing 5@Cx with a void and six card trump support just looked wrong|pg||
nt|april7: 9 or 10 tricks, depending on the play|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: nt:12-14|pg||
nt|jstokes: club lead seems best for the def; might hold it to 7 tricks|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  no spot cards make the hand poor|pg||
nt|gulyas: spot cards are bad, agree there|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d lead almost called for on this auction|pg||
nt|gulyas: lets see if S finds the killing lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: unless pd has a @H honor...|pg||
nt|gulyas: but I agree, @Ds should be led|pg||
nt|andyv:  sometimes you have to trust the opps|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: weird|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@C as we have seen is both majors, x probably showing a wk NT worth hand, or any strong hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: since this time its 13 balanced, she passed the forward-going 3@C|pg||
nt|gulyas: this looks like 4 tricks off the top, but with the @H ruff also coming, it will probably go down|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh-oh|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this will be over quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|nulda: 3s minimum |pg||
nt|gulyas: with trumps not behaving, 2@S is the limit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but you can't imagine South passing now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5 imps, as 6@Cx-2 in the Open Room|pg||
nt|garnetts: The killing lead --if South gets it right|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cherdano:  and South has second thoughts about inviting?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: o\_/ hand|pg||
nt|chick: excellent duck|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lovely.  Tough play.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cherdano:  on a diamond lead South will set up clubs and a club ruff for an easy +650|pg||
nt|nulda: just two aces to give|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: Nab is calling TD after 4@s|pg||
nt|cherdano:  oh - if north bid a slow 3@S then there may be a problem|pg||
nt|nulda: I dont think, there should be a problem|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=9  for standings after 9 rounds. First 8 after 13 rounds advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: tomorrow|pg||
nt|nulda: 4@s normal bid after 2s of N|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, if N's bidding suggested an 11-13 range, I would|pg||
nt|gulyas: duck is a good move, now he just needs to have his entries to take all the finesses he needs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: since this is more or less a nothing hand, i have some thoughts on the previous deal, regarding multi vs a weak two....|pg||
pc|h7|nt|cherdano:  yes but why did South bid 2N?|pg||
nt|gulyas: S only trusted his own suit, and that backfired|pg||
nt|gulyas: he has to take this and return it, or duck the 1st round|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|gulyas: since N's @S10 can be the setting trick|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh|pg||
nt|don paulus: guess got to go down here|pg||
nt|rgdruru: yes, 2 down|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gulyas: I guess it didn't:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|garnetts: Nothing else to do actually--but he found it|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|nulda: probably slam trying :)|pg||
nt|chick: but it also cuts off communication for the heart ruff|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  a big pick up for Blue as OR stopped at 3@c|pg||
nt|gulyas: 7 IMPs to the US team instead of 5 the other way|pg||
nt|gulyas: the Greeks cannot afford too many mistakes like this|pg||
nt|andyv:  the lead is tough and K@d was the only entry to S's hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  as one spec points out, the contracted was also right sided|pg||
nt|andyv:  contract|pg||
pc|c8|nt|gulyas: good save there|pg||
nt|garnetts: that is very poor play |pg||
nt|gulyas: N can still work this out|pg||
nt|gulyas: take it and play a @C|pg||
pc|cA|nt|garnetts: but North might save the day |pg||
nt|marlowepi: the weak 2 left the stroing hand in passout seat, and this made it unlikely that EW would reach the slam--the 3S bid by E was very aggressive. in contrast, multi allowed the strong ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hand to double directly, so now 3S by E was much easier. something to think about|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|cherdano:  that would be a little aggressive :) |pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: it always seems to happen - you open light and pard piles you into game|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, that will help with avoiding the ruff|pg||
nt|gulyas: a @D would work as well|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cherdano:  especially if the overcall showed 12+|pg||
nt|nulda: as far as I know Milan Macura, he tryies for a slam on every opportunity|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i see|pg||
nt|cherdano:  here a duck by East would have given declarer a small problem to think about|pg||
nt|cherdano:  whether to take the @S finesse at all|pg||
pc|cT|nt|garnetts: well done |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello Joe|pg||
nt|mdgraham: of course, that may not be a light opening for NS. They may have an agreement that they open such hands |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hey Joe|pg||
nt|april7: a play to J of @H would have been a better idea than finesse in @C , this finesse had time to be done|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|santyclz: Hi Dan, Mike.|pg||
nt|gulyas: since N chose @Ss, @Hs was likely to be 5-2|pg||
nt|rgdruru: now -1|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gulyas: if they do, S certainly overbid|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzur: sorry all connection problem|pg||
nt|elbec: anyway another good result by italy when only 12 boards are missing|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on the 40th anniversary of Woodstock, that was too much to resist|pg||

pc|d3|nt|garnetts: I would find another partner if a club isn't led |pg||
nt|gulyas: yep|pg||
nt|gulyas: the lead was clearly a doubleton|pg||
nt|don paulus: 12 imps|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|elbec: which make 33 total imps of advantage|pg||

nt|gulyas: 10 badly needed IMPs for France|pg||

nt|cherdano:  btw, the swing on board 1 was caused by East's action over 1@S - he overcalled 1NT in the other room|pg||
nt|chick: lots of good inferences to make ... well done!|pg||
nt|santyclz: This looks like fun.|pg||
nt|gulyas: since he decided to overcall with that pile, at least he should have known that THAT suit is well stopped|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh well|pg||
nt|gulyas: 11 tricks is not likely, was it not 10?|pg||
nt|don paulus: other room was @s lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  which looks very reasonable to me|pg||
nt|nulda: they play 1@h 14-20 5+|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|gulyas: we always have some wood in stock:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: EW can make 4@S|pg||
nt|chick: now there's one convention I really dislike|pg||
nt|gulyas: NS can save in 5@D, going for 300|pg||
nt|santyclz: 5@d?|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@C, 2@S, 2@h and 1@D|pg||
nt|garnetts: The same lead in the OR but South returned a club and failed to lead a third round|pg||
nt|elbec: 1nt is 12-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: oh, ok, sry|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|santyclz: Best kind of sac.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H presumably hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so 4NT for the minor|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@S just makes|pg||
nt|gulyas: and so does 5@C:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it looks as if it takes a diamond lead to beat 6@C|pg||
nt|gulyas: ouch|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  so maybe North is tempted to bid more than 3@H here?|pg||
nt|gulyas: these teams are currently 8th and 6th, respectively, so they are both in the heat of qualifying (top8 Qs)|pg||
nt|andyv:  W felt he had to do something but 5 card minor suit overcalls at 2 level rarely gain anything|pg||
mb|2H|nt|gulyas: 5@D would be sensible, it is almost certain that EW has a Vul game, and this will go for 300 max|pg||
nt|gulyas: this is when u gently lean over and ask 'no more @Cs, partner?':)|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S is very agressive--prefer double to show spades with at least tolerance for clubs|pg||
nt|don paulus: hard to stay out of game - all key cards wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: this is where your wk2 should show the best hand: 2nd seat, vul against not|pg||
mb|4H|nt|gulyas: I guess NS should sacrifice, all the way to 6@S:)|pg||
nt|april7: another 3NT but a litle more tricky|pg||
nt|gulyas: so even a 7 card suit is acceptable here |pg||
nt|cindy:  hi all|pg||
nt|jstokes: Hi Cindy|pg||
nt|gulyas: hi Cindy|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: N, with no defense whatsoever outside @Ss could go to 5@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will lead a club, surely....and be somewhat narked by the outcome|pg||
nt|april7: now its easier again for N|pg||
nt|gulyas: now he has 9 tricks|pg||
nt|gulyas: his suit lacks the intermediates, so its a soso overcall (with a passed pd, I would pass)|pg||
mb|p|nt|nulda: in CR 4spades made from EW|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, the so-called snapdragon double|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: I think N has still to find J of @S|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@H makes here too |pg||
nt|garnetts: They may well have this sorted but I would certainly have bid 4@S as East if my partner had bid 2@S|pg||
nt|elbec: yes|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gulyas: 3@C,3@D,2@H,1@S should be enough:)|pg||
nt|elbec: and defence is quite easy|pg||
pc|dT|nt|april7: he can finesse J of @C|pg||
nt|gulyas: same contract in the OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  in mp I might bid the hand... I just don't see it's value in imps esp. when vul|pg||
nt|gulyas: vul against not is very dangerous|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|gulyas: 4@S would have been 500, so it was a good call to let it go|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm conflicted about that, n having limited his hand with 1nt should usually leave such descisions to his pd, but this may be an exception.|pg||
nt|gulyas: E will take his 4 tops, thank you very much, and folds up soon after|pg||
nt|chick: must cash all tricks right now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|april7: E might develop10th trick by playing @S|pg||
nt|april7: but E will probably lead @D now|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|cherdano:  maybe North could have raised to 3@H right away|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @DJ looked a bit safer|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|nulda: W a bit two strong for 2s I suppose, 1s would be better|pg||
nt|cherdano:  to allow partner to bid 4 with extras|pg||
nt|santyclz: Unlucky might very well get out for -1 if played by s.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gulyas: E could have saved the day with a NF 2@H, but it could be wrong on other hands|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  W will do well to go -2 on this|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cherdano:  yes the heavy jump caused EW to miss game here|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl dummy, W cashes one more @S, switches to @h, and after 3 rounds, then leads @s|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|gulyas: nice suit pref by discarding the @HJ|pg||
nt|chick: true, but wasn't much other choice anyway :)|pg||
nt|elbec: 1 off|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jstokes: friendly club position prevents any problems for declarer here|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gulyas: yes, thats what I meant|pg||
nt|andyv:  good switch|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|gulyas: so Bob knew he could not open up a trick in @Cs|pg||
nt|gulyas: N could have had @CA and @SK in theory|pg||
nt|gulyas: and pd with @CKT|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|cherdano:  Ozgur, was 2@S explained as weak?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|gulyas: now @H ruff, and then the @S to promote another trump trick|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|andyv:  good d|pg||
nt|garnetts: It is 500 but not clear cut to double perhaps --can be a useful investment for a couple of imps if they go on and go off|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||

mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|april7: a @H partscore for EW,2@H and 3@D for NS|pg||

mb|4N!|nt|gulyas: I noticed that, just didn't know why|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|nt|nulda: 1d 11-20 nat or 15-17 bal|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Oliver Clarke|pg||

mb|p|nt|oliverc: Good morning everyone|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|jstokes: yes, with such a good fit, i agree|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cherdano:  i am corrected - team 42 also is transnational, with 4 different nationalities|pg||
nt|nulda: do not give an invitation to Macura, I know|pg||

pc|s6|nt|cherdano:  I kind of like 2NT|pg||
nt|cherdano:  with all those queens|pg||
nt|cherdano:  NT may well play better than hearts|pg||
nt|oliverc: well this contract will get everything it deserves|pg||
nt|gulyas: lead a trump and watch it fall apart|pg||
nt|april7: @H lead is best and E will go 2 down|pg||
nt|gulyas: asking for pd to bid 3NT with a @D stop|pg||
nt|andyv:  question of how to play the @CS... cash Ace first or dbl hook?|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: probably making - can engineer a club ruff in the West hand|pg||
nt|april7: then only 1 down, but canot make it|pg||
nt|gulyas: cashing the A is the safety play|pg||
nt|andyv:  this takes all the pressure off|pg||
nt|don paulus: @s for @h ?|pg||
nt|don paulus: 6 @s|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gulyas: really bad hand W has|pg||
nt|mdgraham: trump lead often best on these types of auction |pg||
nt|gulyas: as long as he doesn't put up the @CJ but ruffs out the Q, he can get home in 2@H (no trump lead)|pg||
nt|april7: but he is in 3@H|pg||
nt|gulyas: that will not make|pg||
nt|gulyas: the only excitement would have come from playing in 4@S, but that would have made as well|pg||
nt|andyv:  S might have dbld 3@s to suggest lead but his @Ss weren't terrific.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|gulyas: don't see why he should bid 1@D|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|gulyas: the good news is, now declarer has 8 tricks|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gulyas: he should have let the opps venture into 3-4@S and go down|pg||
nt|santyclz: It wouldn't have occurred to me.  1@s would have, but I would have resisted.|pg||
nt|gulyas: other room, a huge result for Australia|pg||
nt|gulyas: especially since 3@D is not making|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lead can't be right, that's what I would have led.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|garnetts: Yes--might have doubled 2@H to suggest a TOD without spades maybe--but very disciplined --K@D looks better to me |pg||
nt|gulyas: the bad news is, there will be no more|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: not the best of starts for the defence|pg||
nt|april7: but without a X its 2 imps save|pg||
nt|chick: lol|pg||
nt|gulyas: most ppl would have tried 1NT or 2@C there|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|gulyas: so a doubled overtrick is unexpected:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: over 1@H|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d7|pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gulyas: I would have led a @H, but that still would not have helped:)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gulyas: but with only a half stopper, and a really crummy 5c suit, I agree with the pass|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|santyclz: I'm of the old school that if an overcall doesn't take away any space it should be on full values.  The more space it takes away the less solid it has to be.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suspect that the double of 3@D was intended as take-out |pg||
nt|andyv:  claim time|pg||

mb|p|nt|april7: 4@S just making,5@C on trump lead 1 down|pg||
nt|april7: in 4@S E must find the J of @H though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South can get two ruffs, though|pg||
nt|april7: only 1|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would ruff out @Ds and make 5@C|pg||

nt|garnetts: North got in first lol|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@S look OK to me as South to keep hearts out|pg||
nt|jstokes: and here we have the worst possible 8-card suit|pg||
nt|jstokes: how many diamonds from west?|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|cherdano:  2@H probably shows 6 spades|pg||
nt|nulda: 1c 18-20 bal or 11+nat or 21+ anything|pg||
nt|oliverc: Well if EW are defending that poorly, South's decision to raise to game fully|pg||
nt|oliverc: justified, I suppose|pg||
nt|nulda: yes they play transfers in competitive bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  NS in the other room got pushed to 5@S|pg||
nt|cherdano:  after East jump-overcalled 2@H|pg||
nt|nulda: probably 4h from N|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @DA, @D ruff, @HA, @D ruff|pg||
nt|gulyas: you have the @C8 as an entry too:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but possibly academic as South might lead a top club against 4@S, if he let EW play it there|pg||
nt|april7: y 5@C can be made|pg||
nt|andyv:  N taking a very conservative approach with his hand|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he almost has din just in one suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: gin|pg||
nt|jstokes: and 4 great poker hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: three seems like an odd number of diamonds to bid|pg||
nt|elbec: i agree. |pg||
nt|elbec: another good result from italy|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|april7: so 5@S is a good save|pg||
nt|gulyas: now, that was 1000 away|pg||
nt|gulyas: his @S suit is really bad quality|pg||
nt|gulyas: but overall, a nice hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, but rest of hand quite excellent for 2@s opener|pg||
nt|gulyas: both 4@H and 4@S has merit, but they are not making on the actual layout |pg||
nt|garnetts: I wonder what the double of 2NT meant|pg||
nt|gulyas: but NS has to find the immediate @C ruff to beat it|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not at all clear to bid if you ask me |pg||
nt|gulyas: and EW needs the @D ruff to beat 4@S, more or less|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it does provide for E having a big onesuiter of his own, but then W hand is not likely to be too useful|pg||
nt|jstokes: he may be worried that partner has a big one-suiter (and therefore, possibly short diamonds)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: see my last remark|pg||
nt|elbec: in open room|pg||
nt|rgdruru: they can make 7nt|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|gulyas: and 12 to CKIS |pg||
mb|p|nt|nulda: another chance for NS to stop in game|pg||
nt|gulyas: 5@C a real sacrifice this time|pg||
nt|chick: sad|pg||
nt|gulyas: an agressive t/o dbl over 2NT I would think|pg||
nt|gulyas: found the right hand with pd|pg||
mb|3H|nt|oliverc: ...and will probably make 11 tricks, too, just to rub salt in the wounds|pg||
nt|nulda: 5s from N hand should be make|pg||
nt|cherdano:  North decided 4@S was enough - with the added benefit of protecting his @HAQ on the lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: if he had a decent @S suit (say, KT98 instead of K765), I would agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 5@S makes on the trump finesse|pg||

nt|oliverc: that would make sense|pg||
nt|elbec: nice contract bid (and doubled) here|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|gulyas: 5@Cx will go 2 down most likely|pg||
nt|gulyas: unless N decides to do something foolish:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice 5@C bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@S is not a good save. 800 on best defence|pg||
nt|gulyas: N thought S had a great hand, whereas he was just running with his 7 carder and nothing else|pg||
nt|elbec: it's true|pg||
mb|4C|nt|santyclz: Lawful 20 tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: franchý called director|pg||
nt|gulyas: S was not so sure, so he pulled |pg||
nt|garnetts: Can hardly be anyhting else--you know this 2NT bid led to this--why bother with it |pg||
nt|gulyas: N could think that after 2NT, this is a forcing situation|pg||
nt|oliverc: muddying the waters, perhaps|pg||
nt|gulyas: so then x is just weakness|pg||
nt|gulyas: but S could clearly see that N is probably very short in @Cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and another imp for the Greek team|pg||
nt|gulyas: actually 6@D is not a bad contract from the right side|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't get rid of the clubs|pg||
nt|gulyas: discard it on the @Hs|pg||
nt|andyv:  now he can|pg||
nt|gulyas: we will see if 4@S will be beat|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not keen on the double without a trump trick and without an expectation that 4H would make|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|nulda: in CR 5s was played from S hand, so one down|pg||
nt|gulyas: now overtake with the A, return a @S...|pg||
nt|gulyas: double fit is always extra|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South can't know that North has six diamonds, but overtaking was possible. Not likely to lead from Kx against this auction |pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, had to open my eyes:)|pg||
nt|rgdruru: 6@h for meckstroth i think|pg||
mb|5D|nt|vugraphzur: litte break|pg||
nt|cherdano:  probably a good idea for EW|pg||
nt|cherdano:  of course EW don't take any blame for the loss on this board - their teammates taking the push to 5@S was the costly decision|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|chick: I say never redouble a slam.  (unless you have 13 spades)  The opponents are nuts to double unless they have something you don't expect (and I never assume the opps are nuts) :)|pg||
nt|ritong: at least they know who will offer the drinks when they are qualified|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: as long as N doesn't want to play a hero, they will have their 4 tricks|pg||
nt|gulyas: oops|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Henri :)|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Salut Henri.|pg||
nt|gulyas: that helps:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  so it's a push|pg||
nt|oliverc: Franchi may well not find the Diamond lead, but Paparo should surely find the switch|pg||
nt|oliverc: at trick 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: I meant 5@H|pg||
nt|gulyas: 800 doesn't sound like a good save:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  almost 1am here:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, with trumps 3-0, he may not be able to take all the tricks he wants|pg||
nt|gulyas: has to take the @S finesse as well|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2dik|pg||
nt|andyv:  he should be ok...@s hook is marked and even if it loses no problem|pg||
nt|gulyas: oops, sry|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|gulyas: well, sometimes they ARE nuts and you have to punish them, but it is not too often|pg||
nt|oliverc: wd|pg||
nt|elbec: best lead for manno|pg||
nt|don paulus: will be a relief to see stiff K @h|pg||
nt|elbec: rodrigo what is the best line in your opinion?|pg||
nt|murat e: declarer worried now but soon he will be happy unless he plays heart jack from dummy|pg||
nt|elbec: not if he plays jack of hearts :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not unreasonable to play East for K10x|pg||
nt|don paulus: well ... if he does not have the 10 ...|pg||
nt|elbec: but he should start with 9 of @h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: who would cover that from K10x?|pg||
nt|elbec: nobody|pg||
nt|elbec: but it would be a nice move|pg||
nt|elbec: to play king with k10x|pg||
nt|elbec: delete my last sentence|pg||
nt|elbec: :)|pg||
nt|elbec: too hot here :D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Try F6|pg||
nt|elbec: :)|pg||
nt|elbec: nice|pg||
nt|Walddk4: then you get a blank screen|pg||
nt|unclejohn: if he's SURE @CK offside, the !A, @H to Q, hope for @HK onside and either friendly @Hs or 3-3 @S and 4-3 @S|pg||
nt|unclejohn: @HA|pg||
nt|murat e: practically club finesse is useless w not expected to underlead fm king of clubs to the strong hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Bart Bramley|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|gulyas: that was silly|pg||
nt|gulyas: right, he can see pd has 1 @D max|pg||
nt|cindy:  no and they would have been in real trouble if it gets sent back|pg||
pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: it is true that it rates to go down, but 300 is not going to happen all that often, and 100 is not worth much versus 50|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chick: lol kibs are saying it's no fun unless you punish the double :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: quite|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chick: it's 100% true, bridge is supposed to be fun :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gulyas: once my pd redbled a slam to make me concentrate more on declarer play:) the opps led the suit that would set me, but then failed to cash their winner and I made with a squeeze:)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gulyas: he may even be able to crossruff his way home|pg||
nt|andyv:  he plans to xruff everything now|pg||
nt|oliverc: incisive defence, nicely done|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|gulyas: so, yes, bridge can be fun a lot of times|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: fay claims before darkadakis play|pg||
nt|unclejohn: i mean 3-3@Ds and 4-3 @Ss, then can pitch both clubs|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|gulyas: those @S tricks were not going anywhere|pg||
nt|garnetts: good 8@H to ask for a @D --but was perhqaps obvious |pg||
nt|oliverc: once dummy went down, yes|pg||
nt|gulyas: so thats 5 to Italy Red|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is actually very good stuff being played here on the whole|pg||
nt|oliverc: Do we know why the Director was called?|pg||
nt|garnetts: To get the result changed to 4@H going off? :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@Hx-2?:)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|santyclz: Doubled slams aren't enough to get you to concentrate?|pg||
nt|chick: XX's certainly make it more exciting :)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d2|nt|gulyas: he is lucky S has a @H trick|pg||
nt|gulyas: I was very young then:)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: Hmm. The opposition have ten diamonds - North has spades - surely South had to be long in hearts|pg||

nt|cindy:  hi marshall :)|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|andyv:  a disaster in the OR on this board|pg||
nt|gulyas: a grand bid and made in the OR|pg||
nt|gulyas: lets see how they fare here|pg||
nt|elbec: something like 15 tricks here :)|pg||
nt|elbec: maybe only 14 :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: only 14, no squeeze|pg||
nt|cindy:  15 is something like 14 :)|pg||
nt|elbec: 12-14|pg||
mb|d!|nt|oliverc: easy major suit game here|pg||
mb|r|nt|santyclz: As Martin Johnson points out, though, a @h at the end would have saved a trick.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=12  for standings after 12 rounds. Top 8 after this round advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: tomorrow|pg||
nt|andyv:  N tried to sign off in 3@d after a strong @c opener but S continued to 3N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: esp for 1NT|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|nulda: 2c both majors 44, 6-13 points|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d lead to prevent @c ruff|pg||
nt|gulyas: 1@D will not go 5 down, I am sure:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: can overbid it maybe|pg||
nt|oliverc: maybe they can get too high|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes :)|pg||
nt|don paulus: W pass or 2 nt ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|nulda: 2d relay|pg||
nt|cherdano:  6-13, quite a wide range!|pg||
nt|andyv:  7 tricks in the bank now|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: two eminently sensible auctions|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: both 2@H and 3@D makes|pg||
nt|april7: on a first round @H finesse S can make now 10 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would anyonbe open 2C with S hand? i would|pg||
mb|p|nt|nulda: 1st and 2nd hand a bit better (written in their CC)|pg||
nt|santyclz: A bad hand for the weak nt.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=10  for standings after 10 rounds. First 8 after 13 rounds advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: tomorrow|pg||
nt|andyv:  and a new leader|pg||
nt|oliverc: plenty of scope for West to fall in love with their hand|pg||
nt|cindy:  not sure|pg||
nt|gulyas: its a great 22|pg||
nt|cindy:  it is true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: cant rebid satisfactorily after 1D|pg||
nt|cindy:  are they playing step responses ?|pg||
nt|jstokes: very hard to show the minors after a 2@C opening; great hand, though and will be hard to identify 13+ tricks after this start|pg||
nt|cindy:  no problem getting to 7 with 2@C and steps|pg||
nt|gulyas: if you play control responses, it takes 2 bids to get to grand:)|pg||
nt|cindy:  not sure you need to worry about the @c suit|pg||
nt|cindy:  yep|pg||
nt|marlowepi: its not the point count, its the fact that you can make 3N opposite many hands that will pass, and you cant rebid adequately after 1D|pg||
nt|cindy:  im sure now, marshall.  yes, just treating it as a one suiter|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont see the problem in showing the minors. 3D shows diamonds, and clubs are probably not important|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: The @d fit remained undisclosed.|pg||
nt|gulyas: this looks more like 8 tricks|pg||
nt|elbec: they should play inverted double...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|elbec: what do you think about 4@d bid?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the case for 1D would be stronger if there were a way to rebid that put the minors in proper perspectiuve, but there isnt|pg||
nt|cindy:  i think it is fine|pg||
nt|cindy:  they are in a game force and 4@d describes hand imo|pg||
nt|unclejohn: in theory he's off only 2 trumps and 3 side aces, but there are just a few "handling charges" - down 2 more likely|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|nulda: 2s minimum, 5 cards|pg||
nt|andyv:  8 for sure, mayb be 9 with 2 spade pitches|pg||
nt|jstokes: what else other than 4@D|pg||
nt|elbec: here they are|pg||
nt|jstokes: here they are in slam, but grand seems difficult to me on this auction|pg||
nt|jstokes: unless Fay just bids it|pg||
nt|elbec: he will bid it|pg||
nt|elbec: he has lots of extra values|pg||
nt|elbec: all @d high trumps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, i dont know about that "what else besides 4D?"  3N might be the last makeable game. N hasnt promised much at all at that point, and 3S just says "can u bid 3N?"|pg||
nt|elbec: kq of spades|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|murat e: interesting play 5 obvious tricks for the defence and sixth will come from somewhwer or not....|pg||
nt|elbec: let's see what happens|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cherdano:  i am surprised North didnt try for game|pg||
nt|oliverc: ...and no fairytale if they do, since North has the wrong singleton @H honour|pg||
nt|elbec: i don't like 6nt here...|pg||
nt|cindy:  was 5N pick a slam ?|pg||
nt|jstokes: I assume it was pick a slam -- would he bid it with the queen of clubs instead of the king?|pg||
nt|elbec: 5nt asks for high trumps, Josephine style|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|cherdano:  oh i see 2s showed a minimum|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@D, 2@S, 2@C|pg||
nt|andyv:  yeap|pg||
nt|gulyas: they may get too high now|pg||
nt|oliverc: no. should stop there|pg||
nt|cindy:  i dont think so elbec|pg||
nt|gulyas: somebody should have blackwooded here...|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: 5nt was pick a slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N could easily have:  xxx   Axxxx   9x  Qxx. now 3N is stone cold but you have to guess to make 5C|pg||
nt|don paulus: interesting @d position|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|nulda: Michal has to have good brakes to stop in 2|pg||
nt|oliverc: (5@H)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gulyas: you should use the 6c keycard bw here|pg||
nt|oliverc: or 5@S|pg||
nt|garnetts: they must take the A@D |pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|oliverc: apparently 7@S in the other room|pg||
nt|gulyas: 7??|pg||
nt|oliverc: so I'm told|pg||
nt|garnetts: North may not see it that way|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s8|nt|gulyas: this is going down a lot now|pg||
nt|gulyas: I guess they don't use BW at all|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, with a @S lead, this is going down a lot|pg||
nt|garnetts: Hadn't noticed the South void--lightner comes into play|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gulyas: but it was brave from N to come in with that hand after 1NT|pg||
nt|unclejohn: i'm revising to down 1, and might actually make now with a winning @D guess|pg||
pc|d6|nt|nulda: so another swing to Japan-Czech team, well done up to now|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh-oh|pg||
nt|garnetts: can switch to spades though--6@S |pg||
nt|gulyas: but didn't|pg||
nt|gulyas: now this will be 500|pg||
nt|oliverc: Any feelings on 6@H by East after West's sign-off?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes--crazy|pg||
nt|gulyas: agree:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: he just liked his 3 aces too much|pg||
nt|oliverc: unforgiveable, I feel|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|gulyas: showing his A9xxx as a suit to play...|pg||
nt|gulyas: will N find the @S lead? should not be too hard|pg||
nt|gulyas: doh|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gulyas: 6 more to Italy Red|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|cherdano:  West would have done better to start with the @DK, rather than a low @D|pg||
nt|gulyas: now the @DJ to ask for a @S?|pg||
nt|gulyas: hmm|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, still 2 down if he gets his ruff|pg||
nt|murat e: w must play ace and small club..|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|unclejohn: that play should mark the red aces with east|pg||
nt|murat e: a cunning move to recover..|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|unclejohn: east's @D shift strongly suggests his actual holding - why else break the suit?|pg||
nt|murat e: again it shows us that doubling opponents in two of a major is not reccomended|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gulyas: maybe the juniors don't smoke any more, or use matches:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: 5@H would likely go off too then --oddly no one doubled 7@S so they will gain for that if it goes 2 off---strange game|pg||
nt|gulyas: I mean really, what was N thinking??|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not thinking I imagine|pg||
nt|gulyas: he is lucky it goes down at all|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cherdano:  so his partner can win the second diamond|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2 down, which is not too bad since EW can make a few overtricks in @H partials|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|cherdano:  and play a club through|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, 8 to the Greek, leading 10-8 now|pg||
nt|garnetts: I knew once i said the bridge was good--this little exhibit comes along lol|pg||
nt|don paulus: as it intended as penalty ?|pg||
nt|murat e: ý think now he counted points and will know dia ace w east|pg||
nt|don paulus: was|pg||
nt|elbec: they play reverse double|pg||
nt|elbec: so manno's double wasn't penalty|pg||
pc|cT|nt|oliverc: the trump promo still there, though|pg||
nt|chick: down 2 not vul is a decent result|pg||
nt|gulyas: I hate to say this, but I did not agree then either:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: S could have helped with the @DJ|pg||
nt|garnetts: flat board|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes|pg||
nt|gulyas: but he thought the @S ruff was obvious|pg||
nt|gulyas: so did we|pg||
nt|oliverc: clearly not obvious enough|pg||
nt|garnetts: both sides richly rewarded for their efforts|pg||
nt|gulyas: only person not sure was N...|pg||
nt|gulyas: agree, neither team deserved anything for their showing on this hand|pg||
nt|oliverc: Is West really going to bid 3@S with KQ stiff?|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: n seemed unhappy about @D 2|pg||
nt|unclejohn: @C8 will be key to keeping control|pg||
nt|murat e: takinh heart ace was another error|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|cherdano:  yes but they needed two trump promotions :)|pg||

nt|santyclz: Enjoy, Daniel.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|murat e: otherwise north has to throw dia king under the ace|pg||

nt|santyclz: Technically he should cash @da first as he can handle !j10xx in s but not in n.  Entry problems might have precluded it anyway.|pg||
nt|gulyas: 10 tricks and an IMP|pg||
nt|gulyas: how many boards is the QF? 2x14?|pg||
nt|andyv:  i think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: 14 boards 2 rounds|pg||
nt|gulyas: he should have LED the @S10 for crying out loud!|pg||
nt|cindy:  other table got to 7 after 1@d and 13 bids|pg||
nt|jstokes: two well earned gains for Italy|pg||
nt|cavendish: @H|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|cherdano:  (ruff and overruff, diamond ruffed by partner's ace, and another club)|pg||
nt|chick: Roland, how should they choose?  Pick a weak team to better the chances for a win,  or pick a strong team to play while they are fresher?  :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: absolutely|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: another wk balanced hand opened - are we getting too old?:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: regrettably, yes|pg||
nt|santyclz: Perhaps, but it beats the alternative.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Over/under on this hand 4@h?|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
nt|cindy:  so defintely 2@c and controls saves a lot of anguish to bid an easy grand|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: it does seem to be the modern style to open balanced 11-counts |pg||
nt|andyv:  a sparse 11 count but 3-3 in majors make it a marginal opener|pg||
nt|elbec: 1@c shows any GF or 15-17 balanced or 15+ with 4+@c|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, though that is not what one is thinking when one decides to open 2C onm the hand :)|pg||
nt|don paulus: what's wrong with 3 nt ?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|cherdano:  how strong is 2@D?|pg||
nt|gulyas: I can see opening wk hands with distribution opened, I do that sometimes too, but a balanced 11 count...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Of course at their age I was playing "western rabbit" in which all 10hcp hands were mandatory openers.|pg||
nt|gulyas: these are the hands where you can get VERY frustrated with pd|pg||
nt|jstokes: 2@S likely shows diamonds and a decent hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it would not enter my mind to pass the W hand. but if 2D is multi and 1D doesnt even show Ds, i guess it is ok|pg||
nt|cindy:  no but arent you happy when after the second bid you know about the major suit aces and the club king|pg||
nt|jstokes: more than happy, Cindy :)|pg||
nt|cindy:  agree   looks like an opening hand to me too|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: manno called director|pg||
nt|elbec: 1d shows diamonds|pg||
nt|elbec: or balanced 18-19|pg||
nt|elbec: no sorry|pg||
nt|elbec: 1@d is 4+@d 11-21|pg||
nt|cindy:  2@s showing @d i guess|pg||
nt|elbec: yes|pg||
mb|3N|nt|nulda: oh|pg||
nt|oliverc: Good grief|pg||
nt|nulda: 2d multi|pg||
nt|oliverc: this is turning into an utter disaster for the Metherlands|pg||
nt|oliverc: Netherlands|pg||
nt|nulda: looks like 25 : -25 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: astonishing final pass by american E on  5 with 19 HCP and a partner who has jumped in response to a TO douuble|pg||
nt|marlowepi: about as astonishing as pass by N over 2S here|pg||
nt|don paulus: slam try ?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mdgraham: the problem comes when partner plays you for full values -  see for example board 12|pg||
nt|gulyas: right, pd will raise u to game with 12 counts, and will go down|pg||
nt|gulyas: 170 in the OR|pg||
nt|gulyas: not the best defense there|pg||
nt|oliverc: All the EW pairs there will be breathing a sigh of relief to get out with a push|pg||
nt|garnetts: This one is fairly normal--little to be said about it|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  lol  yes to both|pg||
nt|elbec: now 3@s should be @s stop|pg||
nt|cindy:  a double would be nice now|pg||
nt|cindy:  at least|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S is going to offer to take Michaels off the card if N is going to pass on this hand when S uses it|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: this could make, 4@S+2@D tricks to start with|pg||
nt|fabsayc: one step at a time, i think, 1-4 get to choose from 5-8|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting treatment by W|pg||
nt|unclejohn: meck doesn't have any extra really|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I would have passed|pg||
nt|gulyas: almost identical bidding here to the OR|pg||
nt|gulyas: 8tricks is the limit I would say|pg||
nt|garnetts: The defnec need to steer clear of @D's to hold it to the least number of tricks|pg||
nt|cindy:  wow|pg||
nt|elbec: maybe he knows that only a @h lead sets 6@c!|pg||
nt|murat e: they need to bid and make slam here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|murat e: need to....|pg||
nt|unclejohn: can't make slam - this is the best they could do|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gulyas: a @C trick will develop eventually|pg||
nt|mdgraham: did West really overcall 1NT in the Open Room? That seems remarkable|pg||
nt|rgdruru: they can make 6 with this lead|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cindy:  N's mouth and fingers stapled shut no doubt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for all he know (over 2S) the hand belonged to NS in 4S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or eys|pg||
nt|marlowepi: italy has crushed foe after foe in this event. you aint going to beat them with the green card|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|elbec: will end with all the tricks since he can't make club finesse|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|gulyas: declarer has to get the @Ds right to even make this|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|april7: defence should make 6 tricks only|pg||
nt|gulyas: here is the 7th trick|pg||
nt|april7: no|pg||
nt|april7: for NS or EW???|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, has to take the @D finesse still|pg||
nt|gulyas: I mean for declarer|pg||
nt|april7: yes|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|gulyas: declarer will end up with an extra overtrick or 2 here|pg||
nt|andyv:  nothing prevents E from being 3-3-2-5 on this hand and, with a 10 count little reason to use garbage stayman|pg||
nt|elbec: not now|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|cT|nt|chick: I don't think S should spend the @HA yet?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: as pointed out, the 4th team does not really choose, they get whoever is left of 5-8|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||
nt|nulda: a towel into the ring|pg||
nt|nulda: the Czech Team has a couch from Netherlands - Ine Gielkens, former woman representative of Netherlands|pg||
nt|chick: pitch the club and get some club ruffs with the smaller trumps|pg||
pc|d9|nt|gulyas: by NOT playing a @D to the K|pg||
nt|unclejohn: slam is anti-percentage, need @C finesse AND @H guess|pg||
pc|s4|nt|april7: don't forget the @D finesse|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|gulyas: he is on the right track...|pg||

nt|gulyas: 'hey guys, I made a tough 2@S on bd23' - 'yeah, 2 for them'|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|oliverc: difficult to construct a line of play that yields 10 tricks for NS. A@D and then the 10@D|pg||
nt|oliverc: from East?|pg||

nt|frankaus: i find the method works|pg||
nt|gulyas: N making lots of overtricks in 1NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: carryover would not work, since the qualifying is not a complete round robin|pg||
nt|gulyas: doh, @H lead, low, K...|pg||
nt|oliverc: oh a small @H to the KING at trick 1. that'll help. now no Club loser|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|mdgraham: sory all, I have to go. Enjoy the rest of the session.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|nulda: 1h 14-20 5+h|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, 9 tricks from top|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  now here we have a bad slam that would make|pg||
nt|cherdano:  with 6@S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|april7: 1@S -1NT 2@H  2@S 3@H???|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: against a possibly short club, it is debatable was the 2@C cue is - it can be played as natural. |pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: but S passed already, so no 3@H anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|nulda: in GF now|pg||
nt|oliverc: If NS bid to 3NT on  4, expect them to get to 6@S here :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, you need to have SOME sort of a forcing bid|pg||
nt|santyclz: Agree with 2@c, but should then backpedal.|pg||
nt|april7: but S would have made 3 @H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: incidentally a heart lead probably does not set slam on the previous hand---in fact E rates to make all 13 tricks on that lead|pg||
nt|murat e: other match is very close now and here the american team desperately needs something good|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  identical auction|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@H would be 500, so well done both sides|pg||
nt|andyv:  play will be over at trick 1|pg||
nt|garnetts: pretty standard 1NT contract here |pg||
nt|gulyas: I have seen worse 3NT attempted here:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I absolutely loath that 1@S rebid--saw it in action recently and they played 2@c ON A 3-3 FIT|pg||
nt|gulyas: 1NT should be his rebid|pg||
nt|elbec: looking at open room results, us could apparently gain something only on the last 4@s|pg||
nt|elbec: but you never know|pg||
nt|rogerclee: not true, 25 and 26 are possible partial swings|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: However having a general cue-bid available is a good idea, so even against short clubs 2@C is useful as a cue  |pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/VGData/minirama.html  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|unclejohn: a string of plus scores keeps the pressure on|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|nulda: splinter bid|pg||
nt|nulda: cue-bid|pg||
nt|cherdano:  the 4@C cuebid should make south put on the brakes|pg||
pc|d7|nt|oliverc: no sign of that LOL|pg||
nt|elbec: not easy to make 10 tricks here|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|gulyas: so, no matter how short 1@C can be, 2@C should always be a cue|pg||
nt|garnetts: What happens with the East hand when they play 1NT losing the first five or six diamonds with 5@C laydown|pg||
nt|jstokes: 3NT would be much easier|pg||
nt|jstokes: at least with clubs breaking -- maybe 3NT not so great on club lead|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cherdano:  if he can read it as shortness|pg||
nt|ritong: for our possibly unaware specs, "carryover" is a part of the acquired score in qualifications when you play the same team again|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|nulda: S has no brakes, as u should have seen before|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1nt rebid 18-19 range|pg||
nt|santyclz: Uh oh, wheels fell off in the open room.|pg||
nt|chick: a big swing for SKAWINA if they make this|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gulyas: this a good example of not having the same wavelength abt the values in overcall|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|cherdano:  but now he will find out about the missing keycard and queen|pg||
nt|gulyas: if its OK to overcall with the S hand, N should not bid more than 2@C followed by 2@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: Agree 100%, Daniel.|pg||
nt|gulyas: now he is going down a lot|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. homework failure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North obviously took 2@D as showing a full value overcall|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gulyas: another homework problem there|pg||
nt|chick: and they should|pg||
nt|gulyas: it depends how violent West is:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2NT would be a reasonable gamble by S on the second round|pg||
nt|marlowepi: better with ten of hearts obviouly|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|nulda: 2 out of 5 without the Q, even S found the brake pedal|pg||
nt|cherdano:  but maybe it is rather North who bid too much here|pg||
nt|cherdano:  he is minimum in their style, has a void in partner's suit|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cherdano:  and made two cuebids after a reverse|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=9  for standings after 9 rounds. First 8 after 13 rounds advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: tomorrow|pg||
nt|cherdano:  this is a bit of speculation of course as we don't know their exact agreement|pg||
nt|nulda: so 3 more RR matches in the afternoon|pg||
nt|gulyas: since N could be any strong hand, all S showed was his pattern, not his overall strength|pg||
pc|c7|nt|cherdano:  5@S is already uncomfortably high|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is, but cards are very friendly|pg||
nt|cherdano:  how would you play it though? any 4-1 trump break is dangerous|pg||
nt|oliverc: You're asking the wrong person  -  Roland would be in 7 here LOL|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Win the club, cash two top spades ending in hand. If no queen, work with hearts. If West has four trumps I am still ok. Can't do anything if East has Q10xx anyway|pg||
nt|oliverc: sounds right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unblock @HQ first of course|pg||
nt|cherdano:  you still run into problems with spades 4-1 onside i think roland|pg||
nt|cherdano:  say you ruff a heart,how you dont have an entry back to hand|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i think you should play @DK earlier|pg||
nt|cherdano:  to set up a diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't I lead a spade up later? Requires that West has four hearts along with four trumps|pg||
nt|april7: N gets an uppercut in @S now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: how to make now?|pg||
nt|chick: start by winning the spade lead :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|santyclz: Every journey...|pg||
pc|c9|nt|cherdano:  seems better to knock out @DA earlier, to get the @DQ as entry back to hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|april7: tricky now,@S King and @C J discrding the @H loser|pg||
nt|april7: or overruffing and discarding later|pg||

mb|1S|mb|d|nt|april7: lucky distribution for 10 tricks in @H for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  USA Blue might lose a few on this unless they find the slam|pg||
nt|garnetts: This a a very acceptable slam--may not be that easy to reach though|pg||
nt|cindy:  2@h anyone ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has only green cards in his box|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|gulyas: yes, slam makes with good breaks, but its almost impossible to bid|pg||
nt|oliverc: difficult to reach, I feel|pg||
nt|marlowepi: guessing his first name is Anthony|pg||
nt|cindy:  :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|oliverc: wlle that nearly counts as a game swing to the Netherlands|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Last board now. Thanks to Hüseyin, Arend, Oliver and Vladimir|pg||
nt|marlowepi: (a reference to Brother Anthony in the monastery series by Bird)|pg||
nt|elbec: so on the last heart, if west discard a spade, hand is finished. if west discards a club, declarer play ace of club and club and endplay east with diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i always thought they shd be yellow|pg||
nt|elbec: so he has to discard a diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: 9 or 10 Boards?|pg||

mb|p|nt|gulyas: Namyats, not my fav convention, to put it mildly:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Unenterprising with trump support and controls in all side suits (depending on what 4@d shows).|pg||
nt|andyv:  time for N to retire|pg||
nt|gulyas: lev5 is for the opps|pg||
nt|cindy:  green = go   yeh  yellow seems more logical|pg||
nt|jstokes: but he still has one diamond, doesn't he, and that is all he needs|pg||
nt|elbec: and so he plays ace of diamonds and diamonds|pg||
nt|elbec: and 10 of diamonds is good now|pg||
nt|elbec: and he discards a spade|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then S pulls another trump from his discard pile|pg||
nt|elbec: discarding a club from the dummy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes ten of D is good, but E has it|pg||
nt|elbec: if west discard a diamond|pg||

nt|fabsayc: priority is best game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: since neither has made forcing bids|pg||
nt|gulyas: totally flat hand, even 4@S was too high as we could see in the OR|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|cherdano:  except for this lead!|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|oliverc: freely cue-bidding 1st or second round controls|pg||

pc|cT|pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: lovely double by drijver|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@C showing the first round control would leave South thinking his partner has little in the way of wasted spade values|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|andyv:  he saw the white, not the 1100|pg||
nt|garnetts: I do not think that 4NT here should be blackwood|pg||
nt|oliverc: wow|pg||
nt|garnetts: If North bid the grand it might even make on the A@S lead|pg||
nt|oliverc: naive to lead the A@S after the 4@S bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have been told 4NT is blackwood--which doesn't shock me--just that it is a poor use of the bid in this auction |pg||
nt|gulyas: what is N thinking abt?|pg||
nt|gulyas: he really has nothing extra|pg||
nt|murat e: but north having 5-5 in the blacks decided to block opp red suit bids and bid 3 spades|pg||
pc|d2|nt|nulda: E must try the king|pg||

nt|oliverc: Thanks all. I have to go|pg||
pc|d4|pg||

pc|s4|nt|gulyas: I did not like the 4@S, but nv vs vul, I can see that - 5@S is unheard of|pg||

nt|don paulus: 1 off also ?|pg||

pc|c6|nt|ritong: out of the schneider, but very painful anyway|pg||

mb|d|mb|2H|nt|nulda: 2 spades from NS|pg||

nt|cherdano:  3@D is a good preempt here with 3-1 in the majors|pg||
nt|nulda: but 3d should go down too|pg||
nt|oliverc: but we said that about the 3NT, nulda|pg||

nt|murat e: only a spade lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 9 corrected to 12 tricks|pg||

nt|andyv:  they can make 3@d|pg||

nt|andyv:  who?|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, off 5 tops, but almost:)|pg||

mb|p|pc|d3|nt|nulda: 3d one down I would bet|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Transfer to 4@H|pg||
nt|gulyas: has to get @Ss right to make 3@D|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: There are two sequences possible. 1N-4@C-4@H and 1N-2@D-2@H-4@H.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Unless the latter is a slam try.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: partnerships can have fun deciding which sequence means what|pg||
nt|gulyas: the latter shows some slam interest in my book|pg||
nt|murat e: north took sp king cashed club ace then strangely played another club|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sunit: 88/91 now|pg||
nt|april7: hi, but would you like to be in 7NT? 6 @C is enough, but they will also play 6@H like in OR|pg||
nt|josj: nope...|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, 7 is for hands you want to make the newpaper column on|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ritong: reasonable action from macura|pg||
nt|andyv:  bidding should help there|pg||
nt|gulyas: interesting, with AK and AKQ in 2 suits, W leads - a trump:)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|santyclz: Killing lead.|pg||
nt|josj: that's why I hope someone will bid 7 :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and the double of 6@H too for that matter|pg||
nt|gulyas: a nice triple squeeze really|pg||
nt|gulyas: that double is uncalled for|pg||
nt|april7: S should not X, they might run to NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl of 6@h in OR seemed suicidal, but neither W or E budged...almost like a deer caught in the headlights|pg||
nt|murat e: and contract was made|pg||
pc|s4|nt|april7: yes, absolutely|pg||
nt|Walddk4: same happened in the other match|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6@C in one room, 6@HX in the other|pg||
nt|april7: but will E pass 6@C???|pg||
nt|andyv:  missing a control, W may opt for 6@c |pg||
nt|april7: he really should!!!|pg||
nt|april7: Q of @C a very big card!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@S is a convenient response to RKCK. 2 aces and trump queen. He has that whether hearts or clubs are trumps :)|pg||
nt|april7: decisive board!!|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cherdano:  yes first three tricks|pg||
nt|april7: W might opt for 6NT?|pg||
nt|mildredb: :)  didn't know there was a Mildred!  |pg||
nt|andyv:  W hasn't shown any support for @hs... time for E to reevaluate the Q@c|pg||
nt|april7: is 5NT a proposition to play?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=11  for standings after 11 rounds. First 8 after 13 rounds advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: tomorrow. One more round of Swiss after this, in about 30 minutes|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, sounds more like we have all the controls|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|cherdano:  and @DAQ|pg||
nt|oliverc: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=9|pg||
nt|nulda: so 5 more Imps to J-C theam|pg||
pc|s2|nt|april7: then they might play 7NT , but W knows a control is missing|pg||
nt|nickd: no, after club jump ace asking is with @c suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, RKC was for @cs here|pg||
nt|andyv:  and E shows the k@s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh well, goodbye to 6@C and 6@H. I think the Greeks stop in 6NT|pg||
nt|april7: then 7NT is possible and a good player will make it|pg||
nt|gulyas: or 7@C:)|pg||
nt|ritong: @c to the 9?|pg||
nt|don paulus: this smells like they want a ruff :)|pg||
nt|murat e: declarer in dilemna|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cherdano:  hi Henri!|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|gulyas: how do you know? even if W has those above mentioned honors, cannot E have the @SQ? he would still pass all the way|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|nulda: 64-1 and 25-0|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cindy:  blue needed that|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ritong: he accepts to pay double partscore swing, knowing he has a good score sheet, and if 4@s is on, pard will probably bid again|pg||
nt|nickd: well at least 5 imps for greek team:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: S not happy, he wanted a @H contract:)|pg||
nt|ritong: of course|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andyv:  now we can see how well declarer plays this... S can be squeezed in the majors|pg||
nt|gulyas: and after you find out his 6@H, 3@D, and at least 2@C cards, I am not sure you will get it right...|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, declarer will soon now W's distribution, so he may go for the 4-2 odds on the @sQ|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks all, back in 1 hour and a wee bit. Enjoy your breakfast, lunch, dinner, nightcap, whatever|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, he avoids a big accident|pg||
nt|cherdano:  you would pass and jump to 4@S over a reopening double?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: in that specific context|pg||
nt|nulda: I have to go to work unfortunately in the afternoon, so good luck for the Czech juniors :)|pg||
nt|ritong: otherwise, i bid my hand with 3@s|pg||
nt|nulda: it would be nice to see them in the play-off|pg||
nt|cherdano:  they are on their way Vladimir!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are almost there already|pg||
nt|ritong: they will|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|nulda: I hope so|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You don't think he will make it, Nikos?|pg||

nt|gulyas: but now, that he left the @Hs intact, he could have been endplayed by playing a @H up from hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|garnetts: I don't like like light openings in first and second seat but I would open here as west|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|nt|gulyas: with only @Hs and @Ss left, he would have had to give a @H trick or open up @Ss|pg||

nt|gulyas: 2@C?? why not 3 or 4?|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@C seems righ on the East tickets to me|pg||

nt|gulyas: anybody who plays ghestem should be shot:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would rather psyche 1NT than bid 2@C |pg||
nt|marlowepi: better for W to pass, as is usually the case when preempt hand faces strong bal;anced|pg||
nt|ritong: really?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|nt|andyv:  3@h must be non forcing |pg||
nt|gulyas: probably|pg||
nt|andyv:  it certainly isn't pretty:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: I have not heard of a sys that lets you do that, but I may be too young:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@C might be Ghestem or some other vile convention|pg||
nt|gulyas: if somebody stole my 3@C bid, I would rather bid 4@C than 2|pg||

nt|gulyas: draw trumps and play @Ds?|pg||
nt|andyv:  have to|pg||
nt|garnetts: what is the point of 2@D?  If you must bid then 2@H surely|pg||
nt|gulyas: I mean, what more do you need? a good, semi-solid 7c suit, nothing outside... doesn't that scream PREEMPT?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for me availability of mnulti has no bearing on this. 3S or pass, and i vote for pass. |pg||
nt|vugraphzur: 3@D :singleton in a minor|pg||
nt|ritong: they will probably fall back on their feet|pg||
nt|don paulus: great job Ozgur as this is 1st time we notice you are there :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|gulyas: if that is trouble, I am willing to do that every day:)|pg||

mb|p|mb|5S|nt|gulyas: now, whoever messed up the sys is at fault|pg||
nt|andyv:  immaterial now... i think S should have raised holding an A and a stiff... potentialy 2 tricks for pd.|pg||

nt|gulyas: 1NT is funny:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: well, 4@S needs some work here|pg||

nt|andyv:  6 to the Q and out?|pg||
nt|gulyas: I still doubt it could be worse than this|pg||
nt|gulyas: N, with a partial fit in @H should be able to see game somehow|pg||

nt|gulyas: 2NT just made a good result for them in the OR|pg||
nt|gulyas: surpirisingly|pg||
nt|ritong: that one is a possible swing|pg||
mb|1D|nt|andyv:  hope they don't play flannery:)|pg||
nt|ritong: after west opened 1 NT, north found a reason not to give his pard the @h ruff|pg||
nt|ritong: of course declarer falsecarded, but still..|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2D!|nt|gulyas: whats wrong with that marvellous convention?:)|pg||
nt|josj: ask Roland :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: hrmpff&%¤!!|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s partial may be the best|pg||
nt|ritong: we can see that singletons do not impress the players about opening or overcalling 1 NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|josj: ty Roland|pg||
nt|gulyas: the only tight match, to everybody's surprise is the USA-Greece match|pg||
nt|gulyas: US by 1 if I can read right|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is likely to end in 4@S and although it is possible to defeat it will likely make|pg||
nt|murat e: a potential win for americans on this board if rebids clubs now|pg||
nt|ritong: although i certainly would open west hand 1 NT, and tons of others too i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: welcome Jos, Roland:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: I have barred commentators for less|pg||
nt|andyv:  I play it ... just for this hand... impossible to stop in 2N playing flannery:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|gulyas: its not my fav, but I happen to play it now, it has its place in a str@C sys|pg||
nt|ritong: so here comes the expected swing|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gulyas: 2@S is not a bad contract either|pg||
nt|garnetts: Declarer can set up the long club on the J@C lead unless the defence finds the @D swict which is not obvious|pg||
nt|gulyas: Poland played it in 4@Sx and ended up with an overtrick on bd 27|pg||
pc|dA|nt|garnetts: That must have taken some effort Daniel  :)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but N already stepped out of character when he forook the green card on the first round of bidding, dont expect him to do it twice in a row:)|pg||

nt|gulyas: they climbed all the way to SIX @Ss on this one|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|c5|pc|d8|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|gulyas: agree there again|pg||
pc|s7|nt|garnetts: If they made 11 last time this must be a spread lol|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|nt|garnetts: By the way this is case where North probably should have played the K@D at the first chance |pg||
nt|ritong: and two boards to go|pg||

nt|murat e: 5 dollars gone away:):)|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|gulyas: its quite an achievement to take 7 tricks with the EW cards in NT:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  rather optomistic view taken by E/W in OR|pg||
nt|gulyas: very|pg||
nt|gulyas: once again, the wk overcall strikes back|pg||
nt|gulyas: or rather, comes back to haunt you:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  S has only one bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: pass?:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@S|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|marlowepi: 1 or 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  you win!|pg||
nt|gulyas: :D|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would not criticise most auctions here a variety of final contracts are possible|pg||
nt|jstokes: our 3rd weak two on a 7-card suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there we go again. 7 card suits are 3 bids|pg||
nt|ritong: no apparent legit way to make 7, but maybe minimeck will find one|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|garnetts: Good gadget here transfer to 2@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: he was let off the hook|pg||
nt|andyv:  i was taught never to leave pd in 1@C|pg||
nt|gulyas: me too (strange enough, I play precision these days:) )|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|gulyas: 5@D not terrible, if you can get away with 1 trump loser you are OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  now it can get ugly|pg||
nt|gulyas: that was lesson 1:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N by E|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|gulyas: they may end up in game as well|pg||
nt|andyv:  W has extras|pg||
nt|andyv:  and no fit|pg||
nt|gulyas: a crummy suit and a minimum?:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: if he goes on to 3NT, I would whack it with the S hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: This might make if the defence are not careful which they seem to be on that lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: trump lead is good enough to beat it|pg||
nt|gulyas: but @H lead would have gotten to several down...|pg||
nt|gulyas: he can take 9 tricks on a crossruff, thats all|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think I agree with people suggesting 4@S is perhaps the best spot--but so is a partscore |pg||
nt|garnetts: Win the K@C pass the J@D would be my line |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  or N|pg||
nt|ritong: however, they first need to declare 7|pg||
nt|ritong: i have my doubts, but who knows|pg||
nt|unclejohn: you make 7@H legit on a @S-@D trump squeeze against east|pg||
nt|ritong: i know, bart:)|pg||
nt|ritong: just setting the stage|pg||
mb|4H|nt|gulyas: mine too|pg||
nt|murat e: another 8 dollars normally|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  voila|pg||
nt|gulyas: you can hear their wheels screeching|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: specs point out the same thing: S should have doubled this, they have no fit, no power, nothing|pg||
nt|andyv:  should come up to 8 tricks (4@c, 2@h, @s and @d|pg||
nt|gulyas: other matches, this is played in 3NTx|pg||
nt|andyv:  D suit should be easy to play|pg||
nt|ritong: ouch|pg||
nt|don paulus: it's over now|pg||
nt|ritong: well, the fat lady is appearing...|pg||
nt|unclejohn: north's 1NT was apparently unlimited, so he should have bid more than this|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|andyv:  can they set up the @s fast enough?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|gulyas: the men of this world should listen up: even a young girl doubled this:) (Michielsen of NedRed)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  8@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, with no dbl from S can't be sure about @S situation|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  and pass would indicate some @c tolerance|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: the wimpy, uselss 2S bid should have achieves\d its usual destiny.....E should double 3S (responsive) and then probably 500. an opening 3S fetches double-pass-4H for a HUGE win|pg||
mc|12|nt|unclejohn: it's academic now, but the trump sqz is the best chance for 7 - run 4 trumps and clubs ending in north, then either ruff out the spades or drop east's diamonds|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  last hand for this quarter.  Thank you everyone for joining us |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|gulyas: USA Blue taking a comfortable lead, simply by not making so many mistakes|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|garnetts: I must say that the k@C then a @D to the ace and the Q@D covered would have made it|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and ty Ozgur for a great job.|pg||

nt|gulyas: spec tells me 500 was Michilsen's reward for x-ing the 3NT last hand, btw|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  it's interesting how that hand just seem to have a life of its own|pg||
nt|andyv:  looking at both hands, you might not want to even be in 1n:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: I could not agree more with that double|pg||
nt|jstokes: winning decision again by west not to bid|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|gulyas: honestly, the level of play was not too high this match so far, but maybe its still too early in Turkey as well:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: hopefully we will have better bridge in the 2nd half of the QFs|pg||
nt|andyv:  and there has to be a lot of nervous tension amongst several of the players who aren't used to this big of stage.|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|gulyas: it looks like the semifinalists are USA Blue, Italy Red, Ned Red, and Japan-Czech|pg||
