nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|nicksan: I don't want to make the same mistake again...Which one's are females?|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: none|pg||
nt|nicksan: See what you mean!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Natalia wan us to cheer tour team:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: flexible couple:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: your|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: East says that they play and bid like old guys|pg||
nt|irwinbo: hello again|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzun: Welcome back all|pg||
nt|nicksan: They may make up for it on this one though...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a razorblade sharp 4@S EW to start with:)?|pg||
nt|chick: hoi everyone :)|pg||
nt|chick: Hoi Gerbrand :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: 1N should end the auction I think|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt down here with @H lead    difficult board|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: welcome back :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|gulyas: well, this looks like a routine 3NT|pg||
nt|nicksan: Excellent, I'll be fine then!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello every one|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re Cornelia|pg||
nt|sharynr: I thought wrong already!|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|chick: commentator's curse strikes again :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S C to be saved by 5@H-2?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|nicksan: Hi, and welcome back|pg||
nt|nicksan: Are they going to get close to the slam?|pg||
nt|nicksan: Hi and welcome back |pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|neobas: Hey all, welcome back :D|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jaapfr: with combined 18 hcp very unlikely but..................|pg||
nt|jaapfr: welcome then:)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|nicksan: North is doing his bit....|pg||
nt|rnmalik: part score available here for both sides|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi Rashed|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Rashed|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: East almost doubled, but gives it a second thought|pg||
nt|sharynr: old guys dont open 2NT :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: at least if not finding @CJ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re ladies|pg||
mb|p|nt|nicksan: Ok Welcome back to the Hague everbody, another 7 board match|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Jaap and Cornelia|pg||
mb|p|nt|nicksan: E/W havo no good fit. Hope they'll discover that in time...|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: Hok is a club from Amsterdam and Buitenhof from Scheveningen, but Tammens is from Amsterdam so he is kind of in the wrong team... |pg||
nt|ady: e/w  can make 4@S   on guessing Q@C      needs spade finesse as wsell|pg||
mb|3H|nt|nicksan: Some chances in 5 @C i suppose...|pg||
nt|chick: a clear violation of Burn's First Law|pg||
nt|irwinbo: hi all|pg||
mb|4C|nt|nicksan: Wow!!|pg||
nt|neobas: Can imagine E having some trouble with bidding 2@S, since @HK are 3/9 HCP for him, but the spot is good (behind the weak 2 in @H), so I agree with 2@S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tell S 3-3 fit better 4-4 fit lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@H saved 8 imps here|pg||
mb|p|nt|nicksan: Very well done N/S indeed!|pg||
nt|nicksan: This is a nice and safe spot for E/W|pg||
nt|jaapfr: solid bidding by all|pg||
nt|neobas: It's a Roland game :)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|jaapfr: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: Hello Jaap|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Jaap Frijling|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ty Roland en hoi Gerbrand|pg||
nt|nicksan: Assuming declarer will test the dimonds and take a double finesse in spades for his ninth...|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Bas :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: unlikely to make this 5@H mb 1 or 2 down|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re all|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: NS were being optimistic, but they got away with it|pg||
nt|mamos: hi nick|pg||
nt|nicksan: This won't make, but at least it's not doubled...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he only deals in slams:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Mike Amos|pg||
nt|nicksan: With South's hand on view, I'd expect West to get this one right. |pg||
nt|jaapfr: higher and higher:)|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Irwin and Jaap|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jaapfr: re:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: -1 not too bad|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharynr: I suppose they play negative dbls over 2@H, so North felt he had to balance|pg||
nt|chick: I'm sure he hated the thought of bidding 3@D though|pg||
nt|jaapfr: :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|nicksan: I'm told North was doing HER bit, sorry.|pg||
nt|nicksan: Hi Jaap|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same result for 4@H@S-1|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|nicksan: Is this a club championship then?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S at least 1 off|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re|pg||
nt|chick: I see 4-5 losers, so will likely make this. needs to do some work before drawing trump, though|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Jaap :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|nicksan: nope|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi Cornelia and kibs:)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
nt|nicksan: A beautiful quantitative auction, What a start!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi Nick|pg||
nt|nicksan: Shows what i know...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S-2?|pg||
nt|irwinbo: 3 hearts would have been tough to make  south can't get to the dummy|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|jaapfr: down 2 a small disaster:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: one level up but what prompted N to DBL|pg||
nt|sharynr: When playing your typical 3-3 fit, the opps don't usually figure out to lead trumps early enough, but not here|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rnmalik: correct a @C ruff|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jaapfr: is it hot there Gerbrand:)? or AC?|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: we have airco :), and outside it's nice, but 20ish degrees I think, nto sunny :(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: Kees Tammens for Buitenhof Gerbrand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: yes|pg||
nt|nicksan: 460 would have looked better at pairs...but he'll take it.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: agree down 1 too|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway +500 best result for EW|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c2|nt|vugraphzun: No it's open event,|pg||
nt|nicksan: Ok, thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: They just called their teams to a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: the 3 other players of Buitenhof play there for many years already...|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jaapfr: he will find out N 1624 so likely @CQ with N so 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: if east knows of long diamonds with south and then finds north has singleton heaert  may well get club right|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|nicksan: Still, the @S King will come to the resque|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jaapfr: all lines now too -1|pg||
pc|h6|nt|nicksan: or 490 even|pg||
nt|chick: should N pass it out, or balance with 2N, or something else?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S C-5@HX-2=320 =8 imps|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jaapfr: now he knows|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jaapfr: 490 indeed|pg||
pc|c7|nt|nicksan: Heart from North now for two down...|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
nt|neobas: Can also endplay :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2N|an| |mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@C  16+   1@D  0-7|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: I know that Morath-Efraimsson were in 3NT here, but I can't see the result|pg||
nt|nicksan: a combined 25 count, but not many tricks. Can they stop low?|pg||
mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3NT -1 in the CR I am told|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @SQ lead|pg||
nt|diablo666: -1 is a pretty good result.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|nicksan: The only way to eight tricks seems to be the eight of clubs |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/m6m6o5  for running scores. Our scoreboard will be in accurate for the remainder of the match I'm afraid|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: inaccurate I meant to say|pg||
mc|13|pg||
qx|c23|st||md|1S85HJT963DK97CJ97,SAKJ7HAKQDAT8CT82,ST9632H8DQ6532C53,SQ4H7542DJ4CAKQ64|sv|b|nt|gulyas: the obvious 10 tricks, will likely be a push|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: NS are not regular, and North didnt like the overcall fo South|pg||
nt|nicksan: Thin 3 NT has some chances...|pg||
nt|nicksan: North must like diamonds...that's 20 in three hands...|pg||
nt|nicksan: He presumably thought the @C K might often hold the trick wherever the Ace is...|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C    excellent for n/s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: Cornelia:)?|pg||
nt|neobas: Haha, my own ;)|pg||
nt|chick: I wish :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this 4@H more interesting|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if they bid it|pg||
nt|sharynr: I think if balancing in an auction where neg dbls are played, he can be safe to be sure his pard won't be spades...|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: EW continue with their fast play, |pg||
nt|jaapfr: despite the 2nt:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a 20-20 board|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i was taught long ago that in most cases, the four level belongs to the opponents|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: where this board ends?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: is nowadys the 5 level|pg||
nt|chick: hmm, I thought that was the 5 level :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|gulyas: I didn't either:)|pg||
nt|mamos: bravely done for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: might be a pass out|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y or mb 1nt EW?|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: a lot of voids so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: guess they will bid it if South overcalls in @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: it really had no point|pg||
nt|nicksan: Wow, what a monster hand...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@DD reaceble and playable?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and unbeatable|pg||
nt|don paulus: NS may take out in 5 @d|pg||
nt|sharynr: but not this time :)|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|mamos: seems more likely East opened|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if by W|pg||
nt|nicksan: 3 NT, not 4 @S here for the money...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can drown easily the @H suit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7% of all boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|nicksan: Yes, Director!|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: NS lead attitude|pg||
nt|mamos: hello again|pg||
nt|nicksan: Hi Mike!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@C cue here?|pg||
nt|nicksan: N/S may go to 6 @S !   Bad lay out...|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, everyone|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re Ed|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: S-->E: N has 5-5|pg||
nt|nicksan: Hi Ed.You arrive just in time...|pg||
nt|nicksan: are a girl's best friend...|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|gulyas: the hand was weak, balanced, the suit very poor, and pd a passed hand|pg||
nt|sharynr: so should dbl in case pard had the penalty dbl then|pg||
nt|jaapfr: often used for Majors weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: needs @C 3-2 and some 4-1 are ok for slam|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and no very odd distributions EW|pg||
nt|ady: what is 2NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: not alerted, so my guess is 18-19|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D best for NS|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pls PASS|pg||
nt|chick: cold 7N|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|gulyas: what did he want to achieve?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3rd hand so now 1NT with extras is best|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: I believe 3NT was alerted|pg||
nt|nicksan: One of them had the right idea...|pg||
nt|chick: nice job by N continuing the preempt|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lovely interference NS|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 8-11 hcp 2@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: all he could get into is trouble|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: sorry :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: Hello Mike|pg||
nt|jaapfr: -100 fine score|pg||
nt|sharynr: what would he bid if not invintational?|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: pass or directly 2M|pg||
nt|sharynr: ty :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: name of the convention i did forget|pg||
nt|irwinbo: yes the five level too, but competing to the four level for a part score is usually losing bridge|pg||
mb|3N|nt|nicksan: np|pg||
nt|jaapfr: previos session he came in with a -1100|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i suppose a sayc 2/1 acol one|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now a coffee break 3nt|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Pass by W slightly too cautious|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: EW lead 2/4|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even -50 looming|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: and udca |pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: he got away with murder, he could sigh that nothing bad happened|pg||
nt|nicksan: She'll be trying clubs soon, I hope|pg||
nt|Walddk3: It surprises me that Jamilla doesn't introduce her clubs|pg||
nt|nicksan: Should be long clubs. Should also have been the final contract in my view..|pg||
mb|4N|nt|gulyas: EW again in a routine-like game, but this time there are some bad breaks|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Nick Sandqvist|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello Nick|pg||
nt|nicksan: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: Hello Nick|pg||
nt|jaapfr: optimist|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: NS lead 135|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @H5 best for fense|pg||
nt|jaapfr: de|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: South was thinkign about @D5|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok any red 5 will do|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: now about a small @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: N can return a @H to get another @D ruff, but then he should not try to cash the @CA|pg||
nt|othered1: Is this a forcing auction?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: too strong to open 1NT|pg||
nt|neobas: 3@C CBS and 3@D minimum without 3@H/4@S?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: need  @S|pg||
nt|irwinbo: why would he invite opposite 8-11|pg||
nt|sharynr: kib said Tilburgese|pg||
nt|irwinbo: hard to believe that he didn't balance|pg||
nt|irwinbo: you need good distribution to do so|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4NT??|pg||
nt|jaapfr: looks quantative|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think not 4nt but 6nt bid|pg||
nt|chick: agree|pg||
nt|irwinbo: doesn't it seem that east should just bid 6 with his good 5 card suit?|pg||
nt|chick: and the fault belongs solely to E if they miss this|pg||
mb|6N|nt|jaapfr: for -2 i meant|pg||
nt|sharynr: sorry Tiburgse|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzun: She did at 5level|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: still 1nt was high enough but i think we all understand the 2nt bid by E|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb he can bid 6@D with expected void of his pd\|pg||
nt|Walddk3: well, she did eventually, sort of|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: Merijn is happily surprised|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb it was 9-12:) or 9 -14:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: yy found 6@C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: at least if no pass|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chick: good thing W was brave, but they still missed the grand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: almost unbiddable i think|pg||
nt|chick: E should also consider that W opened 2N without a club stopper and won't be excited about accepting any invitations|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jaapfr: 5@D -1|pg||
nt|sharynr: maybe south should balance with 4NT not DBL|pg||
pc|s8|nt|nicksan: Should West start with a clubhonour? He want's to finesse twice...|pg||
nt|mamos: well this 2NT might make|pg||
nt|nicksan: A brave attempt by West to let it through, but it's not enough...|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in @S|pg||
nt|nicksan: Ok, we have some action. Will need to be very careful here...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: 4NT good bid |pg||
nt|jaapfr: yyyyy|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: maybe I should have stayed for the next match and let Gerbrand do BBO? :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: either action is pushy though, I think|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jaapfr: at least ic no more than 7 tricks EW|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the @C return after @CA misses logic imo?|pg||
nt|chick: hehehe|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gulyas: now declarer can just ruff his 2 @H losers and claim|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 300 most normal or 100|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|jaapfr: which bid established @C as trumps?|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: none|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: might make 6@H without trumps lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but he is houdini brave:)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|nicksan: It'll be closer than I first thought...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: that is it -1|pg||
nt|chick: E may see a threat of setting up an extra spade trick for declarer|pg||
pc|c8|nt|nicksan: Yes, North better off not to ruff the third diamond "in thin air"|pg||
nt|othered1: this is redoubled, so 600 or 200|pg||
nt|sharynr: opposite passed partner, no way you want to be in game anyway|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
mc|13|nt|jaapfr: Martin tells me that S is 14 years old and plays with his Dad:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: they're doing great!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the man was saved by the woman|pg||

nt|vugraphzun: they are discussing the board now, and thinking what would happen when North didn't ruff the @DJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: it's a 7 board RR match|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: they were wondering how many tricks West made, no1 really kept tricks|pg||

nt|jaapfr: sorry Gerbranddddddddddddddddddd:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: West thinking how to beat it|pg||
nt|chick: 20/20|pg||
nt|jaapfr: stay out 6@C here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: at least for NS:)|pg||
nt|chick: hehehe|pg||
nt|jaapfr: -2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: despite the 31 hcp better not more than a modest 3nt|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hope dad and son can find 3nt here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: rescued|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: EW have a choice of major suit fits and little reason to get too h igh|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: S noticed it now :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: and says @H lead :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: good thought|pg||
nt|chick: 3N best I think|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3 NT for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|nicksan: tx|pg||
nt|jaapfr: here|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: West is known to love slams so..|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mamos: nothing much making here i think|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2@S by E|pg||
nt|neobas: Roland board|pg||
nt|jaapfr: USA can open with even a 21 and 22 hcp  1X hardly never in Europe so 3NT for us very acceptable|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: right, if N discards, it is much harder for him to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: today is 7x 7 RR, to qualify for groups tomorrow|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but now for S difficult to stay away of slam|pg||
nt|sharynr: 4@S should be the final spot here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jaapfr: this 4@S is C|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: anyone knows why E bids 2nt?|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: 2nd hand red vs white preempt?|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: East explains that 3@D is support, and says that 2N would be natural, and hopes he has 4@S, but far from sure|pg||
nt|nicksan: Someone better bid clubs...i don't think they'll beat 4 @s|pg||
nt|sharynr: although maybe not now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2@C i suppose\|pg||
nt|rnmalik: looks like. Should not have any problems. Cards lay out 4@S friendly|pg||
nt|sharynr: Had south not opened the bidding, they would have a chance of missing game|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not all of us do agree with 1nt|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jaapfr: marco 3@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzun: yes Marco 3@S...|pg||
mb|3C|nt|gulyas: a very nice 1NT hand, he will likely make it, too|pg||
nt|jaapfr: brave to oblige the 4 level|pg||
nt|jaapfr: N played with 12 cards:)??|pg||
nt|othered1: 1NT welcomed NS into the auction.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzun: before he started bidding|pg||
nt|nicksan: Need a diamond ruff to beat this... |pg||
nt|jaapfr: most do have semi frc openings  (NS as well?)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: in Europe, is this double takeout or penalty?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can he PASS now??|pg||
nt|sharynr: no spots and insufficient values should discourage him though|pg||
mb|3S|nt|nicksan: Nice, controlled auction avoiding the dreaded 5 level. East showing @C shortage and West getting out. |pg||
nt|vugraphzun: NS lead 135|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if above 60 years of age an easy 3nt but if much younger..........................|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzun: 2@C was natural, as you can see|pg||
nt|nicksan: North should really have doubled this.  His partner ovecalled!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: so now ic why E did bid 2NT:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: it's Marco ter Laare, did you expect something else?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: as did E:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: I never saw Marco afraid|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or 4NT tx kibs|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt ew fine here|pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugraphzun: She ;-)|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: East tells about the void in @C|pg||
nt|neobas: t/o|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 3nt with all helpful leads:)|pg||
nt|ady: puppet |pg||
nt|jaapfr: best and to be expected is @CT (best for defense)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in between but more  take out imo|pg||
nt|chick: on the first round he had a chance to double for the other 2 suits|pg||
nt|chick: she*|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ??|pg||
nt|sharynr: what was 2@D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: all 4 players know each other good, they play for De Lombard in Rotterdam|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: they play it as any minimum|pg||
nt|jaapfr: think N knows S can be very weakkkkkkkkk-lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: East is the only really young person at this table, he is 18 I believe|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4nt a bit optimistic:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this goes wrong for ew|pg||
mb|5C|nt|gulyas: oops, sry:)|pg||
nt|sharynr: ty Natalia :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even DD it will go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: it's not clear to me that S should stay out of slam|pg||
nt|jaapfr: direct after 3nt a 4nt bid looks very quantative|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@C may be|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I forgot, the couple in love:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzun: North knowst that South loves to overcall, as we saw earlier today (1st match)|pg||
nt|neobas: Nève tricking his partner in a possibly bad lead here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @S& better for declarer:)|pg||
nt|ady: spade  lead will make life easier|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: East west speak French to each other but dutch to the opponents :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzun: East still playing with a @C lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: must return @C now else a chance|pg||
nt|jaapfr: -1|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jaapfr: entame de @H etait mieux pd contre 6@H:)?|pg||
nt|ady: club lead best for defence    |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody!|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: Hi Ed|pg||
nt|jaapfr: small disaster of -500 possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: and North is telling the dummy which card to play in English :)|pg||
nt|chick: sure, it doesn't make, but if you don't bid these and it does make, you've lost big imps|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can not argue with that:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: depends on the lead now-@D made|pg||
nt|don paulus: always lose a @c though|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mamos: yes   show this pair on same wavelength|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1NT by E likely -1 and 2@S C likely so a push board despite the brave X|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @S lead looks rite|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|nicksan: Just like that. Good lead!|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: so they mix up languages quite a lot...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yr analysis best 6@C made now:)|pg||
nt|don paulus: duck|pg||
nt|jaapfr: Rashed|pg||
nt|jaapfr: where is Cornelia:)?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i even prefer to open 1nt as E (much more than @C @C @S bid|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jaapfr: hoi Ed:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 0930 with you?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even then can make|pg||
nt|chick: duck is good, but don't think it matters|pg||
nt|sharynr: I can hardly blame South for showing a minimum|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gulyas: the best would have been to play a low @S to hold this to 8 tricks, but that is the most likely outcome anyway|pg||
nt|ady: east might be squeezed later in the minors|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|don paulus: think he must lose a @d then|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not really imo|pg||
nt|jaapfr: strip and trow in then still makes|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jaapfr: mb 1 imp if OT|pg||
nt|don paulus: if Q @d played - put K and J is high|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now he makes:)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|jaapfr: searching your watch:)?|pg||
nt|sharynr: How high do most NMF players play the new minor?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jaapfr: +100 3@D-1 or 3M C so 1 imp no big deal|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|nicksan: But one trick from South is not too much to hope for, is it?|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|irwinbo: the three diamond bid was a bit much unless you play strong club|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can use now @CQ as vital entry|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jaapfr: -800 looming|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but mb too DD|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jaapfr: anyway against -110 or +100 even 3@S-1 any score wrong for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: The website with the results is http://www.nbbportal.nl/3023/ and then click on "Competitie"|pg||
nt|nicksan: E/W missing here. Now a club to East...|pg||
nt|ady: could make 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d7|nt|chick: good example why not to lead low from a J :)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|irwinbo: it seems to me that west should bid 3nt over 3 spades.  she has already raised clubs and can hope for a heart card in partners hand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jaapfr: frc 1 round i think|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzun: East claiming 3 trump losers :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzun: as dummy...|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: no1 agrees or reacts only|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||

pc|dT|nt|jaapfr: au |pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|nicksan: And north did well not to get involved in the bidding with his 16 count...|pg||
nt|othered1: except that west had two chances to lead @H and didn't seem to give it much thought|pg||
nt|jaapfr: result of the discussion about missed 6@D I suppose\|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i have sympathy for W problems|pg||
nt|jaapfr: for E as well:)|pg||
mc|10|nt|irwinbo: some or many would have bid 2nt not 3 clubs|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 4@H EW |pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S can be good save|pg||
nt|ady: around 11 tricks in       hearts|pg||

nt|jaapfr: Gerbrand|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: hmm, like I can't help it that they play so slow|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if W fully awake he could foresee this in tr 1 and return @C to get rid of that vital entry and it would be -1|pg||
nt|irwinbo: or a heart lead|pg||
nt|chick: yes, NS didn't earn the IMPs, EW gave to them|pg||

nt|ady: n/s  not in the bidding|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I was watching the previous match and Ritmeijer is aggressive|pg||

mb|3S|nt|nicksan: This will end in 3 NT, surely?|pg||

nt|jaapfr: would you pass as W?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: well this has play  |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|gulyas: :)|pg||

nt|jaapfr: and fine player i think:)|pg||
nt|don paulus: if you play so well, you can afford :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: wrong again, perhaps not playing it|pg||
nt|irwinbo: possiblly two|pg||
pc|c8|nt|gulyas: 5@Ds, 2@Hs, 1-1@Cand@S is the minimum, 9 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: they went to 6@S on bd 2 in the OR|pg||
nt|nicksan: 12 IMP's to spangenberg for the 4 @S that could have been beaten here a couple of board ago|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Jamilla doubled for the lead against 6@S|pg||
nt|gulyas: that was not a good contract|pg||
nt|othered1: If you're gonna discuss disasters while still in play, it's tougher to clear your head for the next hand.  "Keller" approach to at the table partnership behavior has a lot to say ...|pg||
nt|othered1: for itself.|pg||
nt|sharynr: this would be a slam effort if they did|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @C8 or @C*?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk3: @D9 ruffed, heart to the queen and another diamond ruff|pg||
nt|jaapfr: so many good BBO players even if boiling inside say nothing during any match|pg||
nt|jaapfr: we stoped with that over 30 years ago:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: p|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jaapfr: bidding and lead and 10 tricks all too normal this board:)|pg||
nt|nicksan: Didn't even mention the suit!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: -3|pg||
nt|sharynr: i am confused....|pg||
nt|jaapfr: they too in 2 mintes|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: aah :) West didnt properly explain,|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Then North tried to cash @CA|pg||
nt|nicksan: A lot of tricks available due to the heart layout|pg||
nt|chick: 3N? :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: spot on:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: funny 3NT DD unbeatable here|pg||
nt|sharynr: how strong does he expect|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: and West overbid he says|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gulyas: and it did go down, but it should not have been more than a few imps, since 4@S could have been beaten|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer doesnt know that yet though|pg||
nt|nicksan: True, and his comunications aren't great.|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: her :)|pg||
nt|nicksan: I've done it again!|pg||
nt|nicksan: Her, sorry.|pg||
nt|nicksan: Exactly, how am I supposed to know that?|pg||
nt|mamos: ew dont appear able to get ruff|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but how to make it???|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even DD a puzzle to get 9 tricks|pg||
nt|chick: and endplay somewhere|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @S lead was worst for delarer|pg||
nt|chick: W is very vulnerable to endplays, but if defense persists in spades, they will get 2 spades and 3 AAK tricks|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
pc|cT|nt|chick: underleading the A against a suit contract is generally considered the worst lead in bridge|pg||
nt|jaapfr: oh sorry 5@H losers|pg||
nt|sharynr: why did you stop...dont want to distinguish? or is 4@H better from your side?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @CAKJ S trowing @CT and @SA -3 claim|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jaapfr: confusing south african texas etc|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|ady: not guaranteed to make this|pg||
nt|jaapfr: very few bidding systems will allow NS come into the bidding here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mamos: comms need some little symbols|pg||
nt|sharynr: nice def Jaap|pg||
nt|chick: I would never pass the W hand when opps open weak 2.  Even if S is strong, I'm behind him |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|othered1: 8 perhaps preferring @S?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: over and made|pg||
pc|d6|nt|nicksan: Should make. E/W going for 500 in 5 @C, so not much in it.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: NS robbed of their 4@H here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: agree|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jaapfr: you see things i do not imo will make this easily|pg||

nt|jaapfr: they do same|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|nicksan: East overcome by nerves, not counting his (her) tricks properly...|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: East shaking his head now|pg||
nt|ady: can set up a club to get a diamond away|pg||
nt|don paulus: if lead small @h - otherwise blocked|pg||
nt|sharynr: of course|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sharynr: well with cards lying as they are, it would appear that south DOES have a slam try :)|pg||

nt|sharynr: hw should play king?|pg||
pc|s9|pg||

nt|jaapfr: for 10 th needed @SK disc @H and @HH and @C9 for trown in|pg||
pc|d5|nt|othered1: cashing major winners will provide west with endplay - @C for @D lead.|pg||
nt|sharynr: no more spades...|pg||

nt|jaapfr: we see another playable 6@C lol|pg||
nt|chick: easy slam if S can find the @CQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: it's not fun to watch for me :(|pg||
nt|sharynr: he kept @H because east showed hearts :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: an obvious misunderstanding there|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb W thought E strength of 18+ or so|pg||
mb|1D|nt|nicksan: Can happen to anyone. Forget anout it and take the IMP's back !|pg||
nt|nicksan: On our first board, N/S bid a great 6 @C. That has brought them 11 IMP's. |pg||
nt|nicksan: Still, N/S sorted out their lenghts accurately. Danger of ending up in 5 @D...  |pg||
nt|jaapfr: as normal seeing 52 cards the game is so easy|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT for NS |pg||
nt|vugraphzun: they had no agreements about the strenght of the strong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: yes I reckon 4@S= is good result there|pg||
nt|sharynr: oh, dont worry, they wont bid slam, Natalia:)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|othered1: vulnerability may let EW have a straight shot at this excellent grand slam.|pg||
nt|ady: easy game in hearts for n/s|pg||
nt|chick: 5@C for NS if they can find it|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: if he makes 6@C here i will eat all cards:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: EW are not regular|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1nt or 2@D C by EW 3@C-1|pg||
mb|1N|nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7@C 7@H but not too easy to bid?|pg||
nt|sharynr: wow, brave DBL|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ty|pg||
nt|jaapfr: p-p-2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|nicksan: Expect them to rest in 3 NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ty Bas:)|pg||
nt|chick: please speak into the hidden microphone, Jaap :)|pg||
nt|chick: I want proof of your offer :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this is fun for you|pg||
nt|rnmalik: that solves all the bidding:)|pg||
nt|chick: and not going to work out well |pg||
mb|p|nt|nicksan: East in OR balancing with 2 @H !!  Don't try this at home!|pg||
nt|nicksan: I can answer any question about how to bid North's hand. Have it at rubber all the time...|pg||
nt|chick: actually 3N makes too|pg||
nt|chick: both because the @DA onside|pg||
nt|don paulus: hi good afternoon to you all - i am paul from belgium|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: S asked about the meaning of the dbl, W explained: probably his suit|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Paul :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: after 2@H NS will be there|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway a working 3nt but pd to pass first|pg||
mb|p|nt|nicksan: I'd certainly be pleased to have it on my scorecard.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mamos: passing 1@S looks odd|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT normal|pg||
nt|nicksan: Stopping low now, but this hasn't made yet...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: att least 790|pg||
nt|sharynr: In a match that you rate to be winning..I would not have taken East's action at all|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S DBL is to play|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in 5@C-1 was 1nt by E a 5 imp win:(|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gulyas: bd2, 2imps for Hok for extra overtricks in 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: South finally can get some coffee, he's happy about it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: soon claim 9 tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gulyas: for a change, an easy-looking 3NT...|pg||
nt|nicksan: A friendly lay out, should end up with eleven...|pg||
nt|bobholl: dankzij het zitsel :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: neobas|pg||
nt|ady: this should be quick|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi Paul|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mamos: ugh  |pg||
nt|nicksan: Only one more off than 2 NT...|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: 2@c = not alerted, but NS looked at EW's convention card|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H must be an error bid|pg||
nt|othered1: Guess no shot at all.  Perhaps east's bids and the playing strength of the hand aren't consistent|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: He is still a Junior, might explain it|pg||
nt|nicksan: No suit + no hand  + no reson = - 800|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mamos: but surely East knows 3NT hs no hope|pg||
pc|d7|nt|nicksan: Reason|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: I have learnt that + plus + gives + and not - Nick|pg||
nt|nicksan: Badly fitting hands. No play in this.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 11|pg||
nt|neobas: Yup|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if n @S lead and @CK AND A then 4 times @D and i have to swallow:( |pg||
nt|jaapfr: if not|pg||
nt|don paulus: even 7 if no @s start ? and @c finesse in right direction|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can he get this for -2?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: South started laughing when Norht bdi 6@C|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sharynr: So perhaps the DBL was meant to have North misplay the trump suit??|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: might make only 10|pg||
nt|ady: a heart to the ace   play safe and play spades|pg||
nt|chick: he won't finesse though :(|pg||
nt|don paulus: not likely|pg||
nt|jaapfr: declarer thinking now mb i make or -1 not a big disaster|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: not after the pass of West I think|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jaapfr: Bas were you 2 years ago also 17 years old:)?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: praying @SA|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: after this lead he might|pg||
nt|rnmalik: If @S led he will have to|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|jaapfr: W upset by visit director?|pg||
nt|nicksan: A,A,A...that's how my mother would have defended...|pg||
nt|don paulus: 8 tricks from top - 9th K @d|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s5|nt|gulyas: 4-2-2-3 tricks is possible|pg||
nt|nicksan: If East's rebid was 22-25 i think West was worth a quant 4 NT at the most...|pg||
nt|neobas: Haha, turning 18 in a month :P|pg||
nt|chick: there really is no way around playing the @D toward K, close your eyes and hope :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: :)|pg||
nt|chick: why have to?  clubs could easily break 2-2 |pg||
nt|jaapfr: i doubt he will finesse|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he wants me to swallow 52 cards:(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the X does cost 4 or 5 imps|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: leads 135 and udca (also at discarding) for EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: W asks for signals|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: about*|pg||
nt|nicksan: You're trying to trip me up , aren't you?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: nice 10 tr lol|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|nicksan: So he know wich finesse to take when he gets to dummy?|pg||
nt|neobas: A little over|pg||
pc|h6|nt|gulyas: W encourages in @D, that should make it even easier|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c8|nt|irwinbo: looks like down two for sure|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: 11 now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we will see. Cashing a quick trick signifies some sort of resistance|pg||
nt|don paulus: K then 10 ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if like that he mite find even a no 12 lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: sorry, I'm lost now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: just claim:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: tell it to Sigrid :)|pg||

pc|c7|pc|h7|nt|gulyas: declarer learing from the opps mistake, and making sure of the 9 tricks in time:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: defense immacullate|pg||

nt|jaapfr: no difference|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|nicksan: Hi Henri, just in time for....the end!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry:)|pg||
nt|chick: that's a very good point.   when an opp leads an A vs IMP slam, often means s/he has a trump trick|pg||

nt|Walddk2: What a rhyme, I should have been a poet|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I thought you were:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: We would obviously all lead a low club against 6@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|an| |mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But that would not have helped in the other room because East was declarer|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|gulyas: I still don't see how 6@H made - N led a @S honor?|pg||

nt|gulyas: oh, THIS hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|gulyas: I misunderstood|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, this looks like a decent slam, one on a finesse is almost considered decent these days:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: If anyone can find a low club, it's Magnusson. He is very imaginative|pg||
nt|gulyas: E with those aces and kings will bid slam now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You should not rule it out|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: The auction suggests that West has no club control, doesn't it?|pg||

nt|othered1: with it too.|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: East said that 3@H showed 3@H,|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: but West said he didnt know|pg||
nt|ritong: the thrilly part of it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this board much more interesting|pg||

mb|1H|nt|jaapfr: bidding and play|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|othered1: ty.  Then I'd split charges for missing small slam.  west for underevaluating and east for misdescribing.  Just my two cents, however.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: looks easy 4@S here and despite 4-0 will bring it home|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: looks quite regular result|pg||
nt|jaapfr: here 3nt has no real chance to be made|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gulyas: bd4 played in the other room in the meantime, in an inferior contract, 5@D, but still making|pg||
nt|gulyas: so 12 back to Hok, in the lead now|pg||
nt|nicksan: This overcall may get West to play the clubs right if she get's to 3 NT, Chance for a swing...|pg||
mb|p|nt|nicksan: Looks like a MULTI, and a heavy one to boot!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: spot on Ed:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: we all pass as N?|pg||
nt|nicksan: N/S in OR managing to find one of their shortest fits...|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: what else?|pg||
nt|ady: anything higher than 4@H uncomfortable|pg||
mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|gulyas: a bit optimistic 3NT in the other room, down 2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: my bet here NS end in 6@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: Welcome back from the Hague|pg||
pc|c3|nt|nicksan: 3 NT look a normal spot to me...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with their -1100 must do something if chance|pg||
nt|ritong: looks obvious|pg||
nt|nicksan: 14 IMP's for Buitenhof on the hand we watched N/S go down in 5 @S XX. E/W tried 5 @HX for -800!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ritong: north knows a great contract is on, but with east|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|nicksan: I would raise this to game...with two keycards...|pg||
nt|chick: anyone know what 3@D is?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: on the beauty interference board 3@D and 4@D they deserved the 12 imps for that (b2)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: may good raise to 3@H|pg||
nt|jaapfr: duck @CJ!|pg||

nt|othered1: Must have a specific agreement about redouble -- supportless might be dangerous.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: not again pl|pg||
nt|chick: 4432 with 7 points ... maybe a weak raise to 3@H :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: another @SA required here|pg||

nt|jaapfr: we agree|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jaapfr: result ok but nv 4@S i  differ of opinion    far too strong|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|d5|nt|nicksan: The big swing coming from the hand where N/S here got to 4 @S instead of 3 NT. |pg||

nt|gulyas: with 6-5, 3@H is not too aggressive, even all vul|pg||

nt|vugraphzun: last board for today|pg||
nt|irwinbo: looks like it should go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: thats is likely:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: NS discussing Norths lead and SOuth didnt lead it|pg||
nt|othered1: pushy 3N here, but it's one that "everyuone" bids|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this board made as a lesson for wild 2nt openings as N|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I made that bid keeping the bidding style of the previous boards:)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|nicksan: Again 3 NT has a somewhat better chance than 4 @S...but on best defence goes a few off|pg||

nt|mamos: I like 1@s here   can show ten of our cards hopefully ig 1@H may be harder|pg||
nt|jaapfr: oefff|pg||
pc|cK|nt|nicksan: Yes, you can...with a bit of good guessing..|pg||
nt|nicksan: Should try 3 NT in my opinion...|pg||
nt|chick: undoubled not so bad|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: alert was about 2+ @cs|pg||
nt|sharynr: ty|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3 NT has a play here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb S will not sleep of the adreline shot (tonite:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this is really last board of today|pg||
nt|irwinbo: now its easy|pg||
nt|irwinbo: thanks all|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzun: North thinking about 6|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt-1 seems unavoidable here for all pairs|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: aah, they changed the agreement sorry|pg||
nt|nicksan: Hard to find even a possibility of a ninth...|pg||
nt|ritong: i m surprised they still play puppet|pg||
nt|jaapfr: why?|pg||
nt|sharynr: seems to have made 9 tricks in OR|pg||
pc|cT|nt|othered1: on @S lead, pin the 8|pg||
nt|nicksan: But i don't think West safety played the trumps...|pg||
nt|chick: in fact easy on a @H lead|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|nicksan: I see that North likes solid opening bids...|pg||
nt|mamos: looks like a 19 count to me|pg||
nt|ritong: well, the interest is to find 5/3 major fits, basically|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even then 3nt can be made|pg||
nt|ady: should certainly make now|pg||
nt|don paulus: Q @c ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a small @C would be brilliant|pg||
nt|jaapfr: E too strong for 3@H imo|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mamos: hmmm tense |pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx Cornelia Irwin kibs for asking and speccing and Natalia and Gerbrand you were greta:)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk3: cute switch|pg||
nt|jaapfr: DD=Double Dummy is seeing 52 cards|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gulyas: now that is a lot of down:)|pg||
nt|nicksan: He, he...tricky!|pg||
nt|neobas: Yup, can't treat the @Ds wrong|pg||
nt|jaapfr: fine feeling as commentator|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i don't like 2nt especially at imps  3clubs would be passed and would make|pg||
nt|sharynr: @D block but @S 3-3 for entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: last board of this match|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|gulyas: @C back, @H to A, @C ruff, and a @D thru...|pg||
nt|chick: agree, 1@H overcall better|pg||
nt|jaapfr: much:)|pg||
nt|don paulus: if they do weak jump overcalls - this is dbl jump - so strong ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: they play it as weak according to their CC|pg||
nt|chick: probably intended as preemptive|pg||
nt|jaapfr: then 1@H or 4@H|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@C and 6@S do make here easily|pg||
pc|h7|nt|nicksan: West avoiding the diastrous diamond lead...flat board?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: great|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: can see an obvious line on a club lead?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
pc|hA|nt|nicksan: Even that's counting low, but it got the job done and that's what matters...|pg||
nt|ady: cant|pg||
nt|chick: Great job Natalia @H@H@H|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|nicksan: @H Ace is bad play. If North has all three....|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes @D @D and x@H |pg||
pc|hT|nt|nicksan: All together now...ACE|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: they guessed the @S's in the other room but didnt guess the @H's|pg||
nt|ritong: when nowadays everybody is happy to be in 3 NT with two balanced hands|pg||
nt|nicksan: That's one. Well spotted Ed!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: try 7@S XX C for nice score|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gulyas: oops|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: when the game is not bid by the first bid then difficult:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @DA @CA x@H trump @CK and claim 12|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gulyas: no @S for S to ruff with:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: did south have ruffs/|pg||
nt|gulyas: sry|pg||
nt|jaapfr: couple of operators:)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|othered1: That cover should let this make|pg||
pc|c4|nt|nicksan: Better!|pg||
nt|ady: club threw  and  then spade   and another club?|pg||
nt|chick: as a preempt, it did work, NS too high ..... although not sure if they can match the 400 from the other room anyway|pg||

nt|sharynr: ty all|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|nicksan: @C ruff ?|pg||
nt|othered1: But this is the normal play, that likely won't work here|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzun: East thought @HJ was played|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyone knows who S is?|pg||
nt|chick: on the other hand,  looking more and more like 500 here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 8|pg||
