nt|vugraphzuj: last board now. back in a few minutes|pg||

nt|werge: 6 @C... = 1.370|pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes David - interesting to see what will happen|pg||
nt|ady: nice mis fit n/s|pg||
nt|werge: or 600 in 5 @C at least|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|nt|ralfwil: Yes!|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|raghavan: has to bid 1NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: It´s a warm weather here.....|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: would have opened 5C|pg||
nt|ady: yes    5@C   appears to make|pg||
nt|werge: 5 @C is the bid after 1 @S|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  ty Liv, Ralf, Linda, Svein and specs|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lml: good match for Rubb og stubb|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 1@d on E, but can accept 1nt|pg||
nt|sao: 9 tricks here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Hans werge - I like ur bid of 5C after 1S|pg||
nt|werge: Must be a hand like this one|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C   hapens to make   but if KQJ10XXX heats and A@D was opposite would not be good|pg||
mb|6H|nt|cuttysark: Not keen on this overcall: since 1@D consumes no spade it should show either a good suit or a good hand...|pg||
nt|layzi: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: He must think he has a good hand :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now it is going from bad to worse - South will assume extra in N hand and go overboard|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and why not playing low on the lead?|pg||
nt|lml: I like 1@D too.  The best thing about 1NT is it is preemptive|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Is there any award for "The worst bid hand of the year" - the I see a candidate...?|pg||
nt|raghavan: North need not have bid 4S > |pg||
nt|ady: they are not on a wave length here to put it mildly|pg||
nt|raghavan: very much wrong contract |pg||
pc|s7|nt|werge: - and East has an opening bis against 6 NT|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but can make 11 on this lead|pg||
nt|werge: So a +-score|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c9|nt|lml: either way it is good for east-west to get to notrump fast|pg||
pc|h5|nt|raghavan: If w continues Clubs goes 1 down |pg||
nt|cuttysark: He could also try a heart or a spade|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sorry - forget the spade!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Unless you can cash 3 hearts without bloking the suit...|pg||
nt|raghavan: E discarded a spade - so clubs or H|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can South have more than 2 hearts on this bidding?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: some relief    but I am sure n/s expect a substantial loss on this hand    will be plesantly surprised|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h6|pc|s8|pg||

nt|lestergold: or 3s if opps dont find club ruff|pg||

mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: This will not play well|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually 3s is very unlikely needs defensive assistance|pg||

pc|sA|nt|raghavan: not good for declarer|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|raghavan: W could have left 2C since he has 4 clubs|pg||

nt|ralfwil: I don´t understand. N must know that 2 aces are missing, so why 5@d?|pg||
nt|lml: the pause suggest that South is confused|pg||
nt|lml: because this auction doesn't make sense|pg||

pc|h6|nt|raghavan: yes|pg||

pc|cK|nt|ralfwil: and also - if N is interested in slam he should have passed on 5@hX|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|cuttysark: On this occasion probably prefers that North-South do compete|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lml: I give North 100% of the blame.  You can't put that kind of pressure on South|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Linda!|pg||
nt|lml: if they don't cash the two acues thought and they might not  North-South might make it|pg||
nt|lml: aces though|pg||

pc|h3|nt|sao: only need to cash @h..|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|lestergold: unlucky really west had a good hand with two bullets amittedly  on the flat side|pg||
mc|8|nt|kiwibridge: a misclick I would suggest, you can only make a forcing pass if opps have bid|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: we could both be rich if we had the motivation to get out and earn it, instead of sitting here watching a card game  :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: infrangible even on a double dummy diamond lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cuttysark: North has been eating red meat!|pg||
nt|raghavan: D|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|lml: the puppet Stayman auction is going to get them to the right contract I think|pg||
nt|raghavan: K and spade return - defense may have 5 tricks |pg||
nt|raghavan: DK|pg||
nt|lestergold: i actually made quite a lot of money compared to average the trouble is i spent even more thaty i made|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but S to return there are none|pg||
nt|vugraphzuj: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=09Monlag|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: ten tricks eitehr way|pg||
nt|raghavan: I was commenting on a D lead from South|pg||
nt|lestergold: a diamond lead by south declarer makes 10 tricks just the same|pg||
nt|chick: first S needs to find out that the @S8 wasn't an encouraging signal :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: on a 1NT-3NT auction there is something to be said for leading the @DK|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless he takes asilly greedy finesse |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: those are the results for round 9, santyclz is trying to get us a later result|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u it was a losing option possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphzuj: standings after round 10, updates will come soon|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very acdemical discussion at any rate|pg||
nt|santyclz: I finally figured out that the 09 is the date, not the round number|pg||
nt|raghavan: I meant original first lead of D - If declarer goes with A ok makes - but if ducks to DK?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: south might just as well have led any suit otyher than spades hopin to hit partner's possible entry|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|hT|pc|h3|nt|cuttysark: A trump lead is best, but very difficult for West|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: no but if pard had an entry he would be able to lead a spade thru toi pick up that all important setting trick thats what im saying|pg||

nt|layzi: right:) |pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|lestergold: we can see infrangible 5d for e/w but 5s n/s makes a profit two off for 300|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|cuttysark: In the other room North passed South's 2@H - slightly surprising|pg||
nt|chick: first E or W has to bid diamonds|pg||
mb|3D|nt|raghavan: here too|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: They did it here too - well, I am still surprised|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: I thought S being unpassed, it is forcing for 1Rd atleast|pg||
nt|cuttysark: A new suit at the 2-level by an unpassed hand is forcing in my book also - seems my book is out of step inNorway :)It is focing|pg||
nt|lml: this hand isn't trivial with the splits|pg||
nt|raghavan: how nicely they get to Spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: but wow not as biog a profit as 3s making doubloe swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|layzi: wow..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes a great steal|pg||
nt|lestergold: wheel off|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: e/w wheel off|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: by passing on first rounf east's 3d became non forcing|pg||
pc|h2|nt|raghavan: Liz what is the name of your book? How can I get hold of it - I am from Chennai of India |pg||
nt|chick: maybe W insecure because of his minimal opening|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am afraid my book is not yet written...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|raghavan: !!!!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: west minimum so passed happy that pard had bid his second suit|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cuttysark: not much demand, I suspect :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: interesting how declarer will play the @s after the lead|pg||
nt|lml: with the possible diamond ruff he can easily go wrong|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
nt|lestergold: any suggestions as to how e/w may have improved upon thios auction?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kiwibridge: 2D initially by E|pg||
nt|chick: W didn't open in the other room, so when E came in with a diamond bid, was much easier |pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|raghavan: East should have bid2D over 1 Heart because W is short in Hearts and may have Diamond 3 cards atleast|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: With defence on top -1|pg||
nt|lml: with the diamond lead the @sj from dummy might have been a better idea|pg||
nt|lml: the key was the play to trick 2 really|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|raghavan: D|pg||
pc|d3|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am told that only the cuebid is forcing in Norway|pg||
nt|raghavan: E has 11 points for a 2 level bid|pg||
nt|layzi: -1 now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|raghavan: very well played|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx for information|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=09monlag  for participants and standings after 2 rounds |pg||
nt|raghavan: India scotland, Australia,NZ do follow British style|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Where the cuebid more typically shows a good raise|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree Rag aqt the end of the day it was too dangerous not to bid 2d immediately|pg||
nt|chick: yes Rag, when you are stacked in the opener's suit and have a suit of your own, should overcall because partner always has support|pg||
nt|lestergold: and here partner needs to know thatyuou have the values to make a forcing 2 level bid|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lml: South is happy with one down which is where this is headed|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|raghavan: yes that is what we play too|pg||
nt|lestergold: just in case he opened minimum/light|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|raghavan: free overcall at 2 level is forcing|pg||
nt|chick: this isn't looking so good for NS now, probably -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: at end of day you cannot afford opponents ot play in a making part score when you have a game on this will cost even non vul 11 hefty imps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but still 11imps in|pg||
nt|chick: so not as big a swing as it might have been|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry didnt watch play how did theymanage to head for one off|pg||
nt|layzi: think it looks good enyway:)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|sao: so that 6@s give 11 imps to rubb og stubb|pg||
nt|vugraphzuj: W is still thinking... |pg||
nt|chick: yes, the double was what really made it a big swing|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: yes of course 5dims being doubled it was a matter of either 11 imps or12 imps making or going off not making much differenc|pg||
nt|layzi: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/Default.asp?Fil=09monlag|pg||

nt|vugraphzuj: last board in this match|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Hauge need to get this to game somehow - they need the imps|pg||
nt|lml: that one was an obvious loss :)|pg||
nt|sao: yes|pg||
nt|lml: you mark that on your scorecard -11 and circle it|pg||
nt|lml: at least I do|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think that W played N with the longer @s after the lead and therefore a small from the table|pg||
nt|lml: I find that lets me forget it and go on|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a good pick up|pg||
nt|raghavan: why Open room scores are slow to come?|pg||
nt|chick: maybe they are still on the 5th board :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sao: hauge might get som back on the board they missed 6@s|pg||
nt|sao: and they did|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think e/w can improve on the open room result which as in my view an extraordinary overbid by east|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: funny way to be even|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: E figured that out :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kiwibridge: at the start of this match Telemark were leading and Gota were in 6th|pg||
nt|raghavan: I think a good judgement whatever the final result|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2N should make altho not without its problems|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: the club spinter didn't help south |pg||
pc|s6|nt|layzi: well done|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well done! The play should not take long|pg||
nt|lml: I might start a trump on Nitter's hand.  It doesn't help|pg||
nt|lml: And he thought the same way|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|raghavan: Open room bid 3Spade only made 4 Here they will make 4 a swing|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|nt|ralfwil: I don´t understand 2nt from S. What more than 4@h?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Don´t tell defence too much|pg||
nt|vugraphzuj: 2N is forcing, asking|pg||
nt|lml: what if North shows a singleton spade could slam be there then|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|raghavan: Lasse - you were silent all along ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after having showed a minimum with 2@h?|pg||
nt|lml: same hand but stiff spade and @CA instead of spade honors|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards are fairly favourable for declarer|pg||
nt|haans: Welcome all to NBF Bridgefestival http://bridgefestival.no/ |pg||
nt|vugraphzuj: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=09Monlag|pg||
nt|haans: Swiss teams, three rounds to go (7 boards)|pg||
nt|vugraphzuj: 2 rounds to go|pg||
nt|lestergold: no probs now and more imps into he Telemark pot|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: are there time penalties for slow play?|pg||
nt|lestergold: about 5 i think|pg||
nt|haans: Hi to my co-comms  Cornelia(Chick) Yoder and Gary Hanna|pg||
nt|vugraphzuj: no, quick playing here|pg||
nt|lestergold: south probably has a seious reason for a tank|pg||
nt|chick: strange ... in the other room, they played boards 22-28,  we played 21-27|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c2|nt|lml: I grant it is unlikely but if someone has a gadget they just want to use it|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North may try a 4th heart, which would work brilliantly if South had the singleton 10 of spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: shoul he set up spades for then defence giving declarer an extra trickin the process?|pg||
nt|chick: so maybe 8 boards a round?|pg||
nt|vugraphzuj: no, both rooms played 22-28|pg||
nt|lestergold: it may for all south knows be declarer's 9 th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzuj: this is board 28|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: but still 2 red aces missing|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: 8 th trick i meant to type|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|lml: true.  It is hard to construct a minimum hand that makes slam even with a perfect fit|pg||
nt|lml: nice defense|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: pitch a @s|pg||
nt|chick: so the bd 21 "passed out" is extraneous|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|lml: Nitter might as well try a spade|pg||
nt|lml: but a diamond is better|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: yep|pg||
