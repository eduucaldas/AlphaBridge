mb|p|nt|sharynr: 1st board a push|pg||

nt|haans: 6@S please|pg||
mb|1H|nt|haans: how to make opps pass|pg||
nt|garnetts: Interesting choice by East--but if 1@C is nebulous it is probably best to pass|pg||
nt|haans: 7@H good sac|pg||
nt|petergill: Blair might bid 5@C or 5@D or 5@H, I'm not sure which|pg||
nt|sybarra: there is the lead director |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: not right|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we're back|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@C cue is his choice, as a slam try|pg||
nt|petergill: Blair is on lead to @s, so it is not lead directing|pg||
mb|1N|nt|garnetts: I really do not like that with only four hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: true sorry |pg||
nt|petergill: Luke bids 6@C, in case they have a 4-4 club fit with his @d losers able to be discarded on the long @H's |pg||
nt|haans: looks like 6@S will be the end|pg||
nt|petergill: Andy Hung now thinks that partner has @D's!|pg||
nt|haans: after a cue cannot sac|pg||
nt|petergill: The lack of entries to dummy makes the play of @H contracts difficult|pg||
nt|haans: if hung x no 6@S|pg||
nt|petergill: Andy Hung is one of the stars of Australian youth bridge - he has won international youth events such as the Pacific Asia Teams playing for Australia|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: what would you bid Hans, with east hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: another boring board|pg||

nt|don paulus: interesting lead for declarer|pg||

mb|3C|nt|haans: E make NS not bid slam?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: maybe it means i have jacks|pg||
nt|sharynr: one needs to HAVE the minors to show them at the 3 level, with no HCP|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no doubt on lead of A@S only|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Information.htm  for the tournament website, but Service Unavailable quite frequently I am sorry to say|pg||
nt|santyclz: A good hand for contructive jump shifts, a treatment we seldom see in the US.|pg||
nt|haans: after S pass you can act knowing THEY have game|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 4@D is better than 4@H here as it suggests defensive cards and helps West guage what to do if NS continue|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the web site seems unreachable whilst play is lon :(|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry that we cannot access the website so have to rely on locals at Yeditepe University in Istanbul providing info to us. |pg||

nt|haans: and N have found a lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: you have no reason to lead clubs|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|haans: a very easy grand to bid|pg||

pc|hA|pg||

pc|cA|pc|h4|nt|petergill: Jorrit Schafer from Belgium does not double, in case 6@S or 6NT is makeable|pg||

nt|sybarra: to me,  3 @S would have been the "bigger" slam interest hand |pg||

nt|petergill: 2@D = one long major|pg||

pc|h9|nt|kiwibridge: here is the bad news|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or had a go at 6@C only failing on the awful break|pg||
pc|h7|nt|petergill: multilandy = 2@C for majors (Landy) and 2@D like a multi two opening, with 2M = 5+M and either 4+minor|pg||

nt|ritong: 5@s would be a bit ridiculous, though|pg||

mb|6H|nt|lestergold: yeh well done they got there|pg||
nt|ritong: an achievement|pg||

mb|d|nt|lestergold: there a re a lot of dim losers to be taken care of here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: kibs who say it is 7@H C sorry i disagree in here 7@H is veryyyyyyy likely to go down|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rgdruru: -6|pg||
nt|lestergold: its looking like 5 down|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||

nt|lestergold: 1100 against 1430 thats healthy gain|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||

mc|7|nt|lestergold: well i dont think we would have seen 6s bid in the open game too often|pg||
nt|lestergold: -6 its hardly worth the effort|pg||
nt|rgdruru: at least they won 1 imp |pg||
nt|lestergold: open game hopes to beat the slam and worried about phantom disasters|pg||
nt|vugraphzut: now they are counting how many downs|pg||

nt|garnetts: No point in having a gadget if you use it and ignore it |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, yet one slip defence it could have made|pg||
nt|garnetts: death trap for NS here |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: north seems excited with his hand:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes could get too high in @D|pg||
nt|petergill: I think South should duck the first spade, that solves the problem, as declarer will surely play the king. |pg||
nt|haans: no but 3nt with 16 hcp after a jump?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: north pitched a club .so it makes +2|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|haans: yes 0-0|pg||
nt|sybarra: if angry probably at himself |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: south i mean|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|don paulus: no big swing this board|pg||
nt|garnetts: hard not to|pg||
nt|haans: here we may fi9nd why 3nt. they use Big Clubs|pg||
nt|haans: so 3@H was weaker that i belived|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|cherdano:  so would be a good safe, but only if you are sure 6@S is making|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: against 6 @S i meant|pg||
nt|cherdano:  yes|pg||
nt|cherdano:  3@H is probably a mixed raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: east is very aggresive player|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the web site is down again but here it is http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Istanbul.htm|pg||

nt|don paulus: 6 @h now ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  sorry|pg||
nt|cherdano:  preemptive|pg||
nt|sharynr: the OR tried 6@h on bd 14, failing for an 11 imps loss|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's a beaut hand sad break|pg||
nt|ybob: win 13 tricks|pg||
nt|rgdruru: 7@h i think|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|garnetts: but not now after only 1@D --what do you need these days for 2@C opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  i would just bid 2@H at red/white and with @SKxxx|pg||
nt|sybarra: do they play wk nt Peter? |pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharynr: i think east REALLY likes to bid!|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yeah.very|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Bd 5: Luke Gardiner gave correct upside down count in @d's with @D7, and playing a heart back instead of a club was reasonable, so no need for a post mortem. |pg||
mb|4S!|nt|haans: correct bid as per Blue team in the 60th|pg||
nt|sharynr: would be nice to have DBL mean "takeout or leave it in partner, you can do both"|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: no big decisions|pg||
nt|haans: soon @D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@S on the 4-3 was very well done other room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H 4@S NS-another flat I think|pg||
nt|haans: to slow to show spade void |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: OR did go via 1@S but still reached 4@H last one|pg||
nt|sybarra: same auction as other table |pg||
mb|5H!|nt|kiwibridge: or a failing 3N :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: takes the punt ouch|pg||
nt|petergill: 10-12 NT at this vul and position|pg||
nt|sybarra: thus the @D opening |pg||
nt|ybob: 4@S exclusion 5@H 2+Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Not that bad a bid just that bad a result|pg||
nt|ybob: now 7@H|pg||
nt|haans: are you sure?|pg||
nt|ybob: 99 %|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ybob: can E bid 5@H if 4@S cue ????|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another flat board I think|pg||
nt|ybob: maybe regular KCA|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  declarer has to be a bit careful here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D lead difficult|pg||
nt|petergill: Good lead by Andy Hung, better than say @DK|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 4th highes from longest suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: often works|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kiwibridge: 6@D is confusing|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another swing|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|haans: all cards wrong for declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: except @HJ10|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|rgdruru: Incredible since they stay in 6|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|sharynr: the Dutch women (Girls?) have taken the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: played 8 of spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: and now he is sad:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: have a lot of sympathy---the 6@D bid shows character and understanding |pg||
nt|garnetts: Should get the clubs right after this |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Strange defense Likely to end play himself|pg||
nt|santyclz: Quite.  Doesn't quite do it for declarer though.|pg||
nt|haans: they have to go back home and have a little talk|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|rnmalik: 8 tricks only|pg||
nt|petergill: but the contract figures to fail, after this good lead and good defence, I think|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|cherdano:  now EW can get a trump promotion|pg||
nt|cherdano:  with @SK and three rounds of diamond|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|haans: spade 8 was a little to much|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: how to get them right?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kiwibridge: 10 imps again|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I love these short matches lots of swings great stuff|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ybob: but if 4@S was normaly KCA its a wrong bid|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|cherdano:  but the @D pitch prevents that|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|haans: still down|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|petergill: @H to 9 was the winning play if you can see all 52 cards, as we can|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d8|nt|rnmalik: do or die stuff-one swing to win the match:)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|haans: just about|pg||
nt|haans: why did W never polay @D?|pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, with the other hand dummy, an innocent enough @HJ switch by the Argentinian East allowed the contract to make|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well that solved it|pg||
nt|haans: was close|pg||
nt|petergill: West deduced perhaps that there was no rush to play @D's|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzus: need to return a club after @d 10 to get promotion|pg||
pc|c8|nt|haans: played clubs  late|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: he has a typical hand for that|pg||

nt|ritong: he knows to double 4 NT to annoy opponents, but not to double 4@s with obvious bad news for them, eh?|pg||
nt|lestergold: im inclined to give that a message with south with three tricks in my 7 point hand i do n ot think tyhis is making and it certainly isnt being redoubled|pg||
nt|rgdruru: brescoll should x this, with 3 certain tricks and a bidding that didnt show much hcp|pg||
nt|rgdruru: pd is bound to have something|pg||
nt|lestergold: yesd a limited auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzut: Owen asking something to  Yoshiro|pg||
nt|jaapfr: b15 without any struggle they are not landing in a perfect normal slam and b16 they are figting like hell with a 6@HC against an 1imp win 6@S-6 pff|pg||
nt|lestergold: you have to take these opportunities it should have been doubled in the other room i u dont souble uexpect to lose imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: not very bloodthirsty for a junior|pg||
nt|ritong: i think there is this exact hand as an example of opportune doubling in SJ Simon's " why you lose at bridge"|pg||

nt|garnetts: No reason for South to even think|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  West is tempted to double for takout?|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: well passed S guess hes seen pards weak 2's before:)|pg||

nt|petergill: diverse team ever in the history of bridge|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cherdano:  if he had doubled, EW could get to 4@H|pg||

nt|don paulus: what scared him off ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: and south is about to bid 3nt with good spots|pg||
nt|haans: clubs lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  North has an easy pass of 2@C|pg||
nt|haans: pass on 2@D are S serious|pg||
nt|haans: that is something to talk about|pg||
nt|don paulus: if not - switch will follow|pg||
nt|garnetts: Just as an aside--the recommended lead is the A@D |pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, it is tough on BBO when you are playing strong players and things don't go your way|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzus: again 5-1 trumps|pg||

mb|4S|nt|rnmalik: 3 losers only|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: at least we have youth playing which is a great thing|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  so NS will score an easy +130|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  where as double would have gotten EW to a making @H partial, or game|pg||
nt|cherdano:  it doesn't usually pay to let opponents play 2@C when you are 5-5 in the unbid suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: played k|pg||
nt|haans: not easy to find|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: i assume 1H did show 5 spades|pg||

nt|don paulus: will bid 4 @h ?|pg||
nt|ybob: probably 4@H -2 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Andy finding the spades and minor bid "amuzing" |pg||
mb|1D!|nt|haans: 3 controls (A=2 K=1)|pg||
nt|haans: they will not find @D|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Marshall Lewis|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|don paulus: hi marshall|pg||
nt|haans: hi Marshall|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I met and spoke with Zia in 1976 -  awesome|pg||
nt|2celik1: i will take care on Kiwis by tomorrow Gary|pg||
nt|haans: having 14 hcp 3 have already bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: 1 think I admire about young players is there very quick decisions|pg||
nt|haans: you came to a GRAND|pg||
nt|don paulus: we saved a grand for you :)|pg||
nt|haans: good opps bidding|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is a lot of spades to bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: Also some practiced pairs reverse their normal lead structure against pre-empts--K from AK and the lead of an ace requires an attitude signal|pg||
nt|sybarra: does he X?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he is thinking|pg||
nt|petergill: in Adams' 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - answer to the ultimate question about the meaning of life = 42, for those even more illiterate than me |pg||
nt|haans: does W let is stand|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|vugraphzus: and passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @H forcing?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure he wants to give the hand away |pg||
nt|petergill: Operator, are you sure that East di not dbl?|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|cherdano:  declarer will probably take this trick, cross to a diamond, and take a spade finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: or "bettering" the contract, same level |pg||
mb|1N!|nt|santyclz: Discussion hand.  In your partnership does the 2@h bid imply @d support or tend to show @d shortage?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I wouldnt  with E east hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes|pg||
nt|haans: if he pass W cannot bid anymore|pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: keeps ops out of 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: i think east should ask rkcb with 4nt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure that 4S did anything to keep them out of 7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: man overboard here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Is west getting desperate ?  4@H ?  |pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Basar|pg||
nt|haans: call it tactical|pg||
nt|ybob: 1NT 2@C 2@H 4@H ?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sharynr: another overbid|pg||
nt|haans: but are not W to fault pass on 1@C makeable|pg||
nt|sharynr: was 1@C not forcing?|pg||
nt|haans: maybe all bid are forcing|pg||
nt|sharynr: seems both bids alerted|pg||
nt|haans: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: west always puts cards over board when he is dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: indeed discussion |pg||
nt|haans: are opener bidding all forcing bids|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|petergill: @HJ - that's good news and bad news, thinks South - the good news is that I'm not doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  giving him 8 tricks|pg||
nt|sharynr: is west the only male at the table?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes:)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|don paulus: 3 nt makes with @d lead :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: excellent J@C|pg||
nt|garnetts: Great card by South|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H first natural bid by opener|pg||
nt|haans: even Big Clubs are changing|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
nt|haans: will not like were clubs honor are|pg||
nt|sharynr: she pretty much needs the @CA onside to make, and @D 3-3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rnmalik: The system they are playing. If 2@D natural then 2@H natural too|pg||
nt|sybarra: since not match points,  why bother with jxx of @D |pg||
pc|c5|nt|rnmalik: Did you meet Masood Salim, his Partner. Walking computer|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we've lost some comparisons in that break|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: i will put in scores shortly|pg||
nt|garnetts: maximum hurt here now n|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I was scoring at the far eastern in Auckland 1976, Zia in black velvet and much gold chains|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NS on the ball and well rewarded|pg||
nt|garnetts: Self inflicted wound though|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kiwibridge: a magnet for the ladies :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: losing finesse |pg||
nt|rnmalik: swing as it is|pg||
nt|sybarra: adding to  NL lead here |pg||
pc|s3|pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what was 2S? 3 controls?|pg||
nt|haans: i do not belive 4nt was an option for E|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzus: west seems upset after looking at dummy|pg||
nt|haans: i do belibve that 3 controls|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|don paulus: do not like singelton trump lead - but other leads may give a trick away|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|haans: many play 1@H to be semi-relay natural or stronger|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|cherdano:  well declarer had other ideas|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh yes but important to extract the max damage|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not a great save against a likely NS partscore|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cherdano:  but he will always get 8 tricks on this layout|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|nt|haans: doing good|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: Ducking @S6 to the ten was correct play - when trump control is an issue, North's @SA must be retained at all costs for as long as possible in order to retain some control of the ...|pg||

nt|vugraphzus: after 4nt he can ask extras with 5nt .and he will get @d K for grand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then W should bid 5N as a grand slam try over 5H. not practical to play it specifically as Josephine by 2C opener|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we are playing 10 boards here.|pg||
nt|petergill: so this is a good board for New Zealand (NS)|pg||
nt|haans: natural to bid 4@H going down|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzus: and threw it|pg||
nt|sharynr: :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Really, e ducked the @s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  EW should get to 4@H here|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt it |pg||
nt|rnmalik: CR @S lead and no@D finesse 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: @C lead |pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|petergill: so the score soon will be 31-12 or 31-8 I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 3@C best bid|pg||
nt|sharynr: agree|pg||
nt|haans: do not understand what 4@S mean?|pg||
nt|petergill: Anticipating 4@H by EW, Norh takes the advance save with a keen eye on the vulnerability|pg||
nt|don paulus: surprising result on board 16 : 6 @s X !|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sharynr: should not expect a @S fit |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks Basar, hard for you when we lose connection|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no swings here then|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: its ok |pg||
nt|rnmalik: short and sweet-no trouble for us.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Operator, please check the result on bd 28.  It looked to be -1.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes pl|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt coming up some how |pg||
nt|haans: in teori thay have 3nt EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: you can play 5nt as Q ask|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we appreciate your efforts :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: u welcome:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: does W sit?|pg||
nt|haans: do you agree with that peter?|pg||
nt|petergill: His mother makes the same sorts of pressure bids when she plays with me - putting max pressure on EW early in the bidding, giving EW the last guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am not sure W can sit |pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H is cold for 620|pg||
nt|haans: go back on hand. DID YOU p X THEN?|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Not that it makes much of an imp difference.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S looks likt transfer to clubs |pg||
nt|petergill: West might take the Dbl as values instead of pure penalty|pg||
nt|petergill: as he has done!|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 2@C = any game force?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good old gazillie|pg||
nt|don paulus: - 6 = 1400 wins an imp :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cherdano:  and meanwhile 5 IMPS to Italy, as North found a more successful @H lead at the other table|pg||
nt|haans: can anyone tell all scores|pg||
pc|hT|nt|haans: she did not jump|pg||
nt|sharynr: Once again, a touch too high|pg||
nt|petergill: A good coup by Luke Gardiner, making EW guess, and they have now guessed wrongly|pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: but no jumping from E :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: too bad, 3nt would have been better|pg||
nt|don paulus: good action by S|pg||
nt|haans: all i can say is HOLY ...|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe. 2H going down. in my view it is better and safer to act initially on the S hand|pg||
nt|haans: me 2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: even in this sequence-looking for @S check I think|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kiwibridge: looks like Noname have a decent win here barring a disaster on 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: S not wanting N to bid again!|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzus: passed 3nt |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: strange|pg||
nt|sybarra: that lead doesnt hurt |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: this is quite fun table|pg||
pc|h8|nt|cherdano:  2N 18-19 balalnced, 3@D transfer, 3@S superaccept i assume|pg||
nt|garnetts: slam needs both major suits to break 3-2 with an extra residual chance in spades and the club ace right or led |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: and some more greek speech |pg||
nt|sybarra: that could be right also |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cherdano:  after @CAK and seeing the heart break, declarer can endplay South|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: seems that way.i couldnt read notes|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cherdano:  so he won't need the @D finesse|pg||
nt|sharynr: yes, kib suggests a trump back to let declarer do all the owrk|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petergill: The vulnerability was vital to North's decision to bounce the auction. He knew EW have 8+ @H's if South has only 4 spades. |pg||
pc|c5|nt|sharynr: work*|pg||
nt|don paulus: would you then prefer 2 @c over dbl ? with only 3 @s ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably not going to mess around much here |pg||
pc|d2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|don paulus: very close match apart from board 11|pg||
nt|don paulus: sry 12|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|petergill: Good comeback by New Zealand - they got 800 (the max) for 12 imps on the last board|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|haans: yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i prefer double, since S lacks club ten|pg||
nt|haans: x of 2@H usually mean no spades|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s5|pc|cT|nt|petergill: since with 4/4 in majors South would respond 1@H|pg||

pc|s2|nt|haans: an original match|pg||

nt|ritong: well, rodrigo, we hope they avoid it|pg||
