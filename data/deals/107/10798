nt|ralfwil: 5@d on NS|pg||
nt|chick: well, never mind that, apparently a different system :)|pg||
nt|chick: a canape type bid instead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: aggressive opener has much going for it, though pass would of course also be moe than acceptable|pg||

nt|vugraphzus: hi all welcome|pg||
nt|wygbe1: this should make|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi Basar|pg||
nt|han: 1S - 2H -p- p - p seems a normal auction|pg||
nt|han: the only alternative would be a 1NT overcall by east|pg||
nt|sybarra: N is mtvesuvius on bbo |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Some kind of war between systems|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: hi all welcome|pg||

pc|h6|nt|kiwibridge: 2@D is a horrible bid|pg||
nt|iris100:  made 12 tricks in the open room|pg||
nt|iris100:  11|pg||
nt|iris100:  only small @S lead (not very likely) holds it to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|wygbe1: south can do the same by winning in hand, cashing d ace, and leading a spade - setting up the spade suit with ruffs, as h are 22|pg||
nt|april7: hi everybody and good afternoon|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: hi all|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi all|pg||

nt|haans: and rightly so|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|petergill: I have partnered North, South and East at the bridge table. |pg||
nt|chick: these are difficult hands to bid, both sides with about half the points, but long suit fits|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello Basar :)|pg||

pc|s2|nt|don paulus: hi hans & basar|pg||
nt|haans: fast players|pg||
nt|petergill: Andy Hung from Australia might be inspired to try a crafty switch to a heart (like a man with no king) or perhaps @DJ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A @s shift is needed now|pg||
nt|chick: I probably should say, ... difficult hands to stop bidding :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: south is asking questions now to His screenmate(A.HUDSON)|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|haans: hi sharyn|pg||
nt|rnmalik: from the bidding it is evident that it is a complete misfit|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Salam Basar|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: hi rashed|pg||
nt|andyv:  despite E major suit holdings and N's revealing bid, E still plunged into game|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|haans: did go a little to mhigh here|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: E needs to attack dummys trumps. this problem was totally foreseeable by N, and is part of why 4S was such an......imprudent bid (feel free to substitue the adjective of your ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: choice)|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sharynr: hi haans :)|pg||
