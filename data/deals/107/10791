nt|ralfwil: 5@d on NS|pg||
nt|chick: well, never mind that, apparently a different system :)|pg||
nt|chick: a canape type bid instead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: aggressive opener has much going for it, though pass would of course also be moe than acceptable|pg||

nt|wygbe1: this should make|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi Basar|pg||
nt|han: 1S - 2H -p- p - p seems a normal auction|pg||
nt|han: the only alternative would be a 1NT overcall by east|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Some kind of war between systems|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: hi all welcome|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|kiwibridge: 2@D is a horrible bid|pg||
nt|iris100:  made 12 tricks in the open room|pg||
nt|iris100:  11|pg||
nt|iris100:  only small @S lead (not very likely) holds it to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|wygbe1: south can do the same by winning in hand, cashing d ace, and leading a spade - setting up the spade suit with ruffs, as h are 22|pg||

nt|vugraphzus: hi all|pg||

nt|haans: and rightly so|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: I have partnered North, South and East at the bridge table. |pg||

pc|h5|nt|don paulus: hi hans & basar|pg||
nt|haans: fast players|pg||
nt|petergill: Andy Hung from Australia might be inspired to try a crafty switch to a heart (like a man with no king) or perhaps @DJ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A @s shift is needed now|pg||
nt|chick: I probably should say, ... difficult hands to stop bidding :)|pg||

pc|dT|nt|haans: hi sharyn|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Salam Basar|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: hi rashed|pg||
nt|andyv:  despite E major suit holdings and N's revealing bid, E still plunged into game|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|haans: did go a little to mhigh here|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: E needs to attack dummys trumps. this problem was totally foreseeable by N, and is part of why 4S was such an......imprudent bid (feel free to substitue the adjective of your ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: choice)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sharynr: hi haans :)|pg||
nt|petergill: It is very exicting for us downunder that two of our three teams are charging up the leaderboard and thus meet here, both teams running about 5th now of the 40 teams. |pg||

nt|haans: but spade look good|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this should make comfortably now|pg||
nt|sybarra: NED girls right on the edge |pg||
pc|sA|nt|iris100:  good save in 5@C|pg||

nt|vugraphzus: some greek speech in table|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I believe it :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: 11 lines available on that hand and they all end with 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|haans: hi Paul|pg||
nt|ybob: 4@S looks fine|pg||
nt|han: North played his lowest spade every time|pg||
nt|han: so I think south was wrong to play a diamond|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if he'd played @D earlier the no @S loser but worried about @C's|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes had some options |pg||
nt|chick: so a push board and lost opportunity|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The defence is wide awake - took all their tricks|pg||
nt|april7: now S could have made an overtrick|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Aotearoa is Kuke Gardiner from Wanganui, NZ, Blair Fisher from Hamilton NZ, Michael Whibley from New Zealand, and Michael's partner is from Argentina. |pg||
nt|petergill: Luke|pg||
nt|wygbe1: light opening by east|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Jaap Frijling|pg||

nt|chick: Hi Jaap :)|pg||
mb|1C!|an|11-20 nat or 18-20 bal. or  +21|nt|haans: do not hard cards for 6@D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: part score here. NS may reach 4@H but.....................|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a quiet part score to let the nerves settle|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@S doubled in Open|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Board 1|pg||
mb|3H|nt|don paulus: another 3 nt - EW this time|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|don paulus: y favourable @c split|pg||
nt|sybarra: precision type 1 @D |pg||
nt|chick: yes, if @Cs were 4-4, he could lose the @DQ, @SJ and @C for -1.  in the end, I think he just figured that was true no matter how he played, and just finessed and hoped|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi Roland Ralf and Cornelia:)|pg||
nt|don paulus: no big events on this board i expect|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@S has possibilities here|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@c the most rational contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|iris100:  in first seat vul. ... I donÂ´t like it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: any 11 will do not my cup of tea|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Hello all, Gary, Martin.|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder who thinks they have tricks?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Anyone know what the  2@H bid promised?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|haans: what is showing and what is asking|pg||
nt|don paulus: NS may compete in majors - could be good result - if - 3 dbl = only 500|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now with stiff@DK S willbe tempted to bid 4@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: X by S 2@S by W should end it|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Joe WLC|pg||
nt|don paulus: may pass out now|pg||
nt|sybarra: not mine either |pg||
nt|chick: it's at least a point short of opening by my standards, too|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: west alerted its majors|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can vote for 2@C or 1nt:)?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Morning Rashed|pg||
nt|sybarra: no clue|pg||
nt|andyv:  good barrage by E/W|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Pass would do them good.|pg||
nt|haans: i do not say 2@S is bad bridge |pg||
nt|sybarra: and such great spots!!  (not)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I like W bid either |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a system mistunderstanding then and now in the mire|pg||
nt|chick: certainly not if it means majors :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: director is called|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a nice simple 3nt for me to start ith?|pg||
nt|don paulus: N still some action ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Very pleasant morning to all of you|pg||
nt|andyv:  4N here would be pick a minor...but does N have enough?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|haans: must still find @DJ|pg||
nt|sharynr: i don't see the N-S team on the roster of players|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wow game made other room|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Rahed, don't think we've met.|pg||
nt|haans: close between 2 and 3|pg||
nt|haans: clubs right dim right|pg||
nt|han: nice bid by North here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Basar is our operator and he's a great one :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree!  worked with him yesterday |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he should pass this|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would you give a try for 3NT by E|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But will probably venture 3NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D lead by S would hurt.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes @D sinks it|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: ý heard like  "min. hand and no 4 cards @H"  on 2@D alert|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: that is my choice|pg||
nt|santyclz: (Rashed), sry.|pg||
nt|haans: spade right|pg||
nt|han: only 12 HCP but such good shape and suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: ty:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if W thought the 2 @D was michaels?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: director is just watching bidding now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with @H lead he makes (she)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Salam Basar, thanks for the info|pg||
mb|5C|nt|haans: an other fast claim?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: We are meeting now:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: We can guess, any game force, bal min, relay, ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think Visser can bid 3 nt now |pg||
nt|petergill: The Argentina youth flew from Argentina to New Zealand, then to Turkey, so is probably the most travelled competitor in the field. |pg||
nt|wygbe1: i also would have passed|pg||
nt|iris100:  tough lead|pg||
nt|tweety1: hello every1|pg||
nt|han: Hi Veysel|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: sorry, I mean E-W|pg||
nt|don paulus: and @s ok if he finds Q|pg||
nt|iris100:  how many S will overcall 1@H do you think?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: and checking convention card|pg||
nt|jaapfr: Noname=? besides no name:)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzus: they started early .so i missed the first board s play.sorry.|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT looks safe, should make easily. |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: 4+@H.could be 5 @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: np|pg||
nt|haans: nothing to see or miss|pg||
nt|don paulus: we got the result - thats fine|pg||
nt|sybarra: tremendous number of frequent flyer miles!|pg||
nt|petergill: If played by East, a heart lead would shoot 3NT. |pg||
nt|han: East can now hold it to 4|pg||
nt|han: by playing a low heart|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a crazy auction to say the least :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Although 3NT would have been easier|pg||
nt|mcarroll: in danger of losing 3@Ss and @CA|pg||
nt|april7: thats an aggressive bidding,making on good dietsribution , but might go down if N takes first trick and continues @D so S with K of @S gives N a @D ruff through an uppercut|pg||
nt|april7: first @S trick though taking by N|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Ruud von Seida|pg||
nt|boedhy: hi all|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Ruud|pg||
nt|andyv:  well done.  Note that 5@h would have been the winning call for E/W|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rnmalik: must be bad defense-@S lead only helps|pg||
nt|andyv:  is S really taking this long?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: if S makes this .then we have a more enjoyable match|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes he is in the tank|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: sound polish|pg||

nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|iris100:  standard 4@S now|pg||

nt|haans: 6@S please|pg||
nt|han: the doubleton spade is about perfect for the double|pg||
nt|chick: 3N pretty solid again|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: how to make opps pass|pg||
nt|garnetts: Interesting choice by East--but if 1@C is nebulous it is probably best to pass|pg||
nt|haans: 7@H good sac|pg||
nt|petergill: Blair might bid 5@C or 5@D or 5@H, I'm not sure which|pg||
nt|sybarra: there is the lead director |pg||
nt|wygbe1: i would think south is worth 2s, and n has easy raise to 4|pg||
nt|han: I think 2S is a very bad call|pg||
nt|han: but E may know better|pg||
nt|chick: apparently so|pg||

mb|1S!|an|3!S|nt|haans: not right|pg||

nt|tweety1: dbl cld be better|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: I really do not like that with only four hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: true sorry |pg||
nt|petergill: Luke bids 6@C, in case they have a 4-4 club fit with his @d losers able to be discarded on the long @H's |pg||
nt|haans: looks like 6@S will be the end|pg||
nt|petergill: Andy Hung now thinks that partner has @D's!|pg||
nt|haans: after a cue cannot sac|pg||
nt|petergill: The lack of entries to dummy makes the play of @H contracts difficult|pg||
nt|haans: if hung x no 6@S|pg||
nt|petergill: Andy Hung is one of the stars of Australian youth bridge - he has won international youth events such as the Pacific Asia Teams playing for Australia|pg||

nt|chick: E showing his other suit|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sharynr: what would you bid Hans, with east hand|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: now the passed hand starts to push|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3nt?|pg||
nt|chick: if leb, this is an invitation by S|pg||
nt|sybarra: lebensohl requests pard to bid 3 @C and then will show suit |pg||
nt|chick: her* sorry :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: little bit of magic but hey....club ace on side, ht ace on side,  etc |pg||
mb|p|nt|han: this would make it easier for west to bid 4S though|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sure with helpful lead:)|pg||
nt|cindy:  6 @s is a little rich|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S or 5@C to expensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: nothing |pg||
nt|sybarra: nothing wrong with 5 clubs is there?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  1@s is not enough with South, maybe she was considering 3@s|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North will raise to game anyway|pg||
nt|iris100:  for a junior, 2@S is quite disciplined|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning Roland, Veysel, Han and everyone|pg||
nt|tweety1: hello Andy|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@C makes|pg||
nt|chick: this can be set, but sure not obviously enough to warrant a double|pg||
nt|cindy:  one fixed, stay fixed|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think 6@S too much bravery   agree?|pg||
nt|cindy:  once fixed|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: but close to something|pg||
nt|sharynr: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: forcing pass by Andy?|pg||
nt|haans: if NS find there 8 @H EW more likely to find spades|pg||
nt|don paulus: interesting lead for declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with @H lead much tougher|pg||
nt|chick: will certainly paint the picture of how to play it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too many losers for 6S. pd was under pressure. you want to REWARD him for making a winning competitve decision, not punish him|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Board 18|pg||
nt|andyv:  staying low on this hand is the trick|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 4@H here is down on a club lead or switch|pg||
pc|h8|nt|haans: 2-2 in M do not like|pg||
nt|rnmalik: but only 8 tricks on @D lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|chick: ummm, yes you are right, can set up hearts for the losing diamond|pg||
nt|imp_jan: ew elected to play in spades though|pg||
nt|andyv:  same problem here along with picking up @s suit and staving off @h ruffs|pg||
nt|imp_jan: yep, heart ruff coming up|pg||
nt|andyv:  no palatable line of play for W|pg||
nt|imp_jan: still a bit unlucky: @Hk and @Ca off side..|pg||
nt|andyv:  true|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: still thinking|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rnmalik: yes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we lost our score from board 2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1, if no defense error|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and got away with it|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: screen has gone down.declarer asking some questions|pg||
nt|santyclz: I wasn't recommending 3nt, but half expected it in a jr's game.|pg||
nt|tweety1: no excitement this brd  a draw|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petergill: Great 6@S bid by Andy Hung|pg||
nt|ybob: 8 tricks cold|pg||
nt|han: declarer worries about diamonds being 3-1|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|petergill: Note that even with two aces, Blair Fisher has the discipline not to double 6@S|pg||
nt|haans: does not need @DK right but no @D lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@S is a good sac over 5@C, won't get a good score tho :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sharynr: but looks like a good hand for vul save|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||

nt|petergill: Round 6 results in brackets|pg||
nt|sybarra: per spec:  juniors invite and later bid 5S|pg||
nt|chick: lebensohl did them in ... let E show his clubs and W then knows what to do :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|han: but there is little he can do about that|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this is what we like, lots of excitement|pg||
nt|rnmalik: unfavourable cards placement for W and 2@C|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|haans: did hung bid it to make?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kiwibridge: will be -1 in the end|pg||

pc|c5|nt|kiwibridge: it's going to be a high scoring match|pg||
nt|rnmalik: seems so|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Neth will go into lead as 3NT coming home on 2 - no @D lead|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for me its not even oprimarily about too rich or too brave. its about the effect of bids like 6S on partnership---W should WANT his pd to bid aggressively in these situations, and ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the way to encourage him to keep doing so is to give him some slack|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i saw as phantom 2x playing from dummy the clubs and 2x N AK and so developing @CJ as tr 11|pg||
pc|c8|nt|andyv:  10@c asked for @h shift|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c2|nt|kiwibridge: double swing = 9+ to noname|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||

pc|s4|nt|kiwibridge: defense error = 8+ to ckis|pg||

nt|han: Egypt and Noname are currently ranked 16th and 18th, and to get to the top 8 they could really need a big score this round|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: oh, I am sure it shows minors BUT....|pg||
nt|han: Egypt is 13 VPs behind, Noname 14|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i agree Marshall with yr analysis|pg||
nt|boedhy: 3NT doubled - 7 isnt the way to get back into the match....|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: E make NS not bid slam?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: maybe it means i have jacks|pg||
nt|sharynr: one needs to HAVE the minors to show them at the 3 level, with no HCP|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no doubt on lead of A@S only|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Information.htm  for the tournament website, but Service Unavailable quite frequently I am sorry to say|pg||
nt|santyclz: A good hand for contructive jump shifts, a treatment we seldom see in the US.|pg||
nt|haans: after S pass you can act knowing THEY have game|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A bit careless then as two clubs can be ruffed with @sK and @sJ, losing only to @sQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  these first few hands aren't helping either of them|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This can be fun!|pg||
nt|cindy:  like the lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: most people who find themselves in that situation automatically start rethinking their podition :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 4@D is better than 4@H here as it suggests defensive cards and helps West guage what to do if NS continue|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the web site seems unreachable whilst play is lon :(|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry that we cannot access the website so have to rely on locals at Yeditepe University in Istanbul providing info to us. |pg||
nt|haans: 3@C mean = do not lead clubs :)|pg||
nt|april7: everybody is bidding without values|pg||
nt|april7: I mean S and W|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kiwibridge: nothing to the play expecta quick claim|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry Peter,  missed you said 40 teams|pg||
nt|iris100:  that carelessness cost 13 IMPs|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A tricky 4@s for N/S on this one as well|pg||
nt|iris100:  4@C wont cheer N up|pg||
nt|chick: Must be terrible pressure on teenagers to know the whole bridge world is watching them play.   Then to add a disaster can only make it worse.  |pg||
nt|sybarra: frankly, these kids love it! |pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@H and 3NT make|pg||
nt|boedhy: nothing to bid with east |pg||
pc|s4|nt|kiwibridge: we may have a flat board at last|pg||
nt|petergill: 40 teams, including some U21 teams|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C mini splinter|pg||
nt|haans: but also a warning to opps|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: sorry for connection problem|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But there will be 2@d from S and 2@h fromE|pg||
nt|april7: also S should be a little stronger|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: can they miss now|pg||
nt|han: North has 11 HCP, but they look so bad|pg||
nt|han: it's tough to pass with 11 HCP though|pg||
nt|sybarra: you shouid have seen them at DC Nationals |pg||
nt|chick: maybe so, but it's still a lot of pressure|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'd think I would love it too, if only we could get the world youth watching|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes. After 2@C GF|pg||
nt|boedhy: probably 1 off..|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|don paulus: K @h counted as a key card - so = 2|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone know what 2N inquires?|pg||
nt|sybarra: especially now since many are out of school |pg||
nt|andyv:  same auction in OR|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: 5nt = all + Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: cant miss now|pg||
nt|don paulus: 2 of the remaining 3 kings now|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: should bid 7nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he did|pg||
nt|iris100:  I donÂ´t think this will make|pg||
nt|mcarroll: As does 5@C if follows the Rabbi's Law and drops singleton @CK|pg||
nt|sybarra: a splinter I approve of with good cards in outside suits |pg||
pc|cK|nt|haans: only bad if partner double|pg||
nt|ybob: 9@H is a nice card !!|pg||
nt|haans: and N have found a lead|pg||
nt|cindy:  making 3 i guess|pg||
nt|rnmalik: A@C safety play|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: you have no reason to lead clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: After 6 rounds, USA Blue lead on 130, Japan-Czech 2nd on 112 or 113 , Neth Red on 108, Greecour on 106, Italy Red 105, Aotearoa 102, 42 and others somewhere up there too|pg||
nt|han: I wonder what 3@c is, I would have bid 4@c with the south hand (splinter with 4 trumps) but maybe NS can show that hand in a different way|pg||
nt|han: Operator, can you find out what these bids mean for us?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a modest 1 imp for Noname i presume|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans: a very easy grand to bid|pg||
nt|haans: claim before 1st trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: a very fast match|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes but maybe North did not bid enough|pg||
pc|c8|nt|haans: it did mean expect 4-1 in all suits|pg||
nt|andyv:  S is only a 12 count and N did pass originally, so jumping to 4@c seems a bit optomistic|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: they are just whispering.cant hear them .sorry|pg||
nt|tweety1: 2nt shows strenght here i guess|pg||
nt|jaapfr: she likely hits@SAK for 9 and suddenly makes 12 tr lol|pg||
nt|cindy:  or more|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mcarroll: Yes|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|petergill: Jorrit Schafer from Belgium does not double, in case 6@S or 6NT is makeable|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rnmalik: acdemic discussion-you see any chance for 5@D|pg||
nt|haans: W has 18 hcp that is also hard to understand|pg||
nt|don paulus: 4 @c 2 @h 2 @s 1 @d|pg||
nt|han: yes good point Andy, in that case I would just bid 4@h|pg||
nt|han: I think it is impossible to stop in 3@h with the south hand once north moves over 2@h|pg||
nt|tweety1: 4 @c or +h may seem attractive but remember your pd is a passed hand|pg||
nt|tweety1: NS knows that they have 23 hp max|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: we do have an optimistic Blair today |pg||
nt|tweety1: umm 3 @c is a great bid then|pg||
nt|tweety1: N shd have stop at 3 level with a mass hand like his..|pg||
nt|han: I don't agree unless NS have a way to show a club splinter below 3@h, which I strongly doubt|pg||
nt|andyv:  have to play @hs for one loser...since W needs to be kept out of lead after @d shift, probably need to dbl hook the @hs|pg||
nt|tweety1: see the alert Han|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2@C 2@D and 1@S loser|pg||
nt|jaapfr: more than 12:)?|pg||
nt|andyv:  good thing E has J@h|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kiwibridge: 4-0 break|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=10  for standings after 10 rounds. First 8 after 13 rounds advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: tomorrow|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with their playstations etc if they could be shown what fun this  game is and you get to meet people all over the world|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharynr: i would think 5-0|pg||
nt|boedhy: because off the low bidding probably the @h were 2-2... |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes ideal hand for a splinter bid - especially having shown where the trick potential is |pg||
pc|c4|nt|kiwibridge: but still possible|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Looks like that|pg||
pc|dA|nt|haans: singel bids make it easy for defence  to defend. very rarely told|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|petergill: Blair's bidding was optimistic, and his card play excellent, when I partnered him in the San Francisco Nationals about 20 months ago. |pg||
nt|boedhy: there should be no problems in the defence|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzus: they rrelayed with 3@C and 3@D bids.to describe many hands.i just got a note|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
nt|tweety1: will be same -2 here too i bet:)|pg||
nt|tweety1: shldnt touch the trumps|pg||
nt|garnetts: hi all--sorry I am late connection failed|pg||
nt|tweety1: hi|pg||
nt|andyv:  S did not seem to have a plan on how to play the hand in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: screen went down and declarer is asking some questions to east now|pg||
nt|andyv:  and W shifted to the 10@d at trick 2 which I think poses a lot more problems for declarer than does @S shift|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he is still thinking|pg||
pc|d9|nt|cindy:  no more than 9 :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would have thought "fast arrival"  on 4 @S would have slowed S down |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|s8|nt|jaapfr: oeff kibs rite mite fail now|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|dT|nt|nigel_k:  It has chances still I think|pg||
nt|tweety1: playing the best line seems|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rnmalik: well played|pg||
pc|h8|nt|haans: i think 3@S was natural = u may pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: sometimes pard has the right cards |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|andyv:  not much to do here for W but keep even with dummy|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h2|nt|haans: 31C cannot have been gf|pg||
nt|sybarra: to me,  3 @S would have been the "bigger" slam interest hand |pg||
nt|cindy:  cashing i guess|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok 12|pg||
nt|don paulus: can go down now if @s finesse|pg||
nt|cindy:  for 12|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: Blair usually plays a Strong Club system, but when playing with Luke Gardiner or Luke's mother Val or me, he play our natural-based system|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now E has problems|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h5|nt|don paulus: extra @c now|pg||
pc|c6|nt|iris100:  how? @CQ doesnt hold|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: i guess 3 cl bid was pscyhic|pg||
nt|petergill: A bit lucky to drop only 5 imps there|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like a splinter to me |pg||
nt|haans: if psych you bid 3@D instead|pg||
nt|sybarra: or mini splinter, but I dont like it with Jxx of @D|pg||
nt|tweety1: all clear by defence now|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzus: he played jack|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|tweety1: :(|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: east has pitched a @D early .so it made +2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: suddenly 6 imps lol|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s3|pc|hA|nt|nigel_k:  Yes you're right|pg||
nt|andyv:  just too hard to untangle everything|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|iris100:  down 2|pg||
nt|iris100:  what happened? how did N make another trick?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  One extra diamond ruff in hand earlier and declarer could have made A9 of spades at the end|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|tweety1: hard to understand @d j|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzus: east and north are laughing after @C K drops|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good technique rewarded - as Rashad pointed out the @C A as a safety play works|pg||
nt|rnmalik: thanks:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: we are waiting for west now.he is in bathroom break|pg||

nt|marlowepi: not sure i would pass at any colors|pg||
nt|athene: no, true|pg||
nt|athene: maybe at favourable|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe|pg||
nt|athene: i am sure South is debating between double and 3NT |pg||
nt|marlowepi: then find pd with    xx   jxx    xxxxxx   Ax cold for 6D|pg||
nt|athene: is 2@S spades and a minor?|pg||
nt|athene: if so, she is worried about clubs|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: and she perhaps wants to put west on lead|pg||
nt|athene: because he might not be able to find the lead when east would|pg||
nt|marlowepi: whatever it means, E doesnt have that hand :)|pg||
nt|athene: she anticipates if she doubles, north will bid 2nt lebensohl|pg||
nt|athene: and wrongside 3nt|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: then east has the easy club lead with five good clubs|pg||

pc|h5|nt|athene: also she is facing a passed hand|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d9|pc|d7|nt|athene: so the chances of 6 of something in partner's long suit is going down|pg||

nt|garnetts: now even|pg||
nt|sybarra: and another push!|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Hans|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C was intended as a minisplinter, not interpreted thus because they are not a regular partnership|pg||
nt|ybob: 6@H here|pg||
nt|don paulus: slam time|pg||
nt|haans: down|pg||
nt|iris100:  true|pg||
nt|iris100:  first 2 IMPs to France|pg||
nt|andyv:  both rooms over evaluated the N hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  4 Queens is not 8hcp|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes squared it|pg||
nt|chick: that certainly didn't work out as well as it could have for declarer|pg||
nt|cindy:  thats a most ugly 12 N is holding|pg||
nt|jaapfr: where this ends??|pg||
nt|rnmalik: thought P might take @C finesse:)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: slam missed in cr|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: computer is in nasty mood, what hands|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NS have 4@S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: our kib from venuzuela made strait at start the correct analysis : develop 5th @S and endplay N to make it (if defense attacked trumps soon:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The mistake was to win the first @h return on the hand instead of the table to set up the @s|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|kiwibridge: yes a shapely lot with many traps for young players :)|pg||
nt|ybob: bad @H 5/1|pg||
nt|haans: all cards wrong|pg||
nt|jaapfr: rue|pg||
nt|jaapfr: t|pg||
nt|imp_jan: chance for jap-cz|pg||

nt|imp_jan: in north yes|pg||
mb|d|nt|ybob: win if 4/2|pg||
nt|haans: 1DQ wring @C 4-2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i even do not dare to quess|pg||
nt|cindy:  2@s i think|pg||
nt|imp_jan: difficult to get it there, though|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 2NT good raise|pg||
nt|petergill: I expect Andy Hung to bid spades now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@S CAN fail -2 for -500 so better let NS play 5@C for 400|pg||
nt|rnmalik: do we see 6@D for EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: get that 8 card suit in there!|pg||
nt|andyv:  N would be hard pressed to bid NT unless he pulled wrong bid out of box|pg||
nt|imp_jan: now there is a chance|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h by N|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3@H = constrcutive (lebensohl)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk5: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Information.htm  for the tournament website. Better link than the one before|pg||
nt|garnetts: Now ignore partner and go on|pg||
nt|chick: if so, they can pick up a lot of imps here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: % @D makes|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 5|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @D is gin|pg||
nt|imp_jan: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: an other boring board|pg||
nt|don paulus: can they stay out of slam ?|pg||
nt|haans: serenisima say 'doesnt happen only to me' and right you are :)))|pg||
nt|ybob: D. D. win 6@H|pg||
nt|iris100:  3SA now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same contract and play in Open so flat board - the level of technical ability is impressive|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Arend Bayer|pg||
nt|cherdano:  hello everyone|pg||
nt|rnmalik: brave bid of 2NT-no negative DBL|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: south alerted 3 cl but not north|pg||
nt|chick: good discipline by E|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very correct|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and 4@H (dbl?) is 2 off|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Juan from Argentina let 1NT go, but Andy bids 2@D Multilandy|pg||
nt|chick: its hard to give up on a suit like that one :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H and 5@Seak|pg||
nt|andyv:  they may still get to 6@hs|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jaapfr: w|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  do we know whether NS have an agreement about 4@H?|pg||
nt|sharynr: would 1NT not be enough?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes and 3@S?|pg||
nt|garnetts: very marginal game at best|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes |pg||
nt|garnetts: I think that North should bid 4@S ---very prime 17 for a suit|pg||
nt|chick: 11 IMPs if they make this |pg||
nt|sybarra: easy for us to see from here, mabe not easy at the table |pg||
nt|andyv:  4@c almost mandatory and should get them to 6|pg||
mb|4D|nt|haans: what would 1nt has showed|pg||
nt|haans: sry|pg||
nt|sharynr: this hand i believe|pg||
nt|garnetts: North would have done better to call 1@S and investigate over the 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good for morale : thanks pard I am min ; np I'll bid my hand again|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D = one long major|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt was massive bidding :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: but we have seen thay East likes to bid....so lets see how she plays now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no great number of @C tricks and entries will be few|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he write some notes.cant see it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 12 tricks without a @h shift|pg||
mb|4H|nt|cherdano:  good slam but not that easy to bid over the interference by EW|pg||
nt|rnmalik: to me it does not make-@H lead no entry no 3rd entry|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H pass or correct|pg||
nt|cindy:  5-2 fits usually play better than 4-3 fits|pg||
nt|jaapfr: they did what you asked Cindy (but il love the 4-3 fits)|pg||
nt|cindy:  :-)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: cue bidding i gather|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: This must be very exciting for the players, coming together to Istanbul!|pg||
nt|haans: may be hard for them to play their best bridge|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: needs @S switch now|pg||
nt|sybarra: the dbl gives som clues |pg||
nt|sybarra: but is it enough |pg||
nt|haans: multilandy are the hottest thing around just now|pg||
nt|tweety1: ah|pg||
nt|chick: I know we're not supposed to have favorites when commentating, but I sure can't help cheering for a 13 year old, regardless of country :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1 @D entry to play Q@S game over|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it depends on a lot of factors|pg||
nt|cindy:  it does|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true but imo the 4-3 highly underrated (generally)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|santyclz: Well, it can make.  W has to guess 4-1 rather than 5-0.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This can be 4 off|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with such @S holding short suit lead slightly not proper|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I can see the E hand as a weak 2 @H or a 2@H opening if playing it as @Hs and a minor (5-5) preferably - but not a first hand opening bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: but mb me too pessimistic and IF 5@S will S not be very much attempted to lead once a high @C:)?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And yet it needs a @C ruff to go down|pg||
nt|mcarroll: the transfer bid by S has made N declarer and E has an obvious @S lead - which is best|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 3  Drijver and Michielson bid on to 5 @C |pg||
nt|andyv:  checking for 7|pg||
mb|5C|nt|sybarra: I think the "girls" are not much old if at all |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good sacrifice|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he didnt cover 9 |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well done|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the cold 4@H was doubled for 7 away last board|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Easy nine tricks when diamonds break evenly and maybe 10 if declarer guesses which major suit finesse to take|pg||
nt|tweety1: refused 1 more imp:)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: in or michielsen bid 3n directly over a 2@s opener|pg||
nt|imp_jan: not impressed by that bid i am afraid|pg||
mb|6H|nt|cherdano:  and it was easily bid by Italy at the other table without interference|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: seems 7 |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: 7@d is good save |pg||
nt|sybarra: ML defense to nt is just like ML opening,  @D= one long major and 2 @C = stayman and 2 of either major is that  5 card of that major and a minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: here is the bad news|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or had a go at 6@C only failing on the awful break|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: multilandy = 2@C for majors (Landy) and 2@D like a multi two opening, with 2M = 5+M and either 4+minor|pg||
nt|haans: or 4 cards in M + longer minor|pg||
nt|petergill: I make a good echo. :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)  at least the specs now know |pg||
nt|sybarra: btw Ilike it also |pg||
nt|petergill: This should go down, especially if declarer plays a spade to the king (likely, normal)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: on this line -3 may even happen|pg||

nt|sybarra: although not sure what I would have done differently |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not sure that hurt |pg||
nt|santyclz: That eases the guess somewhat.|pg||
nt|andyv:  everyone loves to finesse|pg||
nt|andyv:  strip and endplay would have worked here|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N practical bid over a passed pd. but certainly doesn't allow any room for exploration|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sharynr: they will warm up soon|pg||
nt|mcarroll: only 3 off now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same contract in Open|pg||
nt|imp_jan: north has the tom to check the red suits first and later has the option to fall back on the club finesse (not necessary to due the break in diamonds)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: time (not tom)|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  will make 7... hand plays itself|pg||
nt|andyv:  N doesn't know that yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he seems he can think about 5 mins|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ralfwil: S has now 4 entrances to set up and cash @d willers|pg||
pc|s3|nt|don paulus: fell asleep ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all bad news for S now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: -2 I think|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I may be wrong but 2 @C with S would justify 2NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: W inserting the @H K muddied the waters nicely|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|sybarra: now can roll home |pg||
nt|sybarra: as long as declarer does try a early @D |pg||
nt|don paulus: complete misfit and "only" 31 pts|pg||
nt|don paulus: so 6 nt far away|pg||
nt|haans: wityh a good hearts = + at least 2 point to me|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: alternative give up 1 @S|pg||
nt|imp_jan: almost all ways lead to byzantium..|pg||
nt|andyv:  best seems to play A@h and @h|pg||
nt|andyv:  but @c back (if k@h is off) will force him to make an early decision|pg||
pc|d3|nt|don paulus: well - after 3nt by E - no reason for W to try slam ?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chick: anyone know the ages of EW?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ralfwil: winners (2 @s ruffs, 1 @c , and @hA)|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|haans: partner never lead from Q so play it if you have it|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not even that is required.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|boedhy: I agree Martin. But maybe if you and youre partner agree on it it will work |pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: seems wrong to me to play D queen|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

nt|garnetts: death trap for NS here |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: north seems excited with his hand:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes could get too high in @D|pg||
nt|petergill: I think South should duck the first spade, that solves the problem, as declarer will surely play the king. |pg||
nt|haans: no but 3nt with 16 hcp after a jump?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: north pitched a club .so it makes +2|pg||
nt|iris100:  quite boring boards - another standard game|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|haans: yes 0-0|pg||

nt|chick: I'm told that Dekkers is 25, Nab 21 ... thanks for the info to the kib who knew :)|pg||
nt|chick: partscores here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1@H-p-p- 1nt?-2@C-?|pg||
nt|sybarra: slam here now for n/s |pg||
nt|andyv:  28-3 for Jap-Cz this set and making this a very tight match|pg||
mb|d|nt|don paulus: no big swing this board|pg||
nt|garnetts: hard not to|pg||
nt|haans: here we may fi9nd why 3nt. they use Big Clubs|pg||
nt|haans: so 3@H was weaker that i belived|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They may think about slam on this one but need to identify the poor trumps|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H can make here but not bid :)|pg||
mb|1D!|an|!H|nt|cherdano:  so would be a good safe, but only if you are sure 6@S is making|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: against 6 @S i meant|pg||
nt|cherdano:  yes|pg||
nt|cherdano:  3@H is probably a mixed raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: east is very aggresive player|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the web site is down again but here it is http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Istanbul.htm|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I might have played @D 9 after @CA|pg||
nt|santyclz: Excellent idea.|pg||
nt|don paulus: 6 @h now ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is "old" in this tourney |pg||
nt|mcarroll: 7@D on|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to stay out of 2N|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 1@d = heart suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  sorry|pg||
nt|cherdano:  preemptive|pg||
nt|sharynr: the OR tried 6@h on bd 14, failing for an 11 imps loss|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's a beaut hand sad break|pg||
nt|ybob: win 13 tricks|pg||
nt|rgdruru: 7@h i think|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nab could have saved there with the double @C@H fit thx Pieter for pointing that out|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and then in all directions:)|pg||
nt|cindy:  dunno  2@c or dbl ?|pg||
mb|1H!|an|3cards !H|nt|garnetts: but not now after only 1@D --what do you need these days for 2@C opening|pg||
nt|chick: personally, I think it's too old to play as a junior, but I suppose there aren't enough 13-18 year olds to fill a tourney like this|pg||
nt|jaapfr: all cards very well placed|pg||
nt|chick: even 4@H depends on good lie of the cards|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even DD i do not know what to do as S now|pg||
nt|don paulus: Laura would like 2 @s by S :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: IMO W has a better 2@C overcall here than when he did overcalll a couple of boards ago|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure you can bid it |pg||
nt|mcarroll: 7NT even|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  i would just bid 2@H at red/white and with @SKxxx|pg||
nt|sybarra: do they play wk nt Peter? |pg||
nt|andyv:  smolen?|pg||
nt|tweety1: yes|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes any time|pg||
nt|sybarra: but they might |pg||
mb|2C!|nt|sharynr: i think east REALLY likes to bid!|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yeah.very|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this is the under 26 tourney not the under 21|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2 losers in either @S or @HS|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Bd 5: Luke Gardiner gave correct upside down count in @d's with @D7, and playing a heart back instead of a club was reasonable, so no need for a post mortem. |pg||
nt|garnetts: Good idea to upgrade here --even thogh it might not work out too well|pg||
nt|chick: is there an under-21 world tourney?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: adam is checking their convention card|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @dA as well as @hQ in front etc|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even unbeatable with any lead and any defense|pg||
nt|chick: even so, takes perfect play to make it, almost double dummy play|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|haans: correct bid as per Blue team in the 60th|pg||
nt|sharynr: would be nice to have DBL mean "takeout or leave it in partner, you can do both"|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: no big decisions|pg||
nt|haans: soon @D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@S on the 4-3 was very well done other room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H 4@S NS-another flat I think|pg||
nt|haans: to slow to show spade void |pg||
nt|iris100:  But as even 5@S makes|pg||
nt|cindy:  whats wrong with pass by S ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: oeff 2@H by W is guts|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Board 5 was flat|pg||
nt|lml: hello|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: OR did go via 1@S but still reached 4@H last one|pg||
nt|sybarra: same auction as other table |pg||
nt|boedhy: looks like slem values and both have reasonable hands but it is off offcourse on @d lead ....|pg||
nt|april7: good save in 5@D against 4@S but also 5@S makes, but no S nor N can compete in the bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Linda |pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c beginning of invite relay|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kiwibridge: or a failing 3N :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: takes the punt ouch|pg||
nt|petergill: 10-12 NT at this vul and position|pg||
nt|sybarra: thus the @D opening |pg||
nt|ybob: 4@S exclusion 5@H 2+Q|pg||
nt|cindy:  S has nothing to write home about|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Not that bad a bid just that bad a result|pg||
nt|ybob: now 7@H|pg||
nt|haans: are you sure?|pg||
nt|ybob: 99 %|pg||
nt|andyv:  will be much tougher to dble here than in OR where W opened with 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: can E bid 5@H if 4@S cue ????|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they are combined here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Best switch - means no @C ruff|pg||
nt|mcarroll: So game the limit but they may investigate slam, and hopefully stop at 5 which is safe|pg||
nt|april7: 2 keycards are missing, so EW will stay out of slam|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They have bid 7NT in Open|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Linda|pg||
nt|sybarra: wow!  lot to do here then |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another flat board I think|pg||
nt|ybob: maybe regular KCA|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah - W has no trump to return when in with @CA so the ruff is still available|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting that neither N or S could dbl the artificial @d bids|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s lead looks more like a favorite except for the lack of entries to N hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  old adage of leading a 4 card suit when 5-4 against NT hold true here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cherdano:  declarer has to be a bit careful here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D lead difficult|pg||
nt|petergill: Good lead by Andy Hung, better than say @DK|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North realizes South has heart shortage so the hands fit badly|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But I think we all have played worse contract than 4@h on this board....|pg||
nt|jaapfr: as a kib says: just go with the book|pg||
nt|imp_jan: wonder why north did not bid 1@S, not that it matters much|pg||
nt|imp_jan: these semi finals are played over 2 x 14 brds|pg||
nt|andyv:  8@s would at least tell pd your suit isn't that good|pg||
nt|imp_jan: tomorrow the final will played over 3 x 16 brds|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: 4th highes from longest suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: often works|pg||
nt|april7: 6@S makes on a non @D lead|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kiwibridge: 6@D is confusing|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another swing|pg||
nt|garnetts: harder to find a @D lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be a good pick up for e|pg||
nt|andyv:  Egypt|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@D+1@H+1@C+1@S=5, 2@D as it is will make|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I can tell you all the bids here,  but we might be headed in the same direction |pg||
nt|lml: it looks like North is in charge of this auction though|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess not that hard:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: mazybe not |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there would have been seperate events if enought entries it says|pg||
nt|lml: its harder to visualize 7 from the north hand if that is true|pg||
pc|cT|nt|haans: all cards wrong for declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: except @HJ10|pg||
nt|april7: and also 6@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: look at bidding in OR,  that looks like a strong 2 @D opening |pg||
pc|c2|nt|rgdruru: Incredible since they stay in 6|pg||
nt|mcarroll: true|pg||
nt|andyv:  now 8 tricks within reach if W can read @c situation|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mcarroll: @CQ good technique again, makes W think about whether Pd has !K|pg||
nt|lml: but North will invite 7 I suspect and south will go of course|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Which makes it easier - and leaves S in control|pg||
nt|lml: what North may not know is how solid South's diamonds are|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry I typed to fast its  multi with the strong option |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: south is holding 7nt bid|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|sharynr: the Dutch women (Girls?) have taken the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: played 8 of spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: and now he is sad:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: have a lot of sympathy---the 6@D bid shows character and understanding |pg||
nt|garnetts: Should get the clubs right after this |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Strange defense Likely to end play himself|pg||
nt|santyclz: Quite.  Doesn't quite do it for declarer though.|pg||
nt|haans: they have to go back home and have a little talk|pg||
nt|andyv:  back to 7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|sybarra: N bid 2 nt expecting a wk major,  but was pleasantly surprised |pg||
pc|sK|nt|jaapfr: is usa using 1@D opening as 10-15 with 2+@D?|pg||
nt|lml: this is one of the easier grands to reach|pg||
nt|lml: I like grand claimers|pg||
nt|lml: I dont want to have to work too hard in 7|pg||
nt|sybarra: me either |pg||
nt|sybarra: opening lead and claim |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @H @H without thinking she must be very tired|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rnmalik: 8 tricks only|pg||
nt|petergill: but the contract figures to fail, after this good lead and good defence, I think|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like -2 here also|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cherdano:  now EW can get a trump promotion|pg||
nt|cherdano:  with @SK and three rounds of diamond|pg||
nt|chick: yeah, that's what I figured... too bad :(|pg||
nt|andyv:  and diminishing|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk5: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=12  for standings after 12 rounds. Top 8 after this round advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: tomorrow|pg||
nt|cindy:  what time is it there ?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|haans: spade 8 was a little to much|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: how to get them right?|pg||
nt|andyv:  W may have played this a bit too fast|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kiwibridge: 10 imps again|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I love these short matches lots of swings great stuff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: an indictment on the wbf really|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 19:22|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|ybob: but if 4@S was normaly KCA its a wrong bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Wrong tempo for 10 tricks now|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cherdano:  but the @D pitch prevents that|pg||
pc|dT|nt|haans: still down|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|petergill: @H to 9 was the winning play if you can see all 52 cards, as we can|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like 3 more imps to N/S|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: do or die stuff-one swing to win the match:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the most logic play after @DK was @CK|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kiwibridge: wrong!|pg||
nt|garnetts: A@C and Club to the Q then finesse|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|haans: just about|pg||
nt|haans: why did W never polay @D?|pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, with the other hand dummy, an innocent enough @HJ switch by the Argentinian East allowed the contract to make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: rather dull boards until now hope it changes soon|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|nt|kiwibridge: well that solved it|pg||
nt|haans: was close|pg||
nt|petergill: West deduced perhaps that there was no rush to play @D's|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzus: need to return a club after @d 10 to get promotion|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|haans: played clubs  late|pg||

nt|andyv:  and 5 more imps for Egypt|pg||
nt|tweety1: EW finds the slam and becomes the new leader :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  a chance for E/W as slam seems reasonable|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so usa red have clawed back the deficit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For 10 tricks the @h finess must be done early|pg||
nt|jaapfr: who plays 1nt here?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok cindy where does this end:)?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: How did he lose 3 tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: spade ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: and you know this is a push agst. a good team |pg||
nt|lml: you do but it feels good to get there anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: you bet! |pg||
nt|lml: I never mark +1520 as a minus position :)|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|cherdano:  yes locking declarer in dummy would have worked too to beat it legitimately|pg||
nt|haans: and N|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 43 imps in 7 boards|pg||
nt|garnetts: Very poor auction in the OR--East failing to bid 4@H |pg||
nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  East should exit with a high club to do that!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: same contract only -3 OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  esp. when W made a slam try with 4@c bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: usually better to pass initially then act--initial action being a little weaker in good style|pg||
nt|andyv:  some players hate to pass:)|pg||
nt|chick: of course if the boards had been in reverse order, we'd say that NED clawed back their deficit :)|pg||
nt|cindy:  2@h|pg||
nt|don paulus: 2 nt ?n now|pg||
nt|cindy:  nah|pg||
nt|rnmalik: action board:)|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|cherdano:  (in case declarer has @C6)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: exactly|pg||
nt|haans: also weak openings|pg||
nt|sharynr: and so is North apparently :)|pg||
nt|haans: what an overcall|pg||
nt|2celik1: in 6|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cze salim welcome|pg||
nt|rnmalik: corrected:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: There we go.  That's more like what we expect from jr's.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H NS and some play|pg||
nt|andyv:  they like to play machismo bridge:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: may get too high here in n/s |pg||
nt|lml: do you like opening 1@H |pg||
nt|lml: I know 6-5 come alive but still|pg||
nt|sybarra: IF opening I might start with 1 @S   |pg||
nt|lml: I suspect east-west is going to play this hand anyway|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Not for me. I prefer a weak 2 but not with those @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: thats the problem Martin |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: better than most other bids she made|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: hard to predict pass pass board in this table|pg||
nt|2celik1: hi Gary thank you|pg||
nt|garnetts: No reason for South to even think|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well that is a certainly brave from North--well done|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice bid by N|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1C-1@H-1@S-1nt?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this time i do not believe you:)|pg||
nt|cindy:  i dont really like bidding 2N on that hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: I guess I would sit back and hope to get in on second round |pg||
mb|1N!|an|GF|nt|cherdano:  West is tempted to double for takout?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he is thinking|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i would double too|pg||
nt|garnetts: even I might make this one|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well passed S guess hes seen pards weak 2's before:)|pg||
nt|petergill: Team 42 is a good team, from four different countries (Bulgaria from Eastern Europe, Belgium from Western Europe, South Africa and Australia), pehaps the most geographically ...|pg||
nt|petergill: diverse team ever in the history of bridge|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah yes - see what happens when I go to pour coffee|pg||
nt|april7: only a partscore in @S|pg||
nt|lml: me too|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree with Shirley - the least worst bi is 1 @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  if he had doubled, EW could get to 4@H|pg||
nt|sharynr: very true, operator|pg||
nt|don paulus: diff with @c lead|pg||
nt|don paulus: 3 nt|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lots of excitement here :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: again NOT an opener, who teaches these kids?|pg||
nt|lml: well he got both suits in|pg||
nt|mcarroll: bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: of course that may be at the 4 level coming back to me |pg||
nt|lml: I agree with that too but I would rather not open|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard sometimes takes me (seriously) for a real opening bid |pg||
mb|2C!|nt|2celik1: so young so much|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this ones is cold|pg||
nt|haans: 15+ for big clubs|pg||
nt|tweety1: puff|pg||
nt|garnetts: which is why West does better to pass intially and then bid--you really do need a system after a multi|pg||
nt|andyv:  if W had his bid, I'd much prefer a dbl by E at this vul than 4@S bid|pg||
nt|don paulus: well ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  which would probably make|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he passed|pg||
nt|haans: first unusual bid|pg||
nt|don paulus: thought 8 pts was in the max range|pg||
nt|don paulus: what scared him off ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: and south is about to bid 3nt with good spots|pg||
nt|haans: clubs lead?|pg||
mb|2D!|an|18-20 balanced|nt|cherdano:  North has an easy pass of 2@C|pg||
nt|haans: pass on 2@D are S serious|pg||
nt|haans: that is something to talk about|pg||
nt|don paulus: if not - switch will follow|pg||
nt|garnetts: Just as an aside--the recommended lead is the A@D |pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, it is tough on BBO when you are playing strong players and things don't go your way|pg||
nt|sybarra: werent you ever young Gary, and felt invicible?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: W pls pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzus: again 5-1 trumps|pg||
nt|sharynr: South is happy |pg||
nt|haans: no double = no so happy|pg||
nt|sharynr: i predict down 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: need @c T swtch to beat|pg||
nt|haans: clubs T?|pg||
nt|haans: all are going down|pg||
nt|chick: the juniors are fearless :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: let me think...yes I was young once but learnt sound priciples via Charles goren|pg||
nt|sybarra: hey, the wose that happens is you go down....|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @d10 is a nice lead - or?|pg||
nt|chick: 99.9% of the bridge world :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
nt|cindy:  W has no choice|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jaapfr: @DT or @D4 no big difference|pg||
nt|cindy:  N has no choice|pg||
nt|sybarra: S being fearless  |pg||
nt|lml: I don't much like redouble by Verbeek... he would have been better placed to have bid his clubs|pg||
nt|lml: still 3NT is a good spot for east-west|pg||
nt|sybarra: 9 tricks off the top |pg||
nt|lml: if they bid the club slam I think they are more likely to drop the stiff king here|pg||
nt|lml: one of the specs told me they have no way to force with a club bid so redouble was his only choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  3NT should be defeated I think as the defence can set up clubs before declarer can establish a second diamond|pg||
nt|cindy:  i meant 3@h :-)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: E neither|pg||
nt|sybarra: guessing stiff K of clubs is beaucoup tricks  |pg||
nt|lml: he will on his way to taking his nine tricks|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rnmalik: small a winner here|pg||
nt|sybarra: aha|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 3 better you are saying |pg||
nt|haans: its tough on BBS if you do not have the cards|pg||
nt|haans: BBO|pg||
nt|sybarra: (per a jr.)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: -1|pg||
nt|mcarroll: EW have done well to push NS to the 3 level but it should make|pg||
nt|mcarroll: provioded of course that everyone passes|pg||
nt|boedhy: very strange things the Japanese youngsters in the other room are doing |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Safety play of @CA in 3NT gets all the marbles|pg||
nt|lml: if he doesnt duck the opening lead and there really is no reason to he will take all the tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: in other table marion made a great lead against slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 3 losers only|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: at least we have youth playing which is a great thing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Es lead was a @d but not the 10|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cherdano:  so NS will score an easy +130|pg||
nt|iris100:  3@S should go down as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  where as double would have gotten EW to a making @H partial, or game|pg||
nt|cherdano:  it doesn't usually pay to let opponents play 2@C when you are 5-5 in the unbid suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: played k|pg||
nt|haans: not easy to find|pg||
nt|chick: actually, I don't mind the E opener, honors are top and texture is better than the previous hand we discussed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hey i'm getting great feedback kibitzers @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Cornelia |pg||
nt|andyv:  as one spec points out, we've all been in far worse slams... and some of them even made!|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|haans: i assume 1H did show 5 spades|pg||
nt|don paulus: probably transfer|pg||
nt|ybob: 1NT ask how many controls ?|pg||
nt|haans: yes mb|pg||
nt|ybob: not alert ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: 2 h was transfer |pg||
nt|haans: ty|pg||
nt|garnetts: Surely not with three trumps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'll leap wildly with shape or support for pard|pg||
nt|andyv:  S not giving up yet|pg||
nt|andyv:  possibly unaware of how much ground they have made up this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|2celik1: and we are in Istanbul on of the excited city on the earth |pg||
nt|don paulus: - 2 ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: do not see how to make now|pg||
mb|4D|nt|petergill: or at least that is how I felt in the Spingold on BBO the other day being crushed (pleasantly, I have to admit) by Alan Sontag|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: E says sorry partner if i am wrong with double bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzus: this is real|pg||
nt|boedhy: they bid well to find the save against the game on the last board but that made the Italians bid the slam and they lead the @d still making........|pg||
nt|boedhy: sorry the Polish youngsters|pg||
nt|Gerben42: you can make up just as much by not bidding slam as by bidding slam, depending on if it makes or not|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|haans: smal clubs = grave error|pg||
nt|andyv:  now time to give up the ghost|pg||
mb|5D|nt|don paulus: S asking @c|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or can she seduce S to hit @HA:)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  EW had no idea how distributional South is|pg||
nt|andyv:  now the danger zone|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@D sounds like the end|pg||
nt|Gerben42: from the looks of it|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure...S seems pretty determined|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  If South just passed a forcing bid she chose an excellent time to do so|pg||
nt|andyv:  tough problem for N|pg||
nt|imp_jan: last stop...|pg||
nt|andyv:  he appears to have signed off twice but S keeps on bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: michal seems confused|pg||
nt|Gerben42: south bidding a lot for a limited hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: and passed!!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@D showed 18-20|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  6@d will have one chance...@c lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Cannot ruff both hands make it difficult for him|pg||
nt|andyv:  because of 3 trump... with 4, 4@S is automatic, with 3, 800 or 1100 are very real possibilities|pg||
nt|garnetts: WEst should not really have the mountain he has--and 200 or 500 are much more likely|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm afraid that 2Aces and an unsupported K is only 2 quick tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: means you can provide just 2 of the 7 tricks you are bidding for, part needs to provide 3 times as many as you|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: again director is called|pg||
nt|chick: but of course partner can also promote some of your other stuff to full tricks, too |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: east says ý thought adam has spade stoper|pg||
nt|jaapfr: so usa red first 3 imps|pg||
nt|andyv:  wow... great stop|pg||
nt|andyv:  i play 5N as pick a slam so, to have read that as a stop was very well done.|pg||
nt|andyv:  somehow I don't think this auction is in their portfolio:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: so many questions in both sides|pg||
nt|Gerben42: on all 4 sides no doubt|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ybob: .|pg||
nt|haans: from specs 1@H 8-11 any 2@H trf|pg||
nt|imp_jan: so we have a very close match indeed, brd 30 is the last one, therefore both teams much in contention|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ybob: 3Nt was cold|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  As before, an extra trick can eventually be established in diamonds but not hearts|pg||
nt|boedhy: no need to play the @dd let it make |pg||
nt|april7: @D lead was not the best idea, now S makes the contract, otherwise 1 down|pg||
nt|april7: ruffing out the 10 of @D|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk5: Since USA Blue can't be caught, they get 1st choice to choose their opponents in the quarter-finals among teams finishing 5-8|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i dont really blame them for giving up this trick|pg||
pc|dK|nt|april7: should play @D from dummy and not from hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|nigel_k:  Playing on hearts looks like it will limit declarer to eight tricks|pg||
nt|iris100:  itrue|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Also note the excellent choice of a trump as North was marked with short trumps and the ability to ruff clubs|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  For the opening lead|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mcarroll: Neede @H switch to defeat this|pg||
nt|mcarroll: needed|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: great experience for these youngsters, there are 3 Kiwis there|pg||
nt|iris100:  very nice opening lead|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|jaapfr: good defense and good declarer play and good bidding (still a dull board:)lol|pg||
nt|ralfwil: watch up now, If E returns a @c  or a @s!|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: W will have not choice at the end of the day but to play ace of @C |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: made any black suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: oefff|pg||
pc|cT|nt|petergill: @HA might run away if not cashed now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E must cash @hA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|2celik1: we have second flat board in this match (hopefully)|pg||
nt|sybarra: why not spade?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sharynr: At this point NS should know only @D left in East hand|pg||
nt|2celik1: why not 4?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: OR has slowed doen|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I mentioned yesterday also that Pakistan team participating in this champioship and all the players below 18.|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: east played king to small dia from dummy|pg||
nt|2celik1: wow|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now even down 2 by very fine defense N|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|sybarra: going going gone|pg||
nt|andyv:  11 tricks off top... guess @hs for 12 although W will be squeezed|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: he is going to enjoy this trick|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: I am sure he is smiling |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: all table is smiling including me:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)  |pg||
nt|sybarra: tell then we are also |pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|cindy:  what was the hurry to play spades ?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jaapfr: he knewq where @CA was!|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|cherdano:  at the other table, North bid 2@S over 2@C|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|haans: endplay|pg||
nt|sharynr: !J would have been better there|pg||
nt|sharynr: @DJ|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|pc|s5|pg||

mb|1C|nt|marlowepi: even so, S only has 10 tricks, and must discard twice from hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|athene: no, the club lead gave her 11|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|marlowepi: oh, i thought you meant even without the club lead|pg||

nt|cherdano:  but here North was so weak (no points in partner's suits) that he shouldn't mind playing 2@C|pg||
nt|haans: a double of 2@D would tell N = i have @D|pg||
nt|sharynr: agree|pg||
nt|sharynr: especially since the 1NT bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: another grand|pg||
nt|haans: slam here|pg||
nt|don paulus: 7 @h or nt even|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C-3@D easy |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: our 4th player is from Ecuador|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: by?|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is because a blind lead often gives away a crucial trick--so cash and ace to get a look|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: fair enough|pg||
nt|petergill: Flat board - in my opinion, a little overtrick ns not a big deal at imps|pg||
nt|petergill: Team 42 want 11 more imps to reach the magical 42 imp mark|pg||
nt|iris100:  another flat board|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: players are talking about 3@s board|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: france guys think 2down|pg||
nt|iris100:  1 SA by S in the open room|pg||
nt|sybarra: something truly didnt make sense there |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 75% of the time, all those openers do is tell declarer how to finesse|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or a senior moment:)?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the potential @C cruff by S|pg||
nt|april7: Q of @D was known in W hand though|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he played king of diamonds from hand|pg||
nt|april7: which was wrong|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Thinking - hmm 7NT twice in a row - and of course will find the play in 7 lol|pg||
mb|1C!|an|+2|nt|2celik1: i see |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but only at imps|pg||
nt|sybarra: 42 imp= blitz |pg||
nt|andyv:  take away the K@c and 800 is still there|pg||
nt|jaapfr: defense was fine until E forgot to get 2 aces for -1|pg||
nt|cindy:  you mean 7 clubs in north hand ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: or else much harder|pg||
nt|garnetts: more so at pairs I think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N best here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: nah S trew  away:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT for EW top 9|pg||
nt|imp_jan: so nl is leading with the smallest of margins, but anything can happen |pg||
mb|1N!|an|GF relay|nt|kiwibridge: not sure how that happened :)|pg||
nt|2celik1: so many new Zia's coming|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hope so:)|pg||
nt|petergill: yes, and it is their team name, from the Douglas Adams stories|pg||
nt|don paulus: will bid 4 @h ?|pg||
nt|ybob: probably 4@H -2 here|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is certainly not my favo Neg. X |pg||
nt|sybarra: only 6 pts and junk!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not my favourite vul overcall either :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: i guess she was expecting spades in N 's hand.but they all are ok now|pg||
nt|sybarra: true|pg||
nt|chick: 4 hearts and 7-8 points,  AQ very likely 2 full tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/VGData/minirama.html  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Andy finding the spades and minor bid "amuzing" |pg||
nt|mcarroll: But @h overcall may make it difficult to bid|pg||
nt|Gerben42: just one free throw|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe same lead rule should apply to 5N as to 6N... make the most non-commital lead possible|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|haans: 3 controls (A=2 K=1)|pg||

nt|don paulus: hi marshall|pg||
nt|haans: hi Marshall|pg||

nt|2celik1: i will take care on Kiwis by tomorrow Gary|pg||
nt|haans: having 14 hcp 3 have already bid?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: on 3rd and 4@D|pg||
nt|don paulus: 4 @s now|pg||
nt|cindy:  S is marked with a doubleton @c|pg||
nt|cindy:  would have led a singleton @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: 1 think I admire about young players is there very quick decisions|pg||
nt|haans: you came to a GRAND|pg||
nt|don paulus: we saved a grand for you :)|pg||
nt|haans: good opps bidding|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is a lot of spades to bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: Also some practiced pairs reverse their normal lead structure against pre-empts--K from AK and the lead of an ace requires an attitude signal|pg||
nt|sybarra: does he X?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he is thinking|pg||

nt|haans: does W let is stand|pg||
nt|andyv:  and you are right...either pass, or dbl and then bid @s would have been better action by W|pg||
nt|lml: the opening 2@S bid tends to push north-south|pg||
nt|andyv:  just make sure your name isn't Shaq|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|vugraphzus: and passed|pg||
nt|iris100:  same bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @H forcing?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure he wants to give the hand away |pg||
nt|petergill: Operator, are you sure that East di not dbl?|pg||
nt|tweety1: very unlucky slam miss other room again..|pg||
mb|2H|nt|cherdano:  declarer will probably take this trick, cross to a diamond, and take a spade finesse|pg||
nt|garnetts: This argument is a little futile--I will always support when I can rather than double in this situation--and with a small manipulation there is a grand for EW|pg||
nt|jaapfr: were trown away in meantime on 3rd and 4th @D Cindy|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: or "bettering" the contract, same level |pg||
nt|marlowepi: in a sense the N hand does not merit an upgrade, but with both minor tenaces to protect 2N is acceptable. the high card structure of the N hand is esepecially good for suit play, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and if S has a major N wants to be declarer|pg||
nt|lml: the problem here is communcations|pg||
mb|3N|nt|santyclz: Discussion hand.  In your partnership does the 2@h bid imply @d support or tend to show @d shortage?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I wouldnt  with E east hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes|pg||
nt|haans: if he pass W cannot bid anymore|pg||
nt|chick: 2@C will be limit raise |pg||
nt|boedhy: will make 8 or 9 tricks also|pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: keeps ops out of 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: i think east should ask rkcb with 4nt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure that 4S did anything to keep them out of 7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: man overboard here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Is west getting desperate ?  4@H ?  |pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Basar|pg||
nt|haans: call it tactical|pg||
nt|ybob: 1NT 2@C 2@H 4@H ?|pg||
nt|chick: which S declines to bid, given his hand full of garbage :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Rdbl = I have a H stop perhaps?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very interesting sequence of bidding|pg||
nt|rnmalik: that shows control|pg||
nt|april7: if E plays on @S 4th @D can't be cashed by S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: another overbid|pg||
nt|haans: but are not W to fault pass on 1@C makeable|pg||
nt|sharynr: was 1@C not forcing?|pg||
nt|haans: maybe all bid are forcing|pg||
nt|sharynr: seems both bids alerted|pg||
nt|haans: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: west always puts cards over board when he is dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: indeed discussion |pg||
nt|haans: are opener bidding all forcing bids|pg||
nt|garnetts: But as you say I am sure we would have managed a little better in practice|pg||
nt|garnetts: Interesting choice 2@S--anyone for what I think is an obvious 2@D |pg||
nt|lml: West made a good lead|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes good safe lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: needs to know what this 2 @c alert means..|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: probably could be short|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: they didnt wrote note|pg||
nt|garnetts: To some extent yes--but given limited possibilities 2@D seems to be space saving|pg||
nt|andyv:  Neth. Red need a couple of calm boards |pg||
pc|d5|nt|petergill: @HJ - that's good news and bad news, thinks South - the good news is that I'm not doubled|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cherdano:  giving him 8 tricks|pg||
nt|sharynr: is west the only male at the table?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: eventually:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Difficult to bid, easy to play|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very right|pg||
pc|d7|nt|don paulus: 3 nt makes with @d lead :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: write|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Is W thinking?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|andyv:  perhaps N was trying to show value of his hand with 2@s bid|pg||
nt|mcarroll: if so got it right|pg||
nt|rnmalik: was|pg||
nt|Gerben42: this calm enough?|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't hurt|pg||
pc|c3|nt|iris100:  looks like 3@S, 1@D, 2@H and 1@C = just made|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Winning the spade doesn't help as dummy has no entry|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Declarer now has to guess spades though East's opening bid will help|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kiwibridge: excellent J@C|pg||
nt|garnetts: Great card by South|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H first natural bid by opener|pg||
nt|haans: even Big Clubs are changing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and -1 I think!|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: opening 1m could lead to a wrong-sided major suit game |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|tweety1: then 2 @s is not that strong|pg||
pc|c2|nt|april7: S should duck twice|pg||
pc|cT|nt|haans: will not like were clubs honor are|pg||
nt|sharynr: she pretty much needs the @CA onside to make, and @D 3-3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnmalik: The system they are playing. If 2@D natural then 2@H natural too|pg||
nt|sybarra: since not match points,  why bother with jxx of @D |pg||
nt|garnetts: Well he hasn't got reversing vales with a void in what is liekly to be partner's suit|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Did you meet Masood Salim, his Partner. Walking computer|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we've lost some comparisons in that break|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: i will put in scores shortly|pg||
nt|garnetts: maximum hurt here now n|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|nt|kiwibridge: I was scoring at the far eastern in Auckland 1976, Zia in black velvet and much gold chains|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NS on the ball and well rewarded|pg||
nt|garnetts: Self inflicted wound though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Not any longer!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kiwibridge: a magnet for the ladies :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: losing finesse |pg||
nt|rnmalik: swing as it is|pg||
nt|sybarra: adding to  NL lead here |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  @hQ now appears to be with West so East needs the @sQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: now she is thinking|pg||
nt|andyv:  it's a reverse, @c void being the negative part|pg||
nt|don paulus: insist on @h and down|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|april7: 9 tricks now also|pg||
nt|april7: sorry, I don't kow, ask the vuegraph|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: what a finesse |pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: what was 2S? 3 controls?|pg||
nt|haans: i do not belive 4nt was an option for E|pg||
nt|iris100:  right!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: one should  know to count to 9 to make|pg||
nt|sybarra: should be a push |pg||
nt|lml: I think there might be a squeeze now|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzus: west seems upset after looking at dummy|pg||
nt|haans: i do belibve that 3 controls|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, can't really comment without knowing what 2@cs was all about.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|c5|nt|don paulus: do not like singelton trump lead - but other leads may give a trick away|pg||
nt|andyv:  otherwise, 2@d seems like the normal bid|pg||
nt|lml: well not now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|haans: many play 1@H to be semi-relay natural or stronger|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W made a common error at trick one. from KJ(T) the lowest honor is the correct card when suit is led against a suit contract|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lml: if South wins it I think he might have a double squeeze|pg||
nt|lml: with clubs as the central suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: club was led in the other room |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s8|nt|cherdano:  well declarer had other ideas|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh yes but important to extract the max damage|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not a great save against a likely NS partscore|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cherdano:  but he will always get 8 tricks on this layout|pg||
nt|jaapfr: give a @C and home|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: doing good|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|petergill: Ducking @S6 to the ten was correct play - when trump control is an issue, North's @SA must be retained at all costs for as long as possible in order to retain some control of the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: hand|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|tweety1: 2@C=GF, 2@S=5/4 with good opening not reverse    i have been told.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: There will be a swinh here as N is in 3@H dbl in Open|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mcarroll: swing!|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sharynr: now has to guess what to keep|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzus: fingerin dia k|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably... italy was playing well and usa wasn't when i watched the first half|pg||
mc|11|nt|petergill: I see - the other table is in 5@SX|pg||
pg||
qx|o25|st||md|3SQ97HQ643DJ942CJ3,SK862HJ75DAT73C52,SAT543HA9D8CA9874,SJHKT82DKQ65CKQT6|sv|e|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@S alertable, presumably, because 2@H would show a fine, upstanding, solid 2@S bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: this hand is a poster child for methods that give you multiple ways to show a single raise of a major over double|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: but i dont see why N would then voluntarily bid 3, since her suit is spades|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: you might easily buy it at 2S|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bid 3S--or compete some other way--if need be, but not before|pg||
nt|athene: the only time it's right to bid 3 right away voluntarily is if passing allows them to get in and then bid on successfully over 3@S|pg||
nt|athene: that's a pretty small risk...not worth all the times you go 3@S-1 when 2@S was buying it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that isnt very likely, and if they do you have 3 aces |pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and they are re|pg||
nt|marlowepi: red|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: one thing you notice - if anyone ever takes an advance sacrifice position in the bidding, on the basis that his partner has showed a very weak hand and opponents "must" have ...|pg||
nt|athene: something on, it's usually wrong|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: even very weak hands just turn up with the odd defensive trick which means opps weren't making whatever it was you were scared of|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: or two tricks|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c7|pg||

nt|vugraphzus: after 4nt he can ask extras with 5nt .and he will get @d K for grand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then W should bid 5N as a grand slam try over 5H. not practical to play it specifically as Josephine by 2C opener|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we are playing 10 boards here.|pg||
nt|petergill: so this is a good board for New Zealand (NS)|pg||
nt|haans: natural to bid 4@H going down|pg||
nt|iris100:  next board looks more interesting|pg||
nt|iris100:  4@H by W has some chances|pg||
nt|iris100:  nasty lead for N|pg||
nt|tweety1: then the only reason seems the quality of @s   to be bid.|pg||
nt|tweety1: instead of @d|pg||
nt|garnetts: Odd method--also some case for South responding with 1@S |pg||
nt|andyv:  ty... makes more sense now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good effort both rooms|pg||
nt|marlowepi: playing the ten from KJT allows W to find out who has the queen|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, private|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 6 brds left in this exciting match|pg||
nt|Gerben42: italy by 23 at the moment|pg||
mb|2H!|an|6-10 6 s or 9-14 5s 5m or 5s 5m GF|nt|vugraphzus: and threw it|pg||
nt|sharynr: :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Really, e ducked the @s?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: A great opportunity for the girls to take the lead|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|cherdano:  EW should get to 4@H here|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt it |pg||
nt|rnmalik: CR @S lead and no@D finesse 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: @C lead |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6@S looks a go|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sorry - missed the continuation, contract in Open 5@D by EW|pg||
nt|lml: my partner hates it when I open the north hand but I dont mind it at all at this vul|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@S t/o of @S|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 2@S is t.a.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk5: In the other room East wanted to protect his @HK and pulled 6@S to 6NT. That was not a good idea|pg||
nt|Walddk5: @DK put an end to that contract|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But your are right Jaap, that declarer is -1 if W has @ca OR @sK, so it´s safe to cash @hA ane exit with a @c|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 6@H on fo NS|pg||
nt|mcarroll: for|pg||
nt|andyv:  possible swing here|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: so the score soon will be 31-12 or 31-8 I think|pg||
nt|garnetts: Looks like a push here in 4@H plus one |pg||
nt|chick: N has another bid, I think|pg||
nt|don paulus: very close match - was only 2 pts difference between the teams|pg||
mb|4S|nt|haans: 3@C best bid|pg||
nt|sharynr: agree|pg||
nt|haans: do not understand what 4@S mean?|pg||
nt|petergill: Anticipating 4@H by EW, Norh takes the advance save with a keen eye on the vulnerability|pg||
nt|don paulus: surprising result on board 16 : 6 @s X !|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, N bid 5@d here|pg||
nt|chick: it was still a good thing to consider, even though it didn't work out this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: should not expect a @S fit |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks Basar, hard for you when we lose connection|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no swings here then|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: its ok |pg||
nt|rnmalik: short and sweet-no trouble for us.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Operator, please check the result on bd 28.  It looked to be -1.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes pl|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt coming up some how |pg||
nt|haans: in teori thay have 3nt EW|pg||
nt|don paulus: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=12|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: you can play 5nt as Q ask|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we appreciate your efforts :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: u welcome:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: does W sit?|pg||
nt|haans: do you agree with that peter?|pg||
nt|petergill: His mother makes the same sorts of pressure bids when she plays with me - putting max pressure on EW early in the bidding, giving EW the last guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am not sure W can sit |pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H is cold for 620|pg||
nt|haans: go back on hand. DID YOU p X THEN?|pg||
nt|chick: 4 may be a little brave though :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S DBL was not bad but 5@C. 4NT for minors|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Everything right for EW in 6@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: west is in tank again|pg||
nt|mcarroll: difficult to see how it could be bid however|pg||
nt|imp_jan: probably a club lead now|pg||
mb|d|nt|santyclz: Not that it makes much of an imp difference.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S looks likt transfer to clubs |pg||
nt|petergill: West might take the Dbl as values instead of pure penalty|pg||
nt|petergill: as he has done!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: imo NS here played a more accurate match these first 8 boards|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult as it looks to bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  did 2@h promise 6@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 2@C = any game force?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good old gazillie|pg||
nt|don paulus: - 6 = 1400 wins an imp :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i was taught by my wife to say first Sorry and then later to investigate whether i was rite or wrong:(|pg||
nt|chick: S's 2@H bid can be made on 3 hearts and 13 cards|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Nice principle Jaap!|pg||
nt|chick: I think I like your wife already :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S obviously has seen pd's weak openings|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think the vulernability can give you good excuse |pg||
nt|lml: I might have done more with the south hand if only to ward off 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  and meanwhile 5 IMPS to Italy, as North found a more successful @H lead at the other table|pg||
nt|haans: can anyone tell all scores|pg||
nt|iris100:  1@H, 3@C and a spade, thats it for N|pg||
nt|andyv:  less pressure at 4@h on declarer|pg||
nt|garnetts: They were pushed to 5@H next door|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They bid and made it in Open!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and why not?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: she did not jump|pg||
nt|sharynr: Once again, a touch too high|pg||
nt|petergill: A good coup by Luke Gardiner, making EW guess, and they have now guessed wrongly|pg||
nt|jaapfr: until b8 i said: now they go overboard:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  if not, S|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's raise very risky on only 3@ss|pg||
nt|Gerben42: what did 2@H show exactly?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: molenaar might have dbld since 3@S might have been a preemptive raise|pg||
nt|andyv:  doesn't look like N took it as a preemptive raise|pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans: but no jumping from E :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: too bad, 3nt would have been better|pg||
nt|don paulus: good action by S|pg||
nt|haans: all i can say is HOLY ...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Still, -200 is better than -620|pg||
nt|rnmalik: wow|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well noth thought apparently he had enough extra's|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: maybe. 2H going down. in my view it is better and safer to act initially on the S hand|pg||
nt|haans: me 2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: even in this sequence-looking for @S check I think|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 13 imps|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Indeed Rashed|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kiwibridge: looks like Noname have a decent win here barring a disaster on 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: S not wanting N to bid again!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Not easy in the play|pg||
nt|rnmalik: play very important. I thought it was a marked small @H lead|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: passed 3nt |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: strange|pg||
nt|sybarra: that lead doesnt hurt |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: this is quite fun table|pg||
nt|garnetts: will cash AK @H then clubs for 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cherdano:  2N 18-19 balalnced, 3@D transfer, 3@S superaccept i assume|pg||
nt|garnetts: slam needs both major suits to break 3-2 with an extra residual chance in spades and the club ace right or led |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: and some more greek speech |pg||
nt|sybarra: that could be right also |pg||
nt|iris100:  but you wont make 4!E from E|pg||
nt|jaapfr: to be honest me too:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but which leaddddddddddddddd?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: @CK and not queen?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  cash K@h, clear clubs and exit @h|pg||
nt|garnetts: mmaybe not with the unblock|pg||
nt|jaapfr: oh bad luck|pg||
nt|don paulus: didnot both deny @d control ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you call that luck|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This sequence may get them there|pg||
nt|lml: looking at that dummy I would try another club|pg||
nt|lml: its the only real chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: esp  holding k of @D |pg||
nt|mcarroll: The tricky lead of @D8 is not going to work either|pg||
nt|lml: I admit it is a slim chance :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|cherdano:  after @CAK and seeing the heart break, declarer can endplay South|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: seems that way.i couldnt read notes|pg||
nt|iris100:  4@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: screamed for D lead in my view|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|cherdano:  so he won't need the @D finesse|pg||
nt|sharynr: yes, kib suggests a trump back to let declarer do all the owrk|pg||
pc|h5|nt|iris100:  as N doesnt follow 3 rounds of @D|pg||
nt|lml: he wanted to make sure parnter would ruff high|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yyy|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petergill: The vulnerability was vital to North's decision to bounce the auction. He knew EW have 8+ @H's if South has only 4 spades. |pg||
nt|chick: hehehe|pg||
nt|murat e: can make plus one though same lead in open room|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sharynr: work*|pg||
nt|don paulus: would you then prefer 2 @c over dbl ? with only 3 @s ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably not going to mess around much here |pg||
nt|imp_jan: dynamic defense|pg||
nt|andyv:  very much so|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes he played K|pg||
nt|imp_jan: diamond cont makes decl trumpshort|pg||
pc|h2|nt|april7: probably @H lead, because ace of @S makes no sense|pg||
pc|h4|nt|don paulus: very close match apart from board 11|pg||
nt|don paulus: sry 12|pg||
nt|april7: wrong side, sorry|pg||
pc|h7|nt|nigel_k:  Yes, slightly lucky escape for E/W then|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|nigel_k:  Possibly their defence to 1NT left West with no option other than pass|pg||
nt|chick: yep, a big swing back for NED, although some kibs saying it is a gift, not earned|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ralfwil: Wrong to play @hK! only the @h9!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: must lead a diamond even with a void on that auction|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|petergill: Good comeback by New Zealand - they got 800 (the max) for 12 imps on the last board|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  Many pairs now play double as artificial. If West's only alternative was 2NT for minors, pass is more understandable|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||

mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|cindy:  not likely to get doubled if you bid it immediately|pg||
nt|cindy:  and you are in trouble|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or ever. the problem is that it risks turning a plus into a minus, and for no really good reason|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|cindy:  with 3 cards in the red suits, odds are they can make 3@h or 3@d|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wouldnt be worried about them doubling 3S whether now or on next round|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p!|an|not discussed but alerted from both side|nt|marlowepi: true, but they have to bid it first, and the opartner of the doubler has already passed, and they are red and they have very few aces, so they might easily pass it out in 2S even ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when they can make something|pg||
nt|cindy:  this round ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: and if they do go on i can still compete, and they arent going to double a nonvul partial without any aces|pg||

nt|sybarra: and last bd now  |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to Basar our wonderful operator,  great job ! |pg||
nt|haans: 50 minutes to next match|pg||
nt|petergill: Credit that 9 imp gain to Luke Gardiner's daring but sensible tactical bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: thx all last board now.i hope you are enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The defence dropped a trick so 3 imps to N/S|pg||
nt|tweety1: maybe some imps exchanges here:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think the auction next door was dreadful|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to imagine how E/W got to that lovely contract in the OR|pg||
nt|tweety1: Many people opens 1 @c instead of @d with W's hand nowadays... and the only disadvantage is...|pg||
nt|andyv:  even so, I'd pass 1H like a shot with the E hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: Their method needs looking at--personally I do mind the 1@C on a doubleton--but dislike the 1@h rebid--but if you must then also must bid 2@D after 2@C |pg||
nt|tweety1: agree  1nt seems better than 1 h|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, W opened 1@c, which was alerted as 2+... and E showed a preference for @cs|pg||
nt|chick: not totally sure I agree ... E in the other room made a decision to protect his @HK and got unlucky|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is last bd of this set |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: laura is saying " maybe i should bid 5 spades"|pg||

nt|sybarra: thx also to Peter and Hans my co commentators. great fun guys! |pg||
nt|ybob: lucky 6@D here|pg||
nt|chick: an imp gain.  USA will be hardpressed to make back 20 imps in one hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: this is the last board of this match.thx all for watching|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@C fine result|pg||
nt|jaapfr: why inspired normal play also ok:)|pg||
nt|don paulus: tx basar - we havenot noticed you - so great job :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Delete that - mixing the teams up again|pg||
nt|Gerben42: another good result for Netherlands, 300 vs a partscore|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: long way to go|pg||
nt|murat e: it was commented that seven clubs on w a major suit squeeze on south|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wait i was wrong no entry to hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: multi again |pg||
mb|1C!|nt|cherdano:  NS can make grand slam|pg||
nt|cherdano:  in several strains|pg||
nt|cherdano:  but 6@C is the best contract|pg||
nt|sharynr: A multi opening|pg||
nt|garnetts: well after this |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I guess it's lunch time Basar?|pg||
nt|haans: ty :))|pg||
nt|rgdruru: and 6@s|pg||
nt|don paulus: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Information.htm|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well W had already said in the other room that he wanted to play 6S, ie E had no reason to think the heart king needed protection|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Basar as always....great job! |pg||
nt|chick: but it closes the IMP gap, keeping this session exciting :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry, meant as private|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as N had JUMPED to 2@H, there was a fair chance the !A was there, ergo 6NT was an awful bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty also Cornelia and Gary, for your thoughts and insights on these hands |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: last board now.thx all.i hope you enjoyed the show.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzus: last bord was just made.fixed it now|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes its:)|pg||
mb|1D!|an|!H|nt|cherdano:  is 3S general strength, or does it show clubs?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: welcome back:)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well Japan_Czech will enjoy theirs :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: yuck --not a great spot |pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to the WBF for organizing and bringing this to bbo   we LOVE seening the jrs. ! |pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, thanks Basar and thanks to the organisers in Istanbul such as Murat Molva and Ata Aydin.  |pg||
nt|chick: it's been done, but they will have to set 6@CXX about 8 tricks|pg||
nt|lml: not my choice on this hand  with 4 @S but thats me|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree with you Linda  (maybe just old fashioned me) |pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  slam will be difficult to find now|pg||
nt|garnetts: but curiously the spades mean it will play OK|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: i agree |pg||
nt|rnmalik: action board again|pg||
nt|murat e: so the most critical board of the match....|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx Basar indeed great|pg||
mb|1H!|an|3!H|nt|haans: not available|pg||
nt|iris100:  possible 3SA on the last one|pg||
nt|iris100:  but i think it goes down on a @S lead and @C switch on the third trick|pg||
nt|andyv:  E won't get too excited|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sharynr: zig and zag|pg||
nt|santyclz: Awfully heavy for a weak jump, maybe intermediate?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx specs for your informative and funny comments, we love them |pg||
mb|2H|nt|don paulus: re-hi|pg||
nt|haans: hi|pg||
nt|petergill: A low heart lead????|pg||
nt|haans: lead low @H = make|pg||
nt|petergill: More daring bidding by NS gives Andy Hung a lead problem|pg||
nt|haans: u first|pg||
nt|petergill: the textbooks say 4th best from this holding|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7@C and 7NT do make in practise but how to bid it:)/|pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: surprising result board 27 !|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: first blood of this match|pg||
nt|don paulus: y|pg||
nt|sybarra: might even have trouble making 4 |pg||
nt|rnmalik: that should be the contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: ak of clubs, ruff, and ace of hts |pg||
nt|rnmalik: less damage|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: ty guys|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 12 imps for that great slam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: last board of this segment|pg||
nt|lml: they are playing it from the right side though |pg||
nt|sybarra: almost surprised we are not playing 3 nt here |pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  A nasty guess in diamonds awaits declarer as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: this is last board of the round thx everyone|pg||
nt|iris100:  but then, you just give up a @D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With @hK and J  on Sthere is also 13 tricks in nt|pg||
nt|chick: especially with N chiming in with a bid|pg||
nt|murat e: now a lightner double beats the grand because east will be on play|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1@S1@H2@D4@C will do|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no I think these are 14's Rashed|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think we play 14 in the Quarter finals?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes 14 boards|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree, but life is not perfect so I would probably compromise my principles and open a multi|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|cherdano:  meanwhile, 3@S would have been down 5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a fun match, next round starts in 45 minutes, thanks Basar great operating and thanks Rashed and Salim|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|petergill: Luke Gardiner did well to make himself declarer - now can he get the clubs right?|pg||
nt|haans: 10-12 nt win lots because opps not know what to bid|pg||
nt|rgdruru: i guess 6 @D i pretty hard to reach, especially after nt opening|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks kibs, best session so far for feedback|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is some serious handhogging by W. lucky that D K is on|pg||
nt|andyv:  showing @ds and longer @cs|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so Macura will try 3@D|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rgdruru: not that it should be bid|pg||
nt|haans: nore logical that NT-bidder have @DK|pg||
nt|haans: as logical as @CA|pg||
nt|rgdruru: even so, both 3nt and 6 @D are down if k @D on W|pg||
nt|haans: yep so better slam has been missed|pg||
nt|ybob: S made that opening works|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: game|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx Basar another great job, Shirley and Cornelia nice to join you again, cheers|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now 7@C down played by N and we order a @H lead:)|pg||
nt|lml: one thing about this hand is your are very likely to be able to enter the auction later with your fine heart suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Gary no swings in borad 10, so Noname comfortable winners:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: EW lead low = like I think, attitude leads versus NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: wow!   ed |pg||
nt|sybarra: wd |pg||
nt|haans: not better that max 50%|pg||
nt|jaapfr: played by E|pg||
nt|murat e: passssssss|pg||
nt|andyv:  good discipline on part of E/W|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jaapfr: can not play @DA so must play @DQ and cah her 9 tricks|pg||
nt|lml: playing it from the west hand is going to get the Netherland Red an imp|pg||
nt|Gerben42: why bid 3-over-3 on a known 5-3 fit?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|santyclz: The open room reached 5@c on bd 29 on what looks very much like a bidding misunderstanding.|pg||
nt|sybarra: optimist!|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rnmalik: @CA|pg||
nt|sybarra: that maybe should have opening lead |pg||
nt|mcarroll: This can make|pg||
nt|april7: there was an accident in OR in 3NT in this hand, wrong card pulled probably!?|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|haans: its been a good mstch|pg||
nt|haans: match|pg||
nt|chick: wow, this may be close to 20 imps after all|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7@C pls|pg||
nt|imp_jan: fredin dbl by south|pg||
nt|ralfwil: return to 6nt!!!!|pg||
nt|murat e: wow|pg||
nt|imp_jan: return to 7n|pg||
nt|chick: silly double though, never double a contract you can beat unless you can also double and beat anywhere they run to|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but 7nt best XX C:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: fast passes after double.they didnt even think about 7cl or 6nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: south says "wow" for dummy|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharynr: opps had to get @C started to defeat a game|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes a good win, have fun later I see you are on with Shirley she is good fun|pg||
nt|haans: time to claim|pg||
nt|chick: they'll pay for it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb they want beer?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The Noname team has a good goalkeeper ....|pg||
nt|jaapfr: cash|pg||
nt|sybarra: for those asking,  the 3 @S bid was like puppet stayman,   shows the 6 card suit is the other majors |pg||
pc|dA|nt|cherdano:  and maybe double by North would have actually been the best bid|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, 1-1 clubs was indicated by EW's silence in the bidding - with a club void, West might have bid over 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: this is the last board of the match.thx all see you tomorrow|pg||
pc|d8|nt|haans: must ruff a @H|pg||
nt|iris100:  now itÂ´s 12 tricks|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|cherdano:  if partner passes it is great|pg||

nt|marlowepi: yes, there is no arguing that queen of D is the right play at trick one|pg||
nt|don paulus: 5 @c - 2 @h|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 9 or 10 tricks = 5 imps to Neth.|pg||

mb|1N|nt|athene: well, 2@S only advertises weakness if it can't ever be a decent hand|pg||
nt|athene: many people play them very wide-ranging when partner has passed|pg||
nt|cindy:  true   might be a pretty good hand once partner has passed|pg||
nt|athene: as terence reese said "a pre-empt which is known to be weak is a blunt sword"|pg||

mb|d!|an|points|nt|vugraphzut: dbl:points|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no it advertises wekaness regardless. but the 2S might not BE weak. the point is they are sure enough going to ASSUME you are weak so it is a waste of time or worse when you ARE ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: weak|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: 3@H lebensohl response showing values and now south wasn't ever stopping|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps on the hand in this room Drijver should have bid 4NT over 3NT since he knew his partner hadn't punted 3nt off a solid minor|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|nt|athene: i don't have a convention card for NS but this auction looks as though 2@C was weak diamonds or various strong|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D was pre-empt facing diamonds|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|athene: east can be trump squeezed in spades and diamonds to make 7@H here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in regard to your comment about the other hand, he knew S didnt have a solid minor but she wtill could have kad:   Kx   Ax   AKJTxxx  Jx    |pg||
nt|athene: true but then 4NT is making|pg||
nt|athene: ten tricks on top on a spade lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tru|pg||
nt|athene: 5nt was pick-a-slam|pg||
nt|athene: mainly offering hearts or notrumps|pg||
nt|athene: but there is a danger south might pass this|pg||
nt|vugraphzut: 5nt alerted as undiscussed|pg||
nt|cindy:  well  6@d isnt a good pick|pg||
nt|athene: putting her partner with @DAKQxxx for his "balanced" hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: a frequent result when players try to get too fancy|pg||
nt|athene: i don't like north's 6@D |pg||
nt|athene: he was catering to good diamonds with south|pg||
nt|athene: but |pg||
nt|athene: with a red two suiter|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: she would just bid 4@D transfer then 6@D|pg||
nt|athene: so my guess is, 6@D was saying "hmmm not sure about 4@D"|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|athene: in which case, discuss your methods more, guys :(|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|cindy:  or change them|pg||
nt|athene: i have played this two-way 2@C opener (strong or weak @D) and it can be fun|pg||
nt|cindy:  if S has to bid 3@d, i wouldnt like that much|pg||
nt|athene: but when responder pre-empts, it can really cause big headaches when opener has the good hand|pg||
nt|athene: you need a billion agreements|pg||
nt|cindy:  or even when your partner preempts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or dont have any:   2C 2D 2Nt 3D 3H 5N  (responder to 2C cant be in psoition to use GSF so pick a slam--6H or 6N)|pg||
nt|cindy:  partner is over there preempting when you are in grand slam range|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont make easy hands difficult|pg||
nt|athene: well, of course, when north has the good hand, it's way better NOT to be playing this |pg||
nt|athene: and NOT to pre-empt|pg||
nt|athene: but the argument is that you gain on all the hands when 2@C was a weak-2@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is my  1 mantra: dontmake easy hands hard|pg||
nt|athene: and you are prepared to put up with difficulties in these auctions|pg||
nt|cindy:  and shouldnt methods cater to big hands than preemptive hands ?|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||

nt|boedhy: 5 low is probably always down 4@s is close but very hard to reach|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: multi again |pg||
nt|sybarra: Marion in other room tried 3 @S |pg||
nt|lml: nothing wrong with this hand in third chair|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: No points - no fit stay out of the bidding if possible|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 23 vs 17|pg||
nt|boedhy: think this will end the auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @S might even be the better bid  |pg||
nt|sybarra: if opps getting in will be at the 4 level |pg||
mb|1N!|nt|imp_jan: 7 hearts on a diamond / spade squeeze|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C p 3@D, meant as transfer but understood as natural?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: bidding 4@s should not get that reward|pg||
mb|2H!|an|7-10 5 cards !H|nt|Gerben42: 6@H does not seem to go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: shouldnt make |pg||
nt|rogerclee: i think they play 2@C is weak with diamonds or strong bal|pg||
nt|rogerclee: so 3@D was preemptive, 3n said he was strong|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: and effectively the match|pg||
nt|lml: 3@S shouldn't make|pg||
nt|sybarra: that too |pg||
nt|lml: now well West defend?|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|jaapfr: no no:)|pg||
nt|lml: I believe that double suggests hearts although I am talking about what I play|pg||
nt|rogerclee: then it became a little unclear|pg||
nt|Gerben42: ah so then 4@D was misunderstood perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: If the defence get this right, declarer will not enjoy this hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Declare may enjoy it even less in Open as he was doubled in 3NT|pg||
nt|rogerclee: well he completed the transfer and then marion bid 5N to pick|pg||
nt|rogerclee: now i guess bob did not have confidence in the auction and bid 6d just in case marion had diamonds|pg||
nt|rogerclee: marion passed just in case bob had diamonds|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|lml: if East double in the direct chair it is takeout of hearts|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lml: so this double shows hearts|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This could be interesting|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: if i was marion i wld always correct to a heart contract|pg||
mb|4N|nt|rnmalik: 7 tricks max|pg||
nt|april7: @H lead would have been much better, but if N's suit is @S then @S is better|pg||
nt|boedhy: yep Probably Greece- Italy and Netherlands - Japan for the semi finals|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrxxx: that's why i personally reject playing certain openings as weak or strong|pg||
nt|Gerben42: hasn't got much to do with that, the misunderstanding was in 5NT|pg||
nt|mrxxx: it makes it harder to preempt, because opener can always be strong and there will be room for misunderstandings|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: director has called|pg||
mb|5H|nt|Walddk5: and USA, unofficially, won by 1 IMP against Greece!|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: So Italy, NL, USA and Japan/Czech in the semis|pg||
mb|5N!|nt|rnmalik: that too with @C finesse|pg||
nt|andyv:  17 imps riding on this|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|sybarra: at the end,  they will be glad pards have them "covered" at the other table |pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42: or 20|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: tým thýnks there ýs a tempo break wýth 4 @H býd|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrxxx: so after this board red will be 1 imp behind and all will depend on the last board :)|pg||
