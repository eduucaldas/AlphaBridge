nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|cherdano:  not so easy to bid|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well done all around there.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: a non vul 2 suiter |pg||
nt|haans: thats a new one|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: in NL  they call it Muiderberg |pg||
nt|cherdano:  still West can confirm keycards|pg||
nt|jcwla: 7 a push at 4@H making.  OR North opted to use Jacoby 2NT and South rebid 4@H.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|haans: with that weak hand?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think Verbeek is looking for some action here  |pg||
nt|bigtrain: normal precision it's easier...  E makes a @D positive then W can visualize grand|pg||
nt|cherdano:  confirm having all keycards, and sometimes East can just bid 7 on a spade or club trick source|pg||
nt|cherdano:  2@D showing a good heart raise|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some play that bidding 6 says a keycard is missing.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|sybarra: or maybe it is just a 5 card (very) wk 2 |pg||
nt|haans: 3@H better than normal with @H|pg||
nt|lml: now vulnerable and with a 6 card suit this time I bid lots|pg||
nt|cherdano:  and this time it would be successful, too|pg||
nt|lml: yes :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: This looks like Puppet.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|rnmalik: do you agree to such opening when P is not a passed hand|pg||
nt|cherdano:  so 2@D promised 3 hearts and 8+ points to be precise|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: wimpy pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: 'look for reasons to bid, not reasons not to bid'  D. Colbert|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: donmt as and we wont tell you|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cherdano:  what did this double show?|pg||
nt|haans: tricky to make|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S much better|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|haans: playing with weak hands trumf|pg||
nt|roswolf: easier to go off than to make i think|pg||
nt|haans: W did open weak "@S in OR|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|lml: remember that old joke about my nose runs and my feet smell|pg||
nt|cherdano:  East has a nice stopper and a 6-card suit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: if matt has similar agreements to his dad...  2@D shows exactly 3@H and about 6-9 dummy points|pg||
nt|jcwla: OR is also playing 3@S.|pg||
nt|cherdano:  North bid 3@S in the other room instead of 2@S|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|cherdano:  2@S doesnt look like enough to me either|pg||
nt|roswolf: playing to ruff a club should work|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|lml: he is upside down|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|haans: and now only on a @D finesse|pg||
nt|haans: even without dutch 4@S are easy to find|pg||
pc|h4|nt|haans: i call it dutch shotrre that M...|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|nt|cherdano:  and if the 6-card suit doesn't runn|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|haans: throw in also called nedplay possoble|pg||
nt|haans: endplay|pg||
nt|bigtrain: N does have alot of losers and knows his patrtner is somewhat limited|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|cherdano:  2NT might be down too|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bigtrain: personally i think 2@S is about right|pg||
nt|jcwla: Ditto.|pg||
nt|cherdano:  limited due to the opponents' bidding?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|nt|lml: beside it is a VUL game|pg||
nt|lml: you should bid it if it sniffs at you|pg||
nt|bigtrain: and more than half his values won't contribute to offense|pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: easy|pg||
nt|lml: the one he bid was a NV game|pg||
nt|cherdano:  but i think game will be good opposite many minimum takeout doubles with 4 spades|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cherdano:  @SATxx and AK in one minor - ok these are perfect cards maybe|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h8|nt|bigtrain: bidding game on hands like this will more likely lose 6 IMPs than win 10|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|jcwla: All of S's choices have worked out as poorly as possible.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 8 a push at 3@S making.|pg||
nt|haans: doing well here|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is unnecessarily slow|pg||
nt|haans: all you dutch all the world knows what Muiderberg is. But Dutch is shorter|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: she is still thinking|pg||
nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our very efficient nameless operator. Great Job! Finally, our appreciation to the WBF and TBF for ensuring that this wonderful ...|pg||

pc|c7|pc|h2|pc|c4|pc|s8|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c9|pc|d4|nt|cherdano:  if partner raises - i would be happy to be in game i think|pg||
nt|cherdano:  if he passes - i would go back to 2@S please :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: think how much better the game would be if the @HAJ was in a minor...  then he's worth 3@S|pg||
nt|jcwla: Exactly.|pg||

nt|haans: trust no spade lead|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|cherdano:  now this time East is taking the aggressive route!|pg||
nt|lml: it is allowed in unlimited events at major tournaments if there are at least 6 boards per round|pg||

pc|sA|nt|rnmalik: even then but no @C finesse|pg||

nt|haans: smirny say 'its cold sp on D' na dright that is|pg||
nt|cherdano:  3@D shows spades, probably with a maximum|pg||

nt|cherdano:  HedyG tells me usually in france, 3@D shows a minimum with spades|pg||
nt|cherdano:  if so, East would have been extremely aggressive|pg||
nt|lml: I play the same way|pg||
nt|lml: 3!M shows a good hand with that M|pg||
nt|cherdano:  note the @HT here, in case declarer has @HA9x|pg||
