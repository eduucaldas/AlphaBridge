mb|3H|nt|davidstern: Possible endplay in hearts on fourth club on East|pg||

nt|davidstern: Win second diamond two trumps and play a club twoards the jack|pg||
mb|4C|nt|davidstern: Birman obviously likes his hand and the @DK|pg||
nt|gracelin: if East cashed his club winners earlier|pg||
nt|ady: should lose  2 clubs and a diamond  and a heart|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It has been confirmed that Alon Birman did play @HQ, covered, and later squeezed East in hearts and clubs on board 17. Well deserved 8 IMPs|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ady: 2 red aces off   |pg||
nt|davidstern: 5@H isnt a bad save here|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|4H|nt|davidstern: Interestingly in the CR South never took a bid|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: if they can find the 2 club ruffs   4@S can go down|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|davidstern: If they bid 5@S and South leads the @H3 will North get the gag|pg||
nt|gracelin: North probably will|pg||
mb|5S|nt|gracelin: even 2 round of H, I don't see declarer making 5S|pg||
nt|ady: if e/w play 5 spades and a top spade is played from west hand   south should play the 9 |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|nt|gracelin: unless he plays double dummy, running C10 after drawing all trumps|pg||
nt|ady: yes   5@S    looks too high  whatever|pg||
nt|davidstern: Unimaginative lead if I may say so|pg||
nt|ady: will have to play very well to make|pg||
nt|davidstern: If North wins ace and tries two hearts declarer will make - |pg||
nt|davidstern: He will play @CK first and use @DK for second club finesse|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gracelin: true|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A player who bids 5@S does not have two hearts|pg||

pc|s2|pc|d6|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|davidstern: I have a suspicion that not winning the @DA has beaten this contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: By the way, was that not a mandatory @S9 falsecard David had?|pg||
nt|ady: still cant make|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer still needs to run C10 on first club play to make this., it's double dummy|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes the @S9 gives declarer losing spade options|pg||
nt|ady: I would have thought so|pg||
nt|davidstern: And UNlikely but not impossible - he knows South has 4-x-3-x|pg||
nt|gracelin: but his double of 5S more or less exposed his trump length|pg||
nt|davidstern: Agree but the @S9 is the 'right' card|pg||
nt|gracelin: agree|pg||
nt|davidstern: I dont know the strength of East but I wouldn't rule out making this here|pg||
nt|ady: how does he proceed ?|pg||
nt|davidstern: He knows East has no points in spades or diamonds so may assume 6 hearts|pg||
nt|davidstern: he proceeds by playing @C10 first round|pg||
pc|s7|nt|gracelin: yes, maybe declarer can read south's distribution and find the double play of running C10|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|davidstern: And only loses to singleton jack in likelyhood anyway|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: still bet against|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|haans: in my book its forcing to at least a raise|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can make arguments for and against pass by South being forcing here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: having redoubled 1@H, and doubled 1@s for (presumably) penalties, you would certainly put money on pass being forcing|pg||
nt|othered1: You redouble, then make a penalty double, then want to let them play at the2-level undoubled?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me only one round forcing|pg||
nt|haans: many have no agreement at all|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 17 indeed mysterious Mike|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: I agree on pass of 2@D forcing only this round.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: but if South is merely saying "I have 10-11 hcp with good spades", then NS might have no fit and be prepared to defend undoubled  |pg||
pc|d5|pc|s5|pg||
nt|othered1: may have to do with your standards for an opening 1-bid.|pg||
nt|haans: then he cannt pass with 12-13 hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one of those things where partnership discussion and agreement is needed  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: When N only can bid 2@h it´s easy for S to pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in my major partnerships, pass of 2@D would be forcing, and deny a penalty double of 2@D  |pg||
nt|othered1: sounds about right|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes - after trick 3, the squeeze against East was on|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: what squeeze|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North can throw one losing diamond on the @HA, but what can he do with the other one? |pg||
nt|mdgraham: heart-club|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||

nt|mdgraham: many pairs now play transfers after 1M-dbl |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: so here they would simply bid 1@S as South|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Maybe Alon will balance with 2NT now|pg||
nt|davidstern: In fact I would be shocked if he didnt|pg||
nt|davidstern: If that happens and East bids 3@S then West may act again|pg||
nt|gracelin: Seems west in closed room suddenly remembered they are still more than 80 behind and decided to be aggressive.|pg||
nt|ady: whatever  n/s will lose ground here|pg||

mb|3C|nt|gracelin: if south hadn't overcalled 1H, he has an easy double of 2S to find their club fit.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|haans: error|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|marlowepi: in a way W has a somewhat promising hand, but the heart holding is very bad on the auction, once N has not raised hearts despite being marked with some values|pg||

nt|cindy:  too high already|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|haans: corrected|pg||

nt|cindy:  think both sides overbid|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||

nt|cindy:  lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E had a hard hand to evaluate, but if W can invite when E holds those trumps it is understandable that E would not want to bid 3S, esp. since his 2S could probably have been on 3 ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: cards. still, 4C seems like a lot to bid. a simple 4S would be a reasonable middle ground|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|haans: 6@D???|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has better than minimum Losing Trick Count for an opener, playability in 3 suits including both majors, and adequate defense. that adds up to an opener by my lights. also it is ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not a hand on which it rates to be easy to enter later. unless it goes 1C-2C (or PPP1C), you will likely be frozen out|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: that is the way with bididng systems. If they work, people will play them. If they don't they die out |pg||
nt|cindy:  they will never find their @d fit|pg||

mb|d|nt|haans: many systems are to hard to learn they die as you change partner|pg||
mb|r|nt|cindy:  now some action !|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I feel a system advertisement coming on|pg||
nt|ralfwil: That´s a sequence I don´t like|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: yikes! |pg||
nt|mdgraham: East trying to smoke them into 4@S?|pg||
nt|cindy:  E had too much coffee|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: lots play protective 1NT as 12-14|pg||
nt|haans: he has spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but NS are an experienced pair - once they double for penalty, they don't run just because there is a redouble |pg||
nt|marlowepi: in that sense conventions differ radically from systems. terrible conventions--such as Gambling 3NT and Muiderberg--don't die out|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|haans: wider at 1M opening |pg||

nt|mdgraham: not that one hand proves anything, of course.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|h7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that 1S overcall does not look like the action of an experienced pair, unless in the sense of Jimi Hendrix' "Are You Experienced?"|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: overcalling 1S on the N hand is astonishing. not just because of the short bad suit but because of the great defense to hearts. what is to stop pd from taking an advance phantom ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: save against a no-play 4H?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: ruff a spade (6), lead a club..what does North do? West accepts ruffs and plays diamonds towards dummy |pg||

nt|marlowepi: he might have lef it even without the king|pg||
nt|marlowepi: holding 2 trump tricks and an ace|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with a partner who bid. less likely, but not impossible|pg||
nt|mdgraham: would North double on @SA and @HQJ10x? West might suspect hearts 5-0|pg||
nt|haans: i think he is thinking that :)|pg||
nt|haans: 5-0|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont accept that argument, because N couldnt expect to cash more than one spade anyway so spade king is not an extra asset for the double|pg||

nt|Walddk2: They are on 31 in the other room, the slam hand, easily bid by E-W here in the beginning|pg||
nt|ady: communications bad|pg||
nt|gracelin: They could hear our talking.  Zak led a diamond when Andy said Diamond best :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@S on 31 in the CR. No swing|pg||
nt|ady: win in hand  and low club?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A fine set for Birman; they need one more like this when we resume with the last 16 boards today|pg||
