nt|ady: start of with a routine 4@H for e/w|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Oh, dear, that is much worse!|pg||
mb|3C|nt|cuttysark: Slam bidding is important - the play even moer so - and both deserve a little extra care|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West has been conservative here - if he had overbid a littel they might reach game, which makes on this lead|pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes Liz - atleast an invitational 2NT|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Well, the 'making' part is a little double dummy!|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: 11 tricks in @h but I think EW should have tried 4@s|pg||

nt|ritong: defense can t do anything if declarer tackles @ss in a natural way|pg||
nt|kit: seems like with East having king of spades and clubs 3-2, declarer will always have 5 clubs, 2 spades, 2 hearts, 3 diamonds = 12|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh -- count to 12 tricks Al|pg||
nt|ritong: now, if he envisages @s H9x with west, that s an other story|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: nearest stairway do not use the elevators" The players have decided not to leave because we're only on the 2nd floor so if there's really a problem we'll be able to get out ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: quickly. But the announcement is a little irritating so Granovetter has had trouble thinking|pg||
nt|harmon: Eke left a butt burning probably|pg||
nt|ritong: if he assumes contract to be identical other room, this @s handling, ie looking for W with H9x(x) of @ss could be the best way to swing the hand|pg||
nt|mrace: lol Harmon |pg||
nt|ahollan1: without alarm -- what lead do you make?   passive trump or   ???|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Ekeblad left the room to smoke during the fire alarm - now Granovetter tells Cohen he can defend - "that'll be a first"|pg||

nt|chick: hmmm, someone who doesn't believe in claiming|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Was wondering how they went down in the other room: heart lead to ace and return ruffed|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: all that is needed for slam is an Ace or King in @C|pg||
nt|chick: 4@H limit for NS,  4@S for EW|pg||
nt|haans: 5@H for NS|pg||
mb|3S|nt|chick: maybe 3@S if the defense gets the diamonds exactly correct |pg||

pc|c3|nt|raghavan: 3 losers|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: might just bash out trumps here   not finesse|pg||

nt|andyv:  almost impossible to misplay the @h suit|pg||
nt|haans: but he has to finesse|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|cuttysark: Indeed - but it is hard for East to realise that North has only one spade, so he has allowed him into dummy|pg||

nt|ady: 5@C   hapens to make   but if KQJ10XXX heats and A@D was opposite would not be good|pg||
mb|2N|nt|cuttysark: Not keen on this overcall: since 1@D consumes no spade it should show either a good suit or a good hand...|pg||
nt|layzi: wow|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuttysark: He must think he has a good hand :)|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: this looks makeable|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: and why not playing low on the lead?|pg||
