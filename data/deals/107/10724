nt|rv: Indian team which won BFAME and 1 Bermuda Bowl QFs, Formidables have not qualified for the QFs in this tourney for the fifth successive year|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Other Results: texas -10 against Ajay Vaish, Manyavar -39 against Sree Cement, Promila saraf -5 against Sree Radhye|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|rv: it looks like Kiran Nadar's (Capt of Formidables and wife of Shiv Nadar whose company HCL sponsors the tourney) own tourney is jinxed for her:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: Thanks Buddy for the updates, well in this room, keep a close watch on South - I am sure, you will see some spectacular bids and defenses moving on|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: not warranted DS|pg||
nt|gulyas: I guess NS did not play support doubles in the other room, so they missed their superior fit (@Ss), and went down in 3@D|pg||
nt|rv: Aloke Sadhu generally wears Size 16 Bidding shoes:)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dslee: Well possibilities are high, incidentally I was talking to him for a while in the venue, he says that his style has changed :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: wow, I guess he lent a pair to his pd too:)|pg||
nt|AHalim: but it is not down yet|pg||
nt|rv: I might have bid 2@h with North's hand instead of 3@d|pg||
nt|gulyas: or passed|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: 2 minutes |pg||
nt|dslee: Yes, I was in the venue, the ending for the qualifications were grand, keeping an avg of 17.2 dint qualify this time|pg||
nt|rv: the 3rd team which lost in the finals of the Team trials, Texan Aces topped the league, but trailing in the QFs by 10 IMPs|pg||
nt|dslee: usual 16.8/9 does qualify, this time it was tough|pg||
nt|rv: Formidables were handicapped by the absence of Sunit Chokshi who couldn't make it at the last minute because his dad is hospitalised|pg||
nt|rv: both DSM and Formidables required less than 20 VPs in the last 2 rounds, but couldn't get them|pg||
nt|AHalim: are we going to crash ?|pg||
nt|rv: this tourney is wide open now, Texan Aces and Sree Cement are probably the favorites now, but I don't rule out more upsets|pg||
nt|gulyas: thats bad news|pg||
nt|dslee: In the last round, DSM vs SHREE CEMENTS, the score was 16-14 against the former, well , had it been 17-13 for DSM, they were in|pg||
