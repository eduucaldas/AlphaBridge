nt|guthi: A routine 3NT for NS here.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all finesses working :)|pg||
nt|guthi: ah, now we'll never know what happened :) Doesnt matter for the score, so, np.|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: west claimed in last 4 card position..hoping decl was out of trumps..director called|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: now back...director ruled 1 down|pg||
nt|guthi: seems they are all edgy, playing such a close match. |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: So 12 to Texan Aces.|pg||
nt|guthi: Thanks for the info Mahesh.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|dslee: I am sure South had a happy beginning in the open room :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|dslee: Pass ?|pg||
nt|guthi: wonder what their 1NT opening range is, for NS. |pg||
nt|vugraphzau: 15-16|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 12/13 to 15 I guess|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|guthi: North choose to pass with the 12 count, interesting.|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|mandala r: he has 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: 4 @h 3 @s rest must come from @c and/or @d|pg||
nt|don paulus: depends on lead|pg||
mb|4H|nt|guthi: I guess 15-16, its popular in India to play this range.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx operator|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: rather limited I would suggest 15-18 far superior as is 12-15|pg||
nt|guthi: Team Mango is from the west of India (Mumbai/Bombay) where precision systems are 'standard' :) |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: CCWei would be turning|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: I am sure Key choosen to lead a @H over a @D because of the NT bid from Tiwari mostly denying major, but @D lead would had restricted in this deal|pg||
nt|sartaj1: 2NT was probably invitational; Tewary's hand with its nice club suit texture and length warrants a gameforce in my opinion|pg||
nt|guthi: you bet!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the trouble is there is no standard :)|pg||
nt|guthi: I play 14-16 when playing precision with my partner. it raises eyebrows everywhere here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mandala r: yes|pg||
nt|guthi: 3@S should be help suit. better than directly bidding 4.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|guthi: Open room is faster, they are on board 36 already (they have already played 46-48)|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|bobholl: this probably is weak with high colours|pg||
nt|sartaj1: There are some who still play 2@D as showing 10-11 with a diamond fit. Their idea is to ensure getting to the marginal game when partner has a balanced 14 count|pg||

nt|kista: but very unlikely to be reached|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kista: A stretched 2NT opening may have taken them there|pg||
nt|panja: it is either or at this point...|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kista: It is still tempting ...with a 7 card solid suit|pg||

nt|lml: I would lead the @SA into this type of auction without any thought|pg||

nt|vugraphzat:   and sadhu is fiddling with A@S|pg||

nt|panja: that is why I was thinking of 6N..better to keep Aloke out of the game|pg||

mb|1C|nt|guthi: this irresistible slam.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|sartaj1: Pass, Double or 2@C|pg||

mb|p|nt|don paulus: 2 ih NS|pg||

mb|1N|nt|dslee: 2@C|pg||

nt|guthi: They should be parking in 3@D|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: wrongsided|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and 2@D should be a transfer|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: not alerted 2@d|pg||

mb|3C|nt|dslee: bang, thats it|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: north saying natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: what is the lead @H :)? or @C:)?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: excellent, so another "variation" from standard :)|pg||
nt|guthi: hard to find people not playing transfers thesedays :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|don paulus: probably +1|pg||
nt|jcwla: So it's 6 to Sree Cement for bidding and making the NT game on 5 - with an overtrick no less.|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: director call by ian|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all sits well makeing 3, not many swing boards this set...apart from an amusing board 30 coming up soon|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: feels the "natural 2@D should be alerted as NOT a trandfer!"|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|guthi: Another forcing/non forcing 2H. |pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzau: n/s playing precision|pg||
nt|guthi: that explains the auction. |pg||
nt|guthi: even playing std, the opening would be 1@D. So it was evident.|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: south thinking|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|guthi: lack of complicated slam bidding gadgets make it difficult to bid this.|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: north denied @s cue|pg||
nt|guthi: but precision of CCWei offers good many gadets to check for controls., that would mean South should check controls in all the three suits. |pg||
pc|sA|nt|sartaj1: It was crucial to switch to hearts in time, else the diamonds provide enough discards; well done|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|kista: well 3N ia a  more practical bid...which he would have bid say with a @d suit instead of @s|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|panja: but you have to find the best of the approximate describers|pg||
nt|lml: I think 3NT is by the far the best choice|pg||
nt|panja: dbl or 3N are the two reasonable options, 3@S is clearly an error|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|c7|pg||
mc|9|nt|kista: the other table seems to be a bit  slow|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 3 minute break|pg||
nt|lml: I prefer 3NT would such good clubs|pg||
nt|kista:  Buddy why is board 40 left out ?|pg||
nt|lml: and I am not sure what to do over 4@H|pg||
nt|panja: the trouble with 3@S is how partner will see it when he does not have Spades....|pg||
nt|lml: but they might wind up with a minus if they bid 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: its live .|pg||
nt|panja: for 4 Clubs, North thought S would have 0 or 1, so had to have some Spade support...|pg||
nt|panja: South would have no way of knowing that....|pg||
nt|panja: contrast this with say a 2@C overcall over 1@S opening.....|pg||
nt|lml: be back in a minute|pg||
nt|panja: for that the overcaller could have quite a strong hand...|pg||
nt|panja: but there would be some bidding to follow before the auction ends, so some opportunity to clarify matters..|pg||
nt|panja: but out here..N had to take a shot..and 3Nt was the best shot, despite him not having @H check.|pg||
nt|panja: presumably, South would have bid 5@D and all would have been well after 3Nt overcall....|pg||
nt|kista: Unless again Alok smells out the @hA lead|pg||
nt|panja: of course, the positive score that 3@S led to is a plus associated with 3@S overcall.....|pg||
nt|lml: South should bid 5@D after an overcall|pg||
nt|lml: of 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: maybe not if they had a slow auction|pg||
nt|kista: OK Thx all...Buddy,Linda,panja ...have to be going|pg||

nt|sartaj1: hmm....maybe is better than my "mainstream" comment :)|pg||
