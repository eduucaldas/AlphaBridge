nt|vugraphzuj: hi|pg||
nt|ady: start of with a routine 4@H for e/w|pg||
nt|ady: south might pre-empt 3@C|pg||

mb|d!|mb|2C|mb|2H|nt|cuttysark: Oh, dear, that is much worse!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|cuttysark: Slam bidding is important - the play even moer so - and both deserve a little extra care|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West has been conservative here - if he had overbid a littel they might reach game, which makes on this lead|pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes Liz - atleast an invitational 2NT|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Well, the 'making' part is a little double dummy!|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|ralfwil: 11 tricks in @h but I think EW should have tried 4@s|pg||

nt|ahollan1: oh -- count to 12 tricks Al|pg||
nt|ritong: now, if he envisages @s H9x with west, that s an other story|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: nearest stairway do not use the elevators" The players have decided not to leave because we're only on the 2nd floor so if there's really a problem we'll be able to get out ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: quickly. But the announcement is a little irritating so Granovetter has had trouble thinking|pg||
nt|harmon: Eke left a butt burning probably|pg||
nt|ritong: if he assumes contract to be identical other room, this @s handling, ie looking for W with H9x(x) of @ss could be the best way to swing the hand|pg||
nt|mrace: lol Harmon |pg||
nt|ahollan1: without alarm -- what lead do you make?   passive trump or   ???|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I think so, and 3@D must show minimum spades|pg||

nt|andyv:  almost impossible to misplay the @h suit|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||

nt|lml: it seems normal enough at this vul|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes for me! |pg||
nt|ralfwil: But if defence slips in 3@s there are 10 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  i'm ok with 3@h bid...7 card suits headed by AK need to be heard from|pg||

pc|c8|pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|andyv:  S with 2 tricks and Jx of @h, k@s behind the doubler, should know that 4@h is not going for a big number|pg||
nt|lml: if South had bid 4@H over the double I wonder what would have happened?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me it´s better to lead @cJ from N, depending on the bidding|pg||
nt|andyv:  and he wants a @c lead on this auction|pg||
nt|lml: I like the idea of bidding 4@C over the double.  It makes a lot of sense|pg||

nt|ady: 5@C   hapens to make   but if KQJ10XXX heats and A@D was opposite would not be good|pg||
