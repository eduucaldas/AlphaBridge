mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: 6@H would make on a good day I suppose, but this is not the day|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|nicksan: 6 @H seems to be where you want to be, but the bad break in hearts make it very difficult...|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3@H looks like an encouraging bid to me, 4@H would be fast arrival|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even if hearts were 3-2, you would not want to be there on a club lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c cuebid confirms that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, one can understand Fohrer-Levin in the other room. They need to create swings|pg||
nt|hedyg: down 3 seems steep though|pg||
nt|nicksan: Club lead not devastating, still OK if hearts are 3-2 and spades 4-2...|pg||
mb|5N|nt|hedyg: "Josephine"|pg||
nt|nicksan: 5 NT Pick a slam?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: lets see|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 5NT is used as pick a slam more than a grand slam try nowadays|pg||
nt|nicksan: You're probably right, Hedy. Hearts have been set as trumps... |pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@C= i have 1 top honor|pg||
mb|7H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: Zack sees A@C in W ( they only make 1st round controls?) and W's @c losers going on his @ss, counts no @H losers..|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: still very optimistic|pg||
nt|nicksan: Losing "ruffing finesse" in diamonds and a force in clubs...this will not be pretty!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: David is not going to lead @DA. Zack is not a beginner, so they would not bid a grand slam unless he is void in diamonds|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|nicksan: Oh!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Extremely lucky that this will not cost Herbst a fortune|pg||
nt|nicksan: Bad start to a grand, don't you think?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: close to slam but too many soft values|pg||
nt|ady: nice easy 3NT for n/s to start     can make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cards :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Morning all|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: that is, S has too much soft stuff after 2N|pg||
nt|ady: might get to 6NT  going down|pg||
nt|sybarra: how about 6 @C?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nobody would make 12|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4NT by S and pass by N?|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C  is the best spot    if clubs 3-2  just need simple diamond finesse|pg||
nt|panja: South does not really have a good hand for slam..|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this is not an easy hand in the bidding. if S bids 4N, N will like the chances of 6C|pg||
nt|sybarra: skip the 6 @C comment, you need eyes on the ceiling|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's what a take-out double should look like|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: perfect indeed and 3@H on EW|pg||
nt|haans: and bidding clubs to get opps to high|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: South can raise clubs, but does the 1@C opening show a real suit? |pg||
mb|2D|nt|hedyg: our operator is Genossar Itamar , shalom lecha!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some sort of raise to 4N?|pg||
nt|vugraphzuw: =]|pg||
nt|sybarra: or minors |pg||
nt|panja: 24 HCP missing in AK's...if N has 21 of them..some chance..if N has a J or a Q...2 key cards will be missing and slam is no better than 50%|pg||
nt|lml: hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: you just need a @S lead to the ace,  guess the stiff K of @D....and voila |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: as so oftenb happens, the 2N opening preempts the side who owns the hand, making delicate slam exploration extremely difficult|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: is this what Levin wanted with his pass?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is a very aggressive second double by East. Still, he is 65 imps down|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C a make|pg||
nt|haans: sort of ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West could easily have bid at his first opportunity - surely he cannot bid less than game now |pg||
nt|ady: 6@H  playable   but 4-1 split not good      |pg||
mb|3H|nt|hedyg: 4@s like quantitative 4NT|pg||
nt|ady: if you gesss the stiff K@D   you only need one spade trick|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is true also |pg||
nt|marlowepi: why would anyone do that?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but how to do that?|pg||
nt|panja: y Marshall, absolutely..|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning from los angeles|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: there is a verb to describe that, and it is not "guess"|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Ra'anana for the Israel Team Trials. 8 segments of 16 boards; this is the fifth and last today|pg||
nt|ady: hi Geoffrey|pg||
mb|3N|an|Qbid spade|nt|panja: 2Nt is what I would like to designate as 'offside opening', too far too soon|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  may well be starting with a swing here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@c shows 4 cards in @c|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with decent support for all of pards suits I would have tried 3@H initially|pg||
nt|haans: Birman taking a chance|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this has good chances if declarer can pick the spades and clubs - and I think he will|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi andy, linda, roland, specs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Itamar Ginossar. Welcome to you|pg||
nt|lml: its early for you.  A little later in Toronto|pg||
nt|vugraphzuw: ty|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: and to our commentators, Linda, Marshall, Bob and Andy|pg||
nt|ady: 3 hearts obviously forcing p|pg||
mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: shalom Mar Ginossar|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: OR  in 4NT I am told   so n/s  will ;ose a little here being in clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Both East's doubles were for take-out. A take-out double does not later metamorphose into a penalty double |pg||
nt|haans: levin could not bid 3@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Levin has converted, but q102 of clubs not a great holding|pg||
nt|vugraphzuw: shalom shalom|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Linda, Itamar, Bob and Marshall|pg||
nt|mcarroll: EW probably should blast to the slam they really need action if they are going to get back into the match|pg||
nt|roswolf: must be a 2/1 auction but e/w will do well to bid the slam which at the score they need to and of course make it|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: why not Haans seemed obvious|pg||
nt|lml: the diamond lead seemed a good start for the defense|pg||
nt|roswolf: we of like mind martin|pg||
mb|5C|nt|hedyg: 8x 16 boards to play|pg||
nt|roswolf: you type faster though!:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: immediate yes but 3@H now?|pg||
nt|ady: might well make 6@S  on ace of diamonds lead |pg||
nt|roswolf: the heart split is inconvenient|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: we start off with just the sort rip-roaring contract that a team trailing by 74 IMPs thirsts to see|pg||
mb|p|mb|r|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Personally, I would have bid as West. At 65 down, defending 3@Cx on the first board with only Q10x of trumps opposite known shortage fails to appeal |pg||
nt|mcarroll: and the @c lead will make it very difficult|pg||
nt|ady: is east considering a cu of 5@D?|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: yes pard has reopened in case it was a trap pass, so I guess he has made two mistakes :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  your type of swing hand, Marshall|pg||
nt|lml: still this isn't that easy a contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: no a few IMPs could be at stake it is true|pg||
nt|lml: South returned a high diamond suggesting a spade|pg||
nt|andyv:  Birman made up a few imps last set... they were down by more than 90 at one poing|pg||
nt|lml: but North isnt so sure about spades|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kiwibridge: he got spades right|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|andyv:  point|pg||
nt|roswolf: well if this makes we may a match but i think this will just be more imps away|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: overtrick now!|pg||
nt|haans: Birman need new discussion NOW|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The psychological effect of this result could be considerable|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: depressingly so|pg||
nt|roswolf: with open cards this can be made i think but without divine inspiration this should fail|pg||
nt|ady: trump will give it   or spade if east guesses the trumps - unlikely|pg||
nt|ady: dont think it possible to maked with club back|pg||
nt|ady: even guessing heart position|pg||
nt|roswolf: the queen of clubs is a useful entry to hand - the more i think of it he must play for spades 3-3 and then he might sniff out the trump position- this deserves some thought|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: just staying out of slam will make each NS hope for a swing. the slam is odds against single-dummy, but playable|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: i like "poing", andy. in french it means fist|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|roswolf: there is now a crossruff|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|h3|nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|lml: I can see 6 tricks now for declarer but where is the seventh|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also reminds me of a cartoon from my early childhood "Gerald McBoingBoing"|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|roswolf: 2 clubs 2 spades and 8 trumps|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: for both pairs: imagine how you would feel at score-up; youa re 65 down - board 1, team-mates say "minus 470"|pg||
nt|lml: I remember Gerald|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|mcarroll: This looks impossible now as declarer has to ruff in both hand so the 4-1 break means a trump loser no matter what|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s6|pg||
nt|lml: nice try by declarer but the defense stayed "en pointe"|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: now off|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: Created by Dr.Seuss, Gerald was a baby/child who spoke only in sound effects|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|lml: I know its more interesting at matchpoints but this type of hand is a really battle|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: this is a preemptive forcing 1NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont try it! usually pd bids game |pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Fred Gitelman's "Rule": do not pass at these colours no matter how weak you are|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|nicksan: Sound tactics from Barel, not to let the opponents have a free run...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Don't make it too easy on your opponents|pg||
nt|hedyg: his pd never bids game and gets doubled for 800 or 1100?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Part of the game|pg||
nt|nicksan: If North raises, South has enough to bid game...but from what I've seen so far - he may not.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If North believes Barel, partner can't have anything|pg||
nt|hedyg: he still has a huge hand!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But 6 losers|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: Zack playing with fire|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe David can bid again now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: His 3@C before vost 500, this may cost a vulnerable game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: double or 3@H?|pg||
nt|nicksan: I have to question N/S's attitude to this match. Do you want to lose pretty - or try to win?|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzux: A Director have been called to the table.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: because of the huddle by S?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|hedyg: surely N has another bid with that hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No-one can know for sure because they are playing with screens|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: South and West are on the same side of the screen|pg||
nt|vugraphzux: the director was called by Zack|pg||

mb|1C|nt|sybarra: may well hear 4 @S from S |pg||
nt|marlowepi: S hand on the strong side for 3S, but a bit thinfor 4S|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@S?|pg||
nt|panja: if S bids 4@S, I guess small @H lead needed to defeat...|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S   looks on fpr n/s     5@C   some sort of save |pg||
nt|marlowepi: S might compromise with D, but i predict 4S after the huddle|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4@s is NOT preempt here|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|bobholl: straiigth forward 3 NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: 1@H is a playful effort|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hedyg: needs to lead @c|pg||
nt|andyv:  W's interest in anything more than game will be quickly disappear.|pg||
nt|lml: but West has a lot of HCP|pg||
nt|lml: he may be thinking bigger|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|hedyg: still down, but less so|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: west psyche has kept them out of 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: in nt defence have an unusual unblocking opportunity|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the club suit|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT might make if e/w do not take 5 club tricks early|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: max of 32 no fit ??|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: after the 1NT rebid, 3N automatic|pg||
nt|lml: they might have had a fit ... depends if East would bid a major|pg||
nt|lml: we don't|pg||
nt|lml: also East may not raise diamonds with a balanced hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: trump   trump best|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt a make|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|bobholl: if you play walsh you wouldn't but i play montreal so obliged to bid high color|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E is in a position to even think about raising diamonds, he has shape|pg||
nt|roswolf: west is tested|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this could go down too|pg||
nt|haans: to go down here is standard|pg||
nt|roswolf: west passed will east read it|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kiwibridge: passive lead|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S afraid it might be a cashout situation in the minors, hesitant to lead club in case N stuff is in diamonds and declarer could otherwise run trumps & hearts.  that Kx of hearts is ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a scary holding|pg||
nt|ady: should be down 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: official website : http://www.israbridge.com/home/results/2009/trl-final.pdf|pg||
nt|panja: when a small @D is now played to @DQ....South will have to win allowing E the @DK entry to the fourth Diamond, and a useful @S discard late in the day|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC : http://tinyurl.com/np5cm3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S would go down on heart lead. presumably the ace. heart ruff and club shift takes out dummy's entry prematurely and declarer has to lose 2 diamonds|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: you could change the ten of D into the king, giving E a supermax, and it still would be a poor slam|pg||
nt|ady: there are 8 triccks available in the red suits   but north does not know this|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah the blockage occurs|pg||
nt|roswolf: spade now|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|lml: Yes East won't raise diamonds with say 4-4-3-2 with the minors and slam could be there if East has a better hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: just possible for west to have K@S  but in that case the red suit queens both with east|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|kiwibridge: Levin so completely flat why did he pull it|pg||
nt|lml: East had a complete minimum some might say not an opening|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: I think there should be a heart ruff first  and then draw trump   and then quuen diamonds|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: unless 1D is semi-artificial, I don;t see why E would not raise diamonds with that shape. it is not MPs. you shouldn;t respond in a suit you don;t want to hear raised|pg||
nt|lml: it is a style thing I suppose|pg||
nt|lml: I like to distinguish between balanced hands and those with shape|pg||
nt|andyv:  E/W must bid up the line for W not to have trotted out one of his majors.|pg||
nt|lml: in my partnerships we bid 1NT unless unbalanced and have ways to check back|pg||
nt|lml: I do bid up the line too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too. but i like to raise pd also. i want my suits raised when he has support, so i expect he will too|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|panja: @HA lead would not work..against 4@S..|pg||

nt|Walddk2: One of the reasons why I am not fond of opening 1@D with 4-5 in the minors. Alon had every right to think that they had 10 diamonds between them|pg||
nt|hedyg: i have sympathy with N, 4@c was not leaddirecting since S was on lead vs @H|pg||

nt|marlowepi: makes, or miss a diamond slam. unless of course the checkback methods allow opener to make the 3-way distinction between diamond tolerance, secondary support,  and PRIMARY ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: saupport, along with everything else that checkback has to do|pg||
nt|ady: swing for e/w last hand|pg||
mb|1C|nt|hedyg: thinking 1NT?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lml: some people don't like opening 1NT on the South hand with a decent 5 card major|pg||
nt|bobholl: is upgraded 15-17 ore down graded12-14|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S by N now?|pg||
nt|andyv:  my objection is more along the lines that S has too many aces with the 5 card major|pg||
nt|andyv:  aces belong in suit contracts|pg||
nt|lml: it does look suit oriented|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't like that with a K in @H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too good and much too suit-oriented for 12-14|pg||
nt|lml: I am not much of a believer in upgrading but this is too good to be 14|pg||
nt|lml: I agree|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: reluctance to upgrade is understandable. but here the main issue for me is that suit-play orientation|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: slam now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: interesting overcall..|pg||
nt|ady: 3@H    around the limit for e/w|pg||
nt|hedyg: W will bid it if he needs to|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 3@H (i like @C better)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: was 3@D puppet?|pg||
nt|lml: Stayman|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Cl;osed Room have played 6 boards already|pg||
nt|ady: close game in hearts   but down on 4-1 trump split|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|haans: 6nt an easy make|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cold missed|pg||
nt|bobholl: in BBO it is 54 minors|pg||
pc|d6|nt|panja: 20-20 HCP division, NS own 2@S contract..but found it difficult to get there..|pg||
nt|lml: some people think it is minors but it can be puppet Stayman too|pg||
nt|lml: and it would make sense in this auction I suppose|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it can be whatever the agreement is. not limited to those 2 possibilities|pg||
nt|lml: I doubt North was looking too hard for a slam opposite 12-14 notrump|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: game over for Birman I fear|pg||
nt|lml: I was really asking not guessing but this seems a normal contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to comment when bids are unknown |pg||
nt|andyv:  i didn't see 3@d alerted|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
pc|cK|nt|haans: 2nt with 20-22?|pg||

nt|ady: e/w  in OR  will be delighted to find they have gained 2 imps|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hedyg: now some crossruffing|pg||
nt|panja: North could have overcalled 1@S, 4+ by agreement, or rebid 2@S on 2@H just now, secure in the knowledge that South held some values for his 2@D raise|pg||
nt|hedyg: his @ss were too bad to overcall that 4 card suit promising 5 cards|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: not exactly the lead director you want  |pg||
nt|panja: y|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: East- West are happy enough on this hand to take any tricks they can get|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|hedyg: no crossruffing?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my partnerships we agree to do that on all hands we defend|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|panja: as I mentioned, 4+ by agreement, if it is 5+ by agreement, N's holding is not good enough for a 1@S overcall|pg||

pc|d3|pg||

nt|lml: well the Herbst team doesn't mind these flat boards|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: could come back to you at the 4 level |pg||
nt|ady: looks like 1NT    e/w|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|bobholl: 1 imp a board is tough to overcome|pg||
nt|ady: e/w    1NT|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: he jsu wanted to get his leaddirector in early i think|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hedyg: just*|pg||
nt|ady: very flat 8 pts   not much prospect of any game|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: definitely high enough|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sybarra: N is just thrilled!|pg||
nt|bobholl: bit heavy 3@C if they play bergen|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: it is not clear to double here. hearts may be N's only suit|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I would think it is constructive not limit|pg||
nt|andyv:  bergan style...constructive....Qx of @d downgrades the hand|pg||
nt|lml: I agree |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Tempted by the state of the match, and all those nice intermediats|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: after the XX does N have to bid?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@HX was -1 with @d lead and repeated play|pg||
pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: depends what a bid shows and what a passs shows|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think 2@s should show a clear preference|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H was down one on almost any sensible defense|pg||
nt|panja: this late double is always risky..both in terms of making the right judgement, and getting a good score|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kiwibridge: the 470 has cost 9 imps|pg||
nt|haans: Birman will have a long day|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: at what point can they concede?|pg||
nt|haans: i dont think there are any rule about that in europe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like a 2S bid to me. why go to the 3 level till you have to when your suit is spades?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hedyg: there is a good chance that N has 4@hs so i really dont like the X by S|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: naybe N thinks he has a clear preference with spades lobger than Ds. also, you are less likely to be doubled if you bid it a sif you liked it|pg||
nt|haans: they cannot walk out now anyway|pg||
nt|andyv:  some like the security of knowing about the 4th trump|pg||
nt|marlowepi: values to less than 9 LTC, an easy 2S for me|pg||
nt|lml: its all these law of total tricks acolytes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they are not acolites:)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kiwibridge: :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would bid also 2@S|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|kiwibridge: plain sailing now|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|lml: I don't mind 3@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the Bergenoid mixed-raise argument makes tolerable sense when your major is hearts. but not in spades IMHBAICO|pg||
nt|lml: this hand is not that far from a limit raise and if you bid 2@S on too many hands it is hard for partner to judge|pg||
nt|lml: not to mention the destructive part of the bid|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: bidding 4@S was just guessing|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lml: but either way works sometimes|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||

pc|c5|nt|bobholl: 9 tricks !NEXT|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a winning guess by a team on form though|pg||

nt|hedyg: ty Yarden|pg||
nt|ritong: would you stayman west' hand, apart of that?|pg||
nt|nicksan: I always love it when the opponents stop in 2 NT or 3 @S against me. You can relax, as a wrong lead or switch will cost an overtrick and maybe an IMP. But if they continually bid ...|pg||
nt|nicksan: game it's a different story...|pg||
nt|ritong: and would you take a bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10 and 9 of  @s would incite me to bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: also my few hcps are not Jxx and Qxx..|pg||
nt|vugraphzux: And we'r back.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am with Henri; in the long run I think it's against the odds to bid on an 8-count and 4333|pg||

nt|roswolf: rehi|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: 6@D anyone|pg||
nt|bobholl: guessing is always nasty :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: LR=8 LTC. that hand was 9+ LTC so not close to a LR, if LTC is the yardstick used. i dont know of a better one|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: poor overcall     but ok when pard has KJ10XX clubs|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S is on for NS here..|pg||
nt|panja: and W has opted for an advanced sacrifice|pg||
nt|haans: not to easy bidding|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wouldn't expect it to be reached by anyone except us double dummy experts :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Blackwood not the right way|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: futile|pg||
nt|haans: may be tactical|pg||
nt|andyv:  meanwhile, unto board 5:)|pg||
nt|lml: I see pluses and minuses to both but what I really hate is using 1M-2M as 3 card constructive raise|pg||
nt|bobholl: in bergen 3@C is a normal 2@S with 4 trumps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the main "destructive" part of the mixed raise 3C is destroying our +110 by converting it to -100|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: rehi all|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|panja: sensing that 4@S is a make, but his hand is too balanced..|pg||
nt|hedyg: result will be corrected to -1|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@S a desperate bid by a desperate man|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome back Mike|pg||
pc|s4|nt|panja: note the Pass by North...it is a forcing pass...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree with that last comment linda|pg||
nt|bobholl: agree completely about the -100 part :)|pg||
nt|lml: 2@D was asking for a major|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: yes indeed it is|pg||
nt|ady: this is getting what is deserved   -4|pg||
nt|panja: showing an inability to bid higher, but an interest in doing so|pg||
nt|lml: on this hand it is better to find the 4-3 than the 5-2!|pg||
nt|lml: I like that lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  would prefer showing the majors with 4-5 pattern unless your pd is exceptional in 4-3 fits:)|pg||
nt|lml: when you have stuff play trump|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree. andy's point is that partner will bid the lower ranking suit with equal length|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the same principle applies to virutally all 2-suited bids when one suit is likely to be longer than the other|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: EW have forced them into their making slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that double of 5@S looks like penalty....not sure why North has removed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: trying to push them to 6@S lol|pg||
nt|haans: i think it was D0P1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or, if 4NT was Blackwood (of some kind), showing an even number of aces...in the sense that zero is even|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: long tank Levin|pg||
nt|haans: i say again 4nt tactical|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it was a great tactic Haans|pg||
nt|haans: yes he did right|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NS have done everything right so far - impressive|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: perhaps operator can tell us whats happening?|pg||
nt|vugraphzuw: thinking|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: must be a huge strain on his brain|pg||
nt|mdgraham: understandable|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: kibs are telling me he will bis 6@S|pg||
nt|haans: or pass or double|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6@S about -4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: however, 5@S put a lot of oomph into the auction. Easy to imagine a slightly different layout where both his aces cash.|pg||
nt|haans: i do not think double if a choice|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6@S probably better than pass, but without 5@S probably no 6@D|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kiwibridge: 2imps on 2 and a flat board on 3 so the gap now a mere 76|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: brb cat at the dorr|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ok nothing happened|pg||
nt|haans: diamond 3-0 may be a problem|pg||
nt|haans: 2-1 some problem too|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lml: what would you do on the West hand.  You could pass, double or bid 2@S if you don't like 2@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: better for the lower-ranking suit to be the longer one|pg||
nt|bobholl: good play :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: good @S7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: declarer has work to do. Clubs are all wrong and hearts are 4-2. |pg||
nt|haans: not to easy play little like chess|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lml: ducking is interesting|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|panja: the law of total tricks is not working perfectly here...10 card Club fit for EW, 8-card @S fit for NS..so LTT says 18 total tricks..|pg||
nt|hedyg: need to cash the @H tricks|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  can make 2@H    but no doubt west would have contested with 3@D   also a make|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: i dont think it is clear that the pass is forcing, assuming that 3C showed invitational or better values. S has forced at the 3 level, not at the 5 level. you CAN play the pass as ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: forcing by agreement, but it is not automatically so|pg||
nt|haans: low @H seems right|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to say if @s back wasn't more to the point|pg||
pc|s9|nt|panja: but NS have 10 in Spades, and EW have only 7 in Clubs..if NS cash their tricks in time|pg||
nt|hedyg: Panja send an email to LC :)|pg||
nt|panja: if 3@C is INV or better......you are not going to defend 5@C undoubled, are you?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: if you burn brain cells thinking oin this situatio n you will b e fried to a crisp long before the  match ends|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe he can't locate the pass cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  that had to hurt|pg||
nt|bobholl: this far behind you can't bid |pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree with the last three words|pg||
nt|lml: He is vulnerable... if he ever even thought about bidding that should stop him|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lml: maybe he was thinking about the lead :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: y, good double by E, thought somewhat risky, S could hold 4423 on a bad day...|pg||
nt|cindy:  i like this lead|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: will try to establish spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the pace of play here is a bit, shall we say, funereal|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@D has been passed out in other room so another big plus Herbst|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@H should be passed imo now game seems to be certain|pg||
nt|ady: 4@s  looks a make|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  N has to get ready for smooth duck|pg||
nt|hedyg: it will cost a trick but gain more|pg||

nt|mdgraham: this is a long match, and teams have come back from big deficits before....but the Birman team would not be human if they were not starting to get a bit disheartened|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lml: on the cards North-South make exactly 5@D because clubs are friendly|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont like this line. N should have laid down H ace ASAP|pg||
nt|ady: south has some useful cards  and 5th spade good|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I would have thought 3@S was forcing?|pg||
nt|roswolf: so would i|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphzuw: Ofir was suprised cus it is forcing|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: south probably devalued QJ@D   but Q@H useful   and 5th spade|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: his only chance is friendly clubs & heart Kx somewhere|pg||
nt|bobholl: N still has hopes @C this way @H KQ bare|pg||
nt|lml: its certainly possible after the C!J|pg||
nt|lml: @CJ|pg||

nt|hedyg: hard to play @d?|pg||
nt|hedyg: N has minors, seems right|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes it will make but still best D i think|pg||
nt|panja: NS face a Hobson's choice, allow @C ruff in Dummy, or allow trumps to be picked up without loser|pg||

nt|cindy:  how to get to @s ?|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 4@S  can make   e/w     difficult to bid|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thats a dismal 1@H overcall is it not?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bobholl: 3 @H now|pg||

nt|ady: pass best|pg||

nt|ady: can be 3 down|pg||
mb|3N|nt|panja: if it went 1Nt P P....surely, E could not be worried about opponents owning @Hs..so there had to be some way to go slow and try and find @S fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4441 shape and chunky trumps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no, E will be the one with 2 hearts and he has to follow to the clubs. need heart ace early, as i said a while back, and then play clubs hoping for favorable position. why restrict ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: yes me tend to be cheaper|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he raised you|pg||
nt|lml: you could easily get to high on this hand|pg||
nt|lml: South did well to bid only 3|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: 3nt is too committal for me|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory|pg||
nt|ady: this  is a make    lucky lie of clubs and spades  can make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this can make with the finesses right and even splits etc|pg||
nt|roswolf: but when opps stretch out their necks you must jump on them |pg||
nt|ady: will have to take an immediate spade finesse  and play clubs      no good playing on diamonds   no time|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bobholl: but what would 3@H have been 56 or so ?|pg||
nt|lml: which is the right bid certainly playing weak notrump|pg||
nt|andyv:  6 from 76 in middle of hand?|pg||
nt|lml: I play it as a splinter|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: I think South is sacrificing here|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: multilandy works here, X showing 5+m and 4M|pg||
nt|ady: probably 2@D   conventional     I think 3@D  a sensible bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: but unusual to do that with 7 cards @d|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lml: and you could bid that too|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cindy:  only problem with 3@d is it preempts finding their @s fit|pg||

pc|hA|nt|kiwibridge: 6 board 90 minutes how very dreary|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
nt|ady: can make this way    but dont think right play giving up KX clubs in north hand    now needs spaded finesse and break|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cindy:  maybe W owed E a bid since he did bid red at 3 level|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|roswolf: any black card|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: probably like most of us  "semi" |pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@s is either mini 5+ or 6 cards|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks not too difficult|pg||
nt|hedyg: @H or @c?|pg||
nt|vugraphzuw: "toilet brake"|pg||
nt|cindy:  im not big on leading doubletons but think i would lead a @h this time|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 5@C a bit precipitate?|pg||
nt|ady: if 4@C is forcing   I like the 5@C   to show good clubs and no controls in diamonds or spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: ruff 3 clubs best|pg||
nt|hedyg: Itamar is the brother of the E player in the open room|pg||
nt|ady: may find it difficult to get back and forth|pg||
nt|ady: must cash 2nd diamond before ruffing 3rd club|pg||
nt|hedyg: what about A@D, @d ruff and small @s?|pg||
nt|ady: not for me      would win A@D    club ruff a club then heart    and ruff another club|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely must play on the @ds|pg||
nt|hedyg: and remember that E did not lead trump in a situation where it would seem the obvious lead|pg||
nt|ady: can afford to lose 3 trump tricks if losing nothing else     must surely ruff those losing clubs|pg||
nt|ady: see 4@S   went down in OR|pg||
nt|hedyg: tried that in OR and went -1, AK@D disc 1@H A@c , @c ruff, @H and @c ruff, A@H and @h ruff, overruff and K@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: still had to lose 1@c and 2@ss|pg||
nt|panja: how about xruf?|pg||
nt|hedyg: played it a lot faster than Ofir Herbst...still on break?|pg||
nt|ady: has to decide how to go back to hand   diamond ruff   or  heart ruff     was unlucky to get overruffed in hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzuw: thinking :P|pg||
nt|panja: @DAK discarding a @H, @CA, @C ruff, @HK, @Cruff, @HA ruff, @C ruff|pg||
nt|hedyg: after A@H there is no @c ruff|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the wrong hand then to ruff @c|pg||
nt|panja: well, @H ruff can be high..|pg||
nt|hedyg: with A@S?|pg||
nt|panja: y..but that is too double dummy a line..|pg||
nt|ady: if you win this   and A@C    club ruff    heart to the king and c lub ruff  then heart to the ace    cash 2nd dimond   if you play 3rd diamond   surely you make    but it is a ...|pg||
nt|ady: nasty guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: a bit too DD :)|pg||
nt|haans: spade lead hearts finesses = slam|pg||
nt|lml: its tough to make after the clun lead though|pg||
nt|lml: club|pg||
nt|lml: maybe not|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H back ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  fortunate lie of cards make 4@h an odds on favorite|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what am i missing? isnt this cold?|pg||
nt|lml: the heart play will depend on the rest of the hand|pg||
nt|lml: it is cold but it can go down |pg||
nt|andyv:  it is cold and N has few options|pg||
nt|lml: what happens on a heart lead now|pg||
nt|lml: for example|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ace wins and running ten wins|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @H back always down |pg||
nt|bobholl: sry not true|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  when K@h falls, can just play @c off board|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lml: he has to rise here|pg||
nt|lml: this is the tricky part of the hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: had E led a low club, N would probably have ducked, but N was worried about spade shift|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is clear to rise|pg||
nt|lml: is it obvious to rise.  I was thinking about that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very unlikely that E would underlead heart king in this position|pg||
nt|bobholl: also with 26 cards in sigth :)|pg||
nt|lml: I am not so sure about that|pg||
nt|lml: why wouldn't he underlead|pg||
nt|bobholl: i meant a ? after the 26|pg||
nt|lml: lets say hearts are 2-2|pg||
nt|lml: is ducking right or rising?|pg||
nt|andyv:  not underleading from kx|pg||
nt|lml: I can see he isnt ... he has Jxx|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, playing A can't cost while ducking can|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for example, playing more clubs might kill dummy so that would be an option he would consider for a long time|pg||
nt|andyv:  also, if E started with Kxx, he may well have lead a trump|pg||
nt|lml: he might have|pg||
nt|lml: he might not too|pg||
nt|bobholl: he thinks long eneough about it :)|pg||
nt|lml: its hard|pg||
nt|bobholl: enough|pg||
nt|lml: and its the contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  i think it's almost automatic to lead trump from kxx in these auctions|pg||
nt|lml: this is where you should take time|pg||
nt|lml: I don't know.  Sometimes you have to cash your winners on preempt hands.  But maybe East hasn't read your book :)|pg||
nt|lml: I think he will get it right though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N is not wondering whether E has Kx of hearts (or Kxx). he is wondering whether to plkay W for KJx, which means throwing club on diamond and playing for spade finesse on|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|ady: on that bassis there is a case for north to bid 6|pg||

nt|bobholl: this is ok now @C|pg||

pc|sK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lml: well done North|pg||
nt|lml: whatever he was thinking about :)|pg||
nt|lml: winning players get these things right and North is a winning player|pg||
nt|lml: I like this deal a lot.  I think it is blog worthy.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: rising was the correct play. if W had followed small, then he would have had to try the other line|pg||
nt|andyv:  E needed to lead a @c and @h at same time|pg||
nt|lml: I think with all the clues North had that rising was right and that is how North got there|pg||
nt|marlowepi: andy is putting it in his blog as we speak|pg||
nt|lml: You have a blog too Andy :)|pg||
nt|ady: ruff a heart|pg||

pc|d5|nt|ady: home now|pg||
nt|andyv:  yeap..-300|pg||
nt|lml: he can make one more if he plays a heart|pg||
nt|andyv:  hoping to keep W off lead but just not possible|pg||
nt|lml: the oppos have 4 spades and a heart to casg|pg||
nt|lml: I think it is safe to play a heart|pg||
nt|lml: I am trying to think of when it costs?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is not safe but it is the best play|pg||
nt|lml: he could cash out his 4 tricks but I don't think the heart can cost.  the most the opps can take is 2 hearts and 4 spades.  He still gets 4 tricks|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think East can have 6 spades ?|pg||
nt|lml: he passed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thy have 2 already. 5 more is down one|pg||

pc|dK|nt|cindy:  on this bidding @d finesse rates to work|pg||
nt|lml: they have various names.  I play them|pg||
nt|lml: 2 of a major shows 5 in the major and 4 in a minor weak|pg||
nt|lml: not usually that weak|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then you won't want to hear my names for them:)|pg||
nt|lml: I play them as 5-5|pg||
nt|lml: I think it works very well.  It has helped me to get to slams.  |pg||
nt|lml: as well as destructive|pg||
nt|andyv:  W hand didn't scream loud enough for 3N|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  2nd from 5 bad leads|pg||
nt|marlowepi: easy to believe that those bids don;t prevent you from getting to slams. as for destruction, how about they goad the opps into bidding a game they would not otherwise bid, plus ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you've also given them a blueprint of how to make it when they otherwise would be favorites to go down. in my experience that is routine. but to each blogger his/her own:)|pg||
nt|lml: he got the bad right|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will get nicked 1|pg||
nt|lml: yes he has a blueprint on this one|pg||
nt|lml: he knows the hearts arent breaking|pg||
nt|andyv:  no blueprint...4 losers no matter how you slice it|pg||
nt|lml: I know :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N of far more interest with a small @d lead from N|pg||
nt|lml: I was thinking about whether you can make 3NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  as cards lie, yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i can understand the appeal of those 2-bids when they show a real opening with shape, because then the odds that you will play the hand are much higher so the info about shape can ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: be very useful constructively. but when weak they just give so much free info away to the other side who are favorites to declare|pg||
nt|lml: the reason that I have found they work so well on those hands is the tradeoff between info and level is good|pg||
nt|lml: yes if the opponents still get to the right contract it can be helpful|pg||
nt|lml: but they dont always|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: n/s  24 hcp     3NT should make  as they lay|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  couldn't figure out what to do on it?|pg||
nt|lml: the only reson not to claim is to use up NOrth's brain cells|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, S passed originally, used a sandwich NT and then ran to 2@c which got dbld.|pg||
nt|andyv:  another overused and abused convention... the sandwich NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: IMAGINE passing that S hand :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i call it the baloney sandwich|pg||
nt|andyv:  as much as I like to bid, I'm usually happy to keep quiet when I have a 3 count|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you mean you dont want to show the opps your hand? not very sportinbg of you|pg||
nt|andyv:  actually, I don't like to show anyone those hands...not even the kibitzers:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  meanwhile, we have been put into the deep freeze by N|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably wondering if it's possible that pd bid on 2 points:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  in which case he might have to lead a low club:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: low club useless as he is marked with the ace due to dubious double|pg||

nt|marlowepi: them. i guess when you use that convention BOTH partners want to show their hands to declarer:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|hedyg: this is the 1st of 8 segments of 16 boards each|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: thx all    have to leave      all enjoy|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1st plus to birman this set a big 3|pg||
nt|lml: part of the issue is how bad can you be for that bid.  It is not a hand I would have opened 2@s|pg||
nt|bobholl: negative free bid ?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hedyg: ty David, bye|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: cu David|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|lml: I like to actually have high cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|andyv:  probably a one rd force |pg||
nt|marlowepi: bob, i would say it this way: WHEN they gain, it would have to be in the bidding. still an open questio n what the longterm balance sheet is in high level competition|pg||
nt|lml: actually some times they do gain on defense too.  |pg||
nt|lml: information goes both ways|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  very little drama to this hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|kiwibridge: the inevitable 3N|pg||
nt|haans: 15 min a board close to 16|pg||
nt|bobholl: which colour are you going to develop @H is the worst choice|pg||
nt|andyv:  and another big swing forn N/S as they didn't get to game on OR|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on previous hand, personally i think it automatic for W to bid game. for example, game failed by one on 4-0 break, so how bad was it?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kiwibridge: really poor|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bobholl: N now informing what high low means :)|pg||
nt|lml: North can easily go down here|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree automatic to bid game...but, S balanced in 4th seat...knowing 10 of S's cards, a bad break in @hs is very likely, so 3N should be preferable.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hedyg: 8@C was treacherous lead, hard to guess long @cs in N|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bobholl: costly @C 8 |pg||
nt|lml: I confess that if the last card I would discard|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: amazing card to play|pg||
nt|andyv:  so was 9@s|pg||
nt|lml: declarer must be wondering if West is tricking him with the club|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This can make now, A@C and another would have knocked it|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c8|pg||
nt|ady: this likely to go down 1    2@H might or might not make  |pg||
nt|mcarroll: @C switch also works of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump back defeats it also a diamond perhaps|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bobholl: now it is possible to make it without  further assistance|pg||
nt|lml: but he will still play clubs now|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: he might be wondering that but he doesnt have many options|pg||

nt|roswolf: a simple game hand - i cant see an accident happening here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks in spades or diamonds for n/s|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe i am wrong|pg||
nt|ady: off beat 1NT by east   trying to get a swing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: NS have 12 tricks, but 2 @C losers|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mcarroll: Actually 13 as @H finess works!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: will east persist?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  i wonder what 1N would be by E|pg||
nt|lml: I wouldnt bid here but maybe South will|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lml: no surprise.  It is their style|pg||
nt|bobholl: the 2 overtricks are not counting that much here but at MP would be near 99%|pg||
nt|lml: for sure... |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: why double instead of 1NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a club lead is not obvious|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mcarroll: All depends on the lead|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  maybe 1N is something else|pg||
nt|lml: buit the 10 imps are helpful|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobholl: too thin 15|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, only 3 stoppers in opps suit...probably not enough:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 13 tricks thanks very much|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: I've just watched an entire concert DVD by Drive-by-Truckers while they played a paltry 12 boards|pg||
nt|haans: will levin try for slam now?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: next up is Neil Young's Heart of Gold|pg||
nt|lml: 1NT would probably have led to the same contract|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well then pass. you have no suit and 40% of yr stuff is in their suit, and both are red. |pg||
nt|andyv:  any reason to xfer with W hand over 1N?|pg||
nt|bobholl: the T of @H would have led me to 1nt indeed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: personally i wd bid 1NT in a nanosecond|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|nt|hedyg: some play double of 2@c here as asking pd NOT to lead @c|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: and he did right. had to try|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|hedyg: hard to read S's number of @cs from 5@c and then 7|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS lead 2/4, also in pd suit, but small shows an honour|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he could not lead the 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: nor the 4..|pg||
nt|haans: do you agree with 3@D spec say no no no|pg||
nt|haans: i say not prefect|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kiwibridge: 3@D merely expresses a wish to play a suit contract|pg||

nt|haans: agree to that|pg||

nt|ritong: now he has two main options|pg||
nt|nicksan: South may not know where the @C 9 is... if he doesn't persist in clubs, this could make...|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ritong: 1) play the @dK hoping to pin @d JX initially|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ritong: 2) play @h Q hoping somthing good happens afterwards|pg||
nt|ritong: an other plan was to play three rounds of @cs, but dummy has to discard on the third and this was annoying|pg||
nt|nicksan: As South has indeed continued clubs, I think the defence should prevail now...|pg||
nt|ritong: now he always have the @d Jx solution, guess he will try that taking the @c in dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: Q@c and small @s to jack?|pg||
nt|ritong: bets on:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: then if S plays Q@s he must unblock jack|pg||
nt|nicksan: So, win Ace and finesse spades. South cleares his clubs. Now cash two hearts, finesse in spades again and throw South in with a club...|pg||
nt|hedyg: a @c comes back pull 2@hs finesse in @s and endplay in @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: right!|pg||

nt|andyv:  5@h any one?|pg||
nt|bobholl: how many @H you start bidding ?|pg||
nt|ady: well they could have played in a definate making game|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lml: 4@H seems normal enough|pg||
nt|roswolf: the off shape nt created an opportunity but west was not inspired|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: another possible slam - and this one is solid|pg||
nt|andyv:  i prefer 5@h...4@h is always a xfer to 4@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: only 8 in canadian linda|pg||
nt|lml: can North-South get to the grand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sybarra: and likely another push |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: will NS reach this slam, another nail in the coffin?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: amazed W did not bid 5H or something|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: difficult now|pg||
nt|bobholl: now N can bid 5@H|pg||
mb|2S|nt|haans: hard for SA to find slam|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: is 4@D leaping michaels|pg||
nt|haans: leaping michaels|pg||
nt|lml: he was saving that for North|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: nice cue|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South won't like his @CKJx|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S natural if you have spades|pg||
mb|2N|nt|hedyg: with a very good view can make 6 @d but that is more than double dummy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think 5H is inadequate. why not 6H by N?|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't see them reach 7 now|pg||
nt|lml: he could bid it now|pg||
nt|lml: 6@h|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N knew in advance that S would bid 5S|pg||
nt|lml: he cant be worried about trump or he would bid 5NT so he is looking for something else|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@d now?|pg||
nt|lml: 6@D is okay if that is not a suit for certain|pg||
nt|lml: I would bid 6@H|pg||
nt|lml: see if partner can get there|pg||
nt|lml: or maybe just 7@S|pg||
nt|bobholl: only chance is guess 7 @S but guessing it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT  may well be the contract    lekely to faul|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: would need to play for doubleton J@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: dont belive it|pg||
nt|vugraphzuw: me too :S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but North likes his hand....|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I prefer CRASH michaels 4@C shows the red suits, still well reached|pg||
nt|mdgraham: how did he know South had an ace? and four trumps?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perhaps there was more to 4@S than we know about|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed as these two seem to know EXACTLY what they are doing - top stuff indeed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Jim Gordon suggests 4@S was cue, as South was a passed hand|pg||
nt|haans: 4@D was not alerted|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I suggested that too|pg||
nt|haans: natural and 4@S cue?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which is all very reasonable|pg||
nt|andyv:  N didn't want to have an accident|pg||
nt|lml: I think 6@S is reasonable when you are up by a lot of imps anyway|pg||
nt|marlowepi: interesting. i weould think that is most important time not to miss a grand|pg||
nt|lml: well Birman finally got the swing hand they were looking for|pg||
nt|lml: a lot of the specs think North should have bid the grand|pg||
nt|lml: the argument is that there is nothing left for partner except more or less what he has|pg||
nt|bobholl: agree they will bid it at the other table :) !|pg||
nt|andyv:  at other table auction much quicker, N just bid 7@s over 4@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  so much for science:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: and 11 more to Herbst. Getting really serious|pg||
nt|lml: I think North might have bid 7@S if he wasnt leading by so much|pg||
nt|ady: might make on a diamond lead|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: 2@s is 4sf, does not promise a stopper in @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 3@s by S now would ask for a stopper|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Ilan Shefizi for putting on a fine show.|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well, it is hard to know about hypotheticals, but i would assume that having a healthy lead is exactly the time you would bid a grand|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mdgraham: Thanks to Hans Sjostrom (Sweden) and Gary Hanna (New Zealand) for commentary. I am Mike Graham (England). Also thanks to all spectators for some useful and perceptive comments. |pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: hmmm this 6@d should be possible|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like a lot to do |pg||
mb|2C|nt|mdgraham: Congratulations to all of you who lasted the course.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: since the opps are likely to, particularly in a set tht hasnt hd that many opportunities for the trailing team|pg||
nt|bobholl: only argument is that the other table will be there too :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: play on @hs, let E make a @d by overruffing|pg||
nt|hedyg: then play AK@D, ruff 1 more @H, ruff 1@c and disc 1 @c on the last @H|pg||
mb|2N|nt|haans: more and more have seen it (open room closed long ago)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well, that "only" argument is more than enough|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|sybarra: hmm now what |pg||
nt|hedyg: usually the 3@d bid shows 4cards...|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @D  and then what|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 5 @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s was cuebid|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kiwibridge: thanks Mike and Haans it has been a pleasure, albeit a stretched out one|pg||
nt|haans: true |pg||
nt|bobholl: 9 of @H makes it tricky (made)|pg||
nt|lml: well actually I am going to eat soemthing first.   Back to you in less than an hour|pg||
nt|lml: sorry |pg||
nt|lml: that was private|pg||

nt|marlowepi: chocolate cake is good BBO food|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: 4@s was natural in case N had 5/6 @d and 4 @ss|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably 5C over 3S would have been void-showing (possibly exclusion). otherwise it might be an appealing call|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Misunderstanding in the open room. South's jump to 3@C interpreted as promising a fit for hearts|pg||
nt|haans: herbst end it nice|pg||
nt|lml: right now I would eat most anything but spinach|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kiwibridge: will there be a concession or will I need more coffee for the next set :)|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: now for the challenge |pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont think you can time it for making 6 |pg||
nt|hedyg: as "runnerup" says the line works if you play AK@D first as well|pg||
nt|marlowepi: seems fairlyu straightforward to make this by setting up hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: if you try ruffing 2@cs you are down|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hedyg: sometimes @hs are even 3-3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: well this should help|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont need 33 hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will help |pg||

nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Emmylou just winked at me I think|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hedyg: now just need @d split|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this lead gives declarer options, i.e. trying to cater to 4 trumps in the W hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: N knew from the 5 @H bid that S did not have the Q@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: but nowhere to go from the 5 @H level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you're making me jealous|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it worked for popeye|pg||
nt|lml: specs who are sending me messages about food are cruel|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i always thought he should eat papaya|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Birman has broken into 3 figures|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 71 is still a LLLOOOOTTTT|pg||
nt|lml: at the moment it is 23-20 for Birman.  In the end not much change so far|pg||
nt|marlowepi: just a few pennnies|pg||

nt|haans: good tactical play by N and E|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: to all spec Thanks - your feedback has been great|pg||

mb|2N|nt|marlowepi: different folks have different views about how to open hands like N. put me down for 1D|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Itamar you have done a great job, thanks from all of us|pg||
nt|mdgraham: This is very impressive by the Herbst team. No so much scoring 142 but in conceding only 25 imps in 48 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzuw: thank you|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: you are playing winning bridge if you concede one-and-a-half imps a board. Half an imp per board is incredible.|pg||
