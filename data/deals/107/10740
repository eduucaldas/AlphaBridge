nt|shevek: The top 8 teams advance to the KO stage|pg||

nt|petergill: Marion Michielsen did well to deduce that the ruff and discard @H play might weaken declarer's trumps, and would not cost when partner discouraged clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: The players for Team 42 include Robert Stephens (North) from South Africa, Andy Hung at the other table from Australia, Jorrit Schafer from Europe|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|shevek: EW bid 3NT on this one|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|petergill: EW playing a modern style, 2@C = clubs or extras, 2@D = artificial/weak I think|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@H = 5+@S, 4+@H, extra strength as went via 2@C |pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C = 5413, about 18 after West's repeated weak noises|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Marion will give 3NT a try now|pg||
nt|petergill: The names are really North: Stephens, West: Michielsen|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: A club lead looks normal. What possible 5 tricks could the defence take?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petergill: 2 @D's, one spade, a heart and what else? Perhaps dummy can become locked into conceding a heart a the end?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|petergill: So declarer perhaps does best to win @CJ, then finesse @HJ as the cards lie, but that is not necessarily the best line, if South has @HK|pg||

nt|petergill: organisers|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps South does best to take one or two @D's then exit a spade to lock declarer in dummy OR maybe ....|pg||
nt|murat e: best is to give back a spade then declarer has to guess correctly in hearts|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|nt|petergill: or exit a club so that if declarer later exits @HA then a heart, North is not endplayed to give declarer an entry to hand via @CJ|pg||

nt|petergill: Very good defence indeed by Zviko|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||

nt|petergill: Murat was right = a spade exit makes declarer's task harder'|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|shevek: easy slam with no problems in play |pg||
nt|Walddk6: 6@S is a super contract, but it may not be so easy to reach if E-W interfere with lots of diamonds|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk6: Like now by Marion|pg||
nt|Walddk6: 3NT perhaps|pg||
nt|petergill: would be bold, but wise at the suitable vulnerability?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk6: Even 3@D will make Drijver noisy|pg||
nt|petergill: if 3NT here shows the minors - does your partnership have that agreement, specs?|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@h would suit both - cue and shortage :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D for the lead is what I would have called|pg||
mb|3H|mb|5D|nt|Walddk6: The rest is guesswork for N-S|pg||

mb|5S|mb|p|nt|petergill: How does a 7@D save go?|pg||
nt|shevek: south did the best he could|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Stephens can't really bid more. For all he knows, they could have two diamond losers. But you never know with juniors|pg||
nt|petergill: I think he will bid 6@S|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Give South @CA instead of @DA|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: With two @D losers, I think Robert Stephens would expect Zviko to pass 5@D |pg||

mb|1H|nt|shevek: 4@s seems like a good contract|pg||
nt|petergill: Bulletin 1 also says that 3 tables each session, randomly chosen, will be asked to empty pockets and bags to check that no cell phones have found their way into the playing area|pg||
mb|1S|mb|3H|nt|shevek: trumps a bit unfriendly|pg||
nt|josj: and/or other prohibited articles :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H preemptive|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: What else would be prohibited? Bribe money to convince the Bulletin Editor to only write up your good hands?  :)|pg||

nt|ritong: hi guys|pg||
nt|Walddk6: You don't drink, Jos|pg||
nt|shevek: entries to dummy's clubs might be a problem, maybe declarer should duck a club early?|pg||
nt|murat e: normally this should make|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|josj: right, and I am working next door :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Trumps 4-1 offside makes the play interesting|pg||
nt|josj: Molenaar went down...|pg||
nt|murat e: ruff a heart and play a dia|pg||
nt|petergill: Zviko Siderov is very experienced, giving it a lot of thought|pg||
nt|murat e: trump spots are good enough|pg||
nt|petergill: Zviko played fro Bulgaria youth in Poiana (2009), Beijing (2008) and Jesolo (2007)|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Murat's line is based on the idea that if @DK loses to @DA (bad news), then @SK must be onside ...|pg||
nt|shevek: in the CR declarer played @c to J and Q, east cashed @dA and @dx was won in dummy!|pg||
nt|shevek: and that was goodbye to clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: (other table) then declarer basically played for  trumps 3-2, or someone with 4 trumps also having 3 clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: I think that this is the sign of a good player - someone who thinks the play through at Trick 1, before the problems appear|pg||
nt|ritong: the hand is very difficult, also|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ritong: so many options|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s3|pc|h4|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|shevek: if they get into the auction that is....|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@S = a doubleton spade, else he would raise earlier, in their methods, I think|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk6: The question is whether one should give preference to spades when looking at four clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk6: I know 2@C could be three cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|petergill: If @DA was ducked on that last hand, declarer ruffs another heart, and can simply cash @CAK and claim, so it looks like it was the best play|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk6: The problem with 2@S is that partner, like here, will rush to game. You don't really want that with all your high cards in the wrong suits|pg||
