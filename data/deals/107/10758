mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|dslee: For all the viewers, Keyzad and Swarnendu are two new additions to the Sree Cements team, Rana Roy had dropped out this time for medical reasons|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcwla: We'll start with Board 1 and continue through 16.  The OR will start with 14 and then circle back to 1, so we'll be providing them with the comparisons.|pg||

nt|bobholl: 4 @H good contract but will go down|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|vugraphzau: Welcome Sunit|pg||

mb|p|nt|guthi: A straight forward auction here. |pg||
mb|2N|nt|sunit: bidding looks funny, how come jeroo mango invited her partner???|pg||
nt|sunit: she has a clear cut 4h bid after partner has opened 2cl precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|guthi: Hi all. |pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcwla: 2@H so much more commital than double.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Hello Bob, Guthi and Martin|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Just really don't like this 2@H -- the @H's are moth-eaten, it's too commital, the whole hand is a leaky dike.  North to blame for any bad here.|pg||
nt|dslee: For all the specs, Sridhar and Tewary are not a regular partnership, they are playing here since Sunder Ram (sridhar's ptr) & Honey prabhakar(Tewary's ptr) could not make it to ...|pg||
nt|dslee: this tourney|pg||

nt|vugraphzau: Rs 12,50,000 total prize money...www.hcl-bridge.com|pg||
nt|jcwla: Light opener, but 2.5 quick tricks and a good opening suit.|pg||
nt|dslee: 4@S NS, or a 5@D sac from EW|pg||

mb|p|nt|dslee: the richest person on the table gets a chance to bid last :)|pg||
nt|guthi: a light opener from East here.|pg||
nt|rvg: Though I would go low with Ian's hand - 5-3-3-2 hands play poorly even with 5-5 fits|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Good hand for Precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|mandala r: by the way prec players r very few in India|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|kiwibridge: theres no source of trick here, 2 down|pg||
nt|guthi: Good, they kept out of the club slam.|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@C needs too much luck in @S (Q doubleton) so is a roland slam|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes 10 tricks available in NT, and 2 losers in the @C slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: Texan Aces topped the swiss league with 193imps...Mango was 2nd with 185 imps|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|guthi: worked well, it could be systemic to open two Aces and one King any shape.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|jcwla: lots of losers here -- 5@H would make w/o a @C lead.|pg||
nt|dslee: YEs, and if its not the opening lead, then there is no other time W can lead it unfortunately and the contract will make|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: sorry guys got to close this table as south not co-operating with me..see ya for second round|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: cant see his cards and requested him thrice to keep the cards open for a sec for me to punch ..says no|pg||
nt|dslee: Mahesh ask Buddy to talk to swarnendu|pg||

pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|guthi: declarer will no doubt preserve entries into his hand. |pg||
pc|c7|pg||

pc|sT|nt|guthi: Indeed, Texan Aces are the defending champions. |pg||
nt|vugraphzau: www.hcl-bridge.com|pg||

nt|guthi: south could have shifted to a @H? |pg||
nt|guthi: nice 10 card fit for EW, this should be a fast auction.|pg||
nt|rvg: This is an example of why switching to H7 from 987 (current expert practice) can be wrong at times|pg||
nt|rvg: Had Archie played a Club from dummy GV would have had a guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: with @c Q in east hand he would have finnesed|pg||
nt|rvg: A cold 3N for EW|pg||
nt|guthi: Like yesterday we won't have any comparisons for some time. The other room started with board 30.|pg||
nt|bobholl: but guessing what will happen is fun too :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: yes mind you he doesnt get in to play both @H and @C|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
nt|don paulus: looks like has to lead @c|pg||

pc|sK|nt|mandala r: almost equal pnts but no interferencs|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not one peep from West, wow.|pg||
nt|dslee: Great, pass on the message to Key that in most of the deals, Swarnendu shd be the dummy|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the curse of Precision are the 1444's 6@C has a good play|pg||
nt|bobholl: they prevented a nv 3 nt :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|othered1: but the double with no high major suit cards, a sub-minmum and misfit argue against action|pg||
nt|guthi: This could be 4 down :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rvg: I guess at this stage nobody wants to take an unusual action such as making this light negative double|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|dslee: 2 or 3 depending on how @C are handled and @H are played, I am sure Key will play the safe way without taking @H fin|pg||

nt|bobholl: @H or @D partial guess @D|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Have they a weak 2@D available?|pg||
nt|bobholl: precision so guess not|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Of course Bob - Forgot they are playing Precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Sartaj Hans|pg||
nt|rvg: OK :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess E will open nt w will transfer|pg||
nt|guthi: Lets see if North bids 3@H in 2nd seat with this.|pg||
nt|guthi: Preempts in 2nd seat should be better than 1st and 3rd seat preempts. |pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Looks like 3NT here.  Meanwhile, the OR has now circled back to Board 1.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: should be a routine 4@s ew|pg||
mb|p|nt|mandala r: depends how he playe h|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: wont reach after 1nt opening|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Interesting hand,3NT or 4@S the choices for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|mandala r: r they playing prec?|pg||
nt|bobholl: what did we say ?|pg||
nt|guthi: They chose to pass :P|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dslee: 2@C -2@D-3NT|pg||
nt|guthi: 3@S is game forcing, its lot of bidding imo. |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|guthi: Dbl is 5-7 I suppose. |pg||
nt|guthi: Interesting 2@D, can we have an explaination Mahesh?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: LOL|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mandala r: yhen why not 1-c?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|don paulus: whats the range for 1 nt ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: e/w playing 16-18 NT and 19+ @c|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes good way to play it same with me|pg||
pc|cA|nt|don paulus: ok thx|pg||
nt|mandala r: 4-4 spade fit gone|pg||
nt|don paulus: no stayman ?|pg||
nt|don paulus: anyway should make|pg||
nt|jcwla: Got your message about being dummy.|pg||
nt|sartaj1: South is aiming to right-side the contract opposite spade-short honours in the north hand; Qx ; AJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bobholl: luckky @S position so will make|pg||
nt|guthi: 3@D will keep.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|rvg: I have changed my profile so kibitzers can talk to me|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mandala r: gets lead benefit|pg||
nt|guthi: This should be over fast. |pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|sK|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Quite a choice|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kiwibridge: you would hope so|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|guthi: We have our first IMP exchage of this segement, 3 to Team Mango, they were allowed to make 4@H on the first board.|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|don paulus: declarer may expect K @h in S|pg||
nt|sartaj1: looks like 11 comfortable tricks after this start|pg||
nt|rvg: NS in a bad contract - A 2C bid would have worked better|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|othered1: On th is hand, but many play that bidding M - m - and later M shows a better hand than M - M - m.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dslee: this was a friendly lead for Key|pg||
nt|bobholl: started with 2 rounds of @S so @C loser disappeared|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|rvg: Yes - so witth this hand you just pass partner's probably 2H preference|pg||
pc|d3|nt|don paulus: see :)|pg||
nt|guthi: nice catch :) |pg||
pc|d4|nt|sartaj1: West knows that East has only 3-4 points; so a heart switch (even if east has the H!K) is pointless|pg||
nt|sartaj1: He must be trying to construct the one layout where 3NT can be defeated; will give up very soon i reckon !|pg||
nt|dslee: yes, prospect of a @H move now and benefits if any|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|guthi: I think the % play in the suit is to finesse again, but in the light of the bidding and entry issues ... |pg||
nt|othered1: And the @H suit feels to good to treat as only a 5-card suit.  Maybe a very sound weak 2 would describe the hand better, but it wouldn't get to @C either.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kiwibridge: we'll never know why some drag it out|pg||

nt|don paulus: or 2 ?|pg||
nt|jcwla: On Board 1 in the OR, Venktesh made the much more flexible choice of doubling 2@C rather than bidding 2@H.  The defense has been excellent and will be rewarded with what looks like ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: 500.|pg||
nt|guthi: no danger of playing clubs here before drawing trumps. but.|pg||
nt|guthi: we'll never know!|pg||
nt|guthi: A routine 3NT for NS here.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all finesses working :)|pg||
nt|guthi: ah, now we'll never know what happened :) Doesnt matter for the score, so, np.|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: west claimed in last 4 card position..hoping decl was out of trumps..director called|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: now back...director ruled 1 down|pg||
nt|guthi: seems they are all edgy, playing such a close match. |pg||
nt|othered1: wonder if north will weak 2?|pg||
nt|rvg: In their style they do open light in 1st position|pg||
nt|rvg: JM is a big advocate of that|pg||
nt|othered1: In favor of it, preemption.  Against, bad suit, bad vul., and too good for play in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: So 12 to Texan Aces.|pg||
nt|guthi: Thanks for the info Mahesh.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|dslee: I am sure South had a happy beginning in the open room :)|pg||
nt|guthi: They might reach 4@S here. |pg||
nt|bobholl: E 1@S will S bid 2nt ? or vulnarable too weak?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: Pass ?|pg||
nt|guthi: wonder what their 1NT opening range is, for NS. |pg||
nt|vugraphzau: 15-16|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 12/13 to 15 I guess|pg||
nt|guthi: If south opens 1NT, NS will most likely stop in 2@H|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|rvg: I wouldn't advocate that opening but just sharing my knowledge of their style - light first & 3rd position|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|guthi: North choose to pass with the 12 count, interesting.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mandala r: he has 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: 4 @h 3 @s rest must come from @c and/or @d|pg||
nt|don paulus: depends on lead|pg||
nt|othered1: Play is more than good enough for vul 4@S.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|guthi: I guess 15-16, its popular in India to play this range.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx operator|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: rather limited I would suggest 15-18 far superior as is 12-15|pg||
nt|guthi: Team Mango is from the west of India (Mumbai/Bombay) where precision systems are 'standard' :) |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: CCWei would be turning|pg||
nt|rvg: Now a Heart lead will sell the contract!|pg||
nt|bobholl: oops now it migth(will) make|pg||
nt|mcarroll: E may balance with 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: I am sure Key choosen to lead a @H over a @D because of the NT bid from Tiwari mostly denying major, but @D lead would had restricted in this deal|pg||
nt|sartaj1: 2NT was probably invitational; Tewary's hand with its nice club suit texture and length warrants a gameforce in my opinion|pg||
nt|guthi: you bet!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the trouble is there is no standard :)|pg||
nt|guthi: I play 14-16 when playing precision with my partner. it raises eyebrows everywhere here|pg||
nt|rvg: Uh oh!|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|mandala r: yes|pg||
nt|guthi: 3@S should be help suit. better than directly bidding 4.|pg||
mb|p|nt|guthi: Open room is faster, they are on board 36 already (they have already played 46-48)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Yes it need a minor lead to beat it|pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: must do the @c right|pg||
nt|guthi: and he does. white on red makes things easy |pg||

nt|dslee: you can talk to the organizers and CTD on the same, Ranju will make sure it works ur way mahesh|pg||
nt|othered1: south's hand is a very good minimum catch for north's auction.  Lack of @C duplication, especially|pg||

nt|jcwla: N/S in the OR have gotten to 6@H on Board 2 -- off two cashing aces (and with that lead-directing 5@C bid I mentioned made by Todi) it will be a big pickup for Sree Cement.|pg||

nt|bobholl: 4@H down on the (normal) @D finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: finally we have a comparison with open room, no swing|pg||
nt|guthi: does opening 1@d promise a 4crd M ? I came across such a style. Its there in DEMICOMA I think.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes thats the way we play it|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|guthi: how many @Hs in 3rd seat? :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzau: 1:)|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: Pour me a Bushmills pls|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Bergen raise no doubt|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4S|nt|kiwibridge: not a 1 opener, very misleading, and silly 3rd in hand|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Too early in the morning for me Sunil|pg||
pc|h2|nt|guthi: very conservative bidding, imo.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Not quite Bob, its not your fault that NS keep digging a bigger hole for themselves|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: late a'noon here and in Delhi where this final is taking place|pg||

nt|guthi: zoom zoom auction here. |pg||
nt|rvg: EW can make 5D/S but not sure if they will get there after a5C save|pg||

nt|vugraphzau: ian thinking|pg||
nt|bobholl: but they may gain a lot now :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|rvg: Important to get Spades into the auction hence the initial double - now they should be able to get to 5D but what if NS bid 5H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: lots of explantion going on|pg||
nt|bobholl: standard will get to 4@H|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mandala r: asking for 3-card h support?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|guthi: @H 8 will prove valuble for the declarer.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: are they on a break?|pg||
nt|guthi: Yep, standard 2@C opener, but after a likely 2@D overcall|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: maybe even 3@D|pg||
nt|guthi: South would Dbl to show his majors. a tad weak on values maybe.|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: waiting for north to bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: brb|pg||
nt|guthi: Open room is atleast 3 boards ahead :)|pg||
nt|guthi: good bidding at the other table. Playing standard East did well to keep the auction alive. |pg||
nt|guthi: Precision will do well on this board. |pg||
nt|vugraphzau: waiting for players..|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: south/east are not there |pg||
nt|guthi: may be not, North will find his @D ruff.|pg||

nt|bobholl: guess 4@h going down|pg||

mb|p|nt|guthi: We have some IMPs for Team Promila here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: On 34 where they bid and made 3NT EW here, they are playing in 1NT in Open - so first swing of the set|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|mandala r: yes correct road|pg||
nt|bobholl: if he can invite with 55 :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1st this segment yey|pg||
nt|guthi: routine 4@H for EW.|pg||

mb|2H|nt|dslee: passed hand this is not inverted|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nS out of danger now :)|pg||
nt|guthi: North at the other table gifted a trick on the lead - on board 18. |pg||

mb|p|nt|rvg: ok looks like they are bidding 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: sorry..by mistake i gave board 7 to the players|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|bobholl: this probably is weak with high colours|pg||
nt|sartaj1: There are some who still play 2@D as showing 10-11 with a diamond fit. Their idea is to ensure getting to the marginal game when partner has a balanced 14 count|pg||

nt|guthi: On this deal atleast.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzau: north thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|guthi: a gift on the lead. Makes things easier for the declarer.|pg||
nt|bobholl: but they will reach 4 @H now (their timing is bad)|pg||
nt|guthi: and North will lead a @S I guess|pg||
nt|bobholl: switching their choices on last 2 boards makes a lot of difference|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: south on lead|pg||
nt|guthi: :)|pg||
nt|guthi: 4@C must be splinter, agreeing @Hs as trumps.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i suppose with the big lead, both teams are taking it easy|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: not straining nerve and sinew, I mean|pg||

nt|vugraphzau: he|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: she is west...east he|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sartaj1: Perhaps this more on the "Swarnendu = dummy = good " principle :)|pg||
nt|rvg: this will probably get beaten - defense should get 1 spade , 1H, 2D, 1C but some care may be needed|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Well I would expect the trailing team to be pushing a bit harder rather than the leaders|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcwla: Board 3 a push at +110 N/S in @D's.|pg||
nt|sartaj1: After the takeout double of 2@D , declarer is probably worried about a 4-1 split. I'm predicting a spade next|pg||

nt|guthi: yes.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sartaj1: Risky line of play; If diamonds were 4-1, East could now return a trump and declarer is in control-trouble|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kiwibridge: and uppercut for pard|pg||
pc|d7|pc|cT|pg||
nt|bobholl: strange best way seems to ruff in E a @D|pg||
nt|guthi: since the contract is always safe if club finesse works, its not hard to see?|pg||
nt|bobholl: but with 52 cards in sigth things are always easier:)|pg||
nt|guthi: ;)|pg||
nt|guthi: Team Mango gained 7 on board 21, where in the Open room EW stopped in just 2@S! |pg||
nt|bobholl: but texan aces will gsin on next 2 boards :)|pg||

nt|mcarroll: @S game for NS?|pg||
nt|bobholl: on 22 Mango bid 4@S (phantom save)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rvg: No deal 1 the Mango defender tried an unusual lead of SA against 3N and that was not a success - he lost his only entry|pg||
nt|othered1: On this hand it would be nicer if 1@D were normal, not ambiguous. North's 1N is automatic, if within range|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: Not Mango It was Texan Aces|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The Aces are gaining imps on all boards so far this session |pg||

mb|3H|nt|othered1: east may well consider if west's primary suit is @C.  Here he found the good @H lead|pg||
nt|rvg: These low level contracts are fascinating to analyze |pg||
nt|rvg: here it looks like he can make 3N|pg||

pc|d9|nt|sartaj1: The 1NT advance to a overcall is fairly wide ranging; South could have had upto 11 or so points, so I like North's push towards game|pg||
nt|guthi: East has 11 red cards :) |pg||
nt|rvg: say by conceding a Club|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: again pard is bereft|pg||
nt|guthi: lets see if NS here can keep off the this slam|pg||

nt|rvg: I thought|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 nt NS no problem|pg||
mb|1D|nt|guthi: this irresistible slam.|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, I wouldn't like +90 at all at matchpoints, but here it's OK|pg||
mb|d|nt|sunsamvar: a sedate 2@S i presume|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sartaj1: Pass, Double or 2@C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: how much better to open a 15-18 NT and have pard transfer to @D|pg||
nt|othered1: sometimes 1@S in 3rd seat is more preemptive than 2.  And it's close here.|pg||
mb|d|nt|don paulus: 2 ih NS|pg||
nt|don paulus: @h|pg||
nt|rvg: On this hand 2S works out better|pg||
nt|rvg: Wonder what Ian will do over 3C now|pg||
nt|othered1: wonderif west was considering leaping Michaels (4@D to show red 2-suiter, usually stronger)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: would you open the north hand ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Double I don't like.  It's pass or 2@C.|pg||
nt|dslee: I am afraid, NS might go overboard in this now|pg||
nt|guthi: They should be parking in 3@D|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 2@D 2@H 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: unless they play equal level conversions onthis auction (simple 3@D rebid over 3@C), west wouldn't have had a decent bid over 3@C|pg||
nt|mcarroll: No!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kiwibridge: wrongsided|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and 2@D should be a transfer|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: not alerted 2@d|pg||
nt|guthi: yeah, it is wrongsided this time.|pg||
nt|rvg: One good convention is to play Leaping Michaels as a light takeout and direct cue as game in hand with minors or a much stronger Leaping Michaels|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sounds reasonable|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dslee: bang, thats it|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: north saying natural|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dslee: what is the lead @H :)? or @C:)?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: excellent, so another "variation" from standard :)|pg||
nt|guthi: hard to find people not playing transfers thesedays :)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|don paulus: probably +1|pg||
nt|jcwla: So it's 6 to Sree Cement for bidding and making the NT game on 5 - with an overtrick no less.|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: director call by ian|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all sits well makeing 3, not many swing boards this set...apart from an amusing board 30 coming up soon|pg||
nt|othered1: That's one alternative.  But at these colors, they can't be too light, even with north's being a passed hand.|pg||
nt|guthi: low @D looks best.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kiwibridge: feels the "natural 2@D should be alerted as NOT a trandfer!"|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|guthi: Another forcing/non forcing 2H. |pg||
nt|rvg: Yes, preempts are always a problem :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Otherwise, I agree with you, if you don't want the direct cue bid to ask for a stopper in their suit.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobholl: what would you lead as w @C K ?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yep|pg||
pc|sA|nt|guthi: after North bid 2@c? :) |pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzau: n/s playing precision|pg||
nt|guthi: that explains the auction. |pg||
nt|guthi: even playing std, the opening would be 1@D. So it was evident.|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: south thinking|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|nt|othered1: Fact is, preempts work and do eat up valuable space.|pg||
nt|rvg: On this hand 5C would probably make on a Spade lead|pg||
pc|d3|nt|guthi: lack of complicated slam bidding gadgets make it difficult to bid this.|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: north denied @s cue|pg||
nt|guthi: but precision of CCWei offers good many gadets to check for controls., that would mean South should check controls in all the three suits. |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|sartaj1: It was crucial to switch to hearts in time, else the diamonds provide enough discards; well done|pg||

nt|rvg: Wonder what the other room will do - will Ian overcall 3H? unlikely that that hand would pass over 2S I think|pg||
nt|othered1: It's tough.  I'd bit the bullet and try 3@h, especially with north as passed hand.|pg||
nt|rvg: If he ovecalls 3H the bidding will probably go 3S by North, a responsive double by East (?) and they will probably|pg||
nt|rvg: land in 4H which North should double|pg||
nt|othered1: If west overcalls 3@H, east's next action isn't trivial, either.|pg||
nt|rvg: He has a reasonable expectation of beating 5D I think :)|pg||
nt|rvg: there are no comments from the kibitzers - a surprisingly silent community|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe, playing Precision, where partner can open even at these colors on light hands, west should rethink taking any aggresive action, but that can go double figures of imps wrong.|pg||
nt|rvg: Yes - these days nobody likes to miss games that have a 10% chance of success :)|pg||
nt|othered1: But there are lots of hands where east would sell to 2@S on which you make 4@H, a huge swing even if you beat 2@S.|pg||
nt|rvg: On board 7 Shridhar passed partner's 2S overcall and that turned out to be  a great winning decision|pg||
nt|rvg: you will recall that EW bid 3N going down here - at a certain point of time declarer could have made it after a defensive slip|pg||
nt|othered1: Not sure I'd find that.  Knowing partner's style in a tight partnership influences decisions.|pg||
nt|rvg: well Shridhar and Tewari are not a regular partnership - but I agree - passing is not the easiest of bids to make in that situation - partner makes a vulnerable 2S overcall and you ...|pg||
nt|rvg: have xx, AXX, QTxxxx, KJ|pg||

nt|guthi: because South will force declarer to ruff in dummy? |pg||
nt|guthi: That was ugly for NS, -800! |pg||
mb|2D|nt|bobholl: 1 nt in any direction down ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rvg: I mean what is Tewari lovingly called at home ? He has no pet AFAIK :)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|guthi: I see seven tricks top.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: dbl is -7|pg||

mb|2N|nt|kiwibridge: S passes!|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes sry miscounted ?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3S|mb|4C|nt|othered1: missing 2 key cards plus the trump Q makes it look like something unexpected happened in the auction|pg||
nt|rvg: Wonder how they got here!|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 4@C certainly a big bid.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: surprising - may not get another chance |pg||
nt|vugraphzau: brb|pg||
nt|bobholl: they count better than me :)|pg||
nt|guthi: ;)|pg||

nt|mcarroll: I agree|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mcarroll: I am getting the same reaction from kibs|pg||
mb|p|nt|sartaj1: I think 4@C is the mainstream choice...even though it does not work out well on this hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: BIG view by Ian a trick short I expect|pg||
mb|6C|nt|mdgraham: South will have to make five rather nasty discards |pg||
nt|vugraphzau: Ian thinking|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he can see 8 tricks|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: shows he thought too long :(|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 5@C wd have been a great contract|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Cohen's LAW working here with 10 tricks in @S and 11 in @C|pg||
nt|guthi: South Sould bid spades at some point. Unless his 2NT showed a raise.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|don paulus: S hoping for another @d :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||

nt|guthi: Yes, well bid.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c4|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|sartaj1: I guess a reasonable alternative is to double intending to raise partner's 3M response to game and to bid 3@H over 3@D|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: that 4@S bid was the key|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|sartaj1: hmm....maybe is better than my "mainstream" comment :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Board 7 - where N/S here got all the way up to 3@D making four, in the OR the N/S played 1NT making three.  1 more IMP to Texan Aces.|pg||
nt|guthi: This will be more imps to Team Promila.|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||

pc|s6|pc|dA|nt|guthi: only -1. |pg||
nt|guthi: interestingly, even the other room was in 5D on board 40, undoubled, and only -1! |pg||

nt|othered1: Maybe south opened 11C, west got @S in maybe at 2-level, then things just rolled along|pg||
nt|rvg: My guess is they had an RKC accident - players play different RKC responses if Clubs are trumps and maybe thats what happened|pg||
nt|rvg: My friend Dhakras who is kibitzing has many interesting stories based on this :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: maybe south shd have taken away bidding space by bidding some amt of @s at his turn|pg||

mb|3C!|nt|jcwla: Eddie Kantar believes one should have three cards in the other major to open 1NT with a five-card major.|pg||

nt|mcarroll: This is going to be ugly|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but South expects 6@C to go down Martin|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzau: yes the bidding was strange and the contract|pg||
nt|guthi: This must be a invitational hand with clubs with East.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: never was a fan of the "traditional" 2@C opening|pg||
nt|guthi: declarer will run with his 8 tricks. |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: mango score a big 9 on the innocuous 2@D hand in what looks like a Cappeletti disaster :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|guthi: Other table may not open 1NT with this 5422. |pg||
nt|mcarroll: True Sunil|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: still, maybe there are systemic constraints on 1@D|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Ok Ugly but not the type I was expecting|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: decl thinking|pg||
nt|guthi: the modern style is to play it as promising 6 cards in 1&2nd seats. |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|guthi: ofcourse he doesn't want to depend on @Ds breaking 3-3|pg||

pc|d8|nt|mandala r: i think some misundersting not expected|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcwla: On Board 8, the OR N/S bid the NT game (whereas N/S here stopped in 2NT) and made it for 6 to Texan Aces.|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|jcwla: And so it is.|pg||

mb|2D|nt|mandala r: w should|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: South will be relieved to see 2@S on the bidding tray.|pg||
nt|othered1: Most systems, whatever 1@C means, should get to 4@H.  5 cold be too many|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will they reach the @D slam here ?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|don paulus: 3 @c opening not attractive 1st hand|pg||
nt|mandala r: board position is fav|pg||
nt|don paulus: y - may bring P in probl if good hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with 9-6 from 7 scored it's tight stuff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in my university days boards with only a single figure swing were regarded as flat|pg||
nt|guthi: East can double again|pg||
nt|rvg: but nature is forgiving - I thonk bridge is a lot like that - a very small number of mistakes actually get punished :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mandala r: of course 4-card h is a deterent|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@D semipositive?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|don paulus: wonder how bidding went in open room - ending up in 4 @h ?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not the best shape for a takeout double, but certainly the points are in the right places.|pg||
nt|guthi: ah, one step higher. |pg||
mb|p|nt|guthi: South chose to pass in the other room after the same start|pg||
nt|guthi: 2NT here should show higher  point range than a direct 3NT. |pg||
mb|3C|nt|mandala r: yes strange this should go down|pg||
nt|guthi: its best to bid immediately imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: sounds fair Mike|pg||
nt|guthi: this is lot of bidding by East. |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: finesse and trump break... about 33% i guess|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jcwla: Interesting that East never peeped.|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: here S doesn't even sqeak|pg||
nt|guthi: Ah! south chooses to pass! no fireworks.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm|pg||
nt|guthi: Thanks for the link Mike.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes great thx Mike|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: south asking west about his 3@d 3rd seat call|pg||
nt|othered1: Did you notice that on board 10, where NS here found slam off an ace and the KQ of trumps, they picked up 5 imps for their -100?  Other room down a bunch in 3N.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzau: west opened 1@h on board 22...9pts 6 carder @h|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it was a good bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rvg: ok back did you miss me :)|pg||
nt|guthi: 1NT showing minors I suppose.|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: yes thats what happened|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|don paulus: looks like this will make|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes I remember|pg||
pc|c4|nt|guthi: good stop by NS, I had a feeling that they will bid more. |pg||
pc|c3|nt|othered1: nice start for declarer,who still has work cut out to find 9 tricks.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: most people dont play penalty dbls on strong nt|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so i guess west is stuck for a bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: sorry missed the play|pg||
nt|guthi: Stuck for lack of systems I suppose,|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I would probably have bid the same as W, having a strong NT over a StrongNT is a problem, there are IMO better uses for a Double, but it means with this type of hand you are stuck|pg||
mc|5|nt|guthi: some imps exchaged now, end of this board Mango should be back in lead.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: actually 5@D looks pretty cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: sree cement trail 21 against texan aces...other semi/final|pg||
nt|guthi: lose 2@Cs and a @H, no?|pg||
nt|othered1: See result on board 10|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Enjoy the day.|pg||
nt|guthi: claim for 11 imps. |pg||
nt|guthi: only 2 more boards here. TexanAces gained a further 21 imps in this segment so far. |pg||
mb|1C|nt|kiwibridge: must leave you now for the youth, thanks all|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: 2 more boards |pg||
nt|guthi: Bye Mike.|pg||
nt|bobholl: NS should show some restriction on this hand 1@S 1NT all pass for example :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|guthi: a brave 2@D (tranfer to @H after a 1NT opening) in the other room, at this vul.|pg||
nt|rvg: SOmeone said that he misplayed 3N but I am not sure of that - he did not have two entries to dummy to take a Club double finesse AFAICR|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@C is good enough but not automatic to bid.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rvg: I was referring to board 10 in other room|pg||
nt|bobholl: ok 1@S 1nt 2@C 2@D 2@S|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5D|nt|guthi: needs to guess the club position correctly to make.|pg||
mb|p|nt|guthi: They will likely stop in 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: 5@S good sacrifice|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: 101 the lead:)|pg||
mb|5S|nt|guthi: 2@H must be general good hand, yes, it is.|pg||
nt|othered1: That was short and ineffective.|pg||
nt|guthi: Are they playing Bart?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: looks so :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|guthi: NS are 1 step too high. |pg||
pc|dK|nt|rvg: But as Ed pointed out, declarer on board 10 could have held up the SA at trick 1|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bobholl: they are not listening to me (the bastards)|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: they will be punished properly i guess :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 5@D i mean|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcwla: On 10, where N/S here played 4@H after 3@C-4@C, the OR N began with a double and N/S ended in 3NT-1.  3 more to Texan Aces.|pg||
nt|bobholl: -3 looks a lot (bad guessing)|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: this sort of comments are abuse  on BBO|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: bobholl we shall report u and we will|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't know what they are waiting for :)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|guthi: West can play the Ten to tempt south to play the Jack. |pg||
nt|guthi: east must exercise caution here. |pg||
nt|panja: brilliant shift..isn't it?|pg||
