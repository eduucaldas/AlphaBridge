mb|5H|mb|p|nt|royhughes: Hello to Marshall Lewis of the US|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: hi all.    there would be some difference of expert opinion about whether pass by N now is forcing. perhaps not wanting to take the chance N bids 5H. In any case, though, S would ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bid it if N passed|pg||
nt|royhughes: As Marshall points out, this hand seems to revolve around building a 2nd spade trick before resorting to the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|royhughes: If declarer goes after diamonds the defenders will surely switch to spades and build their trick there|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is an alternative winning line but it is a bit double dummy--eliminates the side suits and lead a D to the Q and ace|pg||

nt|royhughes: Zmuda seems to be on the right path|pg||
nt|royhughes: But declarer may face a nasty guess in spades|pg||
nt|royhughes: On a spade return, declarer has to guess whether to try to drop the remaining honour or finesse West for it|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: on this layout, EW cannot profitably mislead declarer about the location of the three missing spade honors---since N has possibilities in diamonds as a fallback plan, he is going ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to ruff the third spade (after small to the ten and jack) and drop the honors. if instead E splits, N will work out the position because E did not lead a spade|pg||

nt|royhughes: That's the common treatment|pg||
nt|royhughes: I like natural slam tries|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|royhughes: 3@h must have been forcing -- it may have been wide-range|pg||
nt|royhughes: This sometimes creates problems for 2/1 partnerships|pg||
nt|marlowepi: by that logic, cindy, 1S - 2N (Jacoby) - 3X or 4X should be a cue, but most people don't play them that way.|pg||
nt|cindy:  not using fast arrival|pg||
nt|cindy:  3@h is stronger than 4@h|pg||

nt|marlowepi: unless we know what the alerts were, our comments here are highly speculative at best|pg||
