nt|jcwla: 2@S-X-3@S-4@H perhaps, nope.|pg||

mb|5H|nt|jaapfr: 5@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this looks like some kind of "club system" response |pg||
nt|bigtrain: x is (not surprisingly) Meckwell, showing one minor OR both majors OR some good hand|pg||
nt|peachy: i think a bit rich for 3rd seat weak two|pg||
nt|roswolf: now 4@H is frisky|pg||
nt|shevek: south didn't bid in OR so west did end up in 3N (previous hand)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: South could double here to show the higher end of the 1NT with weak/short @D's.|pg||
mb|5S|nt|haans: hgeelen has cc: www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/.../molenaar-verbeek.pdf |pg||
nt|cherdano:  with 4-4 in the majors, i would certainly double|pg||

nt|haans: agree with u there|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|haans: but only 1 down :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: south's bid helped west to find the 3N bid |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Now that East passed 5@H, West will take another bid|pg||
mb|6H|nt|jcwla: 2 is in from OR: 12 more to Neth. Orange for bidding and making 4@H doubled.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: But it won't be 1660 as one might have feared|pg||

mb|p|nt|jaapfr: another 8 imps for Polish i presume|pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: i think 1@D is the normal transfer today|pg||
nt|lestergold: diamond barrage has not kept them out of the sensib le contract of 5c|pg||
nt|onebid: I think Liz was right - too much by NS|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks like it :(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but 5@S does make|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think 6@S makes.|pg||
nt|onebid: I do too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I must say that it's tempting to bid again over 4@S with Wilkinson's cards. NV and 5@H will not be expensive if they are allowed to play there|pg||

pc|s7|nt|sybarra: probably right Hans |pg||
pc|h2|pg||

nt|onebid: but maybe give up after 5@S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Why would he fear that E-W can make slam after a 1-level overcall|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cuttysark: Same Auction the Polish South bid 5@D, which seemed to work better|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: did see the dummy did see it|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence could set up a diamond or spade trick to go with the ace of hearts but not both|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: 5cv of course is safe on a 4/2 heart break whereas 4h might have been shaky on such a break|pg||

nt|Walddk4: You play Precision, Liz, please explain 1NT. Did the reverse 1@S and 1NT?|pg||
nt|onebid: Oh dear - I guess I can;'t comment on my choice of opening. Roland still here? lol|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jcwla: 3 is in from the OR: 5 more to Neth. Orange after 2@S-P-3@S-swish, making.   E/W never peeped.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: here 2NT by E shows 18+|pg||
nt|cherdano:  now he can count 13 tricks|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: The F-word is still disallowed, Judy :)|pg||

nt|onebid: OK:(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: duck and give 2@H to make|pg||
nt|onebid: Not responding 1@S caused the lead to come from East|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 1@H looks fine to me but I fear they may have wrongsided this|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lucky W aint have 3@D|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North must duck and hope he has been a good boy|pg||
nt|onebid: suits up the line sometimes better|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if so it would be always down after this lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i mean the 3@D|pg||
nt|onebid: still, no choice but to duck|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true|pg||
nt|paulg: They don't play "F" and they don't reverse 1@s/1NT, but often start game forcing hands with a forcing 1NT rather than bid naturally .. for some reason|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The trouble is that he might rely on the club finesse to work in order to get rid of a diamond loser. So there is a losing option|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: bidding games on everything is not good bridge|pg||
nt|cherdano:  _she_ can count 13 tricks|pg||

nt|jcwla: WD.|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has only one lay for this contract and he will no doubt roll it in with a PHEW because if tehn diamonds dont behave the contract is going down loads|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or he may try to duck hearts into East to protect @DJ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or not :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: His decision is brilliant|pg||
nt|onebid: Hi Paul@H|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think he will take Roland line|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|haans: norwegan GF 2nt|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: USA Blue in a league of their own it seems|pg||

nt|shevek: easy 4@h or 4@s here, probably another square board|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I don't see 9 tricks - not that I'm complaining, you understand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk4: He had them in the end. Diamond up after drawing trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 42 are very young |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Jacob and Hans |pg||
nt|cherdano:  another automatic opener for NS|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this hand may be stretching light openings too far|pg||
nt|cherdano:  playing a strong club i don't see any problems with opening balanced 10 counts|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S is soon slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4s is not quite as easy|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: we now have the rooms connected :)  wd |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 club?|pg||
nt|cherdano:  3@C probably shows both minors|pg||
nt|buffytvs: when the suit you open is dbleton KJ? an aceless 8-loser wonder?|pg||
nt|cherdano:  getting to 3N looks more normal|pg||
nt|shevek: true|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tell me how you find 11 tricks here:)|pg||
nt|onebid: for heart pitch|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|haans: its the first day in school|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I was searching, but in vain|pg||
mb|p|nt|onebid: it's 11 hcp and 1@D doesn't guarantee diamonds|pg||
nt|cherdano:  well it doesnt show diamonds, it shows a balanced 10-13|pg||
nt|haans: well done here|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: in my book 4@C is cue |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: got that right|pg||
nt|cherdano:  here the opening propel EW too high|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no, I think EW did that to themselves|pg||
nt|cherdano:  of course, it would have been NW who are too high if East had made a penalty pass|pg||
nt|cherdano:  but with KQx of trumps, that wasnt so easy to find|pg||
nt|buffytvs: wasn't 3@C a diamond raise?|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i _think_ it shows both minors|pg||
nt|harmon: probably fit showing cause Justin always throws fits anyway|pg||
nt|cherdano:  Matt Meckstroth confirms, 3@C shows both minors, less than invite|pg||
nt|lestergold: can lose two spade tricks a heart and a diamond in 4s whereas no probs in 4H|pg||
nt|shevek: declarer would have to guess @s|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think 3@C is 5-card Stayman|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Is 3@C a modern variation of Stayman?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cherdano:  successful lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: i wouls bid 4@S as north and pard would pass !|pg||
nt|onebid: puppet likely|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Liz answered the question|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i see a @C a@D and a @H as minimum for defense here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well, there goes the club?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|cherdano:  if declarer ducks to West's king, West can shift to the @CT|pg||
nt|lestergold: however it lookslike they will p-lay this in the sounder 4/4 fit rather than the 6/2 fit|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rnmalik: good pass by N-makeable +1|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @CA and another|pg||
nt|haans: not right if clubs 3-1|pg||
nt|harmon: Meckstroth?? that name sounds familiar|pg||
nt|jcwla: 5 to Scotland on Board 5.  They went down 1 in 2NT here while Neth. went down 3 in 3NT in the OR.|pg||
nt|onebid: at least he didn't lead doubleton diamond:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cherdano:  true Harmon :)|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|lestergold: spec says nht losers can go on clubs in 4s not if club switchcut declarer off from dummy tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: my|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cherdano:  this seems down 3 now|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S may be big winner|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: little break here|pg||
nt|haans: how many of you had ever bid 4@C after 3@S because you want to play clubs? not many im sure|pg||
nt|haans: also a place for asking bids|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|cherdano:  here declarer could have blocked the suit by ducking @C9|pg||
pc|d5|nt|haans: still a make|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i suppose West meant redouble as SOS, or doubt-showing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I hope you guys are never dealt doubletons|pg||
nt|Walddk4: do you always have 4333?|pg||
nt|onebid: Liz and I won't lead'em|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Fortunately we cannot have four doubletons|pg||
nt|onebid: LOLOL|pg||
nt|jaapfr: girls or guys:)?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|shevek: at the other table declarer played @hA, then small to Q which is the correct play to lose 1 trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer has much to worry about here he doesnt know hts and clubs ar behaving so well|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: she is still thinking|pg||

pc|c3|nt|yvonnebrid: yes, it is marion|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cherdano:  West did well to keep the club layout unclare with the @C9 continuation|pg||
nt|lestergold: marion will be disappointed with that finesse another diamond is quite a threatening defence|pg||
pc|cA|nt|harmon: he wanted to get to the 4 level??|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|cherdano:  the @H shift destroyed NS' communication|pg||
nt|buffytvs: East probably had doubts too, but nowhere to run either|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s2|nt|lestergold: when all tgye side suits are finished often best to give ruff and discard to weaken trump position|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it happens i dont think a sledgehammer  would beat this|pg||
nt|shevek: if she thinks cross ruff, then she'd have to cash @cQ 1st anyway..|pg||

nt|peachy: particularly opposing Precision players|pg||
nt|peachy: 4H could have been many types of hands|pg||
nt|roswolf: it should be a relay cue in that you ask opener to cue bid singletons or voids and is forcing to 5 of the trump suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The closed room result now is a score you should never see at IMPs, but you do, sadly|pg||
nt|onebid: action!|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|jcwla: Better @C play by Lall in other room but chose to work on @H's rather than @S's and ended up the same down two for another push.|pg||

nt|onebid: West had awkward decision over 2@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cherdano:  1@C = 16+|pg||

nt|cuttysark: The old weak 2-suited two opener does not seem to have reached Junior Scotland yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  1@H = 8-11 |pg||
nt|onebid: Perhaps should have opened the bidding?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: double is very dangerous. I would have preferred 2NT, two places to play, if I re-open|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still as E after p-2@S-p-p-X-p-?? what to do then Roland??|pg||
pc|cT|nt|cherdano:  (i assume)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Read above|pg||

nt|ritong: they stayed backline all set long|pg||
nt|jaapfr: agree but when pd X as E i do pass as well|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|cuttysark: I also agree that the double is not good - spade void makes it likely partner will pass|pg||

nt|cherdano:  West can show his hand completely|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|haans: often invite to game in spades|pg||
nt|onebid: you certainly will pass|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|cherdano:  West opts for a stopperless 1N bid|pg||

nt|cherdano:  rather than 2@H with a flat hand and a 4-3 fit|pg||

nt|cherdano:  knowing they are limited to 32 hcp, West doesn't try for grand - will be disappointed to find perfect cards with East|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6 a push at 3NT-2.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: but the have a lot to do|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jcwla: Same contract in OR -- hard to find out about the 5 @D tricks -- yet another push.|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|lml: this seems like an overly cheerful auction|pg||
nt|buffytvs: exuberant I would say|pg||
nt|cherdano:  2N by East would have been enough|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think once West responded East was never letting him out|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i guess some would suggest that West should pass with 5 hcp, but since I know I would bid 1@H i won't criticize him for bidding :)|pg||
nt|lml: well 2NT is the book bid|pg||
nt|lml: yes he has aces but he is 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|lml: +1 and -1|pg||
nt|cuttysark: At least North did not lead his 10x|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Well, there is no damage control when you have to match 470|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|cherdano:  4333 and 3 jacks|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|haans: cross ruff|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rnmalik: @C shif would have created some problems|pg||

pc|c6|nt|lml: but then add a point or two for youth|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho 3n did go off in open room- its not an unreasonable contract to reach combined 24 with two 5 card suits and fair inmtermedoates all suits stopped|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And it is hard to see a good defence to this heart contract|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|haans: @H lead to J and then after entry with @SK kill |pg||

nt|jaapfr: polish=muiderberg in this respect tx paul:)|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|buffytvs: scoring average has gone down -- only 8 IMPs per board now|pg||

pc|d5|nt|lml: @CK and @HK|pg||

nt|cherdano:  still West can confirm keycards|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|haans: with that weak hand?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think Verbeek is looking for some action here  |pg||
nt|bigtrain: normal precision it's easier...  E makes a @D positive then W can visualize grand|pg||
nt|cherdano:  confirm having all keycards, and sometimes East can just bid 7 on a spade or club trick source|pg||
nt|cherdano:  2@D showing a good heart raise|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some play that bidding 6 says a keycard is missing.|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s need to play this in 3N north may worry about diamonds but probably best just to punt it|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|sybarra: or maybe it is just a 5 card (very) wk 2 |pg||

nt|shevek: 3@s by south?|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u if 3n means i havent got spades but have got diamodns then all will be ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5c can make of course as cards lie|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 3n much more comfortable|pg||
nt|shevek: obviously north failed to bid 3NT because he thinks slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: the ten of dimaonds is the key card and its favourable|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|rnmalik: do you agree to such opening when P is not a passed hand|pg||
nt|cherdano:  so 2@D promised 3 hearts and 8+ points to be precise|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it depends on the meaning of the 3c raise- in modern stykle its unusually weakish|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: wimpy pass|pg||

nt|cindy:  that is really sticking your neck out|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cindy:  amazing.  partner sticks his neck out on the chopping block red and W doesnt raise|pg||
nt|ritong: now that s exciting|pg||
nt|nicksan: North's 1 @D is negative, or semi-negative...3 NT is optmistic...but will East know?|pg||

nt|haans: professional |pg||
nt|sybarra: thanks to our operator in Turkey,   great job! |pg||
nt|vugraphzur: this is last board of the day 4th RR will start 10 am local time tommorow |pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: another slam?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Hans and Rashed for comments and insights,  we appreciate your time |pg||
nt|lml: the dreaded multi|pg||
nt|jcwla: As we approach the end of this match, a big thank you to our excellent vugraph operator, to Roland Wald, to Walter Johnson, to Arend Bayer, and to all specs.|pg||
nt|onebid: now there's a result!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last board of the match now. Many thanks again to Ozgur Kanli, our very capable operator in Istanbul. Well done!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: what a lucky  3nt with 6 tricks for defense\|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Also thanks to my excellent fellow commentators: Liz McGowan, Judy Bramley and Jaap Frijling|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we have had 3 I think in this session|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also to the organizers for bringing us the Youth Congress,   we will be busy on bbo for many days |pg||
nt|vugraphzur: see you @@ 16:00 o'clock at local time 35 minutes later|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks Shirley, Haans and our operator. It ia a pleasure.|pg||
nt|lml: when I was playing a few days ago at a tournament in North American I practically got booed for playing it|pg||
nt|peachy: this will be another likely push at 3n|pg||
nt|lestergold: we see that e/w in open reached a very junior 3N|pg||
nt|lestergold: absurd really because the spade lead was guaranteed|pg||
nt|shevek: well, it worked in bd 24 :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2d is atrociopus|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: this is the last board of this round RR7 will start about half hour later|pg||
nt|shevek: they're young Mike|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Finally, our appreciation to the WBF and TBF for ensuring that this wonderful inaugural event is brought to BBO vugraph. Murat Molva, Ata Aydin and Cengiz Arigun have been ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: instrumental in setting up a fine show for the whole world to watch. Much appreciated!|pg||
nt|onebid: and also thanks to Paul for giving us info on system|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: a weak 2 with two ks outside but nothing in ur suit is not my idea of sound bridge especially in second piosition|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: ur bids should always be sound in 2nd of course|pg||
nt|shevek: born after 1 January 1984 (Under-26 category)|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: the last round of the day will start in 45 mins later|pg||
nt|paulg: I'm not sure I'd give a positive on that club suit|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: I am sorry,  I must dash to an appointment,  I will see you later :)  |pg||
mb|3D!|nt|sybarra: n/s are young but have played internationlly for some time |pg||
nt|sybarra: S on the NL ladies team |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: slam here is to much|pg||
nt|haans: trust no spade lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Thank you everybody - enjoy the rest of this event|pg||
nt|jaapfr: all kibs rite about x @H lead making 3nt by N and the potential blocking|pg||
nt|onebid: Indeed, and good group here. Thanks|pg||
mb|4D|nt|cherdano:  now this time East is taking the aggressive route!|pg||
nt|lml: it is allowed in unlimited events at major tournaments if there are at least 6 boards per round|pg||
nt|cherdano:  and to you, Jordan|pg||
nt|shevek: looks like 5 imps to Greecoura to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: even then but no @C finesse|pg||
nt|haans: easy make if you see all cards|pg||
nt|rnmalik: again:)|pg||
nt|haans: smirny say 'its cold sp on D' na dright that is|pg||
nt|cherdano:  3@D shows spades, probably with a maximum|pg||
nt|lml: I was told I played it to confuse the opponents who would find it sooo hard to play against|pg||
nt|onebid: no longer matters:(|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The heart suit could easily be blocked against 3NT, but what does it matter when West has a trick in spades|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and what would we do with E in other room when he would lead @HAK2:)?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I agree that North should bid 1NT (or possibly 1@S if they are reversing things)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Excellent case for 3rd leads|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @H6 lead would unblock the suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Someone has asked me to explain the bidding. Would that I could|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It's a strong club, positive response, then it loses me a little|pg||
nt|onebid: seems that N thought 3@D was natural and South is cue bidding|pg||
nt|jaapfr: most of the 10 boards the Scotch were ""ünhappy"" imo|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So popular opinion has it that 3@C is a trump ask, 3@D denies a top honour|pg||
nt|paulg: 3@c is trump asking, 3@d says I have rubbish trumps, 4@d is cue|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In theory, the Scots are doing the right thing here, avoiding 3NT. The trouble is that no other game makes either|pg||
nt|onebid: Ah - Thx Paul|pg||
nt|paulg: as North is unlimited at this point|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not wishing to cause trouble, but we are Scots (Scotch is whisky)|pg||
nt|paulg: North will be looking for a forcing 3@c bid in the box now|pg||
nt|onebid: and very good whiskey:)|pg||
nt|onebid: But Paul, why would S need to ask about club quality?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a kib does not forgive W in other room for not bidding 3@H:)|pg||
nt|paulg: because they play a very simple system and it is how they show support|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|haans: and right that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: director warned the players last 2 min|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep double swing here|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, Marion is an experienced player|pg||
nt|ritong: was a weird decision, admittedly|pg||
mb|5C|nt|cherdano:  evil Linda, evil!|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  :)|pg||
nt|shevek: but maybe you should change your tactics when you play in a youth field?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Well, as we approach the end of this match, a big thank you to Roland Wald, to our excellent vugraph operator, to Raija Davis and to all specs.  Coverage continues throughout the ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: day here on BBO.|pg||
nt|sybarra: one of the young pair on the dutch ladies team |pg||
nt|ritong: told you, they stood backline all set long|pg||
nt|onebid: I apologize for mis-spelling whisky:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: i guess 4@d may be keycard, looking at the 4@s bid|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: even though I provided a choice of two written defenses they could read at the table|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Could be Kickback. North has o keycards - took him a while to count them|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now lead @SA and continue @S pls lol|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rnmalik: asking for the @CQ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lml: during the auction|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|rnmalik: top 2 honours.|pg||
nt|shevek: we've seen, they like to bid a lot|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|hJ|nt|harmon: they couldnt read your writing|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|onebid: suit pref|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Nice jack, just in case|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cherdano:  south of course has to ruff in low|pg||
nt|lestergold: but she needs to reconsider position before opening prempts in second piosition the odds increase hat your partne rhas a good hand nad that it may be ur hand so there is more to ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: lose by making an unsound bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting thought Nicoletta |pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|cherdano:  HedyG tells me usually in france, 3@D shows a minimum with spades|pg||
nt|cherdano:  if so, East would have been extremely aggressive|pg||
nt|lml: I play the same way|pg||
nt|lml: 3!M shows a good hand with that M|pg||
nt|cherdano:  note the @HT here, in case declarer has @HA9x|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|cherdano:  defense needs to force declarer|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: hi shirley where did u appear from?!?|pg||

nt|cherdano:  South should get extra style points for that :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|buffytvs: thx all -- next set is in 1 hour|pg||
nt|cherdano:  so we might end with two more swings to USA blue|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: todays last qualification round will start in 45 mins|pg||
