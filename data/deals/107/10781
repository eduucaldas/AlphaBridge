mc|11|nt|Walddk2: Rhodes is a Greek island approximately 18 kilometres (11 miles) southwest of Turkey in eastern Aegean Sea. It is the largest of the Dodecanese islands in terms of both land area ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and population|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Historically, Rhodes was famous worldwide for the Colossus of Rhodes, one of the Seven Wonders of the World|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As far as bridge is concerned, Rhodes was the venue for the 1996 Olympics|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Waiting is part of a Pairs game|pg||

nt|athene: the problem with these bids is when responder has a good hand|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: you have to make maximum use of the room |pg||

nt|athene: a trump back would have worked better, allowing west to play three rounds|pg||
nt|athene: but it looked natural to go for the promotion in spades|pg||
nt|stc: W should better discrd the j@c|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: west was one-card squeezed|pg||
nt|athene: if he throws the club, declarer can draw trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @H5 is a nice uppercut but Nunes will score a heart trick en passant|pg||
nt|santyclz: Now he scores the @h10 en passant.|pg||
mc|9|nt|ritong: i hear some french? hello everyone|pg||
nt|athene: it's quite a common dilemma for a defender|pg||
nt|athene: when declarer is crossruffing|pg||
nt|athene: do you throw a card away so you can over-ruff?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Salut Henri.|pg||
nt|athene: if you have to throw a master card, declarer can sometimes change track and just draw trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi H|pg||
nt|stc: 9 NT tricks by N on a normal Â¨s lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: "En passant" is one of my two words of French.  The other being of course "troissansatout".|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: the NS auction looks natural but there are hidden undertones - 1@D is forcing and usually 14+ hcp|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: 1@D  14+ hcp, 4+ cards, forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so responder can be a lot more aggressive with nines and tens|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 9-hcp and 10-hcp hands i mean, not good spot cards :) although he has those too|pg||

pc|s5|nt|ritong: 12 available now|pg||

nt|athene: but i am not sure you take that line|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||

nt|athene: we'll see some of that next month :)|pg||
nt|ritong: since they open 1 NT any hand as we said earlier, presumably 1 NT rebid shows a good hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: Would you really balance at the 3 level, Henri, when they haven't shown any real fit?|pg||
nt|ritong: of course i would bid 2 NT|pg||
nt|athene: i think west can double 1nt if it's t/o|pg||
nt|ritong: plus, claudio huddled|pg||
nt|athene: safer to get in there earlier|pg||
nt|athene: sorry of course it has to be t/o of majors since he has a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: he can't possibly have a big hand with a trap of hearts|pg||
nt|ritong: i mean, the fact that south has a problem indicates a fit|pg||
nt|athene: even if you play that in other situations (which you shouldn't) :)|pg||
nt|ritong: when a good player has no fit, he passes instantly|pg||
nt|ritong: after having shown balanced hand, that is|pg||
nt|reisig: His problem might be finding his car keys|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps, then, west was worried that balancing might allow NS to wake up and bid and make 4@S|pg||

nt|athene: the hearts have the points, but the spades have...well they have the spades :)|pg||
nt|ritong: will the underdog make it?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|santyclz: In my dream system, a jump-shift is either a fit jump or a tradition strong jump-shift (to be differenciated later).|pg||

nt|santyclz: (traditional)|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: of course, sometimes you differentiate them in the post-mortem when partner passes|pg||

mc|10|nt|ritong: so we made it the hard way, right?|pg||
nt|athene: most would say that west hand was way too good for 2nt|pg||
nt|athene: i bet if you put it through that K&R thingie it would start dribbling and open 2@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: I would be among them, but it did keep out the @s overcall|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: hearts can't outbid spades, but notrumps can :)|pg||

nt|santyclz: 23.25 on k&r.|pg||
