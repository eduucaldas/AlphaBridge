pc|cJ|nt|benjent: Interesting position for North - attack diamonds to hopefully take away the entry to the cashing suit, or play trumps to reduce ruffs, or ....|pg||

nt|benjent: Hmmm. Hard to see how the @s return could work. A @d switch might have been enough (give partner KJ)|pg||
nt|petergill: Finding 8 card major fits is much more important at matchpoint scoring where 620 wins over 600, than at IMPs where 3NT is often the safest spot. |pg||
nt|petergill: North did not know that declarer had any spades, i.e. spades might not be running. |pg||

nt|jcwla: A partscore-induced defense there, perhaps.|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may be frisky|pg||
nt|shevek: south|pg||
nt|lestergold: abd we see in op-en room tghe much sounder 3n was played what a swing!|pg||
nt|shevek: west was concerned about missing a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i think we will see some bidding here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|buffytvs: the nice thing about Juniors is that they play very quickly :-)|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|haans: now we know NS do not play bid club|pg||
nt|rnmalik: part score|pg||
nt|cherdano:  Double probably shows one minor or both majors|pg||
nt|jcwla: Neth. is playing 6@D on 22 -- Lall has gotten off to the best lead of the @SK.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2@S-X-3@S-4@H perhaps, nope.|pg||
nt|lestergold: previous han 4/333 hand not an exciting looking slam prospect and not so strong|pg||
mb|2H|mb|4D|nt|haans: specs say thijs and lotte (=NS)  play much less 'adventurous' than most juniors|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s can mak 5c 4h |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this looks like some kind of "club system" response |pg||
nt|bigtrain: x is (not surprisingly) Meckwell, showing one minor OR both majors OR some good hand|pg||
nt|peachy: i think a bit rich for 3rd seat weak two|pg||
nt|roswolf: now 4@H is frisky|pg||
nt|shevek: south didn't bid in OR so west did end up in 3N (previous hand)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jcwla: South could double here to show the higher end of the 1NT with weak/short @D's.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: hgeelen has cc: www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/.../molenaar-verbeek.pdf |pg||
nt|cherdano:  with 4-4 in the majors, i would certainly double|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6@D is down on 22 so 13 to USA Blue.|pg||
nt|haans: agree with u there|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|haans: but only 1 down :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: south's bid helped west to find the 3N bid |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|jcwla: 2 is in from OR: 12 more to Neth. Orange for bidding and making 4@H doubled.  |pg||

pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|haans: i think 1@D is the normal transfer today|pg||
nt|lestergold: diamond barrage has not kept them out of the sensib le contract of 5c|pg||

pc|c9|nt|sybarra: probably right Hans |pg||

pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h7|nt|haans: did see the dummy did see it|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence could set up a diamond or spade trick to go with the ace of hearts but not both|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: 5cv of course is safe on a 4/2 heart break whereas 4h might have been shaky on such a break|pg||

nt|benjent: Good control by Doxiadis, passing over 2@h. Many a youth (and many-a-other) would bid 2@s there.|pg||

nt|benjent: I really like that @hJ switch. A trump looked like the right thing to play, so North gritted his teeth and played one despite his very unattractive holding|pg||

nt|petergill: if @H7 now, then @s to ace, @H exit = overtrick|pg||

nt|harmon: probably fit showing cause Justin always throws fits anyway|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s7|nt|petergill: In the other match on BBO (Poland versus another Dutch team), South simply bid 3NT over 1@H, since the overcall at this vulnerability should be sound|pg||
nt|benjent: Good lead by Molenaar - believes South's 3NT and tries out the unbid suit instead of his own|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petergill: The 2@d bid has helped guide West to the best lead of a spade|pg||
nt|benjent: That 7 is looking pretty high to Verbeek - he's torn between playing the 9 and the Q|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: A direct 3NT bid over 1@H gives the defence less info for finding the best lead and best defence - if 3NT is going to be the final contract, the less info you give the opposition, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: the better.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|benjent: The Q is the more positive view, and the right one I think (in theory as well as in practice)|pg||
nt|petergill: since the queen is more likely to lead to defeat of the contract than the nine is|pg||
nt|benjent: Good point you made about the bidding in the Poland match - solid overcalls have a variety of ways to win|pg||
nt|petergill: @CJ removes the entry to the @d's while the @d's are blocked|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|petergill: He can drop @DQx but then he has no entry to his hand|pg||
nt|benjent: Best now is probably to win @cA and play on hearts - hoping you can bring them home while sticking West on lead|pg||
nt|petergill: so declarer is in trouble - very good defence so far - 3 good moves - the @s lead (not obvious) the @SQ,(not obvious) and @CJ (fairly obvious)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|petergill: South can place West with @SA, @HK, @CK and almost certainly @DQ|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|petergill: Later, South will probably play @DA in case @DQ is singleton, then ducking a @D might put pressure on West later on. |pg||
nt|petergill: West might think South has @DAK10xx - can he visualise partner having that magical @D10xx - if so, a low club now is best. |pg||
nt|benjent: South's main chance to make now is stiff @dQ (which will let him take 5 diamond tricks directly)|pg||
nt|petergill: if West does not exit a spade now, West might have discarding difficulties on @d's later|pg||
nt|petergill: if West does exit a spade now, I meant|pg||
nt|petergill: West does best to play clubs, either small or the king. |pg||
nt|benjent: Verbeek looks like he's signalling for hearts - and a heart switch does look credible to him|pg||
nt|petergill: @S9 was upside down present count, to show three remaining spades, so West can count South for 3 spades (the ten being known from trick 1 play of @SQ) and five D@s|pg||
nt|benjent: Molenaar doesn't know how many clubs Verbeek started with - doubleton wouldn't be good for Molenaar|pg||
nt|petergill: the players have to create in their heads the layout that we can see for ourselves, hence much time is needed|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|petergill: if doubleton @CJx, then South has 3055 shape|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|petergill: so the drama continues - we still don't know if the contract will fail|pg||

nt|peachy: i would be tempted but prob not|pg||
nt|peachy: particularly opposing Precision players|pg||
nt|peachy: 4H could have been many types of hands|pg||
nt|roswolf: it should be a relay cue in that you ask opener to cue bid singletons or voids and is forcing to 5 of the trump suit|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jcwla: Better @C play by Lall in other room but chose to work on @H's rather than @S's and ended up the same down two for another push.|pg||
nt|haans: a passibility|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|cherdano:  1@C = 16+|pg||

nt|cherdano:  West can show his hand completely|pg||

nt|haans: often invite to game in spades|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|cherdano:  West opts for a stopperless 1N bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2d by unpassed hand should be forcing in imps game|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cherdano:  rather than 2@H with a flat hand and a 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: W beat him to keycard|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cherdano:  not clear what the best line for declarer is|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|shevek: it was at the other table|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cherdano:  i see 4@S was keycard|pg||
nt|cherdano:  knowing they are limited to 32 hcp, West doesn't try for grand - will be disappointed to find perfect cards with East|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6 a push at 3NT-2.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|haans: but the have a lot to do|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcwla: Same contract in OR -- hard to find out about the 5 @D tricks -- yet another push.|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: meckstroth says 'sorry my fault'|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: this seems like an overly cheerful auction|pg||
nt|buffytvs: exuberant I would say|pg||
nt|cherdano:  2N by East would have been enough|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think once West responded East was never letting him out|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i guess some would suggest that West should pass with 5 hcp, but since I know I would bid 1@H i won't criticize him for bidding :)|pg||
nt|lml: well 2NT is the book bid|pg||
nt|lml: yes he has aces but he is 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|lml: +1 and -1|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|cherdano:  4333 and 3 jacks|pg||

pc|h4|nt|haans: cross ruff|pg||

pc|hA|nt|lml: but then add a point or two for youth|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: altho 3n did go off in open room- its not an unreasonable contract to reach combined 24 with two 5 card suits and fair inmtermedoates all suits stopped|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|d7|nt|haans: @H lead to J and then after entry with @SK kill |pg||

nt|lml: I think he was hoping that the C!K was onside and the H!K|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h8|nt|buffytvs: scoring average has gone down -- only 8 IMPs per board now|pg||
nt|lestergold: im sure south intended her bid as forcing partnership needs to sort out this area|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lml: @CK and @HK|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i would have played a club to the king at trick 2|pg||
nt|haans: OR same bidding but only 3@S|pg||
pc|d9|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lml: he could make his diamond|pg||
pc|s7|nt|shevek: 3NT should've made, declarer didn't play it very well|pg||
nt|lestergold: played by south tio protect the clubs 3N has a good chance of coming home|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||

nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|cherdano:  not so easy to bid|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well done all around there.|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: a non vul 2 suiter |pg||
nt|haans: thats a new one|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: in NL  they call it Muiderberg |pg||
nt|cherdano:  still West can confirm keycards|pg||
nt|jcwla: 7 a push at 4@H making.  OR North opted to use Jacoby 2NT and South rebid 4@H.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|haans: with that weak hand?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think Verbeek is looking for some action here  |pg||
nt|bigtrain: normal precision it's easier...  E makes a @D positive then W can visualize grand|pg||
nt|cherdano:  confirm having all keycards, and sometimes East can just bid 7 on a spade or club trick source|pg||
nt|cherdano:  2@D showing a good heart raise|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some play that bidding 6 says a keycard is missing.|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s need to play this in 3N north may worry about diamonds but probably best just to punt it|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: or maybe it is just a 5 card (very) wk 2 |pg||
nt|haans: 3@H better than normal with @H|pg||
nt|lml: now vulnerable and with a 6 card suit this time I bid lots|pg||
nt|cherdano:  and this time it would be successful, too|pg||
nt|lml: yes :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: This looks like Puppet.|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh i feared this|pg||
nt|lestergold: now soutgh will think north is worried about spades|pg||
nt|shevek: they seem to be having a conversation...|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@s by south?|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u if 3n means i havent got spades but have got diamodns then all will be ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5c can make of course as cards lie|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 3n much more comfortable|pg||
nt|shevek: obviously north failed to bid 3NT because he thinks slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: the ten of dimaonds is the key card and its favourable|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: do you agree to such opening when P is not a passed hand|pg||
nt|cherdano:  so 2@D promised 3 hearts and 8+ points to be precise|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it depends on the meaning of the 3c raise- in modern stykle its unusually weakish|pg||
mb|3N|nt|buffytvs: wimpy pass|pg||
nt|shevek: she found the bid |pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: 'look for reasons to bid, not reasons not to bid'  D. Colbert|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: donmt as and we wont tell you|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  what did this double show?|pg||
nt|haans: tricky to make|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S much better|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|haans: playing with weak hands trumf|pg||
nt|roswolf: easier to go off than to make i think|pg||
nt|haans: W did open weak "@S in OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3s was kit telling or asking it wasnt fourth suit!|pg||
nt|shevek: it was right there in the bidding box :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: well this lead will not hurt|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lml: remember that old joke about my nose runs and my feet smell|pg||
nt|cherdano:  East has a nice stopper and a 6-card suit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: if matt has similar agreements to his dad...  2@D shows exactly 3@H and about 6-9 dummy points|pg||
nt|jcwla: OR is also playing 3@S.|pg||
nt|cherdano:  North bid 3@S in the other room instead of 2@S|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cherdano:  2@S doesnt look like enough to me either|pg||
nt|roswolf: playing to ruff a club should work|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lml: he is upside down|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|haans: and now only on a @D finesse|pg||

pc|h6|nt|bigtrain: personally i think 2@S is about right|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|petergill: 1@S = denies majors, shows "@d's or balanced" I think|pg||

nt|vugraphzuq: Next round will start about 40 munits later|pg||
nt|petergill: East's opening was very light, hence the poor game was reached. This is the slight downside of opening light, the light openers tell me, but they gain on other hands. |pg||
nt|petergill: East needed @SJ instead of @S8|pg||
nt|petergill: The Dutch accepted North's claim of 150, when the hand would have gone for 200 had there been no claim. Interesting. Reasonable, I guess.  |pg||
