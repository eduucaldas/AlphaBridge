nt|marlowepi: close to slam but too many soft values|pg||
nt|ady: nice easy 3NT for n/s to start     can make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cards :)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|nt|marlowepi: that is, S has too much soft stuff after 2N|pg||
nt|ady: might get to 6NT  going down|pg||
nt|sybarra: how about 6 @C?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nobody would make 12|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4NT by S and pass by N?|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C  is the best spot    if clubs 3-2  just need simple diamond finesse|pg||
nt|panja: South does not really have a good hand for slam..|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this is not an easy hand in the bidding. if S bids 4N, N will like the chances of 6C|pg||
nt|sybarra: skip the 6 @C comment, you need eyes on the ceiling|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's what a take-out double should look like|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: perfect indeed and 3@H on EW|pg||
nt|haans: and bidding clubs to get opps to high|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mdgraham: South can raise clubs, but does the 1@C opening show a real suit? |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: our operator is Genossar Itamar , shalom lecha!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some sort of raise to 4N?|pg||
nt|vugraphzuw: =]|pg||
nt|sybarra: or minors |pg||
nt|panja: 24 HCP missing in AK's...if N has 21 of them..some chance..if N has a J or a Q...2 key cards will be missing and slam is no better than 50%|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|sybarra: you just need a @S lead to the ace,  guess the stiff K of @D....and voila |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: as so oftenb happens, the 2N opening preempts the side who owns the hand, making delicate slam exploration extremely difficult|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: is this what Levin wanted with his pass?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is a very aggressive second double by East. Still, he is 65 imps down|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C a make|pg||
nt|haans: sort of ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West could easily have bid at his first opportunity - surely he cannot bid less than game now |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4@s like quantitative 4NT|pg||
nt|ady: if you gesss the stiff K@D   you only need one spade trick|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is true also |pg||
nt|marlowepi: why would anyone do that?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but how to do that?|pg||
nt|panja: y Marshall, absolutely..|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: there is a verb to describe that, and it is not "guess"|pg||
pc|hK|nt|panja: 2Nt is what I would like to designate as 'offside opening', too far too soon|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  may well be starting with a swing here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@c shows 4 cards in @c|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with decent support for all of pards suits I would have tried 3@H initially|pg||
nt|haans: Birman taking a chance|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this has good chances if declarer can pick the spades and clubs - and I think he will|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ady: OR  in 4NT I am told   so n/s  will ;ose a little here being in clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Both East's doubles were for take-out. A take-out double does not later metamorphose into a penalty double |pg||
nt|haans: levin could not bid 3@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Levin has converted, but q102 of clubs not a great holding|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|nt|kiwibridge: why not Haans seemed obvious|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: 8x 16 boards to play|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|haans: immediate yes but 3@H now?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|c3|pc|h3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Personally, I would have bid as West. At 65 down, defending 3@Cx on the first board with only Q10x of trumps opposite known shortage fails to appeal |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|kiwibridge: yes pard has reopened in case it was a trap pass, so I guess he has made two mistakes :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kiwibridge: he got spades right|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
pc|c6|pc|hT|pc|d2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: overtrick now!|pg||
nt|haans: Birman need new discussion NOW|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The psychological effect of this result could be considerable|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: depressingly so|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: just staying out of slam will make each NS hope for a swing. the slam is odds against single-dummy, but playable|pg||

nt|sharkey: N may refrain from leadin @S into the strong hand and lead a @D instead which makes this very interesting |pg||

nt|sharkey: actually 3 NT wud make on the actual layout with @H32 while 4@H is down |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  yes well judged by West to avoid the 8 card fit when he has fast tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: nice switch by S - easy with all hands in view - a lot harder at the table|pg||
pc|cK|nt|nigel_k:  Declarer is a trick short anyway so the defence ought to prevail eventually|pg||

nt|marlowepi: a scary holding|pg||
nt|ady: should be down 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: official website : http://www.israbridge.com/home/results/2009/trl-final.pdf|pg||
nt|panja: when a small @D is now played to @DQ....South will have to win allowing E the @DK entry to the fourth Diamond, and a useful @S discard late in the day|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC : http://tinyurl.com/np5cm3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S would go down on heart lead. presumably the ace. heart ruff and club shift takes out dummy's entry prematurely and declarer has to lose 2 diamonds|pg||

pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: You could argue that 2NT by East before was a slight underbid. Not sure what 2NT shows for them, but it's worth 22.35 on the K&R Hand Evaluator|pg||

nt|hedyg: 2@HX was -1 with @d lead and repeated play|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: depends what a bid shows and what a passs shows|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think 2@s should show a clear preference|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 3@S will not excite Alon|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  South should place North with some clubs, along with hearts and diamonds|pg||
nt|sharkey: what's N to do - 3 NT?|pg||
mb|d|nt|sharkey: which W may Dbl|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The 3â  will therefore cause North to misevaluate his spade shortage|pg||

mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: Congratulations to all of you who lasted the course.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hedyg: play on @hs, let E make a @d by overruffing|pg||
nt|hedyg: then play AK@D, ruff 1 more @H, ruff 1@c and disc 1 @c on the last @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: more and more have seen it (open room closed long ago)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|d|nt|sybarra: hmm now what |pg||
nt|hedyg: usually the 3@d bid shows 4cards...|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @D  and then what|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 5 @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s was cuebid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kiwibridge: thanks Mike and Haans it has been a pleasure, albeit a stretched out one|pg||
nt|haans: true |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4@s was natural in case N had 5/6 @d and 4 @ss|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably 5C over 3S would have been void-showing (possibly exclusion). otherwise it might be an appealing call|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Misunderstanding in the open room. South's jump to 3@C interpreted as promising a fit for hearts|pg||
nt|haans: herbst end it nice|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kiwibridge: will there be a concession or will I need more coffee for the next set :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I need a large beer :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|sybarra: now for the challenge |pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont think you can time it for making 6 |pg||
nt|hedyg: as "runnerup" says the line works if you play AK@D first as well|pg||
nt|marlowepi: seems fairlyu straightforward to make this by setting up hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: if you try ruffing 2@cs you are down|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: sometimes @hs are even 3-3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: well this should help|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont need 33 hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will help |pg||
nt|sybarra: didnt mean to echo Hedy |pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Emmylou just winked at me I think|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|hedyg: now just need @d split|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this lead gives declarer options, i.e. trying to cater to 4 trumps in the W hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: N knew from the 5 @H bid that S did not have the Q@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: but nowhere to go from the 5 @H level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you're making me jealous|pg||

nt|sharkey: 2@S by W and end up in 3@D?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|sharkey: agree Nick - it looks better than many 5 card suits I've overcalled|pg||
mb|p|nt|nicksan: Just makes sure that you're beating any game the opponents may try...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - if EW had an 11-13 NT in their arsenal it would make after 1 NT - 3 NT and a natural @H lead - unless S Dbl 3 NT|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not so sure that the overcall was such a good idea. Now E-W had the chance to spot the weakness in spades; they might not have had that below 3@D in an uncontested auction|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|sharkey: where wud you end up Roland - facing a passed hand?|pg||
nt|nicksan: True, but if North had to lead against 3 NT, as Carl said, he may guess wrong.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West might make a game try beyond 3@D. I am not saying he would, just that it was a possibility|pg||
nt|nicksan: I much prefer to set the defence on the right track...|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS cud also have a @S partial|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: last board of this segment now|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|hedyg: our thanks to Itamar Ginossar ,our oustanding operator in Israel! great job!to my excellent fellow commentators Shirley Ybarra, Marshall Lewis, David Edwin, Prakash K. Paranjape ...|pg||

nt|sybarra: thx Hedy |pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: thank you all for joining, we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
mb|r|nt|hedyg: we will be back after a short break|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: different folks have different views about how to open hands like N. put me down for 1D|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Itamar you have done a great job, thanks from all of us|pg||
nt|mdgraham: This is very impressive by the Herbst team. No so much scoring 142 but in conceding only 25 imps in 48 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzuw: thank you|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: you are playing winning bridge if you concede one-and-a-half imps a board. Half an imp per board is incredible.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Perfect stop by Pachtman-Ginossar in the other room|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 3@D the last makeable contract|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes indeed, as I said earlier Zak and Mic have had an incredible set|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence can let this through...NS have been card-perfect so far|pg||
nt|Walddk4: On the other hand, will Zack lead a spade?|pg||
nt|haans: i do have 6 dim|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|haans: only need a hearts lead|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|hedyg: the Herbst brothers open 1@c with 4 4 hands ( we saw earlier)|pg||
