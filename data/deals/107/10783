nt|Walddk5: an  i   missing in  Kilani|pg||
nt|chick: 2@C a precision type bid, showing opening hand with 6+ clubs (or 5 clubs + 4 major)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5@d on NS|pg||
nt|chick: well, never mind that, apparently a different system :)|pg||
nt|chick: a canape type bid instead|pg||

nt|wygbe1: this should make|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi Basar|pg||
nt|han: 1S - 2H -p- p - p seems a normal auction|pg||
nt|han: the only alternative would be a 1NT overcall by east|pg||
nt|sybarra: N is mtvesuvius on bbo |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Some kind of war between systems|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: hi all welcome|pg||

nt|iris100:  made 12 tricks in the open room|pg||
nt|iris100:  11|pg||
nt|iris100:  only small @S lead (not very likely) holds it to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|wygbe1: south can do the same by winning in hand, cashing d ace, and leading a spade - setting up the spade suit with ruffs, as h are 22|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
nt|don paulus: hi hans & basar|pg||
nt|haans: fast players|pg||
nt|petergill: Andy Hung from Australia might be inspired to try a crafty switch to a heart (like a man with no king) or perhaps @DJ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A @s shift is needed now|pg||

nt|marlowepi: choice)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sharynr: hi haans :)|pg||

nt|chick: so a push board and lost opportunity|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The defence is wide awake - took all their tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: do not hard cards for 6@D|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|don paulus: another 3 nt - EW this time|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|don paulus: y favourable @c split|pg||
nt|sybarra: precision type 1 @D |pg||
nt|chick: yes, if @Cs were 4-4, he could lose the @DQ, @SJ and @C for -1.  in the end, I think he just figured that was true no matter how he played, and just finessed and hoped|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: X by S 2@S by W should end it|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Joe WLC|pg||
nt|don paulus: may pass out now|pg||
nt|sybarra: not mine either |pg||
nt|chick: it's at least a point short of opening by my standards, too|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: west alerted its majors|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can vote for 2@C or 1nt:)?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Morning Rashed|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|rnmalik: Pass would do them good.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: Basar is our operator and he's a great one :)|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: he should pass this|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would you give a try for 3NT by E|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But will probably venture 3NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D lead by S would hurt.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes @D sinks it|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: ý heard like  "min. hand and no 4 cards @H"  on 2@D alert|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|haans: that is my choice|pg||
nt|santyclz: (Rashed), sry.|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: an other fast claim?|pg||

nt|santyclz: We can guess, any game force, bal min, relay, ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think Visser can bid 3 nt now |pg||
nt|petergill: The Argentina youth flew from Argentina to New Zealand, then to Turkey, so is probably the most travelled competitor in the field. |pg||
nt|wygbe1: i also would have passed|pg||

nt|jaapfr: Noname=? besides no name:)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzus: they started early .so i missed the first board s play.sorry.|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: np|pg||
nt|haans: nothing to see or miss|pg||
nt|don paulus: we got the result - thats fine|pg||
nt|sybarra: tremendous number of frequent flyer miles!|pg||
nt|petergill: If played by East, a heart lead would shoot 3NT. |pg||
nt|han: East can now hold it to 4|pg||
nt|han: by playing a low heart|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a crazy auction to say the least :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: must be bad defense-@S lead only helps|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|haans: sound polish|pg||
nt|rnmalik: all roads lead to 11|pg||
nt|rnmalik: tough as I see it. |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Early lead for Noname, NS made 5@D on board 1|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tweety1: afraid to finess? :)|pg||
nt|han: declarer could have guaranteed +1 by playing the heart jack at trick 1|pg||

nt|petergill: I think Michael Whibley is in NZ's Open Team in Brazil next month, so he has a lot of World Championship bridge to play in the next month.  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: if S bid as aggressively as N on the previous hand, he would bid 2C for majors over 1NT (if available)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: OTs looming S no entry|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Cant set up the long @S and enjoy it so looks like no way to avoid 3 losers|pg||

nt|Walddk5: tomorrow|pg||
nt|jaapfr: previous sessions same story some 8 dull boards and then 1 or 2 firecrackers|pg||
nt|mcarroll: E bid 3NT in Open|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very true|pg||
mb|1S|nt|santyclz: This hand has some action potential.|pg||
nt|haans: we all say the same :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|iris100:  standard 4@S now|pg||
nt|han: I guess that was impossible, east would need to have 2362 shape and west wouldn't have a 2D raise|pg||
mb|2C|nt|don paulus: 2 @h NS ?|pg||
nt|don paulus: gambling 3 nt|pg||
nt|jaapfr: how to get opps out of 4@S|pg||
nt|don paulus: think N should escape|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 3@D max|pg||
nt|petergill: EW will bid to 4@S, Blair Fisher will bid 5@D, then what?|pg||
nt|haans: slam in spades|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S Michaels, 5/5 spades and a minor|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think to 5 @H by n/s|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S EW|pg||
nt|han: East can double now to show values|pg||
nt|sybarra: this look lebensohlish by Cam |pg||
nt|jaapfr: fine 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: 1st board a push|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H I mean|pg||
nt|sybarra: in tempo pls.  5 @H |pg||
nt|haans: 6@S please|pg||
nt|han: the doubleton spade is about perfect for the double|pg||
nt|chick: 3N pretty solid again|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: how to make opps pass|pg||
nt|garnetts: Interesting choice by East--but if 1@C is nebulous it is probably best to pass|pg||
nt|haans: 7@H good sac|pg||
nt|petergill: Blair might bid 5@C or 5@D or 5@H, I'm not sure which|pg||
nt|sybarra: there is the lead director |pg||
nt|wygbe1: i would think south is worth 2s, and n has easy raise to 4|pg||
nt|han: I think 2S is a very bad call|pg||
nt|han: but E may know better|pg||
nt|chick: apparently so|pg||
nt|jaapfr: do i see a phantom i think 5@S can be made|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|haans: not right|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we're back|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@C cue is his choice, as a slam try|pg||
nt|petergill: Blair is on lead to @s, so it is not lead directing|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Andy Vinock|pg||
nt|tweety1: dbl cld be better|pg||
nt|don paulus: always lose 3 @c ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb  not|pg||
nt|don paulus: or ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Gambling 3N is on my short list for Silliest Convention ever devised|pg||
pc|s4|nt|garnetts: I really do not like that with only four hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: true sorry |pg||
nt|petergill: Luke bids 6@C, in case they have a 4-4 club fit with his @d losers able to be discarded on the long @H's |pg||
nt|haans: looks like 6@S will be the end|pg||
nt|petergill: Andy Hung now thinks that partner has @D's!|pg||
nt|haans: after a cue cannot sac|pg||
nt|petergill: The lack of entries to dummy makes the play of @H contracts difficult|pg||
nt|haans: if hung x no 6@S|pg||
nt|petergill: Andy Hung is one of the stars of Australian youth bridge - he has won international youth events such as the Pacific Asia Teams playing for Australia|pg||
nt|han: hi Andy|pg||
nt|chick: E showing his other suit|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sharynr: what would you bid Hans, with east hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: another boring board|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now the passed hand starts to push|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3nt?|pg||
nt|chick: if leb, this is an invitation by S|pg||
nt|sybarra: lebensohl requests pard to bid 3 @C and then will show suit |pg||
nt|chick: her* sorry :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|han: this would make it easier for west to bid 4S though|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sure with helpful lead:)|pg||
nt|cindy:  6 @s is a little rich|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|haans: nothing |pg||
nt|sybarra: nothing wrong with 5 clubs is there?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  1@s is not enough with South, maybe she was considering 3@s|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North will raise to game anyway|pg||
nt|iris100:  for a junior, 2@S is quite disciplined|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning Roland, Veysel, Han and everyone|pg||
nt|tweety1: hello Andy|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@C makes|pg||
nt|chick: this can be set, but sure not obviously enough to warrant a double|pg||
nt|cindy:  one fixed, stay fixed|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think 6@S too much bravery   agree?|pg||
nt|cindy:  once fixed|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: but close to something|pg||
nt|sharynr: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: forcing pass by Andy?|pg||
nt|haans: if NS find there 8 @H EW more likely to find spades|pg||
nt|don paulus: interesting lead for declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with @H lead much tougher|pg||
nt|chick: will certainly paint the picture of how to play it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too many losers for 6S. pd was under pressure. you want to REWARD him for making a winning competitve decision, not punish him|pg||
pc|d8|nt|haans: 2-2 in M do not like|pg||
nt|rnmalik: but only 8 tricks on @D lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|chick: ummm, yes you are right, can set up hearts for the losing diamond|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we lost our score from board 2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1, if no defense error|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and got away with it|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: screen has gone down.declarer asking some questions|pg||
nt|santyclz: I wasn't recommending 3nt, but half expected it in a jr's game.|pg||
nt|tweety1: no excitement this brd  a draw|pg||
pc|d5|nt|petergill: Great 6@S bid by Andy Hung|pg||
nt|ybob: 8 tricks cold|pg||
nt|han: declarer worries about diamonds being 3-1|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petergill: Note that even with two aces, Blair Fisher has the discipline not to double 6@S|pg||
nt|haans: does not need @DK right but no @D lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@S is a good sac over 5@C, won't get a good score tho :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sharynr: but looks like a good hand for vul save|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|petergill: For those (like me) who find access to the website and its Results page (including its Running Scores section) almost impossible, here are the standings after 5 matches, with some ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Round 6 results in brackets|pg||
nt|sybarra: per spec:  juniors invite and later bid 5S|pg||
nt|chick: lebensohl did them in ... let E show his clubs and W then knows what to do :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|han: but there is little he can do about that|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this is what we like, lots of excitement|pg||
nt|rnmalik: unfavourable cards placement for W and 2@C|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|haans: did hung bid it to make?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kiwibridge: will be -1 in the end|pg||
nt|andyv:  can always play for the revoke|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's going to be a high scoring match|pg||
nt|rnmalik: seems so|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Neth will go into lead as 3NT coming home on 2 - no @D lead|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: for me its not even oprimarily about too rich or too brave. its about the effect of bids like 6S on partnership---W should WANT his pd to bid aggressively in these situations, and ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the way to encourage him to keep doing so is to give him some slack|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i saw as phantom 2x playing from dummy the clubs and 2x N AK and so developing @CJ as tr 11|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kiwibridge: double swing = 9+ to noname|pg||
nt|don paulus: good play @h from top for communication|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c5|nt|kiwibridge: yes  simple 3@S better bid|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|nigel_k:  Declarer delaying drawing trumps as she needs to ruff two clubs|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petergill: After 5 rounds, 40 teams, USA Blue lead on 111, Italy Red 94, Greecour 93 (plus 13 in Round 6), Egypt 91, Neth Red 91 (plus 17 in Rd 6), Team 42 90, Neth Blue 90, Japan-Czech 88. ...|pg||
nt|petergill: They are the top eight. After 13 rounds, the top eight teams qualify for the Finals|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|garnetts: No point in asking questions ----needs the Q@S onside for one light|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kiwibridge: defense error = 8+ to ckis|pg||
nt|garnetts: Interestingly the defence will need to be on their toes to crack 4@H played by west|pg||
nt|sybarra: lots of folks suggesting S might even have 4 @S directly |pg||
pc|h4|nt|han: well done by both tables to get to 4@s|pg||

nt|don paulus: nm|pg||

nt|han: Egypt and Noname are currently ranked 16th and 18th, and to get to the top 8 they could really need a big score this round|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: oh, I am sure it shows minors BUT....|pg||

mb|2H!|an|rel|nt|haans: E make NS not bid slam?|pg||

nt|rnmalik: no doubt on lead of A@S only|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Information.htm  for the tournament website, but Service Unavailable quite frequently I am sorry to say|pg||
nt|santyclz: A good hand for contructive jump shifts, a treatment we seldom see in the US.|pg||
nt|haans: after S pass you can act knowing THEY have game|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A bit careless then as two clubs can be ruffed with @sK and @sJ, losing only to @sQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  these first few hands aren't helping either of them|pg||

nt|marlowepi: most people who find themselves in that situation automatically start rethinking their podition :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 4@D is better than 4@H here as it suggests defensive cards and helps West guage what to do if NS continue|pg||

nt|petergill: Sorry that we cannot access the website so have to rely on locals at Yeditepe University in Istanbul providing info to us. |pg||

nt|iris100:  4@C wont cheer N up|pg||

nt|vugraphzus: sorry for connection problem|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But there will be 2@d from S and 2@h fromE|pg||
mb|3D!|an|rel|nt|haans: can they miss now|pg||
nt|han: North has 11 HCP, but they look so bad|pg||
nt|han: it's tough to pass with 11 HCP though|pg||
nt|sybarra: you shouid have seen them at DC Nationals |pg||
nt|chick: maybe so, but it's still a lot of pressure|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'd think I would love it too, if only we could get the world youth watching|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes. After 2@C GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: K @h counted as a key card - so = 2|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone know what 2N inquires?|pg||
nt|sybarra: especially now since many are out of school |pg||
mb|3S!|an|1-5-3-4|nt|haans: 5nt = all + Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: cant miss now|pg||
nt|don paulus: 2 of the remaining 3 kings now|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: should bid 7nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he did|pg||
nt|iris100:  I donÂ´t think this will make|pg||
nt|mcarroll: As does 5@C if follows the Rabbi's Law and drops singleton @CK|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: only bad if partner double|pg||
nt|ybob: 9@H is a nice card !!|pg||
nt|haans: and N have found a lead|pg||
nt|cindy:  making 3 i guess|pg||
nt|rnmalik: A@C safety play|pg||
mb|3N|nt|haans: you have no reason to lead clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: After 6 rounds, USA Blue lead on 130, Japan-Czech 2nd on 112 or 113 , Neth Red on 108, Greecour on 106, Italy Red 105, Aotearoa 102, 42 and others somewhere up there too|pg||
nt|han: I wonder what 3@c is, I would have bid 4@c with the south hand (splinter with 4 trumps) but maybe NS can show that hand in a different way|pg||
nt|han: Operator, can you find out what these bids mean for us?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a modest 1 imp for Noname i presume|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: a very easy grand to bid|pg||
nt|haans: claim before 1st trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: a very fast match|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes but maybe North did not bid enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: it did mean expect 4-1 in all suits|pg||
nt|andyv:  S is only a 12 count and N did pass originally, so jumping to 4@c seems a bit optomistic|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: they are just whispering.cant hear them .sorry|pg||
nt|tweety1: 2nt shows strenght here i guess|pg||
nt|jaapfr: she likely hits@SAK for 9 and suddenly makes 12 tr lol|pg||
nt|cindy:  or more|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|petergill: Jorrit Schafer from Belgium does not double, in case 6@S or 6NT is makeable|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rnmalik: acdemic discussion-you see any chance for 5@D|pg||
nt|haans: W has 18 hcp that is also hard to understand|pg||
nt|don paulus: 4 @c 2 @h 2 @s 1 @d|pg||
nt|han: yes good point Andy, in that case I would just bid 4@h|pg||
nt|han: I think it is impossible to stop in 3@h with the south hand once north moves over 2@h|pg||
nt|tweety1: 4 @c or +h may seem attractive but remember your pd is a passed hand|pg||
nt|tweety1: NS knows that they have 23 hp max|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|sybarra: we do have an optimistic Blair today |pg||
nt|tweety1: umm 3 @c is a great bid then|pg||
nt|tweety1: N shd have stop at 3 level with a mass hand like his..|pg||
nt|han: I don't agree unless NS have a way to show a club splinter below 3@h, which I strongly doubt|pg||
nt|andyv:  have to play @hs for one loser...since W needs to be kept out of lead after @d shift, probably need to dbl hook the @hs|pg||
nt|tweety1: see the alert Han|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2@C 2@D and 1@S loser|pg||
nt|jaapfr: more than 12:)?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kiwibridge: 4-0 break|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk5: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=10  for standings after 10 rounds. First 8 after 13 rounds advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: tomorrow|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with their playstations etc if they could be shown what fun this  game is and you get to meet people all over the world|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharynr: i would think 5-0|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but still possible|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Looks like that|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: singel bids make it easy for defence  to defend. very rarely told|pg||
pc|h9|nt|petergill: Blair's bidding was optimistic, and his card play excellent, when I partnered him in the San Francisco Nationals about 20 months ago. |pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzus: they rrelayed with 3@C and 3@D bids.to describe many hands.i just got a note|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
nt|tweety1: will be same -2 here too i bet:)|pg||
nt|tweety1: shldnt touch the trumps|pg||
nt|garnetts: hi all--sorry I am late connection failed|pg||
nt|tweety1: hi|pg||
nt|andyv:  S did not seem to have a plan on how to play the hand in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: screen went down and declarer is asking some questions to east now|pg||
nt|andyv:  and W shifted to the 10@d at trick 2 which I think poses a lot more problems for declarer than does @S shift|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he is still thinking|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|cindy:  no more than 9 :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|haans: :)|pg||

nt|tweety1: playing the best line seems|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: well played|pg||
pc|c7|nt|haans: i think 3@S was natural = u may pass|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|haans: 31C cannot have been gf|pg||
nt|sybarra: to me,  3 @S would have been the "bigger" slam interest hand |pg||
nt|cindy:  cashing i guess|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok 12|pg||
nt|don paulus: can go down now if @s finesse|pg||
nt|cindy:  for 12|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petergill: Blair usually plays a Strong Club system, but when playing with Luke Gardiner or Luke's mother Val or me, he play our natural-based system|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ralfwil: and now E has problems|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
nt|don paulus: extra @c now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|iris100:  how? @CQ doesnt hold|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzus: i guess 3 cl bid was pscyhic|pg||
nt|petergill: A bit lucky to drop only 5 imps there|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like a splinter to me |pg||
nt|haans: if psych you bid 3@D instead|pg||
nt|sybarra: or mini splinter, but I dont like it with Jxx of @D|pg||
nt|tweety1: all clear by defence now|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzus: he played jack|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|tweety1: :(|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|vugraphzus: east has pitched a @D early .so it made +2|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|nigel_k:  Yes you're right|pg||
nt|andyv:  just too hard to untangle everything|pg||
pc|hT|nt|iris100:  down 2|pg||
nt|iris100:  what happened? how did N make another trick?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  One extra diamond ruff in hand earlier and declarer could have made A9 of spades at the end|pg||
pc|d2|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|tweety1: hard to understand @d j|pg||
mc|12|nt|vugraphzus: east and north are laughing after @C K drops|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good technique rewarded - as Rashad pointed out the @C A as a safety play works|pg||

nt|cindy:  thats a most ugly 12 N is holding|pg||

nt|rnmalik: thought P might take @C finesse:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: computer is in nasty mood, what hands|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NS have 4@S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: our kib from venuzuela made strait at start the correct analysis : develop 5th @S and endplay N to make it (if defense attacked trumps soon:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The mistake was to win the first @h return on the hand instead of the table to set up the @s|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kiwibridge: yes a shapely lot with many traps for young players :)|pg||

nt|rnmalik: do we see 6@D for EW|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk5: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Information.htm  for the tournament website. Better link than the one before|pg||

nt|haans: serenisima say 'doesnt happen only to me' and right you are :)))|pg||
nt|ybob: D. D. win 6@H|pg||
nt|iris100:  3SA now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same contract and play in Open so flat board - the level of technical ability is impressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Arend Bayer|pg||
nt|cherdano:  hello everyone|pg||
nt|rnmalik: brave bid of 2NT-no negative DBL|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: south alerted 3 cl but not north|pg||
nt|chick: good discipline by E|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very correct|pg||
mb|d!|nt|petergill: Juan from Argentina let 1NT go, but Andy bids 2@D Multilandy|pg||
nt|chick: its hard to give up on a suit like that one :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H and 5@Seak|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: w|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  do we know whether NS have an agreement about 4@H?|pg||
nt|sharynr: would 1NT not be enough?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes and 3@S?|pg||
nt|garnetts: very marginal game at best|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes |pg||
nt|garnetts: I think that North should bid 4@S ---very prime 17 for a suit|pg||
nt|chick: 11 IMPs if they make this |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: what would 1nt has showed|pg||
nt|haans: sry|pg||
nt|sharynr: this hand i believe|pg||
nt|garnetts: North would have done better to call 1@S and investigate over the 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good for morale : thanks pard I am min ; np I'll bid my hand again|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D = one long major|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt was massive bidding :(|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sharynr: but we have seen thay East likes to bid....so lets see how she plays now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no great number of @C tricks and entries will be few|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he write some notes.cant see it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 12 tricks without a @h shift|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cherdano:  good slam but not that easy to bid over the interference by EW|pg||
nt|rnmalik: to me it does not make-@H lead no entry no 3rd entry|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H pass or correct|pg||
nt|cindy:  5-2 fits usually play better than 4-3 fits|pg||
nt|jaapfr: they did what you asked Cindy (but il love the 4-3 fits)|pg||
nt|cindy:  :-)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharynr: This must be very exciting for the players, coming together to Istanbul!|pg||
nt|haans: may be hard for them to play their best bridge|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: needs @S switch now|pg||
nt|sybarra: the dbl gives som clues |pg||
nt|sybarra: but is it enough |pg||
nt|haans: multilandy are the hottest thing around just now|pg||
nt|tweety1: ah|pg||
nt|chick: I know we're not supposed to have favorites when commentating, but I sure can't help cheering for a 13 year old, regardless of country :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1 @D entry to play Q@S game over|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it depends on a lot of factors|pg||
nt|cindy:  it does|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true but imo the 4-3 highly underrated (generally)|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, it can make.  W has to guess 4-1 rather than 5-0.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This can be 4 off|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with such @S holding short suit lead slightly not proper|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jaapfr: but mb me too pessimistic and IF 5@S will S not be very much attempted to lead once a high @C:)?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sybarra: I think the "girls" are not much old if at all |pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he didnt cover 9 |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well done|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the cold 4@H was doubled for 7 away last board|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Easy nine tricks when diamonds break evenly and maybe 10 if declarer guesses which major suit finesse to take|pg||
nt|tweety1: refused 1 more imp:)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|cherdano:  and it was easily bid by Italy at the other table without interference|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: seems 7 |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: 7@d is good save |pg||
nt|sybarra: ML defense to nt is just like ML opening,  @D= one long major and 2 @C = stayman and 2 of either major is that  5 card of that major and a minor|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kiwibridge: here is the bad news|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or had a go at 6@C only failing on the awful break|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: multilandy = 2@C for majors (Landy) and 2@D like a multi two opening, with 2M = 5+M and either 4+minor|pg||
nt|haans: or 4 cards in M + longer minor|pg||
nt|petergill: I make a good echo. :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)  at least the specs now know |pg||
nt|sybarra: btw Ilike it also |pg||
nt|petergill: This should go down, especially if declarer plays a spade to the king (likely, normal)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: not sure that hurt |pg||
nt|santyclz: That eases the guess somewhat.|pg||
nt|andyv:  everyone loves to finesse|pg||
nt|andyv:  strip and endplay would have worked here|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|sharynr: they will warm up soon|pg||
nt|mcarroll: only 3 off now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same contract in Open|pg||

pc|s2|nt|don paulus: fell asleep ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all bad news for S now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: -2 I think|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I may be wrong but 2 @C with S would justify 2NT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: now can roll home |pg||
nt|sybarra: as long as declarer does try a early @D |pg||
nt|don paulus: complete misfit and "only" 31 pts|pg||
nt|don paulus: so 6 nt far away|pg||
nt|haans: wityh a good hearts = + at least 2 point to me|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: alternative give up 1 @S|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|don paulus: well - after 3nt by E - no reason for W to try slam ?|pg||

nt|sharynr: they may now have the "why not 1nt partner" conversation?|pg||
nt|haans: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: this is like a football match for now|pg||
nt|garnetts: No point in having a gadget if you use it and ignore it |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, yet one slip defence it could have made|pg||
nt|garnetts: death trap for NS here |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: north seems excited with his hand:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes could get too high in @D|pg||
nt|petergill: I think South should duck the first spade, that solves the problem, as declarer will surely play the king. |pg||
nt|haans: no but 3nt with 16 hcp after a jump?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: north pitched a club .so it makes +2|pg||
nt|iris100:  quite boring boards - another standard game|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: yes 0-0|pg||
nt|sybarra: if angry probably at himself |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: south i mean|pg||
nt|chick: I'm told that Dekkers is 25, Nab 21 ... thanks for the info to the kib who knew :)|pg||
nt|chick: partscores here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1@H-p-p- 1nt?-2@C-?|pg||
mb|1D!|an|+4!D|nt|don paulus: no big swing this board|pg||
nt|garnetts: hard not to|pg||
nt|haans: here we may fi9nd why 3nt. they use Big Clubs|pg||
nt|haans: so 3@H was weaker that i belived|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They may think about slam on this one but need to identify the poor trumps|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H can make here but not bid :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  so would be a good safe, but only if you are sure 6@S is making|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: against 6 @S i meant|pg||
nt|cherdano:  yes|pg||
nt|cherdano:  3@H is probably a mixed raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: east is very aggresive player|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the web site is down again but here it is http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Istanbul.htm|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I might have played @D 9 after @CA|pg||
nt|santyclz: Excellent idea.|pg||
nt|don paulus: 6 @h now ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is "old" in this tourney |pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  sorry|pg||
nt|cherdano:  preemptive|pg||
nt|sharynr: the OR tried 6@h on bd 14, failing for an 11 imps loss|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's a beaut hand sad break|pg||
nt|ybob: win 13 tricks|pg||
nt|rgdruru: 7@h i think|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nab could have saved there with the double @C@H fit thx Pieter for pointing that out|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and then in all directions:)|pg||
nt|cindy:  dunno  2@c or dbl ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: but not now after only 1@D --what do you need these days for 2@C opening|pg||
nt|chick: personally, I think it's too old to play as a junior, but I suppose there aren't enough 13-18 year olds to fill a tourney like this|pg||
nt|jaapfr: all cards very well placed|pg||
nt|chick: even 4@H depends on good lie of the cards|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even DD i do not know what to do as S now|pg||
nt|don paulus: Laura would like 2 @s by S :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: IMO W has a better 2@C overcall here than when he did overcalll a couple of boards ago|pg||
pc|h7|nt|cherdano:  i would just bid 2@H at red/white and with @SKxxx|pg||
nt|sybarra: do they play wk nt Peter? |pg||
nt|andyv:  smolen?|pg||
nt|tweety1: yes|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes any time|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharynr: i think east REALLY likes to bid!|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yeah.very|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this is the under 26 tourney not the under 21|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: Bd 5: Luke Gardiner gave correct upside down count in @d's with @D7, and playing a heart back instead of a club was reasonable, so no need for a post mortem. |pg||
nt|garnetts: Good idea to upgrade here --even thogh it might not work out too well|pg||
nt|chick: is there an under-21 world tourney?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: adam is checking their convention card|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @dA as well as @hQ in front etc|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even unbeatable with any lead and any defense|pg||
nt|chick: even so, takes perfect play to make it, almost double dummy play|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|haans: correct bid as per Blue team in the 60th|pg||
nt|sharynr: would be nice to have DBL mean "takeout or leave it in partner, you can do both"|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: no big decisions|pg||
nt|haans: soon @D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@S on the 4-3 was very well done other room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H 4@S NS-another flat I think|pg||
nt|haans: to slow to show spade void |pg||
nt|iris100:  But as even 5@S makes|pg||
nt|cindy:  whats wrong with pass by S ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: oeff 2@H by W is guts|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Board 5 was flat|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kiwibridge: OR did go via 1@S but still reached 4@H last one|pg||
nt|sybarra: same auction as other table |pg||
pc|dA|nt|kiwibridge: or a failing 3N :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: takes the punt ouch|pg||
nt|petergill: 10-12 NT at this vul and position|pg||
nt|sybarra: thus the @D opening |pg||
nt|ybob: 4@S exclusion 5@H 2+Q|pg||
nt|cindy:  S has nothing to write home about|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|garnetts: Not that bad a bid just that bad a result|pg||
nt|ybob: now 7@H|pg||
nt|haans: are you sure?|pg||
nt|ybob: 99 %|pg||
nt|andyv:  will be much tougher to dble here than in OR where W opened with 1@D|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ybob: can E bid 5@H if 4@S cue ????|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they are combined here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Best switch - means no @C ruff|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another flat board I think|pg||
nt|ybob: maybe regular KCA|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah - W has no trump to return when in with @CA so the ruff is still available|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cherdano:  declarer has to be a bit careful here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D lead difficult|pg||
nt|petergill: Good lead by Andy Hung, better than say @DK|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North realizes South has heart shortage so the hands fit badly|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But I think we all have played worse contract than 4@h on this board....|pg||
nt|jaapfr: as a kib says: just go with the book|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kiwibridge: 4th highes from longest suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: often works|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6@D is confusing|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another swing|pg||
nt|garnetts: harder to find a @D lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be a good pick up for e|pg||
nt|andyv:  Egypt|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@D+1@H+1@C+1@S=5, 2@D as it is will make|pg||
pc|s9|nt|andyv:  I guess not that hard:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: mazybe not |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there would have been seperate events if enought entries it says|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: all cards wrong for declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: except @HJ10|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rgdruru: Incredible since they stay in 6|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: @CQ good technique again, makes W think about whether Pd has !K|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sharynr: the Dutch women (Girls?) have taken the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: played 8 of spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: and now he is sad:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: have a lot of sympathy---the 6@D bid shows character and understanding |pg||
nt|garnetts: Should get the clubs right after this |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Strange defense Likely to end play himself|pg||
nt|santyclz: Quite.  Doesn't quite do it for declarer though.|pg||
nt|haans: they have to go back home and have a little talk|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: is usa using 1@D opening as 10-15 with 2+@D?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jaapfr: @H @H without thinking she must be very tired|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rnmalik: 8 tricks only|pg||
nt|petergill: but the contract figures to fail, after this good lead and good defence, I think|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like -2 here also|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cherdano:  now EW can get a trump promotion|pg||
nt|cherdano:  with @SK and three rounds of diamond|pg||
nt|chick: yeah, that's what I figured... too bad :(|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=12  for standings after 12 rounds. Top 8 after this round advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: tomorrow|pg||
nt|cindy:  what time is it there ?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: spade 8 was a little to much|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: how to get them right?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kiwibridge: 10 imps again|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I love these short matches lots of swings great stuff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: an indictment on the wbf really|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 19:22|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|ybob: but if 4@S was normaly KCA its a wrong bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Wrong tempo for 10 tricks now|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c5|nt|cherdano:  but the @D pitch prevents that|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: still down|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|petergill: @H to 9 was the winning play if you can see all 52 cards, as we can|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|nt|rnmalik: do or die stuff-one swing to win the match:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the most logic play after @DK was @CK|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kiwibridge: wrong!|pg||
nt|garnetts: A@C and Club to the Q then finesse|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|sJ|nt|haans: just about|pg||
nt|haans: why did W never polay @D?|pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, with the other hand dummy, an innocent enough @HJ switch by the Argentinian East allowed the contract to make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: rather dull boards until now hope it changes soon|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|sQ|nt|kiwibridge: well that solved it|pg||
nt|haans: was close|pg||
nt|petergill: West deduced perhaps that there was no rush to play @D's|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: need to return a club after @d 10 to get promotion|pg||
mc|8|nt|haans: played clubs  late|pg||

nt|sharynr: i might suggest a passed out hand, but East is here :)|pg||
nt|haans: have been a winner for me|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: another big one to Noname|pg||
nt|santyclz: Tough hand, both for declarer and defense.|pg||
nt|sybarra: N/S are going to feel snake bit on this set |pg||
nt|haans: just play @CK before dim entry|pg||
nt|haans: and get extra clubs trick|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 5 more imps for Egypt|pg||
nt|tweety1: EW finds the slam and becomes the new leader :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  a chance for E/W as slam seems reasonable|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so usa red have clawed back the deficit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For 10 tricks the @h finess must be done early|pg||
nt|jaapfr: who plays 1nt here?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok cindy where does this end:)?|pg||
mb|1C!|an|+2!c|nt|cherdano:  yes locking declarer in dummy would have worked too to beat it legitimately|pg||
nt|haans: and N|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 43 imps in 7 boards|pg||
nt|garnetts: Very poor auction in the OR--East failing to bid 4@H |pg||
nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
mb|d|nt|cherdano:  East should exit with a high club to do that!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: same contract only -3 OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  esp. when W made a slam try with 4@c bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: usually better to pass initially then act--initial action being a little weaker in good style|pg||
nt|andyv:  some players hate to pass:)|pg||
nt|chick: of course if the boards had been in reverse order, we'd say that NED clawed back their deficit :)|pg||
nt|cindy:  2@h|pg||
nt|don paulus: 2 nt ?n now|pg||
nt|cindy:  nah|pg||
nt|rnmalik: action board:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  (in case declarer has @C6)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: exactly|pg||
nt|haans: also weak openings|pg||
nt|sharynr: and so is North apparently :)|pg||
nt|haans: what an overcall|pg||
nt|2celik1: in 6|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cze salim welcome|pg||
nt|rnmalik: corrected:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: There we go.  That's more like what we expect from jr's.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H NS and some play|pg||
nt|andyv:  they like to play machismo bridge:)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharynr: better than most other bids she made|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: hard to predict pass pass board in this table|pg||
nt|2celik1: hi Gary thank you|pg||
nt|garnetts: No reason for South to even think|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well that is a certainly brave from North--well done|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice bid by N|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1C-1@H-1@S-1nt?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this time i do not believe you:)|pg||
nt|cindy:  i dont really like bidding 2N on that hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  West is tempted to double for takout?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he is thinking|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i would double too|pg||
nt|garnetts: even I might make this one|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well passed S guess hes seen pards weak 2's before:)|pg||
nt|petergill: Team 42 is a good team, from four different countries (Bulgaria from Eastern Europe, Belgium from Western Europe, South Africa and Australia), pehaps the most geographically ...|pg||
nt|petergill: diverse team ever in the history of bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  if he had doubled, EW could get to 4@H|pg||
nt|sharynr: very true, operator|pg||
nt|don paulus: diff with @c lead|pg||
nt|don paulus: 3 nt|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lots of excitement here :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: again NOT an opener, who teaches these kids?|pg||
mb|p|nt|2celik1: so young so much|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this ones is cold|pg||
nt|haans: 15+ for big clubs|pg||
nt|tweety1: puff|pg||
nt|garnetts: which is why West does better to pass intially and then bid--you really do need a system after a multi|pg||
nt|andyv:  if W had his bid, I'd much prefer a dbl by E at this vul than 4@S bid|pg||
nt|don paulus: well ...|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cherdano:  which would probably make|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he passed|pg||
nt|haans: first unusual bid|pg||
nt|don paulus: thought 8 pts was in the max range|pg||
nt|don paulus: what scared him off ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: and south is about to bid 3nt with good spots|pg||
nt|haans: clubs lead?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|cherdano:  North has an easy pass of 2@C|pg||
nt|haans: pass on 2@D are S serious|pg||
nt|haans: that is something to talk about|pg||
nt|don paulus: if not - switch will follow|pg||
nt|garnetts: Just as an aside--the recommended lead is the A@D |pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, it is tough on BBO when you are playing strong players and things don't go your way|pg||
nt|sybarra: werent you ever young Gary, and felt invicible?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: W pls pass|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzus: again 5-1 trumps|pg||
nt|sharynr: South is happy |pg||
nt|haans: no double = no so happy|pg||
nt|sharynr: i predict down 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: need @c T swtch to beat|pg||
nt|haans: clubs T?|pg||
nt|haans: all are going down|pg||
nt|chick: the juniors are fearless :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: let me think...yes I was young once but learnt sound priciples via Charles goren|pg||
nt|sybarra: hey, the wose that happens is you go down....|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @d10 is a nice lead - or?|pg||
nt|chick: 99.9% of the bridge world :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
nt|cindy:  W has no choice|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @DT or @D4 no big difference|pg||
nt|cindy:  N has no choice|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|nigel_k:  3NT should be defeated I think as the defence can set up clubs before declarer can establish a second diamond|pg||
nt|cindy:  i meant 3@h :-)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: E neither|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rnmalik: small a winner here|pg||
nt|sybarra: aha|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 3 better you are saying |pg||
nt|haans: its tough on BBS if you do not have the cards|pg||
nt|haans: BBO|pg||
nt|sybarra: (per a jr.)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: -1|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rnmalik: 3 losers only|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: at least we have youth playing which is a great thing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Es lead was a @d but not the 10|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|cherdano:  so NS will score an easy +130|pg||
nt|iris100:  3@S should go down as well|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cherdano:  where as double would have gotten EW to a making @H partial, or game|pg||
nt|cherdano:  it doesn't usually pay to let opponents play 2@C when you are 5-5 in the unbid suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: played k|pg||
nt|haans: not easy to find|pg||
nt|chick: actually, I don't mind the E opener, honors are top and texture is better than the previous hand we discussed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hey i'm getting great feedback kibitzers @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Cornelia |pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: i assume 1H did show 5 spades|pg||
nt|don paulus: probably transfer|pg||
nt|ybob: 1NT ask how many controls ?|pg||
nt|haans: yes mb|pg||
nt|ybob: not alert ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: 2 h was transfer |pg||
nt|haans: ty|pg||
nt|garnetts: Surely not with three trumps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'll leap wildly with shape or support for pard|pg||
pc|sK|nt|2celik1: and we are in Istanbul on of the excited city on the earth |pg||
nt|don paulus: - 2 ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: do not see how to make now|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|petergill: or at least that is how I felt in the Spingold on BBO the other day being crushed (pleasantly, I have to admit) by Alan Sontag|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: E says sorry partner if i am wrong with double bid|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzus: this is real|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c8|nt|haans: smal clubs = grave error|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|don paulus: S asking @c|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or can she seduce S to hit @HA:)?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cherdano:  EW had no idea how distributional South is|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|nigel_k:  If South just passed a forcing bid she chose an excellent time to do so|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rnmalik: Cannot ruff both hands make it difficult for him|pg||
nt|andyv:  because of 3 trump... with 4, 4@S is automatic, with 3, 800 or 1100 are very real possibilities|pg||
nt|garnetts: WEst should not really have the mountain he has--and 200 or 500 are much more likely|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm afraid that 2Aces and an unsupported K is only 2 quick tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: means you can provide just 2 of the 7 tricks you are bidding for, part needs to provide 3 times as many as you|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: again director is called|pg||
nt|chick: but of course partner can also promote some of your other stuff to full tricks, too |pg||

nt|nigel_k:  As before, an extra trick can eventually be established in diamonds but not hearts|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Since USA Blue can't be caught, they get 1st choice to choose their opponents in the quarter-finals among teams finishing 5-8|pg||
pc|s9|nt|cherdano:  i dont really blame them for giving up this trick|pg||
pc|s8|pc|hT|nt|nigel_k:  Playing on hearts looks like it will limit declarer to eight tricks|pg||
nt|iris100:  itrue|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Also note the excellent choice of a trump as North was marked with short trumps and the ability to ruff clubs|pg||

nt|cherdano:  but here North was so weak (no points in partner's suits) that he shouldn't mind playing 2@C|pg||

nt|garnetts: This is because a blind lead often gives away a crucial trick--so cash and ace to get a look|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: fair enough|pg||

nt|don paulus: 4 @s now|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharynr: 1 think I admire about young players is there very quick decisions|pg||
nt|haans: you came to a GRAND|pg||
nt|don paulus: we saved a grand for you :)|pg||
nt|haans: good opps bidding|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is a lot of spades to bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: Also some practiced pairs reverse their normal lead structure against pre-empts--K from AK and the lead of an ace requires an attitude signal|pg||
nt|sybarra: does he X?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he is thinking|pg||
nt|petergill: in Adams' 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - answer to the ultimate question about the meaning of life = 42, for those even more illiterate than me |pg||
nt|haans: does W let is stand|pg||
nt|andyv:  and you are right...either pass, or dbl and then bid @s would have been better action by W|pg||

nt|petergill: Operator, are you sure that East di not dbl?|pg||
nt|tweety1: very unlucky slam miss other room again..|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  declarer will probably take this trick, cross to a diamond, and take a spade finesse|pg||
nt|garnetts: This argument is a little futile--I will always support when I can rather than double in this situation--and with a small manipulation there is a grand for EW|pg||
nt|jaapfr: were trown away in meantime on 3rd and 4th @D Cindy|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: or "bettering" the contract, same level |pg||
nt|marlowepi: in a sense the N hand does not merit an upgrade, but with both minor tenaces to protect 2N is acceptable. the high card structure of the N hand is esepecially good for suit play, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and if S has a major N wants to be declarer|pg||
mb|r|nt|santyclz: Discussion hand.  In your partnership does the 2@h bid imply @d support or tend to show @d shortage?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I wouldnt  with E east hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes|pg||
nt|haans: if he pass W cannot bid anymore|pg||
nt|chick: 2@C will be limit raise |pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: keeps ops out of 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: i think east should ask rkcb with 4nt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure that 4S did anything to keep them out of 7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: man overboard here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Is west getting desperate ?  4@H ?  |pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Basar|pg||
nt|haans: call it tactical|pg||
nt|ybob: 1NT 2@C 2@H 4@H ?|pg||
nt|chick: which S declines to bid, given his hand full of garbage :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Rdbl = I have a H stop perhaps?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very interesting sequence of bidding|pg||
nt|rnmalik: that shows control|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharynr: another overbid|pg||
nt|haans: but are not W to fault pass on 1@C makeable|pg||
nt|sharynr: was 1@C not forcing?|pg||
nt|haans: maybe all bid are forcing|pg||
nt|sharynr: seems both bids alerted|pg||
nt|haans: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: west always puts cards over board when he is dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: indeed discussion |pg||
nt|haans: are opener bidding all forcing bids|pg||
nt|garnetts: But as you say I am sure we would have managed a little better in practice|pg||
nt|garnetts: Interesting choice 2@S--anyone for what I think is an obvious 2@D |pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: needs to know what this 2 @c alert means..|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: probably could be short|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: they didnt wrote note|pg||
nt|garnetts: To some extent yes--but given limited possibilities 2@D seems to be space saving|pg||
mb|3N|nt|petergill: @HJ - that's good news and bad news, thinks South - the good news is that I'm not doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  giving him 8 tricks|pg||
nt|sharynr: is west the only male at the table?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: eventually:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Difficult to bid, easy to play|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very right|pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: 3 nt makes with @d lead :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: write|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Is W thinking?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  perhaps N was trying to show value of his hand with 2@s bid|pg||
nt|mcarroll: if so got it right|pg||
nt|rnmalik: was|pg||
pc|h2|nt|iris100:  looks like 3@S, 1@D, 2@H and 1@C = just made|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Winning the spade doesn't help as dummy has no entry|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Declarer now has to guess spades though East's opening bid will help|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kiwibridge: excellent J@C|pg||
nt|garnetts: Great card by South|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H first natural bid by opener|pg||
nt|haans: even Big Clubs are changing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and -1 I think!|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: opening 1m could lead to a wrong-sided major suit game |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|tweety1: then 2 @s is not that strong|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|haans: will not like were clubs honor are|pg||
nt|sharynr: she pretty much needs the @CA onside to make, and @D 3-3|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rnmalik: The system they are playing. If 2@D natural then 2@H natural too|pg||
nt|sybarra: since not match points,  why bother with jxx of @D |pg||
nt|garnetts: Well he hasn't got reversing vales with a void in what is liekly to be partner's suit|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Did you meet Masood Salim, his Partner. Walking computer|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we've lost some comparisons in that break|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Not any longer!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kiwibridge: a magnet for the ladies :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: losing finesse |pg||
nt|rnmalik: swing as it is|pg||
nt|sybarra: adding to  NL lead here |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  @hQ now appears to be with West so East needs the @sQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: now she is thinking|pg||
nt|andyv:  it's a reverse, @c void being the negative part|pg||
nt|don paulus: insist on @h and down|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: what a finesse |pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: what was 2S? 3 controls?|pg||

nt|iris100:  right!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: one should  know to count to 9 to make|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzus: west seems upset after looking at dummy|pg||

nt|andyv:  but, can't really comment without knowing what 2@cs was all about.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|don paulus: do not like singelton trump lead - but other leads may give a trick away|pg||
nt|andyv:  otherwise, 2@d seems like the normal bid|pg||
pc|d9|nt|haans: many play 1@H to be semi-relay natural or stronger|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W made a common error at trick one. from KJ(T) the lowest honor is the correct card when suit is led against a suit contract|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s7|nt|cherdano:  well declarer had other ideas|pg||

nt|vugraphzus: after 4nt he can ask extras with 5nt .and he will get @d K for grand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then W should bid 5N as a grand slam try over 5H. not practical to play it specifically as Josephine by 2C opener|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we are playing 10 boards here.|pg||
nt|petergill: so this is a good board for New Zealand (NS)|pg||
nt|haans: natural to bid 4@H going down|pg||
nt|iris100:  next board looks more interesting|pg||
nt|iris100:  4@H by W has some chances|pg||
nt|iris100:  nasty lead for N|pg||
nt|tweety1: then the only reason seems the quality of @s   to be bid.|pg||
nt|tweety1: instead of @d|pg||
nt|garnetts: Odd method--also some case for South responding with 1@S |pg||
nt|andyv:  ty... makes more sense now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good effort both rooms|pg||
nt|marlowepi: playing the ten from KJT allows W to find out who has the queen|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzus: and threw it|pg||

nt|santyclz: Really, e ducked the @s?|pg||

mb|1H|nt|cherdano:  EW should get to 4@H here|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt it |pg||
nt|rnmalik: CR @S lead and no@D finesse 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: @C lead |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6@S looks a go|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sorry - missed the continuation, contract in Open 5@D by EW|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk5: In the other room East wanted to protect his @HK and pulled 6@S to 6NT. That was not a good idea|pg||
nt|Walddk5: @DK put an end to that contract|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But your are right Jaap, that declarer is -1 if W has @ca OR @sK, so it´s safe to cash @hA ane exit with a @c|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|petergill: so the score soon will be 31-12 or 31-8 I think|pg||
nt|garnetts: Looks like a push here in 4@H plus one |pg||

nt|don paulus: very close match - was only 2 pts difference between the teams|pg||
mb|4S|nt|haans: 3@C best bid|pg||
nt|sharynr: agree|pg||
nt|haans: do not understand what 4@S mean?|pg||
nt|petergill: Anticipating 4@H by EW, Norh takes the advance save with a keen eye on the vulnerability|pg||
nt|don paulus: surprising result on board 16 : 6 @s X !|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, N bid 5@d here|pg||
nt|chick: it was still a good thing to consider, even though it didn't work out this time|pg||
mb|4N|nt|sharynr: should not expect a @S fit |pg||

nt|haans: do you agree with that peter?|pg||

nt|rnmalik: 4@S DBL was not bad but 5@C. 4NT for minors|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Everything right for EW in 6@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: west is in tank again|pg||
mb|5C|nt|santyclz: Not that it makes much of an imp difference.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S looks likt transfer to clubs |pg||
nt|petergill: West might take the Dbl as values instead of pure penalty|pg||
nt|petergill: as he has done!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: imo NS here played a more accurate match these first 8 boards|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult as it looks to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 2@C = any game force?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good old gazillie|pg||
nt|don paulus: - 6 = 1400 wins an imp :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i was taught by my wife to say first Sorry and then later to investigate whether i was rite or wrong:(|pg||
nt|chick: S's 2@H bid can be made on 3 hearts and 13 cards|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Nice principle Jaap!|pg||
nt|chick: I think I like your wife already :)|pg||
mb|6H|nt|cherdano:  and meanwhile 5 IMPS to Italy, as North found a more successful @H lead at the other table|pg||
nt|haans: can anyone tell all scores|pg||
nt|iris100:  1@H, 3@C and a spade, thats it for N|pg||
nt|andyv:  less pressure at 4@h on declarer|pg||
nt|garnetts: They were pushed to 5@H next door|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: she did not jump|pg||
nt|sharynr: Once again, a touch too high|pg||
nt|petergill: A good coup by Luke Gardiner, making EW guess, and they have now guessed wrongly|pg||
nt|jaapfr: until b8 i said: now they go overboard:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: but no jumping from E :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: too bad, 3nt would have been better|pg||
nt|don paulus: good action by S|pg||
nt|haans: all i can say is HOLY ...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Still, -200 is better than -620|pg||
nt|rnmalik: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: maybe. 2H going down. in my view it is better and safer to act initially on the S hand|pg||
nt|haans: me 2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: even in this sequence-looking for @S check I think|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 13 imps|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Indeed Rashed|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: looks like Noname have a decent win here barring a disaster on 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: S not wanting N to bid again!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Not easy in the play|pg||
nt|rnmalik: play very important. I thought it was a marked small @H lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzus: passed 3nt |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: strange|pg||
nt|sybarra: that lead doesnt hurt |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: this is quite fun table|pg||
nt|garnetts: will cash AK @H then clubs for 11 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cherdano:  2N 18-19 balalnced, 3@D transfer, 3@S superaccept i assume|pg||
nt|garnetts: slam needs both major suits to break 3-2 with an extra residual chance in spades and the club ace right or led |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: and some more greek speech |pg||
nt|sybarra: that could be right also |pg||
nt|iris100:  but you wont make 4!E from E|pg||
nt|jaapfr: to be honest me too:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but which leaddddddddddddddd?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|andyv:  cash K@h, clear clubs and exit @h|pg||
nt|garnetts: mmaybe not with the unblock|pg||
nt|jaapfr: oh bad luck|pg||
nt|don paulus: didnot both deny @d control ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you call that luck|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cherdano:  after @CAK and seeing the heart break, declarer can endplay South|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: seems that way.i couldnt read notes|pg||
nt|iris100:  4@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: screamed for D lead in my view|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cherdano:  so he won't need the @D finesse|pg||
nt|sharynr: yes, kib suggests a trump back to let declarer do all the owrk|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|iris100:  as N doesnt follow 3 rounds of @D|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yyy|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: The vulnerability was vital to North's decision to bounce the auction. He knew EW have 8+ @H's if South has only 4 spades. |pg||
nt|chick: hehehe|pg||
nt|murat e: can make plus one though same lead in open room|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sharynr: work*|pg||
nt|don paulus: would you then prefer 2 @c over dbl ? with only 3 @s ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably not going to mess around much here |pg||
pc|h4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|don paulus: very close match apart from board 11|pg||
nt|don paulus: sry 12|pg||
pc|d5|nt|nigel_k:  Yes, slightly lucky escape for E/W then|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|nigel_k:  Possibly their defence to 1NT left West with no option other than pass|pg||
nt|chick: yep, a big swing back for NED, although some kibs saying it is a gift, not earned|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Wrong to play @hK! only the @h9!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: must lead a diamond even with a void on that auction|pg||
pc|sT|nt|petergill: Good comeback by New Zealand - they got 800 (the max) for 12 imps on the last board|pg||
pc|s6|pc|hJ|nt|haans: yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i prefer double, since S lacks club ten|pg||
nt|haans: x of 2@H usually mean no spades|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|c3|nt|nigel_k:  Unfortunately the web site is down and we can't see their convention card|pg||
nt|andyv:  simple game sometimes:)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Me too - now it is easier|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rnmalik: of course|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c6|nt|petergill: since with 4/4 in majors South would respond 1@H|pg||
nt|don paulus: call director then :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|iris100:  the web site is down most of the time unfortunately|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|sybarra: hmmm more action at this table!|pg||
pc|c7|nt|haans: an original match|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S hand will play all right in 43 spade fit, at partscore level. |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|haans: from wbf002: usa blue 169ö neth gýrls 146ö neth red 142ö japan-czech 142|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Many pairs now play double as artificial. If West's only alternative was 2NT for minors, pass is more understandable|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They are in 4@S Dbl by NS in Open so suddeenly a comeback by Netherlands and they will now lead|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|cherdano:  10 tricks only|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 26 imp board as 13 the other way if content with 6@S|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: thx David and Basar, thx all specs for your comments, join us again in 90 minutes for another round|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: ty all|pg||
nt|sybarra: and last bd now  |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to Basar our wonderful operator,  great job ! |pg||
nt|haans: 50 minutes to next match|pg||
nt|petergill: Credit that 9 imp gain to Luke Gardiner's daring but sensible tactical bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: thx all last board now.i hope you are enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The defence dropped a trick so 3 imps to N/S|pg||
nt|tweety1: maybe some imps exchanges here:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think the auction next door was dreadful|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to imagine how E/W got to that lovely contract in the OR|pg||
nt|tweety1: Many people opens 1 @c instead of @d with W's hand nowadays... and the only disadvantage is...|pg||
nt|andyv:  even so, I'd pass 1H like a shot with the E hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: Their method needs looking at--personally I do mind the 1@C on a doubleton--but dislike the 1@h rebid--but if you must then also must bid 2@D after 2@C |pg||
nt|tweety1: agree  1nt seems better than 1 h|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, W opened 1@c, which was alerted as 2+... and E showed a preference for @cs|pg||
nt|chick: not totally sure I agree ... E in the other room made a decision to protect his @HK and got unlucky|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is last bd of this set |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: laura is saying " maybe i should bid 5 spades"|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry i get very much comments from spouses|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N makes with inspired club guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: thx all last board of the match|pg||
nt|rnmalik: that is -4|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: I have another in the evening that is my time|pg||
nt|garnetts: Thanks all and have fun--bye for now |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also to Peter and Hans my co commentators. great fun guys! |pg||
nt|ybob: lucky 6@D here|pg||
nt|chick: an imp gain.  USA will be hardpressed to make back 20 imps in one hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: this is the last board of this match.thx all for watching|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@C fine result|pg||
nt|jaapfr: why inspired normal play also ok:)|pg||
nt|don paulus: tx basar - we havenot noticed you - so great job :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Delete that - mixing the teams up again|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: long way to go|pg||
nt|murat e: it was commented that seven clubs on w a major suit squeeze on south|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wait i was wrong no entry to hand|pg||
mb|1H|nt|cherdano:  NS can make grand slam|pg||
nt|cherdano:  in several strains|pg||
nt|cherdano:  but 6@C is the best contract|pg||
nt|sharynr: A multi opening|pg||
nt|garnetts: well after this |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I guess it's lunch time Basar?|pg||
nt|haans: ty :))|pg||
nt|rgdruru: and 6@s|pg||
nt|don paulus: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Information.htm|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well W had already said in the other room that he wanted to play 6S, ie E had no reason to think the heart king needed protection|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Basar as always....great job! |pg||
nt|chick: but it closes the IMP gap, keeping this session exciting :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry, meant as private|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as N had JUMPED to 2@H, there was a fair chance the !A was there, ergo 6NT was an awful bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty also Cornelia and Gary, for your thoughts and insights on these hands |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: last board now.thx all.i hope you enjoyed the show.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzus: last bord was just made.fixed it now|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes its:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  is 3S general strength, or does it show clubs?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: welcome back:)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well Japan_Czech will enjoy theirs :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: yuck --not a great spot |pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to the WBF for organizing and bringing this to bbo   we LOVE seening the jrs. ! |pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, thanks Basar and thanks to the organisers in Istanbul such as Murat Molva and Ata Aydin.  |pg||
nt|chick: it's been done, but they will have to set 6@CXX about 8 tricks|pg||
mb|d|nt|cherdano:  slam will be difficult to find now|pg||
nt|garnetts: but curiously the spades mean it will play OK|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: i agree |pg||
nt|rnmalik: action board again|pg||
nt|murat e: so the most critical board of the match....|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx Basar indeed great|pg||
mb|2H|nt|haans: not available|pg||
nt|iris100:  possible 3SA on the last one|pg||
nt|iris100:  but i think it goes down on a @S lead and @C switch on the third trick|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sharynr: zig and zag|pg||
nt|santyclz: Awfully heavy for a weak jump, maybe intermediate?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx specs for your informative and funny comments, we love them |pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: re-hi|pg||
nt|haans: hi|pg||
nt|petergill: A low heart lead????|pg||
nt|haans: lead low @H = make|pg||
nt|petergill: More daring bidding by NS gives Andy Hung a lead problem|pg||
nt|haans: u first|pg||
nt|petergill: the textbooks say 4th best from this holding|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7@C and 7NT do make in practise but how to bid it:)/|pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: surprising result board 27 !|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: first blood of this match|pg||
nt|don paulus: y|pg||
nt|sybarra: might even have trouble making 4 |pg||
nt|rnmalik: that should be the contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: ak of clubs, ruff, and ace of hts |pg||
nt|rnmalik: less damage|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: ty guys|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 12 imps for that great slam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: last board of this segment|pg||
mb|3H|nt|nigel_k:  A nasty guess in diamonds awaits declarer as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: this is last board of the round thx everyone|pg||
nt|iris100:  but then, you just give up a @D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With @hK and J  on Sthere is also 13 tricks in nt|pg||
nt|chick: especially with N chiming in with a bid|pg||
nt|murat e: now a lightner double beats the grand because east will be on play|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1@S1@H2@D4@C will do|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no I think these are 14's Rashed|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think we play 14 in the Quarter finals?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes 14 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  meanwhile, 3@S would have been down 5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a fun match, next round starts in 45 minutes, thanks Basar great operating and thanks Rashed and Salim|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|petergill: Luke Gardiner did well to make himself declarer - now can he get the clubs right?|pg||
nt|haans: 10-12 nt win lots because opps not know what to bid|pg||
nt|rgdruru: i guess 6 @D i pretty hard to reach, especially after nt opening|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks kibs, best session so far for feedback|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is some serious handhogging by W. lucky that D K is on|pg||
mb|p|nt|rgdruru: not that it should be bid|pg||
nt|haans: nore logical that NT-bidder have @DK|pg||
nt|haans: as logical as @CA|pg||
nt|rgdruru: even so, both 3nt and 6 @D are down if k @D on W|pg||
nt|haans: yep so better slam has been missed|pg||
nt|ybob: S made that opening works|pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: game|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx Basar another great job, Shirley and Cornelia nice to join you again, cheers|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now 7@C down played by N and we order a @H lead:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rnmalik: Gary no swings in borad 10, so Noname comfortable winners:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|petergill: EW lead low = like I think, attitude leads versus NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: wow!   ed |pg||
nt|sybarra: wd |pg||
nt|haans: not better that max 50%|pg||
nt|jaapfr: played by E|pg||
nt|murat e: passssssss|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can not play @DA so must play @DQ and cah her 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|santyclz: The open room reached 5@c on bd 29 on what looks very much like a bidding misunderstanding.|pg||
nt|sybarra: optimist!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rnmalik: @CA|pg||
nt|sybarra: that maybe should have opening lead |pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: its been a good mstch|pg||
nt|haans: match|pg||
nt|chick: wow, this may be close to 20 imps after all|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7@C pls|pg||
nt|imp_jan: fredin dbl by south|pg||
nt|ralfwil: return to 6nt!!!!|pg||
nt|murat e: wow|pg||
nt|imp_jan: return to 7n|pg||
nt|chick: silly double though, never double a contract you can beat unless you can also double and beat anywhere they run to|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but 7nt best XX C:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: fast passes after double.they didnt even think about 7cl or 6nt|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sharynr: opps had to get @C started to defeat a game|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes a good win, have fun later I see you are on with Shirley she is good fun|pg||
nt|haans: time to claim|pg||
nt|chick: they'll pay for it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb they want beer?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The Noname team has a good goalkeeper ....|pg||
nt|jaapfr: cash|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|cherdano:  and maybe double by North would have actually been the best bid|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, 1-1 clubs was indicated by EW's silence in the bidding - with a club void, West might have bid over 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: this is the last board of the match.thx all see you tomorrow|pg||
