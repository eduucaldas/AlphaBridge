mb|d|mb|p!|nt|haans: now we know NS do not play bid club|pg||

nt|jcwla: 2@S-X-3@S-4@H perhaps, nope.|pg||
nt|lestergold: previous han 4/333 hand not an exciting looking slam prospect and not so strong|pg||

nt|han: Hi|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hi Han!|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jaapfr: 5@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this looks like some kind of "club system" response |pg||
nt|bigtrain: x is (not surprisingly) Meckwell, showing one minor OR both majors OR some good hand|pg||
nt|peachy: i think a bit rich for 3rd seat weak two|pg||
nt|roswolf: now 4@H is frisky|pg||
nt|shevek: south didn't bid in OR so west did end up in 3N (previous hand)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: South could double here to show the higher end of the 1NT with weak/short @D's.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: hgeelen has cc: www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/.../molenaar-verbeek.pdf |pg||
nt|cherdano:  with 4-4 in the majors, i would certainly double|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6@D is down on 22 so 13 to USA Blue.|pg||
nt|haans: agree with u there|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|haans: but only 1 down :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: south's bid helped west to find the 3N bid |pg||
nt|sharynr: even if not one's style. the south hand looks like a raise to 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: sorry all some problem here|pg||
pc|h6|nt|han: 1C was probably Polish|pg||
nt|han: often a balanced weak notrump, such as here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk4: Now that East passed 5@H, West will take another bid|pg||
nt|cindy:  thats the kind of hand i like to upgrade to 15|pg||
nt|sharynr: exceptions to rules, can be made|pg||
nt|han: South is light on values for his jump to 2S|pg||
nt|milton_se: otherwise natural or strong|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcwla: 2 is in from OR: 12 more to Neth. Orange for bidding and making 4@H doubled.  |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But it won't be 1660 as one might have feared|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|onebid: now West passes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Are you sure?|pg||
nt|iris100:  looks like itÃÂ´s getting too high|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf: and could make  i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree with cindy. i would either open 1N, or raise 1H to 2H, esp after opening in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|jcwla: KRE puts it at 14.85:  http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
nt|cindy:  has a better chance played from the S hand|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: that should do it for the bidding |pg||
nt|haans: yes maybe|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jaapfr: another 8 imps for Polish i presume|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: i think 1@D is the normal transfer today|pg||
nt|lestergold: diamond barrage has not kept them out of the sensib le contract of 5c|pg||
nt|onebid: I think Liz was right - too much by NS|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks like it :(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but 5@S does make|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think 6@S makes.|pg||
nt|onebid: I do too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I must say that it's tempting to bid again over 4@S with Wilkinson's cards. NV and 5@H will not be expensive if they are allowed to play there|pg||
nt|iris100:  spade position dooms the contract|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in answer to the anti-upgradsers, suppose pd has, e.g.:   AJxxx  Kxx   x   xxxx. you have adequate play for 4S, but you will end in 1N or 2S if you open 1D and rebid 1N|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: needed the diamond force continued i think|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably right Hans |pg||
nt|han: but 5-5 distribution when partner makes a takeout double is good|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|cindy:  low to the @dQ would be fun|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry typo AQxxx of spades|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: diamond may still get it off|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|c2|nt|onebid: but maybe give up after 5@S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Why would he fear that E-W can make slam after a 1-level overcall|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cuttysark: Same Auction the Polish South bid 5@D, which seemed to work better|pg||
pc|c8|nt|haans: did see the dummy did see it|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence could set up a diamond or spade trick to go with the ace of hearts but not both|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5cv of course is safe on a 4/2 heart break whereas 4h might have been shaky on such a break|pg||
nt|cindy:  W would probably not play K and if E has K thats ok too because cant lead @s|pg||
nt|han: now declarer needs to guess how to play the trumps|pg||
nt|han: I cannot imagine that declarer goes wrong|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s8|nt|shevek: current results for the event at:  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Information.htm|pg||
nt|iris100:  should have tried for the crossruff, but it wouldnÃÂ´t have worked anyway - down 2 now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and for those who would not raise 1H to 2H, pd has:   KQT   JTxxx   xx  Kxx. your chances of 4H are good, and you will get there if you raise to 2H, but not if you rebid 1N|pg||
nt|sharynr: club now best|pg||
nt|sharynr: or spade, spade then club|pg||
pc|h9|nt|haans: call giving up|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm not convinced a trump was indicated|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|milton_se: still has a problem in clubs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This was not the best way to handle the contract but he will take 10 tricks|pg||
nt|milton_se: I would go for the H finesse in 1st trick -- knowing that QS is with W if the finesse fails|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and also played a @c from dummy in 2nd or 3rd trick|pg||
nt|han: at the other table South was able to open 2S|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: still thinking|pg||
nt|han: I expect that this showed 5-5 in spades and a minor|pg||
nt|han: the downside of their auction was that they had no idea west had all the important highcards|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: of course, individual hands prove nothing, but IMPs is about the big-ticket items, mainly gamnes, and the hands i have constructed are utterly routine, exactly the sorts of hands ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that swing matches|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|shevek: but you have to be patient , refresh and click on Results, even if seems that's not working|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|milton_se: did he really play the jack?|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now he is down!|pg||
nt|milton_se: yep|pg||
nt|han: no he is not down|pg||
nt|han: he can just ruff and pull trump|pg||
nt|han: with the trumps 2-2 he really cannot go wrong|pg||
nt|han: he can ruff high or low|pg||
nt|han: and just give up a diamond and a club|pg||
pc|sT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|haans: 100% wrong|pg||
nt|ralfwil: correct I was wrong|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jaapfr: in other room it was even unclear for EW who had the slam 6@H or 6@S?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|peachy: unnecessary finesse, although near guaranteed to work|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|iris100:  w pitched a club|pg||
nt|han: this was far from the safest line though|pg||
nt|milton_se: y of coutse|pg||
mc|10|nt|onebid: Here, North might have passed 5@C dbld, but bid again - encouraging partner|pg||

nt|jcwla: Big slam time.|pg||
nt|shevek: 1. USA-BLUE  86; 2. NETHERLANDS ORANGE  81; 3. ITALY RED  80; 4.EGYPT  75|pg||
nt|shevek: sry abt capitals (copy & paste)|pg||
nt|lestergold: delarer should have tackled hearts leaving two trumps in dummy to cater for the entries needed in the event that hearts broke 4/2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I would think the other way|pg||
nt|han: and try to ruff clubs in dummy and diamonds in hand|pg||
nt|milton_se: or ride 10S and then a club|pg||
nt|han: even though east could overruff the club, it would have made on that line as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 4@H a make |pg||
nt|haans: 4@S only 1 down|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w seem to be aggressive - might get to 4@H here|pg||
nt|onebid: Scotland really couldn't find a winning action to compensate for -150 in other room|pg||
mb|1C|nt|cindy:  flushed with success from the previous hand, no doubt|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: interesting board-fighting 3NT for EW|pg||
nt|buffytvs: The 9 IMPs came from Bd 11 -- this room stopped in 3@H while Kevin Fay madae 4@H dbled at the other table|pg||
nt|jcwla: South did double 2@D in the OR, but West persisted with 3@D and made it for a push on 23.|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|haans: spades 5-1 against|pg||
nt|lestergold: interesting bity of a misfit here but as cards lie e/w can make3n|pg||
nt|iris100:  EW are in 3SA in the other room|pg||
mb|1D|nt|haans: 5@C 2 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: would EW bid 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: do not think they go that far|pg||
nt|cherdano:  3@D will make it harder|pg||
nt|cherdano:  but as North just needs a spade control and keycards to bid slam|pg||
nt|peachy: lots of young bridge talent in netherlands, I understand, they have 4 (or 5?) teams in turkey|pg||
nt|jcwla: Whether the N/S @D fit is 8 or 9, E always has the rest.|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: there is 5 netherlands team here|pg||
nt|lestergold: dreadful contract of course|pg||
nt|onebid: On many auctions I would agree, but with nothing to contribute, pass seems logical|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: yes the sac would have been cool|pg||
nt|haans: acceptable|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: but good spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 1 other table N-S +110   1@S  making 2 for +5 IMps Team  42|pg||
nt|sybarra: doesnt look like the table are connected |pg||
nt|cherdano:  he should will move over 4@D|pg||
nt|peachy: thank you operator|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3d the sound spot|pg||
nt|shevek: sry, current results are: 1   USA-BLUE   111;    2   ITALY RED   94|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You play Precision, Liz, please explain 1NT. Did the reverse 1@S and 1NT?|pg||
nt|onebid: Oh dear - I guess I can;'t comment on my choice of opening. Roland still here? lol|pg||
nt|han: North has very nice suits and once south finds the spade fit his hand looks powerful as well|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|jcwla: 3 is in from the OR: 5 more to Neth. Orange after 2@S-P-3@S-swish, making.   E/W never peeped.|pg||
nt|han: the hands fit badly though and 4S went down at the other table|pg||
nt|han: I wonder what 2@s is, any idea operator?|pg||
nt|milton_se: the 4-1 trump break will set it, I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: alerted but w didnt ask|pg||
nt|han: maybe they play a strict form of Walsh, where they would not bid  1@d with a 4-card major unless they had at least invitational values|pg||
nt|han: then 2S could be invitational on this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: here 2NT by E shows 18+|pg||
nt|cherdano:  now he can count 13 tricks|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It looks as if they might.. it is a long time since I played Precision, and I do not know what this pari are up to these days|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|sharynr: that should fail as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: The F-word is still disallowed, Judy :)|pg||
nt|han: surely it is not a standard 2@s because the south hand is far too good for that|pg||
nt|han: now we can only guess|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: and being junior bridge west couldnt resist|pg||
nt|shevek: 3   GREECOURA   93|pg||
nt|onebid: OK:(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: duck and give 2@H to make|pg||
nt|onebid: Not responding 1@S caused the lead to come from East|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 1@H looks fine to me but I fear they may have wrongsided this|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lucky W aint have 3@D|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North must duck and hope he has been a good boy|pg||
nt|onebid: suits up the line sometimes better|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if so it would be always down after this lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i mean the 3@D|pg||
nt|onebid: still, no choice but to duck|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true|pg||
nt|paulg: They don't play "F" and they don't reverse 1@s/1NT, but often start game forcing hands with a forcing 1NT rather than bid naturally .. for some reason|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The trouble is that he might rely on the club finesse to work in order to get rid of a diamond loser. So there is a losing option|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: bidding games on everything is not good bridge|pg||
nt|cherdano:  _she_ can count 13 tricks|pg||
nt|cherdano:  unless her partner has a doubleton club, that would be unlucky|pg||
nt|jcwla: That seems really contraindicated on this auction.|pg||
nt|shevek: 4   EGYPT   91|pg||
nt|shevek: 4.    NETHERLANDS RED   91|pg||
nt|han: but not surprisingly they also end up in 4@s :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: many double nowdays saying nothing about minors|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcwla: WD.|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has only one lay for this contract and he will no doubt roll it in with a PHEW because if tehn diamonds dont behave the contract is going down loads|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or he may try to duck hearts into East to protect @DJ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or not :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: His decision is brilliant|pg||
nt|onebid: Hi Paul@H|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think he will take Roland line|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not any more|pg||
nt|onebid: I think the Liz|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: sorry misscounted E hand :(|pg||
nt|lestergold: hold ur breath finesse and steal the imps my son!!|pg||
nt|shevek: will he take the @d finesse to make the contract?|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has no sane alternative choice|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Very tough. South was declarer in the other room with a spade lead - not so difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: norwegan GF 2nt|pg||
nt|rnmalik: vital entry to W for @H finesse|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this bid doesn't excite South|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but it may be hard to stop now|pg||
mb|p|nt|iris100:  depends on the lead|pg||
nt|sharynr: are any explanations being given operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: sorry no|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think you guys are being too hard on N. ace of spades onside and the hand has great play for game|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I donÂ´t understand 2nt on 6-4 in @c and @s|pg||
nt|han: interesting double|pg||
pc|hA|nt|onebid: but what do I know:(|pg||
nt|iris100:  she doesnt even need the heart finesse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would have no problems with being in game on that hand|pg||
nt|han: east knows that his partner has 4 spades probably|pg||
nt|han: since the opponents advertised their 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|milton_se: good X indeed, know bad breaks in the black suits|pg||
nt|han: and with AK A plus good clubs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: true|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cherdano:  hello everyone|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|haans: loosers 1@H 2@D 1@S|pg||
nt|cherdano:  as predicted South didn't get excited by the 4@S bid|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i believe South already upgraded his hand to a 17-19 balanced|pg||
nt|han: I think this is a very good double|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: He should not have listened to me|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i sympathise with N line anyway |pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|haans: why finessing spades|pg||
nt|iris100:  4@H was better than 4@S on board 2|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course he hates it if its wrong then  dummy's diamonds destined for the scrap yard|pg||
pc|h2|nt|onebid: seems a pure guess|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The club switch theatens his trump control makes it very tough|pg||
nt|sharynr: best lead, but will block when Norths entry is taken out|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|iris100:  W needs to guess the @D position anyway|pg||
nt|sharynr: true|pg||
nt|jcwla: The lead likely gives it away.|pg||
nt|han: declarer may play east for 4 or 5 spades as well as a result of the double|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jaapfr: a very unhappy 4 boards for scots to start with|pg||
nt|iris100:  depends if they play a convention for leads of the 9|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: now its n/s who hate it they know theyv e been robbed blind|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sharynr: but a smooth duck of the @S would have left declarer a guess|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|cherdano:  with 3 aces and trump queen he was worth cooperating over 3@S|pg||
nt|han: very tricky hand to play|pg||
nt|han: I suspect declarer will take the ruffing finesse in clubs now|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|h5|nt|cherdano:  but not more than that|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and downbgraded it again quickly after the 1@S overcall :)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|cherdano:  now declarer is in trouble|pg||
nt|han: declarer probably has high expectations now|pg||
nt|han: on friendlier splits 4S would make|pg||
nt|han: but then, east would not have doubled|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk4: Same this morning. First two boards cost 22 IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: against NL Orange|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3 unhappy, one almost cheerful :)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s6|pc|c9|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|buffytvs: not really -- just gives up a diamond|pg||
pc|d4|nt|iris100:  should be +1 now|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|onebid: exactly!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cherdano:  well if East goes up|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|cherdano:  and plays a spade|pg||
nt|cherdano:  he loses his entry to hand|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jaapfr: now 2 down not @H soon enough|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: UNDER-26 SWISS-KO TEAMS|pg||
pc|s9|nt|cherdano:  since the diamonds are blocked|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk4: 24 IMPs even, 2 x 12|pg||
nt|onebid: needed to ruff that club|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|buffytvs: ah yes -- the diamonds block|pg||
pc|dT|nt|harmon: he ptches on spade|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|shevek: well done|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|han: if declarer had known all the cards he would have made|pg||
nt|han: ruff the heart high at trick 4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|buffytvs: doesnt help - west overtakes and plays more spades|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|pc|d8|nt|han: diamond to dummy and ruff a diamond|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|d9|pg||
nt|jcwla: Again Italy Red will double its lead.|pg||
nt|han: then the trump finesse in clubs|pg||
nt|han: I think you score 10 tricks|pg||
pg||

nt|cherdano:  but West couldnt overtake without setting up @SQ|pg||
nt|cherdano:  as the spades were blocked for the defense|pg||
nt|peachy: Team Scotland has some work to do to catch up|pg||

nt|ralfwil: good analyze Han!|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 6@S for NS here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Information.htm  for the tournament website, but Service Unavailable quite frequently I am sorry to say|pg||
nt|shevek: they collected 7 imps that way :)|pg||
nt|han: sigh, if only I could see all the cards at the table|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: n/s turn to bid game - 3nt?|pg||
nt|onebid: wouldn't you bid over 1NT with the East hand on this one?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  NS got to 7@H in the other room, so the grand will be a push|pg||
nt|jaapfr: what where when judy:)?|pg||
nt|onebid: in open room, I meant|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|haans: lot of slepping computers|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Team from Pakistan is also participating in this championships and all the players are below 20|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: 3@d =6@s+4@c 14+|pg||
nt|buffytvs: guess I need more coffee :)|pg||
nt|haans: i di belive 4@H|pg||
nt|onebid: West is just kidding??|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Probably - but I am not convinced it is winning bridge with this suit and a stiff ace|pg||
nt|iris100:  Italy red is taking revenge for Italy green's defeat in the previous match|pg||
nt|cindy:  would expect to make many (6) @hs but look at the split |pg||
nt|han: 2@s shows a gameforcing hand, typically with 4+ @s and 5+ @d|pg||
nt|han: I would bid 2NT with the south hand|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|milton_se: or 1NT :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: What is 1@S?|pg||
nt|peachy: Jordan, do you know the NS system?|pg||
nt|haans: they can count|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=6  for standings after round 6. First 8 after 13 rounds advance to the quarter-finals on ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tuesday|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jcwla: Just when you think you can count 12 tricks...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: handy on this hand |pg||
nt|ralfwil: But there is a good reason to play according to tour plan. With a 4-card @s he had played Trumps instead of 3 rounds of @h|pg||
nt|han: well yes, 1NT would be better but unfortunately illegal|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cherdano:  @D lead looks normal with the South hand?|pg||
nt|cherdano:  natural i assume|pg||
nt|haans: but 3nt is better|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt very hard to find|pg||
nt|roswolf: the lady fixes the contract but perhaps science needed to be used|pg||
nt|haans: would you have bid 3nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  @C also possible|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yecch.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: USA Blue in a league of their own it seems|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Dbl is probably some fancy defence to the strong club - maybe a 1-suiter?|pg||
nt|paulg: Precision 1@c, pass is 0-4(5)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: first Bulletin can now be read on http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Bulletins.htm|pg||
nt|haans: sort of insult not supporting p|pg||
nt|onebid: 5-3-3-2 not a one suiter in many systems, lol|pg||
nt|milton_se: Ds 3-3 will make this an easy game|pg||
nt|han: I don't know what 3C showed|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ralfwil: 4-suit I think|pg||
pc|c5|nt|buffytvs: so far each board has swung 9 IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: strong club, Precision|pg||
nt|han: I don't see any use to that bid on this auction|pg||
nt|han: the auction is already gameforcing|pg||
nt|han: you have a balanced hand and stoppers both in clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|han: besides, 2NT is cheaper, allowing more room for partner to describe his or her hand|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cuttysark: When you just have to find a bid of some kind.....|pg||
nt|onebid: especially at these colors|pg||
nt|onebid: declarer won't find the diamond pitches with no dummy entry|pg||
nt|cindy:  anyone bid 3@h over 2@d ?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|roswolf: well pard bid 1nt and north has a lot of soft values - yes i think 3nt has merit|pg||
nt|haans: yes but would you?|pg||
nt|roswolf: but may have been able to offer a choice of games|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes i would|pg||
nt|haans: ok |pg||
nt|jcwla: me|pg||
nt|iris100:  lucky escape by both EWs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: only if breathing|pg||
nt|sharynr: West will shake his head when dummy hits, but smile at trump pulling time|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cuttysark: South has a real problem. best to stay passive with a red suit, but hard for him to see that|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes :)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i predict this board will swing less :)|pg||
nt|cherdano:  if 1@S was natural the lead could have worked very well|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|cherdano:  tempting declarer to duck twice with Kxxx in dummy|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|han: east played the club queen at trick 1|pg||
nt|han: this is often a good play when you hold AQx in third seat (against notrump!)|pg||
nt|han: imagine declarer with Kxx of clubs|pg||
nt|han: and partner with six clubs to the jack|pg||
nt|han: if you play the ace|pg||
nt|han: and then the queen|pg||
pc|s6|nt|han: declarer can hold up twice|pg||

nt|cindy:  now the smiling|pg||
nt|iris100:  one more IMP to Italy|pg||

nt|vugraphzur: yes he s|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: is|pg||

nt|cindy:  depending on what my partner likes |pg||

nt|onebid: now club|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1 imp still winning by going down 1|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|onebid: never mind - didn't see ace cashed:(|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|han: then, if partner has no entries as here, he can never enjoy his club tricks|pg||
nt|han: but if you play the queen at trick 1, it is very hard for declarer to hold up|pg||
nt|han: since west might have the ace and if you hold up, you don't get any club tricks!|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|peachy: West counting hands, I can hear it :)|pg||

nt|roswolf: hmm trap hand now|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  this may be a swing to france, as East can hardly make 1N on a @D lead|pg||
nt|haans: look at E diamonds|pg||
nt|haans: is that fair|pg||
nt|roswolf: impressive - no!?:)|pg||
nt|iris100:  grand slam time|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another easy 4@s|pg||
mb|1C|nt|marlowepi: sad to have ths S hand at favorable and be stuck in 4th chair :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzur: sory for inconvenience some technical problem here|pg||
nt|shevek: I hope 2@c is not for the Majors !|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now a Scottish chance here: to make 2@S C|pg||
nt|iris100:  still can do some damage|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|haans: 4@S just about|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@d looks like a pass/ correct bid|pg||
nt|shevek: south would like to dbl as a tko of @d....|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes  i like 3@s|pg||
nt|iris100:  good dieter!|pg||
nt|cindy:  is 4@h auto ?|pg||
nt|han: yes, the hands have been fairly flat so far|pg||
nt|milton_se: the problem might be to avoid 6|pg||
mb|2C|nt|cherdano:  NS open very light as you can see - playing strong club helps for that|pg||
nt|jcwla: Both pairs made ten tricks in @H's so a push on 25.|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: W has a really hard bid over 3S|pg||
nt|cindy:  i agree, marshall|pg||
nt|han: indeed, if south chooses the reverse|pg||
mb|2H|nt|shevek: maybe 2@c was 1-suited hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: potential trouble here though...|pg||
nt|cherdano:  this looks like 9 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: can get really dirty|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: 2@C was Majors|pg||
nt|shevek: well....|pg||
nt|shevek: hard to describe that hand as Majors|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It may take a heart lead to make it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but 4H is the best non-unilateral bid to get pd excited. now 5N is easy|pg||
nt|han: north would have a hard time stopping below 5@s (playing RKC they would find the missing keycard and @sQ)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Bertil but not any longer I think|pg||
nt|milton_se: 3S now?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jaapfr: @DT awful|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Gyles Ellison led @D10 in the other room, as did West here now|pg||
nt|onebid: not a fan of doubleton leads, but......|pg||
nt|jaapfr: for declarer :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: are we not obliged to favor the team trailing by 30-1?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I cannot endorse a lead from 10x, even when it works!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: has to be a bit careful.  might bring it home|pg||
nt|haans: i would prefer a clubs finesse|pg||
nt|cherdano:  East maybe double this for penalties?|pg||
nt|cherdano:  no he did not|pg||
nt|buffytvs: doubt that dbl would be for penalties|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is defeatable|pg||
nt|haans: how forcing is 4@D?|pg||
nt|cindy:  the 4@s bid by N sort of hurt their chances on keeping them out of slam|pg||
nt|iris100:  E doesnÃÂ´t know abot the @S void|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 5N was obvious to me unless 5C could have been a singleton|pg||
nt|milton_se: now they're probably safe|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cherdano:  nor is it clear that a penalty double would be a success|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Ruff a @D and lose 2@S, 1@H, 1@D.|pg||
nt|jcwla: On Board 4, where N/S here went down 3 in 3NT, the OR N/S bid all the way up to 6@D, which was doubled and down one.  3 more to Neth. Orange.|pg||
nt|roswolf: gf i should hope|pg||
nt|haans: but what should S bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D seems to be the spot they are heading for|pg||
nt|han: this is very timid bidding by Roussos|pg||
mb|4N|nt|bigtrain: @SQ would have been more effective here than the last hand  :)|pg||
nt|cindy:  he really wouldnt know if N hand passed but not sure that is realistic|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree--4S was worse than a waste of time|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: right :)|pg||
nt|haans: please no more clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello|pg||
nt|roswolf: south can pass this but should he|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! no reverse on 15 and only 2@s over 2@h|pg||
nt|milton_se: now he's compensating!|pg||
mb|5C|nt|cherdano:  it would make for a nice first trick|pg||
nt|cherdano:  but you still have to play to trick two :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: double is growing|pg||
nt|haans: S bid nt so NT down 2|pg||
nt|jcwla: OR sac'd in 7@S over 7@H.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 4nt is not so good. 5@s is better|pg||
nt|han: this is what you might call an impossible auction|pg||
nt|milton_se: this is where underbidding may lead|pg||
nt|han: similar to 1NT-3NT-4NT|pg||
nt|han: 2C limited his hand|pg||
nt|han: so south should respect his partner's decision to stop in 4@s|pg||
nt|han: north made no attempt for slam, as far as I know|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and itÂ´s all about the @s quality|pg||
nt|han: I imagine 5@s showed 1/4 keycards|pg||
nt|han: and south can now ask about the spade queen by bidding 5@d|pg||
nt|han: that would keep them out of slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Han, thatÂ´s a way to avoid slam|pg||
nt|han: but 5@s is already a very uncomfortable contract, and they would deserve to go down 1|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|haans: need thinking|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S does not even take keycard away from opps|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes|pg||
nt|sharynr: he gambled on 1st round @s ctrl|pg||
nt|iris100:  and won|pg||
nt|ralfwil: He listened to you!|pg||
mb|5S|nt|cherdano:  it seems like this will be down 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: north is thinking of bidding 6 - she shouldnt since she has shown her hand already|pg||
nt|roswolf: east is a wimp|pg||
nt|haans: she was in slamming mode from the start we all been there|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|onebid: with me, it's almost a pre-alert - she almost never leads one|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  not too much of a gamble|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it was barely a gamble at all with N providing so much gratuitous information |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: with a little help|pg||
nt|haans: i have looked for 42 but found nothing|pg||
nt|han: I would have made a reverse with the south hand, what do you think Bertil and Ralf?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|han: not if partner responds 1@h, only if partner bids 1@s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Me too! reverse ans a weak @s support|pg||
nt|han: a kibitzer suggests opening 1NT with the south hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcwla: N/S have had more of the hands here than in a bridge column.|pg||
nt|han: it is not the strangest idea|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|onebid: hmmm|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|haans: @DA was a good help|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Bd 14 swung 12 IMps, not 9 :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|cherdano:  on a penalty double and the same lead|pg||
nt|haans: still looks like a make|pg||
nt|shevek: play the J for 3 imps in?|pg||
nt|shevek: or the 9 for another flat board?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|cherdano:  North may just take his 4 top tricks and two club ruffs for seven tricks|pg||
nt|buffytvs: where NS here stopped in 5@H, the French stopped to double EW in 2@S and picked up 1100|pg||
nt|milton_se: I would bid just 2C but 3S over 2H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharynr: what? you never raised pard preeempts on less than 3 card support!?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|jaapfr: only if trump A and expectation to find pd again the  Tx looks more attractive than usual |pg||
nt|onebid: this defense has stumbled though|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5 IMPs to Scotland it seems. The defence wasn't the best I think it's fair to say|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

mb|p|nt|bgn: low @C lead leaves him with no real chance I think|pg||

nt|cuttysark: I don't see 9 tricks - not that I'm complaining, you understand|pg||
nt|cindy:  seems to me leading a @s is a big waste of time too|pg||
nt|jcwla: 7@SX is looking like 1400 in the OR, so 13 more to Italy Red.|pg||
nt|han: at matchpoints you might play a spade to the jack, hoping for KQx onside|pg||
nt|han: (declarer had the 8 as well!)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I have a lot of kibs talking about 6@c! a nice slam!|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: He had them in the end. Diamond up after drawing trumps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for W not to be void, 3S has to be on a 6-card suit & 4S had to be a doubleton. it can happen, but it is a pretty small parlay. thus the word "barely"|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 42 are very young |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Jacob and Hans |pg||
nt|cherdano:  another automatic opener for NS|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this hand may be stretching light openings too far|pg||
nt|cherdano:  playing a strong club i don't see any problems with opening balanced 10 counts|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S is soon slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4s is not quite as easy|pg||
nt|han: however, here you shouldn't try to lose only 1 trick, rather to avoid losing 3 tricks|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: we now have the rooms connected :)  wd |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 club?|pg||
nt|cherdano:  3@C probably shows both minors|pg||
nt|buffytvs: when the suit you open is dbleton KJ? an aceless 8-loser wonder?|pg||
nt|cherdano:  getting to 3N looks more normal|pg||
nt|shevek: true|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tell me how you find 11 tricks here:)|pg||
nt|onebid: for heart pitch|pg||
nt|iris100:  not if youÃÂ´ve got the @SA to cash ;-)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|haans: its the first day in school|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I was searching, but in vain|pg||
nt|han: so you should think about possible 4-1 breaks, and how to avoid losing against those|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|onebid: it's 11 hcp and 1@D doesn't guarantee diamonds|pg||
nt|cherdano:  well it doesnt show diamonds, it shows a balanced 10-13|pg||
nt|haans: well done here|pg||
nt|sharynr: kib made good point though, 6@c denies spade ace, so 6@D should not be bid without|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: in my book 4@C is cue |pg||
mb|2C!|nt|haans: got that right|pg||
nt|cherdano:  here the opening propel EW too high|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no, I think EW did that to themselves|pg||
nt|cherdano:  of course, it would have been NW who are too high if East had made a penalty pass|pg||
nt|cherdano:  but with KQx of trumps, that wasnt so easy to find|pg||
nt|buffytvs: wasn't 3@C a diamond raise?|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i _think_ it shows both minors|pg||
nt|harmon: probably fit showing cause Justin always throws fits anyway|pg||
nt|cherdano:  Matt Meckstroth confirms, 3@C shows both minors, less than invite|pg||
nt|lestergold: can lose two spade tricks a heart and a diamond in 4s whereas no probs in 4H|pg||
nt|shevek: declarer would have to guess @s|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think 3@C is 5-card Stayman|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Is 3@C a modern variation of Stayman?|pg||
nt|cindy:  im not a big fan of this double|pg||
nt|han: and you see that small to the jack is a big mistake|pg||
nt|han: you would lose against a singleton Q or K offside|pg||
mb|2N|nt|cherdano:  successful lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: i wouls bid 4@S as north and pard would pass !|pg||
nt|onebid: puppet likely|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Liz answered the question|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i see a @C a@D and a @H as minimum for defense here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well, there goes the club?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  if declarer ducks to West's king, West can shift to the @CT|pg||
nt|lestergold: however it lookslike they will p-lay this in the sounder 4/4 fit rather than the 6/2 fit|pg||
nt|iris100:  getting desperate|pg||
nt|ralfwil: you can only solve a 4-1 berak in front so -yes|pg||
nt|han: declarer ducked first|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rnmalik: good pass by N-makeable +1|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: @CA and another|pg||
nt|haans: not right if clubs 3-1|pg||
nt|harmon: Meckstroth?? that name sounds familiar|pg||
nt|jcwla: 5 to Scotland on Board 5.  They went down 1 in 2NT here while Neth. went down 3 in 3NT in the OR.|pg||
nt|onebid: at least he didn't lead doubleton diamond:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  true Harmon :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Or @H10 :)|pg||
nt|han: if east had had a singleton K or Q, he would have played to the jack later|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cherdano:  he is their teammate|pg||
nt|cherdano:  and sitting out this round|pg||
nt|cindy:  what is e/w notrump range ?|pg||
nt|han: what I am saying actually doesn't hold since west played the 9 and declarer had the 8 :)|pg||
nt|han: back to this hand|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|jcwla: Surprisingly quiet E/W bidding here -- will serve them well.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: spec says nht losers can go on clubs in 4s not if club switchcut declarer off from dummy tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: my|pg||
nt|han: I wonder what the double of 1NT was, did it show a good hand, or was it a support double perhaps?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cherdano:  this seems down 3 now|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S may be big winner|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: little break here|pg||
nt|haans: how many of you had ever bid 4@C after 3@S because you want to play clubs? not many im sure|pg||
nt|haans: also a place for asking bids|pg||
nt|cindy:  just asking because it looks like 1N to me|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cherdano:  here declarer could have blocked the suit by ducking @C9|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: still a make|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i suppose West meant redouble as SOS, or doubt-showing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I hope you guys are never dealt doubletons|pg||
nt|Walddk4: do you always have 4333?|pg||
nt|onebid: Liz and I won't lead'em|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Fortunately we cannot have four doubletons|pg||
nt|onebid: LOLOL|pg||
nt|jaapfr: girls or guys:)?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|shevek: at the other table declarer played @hA, then small to Q which is the correct play to lose 1 trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer has much to worry about here he doesnt know hts and clubs ar behaving so well|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: she is still thinking|pg||
nt|lestergold: she is it?|pg||
nt|han: given the 2NT bid by south, I suspect it was a support double because if it showed a good hand south would have forced to game|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|iris100:  because of the badly judged interference by N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: everything looks like 1N to you cindy :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cindy:  oh i forgot !  of course|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|onebid: we're all guys here, Jaap|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yvonnebrid: yes, it is marion|pg||
nt|han: unless he sees the heart split before he has to guess the spades :)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|cherdano:  West did well to keep the club layout unclare with the @C9 continuation|pg||
nt|lestergold: marion will be disappointed with that finesse another diamond is quite a threatening defence|pg||
pc|c4|nt|harmon: he wanted to get to the 4 level??|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cherdano:  the @H shift destroyed NS' communication|pg||
nt|buffytvs: East probably had doubts too, but nowhere to run either|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i like 1NT also at these colors, because of the trip spade. if your auction goes 1H-1S, you are poorly placed on the second round. but with 5 spades you will always find spades by ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: opening 1N|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: when all tgye side suits are finished often best to give ruff and discard to weaken trump position|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it happens i dont think a sledgehammer  would beat this|pg||
nt|shevek: if she thinks cross ruff, then she'd have to cash @cQ 1st anyway..|pg||
nt|han: usually with K10xx and AQx it is best to play the spades from the top|pg||
nt|han: however, if west has shown length in two other suits, it makes finessing much better|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d2|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|shevek: all lines work|pg||
nt|lestergold: we can see that as is often the case|pg||
nt|milton_se: this is why I don't like support Xs -- showing values instead would open for a penalty|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||
nt|han: but when you see that the hearts split 5-1.. the drop probably is better again, I don't think that west has to be 5-5 on this auction|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jcwla: Would you double as E?|pg||

nt|peachy: i would be tempted but prob not|pg||
nt|peachy: particularly opposing Precision players|pg||
nt|peachy: 4H could have been many types of hands|pg||
nt|roswolf: it should be a relay cue in that you ask opener to cue bid singletons or voids and is forcing to 5 of the trump suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The closed room result now is a score you should never see at IMPs, but you do, sadly|pg||
nt|onebid: action!|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: e/w nt range is 15-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Better @C play by Lall in other room but chose to work on @H's rather than @S's and ended up the same down two for another push.|pg||
nt|haans: a passibility|pg||
nt|onebid: West had awkward decision over 2@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you could miss hearts, true, but then maybe deal belongs to opps|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|cherdano:  1@C = 16+|pg||
nt|haans: po|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The old weak 2-suited two opener does not seem to have reached Junior Scotland yet|pg||
mb|d|nt|cherdano:  1@H = 8-11 |pg||
nt|onebid: Perhaps should have opened the bidding?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: double is very dangerous. I would have preferred 2NT, two places to play, if I re-open|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still as E after p-2@S-p-p-X-p-?? what to do then Roland??|pg||
mb|p!|nt|cherdano:  (i assume)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Read above|pg||
nt|ritong: ellison bros bid conservatively|pg||
nt|cuttysark: That would solve his problem. Why not? Good suits, easy rebid...|pg||
nt|onebid: Yes, Roland has the answer !|pg||
nt|ritong: they stayed backline all set long|pg||
nt|jaapfr: agree but when pd X as E i do pass as well|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cuttysark: I also agree that the double is not good - spade void makes it likely partner will pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: u r correct |pg||
nt|roswolf: double is cute here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|haans: 42 taking the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  now if East keycards|pg||
nt|cherdano:  West can show his hand completely|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|haans: often invite to game in spades|pg||
nt|onebid: you certainly will pass|pg||
nt|han: again, 1C shows either clubs, a balanced hand with 12-14 HCP, or any strong hand|pg||
nt|han: double is just takeout of clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cherdano:  West opts for a stopperless 1N bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2d by unpassed hand should be forcing in imps game|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|cherdano:  rather than 2@H with a flat hand and a 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: W beat him to keycard|pg||
nt|han: and double followed by 1NT showed a balanced hand to good for a direct 1NT (if they play this as natural)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cherdano:  not clear what the best line for declarer is|pg||
nt|lml: hi there|pg||
nt|harmon: uh oh Linda is here|pg||
pc|c5|nt|buffytvs: moral support :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: it was here it seems|pg||
nt|haans: they did that right|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|shevek: it was at the other table|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cherdano:  i see 4@S was keycard|pg||
nt|cherdano:  knowing they are limited to 32 hcp, West doesn't try for grand - will be disappointed to find perfect cards with East|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6 a push at 3NT-2.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|haans: but the have a lot to do|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcwla: Same contract in OR -- hard to find out about the 5 @D tricks -- yet another push.|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: meckstroth says 'sorry my fault'|pg||
nt|sharynr: no success expected here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow what does 2C then 2N show?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|iris100:  would you open the W hand with 2@C|pg||
nt|sharynr: this is the 2nd auction where they did that. must be 18-20|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i gues sit depends what 2C then 2N shows|pg||
nt|sharynr: see bd 14...|pg||
nt|iris100:  good save against 4@D by NS|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: this seems like an overly cheerful auction|pg||
nt|buffytvs: exuberant I would say|pg||
nt|cherdano:  2N by East would have been enough|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think once West responded East was never letting him out|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i guess some would suggest that West should pass with 5 hcp, but since I know I would bid 1@H i won't criticize him for bidding :)|pg||
nt|lml: well 2NT is the book bid|pg||
nt|lml: yes he has aces but he is 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|lml: +1 and -1|pg||
nt|cuttysark: At least North did not lead his 10x|pg||
nt|jaapfr: traumatic:)?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, there is no damage control when you have to match 470|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|cherdano:  4333 and 3 jacks|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|milton_se: the hunt for the 7th trick starts ...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|haans: cross ruff|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rnmalik: @C shif would have created some problems|pg||
nt|onebid: you have to have sympathy for this NS - they don't get to play 2@SX|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lml: but then add a point or two for youth|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: altho 3n did go off in open room- its not an unreasonable contract to reach combined 24 with two 5 card suits and fair inmtermedoates all suits stopped|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And it is hard to see a good defence to this heart contract|pg||
nt|jaapfr: here the muiderberg 2 openings did work in both rooms|pg||
nt|han: and declarer has already won :)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|sharynr: without this 2@C opening, it may start 1@H DBL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: love it when one player opens 2C and their side bid smoothly to game against silent opps, and hand belongs to opps :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|jcwla: 7 to Austria for bidding and making 3NT on 17.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: @H lead to J and then after entry with @SK kill |pg||
nt|onebid: Still, opening 1@H best describes your hand if that isn't available|pg||
nt|jaapfr: polish=muiderberg in this respect tx paul:)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|harmon: does better by going after hts|pg||
nt|lml: I think he was hoping that the C!K was onside and the H!K|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|dA|nt|buffytvs: scoring average has gone down -- only 8 IMPs per board now|pg||
nt|lestergold: im sure south intended her bid as forcing partnership needs to sort out this area|pg||
nt|cindy:  lol|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lml: @CK and @HK|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i would have played a club to the king at trick 2|pg||
nt|haans: OR same bidding but only 3@S|pg||
pc|c6|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lml: he could make his diamond|pg||
pc|c8|nt|shevek: 3NT should've made, declarer didn't play it very well|pg||
nt|lestergold: played by south tio protect the clubs 3N has a good chance of coming home|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: odd that W did not pull 3 trumps before leading D (or whatever)|pg||
nt|sharynr: When I was very young, (a billion years ago) I opened 2NT with a complete yarborough... and EVERYONE passed!|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lml: too and maybe even four hearts|pg||
nt|cindy:  3N worked out great|pg||
nt|sharynr: The opps had 19 opposite 19!|pg||

nt|ritong: sry:)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: More roulette|pg||
nt|jaapfr: same problem at different level is: we Dutch think we invented whist and were the inventors of bridge:) |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Impossible not to make 4@H. Now you just need to bid it|pg||
nt|cindy:  too funny|pg||
nt|iris100:  ;-)|pg||
nt|sharynr: youths have more nerve...|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: a non vul 2 suiter |pg||
nt|haans: thats a new one|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: in NL  they call it Muiderberg |pg||
nt|cherdano:  still West can confirm keycards|pg||
nt|jcwla: 7 a push at 4@H making.  OR North opted to use Jacoby 2NT and South rebid 4@H.|pg||
nt|milton_se: very precise 2-0, 2-2, 8-2, 8-8 :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: with that weak hand?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think Verbeek is looking for some action here  |pg||
nt|bigtrain: normal precision it's easier...  E makes a @D positive then W can visualize grand|pg||
nt|cherdano:  confirm having all keycards, and sometimes East can just bid 7 on a spade or club trick source|pg||
nt|cherdano:  2@D showing a good heart raise|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some play that bidding 6 says a keycard is missing.|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s need to play this in 3N north may worry about diamonds but probably best just to punt it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: u can do that in canada. here trhey bust your kneecaps, this is america|pg||
nt|cindy:  hqhq|pg||
nt|jcwla: Light opener here...|pg||
nt|iris100:  3rd seat|pg||
pc|hT|nt|han: I imagine that it was west who was thinking, not south|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: or maybe it is just a 5 card (very) wk 2 |pg||
nt|haans: 3@H better than normal with @H|pg||
nt|lml: now vulnerable and with a 6 card suit this time I bid lots|pg||
nt|cherdano:  and this time it would be successful, too|pg||
nt|lml: yes :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: This looks like Puppet.|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh i feared this|pg||
nt|lestergold: now soutgh will think north is worried about spades|pg||
nt|shevek: they seem to be having a conversation...|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@s by south?|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u if 3n means i havent got spades but have got diamodns then all will be ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5c can make of course as cards lie|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 3n much more comfortable|pg||
nt|shevek: obviously north failed to bid 3NT because he thinks slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: the ten of dimaonds is the key card and its favourable|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, W had a light opener but passed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N just showed he was breathing|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: do you agree to such opening when P is not a passed hand|pg||
nt|cherdano:  so 2@D promised 3 hearts and 8+ points to be precise|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it depends on the meaning of the 3c raise- in modern stykle its unusually weakish|pg||
nt|iris100:  would not open the W hand red in second position |pg||
pc|h6|nt|buffytvs: wimpy pass|pg||
nt|shevek: she found the bid |pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree|pg||
nt|sharynr: i agree|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|buffytvs: 'look for reasons to bid, not reasons not to bid'  D. Colbert|pg||
nt|jcwla: Nothing to talk about there.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: donmt as and we wont tell you|pg||
nt|cuttysark: There is no save|pg||
nt|cindy:  i think W has to bid over 1@s|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|cherdano:  what did this double show?|pg||
nt|haans: tricky to make|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S much better|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|haans: playing with weak hands trumf|pg||
nt|roswolf: easier to go off than to make i think|pg||
nt|haans: W did open weak "@S in OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3s was kit telling or asking it wasnt fourth suit!|pg||
nt|shevek: it was right there in the bidding box :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: well this lead will not hurt|pg||
nt|ritong: right R  only a backwards finesse maniac can fail here|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lml: remember that old joke about my nose runs and my feet smell|pg||
nt|cherdano:  East has a nice stopper and a 6-card suit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: if matt has similar agreements to his dad...  2@D shows exactly 3@H and about 6-9 dummy points|pg||
nt|jcwla: OR is also playing 3@S.|pg||
nt|cherdano:  North bid 3@S in the other room instead of 2@S|pg||
nt|jcwla: Perfect Snapdragon double here for W.|pg||
nt|cindy:  yep|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cherdano:  2@S doesnt look like enough to me either|pg||
nt|roswolf: playing to ruff a club should work|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lml: he is upside down|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: so snapdragon promises 5?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|haans: and now only on a @D finesse|pg||
nt|haans: even without dutch 4@S are easy to find|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|haans: i call it dutch shotrre that M...|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes and a doubleton in partner's suit|pg||
pc|c4|nt|han: the vugraph operator may not see the tray with the bids until both south and west (screenmates) have bid|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cherdano:  and if the 6-card suit doesn't runn|pg||
nt|milton_se: he can only hope for KC with West as well as the aces|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: throw in also called nedplay possoble|pg||
nt|haans: endplay|pg||
nt|bigtrain: N does have alot of losers and knows his patrtner is somewhat limited|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|cherdano:  2NT might be down too|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bigtrain: personally i think 2@S is about right|pg||
nt|jcwla: Ditto.|pg||
nt|cherdano:  limited due to the opponents' bidding?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes|pg||
nt|jcwla: I know some people play 4+ @H's on this auction but most play five.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lml: beside it is a VUL game|pg||
nt|lml: you should bid it if it sniffs at you|pg||
nt|bigtrain: and more than half his values won't contribute to offense|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: easy|pg||
nt|lml: the one he bid was a NV game|pg||
nt|cherdano:  but i think game will be good opposite many minimum takeout doubles with 4 spades|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk4: If any declarer really played for the heart suit to be dealt  Qxx    10   by advancing the jack, he might be accused of having the hand records|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|cherdano:  @SATxx and AK in one minor - ok these are perfect cards maybe|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or needing to visit a therapist|pg||
nt|ritong: and also to have forgotten to play K first|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d2|nt|bigtrain: bidding game on hands like this will more likely lose 6 IMPs than win 10|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes if it promises 5 then it is best. otherwise 2H|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d4|nt|jcwla: All of S's choices have worked out as poorly as possible.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 8 a push at 3@S making.|pg||
nt|haans: doing well here|pg||

nt|sybarra: and thx to Hans and Rashed for comments and insights,  we appreciate your time |pg||
nt|lml: the dreaded multi|pg||
nt|jcwla: As we approach the end of this match, a big thank you to our excellent vugraph operator, to Roland Wald, to Walter Johnson, to Arend Bayer, and to all specs.|pg||
nt|onebid: now there's a result!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last board of the match now. Many thanks again to Ozgur Kanli, our very capable operator in Istanbul. Well done!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: what a lucky  3nt with 6 tricks for defense\|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Also thanks to my excellent fellow commentators: Liz McGowan, Judy Bramley and Jaap Frijling|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we have had 3 I think in this session|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also to the organizers for bringing us the Youth Congress,   we will be busy on bbo for many days |pg||
nt|vugraphzur: see you @@ 16:00 o'clock at local time 35 minutes later|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks Shirley, Haans and our operator. It ia a pleasure.|pg||
nt|lml: when I was playing a few days ago at a tournament in North American I practically got booed for playing it|pg||
nt|peachy: this will be another likely push at 3n|pg||
nt|lestergold: we see that e/w in open reached a very junior 3N|pg||
nt|lestergold: absurd really because the spade lead was guaranteed|pg||
nt|shevek: well, it worked in bd 24 :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2d is atrociopus|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: this is the last board of this round RR7 will start about half hour later|pg||
nt|shevek: they're young Mike|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Finally, our appreciation to the WBF and TBF for ensuring that this wonderful inaugural event is brought to BBO vugraph. Murat Molva, Ata Aydin and Cengiz Arigun have been ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: instrumental in setting up a fine show for the whole world to watch. Much appreciated!|pg||
nt|onebid: and also thanks to Paul for giving us info on system|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sounds like a hacker attack.|pg||
nt|cindy:  ive never heard of it showing six|pg||
nt|iris100:  slam on the last board - not a very good one though|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: a weak 2 with two ks outside but nothing in ur suit is not my idea of sound bridge especially in second piosition|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: ur bids should always be sound in 2nd of course|pg||
nt|shevek: born after 1 January 1984 (Under-26 category)|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: the last round of the day will start in 45 mins later|pg||
nt|paulg: I'm not sure I'd give a positive on that club suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W passed another light opener :)|pg||
nt|han: as the difference is very small, the IMPs on this hand decide on a lot of victory points|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jcwla: My partners always bid @D's when I make this kind of double.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I am sorry,  I must dash to an appointment,  I will see you later :)  |pg||
nt|iris100:  chicken!|pg||
nt|han: instead of 2@d|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|sybarra: n/s are young but have played internationlly for some time |pg||
nt|sybarra: S on the NL ladies team |pg||
nt|han: I have a partner who would certainly bid 2@h with the south hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: slam here is to much|pg||
nt|haans: trust no spade lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Thank you everybody - enjoy the rest of this event|pg||
nt|jaapfr: all kibs rite about x @H lead making 3nt by N and the potential blocking|pg||
nt|onebid: Indeed, and good group here. Thanks|pg||
nt|sharynr: mine too Jordan|pg||
nt|sharynr: but what can you do|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, as we approach the end of this match, a big thank you to Roland Wald, to our excellent vugraph operator, and to Sharyn, Cindy, Iris, and Marshall and to all specs.|pg||
nt|han: I must say I agree with him on this hand|pg||
mb|4H|nt|cherdano:  now this time East is taking the aggressive route!|pg||
nt|lml: it is allowed in unlimited events at major tournaments if there are at least 6 boards per round|pg||
nt|cherdano:  and to you, Jordan|pg||
nt|shevek: looks like 5 imps to Greecoura to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: even then but no @C finesse|pg||
nt|haans: easy make if you see all cards|pg||
nt|rnmalik: again:)|pg||
nt|haans: smirny say 'its cold sp on D' na dright that is|pg||
nt|cherdano:  3@D shows spades, probably with a maximum|pg||
nt|lml: I was told I played it to confuse the opponents who would find it sooo hard to play against|pg||
nt|onebid: no longer matters:(|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The heart suit could easily be blocked against 3NT, but what does it matter when West has a trick in spades|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and what would we do with E in other room when he would lead @HAK2:)?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I agree that North should bid 1NT (or possibly 1@S if they are reversing things)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Excellent case for 3rd leads|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @H6 lead would unblock the suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Someone has asked me to explain the bidding. Would that I could|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It's a strong club, positive response, then it loses me a little|pg||
nt|onebid: seems that N thought 3@D was natural and South is cue bidding|pg||
nt|jaapfr: most of the 10 boards the Scotch were ""Ã¼nhappy"" imo|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So popular opinion has it that 3@C is a trump ask, 3@D denies a top honour|pg||
nt|paulg: 3@c is trump asking, 3@d says I have rubbish trumps, 4@d is cue|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In theory, the Scots are doing the right thing here, avoiding 3NT. The trouble is that no other game makes either|pg||
nt|onebid: Ah - Thx Paul|pg||
nt|paulg: as North is unlimited at this point|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not wishing to cause trouble, but we are Scots (Scotch is whisky)|pg||
nt|paulg: North will be looking for a forcing 3@c bid in the box now|pg||
nt|onebid: and very good whiskey:)|pg||
nt|onebid: But Paul, why would S need to ask about club quality?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a kib does not forgive W in other room for not bidding 3@H:)|pg||
nt|paulg: because they play a very simple system and it is how they show support|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the solution, jordan, is to make all diamond bids artificial :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: and right that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: director warned the players last 2 min|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep double swing here|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, Marion is an experienced player|pg||
nt|ritong: was a weird decision, admittedly|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6 more to Austria on 19 -- they set 2@S three tricks after 2@S by S, swish.  Late charge to keep the score respectable.|pg||
nt|milton_se: he's not alone|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cherdano:  evil Linda, evil!|pg||
nt|cindy:  thx all :)|pg||
nt|iris100:  that was really needed after that start!|pg||
pc|h8|nt|cherdano:  :)|pg||
nt|shevek: but maybe you should change your tactics when you play in a youth field?|pg||
nt|han: the bidding by south here is similar to that on board 26|pg||
nt|han: there south first underbid|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcwla: Well, as we approach the end of this match, a big thank you to Roland Wald, to our excellent vugraph operator, to Raija Davis and to all specs.  Coverage continues throughout the ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: day here on BBO.|pg||
nt|sybarra: one of the young pair on the dutch ladies team |pg||
nt|ritong: told you, they stood backline all set long|pg||
nt|onebid: I apologize for mis-spelling whisky:(|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|paulg: i guess 4@d may be keycard, looking at the 4@s bid|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lml: even though I provided a choice of two written defenses they could read at the table|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Could be Kickback. North has o keycards - took him a while to count them|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now lead @SA and continue @S pls lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they would be doing better if there were a hand that required a Vienna coup|pg||
nt|sharynr: bye for today|pg||
nt|iris100:  no Vienna coups today|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks again to all and for now, from Los Angeles, so long.|pg||
nt|iris100:  thanks and bye all!|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rnmalik: asking for the @CQ|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lml: during the auction|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|rnmalik: top 2 honours.|pg||
nt|shevek: we've seen, they like to bid a lot|pg||
pc|h9|nt|han: and when his partner signed off, he went on and got to an uncomfortably high contract|pg||
pc|h2|nt|milton_se: now making if AD|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|harmon: they couldnt read your writing|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|onebid: suit pref|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Nice jack, just in case|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I donÂ´t like 3@c and thatÂ´s why he has to play 4@h. 2nt is better in my opinion|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cherdano:  south of course has to ruff in low|pg||
nt|lestergold: but she needs to reconsider position before opening prempts in second piosition the odds increase hat your partne rhas a good hand nad that it may be ur hand so there is more to ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: lose by making an unsound bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting thought Nicoletta |pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|cherdano:  HedyG tells me usually in france, 3@D shows a minimum with spades|pg||
nt|cherdano:  if so, East would have been extremely aggressive|pg||
nt|lml: I play the same way|pg||
nt|lml: 3!M shows a good hand with that M|pg||
nt|cherdano:  note the @HT here, in case declarer has @HA9x|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|cherdano:  defense needs to force declarer|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: hi shirley where did u appear from?!?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|s6|pg||
nt|milton_se: I'd prefer 3D -- but would already be in 2H :)|pg||
nt|han: the good news is that 4H will make|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: the next round will start in 30 mins|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: see you 30 mins later|pg||
nt|haans: and bye for now specs have don every well :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: thanks bye for now|pg||
nt|cherdano:  South should get extra style points for that :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|buffytvs: thx all -- next set is in 1 hour|pg||
nt|cherdano:  so we might end with two more swings to USA blue|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: todays last qualification round will start in 45 mins|pg||
nt|lml: thank you and thanks for your comments about multi.  Please send them to the ACBL!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 53-6|pg||
