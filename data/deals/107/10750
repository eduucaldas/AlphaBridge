mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|dslee: For all the viewers, Keyzad and Swarnendu are two new additions to the Sree Cements team, Rana Roy had dropped out this time for medical reasons|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcwla: We'll start with Board 1 and continue through 16.  The OR will start with 14 and then circle back to 1, so we'll be providing them with the comparisons.|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzau: Welcome Sunit|pg||

mb|3N|nt|guthi: A straight forward auction here. |pg||
mb|p|nt|sunit: bidding looks funny, how come jeroo mango invited her partner???|pg||
nt|sunit: she has a clear cut 4h bid after partner has opened 2cl precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|guthi: Hi all. |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 2@H so much more commital than double.|pg||

nt|dslee: IDeal is a @H lead from Sridhar |pg||

nt|vugraphzau: Welcome back Guthi|pg||
nt|rvg: Looks ike GV has shown an 18-19 HCP hand - an upgrade|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jcwla: Just really don't like this 2@H -- the @H's are moth-eaten, it's too commital, the whole hand is a leaky dike.  North to blame for any bad here.|pg||

nt|rvg: This is an example of why switching to H7 from 987 (current expert practice) can be wrong at times|pg||
nt|rvg: Had Archie played a Club from dummy GV would have had a guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: with @c Q in east hand he would have finnesed|pg||

nt|jcwla: Not one peep from West, wow.|pg||
nt|dslee: Great, pass on the message to Key that in most of the deals, Swarnendu shd be the dummy|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the curse of Precision are the 1444's 6@C has a good play|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: but the double with no high major suit cards, a sub-minmum and misfit argue against action|pg||

nt|othered1: Matter of style or philosophy|pg||

nt|rvg: NS in a bad contract - A 2C bid would have worked better|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|othered1: On th is hand, but many play that bidding M - m - and later M shows a better hand than M - M - m.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dslee: this was a friendly lead for Key|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|rvg: Yes - so witth this hand you just pass partner's probably 2H preference|pg||
pc|d2|nt|don paulus: see :)|pg||
nt|guthi: nice catch :) |pg||
pc|dK|nt|sartaj1: West knows that East has only 3-4 points; so a heart switch (even if east has the H!K) is pointless|pg||
nt|sartaj1: He must be trying to construct the one layout where 3NT can be defeated; will give up very soon i reckon !|pg||
nt|dslee: yes, prospect of a @H move now and benefits if any|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s8|pg||
nt|guthi: I think the % play in the suit is to finesse again, but in the light of the bidding and entry issues ... |pg||
nt|othered1: And the @H suit feels to good to treat as only a 5-card suit.  Maybe a very sound weak 2 would describe the hand better, but it wouldn't get to @C either.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kiwibridge: we'll never know why some drag it out|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|guthi: good duck. |pg||
pc|h4|nt|dslee: claim time|pg||
nt|rvg: I would not open this hand 2H - this is too good a hand - a sound 1H opening|pg||
nt|othered1: passing the preference would be easy, but what if partner bids 2N or 2@D?  Again, matters of style.|pg||

nt|jcwla: On Board 1 in the OR, Venktesh made the much more flexible choice of doubling 2@C rather than bidding 2@H.  The defense has been excellent and will be rewarded with what looks like ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: 500.|pg||
nt|guthi: no danger of playing clubs here before drawing trumps. but.|pg||
nt|guthi: we'll never know!|pg||
nt|guthi: A routine 3NT for NS here.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all finesses working :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzau: west claimed in last 4 card position..hoping decl was out of trumps..director called|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: now back...director ruled 1 down|pg||
nt|guthi: seems they are all edgy, playing such a close match. |pg||
nt|othered1: wonder if north will weak 2?|pg||
nt|rvg: In their style they do open light in 1st position|pg||
nt|rvg: JM is a big advocate of that|pg||
nt|othered1: In favor of it, preemption.  Against, bad suit, bad vul., and too good for play in @H|pg||

mb|4H|an|!s|nt|rvg: I wouldn't advocate that opening but just sharing my knowledge of their style - light first & 3rd position|pg||

mb|p|nt|mandala r: he has 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: 4 @h 3 @s rest must come from @c and/or @d|pg||
nt|don paulus: depends on lead|pg||
nt|othered1: Play is more than good enough for vul 4@S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|guthi: I guess 15-16, its popular in India to play this range.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx operator|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: rather limited I would suggest 15-18 far superior as is 12-15|pg||
nt|guthi: Team Mango is from the west of India (Mumbai/Bombay) where precision systems are 'standard' :) |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: CCWei would be turning|pg||
nt|rvg: Now a Heart lead will sell the contract!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dslee: I am sure Key choosen to lead a @H over a @D because of the NT bid from Tiwari mostly denying major, but @D lead would had restricted in this deal|pg||
nt|sartaj1: 2NT was probably invitational; Tewary's hand with its nice club suit texture and length warrants a gameforce in my opinion|pg||
nt|guthi: you bet!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the trouble is there is no standard :)|pg||
nt|guthi: I play 14-16 when playing precision with my partner. it raises eyebrows everywhere here|pg||
nt|rvg: Uh oh!|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|mandala r: yes|pg||

nt|rvg: EW can make 5D/S but not sure if they will get there after a5C save|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder why west chose to double rather than start getting  his long suits into the auction directly|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: ian thinking|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|rvg: Important to get Spades into the auction hence the initial double - now they should be able to get to 5D but what if NS bid 5H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: lots of explantion going on|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mandala r: asking for 3-card h support?|pg||

nt|vugraphzau: sorry..by mistake i gave board 7 to the players|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bobholl: this probably is weak with high colours|pg||
nt|sartaj1: There are some who still play 2@D as showing 10-11 with a diamond fit. Their idea is to ensure getting to the marginal game when partner has a balanced 14 count|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|sartaj1: Perhaps this more on the "Swarnendu = dummy = good " principle :)|pg||

nt|sartaj1: What do you guys think of East's action over a 1@S opening ?|pg||
nt|guthi: another 1@C prec opener.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: again pard is bereft|pg||
nt|guthi: lets see if NS here can keep off the this slam|pg||
nt|rvg: that was a neat play by Archie|pg||
nt|rvg: I thought|pg||
mb|p|nt|guthi: this irresistible slam.|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, I wouldn't like +90 at all at matchpoints, but here it's OK|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|sartaj1: Pass, Double or 2@C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: how much better to open a 15-18 NT and have pard transfer to @D|pg||
nt|othered1: sometimes 1@S in 3rd seat is more preemptive than 2.  And it's close here.|pg||
mb|d|an|take out|nt|don paulus: 2 ih NS|pg||
nt|don paulus: @h|pg||
nt|rvg: On this hand 2S works out better|pg||
nt|rvg: Wonder what Ian will do over 3C now|pg||
nt|othered1: wonderif west was considering leaping Michaels (4@D to show red 2-suiter, usually stronger)|pg||
mb|3D|an|alerted|nt|dslee: 2@C|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcwla: Double I don't like.  It's pass or 2@C.|pg||
nt|dslee: I am afraid, NS might go overboard in this now|pg||
nt|guthi: They should be parking in 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: unless they play equal level conversions onthis auction (simple 3@D rebid over 3@C), west wouldn't have had a decent bid over 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: wrongsided|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and 2@D should be a transfer|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: not alerted 2@d|pg||
nt|guthi: yeah, it is wrongsided this time.|pg||
nt|rvg: One good convention is to play Leaping Michaels as a light takeout and direct cue as game in hand with minors or a much stronger Leaping Michaels|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: bang, thats it|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: north saying natural|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dslee: what is the lead @H :)? or @C:)?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: excellent, so another "variation" from standard :)|pg||
nt|guthi: hard to find people not playing transfers thesedays :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|don paulus: probably +1|pg||
nt|jcwla: So it's 6 to Sree Cement for bidding and making the NT game on 5 - with an overtrick no less.|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: director call by ian|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all sits well makeing 3, not many swing boards this set...apart from an amusing board 30 coming up soon|pg||
nt|othered1: That's one alternative.  But at these colors, they can't be too light, even with north's being a passed hand.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kiwibridge: feels the "natural 2@D should be alerted as NOT a trandfer!"|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sK|nt|guthi: Another forcing/non forcing 2H. |pg||
nt|rvg: Yes, preempts are always a problem :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Otherwise, I agree with you, if you don't want the direct cue bid to ask for a stopper in their suit.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzau: n/s playing precision|pg||
nt|guthi: that explains the auction. |pg||
nt|guthi: even playing std, the opening would be 1@D. So it was evident.|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: south thinking|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||
nt|othered1: Fact is, preempts work and do eat up valuable space.|pg||
nt|rvg: On this hand 5C would probably make on a Spade lead|pg||
pc|c3|nt|guthi: lack of complicated slam bidding gadgets make it difficult to bid this.|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: north denied @s cue|pg||
nt|guthi: but precision of CCWei offers good many gadets to check for controls., that would mean South should check controls in all the three suits. |pg||
pc|cA|nt|sartaj1: It was crucial to switch to hearts in time, else the diamonds provide enough discards; well done|pg||

mc|5|nt|vugraphzau: brb ..5 mins break|pg||
nt|rvg: Wonder what the other room will do - will Ian overcall 3H? unlikely that that hand would pass over 2S I think|pg||
nt|othered1: It's tough.  I'd bit the bullet and try 3@h, especially with north as passed hand.|pg||
nt|rvg: If he ovecalls 3H the bidding will probably go 3S by North, a responsive double by East (?) and they will probably|pg||
nt|rvg: land in 4H which North should double|pg||
nt|othered1: If west overcalls 3@H, east's next action isn't trivial, either.|pg||
nt|rvg: He has a reasonable expectation of beating 5D I think :)|pg||
nt|rvg: there are no comments from the kibitzers - a surprisingly silent community|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe, playing Precision, where partner can open even at these colors on light hands, west should rethink taking any aggresive action, but that can go double figures of imps wrong.|pg||
nt|rvg: Yes - these days nobody likes to miss games that have a 10% chance of success :)|pg||
nt|othered1: But there are lots of hands where east would sell to 2@S on which you make 4@H, a huge swing even if you beat 2@S.|pg||
nt|rvg: On board 7 Shridhar passed partner's 2S overcall and that turned out to be  a great winning decision|pg||
nt|rvg: you will recall that EW bid 3N going down here - at a certain point of time declarer could have made it after a defensive slip|pg||
nt|othered1: Not sure I'd find that.  Knowing partner's style in a tight partnership influences decisions.|pg||
nt|rvg: well Shridhar and Tewari are not a regular partnership - but I agree - passing is not the easiest of bids to make in that situation - partner makes a vulnerable 2S overcall and you ...|pg||
