nt|roswolf: n/s will have to avoid going on tilt|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They had one fine set, that's all|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|bjacobs: On this hand, it pays to put @SK on lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3nt was imo badly let through in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3 top losers|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But how weird ... why didn't West admit to his spade stopper?|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: He must have thought partner had a small singleton or doubleton club, or something.  2@H was a strange rebid|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might well go 2 off|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I much prefer the CR auction ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Barel had several chances to lead a spade against 3NT in the other room, but he never did|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He cashed two top diamonds and switched to a low heart|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Birman has yet another difficult decision (on lead).  This one has a happy ending|pg||
nt|Walddk2: After the second diamond it was too late of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: cashing aces is recommended|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North on lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok either red suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But E-W sounded as if they have nothing in spades, did they not?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, a spade would be automatic without the double.  The double is giving him 2nd, 3rd, 4th ... 100th thoughts|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but passive leads tend to break thes contracts|pg||
nt|roswolf: really only 1 imp lost if he leads a spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mind you, even on a spade lead this won't make, so not much harm done if Alon leads one|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Only a green suit lead lets this make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A question of 11 or 12 IMPs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I suppose it's flat if he takes another 2 hours, and the board is cancelled?|pg||
nt|roswolf: is it the righrt day for hippergriffs?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: generally only when on lead to 7NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: this thinking time is imo a waste in the context of a long match|pg||
nt|roswolf: pard has said it is going off then lead a card ANYcard|pg||
nt|bjacobs: PLEASE ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Geoffrey has promised to sing a lullaby while we're waiting|pg||
nt|vugraphzux: Last 2 segments' commentators asked me if we use timers (as used in the Championships). We don't. that's why he's thinking alot...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He has had 3 massive thinks in 3 boards.  But this one is a doozy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They should have monitored from the start. One segment yesterday took more than 3 hours!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *been monitored|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Excellent.  Overtime payments for me!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With folks like Alon, Barel, Zack and Ophir Herbst playing it is no surprise that this becomes excruciatingly slow|pg||
nt|roswolf: but what is he thinking about?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is fairly poor.  Acceptable for a difficult play or defence problem, but not an opening lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzux: I was informed that when Knockout system is applied, if no one in the table is complaining about the thinking time, both teams get a few IMPs off. that doesnt help..|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can't understand why they don't follow international procedure and have a time limit per 16 boards. Usually 2 hours and 20 minutes playing with screens|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer can just concede -2 now|pg||
nt|vugraphzux: I don't know why, althought this was asked yesterday and the day before that.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: The Biman team had four very costly boards in the first set|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Boker Tov, hello everyone and welcome back to Ra'anana for the Israel Team Trials. 8 segments of 16 boards; this is the sixth|pg||
nt|cicus: hi everyone|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: let us hope that this set is a bit quicker than the last. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Itamar Ginossar|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Gábor Szöts and Martin Carroll|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kiwibridge: welcome back Mike, hi Shirley we do hope so|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm all  from Wash. DC |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Same pairings in this room as Set 1.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good Morning all|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|cicus: this is going to be played at 3NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Gabor|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: East's values are surely too soft to raise|pg||
nt|haans: yes if NS bid they have close to 50% so no game|pg||
nt|haans: but E may have singel @D|pg||
nt|haans: may have ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: to set it, S will have to lead or switch to a spade |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this looks like -1 |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but 4@S looks gin|pg||
nt|cicus: hi Martin, Roland and all specs|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: 3@S ok, so no great shakes here|pg||
nt|cicus: this may be too tough|pg||
nt|mcarroll: @S switch may be found when pd signals in @D|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like -1|pg||
nt|sybarra: true losing 2 @C and a @D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and a late heart, I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possible squeeze on East|pg||
nt|sybarra: might |pg||
nt|sybarra: looking at that also |pg||
nt|cicus: @DJ may be overdoing it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Falsecard of @DJ should not fool S|pg||
nt|cicus: N will surely encourage holding 5 small|pg||
nt|mcarroll: On the other hand I hate leading from 4 to the J, it almost invariably helps declarer|pg||
nt|cicus: well S has to decide whether to play E for @DQJ doubleton or @SQx doubleton|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This is quite a tank?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS will grab three minor tricks and accept +50 |pg||
nt|haans: par contract|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that could have conceded the contract if West had had singleton @HK |pg||
nt|cicus: good start for the trailing team and it's certainly good for us spectators as the gap is going to be closer|pg||
mc|10|nt|mcarroll: True|pg||

nt|roswolf: fightback|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but don't forget 31 and 32. They are very bad for Birman|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: Could be 20+ IMPs away|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|roswolf: in the other room it looks like east had a gadget to show his 2 suiter and enraged his opps to overbid|pg||
nt|roswolf: good time for another red card|pg||
nt|vugraphzux: About that international procedures, the TD was joking with me saying "both teams got the same fine for thinking too much"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: That is not a valid point, joke or not|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bjacobs: In a way it's harmless (except for the poor specs), but come the real event, they won't be able to play like this|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup bill|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you have a monitor, it always transpires that one side has taken more time than the other side|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And that is the only way to make them play faster|pg||
nt|vugraphzux: ture, altough I dont see it helping too much with this players|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The fact that they are being monitored always makes them speed up, trust me|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If they are monitored, uneven fines can be applied ... which should only happen for ridiculously slow play, like we are seeing here|pg||
nt|vugraphzux: as we see it, there is one "ridiculously slow" player in each team. Alon (Birman's team) and Ophir Herbst (Herbst's team)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And Barel is fast do you think?|pg||
nt|vugraphzux: faster..|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "Not as slow" might be more accurate?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmm perceptions......:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzux: :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'll admit North has a tricky decision here ... don't know about you, but I've long ceased to care :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyway, no chance of beating this legitimately|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They had a chance on the double dummy low spade lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: @Sk was a signal for something + has made north go into the tank for a few more.... hours|pg||

nt|cicus: I'd bid 4 I'm sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: good contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 3nt looks rather good, in any case better than 3@c|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|ralfwil: With a @s ruff E can take 10 tricks with that favourable @s split|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|3S|mb|d|nt|roswolf: north into the valley of death|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@S is a good bid - particularly in catch up mode|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what is double in your methods, guys, take-out or panalties?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: penalties  even|pg||
nt|bjacobs: doesn't come up very often, so I would go with my principles: takeout|pg||
nt|vugraphzux: I must say that Birman's team is catching up on the IMPs very well after they had a 120 IMP diffrence yesterday in the 4th segment|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Indeed, but my estimate is that they are still 80 down when you take 31 and 32 into consideration|pg||
nt|roswolf: west settled for safety as he should at the match score|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I like 3NT - he can obviously hold up the spades, and reckons North does have a fast entry :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: does not ...|pg||

nt|roswolf: i didnt in a match a couple of days ago|pg||
nt|roswolf: aggregate scoring with honours counting!|pg||
nt|vugraphzux: Pachtman asked me to write: "W should have left the DBL active, so N won't have to think about leading again"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What would that help?|pg||
nt|roswolf: ouch!|pg||

nt|cicus: probably on the theory that you have only 1 suit to play on, not 2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c2|nt|cicus: also, in a suit contract, there is no ruffing value|pg||

nt|cicus: in fact it is only 1 down|pg||

nt|mcarroll: But will W pass?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ralfwil: hi Ed|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|othered1: pass by south was forcing, I'd think|pg||
pc|c4|nt|haans: good stop |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|haans: in my book its forcing to at least a raise|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can make arguments for and against pass by South being forcing here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: having redoubled 1@H, and doubled 1@s for (presumably) penalties, you would certainly put money on pass being forcing|pg||
nt|othered1: You redouble, then make a penalty double, then want to let them play at the2-level undoubled?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me only one round forcing|pg||
nt|haans: many have no agreement at all|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|kiwibridge: 17 indeed mysterious Mike|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree on pass of 2@D forcing only this round.|pg||
nt|cicus: there is nothin gmuch N can do here|pg||
nt|cicus: @SA small spade is most promising I think|pg||
nt|mcarroll: every lead helps declarer|pg||
nt|cicus: now that clubs have been blocked|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: but if South is merely saying "I have 10-11 hcp with good spades", then NS might have no fit and be prepared to defend undoubled  |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|othered1: may have to do with your standards for an opening 1-bid.|pg||
nt|haans: then he cannt pass with 12-13 hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one of those things where partnership discussion and agreement is needed  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: When N only can bid 2@h it´s easy for S to pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in my major partnerships, pass of 2@D would be forcing, and deny a penalty double of 2@D  |pg||
nt|othered1: sounds about right|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|cicus: even then, NS can't take more than 2@S+2@D+1@H|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: yes - after trick 3, the squeeze against East was on|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: what squeeze|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North can throw one losing diamond on the @HA, but what can he do with the other one? |pg||
nt|mdgraham: heart-club|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @HQ/K/A and run trumps - that does it I think|pg||
pc|d9|pg||

mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Tempting for EW to get too high here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: in a way W has a somewhat promising hand, but the heart holding is very bad on the auction, once N has not raised hearts despite being marked with some values|pg||

nt|cindy:  lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E had a hard hand to evaluate, but if W can invite when E holds those trumps it is understandable that E would not want to bid 3S, esp. since his 2S could probably have been on 3 ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: cards. still, 4C seems like a lot to bid. a simple 4S would be a reasonable middle ground|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Another tempting hand for EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|haans: 6@D???|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has better than minimum Losing Trick Count for an opener, playability in 3 suits including both majors, and adequate defense. that adds up to an opener by my lights. also it is ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not a hand on which it rates to be easy to enter later. unless it goes 1C-2C (or PPP1C), you will likely be frozen out|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mdgraham: that is the way with bididng systems. If they work, people will play them. If they don't they die out |pg||
nt|cindy:  they will never find their @d fit|pg||
nt|cindy:  once E raises @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: many systems are to hard to learn they die as you change partner|pg||

nt|mdgraham: no indeed. After 1@H/@S-pass-pass, 1NT=15-17 is quite playable|pg||
nt|cicus: so I think it can't be made|pg||
nt|cicus: probably takes a @D lead to set it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True - both @C and @D attempts to get back to hand will resuly in overuff or trump promotion|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: yikes! |pg||
nt|mdgraham: East trying to smoke them into 4@S?|pg||
nt|cindy:  E had too much coffee|pg||

pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: lots play protective 1NT as 12-14|pg||
nt|haans: he has spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but NS are an experienced pair - once they double for penalty, they don't run just because there is a redouble |pg||
nt|marlowepi: in that sense conventions differ radically from systems. terrible conventions--such as Gambling 3NT and Muiderberg--don't die out|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|c3|pg||
nt|haans: wider at 1M opening |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Not to worry I missed both at first|pg||

nt|cindy:  xruff looks good to me|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

nt|mcarroll: If the lead stays at this level, it will take a 5 imp per board gain to overturn|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that 1S overcall does not look like the action of an experienced pair, unless in the sense of Jimi Hendrix' "Are You Experienced?"|pg||

nt|cicus: yes, Birman has to stage a rally soon else we might see a concession of segment 8|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|cicus: instead of this @C continuation a @D was needed |pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: overcalling 1S on the N hand is astonishing. not just because of the short bad suit but because of the great defense to hearts. what is to stop pd from taking an advance phantom ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: save against a no-play 4H?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: he might have lef it even without the king|pg||
nt|marlowepi: holding 2 trump tricks and an ace|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with a partner who bid. less likely, but not impossible|pg||
nt|mdgraham: would North double on @SA and @HQJ10x? West might suspect hearts 5-0|pg||
nt|haans: i think he is thinking that :)|pg||
nt|haans: 5-0|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont accept that argument, because N couldnt expect to cash more than one spade anyway so spade king is not an extra asset for the double|pg||

pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: Perhaps 2@C was enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzux: We will take a 5 Minute break.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A bit of guessing on their methods, but after a standard 1@C-1@S, I think the correct rebid is 1NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So if West was allowed to bid 1NT over 1@C - 1@H (transfer) then  I think he should have|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can't, that would show a doubleton spade|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1 abstain transfer auctions have this weakness - on balanced hands below game it is difficult to find a sensible contract|pg||
