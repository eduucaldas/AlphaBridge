nt|rv: I believe Sundarram is just back from US and is suffering from jet lag, Prabhakar has not made the trip|pg||
nt|rv: that makes their performance all the more remarkable|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|2D|mb|2H|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|rv: topping the league with 2 of their top partnerships (Sridhar-Sundarram, Honey Prabhakar-Rajesh Tewari) not playing together is excellent|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|rv: and that way to bid it is my opinion for Aloke to bid 3@d|pg||
nt|panja: or, perhaps, 3@H first time, or something else than the present sequence..|pg||
