nt|andyv:  S with 2 tricks and Jx of @h, k@s behind the doubler, should know that 4@h is not going for a big number|pg||
nt|lml: if South had bid 4@H over the double I wonder what would have happened?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me itÂ´s better to lead @cJ from N, depending on the bidding|pg||
nt|andyv:  and he wants a @c lead on this auction|pg||
nt|lml: I like the idea of bidding 4@C over the double.  It makes a lot of sense|pg||
