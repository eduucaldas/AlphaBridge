pc|hA|nt|jcwla: Just really don't like this 2@H -- the @H's are moth-eaten, it's too commital, the whole hand is a leaky dike.  North to blame for any bad here.|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Yes 10 tricks available in NT, and 2 losers in the @C slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: Texan Aces topped the swiss league with 193imps...Mango was 2nd with 185 imps|pg||

nt|vugraphzau: sorry guys got to close this table as south not co-operating with me..see ya for second round|pg||

nt|jcwla: Hi.|pg||
nt|dslee: GA sartaj|pg||
nt|guthi: The comparisions should be arriving from now. Open room started with boards 46 onwards.|pg||
nt|rvg: but in my opinion that was warranted, especially playing Precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: brb...2 mins|pg||
nt|othered1: Matter of style or philosophy|pg||
nt|rvg: agreed|pg||
nt|othered1: mine, personally, tends towards sound initial actions.|pg||
nt|rvg: I notice nkudva is here - is that Mr. Kudva from Santacruz?  Glad to meet you again after 30 (?) years|pg||
nt|rvg: But of course I don't think Mr. Kudva can respond to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: back|pg||
nt|rvg: Cannot be a smoke break since none of these 4 smoke though at least two of them are ex-smokers|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: im a smoker..sorry|pg||
nt|guthi: How many @ds at this vul?|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H or @D partial guess @D|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Have they a weak 2@D available?|pg||
nt|bobholl: precision so guess not|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Of course Bob - Forgot they are playing Precision|pg||
mb|2D!|an|weak|nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Sartaj Hans|pg||
nt|rvg: OK :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|jcwla: Looks like 3NT here.  Meanwhile, the OR has now circled back to Board 1.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: should be a routine 4@s ew|pg||
mb|p|nt|mandala r: depends how he playe h|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: wont reach after 1nt opening|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mandala r: r they playing prec?|pg||
nt|bobholl: what did we say ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: 2@C -2@D-3NT|pg||
nt|guthi: 3@S is game forcing, its lot of bidding imo. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|guthi: Dbl is 5-7 I suppose. |pg||
nt|guthi: Interesting 2@D, can we have an explaination Mahesh?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: LOL|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mandala r: yhen why not 1-c?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|don paulus: whats the range for 1 nt ?|pg||

nt|guthi: We have our first IMP exchage of this segement, 3 to Team Mango, they were allowed to make 4@H on the first board.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|don paulus: declarer may expect K @h in S|pg||
nt|sartaj1: looks like 11 comfortable tricks after this start|pg||
nt|rvg: NS in a bad contract - A 2C bid would have worked better|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|othered1: On th is hand, but many play that bidding M - m - and later M shows a better hand than M - M - m.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|dslee: this was a friendly lead for Key|pg||
nt|bobholl: started with 2 rounds of @S so @C loser disappeared|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rvg: Yes - so witth this hand you just pass partner's probably 2H preference|pg||
pc|cK|nt|don paulus: see :)|pg||
nt|guthi: nice catch :) |pg||
pc|c3|nt|sartaj1: West knows that East has only 3-4 points; so a heart switch (even if east has the H!K) is pointless|pg||
nt|sartaj1: He must be trying to construct the one layout where 3NT can be defeated; will give up very soon i reckon !|pg||
nt|dslee: yes, prospect of a @H move now and benefits if any|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|s4|nt|guthi: I think the % play in the suit is to finesse again, but in the light of the bidding and entry issues ... |pg||
nt|othered1: And the @H suit feels to good to treat as only a 5-card suit.  Maybe a very sound weak 2 would describe the hand better, but it wouldn't get to @C either.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kiwibridge: we'll never know why some drag it out|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|guthi: good duck. |pg||
pc|dK|nt|dslee: claim time|pg||
nt|rvg: I would not open this hand 2H - this is too good a hand - a sound 1H opening|pg||
nt|othered1: passing the preference would be easy, but what if partner bids 2N or 2@D?  Again, matters of style.|pg||

nt|don paulus: or 2 ?|pg||
nt|jcwla: On Board 1 in the OR, Venktesh made the much more flexible choice of doubling 2@C rather than bidding 2@H.  The defense has been excellent and will be rewarded with what looks like ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: 500.|pg||
nt|guthi: no danger of playing clubs here before drawing trumps. but.|pg||
nt|guthi: we'll never know!|pg||
nt|guthi: A routine 3NT for NS here.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all finesses working :)|pg||
nt|guthi: ah, now we'll never know what happened :) Doesnt matter for the score, so, np.|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: west claimed in last 4 card position..hoping decl was out of trumps..director called|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: now back...director ruled 1 down|pg||
nt|guthi: seems they are all edgy, playing such a close match. |pg||
nt|othered1: wonder if north will weak 2?|pg||
nt|rvg: In their style they do open light in 1st position|pg||
nt|rvg: JM is a big advocate of that|pg||
nt|othered1: In favor of it, preemption.  Against, bad suit, bad vul., and too good for play in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: So 12 to Texan Aces.|pg||
nt|guthi: Thanks for the info Mahesh.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|dslee: I am sure South had a happy beginning in the open room :)|pg||
nt|guthi: They might reach 4@S here. |pg||
nt|bobholl: E 1@S will S bid 2nt ? or vulnarable too weak?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|dslee: Pass ?|pg||
nt|guthi: wonder what their 1NT opening range is, for NS. |pg||
nt|vugraphzau: 15-16|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 12/13 to 15 I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|rvg: I wouldn't advocate that opening but just sharing my knowledge of their style - light first & 3rd position|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|guthi: North choose to pass with the 12 count, interesting.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mandala r: he has 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: 4 @h 3 @s rest must come from @c and/or @d|pg||
nt|don paulus: depends on lead|pg||
nt|othered1: Play is more than good enough for vul 4@S.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|guthi: I guess 15-16, its popular in India to play this range.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx operator|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: rather limited I would suggest 15-18 far superior as is 12-15|pg||
nt|guthi: Team Mango is from the west of India (Mumbai/Bombay) where precision systems are 'standard' :) |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: CCWei would be turning|pg||
nt|rvg: Now a Heart lead will sell the contract!|pg||
nt|bobholl: oops now it migth(will) make|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dslee: I am sure Key choosen to lead a @H over a @D because of the NT bid from Tiwari mostly denying major, but @D lead would had restricted in this deal|pg||
nt|sartaj1: 2NT was probably invitational; Tewary's hand with its nice club suit texture and length warrants a gameforce in my opinion|pg||
nt|guthi: you bet!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the trouble is there is no standard :)|pg||
nt|guthi: I play 14-16 when playing precision with my partner. it raises eyebrows everywhere here|pg||
nt|rvg: Uh oh!|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|mandala r: yes|pg||
nt|guthi: 3@S should be help suit. better than directly bidding 4.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: nice, claimed|pg||
nt|guthi: I think the Mahesh cut it short! :) |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they are very slow in the open room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: "standard" prec 2@C opener|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with luck they won't find their @S fit :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: are they on a break?|pg||
nt|guthi: Yep, standard 2@C opener, but after a likely 2@D overcall|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: maybe even 3@D|pg||
nt|guthi: South would Dbl to show his majors. a tad weak on values maybe.|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: waiting for north to bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: brb|pg||
nt|guthi: Open room is atleast 3 boards ahead :)|pg||
nt|guthi: good bidding at the other table. Playing standard East did well to keep the auction alive. |pg||
nt|guthi: Precision will do well on this board. |pg||
nt|vugraphzau: waiting for players..|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: south/east are not there |pg||
nt|guthi: may be not, North will find his @D ruff.|pg||
nt|guthi: then @H should be played correctly, interesting board.|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: now all back|pg||
nt|guthi: The website for this event is http://www.hcl-bridge.com/index.jsp|pg||
nt|guthi: nice hand.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Another Precision 1@C opening|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess 4@h going down|pg||
nt|guthi: I see no way of making 4@H, unless the opponents help|pg||
nt|bobholl: except on a @C lead from N|pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: N unusual nt ?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|don paulus: after @h opening W|pg||
nt|don paulus: great @c fit !|pg||

mb|1S|nt|guthi: We have some IMPs for Team Promila here|pg||
mb|d|nt|mandala r: yes correct road|pg||
nt|bobholl: if he can invite with 55 :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1st this segment yey|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rvg: will probably end up in 3S which is not a great success|pg||
mb|d|nt|dslee: passed hand this is not inverted|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nS out of danger now :)|pg||
nt|guthi: North at the other table gifted a trick on the lead - on board 18. |pg||
nt|bobholl: 3NT makes (4@H 1 @S 4 in minors)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rvg: ok looks like they are bidding 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: sorry..by mistake i gave board 7 to the players|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bobholl: this probably is weak with high colours|pg||
nt|sartaj1: There are some who still play 2@D as showing 10-11 with a diamond fit. Their idea is to ensure getting to the marginal game when partner has a balanced 14 count|pg||
nt|jcwla: Double for cards.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and it cost 5... quite a lot really|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|bobholl: 3 @H now migth deliver game |pg||
mb|p|nt|guthi: I'd dbl as South. |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this can go a few down|pg||
nt|guthi: better choice of rebid.|pg||
nt|guthi: On this deal atleast.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzau: north thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|guthi: a gift on the lead. Makes things easier for the declarer.|pg||
nt|bobholl: but they will reach 4 @H now (their timing is bad)|pg||
nt|guthi: and North will lead a @S I guess|pg||
nt|bobholl: switching their choices on last 2 boards makes a lot of difference|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: south on lead|pg||
nt|guthi: :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|don paulus: lucky @d split|pg||
nt|bobholl: if he doesn't bid 4@H now when will he ?|pg||

nt|vugraphzau: :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bobholl: i did my max :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: :)|pg||
nt|sartaj1: 3 @D looks a very unilateral action to these eyes|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|guthi: Will she try to ruff a @D in hand? |pg||
nt|vugraphzau: he|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: she is west...east he|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sartaj1: Perhaps this more on the "Swarnendu = dummy = good " principle :)|pg||
nt|rvg: this will probably get beaten - defense should get 1 spade , 1H, 2D, 1C but some care may be needed|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|bobholl: we don't see them :)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hard to understand underlead of A@H|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcwla: Board 3 a push at +110 N/S in @D's.|pg||
nt|sartaj1: After the takeout double of 2@D , declarer is probably worried about a 4-1 split. I'm predicting a spade next|pg||
nt|rvg: After winning the CA GV will need to cash DA and exit Spades|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|guthi: Did North want to put the declarer to a guess?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: should get hus ruff anyways :)|pg||
nt|guthi: yes.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sartaj1: Risky line of play; If diamonds were 4-1, East could now return a trump and declarer is in control-trouble|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kiwibridge: and uppercut for pard|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|bobholl: strange best way seems to ruff in E a @D|pg||
nt|guthi: since the contract is always safe if club finesse works, its not hard to see?|pg||
nt|bobholl: but with 52 cards in sigth things are always easier:)|pg||
nt|guthi: ;)|pg||
nt|guthi: Team Mango gained 7 on board 21, where in the Open room EW stopped in just 2@S! |pg||
nt|bobholl: but texan aces will gsin on next 2 boards :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: gain|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: north thinking|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The only losing option here is to continue @Cs|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzau: .|pg||

pc|sT|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|guthi: Guess you are saving all the fireworks till the last few boards!|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: still 9 boards to go|pg||
nt|othered1: Precision west has an automatic opening|pg||
nt|mcarroll: @S game for NS?|pg||
nt|bobholl: on 22 Mango bid 4@S (phantom save)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rvg: No deal 1 the Mango defender tried an unusual lead of SA against 3N and that was not a success - he lost his only entry|pg||
nt|othered1: On this hand it would be nicer if 1@D were normal, not ambiguous. North's 1N is automatic, if within range|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: Not Mango It was Texan Aces|pg||
mb|3C|an|pre-empt|nt|guthi: This is the second of three 3x16 semifinal.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: is their 1N overcall also 15-16?|pg||
nt|bobholl: very good 4@S but biddable ??|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|dslee: @C partial for NS - 2 or 3|pg||
nt|guthi: I hope not.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: double on 3334 madness|pg||
nt|rvg: oh yes, of course thanks for correcting Mahesh|pg||
mb|4S|nt|othered1: east may well consider if west's primary suit is @C.  Here he found the good @H lead|pg||
nt|rvg: These low level contracts are fascinating to analyze |pg||
nt|rvg: here it looks like he can make 3N|pg||
nt|othered1: either minor lead would be quite costly for the defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzau: 3@s by south...missed the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: will post the result..sorry |pg||
nt|don paulus: E must have opened - nm|pg||
nt|don paulus: np|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: now it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: NT looks better.|pg||
nt|guthi: Yes, it rarely works. South missed the bus failing to overcall 1NT. |pg||
pc|c6|nt|sartaj1: The 1NT advance to a overcall is fairly wide ranging; South could have had upto 11 or so points, so I like North's push towards game|pg||
nt|guthi: East has 11 red cards :) |pg||
nt|rvg: say by conceding a Club|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|kiwibridge: NOW he does and should get a savage boot for his trouble|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: again pard is bereft|pg||
nt|guthi: lets see if NS here can keep off the this slam|pg||
nt|rvg: that was a neat play by Archie|pg||
nt|rvg: I thought|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 nt NS no problem|pg||
mb|1H|nt|guthi: this irresistible slam.|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, I wouldn't like +90 at all at matchpoints, but here it's OK|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|sartaj1: Pass, Double or 2@C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: how much better to open a 15-18 NT and have pard transfer to @D|pg||
nt|othered1: sometimes 1@S in 3rd seat is more preemptive than 2.  And it's close here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: 2 ih NS|pg||
nt|don paulus: @h|pg||
nt|rvg: On this hand 2S works out better|pg||
nt|rvg: Wonder what Ian will do over 3C now|pg||
nt|othered1: wonderif west was considering leaping Michaels (4@D to show red 2-suiter, usually stronger)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|dslee: 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Double I don't like.  It's pass or 2@C.|pg||
nt|dslee: I am afraid, NS might go overboard in this now|pg||
nt|guthi: They should be parking in 3@D|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 2@D 2@H 3nt|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|othered1: unless they play equal level conversions onthis auction (simple 3@D rebid over 3@C), west wouldn't have had a decent bid over 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: wrongsided|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and 2@D should be a transfer|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: not alerted 2@d|pg||
nt|guthi: yeah, it is wrongsided this time.|pg||
nt|rvg: One good convention is to play Leaping Michaels as a light takeout and direct cue as game in hand with minors or a much stronger Leaping Michaels|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sounds reasonable|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dslee: bang, thats it|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: north saying natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: what is the lead @H :)? or @C:)?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: excellent, so another "variation" from standard :)|pg||
nt|guthi: hard to find people not playing transfers thesedays :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|don paulus: probably +1|pg||
nt|jcwla: So it's 6 to Sree Cement for bidding and making the NT game on 5 - with an overtrick no less.|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: director call by ian|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all sits well makeing 3, not many swing boards this set...apart from an amusing board 30 coming up soon|pg||
nt|othered1: That's one alternative.  But at these colors, they can't be too light, even with north's being a passed hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: feels the "natural 2@D should be alerted as NOT a trandfer!"|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|guthi: Another forcing/non forcing 2H. |pg||
nt|rvg: Yes, preempts are always a problem :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Otherwise, I agree with you, if you don't want the direct cue bid to ask for a stopper in their suit.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: what would you lead as w @C K ?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yep|pg||
pc|d6|nt|guthi: after North bid 2@c? :) |pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzau: n/s playing precision|pg||
nt|guthi: that explains the auction. |pg||
nt|guthi: even playing std, the opening would be 1@D. So it was evident.|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: south thinking|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h6|nt|othered1: Fact is, preempts work and do eat up valuable space.|pg||
nt|rvg: On this hand 5C would probably make on a Spade lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|guthi: lack of complicated slam bidding gadgets make it difficult to bid this.|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: north denied @s cue|pg||
nt|guthi: but precision of CCWei offers good many gadets to check for controls., that would mean South should check controls in all the three suits. |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sartaj1: It was crucial to switch to hearts in time, else the diamonds provide enough discards; well done|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|vugraphzau: brb ..5 mins break|pg||
nt|rvg: Wonder what the other room will do - will Ian overcall 3H? unlikely that that hand would pass over 2S I think|pg||
nt|othered1: It's tough.  I'd bit the bullet and try 3@h, especially with north as passed hand.|pg||
nt|rvg: If he ovecalls 3H the bidding will probably go 3S by North, a responsive double by East (?) and they will probably|pg||
nt|rvg: land in 4H which North should double|pg||
nt|othered1: If west overcalls 3@H, east's next action isn't trivial, either.|pg||
nt|rvg: He has a reasonable expectation of beating 5D I think :)|pg||
nt|rvg: there are no comments from the kibitzers - a surprisingly silent community|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe, playing Precision, where partner can open even at these colors on light hands, west should rethink taking any aggresive action, but that can go double figures of imps wrong.|pg||
nt|rvg: Yes - these days nobody likes to miss games that have a 10% chance of success :)|pg||
nt|othered1: But there are lots of hands where east would sell to 2@S on which you make 4@H, a huge swing even if you beat 2@S.|pg||
nt|rvg: On board 7 Shridhar passed partner's 2S overcall and that turned out to be  a great winning decision|pg||
nt|rvg: you will recall that EW bid 3N going down here - at a certain point of time declarer could have made it after a defensive slip|pg||
nt|othered1: Not sure I'd find that.  Knowing partner's style in a tight partnership influences decisions.|pg||
nt|rvg: well Shridhar and Tewari are not a regular partnership - but I agree - passing is not the easiest of bids to make in that situation - partner makes a vulnerable 2S overcall and you ...|pg||
nt|rvg: have xx, AXX, QTxxxx, KJ|pg||
nt|rvg: A trivia question - what is Tewari's pet name?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: sorry all, must go now. Cricket beckons |pg||
nt|guthi: 5 more boards to score. |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so 9 more to Mango :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Enjoy the day.|pg||
nt|guthi: claim for 11 imps. |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: must leave you now for the youth, thanks all|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: 2 more boards |pg||
nt|guthi: Bye Mike.|pg||
nt|bobholl: NS should show some restriction on this hand 1@S 1NT all pass for example :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|guthi: a brave 2@D (tranfer to @H after a 1NT opening) in the other room, at this vul.|pg||
nt|rvg: SOmeone said that he misplayed 3N but I am not sure of that - he did not have two entries to dummy to take a Club double finesse AFAICR|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@C is good enough but not automatic to bid.|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|rvg: I was referring to board 10 in other room|pg||
nt|bobholl: ok 1@S 1nt 2@C 2@D 2@S|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|guthi: needs to guess the club position correctly to make.|pg||
mb|2D|an|alerted|nt|guthi: They will likely stop in 2@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|guthi: 2@H must be general good hand, yes, it is.|pg||
nt|othered1: That was short and ineffective.|pg||
nt|guthi: Are they playing Bart?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: looks so :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rvg: But as Ed pointed out, declarer on board 10 could have held up the SA at trick 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: they are not listening to me (the bastards)|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: they will be punished properly i guess :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|jcwla: On 10, where N/S here played 4@H after 3@C-4@C, the OR N began with a double and N/S ended in 3NT-1.  3 more to Texan Aces.|pg||
nt|bobholl: -3 looks a lot (bad guessing)|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: this sort of comments are abuse  on BBO|pg||

nt|mariner1: EW need to avoid a RED slam here.......... though it could make with no @S lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: this one should get high quickly|pg||
nt|rv: 2 of the BB QFs performances was by Formidables who rival Texans for the title of the best Indian team on current form|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|6C|mb|d|nt|mariner1: slam in one pass|pg||
nt|rv: Alok Sadhu is an inveterate bidder, he has max of only 1 pass card in his bidding box which he uses rarely as well|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|mariner1: never know where a hand like this will score|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rv: Sridhar wouldn't visualize all the cover cards in Tewari's hand and made a practical bid of 5@d|pg||

nt|guthi: not hard to find sitting here, after about 60 boards on one day ... :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzau: last board of this segment..tomorrow 9.00 am local time the finals|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In 25 minutes|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Texan Aces are beginning to pullaway|pg||
nt|rvg: did he make 3NT on that hand?  Seeme unbelievable|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: yes after misdefense  |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes it seems amazing - but he made it|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: a little hilp from defense is all jm is always looking for|pg||
nt|guthi: :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|guthi: oo la la, they missed 6@S in the other room. |pg||
nt|guthi: how many imps can this be? 13 will make it 1imp victory|pg||
nt|rvg: Yes, this was a tough slam to reach|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|Walddk4: Thanks Mahesh, Rajandra and Ed|pg||
nt|rvg: Then he seems to have come to the right table :-)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugraphzau: Thank you Roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: As we approach the end of this segment, a big thank you to Mahesh (who did an especially great job under the circumstances), as well as to Roland Wald, Sartaj, Debgiri and to all ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: specs.|pg||
nt|guthi: 4@H has a play, here.|pg||
nt|guthi: EW can make up to 5@H I think/|pg||
nt|rvg: let's see how he may have made it - after winning the DA he probably played low spade hoping for Spades 3-3 and finesse and East probably hopped up with King and played Diamond|pg||
nt|rvg: Now JM has 4 Spades, 4 Diamonds and a Heart |pg||
mb|5C|nt|panja: difficult to bid the slame..need @H KJ to 4..and also 4 Spades...it is a little less than 50% even with that..|pg||
mb|5H|mb|6C|nt|guthi: so 6@C is a good save. |pg||
nt|rvg: no he still has only 3 Spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jnp: Sudhakar is from Visakhapattanam, a consevative solid player|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Rajendra, sry|pg||
mb|d|nt|guthi: dear dear, this is too much bidding by East. Again.|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: Ian giving partner 7 carder @d|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks Mahesh and Rajendra! And Roland.  I'll be retiring (it's approaching 2 am here.)|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: by Ed|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: I'll be back with you in 19 hours 20 minutes for the OR of the first segment of the final.  For now, from Los Angeles, so long.|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: well done Mango Team...|pg||
nt|guthi: maybe. too bad they don't know the siuation. |pg||
nt|guthi: So we have a winner. |pg||
nt|guthi: West can push once more by bidding 4@d. |pg||
nt|vugraphzau: other semi finals ...Texan Aces won by 30 imps...so Mango vs Texan Aces...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rvg: thanks ed and mahesh|pg||
