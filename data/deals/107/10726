mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|brolucius: Did the Director have anything to say about the three hours spent on the previous set? If not, why not?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|vugraphzux: Nothing was said from the TD about the last segment.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|brolucius: 1@S shows three-card spade support. With four-card support, he would jump to 2@S even on a minimum hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The first segment today was excruciatingly slow, and it did not help that one pair arrived 15 minutes late|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mariner1: well the @H lead actually should help a little|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|brolucius: I will not complain about the people who were a bit late... I have every sympathy.|pg||
nt|vugraphzux: There's a problem with few players who thinks alot on 60% of their bidding/play.|pg||
nt|vugraphzux: That actually was the big delay|pg||
nt|mariner1: the issue here seems to be trick 7.....|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|jcwla: Over to page 67 of my notes for my thoughts on NT leads from Q-9-fourth (or K-T fourth).  They are quite short.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: close to slam but too many soft values|pg||
nt|ady: nice easy 3NT for n/s to start     can make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cards :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|marlowepi: that is, S has too much soft stuff after 2N|pg||
nt|ady: might get to 6NT  going down|pg||
nt|sybarra: how about 6 @C?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nobody would make 12|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4NT by S and pass by N?|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C  is the best spot    if clubs 3-2  just need simple diamond finesse|pg||
nt|panja: South does not really have a good hand for slam..|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this is not an easy hand in the bidding. if S bids 4N, N will like the chances of 6C|pg||
nt|sybarra: skip the 6 @C comment, you need eyes on the ceiling|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's what a take-out double should look like|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: perfect indeed and 3@H on EW|pg||
nt|haans: and bidding clubs to get opps to high|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: South can raise clubs, but does the 1@C opening show a real suit? |pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: our operator is Genossar Itamar , shalom lecha!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some sort of raise to 4N?|pg||
nt|vugraphzuw: =]|pg||
nt|sybarra: or minors |pg||
nt|panja: 24 HCP missing in AK's...if N has 21 of them..some chance..if N has a J or a Q...2 key cards will be missing and slam is no better than 50%|pg||
nt|lml: hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|sybarra: you just need a @S lead to the ace,  guess the stiff K of @D....and voila |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: as so oftenb happens, the 2N opening preempts the side who owns the hand, making delicate slam exploration extremely difficult|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: is this what Levin wanted with his pass?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is a very aggressive second double by East. Still, he is 65 imps down|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C a make|pg||
nt|haans: sort of ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West could easily have bid at his first opportunity - surely he cannot bid less than game now |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4@s like quantitative 4NT|pg||
nt|ady: if you gesss the stiff K@D   you only need one spade trick|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is true also |pg||
nt|marlowepi: why would anyone do that?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but how to do that?|pg||
nt|panja: y Marshall, absolutely..|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning from los angeles|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: there is a verb to describe that, and it is not "guess"|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Ra'anana for the Israel Team Trials. 8 segments of 16 boards; this is the fifth and last today|pg||
pc|d2|nt|panja: 2Nt is what I would like to designate as 'offside opening', too far too soon|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  may well be starting with a swing here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@c shows 4 cards in @c|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with decent support for all of pards suits I would have tried 3@H initially|pg||
nt|haans: Birman taking a chance|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this has good chances if declarer can pick the spades and clubs - and I think he will|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi andy, linda, roland, specs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Itamar Ginossar. Welcome to you|pg||
nt|lml: its early for you.  A little later in Toronto|pg||
nt|vugraphzuw: ty|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk4: and to our commentators, Linda, Marshall, Bob and Andy|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: shalom Mar Ginossar|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|ady: OR  in 4NT I am told   so n/s  will ;ose a little here being in clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Both East's doubles were for take-out. A take-out double does not later metamorphose into a penalty double |pg||
nt|haans: levin could not bid 3@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Levin has converted, but q102 of clubs not a great holding|pg||
nt|vugraphzuw: shalom shalom|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Linda, Itamar, Bob and Marshall|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|kiwibridge: why not Haans seemed obvious|pg||
nt|lml: the diamond lead seemed a good start for the defense|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: 8x 16 boards to play|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|haans: immediate yes but 3@H now?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: we start off with just the sort rip-roaring contract that a team trailing by 74 IMPs thirsts to see|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Personally, I would have bid as West. At 65 down, defending 3@Cx on the first board with only Q10x of trumps opposite known shortage fails to appeal |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|kiwibridge: yes pard has reopened in case it was a trap pass, so I guess he has made two mistakes :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  your type of swing hand, Marshall|pg||
nt|lml: still this isn't that easy a contract|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no a few IMPs could be at stake it is true|pg||
nt|lml: South returned a high diamond suggesting a spade|pg||
nt|andyv:  Birman made up a few imps last set... they were down by more than 90 at one poing|pg||
nt|lml: but North isnt so sure about spades|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kiwibridge: he got spades right|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|andyv:  point|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: overtrick now!|pg||
nt|haans: Birman need new discussion NOW|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The psychological effect of this result could be considerable|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: depressingly so|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: just staying out of slam will make each NS hope for a swing. the slam is odds against single-dummy, but playable|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: i like "poing", andy. in french it means fist|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|lml: I can see 6 tricks now for declarer but where is the seventh|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also reminds me of a cartoon from my early childhood "Gerald McBoingBoing"|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: for both pairs: imagine how you would feel at score-up; youa re 65 down - board 1, team-mates say "minus 470"|pg||
nt|lml: I remember Gerald|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s6|pc|h8|pc|c8|pg||
nt|lml: nice try by declarer but the defense stayed "en pointe"|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: Created by Dr.Seuss, Gerald was a baby/child who spoke only in sound effects|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|lml: I know its more interesting at matchpoints but this type of hand is a really battle|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 3NT is not much of a challenge|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|an|Hurts|nt|brolucius: 1@D shows hearts, remember.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|an|3 Hurts|nt|Walddk2: 1@H usually 3|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|brolucius: Now West must discover that his partner has a minimum opening, to avoid getting too high.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d8|nt|brolucius: That was well bid. West did not even have to bid 4NT on his hand.|pg||

mb|1C|nt|sybarra: may well hear 4 @S from S |pg||
nt|marlowepi: S hand on the strong side for 3S, but a bit thinfor 4S|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@S?|pg||
nt|panja: if S bids 4@S, I guess small @H lead needed to defeat...|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S   looks on fpr n/s     5@C   some sort of save |pg||
nt|marlowepi: S might compromise with D, but i predict 4S after the huddle|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4@s is NOT preempt here|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: max of 32 no fit ??|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: after the 1NT rebid, 3N automatic|pg||
nt|lml: they might have had a fit ... depends if East would bid a major|pg||
nt|lml: we don't|pg||
nt|lml: also East may not raise diamonds with a balanced hand|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: trump   trump best|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you play walsh you wouldn't but i play montreal so obliged to bid high color|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E is in a position to even think about raising diamonds, he has shape|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kiwibridge: this could go down too|pg||
nt|haans: to go down here is standard|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kiwibridge: passive lead|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s6|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: S afraid it might be a cashout situation in the minors, hesitant to lead club in case N stuff is in diamonds and declarer could otherwise run trumps & hearts.  that Kx of hearts is ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a scary holding|pg||
nt|ady: should be down 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: official website : http://www.israbridge.com/home/results/2009/trl-final.pdf|pg||
nt|panja: when a small @D is now played to @DQ....South will have to win allowing E the @DK entry to the fourth Diamond, and a useful @S discard late in the day|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC : http://tinyurl.com/np5cm3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S would go down on heart lead. presumably the ace. heart ruff and club shift takes out dummy's entry prematurely and declarer has to lose 2 diamonds|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you could change the ten of D into the king, giving E a supermax, and it still would be a poor slam|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: Yes East won't raise diamonds with say 4-4-3-2 with the minors and slam could be there if East has a better hand|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s3|pc|hT|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Levin so completely flat why did he pull it|pg||
nt|lml: East had a complete minimum some might say not an opening|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|ady: I think there should be a heart ruff first  and then draw trump   and then quuen diamonds|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless 1D is semi-artificial, I don;t see why E would not raise diamonds with that shape. it is not MPs. you shouldn;t respond in a suit you don;t want to hear raised|pg||
nt|lml: it is a style thing I suppose|pg||
nt|lml: I like to distinguish between balanced hands and those with shape|pg||
nt|andyv:  E/W must bid up the line for W not to have trotted out one of his majors.|pg||
nt|lml: in my partnerships we bid 1NT unless unbalanced and have ways to check back|pg||
nt|lml: I do bid up the line too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too. but i like to raise pd also. i want my suits raised when he has support, so i expect he will too|pg||
pc|sT|nt|panja: @HA lead would not work..against 4@S..|pg||

mb|d|an| |nt|Walddk2: Not sure it's a good gadget when the singleton is a king|pg||
nt|brolucius: A good response if competing in a Bridge World bidding challenge. Otherwise 3NT is a lively possibility.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: S has a bit of a dilemna from his perspective|pg||
nt|nicksan: Well, I don't think North is going to bid 3 NT now...|pg||
nt|mariner1: so he passes the problem to N|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has not bid a minor, so he is suggesting 3NT to North.|pg||
mb|r|nt|brolucius: If North bids 4@C nevertheless, South will think he has some great cards and will need some persuading that 6@C should not be bid.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: I'm not impresed by the auction. What if 4@C had been a 4-3 fit? |pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|mariner1: kibbers think S should have REDBL here,,,,,,, and in some methods I agree|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I suspect that redouble asked South to bid his longer minor. Not sure what Alon would have done over 4@D which could have been 3. It was plenty difficult after 4@C|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: Redouble by North must have offered South 3NT as an option too.|pg||
nt|nicksan: For me, RD would say "i want to play 3 @S RD" !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Too simple, Nick|pg||
nt|brolucius: Otherwise North would simply bid 4@C to show which way round his 5-4 was.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 3S by N now?|pg||
nt|andyv:  my objection is more along the lines that S has too many aces with the 5 card major|pg||
nt|andyv:  aces belong in suit contracts|pg||
nt|lml: it does look suit oriented|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't like that with a K in @H|pg||

nt|hedyg: 2@HX was -1 with @d lead and repeated play|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: depends what a bid shows and what a passs shows|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think 2@s should show a clear preference|pg||

pc|dK|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hedyg: there is a good chance that N has 4@hs so i really dont like the X by S|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: naybe N thinks he has a clear preference with spades lobger than Ds. also, you are less likely to be doubled if you bid it a sif you liked it|pg||
nt|haans: they cannot walk out now anyway|pg||
nt|andyv:  some like the security of knowing about the 4th trump|pg||

nt|marlowepi: the Bergenoid mixed-raise argument makes tolerable sense when your major is hearts. but not in spades IMHBAICO|pg||
nt|lml: this hand is not that far from a limit raise and if you bid 2@S on too many hands it is hard for partner to judge|pg||

nt|mariner1: there is a better minor preference for sure|pg||
nt|nicksan: System may require them to open 1 @D if they have 4 of them...|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the UK all bridge teachers over 75 years old recommend 1@D.|pg||
nt|vugraphzux: CORRECTION: Board 4 score is -140 and not -170.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: np Yarden|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It has been corrected|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do not try to rescue partner. He has also seen the vulenatbility when he overcalled 1@S|pg||
nt|nicksan: N/S will not be able to get away undoubled after this start...|pg||
nt|brolucius: "I can't remember why, young David, but that is what I was always taught!"|pg||
nt|mariner1: bid what you have, not what you think you have :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Nor what you think partner has.|pg||
nt|nicksan: Yes, partner has seen the vulnerability, but he didn't know when he bid that partner would be short and there would be 5 or 6 on his left...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is nothing to suggest that 2@C or 2@H will play better from North's point of view. And you will be one level higher with no fit most likely|pg||
nt|nicksan: How about 1 NT?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Exactly. And you will have to score two tricks more to show a profit.|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Closed Room S bid 1N over a @c which is interesting|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Where are you going to get your tricks from in 1NT?|pg||
nt|nicksan: I can see an easy six from here...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, I don't think Alon can see his father's cards :)|pg||
nt|nicksan: let's hope not...|pg||
nt|brolucius: They don't allow mirrored sunglasses at the table.|pg||
nt|vugraphzux: They are playing with thick wood screens blocking the heads of their partners. even glasses wont help Alon here|pg||
nt|nicksan: if you're suggesting that South should run to his 4 card side suit, i don't agree. Running is up to North...|pg||
nt|brolucius: The thick wooden screens will protect North if he goes to the two-level and loses some big number.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sometimes it's a relief not being able to see your partner's face|pg||
nt|nicksan: Why the 2 level? North should RD and South bid 1 NT...|pg||

nt|andyv:  meanwhile, unto board 5:)|pg||
nt|lml: I see pluses and minuses to both but what I really hate is using 1M-2M as 3 card constructive raise|pg||
nt|bobholl: in bergen 3@C is a normal 2@S with 4 trumps|pg||

mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: rehi all|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i agree with that last comment linda|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: yes indeed it is|pg||
nt|ady: this is getting what is deserved   -4|pg||
nt|panja: showing an inability to bid higher, but an interest in doing so|pg||
nt|lml: on this hand it is better to find the 4-3 than the 5-2!|pg||
nt|lml: I like that lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  would prefer showing the majors with 4-5 pattern unless your pd is exceptional in 4-3 fits:)|pg||
nt|lml: when you have stuff play trump|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree. andy's point is that partner will bid the lower ranking suit with equal length|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the same principle applies to virutally all 2-suited bids when one suit is likely to be longer than the other|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kiwibridge: EW have forced them into their making slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that double of 5@S looks like penalty....not sure why North has removed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: trying to push them to 6@S lol|pg||
nt|haans: i think it was D0P1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or, if 4NT was Blackwood (of some kind), showing an even number of aces...in the sense that zero is even|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: long tank Levin|pg||
nt|haans: i say again 4nt tactical|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it was a great tactic Haans|pg||
nt|haans: yes he did right|pg||

nt|mdgraham: understandable|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: kibs are telling me he will bis 6@S|pg||
nt|haans: or pass or double|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6@S about -4|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: however, 5@S put a lot of oomph into the auction. Easy to imagine a slightly different layout where both his aces cash.|pg||
nt|haans: i do not think double if a choice|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6@S probably better than pass, but without 5@S probably no 6@D|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2imps on 2 and a flat board on 3 so the gap now a mere 76|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: ok nothing happened|pg||
nt|haans: diamond 3-0 may be a problem|pg||

pc|c5|nt|lml: what would you do on the West hand.  You could pass, double or bid 2@S if you don't like 2@D|pg||

nt|hedyg: need to cash the @H tricks|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think it is clear that the pass is forcing, assuming that 3C showed invitational or better values. S has forced at the 3 level, not at the 5 level. you CAN play the pass as ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: forcing by agreement, but it is not automatically so|pg||
nt|haans: low @H seems right|pg||

pc|h6|nt|panja: but NS have 10 in Spades, and EW have only 7 in Clubs..if NS cash their tricks in time|pg||
nt|hedyg: Panja send an email to LC :)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: fortunately for NS,on this hand S has a clear double regardless of how the partnership plays the pass by N|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Cindy|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   have balance    but for no more than a partial     2@C   or 1NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can understand the 3@C bid, but it certainly helped declarer. |pg||
nt|andyv:  easy 5@d bid for N|pg||
nt|lml: 6@D?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this is a hand where detailed agreements about methods over 4Sare important, but even without them you likely land on your feet|pg||

nt|marlowepi: it is crazy even to think about biudding here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W could have anything third in hand|pg||

nt|marlowepi: if you burn brain cells thinking oin this situatio n you will b e fried to a crisp long before the  match ends|pg||

nt|brolucius: We have just reached 1000 kibitzers at this table. I suggested a couple of years ago that a bugle-call sound effect would be appropriate, but the BBO programmers are a lazy bunch.|pg||

nt|ady: can afford to lose 3 trump tricks if losing nothing else     must surely ruff those losing clubs|pg||
nt|ady: see 4@S   went down in OR|pg||
nt|hedyg: tried that in OR and went -1, AK@D disc 1@H A@c , @c ruff, @H and @c ruff, A@H and @h ruff, overruff and K@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: still had to lose 1@c and 2@ss|pg||
nt|panja: how about xruf?|pg||
nt|hedyg: played it a lot faster than Ofir Herbst...still on break?|pg||
nt|ady: has to decide how to go back to hand   diamond ruff   or  heart ruff     was unlucky to get overruffed in hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzuw: thinking :P|pg||
nt|panja: @DAK discarding a @H, @CA, @C ruff, @HK, @Cruff, @HA ruff, @C ruff|pg||
nt|hedyg: after A@H there is no @c ruff|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the wrong hand then to ruff @c|pg||
nt|panja: well, @H ruff can be high..|pg||
nt|hedyg: with A@S?|pg||
nt|panja: y..but that is too double dummy a line..|pg||
nt|ady: if you win this   and A@C    club ruff    heart to the king and c lub ruff  then heart to the ace    cash 2nd dimond   if you play 3rd diamond   surely you make    but it is a ...|pg||
nt|ady: nasty guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: a bit too DD :)|pg||
nt|haans: spade lead hearts finesses = slam|pg||
nt|lml: its tough to make after the clun lead though|pg||
nt|lml: club|pg||
nt|lml: maybe not|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H back ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  fortunate lie of cards make 4@h an odds on favorite|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what am i missing? isnt this cold?|pg||
nt|lml: the heart play will depend on the rest of the hand|pg||
nt|lml: it is cold but it can go down |pg||
nt|andyv:  it is cold and N has few options|pg||
nt|lml: what happens on a heart lead now|pg||
nt|lml: for example|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ace wins and running ten wins|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @H back always down |pg||
nt|bobholl: sry not true|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|andyv:  when K@h falls, can just play @c off board|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: he has to rise here|pg||
nt|lml: this is the tricky part of the hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: had E led a low club, N would probably have ducked, but N was worried about spade shift|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is clear to rise|pg||
nt|lml: is it obvious to rise.  I was thinking about that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very unlikely that E would underlead heart king in this position|pg||
nt|bobholl: also with 26 cards in sigth :)|pg||
nt|lml: I am not so sure about that|pg||
nt|lml: why wouldn't he underlead|pg||
nt|bobholl: i meant a ? after the 26|pg||
nt|lml: lets say hearts are 2-2|pg||
nt|lml: is ducking right or rising?|pg||
nt|andyv:  not underleading from kx|pg||
nt|lml: I can see he isnt ... he has Jxx|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, playing A can't cost while ducking can|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for example, playing more clubs might kill dummy so that would be an option he would consider for a long time|pg||
nt|andyv:  also, if E started with Kxx, he may well have lead a trump|pg||
nt|lml: he might have|pg||
nt|lml: he might not too|pg||
nt|bobholl: he thinks long eneough about it :)|pg||
nt|lml: its hard|pg||
nt|bobholl: enough|pg||
nt|lml: and its the contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  i think it's almost automatic to lead trump from kxx in these auctions|pg||
nt|lml: this is where you should take time|pg||
nt|lml: I don't know.  Sometimes you have to cash your winners on preempt hands.  But maybe East hasn't read your book :)|pg||
nt|lml: I think he will get it right though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N is not wondering whether E has Kx of hearts (or Kxx). he is wondering whether to plkay W for KJx, which means throwing club on diamond and playing for spade finesse on|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|bobholl: this is ok now @C|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  now @c|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: will not see what line he choses|pg||
nt|sybarra: (maybe)|pg||
nt|ady: it is much easier  from here    no b lame atttached for going down|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
nt|lml: well done North|pg||
nt|lml: whatever he was thinking about :)|pg||
nt|lml: winning players get these things right and North is a winning player|pg||
nt|lml: I like this deal a lot.  I think it is blog worthy.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: rising was the correct play. if W had followed small, then he would have had to try the other line|pg||
nt|andyv:  E needed to lead a @c and @h at same time|pg||
nt|lml: I think with all the clues North had that rising was right and that is how North got there|pg||
nt|marlowepi: andy is putting it in his blog as we speak|pg||

nt|jcwla: Yup, after good lead by W.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: The N-S system (transferring the contract ot the stronger hand) showed to advantage. That's one to remember.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|nicksan: The Birman's have started bidding....bad timing though!|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Better to play Support Doubles and show the 3-card diamond support on the first round. Then North could compete when he held length in the suit.|pg||
nt|brolucius: ..on the second round, I meant.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Whatever double is -- I would have made it.|pg||
nt|mariner1: true S a tad short to be bidding 3@D red,,,,, lucky no dbl|pg||
nt|jcwla: But may show big hand in which case can't.|pg||
nt|othered1: a lot depends on your agreements about responding to 1@C|pg||
nt|nicksan: If there're any kids watching...it would be a good idea to leave the room now. This is an awful spot!|pg||
nt|mariner1: what about us big kids? :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't like 3@D too much. North could have competed with a double over 2@S if he had a fair point-count. |pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: he bid 3@D because partner has to play it|pg||

nt|jcwla: Put down dummy and "Would someone please turn the cards?  I have to use the little boys' room."|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Law of Total Tricks (or Total Trumps) suggests that South should go to 3@D on around half the points in the pack when there is a nine-card diamond fit. What reason did he have ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: for assuming that? |pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|s4|nt|othered1: agree that it was up to north to compete, if anyone.  Once south passes and denies raise to 2@D, bidding 3 is inconsistent.|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|brolucius: Even bidding 2@D on what he has (not recommended) would be better than passing and then bidding 3@D.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|othered1: When it works out, somehow, they call it "flair."|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 'Unassuming' as was the topic ysterday would be an excellent label for 3@D. "Do we have a fit or not, not sure"|pg||

nt|brolucius: Hah! Many thanks for telling us that.|pg||
nt|nicksan: Good thinking to take a break and re-group...|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS are in 1N here in Closed Room|pg||
nt|brolucius: If he thinks that is the first bad bid in the match, his memory does not extend to the session that I watched yesterday.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can reveal that N-S are not in 3@D in the other room. 1NT rather|pg||
nt|brolucius: They missed their diamond fit?|pg||

nt|lml: the oppos have 4 spades and a heart to casg|pg||
nt|lml: I think it is safe to play a heart|pg||
nt|lml: I am trying to think of when it costs?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is not safe but it is the best play|pg||
nt|lml: he could cash out his 4 tricks but I don't think the heart can cost.  the most the opps can take is 2 hearts and 4 spades.  He still gets 4 tricks|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think East can have 6 spades ?|pg||
nt|lml: he passed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thy have 2 already. 5 more is down one|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: very brave sandwich NT from S|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I fail to see the point of getting in with the South cards when you know it's not your hand. The risk is that you give the show away when the opponents take over anyway|pg||
nt|nicksan: South would probably be on lead against 4 @H...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I agree, he has shape and little else|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Obviously West's double did not show heart support, or I doubt that East would choose to defend.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: then why double on a relatively minimum opening?|pg||
nt|brolucius: A bit of a mystery.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|brolucius: North is giving his father a better dummy than his father gave him on the last deal.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not going to argue with success. The fact is, however, that this will go down and that 4@H would fail|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|othered1: might north have tried 2@D on the way to 2@S?  Or did south's 2@C show a preference for @C with XX implying better @S?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, hearts could have been 3-1 and 4@H would make, but then 2@C doubled would go for 500 at love all|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps he should redouble with equal length and bid 2@C with longer clubs. North has already declined to choose a suit.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h3|pc|dT|nt|othered1: might be an advantage to north's bidding @S -- Ew may be slightly less inclined to double them into game.|pg||

nt|andyv:  if I were E/W, I would have dbld 1N here...being down by 60+ you can't get hurt much worse and might be a substantial pick up.|pg||
nt|lml: some times people fight a bit too hard for partscores at imps and that is what happened in the OR.  South made a bad bid|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hedyg: oh well|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: that likely shows spades and a minor.  |pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: NS can make 5@D here|pg||

mb|p|nt|cindy:  on this bidding @d finesse rates to work|pg||
nt|lml: they have various names.  I play them|pg||
nt|lml: 2 of a major shows 5 in the major and 4 in a minor weak|pg||
nt|lml: not usually that weak|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then you won't want to hear my names for them:)|pg||
nt|lml: I play them as 5-5|pg||

nt|andyv:  W hand didn't scream loud enough for 3N|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  2nd from 5 bad leads|pg||
nt|marlowepi: easy to believe that those bids don;t prevent you from getting to slams. as for destruction, how about they goad the opps into bidding a game they would not otherwise bid, plus ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you've also given them a blueprint of how to make it when they otherwise would be favorites to go down. in my experience that is routine. but to each blogger his/her own:)|pg||

nt|andyv:  this will get nicked 1|pg||

nt|andyv:  no blueprint...4 losers no matter how you slice it|pg||
nt|lml: I know :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N of far more interest with a small @d lead from N|pg||
nt|lml: I was thinking about whether you can make 3NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  as cards lie, yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i can understand the appeal of those 2-bids when they show a real opening with shape, because then the odds that you will play the hand are much higher so the info about shape can ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: be very useful constructively. but when weak they just give so much free info away to the other side who are favorites to declare|pg||
nt|lml: the reason that I have found they work so well on those hands is the tradeoff between info and level is good|pg||
nt|lml: yes if the opponents still get to the right contract it can be helpful|pg||

pc|d8|nt|andyv:  lack of use?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  couldn't figure out what to do on it?|pg||
nt|lml: the only reson not to claim is to use up NOrth's brain cells|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, S passed originally, used a sandwich NT and then ran to 2@c which got dbld.|pg||
nt|andyv:  another overused and abused convention... the sandwich NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: IMAGINE passing that S hand :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i call it the baloney sandwich|pg||
nt|andyv:  as much as I like to bid, I'm usually happy to keep quiet when I have a 3 count|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you mean you dont want to show the opps your hand? not very sportinbg of you|pg||
nt|andyv:  actually, I don't like to show anyone those hands...not even the kibitzers:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  meanwhile, we have been put into the deep freeze by N|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably wondering if it's possible that pd bid on 2 points:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  in which case he might have to lead a low club:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: low club useless as he is marked with the ace due to dubious double|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|nicksan: This may very well end in 3 NT, which has to be played carefully...|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: well with KJ @c in pocket 3N seems to breeze in though|pg||
nt|nicksan: To answer your question Roland - I'm all in favour of getting in early...but wouldn't mind having a better suit...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer can duck the first round of clubs.|pg||
nt|othered1: south has a hand that's not easy to bid in standard systems|pg||
nt|nicksan: If he bids 3 NT he will have serious comunication problems...and a ton of work to do.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT seems to be his best bid on that hand.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has not shown a great hand, because he could have bid 2@S (forcing) on that.|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is how he would show a weakish hand with long spades.|pg||
nt|othered1: some play that you don't negative double on a 1-suiter, so there may be more inferences to south's auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Alon's problem re 3NT is if David showed anything about clubs. Could he not be 6223?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  probably a one rd force |pg||
nt|marlowepi: bob, i would say it this way: WHEN they gain, it would have to be in the bidding. still an open questio n what the longterm balance sheet is in high level competition|pg||
nt|lml: actually some times they do gain on defense too.  |pg||
nt|lml: information goes both ways|pg||
pc|dT|nt|andyv:  very little drama to this hand|pg||

nt|bobholl: which colour are you going to develop @H is the worst choice|pg||
nt|andyv:  and another big swing forn N/S as they didn't get to game on OR|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on previous hand, personally i think it automatic for W to bid game. for example, game failed by one on 4-0 break, so how bad was it?|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||

nt|lml: North can easily go down here|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree automatic to bid game...but, S balanced in 4th seat...knowing 10 of S's cards, a bad break in @hs is very likely, so 3N should be preferable.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hedyg: 8@C was treacherous lead, hard to guess long @cs in N|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d3|pc|sT|pg||

pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: amazing card to play|pg||

nt|nicksan: pachtman missing slightly in the defence - an immediate force, rather than the @S A, would have put South in diffculties...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: double may be the opposite of what many think: nothing in hearts|pg||

mb|p|nt|nicksan: Whatever double from North means...he hasn't got it!|pg||
pc|h5|nt|brolucius: North's double must show poor hearts and suggest that South looks elsewhere for his opening lead.|pg||

nt|bobholl: the 2 overtricks are not counting that much here but at MP would be near 99%|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: why double instead of 1NT?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  maybe 1N is something else|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: next up is Neil Young's Heart of Gold|pg||

nt|marlowepi: well then pass. you have no suit and 40% of yr stuff is in their suit, and both are red. |pg||
nt|andyv:  any reason to xfer with W hand over 1N?|pg||
nt|bobholl: the T of @H would have led me to 1nt indeed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: personally i wd bid 1NT in a nanosecond|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||

nt|mariner1: excellent job!!!|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mariner1: Our appreciation to the IBF (Ilan Shezifi), and all the generous sponsors and|pg||
nt|mariner1: organizers for helping BBO bring us the vugraphs!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, indeed. Well done!|pg||

mb|4S|nt|mariner1: also, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates, Sharon|pg||

nt|mariner1: worldwide!|pg||
nt|mariner1: special thanks to all the spectators, those comments and tips really do help us a|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: lot!|pg||
nt|nicksan: Time for Alon to get his bidding shoes on!|pg||
nt|brolucius: North: "It would be a bit timid to pass..."|pg||
nt|othered1: North has a decision, on which he's likely not going to get much help from south.|pg||
nt|mariner1: can they bid the grand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzux: Hope to see you all tomorrow in the final 3 segments (6-8) starting a hour and a half earlier than today|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd try 5@H then, if necessary, 6@H, and that might not be enough.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 9.00 Paris, 8:00 am London, 5:00 pm Sydney|pg||
nt|brolucius: He can bid 5@H for the moment and hope to hear 6@C. But South is barely worth 6@C perhaps.|pg||
nt|othered1: But at least I will have shown a real first round @H control.   Second choice, 6@H immediately, but trumps are so good that south will almost never go.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Another possible treatment is for North to (a) shut his eyes and (b) bid a grand slam. |pg||
nt|nicksan: Blackwood and then hope it's the right one?|pg||
nt|brolucius: South is surely favorite to hold the @CA after all.|pg||
nt|othered1: Down a bunch of imps, certainly the grand, which may be (and is on lie of cards) cold isn't silly.|pg||
nt|othered1: wouldn't it be nice to have an asking bid in @C (like some play 5@C over a 4@S opening)?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Assuming 4NT is Blackwood, South's ace is miles more likely to be in clubs.|pg||
nt|brolucius: And 954 BBO kibitzers will not be impresed by a 6@S contract on these cards. |pg||
mb|7S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: What about 5@C, then 5@H over the likely 5@D response. Then you will get 6@C eventually|pg||
nt|nicksan: Bravo!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Hurray! Well bid.|pg||
nt|othered1: Winning guess and one that was odds-on.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So much for science|pg||
nt|vugraphzux: It was you asking for a grand slam and not a poorly made 6@S+1|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he found a nice spot|pg||
nt|brolucius: 7@S must ask partner whether he holds the @CA.|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: hard for SA to find slam|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: is 4@D leaping michaels|pg||
nt|haans: leaping michaels|pg||
nt|lml: he was saving that for North|pg||
mb|5S|nt|kiwibridge: nice cue|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South won't like his @CKJx|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S natural if you have spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: with a very good view can make 6 @d but that is more than double dummy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think 5H is inadequate. why not 6H by N?|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't see them reach 7 now|pg||
nt|lml: he could bid it now|pg||
nt|lml: 6@h|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N knew in advance that S would bid 5S|pg||
nt|lml: he cant be worried about trump or he would bid 5NT so he is looking for something else|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@d now?|pg||
nt|lml: 6@D is okay if that is not a suit for certain|pg||
nt|lml: I would bid 6@H|pg||
nt|lml: see if partner can get there|pg||
nt|lml: or maybe just 7@S|pg||
nt|bobholl: only chance is guess 7 @S but guessing it is|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: would need to play for doubleton J@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: dont belive it|pg||
nt|vugraphzuw: me too :S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but North likes his hand....|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I prefer CRASH michaels 4@C shows the red suits, still well reached|pg||
nt|mdgraham: how did he know South had an ace? and four trumps?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perhaps there was more to 4@S than we know about|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed as these two seem to know EXACTLY what they are doing - top stuff indeed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Jim Gordon suggests 4@S was cue, as South was a passed hand|pg||
nt|haans: 4@D was not alerted|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I suggested that too|pg||
nt|haans: natural and 4@S cue?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which is all very reasonable|pg||
nt|andyv:  N didn't want to have an accident|pg||
nt|lml: I think 6@S is reasonable when you are up by a lot of imps anyway|pg||
nt|marlowepi: interesting. i weould think that is most important time not to miss a grand|pg||
nt|lml: well Birman finally got the swing hand they were looking for|pg||
nt|lml: a lot of the specs think North should have bid the grand|pg||
nt|lml: the argument is that there is nothing left for partner except more or less what he has|pg||
nt|bobholl: agree they will bid it at the other table :) !|pg||
nt|andyv:  at other table auction much quicker, N just bid 7@s over 4@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  so much for science:)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: and 11 more to Herbst. Getting really serious|pg||
nt|lml: I think North might have bid 7@S if he wasnt leading by so much|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: 2@s is 4sf, does not promise a stopper in @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 3@s by S now would ask for a stopper|pg||

nt|nicksan: Ah, sorry!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last 16 today, but another 48 tomorrow|pg||
nt|nicksan: That's better!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The winning team after 128 boards (8 segments of 16 boards) will be representing Israel at the European Championships in Ostend, Belgium, next summer|pg||
nt|nicksan: And I thought we might see some "wild" bridge...not yet then.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am hoping the saying 'Better late than never' applies here...|pg||
nt|nicksan: So Birman will be feeling a bit better after winning the last set...|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Ilan Shefizi for putting on a fine show.|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well, it is hard to know about hypotheticals, but i would assume that having a healthy lead is exactly the time you would bid a grand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Thanks to Hans Sjostrom (Sweden) and Gary Hanna (New Zealand) for commentary. I am Mike Graham (England). Also thanks to all spectators for some useful and perceptive comments. |pg||
mb|1D|nt|hedyg: hmmm this 6@d should be possible|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like a lot to do |pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: Congratulations to all of you who lasted the course.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: since the opps are likely to, particularly in a set tht hasnt hd that many opportunities for the trailing team|pg||
nt|bobholl: only argument is that the other table will be there too :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: play on @hs, let E make a @d by overruffing|pg||
nt|hedyg: then play AK@D, ruff 1 more @H, ruff 1@c and disc 1 @c on the last @H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|haans: more and more have seen it (open room closed long ago)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|marlowepi: well, that "only" argument is more than enough|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: hmm now what |pg||
nt|hedyg: usually the 3@d bid shows 4cards...|pg||

nt|sybarra: or 5 @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s was cuebid|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kiwibridge: thanks Mike and Haans it has been a pleasure, albeit a stretched out one|pg||
nt|haans: true |pg||

nt|lml: sorry |pg||
nt|lml: that was private|pg||

nt|marlowepi: chocolate cake is good BBO food|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s was natural in case N had 5/6 @d and 4 @ss|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably 5C over 3S would have been void-showing (possibly exclusion). otherwise it might be an appealing call|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Misunderstanding in the open room. South's jump to 3@C interpreted as promising a fit for hearts|pg||
nt|haans: herbst end it nice|pg||
nt|lml: right now I would eat most anything but spinach|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kiwibridge: will there be a concession or will I need more coffee for the next set :)|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|sybarra: now for the challenge |pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont think you can time it for making 6 |pg||
nt|hedyg: as "runnerup" says the line works if you play AK@D first as well|pg||
nt|marlowepi: seems fairlyu straightforward to make this by setting up hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: if you try ruffing 2@cs you are down|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: sometimes @hs are even 3-3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: well this should help|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont need 33 hearts|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: Emmylou just winked at me I think|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pg||
nt|hedyg: now just need @d split|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this lead gives declarer options, i.e. trying to cater to 4 trumps in the W hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: N knew from the 5 @H bid that S did not have the Q@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: but nowhere to go from the 5 @H level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you're making me jealous|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it worked for popeye|pg||

nt|marlowepi: Birman has broken into 3 figures|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 71 is still a LLLOOOOTTTT|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: aha, double for the majors. That's a rare bird, I think (no pun intended of course)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|brolucius: As I see it, you should always open 1NT when you are in range and have a 4-4-3-2 shape. Same with rebidding 1NT.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: you are playing winning bridge if you concede one-and-a-half imps a board. Half an imp per board is incredible.|pg||
