nt|kit: not that profitable a save if N-S get their diamond ruffs (vs. 5@C that is)|pg||

nt|kit: declarer must set up the spades to make this, and he has enough entries in the trump suit|pg||
nt|kit: east can see that even if he can force dummy with a diamond, declarer can still set up the spades -- so he might as well cash, sadly|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: I'm surprised South didn't bid 1NT -- he has to know that is probably best|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p!|nt|drorp:  Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: he may have intended to pass if north bid 1s|pg||
nt|kit: East may think his pass is forcing, but West isn't going to bid anything|pg||
nt|fabsayc: anyway he seems to have trapped ew|pg||
nt|kit: why would West even think of doing anything here opposite passed hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: well i dont open so i dont face these types of decisions often|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A bit puzzling that E passes but W opens?|pg||
nt|kit: This will be a struggle, but my guess is that it will scramble home|pg||

nt|rnmalik: would you go for 5@C-cards decently placed-friendly:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: there is spade ruff|pg||
nt|petergill: then Yilankaran 88, Neth Orange 86, Austria 84, Meyoukas 84, Aotearoa 83 but a 19-11 win moved them into the top eight, Neth Girls 83, Scotland U26 83, 21st Australia on 76, France ...|pg||
nt|petergill: on 76, other team's scores available by request|pg||
nt|sybarra: how many teams are in event, do you know peter?|pg||
nt|haans: @D lead = no make|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt with no good lead for N|pg||

mb|1S|nt|sharynr: oh, I am sure it shows minors BUT....|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: E make NS not bid slam?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: maybe it means i have jacks|pg||
nt|sharynr: one needs to HAVE the minors to show them at the 3 level, with no HCP|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no doubt on lead of A@S only|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Information.htm  for the tournament website, but Service Unavailable quite frequently I am sorry to say|pg||
nt|santyclz: A good hand for contructive jump shifts, a treatment we seldom see in the US.|pg||
nt|haans: after S pass you can act knowing THEY have game|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A bit careless then as two clubs can be ruffed with @sK and @sJ, losing only to @sQ|pg||
mb|4C|nt|garnetts: 4@D is better than 4@H here as it suggests defensive cards and helps West guage what to do if NS continue|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the web site seems unreachable whilst play is lon :(|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry that we cannot access the website so have to rely on locals at Yeditepe University in Istanbul providing info to us. |pg||
nt|haans: 3@C mean = do not lead clubs :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: nothing to the play expecta quick claim|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry Peter,  missed you said 40 teams|pg||
nt|iris100:  that carelessness cost 13 IMPs|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A tricky 4@s for N/S on this one as well|pg||
nt|iris100:  4@C wont cheer N up|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kiwibridge: we may have a flat board at last|pg||
nt|petergill: 40 teams, including some U21 teams|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C mini splinter|pg||
nt|haans: but also a warning to opps|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: sorry for connection problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: can they miss now|pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: K @h counted as a key card - so = 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 5nt = all + Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: cant miss now|pg||
nt|don paulus: 2 of the remaining 3 kings now|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: should bid 7nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he did|pg||
nt|iris100:  I donÂ´t think this will make|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: only bad if partner double|pg||
nt|ybob: 9@H is a nice card !!|pg||
nt|haans: and N have found a lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: you have no reason to lead clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: After 6 rounds, USA Blue lead on 130, Japan-Czech 2nd on 112 or 113 , Neth Red on 108, Greecour on 106, Italy Red 105, Aotearoa 102, 42 and others somewhere up there too|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|haans: a very easy grand to bid|pg||
nt|haans: claim before 1st trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: a very fast match|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes but maybe North did not bid enough|pg||
pc|d6|nt|haans: it did mean expect 4-1 in all suits|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|petergill: Jorrit Schafer from Belgium does not double, in case 6@S or 6NT is makeable|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: acdemic discussion-you see any chance for 5@D|pg||
nt|haans: W has 18 hcp that is also hard to understand|pg||
nt|don paulus: 4 @c 2 @h 2 @s 1 @d|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: we do have an optimistic Blair today |pg||
pc|s3|nt|kiwibridge: 4-0 break|pg||

nt|sharynr: i would think 5-0|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kiwibridge: but still possible|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: singel bids make it easy for defence  to defend. very rarely told|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: Blair's bidding was optimistic, and his card play excellent, when I partnered him in the San Francisco Nationals about 20 months ago. |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|haans: :)|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  It has chances still I think|pg||

pc|s6|pc|c9|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|haans: 31C cannot have been gf|pg||
nt|sybarra: to me,  3 @S would have been the "bigger" slam interest hand |pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: Blair usually plays a Strong Club system, but when playing with Luke Gardiner or Luke's mother Val or me, he play our natural-based system|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d8|nt|don paulus: extra @c now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|iris100:  how? @CQ doesnt hold|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzus: i guess 3 cl bid was pscyhic|pg||
nt|petergill: A bit lucky to drop only 5 imps there|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like a splinter to me |pg||
nt|haans: if psych you bid 3@D instead|pg||
nt|sybarra: or mini splinter, but I dont like it with Jxx of @D|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|s9|nt|vugraphzus: east has pitched a @D early .so it made +2|pg||
pc|sT|pg||

mc|8|nt|iris100:  down 2|pg||
nt|iris100:  what happened? how did N make another trick?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  One extra diamond ruff in hand earlier and declarer could have made A9 of spades at the end|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3-3 @Ds and the @H finesse  means this succeeds|pg||
nt|kit: doesn't really need heart finesse I don't think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he already has nine on layout without any finesses|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True 1@C 5@D and 2 Aces|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: @HK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so lazar made a good return actually|pg||
nt|kit: remember, he doesn't know diamonds are coming in -- so from his point of view he has 3 diamonds, 2 hearts, 2 spades, 1 clubs = 8|pg||
nt|kit: With possible diamond heart squeeze for  9 if diamonds don't split|pg||
nt|kit: so if East returns a spade, proper technique is ace of spades, ace of hearts, ace of diamonds, heart to king, cash black winners, and see what happens|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Lots of possibilities and they all work|pg||

nt|petergill: 2@D = one long major|pg||

pc|c5|nt|sharynr: but we have seen thay East likes to bid....so lets see how she plays now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no great number of @C tricks and entries will be few|pg||

pc|cA|nt|cherdano:  good slam but not that easy to bid over the interference by EW|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  Easy nine tricks when diamonds break evenly and maybe 10 if declarer guesses which major suit finesse to take|pg||
pc|c7|nt|cherdano:  and it was easily bid by Italy at the other table without interference|pg||

nt|sybarra: ML defense to nt is just like ML opening,  @D= one long major and 2 @C = stayman and 2 of either major is that  5 card of that major and a minor|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kiwibridge: here is the bad news|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or had a go at 6@C only failing on the awful break|pg||
pc|cK|nt|petergill: multilandy = 2@C for majors (Landy) and 2@D like a multi two opening, with 2M = 5+M and either 4+minor|pg||
nt|haans: or 4 cards in M + longer minor|pg||
nt|petergill: I make a good echo. :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)  at least the specs now know |pg||
nt|sybarra: btw Ilike it also |pg||
nt|petergill: This should go down, especially if declarer plays a spade to the king (likely, normal)|pg||

pc|cT|pg||
nt|sybarra: now can roll home |pg||
nt|sybarra: as long as declarer does try a early @D |pg||
nt|don paulus: complete misfit and "only" 31 pts|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|drorp:  tough rebid here, i know americans like 2@S with those hands|pg||
nt|kit: so true -- and 6@S is doomed|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|kit: the 2@C bid may slow North down|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp:  they should be staying out of slam now, no way north can dream on a slam after partner rebid 2@c|pg||
nt|kit: Even after the 3@S jump, North is looking at too many wrong cards I think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hand is all wrong for a direct 2@S raise, spades bad, hand too good|pg||
nt|kit: and RKC will identify the problem if North is willing to drive to slam|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|kit: good judgment -- hard to construct a hand you want to be in slam where partner rebid 2@C|pg||
nt|drorp:  partner has the best possible hand and slam is about 15%, so no way north can bid anything other than 4@s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes I think the 2@C rebid sets the right tone for the rest of the auction|pg||
nt|drorp:  south is now thinking maybe he made an overbid on the 2nd bid so now he'll try to save the day with his 7 control hand?|pg||
nt|drorp:  underbid*|pg||
nt|vugraphzut: South is thinking |pg||
nt|kit: Thinking on South's hand is an overbid -- if there were slam, surely North would at least have Q-bid something|pg||
nt|drorp:  i doubt N would cuebid if he had the same hand +T9 spade, but still, kinda un disciplined to think now, did partner promise more than 10 points?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N is in charge of this auction and the failure to cue should stop S thinking|pg||
nt|kit: the point here is that South has limited his hand, and North is the captain.  North has said absolutely no slam, and south should respect that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: how about north has spade king, no heart king, slam is ok then|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: sure you can construct hands where slam is okay, but still South must pass|pg||

nt|garnetts: death trap for NS here |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: north seems excited with his hand:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes could get too high in @D|pg||
nt|petergill: I think South should duck the first spade, that solves the problem, as declarer will surely play the king. |pg||
nt|haans: no but 3nt with 16 hcp after a jump?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: north pitched a club .so it makes +2|pg||
nt|iris100:  quite boring boards - another standard game|pg||

nt|haans: here we may fi9nd why 3nt. they use Big Clubs|pg||
nt|haans: so 3@H was weaker that i belived|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They may think about slam on this one but need to identify the poor trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  so would be a good safe, but only if you are sure 6@S is making|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: against 6 @S i meant|pg||

mb|1S|nt|cherdano:  sorry|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: but not now after only 1@D --what do you need these days for 2@C opening|pg||
mb|2C|nt|cherdano:  i would just bid 2@H at red/white and with @SKxxx|pg||
nt|sybarra: do they play wk nt Peter? |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: i think east REALLY likes to bid!|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yeah.very|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|petergill: Bd 5: Luke Gardiner gave correct upside down count in @d's with @D7, and playing a heart back instead of a club was reasonable, so no need for a post mortem. |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: correct bid as per Blue team in the 60th|pg||
nt|sharynr: would be nice to have DBL mean "takeout or leave it in partner, you can do both"|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: no big decisions|pg||
nt|haans: soon @D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@S on the 4-3 was very well done other room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H 4@S NS-another flat I think|pg||
nt|haans: to slow to show spade void |pg||
nt|iris100:  But as even 5@S makes|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kiwibridge: OR did go via 1@S but still reached 4@H last one|pg||
nt|sybarra: same auction as other table |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: or a failing 3N :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: takes the punt ouch|pg||
nt|petergill: 10-12 NT at this vul and position|pg||

mb|4S|nt|garnetts: Not that bad a bid just that bad a result|pg||
nt|ybob: now 7@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|ybob: can E bid 5@H if 4@S cue ????|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: :)|pg||

nt|ybob: maybe regular KCA|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  declarer has to be a bit careful here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D lead difficult|pg||
nt|petergill: Good lead by Andy Hung, better than say @DK|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North realizes South has heart shortage so the hands fit badly|pg||

nt|garnetts: have a lot of sympathy---the 6@D bid shows character and understanding |pg||
nt|garnetts: Should get the clubs right after this |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Strange defense Likely to end play himself|pg||

mb|2D|nt|fabsayc: diamonds come in for 2 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: it can make by going after diamonds, but going after hearts looks more natural I think|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: But in the meantime ?|pg||
nt|drorp:  2@s-3NT now?|pg||
nt|kit: very conservative 2@h call, which should end the auction|pg||
nt|ritong: north has an obvious 2@s now|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|kit: yes, sorry, I guess he does|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: never mind kit  after all, i m french too:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: even canucks eventually raise with north hand|pg||

nt|ritong: well, it is not a raise, fundamentally a complete description|pg||
nt|ritong: 3541 zone 2|pg||
nt|kit: as pointed out declarer can come do 9 tricks going after diamonds.  But that needs the spades to come in also.  So playing for 3-3 hearts seems to me to be better|pg||

nt|fabsayc: well this line is worse than either plan we suggested|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kit: he can still set up a spade trick|pg||
nt|ritong: or exit @d & @d and reach the ending with @ss|pg||
nt|ritong: which would include a guess if the defender plays a top @s|pg||
nt|kit: or a more unfortunate ending if diamonds 4-2 and defenders cashed 7 tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: so i think he will play @s 10 and let it go|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|kit: might have been interesting if West had covered 10 of spades (which he probably should) ....|pg||

nt|cherdano:  but here North was so weak (no points in partner's suits) that he shouldn't mind playing 2@C|pg||

nt|garnetts: This is because a blind lead often gives away a crucial trick--so cash and ace to get a look|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: fair enough|pg||

nt|haans: you came to a GRAND|pg||
nt|don paulus: we saved a grand for you :)|pg||
nt|haans: good opps bidding|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is a lot of spades to bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: Also some practiced pairs reverse their normal lead structure against pre-empts--K from AK and the lead of an ace requires an attitude signal|pg||
nt|sybarra: does he X?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he is thinking|pg||
nt|petergill: in Adams' 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - answer to the ultimate question about the meaning of life = 42, for those even more illiterate than me |pg||

nt|sybarra: not sure he wants to give the hand away |pg||
nt|petergill: Operator, are you sure that East di not dbl?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cherdano:  declarer will probably take this trick, cross to a diamond, and take a spade finesse|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: or "bettering" the contract, same level |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|santyclz: Discussion hand.  In your partnership does the 2@h bid imply @d support or tend to show @d shortage?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I wouldnt  with E east hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes|pg||
nt|haans: if he pass W cannot bid anymore|pg||
pc|sA|nt|don paulus: keeps ops out of 7|pg||

nt|garnetts: Is west getting desperate ?  4@H ?  |pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Basar|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  Winning the spade doesn't help as dummy has no entry|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Declarer now has to guess spades though East's opening bid will help|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kiwibridge: excellent J@C|pg||
nt|garnetts: Great card by South|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H first natural bid by opener|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|h7|pg||

pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: The system they are playing. If 2@D natural then 2@H natural too|pg||
nt|sybarra: since not match points,  why bother with jxx of @D |pg||
pc|h4|nt|rnmalik: Did you meet Masood Salim, his Partner. Walking computer|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we've lost some comparisons in that break|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: i will put in scores shortly|pg||
nt|garnetts: maximum hurt here now n|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kiwibridge: I was scoring at the far eastern in Auckland 1976, Zia in black velvet and much gold chains|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NS on the ball and well rewarded|pg||
nt|garnetts: Self inflicted wound though|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kiwibridge: a magnet for the ladies :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: losing finesse |pg||

pc|sK|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: what was 2S? 3 controls?|pg||
nt|haans: i do not belive 4nt was an option for E|pg||

pc|h3|nt|vugraphzus: west seems upset after looking at dummy|pg||
nt|haans: i do belibve that 3 controls|pg||
pc|d4|pc|cT|pg||
nt|don paulus: do not like singelton trump lead - but other leads may give a trick away|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cherdano:  well declarer had other ideas|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh yes but important to extract the max damage|pg||

pc|d6|pc|c6|pg||
nt|haans: doing good|pg||

nt|vugraphzus: after 4nt he can ask extras with 5nt .and he will get @d K for grand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then W should bid 5N as a grand slam try over 5H. not practical to play it specifically as Josephine by 2C opener|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we are playing 10 boards here.|pg||
nt|petergill: so this is a good board for New Zealand (NS)|pg||
nt|haans: natural to bid 4@H going down|pg||

nt|iris100:  4@H by W has some chances|pg||
nt|iris100:  nasty lead for N|pg||

nt|haans: do not understand what 4@S mean?|pg||

nt|don paulus: surprising result on board 16 : 6 @s X !|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharynr: should not expect a @S fit |pg||

nt|rnmalik: yes pl|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt coming up some how |pg||

pc|hK|nt|haans: you can play 5nt as Q ask|pg||

nt|vugraphzus: u welcome:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: does W sit?|pg||
nt|haans: do you agree with that peter?|pg||
nt|petergill: His mother makes the same sorts of pressure bids when she plays with me - putting max pressure on EW early in the bidding, giving EW the last guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am not sure W can sit |pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H is cold for 620|pg||
nt|haans: go back on hand. DID YOU p X THEN?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not that it makes much of an imp difference.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S looks likt transfer to clubs |pg||
nt|petergill: West might take the Dbl as values instead of pure penalty|pg||
nt|petergill: as he has done!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kiwibridge: 2@C = any game force?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good old gazillie|pg||
nt|don paulus: - 6 = 1400 wins an imp :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cherdano:  and meanwhile 5 IMPS to Italy, as North found a more successful @H lead at the other table|pg||
nt|haans: can anyone tell all scores|pg||
nt|iris100:  1@H, 3@C and a spade, thats it for N|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: she did not jump|pg||
nt|sharynr: Once again, a touch too high|pg||
nt|petergill: A good coup by Luke Gardiner, making EW guess, and they have now guessed wrongly|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|haans: but no jumping from E :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: too bad, 3nt would have been better|pg||
nt|don paulus: good action by S|pg||
nt|haans: all i can say is HOLY ...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Still, -200 is better than -620|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: maybe. 2H going down. in my view it is better and safer to act initially on the S hand|pg||
nt|haans: me 2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: even in this sequence-looking for @S check I think|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kiwibridge: looks like Noname have a decent win here barring a disaster on 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: S not wanting N to bid again!|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|cherdano:  2N 18-19 balalnced, 3@D transfer, 3@S superaccept i assume|pg||
nt|garnetts: slam needs both major suits to break 3-2 with an extra residual chance in spades and the club ace right or led |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: and some more greek speech |pg||
nt|sybarra: that could be right also |pg||
nt|iris100:  but you wont make 4!E from E|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d6|nt|cherdano:  after @CAK and seeing the heart break, declarer can endplay South|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: seems that way.i couldnt read notes|pg||
nt|iris100:  4@H|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cherdano:  so he won't need the @D finesse|pg||
nt|sharynr: yes, kib suggests a trump back to let declarer do all the owrk|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|iris100:  as N doesnt follow 3 rounds of @D|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petergill: The vulnerability was vital to North's decision to bounce the auction. He knew EW have 8+ @H's if South has only 4 spades. |pg||
pc|c9|nt|sharynr: work*|pg||
nt|don paulus: would you then prefer 2 @c over dbl ? with only 3 @s ?|pg||

pc|cT|nt|nigel_k:  Yes, slightly lucky escape for E/W then|pg||
pc|h4|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Possibly their defence to 1NT left West with no option other than pass|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i prefer double, since S lacks club ten|pg||

nt|kit: they might get to 3@S doubled after this undisciplined call|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True|pg||
nt|mcarroll: E has done a lot of bidding with very little|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well that seems to be norths intent, something i doubt many pairs have discussed however|pg||
nt|kit: East bid his hand with his 1NT call.  He should shut up.|pg||

nt|ritong: absolutely right, but he could not resist trying to bother opps|pg||

mc|10|nt|kit: something which happens more often than is realized|pg||
nt|mcarroll: No interference bidding in Closed so a "mundane" 3NT being played - ah well|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kit, he could not protect against 4-0, the defense can tap dummy to assure second trump trick|pg||
nt|ritong: i think so too|pg||
nt|funtay: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/VGData/minirama.html live running scores|pg||
nt|ritong: besides, if he plays for 4/0 trumps, he can try to discover who has the @h A|pg||
nt|ritong: when it is west, the whole picture is on after the @s K lead|pg||
nt|ritong: although he could pitch a @s on the @c A|pg||
nt|ritong: so, no tapping|pg||
nt|fabsayc: as played west wins diamond king and taps dummy before the pitch|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, but would you do that?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is it hard, i dont think so|pg||
nt|fabsayc: partners shape is known|pg||
nt|ritong: pard bid 3@s with nada, is not impossible he holds 6 of them|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well if he is really 65 and did not overcall 1s, but that is pretty unlikely|pg||
nt|ritong: well is over  merci a tous|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and why would declarer lay down club king unless seeking a pitch|pg||

nt|petergill: Credit that 9 imp gain to Luke Gardiner's daring but sensible tactical bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: thx all last board now.i hope you are enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The defence dropped a trick so 3 imps to N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: I have another in the evening that is my time|pg||
nt|garnetts: Thanks all and have fun--bye for now |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also to Peter and Hans my co commentators. great fun guys! |pg||
nt|ybob: lucky 6@D here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|haans: long way to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  NS can make grand slam|pg||
nt|cherdano:  in several strains|pg||
nt|cherdano:  but 6@C is the best contract|pg||
nt|sharynr: A multi opening|pg||
nt|garnetts: well after this |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I guess it's lunch time Basar?|pg||
nt|haans: ty :))|pg||
nt|rgdruru: and 6@s|pg||

mb|1H|nt|vugraphzus: last bord was just made.fixed it now|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes its:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  is 3S general strength, or does it show clubs?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: welcome back:)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well Japan_Czech will enjoy theirs :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: yuck --not a great spot |pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to the WBF for organizing and bringing this to bbo   we LOVE seening the jrs. ! |pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, thanks Basar and thanks to the organisers in Istanbul such as Murat Molva and Ata Aydin.  |pg||
mb|2D|nt|cherdano:  slam will be difficult to find now|pg||
nt|garnetts: but curiously the spades mean it will play OK|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: i agree |pg||
nt|rnmalik: action board again|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: not available|pg||
nt|iris100:  possible 3SA on the last one|pg||
nt|iris100:  but i think it goes down on a @S lead and @C switch on the third trick|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharynr: zig and zag|pg||
nt|santyclz: Awfully heavy for a weak jump, maybe intermediate?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx specs for your informative and funny comments, we love them |pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: re-hi|pg||
nt|haans: hi|pg||
nt|petergill: A low heart lead????|pg||
nt|haans: lead low @H = make|pg||
nt|petergill: More daring bidding by NS gives Andy Hung a lead problem|pg||
nt|haans: u first|pg||
nt|petergill: the textbooks say 4th best from this holding|pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: surprising result board 27 !|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: first blood of this match|pg||
nt|don paulus: y|pg||
nt|sybarra: might even have trouble making 4 |pg||
nt|rnmalik: that should be the contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: ak of clubs, ruff, and ace of hts |pg||
nt|rnmalik: less damage|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  A nasty guess in diamonds awaits declarer as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: this is last board of the round thx everyone|pg||
nt|iris100:  but then, you just give up a @D|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cherdano:  meanwhile, 3@S would have been down 5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a fun match, next round starts in 45 minutes, thanks Basar great operating and thanks Rashed and Salim|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|petergill: Luke Gardiner did well to make himself declarer - now can he get the clubs right?|pg||
nt|haans: 10-12 nt win lots because opps not know what to bid|pg||
nt|rgdruru: i guess 6 @D i pretty hard to reach, especially after nt opening|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rgdruru: not that it should be bid|pg||
nt|haans: nore logical that NT-bidder have @DK|pg||
nt|haans: as logical as @CA|pg||
nt|rgdruru: even so, both 3nt and 6 @D are down if k @D on W|pg||
nt|haans: yep so better slam has been missed|pg||
nt|ybob: S made that opening works|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|haans: game|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rnmalik: Gary no swings in borad 10, so Noname comfortable winners:)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|petergill: EW lead low = like I think, attitude leads versus NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: wow!   ed |pg||
nt|sybarra: wd |pg||
nt|haans: not better that max 50%|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|santyclz: The open room reached 5@c on bd 29 on what looks very much like a bidding misunderstanding.|pg||
nt|sybarra: optimist!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rnmalik: @CA|pg||
pc|d7|nt|haans: its been a good mstch|pg||
nt|haans: match|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sharynr: opps had to get @C started to defeat a game|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes a good win, have fun later I see you are on with Shirley she is good fun|pg||
nt|haans: time to claim|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|cherdano:  and maybe double by North would have actually been the best bid|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, 1-1 clubs was indicated by EW's silence in the bidding - with a club void, West might have bid over 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: this is the last board of the match.thx all see you tomorrow|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|haans: must ruff a @H|pg||
nt|iris100:  now itÂ´s 12 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|cherdano:  if partner passes it is great|pg||
nt|cherdano:  if he bids 3N nothing is lost|pg||
nt|sybarra: % play?  to hop ace  |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  That was fast, I think I would still have been thinking|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzus: thx all.see you soon|pg||
