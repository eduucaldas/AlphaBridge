nt|iris100:  made 12 tricks in the open room|pg||
nt|iris100:  11|pg||
nt|iris100:  only small @S lead (not very likely) holds it to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|wygbe1: south can do the same by winning in hand, cashing d ace, and leading a spade - setting up the spade suit with ruffs, as h are 22|pg||

nt|ybob: 4@S looks fine|pg||
nt|han: North played his lowest spade every time|pg||
nt|han: so I think south was wrong to play a diamond|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if he'd played @D earlier the no @S loser but worried about @C's|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes had some options |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Aotearoa is Kuke Gardiner from Wanganui, NZ, Blair Fisher from Hamilton NZ, Michael Whibley from New Zealand, and Michael's partner is from Argentina. |pg||
nt|petergill: Luke|pg||
nt|wygbe1: light opening by east|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|haans: do not hard cards for 6@D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: part score here. NS may reach 4@H but.....................|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a quiet part score to let the nerves settle|pg||
mb|2D|nt|don paulus: another 3 nt - EW this time|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|don paulus: y favourable @c split|pg||
nt|sybarra: precision type 1 @D |pg||
nt|chick: yes, if @Cs were 4-4, he could lose the @DQ, @SJ and @C for -1.  in the end, I think he just figured that was true no matter how he played, and just finessed and hoped|pg||
mb|d!|nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|iris100:  in first seat vul. ... I donÂ´t like it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: any 11 will do not my cup of tea|pg||
mb|2S|nt|haans: what is showing and what is asking|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: X by S 2@S by W should end it|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Joe WLC|pg||
nt|don paulus: may pass out now|pg||
nt|sybarra: not mine either |pg||
nt|chick: it's at least a point short of opening by my standards, too|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: west alerted its majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|rnmalik: Pass would do them good.|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: that is my choice|pg||
nt|santyclz: (Rashed), sry.|pg||

mb|3N|nt|haans: an other fast claim?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: We are meeting now:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: We can guess, any game force, bal min, relay, ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think Visser can bid 3 nt now |pg||
nt|petergill: The Argentina youth flew from Argentina to New Zealand, then to Turkey, so is probably the most travelled competitor in the field. |pg||

nt|haans: nothing to see or miss|pg||
nt|don paulus: we got the result - thats fine|pg||
nt|sybarra: tremendous number of frequent flyer miles!|pg||
nt|petergill: If played by East, a heart lead would shoot 3NT. |pg||
nt|han: East can now hold it to 4|pg||
nt|han: by playing a low heart|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a crazy auction to say the least :)|pg||

nt|rnmalik: all roads lead to 11|pg||

nt|rnmalik: excellent point and resultantly 5@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: could be a double game swing or n/s having tpo save in 5s|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|hK|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats why we have unusual and michaels etc there is a reason|pg||

nt|don paulus: guess flat board unless NS decide to bid 4 @h or @s other room|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt down if silent|pg||
nt|rnmalik: action hand|pg||
nt|haans: bloody deal|pg||
nt|sybarra: action hand here |pg||
nt|petergill: An action hand |pg||
nt|don paulus: it was all limit and all key cards favourable|pg||
nt|iris100:  2@C was the contract in the other room|pg||
nt|han: if east had had a doubleton club it would have been down|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|santyclz: This hand has some action potential.|pg||
nt|haans: we all say the same :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|iris100:  standard 4@S now|pg||
nt|han: I guess that was impossible, east would need to have 2362 shape and west wouldn't have a 2D raise|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|don paulus: 2 @h NS ?|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|haans: 3@D max|pg||
nt|petergill: EW will bid to 4@S, Blair Fisher will bid 5@D, then what?|pg||
nt|haans: slam in spades|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S Michaels, 5/5 spades and a minor|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think to 5 @H by n/s|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S EW|pg||
nt|han: East can double now to show values|pg||
nt|sybarra: this look lebensohlish by Cam |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: 1st board a push|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H I mean|pg||
nt|sybarra: in tempo pls.  5 @H |pg||
nt|haans: 6@S please|pg||
nt|han: the doubleton spade is about perfect for the double|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|haans: how to make opps pass|pg||
nt|garnetts: Interesting choice by East--but if 1@C is nebulous it is probably best to pass|pg||
nt|haans: 7@H good sac|pg||
nt|petergill: Blair might bid 5@C or 5@D or 5@H, I'm not sure which|pg||
nt|sybarra: there is the lead director |pg||
nt|wygbe1: i would think south is worth 2s, and n has easy raise to 4|pg||
nt|han: I think 2S is a very bad call|pg||
nt|han: but E may know better|pg||
nt|chick: apparently so|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: not right|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we're back|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@C cue is his choice, as a slam try|pg||

nt|tweety1: dbl cld be better|pg||
mb|3S|nt|garnetts: I really do not like that with only four hearts|pg||

nt|petergill: Luke bids 6@C, in case they have a 4-4 club fit with his @d losers able to be discarded on the long @H's |pg||
nt|haans: looks like 6@S will be the end|pg||
nt|petergill: Andy Hung now thinks that partner has @D's!|pg||
nt|haans: after a cue cannot sac|pg||
nt|petergill: The lack of entries to dummy makes the play of @H contracts difficult|pg||
nt|haans: if hung x no 6@S|pg||
nt|petergill: Andy Hung is one of the stars of Australian youth bridge - he has won international youth events such as the Pacific Asia Teams playing for Australia|pg||

mb|p|nt|han: this would make it easier for west to bid 4S though|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: nothing |pg||
nt|sybarra: nothing wrong with 5 clubs is there?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  1@s is not enough with South, maybe she was considering 3@s|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North will raise to game anyway|pg||
nt|iris100:  for a junior, 2@S is quite disciplined|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning Roland, Veysel, Han and everyone|pg||
nt|tweety1: hello Andy|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@C makes|pg||
nt|chick: this can be set, but sure not obviously enough to warrant a double|pg||
mb|5S|nt|haans: but close to something|pg||
nt|sharynr: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: forcing pass by Andy?|pg||
nt|haans: if NS find there 8 @H EW more likely to find spades|pg||
nt|don paulus: interesting lead for declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes!|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: 2-2 in M do not like|pg||
nt|rnmalik: but only 8 tricks on @D lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|chick: ummm, yes you are right, can set up hearts for the losing diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: yes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we lost our score from board 2|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: and got away with it|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: Great 6@S bid by Andy Hung|pg||
nt|ybob: 8 tricks cold|pg||
nt|han: declarer worries about diamonds being 3-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Note that even with two aces, Blair Fisher has the discipline not to double 6@S|pg||
nt|haans: does not need @DK right but no @D lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@S is a good sac over 5@C, won't get a good score tho :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharynr: but looks like a good hand for vul save|pg||

pc|c4|nt|kiwibridge: defense error = 8+ to ckis|pg||

nt|han: Egypt and Noname are currently ranked 16th and 18th, and to get to the top 8 they could really need a big score this round|pg||

nt|Walddk5: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Information.htm  for the tournament website, but Service Unavailable quite frequently I am sorry to say|pg||
nt|santyclz: A good hand for contructive jump shifts, a treatment we seldom see in the US.|pg||
nt|haans: after S pass you can act knowing THEY have game|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A bit careless then as two clubs can be ruffed with @sK and @sJ, losing only to @sQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  these first few hands aren't helping either of them|pg||
mb|2S|nt|garnetts: 4@D is better than 4@H here as it suggests defensive cards and helps West guage what to do if NS continue|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the web site seems unreachable whilst play is lon :(|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry that we cannot access the website so have to rely on locals at Yeditepe University in Istanbul providing info to us. |pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: nothing to the play expecta quick claim|pg||

nt|iris100:  that carelessness cost 13 IMPs|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A tricky 4@s for N/S on this one as well|pg||
nt|iris100:  4@C wont cheer N up|pg||
nt|chick: Must be terrible pressure on teenagers to know the whole bridge world is watching them play.   Then to add a disaster can only make it worse.  |pg||
nt|sybarra: frankly, these kids love it! |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: we may have a flat board at last|pg||
nt|petergill: 40 teams, including some U21 teams|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: can they miss now|pg||
nt|han: North has 11 HCP, but they look so bad|pg||

nt|sybarra: you shouid have seen them at DC Nationals |pg||

nt|ybob: 9@H is a nice card !!|pg||
nt|haans: and N have found a lead|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|haans: you have no reason to lead clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: After 6 rounds, USA Blue lead on 130, Japan-Czech 2nd on 112 or 113 , Neth Red on 108, Greecour on 106, Italy Red 105, Aotearoa 102, 42 and others somewhere up there too|pg||
nt|han: I wonder what 3@c is, I would have bid 4@c with the south hand (splinter with 4 trumps) but maybe NS can show that hand in a different way|pg||
nt|han: Operator, can you find out what these bids mean for us?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|haans: a very easy grand to bid|pg||
nt|haans: claim before 1st trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: a very fast match|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes but maybe North did not bid enough|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: it did mean expect 4-1 in all suits|pg||
nt|andyv:  S is only a 12 count and N did pass originally, so jumping to 4@c seems a bit optomistic|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: they are just whispering.cant hear them .sorry|pg||
nt|tweety1: 2nt shows strenght here i guess|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|petergill: Jorrit Schafer from Belgium does not double, in case 6@S or 6NT is makeable|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rnmalik: acdemic discussion-you see any chance for 5@D|pg||
nt|haans: W has 18 hcp that is also hard to understand|pg||
nt|don paulus: 4 @c 2 @h 2 @s 1 @d|pg||
nt|han: yes good point Andy, in that case I would just bid 4@h|pg||
nt|han: I think it is impossible to stop in 3@h with the south hand once north moves over 2@h|pg||
nt|tweety1: 4 @c or +h may seem attractive but remember your pd is a passed hand|pg||
nt|tweety1: NS knows that they have 23 hp max|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: we do have an optimistic Blair today |pg||
nt|tweety1: umm 3 @c is a great bid then|pg||
nt|tweety1: N shd have stop at 3 level with a mass hand like his..|pg||
nt|han: I don't agree unless NS have a way to show a club splinter below 3@h, which I strongly doubt|pg||
nt|andyv:  have to play @hs for one loser...since W needs to be kept out of lead after @d shift, probably need to dbl hook the @hs|pg||

mb|4S|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Arend Bayer|pg||

nt|rnmalik: brave bid of 2NT-no negative DBL|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: south alerted 3 cl but not north|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Juan from Argentina let 1NT go, but Andy bids 2@D Multilandy|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cherdano:  do we know whether NS have an agreement about 4@H?|pg||
nt|sharynr: would 1NT not be enough?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes and 3@S?|pg||
nt|garnetts: very marginal game at best|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes |pg||
nt|garnetts: I think that North should bid 4@S ---very prime 17 for a suit|pg||
nt|chick: 11 IMPs if they make this |pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: what would 1nt has showed|pg||
nt|haans: sry|pg||
nt|sharynr: this hand i believe|pg||
nt|garnetts: North would have done better to call 1@S and investigate over the 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good for morale : thanks pard I am min ; np I'll bid my hand again|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D = one long major|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt was massive bidding :(|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharynr: but we have seen thay East likes to bid....so lets see how she plays now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no great number of @C tricks and entries will be few|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he write some notes.cant see it|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cherdano:  good slam but not that easy to bid over the interference by EW|pg||
nt|rnmalik: to me it does not make-@H lead no entry no 3rd entry|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H pass or correct|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|sharynr: This must be very exciting for the players, coming together to Istanbul!|pg||
nt|haans: may be hard for them to play their best bridge|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: needs @S switch now|pg||
nt|sybarra: the dbl gives som clues |pg||
nt|sybarra: but is it enough |pg||
nt|haans: multilandy are the hottest thing around just now|pg||
nt|tweety1: ah|pg||
nt|chick: I know we're not supposed to have favorites when commentating, but I sure can't help cheering for a 13 year old, regardless of country :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1 @D entry to play Q@S game over|pg||
pc|hA|nt|santyclz: Well, it can make.  W has to guess 4-1 rather than 5-0.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h7|nt|sybarra: I think the "girls" are not much old if at all |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he didnt cover 9 |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well done|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the cold 4@H was doubled for 7 away last board|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Easy nine tricks when diamonds break evenly and maybe 10 if declarer guesses which major suit finesse to take|pg||
nt|tweety1: refused 1 more imp:)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cherdano:  and it was easily bid by Italy at the other table without interference|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: seems 7 |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: 7@d is good save |pg||
nt|sybarra: ML defense to nt is just like ML opening,  @D= one long major and 2 @C = stayman and 2 of either major is that  5 card of that major and a minor|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kiwibridge: here is the bad news|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or had a go at 6@C only failing on the awful break|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petergill: multilandy = 2@C for majors (Landy) and 2@D like a multi two opening, with 2M = 5+M and either 4+minor|pg||
nt|haans: or 4 cards in M + longer minor|pg||
nt|petergill: I make a good echo. :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)  at least the specs now know |pg||
nt|sybarra: btw Ilike it also |pg||
nt|petergill: This should go down, especially if declarer plays a spade to the king (likely, normal)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that hurt |pg||
nt|santyclz: That eases the guess somewhat.|pg||
nt|andyv:  everyone loves to finesse|pg||
nt|andyv:  strip and endplay would have worked here|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sharynr: they will warm up soon|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|don paulus: fell asleep ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all bad news for S now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: -2 I think|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I may be wrong but 2 @C with S would justify 2NT|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|sybarra: now can roll home |pg||
nt|sybarra: as long as declarer does try a early @D |pg||
nt|don paulus: complete misfit and "only" 31 pts|pg||
nt|don paulus: so 6 nt far away|pg||
nt|haans: wityh a good hearts = + at least 2 point to me|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: alternative give up 1 @S|pg||

nt|vugraphzus: north seems excited with his hand:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes could get too high in @D|pg||
nt|petergill: I think South should duck the first spade, that solves the problem, as declarer will surely play the king. |pg||
nt|haans: no but 3nt with 16 hcp after a jump?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: north pitched a club .so it makes +2|pg||
nt|iris100:  quite boring boards - another standard game|pg||
mb|1D|nt|haans: yes 0-0|pg||

mb|1H|nt|don paulus: no big swing this board|pg||
nt|garnetts: hard not to|pg||
nt|haans: here we may fi9nd why 3nt. they use Big Clubs|pg||
nt|haans: so 3@H was weaker that i belived|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They may think about slam on this one but need to identify the poor trumps|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|cherdano:  so would be a good safe, but only if you are sure 6@S is making|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: against 6 @S i meant|pg||
nt|cherdano:  yes|pg||
nt|cherdano:  3@H is probably a mixed raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: east is very aggresive player|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the web site is down again but here it is http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Istanbul.htm|pg||

nt|ybob: win 13 tricks|pg||
nt|rgdruru: 7@h i think|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nab could have saved there with the double @C@H fit thx Pieter for pointing that out|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: but not now after only 1@D --what do you need these days for 2@C opening|pg||
nt|chick: personally, I think it's too old to play as a junior, but I suppose there aren't enough 13-18 year olds to fill a tourney like this|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  i would just bid 2@H at red/white and with @SKxxx|pg||
nt|sybarra: do they play wk nt Peter? |pg||
nt|andyv:  smolen?|pg||
nt|tweety1: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: i think east REALLY likes to bid!|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yeah.very|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this is the under 26 tourney not the under 21|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: Bd 5: Luke Gardiner gave correct upside down count in @d's with @D7, and playing a heart back instead of a club was reasonable, so no need for a post mortem. |pg||
nt|garnetts: Good idea to upgrade here --even thogh it might not work out too well|pg||
nt|chick: is there an under-21 world tourney?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: adam is checking their convention card|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: correct bid as per Blue team in the 60th|pg||

nt|vugraphzus: no big decisions|pg||
nt|haans: soon @D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@S on the 4-3 was very well done other room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H 4@S NS-another flat I think|pg||
nt|haans: to slow to show spade void |pg||
nt|iris100:  But as even 5@S makes|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kiwibridge: OR did go via 1@S but still reached 4@H last one|pg||
nt|sybarra: same auction as other table |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or a failing 3N :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: takes the punt ouch|pg||
nt|petergill: 10-12 NT at this vul and position|pg||
nt|sybarra: thus the @D opening |pg||
nt|ybob: 4@S exclusion 5@H 2+Q|pg||
pc|dK|nt|garnetts: Not that bad a bid just that bad a result|pg||
nt|ybob: now 7@H|pg||
nt|haans: are you sure?|pg||
nt|ybob: 99 %|pg||
nt|andyv:  will be much tougher to dble here than in OR where W opened with 1@D|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ybob: can E bid 5@H if 4@S cue ????|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they are combined here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another flat board I think|pg||
nt|ybob: maybe regular KCA|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|cherdano:  declarer has to be a bit careful here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D lead difficult|pg||
nt|petergill: Good lead by Andy Hung, better than say @DK|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North realizes South has heart shortage so the hands fit badly|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kiwibridge: 4th highes from longest suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: often works|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kiwibridge: 6@D is confusing|pg||

nt|haans: all cards wrong for declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: except @HJ10|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rgdruru: Incredible since they stay in 6|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|sharynr: the Dutch women (Girls?) have taken the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: played 8 of spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: and now he is sad:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: have a lot of sympathy---the 6@D bid shows character and understanding |pg||
nt|garnetts: Should get the clubs right after this |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Strange defense Likely to end play himself|pg||
nt|santyclz: Quite.  Doesn't quite do it for declarer though.|pg||
nt|haans: they have to go back home and have a little talk|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 8 tricks only|pg||
nt|petergill: but the contract figures to fail, after this good lead and good defence, I think|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like -2 here also|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cherdano:  now EW can get a trump promotion|pg||
nt|cherdano:  with @SK and three rounds of diamond|pg||
nt|chick: yeah, that's what I figured... too bad :(|pg||

nt|andyv:  and 5 more imps for Egypt|pg||
nt|tweety1: EW finds the slam and becomes the new leader :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  a chance for E/W as slam seems reasonable|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so usa red have clawed back the deficit|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  yes locking declarer in dummy would have worked too to beat it legitimately|pg||
nt|haans: and N|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 43 imps in 7 boards|pg||
nt|garnetts: Very poor auction in the OR--East failing to bid 4@H |pg||
nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
mb|1C!|an|+2!c|nt|cherdano:  East should exit with a high club to do that!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: same contract only -3 OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  esp. when W made a slam try with 4@c bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: usually better to pass initially then act--initial action being a little weaker in good style|pg||
nt|andyv:  some players hate to pass:)|pg||
nt|chick: of course if the boards had been in reverse order, we'd say that NED clawed back their deficit :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|cherdano:  (in case declarer has @C6)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: exactly|pg||
nt|haans: also weak openings|pg||
nt|sharynr: and so is North apparently :)|pg||
nt|haans: what an overcall|pg||
nt|2celik1: in 6|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cze salim welcome|pg||
nt|rnmalik: corrected:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: There we go.  That's more like what we expect from jr's.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H NS and some play|pg||
nt|andyv:  they like to play machismo bridge:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharynr: better than most other bids she made|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: hard to predict pass pass board in this table|pg||
nt|2celik1: hi Gary thank you|pg||
nt|garnetts: No reason for South to even think|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well that is a certainly brave from North--well done|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice bid by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  West is tempted to double for takout?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he is thinking|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i would double too|pg||
nt|garnetts: even I might make this one|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well passed S guess hes seen pards weak 2's before:)|pg||
nt|petergill: Team 42 is a good team, from four different countries (Bulgaria from Eastern Europe, Belgium from Western Europe, South Africa and Australia), pehaps the most geographically ...|pg||
nt|petergill: diverse team ever in the history of bridge|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cherdano:  if he had doubled, EW could get to 4@H|pg||
nt|sharynr: very true, operator|pg||
nt|don paulus: diff with @c lead|pg||
nt|don paulus: 3 nt|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lots of excitement here :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: again NOT an opener, who teaches these kids?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|2celik1: so young so much|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this ones is cold|pg||
nt|haans: 15+ for big clubs|pg||
nt|tweety1: puff|pg||
nt|garnetts: which is why West does better to pass intially and then bid--you really do need a system after a multi|pg||
nt|andyv:  if W had his bid, I'd much prefer a dbl by E at this vul than 4@S bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  which would probably make|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he passed|pg||
nt|haans: first unusual bid|pg||
nt|don paulus: thought 8 pts was in the max range|pg||
nt|don paulus: what scared him off ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: and south is about to bid 3nt with good spots|pg||
nt|haans: clubs lead?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|cherdano:  North has an easy pass of 2@C|pg||
nt|haans: pass on 2@D are S serious|pg||
nt|haans: that is something to talk about|pg||
nt|don paulus: if not - switch will follow|pg||
nt|garnetts: Just as an aside--the recommended lead is the A@D |pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, it is tough on BBO when you are playing strong players and things don't go your way|pg||
nt|sybarra: werent you ever young Gary, and felt invicible?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzus: again 5-1 trumps|pg||
nt|sharynr: South is happy |pg||
nt|haans: no double = no so happy|pg||
nt|sharynr: i predict down 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: need @c T swtch to beat|pg||
nt|haans: clubs T?|pg||
nt|haans: all are going down|pg||
nt|chick: the juniors are fearless :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: let me think...yes I was young once but learnt sound priciples via Charles goren|pg||
nt|sybarra: hey, the wose that happens is you go down....|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  3NT should be defeated I think as the defence can set up clubs before declarer can establish a second diamond|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rnmalik: small a winner here|pg||
nt|sybarra: aha|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 3 better you are saying |pg||
nt|haans: its tough on BBS if you do not have the cards|pg||
nt|haans: BBO|pg||
nt|sybarra: (per a jr.)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 3 losers only|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: at least we have youth playing which is a great thing|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  so NS will score an easy +130|pg||
nt|iris100:  3@S should go down as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  where as double would have gotten EW to a making @H partial, or game|pg||
nt|cherdano:  it doesn't usually pay to let opponents play 2@C when you are 5-5 in the unbid suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: played k|pg||
nt|haans: not easy to find|pg||
nt|chick: actually, I don't mind the E opener, honors are top and texture is better than the previous hand we discussed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hey i'm getting great feedback kibitzers @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Cornelia |pg||
pc|cT|nt|haans: i assume 1H did show 5 spades|pg||
nt|don paulus: probably transfer|pg||
nt|ybob: 1NT ask how many controls ?|pg||
nt|haans: yes mb|pg||
nt|ybob: not alert ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: 2 h was transfer |pg||
nt|haans: ty|pg||
nt|garnetts: Surely not with three trumps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'll leap wildly with shape or support for pard|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|2celik1: and we are in Istanbul on of the excited city on the earth |pg||
nt|don paulus: - 2 ?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: or at least that is how I felt in the Spingold on BBO the other day being crushed (pleasantly, I have to admit) by Alan Sontag|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: this is real|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|haans: smal clubs = grave error|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|cherdano:  EW had no idea how distributional South is|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|nigel_k:  If South just passed a forcing bid she chose an excellent time to do so|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Cannot ruff both hands make it difficult for him|pg||
nt|andyv:  because of 3 trump... with 4, 4@S is automatic, with 3, 800 or 1100 are very real possibilities|pg||
nt|garnetts: WEst should not really have the mountain he has--and 200 or 500 are much more likely|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm afraid that 2Aces and an unsupported K is only 2 quick tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: means you can provide just 2 of the 7 tricks you are bidding for, part needs to provide 3 times as many as you|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: again director is called|pg||
nt|chick: but of course partner can also promote some of your other stuff to full tricks, too |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: east says ý thought adam has spade stoper|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ybob: .|pg||
nt|haans: from specs 1@H 8-11 any 2@H trf|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ybob: 3Nt was cold|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  As before, an extra trick can eventually be established in diamonds but not hearts|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i dont really blame them for giving up this trick|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|nigel_k:  Playing on hearts looks like it will limit declarer to eight tricks|pg||
nt|iris100:  itrue|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Also note the excellent choice of a trump as North was marked with short trumps and the ability to ruff clubs|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  For the opening lead|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: great experience for these youngsters, there are 3 Kiwis there|pg||
nt|iris100:  very nice opening lead|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|petergill: @HA might run away if not cashed now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|2celik1: we have second flat board in this match (hopefully)|pg||
nt|sybarra: why not spade?|pg||
mc|10|nt|sharynr: At this point NS should know only @D left in East hand|pg||
nt|2celik1: why not 4?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: OR has slowed doen|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I mentioned yesterday also that Pakistan team participating in this champioship and all the players below 18.|pg||

nt|cherdano:  but here North was so weak (no points in partner's suits) that he shouldn't mind playing 2@C|pg||
nt|haans: a double of 2@D would tell N = i have @D|pg||
nt|sharynr: agree|pg||
nt|sharynr: especially since the 1NT bid|pg||

nt|haans: slam here|pg||
nt|don paulus: 7 @h or nt even|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C-3@D easy |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: our 4th player is from Ecuador|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: by?|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is because a blind lead often gives away a crucial trick--so cash and ace to get a look|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: fair enough|pg||
nt|petergill: Flat board - in my opinion, a little overtrick ns not a big deal at imps|pg||
nt|petergill: Team 42 want 11 more imps to reach the magical 42 imp mark|pg||
nt|iris100:  another flat board|pg||

nt|vugraphzus: france guys think 2down|pg||
nt|iris100:  1 SA by S in the open room|pg||
nt|sybarra: something truly didnt make sense there |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 75% of the time, all those openers do is tell declarer how to finesse|pg||
mb|1C|nt|2celik1: i see |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but only at imps|pg||
nt|sybarra: 42 imp= blitz |pg||
nt|andyv:  take away the K@c and 800 is still there|pg||
mb|1S|nt|haans: or else much harder|pg||
nt|garnetts: more so at pairs I think|pg||
mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: not sure how that happened :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzus: i guess she was expecting spades in N 's hand.but they all are ok now|pg||
nt|sybarra: true|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|sybarra: Andy finding the spades and minor bid "amuzing" |pg||

nt|haans: having 14 hcp 3 have already bid?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sharynr: 1 think I admire about young players is there very quick decisions|pg||
nt|haans: you came to a GRAND|pg||
nt|don paulus: we saved a grand for you :)|pg||
nt|haans: good opps bidding|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is a lot of spades to bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: Also some practiced pairs reverse their normal lead structure against pre-empts--K from AK and the lead of an ace requires an attitude signal|pg||
nt|sybarra: does he X?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he is thinking|pg||
nt|petergill: in Adams' 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - answer to the ultimate question about the meaning of life = 42, for those even more illiterate than me |pg||
nt|haans: does W let is stand|pg||
nt|andyv:  and you are right...either pass, or dbl and then bid @s would have been better action by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzus: and passed|pg||
nt|iris100:  same bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @H forcing?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure he wants to give the hand away |pg||
nt|petergill: Operator, are you sure that East di not dbl?|pg||
nt|tweety1: very unlucky slam miss other room again..|pg||
mb|3H|nt|cherdano:  declarer will probably take this trick, cross to a diamond, and take a spade finesse|pg||
nt|garnetts: This argument is a little futile--I will always support when I can rather than double in this situation--and with a small manipulation there is a grand for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: or "bettering" the contract, same level |pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Discussion hand.  In your partnership does the 2@h bid imply @d support or tend to show @d shortage?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I wouldnt  with E east hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes|pg||
nt|haans: if he pass W cannot bid anymore|pg||
nt|chick: 2@C will be limit raise |pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: keeps ops out of 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: i think east should ask rkcb with 4nt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure that 4S did anything to keep them out of 7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: man overboard here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Is west getting desperate ?  4@H ?  |pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Basar|pg||
nt|haans: call it tactical|pg||
nt|ybob: 1NT 2@C 2@H 4@H ?|pg||
nt|chick: which S declines to bid, given his hand full of garbage :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sharynr: another overbid|pg||
nt|haans: but are not W to fault pass on 1@C makeable|pg||
nt|sharynr: was 1@C not forcing?|pg||
nt|haans: maybe all bid are forcing|pg||
nt|sharynr: seems both bids alerted|pg||
nt|haans: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: west always puts cards over board when he is dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: indeed discussion |pg||
nt|haans: are opener bidding all forcing bids|pg||
nt|garnetts: But as you say I am sure we would have managed a little better in practice|pg||
nt|garnetts: Interesting choice 2@S--anyone for what I think is an obvious 2@D |pg||
pc|d2|nt|tweety1: needs to know what this 2 @c alert means..|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: probably could be short|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: they didnt wrote note|pg||
nt|garnetts: To some extent yes--but given limited possibilities 2@D seems to be space saving|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: @HJ - that's good news and bad news, thinks South - the good news is that I'm not doubled|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|cherdano:  giving him 8 tricks|pg||
nt|sharynr: is west the only male at the table?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes:)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|don paulus: 3 nt makes with @d lead :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: write|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  perhaps N was trying to show value of his hand with 2@s bid|pg||
pc|dK|nt|iris100:  looks like 3@S, 1@D, 2@H and 1@C = just made|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Winning the spade doesn't help as dummy has no entry|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Declarer now has to guess spades though East's opening bid will help|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: excellent J@C|pg||
nt|garnetts: Great card by South|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H first natural bid by opener|pg||
nt|haans: even Big Clubs are changing|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|tweety1: then 2 @s is not that strong|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|haans: will not like were clubs honor are|pg||
nt|sharynr: she pretty much needs the @CA onside to make, and @D 3-3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rnmalik: The system they are playing. If 2@D natural then 2@H natural too|pg||
nt|sybarra: since not match points,  why bother with jxx of @D |pg||
nt|garnetts: Well he hasn't got reversing vales with a void in what is liekly to be partner's suit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: Did you meet Masood Salim, his Partner. Walking computer|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we've lost some comparisons in that break|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|sybarra: what a finesse |pg||

pc|s9|nt|vugraphzus: west seems upset after looking at dummy|pg||

nt|andyv:  but, can't really comment without knowing what 2@cs was all about.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|don paulus: do not like singelton trump lead - but other leads may give a trick away|pg||
nt|andyv:  otherwise, 2@d seems like the normal bid|pg||

mb|p!|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well thye double good enuf against making game but not slam,|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: W has no choice with 2 @H losers|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Well N's undisciplined 5@H really has to guarantee the @H A so slam should be odds on|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think E should have bid it|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|6N|nt|lestergold: well done they got there!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzut: 6nt was very fast|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzut: i mean automatically|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear wants to 'protect the heart K an understandable toughyt but a poor decision to make against the strong hand opposite who said he wanted to play in spades|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: yep found the killer |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|lestergold: the natural lead i would say|pg||
pc|c4|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|h6|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|h9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|lestergold: again inmexperience there was no need to 'protect' the ht K it was a working king ther ewas a need to consider the danger of an attack in another suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzut: claimed -1 |pg||
nt|lestergold: tragic|pg||

qx|c19|st||md|1S95HQ82DKQT42CT97,SAKQ8762H96DJ73CA,STHAJT543D95CJ642,SJ43HK7DA86CKQ853|sv|e|nt|haans: you cannot fist show controls then ask Blackwwod|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: after 4nt he can ask extras with 5nt .and he will get @d K for grand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then W should bid 5N as a grand slam try over 5H. not practical to play it specifically as Josephine by 2C opener|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we are playing 10 boards here.|pg||
nt|petergill: so this is a good board for New Zealand (NS)|pg||
nt|haans: natural to bid 4@H going down|pg||
nt|iris100:  next board looks more interesting|pg||
nt|iris100:  4@H by W has some chances|pg||
nt|iris100:  nasty lead for N|pg||
nt|tweety1: then the only reason seems the quality of @s   to be bid.|pg||
nt|tweety1: instead of @d|pg||
nt|garnetts: Odd method--also some case for South responding with 1@S |pg||
nt|andyv:  ty... makes more sense now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good effort both rooms|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzus: and threw it|pg||
nt|sharynr: :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Really, e ducked the @s?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: A great opportunity for the girls to take the lead|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cherdano:  EW should get to 4@H here|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt it |pg||
nt|rnmalik: CR @S lead and no@D finesse 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: @C lead |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6@S looks a go|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk5: In the other room East wanted to protect his @HK and pulled 6@S to 6NT. That was not a good idea|pg||
nt|Walddk5: @DK put an end to that contract|pg||
mb|4C|nt|petergill: so the score soon will be 31-12 or 31-8 I think|pg||
nt|garnetts: Looks like a push here in 4@H plus one |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 3@C best bid|pg||
nt|sharynr: agree|pg||
nt|haans: do not understand what 4@S mean?|pg||
nt|petergill: Anticipating 4@H by EW, Norh takes the advance save with a keen eye on the vulnerability|pg||
nt|don paulus: surprising result on board 16 : 6 @s X !|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, N bid 5@d here|pg||
nt|chick: it was still a good thing to consider, even though it didn't work out this time|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sharynr: should not expect a @S fit |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks Basar, hard for you when we lose connection|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no swings here then|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: its ok |pg||
nt|rnmalik: short and sweet-no trouble for us.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Operator, please check the result on bd 28.  It looked to be -1.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes pl|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt coming up some how |pg||
nt|haans: in teori thay have 3nt EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: you can play 5nt as Q ask|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we appreciate your efforts :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: u welcome:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: does W sit?|pg||
nt|haans: do you agree with that peter?|pg||
nt|petergill: His mother makes the same sorts of pressure bids when she plays with me - putting max pressure on EW early in the bidding, giving EW the last guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am not sure W can sit |pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H is cold for 620|pg||
nt|haans: go back on hand. DID YOU p X THEN?|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Not that it makes much of an imp difference.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S looks likt transfer to clubs |pg||
nt|petergill: West might take the Dbl as values instead of pure penalty|pg||
nt|petergill: as he has done!|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 2@C = any game force?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good old gazillie|pg||
nt|don paulus: - 6 = 1400 wins an imp :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|cherdano:  and meanwhile 5 IMPS to Italy, as North found a more successful @H lead at the other table|pg||
nt|haans: can anyone tell all scores|pg||
nt|iris100:  1@H, 3@C and a spade, thats it for N|pg||
nt|andyv:  less pressure at 4@h on declarer|pg||
nt|garnetts: They were pushed to 5@H next door|pg||
pc|dA|nt|haans: she did not jump|pg||
nt|sharynr: Once again, a touch too high|pg||
nt|petergill: A good coup by Luke Gardiner, making EW guess, and they have now guessed wrongly|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: but no jumping from E :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: too bad, 3nt would have been better|pg||
nt|don paulus: good action by S|pg||
nt|haans: all i can say is HOLY ...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Still, -200 is better than -620|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe. 2H going down. in my view it is better and safer to act initially on the S hand|pg||
nt|haans: me 2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: even in this sequence-looking for @S check I think|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 13 imps|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kiwibridge: looks like Noname have a decent win here barring a disaster on 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: S not wanting N to bid again!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzus: passed 3nt |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: strange|pg||
nt|sybarra: that lead doesnt hurt |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: this is quite fun table|pg||
nt|garnetts: will cash AK @H then clubs for 11 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cherdano:  2N 18-19 balalnced, 3@D transfer, 3@S superaccept i assume|pg||
nt|garnetts: slam needs both major suits to break 3-2 with an extra residual chance in spades and the club ace right or led |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: and some more greek speech |pg||
nt|sybarra: that could be right also |pg||
nt|iris100:  but you wont make 4!E from E|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|andyv:  cash K@h, clear clubs and exit @h|pg||
nt|garnetts: mmaybe not with the unblock|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cherdano:  after @CAK and seeing the heart break, declarer can endplay South|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: seems that way.i couldnt read notes|pg||
nt|iris100:  4@H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cherdano:  so he won't need the @D finesse|pg||
nt|sharynr: yes, kib suggests a trump back to let declarer do all the owrk|pg||
pc|s4|nt|iris100:  as N doesnt follow 3 rounds of @D|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: The vulnerability was vital to North's decision to bounce the auction. He knew EW have 8+ @H's if South has only 4 spades. |pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharynr: work*|pg||
nt|don paulus: would you then prefer 2 @c over dbl ? with only 3 @s ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably not going to mess around much here |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|don paulus: very close match apart from board 11|pg||
nt|don paulus: sry 12|pg||
pc|s2|nt|nigel_k:  Yes, slightly lucky escape for E/W then|pg||
pc|h4|pc|sJ|nt|nigel_k:  Possibly their defence to 1NT left West with no option other than pass|pg||
nt|chick: yep, a big swing back for NED, although some kibs saying it is a gift, not earned|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|petergill: Good comeback by New Zealand - they got 800 (the max) for 12 imps on the last board|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d7|nt|haans: yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i prefer double, since S lacks club ten|pg||
nt|haans: x of 2@H usually mean no spades|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|nigel_k:  Unfortunately the web site is down and we can't see their convention card|pg||
nt|andyv:  simple game sometimes:)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|dJ|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|s7|nt|petergill: since with 4/4 in majors South would respond 1@H|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|iris100:  the web site is down most of the time unfortunately|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|sybarra: hmmm more action at this table!|pg||
pc|h7|nt|haans: an original match|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S hand will play all right in 43 spade fit, at partscore level. |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|haans: from wbf002: usa blue 169ö neth gýrls 146ö neth red 142ö japan-czech 142|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Many pairs now play double as artificial. If West's only alternative was 2NT for minors, pass is more understandable|pg||
mc|12|nt|cherdano:  10 tricks only|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 26 imp board as 13 the other way if content with 6@S|pg||

nt|petergill: Credit that 9 imp gain to Luke Gardiner's daring but sensible tactical bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: thx all last board now.i hope you are enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The defence dropped a trick so 3 imps to N/S|pg||
nt|tweety1: maybe some imps exchanges here:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think the auction next door was dreadful|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to imagine how E/W got to that lovely contract in the OR|pg||
nt|tweety1: Many people opens 1 @c instead of @d with W's hand nowadays... and the only disadvantage is...|pg||
nt|andyv:  even so, I'd pass 1H like a shot with the E hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: Their method needs looking at--personally I do mind the 1@C on a doubleton--but dislike the 1@h rebid--but if you must then also must bid 2@D after 2@C |pg||
nt|tweety1: agree  1nt seems better than 1 h|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, W opened 1@c, which was alerted as 2+... and E showed a preference for @cs|pg||
nt|chick: not totally sure I agree ... E in the other room made a decision to protect his @HK and got unlucky|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is last bd of this set |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: laura is saying " maybe i should bid 5 spades"|pg||

mb|p|nt|cherdano:  NS can make grand slam|pg||
nt|cherdano:  in several strains|pg||
nt|cherdano:  but 6@C is the best contract|pg||
nt|sharynr: A multi opening|pg||
nt|garnetts: well after this |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I guess it's lunch time Basar?|pg||
nt|haans: ty :))|pg||
nt|rgdruru: and 6@s|pg||
nt|don paulus: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Information.htm|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well W had already said in the other room that he wanted to play 6S, ie E had no reason to think the heart king needed protection|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Basar as always....great job! |pg||
nt|chick: but it closes the IMP gap, keeping this session exciting :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry, meant as private|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as N had JUMPED to 2@H, there was a fair chance the !A was there, ergo 6NT was an awful bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty also Cornelia and Gary, for your thoughts and insights on these hands |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: last board now.thx all.i hope you enjoyed the show.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzus: last bord was just made.fixed it now|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes its:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  is 3S general strength, or does it show clubs?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: welcome back:)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well Japan_Czech will enjoy theirs :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: yuck --not a great spot |pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to the WBF for organizing and bringing this to bbo   we LOVE seening the jrs. ! |pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, thanks Basar and thanks to the organisers in Istanbul such as Murat Molva and Ata Aydin.  |pg||
mb|2H|nt|cherdano:  slam will be difficult to find now|pg||
nt|garnetts: but curiously the spades mean it will play OK|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: i agree |pg||
nt|rnmalik: action board again|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: not available|pg||
nt|iris100:  possible 3SA on the last one|pg||
nt|iris100:  but i think it goes down on a @S lead and @C switch on the third trick|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sharynr: zig and zag|pg||
nt|santyclz: Awfully heavy for a weak jump, maybe intermediate?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx specs for your informative and funny comments, we love them |pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: re-hi|pg||
nt|haans: hi|pg||
nt|petergill: A low heart lead????|pg||
nt|haans: lead low @H = make|pg||
nt|petergill: More daring bidding by NS gives Andy Hung a lead problem|pg||
nt|haans: u first|pg||
nt|petergill: the textbooks say 4th best from this holding|pg||
mb|4H|nt|don paulus: surprising result board 27 !|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: first blood of this match|pg||
nt|don paulus: y|pg||
nt|sybarra: might even have trouble making 4 |pg||
nt|rnmalik: that should be the contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: ak of clubs, ruff, and ace of hts |pg||
nt|rnmalik: less damage|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  A nasty guess in diamonds awaits declarer as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: this is last board of the round thx everyone|pg||
nt|iris100:  but then, you just give up a @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  meanwhile, 3@S would have been down 5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a fun match, next round starts in 45 minutes, thanks Basar great operating and thanks Rashed and Salim|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|petergill: Luke Gardiner did well to make himself declarer - now can he get the clubs right?|pg||
nt|haans: 10-12 nt win lots because opps not know what to bid|pg||
nt|rgdruru: i guess 6 @D i pretty hard to reach, especially after nt opening|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks kibs, best session so far for feedback|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rgdruru: not that it should be bid|pg||
nt|haans: nore logical that NT-bidder have @DK|pg||
nt|haans: as logical as @CA|pg||
nt|rgdruru: even so, both 3nt and 6 @D are down if k @D on W|pg||
nt|haans: yep so better slam has been missed|pg||
nt|ybob: S made that opening works|pg||
pc|d5|nt|haans: game|pg||

nt|sybarra: wd |pg||
nt|haans: not better that max 50%|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|santyclz: The open room reached 5@c on bd 29 on what looks very much like a bidding misunderstanding.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: yes a good win, have fun later I see you are on with Shirley she is good fun|pg||
nt|haans: time to claim|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cherdano:  and maybe double by North would have actually been the best bid|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, 1-1 clubs was indicated by EW's silence in the bidding - with a club void, West might have bid over 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: this is the last board of the match.thx all see you tomorrow|pg||
