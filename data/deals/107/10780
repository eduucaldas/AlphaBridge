mb|3S|nt|gulyas: E is one of the several good Drijver brothers:) Bob I think|pg||
nt|gulyas: OK, confirmed, its Bob|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@C either a multi of some sort, or a major 2 suiter (but my guess is, its a multi variation)|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@S was pass or correct|pg||
nt|chick: which means W may need to decide if 3@S could be a real suit|pg||
nt|gulyas: the double was just showing a good hand I would think, and I have no clue what 3@S would want to mean:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: OK, I am told that 2@C was in fact BOTH majors|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||

nt|april7: 6@C though is a good save by EW|pg||

nt|gulyas: he does have a 6card support and a void after all:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: so then obv 3@S was SHOWING stop, since the opps have 2 suits|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cherdano:  North is 5-5 but has bad suits and the wrong shape to act over 2@H in the passout seat|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|gulyas: so currently, Italy Red are 5th, Australia 9th, both fighting for qualification|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|april7: rather 6@D than X i would suggest|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|april7: but one should not be to greedy|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|gulyas: it looks like NS loses at least 1 trick in each suit|pg||

pc|d3|pc|s5|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||

nt|chick: well, E did double and then cuebid even with W's pass|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|gulyas: forcing dummy is a good idea, that way they cannot use the side suit in @Hs|pg||

nt|chick: this is going to be a big swing to start the round ... wonder how it will affect morale for the rest|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gulyas: he will just play them normally, it is not likely that W plays @Cs that way if he had 5 of them|pg||

pc|c4|nt|athene: perhaps with the nebulous club it wasn't so clear that X of 1NT was t/o of @C|pg||
nt|othered1: What's your defense in south's position after a 1@C opening that didn't guarantee @Clength?|pg||

pc|c2|pc|s7|pg||

pc|h3|pc|c8|pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||

mb|p|nt|gulyas: but if the @Ss ran, he had 9 tricks from top|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Macura|pg||

nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: snap :)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cherdano:  and 2NT artificial?|pg||
nt|nulda: North player - Michal Kopecky - had a bid success at San Remo a month ago|pg||
nt|nulda: 5th place in Open Pairs category|pg||
nt|cherdano:  that is a nice result indeed|pg||
nt|nulda: 2NT relay|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that 1@C opening is not so much skinny as anorexic |pg||
nt|mdgraham: as Daniel said,,passing 5@Cx with a void and six card trump support just looked wrong|pg||
nt|april7: 9 or 10 tricks, depending on the play|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|gulyas: weird|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@C as we have seen is both majors, x probably showing a wk NT worth hand, or any strong hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: since this time its 13 balanced, she passed the forward-going 3@C|pg||
nt|gulyas: this looks like 4 tricks off the top, but with the @H ruff also coming, it will probably go down|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|nulda: 3s minimum |pg||
nt|gulyas: with trumps not behaving, 2@S is the limit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but you can't imagine South passing now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5 imps, as 6@Cx-2 in the Open Room|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|cherdano:  and South has second thoughts about inviting?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: o\_/ hand|pg||
nt|chick: excellent duck|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lovely.  Tough play.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|cherdano:  on a diamond lead South will set up clubs and a club ruff for an easy +650|pg||
nt|nulda: just two aces to give|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: Nab is calling TD after 4@s|pg||
nt|cherdano:  oh - if north bid a slow 3@S then there may be a problem|pg||
nt|nulda: I dont think, there should be a problem|pg||

nt|Walddk2: tomorrow|pg||
nt|nulda: 4@s normal bid after 2s of N|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, if N's bidding suggested an 11-13 range, I would|pg||
nt|gulyas: duck is a good move, now he just needs to have his entries to take all the finesses he needs|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cherdano:  yes but why did South bid 2N?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|gulyas: I guess it didn't:)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|nulda: probably slam trying :)|pg||
nt|chick: but it also cuts off communication for the heart ruff|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gulyas: good save there|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|cherdano:  that would be a little aggressive :) |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it always seems to happen - you open light and pard piles you into game|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, that will help with avoiding the ruff|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cherdano:  especially if the overcall showed 12+|pg||
nt|nulda: as far as I know Milan Macura, he tryies for a slam on every opportunity|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i see|pg||
nt|cherdano:  here a duck by East would have given declarer a small problem to think about|pg||
nt|cherdano:  whether to take the @S finesse at all|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello Joe|pg||
nt|mdgraham: of course, that may not be a light opening for NS. They may have an agreement that they open such hands |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hey Joe|pg||
nt|april7: a play to J of @H would have been a better idea than finesse in @C , this finesse had time to be done|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Dan, Mike.|pg||
nt|gulyas: since N chose @Ss, @Hs was likely to be 5-2|pg||

nt|athene: you have zero defence after the 2@D raise|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|d|nt|andyv:  looking for 3N|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@c by N would be useful here |pg||
nt|athene: 3@S a sort of two-way shot perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: trying to talk opps out of the cold 4@S you are sure they have|pg||
nt|athene: by representing a better hand than you have|pg||
nt|athene: with the chance of making a miracle 3nt perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: although really that's pretty unlikely|pg||
mb|5D|mb|5S|nt|andyv:  you have 7 tricks...don't need much from pd to make 3N..he just doesn't have it here|pg||
nt|andyv:  again E/W are too high|pg||
nt|athene: north could have bid 5@C for the lead |pg||
mb|p!|nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|andyv:  and should have....no cost play|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|athene: hmm|pg||
nt|athene: well south's action here is surely illogical|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't know why pass of 5@s was alerted|pg||
nt|othered1: could the state of the event be influencing south, who knows they qualify for the quarterfinals unless they get slaughtered?|pg||
nt|ronpa: ty my friend. maybe we can arrange sometime a practice match with u guys?|pg||
nt|athene: well, risking 500 in a phantom 6@D is hardly a safe action|pg||
nt|athene: 500 if you are lucky :)|pg||
nt|athene: could be more|pg||
nt|athene: apparently north alerted the pass of 5@S as forcing|pg||
nt|andyv:  a spec says dbl of 5@s meant S wanted to bid on and pass says enough for me|pg||
nt|andyv:  i'm not sure why S wanted to bid on|pg||
nt|othered1: Do NS play a strong @C or the like?  If not, south's auction could be on a hand quite a bit stronger.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: it's so common to see misunderstandings over whether you are in a forcing pass situation|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is, people have rules like "forcing pass when it's obvious opps are saccing"|pg||
mb|p|mb|r|nt|athene: i have seen precisely that written on a hundred convention cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and it's a recipe for disaster|pg||
nt|othered1: you open the bidding, then you make a space-c0onsuming cue-bid, then you pass at the 5-level.  Seems forcing to me.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it's NEVER "obvious" who is saccing|pg||
nt|andyv:  if pass says I don't want to bid on, that S should respect N's dbl...or am I missing something?|pg||
nt|athene: you need absolutely cast-iron rules|pg||
nt|othered1: North, who was thinking of bidding 7, it looked like, thinks he has extras.|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, N just made this very expensive|pg||
nt|athene: well, clearly, south has made a grand slam try|pg||
nt|ronpa: I'll be there unless we will go to the nationals. are u coming with more hungary pairs?|pg||
nt|athene: he passed 5@S asking for a double, then bid 6@D|pg||
nt|othered1: could they have run afoul of the idea that pass and pull shows a maximum hand?|pg||
nt|athene: this is a clear grand slam try whether you play inverted doubles or not|pg||
nt|athene: north probably thinks his partner is ONLY missing a club control|pg||
nt|athene: because if he wanted to make a grand slam try WITH club control|pg||
nt|othered1: meanwhile, west is still live here|pg||
nt|andyv:  pass and pull has to be some type of grand slam invite...looks like S dug his own grave on this one.|pg||
nt|athene: he passes then bids 6@C over the double|pg||
nt|athene: so north was probably tempted to bid 7! but the weakness of his hand other than the @CAK decided against it|pg||
nt|athene: but he is happy to redouble|pg||
nt|andyv:  meanwhile W, who has little to do is thinking way too long for his pd's liking|pg||
nt|athene: he expects south to have something like the hand he has but with @HA and a spade void|pg||
nt|othered1: west didn't exactly show KQxx with his double of 3@S and parner did bid 5, so . . . |pg||
nt|andyv:  this is where the aging process begins for the youths:)|pg||
nt|athene: some people have rules for forcing pass like "if we bid game on a 'strong' auction"|pg||
nt|athene: so if you just bid something like 1@H - 4@H, that doesn't set up a forcing pass|pg||
nt|athene: but 1@H - 2NT; 4@H does|pg||
nt|athene: that's all very well|pg||
nt|othered1: before the redouble, this would have cost NS only 5 imps.  Not it's going to be a larger proposition one way or the other|pg||
nt|athene: but there are still grey areas|pg||
nt|athene: here, the question is whether south's 3@S shows a good hand |pg||
nt|athene: by far the best way to play is to have the blanket rule "pass isn't forcing!"|pg||
nt|vugraphzuq: West still thinking|pg||
nt|athene: and then agree the specific conditions under which it IS forcing|pg||
nt|andyv:  W really doesn't have much to think about.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  E can finally relax|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|othered1: The cue-bid then pass really feels like @S void to north.|pg||

pc|d4|nt|athene: yes south had shown something like this in the auction:- @S- @HAxx @DAKQxxxx @CJxx|pg||
mc|9|nt|othered1: That's that I'd think.|pg||

qx|c3|st||md|1S8H942DAKQT764CQ9,SKQ32HJ765DJ3C854,ST5HT83D9852CAKT6,SAJ9764HAKQDCJ732|sv|e|nt|cherdano:  but as West had showed up with @CA and (likely) @DK, declarer was assuming the @S finesse must be on|pg||
nt|cherdano:  btw, the swing on board 1 was caused by East's action over 1@S - he overcalled 1NT in the other room|pg||
nt|chick: lots of good inferences to make ... well done!|pg||
nt|santyclz: This looks like fun.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cherdano:  which looks very reasonable to me|pg||
nt|nulda: they play 1@h 14-20 5+|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: we always have some wood in stock:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: EW can make 4@S|pg||
nt|chick: now there's one convention I really dislike|pg||
nt|gulyas: NS can save in 5@D, going for 300|pg||
nt|santyclz: 5@d?|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|nt|santyclz: Best kind of sac.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H presumably hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so 4NT for the minor|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@S just makes|pg||
nt|gulyas: and so does 5@C:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it looks as if it takes a diamond lead to beat 6@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  so maybe North is tempted to bid more than 3@H here?|pg||
nt|gulyas: these teams are currently 8th and 6th, respectively, so they are both in the heat of qualifying (top8 Qs)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 5@D would be sensible, it is almost certain that EW has a Vul game, and this will go for 300 max|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|gulyas: I guess NS should sacrifice, all the way to 6@S:)|pg||
nt|april7: another 3NT but a litle more tricky|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gulyas: N, with no defense whatsoever outside @Ss could go to 5@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will lead a club, surely....and be somewhat narked by the outcome|pg||
nt|april7: now its easier again for N|pg||
nt|gulyas: now he has 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h7|nt|nulda: in CR 4spades made from EW|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|april7: I think N has still to find J of @S|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gulyas: 3@C,3@D,2@H,1@S should be enough:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|april7: he can finesse J of @C|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm conflicted about that, n having limited his hand with 1nt should usually leave such descisions to his pd, but this may be an exception.|pg||
nt|gulyas: E will take his 4 tops, thank you very much, and folds up soon after|pg||
nt|chick: must cash all tricks right now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|april7: E might develop10th trick by playing @S|pg||
nt|april7: but E will probably lead @D now|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|cherdano:  maybe North could have raised to 3@H right away|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @DJ looked a bit safer|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|nulda: W a bit two strong for 2s I suppose, 1s would be better|pg||
nt|cherdano:  to allow partner to bid 4 with extras|pg||
nt|santyclz: Unlucky might very well get out for -1 if played by s.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|cherdano:  yes the heavy jump caused EW to miss game here|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|gulyas: yes, thats what I meant|pg||
pc|c4|mc|9|nt|gulyas: so Bob knew he could not open up a trick in @Cs|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  would he have bid 3@s with that?  I think he definitely has a @s on the auction..and the A@h...N relied on clubs for the 12 trick|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|april7: a @H partscore for EW,2@H and 3@D for NS|pg||

nt|nulda: do not give an invitation to Macura, I know|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cherdano:  I kind of like 2NT|pg||
nt|cherdano:  with all those queens|pg||
nt|cherdano:  NT may well play better than hearts|pg||
nt|oliverc: well this contract will get everything it deserves|pg||
nt|gulyas: lead a trump and watch it fall apart|pg||
nt|april7: @H lead is best and E will go 2 down|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: probably making - can engineer a club ruff in the West hand|pg||
nt|april7: then only 1 down, but canot make it|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|gulyas: really bad hand W has|pg||
nt|mdgraham: trump lead often best on these types of auction |pg||
nt|gulyas: as long as he doesn't put up the @CJ but ruffs out the Q, he can get home in 2@H (no trump lead)|pg||
nt|april7: but he is in 3@H|pg||
nt|gulyas: that will not make|pg||
nt|gulyas: the only excitement would have come from playing in 4@S, but that would have made as well|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h6|nt|gulyas: don't see why he should bid 1@D|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|gulyas: he should have let the opps venture into 3-4@S and go down|pg||
nt|santyclz: It wouldn't have occurred to me.  1@s would have, but I would have resisted.|pg||
nt|gulyas: other room, a huge result for Australia|pg||
nt|gulyas: especially since 3@D is not making|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lead can't be right, that's what I would have led.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: not the best of starts for the defence|pg||
nt|april7: but without a X its 2 imps save|pg||

pc|sT|pc|hT|pc|h8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would have led a @H, but that still would not have helped:)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|santyclz: I'm of the old school that if an overcall doesn't take away any space it should be on full values.  The more space it takes away the less solid it has to be.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suspect that the double of 3@D was intended as take-out |pg||
pc|cA|nt|nulda: two down probably and 6 IMPs back to the Netherlands|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h3|pc|cJ|nt|cherdano:  although given the NS agreements, i dont think it is so attractive - opposite 15-17 balanced you will get to game anyway, and opposite an unbalanced hand diamonds or hearts may still play better|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gulyas: probably|pg||

nt|oliverc: I can't see any reason NOT to bid 1@H over 1@D|pg||
nt|oliverc: and I can't see ANY reason to bid 3NT over 2NT :)|pg||
nt|nulda: as I said, do not give an invitation do Milan Macura, you can bid a game itself instead|pg||
nt|cherdano:  yes the south hand looked good UNTIL partner suggested NT|pg||
nt|cherdano:  as long as East keeps his club here he is fine|pg||

nt|april7: only 1|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would ruff out @Ds and make 5@C|pg||
nt|gulyas: they went to 6@D, which would not have been too bad, but then REDOUBLED!|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  2@H probably shows 6 spades|pg||
nt|nulda: 1c 18-20 bal or 11+nat or 21+ anything|pg||
nt|oliverc: Well if EW are defending that poorly, South's decision to raise to game fully|pg||
nt|oliverc: justified, I suppose|pg||

mb|2C|nt|cherdano:  NS in the other room got pushed to 5@S|pg||

nt|mdgraham: @DA, @D ruff, @HA, @D ruff|pg||

mb|p|nt|oliverc: ...and will probably make 11 tricks, too, just to rub salt in the wounds|pg||
nt|nulda: 5s from N hand should be make|pg||

mb|p|nt|april7: 1@S -1NT 2@H  2@S 3@H???|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: against a possibly short club, it is debatable was the 2@C cue is - it can be played as natural. |pg||
mb|2H!|nt|april7: but S passed already, so no 3@H anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|nulda: in GF now|pg||
nt|oliverc: If NS bid to 3NT on  4, expect them to get to 6@S here :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, you need to have SOME sort of a forcing bid|pg||
nt|santyclz: Agree with 2@c, but should then backpedal.|pg||
nt|april7: but S would have made 3 @H|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: However having a general cue-bid available is a good idea, so even against short clubs 2@C is useful as a cue  |pg||
mb|4S|nt|nulda: splinter bid|pg||
nt|nulda: cue-bid|pg||
nt|cherdano:  the 4@C cuebid should make south put on the brakes|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: no sign of that LOL|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: so, no matter how short 1@C can be, 2@C should always be a cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  if he can read it as shortness|pg||
nt|ritong: for our possibly unaware specs, "carryover" is a part of the acquired score in qualifications when you play the same team again|pg||

nt|chick: a big swing for SKAWINA if they make this|pg||
pc|h6|nt|gulyas: this a good example of not having the same wavelength abt the values in overcall|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cherdano:  but now he will find out about the missing keycard and queen|pg||
nt|gulyas: if its OK to overcall with the S hand, N should not bid more than 2@C followed by 2@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: Agree 100%, Daniel.|pg||
nt|gulyas: now he is going down a lot|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. homework failure|pg||

nt|chick: and they should|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|nulda: 2 out of 5 without the Q, even S found the brake pedal|pg||
nt|cherdano:  but maybe it is rather North who bid too much here|pg||
nt|cherdano:  he is minimum in their style, has a void in partner's suit|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|cherdano:  and made two cuebids after a reverse|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=9  for standings after 9 rounds. First 8 after 13 rounds advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: tomorrow|pg||
nt|cherdano:  this is a bit of speculation of course as we don't know their exact agreement|pg||
nt|nulda: so 3 more RR matches in the afternoon|pg||
nt|gulyas: since N could be any strong hand, all S showed was his pattern, not his overall strength|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cherdano:  5@S is already uncomfortably high|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is, but cards are very friendly|pg||
nt|cherdano:  how would you play it though? any 4-1 trump break is dangerous|pg||
nt|oliverc: You're asking the wrong person  -  Roland would be in 7 here LOL|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Win the club, cash two top spades ending in hand. If no queen, work with hearts. If West has four trumps I am still ok. Can't do anything if East has Q10xx anyway|pg||
nt|oliverc: sounds right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unblock @HQ first of course|pg||
nt|cherdano:  you still run into problems with spades 4-1 onside i think roland|pg||
nt|cherdano:  say you ruff a heart,how you dont have an entry back to hand|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i think you should play @DK earlier|pg||
nt|cherdano:  to set up a diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't I lead a spade up later? Requires that West has four hearts along with four trumps|pg||
nt|april7: N gets an uppercut in @S now|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|santyclz: Every journey...|pg||

pc|sK|nt|april7: tricky now,@S King and @C J discrding the @H loser|pg||
nt|april7: or overruffing and discarding later|pg||

pc|d2|pc|c2|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|santyclz: Of course, the q is the normal play, I'm not disputing that, it's just unfortunate.|pg||

nt|athene: so 3@H asking for a stop|pg||
nt|athene: when 3@S denies one, north says "ok, 4@C"|pg||
nt|andyv:  meantime, this hand looks like a lead problem |pg||

nt|athene: but one piece of luck - 4@S indeed went down|pg||
nt|vugraphzuq: Last bord coming for rubin round|pg||
nt|athene: when NS played the misunderstanding 4@C|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|athene: heart lead to the @HK, and declarer made the mistake of ducking|pg||
nt|athene: now Marion switched to the unerring diamond and that was that|pg||
nt|andyv:  two disaster sequences and N/S still alive.  They should be in Las Vegas |pg||
nt|athene: Michielsen-Drijver have really not put a foot wrong this set|pg||
nt|athene: that's why :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 3 disaster sequences, I think|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  true, but they didn't survive one of them:)|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|nt|athene: no problems in the play here|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|andyv:  fortunate location of K@d makes this hand|pg||
nt|athene: north has the club stop so the @SJ is protected|pg||
nt|athene: and @DK onside too|pg||
nt|othered1: and didn't even have to face a scary @D lead|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  I don't like 3N with xx in @ds on this type of auction|pg||
nt|othered1: but how sophisticated are their auctions after 2@C?|pg||
nt|athene: touch problem for north here|pg||
nt|athene: if you split, pd has stiff @CK|pg||
nt|athene: if you don't, declarer puts the @C10 :)|pg||
nt|athene: *tough problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzuq: N is thinking|pg||
pc|c2|nt|othered1: north is looking at @DK, making partner's holding @CK less likely|pg||
nt|athene: in view of the spade position, though, declarer may be unwilling to duck a club to south|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably right play...W can't afford S in the lead|pg||
nt|athene: but north's pause surely makes it a lively possibility|pg||
nt|athene: the @C10 is still safe|pg||
nt|athene: opps can't run four spades against you|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzuq: West is thinking now:)|pg||
nt|athene: you are guaranteed five clubs, @SA, @HAK, @DA|pg||

nt|athene: EW in the other room had their first bad board|pg||
nt|athene: not finding the diamond lead|pg||

nt|othered1: as they say, those auctions "demand" a trump lead . . . |pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, scratch all that:)|pg||
nt|athene: Drijver doubled 4@S for penalties|pg||
nt|athene: a bit like a spectacular hand last set when 6@H got doubles|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks everyone and bye|pg||
nt|athene: and opps could have run to 7@C or 7NT making|pg||

nt|Walddk2: yes, 680|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N was entitled to @HJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we come to the last deal|pg||
nt|chick: with two boards to go, it's back to a close contest again |pg||
nt|chick: oops one board to play|pg||
mb|1C|nt|fabsayc: skawina probably needs another swing to qualify|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Looks like everybody's 3nt.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andyv:  this board created some excitement in the OR|pg||
nt|april7: tricky hand, 6@C makes and 6@H goes down,lets see what EW will play|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|nulda: 2 spades from NS|pg||
nt|nulda: 3 spades go down definitely|pg||
nt|cherdano:  3@D is a good preempt here with 3-1 in the majors|pg||
nt|nulda: but 3d should go down too|pg||
nt|oliverc: but we said that about the 3NT, nulda|pg||
nt|josj: and even more i the oher match on BBO :)|pg||
nt|josj: in|pg||
nt|josj: what about 7NT on a vienna coup?|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 6N is off the top|pg||
nt|andyv:  7N on vienna:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they were in 10th place, 5 behind the 8th and last qualifying spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 9 corrected to 12 tricks|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  Hi Avram and Jos|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|nulda: 3d one down I would bet|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Transfer to 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: There are two sequences possible. 1N-4@C-4@H and 1N-2@D-2@H-4@H.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Unless the latter is a slam try.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: partnerships can have fun deciding which sequence means what|pg||
nt|gulyas: the latter shows some slam interest in my book|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sunit: 88/91 now|pg||
nt|april7: hi, but would you like to be in 7NT? 6 @C is enough, but they will also play 6@H like in OR|pg||
nt|josj: nope...|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, 7 is for hands you want to make the newpaper column on|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: reasonable action from macura|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Killing lead.|pg||
nt|josj: that's why I hope someone will bid 7 :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and the double of 6@H too for that matter|pg||
nt|gulyas: a nice triple squeeze really|pg||
nt|gulyas: that double is uncalled for|pg||
nt|april7: S should not X, they might run to NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl of 6@h in OR seemed suicidal, but neither W or E budged...almost like a deer caught in the headlights|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: yes, absolutely|pg||
nt|Walddk4: same happened in the other match|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6@C in one room, 6@HX in the other|pg||
nt|april7: but will E pass 6@C???|pg||
nt|andyv:  missing a control, W may opt for 6@c |pg||
nt|april7: he really should!!!|pg||
nt|april7: Q of @C a very big card!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@S is a convenient response to RKCK. 2 aces and trump queen. He has that whether hearts or clubs are trumps :)|pg||
nt|april7: decisive board!!|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cherdano:  yes first three tricks|pg||
nt|april7: W might opt for 6NT?|pg||
nt|mildredb: :)  didn't know there was a Mildred!  |pg||
nt|andyv:  W hasn't shown any support for @hs... time for E to reevaluate the Q@c|pg||
nt|april7: is 5NT a proposition to play?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=11  for standings after 11 rounds. First 8 after 13 rounds advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: tomorrow. One more round of Swiss after this, in about 30 minutes|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, sounds more like we have all the controls|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cherdano:  and @DAQ|pg||
nt|oliverc: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=9|pg||
nt|nulda: so 5 more Imps to J-C theam|pg||
pc|dK|nt|april7: then they might play 7NT , but W knows a control is missing|pg||
nt|nickd: no, after club jump ace asking is with @c suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, RKC was for @cs here|pg||
nt|andyv:  and E shows the k@s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh well, goodbye to 6@C and 6@H. I think the Greeks stop in 6NT|pg||
nt|april7: then 7NT is possible and a good player will make it|pg||
nt|gulyas: or 7@C:)|pg||
nt|ritong: @c to the 9?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|cherdano:  hi Henri!|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|nulda: 64-1 and 25-0|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ritong: he accepts to pay double partscore swing, knowing he has a good score sheet, and if 4@s is on, pard will probably bid again|pg||
nt|nickd: well at least 5 imps for greek team:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: S not happy, he wanted a @H contract:)|pg||
nt|ritong: of course|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  now we can see how well declarer plays this... S can be squeezed in the majors|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Thanks all, back in 1 hour and a wee bit. Enjoy your breakfast, lunch, dinner, nightcap, whatever|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, he avoids a big accident|pg||
nt|cherdano:  you would pass and jump to 4@S over a reopening double?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: in that specific context|pg||
nt|nulda: I have to go to work unfortunately in the afternoon, so good luck for the Czech juniors :)|pg||
nt|ritong: otherwise, i bid my hand with 3@s|pg||
nt|nulda: it would be nice to see them in the play-off|pg||
nt|cherdano:  they are on their way Vladimir!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are almost there already|pg||
nt|ritong: they will|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|nulda: I hope so|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You don't think he will make it, Nikos?|pg||
nt|andyv:  either way, a nice gain for the Greek team|pg||
nt|april7: we see this but how should W know??|pg||
pc|c4|nt|santyclz: Your day to go to the track, Henri.|pg||
