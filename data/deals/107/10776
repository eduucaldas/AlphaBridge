nt|cherdano:  btw, the swing on board 1 was caused by East's action over 1@S - he overcalled 1NT in the other room|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cherdano:  which looks very reasonable to me|pg||
nt|nulda: they play 1@h 14-20 5+|pg||

nt|gulyas: and so does 5@C:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it looks as if it takes a diamond lead to beat 6@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  so maybe North is tempted to bid more than 3@H here?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gulyas: I guess NS should sacrifice, all the way to 6@S:)|pg||

nt|nulda: but 3d should go down too|pg||
nt|oliverc: but we said that about the 3NT, nulda|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: 9 corrected to 12 tricks|pg||
