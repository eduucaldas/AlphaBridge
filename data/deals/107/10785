nt|Walddk4: tomorrow|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: E is one of the several good Drijver brothers:) Bob I think|pg||
nt|gulyas: OK, confirmed, its Bob|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@C either a multi of some sort, or a major 2 suiter (but my guess is, its a multi variation)|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@S was pass or correct|pg||
nt|chick: which means W may need to decide if 3@S could be a real suit|pg||
nt|gulyas: the double was just showing a good hand I would think, and I have no clue what 3@S would want to mean:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: OK, I am told that 2@C was in fact BOTH majors|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|gulyas: 5-4 and up|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|gulyas: hey Joe:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  this seems like the normal auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: without a @S lead are 5 @C possible but 5@D bye NS are in|pg||
nt|april7: 6@C though is a good save by EW|pg||
nt|mdgraham: some might have bid 2@D over 1@H with the North hand - king to six not to be sneezed at |pg||
nt|santyclz: Re Daniel.|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Ozgur and Daniel|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello everyone, welcome to the second half of the QFs |pg||
pc|hT|nt|gulyas: USA Blue topped the field after 13 rounds, by a huge 46VP margin, so they are the hot favourites here|pg||
nt|garnetts: No reason for west not to lead a heart--|pg||
nt|garnetts: The contract is safe anyway|pg||
nt|gulyas: altho a @S lead would have been more testing|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: easy 3NT first up|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=10  for standings after 10 rounds. First 8 after 13 rounds advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: tomorrow|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS getting to 5@D now|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|gulyas: N will pull that|pg||
nt|gulyas: he does have a 6card support and a void after all:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: so then obv 3@S was SHOWING stop, since the opps have 2 suits|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello Andy, Ozgur|pg||
nt|andyv:  good contract|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cherdano:  North is 5-5 but has bad suits and the wrong shape to act over 2@H in the passout seat|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, well bid by NS|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gulyas: hmm|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The Curse of the Commentator strikes again|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|april7: and no defensive values at all and is vul. so a pullwould be obvious, but I also think the X was not the best bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: I agree with that too|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Joe :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: and hoping for 3NT with @H stop, but that all was messed up by S's 4@S bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=12  for standings after 12 rounds. Top 8 after this round advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: tomorrow|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Corielia.  |pg||
nt|chick: I don't know about "messed up", NS down at least a couple :)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|gulyas: so currently, Italy Red are 5th, Australia 9th, both fighting for qualification|pg||
nt|gulyas: it is so good that it actually makes:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|april7: rather 6@D than X i would suggest|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gulyas: well, their well thought out defence was messed up:)|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|gulyas: Greecoura is a Greek team, they finished 5th in the preliminaries|pg||
nt|andyv:  nothing to the play|pg||
nt|gulyas: I assume USA Blue picked them as opponents for the QF|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the USA team chose them for this round.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|april7: but one should not be to greedy|pg||
nt|garnetts: well it would be more testing but will still make --provided declarer holds up and takes two finesses into east|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gulyas: it looks like NS loses at least 1 trick in each suit|pg||
nt|santyclz: Quite a x by w with his powerhouse.  Looks as if it will work out well though.|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|garnetts: would have to take it on a spade lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: probably|pg||
nt|gulyas: he is afraid that all finesses are off|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|santyclz: Excuse me, *her* powerhouse.|pg||
nt|chick: well, E did double and then cuebid even with W's pass|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|gulyas: he did refuse one finesse already...|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: declarer will not be certain who has the long clubs - if he thinks East has them, he will play diamonds normally - if West, he may run @DJ  |pg||
nt|gulyas: so if he ducks this, he gets a @H play, and the defense will have 5 tricks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gulyas: forcing dummy is a good idea, that way they cannot use the side suit in @Hs|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|gulyas: so if @Ss are 6-2, he has to take it|pg||
nt|gulyas: but he got it right|pg||
nt|garnetts: Might go off if he plays east to have bared a notional K@D in the end game|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/VGData/minirama.html  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|gulyas: he also might go off if he tries to endplay E|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d2|nt|gulyas: 4@H would have been 1 off probably|pg||
pc|c6|nt|gulyas: they are lucky this went down at all|pg||
nt|gulyas: with @Ds 1-1|pg||
nt|gulyas: unless they find the @S ruff|pg||
nt|chick: this is going to be a big swing to start the round ... wonder how it will affect morale for the rest|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|gulyas: he will just play them normally, it is not likely that W plays @Cs that way if he had 5 of them|pg||
nt|mdgraham: either of which will work|pg||
nt|gulyas: right now, the @D finesse looks safe|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d3|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d4|nt|gulyas: oh-oh, he is going for the endplay|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c7|nt|garnetts: Strange hand but he played it well--the operation was a success but the patient died |pg||
pc|h9|pc|d5|pc|s7|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|gulyas: he could have gone down if @Cs were 4-4 tho|pg||
nt|gulyas: so, a push here, not surprisingly|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d7|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dT|mc|9|nt|gulyas: oh, E discarded wrong|pg||

nt|Walddk4: tomorrow|pg||
nt|andyv:  same contract in OR|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think decalrer deserved that for a fine line of play--but east will be gutted|pg||
nt|gulyas: the only time he cannot take the @D finesse was if @Ss were 4-4|pg||
mb|1D|nt|gulyas: but if the @Ss ran, he had 9 tricks from top|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, if @SJ had fallen, he would have had nine on top|pg||
nt|april7: an easy 3NT by NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  E hand a deceptively poor opener|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3 aces is always a good opener|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Macura|pg||
nt|nulda: 1s sound overcall 12+|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: snap :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: so I don't totally agree with you there|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|gulyas: EW can try 3NT, but it fails if it gets a @D lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: but yes, it was E who did the last wrong thing|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|cherdano:  and 2NT artificial?|pg||
nt|nulda: North player - Michal Kopecky - had a bid success at San Remo a month ago|pg||
nt|nulda: 5th place in Open Pairs category|pg||
nt|cherdano:  that is a nice result indeed|pg||
nt|nulda: 2NT relay|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that 1@C opening is not so much skinny as anorexic |pg||
nt|mdgraham: as Daniel said,,passing 5@Cx with a void and six card trump support just looked wrong|pg||
nt|april7: 9 or 10 tricks, depending on the play|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  no spot cards make the hand poor|pg||
nt|gulyas: spot cards are bad, agree there|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d lead almost called for on this auction|pg||
nt|gulyas: lets see if S finds the killing lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: unless pd has a @H honor...|pg||
nt|gulyas: but I agree, @Ds should be led|pg||
nt|andyv:  sometimes you have to trust the opps|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: weird|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@C as we have seen is both majors, x probably showing a wk NT worth hand, or any strong hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: since this time its 13 balanced, she passed the forward-going 3@C|pg||
nt|gulyas: this looks like 4 tricks off the top, but with the @H ruff also coming, it will probably go down|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh-oh|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this will be over quickly|pg||
pc|c9|nt|nulda: 3s minimum |pg||
nt|gulyas: with trumps not behaving, 2@S is the limit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but you can't imagine South passing now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5 imps, as 6@Cx-2 in the Open Room|pg||
nt|garnetts: The killing lead --if South gets it right|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|cherdano:  and South has second thoughts about inviting?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: o\_/ hand|pg||
nt|chick: excellent duck|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lovely.  Tough play.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cherdano:  on a diamond lead South will set up clubs and a club ruff for an easy +650|pg||
nt|nulda: just two aces to give|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: Nab is calling TD after 4@s|pg||
nt|cherdano:  oh - if north bid a slow 3@S then there may be a problem|pg||
nt|nulda: I dont think, there should be a problem|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=9  for standings after 9 rounds. First 8 after 13 rounds advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: tomorrow|pg||
nt|nulda: 4@s normal bid after 2s of N|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, if N's bidding suggested an 11-13 range, I would|pg||
nt|gulyas: duck is a good move, now he just needs to have his entries to take all the finesses he needs|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|cherdano:  yes but why did South bid 2N?|pg||
nt|gulyas: S only trusted his own suit, and that backfired|pg||
nt|gulyas: he has to take this and return it, or duck the 1st round|pg||
pc|d6|nt|gulyas: since N's @S10 can be the setting trick|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh|pg||
pc|d9|nt|gulyas: I guess it didn't:)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|garnetts: Nothing else to do actually--but he found it|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|nulda: probably slam trying :)|pg||
nt|chick: but it also cuts off communication for the heart ruff|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  a big pick up for Blue as OR stopped at 3@c|pg||
nt|gulyas: 7 IMPs to the US team instead of 5 the other way|pg||
nt|gulyas: the Greeks cannot afford too many mistakes like this|pg||
nt|andyv:  the lead is tough and K@d was the only entry to S's hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  as one spec points out, the contracted was also right sided|pg||
nt|andyv:  contract|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|gulyas: good save there|pg||
nt|garnetts: that is very poor play |pg||
nt|gulyas: N can still work this out|pg||
nt|gulyas: take it and play a @C|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|garnetts: but North might save the day |pg||
pc|c5|nt|cherdano:  that would be a little aggressive :) |pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: it always seems to happen - you open light and pard piles you into game|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, that will help with avoiding the ruff|pg||
nt|gulyas: a @D would work as well|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cherdano:  especially if the overcall showed 12+|pg||
nt|nulda: as far as I know Milan Macura, he tryies for a slam on every opportunity|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i see|pg||
nt|cherdano:  here a duck by East would have given declarer a small problem to think about|pg||
nt|cherdano:  whether to take the @S finesse at all|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|garnetts: well done |pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello Joe|pg||
nt|mdgraham: of course, that may not be a light opening for NS. They may have an agreement that they open such hands |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hey Joe|pg||
nt|april7: a play to J of @H would have been a better idea than finesse in @C , this finesse had time to be done|pg||
pc|h2|nt|santyclz: Hi Dan, Mike.|pg||
nt|gulyas: since N chose @Ss, @Hs was likely to be 5-2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gulyas: if they do, S certainly overbid|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

nt|cherdano:  btw, the swing on board 1 was caused by East's action over 1@S - he overcalled 1NT in the other room|pg||
nt|chick: lots of good inferences to make ... well done!|pg||
nt|santyclz: This looks like fun.|pg||
nt|gulyas: since he decided to overcall with that pile, at least he should have known that THAT suit is well stopped|pg||

mb|2H|nt|cherdano:  so maybe North is tempted to bid more than 3@H here?|pg||
nt|gulyas: these teams are currently 8th and 6th, respectively, so they are both in the heat of qualifying (top8 Qs)|pg||
nt|andyv:  W felt he had to do something but 5 card minor suit overcalls at 2 level rarely gain anything|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gulyas: 5@D would be sensible, it is almost certain that EW has a Vul game, and this will go for 300 max|pg||
nt|gulyas: this is when u gently lean over and ask 'no more @Cs, partner?':)|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S is very agressive--prefer double to show spades with at least tolerance for clubs|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|gulyas: I guess NS should sacrifice, all the way to 6@S:)|pg||
nt|april7: another 3NT but a litle more tricky|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: N, with no defense whatsoever outside @Ss could go to 5@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will lead a club, surely....and be somewhat narked by the outcome|pg||
nt|april7: now its easier again for N|pg||
nt|gulyas: now he has 9 tricks|pg||
nt|gulyas: his suit lacks the intermediates, so its a soso overcall (with a passed pd, I would pass)|pg||
mb|p|nt|nulda: in CR 4spades made from EW|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, the so-called snapdragon double|pg||
pc|c7|nt|april7: I think N has still to find J of @S|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@H makes here too |pg||
nt|garnetts: They may well have this sorted but I would certainly have bid 4@S as East if my partner had bid 2@S|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gulyas: 3@C,3@D,2@H,1@S should be enough:)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|april7: he can finesse J of @C|pg||
nt|gulyas: same contract in the OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  in mp I might bid the hand... I just don't see it's value in imps esp. when vul|pg||
nt|gulyas: vul against not is very dangerous|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@S would have been 500, so it was a good call to let it go|pg||
pc|s6|nt|santyclz: I'm conflicted about that, n having limited his hand with 1nt should usually leave such descisions to his pd, but this may be an exception.|pg||
nt|gulyas: E will take his 4 tops, thank you very much, and folds up soon after|pg||
nt|chick: must cash all tricks right now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|april7: E might develop10th trick by playing @S|pg||
nt|april7: but E will probably lead @D now|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|cherdano:  maybe North could have raised to 3@H right away|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @DJ looked a bit safer|pg||
pc|s2|nt|nulda: W a bit two strong for 2s I suppose, 1s would be better|pg||
nt|cherdano:  to allow partner to bid 4 with extras|pg||
nt|santyclz: Unlucky might very well get out for -1 if played by s.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|gulyas: E could have saved the day with a NF 2@H, but it could be wrong on other hands|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andyv:  W will do well to go -2 on this|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|cherdano:  yes the heavy jump caused EW to miss game here|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl dummy, W cashes one more @S, switches to @h, and after 3 rounds, then leads @s|pg||
pc|hT|nt|gulyas: nice suit pref by discarding the @HJ|pg||
nt|chick: true, but wasn't much other choice anyway :)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|gulyas: yes, thats what I meant|pg||
nt|andyv:  good switch|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s8|nt|gulyas: so Bob knew he could not open up a trick in @Cs|pg||
nt|gulyas: N could have had @CA and @SK in theory|pg||
nt|gulyas: and pd with @CKT|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|cherdano:  Ozgur, was 2@S explained as weak?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d6|nt|gulyas: now @H ruff, and then the @S to promote another trump trick|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|andyv:  good d|pg||
nt|garnetts: It is 500 but not clear cut to double perhaps --can be a useful investment for a couple of imps if they go on and go off|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|nt|nulda: 13 IMPs for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: yes 2@s was weak|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|murat e: this is a battle btw majors|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  I guess this is how they show an invitational hand with spades|pg||
nt|murat e: this shd be an inviting sequence which east cannot accept|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I agree. East has nothing extra and really ought to pass|pg||
nt|elbec: maybe he fears west has only 5 spades...|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|april7: a @H partscore for EW,2@H and 3@D for NS|pg||

nt|chick: made even more boring by the lead :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|nulda: why not 1h?|pg||

mb|2S|nt|oliverc: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|gulyas: I don't know how 2@H would have fared...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cherdano:  i am corrected - team 42 also is transnational, with 4 different nationalities|pg||
nt|nulda: do not give an invitation to Macura, I know|pg||
nt|gulyas: a very disciplined pass by E on the 16 cound|pg||
nt|gulyas: *count|pg||
mb|3H|nt|cherdano:  I kind of like 2NT|pg||
nt|cherdano:  with all those queens|pg||
nt|cherdano:  NT may well play better than hearts|pg||
nt|oliverc: well this contract will get everything it deserves|pg||
nt|gulyas: lead a trump and watch it fall apart|pg||
nt|april7: @H lead is best and E will go 2 down|pg||
nt|gulyas: asking for pd to bid 3NT with a @D stop|pg||
nt|andyv:  question of how to play the @CS... cash Ace first or dbl hook?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: probably making - can engineer a club ruff in the West hand|pg||
nt|april7: then only 1 down, but canot make it|pg||
nt|gulyas: cashing the A is the safety play|pg||
nt|andyv:  this takes all the pressure off|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: really bad hand W has|pg||
nt|mdgraham: trump lead often best on these types of auction |pg||
nt|gulyas: as long as he doesn't put up the @CJ but ruffs out the Q, he can get home in 2@H (no trump lead)|pg||
nt|april7: but he is in 3@H|pg||
nt|gulyas: that will not make|pg||
nt|gulyas: the only excitement would have come from playing in 4@S, but that would have made as well|pg||
nt|andyv:  S might have dbld 3@s to suggest lead but his @Ss weren't terrific.|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|gulyas: don't see why he should bid 1@D|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gulyas: the good news is, now declarer has 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gulyas: he should have let the opps venture into 3-4@S and go down|pg||
nt|santyclz: It wouldn't have occurred to me.  1@s would have, but I would have resisted.|pg||
nt|gulyas: other room, a huge result for Australia|pg||
nt|gulyas: especially since 3@D is not making|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lead can't be right, that's what I would have led.|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes--might have doubled 2@H to suggest a TOD without spades maybe--but very disciplined --K@D looks better to me |pg||
nt|gulyas: the bad news is, there will be no more|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: not the best of starts for the defence|pg||
nt|april7: but without a X its 2 imps save|pg||
nt|chick: lol|pg||
nt|gulyas: most ppl would have tried 1NT or 2@C there|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gulyas: so a doubled overtrick is unexpected:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: over 1@H|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|gulyas: I would have led a @H, but that still would not have helped:)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|gulyas: but with only a half stopper, and a really crummy 5c suit, I agree with the pass|pg||
pc|hK|nt|santyclz: I'm of the old school that if an overcall doesn't take away any space it should be on full values.  The more space it takes away the less solid it has to be.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suspect that the double of 3@D was intended as take-out |pg||
nt|andyv:  claim time|pg||
nt|gulyas: long, bad @Ss|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|nulda: two down probably and 6 IMPs back to the Netherlands|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|cherdano:  although given the NS agreements, i dont think it is so attractive - opposite 15-17 balanced you will get to game anyway, and opposite an unbalanced hand diamonds or hearts may still play better|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|gulyas: probably|pg||
nt|garnetts: WEell 2@C is dreadful in my view--1NT has all of the wrong feel too--this east looks like a well coached player to me|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gulyas: one trick running away here too? no|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gulyas: 2 down, and 12 IMPs to Australia|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|april7: now they lose 4imps|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c3|nt|oliverc: I can't see any reason NOT to bid 1@H over 1@D|pg||
nt|oliverc: and I can't see ANY reason to bid 3NT over 2NT :)|pg||
nt|nulda: as I said, do not give an invitation do Milan Macura, you can bid a game itself instead|pg||
nt|cherdano:  yes the south hand looked good UNTIL partner suggested NT|pg||
nt|cherdano:  as long as East keeps his club here he is fine|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|cherdano:  but of course he should pitch a heart to beat the contract two tricks|pg||
pc|d8|nt|gulyas: both are having problems there, agree|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|oliverc: jeepers|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s5|pg||

nt|gulyas: hello Oliver|pg||
nt|garnetts: Hi Oliver |pg||
nt|oliverc: hi everyone|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|nulda: so how good is not to tell your 4 card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 4@S just making,5@C on trump lead 1 down|pg||
nt|april7: in 4@S E must find the J of @H though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South can get two ruffs, though|pg||
nt|april7: only 1|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would ruff out @Ds and make 5@C|pg||
nt|gulyas: they went to 6@D, which would not have been too bad, but then REDOUBLED!|pg||
nt|garnetts: North got in first lol|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@S look OK to me as South to keep hearts out|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|cherdano:  2@H probably shows 6 spades|pg||
nt|nulda: 1c 18-20 bal or 11+nat or 21+ anything|pg||
nt|oliverc: Well if EW are defending that poorly, South's decision to raise to game fully|pg||
nt|oliverc: justified, I suppose|pg||
nt|nulda: yes they play transfers in competitive bidding|pg||
mb|d|nt|cherdano:  NS in the other room got pushed to 5@S|pg||
nt|cherdano:  after East jump-overcalled 2@H|pg||
nt|nulda: probably 4h from N|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @DA, @D ruff, @HA, @D ruff|pg||
nt|gulyas: you have the @C8 as an entry too:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but possibly academic as South might lead a top club against 4@S, if he let EW play it there|pg||
nt|april7: y 5@C can be made|pg||
nt|andyv:  N taking a very conservative approach with his hand|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4H|nt|april7: so 5@S is a good save|pg||
nt|gulyas: now, that was 1000 away|pg||
nt|gulyas: his @S suit is really bad quality|pg||
nt|gulyas: but overall, a nice hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, but rest of hand quite excellent for 2@s opener|pg||
nt|gulyas: both 4@H and 4@S has merit, but they are not making on the actual layout |pg||
nt|garnetts: I wonder what the double of 2NT meant|pg||
nt|gulyas: but NS has to find the immediate @C ruff to beat it|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not at all clear to bid if you ask me |pg||
nt|gulyas: and EW needs the @D ruff to beat 4@S, more or less|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: and 12 to CKIS |pg||
mb|p|nt|nulda: another chance for NS to stop in game|pg||
nt|gulyas: 5@C a real sacrifice this time|pg||
nt|chick: sad|pg||
nt|gulyas: an agressive t/o dbl over 2NT I would think|pg||
nt|gulyas: found the right hand with pd|pg||
mb|d|nt|oliverc: ...and will probably make 11 tricks, too, just to rub salt in the wounds|pg||
nt|nulda: 5s from N hand should be make|pg||
nt|cherdano:  North decided 4@S was enough - with the added benefit of protecting his @HAQ on the lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: if he had a decent @S suit (say, KT98 instead of K765), I would agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 5@S makes on the trump finesse|pg||
nt|gulyas: I wonder if this is a lighter double here|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am sure he would like it to be:)|pg||
nt|oliverc: that would make sense|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|gulyas: 5@Cx will go 2 down most likely|pg||
nt|gulyas: unless N decides to do something foolish:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice 5@C bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@S is not a good save. 800 on best defence|pg||
nt|gulyas: N thought S had a great hand, whereas he was just running with his 7 carder and nothing else|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Lawful 20 tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: franchý called director|pg||
nt|gulyas: S was not so sure, so he pulled |pg||
nt|garnetts: Can hardly be anyhting else--you know this 2NT bid led to this--why bother with it |pg||
nt|gulyas: N could think that after 2NT, this is a forcing situation|pg||
nt|oliverc: muddying the waters, perhaps|pg||
nt|gulyas: so then x is just weakness|pg||
nt|gulyas: but S could clearly see that N is probably very short in @Cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and another imp for the Greek team|pg||
nt|gulyas: actually 6@D is not a bad contract from the right side|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't get rid of the clubs|pg||
nt|gulyas: discard it on the @Hs|pg||
nt|andyv:  now he can|pg||
nt|gulyas: we will see if 4@S will be beat|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|nulda: in CR 5s was played from S hand, so one down|pg||
nt|gulyas: now overtake with the A, return a @S...|pg||
nt|gulyas: double fit is always extra|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South can't know that North has six diamonds, but overtaking was possible. Not likely to lead from Kx against this auction |pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, had to open my eyes:)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzur: litte break|pg||
nt|cherdano:  probably a good idea for EW|pg||
nt|cherdano:  of course EW don't take any blame for the loss on this board - their teammates taking the push to 5@S was the costly decision|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h8|nt|chick: I say never redouble a slam.  (unless you have 13 spades)  The opponents are nuts to double unless they have something you don't expect (and I never assume the opps are nuts) :)|pg||
nt|ritong: at least they know who will offer the drinks when they are qualified|pg||
pc|hT|nt|gulyas: as long as N doesn't want to play a hero, they will have their 4 tricks|pg||

nt|gulyas: oh:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, with trumps 3-0, he may not be able to take all the tricks he wants|pg||

nt|Walddk4: tomorrow|pg||
nt|andyv:  and a new leader|pg||
nt|oliverc: plenty of scope for West to fall in love with their hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: The @d fit remained undisclosed.|pg||
nt|gulyas: this looks more like 8 tricks|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4S!|nt|nulda: 2s minimum, 5 cards|pg||
nt|andyv:  8 for sure, mayb be 9 with 2 spade pitches|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|cherdano:  i am surprised North didnt try for game|pg||
nt|oliverc: ...and no fairytale if they do, since North has the wrong singleton @H honour|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|cherdano:  oh i see 2s showed a minimum|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@D, 2@S, 2@C|pg||
nt|andyv:  yeap|pg||
nt|gulyas: they may get too high now|pg||
nt|oliverc: no. should stop there|pg||
mb|p|nt|nulda: Michal has to have good brakes to stop in 2|pg||
nt|oliverc: (5@H)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|gulyas: you should use the 6c keycard bw here|pg||
nt|oliverc: or 5@S|pg||
nt|garnetts: they must take the A@D |pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|oliverc: apparently 7@S in the other room|pg||
nt|gulyas: 7??|pg||
nt|oliverc: so I'm told|pg||
nt|garnetts: North may not see it that way|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|gulyas: this is going down a lot now|pg||
nt|gulyas: I guess they don't use BW at all|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, with a @S lead, this is going down a lot|pg||
nt|garnetts: Hadn't noticed the South void--lightner comes into play|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: but it was brave from N to come in with that hand after 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|nulda: so another swing to Japan-Czech team, well done up to now|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh-oh|pg||
nt|garnetts: can switch to spades though--6@S |pg||
nt|gulyas: but didn't|pg||
nt|gulyas: now this will be 500|pg||
nt|oliverc: Any feelings on 6@H by East after West's sign-off?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes--crazy|pg||
nt|gulyas: agree:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: he just liked his 3 aces too much|pg||
nt|oliverc: unforgiveable, I feel|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gulyas: showing his A9xxx as a suit to play...|pg||
nt|gulyas: will N find the @S lead? should not be too hard|pg||
nt|gulyas: doh|pg||
pc|dT|nt|gulyas: 6 more to Italy Red|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|cherdano:  West would have done better to start with the @DK, rather than a low @D|pg||
nt|gulyas: now the @DJ to ask for a @S?|pg||
nt|gulyas: hmm|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, still 2 down if he gets his ruff|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe the juniors don't smoke any more, or use matches:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: 5@H would likely go off too then --oddly no one doubled 7@S so they will gain for that if it goes 2 off---strange game|pg||
nt|gulyas: I mean really, what was N thinking??|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not thinking I imagine|pg||
nt|gulyas: he is lucky it goes down at all|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|cherdano:  so his partner can win the second diamond|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2 down, which is not too bad since EW can make a few overtricks in @H partials|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|cherdano:  and play a club through|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gulyas: well, 8 to the Greek, leading 10-8 now|pg||

nt|gulyas: I hate to say this, but I did not agree then either:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: S could have helped with the @DJ|pg||
nt|garnetts: flat board|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes|pg||

nt|gulyas: so did we|pg||
nt|oliverc: clearly not obvious enough|pg||
nt|garnetts: both sides richly rewarded for their efforts|pg||
nt|gulyas: only person not sure was N...|pg||
nt|gulyas: agree, neither team deserved anything for their showing on this hand|pg||

nt|santyclz: Technically he should cash @da first as he can handle !j10xx in s but not in n.  Entry problems might have precluded it anyway.|pg||
nt|gulyas: 10 tricks and an IMP|pg||
nt|gulyas: how many boards is the QF? 2x14?|pg||
nt|andyv:  i think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: 14 boards 2 rounds|pg||

mb|p|nt|cherdano:  (ruff and overruff, diamond ruffed by partner's ace, and another club)|pg||

nt|oliverc: absolutely|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: another wk balanced hand opened - are we getting too old?:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: regrettably, yes|pg||

nt|santyclz: Over/under on this hand 4@h?|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: it does seem to be the modern style to open balanced 11-counts |pg||
nt|andyv:  a sparse 11 count but 3-3 in majors make it a marginal opener|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|cherdano:  how strong is 2@D?|pg||
nt|gulyas: I can see opening wk hands with distribution opened, I do that sometimes too, but a balanced 11 count...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Of course at their age I was playing "western rabbit" in which all 10hcp hands were mandatory openers.|pg||
nt|gulyas: these are the hands where you can get VERY frustrated with pd|pg||

nt|oliverc: Netherlands|pg||
nt|nulda: looks like 25 : -25 :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: the problem comes when partner plays you for full values -  see for example board 12|pg||
nt|gulyas: right, pd will raise u to game with 12 counts, and will go down|pg||
nt|gulyas: 170 in the OR|pg||
nt|gulyas: not the best defense there|pg||
nt|oliverc: All the EW pairs there will be breathing a sigh of relief to get out with a push|pg||
nt|garnetts: This one is fairly normal--little to be said about it|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|gulyas: this could make, 4@S+2@D tricks to start with|pg||
nt|fabsayc: one step at a time, i think, 1-4 get to choose from 5-8|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|andyv:  I would have passed|pg||
nt|gulyas: almost identical bidding here to the OR|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|gulyas: a @C trick will develop eventually|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|gulyas: declarer will end up with an extra overtrick or 2 here|pg||
nt|andyv:  nothing prevents E from being 3-3-2-5 on this hand and, with a 10 count little reason to use garbage stayman|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|hT|nt|chick: I don't think S should spend the @HA yet?|pg||

nt|gulyas: well, you need to have SOME sort of a forcing bid|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  identical auction|pg||

nt|gulyas: 1NT should be his rebid|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: However having a general cue-bid available is a good idea, so even against short clubs 2@C is useful as a cue  |pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cJ|nt|nulda: 2 out of 5 without the Q, even S found the brake pedal|pg||
nt|cherdano:  but maybe it is rather North who bid too much here|pg||
nt|cherdano:  he is minimum in their style, has a void in partner's suit|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cherdano:  and made two cuebids after a reverse|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=9  for standings after 9 rounds. First 8 after 13 rounds advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: tomorrow|pg||
nt|cherdano:  this is a bit of speculation of course as we don't know their exact agreement|pg||
nt|nulda: so 3 more RR matches in the afternoon|pg||
nt|gulyas: since N could be any strong hand, all S showed was his pattern, not his overall strength|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cherdano:  5@S is already uncomfortably high|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is, but cards are very friendly|pg||
nt|cherdano:  how would you play it though? any 4-1 trump break is dangerous|pg||
nt|oliverc: You're asking the wrong person  -  Roland would be in 7 here LOL|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Win the club, cash two top spades ending in hand. If no queen, work with hearts. If West has four trumps I am still ok. Can't do anything if East has Q10xx anyway|pg||
nt|oliverc: sounds right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unblock @HQ first of course|pg||
nt|cherdano:  you still run into problems with spades 4-1 onside i think roland|pg||
nt|cherdano:  say you ruff a heart,how you dont have an entry back to hand|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i think you should play @DK earlier|pg||
nt|cherdano:  to set up a diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't I lead a spade up later? Requires that West has four hearts along with four trumps|pg||
nt|april7: N gets an uppercut in @S now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: how to make now?|pg||
nt|chick: start by winning the spade lead :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|santyclz: Every journey...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cherdano:  seems better to knock out @DA earlier, to get the @DQ as entry back to hand|pg||
pc|sA|nt|april7: tricky now,@S King and @C J discrding the @H loser|pg||
nt|april7: or overruffing and discarding later|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: i want to go back and play 3nt|pg||

mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: Not sure if Manno has a scientific wayt to proceed here, but 3NT is not encouraging. Only 2 hearts opposite and likely wasted values in spades|pg||

pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: I don't know what 4NT is, but it can't have been ace asking. Do they play Turbo on this auction I wonder|pg||

nt|gulyas: going for 800 in an active game (ie. not a save) is not a good sign|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|april7: lucky distribution for 10 tricks in @H for NS|pg||

mb|p|nt|gulyas: Namyats, not my fav convention, to put it mildly:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Unenterprising with trump support and controls in all side suits (depending on what 4@d shows).|pg||
nt|andyv:  time for N to retire|pg||
nt|gulyas: lev5 is for the opps|pg||
mb|3S|nt|gulyas: he really has no reason to bid on|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  or the Zias of the world|pg||
nt|gulyas: with THAT hand?? ouch|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess we didn't should loud enough, Dan|pg||
nt|garnetts: Might get there if South bids 3@C and over 3NT continues with 4@D|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|oliverc: over 3@S or 4@H, does South have much reason to continue beyond 4@H, with the|pg||
nt|oliverc: likelyhood of wasted values in Spades|pg||
nt|garnetts: The 3@S seems might odd to me |pg||
mb|4D|nt|oliverc: no nasty surprises here|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: in the other room, N passed 3@H|pg||
nt|santyclz: Are they searching for 3nt or q'ing for a possible @c slam?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: priority is best game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: since neither has made forcing bids|pg||
nt|gulyas: totally flat hand, even 4@S was too high as we could see in the OR|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cherdano:  except for this lead!|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: freely cue-bidding 1st or second round controls|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: lovely double by drijver|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@C showing the first round control would leave South thinking his partner has little in the way of wasted spade values|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  he saw the white, not the 1100|pg||
nt|garnetts: I do not think that 4NT here should be blackwood|pg||
nt|oliverc: wow|pg||
nt|garnetts: If North bid the grand it might even make on the A@S lead|pg||
nt|oliverc: naive to lead the A@S after the 4@S bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have been told 4NT is blackwood--which doesn't shock me--just that it is a poor use of the bid in this auction |pg||
nt|gulyas: what is N thinking abt?|pg||
nt|gulyas: he really has nothing extra|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|chick: hopes to prevent spade ruffs?|pg||
nt|oliverc: Thanks all. I have to go|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|garnetts: I go on a very old principle that having shown your hand with the rebid of 2NT --blackwood is best left to partner--as are decisions  baout whether to bid the grand|pg||
nt|gulyas: I can understand that:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gulyas: I did not like the 4@S, but nv vs vul, I can see that - 5@S is unheard of|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||

nt|gulyas: S not happy, he wanted a @H contract:)|pg||
nt|ritong: of course|pg||

nt|andyv:  well, declarer will soon now W's distribution, so he may go for the 4-2 odds on the @sQ|pg||

nt|garnetts: what is the point of 2@D?  If you must bid then 2@H surely|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|gulyas: if that is trouble, I am willing to do that every day:)|pg||

nt|gulyas: 1NT is funny:)|pg||

pc|h4|nt|andyv:  and if non forcing how bad can the bid be?|pg||
nt|andyv:  6 to the Q and out?|pg||
nt|gulyas: I still doubt it could be worse than this|pg||
nt|gulyas: N, with a partial fit in @H should be able to see game somehow|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe his earlier 5@S bid backfired:)|pg||
