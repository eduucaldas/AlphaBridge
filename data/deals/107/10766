mb|p|nt|haans:  hi Geoffrey |pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|Walddk2: 2@C is Gazzilli, either natural 3+ cards or any 16+ hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: 2NT natural minimum|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|jcwla: South could double here to show the higher end of the 1NT with weak/short @D's.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: hgeelen has cc: www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/.../molenaar-verbeek.pdf |pg||
nt|cherdano:  with 4-4 in the majors, i would certainly double|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6@D is down on 22 so 13 to USA Blue.|pg||
nt|haans: agree with u there|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|haans: but only 1 down :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: south's bid helped west to find the 3N bid |pg||
nt|sharynr: even if not one's style. the south hand looks like a raise to 2@H|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Now that East passed 5@H, West will take another bid|pg||
nt|cindy:  thats the kind of hand i like to upgrade to 15|pg||
nt|sharynr: exceptions to rules, can be made|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jcwla: 2 is in from OR: 12 more to Neth. Orange for bidding and making 4@H doubled.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: But it won't be 1660 as one might have feared|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|onebid: now West passes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Are you sure?|pg||
nt|iris100:  looks like itÂ´s getting too high|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: and could make  i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree with cindy. i would either open 1N, or raise 1H to 2H, esp after opening in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|jcwla: KRE puts it at 14.85:  http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
nt|cindy:  has a better chance played from the S hand|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: that should do it for the bidding |pg||
nt|haans: yes maybe|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jaapfr: another 8 imps for Polish i presume|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|haans: i think 1@D is the normal transfer today|pg||
nt|lestergold: diamond barrage has not kept them out of the sensib le contract of 5c|pg||
nt|onebid: I think Liz was right - too much by NS|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks like it :(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but 5@S does make|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think 6@S makes.|pg||
nt|onebid: I do too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I must say that it's tempting to bid again over 4@S with Wilkinson's cards. NV and 5@H will not be expensive if they are allowed to play there|pg||
nt|iris100:  spade position dooms the contract|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in answer to the anti-upgradsers, suppose pd has, e.g.:   AJxxx  Kxx   x   xxxx. you have adequate play for 4S, but you will end in 1N or 2S if you open 1D and rebid 1N|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: needed the diamond force continued i think|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: probably right Hans |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|cindy:  low to the @dQ would be fun|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry typo AQxxx of spades|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: diamond may still get it off|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|onebid: but maybe give up after 5@S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Why would he fear that E-W can make slam after a 1-level overcall|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Same Auction the Polish South bid 5@D, which seemed to work better|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: did see the dummy did see it|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence could set up a diamond or spade trick to go with the ace of hearts but not both|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: 5cv of course is safe on a 4/2 heart break whereas 4h might have been shaky on such a break|pg||
nt|cindy:  W would probably not play K and if E has K thats ok too because cant lead @s|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|shevek: current results for the event at:  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Information.htm|pg||
nt|iris100:  should have tried for the crossruff, but it wouldnÂ´t have worked anyway - down 2 now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and for those who would not raise 1H to 2H, pd has:   KQT   JTxxx   xx  Kxx. your chances of 4H are good, and you will get there if you raise to 2H, but not if you rebid 1N|pg||
nt|sharynr: club now best|pg||
nt|sharynr: or spade, spade then club|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: call giving up|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm not convinced a trump was indicated|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: of course, individual hands prove nothing, but IMPs is about the big-ticket items, mainly gamnes, and the hands i have constructed are utterly routine, exactly the sorts of hands ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that swing matches|pg||
pc|dA|nt|shevek: but you have to be patient , refresh and click on Results, even if seems that's not working|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||

pc|h7|nt|jaapfr: in other room it was even unclear for EW who had the slam 6@H or 6@S?|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c8|nt|peachy: unnecessary finesse, although near guaranteed to work|pg||
pc|c7|nt|iris100:  w pitched a club|pg||
pc|s5|nt|onebid: Here, North might have passed 5@C dbld, but bid again - encouraging partner|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: You think the Pass more discouraging than 5@H? |pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: In denmark 12-14 NT is very popular and I believe most people would jump at the opportunity to open the S hand with 1NT. What do you think roland?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|nicksan: has a chance, especially if North leads a HIGH diamond...|pg||
nt|bbramley: that lead should tip the position to declarer, so he can later block the suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think so too I'm afraid, but I don't think it's worth it|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bbramley: pedestrian low spot lead might have been a winner for the defense|pg||
nt|jcmax: W should be able to read the opening lead as 2nd best from a bad holding and play low the next time N plays a diamond to block the suit|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jcmax: Italians are big attitude leaders, though, in general|pg||
nt|bbramley: south led 7 from Q1072 a couple of hands earlier|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, very much Italian style. The 2 would have promised a REALLY good suit|pg||
pc|d9|nt|nicksan: moment of truth...|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|bbramley: maybe trying to block the suit, hoping north had @D987 tripleton|pg||

nt|jcwla: Big slam time.|pg||
nt|shevek: 1. USA-BLUE  86; 2. NETHERLANDS ORANGE  81; 3. ITALY RED  80; 4.EGYPT  75|pg||
nt|shevek: sry abt capitals (copy & paste)|pg||
nt|lestergold: delarer should have tackled hearts leaving two trumps in dummy to cater for the entries needed in the event that hearts broke 4/2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I would think the other way|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 4@H a make |pg||
nt|haans: 4@S only 1 down|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w seem to be aggressive - might get to 4@H here|pg||
nt|onebid: Scotland really couldn't find a winning action to compensate for -150 in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  flushed with success from the previous hand, no doubt|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|rnmalik: interesting board-fighting 3NT for EW|pg||
nt|buffytvs: The 9 IMPs came from Bd 11 -- this room stopped in 3@H while Kevin Fay madae 4@H dbled at the other table|pg||
nt|jcwla: South did double 2@D in the OR, but West persisted with 3@D and made it for a push on 23.|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|haans: spades 5-1 against|pg||
nt|lestergold: interesting bity of a misfit here but as cards lie e/w can make3n|pg||
nt|iris100:  EW are in 3SA in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 5@C 2 down|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|rnmalik: would EW bid 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: do not think they go that far|pg||
nt|cherdano:  3@D will make it harder|pg||
nt|cherdano:  but as North just needs a spade control and keycards to bid slam|pg||
nt|peachy: lots of young bridge talent in netherlands, I understand, they have 4 (or 5?) teams in turkey|pg||
nt|jcwla: Whether the N/S @D fit is 8 or 9, E always has the rest.|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: there is 5 netherlands team here|pg||
nt|lestergold: dreadful contract of course|pg||
nt|onebid: On many auctions I would agree, but with nothing to contribute, pass seems logical|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes the sac would have been cool|pg||
nt|haans: acceptable|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|haans: but good spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 1 other table N-S +110   1@S  making 2 for +5 IMps Team  42|pg||

nt|Walddk4: You play Precision, Liz, please explain 1NT. Did the reverse 1@S and 1NT?|pg||
nt|onebid: Oh dear - I guess I can;'t comment on my choice of opening. Roland still here? lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 3 is in from the OR: 5 more to Neth. Orange after 2@S-P-3@S-swish, making.   E/W never peeped.|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharynr: that should fail as well|pg||

nt|shevek: 3   GREECOURA   93|pg||
nt|onebid: OK:(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: duck and give 2@H to make|pg||
nt|onebid: Not responding 1@S caused the lead to come from East|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 1@H looks fine to me but I fear they may have wrongsided this|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lucky W aint have 3@D|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North must duck and hope he has been a good boy|pg||
nt|onebid: suits up the line sometimes better|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if so it would be always down after this lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i mean the 3@D|pg||
nt|onebid: still, no choice but to duck|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true|pg||
nt|paulg: They don't play "F" and they don't reverse 1@s/1NT, but often start game forcing hands with a forcing 1NT rather than bid naturally .. for some reason|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The trouble is that he might rely on the club finesse to work in order to get rid of a diamond loser. So there is a losing option|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|haans: bidding games on everything is not good bridge|pg||
nt|cherdano:  _she_ can count 13 tricks|pg||
nt|cherdano:  unless her partner has a doubleton club, that would be unlucky|pg||
nt|jcwla: That seems really contraindicated on this auction.|pg||
nt|shevek: 4   EGYPT   91|pg||
nt|shevek: 4.    NETHERLANDS RED   91|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: many double nowdays saying nothing about minors|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcwla: WD.|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has only one lay for this contract and he will no doubt roll it in with a PHEW because if tehn diamonds dont behave the contract is going down loads|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or he may try to duck hearts into East to protect @DJ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or not :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: His decision is brilliant|pg||
nt|onebid: Hi Paul@H|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think he will take Roland line|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not any more|pg||
nt|onebid: I think the Liz|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: sorry misscounted E hand :(|pg||
nt|lestergold: hold ur breath finesse and steal the imps my son!!|pg||
nt|shevek: will he take the @d finesse to make the contract?|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has no sane alternative choice|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Very tough. South was declarer in the other room with a spade lead - not so difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: norwegan GF 2nt|pg||
nt|rnmalik: vital entry to W for @H finesse|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this bid doesn't excite South|pg||

mb|p|nt|iris100:  depends on the lead|pg||
nt|sharynr: are any explanations being given operator|pg||

pc|d9|nt|onebid: but what do I know:(|pg||
nt|iris100:  she doesnt even need the heart finesse|pg||

nt|haans: loosers 1@H 2@D 1@S|pg||
nt|cherdano:  as predicted South didn't get excited by the 4@S bid|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i believe South already upgraded his hand to a 17-19 balanced|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: He should not have listened to me|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i sympathise with N line anyway |pg||
pc|h6|pc|c4|nt|haans: why finessing spades|pg||
nt|iris100:  4@H was better than 4@S on board 2|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course he hates it if its wrong then  dummy's diamonds destined for the scrap yard|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|onebid: seems a pure guess|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The club switch theatens his trump control makes it very tough|pg||
nt|sharynr: best lead, but will block when Norths entry is taken out|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|iris100:  W needs to guess the @D position anyway|pg||
nt|sharynr: true|pg||
nt|jcwla: The lead likely gives it away.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jaapfr: a very unhappy 4 boards for scots to start with|pg||
nt|iris100:  depends if they play a convention for leads of the 9|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: now its n/s who hate it they know theyv e been robbed blind|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sharynr: but a smooth duck of the @S would have left declarer a guess|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|cherdano:  with 3 aces and trump queen he was worth cooperating over 3@S|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|cherdano:  but not more than that|pg||

mb|3H|nt|sybarra: handy on this hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  @D lead looks normal with the South hand?|pg||
nt|cherdano:  natural i assume|pg||
nt|haans: but 3nt is better|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt very hard to find|pg||
nt|roswolf: the lady fixes the contract but perhaps science needed to be used|pg||
nt|haans: would you have bid 3nt?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|cherdano:  @C also possible|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yecch.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: USA Blue in a league of their own it seems|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Dbl is probably some fancy defence to the strong club - maybe a 1-suiter?|pg||
nt|paulg: Precision 1@c, pass is 0-4(5)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|haans: first Bulletin can now be read on http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Bulletins.htm|pg||
nt|haans: sort of insult not supporting p|pg||
nt|onebid: 5-3-3-2 not a one suiter in many systems, lol|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: so far each board has swung 9 IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: strong club, Precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: When you just have to find a bid of some kind.....|pg||
nt|onebid: especially at these colors|pg||
nt|onebid: declarer won't find the diamond pitches with no dummy entry|pg||
nt|cindy:  anyone bid 3@h over 2@d ?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: well pard bid 1nt and north has a lot of soft values - yes i think 3nt has merit|pg||
nt|haans: yes but would you?|pg||
nt|roswolf: but may have been able to offer a choice of games|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes i would|pg||
nt|haans: ok |pg||
nt|jcwla: me|pg||
nt|iris100:  lucky escape by both EWs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: only if breathing|pg||
nt|sharynr: West will shake his head when dummy hits, but smile at trump pulling time|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cuttysark: South has a real problem. best to stay passive with a red suit, but hard for him to see that|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cherdano:  i predict this board will swing less :)|pg||
nt|cherdano:  if 1@S was natural the lead could have worked very well|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|cherdano:  tempting declarer to duck twice with Kxxx in dummy|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|s3|nt|haans: easiest way to find @HJ|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jcwla: "Come back, pard, all is forgiven."|pg||
nt|cindy:  now the smiling|pg||
nt|iris100:  one more IMP to Italy|pg||
nt|sharynr: i like 3-level jump in first suit to show at most 1 loser after a 2 over 1. So yes 3@H very reasonable|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: yes he s|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: is|pg||
nt|marlowepi: standard is solid suit|pg||
nt|cindy:  probably expecting more than 1 imp on the hand|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Information.htm  for the tournament website. Better link than the one before|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s4|nt|iris100:  they donÂ´t know Kautny/HÃ¶pfler|pg||
nt|cindy:  ive played both ways   solid suit and no more than one loser|pg||
nt|cindy:  depending on what my partner likes |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|shevek: same contract in OR, flat board|pg||
nt|onebid: now club|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1 imp still winning by going down 1|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|haans: 3nt is not much better than 4@H only need one trick less|pg||
nt|haans: and that is better :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|shevek: Total Entries for the KO Teams: 34 teams, with 155 players from 26 countries|pg||
pc|h8|nt|cherdano:  we dont have result from round 1|pg||
pc|d3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|onebid: never mind - didn't see ace cashed:(|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|peachy: West counting hands, I can hear it :)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|cherdano:  as it was it cost an overtrick|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|s7|nt|cherdano:  USA blue won their first match 25-0|pg||

nt|nicksan: Beating 3 NT on board 14 was worth another 10 IMP's for the Italians.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|jcmax: Another slam deal now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so how do we rate 7@H now?|pg||
nt|nicksan: Speaking of grand slams...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: surely better than 70% this time round|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|d|nt|jcmax: This time it makes, so it must be a good slam :)|pg||
nt|nicksan: This one being huge...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bart is working overtime, we'll award a 100% pay raise next month|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bbramley: if hearts not 4-0 virtually cold, and with 4-0 hearts still lots of play - well over 90%|pg||
nt|jcmax: How ould you play it though?|pg||
nt|nicksan: Now, Hopfler will have an idea about partners void...|pg||
mb|4N|nt|jcmax: I wonder whether dbl was 3cd support or a good hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Whuch lead do you give it, Sabine?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which even|pg||
nt|Walddk2: trump?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|jcmax: that seems like the most likely lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|nicksan: How do you ask for a spade void here? |pg||
mb|6H|nt|bbramley: on trump vs 7: win cheap, @S ruff, @CA, @S ruff, @C ruff with @H9 - phew!|pg||
nt|jcmax: Strange that EW apparently have no method of showing a void over Blackwood. Or maybe W didn't want to risk it|pg||
nt|bbramley: this is not easy to reach even if west does show the void - east can hardly count 13|pg||
mb|p|mb|7H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: wow|pg||
nt|nicksan: West was holding a void and considerable extras...|pg||
nt|jcmax: Well, does it not depend a little on what W's dbl showed? If it showed extra values E might have a chance|pg||
nt|bbramley: so if east had passed 5@H, could west then bid 6@H?|pg||
nt|nicksan: About 1700 in 7 @S...|pg||
nt|jcmax: strange bidding.....|pg||
nt|bbramley: saving on THIS auction would be crazy - opponents might off an ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West wasn't really invited to the party, was he?|pg||
nt|nicksan: Faint heart never kissed...|pg||
mb|7S|nt|iris100:  7@H in the other room|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: Now W wishes he could lead a trump :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Maybe he can escape for 1400|pg||
nt|Walddk2: club now to open the communications|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|bbramley: on the auction he knows the trump position|pg||

nt|roswolf: hmm trap hand now|pg||
mb|1D|nt|cherdano:  this may be a swing to france, as East can hardly make 1N on a @D lead|pg||
nt|haans: look at E diamonds|pg||
nt|haans: is that fair|pg||
nt|roswolf: impressive - no!?:)|pg||
nt|iris100:  grand slam time|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: sad to have ths S hand at favorable and be stuck in 4th chair :(|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzur: sory for inconvenience some technical problem here|pg||
nt|shevek: I hope 2@c is not for the Majors !|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now a Scottish chance here: to make 2@S C|pg||
nt|iris100:  still can do some damage|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|haans: 4@S just about|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@d looks like a pass/ correct bid|pg||
nt|shevek: south would like to dbl as a tko of @d....|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes  i like 3@s|pg||
nt|iris100:  good dieter!|pg||
nt|cindy:  is 4@h auto ?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cherdano:  NS open very light as you can see - playing strong club helps for that|pg||
nt|jcwla: Both pairs made ten tricks in @H's so a push on 25.|pg||
mb|5C|nt|marlowepi: W has a really hard bid over 3S|pg||
nt|cindy:  i agree, marshall|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: maybe 2@c was 1-suited hand|pg||
mb|5D|nt|buffytvs: potential trouble here though...|pg||
nt|cherdano:  this looks like 9 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: can get really dirty|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: 2@C was Majors|pg||
nt|shevek: well....|pg||
nt|shevek: hard to describe that hand as Majors|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It may take a heart lead to make it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but 4H is the best non-unilateral bid to get pd excited. now 5N is easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: @DT awful|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Gyles Ellison led @D10 in the other room, as did West here now|pg||
nt|onebid: not a fan of doubleton leads, but......|pg||
nt|jaapfr: for declarer :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: are we not obliged to favor the team trailing by 30-1?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I cannot endorse a lead from 10x, even when it works!|pg||
mb|6C|nt|sybarra: has to be a bit careful.  might bring it home|pg||
nt|haans: i would prefer a clubs finesse|pg||
nt|cherdano:  East maybe double this for penalties?|pg||
nt|cherdano:  no he did not|pg||
nt|buffytvs: doubt that dbl would be for penalties|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is defeatable|pg||
nt|haans: how forcing is 4@D?|pg||
nt|cindy:  the 4@s bid by N sort of hurt their chances on keeping them out of slam|pg||
nt|iris100:  E doesnÂ´t know abot the @S void|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 5N was obvious to me unless 5C could have been a singleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  nor is it clear that a penalty double would be a success|pg||
mb|6D|nt|jcwla: Ruff a @D and lose 2@S, 1@H, 1@D.|pg||
nt|jcwla: On Board 4, where N/S here went down 3 in 3NT, the OR N/S bid all the way up to 6@D, which was doubled and down one.  3 more to Neth. Orange.|pg||
nt|roswolf: gf i should hope|pg||
nt|haans: but what should S bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D seems to be the spot they are heading for|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: @SQ would have been more effective here than the last hand  :)|pg||
nt|cindy:  he really wouldnt know if N hand passed but not sure that is realistic|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree--4S was worse than a waste of time|pg||
mb|7H|nt|haans: right :)|pg||
nt|haans: please no more clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello|pg||
nt|roswolf: south can pass this but should he|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  it would make for a nice first trick|pg||
nt|cherdano:  but you still have to play to trick two :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: double is growing|pg||
nt|haans: S bid nt so NT down 2|pg||
nt|jcwla: OR sac'd in 7@S over 7@H.|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|haans: need thinking|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S does not even take keycard away from opps|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes|pg||
nt|sharynr: he gambled on 1st round @s ctrl|pg||
nt|iris100:  and won|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cherdano:  it seems like this will be down 1|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: north is thinking of bidding 6 - she shouldnt since she has shown her hand already|pg||
nt|roswolf: east is a wimp|pg||
nt|haans: she was in slamming mode from the start we all been there|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|onebid: with me, it's almost a pre-alert - she almost never leads one|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|cindy:  not too much of a gamble|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it was barely a gamble at all with N providing so much gratuitous information |pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: with a little help|pg||
nt|haans: i have looked for 42 but found nothing|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|jcwla: N/S have had more of the hands here than in a bridge column.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|onebid: hmmm|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: @DA was a good help|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Bd 14 swung 12 IMps, not 9 :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|cherdano:  on a penalty double and the same lead|pg||
nt|haans: still looks like a make|pg||
nt|shevek: play the J for 3 imps in?|pg||
nt|shevek: or the 9 for another flat board?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|s9|nt|cherdano:  North may just take his 4 top tricks and two club ruffs for seven tricks|pg||
nt|buffytvs: where NS here stopped in 5@H, the French stopped to double EW in 2@S and picked up 1100|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sharynr: what? you never raised pard preeempts on less than 3 card support!?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|jaapfr: only if trump A and expectation to find pd again the  Tx looks more attractive than usual |pg||
nt|onebid: this defense has stumbled though|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5 IMPs to Scotland it seems. The defence wasn't the best I think it's fair to say|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|roswolf: -2 at least|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and sometimes they lead a trump, trusting you|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s3|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 3NT is the winner here, 4@S is not. Can they do it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: Even 4H would be better than 4S because of the good intermediates in the @H suit|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|jcmax: I don't see a sensinle way to get to 3NT unless W doesn't show his 5cd suit at all|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jcmax: Some people believe in just always bidding 3NT with a balanced hand. They would be right here.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hopfler might pass with all his slow values in the read suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: i look for a strong doubleton if i do it, especially Qx|pg||

nt|jcmax: break|pg||
nt|nicksan: E/W CR must have been delighted to stop in 2 @S, but...|pg||

nt|haans: always from 2 honors first always|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is routine|pg||
nt|haans: 3@S?|pg||
nt|haans: votes for 4@S|pg||
nt|shevek: easy 4@h or 4@s here, probably another square board|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I don't see 9 tricks - not that I'm complaining, you understand|pg||
nt|cindy:  seems to me leading a @s is a big waste of time too|pg||
nt|jcwla: 7@SX is looking like 1400 in the OR, so 13 more to Italy Red.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: He had them in the end. Diamond up after drawing trumps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for W not to be void, 3S has to be on a 6-card suit & 4S had to be a doubleton. it can happen, but it is a pretty small parlay. thus the word "barely"|pg||
mb|1H|nt|haans: 42 are very young |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Jacob and Hans |pg||
nt|cherdano:  another automatic opener for NS|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this hand may be stretching light openings too far|pg||
nt|cherdano:  playing a strong club i don't see any problems with opening balanced 10 counts|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S is soon slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4s is not quite as easy|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|sybarra: we now have the rooms connected :)  wd |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 club?|pg||
nt|cherdano:  3@C probably shows both minors|pg||
nt|buffytvs: when the suit you open is dbleton KJ? an aceless 8-loser wonder?|pg||
nt|cherdano:  getting to 3N looks more normal|pg||
nt|shevek: true|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tell me how you find 11 tricks here:)|pg||
nt|onebid: for heart pitch|pg||
nt|iris100:  not if youÂ´ve got the @SA to cash ;-)|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: its the first day in school|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I was searching, but in vain|pg||
mb|p|nt|onebid: it's 11 hcp and 1@D doesn't guarantee diamonds|pg||
nt|cherdano:  well it doesnt show diamonds, it shows a balanced 10-13|pg||
nt|haans: well done here|pg||
nt|sharynr: kib made good point though, 6@c denies spade ace, so 6@D should not be bid without|pg||
mb|2D|nt|haans: in my book 4@C is cue |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: got that right|pg||
nt|cherdano:  here the opening propel EW too high|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no, I think EW did that to themselves|pg||
nt|cherdano:  of course, it would have been NW who are too high if East had made a penalty pass|pg||
nt|cherdano:  but with KQx of trumps, that wasnt so easy to find|pg||
nt|buffytvs: wasn't 3@C a diamond raise?|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i _think_ it shows both minors|pg||
nt|harmon: probably fit showing cause Justin always throws fits anyway|pg||
nt|cherdano:  Matt Meckstroth confirms, 3@C shows both minors, less than invite|pg||
nt|lestergold: can lose two spade tricks a heart and a diamond in 4s whereas no probs in 4H|pg||
nt|shevek: declarer would have to guess @s|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think 3@C is 5-card Stayman|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Is 3@C a modern variation of Stayman?|pg||
nt|cindy:  im not a big fan of this double|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  successful lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: i wouls bid 4@S as north and pard would pass !|pg||
nt|onebid: puppet likely|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Liz answered the question|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i see a @C a@D and a @H as minimum for defense here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well, there goes the club?|pg||
mb|d|nt|cherdano:  if declarer ducks to West's king, West can shift to the @CT|pg||
nt|lestergold: however it lookslike they will p-lay this in the sounder 4/4 fit rather than the 6/2 fit|pg||
nt|iris100:  getting desperate|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: good pass by N-makeable +1|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rnmalik: @CA and another|pg||
nt|haans: not right if clubs 3-1|pg||
nt|harmon: Meckstroth?? that name sounds familiar|pg||
nt|jcwla: 5 to Scotland on Board 5.  They went down 1 in 2NT here while Neth. went down 3 in 3NT in the OR.|pg||
nt|onebid: at least he didn't lead doubleton diamond:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  true Harmon :)|pg||

pc|c9|pc|cJ|nt|jcwla: Surprisingly quiet E/W bidding here -- will serve them well.|pg||

nt|lestergold: my|pg||

nt|cherdano:  this seems down 3 now|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S may be big winner|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: little break here|pg||
nt|haans: how many of you had ever bid 4@C after 3@S because you want to play clubs? not many im sure|pg||

nt|cindy:  just asking because it looks like 1N to me|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cherdano:  here declarer could have blocked the suit by ducking @C9|pg||
pc|d5|nt|haans: still a make|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i suppose West meant redouble as SOS, or doubt-showing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I hope you guys are never dealt doubletons|pg||
nt|Walddk4: do you always have 4333?|pg||

nt|onebid: LOLOL|pg||
nt|jaapfr: girls or guys:)?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|shevek: at the other table declarer played @hA, then small to Q which is the correct play to lose 1 trick|pg||

pc|d3|nt|yvonnebrid: yes, it is marion|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cherdano:  West did well to keep the club layout unclare with the @C9 continuation|pg||
nt|lestergold: marion will be disappointed with that finesse another diamond is quite a threatening defence|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|harmon: he wanted to get to the 4 level??|pg||
mc|8|nt|cherdano:  the @H shift destroyed NS' communication|pg||
nt|buffytvs: East probably had doubts too, but nowhere to run either|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i like 1NT also at these colors, because of the trip spade. if your auction goes 1H-1S, you are poorly placed on the second round. but with 5 spades you will always find spades by ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: opening 1N|pg||

nt|peachy: i would be tempted but prob not|pg||
nt|peachy: particularly opposing Precision players|pg||
nt|peachy: 4H could have been many types of hands|pg||
nt|roswolf: it should be a relay cue in that you ask opener to cue bid singletons or voids and is forcing to 5 of the trump suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The closed room result now is a score you should never see at IMPs, but you do, sadly|pg||
nt|onebid: action!|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: e/w nt range is 15-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Better @C play by Lall in other room but chose to work on @H's rather than @S's and ended up the same down two for another push.|pg||
nt|haans: a passibility|pg||
nt|onebid: West had awkward decision over 2@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you could miss hearts, true, but then maybe deal belongs to opps|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|cherdano:  1@C = 16+|pg||

nt|cuttysark: The old weak 2-suited two opener does not seem to have reached Junior Scotland yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  1@H = 8-11 |pg||
nt|onebid: Perhaps should have opened the bidding?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: double is very dangerous. I would have preferred 2NT, two places to play, if I re-open|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still as E after p-2@S-p-p-X-p-?? what to do then Roland??|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|cherdano:  (i assume)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Read above|pg||
nt|ritong: ellison bros bid conservatively|pg||
nt|cuttysark: That would solve his problem. Why not? Good suits, easy rebid...|pg||
nt|onebid: Yes, Roland has the answer !|pg||
nt|ritong: they stayed backline all set long|pg||
nt|jaapfr: agree but when pd X as E i do pass as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I also agree that the double is not good - spade void makes it likely partner will pass|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|bigtrain: u r correct |pg||
nt|roswolf: double is cute here|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 42 taking the lead|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|cherdano:  now if East keycards|pg||
nt|cherdano:  West can show his hand completely|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|haans: often invite to game in spades|pg||
nt|onebid: you certainly will pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N!|nt|cherdano:  West opts for a stopperless 1N bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2d by unpassed hand should be forcing in imps game|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  rather than 2@H with a flat hand and a 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: W beat him to keycard|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|cherdano:  not clear what the best line for declarer is|pg||
nt|lml: hi there|pg||
nt|harmon: uh oh Linda is here|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: moral support :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: it was here it seems|pg||
nt|haans: they did that right|pg||
mb|4H|nt|shevek: it was at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  i see 4@S was keycard|pg||
nt|cherdano:  knowing they are limited to 32 hcp, West doesn't try for grand - will be disappointed to find perfect cards with East|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6 a push at 3NT-2.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: but the have a lot to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Same contract in OR -- hard to find out about the 5 @D tricks -- yet another push.|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: meckstroth says 'sorry my fault'|pg||
nt|sharynr: no success expected here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow what does 2C then 2N show?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|iris100:  would you open the W hand with 2@C|pg||
nt|sharynr: this is the 2nd auction where they did that. must be 18-20|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i gues sit depends what 2C then 2N shows|pg||
nt|sharynr: see bd 14...|pg||
nt|iris100:  good save against 4@D by NS|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: this seems like an overly cheerful auction|pg||
nt|buffytvs: exuberant I would say|pg||
nt|cherdano:  2N by East would have been enough|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think once West responded East was never letting him out|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i guess some would suggest that West should pass with 5 hcp, but since I know I would bid 1@H i won't criticize him for bidding :)|pg||
nt|lml: well 2NT is the book bid|pg||
nt|lml: yes he has aces but he is 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|lml: +1 and -1|pg||
nt|cuttysark: At least North did not lead his 10x|pg||
nt|jaapfr: traumatic:)?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, there is no damage control when you have to match 470|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|cherdano:  4333 and 3 jacks|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|haans: cross ruff|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rnmalik: @C shif would have created some problems|pg||
nt|onebid: you have to have sympathy for this NS - they don't get to play 2@SX|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lml: but then add a point or two for youth|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: altho 3n did go off in open room- its not an unreasonable contract to reach combined 24 with two 5 card suits and fair inmtermedoates all suits stopped|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And it is hard to see a good defence to this heart contract|pg||
nt|jaapfr: here the muiderberg 2 openings did work in both rooms|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|sharynr: without this 2@C opening, it may start 1@H DBL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: love it when one player opens 2C and their side bid smoothly to game against silent opps, and hand belongs to opps :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|jcwla: 7 to Austria for bidding and making 3NT on 17.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|haans: @H lead to J and then after entry with @SK kill |pg||
nt|onebid: Still, opening 1@H best describes your hand if that isn't available|pg||
nt|jaapfr: polish=muiderberg in this respect tx paul:)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|harmon: does better by going after hts|pg||
nt|lml: I think he was hoping that the C!K was onside and the H!K|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|buffytvs: scoring average has gone down -- only 8 IMPs per board now|pg||
nt|lestergold: im sure south intended her bid as forcing partnership needs to sort out this area|pg||
nt|cindy:  lol|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lml: @CK and @HK|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i would have played a club to the king at trick 2|pg||
nt|haans: OR same bidding but only 3@S|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|lml: he could make his diamond|pg||
pc|h6|nt|shevek: 3NT should've made, declarer didn't play it very well|pg||
nt|lestergold: played by south tio protect the clubs 3N has a good chance of coming home|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: odd that W did not pull 3 trumps before leading D (or whatever)|pg||
nt|sharynr: When I was very young, (a billion years ago) I opened 2NT with a complete yarborough... and EVERYONE passed!|pg||
mc|7|nt|lml: too and maybe even four hearts|pg||
nt|cindy:  3N worked out great|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: a non vul 2 suiter |pg||

nt|rnmalik: 3@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: in NL  they call it Muiderberg |pg||
nt|cherdano:  still West can confirm keycards|pg||
nt|jcwla: 7 a push at 4@H making.  OR North opted to use Jacoby 2NT and South rebid 4@H.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|haans: with that weak hand?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think Verbeek is looking for some action here  |pg||
nt|bigtrain: normal precision it's easier...  E makes a @D positive then W can visualize grand|pg||
nt|cherdano:  confirm having all keycards, and sometimes East can just bid 7 on a spade or club trick source|pg||
nt|cherdano:  2@D showing a good heart raise|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some play that bidding 6 says a keycard is missing.|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s need to play this in 3N north may worry about diamonds but probably best just to punt it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: u can do that in canada. here trhey bust your kneecaps, this is america|pg||
nt|cindy:  hqhq|pg||
nt|jcwla: Light opener here...|pg||
nt|iris100:  3rd seat|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: or maybe it is just a 5 card (very) wk 2 |pg||
nt|haans: 3@H better than normal with @H|pg||
nt|lml: now vulnerable and with a 6 card suit this time I bid lots|pg||
nt|cherdano:  and this time it would be successful, too|pg||
nt|lml: yes :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: This looks like Puppet.|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh i feared this|pg||
nt|lestergold: now soutgh will think north is worried about spades|pg||
nt|shevek: they seem to be having a conversation...|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@s by south?|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u if 3n means i havent got spades but have got diamodns then all will be ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5c can make of course as cards lie|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 3n much more comfortable|pg||
nt|shevek: obviously north failed to bid 3NT because he thinks slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: the ten of dimaonds is the key card and its favourable|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, W had a light opener but passed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N just showed he was breathing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: do you agree to such opening when P is not a passed hand|pg||
nt|cherdano:  so 2@D promised 3 hearts and 8+ points to be precise|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it depends on the meaning of the 3c raise- in modern stykle its unusually weakish|pg||
nt|iris100:  would not open the W hand red in second position |pg||

pc|d3|pg||
nt|cherdano:  what did this double show?|pg||
nt|haans: tricky to make|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S much better|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|haans: playing with weak hands trumf|pg||
nt|roswolf: easier to go off than to make i think|pg||
nt|haans: W did open weak "@S in OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3s was kit telling or asking it wasnt fourth suit!|pg||
nt|shevek: it was right there in the bidding box :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: well this lead will not hurt|pg||
nt|ritong: right R  only a backwards finesse maniac can fail here|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: remember that old joke about my nose runs and my feet smell|pg||
nt|cherdano:  East has a nice stopper and a 6-card suit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: if matt has similar agreements to his dad...  2@D shows exactly 3@H and about 6-9 dummy points|pg||
nt|jcwla: OR is also playing 3@S.|pg||
nt|cherdano:  North bid 3@S in the other room instead of 2@S|pg||
nt|jcwla: Perfect Snapdragon double here for W.|pg||
nt|cindy:  yep|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cherdano:  2@S doesnt look like enough to me either|pg||
nt|roswolf: playing to ruff a club should work|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lml: he is upside down|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: so snapdragon promises 5?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: and now only on a @D finesse|pg||
nt|haans: even without dutch 4@S are easy to find|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|haans: i call it dutch shotrre that M...|pg||

pc|c2|nt|haans: throw in also called nedplay possoble|pg||
nt|haans: endplay|pg||
nt|bigtrain: N does have alot of losers and knows his patrtner is somewhat limited|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|cherdano:  2NT might be down too|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bigtrain: personally i think 2@S is about right|pg||
nt|jcwla: Ditto.|pg||
nt|cherdano:  limited due to the opponents' bidding?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes|pg||
nt|jcwla: I know some people play 4+ @H's on this auction but most play five.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|cT|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: beside it is a VUL game|pg||
nt|lml: you should bid it if it sniffs at you|pg||
nt|bigtrain: and more than half his values won't contribute to offense|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: easy|pg||
nt|lml: the one he bid was a NV game|pg||
nt|cherdano:  but i think game will be good opposite many minimum takeout doubles with 4 spades|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk4: If any declarer really played for the heart suit to be dealt  Qxx    10   by advancing the jack, he might be accused of having the hand records|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|cherdano:  @SATxx and AK in one minor - ok these are perfect cards maybe|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or needing to visit a therapist|pg||
nt|ritong: and also to have forgotten to play K first|pg||
pc|c9|pc|sJ|nt|bigtrain: bidding game on hands like this will more likely lose 6 IMPs than win 10|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes if it promises 5 then it is best. otherwise 2H|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|jcwla: All of S's choices have worked out as poorly as possible.|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Finally, our appreciation to the WBF and TBF for ensuring that this wonderful inaugural event is brought to BBO vugraph. Murat Molva, Ata Aydin and Cengiz Arigun have been ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: instrumental in setting up a fine show|pg||
nt|jcmax: After W opened the bidding I really wouldn't want to be in slam. Wouldn't expect the @DK to be onside|pg||
nt|nicksan: At this rate, they'll do well to reach game!|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcmax: INteresting that S did not show a 2-suiter immediately|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nicksan: That was 800 for a minute...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Di Franco is worth more than 2@S I think, but what?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|nicksan: 2 NT or pass IMO|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And Sabine was virtually spot on. The Austrians did come back!|pg||
nt|nicksan: more Austrian IMP's ...|pg||
nt|bbramley: and a driving finish for austria - with 660 from the Closed they will win another 10 or so here to make the margin respectable|pg||
nt|jcmax: It is of course important for every good partnership how to show a 2-suiter in this situation. Most experts would play a 2@H bid as natural here. and some also play 2@C as natural ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: at least if 1@C can be short. So if 1NT also would be natural, that would leave only 2NT for the 2-suiter|pg||
nt|bbramley: and double|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, double and then get excited later .)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: then|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bbramley: 3NT is a good contract here, but very hard to evaluate with only 23 HCP and no big fit - the red-suit spots are working hard|pg||
mc|12|nt|Walddk2: Thanks all and bye for now|pg||

nt|vugraphzur: this is last board of the day 4th RR will start 10 am local time tommorow |pg||
nt|marlowepi: a spec just sent me the wikipedia article on Snpdragon, which says that it shows usually SIX cards, but can be stretched to 5. does wikipedia play for money?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: another slam?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Hans and Rashed for comments and insights,  we appreciate your time |pg||
nt|lml: the dreaded multi|pg||
nt|jcwla: As we approach the end of this match, a big thank you to our excellent vugraph operator, to Roland Wald, to Walter Johnson, to Arend Bayer, and to all specs.|pg||
nt|onebid: now there's a result!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last board of the match now. Many thanks again to Ozgur Kanli, our very capable operator in Istanbul. Well done!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: what a lucky  3nt with 6 tricks for defense\|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Also thanks to my excellent fellow commentators: Liz McGowan, Judy Bramley and Jaap Frijling|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we have had 3 I think in this session|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also to the organizers for bringing us the Youth Congress,   we will be busy on bbo for many days |pg||
nt|vugraphzur: see you @@ 16:00 o'clock at local time 35 minutes later|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks Shirley, Haans and our operator. It ia a pleasure.|pg||
nt|lml: when I was playing a few days ago at a tournament in North American I practically got booed for playing it|pg||
nt|peachy: this will be another likely push at 3n|pg||
nt|lestergold: we see that e/w in open reached a very junior 3N|pg||
nt|lestergold: absurd really because the spade lead was guaranteed|pg||
nt|shevek: well, it worked in bd 24 :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2d is atrociopus|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: this is the last board of this round RR7 will start about half hour later|pg||
nt|shevek: they're young Mike|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Finally, our appreciation to the WBF and TBF for ensuring that this wonderful inaugural event is brought to BBO vugraph. Murat Molva, Ata Aydin and Cengiz Arigun have been ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: instrumental in setting up a fine show for the whole world to watch. Much appreciated!|pg||
nt|onebid: and also thanks to Paul for giving us info on system|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sounds like a hacker attack.|pg||
nt|cindy:  ive never heard of it showing six|pg||
nt|iris100:  slam on the last board - not a very good one though|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: a weak 2 with two ks outside but nothing in ur suit is not my idea of sound bridge especially in second piosition|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: ur bids should always be sound in 2nd of course|pg||
nt|shevek: born after 1 January 1984 (Under-26 category)|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: the last round of the day will start in 45 mins later|pg||
nt|paulg: I'm not sure I'd give a positive on that club suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W passed another light opener :)|pg||
mb|r|nt|jcwla: My partners always bid @D's when I make this kind of double.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: I am sorry,  I must dash to an appointment,  I will see you later :)  |pg||
nt|iris100:  chicken!|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: n/s are young but have played internationlly for some time |pg||
nt|sybarra: S on the NL ladies team |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: slam here is to much|pg||
nt|haans: trust no spade lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Thank you everybody - enjoy the rest of this event|pg||
nt|jaapfr: all kibs rite about x @H lead making 3nt by N and the potential blocking|pg||
nt|onebid: Indeed, and good group here. Thanks|pg||
nt|sharynr: mine too Jordan|pg||
nt|sharynr: but what can you do|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, as we approach the end of this match, a big thank you to Roland Wald, to our excellent vugraph operator, and to Sharyn, Cindy, Iris, and Marshall and to all specs.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cherdano:  now this time East is taking the aggressive route!|pg||
nt|lml: it is allowed in unlimited events at major tournaments if there are at least 6 boards per round|pg||
nt|cherdano:  and to you, Jordan|pg||
nt|shevek: looks like 5 imps to Greecoura to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: even then but no @C finesse|pg||
nt|haans: easy make if you see all cards|pg||
nt|rnmalik: again:)|pg||
nt|haans: smirny say 'its cold sp on D' na dright that is|pg||
nt|cherdano:  3@D shows spades, probably with a maximum|pg||
nt|lml: I was told I played it to confuse the opponents who would find it sooo hard to play against|pg||
nt|onebid: no longer matters:(|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The heart suit could easily be blocked against 3NT, but what does it matter when West has a trick in spades|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and what would we do with E in other room when he would lead @HAK2:)?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I agree that North should bid 1NT (or possibly 1@S if they are reversing things)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Excellent case for 3rd leads|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @H6 lead would unblock the suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Someone has asked me to explain the bidding. Would that I could|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It's a strong club, positive response, then it loses me a little|pg||
nt|onebid: seems that N thought 3@D was natural and South is cue bidding|pg||
nt|jaapfr: most of the 10 boards the Scotch were ""ünhappy"" imo|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So popular opinion has it that 3@C is a trump ask, 3@D denies a top honour|pg||
nt|paulg: 3@c is trump asking, 3@d says I have rubbish trumps, 4@d is cue|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In theory, the Scots are doing the right thing here, avoiding 3NT. The trouble is that no other game makes either|pg||
nt|onebid: Ah - Thx Paul|pg||
nt|paulg: as North is unlimited at this point|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not wishing to cause trouble, but we are Scots (Scotch is whisky)|pg||
nt|paulg: North will be looking for a forcing 3@c bid in the box now|pg||
nt|onebid: and very good whiskey:)|pg||
nt|onebid: But Paul, why would S need to ask about club quality?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a kib does not forgive W in other room for not bidding 3@H:)|pg||
nt|paulg: because they play a very simple system and it is how they show support|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the solution, jordan, is to make all diamond bids artificial :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: and right that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: director warned the players last 2 min|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep double swing here|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, Marion is an experienced player|pg||
nt|ritong: was a weird decision, admittedly|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6 more to Austria on 19 -- they set 2@S three tricks after 2@S by S, swish.  Late charge to keep the score respectable.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cherdano:  evil Linda, evil!|pg||
nt|cindy:  thx all :)|pg||
nt|iris100:  that was really needed after that start!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cherdano:  :)|pg||
nt|shevek: but maybe you should change your tactics when you play in a youth field?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcwla: Well, as we approach the end of this match, a big thank you to Roland Wald, to our excellent vugraph operator, to Raija Davis and to all specs.  Coverage continues throughout the ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: day here on BBO.|pg||
nt|sybarra: one of the young pair on the dutch ladies team |pg||
nt|ritong: told you, they stood backline all set long|pg||
nt|onebid: I apologize for mis-spelling whisky:(|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|paulg: i guess 4@d may be keycard, looking at the 4@s bid|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lml: even though I provided a choice of two written defenses they could read at the table|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Could be Kickback. North has o keycards - took him a while to count them|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now lead @SA and continue @S pls lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they would be doing better if there were a hand that required a Vienna coup|pg||
nt|sharynr: bye for today|pg||
nt|iris100:  no Vienna coups today|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks again to all and for now, from Los Angeles, so long.|pg||
nt|iris100:  thanks and bye all!|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rnmalik: asking for the @CQ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lml: during the auction|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|rnmalik: top 2 honours.|pg||
nt|shevek: we've seen, they like to bid a lot|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s5|pc|c2|nt|harmon: they couldnt read your writing|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|onebid: suit pref|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Nice jack, just in case|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|cherdano:  south of course has to ruff in low|pg||
nt|lestergold: but she needs to reconsider position before opening prempts in second piosition the odds increase hat your partne rhas a good hand nad that it may be ur hand so there is more to ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: lose by making an unsound bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting thought Nicoletta |pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|cherdano:  HedyG tells me usually in france, 3@D shows a minimum with spades|pg||
nt|cherdano:  if so, East would have been extremely aggressive|pg||
nt|lml: I play the same way|pg||
nt|lml: 3!M shows a good hand with that M|pg||
nt|cherdano:  note the @HT here, in case declarer has @HA9x|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|cherdano:  defense needs to force declarer|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: hi shirley where did u appear from?!?|pg||
