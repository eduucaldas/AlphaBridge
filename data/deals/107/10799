nt|Walddk4: tomorrow|pg||
nt|elbec: welcome to this semifinal between Italy and USA|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: E is one of the several good Drijver brothers:) Bob I think|pg||
nt|gulyas: OK, confirmed, its Bob|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@C either a multi of some sort, or a major 2 suiter (but my guess is, its a multi variation)|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@S was pass or correct|pg||
nt|chick: which means W may need to decide if 3@S could be a real suit|pg||
nt|gulyas: the double was just showing a good hand I would think, and I have no clue what 3@S would want to mean:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: OK, I am told that 2@C was in fact BOTH majors|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|gulyas: 5-4 and up|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|gulyas: hey Joe:)|pg||
nt|jstokes: will likely get to slam now; will make with a heart lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: 2 rounds,each rounds 14 boards|pg||
nt|gulyas: Italy Red beat France in an easy match, whereas USA Blue had to sweat it out and win by 1 IMP against Greece|pg||
nt|elbec: manno di franco play weak NT, with a "Nightmare" approach|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  this seems like the normal auction|pg||
nt|elbec: second section of semifinal between italy and usa|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: without a @S lead are 5 @C possible but 5@D bye NS are in|pg||
nt|april7: 6@C though is a good save by EW|pg||
nt|mdgraham: some might have bid 2@D over 1@H with the North hand - king to six not to be sneezed at |pg||
nt|santyclz: Re Daniel.|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Ozgur and Daniel|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello everyone, welcome to the second half of the QFs |pg||
nt|gulyas: which was a surprise since they won the prelims by a huge margin|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: H√ù ALL WELCOME|pg||
nt|elbec: this is going to be expensive for USA|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gulyas: USA Blue topped the field after 13 rounds, by a huge 46VP margin, so they are the hot favourites here|pg||
nt|garnetts: No reason for west not to lead a heart--|pg||
nt|garnetts: The contract is safe anyway|pg||
nt|gulyas: altho a @S lead would have been more testing|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: easy 3NT first up|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=10  for standings after 10 rounds. First 8 after 13 rounds advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: tomorrow|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS getting to 5@D now|pg||
nt|jstokes: East wondering if the @HK is worth anything (it is :))|pg||
nt|gulyas: hey Joe:)|pg||
nt|jstokes: Hi Daniel|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|gulyas: N will pull that|pg||
nt|gulyas: he does have a 6card support and a void after all:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: so then obv 3@S was SHOWING stop, since the opps have 2 suits|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello Andy, Ozgur|pg||
nt|andyv:  good contract|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cherdano:  North is 5-5 but has bad suits and the wrong shape to act over 2@H in the passout seat|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, well bid by NS|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gulyas: hmm|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The Curse of the Commentator strikes again|pg||
nt|don paulus: hi all|pg||
nt|elbec: hi paul|pg||
nt|don paulus: ciao :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|april7: and no defensive values at all and is vul. so a pullwould be obvious, but I also think the X was not the best bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: I agree with that too|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Joe :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: and hoping for 3NT with @H stop, but that all was messed up by S's 4@S bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=12  for standings after 12 rounds. Top 8 after this round advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: tomorrow|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Corielia.  |pg||
nt|chick: I don't know about "messed up", NS down at least a couple :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: it would be hard to read that it takes a @D lead to beat slam|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|gulyas: so currently, Italy Red are 5th, Australia 9th, both fighting for qualification|pg||
nt|gulyas: it is so good that it actually makes:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|jstokes: diamond lead will be successfull but seems impossible to find|pg||
nt|gulyas: with the lucky lie of cards (@Cs 3-3) the losing @D can be discarded|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|april7: rather 6@D than X i would suggest|pg||
nt|gulyas: a good convention here would have been the so called Polish double by N (showing an interest in some OTHER suit but the one he bid and got cued on)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gulyas: well, their well thought out defence was messed up:)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|gulyas: Greecoura is a Greek team, they finished 5th in the preliminaries|pg||
nt|andyv:  nothing to the play|pg||
nt|gulyas: I assume USA Blue picked them as opponents for the QF|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the USA team chose them for this round.|pg||
nt|rgdruru: hi|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|april7: but one should not be to greedy|pg||
nt|garnetts: well it would be more testing but will still make --provided declarer holds up and takes two finesses into east|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gulyas: it looks like NS loses at least 1 trick in each suit|pg||
nt|santyclz: Quite a x by w with his powerhouse.  Looks as if it will work out well though.|pg||
nt|gulyas: it would still have been a 50-50 shot at best for S to find out which minor to lead|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c6|nt|garnetts: would have to take it on a spade lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: probably|pg||
nt|gulyas: he is afraid that all finesses are off|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|santyclz: Excuse me, *her* powerhouse.|pg||
nt|chick: well, E did double and then cuebid even with W's pass|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|gulyas: he did refuse one finesse already...|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: declarer will not be certain who has the long clubs - if he thinks East has them, he will play diamonds normally - if West, he may run @DJ  |pg||
nt|gulyas: so if he ducks this, he gets a @H play, and the defense will have 5 tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gulyas: forcing dummy is a good idea, that way they cannot use the side suit in @Hs|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|gulyas: so if @Ss are 6-2, he has to take it|pg||
nt|gulyas: but he got it right|pg||
nt|garnetts: Might go off if he plays east to have bared a notional K@D in the end game|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/VGData/minirama.html  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|gulyas: he also might go off if he tries to endplay E|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mcarroll: Same bidding in Open|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gulyas: 4@H would have been 1 off probably|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gulyas: they are lucky this went down at all|pg||
nt|gulyas: with @Ds 1-1|pg||
nt|gulyas: unless they find the @S ruff|pg||
nt|chick: this is going to be a big swing to start the round ... wonder how it will affect morale for the rest|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S does not exactly seem automatic in reply to a reopening double, but it certainly has worked out well here|pg||
nt|gulyas: declarer sighs of relief when he sees the @C discard|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|gulyas: he will just play them normally, it is not likely that W plays @Cs that way if he had 5 of them|pg||
nt|mdgraham: either of which will work|pg||
nt|gulyas: right now, the @D finesse looks safe|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|s9|pg||

nt|mdgraham: indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=11  for standings after 11 rounds. First 8 after 13 rounds advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: tomorrow|pg||
nt|andyv:  same contract in OR|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think decalrer deserved that for a fine line of play--but east will be gutted|pg||
nt|gulyas: the only time he cannot take the @D finesse was if @Ss were 4-4|pg||
nt|elbec: same lead in the open room|pg||
nt|elbec: and same result...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club ten dropping on second round would also see the slam home'|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: but if the @Ss ran, he had 9 tricks from top|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, if @SJ had fallen, he would have had nine on top|pg||
nt|april7: an easy 3NT by NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  E hand a deceptively poor opener|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3 aces is always a good opener|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
nt|don paulus: 3 nt NS ?|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Macura|pg||
nt|nulda: 1s sound overcall 12+|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: snap :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: so I don't totally agree with you there|pg||
nt|elbec: good result for NS in open room|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|gulyas: EW can try 3NT, but it fails if it gets a @D lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: but yes, it was E who did the last wrong thing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 6@H a lucky make|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|elbec: 12-14 no trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  and 2NT artificial?|pg||
nt|nulda: North player - Michal Kopecky - had a bid success at San Remo a month ago|pg||
nt|nulda: 5th place in Open Pairs category|pg||
nt|cherdano:  that is a nice result indeed|pg||
nt|nulda: 2NT relay|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that 1@C opening is not so much skinny as anorexic |pg||
nt|mdgraham: as Daniel said,,passing 5@Cx with a void and six card trump support just looked wrong|pg||
nt|april7: 9 or 10 tricks, depending on the play|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: nt:12-14|pg||
nt|jstokes: club lead seems best for the def; might hold it to 7 tricks|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|andyv:  no spot cards make the hand poor|pg||
nt|gulyas: spot cards are bad, agree there|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d lead almost called for on this auction|pg||
nt|gulyas: lets see if S finds the killing lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: unless pd has a @H honor...|pg||
nt|gulyas: but I agree, @Ds should be led|pg||
nt|andyv:  sometimes you have to trust the opps|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: weird|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@C as we have seen is both majors, x probably showing a wk NT worth hand, or any strong hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: since this time its 13 balanced, she passed the forward-going 3@C|pg||
nt|gulyas: this looks like 4 tricks off the top, but with the @H ruff also coming, it will probably go down|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh-oh|pg||
nt|elbec: 1nt is 5+@s|pg||
nt|elbec: 2@c is any 15+|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|andyv:  this will be over quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|nulda: 3s minimum |pg||
nt|gulyas: with trumps not behaving, 2@S is the limit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but you can't imagine South passing now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5 imps, as 6@Cx-2 in the Open Room|pg||
nt|garnetts: The killing lead --if South gets it right|pg||
nt|elbec: 2@d is 8+|pg||
nt|elbec: 2nt is 15/17 with 4@c or 4@d|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|cherdano:  and South has second thoughts about inviting?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: o\_/ hand|pg||
nt|chick: excellent duck|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lovely.  Tough play.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  on a diamond lead South will set up clubs and a club ruff for an easy +650|pg||
nt|nulda: just two aces to give|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: Nab is calling TD after 4@s|pg||
nt|cherdano:  oh - if north bid a slow 3@S then there may be a problem|pg||
nt|nulda: I dont think, there should be a problem|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=9  for standings after 9 rounds. First 8 after 13 rounds advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: tomorrow|pg||
nt|nulda: 4@s normal bid after 2s of N|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, if N's bidding suggested an 11-13 range, I would|pg||
nt|gulyas: duck is a good move, now he just needs to have his entries to take all the finesses he needs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: since this is more or less a nothing hand, i have some thoughts on the previous deal, regarding multi vs a weak two....|pg||
nt|elbec: I'm doublechecking|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|cherdano:  yes but why did South bid 2N?|pg||
nt|gulyas: S only trusted his own suit, and that backfired|pg||
nt|gulyas: he has to take this and return it, or duck the 1st round|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: since N's @S10 can be the setting trick|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh|pg||
nt|don paulus: guess got to go down here|pg||
nt|rgdruru: yes, 2 down|pg||
nt|elbec: it seems that 2nt is 6+@h ...|pg||
nt|elbec: 3@c is asking|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Seems that both teams may be playing similar systems as they are replicating this bidding in Open|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|gulyas: I guess it didn't:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Nothing else to do actually--but he found it|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|elbec: 3@d is without singletons|pg||
mb|p|nt|nulda: probably slam trying :)|pg||
nt|chick: but it also cuts off communication for the heart ruff|pg||
nt|elbec: 3nt is even number of aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: 2n 15+ 6@H or 5332|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: 3n 5332|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: 3@D no sing|pg||
nt|elbec: ok so I have not the updated release of their system :)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|andyv:  a big pick up for Blue as OR stopped at 3@c|pg||
nt|gulyas: 7 IMPs to the US team instead of 5 the other way|pg||
nt|gulyas: the Greeks cannot afford too many mistakes like this|pg||
nt|andyv:  the lead is tough and K@d was the only entry to S's hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  as one spec points out, the contracted was also right sided|pg||
nt|andyv:  contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: good save there|pg||
nt|garnetts: that is very poor play |pg||
nt|gulyas: N can still work this out|pg||
nt|gulyas: take it and play a @C|pg||
mb|4D|nt|garnetts: but North might save the day |pg||
nt|marlowepi: the weak 2 left the stroing hand in passout seat, and this made it unlikely that EW would reach the slam--the 3S bid by E was very aggressive. in contrast, multi allowed the strong ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hand to double directly, so now 3S by E was much easier. something to think about|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  that would be a little aggressive :) |pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: it always seems to happen - you open light and pard piles you into game|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, that will help with avoiding the ruff|pg||
nt|gulyas: a @D would work as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  especially if the overcall showed 12+|pg||
nt|nulda: as far as I know Milan Macura, he tryies for a slam on every opportunity|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i see|pg||
nt|cherdano:  here a duck by East would have given declarer a small problem to think about|pg||
nt|cherdano:  whether to take the @S finesse at all|pg||
nt|elbec: as cards lay down, 6@h looks cold|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: well done |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes both@Cs and@Ds could not be more friendly|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello Joe|pg||
nt|mdgraham: of course, that may not be a light opening for NS. They may have an agreement that they open such hands |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hey Joe|pg||
nt|april7: a play to J of @H would have been a better idea than finesse in @C , this finesse had time to be done|pg||
nt|elbec: and spades as well|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|santyclz: Hi Dan, Mike.|pg||
nt|gulyas: since N chose @Ss, @Hs was likely to be 5-2|pg||
nt|rgdruru: now -1|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gulyas: if they do, S certainly overbid|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Open took one round less of bidding to get to the same contract, they diverged after round 4|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzur: sorry all connection problem|pg||
nt|elbec: anyway another good result by italy when only 12 boards are missing|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on the 40th anniversary of Woodstock, that was too much to resist|pg||
nt|april7: no only 9 tricks are available|pg||

nt|Walddk4: tomorrow|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cherdano:  actually he may still reject the @S finesse|pg||
pc|h2|nt|garnetts: I would find another partner if a club isn't led |pg||
nt|gulyas: yep|pg||
nt|gulyas: the lead was clearly a doubleton|pg||
nt|don paulus: 12 imps|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|elbec: which make 33 total imps of advantage|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cherdano:  in case West has three small hearts and the @SK|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|gulyas: well done|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|gulyas: 10 badly needed IMPs for France|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|hK|pc|c2|pg||
