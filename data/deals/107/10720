nt|nicksan: Hi all!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: brilliancies are few and far between|pg||
nt|brolucius: Borderline slam values on this one.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 20 opposite a pretty duff 12-count.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6@C is almost as good as the diamond finesse.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it will probably go down i guess|pg||
nt|brolucius: On some big tournament in the US recently, Roland noted that there had been 4 ot 5 singleton kings, all of them offside, and suspected a flaw in the dealing program.|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning everone|pg||
nt|brolucius: Singleton kings never seem to be onside for some reason, but this cannot be true in reality.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello Andy and Nick|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if North gets K@S past west then the @S will go away|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Roland and Nick|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 4NT possible now.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's some sort of cue but the name escapes me|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4NT would ask North to bid 6NT if he anything to spare for his opening.|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: North will have to look hard to find anything to spare.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  good breakes..unlikely to pick up K@d|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, they start with a commendable auction that will be rewarded by the lie of the cards.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: 5@C in the other room|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Yarden Cohen. Welcome to you too|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Yarden|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|brolucius: Spade lead was a strange choice. I suppose he knew that they had points to spare and the only chance of beating 4NT was to find partner with a good suit.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|andyv:  and gm David:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Diamond finesse is into the safe hand (who cannot effectively continue spades).|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|andyv:  fast claim and a couple of imps|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
mc|11|nt|Walddk2: Birman playing four-handed. Herbst has a third pair, Barel-Zack, sitting out in this set|pg||
nt|brolucius: Fearing that declarer might otherwise have the rest of the tricks, West grabs a trick with the @SA.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: close to slam but too many soft values|pg||
nt|ady: nice easy 3NT for n/s to start     can make 12 tricks|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: that is, S has too much soft stuff after 2N|pg||
nt|ady: might get to 6NT  going down|pg||
nt|sybarra: how about 6 @C?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nobody would make 12|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4NT by S and pass by N?|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C  is the best spot    if clubs 3-2  just need simple diamond finesse|pg||
nt|panja: South does not really have a good hand for slam..|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this is not an easy hand in the bidding. if S bids 4N, N will like the chances of 6C|pg||
nt|sybarra: skip the 6 @C comment, you need eyes on the ceiling|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|nt|hedyg: our operator is Genossar Itamar , shalom lecha!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some sort of raise to 4N?|pg||
nt|vugraphzuw: =]|pg||
nt|sybarra: or minors |pg||
nt|panja: 24 HCP missing in AK's...if N has 21 of them..some chance..if N has a J or a Q...2 key cards will be missing and slam is no better than 50%|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: you just need a @S lead to the ace,  guess the stiff K of @D....and voila |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: as so oftenb happens, the 2N opening preempts the side who owns the hand, making delicate slam exploration extremely difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4@s like quantitative 4NT|pg||
nt|ady: if you gesss the stiff K@D   you only need one spade trick|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is true also |pg||
nt|marlowepi: why would anyone do that?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but how to do that?|pg||
nt|panja: y Marshall, absolutely..|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|marlowepi: there is a verb to describe that, and it is not "guess"|pg||
pc|s3|nt|panja: 2Nt is what I would like to designate as 'offside opening', too far too soon|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  may well be starting with a swing here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@c shows 4 cards in @c|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: OR  in 4NT I am told   so n/s  will ;ose a little here being in clubs|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: just staying out of slam will make each NS hope for a swing. the slam is odds against single-dummy, but playable|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Pachtman has a feeling as to what Alon's pass is|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, not quite good enough for 3@S, which could cost a bit if partner held a blizzard.|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: Take-out double from West, who has already shown good hearts.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|andyv:  N needs to come to party soon|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: East can consider a retreat to 4@C, since West did not bid 3@D on the previous round.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: would 2NT by east be lebensohl i wonder|pg||
nt|brolucius: West would not double on such as 2-6-4-1 shape.|pg||
nt|andyv:  with this vul, i might even pass... down 3 or 4 might not be a horrible score.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: North is the only player who has not yet indicated his values.|pg||
nt|andyv:  N had an easy 3@s bid over 3@d...now what?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tough hand for Alon to judge. Father David could be weaker than he is|pg||
nt|brolucius: Kibitzers suggest a redoble of 2@S on the North cards, but perhaps he was a little weak for that action.|pg||
nt|nicksan: Think he'll pass. You don't want to have a major accident so early in the match... |pg||
nt|brolucius: You prefer them later on, do you?|pg||
nt|nicksan: First set is often like a game of chess...|pg||
nt|andyv:  pass could be a major acciednt|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: i thought that was coming|pg||

pc|c3|nt|andyv:  now 1|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s7|pc|cK|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you go in for close doubles, it helps when you can defend accurately - as N-S have done.|pg||
nt|nicksan: Club lead would have been even more accurate...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  still, i think 4@s should have been reached|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s6|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: In the other room East opened 3@C, South overcalled 4@S and West bid 5@C. Doubled and all pass|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c6|nt|andyv:  and A@s not the best of leads|pg||

nt|marlowepi: S hand on the strong side for 3S, but a bit thinfor 4S|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@S?|pg||
nt|panja: if S bids 4@S, I guess small @H lead needed to defeat...|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S   looks on fpr n/s     5@C   some sort of save |pg||
nt|marlowepi: S might compromise with D, but i predict 4S after the huddle|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hedyg: 4@s is NOT preempt here|pg||
mb|5C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: needs to lead @c|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|s5|pc|cK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S afraid it might be a cashout situation in the minors, hesitant to lead club in case N stuff is in diamonds and declarer could otherwise run trumps & hearts.  that Kx of hearts is ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a scary holding|pg||
nt|ady: should be down 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: official website : http://www.israbridge.com/home/results/2009/trl-final.pdf|pg||
nt|panja: when a small @D is now played to @DQ....South will have to win allowing E the @DK entry to the fourth Diamond, and a useful @S discard late in the day|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC : http://tinyurl.com/np5cm3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S would go down on heart lead. presumably the ace. heart ruff and club shift takes out dummy's entry prematurely and declarer has to lose 2 diamonds|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|s6|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|c6|pc|hK|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Probably 15-17 and already upgraded.|pg||

nt|panja: North could have overcalled 1@S, 4+ by agreement, or rebid 2@S on 2@H just now, secure in the knowledge that South held some values for his 2@D raise|pg||
nt|hedyg: his @ss were too bad to overcall that 4 card suit promising 5 cards|pg||

nt|yo_yo: is 1@D a transfer?|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
nt|nicksan: A quick one down?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not necessarily quick|pg||
nt|nicksan: !|pg||
nt|brolucius: Rather unlucky that the diamond ruff does not consume a trump trick.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: these transfer bids over 2@C are becoming very popular here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 1@C|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: South could give a suit-preference card on the second diamond, but here he has both black aces. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has entries everywhere|pg||
nt|yo_yo: kibs are asking about defence to this method, I dont know one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'll remember next time I play against you, Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: mike graham thinks: dbl=that suit, shown suit=t/o double |pg||

nt|hedyg: 2@HX was -1 with @d lead and repeated play|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: depends what a bid shows and what a passs shows|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think 2@s should show a clear preference|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: i dont think it is clear that the pass is forcing, assuming that 3C showed invitational or better values. S has forced at the 3 level, not at the 5 level. you CAN play the pass as ...|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 2@H to show that he has nothing for the overcall. Any other bid would show extra values|pg||

nt|andyv:  sorry, Kath!|pg||

nt|brolucius: Whoever called it the unassuming cue bid must have been one of the most awful dullards imaginable. (Unless he happens to be watching now...) |pg||

nt|Walddk2: I think that 'unassuming', originally, was pretty accurate because the cue bid did not necessarily show a fit for partner's suit. Merely a strong hand. Things have changed and so ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: should 'unassuming' in this context|pg||
nt|brolucius: The defenders are going their best, but declarer has too much artillery for them.|pg||
nt|andyv:  best for S to tap dummy in @c now|pg||
nt|andyv:  but A@d still an entry|pg||
nt|brolucius: Kibitzers will perhaps remember Newton's 5th Law, which states that the time spent playing a contract is inversely proportional to the level of the contract.|pg||
nt|brolucius: One of the reasons why I do not lick my lips when they stop in 1NT.,|pg||
nt|nicksan: In that case I'm glad they didn't stop in 1 @H...|pg||
nt|andyv:  I thought it was inversely proportional to his competence|pg||
nt|brolucius: I think you may be confusing it with the Law about 'The trick at which declarer makes a plan is inversely proportional to his competence.'|pg||
nt|andyv:  finessing for J@s seemed an unwarrented risk.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Did the bidding place North with the @SK?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I would think so...1N over call and no club lead from a sequence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A spectator tells me it is called an 'unassuming cue bid' because partner (who has overcalled) cannot assume anything about your holding in the opponents suit, unlike an ordinary ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: (control-showing) cue bid when you are looking for a slam after agreeing a trump suit. In that sense the name is still correct|pg||
nt|brolucius: But he had 10 points and might have held 8 for the 1NT bid. So, not so clear perhaps.|pg||

nt|brolucius: North could have bid 4@D with 4-card support, so 3@D suggests 3-card support and South may then be worried about the quality of the trumps.|pg||

nt|andyv:  exchange J@h for J@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think he would have bid differently|pg||
nt|brolucius: That's the point. South needs north to hold two trump honors in a three-card holding. No way for North to know that when it is South's first-bid suit.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Indeed. 5-3 fits are always a mile worse than 5-4 fits.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree Roland, looking at all the hands.  I just question whether it's S who determines that (with 3@s) bid or N (if 4@c bid by S)|pg||

nt|nicksan: Thanks Kath|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bye!|pg||
nt|brolucius: North has at least described his values by now.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, 4@C. That looks good.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, 5@C, because he has some good cards. Well, the auction looks great so far.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not the greatest slam of all time, but it's not the worst either|pg||
nt|brolucius: They may sense that they need a good one.|pg||
nt|andyv:  or 2:)|pg||
nt|nicksan: Only 113 boards left...|pg||
nt|brolucius: The opposing N-S pair have been doing everything right, so N-S may need to duplicate 'slam making' on this one.|pg||
nt|andyv:  holding K@s, stiff @c and the AK of @hs, I think S tortured N with 5@c bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: The VG operator has kindly told me why the Director was called on the earlier board: To cut a long story short, E was asking N a question reminding him what was the contract while ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: W was thinking of what card to play, N called the director|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  now all he has to do is make it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, let's hope that they make it, after the torrid session they have had so far.|pg||
nt|nicksan: A,K of trumps and start on hearts...|pg||
nt|andyv:  no good lead for E..probably J@s best|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: You are in big trouble is diamonds are not 3-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: if|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But when they are you need hearts no worse than 4-2|pg||
nt|andyv:  J@h may deceive declarer, but leading into the known 5 card suit|pg||

nt|Walddk2: We all see the danger now|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Desperately unlucky|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, that's very unlucky. It looked the best line, didn't it?|pg||
nt|brolucius: He would still be OK if the overruff was from the three trumps.|pg||
nt|brolucius: If there is any justice (which there rarely is in bridge), they will bid 6@D at the other table and go down too.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We all know the feeling. Alon hasn't done much right in this set, but he has also been unlucky|pg||
nt|nicksan: He will need to gather his wits for the next set, but even so they have a mountain to climb... |pg||
nt|andyv:  since @d had to be 3-2, seems like the best line was to play A and K of @d and lead @h to board|pg||
nt|andyv:  but declarer wasn't sure if J@h was stiff or from Jx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The next set (the last today) is scheduled to start in 10 minutes. That is not going to happen. They are on board 14 in the other room, so we will be facing a delay|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am beginning to feel rather jealous about Kathy enjoying some splendid supper while we wait for West to decide on his return (which does not matter at all, as it happens).|pg||
nt|andyv:  if from Jx, then he can fall back on club finesse and ruff club|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
mc|11|nt|andyv:  or simply ruff out @hs for his 12th trick if they are 4-2|pg||

nt|sybarra: looks like a lot to do |pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|hedyg: play on @hs, let E make a @d by overruffing|pg||
nt|hedyg: then play AK@D, ruff 1 more @H, ruff 1@c and disc 1 @c on the last @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: hmm now what |pg||
nt|hedyg: usually the 3@d bid shows 4cards...|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @D  and then what|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 5 @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s was cuebid|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4@s was natural in case N had 5/6 @d and 4 @ss|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably 5C over 3S would have been void-showing (possibly exclusion). otherwise it might be an appealing call|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: now for the challenge |pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont think you can time it for making 6 |pg||
nt|hedyg: as "runnerup" says the line works if you play AK@D first as well|pg||
nt|marlowepi: seems fairlyu straightforward to make this by setting up hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: if you try ruffing 2@cs you are down|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hedyg: sometimes @hs are even 3-3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: well this should help|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont need 33 hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will help |pg||
nt|sybarra: didnt mean to echo Hedy |pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: now just need @d split|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this lead gives declarer options, i.e. trying to cater to 4 trumps in the W hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: N knew from the 5 @H bid that S did not have the Q@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: but nowhere to go from the 5 @H level|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: Last board of the set now. Many thanks to Yarden Cohen, our excellent operator at Ra'anana. Well done!|pg||

nt|brolucius: On the possible diamond slam, where they stopped in 3NT at this table, they played in 5@D at the other table.|pg||
