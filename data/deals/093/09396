nt|daman: 5 of either minor is doomed|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not easy to stop in this hand for N/S|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am told by a spec that"this will be close in the ending, most of house's lead is a handicap" - is this true?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzky: it is, they had 99 IMPs handicap|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc09/fc_main_en.htm  is the link to the website with results|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The handicap procedure is explained there|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: ah then we might get some excitement|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1H!|mb|p|mb|1N|an|17-19 BAL|mb|p|nt|roswolf: great looking format for a competition!|pg||
nt|daman: I would have overcalled with the West hand|pg||
nt|daman: if the match is really that close and even if it isn't|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now possible 2down at 3Nt |pg||
nt|Walddk2: What is 1@H, Erik, balanced 8-11?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|an|4+|mb|p|nt|yuval10: Fohrer lo sofer oto biclal|pg||
nt|yuval10: oops sry|pg||
nt|vugraphzky: i think they play carrot, denies 5c M, 6c minor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That explains it|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: a present at West for his silence|pg||
nt|daman: I wonder if East would have led a @S on     1@C - 1NT - 3NT?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|daman: good grief|pg||
nt|bridge_one: heppp|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|roswolf: hmmm sadistic!|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|daman: hence the reason for the handicap|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now @S it is obliged ...|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|daman: an obscure way to win IMPs|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h6|pc|s7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sT|nt|roswolf: indeed but effective|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: Mattsson knew what he was doing; just wanted an extra trick :)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: hi Jan and John :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Bob, Hans and Allan|pg||

nt|allanr44: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|rado: welcome all to the 3rd segment of Bulgarian team fianl|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Should we start with a fast 5 @D|pg||
nt|werge: So - here we are|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know the systems in use?|pg||
nt|snorris: you mean 10th trick+|pg||
nt|rado: final|pg||
nt|snorris: Precision system on|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hi all|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hello all :)|pg||

nt|bridge_one: hello everyone from Italy|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Ralf, all|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: Hi all. WELCOME|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D multi, of course|pg||
mb|2S|nt|cindy: hi all :)|pg||
nt|werge: 3 @S = partner bid 3 NT, if you have a @s-stopper|pg||
nt|werge: But the defence has 5 redtricks|pg||
nt|werge: - or 3 NT|pg||
nt|allanr44: good idea|pg||
nt|rado: will have the pleasure to watch reigning Euro pairs champs vs natinal pairs champs|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I dont believe this|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3S|nt|sybarra: hi Cindy :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi cindy, shirley, and specs|pg||
nt|cindy: hi marshall :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Marshall |pg||
nt|werge: red tricks|pg||
nt|werge: - and 4 @S is a winner - a lucky one|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: Precision Club for both pairs|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w are a strong club i think and it looks like n/s are too|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Almost everyone plays Precision in Bulgaria|pg||
nt|april7: y|pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
mb|4D|nt|swanson: Is there a web site for this event (Gold Coast of Australia)?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Horwitz is here by virtue of winning the Swiss Qualifying|pg||
nt|werge: North is more disciplined here than South...|pg||
nt|bobholl: why not double with S ?|pg||
nt|werge: Double - or PASS|pg||
nt|werge: So - 3 @S now|pg||
nt|allanr44: spade lead would be good for east in a diamond contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty for info|pg||
nt|rado: both pairs using strong @C, 14-16 nt|pg||
nt|rado: leads 2/4 best and udca count mainly|pg||
nt|bobh1: many play S's takeout double of a nebulous minor to focus on the majors|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Rdl have a means specific, probably one suit very long (to play in)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the Dbl by East is a gadget that i appreciate very much (semibal 12/14 )|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East can Dbl indipendent from 4 cards in a major|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hi again|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Ralf again :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: we had a problem with bridge file and had to play new games. sry for diley|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Carrol|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: 1+6432|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 82|pg||
nt|werge: Ace of @H - and small @C, South has just overcalled, you might misguess|pg||
nt|bobholl: even without @S lead 5@D will make|pg||
nt|snorris: 2@c game force?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi all|pg||
mb|5D|nt|janm: I don't know, I'm afraid.|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.qldbridge.com/gcc/           tournament site|pg||
nt|janm: I think this is matchpoints, and we'll be watching 3 boards at a time, right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that look like a 4H call to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ohno had to win a 24 board match to get back into the run for the gold|pg||
nt|npcjpn: sorry, private.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 4NT is a good save.|pg||
nt|allanr44: it will, but the pressure would be off|pg||
nt|bobholl: small @C lead is unfindable|pg||
nt|werge: West followed my bidding-line, not at gerat player then|pg||
nt|werge: great|pg||
nt|bobholl: KISS keep it simplle stupid is no bad advice|pg||
nt|werge: For sure not - buy not always followed|pg||
nt|allanr44: such a lot of spade values ...|pg||
nt|werge: In my club the bidding here would be: 2 @S pas 3 @S all pass|pg||
nt|bobholl: E is afraid of his @D :)|pg||
nt|allanr44: and rightly so|pg||
nt|werge: Many pairs plat, that in this situation (West) you bid the enemy suit, which you can stop|pg||
nt|werge: play|pg||
nt|snorris: @d lead or try to find pd?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: agree|pg||
nt|sybarra: prefer 4 ht, but all will be well here also |pg||
nt|werge: Yes - undobled, 5 @C is the right contract, if doubleb'|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Yamada showed his hand and claimed nine :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: where will this end up?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Our operator is the one and only Silvia|pg||
nt|snorris: unspecified..|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: this is an absolutely gorgeous site..... Roland should have sent us!|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Right.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.  Welcome from the beautiful Poconos where it's -10c and snowing hard.|pg||
nt|swanson: N-S could afford to bid spades up to the 3-level, but they haven't found a way to enter the auction.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Welcome to the GC, 26c and we're all indoors playing bridge . :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.qldbridge.com/gcc/results.php  - results|pg||
nt|bobholl: another @S bid to say i like @D|pg||
nt|werge: I would not blame East, when - in 30 seconds - he claims for one down|pg||
nt|werge: - in 5 @D, not in 6|pg||
nt|bobh1: so N should excercise caution in bidding the other minor|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 10 easy tricks |pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 11 with a @d finess|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: 2@d had a very wide range here and East, with nice shape and a little extra in terms of values invited something higher - I think they'd better stop here though|pg||
nt|cindy: this will work out ok but i would bid 4H|pg||
nt|werge: 8 easy tricks - might be 9|pg||
nt|roswolf: south taking the safe option on board 1|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mariner1: hi Ally!|pg||
nt|forni: and we're back at Ohno vs Horwitz, which became an exciting match after two swings in favour of Ohno.|pg||
nt|forni: welcome back, all 23 of you!|pg||
nt|forni: :P|pg||
pc|s5|nt|snorris: and relays thereafter|pg||
nt|snorris: from south|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bobholl: they play a fairly sound overcall :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes you could see how 9 tricks will occur especially on this lead|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, actually my comment was just about the S hand, not about the probable result|pg||
nt|forni: starts off exciting|pg||
nt|forni: ouch|pg||
nt|bobholl: now surely a @S lead sure i said :)|pg||
nt|werge: Best lead for opponents|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|cindy: we knew that :)|pg||
nt|snorris: this wins too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Rado Radev from Bulgaria|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: have the guts to duck?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i don;t eat that part|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: she is considering :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: now small @C :)|pg||
nt|werge: If South had doubled 1 @D, this was a lay-down|pg||
nt|rado: Hi all, hope to watch exciting bridge by my yesterday opponents:)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|forni: too bad|pg||
nt|forni: 4@D will make, but so will 4@H|pg||
pc|c8|nt|april7: on a @S lead N might lose control ofthe hand and go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: wlc, Rado @H|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: wow, tough crowd|pg||
nt|sybarra: could not cost could it?|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult decesion now finesse @D or nbot|pg||
pc|cK|nt|allanr44: ah well ...|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|snorris: if north choose to throw @s on @d|pg||
nt|april7: he should |pg||
pc|h9|nt|bobholl: normally this works fine but not now|pg||
nt|bobholl: chickken ! :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: understandable no @H raise|pg||
nt|Walddk4: For your information fellow commentators, E-W are women ("she/her")|pg||
nt|allanr44: he would have loved to play NT, but his heart stop was tenuous  :)|pg||
nt|allanr44: oops, she, sorry|pg||
nt|werge: Well played by South - he avoided the OVERtrick|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|rado: the team of Prima has 3 pairs while Quantum 5 people|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good Morning all|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|werge: So close your eyes - and play a @S|pg||
nt|rado: 3nt is easy to make so Primabild might return some imps back on this board|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|forni: even worse, if you play the @H and @C from top, you'll make 12 tricks without any trouble.|pg||
nt|snorris: not if he sniffs this one|pg||
pc|d5|nt|snorris: sh just finesse|pg||
nt|snorris: to make sure of the contract|pg||
nt|april7: N will be shortened in trumps with @D |pg||
nt|snorris: very unlikly a singelton as it wasnt lead|pg||
nt|snorris: take the ace is best of corse|pg||
nt|snorris: or not..|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: Nanev is thinking|pg||
nt|snorris: east just needs to duck the @h|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|april7: E ducks the 9 of @HG and has to make a long trumtrick|pg||
nt|snorris: 7-8 tricks|pg||
nt|snorris: depends on endplay or not|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|sybarra: not letting you up Mashall!|pg||
nt|april7: °D back|pg||
nt|april7: @D|pg||
pc|dA|nt|april7: a useless discard|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@D in Carrot is 4+, always unbalanced|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|Walddk2: 11-16|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this also has swing potential|pg||
nt|vugraphzky: they don't play Carrot, just carrot's answers on a strong @C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh I see|pg||
mb|1H|mb|4S|nt|bridge_one: i think would be a swing also without carrot :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|roswolf: simple and direct and should be exciting|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must win; otherwise West gets the chance to switch to a club|pg||
nt|daman: correct|pg||

nt|swanson: Not a good effort by N-S.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peter Gill taking no chances with the @S finesse -- 5@C making 5 is nice score|pg||
nt|werge: In my world, North has two 5-cards suits...|pg||
nt|bobholl: well he didn't :)|pg||
nt|snorris: ah must have played the 10|pg||
nt|rado: E might start with 2@D multi|pg||
nt|snorris: realy?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree martin! |pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, sure a try - impossible all pass|pg||
nt|mcarroll: open room is also having problems, I suspect that the boards the players have are not the ones we are seeing|pg||
nt|Walddk7: wrong boards, pls shut down Silvia. Momchil did|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: we will be back after about 10 min.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h on NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: this is Open Pairs so we will not have scores shown......|pg||
nt|swanson: E-W will likely be off one in 2@S here.  Dangerour for SOuth to enter vulnerable with weak minor suits.|pg||
nt|mariner1: weak NT by E|pg||
nt|forni: really?|pg||
nt|forni: if North had 5-5, in my world he would've started off with 1@H|pg||
nt|rado: 1NT 14-16 maybe|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Steganov Aronov play precision with the use of 2Nt for bal 18/20, and 1Nt 14/16 ,,, i want to see was will open with 17 :)|pg||
mb|1D!|an|11-16 w/ 1+D|nt|ahollan1: Yamada-Ohno have been playing together for 30+ years. In Beijing their team won the Senior Event|pg||
nt|bobholl: we don't know wheather  the chinese names are male or female :)|pg||
nt|allanr44: Easy 12 - 13 is a worry|pg||
mb|1H|nt|forni: so 6-5 is probable|pg||
nt|werge: 2 @D - you agree - I double|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @h is a normal contract|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 1@h on S instead of D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl at  strong 1@C must be a very interesting hand, otherwise is a information for strong line ...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|janm: West will probably transfer to spades... wrong again!|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 aces opposite a strong @C :)|pg||
nt|april7: 2@S off 1|pg||
nt|bobh1: to me the E hand is a weak 2 bid in that seat at those colors|pg||
mb|2H|nt|cindy: hi all    little bit of a late start|pg||
nt|allanr44: and the singleton D!  May go overboard|pg||
nt|werge: The pre-empt from East here helps - N/S...|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4nt know pass or 5@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: now|pg||
nt|roswolf: aggressive raise on a doubleton by west|pg||
nt|werge: A textbook double in my "world"|pg||
nt|rado: tr5ansfers in competition|pg||
mb|3D|nt|marlowepi: with the void and the heart fit, i don;t think i could bid less than 3S with the W hand|pg||
nt|npcjpn: no hope for tenth:)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi all|pg||
nt|bobh1: 2@s should imply a @c fit|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mariner1: the distribution here helps the effort in 3@C|pg||
nt|werge: I meant, I will show the hand as 5-5!|pg||
nt|werge: 710|pg||
nt|bobholl: enough for 5@S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Vladimir Marashev|pg||
nt|vlad9:  hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes double more flexible|pg||
mb|3S|nt|forni: ahh|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: hi vlad|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry - I mixed up things, thought East opened 1 @H, it´s early in Copenhagen|pg||
nt|roswolf: :) so did i!!|pg||
nt|werge: Anyway - looks like 110|pg||
nt|ralfwil: well done!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Usually it is difficult to bid game when opps have opened a strong @C, but the standard for this opening has diminished and opps are now less intimidated by it|pg||
nt|bridge_one: good auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: @SA on side, @c 3 3 , @D 3 3 with Q@D in pocket|pg||
nt|swanson: I would have preferred to pass with the South hand with the plan of making a takeout double of hearts if E-W try to play at the two level.|pg||
nt|mariner1: the @H lead works for defense for taps|pg||
nt|janm: 2NT seems a pretty big position to take certainly|pg||
nt|mariner1:  http://www.qldbridge.com/gcc/           tournament site  -|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or else 2NT, followed by 3S (depending on agreements)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play a Weak NT and an uncommon 2@D opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we should be able to follow most of the other auctions|pg||
nt|vlad9:  everyone plays precision here|pg||
nt|vlad9:  precision for bulgarians is something like polish clubs for the poles|pg||
nt|snorris: while n-s can win 3 @h|pg||
nt|april7: not the Qof @C,@H lead best|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: N has the hand I like ot be able to bid a nonforcing 2H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after the jump to 4S, Pass by E would surely be forcing, so W should really pass here|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Bakkeren asking about the 2NT bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like lebbish|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Bakkeren in the tank|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so that is what it is|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: in the tank.....|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Bakkeren ...thinking|pg||
nt|sybarra: challenging hand |pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably Dbl is both Majors 8,9+|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with @H 2/2 np for the declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: just in case S has some 6/4 red suited hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be in the tank also |pg||
nt|marlowepi: if W was asking about the 2NT bid, i would guess he was just stalling for time. it is pretty obvious what kind of hand N has|pg||
nt|bobholl: sensible|pg||
nt|allanr44: if they bid the grand, and get the heart lead, the trump 9 is out of action right away|pg||
nt|werge: Impossible to do better for N/S|pg||
nt|snorris: 10-11 tricks|pg||
nt|bobh1: should make unless declarer finds some reason to misguess @h's|pg||
nt|snorris: with the Q of @s lead|pg||
nt|rado: +1 at 52 cards, but normali just at the table|pg||
pc|h4|nt|npcjpn: they play 2@c as a puppet to 2@d, usually a start of a sign-off, hence 2@d is Stayman.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Jim Patrick|pg||
pc|hA|nt|2hplus4: hi there|pg||
nt|vlad9:  hi|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes but is it enough with 4-4 in majors?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: who is a 5 @S bidder? |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: shd reach and make 4 @S here|pg||

nt|werge: But to-morrow will be even worse - summertime begins|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|janm: How greedy should N be?|pg||
nt|santyclz: An inspired or foolish bid, depending on the result.|pg||
nt|mariner1: agreed, the VUL position vs NV might indicate prudence here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|swanson: The cards are lying quite well for N-S and declarer is forced to take advantage of it.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pass by E would have been forcing|pg||
nt|forni: well I have to agree with you on that one :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: well, i like playing that NF, but i would still pass 2D|pg||
nt|cindy: sometimes partner has the perfect hand where we can make 4H|pg||
nt|keylime: evening everyone|pg||
nt|cindy: hi|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello Cindy, Marshall and Dwayne|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with only 3HCP in my 2 suits and no spade spots, i would not be eager to advance the bidding. i doubt we are missing a game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi roland|pg||
nt|bobholl: what is the theoritical best line ?|pg||
nt|april7: maybe even 4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Sunil Varghese and Ruud von Seida|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi and welcome to the 2nd segment of the seminfinal form the Gold Coast|pg||
nt|boedhy: hello all|pg||
nt|snorris: maybe|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now he can make 11|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: and cindy and dwayne & specs|pg||
nt|cindy: not me either|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bridge_one: One Expert fronm Bulgaria told me that Dbl is Suction: means or next suit (here @D) or the other 2 suit (here Majors) - it is much used also in Ungheria|pg||
pc|h6|nt|npcjpn: east is hoping partner has four hearts, but.....|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: lead has made it a bit easier|pg||
nt|rado: similar system at other room so expecting no swing here|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|swanson: Well, maybe not.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So you hardly see natural systems in Bulgaria, Vladimir?|pg||
nt|vlad9:  it is enourmosly difficult to score back 50 imps in 16 boards but not impossible|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|keylime: W-E if memory serves are playing Dutch Doubleton|pg||
nt|cindy: its rare but there are times when partner has nothing but the A in diamonds and its perfect|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we know that @C are 3-2 and @DK is onside, but Ohno will try not to rely upon the finesse|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: wonder what 3 sp would have been instead of 2?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|keylime: while N-S are using a weak NT, but unconfirmed about whether it's a strong club system or not|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but i would bid 5S on a different hand, with different bidding|pg||
nt|snorris: south didnt like the vulnerability so no "both majors" bid|pg||
pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: what isn;t rare is for partner to have 2263, with 2D our last makeable spot|pg||
nt|cindy: thats true|pg||
nt|keylime: especially with the lack of 1NT rebid as well|pg||
nt|cindy: but would you give up a chance for plus 620 when you might go down 100 ?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: after using up dummy's entries though -- he may have no other choices thought|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe @D discard, @H then endplay West?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes. the Nickell team can do it regularly it seems but few others|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops   Ohno is female -- SHE may look for other options|pg||
nt|april7: now more down|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sunsamvar: now he can combine chances of @Hk being right or clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|april7: @C and @H back|pg||
nt|snorris: better @d and @h back|pg||
nt|april7: y|pg||
nt|snorris: small @d..|pg||
nt|april7: small @D, very diddicuklt,only double dummy|pg||
nt|april7: butits not so important in this contract|pg||
nt|snorris: that would mean 4 down|pg||
nt|snorris: only 1 more trick to e-w|pg||
nt|snorris: if...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bridge_one: The suction is used also vs NT|pg||
pc|dT|nt|keylime: I would. Partner never has what I need for game. :-)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|boedhy: yes will make it now|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: both work :)|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|boedhy: I recently had a long discusion abouy leading from Kings against trump contracts |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: so much for alternatives :(|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: depends on what i thought the odds were on us having a game. i rate them slightly under googolpex to one/ if pd has 64 reds, most of my hand is wasted|pg||
nt|cindy: you poor thing :)|pg||
nt|vlad9:  few bulgarians play natural|pg||

pc|c7|pg||

nt|mariner1: off 1 might score some,,, not easy to see|pg||
nt|mariner1: very true John..........|pg||
nt|swanson: Two 10% results for N-S in my judgment.|pg||
nt|mariner1: when is an aggressive contract its usually best to try to make it.......|pg||
nt|nickf: Hi - we'll see North's daughter later on I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: when in|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, shirley, i was wondering too, since 2S seems like such an underbid|pg||
nt|sybarra: it didnt show the shape imo |pg||
nt|sybarra: but oh well,  |pg||
nt|sybarra: someone brought out the goulash dealer?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: checking conditions -- the semi-final will be 4-10 board segments|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@H here for E/W|pg||
nt|boedhy: Mike Lawrence tought in his books that it is really bad.....|pg||
nt|bobholl: i meant in 6 if @D are 52 still ruff small @D :)|pg||
nt|vlad9:  precision in various modifications 90%|pg||

nt|vlad9:  and some other highly artificial systems|pg||
nt|roswolf: first slam|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Excellent 6@C|pg||
nt|werge: And a good one!|pg||
nt|snorris: now what to play e-w?|pg||
nt|bobh1: fortunately he was not sufficiently imaginative|pg||
nt|snorris: 1 nt by north..|pg||
nt|rado: 3rd seat Skorchev may treat his nad as 1NT 14-16|pg||
nt|bobh1: i agree with that|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Another 5-6|pg||
nt|forni: yeap|pg||
nt|forni: and it'll become interesting what one would bid with S after 1@C|pg||
nt|forni: I'm very fond of bidding known 2-suiters|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: a spec suggested that W might have deliberately underbid, walking the dog. but S had shown his hand and N was marked with only a few points. so it easily could have gone all pass|pg||
nt|allanr44: the trump 8 would become significant if the Ds were 5 2|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sunsamvar: i had a partner who has never led away from a king :) |pg||
mb|1S|nt|werge: Here, North is the best to be declarer in 3 NT|pg||
nt|forni: so if I could bid 2@C or 3@C or 2NT or 3@D as @S+@D, I would surely do so.|pg||
nt|forni: But|pg||
nt|forni: I don't realise... my 1@C is forcing, and it's actually kinda normal that E would open a strong 2@C :P|pg||
nt|vlad9:  2/1 the rest|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup and you would have thought easy to bid|pg||
nt|snorris: 25hp..but|pg||
nt|rado: no S may risk weak 2@H raise|pg||
nt|mcarroll: W will be grateful that E has a clear 4@S bid|pg||
mb|3H|nt|cindy: p p p|pg||
nt|forni: now E has an interesting problem|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult bid for shen now|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Well, just about with the odds. 53%. Clubs 2-2 or singleton queen|pg||
nt|Walddk5: On a spade lead that is|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not vuln 4@S is a valid option|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 6 compact cards|pg||
mb|3S|nt|keylime: N-S may get a little nudge here into game|pg||
nt|cindy: yes|pg||
nt|cindy: N wouldnt pass 3C anyway|pg||
mb|4H|nt|nickf: Fiona Brown, who came 4th in World Mixed Pairs a few years ago when just 22|pg||
nt|forni: yes blackwould would surely do, I always think too difficult|pg||
nt|forni: :S|pg||
nt|boedhy: better to underlead aces in his opinion. and well I agree with him |pg||
nt|bobholl: solved neatly|pg||
nt|werge: Much better - with no @s-lead!|pg||
nt|rado: they have 2@D constructive raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: NS's NT is always 14-16 p|pg||
nt|bobh1: Jxxx is not my favorite holding to lead from against 1n|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Pushed there by N|pg||
mb|4S|nt|marlowepi: i would be very nervous of cidding just 3C with the S hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my methods, pass is strong inaction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now THAT is surprising -- I thought Yamada would double again|pg||
nt|bobholl: rule of 16 not applied (points+@S )|pg||
nt|Walddk5: On any other leads it's obviously much better|pg||
nt|snorris: lebenshol now?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good lead - and this slam has no hope|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: THree boards per round I believe, then we get new players (at least different players).|pg||
nt|cindy: i bet he was starting to sweat a little|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: N might bid on question with Q doubleton 3NT and might make it on @H  lead or will try @C finesse which unfortunbately doesn't work|pg||
nt|rado: transfer Lebs 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: Fiona was also an excellent Vugraph Operator during the Yeh Cup!|pg||
nt|boedhy: And was he right ? Sunil|pg||
nt|snorris: e-w are up over now|pg||
nt|april7: XX and then 3NT|pg||
nt|rado: anti double at 3@H|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|swanson: This delayed raise by East generally is used to show a solid values for 2@H.|pg||
nt|keylime: 3@c seens a little conservative to me as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: letting the opponents play 2-level in 8 card fit tends to lose more than it gains|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if u have to underlead i wud prefer to underlead from a king|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but i am not arguing with the LAW Rudd :)|pg||
nt|boedhy: aggresive bidding from Shen. But even with this good lead will make 4@s on the @c I think|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes just set up clubs|pg||
nt|bobholl: there you are a pass would have been better :)|pg||
nt|vlad9:  1nt seems very easy here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: i suspect he was trying to walk the dog|pg||
nt|allanr44: EW would need to pick well to make 3H|pg||
nt|bobholl: peek would be easier|pg||
nt|allanr44: That's where we have the advantage  :)|pg||
nt|2hplus4: This looks comfortable|pg||
nt|werge: Best move: West is declarer|pg||
nt|roswolf: now west should power on|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 nt wins with a club lead from south...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cindy: would you just forget the club suit and bid 4H ?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Lots of tricks if he gets @D correct|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a bad lead! Giving a tempo away with a 4-card @s!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but not lucky :) to find void in the dummy with 4 cards fit in @C is the worst |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|swanson: With less, East is required to simply raise 1@H to 2@H and forget about spades.|pg||
nt|april7: no chance here at all|pg||
nt|snorris: no double no trouble..|pg||
nt|snorris: wondering if 5 @d is better|pg||
pc|sK|nt|keylime: I would bid clubs, to cater to short hearts - with seven of them, and the side club suit, I want to clue pard in to my hand; I certainly will have probably one more bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes , the lead help very much !|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|sunsamvar: Has to use the sparse entries to dummy wisely|pg||
nt|rado: underleading bare Jacks is not favouarable att all,but happens:)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: and as we see 3@D is excellent contract|pg||
nt|bobholl: this lead migth give overtrick :)|pg||

pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: i would probably bid 4C ovber 2D|pg||
nt|allanr44: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: is there a danger of getting too high?|pg||
nt|werge: Not any longer...|pg||
nt|roswolf: no slow typing!|pg||

nt|snorris: good contract|pg||

nt|rado: 6@D seems good one|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 1 @D the "yucky" hand |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: N/S are playing weak NT |pg||
nt|allanr44: not many cards right for EW here|pg||

nt|rado: 4 @H makable|pg||
nt|rado: and 4@S sacrify|pg||
nt|rado: "suction" again|pg||
nt|bobh1: at imps 6@d is definitely the right one to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Gill plays transfer openings in some partnerships, but I didn't think this was one of them|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: finally a game contract that has decent chances to make|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I thought EW were playing Precision. Why not 2@C opener?|pg||
nt|vlad9:  because the cl  suit is too weak|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: as vlad said there are a lot of modifications :)|pg||
nt|rado: pass or correct 4@S bid|pg||
nt|snorris: e-w doing well|pg||
nt|rado: putting max pressure on big @C opener|pg||
nt|snorris: interfering as much as possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: make that 14 pairs 7 tables|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 2@h is a limit for NS with careful defence.|pg||
nt|werge: But better let E/W play here|pg||
nt|bobholl: fairly difficult to reach to good 4@S|pg||
nt|snorris: and 5 @c a good sacrifice|pg||
pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: at first glance it may look like S  should rebid 4H, then bid 5C over 4S. but that does not have to be a suit--it could even be a void. so S wanted to bid clubs at his second turn. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: odd for a 7-5 hand to be awkward to bid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3nt ofcourse depends on locating the @Cq|pg||

nt|allanr44: whew!|pg||
nt|snorris: too|pg||
mc|13|nt|vugrapha3: sorry :)|pg||
nt|forni: I can agree with that|pg||
nt|forni: And even though East has a great hand if West would've bid 4@S directly, he doesn't nearly have enough aces to continue over 4@S|pg||
nt|werge: The danger is, that North - after 1 @S - can bid a leas-directing suit|pg||
nt|werge: lead-directing|pg||
nt|forni: N can bid a lead-directing suit for if W becomes declarer?|pg||
nt|werge: East MUST have showed the hand allready|pg||
nt|forni: The trouble for Peake now is: Why can't west have AKxxxx, Jxx, xx, Axx|pg||
nt|werge: OK, sleepy...|pg||
nt|bobholl: did i say difficult :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|werge: This time, E/W can bid a lot more - and make it|pg||

mb|1H|nt|mariner1: only part scores here it seems|pg||
nt|cindy: many players dont like to open 2C on two suiters but with kokish you can show two suits (if one of the suits is spades) easily|pg||

nt|marlowepi: you mean, if the opps don;t crowd you. but that is the reason why players don;t like to open 2C with 2-suiters in the first place|pg||
nt|petergill: EW are playing Precision, hence the bidding of the previous hand. |pg||
nt|werge: But a @d-lead kills you|pg||
nt|april7: I open N's hand|pg||
nt|snorris: me too|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cindy: yes i know|pg||
nt|keylime: I had to go retrieve a guest downstairs :-)|pg||

nt|bobh1: w is strapped for a bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: @C lead?|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps but difficult to defend i think|pg||
nt|werge: But North will get trouble with the discards on a @h-lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and he/she survived|pg||
nt|werge: Here only the bidding has interest|pg||
nt|npcjpn: twelve tricks.|pg||
nt|werge: - 6 @c being ice-cold|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C 10-15, long clubs|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@H (level 1) is forcing - they play no forcing level-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: @s lead and quick claim|pg||
nt|snorris: thats the 9. trick yes|pg||
nt|april7: on @H lead E ducks twice for fear of 5 @H  in S's hand|pg||
nt|april7: but S will lead @S not to aggrevate his P|pg||
nt|rado: max overcall dbl|pg||
pc|s7|nt|keylime: she survived the 25 story ride in a really cramped elevator thankfully :-)|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D artificial enquiry, at least game-try strength|pg||
nt|roswolf: as west i would have raised to 3|pg||
nt|snorris: they heve this one stopped:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|swanson: Most experts around here respond with the South hand.  There is minimal playing strength but passing mades life so easy for the opponents.|pg||
nt|rado: with 2 Kings potential entries S tryes "surprise" lead|pg||
nt|snorris: more troble for west|pg||
pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: 2NT seems like a lot to bid on that hand|pg||

nt|boedhy: this is high|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but might get a @S lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: strange choice for 3NT but will work :)|pg||
nt|vlad9:  ty for watching carefully:)|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Easy mistake to make. I've done it often :)|pg||
nt|vlad9:  right:)|pg||
nt|werge: West has seen too many bad overcalls, that´s why he only bis 2 NT|pg||
nt|bobh1: 3n has play?|pg||
nt|snorris: west|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mariner1: 2N will not fare well here ,,,,, to much out and off|pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart king, then D to the 9|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - my firt name is Hans|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, even with the spade lead, later a low heart switch from South will give declarer a guess which is impossible to get right.|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C = a pile of rubbish, 3NT = hopeful|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|keylime: I have nightmares of -500 in a partial with South's hand|pg||
nt|cindy: or 800 :)|pg||
nt|keylime: at least they are 5-5 and not a frisky 5-4 as some would have|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would bid. |pg||
nt|allanr44: @DK will make this very difficult|pg||
pc|cT|nt|keylime: 2nt is pushing a bit with the weak diamond suit|pg||
nt|mrdct: this could be a good result horwitz - NS can makea few @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this won't be as easy as the @C games|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|swanson: If you Google Yeh 2009 you can find the site for the tournament.|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.yehcup09.com.au/  - Tournament site|pg||
nt|keylime: I think to be fair, it depends on the NT defense|pg||
nt|keylime: if you're a DONT user - 2@d fits the bill |pg||
nt|npcjpn: so depends on a lead.|pg||
nt|werge: Dangerous board here for E/W - if the play trandfer in OR|pg||
nt|bobholl: strange thta 2@S  denies @H support uncommon :) ?|pg||
nt|allanr44: not in 4   lol|pg||

pc|h3|nt|swanson: Declarer might will guess diamonds - after all SOuth did pass 1@H.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome Dave!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: difficult the lead @H after thid auction |pg||
nt|ralfwil: my line in this contract is a cross ruff|pg||
pc|h7|nt|swanson: well|pg||
nt|mariner1: that is the Yeh Cup site|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you could have a game opposite very little. and when you have this shape it is unlikely they will double before bidding something|pg||
nt|cindy: i wouldnt bid no matter what|pg||
nt|allanr44: now the trump finesse and the double spade finesse works, but would fail on a D lead (for 6 that is)|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Possible 2 trumps and 2 black kings to lose|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 1 trump|pg||
nt|2hplus4: now|pg||
nt|snorris: not if east plays on @c|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|cindy: partner is passed hand and we are red|pg||
nt|boedhy: Well Peter that is best defence but will he find it...|pg||
nt|petergill: important to switch to a low heart, not a top heart|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mariner1:  http://www.qldbridge.com/gcc/           - Tournament Site|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club ace , club and N is down|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes the @S switch on the previous bd allowed the game to keep|pg||
nt|bobholl: up to 8 sure tricks now|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|petergill: Ouch - |pg||
nt|boedhy: Can probably take his time for it....|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @S2 must be indicating @D honour|pg||
nt|petergill: The longer Ou thinks, the more declarer might work out what Ou is thinking about|pg||
nt|petergill: a heart is the only chance - declarer must hhve a top @d on the bidding|pg||
nt|boedhy: very interesting moment|pg||
nt|petergill: inserting @H10 is normal on a low heart, but we will see|pg||
nt|boedhy: these penalty (in soccer) moments happen a lot in Bridge thats why I like it so much|pg||
nt|vlad9:  declarer guessed right but Im not sure the play was correct|pg||
nt|vlad9:  he could lose 3 trums theseway|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This can be interesting - declarer has a choice of plays. The crossruff option has been stopped nicely by the defence and nowneed to decide how to avoid losing control|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|swanson: The @D8 discard will chinch it.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: do we know what the problem is Fiona ?|pg||
nt|snorris: takes the entry from n|pg||
nt|mcarroll: me too and when you cash AK@D to find Q dropping it is easier|pg||
pc|c8|nt|werge: bids|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|keylime: I'm swayed by what pard does admittedly. I'm use to opening light in my regular p'ship; his pass probably sways me here instead of me tabling 2@d (which is diamonds and hearts for ...|pg||
nt|keylime: us)|pg||
nt|bobholl: this looks like a safer line :)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|sunsamvar: the interesting boards are coming up. so hold on to the edge of your seats|pg||
nt|boedhy: ai he missed|pg||
nt|petergill: He played @HK to see if partner encouraged - not good enough - to get 5 tricks, a low heart was the only chance. |pg||
pc|d4|nt|allanr44: yes|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes. Not clear but should rise with @SA to make sure of contract|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|swanson: So 5 diamonds and one in each of the other suits for declarer.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it seems very anti-percentage to start with the ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|petergill: Ouch, Ou and Chan missed|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s2|nt|bobholl: nice battle for 9th trick :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: well played|pg||
nt|mcarroll: obviously not my line and now a @H makes thing difficult|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: the very fact that you are vul means that partner's top end is higher. here you would be a favorite to make game oppsite Qxxxx of hearts|pg||
nt|npcjpn: but North has to find six discard....|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|santyclz: He pitched a @d from dummy.|pg||
nt|janm: Still looks as if this is going down (only 4 diamonds, since declarer pitched one on a heart)|pg||
nt|cindy: all of my partners open anything that moves so we might miss a part score but thats ok with me|pg||
nt|sybarra: and home now |pg||
nt|boedhy: Not easy to get it right but I agree with Peter that it was probably his only change|pg||
nt|bobholl: with 52 crds open easy now|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: E opened the bidding, so it can;t be wrong to start with a D to the 9 and see what happens|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: can Peter divine the @C position?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|dT|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: Yes. He might have played trumps this way because he is 50 imps behind|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h2|nt|werge: But I do´nt understand Wests choice - he needs a solid @c-suit, so how can you make 6 NT, if 6 @c is´nt absolutely cold? And partner might even have @h K x...|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mcarroll: This is not the winning line|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bobholl: nicely played !!|pg||
nt|allanr44: if they were in 6 it would have taken longer  :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: surely :)|pg||
mc|8|nt|ahollan1: he has count in @S -- @H probably 44 or North 5 South 3|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@H has play here EW...... no Save NS|pg||
nt|bobholl: this last 3nt migth gain a lot|pg||
nt|allanr44: It will be interesting to see what happens in the other room.|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: which means, i think, that the odds on bidding are nowhere near as terrifying as has been suggested|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lol   i thought they were in 3NT. to me it looks so automatic for N to bid 3NT over 2NT that i didnt even bother to check the rest of the auction|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: not sure what problem is :) In the Cayne match|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: micheals. most use micheals for weak(below opening hand) or 16 + hands.|pg||
nt|forni: looks like 4@S by NS|pg||
nt|boedhy: this will feel Bad for Good Ball |pg||
nt|vlad9:  soon this will end in 3nt|pg||
nt|rado: @D or Majors|pg||
nt|bobh1: I like the upgrade, based on quality of hcp|pg||
nt|snorris: west will be looking for slam..|pg||
nt|snorris: but no support for @s will disdain him|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt for sure|pg||
mb|1C!|an|17+|nt|mrdct: not a great @D suit but there are 6 of them so 2@D looks OK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when able to make overcall in suit just under opening bid -- because of preemptive value, it can be weaker than other 2 level overcalls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S a practical bid -- with EW showing 8+@S partner strong favorite to have some @S length|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think gill needs to bid again with this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  EW 8+@H -- but you knew that|pg||
nt|werge: If thisd is a weak-two - this beats the world record|pg||
nt|roswolf: re|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: terrifying for me   i would bid if that outside stuff were in my long suits|pg||
nt|mrdct: even though he is red vs green|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the north hand falls in between and most wd call the suits in turn|pg||
nt|forni: but|pg||
nt|werge: Here 4 @S is making N/S with only 16 HCP|pg||
nt|forni: I'm wrong|pg||
nt|allanr44: part score here|pg||
mb|1D!|an|0-7|nt|keylime: I'd like the K@c in my diamonds. Then I'm bidding freely.|pg||
nt|forni: 3 rounds of @H will promote @SJ|pg||
nt|werge: 300 is not part score...|pg||
nt|bobholl: pass 1nt 2nt ?|pg||
nt|rado: Skorchev might risk 2NT showing some defense or 3@D simple fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: moreover, bidding VASTLY increases the chances that PARTNER will get to be on lead, which is a very good thing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would he still bid 2D if he had 250 honors?|pg||
nt|sybarra: should we pour you another glass of wine?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, pleaseeeeeeeeeeeee|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: how many votes for 3nt and how many for 4@H with the south hand ?|pg||
nt|werge: Yes, 3 rounds of H ist the killing defence - when East ruffs with the @S Jack|pg||
nt|allanr44: true Hans  :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: interesting -- when i began reading books/magazines from England "green" meant favorable vulnerability|pg||
nt|mrdct: trump lead by gill might be best - althogh he has a slight problem in that department|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  not-vul vs vu|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now that i know of other parts of the world - they use it "green" = not-vul|pg||
nt|roswolf: defence are favorite here|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: was 2H forcing by N ?|pg||
nt|keylime: I have a glass of Lake Anna Sunset currently in hand|pg||
nt|npcjpn: probably with 2@d multi, 2@h shows sound weak two. |pg||
nt|april7: 2@S partscore for NS|pg||
nt|snorris: another 25hp no game|pg||
mb|3D|nt|janm: EW will probably think that N was kidding with the 1NT bid|pg||
nt|keylime: but I wonder if they are playing IJO's|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT Precision so about 13-15 I think|pg||
nt|werge: 1 @S is a part...|pg||
nt|allanr44: hmmm|pg||
nt|werge: But no 300 now!|pg||
nt|werge: West knows, that N/S are in an 8-card-fit|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 @C losers 2@S a @D and what more ?|pg||
nt|werge: 2600|pg||
nt|vlad9:  2cl = stayman  in this position|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@s clear|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: not liking 3H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what did S think 2D was? if she couldn;t open the bidding surely she couldn;t bid 3H on a misfit, so she must have thought 2D was something else|pg||
nt|cindy: im happy defending |pg||
nt|werge: 260, I mean|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with the J in @D in finesse 3NT is safe , but the declarer don't see the cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 5@C DBL would have been 500 however N has to much defense to save|pg||

nt|boedhy: Although those boards didnt loose points but they need to get on the score board..|pg||
nt|werge: Suppose East had (had) an opening bid, you would be happy to bid and plays 3 NT now|pg||
nt|bobholl: kind of missed manche 2@S :)|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Don't know why he is using Stayman with those @S Danger of ruff in 4@H if partner fits|pg||
nt|vlad9:  spade spots are not good enough for defence|pg||
nt|snorris: probably|pg||
nt|rado: 3NT also short of trick|pg||
nt|snorris: must have shown bigger hand than 4 @s right away|pg||
pc|h5|nt|swanson: Unsupported aces are not often good leads, but here there is a reasonable chance that either the king is in dummy or that North can give partner a ruff.|pg||
nt|santyclz: @c continuation makes this very tough if possible at all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H before touching trump to ensure 2 or 3 ruffs in dummy|pg||
nt|werge: 3 NT and 5 @C both should make|pg||
nt|allanr44: yep|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrdct: west probably not keen on playing a trump from Qxx now|pg||
nt|mrdct: all very much looking like an easy make now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now play is just for overtrick|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|keylime: pushes as expected on boards 1 and 2 hence the no score.|pg||
nt|sybarra: esp. when I know what to lead |pg||
nt|ahollan1: mid @S looks automatic -- if Gill follows suit, no harm|pg||
nt|forni: Ohno will take the lead by ending in 4@S on board 14, where Gill went down one in 5@S|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petergill: A club back works best, but a diamond back is more likely. |pg||
nt|petergill: Shen deliberately lost the club into the safe hand who cannot attack @H profitably|pg||
nt|boedhy: the only board were they think they will win points 3NT -3 will loose 3 because of their partners being in 5@d (not doubled luckly enough) minus 4|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes nice early club play to non dangerous opp|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT will make - declarer will double-finesse in spades later, if he has to |pg||
nt|petergill: For me, it's nice to see Mr Yeh's team winning, because I played in the Yeh Cup (sponsored and run by Mr Yeh, US$165,000 prizemoney) last month - most of the participants would ...|pg||
nt|petergill: agree that iti s probably the best event in the world to play in. |pg||
nt|boedhy: but wonders happen they won an imp on the last board partners were in 3NT also normal contract I suppose...........And made an uptrick with the @h lead...............|pg||
nt|vlad9:  uff - this lead means pd - I heard you but I dont care|pg||
nt|2hplus4: A @C lead is hoping for a miracle Partner has the points and he said lead a @S|pg||
nt|snorris: but east has nothing extra|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugrapha3: some music started playing outside so play stopped :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: diamonds are forever :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Ou likes to think things through. Not many clues about what to play next. |pg||
pc|h6|nt|cindy: 3/2 diamonds makes it easy|pg||
nt|bobholl: 8 tricks now but no more|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|keylime: I asked Larry, who's my regular pard about the 5-5 red hand, he states he's coming in due to decent loser count. Ironically, he's more conservative than I am most of the time. :-)|pg||
nt|cindy: would anyone lead the K of hearts with W hand ?|pg||
nt|april7: only 8 tricks, discard of 1 @D from each hand only|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mariner1: now a @c and defense prevails|pg||
nt|petergill: Nice card, @C7, correctly won by @CK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4 rounds of @c will help W to get a count on N. and see that he has at least 6 red cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the first trick are well played|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: if nobody is dancing -- it doesn't count|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: keep the dangerous east out|pg||
nt|werge: Why the 10 of @H?|pg||
nt|vlad9:  I dont like the Q of spades by declarer eighter  - one entry to dummy is wasted|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sunsamvar: once the @S king was seen with east he can be sure that the @C top honours are with west..|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S buys a dummy for 3H that is about two tricks better than par on this auction|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so good safety play|pg||
pc|c7|nt|2hplus4: @H9 suggests he wants this deal over quickly|pg||
nt|rado: knowing agressive style of Popov/Andonov at other room probably same contract|pg||
pc|cT|nt|petergill: now for the spade finesses|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|keylime: B3: 4@h got doubled and racked for 690|pg||
nt|cindy: yep|pg||
nt|keylime: I wonder if North was catering to South's somewhat yo-yo tendencies|pg||
nt|marlowepi: oy-oy tendencies?|pg||
nt|cindy: :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: i dont think yamada has the timing for a trump coup here|pg||
nt|werge: By the way we are informed, that East showed 8-11 HCP|pg||

nt|allanr44: 9 now|pg||

nt|marlowepi: did you ask curly?|pg||
nt|keylime: did declarer really duck there?|pg||
nt|mrdct: one entry short|pg||
pc|c6|nt|roswolf: hmm a chance for declarer|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mariner1: good defense will score here|pg||
nt|swanson: THe opening bid and raise by East was somewhere in the 'weak' to 'pitiful' category so he should be surprised to be taking a minus score.|pg||
nt|swanson: should not be|pg||
nt|mariner1: we move again now........ 3 board rounds|pg||
nt|nickf: I suppose EW will move to NS here|pg||
nt|mariner1: so it looks like our EW become NS each round|pg||
nt|swanson: Matheson-Cormack had only one below par result in the six boards we saw, board 4 and that should be only a bit below average.  Good start for them.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Two ladies have just sat down now.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|werge: I repeat: With the West hand - after the bidding by N/S - you must bid GAME!|pg||
pc|d7|nt|boedhy: The YEh cup that is|pg||

mb|2S|an|sp+m|nt|vugrapha3: yes|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: The Irish and Americans have been having a few parties :)|pg||

nt|april7: 4@H dohn on @D lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: in the open room, 6NT was made, so new leader.|pg||
nt|werge: A quiet on here - 600 at both tables|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: important for South to not overly press due to the potential 10 imp loss|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 2 @h forcing and nat ?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 2@H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: @h and a minor |pg||
mb|d|nt|mrdct: possible tricky @S contract for EW here|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: What was so special in the Yeh Cup Peter apart from the generous prize money ?|pg||
nt|werge: But it´s hard work|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Certainly has that!|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: at least 55 5-10 points|pg||
nt|roswolf: here 3nt looks normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Americans partying cause summer in OZ|pg||
nt|mrdct: right-sided now|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: major suit battle developing here|pg||
nt|npcjpn: after a @H lead from South.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: On Board 3 the open also got to the no hope slam|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah, in fact they kept on bidding and NS are now in 7@H Dbl so a big swing coming|pg||
mb|3H!|an|positive|nt|ahollan1: 2@S guarantees 4-card support  [DBL=3@S]|pg||
nt|mrdct: i was up there for the Yeh Cup and can certainly attest to the fact that the Amercian bridge players know how to party|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: both 4  @H and 4@S makes although there are only 18 total tricks as per the LAW|pg||
nt|boedhy: top attendance, top accomodation|pg||
nt|petergill: The defence to beat 5@D = @h ruff - is not easy to find. |pg||
nt|boedhy: he told me but Peter was there|pg||
mb|3S|nt|janm: Weak NT and 3NT on the strength of the good diamond suit|pg||
nt|swanson: This will work out very well for N-S.  Unlucky for East to not be able to enter the auction.|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to guess to cash @D to make this|pg||
nt|mariner1: interestingly any card from dummy works here|pg||
nt|werge: The 9th trick shall come from the @C-auit...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: very deep position to play E for 4 diamonds, which was obviously the plan from the getgo. it is not as if W bid 3S. anyway if she was thinking about that deep play, maybe she ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: should cash heart ace first just in case something interesting happens. when king falls, she can cash other top trump then ruff spade|pg||
nt|keylime: I think once the K@h falls under the ace, 4-1 trumps becomes more unlikely|pg||
nt|forni: hrm... this isn't the right contract.|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - 8 easy tricks...!|pg||
nt|snorris: east is cosious|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Assuming S goes right in diamonds, which seems likely, this will be a great result for NS - not only bidding & making 3NT but an overtrick because of the lead|pg||
nt|swanson: Not finessing has the disadvantage of losing the remainder of the daimond tricks should Qxx be onside - but after the opponents run clubs there woudln't be many diamond tricks to ...|pg||
nt|swanson: take anyway.|pg||
nt|sybarra: how do "we"  (e/w) land in clubs?|pg||
nt|keylime: I think the club suit's been lost for 20 years Shirley...or more|pg||
nt|sybarra: or do they need to |pg||
nt|cindy: not by bidding 2S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think they better stay where they are|pg||
nt|cindy: i cant relate|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Bakkeren in the tank again|pg||
nt|sybarra: had several suggestion, of X with E  IF  east is going to bid|pg||
nt|npcjpn: after a strength showing redouble, direct 2@h shows (sub)-minimum opening.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: tough situation for Ish.|pg||
nt|2hplus4: May give declarer the information to make his contract though|pg||
nt|snorris: njot anymore|pg||
nt|rado: 2@D usually INV+ realy but sometimes weak hand with @c fit|pg||
nt|bobh1: if W manages to pass this could be a big pickup|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: dont understand the tank either|pg||
nt|sybarra: tank=thinking|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@S looks quite managable - but with some skillful play 4@S is a chance here despite the 4-1 break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: selling out when opp known to hold 8@S may convince Gill that trump are 41|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D was freely bid, hence 5@D|pg||
nt|boedhy: Played from the west side it is virtually impossible |pg||
nt|snorris: 1000|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: I don't think you can cash two clubs tho after the K@h falls|pg||
nt|mrdct: "skillful" in this case means picking where the @SQ is|pg||
nt|petergill: Spotlight is on Ou's lead - again|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @s lead will pressurise declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: @HK is not impossible - EW figure to have very few clubs. |pg||
nt|boedhy: He will not underlead his ace even if he would have read Lawrence books :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: ;0|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: :)|pg||
nt|snorris: and its quit natural lead from south|pg||
pc|sK|nt|keylime: to get some information about how trumps might be breaking|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably this is rock-bottom for the 2NT range|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double with only one defensive trick understandably did not appeal to E|pg||
nt|cindy: i know   what could he be thinking about|pg||
nt|sybarra: what in the "h!@@@@  |pg||
nt|sybarra: pard has|pg||
nt|sybarra: to be bidding|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @C LEAD|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: otherwise it makes i think|pg||
nt|forni: "normally", s would open 1@C and N would bid 1NT over west's overcall.|pg||
nt|petergill: sorry, I forgot it was North on lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mariner1: over tricks really count in MP however they don't hurt in Imps Across the Field either|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, he was thinking about NT. he does have an opening hand with a fit and  3 stoppers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL + pass of 2@S must put Q in North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- "must" is a 4-letter word|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: " twenty minutes left"|pg||
nt|2hplus4: It's dangerous when you don't win the auction after making a 2 suited bid|pg||
nt|werge: + the @C Queen|pg||
nt|bobh1: i like defending with 4333|pg||
pc|s5|nt|werge: West shall false-card with the @h 9 - South might finesse East for the Jack|pg||
nt|forni: "the end"|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|cindy: his partner couldnt bid over 1N|pg||
nt|keylime: I'm surprised that a double didn't come flying out from West here|pg||
nt|mrdct: he probably wont try to set up @C before drawing trumps given that he's only in 2@S|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: NOW EASY|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: sry for caps|pg||
nt|boedhy: still has to do some work...small @d will work best now|pg||
nt|werge: It seems, that a @H-lead kills 3 NT|pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: well that lead helps!|pg||
nt|werge: Go for @S-trick as number 9|pg||
pc|d4|nt|keylime: pard balanced red on white|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: I think W just happy to be defending |pg||
nt|cindy: my head is spinning|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: u need an exorcist|pg||
nt|sybarra: you are right on that Dwayne|pg||
nt|sybarra: but knowing the dutch as I do, they balance on air,  so that is why W in the tank no doubt|pg||
nt|petergill: Need to draw trumps, then carefully lead thrice towards @HQJ10x - entries to West hand are a problem. |pg||
nt|boedhy: thought the same but needed to play high @d for that not low......|pg||
nt|petergill: South wins first heart, North ducks 2nd heart, the play is very interesting|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: indeed|pg||
nt|petergill: Need to play a heart right now I think in order to make it!|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, a low @d instead of @DQ would have been more revealing - when @DK pops up, it must be singleton, making an early heart play without drawing the last trump safe!|pg||
nt|petergill: Need to lead towards @HQJ10x three times so need to play a heart now - else one entry short.  |pg||
nt|petergill: A World Champion might get this right - mere mortals would draw the last trump and fail. |pg||
nt|petergill: A great hand, this one|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: establish the side suit when there is work to be done they say...|pg||
nt|werge: @S 4-2 is better than @H 3-3|pg||
nt|kapitanski: pair aronov-stefanov was eroupean champions  before 2 years (from Antalia-Turkey)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the only way to guess J in @c |pg||
pc|h3|nt|keylime: declarer doesn't know about the friendly spade layout either|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it would seem more promising to lead a low diamond at trick 2|pg||
nt|allanr44: It looks like he'll have to play for a favourable diamond lie now|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|janm: Oops|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh well|pg||
nt|keylime: I think West has to smack the 3@h counterbalance here to teach a lesson|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well there is a block in @D|pg||
nt|werge: @D to the 10 - and small (and fast)from West|pg||
nt|allanr44: this is now very tough|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and this hand is a geat example|pg||
nt|werge: The they get 9 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: Then|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: W should have ducked that D trick|pg||
nt|petergill: Wow - great play!|pg||
nt|werge: Declarer must play in the right order to make this|pg||
nt|werge: As the cards lie, best is to take in hand - and duck a @s to South, North must go in with the @S King|pg||
nt|roswolf: is there a right order? i think declarer may not be able to cash safely|pg||
nt|werge: No - not safely, but best chance|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok|pg||
pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: who knows, maybe declarer will return to hand & play another D|pg||

nt|mcarroll: No such luck this time|pg||

nt|petergill: Superb declarer play by Mr Shih - no wonder he won the World Championship last year in Beijing (the Transnational Mixed Teams, in the winning Yeh Bros Team).|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sunsamvar: east must take @Dk and shift to @C w/o cashing the spade|pg||

pc|d6|nt|werge: Please change the two 2´s...|pg||

nt|forni: trouble now.|pg||
nt|forni: W lead his smallest spade, probably 4th best...|pg||
nt|forni: so Peake was looking for the segging trick.|pg||

nt|petergill: A great example of the need to stop and think before drawing all the trumps!|pg||

nt|davidstern: Probably feels safe having passed - usually a good excuse when things go badly|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|roswolf: no but the stronger team has to try and push the opps around in view of the handicap|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no way to beat - but Dbl and Dbl again is a big risk - probably searching a swing knowing to be back |pg||
nt|davidstern: The diamond loser is going bye bye|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In that case Why not 2! instead of D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@d|pg||
nt|davidstern: On an allocation basis I make it 110% North -10% South|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol|pg||
nt|davidstern: But I do think South should bid - Unlikely to beat it opposite passed partner|pg||
nt|davidstern: swap the @HK and @CK and they are looking OK for close to 4|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i thougth South would bid 2Nt|pg||

nt|daman: hard to believe NS bid that way|pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably misread the situation with @hAQ10 and a rather good @s|pg||
pc|sA|nt|davidstern: I would have bid 1NT over 1@S as takeout and left it there|pg||

nt|mariner1: one reason you "MIGHT" hook is shooting for a big score against the field......|pg||
nt|santyclz: May save a few mps.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the other point is this--if you plkay a very aggressive style, as the dutch do, and iuf both partners want to keep palying it, then you simply have to give a lot more leeway & let ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some of the doubles get away from you|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Ohno 4 more ims on 16|pg||
nt|mrdct: so that board is potential gain for ohno if thay bid game next door|pg||
nt|ahollan1: contract was ok at that point - could ruff in dummy exit with loser and still have trump KJ intact|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: as the @s ruff provides the back entry for the @DA and club discard|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: he is ok becos @C lenght is on his left|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: ok back to 18 now :)|pg||
nt|npcjpn: nine tricks for both sides.|pg||

nt|boedhy: yes well done|pg||
nt|petergill: Bye everyone, I have to go.|pg||
nt|bobholl: pity but both wouldn't work|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Declarer misguessed trumps in 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: seems that way |pg||
nt|rado: 1@D - dbl now|pg||
nt|snorris: 20-20|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The big lead is being eroded!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|npcjpn: NS playing weak notrump. but this North hand is too strong for strong notrump.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: screens are up :)|pg||
nt|forni: sound-proof screens? Or did Peake hear Gill screaming?|pg||
nt|snorris: pas all around..?|pg||
nt|bobh1: N must open playing strong @c|pg||
nt|snorris: I dont like opening any of these hands|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: there they go again bidding opps suit :)|pg||
nt|werge: Seems to be a weak opening|pg||
nt|forni: very|pg||
nt|forni: but|pg||
nt|forni: as the cards lie... 4@H makes.|pg||
nt|werge: Not on a trump leas - and more of them|pg||
nt|werge: lead|pg||
nt|forni: unless NS decide to lead trump|pg||
nt|forni: hehe|pg||
mb|2C|nt|swanson: 3NT was anti-field - I believe one should just take their best shot to make the contract in that situation.|pg||
nt|janm: Doesn't seem as if "field" was too likely to be relevant - they were in a fairly anti-field contract, unless weak NT is more common in this field than most?|pg||
nt|mrdct: 9 tricks on top in 3NT|pg||
nt|snorris: how many @ds?|pg||
nt|snorris: 4|pg||
nt|snorris: maybe 5?|pg||
nt|snorris: I like 5..|pg||
nt|april7: even 6 because of discard of @H loser on 5th @D|pg||
nt|kapitanski: yesterday  Ireland - Bulgaria  1-1  Martin  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: here most people would bid 2H as S, showing INV + in clubs|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: and 5 more on 17|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are a million things that can go wrong, in the layout or in the defence. after all, if you had clearly misdefended two games already (as W did in the first set), would you be ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so quick to double?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 5 boards to go here|pg||
nt|werge: We are back to 9 tricks each way|pg||
nt|bobholl: will he beleive that a double works now :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: eau de cologne 4711 play in 7 card suit|pg||
nt|april7: 5th @C ofcourse|pg||
nt|snorris: now what west?|pg||
nt|april7: I mean 6@S b E|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mariner1: well in Oz with transfer openers and bids its hard to tell :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously NS have had 2 hands too strong and zero that fit (11)12-14 opener or 15-17 rebid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will they rech the good 6@C here ?|pg||
nt|snorris: double: some ponts..?|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Pass first|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: honours lying badly for declarer and that dooms the good 5@C contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: not uncommon|pg||
nt|keylime: South might like her hand a lot now|pg||
nt|npcjpn: very cautios pass by Green.|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Has W run out of Pass cards?|pg||
nt|vlad9:  3he puts pressure on S|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: there are some as far as a can see :)|pg||
nt|werge: Easy 4 @s here - to play, not to bid|pg||
nt|kapitanski: a tence moment in the begining i think|pg||
nt|snorris: probably going down|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I know - and we were lucky to get a draw!|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: was 1S-1NT-P 2S-2S-3H|pg||
nt|cindy: not that much i guess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this hand shows the power of shape and aces, NS making 6C with only 22 working HCP|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: she passed very quickly|pg||
nt|npcjpn: if West's minor reversed...|pg||
nt|werge: West should be declarer - trump lead is more difficult for Nortth than for Souht|pg||
nt|forni: true|pg||
nt|forni: but they're not in game, so it really doesn't matter anymore. Too bad, could've used some more exitement|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: he has handled it well|pg||
nt|2hplus4: It puts pressure on partner too :)|pg||
nt|snorris: points|pg||
nt|april7: neg.?:):)|pg||
nt|rado: "old fashioned" longest and strongest|pg||
pc|dK|nt|nickf: but mandatory in NZ where I think they come from|pg||
nt|janm: I think we're one player off here - N opened 1@s|pg||
nt|nickf: Ally, undo the auction|pg||
nt|swanson: Aren't we off by 90 degrees in the bidding here?|pg||
nt|werge: I go for coffie here|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreedhans|pg||
nt|kapitanski: was  good  match!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Not for me!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: can they get to 6@D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duck once -- let Horwitz find correct pointed [@S/@D] shift|pg||
nt|allanr44: something stronger  :)|pg||
nt|werge: But only after the lead|pg||
pc|d8|nt|snorris: it automaticly becomes negative in a way|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: just kidding ....:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stripe-tailed ape in passout seat|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely 2 @D was inverted |pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am guessing yes. E will like his aces and W will like his trumps and controls|pg||
nt|sybarra: I.e.  =good hand|pg||
nt|keylime: I think you get there once you hear the spade ace|pg||
nt|sybarra: is that inverted?  I should have looked closer |pg||
nt|werge: Nor 4 @D-.tricks possible|pg||
nt|forni: he'll have to play the @D for 4 tricks to make game|pg||
nt|forni: duck a club now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: i assumed it was a simple raise|pg||
nt|mrdct: should make 10 tricks now as the @S finesse is safe|pg||
nt|npcjpn: will shift to spades, I guess.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if K is strong lead -- then Gill has a) denied @HJ  and b) shown doubleton |pg||
nt|bobholl: werge coffee is english koffie is dutch don't mix them up :)|pg||
nt|kapitanski: in  fact they  all play  very  fast...in  normal case|pg||
nt|roswolf: quantum seem to be picking up the small gains - their n/s in the other room are having a good set|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I hate it when we get an early goal and then try to fefend the lead|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This 4@S should go doewn|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|werge: I see no alternative to the @s-swith|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like -1. 3nt is makeable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no 4@h is on ice|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Oh dear. I hate to see bidding like that rewarded|pg||
nt|april7: E was not willing to bid @S ,2 down only and a good save|pg||
nt|rado: S missed vital entry for checking Q @H good|pg||
nt|kapitanski: unlucky  game  here  |pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: now can duck @D for squeeze that doesn't materialize|pg||
nt|werge: switch|pg||
nt|roswolf: he found one!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes |pg||
pc|d2|nt|werge: café au lait|pg||
nt|snorris: yes|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rado: luckily A@S in dummy to play @C|pg||
nt|snorris: yes has a chanse.. if he guesses @ds|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|keylime: declarer will be happy about the 3-0 spade break with the A@c safely tucked away|pg||
nt|keylime: club break I meant|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i don;t think so.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: declarer would probably prefer for 6 not to be cold|pg||
nt|keylime: quite true. |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: and taaaaaaaaadaaaaaaaaaa|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N is lucky that @sQ is singleton|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes and that all his @S spots work|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But he has communication problems, so it must be a careful play|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: whatever the bids meant,  wd to e/w |pg||
nt|snorris: afterwards|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are many players who would upgrade the W hand due to the long suit and open 2NT. this hand is an excellent example of why that is so wrong. 2NT openers are slam-killers. here ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E woiuldn;t dream of slam in a million years over 2NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this hand also shows some of the weakness of the point-count. with only 19 HCP, W actually has a better hand in a sense than a 2NT opener because of the long suit and the controls|pg||
nt|cindy: crashed :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this match might now be about even when these last two are compared|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome back|pg||
nt|cindy: ty|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what woke you?|pg||
nt|vlad9:  I wonder what should S have in N opinion to make a game opposite 3di nonforcing bid by S|pg||
nt|rado: so down 3 for 500|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mariner1: good cash for the defense here|pg||
nt|mrdct: might duck a @S now to set up a potential red suit squeeze on west|pg||
nt|allanr44: schnapps?|pg||
nt|bobholl: oops|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Board 3 was a 14 imp swing so now the lead is looking insurmountable - especially as the momemtum is with the leaders|pg||
pc|s8|nt|werge: Do´nt be surprisde, this will be one down...|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|werge: Had´nt East showed allready a lot of HCP? - why not the right @C-guess?|pg||
nt|snorris: d@d lead now of course seals it|pg||
nt|snorris: for the defence|pg||
nt|rado: @h return breaks communications too|pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|rado: Yujna zona|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|keylime: declarer will probably play a@h, heart ruff A@d, diamond ruff, heart ruff|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mrdct: @D i mean|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: but i think most would have lead @HQ for unblock or count |pg||

nt|bobholl: 4 tricks ns missed 800 opportunity :)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now with the bad break in @D he is down even if the @Ha was favourable|pg||
nt|forni: ruffing a @C would mean 9 tricks|pg||

nt|mrdct: and has improved her bridge significantly during that period|pg||

nt|vugraphzku: a few minutes break is starting now|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: the players will be back in awhile|pg||
nt|vlad9:  kqxxxx  di and 2 aces would be sufficient to make 5 di|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: we are resuming the play|pg||
nt|werge: Good with this 11th trick - which "proves", that N/S missed a game|pg||
nt|kapitanski: both players  in  2  rooms are  in the same generation  -  around 40 years  old  even  Skorchev and Ignatov (they are very  yang)|pg||

nt|snorris: 3 @h vs 31S|pg||

nt|snorris: 3@s|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugrapha3: short break|pg||

nt|werge: When I started playing bridge, South did NOT have an opening hand...|pg||

nt|bobh1: the match is getting a little tighter|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D with A A is strange|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes more like a 1@D opening for me|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Does anyone of you open with 3@d on N? In my opinion too short @d and too many aces|pg||
mb|1S|nt|janm: I'm not sure whether the 1NT is strong, and N upgraded, or weak and N decided it wasn't worth more than 1NT - I'll bet the former, though|pg||

nt|snorris: 2 @c..?|pg||
nt|bobh1: somebody said something about xfers in comp|pg||
nt|snorris: showing some @ds?|pg||
nt|rado: 2@C showing @H and non-bal hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@S is makeable here|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mrdct: nobody plays anything natural over a 1@C opening these days|pg||
nt|werge: Can West stay out of game - 14 HCP facing an opening hand...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I can see that you already have agreed|pg||
nt|bridge_one: So nobody of us would open 3@D :) but here worked (E/W can make 4@h without lead in @H)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 1 or 2 down?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mariner1: weak NT allows the auction to be jacked up quick again|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lovely position for w to be in vul vs not.|pg||
nt|keylime: B6 in the open room now|pg||
nt|snorris: no|pg||
nt|mcarroll: but difficult to bid|pg||
mb|4S|nt|swanson: I think a trump lead is necessary here to stop game in spades.|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS should score well here|pg||
nt|swanson: BUt, of course, you first have to enter the auction.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H has play, so a make is really big her|pg||
nt|mariner1: here|pg||
nt|keylime: 2@d looks to be the Multi here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my bet -- Fiona misclick    1N-P-2@C puppet to 2@D makes more sense|pg||
nt|mrdct: the 1@C opening might include weak NT hands|pg||
nt|npcjpn: yes, AL, after 1NT opening, thier 2@c is puppet to 2@d.|pg||
nt|allanr44: that was 10 imps I'd imagine|pg||
nt|2hplus4: this could be costly I'd XX as West|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: S trying to win some imps back|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @hs is much bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: ok, will see board eight later.|pg||
nt|forni: there we go, more trouble for the Aussies|pg||
nt|bobholl: what could west win with cover ?|pg||
nt|allanr44: you've got me ...|pg||
nt|werge: 10 doubleton by East|pg||
nt|bobh1: N apparently really likes his 12-count|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2 down |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: they have missed 18 :) |pg||
nt|werge: That´s the price for East double|pg||
nt|werge: East´s|pg||
nt|roswolf: imo east putting his head on the block|pg||
nt|roswolf: but rescued by south|pg||
nt|snorris: blodbath..|pg||
nt|rado: quiet 9 tricks on lead for EW :)|pg||
nt|april7: EW will take first 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: usually start of a sign-off in a suit.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: one or three club opening?|pg||
nt|werge: This can´t be the bidding - 4 @c from West!?!|pg||
nt|npcjpn: looks normal if the opening bid was 3@c|pg||
nt|werge: Sure|pg||
nt|forni: NS will be able to take the first 6 tricks.|pg||
nt|allanr44: with K75 I have no idea|pg||
nt|werge: But that only would avoid the overtrick|pg||
pc|hT|nt|swanson: One reason that West could consider 4@S is that partner will have at most a singleton heart on the auction.|pg||
nt|werge: Play low - West will not dare playing the @S King...|pg||
nt|werge: Back to the good old days - where double was for the money - 500?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: they obviously had no difficulty|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bobholl: a trick missing in all colours |pg||
nt|bobholl: may be @D disappearing on @S|pg||
nt|2hplus4: That'll strike fear into declarer's heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: W was thinking of redoubling but decided it was better not to having in mind the score ;) |pg||
nt|roswolf: blood will flow|pg||
nt|werge: Best defence is difficult, take the 2 @D-tricks and play 4 x @C|pg||
nt|rado: favourable vuln 3@H is pre, having 2@Sque available for "points" raise|pg||
nt|snorris: ok|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: maybe 1 nt would have been better? |pg||
nt|sybarra: easy from here |pg||
nt|cindy: 2H seems auto to me with N hand|pg||
nt|boedhy: well that was a great bidding performance |pg||
nt|allanr44: i doubt it|pg||
nt|bobh1: 3@h kind of stole the hand|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is another option |pg||
nt|boedhy: ther are really having a good set Shih and Shen|pg||
pc|h9|nt|swanson: Still, there is that dark red on the boards looking at West.|pg||
nt|boedhy: sorry Sunil but I have to leave also have fun|pg||
nt|boedhy: and spectators too offcourse|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: bye Ruud|pg||
pc|h8|nt|marlowepi: i think i understand the bidding through 1S after that i am lost|pg||
nt|cindy: agree|pg||
nt|keylime: I would have bid 1NT, if not, honor-9 isn't bad for 2@h|pg||
nt|mrdct: this is a pretty handy start to the match for Horwitz|pg||
nt|werge: 130 in silence|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|werge: Here we are...!|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|allanr44: yep|pg||
pc|sA|nt|keylime: and 10 more imps for 3NT making 4 on B6 for Melbourne|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember - this is just 1st of 4 10-board sets|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board for this set -- next scheduled to begin in  25 minutes, but everything running late today, so who knows|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will we get it back ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't think this is coreect|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c4|nt|cindy: S doesnt like to pass|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Safety play|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Set up @Hs and play W for @S A|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bobholl: correct|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C trumped now will let contract be made :)|pg||
nt|snorris: west making it easy form pd|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bobholl: unless S throws a @S|pg||
nt|snorris: -1 though probably|pg||
nt|rado: W must return trump seems....|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bobholl: or playes @D now :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now it more looks like -3|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: yes so far nobody had commented on the reopening double|pg||
nt|werge: claim|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w are very good defenders|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: and "flopping the @H suit)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: cross ruff to 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|forni: I think Gill tried to create a big swing|pg||
pc|dK|nt|werge: I see!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|santyclz: Forgot to lead a @d.|pg||
nt|janm: I think a diamond from West would have beaten this - declarer couldn't get off dummy|pg||
nt|keylime: I would have if possible, rebid 1NT but that may indicate a better hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: EW would be playing 1S against me|pg||
nt|cindy: i was trying to think of something nice to say|pg||
nt|sybarra: cant be but so good,  N was a passed hand|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i lost the play...|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: sorry for this ...|pg||
nt|cindy: and couldnt make neg dbl or bid 1N or raise hearts or anything over 1S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bobholl: won't make now|pg||
nt|werge: @C 7!!!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: or even worse!|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk4: Werlcome to Liliek from Indonesia|pg||
nt|roswolf: still booked for -3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|swanson: West missed a chance to lock declarer in hand and would have set the contract (aftger ruffing the club)|pg||
nt|swanson: in dummy|pg||
nt|janm: Guess the diamond suit was interesting here after all - declarer has to decide whether to pitch a club, playing for the diamond Q onside or whether to pitch a diamond and give up a ...|pg||
nt|janm: club, going down 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has an awful suit, no real support for any other suit, N is a passed hand, NS are vul, NS have no game, and essentially S has a defensive hand. i wouldn;t dream of reopening ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: under those circumstyances, or even HALF of those circumstances|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sunsamvar: i think it was safer to take the @Sa on 1st trick.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|janm: He's going for the make|pg||
mc|10|nt|swanson: West could save time and concede.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: four inevitable losers now.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well done again by Shin.|pg||
nt|westjava: hi sunil,hi all|pg||
pg||

nt|bridge_one: 4@S was made bec West returned @C after the trick with K in @s|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3NT EW|pg||
nt|ralfwil: you mean sharpen your self confidence?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes, two more segments of 16 boards Monday next week|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|davidstern: So they are down 2 IMPS a board which is not insurmountable|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: In the meantime David will have switched to daylight saving|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: an invite?|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: dont laugh Roland - we have an extra week of Daylight Saving but everything I have that is connected to the web - and trust me that is plenty  - assumed it happened last weekend|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2nt with 10 and a 5-card suit?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Many people missed flights etc because their phones went back one hou|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ant A T in the five suit |pg||
pc|c2|nt|davidstern: Wonder why EW stopped in 2NT with a combined 25|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's opposite 14-16, but I guess most would have raised to game instead of inviting|pg||
nt|roswolf: they have the 99 imps handicap + which explains a lot|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s2|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|davidstern: No safety play in diamonds|pg||
nt|bridge_one: lead @S was more difficult to play 3Nt - Was make bec Q@C in finesse and North without QJ in @D|pg||
nt|davidstern: Which also tells me something|pg||

nt|daman: seems a bit timid when you are an underdog|pg||
nt|vugraphzky: yes, Karlsson is as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzky: and hes not sleeping|pg||
nt|Walddk2: After trick 1 he knew he wasn't going to beat 2NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Erik we advise that Karlsson is a thinking-man|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So why the huddle I wonder|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h3|nt|daman: not the discard that hurt|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||

nt|marlowepi: the Melbourne team is amassing a big lead, but in baseball parlance they are all "unearned runs", i.,e. unforced errors by the other team. |pg||
nt|cindy: me either|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 12 imps for the slam|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: saving time with the intention of hitting the beach i suppose :)|pg||
nt|npcjpn: last board of the set.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: ten boards more.|pg||
nt|forni: unfortunately, it costs him 8 imps|pg||
nt|westjava: sry,late:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice try but no result|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't think S should have doubled. He knew somebody did not have their bid|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't mind the 1@S opener especially at the score|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Friede from Germany|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello all.|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Hello there|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: hi Friede |pg||
nt|snorris: better than 3 @h|pg||
nt|snorris: good result n-s , 3@c is on e-w|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In tennis this is called unforced errors|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: I think they may win the event|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: You are just in time cause I have to leave soon :)|pg||
nt|westjava: to leave me alone...?:)|pg||
nt|werge: 6 @S played by the "right" hand|pg||
nt|snorris: only 2 @h now|pg||
nt|april7: 2@H for EW|pg||
nt|rado: 2@H expected|pg||
mb|p|nt|forni: Horwitz did very well in the swiss, but this isn't great bridge what they're showing.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|westjava: btw,what system they are using,Sunil?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3 of my teammates are waiting for me to join them at the bridge club..|pg||
nt|westjava: ok,npp|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: thogh i wud very much like to stay and watch this great match.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Possible @d slam for N/S here.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I would just punt 3NT|pg||
nt|2hplus4: At least he has bid his suit this time. Needs a @C lead to stop slam I think|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@H here for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: i must say Fiona that I had a roaring time in the Gold Coast a few years ago.|pg||
nt|werge: Is 4 @S better than 4 @H here - I thionk so|pg||
nt|werge: think|pg||
nt|bobholl: precision has difficulties with 1@D|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: much need 12 imps |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: its my favourite tourney of the year :) so much fun|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Not that they are likely to bid it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But of course EW are not going to make it easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in the other match  Cayne leads 22-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW need to be careful here..... can get too high|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Sorry everyone. Power issues with the laptop :(|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: by the way the Indian selection trials also witnessed high drama |pg||
nt|westjava: 1@C alerting for precision?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the match finished even after a 80 board final|pg||
nt|rado: and Smay protect with DBL|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: 1nt everybody's rebid?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @S=transfer to 1 nt |pg||
nt|sybarra: (my guess)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the sun, the san, the adventures at seaworld, the night life.. had a ball|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: oh i was on holiday and not playing bridge :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: it is getting a lot of international interest especially with the Yeh Brothers being held here this year|pg||
nt|roswolf: but "only" game likely to be bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here slam is ON with @c 3/3 and finesse in @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and @h from the top....|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and @h 3/3 !|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cindy: what now ?|pg||
nt|keylime: 3@s is a misstatement of the hand|pg||
nt|cindy: N put S on the spot|pg||
nt|keylime: 3@d as well|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D or 3H, depending on agreements|pg||
nt|april7: in pairs only|pg||
nt|snorris: south is thin..|pg||
nt|snorris: lots of loosers..|pg||
nt|snorris: I wouldnt|pg||
nt|rado: another off-shape NT but good contraCT REACHED|pg||
nt|snorris: north not tempted to invite..|pg||
nt|bobh1: surprising to me that N did not try for game|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|npcjpn: in the open room, after declarer found trumps break, he took a safety play in diamonds, cashing ace first.|pg||
nt|snorris: north might have doubled if good with 4 @s so no bid for me in s|pg||
nt|snorris: I would have|pg||
nt|bobh1: game is decent|pg||
nt|rado: 8-9 tricks normall 10th hard|pg||
nt|bobh1: worth bidding red at imps|pg||
pc|hK|nt|npcjpn: many thanks to our great operator.|pg||
nt|westjava: nice math|pg||
nt|bobholl: will N bid 3 ! S ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not sure why Valkanov hasn't bid 3NT long time ago|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He is way behind, and all he needs is an ace and @DK onside|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|cindy: N should just bid 3N|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 2 boards to go after this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have power issues too - but more organic|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and in the 4 board playoff Formidables beat Texans|pg||
nt|westjava: wow!|pg||
nt|werge: @D 9 is my lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm west goes on|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sunsamvar: yes E/W play precision Liliek|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mariner1: now I would not find 1N here|pg||
nt|swanson: E-W should find 4@H and make on a crossruff.  Declarer will need to ruff the third club high to avoid an overruff.|pg||
nt|mariner1: no|pg||
nt|keylime: with 4333 I am heading straight to 3NT once 2@h hits the table as a choice of game|pg||
nt|npcjpn: no double by South?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Gábor Szöts from Hungary|pg||
nt|bobholl: yuo can't cope with @H 41 so forget about that :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Even @c lead won't set slam; declarer can finesse in @s, cash king and get back to Ace@s with @d. he just must not pull all trumps first|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2 way checkback ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: covers any 3-3 or Jx|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no|pg||
pc|h9|nt|janm: I think it depends whether EW are playing weak or strong NT. If weak, this is reasonable - treating the hand as a strong NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: That should solve the ruff problem.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: and South really passed?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: bidding not acurate. I missed the auction sorry|pg||
nt|forni: ...|pg||
nt|forni: I'm not sure what I want to say|pg||
nt|cicus: hi all|pg||
nt|bobholl: he did and obviously forcing why otherwise a slam try from S|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would lie an ace in N :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: It looks to me NS pair is in some kind of a knock-down|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How do you get back to dummy, Friede?|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: they had some quarrels about previous boards|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i bet not actual auction - Fiona entered just to catch up|pg||
nt|npcjpn: and many thanks to organizer and kibitzers.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Gabor|pg||
nt|baldfriede: cassh A@d and then lead low @d to dummy|pg||
nt|2hplus4: How does he get to dummy for @S finesse?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But you have not taken the finesse yet|pg||
nt|roswolf: should east bid 1 more?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: well, i don;t think it is clear at all. the right contract could easily be 5D, 6D, 3NT, 4S, etc.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for me, 3C is clear|pg||
nt|keylime: I liked the double for that reason Marshall - to cater to the maximum number of hand types|pg||
nt|cindy: i dont like 3C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but S cannot bid 4H|pg||
nt|cindy: N is the one with the Q of clubs and 4333 shape opposite a minimum hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: same principle for 3C. the golden rule of constructive bidding is that the 3 level is for game exploration. so whenever strain is in doubt, that is what the 3 level is for. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: choosing not to use it means you are pretty sure you know the right contract. i would not be at all sure of that holding the N cards|pg||
nt|forni: either: well done by NS, good stop in 3@D|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Gabor,wlc:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt could be dangerous !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @C or @D lead|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bobholl: on @D k lead 6@S migth make :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|cicus: hi Sunil, Liliek|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: So now i leave the table in very capable hands.|pg||
nt|werge: A bluff-double af 5 @C would work fine here - E/W would let West be declarer|pg||
nt|roswolf: he does some very good judgment calls here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|forni: or... Gill, why on earth wouldn't you bid 3@S?|pg||
nt|bobholl: NS obviously don't agree on the strength of this sequence|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mrdct: horwitz will be delighted with a 33-1 start given that they can now play their all-pro line-up for the rest of the match|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cindy: N has notrump cards  queens and jacks|pg||
nt|werge: claim|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|sybarra: might wish he had played another @H?|pg||
nt|bobholl: oops made :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sunsamvar: bye all and thanks|pg||
nt|westjava: ok Sunil ty n cu next|pg||
nt|cicus: bye|pg||
nt|cicus: this is going several down|pg||
nt|2hplus4: North seemingly could noit catch up after 2@D|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: thanks to our operator Fiona Brown - especially with the laptop problems|pg||
nt|cicus: I think E might have tried to play in a suit by bidding 3@C|pg||
nt|april7: nothing spectecular in this hand|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is a hand where its very important to count your tricks to make sure you end up|pg||
nt|mariner1: with enough.... and more than once|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s2|nt|cindy: i dont like complicating the bidding while giving away tons of info to the opps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fun and good input from fellow commentators Dave Thompson [Australia] and Nobuyuki Hayashi [Japan]|pg||
nt|cicus: which west would have corrected|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As they play precision @d is probably a better suit for the defence than @c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But I don´t like to lead from a J OR a 10|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bobholl: you have to find one of the aces rigth for your 10th trick |pg||
nt|bobholl: but they are both :)|pg||
nt|allanr44: should make 11 then  lol|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 losers :)|pg||
nt|allanr44: apart from that ...|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|cindy: just bid 3N and be done with it|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 7  tricks now|pg||
nt|cicus: to 3@D|pg||
pc|d6|nt|westjava: yes,in @D suit|pg||
nt|cicus: not that it makes but I think it is only 1 down|pg||

nt|cicus: lack of dummy entries has hurt here much|pg||
nt|allanr44: You were right Hans.  A small diamond even after the SK would have been testing|pg||
nt|snorris: this would be exitng in 4 @s now..|pg||

nt|westjava: wd|pg||
nt|bobholl: this is a better 6@S than the previous one|pg||
nt|werge: In fact the bad guess was veru clever|pg||
nt|bobholl: would have had to guess on small @D|pg||
nt|allanr44: yes, at any time in the hand|pg||
nt|werge: No guess in @D - because he had discarded the Jack|pg||
nt|werge: This is very close to 3 NT |pg||
nt|bobholl: true no other choice but K|pg||
nt|werge: Smells like 3 NT now|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks straightforward|pg||
nt|rado: strong @C auction|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @h and a sacrifice in 4 @s|pg||
nt|april7: now we have a duplication of values and only 5 @H makeable|pg||
nt|snorris: if n invites s will raise|pg||
nt|bobh1: N says: "if I'd known you were going to play it so well I'd have bid more"|pg||
nt|rado: 1NT 4th pos :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: How many @S will be opened?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 1,2 and 4 are optrions|pg||
mb|2D|an|Multi|nt|mcarroll: even 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: weak NT by South here|pg||
nt|cicus: I exected something higher than 2@D|pg||
nt|cicus: a case of taste|pg||
nt|mcarroll: another 3NT|pg||
mb|2H!|an|p/c|nt|mariner1: 4@S, 4@H and 3N here EW|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1@S 41C my guess|pg||
mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: bingo|pg||
nt|westjava: agree,Gabor|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@C|pg||
nt|kapitanski: 1nt  14-16|pg||
nt|snorris: only 10 tricks if e-w find the @d ruff|pg||
nt|rado: now difficult to enter with @Ssuit|pg||
nt|rado: and 3NT :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, no way to play a different contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: 3 nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: you are peaking dwayne|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very hard bid for N now|pg||
nt|cicus: case for only 2@D is the 4-card spades and the @C void |pg||
nt|bobholl: it is not easy to coorporatye now with the 4 small @S|pg||
nt|bobholl: and KQ of @C|pg||
nt|2hplus4: could S not double for black suits?|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: now!|pg||
nt|snorris: 2 @s|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: 3N has play issues so 4 of a major seems best|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS presumably play that this sequence shows genuine club length by S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: fortunately for S she has an easy pass|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but the play could take a while|pg||
nt|cindy: i keep wanting to say bingo, keylime|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: not so easy it seems....she is in the tank|pg||
nt|cindy: u already said that marshall|pg||
nt|cindy: i just saw that|pg||
nt|cindy: i thought that before   last set :)|pg||
nt|keylime: she might bid 3, out of the thinking that she needs to "protect her teammates"|pg||
nt|april7: only if they try for slam and stop in 5 then its important the @D lead|pg||
nt|snorris: still difficult|pg||
nt|ralfwil: why not 2@hX|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|vugrapha3: she passed|pg||
nt|rado: now NS may start slam investigation|pg||
nt|april7: I am sure they will try but will they stop???|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not vuln can be a risk to play 2@H Dbl|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, N didnt bid 2D, so 3C ought to be INV|pg||
nt|westjava: under bid..??|pg||
nt|werge: Double for the @S-lead would have worked fine here|pg||
nt|werge: The wrong Jack was lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: now he has to get a trick from the @Ds|pg||
nt|allanr44: win Q and small spade is probably best|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In the old days, N had an optional X and S could pass. but not now|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|snorris: if they cuebid they should be able|pg||
nt|rado: 4@C cue is discouraging for S|pg||
nt|april7: E on lead will never start with small @D|pg||
nt|snorris: but then it will be revealed thay lack ace+king in @d so e-w might find the defence|pg||
nt|rado: cue's may help E to find the lead|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cindy: everyone agree with 2H ?|pg||
nt|keylime: the 9@d led against the 3NT in the other room which hit paydirt|pg||
nt|werge: South must put his money on the @D 10|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Should N go to 4 level when partner could not bid over 1NT?|pg||
nt|snorris: why annonce the @c suit?|pg||
nt|snorris: if you are going to play 3nt anyway|pg||
nt|rado: 2NT relay fot 5th Major|pg||
nt|snorris: ah..|pg||
nt|rado: nothing to do with @C|pg||
nt|snorris: sorry|pg||
nt|rado: @H lead and @S return for down 1 only|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bobholl: even 7 possible now but won't happen :)|pg||
nt|kapitanski: both pair  use  2-4  lead here|pg||
nt|snorris: my lead too|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|sA|nt|april7: who shouldcue @D?|pg||
nt|rado: lack of @D cue|pg||
nt|snorris: nobody and then e-w know..|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mariner1: this makes with careful play|pg||
nt|rado: another quick claim|pg||
nt|snorris: j of @s |pg||
pc|s4|nt|allanr44: yes  :)|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Playing @H looks normal|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|werge: Never take a trick, when...|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|2hplus4: Side suit first is invariably good advice|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: that was an illadvised cover|pg||
nt|allanr44: shd play heart to dummy and another small spade|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you see 52 crds a small @D is much easier|pg||
nt|werge: Even with J-9 in South, East shoul have played low first time|pg||
nt|werge: J-)-x|pg||
nt|bobh1: with @c situation @s gave up a key tempo|pg||
nt|snorris: lucky..|pg||
pc|d2|nt|swanson: Better to have led a spade to the king at trick two, then start hearts.|pg||
nt|sybarra: good bye @D|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cicus: EW did very well to let this be played|pg||
nt|werge: J 9 x|pg||
nt|allanr44: true, but it would be nice if the def broke diamonds|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|bobh1: impossible to find a @h lead I think |pg||
pc|h2|pc|d6|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h4|pc|s5|nt|werge: This is a poor slam, when South has opened, and nod good either without this information. But for a team trailing, you should maybe bid it|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h5|pc|c2|nt|cicus: hmm|pg||
nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|cicus: only 9 tricks this way|pg||
nt|westjava: yes,no more...|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if S had another heart, it was very likely she then had no diamond loser, so W should not cover the hear6t jack|pg||
pc|s9|nt|santyclz: S had to duck the @h.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|werge: Best play would be @D - trying Ace-King in East - or the 10 in West|pg||
nt|ralfwil: at least -4 in 2@hX|pg||
pc|hT|nt|snorris: might e think s has 5 @s ?|pg||

mb|4D!|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: west should have signed off|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: pls east be conservative|pg||
nt|ralfwil: two different scools. 5@s to ask for @c control OR 4@s|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: instead, if 4@D means no @C control, then 4@H means @C control, not @h !|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: How do you play? 5@s?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Blackwood is useless with two small cards in a side suit, let alone a void|pg||

nt|keylime: Ohno will be pretty happy after the stumble early on to be in this position|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for all W knew, S might have AKQx of spades and be planning to throw dummy's Ds on spades, but led stiff heart jack as a no-cost extra chance play|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: last board of the match|pg||
nt|sybarra: the the drum roll now |pg||
nt|cicus: not eat's duck, if he'd taken the trick he'd have been endpalyed|pg||
nt|cicus: *note|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I don't like hands like the west one. 2 5 card suits, 12 hcp, a void, but no ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: still commenting about previous deal|pg||
nt|werge: Nice slam - small values|pg||
nt|snorris: 5 @d or 3nt?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes and of course to make it worse, when you are not in slam you make 6|pg||
nt|werge: For keeping the figtimg-spirit, I would have taken only 11 tricks...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: on the lie of the cards EW can make 4@S here|pg||
mb|1C!|an|11-13NT/17+|nt|bridge_one: yes, was right here - but North could have the same cards with xx in @h - in that case pass it is worst|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: this could be interesting or P P P P|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't mind - as long as partner has a 4 card fit!|pg||
nt|2hplus4: And we can find it|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes both sides have a 2 suited fit - who will win the auction|pg||
nt|rado: disciplinned pass by Skorchev:)|pg||

nt|rado: maybe 1NT and 2@D art FG|pg||
nt|snorris: probably|pg||
nt|rado: or 2@C inv|pg||
nt|werge: Here a lkook at one opponents cards should bring 4 @S home|pg||
mb|2C|nt|swanson: No way 3rd seat passes this hand.|pg||

nt|cicus: quite aggressive, this 1@H|pg||
mb|2S|an|11-13 w/ supp|mb|p|nt|cindy: ohno gonna win|pg||
nt|sybarra: ths also to Dwayne, Cindy and Marshall |pg||
nt|marlowepi: the technical bid on the hand is 1NT, but see my profile.  24 came just in time|pg||
nt|cicus: it will be hard to stop east below 6@D|pg||
nt|westjava: even they play precision|pg||
nt|baldfriede: East's pass is a bit too passive for my taste|pg||
nt|roswolf: well now how will n/s get in and progress the auction from here|pg||
nt|werge: look|pg||
mb|4D|an|splinter|nt|keylime: 1@d = 0-6 or natural or relay|pg||
nt|keylime: 1@c = 2+@c|pg||
nt|cindy: the next set is supposed to start in 5 minutes   not sure that will start on time|pg||
nt|keylime: and that's all she wrote folks|pg||
nt|werge: To get it much more exciting, we need a TD-ruling for ½ IMP|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: yes, borderline, I'd have passed but opened if my @SJ were in @Ds|pg||
nt|snorris: and @c lead from north|pg||
nt|rado: seems reversed meanings|pg||
nt|werge: - or a @H-lead|pg||
mb|4S|nt|allanr44: lol|pg||
nt|bobholl: my chinese is very bad does anybody know wheather this is the deciding match ? |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Perhaps 2@C shows majors and he is stuck|pg||
nt|april7: 2NT or 3NT, which is stronger??|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: yes few would|pg||
nt|westjava: pd opening and you have 18 hcp...|pg||
nt|snorris: 6 @d can be won double dummy but..|pg||
nt|rado: after 2@D 3NT would suggests some 3334@c minimum hahd|pg||
nt|snorris: looks like it |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i think the other room is behind us so assuredly not|pg||
nt|bobholl: vulnerable no future for NS|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Good lead. Let declarer struggle to find his tricks. Should do it here though|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this dbl is dangerous with void in @s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and pays the price|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: - but that opens for a @H-ruff|pg||
pc|cK|nt|keylime: we're about 1.5 boards ahead here |pg||
nt|allanr44: i think so|pg||
nt|roswolf: south has double - crossed himself should have bid at his first turn|pg||
pc|c6|nt|westjava: good stop|pg||
nt|cicus: what's the problem? :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: the play should be quick|pg||
nt|kapitanski: quick claim now|pg||
nt|werge: 8 minutes then|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|rado: sinse W might have 4M etc...|pg||
nt|snorris: 10 or 9 tricks ..depends on the lead|pg||
nt|snorris: @c: 10, @s: 9|pg||
nt|werge: 3 NT cold N/S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Could have been worse - could have easily been doubled|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: and of course,  thx to our specs the best audience in the world!|pg||
nt|sybarra: we appreciate your comments|pg||
nt|werge: If this is deciding, I would lead the @C 9|pg||
nt|werge: Bravo|pg||
nt|kapitanski: aronov-stefanov  play perfect   without  any  mistake  today|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i am sure they have made one slight mistake but this is a very competent performance by them |pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mariner1: N risks jacking them up one and it works|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6 @H 2@S 2aces !NEXT|pg||
nt|allanr44: not a lot of entries to develop tricks|pg||
nt|werge: This lead killed the overtrick|pg||
nt|allanr44: yes|pg||
nt|werge: The @C-ruff went away|pg||
pc|cA|nt|swanson: I would double 3@H with the South hand - this can't be playing well for delcarer.|pg||
nt|mariner1: now they are likely off in 3@H|pg||
nt|cicus: E could diagnose duplication of values in time|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mariner1: win @SA and cash Q and a @D works here|pg||
nt|swanson: It is matchpoints - IMP double would be quite wrong.|pg||
nt|allanr44: and no short diamond honour on side|pg||
nt|baldfriede: can make 11 tricks if ruffing the @h and discarding an @s if North does not overtake K@h|pg||
nt|baldfriede: no, 10 only|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mariner1: IMPS across the field I think|pg||
nt|santyclz: At mps if pd came into a live auction like that, pass wouldn't occur to me.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cicus: realized his club honours don't pull full weight|pg||
nt|westjava: yes,and he is a captain|pg||
nt|bobh1: they have kept low . . . can they now go plus?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 3@s is makeable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@s loosers and 1 @h|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes - lucky with 1@C position|pg||
nt|ralfwil: declarer must plst @s10|pg||
nt|bridge_one: lucky finding 7 @S in South and @S 3/3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @s9 I mean|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after a @c ruff @sK from the hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: interesting part score battle here...... easy for someone to get too high|pg||
nt|werge: Italian double?|pg||
nt|april7: 3@D!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|2hplus4: Presumably that's up to scratch for a Bulgarian club suit|pg||

nt|snorris: 3 @d ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|an|17+, bal or C|nt|bobholl: possible to stop in @C now :)|pg||
nt|allanr44: what about the vul opening?|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: 2@H is not a forcing in Precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: N decided 2@H was better than 3@C|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Nevertheless I would not have liked astopping here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Is minimum...|pg||
nt|allanr44: it is that|pg||
nt|bobholl: not even opening for me :)|pg||
nt|allanr44: or me|pg||
nt|baldfriede: stopping*|pg||
nt|2hplus4: A comfortable part score Game was unlikely|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bord 9 primabridge played in 2@SX in both rooms - 14 imps away!|pg||
nt|rado: another quick 9 tricks for EW|pg||
nt|snorris: 9 tricks e-w!|pg||
mb|2D!|an|no 5+m/6+sp|nt|werge: No - but with K B 10 etc. og @S, it´s OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: in @S|pg||
nt|bobholl: they have good understanding we see 3nt reasonable|pg||
nt|allanr44: I'd prefer better spades myself|pg||
nt|rado: 2@H is weak raise with 3 trumps|pg||
mb|2N|nt|cicus: seems like 2@C is reserved for something other for EW|pg||
nt|bobholl: if N bids 2@D now does that show half a @D stop ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: this is better|pg||
nt|kapitanski: I not like this pass|pg||
nt|april7: S is squeezed|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South would pass 3Nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|ctcbaadmin: not a bad slam but the HK is not where it should be|pg||
nt|cicus: hence the 1@D opening|pg||
nt|allanr44: excellent spot.  I wonder if the 3@C implied some spade stopper?|pg||
nt|snorris: got off the hook|pg||
nt|rado: from E's view hard to plase @S A exactly|pg||
nt|april7: go homme quickly|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cicus: dangerously high but escaped the double|pg||
nt|roswolf: an unusual contract 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: which is hard to understand with the N hand|pg||
nt|cicus: a rel waste|pg||
nt|cicus: *real|pg||
nt|westjava: sry,brb in 5 mnt|pg||
nt|snorris: east will try 3nt I think'|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A in @s short and Jxxx in @H are sufficient to play 3Nt - he know can be a disaster|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Of course P on 3nt but 5@d is a good save|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can't be a disaster (keyboard error)|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: and 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|snorris: all returns vere on|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|mariner1: well no battle after all :(|pg||

nt|bobholl: very well done espcially the bidding  |pg||
nt|baldfriede: And indeed we wound up with an uncomfortable part score result.|pg||
nt|2hplus4: The defence lost their way there though|pg||
nt|rado: maybe 1@S-2@C-4@H :)|pg||
nt|snorris: likly|pg||
nt|rado: and E will downgrade his hand due to bad KC! |pg||
nt|rado: k@C|pg||
nt|snorris: or @s-3@c ?|pg||
nt|april7: 5@H only |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Better defence is @d3 from N and a small @c from S!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to make 4@H need a help from opps|pg||
mb|1C!|an|11-13NT/17+|nt|werge: Seems, that the @C-suit can bring in 3 NT here|pg||
nt|allanr44: Just look at those scores!|pg||
nt|werge: Let´s end up with 3 NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: now n/s must be careful not to get too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: another part score POSSIBLE battle here|pg||

nt|ralfwil: of course declarer can do right, but it´s more difficult|pg||
mb|p!|nt|bobholl: 3nt and good contract reached|pg||

nt|snorris: 11 fast tricks|pg||
nt|rado: well Skorchev starts playing with us when he was 14-15 years old:)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ctcbaadmin: some south may choose to respond 1H with weak 4-5.  if they reach 4H it will hv no chance|pg||
nt|cicus: S will have to cover @C10 to prevent the 12th trick|pg||
nt|werge: Declarer can make ONT trump-trick here|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: ONE|pg||
nt|roswolf: that 3NT bid is very heavy and could have cost a slam swing on another day|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|mariner1: well can he make it?|pg||
nt|bobholl: but i don't think S can find that :)|pg||

nt|snorris: young guns are they ?|pg||
nt|werge: In 3 NT it´s good technic, when West covers the @s 8!|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 2 aces missing bidding 6 ? losing tactics :)|pg||
nt|snorris: with correct defence|pg||

nt|rado: "tricky"lead from QJ trump doubleton|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bobholl: may be 5@D was 03 and w thougth 3 :)|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||

pc|h4|nt|2hplus4: But there was nothing better for the defence|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cicus: but even that may not be enough if N can be squeezed between @Hs and @Cs|pg||

nt|snorris: should go -2 as south will play on 9-10 out in @hs in easts hand|pg||
nt|snorris: north will play fo course|pg||
nt|april7: still only 11, so he will give up a @D and hope for @H finesse|pg||
nt|snorris: of|pg||
nt|april7: or spade @H squeeze, but W will return @H after J of !J|pg||
nt|april7: J of @D|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|april7: N has already  a bad feeling|pg||
nt|rado: the lead might be even from Jxxx provoking yes/no decision fordeclarer|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bobholl: 1 down is good bridge (he will finesse @S)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mariner1: kibbers suggesting 5@D save, however EW have defense too|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|d5|nt|santyclz: Well the defense has managed to break all 3 side suits.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|ctcbaadmin: north needs to have KJ9x in hearts to beat this|pg||
nt|ctcbaadmin: declarer will surely guess the club position when he knew that north bhas led from Qx of spades|pg||
nt|ctcbaadmin: on a H return, declarer can establish a H trick to avoid the club guess|pg||
nt|bobholl: now he will also make 6|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cicus: the club goes away but S scores a trump in exchange|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
nt|allanr44: perhaps not, but of no consequence|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|bobholl: he surely trumped :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: see what i meant|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|allanr44: of course|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mariner1: yes and that helps declarer|pg||
nt|allanr44: and the last one ...|pg||

nt|bridge_one: i think yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this could turn out nasty for e/w|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ralfwil: If I´m right informed, a relative|pg||
nt|vugraphzky: Surely not, i'm told|pg||
nt|roswolf: east might have tried 1NT over 1@H i suppose|pg||
mb|d|nt|daman: in the previous session both pairs played the fert (fertilizer) system     it was really hard to follow   glad it has changed for this session|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: ah an enlightened country in allowing forcing pass systems!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: better 1Nt at first round that DBL over 2@s|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bridge_one: however West would bid 2Nt (i suppose) with 44+minors|pg||
nt|roswolf: oop the 3-3 fit = where is david burn when you need him!|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||

mb|p|nt|werge: So Yeh Brothers will be the winner - or shall the last two boards decide?|pg||
nt|werge: Another sporty 6 @S|pg||
nt|allanr44: 1 board I think|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't see a normal way to 12 tricks ew|pg||

nt|kapitanski: ty Geoffrey  and ty all  specialy  BBO  and  Roland|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: ty all|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ctcbaadmin: same thing could happen here if East also opens 1H|pg||
nt|westjava: and when the next scedule?|pg||
nt|snorris: 6 @s ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW can make 3N here and 4@H|pg||
nt|ctcbaadmin: 2S seems to be a minor suit preemptive|pg||
mb|1N|an|11-13|nt|cicus: I don't know|pg||
nt|bridge_one: E/W could make 2@S here|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: CONGRATULATIONS to the new (old) CHAPMION of Bulgaria - the team of Quantum ! Very well done !!!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and N/S are down at 2Nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: not much inthis one, 11 tricks |pg||
nt|rado: 4@H 0-15 points bid when limited opening:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: fortunately dummy has a little help in @S|pg||
mb|p|pc|h9|nt|westjava: maybe operator can help us|pg||
nt|cicus: seems like NS can make 6@S here even on a @D lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: N should not "SAVE" after 4@H|pg||
nt|snorris: not a good contract mind you..|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S by N or S without any ig problems|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes and according to their earlier bidding - astonishing!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cicus: by a double squeeze, but may take the club finesse instead|pg||
nt|snorris: thats the strength of big @c systems|pg||
nt|rado: bid quickly and watch opps :)|pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bobholl: bad luck for ew|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|bobholl: although 4@H is already too high with @H 32|pg||
nt|bobholl: with 2 @C 1 @S and 1@H to loose|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rado: now Nanev may show @S fit with @C values|pg||
pc|c2|nt|2hplus4: Wondering whether to switch to @D now|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S is a nice save|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mcarroll: 4@H a better contract thn 3NT and should make with ease - and overtricks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|westjava: squeez in @H and @C|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't see the harm in a @D to the A and a @D towards the queen|pg||
nt|rado: S facing wasted values in his singleton quietly passed 4@S|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bobholl: oops :)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ctcbaadmin: south shud follow D9 so that East's D5 maybe from 542|pg||
