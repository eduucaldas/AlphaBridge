nt|3for3: both pairs using a big club|pg||
nt|dburn: strong club from both pairs, as indeed may be the case at the other table|pg||
nt|3for3: I think brad and fred are still standard players|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|an|neg|mb|p|nt|dburn: indeed they are - should have checked who was actually at the other table|pg||
mb|4H|nt|3for3: diamond stays quiet, many would use some gadget to get in there|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: he may have intended to act at his second turn to show a good hand - an immediate bid would be weak|pg||
nt|3for3: zhuang knows partner doesn't have enough for slam, so he goes quickly|pg||
nt|dburn: but things have not worked out well if that was his approach|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Half time scores: Nickell 108 - OÂ’Rourke 27; Cayne 60 - Sutherlin 61; Pszczola 20 - Katz 94; China 41 - Diamond 40;|pg||
nt|barnets: 6h is slightly lesss than 50 percent on spade finesse|pg||
nt|dburn: not that he has missed anything very much by staying quiet, of course|pg||
nt|barnets: of course may get spade lead|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|3for3: wang could have had 4 low hearts king of spades and minor ace, and slam would be cold|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|dburn: or four low hearts, a singleton spade and an ace - slam would still be pretty good|pg||

nt|dburn: but Zhuang's approach is eminently practical - if he takes things slowly, his opponents might wake up and bid a minor|pg||
mb|1S|nt|3for3: or know not to lead a spade|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: that also|pg||
mb|3S|an|preemptive|nt|3for3: anyone for a slightly off 3@S?  diamond did as i typed|pg||
mb|4D|mb|4S|nt|dburn: North-South can make about four diamonds, East-West can make - well, a trump lead might beat a spade game|pg||
nt|barnets: as to lead a trump to beat 4spades|pg||
nt|3for3: with hearts 52, does it matter?|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe not|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Jon Cooke|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Hi all|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Nice close match to entertain us here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: in fact, with hearts 5-2 and spades 3-1 East-West might not be able to make even three spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Wang shaking his head, thinking, now passes|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s6|nt|3for3: zhuang doesn't know about wang's great trumps.  so he will think he does need to shift|pg||
nt|barnets: can manage 3s ok by ruffing the heart either low or the ace and losing a trump 2 diams annd a club|pg||
nt|3for3: well done, even if it didnt matter here|pg||
nt|3for3: Moss bid on, though a slightly different auction.  so diamond will lose 4|pg||
nt|3for3: not the kind of 4 you hate to lose, though, since game was close|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Unusual to preempt to the 3 level with only 3 trumps. Mixing it up a bit early in the set, perhaps.|pg||
nt|dburn: slightly surprised that Moss did bid on, when Gitelman's free bid had come only at the three level|pg||
nt|3for3: but he had not shown any diamonds, and had 3 pretty good ones|pg||
nt|dburn: but he had overcalled 2@h, so he had not promised much in the way of suitability for diamonds|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|dburn: and as 2@h overcalls go, that's a pretty good hand for diamonds|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|s4|nt|mugsmate: 4S came down to pips unless he found a trump lead, so it was a bit of a two way shot: if either game makes big gain - if both one down - small loss.|pg||

mb|d|nt|mugsmate: 15 so called "Pearson points" (spades+HCP)|pg||
nt|3for3: bidding seems percentage, but not by a whole lot|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|dburn: if the non-vulnerable opponents did not open the bidding, you should open in fourth seat whatever your hand - if they could make anything, they would have opened|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: looks to be a partial  in hearts |pg||
nt|mugsmate: If East West stop low this time, EW have scope to get into trouble, protecting with no fit.|pg||
nt|mugsmate: NS|pg||
mb|1D!|an|can be 2|nt|dburn: likely to start with a catch-all 1@d|pg||
mb|1S|nt|3for3: filthy but 21st centruy overcall, I guess|pg||
mb|2H|an|nf|nt|dburn: and the question is: what does South need for a vulnerable overcall?|pg||
nt|3for3: 13 cards|pg||
nt|dburn: and the answer is: merely the fact that it is his turn to bid|pg||
nt|barnets: 3n ew has some play|pg||
nt|mugsmate: T/O X from North over the NF 2H bid?|pg||
mb|d|nt|barnets: due to the lucky heart layout|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Platnick asked if DBL was T/O and Wang said yes|pg||
nt|mugsmate: East will probably rescue them by raising.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dburn: maybe he can redouble to show three hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: no, he can't|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: n/s  could get into some problem|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|dburn: well, defending 3@h is the least of the problems they could have got into|pg||
nt|3for3: this play won't be fast|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|dburn: slightly surprising, that - I'd thought he would try the queen of hearts, rather than low to the jack|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I didn't actually see Diamond's card on the heart - he might have taken a deeper finesse - was distracted by Platnick looking for a monitor so he could go to the restroom|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|barnets: as north has thew classic pattern 2-15-5 for the x HQ is clearly best|pg||
nt|dburn: but China has a pretty solid result from the closed room, where North-South did not enter the bidding at all|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Best to duck to damage communications. Looks natural as well.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: It was definitely low from dummy (even I can see what remains in dummy :)) but might have been to the 8|pg||
nt|dburn: low to the eight would be a really strange way to go about things|pg||
nt|mugsmate: It was a swift diamond return - a club looks worth considering to set up overuffs while part still has a diamond entry.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: That's why I "played" the J, but just in case I was wrong I thought I should confess early |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|dburn: this is hard to work out, but declarer may survive if he ducks this trick|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|3for3: he passed that hurdle, but still not home yet|pg||
nt|mugsmate: I wonder if he's picked the shapes. If he has he can play on spades and late in the hand ruff a club high in hand while ruffing spades in dummy to make 9.|pg||
nt|dburn: his black-suit spots are powerful, and the defense has no communication|pg||
nt|barnets: well i think hes going down|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d2|nt|ady: looks like 6 or 8 imps to n/s|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|dburn: he is now|pg||
nt|mugsmate: He played North for 22(45) where he needed to draw trumps.|pg||
nt|dburn: and as Danny remarked, that's a 21st century swing - the Chinese were offering up at least a 200 penalty of their own as soon as they opened their mouths, but they succeeded in ...|pg||
nt|dburn: pushing the opponents around|pg||
nt|3for3: They say it is a bidder's game, but I am an unapologetic passer with that hand, still|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Diamond still studying his hand and dummy, probably trying to find some route to 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|3for3: I was surely correct that this would be slow....|pg||

nt|dburn: on two rounds of diamonds? can they?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mugsmate: can in theory - draw a trump - cash 1 club and exit to north in spades who has to give you to dummy to draw trumps.|pg||

nt|barnets: or just play 1 trump and a spade|pg||
nt|barnets: ns have no defense|pg||

nt|dburn: well, they can't make 3NT at least|pg||
nt|mugsmate: No you are right.|pg||
nt|3for3: diamond thinks platnick has shown a @D stopper|pg||
nt|dburn: and I am not quite sure what East is trying to do, but West may imagine that East has a diamond guard but no spade guard|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mugsmate: Diamond thinks Platnick is showing a diamond stop I suspect, so he's bid 3NT because he has a spade stop.|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: mightn't they make 4 if they either can get the clubs  going or guess the diamonds? Other room got a heart ruff, but is that necessary?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|dburn: indeed - if West does drive to game he may make it, so could be either a small or a large gain for Diamond|pg||
