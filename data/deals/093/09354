nt|chick: when partner starts a forcing defense, trying to switch to playing trumps is kinda self-defeating|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: 3NT might make EW (previous board) but i think 150 is a good score|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|dburn: it might have made with a heart lead, certainly, but with a spade lead it looked pretty hopeless|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: theres nothing particularly wrong with the idea behind this year's selection event|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: they were unfortunate that a team withdrew at the last minute|pg||
nt|dburn: so some measure of restitution for ill fortune on the previous deal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right now -- Italy seems to be most enamored with their selection method [winning=good method]|pg||

nt|mariner1: maybe shows @D or @H and @S|pg||

nt|ahollan1: in OZ  very unusual for bid to be natural :)|pg||

mb|4N!|nt|ahollan1: uh oh -- i found notes   1@C-(1@D)-2@H = same as 1@C-P-2@H  whould would be 9-11 3-suit or 15+ BAL|pg||
nt|mariner1: if it is then N's call is not 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: things may have changed since Beijing - but Peter told me these notes supposed to be best available|pg||

nt|paulhac: 0 or 3 is in keeping with that|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if Richman is equally confused and passes, they may survive|pg||
nt|mariner1: Moscito with transfers?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one thing for sure -- when a Relay Partnership makes a wrong bid -- auctions get to be very bizarre|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: according to peter's explanations 2@s was a relay and 2NT showed 15+ BAL|pg||
nt|Walddk2: oh dear|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 4n plays well as W will not likely lead a @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hah -- my notes and reading ability were right|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 4@c was natural and 4@s was a cue for @c|pg||
nt|dburn: it isn't his lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Richman 2@H was the hiccup|pg||
nt|dburn: but East may lead a diamond anyway - his partner did overcall in the suit|pg||
nt|dburn: however, they have got to pass it out first|pg||
