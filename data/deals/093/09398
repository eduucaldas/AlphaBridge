nt|bobh1: a hyper-modern 2@s bid|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mariner1: realize|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|Vugraphu2: NS play upside down carding|pg||
nt|royhughes: mark chen notes that declarer may strip hearts and play clubs, leaving the defense to open up diamonds|pg||
nt|royhughes: maybe one entry short for that|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer could enter dummy with @HQ and lead the @DQ (ruff later to dummy for long diamond).|pg||
nt|swanson: That looks best to me and is a winner.|pg||
nt|swanson: Not that he knows the @HQ is an entry.|pg||
nt|joest: very tough hand to guess right|pg||
nt|royhughes: a heart to the queen and then queen of diamonds looks best to me|pg||
nt|royhughes: It's past my bedtime -- I was planning to leave the card play to my fellow commentators|pg||
nt|joest: once he's there for the first time it does seem right to play diamonds, not clubs|pg||
nt|royhughes: sure, because you may be able to cross on a trump to cash the long diamond|pg||
nt|swanson: Anything works if the @CA is onside - the object to try to keep North off lead until you get a shot a the @D9 as a winner.|pg||
nt|joest: right|pg||
nt|royhughes: If a heart to queen, QKA diamonds, I guess declarer would then play a heart|pg||
nt|royhughes: and South can take the ace and play a third heart|pg||
nt|swanson: He can't affort that becuase of a 3rd heart before declarer gets a shot at the long diamond.|pg||
nt|chthonic: That line works with the ten of diamonds south either doubleton or third, but if the king is south, the suit blocks and the defense can attack the trump entry with heart leads|pg||
nt|swanson: The @S9 is an entry which can't be dislodeged.|pg||
nt|joest: declarer just takes the heart in his hand and tests diamonds|pg||

nt|swanson: Moss knows the situation for the defense is hopeless at this point.|pg||
nt|royhughes: If declarer had the 8 of diamonds Moss could hope he would try a finesse|pg||
nt|joest: if declarer is 5=2=3=3 he has a chance by getting out a diamond|pg||
nt|swanson: I wasn't watching North's heart spots, but he has surely signaled his length to partner.|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think he echoed, and I think that gave count|pg||
nt|joest: probably true but nothing else seems to hold much promise. As you say he's pretty sure Levin is cold at this point|pg||
nt|swanson: It would be much against the odds now for Levin to make any play other than cashing the @DJ.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|mugsmate: No side has an 8 card fit here,|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: 2@s worked well . . . told S to forget about looking for a magic @h fit|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|2H|nt|joest: this board will not be as exciting as the other room. |pg||
nt|joest: Greco opened as East with a Precisio 2@d and it went double redouble all pass|pg||

mb|p|nt|mmmakela: nice bid 3 @H imo|pg||
mb|3N|nt|swanson: I would have guessed 1NT with the West cards.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mugsmate: So 2D in both rooms. We are watching the low stake table.|pg||
nt|swanson: 2@D is probably one off - losing four diamonds and two aces/|pg||
nt|royhughes: One way to beat this is to take the ace and shift to the stiff club|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes good evaluation|pg||
nt|bobh1: also lots of play|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 9@S in N big card here........  of course so are the rounded K's in E for declarer|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not so sure ab 3 NT|pg||
pc|c7|nt|royhughes: Although declarer is likely to lose 4 trumps anyway, as John says|pg||
nt|joest: with south having a singleton club there's no way to try to use clubs to neutralize the eight of diamonds either|pg||
nt|swanson: There is not a big risk usually is defending two of a minor doubled - redoubled does more that redouble the stakes - a game is now involved.|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Threatens two off if declarer starts with a top trump. although perhaps ramming clubs through south will neutralise the d8.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N makes now|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|bobh1: if @s's were reversed EW would be able to set|pg||
nt|bobh1: but 2@c bid hinted at the actual sit|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s3|pc|d7|pc|hK|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mugsmate: Weinstein shows us how it's done, don't play trumps at all. The defense needed to cash the hA to prevent declarer doing that.|pg||
nt|joest: I suspect it will not take Weinstein as much time to go down as it will Greco :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: This may be a long night|pg||

mb|d|nt|mugsmate: Apparently there has been a request for a ruling next door a kib tells me.|pg||
nt|royhughes: Some pairs play methods where North can ask partner's opinion about whether to save|pg||
nt|joest: although those most typically occur after double|pg||
nt|swanson: Moss is at the top end of a favorable vul preempt, both offense and defense.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mugsmate: Anyway 5D could just have been cold with 5S one off another day. Always difficult - that's why people preempt|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Vugraphu2: weinstein asking moss to give him the "right count" - joking|pg||
nt|royhughes: 3NT is best here|pg||
nt|swanson: 3NT is the winner here, but 4@H is more likely to be the contract.|pg||
mb|d|nt|joest: how about opening this 3NT fourth chair? :)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|royhughes: as a contract, I mean, not an opening bid!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: 2NT is a creative opening bid, one you can get away with opposite a passed partner|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Anyone know what this all means?|pg||
nt|joest: unless of course he is rude enough to bid 4NT|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2 @D seems more descrptv from passed hand than 1 nt|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|mmmakela: little shy on points but good suit|pg||
pc|c4|nt|royhughes: This is unlucky for Moss -- usually a passed hand can't raise to 4NT|pg||
nt|swanson: South's bidding does not appear to be consistent with the cards we are looking at.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: this is the actual bidding|pg||
nt|joest: it is consistent with someone trying to produce 4th quarter swings though :)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|swanson: I though RIchard Walsh andMarty Cohn were the only bridge players to bid like this.|pg||
nt|joest: in the meantime, the defenders willbe doing well to beat this|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think the 2N opening is a reasonable shot -- he is thinking that 4@h may not be there opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|chthonic: It will be difficult to defend because the picture is so distorted|pg||
nt|joest: not so clear to lead away from the club king at trick two|pg||
nt|ritong: not clear at all|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mugsmate: Greco has asked for a ruling of 2Dxx-2 back to off 1 due to being told "no agreement" when his partner was told "diamonds". They have gone to consider and have asked play to ...|pg||
nt|mugsmate: continue.|pg||
nt|royhughes: however, it may be the right play -- you don't rate to beat 4NT passively with those spades in dummy (maybe)|pg||
nt|swanson: Levin knows something strange has happened in the bidding but it will be difficult to dtermine what it is.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|swanson: Declarer simply cannot have two (or three) small diamonds on this auction.|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|mugsmate: I suspect he'll just cash the dA thinking he's saving the overtrick:)|pg||
nt|ritong: he just has five @cs|pg||
nt|ritong: plus the 5 hcp we can see in west s hand*|pg||
nt|royhughes: He must be wondering why his partner didn't lead from his heart length|pg||
nt|joest: that is the best clue|pg||
nt|ritong: that is a good point|pg||
nt|royhughes: in which case he might come up with the right answer|pg||
nt|mugsmate: He may be asking himself "Why hasn't partner lead a heart?"|pg||
nt|mugsmate: sorry - snap|pg||
nt|swanson: He 'knows' partner would be looking at no entries to his presumed heart suit.|pg||
nt|ritong: well, it depends of whay levin knows about his pard s leading style with a seven bagger and a yarb|pg||
nt|royhughes: If declarer has no major, partner has 7 hearts and passed|pg||
nt|royhughes: it's possible, I suppose|pg||
nt|joest: if declarer has 19 (common), he might fear that leading a club is blowing the tenth trick if declarer lacks the ten.  Declarer has four spades, three hearts and two clubs only|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|joest: and if he works spades first, he'll become very sure|pg||

nt|royhughes: If he scores a ruff in hand, maybe he will get out with the king of spades, to keep Moss from getting in twice to play trumps|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|joest: Levin and Weinstein have played very well|pg||
nt|swanson: By that standard, Diamond has been very unlucky.|pg||
nt|xenya: making 3 -- great result|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|mugsmate: For sure. A world class performance by the Katz team.|pg||
nt|royhughes: indeed|pg||
nt|mmmakela: any kibs watched Chinese Open Snooker? how did the Ding Junhui match end?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|royhughes: and late at night at the end of a long tournament|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: 2NT is an artificial inquiry.|pg||

pc|hK|nt|joest: so a misguess in spades won't harm him|pg||
nt|ritong: a rare case where a doubleton lead looks right, with double trump control|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|xenya: lead helped|pg||
nt|xenya: can make it now on a spade finesse or double finesse in @Cs|pg||
nt|xenya: if he gets both right, he makes an ovetrick, if both wrong, he is down|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mugsmate: Gitelman hoping to be able to use his trump entries to establish a diamond ruff.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mmmakela: testing|pg||

nt|royhughes: some other day it would work|pg||
nt|swanson: The heart situation is one where pure luck can decided the fate of the contract - you might need to have the @HK on opening lead.|pg||

nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|xenya: well you can't pass with W's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: the question is what to bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS could play in a tough 4@H or EW could save or phantom save in 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@S looks OK at these colours|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 @S seems good pressure bid white|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: would anyone start with a negative double lest a diamond raise blow you out of your spade fit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@S has virtually no chance...however 4@H might be hard to get to now...... and it|pg||
nt|mariner1: might not make anyway|pg||
nt|mmmakela: lol|pg||
pc|d8|nt|joest: at least one would!|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@S has to be good for EW,,, good call|pg||
nt|xenya: down 1 off the top|pg||
pc|d4|nt|swanson: For me it is an automatid negative double.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|royhughes: well reasoned|pg||
nt|joest: i know lots of people who'd bid 1@h|pg||
nt|mugsmate: One bid hand, so yes, double is best quick description.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|joest: very same auction in the other room|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|swanson: Moss's hand has gotten worse from the auction.  QJ doubleton in an opponents long suit is a strong negative.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Bocchi/Duboin used to play 2D as 4S5H in this auction - not sure what strength.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|mugsmate: But certainly limited.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mariner1: I think its hard to stay out of 4@S so 3@S has to be good, though it might lose imps|pg||
