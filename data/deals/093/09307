nt|Vugraphu2: /we are off it is yours commentators.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: I suppose N-S might overbid to the heart game. It has some play single dummy.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|jbgood: on a natural club lead I guess making 4 would need a miracle|pg||
nt|brolucius: North has bid conservatively, as Ed predicted.  |pg||
nt|brolucius: He had a five-loser hand, so we can expect the other North to make a game try at least.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|royhughes: and a good guess in trumps is required to make even 3|pg||

nt|xenya: true|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: ther you are|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|othered1: Conservative initial actions.  Otherwise normally aggressive.  |pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
mc|9|nt|brolucius: A kibitzer makes the point that playing the (dreaded) Flannery convention - 2@D to show 4-5 in the majors, South would be declarer and there would be more chance of avoiding two ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: quick club losers.|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: played by?|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|royhughes: If NS play 3@h as preemptive, then 3@c shows a limit raise or better|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|jbgood: another diciplined auction|pg||
nt|othered1: Two of those 4=5s in a row.  Lack of a gadget opening didn't hurt them on the first and probably won't here, either.|pg||
nt|royhughes: Seamon's signoff confirms that they play sound openings -- this would be extra values for many pairs|pg||
nt|brolucius: No need for a gadget when you have 4 spades and 5 hearts, as Reese used to point out.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|swanson: Not a good effort by N-S.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peter Gill taking no chances with the @S finesse -- 5@C making 5 is nice score|pg||
nt|werge: In my world, North has two 5-cards suits...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: this is Open Pairs so we will not have scores shown......|pg||
nt|swanson: E-W will likely be off one in 2@S here.  Dangerour for SOuth to enter vulnerable with weak minor suits.|pg||
nt|mariner1: weak NT by E|pg||
nt|forni: really?|pg||
nt|forni: if North had 5-5, in my world he would've started off with 1@H|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: Yamada-Ohno have been playing together for 30+ years. In Beijing their team won the Senior Event|pg||
mb|1N|nt|forni: so 6-5 is probable|pg||
mb|2H|nt|janm: West will probably transfer to spades... wrong again!|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: hi all    little bit of a late start|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: with the void and the heart fit, i don;t think i could bid less than 3S with the W hand|pg||
nt|npcjpn: no hope for tenth:)|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|mariner1: the distribution here helps the effort in 3@C|pg||
nt|werge: I meant, I will show the hand as 5-5!|pg||
mb|3H|nt|forni: ahh|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: @SA on side, @c 3 3 , @D 3 3 with Q@D in pocket|pg||
nt|swanson: I would have preferred to pass with the South hand with the plan of making a takeout double of hearts if E-W try to play at the two level.|pg||
nt|mariner1: the @H lead works for defense for taps|pg||
nt|janm: 2NT seems a pretty big position to take certainly|pg||
nt|mariner1:  http://www.qldbridge.com/gcc/           tournament site  -|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or else 2NT, followed by 3S (depending on agreements)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play a Weak NT and an uncommon 2@D opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we should be able to follow most of the other auctions|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: N has the hand I like ot be able to bid a nonforcing 2H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after the jump to 4S, Pass by E would surely be forcing, so W should really pass here|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Bakkeren asking about the 2NT bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like lebbish|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Bakkeren in the tank|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so that is what it is|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: in the tank.....|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Bakkeren ...thinking|pg||
nt|sybarra: challenging hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: just in case S has some 6/4 red suited hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be in the tank also |pg||
nt|marlowepi: if W was asking about the 2NT bid, i would guess he was just stalling for time. it is pretty obvious what kind of hand N has|pg||
pc|hA|nt|npcjpn: they play 2@c as a puppet to 2@d, usually a start of a sign-off, hence 2@d is Stayman.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|sybarra: who is a 5 @S bidder? |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|janm: How greedy should N be?|pg||
nt|santyclz: An inspired or foolish bid, depending on the result.|pg||
nt|mariner1: agreed, the VUL position vs NV might indicate prudence here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|swanson: The cards are lying quite well for N-S and declarer is forced to take advantage of it.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pass by E would have been forcing|pg||
nt|forni: well I have to agree with you on that one :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: well, i like playing that NF, but i would still pass 2D|pg||
nt|cindy: sometimes partner has the perfect hand where we can make 4H|pg||
nt|keylime: evening everyone|pg||
nt|cindy: hi|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello Cindy, Marshall and Dwayne|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with only 3HCP in my 2 suits and no spade spots, i would not be eager to advance the bidding. i doubt we are missing a game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi roland|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi and welcome to the 2nd segment of the seminfinal form the Gold Coast|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|an|15 limit.|nt|brolucius: They are swimming against the tide a bit. Most players nowadays bid more aggressively.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|royhughes: Will De Knijff play for penalties here?|pg||
nt|othered1: I think they liberalize overcalls opposite a passed h and.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: n-s discussing.|pg||
mb|1S|an|1n transfer|nt|xenya: well it's quite a normal overcall, non-vulnerable, too |pg||
nt|reisig: liberal?  an ace better than mine! :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: 1@s must be some kind of transfer|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|othered1: colors aren't exactly favorable for playing for a 1-level penalty.  But opposite a limited opening, game chances might also be limited.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: transfer to NT primarily|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: East was quite conservative -- the QJ832 is strong|pg||
pc|hK|nt|brolucius: East was a shade good for '1NT' but he was entitled to take off a point or so for the singleotn diamonds and the knowledge that his five-card suit was breaking badly against him.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|royhughes: But NS have an easy 5 tricks when they shift to spades|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|royhughes: So this is another quiet hand in the play|pg||
nt|reisig: maybe not|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|brolucius: South might have retained the @SK as an entry for the 13th spade.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|royhughes: yes, that would have been better, or shifting to diamonds|pg||
pc|h3|nt|royhughes: but it's just 30 a trick|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h9|pg||
mc|9|nt|brolucius: 30 a trick, yes, but you have to allow something for impressing 1186 kibitzers.|pg||
pg||

nt|mariner1: off 1 might score some,,, not easy to see|pg||
nt|mariner1: very true John..........|pg||
nt|swanson: Two 10% results for N-S in my judgment.|pg||
nt|mariner1: when is an aggressive contract its usually best to try to make it.......|pg||
nt|nickf: Hi - we'll see North's daughter later on I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: when in|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, shirley, i was wondering too, since 2S seems like such an underbid|pg||
nt|sybarra: it didnt show the shape imo |pg||
nt|sybarra: but oh well,  |pg||
nt|sybarra: someone brought out the goulash dealer?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: checking conditions -- the semi-final will be 4-10 board segments|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@H here for E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Another 5-6|pg||
nt|forni: yeap|pg||
nt|forni: and it'll become interesting what one would bid with S after 1@C|pg||
nt|forni: I'm very fond of bidding known 2-suiters|pg||
mb|1C|nt|marlowepi: a spec suggested that W might have deliberately underbid, walking the dog. but S had shown his hand and N was marked with only a few points. so it easily could have gone all pass|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|werge: Here, North is the best to be declarer in 3 NT|pg||
nt|forni: so if I could bid 2@C or 3@C or 2NT or 3@D as @S+@D, I would surely do so.|pg||
nt|forni: But|pg||
nt|forni: I don't realise... my 1@C is forcing, and it's actually kinda normal that E would open a strong 2@C :P|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: p p p|pg||
nt|forni: now E has an interesting problem|pg||
mb|3C|nt|keylime: N-S may get a little nudge here into game|pg||
nt|cindy: yes|pg||
nt|cindy: N wouldnt pass 3C anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: Fiona Brown, who came 4th in World Mixed Pairs a few years ago when just 22|pg||
nt|forni: yes blackwould would surely do, I always think too difficult|pg||
nt|forni: :S|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i would be very nervous of cidding just 3C with the S hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my methods, pass is strong inaction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now THAT is surprising -- I thought Yamada would double again|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: THree boards per round I believe, then we get new players (at least different players).|pg||
nt|cindy: i bet he was starting to sweat a little|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|mariner1: Fiona was also an excellent Vugraph Operator during the Yeh Cup!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|swanson: This delayed raise by East generally is used to show a solid values for 2@H.|pg||
nt|keylime: 3@c seens a little conservative to me as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: letting the opponents play 2-level in 8 card fit tends to lose more than it gains|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect he was trying to walk the dog|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cindy: would you just forget the club suit and bid 4H ?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|swanson: With less, East is required to simply raise 1@H to 2@H and forget about spades.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|keylime: I would bid clubs, to cater to short hearts - with seven of them, and the side club suit, I want to clue pard in to my hand; I certainly will have probably one more bid|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sunsamvar: Has to use the sparse entries to dummy wisely|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: and as we see 3@D is excellent contract|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would probably bid 4C ovber 2D|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h5|pc|cJ|nt|keylime: 4@c may have been a splinter tho hence the 3@c call|pg||

nt|brolucius: Maybe it was a psychological ploy, to persuade E-W that they had missed a game.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|d|an|penalty|nt|brolucius: That is over 2000 eyes staring at them - intimidating.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: penalty double is attractive, but I'll bet someone runs|pg||
nt|othered1: passing with north's hand is taking a risky position, to my eyes|pg||
nt|royhughes: NS are just a club pip away from being able to make a lot of tricks in 1N|pg||
mb|2C|nt|othered1: After EW take the first 8|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jbgood: E rather unlucky with the spade split..|pg||
nt|othered1: I think the self-rescue is normal bridge.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: very much so|pg||
nt|royhughes: I agree -- too likely to be off the spade suit|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|royhughes: Now a nice stop by the Swedes|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||

pc|h7|nt|Vugraphu2: thinking|pg||

nt|nickf: Barometer|pg||
nt|swanson: N-S are on for game here but it will not be asy to bid.|pg||
nt|janm: Especially if West starts with 2@s|pg||
nt|mariner1: well with only 7 pairs we could have a Howell or similar|pg||
nt|nickf: the scorers hope to provide almost real time scores|pg||
nt|janm: So much for 2@s|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: bid out of term and accepted|pg||
nt|keylime: I'd be thrilled to have pard give me honor-doub of my first suit with South's hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this vulnerability  2@S-1 and 3@D=  get same score  so  NS right again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no surprise -- Gill's 5@C contract on board 1 is a game swing|pg||
nt|forni: I'd say that east has a hand good enough for a 18-19 rebid, thus opening 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: players are using bridgemates|pg||
nt|cindy: S has a dandy hand here   |pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: aha!|pg||
nt|werge: To me, West has the hand for a directly 4 @S-bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: 1 @D the "yucky" hand |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: N/S are playing weak NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Gill plays transfer openings in some partnerships, but I didn't think this was one of them|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: finally a game contract that has decent chances to make|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mariner1: make that 14 pairs 7 tables|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 2@h is a limit for NS with careful defence.|pg||
nt|werge: But better let E/W play here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|marlowepi: at first glance it may look like S  should rebid 4H, then bid 5C over 4S. but that does not have to be a suit--it could even be a void. so S wanted to bid clubs at his second turn. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: odd for a 7-5 hand to be awkward to bid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3nt ofcourse depends on locating the @Cq|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: sorry :)|pg||
nt|forni: I can agree with that|pg||
nt|forni: And even though East has a great hand if West would've bid 4@S directly, he doesn't nearly have enough aces to continue over 4@S|pg||
nt|werge: The danger is, that North - after 1 @S - can bid a leas-directing suit|pg||
nt|werge: lead-directing|pg||
nt|forni: N can bid a lead-directing suit for if W becomes declarer?|pg||
nt|werge: East MUST have showed the hand allready|pg||
nt|forni: The trouble for Peake now is: Why can't west have AKxxxx, Jxx, xx, Axx|pg||
nt|werge: OK, sleepy...|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: in the last set  they doubled 1D and meant it for takeout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this makes 5 of either minor - but only because of lucky @C position|pg||
nt|forni: that's why 4@S over 1@C is better.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: this time apparently it means diamonds|pg||
nt|npcjpn: sure.|pg||
nt|werge: 7 easy tricks against 3 @C|pg||
nt|werge: - but East might be declarer in three other suits|pg||
nt|forni: plus NS could find their 5-red save.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cindy: kokish i guess|pg||
nt|keylime: valid point Marshall - |pg||
nt|keylime: looks like it doesn't it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: judging by the N bidding, it still means takeout|pg||
pc|c2|nt|swanson: Seems like a losing system to not be able to get that spade suit of Wes't in the auction immediately.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H over 1@S is interesting to me..... not passing to try penalty|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|keylime: Kokish for those that don't know is 2@c-2@d-2@h, where hearts are either natural, or showing a specific range of balanced hand|pg||
nt|cindy: kokish makes these big balanced hands easier to bid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the @d overcall and support have steered them to 4@H|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|janm: Interesting decision for South when East opened out of turn - I wonder if he'd have done better to have the bidding revert to West|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: I think it was a slip of attention for both|pg||
nt|keylime: hence the forced 2@s call.|pg||
nt|werge: Did´nt West bid his hand twice (at least..)|pg||
nt|werge: This will be 5 @S probably one down - @d- to the ace and misguessing the @C-suit|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: hi zh |pg||
pc|sA|nt|cindy: yes  it was N last time that doubled for takeout and S thought it was diamonds|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry privie|pg||
nt|cindy: they didnt discuss apparently|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since i'm the only commentator -- if there are things you'd like me to cover rather than random raving -- just send me a chat message|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cindy: didnt matter here since N chose to not Stayman|pg||
nt|keylime: named after the brilliant Canadian theorist, Eric Kokish.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is 2S 100% forced, then? i'm thinking it's better if N can bid 3H with spades, to get the play in the S hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: either before or after the misundersatnding|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Ohno beat the Hackett team (MELBOURNE - DE LIVERA - HIRST - HACKETT - BAKKEREN - BERTENS) this morning in a 24 board match  to make the semi finals |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|cindy: 8 card fit and lots of hcp but slam would be very difficult|pg||
nt|cindy: 2S is forced in kokish|pg||
nt|keylime: normally when i got to play Kokish it was almost 100% forced, unless I had a single suiter or certain 2 suiters.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe Yamada needed to raise to 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that would probably only make the auction less convincing|pg||
nt|npcjpn: south's first pass was a surprise.|pg||
nt|forni: that's not impossible :)|pg||
nt|werge: With thusd dummy, North can´t play others than a @C NOW|pg||
nt|forni: remember I called that 4@D with north's "5-5" in the red suits not the right contract? Other table decided to bid up to 5@D, winning 5 imps for Ohno.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|davidstern: This event started with 246 teams. Six survived after 10 rounds of 10 boards. Top 2 to the semi-finals and the remaining four playing off for the other two spots|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cindy: wouldnt it sort of defeat the purpose if 2S not forced ?|pg||
nt|keylime: open room is about to start on board 1, so we're going to have comparisons soon.|pg||
nt|werge: He smelled the misfit|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|swanson: The problem with trying for a penalty is that N-S surely have a minor suit fit and might be able to take a lot of tricks there - as they can here.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|davidstern: Lavazza Red Bocchi/Madala/Sementa/Duboi finished 7th|pg||

nt|keylime: certain hands like, both minors, can be hard over a strong 2@c hand|pg||
nt|keylime: hard to bid I meant|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no, i don;t think so. it ought to be possible to arrange alternative structure so that N & S can rveeal their hands while still allowing S to be declarer|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: i don't think it would matter|pg||

nt|othered1: Right, but to pass  you'd need to know that in advance|pg||
nt|xenya: 1N would have made with an overtrick perhaps|pg||

nt|keylime: I had to go retrieve a guest downstairs :-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Horwitz wants to bid -- but  nothing available|pg||

mb|p|nt|swanson: Most experts around here respond with the South hand.  There is minimal playing strength but passing mades life so easy for the opponents.|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 2NT seems like a lot to bid on that hand|pg||
pc|cT|nt|cindy: i wouldnt bid with S hand |pg||

nt|sybarra: was just going to make same comment |pg||
nt|marlowepi: but this is cold on the intrafinesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: seemed really optimistic|pg||
nt|npcjpn: but it may not so easy, 3@c does not promise a solid suit.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mariner1: 2N will not fare well here ,,,,, to much out and off|pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart king, then D to the 9|pg||

pc|cK|nt|keylime: I have nightmares of -500 in a partial with South's hand|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i would bid. |pg||
pc|c8|pg||

nt|ahollan1: this won't be as easy as the @C games|pg||
pc|cA|nt|swanson: If you Google Yeh 2009 you can find the site for the tournament.|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.yehcup09.com.au/  - Tournament site|pg||
nt|keylime: I think to be fair, it depends on the NT defense|pg||
nt|keylime: if you're a DONT user - 2@d fits the bill |pg||
nt|npcjpn: so depends on a lead.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|werge: Difficult to find the @s-lead|pg||
nt|npcjpn: bravo!|pg||
nt|werge: Voila - as the say in France|pg||
pc|c2|nt|swanson: Declarer might will guess diamonds - after all SOuth did pass 1@H.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome Dave!|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|swanson: well|pg||
nt|mariner1: that is the Yeh Cup site|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you could have a game opposite very little. and when you have this shape it is unlikely they will double before bidding something|pg||

nt|marlowepi: club ace , club and N is down|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes the @S switch on the previous bd allowed the game to keep|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|swanson: The @D8 discard will chinch it.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: do we know what the problem is Fiona ?|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|keylime: I'm swayed by what pard does admittedly. I'm use to opening light in my regular p'ship; his pass probably sways me here instead of me tabling 2@d (which is diamonds and hearts for ...|pg||
nt|keylime: us)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|hA|nt|sunsamvar: the interesting boards are coming up. so hold on to the edge of your seats|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|swanson: So 5 diamonds and one in each of the other suits for declarer.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it seems very anti-percentage to start with the ace of diamonds|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the very fact that you are vul means that partner's top end is higher. here you would be a favorite to make game oppsite Qxxxx of hearts|pg||
nt|npcjpn: but North has to find six discard....|pg||
mc|9|nt|santyclz: He pitched a @d from dummy.|pg||
nt|janm: Still looks as if this is going down (only 4 diamonds, since declarer pitched one on a heart)|pg||
nt|cindy: all of my partners open anything that moves so we might miss a part score but thats ok with me|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||

mc|10|nt|xenya: he doesn't know about all those @Ds...|pg||
nt|royhughes: In any event, good deceptive bidding by the Swedes|pg||
nt|brolucius: Lucky for them that the five-card hearts were not on lead.|pg||
pg||

nt|marlowepi: and while we are speaking of the colors, E has opened a NT at favorable, which could be anything, especially for a dutch pair|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still - as Dave said, this could be good against NS @S partscore|pg||
mb|1D|nt|swanson: North will be under the miguided assumption that this deal belongs to his side.|pg||
nt|cindy: i know |pg||
nt|keylime: very true Marshall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm a 2@D bidder -- how about you Dave?|pg||
nt|mrdct: the @S suit likely to prevail here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@H has play here EW...... no Save NS|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: which means, i think, that the odds on bidding are nowhere near as terrifying as has been suggested|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lol   i thought they were in 3NT. to me it looks so automatic for N to bid 3NT over 2NT that i didnt even bother to check the rest of the auction|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: not sure what problem is :) In the Cayne match|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: micheals. most use micheals for weak(below opening hand) or 16 + hands.|pg||
nt|forni: looks like 4@S by NS|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mrdct: not a great @D suit but there are 6 of them so 2@D looks OK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when able to make overcall in suit just under opening bid -- because of preemptive value, it can be weaker than other 2 level overcalls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S a practical bid -- with EW showing 8+@S partner strong favorite to have some @S length|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think gill needs to bid again with this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  EW 8+@H -- but you knew that|pg||
nt|werge: If thisd is a weak-two - this beats the world record|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: terrifying for me   i would bid if that outside stuff were in my long suits|pg||
nt|mrdct: even though he is red vs green|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the north hand falls in between and most wd call the suits in turn|pg||
nt|forni: but|pg||
nt|werge: Here 4 @S is making N/S with only 16 HCP|pg||
nt|forni: I'm wrong|pg||
mb|2S|nt|keylime: I'd like the K@c in my diamonds. Then I'm bidding freely.|pg||
nt|forni: 3 rounds of @H will promote @SJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: moreover, bidding VASTLY increases the chances that PARTNER will get to be on lead, which is a very good thing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would he still bid 2D if he had 250 honors?|pg||
nt|sybarra: should we pour you another glass of wine?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, pleaseeeeeeeeeeeee|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: how many votes for 3nt and how many for 4@H with the south hand ?|pg||
nt|werge: Yes, 3 rounds of H ist the killing defence - when East ruffs with the @S Jack|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: interesting -- when i began reading books/magazines from England "green" meant favorable vulnerability|pg||
nt|mrdct: trump lead by gill might be best - althogh he has a slight problem in that department|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  not-vul vs vu|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now that i know of other parts of the world - they use it "green" = not-vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: was 2H forcing by N ?|pg||
nt|keylime: I have a glass of Lake Anna Sunset currently in hand|pg||
nt|npcjpn: probably with 2@d multi, 2@h shows sound weak two. |pg||
pc|s4|nt|janm: EW will probably think that N was kidding with the 1NT bid|pg||
nt|keylime: but I wonder if they are playing IJO's|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cindy: not liking 3H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what did S think 2D was? if she couldn;t open the bidding surely she couldn;t bid 3H on a misfit, so she must have thought 2D was something else|pg||
nt|cindy: im happy defending |pg||
pc|sK|nt|mariner1: 5@C DBL would have been 500 however N has to much defense to save|pg||
nt|mrdct: north might put the @HJ on the tbale now|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 053|pg||
nt|npcjpn: sorry, private.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 3@c promises some values with 2NT lebensohl.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|keylime: 5@d looks to be a decent spot here|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|swanson: Unsupported aces are not often good leads, but here there is a reasonable chance that either the king is in dummy or that North can give partner a ruff.|pg||
nt|santyclz: @c continuation makes this very tough if possible at all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H before touching trump to ensure 2 or 3 ruffs in dummy|pg||
nt|werge: 3 NT and 5 @C both should make|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mrdct: west probably not keen on playing a trump from Qxx now|pg||
nt|mrdct: all very much looking like an easy make now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now play is just for overtrick|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|keylime: pushes as expected on boards 1 and 2 hence the no score.|pg||
nt|sybarra: esp. when I know what to lead |pg||
nt|ahollan1: mid @S looks automatic -- if Gill follows suit, no harm|pg||
nt|forni: Ohno will take the lead by ending in 4@S on board 14, where Gill went down one in 5@S|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|nt|vugrapha3: some music started playing outside so play stopped :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: diamonds are forever :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cindy: 3/2 diamonds makes it easy|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|keylime: I asked Larry, who's my regular pard about the 5-5 red hand, he states he's coming in due to decent loser count. Ironically, he's more conservative than I am most of the time. :-)|pg||
nt|cindy: would anyone lead the K of hearts with W hand ?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mariner1: now a @c and defense prevails|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: if nobody is dancing -- it doesn't count|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: keep the dangerous east out|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sunsamvar: once the @S king was seen with east he can be sure that the @C top honours are with west..|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S buys a dummy for 3H that is about two tricks better than par on this auction|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so good safety play|pg||
pc|c7|pc|sQ|pc|d4|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|keylime: B3: 4@h got doubled and racked for 690|pg||

nt|marlowepi: oy-oy tendencies?|pg||

nt|jbgood: but one down of course - there is still one diamond ruff to come|pg||
nt|othered1: 3rd seat opening need not have full values|pg||

nt|santyclz: May save a few mps.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the other point is this--if you plkay a very aggressive style, as the dutch do, and iuf both partners want to keep palying it, then you simply have to give a lot more leeway & let ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some of the doubles get away from you|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Ohno 4 more ims on 16|pg||
nt|mrdct: so that board is potential gain for ohno if thay bid game next door|pg||
nt|ahollan1: contract was ok at that point - could ruff in dummy exit with loser and still have trump KJ intact|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: as the @s ruff provides the back entry for the @DA and club discard|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: he is ok becos @C lenght is on his left|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: ok back to 18 now :)|pg||
nt|npcjpn: nine tricks for both sides.|pg||
nt|werge: I hope, they play with screens...|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: NS playing weak notrump. but this North hand is too strong for strong notrump.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: screens are up :)|pg||
nt|forni: sound-proof screens? Or did Peake hear Gill screaming?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sunsamvar: there they go again bidding opps suit :)|pg||
nt|werge: Seems to be a weak opening|pg||
nt|forni: very|pg||
nt|forni: but|pg||
nt|forni: as the cards lie... 4@H makes.|pg||
nt|werge: Not on a trump leas - and more of them|pg||
nt|werge: lead|pg||
nt|forni: unless NS decide to lead trump|pg||
nt|forni: hehe|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: 3NT was anti-field - I believe one should just take their best shot to make the contract in that situation.|pg||
nt|janm: Doesn't seem as if "field" was too likely to be relevant - they were in a fairly anti-field contract, unless weak NT is more common in this field than most?|pg||
nt|mrdct: 9 tricks on top in 3NT|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: here most people would bid 2H as S, showing INV + in clubs|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: and 5 more on 17|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are a million things that can go wrong, in the layout or in the defence. after all, if you had clearly misdefended two games already (as W did in the first set), would you be ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so quick to double?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 5 boards to go here|pg||
nt|werge: We are back to 9 tricks each way|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well in Oz with transfer openers and bids its hard to tell :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously NS have had 2 hands too strong and zero that fit (11)12-14 opener or 15-17 rebid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will they rech the good 6@C here ?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|swanson: Pass first|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: honours lying badly for declarer and that dooms the good 5@C contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: not uncommon|pg||
nt|keylime: South might like her hand a lot now|pg||
nt|npcjpn: very cautios pass by Green.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|nickf: was 1S-1NT-P 2S-2S-3H|pg||
nt|cindy: not that much i guess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this hand shows the power of shape and aces, NS making 6C with only 22 working HCP|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: she passed very quickly|pg||
nt|npcjpn: if West's minor reversed...|pg||
nt|werge: West should be declarer - trump lead is more difficult for Nortth than for Souht|pg||
nt|forni: true|pg||
nt|forni: but they're not in game, so it really doesn't matter anymore. Too bad, could've used some more exitement|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: but mandatory in NZ where I think they come from|pg||
nt|janm: I think we're one player off here - N opened 1@s|pg||
nt|nickf: Ally, undo the auction|pg||
nt|swanson: Aren't we off by 90 degrees in the bidding here?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: can they get to 6@D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duck once -- let Horwitz find correct pointed [@S/@D] shift|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|vugrapha3: just kidding ....:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stripe-tailed ape in passout seat|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely 2 @D was inverted |pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am guessing yes. E will like his aces and W will like his trumps and controls|pg||
nt|sybarra: I.e.  =good hand|pg||
nt|keylime: I think you get there once you hear the spade ace|pg||
nt|sybarra: is that inverted?  I should have looked closer |pg||
nt|werge: Nor 4 @D-.tricks possible|pg||
nt|forni: he'll have to play the @D for 4 tricks to make game|pg||
nt|forni: duck a club now|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i assumed it was a simple raise|pg||
nt|mrdct: should make 10 tricks now as the @S finesse is safe|pg||
nt|npcjpn: will shift to spades, I guess.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if K is strong lead -- then Gill has a) denied @HJ  and b) shown doubleton |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: now can duck @D for squeeze that doesn't materialize|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|keylime: declarer will be happy about the 3-0 spade break with the A@c safely tucked away|pg||
nt|keylime: club break I meant|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i don;t think so.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: declarer would probably prefer for 6 not to be cold|pg||
nt|keylime: quite true. |pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: and taaaaaaaaadaaaaaaaaaa|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: whatever the bids meant,  wd to e/w |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: there are many players who would upgrade the W hand due to the long suit and open 2NT. this hand is an excellent example of why that is so wrong. 2NT openers are slam-killers. here ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E woiuldn;t dream of slam in a million years over 2NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this hand also shows some of the weakness of the point-count. with only 19 HCP, W actually has a better hand in a sense than a 2NT opener because of the long suit and the controls|pg||
nt|cindy: crashed :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this match might now be about even when these last two are compared|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome back|pg||
nt|cindy: ty|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what woke you?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mariner1: good cash for the defense here|pg||
nt|mrdct: might duck a @S now to set up a potential red suit squeeze on west|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s5|nt|keylime: declarer will probably play a@h, heart ruff A@d, diamond ruff, heart ruff|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mrdct: @D i mean|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: but i think most would have lead @HQ for unblock or count |pg||

pc|c9|pg||
mc|9|nt|sunsamvar: now with the bad break in @D he is down even if the @Ha was favourable|pg||
nt|forni: ruffing a @C would mean 9 tricks|pg||

nt|brolucius: A struggle but...           +420.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: seems as if we may disregard most entries from the CR|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't expect this North to open 2@S.|pg||

nt|jbgood: who knows? It surely isnt standard:)|pg||
mb|3H|an|3-4-5-1|mb|p|nt|royhughes: It seems 2@d showed x45x and 3@h shows 3451|pg||
nt|xenya: EW may climb too high here...|pg||
nt|royhughes: I never liked this sort of think with a singleton king|pg||
nt|xenya: W knowing about the singleton club|pg||
nt|brolucius: Slam is not so bad if West can arrange to play it, protecting the spade honours from the lead.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p!|mb|4H|nt|othered1: But they've managed to wrong-hand @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Unless you start with the obscure sequence 1@D - 1@H, it is too difficult.|pg||
nt|jbgood: it even makes on W's hand - slam|pg||
nt|royhughes: and ask for a spade lead, too|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: It's normal for Wrang to bid slam, of course|pg||
pc|s5|nt|royhughes: We see how the spades lie -- and now he will!|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||
nt|royhughes: 6@h by West would have been complicated|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is better than 50% that you will get the spades right because when themissing honours are split, you have the inference that South will not underlead the ace.|pg||
nt|jbgood: so the realy answer got the contract wrong handed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We lost the closed room for a while. Back now|pg||
nt|royhughes: I was asked why a spade lead was indicated -- it is declarer's side 3-card suit|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|brolucius: On this sort of deal, it is complete luck whether you happen to right-side the contract. |pg||
mc|11|nt|Vugraphu2: Break time now.|pg||
nt|brolucius: If East had held the spade honours we would be saying how clever they had been to get East as the declarer.|pg||
nt|royhughes: That's true, but I wonder if West had alternatives to 2NT which might have right-sided the slam.  He was looking at the spade KJ|pg||
nt|othered1: west might have known right off that it would be good to protect the @S tenace.  Could he have managed an auction to ensure his playing it while still investigating slam?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: East west walk away discussing the hand.|pg||
nt|jbgood: on no 8 the start of the play went as in this room in 4 hearts, but in on the spade king west returned a small club. Queen, ace and a ruff beat it|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's not attractive, in general, to distort your bidding in the hope that you may right-side some future contract.|pg||
nt|othered1: You need tons of detail about their system to know if that judgment were available|pg||
nt|royhughes: If the 2@d opening showed short clubs (I'm still not sure), then the odds were good that East had a spade card|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|xenya: and it seems they couldn't rightside it here as 2@H from W would have been non-fotcing -- or so it looks|pg||
nt|brolucius: Give South the @SQ on that last board and the Swedish team might be some 26 IMPs better off. It was rather unlucky.|pg||
nt|royhughes: It certainly was|pg||
nt|brolucius: It seems that the Italians never looked for a slam.|pg||
nt|xenya: not after N bid 2@S, no|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, I see, North bid 1@S. Yes, well that does change things. I had missed that.|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@S of course|pg||

nt|mrdct: and has improved her bridge significantly during that period|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: sorry boards put in wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: she has won back to back National Open Teams playing with Gill|pg||
nt|npcjpn: her debut was 1976 olympiad in Monaco.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugrapha3: short break|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: we are on again|pg||
nt|werge: When I started playing bridge, South did NOT have an opening hand...|pg||
nt|forni: good ending for EW in open|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I'm not sure whether the 1NT is strong, and N upgraded, or weak and N decided it wasn't worth more than 1NT - I'll bet the former, though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm trying to remember -- was Horwitz team winner of recent NOT [where Peter was winning his 3rd straight trophy]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops  -- i was typing while Dave was already answering the question|pg||
nt|mrdct: i don't believe she has ever played in an olympiad|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I haven't seen this treatment before|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - East should be partner with South here|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: they are playing board nine :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|npcjpn: she has played mant times in Olympiad in open category.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and why no 1N opener from North??|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mrdct: nobody plays anything natural over a 1@C opening these days|pg||
nt|werge: Can West stay out of game - 14 HCP facing an opening hand...|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mariner1: weak NT allows the auction to be jacked up quick again|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lovely position for w to be in vul vs not.|pg||
nt|keylime: B6 in the open room now|pg||
mb|2S|nt|swanson: I think a trump lead is necessary here to stop game in spades.|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS should score well here|pg||
nt|swanson: BUt, of course, you first have to enter the auction.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H has play, so a make is really big her|pg||
nt|mariner1: here|pg||
nt|keylime: 2@d looks to be the Multi here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my bet -- Fiona misclick    1N-P-2@C puppet to 2@D makes more sense|pg||
nt|mrdct: the 1@C opening might include weak NT hands|pg||
nt|npcjpn: yes, AL, after 1NT opening, thier 2@c is puppet to 2@d.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|npcjpn: ok, will see board eight later.|pg||
nt|forni: there we go, more trouble for the Aussies|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: they have missed 18 :) |pg||
nt|werge: That´s the price for East double|pg||
nt|werge: East´s|pg||
mb|4H|nt|npcjpn: usually start of a sign-off in a suit.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: one or three club opening?|pg||
nt|werge: This can´t be the bidding - 4 @c from West!?!|pg||
nt|npcjpn: looks normal if the opening bid was 3@c|pg||
nt|werge: Sure|pg||
nt|forni: NS will be able to take the first 6 tricks.|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: One reason that West could consider 4@S is that partner will have at most a singleton heart on the auction.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: maybe 1 nt would have been better? |pg||
nt|sybarra: easy from here |pg||
nt|cindy: 2H seems auto to me with N hand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: that is another option |pg||
pc|dA|nt|swanson: Still, there is that dark red on the boards looking at West.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: i think i understand the bidding through 1S after that i am lost|pg||
nt|cindy: agree|pg||
nt|keylime: I would have bid 1NT, if not, honor-9 isn't bad for 2@h|pg||
nt|mrdct: this is a pretty handy start to the match for Horwitz|pg||

nt|marlowepi: EW would be playing 1S against me|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|othered1: normal raise or some type of "lawful" thing?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: To make four, you would need to somehow set up a heart discard on the diamonds.|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|othered1: What's EW's NT range?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: East has a pure hand for a preempt, I suppose, but both opponents have passed|pg||
nt|jbgood: hmm - wonder what 3 spades was|pg||
nt|royhughes: West seems to have taken it for a limit raise or so|pg||
nt|brolucius: Since West has bid game, it cannot have been a pre-empt. Must be cloase to a full-value normal 3@S. |pg||
pc|d4|nt|royhughes: Here's one of those situations where you don't want partner to have underled an ace|pg||

nt|royhughes: East's diamond 7 could be a trick -- did he really play it?|pg||
nt|jbgood: throwing the seven - was that a good idea?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S was a slight overbid, with three jacks and so many losers. But West might well have raised 3@S, holding five trumps.|pg||
nt|royhughes: Declarer chose to encourage a diamond continuation|pg||
nt|xenya: they were destined to wind up in 4|pg||
nt|brolucius: East attempts a Bath Coup, playing the @D7 to make the @D5 look like an encouraging card (if they are playing standard signals, which is unlikely).|pg||
nt|royhughes: But it might cost double-dummy: there might have been 5 spades, 2 hearts, a club and 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: look at the result in CR!|pg||
nt|royhughes: It might still be possible to score a club ruff in the East hand and still pick up the trumps, but unlikely|pg||
