nt|petergill: @SQxx. |pg||
nt|joest: I think Bart will view this as strong enough for 3@s|pg||
mb|5C|nt|swanson: 2NT is a possible choice on the West cards.  THe diamond suit could get shut out by N-S bidding in various auctions.|pg||
nt|joest: or even stronger! :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|sybarra: so folks know,  for the operator, its always a challenge,  the players do not always show their cards, or they play fast and turn them over  |pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: ok will correct asap|pg||
nt|ady: hard to see 3NT succeeding here|pg||
nt|lestergold: a combined 24 points for e/w but even 2n would be a struggle never mind 3|pg||
nt|ady: even of a favourable heart lead|pg||
nt|irwinbo: does everybody bid with 8 points even with 2 four card majors?|pg||
nt|panja: EW do not have a 44 fit...but W has to try to find one...and he could end up too high as a result|pg||
nt|lestergold: experience suggest to me that with 8 points no 5 card suit and poor intermediates that one often only scrapes 7 tricks|pg||

pc|s6|nt|lestergold: how do they stop here in a 4/3 fit? rather than N|pg||

nt|panja: does everyone like the lead?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: i ould have for my sins led a spade|pg||
nt|panja: the problem with a minor suit lead is, E could have 5....and between two minors...@C from JTx should be less risky...but a trump seems better|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|ady: it would seem the 2@H bid showed the value to 2NT with both majors|pg||

mb|p|nt|joest: would you really pass with AKxx AKxxx?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|petergill: No 3@c opening on a 6322 shape - Americans do that sometimes, Europeans tend not to. |pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: This is a dull 3NT.  South could have livened things up with a 3@C preempt.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|joest: I agree with pass.  Boye has plenty of other ways to mix it up.|pg||
nt|petergill: with two doubletons I might pass - heaps of defence, not much offence|pg||
nt|swanson: Spades are a bit good for 3@C - I would certainly bid 3@C without those spade honors.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|petergill: I think it is Benito Garozzo's influence that makes Europeans and Italians tend not to preempt on 6322 shapes.  |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|joest: Norwegians lead 3rd and 5th vs NT|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C X all pass would be what? - 1100, 1400, something like that I think|pg||
nt|swanson: North tries a major - when the opponents arrive in 3NT without bidding a major it implies their minors are good.  And North lacks an entry.|pg||
nt|swanson: It's partner's responsibility to offer more support that North has on this hand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Wold still thinking|pg||

nt|petergill: I think Eddie Wold and Bart Bramley are not a regular partnership, so we do not have a Convention Card for them, but they will be playing Standard. |pg||

pc|c7|pc|d6|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|joest: and knowing Bart, they will be playing VERY standard :)|pg||
nt|swanson: I heard from a reliable source that they had bidding problems in their previous match.|pg||
nt|petergill: Now that South seems to have @SKQ and @CKJ, North will be almost marked with the red queens after South's pass as dealer. |pg||

nt|petergill: Nice duck of @SK earlier by Boye Brogeland. |pg||
nt|joest: it will take some good card reading for Eddie to push this|pg||

mb|2S|nt|janm: Meltzer 41 - Sutherlin 44. I don't know what is being done about the lateness|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6s doubled 3 off for 800 is excellent value against 1430 odd|pg||

mb|3S|nt|petergill: Good shape makes the preempt farily attractive. The nice texture of the spades makes missing a potential heart fit less troublesome. |pg||
nt|swanson: The big preempt with the South hand is 3@S.  That would make life really tough for E-W.|pg||

nt|swanson: A useful convention is to use double by East not as responsive (showing minros) but to ask for a stopper.  Certainly works well with this hand.|pg||

nt|joest: i mean givingup three hearts and two clubs hardly seems the way to go|pg||
nt|swanson: Didn't the play go low heart to the ace and a heart back - declarer now on lead - makes a lot more sense.|pg||
nt|petergill: The play might not be as shown due to the plug problem|pg||
nt|joest: well I did question that :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: something wrong |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|panja: the 4@D-4@H sequence didnt seem like it exchanged a lot of info..|pg||
nt|irwinbo: hearts 2-2 are 40%  clubbs3-3 are 36%  so the slam is 40% plus .6 x36% or about 60%|pg||
nt|ady: orth likely devalued QJ@D   and bad shape|pg||
nt|panja: that is all North did..|pg||
nt|panja: but he did not have a chance to evaluate his @SKQx..or @HK...positively|pg||
nt|lestergold: dummy reversal 3hearts 3 ruffs in hand 4 spades 2 clubs adds to 12 or was that not manageable|pg||

nt|swanson: The second double is obviously not penalty. 3@H offers a choice of contracts but North can't have five spades after his first two bids, so South tried 3NT.|pg||
nt|petergill: North was concerned that Kx or Qx in @H was only one stopper if West had five hearts. |pg||
nt|swanson: This contract makes a lot of sense.  3NT would be in danger if South held the Kx of hearts rather than Ax.|pg||

nt|panja: South could as well discard a @H from Dummy and try to take the @S finesse to make..|pg||
nt|sybarra: and what shape it could be|pg||
nt|ady: I think 4@H can make  if discarding a spade on one of the diamonds    only a club lead beats it|pg||

nt|Vugraphu4: I think you're right that it was about 3@c, but I couldn't tell exactly what was asked or answered|pg||

nt|me argent: the defence can make 3nt|pg||
mb|3S!|an|5-5 !c+!d|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|panja: that lead mike....South was dissuaded by the bidding..|pg||
nt|panja: he didn't fancy finding an Ace with North|pg||
nt|ady: somethin wrong here     mix up whart is forcing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this does indeed look like a slip up |pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w must not have clarified their agreements here no way would west expect east to pass this bid|pg||
nt|me argent: sorry|pg||
nt|mittmouse: no the 9 of s stops that|pg||
nt|me argent: wrong |pg||
nt|me argent: i am that is|pg||
nt|me argent: however 5 of a minor fetches|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sybarra: very unusual for this pair|pg||
nt|irwinbo: another 6 or so for deutsch|pg||
mb|p|nt|mittmouse: y i think they will play 5c|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu4: SOme pairs play this as forcing if they're vulnerable and NF not vul|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: We were just discussing that last night and I mentioned it might lead to accidents :)|pg||
nt|ady: most play change of suit forcing for 1 round    but some alter if their is intervention|pg||

nt|petergill: a spade at Trick 2 might have sent it down 5, but NS are very happy with -1|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|petergill: A routine 4@s to wrap up the match|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|joest: eschewing science|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|petergill: Next up for O'Rourke is Nickell, but the O'Rourke team is playing extremely well and must be a chance of knocking over the top seeds. |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|swanson: Lindvqist and Brogeland and the cards didn't give E-W much chance of making any dent in the lead O'Rourke had at the start of this session.|pg||

mb|p|nt|panja: is it at all likely that 4@H will make?|pg||
nt|ady: bad trump split for a game in hearts here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h a normal contract on the e/w cards perishing  on the 5/0 break|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: Discussion that 3@s was NF because Jacobs could have redoubled to force|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|me argent: mais oui un sans atout|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|me argent: he has the perfect hand for stayman or even pupet stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: On 2Nt, is there a case for 3N by W? I would think there is|pg||
nt|mittmouse: points first shape later|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Vugraphu4: Grue explains he can still be 5-5|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: the double might lead to same score ironically enuf|pg||
nt|panja: in the meantime, the dbl might help|pg||
nt|mittmouse: they probably have a bid where he can respond smolen after opening 1nt|pg||
nt|mittmouse: like int-2c a 3h response shows 4h and 5 s|pg||
nt|me argent: i like 1@S followed by 2@Hs to show that hant georgie|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: it will certainly help it may help too much for south's liking|pg||
nt|panja: still, how should W play?|pg||
nt|panja: @SK and a @D?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: 3@h showed a 6 card suit but not a good one - with a good suit, he would have bid 3@s|pg||
nt|panja: surely, he must try to shorten his hand...|pg||

nt|sybarra: low club?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c2|nt|sybarra: possible make now?|pg||
nt|panja: trump pips are strong for West..|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was a very dangerous double in terms of information provided|pg||
nt|lestergold: and what for at this vulnerability an extra 50 points?|pg||
nt|panja: it was, but the way the play went....information became available on trick two|pg||

nt|Vugraphu5: i just asked for a johnny walker blue on the rocks in a sippy cup  the director smirked and said later|pg||
nt|swanson: 2@S = four spades and longer minor perhaps.|pg||

mb|d|mb|4H|nt|swanson: South wants to save if partner has diamonds.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: still tempted|pg||

nt|Vugraphu5: there was a whisper btwn w-s about 5@c and spades|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: note that the 'longer minor' must be a feature b/c Brogeland did not save with 4@s|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S = "spades and a minor (usually longer)" |pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: from NS Convention Card at http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/OpenTeams/Norway/brogeland-lindqvist.pdf|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|swanson: Five tricks for the defense and eight for the offense.  The dangerous part of saving here is that the opponents might have been oing set in 4@H.|pg||
