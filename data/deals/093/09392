nt|henryb: no|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzkt: max 2 3 4 4 shape|pg||

nt|oosmanb: or a -90 imps dbl?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|farrukh: good dbl for 2 imps minimum|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|oosmanb: well @S lead is the only double dummy lead on which you can not make|pg||
nt|oosmanb: according to GIB|pg||
nt|lestergold: the double is the sort of bid which normally attracts a redouble and make|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: luckily for north no one can redouble and few would make either|pg||
nt|werge: @D to the 10 = 12 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: Squeeze they call it|pg||
nt|lestergold: but with north showing spade length why should east play north for dim length too?|pg||
nt|werge: Almost...|pg||

nt|oosmanb: N better do something then|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is a good point Hans ethical probs created by along tank here|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - but if he doubles, itÂ´s over. With pass - itÂ´s more delicate|pg||
nt|lestergold: whether or not there ae screens a long hesitation can convey significant info inadvertently or unintentionally albeit|pg||
nt|werge: West may have hesitated 10 minutes, but North must cover the remaining 25|pg||

nt|lestergold: 5s is justified without a hesitation from pard but when he knows that partner is willing to play 5s, then that is ethically too much info in my view|pg||
