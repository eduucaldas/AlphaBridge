nt|jallerton: 4@h was aggresive - 3@h would seem more normal as partner might have only 3 hearts and a min|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|xenya: 2N looks obvious to me, but it's their methods|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not right|pg||
nt|jallerton: I suppose Hampson may have considered it slightly too strong for 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: I find it close between dbl and 2N|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|jallerton: hence this auction to show a stronger hand|pg||

nt|royhughes: Yes, he would rather not have his spade ace knocked out|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: Zia (West) in 3NT|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think Hampson will conclude that Nickell would have taken the ace if he had it|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jallerton: If S had @sA he should have played it, so East correct to press on with spades|pg||
nt|xenya: it's normal to play @Ss first as you can almost always keep N off lead in the other suits|pg||
nt|royhughes: This is a decision here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Difficult, Hampson must win this|pg||
nt|royhughes: If he takes the ace of hearts the defence has 5 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Otherwise they can go back to spades|pg||

nt|jallerton: ...or 7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last night Hampson opened 2@C with 7, Greco was also void then|pg||
nt|royhughes: It's sometimes difficult to get to diamonds after a 2@c opening|pg||
nt|xenya: he held a stronger hand though if i remember|pg||
nt|royhughes: This is a great 5@d, even 6 has play|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: But some people would pass 2@c on Greco's hand|pg||
nt|royhughes: as he just did|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|an|T/O|nt|royhughes: Hampson is going to make Freeman pay for balancing|pg||
nt|jallerton: West will catch up now|pg||
nt|xenya: now @Ds are coming into the picture|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not a triumph for the system, but on other occasions 2@C works. However, in my view the 2@C opening in a strong club system is one of the weak points|pg||
nt|royhughes: Since diamonds are 3-0, Greco will need to find the queen of spades if he plays 5@d|pg||
mb|3C|an|Q|nt|Walddk2: so is the 2@D response to 1@C|pg||
mb|3H|an|Q|nt|Walddk2: Zia landed his 3NT on board 3 ... 12 IMPs to Nickell|pg||
nt|royhughes: maybe the clubs can be set up in 5@d, without finding the spade queen|pg||
nt|jallerton: if 2@c shows a single-suiter I think it's a good point, Roland.  Makes life difficult for 2 opponents as well as partner|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: back to back Q|pg||
mb|p!|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes Jeffrey, I was referring to systems where 2@C can contain a 4-card major|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It can in traditional Precision|pg||
nt|royhughes: I wonder if Hampson feels the double of 2@h denies 4 spades|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think this really plays better in the long suit|pg||
pc|hT|nt|xenya: yes, 7 vs 10|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: Nice diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not easy for Nickell to see that he must play low|pg||
nt|jallerton: this will have control problems|pg||
nt|royhughes: Hampson made a takeout double, must have some diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: funny -- the 3-1 @D split ruins 4@S but not 5@D|pg||
nt|jallerton: S knows W has diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he wins the ace, the suit is set up and declarer prevails|pg||
nt|jallerton: he passed over 2@c and then came to life|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He knows because West is dummy :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A Zia redouble in the other room|pg||
nt|jallerton: Good point.  He knows E has made a take-out double of @h|pg||
