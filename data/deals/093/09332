mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: good evening all|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: hey Martin|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we're probably considered the cheap seats tonight|pg||
nt|fabsayc: tossup now whether to bid 2@S or 3@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|fabsayc: they will get more expensive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even though close match -- everybody probably watching  Nickell-Diamond because Nickell DOWN  by 59|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you don't think they will conceed? :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: never|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: just to keep things interestin in round of 64 Nickell came back from halftime deficit of 67  -- 59?  bah|pg||
nt|fabsayc: wow , this auction is strange|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both transferring to @D?     hot potato -- you take it, no you take it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: presumably 3@C showed diamonds and north cue bidding in support|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: lots of explainations|pg||
mb|2S!|an|5|nt|ahollan1: Cayne team the  2 seed has 2 pairs of Italians  ours are  1 &  2 in the WBF world ranking , the other pair  4 &  5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin-Weinstein prefer to win big money tournaments like the Cavendish :)|pg||
mb|p|an|shows 4|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: just kidding   Bobby Levin was youngest to ever win a Bermuda Bowl and Steve Weinstein youngest to win National Event -- both feats as teenagers|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: levin is probably afraid 5@C is making|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: playing exactly same boards,  this match total imps  78,   the other match  179|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expect trump lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well nobody doubled, will keep the scoring low again|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|sybarra2: not sure we will see TRump lead from  |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: wrong again |pg||
nt|sybarra2: E |pg||
mb|4D|nt|sybarra2: afraid to pickle pard|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart was about my last choice from fantoni's hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sigh -- my spy yesterday was wrong - now hearing Levin was ancient 23 when he won BB|pg||
nt|sybarra2: oh god, 23!  anicent |pg||
nt|sybarra2: *ancient|pg||
nt|sybarra2: Meckwell in 3N    Diamond in 3@S on 33 :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: lots of thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you want to multi-task like Shirley -- you can watch all 4 tables simultaneously using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   [one window per table]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: warning, it may take a while to get logged on at that site|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: less than obvious but may need to lead spades now|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: these guys are magic on defense|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mariner1: slam time|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: even the grand|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mariner1: 7@D makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: Let's not go crazy :)|pg||
nt|joest: one thing unusual about this match:  with the exception of the Egyptian pair on the Katz team, this final is almost entirely USA players, a big rarity these days|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@C also makes|pg||
nt|imp_jan: why not? let's have a party :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|joest: reaching 6@d would be doing well|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|imp_jan: 3@d is f (otherwise wolff sign-off with 2n)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I bet 6@D at least|pg||
nt|joest: 3@d rates to be constructive and GF in most natural systems; 2@h often treated as an artificial weak bid|pg||
nt|jallerton: West has a void in partner's suit - a double edged sword|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mariner1: If Moss yanks the 3N then its for slam|pg||
nt|joest: but East's auction has helped his hand by showing: (a) values (b) diamonds (c) some sort of heart control and probably (d) club shortness|pg||
nt|imp_jan: Moss realizes that his partner has values in hearts, not bad for slam...|pg||
nt|joest: not so easy to Blackwood over thsi however|pg||
nt|joest: particularly with a spade void :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: Without @dQ (so only major suit honours) Fred might have bid 2@s or 2NT|pg||
nt|joest: or 2@h if that is their weak call|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 4@C looks reasonable|pg||
nt|joest: four clubs should elicit 4@h from Gitelman|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@C would be my call I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Moss is thinking|pg||
nt|jallerton: this is where regular partnerships gain - they know what partner might do on various borderline hands|pg||
nt|imp_jan: or 4@D, begging for 4@h...|pg||
nt|joest: "strong hands should be bid naturally".  It is really amazing how often that truism works|pg||
nt|reisig: Did 2@d promise @ds???|pg||
nt|jallerton: From West's point of view, can 3NT be the last making contract?|pg||
nt|reisig: Not to me :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Richie I would think so,,,,|pg||
nt|imp_jan: would be strange to go down in 3n with 10xxx of spades in east where 7@d is cold|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: obviously Brad views it differently! :)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: there we are, a modest 6@d|pg||
nt|joest: seven is way too pushy.  Probably a 4-1 break in either minor dooms it|pg||
nt|reisig: I have bid 2@d with 1 @d :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: same auction in Open and Katz bid 4@D over the 3N then 4@H  4N so far|pg||
nt|jallerton: Could E have the same hand with @CQ instead of a low one?|pg||
nt|joest: in the open room Jacobs rebid 2@s instead of raising diamonds|pg||
nt|imp_jan: exactly jeffrey|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 6@D to me implies a risk and he has time to check it out.......|pg||
nt|reisig: with @c Q ...I guarantee - Fred bids 7|pg||
nt|joest: yes he could|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh that's right he did bid @S,,,, was hidden since there was so many rounds of|pg||
nt|mariner1: bidding - in open|pg||
nt|joest: they just reached 7 in the open room|pg||
nt|joest: doubled|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jallerton: for a spade lead?|pg||
nt|joest: i guess|pg||
nt|reisig: bidding 7 is ...well ...lucky|pg||
nt|joest: in the other room Jacobs rebid 2@s and Katz bid 3@c.  Jacobs then took a 3@d preference|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open in 7@D DBL|pg||
nt|jallerton: hardly a convincing start|pg||
nt|imp_jan: great hand to start this match anyway|pg||
nt|reisig: Gotta love the action!|pg||
nt|joest: Ralph later heard his partner cue the heart ace and blackwooded with his void.  When heasked for the queen Jacobs responded 5NT -- the queen and 'something extra'|pg||
nt|imp_jan: as i said, let's party |pg||
nt|mariner1: Hampson DBL with the @SA|pg||
nt|imp_jan: how would we play the grand, btw|pg||
nt|joest: quite a hand to start with|pg||
nt|jallerton: Moss deciding if he can do anything about 4-1 minor suit breaks|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1630 made in Open|pg||
nt|joest: Moss doesn't know it but he's playing for practice|pg||
nt|imp_jan: so the double was more or less gratuit.. (no rdbl)|pg||

nt|mariner1: yes DBL was not costly|pg||
nt|jallerton: Now @dA, club planning to ruff low?|pg||
nt|jallerton: If North has the 4 trumps he may be able to run clubs through North|pg||
nt|joest: that might require playing for that lie|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 7@d is much more easy to play then 6@d :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: interesting that the grand was played in seconds|pg||
nt|joest: easier to play the grand.  Everything either flips out or it doesn't :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=14+ unbal or 15+ bal   1 round force|pg||

nt|jallerton: the latter |pg||
mb|2H!|nt|ritong: beware jack|pg||
nt|joest: 2@h obviously t/o |pg||
mb|2N|nt|ritong: R can react vioàlently to the F word|pg||
nt|joest: I'm in the minority whodoesn't think it's that bad|pg||
nt|ritong: R stands for our own roland|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D must show @H and a minor?|pg||
nt|joest: ah!|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ritong: but you re lucky, he seems to be afk|pg||
nt|jallerton: OK: for Roland: 2@h shows 5@h and 4@s and a minimum opening bid|pg||
nt|joest: it might just be a three suit takeout.  Double tends to show balanced values|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh its flannery|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@D sorry|pg||
nt|mariner1: been so long I forgot|pg||
nt|me argent: or a tox of 2@Hs|pg||
nt|joest: it's tempting to bid but Levin might take him seriously|pg||
mb|d!|nt|joest: and one of the problems with Flannery is trying to distinguish raises|pg||
nt|mariner1: S is Steve Weinstein and not Howard|pg||
nt|joest: ranges|pg||
nt|imp_jan: dbl  probably is inv to game|pg||
nt|imp_jan: as 2n was|pg||
nt|jallerton: It looks like double is intended to show shortage|pg||
nt|joest: double is a good call:  it's a GT but leaves partner well placed to pass if he has a diamond stack|pg||
nt|joest: of course if Levin elects to bid 3NT Weinstein can excuse himself :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: like some play after an overcall of a Jacoby 2NT response to 1major|pg||
nt|joest: but Levin has better passed hands than most.  He passed a hand I know will be opened by Greco-Hampson at the other table|pg||
nt|imp_jan: yes levin-weinstein are solid bidders|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jallerton: But Greco-Hampson play strong @C - normal to open lighter if playing that|pg||
nt|imp_jan: question: what will moss do?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: i like it|pg||
nt|ritong: raise one way or another|pg||
nt|joest: with all his values outside the majors at some point Levin may reach for the doubling cube|pg||
nt|ritong: he certainly will do so if they go to game|pg||
nt|imp_jan: so three out of four made a game try on this one|pg||
nt|joest: Phil, why is the score 27-0 all of a sudden?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Three of them like their hands!|pg||
nt|mariner1: a spirited auction in Open, No DBL yet the deadly 200 anyway|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: 3n = nice safe vs 3@d|pg||
nt|joest: thanks Phil|pg||
nt|ritong: moss will compete|pg||
nt|me argent: best shot|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: 3nt|pg||
nt|joest: would you bid on over 3NT with Moss's hand?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: what a pdship, to pas 3n as south!|pg||
nt|ritong: yes i would|pg||
nt|me argent: good pass|pg||
nt|jallerton: Why should S consider anything else?|pg||
nt|mariner1: does W want to risk a DBL here?|pg||
nt|joest: he may not like it but that's no reason to potentially make matters much worse|pg||
nt|jallerton: Depends how well he plans to defend!|pg||
nt|mariner1: W knows E has something other than @D spots...... as N favored for the bid @D|pg||
nt|reisig: I always try to avoid ..making little hands into big hands (for them)|pg||
nt|jallerton: But do you know this is a 'little hand'?|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: biggest risk of DBL'ing this game is a REDBL|pg||
nt|me argent: can he take the heat?|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: Weinstein may decide to run now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: and then you can pull if nervous|pg||
nt|imp_jan: here we go|pg||
nt|joest: he knows that his double helped fan the flames on this one|pg||
nt|mittmouse: if moss bids 4d will levin dbl if so he will make it on k of h lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: good DBL to me|pg||
nt|jallerton: Which hand could possibly have a redouble?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Both N & S are limited|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: good point george|pg||
nt|mariner1: no one would or did, it was a "what if"|pg||
nt|ritong: brad likes to live dangerously at the table|pg||
pc|d5|nt|imp_jan: defenders have to be carefull|pg||
nt|ritong: very|pg||
nt|jallerton: D lead to ace, D back, Fred should play the jack perhaps|pg||
nt|joest: it will be helpful if Gitelman plays the jack on the diamond return|pg||
nt|imp_jan: and off table as well (brad) :)|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i think they will get this right|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think W can see the S play looking at dummy|pg||
nt|reisig: I'd be amazed if they didn't beat this|pg||
nt|ritong: it is a matter of @d Q|pg||
nt|joest: plus it is not as likely Levin is gamling out 3NT on a single stopper as a passed hand|pg||
nt|ritong: anyways brad will have two chances|pg||
nt|mariner1: J @D on @D return would be great|pg||
nt|joest: there's risk attached to the play but there are big risks in not making it|pg||
pc|c8|nt|imp_jan: let's first squeeze dummy a little (not really)|pg||
nt|jallerton: playing the j would be embarrassing if bobby had kq10x, John Carruthers points out|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ritong: @d position is not that clear, i seriously doubt fred will sacrifice his @d J|pg||

nt|imp_jan: moss was pretty sure about the double diamond stopper in north|pg||
nt|mariner1: the @c pitch on the @D lead also helped tell the story|pg||
nt|mittmouse: it his partner had k 10 dbl of s he would get an extra trick this way|pg||
nt|jallerton: KJx could be the 'double stopper' though|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|c9|pg||

nt|jallerton: but North appears to be saving|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|reisig: I'm sure ..Fred dbld|pg||
nt|joest: a subsidiary question is: do forcing passes apply here?  But I agree that I'm surprised Brad doesn't just double off the sound of the auction looking at his aces and kings|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously the preemptive 3@C prevented DBL |pg||
nt|jallerton: He may be remembering a double from last night that didn't work out well, Karen suggests|pg||
