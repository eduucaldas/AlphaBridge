nt|stewball: pause pause pause pause..claim|pg||
nt|3for3: lots of minor possibilities, but with diamonds 32 all roads lead to 9 or more tricks|pg||
nt|kareno: Hm.  Meckwell in 6@d and with that convenient club king singleton... well...|pg||
nt|stewball: and the Nickell storm begins....|pg||

nt|vugraphznb: sry the thinking is by S not E|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: guessing|pg||
nt|neobas: No problem. To avoid players benefitting from operators, operaters are enjoined to enter two bids at the time - as the tray goes through|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: tell them to hurry up!! im getting sleepy... |pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: Bas always asks them, "why did you bid that?"  :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|neobas: Coffee works Yonathan :) Ask for a cup of water and dip some in your face - trick I use when operating :)|pg||

nt|mariner1: someone needed to be a little more aggressive here|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|bridge_one: the Dbl by North can be dangerous also bec give at E/W the possibility to explain better they hands|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|irwinbo: would any of you opened the north hand?|pg||
nt|mariner1: what he pitches was key here....|pg||

nt|mariner1: if you sit on your hands, especially in pairs, you will lose often, and have flat|pg||
nt|mariner1: hands|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: clasic to lose 3@s's here.. dont you think?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however this time the Dbl work well - 1 down is forced now|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|irwinbo: after watching the vanderbildt, i guess 75% of the world's best would open|pg||

nt|mariner1: well -100 is an imp for EW|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|neobas: Only in comparison with the other room|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c3|nt|neobas: Since the other pairs might have different results|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mariner1: get your system up to speed with light openers AND add controls to allow for|pg||
nt|mariner1: them.......|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think many will be in @c here..........|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|neobas: I suspect so|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c4|pc|h5|pg||

mc|8|nt|bridge_one: 3Nt would be better - 1 down the same but with the chance to make 600 !|pg||

nt|mariner1: nice 3N EW here|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 6@C are made for the dispositions of @h suit|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mariner1: very true Bas, many who open light have no controls and they get too high easily|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphznb: drums.....|pg||

nt|mariner1: and you have a @H loser too|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@C seems to have no play with good defense|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a false rever at 2@h - can be dangerous, but i agree|pg||
mb|d|an|oh no|nt|mariner1: N should pass,,|pg||
mb|r|an|oh yeah|nt|bridge_one: 4 tricks in @H, 5@c 1@s 2@d - 6@H are impossible to beat|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@C|pg||
nt|irwinbo: the two heart bid was odd to me  3c makes more sense|pg||
nt|neobas: Yup, and now XX should've been 3@C imo|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|nt|bridge_one: Rdbl is a gambling hoping in long and good @S in W|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: yes I guess you can get 4@H in to make|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mariner1: well this is an interesting spot|pg||
nt|neobas: I expect some screenpoking after this board :)|pg||
nt|irwinbo: will he take three or four tricks?|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is like a deviant to Fudd's First Law of Opposition|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4|pg||
nt|neobas: I expect four as well|pg||
nt|neobas: @CA and 3@S?|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|bridge_one: 4@H is correct with 6@C - give the chance to play one of 2 suit|pg||
