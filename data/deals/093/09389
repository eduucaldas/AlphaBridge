mb|p|nt|mariner1: hi all|pg||
mb|1D|nt|idc: and you can't get the contracts anymore either - 1@h at the other table isn't going to set our pulses racing|pg||
nt|galadriel: Transfer response then pass|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bcallaghan: Danger of getting too high in spades.|pg||
nt|keylime: 2@d Multi to start from North|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: 2@S either multi or weak majors|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|idc: at other table - North opened 1@h to show 11-15 and 4+ @s, so South passed it|pg||
mb|p|nt|bcallaghan: 4S looks like a fair contract, but not on this layout.|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: oops|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Not a good idea removing partner's penalty double with a defensive trick.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If 3@H showed his hand, he should not overrule partner's decision to defend|pg||
nt|idc: ok, my pulse is racing now, I admit that|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mariner1: EW can make 3N here if they get there|pg||
nt|keylime: good agreements needed here on where bids show stops or ask for stops|pg||

nt|idc: I'm getting a feeling that we are approaching 'last rubber of the night' territory|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: this is 16 boards from Shenyang, China|pg||

mb|1H|nt|keylime: 1@c is precision, double is a mathe takeout for majors here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|idc: but against England you need to create your own luck to an extent|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|bcallaghan: One level too high, but still gaining IMPs.|pg||

mb|2S|nt|galadriel: The boys done good...how about that?|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: I would have opened, but I count an extra half point for each ace, so I would have had a 12 count.|pg||

pc|h2|nt|mariner1: well can he make it?|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|galadriel: Ah, even after overcall?|pg||
nt|keylime: declarer will have to play desperate here, and the spade cover almost forces the finesse in spades.|pg||

pc|s3|nt|galadriel: yes, I see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I understand, but I am entirely happy with a system where you may lose the boss suit|pg||

nt|idc: Playing a short 1@c system, I used to play X as both or neither majors - but whatever you do doesn't matter, as long as you both do it|pg||
