mb|1C|an|17+ any|nt|ahollan1: EW 1@C is 17+, so Simpson upgrading|pg||
mb|d|an|Majors|nt|henryb: penalty?|pg||
mb|2C|an|5+!h|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: without DBL  EW show controls -- luckily our operator Michael Wilkinson is best in the biz for entering alerts & explanations|pg||
nt|henryb: 4@s is cold. 3N has problems, but will also make with care|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|dburn: well, 4@s may not be all that easy to reach given that South has shown majors|pg||
nt|dburn: but given that West can bid hearts "naturally", maybe East can bid spades naturally also|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|dburn: that at least is what he is trying to do, but whether West will see it that way, who knows?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: antoff-simpson tend to ignore interference and just show their hand|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: which makes psyching against them pointless|pg||
nt|dburn: an eminently sensible approach|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it's a shame EW didn't have mechanism to catch Thomson in his flight of fancy|pg||
nt|henryb: doin' what comes natcherly|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: oh my|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, they might have discussed to what extent things were forcing - but it does seem a bit odd to pass out 2NT with an 11 count facing a strong club|pg||

nt|henryb: I think S should have discouraged @h and hoped partner could work out to play @d|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: yes its results like this that cause people to bid like lunatics over strong @cs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: well the statement of EW ignore the interference and alert of 2@C conflict  -- without bid from south,  1@H=0-2 controls, 8+ HCP game force, 2@C=5 controls|pg||
nt|dburn: lunatics? South had the majors, and if push came to shove, he had an alternative strain to offer|pg||
nt|henryb: could then have had 3N making 5 and 2N down 1|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: ignore as in they can show the suit shown by the opponent|pg||

pc|d8|nt|dburn: well, they were only in 1@c doubled|pg||
nt|henryb: that, I think, may go down 1|pg||
nt|dburn: presumably if West had passed to see if he could catch them, North would have passed also - maybe the opponents could not make 1@c doubled, and even if they could, it was not game|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|Vugraphu1: Zia actually gave a moment's thought to competing over 1NT|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Zia has been studying the dummy with great concentration, still isn't ready to play|pg||
nt|3for3: no coke,pepsi|pg||
nt|kareno: But I wouldn't fade even a ten cent bet on the subject.|pg||
nt|stewball: Hammans lead is a good piece of instruction for the specs...forcing defence with long trumps|pg||
nt|chick: pepsi was playing yesterday |pg||
nt|kareno: Chick if you sniff Coca Cola you will soon look very funny... to us!!|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|chick: looks like this is going to be a loooong session|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rodwell, in CR, tried to pass out 2@s, but east balanced with 3@c, pushing them to the same contract as here|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sT|nt|stewball: hamman overrules zia|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm not sure I agree with Hamman here, though those diamonds are intimidating.|pg||
nt|stewball: well i know i dont agree with Zia|pg||
nt|kareno: I hope the spades aren't compressed by the defense.|pg||
nt|stewball: he has lousy @h spots for trump plays|pg||
nt|kareno: I prefer Hamman's club attack though.|pg||
nt|chick: when partner starts a forcing defense, trying to switch to playing trumps is kinda self-defeating|pg||
nt|stewball: its so easy from up here|pg||
nt|chick: yeah, but that's still a general statement ... should continue the defense partner started (if you trust him/her) unless you can see an obvious reason not to|pg||
