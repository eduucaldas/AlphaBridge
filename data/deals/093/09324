nt|athene: good evening everyone|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|reisig: Karen @h|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kareno: The Nickell team has its work cut out for it at this point but they are famous for comebacks.|pg||
nt|kareno: Richie @h|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|me argent: it is interesting 2 note that since @D team had seed in 3rd and 2nd quarter those r the 2 seesions platnick and @D play so they DONT lineup against Meckwell|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|dinos1: what's 3@h over X?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Not exactly the best fit|pg||
nt|athene: this is going to be tricky on a club force|pg||
pc|d7|nt|othered1: east elects not to force|pg||
nt|me argent: no way would meckwell stop below game if they  had found their @D fit|pg||
nt|dinos1: no dbl no troubl|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|nt|athene: no possible way declarer can draw trumps and retain control of the hand; he'll just play a heart off dummy and see what he can scramble, i guess|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|othered1: may now get away for -1|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to David Burn|pg||
nt|dburn: hello|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|athene: when declarer leads a stiff towards KQxx, if you duck, you lose the ace (at least temporarily) but he only gets one trick, not two|pg||

nt|othered1: And would NS have found their way out of, say, 2@CXX?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need a better suit for a redouble of 2@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not just a random 4|pg||
nt|othered1: very possible that action over 2@CX was based on @C card in west hand|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't want to give up a spade in case Meckstroth has something nice like @SQx (not at all impossible on the bidding)|pg||
nt|dinos1: and pass y W and XX by E?|pg||
nt|dinos1: by|pg||

nt|Walddk2: And we lost the closed room temporarily|pg||
nt|athene: Rodwell is working out the most likely chance to beat this|pg||
nt|athene: basically the big question is whether he has to attack clubs now, or not|pg||
nt|athene: or example declarer might have @DJ10 and be going to take a ruffing finesse through his @DQ to pitch clubs from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: for example|pg||
nt|dinos1: dcl hopes for no @c shift - then he can ruff @s then ruff @d and pitch @c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Reasonably, Moss fears that spades are 4-1 after Rod's TO double, so did not fancy his chances of setting up the suit in time|pg||
nt|dinos1: as S has 2@s he can stand @h3-1 break|pg||
nt|athene: i think Rodwell will put Meckstroth with the @HK as a lot of the time, with stiff @HJ, Meckstroth would have been bidding over 4@H at these colours|pg||
