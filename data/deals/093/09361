mb|p|nt|tullo: he would not bid himself but the defence suggested that east does not hold DK|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Ley´s have a silent game then|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|jahangir: hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|msap: 3d is d suit 8-10 points with 2 hon|pg||
nt|jahangir: 3N in OR is a good score because on this start there's a good chance of reaching 6@d|pg||
nt|werge: This 1 NT looks like maximum|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jahangir: and on a @c lead it will make too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tullo: yes super maximum|pg||
pc|s4|nt|oosmanb: not stopping now|pg||
nt|jahangir: 4@h might be rkcb-@d|pg||
nt|farrukh: a simple 3NT here|pg||
pc|s9|nt|tullo: maybe he is trying to balnce his over bid on the previous with an underbid here|pg||
nt|werge: Only 8 sure tricks on a @h-lead - but the 9th is just around the corner|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|msap: 4d is asking for control in d suit|pg||
nt|msap: 4nt shows second round|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 7@H lead might beat 5@D even? @d 10 promo if decl finesses which he should|pg||
nt|jahangir: i guess i was wrong...been there before:)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @C only missing cue it seems, south might lead @C?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jahangir: i think @c lead will be the lead of choice of many experts|pg||
nt|oosmanb: that will cost|pg||
nt|oosmanb: double swing|pg||
nt|jahangir: a swong for sure, regardless of how its played|pg||
nt|jahangir: swing|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @S cue also missing, so i don't know if @c lead safest|pg||
nt|ehsana: slam on now|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|nt|farrukh: now +1|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|jahangir: true, but against small slams aggression is usually required...unless the auction suggests being passive|pg||
nt|oosmanb: that lead cost 22 imps, good start for candyland|pg||
nt|ehsana: hand plays better without trump finesse|pg||
nt|jahangir: it does|pg||
nt|msap: this hand makes on any lead|pg||
nt|msap: as dec after eliminating majors and ruffing a h in hand beg can end playjawad|pg||
nt|oosmanb: do you mean at the current position or 6@D?|pg||

pc|d9|pc|h3|pc|d4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: declarer thinking and thinking|pg||
nt|oosmanb: if he finesses @D a @d back beats this still?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h7|nt|ehsana: Dec definitely has a problem of disposing hearts, ruffing clubs|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jahangir: needs trumps 3-2 and @s no worse than 5-2|pg||

nt|yo_yo: our Cansino?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and just some hand you know you have to bid the nt first,  others you want to pard to do it |pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: I believe he's English, yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2suiter?|pg||
nt|hedyg: alert?|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: except they dont get to bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: invite sequence |pg||
nt|yo_yo: is this puppet stayman?|pg||
nt|timb: I'm pleased that they will go to Sao Paolo|pg||
mb|2N|nt|othered1: 3N, played at the other table, has a risk of going down when 6@S makes.  But the 2@C response, assuming it's natural, may minimize the likelihood of @C lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Peggy Bayer: ENG 175 (maximum!) - SCOT 143 - WAL 102 - NI 49 - IRE 44|pg||
nt|bgn: but now W preempted NS out of going down in 3@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: or not |pg||
nt|sybarra2: it is sad but likely a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|wojela: i Jaroslaw Wachnowski http://www.msc.com.pl/cezar/?mycl=1&p=21&r=02166|pg||
nt|timb: (EW that is)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|othered1: I hate the 3N bid, wonder if 2N would have been nonforcing or would have shown many extras, part of a hateful fast arrival approach to this auction?|pg||
nt|wojela: http://pzbs.pl/wyniki/2009/krajowe/gpp/02pila/gp.html wyniki na bie¿¹co|pg||
mb|p|nt|bgn: Usually not so valuable to push when you have defence to other major|pg||
nt|hedyg: not sure why she did that since N was a passed hand|pg||
nt|chick: apparently not|pg||
nt|santyclz: Some type of stayman starting with a p.  Puppet of psychic.|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: will probably lose 2 spades, hope they dont lose 2 clubs also|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: system card says "other: 5 card enquiry"|pg||
nt|chick: E can see 6 tricks... where to find the other 3?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bgn: North is a demon reopener, so from West's viewpoint quite possible for N to double if West passes 2@S, and South to compete (not on this hand though)|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugrapha4: east puts her hand down to tank|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: not a nice choice - prevent declarer losing 2 clubs, give her diamond finesse..|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, that double was unlikely to be duplicated.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: not at all obvious for a passed hand to ask pd to bid on the 3 level|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: or r/d|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bgn: Quite true. She would only do it if short in @S|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|nt|dburn: I don't imagine 2NT would have been forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes in case pd's pass was a trap pass|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dburn: so that South could not really do other than bid 3NT - North did not have to pass it, of course, but one can see why he might|pg||
nt|othered1: Then maybe 2N forcing over 1@S?  Seems a better description than starting off with a semi-psych.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|santyclz: Just has to pitch a @c from dmy on the 1st round of @ss and hold the ace for the 3rd round.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c7|pc|d7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|dburn: 2NT might show a spade raise directly over 1@s|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chick: that might be J2N|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chick: that's a good move ... the contract is hopeless, so go for ONLY -1|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h4|pg||

nt|santyclz: I guess the theory is if they let you do it, they deserve the result.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chick: now if the dummy was really thinking fast, she could have mixed a small club in the the spades and laid them on the table that way :)|pg||

nt|tullo: at this vulnerability sarfraz would pass with a yarboro|pg||

nt|othered1: OK, then NS *can* choose to tie themselves in knots with  their NT bidding.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here is a good example hand. What you do not double a weak NT with. Too weak, no attractive lead|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: po tej sesji bedzie przerwa obiadowa|pg||
nt|hedyg: i will not ask why..|pg||
nt|bgn: South splintered in @S there too so I guess East took North's NT bid too seriously|pg||
nt|chick: just kidding, of course  ....  don't send me no-no's kibs :)|pg||
nt|chick: this 4@S is a little kinder|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|hedyg: might be so|pg||
nt|chick: S has a problem, 16 HCP, no suit, can't double without hearts ... maybe 1N on an aggressive day|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugrapha4: only 2s? maybe her partner is in the habit of making 4 card overcalls|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: pass?|pg||
nt|chick: I'd bid 1@H with W hand as well|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Mind you, the defence was not world class, but still|pg||
nt|othered1: Was west's opening a weak NT at the other table or an upgrade to strong?  That's quite a hand with a good 5-card major to open as a weak NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was a weak NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh dear they made 4@S on the hand I said normal human beings wouldnt|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well i suppose they were given it|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: i guess after 1d 2d the auction is probably going to stop |pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphpl2: para jassem49,25%|pg||
nt|bgn: wow - I'm surprised West is allowed to pass out 1NT after a redouble!|pg||
nt|chick: nope, took an immediate heart finesse the right way|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: is 3 @D a spade bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: no idea, but S should definitely be showing a preference for spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: maybe she should have bid 1@s and not XX, has no bid now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no  defenders led @H for them|pg||
nt|chick: oops, you are right :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes, n made a very good shift at trick 3 in this room.|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: why they didnt compete wth their at least 9 cd fit i dont know|pg||
pc|hK|nt|linda28: 4@S is a good spot|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|chick: maybe it was a  'you be declarer',  'no, you do it'  :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sybarra: did W  need to bid 3 @D|pg||
nt|santyclz: Happy to see e didn't commit a weak nt on this hand.|pg||
nt|linda28: all over now for Havas - lead has completely blown out with another swing on bd 32|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: It has become an obsessions for some. When opps open a weak NT, *you* feel you are being robbed because you have a 13 count|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: would you plssssssssssss play @H now pd?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|chick: for maximum tricks, she needs to ruff 4 minor suit cards before drawing trump|pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: I'll guess this will make on the nose|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you double for penalties, you must be stronger than this if balanced|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|timb: I admit I would have bid 2@S on the North hand and the same over 1@S on the South hand |pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|santyclz: If s exits in trump, n must duck.|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: south is tanking|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: has pulled d3 to the side of her hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont mind a 1NT opener on this actually|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bgn: the @H certainly makes partner happier than anything else :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugrapha4: maybe west felt really pessimistic but east knew for sure|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dburn: on the other hand, of course, if both North and South have balanced 13 counts and no one doubles, they will indeed have been robbed|pg||
nt|sybarra: knows she is pickling pard with trump lead|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bgn: but still only 1 off I think|pg||
nt|yo_yo: tells partner  what you have and is preemptive at the same time vs vul opps|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Soputh can hardly have a 13 count for her initial pass|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|othered1: but south may have a bit of leeway to double lighter than in the direct position|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: They have not stolen anything from you, so keep a low profile|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|santyclz: N figures (rightly) they have no tricks left out of trump so hopes to develope a 2nd trump trick by giving ruff sluffs.|pg||

nt|oosmanb: 4@s now reachable|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|jahangir: normal lead and i think nothing much to the play either...declarer will likely not be in a position to take 2 @c finesses so it'll make 5|pg||

nt|oosmanb: doesnt promise anything outside I believe|pg||
nt|tullo: it does show cards yes|pg||

nt|yo_yo: yes but probably wont guess them|pg||
nt|kareno: From within reach, this match has escalated to, as you say, a blowout.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bgn: but may stop lower?|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 2@s and all pass?|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5@d is a good pressure bid by Berman|pg||
nt|poohbear: Forces the opps to make a 5 lvl decision|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Don't know, but I would get in|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugrapha4: sorry lost auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: might get a @H away though |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: making 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: a 7 card suit should be repeatable|pg||
nt|bgn: all very reasonable, but unhappy result|pg||
mb|p|nt|the saint: The party tonight will go on a while too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5-5, all high cards in your suits and NV v V|pg||
nt|othered1: So would I, especially if I had a 2-suited bid available|pg||
nt|bgn: West might evern have raised @H rather than rebid @S?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|chick: and I|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is a @H lead |pg||
nt|santyclz: Depends on the defense.  If n shows up with ak a before the @ss are played, should get it right.|pg||
nt|sybarra: so might have to guess the @H's|pg||
nt|kareno: Interesting on 32, Sue Lusk made an offside double.  |pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: guess the @S I mean|pg||
nt|poohbear: Fuller goes low. bidding a slam is possible as all she needs is AKxxx in @hs to make it|pg||
pc|hK|nt|othered1: That looks pretty conservative, vulnerable, but it may win imps here|pg||
nt|dburn: good view by North, that - I was thinking he might bid game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is makeable with all cards in view, but it's much more difficult at the table|pg||
nt|hedyg: not like her @s are that good|pg||
nt|hedyg: A10 surely worth xxx|pg||
nt|poohbear: Possibly as little as AJxxxx|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|poohbear: So Berman accomplishes her mission|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|othered1: especially with east remaining silent|pg||
nt|bgn: In other room on Bd 2, EW had an inelegant auction to 4@S on 4-3 fit|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|chick: I suspect it was 1N 2@D 2@H 4@H :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: no, 2nt open|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h5|nt|bgn: South, Rena Kaplan, had no trouble finding a double with @SKQ108 and @HA :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: the contract got what it deserved|pg||
nt|santyclz: N must have a @c card since s didn't lead one.|pg||
nt|sybarra: play @S from the top |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c3|nt|hedyg: no need to raise to 2@s on xxx with a perfectly good 2@d rebid|pg||
pc|h6|nt|othered1: unblocking 9 might have been wiser|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hedyg: Niek is she thinking really?|pg||
nt|mwigor: for what its worth i like the 2@s raise|pg||
nt|bgn: Oh Hedy, now you've embarrassed me. I would have raised to 2@S, but think West should bid 2NT, not 4@S. Then we can still get to 3@D|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: yes|pg||
nt|mwigor: but dont like the jump to 4@s with a 4441 and on partners opened suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: down now |pg||
pc|c5|pc|s2|nt|hedyg: why bid 2@s Bruce? 2@d is a natural bid|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|vugrapha4: a two suiter|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bgn: because I'm not strong enough to bid 2@S if partner bids 2@H over my 2@D bid. For me that shows extra|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jahangir: 1 or 3 would probably the mainsteam choice in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: sensible 3D here|pg||
nt|tullo: 13 back to candyland if he scores his overtrick|pg||
nt|jahangir: i guess N doesnt...but its very reasonable to pass that trickless 12 count|pg||
nt|werge: - and OK, 1 @H in Open might be ONE of the resans to bid the slam |pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|tullo: even without a pass mr blackwood taught us how to check the aces|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|farrukh: but basic problem is why did south bid 5@d when North showed 0-3 keycards?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|werge: I pass even with 13 bad points - but this North hand has intermediates in @H and no rebid-problem = 1 @H-opening|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|h3|nt|oosmanb: what was 3@S over 2NT?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|sK|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d6|mc|11|nt|farrukh: maybe natural after game force|pg||
nt|oosmanb: was trying to find a 44 @s fit ?|pg||
nt|werge: To explain the bidding in Open, we might use 30-40 minutes...|pg||
nt|jahangir: yes, but i think those are minor plusses...this hand has 1/2 defensive tricks and not enough distribution for safety if partner gets aggressive during the auction|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: N getting some water|pg||
nt|sybarra: puppet auction coming up?|pg||
nt|poohbear: hand is good cause it has some 10s and a void and spades|pg||
mb|2D|nt|chick: it wasn't the club lead that did it, it was not playing the spades right|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|hedyg: ohhhhhhh well then she must bid 2@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry meant transfer  etc  |pg||
nt|poohbear: This time though she moght be in danger of missing a game. A few well placed @c values and an ace might make 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: As it is she did well|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: likely @C lead but then what?|pg||
nt|bgn: (Sorry - we're talking about the auction in the other room ... I forgot!  They are BOTH Victorian, so I can almost guarantee 2@D would be forcing!)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: rofl|pg||
nt|chick: now S will wish she'd bid hers, so pard would know what to lead|pg||
nt|poohbear: opps can make game|pg||
mb|4N|nt|hedyg: in that case maybe she should have opened 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: This has the potential to be another medium swing to Ireland, as N. Ireland's chances to win the event are slipping away.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: again no skip with 4 of partner's suit|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|santyclz: 4@c or 4@d over 3@h?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Fuller is under pressure to bid when she is short in @h but dbl by her is not necessarily Take out|pg||

mb|6D|nt|yo_yo: that would be super max with me, Joe|pg||

nt|werge: Only 11, I thinkl|pg||
nt|jahangir: even then i might consider bidding:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|tullo: no he didnt|pg||
nt|tullo: that would put opp under pressure|pg||
nt|jahangir: i think he will plan to try to drop the @sQ and if that fails, fall back on H hook|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Can just play top trumps, and top @h throwing @c regardless|pg||
nt|tullo: 3cl by Masood would have made life difficult for opp|pg||
nt|tullo: but he missed it|pg||
nt|ehsana: no pressures he has 10 tricks..11th a bonus|pg||
nt|jahangir: that wont work on @c lead if the trump Q does not fall|pg||
nt|tullo: and then didnt have enough courage to muster that bid|pg||
nt|ehsana: after trumps has the luxury of a ruffing finesse :)|pg||
nt|jahangir: w/ the @HAK onside 5@c wud've been good|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I see what happened in closed room, defence helped alot|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|oosmanb: west played @h thrice|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|werge: What shall all this bidding after 1 NT? Help opponents|pg||
nt|tullo: club lead makes things intersting|pg||
pc|c9|nt|farrukh: maybe @d lead |pg||
nt|oosmanb: will he play on @S or @D|pg||
nt|tullo: i thinkj club would be led|pg||
nt|farrukh: well after the bidding @d lead shd be best as south is known to hold 2 maximum|pg||
nt|werge: @S-lead is 4th choice|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jahangir: and if he plays @s first will make 5|pg||
nt|tullo: heheheheehheheheheh|pg||

nt|sybarra: I think this is last bd of this set |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: quick break now|pg||
nt|kareno: That certainly can be another swing to Havas.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: thx to our terrific operator Niek,  |pg||
nt|poohbear: weak NT. should land them in 2@h but Havas might balance. ( I would) 2NT for the minors|pg||
nt|timb: Still, the boards are few and the imps to find are many :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: but there's till bd 24 to score up|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: still|pg||
nt|timb: A classic weak 2|pg||
nt|timb: ?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: she almost passed|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: 6@C was a little ambitious|pg||
nt|chick: tough bid for S, if pard has clubs is a big hand, if not he has 3 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: and of course to my co commentators  Hedy (who went to bed) and Bruce is is almost ready for 2nd cup of coffee|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: may end up in 3NT here, though|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|sybarra: I am blasting into 3 nt with 4333 |pg||
nt|poohbear: Berman might bid direct to show the majors but with a weak NT preferable to have more values when bidding direct|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: at least one should have better suits|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 3C not alerted|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: well it has been by North now|pg||
nt|linda28: they are prob playing Lebensohl so 3C shows values|pg||
nt|kareno: I wondered if it is Lebensohl.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: I dont need to give the opps any info|pg||
nt|chick: especially with an honor in every suit|pg||
nt|poohbear: I hate letting them play at the 2 lvl like that|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: kantar advises not to stayman on 4333  but maybe puppet different|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dburn: and that won't play terribly well either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How do you get to 5@C with accuracy?|pg||
nt|dburn: good decision by West not to raise the pre-empt with 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: David must have the recipe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The trouble is that even 5@C won't make on a spade lead|pg||
nt|petergill: Bidding systems of the pairs are at http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2009/Systems_Womens.html|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: an maybe it was puppet but still |pg||
nt|santyclz: I handle that dilemma by refusing to play puppet.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: So how do you stay out of game?|pg||
nt|dburn: not at all obvious to get to 5@c - I confess, I would have bid the same way as North-South here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well i dont really understand it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I play puppet over 2 nt,  but not 1 nt|pg||
nt|yo_yo: me too|pg||
nt|sybarra: there are good reasons over 2 nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: but have never been convinced over 1 nt|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: on their system card under stayman says, "other: 5 card enquiry"|pg||
nt|yo_yo: several of our young stars refuse to play puppet|pg||
nt|kareno: Well done.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: thx also to the ABF and to Nick Fahrer for bringing this terrific tourney to BBO |pg||
nt|chick: after all, she has the A of her pard's second suit|pg||
nt|kareno: She can duck once to assure if west had a five-card suit it will be locked out.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: Open in 6@H here,,,, did not score in movie|pg||
pc|h5|nt|santyclz: I play 2nt can't contain a 5+card suit.  With the point count and a suit I open 2@d multi.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|kareno: She will have to brave the diamond suit.|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: she just asked abou their weak 2 style|pg||
nt|kareno: No, she actually has nine without diamonds.|pg||
nt|kareno: No I'm wrong - she needs a diamond.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|poohbear: Declarer has 3 off suit tricks . If she can take 5 trumps in hand that would be 8|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What happened here??|pg||
nt|kareno: Let's find out right now, she says, and her ten of hearts is protected.|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: in 3NT next door so no swing on this one|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: and of course thx to our specs for all the the great comments |pg||
nt|yo_yo: interesting that the Aussies play womens teams at the same time as the open teams|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: 3 not in category of "heavy lifting"|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is it?|pg||
nt|chick: a little wimpy I think|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They blocked the spades?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: which means the women cant enter both|pg||
nt|sybarra: well my 1 nts and 3 nts can contain 5 cd majors but I am NEVER  5422 |pg||
nt|santyclz: That was made illegal in the acbl circa 1980.|pg||
nt|chick: and Ax in a side suit is often better than Axx|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dburn: nothing very much|pg||
nt|sybarra: read again NEVER|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what do you mean illegal?|pg||
nt|santyclz: There was a lawsuit.|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: the womens trials arent held at the same time as open only the finals are the same time|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|othered1: Not unblocking is silly at best, even if east retains an entry here|pg||
nt|poohbear: So I would be looking to try and score baby trumps with ruffs|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|dburn: they did indeed block the spades, but they can survive that with East having @dA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, declarer could have knocked out @DA and make it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No they can't|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: South had to knock out East's entry, not West's|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|kareno: Safe overtrick.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|dburn: sure they can - East wins the third round of diamonds, on which West pitches @sK|pg||
nt|sybarra: might have wanted to duck first sp all around?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|santyclz: It was ruled descrimination.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c8|nt|petergill: well, if your style is to avoid overcalling 2@C on that West hand (Dbl or Pass are OK, 2@C is absurd), then we might see you in the Playoff. |pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: Declarer does not play a 3rd round of diamonds!|pg||
nt|othered1: but south probably thought east had @SKQJ, so took the play available (stiff @CK)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then what?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|petergill: meant to be private |pg||
pc|c7|pc|h9|nt|chick: no ruff?|pg||
nt|sybarra: getting rid of @S dummy next |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|sybarra: something not right |pg||
nt|chick: two boards to go in this set|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kareno: No squeeze, though.  West must hold three spades to protect against an endplay of east.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yo_yo: discrimination to not to be able to enter both?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: in UK we get women entering both|pg||
nt|chick: I'd be happy if the women's events were eliminated altogether ... there is nothing about bridge that is gender-dependent|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in that case we wouldnt see many women playing |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I must say on acbl, I would skip the "stacks" |pg||
nt|chick: to me, it's an insult to think that women require their own event so they don't have to compete against men|pg||
nt|yo_yo: at club level men and women are about equal in ability|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: would be a shame if you never got to play overseas cause all the top players were guys|pg||
nt|yo_yo: at top level  the women fall away|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|d2|nt|chick: then learn bridge well enough to compete at that level|pg||
nt|santyclz: Tell that to Rixi Marcus.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a fact|pg||
nt|poohbear: This line worked fine since there was no spade ruff and the ace was onside|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|sybarra: but in the "old days"  we had men and women's pairs on friday afternoon, then mixed on fridays nights.  then open's then teams|pg||
nt|yo_yo: however much we women hate to admit it|pg||
nt|kareno: East must pitch the queen now.  |pg||
pc|s8|nt|petergill: Someone told me privately that next year they plan to be in the Playoff, and that was my response.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h3|pc|sJ|pg||
mc|11|nt|kareno: She can be endplayed and she is.  Tired play to keep the queen of spades.|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Declarer takes two rounds of diamonds because East must duck; then he knocks out @CK. How do you defend from there, David?|pg||

nt|poohbear: Partial battle here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|yo_yo: exactement|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: it aint Rio|pg||
mb|3N|nt|othered1: as things worked out, the non-unblock of the @S K was merely a Grosvenor (until west didn't return @D)|pg||
nt|chick: That's not the fault of gender, it's the fault of them not learning to play well enough to win|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H =I have 4 @S|pg||
nt|poohbear: West should compete here|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: I would have beaten it, if you had done what you said you would do and knocked out the ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|bgn: 2@S no doubt shows @C, 2NT shows likes @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: and E just wanted out of Dodge  |pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: for anyone in the audience who doesn't know puppet .. 3@D shows at least one 4 card major, no 5.  3@H shows 4 spades but not 4 hearts.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: no 9 cd fit tho|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|bgn: 3NT actually has some play|pg||
nt|chick: the "opposite major" bid keeps the strong hand as declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: works well over 2 nt, if you open 2 nt's wthat include a possible 5 card major |pg||
nt|sybarra: and right sides the 4 card major |pg||
nt|poohbear: life is tuff sometimes:)|pg||

nt|tullo: can make  on d lead though|pg||
nt|tullo: 11 on D lead|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jahangir: 4@h bid and made is the normal contract here|pg||
nt|tullo: if it was stadium game Hamid would bid 6club|pg||
nt|jahangir: difficult for NS to get together in @s since N does not have a D fit or enough values|pg||
nt|tullo: but this is finals|pg||
nt|tullo: can he gamble|pg||
mb|p|nt|tullo: with team already in arrears|pg||

nt|farrukh: Hi Tehsin and all other watching|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jahangir: would mazhar have bid 2@s in the stadium here tullo?|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|tullo: wow he got excited |pg||
pc|s5|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|werge: I think, that Spouth´s @d-overbid was not the strength, which North is taking it for|pg||
nt|tullo: 3D was limit or better with H fit|pg||
nt|farrukh: well his hand warrents one more bid after 3@d bid|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|dQ|nt|farrukh: yes and if Puri had bid 3NT after 3@s, North would never get excited|pg||
nt|tullo: so 4H suggested that he has nothing to say|pg||
nt|tullo: specialy his inabilty to cue clubs|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|farrukh: 3NT would have described the hand better than 4@h maybe|pg||

nt|werge: 3 NT directly is not stupid either!|pg||
nt|tullo: now declarer is home|pg||
nt|tullo: that was his only chance|pg||
nt|farrukh: yes got lucky |pg||
nt|tullo: but declarer may go for Dk 3RD dropping |pg||
nt|werge: How could it be wrong for East to polay the @S 7...?|pg||
nt|tullo: setting his DQ|pg||
nt|werge: play|pg||
nt|tullo: or the H9|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tullo: he misguessed|pg||

nt|santyclz: Sorry, 2 imps.|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: last bd for this set |pg||
nt|poohbear: South palyed 3@d in the other room. Looks like not a big deal as EW can make 2@s possibly 3|pg||

mb|3C|mb|3S|nt|othered1: transfer response of some type?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and of course thx to my commentators Kath, Joe and Cornelia |pg||
mb|4C|nt|sybarra: close to making 4 @H here|pg||
nt|sybarra: or might in fact make |pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks like a @d or nt partscore.|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3-2 break makes it easy|pg||
nt|timb: Ughh! 3@C Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: Undo please|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South passed over 4NT|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@S?  even in a limited opening system, stiff honor and acelessness make that ultra aggressive|pg||
nt|athene: north knows his partner has an ace on the bidding, so can lead the @HA and beat 5@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|chick: great job Erin :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Erin,  |pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to my co commentator Cornelia...always nice to share views.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl2: http://pzbs.pl/wyniki/2009/krajowe/gpp/02pila/gp.html|pg||
nt|poohbear: She has to be concerned about a red suit return. She should duck|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: the hands werent very exciting |pg||
nt|sybarra: and to the ABF,  and Nick Farher for bringing this terrific tourney to BBO |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Oh well, they really are tired|pg||
nt|dburn: might make an overtrick or so, in truth|pg||
nt|sybarra: actually as pointed out by spec,  how do you NOT make it |pg||
nt|sybarra: *Fahrer |pg||
pc|c4|nt|bgn: Interesting auction in other room - looks like they checked back to find 5-3 @H fit, then played 3NT anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: and how did they not make that?|pg||
nt|bgn: can make 3NT also - but have choice of lines. Can play for @D 4-4 or take @S finesse|pg||
nt|olson: they did not finesse the spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to ABF and to Nick Fahrer,  for bringing this terrific tourney to BBO  |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: there's a state of the match double|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: 5@C taken as three keycards|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: no bidding in the other room |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry Nick,  will get your name sorted out some day |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe they were convinced that diamonds were 4-4, so they played on clubs and not spades|pg||
nt|timb: A Flat board?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: Why didnt they double 6@c I am asked. Because South did not bid 6@C, West did|pg||
nt|athene: well north, with an ace in his hand, knows a wheel fell off|pg||
nt|athene: since east is making grand slam tries|pg||
nt|athene: so i think he can deduce it was a misunderstanding over the ambiguous 5@C RKCB bid|pg||
nt|athene: and double|pg||
nt|santyclz: Anyone for ducking the 1st @d?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to our spec,  the greatest audience in the world for keeping us straight with your comments  (and we like you humor also)|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu all next set|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|d6|nt|poohbear: Sorry she SHOULDNT duck a red suit return|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: But isn't it normal to bid 5@S after the 0 or 3 response? Partner passes with 0 and raises with 3|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe this is just another RKC problem (of which there are many, even at higher levels than this)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: throw them in and hope they give me a club trick?|pg||
nt|santyclz: And thanks to Shirley.|pg||
nt|timb: Should make now|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|sybarra: carding showed this route  |pg||
pc|c5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|olson: declarer won the first diamond in the other room,  if ducked  EW might reveal hoiw the suit is splitting |pg||
nt|timb: Cash @SQ, guess which red suit to cash then cash the other one.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bgn: so a swing to Havas will make the match close again at the end of the set|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chick: yep, good defense|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: swap the 6  and 7 of spades this may go down|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d7|pg||
nt|sybarra: i.e. the ace of @H|pg||
nt|poohbear: as that might allow the opps to shift to the other red suit before the @c Ace is gone|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|henryb: I think there was confusion. West thought he was playing 1430 and showed 1. East decided 1 was impossible and that partner was playing 0314 and that it had to be 3|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: I think they play 1430 and 5@C showed 1 or 4|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|othered1: it coiuldn't have been 4 from east's perspective|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chick: or maybe he was just swinging|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sybarra: ! |pg||
pc|hK|nt|poohbear: possibly losing 5 red tricks and 2 black tricks|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: and a close set as we go into next round|pg||
pc|hT|nt|yo_yo: ah i see bourke has caught up!|pg||
nt|poohbear: ( remember that counting losers theme I was talking about:)))|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|nt|sybarra: and making 6! |pg||
nt|dburn: even so, to play for @sK onside is in theory a better chance than playing for 4-4 diamonds, but...|pg||
pc|c9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry we missed slam pard,  LOL|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: England v Wales, sorry|pg||
nt|shevek: true|pg||
nt|kareno: That lead could work out very well if south switches to trumps at once.|pg||
nt|linda28: it has to be Jack H for 3 off|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kareno: Yes, that's right, but they must also find their club suit.  I don't like the club switch here.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sybarra: making 7n |pg||
nt|sybarra: 7 @C I mean |pg||
nt|chick: it's an easy one to miss at the table though :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|the saint: So having bought the hand through West's inaction over the opening, Ireland are now getting overboard|pg||
nt|othered1: On the NS cards alone, 4@H can make, but if you're going to open south's hand, maybe 3@S is a bit much on north's.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hedyg: yes just ruff 1 @H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dburn: this can go down two, but the defence is not that easy, and down one is perhaps a more likely outcome|pg||
nt|the saint: Well, this is going off on a club ruff. But there is also a diamond trick to be had|pg||
nt|sybarra: is missing because q of @C on side |pg||
nt|sybarra: not a slam I want to be in |pg||
nt|chick: slam?|pg||
nt|sybarra: thought that was point of splinter|pg||
nt|sybarra: so I just bid 4 @H |pg||
pc|d5|nt|chick: no way to avoid 2 clubs, 1 spade and at least one trump loser|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|chick: 2 schools of thought ... some say splinter is for finding distributional slams, others say that 2/1 is better for slam hands, and splinters are for limit-min game hands|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dburn: it might have been better had he misread the lead and shifted to a diaond|pg||
pc|c8|nt|othered1: Might a higher @S from west have tipped east to the @D shift?|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes at trick 2.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dburn: since now, the defenders cannot collect their diamond trick|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|timb: I'm surprised that Berman didn;t bid 2NT. On a non-spade lead you make lots of tricks in 3NT|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: Eng 127 - NI 117 - Scot 108 - Ire 87 - Wal 97|pg||
nt|othered1: remember, east has little information about south's hand from the auction|pg||

pc|h3|nt|chick: I agree with you, Shirley ... this hand doesn't qualify for either method :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|linda28: but 3D would have at least given them a chance to go +|pg||
nt|kareno: Pass would have also had they gotten the defense right.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra2: and others would just bid 1 nt - 3 nt|pg||

mb|4S|nt|chick: the N hand is excellent when partner has a suit ... any suit, but not great for NT|pg||

nt|santyclz: For declarer, yes.|pg||
nt|kareno: That two of hearts after raising could seduce west into continuing the suit.  I would lead the top heart.|pg||

mb|1D|nt|yo_yo: not morning yet|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: E coming in?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 15 min|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: N is too weak to pass|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: probably n/s will compete to 3c over 2h and make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like e/w can make 4@h|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: transfer to @D no doubt |pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|chick: N should stay silent and hope they find 3N|pg||
nt|chick: good 3N ... can they manage to stay out of slam?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: or maybe they will be in 3h -1 when n/s can make 4c .. hard to compete to the 4 level vul|pg||
nt|timb: It does indeed - the NS cards are quite friendly|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: And if n/s get too optimistic in spades, west has an answer :)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: nah weak NT    wont strech |pg||
mb|4H|nt|santyclz: On another day 4@s might make.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i always skip if I have 4 card support, dont you?|pg||
nt|chick: only with a max|pg||
nt|yo_yo: max and 4?|pg||
nt|chick: yes|pg||
nt|chick: might be possible to make 6@D|pg||
nt|sybarra2: the stiff K of @S in N will make it difficult |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: i wonder what the 3h bid was supposed to achieve|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i like that 2NT if it's 2 places to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: that double looked like penalty to me|pg||
nt|sybarra: W really didnt want her pard to bid |pg||
nt|santyclz: Guessing 2nt is 2 places to play.  Not what n has in mind.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: did N really bid 2 @D,  is that conventional?|pg||
mb|d|nt|timb: Many years ago Ron Cook held @DAKQ10 and he doubled 6@D in a constructive auction; that was the final contract and he made all of his trumps as he was over @DJ when his opponents ...|pg||
nt|timb: had a 4-4 fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: probably GF checkback|pg||
nt|sybarra2: not so sure it is the hand for that is it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: if you trust your partner to have 4 hearts for that X, then I'd definitely bid 3@H|pg||
nt|santyclz: N almost has 4.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now they reach their lovely... 4/4 @H fit|pg||
nt|chick: E may not be finished yet, either|pg||
nt|chick: interesting that the 7 card diamond fit is better than the 8 card club fit|pg||
nt|sybarra2: maybe only game force they had|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: a bit late for 3s|pg||
nt|chick: agree|pg||
pc|dA|nt|timb: The double was for the lead agains 6@H|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|sybarra: this might get X's|pg||
nt|hedyg: if you wanted to play in @H why didnt you bid them over 2NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: *X'd |pg||
nt|chick: but E is the one who should have bid it|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: e doesnt know theres a 9 cd fit|pg||
nt|chick: good point|pg||
nt|sybarra2: grab the 10 tricks and get out of dodge|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|kareno: Too funny.|pg||
nt|kareno: North doubled why?  Didn't like the sound of the auction?  State of the match?|pg||
nt|linda28: sounds like state of the match|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, it will be moving more in the same direction after this hand, I predict.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yo_yo: we dont agree on this one cornelia, I like to skip with the West hand|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d9|nt|santyclz: Double-dmy can make 4 I think.|pg||
nt|chick: sometimes I forget they can't see as much as we can :)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|timb: Probably the latter. Diana Smart should have a few nervous moments befor scoring +590|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chick: 6@D can be made by ruffing a spade, drawing trump and taking the heart finesse to dump a club|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|hedyg: a good time to play @H|pg||
nt|santyclz: Find the @h q for a @d pitch.|pg||

nt|sybarra2: a lot of bds to play  |pg||

nt|sybarra2: no|pg||
nt|timb: I prefer 4@H or 2@S (cue raise) to 3@H|pg||
nt|kareno: This is IMPs - I would just bid 4@h with the east hand.  |pg||
mb|d|nt|bgn: ns headed too high now, unless defence slips|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|timb: One of Australia's all time great players (Ian McCance) points out that EW play Acol circa 1960 :)|pg||
nt|linda28: I think EW may be playing only 4 card majors so raising to 4@H not so easy|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: well this will be interesting....|pg||
nt|hedyg: that happens frequently when you open hands like this|pg||
nt|bgn: If you were West, would you double 3@S for lead against 3NT?|pg||
nt|chick: playing puppet, I would.    without puppet, I'd open 1@H|pg||
nt|sybarra2: you probably have to break my arm to open 1 or 2 nt on 5422 pattern unless my 2-2 are ak, aq|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: no  |pg||
nt|hedyg: with what? i want a @H lead!|pg||

nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and that particular west hand I am not afraid to reverse|pg||

pc|h5|pc|c3|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
