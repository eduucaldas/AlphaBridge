nt|athene: aggressive 2@H on a balanced hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: and South chose to show her hearts and hope for the best, rather than leave partner to rot in spades|pg||

nt|lestergold: east going cautiously and haas done well as 4s is ulikley to make without defensive error|pg||
nt|athene: an immediate 2@S response to 1@C would be weak|pg||
nt|athene: so 1@S then 2@S is always constructive|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|nt|mayors: so the 2@s rebid is fairly constructive and helps them stay low|pg||
nt|athene: but even so it's a cautious evaluation with that east hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|athene: 2@S or not? very different when they are hundreds|pg||
mb|p|nt|mayors: The aggressive weak 2 again|pg||
nt|athene: i guess that's not the right attitude to adopt - don't think how much it will cost if you go down; think how much you score if you make ten :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well horrible vulnerable bid but hwere they have easy 4s in any case|pg||
nt|athene: 6@S is a fair spot|pg||
nt|athene: round about one of two finesses (@S and @D)|pg||
nt|mayors: slam is good here needs, one of diamonds or spades to play for no loser|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes 6s appears to be almost 75%|pg||
nt|lestergold: welol south has a clearcut slam going hand bound to try|pg||
nt|athene: it will be very hard for Reynolds to find out about the critical meshing honours which make slam good|pg||
nt|athene: when he finds they are off @SK it's not going to look hopeful|pg||
nt|athene: but @HQ and @DJ10 are what the hand is all about|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|lestergold: well south hand is so powerful in all departments that i think it almost justifies a drive to slam without identifying particular details|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|athene: yes, facing a sane weak-2|pg||
nt|lestergold: adn this isnot a sane weak 2 and its still a good slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6D|nt|mayors: yes but he's probably expecting this sort of hand|pg||
nt|athene: if 2@S promises specifically 5-card suit then the north hand maybe isn't a minimum|pg||
nt|lestergold: presumably 3d asked and 3h said filthy minimum in all ways?|pg||
nt|athene: the point is north doesn't know how great the @DJ10 and @HQ are|pg||

nt|lestergold: e/w probably about to bid another unmakeable game|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: and you can't afford to cash too many rounds of clubs to get a count as that would establish club tricks for north|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|timb: Compared to a takeout double of 1@D, the 2@C overcall misdescribes the West Hand|pg||
nt|shevek: awkward for North since 1NT shows values & 2C might beget 2NT |pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mayors: 3@d probably a non forcing game try; shows only 4 @s|pg||
nt|lestergold: unlucky hand duplication and unfavourable layout|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: mind u west's try is optimistic east's acceptance is of course perfectly correct|pg||
nt|athene: playing a weak NT, the theory is, that opener's 2@S bid here shows a good hand|pg||
nt|athene: because he either has a strong NT or an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|mayors: playing weak NT he pretty much has to make a try if partner could have 15/16 bal|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: well, it's perfectly normal to reach game with 25 high and a 4-4 major fit|pg||
nt|lestergold: illusion here apparent gift on the lead but still the same club loser ultimately|pg||
nt|lestergold: no way to avoid loss of a club a heart and 2 spads|pg||
nt|athene: the club lead is flirting with disaster (declarer could rise and threaten to pitch club on diamond)|pg||
nt|athene: but south has just too many trump entries|pg||
