mb|2S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: What is South worth, opposite a weak two in spades?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: pass|pg||
nt|brolucius: Facing a vulnerable 2@S, he might go to 4@S.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Depends on the style of the Weak Two |pg||
nt|royhughes: It's a great fit and reasonable game.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'm probably too high already opposite my partner's pre-empts|pg||
nt|xenya: i wouldn' dare to move|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|cuttysark: But your partner is not American, Roland |pg||
nt|Walddk2: True|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: East is not worth a raise now, I would say. Partner is in the protective seat and may already be hoping for more.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The weak two's in USA are more like Acol 2's|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This, however, seems pretty standard|pg||
nt|brolucius: The sixth spade is a bonus.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cuttysark: I think South has let West steal the partscore|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think it will be close whether this makes -- there is the potential for 9 tricks but declarer has work to do|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think he should have done something, if only to shut out the hearts|pg||
nt|brolucius: I agree. He might have gone to 3@S over 3@H.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Katz is  6 seed  Pepsi  14   for full team rosters check out  http://www.acbl.org/nabc/rosters/2009/01/VANDPRS/|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||

pc|s9|pc|hJ|nt|royhughes: I don't think declarer can lead towards his clubs twice|pg||
pc|c3|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c4|nt|royhughes: without losing a ruff the second time|pg||
nt|brolucius: In yesterday's match at this time, there was an unusual misture of underbidding and overbidding as the boards ticked by. Here it seems that South has underbid.|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think South might have bid if his partner's two promised 6 spades.  Otherwise, passing seems best|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, Roy, it's 1 off -- provided S ducks now of course|pg||
nt|brolucius: South could guess from his own singleton in hearts that E-W had at least a 9-card fit in hearts, so he should have been unwilling to allow them to play there.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: S has his hand folded up and is studying the dummy - now opened up hand, so...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Has the J out...|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|brolucius: Perhaps South had his hand folded up during the bidding.|pg||

mb|p|nt|royhughes: signals were not needed|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Can they find the heart fit? I doubt it|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|royhughes: whether or not they are playing Bart or similar|pg||
nt|brolucius: He will pass. Why not? Oh, he did not hear me.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with 5 clubs it looks better to support|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Trying to keep opponents out of diamonds, where they have 9 tricks|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, I like 3@c.  If partner has extra, he can show a 3-card heart suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or even 10|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sadek asks whether 2@c could be as few as 2 - Milner says 3+|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Yes, this is a perfect hand for the Bart convention|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Milner asks about leads "standard"|pg||
nt|xenya: identical auction in CR|pg||
nt|royhughes: NS missed the heart fit, but if playing a partscore it doesn't really matter|pg||
nt|brolucius: It might be only two clubs when the opening is 1@H, because opener can be 4-5-2-2 (unless, of course, the dreaded F******* is in operation).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/Bart.html|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Cohler telling Milner to hold his hand back - Sadek agrees - Cohler "I just know when I can see the hand it's time to say something :)"|pg||

mb|1H|nt|royhughes: Who bids on the West hand?|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: Pass seems old-fashioned|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Exactly - who passes these days?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Elahmady asked about how many diamonds Milner showed - 4+. From now on he'll be "E" because his name is too long for me :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now it's standard 2@S balance in my book|pg||
nt|brolucius: Roland, me, Sadek and Lev must be old fashioned, then.|pg||
nt|royhughes: could easily be true|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am sure he wil bid now|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Some people have asked about screens - yes, this match is played with screens, and yes, Cohler could actually see under the screen that his partner was holding his cards in a way ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: that they could be seen|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: EW are close to making 10 tricks -- maybe they can|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: and he did -- too late though|pg||
nt|brolucius: Amazing. Exactly the same auction as in the Closed Room.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: OK, "Waso" it is - his BBO name :)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|nt|royhughes: This is a game that makes with a few finesses and splits -- including the diamond 10 falling|pg||
nt|brolucius: West was fairly sure that neither North nor South held four spades. So the odds were good that his partner would have spade support.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The two pairs sitting out in this set are Katz-Jacobs and Narkiewicz-Buras (a young Polish pair)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|xenya: but the finesses are marked -- i don't think you need the @D10 to drop|pg||
nt|royhughes: no, you don't necessarily need it, but it may help|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: One of the young Poles came in at the beginning of the session to make sure they weren't playing and Cohler (who's really very funny) said "even our teammates come to play against ...|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Sadek actually put 1NT on the tray and then changed it to 1@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|brolucius: So many people nowadays respond 1@H on the East cards. I have no idea why. A sure 500 touch if ever I were to try it.|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, you can't always get away with stuff that other people do|pg||
nt|brolucius: North will go to 2@S now, but awkward if South has thought for ages.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Saved by the Screen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Chip Martel from USA|pg||

nt|royhughes: Hi Chip|pg||

pc|s2|nt|brolucius: 1@H is more pushy than the raise to 4@H, I would have thought.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|cuttysark: When 2 overbids meet - you get too hig|pg||
nt|chip: Here EW have a chance to stay low enough to go plus. Though only Reese would sell out to 2d with that S hand.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can say the same about the North hand. He had three-card spade support.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Has the spade Q out, but thinking about it|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d6|pc|s9|pc|s8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would balance with 2@S, not 1 I must confess. This looks like a 6-bagger to me|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, they should not sell out to 2@D when they have a spade fit.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No-one is going to penalise you when you have 150 honours|pg||
nt|royhughes: Sadek has a lot of finesses he would like to take, and not many entries|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|xenya: N would have done better to drop a @D honour |pg||
nt|xenya: not that it matters much here perhaps|pg||
nt|royhughes: That's a thought, but he may get a promotion if declarer ever leads a low trump|pg||
nt|chip: maybe lead trumps alone and take heart finesse through N?|pg||
nt|royhughes: I like that|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|brolucius: The 'always respond' school will no doubt ignore the minus 200 for 4@H in the Closed Room and carry on following their policy. I have never understood it.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|cuttysark: You need a wider spectrum of results before dismissing it :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Michael Rosenberg is one big supporter of that idea. He once tried to explain it to me.|pg||
nt|chip: Well, perhaps if playing the "always repond style" better to make the value 3H bid as W.|pg||
nt|chip: I like the style much better when NV (as does Michael I think)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that makes more sense.|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, 50 a trick is much nicer|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|nt|royhughes: I think a spade return, instead of the club, would have been harder on declarer here|pg||
pc|d7|nt|royhughes: But it was very complex|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|xenya: if S had played a @S promoting N's trump, N would have been endplayed -- sort of |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|h5|pc|c2|pg||

nt|Walddk2: This is my kind of slam  .... well, maybe not, it's too good|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Close to one of yours, Roland - needs a bit|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: The break was to try to see whether anything could be done about the temperature in the room - it's a little warm, except right where I am where it's freezing|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: I think a heart lead beats it|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|royhughes: sorry, I take that back|pg||
nt|brolucius: I suppose these breaks (as yesterday) are for smoking, but I'm surprised that is allowed. Yesterday a Swedish kibitzer told me that the hotel bathrooms were fitted with smoke ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: alarms there. It had never occurred to me that they had smoke alarms other than in planes.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: We should all have invested in smoke alarms|pg||
nt|brolucius: A raise of 1@S to 4@S usually denies a side singleton, or the opener would make a splinter bid. Here it is not attractive to splinter with a singleton high honour.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: The air conditioning here is right over my head and isn't very effective - if we can get it stronger, we'll move the table a little so I don't turn into an ice cube|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Milner did make a mini-splinter.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cuttysark: Yes, but that stiff king is a great card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Singleton king is not necessarily bad. Say partner has the ace and no @HK. Then there is a pitch available|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I'm not sure it was supposed to be "mini" - Cohler wrote something like 15-17 with shortness in diamonds|pg||
nt|royhughes: In six, you have to play all out, relying on clubs 3-3 and spades 2-2.  In game, he will probably play a little safer|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is often played as a form of raise to 3@S, not forcing to game.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: I don't think Milner will pre-balance here as Weinstein did in the other room|pg||
nt|brolucius: Weinstein bid boldly at the other table, finding a double over the 2@H rebid.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: At matchpoints North could justify balancing when 2@H runs to him (if South does not find a double). |pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Cohler asks about the NT range - 15-17|pg||
nt|xenya: but will he balance now?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|royhughes: I believe in balancing with 2S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: A closer decision at IMP perhaps. No, he has found the protection.|pg||

nt|chip: S did well to prebalance in the other room, as did N here (assuming S lets him out, and he has).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S could be very wrong because he doesn't know if E-W have a fit|pg||
nt|royhughes: It needn't work, but I don't worry about that|pg||
nt|brolucius: The pre-balancing double was borderline, as I see it, with only three spades.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East usually shows a 4-card fit these days|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but they could be on 5-2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Anyway, a spade is a spade|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chip: Yes, and it can be quite bad to bid over 2H if W was planning to bid game: risks a number and gives away the cards.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Yes, a take-out double would not be very attractive.|pg||

nt|cuttysark: You certainly would not fancy defending 3D doubled|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|royhughes: North has a difficult hand to evaluate -- I say not enough to try for slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: but those aces are attractive|pg||
mb|4S|nt|brolucius: A bit surprising that Levin settled for 4@S at the other table. 4@C seems much better.|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: I'd be tempted to bid on with the South hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D?|pg||
nt|chip: Leven-Weinstein play flanery I think, so S was likely to have 3 spades only.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Milner giving it a lot of thought|pg||
nt|brolucius: Five trumps and three aces is surely worth at least a slam try below the game level.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|nt|brolucius: A good stop after they had made a try.|pg||
nt|royhughes: Slam makes with hearts 3-3 and spades 3-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We lost the closed room temporarily|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Well, with the traditional 3-3 heart break, slam makes|pg||

mc|11|nt|royhughes: Yes, because you have to imagine all the things that could go wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I'm going to check on the other table|pg||
nt|xenya: i think S was right to pass -- after all, he has only 3 @Ss and he might have to use his high spades for ruffing, also his @Cs are not very good   |pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes 3@S and 4@D had shown what he had.|pg||
nt|royhughes: It's an interesting bidding problem.  I think the North hand has not enough fit or power to try for slam, but that depends on style|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It very much depends on whether South has 3 or 4-card support|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Another of these mysterious breaks, it seems.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: + you've already been warned that breaks may be bad, a spectator rightly points out|pg||
nt|royhughes: That's right.  There was a 4-4 fit available, too, which wouldn't have worked out very well.|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is the second break in 7 boards. A very tolerant TD.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jan went to check|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The closed room was down, but back now|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Technical problems when the world is online, it seems|pg||

nt|Walddk2: In theory there is a time limit per session, but penalties are rarely imposed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Playing with screens the limit would normally be 2 hours and 20 minutes for 16 boards|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Especially if the hold-up is not the players' fault|pg||
nt|brolucius: All very well for the players to have a quick cigarette when they are keeping only 3 players waiting, but what if there are 2000+ kibitzers twiddling their thumbs?|pg||
nt|reisig: when you score zero IMPs in 7 boards ...pull the plug :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes - trip over some wires, Richie :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: some players like to take a break just after they have bid a successful slam. To leave it on the BBO screen to be admired for 5 extra minutes.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: The players nicely took their normal board 8 break a board early so I could figure out the other table - back now|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Elahmady-Sadek have done particularly well in the Cavendish in recent years. A world class pair for sure|pg||
nt|chip: I doubt if 4H makes (repeated spade leads), but maybe.|pg||
nt|royhughes: The usual defense to a 4@h like this would be spades at every opportunity|pg||

pc|h4|nt|chip: but to be fair, if clubs were 3-1 would be the winner (4C and 3S down 1).|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I can't find a 9th trick. Anyone?|pg||
nt|royhughes: Some people overcall on 4-suits, bid 1NT freely, etc|pg||

nt|royhughes: If North had held the heart ace, he could give declarer a problem by taking the third round and leading a spade|pg||

mb|1S|nt|cuttysark: There doesn't seem much room to differentiate over 2NT between constructive and not|pg||
nt|chip: after the opening bid, EW may double 5C.|pg||
nt|chip: If it showed H+C can use 3D as a INV in hearts.|pg||
nt|brolucius: At last I am back, after AOL screwed me up. I expect I missed the best hand of the set.|pg||
nt|xenya: Last hand now and a few words of gratitude are in order. First, a big thank you to Jan Martel, our superb operator -- a really fantastic job! Our appreciations also to to the ACBL, ...|pg||
nt|xenya: Rick Beye and Jeff Johnson who have made it possible for us to watch this outstanding event. Thanks to my fellow commentators Roy, David, Liz, Chip and Roland for guiding us ...|pg||

mb|2N!|an|decent raise with 4 trumps?|nt|xenya: And, of course, to the spectators for their witty and helpful comments|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I think that E wrote this shows 4 hearts, can't see what else|pg||
nt|chip: Jan Martel also does most of the organizing of the vugraph show on-site.|pg||
nt|brolucius: AOL very kindly sends me update utl.4601 once or twice a day, which causes my connection to crash. When I complained about it, they said 'Where does that update come from?'. 'You!' ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: I replied.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sadek 1@H opener so much more effective than Lev's PASS|pg||
nt|chip: As I can attest from the 8Am calls we got from potential vu-graph operators.|pg||
nt|royhughes: Well done, Jan|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Many player use a cue-bid to show a three-card raise and 2NT to show a four-card raise. We noted on an earlier deal how important it is to know what sort of raise partner has.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Vugraphu1: Chip exagerates :) - it's a team effort!|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: Play will resume after a short break. 10 mins or so is my guess|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Great job, anyway - well done|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: The lights just went out in our room - now back on|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: no jan - that didn't really happen|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The conditions are more exciting than the bridge?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Nice effort by N-S on this board.|pg||
nt|xenya: well done indeed|pg||
nt|brolucius: Kibitzers say they should have taken 800. Not easy to judge that with such a big club fit. |pg||
nt|chip: If West's pass over 3C was weak, then seems E should pass now.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Yes, E is thinking - head in hands, cards on the table|pg||
nt|royhughes: Edgar Kaplan used to note that even non-vulnerable opponents sometimes make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i seem to recall Pasadena?  National in 80s where we had longer outage -- or was that the tourney with bomb scare|pg||
nt|brolucius: Whatever East does, except Pass, will be a cause of regret for him.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I think Pasadena was the bomb scare. Not sure what this was - AC and plug to my computer stayed on, just the lights went off|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Egyptian pair has played a fine session until this point. I am sure he will find the right answer.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: The SW players just looked at each other questioningly and made sort of shrugging gestures|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: Well done|pg||
