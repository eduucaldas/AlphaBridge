mb|p|mb|2S|mb|2N!|an|I think he said minors|mb|3H|nt|mariner1: 4 of either major here seems easy|pg||
nt|joest: Townsend picked the right moment to treat his handas both minors instead of just bidding diamonds!|pg||
nt|frankaus: exciting start|pg||
nt|dburn: 5@c seems a decent save, though|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes only 300|pg||
mb|5C|nt|dburn: might even escape for 100|pg||
nt|stewball: 2nt didnt deserve to get so lucky imo|pg||
nt|mwigor: how is it ever 300?|pg||
nt|dburn: but might also push Duboin to 5@h|pg||
nt|mariner1: ok only 100.... missed a spot|pg||
nt|dburn: since he can't really tell that 5@c won't actually make|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|frankaus: 5 level decisions always a hard part of the game|pg||

pc|c3|nt|mariner1: in Open W is playing 2@D|pg||
nt|stewball: apparently S was even tempted to play 2@c X|pg||
nt|joest: it wasn't beyond the realmfor duboin to play for penalties in 2@c. That's most of his hand.  |pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|dburn: I had thought Duboin might pass out 2@c doubled, but the Italians very rarely pass out one of their "card-showing" doubles|pg||
nt|joest: Maybe SEmenta thought that if Duboin couldn't bid 3NT or pass 2@c doubled that all his values were elsewhere|pg||
nt|frankaus: lucky to catch JT @H in dummy - unlucky - they break 5-0|pg||
nt|mariner1: so this will make the match really close|pg||
nt|mwigor: presumably the JT were part of the reason sementa didnt just pass out 2@h|pg||
nt|mariner1: could have a new leader|pg||
nt|stewball: well his dbl looks routine to me|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I'm showing a new operator how to do this and she just asked me why Townsend looks so sad :) - He does look very serious and not at all like someone with AK986 of trumps |pg||
nt|stewball: poker face|pg||
nt|mwigor: tom isnt known for gaiety|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open  W 1@H - 1@S - DBL - P - 2@D swish|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|hT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|frankaus: bidding the up is working for Gold & Towsend|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|c4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|stewball: best cash his @d now.....|pg||
nt|dburn: this looks to be down two, which will be a significant gain for Rosenthal whether 2@d makes at the other table or not|pg||
pc|s4|nt|stewball: Gold looks like he's suit preferencing @ds|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: Yes, where else can his values be? But no rush|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|h6|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d!|an|4+spades?|mb|2H|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|dburn: double probably shows four or five spades|pg||
mb|4H|an|transfer|nt|mwigor: i think X shows 4/5 @s for duboin-sementa|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|joest: yes it does|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: nice auction by NS|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mariner1: N is in 4@S in Open here|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sementa explained 4@h as a transfer "it's game forcing"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In theory E-W have 4 tricks, but they can't get them|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|joest: Duboin will have to work clubs right to make it|pg||
nt|joest: this one is MUCH easier to make looking at all four hands|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Duck or win, doesn't matter as long as he gets clubs right|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Duboin asks about 2@h and Townsend says it was a bad raise|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mariner1: off in Open so chance to retake lead here|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|dburn: the eight is the systemic shift from K98xx or K98xxx|pg||
nt|joest: if Townsend-Gold playing 3rd and low here, Gold can work out to duck|pg||
nt|dburn: so Gold may be in some doubt as to whether to play the queen here|pg||
nt|joest: but not if from K98xx|pg||
nt|stewball: duboin may well play on @ds insted of @cs|pg||
nt|joest: luckily for him it doesn't matter|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Ah, more discussion - it seems that Sementa explained 3@h as game forcing, not 4@h :)|pg||
nt|dburn: well, West did not continue diamonds despite East's encouraging @d5 at trick one|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Gold asking about S's shape|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|dburn: so Duboin may have an idea of the diamond position|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Possible shapes that is|pg||
nt|joest: Duboin should be 4-4 in diamonds and spades|pg||
nt|dburn: but still, he might attempt to play West for such as @dQJ or even @dQJx|pg||
nt|stewball: indeed|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I believe they said 4+ diamonds and 4 spades|pg||
nt|dburn: trying to establish a diamond winner without letting East on lead|pg||
nt|joest: Giorgio will be doing very well to roll this home|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He will make it. Gold can't have @DKJ and @CA for his bad raise, and Townsend can't do without all of them for his vulnerable overcall. Any bets?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: + @HQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Duboin had the diamond 8 out of his hand, but then put it back and now is studying dummy, thinking|pg||
nt|stewball: i bet he goes down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: taken|pg||
nt|mariner1: I'm in|pg||
nt|stewball: 5/1 @ds and both @c's offside seems a little much|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Fingering a spade now, now @d8,...|pg||
nt|stewball: he will hope the @c suit is frozen...|pg||
nt|joest: seems to me like you have to work trumps before fiddling with diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As David said, why did Townsend not continue diamonds?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Shrugging, looking at Townsend, fanning his cards, folding them up again|pg||
nt|dburn: if he knew that South had four, he would probably shift anyway|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: now has the @sk out|pg||
nt|joest: Giorgio doesn't know that spades are 2-2 so he has hearts to worry about too..|pg||
nt|mariner1:  http://www.acbl.org/nabc/index.php?a=2009&b=Spring&c=daily_bulletins  -  Daily|pg||
nt|mariner1: Bulletins|pg||
nt|mwigor: as it turns out he cant really get @c wrong - but playing a low @d either before or after drawing trump is fatal|pg||
nt|mariner1: he knows A@C is in W though or most likely to be there|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: folded hand up again, put his head in his hands and is thinking some more|pg||
nt|mwigor: even if he plays the @cJ and runs it and then the @cK the @c7 sets up with one ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he should make.  2 spades ending in dummy  a diamond when east splits, the diamond position is known for sure and the a club toward the jack -- Barry Goren and Irwin Boris|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: That seems to be a fine line|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.acbl.org/nabc/rosters/2009/01/VANDPRS/ - Teams|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: shuffling between the @s Q and @s 5 now, looking off into space for inspiration|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Sementa asking about possible hand patterns for dummy - could be 4225 or 4414 but not 4144 (would have opened 1@d)|pg||
nt|mwigor: if townsend had identified his shortage below 3@s then perhaps came could be avoided|pg||

nt|mwigor: doesnt matter what he does|pg||

nt|joest: if he pitches, Sementa ruffs, ruffsout the club ace, pulls trump and tosses West in with the spade who has to put him back in dummy|pg||
nt|passell:  no entry for the ruffing finesse|pg||
nt|stewball: and a magic carpet ride|pg||
nt|stewball: back to dummy|pg||
nt|mwigor: townsend's hand provides the so called magic carpet ride|pg||

nt|joest: the ace of clubs is ruffed out|pg||
