mb|2C|nt|idc: and you can't get the contracts anymore either - 1@h at the other table isn't going to set our pulses racing|pg||

mb|d|nt|bcallaghan: Danger of getting too high in spades.|pg||
nt|keylime: 2@d Multi to start from North|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@S either multi or weak majors|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D|pg||

nt|Walddk2: If 3@H showed his hand, he should not overrule partner's decision to defend|pg||
nt|idc: ok, my pulse is racing now, I admit that|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW can make 3N here if they get there|pg||

pc|c8|nt|ianrei: and west's X showed 3H|pg||
nt|galadriel: I'm with you Brian|pg||
nt|ianrei: responses to 1C are transfer|pg||

pc|d2|nt|galadriel: Ah, even after overcall?|pg||

nt|vugraphznb: sry the thinking is by S not E|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|bridge_one: guessing|pg||
nt|neobas: No problem. To avoid players benefitting from operators, operaters are enjoined to enter two bids at the time - as the tray goes through|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: tell them to hurry up!! im getting sleepy... |pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: Bas always asks them, "why did you bid that?"  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|neobas: Coffee works Yonathan :) Ask for a cup of water and dip some in your face - trick I use when operating :)|pg||
nt|neobas: Haha, only befriended players :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|galadriel: Still time to recover in this match|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Brain Callaghan from England|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: yes 1400 was not good|pg||
pc|d4|nt|galadriel: Hello Brian|pg||
nt|keylime: here, a measly 1@s. |pg||
nt|mariner1: 1400 and 1@S  not a balance|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: EW play a multi-way 1@C with transfer responses and a strong NT|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I remember the BBO usernames of East and South. Boeles is gnasher and Gillis is Capercliff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bowles|pg||
