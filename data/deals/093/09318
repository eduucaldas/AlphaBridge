nt|mwigor: so he might go two down|pg||
nt|joest: and 4=4=3=2 pattern|pg||
nt|joest: the problem is that would mean he has no club king|pg||

nt|mwigor: gertsman will be grateful he has 4@c and wasnt 5233 in a second|pg||
nt|joest: right|pg||
nt|joest: no guarantee partner has four!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Cheapest bid, may be a 3 card suit.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: how about an invite of 4@C, 3@S or double just confuse the issue|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|joest: well for one 4@c goes past 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: I agree I don't like 'double'|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the odds 2@C is a three card suit are really low with south's shape, although it is possible|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south hand is totally unsuitable for no trump|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: where are the running tricks opposite a single stopper|pg||
nt|santyclz: Agreed, but much more likely than 2@d would have been.|pg||
nt|joest: but north's bidding is consistent with a 5=3=2=3 bad hand|pg||
nt|mwigor: or 5233|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so my 4@C is better, agree?|pg||
nt|joest: 3NT had some angles|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if your going to pull 3NT anyway|pg||
nt|mwigor: martin's point is a good one|pg||
nt|mwigor: the argument 4@c goes past 3NT is only valid if you're going to pass 3NT when partner bids it|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||
nt|mwigor: some kibitzers suggest 4@c over 3NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think 3@s then 4@c would do justice to the s hand.|pg||
nt|mwigor: the problem there is that some (most?) play that a runout from 3NT undoubled to 4m is forcing|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|c6|nt|mwigor: 3N certainly wasnt forced|pg||
nt|santyclz: It was if n had a stop.|pg||
nt|mwigor: but once it has been bid it precludes us running to 4m unless they double|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|joest: Sutherlin obviously took the most aggressive view since he forced to 5 by himself|pg||
pc|sK|pc|cT|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|mwigor: presumably he could have passed 4@c from partner|pg||
pc|d2|nt|joest: my view about the bidding is bottomed on my concern with partner not really having clubs.  Others aren't as worried about that and they might be right|pg||
mc|10|nt|mwigor: i'm with you jack (i think 3@c is a real fear)|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||

nt|fabsayc: yes, there is no clear cut safety play but low to jack does seem a little better than from the top|pg||
nt|mwigor: and hooking on the way back would lose on the actual layout|pg||
nt|mwigor: leading the Jack and running it picks up QTxx with north|pg||
nt|mwigor: and an overtrick on this layout|pg||
nt|joest: loses to Q10xx with south|pg||
