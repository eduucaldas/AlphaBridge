nt|kareno: But I wouldn't fade even a ten cent bet on the subject.|pg||

nt|stewball: well i know i dont agree with Zia|pg||
nt|kareno: I hope the spades aren't compressed by the defense.|pg||
nt|stewball: he has lousy @h spots for trump plays|pg||
nt|kareno: I prefer Hamman's club attack though.|pg||
nt|chick: when partner starts a forcing defense, trying to switch to playing trumps is kinda self-defeating|pg||
nt|stewball: its so easy from up here|pg||
nt|chick: yeah, but that's still a general statement ... should continue the defense partner started (if you trust him/her) unless you can see an obvious reason not to|pg||

nt|idblu: seems a popular trend these days to overcall NT with stiff honours|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|idblu: points first....shape later|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|geot: the problem with 1NT is that you may end up in 2@H sometimes, but even that can work ok on a 5-1|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idblu: was 2@H a transfer?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: i believe so|pg||

nt|geot: and South is lacking alternatives, if he isn't the type who like "wait and see bridge"|pg||
nt|idblu: well then..all's well that ends well :)|pg||

nt|kareno: Making it is a lot harder than bidding it in this case.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu1: Zia asks about lead - honor lead either shows or asks for honor below it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c7|nt|stewball: cant blame Hamman for overbidding slightly] to show his whole hand|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kareno: What is the range of their notrump?  Nine with a five-card suit is plenty if it's 15-17.|pg||

mb|2C|nt|vugrapha1: not really|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: but that hand wasnt going to swing more than an IMP|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|geot: Another quite straightforward game contract now. Probably no swing|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mariner1: 2@C showing cards here...........|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: E has a 4 @H call if he thinks W has 5@H|pg||
nt|idblu: he might be afraid that W only has 4@H, but he has no other call than 4@H|pg||
nt|geot: Does it have to be 5? Dont think so|pg||
nt|idblu: 2@C normally says you pick, I don't have a clear cut call|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes many of us would have bid 2@H over the 1@C DBL|pg||
nt|geot: I think W also had a good option in just jumping to 4@H, or at least over pd 3@C jump to 4@H. East should have at least three hearts |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|geot: I think 2@H is a bit to little for a response to the double|pg||
nt|geot: on this hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: so we will have a new leader......... sometimes you can get too fancy|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: i can certainly see how ian might well have thought 3@c created a GF|pg||
nt|idblu: somebody's Qbid must have been game forcing|pg||
nt|idblu: 10 imps to the Green team to take the lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: E might have thought W was showing 4 4 majors and there were probably 4 or more|pg||
nt|mariner1: losers in 4@H,,,,,,|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|stewball: i'm told 3@h didnt promise 4@s..|pg||
nt|kareno: In the other match, 4@s is the contract on this board for those who like to comparison shop :)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|nt|chick: that may not fare so well|pg||
nt|stewball: very reasonable of them|pg||
mb|1H|mb|4H|nt|Vugraphu1: Zia writing a note, probably that he had stronger raises available -|pg||
nt|kareno: Sort of a rattlesnake double by south but it does not show any diamond tolerance at all apparently.|pg||
nt|stewball: i expect he had other openings available as well|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|stewball: this 1@c looks like a Ziaism but i could be wrong|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|mariner1: well if they do not get the ruff in declarer might play for the drop|pg||

nt|geot: yes, it is all about the trumps guess...and it is easier for us to drop the queen. South may hold 4 hearts from start|pg||
nt|mariner1: trying a @c to dummy risks a ruff if Q in N ( and another @S ruff @c ruff)|pg||

nt|mariner1: yes and when you have other information|pg||
nt|geot: he cant run the 10 now....should have ruffed diamond with the ten....to go wrong....:)|pg||
nt|idblu: some people know the real numbers....some know by intuition, or as often called...table presence|pg||
nt|mariner1: he should have ruffed that @D high also|pg||
