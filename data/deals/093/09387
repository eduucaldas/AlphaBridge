nt|Walddk2: A lot of if's, but if EBU can hold on to a lead around 40 (21-9), England must win the second half by 50 IMPs against Wales to win the Camrose Trophy. So EBU in a very strong ...|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3 boards to play,,,,, next session scheduled for 32 minutes from now|pg||
mb|p|nt|bcallaghan: Presumably 4C a cue.  Maybe 3H a genral slam try in spades works better.  Don't know their methods.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree Brian, and let 4m be a splinter|pg||
pc|hK|nt|idc: i expect you are right Brian - if 4@c were a splinter, the South hand has improved, if not, I prefer his 4@s signoff|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Finally some IMPs to Scotland. Must be your presence, Ian|pg||
nt|idc: though trumps are so good I might go for 4@h amyway|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: The main danger was that trumps weren't solid enough.  Not sure they addressed that, but OK here.  |pg||
nt|idc: thx Roland but the reality is once I start talking about bridge, the other Scottish players just *seem* better :)|pg||
nt|galadriel: I think N just decided he was going to be in slam when his pd showed a @S fit, and to be fair, he does have a nice hand|pg||
nt|idc: Interesting auction in other room - transfer to @s and then a forcing 3@s bid by North|pg||
nt|idc: (they transfer with 4+ suits on some hand types) - presumably that invited South to cue but he didn't, and 4@s it was|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: That diamond again, says Gillis to himself|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Presumably, in the other room, 4S meant somethin.  Good trumps?  Otherwise 3NT an alternative.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|bridge_one: 6@C are made for the dispositions of @h suit|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mariner1: very true Bas, many who open light have no controls and they get too high easily|pg||
nt|neobas: Yup, handy @HTx in N|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphznb: drums.....|pg||
nt|mariner1: how do you get rid of the @D loser?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|neobas: Tricky X by W, some might pass|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: well Zadik save them?|pg||
nt|mariner1: and you have a @H loser too|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@C seems to have no play with good defense|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a false rever at 2@h - can be dangerous, but i agree|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mariner1: N should pass,,|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 4 tricks in @H, 5@c 1@s 2@d - 6@H are impossible to beat|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@C|pg||
nt|irwinbo: the two heart bid was odd to me  3c makes more sense|pg||
nt|neobas: Yup, and now XX should've been 3@C imo|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: Rdbl is a gambling hoping in long and good @S in W|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|mariner1: yes I guess you can get 4@H in to make|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: well this is an interesting spot|pg||
nt|neobas: I expect some screenpoking after this board :)|pg||
nt|irwinbo: will he take three or four tricks?|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is like a deviant to Fudd's First Law of Opposition|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4|pg||
nt|neobas: I expect four as well|pg||
nt|neobas: @CA and 3@S?|pg||
nt|mariner1: the deviant is = If you dig a deep enough hole, everybody'll want to jump into it.|pg||

pc|s4|nt|bridge_one: now 10 in @H |pg||
nt|bridge_one: if East J in @h and K in @C, South will discard a @d|pg||
nt|mariner1: he is doomed now I think|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mariner1: what?|pg||
nt|neobas: This was doomed from before the lead :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|mariner1: 10@H won that trick?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: RIGHT (9@c)|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: yes|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1010 with give Scotland another imp|pg||
nt|idc: Was it John Matheson?|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: On top club lead might be 1010.|pg||
nt|idc: If so, someone should tell him 1978 is over now and he can start bidding them again|pg||
nt|keylime: N-S has had much of the play this match,and the score is showing, along with very active biddings in the CR|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board of the session........ next session in 26 minutes|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Operator, you sure he did not make them all?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he did, I'll give you the code for correction|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Sorry, does look like it should be 1010 in any case.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: He claimed 12 ... they are discussing it.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: E-W should give him one more|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Not if he thought his diamond suit was good.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The code is  6SS+1|pg||

mb|p|pc|dK|nt|galadriel: 11 even|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|keylime: the dummy is not much of comfort for declarer - the heart suit is a lacking of a fourth trump a potential bother|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mariner1: how to play the @S......  normally one thinks S has more dues to 3@D call|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|mariner1: and of course he needs to ruff out the @D|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||

nt|idc: Interesting 1@h overcall from Howard - when you play very agressive style, that hand is too good/defensive for a weak jump at these colours|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mariner1: averaging 8 imps a board so far..........|pg||
nt|keylime: declarer's getting frisky here|pg||
pc|d5|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|keylime: and dodges a bullet.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|d7|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s5|mc|9|nt|keylime: and now is down in a somewhat tricky but makeable contract|pg||
nt|mariner1: and still the average continues|pg||

nt|mariner1: still will get a good score I think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: good job by South, but a little help by E/W|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: did i mention that it has been a realy long day?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H good spot here NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi this is Mike from Uk late as i was in another vu graph session|pg||

mb|2D|nt|lestergold: hi Bas|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|vugraphznb: all players are in total darkness, everybody is tired|pg||
nt|lestergold: a double from south and they should reach 4h which can be held to 4 i think on a spade lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: i assume this is butler scoring not mps?|pg||
nt|mariner1: everyone looking to use Littlewood's Law|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|neobas: Butler indeed|pg||
nt|bridge_one: IMP|pg||
nt|mariner1: IMPs across the field  pairs|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@H now ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|neobas: Tricky, S might also have doubled with 4@Ss and 3@Hs, I think|pg||
nt|lestergold: and hi Georgio!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bridge_one: 4@H is correct with 6@C - give the chance to play one of 2 suit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello MIKE :)|pg||
nt|irwinbo: but 4d may be better|pg||
nt|bridge_one: J in @S best lead|pg||
nt|neobas: 4@D might show a 4-4-2-3 though?|pg||
nt|mariner1: can hold this to 4 with that lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with all high cards in @H/@C 4@H isn't a bad bid|pg||
nt|irwinbo: if partner bids 4h, fine if he bids 4 spades you go on to 5 clubs|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mariner1: I am assuming he will hook @H though|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|s6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bridge_one: Ok Irwin, but if p hold 3@h and singleton in @C with 4@h you could play 4@h ..|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bridge_one: bidding 4@d you will play 5@C instaed|pg||

mb|1N|nt|idc: 9 to win the first round anyone?|pg||
nt|idc: or the 10 ... 10 i think|pg||

nt|mariner1: job!!!|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|bcallaghan: I would have tried to get to 2C with the South hand.  Maybe it's Stayman.|pg||
nt|idc: in 1NT doubled, even more fun - East leads a small @d, later run of diamonds puts West hand under some pressure|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: I think top diamond lead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: as we finish up, we wish to thank the CCBA and the Shenyang Bridge Association for this event|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Right, they could easily be running|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And if not, still hope that @SK is an entry|pg||
nt|idc: true, but that takes away the fun, just a boring -1 i think|pg||
nt|mariner1: many thanks to all the organizers and sponsors, the CBF and all for helping BBO|pg||
nt|mariner1: bring us the vugraphs!|pg||
nt|keylime: also, a big thanks to my tag team partner, Rob Brown, from the Pacific NW|pg||
mb|p|pc|c8|nt|bcallaghan: West may still be squeezed.|pg||

pc|sT|nt|idc: I suppose 4 hcp opposite 15-17, gamble on it making isn't so weird, down in the match etc|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|lestergold: as dim ace is right and clubs are three its 200%!|pg||

nt|neobas: Yup|pg||
mb|p|nt|neobas: Pitch a @D on the 4th @C|pg||

nt|neobas: Either @DA onside or @Cs 3/3|pg||
nt|lestergold: one or the other is needed|pg||
nt|mariner1: or a @D lead|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i think it is 36% for the 3-3 clubs and one half of the remaining 64% or 68% in total|pg||

nt|bridge_one: also A in East singleton|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 3@s means ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: I was not suggesting it woul be led,,, I said IF :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: however the interesting question is will they get there for a big score?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no singleton, so can keep a void ?|pg||
