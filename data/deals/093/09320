nt|daman: and welcome|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome to the 1st of 4 16 board sets to determine one finalist for the 2009 Vanderbilt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nickell team is the  1 seed -- and had the 4th set off last night following an early concession|pg||
nt|daman: starting off with a hand for EW   either 4@H or 3NT     3NT  of Hamman has his way|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: Diamond, the  12 seed -- ran late last night and won in a squeeker|pg||
nt|daman: if*|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|dburn: doubtless they spent it in carousal, while Moss, who had to struggle to the semi-final, is battle-hardened|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17   3@S=shortness and as you see does NOT deny 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: recheck -- singleton @S and GUARANTEE 4@H|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|othered1: @S lie well for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think it was one of Lew Mathe's rules --  Never Lead Trump .... unless it's right|pg||
nt|chip: The spades spot let him pick up the suit for 3 tricks (which with 5 hearts and the club ace makes 9) if he plays W for H9x|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: well 4 @S not sure either though|pg||
nt|mariner1: N having long @S with short @H prevents the make|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: S did not know that though|pg||

nt|daman: @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would have been great to see Moss PASS artificial 2@D bid|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@D likely a non-hopeless 4-card raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: and i guess 2@H must show @D|pg||

pc|h4|nt|mrdct: this is a barometer movement so each table is playing the same boards at the same time|pg||

nt|mariner1: Open failed to find the line|pg||

nt|joest: some risk for Lauria that if he continues spades, Levin might clear them and then Weinstein runs them when in with the club|pg||
