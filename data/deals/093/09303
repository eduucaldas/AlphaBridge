nt|sybarra: and Joey Silver may join in at his leisure|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Wont enjoy it if he does|pg||
nt|sharkey: see they're down quite a bit on the list - the field here, however, is awfully tough|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Declarer needs to finesse to ensure no entry to South for a heart through|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mmmakela: Apteker means "pharmacist" in Swedish|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sunsamvar: and the distractions many :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sharkey: think a plus here is a good score|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hanlon took the low route here and decided not to stretch for the non vulgame|pg||
nt|sharkey: limited communications between the hands makes game tough|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.  Hi Cornelia, Markku.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: any votes for 3 NT by S?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i suppose Zmud with his 5 crd support had to bid 5@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: yes @S lead and continuation will force declarer to lose trump control|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sharkey: i think defence will prevail unless declarer can drop @CQ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|othered1: Now Wiz is down, if NS get this right|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: A technical error by Seamon I think|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: with little defence against 5@C|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in 4@H ie|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mmmakela: instead of 4 H|pg||
nt|santyclz: With 3 unsupported kings?  Can't imagine why.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|me argent: im not entirely objective since jc and i play together|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|aupillon: one down, because it's Friday 13th :(|pg||
nt|tweety1: singleton is not useful in NT game.|pg||
nt|fann4: This will likely make. The @C will take care of some @D losers.|pg||
nt|paulg: and East can never get in|pg||
nt|aupillon: there are 4 losers. Timing and lead will show us|pg||
nt|tweety1: will lead @s or @c A?|pg||
nt|paulg: @cA and another would give the defence a chance|pg||
nt|fann4: When a @C is led towards dummy, if W takes the A it's easy. If he ducks, there is more work to do|pg||
nt|aupillon: spade, i suppose|pg||
pc|h6|nt|aupillon: good too|pg||
nt|tweety1: hard to set this 4 @h.|pg||
nt|fann4: Natural way to play this is to win in hand and play a @C|pg||
nt|aupillon: because, as someone said , East is unable to tkake the hand|pg||
nt|tweety1: he will do it Jeff i suppose|pg||

nt|mmmakela: 5@C dbl par|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: The 2@S opening shutting out NS I think|pg||
mb|2H|nt|santyclz: 4@s theoretically much better.  |pg||
nt|mmmakela: as a bid yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: easy @h game here|pg||
nt|sharkey: S's hand awkward; @SQ poorly placed, only 3 @H, and @D not good enough|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Rusinow lead - lower of touching honors|pg||
mb|p|pc|s7|nt|othered1: nice choice of high lead, here|pg||

nt|paulg: no real reason to do that though, when the @c10 might be coming down|pg||
mb|1D|nt|paulg: but probably better to lead a club from hand at trick 2 as you said|pg||

mb|1H|nt|vugrapha2: sorry|pg||
mb|1S|nt|robinswr: especially when hearts are clearly the trump suit|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: easy 6@H here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but n/s may barrage in @S|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sharkey: previous hand easier if S leads low @D - then he can cash 2nd @D trick after ruff - makes it easier for pd|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|chick: goulash is right, markku :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: brave bid by south|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Yes there is much to be said for using kickback Blackwood when the trump suit is a minor or @H|pg||
nt|robinswr: before North bid rkc he had to go over the responses and think about the 5spade response|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: may end up in6@C.. which also makes|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - not sure if 4@S has any significance aside from being forcing|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|othered1: nicely done|pg||
pc|hA|nt|robinswr: the 10 of clubs would make life difficult for weinstein|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: meanwhile the Americans in the open room did well to sacrifice in 5@C on bd 2...|pg||
nt|robinswr: but should make since he has two entries and the ak of spades is onsides|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but lost 11 imps cause here they overshot to the doomed 6@H|pg||
nt|robinswr: the 3 of clubs shows an honor since they would lead second without one|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: W is thinking|pg||
nt|robinswr: he would also lead the 3 from K963|pg||

mb|3C|nt|fann4: Interesting response of 3NT by W in the CR (Closed Room)|pg||
nt|tweety1: NS defended badly either|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: this will not approve 2 @s bid.|pg||

nt|paulg: 3NT is a fair shot|pg||
nt|aupillon: i bet on 4 4 hearts|pg||
nt|paulg: as they will rarely lead clubs and will probably lead up to one of your kings|pg||
mb|3N|nt|tweety1: 3nt |pg||
nt|aupillon: VERY nice|pg||
nt|sybarra: jrs. bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: (or expert) |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|paulg: however, North knows that the clubs are not solid, so he may lead @cK|pg||
nt|tweety1: wow|pg||
nt|fann4: Nice flair in both rooms. 3NT could be in trouble on a pointed lead (@S or @D) to the A and the other suit back, but it's a good choice.|pg||
nt|tweety1: dbl =  lead @h?  heheh|pg||
nt|fann4: I do not understand this double at all.|pg||
nt|tweety1: a very primitive meaning of such doubles =  lead for me:)|pg||
nt|tweety1: so @h|pg||
nt|fann4: A confused South may try 4@D and then W has an easy 4@H|pg||
nt|tweety1: lets see|pg||
mb|4D|nt|paulg: why is south confused?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|aupillon: i was a bit absent/disconn. The main problem with my all anglosaxons friends is that they fit with 3 cards a response on an opening in a major/. They was tempted by Moïse, not the ...|pg||
nt|aupillon: real guy, but by Alfred J. Moise who loved to play 43 fits. I agrre with that ONLY if you play with Radu from Grnoblr. A good card player. Otherwise NOT|pg||
nt|fann4: Perhaps because he may be wondering what hand his partner has after W bids 3NT, which shows a good hand.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fann4: I suppose the dbl must show short @C and a good hand though|pg||
mb|4S|nt|paulg: even vulnerable there can be element of gambling 3N|pg||
nt|aupillon: aïe caramba|pg||
nt|fann4: Fair enough|pg||
nt|tweety1: does N's dbl have a special meaning by any chance?|pg||
nt|tweety1: vughraph?|pg||
nt|aupillon: a certain optimism|pg||
nt|vugraphzkw: y|pg||
nt|paulg: as far as South is concerned, it does look like a double fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|aupillon: 4/3 fit ? You got it|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tweety1: hard to find 3-3 @s split in this auction...|pg||
nt|aupillon: many tricks down below, we'll try to understand the meaning of the double, at the corner of the bar|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fann4: On the surface it looks like 4 down, but will only be 3 down on an endplay|pg||
nt|tweety1: oy oy|pg||

nt|chick: good disciplined pass|pg||
nt|santyclz: 6 tricks in hand, no defense.|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: 4@S is a slim if any hope|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|othered1: woinder if 3@S is weaker than pass, since west has shown 4@S with 2@S bid|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Jimmy Cayne says the war iks o ver for the moment|pg||

pc|hA|nt|vugrapha2: Michael Seamon flasecards on most hands as declarer but has kept the @D8 here|pg||
