nt|kareno: Yes, to me more of a weak 2 at the vulnerability.|pg||
nt|kareno: No that pair is more sober :)|pg||
nt|chthonic: : |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd seat vul -- i think 2@S should be better suit or shape -- but not dogmatic about it|pg||
nt|jallerton: S lacking in controls.  Will he try NT?|pg||
nt|kareno: South's should be only an invitation if north's is an opening bid!|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|jallerton: Meckwell bid and made 3NT.  Well done.|pg||
nt|kareno: The 2@s bid is a warning of a light, distributional opening bid.|pg||

pc|h2|nt|jallerton: Presumably W led a heart|pg||
