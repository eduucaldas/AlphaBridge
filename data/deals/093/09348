nt|santyclz: As Kaplan used to say:  I have nothing against opening a (weak) nt with a 5-card suit, I just haven't come across the right hand yet.|pg||

mb|4S|nt|idblu: but 23 can not be a win for them...that I can see|pg||

nt|idblu: 3NT would be a great contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|olson: double of  5s  is not  advised|pg||

nt|davidstern: You obviously dont play with my partner six is too long|pg||
nt|davidstern: 1@C more likely to get to slam|pg||
nt|yo_yo: very difficult |pg||
nt|olson: 2s makes 3  on the 5/2|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Anything else will make slam more difficult|pg||

nt|yo_yo: yes  well done |pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|idblu: not easy to play tho...|pg||
nt|olson: this is not easy to play    S  only  has  2 entries  and needs to lead to dummy 3 times   twice in spades and once in diamonds|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: once in @S is enuff, with 2nd sight|pg||
nt|olson: N can duck the first diamond|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|davidstern: On the cards with hearts 3-3 and trumps 2-1 it makes with almost any combination of North cards|pg||
pc|c6|nt|othered1: But I'll bet her fingers are still crosses|pg||
nt|davidstern: She will be deeling better now|pg||
nt|olson: this play is unlikely to work  |pg||
nt|idblu: down from the getgo|pg||
nt|olson: are they leading 1/3/5  or  2/4  vs  suits ? |pg||
nt|idblu: ploanning to throw 2@D|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: notionaly 2/4|pg||
nt|idblu: this is a friendly defense|pg||
nt|olson: then the 8 would have been  3rd  from  Q98  or  W  did not have the Q|pg||
nt|olson: c  to ace and  dia to 9  next for  8 winner s|pg||
nt|olson: the dia   finesse  is 50%  the clubs  3/3  is  36%|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugrapha2: right|pg||
pc|s5|nt|olson: E  should  return  Club Q   at  trick  2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|davidstern: How do you play it - hearts to break or ruff one diamond|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think 5@C must be strong at that vulnerability|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|othered1: You also have @CQxx possibly in play|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|davidstern: Would you open it with an ace and 9 solid clubs missing the ace - probably - still lots of losers|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: 8+2+2|pg||
nt|davidstern: ah sorry there are 12 top tricks|pg||
nt|davidstern: Asleep|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i might have drawn trumps by now|pg||
nt|idblu: will make now....|pg||
nt|olson: the  goal  would  be to force  N  to  ruff  a few clubs and  strand  S  in dummy having to lead  diamonds  from the board|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|olson: both work this time,  but  you presume the other table knows  % plays and will go after the diamond  for an 8th winner|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: i think @C were 4-2 but south pitcvhed one|pg||
nt|olson: should be a fast claim now|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|davidstern: Declarer flirting a little|pg||

nt|othered1: no.  My minor suit openings aren't to be toyed with :)|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: went a bit quick at the end|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|vugrapha2: just chat|pg||
mb|1N|nt|othered1: Actually, with only an 8-count and a non-solid suit, 2@C is forced once I open 1@C|pg||
nt|idblu: this should beget 5@C|pg||
nt|olson: on a non H lead  6s  is possible    |pg||
mb|p|nt|idblu: 7 can make double dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|olson: it is possible in a  H  lead   but  needs   xray vision  to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: do we like that 2@H bid?|pg||
nt|othered1: If it's their system . . .  but I wonder about it opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|olson: normal spot|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|yo_yo: a horrid 5 card suit  vul?|pg||
nt|idblu: yes|pg||
nt|olson: E should  cash  D  ace   guarding  against  sing  K  or  J  in North|pg||
nt|olson: win  H ace  important nowe  to lead  to  dia  KQ|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|idblu: 6@S....beyond my capabilities|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|yo_yo: Ed i bet the rubber bridge players wouldnt bid that |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|olson: w  hoped  the  4s  bid  had a club  void  semi  solid  trumps  and a  red  king  :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|olson: this is not  good|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|idblu: why would she expect a @C void...she only had 1 @C|pg||
nt|olson: now  must play  @D  to  Q  to  make|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: I don't have the stomach to play that myself, however.  At any  game.|pg||
nt|idblu: this would not be my line of play|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|olson: s  should have cashed  second spade|pg||
pc|c7|nt|olson: it was  correct  to play  on diamonds  in order  to  dispose  of the  losing  H|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c2|nt|yo_yo: actually that's a good yard stick, If it's not fit for rubber bridge, it's not fit for imps|pg||
nt|idblu: I would think so|pg||
pc|c6|nt|othered1: On the other hand, NS are getting slaughtered, and maybe it was a state of the match effort|pg||
nt|yo_yo: however it came out ok|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes maybe, but do they know that?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
mc|7|nt|olson: there  is no  justice  when  the slam makes  on this  play  |pg||
nt|olson: m1 now  normal  since the spade 9 finesse would have risked the contract for an overtrick and S  would not do that|pg||
pg||

nt|idblu: then can't make|pg||
nt|olson: yes  still makes  since  no dia  loser  after  low  to Q|pg||
nt|idblu: my error|pg||
nt|olson: you cannot get 82 imps back  1 at a time,  need  larger  swings|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2D!|an|multi|nt|olson: the  K  is finessed  even without  the  unblock  play by  declarer|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: the usual kind...|pg||
mb|2N|nt|yo_yo: i thought i saw NS play 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|idblu: still makes....late here in Canada....|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: personally I would bid 3 with the NOrth hand|pg||
mb|3H|an|xfer|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|olson: 3n  is  normal here,   but  every suit  is bad for  declarer|pg||
mb|3N|nt|othered1: south's 18 count diminished with every opposing call|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah i cant count, i thought 17|pg||
nt|olson: W  might  get  endplayed  later  and  have to concede  a  dia  trick |pg||
nt|idblu: these 5/5 hands come up frequently |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: and if north leads partner's suit, west wil be in fine shape|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|olson: most play 2n  as 16- 18   that hand is work  19.5 - 20 with the diamond length|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: right|pg||
pc|hT|nt|olson: E should  be forced  into  @D  returns  when on lead  as  she cannot attack clubs  with  a1098  in dummy|pg||
nt|olson: but N should want S  to play N  in case  West's  suit is spades|pg||
pc|h7|nt|idblu: but at that point the contract will be down|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|idblu: declarer looking for tricks in @D's|pg||

nt|olson: hi  all  |pg||
nt|idblu: will be disappointed on the next @D play|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|yo_yo: hi jeff|pg||
nt|othered1: so it's second from 3 small, but low from honor 3rd?|pg||
nt|olson: I would double  2d  and  double the  runout  to show  18+  any hand|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugrapha2: yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's what we play here in UK|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: according to the card|pg||
nt|olson: Easts other   suit could be  diamonds  |pg||
nt|vugrapha2: if u can, that's fine|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: but most play 2N lebensohl, so the @S stopper is random|pg||
pc|s3|nt|idblu: true|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h4|pg||
nt|olson: d 2  is  probable  now|pg||
pc|d8|nt|othered1: so west could have been taking a risk|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h6|nt|yo_yo: i am wondering how they got to 2"D|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: a puppet auction, sorry,|pg||
pc|c4|nt|olson: Y  but  there  is a chance  the 2n bidder  has a stopper,  no chance  N  has a spade stopper|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d3|nt|olson: the  h  9  is  the  worng play in  that suit  E  could have  J10  doubleton|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|s7|pg||

pc|hK|nt|othered1: puppet works just as well, if west can't go beyond 2@D without a 5-card major|pg||

nt|ralfwil: no @h ruff?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Exactly the wrong hand for an unusual nt in my opinion, but worked very well.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Maybe that's why they're playing and I'm watching.|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: Meanwhile EBU have passed the century deal|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a 50% 5@c will fail on a loosing @s finess|pg||
nt|eamongall: century imps total|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sharkirl: H plays well|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but there is a good @h contract on EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Very little actually|pg||

nt|eamongall: thats another poor effort by Walsh O Gorman ...the 30 point deck never came to light |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|garnetts: There is an issue with the alert system--sometimes it is a real alert and sometimes you do need to know|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@H seems enough here (or the equivalent)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: was P on N correct?|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: 2@D is more hearts...|pg||

nt|viren169: now 2N=clubs?|pg||
nt|viren169: are they in GF now? or can it be dropped at the 3@H level?|pg||
nt|granguru: 2@c looks like a @D transfer|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 1 off here as like as not|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: The lead suggests that 2@hs may have shown 2 suits such as @hs and a minor.|pg||
nt|granguru: so the lead is clear|pg||
mb|4S|nt|granguru: around 10 tricks|pg||
nt|granguru: @Dk to maintain the lead!|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: It is nat and Invite now... with 6 hearts...|pg||
nt|viren169: I am sure West will be pleased to see a diamond or two in dummy!|pg||
nt|granguru: and cross @cs|pg||
pc|h4|nt|garnetts: I think East should bid 3@D after 2NT--but then again I am old fashioned why let partner know you have short hearts and a six card suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Once again. the whole highway open...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|viren169: still only 8 tricks available...|pg||
nt|eamongall: there is argueably 11 tricks available |pg||

pc|hA|nt|garnetts: is it me or did a spade lead seem obvious here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but a careful play is needed. He doesn´t know that @hA is singleton|pg||

mb|p|nt|olson: yes  5@H X is not good on the EW cards in the OER|pg||
