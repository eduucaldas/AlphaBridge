nt|granguru: maximum contract|pg||
nt|granguru: well stopped|pg||
nt|starkist: hard to find the @c partial|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|garnetts: 4@S made in the OR and I cannot quite see how yet--unless they took the double spade finesse|pg||
nt|santyclz: As Kaplan used to say:  I have nothing against opening a (weak) nt with a 5-card suit, I just haven't come across the right hand yet.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|granguru: Now S needs only a stiff @H in N hand for 6@S|pg||
nt|granguru: wd|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Most now play 1M-2M as 7-10 with 3 card support|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|granguru: Was there a risk to duck|pg||
nt|granguru: ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: fair enough, but N wouldn't approve of S's @Cs!|pg||
nt|starkist: but s would approve on n's!|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: or there was a crash in @Ds|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|bobholl: and check back :)|pg||

nt|yo_yo: hello bumi|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: good biding so far, N might come in now with 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: can't imagine something else like wolff signoff|pg||
nt|april7: 3Nt should go down without a @D leadnd 4 @S also|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: otherwise NS are playing 0-2 NTs :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Adam now you get to see the other side of the vugraph,,,, Adam was an operator|pg||
nt|mariner1: during the Vanderbilt Cup|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: an impeccable Smolen auction|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, and in fact I was in the closed room with Elahmady and Sadek, who are also from Egypt :)|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, everyone!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: carefully right-siding the contract--diamond lead from N would beat 4S|pg||

nt|mrt2000: the bad news is the 5-0 @S break !|pg||
nt|granguru: still 6@s is on|pg||
nt|santyclz: Although lately she's deserted me to play with Richie Risig.  Can't imagine why.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|granguru: also 6@H|pg||

mb|3N|nt|viren169: another chance for E/W this time, to show their skill in the trump suit!|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Nice dummy!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: you are right !   6@S does not make|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|viren169: I would have lead a heart... |pg||
pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: a soft -1|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: If 2@d means a major, N must choose @h - NO!!!|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|granguru: it needs to be a trump coup to make 6@S..not sure it can be done|pg||
nt|garnetts: Even a heart elad dosn't help--it exposes North's trump queen--so this will always make|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

nt|bobholl: 4 @S in N is indeed better also with only 26 cards seen :)|pg||
nt|snorris: dont think so|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't believe it either|pg||
nt|april7: only 9 tricks in @S for W|pg||
nt|marlowepi: EW just scored a Smolen one|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 4@S might make without @H lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: not easy to take 2@H before one disappears on @C|pg||
nt|april7: true|pg||
nt|april7: but some people lead from Kings|pg||
nt|hussein2: not in egypt April :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is not a vuln multi in my opinion|pg||
nt|hussein2: Yousry is an agressive player, lets see what is he having in mind.|pg||
nt|april7: is this a 2@S opener vul.?|pg||
nt|bobholl: surely not vuln against not|pg||
nt|hussein2: I wouldn't, but maybe he would especially after finishing his juniors duty.|pg||
nt|april7: interesting bidding in hand 1 in oben room|pg||
mb|2D|an|multy|mb|p|nt|vugraphzkh: rare to pass with the S hand nowadays|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ady: yes   AK  A  and 5 card suit|pg||
nt|snorris: will west invite?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzkh: pretty rare in any age actually with 3quick trick|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a lucky slam here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkh: and a 7 loser hand|pg||
nt|ady: 3 spades already over the top|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i bet he does|pg||
nt|snorris: 9 hp, 5-5|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|bobholl: if you play 2way checkback he migth (2@C 2@D 2@H)|pg||

nt|snorris: yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is this team all male?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mariner1: btw all, put some Mozart, Brahms, Beethoven, or your favorite rock and enjoy|pg||
nt|mariner1: good bridge,,,,, life is great!|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 30 hcp, no great fit, they won't sniff at slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: no try|pg||
nt|snorris: I would have|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: now W will make 4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: nice lead |pg||
nt|bobholl: now migth make 4|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S used as big balanced hand here,,,,, could be others such as weak major|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D I mean|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@d is a multi type I guess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: depends, ed. "sniff at" has two meanings:  " flirt with " or "disdain"|pg||
nt|othered1: flirt with was my context|pg||
nt|marlowepi: my usual context also :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: maanged to climb to 4 sspades in other room|pg||
nt|snorris: yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we told him to make a try :)|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a bit odd|pg||

pc|h8|nt|snorris: probably not the way it vent|pg||
nt|yo_yo: however it doesnt look good to make 4 when you are only in 2|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it looks like W, who led spade ace, was imagining a spade holding like Kxx in declarer's hand and stiff queen in dummy, with E having an entry|pg||

mb|2C|nt|ralfwil: For better defence I can recommend Kelseys books Killing defence and more killing defence|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Tullamore dew aah Irish coffee (or shall it be Jameson?)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: spectators be warned and don't leave ...it has been indicated from the Western fringes of Ireland that board 21 is very interesting |pg||
mb|2D|nt|viren169: 3rd 4@S on the trot!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: He is my favourite author of bridge books|pg||
mb|2H|nt|santyclz: After Victor Mollo of course.|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 4@D is like a texas bid showing spades|pg||

nt|sharkirl: chance is gone|pg||
nt|eamongall: I don't see any way to 600 for north ireland |pg||
nt|sharkirl: 3nt only game chance|pg||
nt|eamongall: what strange bidding system is being used by n/s - psychs?   asks a spec|pg||
nt|eamongall: looks like premptive in @Ss or sacrifice in @Hs over 2@Ds multi |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|granguru: is the bidding right?|pg||
nt|granguru: probably w passed and N 3@S|pg||
nt|mrt2000: sounds right|pg||
nt|viren169: David, I hope you are making notes of all these conventions!|pg||
nt|garnetts: What conventions?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ralfwil: a penalty P on 3@sD had costed -4|pg||

nt|santyclz: This will pick up a couple of imps even if -1.|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|nt|garnetts: In view of the opening bid it is decent|pg||

nt|viren169: still need club hook!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|garnetts: So there was --I saw one in dummy only |pg||

nt|snorris: something rotten in ..|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a very possible layout|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Another monster for El-Mashad|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: unfortunately this one is misfitted|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: so 3NT looks like the best spot... making with 1 overtrick probably|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bobholl: no game on this one but how to stay out :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: a routine 3NT here|pg||
nt|april7: because of distribution 4 @S by N WILL MAKE|pg||
nt|mariner1: this could see fire works|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bobholl: what's rebid after 1@S ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 2@S|pg||
nt|bobholl: mine would be 2@S|pg||
mb|2N|nt|werge: About the 2 @S opening - nothing to say - I only comment on bridge...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: agree|pg||
nt|april7: 2NT now ans then ???|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 9@S lead might cause some problems    somewhat unlikely|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: raise off Kx might make life tricky though|pg||
mb|3C|nt|hussein2: Hi again!|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: We are back, yes|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 sp|pg||
nt|april7: 3@S???|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is 2NT artificial?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|hussein2: We have seen the action on the OR, apparently here there is a chance of avoiding game.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bobholl: inspired pass and gain 2|pg||
nt|werge: But how can North stay out of game..?|pg||
nt|hussein2: They pllay 2@h as one round forcing, so 3@h can be of a 10 HCP|pg||
nt|werge: 3 NT must be his bid!|pg||
nt|bobholl: well 3@C to Q doesn't help improve your cards|pg||
nt|werge: Sure - in NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 3 nt makes :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkh: hard to do when S was already passed though|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: unlikely to hold 6 cards in S|pg||
nt|snorris: yes q of @h onside|pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure I like the 2N here...... looks like 3@D to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: it may be artificial|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bobholl: he thougth probably that 3@H was forcing|pg||
nt|snorris: even better|pg||
nt|april7: @C lead and down you go, but @H lead  will make|pg||
nt|bobholl: no @C lead makes also with Q offside if a of @C rigth|pg||
nt|yo_yo: isnt 3NT cold on @C lead?|pg||
nt|april7: but also on @C lead |pg||
nt|mariner1: well using it as artificial should deny this much shape to me... sometimes you|pg||
nt|mariner1: need to tell as well as ask|pg||
pc|c2|nt|werge: All this game needs, is @H Queen onside, but not fourth or more|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably best to play D queen at trick 2|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|snorris: with a finesse|pg||
nt|yo_yo: depends on @H finesse |pg||
nt|april7: @H finesse is on|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|bobholl: 10 asking for @S ??|pg||

nt|henryb: as long as he dows not finesse the @d|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, the second heart honor was an error|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he should cash D ace. it is possible that the ten will fall, and then he can drive out the king. If only small cards appear, he can decide what to do then|pg||
nt|bobh1: fortunately for S, EW don't have many tricks to take|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|mariner1: well he still has some chance here due to suit breaks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bobholl: but obviously didn't forget it :)|pg||
pc|sT|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|h3|pg||

nt|mariner1: if he ducks a @D back does him in|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzkh: +1 now|pg||
nt|bobholl: he knew 6@C and 4@H so no chance|pg||

nt|bobholl: don't stayman with 4333|pg||
nt|hussein2: Well, 3nt bid looks resonable |pg||
nt|snorris: maybe they dont play 5 card Ms|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: and he might play for Qx @H too|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: A tool invented my Eric Rodwell, becasue he would bid with 3 card suits over his partner's 1m opening and he hated playing 3-3 fits|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|snorris: no 22hp slam this time|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: making 3 or 4, depending on if he finds the Q@H|pg||
pc|c3|nt|werge: For what reason, when I bid so, opponents take their 6-7 @S-trickc|pg||
nt|bobholl: in pairs you would have a very good score but here no difference|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|henryb: from the subsequent actions I would guess it was a transfer showing 4+ @h|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|henryb: If he tries to split the @h he could go down a lot|pg||

nt|eamongall: suppose its 6@Ds for EW|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ralfwil: Eamonn I think its because it´s the last one and you want everybody to watch all boards|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: Thanks to all especially the specs for correcting me!|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|viren169: E/W reached the dizzy height of 4@H in the other room!|pg||
nt|garnetts: There is a case for 2@C here by West|pg||

nt|viren169: and passing whtever response no doubt!|pg||
nt|eamongall: I am not going to do commentators curse|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: East is very optimistic after such a response|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|ralfwil: And after Ps 2@c?|pg||

mb|p|nt|starkist: 5@C was good save|pg||
mb|p|nt|starkist: going to make a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: who's doing the thinking here?|pg||
nt|granguru: In fact with a @d lead it also can be made|pg||
pc|s9|nt|garnetts: You can bid 2@H over 2@D and expect partner to bid 2@S with three spades and two hearts|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|granguru: it is very against probabilities thou|pg||
nt|viren169: and with a 45xx shape?|pg||
nt|viren169: I would prefer pd to pass 2@H on that seq...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|santyclz: Perfect trumps for a high x-ruff, difficult with 4333 however.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: to avoid a crossruff in the defence, he must clean trumps|pg||
nt|eamongall: however Ireland finish with a win ...finishing with a win is good to quote rory boland |pg||
nt|eamongall: 17-13 victory to Ireland|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|garnetts: AS Peter Goodman has argued that with the odd shapes that are opened 1NT these days it has risk attached |pg||

pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|viren169: True... best to pass 2@D and take your chances!|pg||
nt|garnetts: You may be amazed to know I prefer to open 1NT with a balanced hand which excludes most 5-4-2-2 shapes and 6-3-2-2 shapes as well|pg||
nt|viren169: worse hand 3325 shape|pg||

nt|eamongall: :):)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: NS fairly natural, EW strong club|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and a save in @s will cost 800 witn an optimal defence|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|viren169: 1N by North assuming 1@D may be short?|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|granguru: would you bid  2@C?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: but can you show the strength? |pg||

pc|s4|nt|granguru: well - when playing ghestem michaels copenhagen or any other....normally you have an opportunity to show the great hand by bidding again|pg||

pc|sA|pg||

nt|garnetts: I think my oppo should be made to use it|pg||
nt|viren169: playing for high stakes no doubt!|pg||
nt|garnetts: it works especially badly if playing 2/1 because it does not allow you develop middle range hands with a decent six card suit|pg||

pc|s7|nt|granguru: but hard that the defense get all their tricks|pg||

pc|s9|nt|viren169: Yes that is true... most pairs have not discussed what dbl means in any depth? |pg||
nt|garnetts: It also is yet another thing to remember which clogs the brain for card play |pg||
nt|viren169: I agree... we need more books on card play rather than systems!|pg||

nt|garnetts: 3@D shows shortage|pg||
nt|viren169: 3D is shortage agreeing spades|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mdgraham: even 5@S can go down with the diamond ruff, which would be a bit unlucky|pg||
nt|viren169: maybe showing a void... there are other ways to show a singleton|pg||
nt|garnetts: I slso hope it shows a void not a singleton--there is an enormous qualitative difference|pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably a correct desicion from W|pg||

nt|ralfwil: My bid is to help partner not overturn|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: -2 if a good @D guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Crucial when playing splinters that it shows a singlton not a void|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@C is a bit of an overbid... with wasted values in diamonds|pg||
nt|eamongall: through grinding teeth|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: 2@c was forcing to game|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
nt|garnetts: Depends upon agreements but splinters should also have specified working values|pg||
nt|viren169: Well stopped... 4@S is high enough!|pg||
nt|granguru: unless a @S lead in which case you win 3N|pg||
nt|granguru: Here you might earn 6D|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|viren169: not the best start for defense... not sure there is a good lead.|pg||
nt|garnetts: club feels OK--might have led a trump--but not when I can see all hands|pg||
nt|viren169: the fact a heart was not led, should help declarer to get the heart position right later in the play.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: N was expecting E to correct to s[pades|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: light opener by east    |pg||
pc|d2|nt|mariner1: you know S has short @H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would certainly bid 3D with the N hand|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: probably... so if South cannot bid, often 2@H is the best place|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but you have no way of knowing that S has shoprt hearts|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c4|nt|henryb: seems normal|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mtvesuvius: however I think 3@d seems best with the N hand |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h8|nt|henryb: the two pairs in this match are the only ones to open a 1 bid. one player opened 2@h in E!!!!!!!!!|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't "know" that south has short @H at tht point.  Perhaps to the contrary |pg||
nt|mariner1: btw a good on line hand evaluator http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N only learns that S has short hearts when it is no longer his turn to bid|pg||

mb|1S|nt|granguru: those things still happen these days|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: It has been scored as minus one  12 imp loss for WALES|pg||

nt|viren169: seems strange play!|pg||

nt|mariner1: 15 opposite 14 with no fits|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: that's my 4@S !|pg||
nt|april7: could be , but 4@S for sure going 2 down, but NS might go to 5@H|pg||
nt|snorris: hoping for a pass in north..|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess on last hand, north was hoping 2@S would come back to him (not 3 or 4) and he'd then be able to double -- and perhaps bid game by himself?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: 7 diamonds ambition   need to negotiate the clubs|pg||
nt|bobholl: depends on your style if you open with 11-12 balanced|pg||
nt|werge: North has a lot of intermedias, so 3 NT directe is a good shot - on a @H-lead|pg||
nt|werge: - og, he allready did, good connection - Denmark-Egypt|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: ambitious|pg||

nt|werge: Yes - he can´t handle Q 9 x x ist East - but in West|pg||
nt|snorris: well it came out good for e-w|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, they are finding ways to generate swings on some of them...|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: that is true :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: well we are back to a 5 imp set|pg||

mb|p|nt|granguru: kind of @S6R  meaning that a revoke was made playing the @S6...this card should turn red when displayed at the screen|pg||

nt|viren169: East has pushed the boat out too far...|pg||
nt|viren169: I assume 2@D was spme sort of opening with 6+ diamonds?|pg||
nt|viren169: No need for East to bid? Was there?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not really Gad--South would have bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: If 21D was passed to him|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@D |pg||
nt|viren169: Yes on this hand... odds are that the opps dont have the values to come in?!?!|pg||
nt|garnetts: NS can make 130 in clubs |pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|ralfwil: I don´t like this doubles! Act immediately and not now! What will he do after 3@c?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: S would have been under pressure on the run of the @Cs|pg||
nt|eamongall: 4@S-1 is a sad effort by Walsh O'gorman |pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: another way to treat with this things is that the revoking player receives an electroshock when card is taken out of his deck|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: :)|pg||
nt|granguru: 2@S is a little better contract than 2@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|granguru: eventually you have more control with a 5-2 than a 4-3 trump distirbution|pg||
nt|viren169: Ummmmm, I think 2@D has taken clubs out of the auction!|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@D has the potential to entice an injudicious North|pg||
nt|santyclz: I first became acquainted with this not being a penalty x when I was holding aqj10xx of the suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: unusual treatment here, to have 2@H nf  |pg||

nt|granguru: @Dk to maintain the lead!|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|mrt2000: 11 now, perhaps|pg||
mb|6D|nt|viren169: It is nat and Invite now... with 6 hearts...|pg||
nt|viren169: I am sure West will be pleased to see a diamond or two in dummy!|pg||
nt|granguru: and cross @cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I think East should bid 3@D after 2NT--but then again I am old fashioned why let partner know you have short hearts and a six card suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Once again. the whole highway open...|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: still only 8 tricks available...|pg||
nt|eamongall: there is argueably 11 tricks available |pg||
nt|eamongall: @H and @S to lose|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: is it me or did a spade lead seem obvious here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but a careful play is needed. He doesn´t know that @hA is singleton|pg||
nt|sharkirl: need  to play H or S immed|pg||
pc|cA|nt|granguru: btw the revoke cost 4 imps t oNI|pg||
pc|c4|nt|granguru: mmmm|pg||
nt|eamongall: sorry I just looked at the losers ....|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||

pc|d3|nt|granguru: and maintained his @d entry|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|granguru: to give e 2 ruffs!|pg||
nt|mrt2000: but could still take tha @DA before the second @C, as he has a @S entry|pg||
nt|granguru: I suppose you wrote that before you read mi last line|pg||

nt|mariner1: well in a 2 imp match I do :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: we did change leaders again|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: A very shaky 6@d in the OR|pg||
mb|1D|nt|me argent: true but being able to start low would have helped|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: i doubt wheather they will stop in time now |pg||
nt|snorris: 1 @s-2@s?|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board of the session........... next in 75 minutes|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: spec asked do Holland & Brunner play 1 club 16+|pg||

mb|p|nt|april7: y and then 4 |pg||
nt|marlowepi: this does not look like a challenging call|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|mariner1: getting to slam on these cards is not that easy to see|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S seems right|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|snorris: well.. not allways..|pg||
mb|p|nt|thedoc: no they play standard Acol|pg||
nt|ady: thx|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: Hard to find rare r"red" saves at the 5 level I suppose|pg||
nt|thedoc: indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk3: A lot of if's, but if EBU can hold on to a lead around 40 (21-9), England must win the second half by 50 IMPs against Wales to win the Camrose Trophy. So EBU in a very strong ...|pg||
nt|Walddk3: position at this point|pg||
nt|werge: Here is real play for 6 §D - if you guess well|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: They are 45 up against Scotland|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: although this 4@H I think isn't cold|pg||
nt|werge: 6 @d|pg||
nt|bobholl: than E will not stop i think with the nice @H k|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|bobholl: if you guess the @H j (and you can do it 2 ways:)|pg||
nt|april7: ofcourse not,its a too weak hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|werge: With the lead, slam is cold|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|april7: N's X is also a bad one|pg||
nt|mariner1: new leader|pg||
nt|bobh1: W stuck in a 2@c call sooner rather than later, which made the auction a little dicier|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|bobh1: 2@c over 1@d has a way of gumming up the works|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, slam is not just miniscule percentage, but it is also hard to imagine a plausible sequence that would get NS there|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|mtvesuvius: NS in the OR found one though|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|snorris: very bad|pg||
nt|mariner1: and N took without a "How good is your hand" type call over the 3@S forced|pg||
nt|bobh1: why W thinks its better to bid 3@c later rather than 2@c immediately is a mystery|pg||
nt|mariner1: took OFF|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Slam needs to pick up the KT@S and the Q@D and the A@C onside... Not a good slam unless you are down a lot in a match|pg||

nt|granguru: y|pg||
nt|mrt2000: N couldn't handle to @S successfully|pg||
mb|1C|nt|garnetts: A demonstration of why leads matter --a spade and dec has no play |pg||
nt|santyclz: X or whatever shows the majors?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|viren169: good lead problem!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|garnetts: 1@S?  |pg||
mb|3D|nt|viren169: N/S may lose their heart fit now...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Probably lebensohl.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|granguru: except that it is played by West|pg||
nt|viren169: 1@S denies spades I guess|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|granguru: As it will here|pg||
mb|4D|nt|viren169: and 1N probably show spades... to right side the NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: That is an example of what I mean by an alert being necessary|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As I play I can show a 1-card major (defined) and another 4-card suit, so we can find our 5-4 in @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: A @D lead beats 4@H |pg||
nt|viren169: North has done well to introduce hearts!|pg||
nt|granguru: this contract will probably fail|pg||
nt|eamongall: EBU vouchers are great ... you can buy bridge books from Brian Senior |pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: a @D lead could  help declarer a lot|pg||
nt|mrt2000: it will make on a red suit lead|pg||
pc|hT|nt|garnetts: well done North |pg||
pc|h4|nt|granguru: but the defense opened @Hs ...establishing 3 defensive tricks |pg||

nt|bobholl: but NS have a good save available in 6@S|pg||
nt|werge: 800, |pg||
nt|april7: a much better hand to open by W|pg||
nt|mariner1: if you FORCE a partner to bid its usually best to then ask if he has a good hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Not good even then.   |pg||
nt|marlowepi: even then it is a terrible slam. there have to be better opportunities. like hope your opponents bid it, thinking that you will|pg||
nt|mariner1: now the last board of this session....... plenty to score though|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|werge: After 2 @S, the eventuel @H-guess is 100 %|pg||

nt|bobholl: i would open the west hand always (may be not in 4th)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|nt|ady: 2H about limite    East will likely to bid to 3@D   one too high on a spade lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: a big THANKS! to Unknown (Egypt), our superb operator, for doing an excellent|pg||
nt|mariner1: job!!!|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bobh1: is this a support x?|pg||

nt|mariner1: sponsors and organizers for helping BBO bring us the vugraphs!|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: are you trusting your partner or opponents ?|pg||
nt|werge: Pass here is invitation from West|pg||
nt|bobholl: if partner invites and i have AKQ of trumps ??|pg||
nt|april7: E should bid 6@D after 5@C by W, where does W take this bid if not very strong and distributional, which he is only distributional|pg||
nt|bobholl: but what if we miss AK of @H ??|pg||
nt|werge: Then West had doubled!|pg||
nt|april7: can't be  missing 2 aces|pg||

mb|p|pc|sA|nt|mariner1: and thanks for their wit and insight to my co-commentators  Bob Heitzman, Adam|pg||

nt|mariner1: Khalil (Egypt), and Roland Wald (Denmark).....I am Rob Brown (USA)........|pg||

pc|s2|nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at|pg||
nt|mariner1: it!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|april7: so W has only AK of @C??:):)|pg||
nt|werge: East knows, that partners opening bid is based og 17 HCP in @H and @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: now @H lead so no problems :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: who bid 6@S W or N ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: even without the @D J culbertson 21/2 honour trick :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|werge: undo pls|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bobholl: thats good insurance :)|pg||
