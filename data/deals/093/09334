mb|2S|mb|d|nt|kareno: Weak two with a secret weapon by north.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|finch: There are two approaches with North's hand - open a weak two and hope to bid again, or pass and try to come in later|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@d most likely shows values.  Lebensohl.|pg||
nt|athene: he might decide discretion is the better part of his rebid here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|athene: with E-W announcing lots of values (3@D lebensohl) and E having hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|finch: 2@S is undercooking the hand slightly, but after the takeout double and value-showing 3@D bid it's asking for trouble to bid again|pg||
nt|kareno: I imagine he had in mind to bid again when he opened but now discretion is the better part of valor.|pg||
nt|chick: and after the 3@H bid, I'm sure he's happy he didn't :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room Elahmady opened a Polish 2@H, 5-5 in hearts and any other, and Gitelman jumped to 3NT|pg||
nt|kareno: And this game will come in easily with the diamond suit showing up for four tricks and the rest also nicely situated for declarer.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Rob :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Steve rather|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: This is not Howard, Patty|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, interestingly the board shows Howard.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: Steve Weinstein|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: with AKJx / xxx (or the equivalent) it's normal to cash the tops first before leading to the jack|pg||
nt|athene: if you can afford to lose the lead and are just trying to maximise the chance of 3 tricks|pg||
nt|kareno: Steve Weinstein (no relation) is also a wonderful player.  I'd take either of them :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: uh oh, Fred bid 4NT over 4@C and is now raised to 5NT|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|kareno: I was puzzled to see Howard's name frankly because I know Steve and Bobby have a partnership.  But the bridge world is full of changes every year :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't really make 12 tricks. Perhaps 11 by endplaying North|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am talking about board 33 in the closed room|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: the way bbo now works is if you right click and input a name, it automatically fills in the particulars|pg||
nt|kareno: Eleven is the most I can see.  I don't think north gets into trouble in the minors.|pg||
nt|mariner1: will they push here to 3N ? on 13 opposite 10?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: had to guess whether just Weinstein would bring up the H or the S... thanks for the nudges|pg||
nt|mariner1: Meckwell often do......|pg||
nt|finch: There are some 10-counts worth an invite, but the East hand here looks like a pass|pg||
nt|athene: East has a club fit; he doesn't realise that West doesn't :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Ten opposite a maximum of 14 and not vul, I don't think so.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: but i think even with five decent clubs it's still a pass|pg||
nt|kareno: Vulnerable I might raise.  Might.|pg||
nt|chick: 1N showed a balanced hand, so E may suspect the clubs aren't that good|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|athene: there are three schools of thought as to whether West should show the spades:- a) always  b) never, show your overall hand type with 1nt  c) show unless 4333|pg||

mb|2C|an|STR ART F|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|athene: miraculous layout in the minors means 7nt rolls, but of course isn't biddable without the help of many martinis|pg||
nt|kareno: But lacking in distribution.  However, six clubs can be made because two finesses work.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|finch: I anticipate a final contract of 3NT, reached fairly soon|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Oh, thirteen tricks with the diamonds coming down.  Not a good slam but one that has the important quality of making.|pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: stevie claimed 11 then platnick said: "but it's QJ singleton of @Ds"|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kareno: Simply put you never put your contract at risk when you see a clear route to making it.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|athene: there is also the slight problem that you want to put in the @HJ or @H10 to entice a cover, but if it isn't covered that makes overtaking with the ace and finessing riskier|pg||
nt|mariner1: this makes @S slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|mariner1: not sure anyone could bid it, or should|pg||
nt|athene: West has a very strong hand facing 5+ spades (which i assume 1@S showed)|pg||
nt|mariner1: even with @c @c lead and ruff the @D setup|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, a thin one on high card values but definitely good - and it makes.  3@s is a good bid.|pg||
nt|athene: South certainly might have raised hearts|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he just decided his side wasn't winning this auction, so why give information?|pg||
nt|finch: slam is not very good after two rounds of clubs|pg||
nt|kareno: Sometimes with a fit it's best not to raise and make it clear to the opponents that their distribution is working for them.  |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|mariner1: slam still makes as the @D come in anyway if play for drop|pg||
nt|athene: well, even if hearts are raised, both East and West have the wrong number of hearts|pg||
nt|athene: in situations where your opps show a 9-card fit you want one or three, not two|pg||
nt|kareno: It relies at that point on 3-2 diamonds (or queen coming singleton) and 3-1 trumps at worst.  Who has the slide rule?|pg||
nt|finch: admittedly they have to start with the @CK to force this properly, on a low club lead the clubs are set up|pg||
nt|kareno: 5@c will be music to Levin's ears.|pg||
nt|mariner1: well its less than 50%|pg||
nt|chick: and with the sole NS bid in N, he may take a diamond finesse the losing way|pg||
nt|athene: West is worried about the threatbare diamonds but really he has everything else - club control, great trumps...he has to push beyond game now|pg||
nt|kareno: The man with the slide rule says it's about 62 percent.  Thanks :)|pg||
nt|athene: threaDbare diamonds sorry|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|mariner1: did slideruler include 4 - 0 @S? and 4 - 1 and 5 - 0 @D?|pg||
nt|kareno: Now 5@d by east.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6S|nt|kareno: As west you have to know your partner has a great hand.  He is making slam tries without great trumps.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: with spades 2-2 you are making if diamonds are 4-1|pg||
nt|chick: in case anyone is wondering, it's not N and S hesitating over their passes ... the operator can't enter the N bid until E has also bid, and ditto for S-W|pg||
nt|athene: west doesn't need much but @DK, @HA and a bit of a spade suit from partner for this to have play|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: I now leave you in the capable hands of Shannon Cappalletti, enjoy all!!!!|pg||
nt|kareno: Bye and thank you!!|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Shannon!|pg||
nt|mariner1: ty :)|pg||
nt|kareno: And hi to Shannon :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: hi :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kareno: So now declarer must get trumps out and hope for a good diamond break which he gets.|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps just two rounds of trumps, then go to diamonds|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|nt|athene: ruff third round high, return to dummy with third trump|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: basically just needs 3-2 diamonds|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kareno: Yes, that's just fine.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: of course the @DQ appears so that helps things along|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kareno: Obviously he needs to leave a trump entry to dummy.  Can't afford to use four rounds of trumps.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|kareno: So often that ninth trump is the key to a slam.  This is only one example of the importance of that holding.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|finch: South may have thought about leading a club; he has so many hearts it's quite likely he isn't setting a trick up|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: it's not only an extra trump you've got, it's one they haven't got|pg||

nt|mariner1: yes nicely done|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kareno: 4@s on n/s.|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, yes,. it's pointed out that a club ruff can be negotiated on defense.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: awkward hand for east; you might double 1@S if playing 'equal level conversion'|pg||
nt|athene: the problem comes when south bids quite a lot of spades and partner bids quite a lot of clubs|pg||
mb|3N!|an|random stiff, min GF|mb|p|nt|athene: for anyone unfamiliar with that treatment:- Equal Level Conversion means you can double with an offshape hand and correct partner's unwelcome response without showing extras|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: so for example there if east doubled and partner rudely bid 2@C he could bid 2@D without showing a big hand|pg||
nt|kareno: 3nt obviously some sort of spade raise. |pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N is a nice gimic for this hand|pg||
nt|finch: ELC is one thing, but an 11-count with3 low spades is going a bit far|pg||
nt|athene: well i am not saying there was anything wrong with pass|pg||
nt|athene: certainly @Sxxx suggests pass|pg||
nt|athene: the Poles (and maybe others) use a gadget for precisely that East hand type - a 1nt overcall to show 5minor 4major|pg||
nt|mariner1: E must be thinking|pg||
nt|kareno: Light overcall is about as much as I would consider over 1@s with that east hand.  ELC is for more shapely hands.|pg||
nt|kareno: IMO|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Levin asking about the 4nt bid, it guarantees 4 trumps|pg||
mb|4N|nt|kareno: N/S play forcing club so their opening bids can be quite light.|pg||
nt|finch: south doesn't have to be that light.  I think South is going to start showing the red cards|pg||
nt|kareno: The north hand fits the popular 'rule of 20,' where if you are deciding whether to open a light hand you count your points and the lengths of your two long suite and if they get to ...|pg||
nt|kareno: 20 it is an optional opening bid.|pg||
nt|mariner1: down 500 in 5@D DBL I think|pg||
nt|finch: having QJ1097 rather than QJ432 doesn't hurt either|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|kareno: Levin coming in hoping to strike gold with one of his suits - at favorable vulnerability.|pg||
nt|kareno: We know that it is a phantom save but he doesn't.|pg||
nt|athene: Levin decided his partner had a small singleton or void spade|pg||
mb|5S|nt|kareno: Hopefully west won't give preference to hearts with his equal holdings.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: slightly odd that South didn't double looking at so much defensive stuff|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, the operation was a success!!|pg||
nt|mariner1: saved by another phantom|pg||
nt|finch: would have stopped partner bidding 5@S|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, south certainly could have saved the day for n/s with a smart double.|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Stragely enough the only game that makes for N-S is 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: double of 4NT should perhaps say something about where his singleton is?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: althought i doubt they have any such agreements|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think S might have hit the 4N....|pg||
nt|finch: just another flat board|pg||
nt|kareno: mmm.. I think it would just be indicative of a desire to punish them.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|kareno: LOL Frances|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: well, you have shown your hand so precisely, that the most useful information you can give partner in competition is surely where your singleton is|pg||

nt|mariner1: I am with you William|pg||
nt|finch: partner will work it out when I don't double one of their suits|pg||
pc|s2|mc|10|nt|chick: that's true, but it's also valuable to just say you prefer to defend|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|finch: NS will need to lead diamonds reasonably early in the defence to beat this, or declarer can just keep playing trumps|pg||

nt|finch: always hardest to compete when the opponents are in a 7-card fit with our trumps breaking 3-3|pg||

mb|3D|nt|finch: ruffing @s finesse if they don't lead @d|pg||
nt|kareno: How better than a finesse?|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes|pg||
nt|athene: it might seem aggressive to make a vulnerable 3-level overcall with only a 5-card suit, but when opps have showed a big major fit, it's relatively safe to get a lead bid in|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes|pg||
nt|athene: they aren't too anxious to double you|pg||
nt|chick: especially vul|pg||
mb|p!|nt|kareno: On this hand, yes.  Wouldn't expect that holding though.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: there was an alert on the N pass - some discussion between Levin and Platnick|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: I believe Platnick said that the pass shows a minimum hand|pg||
mb|5D|nt|chick: that's certainly what he has|pg||
nt|mariner1: the 30 - 2 this session is getting into serious territory...... though not infrangible........|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The question is whether it's a minimum hand when you have five controls|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Still only three swings.|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Also bear in mind that they play a big club system|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: still only 3 tricks and a lot of losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: If south pulls the double that would show extra offensive values.  |pg||
pc|sK|nt|kareno: He passed and accepted partner's decision.  |pg||
nt|mariner1: well saved from the non-maker "maybe"|pg||
nt|mariner1: would NS have bid the slam if no 5@D call?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kareno: 5@d down two with the club onside for declarer.|pg||

nt|athene: they might play 6@D?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|an|not forcing|nt|athene: east has a pretty nice hand facing a strong minor 2-suiter|pg||
nt|athene: but perhaps not quite strong enough - would just love a fourth diamond|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, but only a three-card fit.  eight trumps.  We'll see.|pg||
nt|finch: 6@D needs quite a bit of work, you have to do something with the clubs without losing too many trump tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: give me AK987 opposite QJ10 and I'd like to be in 6@D|pg||

mb|4S|an|cue|nt|athene: but it's not really possible for east to be bidding so strongly without a heart control is it?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|an|blackwood|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@SX down 6 with perfect defence, says Mike Passell|pg||
mb|5D|an|0 or 3|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i don't see that declarer will make this without peeking at north's diamond holding|pg||
nt|kareno: It is a very tough slam to make.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: all explanations given by weinstein|pg||
nt|kareno: The one-spade overcall marks north with values outside of spades.  |pg||
nt|finch: it's not making on the lie.  6NT is, however only deep finesse would bid it|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|finch: The play is likely to take quite a long time, however|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Closed Q@S lead, AK @c  ruff @c  over ruff J@D back,,,,, thinking for 5 minutes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then it's makeable if you know they layout|pg||
nt|athene: now he might ruff @C high and finesse?|pg||

nt|mariner1: 6N would make give up a @c and S in red suit squeeze.... as Frances said|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very tough at the table|pg||
nt|chick: switching to heart right into the visible AQ seems a little nuts|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamond return is alluring.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: Brilliant!|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, low diamond better than jack if returning trump.|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks unmakeable from here.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree that a low diamond would almost always succeed, but this is 100%|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And I compliment Diamond for finding it|pg||
nt|athene: declarer is just short of one entry for the trump coup now|pg||
nt|kareno: Can he coup south?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some specs think he can still coup. I disagree|pg||
nt|kareno: No coup possible - not enough entries to the board and south can split at the right moment.|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. @SA pitching @C, spade ruff, @C ruffed high, spade ruff, heart to @HA|pg||
nt|athene: but now south just splits|pg||
nt|kareno: In the closed room, south split voluntarily.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|kareno: By leading diamond back.|pg||
nt|athene: you have @DAK9 over him but no more entries|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: I am getting loads of messages about how he can make it from here. I am sorry, I still disagree|pg||
nt|athene: he can't make it|pg||
nt|chick: he can't now|pg||
nt|kareno: He cannot make it here unless south falls off the chair.|pg||
nt|chick: unless S makes a mistake|pg||
nt|mariner1: ruff in S here would give it to him|pg||
nt|athene: if south ruffed here you could just overruff, ruff @C high and draw trumps|pg||
nt|kareno: We as commentators do NOT use GIB.  GIB knows where all the cards are - that is not useful when you are sharing the analysis with great declarers.|pg||
nt|kareno: If south ruffs here it will count as a terrible error.|pg||
nt|finch: when South discards here, he ruffs low, cross on a heart, ruff another spade low, cash a top diamond, ruff a club high|pg||
nt|athene: although of course you might still go wrong - you still have to finesse trumps|pg||
nt|mariner1: very true Karen|pg||
nt|finch: making if North has singleton J or 10 of diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We also know where all the cards are, and we can see that he can't make it if Diamond discards|pg||
nt|athene: he will be wondering why south didn't switch to a trump after over-ruffing|pg||
nt|athene: but he will discount the actual layout, as he can't ever succeed against that|pg||
nt|finch: he knows South has at least 4 diamonds, because he has only 4 black cards and North has two+ hearts|pg||
nt|finch: the only layout that he can make on is singleton diamond honour with North, so that is what he is playing for|pg||
nt|finch: while South just needs to think through the hand sufficiently to be sure he can beat it|pg||
nt|kareno: For south this could be (tell me if I am wrong) the most important match he has ever played and he does not want to make an error.|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am "guessing" a 15 minute break after board 48 and then we will do the last 16|pg||

nt|mariner1: do bridge games come with Pullman Options?|pg||

pc|cK|nt|chick: Diamond has closed the gap to 17 imps now, so the match is still quite a contest|pg||
nt|kareno: There are sixteen more boards to watch in this close and exciting match.  What great bridge we've all seen here today.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kareno: Split and one out of two finesses.  Good game to bid and make.  Will be a push or perhaps an IMP to Diamond.|pg||
nt|kareno: Heart first and it may provide a pitch for a spade.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: diamond asked what 2D opening is, and EW play Flannery|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||

nt|kareno: Looks like it's necessary to make the hand.|pg||
nt|athene: after his agonies with diamond finesses last hand, he has another decision right away|pg||
