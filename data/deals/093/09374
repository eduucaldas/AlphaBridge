pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|garnetts: 4@S made in the OR and I cannot quite see how yet--unless they took the double spade finesse|pg||
nt|santyclz: As Kaplan used to say:  I have nothing against opening a (weak) nt with a 5-card suit, I just haven't come across the right hand yet.|pg||

nt|bobholl: Q off @S would have been easier :)|pg||
nt|werge: Both games can make with North as declarer - just putting your money on the @H Queen|pg||
nt|bobholl: but now doesn't need @C finesse anymore|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If 2@d means a major, N must choose @h - NO!!!|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|granguru: it needs to be a trump coup to make 6@S..not sure it can be done|pg||
nt|garnetts: Even a heart elad dosn't help--it exposes North's trump queen--so this will always make|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||

nt|marlowepi: EW just scored a Smolen one|pg||
nt|bobholl: in imps it happens less frequentially which is strange :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: Dagher  must be a beer card exponent the way he played the @D suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
mb|1C|nt|april7: 4@S might make without @H lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: not easy to take 2@H before one disappears on @C|pg||
nt|april7: true|pg||
nt|april7: but some people lead from Kings|pg||
nt|hussein2: not in egypt April :)|pg||

nt|april7: is this a 2@S opener vul.?|pg||
nt|bobholl: surely not vuln against not|pg||
nt|hussein2: I wouldn't, but maybe he would especially after finishing his juniors duty.|pg||
nt|april7: interesting bidding in hand 1 in oben room|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|vugraphzkh: rare to pass with the S hand nowadays|pg||

nt|marlowepi: a lucky slam here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkh: and a 7 loser hand|pg||

nt|snorris: 9 hp, 5-5|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, 2@S greater that 2@D :)|pg||

nt|mariner1: 2@S used as big balanced hand here,,,,, could be others such as weak major|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D I mean|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@d is a multi type I guess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: depends, ed. "sniff at" has two meanings:  " flirt with " or "disdain"|pg||
nt|othered1: flirt with was my context|pg||
nt|marlowepi: my usual context also :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: maanged to climb to 4 sspades in other room|pg||

nt|snorris: probably not the way it vent|pg||
nt|yo_yo: however it doesnt look good to make 4 when you are only in 2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: it looks like W, who led spade ace, was imagining a spade holding like Kxx in declarer's hand and stiff queen in dummy, with E having an entry|pg||

nt|marlowepi: no aces, no heart card, one measly D stopper.......i wouldnt bid 2NT even facing Al Roth|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bobholl: 3 nt makes :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzkh: hard to do when S was already passed though|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: unlikely to hold 6 cards in S|pg||
nt|snorris: yes q of @h onside|pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure I like the 2N here...... looks like 3@D to me|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it may be artificial|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bobholl: he thougth probably that 3@H was forcing|pg||
nt|snorris: even better|pg||
nt|april7: @C lead and down you go, but @H lead  will make|pg||
nt|bobholl: no @C lead makes also with Q offside if a of @C rigth|pg||
nt|yo_yo: isnt 3NT cold on @C lead?|pg||
nt|april7: but also on @C lead |pg||
nt|mariner1: well using it as artificial should deny this much shape to me... sometimes you|pg||
nt|mariner1: need to tell as well as ask|pg||
pc|d8|nt|werge: All this game needs, is @H Queen onside, but not fourth or more|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably best to play D queen at trick 2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|snorris: with a finesse|pg||
nt|yo_yo: depends on @H finesse |pg||
nt|april7: @H finesse is on|pg||

pc|c8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|bobholl: 10 asking for @S ??|pg||
nt|werge: - and we talk about a man having 6-cards @C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it all depends on what your agreements are|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice line|pg||
nt|bridge_one: depending on agreements - may be they use 2Nt not minimum hand|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ?? all the more reason not to bid it then|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|bobholl: we can see that it makes no difference but he migth be stressed now :)|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s5|nt|mariner1: now he has a entry issue, needed to continue @D|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|henryb: ty Roland|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: good evening Henry|pg||

nt|ady: may|pg||
nt|henryb: as long as he dows not finesse the @d|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, the second heart honor was an error|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he should cash D ace. it is possible that the ten will fall, and then he can drive out the king. If only small cards appear, he can decide what to do then|pg||
nt|bobh1: fortunately for S, EW don't have many tricks to take|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h2|nt|mariner1: well he still has some chance here due to suit breaks|pg||
nt|sybarra: seem to be in a rut here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobholl: but obviously didn't forget it :)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|bobholl: he should have dumped 10 of @S to have a chance|pg||
pc|d2|pc|sT|nt|ady: cant understand the spade play    would Holland lead Q@S from KQJ9X|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|hussein2: He must be thinking of a trump coup. Dont think it workes in this layout.|pg||
nt|mariner1: if he ducks a @D back does him in|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H +110 with spade guess|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzkh: +1 now|pg||
nt|bobholl: he knew 6@C and 4@H so no chance|pg||

nt|snorris: we have a slam!|pg||
nt|bobholl: even +3 with 2 aces missing :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: sure as Marshall said, do not remove @H cards until @D are setup|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tricky for S after 1D-P-1H|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H here on finding the Q@H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 2 slam|pg||
nt|bobholl: slam in @H or @D on @S finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: well not what, can make 6 @H or 6 @D |pg||
mb|p|nt|hussein2: cold 4@H here|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|werge: Here less than 11 tricks in @H is impossible|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would bid 2C, but other calls could win|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I would imagine EW will stop in 3@h|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|snorris: 3 @d as a fit bid?|pg||
nt|snorris: no..|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they will just get to game|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mtvesuvius: X = 3@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: support X|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3C now by E|pg||
nt|bobh1: at imps, E will prob drive to 4@h|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 3@C would be my call, game try|pg||
nt|bobh1: at mps, more delicacy might be indicated|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but he should check for playbility of 3NT first|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: double finesse in @S :) 10 tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be 2@D is already 7-9 (i play that too)|pg||
mb|2C|an| |nt|werge: @H...?|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't stayman with 4333|pg||
nt|hussein2: Well, 3nt bid looks resonable |pg||
nt|snorris: maybe they dont play 5 card Ms|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: and he might play for Qx @H too|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: A tool invented my Eric Rodwell, becasue he would bid with 3 card suits over his partner's 1m opening and he hated playing 3-3 fits|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 or 3@H now ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think any finesses are needed|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes 12+tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: true 6+6 =12|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|snorris: no 22hp slam this time|pg||
nt|frankaus: i likr the 4th suit (GF) here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now i think they will call slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: cash A of @C of dont get it |pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome frank|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: 3 spades made in other room though appears one too high|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: curious|pg||
nt|henryb: was double a transfer to @h or negative?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkh: no explanation asked or given|pg||
nt|bobholl: doesn't know about single @C (yet)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|april7: so little losers in E'S hand, so might try for slam except 2 @D isa weak raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|hussein2: at least he assures the 11 tricks now |pg||
nt|bridge_one: and in IMP to play @D instead @H isn't a big lose|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|bobholl: now he could know|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now singleton in @C in North is read|pg||
nt|sybarra: he might get the drift of the delicate auction |pg||
nt|bobholl: but not quite sure :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: 5@H OUT convention - here helps|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however 5@D is a good choose now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N should rebid 4C over 3H. that has to be a club control with either a heart tolerance or a slammish hand in diamonds. but if N simply bids 2D over 2C, S will get to tell his whole ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: story|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has not shown short clubs. he could easily have a stiff heart honor and two losing clubs|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5 @H migth be in danger only looking at S card :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|frankaus: OUT bid 6 if can hold (O)pponents , (U)nbid or (T)rump suit to one loser|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could push N to slam now |pg||
nt|frankaus: in that order|pg||
nt|marlowepi: automatic for N to bid slam now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q in @H can't be - so 5@D (a differite raise) show the force of hand (and the limites)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless he feels he has done his all with the jump to 3D. but if so, then he shouldnt have made that crowding bid to begin with|pg||
nt|bridge_one: south give all his cards |pg||
nt|bridge_one: no controls in blacks suit, 6 @h, support with H in @D|pg||
nt|bobholl: can't be sure of @H j so bid 6@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in many partnership styles, 3D would be impossible with N hand, as it is a general principle that a jump rebid in a forcing auction shows a solid suit. not all pairs have that ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agreement though|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: A of @H @D from top :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: making 3 or 4, depending on if he finds the Q@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: For what reason, when I bid so, opponents take their 6-7 @S-trickc|pg||
nt|bobholl: in pairs you would have a very good score but here no difference|pg||
nt|bridge_one: patience|pg||
nt|sybarra: boo hiss |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|henryb: from the subsequent actions I would guess it was a transfer showing 4+ @h|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|bobholl: i have the fairly simple agreement that 4th suit bidder can pass partner can't so than 3 @D or 3@H is obligatory|pg||
pc|c7|nt|henryb: If he tries to split the @h he could go down a lot|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: initial x showed @H|pg||
nt|ady: at least 6 imps and possibly more here|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|april7: where the 9 there is the Q|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
nt|bobholl: glad he is not in 6|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mariner1: well in 3@H I would have hooked for sure........|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|henryb: should win the 9 to tell partner what is going on|pg||
nt|ady: north parted with 1 diamond|pg||
nt|bobholl: !NEXT (joey)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: might still get out down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: I think that John should have played teh 9 on the 3rd round so Michelle would know he had another|pg||
nt|henryb: and then should play @dK, again to tell partner what is going on|pg||
pc|hT|nt|frankaus: after 3@D - a 4@D bid setting @D would have been a reasonable choice - then minorwood|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well that's fine for you, bob, but i would be willing to bet that this NS play 4th suti as a GF on both partners|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|viren169: E/W reached the dizzy height of 4@H in the other room!|pg||

nt|viren169: and passing whtever response no doubt!|pg||

nt|granguru: In fact with a @d lead it also can be made|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|granguru: it is very against probabilities thou|pg||
nt|viren169: and with a 45xx shape?|pg||
nt|viren169: I would prefer pd to pass 2@H on that seq...|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|santyclz: Perfect trumps for a high x-ruff, difficult with 4333 however.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: to avoid a crossruff in the defence, he must clean trumps|pg||

nt|mariner1: NS can make 3N here if they find it|pg||
nt|frankaus: but the real problem would still be identifying the stiff @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: than 2 @D is much better :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, i would certainly have inclined to bid 4D--after all, slam might easily depend on protecting Kx of clubs in the N hand|pg||
mb|1D|nt|werge: 83 % of your HCP´s in the side suits = no weak 2|pg||
nt|april7: another 3NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|bridge_one: yes, 4@D over 3@D would be more easy to understand - now i think North thought to lose A in @C and K in @D|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: making 3 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: 4 @S D = 500|pg||
nt|bobholl: not with that @S suit vulnarable|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agreed, then, that 4D is preferable to 3H by S. but in a You Be the Judge feature, N would almost surely get the lion;s share of the blame, and by a large margin|pg||
nt|bobholl: tricky 3 @S even if they play support doubles (guess they do)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hussein2: best treatment actually|pg||

nt|april7: @H lead and W might  just make it|pg||

pc|hA|nt|snorris: the jack?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mariner1: take duck does not matter|pg||
nt|marlowepi: strange way to play the diamond suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: NS fairly natural, EW strong club|pg||

nt|garnetts: why 2@D on a balanced hand?|pg||
nt|sharkirl: h switch needed|pg||

mb|1N|nt|viren169: Now is this dble take-out of diamonds or just a general value showing dbl?|pg||

pc|c8|nt|granguru: well - when playing ghestem michaels copenhagen or any other....normally you have an opportunity to show the great hand by bidding again|pg||
nt|santyclz: Any idea what 3@hs was?  Obviously not preemptive.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c5|nt|eamongall: convention cards there|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
nt|garnetts: Lets hope they are just settling in|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: reckon 3@H was quite well judged - gave South the chance to bid 3N wiht good pointy-suit stops|pg||

nt|garnetts: This should be a routine 4@S in both rooms|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1@D the usual strong-club catch-all opener|pg||
nt|mrt2000: it's scored as making 3NT|pg||

nt|sharkirl: 3 losers|pg||
mb|d|nt|granguru: 2@S will probably be made...|pg||
nt|mrt2000: making 2 or 3 here, I suppose|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: West reckons he has an adequate spade stopper|pg||

nt|garnetts: I think my oppo should be made to use it|pg||
nt|viren169: playing for high stakes no doubt!|pg||

nt|bobholl: in how many @C ?|pg||

nt|bobh1: i would never bid 1n|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: that's probably where the hand will be played|pg||
nt|bobh1: clear takeout x|pg||
nt|mariner1: Rabbi's have a play for 1N|pg||
nt|othered1: I prefer double, too, but expect we're in the minority.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Declarer has no choice but to drop the King|pg||
nt|mariner1: I do not like 1N but I hate DBL so I bid 1N|pg||
nt|bobh1: 1n leaves you so exposed|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I don't like 1NT, but X seems wrong here... At the table I would probably bid 1NT though|pg||
nt|mariner1: and DBL exposes you to more agony|pg||
nt|bobh1: not sure what you think double promises that you don't have|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: It also depends on how frequently people psych against you...|pg||
nt|bobh1: double brings partner into the game|pg||
nt|bobh1: 1n is very unilateral|pg||
nt|othered1: just in cast partner can bid NT, it may play several tricks better from that side|pg||
nt|mariner1: you do have a slight advantage having your hand over the E opener...... though I|pg||
nt|mariner1: prefer "usually" to have what looks like 2 @S stoppers|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Partner has KJx QTxx KQxxx 9, will partner be able to show this?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for me 1NT is clear at IMPs. the most likely game is 3NT (e.g. pd coul;d have KQxxx of diamonds & Q of clubs)|pg||
nt|mariner1: I don't want partner in the game if he can't bid over 1N :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Marshall and I agree :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: usually when people agree with me they start to rethink their positions|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is one of those "Least Lie" issues and to me 1N is the least lie|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am committed Marshall, or should be committed :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i guess "zero" counts as "least"|pg||
nt|mariner1: well DBL is a big lie to me :)|pg||
nt|othered1: If you agree that the 1N overcaller will be treated as having @C (arbitrarily), east has easy takeout double|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bridge_one: by South yes ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 5 of either minor should fail|pg||
nt|mariner1: well you duck J@S lead and then what does W do?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bobholl: these days a lot of folks open the S hand with 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: difficult for North to avoid a heart lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1NT is an underbid on the S hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobholl: 1/2 @S 2 nt ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: stayman now???|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|bobholl: i can't see the meanings :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: Check Back Stayman|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably S had no systemic option to 3NT, but that call could easily cause NS to miss 6D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A in @D and @h ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: N passing first would not be afraid of missing 6 @D|pg||
pc|dA|nt|me argent: @SJ only shot|pg||

pc|h5|nt|me argent: i said a shot|pg||
nt|bobholl: no 3@H no 4@S so they play it differently|pg||
nt|bobholl: and reach 4@S neatly|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|henryb: this board has a multiplicity of results. One table played 3@c making 4, the par result. Another played 6@c, got the @hA lead, and guessed @d for 920|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the thing is, though, that it isn;t your partnership and its agreements that are playing in this event :)|pg||

nt|viren169: 3D is shortage agreeing spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: even 5@S can go down with the diamond ruff, which would be a bit unlucky|pg||
nt|viren169: maybe showing a void... there are other ways to show a singleton|pg||

mb|p|nt|granguru: -2 if a good @D guess|pg||
pc|hK|nt|garnetts: Crucial when playing splinters that it shows a singlton not a void|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@C is a bit of an overbid... with wasted values in diamonds|pg||

pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: 2@c was forcing to game|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||

nt|garnetts: club feels OK--might have led a trump--but not when I can see all hands|pg||

nt|bobholl: muiderberg is played by 70% of the dutchmann are they all crazy :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: muid. played in Egypt |pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is my favorite convention......for my opponents to play|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also Sabine Auken and Dany play muid :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: but with 4/7|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: Well done in the other room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: basically it says: "i want my opps to bid a game they wouldnt otherwise bid, so that they can make it thanks to my bid when they would not otherwise make it"|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzkh: 7S cheap even nowadays|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|april7: 1@D by W then 1@H and 2@S by E(weak)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@S Double ?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: will West do an advanced sacrifice here?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 15 opposite 14 with no fits|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: that's my 4@S !|pg||
nt|april7: could be , but 4@S for sure going 2 down, but NS might go to 5@H|pg||
nt|snorris: hoping for a pass in north..|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess on last hand, north was hoping 2@S would come back to him (not 3 or 4) and he'd then be able to double -- and perhaps bid game by himself?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: 7 diamonds ambition   need to negotiate the clubs|pg||
nt|bobholl: depends on your style if you open with 11-12 balanced|pg||
nt|werge: North has a lot of intermedias, so 3 NT directe is a good shot - on a @H-lead|pg||
nt|werge: - og, he allready did, good connection - Denmark-Egypt|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: ambitious|pg||
nt|ady: yes   7 spades a good save|pg||
nt|marlowepi: worth playing at MPs, yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: now  4 @s|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 4@S is much worse|pg||
nt|henryb: If you are going to save, do it right away|pg||
nt|snorris: dont likes his king of @h west|pg||
nt|henryb: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: diamonds not mentioned yet|pg||
nt|bobholl: normal in guess in @C 9 tricks :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello henry|pg||
nt|bobholl: agree completely :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|snorris: hi|pg||
nt|henryb: the @hK is bad for defense and offense|pg||
nt|mariner1: probably was Ed,,,,,, however he who waits and that stuff.............|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzkh: overkill - duplicated good results|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a stronger version, where opener has a real opening bid, can be a useful tool|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: i dont like allowing them to bid game and then saving|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like them to have the last guess|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bobholl: 2 off but a direct 4@S would have been much more effective (may be:))|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - he can´t handle Q 9 x x ist East - but in West|pg||
nt|snorris: well it came out good for e-w|pg||
nt|henryb: I like them to have less information when they guess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: eventually i will stop waffling and utter some actual opinions LOL|pg||
pc|h9|nt|henryb: this will lose 4 aces, 300 and 15 imps for England|pg||
nt|ady: great resuult for England|pg||
nt|bobholl: migth finesse other way now but don't think so @S length compansated by @H length in E ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: to speak with johan cruijf elk voordeel heb se nadeel (every advantage also has a disadvantage)|pg||
nt|sybarra: so of no purpose for the preemptive value then if you play it strong (imo) |pg||
pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: as Milton said (sort of): "they also starve who only stand and wait"|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: relatively straightforward set of hands here... not many chances for big swings|pg||
pc|h5|nt|snorris: n-s might have bid 5 on direct 4 @s|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|frankaus: mini multi played here by Gill, Del'monte and others - weak 2 either M (3-7) - no strong options|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, 2-way weak 2 bids have a lot going for them|pg||
nt|frankaus: then 2@H@S 8-11 |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, they are finding ways to generate swings on some of them...|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess that style is OK if you really think you can trust or read your opponents, but I hate to have to rely on them forme to get to our best spot.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: that is true :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: well we are back to a 5 imp set|pg||
nt|othered1: In any case, this is a close match and the teams have been "in contact" the whole match.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|d3|nt|bobh1: what are "ashtrays"?|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|werge: In SUCH a contract, you must claim as soon as possible...|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|mariner1: we have 27 boards to score so lots of time|pg||
nt|mariner1: again Marshall and I agree.....and I quit smoking :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: must be something they have in Australia|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: in the immortal words of Keith MacNeil (longtime director of the Australian equivalent of Master Solvers' Club) in regard to a panelist who Passed on a problem with the comment ...|pg||

nt|viren169: East has pushed the boat out too far...|pg||
nt|viren169: I assume 2@D was spme sort of opening with 6+ diamonds?|pg||
nt|viren169: No need for East to bid? Was there?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not really Gad--South would have bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: If 21D was passed to him|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@D |pg||
nt|viren169: Yes on this hand... odds are that the opps dont have the values to come in?!?!|pg||
nt|garnetts: NS can make 130 in clubs |pg||

nt|ralfwil: I don´t like this doubles! Act immediately and not now! What will he do after 3@c?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: S would have been under pressure on the run of the @Cs|pg||
nt|eamongall: 4@S-1 is a sad effort by Walsh O'gorman |pg||
pc|sA|nt|granguru: another way to treat with this things is that the revoking player receives an electroshock when card is taken out of his deck|pg||
pc|s5|nt|granguru: :)|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||

pc|s3|nt|granguru: eventually you have more control with a 5-2 than a 4-3 trump distirbution|pg||
nt|viren169: Ummmmm, I think 2@D has taken clubs out of the auction!|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@D has the potential to entice an injudicious North|pg||
nt|santyclz: I first became acquainted with this not being a penalty x when I was holding aqj10xx of the suit.|pg||

nt|santyclz: Seemed to be a give up play.|pg||

nt|garnetts: They are deliberately provoking me--why open 1NT when you have AQJxxx in a minor---often leads to missed games|pg||

nt|snorris: agree|pg||

nt|snorris: going down..|pg||
nt|henryb: 6@s is a very decent contract|pg||
nt|henryb: and can be made|pg||
nt|snorris: sure|pg||
nt|bridge_one: work very well in MP comp|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also used by some top British pairs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: whatever type of 2 bids one finds attractive, the most important thing is to assign the meaning to 2S that allows you to make that opening bid as often as possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: conservative pass by West|pg||
nt|april7: watch:18 P|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|april7: modern style|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: excellent 1NT opener--but i would do it at any colors and in any seat|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and weakish one-suiters are a more common handtype than weakish 5-5s|pg||
pc|d2|nt|snorris: has to make the right finesse choice|pg||
nt|bobholl: but not made in practice i fear |pg||
nt|henryb: why not?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: South will do well to pass, and let EW get in trouble|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: 2@C?|pg||
nt|henryb: I think E miscounted, or they have high standards for 4-4-4-1 hands|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the 10/12 like Fantoni Nunes :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|april7: bad trump brake, with @D finesse 12 tricks with @H finesse down in 6|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6 of @C lead|pg||
nt|henryb: so?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|henryb: 3@s is a strange call|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|henryb: or they are playing a different board|pg||
nt|bobholl: @S loser and @H loser :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: sign in Officer's Quarters when I was in Air Force......  "No Smoking in Bed" and|pg||
nt|bobh1: but would you also do it playing weak nt?|pg||
nt|mariner1: underneath someone added "and No Sleeping in the Ashtrays"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here minimum 2@S made  - E/W are 1Down at 2@h - i think no swing|pg||
nt|bobholl: seen some treemendous results from that "strong" weak two but caused by good players :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trouble doesn;t have a capital T when we are nonvul|pg||
nt|othered1: I was going to say "this worked out nicely," then west bid over 2@D|pg||
nt|frankaus: Bobby Richman uses 5@S+ less the opening even with 5332|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mtvesuvius: this is a very unlucky lie of the cards... off 1 at least|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|henryb: W miscounted, sorry|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|ady: I think this was a weak sequence   2@H after 1NT constructive   but West did not want to take any notice|pg||
nt|me argent: and who can blame him?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but choice of finesses |pg||
nt|henryb: win @c, play 4 rounds of trumps; win the @d, repeat the @c finesse and showup squeeze South|pg||
nt|marlowepi: OUCH|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|henryb: we can|pg||
nt|othered1: but we should let them play it out, just in case|pg||

nt|snorris: and even better , if s leads c east cn ruff @ds good with entry|pg||

pc|s7|nt|snorris: if north covers clubs that is|pg||
nt|bobholl: but on @C lead not duckked can trump @D first and mmake :)|pg||

pc|c2|nt|mariner1: there is one|pg||
pc|c5|pg||

nt|april7: only @D finesse will make a successful slam|pg||

nt|sybarra: on the other hand this could work |pg||
pc|h5|nt|yo_yo: best defense that duck|pg||
nt|bobholl: that possiblity is gone now :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|othered1: didn't we just burn an entry prematurely?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: if he did not rate his hand worth opening  why stretch later|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no, not if he drove out club ace|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c6|nt|mariner1: yes needed to play high @c from hand|pg||
nt|othered1: wasn't @S in dummy, @C (ducked) @D to hand, drive @C the line?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S pretty much marked with club ace so need to drive it out and set up club tricks, counting on heart ace onside|pg||
nt|mariner1: while he still had K@D|pg||
nt|othered1: While he still had @DK and @SA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, ed, but with H ace onside he was still golden if he just drove clubs|pg||

nt|bobholl: 4 @S looks best :)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5 ! makes if you guess @H but 4@H on repeated @S s ?|pg||
nt|april7: why not 3@H???|pg||
nt|werge: Never bid 3 @D - 2 @H is the best bid for East|pg||
nt|frankaus: the richman style has had the effect that opps have had to rethink - how to compete as often neither opp is short enough in @S to make a t/o X |pg||
pc|d2|nt|bobholl: don't ask me :) i would surely have bid it|pg||
nt|april7: is 2@H 4th s gf or not?|pg||
nt|henryb: I think 6@s looks best; but who am I|pg||
nt|snorris: nice @d break..|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Noshy is thinking of slam now|pg||
nt|henryb: just on the lie of the cards of course|pg||
nt|bobholl: well with 52 crds you are rigth :)|pg||
nt|april7: they just made a good slam, why not try another|pg||
nt|bobholl: when the QJ of @S would have been small ones you'd bid the same so you should do something|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we dont know if they're thinking or if it's the connection|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: looks like a simple 4@H|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: makig with an overtrick|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: (without a @c lead)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: too bad. S will go unpunsihed|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|henryb: I think that is a very good bid|pg||
nt|othered1: west has a nasty hand.  To begin with 2@C (if natural) and then make a slam try (3@H?) feels like you may trap partner with good but not fabulous @C into going too high.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: strange that W did not bid over 1NT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobholl: strang bid in my partnerships it asks ab out spade strength and you know it is bad|pg||
nt|henryb: but 5@h would have been even better|pg||
pc|c4|nt|april7: smith peter?|pg||
nt|bobholl: would be very convenient now|pg||
nt|bobholl: but always play in your 7 crd suit if you have 74 :)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|henryb: tricky hand to play|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
nt|bobholl: as i already remarked with the 109 in @S and @D good contract but i agree that N should play it if you only see Sth hand|pg||

nt|garnetts: Leading a trump must never be an excuse for not thinking|pg||
nt|garnetts: Lot of players use it too much|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting 1@C or 1@S opening by West?|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1@S every time for me |pg||
nt|viren169: Technically 1@C but most would open it 1@S|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1@C is hardly ever best when it could be prepared |pg||
nt|viren169: Technically 1@C is best... |pg||
nt|garnetts: But--with say   Qxxxx  Ax  x  AKxxx  maybe 1@C is better--that is bad spades and good clubs|pg||
nt|santyclz: Had a strip-sqz endplay against n for +2 if he returned a @d and cashed @cs.|pg||

nt|ralfwil: without any special reason|pg||
mb|4H|nt|santyclz: Y, @c duck with those beautiful @ss was very strange.|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Now 2@S over 2@C should be normal... keeping North out of the auction (Not that he wants to come in!)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: what?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: And you know your P @d|pg||
nt|starkist: hmm|pg||
nt|ralfwil: leading from a 10 or J often gives declarer a good help|pg||
pc|dK|nt|viren169: Looks like West was more worried about letting N in|pg||
nt|garnetts: I must admit that 2@S would always get me a singleton trump|pg||
nt|viren169: 8/9 tricks available here for a flat(ish) board|pg||
nt|sharkirl: can this be true??|pg||
nt|starkist: intended as forcing i'm sure|pg||

nt|eamongall: Adam Mesbur and Pat Walshe have had a miserable/unlucky  time this weekend |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|viren169: void for me!|pg||

nt|garnetts: I have just been advised that 2@S shows clubs too|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|ady: slam on a finess to start|pg||
nt|werge: West 4 @H - North leads the @H 4...|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H by EW,not easy to reach|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult to reach the cold 4@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: true hans the 4 of @H migth work :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i bet there's a discussion over that 5@S bid|pg||
nt|bobholl: if it asks for @S quality it is a bad bid (QJ are missing)|pg||
nt|frankaus: true but often both have a balanced 12-14 , and no way into the auction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the score showing is not up to date--there are several comparisons yet to come in|pg||
mb|1C|nt|yo_yo: 1 2 or 3@D all possible openings here|pg||
nt|snorris: 5 @ds is the limit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and meanwhile 2C might turn out useful in deflecting a club lead|pg||
nt|othered1: What is their NT range?|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: but who leads a singleton trump?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 84 minutes (and 3 boards to play) until final session here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably like mine: "it feels like 1NT"...|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think EW use 15-17|pg||
nt|bobh1: wonder if 2@h is natural or capp|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: yes    very poor set in both rooms|pg||
nt|snorris: or 3 nt..|pg||
nt|bobholl: 65 come alive :)|pg||

mb|2H|nt|mariner1: 2N probably Lebensohl asking for E to bid 3@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: other room played 2 bds on  the bottom of the stack first,  we will see comparison next hand |pg||
nt|bobholl: support double available W will surely bid 4@H now|pg||
nt|sybarra: but also, they seem to be playing a leirsurely pace|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4H|nt|april7: W could have tried for a @H fit with 3 @H and then E must bid 3NT|pg||
nt|snorris: @s lead?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: trump lead is devastating here...|pg||
nt|othered1: planning to convert to the fine @D suit?  Would have looked better if it were just for minors.|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Now they bid it 100%|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: in fact better    as the club can be discarded on the 3rd heart     as long as spades behave|pg||
nt|april7: but 3NT is better played by W ofcourse|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@D goes for a lot :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzkh: much better|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: a Wald grand I think|pg||
nt|snorris: lucky west can only play on @cs|pg||
nt|mariner1: to who?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is much to be said for bidding 4C instead of 4H with the W hand. If NS save, we want a club lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3 down at 5@D - so good choose by South to pass at 4@H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|werge: 101 now|pg||
nt|bobholl: 8 tricks there already  and any @C lead will work|pg||
pc|d6|nt|april7: 1NT after X is in my system mini Truscott,good 2 @HG raise|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|snorris: not @h|pg||
nt|frankaus: green V green saves rarely show a good profit|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|me argent: not making or having a 3 level forcing @S raise cost here|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: I'm not sure what 4@H showed ...|pg||
nt|ady: cant blame North    South could have better cards in clubs and diamonds  and bad spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: If just a Q, it ought to be all the plain aces|pg||
nt|bobh1: S doing the right things so far|pg||

mb|p|nt|eamongall: Meanwhile EBU have passed the century deal|pg||

nt|viren169: are they in GF now? or can it be dropped at the 3@H level?|pg||
nt|granguru: 2@c looks like a @D transfer|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 1 off here as like as not|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: The lead suggests that 2@hs may have shown 2 suits such as @hs and a minor.|pg||
nt|granguru: so the lead is clear|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: around 10 tricks|pg||
nt|granguru: @Dk to maintain the lead!|pg||
mb|p|pc|d6|nt|mrt2000: 11 now, perhaps|pg||
pc|d2|nt|viren169: It is nat and Invite now... with 6 hearts...|pg||
nt|viren169: I am sure West will be pleased to see a diamond or two in dummy!|pg||
nt|granguru: and cross @cs|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|garnetts: I think East should bid 3@D after 2NT--but then again I am old fashioned why let partner know you have short hearts and a six card suit|pg||

pc|d7|pg||

nt|mrt2000: N couldn't handle to @S successfully|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: A demonstration of why leads matter --a spade and dec has no play |pg||
nt|santyclz: X or whatever shows the majors?|pg||

nt|santyclz: Probably lebensohl.|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: except that it is played by West|pg||
nt|viren169: 1@S denies spades I guess|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|granguru: As it will here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|viren169: and 1N probably show spades... to right side the NT|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|garnetts: That is an example of what I mean by an alert being necessary|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As I play I can show a 1-card major (defined) and another 4-card suit, so we can find our 5-4 in @s|pg||
pc|h9|nt|granguru: A @D lead beats 4@H |pg||
nt|viren169: North has done well to introduce hearts!|pg||
nt|granguru: this contract will probably fail|pg||
nt|eamongall: EBU vouchers are great ... you can buy bridge books from Brian Senior |pg||
pc|h8|nt|granguru: a @D lead could  help declarer a lot|pg||
nt|mrt2000: it will make on a red suit lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|garnetts: well done North |pg||

nt|bobholl: but NS have a good save available in 6@S|pg||
nt|werge: 800, |pg||
nt|april7: a much better hand to open by W|pg||
nt|mariner1: if you FORCE a partner to bid its usually best to then ask if he has a good hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Not good even then.   |pg||
nt|marlowepi: even then it is a terrible slam. there have to be better opportunities. like hope your opponents bid it, thinking that you will|pg||
nt|mariner1: now the last board of this session....... plenty to score though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: interesting that W discarded all 3 spades--never won or lost a spade trick !|pg||
nt|sybarra: this  is last hand for this room |pg||
nt|bridge_one: ty Shirley for the inf :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks to our terrific operator Amir.  Job well done! |pg||

nt|bobholl: S will take insurance :)|pg||
nt|april7: 6@D on a good @H guess|pg||
nt|bobholl: won't misguess after weak jump :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but will west trust his 6 small @D :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would open the west hand always (may be not in 4th)|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|ady: 2H about limite    East will likely to bid to 3@D   one too high on a spade lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: a big THANKS! to Unknown (Egypt), our superb operator, for doing an excellent|pg||
nt|mariner1: job!!!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bobh1: is this a support x?|pg||

nt|werge: Pass here is invitation from West|pg||
nt|bobholl: if partner invites and i have AKQ of trumps ??|pg||
nt|april7: E should bid 6@D after 5@C by W, where does W take this bid if not very strong and distributional, which he is only distributional|pg||
nt|bobholl: but what if we miss AK of @H ??|pg||
nt|werge: Then West had doubled!|pg||
nt|april7: can't be  missing 2 aces|pg||

nt|mariner1: Khalil (Egypt), and Roland Wald (Denmark).....I am Rob Brown (USA)........|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is a dangerous double, even if played as support (which most people play as limited to the 2 level)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at|pg||
nt|mariner1: it!|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|april7: so W has only AK of @C??:):)|pg||
nt|werge: East knows, that partners opening bid is based og 17 HCP in @H and @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: now @H lead so no problems :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: who bid 6@S W or N ?|pg||
