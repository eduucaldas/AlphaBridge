nt|Walddk2: 6 tables in play|pg||
nt|hedyg: true|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: the official website with results from round 9 is : http://www.israbridge.com/home/results/2009/open09-f-e.htm|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets see if they play SA texas|pg||
nt|vugraphznc: he might invite to slam so start with 2@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: that hand is not good enough for an invite IMO|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: no, but if he does his partner will accept|pg||
nt|hedyg: queens are overrated|pg||
nt|vugraphznc: if partner had AS instead of AD then 6@C is great spot|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d8|nt|hedyg: when you invite to slam in @H you rarely get to 6@c........|pg||
nt|vugraphznc: he could start with 2@D and follow with 3@C|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT-2@D-2@H-4@H would be an invite|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: but maybe 3@c instead of 4@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: bd 5 2@D by E in CR|pg||

mb|1D|nt|hedyg: the 1@C/@D argument.....|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 1@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yuval10: clear 1@d... what would you do if it goes (1@h ) X  (P ) ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: if you open 1@c, that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: I don't see the advantage of opening 1@c, unless you use some relays etc over 1@c... then it's still not 100% clear|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: how would 4@d do?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mtvesuvius: making or -1 I think|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs a @d lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: -1 more likely|pg||
nt|hedyg: vs 4@d i mean|pg||
nt|vugraphznc: this can make but have to be played very carefully|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have no strong feelings re 1@C/@D. Some even open 1@C or 1@D randomly, like Michael Rosenberg and Zia did when they were a partnership|pg||
nt|hedyg: leaddirecting Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Depends on my mood|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: just whatever they felt like :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|d9|nt|hedyg: S has no reason to overtake this|pg||
nt|vugraphznc: amir played the high @D to be in hand to lead another trump but bareket thinking to overtake to play @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: but he can see the K@C in dummy and controls @s|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|s2|nt|vugraphznc: not playing AH on lead seems now a bit expensive|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: why keep the @Ds?|pg||
