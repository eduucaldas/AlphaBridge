nt|Walddk2: But some here|pg||
nt|yuval10: but looks like it might change here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think I ever balanced on a 5 count|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: I had to check the bidding a few times. I could not believe that it was West who had doubled. |pg||
nt|davidb: that one is interesting . see W  X in the closed !  wow !|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yuval10: N opened 2@s next door, and after W balance-X and E passed, it was South to save the day and bid 3@d|pg||
mb|3D|nt|othered1: this could be amusing|pg||
nt|brolucius: I will have to check if 'totally bananas' is a BBO-permitted phrase.|pg||
nt|othered1: does south's pass show @D?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: It's impossible that you can't make 3NT when holding the East cards after a balancing double at the 2-level, vulnerable|pg||
mb|3S|nt|brolucius: I see that it isn't. Well, I apologise.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But 'bonkers' is permitted|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and that describes the double quite well|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@S should be OK to make.|pg||
nt|ady: the pass by South would indicate a willingness to play in diamonds  with some holding opposite|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|yuval10: after the Q@h lead, declarer will understand what's happening here|pg||
nt|davidb: good stop .NS make 3D|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|yuval10: we might see 5,2,3  in the first round of @s|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: East will know where the @S are|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: looks around 9 imps to Israel|pg||
nt|brolucius: With a 5-count, it would be dangerous to protect if you were a passed hand. As a non-passed hand, the action is hard to describe without straying beyond the BBO rules.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|brolucius: Let's just say that it is a well deserved swing to Israel.|pg||

nt|yuval10: 6@d makes here, but not very likely they'll reach there, not does they need to|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cards sitting exceptionally well for declarer in spades here|pg||
nt|yuval10: *nor|pg||

nt|werge: So we get a slam here|pg||
nt|farrukh: well how many of you say this final is not over yet?|pg||
nt|werge: You cannot make 6 @H -unless North takes his Ace og @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: nasty breaks in tyhe black suits may make the slam a little awkward|pg||
nt|werge: of|pg||
nt|oosmanb: what did i miss 3@H made??|pg||
nt|oosmanb: interesting hand here, was watching this in OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes|pg||
nt|werge: 6 @H is clearly better|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6h more chance than 6N|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry snap!!|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|farrukh: so if E/W even make game the last nail will be pinned in Candylands Coffin|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N!|nt|vugraphzkt: max 2 3 4 4 shape|pg||
nt|lestergold: whreas  ht slam on these cards is certainly better than a roland slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|werge: So 5 @H now|pg||
nt|lestergold: likley try|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: wants @S lead?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: or a -90 imps dbl?|pg||
mb|p|nt|farrukh: good dbl for 2 imps minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: well @S lead is the only double dummy lead on which you can not make|pg||
nt|oosmanb: according to GIB|pg||
nt|lestergold: the double is the sort of bid which normally attracts a redouble and make|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: luckily for north no one can redouble and few would make either|pg||
nt|werge: @D to the 10 = 12 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: Squeeze they call it|pg||
nt|lestergold: but with north showing spade length why should east play north for dim length too?|pg||
nt|werge: Almost...|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d4|nt|werge: @D to the ten is only real hope for two tricks in that suit|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @S and @D is best shot i think|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but if north ducks you can not make|pg||

nt|yuval10: maybe a chance here for Poland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last train, 4@H before, the only remaining slam-try below the level of game, sometimes used to encourage a further slam try but unrelated to the holding in the suit bid|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|othered1: Why is it last train if 4@D was also available?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Derives from Last Train to Claksville|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ed can tell us where in the US that is|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s is down of course|pg||
nt|brolucius: East's double, collecting 500, is reminiscent of one we saw by only one of the West players in the first half. |pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|othered1: I assume 2@H showed a 2-suiter of some sort?|pg||
nt|davidb: 2 bad boards for Israel -15,16|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|brolucius: North could hardly avoid opening at the other table (on his fine hand) but it has led to a poor result.|pg||
nt|yuval10: @h lead leaves declarer with only 7 tricks - 4@s, 2@h , 1@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: @C lead will give him the contract, I think.  |pg||
