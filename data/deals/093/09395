nt|brolucius: South's initial negative double (when holding four-card spade support) is unorthodox - in the Open Room.|pg||

mb|1H!|nt|brolucius: East may bid 3@C anyway. No, 2@C.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: welcome back all. scotland didn't get kilt in the first half, but they do trail by the narrowest of margins|pg||
nt|viren169: hi all|pg||
nt|jallerton: Both teams still in contention|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: and we're off.|pg||
nt|eamongall: at first glance I don't see much for anyone ...|pg||
nt|eamongall: I will hazard a guess at EW playing in 1NT |pg||
nt|viren169: Off we go...|pg||
nt|mowen: Could make a difference - probably to who comes 2nd!|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Is Norman in his seat?|pg||

nt|mowen: EBU have done v well|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jallerton: EW play strong @c|pg||
nt|mowen: I gather Garvey/Cooke have an unusual system|pg||
nt|finch: yes.  For the first board, sufficient to know that it includes a strong club|pg||
nt|finch: I have the WBF card and 43-page system file in front of me|pg||
nt|mowen: nice solid overcall by west|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@s = constructive raise, 7-10 with 3-card support|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Tim :)|pg||
nt|henryb: Hi|pg||
nt|mariner1: well we start with a slam here|pg||

nt|mowen: allows east to muddy the waters|pg||
nt|finch: welcome also to Graham Osborne who will be with us for the first few boards|pg||
nt|mowen: hi Graham|pg||
nt|finch: The first page of the system file tells us that "the declarership can often be swtiched to either side (ideal for mixed pairs)"|pg||
nt|finch: Though I'm not sure they've ever found anyone else prepared to play the system with them!|pg||
nt|viren169: yes|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N is a forcing raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: welcome all|pg||
nt|mowen: its hard to play in the style of Martin Garvey|pg||
nt|mowen: well someone is in his seat:)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|marlowepi: 3NT is a make here, but some NS might alternatively fetch up in the 4-3 spade fit|pg||
nt|finch: Never a truer word was said|pg||
nt|eamongall: For EBU we have Martin Garvey and Jon Cooke a regular pairing playing on BBO most nights with various English juniors and ex-junios|pg||
nt|viren169: Selway is there now...|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Hi Michael|pg||
mb|4H|nt|viren169: Interesting South did not dble weak NT|pg||
nt|viren169: Just as well!|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: transfer & delayed raise to game = mild slam try for pairs playing Texas (4-level transfer), the latter showing no slam aspirations|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are some options inb the defense and play revolving around the club suit|pg||
nt|cindy: hi all|pg||
nt|henryb: DOIGB|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@S is destined to go off...|pg||
mb|4N|nt|jcomyn: This is a really vital match between holders and England. If I see correctly, Derek O'Gorman and TerryWalsh are in much to my surprise as they are Trophy debutants|pg||
nt|finch: Final contract the normal one, however|pg||
nt|mowen: easy 11 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb: which stands for Down One Is Good Bridge|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure I like 2N...|pg||
nt|mowen: yup, looks like -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Marshall Lewis and Paul Gipson|pg||
nt|jcomyn: This is a baptism of fire for them|pg||
nt|mayors: Hi Steve,Frances and Specs|pg||
nt|jallerton: With 3 diamond losers, he'll need to pick up the spades for no loser|pg||
nt|jallerton: This lead puts dec. in dummy.  Will he win and finesse spades immediately?|pg||
nt|jallerton: From dec.'s point of view, @d may be 2-2 in which case a spade loser can be afforded|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@S is enough after overcalling...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@h is possible|pg||
mb|5D|nt|paulg: Good evening everyone|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hi Roland & Paul & specs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: was 2NT something special? or intended as such? it doesn't seem to leap off the screen on the N hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N interesting,,,,,,,,, must be systemic for them|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi cindy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: That is Walsh not Walshe operator|pg||
nt|viren169: Cards well placed for declarer.|pg||
nt|chick: making is better :)|pg||
nt|mowen: a bit keen, I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4N key card, 5@D showing 0-3|pg||
mb|5H|nt|jallerton: 2@h transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: aha so the 3N was specific @S shortness|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: Cameron says S too strong for 2@s.  But no spade honours and AK d/ton|pg||
nt|eamongall: for Ireland we have Derek O Gorman ...who played in World Pairs Final back in 1990 as a 20 year old  but has been retired since about 1993 from serious bridge |pg||
nt|ppiglett: West missed the suit pref card of the 6D|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: wanted to set up his spades if pd had xx|pg||
nt|eamongall: and his partner Terry Walsh who is well known on the Dublin bridge scene..|pg||
nt|eamongall: both making their Camrose debut |pg||
nt|eamongall: I take a point from the gallery ...."Camrose is not serious bridge" ...  I think the players involved are taking it seriously |pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Declarer will be uncomfortable in 2N but will eventually come up with 8 tricks!|pg||
nt|viren169: bit too much to drink?|pg||
nt|mariner1: very well bid, now to make though play should be fairly quick|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks looks easy|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes and should make 13 in fact|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jallerton: S was never going to find @cK lead at trick 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: the lucky lead the favourable lie oft he sapdes looks like will see this soemwhat shaky 3n home|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: odd not to cash a top club before the third spade|pg||
nt|henryb: well on this hand N-S would make 3@c for 110, and 3@h will lose two diamonds and one of each for -50|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Agreed about the S but one off is a f|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Peter Goodman from Wales|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: http://www.ebu.co.uk/internationals/Camrose2009Results.htm  for results and standing after round 1 (including carryover from the first weekend)|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@C here|pg||

mb|1D!|an|nat maybe longer C|nt|paulg: Spears and Murdoch are both experienced players but a relatively new partnership|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we can see that S made a correct evaluation of the slam potential of the S hand even facing a weak NT on that deal by observing that if the 2 black queens in the N hand were ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: instead the ace of clubs, slam would be a favorite|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@d 10-15, no 5-card major|pg||

nt|mariner1: Results|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: in effect, the fourth spade squeezed E (non-materially) out of the club spot which would have given S a losing option in the play|pg||
nt|viren169: guess in spades for overtrick|pg||
nt|mowen: now Shields/Denning chance to show their strong club|pg||
nt|finch: Yes, it's huge|pg||

nt|viren169: Light opening... yet again!|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|finch: I doubt they can make it however with South being short in both clubs and hearts|pg||

nt|petepunt: afternoon all|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: not sure i would be leaping over 1S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S is worth more than 2D but is hoping to be able to bid spades at a convenient level so making a slight tactical underbid|pg||
nt|lestergold: Howard's spade overall at unfavourable vulnerability was not recopmmended by my freat grandmother|pg||
nt|mayors: yes would agree|pg||
nt|mowen: I know players who would have bid S@s as south|pg||
nt|finch: The system cards are at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/camroseteams.htm|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: predictable lead giving a much needed trick|pg||
nt|jallerton: win in hand and play @sQ.  West needs to duck this|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer will win in hand and try a spade which west has to duck to ensure the killing of the suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: sorry Jeffery snp|pg||
nt|finch: EW play a more natural style of strong club, 1NT was FG balanced and 2@H natural|pg||
nt|jcomyn: h well placed for 3N  but willbe in 4S|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@c = relay .  I think 2NT is too.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: good day from sunny vancouver|pg||
nt|finch: 2NT showed a doubleton heart, 3@S natural and 4@C a cue for spades|pg||
nt|mowen: and so to 6@S but can they make it?|pg||
nt|eamongall: this appears to have 3 tricks to lose|pg||
nt|mowen: tempting at this vul|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Do you agree with P on E? I vote for 1@s|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW could have played @S yes|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: hi martin|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: i don;t understand that double at all|pg||

nt|vugraphzkp: Cooke looking at @hJ|pg||
nt|henryb: really, the false preference! they must promise 5+ clubs for this auction|pg||
nt|chick: many people these days are playing that 1@S shows an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|petepunt: yes rebids 1nt with bal 15-17 even with 4@S|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|sharkirl: reprieve|pg||
nt|viren169: Now N/S will be going to the races... |pg||
nt|viren169: Somebody ought to tell Norman he is not as young as he use to be!|pg||
pc|c5|nt|james_h: Operator please Click on North and change to 'Walsh'|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 club tricks now one spade and one heart thats 5 tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: h lead might have caused problems this wont|pg||
pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: N didn't double, and S has close to zero defense|pg||
pc|c4|nt|paulg: i don't really understand North's pass .. no reason for this to be forcing is there?|pg||
nt|finch: In the England match against NI, Townsend has gone two off in 6@S when we rose with the ace of hearts on a heart lead|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: are we on together James|pg||
nt|viren169: with Q of @S instead of Q@D 7 is a good contract|pg||
nt|sharkirl: may well bid 7|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to find out about the Q of @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: mybe an endplay against eat at some point form a sixth trick but seven looks unlikely|pg||
pc|c2|nt|eamongall: split trump honors was required ...so unlucky|pg||
nt|henryb: but in that style South should respond 1@h, not 1@d|pg||
nt|petepunt: n/s weak nt |pg||
pc|c7|nt|barbyh: das it, you it|pg||
nt|james_h: thanks operator!|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cindy: its not forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: none at all|pg||
nt|viren169: 5@S is 2 with Q|pg||
nt|mowen: don't thik it is possible with south only holding 2 clubs |pg||
nt|eamongall: and the 10 onside contributes our Sydney correspondant Thomas Hanlon|pg||
nt|eamongall: and as maker64 indicates the @D5 can gorw |pg||
nt|ciaran: Promoted a third trump there by overtaking the @D6 if that's how play went|pg||
nt|eamongall: gorw|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@C probably denies any kings|pg||
nt|jallerton: Even on a @h lead, declarer will test the spades, see S show out and take rthe marked finesse|pg||
nt|eamongall: grow |pg||
nt|ppiglett: We've all been in worse - Tom?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: endplay inevitable really|pg||
nt|jallerton: Eastshort of exits|pg||
pc|c9|nt|james_h: Pat is hoping Adam will wake up with the Q@S|pg||
nt|viren169: N is still none the wiser...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|paulg: @hK would test North|pg||
nt|james_h: thats why Pat used 5NT|pg||
nt|finch: you might be able to do it if South is something like 5314, but even then I think you need slightly better spade pips|pg||
nt|finch: I shall be surprised if this is not a flat board, +- the odd 50 points|pg||
nt|mowen: bridge can be a hard game|pg||
nt|henryb: indeed, but still, if North will rebid 1N with a balanced 15-17, you lose the value of opening 1@c with a strong NT when South does not respond 1@h and North will not rebid 1@h ...|pg||
nt|henryb: with 4|pg||

nt|viren169: yes|pg||
pc|dT|nt|paulg: you have to guess the spades in 5@d to make, although you are favourite to do so|pg||
nt|paulg: North's lack of a double may work to his advantage here|pg||

nt|marlowepi: strange bidding & strange defense|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||

nt|viren169: Espen wont be too happy with the result... although after passing... 4@S will still be reached.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|viren169: declarer will eliminate the hand and end up hooking the spade Q when nothing else works.|pg||

pc|h3|pg||

nt|brolucius: An excellent slam because you have a club discard for the diamond loser.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|d!|nt|brolucius: At the other table East bid Unusual 2NT over 1@H and South used one of the minor-suit bids (3@C) to show a strong heart raise.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: That method is known in the USA as Unusual over Unusual.|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|bjacobs: 7@D doubled is par|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, unless North try 7@H ...|pg||
nt|werge: Good bidding by East and West|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and you wonder when hearts are going to be bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would be easier for N-S is South had been allowed to bid 2@H to show a positivie response with at least five hearts.|pg||
nt|werge: Has anybody showm @h-suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: South will not like his doubleton diamond now, although the E-W bidding has suggested that north will hold a singleton diamond at most.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: A Pass by South will be forcing and doubtless a stronger move than Double. Ah, he has passed.|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|bjacobs: Breathes life into the match|pg||
nt|brolucius: Very effective pre-emption and this shows how the Precision Club system can be disrupted. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Particularly white versus red|pg||
nt|werge: This 13-IMP victory is well deserved|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This vulnerability is so unpleasant for strong-clubbers|pg||
nt|brolucius: South should be able to bid 2@H. No point in wasting time with a pointless double and not showing your five-card major.|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: If they play that 2@H is 4-7, or some such, I do not think it is a good method.|pg||

nt|vugraphzkp: yep, and he's duly tonked 1S|pg||

mb|p|nt|mayors: To make 6@s on previous board is completely DD|pg||
nt|mowen: 9 tricks? or 10?|pg||
nt|finch: They play this as fairly constructive, but this is still top of the range|pg||
nt|jcomyn: an understatement|pg||

nt|vugraphzkp: the Eng-Sco result could be good for EBU, who play Scotland in the last match|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3@C shows much more here|pg||
mb|p|nt|jferg: the n.i pair play a strong club system with 14 16 no trump|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is this a weak no trump pair for N ireland|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok|pg||
nt|viren169: not sure what South was planning... but it has turned a plus score to a minus!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably the cheapest with pass|pg||
nt|mariner1: pass is cheaper here and W does it|pg||
pc|hK|nt|james_h: Terry passing the buck|pg||
nt|lestergold: at t5his vulernability i would have ventured 2c by south|pg||
nt|othered1: That's the best west could do.  Those who take out takeout doubles would be punished here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzkp: you can also have insufficient tonks|pg||
nt|viren169: S may tap in on the way out!|pg||
nt|viren169: He has seen 3rd in hand openings before...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mowen: the Sing Q@H is useful|pg||
nt|finch: did you work that out all on your own?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Heart leads will promote @sQ.  However, with @cK onside that is it for the defence|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Did well to buy this one|pg||
nt|mowen: kindly minor breaks|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cards lay as you would place them |pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard to use jumps by opener if 12-14, but if 14-16 ok. still, does S jump every time he has a 4 card fit?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good shot by Terry|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like e/w are overboard|pg||
nt|henryb: Much more after partner bids 2@d? I think that W hand makes up in playing strength and controls what it lacks in high cards|pg||
nt|chick: E may not be sure if 5@C is a slam try, lead directing, or offer of another place to play|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcomyn: well he cant like the S suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: even after the lead-directing 1@d opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: that lead lookds costly but actually there is always one dim loser|pg||
nt|chick: fortunately, his 5@H bid is right in all those cases|pg||
pc|c2|nt|james_h: a try scored ... now for the crutial conversion|pg||

nt|ciaran: Good morning all|pg||
nt|james_h: Is Selway a sponsor? can anyone tell me?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a pushy game but it makes as long as he kicks straight. That would be a real positive start|pg||
nt|james_h: Played with Espen Erichsen many years ago in the TGR|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi Ciaran. An all-Irish team bedad|pg||

pc|c8|nt|jferg: they were very unlucky in our trials finishing third 1 vp behind second|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|lestergold: together with a club and two spads unless the defence carve up|pg||
nt|jallerton: possible endplay vs N|pg||
nt|lestergold: three qs equally 6 questionable points not really enuf for game opposite a strong nt|pg||
nt|jallerton: small club from dummy, what can North do?|pg||
nt|lestergold: north has to duck but may well not|pg||
nt|lestergold: i still say that south should hav ebid 2c- if nothing else it would have hlped the defence bhere|pg||
nt|jallerton: they may not play 2@c as natural here|pg||
nt|lestergold: that would explain things|pg||
nt|jallerton: quite a few pairs play it as some major suit take-out|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate east seems to be a long time in the tank|pg||
nt|henryb: whatever it is with no aces East can only bid 5@h|pg||

nt|marlowepi: high offense-to-defense ratio. nothing matters on this deal, of course|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think you can afford jump raises when not vulnerable, but should avoid vul or min|pg||

nt|mariner1: and with E having only 1@S there is no threat of a @c ruff now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Also as E has shown @hAK|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cindy: right but N should be willing to play 2S  not to go to 3 level though|pg||
nt|ciaran: if hearts are raised, you can try NT next|pg||

nt|jallerton: No|pg||
nt|ciaran: Though a minute ago, I didn't think there was a 5th trick either|pg||
nt|jallerton: EBU gained by bidding the thin game on board 1.  Ireland played in 3@s =|pg||
nt|mariner1: that looks awfully flat|pg||

mb|d|an|17+|mb|p|an|3+!D|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: This is the 2@C opener that I saw earlier, when I was in the Open Room. Not a strong part of the system to have to open at the two-level on such a feeble suit.|pg||

nt|werge: You @had! then at the 2-level, DOUBLED|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the other table West had a forcing 2NT available over 2@S, which is not part of the standard Precision system and did not show the five hearts either.|pg||
nt|werge: had|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: West is overbidding. He knows that his hearts face a shortage.|pg||

pc|c2|nt|werge: Strange claim-result?|pg||
nt|brolucius: In 3NT at the other table, North led the @D9. Short of entries to the table (East), declarer broached the clubs by running  the @C10 from his hand.|pg||

nt|james_h: If you open your windows in Dublin, you should hear Terry quite clearly|pg||
nt|sharkirl: as u say same 10 tricks with some fancy footwork in between|pg||
nt|finch: Jon is going to be very cross about this hand afterwards... even though he took a sensible line|pg||
nt|mayors: well I Think the welsh are very lucky to have defeated this|pg||
nt|mowen: so A@D beat the contract|pg||
nt|finch: with the very favourable club lie, 4@H can be made on any lead here|pg||
nt|mowen: if west played low what would he have done?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Cooke looks a bit happier now|pg||
nt|eamongall: panic kind of set in and the defence remained with its best source of tricks in tact at the end |pg||
nt|ppiglett: I'd say|pg||
nt|viren169: Np as 3@S was brought home safely!|pg||
nt|viren169: Nice hand now...|pg||
nt|mowen: for who?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: Joking of course|pg||
nt|othered1: Well, EW didn't get a chance to be bullied into a bad-scoring red spot.|pg||
nt|mariner1: no slam EW though they could end up in one............|pg||
mb|2S|an|sp + minor|nt|jferg: east needs to find a club lead against 3nt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this one is tough, can not stayman and show diamonds unless playing 2 way stayman|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@c multi-way|pg||
nt|mayors: 1@s 5+ hearts|pg||
nt|finch: when he won the spade switch in hand, he was clearly planning to take the diamond fineese|pg||
nt|othered1: unlucky @S and @C positions could even beat 4@S, if east goes wrong|pg||
nt|ralfwil: missing two aces (@dA and @sK), so probably no slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: no u are right I heard him|pg||
nt|viren169: fancy footwork to keep us entertained!|pg||
nt|jallerton: 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@D by E/W|pg||
nt|viren169: they should reach game now!|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS have a rare VUL save in 5@D over 4@S or 5@C... but that might shove NS|pg||
nt|mariner1: higher to a losing spot|pg||
mb|2N|nt|cindy: think he will after S shows hearts|pg||
nt|jferg: think he will t/fer to dias|pg||
nt|cindy: he shouldnt txf to diamonds|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like 2@H should go two down|pg||
nt|mowen: 2@c precision style, no hesitation from Norman showing longer suit...lucky him|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: n/s can probably make 5c with trhe very favourable heart position|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@S now|pg||
mb|3C|nt|james_h: I like the way Terry discarded the notion of a 4-4 spade fit and proceeded with Diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: good pass by N...keep N/S safe from going minus!|pg||
nt|mowen: is the system designed for confusion or is there constructive reasons|pg||
nt|finch: 2@D is a good heart raise, at least INV; 2@S showed a maximum (possibly a slightly optimistic maximum)|pg||
nt|finch: maximum in the context of not opening a strong club|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good decision to bid here - looks like defense will beat 1N|pg||
nt|ciaran: Must show 4/4 and a max?|pg||
nt|jallerton: What does Stayman mean in Ireland?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: think Carroll said "both M" but not sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: (for 3@c)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes it shows both|pg||
nt|jallerton: In most of the world, 2@d, 2@h and 2@s are the only permitted responses|pg||
nt|ianrei: and now they're too high|pg||
nt|jallerton: In case West has a hand like his actual one and wants to pass any response|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: border line between pass and 1NT in my book|pg||
nt|sharkirl: I would pass |pg||
nt|sharkirl: and be happy to come in later if necessary|pg||
nt|sharkirl: they are playing 4-card Majors|pg||
nt|jcomyn: getting a bit highwith a 6-count|pg||
nt|viren169: wow!!!!!!!!|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jferg: i think they play non promisery stayman|pg||
nt|jcomyn: coming|pg||
nt|finch: The system does have theoretical merit|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3@S looks like 9 or 10 as card lie|pg||
mb|p|nt|VugraphPL1: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/2009/krajowe/gpp/01elblag/emax.html|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well regardless of suit lengths and quality, i think double is pretty dangerous unless you have the specific agreement that if you bid a major over partners 1D advance of your ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double, you show no extra values. i think few pairs have that agreement|pg||
nt|jallerton: May be on unsure gorund here.  How strong is 3@c?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: a practical auction|pg||
nt|fabsayc: east should find club lead, infering hearts in dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: i feel south should bid 5c now|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n has play but very uncomfortable|pg||
nt|finch: you get a lot more room after the 1@H opening (showing 4+ spades) to sort out the shapes|pg||
nt|mowen: sounds fun!!??|pg||
nt|finch: the system includes a 2@C opening with both majors, reducing the problems of finding a fit in the other major|pg||
nt|eamongall: the bridge correspondant of the Sunday Independant indicates Ireland can win the Senior Camrose this year |pg||
nt|viren169: Norman is on the go-faster stripes stuff!|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: this is all wrong|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 1H by E 2D by S|pg||
nt|finch: so the 1M openings don't have the other major unless they are max, or 6-4|pg||
nt|finch: Another trump lead, another hand where I wouldn't have led a trump.... this time it makes no different, however|pg||
nt|othered1: Again, east will have to play @S suit right in 5@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: just to hard for NS to come in VUL vs NV|pg||
nt|othered1: if @D lead|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cindy: is W supposed to throw the J here with Jxxx ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: not an attractive lead vs 3NT as West (if that becomes the final contract)|pg||
nt|ciaran: Trump lead would hold this to 6 or 7 tricks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|paulg: i'd have been slightly nervous as South until dummy came down|pg||
nt|cindy: i agree and if i double and partner bids diamonds, thats where i have to play|pg||
nt|barbyh: but the danger is you lose your other suit|pg||
nt|cindy: so thats why i dont like double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some of us only have one suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: well that lead has improved the prospects|pg||
nt|mowen: how do they find the time to invent and practise|pg||
nt|viren169: the dble slowed him down...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cindy: and does this mean W does not have the J ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if NS play that stayman followed by a 2NT rebid over 2S does not promise 4 hearts, that might be a tactically better way to bid the S hand, which in any case is aceless. he can ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trust N to go on most of the time when  he should|pg||
nt|jferg: if they play rev att he will conyinue|pg||
nt|cindy: operator tells me the Q asks for attitude|pg||
nt|finch: they play a huge amount online on BBO|pg||
nt|ciaran: This should be beaten - defense have several chances to find the spade ruff|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@d was presumably a retransfer|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Trump lead shouts out - heart shortage known in dummy and looking at heart length|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|james_h: Derek didnt fly all that way to pass|pg||
nt|jcomyn: strange bid by Terry with singleton D - could be very dangerous|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he'd ate you James if u did that|pg||
nt|james_h: He has to make an effort opposite a Vul Overcall and he has a reasonable hand|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Is Mr C offering odds?|pg||
nt|mowen: hmm, B'wood no help here with such length between them...and a stiff in 3 suits:)|pg||
nt|othered1: That 2@S opening did the job.  If pass, south might try a 3rd seat 2@D (if available) and that might set north off when EW compete|pg||
nt|mariner1: even with @c lead and ruff that would have probably forced E to play @SA and one|pg||
nt|mariner1: to make|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c2|nt|lestergold: well 3n is there for then taking as the cards lie|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: cant throw jack, partner might underlead and block suit|pg||
nt|mowen: you would lead a @D?|pg||
nt|finch: yes|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|cindy: well i know that|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ciaran: the clublead has given declarer a quick re-entry to hand for a second heart ruff|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|viren169: some specs think it is dangerous to pass... |pg||
nt|viren169: It is close...|pg||
nt|mayors: I would also lead a @d|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|jallerton: N's peter in trumps may be suit preference|pg||
nt|ciaran: even if Garey guesses trumps, Howard should find the switch knowing declarer has 4@S|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cindy: my question was related to their methods|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, regardless of their agreements, W should try to play a card in tempo. otherwiuse there might be a problem|pg||
nt|ciaran: shows what i know!  much easier looking at all four hands|pg||
nt|ppiglett: absolutely|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice play!|pg||
nt|othered1: That did the job in @S. well done|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|finch: I tend to make aggressive leads against this type of power auction.  Makes the defence easier later|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cindy: i said i prefer overcall unless on the rare exception when the 4 card suit is MUCH better than the 5 card suit|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jallerton: 5@c would also make |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mowen: I'd have xx and waited to see if pard found something useful...|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ciaran: Declarer has done very well to get trumps right|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkirl: and vul v non-vul, why stick ur neck out?|pg||
nt|viren169: +80 is likley to create a small swing with only 7 tricks available.|pg||
nt|jallerton: S knows N has 2 spades, but does he know about the ace?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: and east has set up the ninth trick but what could he do|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ianrei: strange anti percentage play in H|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: even then i would overcall rather than double. but i would overcall the four-card suit instead of the five:   xxxxx  AKQx  xx Ax|pg||
nt|paulg: a slightly soft defence, but only overtricks|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|finch: either the lead works well or you've let the contract through... I think the former happens more often than the latter|pg||
nt|mowen: I am in the minority in avoiding leading from kings against suits|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcomyn: think 5D is now out|pg||
nt|ciaran: First outing in the Camrose for Derek O'Gorman and Terry Walsh this weekend|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5c infrangible |pg||
nt|jallerton: E limited by his failure to open a strong @c|pg||
mb|4S|nt|viren169: 4@S by E/W will be hard to reach...|pg||
nt|lestergold: so is 3n of course but a silly looking contract|pg||
nt|mayors: marginal save but north is flat with QTx @s so they probably wont find|pg||
nt|finch: Agreed it's marginal.  It's worth bidding 5@C on this type of hand because sometimes they bid 5@S and go off|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2NT may be a good club raise |pg||
nt|ciaran: There was a bigger score than 4H on offer there!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Cooke & O'Gorman checking the clock|pg||
nt|viren169: England are well behind in the match... maybe that is why we are seeing some interesting bidding going on?!?!?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: lots of values in this hand, but no big fit |pg||

nt|paulg: 2@s or 3@c|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 2nt gets my ugly award of the day|pg||

nt|jcomyn: well thats brave|pg||
nt|james_h: My My Derek is getting giggy with it ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this will be some effort if they get there|pg||
nt|ciaran: well, hard to see more than one quick loser in @D, though 12 tricks not be possible|pg||
nt|james_h: Terry with drive it home now|pg||
nt|mowen: 4@S is off if clubs are 2-2|pg||
nt|finch: The double of 4@C must be very pure take-out, he's not going to be happy if partner passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: presuming both are forcing|pg||
nt|viren169: Now if East has a way of playing in 3@S... Will he take it?|pg||
nt|finch: not if spades are 2-2 as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: 2-2, 2 if you like|pg||
nt|mowen: true|pg||
pc|s9|nt|cindy: that spade suit is pretty good|pg||
nt|cindy: now he hasnt shown his good spades or his club fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if the reverse is not GF, it should certainly promise another call, so i think N ought to be bidding a black suit over 2H|pg||
nt|cindy: what is this auction ?|pg||
nt|sharkirl: on the last board in the other room they are now in 4@H v the 1@S here|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: wasn't alerted though|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|paulg: their convention card is pretty convention-free, so may be 3@c is non-forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the 3D call really put N in the soup|pg||
nt|paulg: now forced to bid 4@c, i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if that is so, then N can bid 2S, which is surely forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: what kind of bidding is this?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What is 2NT?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: primitive?|pg||
nt|cindy: thats what i was wondering|pg||
nt|jferg: normal i guess|pg||
nt|cindy: 2N and 5C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2NT is normal?|pg||
nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|jferg: souths diamond maybe as few as one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so ugly and bizarre on same hand|pg||
nt|cindy: even more reason to bid hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes, and what would 1@H show as response to 1@D?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Derek is beginning to sweat I can see it on his furrowed brow|pg||
nt|ianrei: what was the X of 2NT ?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Tonking wasn't that productive the last time!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: 80 min or so left|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@D shows 6-4?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cindy: play 3C nonforcing doesnt seem like a good use of methods|pg||
nt|lestergold: iif the defence cashed 4h and a club then this would be shown up as a silly contract but here it rolls in due to the heart blockage|pg||
nt|mayors: I think north has too much stuff to expect a 5 level adventure from EW, especially on this semi scrambling auction|pg||
nt|mowen: S&D have coped well|pg||
nt|finch: I agree.  South had a pretty solid weak jump compared to what he could have had (e.g. 1336 opposite is 800)|pg||
nt|petepunt: too many values in @D is appears|pg||
nt|henryb: only three top losers (well 4 because can't set up a @c) but I expect two down|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Townsend giving a lot of thought to his lead|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ianrei: 3NT is ok, to go off you need the C finesse to lose and they cash 4H|pg||
nt|ianrei: the right line in 5C isn't clear|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but 5c is a better contract and bears more resmblance to bridge as well|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, they can't cash _five_ hearts straight away v 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i do not regard 5hearts to the j opposite a void as a v ery adequate stopper |pg||
nt|jallerton: doubling a natural 2NT seems a bit risky on E with no club trick|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good position for EBU here as 3H makes|pg||
nt|ianrei: 2NT had 8 on top|pg||
nt|ianrei: even 3NT might make|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: mebbe N meant good raise and alerted as such?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: he's the other side of screen|pg||
nt|jallerton: I think Andy likes to play 2NT as natural where possible - but here there is no other call available below 3@c to show a good raise|pg||
nt|ianrei: I expect N/S play 2NT as a raise - John usually does|pg||
nt|ciaran: Slightly surprising result on board 3 in the other room if correct.|pg||
nt|ianrei: andy took some time to bid 2NT (assuming we saw the actual tempo)|pg||
nt|ianrei: if it was a raise would have been obvious|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: took time waiting for tray to come back after 2H so both 2NT and X may have taken time|pg||
nt|henryb: I tould lead a trump with those @s|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sharkirl: that was the danger of bidding 1NT vul|pg||
nt|sharkirl: well bid on  this|pg||
nt|finch: Yes, once the double of 4@C wasn't passed, East could show spades and diamonds, choice of games|pg||
nt|ciaran: Not obvious to double with no trump trick in either hand|pg||
nt|petepunt: prob same effect as e can;t continue @H|pg||
nt|othered1: Has SA Texas (minors transferring to majors) become standard, rather than suit under?  I play that, but it seems uncommon in USA.  See it much more frequently online.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jcomyn: Yowza|pg||
nt|sharkirl: and a pressure lead|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer wont be too happy at the start but will come out well as the hand is played out...|pg||
nt|viren169: great lead...|pg||
nt|viren169: prefer a simple 3@H|pg||
pc|cA|nt|finch: If you want to see more of Cooke & Garvey in action, they frequently play late night teams matches|pg||
nt|mowen: 5@D seems a little cowardly|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|finch: look for mugsmate and TheGarve|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jcomyn: this comes home it will surely rattle the opps|pg||
pc|c4|nt|viren169: another slam missed!|pg||
nt|mowen: so down in a game when 6NT is decent|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|paulg: it looks like you have to play the club suit for one loser whereever you end up|pg||
nt|mariner1: board 3, the 4@S DBL making ended in 5@H DBL East in Open|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think this is the BMUS system|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ralfwil: and 2 a IMPs loss when they let NS play 2@d|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: the real problem is that despite the array of HCP, N does not have such a fasbulously fitting hand that he should be eager to wait until the 4 level to show his fit.|pg||
nt|barbyh: no problem here|pg||
nt|paulg: well there is the trump suit to play|pg||
nt|barbyh: no problem|pg||
nt|cindy: no problem but not a good contract either|pg||
nt|barbyh: d is on and clubs are favorable|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pretty grotty slam. is it that clear to find the winning play in trumps?|pg||
nt|barbyh: how else wd you play it?|pg||
nt|cindy: how can he go wrong ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well he has a very good idea where everything is|pg||
nt|ciaran: Even with the friendly break in clubs and diamonds, might need a heart guess here?|pg||
nt|viren169: another swing...|pg||
nt|mowen: denning never got to show his good values|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: clubs are not so favorable if you start with a small opne from hand|pg||
nt|cindy: could even lead Q from dummy|pg||
nt|barbyh: if the kings not on side j10 fropping is great|pg||
nt|paulg: you don't have many entries to dummy|pg||
nt|paulg: so club to the @cQ and @ck, then finesse on the return to pick up 4-1 clubs |pg||
nt|ppiglett: And with 6 good spades and heart sup|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|cindy: beavis ?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|nt|fabsayc: well it worked sort of|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "Beam Me Up, Scotty"|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can still beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @CA and another|pg||
nt|cindy: iwould be afraid i would never be able to get another partner if i bid that way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you might have to emigrate then cindy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you can;t bowl that slow in this crowd, cindy|pg||
nt|cindy: to ireland ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sime should be able to solve this defense|pg||
nt|jferg: more than welcome wonderful country|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well done Derek|pg||
nt|ciaran: Very well done|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c7|pg||
nt|henryb: ten tricks now|pg||
nt|petepunt: whoops a googly in cricket terms|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcomyn: home free now|pg||
nt|jallerton: I've known worse "stoppers"|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sharkirl: still under pressure|pg||
nt|jallerton: often most of the time on the other side of the screen is taken up with explanations!|pg||
nt|othered1: And indeed west here made good decision to go for 590 on board 3.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|henryb: one of the points of a trump lead is that it suggests control of dummy's second suit. |pg||
nt|henryb: So partner will be less tempted to duck the @s|pg||
nt|petepunt: very true,  he did give it a lot of thought too.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|mariner1: so board 3 was 11 imps to OS.se allowing the 4@S DBL|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as we were agreed here in CR, that pass was the best|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sharkirl: needs @S finesse|pg||
nt|henryb: the other point is to cut down on ruffs!|pg||
nt|petepunt: also no @H overcall by S so likely only 4 yet he jumped to 4@H|pg||
nt|petepunt: wont hold aQ@S surely ?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: well, it is easy enough to see that the club suit comes in when we see all the cards. if not i think there is a fair case for starting with a small one|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you start small, then PRC is going to say finesse next time|pg||
nt|ciaran: Doesn' look to be any losing option, but he has a choice whether to pay for @H or @C to break|pg||
nt|ciaran: Can he combine chances?|pg||
nt|viren169: Specs are asking for their money back... can only get better!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|henryb: if he ruffs high, down he will go|pg||
nt|mowen: perhaps he should have raised the 4th suit to show a max of this type of shape|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d6|nt|viren169: not anymore...|pg||
nt|viren169: all routes led to success...|pg||
nt|viren169: not clear where playing the A or small is best at trick 1|pg||
nt|othered1: I agreed that pass was best on hand, but not sure I would have found it myself.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jferg: maybe emigrate to scotland:  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: can;t blame E for heart lead. need to lead best suit on such auctions & from his hand it seems hearts is most likely weak spot when they eschew 3NT. of course, in a sequence like ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this, who knows?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|paulg: i guess there is a slight chance of a diamond ruff in the air|pg||
nt|paulg: but 4-1 clubs more likely than 6-1 diamonds|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he is  not taking any risk|pg||
nt|henryb: now claim on a high crossruff|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|petepunt: Dafydd (son of Gary) Jones|pg||
nt|henryb: and here I was hoping son of Tom|pg||
nt|henryb: :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkirl: percentage to play Q as they are playing 3rd and 5th leads|pg||
nt|jallerton: I've just found it their system file: 2NT was a good raise!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk4: Oh dear|pg||
nt|cindy: what is going on here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Comedy of errors|pg||

nt|cindy: ok marshall  i agree if you start with low club to dummy  then should hook on way back|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too|pg||
nt|cindy: theyve been opening 1N on this hand|pg||
nt|viren169: still had to rely on clubs at the end...|pg||
nt|viren169: best to duck at trick one I think|pg||
nt|finch: Playing less serious bridge, Cooke would usually open the South hand|pg||
nt|viren169: What about 3@H?|pg||
nt|mowen: still if 5@D is the worst contract they reach they will do well|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: and they apparently do not play texas after 2H|pg||
nt|sharkirl: yes|pg||
nt|mowen: really?|pg||
nt|finch: Interesting to see how conservative he is playing in the Camrose!|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Good competitive hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: yet another 4@S here|pg||
mb|1C!|an|twoway  11-13NT or any 17+|nt|marlowepi: the question is what is the percxentage way to start the suit|pg||
nt|paulg: i would definitely double with the north hand|pg||
nt|cindy: dont know   havent had enough mountain dew to figure that out yet|pg||
nt|jferg: you can log onto bgb for system sheets|pg||
nt|cindy: no i cant   im on desktop that is like an old dinosaur|pg||
nt|Walddk4: the pc has been invented, Cindy|pg||
nt|viren169: nice competitive hand here|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT = 14+- to 17|pg||
nt|finch: if West hadn't opened, NS might have ben in danger of getting too high|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@c = natural or 11-14 balanced|pg||
nt|jallerton: Not a good advertisement for this method|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: yuck!|pg||
nt|ianrei: at least he  has a 3rd C |pg||
nt|ciaran: Might keep E quiet?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like 1N will make N/S and 2M E/W|pg||
nt|ciaran: 5H for E/W and looks like 4S will go one down|pg||
nt|ciaran: Gooke/Garvey's system is here: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/systems/cooke-garvey.pdf|pg||
nt|othered1: And a 5@C save that's OK, even with the trump stack|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW might reach 5@C|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|cindy: i would definitely not double with that hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as opposed to new dinosaurs?|pg||
nt|cindy: i know   im better at using psychic powers|pg||
nt|viren169: 5@D for N/S|pg||
nt|finch: I doubt they'll look for a slam now|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT loses 4@s 1@H 2@c|pg||
nt|ppiglett: 2 down with perfect def - diamond ruffs and underleading H|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: you only have one bid opposite a passed hand, so get both majors into play (is my philosophy)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, i would probably overcall, but it is a better double trhan the other hand because you have club tolerance|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a 2C part score - take a short break|pg||
nt|viren169: off on a heart ruff|pg||
nt|mowen: hope south bids now|pg||
nt|jallerton: on the normal @slead|pg||
nt|ciaran: normal if W on lead, yes|pg||
nt|viren169: 3NT E/W way here...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But E told about a rather balanced hand, so pass is not so far away|pg||
mb|d|an|t/o w 17+|nt|cindy: they are bidding and cant stop|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They bid as if they had something|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually you can use texas and 4@S to distinguish shapes or strengths|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why should they go minus when we can?|pg||
nt|ciaran: England gained 6 by staing in partscore on board 3 where Ireland tried 5@D|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@H could get a bit messy|pg||
nt|mayors: oops|pg||
nt|mowen: oh|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@s = no major|pg||
nt|jallerton: Actually, 1@c could also have been any game force, so 1@s doesn't guarantee any values!|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: my partner's don't expect the unbid minor from me, just majors|pg||
nt|cindy: yeh but what happens is you double and partner bids clubs and then you are stuck|pg||
nt|jallerton: This needs some care|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a dull and infrangible 3n|pg||
nt|ianrei: play on D or C?|pg||
nt|jallerton: best to duck the first trick|pg||
nt|jallerton: then play @c|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ianrei: if you set up 4D tricks you still only have 7 tricks|pg||
mb|2C|nt|cindy: whats even worse is when your partner bids clubs and they double|pg||
nt|jallerton: as can then finesse @d into the safe hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry maybe not infrangible|pg||
nt|henryb: not me. I pass a 15-17 1NT with East|pg||
nt|othered1: I would have acted with south's hand over 1@D (2@D)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharkirl: and they don't want to be in 5 |pg||
nt|sharkirl: opening 4@S would have worked better on this hand|pg||
nt|mowen: in the books it says make a simple overcall as it won't be passed out - wrong|pg||
nt|mowen: i think Jon should respond to a 2 level overcall|pg||
nt|mayors: I'm going to have to leave you now.  Enjoy the rest of the show.|pg||
nt|mowen: bye|pg||
nt|finch: Thanks very much Graham|pg||
nt|jallerton: interesting|pg||
nt|ciaran: all systems are available here:|pg||
nt|ciaran: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|ciaran: Yes indeed Peter|pg||
mb|4C|nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but 5D was possible|pg||
nt|viren169: Now 4@S dbled minus 1|pg||
mb|4S|nt|paulg: seem to be a little short of tricks here|pg||
nt|eamongall: 5@Hs has taken a turn for the better|pg||
mb|5C|nt|marlowepi: well, i am not that worried about them doubling 2C, or of being set much if they do|pg||
nt|paulg: although every action looks reasonable|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and if it is a partscore hand there is not a lot at stake either|pg||
nt|paulg: that is, reasonable in the context of everyone overbidding in the modern game|pg||
nt|cindy: it certainly could be if you are doubled vul going down when you can make hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a widespread philosophy aparently|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we have moved to neputian bidding now, way out|pg||
nt|cindy: have these people had dinner yet ?|pg||
nt|viren169: seems the par result...|pg||
nt|petepunt: neither can sing :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: would make if played by S on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|mayors: I would try 2NT with the south cards|pg||
nt|ciaran: East displays the magic dummy|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Goo d new for dec at trick one|pg||
nt|chick: as do I ... balanced 8 usually isn't enough|pg||
nt|viren169: Cards well placed for declarer... especially on a @H lead!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: Good lead from Erichsen. |pg||
nt|mowen: hard to see a swing on this|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzkp: table amused by dummy's singleton|pg||
nt|henryb: and a balanced 8 opposite 15 often goes down in 2N|pg||
nt|chick: he does have a play for this, endplaying N|pg||
nt|petepunt: agree with pass,  especially as opps may come back in vuln|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: ponder..ponder|pg||
nt|petepunt: small @D |pg||
nt|petepunt: what else can he play|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcomyn: wont 2H make here for EW|pg||
nt|ciaran: Even 3H looks possible with a good guess in H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: seems England in game only on the slam hand|pg||
nt|mayors: @C K is big card|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: half-time announcement made|pg||
nt|viren169: I agree..|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|viren169: Declarer will come to 9 tricks one way or another...|pg||
nt|mariner1: another quick hand|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he plays club now then should make as east is hoist between two stools either set up hearts butc west never gets in or plays spade and sets up ninth trick for declarer|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcomyn: cant see Carvey allowing 2C to go free|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting 2@S bid by South|pg||
nt|lestergold: now can safely finesse dim to east|pg||
nt|mayors: bye all|pg||
nt|mowen: Jon will be surprised when 11 tricks are claimed|pg||
nt|petepunt: the end play looms now|pg||
nt|henryb: Ace and a @d|pg||
nt|petepunt: but may simply play S for q@H|pg||
nt|petepunt: gr8 hand |pg||
nt|henryb: he has 2@d, 3@c and 2@s|pg||
pc|h3|nt|finch: Their convention card says taht 2NT would have been hearts and clubs, so I'm a bit surprised he didn't do that|pg||
nt|eamongall: or was it always making |pg||
nt|othered1: is east always making 4@S, with, say, @H lead?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|cindy: this match was close and then  ....|pg||
nt|ciaran: Since N/S play 4th best leads and N denied a major, declarer knows a lot about the layout|pg||
nt|ianrei: should make 9 tricks now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: amazing that so far in thios set of deals the score is 1-to-1|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|viren169: Need a flat board to calm the nerves!|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ciaran: The @DQ at trick one was revealing too|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: true enough, but 1H could lose spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 40 imps could have changed hands|pg||
nt|cindy: marshall quit reading my mind|pg||
nt|mariner1: the Open is catching up with us|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcomyn: mm 23-6 good start for holders|pg||
nt|viren169: any ideas what that showed?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ciaran: I think declarer needs to take teh ruffing finesse in spades to make|pg||
pc|sA|nt|paulg: Murdoch goes for the only chance by rising with the @cQ, but it will probably cost another undertrick|pg||
nt|sharkirl: quality of @H suit probably stopped a 4@H response|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not to worry, shortcircuit after 12 seconds|pg||
nt|petepunt: brd 5 was very int in O-room|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: I assure you all, there is a lot of thought going into this|pg||
nt|henryb: Wales' hope in the other match of interest is fading as EBU is ahead 20-4|pg||
nt|viren169: Some of the specs have said last two hands! Maybe they will change their minds!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|ciaran: surprising that W covered|pg||
nt|jcomyn: home now|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3rd is the realistic target for Wales THIS year|pg||
nt|chick: N's turn to think|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: exactly|pg||
nt|henryb: should have been thinking while Townsend thought.|pg||
nt|henryb: and be ready to play now|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|paulg: 4@s will be keycard, and 5@d shows 2 of the 5 aces without the @hQ|pg||
nt|cindy: why do those passes keep getting alerted ?  :)   cause S really wants to bid ?|pg||
nt|paulg: Liz, our operator, is trying to alert the previous call|pg||
nt|paulg: but the bbo software is not quite as intuitive as you'd like (as an operator)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5-4-2-2?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Do you agree with S's pass over 1@h?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: see i thought it was super intuitive, knowing S really wanted to bid|pg||
nt|paulg: (that is, if you are using the keyboard rather than mouse to enter bids, alerts, etc)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: be delighted shortly stayed low|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like this will play well for declarer |pg||
nt|henryb: or defender|pg||
nt|viren169: another light opener by West has kept N/S quiet...|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Good start for defense|pg||
nt|othered1: That was quick.  Guess south didn't go looking for miracle 7-counts|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: good start|pg||
nt|ianrei: whats else - 1NT doesnt appeal|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is fixed|pg||
nt|viren169: just as well they will be saying!|pg||
nt|mowen: Erichsen's opening has killed the competition by bidding their suit|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure I'd be happy to put dummy down!|pg||
nt|othered1: such as @HK and @Sxx and @CK|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mowen: middle from 5 small - strange|pg||
nt|mowen: game with 11 opposite 12 but tough to beat|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ianrei: 2S doesnt seem to have much more that 6 tricks|pg||
nt|mowen: all over now as there is no way to get 4 spades and A@H|pg||
nt|viren169: spade and a diamond switch may have done it...|pg||
nt|viren169: not easy... we can see all 4 hands! |pg||
nt|viren169: And even then we are sometimes wrong.|pg||
nt|mowen: the best chance for the defence was a passive lead - say a club|pg||
nt|viren169: ducking may take Declarer of the scent!|pg||
nt|viren169: Espen doesnt miss much...|pg||
nt|viren169: except when he is playing golf!|pg||
nt|mowen: has to play A@H  as partner might have 5 good hearts|pg||
nt|viren169: then he is looking forever!|pg||
nt|mowen: the @HJ would have been better as south could duck his ace|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: not strong enuf especially with oly Ax spade to overcqll 1n|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ppiglett: Gotta go - bye all|pg||
nt|eamongall: bye|pg||
nt|eamongall: golf ? |pg||
nt|ppiglett: Birthday lunch|pg||
pc|h9|nt|eamongall: are you 48 today |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @s8 must be right!|pg||
nt|othered1: In a system that can start strong hands relatively low, I wonder why south didnt' take advantage of the system to sniff around for slam?|pg||
nt|mariner1: right for what?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: to play on the first lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc09/fc_main_en.htm  -|pg||
nt|mariner1: Tournament Site|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d4|nt|jallerton: There is a school of thought that 4th hand should overcall 1NT a lot more freely these days|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
nt|ianrei: and the Hs are likely to be losers|pg||
nt|finch: the lead wasn't systemic|pg||
nt|henryb: I do not know whether South actually huddled before playing from 10x of @h, If he did, he should not have.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|jallerton: on the basis that people open and resond very light|pg||
nt|ianrei: thats becase people open and respond on such rubbish|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcomyn: H 4-1 and both finesses wrong in minors - you might feel hard done by|pg||
nt|lestergold: you cant bid what you havent got because you hopethe oppos havent got what theyc say they have !|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its not generally winning bridge in my experience|pg||
nt|ianrei: declarer should guess this|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for two reasons. so partner can play another @s and must not guess his next play|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|finch: With the @D10 short, this will make 9 tricks fairly easily|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jcomyn: oh no finesse in D only C|pg||
nt|viren169: diamond ducked would have worked better |pg||
pc|s7|nt|paulg: I can see Liz is catching up, because Brian Spears NEVER plays this fast :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ten of D lead has a good chance of success|pg||
nt|cindy: he drank my mountain dew|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to find based on the bidding...|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: No...South played in tempo on that trick|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ianrei: now he can score a club ruff|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: 7 tricks that is|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mariner1: and making 5|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh hes gone for perhaps the superior play of seting up a club trick o two|pg||
mc|11|nt|henryb: I think declarer will now get the @s right, as Townsend almost must have the !q for his opening|pg||
nt|mariner1: W could have led the Q@S when in with trump......as they held the 9@S too|pg||

nt|mowen: so the 2@C opener turns up|pg||
nt|finch: 2@C 8-13 with both majors|pg||
nt|finch: if it's maximum, it can be 4-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|finch: 2@D inv+ relay|pg||
nt|ciaran: West looks more like a 1N overcall assuming that is natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: still 24 brds to play but exciting times fr eng 1 and eng 2 i suspect|pg||
mb|3N|nt|viren169: perhaps it does!|pg||
nt|sharkirl: prefer 3@S now from N|pg||
nt|viren169: some form of ghestem|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@c 4-4 majors|pg||
nt|ianrei: 11 easy trcks in H|pg||
nt|finch: 3@H shows 5=4=3=1 max|pg||
nt|finch: he could have bid 3@S 5-5 max, but this way he shows the diamonds as well|pg||
nt|petepunt: can they avoide 6@S now|pg||
nt|finch: well, Blackwood will avoid 6@S if nothing else will|pg||
mb|p|nt|mowen: blackwood|pg||
nt|finch: 4@D is RKCB in spades|pg||
nt|petepunt: b;wood in what suit|pg||
nt|finch: 4@C would have been rkcb in hearts|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@h 3-suiter with short diamonds, 11-15|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: pass terry|pg||
nt|ciaran: Very tough to beat 3NT here|pg||
nt|viren169: A bit passive by N/S|pg||
nt|finch: garvey deciding whether to show the void or not (and if so, how to)|pg||
nt|petepunt: 5@S is in danger|pg||
nt|finch: West will do well to find the ace of diamonds lead, but we don't know yet who will be declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: very much so|pg||
nt|viren169: now it is all about overtricks!|pg||
nt|othered1: Guess west is stuck for a bid in their system, 'cause a natural 2N wouldn't have occurred to me with those @S|pg||
nt|othered1: morth won't find @S lead, so positioning hand in west may be good.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|paulg: well done for keeping up!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well done, wrong sided contract|pg||
nt|jferg: the contract might not have been as attractive if east did not have the dia q|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but would E bid 4H with:   Jxxxx  x   Qxx  KQxx ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he cant though can he?|pg||
nt|ianrei: 3NT shaky on S lead but ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n would be a very poor spot altho it make here because of fortunate layout|pg||
nt|mariner1: lead helps a little here,,,,,,,, @D lead is trouble for EW|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ianrei: even with 30 points the 4-4 fit is better|pg||
pc|c9|nt|finch: 4NT two key cards without the queen of spades|pg||
nt|finch: pass = I do have clubs stopped quite well|pg||
nt|finch: good effort to stop in 4NT|pg||
nt|mowen: super sequence|pg||
nt|viren169: Welcome back!|pg||
nt|othered1: That should help west, but not playing !J may cost timing|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|petepunt: they need quick def tricks so a@D poss|pg||
nt|jallerton: Interesting trump lead from Qxx|pg||
nt|mariner1: the trick is are there 9 before giving up 5|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, on several rational lines of play as cards lie|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like playing on @d is better than on @s A on side|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he is lucky that long @S does not also have A@D|pg||
nt|othered1: understandable that west is taking time on this.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: My reason is that the @d suit is covering more distributions|pg||
nt|othered1: could even come down to the position of the @D10 on some lines/lies|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ciaran: Even with the club wrong, N/S have 5C, 2S and 2H|pg||
nt|eamongall: 4333 8 count opposite strong NT ....hardly bids game |pg||
nt|eamongall: but maybe the opening bid in North tips the chances of making game in 3NT|pg||
pc|s2|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jferg: up with the heart ace and drive out the spade|pg||
nt|eamongall: however getting out the TONK tool for 2@Hs looks a good idea|pg||
nt|ciaran: cartainly can be made if you are in it and if you're going to play a 3 level contract..|pg||
pc|s5|nt|viren169: looks like +2|pg||
nt|petepunt: but, well stopped in last making contract:)|pg||
nt|othered1: he'll go after @S|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|mowen: hi again|pg||
nt|viren169: We had a technical problem!|pg||
nt|mowen: so 3NT made on the last board|pg||

nt|cindy: in Boston they were taking samples to DNA test the players|pg||
nt|mowen: and on a good board for England|pg||
nt|mariner1: that @S pitch helped W|pg||
nt|othered1: very good chance that west now knows @S count, plus. |pg||
nt|mariner1: now a @H to hand and a @D to dummy......... not that easy to see|pg||
nt|othered1: No @S bid by south, no 6@S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|paulg: lots of problems with identity theft then?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But dangerous to play another @s. If he returns to the hand and plays another @s, he must duck|pg||
pc|h5|nt|viren169: unlucky not to be all 13 tricks!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: short pause for 'comfort break'|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|cindy: some kind of study to look at how bidding matches up to dna....im serious|pg||
nt|eamongall: however 1@S overcall does not indicate the power in the West hand |pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: West is still OK if he plays @H over then @S, reads the spot and ducks|pg||

nt|mariner1: slam EW here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: nothing to 4s here|pg||
nt|viren169: I think 3@S by North seems normal at that vul... playing 5-card majs |pg||
nt|viren169: another light opener!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mowen: exciting hand - might be plenty of bidding|pg||
nt|finch: so far only five imps changed hands this set (4-1 to england) but a swing is coming on 23|pg||

nt|ciaran: Very good slam here for N/S - no wasted values|pg||
mb|2N!|an|supp, gf|nt|paulg: 2@s is a strong jump shift ... a rare treatment in top level bridge nowadays|pg||

nt|jallerton: 2@d= 5+@h, 9+ HCP|pg||
nt|eamongall: Garvey and Cooke should stroll into this as they are very practiced bidders|pg||
nt|petepunt: @C was 4+ here|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: i like strong jump shifts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 7@d|pg||
nt|mariner1: mirrored minors means only 6 makes|pg||
mb|3C!|an|min|nt|fabsayc: but 2@S was last makeable spot|pg||
nt|cindy: i dont believe in using my bids to improve part scores|pg||
nt|sharkirl: but wud seem obvious on that bidding that p has 5 @Ss|pg||
nt|petepunt: 6@D is a good spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: more useful to use them to get to games and slams|pg||
nt|viren169: another opportunity for slam here for Ireland|pg||
nt|lestergold: even 3d looks like it cannot make but N/S are not far off making 4h|pg||
nt|ianrei: only two losers but lack of entries make life difficlt|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem is the entries needed to the nortyh hand for taking all those winning finesses|pg||
nt|jallerton: but can build a @c trick for a @s pitch just losing 1 trick in each side suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: Maybe forcing dummy stops this plan|pg||
nt|mowen: 3 small clubs is bad|pg||
nt|ianrei: 5C with 3 likely tricks looks risky|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5@c gives EW a decision though|pg||
nt|petepunt: even 6@c|pg||
mb|3D!|an|ask for shortness|nt|ciaran: Can't be beaten, but declarer may sweat before making!|pg||
nt|finch: yes, if partner has club length it's a disaster, if partner has club shortage and extras he will protect|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good decision by Howard.  Even with all his defense, 4H is cold|pg||
nt|ianrei: but 5C goes for 1100 on best defence|pg||
nt|ciaran: Having said that, this could be very expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: yes, that did happen. Immediate 4@h reply!|pg||
nt|ciaran: the commentators curse, eh, Eamon!|pg||
nt|petepunt: 4@D may agree @H here though|pg||

mb|p|nt|jallerton: and West has not doubled|pg||
nt|mariner1: .|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mariner1: oh right, 7@D does make, only 6@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: but can ruff and play @c instead|pg||
nt|petepunt: most roads lead to 2 off|pg||
nt|mowen: Garvey need sto ruff A@C and play K@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i dont believe in weak 2@D bids, especially this weak|pg||
nt|viren169: Norman will be going backwards now at every opportunity!|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: it looks like a book 2D bid if thats what you play|pg||
nt|viren169: well done... short and simple seq...|pg||
nt|james_h: pragmatic 6@c|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N forcing raise and 3@D enquiring,,,,|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In sweden many players show a side suit as a positive response, so this is a possibility to reach 7@d|pg||
nt|mariner1: well no slam leaves door open for San Sac in Open|pg||
nt|ralfwil: unbelieveable!|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|paulg: 4@h has appeal to protect partner's minor suit holdings|pg||
nt|jferg: oops at least one too high|pg||
nt|jallerton: retaining a dummy entry for a major suit lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5@c looking very clever now|pg||
nt|ianrei: Howard judged well |pg||
nt|mariner1: hard to think W would not have bid slam|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: i toh spade switch thast given the contract|pg||
nt|ianrei: thats a friendly switch|pg||
nt|mowen: and Cooke must not ruff it|pg||
nt|finch: the king of diamonds discard may be enough for Cooke not to ruff|pg||
nt|mowen: now north must not rise with A@H|pg||
nt|finch: but against that it's very very very hard not to take the setting trick against a vulnerable game|pg||
nt|finch: sorry I was a trick out, if north ruffs the second club he can't discard the @DK|pg||
nt|mowen: the 2 over game force has allowed the club fit to be found|pg||
nt|viren169: Aceless 9 count? Not good in my book!|pg||
nt|mowen: but will be pass?|pg||
nt|viren169: 1 for the road? this is high enough!|pg||
nt|mowen: easy to see 6@C could be right|pg||
nt|viren169: but not on this hand...|pg||
nt|mowen: add the AorQ of @Cs to east|pg||
nt|viren169: At least Norman didnt bid 3@C over 2D!|pg||
nt|mowen: I think he will bid on|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: time for a bookburning then|pg||
nt|viren169: With a void in pd suit and facing possibly only 4 card @C suit...pass is right!|pg||
nt|mowen: I am wrong again - some decision|pg||
nt|viren169: Well done Espen!|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|lestergold: mullered the defence in one fell swoop|pg||
nt|ianrei: should now make - i think a second D at trick 2 made this impossible|pg||
nt|ianrei: so who should have doubled 5C ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: first failing contract of the day?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: Fahrenheit 451|pg||
nt|james_h: he has run into a bad breal in clubs tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: now ruff dim finesse heart cash ace and play spade and take club finesse losing only a dim and a spade that cost maybe two tricksw that switch|pg||
nt|jallerton: what else could be have done? @d at trick 2 is ruffed, @cQ led|pg||
nt|viren169: Espen has seen some of Norman's bid before!|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|ciaran: Had S ducked that, this would have been interesting|pg||
nt|mowen: why would east bid 3@C on 4cards?|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not sure west's hand is a slam force, but it looks like no try was made.  And that doesn't feel right.  But do they open garbage hands with bad suits?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|cindy: you should write to them|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bettertake that HA soon|pg||
nt|james_h: break|pg||
pc|s2|nt|viren169: no chance of an overtrick.... |pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, South making sure of this|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|petepunt: K@D maybe a bit extravagent ?|pg||
nt|mowen: it was when pard does not have a @D|pg||
nt|mowen: contract is now cold|pg||
nt|finch: yes, if West works out what was going on.  He might after drawing trumps and a heart up.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: should have forced duumy to ruff then declarer can take heart finesse and has nine tricks but could still be playing next week for the tenth|pg||
nt|eamongall: I was going to say ...what happened ... but I know i will get 100 answers ..."Nothing" |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|paulg: but partner could conceivably only have 5 hearts if he didn't want to introduce a weak 4-card minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: scoreboard about to hit high gear|pg||
nt|marlowepi: by my calculations that equals Celsius 200. i wonder if that is the title in Europe|pg||
nt|petepunt: looks like cahnces now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jallerton: i think @s switch gives the 11th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Howard told Garvey "I've got king-jack"|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3 aces and a side suit with KQ! |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|mowen: what else is there to do|pg||
nt|viren169: good start for defense... taking out the entry early!|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h7|nt|viren169: just bidding his shape out over 2N|pg||
nt|mowen: for what reason - to tell the oppo what to lead?|pg||
nt|viren169: N does best to pitch a heart...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|finch: sometimes it's hard to envisage any layout where you are making|pg||
nt|finch: if South is 2227 with Hx in diamonds, he makes now by heart ruff, ace and a diamond|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ianrei: jeffreys right - the CQ holding the lead works|pg||
nt|mowen: 2nd disaster for n/s|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry 218|pg||
nt|lestergold: true if q of club led makes|pg||
nt|finch: although that's wildly unlikely given the diamond discard|pg||
nt|ciaran: England in 4HX on the board where Ireland made 5HX|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: so maybe nom defence to beat it|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i don;t think the 3S bid should be forcing in that sequence|pg||
nt|cindy: no not 3S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade back and two off after one winning finesse|pg||
nt|mariner1: and 4 trumps|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
nt|eamongall: that would make a grown man cry ...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|viren169: not sure this line will succeed!|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are a lot of hands where W would want to try for game in case E has something of a fit, but if not he should be able to get out. after all it is not like he would ever want E ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't think it's a slam force, unless their opening bids are sound|pg||
mc|12|nt|mariner1: well I would take my chances|pg||
nt|othered1: But I think after not taking a bid, east would cooperate with any slam try and that west never gave him a chance|pg||

nt|vugraphzkp: EE says 'captain's orders@@ !!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulg: as it is, no-one seems to have bid their majors ... perhaps this is tipping point of the minor-suit comeback|pg||

pc|c2|nt|ciaran: Good restraint from Selway|pg||
nt|viren169: maybe 1-off?|pg||

nt|jallerton: has chances in all the suits|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: how would you like the suit?|pg||
nt|jallerton: The problem was the 1NT bid.  S not expecting a stiff heart in partner's hand|pg||
nt|ciaran: looks like 4H is a likely make, but would be very pushy to bid it|pg||
nt|petepunt: yes yea cup were doing well i think|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Thats true, but not giving a chance.....|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ciaran: I think I'd have overcalled 2@S with such a good suit and shape|pg||
nt|jcomyn: over 1S u mean |pg||
nt|ciaran: Yes|pg||
nt|james_h: I dont doubt you for 1 sec Ciaran|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but that might be systemic|pg||
nt|ciaran: Well since a 1S response only shows 4, a 2S overcall should be natural|pg||
nt|jcomyn: it would with me but you never know|pg||
nt|james_h: For the Kibs ... Like most good players Ciaran sees the silver lining never the cloud|pg||
nt|mowen: I think denning needs to lead the @C9 to beat this|pg||

pc|d9|pg||
nt|jallerton: 4@s 2@h 2@d|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jferg: true so club 10 would suggest hearts|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ianrei: W should have ducked the D|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree that west must try to make a slam try and not just inquire about generic strength or side x.  But to force to slam is wildly gambling unless your openings are very sound|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jallerton: still off.  E has to come to a trick in each suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: apart from @d of course|pg||
nt|ianrei: he has 4D, 2S and 2 Aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: but no comms|pg||
nt|ianrei: if he puts in the H10, E has to get off lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think there were considerably more hands where slam makes than not,,,,, I'm a|pg||
nt|mariner1: bidder|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|petepunt: had some chances if @S right|pg||
nt|viren169: lots of money going on Norman going down!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|viren169: Defense still needs to be careful...|pg||
nt|finch: this is going a couple off I think with the spade finesse wrong and both heart honours wrong|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: if readable as middle yes|pg||
nt|finch: yes, the @SK onside was a necessary start to make it|pg||
nt|petepunt: might well be 3 off after @S ducked|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ianrei: needs to play SQ|pg||
nt|viren169: I with Norman to make it!|pg||

nt|sharkirl: operator?  did he not play the Jack?|pg||
nt|viren169: I expect hearts to be found in the other room!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cindy: and take your st bernard with you everywhere|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok plan B, try to let this make|pg||
nt|lestergold: nine tricks now without even having to take the spade finesse|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
nt|mowen: looks good|pg||
pc|c2|pc|hT|pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||
nt|petepunt: dbl should show a good hand with 3+ @S but needs great care|pg||
pc|h8|nt|paulg: at the other table North will play this in 1NT|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer is making an effort here... not sure about the defense!|pg||
nt|sharkirl: I can't believe this defence by Mesbur?  perhaps he assumed Holland had 5 @Ss|pg||
nt|viren169: Easy for us... we can see all 4 hands... |pg||
nt|finch: yes, he can effectively cross ruff and come to quite a few tricks|pg||
nt|mowen: and go down I guess|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jallerton: in fact the hearts are blocked so probably OK|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: wait, i am confused, whose bidding are we talking about? i thought all this was prompted by cindy's comment about the 2H call, but now it seems we are duiscussing S|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|viren169: Yes all seems a bit strange... Maybe he felt sorry for Holland!|pg||
nt|sharkirl: playing 5@D undoubled in Open Room|pg||
nt|viren169: Now only 3 off!|pg||
nt|mowen: south is sort of squeezed|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|eamongall: Garvey will be heading for home shortly losing just @DA |pg||
pc|d2|nt|viren169: 6N found on the board 22!|pg||
