nt|sybarra: he may be able to tell us about these teams |pg||
nt|yo_yo: according to wikopedia "The UK has the second largest overseas Pakistani population after Saudi Arabia"|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|santyclz: Slm Ehsan.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i suppose the most famous pakistani bridge player is Zia|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: but he commutes between London and USA i think|pg||
mb|p|pc|s5|nt|lestergold: open room 6S and 4s is not even lay down can make on the lie|pg||
nt|sybarra: well at least we stopped in time |pg||
nt|lestergold: took them 11 bids to overbid to 6s in the open|pg||
nt|yo_yo: North is looking lovingly at his void|pg||
nt|santyclz: For Zia fans on bbo.  None of the "Zia"s on bbo is Zia.  He has several logons but they don't contain his name.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: please tell us which they are|pg||
nt|sybarra: NO|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I'm a fan|pg||
nt|santyclz: If he wanted them known he would use his real name.|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are all a fan of Zia |pg||
nt|yo_yo: He's played in Manchester a few times|pg||

nt|lestergold: now south should sign off|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has|pg||
nt|lestergold: will north have the duiscipline?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if Khan bids on  Bilal will leave the room|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|lestergold: well stopped|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is our first vugraph broadcast from Pakistan ever, the land of Zia so to speak. We welcome the Pakistan Bridge Federation and wish them the best of luck|pg||
nt|lestergold: now they have work cut out to make 5 for a hefty swing|pg||
nt|yo_yo: here here|pg||

nt|santyclz: Good morning, Roland.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well Gib seems to know how to make 5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i can see 9 tricks |pg||
nt|lestergold: big problem, here of course is how to deal with those hearts- two can go on dims one can b established one ruffed in theory|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 5 @S tricks, 3 ruffs , A@D |pg||
nt|lestergold: keep going Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: err|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i suppose he can make 4@D tricks actually|pg||
nt|ehsana: better sense in this room...6S was palyed in the closed room|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep it a helpful lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: problem is sorting out the order of tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: west needs to duck the queen of dims to create problems|pg||
nt|ehsana: ...and the tempo|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt he can/will|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ok i can see 10 now|pg||

nt|sybarra: invite sequence |pg||
nt|yo_yo: is this puppet stayman?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|othered1: 3N, played at the other table, has a risk of going down when 6@S makes.  But the 2@C response, assuming it's natural, may minimize the likelihood of @C lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Peggy Bayer: ENG 175 (maximum!) - SCOT 143 - WAL 102 - NI 49 - IRE 44|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: I hate the 3N bid, wonder if 2N would have been nonforcing or would have shown many extras, part of a hateful fast arrival approach to this auction?|pg||

mb|p|nt|bgn: Usually not so valuable to push when you have defence to other major|pg||
nt|hedyg: not sure why she did that since N was a passed hand|pg||
nt|chick: apparently not|pg||
nt|santyclz: Some type of stayman starting with a p.  Puppet of psychic.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugrapha4: system card says "other: 5 card enquiry"|pg||
nt|chick: E can see 6 tricks... where to find the other 3?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bgn: North is a demon reopener, so from West's viewpoint quite possible for N to double if West passes 2@S, and South to compete (not on this hand though)|pg||

nt|hedyg: not at all obvious for a passed hand to ask pd to bid on the 3 level|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bgn: Quite true. She would only do it if short in @S|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't imagine 2NT would have been forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes in case pd's pass was a trap pass|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|dburn: so that South could not really do other than bid 3NT - North did not have to pass it, of course, but one can see why he might|pg||
nt|othered1: Then maybe 2N forcing over 1@S?  Seems a better description than starting off with a semi-psych.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|nt|santyclz: Just has to pitch a @c from dmy on the 1st round of @ss and hold the ace for the 3rd round.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c3|nt|dburn: 2NT might show a spade raise directly over 1@s|pg||
pc|s6|nt|chick: that might be J2N|pg||

nt|chick: that's a good move ... the contract is hopeless, so go for ONLY -1|pg||

nt|sybarra: suggested by a Neth. player,   4 clubs  world Convention :)   5+ clubs and a longer major suit |pg||
nt|yo_yo: We've all done it, we pass thinking we can come in later and all of a sudden we cant show both suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: I dont like to hint it but maybe south put the spoke in hoping to9 wrong foot Ismail but normally one does these things at favourable at that vulnerabilit it can lead to enormous ...|pg||

nt|othered1: OK, then NS *can* choose to tie themselves in knots with  their NT bidding.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here is a good example hand. What you do not double a weak NT with. Too weak, no attractive lead|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: po tej sesji bedzie przerwa obiadowa|pg||
nt|hedyg: i will not ask why..|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Mind you, the defence was not world class, but still|pg||
nt|othered1: Was west's opening a weak NT at the other table or an upgrade to strong?  That's quite a hand with a good 5-card major to open as a weak NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was a weak NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh dear they made 4@S on the hand I said normal human beings wouldnt|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|hedyg: maybe she should have bid 1@s and not XX, has no bid now|pg||

nt|santyclz: Happy to see e didn't commit a weak nt on this hand.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: It has become an obsessions for some. When opps open a weak NT, *you* feel you are being robbed because you have a 13 count|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: south is tanking|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: has pulled d3 to the side of her hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont mind a 1NT opener on this actually|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bgn: the @H certainly makes partner happier than anything else :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|dburn: on the other hand, of course, if both North and South have balanced 13 counts and no one doubles, they will indeed have been robbed|pg||
nt|sybarra: knows she is pickling pard with trump lead|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bgn: but still only 1 off I think|pg||
nt|yo_yo: tells partner  what you have and is preemptive at the same time vs vul opps|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: Soputh can hardly have a 13 count for her initial pass|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: but south may have a bit of leeway to double lighter than in the direct position|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have not stolen anything from you, so keep a low profile|pg||
pc|d8|nt|santyclz: N figures (rightly) they have no tricks left out of trump so hopes to develope a 2nd trump trick by giving ruff sluffs.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|dburn: but I tend to agree that the North hand qualifies for a slow pass rather than a penalty double|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hedyg: and @s|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: Of course, double by a  passed hand is likely to have a conventional meaning|pg||

pc|c4|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d6|nt|bgn: because I'm not strong enough to bid 2@S if partner bids 2@H over my 2@D bid. For me that shows extra|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: rofl|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hedyg: in that case maybe she should have opened 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: This has the potential to be another medium swing to Ireland, as N. Ireland's chances to win the event are slipping away.|pg||

nt|sybarra: right, he knows that |pg||
nt|ehsana: your point valid..but a nine count is enormous|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: I think he will make 7,  will cash a/k of trumps and start playing winners |pg||

nt|santyclz: Only way to go down, Shirley.|pg||
nt|ehsana: good end plus one brd even|pg||
nt|sybarra: why does he go down?   trumps 4 -0?|pg||
nt|lestergold: sarf will play  heart and cover what is played to guard against 4/0 break|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so he will do a safety play in trumps here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: low to 10?|pg||

nt|lestergold: yes|pg||
nt|msap: guys please wait a few minutes before play resumes after a few minutes|pg||

nt|sybarra: do you XX or bid 1 @s?|pg||
nt|bgn: I'm guessing you'd rather defend 2@D than play 2@H, so perhaps there was a misunderstanding|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|bgn: I'd probably bid 1@S - defending at the one level is too hard for me|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: E could have started with @d|pg||
nt|santyclz: Larry Lande:  almost any 5-4 hand that N might hold would provide at least a play for a vul game (only need 38%) even with 0 hcp.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sybarra: but pard is playing  1 @C XX,  so you can relax|pg||

nt|dburn: good decision by West not to raise the pre-empt with 3@S|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|othered1: Not unblocking is silly at best, even if east retains an entry here|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dburn: they did indeed block the spades, but they can survive that with East having @dA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, declarer could have knocked out @DA and make it|pg||

pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: South had to knock out East's entry, not West's|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||

pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: Declarer does not play a 3rd round of diamonds!|pg||

nt|chick: I'd be happy if the women's events were eliminated altogether ... there is nothing about bridge that is gender-dependent|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in that case we wouldnt see many women playing |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I must say on acbl, I would skip the "stacks" |pg||
nt|chick: to me, it's an insult to think that women require their own event so they don't have to compete against men|pg||
nt|yo_yo: at club level men and women are about equal in ability|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: would be a shame if you never got to play overseas cause all the top players were guys|pg||
nt|yo_yo: at top level  the women fall away|pg||

nt|sybarra: starting the scramble with the XX |pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|othered1: transfer response of some type?|pg||

mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: Undo please|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South passed over 4NT|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@S?  even in a limited opening system, stiff honor and acelessness make that ultra aggressive|pg||
nt|athene: north knows his partner has an ace on the bidding, so can lead the @HA and beat 5@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphpl2: http://pzbs.pl/wyniki/2009/krajowe/gpp/02pila/gp.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: the hands werent very exciting |pg||
nt|sybarra: and to the ABF,  and Nick Farher for bringing this terrific tourney to BBO |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Oh well, they really are tired|pg||
nt|dburn: might make an overtrick or so, in truth|pg||
nt|sybarra: actually as pointed out by spec,  how do you NOT make it |pg||
nt|sybarra: *Fahrer |pg||
pc|d2|nt|bgn: Interesting auction in other room - looks like they checked back to find 5-3 @H fit, then played 3NT anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: and how did they not make that?|pg||
nt|bgn: can make 3NT also - but have choice of lines. Can play for @D 4-4 or take @S finesse|pg||
nt|olson: they did not finesse the spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D lead?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: 5@C taken as three keycards|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|sybarra: no bidding in the other room |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry Nick,  will get your name sorted out some day |pg||
pc|h9|nt|dburn: maybe they were convinced that diamonds were 4-4, so they played on clubs and not spades|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why didnt they double 6@c I am asked. Because South did not bid 6@C, West did|pg||
nt|athene: well north, with an ace in his hand, knows a wheel fell off|pg||
nt|athene: since east is making grand slam tries|pg||
nt|athene: so i think he can deduce it was a misunderstanding over the ambiguous 5@C RKCB bid|pg||
nt|athene: and double|pg||
nt|santyclz: Anyone for ducking the 1st @d?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to our spec,  the greatest audience in the world for keeping us straight with your comments  (and we like you humor also)|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu all next set|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But isn't it normal to bid 5@S after the 0 or 3 response? Partner passes with 0 and raises with 3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|othered1: Maybe this is just another RKC problem (of which there are many, even at higher levels than this)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: throw them in and hope they give me a club trick?|pg||
nt|santyclz: And thanks to Shirley.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
pc|h5|nt|olson: declarer won the first diamond in the other room,  if ducked  EW might reveal hoiw the suit is splitting |pg||
pc|h8|nt|bgn: so a swing to Havas will make the match close again at the end of the set|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|henryb: I think there was confusion. West thought he was playing 1430 and showed 1. East decided 1 was impossible and that partner was playing 0314 and that it had to be 3|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think they play 1430 and 5@C showed 1 or 4|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|hT|nt|othered1: it coiuldn't have been 4 from east's perspective|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|chick: or maybe he was just swinging|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah i see bourke has caught up!|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|sybarra: and making 6! |pg||

nt|sybarra: where are the points he is thinking |pg||
mb|3H|nt|ehsana: 5c stands no chance - |pg||

nt|lestergold: the issue is will south be able to unambiguously direct the dim lead mind u 5c will almost ceertainly be defeated as north will lead spades and switch if he doesnt find dim|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: not sure that sequence exists|pg||

nt|lestergold: in any case if they are playing standard suit pref should get it right easily enuf|pg||
nt|ehsana: ew praying for club switch|pg||

nt|santyclz: If n cashes the @sk, s will play the Q and ease any fears by n.|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: England playing against Scotland|pg||

nt|chick: it's an easy one to miss at the table though :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|the saint: So having bought the hand through West's inaction over the opening, Ireland are now getting overboard|pg||
nt|othered1: On the NS cards alone, 4@H can make, but if you're going to open south's hand, maybe 3@S is a bit much on north's.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h3|nt|hedyg: yes just ruff 1 @H|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|dburn: this can go down two, but the defence is not that easy, and down one is perhaps a more likely outcome|pg||
nt|the saint: Well, this is going off on a club ruff. But there is also a diamond trick to be had|pg||
nt|sybarra: is missing because q of @C on side |pg||
nt|sybarra: not a slam I want to be in |pg||

nt|sybarra: so I just bid 4 @H |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|chick: 2 schools of thought ... some say splinter is for finding distributional slams, others say that 2/1 is better for slam hands, and splinters are for limit-min game hands|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: hey about that @H suit!|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h6|nt|dburn: it might have been better had he misread the lead and shifted to a diaond|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|othered1: Might a higher @S from west have tipped east to the @D shift?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|dburn: since now, the defenders cannot collect their diamond trick|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Eng 127 - NI 117 - Scot 108 - Ire 87 - Wal 97|pg||
