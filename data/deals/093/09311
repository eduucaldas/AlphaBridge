nt|Vugraphu2: They are discussing systems now.|pg||
nt|petergill: Rubin usually plays a Strong Club system as at http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=218&pid=131|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|d!|an|13-16|nt|dburn: I seem to recall that this pair used to play a complex system called the Ultimate Club|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: so presumably they won't be playing a strong club system now, or they would have had to rename the old one the Penultimate Club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Double looks like the Woolsey convention. 4 of a major and a loinger minor|pg||
mb|2D|an|!s and !d|nt|Walddk2: 2@C pass or correct|pg||
nt|dburn: still, it seems that East-West play a weak no trump and North-South play non-penalty doubles of it, which is a bit odd|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl = 13-16 by putting my cursor on the bid|pg||
nt|petergill: John Diamond was happy to play 1NTX, hence his pass of 1NTX. |pg||
nt|dburn: useful method, if combined with "loud double = 17+"|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT is 13-16|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Surely John Diamond will bid 2@S now? No ...|pg||
nt|dburn: but still, Diamond seems to have been talked out of competing in spades|pg||
mb|2H|nt|petergill: Having passed 1NTX, perhaps his pass of 2@D is forcing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: that could be, I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: and he was checking to see if partner had a penalty double of 2@D?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: it would not appear so - this is all rather strange|pg||
mb|p|pc|d8|nt|petergill: NS make 9 ot 10 tricks in @D and EW might make 9 tricks in spades |pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I see - South had actually shown diamonds and spades|pg||
nt|dburn: which is what deterred West|pg||
nt|petergill: I see|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|petergill: EW actually make only 8 tricks in spades, so passing out 3@d is fine|pg||
nt|dburn: still, the same sort of thing happened at the other table, where South competed over 1@h with a Michaels-like cue bid that also showed spades|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Jeff Olson from USA|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl of 1NT might have shown a two suiter in a minor and a major. |pg||
pc|c9|nt|olson: 4s and longer diamonds |pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer can (might?) make 10 tricks now that a second @d has not been played by the defence. |pg||
nt|olson: y|pg||
nt|petergill: or Matt Granovetter might play safe for his contract. |pg||
nt|dburn: I don't think so - he doesn't quite have the trump spots for all of that|pg||
nt|petergill: Matt G is quite a deliberate player who likes to take his time. |pg||
nt|olson: 1s 1h 7d  on a crossruff|pg||
nt|dinos1: can safely ruff @c low|pg||
nt|dburn: so he can, sorry|pg||
nt|dinos1: after E showed 5@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Looks like he is arranging the order of card play.|pg||
nt|petergill: In fact this table is likely to be the last one to finish, with three of the players not inclined to play too fast. |pg||
pc|s4|pc|cQ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|petergill: This is a safety play for his contract. |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|petergill: In 3rd seat at fav vul, experts like to be active|pg||
mb|d|nt|dinos1: 1N now?|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure whether 1@s at the other table was tactical or systemic|pg||
nt|olson: 1n seems thin on 13 hcp|pg||
nt|dinos1: 1N by E|pg||
mb|1S|an|transfer to nt|nt|olson: ok  that seems more reasonable  |pg||
nt|dburn: but East must have been a bit surprised when 2@s went down after he produced that dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: I would bid 2@H on the South cards|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dinos1: so E "bid" 1N :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@S transfer to 1NT was East's choice|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not so easy to find the spade fit if no-one bids them|pg||
nt|petergill: EW presumably play that XX = @H and 1@H = @S after the X. |pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: Well, Platnick did in a way, but it did not show spades|pg||
nt|dburn: nor the club fit, but North-South's actions are entirely understandable|pg||
pc|c2|nt|olson: this  should lead to d1 |pg||
nt|petergill: With such flat hands, EW missing their 4-4 spade fit is not a big deal. |pg||
nt|olson: with the H ruff|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4333 and soft values|pg||
nt|dburn: the trouble is that South is declarer again, so this hand will not be played quickly either|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: Good lead. On a non-club lead (or no club ruff), declarer might make 2@H. |pg||
nt|dinos1: but nowmakes|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|olson: he still might since the club ruff may be harder to find now|pg||
nt|dinos1: @c4 looked too low ;-)|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d8|pg||
nt|dinos1: back to @c ruff if def will find it|pg||
pc|d6|nt|olson: exit dia  looks best now|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|petergill: South chose 2@H not 2@C because the t/o dbl tends to show majors, but an highly organised pair who use their two bites at the cherry (dbl of 1@s transfer, dbl of 1NT after passing ...|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S) could show 4/4 in @H/@C and reach clubs. |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|olson: to kill the entry to the club ruff|pg||
nt|dinos1: or @d ruff now|pg||
nt|petergill: Another chance to set up a club ruff. |pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|petergill: but no entry to give the ruff|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - he needed to play a spade and then a heart, not exit with that diamond|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||

nt|dinos1: @d|pg||
mc|9|nt|olson: 140 ?|pg||
nt|petergill: Once East had @CA and @DQ, it was clear to South that West had @HA|pg||

nt|petergill: He claimed 110 I think, certainly not 140. Scores on BBO are unofficial.  |pg||
nt|petergill: West is too strong for a 13-16 1NT, so he will open 1@S.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: 16 and such a strong 5-carder is certainly worth 17|pg||
mb|1C|an|Strong|nt|petergill: 1@C strong. |pg||
nt|dburn: or possibly a strong club|pg||
mb|3D|an|transfer to nt !h or !s +!c|nt|petergill: 3@D looks like a transfer preempt|pg||
nt|olson: I hope so :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: @h pre or 2-suiter?|pg||
nt|dburn: but this may have the effect of pushing East-West to an uncomfortable level|pg||
mb|d|an|Game forcing values.|nt|dburn: since if East doubles to show some values, West may bid 3@s, and East may not even pass that|pg||
nt|petergill: suitable vulnerability, good suit texture, preempt to the max versus strong club, hence Rubin bids at the 3 level, not the 2 level. |pg||
nt|olson: can E pass 3s over 3h ?|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly he can - the question is, will he?|pg||
nt|olson: we would expect w to bid 3s at some  point|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D = @H or (spades and clubs)|pg||
nt|dburn: or maybe he can't, since double appears to be a game force|pg||
nt|dinos1: so as I told 3@d is 2-way|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C17+ I think, so East has game forced|pg||
nt|olson: ew may play 4s now|pg||
mb|4H|nt|petergill: 4@H = very bold. |pg||
nt|dburn: 4@h? crikey - did 3@d show an Acol two bid?|pg||
nt|petergill: both North and South have bid 'em up due to the fav vulnerability. |pg||
nt|dburn: but still, it may cause West to bid 4@s|pg||
nt|olson: maybe he hopes ron has the black 2 suiter |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dinos1: then he cd bid just 3@h|pg||
nt|petergill: Usually it's best to have a parnership style that only one of you bids 'em up at fav vul - perhaps only the first person to bid in the auction. |pg||
nt|dinos1: pass is forcing|pg||
nt|dburn: on the other hand, if East-West judge very well indeed, they could go plus against 4@h doubled|pg||
mb|d|nt|petergill: Dbl, all Pass, or Dbl --> 4@S - we will see.  |pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|dburn: quite a lot of IMPs on this decision|pg||
nt|petergill: Diamond's spades look good for 4@S, but his heart holding looks good for defence|pg||
mb|4N|nt|dinos1: why not to bid them over 4@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: the trouble is that East will not play West for a one-suiter on this kind of auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Where are they heading?|pg||
mb|5C|nt|Walddk2: 4NT meant as minors I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|olson: nosebleed territory|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: This is why experts preempts a lot vs Strong Club - EW haven't bid their spade suit early, so they cannot judge. |pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|nt|petergill: Yes, he knew partner couldn't have a massive spade suit for the Pass of 4@H. |pg||
nt|petergill: Neither N nor S had anything resembling a Dbl of 5@c. |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: Right|pg||
nt|olson: unless  they could see partners hand|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: The battle is for -300, -200 or -400. |pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT = minors, hence 5@C. |pg||
nt|dinos1: @hJ now|pg||
nt|dburn: best to play hearts now, but South may not do that|pg||
pc|s8|nt|petergill: If West had have squirmed before calling 5@C, NS might have smelled that a penatly double was in order, hence West's smooth 5@C call. |pg||
nt|dburn: he didn't|pg||

nt|petergill: 1@D 10-15, Strong Club style, I think|pg||

mb|2S|an|5+S and 4!d.|mb|p|nt|petergill: South cannot give preference to 3@C becasue he doesn't know that North has clubs --> another awkward hand for strong club systems. |pg||
nt|petergill: hence Roland's idea that North should bid 3@c over 2@H|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|dburn: well, South can be pretty sure that North has clubs - he doesn't have hearts, and he doesn't have diamonds|pg||

nt|petergill: so South thinks North is 10-15 with 5+ spades and 4 diamonds|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petergill: which is item 4 in their possibilities for a 1@d opening|pg||
nt|dinos1: and after no neg X with both M's to bid 2@s is strange|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - it seems that North decided to treat his hand as 4=1=4=4 rather than four spades and a longer side suit|pg||
nt|olson: 3c gets the suit into play since N probably does not want to play spades after the 2h bid  -  3c  would be NF and a better spot|pg||
nt|petergill: see how the 2@D interference put the multi-meaing 1@d opening off track - just as the 3@d overcall of the storng club put EW off course on the previous hand.|pg||
