mb|p|mb|3D|nt|garnetts: 4@S made in the OR and I cannot quite see how yet--unless they took the double spade finesse|pg||
nt|santyclz: As Kaplan used to say:  I have nothing against opening a (weak) nt with a 5-card suit, I just haven't come across the right hand yet.|pg||

pc|h2|nt|santyclz: Perfect trumps for a high x-ruff, difficult with 4333 however.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|granguru: would you bid  2@C?|pg||

nt|garnetts: why 2@D on a balanced hand?|pg||

pc|s5|nt|garnetts: It will get a result that is deserved--kiss of death at pairs|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|granguru: well - when playing ghestem michaels copenhagen or any other....normally you have an opportunity to show the great hand by bidding again|pg||

pc|s2|nt|garnetts: Lets hope they are just settling in|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: reckon 3@H was quite well judged - gave South the chance to bid 3N wiht good pointy-suit stops|pg||

nt|viren169: David, what do you think of the Bergen convention?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As NS have 10 tricks in @c it´s ok with -1 (I guess -1)|pg||

nt|garnetts: I think my oppo should be made to use it|pg||
nt|viren169: playing for high stakes no doubt!|pg||
nt|garnetts: it works especially badly if playing 2/1 because it does not allow you develop middle range hands with a decent six card suit|pg||

nt|mrt2000: N couldn't handle to @S successfully|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: A demonstration of why leads matter --a spade and dec has no play |pg||
nt|santyclz: X or whatever shows the majors?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|viren169: good lead problem!|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 1@S?  |pg||

nt|santyclz: Probably lebensohl.|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: except that it is played by West|pg||
nt|viren169: 1@S denies spades I guess|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|granguru: As it will here|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|viren169: and 1N probably show spades... to right side the NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: That is an example of what I mean by an alert being necessary|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As I play I can show a 1-card major (defined) and another 4-card suit, so we can find our 5-4 in @s|pg||
mb|3H|nt|granguru: A @D lead beats 4@H |pg||
nt|viren169: North has done well to introduce hearts!|pg||
nt|granguru: this contract will probably fail|pg||
nt|eamongall: EBU vouchers are great ... you can buy bridge books from Brian Senior |pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: a @D lead could  help declarer a lot|pg||
nt|mrt2000: it will make on a red suit lead|pg||
mb|5C|nt|garnetts: well done North |pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: but the defense opened @Hs ...establishing 3 defensive tricks |pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: club straight back!|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: made!|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||

mb|p|nt|olson: yes,  if 4@h somehow makes,  then 1@C is down 3 or 4 ,  bidding at these colors saves NS and only rewards EW when they make  a game|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|othered1: On this board (the last of the set?), I don't understand south's aggression in the open room.|pg||
nt|olson: if the Vul is flipped, then it takes little to make 620     QXX  QJXX  XXX  XX   as you beat 1C! 150|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|olson: when E wins the club K  W should suit pref  for the lowest suit  |pg||

nt|othered1: if east gets @S wrong, she may win 2@C tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|olson: not an easy position for East  |pg||
pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: well if they do play smith peters that 9@D looked very encouraging for @S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|olson: y  I agree  west had limited chices  to signal  |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|othered1: It isn't.  And with that @CJ as a possible entry . . .|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yo_yo: i think she will cash ace|pg||
