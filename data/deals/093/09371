nt|mdgraham: Good evening all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good morning|pg||
nt|hausigel: hello everyone|pg||
nt|hausigel: hello vladimir|pg||
nt|xenya: hi Roland|pg||
nt|hausigel: hello everyone!|pg||
nt|werge: hello|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: hey|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|werge: So - we start with a good slam, bad distribution...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Hans, re Roland.|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|mmmakela: hi all! |pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|hausigel: hi hans, hi joe|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|bjacobs: howdy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Linköping for the second half of this match|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4 @D now?or dbl|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Linköping in Sweden|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last match of 24 boards now (2 segments of 12)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: hey|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|Walddk4: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/league/division.php?action=view&id=1865  for standing after round 8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jack Oest|pg||
nt|joest: hi all|pg||
nt|hausigel: on a normal day, either slam (6@H / 6@S) would depend on the @D layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|hausigel: this look like a fun board to start with. looks like NS can make 7@C|pg||
nt|xenya: we start off with an excellen grand slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Henry Bethe and David Edwin|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Carlos|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Textbook bidding to start|pg||
nt|werge: No - with "normal breaks", you only need one @d-trick |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: Hi David, Roland|pg||
nt|ady: hi Roland    Henry|pg||
nt|henryb: and Liz|pg||
nt|othered1: This hasn't been a very competitive match so far and KNEP really needs to get things into gear if they're to have a chance|pg||
pc|dK|nt|odysseus69: good morning all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good morninng Victor!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Sheila Adamson, Bill Jacobs and Christer Kristoffersen|pg||
nt|sheila a: Good morning|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H is a pretty good spot here but NS never got the suit into the auction|pg||
nt|othered1: Here north will likely come up with an overtrick or two|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello again!|pg||
nt|hausigel: right...|pg||
nt|hausigel: (and no overruffs)|pg||
nt|santyclz: As Strider said:  Today is not that day.|pg||
nt|werge: But 6 @H is possible, but very difficult. 6 @S is dead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|stoffers: 1nt or 2@c as responce to the double? |pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am OK with 1NT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: shows 6-10 in my book|pg||
nt|sheila a: If 1NT promises values it's more descriptive than 2@c|pg||
nt|stoffers: yes, agree|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My 1NT is constructive, so I'd have chosen 2@C|pg||
nt|joest: I'm busy looking around on the website looking for system information|pg||
nt|hausigel: needs clubs 2-1, diamonds no worse than 4-2|pg||
nt|werge: Worse bidding I have only seen once, that was by my partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: EW had a bidding mixup|pg||
nt|werge: or 2...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: Hi Liz, David and Henry!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good morning Ralf- pleased to have a Swedish commentator with knowledge of the invisible players|pg||
nt|joest: http://www.svenskbridge.se/user.php?id.1304|pg||
nt|werge: But this mistake will probably pay well|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|othered1: HI, Ralf!|pg||
pc|h5|nt|stoffers: but then again, would have been SO nice to bid 2@s after the 1NT responce to show short @s and a good hand :)|pg||
nt|viren169: Hi all|pg||
nt|hausigel: declarer will win five trump tricks, AK twice, three ruffs and the long @D|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk4: hmmm something is wrong here. Berg-Ragnarsson playing in both rooms|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Roland, Vladimir, Marshall and Joe|pg||
nt|xenya: now if S can diagnose a spade void... |pg||
nt|hausigel: hi Roland|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: NS plays swedish club system (1@c 11-13 bal or 17+) EW plays strong @C|pg||
nt|hausigel: hi Joe|pg||
nt|xenya: Hello Joe|pg||
nt|hausigel: hi Marshall|pg||
nt|xenya: Roland|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Roland, Roland, Marshall and Vladimir.|pg||
nt|xenya: what is 5N, i wonder|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps has to do something with the void|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nice hand to start off with.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is a tournament with handicap, hence the 43 IMPs in advance for the OS.se team|pg||
nt|hausigel: I guess South is trying to count is tricks and assessing his chances in case North is 0=4=5=4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in the grand slam, if a spade is led S will probably play to ruff three spades small and one with the king. but W will probably lead a club or heart|pg||
nt|santyclz: On this side of the pond 5nt usually shows 2kc and a void.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: Ragnarsson is also TD and there are some problems in other room, that's why we have had a break|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: now he's back|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Calle Ragnarsson is one of Sweden's best tournament directors|pg||
nt|xenya: ah he was in the other room, not in the tank|pg||
pc|h2|nt|daman: Good Morning Everyone|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operator, you sure N-S are Berg-Ragnarsson?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: hi Ralf|pg||
nt|sheila a: I think we should take a firm line against this cloning|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Markku and George|pg||
nt|santyclz: Irish bidding.  (Luck of the...)  Avoided the doomed slams.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk4: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/league/division.php?action=view&id=1865  for standing after round 7|pg||
nt|daman: Hi agasin Markku|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so 4 @D would've been better, only 300 this|pg||
nt|joest: declarer has ten top tricks once there is no diamond lead and I presume he's about to take them and move on to the next board|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello again!|pg||
nt|xenya: well done|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ralfwil: not the best lead, I had not thought about it with so small cards under KQ|pg||
nt|xenya: simple and clean|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yeah, bad enough that I'm cloned 14 times|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In fact it s N who has to bid 2@h instead of 3@c|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sheila a: Do the EU know what's going on?|pg||
nt|othered1: I think so, if 1@C was natural.  |pg||
nt|joest: hi Ralk|pg||
nt|joest: ralf|pg||
pc|c3|nt|odysseus69: I agree about the choice of lead but it did no real harm|pg||
nt|stoffers: N needed to play that club to beat it!|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Everyone|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when E follows, S will eventually see that he needs 4-2 diamonds or else (very unlikely) the same hand to have a singleton in both minors. it would be nice to ruff four spades in ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dummy but the entries aren;t there if Ds are 5-1|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk4: Hi George, Gad and Joe|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi George|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|viren169: Hi George|pg||
nt|viren169: Hi Joe|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Gad, George, Roland.|pg||
nt|daman: must be careful now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bjacobs: He doesn't have to cash @CA, as far as I can see|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2 clubs, 3 diamonds, 3 hearts?|pg||
nt|stoffers: can just play for 3 diamonds when @h are 3-3 yes|pg||
mc|7|nt|sheila a: W can still make if he takes the @d finesse, runs @h and puts N in with a @d?|pg||
nt|stoffers: ehhh|pg||
pg||

mb|1D!|nt|mariner1: hi Jan and John :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Bob, Hans and Allan|pg||
nt|bobholl: good 3 nt ew|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Amazingly close after 112 boards|pg||
nt|allanr44: Hi Roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Should we start with a fast 5 @D|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: welcome to first of 2 rounds of semi-finals|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi roland :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: hi all :)|pg||
nt|werge: 3 @S = partner bid 3 NT, if you have a @s-stopper|pg||
nt|werge: But the defence has 5 redtricks|pg||
nt|werge: - or 3 NT|pg||
nt|allanr44: good idea|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: hi Cindy :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi cindy, shirley, and specs|pg||
nt|cindy: hi marshall :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Marshall |pg||
nt|werge: red tricks|pg||
nt|werge: - and 4 @S is a winner - a lucky one|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Is there a web site for this event (Gold Coast of Australia)?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Horwitz is here by virtue of winning the Swiss Qualifying|pg||
nt|werge: North is more disciplined here than South...|pg||
nt|bobholl: why not double with S ?|pg||
nt|werge: Double - or PASS|pg||
nt|werge: So - 3 @S now|pg||
nt|allanr44: spade lead would be good for east in a diamond contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: 1+6432|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 82|pg||
nt|werge: Ace of @H - and small @C, South has just overcalled, you might misguess|pg||
nt|bobholl: even without @S lead 5@D will make|pg||
pc|dK|nt|janm: I don't know, I'm afraid.|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.qldbridge.com/gcc/           tournament site|pg||
nt|janm: I think this is matchpoints, and we'll be watching 3 boards at a time, right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that look like a 4H call to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ohno had to win a 24 board match to get back into the run for the gold|pg||
nt|npcjpn: sorry, private.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 4NT is a good save.|pg||
nt|allanr44: it will, but the pressure would be off|pg||
nt|bobholl: small @C lead is unfindable|pg||
nt|werge: West followed my bidding-line, not at gerat player then|pg||
nt|werge: great|pg||
nt|bobholl: KISS keep it simplle stupid is no bad advice|pg||
nt|werge: For sure not - buy not always followed|pg||
nt|allanr44: such a lot of spade values ...|pg||
nt|werge: In my club the bidding here would be: 2 @S pas 3 @S all pass|pg||
nt|bobholl: E is afraid of his @D :)|pg||
nt|allanr44: and rightly so|pg||
nt|werge: Many pairs plat, that in this situation (West) you bid the enemy suit, which you can stop|pg||
nt|werge: play|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cindy: agree|pg||
nt|sybarra: prefer 4 ht, but all will be well here also |pg||
nt|werge: Yes - undobled, 5 @C is the right contract, if doubleb'|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Yamada showed his hand and claimed nine :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mariner1: this is an absolutely gorgeous site..... Roland should have sent us!|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Right.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.  Welcome from the beautiful Poconos where it's -10c and snowing hard.|pg||
nt|swanson: N-S could afford to bid spades up to the 3-level, but they haven't found a way to enter the auction.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Welcome to the GC, 26c and we're all indoors playing bridge . :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.qldbridge.com/gcc/results.php  - results|pg||
nt|bobholl: another @S bid to say i like @D|pg||
nt|werge: I would not blame East, when - in 30 seconds - he claims for one down|pg||
nt|werge: - in 5 @D, not in 6|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|janm: 2@d had a very wide range here and East, with nice shape and a little extra in terms of values invited something higher - I think they'd better stop here though|pg||
nt|cindy: this will work out ok but i would bid 4H|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mariner1: hi Ally!|pg||
nt|forni: and we're back at Ohno vs Horwitz, which became an exciting match after two swings in favour of Ohno.|pg||
nt|forni: welcome back, all 23 of you!|pg||
nt|forni: :P|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|bobholl: they play a fairly sound overcall :)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, actually my comment was just about the S hand, not about the probable result|pg||
nt|forni: starts off exciting|pg||
nt|forni: ouch|pg||
nt|bobholl: now surely a @S lead sure i said :)|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|cindy: we knew that :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: have the guts to duck?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i don;t eat that part|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: she is considering :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: now small @C :)|pg||
nt|werge: If South had doubled 1 @D, this was a lay-down|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|forni: too bad|pg||
nt|forni: 4@D will make, but so will 4@H|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: wow, tough crowd|pg||
nt|sybarra: could not cost could it?|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult decesion now finesse @D or nbot|pg||
pc|dA|nt|allanr44: ah well ...|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bobholl: normally this works fine but not now|pg||
nt|bobholl: chickken ! :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: understandable no @H raise|pg||
nt|Walddk4: For your information fellow commentators, E-W are women ("she/her")|pg||
nt|allanr44: he would have loved to play NT, but his heart stop was tenuous  :)|pg||
nt|allanr44: oops, she, sorry|pg||
nt|werge: Well played by South - he avoided the OVERtrick|pg||

nt|sheila a: And N must have @dK for the opening bid, so all is well. Don't think that's the actual result|pg||
nt|daman: grand slam time|pg||
nt|joest: I believe the Zang team currently is  2 in the round robin while Curt-Lennart is languishing in the ninth spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: 2NT should have shown a running suit|pg||
nt|santyclz: That's impressive!  Even Roland wants 12.89%.|pg||
nt|hausigel: lets see how they handle this one. i doubt they will end up in 3NT again|pg||
nt|hausigel: but who knows...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not the best defence so likely only 1|pg||
nt|viren169: Nice hand for N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Is it usual to put on the highest from a sequence, when partner plays the suit. I normally play the lowest. Here @dJ from J10xx|pg||
nt|daman: in either of 3 suits :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: NS has nothing outside spades|pg||
nt|daman: can even make 7@H|pg||
nt|daman: for all of the matchpoints :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: interesting to see W's approach|pg||
nt|hausigel: excellent start for NS. easy to miss the grand with only 28 HCP|pg||
nt|werge: East will play 4 @h - down one...|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|henryb: 170 and 140 is also an imp: 5 or 4|pg||
nt|ady: think they might get overboard here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Quite hard to hold it to 7 tricks, I think|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 7@H is on|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am told they eat turbot|pg||
nt|hausigel: now back to normal (something like 2@S)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|santyclz: 23 hcp grand.  Not too often you see them.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sheila a: That's a big han|pg||
nt|daman: this looks systemic|pg||
nt|joest: some peculiar actions ina standard structure|pg||
nt|werge: This time they (re)bid theirs suitts|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@H seems a bit windy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as in wet?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: British weather|pg||
nt|joest: 1@c I understand; south's pass I don't|pg||
nt|joest: west seems strong for 1NT|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to reach though!|pg||
nt|daman: I wonder if they can get to the grand salami?|pg||
nt|viren169: all revolves around no wasted values in   clubs...|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@C now may solve that problem....|pg||
nt|daman: what would we bid over 1@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: thinking of catching up?|pg||
nt|santyclz: And the fact that all suits break doesn't hurt.|pg||
nt|daman: splinter with a void?|pg||
nt|hausigel: 4@H looks like the best spot (in theory)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: need to see a cc to explain e-w system - 1C rather than 1D suggests that weak nt hands are opened 1C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion W should bid 1@d|pg||
nt|joest: mine too|pg||
nt|santyclz: Seldom see so many wrong cards.|pg||
nt|hausigel: yes... 6 honors offside, and a ruff - impressive|pg||
nt|werge: But this ruff will favor the declarer!|pg||
nt|hausigel: it wouldnt occur to me after this bidding to attack clubs anyway|pg||
nt|santyclz: Would 4nt by w be natural?|pg||
nt|hausigel: i dont think so|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: still, he caught up|pg||
nt|henryb: seems to me it shows proper appreciation of the lack of value of quacks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and what will the mention by double be then?|pg||
nt|othered1: Only an overtrick is in play here|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: but even so, this is rather trappy bidding|pg||
nt|ady: only need club finesse and hearts behaving|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Too flat for my liking :)|pg||
nt|othered1: without @S lead, declarer should have 10 tricks|pg||
nt|hausigel: the free 4@C bid basically rules out NT contracts|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: i doubt East will pass this|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Too many jacks?|pg||
nt|viren169: shame... with co|pg||
nt|viren169: controls in all 4 suits... 3@H is an underbid for me...|pg||
nt|daman: if they played exclusion BW   that would have worked    as it was  3@H was a huge underbid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how many of us would double 1D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: or a @s lead|pg||
nt|daman: South is getting indigestion right about now|pg||
nt|santyclz: Of course a light 1@h opening by s would have been helpful.|pg||
nt|viren169: very light!|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Is 3@H invitational for any of you? It isn't for me. You have lots of other bids available for an invite|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, competitive|pg||
nt|ady: have to get diamonds soon|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no! |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Purely competing - looks as if North revalued his collection|pg||
nt|henryb: yes all those quacks suddenly became 6 high card points!|pg||
nt|henryb: (quacks are queens and jacks)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Manaca should know declarer has the singleton @SK|pg||
nt|ady: was  this the 2@C lead?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did partner not lead a spade? Because he doesn't have both top honours|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, and no tens.  A very average hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I se double as a try to find a major and also some kind of strength|pg||
nt|werge: Will North pass this?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|henryb: yes. a sensible person who does not play MUD|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H is 20+, any shape|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hope so|pg||
nt|hausigel: I would...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk4: We think Hed-Andersson are N-S  because they play that system|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Berg-Ragnarsson don't|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6@C is not the world's worst contract|pg||
nt|joest: but with what people open these days, I'm not sure how South can avoid a 1NT overcall to keep from being stolen blind.  He did howver pick the right hand to pass :)|pg||
nt|daman: I would have passed the South hand|pg||
nt|viren169: me too...|pg||
nt|werge: To pass 6 ! C with the North hand indicates, that you will never loose. TAHT´s a DOUBLLE|pg||
pc|h7|nt|daman: seems to me 2@D followed by 3@D was a bit like a Walsh bid   showing both minors with longer @Ds|pg||
nt|daman: and a huge hand   3@S would have been a cuebid|pg||
nt|daman: as well  as 4@H|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes - @C2, 3rd & 5th|pg||
nt|ady: next a@D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: It cannot be difficult to see where the 4 tricks in defence will come from|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Could you get new names up operator please?|pg||
nt|stoffers: simular to viking-precision Roland?|pg||
nt|sheila a: The average Scottish club player would be in 3NT in 4 bids on these cards. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Click on North and insert Hed, then on South and insert Andersson|pg||
pc|h3|nt|viren169: it would have worked well here!|pg||
nt|hausigel: maybe, since 1@D can be artificial, double also has some unusual meaning for them|pg||
nt|werge: Let the opponents write +1090 once every 100 years - but 3 down for 150 is like jogginh instead of sprinting|pg||
pc|h9|nt|odysseus69: 1NT looks like a super maximum but perhaps 1C is 11-12 and East downgraded|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@C - 2@D  - 3NT?  Only three bids perhaps|pg||
nt|santyclz: Does the boxing term featherweight apply in bridge?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|daman: 6@D is a bit strange      5NT would have shown that hand|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2 aces+void? 5 nt|pg||
nt|daman: shows a void with 2 key cards|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Kind of Stoffers, but they play a limited 8-11 1M opening|pg||
nt|sheila a: In the old days people would just open 3NT - 1 bid!|pg||
nt|mmmakela: maybe they switched the replyes |pg||
nt|ralfwil: That is also one of the weaknesses with strong @c|pg||
nt|daman: sure does|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bjacobs: Actually, quite recently, I was playing a 3NT opening as showing 25-26|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Better than gambling minor at least|pg||
nt|daman: and bantamweight|pg||
nt|xenya: i might -- though not with great confidence...|pg||
nt|santyclz: I would if 1@d showed @ds.  If not, no.|pg||
nt|hausigel: i dont like the heart lead|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: thx Liz|pg||
nt|santyclz: It wouldn't have occurred to me.|pg||
nt|werge: It´s a 100% @S-lead from South|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bjacobs: indeed|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|stoffers: indeed|pg||
nt|joest: Stenstom squeezed in three suits there|pg||
nt|viren169: underweight!|pg||
nt|santyclz: I would open the s hand playing precision but not otherwise.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzkz: 1@D was 11-13 bal or 4+@D|pg||
nt|xenya: then i pass|pg||
nt|hausigel: agree|pg||
nt|werge: Maybe that´s the reason, North did´nt double - he knows how South leads|pg||
nt|hausigel: actually, I would hope to beat 6@C even with an unfortunate lead|pg||
nt|werge: Sure - |pg||
pc|dT|nt|stoffers: 3@s is a nice tool for that :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Right about strong club.  Not having a natural 1@C bid available sometimes has a  price attached.  Last hand might have been one of those|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ralfwil: claim!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|santyclz: Or Western Rabbit in which 10hcp is a mandatory opener.|pg||
nt|viren169: I would open South's hand if someone held a gun to my head!|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d4|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like great stop|pg||
nt|othered1: can't declarer claim for us?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bjacobs: East can kill the club suit|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bjacobs: Not that it does much good in the overall scheme of things|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sheila a: But the @s position makes it all hopeless|pg||
nt|Walddk4: As Fred Gitelman so wisely said once upon a time. "By all means, open 3NT, but only if you do NOT want to play there". He was referring to gamebling minor|pg||
nt|stoffers: well said|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I've got a system summary for N-S now. One sec|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Many years ago, I was playing in a major event against Paul Marston and Malcolm Sims (New Zealanders then)|pg||
nt|stoffers: the 3NT opening is bad, such is the 2NT opening showing 5-5 minors and weak, dont you just love to decleare a contract vs that opening? You know the whole hand in trick 3!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: NS play Pass= 0-7 or 17+, 1C 12-16 any, 1NT 12-14. Other bid in first or second position 8-11 (1D bal, 4441 or 4*major+longer minor. 1H/S 5+Major, 2C/D 5+ minor no major and 2 H 55 ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: in majors). Response to Pass (i.e. opening in third or fourth same as second, but 1C 0-7 or 16+, 1 NT 15-17 and 8-11 opening are 8-15).|pg||
nt|santyclz: The good news is that on a pointed suit lead 5@c doesn't make either.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bjacobs: I looked at their very complicated system card (relay system) and noticed that there was nothing marked against a 2NT opening|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|werge: 5 @C doubled at the other table will bring N/S there 5 easy IMP´s|pg||

nt|swanson: Not a good effort by N-S.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peter Gill taking no chances with the @S finesse -- 5@C making 5 is nice score|pg||
nt|werge: In my world, North has two 5-cards suits...|pg||
nt|bobholl: well he didn't :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: this is Open Pairs so we will not have scores shown......|pg||
nt|swanson: E-W will likely be off one in 2@S here.  Dangerour for SOuth to enter vulnerable with weak minor suits.|pg||
nt|mariner1: weak NT by E|pg||
nt|forni: really?|pg||
nt|forni: if North had 5-5, in my world he would've started off with 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Yamada-Ohno have been playing together for 30+ years. In Beijing their team won the Senior Event|pg||

nt|allanr44: Easy 12 - 13 is a worry|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|forni: so 6-5 is probable|pg||
mb|d|nt|janm: West will probably transfer to spades... wrong again!|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 aces opposite a strong @C :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cindy: hi all    little bit of a late start|pg||
nt|allanr44: and the singleton D!  May go overboard|pg||

nt|vlad9:  hi all|pg||

nt|vugraphzku: hi vlad|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mariner1: @SA on side, @c 3 3 , @D 3 3 with Q@D in pocket|pg||
nt|swanson: I would have preferred to pass with the South hand with the plan of making a takeout double of hearts if E-W try to play at the two level.|pg||
nt|mariner1: the @H lead works for defense for taps|pg||
nt|janm: 2NT seems a pretty big position to take certainly|pg||
nt|mariner1:  http://www.qldbridge.com/gcc/           tournament site  -|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or else 2NT, followed by 3S (depending on agreements)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play a Weak NT and an uncommon 2@D opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we should be able to follow most of the other auctions|pg||
nt|vlad9:  everyone plays precision here|pg||
nt|vlad9:  precision for bulgarians is something like polish clubs for the poles|pg||
pc|h8|nt|cindy: N has the hand I like ot be able to bid a nonforcing 2H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after the jump to 4S, Pass by E would surely be forcing, so W should really pass here|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Bakkeren asking about the 2NT bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like lebbish|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Bakkeren in the tank|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so that is what it is|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: in the tank.....|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Bakkeren ...thinking|pg||
nt|sybarra: challenging hand |pg||
pc|h7|nt|cindy: just in case S has some 6/4 red suited hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be in the tank also |pg||
nt|marlowepi: if W was asking about the 2NT bid, i would guess he was just stalling for time. it is pretty obvious what kind of hand N has|pg||
nt|bobholl: sensible|pg||
nt|allanr44: if they bid the grand, and get the heart lead, the trump 9 is out of action right away|pg||
nt|werge: Impossible to do better for N/S|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|npcjpn: they play 2@c as a puppet to 2@d, usually a start of a sign-off, hence 2@d is Stayman.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Jim Patrick|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|2hplus4: hi there|pg||
nt|vlad9:  hi|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: who is a 5 @S bidder? |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: shd reach and make 4 @S here|pg||
nt|bobholl: good balance but no great gain|pg||
pc|h2|nt|janm: How greedy should N be?|pg||
nt|santyclz: An inspired or foolish bid, depending on the result.|pg||
nt|mariner1: agreed, the VUL position vs NV might indicate prudence here|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|swanson: The cards are lying quite well for N-S and declarer is forced to take advantage of it.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pass by E would have been forcing|pg||
nt|forni: well I have to agree with you on that one :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: well, i like playing that NF, but i would still pass 2D|pg||
nt|cindy: sometimes partner has the perfect hand where we can make 4H|pg||

nt|cindy: hi|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello Cindy, Marshall and Dwayne|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with only 3HCP in my 2 suits and no spade spots, i would not be eager to advance the bidding. i doubt we are missing a game|pg||

pc|hA|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Sunil Varghese and Ruud von Seida|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|npcjpn: east is hoping partner has four hearts, but.....|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: lead has made it a bit easier|pg||
pc|d2|nt|swanson: Well, maybe not.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So you hardly see natural systems in Bulgaria, Vladimir?|pg||
nt|vlad9:  it is enourmosly difficult to score back 50 imps in 16 boards but not impossible|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|hT|nt|keylime: W-E if memory serves are playing Dutch Doubleton|pg||
nt|cindy: its rare but there are times when partner has nothing but the A in diamonds and its perfect|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we know that @C are 3-2 and @DK is onside, but Ohno will try not to rely upon the finesse|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: wonder what 3 sp would have been instead of 2?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|keylime: while N-S are using a weak NT, but unconfirmed about whether it's a strong club system or not|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but i would bid 5S on a different hand, with different bidding|pg||
pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: what isn;t rare is for partner to have 2263, with 2D our last makeable spot|pg||
nt|cindy: thats true|pg||
nt|keylime: especially with the lack of 1NT rebid as well|pg||
nt|cindy: but would you give up a chance for plus 620 when you might go down 100 ?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: after using up dummy's entries though -- he may have no other choices thought|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe @D discard, @H then endplay West?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes. the Nickell team can do it regularly it seems but few others|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: oops   Ohno is female -- SHE may look for other options|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now he can combine chances of @Hk being right or clubs 3-3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|keylime: I would. Partner never has what I need for game. :-)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|boedhy: yes will make it now|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: both work :)|pg||
nt|allanr44: in 6 draw trumps.  In 7, must risk a small D ruff|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|boedhy: I recently had a long discusion abouy leading from Kings against trump contracts |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: so much for alternatives :(|pg||
pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: depends on what i thought the odds were on us having a game. i rate them slightly under googolpex to one/ if pd has 64 reds, most of my hand is wasted|pg||
nt|cindy: you poor thing :)|pg||
nt|vlad9:  few bulgarians play natural|pg||
nt|vlad9:  especially at this level almost noone|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Which systems are popular?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|keylime: I would only consider a try, if South's hand was really prime, i.e. a lot of A's and K's|pg||
nt|bobholl: with @C ace right he can make|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|mariner1: not hooking the @D really costs here|pg||

nt|cuttysark: That would be artistic!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "What's your 2NT opening" I asked|pg||
nt|stoffers: i much prefer the zia way to open 2NT for minors, Qx-Qx majors is a must :)|pg||
nt|othered1: That figures to win an imp or two for KNEP|pg||
nt|viren169: I think Karlsson will mentally put slam swing against in his mind!|pg||
nt|santyclz: A theorhetical question.  Should s play the hand to maximize tricks or to cater to a distribution in which 6@hs won't make?|pg||
nt|viren169: interesting question... I would go for the former!|pg||
nt|xenya: lovely ending|pg||
nt|werge: Who wants to play 1 NT here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but perhaps 1 imp loss 9 or 10 tricks in @d|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: 5@D  ok here     |pg||
nt|henryb: well below. 20% is less than 38%|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sims replied: "We don't use it.  The system is perfect without it"|pg||
nt|joest: i expect LOTS of bidding here|pg||
nt|daman: maximize|pg||
mb|p|nt|stoffers: hehe, nice|pg||
nt|santyclz: In either case I doubt he went down 3. Oper please check that score.|pg||
nt|viren169: play the contract you are in rather than the one you would like to be in (or the one at the other table!)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Roland's favorite.  A 20/20 hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Let me think about that one, Henry|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@D - 1N?|pg||
nt|joest: 2@s was alerted?|pg||
nt|viren169: light opener here...|pg||
nt|viren169: will work well for 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 20 less than 38|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 @H par here?|pg||
nt|joest: I think South should bid 3@h which, as a passed hand, should be fit-showing (hearts and clubs)|pg||
nt|daman: S is in a quandry    shd pass and bid after?|pg||
nt|hausigel: maybe some of the discards werent right?|pg||
nt|hausigel: it appears strange that West and North threw clubs|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|henryb: I would overcall 1@s because of the overwhelming suit quality|pg||
nt|viren169: S will show both majs one way or another|pg||
nt|daman: nope     |pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: agree|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Thank you Henry - did you compute the singletong @HQ?|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@H could have stolen EW's spot.|pg||
nt|daman: but East will not sit|pg||
nt|santyclz: N thinks he has a working singleton.|pg||
nt|xenya: another cold slam |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a superfit!|pg||

pc|h9|nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to Ralf Willquist|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hi all|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hej Ralf|pg||
nt|othered1: EW can make 2 or 3@H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sheila a: But was their system perfect? :)|pg||
nt|viren169: like 5@H now for the lead... rather than 5@S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|stoffers: will he get the @d right?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, they relayed lower with all the strong hands.  And they probably held Chris's views on using it to show a weak hand - too informative for the opponents|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bill, did you keep the system notes for later? If not, scroll back please, I am all over the place with 6 tables up|pg||
nt|joest: looks like this make right on time|pg||
nt|daman: what to do   what to do|pg||
nt|Walddk3: It's my favourite to play in a fit|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Seems odd that they can't come to rest in diamonds|pg||
nt|werge: Then go for it -find it, Roland|pg||
nt|hausigel: what about opening 1@H?|pg||
nt|hausigel: and rebid 2@D|pg||
nt|hausigel: there you are|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 1@D  1@S  ;  2@C     for me, playing a natural system, 2@C is the best rebid with West's cards|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Most flexible|pg||
nt|werge: Good Matchpoint-bidding...|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|henryb: yes. picking up hearts is 52% and the club finesse is 50%.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: at least 10 tricks with crossruff|pg||
nt|odysseus69: these guys are certainly conservative|pg||
nt|xenya: might not be too easy to bid though |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|bjacobs: ok, boss|pg||
nt|othered1: 6 off the top now.  Do you try for @S trick right away, at some risk|pg||
nt|viren169: nice pass for par result!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|daman: I would have unsheathed the blade if I were east    does he really think he is bidding to make?|pg||
nt|viren169: Bd 14 result doesnt seem right?!?!|pg||
nt|daman: new operator|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: cash 3 rounds of @h and crossruff|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not easy to reach game but after this start East might have risked 3 spades|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a finess in @s is needed to make the contract. N will play @d when in on @h A or K|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But he got help|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|henryb: and the contract is not cold with 3-1 hearts and the club onside|pg||
pc|h8|nt|viren169: let's bring back the old one then!|pg||
nt|daman: shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mmmakela: was making anyway w spade fin: 4 discards|pg||
nt|daman: Hoi Ralf|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|hT|nt|othered1: Perhaps the other J was played?|pg||
nt|viren169: only kidding!|pg||
nt|hausigel: the 2@D rebid does not look satisfying - but alternatives are flawed as well|pg||
nt|xenya: well W took charge of things|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good job to reach this cold slam|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bjacobs: I was so caught up in my story - so N/S are playing Forcing Pass methods?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes|pg||
nt|viren169: we like the new operator!|pg||
nt|daman: he should claim down 1|pg||
nt|viren169: and we like all his friends and family...|pg||
nt|santyclz: And particularly his dog.|pg||
nt|werge: But 4 x @H will be a good start for declarer|pg||
pc|c5|nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with a so sharp hand (2 aces and a singleton) I agree|pg||
nt|odysseus69: prefer your suggestion Ralf|pg||
nt|sheila a: How much difference does that make? If you have weak 2 bids you'd open them anyway, I presume|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think best defence is to assume that he has 0-7 and bid accordingly. Your system is on|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You just cannot come in with a rubbish overcall at the 1 level ... which is what big clubbers don't like|pg||
nt|hausigel: nice to hear the 4@D response|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bjacobs: And they are playing a rather nasty form of it ... where Pass could be weak or strong|pg||
nt|Walddk4: pass 0-7 or 17+|pg||
nt|sheila a: Can we confirm that the previous two contracts did in fact make?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So over the pass you don't know whether to bid normally or interrupt their system|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thats the idea|pg||
nt|bjacobs: However, maybe the system is not as destructive as some ... for example 1@H and 1@S "ferts" (weak hands)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cuttysark: When I was a gal West's overcal would improve the odds on the club finesse. Not now, though, I agree|pg||
nt|odysseus69: about play|pg||
nt|santyclz: Even gets the ruff in the long trump hand.|pg||
nt|werge: North must keep declarer out of dummy|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i wonder what a 2H rebid would have meant|pg||

nt|bobholl: i meant in 6 if @D are 52 still ruff small @D :)|pg||
nt|vlad9:  precision in various modifications 90%|pg||
nt|vlad9:  polish club 5%|pg||
nt|vlad9:  and some other highly artificial systems|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Another 5-6|pg||
nt|forni: yeap|pg||
nt|forni: and it'll become interesting what one would bid with S after 1@C|pg||
nt|forni: I'm very fond of bidding known 2-suiters|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: a spec suggested that W might have deliberately underbid, walking the dog. but S had shown his hand and N was marked with only a few points. so it easily could have gone all pass|pg||
nt|allanr44: the trump 8 would become significant if the Ds were 5 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: i had a partner who has never led away from a king :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Here, North is the best to be declarer in 3 NT|pg||
nt|forni: so if I could bid 2@C or 3@C or 2NT or 3@D as @S+@D, I would surely do so.|pg||
nt|forni: But|pg||
nt|forni: I don't realise... my 1@C is forcing, and it's actually kinda normal that E would open a strong 2@C :P|pg||
nt|vlad9:  2/1 the rest|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: p p p|pg||
nt|forni: now E has an interesting problem|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult bid for shen now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|keylime: N-S may get a little nudge here into game|pg||
nt|cindy: yes|pg||
nt|cindy: N wouldnt pass 3C anyway|pg||
pc|c5|nt|nickf: Fiona Brown, who came 4th in World Mixed Pairs a few years ago when just 22|pg||
nt|forni: yes blackwould would surely do, I always think too difficult|pg||
nt|forni: :S|pg||
nt|boedhy: better to underlead aces in his opinion. and well I agree with him |pg||
nt|bobholl: solved neatly|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: i would be very nervous of cidding just 3C with the S hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my methods, pass is strong inaction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now THAT is surprising -- I thought Yamada would double again|pg||
nt|bobholl: rule of 16 not applied (points+@S )|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|swanson: THree boards per round I believe, then we get new players (at least different players).|pg||
nt|cindy: i bet he was starting to sweat a little|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|mariner1: Fiona was also an excellent Vugraph Operator during the Yeh Cup!|pg||
nt|boedhy: And was he right ? Sunil|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|swanson: This delayed raise by East generally is used to show a solid values for 2@H.|pg||
nt|keylime: 3@c seens a little conservative to me as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: letting the opponents play 2-level in 8 card fit tends to lose more than it gains|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if u have to underlead i wud prefer to underlead from a king|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but i am not arguing with the LAW Rudd :)|pg||
nt|boedhy: aggresive bidding from Shen. But even with this good lead will make 4@s on the @c I think|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes just set up clubs|pg||
nt|bobholl: there you are a pass would have been better :)|pg||
nt|vlad9:  1nt seems very easy here|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect he was trying to walk the dog|pg||
nt|allanr44: EW would need to pick well to make 3H|pg||
nt|bobholl: peek would be easier|pg||
nt|allanr44: That's where we have the advantage  :)|pg||
nt|2hplus4: This looks comfortable|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cindy: would you just forget the club suit and bid 4H ?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Lots of tricks if he gets @D correct|pg||
pc|dA|nt|swanson: With less, East is required to simply raise 1@H to 2@H and forget about spades.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|keylime: I would bid clubs, to cater to short hearts - with seven of them, and the side club suit, I want to clue pard in to my hand; I certainly will have probably one more bid|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sunsamvar: Has to use the sparse entries to dummy wisely|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: and as we see 3@D is excellent contract|pg||
nt|bobholl: this lead migth give overtrick :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: is this a trick with aJ7 :)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would probably bid 4C ovber 2D|pg||
nt|allanr44: :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|vlad9:  180 is coming|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: I wish I could tell them this :) |pg||
pc|h7|nt|keylime: 4@c may have been a splinter tho hence the 3@c call|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|boedhy: @c J will tell him he is on the right track...|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be to risky to try :)|pg||
nt|vlad9:  :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|boedhy: so now @h finesse|pg||
nt|allanr44: making 2|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s2|nt|sunsamvar: the bad break will do declarer in.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: well, i would be bidding clubs for a different reason. i always want to play in hearts unless there is a 3-4 card disparity in N's suit lengths|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|pc|d8|nt|bobholl: we play that a double in the sandwich is 45 and 1nt 54 even if you play 1nt strong you could use it here :)|pg||
nt|2hplus4: There's not a lot you can say about 1NT contracts|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: no 180 anymore :) |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, dwayne, no doubt u r right about 4C being a spolinter|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's a reasonable compromise|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s7|nt|sunsamvar: probably better to use the only entry to take the @D fin|pg||
nt|boedhy: Do you know these players Sunil?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|swanson: South would have been better off to continue North's good idea of leading trumps.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|s3|nt|janm: EW certainly got the better of this round, but it's not clear how much|pg||
nt|swanson: I think they won by a bunch.  TOugher this round, they have to play against themselves.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Are we watching leaders or random draw?|pg||
nt|nickf: to be expected. MAtheson is the current Australian Open Pairs Champ - he's about 20 and Jan Cormack has been a leading international for about 30 years|pg||
nt|nickf: 1 table from the 7 table final|pg||
nt|mariner1: my guess is leaders,,,,, Nick probably knows|pg||
nt|swanson: I would think random. Too tough to set up to watch only the leaders.|pg||
nt|nickf: random|pg||
nt|nickf: here are the leaders after 2/3 rounds|pg||

nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
nt|werge: This might be tuff|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|sheila a: I guess the defence didn't switch to @d?|pg||
nt|othered1: EW have partial in @S here, since @C suit is "frozen" for defense and @D can be set up for pitch|pg||
nt|othered1: that allows 3@S|pg||
nt|joest: this looks to be a quiet 1NT by north|pg||
nt|viren169: on the last|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oper, highlight bd 14 and type in 3hs+3|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 4@d bid doesn't exactly hurt either.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and a push it was|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt best on W|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi kursat|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|mdgraham: good flat board, then|pg||
nt|daman: 4@H +2|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Kursat.|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@h by n?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score hand if staying low|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Kursat|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|Walddk2: Double would not be my choice|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In a natural system  1@c - 1@h 1@s - 2@s  - 3@h - 4@s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: so what is 1@D, Bill? (I forget)|pg||
nt|othered1: Lirarna did pick up a vul game swing on board 13 on what looks like a big @C auction there, without interference by east|pg||
nt|daman: looks like a 4@S game here for NS|pg||
nt|hausigel: I know a lot of people who play 4@D as artificial (ace-asking, etc...)|pg||
nt|werge: This was the last winning contract - 4 @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: What is East going to do over a 1@H response?|pg||
nt|hausigel: nice to see a straightforward forcing 4@D raise - worked out very well here|pg||
mb|p|nt|hausigel: if North had bid 3@H (solid minor),maybe South would have found 5@D|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: put down dummy?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I see, 1NT, but that shows a much stronger hand in my book|pg||
nt|cuttysark: just shows opening strength over a club - I guess the alternative is Pass, but who does that?|pg||
nt|henryb: bid 1NT to show 18-20 balanced of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: @d singleton to xxxx|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and this is not so risky David?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 8-11 (1D bal, 4441 or 4*major+longer minor. |pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t like 3@s on W. For me 2@s is better and accept an invitation|pg||
nt|joest: n-s are presumably playing a weak NT so that this rebid showed extras|pg||
nt|santyclz: Sorry 4hs+3|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@S looks a bit aggresive...|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mdgraham: West is taking it as that....|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If playing the method he should bid 1@S to show 4|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this is the same way that North bid a 4-3-3-3 13 count on board 1 - so still not clear about system|pg||
nt|bjacobs: )|pg||
nt|bjacobs: (Forgot to close the bracket :))|pg||
nt|viren169: worked well|pg||
nt|santyclz: I like 3@h for 2 reasons.  1 as you stated and the other is that if pd bids 4@s over 4@h you don't have any problem.|pg||
nt|hausigel: good point|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes, he is taking him seriously, and should|pg||
nt|vbman: yes 4 dia was terrific|pg||
nt|hausigel: hi kursat|pg||
nt|hausigel: good bidding. impossible to go down on the layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: I would have bid 2@H and not 3@S|pg||
nt|hausigel: 10 or 11 trics, quite likely|pg||
nt|hausigel: *tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 12|pg||
nt|xenya: i think i would make this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: some discussion about the bidding |pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart to ace and low heart, twelve tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: warning Mr. Jacobs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: "You can't be serious"|pg||
nt|joest: this is going to be touch and go|pg||
nt|joest: strongest would seem to duck the first club, win the second and play a spade, perhaps forcing them to do something good foryou|pg||
nt|viren169: I think a simple 2@D was in order there... and raise spades next time|pg||
nt|daman: 3@S should show a different hand|pg||
nt|viren169: I dont mind 2@H either!|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|othered1: Actually, east needs to work out the @D position in order to get the pitch.  Pulling two trumps and then exiting in @H awaiting help from opponents is a possibililty, but not clear|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bjacobs: Never sure with Roland ....|pg||
pc|c6|nt|henryb: I really hate off shape take out doubles|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@h = 4-cards @s|pg||
nt|daman: yes   puppet|pg||
nt|viren169: I think 3@S should show 4xxx shape with a card or two|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Strong @c|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: I would ask a kibitzer to table the cards rush to the bathroom|pg||
nt|daman: yes   more preemptive|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: South must remember to cover if @HJ is led from dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *and rush|pg||
nt|ady: between them they are bidding about 10 points more than they have    west's 3@H somewhat an exageration   already found a voluntary bid on first round|pg||
nt|daman: destined to make at least 9 tricks|pg||
nt|viren169: more pre-empt value|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, East has a plan for beating 1NT here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: or he should have|pg||
nt|ralfwil: On this hand you can see the advantage of weak nt. You can rebid 1nt  with confidence|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|cuttysark: Unlikely game is making with both opponents bidding|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb: no David. Partner showed 18-20, so W forced and offered a choice of contract|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|othered1: there is a case for north's covering the @D 10, even though it might look foolish in some positions|pg||
nt|joest: note the power of north's five of clubs!|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|odysseus69: but not on board 1?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: only when they run|pg||
pc|h8|nt|santyclz: Make a lot of money at the track, Marshall?|pg||
nt|hausigel: after all, the 4@H is not that surprising - once in a while, East has good @H support, when you endplay yourself by doubling|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: weak (less than 1nt) ot 17+|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or..|pg||
pc|cA|nt|joest: east-west can't break diamonds|pg||
nt|joest: profitably :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|odysseus69: i am told that 1S is either 17-20 or what it was on board1 - balanced 11-13|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A @h finess is needed. After winning with @dQ a @s shift|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but is not so difficult after a @h discard from N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and no @c return|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W must have a complete count on N|pg||
pc|c9|nt|joest: he probably wants to hop to prevent an entry for another heart play|pg||
nt|joest: oon board two Curt-Lennart wandered into 3@s on their 4-3 and went down one, losing six imps to the 180 inthis room|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h7|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ralfwil: @cJ?????|pg||
nt|vbman: so a dbl sq on?|pg||
nt|hausigel: 11 only... :(|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|cuttysark: South seems to believe in 3rd hand J from J10. Unusual approach|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ady: even with 18  game very doubtful with that poor heart suit   and I think many will bid 2NT with 19 or 20 whenpartner has made a bid that was not forced|pg||

nt|nickf: Barometer|pg||
nt|swanson: N-S are on for game here but it will not be asy to bid.|pg||
nt|janm: Especially if West starts with 2@s|pg||
nt|mariner1: well with only 7 pairs we could have a Howell or similar|pg||
nt|nickf: the scorers hope to provide almost real time scores|pg||
nt|janm: So much for 2@s|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: bid out of term and accepted|pg||
nt|keylime: I'd be thrilled to have pard give me honor-doub of my first suit with South's hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this vulnerability  2@S-1 and 3@D=  get same score  so  NS right again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no surprise -- Gill's 5@C contract on board 1 is a game swing|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Peter Gill|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi|pg||
nt|boedhy: Hi Peter|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: Hi Peter|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Shouldn't be 1NT this time|pg||
nt|vlad9:  it is a good opportunity for the loosing team to bid 3nt on a combined 23 hcp previous board - no other way to collect 5o imps in a hurry|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: still there is a chance :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: aha!|pg||
nt|werge: To me, West has the hand for a directly 4 @S-bid|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: 1 @D the "yucky" hand |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: N/S are playing weak NT |pg||
nt|allanr44: not many cards right for EW here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Gill plays transfer openings in some partnerships, but I didn't think this was one of them|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: finally a game contract that has decent chances to make|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I thought EW were playing Precision. Why not 2@C opener?|pg||
nt|vlad9:  because the cl  suit is too weak|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: as vlad said there are a lot of modifications :)|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mariner1: make that 14 pairs 7 tables|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 2@h is a limit for NS with careful defence.|pg||
nt|werge: But better let E/W play here|pg||
nt|bobholl: fairly difficult to reach to good 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: at first glance it may look like S  should rebid 4H, then bid 5C over 4S. but that does not have to be a suit--it could even be a void. so S wanted to bid clubs at his second turn. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: odd for a 7-5 hand to be awkward to bid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3nt ofcourse depends on locating the @Cq|pg||
nt|bobholl: not many :) none !|pg||
nt|allanr44: whew!|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugrapha3: sorry :)|pg||
nt|forni: I can agree with that|pg||
nt|forni: And even though East has a great hand if West would've bid 4@S directly, he doesn't nearly have enough aces to continue over 4@S|pg||
nt|werge: The danger is, that North - after 1 @S - can bid a leas-directing suit|pg||
nt|werge: lead-directing|pg||
nt|forni: N can bid a lead-directing suit for if W becomes declarer?|pg||
nt|werge: East MUST have showed the hand allready|pg||
nt|forni: The trouble for Peake now is: Why can't west have AKxxxx, Jxx, xx, Axx|pg||
nt|werge: OK, sleepy...|pg||
nt|bobholl: did i say difficult :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: if they play precision what is shen thinking about surely no slam possible :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: now it is :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: in the last set  they doubled 1D and meant it for takeout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this makes 5 of either minor - but only because of lucky @C position|pg||
nt|forni: that's why 4@S over 1@C is better.|pg||
nt|vlad9:  I open 1di also on these cards but it is a matter of partnership agreements|pg||
nt|2hplus4: But there are 6 of them It seems a distortion. Do they need solid clubs?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|cindy: this time apparently it means diamonds|pg||
nt|npcjpn: sure.|pg||
nt|werge: 7 easy tricks against 3 @C|pg||
nt|werge: - but East might be declarer in three other suits|pg||
nt|forni: plus NS could find their 5-red save.|pg||
nt|boedhy: tricky 3NT here will probably reach it but not sure he can make it on good defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: kokish i guess|pg||
nt|keylime: valid point Marshall - |pg||
nt|keylime: looks like it doesn't it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: judging by the N bidding, it still means takeout|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: now E is asking about the bidding|pg||
nt|vlad9:  2 honors  or some good spots  109  are needed for a solid 2cl opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Seems like a losing system to not be able to get that spade suit of Wes't in the auction immediately.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H over 1@S is interesting to me..... not passing to try penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: Kokish for those that don't know is 2@c-2@d-2@h, where hearts are either natural, or showing a specific range of balanced hand|pg||
nt|cindy: kokish makes these big balanced hands easier to bid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the @d overcall and support have steered them to 4@H|pg||
pc|d2|nt|janm: Interesting decision for South when East opened out of turn - I wonder if he'd have done better to have the bidding revert to West|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: I think it was a slip of attention for both|pg||
nt|keylime: hence the forced 2@s call.|pg||
nt|werge: Did´nt West bid his hand twice (at least..)|pg||
nt|werge: This will be 5 @S probably one down - @d- to the ace and misguessing the @C-suit|pg||
nt|bobholl: well it is a sub roland slam about 25%|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I'd rather miss the @C10 than bid a 3 card suit|pg||
nt|vlad9:  many open 2 cl only on long clubs no matter the quality of the suit but among experts is common not to open weak club suit with 2cl   even with a 6th suiter|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Look at the lead|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: hi zh |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cindy: yes  it was N last time that doubled for takeout and S thought it was diamonds|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry privie|pg||
nt|cindy: they didnt discuss apparently|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since i'm the only commentator -- if there are things you'd like me to cover rather than random raving -- just send me a chat message|pg||
nt|allanr44: Ace and another heart would have been better|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|cindy: didnt matter here since N chose to not Stayman|pg||
nt|keylime: named after the brilliant Canadian theorist, Eric Kokish.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is 2S 100% forced, then? i'm thinking it's better if N can bid 3H with spades, to get the play in the S hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: either before or after the misundersatnding|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Ohno beat the Hackett team (MELBOURNE - DE LIVERA - HIRST - HACKETT - BAKKEREN - BERTENS) this morning in a 24 board match  to make the semi finals |pg||
nt|boedhy: well this is the better side ...|pg||
nt|vlad9:  they play 2-4 / polish style / leads|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cindy: 8 card fit and lots of hcp but slam would be very difficult|pg||
nt|cindy: 2S is forced in kokish|pg||
nt|keylime: normally when i got to play Kokish it was almost 100% forced, unless I had a single suiter or certain 2 suiters.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe Yamada needed to raise to 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that would probably only make the auction less convincing|pg||
nt|npcjpn: south's first pass was a surprise.|pg||
nt|forni: that's not impossible :)|pg||
nt|werge: With thusd dummy, North can´t play others than a @C NOW|pg||
nt|forni: remember I called that 4@D with north's "5-5" in the red suits not the right contract? Other table decided to bid up to 5@D, winning 5 imps for Ohno.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: here a lead from the King wud have worked well Ruud|pg||
nt|petergill: If it's the same Shih, he partnered Mr Yeh in the recent Yeh Cup, is a current World Champion and is a regular in the Chinese Taipei Open Team. |pg||
nt|boedhy: with @s lead from North think it is down|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|davidstern: This event started with 246 teams. Six survived after 10 rounds of 10 boards. Top 2 to the semi-finals and the remaining four playing off for the other two spots|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|cindy: wouldnt it sort of defeat the purpose if 2S not forced ?|pg||
nt|keylime: open room is about to start on board 1, so we're going to have comparisons soon.|pg||
nt|werge: He smelled the misfit|pg||
nt|vlad9:  they give only count not attitude|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes but he led a @D not a @C|pg||
pc|c6|nt|swanson: The problem with trying for a penalty is that N-S surely have a minor suit fit and might be able to take a lot of tricks there - as they can here.|pg||
nt|bobholl: at least much easier|pg||
pc|c2|nt|allanr44: north knows that south can't have enough entries to play the heart and get in to cash them|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|davidstern: Lavazza Red Bocchi/Madala/Sementa/Duboi finished 7th|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty David |pg||
nt|davidstern: Simultaneously with this is a seniors final, a restricted final and novice final|pg||
nt|davidstern: Originally 388 teams in all divisions|pg||
nt|davidstern: Sorry the original was 10 rounds of 14 boards each|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|c3|nt|swanson: Netherland had a solid win over Sweden in the finals of the team event yesterday.|pg||
nt|werge: I think we have a problem here - for how long can North wait before smitching to the obvious @c?|pg||
nt|bobholl: good guessing hesitation may be :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|santyclz: Might have done better to lead another trump.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|davidstern: Temperature is 32C or 91F outside and very pleasant|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am surprised he ruffed with low club|pg||
nt|boedhy: true Sunil but here it is NT...:)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|keylime: certain hands like, both minors, can be hard over a strong 2@c hand|pg||
nt|keylime: hard to bid I meant|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no, i don;t think so. it ought to be possible to arrange alternative structure so that N & S can rveeal their hands while still allowing S to be declarer|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: i don't think it would matter|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes ofcourse|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|vlad9:  yes - one of the main disadvantages of precision is that pd doesnt know where to lead when you open 1 di |pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: he isn;lt going to cross to dummy with the 9, he is going to ruff cards in dummy|pg||
nt|npcjpn: yes, still, may have a game, though pass worked weil.|pg||
nt|bobholl: 7 tricks in :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|werge: OK - try for the @H Queen-drop - or guess the @C-suit. Good luck|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|davidstern: The four playing off here are Japanese Senior, Giura Melbourne, McGann|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c9|nt|werge: But how strong might East be passing over 1 H?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|forni: But australia takes back a swing on board 12 by bidding 3NT, which will be made|pg||
nt|boedhy: but found the good switch will he finish it well done form OU|pg||
nt|2hplus4: One reason for trying to bid your suits|pg||
pc|d5|nt|petergill: @S2 suit pref to show @DA|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well done|pg||
nt|bobholl: coming antoher one on the placing now|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry another|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s7|nt|vugrapha3: Gill not happy with his spade switch... shaking his head|pg||
nt|bobholl: but has to guess @H|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: W hasn;t worked out that they had a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he was expecting H ace in S|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|cindy: another advantage of kokish is being able to open 2C on two suited hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: responder would normally bid 2S, but with 4+ spades would do something else|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bobholl: !Next (joey silver always remarks)|pg||

nt|odysseus69: unusual - 4 boards and no contract beyond 2 level and no competitive auctions|pg||
nt|odysseus69: might get a little action here|pg||
nt|stoffers: lol, tough to predict things here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like a 4@h on E|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If the Q was played he would have covered and then - why not the 10?|pg||
nt|hausigel: ok, back with 12 - and the @D7|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: Ragnarsson: tell them i one 1 SEK|pg||
nt|xenya: and another grand for NS...|pg||
nt|vbman: a simple squeeze here for a grand|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: sorry all, the board are incorrect, this is board 6 :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 7NT here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not a good grand but makes on squeeze|pg||
nt|xenya: 36 hcp -- they just may bid it on sheer power |pg||
nt|vbman: cl brake heart quack dbleton pls a squeeze|pg||
nt|vbman: plus|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: so, this is board 6! that's why Norths pass will look strange|pg||
nt|werge: The problem is, that 3 ! h over 1 ! h is not the same as over 2 @H|pg||
nt|werge: 3 @h over 2 @h|pg||
nt|werge: Over 2 @H it must show a very big hand|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|henryb: and I don't need to jump to 2N because I never have the sort of takeout double East had.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yeah, this is not the set for predictions |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Looks like 5@d on S. W cannot attack @h|pg||
nt|joest: can n-s reach five diamonds?   needs a heart lead to beat it|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: that double looks odd|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not on @s!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ralfwil: With that @d support I had introduced my @s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cards friendly for spade contract|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not on S! I cannot spell....|pg||
nt|joest: was the 2@s overcall alerted?|pg||
nt|daman: partscore time|pg||
nt|viren169: be interesting how N/S cope with this hand...|pg||
nt|viren169: 1N by West?|pg||
nt|daman: N has a good Flannery hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: However that doesn't seem to be their system, to use it as preemptive and while I agree with the preemption theory it's pretty obvious they're not playing it.|pg||
nt|daman: yes 1NT would be the standard bid    11-14|pg||
nt|viren169: You dont need a stop in protective seat...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: or didn't have, in a manner of speaking|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That 7 down on board 13 ... you know I would have only predicted 6 down, and I would have been wrong again|pg||
nt|daman: hard to stop below game|pg||
nt|viren169: some specs saying no 1NT without a stop...|pg||
nt|hausigel: btw...|pg||
nt|hausigel: not sure what you have in mind. he has a big hand|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ralfwil: no|pg||
nt|werge: - but NOT that big|pg||
mb|p|nt|stoffers: :)|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|othered1: Then east has A98x and you've looked silly|pg||
nt|ralfwil: overbid from both hands?|pg||
nt|daman: you bid your hand    would be nice to have a stopper nut sometimes you aren't dealt one|pg||
nt|daman: but*|pg||
nt|viren169: Perhaps a dble by South would have worked well...|pg||
nt|hausigel: well, then you have a real problem finding 3NT if you cant ask for a stopper|pg||
nt|werge: Not a hand for game-forcing, which 3 @H would have shown|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@C?|pg||
nt|henryb: for example, with this East hand I would want my partner to bid 1@h after 1@c-X-1@d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would have bid a natural 2@S over 1@S. Am I alone?|pg||
nt|hausigel: in order to make 12 tricks legitimately in the previous board (after two tricks, that is)... |pg||
nt|hausigel: declarer needed to run the @DJ at some point, transferring the @D menace to East for a simple squeeze|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ralfwil: yes, but do you agree with 2@s?|pg||
nt|joest: I would make a t/o double of 3@c with the south hand|pg||
nt|hausigel: he has 8,5 playing tricks. sometimes you go down, but then you have to make a move|pg||
nt|hausigel: cant let them play 4@H like this|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the usa many play forcing to 3nt or 4 of a minor.|pg||
nt|werge: HM - I would have raised 3 @S even with a weaker hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree!|pg||
nt|joest: n-s have sold out way too cheaply|pg||
nt|santyclz: "A stopper is as good as it sounds."|pg||
nt|daman: double by South is not on the radar|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: sorry, miscounted the North hand.|pg||
nt|henryb: me too. and I would have raised 2@c to 3 with South|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5@C makes unless East leads a heart?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but South should raise to 3@C, as an obstructive measure|pg||
nt|viren169: max pass...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: They seem to have a thin but making game here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sheila a: Looks like the @c ruff will hold it|pg||
pc|dA|nt|odysseus69: spade guess needed for this and 4 spades- liable to get it right |pg||
nt|daman: now a trump|pg||
pc|d3|nt|joest: thismight work out if they are +50 here vs 5@d going down in the other room|pg||
nt|santyclz: I forget who said that.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ad then North might try 3@D....and they might get there|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The defence can't get their diamond trick, though|pg||
nt|sheila a: Right|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yeahhhh, we got the player names up now|pg||
nt|stoffers: should have taken it with the J to play a spade up|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South was facing 8-11 balanced.  It was reasonable to say No to the try|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @h10 was a nice card to see|pg||
nt|daman: @S 3-3 is helpful too|pg||
nt|mmmakela: OR didn't even bid 6 on the grand hand|pg||
nt|daman: amazing|pg||
nt|daman: always happens that way|pg||
nt|othered1: Unless east is way short of high cards promised, west may have overevaluated the minor honors.|pg||
nt|daman: starkist|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... bid it with confidence and hope!|pg||
nt|hausigel: I would have bid 1@S immediately|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|xenya: this looks enigmatic, but i'm sure they know what they are doing|pg||
nt|hausigel: on this line of play, East could keep declarer to 11 tricks by discarding his useless @H9|pg||
nt|hausigel: (not that it matters much at IMPs)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: If W knows that E can be soo weak, it´s an overbid and E is too weak for opening showing majors|pg||
nt|joest: this cannot be a doubleton or east wouldhave four hearts and bid them|pg||
nt|viren169: You just said it!|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|joest: it's now or never for the spade ruff|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: but that's a lot of mights|pg||
pc|h7|nt|odysseus69: luckily the diamonds break- should have won diamond in hand|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|santyclz: We'll tell our teammates that's what happened.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ralfwil: discard a @h|pg||
nt|othered1: West's action has been pretty consistent with his team's -- when only one team has bid ((and usually made) game, it's been LIrarna.|pg||
nt|xenya: to bid and make 2 grands in a session is quite an achievement|pg||
nt|werge: To have a chance to defeat 4 @S, you must play small @H now - and South must do the same, when he gets the @s Queen|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c8|nt|othered1: And the score reflects that|pg||
nt|daman: Edgar Kaplan I believe|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: no doubt he'll make it -- hard to see how he can go wrong here|pg||

nt|werge: Her good guessing can bring in 6 @h|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|werge: This time, E/W can bid a lot more - and make it|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will Sheng open|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: only part scores here it seems|pg||
nt|cindy: many players dont like to open 2C on two suiters but with kokish you can show two suits (if one of the suits is spades) easily|pg||
nt|keylime: W-E use a 14+ t 17 NT according to the convention card I have for them:|pg||

nt|keylime: http://www.bridge.dk/landskamp03/cc/bertens-bakkeren.pdf|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you mean, if the opps don;t crowd you. but that is the reason why players don;t like to open 2C with 2-suiters in the first place|pg||
nt|petergill: EW are playing Precision, hence the bidding of the previous hand. |pg||
nt|werge: But a @d-lead kills you|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: yes i know|pg||
nt|keylime: I had to go retrieve a guest downstairs :-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Horwitz wants to bid -- but  nothing available|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: There is a very heated director call in the other match so players finding it had to concentrate|pg||
nt|vlad9:  4he has some problems here on a spade lead|pg||
mb|2H|nt|2hplus4: @C lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and he/she survived|pg||
nt|werge: Here only the bidding has interest|pg||
nt|npcjpn: twelve tricks.|pg||
nt|werge: - 6 @c being ice-cold|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C 10-15, long clubs|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|keylime: she survived the 25 story ride in a really cramped elevator thankfully :-)|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D artificial enquiry, at least game-try strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Most experts around here respond with the South hand.  There is minimal playing strength but passing mades life so easy for the opponents.|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 2NT seems like a lot to bid on that hand|pg||
nt|vlad9:  sry  cl leads I meant|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cindy: i wouldnt bid with S hand |pg||
nt|cindy: too dangerous for me|pg||
nt|sybarra: was just going to make same comment |pg||
nt|marlowepi: but this is cold on the intrafinesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: seemed really optimistic|pg||
nt|npcjpn: but it may not so easy, 3@c does not promise a solid suit.|pg||
nt|boedhy: this is high|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but might get a @S lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: strange choice for 3NT but will work :)|pg||
nt|vlad9:  ty for watching carefully:)|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Easy mistake to make. I've done it often :)|pg||
nt|vlad9:  right:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mariner1: 2N will not fare well here ,,,,, to much out and off|pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart king, then D to the 9|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - my firt name is Hans|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, even with the spade lead, later a low heart switch from South will give declarer a guess which is impossible to get right.|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C = a pile of rubbish, 3NT = hopeful|pg||
pc|d3|nt|keylime: I have nightmares of -500 in a partial with South's hand|pg||
nt|cindy: or 800 :)|pg||
nt|keylime: at least they are 5-5 and not a frisky 5-4 as some would have|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would bid. |pg||
nt|allanr44: @DK will make this very difficult|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|keylime: 2nt is pushing a bit with the weak diamond suit|pg||
nt|mrdct: this could be a good result horwitz - NS can makea few @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this won't be as easy as the @C games|pg||
pc|h2|nt|swanson: If you Google Yeh 2009 you can find the site for the tournament.|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.yehcup09.com.au/  - Tournament site|pg||
nt|keylime: I think to be fair, it depends on the NT defense|pg||
nt|keylime: if you're a DONT user - 2@d fits the bill |pg||
nt|npcjpn: so depends on a lead.|pg||
nt|werge: Dangerous board here for E/W - if the play trandfer in OR|pg||
nt|bobholl: strange thta 2@S  denies @H support uncommon :) ?|pg||
nt|allanr44: not in 4   lol|pg||
nt|werge: tranSfer|pg||
pc|h8|nt|werge: Difficult to find the @s-lead|pg||
nt|npcjpn: bravo!|pg||
nt|werge: Voila - as the say in France|pg||
pc|h9|nt|swanson: Declarer might will guess diamonds - after all SOuth did pass 1@H.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome Dave!|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|swanson: well|pg||
nt|mariner1: that is the Yeh Cup site|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you could have a game opposite very little. and when you have this shape it is unlikely they will double before bidding something|pg||
nt|cindy: i wouldnt bid no matter what|pg||
nt|allanr44: now the trump finesse and the double spade finesse works, but would fail on a D lead (for 6 that is)|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Possible 2 trumps and 2 black kings to lose|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 1 trump|pg||
nt|2hplus4: now|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|cindy: partner is passed hand and we are red|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|mariner1:  http://www.qldbridge.com/gcc/           - Tournament Site|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club ace , club and N is down|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes the @S switch on the previous bd allowed the game to keep|pg||
nt|bobholl: up to 8 sure tricks now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: Ouch - |pg||
nt|boedhy: Can probably take his time for it....|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @S2 must be indicating @D honour|pg||
nt|petergill: The longer Ou thinks, the more declarer might work out what Ou is thinking about|pg||
nt|petergill: a heart is the only chance - declarer must hhve a top @d on the bidding|pg||
nt|boedhy: very interesting moment|pg||
nt|petergill: inserting @H10 is normal on a low heart, but we will see|pg||
nt|boedhy: these penalty (in soccer) moments happen a lot in Bridge thats why I like it so much|pg||
nt|vlad9:  declarer guessed right but Im not sure the play was correct|pg||
nt|vlad9:  he could lose 3 trums theseway|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|swanson: The @D8 discard will chinch it.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: do we know what the problem is Fiona ?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|d5|nt|keylime: I'm swayed by what pard does admittedly. I'm use to opening light in my regular p'ship; his pass probably sways me here instead of me tabling 2@d (which is diamonds and hearts for ...|pg||
nt|keylime: us)|pg||
nt|bobholl: this looks like a safer line :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|sunsamvar: the interesting boards are coming up. so hold on to the edge of your seats|pg||
nt|boedhy: ai he missed|pg||
nt|petergill: He played @HK to see if partner encouraged - not good enough - to get 5 tricks, a low heart was the only chance. |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|allanr44: yes|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes. Not clear but should rise with @SA to make sure of contract|pg||
pc|h4|nt|swanson: So 5 diamonds and one in each of the other suits for declarer.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it seems very anti-percentage to start with the ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|petergill: Ouch, Ou and Chan missed|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|bobholl: nice battle for 9th trick :)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the very fact that you are vul means that partner's top end is higher. here you would be a favorite to make game oppsite Qxxxx of hearts|pg||
nt|npcjpn: but North has to find six discard....|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|santyclz: He pitched a @d from dummy.|pg||
nt|janm: Still looks as if this is going down (only 4 diamonds, since declarer pitched one on a heart)|pg||
nt|cindy: all of my partners open anything that moves so we might miss a part score but thats ok with me|pg||
nt|sybarra: and home now |pg||
nt|boedhy: Not easy to get it right but I agree with Peter that it was probably his only change|pg||
nt|bobholl: with 52 crds open easy now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: E opened the bidding, so it can;t be wrong to start with a D to the 9 and see what happens|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: can Peter divine the @C position?|pg||
pc|cK|pg||

nt|joest: we'll see how high they get in the open room :)|pg||
nt|daman: we remind the specs that the score is wrong due to an input error on Board 14|pg||
nt|werge: A quiet 4 @S here|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|ralfwil: he went down????|pg||
nt|joest: but I'm not sure I'd be comfortable entering only +50 on my private score|pg||
nt|daman: so take 12 away from Zang and you have the corect score|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: urk|pg||
nt|cuttysark: You need a solid suit for a weak 2...|pg||
nt|henryb: suit quality!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now there's a suit where you have to travel a long way before it becomes solid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can they reach small slam?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Andersson is a magician. He made 12 tricks on 17!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: (he did not)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But it's not so easy with that claim button|pg||
nt|daman: operator...is that the correct result?|pg||
nt|daman: the old 4 card major system|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|santyclz: Wow, big bid.|pg||
mb|d!|nt|ralfwil: As the cards lies 13 tricks in @s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 1NT = 12-14|pg||
nt|daman: I like 1NT|pg||
nt|viren169: That will keep E/W out of the hearts!|pg||
nt|werge: Can North now stop at game-level?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I guess 3@H shows a minimum?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: D! ????|pg||
nt|daman: N will probably lead a @S|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|odysseus69: perfect fit- difficult for West to move|pg||
nt|daman: doink|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... seems normal|pg||
nt|santyclz: I guess he's seen his pd's overcalls before.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 2NT must be minors.  A bit questionable, but there you go|pg||
nt|ralfwil: saved by the bell!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sheila a: I'd prefer to be 5-5|pg||
nt|daman: has at least 7 tricks|pg||
nt|santyclz: Of course we would all have led a @c, but seriously folks...|pg||
nt|viren169: Lead is 2nd highest from bad suits|pg||
nt|viren169: Do we still agree with 8 from 987xx?|pg||
nt|viren169: if not what would you lead?|pg||
nt|viren169: Any comments whilst we wait?|pg||
nt|viren169: Comments from specs welcomed?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I'm told "everyone" now plays that double for takeout.  Everyone but me and my partners, I'd guess.|pg||
nt|daman: yes    a @C stands out|pg||
nt|viren169: at least 8 tricks|pg||
nt|daman: operator    West did not duck the Spade|pg||
nt|santyclz: Undo please oper.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|henryb: now cold|pg||
nt|ady: can ruff 2 clubs and play for hearts 3-2|pg||
nt|henryb: I think it might have been cold on any lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think so - a club lead forces your line, on this lead there are alternatives|pg||
nt|sheila a: This wil be hard work for declarer, especially on that lead|pg||
nt|othered1: Why you'd want to bid again, takeout or otherwise, is another question.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Geoffrey Wolfarth|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|mmmakela: wrong cards here or 1 @S=hearts|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sheila a: Hallo!|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me - I have already shown my strength. Let partner decide|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: will they find the grand?|pg||
nt|daman: sure|pg||
nt|daman: grand salami|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - but if West had bid 3 @H, North might have been interested in some fun|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: more chance with slower approach- maybe playing drury would give them a chance|pg||
nt|sheila a: I think N should have played a third @h to force declarer|pg||
nt|othered1: Perhaps north implied some cards by passing 1N, then south's double for takeout would feel better to me.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|ralfwil: On a board like this, it´s importanr do que the @sK|pg||
nt|mmmakela: where did it go wrong?|pg||
nt|joest: killing the entry for the late pitch on the diamond|pg||
nt|hausigel: I guess I would try 3@H but then settle for 4@S if partner doesnt show any extras|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: they didn´t realize they had a @s fit|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|cuttysark: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/league/division.php?action=view&id=1865  for standing after round 6 of 9|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: big swing|pg||
nt|mmmakela: why not 4 @S instead of 4 NT?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion W must bid 5@h also showing first controls in minors and E can upgrade with @cK and the goos @s support|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|roswolf: this is not a healthy choice for declarer|pg||
nt|sheila a: We're not entirely convinced this is strictly how the play went|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i know the feeling|pg||

nt|marlowepi: and while we are speaking of the colors, E has opened a NT at favorable, which could be anything, especially for a dutch pair|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still - as Dave said, this could be good against NS @S partscore|pg||
nt|petergill: Shih's optimistic bidding was justified - defence is not easy|pg||
nt|vlad9:  noone should argue with success |pg||
mb|1C!|nt|swanson: North will be under the miguided assumption that this deal belongs to his side.|pg||
nt|cindy: i know |pg||
nt|keylime: very true Marshall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm a 2@D bidder -- how about you Dave?|pg||
nt|mrdct: the @S suit likely to prevail here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@H has play here EW...... no Save NS|pg||
nt|bobholl: this last 3nt migth gain a lot|pg||
nt|allanr44: It will be interesting to see what happens in the other room.|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|marlowepi: which means, i think, that the odds on bidding are nowhere near as terrifying as has been suggested|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lol   i thought they were in 3NT. to me it looks so automatic for N to bid 3NT over 2NT that i didnt even bother to check the rest of the auction|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: not sure what problem is :) In the Cayne match|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: micheals. most use micheals for weak(below opening hand) or 16 + hands.|pg||
nt|forni: looks like 4@S by NS|pg||
nt|boedhy: this will feel Bad for Good Ball |pg||
nt|vlad9:  soon this will end in 3nt|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mrdct: not a great @D suit but there are 6 of them so 2@D looks OK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when able to make overcall in suit just under opening bid -- because of preemptive value, it can be weaker than other 2 level overcalls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S a practical bid -- with EW showing 8+@S partner strong favorite to have some @S length|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think gill needs to bid again with this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  EW 8+@H -- but you knew that|pg||
nt|werge: If thisd is a weak-two - this beats the world record|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cindy: terrifying for me   i would bid if that outside stuff were in my long suits|pg||
nt|mrdct: even though he is red vs green|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the north hand falls in between and most wd call the suits in turn|pg||
nt|forni: but|pg||
nt|werge: Here 4 @S is making N/S with only 16 HCP|pg||
nt|forni: I'm wrong|pg||
nt|allanr44: part score here|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: I'd like the K@c in my diamonds. Then I'm bidding freely.|pg||
nt|forni: 3 rounds of @H will promote @SJ|pg||
nt|werge: 300 is not part score...|pg||
nt|bobholl: pass 1nt 2nt ?|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|marlowepi: moreover, bidding VASTLY increases the chances that PARTNER will get to be on lead, which is a very good thing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would he still bid 2D if he had 250 honors?|pg||
nt|sybarra: should we pour you another glass of wine?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, pleaseeeeeeeeeeeee|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: how many votes for 3nt and how many for 4@H with the south hand ?|pg||
nt|werge: Yes, 3 rounds of H ist the killing defence - when East ruffs with the @S Jack|pg||
nt|allanr44: true Hans  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: interesting -- when i began reading books/magazines from England "green" meant favorable vulnerability|pg||
nt|mrdct: trump lead by gill might be best - althogh he has a slight problem in that department|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  not-vul vs vu|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now that i know of other parts of the world - they use it "green" = not-vul|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|cindy: was 2H forcing by N ?|pg||
nt|keylime: I have a glass of Lake Anna Sunset currently in hand|pg||
nt|npcjpn: probably with 2@d multi, 2@h shows sound weak two. |pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: EW will probably think that N was kidding with the 1NT bid|pg||
nt|keylime: but I wonder if they are playing IJO's|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT Precision so about 13-15 I think|pg||
nt|werge: 1 @S is a part...|pg||
nt|allanr44: hmmm|pg||
nt|werge: But no 300 now!|pg||
nt|werge: West knows, that N/S are in an 8-card-fit|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 @C losers 2@S a @D and what more ?|pg||
nt|werge: 2600|pg||
nt|vlad9:  2cl = stayman  in this position|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cindy: not liking 3H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what did S think 2D was? if she couldn;t open the bidding surely she couldn;t bid 3H on a misfit, so she must have thought 2D was something else|pg||
nt|cindy: im happy defending |pg||
nt|werge: 260, I mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 5@C DBL would have been 500 however N has to much defense to save|pg||
nt|mrdct: north might put the @HJ on the tbale now|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 053|pg||
nt|npcjpn: sorry, private.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 3@c promises some values with 2NT lebensohl.|pg||
nt|bobholl: they migth stop here and make|pg||
nt|allanr44: 2@C?|pg||
nt|bobholl: same question as before 1 or 2nt |pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: 5@d looks to be a decent spot here|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy: and probably with those early two good games for Yeh will not be happy at all.|pg||
nt|petergill: @H9 discouraging, to deny @HJ|pg||
nt|boedhy: Although those boards didnt loose points but they need to get on the score board..|pg||
nt|werge: Suppose East had (had) an opening bid, you would be happy to bid and plays 3 NT now|pg||
nt|bobholl: kind of missed manche 2@S :)|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Don't know why he is using Stayman with those @S Danger of ruff in 4@H if partner fits|pg||
nt|vlad9:  spade spots are not good enough for defence|pg||
pc|cT|nt|swanson: Unsupported aces are not often good leads, but here there is a reasonable chance that either the king is in dummy or that North can give partner a ruff.|pg||
nt|santyclz: @c continuation makes this very tough if possible at all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H before touching trump to ensure 2 or 3 ruffs in dummy|pg||
nt|werge: 3 NT and 5 @C both should make|pg||
nt|allanr44: yep|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mrdct: west probably not keen on playing a trump from Qxx now|pg||
nt|mrdct: all very much looking like an easy make now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now play is just for overtrick|pg||
pc|c2|nt|keylime: pushes as expected on boards 1 and 2 hence the no score.|pg||
nt|sybarra: esp. when I know what to lead |pg||
nt|ahollan1: mid @S looks automatic -- if Gill follows suit, no harm|pg||
nt|forni: Ohno will take the lead by ending in 4@S on board 14, where Gill went down one in 5@S|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|petergill: A club back works best, but a diamond back is more likely. |pg||
nt|petergill: Shen deliberately lost the club into the safe hand who cannot attack @H profitably|pg||
nt|boedhy: the only board were they think they will win points 3NT -3 will loose 3 because of their partners being in 5@d (not doubled luckly enough) minus 4|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes nice early club play to non dangerous opp|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT will make - declarer will double-finesse in spades later, if he has to |pg||
nt|petergill: For me, it's nice to see Mr Yeh's team winning, because I played in the Yeh Cup (sponsored and run by Mr Yeh, US$165,000 prizemoney) last month - most of the participants would ...|pg||
nt|petergill: agree that iti s probably the best event in the world to play in. |pg||
nt|boedhy: but wonders happen they won an imp on the last board partners were in 3NT also normal contract I suppose...........And made an uptrick with the @h lead...............|pg||
nt|vlad9:  uff - this lead means pd - I heard you but I dont care|pg||
nt|2hplus4: A @C lead is hoping for a miracle Partner has the points and he said lead a @S|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugrapha3: some music started playing outside so play stopped :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: diamonds are forever :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Ou likes to think things through. Not many clues about what to play next. |pg||
pc|s2|nt|cindy: 3/2 diamonds makes it easy|pg||
nt|bobholl: 8 tricks now but no more|pg||
pc|s3|nt|keylime: I asked Larry, who's my regular pard about the 5-5 red hand, he states he's coming in due to decent loser count. Ironically, he's more conservative than I am most of the time. :-)|pg||
nt|cindy: would anyone lead the K of hearts with W hand ?|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|mariner1: now a @c and defense prevails|pg||
nt|petergill: Nice card, @C7, correctly won by @CK|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: if nobody is dancing -- it doesn't count|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: keep the dangerous east out|pg||
nt|werge: Why the 10 of @H?|pg||
nt|vlad9:  I dont like the Q of spades by declarer eighter  - one entry to dummy is wasted|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sunsamvar: once the @S king was seen with east he can be sure that the @C top honours are with west..|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: S buys a dummy for 3H that is about two tricks better than par on this auction|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so good safety play|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|2hplus4: @H9 suggests he wants this deal over quickly|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: now for the spade finesses|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|keylime: B3: 4@h got doubled and racked for 690|pg||
nt|cindy: yep|pg||
nt|keylime: I wonder if North was catering to South's somewhat yo-yo tendencies|pg||
nt|marlowepi: oy-oy tendencies?|pg||
nt|cindy: :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: i dont think yamada has the timing for a trump coup here|pg||
nt|werge: By the way we are informed, that East showed 8-11 HCP|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|nt|bobholl: don't understand either|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|boedhy: Yes Peter my good friend Bas Drijver (who won it ) told me he liked it very much|pg||
nt|allanr44: 9 now|pg||
nt|bobholl: 9 of @H now 9 tricks 3nt missed :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: judging by his look he definately wants it over :) |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: i've heard that at the Gold Coast Congress finding party is NEVER difficult|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cindy: hmm|pg||
nt|cindy: that didnt turn out so well|pg||
nt|marlowepi: did you ask curly?|pg||
nt|keylime: did declarer really duck there?|pg||
nt|mrdct: one entry short|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c3|nt|mariner1: good defense will score here|pg||
nt|swanson: THe opening bid and raise by East was somewhere in the 'weak' to 'pitiful' category so he should be surprised to be taking a minus score.|pg||
nt|swanson: should not be|pg||
nt|mariner1: we move again now........ 3 board rounds|pg||
nt|nickf: I suppose EW will move to NS here|pg||
nt|mariner1: so it looks like our EW become NS each round|pg||
nt|swanson: Matheson-Cormack had only one below par result in the six boards we saw, board 4 and that should be only a bit below average.  Good start for them.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Two ladies have just sat down now.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|werge: I repeat: With the West hand - after the bidding by N/S - you must bid GAME!|pg||

nt|vugraphzkz: Karlsson: only problem on the last hand was me counting to 13|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sheila a: So this hand is too strong for 1@s?|pg||
mb|d|nt|bjacobs: Yes, that would be 8-11|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Did 4@S go 3 down on 17?|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: ah we have an "unusual"system in play?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: We do ...|pg||
nt|sheila a: Yes, it's a thrilling strong pass method|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|ralfwil: Prhaps he could draw some conclusions of tge lead. 5@s, 1@d probably 4@c and 3@h. Therefore play the 2 tophonours and then @d|pg||
nt|joest: now I don't get this|pg||
nt|joest: the last time thsi pair had this sequence north had a 16 count|pg||
nt|joest: this time a 12 count|pg||

nt|daman: make*|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: NS play Pass= 0-7 or 17+, 1C 12-16 any, 1NT 12-14. Other bid in first or second position 8-11 (1D bal, 4441 or 4*major+longer minor. 1H/S 5+Major, 2C/D 5+ minor no major and 2 H 55 ...|pg||

nt|bjacobs: in majors). Response to Pass (i.e. opening in third or fourth same as second, but 1C 0-7 or 16+, 1 NT 15-17 and 8-11 opening are 8-15).|pg||
nt|ralfwil: It´s only in Roman blackwood you can show 2 black or red kings what I can remember|pg||
nt|joest: i know I"m missing something :)|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|henryb: not me. I raise to 2@s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the trouble is that 5 level was not safe - give East the heart king and not the club king and....|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - but West should play a small @C, he ought to know. that there was never more than one trick for the defence|pg||
nt|hausigel: skip stayman anyone?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: me too|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty for info|pg||
nt|sheila a: I wonder if W thought 2@c was forcing?|pg||
nt|joest: a perfect fitter that is cold for 6NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: Interesting lead problem.  (Not that it matters.)|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|bjacobs: E/W have missed their 25 point 3NT, but they will have the last laugh|pg||
nt|roswolf: in unusual system bidding i play cuebids of opps real suit are the only forcing sequences|pg||
nt|bjacobs: makes sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: nice play from East on this hand... not so nice if pd has 6 clubs!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Or kjxxx for that matter.|pg||
nt|viren169: It is West that should duck the 2nd club....|pg||
nt|daman: my Mom would have played the Ace and returned the suit|pg||
nt|santyclz: Right.|pg||
nt|viren169: And you Mom would be right! I am not going to argue with ur Mom!|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't think we're stuck, I think we're lost.|pg||

pc|h2|nt|ady: looks like down 1|pg||
nt|sheila a: Is there a case for W doubling the initial 1@c to show a weak balanced hand?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: certainly worth a thought|pg||
pc|hK|nt|werge: Sorry - I was sleping, mixing things up: ALWAYS Stayman, but not if we have around 28-28 together|pg||
nt|hausigel: I can hardly picture a hand less suitable for a suit contract|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@s must be the final contract. N knows nothing about @cKJ|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|Walddk4: You need time to prepare a proper defence of course, but they had. System cards submitted well in advance|pg||
nt|bjacobs: although since 1@C is legitimate in strength, if not shape, perhaps it's worth just treating it like a "short club"|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: and must be satisfied with the table!!|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: passing just looks wrong|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In a natural system you will open with 1@c and after that it´s easy 1@c - 1@s - 3@h (void), 4@c....|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 11 tricks. 1 trick lost in @d or @c|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: now can make|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk4: And Sweden is not a country of restrictions (as opposed to some other countries)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bridgewise that is|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I guess Bill approves since Australia has the same policy|pg||
nt|bjacobs: good on 'em|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I do ... as long as there are rules relating to preparation time|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|cuttysark: Seems the diamond ruff has gone a-begging|pg||

pc|c2|nt|cuttysark: Or not!|pg||
pc|d2|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: East has paid a mighty price for his inactivity|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Too late. Pretty irrelevant in light of the result from the CR - good effort, 3NT after the spade overcall|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good bid - partner has values plus a spade stop, and you have seven tricks  |pg||
nt|henryb: the defense might have been sharper in the other room|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed, but it is never easy not ot lead your good suit|pg||
nt|ady: will be new leader|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|cuttysark: The Blue team lost 13 imps on the previous board by playing in 3NT, but stuck with their policy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why not try @hKQx?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|joest: i'm not sure they were on firm ground getting here but they're definitely in a good spot no matter how they got here :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|henryb: interesting problem at trick 1 for N on a @s lead. do you duck and hopw part has the @dA or win and play partner for good lower @d|pg||

nt|keylime: nope, no curly :-)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: yes.... she is upset...|pg||
nt|cindy: did she say  ohno ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep - trying to reduce trump to equal West's length|pg||
nt|bobholl: but than they always :) lead @D|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|vugrapha3: yes|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: The Irish and Americans have been having a few parties :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both 5@C contracts have picked up double digit swings|pg||
nt|boedhy: Not bad at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: in the open room, 6NT was made, so new leader.|pg||
nt|werge: A quiet on here - 600 at both tables|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: important for South to not overly press due to the potential 10 imp loss|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 2 @h forcing and nat ?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 2@H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: @h and a minor |pg||
mb|2N|nt|mrdct: possible tricky @S contract for EW here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: micheals again|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: What was so special in the Yeh Cup Peter apart from the generous prize money ?|pg||
nt|werge: But it´s hard work|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Certainly has that!|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: at least 55 5-10 points|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Americans partying cause summer in OZ|pg||
nt|mrdct: right-sided now|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: major suit battle developing here|pg||
nt|npcjpn: after a @H lead from South.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: 2@S guarantees 4-card support  [DBL=3@S]|pg||
nt|mrdct: i was up there for the Yeh Cup and can certainly attest to the fact that the Amercian bridge players know how to party|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: both 4  @H and 4@S makes although there are only 18 total tricks as per the LAW|pg||
nt|boedhy: top attendance, top accomodation|pg||
nt|petergill: The defence to beat 5@D = @h ruff - is not easy to find. |pg||
nt|boedhy: he told me but Peter was there|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Weak NT and 3NT on the strength of the good diamond suit|pg||
nt|swanson: This will work out very well for N-S.  Unlucky for East to not be able to enter the auction.|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to guess to cash @D to make this|pg||
nt|mariner1: interestingly any card from dummy works here|pg||
nt|werge: The 9th trick shall come from the @C-auit...|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: very deep position to play E for 4 diamonds, which was obviously the plan from the getgo. it is not as if W bid 3S. anyway if she was thinking about that deep play, maybe she ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: should cash heart ace first just in case something interesting happens. when king falls, she can cash other top trump then ruff spade|pg||
nt|keylime: I think once the K@h falls under the ace, 4-1 trumps becomes more unlikely|pg||
nt|forni: hrm... this isn't the right contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Assuming S goes right in diamonds, which seems likely, this will be a great result for NS - not only bidding & making 3NT but an overtrick because of the lead|pg||
nt|swanson: Not finessing has the disadvantage of losing the remainder of the daimond tricks should Qxx be onside - but after the opponents run clubs there woudln't be many diamond tricks to ...|pg||
nt|swanson: take anyway.|pg||
nt|sybarra: how do "we"  (e/w) land in clubs?|pg||
nt|keylime: I think the club suit's been lost for 20 years Shirley...or more|pg||
nt|sybarra: or do they need to |pg||
nt|cindy: not by bidding 2S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think they better stay where they are|pg||
nt|cindy: i cant relate|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Bakkeren in the tank again|pg||
nt|sybarra: had several suggestion, of X with E  IF  east is going to bid|pg||
nt|npcjpn: after a strength showing redouble, direct 2@h shows (sub)-minimum opening.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: tough situation for Ish.|pg||
nt|2hplus4: May give declarer the information to make his contract though|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cindy: dont understand the tank either|pg||
nt|sybarra: tank=thinking|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@S looks quite managable - but with some skillful play 4@S is a chance here despite the 4-1 break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: selling out when opp known to hold 8@S may convince Gill that trump are 41|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D was freely bid, hence 5@D|pg||
nt|boedhy: Played from the west side it is virtually impossible |pg||
pc|d6|nt|keylime: I don't think you can cash two clubs tho after the K@h falls|pg||
nt|mrdct: "skillful" in this case means picking where the @SQ is|pg||
nt|petergill: Spotlight is on Ou's lead - again|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @s lead will pressurise declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: @HK is not impossible - EW figure to have very few clubs. |pg||
nt|boedhy: He will not underlead his ace even if he would have read Lawrence books :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: ;0|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|keylime: to get some information about how trumps might be breaking|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably this is rock-bottom for the 2NT range|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double with only one defensive trick understandably did not appeal to E|pg||
nt|cindy: i know   what could he be thinking about|pg||
nt|sybarra: what in the "h!@@@@  |pg||
nt|sybarra: pard has|pg||
nt|sybarra: to be bidding|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @C LEAD|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: otherwise it makes i think|pg||
nt|forni: "normally", s would open 1@C and N would bid 1NT over west's overcall.|pg||
nt|petergill: sorry, I forgot it was North on lead|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mariner1: over tricks really count in MP however they don't hurt in Imps Across the Field either|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, he was thinking about NT. he does have an opening hand with a fit and  3 stoppers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL + pass of 2@S must put Q in North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- "must" is a 4-letter word|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: " twenty minutes left"|pg||
nt|2hplus4: It's dangerous when you don't win the auction after making a 2 suited bid|pg||
pc|dK|nt|werge: West shall false-card with the @h 9 - South might finesse East for the Jack|pg||
nt|forni: "the end"|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cindy: his partner couldnt bid over 1N|pg||
nt|keylime: I'm surprised that a double didn't come flying out from West here|pg||
nt|mrdct: he probably wont try to set up @C before drawing trumps given that he's only in 2@S|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: NOW EASY|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: sry for caps|pg||
nt|boedhy: still has to do some work...small @d will work best now|pg||
nt|werge: It seems, that a @H-lead kills 3 NT|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|keylime: pard balanced red on white|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: I think W just happy to be defending |pg||
nt|cindy: my head is spinning|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: u need an exorcist|pg||
nt|sybarra: you are right on that Dwayne|pg||
nt|sybarra: but knowing the dutch as I do, they balance on air,  so that is why W in the tank no doubt|pg||
nt|petergill: Need to draw trumps, then carefully lead thrice towards @HQJ10x - entries to West hand are a problem. |pg||
nt|boedhy: thought the same but needed to play high @d for that not low......|pg||
nt|petergill: South wins first heart, North ducks 2nd heart, the play is very interesting|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: indeed|pg||
nt|petergill: Need to play a heart right now I think in order to make it!|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, a low @d instead of @DQ would have been more revealing - when @DK pops up, it must be singleton, making an early heart play without drawing the last trump safe!|pg||
nt|petergill: Need to lead towards @HQJ10x three times so need to play a heart now - else one entry short.  |pg||
nt|petergill: A World Champion might get this right - mere mortals would draw the last trump and fail. |pg||
nt|petergill: A great hand, this one|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: establish the side suit when there is work to be done they say...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|keylime: declarer doesn't know about the friendly spade layout either|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it would seem more promising to lead a low diamond at trick 2|pg||
nt|allanr44: It looks like he'll have to play for a favourable diamond lie now|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|janm: Oops|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh well|pg||
nt|keylime: I think West has to smack the 3@h counterbalance here to teach a lesson|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well there is a block in @D|pg||
nt|werge: @D to the 10 - and small (and fast)from West|pg||
nt|allanr44: this is now very tough|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sunsamvar: and this hand is a geat example|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: W should have ducked that D trick|pg||
nt|petergill: Wow - great play!|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: who knows, maybe declarer will return to hand & play another D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: If anything interesting happens -- we have frequent Japan non-playing captain available - welcome Nobuyuki Hayashi|pg||
nt|npcjpn: hi, everyone.|pg||
nt|2hplus4: @H shift was more interesting|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|petergill: Superb declarer play by Mr Shih - no wonder he won the World Championship last year in Beijing (the Transnational Mixed Teams, in the winning Yeh Bros Team).|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sunsamvar: east must take @Dk and shift to @C w/o cashing the spade|pg||
nt|werge: Very important, that West keeps the communication open - otherwise, South might win by dropping the @H Q|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|werge: Please change the two 2´s...|pg||
pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: NS are not vul, and N bid 3H voluntarily, not under pressure. yes, E did bid vul, but not immediately, and also he did NOT balance with double. meanwhile W has the WORST shape to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: have when you have a trump stack, and a huge proportion of the time when you reveal the locus of the trump stack it costs you a trick. i can understand the pass by W|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3nt would not have helped in this case|pg||
nt|bobholl: only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: entry for @S Q gone now :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bobholl: what's the better chance @H ace singleton with 2 @H or @C 4-2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: where else could W be hoping to get a setting trick from?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: crunch time|pg||
nt|werge: by East|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|npcjpn: this NS pairs have been central of bridge of Japan.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mariner1: kibber reminding me what Aunt Mattie says|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer's play was reasonable, if ineffective.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|forni: trouble now.|pg||
nt|forni: W lead his smallest spade, probably 4th best...|pg||
nt|forni: so Peake was looking for the segging trick.|pg||
nt|forni: setting*|pg||
nt|petergill: A great example of the need to stop and think before drawing all the trumps!|pg||
nt|allanr44: not very well judged|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mrdct: problem for gill now is that he can only get to dummy one more time|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so ohno may pick up some imps here|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good ply all round|pg||
nt|werge: ow only 3 hands are playinge|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|keylime: I don't get the spade exit either because it speaks a lot about the layout|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 @D|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mariner1: Aunt Mattie said, "eight ever, nine never"........|pg||
nt|swanson: E-W evidently managed to block the club suit.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|idblu: hi Larry, how's everything :)|pg||
nt|werge: Correctly played - if @D behave|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|allanr44: yes, and well defended|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Still should make it by eventually ducking a @H and endplaying N in @S|pg||
nt|vlad9:  a good news for the trailing team on board 6 |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|h3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mrdct: twice now!|pg||

nt|werge: West knew my old rule: Never take a trick, if you do´nt have a reason to do it|pg||
pc|s6|nt|keylime: the spade is to me, an almost give up play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: generally speaking, the probable result if you double on this auction is +100, with some chance for 300. is it worth it?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: yes, i already mentioned that a D seems obvious at trick 2|pg||

nt|odysseus69: the old debate about 5-5 in blacks- |pg||
nt|sheila a: These swedes really need a few lessons in declarer play :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it is good to have such freedom - in Australia recently there were some unusual systems and methods i came across - a lot imo had no intrinsic merit but it is fun to see the ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: wheels go round|pg||
nt|ralfwil: game in @s or @h. Which do you prefer?|pg||
nt|joest: so 4@h was permitted to make on board 6|pg||
nt|joest: but n-s has a good result on board 7|pg||
nt|viren169: Well done N/S!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: bd is also wrong :(|pg||
nt|santyclz: Krishna Chakravartula explains the o/r bidding:  2@s opening hand with @s short, 3@s confirming shape with @s void, 4@d rkc response...:)|pg||
nt|xenya: so they did bid 3N on the previous one?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: something is wrong with the set, i have no idea what|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|mmmakela: if no dias lead spades better|pg||
nt|daman: NS will slither into 4@S and make it on the @H finesse|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|othered1: South has lots of honors, few honor tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The highest contract looks like 3@d|pg||
nt|othered1: would 2N be natural?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: 2 black tricks for e/w  in heart contract|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They opened 3@H in the other room - revolting but effective :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Víctor, but AQ10xx is better than A98xx|pg||
nt|mmmakela: mixed raise maybe|pg||
nt|joest: these guys play SUPER SOUND weak twos or maybe so-called "Roth" twos|pg||
nt|viren169: Nice 5@C sac by West though!|pg||
nt|viren169: unluck to go down 1|pg||
nt|santyclz: To show my age, I wouldn't open n with a weak 2.  4 cards in other major, void.  Either I might tolerate but not both.|pg||
nt|viren169: Me neither...|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|sheila a: System experimentation is all part of the fun|pg||
nt|werge: They have their fun...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: n/s also likely to be pushed to 5@H    |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, they win via unfamiliarity, but if you restrict them too much, then you are not resolving the problem of unfamiliarity|pg||
nt|othered1: It would be nice to bid a voluntary, but very limited 3@D|pg||
nt|joest: 2NT = lebensohl; a weak hand getting ready to sign off in 3@d|pg||
nt|viren169: Now id 2N lebensohl here or minors?|pg||
nt|hausigel: would declarer have guessed the trumps?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mdgraham: maybe not, now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: It´s easier to show these suits if opps interfear|pg||
nt|daman: 3@D was a form of Bergen|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: ok 11 and next|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree. I once played against a pair who held 4-5 to 6-3 in majors The 10-card @s was never mentioned and 4@h  -1|pg||
nt|hausigel: probably not...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: It's a paradox, of sorts|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Yes, too many restrictions kill bridge. You can't get new youngsters to the game if you impose restrictions. "Welcome guys, but you can't play this and that". That's no fun for ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: them|pg||
nt|viren169: Now E/W will sac over 4@S|pg||
nt|daman: South might pass|pg||
nt|daman: 4333 13 count|pg||
nt|santyclz: Would you really bid 4@s with s over a weak 2?|pg||
nt|werge: But which other lead was possible?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|othered1: This should be worth a couple of hundred to NS, a plus position|pg||
nt|othered1: But really these small pick-ups are way too little and way too late in thematch.|pg||
nt|joest: on a heart lead 5@d would have made.  we'll never know....|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@S for me..|pg||
nt|daman: uh uh|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: 5@S  2 down|pg||
pc|h6|nt|viren169: I would have bid 4@H (pass or correct) over 2@D dble|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|daman: N is at fault    South bid their hand    N shd bid 3@H over 3@C to make up for his bidding blunder|pg||
nt|viren169: keep opps under control!|pg||
nt|daman: you can't bid like that Gad     you have nada really|pg||
nt|daman: what are you looking for?  an advance psuedo?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|santyclz: @dk (against 2@ss.)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: well this contract is doomed|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ady: should east have doubled 3@H|pg||
nt|joest: north is going to be able to lead his second spade up (with the @h7 as an entry) and west can never get in to push a club through|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: Lebensohl struck again. for me it´s easy to bid 3@d on W|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ralfwil: I dont like that defence!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N is lucky, that this return can´t pickup all @s by W|pg||
nt|ralfwil: there is no ruffs at the table, so why return @s?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|daman: @C Q and @D QJ aren't really working cards after the t/o double|pg||
nt|hausigel: funny. I would say, South is on lead against 2@S|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: @dK is better|pg||
nt|odysseus69: strange way to start - maybe only way to try to go down but OK as long as second club now|pg||
nt|sheila a: but will probably be a flat board|pg||
nt|viren169: with 9 or 10 card fit... usually best to bid quickly... as a 2-way shot...|pg||

pc|h2|pc|dA|nt|viren169: Over a weak 2@S... I am in the 4@S camp!|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: as the @s ruff provides the back entry for the @DA and club discard|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: he is ok becos @C lenght is on his left|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: ok back to 18 now :)|pg||
nt|npcjpn: nine tricks for both sides.|pg||
nt|werge: I hope, they play with screens...|pg||
nt|boedhy: yes well done|pg||
nt|petergill: Bye everyone, I have to go.|pg||
nt|bobholl: pity but both wouldn't work|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Declarer misguessed trumps in 4@H|pg||
mb|1H|nt|npcjpn: NS playing weak notrump. but this North hand is too strong for strong notrump.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: screens are up :)|pg||
nt|forni: sound-proof screens? Or did Peake hear Gill screaming?|pg||
mb|d|nt|sunsamvar: there they go again bidding opps suit :)|pg||
nt|werge: Seems to be a weak opening|pg||
nt|forni: very|pg||
nt|forni: but|pg||
nt|forni: as the cards lie... 4@H makes.|pg||
nt|werge: Not on a trump leas - and more of them|pg||
nt|werge: lead|pg||
nt|forni: unless NS decide to lead trump|pg||
nt|forni: hehe|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|swanson: 3NT was anti-field - I believe one should just take their best shot to make the contract in that situation.|pg||
nt|janm: Doesn't seem as if "field" was too likely to be relevant - they were in a fairly anti-field contract, unless weak NT is more common in this field than most?|pg||
nt|mrdct: 9 tricks on top in 3NT|pg||
mb|3D|nt|marlowepi: here most people would bid 2H as S, showing INV + in clubs|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: and 5 more on 17|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are a million things that can go wrong, in the layout or in the defence. after all, if you had clearly misdefended two games already (as W did in the first set), would you be ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so quick to double?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 5 boards to go here|pg||
nt|werge: We are back to 9 tricks each way|pg||
nt|bobholl: will he beleive that a double works now :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: eau de cologne 4711 play in 7 card suit|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mariner1: well in Oz with transfer openers and bids its hard to tell :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously NS have had 2 hands too strong and zero that fit (11)12-14 opener or 15-17 rebid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will they rech the good 6@C here ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Pass first|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: honours lying badly for declarer and that dooms the good 5@C contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: not uncommon|pg||
nt|keylime: South might like her hand a lot now|pg||
nt|npcjpn: very cautios pass by Green.|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Has W run out of Pass cards?|pg||
nt|vlad9:  3he puts pressure on S|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: there are some as far as a can see :)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|nickf: was 1S-1NT-P 2S-2S-3H|pg||
nt|cindy: not that much i guess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this hand shows the power of shape and aces, NS making 6C with only 22 working HCP|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: she passed very quickly|pg||
nt|npcjpn: if West's minor reversed...|pg||
nt|werge: West should be declarer - trump lead is more difficult for Nortth than for Souht|pg||
nt|forni: true|pg||
nt|forni: but they're not in game, so it really doesn't matter anymore. Too bad, could've used some more exitement|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: he has handled it well|pg||
nt|2hplus4: It puts pressure on partner too :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: but mandatory in NZ where I think they come from|pg||
nt|janm: I think we're one player off here - N opened 1@s|pg||
nt|nickf: Ally, undo the auction|pg||
nt|swanson: Aren't we off by 90 degrees in the bidding here?|pg||
nt|werge: I go for coffie here|pg||
mb|5D|nt|sybarra: can they get to 6@D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duck once -- let Horwitz find correct pointed [@S/@D] shift|pg||
nt|allanr44: something stronger  :)|pg||
nt|werge: But only after the lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: just kidding ....:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stripe-tailed ape in passout seat|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely 2 @D was inverted |pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am guessing yes. E will like his aces and W will like his trumps and controls|pg||
nt|sybarra: I.e.  =good hand|pg||
nt|keylime: I think you get there once you hear the spade ace|pg||
nt|sybarra: is that inverted?  I should have looked closer |pg||
nt|werge: Nor 4 @D-.tricks possible|pg||
nt|forni: he'll have to play the @D for 4 tricks to make game|pg||
nt|forni: duck a club now|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: i assumed it was a simple raise|pg||
nt|mrdct: should make 10 tricks now as the @S finesse is safe|pg||
nt|npcjpn: will shift to spades, I guess.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if K is strong lead -- then Gill has a) denied @HJ  and b) shown doubleton |pg||
nt|bobholl: werge coffee is english koffie is dutch don't mix them up :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Oh dear. I hate to see bidding like that rewarded|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: now can duck @D for squeeze that doesn't materialize|pg||
pc|c4|nt|werge: café au lait|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|keylime: declarer will be happy about the 3-0 spade break with the A@c safely tucked away|pg||
nt|keylime: club break I meant|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i don;t think so.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: declarer would probably prefer for 6 not to be cold|pg||
nt|keylime: quite true. |pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: and taaaaaaaaadaaaaaaaaaa|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: whatever the bids meant,  wd to e/w |pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are many players who would upgrade the W hand due to the long suit and open 2NT. this hand is an excellent example of why that is so wrong. 2NT openers are slam-killers. here ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E woiuldn;t dream of slam in a million years over 2NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this hand also shows some of the weakness of the point-count. with only 19 HCP, W actually has a better hand in a sense than a 2NT opener because of the long suit and the controls|pg||
nt|cindy: crashed :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this match might now be about even when these last two are compared|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome back|pg||
nt|cindy: ty|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what woke you?|pg||
nt|vlad9:  I wonder what should S have in N opinion to make a game opposite 3di nonforcing bid by S|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mariner1: good cash for the defense here|pg||
nt|mrdct: might duck a @S now to set up a potential red suit squeeze on west|pg||
nt|allanr44: schnapps?|pg||
nt|bobholl: oops|pg||
pc|s2|nt|werge: Do´nt be surprisde, this will be one down...|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|keylime: declarer will probably play a@h, heart ruff A@d, diamond ruff, heart ruff|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mrdct: @D i mean|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: but i think most would have lead @HQ for unblock or count |pg||
pc|c2|nt|allanr44: oh dear|pg||
nt|bobholl: my oops wasn't in vain :)|pg||
nt|werge: I´am back - with whiskey...!|pg||
nt|werge: Never give up|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mariner1: had to get @D right|pg||
nt|mariner1: has|pg||
pc|d7|nt|janm: So is this round going to be all about diamonds?|pg||

nt|bjacobs: 4333 should not use Stayman|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this might provoke some entertainment|pg||
nt|ralfwil: We din´t see why this ended in -3!|pg||
nt|daman: slam time|pg||
nt|viren169: Now a thin slam hand!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: board 9 is also wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: we will boardcast board 11 and 12|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: and hopefully 10 if it's correct|pg||
nt|xenya: good :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: bd 8 was 2@DX+2|pg||
nt|santyclz: Meanwhile, Vladimir will sing for us.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: not a succesfull defence by EW|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm not sure if i can, Joe...|pg||
nt|hausigel: have him sing "diamonds are forever"|pg||
nt|xenya: anyway you wouldn't be too pleased if i did|pg||
nt|santyclz: Maybe I can get an expert opinion on some of my misbidding yesterday.|pg||
nt|santyclz: x jx kq10xxx aqxx.  Red vs white.  1@c on my right, 1@d by me, 1@s on my left, 2@h by pd, 2@s on my right, ?|pg||
nt|xenya: i would pass|pg||
nt|vbman: dbl maybe?|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe, but i prefer pass|pg||
nt|hausigel: i like dbl - if it shows this hand :)|pg||
nt|hausigel: otherwise 3@C or 3@H... i wouldnt pass|pg||
nt|santyclz: X would have worked out well, pd had a109x aq10xx x xxx.  (I bid 3@hs, and pd quit the game)|pg||
nt|werge: Here I will wait for South handling well the @D-suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: do we open the East hand?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: although as we have seen, East seems a soemwhat cautious bidder|pg||
nt|henryb: another good 3N|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 1@H = 8-11, 5 card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H  8-11|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: looks like EW will settle in 4@S   |pg||
nt|mmmakela: bet overbid to nonmaking 4 @S|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|ady: 2@D  in other room   an opportunity for n/s here    3NT cold on diamond break|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N.  For minors or a wild shot?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Is this minors?|pg||
nt|othered1: I like the 2@H bid, which many today would open 1.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: What the difference between after 3@c bid 3@d and partner is a little bit strongen and has to pass?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thin?  This is a rock.  Well above 12.89%.  Much too good for Roland.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I don't know that I could find the good slam here, beginning with a 3@d overcall.|pg||
nt|viren169: Should reach it now...|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|Walddk4: Bill is too fast, but he is also younger than me|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South contemplating - but I would pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: 5@d cold on @d break and @cA onside|pg||
nt|viren169: Not a bad slam... thin on values...|pg||
nt|hausigel: he wont have any evidence to run the @DJ, i guess|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|bjacobs: This is not dissimilar to facing a weak 2@H opening|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's the same, is it not?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 8 trick with bad defence|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: another chance|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and you would pass a weak 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: true sharp values are needed to advance|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes |pg||
nt|sheila a: that lead takes care of the @s finesse|pg||
nt|santyclz: As for your question about opening the e hand.  Yes, but only in the past 2 years or so.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Do we have the wrong cards again?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: nope|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: NS playing strong @C|pg||
nt|werge: Seems normal - all of it|pg||
nt|hausigel: this seems to be their methods to bid a weak NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|henryb: I think S should bid again on his hand|pg||
nt|othered1: was north transferring or cue-bidding?  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Obvious a wild shot!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 4@d on W has a chance|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @s i mean|pg||
nt|mmmakela: when in w HQ S must switch to low club|pg||
nt|othered1: if west leads parthner's suit, this is down with 6@D making|pg||
nt|viren169: Still a bit of work to do in the bidding... |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: right away|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: And @H shift after winning @SA is good enough, too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: And also after an initial pass?|pg||
nt|joest: its just that your partner has to be a very good guesser if you could have 0-9 for a 3@d call|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bjacobs: There was a defence to beat 2@H I think|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bjacobs: East leads his top club top start with|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now it´s about overtricks!|pg||
nt|joest: I admit sometimesits nice to be able to bid 2NT natural|pg||
nt|joest: on balance the convention has worked forme|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in fact it´s a kind of bidding style and system|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cuttysark: What should he bid?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|roswolf: he still might go off|pg||
nt|joest: they pushed that spade slam on board 7|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|mmmakela: or like this, king bad|pg||
nt|mmmakela: this must show king in cashout situation|pg||
nt|viren169: I wouldnt! but I've seen it is getting more and more popular!|pg||
nt|viren169: West should make one more try with 4@D|pg||
pc|d9|nt|joest: n-s with four more top tricks coming as long as they don't blow their spade trick or end play themselves|pg||
nt|daman: not a well played match at all|pg||
nt|santyclz: Serious 3nt would have worked well here.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: North does have a maximum for the 2@D rebid|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@d, I think|pg||
pc|c9|nt|roswolf: if east had won the diamond|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Why would you lead the doubleton spade, when holding @CAK10x?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: click on UNDO a few times operator|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's on your toolbar|pg||
nt|roswolf: well bridge atheism is one answer|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm not religious in general, but I think I AM religious about leading from AK suits|pg||
nt|viren169: 2N may have been some form of Romex and 3@H a splinter|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sheila a: Surely that was a @h|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
mc|12|nt|hausigel: the @H8 must be a relief to declarer - suggests the @SA is onside|pg||

nt|santyclz: Sigh, more flat hands.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S EW .,,, NS will be in there too|pg||
nt|janm: Diamonds will be easy to guess on this hand, so only 2 of the 3 had interesting diamond positions :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: and has improved her bridge significantly during that period|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: sorry boards put in wrong|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes N should have passed. His double was questionable in the first place|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: a few minutes break is starting now|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: the players will be back in awhile|pg||
nt|vlad9:  kqxxxx  di and 2 aces would be sufficient to make 5 di|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: we are resuming the play|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mrdct: she has won back to back National Open Teams playing with Gill|pg||
nt|npcjpn: her debut was 1976 olympiad in Monaco.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugrapha3: short break|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: we are on again|pg||
nt|werge: When I started playing bridge, South did NOT have an opening hand...|pg||
nt|forni: good ending for EW in open|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Shen rightfully has great confidence in his partners dummy play and is therefore bidding to the hilt|pg||
nt|bobholl: irish coffee tastes good !|pg||
nt|allanr44: no schnapps?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Looks like 3NT EW here|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I'm not sure whether the 1NT is strong, and N upgraded, or weak and N decided it wasn't worth more than 1NT - I'll bet the former, though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm trying to remember -- was Horwitz team winner of recent NOT [where Peter was winning his 3rd straight trophy]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops  -- i was typing while Dave was already answering the question|pg||
nt|mrdct: i don't believe she has ever played in an olympiad|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I haven't seen this treatment before|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - East should be partner with South here|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: they are playing board nine :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|npcjpn: she has played mant times in Olympiad in open category.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and why no 1N opener from North??|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: nobody plays anything natural over a 1@C opening these days|pg||
nt|werge: Can West stay out of game - 14 HCP facing an opening hand...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: weak NT allows the auction to be jacked up quick again|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lovely position for w to be in vul vs not.|pg||
nt|keylime: B6 in the open room now|pg||
mb|d|nt|swanson: I think a trump lead is necessary here to stop game in spades.|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS should score well here|pg||
nt|swanson: BUt, of course, you first have to enter the auction.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H has play, so a make is really big her|pg||
nt|mariner1: here|pg||
nt|keylime: 2@d looks to be the Multi here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my bet -- Fiona misclick    1N-P-2@C puppet to 2@D makes more sense|pg||
nt|mrdct: the 1@C opening might include weak NT hands|pg||
nt|npcjpn: yes, AL, after 1NT opening, thier 2@c is puppet to 2@d.|pg||
nt|allanr44: that was 10 imps I'd imagine|pg||
nt|2hplus4: this could be costly I'd XX as West|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: S trying to win some imps back|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: ok, will see board eight later.|pg||
nt|forni: there we go, more trouble for the Aussies|pg||
nt|bobholl: what could west win with cover ?|pg||
nt|allanr44: you've got me ...|pg||
nt|werge: 10 doubleton by East|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: they have missed 18 :) |pg||
nt|werge: That´s the price for East double|pg||
nt|werge: East´s|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: usually start of a sign-off in a suit.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: one or three club opening?|pg||
nt|werge: This can´t be the bidding - 4 @c from West!?!|pg||
nt|npcjpn: looks normal if the opening bid was 3@c|pg||
nt|werge: Sure|pg||
nt|forni: NS will be able to take the first 6 tricks.|pg||
nt|allanr44: with K75 I have no idea|pg||
nt|werge: But that only would avoid the overtrick|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|swanson: One reason that West could consider 4@S is that partner will have at most a singleton heart on the auction.|pg||
nt|werge: Play low - West will not dare playing the @S King...|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bobholl: a trick missing in all colours |pg||
nt|bobholl: may be @D disappearing on @S|pg||
nt|2hplus4: That'll strike fear into declarer's heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: W was thinking of redoubling but decided it was better not to having in mind the score ;) |pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: maybe 1 nt would have been better? |pg||
nt|sybarra: easy from here |pg||

nt|allanr44: i doubt it|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is another option |pg||

pc|dJ|nt|swanson: Still, there is that dark red on the boards looking at West.|pg||
nt|boedhy: sorry Sunil but I have to leave also have fun|pg||
nt|boedhy: and spectators too offcourse|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: bye Ruud|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: i think i understand the bidding through 1S after that i am lost|pg||
nt|cindy: agree|pg||
nt|keylime: I would have bid 1NT, if not, honor-9 isn't bad for 2@h|pg||
nt|mrdct: this is a pretty handy start to the match for Horwitz|pg||
nt|werge: 130 in silence|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||

nt|sheila a: Looked as if it was making from that point|pg||

nt|santyclz: Rixi Marcus was decades ahead of her time.|pg||
nt|viren169: I have died many times over!|pg||
nt|daman: if you aren't going to bid your hand properly then don't open a flat 11 point hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: board 10 is also incorrect|pg||
nt|santyclz: +140 rather than +300 in 2@sx'd or 600 in 3nt.|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N doesn't look too good on @S lead?|pg||
nt|hausigel: an easy 4@H?|pg||

nt|henryb: One spec points out that partner is often maximum because the opponents have at least 9 spades and have not bid|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mdgraham: if anything, 2NT is an underbid with those spades|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Ahem|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 8-11|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting 1@H opening...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: needs a @d lead to avoid 12 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: 3 @C now|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: west has good diamond stopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Great stuff|pg||
nt|othered1: AS the cards lie, game in @S or NT is on|pg||
nt|viren169: 2!N is probably good raise in @Hs|pg||
nt|werge: Why insists South in NOT finding the best contract?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk4: E-W shut out and 4@S is a make|pg||
nt|bjacobs: you put the fear of god into me Roland ...|pg||
nt|sheila a: I have high hopes for this contract. It might break the run of minus scores|pg||
nt|mmmakela: my personal record is 28 HCP|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|odysseus69: west will be feeling ill by now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if E bid pass, they are lycky to find @hA  doubleton|pg||
nt|othered1: That's a very conservative 2@S, even if it shows very substantial values above a minimum double.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me - 3@s is obvious|pg||
nt|hausigel: he doesnt insist - he is just trying|pg||
nt|werge: That was NOT a try|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Cricket is my religion and Tendulkar is my God. Beat that, Bill|pg||
nt|ralfwil: lucky...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: I can´t see why he opens with 1@c with a longer @c? now there are problems|pg||
nt|odysseus69: will East read that??|pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably not and why bid a weaker @h before a good @d?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: What is 5@d?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 29 actually|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with @dK on side, 12 tricks..|pg||
nt|joest: 3@h is a HUGE underbid|pg||
nt|daman: Fritzi Gordon could hold her own |pg||
nt|viren169: 3@C is interesting!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: 1 spade unlimited?|pg||
nt|henryb: I think I would risk forcing to game with south: 2@c-2@d-2@s|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not many defenders find the double duck of @DA - and here the ten drops, so it is academic|pg||
nt|ralfwil: soon it´t time for X|pg||
nt|joest: to my way of thinking :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: My guess would be minimum, balanced.|pg||
nt|viren169: been told 3@C is min by specs...|pg||
nt|werge: If not 3 @C, then 4 @C...!|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mmmakela: and I had to take an insurance save at 7-level(true story)|pg||
nt|othered1: As east, I would have bid 4@S.  Two kings are enough for game.  But their standards for double followed by new suit may be lower than mine.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I see your point, but with a weaker hand I had bid 1@h, so 2@c shows something|pg||
nt|othered1: If west is thinking of bidding on, it shows the earlier bids were indequate.  Not good to blow hot and cold on a hand.|pg||
nt|joest: let's see if north doesn't waste his three of hearts|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, cricket is a unique game ...|pg||
pc|dT|nt|santyclz: The other possibility is that 2nt was a xfer to @cs.|pg||
nt|daman: posturing before leading the singleton @C|pg||
nt|viren169: N wont believe S has a singleton in @Ds and will switch to @C|pg||
nt|viren169: Not easy for defense...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|odysseus69: good quetion- west knows what it means or what he wants it to mean.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with a correct play 13 teicks!|pg||

nt|marlowepi: the Melbourne team is amassing a big lead, but in baseball parlance they are all "unearned runs", i.,e. unforced errors by the other team. |pg||
nt|cindy: me either|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 12 imps for the slam|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: saving time with the intention of hitting the beach i suppose :)|pg||
nt|npcjpn: last board of the set.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: ten boards more.|pg||
nt|forni: unfortunately, it costs him 8 imps|pg||
nt|westjava: sry,late:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice try but no result|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't think S should have doubled. He knew somebody did not have their bid|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't mind the 1@S opener especially at the score|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Friede from Germany|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello all.|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Hello there|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: hi Friede |pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: I think they may win the event|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: You are just in time cause I have to leave soon :)|pg||
nt|westjava: to leave me alone...?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|forni: Horwitz did very well in the swiss, but this isn't great bridge what they're showing.|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|westjava: btw,what system they are using,Sunil?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3 of my teammates are waiting for me to join them at the bridge club..|pg||
nt|westjava: ok,npp|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: thogh i wud very much like to stay and watch this great match.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Possible @d slam for N/S here.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I would just punt 3NT|pg||
nt|2hplus4: At least he has bid his suit this time. Needs a @C lead to stop slam I think|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sunsamvar: i must say Fiona that I had a roaring time in the Gold Coast a few years ago.|pg||
nt|werge: Is 4 @S better than 4 @H here - I thionk so|pg||
nt|werge: think|pg||
nt|bobholl: precision has difficulties with 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: much need 12 imps |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: its my favourite tourney of the year :) so much fun|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Not that they are likely to bid it|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: in the other match  Cayne leads 22-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW need to be careful here..... can get too high|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Sorry everyone. Power issues with the laptop :(|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: by the way the Indian selection trials also witnessed high drama |pg||
nt|westjava: 1@C alerting for precision?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the match finished even after a 80 board final|pg||
mb|3C|nt|santyclz: 1nt everybody's rebid?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @S=transfer to 1 nt |pg||
nt|sybarra: (my guess)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the sun, the san, the adventures at seaworld, the night life.. had a ball|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: oh i was on holiday and not playing bridge :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: it is getting a lot of international interest especially with the Yeh Brothers being held here this year|pg||
mb|p!|nt|cindy: what now ?|pg||
nt|keylime: 3@s is a misstatement of the hand|pg||
nt|cindy: N put S on the spot|pg||
nt|keylime: 3@d as well|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D or 3H, depending on agreements|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|npcjpn: in the open room, after declarer found trumps break, he took a safety play in diamonds, cashing ace first.|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: many thanks to our great operator.|pg||
nt|westjava: nice math|pg||
nt|bobholl: will N bid 3 ! S ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not sure why Valkanov hasn't bid 3NT long time ago|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He is way behind, and all he needs is an ace and @DK onside|pg||
mb|4D|nt|cindy: N should just bid 3N|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 2 boards to go after this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have power issues too - but more organic|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and in the 4 board playoff Formidables beat Texans|pg||
nt|westjava: wow!|pg||
nt|werge: @D 9 is my lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: yes E/W play precision Liliek|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: now I would not find 1N here|pg||
nt|swanson: E-W should find 4@H and make on a crossruff.  Declarer will need to ruff the third club high to avoid an overruff.|pg||
nt|mariner1: no|pg||
nt|keylime: with 4333 I am heading straight to 3NT once 2@h hits the table as a choice of game|pg||
nt|npcjpn: no double by South?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Gábor Szöts from Hungary|pg||
nt|bobholl: yuo can't cope with @H 41 so forget about that :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Even @c lead won't set slam; declarer can finesse in @s, cash king and get back to Ace@s with @d. he just must not pull all trumps first|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I think it depends whether EW are playing weak or strong NT. If weak, this is reasonable - treating the hand as a strong NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: That should solve the ruff problem.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: and South really passed?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: bidding not acurate. I missed the auction sorry|pg||
nt|forni: ...|pg||
nt|forni: I'm not sure what I want to say|pg||
nt|cicus: hi all|pg||
nt|bobholl: he did and obviously forcing why otherwise a slam try from S|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would lie an ace in N :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: It looks to me NS pair is in some kind of a knock-down|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How do you get back to dummy, Friede?|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: they had some quarrels about previous boards|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: i bet not actual auction - Fiona entered just to catch up|pg||
nt|npcjpn: and many thanks to organizer and kibitzers.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Gabor|pg||
nt|baldfriede: cassh A@d and then lead low @d to dummy|pg||
nt|2hplus4: How does he get to dummy for @S finesse?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But you have not taken the finesse yet|pg||
pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: well, i don;t think it is clear at all. the right contract could easily be 5D, 6D, 3NT, 4S, etc.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for me, 3C is clear|pg||
nt|keylime: I liked the double for that reason Marshall - to cater to the maximum number of hand types|pg||
nt|cindy: i dont like 3C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but S cannot bid 4H|pg||
nt|cindy: N is the one with the Q of clubs and 4333 shape opposite a minimum hand|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: same principle for 3C. the golden rule of constructive bidding is that the 3 level is for game exploration. so whenever strain is in doubt, that is what the 3 level is for. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: choosing not to use it means you are pretty sure you know the right contract. i would not be at all sure of that holding the N cards|pg||
nt|forni: either: well done by NS, good stop in 3@D|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Gabor,wlc:)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|bobholl: on @D k lead 6@S migth make :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|cicus: hi Sunil, Liliek|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: So now i leave the table in very capable hands.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|forni: or... Gill, why on earth wouldn't you bid 3@S?|pg||
nt|bobholl: NS obviously don't agree on the strength of this sequence|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mrdct: horwitz will be delighted with a 33-1 start given that they can now play their all-pro line-up for the rest of the match|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|cindy: N has notrump cards  queens and jacks|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: might wish he had played another @H?|pg||
nt|bobholl: oops made :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sunsamvar: bye all and thanks|pg||
nt|westjava: ok Sunil ty n cu next|pg||
nt|cicus: bye|pg||
nt|cicus: this is going several down|pg||
nt|2hplus4: North seemingly could noit catch up after 2@D|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: thanks to our operator Fiona Brown - especially with the laptop problems|pg||
nt|cicus: I think E might have tried to play in a suit by bidding 3@C|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
mc|11|nt|mariner1: this is a hand where its very important to count your tricks to make sure you end up|pg||
nt|mariner1: with enough.... and more than once|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Bad luck Sheila!!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: down 7, tough luck pal|pg||
nt|othered1: Another huge balanced hand, and in the other room got to game wihtout mentioning 10-card @S fit.|pg||
nt|daman: 2 more boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: Now we are back!|pg||
nt|xenya: needs some luck, no?|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm not sure I understand the term "wet", but think that was it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Now for an unfortunate 4@H N/S way...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Loses 2@ss 1@h and 1@d.  2@s 4@h 1@d 2@c.|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ralfwil: terrible! N must see that a @s switch is needed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Did 1NT not go 1 down on board 7?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I was pretty sure it was going several down, but didn't like to contradict you Sheila|pg||
nt|sheila a: Noooo!!!|pg||
nt|joest: this is a superb 6@c contract and a chance for Curt-Lennart to pull much closer|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|Walddk4: Looking at the play it did|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think so|pg||
nt|daman: should only be down 1    -2 in the OR|pg||
mb|d|nt|bjacobs: We commentators must back each other up, even when we make bad predictions|pg||
nt|roswolf: now how to bid to slam now?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Why bother? Anything above the 1 level is doomed|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@C is a possibility a spec suggests - i like that if not convenional|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Do you all play 2NT as full value in the balancing seat? I play it a little weaker, 18-20|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm a 19-21 sort of guy|pg||
nt|sheila a: Me too, Bill|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Double and rebid NT = 16-18|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Direct 1NT = 11-15 or so|pg||
mb|2D|nt|joest: I've given up on figuring out the 1NT rebid ranges :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: ugly t/o dbl imo|pg||
nt|werge: Next board (number 28...)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Operator, you can correct that. Click on MOVIE, highlight board 7 and overwrite:  1NE-1|pg||
nt|mmmakela: wouldn't even consider it|pg||
nt|othered1: North has quite a good hand over a powerhouse opening.  That could affect the decision to bid or not, as partner and east are marked with very little.|pg||
nt|joest: uh oh|pg||
nt|joest: they can't even make this|pg||
nt|viren169: Defense need to be tidy....|pg||
nt|santyclz: It also seems that 4@h was played by e in the open room which seems rather unlikely.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i am with you bill|pg||
nt|joest: can they get back to clubs?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: west will discard a diamond     now you have to give up a spade to wesst and hope he has no more diamonds  or try the hearts which fails|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I cannot agree with 3@c. 2@h is expensive doubled!|pg||
nt|sheila a: That was tricky for W, but the aces might have persuaded him to have a try|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, Roland, you probably have a bit more clarity with your 1NT balance ...|pg||
nt|joest: oh 4NT was Blackwood!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my system this is quanitative|pg||
nt|santyclz: Back to the match.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: would you all bid 4NT?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|othered1: ;Here west had a forcing 2@S available, a normal choice, with NT in reserve, if needed.  East's jump to game is very normal|pg||
nt|hausigel: unfortunate. 4@H goes down with @S ruff|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, you are lucky enough to get 4 @H tricks |pg||
pc|cA|nt|henryb: I had forgotten that the @hA went at trick 1|pg||
nt|othered1: Unluckily, west may be down as many as 2|pg||
nt|santyclz: So the scores may be off even more than we thought.|pg||
nt|viren169: I guess this seq shows a longer suit than bidding 1@H over 1@D...|pg||
nt|hausigel: lead, trump, another lead, claim|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|roswolf: this contract is not a lock|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Indeed, there is a very nice play to make it, and perhaps the auction makes it a reasonable shot|pg||
nt|sheila a: S promises 8 HCP|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It is to cash your red winners, and throw South in with the 4th spade|pg||
nt|sheila a: If S is 5-4-3-1, though, that might be wrong?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but it is my experience that declarers dont use the gratuitous info given by forcing pass systems in the play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Break for lunch after this set. Restart at 13.20 local time, in 1 hour and 15 minutes|pg||
pc|dA|nt|joest: double is poor.  West will be on lead vs either clubs or NT.  Why give the hand away?|pg||
nt|hausigel: I would pass|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ralfwil: 3nt in OR was a hit|pg||
nt|joest: this will take a while to play :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: 7@h in OR!|pg||
nt|othered1: You'll see this one in bidding contests in a couple of years.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think players have forgotten penalty doubles (optional and converting to penalty)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ralfwil: only a @d ruff on the table|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mmmakela: hope not on this board|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the third @d can be discarded on the foutrh @s|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hausigel: ok, you got me. @SJ is better|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hausigel: but some play dbl over 4-level opening as strict takeout, some as optional (may pass with balanced hand)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: duplicated shapes are particularly unlucky here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: When N interfered with 2@d W has a NT-hand|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ralfwil: with a neutral defence, this will go down.|pg||
nt|hausigel: I prefer the second way. but if their dbl is strictly for takeout, 4NT stands out|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Wwhen declarer cannot see that @hJ is second|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|sybarra: you are peaking dwayne|pg||

nt|bobholl: it is not easy to coorporatye now with the 4 small @S|pg||
nt|bobholl: and KQ of @C|pg||
nt|2hplus4: could S not double for black suits?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N has play issues so 4 of a major seems best|pg||

mb|d!|mb|3D|nt|vugrapha3: she passed|pg||
mb|4C|nt|marlowepi: yes, N didnt bid 2D, so 3C ought to be INV|pg||
nt|westjava: under bid..??|pg||
nt|werge: Double for the @S-lead would have worked fine here|pg||
nt|werge: The wrong Jack was lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: now he has to get a trick from the @Ds|pg||
nt|allanr44: win Q and small spade is probably best|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cindy: everyone agree with 2H ?|pg||
nt|keylime: the 9@d led against the 3NT in the other room which hit paydirt|pg||
nt|werge: South must put his money on the @D 10|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Questions, questions...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It might be wrong, so as you are cashing your red winners you look at North's cards closely - he may give honest count|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, final board of the set, and I'd like to thank our nameless operator.  We enjoyed the session, and the boards were interesting|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes good tip bill|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We have no clue as to the scoreline in this match I am sorry to say|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not possible?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't think so|pg||
nt|mmmakela: last one ty all, see ya later!|pg||
nt|othered1: I like the 2@S, forcing, bid.  Partner needs a specific hand to get you beyond 3N at your next turn and often will be right.|pg||
nt|joest: Curt-Lennart within range of pullingthis out if the last board is a swing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like an easy 4@h|pg||

nt|viren169: Thks George and Joe....|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|nt|bjacobs: Yes, and thanks to Sheila, Roland and Geoffrey for the commentary|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North must have opened something|pg||
nt|roswolf: so another go!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Undo twice, operator|pg||
nt|sheila a: N should open 1@c on this, if I remember|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think North opens 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Finally, our appreciation to Filbyter Bridge Club and Carl Ragnarsson for putting on this broadcast|pg||
nt|roswolf: an unusal passout|pg||
nt|sheila a: ok, that was short and sweet|pg||
nt|sheila a: Bye all|pg||
nt|sheila a: both wrong :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Is this an upgraded 14, or are they playing 14-16?|pg||
nt|henryb: I am with him. that is a 15-17 1NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Gaarh!  We was both wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh, he went for an off-shape 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|daman: NS can make 3NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Gad, George and Roland.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: :) i like predictions|pg||
nt|santyclz: I assume Jan in on a plane over there.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|joest: I might upgrade to 3@h here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree 3@h!|pg||
nt|joest: four trumps; max; ace of diamonds conveniently marked to be at my right|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cuttysark: I would prefer better club quality|pg||
nt|othered1: some might rebid 1N onwest's hand, to try to slow things down.  East now has an interesting call, with nothing perfect (4@D maybe?)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: got to a nice spot|pg||
nt|henryb: you are greedy|pg||
nt|roswolf: east was wet here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I was wronger.  Definitely not 1@D (8-11) - Sheila was unlucky|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Anyway, thanks guys and gal for the nice company|pg||
nt|joest: n-s cannot afford to miss this game andhave any hope of surviving the match|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|roswolf: he was worth a raise to 3 surely|pg||
nt|Walddk4: See you later|pg||
nt|sheila a: Let me make another prediction - W will get @s wrong|pg||
nt|xenya: surely wrong score on 23|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: good (normal) lead|pg||
pc|s5|nt|othered1: now east has to bid the hand out with 4@D, no, as west isn't all that limited?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|othered1: It would have been different had west rebid 1N|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|viren169: Interesting choice of lines here... |pg||
nt|santyclz: The open room had 4@h being played by e!|pg||
nt|xenya: which is nonsense?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Obviously.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|othered1: When west opened this, he probably didn't expect to be playing 5@D, or more as partner thinks . . . |pg||
nt|othered1: He does have good side controls, but that's about it.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: and go 6 down?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well done Sheila!  She got one right|pg||
nt|sheila a: possibly|pg||
nt|ralfwil: thx all See you in 30 minutes|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|sheila a: It was worth the wait|pg||
nt|othered1: In the other room the 2@H opening probably limited the hand enough for east to bail out.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: It´s safe to win with @sA. E cannot have an 8-card @d|pg||
pc|s6|nt|othered1: East's auction isn't very disciplined, since he produced a strong auction to 4@D and partner never took a forward-going bid.|pg||
nt|xenya: so should be 8 imps to NS|pg||
pc|s8|nt|xenya: probably 9 tricks here?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|odysseus69: 4H showed heart and club control - for sure|pg||
nt|viren169: East will hastily switch to a @C now |pg||
nt|daman: trop tard|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|ralfwil: W is marked with the reat of honours, so there is no danger to play @h now|pg||

nt|keylime: Ohno will be pretty happy after the stumble early on to be in this position|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for all W knew, S might have AKQx of spades and be planning to throw dummy's Ds on spades, but led stiff heart jack as a no-cost extra chance play|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: last board of the match|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|cindy: ohno gonna win|pg||
nt|sybarra: ths also to Dwayne, Cindy and Marshall |pg||
nt|marlowepi: the technical bid on the hand is 1NT, but see my profile.  24 came just in time|pg||
nt|cicus: it will be hard to stop east below 6@D|pg||
nt|westjava: even they play precision|pg||
nt|baldfriede: East's pass is a bit too passive for my taste|pg||
mb|3D|nt|keylime: 1@d = 0-6 or natural or relay|pg||
nt|keylime: 1@c = 2+@c|pg||
nt|cindy: the next set is supposed to start in 5 minutes   not sure that will start on time|pg||
nt|keylime: and that's all she wrote folks|pg||
nt|werge: To get it much more exciting, we need a TD-ruling for ½ IMP|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: yes, borderline, I'd have passed but opened if my @SJ were in @Ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|allanr44: lol|pg||
nt|bobholl: my chinese is very bad does anybody know wheather this is the deciding match ? |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Perhaps 2@C shows majors and he is stuck|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: yes few would|pg||
nt|westjava: pd opening and you have 18 hcp...|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: i think the other room is behind us so assuredly not|pg||
nt|bobholl: vulnerable no future for NS|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Good lead. Let declarer struggle to find his tricks. Should do it here though|pg||

pc|hK|nt|sybarra: and of course,  thx to our specs the best audience in the world!|pg||
nt|sybarra: we appreciate your comments|pg||
nt|werge: If this is deciding, I would lead the @C 9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: N risks jacking them up one and it works|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6 @H 2@S 2aces !NEXT|pg||
nt|allanr44: not a lot of entries to develop tricks|pg||
nt|werge: This lead killed the overtrick|pg||
nt|allanr44: yes|pg||
nt|werge: The @C-ruff went away|pg||
pc|d7|nt|swanson: I would double 3@H with the South hand - this can't be playing well for delcarer.|pg||
nt|mariner1: now they are likely off in 3@H|pg||
nt|cicus: E could diagnose duplication of values in time|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mariner1: win @SA and cash Q and a @D works here|pg||
nt|swanson: It is matchpoints - IMP double would be quite wrong.|pg||
nt|allanr44: and no short diamond honour on side|pg||
nt|baldfriede: can make 11 tricks if ruffing the @h and discarding an @s if North does not overtake K@h|pg||
nt|baldfriede: no, 10 only|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|mariner1: IMPS across the field I think|pg||

nt|hausigel: at last|pg||
nt|hausigel: a cold grand....|pg||
nt|hausigel: if hearts were 2-2 or 3-1.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Too late, we've lost Hans.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Another suit from W should ask for support or be a negative invite depending on your conventions|pg||
nt|henryb: I find it one of the most memorable|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|hausigel: but they might stop in 6@H with only 27 combined HCP|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|henryb: and I do not like 2N because I see no reason to play 3S down 1 when I could have played 2@s making|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hausigel: EW bidding based on vulnerability...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Or invulnerability as the case may be.|pg||
nt|hausigel: 5@H from North seems very pessimistic to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|hausigel: KQxx trump support and a void in opponents suit - what does he need more?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Surely worth a 5@c bid.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|hausigel: I can imagine South will take a deep breath (of relief) when trumps dont break|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|s3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|ralfwil: and you beleive, that you will be allowed to play 2@s?|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|henryb: yes. the auction after all has gone P-P-1S-P-2C-P-2S; I simply said I am uninterested in game opposite a limit raise|pg||

nt|allanr44: well, the 3NT on Bd 13 was the match ...|pg||
nt|allanr44: maybe ...|pg||
nt|werge: Then a board, where bad bidding might pay well 6 @S|pg||
nt|2hplus4: In fact declarer's @S were so good it did not matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: NS have 4 @S IF they get there|pg||
nt|mariner1: W has two choice,,,, bid 3@D or indicate it  OR pass and hope they play in NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|cicus: I'd have upgraded this to 1@C but their NT range may be 16-18|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: on deal 10 NS stopped in 2 @S in the other room (the one 6 was made on @D K lead)|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: In the other semi-final Quantum has won against South Zone. In the last segment the result was 24:24 imps.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cicus: of course with this N hand it does not matter|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|allanr44: This won't be a pickup for Good Ball ...|pg||
mb|3D|nt|cicus: E came to the rescue|pg||
nt|cicus: 1NT would not have played well|pg||
nt|bobholl: now making 6 fairly easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: back|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: So most likely tomorrow the final is going to be Quantum against Primabridge. 1st segment starts at 8:30 CET.|pg||
nt|2hplus4: That's high enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: :)|pg||
nt|allanr44: very easily with short clubs in north.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: now double to show both majors or 1@H (my preference)|pg||
nt|2hplus4: What extras does N think he has?|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: he is wondering where to earn 70 imps from :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cicus: a club lead would have been much better but how was N to know?|pg||
nt|westjava: he is not a magician:)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|mariner1: well EW help them into game|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|mariner1: can he play @S right now?|pg||
nt|ctcbaadmin: EW play Precision.  2D is GF stayman, 2S relays, 3H showed exactly 4-1-4-4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|bobholl: 1 down is good bridge (he will finesse @S)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mariner1: kibbers suggesting 5@D save, however EW have defense too|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|santyclz: Well the defense has managed to break all 3 side suits.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ctcbaadmin: north needs to have KJ9x in hearts to beat this|pg||
nt|ctcbaadmin: declarer will surely guess the club position when he knew that north bhas led from Qx of spades|pg||
nt|ctcbaadmin: on a H return, declarer can establish a H trick to avoid the club guess|pg||
nt|bobholl: now he will also make 6|pg||
pc|d9|nt|cicus: the club goes away but S scores a trump in exchange|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|allanr44: perhaps not, but of no consequence|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|bobholl: he surely trumped :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: see what i meant|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|allanr44: of course|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mariner1: yes and that helps declarer|pg||
nt|allanr44: and the last one ...|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 imp :)|pg||

nt|mariner1: forced him into the right play, could have done it anyway though|pg||
mc|10|nt|mariner1: sometimes aggression backfires....... there in lies the rub|pg||
nt|santyclz: I might have gone down on that defense.  E was making a point of showing a kq.  Why unless he had @sqx?|pg||
nt|santyclz: (ace kq)|pg||

nt|ady: light blues  back in the lead    overboard in other room|pg||
nt|hausigel: in the OR, NS also stopped in 6@H but made the slam. 17 IMPs|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2 more segments after this one?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: this is the last one|pg||
mb|1H|nt|henryb: so we have the majority of the points, probably, and not wild distribution|pg||
nt|hausigel: nice double fit. 4@H= from EW, 4@S= from NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ady: even with stiff k@D   only partial in spades|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: all games should go down|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|hausigel: he better starts taking his tricks, otherwise 4@SX+2|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|henryb: there must be some strange reason why East is tempted to raise to 3@s|pg||
nt|ady: same in the other room     |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|santyclz: I thought there were two more on the 30th.|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|cuttysark: 4-card support - personally I blame the jump to 2@S with a 4-card suit|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|werge: So Yeh Brothers will be the winner - or shall the last two boards decide?|pg||
nt|werge: Another sporty 6 @S|pg||
nt|allanr44: 1 board I think|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't see a normal way to 12 tricks ew|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ctcbaadmin: same thing could happen here if East also opens 1H|pg||
nt|westjava: and when the next scedule?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW can make 3N here and 4@H|pg||
nt|ctcbaadmin: 2S seems to be a minor suit preemptive|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I don't know|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|nt|2hplus4: fortunately dummy has a little help in @S|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|westjava: maybe operator can help us|pg||
nt|cicus: seems like NS can make 6@S here even on a @D lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: N should not "SAVE" after 4@H|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|cicus: by a double squeeze, but may take the club finesse instead|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bobholl: bad luck for ew|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bobholl: although 4@H is already too high with @H 32|pg||
nt|bobholl: with 2 @C 1 @S and 1@H to loose|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Wondering whether to switch to @D now|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|mariner1: 4@S is a nice save|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|westjava: squeez in @H and @C|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't see the harm in a @D to the A and a @D towards the queen|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bobholl: oops :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ctcbaadmin: south shud follow D9 so that East's D5 maybe from 542|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mariner1: oops|pg||
