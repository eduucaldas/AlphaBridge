nt|oosmanb: or a -90 imps dbl?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|farrukh: good dbl for 2 imps minimum|pg||
pc|c6|nt|oosmanb: well @S lead is the only double dummy lead on which you can not make|pg||
nt|oosmanb: according to GIB|pg||
nt|lestergold: the double is the sort of bid which normally attracts a redouble and make|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: luckily for north no one can redouble and few would make either|pg||
nt|werge: @D to the 10 = 12 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: Squeeze they call it|pg||
nt|lestergold: but with north showing spade length why should east play north for dim length too?|pg||
nt|werge: Almost...|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|granguru: N should have played @DA|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s3|pg||

nt|oosmanb: @S and @D is best shot i think|pg||
nt|granguru: the known card|pg||
nt|ketoprak: agree|pg||
pc|dT|nt|henryb: In any case, it stole the pot and got E-W to their best contract|pg||

nt|mariner1: 7@C or 7N|pg||
mb|2N|nt|othered1: north could get in the way -- more over 2@C than 2N|pg||
nt|mariner1: E should have no issues bidding this|pg||
nt|mariner1: E knows they have at least and 11 card fit|pg||

mb|3S|mb|6C|nt|othered1: Admitted, north won't do that, as he might over 2@C|pg||

nt|mariner1: @SA|pg||
nt|mariner1: the point is you want to try for 7, 6@C implies some gamble...... there is not|pg||
nt|mariner1: one........|pg||
nt|othered1: Some people might find west's opening 2N to be too sound.  8 controls, no jacks, no unsupported Q|pg||
