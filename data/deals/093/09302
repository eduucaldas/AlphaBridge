mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: welcome to first of 2 rounds of semi-finals|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: hi all :)|pg||
nt|werge: 3 @S = partner bid 3 NT, if you have a @s-stopper|pg||
nt|werge: But the defence has 5 redtricks|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|sybarra: hi Cindy :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi cindy, shirley, and specs|pg||
nt|cindy: hi marshall :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Marshall |pg||
nt|werge: red tricks|pg||
nt|werge: - and 4 @S is a winner - a lucky one|pg||
pc|dT|nt|swanson: Is there a web site for this event (Gold Coast of Australia)?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Horwitz is here by virtue of winning the Swiss Qualifying|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|janm: I don't know, I'm afraid.|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.qldbridge.com/gcc/           tournament site|pg||
nt|janm: I think this is matchpoints, and we'll be watching 3 boards at a time, right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that look like a 4H call to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ohno had to win a 24 board match to get back into the run for the gold|pg||
nt|npcjpn: sorry, private.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 4NT is a good save.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cindy: agree|pg||
nt|sybarra: prefer 4 ht, but all will be well here also |pg||
nt|werge: Yes - undobled, 5 @C is the right contract, if doubleb'|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Yamada showed his hand and claimed nine :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mariner1: this is an absolutely gorgeous site..... Roland should have sent us!|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Right.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.  Welcome from the beautiful Poconos where it's -10c and snowing hard.|pg||
nt|swanson: N-S could afford to bid spades up to the 3-level, but they haven't found a way to enter the auction.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Welcome to the GC, 26c and we're all indoors playing bridge . :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.qldbridge.com/gcc/results.php  - results|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|janm: 2@d had a very wide range here and East, with nice shape and a little extra in terms of values invited something higher - I think they'd better stop here though|pg||
nt|cindy: this will work out ok but i would bid 4H|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mariner1: hi Ally!|pg||
nt|forni: and we're back at Ohno vs Horwitz, which became an exciting match after two swings in favour of Ohno.|pg||
nt|forni: welcome back, all 23 of you!|pg||
nt|forni: :P|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s6|pc|d8|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|cindy: we knew that :)|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: she is considering :)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|forni: too bad|pg||

nt|sybarra: not letting you up Mashall!|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h4|pc|cJ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h9|nt|janm: With the diamond misguess (a natural one of course), EW will probably be held to 9 tricks here. But that'll be a reasonable matchpoint score I think|pg||

mb|p|nt|panja: Precision 1@C.....4@S seems like a reasonable contract, but with 4-1 break, Declarer might get forced..|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Hi Sisi :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: no prob 3N  here for NS|pg||
nt|fifee: hello Sylvia and David|pg||
nt|fifee: silvia :)|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Jeff Olson|pg||
nt|panja: second hand low..he would have got an extra entry..to ruff out Hearts |pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|c5|nt|olson: he can now make this |pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|garnetts: Oddly 4NT is the worst action because it gives up on the possibility that 4@S was going off--that is double might work better--but of course pass is best|pg||
nt|fifee: comes close to making so actually a good sac|pg||
nt|fifee: if 4@S were making that is|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||

nt|swanson: Not a good effort by N-S.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peter Gill taking no chances with the @S finesse -- 5@C making 5 is nice score|pg||
nt|werge: In my world, North has two 5-cards suits...|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|mariner1: this is Open Pairs so we will not have scores shown......|pg||
nt|swanson: E-W will likely be off one in 2@S here.  Dangerour for SOuth to enter vulnerable with weak minor suits.|pg||
nt|mariner1: weak NT by E|pg||
nt|forni: really?|pg||
nt|forni: if North had 5-5, in my world he would've started off with 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Yamada-Ohno have been playing together for 30+ years. In Beijing their team won the Senior Event|pg||
mb|p|nt|forni: so 6-5 is probable|pg||
mb|d|nt|janm: West will probably transfer to spades... wrong again!|pg||
mb|3D|nt|cindy: hi all    little bit of a late start|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: with the void and the heart fit, i don;t think i could bid less than 3S with the W hand|pg||
nt|npcjpn: no hope for tenth:)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mariner1: the distribution here helps the effort in 3@C|pg||
nt|werge: I meant, I will show the hand as 5-5!|pg||
mb|d|nt|forni: ahh|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: @SA on side, @c 3 3 , @D 3 3 with Q@D in pocket|pg||
nt|swanson: I would have preferred to pass with the South hand with the plan of making a takeout double of hearts if E-W try to play at the two level.|pg||
nt|mariner1: the @H lead works for defense for taps|pg||
nt|janm: 2NT seems a pretty big position to take certainly|pg||
nt|mariner1:  http://www.qldbridge.com/gcc/           tournament site  -|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or else 2NT, followed by 3S (depending on agreements)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play a Weak NT and an uncommon 2@D opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we should be able to follow most of the other auctions|pg||
mb|5C|nt|cindy: N has the hand I like ot be able to bid a nonforcing 2H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after the jump to 4S, Pass by E would surely be forcing, so W should really pass here|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Bakkeren asking about the 2NT bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like lebbish|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Bakkeren in the tank|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so that is what it is|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: in the tank.....|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Bakkeren ...thinking|pg||
nt|sybarra: challenging hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: just in case S has some 6/4 red suited hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be in the tank also |pg||
nt|marlowepi: if W was asking about the 2NT bid, i would guess he was just stalling for time. it is pretty obvious what kind of hand N has|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: they play 2@c as a puppet to 2@d, usually a start of a sign-off, hence 2@d is Stayman.|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: who is a 5 @S bidder? |pg||
pc|d9|nt|janm: How greedy should N be?|pg||
nt|santyclz: An inspired or foolish bid, depending on the result.|pg||
nt|mariner1: agreed, the VUL position vs NV might indicate prudence here|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|swanson: The cards are lying quite well for N-S and declarer is forced to take advantage of it.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pass by E would have been forcing|pg||
nt|forni: well I have to agree with you on that one :)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, i like playing that NF, but i would still pass 2D|pg||
nt|cindy: sometimes partner has the perfect hand where we can make 4H|pg||
nt|keylime: evening everyone|pg||
nt|cindy: hi|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello Cindy, Marshall and Dwayne|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with only 3HCP in my 2 suits and no spade spots, i would not be eager to advance the bidding. i doubt we are missing a game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi roland|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|sunsamvar: Hi and welcome to the 2nd segment of the seminfinal form the Gold Coast|pg||
pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: and cindy and dwayne & specs|pg||
nt|cindy: not me either|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|npcjpn: east is hoping partner has four hearts, but.....|pg||
pc|c2|nt|swanson: Well, maybe not.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|keylime: W-E if memory serves are playing Dutch Doubleton|pg||
nt|cindy: its rare but there are times when partner has nothing but the A in diamonds and its perfect|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we know that @C are 3-2 and @DK is onside, but Ohno will try not to rely upon the finesse|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: wonder what 3 sp would have been instead of 2?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c4|nt|keylime: while N-S are using a weak NT, but unconfirmed about whether it's a strong club system or not|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but i would bid 5S on a different hand, with different bidding|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what isn;t rare is for partner to have 2263, with 2D our last makeable spot|pg||
nt|cindy: thats true|pg||
nt|keylime: especially with the lack of 1NT rebid as well|pg||
nt|cindy: but would you give up a chance for plus 620 when you might go down 100 ?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: after using up dummy's entries though -- he may have no other choices thought|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe @D discard, @H then endplay West?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: oops   Ohno is female -- SHE may look for other options|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|keylime: I would. Partner never has what I need for game. :-)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so much for alternatives :(|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: depends on what i thought the odds were on us having a game. i rate them slightly under googolpex to one/ if pd has 64 reds, most of my hand is wasted|pg||
nt|cindy: you poor thing :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|keylime: I would only consider a try, if South's hand was really prime, i.e. a lot of A's and K's|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mariner1: not hooking the @D really costs here|pg||

mb|2H!|an|weak, 5+!H and 4+!C/!D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: looks like another easy 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Hard hand for east here--would love to pre-empt--but surely the wrong shape unless it shows hearts and a minor|pg||
mb|d|mb|4D|nt|mmmakela: welcome all! hope the technical probs have been sorted out|pg||
nt|panja: it seems they do...|pg||
nt|fifee: muideburg style hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|olson: yes|pg||

nt|vugraphzkv: 6NT for NS|pg||
nt|garnetts: lead singleton|pg||
nt|fifee: 6nt wont make|pg||
nt|garnetts: agreed unless west covers the Q@C |pg||
nt|fifee: unless East does not lead a @H|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: probably make ten tricks for another flattie|pg||
nt|fifee: right David|pg||
mb|d|nt|garnetts: this is not a good bid by west surely|pg||
nt|fifee: Popov frustrated with all his values|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkv: yes, they do.|pg||
nt|panja: this will be an interesting 3Nt|pg||
nt|olson: S will be endplayed at trick 1  into giving up a trick  |pg||
nt|panja: South must avoid a Club lead..|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: Andonov is thinking|pg||
nt|garnetts: East must be something like he is with longer diamonds so this makes no sense--if east is forced it will hurt|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mmmakela: Bulgarian CS's semi, 2x20 boards|pg||
nt|wwalter: this could be expensive :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|olson: the best lead  is spade J  but this is impossible  |pg||
mb|p|nt|fifee: 6@C is on |pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure I would move as South---partner is almost marked with four hearts--otherwise west would have raised over 2@H |pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Friederike from Germany|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello all.|pg||
nt|lestergold: if not bothering with dim finesse make more maybe|pg||

nt|garnetts: I also agree that 6@C will make --should make even --maybe North should bid it|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hK|nt|panja: well, @S8 or 6 will work fine|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|panja: ideally, the 6/5 rather|pg||

nt|mariner1: off 1 might score some,,, not easy to see|pg||
nt|mariner1: very true John..........|pg||
nt|swanson: Two 10% results for N-S in my judgment.|pg||
nt|mariner1: when is an aggressive contract its usually best to try to make it.......|pg||
nt|nickf: Hi - we'll see North's daughter later on I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: when in|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, shirley, i was wondering too, since 2S seems like such an underbid|pg||
nt|sybarra: it didnt show the shape imo |pg||
nt|sybarra: but oh well,  |pg||
nt|sybarra: someone brought out the goulash dealer?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: checking conditions -- the semi-final will be 4-10 board segments|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@H here for E/W|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|werge: Another 5-6|pg||
nt|forni: yeap|pg||
nt|forni: and it'll become interesting what one would bid with S after 1@C|pg||
nt|forni: I'm very fond of bidding known 2-suiters|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: a spec suggested that W might have deliberately underbid, walking the dog. but S had shown his hand and N was marked with only a few points. so it easily could have gone all pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|werge: Here, North is the best to be declarer in 3 NT|pg||
nt|forni: so if I could bid 2@C or 3@C or 2NT or 3@D as @S+@D, I would surely do so.|pg||
nt|forni: But|pg||
nt|forni: I don't realise... my 1@C is forcing, and it's actually kinda normal that E would open a strong 2@C :P|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: p p p|pg||
nt|forni: now E has an interesting problem|pg||
mb|2H|nt|keylime: N-S may get a little nudge here into game|pg||
nt|cindy: yes|pg||
nt|cindy: N wouldnt pass 3C anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: Fiona Brown, who came 4th in World Mixed Pairs a few years ago when just 22|pg||
nt|forni: yes blackwould would surely do, I always think too difficult|pg||
nt|forni: :S|pg||
mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: i would be very nervous of cidding just 3C with the S hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my methods, pass is strong inaction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now THAT is surprising -- I thought Yamada would double again|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: THree boards per round I believe, then we get new players (at least different players).|pg||
nt|cindy: i bet he was starting to sweat a little|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: Fiona was also an excellent Vugraph Operator during the Yeh Cup!|pg||
pc|dK|nt|swanson: This delayed raise by East generally is used to show a solid values for 2@H.|pg||
nt|keylime: 3@c seens a little conservative to me as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: letting the opponents play 2-level in 8 card fit tends to lose more than it gains|pg||
pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: i suspect he was trying to walk the dog|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cindy: would you just forget the club suit and bid 4H ?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|swanson: With less, East is required to simply raise 1@H to 2@H and forget about spades.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|keylime: I would bid clubs, to cater to short hearts - with seven of them, and the side club suit, I want to clue pard in to my hand; I certainly will have probably one more bid|pg||

nt|santyclz: Are we watching leaders or random draw?|pg||
nt|nickf: to be expected. MAtheson is the current Australian Open Pairs Champ - he's about 20 and Jan Cormack has been a leading international for about 30 years|pg||
nt|nickf: 1 table from the 7 table final|pg||
nt|mariner1: my guess is leaders,,,,, Nick probably knows|pg||

nt|nickf: Barometer|pg||
nt|swanson: N-S are on for game here but it will not be asy to bid.|pg||
nt|janm: Especially if West starts with 2@s|pg||
nt|mariner1: well with only 7 pairs we could have a Howell or similar|pg||
nt|nickf: the scorers hope to provide almost real time scores|pg||
nt|janm: So much for 2@s|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: bid out of term and accepted|pg||
nt|keylime: I'd be thrilled to have pard give me honor-doub of my first suit with South's hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this vulnerability  2@S-1 and 3@D=  get same score  so  NS right again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no surprise -- Gill's 5@C contract on board 1 is a game swing|pg||
nt|forni: I'd say that east has a hand good enough for a 18-19 rebid, thus opening 1@C|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|nickf: players are using bridgemates|pg||
nt|cindy: S has a dandy hand here   |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|ahollan1: aha!|pg||
nt|werge: To me, West has the hand for a directly 4 @S-bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 1 @D the "yucky" hand |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: N/S are playing weak NT |pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: Gill plays transfer openings in some partnerships, but I didn't think this was one of them|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: finally a game contract that has decent chances to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: make that 14 pairs 7 tables|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 2@h is a limit for NS with careful defence.|pg||
nt|werge: But better let E/W play here|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: at first glance it may look like S  should rebid 4H, then bid 5C over 4S. but that does not have to be a suit--it could even be a void. so S wanted to bid clubs at his second turn. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: odd for a 7-5 hand to be awkward to bid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3nt ofcourse depends on locating the @Cq|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: sorry :)|pg||
nt|forni: I can agree with that|pg||
nt|forni: And even though East has a great hand if West would've bid 4@S directly, he doesn't nearly have enough aces to continue over 4@S|pg||
nt|werge: The danger is, that North - after 1 @S - can bid a leas-directing suit|pg||
nt|werge: lead-directing|pg||
nt|forni: N can bid a lead-directing suit for if W becomes declarer?|pg||
nt|werge: East MUST have showed the hand allready|pg||
nt|forni: The trouble for Peake now is: Why can't west have AKxxxx, Jxx, xx, Axx|pg||
nt|werge: OK, sleepy...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cindy: in the last set  they doubled 1D and meant it for takeout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this makes 5 of either minor - but only because of lucky @C position|pg||
nt|forni: that's why 4@S over 1@C is better.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cindy: this time apparently it means diamonds|pg||
nt|npcjpn: sure.|pg||
nt|werge: 7 easy tricks against 3 @C|pg||
nt|werge: - but East might be declarer in three other suits|pg||
nt|forni: plus NS could find their 5-red save.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cindy: kokish i guess|pg||
nt|keylime: valid point Marshall - |pg||
nt|keylime: looks like it doesn't it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: judging by the N bidding, it still means takeout|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|swanson: Seems like a losing system to not be able to get that spade suit of Wes't in the auction immediately.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H over 1@S is interesting to me..... not passing to try penalty|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|keylime: Kokish for those that don't know is 2@c-2@d-2@h, where hearts are either natural, or showing a specific range of balanced hand|pg||
nt|cindy: kokish makes these big balanced hands easier to bid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the @d overcall and support have steered them to 4@H|pg||
pc|h7|nt|janm: Interesting decision for South when East opened out of turn - I wonder if he'd have done better to have the bidding revert to West|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: I think it was a slip of attention for both|pg||
nt|keylime: hence the forced 2@s call.|pg||
nt|werge: Did´nt West bid his hand twice (at least..)|pg||
nt|werge: This will be 5 @S probably one down - @d- to the ace and misguessing the @C-suit|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: hi zh |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|cindy: yes  it was N last time that doubled for takeout and S thought it was diamonds|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry privie|pg||
nt|cindy: they didnt discuss apparently|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since i'm the only commentator -- if there are things you'd like me to cover rather than random raving -- just send me a chat message|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cindy: didnt matter here since N chose to not Stayman|pg||
nt|keylime: named after the brilliant Canadian theorist, Eric Kokish.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is 2S 100% forced, then? i'm thinking it's better if N can bid 3H with spades, to get the play in the S hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: either before or after the misundersatnding|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Ohno beat the Hackett team (MELBOURNE - DE LIVERA - HIRST - HACKETT - BAKKEREN - BERTENS) this morning in a 24 board match  to make the semi finals |pg||
pc|d9|nt|cindy: 8 card fit and lots of hcp but slam would be very difficult|pg||
nt|cindy: 2S is forced in kokish|pg||
nt|keylime: normally when i got to play Kokish it was almost 100% forced, unless I had a single suiter or certain 2 suiters.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe Yamada needed to raise to 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that would probably only make the auction less convincing|pg||
nt|npcjpn: south's first pass was a surprise.|pg||
nt|forni: that's not impossible :)|pg||
nt|werge: With thusd dummy, North can´t play others than a @C NOW|pg||
nt|forni: remember I called that 4@D with north's "5-5" in the red suits not the right contract? Other table decided to bid up to 5@D, winning 5 imps for Ohno.|pg||

nt|davidstern: This event started with 246 teams. Six survived after 10 rounds of 10 boards. Top 2 to the semi-finals and the remaining four playing off for the other two spots|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cindy: wouldnt it sort of defeat the purpose if 2S not forced ?|pg||
nt|keylime: open room is about to start on board 1, so we're going to have comparisons soon.|pg||
nt|werge: He smelled the misfit|pg||
pc|s5|nt|swanson: The problem with trying for a penalty is that N-S surely have a minor suit fit and might be able to take a lot of tricks there - as they can here.|pg||

pc|s3|pc|d2|nt|swanson: Netherland had a solid win over Sweden in the finals of the team event yesterday.|pg||
nt|werge: I think we have a problem here - for how long can North wait before smitching to the obvious @c?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|santyclz: Might have done better to lead another trump.|pg||

nt|davidstern: Temperature is 32C or 91F outside and very pleasant|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: I am surprised he ruffed with low club|pg||
pc|s2|nt|keylime: certain hands like, both minors, can be hard over a strong 2@c hand|pg||
nt|keylime: hard to bid I meant|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no, i don;t think so. it ought to be possible to arrange alternative structure so that N & S can rveeal their hands while still allowing S to be declarer|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i don't think it would matter|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: he isn;lt going to cross to dummy with the 9, he is going to ruff cards in dummy|pg||
nt|npcjpn: yes, still, may have a game, though pass worked weil.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|werge: OK - try for the @H Queen-drop - or guess the @C-suit. Good luck|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|davidstern: The four playing off here are Japanese Senior, Giura Melbourne, McGann|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s6|nt|werge: But how strong might East be passing over 1 H?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|forni: But australia takes back a swing on board 12 by bidding 3NT, which will be made|pg||

pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|vugrapha3: Gill not happy with his spade switch... shaking his head|pg||

nt|marlowepi: he was expecting H ace in S|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cindy: another advantage of kokish is being able to open 2C on two suited hands|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|h4|pc|cT|pg||

nt|vugraphzkv: Hi, Jon :)|pg||
nt|panja: 26 HCP..they will just about make 3Nt because SQ is in|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|danilo1: eventual overbid by West or East may be dangerous ... slam may be tried by partner than|pg||
mb|d!|nt|santyclz: But if they bid 3nt it's unlikely to be monotonous.|pg||
nt|lestergold: lose 2h and a dim |pg||
nt|lestergold: true!|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: 16 seems ok for a srtong 1 @c?|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the spade fit land dim singleton with east makes this and an unlikely candidate for 3n|pg||
nt|danilo1: as it is happening ... East will probably try slam now|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is the drawback of the multi--North should double now I think--partner is marked with spade length|pg||
nt|garnetts: IF west started with 2@S I doubt North would bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: South must deceide between pass and 4@H|pg||
nt|garnetts: Pass looks a better bet as it is almost certain to go plus|pg||
nt|fifee: or 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 4 tricks in @H, 3 in some minor, two in @S...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this can be -1   |pg||
nt|panja: of course he could steal one more in other minor..|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: quickly or slowly |pg||
nt|wwalter: thay play prec, so under 15|pg||
nt|jbgood: som spade contract coming up? 4 is good - but the club split and the spade loser makes it very difficult|pg||

nt|marlowepi: you mean, if the opps don;t crowd you. but that is the reason why players don;t like to open 2C with 2-suiters in the first place|pg||
mb|1H|nt|cindy: yes i know|pg||
nt|keylime: I had to go retrieve a guest downstairs :-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Horwitz wants to bid -- but  nothing available|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: There is a very heated director call in the other match so players finding it had to concentrate|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|sybarra: and he/she survived|pg||
nt|werge: Here only the bidding has interest|pg||
nt|npcjpn: twelve tricks.|pg||
nt|werge: - 6 @c being ice-cold|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|keylime: she survived the 25 story ride in a really cramped elevator thankfully :-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Most experts around here respond with the South hand.  There is minimal playing strength but passing mades life so easy for the opponents.|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 2NT seems like a lot to bid on that hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: i wouldnt bid with S hand |pg||
nt|cindy: too dangerous for me|pg||
nt|sybarra: was just going to make same comment |pg||
nt|marlowepi: but this is cold on the intrafinesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: seemed really optimistic|pg||
nt|npcjpn: but it may not so easy, 3@c does not promise a solid suit.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mariner1: 2N will not fare well here ,,,,, to much out and off|pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart king, then D to the 9|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - my firt name is Hans|pg||
pc|d5|nt|keylime: I have nightmares of -500 in a partial with South's hand|pg||
nt|cindy: or 800 :)|pg||
nt|keylime: at least they are 5-5 and not a frisky 5-4 as some would have|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would bid. |pg||
pc|dA|nt|keylime: 2nt is pushing a bit with the weak diamond suit|pg||
nt|mrdct: this could be a good result horwitz - NS can makea few @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this won't be as easy as the @C games|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|swanson: If you Google Yeh 2009 you can find the site for the tournament.|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.yehcup09.com.au/  - Tournament site|pg||
nt|keylime: I think to be fair, it depends on the NT defense|pg||
nt|keylime: if you're a DONT user - 2@d fits the bill |pg||
nt|npcjpn: so depends on a lead.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|werge: Difficult to find the @s-lead|pg||
nt|npcjpn: bravo!|pg||
nt|werge: Voila - as the say in France|pg||
pc|dK|nt|swanson: Declarer might will guess diamonds - after all SOuth did pass 1@H.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome Dave!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|swanson: well|pg||
nt|mariner1: that is the Yeh Cup site|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you could have a game opposite very little. and when you have this shape it is unlikely they will double before bidding something|pg||
nt|cindy: i wouldnt bid no matter what|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|cindy: partner is passed hand and we are red|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mariner1:  http://www.qldbridge.com/gcc/           - Tournament Site|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club ace , club and N is down|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes the @S switch on the previous bd allowed the game to keep|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|swanson: The @D8 discard will chinch it.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: do we know what the problem is Fiona ?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|keylime: I'm swayed by what pard does admittedly. I'm use to opening light in my regular p'ship; his pass probably sways me here instead of me tabling 2@d (which is diamonds and hearts for ...|pg||
nt|keylime: us)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|sunsamvar: the interesting boards are coming up. so hold on to the edge of your seats|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|swanson: So 5 diamonds and one in each of the other suits for declarer.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it seems very anti-percentage to start with the ace of diamonds|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|d9|nt|marlowepi: the very fact that you are vul means that partner's top end is higher. here you would be a favorite to make game oppsite Qxxxx of hearts|pg||
nt|npcjpn: but North has to find six discard....|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|santyclz: He pitched a @d from dummy.|pg||
nt|janm: Still looks as if this is going down (only 4 diamonds, since declarer pitched one on a heart)|pg||
nt|cindy: all of my partners open anything that moves so we might miss a part score but thats ok with me|pg||
nt|sybarra: and home now |pg||
pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: E opened the bidding, so it can;t be wrong to start with a D to the 9 and see what happens|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: can Peter divine the @C position?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c6|nt|werge: But I do´nt understand Wests choice - he needs a solid @c-suit, so how can you make 6 NT, if 6 @c is´nt absolutely cold? And partner might even have @h K x...|pg||
pc|s5|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: he has count in @S -- @H probably 44 or North 5 South 3|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|lestergold: 4h makes 5d safe even 6d may make|pg||
nt|danilo1: 6@C for NS ... may be foud since West will probably produce some oppening including @H (weak or two-suiter)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: W might enter the bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: think I might open that N hand with 1 @H |pg||
nt|tweety1: 4 makable|pg||
nt|lestergold: not that 6d is a good contract!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|danilo1: opps ...srry, @S ruff|pg||
nt|jbgood: this time 3 nt may make if they get there on the scattered values|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S will be a good spot here....|pg||
nt|panja: depends on @C guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|baldfriede: Goddess beware; definitely not a good idea to go for 6@d.|pg||
nt|lestergold: probbaly well settle in 4h|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Or he may try 3nt.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6d we can see veryhazardous even ith favourable lie of red suit honours|pg||
nt|tweety1: 3 @s seems ok|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@D alerted is?|pg||
nt|danilo1: tr. @H, thanks|pg||
nt|wwalter: 4@c-4@d|pg||
nt|jbgood: the vulnerability may induce them to get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: and after pd's 1 @S 2 @C?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Boian Halachev from Bulgaria|pg||
nt|ppilot: hi all|pg||
nt|wwalter: hi Boian|pg||
nt|danilo1: I thk South should produce one more bid - probably 3@H, partner's 3@C was free bid|pg||
nt|ppilot: if peichev bids will drive them to vulnerable game:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: Good morning Boian|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: good desision|pg||
nt|wwalter: this is better than 6@c , down :)|pg||
nt|panja: they need to find out @D weakness though, and typically, methods tell you only about Major controls|pg||
nt|garnetts: Normally that would show Dummy's first bid suit--and a decent hand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tweety1: so that N can describe his hand better|pg||
nt|jbgood: I wonder if 2 NT would be forcing?|pg||
nt|olson: will depend on lead|pg||
nt|panja: not enough HCP for Nt, and @D suit open...still bidding does not seem out of the world...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: hm is this a serious stop?|pg||
nt|lestergold: a horrible contract|pg||
nt|jbgood: I guess there is only 9 tricks in spades as well|pg||
nt|olson: chance for a pickup  now|pg||
nt|panja: and now...where should @CQ be placed..|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: communications dire apart from the pade weakness|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade weakness|pg||
nt|tweety1: with AJ in @s, S chose to bid 3nt which is not a bad option.|pg||
nt|ppilot: anyway at the other table they might bid 5 he sacriface so win 2 imps:)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|lestergold: nothing wrong with souths bid- everything wrong with north's accdeptance|pg||
nt|danilo1: Guess they would not try 6@C ... West's bid over Dble is probably @S shorth|pg||
nt|panja: % is for E to have it..|pg||
pc|dT|nt|olson: declarer should play club K  since  the 4/1 split onside can be picked  up  |pg||
nt|panja: you assume he has 4 @D at most..|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: or then 1 nt?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: DONT would've worked better here|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|garnetts: Excuse me thought i was answering a private question|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|nt|baldfriede: The @d allow somed communication, but not after playing 10.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|tweety1: may raise to 4h maybe  but he might have tht that his @hs are too weak.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: and what will he do after he has enjoyed his 5 dim tricvks?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s9|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Rob Helle|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: but he had to stay on lead in case he needed to pick up K to 3 dims|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Veysel|pg||
nt|tweety1: hello everybody|pg||
nt|lestergold: north's distribution and broken suits suggest that 3N will not be a fighting chicken|pg||
nt|rhelle: hello everyone|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi Rob|pg||
nt|rhelle: hi Jon|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: Hi, Rob :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: hi Silvia :)|pg||
nt|panja: note that the 1@D bid works as a bit of deterrent for the @D lead by defenders...|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tweety1: agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is a very lame and wounded chicken|pg||
nt|santyclz: he's home now as long as @ss break 4-4 and the aqj of @hs are singleton.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jbgood: now he can ruff a club and win if the spade queen is at most doubleton - provided the @d K takes a trick. No luck though|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mmmakela: now spades 3-3 but if not then dias a LOT better trump suit|pg||
nt|tweety1: umm|pg||

nt|marlowepi: and while we are speaking of the colors, E has opened a NT at favorable, which could be anything, especially for a dutch pair|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still - as Dave said, this could be good against NS @S partscore|pg||
mb|1S|nt|swanson: North will be under the miguided assumption that this deal belongs to his side.|pg||
nt|cindy: i know |pg||
nt|keylime: very true Marshall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm a 2@D bidder -- how about you Dave?|pg||
nt|mrdct: the @S suit likely to prevail here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mariner1: 4@H has play here EW...... no Save NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: which means, i think, that the odds on bidding are nowhere near as terrifying as has been suggested|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lol   i thought they were in 3NT. to me it looks so automatic for N to bid 3NT over 2NT that i didnt even bother to check the rest of the auction|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: not sure what problem is :) In the Cayne match|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: micheals. most use micheals for weak(below opening hand) or 16 + hands.|pg||
nt|forni: looks like 4@S by NS|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|mrdct: not a great @D suit but there are 6 of them so 2@D looks OK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when able to make overcall in suit just under opening bid -- because of preemptive value, it can be weaker than other 2 level overcalls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S a practical bid -- with EW showing 8+@S partner strong favorite to have some @S length|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think gill needs to bid again with this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  EW 8+@H -- but you knew that|pg||
nt|werge: If thisd is a weak-two - this beats the world record|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: terrifying for me   i would bid if that outside stuff were in my long suits|pg||
nt|mrdct: even though he is red vs green|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the north hand falls in between and most wd call the suits in turn|pg||
nt|forni: but|pg||
nt|werge: Here 4 @S is making N/S with only 16 HCP|pg||
nt|forni: I'm wrong|pg||
mb|4H|nt|keylime: I'd like the K@c in my diamonds. Then I'm bidding freely.|pg||
nt|forni: 3 rounds of @H will promote @SJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: moreover, bidding VASTLY increases the chances that PARTNER will get to be on lead, which is a very good thing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would he still bid 2D if he had 250 honors?|pg||
nt|sybarra: should we pour you another glass of wine?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, pleaseeeeeeeeeeeee|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: how many votes for 3nt and how many for 4@H with the south hand ?|pg||
nt|werge: Yes, 3 rounds of H ist the killing defence - when East ruffs with the @S Jack|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|ahollan1: interesting -- when i began reading books/magazines from England "green" meant favorable vulnerability|pg||
nt|mrdct: trump lead by gill might be best - althogh he has a slight problem in that department|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  not-vul vs vu|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now that i know of other parts of the world - they use it "green" = not-vul|pg||
mb|d|nt|cindy: was 2H forcing by N ?|pg||
nt|keylime: I have a glass of Lake Anna Sunset currently in hand|pg||
nt|npcjpn: probably with 2@d multi, 2@h shows sound weak two. |pg||
mb|r!|nt|janm: EW will probably think that N was kidding with the 1NT bid|pg||
nt|keylime: but I wonder if they are playing IJO's|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: not liking 3H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what did S think 2D was? if she couldn;t open the bidding surely she couldn;t bid 3H on a misfit, so she must have thought 2D was something else|pg||
nt|cindy: im happy defending |pg||
mb|6H|nt|mariner1: 5@C DBL would have been 500 however N has to much defense to save|pg||
nt|mrdct: north might put the @HJ on the tbale now|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 053|pg||
nt|npcjpn: sorry, private.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 3@c promises some values with 2NT lebensohl.|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: 5@d looks to be a decent spot here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson: Unsupported aces are not often good leads, but here there is a reasonable chance that either the king is in dummy or that North can give partner a ruff.|pg||
nt|santyclz: @c continuation makes this very tough if possible at all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H before touching trump to ensure 2 or 3 ruffs in dummy|pg||
nt|werge: 3 NT and 5 @C both should make|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mrdct: west probably not keen on playing a trump from Qxx now|pg||
nt|mrdct: all very much looking like an easy make now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now play is just for overtrick|pg||
pc|dA|nt|keylime: pushes as expected on boards 1 and 2 hence the no score.|pg||
nt|sybarra: esp. when I know what to lead |pg||
nt|ahollan1: mid @S looks automatic -- if Gill follows suit, no harm|pg||
nt|forni: Ohno will take the lead by ending in 4@S on board 14, where Gill went down one in 5@S|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: some music started playing outside so play stopped :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: diamonds are forever :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cindy: 3/2 diamonds makes it easy|pg||
pc|sK|nt|keylime: I asked Larry, who's my regular pard about the 5-5 red hand, he states he's coming in due to decent loser count. Ironically, he's more conservative than I am most of the time. :-)|pg||
nt|cindy: would anyone lead the K of hearts with W hand ?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mariner1: now a @c and defense prevails|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if nobody is dancing -- it doesn't count|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: keep the dangerous east out|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sunsamvar: once the @S king was seen with east he can be sure that the @C top honours are with west..|pg||
pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: S buys a dummy for 3H that is about two tricks better than par on this auction|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so good safety play|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|keylime: B3: 4@h got doubled and racked for 690|pg||
nt|cindy: yep|pg||
nt|keylime: I wonder if North was catering to South's somewhat yo-yo tendencies|pg||
nt|marlowepi: oy-oy tendencies?|pg||
nt|cindy: :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: i dont think yamada has the timing for a trump coup here|pg||

nt|cindy: hmm|pg||
nt|cindy: that didnt turn out so well|pg||
nt|marlowepi: did you ask curly?|pg||
nt|keylime: did declarer really duck there?|pg||
nt|mrdct: one entry short|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s7|nt|mariner1: good defense will score here|pg||
nt|swanson: THe opening bid and raise by East was somewhere in the 'weak' to 'pitiful' category so he should be surprised to be taking a minus score.|pg||
nt|swanson: should not be|pg||
nt|mariner1: we move again now........ 3 board rounds|pg||
nt|nickf: I suppose EW will move to NS here|pg||
nt|mariner1: so it looks like our EW become NS each round|pg||
nt|swanson: Matheson-Cormack had only one below par result in the six boards we saw, board 4 and that should be only a bit below average.  Good start for them.|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: 6d on the NS cards looks like a pretty good contract|pg||
nt|tweety1: which cannot be bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: being endplayed for a vulnerable game hurts - especially when you could have avoided the endplay|pg||
nt|fifee: 4@H a likely spot|pg||
nt|fifee: affter the 2@H overcall, seems easy from there|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|tweety1: EW!'s @h intervention will encourage N  for slam I believe.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz: 5 or 7 hand, can they diagnose it?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Difficult to bid it, and off if K@d wrongsided.|pg||
nt|ppilot: dont think they will find clubs and if find at bad level|pg||
nt|danilo1: what should be 3@C by South? |pg||
nt|ppilot: now popov as i know him will try 3 nt:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: :)|pg||
nt|ppilot: 3 diamond means pass or corect|pg||
nt|danilo1: if so agressive both, Dble is even more dangerous|pg||
nt|ppilot: limit 3 diamonds and ready for more at clubs|pg||
nt|panja: South should simply bid 4@S....and he did..good|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes--I think I prefer 2@S to 2@H  if were going to bid--in practice I would pass i think|pg||
pc|s3|nt|garnetts: Yes--not the worse slam I have ever seen but the trump break makes things awkward--needs care in game |pg||
nt|fifee: the pre empt makes it hard to find though|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: south has heard the slam try and has 3 bullets!|pg||
nt|tweety1: 4 @d or 4@h ?|pg||
nt|ppilot: hard for popov now:)|pg||
nt|danilo1: guess so, 3@C would be also pass/corr ... thk enough to bid 3@C, after all, it is free bid|pg||
nt|wwalter: in the first 2 rounds they made 49 VP from a posible 50 :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|wwalter: this is also strange|pg||
nt|olson: ew are playing  negative free bids   2h  was not forcing  |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Oops.|pg||
nt|lestergold: er em|pg||
nt|lestergold: perhaps 4d wasnt forcing in south's opinionm maybe just competitive|pg||
nt|lestergold: onviouslhy north must have inbtended it as forcing|pg||
pc|s4|nt|baldfriede: It looks as if N did not communicate his hand correctly.|pg||
nt|tweety1: I didnt like 4 @d either.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 NT = end of discussion|pg||
nt|rhelle: it shouyldn't make, I think|pg||
pc|s9|nt|danilo1: well, much better fit (3-2) than in first board (2-1) :)|pg||
nt|ppilot: seems popov double as weak nt meaning points so that explain all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: a little break after the board|pg||
nt|rhelle: but on this lead it will|pg||
nt|jbgood: absolutely|pg||
nt|rhelle: I guess it needed a @h lead to defeat it - impossible to find|pg||
nt|olson: W would need to double  1s  to set up a forcing sequence|pg||

nt|panja: there is a very small window for that negative free bid to work....more useful in Prec..narrow range opening systems..|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|garnetts: It does--but it would be tough enough anyway|pg||
nt|fifee: for sure|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: i must admit it does look like a competitive bid for the part score- how is south to know that it is anything other than that?|pg||

nt|cindy: it appears so|pg||
nt|keylime: nope, no curly :-)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: yes.... she is upset...|pg||
nt|cindy: did she say  ohno ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep - trying to reduce trump to equal West's length|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: yes|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: The Irish and Americans have been having a few parties :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both 5@C contracts have picked up double digit swings|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|npcjpn: in the open room, 6NT was made, so new leader.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|keylime: important for South to not overly press due to the potential 10 imp loss|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 2 @h forcing and nat ?|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|mrdct: possible tricky @S contract for EW here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: micheals again|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Americans partying cause summer in OZ|pg||
nt|mrdct: right-sided now|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: major suit battle developing here|pg||
nt|npcjpn: after a @H lead from South.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 2@S guarantees 4-card support  [DBL=3@S]|pg||
nt|mrdct: i was up there for the Yeh Cup and can certainly attest to the fact that the Amercian bridge players know how to party|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: both 4  @H and 4@S makes although there are only 18 total tricks as per the LAW|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Weak NT and 3NT on the strength of the good diamond suit|pg||
nt|swanson: This will work out very well for N-S.  Unlucky for East to not be able to enter the auction.|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to guess to cash @D to make this|pg||
nt|mariner1: interestingly any card from dummy works here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|marlowepi: very deep position to play E for 4 diamonds, which was obviously the plan from the getgo. it is not as if W bid 3S. anyway if she was thinking about that deep play, maybe she ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: should cash heart ace first just in case something interesting happens. when king falls, she can cash other top trump then ruff spade|pg||
nt|keylime: I think once the K@h falls under the ace, 4-1 trumps becomes more unlikely|pg||
nt|forni: hrm... this isn't the right contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Assuming S goes right in diamonds, which seems likely, this will be a great result for NS - not only bidding & making 3NT but an overtrick because of the lead|pg||
nt|swanson: Not finessing has the disadvantage of losing the remainder of the daimond tricks should Qxx be onside - but after the opponents run clubs there woudln't be many diamond tricks to ...|pg||
nt|swanson: take anyway.|pg||
nt|sybarra: how do "we"  (e/w) land in clubs?|pg||
nt|keylime: I think the club suit's been lost for 20 years Shirley...or more|pg||
nt|sybarra: or do they need to |pg||
nt|cindy: not by bidding 2S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think they better stay where they are|pg||
nt|cindy: i cant relate|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Bakkeren in the tank again|pg||
nt|sybarra: had several suggestion, of X with E  IF  east is going to bid|pg||
nt|npcjpn: after a strength showing redouble, direct 2@h shows (sub)-minimum opening.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: tough situation for Ish.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|cindy: dont understand the tank either|pg||
nt|sybarra: tank=thinking|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@S looks quite managable - but with some skillful play 4@S is a chance here despite the 4-1 break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: selling out when opp known to hold 8@S may convince Gill that trump are 41|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: I don't think you can cash two clubs tho after the K@h falls|pg||
nt|mrdct: "skillful" in this case means picking where the @SQ is|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: to get some information about how trumps might be breaking|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably this is rock-bottom for the 2NT range|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double with only one defensive trick understandably did not appeal to E|pg||
nt|cindy: i know   what could he be thinking about|pg||
nt|sybarra: what in the "h!@@@@  |pg||
nt|sybarra: pard has|pg||
nt|sybarra: to be bidding|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @C LEAD|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: otherwise it makes i think|pg||
nt|forni: "normally", s would open 1@C and N would bid 1NT over west's overcall.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: over tricks really count in MP however they don't hurt in Imps Across the Field either|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, he was thinking about NT. he does have an opening hand with a fit and  3 stoppers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL + pass of 2@S must put Q in North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- "must" is a 4-letter word|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: " twenty minutes left"|pg||
pc|c9|nt|werge: West shall false-card with the @h 9 - South might finesse East for the Jack|pg||
nt|forni: "the end"|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cindy: his partner couldnt bid over 1N|pg||
nt|keylime: I'm surprised that a double didn't come flying out from West here|pg||
nt|mrdct: he probably wont try to set up @C before drawing trumps given that he's only in 2@S|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|keylime: pard balanced red on white|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: I think W just happy to be defending |pg||
nt|cindy: my head is spinning|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: u need an exorcist|pg||
nt|sybarra: you are right on that Dwayne|pg||
nt|sybarra: but knowing the dutch as I do, they balance on air,  so that is why W in the tank no doubt|pg||
pc|sA|nt|keylime: declarer doesn't know about the friendly spade layout either|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it would seem more promising to lead a low diamond at trick 2|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|janm: Oops|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh well|pg||
nt|keylime: I think West has to smack the 3@h counterbalance here to teach a lesson|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well there is a block in @D|pg||
pc|s5|pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: W should have ducked that D trick|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: who knows, maybe declarer will return to hand & play another D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: If anything interesting happens -- we have frequent Japan non-playing captain available - welcome Nobuyuki Hayashi|pg||
nt|npcjpn: hi, everyone.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|hQ|nt|sunsamvar: east must take @Dk and shift to @C w/o cashing the spade|pg||
nt|werge: Very important, that West keeps the communication open - otherwise, South might win by dropping the @H Q|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|werge: Please change the two 2´s...|pg||
pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: NS are not vul, and N bid 3H voluntarily, not under pressure. yes, E did bid vul, but not immediately, and also he did NOT balance with double. meanwhile W has the WORST shape to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: have when you have a trump stack, and a huge proportion of the time when you reveal the locus of the trump stack it costs you a trick. i can understand the pass by W|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: where else could W be hoping to get a setting trick from?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: crunch time|pg||
nt|werge: by East|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|npcjpn: this NS pairs have been central of bridge of Japan.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mariner1: kibber reminding me what Aunt Mattie says|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer's play was reasonable, if ineffective.|pg||
mc|10|nt|forni: trouble now.|pg||
nt|forni: W lead his smallest spade, probably 4th best...|pg||

mb|2S|an|weak|nt|fifee: 4@H makes |pg||
nt|garnetts: They will probably bid it now|pg||
mb|3H!|an|invitation|nt|rhelle: @d 2-2, @c finesse right ... no such a great slam :)|pg||
nt|daman: most of the Bulgarians play precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: heading to 3 nt|pg||
nt|tweety1: strong club system is very common in Bulgaria I suppose.|pg||
nt|sybarra: must be a club system with that 1 @D opening |pg||
nt|mmmakela: my estimate is that 4xp with today's aggressive bidding happens maybe 1/200 deals about|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: no slam played by south due to the heart ruff|pg||
nt|ppilot: 5 clubs 4 SPADE|pg||
nt|danilo1: guess 4@S Dbled ... not probable West will get chance to mention @C|pg||
nt|jbgood: may even only be 11 tricks..|pg||
nt|daman: so they open any 11 point hand 1@D|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S might have been a reasonable spot for EW here..but the 51 break will kill it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tweety1: 2 KC out anyway|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, you need to ruff 2@s and 2@c ... and after 2 rounds of trumps you have only 3 trumps left|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@h is an interesting bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: so only 1 loser - but also only 11 winners:)|pg||
nt|olson: not ewnough  points  |pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|baldfriede: Yes, @h ruff will set it.|pg||
nt|lestergold: a sensible spot|pg||
nt|tweety1: good judge by N this time:)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: 3n was fine too but dont blame north wanting top lay in dims|pg||
nt|daman: forced to rebid his 4 bagger :)|pg||
nt|panja: y..but xxxx @H opposite @HA...and @C body working|pg||
nt|olson: declarer would also need to pick up clubs  for  4 winners  and this is  anti %  |pg||
nt|olson: since the  diamonds  are  2  losers|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: just in case there is a hole in one of the black suits|pg||
nt|jbgood: should really be a big takeout 3 @h|pg||
nt|daman: this contract will be tough to make|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5 min won't fair but 3 nt has chance|pg||
nt|panja: y, not enough strength to bid any game..|pg||
nt|panja: @DT from JT9..I guess it promises Jack..|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|tweety1: needs to duck the 1st @s to make.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ppilot: as it can be seen luck is with the brave|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@C by South is much better bid than 3@S ... he is limited in precision, and hand is very good, esp. since 1S should be 5+|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT has 2 chances....slim and none|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ppilot: wonder how much time this will last ? no duplication at all and still many stones to be made|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mmmakela: good lead director bid, needs to duck 1st|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and guess hearts|pg||
nt|tweety1: and also 2-4 leads are common too.|pg||
nt|rhelle: ouch ... why didn't south introduce his @d?|pg||
nt|rhelle: clearly didn't get the meaning of 3@h|pg||
nt|jbgood: strange he didnt want to play the 9 card trump fit..|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mmmakela: not with 3-lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: welll declarer will have a high blood pressure momwent shortly when he leads a dim from dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think e will have at least a mini tank and then run the dim in any case|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|lestergold: next time someone will lead their singleton holding Kx dims!!|pg||
nt|rhelle: but if North ducks 1 round of @h, he should get a fair way here|pg||
nt|daman: now return a @H and duck|pg||
nt|daman: then it is 2 down|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|garnetts: Chance of a reverse Grovesnor Coup  here--drop the Q@H under the A@H --the grovesnor coup involves playing the Q from qJx to annoy declarer|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|tweety1: @h ace must be in S to make.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Martin Garvey|pg||
nt|olson: S should  switch  to the  Jack of H   |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jbgood: if N has a 2 suiter - she would have bid the second duit directly - I think - so she must have @d also. Perhaps a redouble of 3 NT would have made it crearer to S|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, I think you're right, Jon|pg||
nt|rhelle: maybe South thought that 3@h just showed a very strong hand, and after 3@c a monster 2-suiter|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@c, sorry|pg||
nt|rhelle: which is not unreasonable|pg||
nt|rhelle: but a XX over 3NT would clear it up|pg||
nt|rhelle: now North has blocked the @d suit|pg||
nt|jbgood: is this really how the @d suit has been played? The 6?|pg||
nt|rhelle: this is not going to go well|pg||
nt|jbgood: depends on what team you are rooting for..|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes ... I am impartial, so I'm just looking from declarer's perspective|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: Danailov is thinking|pg||
nt|rhelle: and I unserstand why. Is he going to try and cut down on @c ruffs by returning a trump, or trying to get declarer trump short?|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps he thinks that N is 6-4 in the blacks (as S may think too)|pg||
nt|thegarve:  afternoon|pg||
pc|c3|nt|tweety1: blocked|pg||
nt|lestergold: phew|pg||

nt|daman: the Garve   welcome  |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Congrats on the Camrose win. Great stuff!|pg||
nt|daman: Popov has decided to let them make this one|pg||
nt|panja: note that because Declarer will get forced, he will make only 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|olson: called a  surround  play  incase  declarer has  q  or  AQ|pg||

nt|santyclz: May save a few mps.|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: Ohno 4 more ims on 16|pg||
nt|mrdct: so that board is potential gain for ohno if thay bid game next door|pg||
nt|ahollan1: contract was ok at that point - could ruff in dummy exit with loser and still have trump KJ intact|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: as the @s ruff provides the back entry for the @DA and club discard|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: he is ok becos @C lenght is on his left|pg||

nt|npcjpn: nine tricks for both sides.|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|npcjpn: NS playing weak notrump. but this North hand is too strong for strong notrump.|pg||

nt|forni: sound-proof screens? Or did Peake hear Gill screaming?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: there they go again bidding opps suit :)|pg||

nt|forni: very|pg||
nt|forni: but|pg||
nt|forni: as the cards lie... 4@H makes.|pg||

nt|forni: unless NS decide to lead trump|pg||
nt|forni: hehe|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|swanson: 3NT was anti-field - I believe one should just take their best shot to make the contract in that situation.|pg||
nt|janm: Doesn't seem as if "field" was too likely to be relevant - they were in a fairly anti-field contract, unless weak NT is more common in this field than most?|pg||
nt|mrdct: 9 tricks on top in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: here most people would bid 2H as S, showing INV + in clubs|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: and 5 more on 17|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are a million things that can go wrong, in the layout or in the defence. after all, if you had clearly misdefended two games already (as W did in the first set), would you be ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so quick to double?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 5 boards to go here|pg||
nt|werge: We are back to 9 tricks each way|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mariner1: well in Oz with transfer openers and bids its hard to tell :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously NS have had 2 hands too strong and zero that fit (11)12-14 opener or 15-17 rebid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will they rech the good 6@C here ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Pass first|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: honours lying badly for declarer and that dooms the good 5@C contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: not uncommon|pg||
nt|keylime: South might like her hand a lot now|pg||
nt|npcjpn: very cautios pass by Green.|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: was 1S-1NT-P 2S-2S-3H|pg||
nt|cindy: not that much i guess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this hand shows the power of shape and aces, NS making 6C with only 22 working HCP|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: she passed very quickly|pg||
nt|npcjpn: if West's minor reversed...|pg||
nt|werge: West should be declarer - trump lead is more difficult for Nortth than for Souht|pg||
nt|forni: true|pg||
nt|forni: but they're not in game, so it really doesn't matter anymore. Too bad, could've used some more exitement|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|nickf: but mandatory in NZ where I think they come from|pg||

nt|mrdct: should make 10 tricks now as the @S finesse is safe|pg||

nt|thegarve:  i played one contract in the last set opened 1@h showing spades and played there|pg||
nt|thegarve:  went on my tab so din't notice|pg||
nt|daman: are they still smoking?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: we will continuing now|pg||
mb|2C!|an|11-15p, 6+!C or 5+!C with 4!H or !S|nt|lestergold: i heard the food was so bad that half the players walked out of dinner and went to local curry house|pg||
nt|garnetts: Looks like 4@H again|pg||
mb|p|nt|fifee: yes|pg||
mb|2H|an|not forcing|nt|ppilot: i will never bid 1 @H seems i have to improove my biding|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@h for NS|pg||
nt|jbgood: another lucky game hand in the reds for NS|pg||
nt|fifee: NS will enter the fray though :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fifee: or would have at the 1 level but prob not at the 2 level|pg||
nt|fifee: ah :)|pg||
nt|fifee: wd Andonov|pg||
mb|4H|nt|santyclz: People never seem to open hands like e's 1@h any more.|pg||
nt|rhelle: not 5@d - that will go down on repeated @s leads|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 nt needs accurate def|pg||
nt|thegarve:  great curry house that Jon knew|pg||
nt|fifee: 4@S x off 2 and a good sac|pg||
mb|4S|mb|6H|nt|tweety1: now N's @h will seduce S :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: not impossible for N/S to bid 6H |pg||
nt|danilo1: :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: right - sry|pg||
nt|rhelle: unless declarer throws a @s by cashing 3 rounds of @h first|pg||
nt|olson: this now makes  |pg||
nt|fifee: wow :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: and 6H is frigid|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: tricky game :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: hm|pg||
nt|tweety1: S was conservative |pg||
nt|lestergold: i think south was worth 4c over his pards response|pg||
nt|ppilot: with everything ok easy 9 tricks|pg||
nt|danilo1: probable will make 9|pg||
nt|rhelle: hmmmmm ....|pg||
nt|jbgood: one forced spade ruff is enough to give defense 2 trump tricks in 5 @d - |pg||
nt|garnetts: You are kidding me :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure how South managed the double though|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tweety1: we say 'playing under the table' :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: its an absolutely throw against the wall infrangible 6H|pg||
nt|lestergold: just lose a club|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade takes care of im|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim|pg||
nt|fifee: his pd bid game :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jbgood: I am surprised E didnt bid ..|pg||
nt|thegarve:  many would not play 2@d as natural - worked well here|pg||
nt|daman: most Bulgarians play precision|pg||
nt|daman: so 2@D might always be natural|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tweety1: N wld bid 4 @d  if S bid 4 'c.|pg||
nt|danilo1: anc @C now ... maybe even 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ppilot: if they bid with like that playing later agg me will tear us into pieses:)|pg||
nt|danilo1: but guess, since 1NT ... will play safety ... @S10 from the table|pg||
nt|thegarve:  wonder why so many play strong @c?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lestergold: asm soon as north shows sign of life south will drive there- i think this was lazy bidding bu south|pg||
nt|rhelle: well, it's all academic now. I fins South 2@h bid with 9 points in partner's suits very timid|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mmmakela: 3 spades makes w right guesses|pg||
nt|sybarra: that seems a bit too good for 2 @C doesnt it?|pg||
nt|ppilot: nothing dangerous so will make lot of trick 1 im is 1 imp why miss it:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|thegarve:  in Bulgaria you could call it "natural" as so many play strong @c|pg||
nt|mmmakela: why not, good sys playing teams|pg||
nt|thegarve:  they usually play the cards well|pg||
nt|panja: difficult to attribute fault to that lead..|pg||
pc|c8|nt|olson: NS had 4 winners  on a non diamond lead  but the  lead  was somewhat normal  with 2 aces|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes if 15 upper limit|pg||
pc|h4|nt|tweety1: two Qs damages the beauty of the hand:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think he showed at least 18-19 of his points.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|lestergold: e/wcarding what would east have played if he had held qH?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but 6-4|pg||
nt|rhelle: and I don't understand the @dK either|pg||
nt|fifee: now down 2|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think the play was poor as South is surely marked with the A@H |pg||
nt|garnetts: matched the bid of 6@H :)  |pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|nt|mmmakela: same card I suppose|pg||
pc|c5|nt|olson: E was  very happy to know  the  opps  play  Rusinow leads   when the  Q  was led|pg||

nt|santyclz: Sigh, more flat hands.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S EW .,,, NS will be in there too|pg||
nt|janm: Diamonds will be easy to guess on this hand, so only 2 of the 3 had interesting diamond positions :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: and has improved her bridge significantly during that period|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: sorry boards put in wrong|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mrdct: she has won back to back National Open Teams playing with Gill|pg||
nt|npcjpn: her debut was 1976 olympiad in Monaco.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: short break|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: we are on again|pg||
nt|werge: When I started playing bridge, South did NOT have an opening hand...|pg||
nt|forni: good ending for EW in open|pg||
mb|2C|nt|janm: I'm not sure whether the 1NT is strong, and N upgraded, or weak and N decided it wasn't worth more than 1NT - I'll bet the former, though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm trying to remember -- was Horwitz team winner of recent NOT [where Peter was winning his 3rd straight trophy]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops  -- i was typing while Dave was already answering the question|pg||
nt|mrdct: i don't believe she has ever played in an olympiad|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I haven't seen this treatment before|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - East should be partner with South here|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: they are playing board nine :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: she has played mant times in Olympiad in open category.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and why no 1N opener from North??|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mrdct: nobody plays anything natural over a 1@C opening these days|pg||
nt|werge: Can West stay out of game - 14 HCP facing an opening hand...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: weak NT allows the auction to be jacked up quick again|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lovely position for w to be in vul vs not.|pg||
nt|keylime: B6 in the open room now|pg||
mb|3N|nt|swanson: I think a trump lead is necessary here to stop game in spades.|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS should score well here|pg||
nt|swanson: BUt, of course, you first have to enter the auction.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H has play, so a make is really big her|pg||
nt|mariner1: here|pg||
nt|keylime: 2@d looks to be the Multi here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my bet -- Fiona misclick    1N-P-2@C puppet to 2@D makes more sense|pg||
nt|mrdct: the 1@C opening might include weak NT hands|pg||
nt|npcjpn: yes, AL, after 1NT opening, thier 2@c is puppet to 2@d.|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: ok, will see board eight later.|pg||
nt|forni: there we go, more trouble for the Aussies|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: they have missed 18 :) |pg||
nt|werge: That´s the price for East double|pg||
nt|werge: East´s|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: usually start of a sign-off in a suit.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: one or three club opening?|pg||
nt|werge: This can´t be the bidding - 4 @c from West!?!|pg||
nt|npcjpn: looks normal if the opening bid was 3@c|pg||
nt|werge: Sure|pg||
nt|forni: NS will be able to take the first 6 tricks.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|swanson: One reason that West could consider 4@S is that partner will have at most a singleton heart on the auction.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|sybarra: maybe 1 nt would have been better? |pg||
nt|sybarra: easy from here |pg||
nt|cindy: 2H seems auto to me with N hand|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is another option |pg||
pc|c6|nt|swanson: Still, there is that dark red on the boards looking at West.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: i think i understand the bidding through 1S after that i am lost|pg||
nt|cindy: agree|pg||
nt|keylime: I would have bid 1NT, if not, honor-9 isn't bad for 2@h|pg||
nt|mrdct: this is a pretty handy start to the match for Horwitz|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|keylime: and 10 more imps for 3NT making 4 on B6 for Melbourne|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember - this is just 1st of 4 10-board sets|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board for this set -- next scheduled to begin in  25 minutes, but everything running late today, so who knows|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will we get it back ?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|cindy: S doesnt like to pass|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: yes so far nobody had commented on the reopening double|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: and "flopping the @H suit)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: cross ruff to 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
nt|forni: I think Gill tried to create a big swing|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|santyclz: Forgot to lead a @d.|pg||
nt|janm: I think a diamond from West would have beaten this - declarer couldn't get off dummy|pg||
nt|keylime: I would have if possible, rebid 1NT but that may indicate a better hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: EW would be playing 1S against me|pg||
nt|cindy: i was trying to think of something nice to say|pg||
nt|sybarra: cant be but so good,  N was a passed hand|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i lost the play...|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: sorry for this ...|pg||
nt|cindy: and couldnt make neg dbl or bid 1N or raise hearts or anything over 1S|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|swanson: West missed a chance to lock declarer in hand and would have set the contract (aftger ruffing the club)|pg||
nt|swanson: in dummy|pg||
nt|janm: Guess the diamond suit was interesting here after all - declarer has to decide whether to pitch a club, playing for the diamond Q onside or whether to pitch a diamond and give up a ...|pg||
nt|janm: club, going down 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has an awful suit, no real support for any other suit, N is a passed hand, NS are vul, NS have no game, and essentially S has a defensive hand. i wouldn;t dream of reopening ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: under those circumstyances, or even HALF of those circumstances|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sunsamvar: i think it was safer to take the @Sa on 1st trick.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|janm: He's going for the make|pg||
pc|dK|nt|swanson: West could save time and concede.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: four inevitable losers now.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|janm: At least I think so - but maybe now deciding whether to hook the diamond?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s2|nt|swanson: The BBO play would be to discard the @DQ.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|mariner1: well now if @D off he is off 2|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugrapha3: He could have hooked to the T@d, I spose :)|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer should not have taken the gratuious sulff and ruff in dummy and would have made another trick.  West, on the other hand must duck the first heart, win the second and lead ...|pg||
nt|swanson: a diamond.|pg||
nt|janm: I think declarer had a complete count on West's hand, so knew that if the @d Q was on, it was dropping|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not really after e showed out on the 4th @s.|pg||
nt|mariner1: right John, and he should not have cashed the last @H|pg||
nt|swanson: It's true he could lose control my ruffing in hand, pulling all the trump and then lose the diamond, but the defense was in position to force that.  Something about looking a gift ...|pg||

nt|danilo1: number is right ... the way to them has been little strange|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes ... i'd be tempted to bid 2@s in the pass out|pg||
nt|jbgood: this may be an interesting bidding contest|pg||
nt|rhelle: the NS policy of staying low with near-game values is working for them|pg||

nt|lestergold: west will invite|pg||
nt|lestergold: and east accept|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: South's hand meris another @h bid, in my opinion.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: or 3?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: merits*|pg||

pc|c3|nt|tweety1: wow|pg||

pc|dT|nt|ppilot: wow dont believe my eyes:)|pg||

pc|h9|nt|mmmakela: if pd's @C A had been @S K but...|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1-way traffic so far|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes tough set for Shato R |pg||
nt|mmmakela: and previous yet to be scored|pg||
nt|sybarra: next hand will be half way thru this set, so maybe worm will turn|pg||
nt|mmmakela: NS even got away with that 5 @D -3 -300 as push|pg||
nt|tweety1: EW arguing? :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Israel going to final in White House junior tourney beating Italy in semis|pg||
nt|mmmakela: cigarette break Silvia?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: yes :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: revoke in OR last hand I guess|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jbgood: a nice contract if hearts had behaved..|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|rhelle: absolutely! I like North's 3NT bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h doomed too this could well be fairly flat|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|tweety1: seems he will make it|pg||
nt|fifee: one of the hardest things to do is to put the last hand out of your mind and think only of this one|pg||
mc|9|nt|ppilot: andonov tryed them after the kik to finish them and sucsess is with the brave|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: break now|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree--but this time EW were hardly to blame--lousy contract which was always likely to make |pg||
nt|fifee: :)|pg||
nt|fifee: when in doubt, always lead a @S?|pg||
nt|ppilot: J@S was best return to make declace cover|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes it was |pg||
nt|fifee: true but perhaps hard for west to read as well|pg||
nt|garnetts: Then duck the spade back|pg||
nt|ppilot: not so hard but who knows for us is easy seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have to admit that it is hard to think of a good lead by west--I might have led a @D |pg||
nt|ppilot: i should lead one of major aces to have a chance to recover but cant say which one:)|pg||
nt|ppilot: but with any of them this time will do|pg||

nt|sybarra: 1 @S=transfer to 1 nt |pg||
nt|sybarra: (my guess)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the sun, the san, the adventures at seaworld, the night life.. had a ball|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: oh i was on holiday and not playing bridge :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: it is getting a lot of international interest especially with the Yeh Brothers being held here this year|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|cindy: what now ?|pg||
nt|keylime: 3@s is a misstatement of the hand|pg||
nt|cindy: N put S on the spot|pg||
nt|keylime: 3@d as well|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D or 3H, depending on agreements|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: in the open room, after declarer found trumps break, he took a safety play in diamonds, cashing ace first.|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|npcjpn: many thanks to our great operator.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: N should just bid 3N|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 2 boards to go after this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have power issues too - but more organic|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|mariner1: now I would not find 1N here|pg||
nt|swanson: E-W should find 4@H and make on a crossruff.  Declarer will need to ruff the third club high to avoid an overruff.|pg||
nt|mariner1: no|pg||
nt|keylime: with 4333 I am heading straight to 3NT once 2@h hits the table as a choice of game|pg||
nt|npcjpn: no double by South?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|janm: I think it depends whether EW are playing weak or strong NT. If weak, this is reasonable - treating the hand as a strong NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: That should solve the ruff problem.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: and South really passed?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: bidding not acurate. I missed the auction sorry|pg||
nt|forni: ...|pg||
nt|forni: I'm not sure what I want to say|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i bet not actual auction - Fiona entered just to catch up|pg||
nt|npcjpn: and many thanks to organizer and kibitzers.|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well, i don;t think it is clear at all. the right contract could easily be 5D, 6D, 3NT, 4S, etc.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for me, 3C is clear|pg||
nt|keylime: I liked the double for that reason Marshall - to cater to the maximum number of hand types|pg||
nt|cindy: i dont like 3C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but S cannot bid 4H|pg||
nt|cindy: N is the one with the Q of clubs and 4333 shape opposite a minimum hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: same principle for 3C. the golden rule of constructive bidding is that the 3 level is for game exploration. so whenever strain is in doubt, that is what the 3 level is for. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: choosing not to use it means you are pretty sure you know the right contract. i would not be at all sure of that holding the N cards|pg||
nt|forni: either: well done by NS, good stop in 3@D|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|forni: or... Gill, why on earth wouldn't you bid 3@S?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|mrdct: horwitz will be delighted with a 33-1 start given that they can now play their all-pro line-up for the rest of the match|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cindy: N has notrump cards  queens and jacks|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: might wish he had played another @H?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks to our operator Fiona Brown - especially with the laptop problems|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|mariner1: this is a hand where its very important to count your tricks to make sure you end up|pg||
nt|mariner1: with enough.... and more than once|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|cindy: i dont like complicating the bidding while giving away tons of info to the opps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fun and good input from fellow commentators Dave Thompson [Australia] and Nobuyuki Hayashi [Japan]|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|cindy: just bid 3N and be done with it|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 7  tricks now|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mariner1: so making 4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i don;t like giving away tons of IMPs to the opponents. in any case, it is not like bidding fast can leave them in the dark about what to lead here. there is no downside in using ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the bidding space, you already know what they are going to lead|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|keylime: Ohno with their first swing - 3NT down 2 in the other room|pg||
pc|h6|pg||

nt|tweety1: yes  = shows haralanov' pass wasnt good|pg||
nt|danilo1: anyway, after 3@D already shown, thk 3@S proposition instead 4@D was just gratis ... cannot have 5 cards @S, so cannot have better hand foor that ... North, if shorth in @H may ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: well accept 4-3 fit |pg||
nt|ppilot: but seems they need it as soon as possible|pg||
nt|rhelle: truly unlucky|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@h by NS, I predict|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h looks straightforward enuf|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no has 9|pg||
nt|daman: West could find himself in a bit of trouble on this hand if he gets too frisky|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht lead ducked- are u sure?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: nice 3 nt here|pg||
nt|thegarve:  yes makes|pg||
nt|olson: probably 3n  with  26  hcp and balanced hands|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|jbgood: not easy to bid after a strong NT |pg||
nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
nt|lestergold: well could be some fireworks here|pg||
nt|olson: do NS play a strange  1n overcall  to show suits  ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: anyway one thing is to comment quite different to play at the table|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  a trap hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: well north likes it too much to double e/w do well in 3d|pg||
nt|mmmakela: isn't S forced to act?|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|mmmakela: 2 @H/@S here|pg||
nt|ppilot: quick cofee and little luck or we may have new leader|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s do badly in anything|pg||
nt|thegarve:  should reopen with a double|pg||
nt|garnetts: It is |pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|danilo1: 1@S helps , 2@S even more|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: I'm afraid I have to go ... enjoy the bridge, everyone|pg||
nt|rhelle: bye|pg||
nt|jbgood: bye Rob|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ppilot: 11|pg||
nt|lestergold: south might have given it a preemptive raise after the double by East but at the vulnerability i can understandthe reluctance|pg||
nt|olson: does anyone  know  why the dbl  was  alerted  ??|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I am surprised N didnt bid 2 ht |pg||
nt|danilo1: ... for 2 overtricks ... thanks good, only overtricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: S may have but 1 sp|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: spade lead best but...|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@S shows hearts here|pg||
nt|ppilot: yes they play puppet|pg||
nt|garnetts: North would do well to try the Q@S or even a heart|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: a bit offshape for a re-opening double and a bit weak for repeating spades|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tweety1: 1nt with single @s?|pg||
nt|jbgood: not too many ruffing values on the S hand:)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mmmakela: weak haands play better in long suit of their own|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I'd bid 2 spades too|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|mmmakela: in my sys must do 1 or the other|pg||
nt|garnetts: This a hand where declarer should focuss on one thing getting three diamond tricks and that means south holding Qx|pg||
nt|ppilot: end of the game maked|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: then you need to have very sound openers|pg||
nt|thegarve:  no wastage|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: smoking break|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|thegarve:  nah just need to play the cards well|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|thegarve:  funnily south may not make his a@s|pg||
nt|ppilot: made sry|pg||
pc|c9|nt|thegarve:  if they kept playing trumps|pg||
nt|thegarve:  hmm North aptiently waited in the other room|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: his ace of spades or long club is same difference|pg||
nt|lestergold: the auction in closed was from outer spac e|pg||
nt|ppilot: my bridge is better than my english:)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h4|nt|lestergold: north must have thought that christmas had come 9 monthsn early|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mmmakela: if pd has bad hearts N hand about useless maybe|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ppilot: not all the time i must admit:)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: ive waited for years to hold north's hand against oppos 4h game|pg||
nt|thegarve:  it was vulnerable and everyone knows by now that you mustn't miss a VUL game|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am certain my Bulgarian is worse than either |pg||
pc|hA|nt|jbgood: could have secured 10 by giving up 2 club tricks - now the club finesse was needed|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|danilo1: with AKQ in @C, thk 2@S was not good bid ... West Dbled so opponents will probably play|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|keylime: weak NT by South here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@S, 4@H and 3N here EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: bingo|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|sybarra: you are peaking dwayne|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very hard bid for N now|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has play issues so 4 of a major seems best|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS presumably play that this sequence shows genuine club length by S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: fortunately for S she has an easy pass|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but the play could take a while|pg||
nt|cindy: i keep wanting to say bingo, keylime|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: not so easy it seems....she is in the tank|pg||
nt|cindy: u already said that marshall|pg||
nt|cindy: i just saw that|pg||
nt|cindy: i thought that before   last set :)|pg||
nt|keylime: she might bid 3, out of the thinking that she needs to "protect her teammates"|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|vugrapha3: she passed|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: yes, N didnt bid 2D, so 3C ought to be INV|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cindy: everyone agree with 2H ?|pg||
nt|keylime: the 9@d led against the 3NT in the other room which hit paydirt|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mariner1: this makes with careful play|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that was an illadvised cover|pg||

nt|lestergold: 2n response by east in the other room was the bonkers bid of the day sorry week maybe year|pg||
nt|garnetts: This should make next door too surely?|pg||
nt|ppilot: easy 4 spades here|pg||
nt|garnetts: probably bid it now|pg||
nt|ppilot: and think and will open it:)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mmmakela: wonder what 2 S promised|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This was one of those hands where I think everybody would prefer 1nt opening to 1@s opening, even those who usually open the major if they have a 5 card one.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: nice bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ppilot: break nothing interesting here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tweety1: 2 @s|pg||
nt|tweety1: ?|pg||
nt|tweety1: promissed a misclick|pg||
nt|olson: 6c  will  make here  but  4s  is likely  to be the spot|pg||
pc|c3|nt|tweety1: hmm|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok 13-16|pg||
nt|tweety1: do EW play multi then?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so 1 @S must be 9-14 or alike|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 9-12|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: not multi|pg||
nt|tweety1: so how do they bid their weak 2s then pls?|pg||
nt|tweety1: yes, it is getting more and more fashinable.|pg||
nt|tweety1: even the 5 card Maj  doesnt need to be that weah:)|pg||
nt|danilo1: East should maybe try Dble ... if not penalty ... 4!NT (if 4@DS Dble pen) I would not|pg||
nt|lestergold: now a more viable 4h available for e/w|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: hm i predict 3n by west down 1|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|tweety1: weak|pg||
nt|garnetts: Might panic perhaps and allow the 10@S to make |pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: or spades|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: not sure we know |pg||
pc|c6|nt|danilo1: and poor West ... countein his @SK ... still, I agree with east's (unlucky) Dble|pg||
nt|ppilot: the other pair of ilko gains imp after imp on overtricks but need a lot of such hands to recover:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: but probably a push|pg||
nt|jbgood: a question of cashing the spades|pg||
nt|daman: on a @C lead you need to find the @Ss|pg||
nt|daman: same in either contract|pg||
nt|thegarve:  must have been confident of 4-card @S not to investigate|pg||
nt|mmmakela: guess play 4c majs|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed u have more time to explore in a heart contract not that declarer is likely t pick up enuf info to make the right guess|pg||
nt|thegarve:  4@h is bettear as you can make a few discovery plays if @H are 3-2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well must have had a friendly defence in open room|pg||
nt|thegarve:  make the @S guess straight way in the open room|pg||
nt|lestergold: in 4h you will discover that south has the doubleton heart and u may therefore play south for three spades|pg||
nt|thegarve:  you can discover that south has KQ@C and did not open the bidding|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and a@d|pg||
nt|daman: a @C lead is the best|pg||
nt|lestergold: well jack of spades most likely to be placed on distributional considerations rather than as a high card placement|pg||
nt|lestergold: still all academical|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mmmakela: 3-level I guess|pg||
nt|tweety1: dont think so:)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so they pass them because 1 @S could be even (7)8-12 maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: they don't have weak 2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|ppilot: that is why i like andonov bid it drove to gain|pg||
nt|lestergold: easy if they are playing udca|pg||
nt|lestergold: kill point coming|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|tweety1: too mant rubish HPs in NS hand.|pg||
nt|tweety1: many|pg||
pc|d5|nt|baldfriede: Yes, would have been better to let E/W play in 3@h.|pg||
nt|lestergold: pure guess |pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: with the dim suit in dummy, there are limited defensive options|pg||
nt|garnetts: The defence have given themselves an outside chnace|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jbgood: wouldnt the 2 be better then?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: they are obviously not playing udca|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: he has comitted himself to the right guess|pg||
nt|fifee: Andonov has great instincts|pg||
nt|garnetts: The 9@S is right form us seeing and in with the odds too|pg||
mc|10|nt|ppilot: shall he make safety play of clubs or play for overtrick?|pg||
nt|daman: one-way finesse|pg||
nt|garnetts: also it wouldn't have been right to bid 4@S without the 9@S would it?  :)|pg||
pg||

nt|keylime: Ohno will be pretty happy after the stumble early on to be in this position|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for all W knew, S might have AKQx of spades and be planning to throw dummy's Ds on spades, but led stiff heart jack as a no-cost extra chance play|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|cindy: ohno gonna win|pg||

nt|marlowepi: the technical bid on the hand is 1NT, but see my profile.  24 came just in time|pg||
mb|3C|nt|keylime: 1@d = 0-6 or natural or relay|pg||
nt|keylime: 1@c = 2+@c|pg||

nt|mariner1: now they are likely off in 3@H|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mariner1: win @SA and cash Q and a @D works here|pg||
nt|swanson: It is matchpoints - IMP double would be quite wrong.|pg||

mb|1D!|an|11-15p, 1+!D|nt|tweety1: not a good defence as Dreyfus:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: running out of bds |pg||

mb|1H|nt|viren169: Hi all...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: EW are kind of paralyzed from the awful start|pg||

nt|tweety1: i m afraid i dont agree|pg||
nt|tweety1: a good 5 card suit|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, exacrtly, that's why it is not a 1nt. :)|pg||
nt|tweety1: its hard to rebid 15.|pg||
nt|tweety1: most good players try to open 1nt almost every hand:)|pg||
nt|ppilot: now doble showing di or majors i hope|pg||
mb|3D!|an|6!D and 3!H|nt|ppilot: 2 spades pass or correct:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 3@D looks best whatever it is supposed to show|pg||
nt|ppilot: 6 hearts is makable but hard to bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: hard to make surely?  |pg||
mb|3S!|an|cue bid|nt|tweety1: yes specially W seems abondoned|pg||
nt|viren169: E/W should avoid getting too high here now that West has limited his hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: N/S 3n no problem if they reach it|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess they reach it now|pg||
nt|lestergold: now will bid it i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: well 29 left so only 2,1 imps per board|pg||
nt|ppilot: sure you are right|pg||
nt|ppilot: didnt see vulnerability|pg||
mb|4C!|an|cue bid|nt|daman: do we show our NT before we show our potential @S fit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: Declarer would have to establish a trick in @s to make 1nt here.|pg||
nt|thegarve:  .......proof [fill in the name of your favourite poor declarer]|pg||
mb|4N|nt|viren169: Maybe not!|pg||
nt|lestergold: south has promised/impled spades wht isnt north showing them|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n is also infrangible|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: even 6 @d would make |pg||
nt|lestergold: will mkae at least ten tricks|pg||
mb|5H!|nt|ppilot: now this 2 he bid may get them too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6d as cards lie easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: it seems EW play Puppat stayman over 1nt here|pg||
nt|viren169: pushy 4@H|pg||
nt|ppilot: wiht king @S wrong down 1|pg||
nt|viren169: some sort of try would have been rejected and kept them out of the 4-level|pg||
nt|ppilot: sry this makes it easy|pg||
mb|6H|nt|lestergold: but not the world's greatest contract in theory|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: i prefer 3 di bid intead of 4 @H if partner might be 4 cards|pg||

mb|p|nt|tweety1: 4 @s |pg||

nt|olson: if south shows a GF hand  North may drive  to  6s|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: I doubt E/W will land in game here.|pg||

pc|cK|nt|baldfriede: Though this bid might change the scenario.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I retact my statement.|pg||

nt|olson: this should slow N down and play 4s  |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 8 tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not my idea of a 3@D bid--too much defence|pg||

pc|cA|nt|mmmakela: 3343 W isn't that strong so I'd pass 2 spades|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|olson: looking at XX  in H|pg||
nt|ppilot: wonder since both teams dont need victory to continue next why they play with so many tactical bids and risky desisions?|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|ppilot: must be something personel or just ego:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I Boian they are through anyway?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|tweety1: this set of bids seemed smart to me.|pg||
nt|tweety1: and a good sacrifice by NS|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|lestergold: i think these hands have been invented for u and martin to make fools of ourselvessomehoe or other they are not the real hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: 7 @H and 7nt here but they may find @S fit|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@C will avoid the spade fit...|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a plot by the bulgarian secret police |pg||

mb|p!|an|0-4p, ANY|nt|daman: I can't wait to be your age to find out martin|pg||
nt|thegarve:  must have opened 1@c?|pg||
nt|lestergold: uve a long way to go George|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@H is a reasonable spot for NS but hard to bid |pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: 2 @C, pick another suit pard?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or?|pg||
nt|lestergold: south's hand is not everyone's idea of an overcall with  two qxx holdings|pg||
nt|lestergold: will this psyche profit e/w?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: adio grand|pg||
nt|thegarve:  like Cliff Richard the eternal teenager|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: think I've never witnessed 20 boards without scoring a single imp other team(this is not a curse,hoping the opposite)|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry I do not know the system|pg||
nt|garnetts: That is a poor bid--why not 3@C which makes 4@H unmakeable on that lead |pg||
nt|fifee: 4@H may be hard to make with east holding 4 pieces|pg||
nt|fifee: tapping declarer from the beginning with a @C lead|pg||
mb|4D|nt|garnetts: exactly which is why 3@C was a better choice |pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Now they will end up in the wrong suit...|pg||
nt|ppilot: ilko feels robbed:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I like his bid|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: south is very lucky here|pg||
nt|jbgood: hasnt been so far in the match - and 3 @c is beyond me:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: on a bad day this would be doubled and booked for something like a couple off against nothing|pg||
nt|lestergold: u Martin about 50 odd going on about 15?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  i'm at least 10 years younget than mike|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: me im only 18 so ur 8|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: NS will be in 4 @s|pg||
nt|tweety1: that is really hard to make|pg||
nt|viren169: they should find Q@S is missing and only a 4-4 fit ending in 6@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3c is a horrfiic bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: well they have arrived |pg||
nt|ppilot: good bids unhappy but let us see the lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: a@S here makes 4@H easy |pg||
nt|ppilot: that is why 3 clubs values +fit is better|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes I agree|pg||
nt|garnetts: but maybe it still gets beaten if a club swicth happens|pg||
nt|garnetts: switch even|pg||
nt|garnetts: any red suit lead and it makes |pg||
nt|ppilot: makable after spade and club|pg||
nt|fifee: :)|pg||
nt|ppilot: will discard dymmyes clubs on spade|pg||
nt|ppilot: but wall on open cards for us all is easy here:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I bet East is cursing now--for not bidding clubs|pg||
pc|sA|nt|baldfriede: Yes, very hard|pg||
nt|ppilot: wonder if they get to right level:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: with a typical NT hand S sh be happy to pass - unless 2 NT meant something else..|pg||
nt|thegarve:  your as young as the woman you feel, as they say|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fifee: I still think that a @C lead sets it|pg||
pc|s8|nt|viren169: tough to reach 7 when the spade fit is found...|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I see no way to make it.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Rob Brown|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi All|pg||
nt|garnetts: Still if what you said is right earlier he will find a way to blame his partner|pg||
nt|ppilot: makes now|pg||
nt|ppilot: but let us see the line he will chose|pg||
nt|fifee: @C now can tap declarer and in with the @D and tap again|pg||
nt|garnetts: west is still not happy about the next lead--a club is far from obvious|pg||
nt|ppilot: 2 rounds of clubs ruf 2 spades discarding clubs from dummy and ace and diamond|pg||
nt|garnetts: He expects his partner to hold four trumps for his bid--maybe five|pg||
nt|fifee: yes the @SAce killed defense|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: ha to lkose three dims or two dims and a ruff to go offin 2s?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  needs to plan how to make 3@d tricks in defence, locking declarer in hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: on that basis martin i can assure u that im a lot younger than u but dont tell my wife|pg||
pc|c5|nt|thegarve:  nice one mike your wife doesn't know but thousands on BBO|pg||
nt|lestergold: my wife doesnt kniow any bbo members except me and david and in any case i would  claim i was lying to show off|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Mike was a teacher in his youth|pg||

pc|cA|nt|olson: overtrick n ow|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|baldfriede: There seems to be a loser in each suit.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H might have been a better spot, how to avoid 4@S is not easy to see|pg||
pc|cK|nt|viren169: Safe spot!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: 7NT|pg||
nt|viren169: Usually 4-4 fits will generate an extra trick... but not here! |pg||
nt|lestergold: bit of a hurry with his dim ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: didnt teach him much as you can see didnt teach him how to beat u in a camrose|pg||
nt|ppilot: still declare needs to find the winning line|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|c8|nt|mmmakela: easy 11|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|mariner1: of course 4@H only has chance due to 3 3 @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: very friendly defence aces played on air all over the place|pg||
nt|jbgood: and a second trump trick coming..|pg||
nt|garnetts: In fact it is obvious |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|cT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|baldfriede: No good discard for declarer.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|viren169: At a high level... it is better to play in good suits...|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
nt|garnetts: he should know he needs 2-2 @Ds |pg||

mb|2H!|nt|lestergold: 5c a bit of an underbid with a stiff heart and a massive trick source|pg||

mb|p|nt|mmmakela: Shato on scoreboard!|pg||
nt|ppilot: this vulnerability i find it ok|pg||
nt|viren169: Assuming 2@S is weak... it will be difficult for pd to judge later in the auction on other hands.|pg||
nt|lestergold: east presumably said thx for the info i want to play 4h|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s a little more awkward|pg||
nt|ppilot: needs just right guess of trumps|pg||
nt|garnetts: A number of players play a more constructive weak two via a multi|pg||
nt|fifee: since @D break, should make with wrong guess|pg||
nt|garnetts: This time there is not much to tell West how to play hearts|pg||

nt|thegarve:  hasn't cost|pg||
nt|garnetts: either way it is a sniffy lead |pg||
pc|sA|nt|olson: they are leaving the  H ace  as  entry  to  take the spade finesse  back to the  Q109|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||

nt|lestergold: do u think he shouldc have pl;ayed ten of clubs?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  dummy is going to be cut off|pg||
nt|thegarve:  10@c was a desperate play in a desperate contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: dummy is dead and one day in the future n/s are going to enjoy lots of pretty little diamonds|pg||

nt|vugraphzkv: N said that game is -1 and ... ok for all|pg||
nt|garnetts: poor defence is all one can say|pg||
nt|ppilot: may be he read his partners 2 of clubs like club holding?|pg||
nt|ppilot: 2 of spade sry|pg||
nt|garnetts: look at the biddiing partner can have nothing|pg||
nt|ppilot: smal club was better anyway still needs guess:)|pg||
nt|ppilot: now i take my words back love to be declare wit such shift:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I sometimes think defenders panic--rely too much on partner's signal and not enough on the logic of the game|pg||
nt|garnetts: Here it was obvious that dec could not discard much on what ever spades he held--so lead another trump--let nature take its course|pg||
nt|garnetts: But West did do well to lead a spade as it created a diversion|pg||

nt|thegarve:  i've heard Mike sing - like Sinatra|pg||
nt|lestergold: east with his ax of spade had no reason to bid at the 5 level|pg||
nt|olson: 3n for  3w|pg||

nt|garnetts: This is a wicked hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|an|11-15p, 6+!C or 5+!C with 4!H/!S|nt|lestergold: and u dont need a hearing aid a sa result?|pg||

nt|olson: perhaps  W can bid  2n  to show  6c and a max  |pg||
nt|garnetts: hmmmmmmmmmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|olson: or 3c  is 6c and a minimum|pg||
mb|d|nt|ppilot: this may get them too high|pg||
nt|viren169: Now they will get too high...|pg||
nt|viren169: 2N? without a spade stop?|pg||
nt|ppilot: happyly non vulnerable and not doubled:)|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@H?|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a bad shot at this vulnerbaiity|pg||
nt|lestergold: only one off against cold 5C|pg||
nt|olson: hand is in the middle range for  11 - 15  |pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: what wld N's 1nt over 1 'd mean by any chance?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not if they finmd spade ruff|pg||
nt|jbgood: will perhaps find it against 6?|pg||
nt|lestergold: too much space taken west with no aces or singletons is not bidding any sixes|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps pass (forcing) is debatable when you know prd doesnt have a positive hand?|pg||
nt|olson: now  easy  3n by W  and should make 4   or   5 on spade leads|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: wow!!!!!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: pass... not an option opposite an opening!|pg||
nt|ppilot: i am amazed too good parnership understanding|pg||
nt|ppilot: nte good news is 4 spades cant be made too:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: East getting his own back from earlier |pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: fairly agressive |pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe they have a systemic meaning for a direct 1N over the 1@D (possibly short or|pg||
nt|mariner1: artificial not sure)|pg||
nt|jbgood: amazing - they dont play presicion they way I used to do - pass not forcing?|pg||
nt|lestergold: would they have beaten 5c? a heart lead and a spade switch?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  slam has play|pg||
nt|lestergold: if u are tone deasf then how do u know i cant sing|pg||
nt|garnetts: club is best for sure |pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: but likely to make now?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mmmakela: 18-20 N|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|tweety1: so dbl  is instead of 1 nt then?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Maybe Raptor.|pg||
nt|mariner1: the DBL here probably shows @D lenght|pg||
nt|jbgood: E would be declarer - di is good enough - in on heart ace and a spade ruff|pg||
nt|daman: same auction in the other room|pg||
nt|garnetts: clearly a singleton |pg||
nt|garnetts: unless playing low from xx|pg||
nt|ppilot: that is true they play small from xx|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have never though it was a good idea and now I know it isn't |pg||
nt|garnetts: Maybe they should lead singletons with their left hand--that would do it|pg||
pc|sA|nt|starkist: 27 hcp|pg||
nt|thegarve:  I said that you sing like Sinatra|pg||
nt|lestergold: he couldnt sing|pg||

nt|lestergold: coffe break hand? easy 3n for e/w?|pg||
nt|daman: 4 boards to go and a very tight match|pg||
nt|daman: crazy result on this hand in the other room|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT  -5|pg||
nt|garnetts: If I were East I would like to find a hole to crawl into--but then again it is better to make mistakes when it is of little importance|pg||
mb|p|nt|olson: w could have  been   3226 with Kx of H and south now  sets the hand     |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this is a trappy hand|pg||
nt|olson: he knows a spade back makes  3n  |pg||
nt|garnetts: case for 3NT here as South|pg||
nt|garnetts: Or even 1NT|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jbgood: y |pg||
nt|lestergold: well a disaster for e/w in closed on a spade lead against 3n hard to play the ten and block the suit|pg||
nt|daman: spade wasn't led|pg||
nt|ppilot: 1 seems possible:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: In the good old days this would have been passed out.|pg||
nt|thegarve:  many woukd do the same bidding 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: no trumps played by east will produce a big swing|pg||
nt|olson: 110 for  ew  |pg||
nt|roswolf: this hand may blow up in someone's face|pg||
nt|olson: n  could play  3c  when south  reopens  over  2s|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: so waht happened George |pg||
nt|thegarve:  but declarer played j@d at trick 2 - thus going off|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5h 3 dims and a club adds to nine|pg||
nt|ppilot: this will get them at 4 spades may be?|pg||
mb|d|nt|mmmakela: guess another spade before hearts would've worked|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL by N is aggressive|pg||
nt|mariner1: possibly meaning long @c here?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Must mean that; else I see no justification for x.|pg||
nt|garnetts: slow pass makes it hard for East|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i see odd play in open room|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeeed|pg||
nt|garnetts: Maybe there could be a ruling asked for here|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would reopen but not if partner thought first |pg||
nt|ppilot: may be they are doing it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: Danailov is thinking|pg||
nt|garnetts: any possibility of a slow pass being queried?|pg||
nt|ppilot: if he bids only 3 his partner will kill him:)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: why on earth would anyone do that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: can anyone X?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: D Q 6 blacks, DA-D|pg||
nt|thegarve:  pressure|pg||
nt|olson: depends  if  N  has  2n  availa ble as a scramble  bid  after  second  double|pg||
nt|olson: always  lucky when  N guesses the 4 card suit to bid  that south has  4 of :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well n/s may survive this contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I would too :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tweety1: this will hurt EW a bit|pg||
nt|mariner1: well the DBL certainly seems to be working here|pg||
nt|ppilot: unfortunately hard to find diamond lead to make this game hard here|pg||
nt|viren169: b|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think that 1NT by South would have bought the contract |pg||
pc|s3|nt|daman: compression pressure|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they m ay simply cash the first 7 tricks here|pg||
nt|daman: Played the @D J to protect his @S holding and it blew up in his face|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mmmakela: made now|pg||
nt|sybarra: if defending like that better not X |pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: a little break|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if something can go wrong for W it has happened during this match, poor guy|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I gotta go too, ty all and have a nice weekend!|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have all been there (or at least I have) |pg||
nt|daman: might happen here too   but not down as many|pg||
nt|lestergold: need a very long neck to get this rite|pg||
nt|lestergold: and an ability to see thru screens to x ray vision|pg||
nt|daman: a peek is worth 2 finesses|pg||
nt|thegarve:  rubbedr necks do help|pg||
nt|olson: this can be set  if defenders  lead  clubs  after  spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: will south resist temptation?|pg||
nt|olson: he should  |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|rado: at other room W played 4@H but again no @D lead and easy 11 tricks claiemd after @S lead|pg||
nt|olson: only 6 winners   and  4d  takes  10 tricks  to get a plus score|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|olson: plus he  expects  3s  is going  down  |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: just because of the heart break|pg||

nt|thegarve:  at the bar last weekend - Mike asked for a pint of leffee beer - they wouldn't sreve them in pints (too strong) so David asked for two halves on his beahlf ...the staff looked confused|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is surely weak!|pg||
nt|roswolf: but n/s should still bid to 4@S|pg||
nt|garnetts: That is a rank overcall at red|pg||

mb|4C|nt|mariner1: S passing my stop that from happening|pg||

mb|4H|nt|tweety1: is this the final segment or?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D showing @H? or @D and @H?|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: south wont be too happy until he finds out the club position|pg||
nt|ppilot: it looks like boxing :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well I would employ the duck and jettison coup here---East should duck when West throws his cards at him|pg||
nt|ppilot: why pass at 4 clubs doubled when you can play 5 doubled???|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: saved by E |pg||
nt|lestergold: doesnt look sadly if there is any legit play for 3n now|pg||
nt|jbgood: pity S didnt bid 2 @s - then a chance of N being declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: with 4 spades to q, south may have felt that it was his place to bid the no trumps- its not unreasonable|pg||

nt|thegarve:  this is a good example of why you do not make a passive lead versus a slam where declarer has a long suit|pg||

nt|mariner1: conservative|pg||
nt|baldfriede: strong hand*|pg||
nt|viren169: well deserved 3 imps!|pg||
nt|danilo1: has been allways 170 (or 620) ... actuallly, EW lucky that South had 4 Hcp in wrong suits ... so did not jump to 4|pg||
nt|skorchev: on a 20 board match, 18 imps difference converts to 19-11 VPs|pg||
nt|lestergold: no allowed declarer a cake walk|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very slow one admittedly|pg||
nt|daman: oh well   fortune favo(u)rs the bold    and the bold just picked up 11IMPs to take the lead with 2 boards to go |pg||
nt|ppilot: no he always blame his partners|pg||
nt|ppilot: he now i suppose explain as 2 way double pass or stay:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I understand that--but there are times when you should make an effort to ensure personal safety |pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|an|16+p, ANY|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well this board aint gonna reverse that lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have no doubt that partner should pass--in which case he clearly would not save|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mariner1: the weak NT in Open worked well here|pg||
nt|viren169: E/W could get into trouble now...|pg||
nt|jbgood: This is the penultimate board in this room, and I want to thank the Bulgarian Bridge Federation and Stan Nedkov for letting us watch these interesting team matches. |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: with west opting to upgrade his hand to a 1 club opener e/w may well reach a very thin 3n which may hVAVE CHANCES|pg||
nt|jbgood: And a big hand to our excellent operator, well done Silvia Isaeva!|pg||
nt|ppilot: hope atleast one flat board?|pg||
nt|garnetts: This does not play that easily |pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ppilot: let us see if they reduce or increase 2 boards left|pg||
nt|viren169: east pass by N|pg||
nt|lestergold: didnt mean to press capitals|pg||
nt|lestergold: however n/s have offered an alternative source of points also offered in closed room but accepted here|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: also thnk you Mike Gold, England, for devoting time to guide us through these hands:)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mariner1: 1@H probably used as catch all not promising @H though no alert|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: East will be happy until he sees dummy!|pg||
nt|lestergold: well east ahsnt accepted it|pg||
mb|2S|nt|tweety1: S will play 1 nt dbled|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a straightforward auction but the play might not be so straightforward|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a guaranteed swing in one or other direction now|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like 2 hearts a dim and two spades for the defence|pg||
mb|3N|nt|tweety1: Thank God nobody bet:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: unavoidable on this lead must go off|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: also tu BBO and Roland Wald for providing software and organizing live broadcasts for the enire world to enjoy!|pg||
nt|lestergold: double now will increrase thec kleasd|pg||
nt|daman: I like DOPI for Kings over interference of my 2@C openers     that way we can catch the opps speeding from time to time and still get to our normal contract if we don't|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump switch now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: or even pass|pg||
nt|thegarve:  time to tickle 3d|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: a bit over the top |pg||
nt|mariner1: W finds a lead right into the Jaws as it were|pg||
nt|lestergold: a few more in in any case|pg||
nt|lestergold: a tickle would have certainly been my choice|pg||
nt|sybarra: low @S  lead helped |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tweety1: thats why E shld have dbled, at least for @d lead|pg||
nt|danilo1: not tragedy ... will grabble 6-7 tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: There must be a temptation to take a spade finesse|pg||
nt|garnetts: that may not allow dec to take advantage of a favourable @D position |pg||
pc|hK|nt|mariner1: though a red suit lead would have been kinder to S|pg||
pc|h4|nt|daman: EW probably think they are ahead and are just protecting their lead|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ppilot: if they find club ruff =500|pg||
nt|lestergold: here here!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim finesse followed by a lot of tricks cashing and a claim for one off|pg||
pc|s7|nt|viren169: -500 against part-score|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|lestergold: fair ebuf George|pg||
nt|lestergold: i meant enuf|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|garnetts: crucial point here now |pg||
nt|garnetts: A heart is essential but which one?  |pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: fair enuf|pg||
pc|s8|nt|viren169: a bit unlucky for E/W |pg||
nt|thegarve:  they wouldn't know that they are leading|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jbgood: Finally a big thank you to our kibs for their inputs - much appreciated! Hope you enjoyed|pg||
nt|daman: gotcha|pg||
nt|lestergold: they get a few imps for passing too|pg||
nt|daman: table presence tells you whether or not you think you are ahead in the match|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats also true Martin|pg||
nt|ppilot: small is the only chance|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: cards lying friendly for declarer  |pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzkv: See you after 45 min. for next match|pg||
mb|1S|nt|thegarve:  its round robin teams so you need the occasional 21-9 win or more to offest the losses so give it a double|pg||

nt|daman: and Bravo Silvia our very fine vugraph operator|pg||
nt|lestergold: the  3/1 ht brwak means they cant draw trumps establish all the spades in the end game they need to ruff the fifth spade and a dim in dummy but there would only be one trump left ...|pg||
