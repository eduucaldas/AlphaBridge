nt|ahollan1: sorry lowest 28|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now we will find out whether Jacobs subscribes to the modern idea of doubling (i.e. as often as possible)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: i think that south hand is a fair double of 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: all the hcp outside diamonds|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: bart bramley would dbl [in tempo] without a second thought|pg||
nt|athene: facing a passed partner perhaps he decided it would just give away information without much upside|pg||
mb|3C|an|forces 3!d|mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|athene: and when he heard the 2nt rebid he was probably happy with his decision :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: 3@C must have forced 3@D - otherwise Pilon would show @S support|pg||
nt|jbgood: only 3 spades - with the majors lenghts reversed one might be keener to double|pg||
nt|jbgood: that is the sign-off sequence I gather|pg||
nt|athene: yes, so Wolff Signoff sequence maybe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually, since advancer often bids @H when equal length - so maybe that should sway in favor of DBL|pg||
nt|jbgood: dear child has many names:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I didn't actually see the alert to 3@c, but 3@d was alerted - they're asking now|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|s3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: but as long as they go 2 or more down it's no big loss|pg||
nt|cindy:  3S does too|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S exactly one down is bad against 140|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|athene: it's a bit like going down in a grand slam:- you want to go 2 or 3 down, not 1!|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: well, someone either overbid or misunderstood here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without knowing exact definitions of 3-level bids -- 4@S sure looks strange|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: i wonder what opening 2@D would have been|pg||
nt|athene: well 2@D is strong in French Standard|pg||
nt|athene: he might have rejected a weak-2@D anyway because of the hearts|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|h7|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jbgood: needs to play a low heart to beat now|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Katz actually asked that - it would have been strong, forcing for 1 round - I think 2@c is forcing to game|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: how close is Jacobs to passed hand negative double at 3 level?|pg||
nt|athene: had to be small heart there for a ruff, then defence can play trumps and stop a heart ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|athene: now they don't have the tempo - so declarer uses that lovely @D8 on his fourth heart|pg||
nt|athene: i think south was warned off double by his red suits|pg||
nt|athene: stiff heart and three small diamonds is the worst news possible|pg||

pc|s6|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|athene: with the same hand but 2-2 in the reds, i think it was close whether south doubles 3@D|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|cindy:  and what would S do over reopening dbl ?|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c6|nt|cindy:  he would have a problem|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: so Bill -- would doubleton @H be enough of safety valve or does South hand still need another Q?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: ACBL & Rick Beye  Roland Wald [Denmark] Vugraph Coordinator and Commentator |pg||

nt|ahollan1: A great international group of commentators: Jon Sveindal [Norway] Bill Frisby [England], George Holland [Canada], Cindy Marshall [USA]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: And to all of the spectators who helped me recount George's @H suit as 7 instead of 6  actually, great chatting with all of you|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Next set scheduled for about 50 minutes, but players may decide to get started earlier than that.  Normally ACBL will bring in another match each quarter - we'll just have to wait ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: to see|pg||

nt|ahollan1: remember, there will be THREE more sets of 16 boards today|pg||

nt|athene: i wouldn't have been surprised if north had tried 3@H over 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: even though in theory 2@H is not really game-try|pg||
nt|athene: north has a huge hand on the auction|pg||
nt|cindy:  @h plays very well on this hand|pg||
nt|athene: stiff @SQ is no longer rubbish once partner shows 5|pg||
nt|athene: and the aces in the minors are just what partner wants facing his shortages|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sorry, the computer has decided not to let me enter plays - I have no idea why. The K of clubs was let|pg||
nt|daman: on this side of the pond we call "rubbish"   "dreck"|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: and minor Aces instead of slow values -- but with 2-way nmf, 2H really isn't encouraging|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|daman: yes   2@H shows a dim view of his hand|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer can even get his diamond away on the @CJ|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4-1 heart split makes it diffuclt (impossible?) to make more than 9 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I'm sorry, for some reason the computer decided the auction wasn't over and wouldn't let me enter the plays - I know that the club K was led and I'm afraid I don't know anything ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: later - looks as if 3 rounds of trump have been played, and E has ruffed a spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ralph 1N rebid shows AT MOST mediocre 14 -- no surprise George wasn't more optimistic|pg||
mc|9|nt|daman: see everyone in a bit|pg||
