nt|ahollan1: ...|pg||
nt|sartaj1: In open competition, i believe Leigh Gold,Arjuna Delivera, Ian Robinson, David Appleton will be getting their first go|pg||

nt|stewball: zia is a bit exposed to compete|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: Kx of @s etc|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|Vugraphu1: Zia actually gave a moment's thought to competing over 1NT|pg||

nt|stewball: Hamman goes for the tap with long trumps|pg||
nt|chick: club forces will do a job on him|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Zia has been studying the dummy with great concentration, still isn't ready to play|pg||
nt|3for3: no coke,pepsi|pg||
nt|kareno: But I wouldn't fade even a ten cent bet on the subject.|pg||
nt|stewball: Hammans lead is a good piece of instruction for the specs...forcing defence with long trumps|pg||
nt|chick: pepsi was playing yesterday |pg||
nt|kareno: Chick if you sniff Coca Cola you will soon look very funny... to us!!|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|chick: looks like this is going to be a loooong session|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rodwell, in CR, tried to pass out 2@s, but east balanced with 3@c, pushing them to the same contract as here|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|stewball: hamman overrules zia|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm not sure I agree with Hamman here, though those diamonds are intimidating.|pg||
nt|stewball: well i know i dont agree with Zia|pg||
nt|kareno: I hope the spades aren't compressed by the defense.|pg||
nt|stewball: he has lousy @h spots for trump plays|pg||
nt|kareno: I prefer Hamman's club attack though.|pg||
nt|chick: when partner starts a forcing defense, trying to switch to playing trumps is kinda self-defeating|pg||
nt|stewball: its so easy from up here|pg||
nt|chick: yeah, but that's still a general statement ... should continue the defense partner started (if you trust him/her) unless you can see an obvious reason not to|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Zia asks about lead - honor lead either shows or asks for honor below it|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|kareno: What is the range of their notrump?  Nine with a five-card suit is plenty if it's 15-17.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|stewball: well its a pretty ragged 9 but i dont disagree|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sorry, no one asked, I don't have their convention card and Kokish has left :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu1: Zia writing a note, probably that he had stronger raises available -|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i think DBL automatic too -- maybe part australian from previous life|pg||
nt|sartaj1: Aha. That fits in with the 4@H bid. I guess West upgraded his hand because of the singleton, and its unfortunate that he hit AKJx in partner's side suit|pg||
