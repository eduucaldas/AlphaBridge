nt|daman: and welcome|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome to the 1st of 4 16 board sets to determine one finalist for the 2009 Vanderbilt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nickell team is the  1 seed -- and had the 4th set off last night following an early concession|pg||
nt|daman: starting off with a hand for EW   either 4@H or 3NT     3NT  of Hamman has his way|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Diamond, the  12 seed -- ran late last night and won in a squeeker|pg||
nt|daman: if*|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|dburn: doubtless they spent it in carousal, while Moss, who had to struggle to the semi-final, is battle-hardened|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17   3@S=shortness and as you see does NOT deny 4@H|pg||

mb|3C!|mb|d|nt|fabsayc: they will get more expensive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even though close match -- everybody probably watching  Nickell-Diamond because Nickell DOWN  by 59|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you don't think they will conceed? :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: never|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|ahollan1: just to keep things interestin in round of 64 Nickell came back from halftime deficit of 67  -- 59?  bah|pg||
nt|fabsayc: wow , this auction is strange|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both transferring to @D?     hot potato -- you take it, no you take it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: presumably 3@C showed diamonds and north cue bidding in support|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: lots of explainations|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: Cayne team the  2 seed has 2 pairs of Italians  ours are  1 &  2 in the WBF world ranking , the other pair  4 &  5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin-Weinstein prefer to win big money tournaments like the Cavendish :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: just kidding   Bobby Levin was youngest to ever win a Bermuda Bowl and Steve Weinstein youngest to win National Event -- both feats as teenagers|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: levin is probably afraid 5@C is making|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: playing exactly same boards,  this match total imps  78,   the other match  179|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expect trump lead|pg||

nt|sybarra2: oh god, 23!  anicent |pg||

nt|sybarra2: Meckwell in 3N    Diamond in 3@S on 33 :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|vugraphzhe: so that's 9 rounds of 3 boards, played simulataneously at all 5 tables|pg||

pc|d3|nt|othered1: @S lie well for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think it was one of Lew Mathe's rules --  Never Lead Trump .... unless it's right|pg||
nt|chip: The spades spot let him pick up the suit for 3 tricks (which with 5 hearts and the club ace makes 9) if he plays W for H9x|pg||

nt|ahollan1: back in the day when game was 26 HCP -- declarer play was easier :)|pg||
