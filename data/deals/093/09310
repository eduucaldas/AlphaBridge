nt|joest: shannon will be plugging the names back in but it looks like 2@d was artificial and strong.  2@h might have been weak and they come to rest in 2NT|pg||
nt|mugsmate: I'm sure we'll get the names up soon|pg||
nt|joest: hi JOn|pg||
nt|mugsmate: hi|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Welcome to 3rd quarter of the round of 16 match|pg||
nt|joest: Declarer staring at seven top tricks and itmight well end right there|pg||
nt|joest: Jon, I have no idea whether we will see the best bridge of all four tables but I'm willing to bet we'll see the most action|pg||
nt|joest: I'll bet you a coke that Grue bids 1NT on at least one hand that you won't believe :)|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|joest: hi bill|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Grue and cheek play a fairly traditional version of precision - strong club, 5 card majors, and Lindquist Brogeland are more natural|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: sorry missed the round of carding the system had to be reprogrammed  let you know results once they claim|pg||
nt|joest: halftime scores: Nickell leads Berg 90-54|pg||
nt|athene: well, i can see seven tricks for declarer :) number eight might be hard to come by|pg||
nt|joest: Cayne over Hollman 101-39|pg||

nt|stewball: mind you they may regret it if they do....|pg||
nt|lestergold: 9on top in 3n or a more normal looking 5c|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: 5@D can be defeated with a @H lead or @S-@S-@H|pg||
nt|othered1: At one time, Italian weak 2-bids were quite sound.  East's is a more modern version.|pg||

mb|4D|nt|daman: and North only bid 2@H with that hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: te agotas fácil|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: well -- Wrang must be considered huge underdog here,  Cayne's 2 Italian Pairs are ranked 1,2,4,5 in WBF World Rankings|pg||
nt|cindy:  seems strange|pg||
nt|daman: is this auction correct operator?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: yes north only bid 2h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Italians have an uncanny success with limited hands that reopen auctions|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: I would Have whacked 1NT with the North hand|pg||

mb|p|pc|sA|nt|granguru: sorry private|pg||
nt|cindy:  2N looks like minors|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a push by versace at favourable and in spite of the 9 card fit and 11 opp 1 points- this contract struggles makes because east cannot get in tio lead a club thru|pg||
nt|stewball: best cash their @s |pg||
pc|s7|nt|mariner1: yes 1N Dbl for me too|pg||
pc|s5|nt|stewball: EOK would call this 10 imps from nowhere|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: i think the truism of the top players -- especially the Italians and Meckwell -- is that they keep opponents under constant pressure|pg||

nt|cindy:  it could happen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but what do they do when NS run to 2@D?|pg||
nt|mariner1: hand was quiet in the Open|pg||
nt|cindy:  also, might be afraid to pass 1Hx with those good clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: does versaces club opener promise clubs?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C opening is frequently 2@C in minimum balanced|pg||
nt|cindy:  dont know but double would |pg||

nt|Rafa: en la sala cerrada se enfrentan Fornasari-Palazzo (Mooney) vs Lambardi-Ventin (Lambardi)|pg||
nt|othered1: And 4@H did cost 10 imps when EW in open room had a natural-looking auction to 3N|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree with the kibbs whose messages basically blame Sementa for the last hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Unless you know their system intimately, it's very hard to place the blame there.|pg||
nt|lestergold: they had agreed clubs not hearts and his pard had cue bid hearts after sementa had cue bid dims|pg||
nt|stewball: i'm inclined to believe its a partnership matter|pg||
nt|lestergold: well someone was clearly to blame and i suspect it was sementa but maybe ive misconstrued something|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: It must have gone somethingh like double from west passed to south who bid 2d and then back to east bidding 3 C|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|mariner1: we must have missed some of the auction|pg||
pc|d4|pg||

pc|s8|pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: or maybe scramble to @S -- I hadn't considered Mike's 2-places-to-play|pg||
nt|cindy:  i guess if E isnt going to sit for a reopening double, he should bid the first time|pg||

nt|mugsmate: Good switch, now needs to cash the hearts...|pg||
nt|joest: the ten of clubs was a warning|pg||
nt|athene: Brogeland can see the @C9 so he knows the @C10 wasn't top of a sequence|pg||
nt|athene: so this might tell him his partner has nothing in clubs |pg||
nt|mugsmate: Partner needs the hK to beat this I think.|pg||
nt|athene: but it's not that clear - north might just be leading a big club through to stop declarer ducking |pg||
nt|mugsmate: Yes, but declarer sure has a club stop of some sort. If he has the hK too, 3NT must be cold.|pg||
nt|joest: he can get out a diamond right now without commiting to anything|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: :)|pg||
nt|athene: Brogeland might be considering the merits of just exiting in diamonds and playing against the dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: sorry typo|pg||
nt|athene: he can see declarer has no entry to hand|pg||
nt|joest: did Grue really duck the club?|pg||
nt|athene: i am sure Grue covered the @C10|pg||
nt|athene: it probably went @C10- @CJ - @CK|pg||
nt|joest: a winning hook would have given him nine tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: apparently lindqvist thinking...|pg||
nt|joest: yes that makes MUCH more sense|pg||

nt|stewball: the difference was a matter of judgement|pg||
nt|lestergold: slightly different auction in open|pg||
nt|othered1: so east bid an invitational 2N, then reconsidered when partner signed off at the other table?  |pg||
nt|lestergold: east has done his bit with 2n his heart suit was n lothing to write home about|pg||

nt|athene: will the 3@D bid find the @CQ for declarer?|pg||
nt|joest: even at that, there's still work to do|pg||

nt|mugsmate: It's worth checking out Duboin's line in 3NT on board 41 on the [movie]|pg||
nt|joest: but if he gives up the diamond king and gets clubs wrong he is in big trouble|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Naively it looks like this will depend on getting clubs right, which he will probably do. Lets see if Boye shows us something better.|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he might be a bit short of tricks to give up making the @DK|pg||

nt|mugsmate: I think its very hard to criticise Lindqvist for not switching. He doesn't see a rush unless declarer has 6 spade tricks, which I doubt he considered|pg||
nt|joest: in a situation like that, it's important to see that 4@s was cold and not get too upset about the result|pg||
nt|mugsmate: If declarer has a maximum of 5 spades, his cQ means declarer can only cash 8, so hearts can wait|pg||
