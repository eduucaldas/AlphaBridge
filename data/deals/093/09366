mb|4S|mb|p|nt|garnetts: 4@S made in the OR and I cannot quite see how yet--unless they took the double spade finesse|pg||
nt|santyclz: As Kaplan used to say:  I have nothing against opening a (weak) nt with a 5-card suit, I just haven't come across the right hand yet.|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: Now S needs only a stiff @H in N hand for 6@S|pg||

nt|mariner1: no making games though someone could be shoved up|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass in North may be too much timide|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bridge_one: probably N/S play level 2 forcing|pg||
nt|mayors: I would have bid 1nt on the first round as north|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes NV vs VUL he might have risk 2@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N would be sandwich or strong for most.........|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt however not so bad - now need to guess|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|mayors: not after partner has opened|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh I am nutz...... S opened 1@H :)|pg||

nt|viren169: and passing whtever response no doubt!|pg||

nt|garnetts: Also North would have been well placed to express an opinion had hsi partner not advertised weakness|pg||
nt|viren169: The 3@C had the desired effect that South intended...|pg||

pc|sT|nt|garnetts: I think East should bid 3@D after 2NT--but then again I am old fashioned why let partner know you have short hearts and a six card suit|pg||
