mb|p|nt|mdgraham: NS fairly natural, EW strong club|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and a save in @s will cost 800 witn an optimal defence|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|viren169: 1N by North assuming 1@D may be short?|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|granguru: would you bid  2@C?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@d-no 5-card major or 6-card minor|pg||
nt|granguru: I personally prefer to show 2-suited hands at once|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not any more|pg||
nt|garnetts: why 2@D on a balanced hand?|pg||
nt|sharkirl: h switch needed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes I´m very fast at the table but not on a racing course|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like a 3nt on EW|pg||
mb|3D|nt|viren169: Now is this dble take-out of diamonds or just a general value showing dbl?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|granguru: here N had an opportunity to show a great 6-5 hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but can you show the strength? |pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|viren169: pushy 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: It will get a result that is deserved--kiss of death at pairs|pg||

nt|mrt2000: lead @H towards hand twice I suppose|pg||
nt|sharkirl: what system E/W|pg||
nt|eamongall: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/camroseteams.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: well - when playing ghestem michaels copenhagen or any other....normally you have an opportunity to show the great hand by bidding again|pg||
nt|santyclz: Any idea what 3@hs was?  Obviously not preemptive.|pg||
mb|p|pc|c3|nt|eamongall: convention cards there|pg||

pc|c6|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: reckon 3@H was quite well judged - gave South the chance to bid 3N wiht good pointy-suit stops|pg||

pc|s7|nt|garnetts: The 2@D was not just pointless but ill judged with such good diamonds--well suited to No-trumps|pg||

nt|sharkirl: 3 losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: 2@S will probably be made...|pg||
nt|mrt2000: making 2 or 3 here, I suppose|pg||

nt|viren169: playing for high stakes no doubt!|pg||

nt|mrt2000: S would have been under pressure on the run of the @Cs|pg||
nt|eamongall: 4@S-1 is a sad effort by Walsh O'gorman |pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: another way to treat with this things is that the revoking player receives an electroshock when card is taken out of his deck|pg||
