nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Sheila Adamson, Bill Jacobs and Christer Kristoffersen|pg||
nt|sheila a: Good morning|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H is a pretty good spot here but NS never got the suit into the auction|pg||
nt|othered1: Here north will likely come up with an overtrick or two|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello again!|pg||
pc|dK|nt|stoffers: 1nt or 2@c as responce to the double? |pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am OK with 1NT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: shows 6-10 in my book|pg||
nt|sheila a: If 1NT promises values it's more descriptive than 2@c|pg||
nt|stoffers: yes, agree|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My 1NT is constructive, so I'd have chosen 2@C|pg||
nt|joest: I'm busy looking around on the website looking for system information|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: Hi Liz, David and Henry!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good morning Ralf- pleased to have a Swedish commentator with knowledge of the invisible players|pg||

pc|d2|nt|othered1: HI, Ralf!|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|stoffers: but then again, would have been SO nice to bid 2@s after the 1NT responce to show short @s and a good hand :)|pg||
nt|viren169: Hi all|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk4: hmmm something is wrong here. Berg-Ragnarsson playing in both rooms|pg||

pc|d7|nt|Walddk4: Operator, you sure N-S are Berg-Ragnarsson?|pg||

pc|h6|nt|Walddk4: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/league/division.php?action=view&id=1865  for standing after round 7|pg||
nt|daman: Hi agasin Markku|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so 4 @D would've been better, only 300 this|pg||
nt|joest: declarer has ten top tricks once there is no diamond lead and I presume he's about to take them and move on to the next board|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello again!|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ralfwil: not the best lead, I had not thought about it with so small cards under KQ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk4: Yeah, bad enough that I'm cloned 14 times|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In fact it s N who has to bid 2@h instead of 3@c|pg||
mc|11|nt|sheila a: Do the EU know what's going on?|pg||
nt|othered1: I think so, if 1@C was natural.  |pg||

nt|werge: red tricks|pg||
nt|werge: - and 4 @S is a winner - a lucky one|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Is there a web site for this event (Gold Coast of Australia)?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Horwitz is here by virtue of winning the Swiss Qualifying|pg||

mb|p|nt|janm: I don't know, I'm afraid.|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.qldbridge.com/gcc/           tournament site|pg||
nt|janm: I think this is matchpoints, and we'll be watching 3 boards at a time, right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that look like a 4H call to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ohno had to win a 24 board match to get back into the run for the gold|pg||
nt|npcjpn: sorry, private.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 4NT is a good save.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: agree|pg||
nt|sybarra: prefer 4 ht, but all will be well here also |pg||
nt|werge: Yes - undobled, 5 @C is the right contract, if doubleb'|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Yamada showed his hand and claimed nine :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: this is an absolutely gorgeous site..... Roland should have sent us!|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Right.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.  Welcome from the beautiful Poconos where it's -10c and snowing hard.|pg||
nt|swanson: N-S could afford to bid spades up to the 3-level, but they haven't found a way to enter the auction.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Welcome to the GC, 26c and we're all indoors playing bridge . :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.qldbridge.com/gcc/results.php  - results|pg||
pc|c2|nt|janm: 2@d had a very wide range here and East, with nice shape and a little extra in terms of values invited something higher - I think they'd better stop here though|pg||
nt|cindy: this will work out ok but i would bid 4H|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mariner1: hi Ally!|pg||
nt|forni: and we're back at Ohno vs Horwitz, which became an exciting match after two swings in favour of Ohno.|pg||

nt|sheila a: And N must have @dK for the opening bid, so all is well. Don't think that's the actual result|pg||
nt|daman: grand slam time|pg||
nt|joest: I believe the Zang team currently is  2 in the round robin while Curt-Lennart is languishing in the ninth spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not the best defence so likely only 1|pg||
nt|viren169: Nice hand for N/S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ralfwil: Is it usual to put on the highest from a sequence, when partner plays the suit. I normally play the lowest. Here @dJ from J10xx|pg||
nt|daman: in either of 3 suits :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: NS has nothing outside spades|pg||
nt|daman: can even make 7@H|pg||
nt|daman: for all of the matchpoints :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: interesting to see W's approach|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: 170 and 140 is also an imp: 5 or 4|pg||
nt|ady: think they might get overboard here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Quite hard to hold it to 7 tricks, I think|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 7@H is on|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|santyclz: 23 hcp grand.  Not too often you see them.|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|sheila a: That's a big han|pg||
nt|daman: this looks systemic|pg||
nt|joest: some peculiar actions ina standard structure|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@H seems a bit windy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as in wet?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: British weather|pg||
nt|joest: 1@c I understand; south's pass I don't|pg||
nt|joest: west seems strong for 1NT|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to reach though!|pg||
nt|daman: I wonder if they can get to the grand salami?|pg||
nt|viren169: all revolves around no wasted values in   clubs...|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@C now may solve that problem....|pg||
nt|daman: what would we bid over 1@H?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: thinking of catching up?|pg||
nt|santyclz: And the fact that all suits break doesn't hurt.|pg||
nt|daman: splinter with a void?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: need to see a cc to explain e-w system - 1C rather than 1D suggests that weak nt hands are opened 1C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion W should bid 1@d|pg||
nt|joest: mine too|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: still, he caught up|pg||
nt|henryb: seems to me it shows proper appreciation of the lack of value of quacks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and what will the mention by double be then?|pg||
nt|othered1: Only an overtrick is in play here|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: but even so, this is rather trappy bidding|pg||
nt|ady: only need club finesse and hearts behaving|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Too flat for my liking :)|pg||
nt|othered1: without @S lead, declarer should have 10 tricks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sheila a: Too many jacks?|pg||
nt|viren169: shame... with co|pg||
nt|viren169: controls in all 4 suits... 3@H is an underbid for me...|pg||
nt|daman: if they played exclusion BW   that would have worked    as it was  3@H was a huge underbid|pg||
pc|d6|nt|henryb: or a @s lead|pg||
nt|daman: South is getting indigestion right about now|pg||
nt|santyclz: Of course a light 1@h opening by s would have been helpful.|pg||
nt|viren169: very light!|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is 3@H invitational for any of you? It isn't for me. You have lots of other bids available for an invite|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, competitive|pg||
nt|ady: have to get diamonds soon|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no! |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Purely competing - looks as if North revalued his collection|pg||
nt|henryb: yes all those quacks suddenly became 6 high card points!|pg||
nt|henryb: (quacks are queens and jacks)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Manaca should know declarer has the singleton @SK|pg||
nt|ady: was  this the 2@C lead?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did partner not lead a spade? Because he doesn't have both top honours|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, and no tens.  A very average hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I se double as a try to find a major and also some kind of strength|pg||
pc|c3|nt|henryb: yes. a sensible person who does not play MUD|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H is 20+, any shape|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hope so|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: We think Hed-Andersson are N-S  because they play that system|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Berg-Ragnarsson don't|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6@C is not the world's worst contract|pg||
nt|joest: but with what people open these days, I'm not sure how South can avoid a 1NT overcall to keep from being stolen blind.  He did howver pick the right hand to pass :)|pg||
nt|daman: I would have passed the South hand|pg||
nt|viren169: me too...|pg||
pc|c7|nt|daman: seems to me 2@D followed by 3@D was a bit like a Walsh bid   showing both minors with longer @Ds|pg||
nt|daman: and a huge hand   3@S would have been a cuebid|pg||
nt|daman: as well  as 4@H|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes - @C2, 3rd & 5th|pg||
nt|ady: next a@D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: It cannot be difficult to see where the 4 tricks in defence will come from|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Could you get new names up operator please?|pg||
nt|stoffers: simular to viking-precision Roland?|pg||
nt|sheila a: The average Scottish club player would be in 3NT in 4 bids on these cards. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Click on North and insert Hed, then on South and insert Andersson|pg||
pc|d8|nt|viren169: it would have worked well here!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|odysseus69: 1NT looks like a super maximum but perhaps 1C is 11-12 and East downgraded|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@C - 2@D  - 3NT?  Only three bids perhaps|pg||
nt|santyclz: Does the boxing term featherweight apply in bridge?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|daman: 6@D is a bit strange      5NT would have shown that hand|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2 aces+void? 5 nt|pg||
nt|daman: shows a void with 2 key cards|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Kind of Stoffers, but they play a limited 8-11 1M opening|pg||
nt|sheila a: In the old days people would just open 3NT - 1 bid!|pg||
nt|mmmakela: maybe they switched the replyes |pg||
nt|ralfwil: That is also one of the weaknesses with strong @c|pg||
nt|daman: sure does|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bjacobs: Actually, quite recently, I was playing a 3NT opening as showing 25-26|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Better than gambling minor at least|pg||
nt|daman: and bantamweight|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: thx Liz|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bjacobs: indeed|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|stoffers: indeed|pg||
nt|joest: Stenstom squeezed in three suits there|pg||
nt|viren169: underweight!|pg||
nt|santyclz: I would open the s hand playing precision but not otherwise.|pg||
mc|12|pg||
qx|c2|st||md|4SAJ932HA964DKJ3C3,SK86HJ7D9862CAT52,SQHKT832DAQTCKQJ7,ST754HQ5D754C9864|sv|n|nt|janm: I take it back, Matheson is scoring 10 tricks and this should be a very good result|pg||
nt|swanson: Not a good effort by N-S.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peter Gill taking no chances with the @S finesse -- 5@C making 5 is nice score|pg||
nt|werge: In my world, North has two 5-cards suits...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: this is Open Pairs so we will not have scores shown......|pg||
nt|swanson: E-W will likely be off one in 2@S here.  Dangerour for SOuth to enter vulnerable with weak minor suits.|pg||
nt|mariner1: weak NT by E|pg||
nt|forni: really?|pg||
nt|forni: if North had 5-5, in my world he would've started off with 1@H|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: Yamada-Ohno have been playing together for 30+ years. In Beijing their team won the Senior Event|pg||
mb|p|nt|forni: so 6-5 is probable|pg||
mb|2H|nt|janm: West will probably transfer to spades... wrong again!|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: hi all    little bit of a late start|pg||
mb|4C|nt|marlowepi: with the void and the heart fit, i don;t think i could bid less than 3S with the W hand|pg||
nt|npcjpn: no hope for tenth:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: the distribution here helps the effort in 3@C|pg||
nt|werge: I meant, I will show the hand as 5-5!|pg||
mb|4N|nt|forni: ahh|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: @SA on side, @c 3 3 , @D 3 3 with Q@D in pocket|pg||
nt|swanson: I would have preferred to pass with the South hand with the plan of making a takeout double of hearts if E-W try to play at the two level.|pg||
nt|mariner1: the @H lead works for defense for taps|pg||
nt|janm: 2NT seems a pretty big position to take certainly|pg||
nt|mariner1:  http://www.qldbridge.com/gcc/           tournament site  -|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or else 2NT, followed by 3S (depending on agreements)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play a Weak NT and an uncommon 2@D opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we should be able to follow most of the other auctions|pg||
mb|5H|nt|cindy: N has the hand I like ot be able to bid a nonforcing 2H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after the jump to 4S, Pass by E would surely be forcing, so W should really pass here|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Bakkeren asking about the 2NT bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like lebbish|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Bakkeren in the tank|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so that is what it is|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: in the tank.....|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Bakkeren ...thinking|pg||
nt|sybarra: challenging hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: just in case S has some 6/4 red suited hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be in the tank also |pg||
nt|marlowepi: if W was asking about the 2NT bid, i would guess he was just stalling for time. it is pretty obvious what kind of hand N has|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: they play 2@c as a puppet to 2@d, usually a start of a sign-off, hence 2@d is Stayman.|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|nt|sybarra: who is a 5 @S bidder? |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|janm: How greedy should N be?|pg||
nt|santyclz: An inspired or foolish bid, depending on the result.|pg||
nt|mariner1: agreed, the VUL position vs NV might indicate prudence here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|swanson: The cards are lying quite well for N-S and declarer is forced to take advantage of it.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pass by E would have been forcing|pg||
nt|forni: well I have to agree with you on that one :)|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, i like playing that NF, but i would still pass 2D|pg||
nt|cindy: sometimes partner has the perfect hand where we can make 4H|pg||
nt|keylime: evening everyone|pg||
nt|cindy: hi|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello Cindy, Marshall and Dwayne|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with only 3HCP in my 2 suits and no spade spots, i would not be eager to advance the bidding. i doubt we are missing a game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi roland|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|sunsamvar: Hi and welcome to the 2nd segment of the seminfinal form the Gold Coast|pg||

pc|d3|nt|swanson: Well, maybe not.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|keylime: W-E if memory serves are playing Dutch Doubleton|pg||
nt|cindy: its rare but there are times when partner has nothing but the A in diamonds and its perfect|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we know that @C are 3-2 and @DK is onside, but Ohno will try not to rely upon the finesse|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: wonder what 3 sp would have been instead of 2?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|keylime: while N-S are using a weak NT, but unconfirmed about whether it's a strong club system or not|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but i would bid 5S on a different hand, with different bidding|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what isn;t rare is for partner to have 2263, with 2D our last makeable spot|pg||
nt|cindy: thats true|pg||
nt|keylime: especially with the lack of 1NT rebid as well|pg||
nt|cindy: but would you give up a chance for plus 620 when you might go down 100 ?|pg||
mc|11|nt|ahollan1: after using up dummy's entries though -- he may have no other choices thought|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe @D discard, @H then endplay West?|pg||
pg||

nt|cuttysark: That would be artistic!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "What's your 2NT opening" I asked|pg||
nt|stoffers: i much prefer the zia way to open 2NT for minors, Qx-Qx majors is a must :)|pg||
nt|othered1: That figures to win an imp or two for KNEP|pg||
nt|viren169: I think Karlsson will mentally put slam swing against in his mind!|pg||
nt|santyclz: A theorhetical question.  Should s play the hand to maximize tricks or to cater to a distribution in which 6@hs won't make?|pg||
nt|viren169: interesting question... I would go for the former!|pg||
mb|1N|an|13-15|nt|ralfwil: but perhaps 1 imp loss 9 or 10 tricks in @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 5@D  ok here     |pg||
nt|henryb: well below. 20% is less than 38%|pg||

mb|p|nt|stoffers: hehe, nice|pg||
nt|santyclz: In either case I doubt he went down 3. Oper please check that score.|pg||
nt|viren169: play the contract you are in rather than the one you would like to be in (or the one at the other table!)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Let me think about that one, Henry|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@D - 1N?|pg||
nt|joest: 2@s was alerted?|pg||

pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: 20 less than 38|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 @H par here?|pg||
nt|joest: I think South should bid 3@h which, as a passed hand, should be fit-showing (hearts and clubs)|pg||
nt|daman: S is in a quandry    shd pass and bid after?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|henryb: I would overcall 1@s because of the overwhelming suit quality|pg||

nt|mdgraham: agree|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Thank you Henry - did you compute the singletong @HQ?|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@H could have stolen EW's spot.|pg||
nt|daman: but East will not sit|pg||
nt|santyclz: N thinks he has a working singleton.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ralfwil: a superfit!|pg||
nt|joest: I think everyone is showing super human restraint here :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to Ralf Willquist|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hi all|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hej Ralf|pg||
nt|othered1: EW can make 2 or 3@H|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sheila a: But was their system perfect? :)|pg||
nt|viren169: like 5@H now for the lead... rather than 5@S|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|stoffers: will he get the @d right?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, they relayed lower with all the strong hands.  And they probably held Chris's views on using it to show a weak hand - too informative for the opponents|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bill, did you keep the system notes for later? If not, scroll back please, I am all over the place with 6 tables up|pg||
nt|joest: looks like this make right on time|pg||
nt|daman: what to do   what to do|pg||
pc|hT|nt|henryb: yes. picking up hearts is 52% and the club finesse is 50%.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: at least 10 tricks with crossruff|pg||
nt|odysseus69: these guys are certainly conservative|pg||
pc|h4|pc|cT|nt|bjacobs: ok, boss|pg||
nt|othered1: 6 off the top now.  Do you try for @S trick right away, at some risk|pg||
nt|viren169: nice pass for par result!|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|daman: I would have unsheathed the blade if I were east    does he really think he is bidding to make?|pg||
nt|viren169: Bd 14 result doesnt seem right?!?!|pg||
nt|daman: new operator|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ralfwil: cash 3 rounds of @h and crossruff|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not easy to reach game but after this start East might have risked 3 spades|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a finess in @s is needed to make the contract. N will play @d when in on @h A or K|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But he got help|pg||
pc|h7|nt|henryb: and the contract is not cold with 3-1 hearts and the club onside|pg||
pc|c4|nt|viren169: let's bring back the old one then!|pg||
nt|daman: shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mmmakela: was making anyway w spade fin: 4 discards|pg||
nt|daman: Hoi Ralf|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s5|nt|othered1: Perhaps the other J was played?|pg||
nt|viren169: only kidding!|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bjacobs: I was so caught up in my story - so N/S are playing Forcing Pass methods?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes|pg||
nt|viren169: we like the new operator!|pg||
nt|daman: he should claim down 1|pg||
nt|viren169: and we like all his friends and family...|pg||
nt|santyclz: And particularly his dog.|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ralfwil: with a so sharp hand (2 aces and a singleton) I agree|pg||
nt|odysseus69: prefer your suggestion Ralf|pg||
nt|sheila a: How much difference does that make? If you have weak 2 bids you'd open them anyway, I presume|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think best defence is to assume that he has 0-7 and bid accordingly. Your system is on|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You just cannot come in with a rubbish overcall at the 1 level ... which is what big clubbers don't like|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bjacobs: And they are playing a rather nasty form of it ... where Pass could be weak or strong|pg||
nt|Walddk4: pass 0-7 or 17+|pg||
nt|sheila a: Can we confirm that the previous two contracts did in fact make?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So over the pass you don't know whether to bid normally or interrupt their system|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thats the idea|pg||
nt|bjacobs: However, maybe the system is not as destructive as some ... for example 1@H and 1@S "ferts" (weak hands)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|cuttysark: When I was a gal West's overcal would improve the odds on the club finesse. Not now, though, I agree|pg||
nt|odysseus69: about play|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Meanwhile, E-W have bid to the top spot, well done|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|mc|5|pg||
qx|c3|st||md|1SAT2H96DJ743CAKJ5,S63HKQT85DA82C962,SJ75H7432DT6CQ873,SKQ984HAJDKQ95CT4|sv|e|nt|swanson: Losing the diamond finesse would be costly, but it is even worse to be taking a minus score when all the cards are favorable for your side.|pg||
nt|mariner1: off 1 might score some,,, not easy to see|pg||
nt|mariner1: very true John..........|pg||
nt|swanson: Two 10% results for N-S in my judgment.|pg||
nt|mariner1: when is an aggressive contract its usually best to try to make it.......|pg||
nt|nickf: Hi - we'll see North's daughter later on I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: when in|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, shirley, i was wondering too, since 2S seems like such an underbid|pg||
nt|sybarra: it didnt show the shape imo |pg||
nt|sybarra: but oh well,  |pg||
nt|sybarra: someone brought out the goulash dealer?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: checking conditions -- the semi-final will be 4-10 board segments|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@H here for E/W|pg||
mb|1N|an| |nt|werge: Another 5-6|pg||
nt|forni: yeap|pg||
nt|forni: and it'll become interesting what one would bid with S after 1@C|pg||
nt|forni: I'm very fond of bidding known 2-suiters|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: a spec suggested that W might have deliberately underbid, walking the dog. but S had shown his hand and N was marked with only a few points. so it easily could have gone all pass|pg||
mb|2D|an| |mb|2S|nt|werge: Here, North is the best to be declarer in 3 NT|pg||
nt|forni: so if I could bid 2@C or 3@C or 2NT or 3@D as @S+@D, I would surely do so.|pg||
nt|forni: But|pg||
nt|forni: I don't realise... my 1@C is forcing, and it's actually kinda normal that E would open a strong 2@C :P|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: p p p|pg||
nt|forni: now E has an interesting problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: N-S may get a little nudge here into game|pg||
nt|cindy: yes|pg||
nt|cindy: N wouldnt pass 3C anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: Fiona Brown, who came 4th in World Mixed Pairs a few years ago when just 22|pg||
nt|forni: yes blackwould would surely do, I always think too difficult|pg||
nt|forni: :S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: i would be very nervous of cidding just 3C with the S hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my methods, pass is strong inaction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now THAT is surprising -- I thought Yamada would double again|pg||
pc|c2|nt|swanson: THree boards per round I believe, then we get new players (at least different players).|pg||
nt|cindy: i bet he was starting to sweat a little|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|mariner1: Fiona was also an excellent Vugraph Operator during the Yeh Cup!|pg||
pc|cK|nt|swanson: This delayed raise by East generally is used to show a solid values for 2@H.|pg||
nt|keylime: 3@c seens a little conservative to me as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: letting the opponents play 2-level in 8 card fit tends to lose more than it gains|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: i suspect he was trying to walk the dog|pg||
pc|c7|nt|cindy: would you just forget the club suit and bid 4H ?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|swanson: With less, East is required to simply raise 1@H to 2@H and forget about spades.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|keylime: I would bid clubs, to cater to short hearts - with seven of them, and the side club suit, I want to clue pard in to my hand; I certainly will have probably one more bid|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|sunsamvar: Has to use the sparse entries to dummy wisely|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: and as we see 3@D is excellent contract|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: i would probably bid 4C ovber 2D|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|keylime: 4@c may have been a splinter tho hence the 3@c call|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|d9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the bad break will do declarer in.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: well, i would be bidding clubs for a different reason. i always want to play in hearts unless there is a 3-4 card disparity in N's suit lengths|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|marlowepi: yes, dwayne, no doubt u r right about 4C being a spolinter|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: probably better to use the only entry to take the @D fin|pg||
pc|sQ|mc|9|nt|swanson: South would have been better off to continue North's good idea of leading trumps.|pg||
pg||
qx|o4|st||md|2SAQJT9H93DKQ62CA6,S86HAQJT7D943CQJ4,S5H854DAJT75CK932,SK7432HK62D8CT875|sv|b|nt|mmmakela: phone brb|pg||
nt|daman: EW will probably land in 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: I think it might have made more sense to work the hearts for a diamond pitch but he could do anything on this layout|pg||
nt|viren169: says 6@C on the result?!?!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sheila a: I guess the defence didn't switch to @d?|pg||
nt|othered1: EW have partial in @S here, since @C suit is "frozen" for defense and @D can be set up for pitch|pg||
nt|othered1: that allows 3@S|pg||
nt|joest: this looks to be a quiet 1NT by north|pg||
nt|viren169: on the last|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oper, highlight bd 14 and type in 3hs+3|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and a push it was|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt best on W|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: good flat board, then|pg||
nt|daman: 4@H +2|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: part score hand if staying low|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Double would not be my choice|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In a natural system  1@c - 1@h 1@s - 2@s  - 3@h - 4@s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: so what is 1@D, Bill? (I forget)|pg||
nt|othered1: Lirarna did pick up a vul game swing on board 13 on what looks like a big @C auction there, without interference by east|pg||
nt|daman: looks like a 4@S game here for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: What is East going to do over a 1@H response?|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: put down dummy?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I see, 1NT, but that shows a much stronger hand in my book|pg||
nt|cuttysark: just shows opening strength over a club - I guess the alternative is Pass, but who does that?|pg||
nt|henryb: bid 1NT to show 18-20 balanced of course|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ralfwil: @d singleton to xxxx|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and this is not so risky David?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 8-11 (1D bal, 4441 or 4*major+longer minor. |pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t like 3@s on W. For me 2@s is better and accept an invitation|pg||
nt|joest: n-s are presumably playing a weak NT so that this rebid showed extras|pg||
nt|santyclz: Sorry 4hs+3|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@S looks a bit aggresive...|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mdgraham: West is taking it as that....|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If playing the method he should bid 1@S to show 4|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this is the same way that North bid a 4-3-3-3 13 count on board 1 - so still not clear about system|pg||
nt|bjacobs: )|pg||
nt|bjacobs: (Forgot to close the bracket :))|pg||
nt|viren169: worked well|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, he is taking him seriously, and should|pg||
pc|s5|nt|daman: I would have bid 2@H and not 3@S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: warning Mr. Jacobs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: "You can't be serious"|pg||
nt|joest: this is going to be touch and go|pg||
nt|joest: strongest would seem to duck the first club, win the second and play a spade, perhaps forcing them to do something good foryou|pg||
nt|viren169: I think a simple 2@D was in order there... and raise spades next time|pg||
nt|daman: 3@S should show a different hand|pg||
nt|viren169: I dont mind 2@H either!|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|othered1: Actually, east needs to work out the @D position in order to get the pitch.  Pulling two trumps and then exiting in @H awaiting help from opponents is a possibililty, but not clear|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Never sure with Roland ....|pg||
pc|sA|nt|henryb: I really hate off shape take out doubles|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@h = 4-cards @s|pg||
nt|daman: yes   puppet|pg||
nt|viren169: I think 3@S should show 4xxx shape with a card or two|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ralfwil: Strong @c|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: I would ask a kibitzer to table the cards rush to the bathroom|pg||
nt|daman: yes   more preemptive|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: South must remember to cover if @HJ is led from dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *and rush|pg||
nt|ady: between them they are bidding about 10 points more than they have    west's 3@H somewhat an exageration   already found a voluntary bid on first round|pg||
nt|daman: destined to make at least 9 tricks|pg||
nt|viren169: more pre-empt value|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bjacobs: Anyway, East has a plan for beating 1NT here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: or he should have|pg||
nt|ralfwil: On this hand you can see the advantage of weak nt. You can rebid 1nt  with confidence|pg||
pc|h5|pc|sK|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Unlikely game is making with both opponents bidding|pg||
pc|hK|nt|henryb: no David. Partner showed 18-20, so W forced and offered a choice of contract|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: there is a case for north's covering the @D 10, even though it might look foolish in some positions|pg||
nt|joest: note the power of north's five of clubs!|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but not on board 1?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|ralfwil: weak (less than 1nt) ot 17+|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or..|pg||
pc|hT|nt|joest: east-west can't break diamonds|pg||
nt|joest: profitably :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i am told that 1S is either 17-20 or what it was on board1 - balanced 11-13|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c3|nt|ralfwil: A @h finess is needed. After winning with @dQ a @s shift|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but is not so difficult after a @h discard from N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and no @c return|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W must have a complete count on N|pg||
pc|h2|nt|joest: he probably wants to hop to prevent an entry for another heart play|pg||
nt|joest: oon board two Curt-Lennart wandered into 3@s on their 4-3 and went down one, losing six imps to the 180 inthis room|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sT|pc|hJ|pc|d5|nt|ralfwil: @cJ?????|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cuttysark: South seems to believe in 3rd hand J from J10. Unusual approach|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: even with 18  game very doubtful with that poor heart suit   and I think many will bid 2NT with 19 or 20 whenpartner has made a bid that was not forced|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a@h is needed|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s7|pg||
pc|cT|mc|9|pg||
qx|c4|st||md|2SAQJT9H93DKQ62CA6,S86HAQJT7D943CQJ4,S5H854DAJT75CK932,SK7432HK62D8CT875|sv|b|nt|janm: Also if we were watching only the leaders that would give information to the players, unless this is a barometer and they know how they're doing|pg||
nt|nickf: Barometer|pg||
nt|swanson: N-S are on for game here but it will not be asy to bid.|pg||
nt|janm: Especially if West starts with 2@s|pg||
nt|mariner1: well with only 7 pairs we could have a Howell or similar|pg||
nt|nickf: the scorers hope to provide almost real time scores|pg||
nt|janm: So much for 2@s|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: bid out of term and accepted|pg||
nt|keylime: I'd be thrilled to have pard give me honor-doub of my first suit with South's hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this vulnerability  2@S-1 and 3@D=  get same score  so  NS right again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no surprise -- Gill's 5@C contract on board 1 is a game swing|pg||
nt|forni: I'd say that east has a hand good enough for a 18-19 rebid, thus opening 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: players are using bridgemates|pg||
nt|cindy: S has a dandy hand here   |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: aha!|pg||
nt|werge: To me, West has the hand for a directly 4 @S-bid|pg||
mb|1C|an| |nt|sybarra: 1 @D the "yucky" hand |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: N/S are playing weak NT |pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: Gill plays transfer openings in some partnerships, but I didn't think this was one of them|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: finally a game contract that has decent chances to make|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mariner1: make that 14 pairs 7 tables|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 2@h is a limit for NS with careful defence.|pg||
nt|werge: But better let E/W play here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|marlowepi: at first glance it may look like S  should rebid 4H, then bid 5C over 4S. but that does not have to be a suit--it could even be a void. so S wanted to bid clubs at his second turn. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: odd for a 7-5 hand to be awkward to bid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3nt ofcourse depends on locating the @Cq|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugrapha3: sorry :)|pg||
nt|forni: I can agree with that|pg||
nt|forni: And even though East has a great hand if West would've bid 4@S directly, he doesn't nearly have enough aces to continue over 4@S|pg||
nt|werge: The danger is, that North - after 1 @S - can bid a leas-directing suit|pg||
nt|werge: lead-directing|pg||
nt|forni: N can bid a lead-directing suit for if W becomes declarer?|pg||
nt|werge: East MUST have showed the hand allready|pg||
nt|forni: The trouble for Peake now is: Why can't west have AKxxxx, Jxx, xx, Axx|pg||
nt|werge: OK, sleepy...|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: in the last set  they doubled 1D and meant it for takeout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this makes 5 of either minor - but only because of lucky @C position|pg||
nt|forni: that's why 4@S over 1@C is better.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|cindy: this time apparently it means diamonds|pg||
nt|npcjpn: sure.|pg||
nt|werge: 7 easy tricks against 3 @C|pg||
nt|werge: - but East might be declarer in three other suits|pg||
nt|forni: plus NS could find their 5-red save.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: kokish i guess|pg||
nt|keylime: valid point Marshall - |pg||
nt|keylime: looks like it doesn't it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: judging by the N bidding, it still means takeout|pg||
mb|4D|nt|swanson: Seems like a losing system to not be able to get that spade suit of Wes't in the auction immediately.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H over 1@S is interesting to me..... not passing to try penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: Kokish for those that don't know is 2@c-2@d-2@h, where hearts are either natural, or showing a specific range of balanced hand|pg||
nt|cindy: kokish makes these big balanced hands easier to bid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the @d overcall and support have steered them to 4@H|pg||
mb|5D|nt|janm: Interesting decision for South when East opened out of turn - I wonder if he'd have done better to have the bidding revert to West|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: I think it was a slip of attention for both|pg||
nt|keylime: hence the forced 2@s call.|pg||
nt|werge: Did´nt West bid his hand twice (at least..)|pg||
nt|werge: This will be 5 @S probably one down - @d- to the ace and misguessing the @C-suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: hi zh |pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: yes  it was N last time that doubled for takeout and S thought it was diamonds|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry privie|pg||
nt|cindy: they didnt discuss apparently|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since i'm the only commentator -- if there are things you'd like me to cover rather than random raving -- just send me a chat message|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: didnt matter here since N chose to not Stayman|pg||
nt|keylime: named after the brilliant Canadian theorist, Eric Kokish.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is 2S 100% forced, then? i'm thinking it's better if N can bid 3H with spades, to get the play in the S hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: either before or after the misundersatnding|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Ohno beat the Hackett team (MELBOURNE - DE LIVERA - HIRST - HACKETT - BAKKEREN - BERTENS) this morning in a 24 board match  to make the semi finals |pg||
pc|hK|nt|cindy: 8 card fit and lots of hcp but slam would be very difficult|pg||
nt|cindy: 2S is forced in kokish|pg||
nt|keylime: normally when i got to play Kokish it was almost 100% forced, unless I had a single suiter or certain 2 suiters.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe Yamada needed to raise to 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that would probably only make the auction less convincing|pg||
nt|npcjpn: south's first pass was a surprise.|pg||
nt|forni: that's not impossible :)|pg||
nt|werge: With thusd dummy, North can´t play others than a @C NOW|pg||
nt|forni: remember I called that 4@D with north's "5-5" in the red suits not the right contract? Other table decided to bid up to 5@D, winning 5 imps for Ohno.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|davidstern: This event started with 246 teams. Six survived after 10 rounds of 10 boards. Top 2 to the semi-finals and the remaining four playing off for the other two spots|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|cindy: wouldnt it sort of defeat the purpose if 2S not forced ?|pg||
nt|keylime: open room is about to start on board 1, so we're going to have comparisons soon.|pg||
nt|werge: He smelled the misfit|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|swanson: The problem with trying for a penalty is that N-S surely have a minor suit fit and might be able to take a lot of tricks there - as they can here.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|davidstern: Lavazza Red Bocchi/Madala/Sementa/Duboi finished 7th|pg||

nt|werge: I think we have a problem here - for how long can North wait before smitching to the obvious @c?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|santyclz: Might have done better to lead another trump.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|davidstern: Temperature is 32C or 91F outside and very pleasant|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am surprised he ruffed with low club|pg||
pc|c2|nt|keylime: certain hands like, both minors, can be hard over a strong 2@c hand|pg||
nt|keylime: hard to bid I meant|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no, i don;t think so. it ought to be possible to arrange alternative structure so that N & S can rveeal their hands while still allowing S to be declarer|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: i don't think it would matter|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: he isn;lt going to cross to dummy with the 9, he is going to ruff cards in dummy|pg||
nt|npcjpn: yes, still, may have a game, though pass worked weil.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|werge: OK - try for the @H Queen-drop - or guess the @C-suit. Good luck|pg||
pc|cK|nt|davidstern: The four playing off here are Japanese Senior, Giura Melbourne, McGann|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c3|nt|werge: But how strong might East be passing over 1 H?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|forni: But australia takes back a swing on board 12 by bidding 3NT, which will be made|pg||
pc|dK|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|vugrapha3: Gill not happy with his spade switch... shaking his head|pg||
pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: W hasn;t worked out that they had a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he was expecting H ace in S|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|cindy: another advantage of kokish is being able to open 2C on two suited hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: responder would normally bid 2S, but with 4+ spades would do something else|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|d5|pc|s7|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: a heart to the 9 on the first round would have made the hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: as you said,  he expected @H ace in S |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Ohno scored 8 on 14|pg||
nt|keylime: hi again|pg||
nt|cindy: hi|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|s9|pc|hJ|pc|d7|nt|forni: but you are right, he'll have to decide in @C... you say wrong?|pg||

nt|odysseus69: unusual - 4 boards and no contract beyond 2 level and no competitive auctions|pg||
nt|odysseus69: might get a little action here|pg||
nt|stoffers: lol, tough to predict things here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like a 4@h on E|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If the Q was played he would have covered and then - why not the 10?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: and I don't need to jump to 2N because I never have the sort of takeout double East had.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yeah, this is not the set for predictions |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Looks like 5@d on S. W cannot attack @h|pg||
nt|joest: can n-s reach five diamonds?   needs a heart lead to beat it|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: that double looks odd|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not on @s!|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ralfwil: With that @d support I had introduced my @s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cards friendly for spade contract|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not on S! I cannot spell....|pg||
nt|joest: was the 2@s overcall alerted?|pg||
nt|daman: partscore time|pg||
nt|viren169: be interesting how N/S cope with this hand...|pg||
nt|viren169: 1N by West?|pg||
nt|daman: N has a good Flannery hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: However that doesn't seem to be their system, to use it as preemptive and while I agree with the preemption theory it's pretty obvious they're not playing it.|pg||
nt|daman: yes 1NT would be the standard bid    11-14|pg||
nt|viren169: You dont need a stop in protective seat...|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mdgraham: or didn't have, in a manner of speaking|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That 7 down on board 13 ... you know I would have only predicted 6 down, and I would have been wrong again|pg||
nt|daman: hard to stop below game|pg||
nt|viren169: some specs saying no 1NT without a stop...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: no|pg||
mb|3N|nt|stoffers: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Then east has A98x and you've looked silly|pg||
nt|ralfwil: overbid from both hands?|pg||
nt|daman: you bid your hand    would be nice to have a stopper nut sometimes you aren't dealt one|pg||
nt|daman: but*|pg||
nt|viren169: Perhaps a dble by South would have worked well...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@C?|pg||
nt|henryb: for example, with this East hand I would want my partner to bid 1@h after 1@c-X-1@d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would have bid a natural 2@S over 1@S. Am I alone?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: yes, but do you agree with 2@s?|pg||
nt|joest: I would make a t/o double of 3@c with the south hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: no|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree!|pg||
nt|joest: n-s have sold out way too cheaply|pg||
nt|santyclz: "A stopper is as good as it sounds."|pg||
nt|daman: double by South is not on the radar|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: sorry, miscounted the North hand.|pg||
nt|henryb: me too. and I would have raised 2@c to 3 with South|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5@C makes unless East leads a heart?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but South should raise to 3@C, as an obstructive measure|pg||
nt|viren169: max pass...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bjacobs: They seem to have a thin but making game here|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|sheila a: Looks like the @c ruff will hold it|pg||
pc|c4|nt|odysseus69: spade guess needed for this and 4 spades- liable to get it right |pg||
nt|daman: now a trump|pg||
pc|c2|nt|joest: thismight work out if they are +50 here vs 5@d going down in the other room|pg||
nt|santyclz: I forget who said that.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: ad then North might try 3@D....and they might get there|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The defence can't get their diamond trick, though|pg||
nt|sheila a: Right|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yeahhhh, we got the player names up now|pg||
nt|stoffers: should have taken it with the J to play a spade up|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South was facing 8-11 balanced.  It was reasonable to say No to the try|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @h10 was a nice card to see|pg||
nt|daman: @S 3-3 is helpful too|pg||
nt|mmmakela: OR didn't even bid 6 on the grand hand|pg||
nt|daman: amazing|pg||
nt|daman: always happens that way|pg||
nt|othered1: Unless east is way short of high cards promised, west may have overevaluated the minor honors.|pg||
nt|daman: starkist|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... bid it with confidence and hope!|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: If W knows that E can be soo weak, it´s an overbid and E is too weak for opening showing majors|pg||
nt|joest: this cannot be a doubleton or east wouldhave four hearts and bid them|pg||
nt|viren169: You just said it!|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
nt|joest: it's now or never for the spade ruff|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: but that's a lot of mights|pg||
pc|h7|nt|odysseus69: luckily the diamonds break- should have won diamond in hand|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: discard a @h|pg||
nt|othered1: West's action has been pretty consistent with his team's -- when only one team has bid ((and usually made) game, it's been LIrarna.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|cT|nt|othered1: And the score reflects that|pg||
nt|daman: Edgar Kaplan I believe|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sA|nt|othered1: Here, at least, west is paying out only 50's for his fun.|pg||

mb|p|nt|werge: This time, E/W can bid a lot more - and make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: only part scores here it seems|pg||
nt|cindy: many players dont like to open 2C on two suiters but with kokish you can show two suits (if one of the suits is spades) easily|pg||
nt|keylime: W-E use a 14+ t 17 NT according to the convention card I have for them:|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome back cindy and dwayne|pg||
mb|1D|an| |nt|mariner1: hi Joe|pg||
nt|keylime: http://www.bridge.dk/landskamp03/cc/bertens-bakkeren.pdf|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you mean, if the opps don;t crowd you. but that is the reason why players don;t like to open 2C with 2-suiters in the first place|pg||
mb|2C|nt|cindy: yes i know|pg||
nt|keylime: I had to go retrieve a guest downstairs :-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Horwitz wants to bid -- but  nothing available|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: There is a very heated director call in the other match so players finding it had to concentrate|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|sybarra: and he/she survived|pg||
nt|werge: Here only the bidding has interest|pg||
nt|npcjpn: twelve tricks.|pg||
nt|werge: - 6 @c being ice-cold|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|keylime: she survived the 25 story ride in a really cramped elevator thankfully :-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Most experts around here respond with the South hand.  There is minimal playing strength but passing mades life so easy for the opponents.|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 2NT seems like a lot to bid on that hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: i wouldnt bid with S hand |pg||
nt|cindy: too dangerous for me|pg||
nt|sybarra: was just going to make same comment |pg||
nt|marlowepi: but this is cold on the intrafinesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: seemed really optimistic|pg||
nt|npcjpn: but it may not so easy, 3@c does not promise a solid suit.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mariner1: 2N will not fare well here ,,,,, to much out and off|pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart king, then D to the 9|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - my firt name is Hans|pg||
pc|h4|nt|keylime: I have nightmares of -500 in a partial with South's hand|pg||
nt|cindy: or 800 :)|pg||
nt|keylime: at least they are 5-5 and not a frisky 5-4 as some would have|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would bid. |pg||
pc|hT|nt|keylime: 2nt is pushing a bit with the weak diamond suit|pg||
nt|mrdct: this could be a good result horwitz - NS can makea few @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this won't be as easy as the @C games|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|swanson: If you Google Yeh 2009 you can find the site for the tournament.|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.yehcup09.com.au/  - Tournament site|pg||
nt|keylime: I think to be fair, it depends on the NT defense|pg||
nt|keylime: if you're a DONT user - 2@d fits the bill |pg||
nt|npcjpn: so depends on a lead.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|werge: Difficult to find the @s-lead|pg||
nt|npcjpn: bravo!|pg||
nt|werge: Voila - as the say in France|pg||
pc|c2|nt|swanson: Declarer might will guess diamonds - after all SOuth did pass 1@H.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome Dave!|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|swanson: well|pg||
nt|mariner1: that is the Yeh Cup site|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you could have a game opposite very little. and when you have this shape it is unlikely they will double before bidding something|pg||
nt|cindy: i wouldnt bid no matter what|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|cindy: partner is passed hand and we are red|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mariner1:  http://www.qldbridge.com/gcc/           - Tournament Site|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club ace , club and N is down|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes the @S switch on the previous bd allowed the game to keep|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c3|nt|swanson: The @D8 discard will chinch it.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: do we know what the problem is Fiona ?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|keylime: I'm swayed by what pard does admittedly. I'm use to opening light in my regular p'ship; his pass probably sways me here instead of me tabling 2@d (which is diamonds and hearts for ...|pg||
nt|keylime: us)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c7|nt|sunsamvar: the interesting boards are coming up. so hold on to the edge of your seats|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s8|pg||
nt|swanson: So 5 diamonds and one in each of the other suits for declarer.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it seems very anti-percentage to start with the ace of diamonds|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: the very fact that you are vul means that partner's top end is higher. here you would be a favorite to make game oppsite Qxxxx of hearts|pg||
nt|npcjpn: but North has to find six discard....|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|santyclz: He pitched a @d from dummy.|pg||
nt|janm: Still looks as if this is going down (only 4 diamonds, since declarer pitched one on a heart)|pg||
nt|cindy: all of my partners open anything that moves so we might miss a part score but thats ok with me|pg||
nt|sybarra: and home now |pg||
mc|8|nt|marlowepi: E opened the bidding, so it can;t be wrong to start with a D to the 9 and see what happens|pg||

nt|bjacobs: So Roland, we were completely wrong to correct the operator last set?  He WAS alerting the passes |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Indeed, apologies|pg||
nt|daman: why did he claim down 1?|pg||
nt|daman: has 3 losers|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ??|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a cheap save...|pg||
nt|joest: we'll see how high they get in the open room :)|pg||
nt|daman: we remind the specs that the score is wrong due to an input error on Board 14|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ralfwil: he went down????|pg||
nt|joest: but I'm not sure I'd be comfortable entering only +50 on my private score|pg||
nt|daman: so take 12 away from Zang and you have the corect score|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: urk|pg||
nt|cuttysark: You need a solid suit for a weak 2...|pg||
nt|henryb: suit quality!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now there's a suit where you have to travel a long way before it becomes solid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can they reach small slam?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Andersson is a magician. He made 12 tricks on 17!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: (he did not)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But it's not so easy with that claim button|pg||
nt|daman: operator...is that the correct result?|pg||
nt|daman: the old 4 card major system|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2D|nt|ralfwil: As the cards lies 13 tricks in @s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 1NT = 12-14|pg||
nt|daman: I like 1NT|pg||
nt|viren169: That will keep E/W out of the hearts!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I guess 3@H shows a minimum?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: D! ????|pg||
nt|daman: N will probably lead a @S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|odysseus69: perfect fit- difficult for West to move|pg||
nt|daman: doink|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... seems normal|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bjacobs: 2NT must be minors.  A bit questionable, but there you go|pg||
nt|ralfwil: saved by the bell!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: I'd prefer to be 5-5|pg||
nt|daman: has at least 7 tricks|pg||
nt|santyclz: Of course we would all have led a @c, but seriously folks...|pg||
nt|viren169: Lead is 2nd highest from bad suits|pg||
nt|viren169: Do we still agree with 8 from 987xx?|pg||
nt|viren169: if not what would you lead?|pg||
nt|viren169: Any comments whilst we wait?|pg||
nt|viren169: Comments from specs welcomed?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|othered1: I'm told "everyone" now plays that double for takeout.  Everyone but me and my partners, I'd guess.|pg||
nt|daman: yes    a @C stands out|pg||
nt|viren169: at least 8 tricks|pg||
nt|daman: operator    West did not duck the Spade|pg||
nt|santyclz: Undo please oper.|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: now cold|pg||
nt|ady: can ruff 2 clubs and play for hearts 3-2|pg||
nt|henryb: I think it might have been cold on any lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think so - a club lead forces your line, on this lead there are alternatives|pg||
nt|sheila a: This wil be hard work for declarer, especially on that lead|pg||
nt|othered1: Why you'd want to bid again, takeout or otherwise, is another question.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Geoffrey Wolfarth|pg||

nt|daman: sure|pg||
nt|daman: grand salami|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|odysseus69: more chance with slower approach- maybe playing drury would give them a chance|pg||
nt|sheila a: I think N should have played a third @h to force declarer|pg||
nt|othered1: Perhaps north implied some cards by passing 1N, then south's double for takeout would feel better to me.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: On a board like this, it´s importanr do que the @sK|pg||
nt|mmmakela: where did it go wrong?|pg||
nt|joest: killing the entry for the late pitch on the diamond|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: they didn´t realize they had a @s fit|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s2|nt|cuttysark: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/league/division.php?action=view&id=1865  for standing after round 6 of 9|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ady: big swing|pg||
nt|mmmakela: why not 4 @S instead of 4 NT?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ralfwil: In my opinion W must bid 5@h also showing first controls in minors and E can upgrade with @cK and the goos @s support|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c3|nt|roswolf: this is not a healthy choice for declarer|pg||

nt|marlowepi: and while we are speaking of the colors, E has opened a NT at favorable, which could be anything, especially for a dutch pair|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still - as Dave said, this could be good against NS @S partscore|pg||
mb|1S|nt|swanson: North will be under the miguided assumption that this deal belongs to his side.|pg||

nt|keylime: very true Marshall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm a 2@D bidder -- how about you Dave?|pg||
nt|mrdct: the @S suit likely to prevail here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@H has play here EW...... no Save NS|pg||
mb|1N|an| |nt|marlowepi: which means, i think, that the odds on bidding are nowhere near as terrifying as has been suggested|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lol   i thought they were in 3NT. to me it looks so automatic for N to bid 3NT over 2NT that i didnt even bother to check the rest of the auction|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: not sure what problem is :) In the Cayne match|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: micheals. most use micheals for weak(below opening hand) or 16 + hands.|pg||
nt|forni: looks like 4@S by NS|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mrdct: not a great @D suit but there are 6 of them so 2@D looks OK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when able to make overcall in suit just under opening bid -- because of preemptive value, it can be weaker than other 2 level overcalls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S a practical bid -- with EW showing 8+@S partner strong favorite to have some @S length|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think gill needs to bid again with this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  EW 8+@H -- but you knew that|pg||
nt|werge: If thisd is a weak-two - this beats the world record|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: terrifying for me   i would bid if that outside stuff were in my long suits|pg||
nt|mrdct: even though he is red vs green|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the north hand falls in between and most wd call the suits in turn|pg||
nt|forni: but|pg||
nt|werge: Here 4 @S is making N/S with only 16 HCP|pg||
nt|forni: I'm wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: I'd like the K@c in my diamonds. Then I'm bidding freely.|pg||
nt|forni: 3 rounds of @H will promote @SJ|pg||
mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: moreover, bidding VASTLY increases the chances that PARTNER will get to be on lead, which is a very good thing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would he still bid 2D if he had 250 honors?|pg||
nt|sybarra: should we pour you another glass of wine?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, pleaseeeeeeeeeeeee|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: how many votes for 3nt and how many for 4@H with the south hand ?|pg||
nt|werge: Yes, 3 rounds of H ist the killing defence - when East ruffs with the @S Jack|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: interesting -- when i began reading books/magazines from England "green" meant favorable vulnerability|pg||
nt|mrdct: trump lead by gill might be best - althogh he has a slight problem in that department|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  not-vul vs vu|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now that i know of other parts of the world - they use it "green" = not-vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: was 2H forcing by N ?|pg||
nt|keylime: I have a glass of Lake Anna Sunset currently in hand|pg||
nt|npcjpn: probably with 2@d multi, 2@h shows sound weak two. |pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: EW will probably think that N was kidding with the 1NT bid|pg||
nt|keylime: but I wonder if they are playing IJO's|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: not liking 3H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what did S think 2D was? if she couldn;t open the bidding surely she couldn;t bid 3H on a misfit, so she must have thought 2D was something else|pg||
nt|cindy: im happy defending |pg||
pc|s7|nt|mariner1: 5@C DBL would have been 500 however N has to much defense to save|pg||
nt|mrdct: north might put the @HJ on the tbale now|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 053|pg||
nt|npcjpn: sorry, private.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 3@c promises some values with 2NT lebensohl.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|keylime: 5@d looks to be a decent spot here|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|swanson: Unsupported aces are not often good leads, but here there is a reasonable chance that either the king is in dummy or that North can give partner a ruff.|pg||
nt|santyclz: @c continuation makes this very tough if possible at all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H before touching trump to ensure 2 or 3 ruffs in dummy|pg||
nt|werge: 3 NT and 5 @C both should make|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mrdct: west probably not keen on playing a trump from Qxx now|pg||
nt|mrdct: all very much looking like an easy make now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now play is just for overtrick|pg||
pc|d5|nt|keylime: pushes as expected on boards 1 and 2 hence the no score.|pg||
nt|sybarra: esp. when I know what to lead |pg||
nt|ahollan1: mid @S looks automatic -- if Gill follows suit, no harm|pg||
nt|forni: Ohno will take the lead by ending in 4@S on board 14, where Gill went down one in 5@S|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: some music started playing outside so play stopped :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: diamonds are forever :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|cindy: 3/2 diamonds makes it easy|pg||
pc|d6|nt|keylime: I asked Larry, who's my regular pard about the 5-5 red hand, he states he's coming in due to decent loser count. Ironically, he's more conservative than I am most of the time. :-)|pg||
nt|cindy: would anyone lead the K of hearts with W hand ?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mariner1: now a @c and defense prevails|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if nobody is dancing -- it doesn't count|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: keep the dangerous east out|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sunsamvar: once the @S king was seen with east he can be sure that the @C top honours are with west..|pg||
pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: S buys a dummy for 3H that is about two tricks better than par on this auction|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so good safety play|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|keylime: B3: 4@h got doubled and racked for 690|pg||
nt|cindy: yep|pg||
nt|keylime: I wonder if North was catering to South's somewhat yo-yo tendencies|pg||
nt|marlowepi: oy-oy tendencies?|pg||
nt|cindy: :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: i dont think yamada has the timing for a trump coup here|pg||

nt|mrdct: one entry short|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|mariner1: good defense will score here|pg||
nt|swanson: THe opening bid and raise by East was somewhere in the 'weak' to 'pitiful' category so he should be surprised to be taking a minus score.|pg||
nt|swanson: should not be|pg||
nt|mariner1: we move again now........ 3 board rounds|pg||
nt|nickf: I suppose EW will move to NS here|pg||
nt|mariner1: so it looks like our EW become NS each round|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|sheila a: So this hand is too strong for 1@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Yes, that would be 8-11|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Did 4@S go 3 down on 17?|pg||
nt|joest: in the meantime Ralf they sold to 3@c on the prior board in the open room too but didn't beat it!|pg||

nt|bjacobs: We do ...|pg||
nt|sheila a: Yes, it's a thrilling strong pass method|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: NS play Pass= 0-7 or 17+, 1C 12-16 any, 1NT 12-14. Other bid in first or second position 8-11 (1D bal, 4441 or 4*major+longer minor. 1H/S 5+Major, 2C/D 5+ minor no major and 2 H 55 ...|pg||

nt|sheila a: I wonder if W thought 2@c was forcing?|pg||
nt|joest: a perfect fitter that is cold for 6NT|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bjacobs: E/W have missed their 25 point 3NT, but they will have the last laugh|pg||
nt|roswolf: in unusual system bidding i play cuebids of opps real suit are the only forcing sequences|pg||
nt|bjacobs: makes sense|pg||
pc|c3|nt|viren169: nice play from East on this hand... not so nice if pd has 6 clubs!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Or kjxxx for that matter.|pg||
nt|viren169: It is West that should duck the 2nd club....|pg||

pc|hA|nt|cuttysark: Looks normal|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East might have bid over the 1@S overcall |pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: looks like down 1|pg||
nt|sheila a: Is there a case for W doubling the initial 1@c to show a weak balanced hand?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: certainly worth a thought|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c2|nt|ralfwil: 6@s must be the final contract. N knows nothing about @cKJ|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: You need time to prepare a proper defence of course, but they had. System cards submitted well in advance|pg||
nt|bjacobs: although since 1@C is legitimate in strength, if not shape, perhaps it's worth just treating it like a "short club"|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Too late. Pretty irrelevant in light of the result from the CR - good effort, 3NT after the spade overcall|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good bid - partner has values plus a spade stop, and you have seven tricks  |pg||
nt|henryb: the defense might have been sharper in the other room|pg||

nt|ahollan1: yep - trying to reduce trump to equal West's length|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugrapha3: yes|pg||

nt|ahollan1: both 5@C contracts have picked up double digit swings|pg||
mb|d|nt|npcjpn: in the open room, 6NT was made, so new leader.|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|keylime: important for South to not overly press due to the potential 10 imp loss|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 2 @h forcing and nat ?|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrdct: possible tricky @S contract for EW here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: micheals again|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: Americans partying cause summer in OZ|pg||
nt|mrdct: right-sided now|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: major suit battle developing here|pg||
nt|npcjpn: after a @H lead from South.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S guarantees 4-card support  [DBL=3@S]|pg||
nt|mrdct: i was up there for the Yeh Cup and can certainly attest to the fact that the Amercian bridge players know how to party|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: both 4  @H and 4@S makes although there are only 18 total tricks as per the LAW|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Weak NT and 3NT on the strength of the good diamond suit|pg||
nt|swanson: This will work out very well for N-S.  Unlucky for East to not be able to enter the auction.|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to guess to cash @D to make this|pg||
nt|mariner1: interestingly any card from dummy works here|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: very deep position to play E for 4 diamonds, which was obviously the plan from the getgo. it is not as if W bid 3S. anyway if she was thinking about that deep play, maybe she ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: should cash heart ace first just in case something interesting happens. when king falls, she can cash other top trump then ruff spade|pg||
nt|keylime: I think once the K@h falls under the ace, 4-1 trumps becomes more unlikely|pg||
nt|forni: hrm... this isn't the right contract.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|janm: Assuming S goes right in diamonds, which seems likely, this will be a great result for NS - not only bidding & making 3NT but an overtrick because of the lead|pg||
nt|swanson: Not finessing has the disadvantage of losing the remainder of the daimond tricks should Qxx be onside - but after the opponents run clubs there woudln't be many diamond tricks to ...|pg||
nt|swanson: take anyway.|pg||
nt|sybarra: how do "we"  (e/w) land in clubs?|pg||
nt|keylime: I think the club suit's been lost for 20 years Shirley...or more|pg||
nt|sybarra: or do they need to |pg||
nt|cindy: not by bidding 2S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think they better stay where they are|pg||
nt|cindy: i cant relate|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Bakkeren in the tank again|pg||
nt|sybarra: had several suggestion, of X with E  IF  east is going to bid|pg||
nt|npcjpn: after a strength showing redouble, direct 2@h shows (sub)-minimum opening.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: tough situation for Ish.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cindy: dont understand the tank either|pg||
nt|sybarra: tank=thinking|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@S looks quite managable - but with some skillful play 4@S is a chance here despite the 4-1 break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: selling out when opp known to hold 8@S may convince Gill that trump are 41|pg||
pc|h7|nt|keylime: I don't think you can cash two clubs tho after the K@h falls|pg||
nt|mrdct: "skillful" in this case means picking where the @SQ is|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|keylime: to get some information about how trumps might be breaking|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably this is rock-bottom for the 2NT range|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double with only one defensive trick understandably did not appeal to E|pg||
nt|cindy: i know   what could he be thinking about|pg||
nt|sybarra: what in the "h!@@@@  |pg||
nt|sybarra: pard has|pg||
nt|sybarra: to be bidding|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @C LEAD|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: otherwise it makes i think|pg||
nt|forni: "normally", s would open 1@C and N would bid 1NT over west's overcall.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mariner1: over tricks really count in MP however they don't hurt in Imps Across the Field either|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, he was thinking about NT. he does have an opening hand with a fit and  3 stoppers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL + pass of 2@S must put Q in North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- "must" is a 4-letter word|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: " twenty minutes left"|pg||
pc|s2|nt|werge: West shall false-card with the @h 9 - South might finesse East for the Jack|pg||
nt|forni: "the end"|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|cindy: his partner couldnt bid over 1N|pg||
nt|keylime: I'm surprised that a double didn't come flying out from West here|pg||
nt|mrdct: he probably wont try to set up @C before drawing trumps given that he's only in 2@S|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h4|nt|keylime: pard balanced red on white|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: I think W just happy to be defending |pg||
nt|cindy: my head is spinning|pg||
pc|h8|nt|marlowepi: u need an exorcist|pg||
nt|sybarra: you are right on that Dwayne|pg||
nt|sybarra: but knowing the dutch as I do, they balance on air,  so that is why W in the tank no doubt|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|keylime: declarer doesn't know about the friendly spade layout either|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it would seem more promising to lead a low diamond at trick 2|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|janm: Oops|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh well|pg||
nt|keylime: I think West has to smack the 3@h counterbalance here to teach a lesson|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well there is a block in @D|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W should have ducked that D trick|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: who knows, maybe declarer will return to hand & play another D|pg||

nt|npcjpn: hi, everyone.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: east must take @Dk and shift to @C w/o cashing the spade|pg||
nt|werge: Very important, that West keeps the communication open - otherwise, South might win by dropping the @H Q|pg||
pc|d7|nt|werge: Please change the two 2´s...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: NS are not vul, and N bid 3H voluntarily, not under pressure. yes, E did bid vul, but not immediately, and also he did NOT balance with double. meanwhile W has the WORST shape to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: have when you have a trump stack, and a huge proportion of the time when you reveal the locus of the trump stack it costs you a trick. i can understand the pass by W|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: where else could W be hoping to get a setting trick from?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: crunch time|pg||
nt|werge: by East|pg||
pc|d5|nt|npcjpn: this NS pairs have been central of bridge of Japan.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mariner1: kibber reminding me what Aunt Mattie says|pg||

pc|dA|nt|forni: trouble now.|pg||

nt|roswolf: wheels go round|pg||
nt|ralfwil: game in @s or @h. Which do you prefer?|pg||
nt|joest: so 4@h was permitted to make on board 6|pg||
nt|joest: but n-s has a good result on board 7|pg||
nt|viren169: Well done N/S!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: if no dias lead spades better|pg||
nt|daman: NS will slither into 4@S and make it on the @H finesse|pg||
mb|1C|nt|othered1: South has lots of honors, few honor tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The highest contract looks like 3@d|pg||
nt|othered1: would 2N be natural?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: 2 black tricks for e/w  in heart contract|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They opened 3@H in the other room - revolting but effective :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Víctor, but AQ10xx is better than A98xx|pg||
nt|mmmakela: mixed raise maybe|pg||
nt|joest: these guys play SUPER SOUND weak twos or maybe so-called "Roth" twos|pg||
nt|viren169: Nice 5@C sac by West though!|pg||
nt|viren169: unluck to go down 1|pg||
nt|santyclz: To show my age, I wouldn't open n with a weak 2.  4 cards in other major, void.  Either I might tolerate but not both.|pg||
nt|viren169: Me neither...|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|sheila a: System experimentation is all part of the fun|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: n/s also likely to be pushed to 5@H    |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, they win via unfamiliarity, but if you restrict them too much, then you are not resolving the problem of unfamiliarity|pg||
nt|othered1: It would be nice to bid a voluntary, but very limited 3@D|pg||
nt|joest: 2NT = lebensohl; a weak hand getting ready to sign off in 3@d|pg||
nt|viren169: Now id 2N lebensohl here or minors?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: maybe not, now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: It´s easier to show these suits if opps interfear|pg||
nt|daman: 3@D was a form of Bergen|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mmmakela: ok 11 and next|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree. I once played against a pair who held 4-5 to 6-3 in majors The 10-card @s was never mentioned and 4@h  -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: It's a paradox, of sorts|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Yes, too many restrictions kill bridge. You can't get new youngsters to the game if you impose restrictions. "Welcome guys, but you can't play this and that". That's no fun for ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: them|pg||
nt|viren169: Now E/W will sac over 4@S|pg||
nt|daman: South might pass|pg||
nt|daman: 4333 13 count|pg||
nt|santyclz: Would you really bid 4@s with s over a weak 2?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: This should be worth a couple of hundred to NS, a plus position|pg||
nt|othered1: But really these small pick-ups are way too little and way too late in thematch.|pg||

pc|h5|nt|daman: N is at fault    South bid their hand    N shd bid 3@H over 3@C to make up for his bidding blunder|pg||
nt|viren169: keep opps under control!|pg||
nt|daman: you can't bid like that Gad     you have nada really|pg||
nt|daman: what are you looking for?  an advance psuedo?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|roswolf: well this contract is doomed|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: should east have doubled 3@H|pg||
nt|joest: north is going to be able to lead his second spade up (with the @h7 as an entry) and west can never get in to push a club through|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Lebensohl struck again. for me it´s easy to bid 3@d on W|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: I dont like that defence!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N is lucky, that this return can´t pickup all @s by W|pg||
nt|ralfwil: there is no ruffs at the table, so why return @s?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|daman: @C Q and @D QJ aren't really working cards after the t/o double|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @dK is better|pg||
nt|odysseus69: strange way to start - maybe only way to try to go down but OK as long as second club now|pg||
nt|sheila a: but will probably be a flat board|pg||
nt|viren169: with 9 or 10 card fit... usually best to bid quickly... as a 2-way shot...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Or after a weak 2 for that matter.|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|viren169: Over a weak 2@S... I am in the 4@S camp!|pg||
pc|h7|nt|joest: if you're willing to live with a super wide range, yes|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now it@s important with @cQ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: still ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 3nt was playable was it not?|pg||
nt|sheila a: mind you, E could just as easily have bid 3NT|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bjacobs: I agree.  I think the correct auction is 1NT - 3NT|pg||
pc|d9|nt|viren169: Over 3@H more difficult...|pg||
nt|daman: as we all are    double dummy|pg||
pc|dK|nt|daman: at the table we would sell out|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mmmakela: takes the club dbl fin|pg||
nt|mmmakela: best chance for 12|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h9|nt|viren169: and when I can see all 4 hands... I bid even more!|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mdgraham: definitely a possibility|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think playing a nebulous club he has to double, rssky though it is|pg||

nt|mariner1: one reason you "MIGHT" hook is shooting for a big score against the field......|pg||
nt|santyclz: May save a few mps.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the other point is this--if you plkay a very aggressive style, as the dutch do, and iuf both partners want to keep palying it, then you simply have to give a lot more leeway & let ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some of the doubles get away from you|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Ohno 4 more ims on 16|pg||
nt|mrdct: so that board is potential gain for ohno if thay bid game next door|pg||
nt|ahollan1: contract was ok at that point - could ruff in dummy exit with loser and still have trump KJ intact|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: as the @s ruff provides the back entry for the @DA and club discard|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: he is ok becos @C lenght is on his left|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: ok back to 18 now :)|pg||
nt|npcjpn: nine tricks for both sides.|pg||
nt|werge: I hope, they play with screens...|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: NS playing weak notrump. but this North hand is too strong for strong notrump.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: screens are up :)|pg||
nt|forni: sound-proof screens? Or did Peake hear Gill screaming?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: there they go again bidding opps suit :)|pg||
nt|werge: Seems to be a weak opening|pg||
nt|forni: very|pg||
nt|forni: but|pg||
nt|forni: as the cards lie... 4@H makes.|pg||
nt|werge: Not on a trump leas - and more of them|pg||
nt|werge: lead|pg||
nt|forni: unless NS decide to lead trump|pg||
nt|forni: hehe|pg||
mb|1N|nt|swanson: 3NT was anti-field - I believe one should just take their best shot to make the contract in that situation.|pg||
nt|janm: Doesn't seem as if "field" was too likely to be relevant - they were in a fairly anti-field contract, unless weak NT is more common in this field than most?|pg||
nt|mrdct: 9 tricks on top in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: here most people would bid 2H as S, showing INV + in clubs|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: and 5 more on 17|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are a million things that can go wrong, in the layout or in the defence. after all, if you had clearly misdefended two games already (as W did in the first set), would you be ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so quick to double?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 5 boards to go here|pg||
nt|werge: We are back to 9 tricks each way|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mariner1: well in Oz with transfer openers and bids its hard to tell :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously NS have had 2 hands too strong and zero that fit (11)12-14 opener or 15-17 rebid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will they rech the good 6@C here ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Pass first|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: honours lying badly for declarer and that dooms the good 5@C contract|pg||
mb|2D|nt|nickf: not uncommon|pg||
nt|keylime: South might like her hand a lot now|pg||
nt|npcjpn: very cautios pass by Green.|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: was 1S-1NT-P 2S-2S-3H|pg||
nt|cindy: not that much i guess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this hand shows the power of shape and aces, NS making 6C with only 22 working HCP|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: she passed very quickly|pg||
nt|npcjpn: if West's minor reversed...|pg||
nt|werge: West should be declarer - trump lead is more difficult for Nortth than for Souht|pg||
nt|forni: true|pg||
nt|forni: but they're not in game, so it really doesn't matter anymore. Too bad, could've used some more exitement|pg||
mb|2N|nt|nickf: but mandatory in NZ where I think they come from|pg||
nt|janm: I think we're one player off here - N opened 1@s|pg||
nt|nickf: Ally, undo the auction|pg||
nt|swanson: Aren't we off by 90 degrees in the bidding here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: can they get to 6@D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duck once -- let Horwitz find correct pointed [@S/@D] shift|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: just kidding ....:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stripe-tailed ape in passout seat|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely 2 @D was inverted |pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am guessing yes. E will like his aces and W will like his trumps and controls|pg||
nt|sybarra: I.e.  =good hand|pg||
nt|keylime: I think you get there once you hear the spade ace|pg||
nt|sybarra: is that inverted?  I should have looked closer |pg||
nt|werge: Nor 4 @D-.tricks possible|pg||
nt|forni: he'll have to play the @D for 4 tricks to make game|pg||
nt|forni: duck a club now|pg||
pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: i assumed it was a simple raise|pg||
nt|mrdct: should make 10 tricks now as the @S finesse is safe|pg||
nt|npcjpn: will shift to spades, I guess.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if K is strong lead -- then Gill has a) denied @HJ  and b) shown doubleton |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: now can duck @D for squeeze that doesn't materialize|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|keylime: declarer will be happy about the 3-0 spade break with the A@c safely tucked away|pg||
nt|keylime: club break I meant|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i don;t think so.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: declarer would probably prefer for 6 not to be cold|pg||
nt|keylime: quite true. |pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: and taaaaaaaaadaaaaaaaaaa|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: whatever the bids meant,  wd to e/w |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are many players who would upgrade the W hand due to the long suit and open 2NT. this hand is an excellent example of why that is so wrong. 2NT openers are slam-killers. here ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E woiuldn;t dream of slam in a million years over 2NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this hand also shows some of the weakness of the point-count. with only 19 HCP, W actually has a better hand in a sense than a 2NT opener because of the long suit and the controls|pg||
nt|cindy: crashed :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this match might now be about even when these last two are compared|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome back|pg||
nt|cindy: ty|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what woke you?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mariner1: good cash for the defense here|pg||
nt|mrdct: might duck a @S now to set up a potential red suit squeeze on west|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|keylime: declarer will probably play a@h, heart ruff A@d, diamond ruff, heart ruff|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mrdct: @D i mean|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: but i think most would have lead @HQ for unblock or count |pg||
pc|hT|pc|c4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mariner1: had to get @D right|pg||
nt|mariner1: has|pg||
pc|c6|nt|janm: So is this round going to be all about diamonds?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Sorry about that auction :)|pg||

nt|bjacobs: 4333 should not use Stayman|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this might provoke some entertainment|pg||
nt|ralfwil: We din´t see why this ended in -3!|pg||
nt|daman: slam time|pg||
nt|viren169: Now a thin slam hand!|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|daman: do we open the East hand?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mdgraham: although as we have seen, East seems a soemwhat cautious bidder|pg||
nt|henryb: another good 3N|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 1@H = 8-11, 5 card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H  8-11|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: looks like EW will settle in 4@S   |pg||
nt|mmmakela: bet overbid to nonmaking 4 @S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: 2@D  in other room   an opportunity for n/s here    3NT cold on diamond break|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N.  For minors or a wild shot?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Is this minors?|pg||
nt|othered1: I like the 2@H bid, which many today would open 1.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: What the difference between after 3@c bid 3@d and partner is a little bit strongen and has to pass?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thin?  This is a rock.  Well above 12.89%.  Much too good for Roland.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I don't know that I could find the good slam here, beginning with a 3@d overcall.|pg||
nt|viren169: Should reach it now...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Bill is too fast, but he is also younger than me|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South contemplating - but I would pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: 5@d cold on @d break and @cA onside|pg||
nt|viren169: Not a bad slam... thin on values...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bjacobs: This is not dissimilar to facing a weak 2@H opening|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's the same, is it not?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 8 trick with bad defence|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: another chance|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and you would pass a weak 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: true sharp values are needed to advance|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes |pg||
nt|sheila a: that lead takes care of the @s finesse|pg||
nt|santyclz: As for your question about opening the e hand.  Yes, but only in the past 2 years or so.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|henryb: I think S should bid again on his hand|pg||
nt|othered1: was north transferring or cue-bidding?  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Obvious a wild shot!|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@d on W has a chance|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @s i mean|pg||
nt|mmmakela: when in w HQ S must switch to low club|pg||
nt|othered1: if west leads parthner's suit, this is down with 6@D making|pg||
nt|viren169: Still a bit of work to do in the bidding... |pg||
pc|dK|nt|henryb: right away|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|othered1: And @H shift after winning @SA is good enough, too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: And also after an initial pass?|pg||
nt|joest: its just that your partner has to be a very good guesser if you could have 0-9 for a 3@d call|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bjacobs: There was a defence to beat 2@H I think|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East leads his top club top start with|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now it´s about overtricks!|pg||
nt|joest: I admit sometimesits nice to be able to bid 2NT natural|pg||
nt|joest: on balance the convention has worked forme|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in fact it´s a kind of bidding style and system|pg||
pc|dT|nt|cuttysark: What should he bid?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: he still might go off|pg||
nt|joest: they pushed that spade slam on board 7|pg||
pc|dA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or like this, king bad|pg||
nt|mmmakela: this must show king in cashout situation|pg||
nt|viren169: I wouldnt! but I've seen it is getting more and more popular!|pg||
nt|viren169: West should make one more try with 4@D|pg||
pc|d8|nt|joest: n-s with four more top tricks coming as long as they don't blow their spade trick or end play themselves|pg||
nt|daman: not a well played match at all|pg||
nt|santyclz: Serious 3nt would have worked well here.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d9|nt|ady: North does have a maximum for the 2@D rebid|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@d, I think|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|roswolf: if east had won the diamond|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Why would you lead the doubleton spade, when holding @CAK10x?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: click on UNDO a few times operator|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's on your toolbar|pg||
nt|roswolf: well bridge atheism is one answer|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm not religious in general, but I think I AM religious about leading from AK suits|pg||
nt|viren169: 2N may have been some form of Romex and 3@H a splinter|pg||
mc|6|nt|sheila a: Surely that was a @h|pg||

nt|santyclz: Sigh, more flat hands.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S EW .,,, NS will be in there too|pg||
nt|janm: Diamonds will be easy to guess on this hand, so only 2 of the 3 had interesting diamond positions :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: and has improved her bridge significantly during that period|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: sorry boards put in wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: she has won back to back National Open Teams playing with Gill|pg||
nt|npcjpn: her debut was 1976 olympiad in Monaco.|pg||
mb|1C|an| |nt|vugrapha3: short break|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: we are on again|pg||
nt|werge: When I started playing bridge, South did NOT have an opening hand...|pg||
nt|forni: good ending for EW in open|pg||
mb|3D|nt|janm: I'm not sure whether the 1NT is strong, and N upgraded, or weak and N decided it wasn't worth more than 1NT - I'll bet the former, though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm trying to remember -- was Horwitz team winner of recent NOT [where Peter was winning his 3rd straight trophy]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops  -- i was typing while Dave was already answering the question|pg||
nt|mrdct: i don't believe she has ever played in an olympiad|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I haven't seen this treatment before|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - East should be partner with South here|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: they are playing board nine :)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|npcjpn: she has played mant times in Olympiad in open category.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and why no 1N opener from North??|pg||
mb|6D|nt|mrdct: nobody plays anything natural over a 1@C opening these days|pg||
nt|werge: Can West stay out of game - 14 HCP facing an opening hand...|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: weak NT allows the auction to be jacked up quick again|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lovely position for w to be in vul vs not.|pg||
nt|keylime: B6 in the open room now|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: I think a trump lead is necessary here to stop game in spades.|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS should score well here|pg||
nt|swanson: BUt, of course, you first have to enter the auction.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H has play, so a make is really big her|pg||
nt|mariner1: here|pg||
nt|keylime: 2@d looks to be the Multi here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my bet -- Fiona misclick    1N-P-2@C puppet to 2@D makes more sense|pg||
nt|mrdct: the 1@C opening might include weak NT hands|pg||
nt|npcjpn: yes, AL, after 1NT opening, thier 2@c is puppet to 2@d.|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: ok, will see board eight later.|pg||
nt|forni: there we go, more trouble for the Aussies|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: they have missed 18 :) |pg||
nt|werge: That´s the price for East double|pg||
nt|werge: East´s|pg||
pc|cK|nt|npcjpn: usually start of a sign-off in a suit.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: one or three club opening?|pg||
nt|werge: This can´t be the bidding - 4 @c from West!?!|pg||
nt|npcjpn: looks normal if the opening bid was 3@c|pg||
nt|werge: Sure|pg||
nt|forni: NS will be able to take the first 6 tricks.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|swanson: One reason that West could consider 4@S is that partner will have at most a singleton heart on the auction.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe 1 nt would have been better? |pg||
nt|sybarra: easy from here |pg||
nt|cindy: 2H seems auto to me with N hand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: that is another option |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|swanson: Still, there is that dark red on the boards looking at West.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: i think i understand the bidding through 1S after that i am lost|pg||
nt|cindy: agree|pg||
nt|keylime: I would have bid 1NT, if not, honor-9 isn't bad for 2@h|pg||
nt|mrdct: this is a pretty handy start to the match for Horwitz|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|keylime: and 10 more imps for 3NT making 4 on B6 for Melbourne|pg||

nt|ahollan1: final board for this set -- next scheduled to begin in  25 minutes, but everything running late today, so who knows|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will we get it back ?|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|dQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: yes so far nobody had commented on the reopening double|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: and "flopping the @H suit)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: cross ruff to 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h6|nt|forni: I think Gill tried to create a big swing|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d5|nt|santyclz: Forgot to lead a @d.|pg||
nt|janm: I think a diamond from West would have beaten this - declarer couldn't get off dummy|pg||
nt|keylime: I would have if possible, rebid 1NT but that may indicate a better hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: EW would be playing 1S against me|pg||
nt|cindy: i was trying to think of something nice to say|pg||
nt|sybarra: cant be but so good,  N was a passed hand|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i lost the play...|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: sorry for this ...|pg||
nt|cindy: and couldnt make neg dbl or bid 1N or raise hearts or anything over 1S|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|d8|nt|swanson: West missed a chance to lock declarer in hand and would have set the contract (aftger ruffing the club)|pg||
nt|swanson: in dummy|pg||
nt|janm: Guess the diamond suit was interesting here after all - declarer has to decide whether to pitch a club, playing for the diamond Q onside or whether to pitch a diamond and give up a ...|pg||
nt|janm: club, going down 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has an awful suit, no real support for any other suit, N is a passed hand, NS are vul, NS have no game, and essentially S has a defensive hand. i wouldn;t dream of reopening ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: under those circumstyances, or even HALF of those circumstances|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i think it was safer to take the @Sa on 1st trick.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|janm: He's going for the make|pg||

nt|npcjpn: four inevitable losers now.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s8|pg||
pc|dK|nt|janm: At least I think so - but maybe now deciding whether to hook the diamond?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s6|nt|swanson: The BBO play would be to discard the @DQ.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mariner1: well now if @D off he is off 2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugrapha3: He could have hooked to the T@d, I spose :)|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer should not have taken the gratuious sulff and ruff in dummy and would have made another trick.  West, on the other hand must duck the first heart, win the second and lead ...|pg||
nt|swanson: a diamond.|pg||
nt|janm: I think declarer had a complete count on West's hand, so knew that if the @d Q was on, it was dropping|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not really after e showed out on the 4th @s.|pg||
nt|mariner1: right John, and he should not have cashed the last @H|pg||
nt|swanson: It's true he could lose control my ruffing in hand, pulling all the trump and then lose the diamond, but the defense was in position to force that.  Something about looking a gift ...|pg||

nt|bjacobs: It'll never get me into the newspapers admittedly|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh well, down 5. A misclaim|pg||
nt|sheila a: Looked as if it was making from that point|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Didn´t N cash his @dA?|pg||
nt|joest: this ought to be apretty routine 4@h by north|pg||
nt|santyclz: Rixi Marcus was decades ahead of her time.|pg||
nt|viren169: I have died many times over!|pg||
nt|daman: if you aren't going to bid your hand properly then don't open a flat 11 point hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: I was fortunate to have known Rixi... she was light years ahead!|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ralfwil: but 11 tricks?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W´s hand is like my opps in rubber|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes After winning with @sA a @h continuation had defeted|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: may have a view to take if diamonds are duckedd twice?|pg||
nt|henryb: One spec points out that partner is often maximum because the opponents have at least 9 spades and have not bid|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: if anything, 2NT is an underbid with those spades|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Ahem|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 8-11|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting 1@H opening...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: needs a @d lead to avoid 12 tricks|pg||
mb|1N|nt|odysseus69: west has good diamond stopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Great stuff|pg||
nt|othered1: AS the cards lie, game in @S or NT is on|pg||
nt|viren169: 2!N is probably good raise in @Hs|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk4: E-W shut out and 4@S is a make|pg||
nt|bjacobs: you put the fear of god into me Roland ...|pg||
nt|sheila a: I have high hopes for this contract. It might break the run of minus scores|pg||
nt|mmmakela: my personal record is 28 HCP|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|odysseus69: west will be feeling ill by now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if E bid pass, they are lycky to find @hA  doubleton|pg||
nt|othered1: That's a very conservative 2@S, even if it shows very substantial values above a minimum double.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me - 3@s is obvious|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Cricket is my religion and Tendulkar is my God. Beat that, Bill|pg||
nt|ralfwil: lucky...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ralfwil: I can´t see why he opens with 1@c with a longer @c? now there are problems|pg||
nt|odysseus69: will East read that??|pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably not and why bid a weaker @h before a good @d?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: What is 5@d?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 29 actually|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with @dK on side, 12 tricks..|pg||
nt|joest: 3@h is a HUGE underbid|pg||
nt|daman: Fritzi Gordon could hold her own |pg||
nt|viren169: 3@C is interesting!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 1 spade unlimited?|pg||
nt|henryb: I think I would risk forcing to game with south: 2@c-2@d-2@s|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not many defenders find the double duck of @DA - and here the ten drops, so it is academic|pg||
nt|ralfwil: soon it´t time for X|pg||
nt|joest: to my way of thinking :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: My guess would be minimum, balanced.|pg||
nt|viren169: been told 3@C is min by specs...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: and I had to take an insurance save at 7-level(true story)|pg||
nt|othered1: As east, I would have bid 4@S.  Two kings are enough for game.  But their standards for double followed by new suit may be lower than mine.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I see your point, but with a weaker hand I had bid 1@h, so 2@c shows something|pg||
nt|othered1: If west is thinking of bidding on, it shows the earlier bids were indequate.  Not good to blow hot and cold on a hand.|pg||
nt|joest: let's see if north doesn't waste his three of hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Well, cricket is a unique game ...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|santyclz: The other possibility is that 2nt was a xfer to @cs.|pg||
nt|daman: posturing before leading the singleton @C|pg||
nt|viren169: N wont believe S has a singleton in @Ds and will switch to @C|pg||
nt|viren169: Not easy for defense...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|odysseus69: good quetion- west knows what it means or what he wants it to mean.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with a correct play 13 teicks!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: tricks!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: what hapenns if there is A8XX|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a natural sequence again 1@c 1@d  1(2)@s....|pg||
nt|odysseus69: table presence needed for double - and for non cA lead- |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Ruff 1@h discard 2@h on @cKQ and discard 2@h on @s .....|pg||
nt|odysseus69: declarer may now think he has a chance|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ruff 2@h I mean|pg||
pc|c7|nt|othered1: I don't have a hasty heart response to a double available.  I'm forced to bid my long suit on most hands, even busts.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 1@h is almost like the roman club exclusion bid|pg||
nt|viren169: probablt the last card I would have thought off!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bjacobs: And what I really like about it is that it annoys the Americans|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now only 12|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and with a @s finess he will make!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if there has been some hesitation, this bidding is something for TD|pg||
pc|d9|nt|viren169: ...probably...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nor the most effective.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: Thanks all, must go now. Enjoy the rest of the show.|pg||
nt|joest: he would have to play wide open to make 13 tricks and Idon't blame him for not doing that|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cuttysark: Spectators right agains - he might as well frop the 10 from A108xAs is pointed |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Never lead partners opening suit!!!!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|odysseus69: now home|pg||
pc|h2|nt|henryb: If two diamonds are ducked, cash three high clubs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: claim 11 and next!|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure what North was playing South to have in @Ds?!?!|pg||
pc|hT|nt|othered1: west is trying to lose the obvious tricks, in case something's poking around in @C|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: A 1S switch was needed. Ruff a @c and clean trumps... that´s it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: claim 12 and next!|pg||
nt|joest: this looks be pretty flat so Curt-Lennart running out of boards to pull this one out|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s3|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|odysseus69: a spade lead was how it should have started|pg||

pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|ralfwil: I have not been at the table, but was this bidding proper?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: the Melbourne team is amassing a big lead, but in baseball parlance they are all "unearned runs", i.,e. unforced errors by the other team. |pg||
nt|cindy: me either|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 12 imps for the slam|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: saving time with the intention of hitting the beach i suppose :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|nickf: I think they may win the event|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|forni: Horwitz did very well in the swiss, but this isn't great bridge what they're showing.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|sunsamvar: i must say Fiona that I had a roaring time in the Gold Coast a few years ago.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: much need 12 imps |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: its my favourite tourney of the year :) so much fun|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: in the other match  Cayne leads 22-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW need to be careful here..... can get too high|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Sorry everyone. Power issues with the laptop :(|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|santyclz: 1nt everybody's rebid?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @S=transfer to 1 nt |pg||
nt|sybarra: (my guess)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the sun, the san, the adventures at seaworld, the night life.. had a ball|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: oh i was on holiday and not playing bridge :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: it is getting a lot of international interest especially with the Yeh Brothers being held here this year|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: what now ?|pg||
nt|keylime: 3@s is a misstatement of the hand|pg||
nt|cindy: N put S on the spot|pg||
nt|keylime: 3@d as well|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D or 3H, depending on agreements|pg||
mb|2H|nt|npcjpn: in the open room, after declarer found trumps break, he took a safety play in diamonds, cashing ace first.|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: many thanks to our great operator.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|cindy: N should just bid 3N|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 2 boards to go after this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have power issues too - but more organic|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|mariner1: now I would not find 1N here|pg||
nt|swanson: E-W should find 4@H and make on a crossruff.  Declarer will need to ruff the third club high to avoid an overruff.|pg||
nt|mariner1: no|pg||
nt|keylime: with 4333 I am heading straight to 3NT once 2@h hits the table as a choice of game|pg||
nt|npcjpn: no double by South?|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I think it depends whether EW are playing weak or strong NT. If weak, this is reasonable - treating the hand as a strong NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: That should solve the ruff problem.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: and South really passed?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: bidding not acurate. I missed the auction sorry|pg||
nt|forni: ...|pg||
nt|forni: I'm not sure what I want to say|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: i bet not actual auction - Fiona entered just to catch up|pg||
nt|npcjpn: and many thanks to organizer and kibitzers.|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well, i don;t think it is clear at all. the right contract could easily be 5D, 6D, 3NT, 4S, etc.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for me, 3C is clear|pg||
nt|keylime: I liked the double for that reason Marshall - to cater to the maximum number of hand types|pg||
nt|cindy: i dont like 3C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but S cannot bid 4H|pg||
nt|cindy: N is the one with the Q of clubs and 4333 shape opposite a minimum hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: same principle for 3C. the golden rule of constructive bidding is that the 3 level is for game exploration. so whenever strain is in doubt, that is what the 3 level is for. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: choosing not to use it means you are pretty sure you know the right contract. i would not be at all sure of that holding the N cards|pg||
nt|forni: either: well done by NS, good stop in 3@D|pg||
mb|p|pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|forni: or... Gill, why on earth wouldn't you bid 3@S?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mrdct: horwitz will be delighted with a 33-1 start given that they can now play their all-pro line-up for the rest of the match|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|cindy: N has notrump cards  queens and jacks|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: might wish he had played another @H?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: thanks to our operator Fiona Brown - especially with the laptop problems|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mariner1: this is a hand where its very important to count your tricks to make sure you end up|pg||
nt|mariner1: with enough.... and more than once|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|cindy: i dont like complicating the bidding while giving away tons of info to the opps|pg||

pc|cT|pc|h5|pc|s5|nt|mariner1: so making 4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i don;t like giving away tons of IMPs to the opponents. in any case, it is not like bidding fast can leave them in the dark about what to lead here. there is no downside in using ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the bidding space, you already know what they are going to lead|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|keylime: Ohno with their first swing - 3NT down 2 in the other room|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Bad luck Sheila!!!!|pg||

nt|othered1: Another huge balanced hand, and in the other room got to game wihtout mentioning 10-card @S fit.|pg||
nt|daman: 2 more boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Now for an unfortunate 4@H N/S way...|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ralfwil: terrible! N must see that a @s switch is needed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Did 1NT not go 1 down on board 7?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I was pretty sure it was going several down, but didn't like to contradict you Sheila|pg||
nt|sheila a: Noooo!!!|pg||
nt|joest: this is a superb 6@c contract and a chance for Curt-Lennart to pull much closer|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|Walddk4: Looking at the play it did|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think so|pg||
nt|daman: should only be down 1    -2 in the OR|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bjacobs: We commentators must back each other up, even when we make bad predictions|pg||
nt|roswolf: now how to bid to slam now?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Why bother? Anything above the 1 level is doomed|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@C is a possibility a spec suggests - i like that if not convenional|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Do you all play 2NT as full value in the balancing seat? I play it a little weaker, 18-20|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm a 19-21 sort of guy|pg||
nt|sheila a: Me too, Bill|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Double and rebid NT = 16-18|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Direct 1NT = 11-15 or so|pg||
mb|d|nt|joest: I've given up on figuring out the 1NT rebid ranges :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mmmakela: ugly t/o dbl imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Operator, you can correct that. Click on MOVIE, highlight board 7 and overwrite:  1NE-1|pg||
nt|mmmakela: wouldn't even consider it|pg||
nt|othered1: North has quite a good hand over a powerhouse opening.  That could affect the decision to bid or not, as partner and east are marked with very little.|pg||
nt|joest: uh oh|pg||
nt|joest: they can't even make this|pg||
nt|viren169: Defense need to be tidy....|pg||
nt|santyclz: It also seems that 4@h was played by e in the open room which seems rather unlikely.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: i am with you bill|pg||
nt|joest: can they get back to clubs?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: west will discard a diamond     now you have to give up a spade to wesst and hope he has no more diamonds  or try the hearts which fails|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I cannot agree with 3@c. 2@h is expensive doubled!|pg||
nt|sheila a: That was tricky for W, but the aces might have persuaded him to have a try|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, Roland, you probably have a bit more clarity with your 1NT balance ...|pg||
nt|joest: oh 4NT was Blackwood!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my system this is quanitative|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: ;Here west had a forcing 2@S available, a normal choice, with NT in reserve, if needed.  East's jump to game is very normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: I had forgotten that the @hA went at trick 1|pg||
nt|othered1: Unluckily, west may be down as many as 2|pg||
nt|santyclz: So the scores may be off even more than we thought.|pg||
nt|viren169: I guess this seq shows a longer suit than bidding 1@H over 1@D...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: this contract is not a lock|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Indeed, there is a very nice play to make it, and perhaps the auction makes it a reasonable shot|pg||
nt|sheila a: S promises 8 HCP|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It is to cash your red winners, and throw South in with the 4th spade|pg||
nt|sheila a: If S is 5-4-3-1, though, that might be wrong?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but it is my experience that declarers dont use the gratuitous info given by forcing pass systems in the play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Break for lunch after this set. Restart at 13.20 local time, in 1 hour and 15 minutes|pg||
pc|c4|nt|joest: double is poor.  West will be on lead vs either clubs or NT.  Why give the hand away?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ralfwil: 3nt in OR was a hit|pg||
nt|joest: this will take a while to play :)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 7@h in OR!|pg||
nt|othered1: You'll see this one in bidding contests in a couple of years.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: I think players have forgotten penalty doubles (optional and converting to penalty)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ralfwil: only a @d ruff on the table|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mmmakela: hope not on this board|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|othered1: duplicated shapes are particularly unlucky here|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Questions, questions...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It might be wrong, so as you are cashing your red winners you look at North's cards closely - he may give honest count|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, final board of the set, and I'd like to thank our nameless operator.  We enjoyed the session, and the boards were interesting|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes good tip bill|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We have no clue as to the scoreline in this match I am sorry to say|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not possible?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't think so|pg||
nt|mmmakela: last one ty all, see ya later!|pg||
nt|othered1: I like the 2@S, forcing, bid.  Partner needs a specific hand to get you beyond 3N at your next turn and often will be right.|pg||
nt|joest: Curt-Lennart within range of pullingthis out if the last board is a swing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like an easy 4@h|pg||

nt|viren169: Thks George and Joe....|pg||
mb|2C|mb|3S|nt|bjacobs: Yes, and thanks to Sheila, Roland and Geoffrey for the commentary|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North must have opened something|pg||
nt|roswolf: so another go!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Undo twice, operator|pg||
nt|sheila a: N should open 1@c on this, if I remember|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think North opens 1@D|pg||
mb|4C|nt|bjacobs: Finally, our appreciation to Filbyter Bridge Club and Carl Ragnarsson for putting on this broadcast|pg||
nt|roswolf: an unusal passout|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Is this an upgraded 14, or are they playing 14-16?|pg||
nt|henryb: I am with him. that is a 15-17 1NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Gaarh!  We was both wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh, he went for an off-shape 12-14 NT|pg||

mb|4D|nt|roswolf: :) i like predictions|pg||
nt|santyclz: I assume Jan in on a plane over there.|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: I might upgrade to 3@h here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree 3@h!|pg||
nt|joest: four trumps; max; ace of diamonds conveniently marked to be at my right|pg||
mb|4H|nt|cuttysark: I would prefer better club quality|pg||
nt|othered1: some might rebid 1N onwest's hand, to try to slow things down.  East now has an interesting call, with nothing perfect (4@D maybe?)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: got to a nice spot|pg||
nt|henryb: you are greedy|pg||
nt|roswolf: east was wet here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I was wronger.  Definitely not 1@D (8-11) - Sheila was unlucky|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Anyway, thanks guys and gal for the nice company|pg||
nt|joest: n-s cannot afford to miss this game andhave any hope of surviving the match|pg||
mb|4N|nt|roswolf: he was worth a raise to 3 surely|pg||
nt|Walddk4: See you later|pg||
nt|sheila a: Let me make another prediction - W will get @s wrong|pg||
nt|xenya: surely wrong score on 23|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: now east has to bid the hand out with 4@D, no, as west isn't all that limited?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|othered1: It would have been different had west rebid 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Interesting choice of lines here... |pg||
nt|santyclz: The open room had 4@h being played by e!|pg||
nt|xenya: which is nonsense?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Obviously.|pg||
mb|6C|nt|othered1: When west opened this, he probably didn't expect to be playing 5@D, or more as partner thinks . . . |pg||
nt|othered1: He does have good side controls, but that's about it.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: and go 6 down?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well done Sheila!  She got one right|pg||
nt|sheila a: possibly|pg||
nt|ralfwil: thx all See you in 30 minutes|pg||
mb|6S|mb|d|nt|sheila a: It was worth the wait|pg||
nt|othered1: In the other room the 2@H opening probably limited the hand enough for east to bail out.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: It´s safe to win with @sA. E cannot have an 8-card @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: East's auction isn't very disciplined, since he produced a strong auction to 4@D and partner never took a forward-going bid.|pg||
nt|xenya: so should be 8 imps to NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 4H showed heart and club control - for sure|pg||
nt|viren169: East will hastily switch to a @C now |pg||
