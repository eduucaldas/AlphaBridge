mb|p|nt|capercliff: 1@d is perfectly normal no?|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
nt|finch: It's easy seeing all four hands, but North was worried about the location of the @S9, as indeed was East|pg||
nt|finch: If NS open 1NT on all balanced 15-17s, declarer knows the @DA is with South|pg||
nt|daman: rock/hard place|pg||
nt|jbgood: @d = one down, a black card = winning?|pg||
nt|finch: @SA, @HQ, @CKQ plus @DA or @DAQ is 15-17|pg||
nt|jbgood: y - he should have the count|pg||
nt|finch: If North would open 1@S with all opening with five spades, it is more of a guess|pg||
nt|jtr: He may ask|pg||
nt|jtr: about their style|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|finch: If East is really on top form, he knows the spade position from the lead and switch|pg||
nt|jtr: He is ok now whatever|pg||
nt|finch: North's club discard has told declarer that they were originally 4-3, so he isn't at risk of a lot of clubs being cashed|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: see anything by accident|pg||
nt|finch: you just play a totally different system.  So 2C is no longer Stayman, for example|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, it might discourage them that 3 times the number of space are watching the other room|pg||

nt|daman: he will probably double on the stregth of partner's 1NT bid|pg||
nt|daman: strength*|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West must be 7-4 on this auction, and then Katz's 12 hcp in the minors are worth close to nothing|pg||
nt|jbgood: I would have doubled with the N hand too - but i would surely have passed with the S hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well judged|pg||
nt|daman: wow    great pass|pg||
pc|cK|nt|finch: North has one defensive trick. From his point of view, how on earth can this be going off if partner can't double?|pg||
nt|ady: well judged    reckoned at best down 1|pg||

pc|h3|nt|jtr: There was a convention called SNAP  Strong No Trump After Passing  Not sure it applied here though|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|finch: South protects 1@S with 1NT with a maximum pass and a spade stop|pg||

mc|10|nt|jtr: Yes right|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|jtr: Many thanks to out excellent operator in Houston,  Jan Martel |pg||
nt|jbgood: well - when prd soesnt double 1 @s he usualkly doesnt have a decent hand with hearts. So what is it to gain by reopening ? Letting the opps find a @h game?|pg||
nt|jtr: Great job Jan!|pg||
nt|jbgood: clap - clap|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Katz "at least I didn't double"|pg||
nt|finch: Being vugraph operator and telling us what is happening at the table at the same time is a tough job|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jtr: Our appreciation to the ACBL for their co-operation in allowing us to present this prestigious event and particularly Rick Beye|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: Jan is the best|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: this might be passed out, and it might also make, so that Katz will regain the lead|pg||

nt|finch: yes, but declarer could have ducked the diamond if necessary|pg||

nt|jtr: Tough @c situation for the defence|pg||
