nt|Walddk2: Scoreboard updated now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thx to our hard working operators and Jan Martel|pg||
nt|henryb: fantastiche|pg||
nt|finch: It's worth discussing what card to play from the West cards on this type of layout|pg||
nt|finch: There's something to be said for the Jack, but that will also give East a problem|pg||

nt|finch: and is now deciding whether to take a second round heart finesse, having seen the 9|pg||
nt|henryb: since which suit to play was in doubt at that point|pg||
nt|finch: it's worth playing the 9 from holdings such as 975 just to make declarer think|pg||
nt|finch: even if it makes no difference on the hand, you want him to wear out his brain|pg||

nt|finch: this is a depressing hand if you are teaching a beginner's class how to take finesses|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: greco i didn't play that suit right|pg||
nt|henryb: But qa good hand for teaching when not to take finesses|pg||
nt|mayors: Greco finds out his @c play wasn't optimal!|pg||
nt|finch: Meckstroth has quite a problem here - it looks like he would be ruffing a loser with a trump trick, so it's 'obvious' to discard|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: meck pause|pg||
nt|finch: but he is tempted to ruff and play a diamond because that may generate another trump trick|pg||
nt|finch: he's hoping for this trump trick, a trump promotion, and then a finesse into his @HQ|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||

pc|h3|nt|mayors: Greco rescues Meckstroth from 1NT which may have been a couple down, but at least he has alighted in an ok spot|pg||
nt|finch: Whatever your view of off-shape 1NT openings, it's much more tempting to open the North hand 1NT if the alternative is a nebuous 1@D|pg||
nt|othered1: nice gadget to have -- 1N got passed out in closed room and east lead and returned @S|pg||

nt|chip: I think pretty much all experts would find it attractive to open 1N. Otherwise no good rebid after 1C-1s|pg||
nt|chip: also lead value in all 4 suits.|pg||
nt|finch: Another trump now risks being forced in hearts and cut off from the diamonds|pg||
nt|othered1: Not much bad can happen since you have @H response to STayman.|pg||
nt|finch: but not another trump now risks 4 trump losers a diamond and a club (or two)|pg||
nt|chip: yes, defense has done well to attack hearts. If declarer finds out about the spade honors will likely guess the diamond Q.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The trouble is that Greco has little clue to the position of the honours|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rod could easily have @DQ|pg||
nt|finch: Greco has a hint that the @CA is onside because they haven't been attacked|pg||

nt|othered1: Can't keep west out forever|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: Specs tell me that it was cold after the spade lead. I suspect they use GIB|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|caitlin: 4@D 3@H 3@S maybe|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mayors: could have made if he played a @d immediately|pg||
nt|finch: the lack of entries to the diamond suit is a slight problem, but it's got a source of tricks in every suit|pg||
nt|mayors: communications for the defence are very awkward|pg||
pc|c2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|kit: North has to unblock the clubs|pg||
nt|caitlin: true North isn't going to cover the @HQ|pg||
nt|finch: Communications not easy for declarer either, he'd rather not have discarded from dummy|pg||
nt|othered1: might it have been better for south to have ducked again?|pg||
nt|kit: cashing the second spade may have been fatal|pg||
nt|finch: looks a bit odd ducking the second diamond; you are assuming that declarer has no entry to the diamonds anyway|pg||
nt|kit: As this lets South set up a key spade trick|pg||
nt|finch: (if he does he's almost certainly got 9 tricks, 4 diamonds, 3 spades, 1 heart, 1 in the wash)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|finch: Rodwell got diamond count from partner, he knows declarer started with five|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|kit: Now if declarer plays clubs, North wins ace of clubs, jack to king, and South can cash 10 of spades and toss the dummy in so defense gets another trick|pg||
nt|kit: But if second spade hadn't been cashed, it might have been another story|pg||
nt|finch: Against some people you would know that spades were 5-1 after the double.  But Rodwell probably doubles more than some.|pg||
nt|mayors: yes then north would have been down to all red cards and declarer could have played A and a heart|pg||
nt|kit: I would guess that Rodwell doubles less than most if anything, since partner's actions can be quite light|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|finch: Yes, but Rodwell may have been hoping for something resembling an opening bid from partner|pg||
nt|caitlin: club now |pg||
nt|finch: Greco has made it Rodwell's problem again|pg||
nt|caitlin: didn't Meckstroth discourage a heart?|pg||
nt|finch: Rodwell will be tempted to play a heart; he must be worried about partner getting endplayed to lead away from the @HK|pg||
nt|finch: swap the @H and @C jacks and I think a heart may be needed now|pg||
nt|kit: rodwell knows his partner has to have ace of clubs, so he shouldn't have a problem playing a club here|pg||
nt|kit: why?  Just cash 2 rounds of clubs and dump him in dummy|pg||
nt|caitlin: I thought Meck's signal of @H2 called for club|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|kit: uh oh|pg||
nt|kit: now it gets tricky -- Rodwell didn't work it out|pg||
nt|kit: declarer has 9 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: not Rodwell's finest defense, for sure|pg||
nt|mayors: It did look like Meck disc @hs and asked for a @c with @h 2|pg||
