nt|mrt2000: who's doing the thinking here?|pg||
nt|granguru: In fact with a @d lead it also can be made|pg||
pc|dK|nt|garnetts: You can bid 2@H over 2@D and expect partner to bid 2@S with three spades and two hearts|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|granguru: it is very against probabilities thou|pg||
nt|viren169: and with a 45xx shape?|pg||
nt|viren169: I would prefer pd to pass 2@H on that seq...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|santyclz: Perfect trumps for a high x-ruff, difficult with 4333 however.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: to avoid a crossruff in the defence, he must clean trumps|pg||
nt|eamongall: however Ireland finish with a win ...finishing with a win is good to quote rory boland |pg||
nt|eamongall: 17-13 victory to Ireland|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|garnetts: AS Peter Goodman has argued that with the odd shapes that are opened 1NT these days it has risk attached |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|ralfwil: clean trumps and take your 9|pg||
pc|dA|nt|eamongall: EBU going to be the champions of Camrose for this year |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|viren169: True... best to pass 2@D and take your chances!|pg||
nt|garnetts: You may be amazed to know I prefer to open 1NT with a balanced hand which excludes most 5-4-2-2 shapes and 6-3-2-2 shapes as well|pg||
nt|viren169: worse hand 3325 shape|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: reckon 3@H was quite well judged - gave South the chance to bid 3N wiht good pointy-suit stops|pg||
