pc|hA|nt|othered1: 3N, played at the other table, has a risk of going down when 6@S makes.  But the 2@C response, assuming it's natural, may minimize the likelihood of @C lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Peggy Bayer: ENG 175 (maximum!) - SCOT 143 - WAL 102 - NI 49 - IRE 44|pg||

nt|bgn: Usually not so valuable to push when you have defence to other major|pg||
nt|hedyg: not sure why she did that since N was a passed hand|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|bgn: North is a demon reopener, so from West's viewpoint quite possible for N to double if West passes 2@S, and South to compete (not on this hand though)|pg||

nt|hedyg: yes in case pd's pass was a trap pass|pg||

nt|othered1: OK, then NS *can* choose to tie themselves in knots with  their NT bidding.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here is a good example hand. What you do not double a weak NT with. Too weak, no attractive lead|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: po tej sesji bedzie przerwa obiadowa|pg||
nt|hedyg: i will not ask why..|pg||
nt|bgn: South splintered in @S there too so I guess East took North's NT bid too seriously|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: pass?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Mind you, the defence was not world class, but still|pg||
nt|othered1: Was west's opening a weak NT at the other table or an upgrade to strong?  That's quite a hand with a good 5-card major to open as a weak NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was a weak NT|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|vugraphpl2: para jassem49,25%|pg||
nt|bgn: wow - I'm surprised West is allowed to pass out 1NT after a redouble!|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: It has become an obsessions for some. When opps open a weak NT, *you* feel you are being robbed because you have a 13 count|pg||
pc|c7|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hedyg: would you plssssssssssss play @H now pd?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d3|nt|othered1: I'll guess this will make on the nose|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|bgn: the @H certainly makes partner happier than anything else :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|dburn: on the other hand, of course, if both North and South have balanced 13 counts and no one doubles, they will indeed have been robbed|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bgn: but still only 1 off I think|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Soputh can hardly have a 13 count for her initial pass|pg||
pc|c2|nt|othered1: but south may have a bit of leeway to double lighter than in the direct position|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: They have not stolen anything from you, so keep a low profile|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|s3|nt|dburn: but I tend to agree that the North hand qualifies for a slow pass rather than a penalty double|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|hedyg: and @s|pg||
pc|s9|nt|othered1: Of course, double by a  passed hand is likely to have a conventional meaning|pg||

nt|othered1: That looks pretty conservative, vulnerable, but it may win imps here|pg||
nt|dburn: good view by North, that - I was thinking he might bid game|pg||

nt|bgn: Oh Hedy, now you've embarrassed me. I would have raised to 2@S, but think West should bid 2NT, not 4@S. Then we can still get to 3@D|pg||

nt|mwigor: but dont like the jump to 4@s with a 4441 and on partners opened suit|pg||

nt|hedyg: why bid 2@s Bruce? 2@d is a natural bid|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|cT|pg||
nt|bgn: because I'm not strong enough to bid 2@S if partner bids 2@H over my 2@D bid. For me that shows extra|pg||

nt|Walddk2: South passed over 4NT|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@S?  even in a limited opening system, stiff honor and acelessness make that ultra aggressive|pg||
nt|athene: north knows his partner has an ace on the bidding, so can lead the @HA and beat 5@S|pg||

nt|dburn: might make an overtrick or so, in truth|pg||
nt|sybarra: actually as pointed out by spec,  how do you NOT make it |pg||
pc|h6|nt|bgn: Interesting auction in other room - looks like they checked back to find 5-3 @H fit, then played 3NT anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: and how did they not make that?|pg||
nt|bgn: can make 3NT also - but have choice of lines. Can play for @D 4-4 or take @S finesse|pg||
nt|olson: they did not finesse the spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D lead?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: 5@C taken as three keycards|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: no bidding in the other room |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe they were convinced that diamonds were 4-4, so they played on clubs and not spades|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Why didnt they double 6@c I am asked. Because South did not bid 6@C, West did|pg||
nt|athene: well north, with an ace in his hand, knows a wheel fell off|pg||
nt|athene: since east is making grand slam tries|pg||
nt|athene: so i think he can deduce it was a misunderstanding over the ambiguous 5@C RKCB bid|pg||
nt|athene: and double|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: But isn't it normal to bid 5@S after the 0 or 3 response? Partner passes with 0 and raises with 3|pg||

nt|othered1: Maybe this is just another RKC problem (of which there are many, even at higher levels than this)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|olson: declarer won the first diamond in the other room,  if ducked  EW might reveal hoiw the suit is splitting |pg||
pc|hT|nt|bgn: so a swing to Havas will make the match close again at the end of the set|pg||
pc|d2|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|henryb: I think there was confusion. West thought he was playing 1430 and showed 1. East decided 1 was impossible and that partner was playing 0314 and that it had to be 3|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: I think they play 1430 and 5@C showed 1 or 4|pg||
pc|s7|pg||

pc|hA|nt|dburn: this can go down two, but the defence is not that easy, and down one is perhaps a more likely outcome|pg||
