nt|Walddk2: But some here|pg||
nt|yuval10: but looks like it might change here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think I ever balanced on a 5 count|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: I had to check the bidding a few times. I could not believe that it was West who had doubled. |pg||
nt|davidb: that one is interesting . see W  X in the closed !  wow !|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: N opened 2@s next door, and after W balance-X and E passed, it was South to save the day and bid 3@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: this could be amusing|pg||
nt|brolucius: I will have to check if 'totally bananas' is a BBO-permitted phrase.|pg||
nt|othered1: does south's pass show @D?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: It's impossible that you can't make 3NT when holding the East cards after a balancing double at the 2-level, vulnerable|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: I see that it isn't. Well, I apologise.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But 'bonkers' is permitted|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and that describes the double quite well|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@S should be OK to make.|pg||
nt|ady: the pass by South would indicate a willingness to play in diamonds  with some holding opposite|pg||

nt|brolucius: With a 5-count, it would be dangerous to protect if you were a passed hand. As a non-passed hand, the action is hard to describe without straying beyond the BBO rules.|pg||
