mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|chick: seems we have 4 of a minor each way|pg||
nt|kareno: If I had to predict I would say n/s will end up in 3@d after a competitive auction.|pg||
nt|kareno: However, Zia fooled me by not making a takeout double of spades :)|pg||
nt|stewball: zia is a bit exposed to compete|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: Kx of @s etc|pg||
mb|1N!|an|15-17|mb|p|mb|4N!|an|min-max|nt|Vugraphu1: Zia actually gave a moment's thought to competing over 1NT|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I know.  But the vulnerability is equal and I would make that bid.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|stewball: well he's not known for his shyness....|pg||
nt|kareno: North has fallen in love with his hand.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|kareno: Good start for the defense!!|pg||
nt|stewball: Hamman goes for the tap with long trumps|pg||
nt|chick: club forces will do a job on him|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Zia: "sounds like a bad hand" Diamond: "calling it a bad hand is an overbid"|pg||
nt|stewball: anti Garrozzo |pg||
pc|c3|pc|s7|pc|cQ|nt|Vugraphu1: Zia: "it got better" as Platnick ruffed|pg||
nt|kareno: If I had to play bridge for my life, Hamman would be my number one choice for a partner.|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|stewball: those are quite the stakes|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, indeed.|pg||
nt|stewball: maxwell smart would say 5 bucks on the side to make it interesting|pg||
nt|kareno: LOL|pg||
nt|chick: I won't bet karen's life, but $5 says he won't make this|pg||
nt|3for3: Hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Danny Sprung|pg||
nt|stewball: hey Danny|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Danny :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, we only allow Coka bets here :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Danny :)|pg||
nt|chick: sorry, I don't sniff coke :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Zia has been studying the dummy with great concentration, still isn't ready to play|pg||
nt|3for3: no coke,pepsi|pg||
nt|kareno: But I wouldn't fade even a ten cent bet on the subject.|pg||
nt|stewball: Hammans lead is a good piece of instruction for the specs...forcing defence with long trumps|pg||
nt|chick: pepsi was playing yesterday |pg||
nt|kareno: Chick if you sniff Coca Cola you will soon look very funny... to us!!|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|chick: looks like this is going to be a loooong session|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rodwell, in CR, tried to pass out 2@s, but east balanced with 3@c, pushing them to the same contract as here|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|stewball: hamman overrules zia|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm not sure I agree with Hamman here, though those diamonds are intimidating.|pg||
nt|stewball: well i know i dont agree with Zia|pg||
nt|kareno: I hope the spades aren't compressed by the defense.|pg||
nt|stewball: he has lousy @h spots for trump plays|pg||
nt|kareno: I prefer Hamman's club attack though.|pg||
nt|chick: when partner starts a forcing defense, trying to switch to playing trumps is kinda self-defeating|pg||
nt|stewball: its so easy from up here|pg||
nt|chick: yeah, but that's still a general statement ... should continue the defense partner started (if you trust him/her) unless you can see an obvious reason not to|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|stewball: cant blame Hamman for overbidding slightly] to show his whole hand|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|kareno: What is the range of their notrump?  Nine with a five-card suit is plenty if it's 15-17.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|stewball: well its a pretty ragged 9 but i dont disagree|pg||

nt|stewball: the hcp are less relevant than the @d fit|pg||

nt|kareno: Their range is a difficult 14-17 hcp.|pg||

nt|april7: and N 4@S|pg||
nt|april7: and probably X by W|pg||
mb|d|nt|april7: its not a good X, because N wants to play in @S, so don't double contracts which are not played|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: It's been a long day for all players, we already widnessed the price (prev'match, where I kib'ed was 5@H -8 with a 4 card fit :) ) |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|stewball: i'm told 3@h didnt promise 4@s..|pg||
nt|kareno: In the other match, 4@s is the contract on this board for those who like to comparison shop :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|chick: that may not fare so well|pg||
nt|stewball: very reasonable of them|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|Vugraphu1: Zia writing a note, probably that he had stronger raises available -|pg||
nt|kareno: Sort of a rattlesnake double by south but it does not show any diamond tolerance at all apparently.|pg||
