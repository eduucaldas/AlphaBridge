nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|mugsmate: hello|pg||
nt|irwinbo: hello everybody|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi all|pg||
nt|kareno: Good morning from Las Vegas :)|pg||
nt|cindy:  hi all|pg||
nt|mugsmate: And from London:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Cindy :)  |pg||
nt|kareno: Jon :)|pg||
nt|cindy:  hi :)   sunny east tennessee here|pg||
nt|mugsmate: There has a been a lot of excellent bridge so far this week. Lets hope for some more.|pg||
nt|kareno: This should be a good matchup!|pg||
nt|mariner1: Sunny (I hope) Seattle too :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Ron ;)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: hi, both partnerships are playing 2/1|pg||
nt|athene: both pairs play fairly normal methods  -  strong NT, 5-card majors, standard carding|pg||
nt|kareno: Rob :)|pg||
nt|athene: but Cayne-Seamon will be opening a bit more soundly than is usual these days|pg||
nt|mariner1: ty Phillip|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. they might be passing 10 counts, even 11 counts!|pg||
nt|kareno: They're just back from a triumph in India.|pg||
nt|kareno: Bill :)|pg||
nt|athene: this gives a new meaning to the term "bidding on air"|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: I think India - it was after the Yeh tournament in any event.|pg||
nt|kareno: Anyone see the hands?|pg||
nt|athene: nope|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mugsmate: Quiet 4H to start|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|athene: helpful lead for declarer|pg||
nt|mugsmate: 12 on that lead|pg||
nt|irwinbo: nickell ND CAYNE ARE SURELY THE FAVORITES BUT ONE NEVER KNOWS|pg||
nt|athene: now the diamonds run happily and declarer gets a club away too|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, time for tea already.  This could be an IMP on the lead.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: I open light also but not balanced 11's.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  n/s can make some @hs here|pg||
nt|athene: i'm surprised Cayne didn't double 1NT|pg||
nt|cindy:  N might have doubled|pg||
nt|athene: that is a t/o double of diamonds|pg||
nt|irwinbo: how many would have doubled with cayne's hand?|pg||
nt|kareno: North could have made a takeout double of 1NT with his perfect distribution.|pg||
nt|cindy:  i would dbl|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kareno: Certainly I would have - this could be a loss of a partscore to Katz.|pg||
nt|cindy:  perfect shape, two aces, vulenerable|pg||
nt|athene: when you have a 4-4 fit you really don't want to defend 1nt because your solid fit is only worth 4 tricks in defence|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: so you often concede -90 or -120 with an easy 110 or 140 your way|pg||
nt|mugsmate: I don't think 1NT will make, though.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|pg||
nt|irwinbo: even game is possible on this one|pg||
nt|kareno: Likely not.  However, in general a good principle is that the hand with the distribution must take action even if a bit light in values.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|mugsmate: In this era, people respond and open very light NV, so it's more likely than in older days that you are being stolen from.|pg||
nt|athene: Seamon sensibly attacks spades rather than just woodenly cashing hearts|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: when you have a solid fit in defence you often want to delay cashing it out and use it for transportation|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Good switch|pg||
nt|athene: so you can attack other suits effectively|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: now the defence use the hearts to cash and unblock spades|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|kareno: Perfect defense by Seamon.|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|mugsmate: They look like they'll cash out for 2 off.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||

mb|2H|nt|lestergold: but this conmtract cant make |pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well 4 @S not sure either though|pg||
nt|mariner1: N having long @S with short @H prevents the make|pg||
nt|lestergold: must lose three minor suit tricks and the hearts cannot be ruffed in dummy without an overruff|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: S did not know that though|pg||
pc|h4|nt|idblu: lots of handling charges in @S's|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H plays well too|pg||

nt|joest: operator I believe the imp score should be 1-0 for Katz.  You probably need to enter board one results which look like they disappeared when we crashed|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|cindy:  3N possible contract|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@D might have pushed E-W into a lucky spot|pg||
nt|kareno: Light weak 2 by Cayne with a side suit of spades.  Could work to e/w benefit.|pg||
nt|cindy:  but @D lead makes it tough|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mugsmate: Needs to knock out the spade first to make this.|pg||
nt|athene: yes, then hope to concede a club to south|pg||
nt|athene: ideally you would like to lead clubs from dummy as an avoidance play |pg||
nt|athene: but entries are short|pg||
nt|kareno: You try to knock out the entry to the long suit.  in this case it would be spades.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kareno: If north signals for spades (in setting up the diamonds) that will make declarer's job easier.|pg||
nt|athene: win @DQ, spade to @SK, probably ducked i guess|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Probably more likely that south has club length than the sA.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||

nt|kareno: Oops.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||

nt|athene: and now seamon returns to spades?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|h7|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mugsmate: Jacobs would make when Cayne held 3 clubs and Seamon had the sA, But in that case Seamon might have brightly shot up with the |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|3N|nt|dburn: now, how are we feeling?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: so a few imps to the chinese|pg||
nt|idblu: I don't know the Chinese team at all...how have they done on the world stage?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: 2@d MIGHT have resulted in 2NT all pass.  Now we're for sure in game|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open it was 2@D - 3N|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: no one can make much hee|pg||
nt|dburn: opening in diamonds won't really affect the matter. Was considering opening 1@s, which might have done|pg||
nt|mariner1: unusual to me to see a prempt holding 4@S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|joest: lauria will just need to work spades first|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is a tough 2@H,,,,,,, lead may help|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: best lead found for defence|pg||
nt|mariner1: @D was best lead|pg||
nt|idblu: bestlead|pg||

nt|lestergold: heh may i rent that word i never saw it before!|pg||
nt|idblu: tongue in cheek Jessica :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes has to knock out N's entry 1st|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open failed to find the line|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it was not completely (or at all) clear|pg||
nt|joest: some risk for Lauria that if he continues spades, Levin might clear them and then Weinstein runs them when in with the club|pg||
nt|chick: think S can keep the @S2 in reserve as entry to partner? :)|pg||

nt|cindy:  yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  i think Cayne was desperate to keep his entry|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|kareno: Cayne eschews this possible weak 2 in hearts.  They will find the suit, however.|pg||
mb|d|mb|1D|nt|kareno: That's correct, Cindy.  |pg||
nt|athene: how many hearts now for north?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|cindy:  cant get too high|pg||
mb|3D|nt|cindy:  best from N hand   |pg||
mb|3H|nt|kareno: That's high enough!|pg||
mb|3S|nt|cindy:  dont think George will find a low spade lead    |pg||
mb|4H|nt|cindy:  maybe now he will !|pg||
nt|irwinbo: ralph can actually make 5 diamonds but he would have to guess very well|pg||
nt|kareno: Even without a spade lead, north/s limit is nine tricks.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i am told Lauria is going down in 3NT on the same line as Jacobs|pg||

pc|c3|nt|mugsmate: He can handle 4 spades with South to the Queen by taking an immediate finesse. That looks normal.|pg||
nt|kareno: Cayne did bid all the way to 4@h so he is marked with some values outside of hearts.  I think Katz well may guess this one out.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: sry lost play of hand, katz considering spade position|pg||
nt|athene: give Seamon the @SQ and might he have enough to bid more than just 3@H - game-try double or something?|pg||
mc|11|nt|mugsmate: Maybe.|pg||
nt|kareno: And obviously he did work it out.|pg||
nt|athene: he would have a 15 count|pg||

nt|mariner1: Open also in 2@H there|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: thank you mariner |pg||
nt|lestergold: if he got it wrong he would use the ten of hearts back to ummy to try the club so he gave himself that extra chance|pg||
nt|mariner1: u r welcome :)|pg||
nt|joest: he could have cashed out for down one|pg||
nt|joest: but a push|pg||
nt|mariner1: this could be an action board|pg||
nt|joest: curious to see what versace does|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: I don't imagine he will do anything for the moment|pg||

nt|mariner1: oh 1@C|pg||
nt|dburn: no, no - Lauria and Versace do not play Precision|pg||
nt|joest: two hearts is a warning side but 5@d is there with good guessing|pg||

mb|p|nt|kareno: An optimistic raise by Katz here.|pg||
nt|cindy:  where were Ws hcp on last hand ?  he had to have some spade honors|pg||

nt|Vugraphu5: on brd 4 Seamon rose on first c|pg||

nt|kareno: Never.  |pg||
nt|kareno: You have transferable values outside spades and only a five-card suit.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|kareno: Without the heart king I might indeed.|pg||
nt|irwinbo: but the old theorey was that first youimpede the opponents, second you tell partner what to lead and third when you open in third seat you imply a full opener|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kareno: I don't know about third :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||
nt|kareno: Since it was much used by Roth & Stone (who recommended a weak 2 in third with a 'chunky' four-card suit, by the way), their third seat openers were always suspect.|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ady: will surely reach 3NT |pg||
nt|lestergold: and make it|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: east and north writing something down|pg||
nt|joest: two schools of thought about doubling Stayman: most play it lead directing but some play it as a weak t/o double of spades|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ady: apart from the spades   cards badly placed|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: board 10 = 3nwmade|pg||
nt|joest: and it appears that Levin and Weinstein might each belong to a different school!|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H plays well here|pg||
nt|joest: I mean doubling Drury|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: movie should reflect that ws updated if not seeing it lemme know and ill hv to close and reopen again|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|chick: so finally we have a few imps on the scoreboard|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: yes but if defence get 2d a spade and a heart thats all their high cards basically|pg||
nt|mariner1: being played from W so defense see big hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphu5: not alerted|pg||

mc|9|nt|kareno: Partner is allowed to be short in diamonds.|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Sometimes you go off in things.|pg||
nt|cindy:  but did Cayne really have a 3@d bid ?|pg||
nt|athene: sure, he had a good hand and vul - partner only needed a doubleton diamond or something|pg||
nt|athene: would expect it to be a flat board|pg||

mb|3H|nt|me argent: doubt it|pg||

nt|othered1: and 3@H?|pg||
nt|me argent: doubt it|pg||
nt|joest: 2@s = either weak or GF.  I believe 2@s would be invitational with spades|pg||
nt|joest: So I'm guessing this shows a heart stopper for 3NT in case his partner has the good hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: south and west discussing 3@h bid from east|pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure where EW are headed here|pg||
