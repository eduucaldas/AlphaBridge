pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|othered1: if he did, maybe west would have withheld the @SJ|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|hedyg: 2@H seems to be on|pg||
nt|athene: west has no entry if he clears his diamonds|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: it looks as though east can build an entry in spades, but declarer can just duck if (say) east leads the S9|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: given time declarer will come to 3 spades, 3 hearts, 1 diamond|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|hedyg: 4@s?|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: 4 spades now :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: he knows S has 4@cs|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: declarer knows west hasn't got the @CA|pg||
nt|athene: because he didn't clear the diamonds|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: he played E not only for Q@S but for Q98x|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pc|h9|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: he might be intending to throw east in to lead away from his (presumed) @SK|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s7|pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: he couldn't imagine west switched from @SK10x :)|pg||
nt|athene: but if you give east all that, he is often doubling 1@C|pg||
nt|athene: @SK, @CAQ, @DA....|pg||
nt|hedyg: doesnt know yet who has Q@C|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|cJ|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|hedyg: 2@s in 3-3?|pg||
nt|hedyg: you mean this bd?|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 30|pg||
nt|sundiszno: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: to those who have tuned in late -- the score above is missing quite a few comparisons from this set, due to a technical problem.  Most of those results favored Szalay, who has ...|pg||
nt|othered1: quite a substantial lead.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: 2@S looks to have a chance|pg||
nt|othered1: nice to h ave a weak jump response available here|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@s=long and weak|pg||
nt|hedyg: why 2NT?|pg||
nt|othered1: But why is east bidding?|pg||
nt|athene: for example if north leads a heart you duck in dummy |pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: 2NT is strange, for sure, facing a weak jump response|pg||
mb|p|nt|sundiszno: we'll play 4 segments of 16 boards, this is the second|pg||
nt|hedyg: guess they dont play the same|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sundiszno: 3rd and 4th segments to be played next tuesday, same time|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: does anyone have the actual score on this?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mariner1: http://mezhon.bridzs.hu/index.html  - Tournament Site|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: he might make this with a trump coup|pg||
nt|athene: given the extremely friendly club layout|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: let's say south pitches a club here....now declarer doesn't need both clubs onside|pg||
nt|athene: just the @CK will do|pg||
nt|athene: diamond ruff, @C to @CQ, diamond ruff, @C to @CA, diamond|pg||
nt|hedyg: he will ruff the @ds now and finesse in @c|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|pc|s2|pc|d6|pg||

nt|othered1: ait does take a tiny bit of timing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He needs @HQ with East anyway, so he might as well ruff a diamond now|pg||

nt|athene: saying "my spades aren't the best suit ever held by an opener, partner"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Dubious action by South|pg||
nt|athene: it's close call i think|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|athene: with 4hcp and a balanced hand, probably passing 1nt was OK|pg||
