nt|joest: actually I'm surprised that Platnick never took a call.  If he does in the closed room itmight make it even easier for Hampson to play 4@h|pg||

nt|dinos1: if @c then dcl may play @sQ pitching @hx|pg||
nt|kareno: Right you are David.|pg||
nt|joest: many systems have built in minor suit length ambiguities and you have to pay a price for that sometimes|pg||
nt|dburn: and he was doubtless hoping so, because @cJ10 would be useful cards in that case|pg||
nt|dburn: still, on this occasion his partner crossed him up by having diamonds despite bidding diamonds|pg||

nt|dburn: with @sJ a winner in dummy, even the counter of exiting with @hQ to block the suit won't work|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Now, how to avoid 3NT and reach 5@D instead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although 3NT by North is OK|pg||
nt|kareno: Can't get there now.|pg||
nt|joest: tough to achieve that trick now|pg||
nt|jbgood: impossible|pg||
nt|kareno: East will double clubs.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|nt|dinos1: stayman - X, and then?|pg||
nt|kareno: (or should).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But that is what they need, is it not?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Some play that you can deny a club stopper now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: either by passing or redoubling|pg||
nt|joest: it might go 3@d - 5@d now if they're bidding naturally|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I have understandings about pass, redouble and bid by each hand in this case.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would also bid 2@H, which denies a club stopper|pg||
nt|dburn: North may see the danger, of course - the question is, what methods does he have to do something about it?|pg||
nt|dinos1: why not open 1@d with 54 and all pts in long suits?|pg||
nt|kareno: It is the rebid problem.  |pg||
nt|jbgood: 3@c might get them to 5@d now|pg||
nt|kareno: 1nt rebid shows a lesser hand than this.|pg||
nt|dburn: because you have a rather awkward rebid over 1@s, although 2@h in the context of a strong club might be OK|pg||
nt|jbgood: with a max hand you are allowed to reverse playing strong club - so 1 @d - 1 @s - 2 @h|pg||
nt|joest: Greco made FIVE nt in the closed room so we have new leaders|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kareno: The hand is too skewed in high cards as well as lengths for me to be willing to open it 1NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Well done!!|pg||
nt|dburn: this is likely to work well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D is a clever bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must show longer diamonds than the four spades he has announced now|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|kareno: 4@s in case of a Moysian fit?|pg||
nt|jbgood: so what did we know about the final contract:)|pg||
nt|joest: Platnick hates his hand and if four diamonds is not clearly forcing..............|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Platnick knows they have two club losers, so the rest must be high. Can he believe that?|pg||
nt|dinos1: how about 4@c rebid?|pg||
nt|dinos1: instead of 4@d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They may even have three club losers|pg||
nt|joest: on two small?|pg||
nt|dinos1: will show @cxx|pg||
nt|joest: I like a simple 5@d.  All my values are in diamonds and hearts.  over and out.  |pg||
nt|dinos1: with @cxxx u shd stop in 4@d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The vulnerability will persuade him to bid game I think|pg||
nt|kareno: If their range is 14-16 then passing is a terribly deep position to take.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Exactly|pg||
nt|dburn: it's a massive position to pass - though it could indeed be right|pg||

nt|dburn: Platnick and Diamond's good effort in reaching 5@d actually lost an IMP when North played 3NT at the other table|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: have to admit, i thankfully have no comment to that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It has been good bridge so far, a joy to watch the best in action|pg||

nt|dinos1: @h fit and @c values?|pg||
nt|jbgood: but even with a club fit and 3 hearts with prd - even 3 @h needs some good guessing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can see that it's prudent to stay low on this layout, but Diamond does not have the benefit of knowing the other 39 cards|pg||
nt|dinos1: it's becoz @sQ is useless here|pg||
nt|joest: right.  I was asking on general principles.  The pluses are 6-4 pattern and good hearts|pg||

nt|Walddk2: A college class was told they had to write a short story in as few words as possible. The short story had to contain the following three things: (1) Religion, (2) Sexuality, (3) ...|pg||

nt|kareno: Sure, Roland.  |pg||
