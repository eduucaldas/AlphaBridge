mb|1S|mb|p|nt|pelu: we are playing 17+18 sp CR can get ahead|pg||
nt|snorris: sorry he didnt, changed to 1 @d |pg||
nt|vugraphzku: last possibility for CR to catch the clock|pg||
nt|pelu: they have all the difficult board in CR :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: our hands are the easy ones LOL|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: hahahaha|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|capercliff: I remember playing against some of the players in the other room, very thoughtful:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|sybarra: pass by W,   guess they are not jrs. |pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: interesting opening 3@d|pg||
mb|5D|nt|capercliff: yes indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: my guess is he could not open 2 @D that would be multi,  1 @D a bit of an overstatement so....|pg||
nt|snorris: got them too high|pg||
mb|5H|nt|capercliff: 1@d is perfectly normal no?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: if u open 1@D opp can find their @S-fit - making 10 tricks!|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|mb|7S|nt|snorris: but then again e-w can win something|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe he thought 1 @D was too much,  but in 3rd chair, maybe felt he had to bid 3 |pg||
nt|pelu: I would open 1@D - but here it worked well - no D - no trouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: 4 easy @s|pg||

nt|othered1: Rehi, everyone!|pg||
mb|7S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: but Hampson would have been concerned if double said explicitly "don't lead spades"|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Meckstroth saying "should probably double"|pg||

nt|me argent: and the weather is sunny:)|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|dburn: well, Greco would perhaps have felt confident for a moment - but that was then, and this is now|pg||

pc|d6|nt|stewball: why isnt declarer playing on @cs?|pg||
nt|stewball: hey Fred welcome|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: this is all artificial - probably 2@h had many meanings, 2@s asked, 2NT was a balanced minimum and 5NT said "I'm fed up with all these relays"|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: The Pszczola team just came in and conceded, so the Nickell and Katz teams have now advanced to tomorrow|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Vugraphu1: Hampson explained the auction, but I didn't get it all - I think that 2@h showed club support, 2@s and 2N were both artificial and somehow created a game force. 5N choice of slams, ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: 6@c and 6@d suggested trump suits and 6N to play|pg||

pc|hK|nt|dburn: some helpful kibitzers have contributed their thoughts on the auction also - the consensus appears to be that 6@d was off the map|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2H showed 11-13 unbalanced. 2S was a relay to 2NT but didnt have to be used. 5NT was pick a slam |pg||
