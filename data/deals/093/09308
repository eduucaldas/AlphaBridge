mb|1D|nt|othered1: rehi, everyone|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: will be a routine 4@H contract|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: i think we'll be able to follow most or all of the auctions for both pairs -- without need of a translator|pg||
nt|roswolf: that will be refreshing!|pg||
nt|kit: play not clear after 4-1 heart split, but 3-3 clubs will see declarer home|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: I will update matches during breaks.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but if NS dealt opening bid with 4@S and 5@H -- let's hope Roland isn't in the room|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Nickel +35 over berg.|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah the F convention?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: shhhhh|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Lynch +28 over O'Rourke.|pg||
nt|jbgood: E may get endplayed in trumps now - and will have to lead rom the spade ace. Requires some di ruffs to strip E out of escape cards|pg||
nt|kit: won't declarer just take heart finesse?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Please wait for all updates or I will cease thanks.|pg||
nt|jbgood: sure - but for the overtrick:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm looking at all the hands this is easy enough but at the table that's a different matter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: our match is Katz  6 seed vs Deutsch 22|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Longzhn +33 over welland.|pg||
nt|kit: if worried about a club ruff he might play off top hearts, but that could work out badly here|pg||
nt|kit: for all declarer knows he needs to take 6 heart tricks, so I can't see him not taking the finesse|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would expect a push here with declarer making 11 tricks after the lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Cayne +40 over wrang.|pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: No I lost a trick sorry.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can declarer rely upon 33@C and elope small trump -- eventually coming down to @HKJ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok np|pg||
nt|janm: Scores at quarter (blanks haven't been reported - will try to get): Scores at the quarter (blanks haven't been reported, sorry): Nickell 60 - Berg 25; Cayne 58 - Hollman 18; Multon ...|pg||

nt|kit: I think 2@C was probably some kind of Q-bid|pg||
nt|othered1: But  from there the auction just seemed to keep on going|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we were all confused when North bid @C while actually holding @C :)|pg||
nt|othered1: seems, rather|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4@s the only making game..|pg||
nt|jbgood: or ...?|pg||
nt|kit: South will probably pass since not doubled yet|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder what the difference would be between cue-bid then 2N and a direct 2!N?  for me the former would have better @S tolerence|pg||
nt|kit: Even if South gets to 4@S, he will probably misguess the spades since West opened|pg||
nt|jbgood: very true Kit|pg||
nt|kit: although maybe he has to guess them right as he needs to get to his hand|pg||
nt|othered1: spec suggests that if Levin bids, it will be 4@H.  Possible, I  guess.|pg||
nt|jbgood: a kib suggests he might get a trump lead in 4 @s - that would not be very likely on this bidding|pg||
nt|kit: meanwhile 3NT might well make if East leads a club, his partner's "suit"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even with this -- we're still 3 boards ahead of Closed Room|pg||
nt|roswolf: levin might well pass - the hands are not really suitable for suitplay|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: I still think he will pass for fear that any higher bid will be doubled|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|roswolf: and the atomatic club lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: automatic|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kit: West should probably play queen of clubs, since he doesn't know what to do if he wins the ace|pg||
nt|othered1: But was it automatic?  Doesn't it sound likenorth has @C values and length?|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|kit: Good play -- now it is declarer's problem what to play|pg||
nt|jbgood: nice queen|pg||
nt|roswolf: well yes except in practice declarer may well get the trumps wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: small @H?|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't think 4@S necessarily depends on @S guess.|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, I think he will duck a heart and pray that both major-suit kings are onside|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: South could not take it anymore he has left the table.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've heard that somewhere before --- pray if you got 'em|pg||
nt|kit: I don't see any other route to 9 tricks from his point of view -- remember, he doesn't know the club position|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||

nt|roswolf: why the 9?|pg||
nt|kit: probably vugraph error|pg||
nt|jbgood: Q10 doubleton in |pg||
nt|jbgood: @d |pg||
nt|kit: or maybe 8 was led?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: trying to convince declarer @H33?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: No 9 was played.|pg||
nt|jbgood: was also a contractgiving plan without needing the spade finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drewsky suggesting   maybe a form of Smith echo in play|pg||

nt|kit: Now the moment of truth|pg||
nt|ahollan1: drum roll --- or theme from jaws|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed for the overtrick as well|pg||
nt|kit: East discarded well -- at cost of overtrick, he created the guess position|pg||
nt|kit: Big question is where is queen of diamonds -- what was the signalling -- how long did it take West to find the diamond shift|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and .... has Bobby returned to the table|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think he will go for end-play -- West did shift to low diamond, so if that is honest he has another diamond|pg||

nt|ahollan1: isn't there a rule -- if expert given option of finesse or endplay -- obligated to try endplay|pg||
