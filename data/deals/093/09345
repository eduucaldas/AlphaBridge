mb|3D|nt|hedyg: except they dont get to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 3N, played at the other table, has a risk of going down when 6@S makes.  But the 2@C response, assuming it's natural, may minimize the likelihood of @C lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Peggy Bayer: ENG 175 (maximum!) - SCOT 143 - WAL 102 - NI 49 - IRE 44|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: I hate the 3N bid, wonder if 2N would have been nonforcing or would have shown many extras, part of a hateful fast arrival approach to this auction?|pg||

mb|p|nt|bgn: Usually not so valuable to push when you have defence to other major|pg||
nt|hedyg: not sure why she did that since N was a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|pc|s7|nt|bgn: North is a demon reopener, so from West's viewpoint quite possible for N to double if West passes 2@S, and South to compete (not on this hand though)|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|dburn: I don't imagine 2NT would have been forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes in case pd's pass was a trap pass|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|dburn: so that South could not really do other than bid 3NT - North did not have to pass it, of course, but one can see why he might|pg||
nt|othered1: Then maybe 2N forcing over 1@S?  Seems a better description than starting off with a semi-psych.|pg||

nt|othered1: OK, then NS *can* choose to tie themselves in knots with  their NT bidding.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here is a good example hand. What you do not double a weak NT with. Too weak, no attractive lead|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: po tej sesji bedzie przerwa obiadowa|pg||
nt|hedyg: i will not ask why..|pg||
nt|bgn: South splintered in @S there too so I guess East took North's NT bid too seriously|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|hedyg: might be so|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: pass?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: Mind you, the defence was not world class, but still|pg||
nt|othered1: Was west's opening a weak NT at the other table or an upgrade to strong?  That's quite a hand with a good 5-card major to open as a weak NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was a weak NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|vugraphpl2: para jassem49,25%|pg||
nt|bgn: wow - I'm surprised West is allowed to pass out 1NT after a redouble!|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: maybe she should have bid 1@s and not XX, has no bid now|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It has become an obsessions for some. When opps open a weak NT, *you* feel you are being robbed because you have a 13 count|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: would you plssssssssssss play @H now pd?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|othered1: I'll guess this will make on the nose|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h4|nt|bgn: the @H certainly makes partner happier than anything else :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|dburn: on the other hand, of course, if both North and South have balanced 13 counts and no one doubles, they will indeed have been robbed|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bgn: but still only 1 off I think|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Soputh can hardly have a 13 count for her initial pass|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: but south may have a bit of leeway to double lighter than in the direct position|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: They have not stolen anything from you, so keep a low profile|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: but I tend to agree that the North hand qualifies for a slow pass rather than a penalty double|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: and @s|pg||
pc|h6|nt|othered1: Of course, double by a  passed hand is likely to have a conventional meaning|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: Normal, pushy 3N at the other table.  Should be equalled here|pg||

pc|cA|nt|the saint: The party tonight will go on a while too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5-5, all high cards in your suits and NV v V|pg||
nt|othered1: So would I, especially if I had a 2-suited bid available|pg||
nt|bgn: West might evern have raised @H rather than rebid @S?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chick: and I|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|othered1: That looks pretty conservative, vulnerable, but it may win imps here|pg||
nt|dburn: good view by North, that - I was thinking he might bid game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is makeable with all cards in view, but it's much more difficult at the table|pg||
nt|hedyg: not like her @s are that good|pg||
nt|hedyg: A10 surely worth xxx|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||

nt|hedyg: the contract got what it deserved|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s2|pc|h4|nt|hedyg: no need to raise to 2@s on xxx with a perfectly good 2@d rebid|pg||

pc|cT|pc|hA|nt|hedyg: Niek is she thinking really?|pg||
nt|mwigor: for what its worth i like the 2@s raise|pg||
nt|bgn: Oh Hedy, now you've embarrassed me. I would have raised to 2@S, but think West should bid 2NT, not 4@S. Then we can still get to 3@D|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: yes|pg||
nt|mwigor: but dont like the jump to 4@s with a 4441 and on partners opened suit|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|hedyg: why bid 2@s Bruce? 2@d is a natural bid|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|bgn: because I'm not strong enough to bid 2@S if partner bids 2@H over my 2@D bid. For me that shows extra|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|hedyg: so we will play 2@H?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hedyg: agree about the extras|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not sure what 2@H was in the closed room, but E-W knew|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A spade raise of some kind|pg||
nt|sybarra: starting the scramble with the XX |pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|othered1: transfer response of some type?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: close to making 4 @H here|pg||
nt|sybarra: or might in fact make |pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: Undo please|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South passed over 4NT|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@S?  even in a limited opening system, stiff honor and acelessness make that ultra aggressive|pg||
nt|athene: north knows his partner has an ace on the bidding, so can lead the @HA and beat 5@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|vugraphpl2: http://pzbs.pl/wyniki/2009/krajowe/gpp/02pila/gp.html|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Oh well, they really are tired|pg||
nt|dburn: might make an overtrick or so, in truth|pg||
nt|sybarra: actually as pointed out by spec,  how do you NOT make it |pg||
mb|p|nt|bgn: Interesting auction in other room - looks like they checked back to find 5-3 @H fit, then played 3NT anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: and how did they not make that?|pg||
nt|bgn: can make 3NT also - but have choice of lines. Can play for @D 4-4 or take @S finesse|pg||
nt|olson: they did not finesse the spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D lead?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: 5@C taken as three keycards|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: no bidding in the other room |pg||
pc|s7|nt|dburn: maybe they were convinced that diamonds were 4-4, so they played on clubs and not spades|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: Why didnt they double 6@c I am asked. Because South did not bid 6@C, West did|pg||
nt|athene: well north, with an ace in his hand, knows a wheel fell off|pg||
nt|athene: since east is making grand slam tries|pg||
nt|athene: so i think he can deduce it was a misunderstanding over the ambiguous 5@C RKCB bid|pg||
nt|athene: and double|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: But isn't it normal to bid 5@S after the 0 or 3 response? Partner passes with 0 and raises with 3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|othered1: Maybe this is just another RKC problem (of which there are many, even at higher levels than this)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|olson: declarer won the first diamond in the other room,  if ducked  EW might reveal hoiw the suit is splitting |pg||
pc|c8|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|henryb: I think there was confusion. West thought he was playing 1430 and showed 1. East decided 1 was impossible and that partner was playing 0314 and that it had to be 3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: I think they play 1430 and 5@C showed 1 or 4|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hA|nt|othered1: it coiuldn't have been 4 from east's perspective|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: and making 6! |pg||
