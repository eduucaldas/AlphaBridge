pc|d7|nt|oosmanb: well @S lead is the only double dummy lead on which you can not make|pg||

nt|werge: Yes - but if he doubles, itÂ´s over. With pass - itÂ´s more delicate|pg||
nt|lestergold: whether or not there ae screens a long hesitation can convey significant info inadvertently or unintentionally albeit|pg||
