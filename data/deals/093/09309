nt|sybarra: and Joey Silver may join in at his leisure|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Wont enjoy it if he does|pg||
nt|sharkey: see they're down quite a bit on the list - the field here, however, is awfully tough|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Declarer needs to finesse to ensure no entry to South for a heart through|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mmmakela: Apteker means "pharmacist" in Swedish|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: and the distractions many :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: think a plus here is a good score|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hanlon took the low route here and decided not to stretch for the non vulgame|pg||
nt|sharkey: limited communications between the hands makes game tough|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.  Hi Cornelia, Markku.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: any votes for 3 NT by S?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i suppose Zmud with his 5 crd support had to bid 5@S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sunsamvar: yes @S lead and continuation will force declarer to lose trump control|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sharkey: i think defence will prevail unless declarer can drop @CQ|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|othered1: Now Wiz is down, if NS get this right|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: A technical error by Seamon I think|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: in 4@H ie|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mmmakela: instead of 4 H|pg||

mb|3S|nt|sharkey: The 2@S opening shutting out NS I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: 4@s theoretically much better.  |pg||
nt|mmmakela: as a bid yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: easy @h game here|pg||
nt|sharkey: S's hand awkward; @SQ poorly placed, only 3 @H, and @D not good enough|pg||

mb|d|nt|robinswr: especially when hearts are clearly the trump suit|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: easy 6@H here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but n/s may barrage in @S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharkey: previous hand easier if S leads low @D - then he can cash 2nd @D trick after ruff - makes it easier for pd|pg||
nt|sharkey: 6@S is not a cheap save - looks like -1400|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|chick: goulash is right, markku :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: brave bid by south|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Yes there is much to be said for using kickback Blackwood when the trump suit is a minor or @H|pg||
nt|robinswr: before North bid rkc he had to go over the responses and think about the 5spade response|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: may end up in6@C.. which also makes|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - not sure if 4@S has any significance aside from being forcing|pg||

nt|sharkey: now... - cud pick up an IMP here...|pg||
nt|sharkey: didnt :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Somehow E showed his @H suit - and as far as I know they play a natural system where 1@C is natural and non-forcing|pg||
pc|s4|nt|me argent: couldnt stand 2 sell out 2 an 8 card fit at 2 level larry cohen would be proud|pg||
nt|othered1: He did have a partner who was still live|pg||

pc|cA|nt|robinswr: the 10 of clubs would make life difficult for weinstein|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: meanwhile the Americans in the open room did well to sacrifice in 5@C on bd 2...|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: but lost 11 imps cause here they overshot to the doomed 6@H|pg||
