nt|vugrapha1: no rob 1st gets BB OR PABF|pg||
nt|mariner1: N continuing over 4@S in the Closed just seems too aggressive|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 2nd gets the other event|pg||
nt|geot: Swing here? CR: After a 1S opening (canape style?) and 4H, 4S by South, North went on|pg||
mb|1C|mb|4H|nt|mariner1: or OR..... then 2nd gets the other one|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugrapha1: the two semi-final winners are guaranteed a guernsey|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i forget which zone is which   of 6 & 7   PABF is zonal for one,  the other is just the 4 teams including OZ & NZ -- but PABF invites others to play|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: PABF = zone 6|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: the zone 7 champs are australia NZ and some pacific islands|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: so 4 team playoff with NZ & OZ = Zone 7|pg||
nt|mariner1: much calmer auction here|pg||
nt|geot: In this 4@S declarer has some work to do before he gets his 10 imps|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mariner1: so Green should be back close|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: French Polynesia, New Caledonia  or something like that for the other 2 teams|pg||
nt|geot: club guess, diamond guess, spade guess....|pg||
nt|olson: Y , E is endplayed winning the spade ace|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: varies which countries send teams|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: fiji and tonga both have at some points i think as well|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|olson: and will not open a minor suit  or the ruff sluff  gets rid of a possible loser|pg||
nt|ahollan1: club guess should be easy -- not so clear about @D|pg||
nt|geot: East is endplayed but heart back is probably the best defence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: If Sartaj [Hans] gets good count on hand, he may go wrong in @D|pg||
nt|geot: I think Hans will win the contract, but it is certainly not obvious|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: does ruff dummy pitch @D from hand add chances?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|olson: it would still come down to the club guess since trumps 3/1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming always finding @C just thinking pitch @D from hand then just needs @D 32 either way|pg||
nt|olson: why is it clear to play the 4h bidder for great hearts and 2 side aces ?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|geot: why is it so obvious to find the clubs right, Al?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: not a good hand for GIB - because it peeks -- knows where @DQ is  -- pure double dummy|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just thinking @CA in 4@H had -- if West had that card AND 4 card support, might not pass 4@S|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s4|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|geot: hearts may be 8-3 from declarers point of view|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not strong inferences -- but something to start with?|pg||
nt|geot: sure|pg||
nt|olson: e giving a  known ruff sluff would probably mean he does not want to open up minors,  |pg||
nt|olson: as he would exit a trump  if they were 2/2|pg||
nt|geot: Not with AJ maybe, hoping to score the J|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|olson: so w is likely 1732 since Declarer can ruff a club and find @D 3/2 and finesse E for the Q is possible|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right Jeff|pg||
nt|geot: Anyway, interesting hand, and lets see if Nunn can make it, for 10 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hans doesn't know it, but the WORST he can do is push the board|pg||
nt|geot: Hans I mean|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: when all is said and done -- kudos to De Livera for the ruff/sluff which actually complicated declarer's options|pg||

pc|dT|nt|geot: oh.....|pg||
mc|9|nt|olson: y  good  def  not to open up  minors|pg||
nt|geot: He had a pretty good count of the hand, and played for the diamond finesse through the three carder|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: i think ruffing in dummy and pitching a @d from hand was the stronger play|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes good defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wish we had Michael Rosenberg or Bart Bramley for that single dummy analysis :(|pg||

nt|kareno: Oh, we only allow Coka bets here :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Danny :)|pg||
nt|chick: sorry, I don't sniff coke :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Zia has been studying the dummy with great concentration, still isn't ready to play|pg||
nt|3for3: no coke,pepsi|pg||
nt|kareno: But I wouldn't fade even a ten cent bet on the subject.|pg||
nt|stewball: Hammans lead is a good piece of instruction for the specs...forcing defence with long trumps|pg||
nt|chick: pepsi was playing yesterday |pg||
nt|kareno: Chick if you sniff Coca Cola you will soon look very funny... to us!!|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|chick: looks like this is going to be a loooong session|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rodwell, in CR, tried to pass out 2@s, but east balanced with 3@c, pushing them to the same contract as here|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|hT|nt|stewball: hamman overrules zia|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm not sure I agree with Hamman here, though those diamonds are intimidating.|pg||
nt|stewball: well i know i dont agree with Zia|pg||
nt|kareno: I hope the spades aren't compressed by the defense.|pg||
nt|stewball: he has lousy @h spots for trump plays|pg||
nt|kareno: I prefer Hamman's club attack though.|pg||
nt|chick: when partner starts a forcing defense, trying to switch to playing trumps is kinda self-defeating|pg||
nt|stewball: its so easy from up here|pg||
nt|chick: yeah, but that's still a general statement ... should continue the defense partner started (if you trust him/her) unless you can see an obvious reason not to|pg||

nt|mariner1: DBL by me here denies I had a 5 card major UNLESS I also have a rebidable one|pg||
nt|olson: partner  never  bids   AJX of @S over my double and  we fail to find 5/3 major fits,   we would all prefer to have a better suit at these colors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: MAYBE [keyword] ok with 3@S & 5@H  because partner bids @H with 33 -- but even then I overcall|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i think then ping-pong endplay dummy & west -- just not positive|pg||

mb|p|nt|kareno: Yes but they needed to match the pushiness from this room :)|pg||
nt|3for3: down 59 means bid any game in sight|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|stewball: i confess i would have passed 2@s regardless|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Diamond asked about 3@h and Zia says normally just spades and hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: but i cant stomach going down in 3 after a game try|pg||
nt|3for3: certainly could happen with that hand|pg||

mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|kareno: Right game!!  Now to make it!|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm betting on Hamman to make it|pg||

nt|3for3: hard to see what diamond is thinking about here|pg||
nt|3for3: partner did double 4@D|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamond lead was called.|pg||

nt|3for3: maybe he is deciding which spot|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|3for3: they play 4th best|pg||
nt|kareno: To avoid north, Hamman will no doubt play jack of spades first.  But it is the second dummy entry that is tricky.|pg||
nt|3for3: and that is what he lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Hamman's thinking|pg||
nt|3for3: 9 of hearts to the ace?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|3for3: king first though, duh|pg||
nt|kareno: No luck in the heart suit for a second entry.|pg||
nt|stewball: he may be forced by the entry situation to lead a @s to the 8|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|h3|pg||

nt|3for3: playing RHO for honor x in spades, i guess|pg||
nt|stewball: @s to the 8 requires a helpful defensive play|pg||
nt|stewball: results i mean|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I was hoping he'd show me his hand so I could see whether he had unblocked it - I thought he played the 4, but it wasn't clear - now showed me his hand and it's the 9 still there|pg||
