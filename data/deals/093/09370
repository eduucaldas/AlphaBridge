nt|hussein2: They pllay 2@h as one round forcing, so 3@h can be of a 10 HCP|pg||

pc|c3|nt|mrt2000: who's doing the thinking here?|pg||
nt|granguru: In fact with a @d lead it also can be made|pg||
pc|c9|nt|garnetts: You can bid 2@H over 2@D and expect partner to bid 2@S with three spades and two hearts|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d6|nt|granguru: it is very against probabilities thou|pg||
nt|viren169: and with a 45xx shape?|pg||
nt|viren169: I would prefer pd to pass 2@H on that seq...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|santyclz: Perfect trumps for a high x-ruff, difficult with 4333 however.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: to avoid a crossruff in the defence, he must clean trumps|pg||
nt|eamongall: however Ireland finish with a win ...finishing with a win is good to quote rory boland |pg||
nt|eamongall: 17-13 victory to Ireland|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|garnetts: AS Peter Goodman has argued that with the odd shapes that are opened 1NT these days it has risk attached |pg||
pc|c5|pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: clean trumps and take your 9|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|eamongall: EBU going to be the champions of Camrose for this year |pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|viren169: True... best to pass 2@D and take your chances!|pg||
nt|garnetts: You may be amazed to know I prefer to open 1NT with a balanced hand which excludes most 5-4-2-2 shapes and 6-3-2-2 shapes as well|pg||
nt|viren169: worse hand 3325 shape|pg||
nt|mrt2000: that's it from this table fir now.|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: Yes I agree...|pg||
nt|garnetts: Lets get this one out of the way--3@H is horrendous |pg||

nt|viren169: The 3@C had the desired effect that South intended...|pg||
nt|garnetts: Problem is that North might have erroneously saved when it was going off|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobholl: 4-6 3@S and with 7-9 and @S bid 2@H that can't be real :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|granguru: well - when playing ghestem michaels copenhagen or any other....normally you have an opportunity to show the great hand by bidding again|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: reckon 3@H was quite well judged - gave South the chance to bid 3N wiht good pointy-suit stops|pg||

nt|eamongall: 4@S-1 is a sad effort by Walsh O'gorman |pg||

nt|sharkirl: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: without any special reason|pg||
mb|3H|nt|santyclz: Y, @c duck with those beautiful @ss was very strange.|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Now 2@S over 2@C should be normal... keeping North out of the auction (Not that he wants to come in!)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|mdgraham: what?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: And you know your P @d|pg||
nt|starkist: hmm|pg||
nt|ralfwil: leading from a 10 or J often gives declarer a good help|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Looks like West was more worried about letting N in|pg||
nt|garnetts: I must admit that 2@S would always get me a singleton trump|pg||
nt|viren169: 8/9 tricks available here for a flat(ish) board|pg||
nt|sharkirl: can this be true??|pg||
nt|starkist: intended as forcing i'm sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: would have thought so|pg||
nt|sharkirl: 4c is Walshe|pg||

nt|eamongall: Adam Mesbur and Pat Walshe have had a miserable/unlucky  time this weekend |pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: void for me!|pg||

nt|viren169: 2@S shows clubs I am told...|pg||
nt|garnetts: 7@D not the nine too I think|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have just been advised that 2@S shows clubs too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and take your 5 tricks in the defence as soon  as possible|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||

nt|ralfwil: no @h ruff?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Exactly the wrong hand for an unusual nt in my opinion, but worked very well.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Maybe that's why they're playing and I'm watching.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|eamongall: Meanwhile EBU have passed the century deal|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a 50% 5@c will fail on a loosing @s finess|pg||
nt|eamongall: century imps total|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: H plays well|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but there is a good @h contract on EW|pg||
mb|2D|an|8-10 FG|nt|garnetts: Very little actually|pg||

mb|2S|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|garnetts: There is an issue with the alert system--sometimes it is a real alert and sometimes you do need to know|pg||

nt|ralfwil: was P on N correct?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: no x|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 2@D is more hearts...|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|mrt2000: straightforward 3NT|pg||
nt|viren169: now 2N=clubs?|pg||
nt|viren169: are they in GF now? or can it be dropped at the 3@H level?|pg||
nt|granguru: 2@c looks like a @D transfer|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 1 off here as like as not|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|santyclz: The lead suggests that 2@hs may have shown 2 suits such as @hs and a minor.|pg||
nt|granguru: so the lead is clear|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|granguru: around 10 tricks|pg||
nt|granguru: @Dk to maintain the lead!|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|nt|mrt2000: 11 now, perhaps|pg||
pc|dK|nt|viren169: It is nat and Invite now... with 6 hearts...|pg||
nt|viren169: I am sure West will be pleased to see a diamond or two in dummy!|pg||
nt|granguru: and cross @cs|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think East should bid 3@D after 2NT--but then again I am old fashioned why let partner know you have short hearts and a six card suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Once again. the whole highway open...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|viren169: still only 8 tricks available...|pg||
nt|eamongall: there is argueably 11 tricks available |pg||
nt|eamongall: @H and @S to lose|pg||
pc|h6|nt|garnetts: is it me or did a spade lead seem obvious here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but a careful play is needed. He doesn´t know that @hA is singleton|pg||

nt|Walddk3: A lot of if's, but if EBU can hold on to a lead around 40 (21-9), England must win the second half by 50 IMPs against Wales to win the Camrose Trophy. So EBU in a very strong ...|pg||
