nt|stewball: one of the worlds great pairs here in the Italians|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: in order: Fantoni, Nunes, Duboin, Lauria, Versace|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|petergill: A routine 3NT for EW here. |pg||
nt|stewball: inevitable 3nt|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@D is not a hopeless contract, but the club finesse doesn't work. |pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|stewball: maybe not so ineveitable|pg||
nt|stewball: E will have to raise @ds here surely|pg||
nt|petergill: West's heart holding of QJx strongly indicates to head for 3NT not for 5@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|othered1: 5@D possible spot.|pg||
nt|petergill: @H lead and low spade switch might set 5@D|pg||
nt|othered1: West has good @D but lots of secondary values|pg||
nt|stewball: that E hand has improved considerably|pg||
nt|stewball: but slam is very poor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for people with very good memories  Ron Gerard was Larry "the law" Cohen's first partner|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|petergill: South will have to decide whether to play a trump or a spade if he wins @HA at Trick 1|pg||
nt|stewball: and is now the laws biggest opponent|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S is dangerous|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@s = offer to play in the 5-2 fit, not a cue bid|pg||
nt|stewball: 4@s is a suggestion to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the link seems to be down right now, but if you want to see Convention Card and Supplementary notes for NS [aka fantunes]  scope out  http://www.ecatsbridge.com|pg||
nt|othered1: East did rebid 2@S, so I guess Qx is good enough to support at this late hour|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|petergill: East will not want to play 4@s with such poor texture in @S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That link is broken, Al|pg||
nt|stewball: neither has the juice to go past 5@d|pg||
nt|petergill: To play in a 5-2 fit, you want to have as many cards as possible of the K, Q, J and ten in the trump suit. |pg||
nt|othered1: Nothing left to do but 5@D|pg||
nt|petergill: West might think East is stronger than an 11 count. |pg||
nt|stewball: Feldman just doesnt have enuff i'm sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all of my bookmarks for ecats are failing right now :(|pg||
nt|othered1: Almost looks like east thought west showed better @S control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mine too|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: specs asking why 2@S rebid -- very common agreement is immediate 3@C rebid [known as High Reverse] promises extras|pg||
nt|stewball: well,i dont approve of this but its likely a partnership issue|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: lots of questioning on both sides of the screen|pg||
nt|stewball: its not as if it has no play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: this link works http://www.geocities.com/gerben47/conventioncards/fantoni-nunes.pdf    thanks to Dave Thompson|pg||
nt|petergill: @S7 would be an imaginative but not so good lead. |pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: I think Feldman is say ing 2NT could be min with 5 spades but not 5-3-3-2|pg||
nt|othered1: Another partnership issue.  How often they have to do with the cue-bid/preference issue.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: full gamut runs:  3@C just normal shape, 3@C always 5 but unknown size, 3@C extras w/4 or 5  3@C extras 5+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which is why old timers opened this hand 1@C :)|pg||
nt|stewball: i believe 4@s is universally non forcing|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: 2@S after game forcing 2/1 often says -- nothing :(|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|petergill: NS leads: low = even number without honour or odd number with honour|pg||
nt|petergill: NS leads: high pip = even with honour or odd number without honour|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: another question being asked by specs -- in WBF top 10 list -- who is 1st NON-Italian [hint  6 is not Italian, but  7 is Bocchi]|pg||
nt|stewball: to get a handle on the Italians style,check out Laurias 3nt bid on brd 33|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|an|4-5 hears; could have 4 spads if 4 heart|mb|p|nt|stewball: these guys leave NO clubs in their bags|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually Peter's link is to the WBF CC & Supplementary Notes -- just in different format|pg||
nt|stewball: i mean Versaces|pg||
nt|petergill: http://tinyurl.com/FNunes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=12-14 and can include many 5422 hands others wouldn't include|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or 6322 or even 4441|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C is attempt at thievery|pg||
nt|stewball: Fantoni is pre escaping 1nt|pg||
nt|petergill: The Ecatsbridge page where NS's Convention Card is kept is down, hence our back-up link|pg||
nt|stewball: and has caught both opps with in between hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a common [not uncommon] agreement over Weak NT - P - 2@C  is  DBL=points|pg||
nt|petergill: It is East who is thinking, not North|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: yes|pg||
nt|stewball: this is why many play a dbl of stayman here is simply any good hand|pg||
nt|stewball: like he said,,lol|pg||
nt|petergill: If screens are in use, we get N and E's bids together on BBO |pg||
nt|othered1: It can't be Fantoni thinking here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ron might be thinking --- why didn't i DBL first time :)|pg||
nt|petergill: I think E will dbl, then what will West do?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Gerard and Fantoni exchanging notes|pg||
nt|stewball: 2@h dbld would be most unpleasant|pg||
nt|stewball: 800 it seems|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni has been quite clever. Pretending that he has both majors|pg||
nt|stewball: its an old trick,see if EW can make them pay|pg||
nt|othered1: quite a tough decision for west.  Lots of inferences, perhaps -- they are vulnerable -- but taking out a takeout double often is right.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ironic situation -- isn't Ron Gerard one of the big players in ACBL Committee hearings?|pg||
nt|othered1: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: or was|pg||
nt|stewball: i'm sure theres no tempo issue at the table|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Fantoni writing the system over 2c -- just added a few lines "just to be complete"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope --- EVERYBODY knows Ron in the tank :)|pg||
nt|stewball: yet|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: I will but I will not likely see her for a while|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|stewball: the balance seems sort of obvious but bul vs not is rarely auto|pg||
nt|chip: W has a tough problem. P and lead a trump gets 800.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Nunes looking for a director|pg||
nt|stewball: now we have a tempo issue:)|pg||
nt|othered1: What's the inference of a slow double?   Balanced?  Light?  Otherwise imperfect?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, screens do not help here. Everyone knows that East was the one who tanked|pg||
nt|stewball: but Nunes simply looking to protect himself here,not pointing fingers|pg||
nt|stewball: he needs to call the director here not later|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: director is here but Nunes has not returned :)|pg||
nt|stewball: Fantoni i mean|pg||
nt|stewball: all of this looks sort of routine in the result|pg||
nt|stewball: gievn the auction|pg||
nt|stewball: given|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mark [Feldman] "logical choices" all depend upon what immediate DBL of 2@C would have been|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think|pg||
nt|stewball: he needs to react as if pard has a normal t/o dbl of 2@hs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now you know why Feldman's nickname is "Flash"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and NOT DBL of 2@C|pg||
nt|stewball: and i'm sure he will,,the problem is that is hand is so ambiguous...|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|stewball: so he took the middle of the road|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which is stronger hand -- ambiguous  or  non-descript|pg||
nt|stewball: i dont think any action by him would be subject to censure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this must go all pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very unlikely that 2N=pick a minor|pg||
nt|stewball: Gerard may bid 3....|pg||
nt|stewball: jsut to protect themselves,,,assuming 2nt wasnt t/o|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for full team roster, including player 1st name and country -- scope out  http://www.acbl.org/nabc/rosters/2009/01/VANDPRS/|pg||
nt|petergill: Was there a hesitation by West over 1NT? I didn't notice.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's beside the point. No-one knows when South bid 1NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Not that I noticed, esp given Feldman's tempo|pg||

nt|stewball: this is their style in both rooms|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no artificial strong opening  ---  1-suit = one-round force|pg||
nt|petergill: North has good intermediates, and the AK108 holding is worth more than 7 HCP, the ten backing up the AK in a long suit is a great card. |pg||

nt|petergill: The defence will have no problems getting their five tricks, with @CJ offside|pg||
nt|petergill: Recent data created on computers indicates that 24 HCP is plenty for a vul game at IMPs. |pg||
nt|chip: viewers suggest smith, but few play it when it is obvious we should lead another suit.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|petergill: 3NT is where you want to be, vul at IMPs, but the club finesse loses = bad luck. |pg||

nt|ahollan1: 52 seed really misleading -- 4 of players on China Open team|pg||

nt|petergill: China is sponsored by Longzhu Hospital in Shenzhen. This is one of many sponsors of the CCBA. Team 52 is two of the three best pairs in China. They are very good. |pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: our match is Cayne  2 v Sutherlin  23|pg||

nt|chip: A bit odd N didn't open. Seems unsystemic (2S= 10-13).|pg||
nt|ahollan1: terrible odds from Vegas --- nobody surprised if final = Nickell  1 vs Cayne  2|pg||
nt|stewball: @s now|pg||
nt|petergill: Adverse vulnerability sometimes scares them from bidding. |pg||
nt|stewball: often right to be passive on this type of hand,let declarer do his own work|pg||
nt|othered1: That's a pretty tough hand to bid out, too, with all of your values outside of your longish suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in early rounds of vugraph, ACBL tends to pick teams that will not be playing in late rounds  AND really likes close matches|pg||
nt|petergill: The three pairs in the China Open Team (team 52 and Fu - Jack) have a lot of training days in China - perhaps 50 such days a year, I think. |pg||
nt|othered1: They sort of go together -- the closest matches, chalk says, should be in the middle of the field.|pg||

nt|othered1: in dummy to take @S play?|pg||
nt|chip: declarer may assume that S has the D ace since N in theory denied 10 points and a heart void.|pg||
nt|petergill: @C2 discard was low encouraging, playing UDCA|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|petergill: @S6 was high discouraging - might help declarer place @SQ|pg||

nt|stewball: well N has to discard something|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|othered1: and now east is squeezed out of a winner|pg||
nt|petergill: North's pass helped North - he was marked with @CAQ and so less likely, being a passed hand, to have @DA. |pg||
nt|stewball: this sort of hand always tests declarers concentration|pg||
nt|stewball: the whole thing seems so futile|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||

nt|ahollan1: And to all of the spectators who keep us quasi honest|pg||
nt|petergill: BBO Scores are unofficial, e.g. Bd 45 is not 3@d EW at this table, it is 3@S by NS making perhaps 10 tricks. |pg||

nt|ahollan1: eventually ACBL will post Q3 results online -- http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2009/01/vanderbilt/|pg||
