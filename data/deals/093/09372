nt|viren169: yes...my mistake|pg||
nt|viren169: last one coming up!|pg||
nt|eamongall: Now I am told the board 21 is interesting ...lets see why |pg||
nt|eamongall: suppose its 6@Ds for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Eamonn I think its because it´s the last one and you want everybody to watch all boards|pg||
mb|3C|nt|eamongall: haha |pg||
nt|eamongall: 23 point slam |pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|viren169: Thanks to all especially the specs for correcting me!|pg||
nt|eamongall: they will be off 2 keycards if they can ask that |pg||
nt|sharkirl: but 3@D is a weak bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|viren169: E/W reached the dizzy height of 4@H in the other room!|pg||
nt|garnetts: There is a case for 2@C here by West|pg||
nt|garnetts: I certainly would try it|pg||
nt|viren169: and passing whtever response no doubt!|pg||
nt|eamongall: I am not going to do commentators curse|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: East is very optimistic after such a response|pg||
mb|p|pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: And after Ps 2@c?|pg||
nt|santyclz: I guess this doesn't mean "lead a @s" any more.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|starkist: 5@C was good save|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|starkist: going to make a lot|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mrt2000: who's doing the thinking here?|pg||
nt|granguru: In fact with a @d lead it also can be made|pg||
pc|s6|nt|garnetts: You can bid 2@H over 2@D and expect partner to bid 2@S with three spades and two hearts|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c5|nt|granguru: it is very against probabilities thou|pg||
nt|viren169: and with a 45xx shape?|pg||
nt|viren169: I would prefer pd to pass 2@H on that seq...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|santyclz: Perfect trumps for a high x-ruff, difficult with 4333 however.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: to avoid a crossruff in the defence, he must clean trumps|pg||
nt|eamongall: however Ireland finish with a win ...finishing with a win is good to quote rory boland |pg||
nt|eamongall: 17-13 victory to Ireland|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cK|nt|garnetts: AS Peter Goodman has argued that with the odd shapes that are opened 1NT these days it has risk attached |pg||
pc|h3|pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: clean trumps and take your 9|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|eamongall: EBU going to be the champions of Camrose for this year |pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|viren169: True... best to pass 2@D and take your chances!|pg||
nt|garnetts: You may be amazed to know I prefer to open 1NT with a balanced hand which excludes most 5-4-2-2 shapes and 6-3-2-2 shapes as well|pg||
nt|viren169: worse hand 3325 shape|pg||
nt|mrt2000: that's it from this table fir now.|pg||
nt|mrt2000: Hope everybody enjoyed it.  :)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: Bye for now.  Back for the second half shortly.|pg||

nt|eamongall: I don't play golf so unlikely|pg||

nt|mrt2000: bye folks, see you tomorrow, bright and early !!!!|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would too--in third seat with a four count at green |pg||

nt|vugraphzkn: hi|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|garnetts: There seems to me to be a difference between what I consider a weak jump overcall compared to some of the players--this is too strong!!|pg||
nt|granguru: looks like 3@Hs|pg||
mb|p|mb|r|nt|eamongall: kind of quiet here as the irelands have their annual bunfight|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: as the max NS can get|pg||
nt|mrt2000: might be tempted to bid to game here though|pg||
nt|sharkirl: Hi all & wecome|pg||
nt|sharkirl: Hi John|pg||
nt|granguru: Hi Michael|pg||
mb|2D|nt|viren169: Yes I agree...|pg||
nt|garnetts: Lets get this one out of the way--3@H is horrendous |pg||
nt|viren169: It has pushed E/W into a non-making contract...|pg||
nt|garnetts: a flat 6 count ---yuck|pg||
nt|garnetts: EW pushed themselves into it|pg||
nt|mrt2000: Hi Michael|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: Hi all|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Good evening Michael and Eamonn|pg||
pc|dA|nt|garnetts: Also North would have been well placed to express an opinion had hsi partner not advertised weakness|pg||
nt|viren169: The 3@C had the desired effect that South intended...|pg||
nt|garnetts: Problem is that North might have erroneously saved when it was going off|pg||
nt|viren169: true... however E/W may not have reached that high!|pg||
nt|eamongall: evening ralf|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharkirl: hi Paul|pg||
nt|mrt2000: should go 1 off, I think|pg||
nt|granguru: E is suspecting the worst |pg||
nt|sharkirl: very aggresive by Tommy|pg||
nt|granguru: agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Hi Michael|pg||
nt|granguru: S overrated the @SK|pg||
nt|mrt2000: seduced by his @D void|pg||

nt|granguru: hi all|pg||
nt|mrt2000: that's not right !!|pg||
nt|eamongall: andf the only Ralf I heard of was the racing drivers brother ...we got a few Eamons in Ireland |pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Looks like 5@h available e-w.|pg||
nt|eamongall: :):)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: NS fairly natural, EW strong club|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and a save in @s will cost 800 witn an optimal defence|pg||
nt|santyclz: And only 9 tricks in @ss or @cs for n-s.|pg||
nt|sharkirl: yes cross ruff|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|viren169: 1N by North assuming 1@D may be short?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Normal so far|pg||
nt|mrt2000: indeed so, sorry|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|granguru: would you bid  2@C?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@d-no 5-card major or 6-card minor|pg||
nt|granguru: I personally prefer to show 2-suited hands at once|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not any more|pg||
nt|garnetts: why 2@D on a balanced hand?|pg||
nt|sharkirl: h switch needed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes I´m very fast at the table but not on a racing course|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like a 3nt on EW|pg||
mb|2C|nt|viren169: Now is this dble take-out of diamonds or just a general value showing dbl?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|granguru: here N had an opportunity to show a great 6-5 hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but can you show the strength? |pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|viren169: pushy 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: It will get a result that is deserved--kiss of death at pairs|pg||
nt|mrt2000: not without its challenges, this one|pg||
nt|mrt2000: lead @H towards hand twice I suppose|pg||
nt|sharkirl: what system E/W|pg||
nt|eamongall: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/camroseteams.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: well - when playing ghestem michaels copenhagen or any other....normally you have an opportunity to show the great hand by bidding again|pg||
nt|santyclz: Any idea what 3@hs was?  Obviously not preemptive.|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|eamongall: convention cards there|pg||
nt|sharkirl: tks|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ralfwil: it was!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|viren169: kiss of death at imps if the red card had been applied!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a long and rather good @h|pg||
nt|santyclz: Wow.  Shades of the 1960s.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|garnetts: Lets hope they are just settling in|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: reckon 3@H was quite well judged - gave South the chance to bid 3N wiht good pointy-suit stops|pg||
nt|granguru: @H finesse  back with @CK and duck the @HK would have been the right play|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, he has nine on top|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|viren169: I think the 1st few hands shouldn't count 1st thing in the morning!|pg||
nt|viren169: Use it as a warm up session!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|garnetts: The 2@D was not just pointless but ill judged with such good diamonds--well suited to No-trumps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with @d 4-3 @sA mustn´t be on side|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s9|pc|c8|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@D-2 in the open room|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mrt2000: upto 8 tricks now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ralfwil: If E had 6-3 @d  the correct play is to cash @dA, but now it´s a little bit different|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|d4|pc|hT|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 2 @H tricks followed by @DA and another works|pg||

nt|garnetts: Here South also found a reason to bid 2@D--both South's got a deserved bad score|pg||
nt|viren169: Now onto a game... 4@S by E/W|pg||
nt|garnetts: This should be a routine 4@S in both rooms|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1@D the usual strong-club catch-all opener|pg||
nt|mrt2000: it's scored as making 3NT|pg||
nt|sharkirl: must be club discard & not Spade|pg||

nt|viren169: 10-11 with 4 card support|pg||
nt|viren169: most pairs now have reversed the 3@C and 3@D meaning to give you more room |pg||
nt|sharkirl: 3 losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: 2@S will probably be made...|pg||
nt|mrt2000: making 2 or 3 here, I suppose|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|mdgraham: West reckons he has an adequate spade stopper|pg||
nt|garnetts: Nearly bid it 1@S 3@S  4@S along with most of us :)|pg||
nt|viren169: David, what do you think of the Bergen convention?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As NS have 10 tricks in @c it´s ok with -1 (I guess -1)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now it will be interesting!|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: 3N looks pretty good|pg||
nt|granguru: still can go down if 1@S 2@H 2@D 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: should make 10 tricks|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Another thing to creat confusion---I hate it|pg||
nt|viren169: I know you are not a great fan of conventions! but they do keep a lot of people occupied for hours and hours!|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think my oppo should be made to use it|pg||
nt|viren169: playing for high stakes no doubt!|pg||
nt|garnetts: it works especially badly if playing 2/1 because it does not allow you develop middle range hands with a decent six card suit|pg||
nt|sharkirl: getting worse|pg||
mb|3S|nt|granguru: but hard that the defense get all their tricks|pg||
nt|granguru: 2@c and 1@H I meant|pg||
nt|sharkirl: make now!|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|granguru: declarer must err everything to lose this contract|pg||

mb|p|nt|mrt2000: the Open Romm went overboard, I see !!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: second highest from a bad suit - and, lets' face it, North's spade are prety bad   |pg||
nt|granguru: afraid of a @C ruff|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||

pc|c4|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|garnetts: It also allows the opps an extra way of getting in or gaining the lead|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|viren169: Yes that is true... most pairs have not discussed what dbl means in any depth? |pg||
nt|garnetts: It also is yet another thing to remember which clogs the brain for card play |pg||
nt|viren169: I agree... we need more books on card play rather than systems!|pg||
nt|garnetts: If the auction starts Say 1@H P 3@D you ccan now use 3@H for takeout and double to show a decent balanced hand |pg||
pc|c5|pc|d8|pg||

mb|1N|nt|ralfwil: What´s your opinion about 1@h on J10xxx?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: 5@D can be made if the singleton K is dropped offside|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Good bid by s.  Get out of 1nt before the xing starts.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a P over 2@cX had been better|pg||

nt|garnetts: 3@D shows shortage|pg||
nt|viren169: 3D is shortage agreeing spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: even 5@S can go down with the diamond ruff, which would be a bit unlucky|pg||
nt|viren169: maybe showing a void... there are other ways to show a singleton|pg||
nt|garnetts: I slso hope it shows a void not a singleton--there is an enormous qualitative difference|pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably a correct desicion from W|pg||
nt|sharkirl: with Dbl club lead|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 3NT would be a massacre here though!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: over Precision is reasonable|pg||
nt|eamongall: Mesbur will just grin at Walshe and get on with the next board|pg||
nt|ralfwil: My bid is to help partner not overturn|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: -2 if a good @D guess|pg||
pc|h3|nt|garnetts: Crucial when playing splinters that it shows a singlton not a void|pg||

nt|bobholl: but NS have a good save available in 6@S|pg||
nt|werge: 800, |pg||
nt|april7: a much better hand to open by W|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|werge: After 2 @S, the eventuel @H-guess is 100 %|pg||
nt|bobholl: S will take insurance :)|pg||
nt|april7: 6@D on a good @H guess|pg||
nt|bobholl: won't misguess after weak jump :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but will west trust his 6 small @D :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would open the west hand always (may be not in 4th)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|ady: 2H about limite    East will likely to bid to 3@D   one too high on a spade lead|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|bobholl: are you trusting your partner or opponents ?|pg||
nt|werge: Pass here is invitation from West|pg||
nt|bobholl: if partner invites and i have AKQ of trumps ??|pg||
nt|april7: E should bid 6@D after 5@C by W, where does W take this bid if not very strong and distributional, which he is only distributional|pg||
nt|bobholl: but what if we miss AK of @H ??|pg||
nt|werge: Then West had doubled!|pg||
nt|april7: can't be  missing 2 aces|pg||
nt|werge: Pass in an invit |pg||
nt|snorris: agree|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|april7: so W has only AK of @C??:):)|pg||
nt|werge: East knows, that partners opening bid is based og 17 HCP in @H and @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: now @H lead so no problems :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: who bid 6@S W or N ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: even without the @D J culbertson 21/2 honour trick :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|werge: undo pls|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bobholl: thats good insurance :)|pg||
nt|april7: good decision by W not to pass, because 2 @S makes on @C lead and 2 ruffs an 1 @H and 1 @S trick only 5|pg||
