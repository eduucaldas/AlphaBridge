nt|ehsana: but lose 4 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|rv: 2@h is a slight underbid, must be 4333 shape and white vul must have prompted Venky to go slow|pg||

nt|vugraphzsq: 3S for W|pg||
nt|vugraphzsq: losers is 2H, 2D nothing more|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|rv: with too much @s values, I prefer 1n to 2@c from his hand as well|pg||
