nt|kareno: 3@s was what - forcing?  Can't be invitational??|pg||
nt|vugraphztk: actually in closed room N and E misplaced cards..|pg||

nt|kareno: Good hand to stay low - no losers but also no winners!!  |pg||
nt|vugraphztk: 2@c should be 4+c@c and 4+c@d|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphu6: thanks for joining us Joe|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kareno: Also if east's bid shows minors, spades will be in west's hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: but did not|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mariner1: I don't like 3@H much and hate 5@C|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz: 3nt has some play here, an unlikely @c lead beats it.|pg||

pc|h7|nt|Vugraphu6: Lay:  no extras|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mariner1: this is an exercise in counting tricks..... if you just start playing you go off|pg||
nt|mariner1: so you have to hook the @D|pg||
pc|h6|nt|santyclz: In fact, I don't see how he can make more than 8 tricks without a little help from the defense.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|kareno: Diamond finesse pretty certain to win.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mariner1: right and now A@D and one|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|santyclz: Needed to play on @ds to have a chance.  |pg||
nt|santyclz: But a @c shift after winning the @d trick would still beat it 1.|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|kareno: Obviously north cannot set up spades after the auction.|pg||
nt|mariner1: timing wrong now|pg||
nt|kareno: He's in trouble.  |pg||
nt|mariner1: he needed to ruff a @D with 4@H|pg||
nt|kareno: heart back should be clear.|pg||
nt|mariner1: E showed both minors, and led a @S, which means he has some trumps so likely|pg||
nt|mariner1: only 1@S,,,,,,,,,,,,,|pg||

nt|mariner1: BBO tv and our posted contracts do not match it seems|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: 4@h a bit optimistic.. how about double?  If partner hasn't got spades you could be in trouble.|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|nt|mariner1: maybe 4@H meant as two places to play|pg||
nt|kareno: Dummy will be a happy sight for south.|pg||

nt|santyclz: In theory it's makeable.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|santyclz: The @c9x allows declarer to get out with 1 @c loser, so it's a matter of guessing @ss and playing for that.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|d8|pg||
