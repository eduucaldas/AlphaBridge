mb|p|nt|paperika: guess this is the previous hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Test|pg||
nt|rodal f: A back|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|lml: I don't much like the 2@C bid or the double|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: 2@C is ok at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|paperika: hi all|pg||
pc|sK|nt|buffytvs: but I agree on the dbl|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugrapha3: Welcome back to the excited conclusion of the tournament|pg||
nt|rodal f: And also hi for Ercy from Switzerland:) Nice to see u back:)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|buffytvs: neg dbls should be resreved for hands with no other sensible bid, not used as a wide range 'I have the oerh 2 suits'|pg||
nt|lml: I would rather bid 3@C|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|kastan88: Hi all Australia from dark side of Earth (Estonia)!|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|buffytvs: what's wrong with 2@H (unless that's nf)?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Sorry! i forgot East.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are 5@H on so a nice sac EW for 10?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|paperika: singleton, holding singleton trump is often not a very good idea|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rodal f: I live in Norway Jaak. And sunny as.........|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: Hi all. Then back for 3. session|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Welcome back Rodal. |pg||
nt|rodal f: A lucky breake if Gill find it.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Matt:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Hopefully we have a better connection for the next two rounds. |pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Jaak:)|pg||
nt|paperika: 3 aces from the top and something more maybe. they open really light|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. And 3NT have the same promblem by an @H lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: So next.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|lml: Burgess might have doubled after his partner bid 2@C|pg||
nt|lml: but I suppose that is a bit aggressive.  It would have worked though|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|rodal f: The web page for the turney are: http://www.northshore.bridge-club.org/|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Please hang on for a few minutes.. we are playing the same boards as yesterday...|pg||
nt|kastan88: and I remember after 3rd segment there was 76-72 score on table, what is right?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Else we have the 2 topranked teams from the beginning      at the final|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: The scores are right now.. in the third round, the carry-over scores were inputted wrong before that session|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we say 2 off? Can be 1|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Ok, we are being given a new set of boards and we are going ot set the files up now|pg||
nt|rodal f: THX Matt. So the spec at last session was right|pg||
nt|kastan88: tx Matt for clearing situation|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: OK, we are closing the event and restarting in 5 minutes! |pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|paperika: hi everyone |pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: Re for the web page at the turney: http://www.northshore.bridge-club.org/|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rodal f: We will get some exstra help from a lady in a min or 2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|cK|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Ercy:)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|buffytvs: so this will drift one down eventually...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice to see u.|pg||
nt|paperika: hi frank|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we see a small @C from N|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i think its big pauses in the game that are timing me out.. |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: this result looks normal enough -1|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s4|pc|h6|nt|kastan88: all troubles starting here from North too weak opening 1@C here, i would open 3@C if this possible for NS, then no problem with strong partner, and can't overbid this actual time|pg||

nt|henryb: TY|pg||
nt|stew: hi|pg||
nt|kareno: Fred :)  Henry :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: hi Gang|pg||
nt|kareno: JoAnna :)  So it is really John playing with Arnie?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: n-s discussing flannery defense (played by e-w)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: yep:  John and Arnie|pg||
nt|kareno: Fred Hamilton's health has been iffy for the past few years.  I hope nothing's wrong with him today.|pg||
nt|stew: Will richie start off with a preempt ... probably|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: is there some New York history you want to share?|pg||
nt|henryb: John plays with anybody; forty years ago he even played with me|pg||
nt|reisig: my guess is 3@c |pg||
nt|kareno: Sort of a shaggy suit, but there are seven of them.|pg||
nt|reisig: Schwartz team is 4 handed ..so we always know who's playing :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|stew: or not|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: please welcome PO Sundelin|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||
nt|henryb: Many of the good young players in NY had animal nicknames in the sixties: the snail, the antelope, the hopper ...|pg||
nt|kareno: Hm.. interesting decision by Schwartz to start this set.|pg||
nt|reisig: welcome dear PO :)|pg||
nt|henryb: the Pipe|pg||
nt|po-s: calling all passengers, this is a test|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Sorry, my bad....    all great players look alike, that sort of thing.   Hopper playing with Swanson|pg||
nt|kareno: The Whale being perhaps the best known of them.|pg||
nt|po-s: it worked|pg||
nt|kareno: PO :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|kareno: This is the last 15 board segment of the match between Larsen and Kasle with Kasle in the lead by 20 IMPs. |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|kareno: Ahhh.. backing up, here's Richie again!|pg||
nt|po-s: anyway, it is comforting to know that EW have enough methods to create a discussion for NS|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: I have keyboard entry for bids and plays, and occasionally I start to type a chat and it displays as an unusual bid/play, I will try to watch that|pg||
nt|kareno: Paul Swanson most likely will raise to game here.|pg||
nt|reisig: Fisher became someone else,,,as we all suspected|pg||
nt|po-s: he sat in for the shuffling|pg||
nt|henryb: really? I think he has barely enough to raise to four opposite a balance|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: I was so mesmerized by the etymology of grasshoppers...|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, good - that allays any fears about Freddy.|pg||
nt|kareno: Or entomology :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu8: better|pg||
mb|p|nt|stew: 5 will make ... might not have gottin had south bid his spades|pg||
nt|reisig: 2@s end|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|kareno: Well, the etymology of nicknames anyway :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Please welcome Valerie Westheimer who will fill us in on all the nicknames :)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hi|pg||
nt|reisig: same auction at other table ...but Granovetter declined and Passed 4@d|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: But I do fear there wld be too many|pg||
nt|kareno: Valerie :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: :)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|vdoubleu: It would be a major distraction, but here, with 5@d being cold...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|reisig: Hi Val :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Ira Rubin= The Beast|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|h3|nt|stew: in fact, Karen ... back in the days of Paul and Bernie there were a lot of Fish ... the whale , minnow, guppy etc|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Billy Eisenberg=The Duck|pg||
nt|po-s: Does John have another name? Nick I mean|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: starting to sound like a zoo..|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: No:)|pg||
nt|henryb: and the Herring|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Paul Trent=Baby Beast|pg||
nt|kareno: Actually ruffs are not what Casen wants on this hand.  He'd have preferred a diamond shift.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|vdoubleu: Jeff Westheimer= The Pipe|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: It was a zoo, a fuill menagerie|pg||
nt|kareno: It's IMPs!!  Even nonvul games have a bonus|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|vdoubleu: Norman Kurlander=The Ant|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kareno: North can't get out of his own way.  Now declarer can finesse the club, ruff a club and take the heart finesse.  |pg||
pc|c2|nt|stew: good result|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Swanson:  Partner, I wanted to pass.    Solodar:  I had the right singleton|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: OK, enough w/the names:)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kareno: Hm.. east sort of needed that club to ruff his way back to dummy.|pg||
mc|7|nt|kareno: So it seems like the personnel in this room aren't who we thought they were :)|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|lml: Gill almost didnt score in the first segment so it would be nice to get something on the scoreboard|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugrapha3: they don't play standard minor openings|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|kastan88: but sure , this depends from agreements about 3@C opening, may be they play destructive preempts|pg||
nt|rodal f: Page well wourth to bookmark. Then u always get the web pages for the turneys at BBO: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|lml: the clubs did look kind of attractive but I would lead a heart myself|pg||
nt|buffytvs: normal lead, but not one that will strike fear into the heart of declarer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: heart lead is Trick 7 right there|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: And we have the two top ranked team at the finale as I can see. Look at: http://www.nswba.com.au/tourn/res.asp?yr=2009&dir=congress/nssc&E=0&R=3&T=I|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: are Burgess-Prescott playing a natural system??|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|kastan88: watching from here, from Dark side of Earth (Estonia), seems that Australians opening all 10-11 points hands usually :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: think this always makes in fact|pg||
nt|lml: I think after he ducked the club he might have gone done|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both have long history with Moscito -- Prescott has his own Modified Polish -- so the settled on Acol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oy|pg||
nt|rodal f: And here u are the web for this turney: http://www.northshore.bridge-club.org/|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|buffytvs: yes -- diamond shift then.  Tough to find|pg||
nt|lml: yes but the duck by declarer was a mistake|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lml: maybe thats harsh|pg||
nt|lml: he doesn't know the @HA is onside|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||

nt|robinswr: my guess is that he overtook the spade and led clubs from dummy and guessed diamonds|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|kareno: Just two more - Paul Heitner was the whale and Jeff Rubens was the snail for obvious reasons :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Oh ofc Karen:)|pg||
nt|henryb: the one they will probably find splits 5-1|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Roger Stern=The Snail|pg||
mb|2H|an|transfer|mb|p|nt|robinswr: since the opponents points had to be divided 10-10 aprox|pg||
mb|2N|nt|henryb: No, Karen, Roger Stern was the snail|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: that makes 2 snails?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|kareno: Oh, was he?  What was Jeff's nickname then?|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: You had to play against Roger to fully appreciate his name:(|pg||
nt|kareno: He was also a slow player.|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: I have a nickname for my friend PO ...but I'll leave it out :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Did Neil Chambers miscount his hand or are they playing a range that's not standard?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|robinswr: some pairs would rebid 1nt with the north hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|henryb: Jeff was not in the same class; the antelope was, though|pg||
nt|kareno: I must say, I would not raise clubs with Solodar's hand.|pg||
nt|henryb: Nor I|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: I think you New Yorkers are a very rough crowd.   Glad I am on the left coast|pg||
nt|stew: agree... I do not like the raise with only 4 trump|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|reisig: I never raise when they split 5-1|pg||
nt|kareno: And a spade void does not improve the hand.|pg||
nt|henryb: On the other hand, whenever partner has real clubs you might have a game|pg||
nt|stew: trump shift looks right |pg||
nt|kareno: Richie, ever the pragmatist!|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||
nt|stew: can't let declarer score his small ones|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: at the other table:   system is 1N nf.    E must pass W 1N because 2m would be canape|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: and i would have raised diamonds with schwart's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: i think after 1club - 1dia - 1heart Double by east is a T/o double of 1diamnd|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|henryb: at least it is not a violation of Burn's Law, although a violation of the corrollary|pg||
nt|kareno: Pronounced in the British way, no doubt :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|robinswr: quick 130|pg||
nt|pef: karen, you look lonely, so I've been asked to join you|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, they are in a comfortable 4@s.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|henryb: Burn's law: have more trumps than the opponents|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|kareno: Two demerits, JoAnna!|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kareno: Thank you Peter :)  Did you note south's opening bid.  Do you think he missaw his hand?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|henryb: The corrollary: do not play when an opponent has more trumps than you |pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
nt|reisig: they reach 4@s (EW) in Open rm|pg||
mc|11|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|rodal f: Belive we will see an end at 4@S.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can it be Ekren's 2@D?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|nt|rodal f: Min 44 in majors|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: explained as could be 4-4 in majors|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|lml: interesting in the other room they doubled 4@h on that first hand on the same auction|pg||
nt|lml: as we discussed|pg||
nt|buffytvs: as you suggested|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: Thx Erin:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: A balance to come?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c3|nt|paperika: better to not be gredy|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c4|nt|paperika: wise play|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|nt|kastan88: 4@S for NS if just find out @DQ, 3NT the same thing with @H lead, but now just easy if spades 32|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|rodal f: That was passive by Prescott. But he are normaly better then me|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|rodal f: Better take ure last trick in @H I belive.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kastan88: So in real NS is Gill team and EW is Dyke, so pls read scores 10:3 for Gill|pg||
nt|kastan88: ducking @C sets up squeeze situation for 10th trick, |pg||
pc|cK|pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: it doesnt matter, she should've just claimed !|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s6|pc|h8|nt|buffytvs: quiet start to the set though|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Good no 2@c overcall here, right|pg||
nt|po-s: team Morsedid equally bad 2 down in 2 and 3 down in 3|pg||
nt|robinswr: only 14 with bad distribution? |pg||
nt|reisig: This table won't be slow|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|robinswr: lots of points here but no fit|pg||
nt|pef: no, given that 2h was a transfer to spades, which is unusual, I bet they play 2c is 19+ or something like that.  I'll check|pg||
mb|p|nt|stew: when both sides play same suit something wrong|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: 2@c, not advisable w/only 5|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vdoubleu: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: And a moth-eaten suit to say the least|pg||
nt|stew: 4H does make|pg||
nt|po-s: will the Hopper support?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|stew: and will be bid 6-4|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Schwartz thinking here|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: This wld be a really good game to get to--for E/W|pg||
nt|po-s: he imagines short hearts in South|pg||
nt|stew: Paul will surely bid it Red and all those primes + 6-4|pg||
nt|henryb: I do not understand 3@d. |pg||
mb|d|nt|Vugraphu8: I believe that is so|pg||
mb|2D|nt|po-s: and nobody will double|pg||
nt|robinswr: good to play 2nt forcing here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|stew: great result for schwartz  |pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Jones (seeing you dummy)  You're an animal.   3@D showed by worst possible hand.  Pass would be stronger|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks, Bob ... I don't know their system but I'm betting THEY do :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: one more try|pg||
nt|robinswr: he hasn't shown his 17 but it is a misfit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|reisig: OK ..he did his job|pg||
nt|robinswr: if he's thinking its an overbid|pg||
nt|reisig: 4NT means ...whatever happens now ..is your fault, pard!|pg||
nt|kareno: crfvtgbyp,l.;/[']|pg||
nt|kareno:  "? ><lpkgbvcfxdezswacfvrgtnjmkl/|pg||
nt|pef: however they play 1nt as 15+ - 18- so that doesn't leave much room for opening 1 and jumping to 2nt, does it?|pg||
nt|kareno: Oops - blame the cat for that one!!|pg||
nt|kareno: That'|pg||
nt|kareno: That's why I'm confused about their auction.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: I played them yesterday and they were double dummy|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pef: was that "cattish", karen?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|kareno: Stansby's doubles showed primary clubs and the second was definitely takeout of diamonds.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|robinswr: he'll make 6 now|pg||
nt|pef: looks like down 2-3 to me|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|reisig: no @c lead is 6 too|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|pef: now probably duck a spade|pg||
pc|dK|nt|robinswr: the heart spots are good to take 4 tricks|pg||
pc|d6|nt|reisig: oops ...no entry to West :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: 9 of hearts|pg||
pc|s2|nt|reisig: Better!|pg||
nt|kareno: I have three cats and every so often one decides to do some data entry :)|pg||
nt|pef: ah cat dancing on the keyboard|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|reisig: welcome PO :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, but not the original piano keyboard :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|stew: so much for my prognostication|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Schwartz saying the agreement about pass=interest doesn't apply here.  and he doesn't like being called an animal|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes, most play that bidding is the weaker of the actions there.|pg||
nt|henryb: It was a great result; just a greater one for Morce and Wolffe|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: big argument:  Jones:  I am trying to follow your methods.   Schwartz:  you are so crazy it is beyond belief|pg||
nt|po-s: little did Jones know...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Schwartz:  so we beat them easy....   Jones:  let's play bridge.  |pg||
nt|kareno: Fabulous - a saving over even a heart partscore.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|robinswr: should have led the 9 of hearts|pg||
nt|reisig: not possible ..he played @h Q|pg||
nt|po-s: or unblocked|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kareno: The ten will be a call for hearts.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|pef: i would have thought it better to duck a spade, getting spade ruff later and then hoping for one more trick in the end position for down 2|pg||
nt|kareno: The king would have shown spade preference.|pg||

nt|kareno: Henry, I overcall with that hand.|pg||
nt|stew: true Karen ... the question might be how high|pg||
nt|robinswr: only way to beat this is a diamond lead then lead the 2 from Q2 of clubs  and have declarer misguess |pg||
mb|4D|nt|henryb: why? wouldn't you either bid 2@c with W, or 1N perhaps?|pg||

nt|Vugraphu8: if Schwartz switches, there will be some big fireworks  (and we already had 4th of July)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: jones assumed that west had a stopper so he wanted a spade shift and therefore discouraged|pg||
nt|stew: Jones was expecting Q and one|pg||
nt|stew: but if Richie switches Declarer might play the long diamond hand for short clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: I bet Fred nailed it...so will go down 3 instead of 1|pg||
nt|robinswr: once you make an assumption (west has a stopper) it's hard to undo the assumption |pg||
nt|robinswr: but if south was 4351, he would have doubled 1club|pg||
nt|kareno: Clearly|pg||

nt|ahollan1: even for the players :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|pef: make it stiff heart and doubleton club and then I wouldn't force|pg||
mb|p|nt|stew: hi Gene|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd seat -- Drew could do anything here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu8: welcome Gene (we all know you have excellent Hy-giene"|pg||

nt|reisig: 5@s is a good save :)|pg||
nt|daman: THAT was a strong weak 2|pg||

mb|1D|nt|vdoubleu: lol|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: We have to take the good with the bad:)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i wouldn't be surprised if MSC got some votes for each of 1/2/3/4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Well forcing would be much more likely to get you to slam.|pg||
nt|pef: at any rate, 4s appears to be the best game|pg||
mb|1S|nt|robinswr: the doubleton club says yes|pg||
nt|reisig: Nice bid Sonty|pg||
nt|daman: they better get their ruff|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: ugh|pg||
nt|ahollan1: protection against misdefense :(|pg||
nt|daman: 6@C was not on my radar|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how likely do you think @C lead from Onstott?|pg||
nt|daman: some players are devoid of green cards|pg||
nt|ritong: one down versus one down with a perfect lead looks like the right decision|pg||
nt|ritong: hi guys|pg||
mb|2C|nt|robinswr: east must have thought 2clubs was majors|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: 2@C was alerted by East "out loud"|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: North requests future alerts in writing|pg||
nt|daman: Salut Henri|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: 2@h promises ...how many @hs?|pg||

nt|reisig: Henri!!   Nice to see ya :)|pg||
nt|daman: hard to say|pg||
nt|ritong: hey buddy:)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|gff: issn't two diamnds enuf? why 3 clubs  by Solodar?|pg||
nt|robinswr: out loud is a clear violation|pg||

nt|gff: zorry cant csnt p;lsy 2 hesrts|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: director on the way|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Director here now|pg||
nt|robinswr: i guess the only reason east would bid 2hearts is if he was 5-6 in the reds so therefore 3diamonds is a possibility |pg||
nt|reisig: The only thing I say out loud ..."need a bathroom break"|pg||
nt|robinswr: same here|pg||
nt|stew: and in the seniors they are needed far more frequently|pg||
nt|robinswr: i place the alert card on the bid until my opponent tells me to take it off|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Swanson says:  I did alert outloud as Stayman, but I don't think anyone heard.   Turns out Jones says it was also alerted as Stayman on his side of screen (I didn't see it)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: so apparently no problem, since both alerted as Stayman|pg||
nt|kareno: If you're going to bid game :)|pg||
nt|pef: bates and sontag did get to 4s, so this could take the match back to even if they don't reach game here (and bates-sontag make 4s, of course|pg||
nt|stew: 1Diamond seems fine to me|pg||
nt|pef: seems like any reasonable line allows you to make 4s if you get there|pg||
nt|kareno: Could get dicey.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|stew: Well!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: down 1 not vul seems like good insurance against possible vul 5@S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|robinswr: some play 3diamonds invitational but NF can be passed if the raise was 3-card |pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: don't understand the trump lead since dummy could be void in clubs|pg||
nt|robinswr: and you're supposed to lead low from 2 when leading trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Kib has a good Question,  so why not bid 2@S after 2@H|pg||
nt|kareno: I certainly would have led a plain suit, not a trump.|pg||
nt|kareno: It may not have occurred to John Solodar.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: how do they find 4-4 spade fit??|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Rare jump on only two trumps.  Two rounds of diamonds and a heart could cause a problem.  But the clubs are friendly..|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: I think 2H was transfer to spades|pg||
nt|stew: aha   now that makes sense|pg||
nt|kareno: Then 3@s makes sense.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: i stand corrected|pg||
pc|c2|nt|robinswr: i've seen situations where you lead top and later you would have been able to overruff with it|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|s2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|robinswr: setting up the cross ruff before drawing trumps|pg||
nt|robinswr: he might need to ruff the 4th diamond and the club in dummy|pg||

mb|3S|nt|kareno: For this hand, I propose a break for a cup of tea ... (_)? ... and a few cookies ... OOO.|pg||
nt|robinswr: 2diamonds was probably some sort of drury and 2hearts shows an opening bid|pg||
nt|kareno: Not much interest other than staying out of slam :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I think they use 3- and 4-card drury, useful with four-card majors.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: the defense to 4@S (last hand) might have a shot if West ducks first trump, and then sees trump suit pref ....may be able to switch to heart away from Queen|pg||
nt|barnets: might x 5D|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: trouble looming if he doubles|pg||

nt|ahollan1: if you are good at multi-tasking you can watch all four table using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||

pc|s2|nt|stew: this will be only the second push of the set|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: table taking a short break|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: unlikely (last hand) for E to give suit pref for hearts...   defense may need a club ruff to beat the hand|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||

nt|Vugraphu8: time for panel vote:  1N or 1minor (which?)|pg||
nt|robinswr: seems like a normal defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good run from the penalty dbl|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: John and Drew discussing their methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: North's hand a fairly normal 1NT even with 5-4.  Not good enough to reverse.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: i vote 1nt|pg||
nt|kareno: I would not invite at IMPs with that west hand.  I just biddum game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: morst invited in the OR and wolff rejected|pg||
mb|1C|nt|daman: 4@H is on for NS  but 4@S is a useful sacrifice for EW|pg||
nt|kareno: Splinter most likely as most descriptive.|pg||
nt|kareno: You can't be that fine-tuned.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kareno: And 1NT has a certain preemptive value also.|pg||
nt|stew: it's hard to make up if you don't open a NT ... same shape with 5M and I wouldn't however|pg||
nt|ahollan1: drew in 3rd seat with 6@H -- where have we seen that before|pg||
nt|daman: they must play super weak 2 bids in 3rd and 4th seats|pg||
nt|daman: my Mom would open that 1@H|pg||
nt|pef: yep, I agree, just too many minimums produce a game|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Vugraphu8: how about if 5@D and 4@C??|pg||
nt|robinswr: why wouldn't you not lead a spade on the last hand|pg||
mb|4H|nt|barnets: with 2 spades declarer has 0 or 1 probably|pg||
nt|stew: when the hand that is inviting has shape the high road tends to be best ... partner simply can't asses his values|pg||
nt|pef: pretty ugly 1h overcall. hard to fault chambers for bidding 4h, but this will be a swing back to the larsen team|pg||
nt|kareno: Also opener has poor trumps, which can make the decision harder for him.|pg||
nt|pef: such language, fred :)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|pef: wow!|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Then I open 1@d|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: In the OR Granovetter, in the play, pitched a club on the last dimaond, S\so Wolff guess the clubs to make 2NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: I still open 1N...want to shut out their majors|pg||
nt|robinswr: you could open 1diamond and rebid 2clubs on  this hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: would you, Steve?|pg||
nt|stew: I would also still open 1NT|pg||
nt|robinswr: but i would open 1nt|pg||
nt|pef: bigger swing than I thought here, this looks like it will make, but some handling problems|pg||
nt|kareno: I can't imagine Stansby has anything to think about!|pg||
mb|p|nt|stew: I think trump lead defeats this  just cant handle it|pg||
nt|kareno: Spade would present problems.  He may well make this on the expected heart lead.|pg||
mb|d|nt|robinswr: lead the king of hearts and find J10xxx of hearts in dummy and the club ace|pg||
nt|barnets: there will be time to get the spade trick unless dummy has very strong clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i bet Bart Bramley also treats this hand differently than Drew|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Yes, you could - and I used to do that, but now prefer 1nt|pg||
nt|barnets: could be thats why leads are so difficult for everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: i open 1nt whenever possible|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: me too!|pg||
nt|stew: so here we are|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Pushy 3NT here:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: in the open room no stayman so wolff was worried about his hearts|pg||
nt|kareno: North likes his five-card club suit.  He will have to play anti-field to make it.|pg||
nt|kareno: Trump, he wins and plays a heart.  I think it makes with a trump lead.|pg||
nt|pef: well it's 13 imps if he make this|pg||
nt|kareno: Or, as a spec points out, draw trumps, concede a diamond and get on to the next hand.|pg||
nt|stew: that 10 third of trump is hugh I think.  not enough communicatioin to set up the diamonds and not enough trump to ruff all the loosers and get back and forth|pg||
pc|s6|nt|robinswr: right|pg||
nt|pef: I think a spade lead is actually best|pg||
nt|stew: yes  I was wrong (frequently) trump lead he can claim   the spade though is great for NS|pg||
nt|kareno: Tough hand now.  May not be able to make on this lead.|pg||
nt|kareno: Duck spade for sure.|pg||
nt|pef: duck the spade and south wins and returns a trump seems to beat it|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks right to me to duck the spade..|pg||
pc|s7|nt|stew: but I don't think he will|pg||
nt|kareno: Spade out is tougher as I said.|pg||
nt|stew: great lead|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Vugraphu8: that old rule of eleven....|pg||
nt|stew: he knows he's in a pushy game so will take the percentage line|pg||
nt|robinswr: its not anti field its anti percentage|pg||
nt|kareno: I doubt he'll bring it in unless he is playing totally for a swing here (possible).|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, both.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hT|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kareno: He makes the percentage play and that's that.|pg||
nt|robinswr: but you run 4diamonds and look around|pg||
nt|robinswr: very easy when you're looking at all the hands to make the correct lead|pg||
nt|reisig: might go down here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: boom|pg||
nt|stew: Wow  now does have a claim|pg||
nt|kareno: Surely the nine of diamonds is fatuous.|pg||
nt|pef: now it's easy|pg||
pc|c9|nt|barnets: s|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|barnets: same lead in other room|pg||
nt|barnets: west overtook and playd spade|pg||
nt|stew: the match will be really tight now|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|stew: he shouldn't play anti percentage after getting to 3NT that was anti percentage enough|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: That's what he did, in OR|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|kareno: But he had help with a club pitch from west.|pg||
nt|ritong: not much he couyld do after south correctly ducked two rounds of trumps|pg||

pc|c8|nt|robinswr: not if fisher wins the first heart trick|pg||
nt|robinswr: he obviously ducked the heart lead|pg||
nt|robinswr: did jones play 4hearts correctly?|pg||
nt|robinswr: he could afford to lose 2hearts and a spade|pg||
nt|reisig: not to me|pg||
nt|robinswr: i guess they could still get a diamnd ruff|pg||

nt|kareno: Specs, are you enjoying this?  It's exciting bridge.|pg||
nt|pef: 3nt was not a happy contract in the open room|pg||
nt|pef: 6 board to go, 6 imps difference|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Not here in the virtual world, of course, so the superstition needs to stay where it is!!|pg||
nt|robinswr: i would|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, this is now a six-board match with six imps difference.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 1@S limited by failure to open 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: after 1 heart - 2hearts, jones should make a game try by bidding 4hearts|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||
nt|pef: 2d is not a weak 2 bid for chambers/schermer so that option wasn't available|pg||
nt|kareno: Good result for Kasle in the OR|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kareno: Jones opens the lead-inhibiting 1@d :)  North's is showing both majors.|pg||
nt|robinswr: and he picked off their 8-card fit|pg||
nt|kareno: I would too - we were discussing this yesterday and Henry Bethe said, it's an old-fashioned double, showing suppport for four suits :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N Semi-F|pg||
mb|d|nt|vdoubleu: Does anyone open 1@d here?|pg||
nt|pef: they have 26 highs between them, but 3nt by north is doomed by the cards|pg||
nt|pef: bart's double may keep them out of trouble|pg||
nt|kareno: This could be the wrong moment for Bart Bramley to enter the auction..|pg||
nt|pef: or at least get 3nt played by south, which is a far better spot and might even make|pg||
nt|pef: the lucky lie in clubs (for e/w) means that 2s doesn't get destroyed here|pg||
mb|r|nt|kareno: Looks like a convention hiccup.|pg||
nt|po-s: North tried to show majors|pg||
nt|kareno: I open 1@c.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Jones also alerted 2@C|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes, EW had the same problem a few boards back:(|pg||
nt|stew: no I think Jones just decided to settle for what might be the best spot in his eyes|pg||
nt|kareno: In this auction (1 minor/1nt) I use two of partner's minor to show both majors.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Brd 2|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Vugraphu8: Jones:  sorry I took a shot|pg||
nt|stew: best lead|pg||
nt|robinswr: i open 1diamond with 4-4 in the minors|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: As we are seeing, the most important thing is to be on the same page w/partner.|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't try to outguess the cards - if it is Stayman, I bid 2@s with the south hand.|pg||
nt|robinswr: they were it seems|pg||
nt|robinswr: what |pg||
nt|stew: Stansby running for his life   |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|robinswr: yes|pg||
nt|reisig: whew|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: in the other match    Lynch is leading Vernay   93-46|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless Stansby overcalls 2@D - we should see same auction in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: if all you need is for partner to have the king of clubs, for a play for game, then bid it|pg||
nt|kareno: Gulp|pg||
nt|pef: chambers did well to forget about the result on the previous hand and pass 3cx|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kareno: Good trump lead by Swanson.  Will he continue?|pg||
nt|stew: I think the defense can still prevail, but West must shift to the hearts when next in|pg||
nt|po-s: declarer could make if clubs 33 and heart queen on side if he tries for a D ruff. This way it seems difficult|pg||
nt|stew: assuming Schwartz continues working on spades|pg||
nt|pef: and this does look pretty bloody on a heart lead|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|kareno: On any lead!  Including a and q of clubs|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|pef: this may get back more than they lost on the previous board|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kareno: The only good news for Larsen's team is that both sides have bad results on the same board, reducing the impact.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|barnets: he has the luxury of club safety play|pg||
pc|s2|nt|po-s: Def get in three times - the trumps in North are gone - many diamond tricks available|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  expect same auction|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: and Bates now knows @C hook is losing and @HA onside|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what can he do with that info?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|barnets: CA and one to th 9|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|pef: 15 imps or so is a lot of impact regardless!|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, north can't really duck that spade.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kareno: Heart finesse would lead to big disappointment for declarer!|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|robinswr: he needs it to make|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: But what else can he do here|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: He is clocked for -1 if he does not finesse.|pg||
nt|kareno: Cash out.|pg||
nt|po-s: take another ruff|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Martin -- i missed @C spots|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamond might be best.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kareno: With a spade - maybe they won't notice :)|pg||
nt|stew: Schwartz may get only his 2 trump now|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: :) Karen|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Let us not be insulting:)|pg||
nt|stew: and yet another big pickup for Morse|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Swanson pulls out a diamond, puts it back|pg||
nt|kareno: A lot of pressure on north this trick.  |pg||
nt|stew: he'll duck |pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|stew: trick comes back if he looses to stiff J|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||

mb|p|nt|buffytvs: was that really intedned as penalty?  Assuming partner had a heart stack?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Always forgiven my son:) Lol|pg||
mb|d|nt|kastan88: 12th brd surprising 10 IMPs for Dyke, as Peter Gill managed to bid twice his 5-card spades, tho Closed Room EW landed in 4@S, and against bad trump break , that was just down|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: he has no where near enough to double again|pg||
nt|lml: it was takeout|pg||
nt|lml: but it shows a much better hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: From the book.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: But might a sac in 5@D|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Dyke looks like he's bridged out!|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I think North should have bid over the second double|pg||

nt|lml: not exactly|pg||
nt|lml: he expected them to go down|pg||
nt|lml: he didn't know for sure if they made 5@D|pg||

nt|buffytvs: better keep playing diamonds...|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Lazer knows this is making. he just showed "the look"|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can be he are right|pg||

nt|lml: to lose thats 3|pg||

mb|p|pc|h3|nt|ritong: wow|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: This just in from CNN:  We think Morse still leading |pg||
pc|hA|nt|vdoubleu: This might be a push:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Swanson:  play hard partner, play hard.|pg||
nt|ritong: pretty aggressive double|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N has good play here|pg||
nt|daman: I'm a passer|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pef: a peaceful 9 tricks it would appear, unless chambers take the double spade finesse and makes a peaceful 10 tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|stew: doesn't seem to be many tricks for either side, but I think defense will prevail|pg||
nt|kareno: I usually say, "don't relax" :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: sontag really does not want to leave them alone in a raised major suit|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well you had a chance to pass out the hand -- now letting them play in 2@S with 8+ fit seems defeatist|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|barnets: declarer has 9 tricks just has to find a way to get them|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|daman: -110 mis much better than -200|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|kareno: I'm not with the crowd here - I pass 1@d with the east hand.|pg||
nt|pef: so perhaps 8 imps back to larsen in this ping pong match, or about a vul. game swing difference with 4 boards to go|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|pef: hmm, so much for that prediction on how many tricks he's making :)|pg||
nt|pef: he played safe for 7 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|s7|pg||
nt|barnets: north has pretty good 10 count with strong intermediate cards|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vdoubleu: me2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|barnets: and north did bid 2n in other room and is in 3N|pg||
nt|barnets: better appreciation of the spot cards and the game bonus|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: only 3 imps -- but if 3@S down or 3@D making or down 1 then gain a lot|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: I give partner an early heads up---but I realize that very few players do (pass)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pef: so he'll take one spade finesse, which is safe because the worst he can do is lose 4 hearts, a club and a spade at this point |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: well 3@D down 1 = push|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|daman: is that your best pitch?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: against 2@S= and gain 1 against 2@S+1|pg||

nt|kareno: Now they should not.|pg||
nt|pef: yes, very much so on a 5332 6 count including a couple of jacks|pg||
nt|kareno: West should put on the brakes here.|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|nt|pef: a fit, I mean|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|pef: 3h another doubleton?|pg||

pc|sA|nt|kareno: The most important time to have the lead is coming up in two more boards :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|barnets: 41v 3 so far this set|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|kareno: Hard to know - if south fit clubs instead of diamonds ... and if anybody had an ace :)|pg||
nt|barnets: i like 5@S by east|pg||
nt|kareno: jA wish trick!!|pg||
nt|kareno: This match is 60 boards.|pg||
nt|pef: yes, the seniors need to get tucked into bid by 9 PM :)|pg||
nt|kareno: The finals of the USA1 match is 90 boards.|pg||
nt|pef: into bed, I mean :)|pg||
nt|kareno: I sure do, Peter :)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|barnets: asking for a diamond control|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|barnets: by east not west|pg||
nt|barnets: west thinking between spades and nt will bid slam|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|ritong: on the other hand, a two level opening cannot be such a long suit|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: then again - he doesn't know what Drew's 3rd seat 2@H looks like, so why should we know what 1st seat 2@D shows|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|barnets: east knows west has not the @DA|pg||
nt|barnets: as he cued hearts first|pg||
nt|barnets: so mabe he should not have picked clubs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|stew: true, but it's our philosophy to presume it's their hand over 1NT and not expect the world when partner interferes|pg||
nt|barnets: with lead coming thru dummy|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|barnets: now he knows the choice was spades or nt|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kareno: Two rounds of trumps will be useful here.  With a club guess, south can bring it in.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
mc|10|nt|ahollan1: who said   can't argue with success|pg||

nt|buffytvs: heart now would create some fun|pg||
nt|rodal f: ?|pg||
nt|rodal f: @C|pg||
nt|rodal f: @C|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Yeah i think they overall score is wrong for some reason.. maybe total travelling score was wrong from the beginning. |pg||
nt|paperika: he is hoping for q second of diamonds, wich is not going to happen|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|nt|kastan88: practical bid from Prescott (west, I hope he is sitting there :))|pg||

nt|stew: everyone will be bidding before Schwartz can even think about his 8-4|pg||
nt|barnets: had the spades been 5-0 6N better|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: This could be a duplicated auction.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: the void makes it an 8-4 i guess :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: yet-another-catchall 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|stew: ok  it looked like a lot of diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: I agree with you!!|pg||
nt|kareno: Penultimate board here.  Many thanks to JoAnna Stansby for bringing the closed room to life for us!!|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|Vugraphu8: flannery|pg||
mb|p|nt|stew: you were right Karen|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: let me check again...yes this is the real auction|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, east's spade ace makes it very unlikely that west is lurking waiting for a double :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: it is fun to do this,  if you (kibs) ever have a chance, I highly recommend you give it a try|pg||
nt|stew: now can he really make this?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=(4+/5+) @C & @D, 0-11 HCP   was also an option |pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Drew just asked how far ahead of the other room they were|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for EW  1@D-3@D = 9-11, INV, very good 6+@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu8: this was alerted as key card|pg||
nt|kareno: A convention I will be playing in DC at the NABC's :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kareno: This lead will help!!|pg||
nt|pef: in the open room, e/w played in 4d.  gaylor kasle found a great end position to make 4d.  take a look at the play in the open room if you want to see a pretty neat hand|pg||
nt|pef: sorry, ron smith was playing the hand--he gets the credit|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: pure thievery now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: then again -- |pg||
nt|ritong: if 4@h is a sort of key ask, now situation is bizarre for sontag|pg||
nt|pef: however, if bramley bids 3nt here, that's not so easy to defeat|pg||
nt|pef: so, this board may easily decide the match.  |pg||
nt|pef: north has only one good lead, the heart K and he's very unlikely to find it|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Bart just announced 2N was natural by a passed hand, 3D undiscussed, but if he were not a passed hand 3D would be afragment|pg||
nt|kareno: This doesn't seem to have much play - looks like a pickup for Kasle to me.|pg||
nt|pef: well let's see on a club lead declarer can take 3 clubs, 3 diamonds, 2 spades and heart |pg||
pc|s5|nt|pef: on a spade lead declarer can take 3s, 2c 3d, and one heart|pg||
nt|kareno: Declarer rates to be very well upholstered in clubs on this auction.|pg||
nt|pef: it's true that n/s might be able to untangle the heart tricks is they do it quickly|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pef: It this is going to be nip tuck and probably decide the match|pg||
nt|pef: chambers may win this and return a low club, if so, bramley may stick in the 10, schermer has to avoid continuing clubs|pg||
nt|kareno: Bart has sparkled on some declarer play hands - let's watch him. |pg||
nt|pef: chambers has his first difficult problem, the k of the 9.  unfortunately after thinking about it so long, bramley will know he has the k|pg||
nt|poohbear: 60 looks like a swing to the Kasle team|pg||
nt|pef: I'd bet either way if someone gives me 6-5 odds :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: sorry Larsen|pg||
pc|s9|nt|stew: I hate the lead|pg||
nt|gff: are they plating 3/5th at nt?|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|poohbear: LOL I am confused Kasle    is the benefactor on 60|pg||
nt|kareno: So we know south didn't have J9 of spades by his tempo.. that suit is known.|pg||
nt|pef: a great finish, bart bramley will either be the hero for making this or the villain for overbidding|pg||
nt|kareno: lol|pg||
nt|pef: we may be here awhile|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kareno: Thanks too, to the USBF (especially the organizer, Jan Martel) for allowing us to join in their tournaments!|pg||
nt|robinswr: don't know why a trump was led when it could be void|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ritong: when he holds three keys and pard is interested with slam, he can t pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Drew asks about 4h Bates writes 0 or 3|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Bates writes while Drew thinks about lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd ask about 4N also|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kareno: Thanks to BBO for a fabulous platform for watching these great events week after week.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|robinswr: dummy could be void and guess what dummy is void|pg||
nt|pef: ok, that is the one suit that surprises me|pg||
nt|kareno: Tricking them by leading hearts himself.|pg||
nt|pef: but bart may have decided the simplest path to 9 tricks is hearts 3-3|pg||
nt|pef: and several of the commentators from the open room are telling me the last board has swing potential either way, also|pg||
nt|kareno: Specs, I really cannot chat with you all :)  |pg||
nt|pef: I would think schermer knows the k of hearts is the right exit here--Bart can hardly have three hearts on this auction|pg||
nt|pef: but again, easier said looking at all four hands|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pef: there will be a whole bunch more long pauses on this hand I think I can safely predict|pg||
nt|kareno: You think :)|pg||
nt|pef: karen, if you were roland, you'd have some cricket stories around now :)|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't have any crickets.  I have one cricket story.. |pg||
nt|kareno: My mother kept telling me she had a cricket in the house (good luck in China)|pg||
nt|kareno: For years it made that chirping sound,.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Have a hard fight here. BUT 3NT are still possible if @SA|pg||
nt|kareno: One day I decided to play a record and opened her cabinet to put one on.|pg||
nt|kareno: Turned out the record player had been going round and round all those years!!  That was the cricket.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|kareno: To my fellow commentators for their wit and wisdom.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|pef: kit woolsey has joined this table.  kit you're a great analyst--do you think there was a clearly right declarer line here?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: still plenty of time to establish @S trick|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kareno: And of course to the specs for keeping us awake!!|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|pef: I think we're now down to 10-1 (or worse) against |pg||
nt|kit: no -- but I sure don't like winning the ace of hearts there|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|kareno: He must have been thinking of Allison's Law, circa 1962, "There's always a ruff in the dummy!!"|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: next version of bbo:  microphones at the vugraph table!!  (I hope)|pg||
nt|kit: if North had been left on lead who knows what he might have done|pg||
nt|pef: safely up with the ace|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pef: yeah, I don't see any advantage to winning the ace at that point|pg||
nt|kareno: Had to duck that ace.|pg||
nt|kit: I'm sure if South worked it out he would know it was safe to duck the club, but he saw the setting tricks|pg||
nt|robinswr: the advantage is that is that he's beating the contract|pg||
nt|pef: so 9 imps with a board to go|pg||
nt|kareno: So five IMPs to Kasle and now a two-board match with one IMP between the teams.|pg||
nt|pef: still anyone's game|pg||
mc|8|nt|ahollan1: save the @D8|pg||
nt|kit: so here we are -- Kasle by 1 going into last board|pg||
nt|pef: ooops, my addition failed me again!|pg||
nt|pef: 1 imp with a board to go|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=2-way Checkback|pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: same auction it looks like|pg||
nt|pef: pass probably won the match|pg||
nt|gff: good guess anyway|pg||
mb|p!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: huh -- that's not consistent with 2-way checkback which is marked on Convention Card|pg||
nt|kit: so Kasle wins by at least 1 unless Stansby finds a way to make, which seems impossible|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gff: sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,too moch tempo for porter|pg||
nt|kareno: I can't see any way to make this one.|pg||

nt|poohbear: keep in mind that our score is not official|pg||

nt|Vugraphu8: bates writing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for specs who are asking   in 2-way Checkback [aka 2-way NMF]  2@C forces 2@D to play 2@D or show some invite|pg||
