nt|Vugraphu1: Gerstman: "think I should rebid 2@s?" Passell "it would have worked out better"|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Will u open 2 @c?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@C or 1@C?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i wouldn't|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|bigtrain: generally speaking, i prefer to have game-in-hand to open 2@C with long minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: We ment 1@C as I understood, but he have the cards|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|rodvenn: so, is 3@c forcing from S? It is in my book|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@C now use to be new force|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rodal f: Therefor 1C opening|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it's just to difficult to handle auctions that start 2@c-2@D//3m unless partner knows you have full values|pg||
nt|rodvenn: then u may not get to 3nt|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sec negative the 3@D I belive|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: N & S both sort of alerted 2@d - I don't know what it was, though, since neither did anything more than point at it|pg||
nt|rodal f: Then only a shot left.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu1: I didn't see any alert of 3@d|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodvenn: but 4@c is passable |pg||
nt|bigtrain: my guess would be they play a direct 2@H bid as double negative, therefore 2@D was GF|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Vernay asks about 2@d and Gerstman says he thinks that 2@h would be second negative so 2@d is semi-positive. Passell : "and 3@d was sort of Staymanish"|pg||

mc|11|nt|rodal f: Europa and Scandinavia have the neg aswers as I exsplained. |pg||
nt|rodal f: I see|pg||
nt|rodvenn: i play 2@h as very negative. It is great|pg||
nt|bigtrain: except when the partnership belongs in @H|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will not getme in there, but a agreement by the system|pg||
nt|rodvenn: well, you may pass 2@h !|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it can really distort auctions...  i just don't see an upside|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i've actually seen someone do that and they cuaght 4 trump and a singleton in partner's hand...  anyone who passes 2@H might as well be playing poker|pg||
