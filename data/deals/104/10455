nt|USBF: hi kit @H|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: everyone is seated, brief discussion of methods|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2N|nt|kit: we can envision east bidding a lot of clubs at his first opportunity here|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|kit: N-S could bid up to 5@D, but this goes down on the heart ruff|pg||
nt|lc: Textbook weak 2.|pg||
nt|lc: Opp a sound preemptor (especially a 2nd seat preempt), North might be worth a try.|pg||
nt|pab1: sound weak two|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: This will probably end the auction.  then, ace of clubs, 2 of clubs (suit preference for heart back), heart back and ruff for down 1|pg||
mb|5D|nt|kit: Kasle doesn't have much|pg||
nt|lc: I am always asked:  Feature or Ogust?  No strong feelings.  Just make sure you play it the same way as your partner :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: this is just an overbid -- KJ of clubs basically wasted, so he really has nothing extra|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jimkrek: right-like so many things-prefer ougust myself|pg||
nt|lc: So, with @H breaking and @C hook on, this looks like a make.  But I can see a trap or two to fall into.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lc: For example, dec might try for @D ruff in dummy and suffer a @C ruff against him in the process.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: Kasle doesn't have a workable falsecard here|pg||
nt|pab1: attempt to ruff a Diamond in Dummy could lead to defensive Club ruff|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kit: Sutherlin will now have to decide whether to play his partner for the ace of spades or a singleton club|pg||
nt|kit: actually he does havwe a workable falsecard -- the king -- and it might have worked|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spec says -- should have played @C6 from dummy to hide the 3 :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lc: Sure, from our catbird seat we would draw trump and finesse @C -- what's the problem. :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3nt anyone?|pg||
nt|lc: 3NT needs only the @H.|pg||
nt|poohbear: or the @c|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pab1: I thought the Diamond feature might push North into 3NT|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|kit: if Kasle had been sharp enough to dump the king of clubs, I don't know that Sutherlin would have gotten it right|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|nt|kit: I don't know why he didn't return the 2 of clubs|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lc: On @S, @S, @S, declarer is likely to ruff with @H10.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jimkrek: reasonably he ducked..now......|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|lc: or the 9 :)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lc: Techincally, the 10 is a better play.  (Now, East knows where the @H10 is).|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pab1: eminently logical Spade plays by Defense have removed the Club Ruff danger, since there is a quick Spade reentry to South|pg||
nt|jimkrek: he is good to go now if trumps are 3-2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lc: Yup.  He will ruff @D.  Then @HA.  Then ruff @S with H10.  Draw trumps.|pg||

mb|p|nt|lc: Is par 5@S X -1 ?  that's a very quick guess.|pg||
nt|pab1: 5D doubled, needed a saftey play n DIamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|jimkrek: yes|pg||
nt|lc: "PAR" means the best that both pairs can do.|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: this could lead to an ugly 4-3 spade fit if North raises|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: 2@C or X with North?|pg||
nt|jimkrek: 4s makes-5d makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S my bid too :(|pg||
mb|p|pc|h2|nt|kit: 2@S pretty clear -- but South might have responded 1NT rather than 1@S|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lc: Looks like N-S may now get blown out of their 10-card @D fit.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lc: Surely, if Kasle had doubled 1@H, this wouldn't have happened.  I don't hate 2@C, though.  Any other opinions?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kit: of course, if playing forcing NT that might not have worked so well|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: especially if playing Flannery -- and by my count 5 pairs in this trials are using that convention|pg||
pc|h8|nt|stew: 2C shows your clubs  Double shows your hand|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|jimkrek: maybe with 3 spades n sd figure they have a fit and bid again|pg||
nt|lc: Is that a vote for double, Stew?|pg||
nt|stew: 100%|pg||
nt|stew: Double then fold up your cards|pg||
nt|lc: Or table them in 5@D doubled, on this deal.|pg||
nt|lc: I guarantee you this:  Berk will know when hand is over that he has a very good result.  (He is very analytical about the deals).|pg||
nt|lc: After every hand, he wants to know : "who came make what"|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|poohbear: Learnt from the HOG  ( Ron andersen)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|poohbear: He was the best at it|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lc: It is human nature to want to know, but sometimes it takes away mental energy for the rest of the deals.|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|lc: Really, so much of bridge is not how you do in your contract, but how it relates to what the opponents could make.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lc: Nice @D play to tempt hop with @DA for overtrick.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: this is playing well|pg||

nt|ritong: sorry, could not resist:-)|pg||
nt|stew: After all Larson did lose by one imp |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kit: So far so good, but now defenders can draw trumps |pg||
nt|ahollan1: although Smith will still worry about location of @CA|pg||
nt|kit: But then long heart will be good, and so will king of clubs as East is out of diamonds|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: @Cx?|pg||

nt|kit: This is probably limit raise, and could lead to excellent 5@C contract|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|me argent: 3nt by S?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Ron had bid 3N to show stops in both majors -- Gerstman NOT finding @DK lead|pg||
nt|me argent: nope|pg||
nt|kit: play in 5@C may be interesting -- we can see that it makes with heart finesse, but declarer won't know that is on and there are other lines possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is 3@S best try to find @D stop?     with 3@H worry about @S and 3@D worry about one of majors|pg||
nt|kit: Of course West will have to lead something, and either major will make it easy for declarer|pg||
nt|lc: I know some who would upgrade Lair's hand to a strong 1NT.  Which would lead to 3NT.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|stew: Ugly|pg||
nt|lc: 13 HCP +1 for the 5th @D +1 for the @H1098 + + .../|pg||
nt|jimkrek: the distinguished drewski has joined us all to maybe enlighten us...as to how he will win this match...unless i embarrassed him too much:) |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|kit: it it so clear that 3@S doesn't show worry about both red suits?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure - that's why i asked -- thought good chance that i was hallucinating|pg||
nt|kit: Gerstman will do well to lead a trump, which he might find|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: this works well also -- declarer can't duck, of course|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|stew: 1NT far more comfortable than 3|pg||
nt|stew: and more makeable|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kit: will ruff a diamond and play a trump, I think|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|lc: With a @C misguess, he has only 6 sure tricks here.|pg||
nt|ritong: oy|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|lc: But, @H sets up -- so shouldn't be a problem to make 1NT|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|lc: @H really set up now!|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|kit: Now let's see what Sutherlin shifts to|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|poohbear: Smith should realize that if partner wants unblock he plays the 10|pg||
nt|lc: Is "oy" French for "they screwed up the hearts?"|pg||
nt|drewsky: hi|pg||
nt|ritong: inter alia, larry|pg||
nt|jimkrek: hiya drew|pg||
nt|stew: yes ... both partners do NOT unblock  |pg||
nt|poohbear: How we gonna win this match Drewski?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|h5|pc|c5|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jimkrek: still 11 bds to go|pg||
nt|drewsky: an IMP a board ? and a little bit more ?|pg||
nt|stew: But Larry was certainly correct about that 109x of hearts "upgrade"|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kit: declarer may try to ruff out queen of hearts, with spades in reserve -- if he tries that, he can go down|pg||
nt|lc: :)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: now key play here -- will he double hook|pg||
nt|poohbear: 10xx would have achieved the same affect :)|pg||
nt|stew: either side can still win this match   Lots of Bridge yet to play|pg||
nt|lc: Kasle dodged a bullet on 48 when other table also failed to find Diamonds N-S.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kit: now he is in trouble|pg||
nt|jimkrek: BUT CAN WE STAY UP THIS LATE???:)|pg||
nt|lc: Same 2@C overcall instead of takeout X.  |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||

pc|s9|pc|d4|pc|s7|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: but a very reasonable line|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kit: He has no choice but to try to ruff out queen of hearts, then run trumps and hope for good ending, but it doesn't happen|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|kit: very close between what he did and simply taking two finesses |pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|lc: Pass denies 3@H.  I think it should be alertable, but ACBL disagrees.|pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: This one is easy -- 3 clubs, 3 hearts, 2 spades, and 1 diamond -- at least|pg||
nt|lc: So, Lair's X is "cards."  Now they will reach either 4@H or 3NT.|pg||

nt|jimkrek: the beauty of it|pg||

nt|stew: This helps the timing|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lc: Declarer could conceivable play the VUL overcaller for the @HA and South for the J10x -- but I doubt it.  He is likely to play @H to his King.|pg||
nt|stew: Yes, as Larry noted ... with those diamonds spots (J9) in North, I think all roads lead to 420|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now time to misguess @D|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lc: Or, a @D might go on the @S.|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless Dan helps|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kit: that solves declarer's problems -- declarer might have gone wrong in diamond suit if Gerstman hadn't split|pg||

nt|lc: P P 1@S 2@H X to start.|pg||
nt|lc: Want 3:1 again?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: this is a 60 board match -- loser goes home, winner plays another 60 tomorrow against Schwartz to become USA2|pg||
nt|stew: no agree|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kit: Sutherlin will be thinking slam here, and slam it is|pg||
mb|d|mb|2C|nt|kit: If Gerstman pre-accepts, it will be easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: yep -- here comes RKC I predict|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit, Joey -- do you have any other super-accept other than 3M?|pg||
nt|kit: yes, but it really isn't very valuable|pg||
nt|me argent: i dont play transfers over 1nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: forgot  Canada=2-way Stayman|pg||
mb|3C|nt|me argent: easier less discussions|pg||
nt|lc: P 2@S X next|pg||
mb|3S|nt|stew: think they'll play here|pg||
nt|lc: Boo!|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I agree with this call -- bringing partner into the picture isn't going to help much -- it is Sutherlin who has the 2-suiter and source of tricks|pg||
nt|lc: berk let me down.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: another good question from audience -- after super accept is 3N COG or some form of slam try - hard for me to imagine COG|pg||
nt|kit: 5@C shows 0 or 3 -- East could ask for queen of trumps, but since he won't be bidding a grand anyway I think he will just bid 6@S|pg||
nt|kit: clearly some sort of slam try -- you can't know to play 3NT with 9-card fit|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, minors do not sound to behave|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose the Vul got to him.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|me argent: i like to play 3nt as meaning i hope 2 take 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: He knows he has to hear from me post-match when he lets the opps play in 2@S with 8.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: The super accept should always have a doubleton somewhere, and how can responder know it doesn't match his own doubleton?|pg||
nt|kit: This will make easily as cards lie, but far from clear what the safest line of play for 12 tricks is -- remember declarer doesn't know everything is friendly|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's why i asked about super accept - some show doubleton along the way others only have the one bid for good fit|pg||
nt|kit: there are complex things one can do with super-accept, but they really don't gain much if anything.|pg||
nt|kit: assuming 3-1 spade split, declarer has 6 spade tricks, 2 club tricks, 2 diamond tricks, and 1 heart trick on power -- he needs to find the safest  12|pg||
nt|kit: I think the best line is to take two rounds of trumps, one high trump in each hand, and then work on clubs -- but I'm far from sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is type of hand where i have trouble -- how many rounds of trump and from which hand(s)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: usually the amount of time spent on permutations is inversely proportional to difficulty of actual layout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e. if think long time -- trump 22, other suit 33 AND @D finesse wins|pg||
nt|me argent: more importantly he was not wrong|pg||
nt|stew: he traded a minus for a plus|pg||
nt|ritong: well, it is not 100%|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lc: Not clear to me.|pg||
nt|stew: cute|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|kit: it looks like he is going to try crossruff lines instead -- I'm not so sure this is right, but on lie of cards anything will work it appears|pg||
nt|lc: 3@H prob down, but sometimes they bid 3@S.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ritong: south should not hold a @s singleton, right, but north can be forced to repeat suit with only 5|pg||
nt|lc: And 2@S isn't down yet.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|stew: that is true|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reverse dummy|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very interesting alternative that none of us saw|pg||
nt|kit: this is a reasonable approach, but risk various overruffs etc.  I still think working on clubs is better|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, I do understand David's Pass.|pg||
nt|lc: But, I would have doubled :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: oh I saw it, just didn't think it was best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry kit -- none of us MENTIONED|pg||
nt|kit: now how high to ruff?  That is the problem.|pg||
nt|kit: If South has doubleton diamond, need to ruff high -- but if trumps are bad, need to ruff low|pg||
nt|kit: This is why I rejected this approach|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: or ruff high, then rely upon @C33 -- i think|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if trump 31|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lc: Meanwhile, it seem Kasle played the hand nicely.  Right? I was typing instead of watching.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kit: note that he still doesn't have a claim (from his point of view)|pg||
nt|stew: 2S will make|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: @H ruff, @SA, claim|pg||

nt|babydolldk: Unless you lead a @H 6@D is only 1100 v. 1370:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: This is a forcing Pass by E|pg||
mb|2N!|an|asking|nt|poohbear: I think 2C may be either natural or a balanced GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well south having shown his spades first presumably this will be played in spades now|pg||
mb|3N|an|really GF|mb|p|nt|lestergold: nope|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh well, also missed the 4@S, tough hand to land right|pg||
nt|mariner1: I guess 5@S can make too though|pg||
nt|lestergold: after 4d it wa surely correct fopr north to give preference to spades he had al reay bid the pips off a 6 card heart suit with poor intermediates|pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure that is possible either|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a lost opportunity for a swing here unless north 'corrects' to spades|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mariner1: in Open Room S bid @S twice and they still did not get to 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: its pretty much 16+ with @c, what he has|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: (assuming polish @c)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Not much excitement - only they have not reached a makeable C slam|pg||
nt|mariner1: a none @c lead allows a make|pg||
nt|mariner1: non|pg||
nt|lestergold: now Jones ha to find the killing club lead |pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@s will not fare well\|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: and he has|pg||
nt|poohbear: even with that lead not much declarer can do to avoid going 2 off|pg||
nt|poohbear: Best to win in Dummy and play a @c to try to negotiate a ruff|pg||
nt|poohbear: alternatively if you trust the lead you can draw trumps and if 3-2 play for 4 @d tricks and then lead a @c off dummy|pg||

nt|drewsky: no way;;;gaylor told me what they play|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: hope West knows this is forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N opening with 5 card major is absolutely a partnership issue.  Gamut runs all the way from NEVER to ALWAYS and some have rules for in between|pg||
nt|me argent: even not 4@HS look auto|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Jon is writing something for kasle which i can't read|pg||
nt|lc: Well, Bob--did you see it written as a @S honor?|pg||
mb|p|pc|c9|nt|kit: of course 4@h hasn't made yet since 2 heart losers if you play heart to queen and ace, but even that can be overcome|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Kit - what do you think of Sutherlin choice of NEG DBL vs  3@H game force?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is it just a matter of suit quality?|pg||

nt|stew: Great spot|pg||
nt|me argent: NS are doing alot of screwing arround|pg||
nt|poohbear: but not the MP spot|pg||

nt|lc: Even at IMPs, 4@S is probably worthwhile.  650 is 2 IMPs -- and even 620 is 1 IMP on 4-2 @S.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: sorry 2 card limit raise|pg||

nt|mariner1: EW make lots of @H|pg||
nt|poohbear: 7 more to Russia when Croatia voluntarily bid 4@s on brd 6 and went down|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: well 5@H did not fare well in Open Room, seems that had a play|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: a trump lead here is best vs @H|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: clubs lie badly too many losers in the black s in east's hand to be dealt with bearing in mind a 3/1 rump break|pg||
mb|1N!|an|H+CL|nt|davidb: E  does not like XXX in Spades ..|pg||

mb|p|nt|charles_l: normal to be in 4@h down here|pg||
nt|charles_l: esp at imps|pg||

nt|mariner1: well they should be warned about the breaks now|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|davidb: the question if 3H shows shape as well or can be x H |pg||
mb|d|nt|babydolldk: Yes, maybe difficult for w to play a @D...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: E not happy with partner's bid|pg||

mb|3H|nt|raghavan: The final bid optimum and correct|pg||
nt|lestergold: on the bidding and lead best to set up dims after trumps dawn|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: has anybody seen X=trf before?|pg||
nt|lc: At these colors 1@S overcall easy.  I wouldn't if Red vs. White.|pg||
nt|lc: The way my partners lead, I have to get an AQxxx suit in if I can -- especially with xxx and xx in the other side suits.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: assuming that's what it meant from the auction|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose Berk didn't have a 3@C fit-showing bid available.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Vugraphu8: Danny alertede 2s as 3 pieces|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: 3@C is not what Lair needs to hear for reaching 5@D.|pg||
mb|p|pc|c3|nt|kit: competing to 3@H reasonable, as 2@S would have made|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Spelling and tyoping have always been my strength|pg||
nt|lc: Without a @S lead, 5@D would be great, but the auction (South's X of 2@S) has worked for N-S.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lc: He accepted his own try.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lc: Had East's first call not been 2@S, they might have made 5@D.  South would never have gotten to X for lead.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lc: Then again, the auction (no 3NT) might have led North to lead @S no matter what.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pc|h7|nt|jimkrek: yes|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, for a VUL game, this wasn't so bad.  @D could have behaved.|pg||
nt|lc: I believe there has been no swing (other than 1 or 2) in 20+ deals now!|pg||
nt|lc: That is hughly unusual -- especially since there has been swing potential.|pg||
nt|lc: The bridge has been decent.  Not great.  Not awful.  No swing in 20 boards usually means excellent bridge.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
nt|drewsky: yeah, where is all the volatility when you need it...I feel like I am backspread in a dead market :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kit: Unfortunately, 3@H won't be making -- but at least not conceding letting opponents play 2@S -- and might push them 1 level higher|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|lc: And, finally, a WHOPPING 4-imp swing on Board 53.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lc: But not the right way for you, Drew.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|kit: did this club trick really go that way?|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|stew: lots of good bridge, but no imps|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Vugraphu8: yes|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|Vugraphu8: ron claims down 1|pg||
nt|drewsky: thats it..I am selling all my calls and gonna start selling premium|pg||
nt|lc: In a 60-Board match, a more normal final score would be something like 150-120.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s5|nt|stew: still a lot of bridge to go ... we just need a bit of Action!|pg||
pc|c4|pc|sJ|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lc: Certainly, Kasle could gain 6 on this one if the stay out of game at other table.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Where are the " made for TV " boards?|pg||
nt|stew: true ... as for the "made for TV boards"  they only show those ... just like in Poker ... they skip all these|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lc: I think Lair can arrange to down to 4 Jacks for the last 2 tricks -- is that worth anything?|pg||
nt|poohbear: a chop in poker|pg||
nt|lc: 7 deals after this.|pg||
nt|lc: 7 including this.  OK|pg||
nt|drewsky: clearly it is correct to not overruff|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose declarer can always escape for -1.  Nice postion.|pg||

mb|p|nt|davidb: normal game in H .  |pg||
mb|2C|an|stayman|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mariner1: so a chance for Greece to pull it back to close|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: this contract depends basically on which hand the hearts are played from|pg||
nt|lestergold: the natural play of a heart up to the KQ loses of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: well Ekrens 2@d is not new|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i mean who is going to play a heart tghe other way then losing the chance of finessing against the tenof hearts if th hearts break 4/1 the other way|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3 nt with lots of chances after the @c lead and the king wins|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphztr: let's see|pg||
pc|cK|nt|babydolldk: On board 7 they bid 6@C|pg||
nt|raghavan: But if 2D is both Majors - the hand must be a real opening hand - or else difficult for respondaseer to judge - as in this c|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i just noticed. 6@S played by Schermer in West made overtrick  after @H, 2 rounds of trump then @C|pg||

mb|p|nt|davidb: probably W knows his partners agressive jumps -if not 4sp is ok nv|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: weak jump shift in @D  good way to hide 9 card @C fit :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|stew: that might just get them there|pg||
nt|lc: Actually, that shows long @C and might do it.|pg||
nt|lc: Kasle has great hand opposite long @C.|pg||
nt|lc: I suspect 3NT was a slight "state of match" action by Smith. |pg||
nt|ritong: long and solid|pg||
nt|lc: He can estimate that he is likely trailing and in need of a swing.|pg||
nt|ritong: for that purpose, a 2NT opening might have been an option too|pg||
nt|lc: As to the "proper" rebid, I suppose  2NT, 3@C and even 2@D are all possible.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: 3NT about to go down on 57 -- so big swing for Lynch.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Defense will have to cash their clubs, but that shouldn't be too difficult|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|lc: 3NT was played from other side on @D lead.  Def got in and cashed out.|pg||

pc|dA|nt|athene: i think many people do lead partner's suit too often - a lot of experts avoid it and look for something unexpected if opps bid confidently to 3NT|pg||

nt|athene: when rodwell overcalled 1@S|pg||

nt|mariner1: excellent job!!!|pg||
nt|poohbear: another 10 for Croatia on 18 when the other room couldnt make 5@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: 19 tricks in M' s|pg||
nt|athene: might end up in 2NT here|pg||
nt|mug: if EW reach 3NT on these cards they will make it easily|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: ty to Florin|pg||
nt|mug: but the values are not really there|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|mariner1: many thanks to all the sponsors and organizers for helping BBO bring us the|pg||

nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at it!|pg||
nt|mariner1: special thanks to all the spectators, those comments and tips really do help us a lot!|pg||
nt|athene: a heart lead is nice, whoever declares|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N in N made 4 here in Open Room|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: oops 1N in EAST made 4|pg||

mb|p|nt|davidb: thx all . see you later |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thanks, bye|pg||
nt|poohbear: this should buy it|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: East downgrades somewhat - he has 11 HCP but it doesn't look good|pg||
nt|athene: he expects to need 9 fast tricks on a heart lead to make 3nt|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes its not a quality 11 at all|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mug: Open Room result by the way was 1NT +3|pg||
nt|athene: and he has no aces and no long suit...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: double denied 4 spades, i assume, so 2@S is just offering to play the Moysian|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|mug: imaginative 2@S bid from Bell, he has denied four of them, so 2@S shows three, maximum for his bidding, partner can work it out|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: taking the heart ruff in the short hand if partner has 4-3-3-3 or something like that|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mariner1: for fun I put E had into the K&R evaluator K&R (KT6 K3 KQ84 7652) = 10.65|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: so E has an 11 worth less than face value|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mariner1: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi   K&R|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|pg||
nt|mariner1: the good news here in N does not have a high @c pip|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|athene: the defence can organize south a heart ruff but that doesn't help them enormously|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|raghavan: S has to give atleast a Spade and 2Clubs|pg||
nt|charles_l: looks -2 here|pg||
nt|charles_l: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule (set up to show times for your area) thanks to Roland Wald (Denmark) the BBO vugraph co-ordinator|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mug: @CK in fear of the heart ruff|pg||
nt|mariner1: well that play worked for S|pg||
nt|athene: pressure play from south!|pg||
nt|mug: but it may have cost him the contract|pg||
nt|athene: west doesn't want to lose to @CQ and then @C9 on the overruff and @CA@DA to come|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mug: don't think South would have played a trump from @CAxx|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|charles_l: still 4 to play in the open room|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|raghavan: Open room seems  to be slow |pg||
pc|s6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|raghavan: curtains|pg||
nt|charles_l: thanks all and bye|pg||
nt|babydolldk: bye|pg||
nt|raghavan: TX and Byeeee to alll |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: app. W had doubled|pg||
nt|mug: but it was a good shot by South|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|mariner1: now he can lose 9@C in ruff too|pg||
nt|athene: if south really did have @CA9x and want a heart over-ruff, it would be more natural for him to try spades and diamonds to find partner's ace|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps lead a diamond simply to try to set up a diamond ruff for partner|pg||
nt|athene: so perhaps that small trump was suspicious - but not at all easy for declarer to be fair|pg||
