nt|rodal f: Test|pg||
nt|rodal f: A back|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: I don't much like the 2@C bid or the double|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: Gill almost didnt score in the first segment so it would be nice to get something on the scoreboard|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: they don't play standard minor openings|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|kastan88: but sure , this depends from agreements about 3@C opening, may be they play destructive preempts|pg||
nt|rodal f: Page well wourth to bookmark. Then u always get the web pages for the turneys at BBO: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the clubs did look kind of attractive but I would lead a heart myself|pg||
nt|buffytvs: normal lead, but not one that will strike fear into the heart of declarer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: heart lead is Trick 7 right there|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: And we have the two top ranked team at the finale as I can see. Look at: http://www.nswba.com.au/tourn/res.asp?yr=2009&dir=congress/nssc&E=0&R=3&T=I|pg||
mb|p|pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: are Burgess-Prescott playing a natural system??|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|nt|kastan88: watching from here, from Dark side of Earth (Estonia), seems that Australians opening all 10-11 points hands usually :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|d5|nt|buffytvs: think this always makes in fact|pg||
nt|lml: I think after he ducked the club he might have gone done|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: both have long history with Moscito -- Prescott has his own Modified Polish -- so the settled on Acol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oy|pg||
nt|rodal f: And here u are the web for this turney: http://www.northshore.bridge-club.org/|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- diamond shift then.  Tough to find|pg||
nt|lml: yes but the duck by declarer was a mistake|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lml: maybe thats harsh|pg||
nt|lml: he doesn't know the @HA is onside|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|buffytvs: and he may have time to duck another club, which is known to be to South so safe|pg||
nt|lml: South needs to cash to hold the uptrick |pg||
nt|lml: if he counts East he knows he has to|pg||
nt|lml: Burgess has the @sA/K for sure|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kastan88: welcome back|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s8|nt|buffytvs: and the D!K|pg||
nt|rodal f: The 2 teams playing now are the 2 ranked as 1 and 2 before the turney started|pg||
pc|sK|nt|buffytvs: @DK|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kastan88: needed to duck 1st @D for ruff  later, now declarer must decide right trump position|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|nt|lml: yes I can't see any situation where a club back is right |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|kastan88: and again not right labels for teams: Prescott-Burgess playing for Dyke|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|rodal f: Belive we will see an end at 4@S.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can it be Ekren's 2@D?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Min 44 in majors|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: explained as could be 4-4 in majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|lml: interesting in the other room they doubled 4@h on that first hand on the same auction|pg||
nt|lml: as we discussed|pg||
nt|buffytvs: as you suggested|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Thx Erin:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: A balance to come?|pg||
mb|p|pc|c2|nt|paperika: better to not be gredy|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|paperika: wise play|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kastan88: 4@S for NS if just find out @DQ, 3NT the same thing with @H lead, but now just easy if spades 32|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: That was passive by Prescott. But he are normaly better then me|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|rodal f: Better take ure last trick in @H I belive.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kastan88: So in real NS is Gill team and EW is Dyke, so pls read scores 10:3 for Gill|pg||
nt|kastan88: ducking @C sets up squeeze situation for 10th trick, |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|vugrapha3: it doesnt matter, she should've just claimed !|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|buffytvs: quiet start to the set though|pg||
nt|lml: this contract is not a challenge|pg||

mb|1S|nt|rodal f: Could have been a swing by 200.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|rodal f: But still might a fight from S|pg||
nt|rodal f: No lebensol?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lml: I might used Drury|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: that's a conservative 2@S -- for me , anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Normal action from Gill.|pg||
nt|paperika: if they will double they are going to be very sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: I tihnk burgess was thinking about 5 spadse|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rodal f: N should bid 2NT. Order for S to bid 3@C|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: 1c is 5+ clubs or strong balanced|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 1d is 5+ diamonds or weakbalanced|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2S!|an|intermediate|nt|kastan88: previous board you saw the problems with muiderberg type openings: 5!M+4-card another, sure you must keep system, ut still why not pass, if your points are not in long suits?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: so they might open 1d with longer clubs or 1c with longer diamonds if they have a balanced hand|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|vugrapha3: After a play infraction and a long wait for a director we resume action..|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|paperika: does 1 sp mean something that he didn-t bid it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: Gumby likes the good news about long diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: his hand is getting better and better|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugrapha3: Sorry, all. BBO keeps timing out. |pg||
nt|lml: we understand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it might guarantee unbal hand|pg||

nt|sybarra: with you here |pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Ed:) Nice to see u|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Sorry program crashed|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Erin!|pg||
nt|lml: that is the easiest way to get to 7@D|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi u to Shirley:) |pg||
pc|sK|nt|buffytvs: was that really the auction?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|Walddk4: what a coincidence, both operators are named Erin|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Rodal!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: 4@D RKC?|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|sybarra: hi all |pg||
nt|sybarra: and HI  Rodal |pg||
nt|othered1: On this auction, does it look like south "never took a bid?"|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice start for a safe play til 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive the web page are: http://www.northshore.bridge-club.org/|pg||
nt|othered1: Would have been nice for south to have shown a semi-solid (1-loser) suit and north would go with all those winners and controls.|pg||
nt|othered1: If their methods permit that type of action|pg||
nt|rodal f: And as told before we have the 2 top ranked teams in the final: http://www.nswba.com.au/tourn/res.asp?yr=2009&dir=congress/nssc&E=0&R=3&T=I|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rodal f: Seem like they will get 11 as in 4@H. Tough a bit surpriced that E did not lead @S |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: so the bid would be for that  Ed?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not sure at all about their auction.  1@C-1@D-1@H looks like it isn't standard american.|pg||

nt|gff: hi all|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Swanson wants to ask all about Schwartz's hand....how many diamonds did you have Ritchie. |pg||
nt|kareno: Gene, it's so good to see you on here :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hi Gene|pg||
nt|reisig: true|pg||
nt|daman: you are named after me Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even for the players :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|stew: hi Gene|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd seat -- Drew could do anything here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Vugraphu8: welcome Gene (we all know you have excellent Hy-giene"|pg||
nt|robinswr: would jones overcall 1nt over a 1spade opener to get even|pg||
nt|kareno: Ewww, JoAnna :) :) :)|pg||
nt|reisig: 5@s is a good save :)|pg||
nt|daman: THAT was a strong weak 2|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vdoubleu: lol|pg||
nt|gff: hI Ladies good to be here but rathr br plsying|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: We have to take the good with the bad:)|pg||
nt|robinswr: will north show his five hearts?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wouldn't be surprised if MSC got some votes for each of 1/2/3/4@H|pg||
mb|5H|mb|5S|nt|robinswr: the doubleton club says yes|pg||
nt|reisig: Nice bid Sonty|pg||
nt|daman: they better get their ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he likes his 4333 shape|pg||
mb|6C|nt|daman: ugh|pg||
nt|ahollan1: protection against misdefense :(|pg||
nt|daman: 6@C was not on my radar|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how likely do you think @C lead from Onstott?|pg||
nt|daman: some players are devoid of green cards|pg||
nt|ritong: one down versus one down with a perfect lead looks like the right decision|pg||
nt|ritong: hi guys|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: east must have thought 2clubs was majors|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: 2@C was alerted by East "out loud"|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: North requests future alerts in writing|pg||
nt|daman: Salut Henri|pg||
mb|6H|nt|reisig: 2@h promises ...how many @hs?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but would 5@S go down after @H lead?|pg||
nt|reisig: Henri!!   Nice to see ya :)|pg||
nt|daman: hard to say|pg||
nt|ritong: hey buddy:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|gff: issn't two diamnds enuf? why 3 clubs  by Solodar?|pg||
nt|robinswr: out loud is a clear violation|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Schwartz says "I am going to need a director"|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu8: brb|pg||
nt|gff: zorry cant csnt p;lsy 2 hesrts|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: director on the way|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Director here now|pg||
nt|robinswr: i guess the only reason east would bid 2hearts is if he was 5-6 in the reds so therefore 3diamonds is a possibility |pg||
nt|reisig: The only thing I say out loud ..."need a bathroom break"|pg||
nt|robinswr: same here|pg||
nt|stew: and in the seniors they are needed far more frequently|pg||
nt|robinswr: i place the alert card on the bid until my opponent tells me to take it off|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Swanson says:  I did alert outloud as Stayman, but I don't think anyone heard.   Turns out Jones says it was also alerted as Stayman on his side of screen (I didn't see it)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: so apparently no problem, since both alerted as Stayman|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: down 1 not vul seems like good insurance against possible vul 5@S|pg||
pc|dK|nt|robinswr: some play 3diamonds invitational but NF can be passed if the raise was 3-card |pg||
pc|d2|nt|robinswr: don't understand the trump lead since dummy could be void in clubs|pg||
nt|robinswr: and you're supposed to lead low from 2 when leading trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Kib has a good Question,  so why not bid 2@S after 2@H|pg||
nt|kareno: I certainly would have led a plain suit, not a trump.|pg||
nt|kareno: It may not have occurred to John Solodar.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: how do they find 4-4 spade fit??|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
pc|sA|nt|robinswr: i've seen situations where you lead top and later you would have been able to overruff with it|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vdoubleu: At the table, I thk he was a bit upset, thinking they had had an accident.....so maybe was not thinking clearly.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ritong: several ways to make the rest, let s see which one drew will adopt|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|sQ|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|robinswr: setting up the cross ruff before drawing trumps|pg||
nt|robinswr: he might need to ruff the 4th diamond and the club in dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ruff @S, 1 round of trump then switch to @C ruffs?  nope 1 trump first -- i was so close :(|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: heh|pg||
pc|s7|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|robinswr: he won't draw trumps since they could be 4-1|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: now must guess @C position|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|robinswr: solodar has to guess spades|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|reisig: nah ..@d will be good|pg||
nt|daman: setting up the @Ds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wrong again Al -- @D 33|pg||
nt|ritong: but you were close again:)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: i'm better with translating obscure bidding sequences|pg||
nt|ritong: where is ekeblad when we need him|pg||
mc|11|nt|ahollan1: nice combination of options Drew --- of that i'm positive!!!|pg||

nt|buffytvs: that's the way you like it to be when you bid a grand|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|d|an|support|mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: with a weak hand she'd have 5 clubs|pg||

nt|sybarra: it appears|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: should manage 2  possibly and OT|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Best def on. Belive 8 tricks EW now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Gumby really doesn't like this hand.|pg||

mb|p|pc|c9|nt|buffytvs: ah that makes more sense :)|pg||

mb|1D|nt|stew: I think it's a question of methods over NT overcall.  clearly this was not best on this hand|pg||
nt|robinswr: solodar played the hand much better than granovettor did|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|mb|1S|nt|robinswr: and he got a diamond lead setting up 4 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: What does everyone bid here?|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|c7|nt|robinswr: i do not understand why good players don't play 4spades as rkc when hearts are trump|pg||

nt|Vugraphu8: quite a result for N-S in open room.   It looks like the defense needs to find a very early heart shift|pg||

nt|Vugraphu8: earlier in the match,  there was a discussion about "return to suit = weak and pass = interest"|pg||

mb|d!|an|business|nt|kareno: For this hand, I propose a break for a cup of tea ... (_)? ... and a few cookies ... OOO.|pg||
nt|robinswr: 2diamonds was probably some sort of drury and 2hearts shows an opening bid|pg||
nt|kareno: Not much interest other than staying out of slam :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I think they use 3- and 4-card drury, useful with four-card majors.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: the defense to 4@S (last hand) might have a shot if West ducks first trump, and then sees trump suit pref ....may be able to switch to heart away from Queen|pg||

pc|d7|nt|stew: this will be only the second push of the set|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: table taking a short break|pg||

nt|Vugraphu8: John really bid 2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|robinswr: but the opponents will not let them play in 2spades|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe onstott considered that a three level opening cannot be such a good suit|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|stew: Same auciton at other table except now North (Wolf) blasted into 4s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh i believe the bid -- was trying to claim MY 3@D was typo :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|barnets: west did not overcall last board 1@S and then led a diamond v 4@H so that is making too|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|barnets: 41v 3 so far this set|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kareno: Hard to know - if south fit clubs instead of diamonds ... and if anybody had an ace :)|pg||
nt|barnets: i like 5@S by east|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|barnets: asking for a diamond control|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|barnets: by east not west|pg||
nt|barnets: west thinking between spades and nt will bid slam|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|ritong: on the other hand, a two level opening cannot be such a long suit|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: then again - he doesn't know what Drew's 3rd seat 2@H looks like, so why should we know what 1st seat 2@D shows|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|barnets: east knows west has not the @DA|pg||
nt|barnets: as he cued hearts first|pg||
nt|barnets: so mabe he should not have picked clubs|pg||
pc|c5|nt|stew: true, but it's our philosophy to presume it's their hand over 1NT and not expect the world when partner interferes|pg||
nt|barnets: with lead coming thru dummy|pg||
pc|c9|nt|barnets: now he knows the choice was spades or nt|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kareno: Two rounds of trumps will be useful here.  With a club guess, south can bring it in.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
mc|8|nt|ahollan1: who said   can't argue with success|pg||

pc|hT|nt|idblu: this loses the @S trick|pg||

pc|d7|nt|vugrapha3: g|pg||

nt|paperika: devil contract|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: sorry frank, is there an error in the score??|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was told so from a spec|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: it might be from the open room, mine match the playters here|pg||

nt|lml: a heart is okay now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: heart now would create some fun|pg||
nt|rodal f: ?|pg||
nt|rodal f: @C|pg||
nt|rodal f: @C|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Yeah i think they overall score is wrong for some reason.. maybe total travelling score was wrong from the beginning. |pg||
nt|paperika: he is hoping for q second of diamonds, wich is not going to happen|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|kastan88: practical bid from Prescott (west, I hope he is sitting there :))|pg||

nt|stew: everyone will be bidding before Schwartz can even think about his 8-4|pg||
nt|barnets: had the spades been 5-0 6N better|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kareno: This could be a duplicated auction.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: the void makes it an 8-4 i guess :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: yet-another-catchall 1@D|pg||
mb|2D|nt|stew: ok  it looked like a lot of diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: I agree with you!!|pg||
nt|kareno: Penultimate board here.  Many thanks to JoAnna Stansby for bringing the closed room to life for us!!|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|nt|stew: you were right Karen|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: let me check again...yes this is the real auction|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, east's spade ace makes it very unlikely that west is lurking waiting for a double :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: it is fun to do this,  if you (kibs) ever have a chance, I highly recommend you give it a try|pg||
nt|stew: now can he really make this?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=(4+/5+) @C & @D, 0-11 HCP   was also an option |pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Drew just asked how far ahead of the other room they were|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for EW  1@D-3@D = 9-11, INV, very good 6+@D|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Vugraphu8: this was alerted as key card|pg||
mb|d|nt|kareno: This lead will help!!|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: pure thievery now|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6D|nt|ahollan1: then again -- |pg||
nt|ritong: if 4@h is a sort of key ask, now situation is bizarre for sontag|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|stew: I hate the lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Thanks too, to the USBF (especially the organizer, Jan Martel) for allowing us to join in their tournaments!|pg||
nt|robinswr: don't know why a trump was led when it could be void|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: when he holds three keys and pard is interested with slam, he can t pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Drew asks about 4h Bates writes 0 or 3|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Bates writes while Drew thinks about lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd ask about 4N also|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kareno: Thanks to BBO for a fabulous platform for watching these great events week after week.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|robinswr: dummy could be void and guess what dummy is void|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kareno: To my fellow commentators for their wit and wisdom.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: still plenty of time to establish @S trick|pg||

nt|kareno: And of course to the specs for keeping us awake!!|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kareno: He must have been thinking of Allison's Law, circa 1962, "There's always a ruff in the dummy!!"|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: next version of bbo:  microphones at the vugraph table!!  (I hope)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|dQ|pc|h5|pg||
