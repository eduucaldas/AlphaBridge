mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|daman: EW are cold for 5@D|pg||
nt|daman: and NS might push them there|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South must expect that E-W can make something good in the red suits. Should he bid 3@S? No he has passed.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: very tempting for exactly that reason David|pg||
nt|daman: I would have bid 4@S over 3@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|daman: take an early chance|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT by East would have been difficult to beat.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South would need to lead a low spade, it seems, to beat 3NT by East.|pg||
nt|daman: and of he bid 4@S they were never finding 5@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: w thking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  let's you open one window per vugraph table|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Of course, South could simply lead his partner's suit (always recommended) and get a spade switch. |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that way you can watch the Closed Room and both tables from the Danish Event|pg||
pc|cA|nt|brolucius: No sensible player would lead a club after a 3NT bid (and a diamond overcall) when they were looking at A-K-Q-x-x-x in an unbid suit. But... well... several kibitzers tell me that ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: it is obvious.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so it took us all the way until Hand  1 before we have a potential swing|pg||

pc|d4|mc|11|nt|brolucius: Granovetter had a tricky decision over 4@D. His hand was pretty good, for a protective 3@D bid, but he did not like the look of his @CK under the opener.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Yes, the hands fit extremely well and there might, after all, have been a trump loser. Or a trump guess to make. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: this final is 90 boards -- 6-15 board segments, 4 today, 2 tomorrow|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|brolucius: Anyone overcalling 2@C, vulnerable, should be shot.|pg||

nt|brolucius: East can only play a diamond now, but even that may help declarer.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He needs to lead twice towards his spades.|pg||

nt|brolucius: If East keeps a bare @HA, he can be thrown in with it to play a spade. If instead he keeps two hearts. He can be thrown in with a spade to give a trick to dummy's @HK.|pg||
nt|daman: should be simple enough now|pg||

nt|daman: lovely 4@H here for EW|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|3H|nt|imp_jan: we call it over here the 'rotterdam' style of overcalling|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: All beginners book say that you should not even think of overcalling 2@C on such a suit, yet all experts tend to do it.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D=INV|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: more of a MP overcall than IMPs|pg||
nt|imp_jan: leufkens-westra used to do that, once in a while u go for a number, but u always have the initiative|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, he was lucky that East did not have a re-opening double.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: they played in @Cs EW in the CR    8 IMPs to Schwartz|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: or a canape with 5+@C where West makes negative dbl|pg||
nt|imp_jan: hard to reach 4@h in ew|pg||

nt|imp_jan: yes indeed, especially redbld :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had they bid 4@H, West's K-J-x-x suit would have been in spades instead of clubs. That is one of the annoying things about the game. |pg||

nt|stew: 2nt probably some sort of relay for a try - 3s said I don't care what it was|pg||
nt|ahollan1: earlier we saw  3@C=3@S, min -- I think that was Berk-Lair|pg||

nt|granovette: yes, very easy from where we sit :-) but when South doubled with not much in hearts, maybe it's b/c he has nothing else|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: Berk:  I thought you showed extra but it is close enough.  we avoided the 3N trap|pg||

nt|stew: as Larry points out it is wrong sided, but on relay auctions that is the price one pays|pg||
pc|d6|nt|granovette: yes, sometimes the wrong-sidedness is "random," as you said, but it seems to me to be more unlucky than lucky|pg||

nt|granovette: he's eying those spot cards, noticing dummy's seven and his six, and wondering how safe it is to put in the queen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good news -- @C finesse into safe hand     bad news -- using @S entry eliminates some options|pg||
nt|granovette: i think he needs the finesse.... percentage is against spades breaking|pg||
nt|granovette: if heart finesse wins, the hand is so easy; if he loses, he has spades or club finesse to fall back on|pg||

nt|granovette: he doesn't have to give up a spade now|pg||
nt|granovette: he just gives them a diamond; three clubs, three spades, two hearts, one diamond|pg||
nt|granovette: surely he doesn't think spades are breaking after 4-1 clubs|pg||
nt|poohbear: If lair plays a @s back Declarer prob needs to hook the @d 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: kibitzers screaming for duck of 2nd @C|pg||
nt|granovette: if hearts are 5-2 and they have the ace of diamonds, he might go down, but i don't think playing for spades to break is percentage|pg||

nt|vugraphu7: I think @D encourages  (North doesn't want a spade!)|pg||
nt|poohbear: Granovetter might need to get the @c Q out of his hand on the first lead of the suit|pg||
nt|granovette: mind you, it's unlike Ekeblad to play high card when he doesn't like the suit, but he didn't double 3D|pg||
nt|granovette: i think 3N bid shows the spade king for sure, so Ekeblad didn't have to deny it... maybe D9 will confuse MG|pg||

nt|vugraphu7: MG:  sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does ACBL have a rule against telepathy?|pg||

pc|c9|nt|poohbear: no guess in @h play @d first|pg||
nt|stew: yes but not until he discovers the diamond K|pg||
nt|granovette: declarer should play diamonds first to see where the king is, then make the heart play|pg||
nt|granovette: you got there first, Fred :-)|pg||
nt|granovette: and Barry|pg||
nt|lc: We (DB-LC) have a rule that when they bid and raise, you can't make PEN X at this level.   But, this isn't the kind of thing a non-regular pair discussed.|pg||

nt|lc: A few tournies a year.    Bye all.|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: bye Larry|pg||
nt|robinswr: an example of non partnership|pg||
nt|pab1: DB and ML played last year in this same event|pg||
nt|granovette: i think when partner makes a takeout double and you have four of the other major, you should bid it|pg||
mb|1C|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|pc|d2|nt|granovette: i just played in a tournament where matthew and i played in a 3-3 fit, where our teammates played in a cuebid, etc. and these are established partnerships - bridge is HARD!|pg||

nt|granovette: as i predicted, north-south remained steady after the 3NT debacle; i think you get to the point where "tragedies" don't faze you that much (you get used to them!)|pg||
nt|stew: i certainly have|pg||
nt|granovette: :-))|pg||

nt|pab1: can he bring this home, now?|pg||
nt|stew: i think  so|pg||
nt|robinswr: ruff a club and play trumps|pg||
nt|pab1: well that certainly works|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: Berk;  sorry (as he is thinking)|pg||
nt|robinswr: but what if trumps are 3-1|pg||
nt|stew: Peter, you should know by now that "what works" is obviously the correct line of play|pg||
nt|pab1: also, ruff a club, pitch a diamond on the heart, ruff a diamond, spade to ace, ruff another diamond, then lead a good club abd pitch the last diamond -- losing two trump tricks but ...|pg||
nt|pab1: no Diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: N taking a break while W thinking....says brb|pg||
nt|robinswr: for a cig|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other match this board was pushed at 4@S making|pg||
nt|granovette: who won the other match?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wolff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so looks like tomorrow 90 board final for USA1 slot will be Wolff vs Schwartz  the original 3 & 4 seeds [random seeding between the 2]|pg||
nt|granovette: matthew and russ won this last year - playing with lev-eisenberg, and milner-baze|pg||
nt|granovette: wolff and morse played very, very well|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: North not back yet, and West still thinking anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Ekeblad Granovetter will be playing in their THIRD Final within last month|pg||

nt|stew: yes survives 3-1 spades|pg||
nt|pab1: i suppose this works too?|pg||
nt|robinswr: has to avoid losing 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|granovette: i think it's classy that each player is playing his heart out til the very end....|pg||
nt|pab1: well, they don't know the margin is 28|pg||
nt|pab1: it does seem like they're all awake, etc.|pg||
nt|granovette: people who love bridge the most treat each hand with respect :-))|pg||
nt|robinswr: you never know what happened at the other table. It could be tied at this point|pg||
nt|granovette: right|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: If Berk makes this hand (he will) then the margin in the match is decided by the trump split on deal 46|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: MG says "sorry"|pg||
nt|stew: true JoAnna ,,, but there were a few others along the way|pg||
nt|granovette: we need the gong|pg||

nt|brolucius: The dealing program has not delivered any real slams in this session and will therefore not receive any bonus (some of its favorite oil).|pg||
