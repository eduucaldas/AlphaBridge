mb|3C|nt|ralfwil: For me it looks like a @d lead is the onlyway to make|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: declarer should have played a low diamond at trick 2 and ruffed  and taken discard   if west had dducked the 2nd diamond would have gone down     a kib spooted this|pg||

nt|ralfwil: WD EW!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: i'm not sure about that 3N...|pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: kind of gambling|pg||
nt|xenya: what do you think?|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2C+2D+ SA and a ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: Niels is known to be a "bidder" :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good evaluation by West with his three small hearts|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: common for 1M-2NT to show limit raise + |pg||
nt|raghavan: well bid without much fuss|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that is, a raise to 3M or better|pg||
nt|ady: seems 2NT here is a limit raise or better |pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|nt|xenya: both N and E are it seems|pg||

nt|lestergold: this could go well if declarer runsthe 9 of dims now|pg||

nt|raghavan: correctly stopped in 2NT = 3S+3H+2C |pg||

pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||

pc|d2|nt|raghavan: e Ave, lead that . since declarere may have singleton K in that suit|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|lestergold: presumably the dim play is completely marked by the bidding and lack of lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@h would have been a decent save|pg||

nt|ady: part score hand    lijkely 1NT e/w|pg||
nt|ralfwil: happy to find @sA on side|pg||
nt|april7: but the way the defnce was he didn't need it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score hand |pg||
nt|xenya: missed that somehow|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: e/w cold for heart game!|pg||
nt|lestergold: but hard to reqach|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after @hQ he must have bad thoughts about @sA|pg||
nt|april7: 1NT by N and E will X and then we will see|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: diamond contract for e/w looks best|pg||
nt|xenya: we know what 2@C means!|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: @Ds or a strong hand, i've been told|pg||
nt|april7: XX = @C?|pg||
nt|andyv:  south will bail out in @cs|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mmmakela: Mike is it allowed to have a weak option in 2 @C strong in UK?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: awkward for North over 1NT|pg||
mb|p!|nt|mdgraham: unless he has a natural 2@D available....|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: not that 2@D is likely to be much of a success|pg||
mb|2D|nt|suketbombi: lead down to 41 imps here but then there is a 1100 on bd 32|pg||
nt|raghavan: May lead C|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think so|pg||
nt|mdgraham: redouble can be used as a puppet to 2@C, in order to play in 2 of a minor |pg||
nt|april7: if its not forcing , W should pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which allows 2@C to be stayman, as other bids as system on |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: no-trump opening kept e/w out of bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: wello best defence will see this about 2 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: but e/w can make a dim contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: not normally|pg||
nt|mmmakela: neither in Finland|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: 47|pg||
nt|raghavan: Invitation which W will refuse |pg||
nt|ady: n/s  better in spades    but south has no good reason to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: yet as cards lie 5 frigid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt on W, but they will find their 4-4 in @h?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but a quiet finish to the auction|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's surprising|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: this can go down 3 on best defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: cash in right order maybe 3 off with a trump promoted|pg||
nt|xenya: who is to blame here, if anyone?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: must admit I wd've bid 4 as E|pg||
nt|lestergold: no one|pg||
nt|april7: but only 2 @D are in|pg||
pc|h6|nt|raghavan: Ca and High C|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|suketbombi: sorry even now it is 59 too many diartractions here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: with 1oo on bd 32 the match seems to be over |pg||
nt|suketbombi: 1100|pg||
nt|xenya: my opinion also|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|april7: and not even that, no entry to dummy|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c2|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|don paulus: benefit of preempts|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d4|nt|lestergold: after heart ruff dims cashed then ace and another club will do it|pg||
nt|raghavan: N may try to get 2 or 3 ruffs with small Diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: yes    might restrick to down 2    which will be no loss as e/w likely to maked 8 or 9 tricks in no-trumps|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|raghavan: what a defense!!|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|raghavan: 4th H declarer should ruff with Dj, ruff club etc |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like -1|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|raghavan: Trump promotion S10?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: shoudl hav cashed dims first but i still think its 3 off|pg||
nt|ady: east best to play Q@D|pg||
nt|raghavan: West should have played D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence has gone slightly astray, not playing a trump|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes I think West had the chance- probably holding to his 10 to 4 trumps|pg||
nt|ady: if east plays another club  and north plays 4th hearft   east can discard a spade    so still down 2|pg||
nt|raghavan: East may lead  club K? we do not know |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Knut Blakset|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: the game is a perfecto |pg||
nt|don paulus: this system was quite popular in B - Holland - 2 @c as weak @d or SF|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: it seems should be down 2  whichever|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Lars in the West seat is Knut's brother|pg||
nt|ady: hi Knut|pg||
nt|raghavan: WC Knot Blakset|pg||
nt|wolwerine: Hi evrybody|pg||
pc|s4|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|pelu: why dont u allowe a weak option in 2@C? - lets say why not a strong opyion : 2@c = weak @D or strong|pg||
nt|don paulus: nowadays more often 2@c weak with both majors - or SF|pg||
nt|raghavan: enter in H and throw S on CQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: few would reach it east's hnad is full o bholes how does he know that west'shand fits so perc|pg||
nt|xenya: low preempts, mind you -- if N hada been more active, he may have pushed EW to 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: fectly the q club is enormous|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: I now have cc for NS -- same as Graversen played in SanRemo -- 2@c is eighter strong or weak @d|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 1NT may be tight on a low diamond lead  |pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: except Diamonds - others are unevenly distributed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no real reaosn to go up with the @DQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I rather want to go -1 in 3nt than in 2@d on EW...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|april7: 4@S to be made with Q of @H as entry to @S finesse|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h by W on last hand looked to have a lot of play|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: multi from west|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anyway, we will see|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   need to avoid getting too high|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: heading for 4@H|pg||
nt|april7: E is endplayed on lead|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|lestergold: n/s cold for 4s but e/w only one off in 5c|pg||
nt|mmmakela: this looks interesting|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|wolwerine: 3 D should cool East down|pg||
mb|2S|nt|don paulus: repeat @h now ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Colleagues Can anyone tell us about the players - their standing in their country etc|pg||
nt|april7: best lead though not t:)o be found is Q of @C|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: this sequence guarantees that east does not have heart support|pg||
nt|raghavan: Don it is not repeating - going all the way to game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh well, so much for that prediction|pg||
nt|ady: South has some good defense with partner in the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: borderline double from south 2nd time round    shows hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: a vulnerable effort with that ropey spade suit 3h i think a level too high|pg||
nt|ady: this finesse would help|pg||
nt|wolwerine: As you can see NS play a light style with overcalls|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: it served itsb purpose pushing n/s probably too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3h a rather unsound back in|pg||
nt|lestergold: could have been humungously horrid east could have an even better hand with a spade misfit|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: both pairs play in the first division in Denmark - and have all 4 been playing for Denmark|pg||
nt|raghavan: Thanks Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: NS has especially been very good in pairs tournaments|pg||
nt|ady: no doubt the 9@S  will later be finessed|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  or small @c and @h switch|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andyv:  still down 1 |pg||
pc|hT|nt|raghavan: Jan can u tell us what system they play - I know weak NT + what?|pg||
nt|lestergold: south er likes it too much|pg||
nt|andyv:  9@h seems pretty dangerous lead in this auction|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer X on the first round showing @h. After that it´s up to N to  act. Also to be able to D 2@s for penalty|pg||
nt|lestergold: ouch|pg||
nt|mdgraham: needs to go to @S9 to take the diamond hook  |pg||
nt|april7: 10 tricks always|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c7|nt|ady: possibly down 3 |pg||

mb|p|nt|raghavan: Interesting from EW point of view|pg||

nt|lestergold: east will ultimately be able to make a K and another club by means of endplay so probably 2 off|pg||

mb|2H|nt|suketbombi: 3nt by NS but unlikely to be there 4@H dn 1  seems to normal|pg||

nt|wolwerine: Looks like 500|pg||
nt|andyv:  not just say it, he was adament about it.|pg||

nt|wolwerine: 3 NT with a heart lead is in trouble|pg||

nt|raghavan: going 1 down - 1C+3D+1S|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|raghavan: 2D|pg||
nt|april7: the least E can bid is 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: and they might get higher|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: another accurate prediction....|pg||
nt|andyv:  6 might have some play|pg||
nt|andyv:  certainly better than the 6C hand on 29|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: a good competive auction     n/s can make 10 tricks in diamonds on J@C guess|pg||
pc|c4|nt|wolwerine: Maybe South should bid 4@D. When West bids 3@S he normally has five so North should have a singleton|pg||
pc|c2|nt|suketbombi: yes he did open 1nt|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|s9|pc|hT|pg||

nt|april7: 12 tricks in @D|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ady: n/s   may get to 3NT    |pg||
nt|raghavan: time for 3NT by South|pg||
nt|april7: and also in NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I like 2@d from W. His best suit. I have seen many players bid 1@s on that hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  why not 3@s over 3@c?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: can make even on the best lead of a spade   with diamond position |pg||
nt|wolwerine: In the old days Hansen used to open 1@D with the South hand to avoid a diamond lead - now he has become more disciplined!?|pg||
nt|andyv:  pretty anemic bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Andy|pg||
nt|april7: but should bid also @S sometimes and not stop below slam|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: also heart finesse right|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't think this is a dummy I'd like to put down|pg||
nt|april7: if you see both hands with all those controls|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Perhaps 2@d is a transfer for @s so 3@d shows @d|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|wolwerine: Or maybe it's because people started leading his opening suit!|pg||
nt|ady: and spades 4-4    a number of fortunate situations for n/s|pg||
nt|pelu: No, Knut - Jørgen is just and old man now :)|pg||
nt|ady: also colubs breaking |pg||
nt|april7: but probably not the strengh W has|pg||
nt|andyv:  good point... next question... why would you not show your pattern if that is true?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6520 isn't usually a no-trump shape|pg||
nt|wolwerine: East-West is a new partnership and are apparently not on wavelength here|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|ady: clubs|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|april7: claim!!!!!|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|wolwerine: 2@D is natural and game forcing, 3@S second time would have been 4th suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@H-2@d-3@C isn't a particularly good start, as a lot of room is taken up  |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|wolwerine: Like You and me Peter - soon I can play the seniors with You!|pg||
nt|april7: but 3@C shows a good opening and not min|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pelu: better bid 1@D in N then west will attack with a smal @H|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|cA|mc|12|nt|pelu: Hi Knut - I lok forward to that :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  even if 4th suit, which makes less sense in GF auctions, W can still bid 4S later to complete his pattern|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agreed. West bids 3@S, East 3NT and now....4@S? |pg||
nt|april7: and E 6NT|pg||
nt|wolwerine: I know my brother thinks he has shown at least a good 6 card suit in diamonds. So in his opinion East should support with a doubleton and good controls|pg||
