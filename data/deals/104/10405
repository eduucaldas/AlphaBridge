mb|1S|nt|rv: the danger for Mohiuddin to re-open is partner will atleast give him 2n or may even bid game:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|ehsana: and can make it too on...a certain play|pg||

nt|rv: Subhash Gupte is called Guruji (teacher) or Tauji (elder) in Indian bridge circles for his seniority and bridge knowledge:)|pg||
nt|rv: is there a smoke break?|pg||

nt|yr: 1NT by E , unless NS wish to get involved here|pg||
mb|p|nt|buddyshah: must be a smoke break for E-w|pg||

nt|rv: Dhadi is on hot seat, he should get the lead right knowing second @s is unlikely to stand|pg||
