mb|d|nt|kit: The offbeat 1NT opening could steal N-S from 3NT|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu1: Berk explained to Russ that 2@d showed extra diamond length (I think - know he explained something)|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: Berk and lair switched seats for this set?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: of course Lair doesn't know that his partner was kidding, so he will probably bid 3@D|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: now the @d kills it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Hedy Grey|pg||
nt|korszurku: sorry - the 1N call means 15-17, but the length of the 5-th @H is always appreciated as an extra point|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: good afternnon|pg||
nt|korszurku: unless it is a very bad suit|pg||
nt|korszurku: of course the E hand is worth more than 16HCP, but they know that|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sundiszno: they always add one point for a 5-card suit|pg||
nt|korszurku: this hand is an absolute maximum for this bid|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|mug: small technical error|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|MolvaM: evet irfan ýlgýn ters zon durumunda girmemeyi tercih etti. bence makul|pg||
nt|MolvaM: gerçi 1 seviyesinde araya girmek konusunda oyuncular biraz daha atak olabilirler|pg||
nt|eerbil: erdem için pas demek çýlgýnlýk olabilir tabi :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice @D spots for declarer |pg||
pc|h8|nt|MolvaM: asýl tehlikeli seviye 2den sonra baþlýyor|pg||
nt|eerbil: bence olaðan bir araya giriþ eli, ters zon durumu olsa da|pg||

nt|sundiszno: why not letting it to the Q?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|namial1: @h or @d promote j @s|pg||
nt|kastan88: now need fast to switch on clubs, another way they will be thrown on diamonds|pg||
nt|mug: just looking at the suit in isolation anyway, admittedly you have to do a bit of crossing|pg||
nt|korszurku: but it is easy if you see all the hands...|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kastan88: but this will give additional club trick to declarer|pg||

pc|c3|nt|xenya: i don't see why E didn't duck 2nd @D though -- W could have 3?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|MolvaM: 1 seviyesinde rakibi kontrlamak çok cazip gelmez ama 2 seviyesinden itibaren herkes zonda araya giren rakipleri mahvetmek için fýrsat kollar|pg||
nt|sybarra: a good thought,  and I think E thought about doing so |pg||

nt|hedyg: 3@d= gf but does not show 5 @ds|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mtvesuvius: whoops|pg||
nt|mug: partner's 4@H doesn't have to be a strong hand, can just be a punt as here|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need Flash Player 9, some don't. ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Open one browser window per table|pg||
pc|c9|nt|asig: It looks as if NS can make 3@H|pg||
nt|kastan88: CC showing they use MultiLandy over 1NT, probably double with minor-suiter, but, who knows, not so much on CC|pg||
nt|asig: Sorensen considering a raise to 3@H|pg||
nt|vasanti: hello everybody|pg||
nt|asig: Good controls and trumps, but the distribution is pointing in the other direction|pg||
nt|ACBL:  Welcome Vasanti ..thanks :)|pg||
nt|asig: Hi vasanti|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Heya Jacki and Vasanti :)|pg||
nt|vasanti: :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: too flat hand, i would pass, as partner passed on 1st round too, would be disciplined|pg||
nt|vasanti: they do have noce sp fit|pg||
nt|hobakan: Rxx den mi yoksa V9x den mi?|pg||
nt|wwalter: will be 4@h :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and this may be -1 at the end of the dy |pg||
nt|xenya: the 3-level sacrifice is futile though|pg||
nt|sybarra: *day|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hobakan: derken..|pg||
nt|mug: so no need to double with zero defence|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://psbridge.gotdns.com/bbo/allvug/  - Vugraph Hand Records (PDF)|pg||
nt|blade: seems difficult to find that @h fit...|pg||
nt|korszurku: W was lazy not to play the @CK|pg||
nt|sundiszno: would you rise with the @cK?|pg||
nt|korszurku: oh, sry - the other one is dummy|pg||
nt|sundiszno: not an easy hand to defend|pg||
nt|korszurku: not that easy|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|vasanti: nice|pg||
nt|kastan88: Hi Vasanti and Jacki!|pg||
nt|asig: Yes, EW can make some spades|pg||
nt|vasanti: hi anders hi jaak|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu durumlarda genellikle bir 8. löve de bulunur bir yerlerden|pg||
nt|sybarra: now looking like -2 but maybe no double no trouble |pg||
nt|blade: and in this case its better not to find...|pg||
nt|sundiszno: rise with @cK, play @sT|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ovncylmz: thom, do u open with east hand? |pg||
nt|tomi2: i think not in imps, i save the time for the nex board|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: aha|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: same here|pg||
nt|asig: Enterprising lead|pg||
nt|kastan88: that is problem how to bid with 6minor+4major over opps 1NT not easy to find right part-score|pg||
nt|asig: 11 tricks possible now|pg||
nt|kastan88: and perhaps points on other side too, so no need to fight all the time :)|pg||
nt|asig: Draw trumps and set up clubs for to discards|pg||
nt|vasanti: some play x as minor +M|pg||
nt|z_lasu: hello all|pg||
nt|z_lasu: i suppose this vugraph is making from bridgerama not from the table so it is a little bit slow|pg||
nt|liviu123: hi all|pg||
nt|z_lasu: hi Liviu|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: yes, is from rama|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow|pg||
pc|s7|nt|namial1: Club lead i think|pg||
nt|korszurku: I imagined S playing - I have to modify my previous statement: it is DIFFICULT if you see all 4 hands :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: EW can't make much, 3@S should be down by a few|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 3@d was 5+ after all? and 3@H was meant as cuebid by W and as natural by E|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Hi All :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Hi guys|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk5: Good afternoon to Mikael Westerlund|pg||

nt|Vugraphztt: Heya Mike|pg||
nt|sundiszno: hi mikael - you must support poland :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|tomi2: I think N should bid 4@C|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: possible|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: do we have operator problems?|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: operator?|pg||
nt|mug: pass should not be forcing or in any way encouraging on this auction|pg||
nt|xenya: rather, EW can't make much on best defence|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: no, this is the playing speed :)|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: umm|pg||
nt|bily: i'm the new commentator|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: really slow|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: hi bily|pg||
nt|bily: hi|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: this should be claimed very fast|pg||
nt|mikael_w: :) why ?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ovncylmz: the thing that i ve seen in this table, they bid in 7-8mins, then leading takes 3-4mins, and auto-claim:)|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: i like this bridge:) declarer play and defence is hard|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 3@h ll make = or +1|pg||
nt|bily: +1 I mean|pg||
pc|cK|nt|wwalter: a small @d would be interesting , I ment that as a doubledummy joke|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mikael_w: 6 would probebly been made if they bid it, but now dec may play as safe as possible to make 5|pg||
nt|hedyg: making 12 tricks not obvious at all|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|wwalter: now should come the 10|pg||
nt|namial1: A :d lead  good gess by the mother of Lea|pg||
nt|z_lasu: 11 tricks and next one|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 nt maybe |pg||
nt|sundiszno: two hungarians here...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: hehehe, ok, Go Poland|pg||
pc|h4|nt|korszurku: Jassem-Tuczynski in the other room - sound like a very strong pair...|pg||
nt|korszurku: although I guess one generation younger (maybe two)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kastan88: now  if @Sk not right, need to look how to play against 4-1 in trumps - bu who has 4-card?|pg||

nt|mikael_w: btw|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Mikael :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|kastan88: in real you can see: NS have good @H partscore, But they found this only after opps fighting. Woukd East pass from reopen position and West would find @D lead (IMO impossible), ...|pg||
nt|kastan88: what then will be result|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h7|nt|hobakan: bu sefer fazla vermemeye azimli oyuncularýmýz|pg||
pc|h9|nt|eerbil: hem deklarasyondan hem de kötü karo daðýlýmýna karþý karo damý kuzey'de aranacak ve sorunsuz bi þekilde kontrat olacak|pg||
nt|MolvaM: deklaran karo kararýný geciktirmeye çalýþýyor ama eðer çok gecikirse karodan 2 kez empas atacak tempoyu kaçýrýp batabilir|pg||
nt|eerbil: Doðu, yalancý skuizin çalýþtýðýný görünce hesabý düzeltme konusunda ýsrar ediyor|pg||
nt|hobakan: dam trefl|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|sundiszno: now 170|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|sybarra: 5 @C, 2 @S, 2 or 3 @D and 1@H |pg||
nt|xenya: yes, sorry, i missed some of EW's cards|pg||
pc|h8|nt|MolvaM: örneðin trefl dönüldükten sonra karo as çekilirse deklaran yerde mahsur kalabilir|pg||
nt|hobakan: as karo çektireyimmi? :)|pg||
nt|eerbil: yapabilirmisin :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: þimdi hemen empas atmak zorunda yapmak için. as çekmeden.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sundiszno: the defense cannot cash the @s|pg||
nt|korszurku: Poland doing very well on 3@H vs 4@D deals :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|blade: good play by Zimmermann to duck twice and let E on play...|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d5|nt|mug: if they play otherwise they may change after this hand|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|asig: well done Sorensen|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: overtrick even|pg||
nt|mikael_w: even 5 can be a problem somerime|pg||
pc|s8|nt|yuval10: yes|pg||
nt|mikael_w: now they can|pg||
nt|sundiszno: it was wise not to bid 4@d, since 4@h would have been made practically|pg||
mc|9|nt|namial1: just made now|pg||
nt|kastan88: trumps went wrong, but occasionally @SK in right hand, so still at home|pg||
nt|mikael_w: no missclick now Bas ?|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 1@H can also include 5@H & 5@S|pg||
nt|lc: With strong @C, South can bid 4@H and put pressue on -- and hope no slam.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 4@H and any longer suit|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kit: nice when your canape opener hits partner's 6-bagger|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3H|mb|4C|nt|kit: But West will surely accept the transfer, won't he?|pg||
nt|lc: This kept E-W out of 4@S.|pg||
nt|lc: I was wondering if Lair would bid 4@S.  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: last set  Ek's 1@H opener on 4 to the deuce found RHO with AQJ10xxx|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S down't seem to quite fetch on my quick analysis|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Berk: "if you have a longer suit can it be spades?" Russ: "if I have a longer suit it can be anything; if I have just hearts it's at least 5"|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip: Note that he catches a pretty good dummy and still wrong to bid.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|kit: a good dummy would include the 9 of spades|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lc: So, now -2 with promotion.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kit: If South ruffs the third round of clubs high, this is a classic example of refusing to overruff|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: for specs:  In canape,  2nd suit bid is LONGER than the 1st suit bid|pg||

nt|Vugraphztt: Nope, I'm merely copying from the table operator though..|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yuval10: 5@h looks like down 1 or 2 at most, so N did well by not XX'ing|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok :)|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 4@h can be made here|pg||
mb|d|nt|blade: a thin 4@h here...but prob. noit reached...and with good def. 1 down...|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|korszurku: but N-S can save in 5@C|pg||
nt|sundiszno: for 500|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|asig: Likely diamond part score for EW here|pg||

nt|yuval10: @d's|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: ok|pg||
nt|blade: ich grüße mal alle deutschen specs zwischendurch...HEYYYYYYYY..:)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: No game can be made here|pg||
nt|hedyg: even 2NT is too high here with best defense|pg||
nt|hedyg: on a @s lead or @d he can make this|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: they play transfers here|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I was about to mention that :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, the defense must hurry up taking their tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@S, A@D, @s to dummy and J@d|pg||
nt|korszurku: 3@H is not good|pg||
nt|korszurku: but maybe he will get another chance :)|pg||
nt|korszurku: Zsolt (Wagner) did not appreciate his 6-4 enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|sundiszno: 6-4's are very good|pg||
nt|korszurku: I beleive with these cards it is normal to jump to game, but if you are pessimistic at least invite|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|asig: or NT|pg||
nt|kastan88: and lot of tricksin @D perhaps 10-11|pg||
nt|kastan88: in 1nT probably 9 tricks, I think South not attacking spades|pg||
nt|vasanti: 1nt is not too bad either  |pg||
nt|namial1: difficult to reach 5 @c and win it|pg||
nt|kastan88: what was 1@S? transfer to clubs?|pg||
nt|namial1: 2 down with @s ruff|pg||
nt|kastan88: then probably East could bid 5@C|pg||
nt|blade: very agressiv this 4@h bid...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|eerbil: kör ataðýna batan bir 4pik seyredeceðiz þimdi|pg||

pc|cQ|pg||
nt|eerbil: 13 var güneyde|pg||
nt|korszurku: 3@h is not invitational|pg||
nt|mikael_w: nice decision by S here to pass 3@h, Not sure I would do that, but W would for sure bid 4 @h over 4@c|pg||
pc|s9|nt|MolvaM: bizce koz ataðý iyi|pg||
nt|yuval10: note that N didn't overcall|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ovncylmz: 4@h made?|pg||

nt|ozgull: irfan ve muhammet oldukça yavaþ oynayan bir çift ancak sanþlýyýz ki latvia lýlarýn yavaþ oynayan ayaðý diðer masada|pg||

pc|hA|nt|ovncylmz: what do you thk about hands?|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: i thk good hands for bridge|pg||
nt|mug: remember that declarer doesn't know which way round the heart honours lie|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kastan88: Website for official results and running scores: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Results.htm|pg||
nt|mug: I would have thought you cross to @DA and play a club to the jack|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: now he does|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think K@D and @d to the ace, then @c to the jack|pg||
nt|yuval10: everything works here for declarer|pg||
nt|mug: will probably guess wrong as North passed over 1@C|pg||
pc|h6|nt|eerbil: eðer ortaðýnda 2 trefl varsa, beklemeli ve 3 trefl, bir kör (veya karo) almak için|pg||

pc|h3|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h7|nt|yvonnebrid: a|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well they missed the grand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: East thought they were an ace off it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Robert didnt show his void|pg||
nt|hedyg: will he play security again and just cash out?|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|vasanti: 3nt in closed room overbid|pg||
nt|eerbil: evet bilse 4 trefli, kör tek þansý|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure how to avoid a @H and @C loser here |pg||
nt|mikael_w: so this will be 8 fast now|pg||
nt|sundiszno: Zsolt must be disappointed seeing @hs 2-2|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kastan88: Denmark and Germany now on 3.-4. place with 101 VP (after 6 rounds). 1. Netherlands - 110 VP; 2. France - 105 VP:|pg||
nt|xenya: this won't be a success -- with 2 keycards missing|pg||
nt|sybarra: on previous hand,  the @D ace sits with the doubleton heart,,  so we will see where the other room plays it |pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahalim: this contract depends on the @d's|pg||
nt|blade: this defence will not go to the books on defence...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ovncylmz: these hands really testing player levels|pg||
nt|kastan88: but as cards lie always 9 tricks: 4@D+2@H+2@C+1@S|pg||
nt|kastan88: Eurpean Youth Champs, Girls' class, 7th round. 14 teams, round robin.|pg||
nt|asig: Denmark scored 3 x 25 yesterday after a terrible start|pg||
nt|asig: but are now back into contension|pg||
nt|kastan88: IMO terrible was only 1 match, and probablu only 3 boards by -12-13 IMPs, and you have lost|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|z_lasu: in other case declarer establish diamonds before defenders take clubs|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mtvesuvius: The spades work nicely for declarer, but with the bad @s guess this cannot make|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but it's difficult to show a void in partner's first suit|pg||
nt|blade: partner will not underlead an ace..so it was very easy def.-- for sure 13 imps away|pg||
nt|blade: maybe some less if they dont bid to game...|pg||
nt|blade: now its too late to think  Mrs...:-(|pg||
nt|hedyg: make your contract and worry about the overtricks AFTER|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mtvesuvius: now a finesse against the T@C also|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|sundiszno: now he must strongly suspect @s9 was a singleton|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|mtvesuvius: @d guess*|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mtvesuvius: and declarer has the rest on a squeeze|pg||
nt|blade: but its not easy allways when you play with 4 players ( nearly)...sometimers you lose concentration...3rd match a day...|pg||
pc|d3|pg||

nt|hedyg: noooooooooooo|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and dec also KNOW that if @c are 5-3 2NT was always down from start|pg||
nt|hedyg: Florin did this really happen?|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: NO NO, misclick :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: phewwwwwwwwww|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D is NF|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: No way Granovetter can raise this.|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: that can't be right|pg||
nt|ahalim: if the play went as shown, he shd be 1 down|pg||
nt|ahalim: this shd be an easy 4@H making 5|pg||
nt|eerbil: 1@d-1!-1@s deklaresini dengesiz el oynayanlar için þanssýz bir el, o durumda defans biraz daha kolay gözüküyor|pg||
nt|eerbil: @h|pg||
nt|MolvaM: þu an masamýzda oldukça çok sayýda yorumcumuz var. bu bakýmdan yorumcu olma taleplerini þu an için pas geçiyoruz. ilginize teþekkürler|pg||
nt|murat: Letonyalýlar'ýn böyle birþey oynayacaðýný sanmýyorum abi :)|pg||
nt|namial1: With North opening they play game|pg||
nt|wwalter: I would not open this one|pg||
nt|namial1: the same for me|pg||
nt|mug: marking the aces|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: right|pg||
nt|hedyg: no bad jokes pls :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: i was trying to claim...|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|sundiszno: not a good start for the hungarians|pg||
mb|p|nt|namial1: they opened in both rooms|pg||
nt|wwalter: this will not end @@ 2@h :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: young blood :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: routine @h game here for NS|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here its importent dor N/S NOT to bid to hi|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yo_yo: I still feel Robert should have shown more though|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4@h is nice and easy|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mtvesuvius: Wrong colors for a minor save|pg||
nt|vasanti: sld be 2 imps gain|pg||
nt|kastan88: 4@S for NS|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 2@h?|pg||
nt|korszurku: very interesting - on board 1 and 3 E doubled diamonds (seemingly natural) and in both cases W lead a spade in the OR|pg||
nt|sundiszno: or 3?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|tomi2: "closed room"|pg||
nt|ahalim: right|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: So yes, 4 (or maybe 5) hearts making 5 is pretty much a claim|pg||
nt|peachy: nice aggressive game, imps for sweden|pg||
nt|korszurku: in both cases it was quite essential to beat 4@H|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 2 @s might even be to hi for N/S here|pg||
nt|korszurku: good opening leader Jassem|pg||
mb|2S|nt|laurentiu: hi everybody from Romania|pg||
nt|wwalter: the pass users, R all over 40 :)|pg||
nt|blade: its important now to forget this boad!..hope North will shut up and play further..he is unfortunatly known NOT to do this.-..|pg||
nt|korszurku: 1NT might be Polish style|pg||
nt|korszurku: 4@S and 5+ in a minor|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 4@c in the open from the last one|pg||
mb|p|nt|ovncylmz: what is X?|pg||

nt|vugraphztt: Hi there! A commentator was badly needed, thx|pg||
nt|peachy: hi kibitzers|pg||
nt|mikael_w: a posible 4 @h here, and will be fun ro see if it makes|pg||
mb|3S|nt|laurentiu: and also from our distinguished guests from Europe, and spectators from Terra :)|pg||
nt|ahalim: W shd investigate, he needs only @H AK|pg||
mb|p|nt|bily: unknown suite|pg||
nt|vasanti: there would be competetion with those @H|pg||
nt|vasanti: everyone bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|bily: i think|pg||
nt|asig: 2@c is artificial, showing any invitational hand and asking opener to bid 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: double now is wrong without trump tricks and minimum, IMO, if this is not some artificial|pg||
nt|asig: Dbl is very ill advised as 2@h is unbeatable|pg||
nt|eerbil: 3nt neden açýlmadý merak ediyorum|pg||
nt|MolvaM: muhammet özgür rakiplere olasý bir 4 majör kontratý olduðundan þüpheleniyordu ama ortaðý gereðinden çok majör kart bulunduruyor elinde|pg||
nt|z_lasu: no double, no trouble here|pg||
nt|z_lasu: but still -300 not looks great|pg||
nt|z_lasu: Romanian pair stop in 2@s at board 4|pg||
nt|mug: 3@H is a bit bow-and-arrow|pg||
nt|mug: many pairs these days play transfers or some kind of 2@C tool |pg||
nt|peachy: i am not familiar with the players' systems, if a kibitzer knows, feel free to msg me|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Both natural|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT showing long @ds + 4 @s|pg||
nt|mikael_w: strage 1 NT here ? maybe it shows 4@s and longer @d|pg||
nt|hedyg: it does|pg||
nt|mikael_w: looks like it after N 2 @s|pg||
nt|sundiszno: looks like at least 5 tricks for the defense|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mtvesuvius: wow|pg||
nt|z_lasu: so 10 more imps to Poland|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, ATLEAST|pg||
nt|sundiszno: not now...|pg||
nt|korszurku: 3@S bid consistent with my comment about 1NT|pg||
nt|mikael_w: but they menage ro get the kontract on the right hand|pg||
pc|h5|nt|asig: And 5@S making your own way|pg||
nt|vasanti: looks like they not reaching game|pg||
nt|peachy: as the cards lay, Michielsen will make this, mebbe even four|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Cecilia (Cilla) Rimstedt is West, the younger of the two sisters|pg||
nt|peachy: she played with Emma yesterday, is that right?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I think she is 20, Sandra 22|pg||
nt|Walddk3: No, that is Sandra|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H competitive, non-invite|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mtvesuvius: That cannot be a winning bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 1NT would show about 18 with me,  so Robert is expecting miracles I think|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Perhaps a little confusing, but  Sjöberg - Sandra Rimstedt  and  Grönkvist - Cecilia Rimstedt  are regular partnerships|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 1  Israel found the slam  so off to a good start for them |pg||
nt|xenya: well a @D now looks very natural|pg||
nt|xenya: no doubt, S is considering other possibilities|pg||
nt|sybarra: why not?|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kastan88: what to think with South hand, if partner saying, I have lot of heart tricks? So probably double was something, or South knowing partner doubling sometimes without tricks :)|pg||
nt|vasanti: young blood wants to draw blood:)|pg||
nt|kastan88: even 3@H is good sacrifice, as 4@S stay and 3@H only 1 down|pg||
nt|vasanti: loke jaak says ill advised|pg||
nt|vasanti: like|pg||
nt|asig: Even 5@h is a good save :)|pg||
nt|vasanti: kx and 2 aces also guaranteed shortage in @H in ps hand 3sp was better now?|pg||
nt|kastan88: North putting partne under pressure: why she is doubling without trump tricks?|pg||
nt|vasanti: 3@D from s might still save their game|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: EW are already in 3@H :)|pg||
nt|asig: 3NT now to collect the vul game bonus?|pg||
nt|vasanti: u true:)|pg||
nt|asig: And a matchpoint top|pg||
nt|MolvaM: belki 3nt açýþýnda "yanda birþey yok" oynuyorlardýr?|pg||
nt|eerbil: 4.pozisyondan öyle oynamýyorlardýr herhalde|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu elikontrsuz oynuyor olmamýz gayet iyi|pg||
nt|eerbil: bi önceki boardda, koz ataðýndan sonra 4@s kolayca yapýlmýþ|pg||
nt|murat: Letonyalý gençleri biraz biliyorum.. Son 5 senedir oldukça iyi çalýþtýrýldýlar. özellikle þu an oynayan 4lüsünden gelecek için çok ümitliler.. |pg||
nt|yo_yo: and one happened :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|yo_yo: Bad luck Houlberg, it sounded as if EW were well stopped in @S|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 3 @s might also make|pg||
nt|mikael_w: @dQ now ?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: then he makes 3 @s|pg||
nt|sundiszno: the @d and the @s finnesses are somehow linked|pg||
nt|sundiszno: W wont have @cAK, he'd lead it|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|blade: lets see if they reach a grand..and then...which one....|pg||
nt|mikael_w: but will not be easy|pg||
nt|hedyg: @c lead best?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vasanti: oh no|pg||
nt|kastan88: 3Nt is possible only if spades are running, but North bidding showing something else|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yo_yo: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Kath :)|pg||
nt|sundiszno: he has @hK|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahalim: this I don't understand, so easy to check for keycards and stop in 5@H |pg||
nt|blade: 7@c down for sure...7@h also has big problems, cuase no communication....and of course with @c ruff down from the top...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: or @c turn after @h A|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is more difficult|pg||
nt|hedyg: can Quentin find it?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|vasanti: N really has nothing more than opening hand this is bad|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|mikael_w: what ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H now to show @c interest|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: wrong three|pg||
nt|mikael_w: there is more then one way to play this|pg||
nt|hedyg: @d to hand and @H ruff, @d and @H..K@D|pg||
nt|mikael_w: that is ONE way|pg||
nt|sundiszno: so if he has one, the other may not|pg||
pc|sK|nt|blade: oh...|pg||
nt|blade: if norway is lucky...this will brings lots of imps if germans bid to 7....|pg||
pc|s8|nt|peachy: this will be a likely 800|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hedyg: of @s after last @H ruff|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d4|nt|peachy: but if other table bids game, loss not very great|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: 4@h has been bid in the OR|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: in the meantime ms Michielsen is still thinking|pg||
nt|peachy: if lucky, Grönkvist might excape with -500|pg||
nt|peachy: escape|pg||
nt|peachy: I am slightly speechless at the daring 4C|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: the screen has been closed and the players are talking on each side|pg||
nt|peachy: Florin, our operator told 4H was bid in other room. Shouldn't make so Sweden will lose 12|pg||

nt|yuval10: lead @c and declarer did very well to play A|pg||
nt|yuval10: but lost it somewhere along the way|pg||

nt|mikael_w: trying not to support any team m8 :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: OR playing 3@HX, last board|pg||
nt|mikael_w: But that was a false claim right ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: i think i'd want to be in 4@S on that hand after this bidding|pg||

nt|xenya: but never mind|pg||
nt|hedyg: it served no other purpose|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mtvesuvius: Partscore here|pg||
nt|mikael_w: playing the 10@s at the end is terrible play, The K@s is right. IF rhe @sQ is alone|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ovncylmz: here 3nt:= they like playing|pg||
nt|kastan88: this time North not so aggressive :)|pg||
nt|asig: Germany indeed bid 4S on 5|pg||
nt|vasanti: E hand is more like 4/5@C opening and iff ines chest|pg||
nt|sundiszno: if north passes, pass is no an option for csaba here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: disciplined pass by Gronkvist  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: 3@d isn't too bad actually, and certainly a good "save"|pg||
nt|vasanti: off ones forgive bad typing|pg||
nt|yuval10: E had 3 options - 3@h/ 2@h and pass|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 2NT game-forcing with 4+ hearts       4@D   5-5|pg||
nt|Walddk3: That will make Rimstedt stay away from the D lead one would assume|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Molenaar did not have that info in the other room and led @DK, but the contract went down regardless|pg||

nt|sundiszno: well, we told them beforte the event that tere are bonuses for games...|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: Yes, my apologies|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kastan88: now i think East can't stop  West to bid slam, or...|pg||
nt|vasanti: S s 2sp rather aggressive|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps some writing taking place|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 2nd chance|pg||
nt|mikael_w: is it posible to change it ? so we gets the IMP:s right ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: I corrected it|pg||
nt|sundiszno: anyway, it'll be a lot of imps to poland|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ty, Looks like the Hungarians miss another game here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|tomi2: dont know their agreements but one of both misbid his hand|pg||

nt|MolvaM: özgür artýk 5@h dese iyi olur sanýrým|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 1@h açþý gayet makul idi. sonra agresiv bir 4@d ve artýk þimdi fren rica edelim|pg||
nt|eerbil: 5@h dese de irfanýn pas demesi çok zor artýk|pg||
nt|blade: sometimes I wonder..they bid games with combined 21-22 -23 points with no fit..but this one is missed...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: hmm. Treating that as invitational just doesn't look right|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well the missed Grand was flat|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that means a "push" to you shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not an easy grand to bid do you think?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not easy, void in partner's suit  never easy|pg||
nt|sundiszno: they have a chance still|pg||
mb|p|nt|eerbil: çünkü AK treflin dýþarda olmasý neredeyse imkansýz irfan'ýn elinden|pg||
nt|ozgull: pass geçmeyecek olsa 4sp dermiydi|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was actually in other room with some of that discussion |pg||
nt|sybarra: need our wits about us on this 3 nt |pg||
nt|yuval10: he went for the only non-juniorish option :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: But also very effective, taking up valuable bidding space|pg||
nt|vasanti: sure finds p with good fit|pg||
nt|kastan88: occasionally not right red K in West hand|pg||
nt|eerbil: zaten 4sp demesi de normal deðil ki|pg||
nt|z_lasu: 2@h looks interesting here|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure this is our best spot |pg||
nt|xenya: tough hand for NS -- it appears all game contracts fail here|pg||
nt|sundiszno: :(|pg||
pc|hA|nt|namial1: a lot of down here|pg||
nt|wwalter: I will not say a word till the end LOL|pg||
nt|korszurku: 2@S is a bit timid|pg||
nt|mikael_w: verry|pg||
nt|sundiszno: yes, he may suspect partner's short in @h|pg||
nt|korszurku: but if you do bid 2@S, 3@H is better at the next turn|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|murat: karo ataðýna, tref dama doðru oynasa  6 olmuyor mu ? iki tur çekip durmasý yeterli|pg||

nt|yo_yo: yes it looks hopeless if you are of a pessimistic natuer|pg||
nt|namial1: i prefer 1 NT opening|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d was gf|pg||
nt|mikael_w: as he played now it dosent matter if rhe A@s is bare|pg||
nt|sundiszno: may be natural too :)|pg||

nt|yuval10: declarer has a lot of work to do here....|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The Dutch a little lucky here because even 4@H rates to go down|pg||
nt|peachy: what would you lead from W?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Maybe a low heart although I can see that a spade is fine|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|yo_yo: now for the @H switch|pg||

nt|yuval10: 3@h by E should show some @d preference|pg||
nt|yuval10: so W did very well to play @d rather than @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice 9@H in dummy|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Not sure I like rhe @sA lead here. I guess he hoped for single @s whith his parner, but not verry likely|pg||
nt|hedyg: very unlikely|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: he might be looking for a way to make with a 4-1 @h split|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahalim: Hi Peter all the way from Australia|pg||
nt|murat: diðer masa 4de durdu|pg||
nt|MolvaM: acaba batýnýn yan rengi trefl olabilir mi?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: o zaman trefl çakasý tehlikesi var|pg||
nt|MolvaM: dolayýsý ile trefl dönüþüne as girmek zorunda kalacak|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@C looks nice -- until you discover the 4-1 trump split|pg||
nt|sybarra: right |pg||
nt|xenya: or 3N, yes, Shirley|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|petergill: I think East liked his @DAJ 9 positioned over the 2@D bid, so East pushed towards a possible vulnerable game with the aggressive 3@H call.|pg||
nt|asig: Still one off|pg||
nt|vasanti: almost there but sadly dk wrong|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this was a REALY tough kontrakt from start|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|s4|nt|mikael_w: and if he makes it, it will be a realy good score|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: True, although I don't think it's strong enough anyway|pg||
nt|petergill: 9 tricks look possible if West continues to play it well|pg||
nt|petergill: @C10 looks best now|pg||
nt|ahalim: and if @H's were 3-2 even 10|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: true|pg||
nt|murat: güney karo rua çýktý.. muhtemelen 1 imp vereceðiz|pg||
nt|aupillon: test|pg||
nt|yuval10: now @h ruff and @c|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|yuval10: def. will have to open @s for declarer|pg||
nt|yuval10: or give a ruff and discard|pg||
nt|yuval10: so -1 it will be|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|laurentiu: Diana and Lucian ... is a new pair ... starting to play togheter since the end of previous year|pg||
nt|petergill: then he should play the strong bidder North for the ace, not the queen, of clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: looks like it is 1 down. |pg||
nt|blade: germans in 7@h next door...we will see if they can make that...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ovncylmz: -4?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: right, then it has overtricks when @hs split|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes|pg||
nt|blade: in the previous board|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hedyg: he could draw trumps, play all @ss and give up 2 @ds|pg||
nt|mikael_w: strange to play @h2 to ruff, Why not @hJ|pg||
pc|s7|nt|aupillon: Hello all. I am arriving on a Grand slam :)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|petergill: These young Israeli players are very strong - I think all of them are World Champions from 2006 in Bangkok.|pg||
nt|petergill: Dror Padon has done well to discard his @Ds to remove declarer's entry to dummy|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|peachy: kibs say should have eliminated clubs and spades first.  |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|aupillon: good and straightforward bidding|pg||
nt|aupillon: for a push|pg||
nt|pelepele: hi|pg||
nt|aupillon: Hello Charles. Nice boards here...:)|pg||
nt|z_lasu: now down 1|pg||
nt|hedyg: well not quite..|pg||
nt|sundiszno: why not pull trupms first, the ruffing finnesse is almost certain|pg||
nt|mikael_w: he knows K@h is at S|pg||
pc|cK|nt|z_lasu: he should play hearths earlier, but maybe not suppose that hearths are 3-3 after 2@h bid|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c9|nt|xenya: well perhaps 4@H had a practical chance |pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer needed to ruff a @c now|pg||
nt|sybarra: but @H's did not behave well enough |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|ovncylmz: aggressive bidding sometimes loses|pg||
nt|poohbear: and exit a trump|pg||
nt|mikael_w: no, but he will make 4|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and now he will be endplayed in his hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@h looks like making|pg||
nt|yuval10: if declarer guess @h|pg||

nt|xenya: right|pg||
nt|poohbear: can now do it|pg||
nt|lokaty: hello everyone:)|pg||
mc|10|nt|asig: I think the bidding clearly called for a spade lead - but S survived|pg||
pg||
qx|o7|st||md|1SKQ975HK864D9C932,SJ863HQ932DAQT62C,SA42HA7DK875CAKT5,STHJT5DJ43CQJ8764|sv|b|nt|lc: Looks like N-S will reach 4@H and we see if E-W save.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Berk: "I could have bid 3@c, I lose 2 spades, 2 hearts, 2 clubs ..." Lair: "I could have beaten it with a diamond out and a heart back"|pg||
nt|kit: two balanced hands, two distributional hands.  Let's see who bids the most.|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe E-W "save" is a make?  Lots of handling in 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: We're still waiting for Russ to get back from his smoke break - now he's here|pg||
nt|lc: 1@S  2@H  2@S,  then South drives to 4@H and E-W ...  we'll see.|pg||
nt|kit: West hand is good example of:  When you are void in their suit, bid one more than you think you should.|pg||
nt|lc: Also, when in doubt bid 4@S over 4@H|pg||
nt|lc: Although 4@H is down, so ...|pg||
nt|kit: and when you have spades, there is never doubt :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|lc: So, 3@H blows E-W out.  Must be intermediate.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: Sutherlin also overcalls 3@H|pg||
nt|lc: Is there any chance of this making?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s3|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lc: Not now, anyway.|pg||
nt|chip: certainly not now.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kit: East very luck that the lead didn't cost a trick.  Just because partner bid the suit, doesn't mean he has the king.|pg||
nt|lc: You wouldn't lead a spade, Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: well, I would lead a spade before I would lead a heart|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ: "you play upside down?" Berk: "we play first discard is odd/even"|pg||
nt|kit: so I guess that makes it my third choice|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kit: I like my aces to capture their honors|pg||
nt|lc: I'd lead a @S before I'd guess a minor and watch declarer throw @S and have partner look at me with his @SKQJ10x and ask why I didn't lead one.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lc: And Berk, would have a sly, sarcastic way of making the point.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|sA|pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|lc: "If I bid DIAMONDS, would you have led a @S????"|pg||
nt|chip: I'd lead a spade from this hand. Then if right to lead a minor will more likely know which one.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|kit: partner can just as easily have minor-suit strength -- he did open the bidding.  |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lc: On this hand, a @D was nearly fatal (allowing @S pitches).|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||
mc|9|nt|ahollan1: some specs asking what you think of 1@S-4@H |pg||

nt|petergill: 2005|pg||
nt|ahalim: before Bangkok then|pg||
nt|vasanti: one almost forgets one is watching juniors really agressive bidding and thoughtful play|pg||
nt|namial1: same contract in open room|pg||
nt|namial1: 5 @d best contract|pg||
nt|wwalter: the boad was normal, counting the points|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|Walddk3: Good morning to Shirley Ybarra|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm from a very bridge summer day in Wash. DC |pg||
nt|sybarra: make that *bright |pg||
nt|Walddk3: and good afternoon to Daniel Gulyas|pg||
nt|gulyas: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Daniel |pg||
nt|gulyas: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|gulyas: are we having a break now? looks like CR is way ahead of the OR|pg||
nt|sybarra: are we stuck?|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: no, small break|pg||
nt|hedyg: wd with a bit of help|pg||
nt|mikael_w: THAT was an expensive lead for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: @H lead was best|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here we have a realy strong hand whith S but they can make nothing at all|pg||
nt|korszurku: and a disaster on bd 6 in OR|pg||
nt|korszurku: for Hungary that is|pg||
nt|sundiszno: -730 is not a good thing |pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, but the Under 21 section started only in 2006, at World Championship level|pg||
mb|p|nt|laurentiu: probably ... the only feasable way to rich that slam is to dbl with Diana's Hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello again Lukasz|pg||

nt|korszurku: sry, bd 5|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sybarra: I like being in the "speed" room |pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: routine 3NT for NS here|pg||
nt|asig: And swingy boards :)|pg||
nt|asig: almost 7 imps per board|pg||
nt|aupillon: spade contract seems superior but there are some bad news|pg||
nt|yo_yo: here's a 20-20 hand|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4@h is off on the @c split here|pg||
nt|mikael_w: lol. I started to think I had lost it when you said board 6 ?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|wwalter: will make 5 or 7 :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: cards do not change so can only think but so much |pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Ed :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello Ed|pg||
nt|peachy: auction same as open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|liviu123: 2@S by W in open Room|pg||
nt|eerbil: içerde rua karo ataðýndan sonra oynayan piki verdi, sonuç olarak geçtiðimiz el de egale gitti|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Nielsen hasnt a bid |pg||
nt|mikael_w: here is a typical board where its realy nice ro play strong @c|pg||
nt|sundiszno: reverse flannery here|pg||
nt|korszurku: bd 6 was not good either, but the fault is in this room|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 4+ hearts, 5 spades, inv-|pg||
mb|4S|nt|peachy: reasonably:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: 3@h mü kontr mu? yoksa ne?|pg||
nt|eerbil: EW 3@s yapýyor, NS 3@h'ü ise trefl ataðýna 1 batýyor|pg||
nt|hobakan: 3 Trefl|pg||
nt|pelepele: 3nt maybe ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not an easy bid for S,  |pg||
nt|gulyas: The x probably shows @H, as a xfer sequence|pg||
nt|gulyas: my guess:)|pg||
nt|othered1: might double have specifically shown @H?|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe so |pg||
nt|Walddk3: and the obvious 4 losers|pg||
nt|blade: another thhin game....|pg||
nt|blade: looks like there is no defence against....maybe on a @d lead you get problems|pg||
nt|hedyg: better to play kokish here and be able to stop in 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: and Barry|pg||
nt|sybarra: a "calm" hand compared to the others we have seen so far|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hi Vlad|pg||
nt|lokaty: yes, but only @D lead defeat 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.pattayabridge.com/conventions/KokishRelay_main.htm|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice 7@D in S hand...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahalim: now slam time|pg||
nt|aupillon: looking at @d position, Nt is MUCH better|pg||
nt|aupillon: look upon the club problem for 3NT now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but he decided he had extras|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt I would find the 2 @S call |pg||
nt|sundiszno: now he shouldn't ruff the @c lead|pg||
nt|sundiszno: if csaba wuill ead a @c|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ovncylmz: hmm|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yet another slam for NS|pg||
nt|yo_yo: nor me  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: lets see if his play justifies his bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: E finding it interesting that his pard has the A |pg||
nt|gulyas: anyway, they stayed away from the @H contract, a good start:)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ovncylmz: junior bridge rulez|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: do you agree?|pg||
nt|eerdvegas: strange, just a normal game here|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 24hcp?|pg||
nt|eerdvegas: well I think all national squads would bid here the game|pg||
nt|poohbear: In the Polish @c system how would West force to game if he wanted to?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lokaty: 1C 1@D 2@D is any GF|pg||
nt|blade: 11 imps to norway for staying in 5@h, where 7@h is nearly 95%...bad luck...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: if E turn to @h now I rhink you shod try the @h finess at ones|pg||
nt|hedyg: he must|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT might dampen North's slam ambitions|pg||
nt|ahalim: and an easy one to play|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@c = cue - 1st or 2nd round control|pg||
nt|ahalim: you simply cannot misquess @D's :)|pg||
nt|ahalim: sry misguess|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT = non-serious about slam, hence 4@S cue later, since 3NT had already said that his hand was poor, so 4@C was a most serious slam try indeed|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S = 1st or 2nd round spade control, denies 1st or 2nd round @D control due to bypassing 4@D, hence North needs to think now, knowing no @Da opposite|pg||
nt|hobakan: :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: but 4@s will be interesting|pg||
nt|yuval10: and here it comes|pg||
nt|poohbear: ok|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mtvesuvius: The leaders at the moment are 1. Norway with 101 VPs 2. Germany with 95 VPs 3. France with 91 VPs|pg||
nt|petergill: North decides slam is a finesse and trump break at best, i.e. less than the required 50% |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Tarnovski now wants to sign off|pg||
nt|aupillon: 3NT would have been best as 3rd South bidding|pg||
nt|othered1: Wonder why east didn't lead partner's suit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: even it was not a transfer sequence, (just a plain neg. X)   not sure what I would bid with S |pg||
nt|gulyas: good Q, he knew that pd had a singleton|pg||
nt|sundiszno: that starts to be a lot of imps to the poles...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mikael_w: A1H and then AKJ in @s|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h4|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4 as dýþarýda iken zor|pg||
nt|MolvaM: muhtemelen 1 batacaðýz|pg||
nt|eerbil: doðu'nun bu trefli boþlamasý gerekirdi|pg||
nt|aupillon: but O/W have to take tricks QUICK|pg||
nt|aupillon: E/W*|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would rather bid my AKx than my xxx:)|pg||
nt|mug: North appreciated his golden cards in partner's suits|pg||
nt|yuval10: small @h now... and declarer will play A@h and another one|pg||
nt|sundiszno: It is to be correct to try to shorten the long trump holding|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tomi2: in OR both players downgraded their hands|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I can't believe thety are still playing the hand|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Did everyone fall asleep, Florin?|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: seems it was a revoke on clubs, director at table|pg||
nt|peachy: either that or everyone went for a Coke|pg||
nt|blade: hopefully board 6 brings us 12 back...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: then he has 8 tricks atleast|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bily: thx all go to work bye|pg||
nt|tomi2: west opened 1@S that could be light in a strong club system and E only invited|pg||
nt|ahalim: wow|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: wow, well done|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Padon liked his club control and spots I bet|pg||
nt|petergill: Superficially, South might have passed 5@H, as the partnership might be off @DAK from South's point of view, but he takes the view that his hand could not be better and with no @DA ...|pg||
nt|petergill: nor @DK North would have bid 4@H not 4@C|pg||
nt|ahalim: albeit a little bit undisciplined :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: U26 :)|pg||
nt|othered1: good duck, limiting the loss|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I see|pg||
pc|s5|nt|tomi2: bye|pg||
nt|petergill: In my opinion, slam is not that great a contract, a bit less than 50%, so reaching it is more good luck than good management, perhaps.|pg||
nt|blade: now she will soon claim 9...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=17&qshowflag=1  for running scores in all matches (U26)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: re Michael|pg||
nt|blade: re|pg||
nt|blade: dont know whta happens..why it stopps...|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|MolvaM: gene de 2-3 pik yapýlabildiði için kontrsuz -1 makul sonuç|pg||
nt|pelepele: was 3@s best bid ?|pg||
nt|aupillon: Very VERY dangerous board for France|pg||
nt|mug: so you think he will try to set up a cross-ruff, not try to develop diamonds?|pg||
nt|yuval10: then he knows West has 7-4 and it might help him|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: then @d to the ace will do it for him probably|pg||
nt|yuval10: he knows E has 1 or 2 @h's for not supporting|pg||
nt|yuval10: Israel has won 10 imps on board 3|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW there found the unusual vulnerable sacrifice of 5@h|pg||
nt|mug: East was very bold there to raise partner's second suit at the five-level on Q-x-x|pg||
nt|yuval10: W there opened, as i suggested, 1@s|pg||
nt|mug: much prefer to open the longest suit myself|pg||
nt|blade: operator?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|ahalim: but you were young once too Peter ?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: lol|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: It's not one I would be thrilled to be in, but it's pretty good|pg||
nt|mug: strong five-card suits look very nice until you have to ruff once or twice with them|pg||
nt|lokaty: 2@H was 6+@H almost GF or extremaly well 5card suit.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this was even better when W take the @dQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: mistake by W, with A109x in @d he would have taken the J|pg||
pc|h6|nt|poohbear: as advertised:)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|kastan88: West founs here good @S lead, as @D would give at once 3nT, usually not good to lead from 4TH Jxxx|pg||
nt|MolvaM: þimdi yapara geldi|pg||
nt|eerbil: artýk oldu|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the @C 10 coming down will help his cause|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|mikael_w: now he can even make this kontract depending on def|pg||
nt|hedyg: so E must have 9 @d, he cannot have the 10 or would have played it instead of the J|pg||
nt|mikael_w: good point Hedy|pg||
nt|sundiszno: * -to be :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|laurentiu: not the best lead ... now it will be quiet easy for french pair to fulfill their contract|pg||
nt|MolvaM: evet doðu trefl asý kazanýrken ne döneceðini bilmiyordu|pg||
nt|sybarra: was thinking a same Daniel,  but would worry pard would put me 4 of either of these |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|murat: içerde 4köre geldiler.. imp'ler gözüktü|pg||
nt|ozgull: diðer tarafýn 4c! oynadýðýný düþünürsek bu maç için açýk ara öne geçiyoruz|pg||
nt|eerbil: sonunda ilk IMPlerimizi alacaðýz|pg||
nt|aupillon: no. 3NT with KJx in @c. Otherwise NO more 3NT|pg||
nt|namial1: Well played !|pg||
nt|namial1: same contract no swing|pg||
nt|yuval10: makes it very problematic if it goes like (2@d ) P (3@d )|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hobakan: 1-0 psikolojik skorundan bi kurtulalým:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: what do ou bid then? 3@s ?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: whith a @c lead now he can make 3 NT by squezzing W|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petergill: A long time ago I was as young as Adam, though when I was his age my bridge was terrible, compared to him.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not anymore|pg||
nt|mikael_w: This was a rime when you shod not finess, Q would not lead @s from the Q in his life|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahalim: and the cards are very friendly|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mug: perhaps I can afford to pass if partner's can't raise to 2@H or double 2@D|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hedyg: surely not|pg||
pc|sK|nt|blade: I predict this was 11 or 12 imps for germany...|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|yuval10: but against QXXX @s you have game...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think I would also open 1@s there|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: it's close|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|MolvaM: doðunun trefl asýný boþlamasý defansý çok rahatlatacak idi|pg||
nt|gulyas: then he should not open such a weak hand:) I would probably rebid 1NT then, if no other choice|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|eerbil: kýzlarýmýz bu elde 3körü batýrmýþ|pg||
nt|hedyg: rime=time|pg||

nt|ahollan1: how about if swap @SK with @Cx|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe then.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ: "I had sort of an intermediate jump overcall; I liked the lead; it was on the heart finesse; or a club onside"|pg||
nt|chip: I agree, decent defense and lots of losers.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: 10-15 HCP, (a) 6+@C, 1-suit  (b) 4+@C and 5+@S|pg||
nt|chip: makes 4H unattractive.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lc: Important to know now if X=@D or a good hand. Hope they discussed it.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|poohbear: 4@h with a chance to make in the closed room on 52 ( no @c shift)|pg||
nt|kit: now how does South know whether to choose clubs or spades on his hand?|pg||
nt|lc: West has both cases covered.|pg||
nt|chip: At least he has both.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlike Precision   this 2@D bid does NOT show any values|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Lair sort of alerted the DBL, but no questions|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Pass denies 5+@S hand|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kit: another good example of partnership agreements -- you have to have a general rule on doubles of artificial calls like this, and stick to it|pg||
nt|chip: Ours is it shows the suit, right?|pg||
nt|lc: We play it shows @D.|pg||
nt|kit: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: And now another double, this one takeout|pg||
nt|chip: Showing the suit is my default with Lew also.|pg||
nt|lc: What will Berk do if Lair doubles again?|pg||
nt|kit: And if East passes it, they just might take him out|pg||
nt|kit: well, 5 tricks are easier than 9, so .......|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Lair asks about 2@d. Granovetter won't write because it's now after sundown, so they get up and go away from the table and he explains, not quite loudly enough for me to hear|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: effectively  all hands without significant @C support  bid 2@D|pg||
nt|lc: Pass would get 500, it seems.|pg||
nt|kit: now that seems wrong -- means the other side knows that a bid is alerted and asked about|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ asks Berk if they have an agreement about the DBL of 2@d and he says not clear|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Easier to pass 3@C in a bidding contest than at the table where -670 is painful.|pg||
nt|kit: East's decision a big swing there|pg||
nt|lc: At least that's my defense of my partner.|pg||
nt|kit: simple LAW pass, right Larry?|pg||
nt|lc: You guys can all pile on and say that PASS was easy.  Yeah.|pg||
nt|chip: not a good hand for the NS system. No way for S to avoid playing a silly contract (way too high in 3C, but if he passes 2c, could be a 4-2 with a 5-3 spade fit).|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|kit: You gotta believe!|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lc: Esspecially if partner has @D, pass makes sense.  But David's (and my) philosophy is try not to be -670 and win the match on some other board.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: figure  2 opponents guessing but only 1 partner|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i wish i'd used Kit's philosophy with stock market|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, but -670 not as good as + 140.|pg||
nt|kit: 2 of clubs a very bad idea here|pg||
nt|kit: if it occurs to declarer to stick in the 7, that extra trick might be the difference here.|pg||
nt|kit: playing the 7 of clubs is saying that Ekeblad made a bad play|pg||

nt|kit: declarer probably okay anyway, as he is in overruffing position in both minors|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: but maybe not -- that 2 of spades might be too small to compete with South's spades|pg||
nt|poohbear: Grovesnor is a play where the opponent purposely gives you a winning option when he ddint have to. Strictly to mess with your head|pg||
nt|kit: certainly South needs to ruff -- can't let that 2 of spades score|pg||
nt|poohbear: I am may have the spelling wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter seems to have the little diamond ready to play|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: But he's still thinking about it|pg||

nt|cascade: I prefer to bid my suits on this sort of hand but 2@c would be a common action|pg||

mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: I think so|pg||
nt|kastan88: oh, no|pg||

nt|yuval10: 2@c overcall would've made it a lot easier|pg||
nt|yuval10: if EW doesn't decide to sit for it with X , that is|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Rimstedt could give it a try, but it's not attractive at all from her hand|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps West underbid|pg||

nt|xenya: 9 tricks iseems to be the limit here|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe just 8 on this lead?|pg||
nt|poohbear: best lead. Defense has time to prevent a @d ruff. Declarer can counter by trying to set up a @c but that doesnt work|pg||
nt|sybarra: take a look at bd 3  !   3nt made 6!|pg||
nt|xenya: on a @S lead, yes|pg||
nt|sundiszno: in tennis, you immediately see it |pg||
nt|korszurku: not allowed at the majors I am told|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|petergill: If so, 15 seconds is not considered to be a hesitation - also, with screens, the hesitation exists only if it is pointed out by the opponent on the side of the screen that did not ...|pg||
nt|petergill: hesitate, by EBL (Euro) and WBF regulation. |pg||
nt|petergill: So my guess is that the 6@H score will stand  - just guessing, as a commentator is entitled to do.|pg||

pc|dT|nt|othered1: agree|pg||
nt|sybarra: @H lead was going to be more of a challenge |pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: If the hesitation was over 20 (or is it 25 or 30, I cannot remember) seconds, as it may have been, it is considered to be a valid hesitation with screens in use.|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: denmark is back to tables|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 6@D|pg||
nt|wwalter: @d, but how many? :)|pg||
nt|cascade: it looks too good for you Roland :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It all depends on the response to 1@H. 2@D and you are there, 1@S and it will be difficult|pg||
nt|cascade: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I prefer 2@D (your longer suit) when you are strong enough to force to game, and South is|pg||
nt|cascade: I like almost always to bid my six-card suit with this much strength|pg||
nt|Walddk4: For new viewers: Poland need to win by at least 13 IMPs to overtake France and win the gold medal|pg||
nt|wwalter: & needs 8 VP 4 the second place|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 13-16 imps is a split tie but Poland wins gold|pg||
nt|liviu123: yes after this i agree with you|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: another routine game, although it could be down on a @c lead|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: if declarer is not a rabbi :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps this break is to let the OR to catch up a bit|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: lol|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5 imps for Sweden board 5|pg||
nt|yuval10: 6 rather|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 5 :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: Swedish pair actually made an overtrick in 3@c|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: oh, the board  ... lol|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5 imps in board 6 :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: they are catching up a little now|pg||
nt|yuval10: for those of us who didn't drink their coffee yet :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: that would be me|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10 IMPs to Germany on 7 when the Norwegians came to rest in 3@C|pg||
nt|blade: yes..that was lucky board for germans...the revenge for 7@h down 1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a reasonable slam, can they find it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7@S is actually more than reasonable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@S sorry|pg||
nt|blade: if they discard @s AKQ....then yes|pg||
nt|blade: :)|pg||
nt|blade: @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: and @d return!|pg||
nt|hedyg: he immediately played K@C which was ducked|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sundiszno: all imps going in one way, I'm sad to say|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here its a normal 4 @s, but there is a risk of getting to hi here|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: Hungary's had a tough day today, playing Poland and Israel, the two teams ranked above them|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3D|nt|voldenuit: an easy 4@h |pg||
nt|laurentiu: right ... comme tu dit: l'espoir ne meurs pas jusqu'a la fin|pg||
nt|aupillon: seems no 3T . A shame with all South's points but...|pg||
nt|aupillon: test|pg||
nt|sybarra: sounds like a dessert |pg||
nt|sybarra: *desert|pg||
nt|eggy: He played inthe channel - very impressed by him|pg||
nt|yuval10: and we're back now|pg||
nt|mug: might just open South hand 2NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: how many @h's by W?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1 i guess|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 1 for me|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@h would be 14-16 for you?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sundiszno: but beleive me, this is a good team, just this is a bad day for them|pg||
nt|sundiszno: they played the netherlands previously|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: Oops, my bad, they played The Netherlands, not Israel :)|pg||
nt|korszurku: I think Hungary has delivered very good results so far|pg||
nt|korszurku: unexpected too I would say|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: Yeah, they did well against France yesterday|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Bas, now its up to YOU, You shod ask rhe Hungary players if they REALY dosent need to go ro tha bathroom|pg||
mb|5D|nt|laurentiu: even 6|pg||
nt|sybarra: hope n/s have a majors bid |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@C looks like a "both majors" bid - very bold (youthful?) at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|asig: Are EW on the way to bidding 6@c?|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: OR on previous board NS in 5@SX|pg||
nt|murat: bu arada kýzlarýmýz 3nt'yi +1 yapmýþ.. onlara da aferin yok mu Murat Abi ? :)|pg||
nt|aupillon: no 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|laurentiu: if they play the queen of trump|pg||
nt|aupillon: 2NT is the redid now|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like capp |pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: ok|pg||
nt|kastan88: NS playing 5@S doubled so -1 and 5 IMPs more for Denmark|pg||
nt|aupillon: b*|pg||
nt|vipe1: polish club from east, natural 1@s, can have longer diamonds, 1NT 11-14 |pg||
nt|korszurku: two pairs out of three have had no imternational experience untill now and not even much experience playing tournaments in Hungary|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: I'm not actually at the table Micke :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: 1@H = spades I presume|pg||
nt|mikael_w: why not Dbl on S hand over 3 @c ?|pg||
nt|sundiszno: it wasn't unexpected, I expected good results from them, they worked hard before the EYC, and they are good players|pg||
nt|mikael_w: aha ok Bas :) worth a try|pg||
nt|sundiszno: yes, @s suit lost|pg||
nt|korszurku: looks like all of us are for Hungary now - Mikael too :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|laurentiu: aymeric ... u have to correct me, as long as french is not my mother tongue|pg||
nt|aupillon: 10@h anyone ?|pg||
nt|aupillon: the standard lead|pg||
nt|pelepele: hope a@h|pg||
nt|yo_yo: for those who dont know, eggy means The Channel Trophy|pg||
nt|z_lasu: this match is a good start for Polish juniors who defend European title|pg||
nt|mug: for me 2@H would be a strong bid, yes|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mtvesuvius: I don't think even I would do that :)|pg||
nt|ozgull: bizim gençlere vugraph iyi geliyor sanki  sizler ne dersiniz?|pg||
nt|aupillon: or 9 if you play Kantar|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|eerdvegas: nice after that big loss|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: This will be a big number|pg||

nt|MolvaM: maç bitiminde bir aferin veznesi açýp bord detayýný ibraz eden herkese aferin vereceðim|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu atak ile 1 fazla oldu ama sorun deðil|pg||
nt|aupillon: Do I play 1NT ? ( asked The Rabbi, in David Bird's book)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 4@S a bit of a stretch opposite a single raise |pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d natural and gf|pg||
nt|korszurku: it is natural to sympathize with the team 44 behind...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|MolvaM: 1 imp'yi nelere vermiyoruz|pg||
nt|eerbil: diðer odada deklarasyon bizim için biraz tehlikeli gidiyor bi önceki elde|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: no, I play anything that I can as pre-emptive...|pg||
nt|mug: 1@H is enough|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s minimum and fit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Mr Martens and Mr Holland|pg||
nt|daman: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi George and Krzysz :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: welcome!|pg||
pc|cT|nt|eggy: Of course it was on BBO so I am dissappointed if you didn't watch :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|petergill: When you are playing against top notch players, aggressive vulnerable interference is fraught with danger, because ...|pg||
nt|ahalim: and this is a contract Idid not expect|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyoone understand this auction?|pg||
nt|othered1: west sort of looks like he's making relays.|pg||
nt|sybarra: its the 2 @C bid I do not understand |pg||
nt|othered1: artificial game force?|pg||
nt|gulyas: my thoughts exactly|pg||
nt|peachy: agree, not even a singleton anywhere|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Best defence will yield 500|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's  a shame , the Danes didnt even score on Neilsen's good board, 7|pg||
nt|sybarra: and he played it so well |pg||
nt|sybarra: no rewards sometimes|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry all,  I have a lunch commitment,   must leave |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Any idea why Zimmermann opened 1@C rather than 2@H?|pg||
nt|blade: they play strong @c..no?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with transfer responses? Unusual|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@D and @H?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|eerdvegas: dutch squad haves 50 VP out of 3 matches with a bye(18VP)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|cascade: they got there with 1@s|pg||
nt|cascade: well done|pg||
nt|yuval10: red vs white also, Adam?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: enjoy the rest  and gl all |pg||
nt|mug: South wouldn't have enjoyed putting his hand on he table|pg||
nt|blade: yes..they do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe they do|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|eggy: This could be good for them too as EW can make plenty|pg||
nt|yo_yo: bye |pg||
nt|sybarra: nice of the @H k to be on side |pg||
nt|Walddk2: They will bid it now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: hi George and Krzysztof|pg||
nt|snetram: hi all|pg||
nt|daman: I warn you    I am 100% Irish|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm i would have played @H before @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: oooooops partial then!|pg||
nt|korszurku: and about to be even more with bd 8 yet to be scored|pg||
nt|sundiszno: I'd rather see everyone sympathize with poland than...|pg||
nt|korszurku: :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|eggy: Bye Shirl|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Takes a club switch while hearts are still stopped|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|laurentiu: if we translate my fellow's aymeric nickname this will be - night flight :)|pg||
nt|laurentiu: easy claim for 6 now|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I doubt anyone could have predicted this contract|pg||
nt|petergill: (1) they are not afraid to penalise you (2) they will take their tricks on defence and (3) your interference might help them figure out the layout if they become declarer|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yeah, although I probably should change that :)|pg||
nt|blade: all their system is unusual...but they love it....and opps not.--..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D asking for @SQ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: good start |pg||
nt|othered1: right|pg||
nt|othered1: and this should now make|pg||
nt|othered1: a non-@C return should tell east what he needs to know.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|eggy: difficult for EW to get in though unless west makes a minimum off shape x ...|pg||
nt|eggy: or East comes in at red with S unlimites|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i found a photo of Lhuissier :  http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/07jesolo/Jesolo.htm|pg||

pc|s7|nt|mikael_w: Yes, I am always trying to be natural ( exept when sweden plays) but now I´m realy fealing hungarian :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk3: Down to 300 now|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Provided that declarer guesses clubs|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|blade: nicely bid...now comes the play...|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c2|nt|mtvesuvius: and there are not many ways to win|pg||
nt|petergill: so aggressive vulnerable intervention is a tactic one should (might?) use more often against players who are weaker than you, not against players who are very strong. |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Agreed|pg||
nt|petergill: Adam, are you gong to play in the Washington DC Nationals later this month? |pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is no losing option I think|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: I'll be there the whole time... Being homeschooled is nice :)|pg||

pc|s9|pg||
nt|voldenuit: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ruffing a diamond is till only 11. 6 spades, 3 hearts, 2 diamonds|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I'm glad I don't have to play it|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kastan88: 9 IMPs|pg||
nt|vipe1: tried to make, two down now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|voldenuit: dangerous to play the queen |pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|chip: But then we have to wait till after the hand (usually).|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter didn't realize he was dealer - they explain that no problems just didn't know who was dealer|pg||
mb|d|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|lc: East hand is actually easier to bid in Standard than in big @C.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|kit: most players would play this 3@H bid is looking for a heart stopper, as it is.|pg||
nt|lc: This time, North had better lead his partner's suit to have any chance to beat 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Declarer will then have to guess @S.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Is there any reason we can see that Lair will guess @SQ?  I don't think he will.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kit: well, this time heart lead is pretty easy|pg||
nt|kit: or so I thought|pg||
nt|lc: Strange leade, but will survive.|pg||
nt|chip: A bit different to lead partner's non-space consuming overcall (where the goal is to direct a lead).|pg||
nt|kit: but can survive|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kit: so it comes down to spade guess -- he knows South has longer hearts, so will play king of spades first.  And then ......|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: now Granovetter known to be on minimum overcall - especially for him -- maybe infer singleton @S?|pg||
nt|lc: Would Granovetter overcall with @HKJxxx  @CA and a flat hand VUL?|pg||
nt|lc: I sure would (the way my partner's lead).|pg||
nt|lc: But Granovetter is indeed sound.|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe for that reason, Ekeblad should not have revealed the @CJ here.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Lair checked the clock - we have plenty of time, so he's taking a restroom break and Russ is smoking. Back soon|pg||
nt|lc: Is BBO available in the restroom?|pg||
nt|lc: :)|pg||
nt|lc: Players are not allowed to have any electronic decives, by the way.|pg||
nt|lc: A good rule in today's electronic age.|pg||
nt|chip: maybe if you have an iphone or equivalent (why security on those is tight)|pg||
nt|lc: They actually don't screen or check.  It is on the "honor system."|pg||
nt|chip: But harsh penalties if caught.|pg||
nt|lc: Players wouldn't intentionally have a device, but they often forget to unload them and accidentally walk in with one in pocket.|pg||
nt|lc: Several times, cell phones have gone off and caused big problems.|pg||
nt|lc: Not at this event, as far as I know.|pg||
nt|poohbear: somebody mentioned a cell phone going off|pg||
nt|poohbear: forget who|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can Lair afford to win, and play some @D to get better inferential count?|pg||
nt|kit: not too safely|pg||
nt|lc: I don't think so, since North could ruff a @D|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe opponents would give honest count in @D.  :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lc: Maybe.|pg||
nt|kit: and he still won't know about the clubs -- that jack of clubs doesn't have to be remotely honest|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c2|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|lc: As North, you don't like to see that @SK.|pg||
nt|kit: and here we are ladies and gentlemen|pg||
nt|poohbear: Jack of @cs sure looked like someone who wanted to tap dummy|pg||
nt|kit: jack of clubs meaningless -- unless somebody has 4 spades, dummy tap is meaningless|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Schwartz in similar position but  2 rounds of hearts, Passell overtakes cashes @CA and exits @D|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: does @C5 lead then @CJ help decide if they're  34 vs 43 ??|pg||

nt|sundiszno: well, not 2 imps for us|pg||
nt|mikael_w: omg|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petergill: When you feel down, it is hard to avoid giving back more imps. |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H is a sound contract, should make it and go plus, we hope|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@H is a nice spot, maybe an overtrick with the @h position|pg||
nt|petergill: I approve of both Wests deciding not to make a bold vulnerable 2@H overcall of 1@S. |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Craciun tells me that the Director has adjusted board 7|pg||
nt|aupillon: Have a nice day all, see you soon. Tks Charles and be right back tomorrow. Thanks all specs. Merci|pg||
nt|eggy: so this is a 4 card raise with 10+|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Robert has to pass, no interest by East|pg||
nt|eggy: Not sure that after 5@H this i even a think|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Glorious sunshine in Bath|pg||
nt|z_lasu: 3NT could be made here|pg||
nt|sybarra: Poland needs to "right the ship"  |pg||
nt|daman: do*|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mtvesuvius: to 5@h +1|pg||
nt|po-s: wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: only 8 tricks in NT, and 10 in clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: wait a minute, @DQ drops|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So 3NT is there|pg||
pc|sT|nt|eggy: after all East is limited to 3 cards in hearts, so setting up the diamond suit may not even be that straightforward|pg||
nt|cascade: hmmm cold and frosty here|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 1@s shows 3?|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No wonder you can't make Wuermseer co-operate|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|petergill: In the other match on BBO, Owen for England and Ozturk both overcalled 2@H over 1@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah well Neilsen might lead A@S|pg||
nt|vipe1: i guess 2@c is gazzili, either weak hand with 5@h4@c or a strong hand|pg||
nt|othered1: 25 HCP, no major fit = 3N.  May make, too.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: ok, and this should make exactly|pg||
nt|xenya: meanwhile the Israeli team have built up a commanding lead, having outdone their oponents on almost every board|pg||
nt|daman: low @D gives the opps timing|pg||
nt|snetram: more then 70% players lead club - in my opinion|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|MolvaM: 2@c deklaresi genellikle 6lý trefl veya 5li ise yanda bir majör oynanýyor|pg||
nt|murat: kýzlarýmýz detaylarý için http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/BoarddetailsCondit.asp?qmatchid=25206|pg||
nt|cascade: France should win some back here|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Well, North might lead a club|pg||
nt|wwalter: 11 Imps , back 4 france|pg||
pc|h8|nt|MolvaM: normalde batmasý gereken bir kontrat bu|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a lead directing double |pg||
nt|Walddk4: and back in the lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: might just hand it |pg||
nt|hedyg: N assumes as well|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mtvesuvius: oh, @c ruff for -1|pg||
nt|sundiszno: could have been|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|eggy: As Julien Clement says - 4S was possibly exclusion ..|pg||
nt|eggy: so a spade lead would not be sensible|pg||
nt|eggy: and S has told N to lead something alse anyway|pg||
nt|vipe1: this now shows strong hand with 3@s, nekrasova simply raises to 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @D, 3 @C, (maybe) 1 in each major |pg||
nt|gulyas: if he tries to play it safe by finessing @Ds into the S hand to avoid the @S thru, he may go down|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petergill: entries to dummy for @H finesses and to run diamonds are scarce, if @DA is ducked on the first round of @Ds|pg||
nt|petergill: Clubs get overruffed|pg||
nt|hobakan: 10 lu kör þanssýz bizim için:(|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well done the Danes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: go on, who is J C?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Overall in  the event that is|pg||
nt|namial1: oups|pg||
nt|cascade: it might be more - I am told that 2@H actually made in the other room and it has been misscored|pg||
nt|chessmaste: But it had to be at trick one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Netherlands hot favourites to win the bronze medal, but Denmark has an outside chance|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hobakan: körler kamufle oldu sistemden dolayý|pg||
pc|cA|nt|othered1: Not sure an early @D play is right, unless needed for entries|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Krzysz, wouldn't you?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: now dec soon has a chanse of setting a @d up|pg||
nt|daman: I would|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|eggy: Although his hand is very tempting, I think that West took control too early really|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if it was exclusion then Lhussier didnt know either|pg||
nt|eggy: well the club is not going to run, so probably a trump is best technically now|pg||
nt|eggy: that's true Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you were right steve, the Danes gained on the last board|pg||
nt|eggy: yep - fearless intervention in the sandwich position|pg||
nt|z_lasu: but not that way|pg||
nt|mug: I prefer to play 1@S is just waiting, and 1NT is strong balanced|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 2@h should make here, I think|pg||
pc|c2|nt|MolvaM: pik oynama zamaný geldi|pg||

nt|vipe1: interesting play problem now, let's see how nekrasova tackles it|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ozgull: batý marka saklamadý ama çözülebilir|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our girls had 26 VPs after day 1 (3 matches) and were 2nd to last, so we are pretty pleased with the result no matter what|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petergill: Good duck - NS play upside down count|pg||
pc|hA|nt|MolvaM: aferin irfan|pg||
nt|eerbil: bence Rua pik daha iyiydi|pg||

nt|mikael_w: ond now dec is home safe|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: but with that switch...|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|MolvaM: e teknik analiz yapýcam dedin de yapma mý dedik|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They scored a maximum 75 VPs on day 2|pg||

pc|h7|nt|asig: The @c fit was lost in the bidding|pg||
nt|MolvaM: evet korkulan oldu|pg||
nt|hobakan: malesef:(|pg||
nt|MolvaM: irfan ortaðýn pik damýný yemeyeyim dedi, muhammet ise demek pik ruasý yokmuþ ki oynamadý dedi|pg||
nt|ozgull: neyse belki 4h yaparlar|pg||
nt|MolvaM: polyanna hoþgeldin :)|pg||

nt|murat: trefi döndüler.. batacak|pg||
nt|hobakan: ara verildi heralde|pg||
nt|MolvaM: güneyde diyelim ki pik dam 2 parça olsa bile|pg||
pc|h9|nt|petergill: A desperate attempt to remove the entry to the @Ds|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: It needed the Q@s return|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: tough to know that though|pg||
nt|sundiszno: i am a little bit hopeless|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
pc|sA|nt|mtvesuvius: K@C to kill the @d entry looked right|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|sybarra: your prediction Daniel |pg||
nt|sundiszno: sorry for that|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kastan88: 6@C quite problematic witn @H lead: if you collect trumps, then you have only 4@H+4@C+1@S+1@D+1 ruff= 11 tricks, if play at once for @D A finesse, then def will get @H ruff|pg||
nt|daman: I think he was always going to get his 7 tricks before the got theirs|pg||
nt|daman: they*|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sundiszno: but still this is a good team, and they will recover from here, for the next match|pg||
pc|sK|nt|poohbear: I srael has been the hottest team the last few matches|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|xenya: and this may well be another pickup for them|pg||
nt|poohbear: They haved moved from 16th to 5th at the start of this one and may have moved past Italy. Sweden is beating the second place Germans on the other Vugraph|pg||
nt|xenya: what's the score there now, Barry?|pg||
nt|poohbear: For running scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Results.htm click on juniors|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks|pg||

nt|poohbear: Sweden|pg||
nt|lokaty: in the schools event there is also Poland vs Israel match:)|pg||
nt|lokaty: right now 7:2 for Israel|pg||
nt|poohbear: Israel has past Norway and is in third place |pg||
pc|s6|mc|9|nt|laurentiu: he has chosen a good line|pg||
nt|z_lasu: should duck first club and then play @h|pg||

nt|lc: Some famous experts of yesteryear were great at reading the people (Poker-type skills) to "always" sniff out these queens.|pg||
nt|lc: Actually, Schwartz (at other table) claims to be very good at this aspect.|pg||
nt|lc: He has a good nose for these things and picking up "tells."|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ mumbling about trying to show him the J of clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: of course  North on other side of screen from declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: But, South can have a "tell" too.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|lc: Schwartz recently guessed a queen against DB-and-me -- claiming he could "tell."|pg||

nt|poohbear: Hold your cards back Larry|pg||

nt|MolvaM: bence Muhammet'in küçük pik oynamasý daha anlaþýlabilir bir oyun tarzý|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The big difference on this deal was that East did not bid in the Open Room|pg||
nt|wwalter: this was strange|pg||
nt|cascade: hmmm what happened there|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Did she really go down?|pg||
nt|wwalter: ADI?|pg||
nt|cascade: didnt seem possible|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: looked like declarer made a mistake and went down|pg||
nt|namial1: what happened ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Perhaps the play was different from what we saw|pg||
nt|namial1: clubs ruff ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sometimes it's very difficult for the operator to follow the play|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: im in rama room entering exactly what i see, so i dont know more than you|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So we must give him the benefit of the doubt|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: but final scores are right|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, excellent|pg||
nt|snetram: they need 3 tempo, no way|pg||
nt|daman: no   but that didn't happen|pg||
nt|hedyg: Ireland got on the bd on bd 8|pg||
nt|mikael_w: it was not to late after the @s lead|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT or 4@H on this one?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: We had a few of those yesterday in Cardiff|pg||
mb|1S|nt|laurentiu: 2 spades shows 5Mc and at least 4mc|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT|pg||
nt|snetram: standard 3NT|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk3: Should Drijver have known to switch to a diamond rather than a club? Not sure. Michielsen just encouraged, which was not helpful|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yo_yo: see you later folks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: bye for now|pg||
nt|gulyas: NS can make 6@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 @C  or 6 nt?|pg||
nt|gulyas: it is hard to bid the @SJ:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: a spec suggests 7 @S |pg||
nt|gulyas: nice idea|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I will be there |pg||
nt|Walddk3: Looks like he took the 5 as a suit preference signal for clubs|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|laurentiu: a good defence against 5 hearts|pg||
nt|eggy: Values are a bit thin, but 4C looks tempting for West|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Due to the lucky position of @DQ, 5@C also makes. The Swedes bid and made it against Bulgaria|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztt: Back, the players took a small break and so did I, but they were back faster :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ovncylmz: 5@d and 3nt making|pg||
nt|eggy: He's done well|pg||
nt|eggy: so far |pg||

pc|s7|nt|ovncylmz: hmm|pg||

nt|Walddk4: I don't think Wayne supports England, but he must be happy to see that Australia did not win|pg||
nt|cascade: lol|pg||
nt|cascade: they should have declared earlier|pg||
nt|mug: quite natural methods the Israeli NS play|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@s looks weird|pg||
nt|mug: for many juniors 2@D would be part of Drury|pg||

nt|murat: as soruldu|pg||
nt|mug: agreed, North should pass|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: right, it may have been a misunderstanding even|pg||
nt|hedyg: W would need a stronger hand to bid 3@c, thus 2@H=5+|pg||
pc|s2|nt|eggy: the problem with bidding 3H 1st time though , is that he's got a problem biding now|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The youngsters like to bid. One can argue with that is a 2@H overcall after a strong NT|pg||
nt|Walddk3: *if|pg||
nt|daman: @S lead is not useful|pg||
nt|daman: any lead is ugly|pg||
nt|hedyg: i wonder though, with his primes isnt the E hand more suitable for 4@H?|pg||
nt|daman: except a @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: @D lead is excluded from the bidding|pg||
nt|snetram: 12 tricks without play|pg||
nt|daman: no kidding|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: this isnt good for Norway  imo |pg||
nt|gulyas: you need to relay somebody's hand out to be able to get there|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 nt looked quantitative |pg||
pc|c4|nt|MolvaM: bu arada önceki elde büyü yaparak, dua ederek, reiki yaparak veya diðer bilimsel yollarla 4@hün yapýlmasýný saðlayan seyircilerimize de teþekkür|pg||
nt|vipe1: seems like a normal 4@s. interesting how some pairs ended in 3NT, sadly we don't have auction from other room|pg||
nt|vipe1: some=two :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: Website for this event is http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Brasov.htm|pg||

nt|petergill: Results at http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Results.htm|pg||
nt|eggy: N is wishing he'd kept his outh shut now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT is, in theory, 15-17, but ....|pg||
pc|cT|nt|asig: good stop by EW here|pg||
nt|othered1: Not unusual for quantitative bidding to come a cropper here.  If north had gotten the long suit into the auction, south would have been very interested|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Rimstedt had her bid and will be disappointed that this is not making|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Norway did not bid slam on 9|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gulyas: but if S has a minimum, N should have bid slam already|pg||
nt|gulyas: agree, he should have brought @Cs to the picture|pg||
nt|gulyas: into I mean|pg||
nt|othered1: Do we know what range south showed here?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not how to bring the clubs in do you guys have suggestions?|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd consider south's hand 22+, and I'm not a habitual upgrader|pg||
nt|othered1: Hand is good enough for four NT, so transfer to @C, if available, then 4N.|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would say it is a very pretty 22|pg||
nt|gulyas: if his bidding shows 22+, N should have bid slam with his good 10|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N openings (directly or via 2@C) require very precise methods/agreements to unwind hands like this.|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe 3 @C over 2 @C?|pg||
nt|othered1: They do hog quite a bit of room and today's style doesn't require perfect shape, so . . . |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|eggy: and so ends up taking a losing action|pg||
nt|Walddk3: unless ....|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Michielsen has to guess who has @SJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was easy to make 12 tricks after West tried a second club honour. But remember that he was trying to beat 5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ozgull: þehmus ile güney dünkü maçýda çok baþarýlý oynadýlar|pg||
nt|eggy: One principle of pushing is that you are making the opponents guess|pg||
nt|yuval10: many players here play 2@d as 9-11 with 3 cards support|pg||
nt|yuval10: but i never though NS are one of them|pg||
pc|h4|nt|MolvaM: bu elde sorun yok. 7 trefl bekliyoruz :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And he did not know about the singleton in the South hand as South was declarer|pg||
nt|blade: needs exact defence now...tough...|pg||
nt|blade: @hAK...@sA and @s...dont think he can find that?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yuval10: appearently neither did S :)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: well done|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|eggy: so that when they do, you shouldn;t usually end up taking a guess yourself|pg||
nt|hedyg: test the @hs and play A@C and 10@c|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|eggy: of course N was,'t expecting such good defence in the S hand|pg||

nt|cascade: even with the five-card suit|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Vugraphztt: !!!|pg||

pc|d7|nt|vipe1: board over and russia extends the lead|pg||
nt|vipe1: i wonder if nekrasova will take last trick with @d7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vipe1: probably that's why there was delay :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|snetram: but i am not agree with 3NT, If W has 6 H, better contact will be 4H, then 3NT, you have to check it. |pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|lc: I suspect 3@D is a minimum and 3@H asks again.|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Berkowitz has written very neat, VERY TINY notes about this auction - even with my brand new glasses there is no chance I can read them, sorry|pg||
nt|chip: or perhaps a stiff club (low stiff?)|pg||
nt|lc: If it shows any short, presumably 3NT now by Lair to ask where.|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|lc: Jan, did you use "neat" and "Berkowitz" in the same sentence?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Vugraphu1: Yes and "tiny"|pg||
nt|lc: :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|chip: note that while slam is virtually laydownhere, if E were 6-3-3-1 it would be quite poor.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|lc: Indeed.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even with computer -- my notes aren't neat|pg||
nt|chip: So W was a bit lucky to find partner with the right hand.|pg||
nt|lc: So, 3@S did show specifically @C shortness.  I guess Lair wasn't worried about being off @HAK.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Berk says that 3@d showed a minimum and 3@h asked and 3@s showed club shortness. Lair thought that 3@s showed balance with a little extra|pg||
nt|lc: Also, when no X of Artif 3@H, a @H lead is less likely.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: And now that I have looked at Berk's notes, I will admit that "neat" might have been a slight overbid, but 'tiny' wasn't|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lc: You told us "VERY NEAT" -- I have it in writing.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Lair: "good luck" Berk: "this will not require luck, it will require not making 7, which I'd rather not"|pg||

nt|sundiszno: weak NThere|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 11-14...now actually 10|pg||
nt|mikael_w: partscore here, 3 @s vs 3 @d, But even 4 @d is posible whith the asumed @s lead|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and 3 @s is far away from easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: I doubt the auction will be similar in the open room - for a start, I'd be very surprised should S open 3@C|pg||
nt|vipe1: misfit board, interesting to see where they stop|pg||
nt|vipe1: nice result in open room for poland, most pairs play 3@c|pg||
nt|snetram: 6331 with short in clubs - very bad|pg||
nt|mikael_w: big risk that N/S will come ro 4 @h here and its ded|pg||
nt|hedyg: E could have "invented" 2@s or 3@c as forcing over 2@H, i think that was his only choice|pg||
nt|korszurku: 1NT is either a miscklick or they have lowered their NT level :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eerbil: sistemleri sonucu karo kaybolmuþ durumda ama|pg||
nt|korszurku: maybe a semi-psyche|pg||
pc|dA|nt|blade: another slam....but...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not particularly interesting when all of a sudden we just have a claim. They can't have played it that fast|pg||
nt|blade: 2@d from S?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not blaming the operator. He is just copying what he sees on a big screen|pg||
nt|blade: why nit 2@h?|pg||
nt|blade: not|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Lol. This was far from what I predicted|pg||
nt|mikael_w: so 4 down now|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: Some people would've bid 2@C with the E hand, you guys?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|MolvaM: evet skor daha sempatik oldu.|pg||

nt|sundiszno: and what to bid over 2@d?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 6@c isn't a bad spot|pg||
nt|gulyas: with me being converted to strong @C recently, I am very happy with my system when I see these hands:)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mtvesuvius: but the @hs are troublesome|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 11: The Israeli interference at the other table helped guide the Belgians to the good 3NT|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Woops|pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I agree whith W here that his hand is even worth a 15-17 NT. But this rime he stoped N/S to reach imposible 4 @h|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|laurentiu: it seems that will be 3 down |pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: ly 3 diam!|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: only!!!|pg||
nt|z_lasu: Romanian pair playing 3nt at board 9|pg||
nt|z_lasu: only one pair have won it already, but unfortunately they partners played 3d X -7 :)|pg||
nt|mug: you'd think over the double East would have sufficient opportunity to express pessimism that West wouldn't have to reraise|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: depends if pass or 2@s is stronger over the double though|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, E has XX, 2@h , P available|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: but I agree with a 4333 minimum that east has a pass|pg||
nt|mug: so perhaps 2@H should be natural, pass should be so-so, and 2@S should be garbage|pg||
nt|mug: I've never discussed the meaning of redouble|pg||
nt|blade: oh....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
pc|d3|nt|eggy: N will need to duck the club smothly to have  chance|pg||

nt|Walddk2: juniors|pg||
nt|blade: no its interesting|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this time *|pg||
nt|hedyg: what about possible 5@C? needs a @c lead to beat it?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: everybody psykes at the same board now :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|MolvaM: yani sorun yoktur|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vipe1: seems it makes on this lay of cards, quite lucky i'd say :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|namial1: Difficult lead|pg||
nt|chris3108: goooooooooo france :) |pg||
nt|chessmaste: Still, declarer is still a trick short|pg||
nt|cascade: but the defense need to get their spade tricks|pg||
nt|chris3108: euh sorry :) |pg||
nt|cascade: and they need to do that now|pg||
nt|wwalter: now needs to play 1s|pg||
nt|chessmaste: But I think North must now play spades |pg||
nt|cascade: she may think a diamond is safe|pg||
nt|chessmaste: She has a count in the diamond suit|pg||
nt|korszurku: I am suprised to see N pass over the weak NT however|pg||
nt|sundiszno: a kib said 2@h, and maybe play in 4-2...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I am MORE suprised ro see N turn a LOW @d after rhe A|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ovncylmz: back*|pg||
nt|eggy: well done|pg||
nt|blade: X from W?...in the moment I cannot follow...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why on earth does Johansen think he can best 4@H??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: beat|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think 5 @c will be ealy hard to make whith any lead ?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|eggy: that won;t help the defence though|pg||
pc|s9|nt|othered1: All one or two spec who may have read Precision Power Bidding (not about Precision @C  system, which was developed much later) have heard about the Theory of Bounded Values, which ...|pg||
nt|othered1: applies here.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: exept maybe @d|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 3NT could be "serious". I don't know the E-W methods|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Maybe PO Sundelin does|pg||
nt|blade: for a @d lead?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tomi2: 4@D was blackwood for @D and 5@C was 2 keycards and @DQ|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: what about israel performance?|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: denmark and israel are not good if you think their original level|pg||
nt|eggy: although he may try a ruffing finesse in clubs|pg||
nt|cascade: now attitude in spades|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Well done indeed!|pg||
nt|sybarra: here a make |pg||
nt|poohbear: On a @h lead best for West to play the Q and declarer has to guess what to do|pg||
nt|lokaty: would have to guess after @H lead and putting the queen|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok the question is: do you all pass 2@c as S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: pd bid 2@c nat vulnerable|pg||
nt|snetram: no, i bid 2H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cascade: well done|pg||
nt|Walddk3: They are very ambitious at the other table I am told. Verbeek-Molenaard are in 7@H!|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Molenaar|pg||
nt|poohbear: Defense can counter with a @c shif tthough|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we are claiming |pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@s was the spot|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, a @H lead beats 3N|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: Natural bidding up to and including 4@C, 3@D suggesting 1435 shape, I think|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This should be a push|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: With no way to set @s up, and @h overruffs|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@d and 4@S look like cue-bids, with clubs agreed. |pg||
nt|po-s: don´t think they play serious. 2spades showed heart acceptance I think (if they play my NT methods)|pg||
nt|po-s: 3NT I believe would have denied shortness|pg||
nt|sybarra: doesnt N just have to hold up the @H to make 3 nt? |pg||
nt|sundiszno: if partner has @ds 2@c will turn out to be bad|pg||
nt|korszurku: this could be a pickup if N-S get to 3NT|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|petergill: South's final choice of 6@C is a bit exuberant, but would be fine if dummy had @CJ or @DQ. |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: or Q@S|pg||
nt|petergill: 12 tricks if only he could get to dummy to enjoy the spade tricks - somehow. But he cannot|pg||
nt|ahalim: still too optimistic|pg||
nt|wwalter: nice|pg||
nt|namial1: good switch|pg||
nt|cascade: so more IMPs to Poland|pg||
nt|vipe1: didn't let her gues how to play it, A@s AK@h A@d and five clubs.|pg||
nt|vipe1: *guess|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tomi2: they have played 3 of 23 matches...|pg||
nt|eggy: great result for teh Danes in the open|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes, but even then he only has 3 tricks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|blade: he/she gets what he/she derserves for that X..I am sorry...|pg||

pc|c6|nt|vipe1: she hid the longest suit :)|pg||
nt|blade: ok|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lars Arthur Johansen|pg||
nt|mikael_w: :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petergill: Ah, the optimism of youth :)|pg||
nt|blade: so..then it was necessary to bid the slam...|pg||
nt|blade: not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well, that would also have been doubled, and redoubled :)|pg||
nt|blade: and costs then?|pg||
nt|blade: dont know this score---|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2070|pg||
nt|blade: ok|pg||
nt|sundiszno: partner played the Q, if that is singleton, declarer has stoppers anyway|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|po-s: I think West should have bid slam with 3 and not 0 aces|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hobakan: valla +1 bize uyar|pg||
nt|z_lasu: +2 looks too much|pg||
nt|z_lasu: something must go wrong in defence|pg||
nt|Walddk3: You can make 7 with open cards|pg||
nt|hedyg: me too|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hobakan: undo|pg||
nt|ozgull: mu acaba?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: herhalde|pg||
nt|eerbil: niye? +1 yapsak fena mý olur|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Yes, I think 5@H was meant as "pass with 0, bid on with 3 keycards"|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hobakan: ama butür durumlarda siyah rualar karýþýr|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|petergill: I'm off to bed - it's been fun commentating. Goodnight Adam and Arifin.|pg||
nt|othered1: No bid can be permitted q littitude of count or distribution so great that there no longer remains a sufficient number of bidding levels to complete the definition of the hand.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mikael_w: yes, but this time partner played J|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vipe1: interesting that she didn't try to take more tricks by ducking the diamond and seeing what develops|pg||
pc|c9|nt|wwalter: deserved 7 IMPS|pg||
nt|cascade: 220 for 6 i think|pg||
nt|wwalter: only , 6, was in green|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Also some applause for E/W in the bidding|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|lc: All of Lair's @H plays trying to show lowest side suit (S.P.)|pg||
nt|lc: A big difference in the "expert" game is the constant use of subtle S.P. cards on defense.|pg||
nt|lc: Of course, your partner has to be watching.|pg||
nt|chip: Though some are more worried about helping declarer.|pg||
nt|lc: I remember the late great Bobby Goldman once told me that he is an excellent signaller but not as good a receiver.,|pg||
nt|lc: My philosophy is to always try to help partner, who is likely to need it more.  If declarer benefits, so be it.|pg||
nt|lc: I know my partner (if David) is watching. Never sure if declarer is.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: board 57 about to be pushed at 6@S|pg||
nt|mittmouse: to get out for 2 down he has to win the h and play a h back|pg||
nt|chip: A good declarer usually is watching.|pg||
nt|lc: I know you;d be watching, Chip :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Lisa Berkowitz had been turning the dummy for Russ, he just came back and as he sat down, he started to pick up her Sudoku book, but she took it - maybe he doesn't have enough to ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: occupy himself with remembering their system :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ couldn't stand it, got up to go out for another puff and Lisa's back turning the dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: identical auction in other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: If a card is ever called that is|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2NT in the closed room|pg||
nt|lc: It takes mental discipline to fight hard as declarer when you know it is a matter of -200 or -300.  But, in a close match, this is so importnat now.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sorry, he had the A out but put it back|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lc: Also, there is a (bad) tendancy (habit) in a close, tense, important match such as this, to play quickly on the last board or two to run out and find out the result.|pg||

nt|othered1: People who Michaels on south 's hand (I don't) will find @C here.  More often, however, they can lose the unspecified minor.|pg||
nt|sybarra: too good for michaels for you?|pg||
nt|othered1: At matchpoints there's a case for bidding 2@C on the south hand, with a hep (and tolerant) partner|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would rather Michaels with it, considering the suit quality in @Hs|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am a michaels bidder |pg||
nt|othered1: Yes, too good for me, as I play it preemptive |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I play michaels as very good or bad|pg||
nt|othered1: this seems neither very good or very bad, unless  you downgrade because of crumby @H suit.|pg||
nt|sybarra: the @H is almost like a 4 @C suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: *like a 4 card suit |pg||
nt|othered1: Playing with my preferred partners, 2@S is an ASTRO cue, showing 4@H and 6@C.  I might try that here due to relative suit qualilty|pg||
nt|gulyas: wow, I always admired ppl who tried those conventions:)|pg||
nt|othered1: Been playing that over 40 years|pg||

nt|eggy: Seems unlikely|pg||

mb|p|nt|kastan88: 3@H= 10...12 3-card support|pg||

mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Brave bidding by West|pg||
nt|cascade: i am told it is conventional showing three hearts|pg||
nt|cascade: i like 2@s with a fit|pg||
nt|vipe1: interesting thing in russian team is that volozhenin plays almost all the boards but swaps the partner|pg||
nt|sybarra: S wishing he had used Michaels |pg||

nt|sundiszno: if they lead one, yes|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk3: Last 6 boards (after the accident on board 7): 45 IMPs to Sweden|pg||
nt|Walddk3: For new viewers. There was a revoke on board 7, so a doomed 4@H vulnerable made after all when one trick was transferred to the non-offending side|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mikael_w: Old Blackwood will take away any chanse for Grand here and 6 @s will end the bidding|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chessmaste: In theory this should go down|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|hedyg: how can W bid 4NT with Jxx in @H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think he should bid 4@s and let his pd take over if he can|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahalim: there goes our overtrick :)|pg||
nt|vipe1: would be interesting to know how they pick which partnerships play a match :).|pg||

nt|vipe1: quite lucky that spades are split, but still goes down on non-spade lead|pg||
nt|sundiszno: you were right|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hedyg: 4@s over 4@d would show a problem in @H|pg||

nt|mikael_w: But Krysztof, you must remember that there is alot of hands your P know you DON´T have when you bid slower if you play rhis 2 NT conv.|pg||

nt|snetram: 1S2C2D2S3H - showing 5341|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and if you dont bid 2 NT your P knows you have denied 12+ and support|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yep, I always say that dont try to take something back, You never know what happend at thee other table. BUT they are so much behind now so a tough game is not the hole world :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The 4@HXX+2 not scored yet. That will likely take Germany to the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is this an upgraded 15-17?|pg||
nt|blade: they üplay 1C strong..dont think their NT is 15-17....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=xxx+A10+Axx+AQ10xx  15.85|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so *if* you play a strong NT, you should upgrade according to Kaplan and Rubens|pg||
nt|Walddk2: are we here, operator?|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: yes, nothing happening|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: dunno if theres a technical prob or just a break|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Norway did bid slam on board 12. It wasn't doubled, and Germany gained 9 IMPs|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ovncylmz: interesting hand|pg||
nt|eggy: now 22-8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh, maybe they can|pg||
nt|yuval10: was essential for E to play Q@c then|pg||
mb|p|nt|laurentiu: I began to lost my hope ... :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i guess we cant argue with success but i am not happy with that bidding|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vipe1: spec noticed 3@d makes too, could prove to be interesting bidding challenge :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: over the T|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ovncylmz: i predict a 3-4level competition ll be coming|pg||
nt|vipe1: well bid by nekrasova|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|kastan88: 11th brd Open room West bid 6@D. Who can blame North cashing her @CA against slam? ... 11 IMPs more too Denmark|pg||

nt|hedyg: with a good view in @c|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ovncylmz: 3@h now?|pg||
nt|mug: might have helped|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: slam time here|pg||
nt|snetram: 2NT - because i have good 5 cards suit, partner has only 11PC, and you can win 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat: :) ööö meraba !|pg||
nt|murat: karodan hiç haberleri yok|pg||

nt|yuval10: and now a missed slam|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: or not|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk4: Time is running out for the French girls. To be fair, Poland has been the better team in this match|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|laurentiu: I suppose 2nt shows both majors ... and 4diamonds is transfer for spades|pg||
nt|laurentiu: not an easy contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: why duck the @H lead?|pg||
mb|p|pc|d3|nt|murat: 1NT'nin 5+ pik ve 8+ puan olduðunu düþünüyoruz :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 7 karo kör veya nt olabiliyor. bakalým becerebilecekler mi|pg||
nt|yuval10: things are really getting downhill for Sweden|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mtvesuvius: if 2NT is what I think it is, I cannot believe east didn't go looking|pg||
nt|Walddk3: No way to beat this when diamonds come in. Just 1 overtrick though|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mug: East must have missorted his cards|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|MolvaM: aslýnda kozu karo olarak bulabilselerdi koz dam olmadýðý için 7ye gitmekten çekinebilirlerdi|pg||
nt|eerbil: bu gidiþle 7 demeleri çok zor görünüyor|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ama sanýrým þimdi karanlýkta el yordamý ile 7@he gidebilirler|pg||
nt|namial1: 10 Tricks i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: or was the ghestem?|pg||
nt|sybarra: wasnt ghestem as I know it |pg||
nt|xenya: just set up the long @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: and all ok after that |pg||
pc|h2|nt|MolvaM: aynen dünki ingiltere maçýndaki durum bence|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @D, 1 @H, 2 @S and 2 @C |pg||
nt|xenya: you can even make an overtrick that way |pg||
nt|xenya: by endplaying E|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Vlad,  uptrick available but may not go for ir |pg||
nt|sybarra: *it|pg||
nt|xenya: what's happening?|pg||
nt|snetram: rutine play|pg||
nt|sundiszno: the @c slam depending on @hs, @hA (or J) must be with south, and @hs must be 3-3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|laurentiu: unless NS pair will make big mistakes|pg||
nt|laurentiu: Robert has to think seriously at the odds |pg||
nt|MolvaM: 1@c açýþý herþeyin ilacý diye düþünülüyor ama sonrasý pek çalýþýlmadýðý için sorun çýkabiliyor|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sorun çýkmasýna itirazým olduðundan deðil tabii :)|pg||
nt|eerbil: kaptanlýðý Doðu alsa ve ortaðýnýn daðýlýmýný öðrense, en sonunda karo damýný da öðrenip en iyi kontratý tespit edebilir|pg||
nt|gulyas: ghestem eschews the 3@C natural bid, and thereby lets you show both suits at once|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|eerbil: bence bizimkiler normal bir 6@d oynayacaklar bu eli |pg||
nt|MolvaM: eh bu iyi. bu borddan kaybýmýz olmaz. veya en çok 2 imp veririz 6 karoda kalýrlarsa açýk odadakiler|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|hedyg: routine is not always right, W could have switched and he never makes the @H trick|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: but ghestem would have been 2 @H bid right?|pg||
nt|gulyas: in ghestem, the cue bids the 2 extreme suits (ie @Ss and @Cs), and 3@C shows the 2 other suits remaining|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder how wide a range west's bid showed on last hand.  We're getting lots of anti-Michaels hands here.|pg||
nt|gulyas: over 1@C, 2@D is the Ms, and 3@C shows the extremes|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kastan88: now here interesting hand, i would reopen 3@D this East hand, but may be she hoped partner can pass for penalty|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: good day folks|pg||

nt|yuval10: they don't play 2NT normal, i think|pg||

pc|d7|nt|kastan88: not easy to play this 4-3 fit only, would South play 3rd time clubs, could be worse for declarer|pg||
nt|MolvaM: deklaran 15 löve almaya oynuyor. iyi fikir olabilir|pg||
pc|s4|nt|laurentiu: I lost conn for some couple of moments|pg||

nt|vugraphztt: .|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: we have 5 more boards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's quite funny to notice that West thought he had a double of FOUR in this room; the other West did not double SIX! Judge for yourself|pg||

mb|1D|nt|gulyas: so it kills yet another good defensive bid, the 2@D over 1@C opening|pg||
nt|mug: Israel on top, getting into blitz territory|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I do not suggest that kind of treatment:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: specs suggest that 3NT was slam inv. with support|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mtvesuvius: hmm, it's possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: club partial EW, and unlikely to get past 3 level|pg||
nt|eggy: Thanks to other results, France have stretched a 5 VP lead at the top now|pg||
nt|sundiszno: inverted raise|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kastan88: 4@S EW line, probably South fighting here|pg||
nt|kastan88: that may be stop EW in partscore?|pg||
nt|cascade: yes it is one IMP|pg||
nt|namial1: why 170 instead of 200 ?|pg||
nt|cascade: the endplay was unavoidable if the last three cards were accurate|pg||
nt|namial1: Poor dummy|pg||
nt|cascade: but well bid by south|pg||
nt|Walddk4: According to the K&R Hand Evaluator the North hand is a little too strong for a 15-17 NT. It is worth 17.2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=Kxxx+AK+KJ109+Kxx|pg||
nt|cascade: unfortunately the next range starts at 18|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yeah|pg||
nt|cascade: K&R will upgrade with all of those controls|pg||
nt|cascade: and the intermediates in the diamond suit|pg||
nt|cascade: what do you lead around to a strong NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: a jr.  not opening the W hand?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: grand actually making in @hs here|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: of course no way to come close though|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps W had some other view about it...|pg||
nt|xenya: we are well ahead of the other room |pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: Romania - Israel: 2 - 104: 1 - 25|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: running scores on http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/VGRama/minirama.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|laurentiu: not to overtake with the king of diamonds|pg||
nt|yuval10: can't see why didn't she bid 4@d then|pg||
nt|mug: might have worked better for South to start with 2@C over 1@S|pg||
nt|blade: hmm...with what kind of hand they try to X opps?|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|nt|mug: obviously was some kind of mechanical error or misunderstanding last hand|pg||
nt|Walddk3: This may roll in. Declarer is a hot favourites to get both black suits right after the pre-empt|pg||
nt|Walddk3: This solved one problem|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 4@D opening nexxt door kept everyone out|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Perhaps 4@D would have had a different meaning for this N-S pair|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Some play it as Namyats, a strong 4@S opening|pg||
nt|daman: 3@D|pg||
nt|sundiszno: this will be easy, I think|pg||
nt|sundiszno: just the kind of boards poland needs|pg||
nt|mikael_w: verry easy|pg||
pc|h5|nt|eggy: The problem with this hand is finding the strain to play in|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: 3swing for Romania on board 1|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: board 13'|pg||
pc|hT|nt|eerbil: yine gereksiz bi agresiflikle zona geldik|pg||
nt|MolvaM: cevapçýda 7 puan var. davete pas geçmek için kaç olmasý gerek?  6?|pg||

nt|xenya: they seem to be playing real fast here|pg||
nt|poohbear: they started late in the other room too|pg||
nt|sybarra: as we said at beginning  the "need for speed" table |pg||
nt|vugraphztt: israelian pair is known to be fastest in this contest|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think this may be able to be -2 on good defense|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 7 karo bordu konusunda apel komitesine lokum götürmeniz gerekiyormuþ galiba diye duyduk?|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, he can be happy now he didn't:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: indeed |pg||
nt|blade: partner has 16+, opps red...you have11 with 5 trumps...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eggy: but slam wouldn;t be on anyone's mind (except Roland perhaps)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gulyas: opps bidding and raising his AKQTx suit:)|pg||
nt|othered1: Much of the problem with 2-suited bids is deciding on range,  which should be rather narrow.   Philosophy that you just bid your shape in response doesn't work well with wide ...|pg||
nt|othered1: range'  |pg||
nt|othered1: Even juniors can decide to pass flat, 8-loser hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: they grow up fast :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: std lead @dJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: no @c lead since E did not open|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: but 2N is already too high|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 2Sa seems down |pg||
nt|fabsayc: for me, 1nt as passed hand not forcing, so 2@C promiss 4|pg||
nt|eggy: Sajr tells me that 2@D is checkback (presumably GF)|pg||
nt|eggy: apperntly N has shown 2-5-3-3|pg||
nt|sybarra: (what movie is that line from?) |pg||
nt|sybarra: line actually was "I feel the need for speed" |pg||
nt|poohbear: Had West led a@d honor there would be no guess for the spade but declarer can find out for himself|pg||
nt|poohbear: West a passed hand|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Jaak, these are junior players! lol|pg||
nt|kastan88: for me N hand is pure pass, with flat hand why to put head under possible guillotine or push opps to game. But you know: Junior blood!|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: No interference can stop us/them from bidding game ;)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|voldenuit: they play high as encouraging on the queen lead |pg||
nt|fabsayc: if 2@C is 3+, seems to me east should pass 2@D|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yuval10: specs suggested further than 2NT was 20-21|pg||
nt|poohbear: why didnt he cash @c ace?|pg||
nt|poohbear: strange|pg||
nt|xenya: he can do it now?|pg||
nt|poohbear: yes. I like tidiness though. This is sloppy :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i mean by crossing to hand in @Hs|pg||
nt|snetram: std. clever|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|kastan88: yeah, I have forgotten my junior years, they are so far (88oldish as you can see in my name:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Lies! You're still a junior lol|pg||
nt|poohbear: Needs to use 2 trumps to het back and forth|pg||
nt|poohbear: first real Glitch in the Israeli armor|pg||
nt|frusco: hi all|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|z_lasu: boards 14 and 15 also good for Romanians|pg||
nt|yuval10: *that|pg||
nt|mug: not a compulsory slam this hand anyway|pg||
nt|yuval10: can explain why W didn't want slam, but not why she didn't correct to 4@h|pg||
pc|s6|nt|voldenuit: 2@c isn't gazilli or sth like that?|pg||
nt|xenya: evidently they are playing some form of gazzili|pg||
nt|mikael_w: almost never wrong to lead a trumph vs partscore|pg||
pc|d2|nt|eggy: could easily get home this |pg||

nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 3 NT works here becuse of rhe @c and @d layout|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gulyas: Italy not interested in small IMP pickups, 3 gains, 10, 13, 14 IMPs:)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: This is not 100% sure kontract|pg||
nt|sundiszno: mirror hands, very nasty|pg||
nt|mikael_w: K@s and rhen 4 rounds of @d whith dummy in after the last|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, as a spec says, normaly you get this 3 NT in N:th hand, then its automatic 9 tricks when you get @h lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: club lead works better for defense|pg||
nt|voldenuit: nice lead |pg||
nt|mug: Padon concluded that he had been invited to bid at the 4-level, no higher|pg||
nt|yuval10: can't see how N doubles, with 0 tricks on def.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|namial1: me too|pg||
nt|cascade: especially against pairs that open and respond light as so many do|pg||
nt|cascade: Canonne was optimist again with her diamond stopper|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Qx is not a bad holding for NT|pg||
nt|cascade: sure|pg||
nt|z_lasu: should be down one|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: will see:)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: so only 50... an excellent save|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, well bid by E|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 3NT by North happens to be a fine contract because clubs are protected|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d is wow even as passed hand|pg||
nt|snetram: +430, 26PC both bal.|pg||
nt|sundiszno: yes|pg||
nt|sundiszno: well, normally I don't even know who will get to 3NT|pg||
pc|s4|nt|laurentiu: 4 more boards to go ... and 4 more imps for France|pg||
nt|laurentiu: to make a recap ... Romania didn't play except 2 boards with big gains|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: wow|pg||
nt|z_lasu: and probably next swing for Romania|pg||
nt|hedyg: might keep them out of 3NT|pg||
nt|snetram: now W can pass|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ovncylmz: good and true contract for me|pg||
nt|mug: must take tricks or they go on hearts|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he has more of a defensive hand he bids 3@s|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: true|pg||
nt|mug: shouldn't be too difficult|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ovncylmz: cant stay below 5@s|pg||
nt|ahalim: some badly needed IMP's for Belgium here |pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6 köre ulaþabilirler mi?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yorumcularrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr :) uyanýn|pg||
nt|murat: durmalarý çok bence :)|pg||
nt|eerbil: umarým ulaþmazlar diyeyim, kimbilir neler açýklýyorlar, operatör alert ile ilgilenmediði için bilemiyoruz|pg||
nt|poohbear: for running scores  http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Results.htm click on juniors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: THis will not be a big test|pg||
nt|blade: looks like a quick down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh, wait|pg||
nt|hedyg: and he did|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|kastan88: nice 4@H here, EW have good 5@C sac, but how (who) to interfer into bidding? Junior blood may be only|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H both majors I presume|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In that case I don't understand @CQ. Please explain|pg||
nt|blade: after that lead 2@H seems to be precision 4414|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I see|pg||
nt|blade: rememeber..they play unusual...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: very unusual|pg||
nt|blade: now other interpretation possible...with THAT lead....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But if partner has promised 4 spades, is there any reason not to lead one when you have 5 yourself?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|yuval10: UDCA carding so 8 = odd|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|MolvaM: operatörleri de uyarayým mý? :)|pg||
nt|relrikas: nerde  bizim operatörler nerde bunlar :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: evet bu arada türk BBO operatörlerimizi arýyoruz|pg||
nt|relrikas: 2 3 tane yanýmda beraberizliyoruz :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maçlar 20 boardluk|pg||
nt|xenya: very -- still declarer can survive it seems|pg||
nt|gulyas: unlucky here, 3 aces offside in 5@C|pg||
nt|snetram: E was too passive|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk3: Declarer in the other room got a club lead and knocked out @SA. The defence set up their clubs, but with the heart finesse on he did not need to play diamonds|pg||
pc|d8|nt|MolvaM: yani bundan sonra 3 bord daha var|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Vugraphztt: commentators????|pg||
nt|mug: reverse count perhaps?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the last round today, in about 1½ hours, we will be showing Norway v Denmark (U26) and Hungary v Poland (Schools)|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|cascade: no IMPs for France here|pg||
nt|mug: ah ic, odd = uneven|pg||
nt|yuval10: we're already in board 18|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: wow|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: while OR just made it to the halfway mark|pg||
nt|blade: eventually also 3514 possible,...anyway...@s lead seems obvious|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sundiszno: with weak NT, north will|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here its all up to rhe defense, to help dec. as little as possible|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk3: Michielsen showed an invitational hand with five spades, but Drijver declined the invitation|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|laurentiu: easy 11 tricks ... flat board ... I suppose ... on passe a la suivante :) ... as my fellow aymeric might say :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: günün son maçý 1730da ama türkiye vugrafta yok|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yarýn olur mu? bilmiyoruz|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yarýn sabah bileceðiz bunun cevabýný|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can in fact endplay north, but not this way|pg||
nt|voldenuit: declarer might play the king now |pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I don't blame him much with his aceless hand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|voldenuit: the queen |pg||
nt|eggy: 1IMP to France who are back to 24-6 ..|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is the last match in the Girls' event. The U26 players have a day off, and the School event (U21) will start later today; in around 5 hours|pg||
pc|c3|pc|dJ|nt|blade: the second costly board from N..:-(|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Some of the Girls will take part in the Schools|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: he can still endplay N|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is a debate as to whether an event should be named Girls ... and not Young Women or some such. I have no strong feelings|pg||
nt|sundiszno: unblock @hJ?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eggy: and leading the event by 7 VPS now|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||

nt|mikael_w: omg. dec missed to cover @hJ|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The Swedes doing everything right, the Dutch everything wrong since board 7|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cascade: I thought a Girl was a Young Woman |pg||
pc|c8|nt|poohbear: Tarnovski needs to underlead the @c hope declarer has the J and misguesses|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 1 down now|pg||
pc|hA|mc|8|nt|fabsayc: it was apparently always making if he guesses diamonds|pg||

nt|kastan88: website fro results: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Results.htm|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: I'm not sure, I'm not experiencing any issues with my connection. However, I don't need to open internet to look at the running scores for I am in the Rama theater :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Action time again|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Next session is promising to be a boring one, distribution-wise, for these hands have been extremely distributional|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sürekli þlem potansiyeli olan eller gelmeye baþladý|pg||
nt|MolvaM: erdinç in isteði gerçekleþti|pg||
nt|murat: bu arada 5karoya geldiler 16.boardda|pg||

nt|ozgull: 19 ve 20 inci boradu en baþtan oynatabilirlerdi böylelikle beklemezdik|pg||

nt|MolvaM: bize böyle operatör lazým|pg||
nt|MolvaM: operator? whats happening?  tell us please !|pg||
nt|voldenuit: hard to guess in @d the correct handle in @d is small for the queen and small for the 10 |pg||
nt|fabsayc: no he forces defense to play them|pg||
nt|voldenuit: interesint hand |pg||
nt|eggy: and also leading the Junior Women's event by 5VP|pg||
nt|eggy: The womens event ends tomorrow with France playing their last match against 2nd placed Poland  .|pg||
nt|hedyg: ensured his contract|pg||
nt|mikael_w: If dec just cover whith the @hK he was home safe|pg||
nt|sundiszno: and the poles have bid 6@d with two missing aces from the previous one|pg||
nt|sundiszno: so finally some pickups for uis|pg||
nt|mikael_w: as long as the KQ in @c was seperated OR both ar E|pg||
nt|sundiszno: a lot of @hs|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra2: hello all |pg||
nt|sybarra2: in the room I was just in,   4 @S was piece of cake |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, but a 25 year old is hardly a girl|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphztt: im in Rama theater waiting for table operator to imput biding|pg||
nt|fabsayc: call me crazy, i overcall 3nt with south hand|pg||
nt|cascade: another IMP for France |pg||
nt|Walddk2: You have to guess well to make 3NT here on a spade lead|pg||
nt|mikael_w: intresting board now|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kastan88: yeah, for sure NS will bid slam, but how many clubs will bid West after opening?|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: W has a good sac in any @C game or slam|pg||
nt|kastan88: 6@C for pick slam?|pg||
nt|voldenuit: I wld have bid 2@c |pg||
nt|cascade: oh is 25 old :)|pg||
nt|sundiszno: that's the case when you will find the trupm king, even if it' singleton offside :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 6 @s is still maximum for E/W|pg||
nt|sundiszno: but it seems no one will bid them|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I must go.  Thanks everyone and bye!|pg||
nt|blade: can see only 8 tricks...|pg||
nt|blade: if you guess well...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sry yes, diamonds don't break|pg||
nt|snetram: dificult choice|pg||
nt|sundiszno: isn't it a normal 2@h for you?|pg||
nt|sundiszno: really 1@d?|pg||
nt|sundiszno: with 5 @ss?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|laurentiu: on open rooms ... it was difficult to  bid 3nt or 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|kastan88: what now 6@D, 6@S or even 6NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: 6@S is on, even with the 4-1 trump split|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Needs some work though|pg||
nt|kastan88: 6@D too...|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Yes, but I'm a pairs tiger :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: junior Tiger?|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: You need to ruff two @Cs in dummy and get both finesses right|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: This is getting close to a Wald-slam :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Though the finesses are marked by the 5@C bid|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 3@c by nico?|pg||
nt|eggy: this looks pretty straightforward|pg||
nt|cascade: France did well to get to 4@H in the other room|pg||
nt|cascade: and then make it|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Once hearts are supported South is worth game|pg||
nt|Walddk3: We all know that feeling. No matter what you do, it turns out to be wrong|pg||
nt|sundiszno: he must have missorted his hand, since they even open 5 spades and six diamonds with 1@s|pg||
nt|mikael_w: brb|pg||
mb|p|nt|laurentiu: on 16-th|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the double may work well, ew will not realize they have huge diamond fit|pg||
nt|gulyas: bye Ed|pg||
nt|snetram: 1S - one of many options|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahalim: I have to leave now Adam, it's almost midnight :(|pg||
nt|kastan88: only 1 ruff: 4@D+4@S+3@H+ 1 ruff, you cant ruff 2 times, then you cant take finesse in spades playing 6@S|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Good bids by both Sorensen and Heim|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: You're right :)|pg||
nt|eggy: so lets hope it's on BBO|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s isn't bad, but it isn't making here|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: it's odds on, but not this time :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: only need to lose 1@h but both KQ@h are offside|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: ok, thanks Arifin :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: gn :)|pg||
nt|voldenuit: it's strange he bids 3@c with 4@s |pg||
nt|sybarra2: need to get the @S suit in soon |pg||
nt|z_lasu: 2nt = minors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So better for Germany to let Norway go down|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Walddk4: But since the age of the players starts at 13 and ends at 25, it's not that easy to name the series. Girls, Women, Young Ladies. Take your prick|pg||
nt|gulyas: 1@D probably showed @Hs, and S reversed, showing a mid range hand with 54 in the minors at least, so N thought its best to stop now|pg||
nt|sybarra: N does not have a hand to "write home about" |pg||
mb|p|nt|laurentiu: here ... on 4 hearts contract ... declarer has to guess diamonds|pg||
nt|ahalim: was nice working with you|pg||
nt|ahalim: bye|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: enjoyed :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, NS's bidding looks mysterious to me|pg||
nt|voldenuit: quentin robert has a huge hand now |pg||
nt|sybarra2: transfer |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i prefer a 2@C opener actually|pg||
nt|eggy: presumably 2H was texas|pg||
nt|gulyas: he hardly has a hand to speak of:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)   |pg||
nt|gulyas: it is obv that they have a misfit, so why move on, with such limited values|pg||
nt|gulyas: a good lead there|pg||
nt|sybarra: get out before X's start |pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|xenya: a @H or NT partial for NS here -- no reason for them to go any higher|pg||
mb|4D|nt|MolvaM: ok thanks :)  and good luck|pg||
nt|sybarra2: super accept |pg||
nt|Walddk4: pick even|pg||
nt|cascade: if we raise to game with our 14 counts that might disuade partner from raising with a 4-3-3-3 6 count|pg||
nt|Walddk4: embarrassing typo, I am sorry|pg||
nt|xenya: this is also OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: and then there was one... :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Oh my|pg||
nt|kastan88: now much intersting, is there possible to win 7@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: The handes are mirrored too much in distribution, can only discard one club on the @Hs|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: @CA lead might help|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the more i look at this auction, the more i think there is a wrong bid|pg||
nt|sybarra2: should bid 4 @S now |pg||
nt|sundiszno: 3NT serious|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kastan88: now just winning, taking finesses right|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Imo Mortensen's bid of 7@S is a bid reckless|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: You just asked P to bid a slam, she did and then you go ahead and bid grand?|pg||
nt|kastan88: more diffy with @H lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how are england doing?|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra2: 3 nt makes also |pg||
nt|z_lasu: he must find a Q@s but should be easy after double|pg||
mb|4N|nt|laurentiu: to be or not to be ... :)|pg||
nt|laurentiu: on the good side :)|pg||
nt|eggy: please don't ask|pg||
nt|eggy: although we have a slight chance of saving the test match|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they used to be called the "girls"  but this year  have matured to "women"|pg||
nt|cascade: more embarrassing if you were discussing the boys :)|pg||
nt|namial1: a swing for France|pg||
nt|cascade: i am sure you are forgiven Roland|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In the other room West led a diamond - but East played the six!!|pg||

nt|yuval10: well, 4@h is for sure not going to make|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: now even less options in 4@H|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: only option now: revoke :)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Good/bad 2NT presumably, but I am not sure. If it is, 3@S shows bad cards with a doubleton spade. However, Grönkvist is not to be denied once partner shows some kind of spade ...|pg||
nt|Walddk3: support|pg||
nt|Walddk3: This is just too much for declarer to handle|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont see a way to beat this|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and 650 to E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztt: Kib suggesting a forcing pass to show a void in @C over 7@C|pg||
nt|kastan88: oh yes my eyes old, club overruff|pg||
nt|kastan88: so lack of @S6 in South hand is trouble|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: What if you ruff with the @SK?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are we sure of that first double?|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: yep|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm not|pg||
nt|voldenuit: Nord isn't the kind to bid 3@c with 4@s he has put a @s in his @c probably |pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: U have to belive me:)|pg||
nt|xenya: oh we do :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we do and we don't at the same time|pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and in other room,  we discussed what was better|pg||
nt|snetram: next good score for France|pg||
mb|5D|nt|Vugraphztt: :)|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 4@c, 4@d, 4@h controls, 4NT RKC|pg||
mb|p|nt|laurentiu: he has chosen well|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu ilginç 1 kontrat|pg||
nt|eerbil: bir sürü elde batacak bir kontrata geldiler ama maalesef þimdi deðil|pg||
mb|6S|nt|xenya: 12 tricks can be made|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I have made worse if that is any consolation|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would not pass 2@c with the South hand . I would prefer 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: need @S8 or 6 in South hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikael_w: and one overtrick if N dosent take the @sA after @hA|pg||
mb|p|nt|laurentiu: now  it is done|pg||
nt|laurentiu: next|pg||
nt|Walddk3: He could well go 2 down, but it's part of the luck that it doesn't matter much|pg||
nt|Walddk3: They are 50's and 4@S went down in the other room too|pg||
nt|sundiszno: now wagner is assuming partner has @hA, since he control bid @hs|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: Or a void :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mtvesuvius: and the @c spots are perfect for declarer|pg||
nt|MolvaM: evet her empas tutuyor. batmayacak|pg||
nt|xenya: me also|pg||
nt|snetram: i like 4S openning, risky but interesting|pg||
nt|sundiszno: and why not 4@h splinter than?|pg||
nt|sundiszno: we all hopes they won't bid 6|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: on a @S finesse|pg||
nt|chessmaste: No - a swing for Poland! |pg||
nt|blade: mhh..why open 1@c with 16...why pass N with 8 and normal X shape?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|poohbear: might have a slam and play 2@c|pg||

nt|vugraphztt: Not very well bid by N and not very well declared by S|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 20 bordluk maçlar aslýnda uzun|pg||
nt|eerbil: maçýn baþlarýnda irfan'ýn ters zon durumunda pas dediði bir el vardý .. bir önceki elde ise muhammet yine ayný zon durumunda çok daha zayýf bi elle araya girdi|pg||
nt|MolvaM: birçok kiþi 16 borda alýþýk ve sonra dikkat daðýlabiliyor|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=10&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Oh - they did not bid game!|pg||
nt|namial1: no |pg||
nt|z_lasu: 4 @s here, but couldn't play small to the jack in first round of trumps|pg||
nt|gulyas: can NS reach this thin game?|pg||
nt|daman: France is too tough|pg||
nt|hedyg: last night at the club i had KJ10xxx in @s and Axxxx in @d and opened 4@s, reminds me of this last bd|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice that Krzysz opens those hands 4@s as well|pg||
nt|mikael_w: but was you realy vuln vs green ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes i was and in 1st seat|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok :)|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 5%d or 3NT on, because of the @dK|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 5@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|laurentiu: 4 hearts or spade on this board for EW, and a good defence for NS if they will bid 5 of a minoir|pg||
nt|laurentiu: something is wrong here|pg||
nt|laurentiu: it can't be on south this bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: OR are STILL playing board 11|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra2: lets see if e/w can find the @H game |pg||
nt|cascade: so 25 IMPs with two boards to go|pg||
nt|cascade: it is closer than it seems since Poland need to win by 13 to win the GOLD medal|pg||
nt|Walddk4: France need 13 of those, but you never know. It's round 13, played on the 13th|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: bu bakýmdan bu maçlarda son 4 bordda uyanýk olmak gerek. maç uzadýkça hata potansiyeli artýyor|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 3NT seems winning |pg||
nt|yuval10: that's remarkable, i'd say|pg||
nt|Walddk3: This is a very aggressive 4@S. On a good day you make it, but not today. All cards are wrong|pg||
nt|hedyg: opps had 5@c to play|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphztt: Meanwhile the Netherlands are expanding their victory on England: 25-5. France is beating Hungary by the same numbers, which brings them 5 VP apart in the ranking. We're looking at ...|pg||
nt|vugraphztt:  3 Denmark winning by 24-6 with more IMPs to come|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are you betting they find it?|pg||
nt|sybarra: want to be in what game?|pg||
nt|gulyas: if S rebids 3@Ds, they will bid and make 3NT, if only 2@D, thats where they will play it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S denying 4 I assume|pg||
nt|blade: right|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: and old-fashioned 1NT so to speak|pg||
mb|3D|nt|MolvaM: 4 kör deyip kapar mý?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: they will be here when we return tomorrow|pg||
nt|hedyg: i went -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|laurentiu: easy version to rich the final contract :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: I dont think:)|pg||
nt|eggy: well if they want to call themselves girls that's fine - but at 25 i guess most of them are women :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: For the superstitious|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, if they can cash 4@Ss, they can beat it, but its hard|pg||
nt|sundiszno: we play support dbls, so any other bid tnan dbl now denies three spades|pg||
nt|sundiszno: but 3@d is a little bit timid, maybe 3@h better|pg||
mb|3N|nt|MolvaM: hmmm, bilim yapacak irfan|pg||
nt|hobakan: 3 kör e transfer edip|pg||
nt|eerbil: transfer oynuyorlarsa bile 4kör demesi daha iyi bence|pg||
nt|hobakan: bence de|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: I'm told that 2@h is 8+ with 3@s|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if 2nt is a three card raise of some kind, need a bit more science|pg||
nt|voldenuit: one off in 4@s |pg||
nt|sybarra2: seems e/w not getting into the auction at all |pg||
nt|sybarra2: now 6 @H tricks and ak of @D later |pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: maybe 3 down is better|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: but i think will be only 2 down|pg||
nt|z_lasu: good bidding|pg||
nt|z_lasu: Poles at the other table may not find the game|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: 6lý körle yapmaz artýk canýmmmmm.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe down 2|pg||
nt|sybarra2: probably 4 down |pg||
nt|cascade: and each player has 13 cards - spooky|pg||
nt|cascade: south pessimistic with a spade misfit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This should seal it|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Takes a diamond lead to defeat 4@H it seems|pg||
nt|blade: XX again...?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Known as Kaplan Inversion|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztt: Denmark is 5 VP's behind France btw|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 12 now|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 3@d was a little bit timid, 3NT a little bit brave, good partnership :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ozgull: pass geçmeyecekse tabii|pg||
nt|MolvaM: geçer mi???|pg||
nt|eerbil: görüldüðü gibi gitti zon, muhammet de kýrmadý transferi|pg||
nt|hobakan: beyazdayýz diye teselli etsin birisi:(|pg||
nt|MolvaM: beyazdayýz|pg||
nt|MolvaM: teselli oldun mu?|pg||
nt|eerbil: 17.boardda zonda kaldýk ve geriye düþeceðiz|pg||
nt|murat: 17. boardda da beyazdayýz..|pg||
nt|hobakan: merci paþam 6 kaybederiz sadece|pg||
nt|voldenuit: I wld have try 3NT with west hand |pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|vugraphztt: With Poland tracing close behind: 1 VP difference at 124|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: But Poland is already winning by 25 from Romania, who is in last with 47 VP|pg||
nt|lokaty: now 6@D amazing luckly:)|pg||
nt|blade: 3@h...ok|pg||
nt|sundiszno: quick 12 tricks, yes|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|xenya: the entire auction doesn't look very convincing|pg||
nt|lokaty: Wainkowski thought, that double on 2@S is respond double with 4 @h and weak hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: this looks like a make. Declarer cant ask for a more perfect lie of the cards|pg||
nt|xenya: but 4@H can be made -- lots of friendly layouts in this session|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be "gut wrenching" to make however |pg||
nt|lokaty: he just have to close his eyes and make hundreds of finesses:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: right!|pg||
nt|sybarra: hope for the best and all is there|pg||
nt|poohbear: well Declarer will start Club ruff @d to hand @c ruff and play @d@d I think. after that easy trump play . Can score 3 trumps in hand 2 in dummy 3@ds and a @c and a @s|pg||
nt|lokaty: if he starts with spades first he will be able for an overtrick even:)|pg||
nt|blade: in the mom i hope match will be over soon.....|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and 2 more IMP:s :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra2: should lose either k of club or q of sp |pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: 3N would probably make here, yes -- on a@C lead, it hinges on a guess, but opponents' discards on the run of @Ss might be revealing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: better is to use 3@C rebid multi-way|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: let,s see|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk3: Finally some IMPs to NL|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or as we might bid in NA, 1nt-3nt|pg||
nt|sundiszno: bingo|pg||
nt|sundiszno: :)(|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|namial1: and @s  6-1  !!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|z_lasu: not the best line|pg||
pc|d6|nt|eggy: a it hopeful not to seek refuge in diamonds I think|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Marion may well ruff this to lead a heart up|pg||
nt|Walddk3: She doesn't really need the spade trick anyway|pg||
nt|poohbear: He knows North is 5-4 in @cs and @h and prob 1@s and 3@d|pg||
pc|d3|nt|eggy: not that it woul be much better|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Her spade cue bid with that hand puzzles me I must confess|pg||
nt|syl: 13 tricks|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mtvesuvius: This should make, probably with an overtrick|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and a few more IMPs to Israel|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: theres been a technical diff... game continued|pg||
nt|hobakan: 4 körün batarý?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s2|nt|MolvaM: 17. borddan da kötü elimiz geliyor maalesef|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it might have been wiser to stay quiet with the North hand|pg||
nt|eggy: still looks like N will make more than 4 tricks in this room|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes, playing @C was a good shot|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sundiszno: hi syl|pg||
pc|dT|nt|MolvaM: uzun süre önde giderken geriye düþmek üzereyiz|pg||
nt|voldenuit: thomas won't open 1NT with only 2@h I think in the other roooù |pg||
nt|z_lasu: but hard to win anyway|pg||
pc|d9|nt|hobakan: mecbur AR trefl çekecek|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is the down 2 line i envisioned|pg||
nt|gulyas: he will have a red face if he goes down in 2@D and 3no would have made:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|MolvaM: birçok seyircimiaz 16 elde þlem bulalým duasýna çýktýlar ama o elde þleme gidileceðini sanmýyorum|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 18. elde pardon|pg||
nt|MolvaM: onun yerine bu elde 4 köre batmalarý duasý daha yüksek ihtiþmal|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 9 tricks, next|pg||
nt|syl: helllo|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|eggy: probably the odds favoured finessing the 7 on the way back though|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk3: hmmmm|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Did she really play it like this?|pg||
nt|sundiszno: south squeezed?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gulyas: has to guess @Ds now to make it|pg||
nt|lokaty: he can not believe:), but nine of@H was better:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kaplan Inversion. The use of a 1 NT response to a 1@H opening, which promises length in spades, whereas a first response of 1@S becomes a relay bid. The Kaplan Inversion concept is ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: similar to the modern 1 NT forcing response|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, losing another @C and 2 @D tricks -- S has an exit card in @Hs, so can't be thrown in|pg||
nt|syl: yup|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gulyas: well done|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c2|nt|yuval10: and we're moving for the last board of the day|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|yuval10: she's going down now if E ruffs|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I am told that she *must* cue bid after North's 3@H|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Vugraphztt: wrong|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|namial1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=734&qroundno=13&qshowflag=1|pg||

nt|poohbear: down now|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|cK|nt|davidb: yesh hatihot ?|pg||

nt|xenya: well the line he took required !Q10 with N it seems|pg||
nt|xenya: @H|pg||
nt|xenya: i may be wrong though|pg||

mb|5D|nt|mtvesuvius: 2@s is intermediate in 4th seat I would imagine|pg||
nt|eggy: At the moment France lead 24-6 in VPs|pg||

mb|p|nt|laurentiu: I wish u a pleasant afternoon, ... or nice evening or beautiful morning ... if u are far away from Romania :)|pg||

nt|yuval10: Congratulations for Poland - they successfully retained their 2007 title|pg||
nt|lokaty: that was the only one lead after its cold:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: This could well make on a spade lead|pg||
nt|cascade: Negative Free bids would have worked well in the other room |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: meanwhile the OR in now on board 12|pg||
nt|mikael_w: @c lead might set it|pg||

nt|mikael_w: give up one @c trick and get a ruff, but then dec are afraid of finessing in @s on rhe way back|pg||

nt|yuval10: already 2H into the match|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I would think so|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: @c switch really kills it|pg||
nt|mug: thx everyone, really enjoyed|pg||

nt|xenya: thank you Shirley -- thanks everyone |pg||
pc|cK|nt|eggy: of course even if West wins the 1st diamond there is a possible Merrimac coup (Playing the unsupported K) followed by a switch if ducked|pg||
nt|sybarra: this seems routine |pg||
nt|mikael_w: then its bad luck|pg||
pc|c7|nt|gulyas: yes, a very simple 3NT to end this set|pg||
nt|yuval10: they were as down as 21st place after 4 rounds|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: 6@D looks perfectly reasonable once N knows about 6! Ds and an ace in S|pg||

nt|Vugraphztt: Hmm|pg||
nt|hedyg: after 2@S? i dont think so|pg||
nt|snetram: i am agree with Hedy, after 2H, 2S is better, after 4H means weak support|pg||
