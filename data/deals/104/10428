nt|ahollan1: great play - 2@D means only needs 2@H [1 finesse]|pg||
nt|poohbear: But South is squeezed as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: better buckle up folks - this last set could be rollercoaster ride|pg||
nt|poohbear: Might come down to West having to pitch a @d after South pitches one|pg||

nt|granovette: on board 47, two north-souths got to 6D, one to 7D, and one (here) stopped in 5D|pg||
nt|poohbear: now granovetter cant lead them when he gets in|pg||
nt|granovette: did he really play the ten of clubs?|pg||
nt|granovette: if so, probably desperate to keep russ off hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: looking at all the cards (north south)  I think I want to play 6D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CJ exit does the trick - doesn't that fit in with MG's discarding?|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|granovette: if they raise frequently with three-card support, they will have a method to find out more about opener's hand|pg||
mb|2N|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|granovette: usually it's 2N|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|granovette: that shows four spades, probably min.|pg||
nt|granovette: or maybe bal., not sure what they play|pg||
nt|poohbear: This hand will boil down to the @c guess|pg||
nt|stew: 2nt probably some sort of relay for a try - 3s said I don't care what it was|pg||
nt|ahollan1: earlier we saw  3@C=3@S, min -- I think that was Berk-Lair|pg||
nt|granovette: he will try to strip the hand before playing clubs in order to avoid a guess|pg||
nt|granovette: russ has nothing to lead; will probably lead a trump|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|d|mb|r|nt|granovette: now russ will lead ace of hearts (or will he UNDERlead ace of hearts?)|pg||
nt|poohbear: So the play might go trump lead @h up. Another trump. now third trump @h King and a @d |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: after Q3 in the USA2 Bracket:  Vernay 139 vs Wojewoda   Kasle wins as Epstein wd [down 89]|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|granovette: i think it will be easy to guess clubs now|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: Gran:  "chicken"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but kudos to Epstein for last minute fill-in when Freed withdrew because of illness|pg||
nt|stew: but again, Pam, it is so easy from where we sit|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|poohbear: Why do you think that pam? Cause Suth might not double with the @c K and a Q high @h suit?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops -- I forgot to type Wojewoda score ... 62|pg||
nt|granovette: yes, very easy from where we sit :-) but when South doubled with not much in hearts, maybe it's b/c he has nothing else|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: Berk:  I thought you showed extra but it is close enough.  we avoided the 3N trap|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|granovette: south doesn't know they aren't going to slam; with cards in several suits, he might not double hearts - how does he know that's the right lead?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|poohbear: Who do we play for the 4 trumps? I think South for some of the same reasons we discussed|pg||
nt|poohbear: doesnt matter on this hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer might start @cs right here|pg||
nt|granovette: i think he will try to strip the hand first - spades, then diamonds|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: needing to take care of 4th @D isn't it slightly in favor of playing South for long @S?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: that is IF you try to account for 41 split|pg||

nt|stew: now the moment of truth|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: Berk:  its come down to this|pg||
nt|granovette: had diamonds broken, he could claim by passing the queen of clubs around|pg||
nt|poohbear: He now knows long @cs on his Left BUT he cant afford to lose the wrong @c to South as he will get stuck in dummy|pg||
nt|stew: exactly|pg||
nt|poohbear: By playing A and a @c now. He wins against all Hx in South|pg||

nt|granovette: the double didn't work this time, but you have to go with your style; since south could stand only a heart lead, he doubled hearts; on another day, you pass and only a heart lead ...|pg||
nt|granovette: beats slam|pg||
nt|stew: Agree 100%  We make more lead directional doubles than mosrt|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: last hand E-W had a system misunderstanding:   Berk thought Lair showed extras.... so the slam tries gave declarer extra info from the double of hearts@@|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@H was 8+BAL or 3-places to play with opening bid or better|pg||
nt|granovette: they will end up in 3NT|pg||
nt|stew: after all this they'll settle in a flat 3NT|pg||
nt|granovette: when North finds out South's shortness is in hearts, he won't be interested in anything more than 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|granovette: yes, but they get a lot of extra bids :-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|stew: true|pg||
mb|2S|an|relay|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3 places-to-play means  4441, 5440, 5431 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think it may include some 5530 - but not all of them|pg||
nt|granovette: yes, North is keeping the relay going in case south has five clubs|pg||
nt|granovette: but south is going to show his actual shape and i don't think the 4-4 club fit will turn north on|pg||
mb|3C|an|3-card !D|nt|granovette: he will bid 3c, showing 3D; then north will ask and he will show 5S/4C|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|an|relay|mb|p|nt|granovette: now 3S, showing five spades and min.|pg||

nt|vugraphu7: before Berk passes, he says "this must be the auction to balance on"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Pam - other relay systems get a better handle on responder's strength by now -- do you think cumbersome to only know "opening bid+" at this point?|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: e-w are trying to figure out who's lead it is....|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: Berk, oh it is my lead|pg||
nt|granovette: no, it was very specific, 12-14|pg||
nt|granovette: with 15+ they have another way to go|pg||
nt|stew: as Larry points out it is wrong sided, but on relay auctions that is the price one pays|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|granovette: yes, sometimes the wrong-sidedness is "random," as you said, but it seems to me to be more unlucky than lucky|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh -- that makes much more sense then, thx|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: Russ:  this certainly wasn't the right side to play it from.  But I wanted to know if you had 5@C|pg||
nt|granovette: well, in my humble opinion, playing from hubby's side is always a good idea :-)))|pg||
nt|poohbear: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: MG asks about leads and carding.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and gives Russ a chance for a s***e|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: odd even discards|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: it seems like Berk made a great psyche of opening lead!|pg||
nt|granovette: he's eying those spot cards, noticing dummy's seven and his six, and wondering how safe it is to put in the queen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good news -- @C finesse into safe hand     bad news -- using @S entry eliminates some options|pg||
nt|granovette: i think he needs the finesse.... percentage is against spades breaking|pg||
nt|granovette: if heart finesse wins, the hand is so easy; if he loses, he has spades or club finesse to fall back on|pg||
nt|granovette: and if he doesn't take it now, he may lose second heart trick|pg||

nt|ahollan1: did @D10 add options we missed?|pg||

nt|stew: this could get real tricky now|pg||
nt|granovette: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why not @S?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Granovetter lucky the 9 of @hs is onside|pg||
pc|h9|nt|poohbear: well that ended all defensive hopes|pg||
nt|granovette: declarer thinking, whew|pg||
nt|granovette: he doesn't have to give up a spade now|pg||
nt|granovette: he just gives them a diamond; three clubs, three spades, two hearts, one diamond|pg||
nt|granovette: surely he doesn't think spades are breaking after 4-1 clubs|pg||
nt|poohbear: If lair plays a @s back Declarer prob needs to hook the @d 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: kibitzers screaming for duck of 2nd @C|pg||
nt|granovette: if hearts are 5-2 and they have the ace of diamonds, he might go down, but i don't think playing for spades to break is percentage|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not convinced, but need a LOT more time to figure it out|pg||
nt|stew: It is so so easy from  where we sit|pg||
nt|granovette: Larry Cohen points out hearts can't be 5-2 when 8 pops up|pg||
pc|s2|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|granovette: he has to find heart switch now|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: I think @D encourages  (North doesn't want a spade!)|pg||
nt|poohbear: Granovetter might need to get the @c Q out of his hand on the first lead of the suit|pg||
nt|granovette: mind you, it's unlike Ekeblad to play high card when he doesn't like the suit, but he didn't double 3D|pg||
nt|granovette: i think 3N bid shows the spade king for sure, so Ekeblad didn't have to deny it... maybe D9 will confuse MG|pg||

nt|granovette: yes, VERY|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: MG:  sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does ACBL have a rule against telepathy?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|poohbear: chance for an EW pickup |pg||
nt|poohbear: thats what I thought. but you seemed to be in Fl and hanging with Floridians in conversation|pg||
nt|lc: With 6-4 and weak, many East's rebid the 6.  But, when the 4 is a major (as in 6@S 4@H) you really should bid the @H ...|pg||
nt|granovette: will lair show his hearts, or rebid his spades?|pg||
nt|lc: Because such a good chance for a @H game.|pg||
nt|poohbear: I am with you larry|pg||
nt|lc: With 6@S and 4-minor and weak, most rebid 2@S. |pg||
nt|lc: Berk ALWAYS shows the 4 -- he is the most extreme in the game at this.|pg||
nt|lc: But Lair is the one with the decision here (maybe after 2@C overcall).|pg||
nt|lc: And, after a 2@C overcall he also has the option of passing with his minimum.|pg||
nt|poohbear: In the other room East bid 2@h freely and game was still missed|pg||
nt|lc: To be fair, it is not such a great game.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|an|takeout|nt|lc: Takeout, no doubt|pg||
nt|poohbear: true. 4@s is better than 4@h|pg||
nt|poohbear: @ds might set up in |pg||
mb|3C|nt|poohbear: when @hs break bad|pg||
mb|d|nt|granovette: it's still going to be difficult for East West to bid game...|pg||
nt|lc: Unless they have a "general rule" to cover this, there could be a misundertanding of this second double.|pg||
nt|granovette: nobody is taking the bull by the horns and bidding their hearts|pg||
nt|granovette: maybe lair will rebid his spades now and berk will raise to game|pg||
nt|stew: yes   this is where untested partnerships have a disadvantage|pg||
nt|lc: Obviously Berk intended it as cards/responsive.  But, will Lair know this?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|granovette: i am sure lair won't pass|pg||

nt|lc: Declarer has to guess @H |pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|c6|nt|granovette: i guess this is a "safety play" bidding hand where you have to avoid making an accident-bid|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|poohbear: no guess in @h play @d first|pg||
nt|stew: yes but not until he discovers the diamond K|pg||
nt|granovette: declarer should play diamonds first to see where the king is, then make the heart play|pg||
nt|granovette: you got there first, Fred :-)|pg||
nt|granovette: and Barry|pg||
nt|lc: We (DB-LC) have a rule that when they bid and raise, you can't make PEN X at this level.   But, this isn't the kind of thing a non-regular pair discussed.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Larry -- how much have David & Mark played together?|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: Berk :  sorry I could have just bid 3@D|pg||
nt|lc: A few tournies a year.    Bye all.|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: bye Larry|pg||
nt|robinswr: an example of non partnership|pg||
nt|pab1: DB and ML played last year in this same event|pg||
nt|granovette: i think when partner makes a takeout double and you have four of the other major, you should bid it|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|1N|an|clubs|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|granovette: i just played in a tournament where matthew and i played in a 3-3 fit, where our teammates played in a cuebid, etc. and these are established partnerships - bridge is HARD!|pg||

nt|granovette: as i predicted, north-south remained steady after the 3NT debacle; i think you get to the point where "tragedies" don't faze you that much (you get used to them!)|pg||
nt|stew: i certainly have|pg||
nt|granovette: :-))|pg||
nt|pab1: :-(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course   Seniors -- maybe the don't remember it because they CAN'T remember  |pg||
nt|robinswr: :)|pg||
nt|granovette: LOL|pg||
nt|pab1: can he bring this home, now?|pg||
nt|stew: i think  so|pg||
nt|robinswr: ruff a club and play trumps|pg||
nt|pab1: well that certainly works|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: Berk;  sorry (as he is thinking)|pg||
nt|robinswr: but what if trumps are 3-1|pg||
nt|stew: Peter, you should know by now that "what works" is obviously the correct line of play|pg||
nt|pab1: also, ruff a club, pitch a diamond on the heart, ruff a diamond, spade to ace, ruff another diamond, then lead a good club abd pitch the last diamond -- losing two trump tricks but ...|pg||
nt|pab1: no Diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: N taking a break while W thinking....says brb|pg||
nt|robinswr: for a cig|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other match this board was pushed at 4@S making|pg||
nt|granovette: who won the other match?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wolff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so looks like tomorrow 90 board final for USA1 slot will be Wolff vs Schwartz  the original 3 & 4 seeds [random seeding between the 2]|pg||
nt|granovette: matthew and russ won this last year - playing with lev-eisenberg, and milner-baze|pg||
nt|granovette: wolff and morse played very, very well|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: North not back yet, and West still thinking anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Ekeblad Granovetter will be playing in their THIRD Final within last month|pg||
nt|robinswr: he's smoking in the bathroom|pg||
nt|granovette: oy, don't remind me|pg||

nt|stew: yes survives 3-1 spades|pg||
nt|pab1: i suppose this works too?|pg||
nt|robinswr: has to avoid losing 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|granovette: i think it's classy that each player is playing his heart out til the very end....|pg||
nt|pab1: well, they don't know the margin is 28|pg||
nt|pab1: it does seem like they're all awake, etc.|pg||
nt|granovette: people who love bridge the most treat each hand with respect :-))|pg||
nt|robinswr: you never know what happened at the other table. It could be tied at this point|pg||
nt|granovette: right|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: If Berk makes this hand (he will) then the margin in the match is decided by the trump split on deal 46|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: MG says "sorry"|pg||
nt|stew: true JoAnna ,,, but there were a few others along the way|pg||
nt|granovette: we need the gong|pg||
