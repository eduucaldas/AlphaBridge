mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Matt probably didn't even think about immediate bid|pg||
nt|kit: Berkowitz might try 2NT here |pg||
nt|chip: Yes, to suggest 2-6 in the minors|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|kit: I guess it makes more sense to give North a chance to describe his hand, as well as risking 1NT getting passed out.  But what do I know.|pg||
nt|chip: seems N should pick clubs with his suit qualities.|pg||
nt|kit: but does 2NT show that, or is it an offer to play?  Partnership agreement needed on this.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip: our rule is that it is T/O since S passed last time, right?|pg||
nt|chip: Thought 2N is  fine also.|pg||
nt|kit: As it turns out, 2NT is actually the winning contract.  3@D would go down, and 3@C can be defeated also via uppercut on 4th round of hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Lair described 2NT to Eke, I think as not sure. As he puts down dummy "I understand it might not be natural, but with this hand I'm going to pass it & hope for the best"|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H!|an|8+ BAL|nt|kit: 6@D very exciting on board 16 -- on first round club finesse West must duck, but then declarer can make on squeeze if he reads it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=8+ BAL|pg||
nt|kit: oh -- it was a spade lead -- that changes everything -- now can make with ruffing finesse in clubs, as ace of hearts still in dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it has more meanings if unpassed hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Matt has options to ASK or TELL|pg||
nt|kit: 6@D needs guess for jack of diamonds.  6@C has other possibilities also|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but don't quote me|pg||
nt|kit: North will have nightmare lead vs. 6@C.  a spade lead will give declarer  12, a heart lead won't.|pg||

nt|kit: if 4@S is RKC in diamonds, as indicated, that means they will reach the wrong slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu1: That's what Matt wrote - Eke hasn't said, but I assume they know what they're doing|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|chip: Schwartz guessed to take a ruffing finesse in clubs after a spade lead in 6D,|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: If North can ask about kings (without having all the keycards) and finds the king of spades, he might put it in 6NT|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, East|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: Now just a blind guess on where to start the diamonds from -- but ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems so counterintuitive for the passed / limited to do all the asking|pg||
nt|me argent: seems convenient to missguess @Ds|pg||
nt|kit: Since he can pick up AJxx in South hand, low to queen is percentage (but not winning) play|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||

mc|11|nt|kit: I totally agree that it is counter-intuitive for weak hand to do all the asking -- and bad bridge besides|pg||
nt|kit: in slam auctions, it is almost always better if the strong hand is captain|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially when showing just shape doesn't locate where honors held -- like singleton @HA|pg||

nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|chip: Yes, I agree about who is asking. Still, the right contract deepended on a minor suit J. I EW had the DJ, they were in the correct contract, with the club J, 6NT best.|pg||

nt|kit: and that is exactly what he is doing -- but I'm not yet convinced it is the percentage line|pg||

nt|poohbear: but Declarer has no choice but to play on @ds|pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: here come the slams -- the big one this time|pg||
nt|kit: However this grand looks pretty easy to get to with any methods|pg||
mb|1H!|an|GF, many possibilities|nt|kit: Basically all West needs is spade fit and ace of diamonds, and surely he can find that out -- and East has extras|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H will show 8+ BAL [no singleton]  or  other hand that doesn't apply|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D!|an|asking|mb|p|mb|2H!|an|long clubs|nt|ahollan1: again showing 6+@C/@D some singleton|pg||
nt|kit: seems like Matt should be asking -- he can't hope to describe this hand, but he will know what to do if he gets some info|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1 or 2 suit  but not 3-suited|pg||
nt|kit: But apparently he is doing the telling -- seems so illogical to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: 3H or 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least this time ASK made by unlimited hand|pg||
mb|2S!|an|asking|mb|p|mb|3N!|an|5 !ss, 6 !cs |nt|kit: yes, but not by the hand which knows what to do with the answers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = @C    3N=5@S 6@C|pg||
nt|kit: now they should be okay if east can locate AK in both black suits in partner's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: lucky East had ace of hearts also -- without that, how would he ever be able to handle things?|pg||
mb|4D!|an|!s support, no something (can't read)|nt|ahollan1: Passell making 6@C on 18 so another change in leader coming|pg||
nt|chip: I think W can choose whether to ask or tell. generally asks if balanced and tells when unbalanced.|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: sorry -- i don't know bids after 3N :(|pg||
nt|kit: Passell is in 6@C on  18, but he definitely hasn't made it yet|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Pretty sure Matt wrote spade support and some more that I can't read - maybe Russ will write, his handwriting is better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very consistent for them to use the 4@D bid as Jan reports|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|poohbear: Passell looking like he is going down in 6@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where 4@S would say bad hand with support but 4@D slam interest|pg||
mb|4N|nt|chip: Any other 2H bidders over 1C with N?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Matt writing a bunch about 4@s - starts with 4@s usually - after that I can't read|pg||
nt|poohbear: how about just 1H|pg||
nt|kit: of course Chip -- what else?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H or 2@H -- but would never give relayers free run|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oooooo  Passell went down in 6@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Matt has pulled out a bid and put it back several times now - I can't tell if it's always been the same one|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|an|3+void|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so Schwartz maintains small lead|pg||
mb|7S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Ekeblad now I believe just has to gamble on king of clubs, and he is okay -- this is why I don't like showing voids in response to RKC -- can cut across partner's intentions|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ says that Matt has shown 5 @ss, 6@cs, 3 keycards and a void. Matt wrote some more for Berk|pg||
nt|kit: If West just shows his three keycards East can ask, find out about king of clubs, and be sure|pg||

mc|13|nt|kit: specs pointing out that West probably has king of clubs on bidding info -- true, but wouldn't it be nicer to be sure?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if 7@S bid with confidence or not -- but nice 2210|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: short break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: through shape show  could still have been @DKx @CAJ10xxx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S over the DBL probably helped clarify|pg||
nt|kit: it sure seems wrong that there would have to be any guesswork on a deal such as this |pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember   Passell-Lynch also playing a Big Club system -- i think their responses to 1@C are RM Lite, so artificiality there too|pg||
nt|kit: don't they make natural responses?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on earlier hand   they also started P-1@C;1@H  as bal positive|pg||
