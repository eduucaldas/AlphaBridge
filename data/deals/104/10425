mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kit: Bramley has some slam interest, but Stansby probably won't Q-bid with his minimum|pg||
nt|daman: Hi folks|pg||
mb|3N!|mb|p|nt|kit: hi George|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kit: this is probably a "non-serious" slam move|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|daman: did 3NT show an unspecified singleton?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: But if it is, I'm surprised Bramley doesn't give up|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|nt|kit: They could both be pushing too hard here, but I'm not sure just what the bids mean|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|pab1: the last letter of South's name is "N"  Swanson|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|daman: oddly enough it will make on a @H lead|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|kit: It will?|pg||
nt|daman: But John will probably lead the @D King|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: no sorry   one short|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: still a trick short I think -- 5 spades, 4 clubs, 1 diamond, 1 heart|pg||
nt|daman: vino rosa moment|pg||
nt|pab1: Need no Diamond lead, and 3-3 Clubs with Queen onside. |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kit: I'm pretty sure Solodar will lead a diamond anyway, looking at KQ of diamonds and ace of spades|pg||
nt|daman: now we know they play Rusinow leads|pg||

nt|pab1: 3NT down one on the Heart hook was a push|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: This had could prove difficult with the 4-1 club split and limited entries to dummy|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pab1: i can see various routes to 8 tricks, but I haven't found 9 yet|pg||
nt|kit: After success of last king of diamonds lead, why not again?|pg||
nt|kit: It may matter which club Stansby leads from his hand|pg||
nt|pab1: Solodar believed Declarer had 2 Spade stoppers, when he jumped to 3NT|pg||
nt|kit: If he chooses low club to queen and ace, and a club back, South will have to duck|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|kit: now with hearts favorable he could get 3 hearts, 3 clubs, 1 diamond, 1 spade, but that's still only 8|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|kit: However, long diamond might be getting set up here|pg||
nt|daman: it will be a struggle|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|kit: he can't duck this, as can't stand a spade through|pg||
nt|kit: and he knows that the lead was something unusual from South's play of the queen|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|kit: so far, so good|pg||
nt|kit: now ace of clubs, low club to 9 (South must duck), and a diamond, and it could come home|pg||
nt|kit: of course, maybe South doesn't duck the club -- then defense can take 1 club, 1 spade, 2 diamonds, 1 heart in time|pg||
nt|kit: And Stansby, seeing this, may duck himself, hoping North has Qx of clubs|pg||
nt|pab1: i don't think defense can get the Heart, in that line. If South wins Club and plays Spade, West wins Ace and drives out the Diamond|pg||
nt|pab1: then 5C, 2D, 1H and 1S|pg||
nt|kit: right -- if North has jack of diamonds -- but declarer doesn't know that|pg||
pc|cA|nt|daman: South may have falsecarded|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|kit: here we go -- now let's see which variatin happens|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|pab1: still a complex position|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|kit: Now will surely play a diamond.  And North will shift to a heart.  And then ????|pg||
pc|h4|nt|daman: up Simba|pg||
nt|kit: If declarer goes up, cashes the minors, and plays a heart he has 9 -- but he doesn't know that|pg||
nt|kit: He does know North's shape now at least|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kit: nicely done!|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|kit: great card-reading by Stansby|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|s9|nt|daman: South has to have something for his raise  N clearly has the @S King|pg||
nt|kit: right -- but South still needs exactly KJx of hearts for this to work |pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu8: sorr, contract was 3nt by Lew |pg||
pc|h9|nt|kit: Stansby got the doubleton heart in dummy he was expecting -- but not the hoped-for trump support|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pab1: 3NT by lew at this table, but shown wrong in Movie at other table|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|kit: may depend upon whether North might have stiff spade for 1NT rebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: I do not pass|pg||
nt|kit: bidding 2@S is a disaster if North has a stiff spade|pg||
nt|kit: But if your partnership sensibly never rebids 1NT with a stiff spade, then 2@S rebid is easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: Solodar doesn't seem like the type to rebid 1NT with a stiff @S|pg||

nt|pab1: for lew to open|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kit: certainly not 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: no  I agree|pg||

nt|daman: 1@H isn't all that unreasonable|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: 3NT is awful contract, but will make with incredibly lucky lie of the cards|pg||
nt|kit: Stansby will win and set up his long heart -- only to find it is already set up|pg||
nt|kit: However, he might not make -- say he runs hearts, and plays a diamond ....|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: doesn't hurt to have some luck|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|pab1: he could misguess Clubs later.  Run Hearts, exit a Diamond.  3 Spades ending in South, then a Club through|pg||
nt|kit: North wins, defense cashes 3 spades, and south perforce plays a club -- why would declarer guess to play for the drop?|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||

nt|kit: check out what really happened in spades operator|pg||
nt|kit: North probably went up king|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: thanks|pg||
nt|kit: If North does anything else, the contract will definitely make|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|kit: Now they can beat it (presumably) if North cashes ace of diamonds and exits with a spade|pg||
nt|pab1: North might not know what to do here|pg||
nt|pab1: North must cash Diamond Ace, else get endplayed later|pg||
nt|daman: he almost has to do that by default|pg||
nt|pab1: he might havve trouble reading the black-suit situation|pg||
nt|kit: not so clear -- declarer might have Axx of spades for example --- but I think declarer gave the position away with the spade play|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kit: I think declarer should have played a diamond up, leaving North completely in the blind|pg||

nt|pab1: 2S here should not promise extras.  It's important to show your fit|pg||
nt|kit: right -- 2@S shows 4 spades and 13 cards|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|kit: Now West can assume both sides have 8-card fits.  And he fits his partner's clubs -- but has Qxx of spades|pg||
nt|kit: so, of course, when in doubt bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|kit: and hope the opponents do the same|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: And so they do -- I don't like the 3@S call at all|pg||
pc|h6|nt|daman: neither do I   he said his piece with 2@S|pg||
nt|pab1: 3S seems to violate the "LAW".  likely to be an 8-8 hand|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||

mb|2C|nt|pab1: so kit, what would you open on that 6-6 hand?|pg||
nt|kit: my strong preference would be a takeout double on the South hand -- 4-card spade suit, some diamond support, extra strength|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|daman: Roth would have overcalled 1@H|pg||
nt|kit: on the 6-6 hand, I have no idea what I would do -- would depend on my mood|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kit: pretty hard not to drive to game on the South hand, but it doesn't make|pg||
nt|pab1: 3D here is like "last train"  only way to make a game try|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: My game try would be to bid game and try to make it -- not a success here|pg||
