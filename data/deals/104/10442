nt|kareno: Fred :)  Henry :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: hi Gang|pg||
nt|kareno: JoAnna :)  So it is really John playing with Arnie?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: n-s discussing flannery defense (played by e-w)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: yep:  John and Arnie|pg||
nt|kareno: Fred Hamilton's health has been iffy for the past few years.  I hope nothing's wrong with him today.|pg||
nt|stew: Will richie start off with a preempt ... probably|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: is there some New York history you want to share?|pg||
nt|henryb: John plays with anybody; forty years ago he even played with me|pg||
nt|reisig: my guess is 3@c |pg||
nt|kareno: Sort of a shaggy suit, but there are seven of them.|pg||
nt|reisig: Schwartz team is 4 handed ..so we always know who's playing :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|stew: or not|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: please welcome PO Sundelin|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||
nt|henryb: Many of the good young players in NY had animal nicknames in the sixties: the snail, the antelope, the hopper ...|pg||
nt|kareno: Hm.. interesting decision by Schwartz to start this set.|pg||
nt|reisig: welcome dear PO :)|pg||
nt|henryb: the Pipe|pg||
nt|po-s: calling all passengers, this is a test|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Sorry, my bad....    all great players look alike, that sort of thing.   Hopper playing with Swanson|pg||
nt|kareno: The Whale being perhaps the best known of them.|pg||
nt|po-s: it worked|pg||
nt|kareno: PO :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|kareno: This is the last 15 board segment of the match between Larsen and Kasle with Kasle in the lead by 20 IMPs. |pg||
mb|d|mb|3S|nt|kareno: Ahhh.. backing up, here's Richie again!|pg||
nt|po-s: anyway, it is comforting to know that EW have enough methods to create a discussion for NS|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: I have keyboard entry for bids and plays, and occasionally I start to type a chat and it displays as an unusual bid/play, I will try to watch that|pg||
nt|kareno: Paul Swanson most likely will raise to game here.|pg||
nt|reisig: Fisher became someone else,,,as we all suspected|pg||
nt|po-s: he sat in for the shuffling|pg||
nt|henryb: really? I think he has barely enough to raise to four opposite a balance|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: I was so mesmerized by the etymology of grasshoppers...|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, good - that allays any fears about Freddy.|pg||
nt|kareno: Or entomology :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu8: better|pg||

nt|robinswr: my guess is that he overtook the spade and led clubs from dummy and guessed diamonds|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|kareno: Just two more - Paul Heitner was the whale and Jeff Rubens was the snail for obvious reasons :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Oh ofc Karen:)|pg||
nt|henryb: the one they will probably find splits 5-1|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Roger Stern=The Snail|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|robinswr: since the opponents points had to be divided 10-10 aprox|pg||
mb|2H|nt|henryb: No, Karen, Roger Stern was the snail|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: that makes 2 snails?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|kareno: Oh, was he?  What was Jeff's nickname then?|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: You had to play against Roger to fully appreciate his name:(|pg||

mb|p|nt|reisig: I have a nickname for my friend PO ...but I'll leave it out :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Did Neil Chambers miscount his hand or are they playing a range that's not standard?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|robinswr: some pairs would rebid 1nt with the north hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|henryb: Jeff was not in the same class; the antelope was, though|pg||
nt|kareno: I must say, I would not raise clubs with Solodar's hand.|pg||
nt|henryb: Nor I|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: I think you New Yorkers are a very rough crowd.   Glad I am on the left coast|pg||
nt|stew: agree... I do not like the raise with only 4 trump|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|reisig: I never raise when they split 5-1|pg||
nt|kareno: And a spade void does not improve the hand.|pg||
nt|henryb: On the other hand, whenever partner has real clubs you might have a game|pg||
nt|stew: trump shift looks right |pg||
nt|kareno: Richie, ever the pragmatist!|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||
nt|stew: can't let declarer score his small ones|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: at the other table:   system is 1N nf.    E must pass W 1N because 2m would be canape|pg||
mb|4H|nt|robinswr: and i would have raised diamonds with schwart's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: i think after 1club - 1dia - 1heart Double by east is a T/o double of 1diamnd|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|henryb: at least it is not a violation of Burn's Law, although a violation of the corrollary|pg||

mb|p|nt|stew: when both sides play same suit something wrong|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphu8: I believe that is so|pg||

nt|Vugraphu8: Jones (seeing you dummy)  You're an animal.   3@D showed by worst possible hand.  Pass would be stronger|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks, Bob ... I don't know their system but I'm betting THEY do :)|pg||

nt|kareno:  "? ><lpkgbvcfxdezswacfvrgtnjmkl/|pg||
nt|pef: however they play 1nt as 15+ - 18- so that doesn't leave much room for opening 1 and jumping to 2nt, does it?|pg||
nt|kareno: Oops - blame the cat for that one!!|pg||
nt|kareno: That'|pg||
nt|kareno: That's why I'm confused about their auction.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: I played them yesterday and they were double dummy|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pef: was that "cattish", karen?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|kareno: Stansby's doubles showed primary clubs and the second was definitely takeout of diamonds.|pg||

nt|robinswr: 9 of hearts|pg||

pc|c8|nt|reisig: welcome PO :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, but not the original piano keyboard :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|stew: so much for my prognostication|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Schwartz saying the agreement about pass=interest doesn't apply here.  and he doesn't like being called an animal|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes, most play that bidding is the weaker of the actions there.|pg||
nt|henryb: It was a great result; just a greater one for Morce and Wolffe|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: big argument:  Jones:  I am trying to follow your methods.   Schwartz:  you are so crazy it is beyond belief|pg||
nt|po-s: little did Jones know...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Schwartz:  so we beat them easy....   Jones:  let's play bridge.  |pg||

pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|robinswr: should have led the 9 of hearts|pg||
nt|reisig: not possible ..he played @h Q|pg||
nt|po-s: or unblocked|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|kareno: The ten will be a call for hearts.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pef: i would have thought it better to duck a spade, getting spade ruff later and then hoping for one more trick in the end position for down 2|pg||
nt|kareno: The king would have shown spade preference.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|sT|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|c3|nt|pef: now unless defenders make a mistake it's down 3|pg||
nt|stew: the open room opened 2D with the North hand - old fashioned precision  short diamonds and played there|pg||
nt|pef: which will halve the margin in the match|pg||
nt|kareno: I think the order of cashing diamonds showed a heart card by Bramley.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kareno: Now the queen of hearts.|pg||
nt|pef: let's see if he gets it right and does that|pg||
nt|kareno: Remember east has called twice for hearts.|pg||
nt|kareno: Once with the club ten and once with a heart before a spade.|pg||
nt|pef: absolutely, but the play by all concerned in this match has been quite sloppy so far|pg||
pc|s9|nt|pef: well done|pg||

nt|robinswr: only way to beat this is a diamond lead then lead the 2 from Q2 of clubs  and have declarer misguess |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: why? wouldn't you either bid 2@c with W, or 1N perhaps?|pg||

nt|Vugraphu8: I bet Fred nailed it...so will go down 3 instead of 1|pg||
nt|robinswr: once you make an assumption (west has a stopper) it's hard to undo the assumption |pg||
nt|robinswr: but if south was 4351, he would have doubled 1club|pg||
nt|kareno: Clearly|pg||
nt|stew: good point|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: on spade shift, declarer will go up ace..doesn't need spade tricks, just club tricks|pg||
nt|stew: but as I've said many many times.  It is so easy for us in the Cheap Seats|pg||
nt|robinswr: if schwartz had a doubleton diamon he would have shifted to a spade by now|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: how we he be able to tell partner's card is spade K and not heart ace?|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|robinswr: the 53 were discouraging|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|robinswr: now he should have led a low club playing partner for Kx |pg||
nt|daman: Hi everyone|pg||

pc|c6|nt|stew: So here we are ... can't wait to hear this post mortum|pg||

nt|reisig: true|pg||
nt|daman: you are named after me Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even for the players :)|pg||

mb|1C|nt|pef: make it stiff heart and doubleton club and then I wouldn't force|pg||
mb|1N|nt|stew: hi Gene|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd seat -- Drew could do anything here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu8: welcome Gene (we all know you have excellent Hy-giene"|pg||
nt|robinswr: would jones overcall 1nt over a 1spade opener to get even|pg||
nt|kareno: Ewww, JoAnna :) :) :)|pg||
nt|reisig: 5@s is a good save :)|pg||
nt|daman: THAT was a strong weak 2|pg||
nt|pef: ugh, hate to open 1d on the north hand.  do you pretend it's 6-4 and open 1c?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: lol|pg||
nt|gff: hI Ladies good to be here but rathr br plsying|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: We have to take the good with the bad:)|pg||
nt|robinswr: will north show his five hearts?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wouldn't be surprised if MSC got some votes for each of 1/2/3/4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Well forcing would be much more likely to get you to slam.|pg||
nt|pef: at any rate, 4s appears to be the best game|pg||
pc|c5|nt|robinswr: the doubleton club says yes|pg||
nt|reisig: Nice bid Sonty|pg||
nt|daman: they better get their ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he likes his 4333 shape|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|daman: ugh|pg||
nt|ahollan1: protection against misdefense :(|pg||
nt|daman: 6@C was not on my radar|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how likely do you think @C lead from Onstott?|pg||
nt|daman: some players are devoid of green cards|pg||
nt|ritong: one down versus one down with a perfect lead looks like the right decision|pg||
nt|ritong: hi guys|pg||
pc|c8|nt|robinswr: east must have thought 2clubs was majors|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: 2@C was alerted by East "out loud"|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: North requests future alerts in writing|pg||
nt|daman: Salut Henri|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|reisig: 2@h promises ...how many @hs?|pg||

nt|daman: hard to say|pg||
nt|ritong: hey buddy:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gff: issn't two diamnds enuf? why 3 clubs  by Solodar?|pg||
nt|robinswr: out loud is a clear violation|pg||

nt|gff: zorry cant csnt p;lsy 2 hesrts|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: director on the way|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Director here now|pg||
nt|robinswr: i guess the only reason east would bid 2hearts is if he was 5-6 in the reds so therefore 3diamonds is a possibility |pg||
nt|reisig: The only thing I say out loud ..."need a bathroom break"|pg||
nt|robinswr: same here|pg||
nt|stew: and in the seniors they are needed far more frequently|pg||
nt|robinswr: i place the alert card on the bid until my opponent tells me to take it off|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Swanson says:  I did alert outloud as Stayman, but I don't think anyone heard.   Turns out Jones says it was also alerted as Stayman on his side of screen (I didn't see it)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: so apparently no problem, since both alerted as Stayman|pg||
nt|kareno: If you're going to bid game :)|pg||
nt|pef: bates and sontag did get to 4s, so this could take the match back to even if they don't reach game here (and bates-sontag make 4s, of course|pg||
nt|stew: 1Diamond seems fine to me|pg||
nt|pef: seems like any reasonable line allows you to make 4s if you get there|pg||
nt|kareno: Could get dicey.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|stew: Well!|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: down 1 not vul seems like good insurance against possible vul 5@S|pg||
pc|dT|nt|robinswr: some play 3diamonds invitational but NF can be passed if the raise was 3-card |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|robinswr: don't understand the trump lead since dummy could be void in clubs|pg||
nt|robinswr: and you're supposed to lead low from 2 when leading trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Kib has a good Question,  so why not bid 2@S after 2@H|pg||
nt|kareno: I certainly would have led a plain suit, not a trump.|pg||
nt|kareno: It may not have occurred to John Solodar.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: how do they find 4-4 spade fit??|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|kareno: Rare jump on only two trumps.  Two rounds of diamonds and a heart could cause a problem.  But the clubs are friendly..|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: I think 2H was transfer to spades|pg||
nt|stew: aha   now that makes sense|pg||
nt|kareno: Then 3@s makes sense.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: i stand corrected|pg||
pc|c3|nt|robinswr: i've seen situations where you lead top and later you would have been able to overruff with it|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: i heard some talking which i could only guess at|pg||

nt|ritong: several ways to make the rest, let s see which one drew will adopt|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|robinswr: setting up the cross ruff before drawing trumps|pg||
nt|robinswr: he might need to ruff the 4th diamond and the club in dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ruff @S, 1 round of trump then switch to @C ruffs?  nope 1 trump first -- i was so close :(|pg||
nt|kareno: This'll work|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ritong: heh|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|robinswr: he won't draw trumps since they could be 4-1|pg||

pc|h2|nt|robinswr: solodar has to guess spades|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|reisig: nah ..@d will be good|pg||

nt|ritong: what would you do?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: For this hand, I propose a break for a cup of tea ... (_)? ... and a few cookies ... OOO.|pg||
nt|robinswr: 2diamonds was probably some sort of drury and 2hearts shows an opening bid|pg||
nt|kareno: Not much interest other than staying out of slam :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I think they use 3- and 4-card drury, useful with four-card majors.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: the defense to 4@S (last hand) might have a shot if West ducks first trump, and then sees trump suit pref ....may be able to switch to heart away from Queen|pg||

mb|p|nt|stew: this will be only the second push of the set|pg||

nt|ahollan1: good run from the penalty dbl|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: John and Drew discussing their methods|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kareno: North's hand a fairly normal 1NT even with 5-4.  Not good enough to reverse.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: i vote 1nt|pg||
nt|kareno: I would not invite at IMPs with that west hand.  I just biddum game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: morst invited in the OR and wolff rejected|pg||
mb|1H|nt|daman: 4@H is on for NS  but 4@S is a useful sacrifice for EW|pg||
nt|kareno: Splinter most likely as most descriptive.|pg||
nt|kareno: You can't be that fine-tuned.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: And 1NT has a certain preemptive value also.|pg||
nt|stew: it's hard to make up if you don't open a NT ... same shape with 5M and I wouldn't however|pg||
nt|ahollan1: drew in 3rd seat with 6@H -- where have we seen that before|pg||
nt|daman: they must play super weak 2 bids in 3rd and 4th seats|pg||
nt|daman: my Mom would open that 1@H|pg||
nt|pef: yep, I agree, just too many minimums produce a game|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Vugraphu8: how about if 5@D and 4@C??|pg||
nt|robinswr: why wouldn't you not lead a spade on the last hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: with 2 spades declarer has 0 or 1 probably|pg||
nt|stew: when the hand that is inviting has shape the high road tends to be best ... partner simply can't asses his values|pg||
nt|pef: pretty ugly 1h overcall. hard to fault chambers for bidding 4h, but this will be a swing back to the larsen team|pg||
nt|kareno: Also opener has poor trumps, which can make the decision harder for him.|pg||
nt|pef: such language, fred :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pef: wow!|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Then I open 1@d|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: In the OR Granovetter, in the play, pitched a club on the last dimaond, S\so Wolff guess the clubs to make 2NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: I still open 1N...want to shut out their majors|pg||
nt|robinswr: you could open 1diamond and rebid 2clubs on  this hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: would you, Steve?|pg||
nt|stew: I would also still open 1NT|pg||
nt|robinswr: but i would open 1nt|pg||
nt|pef: bigger swing than I thought here, this looks like it will make, but some handling problems|pg||
nt|kareno: I can't imagine Stansby has anything to think about!|pg||
mb|p|nt|stew: I think trump lead defeats this  just cant handle it|pg||
nt|kareno: Spade would present problems.  He may well make this on the expected heart lead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: lead the king of hearts and find J10xxx of hearts in dummy and the club ace|pg||
nt|barnets: there will be time to get the spade trick unless dummy has very strong clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i bet Bart Bramley also treats this hand differently than Drew|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kareno: Yes, you could - and I used to do that, but now prefer 1nt|pg||
nt|barnets: could be thats why leads are so difficult for everyone|pg||
pc|sA|nt|robinswr: i open 1nt whenever possible|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: me too!|pg||
nt|stew: so here we are|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Pushy 3NT here:)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|robinswr: in the open room no stayman so wolff was worried about his hearts|pg||
nt|kareno: North likes his five-card club suit.  He will have to play anti-field to make it.|pg||
nt|kareno: Trump, he wins and plays a heart.  I think it makes with a trump lead.|pg||
nt|pef: well it's 13 imps if he make this|pg||
nt|kareno: Or, as a spec points out, draw trumps, concede a diamond and get on to the next hand.|pg||
nt|stew: that 10 third of trump is hugh I think.  not enough communicatioin to set up the diamonds and not enough trump to ruff all the loosers and get back and forth|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|robinswr: right|pg||
nt|pef: I think a spade lead is actually best|pg||
nt|stew: yes  I was wrong (frequently) trump lead he can claim   the spade though is great for NS|pg||
nt|kareno: Tough hand now.  May not be able to make on this lead.|pg||
nt|kareno: Duck spade for sure.|pg||
nt|pef: duck the spade and south wins and returns a trump seems to beat it|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks right to me to duck the spade..|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|stew: but I don't think he will|pg||
nt|kareno: Spade out is tougher as I said.|pg||
nt|stew: great lead|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Vugraphu8: that old rule of eleven....|pg||
nt|stew: he knows he's in a pushy game so will take the percentage line|pg||
nt|robinswr: its not anti field its anti percentage|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: That's what he did, in OR|pg||

nt|kareno: This could be the wrong moment for Bart Bramley to enter the auction..|pg||
nt|pef: or at least get 3nt played by south, which is a far better spot and might even make|pg||

pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: only 3 imps -- but if 3@S down or 3@D making or down 1 then gain a lot|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vdoubleu: I give partner an early heads up---but I realize that very few players do (pass)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pef: so he'll take one spade finesse, which is safe because the worst he can do is lose 4 hearts, a club and a spade at this point |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: well 3@D down 1 = push|pg||

mb|p|nt|stew: So Schwartz has a chance for a fair pickup it the keep the bidding in check|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can i try to claim that was a typo?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|kareno: North's was an IMP bid - you bid a game because it might make and there's a premium for bidding and making a vul game.|pg||
nt|kareno: Hard, with the north hand so suitable for spades.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: John really bid 2|pg||
nt|kareno: 4@s would do it to close the gap completely.|pg||
nt|kareno: Promote the club queen.  |pg||
nt|pef: lew may upgrade his aq of clubs and just bid 4s here--if he does larsen will be in the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: but the opponents will not let them play in 2spades|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe onstott considered that a three level opening cannot be such a good suit|pg||
nt|pef: ah, great minds think alike|pg||
nt|kareno: There it is!!|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|stew: Same auciton at other table except now North (Wolf) blasted into 4s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh i believe the bid -- was trying to claim MY 3@D was typo :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|barnets: west did not overcall last board 1@S and then led a diamond v 4@H so that is making too|pg||
nt|pef: so 10 imps and larsen in the lead by 4--it is the first time they've led in this match|pg||
nt|pef: so specs, worth the wait|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: The most important time to have the lead is coming up in two more boards :)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|barnets: 41v 3 so far this set|pg||

nt|kareno: This match is 60 boards.|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|barnets: asking for a diamond control|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|barnets: by east not west|pg||
nt|barnets: west thinking between spades and nt will bid slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|ritong: on the other hand, a two level opening cannot be such a long suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: then again - he doesn't know what Drew's 3rd seat 2@H looks like, so why should we know what 1st seat 2@D shows|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: east knows west has not the @DA|pg||
nt|barnets: as he cued hearts first|pg||
nt|barnets: so mabe he should not have picked clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|stew: true, but it's our philosophy to presume it's their hand over 1NT and not expect the world when partner interferes|pg||
nt|barnets: with lead coming thru dummy|pg||

mb|p|nt|stew: you were right Karen|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: let me check again...yes this is the real auction|pg||

nt|Vugraphu8: it is fun to do this,  if you (kibs) ever have a chance, I highly recommend you give it a try|pg||
nt|stew: now can he really make this?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=(4+/5+) @C & @D, 0-11 HCP   was also an option |pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Drew just asked how far ahead of the other room they were|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for EW  1@D-3@D = 9-11, INV, very good 6+@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu8: this was alerted as key card|pg||

mb|2H|nt|kareno: This lead will help!!|pg||
nt|pef: in the open room, e/w played in 4d.  gaylor kasle found a great end position to make 4d.  take a look at the play in the open room if you want to see a pretty neat hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: pure thievery now|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: then again -- |pg||
nt|ritong: if 4@h is a sort of key ask, now situation is bizarre for sontag|pg||
nt|pef: however, if bramley bids 3nt here, that's not so easy to defeat|pg||
nt|pef: so, this board may easily decide the match.  |pg||
nt|pef: north has only one good lead, the heart K and he's very unlikely to find it|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Bart just announced 2N was natural by a passed hand, 3D undiscussed, but if he were not a passed hand 3D would be afragment|pg||
nt|kareno: This doesn't seem to have much play - looks like a pickup for Kasle to me.|pg||
nt|pef: well let's see on a club lead declarer can take 3 clubs, 3 diamonds, 2 spades and heart |pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: on a spade lead declarer can take 3s, 2c 3d, and one heart|pg||
nt|kareno: Declarer rates to be very well upholstered in clubs on this auction.|pg||
nt|pef: it's true that n/s might be able to untangle the heart tricks is they do it quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: It this is going to be nip tuck and probably decide the match|pg||
nt|pef: chambers may win this and return a low club, if so, bramley may stick in the 10, schermer has to avoid continuing clubs|pg||
nt|kareno: Bart has sparkled on some declarer play hands - let's watch him. |pg||
nt|pef: chambers has his first difficult problem, the k of the 9.  unfortunately after thinking about it so long, bramley will know he has the k|pg||
nt|poohbear: 60 looks like a swing to the Kasle team|pg||
nt|pef: I'd bet either way if someone gives me 6-5 odds :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: sorry Larsen|pg||

nt|kareno: So we know south didn't have J9 of spades by his tempo.. that suit is known.|pg||
nt|pef: a great finish, bart bramley will either be the hero for making this or the villain for overbidding|pg||

pc|d8|nt|kareno: Thanks too, to the USBF (especially the organizer, Jan Martel) for allowing us to join in their tournaments!|pg||

nt|Vugraphu8: Drew asks about 4h Bates writes 0 or 3|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Bates writes while Drew thinks about lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd ask about 4N also|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kareno: Thanks to BBO for a fabulous platform for watching these great events week after week.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|robinswr: dummy could be void and guess what dummy is void|pg||
nt|pef: ok, that is the one suit that surprises me|pg||
nt|kareno: Tricking them by leading hearts himself.|pg||
nt|pef: but bart may have decided the simplest path to 9 tricks is hearts 3-3|pg||
nt|pef: and several of the commentators from the open room are telling me the last board has swing potential either way, also|pg||
nt|kareno: Specs, I really cannot chat with you all :)  |pg||
nt|pef: I would think schermer knows the k of hearts is the right exit here--Bart can hardly have three hearts on this auction|pg||
nt|pef: but again, easier said looking at all four hands|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pef: there will be a whole bunch more long pauses on this hand I think I can safely predict|pg||
nt|kareno: You think :)|pg||
nt|pef: karen, if you were roland, you'd have some cricket stories around now :)|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|pef: I think we're now down to 10-1 (or worse) against |pg||
nt|kit: no -- but I sure don't like winning the ace of hearts there|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kareno: He must have been thinking of Allison's Law, circa 1962, "There's always a ruff in the dummy!!"|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: next version of bbo:  microphones at the vugraph table!!  (I hope)|pg||
nt|kit: if North had been left on lead who knows what he might have done|pg||
nt|pef: safely up with the ace|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|pef: yeah, I don't see any advantage to winning the ace at that point|pg||
nt|kareno: Had to duck that ace.|pg||
nt|kit: I'm sure if South worked it out he would know it was safe to duck the club, but he saw the setting tricks|pg||
nt|robinswr: the advantage is that is that he's beating the contract|pg||
nt|pef: so 9 imps with a board to go|pg||
nt|kareno: So five IMPs to Kasle and now a two-board match with one IMP between the teams.|pg||

nt|stew: yes the defense was suspect in the open room|pg||
nt|kareno: I am guessing the contract will be the same in here as in the OR|pg||
nt|pef: who could ask for anything more|pg||
nt|kit: in other room 2@S could have been defeated 2 tricks, but defense slipped at end and only beat it 1 -- may swing the match|pg||
nt|gff: Cole Porter|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|kareno: Spectators, don't give up your seats!!  There will be 75 more boards coming to you in this great matchup!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: bad news guys -- 4@H can go down &  4@S can't make|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|stew: and so it is Karen|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tight before the last board. NOW A TRICK CAN BE ENOUGH|pg||
nt|kareno: We are assuming, of course, accurate scores |pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|kareno: Hi again, Gene :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=2-way Checkback|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: alerted|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: same auction it looks like|pg||
nt|pef: pass probably won the match|pg||
nt|gff: good guess anyway|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: huh -- that's not consistent with 2-way checkback which is marked on Convention Card|pg||
nt|kit: so Kasle wins by at least 1 unless Stansby finds a way to make, which seems impossible|pg||
mb|p|nt|gff: sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,too moch tempo for porter|pg||
nt|kareno: I can't see any way to make this one.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: it says NMF by Passed Hand   2-Way by Unpassed hand|pg||

nt|poohbear: keep in mind that our score is not official|pg||
nt|pef: otherwise, kasle wins a very hard fought match, and we can all go eat our dinners (at least those of us in this time zone)|pg||
nt|robinswr: queen of clubs said i like hearts|pg||

nt|ahollan1: for specs who are asking   in 2-way Checkback [aka 2-way NMF]  2@C forces 2@D to play 2@D or show some invite|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: then 2@D over 1N is artificial game force|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||

nt|pef: any of the specs who wants the cioppino recipe send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to "Italian Fish Stew" at BBO :)|pg||

nt|rodal f: And a @H?'So N missed the def|pg||
nt|stew: and there you have it   1 IMP|pg||
nt|kareno: And to BBO for providing this great platform for reporting bridge events live every week of the year.|pg||
nt|pef: wow, he wouldn't have slept if the fifth to last card he played cost the match|pg||
nt|robinswr: we don't know since the scores are unofficial|pg||
nt|gff: wow|pg||
nt|kareno: And of course to the specs for keeping us awake!!|pg||
nt|pef: there will be lots of checking the scores, I think all errors were corrected, but 1 imp is pretty easy to find sometimes|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pef: remember still lots of matches to go|pg||
nt|pef: there's the last 30 boards of the first final|pg||
nt|robinswr: i hope you leave the table open until they compare scores|pg||
nt|kareno: And if Larsen find an IMP this could go on late!!|pg||
nt|pef: and 60 boards of the winner of this against the winner of the other flight B semi|pg||
nt|pef: and then 60 boards agains the loser of the flight A final against tomorrows flight B winner|pg||

nt|Vugraphu8: I believe that it is now official, Morse is still up big, I will try to get an actual total and BRB|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Morse is up 171 to 99|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Jan knows of the error and said that it is being worked on.   Good night all, see you tomorrow|pg||
