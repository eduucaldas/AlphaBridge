nt|Walddk2: Morning guys|pg||
nt|ukdorj: usally Anna Christa and Signe is playing in the open room and Signe sitting East|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In that case  Thomsen  (East)     Ege  (West)   but we can't be certain|pg||
nt|ukdorj: So if the operator can verify that West is very small with long hair, then i guess we have the name of the danish players :-)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: The thin-ish game was bid by the Danes in the closed room, so 7 IMPs|pg||
nt|vugraphzts: hi everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzts: a bit of a rough start|pg||
nt|ukdorj: Ege prober name is Anna Christa Ege why she is called Ace. Signe and her ha already won two championships in denmark|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello Mihaela|pg||
nt|ukdorj: last year they won the womens pairs and this year they won junior pairs|pg||
nt|vugraphzts: the players in the open room started early, i'm guessing nobody told them they had to wait for 10 minutes in order to have comparisons from the closed|pg||
nt|vugraphzts: so the 10 minutes break came after the 1st board|pg||
nt|ukdorj: Signe is 17 and had finished 11th grade and Ace had finished 8th grade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Anita Jensen|pg||
nt|babydolldk: Hi|pg||
nt|ukdorj: In todays bulletin you can meet the english girls team. All of them is studying at different university - so quite a gap|pg||

nt|Walddk2: The German East next door rebid 1NT and is playing there|pg||
nt|ukdorj: or 2NT - but 3@d must be a safe contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is no way to bid the East hand accurately unless you have a special three-suited opening on your CC. Very few have|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: with 1444 the textbooks recommend 1@D and over 1@S .... some advocate for 1NT, others for 2@C. I am in the 2@C camp|pg||

nt|ukdorj: AQJx and AK10x is a good argument for 1@d followeed by 2@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can't believe that Signe is taking this long. It's not like her at all :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thomsen is usually fast, whereas Ege likes to think things through for a longer period of time. I guess her father taught her that (ukdorj, Ole Raulund is Ege's dad)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ole is also pretty slow :)|pg||
