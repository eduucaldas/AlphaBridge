pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @S7 return might have persuaded Fredin to go for the drop. Could have been from Q107 or Q97 though|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It was hard for Fredin, because he can see the Khojgaard is sort of endplayed ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So it was quite possible he had to switch to a spade from the queen|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If I were East, I would have had the setting tricks on the table 5 minutes ago|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|werge: Terrible start for Pharma - look at this bid - and the result - in CR|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Imaginative Peter Fredin|pg||
nt|bjacobs: imaginative if it works; foolhardy if it doesn't|pg||
nt|werge: 5 tricks with a @H-lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How many would have balanced with 2@H? (you don't have to answer all 688 of you)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|werge: Fredin - and Krøjgaard|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|geot: I think this balance by Fredin very often is done exactly on a four carder. He did not overcall in the first round in this vul. So Partner should be able to move if neccesary ...|pg||
nt|geot: (North must have a decent hand...hcps)|pg||
nt|werge: This is WELL DESERVED - wenn Wests hands has to be opened 1 @D!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|werge: 1 @C might be possible|pg||
nt|bjacobs: There's a risk though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Agreed Geo, but you often have better cards than 9xxx|pg||
nt|geot: always a risk|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's true that 2@H is probably 4, but if South just has a bunch of clubs, there's nowhere to hide|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, at this vulnerability, I guess it's a worthwhile risk|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|bjacobs: Well, it's a fair point - he gets nailed via some value-showing double be East, converted by West|pg||

nt|werge: Listen - you have A K 8 7 6 behind, what COULD be a @D-suit. Let the opponents have their fun...|pg||
pc|d6|nt|geot: Lots to be said fot that, Hans, But the important thing is if you bid is that partner should not leave him in 2 of a major in such a situation if he has only 2 (or 1), and ...|pg||
nt|geot: surprisingly often it is possible to play even in 2NT. |pg||
