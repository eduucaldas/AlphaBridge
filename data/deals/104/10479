mb|p|mb|2D|nt|hedyg: no 1NT in S..|pg||
nt|mariner1: the running scores will probably not be active until we have played a few boards, so|pg||
nt|mariner1: refresh as needed|pg||

nt|andyv:  ty:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS not finding the @S fit?|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice aggresive michaels used in Closed Room|pg||
nt|hedyg: S could have have bid either 1@s if they play that as 4+ or 1NT, his silence may cost the board|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hedyg: dont know about nice, but it worked|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: S is out of the picture here|pg||
nt|andyv:  you prefer "nasty" michaels, Hedy?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i like 5-5 michaels|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: except if you have agreements that it can be less|pg||
nt|andyv:  equal vul i'd agree with you|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: and as Hedy said S could have bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  S silence has given E/W too much freedom in the auction|pg||
