mb|p|nt|lestergold: now one would hope that e/w could reach something more lucrative than a diamond [part score holding these combined assets here|pg||
nt|lestergold: west dependiong on methods can tart with a quiet 2d which should attract a courtesy raise from east than a 3s cue bid should produce a 3n fromhis pard|pg||

nt|lestergold: bidding in open is unbeleivable butchery of strong hands|pg||
nt|lestergold: in the open room west had similar opportunity but just decided to conceal about 6 points or four playing tricks form partner|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 3c absurd|pg||
nt|sga1: 2@d must be waiting bid although in modern day resonses, most would bid 2@H - super negative with this hand.|pg||
nt|lestergold: game hard to avoid but shouldnt make only 8 tricks even if south fails to lead a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: floating the double absurd why not try 3d|pg||

nt|lestergold: just er the -6 ?? undoubled|pg||
nt|indianidol: cant be 3nt for sure..something wrong..operator is this true|pg||

nt|sunit: should hace been -630|pg||
nt|lestergold: a quiet 2d will lead to the 3n game by a normal auction|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot of players would overcall with the north hand but my view is that it has to be a better hand or 6 card suit  to justify at unfavourable vul|pg||
nt|sga1: Yes absolutely.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: cannot make this without club trick|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: They will have to rely on Yuvraj as usual|pg||
nt|sunit: though it will be difficult for her to accept the fact that is excellent lead was for a 10 imp drop|pg||

nt|offthebend: lets see what happpens on this one|pg||
nt|sunit: she got greedy it seems|pg||
nt|sunit: sometimes tricks are miscounted and which leads to such strange play, i think that might be the reason|pg||
nt|sga1: Last Board of this set coming up.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: 6S for N/S on ..any bets|pg||
nt|lestergold: how on earth did Venky pass his pard's takeout double in the open room?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes, they can't bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: can or cant Roland :)|pg||
nt|sunit: 2h here is heart and any other suit, 5/5 atleast less than a opening hand|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: no way unless they think they are saving against 6@h|pg||
nt|sga1: They may compete upto 5@s, not beyond.|pg||
nt|sunit: dont think 6spades will be bid on most tables|pg||
nt|sunit: india likely pick up 5 here|pg||
nt|sunit: dalal and gupta did well to stop in 3h on this board|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sunit: 4h can make when trumps are 3/2|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|sga1: 5@s is easy now.|pg||
nt|sunit: so finally india in the lead by 6 imps|pg||
nt|sga1: I think he gambled with no clear bis.|pg||
nt|sga1: bid.|pg||
mb|p!|mb|p|nt|sunit: club lead here|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind yopu not much in this n/s scoring 140 in this contract|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: good contract here sadly all finesses wrong|pg||
nt|sunit: and 4h has no chance|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ehsana: now with heart shotage with N obvious ...may be ;..........|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sga1: Good to be dbled in 5 when 6 makes.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he can sheepishly say that it was a stripe-tail Ape double:)|pg||
nt|ehsana: dont need to now..5S X..will give them enough  for te Bank|pg||
nt|sunit: so finally india 54 up after 4 sessions, 2more sessions reamin in this 96 board semi finals|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|sga1: That can be the case if he had dbled in direct seat.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ofourse:0|pg||

nt|sunit: and will get 3 more on board 14 , thx for the info Sridhar|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sga1: I also don't see any sense in Sunit's Take out after both have passed initially.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: spade to the ace, ruff a heart, pitch one on @DA and take the club finesse. 12 tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|sunit: nice game will make when hearts are 3/2 or dia 2/2, unlucky for syria|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c3|nt|suketbombi: why just club K in|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|sunit: there is a scoring error and india are up by 9 after the first session, second session will start at 5pm indian time|pg||
