nt|Vugraphu1: Schwartz studying|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|robinswr: 3nt would have been a better bid|pg||
nt|henryb: maybe bad methods|pg||
nt|henryb: Presumably Jones studying, unless the board is reversed?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Schwartz says that he thought 3@s showed extra values, balanced. Jones says that he thinks it was standard Jacoby and 3@s showed a spade splinter|pg||
nt|robinswr: this could allow them to make 6 if covered and lynch wins the 10|pg||
nt|henryb: ah, a dispute on methods|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: No it was Schwartz studying but on the basis of his belief about the 3@s bid, which was the way they had played at some time in the past|pg||
