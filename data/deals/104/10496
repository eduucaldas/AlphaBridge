mb|p|nt|Walddk2: U26 World Champions from Beijing|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mug: plenty of hands East can have that make 5@D from West's point of view|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: In this auction, yes|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|mtvesuvius: J@S into Q and give partner a 3rd @H instead of a @c|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps East should have waited a round to compete in diamonds with such a dull hand, NS had already found their fit|pg||
nt|mug: now he needs to find @SQ to escape for down one|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4 or 8 IMPs|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: he had a squeeze|pg||
nt|mug: he can't be sure South has @HAK|pg||
nt|sommer: well..same as guess|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: if he kept the 8@c in dummy and pitched 2@s|pg||
nt|sommer: he can't discard 2 @S' from table, exept, when he has decided N has the Q anyway|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|mtvesuvius: if the Q@S and @C guard are in the same hand there is a squeeze|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|sommer: 1 imp for Norway|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: anything South leads will set up or give declarer the chance to set up things|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last time Denmark were on vugraph from Romania, they were down by 40 in no time at all. Some of us hope that this won't happen again|pg||
nt|sommer: maybe|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: this should be a push|pg||
nt|mug: declarer has the rest now does he not?|pg||
nt|sommer: right|pg||

nt|mug: and @CQ falls|pg||
nt|sommer: yes|pg||
nt|mug: however he may play super safe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The difference between Denmark now and the team in Beijing is that the anchor pair, Schaltz-Houm√∏ller, are no longer available (too old)|pg||
nt|mug: I saw a hand yesterday when 6@H looked trivial but clubs were 5-0 and half the field went carelessly down |pg||
nt|mug: one declarer even failed in 4@H |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: was played in 7@H by the Germans|pg||

nt|mug: very unlucky|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ritong: the poor polish declarer was in 7@h and found 5/0 @cs offside to go down|pg||

nt|ritong: yeah yeah|pg||
nt|ritong: was dangerous that s all:)|pg||
nt|mug: interesting idea suggested to me that 5NT should be to play|pg||
nt|ritong: hm|pg||
nt|mug: but it is normally played as a grand slam try|pg||
nt|ritong: west s hand is not limited|pg||
nt|ritong: east s**|pg||
nt|mug: if they played it as to play he'd have bid it by now|pg||
nt|sommer: W shouldn't be captain after 1NT..never|pg||

mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ukdorj: West is in panic but 6@c is not helping|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|ritong: west might consider it:)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: the real trick is avoiding the grand :)|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|mug: that's the problem|pg||
nt|ukdorj: 6@s is no problem but can they avoid grandslam?|pg||
nt|ukdorj: :-)|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, EW must find out @DQ is missing|pg||
nt|mug: first East needs to show his void|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: 3@S is max 1@H|pg||
nt|sommer: ..W may think, p misbid:)|pg||
nt|ukdorj: are you sure?|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|mb|4D!|nt|sommer: ..not sure, but I THINK so|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: I think so also|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|mug: 3@S shows extras with heart shortage, in some systems at least|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|sommer: minimum with singleton (or void) @H|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: they play a Swedish 2NT I think...|pg||
nt|mug: now mb East can show the void in response to BW|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Minimums go through 3@c|pg||
nt|mug: but there was a danger a six-level response could be too high|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|mug: so West is still trying for the grand|pg||
mb|6H|nt|mug: no idea now what the earlier bids meant to be honest|pg||
nt|ritong: weird|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: I don't remember the universal name of the convention, but in DK it's called Bekkasin|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|mug: clearly West knows about the heart void|pg||
nt|ukdorj: No I think they play Jacoll|pg||
nt|sommer: ..sic...@DQ is missing:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ukdorj: 2NT maybe not GF|pg||
nt|sommer: ok|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: in theory we hope he doesn't :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2NT is Invitational+|pg||
nt|mug: well the important thing is they understood what they were doing, even if we didn't :)|pg||
nt|ritong: right|pg||
nt|tdrijverrr: i dont|pg||
nt|ritong: too bad..|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: I think I understood the auction|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: but of course I may be wrong :)|pg||
nt|tdrijverrr: pls explain :-)|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|ukdorj: 6@c was showing @cK and 6@H showed - but where @h void was shown I dodnt know|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|ritong: since west tried for the grand with one key off, it was somewhere for sure|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ukdorj: I think West would bid 6@d if 3rd round @d control|pg||
nt|sommer: I'm told, that 3@S showed @Hvoid according to Jacoll|pg||
nt|ukdorj: ok|pg||
nt|ritong: here we see that double by the opener either shows "support" or an unbiddable good hand|pg||
nt|ukdorj: then every thing makes sense|pg||
nt|sommer: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: the consequence being: avoid to leap to game with 5|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mug: but perhaps 2NT is scramble?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3NT +4 was a nice score though... everything just fell into place|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: 3@s is invitational with 5|pg||

pc|h3|nt|tdrijverrr: and meanwhile showing the harts|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT marginal better - both need @DK in S, but 3NT makes also when S has @dKxxx |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: this could have been down in a number of ways if 1 card is switched|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Such as this layout, where North has only xx@h|pg||
nt|ukdorj: and 5@d is down if North has 2@h or declarer trumph with high @d|pg||
nt|ritong: fortunately, we have to deal with the actual layout|pg||
nt|athene: playing the X as support OR strong hand is overloading it a bit maybe |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: then a trump promotion to beat|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: it might be playable but this auction shows how it can make things tricky - east didn't want to bid 2nt in case his partner had a minimum hand with 3 spades, when 3@S might be much ...|pg||
nt|athene: better|pg||

nt|mug: do you need a backer?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5N|nt|ukdorj: but the reason for 41S is probably that East is missing a control in one of the minors and that is all west got|pg||
