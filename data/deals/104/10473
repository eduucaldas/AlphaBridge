mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1N|nt|athene: it might look at first as though NS have @HKQ, @CA to take against 5@S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: but east can get hearts away on clubs|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: there's a Morton's Fork - east simply leads a club from hand; if South ducks, he doesn't get his @CA, but if he jumps in with it, North doesn't get a heart trick|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|athene: NS do have lots of HCP - it was hard for them not to double at the 5-level|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: often in these situations (when declarer leads a singleton towards KQ) it's best to duck the ace|pg||
nt|athene: because even though you lose your ace, you hold declarer to one winner, not two, in the suit|pg||
nt|athene: but here, with the @CJ falling, declarer could still come to twelve tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzts: S is still thinking|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. club to @CK wins; then declarer could ruff a club and then lead the @CQ, throwing a heart, pinning the @CJ and setting up the @C10 for a discard of the second heart|pg||
nt|athene: the red aces and a diamond ruff provide lots of nice entries to dummy to do all this|pg||

mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: if north leads a trump, that might let the contract make|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps 3@C was asking, 3@H told @H+@C, 4@C set trumps and after 2 cue bids, West launched RKC|pg||
nt|athene: but a trump is usually a bad lead against a small slam|pg||
nt|athene: ah yes south is on lead :)|pg||
nt|athene: well a trump from south *definitely* will make life easier for declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzts: this is one of the slowest hands i've seen in this tourney|pg||
nt|athene: even just the @C10 would make this a lot better|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: it looks normal to play @HAK and another heart right away, i think|pg||
nt|athene: you hope they are 3-3 or north has the shortage|pg||
