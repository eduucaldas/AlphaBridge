nt|vugraphzts: Tough duck|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think Bessis steals a trick or 2 on that defense|pg||

pc|c9|nt|poohbear: Declarer is short a trick. So u may be right Minnie|pg||
nt|poohbear: He has to guess the ending|pg||
nt|vugraphzts: Decl cannot cash all of his @Cs, since dummy will be squeezed|pg||

nt|minnie lee: he's must have a clue with all those @d discards|pg||

nt|poohbear: Ironically I am listening to UNDER PRESSURE by Queen :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzts: lol|pg||
nt|poohbear: So there is a suggestion that Dummy pitch a @s and try @ds hoping to guess the endplay if one hand holds 3@ds|pg||

nt|yuval10: defense did all they can to make declarer go wrong|pg||
nt|poohbear: only 3 left in the opps hand|pg||
