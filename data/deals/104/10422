nt|gff: kl|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Good morning from Las Vegas, Nevada for this semi-final match for USA 1 Seniors.   |pg||
nt|brolucius: We have some big names to watch in this room. That's good. |pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: hi David, thanks for joining us from all across the pond!|pg||
nt|brolucius: The first board does not look like it will cause much excitement, but we can hope for better things along the way.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: table discussing treatments vs other pairs unusual stuff|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Please welcome Gene Freed who will join us in today's commentary|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am asked what age qualifies one to be a senior. It used to be 55, which was much too young. They then decided to move it towards 60 by one year each year. No idea what we have ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: got to so far.|pg||
nt|gff: hI|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: somewhere around 60...|pg||
nt|mittmouse: hi all|pg||
mb|1D|an|precision, may be short|nt|brolucius: Since the average age of registered bridge players in the USA is around 68, it seems that 60 is still a bit low.|pg||
