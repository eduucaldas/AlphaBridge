mb|p|nt|ady: distributional 2 club opening    likely no other strong opening 2|pg||
nt|ady: hi Mike    Ralf|pg||

pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: well done West to play the @D8|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mmmakela: there used to be a rule that the strongest opening can't have a weak option right?|pg||
nt|ady: declarer liekly to get diamond position wrong on the lead|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|raghavan: Should play D A or K|pg||
nt|raghavan: East is trying to enter W to get club |pg||
nt|raghavan: So sure it is E has C A and Q|pg||
nt|ady: North is short  of tricks    may feel the need to finesse 10@D|pg||
nt|ady: if he takes this finesse can make with an end play on east|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ha and CAQ are with E so take 3 Spades and 2 Diamonds - let us see what E will throw- anyhow may end 1 down |pg||
nt|ady: only problem is dedclarer may be squeezed before east if he cashed the diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: cashes|pg||

nt|suketbombi: the score indeed is 1100 on last bd corrected now|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: around 11 tricks in hearts for n/s|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|1S|nt|raghavan: w may bid 3S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5@c for EW. Will they find it?|pg||
nt|april7: after a weak jump by S,EW will rshould rech the 5@C cntract|pg||
mb|2H|nt|andyv:  N is wondering if everyone has 10hcp|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ralfwil: For me it looks like a @d lead is the onlyway to make|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: declarer should have played a low diamond at trick 2 and ruffed  and taken discard   if west had dducked the 2nd diamond would have gone down     a kib spooted this|pg||

nt|raghavan: If NT = 13-15|pg||
nt|ralfwil: WD EW!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: i'm not sure about that 3N...|pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: kind of gambling|pg||
nt|xenya: what do you think?|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2C+2D+ SA and a ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: Niels is known to be a "bidder" :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good evaluation by West with his three small hearts|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: common for 1M-2NT to show limit raise + |pg||
nt|raghavan: well bid without much fuss|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that is, a raise to 3M or better|pg||
nt|ady: seems 2NT here is a limit raise or better |pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|xenya: both N and E are it seems|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I kind of like it so pass?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Mike from Uk here hi Vladimir hi Makela|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|suketbombi: six@S a good contract wud be push here|pg||
nt|lestergold: this could go well if declarer runsthe 9 of dims now|pg||
nt|ady: will need to establish a diamond trick for the 8th|pg||
nt|raghavan: correctly stopped in 2NT = 3S+3H+2C |pg||
nt|raghavan: Hi Mike - gald to work with you again'|pg||
nt|ady: will eventually lose 1 daimond trick in addition|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or find @hAx|pg||
pc|sA|nt|raghavan: e Ave, lead that . since declarere may have singleton K in that suit|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|lestergold: presumably the dim play is completely marked by the bidding and lack of lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@h would have been a decent save|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|april7: W will discard 2 @S on KQ of @D and ruff a @H in dumy|pg||
pc|s4|pc|dT|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|xenya: E just might have passed over N's pass, but i think he would have raised all the same|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|nt|lestergold: has blocked the hearts even if he reaqds position which is with the odds|pg||

nt|ady: part score hand    lijkely 1NT e/w|pg||
nt|ralfwil: happy to find @sA on side|pg||
nt|april7: but the way the defnce was he didn't need it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score hand |pg||
nt|xenya: missed that somehow|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lestergold: e/w cold for heart game!|pg||
nt|lestergold: but hard to reqach|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after @hQ he must have bad thoughts about @sA|pg||
nt|april7: 1NT by N and E will X and then we will see|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: diamond contract for e/w looks best|pg||
nt|xenya: we know what 2@C means!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|xenya: @Ds or a strong hand, i've been told|pg||
nt|april7: XX = @C?|pg||
nt|andyv:  south will bail out in @cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: Mike is it allowed to have a weak option in 2 @C strong in UK?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: awkward for North over 1NT|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: unless he has a natural 2@D available....|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: not that 2@D is likely to be much of a success|pg||
mb|2D!|an|FG checkback|nt|suketbombi: lead down to 41 imps here but then there is a 1100 on bd 32|pg||
nt|raghavan: May lead C|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think so|pg||
nt|mdgraham: redouble can be used as a puppet to 2@C, in order to play in 2 of a minor |pg||
nt|april7: if its not forcing , W should pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which allows 2@C to be stayman, as other bids as system on |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: no-trump opening kept e/w out of bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: wello best defence will see this about 2 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: but e/w can make a dim contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: not normally|pg||
nt|mmmakela: neither in Finland|pg||
mb|3C|nt|suketbombi: 47|pg||
nt|raghavan: Invitation which W will refuse |pg||
nt|ady: n/s  better in spades    but south has no good reason to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: yet as cards lie 5 frigid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt on W, but they will find their 4-4 in @h?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but a quiet finish to the auction|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's surprising|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: this can go down 3 on best defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: cash in right order maybe 3 off with a trump promoted|pg||
nt|xenya: who is to blame here, if anyone?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: must admit I wd've bid 4 as E|pg||
nt|lestergold: no one|pg||
nt|april7: but only 2 @D are in|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Ca and High C|pg||
mb|3S|nt|suketbombi: sorry even now it is 59 too many diartractions here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: with 1oo on bd 32 the match seems to be over |pg||
nt|suketbombi: 1100|pg||
nt|xenya: my opinion also|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|april7: and not even that, no entry to dummy|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|don paulus: benefit of preempts|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|lestergold: after heart ruff dims cashed then ace and another club will do it|pg||
nt|raghavan: N may try to get 2 or 3 ruffs with small Diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: yes    might restrick to down 2    which will be no loss as e/w likely to maked 8 or 9 tricks in no-trumps|pg||
pc|h7|nt|raghavan: what a defense!!|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h5|nt|raghavan: 4th H declarer should ruff with Dj, ruff club etc |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ralfwil: looks like -1|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|raghavan: Trump promotion S10?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: shoudl hav cashed dims first but i still think its 3 off|pg||
nt|ady: east best to play Q@D|pg||
nt|raghavan: West should have played D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence has gone slightly astray, not playing a trump|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes I think West had the chance- probably holding to his 10 to 4 trumps|pg||
nt|ady: if east plays another club  and north plays 4th hearft   east can discard a spade    so still down 2|pg||
nt|raghavan: East may lead  club K? we do not know |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Knut Blakset|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: the game is a perfecto |pg||
nt|don paulus: this system was quite popular in B - Holland - 2 @c as weak @d or SF|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: it seems should be down 2  whichever|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Lars in the West seat is Knut's brother|pg||
nt|ady: hi Knut|pg||
nt|raghavan: WC Knot Blakset|pg||
nt|wolwerine: Hi evrybody|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|pelu: why dont u allowe a weak option in 2@C? - lets say why not a strong opyion : 2@c = weak @D or strong|pg||
nt|don paulus: nowadays more often 2@c weak with both majors - or SF|pg||
nt|raghavan: enter in H and throw S on CQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: few would reach it east's hnad is full o bholes how does he know that west'shand fits so perc|pg||
nt|xenya: low preempts, mind you -- if N hada been more active, he may have pushed EW to 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: fectly the q club is enormous|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: I now have cc for NS -- same as Graversen played in SanRemo -- 2@c is eighter strong or weak @d|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 1NT may be tight on a low diamond lead  |pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: except Diamonds - others are unevenly distributed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no real reaosn to go up with the @DQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I rather want to go -1 in 3nt than in 2@d on EW...|pg||
mb|1N|nt|april7: 4@S to be made with Q of @H as entry to @S finesse|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h by W on last hand looked to have a lot of play|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: multi from west|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anyway, we will see|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   need to avoid getting too high|pg||
mb|2D!|an|transfer|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: heading for 4@H|pg||
nt|april7: E is endplayed on lead|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: n/s cold for 4s but e/w only one off in 5c|pg||
nt|mmmakela: this looks interesting|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|wolwerine: 3 D should cool East down|pg||
mb|3N|nt|don paulus: repeat @h now ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Colleagues Can anyone tell us about the players - their standing in their country etc|pg||
nt|april7: best lead though not t:)o be found is Q of @C|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: this sequence guarantees that east does not have heart support|pg||
nt|raghavan: Don it is not repeating - going all the way to game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh well, so much for that prediction|pg||
nt|ady: South has some good defense with partner in the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: borderline double from south 2nd time round    shows hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: a vulnerable effort with that ropey spade suit 3h i think a level too high|pg||
nt|ady: this finesse would help|pg||
nt|wolwerine: As you can see NS play a light style with overcalls|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: it served itsb purpose pushing n/s probably too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3h a rather unsound back in|pg||
nt|lestergold: could have been humungously horrid east could have an even better hand with a spade misfit|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: both pairs play in the first division in Denmark - and have all 4 been playing for Denmark|pg||
nt|raghavan: Thanks Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: NS has especially been very good in pairs tournaments|pg||
nt|ady: no doubt the 9@S  will later be finessed|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  or small @c and @h switch|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  still down 1 |pg||
pc|c7|nt|raghavan: Jan can u tell us what system they play - I know weak NT + what?|pg||
nt|lestergold: south er likes it too much|pg||

pc|hA|nt|lestergold: well i am commentating on vulnerable teams b idding and this hand has not been an impressive display in my opinion|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer X on the first round showing @h. After that itÂ´s up to N to  act. Also to be able to D 2@s for penalty|pg||
nt|lestergold: ouch|pg||
nt|mdgraham: needs to go to @S9 to take the diamond hook  |pg||
nt|april7: 10 tricks always|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|ady: possibly down 3 |pg||
nt|lestergold: 300 against zip not good bridge|pg||

nt|lestergold: but playing qd first would still guarantee 9 tricks i suppose its whether you think the odds of a stuiff dim ace are high|pg||

nt|wolwerine: 7@H looks wrong. Why not 6@D? That must ask for @CQ|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Maybe RÃ¸n could have investigated after 6@C. Plenty of room. I agree with Knut|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|xenya: they will beat it i think, but probably not enough to make up for a vulnerable game|pg||

mb|r|nt|raghavan: Knut - your brother is really aggressive - worth it|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Interesting from EW point of view|pg||
nt|lestergold: a couple of round of trumps and the children will have to be asked to leave the room|pg||

mb|d|nt|Vugraphu2: Guess we need trays that aren't green, so the pass cards show up better :)|pg||
nt|jimkrek: there is a choice of 1nt or 2hrts here-i prefer 1nt|pg||
nt|robinswr: looks like ns can make 7spades |pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am currently doing a research project about leading out long suits. the premise is that you lead from the top down when you want opps to discrad from the higher ranking suit, and ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: from the bottom up when you want them to throw the lowest suit. the project is well funded, but i do need more drugs :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jimkrek: they will do well to reach 6|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|jimkrek: looks like 3 or 4-probably only 3 because they got the tap going|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has 7 LTC, no real rebid problems, some defense, and playability in 3 suits including both majors. for some of us, that adds up to an opening bid, especially nonvul|pg||

nt|xenya: how commanding is it, Markku?|pg||
nt|wolwerine: Then South can force with a diamond so only 9 tricks|pg||

nt|mdgraham: the OR is about to start the 7@H hand - bet it's flat    |pg||
nt|wolwerine: Bet taken - I think they stop in six|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: agreed also with J1098 in spades and 3Kings - he should double|pg||
nt|andyv:  I hope it's a small wager, Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 59-17 1st qtr|pg||
nt|xenya: impressive, but there are 5 more|pg||
nt|raghavan: Is 2c is strong?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT e/w   seems likely      |pg||
nt|raghavan: likely 3NT by EW|pg||
mb|1D|nt|wolwerine: Yes 2@C is strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: quarters i mean |pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Who says that there are 2 tricks in @d for the defence?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andyv:  the Barry Crane rule about bidding 7 in team games would have been a useful tool for E/W:)|pg||
nt|wolwerine: What did he say? Never bid seven|pg||
nt|andyv:  yeap|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: 3nt by NS but unlikely to be there 4@H dn 1  seems to normal|pg||
nt|mmmakela: sure maybe "commanding" was an overbid|pg||
nt|wolwerine: Ligner 500|pg||
nt|wolwerine: Looks like 500|pg||
nt|andyv:  not just say it, he was adament about it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3N should make as south has no entry to his diamonds and spades lie well for declarer|pg||

nt|lestergold: off of course if he doesnt duck bbut h ewill|pg||

pc|c8|pc|cT|nt|wolwerine: Only one useful card in dummy - @H8!|pg||
nt|raghavan: can use it now to ruff and lead C|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|xenya: normal contract that should go down|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok Mike, you win!|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|suketbombi:  ill timed sacrifice by Sunit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS will make 400 or so in 3NT though|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 500    against about 460 for 3nr by n/s|pg||
nt|raghavan: agreed but 3 IMP goes away from EW|pg||
nt|wolwerine: 3 NT with a heart lead is in trouble|pg||
pc|s3|nt|raghavan: Clubs are not running|pg||
nt|raghavan: going 1 down - 1C+3D+1S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: can give a club up |pg||

nt|mmmakela: bet didn't happen|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: as cards lie there appear to be only 8 tricks but in the end game north will have to give the 9th trick|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: just take the trump finesse|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|wolwerine: Good for the match|pg||
nt|andyv:  true|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: This is a typical hand to play @c from the top.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: @H7 may come into play, particularly if EW play MUD |pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: but in a way it is psychologically more acceptable to take the penalty |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|raghavan: spade 6|pg||
nt|ady: may sqeeze himself here|pg||
nt|lestergold: the spade in the bag this makes surely|pg||
nt|ady: this should go down now if south cashes a diamond and plaays a hea|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence can only get a club a dim and the spade ace now|pg||
nt|ady: south can play a heart|pg||
nt|xenya: back to down |pg||
nt|ady: well if east does not bid  there may well not be a heart lead and if he leads the 8 the suit wont run for the defenders   and if he leads low  the suit might get blocked|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: e/w have 5 tricks 3 cluibs to come and the KH how does it go down?|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: needs to be pushed though|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 2D seems available|pg||
nt|robinswr: i would bid 1spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|fallenius: here west may get proppelled into slam , with more luck than control|pg||
nt|jimkrek: it was suggested to me by gene saxe that if he was going to bid 6s maybe he cd bid 5 hearts-then 6s...passell might go..to 7|pg||
nt|drewsky: IN the real world, lefty bid 4@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: oh sorry, steve, thought you were addressing my comments about opening the bidding. i would also overcall 1S and double later|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all true, but how much can S reasonably hope for from a passe dhand|pg||
nt|drewsky: partner might think you are more like 6-1-3-3 or just a good hand with spades|pg||
nt|robinswr: schwartz has done many things that i havn't agreed with|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N is allowed to open the bidding in his partnership (as recommended by this shop), much easier|pg||
nt|drewsky: you will end up plauigna 5-2 fit instead of a 5-4 fit in a minor|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Now they are discussing richie's shape on previous board, richie says 5332, mike says 5422 pulls out last board and richie concedes|pg||
