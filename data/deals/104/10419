nt|ahollan1: when would it be wrong to try @C9?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=10-15 HCP, (a) 6+@C, 1-suit  (b) 4+@C and 5+@S|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 2@c = NAT (they play Ultimate Club)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pab1: seems like an unlikely pass by NOrth|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drew wants a recount|pg||
nt|pab1: same number of tricks, even if Club 9 is covered|pg||
mb|1S|nt|robinswr: akxxx/xx/xx/AJxx they open 2clubs|pg||
nt|imp_jan: or 1n (as in the first quarter) ;)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL=PUP 2@D, (a) @D (b) 5+@H & 3+@S|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2S|nt|pab1: also odd, that Grqanovetter didn't overcall 1NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm  i wonder if they flipped the board direction|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: I think my board doesn't match their auction, yikes!|pg||
nt|pab1: director, please!|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: figured it out...they are playing  39|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another hand for my never-to-be-finished book "What's Going On?"|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: what do you think of 1NT as opposed to dbl , Peter?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: if one table isn't enough -- http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   then one window per room|pg||
nt|pab1: Same play Sandwich NT, for takeout, but you get stolen from too often, IMHO|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|poohbear: I like 1NT even though there is no @c stop. Gets the strength across and the pattern|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: if telling the truth - NS play standard signals|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pab1: i would have doubled, with 4-4 in reds|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C3 probably didn't really force the @CQ|pg||
nt|pab1: double seems pretty normal|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|d8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|pab1: However, 1NT probably makes the auction easier for partner|pg||
nt|pab1: I would make a negative double with Ekeblad's hand -- not wanting to sell out with a singleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: making it easier for partner - is that allowed?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|d9|pg||
nt|poohbear: I agree  but on this hand it doesnt work out well unless partner makes an  " enlightened " pass|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easier for East to be enlightened if his partner showed hand via DBL instead of 1N - but still probably not enough to get into auction|pg||
mc|8|nt|Vugraphu5: table taking a smoke break|pg||
nt|pab1: seems he would have gone down down without Heart Ace cash, no?|pg||
nt|poohbear: yea|pg||

nt|Vugraphu5: that is what happened....|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Eke saying low diamonds showed club interest.   Gran says we don't play Lavinthal|pg||
nt|pab1: guess he was playing declarer for QJx of CLubs and no Heart King|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the Open Trials   Granovetter played with Ron Rubin, Ekeblad played with Peter Weicshel|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Gran:  let's discuss the hands over Chivas Regal.   Eke:  maybe we should have the Chivas now|pg||

mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: EW play Ultimate Canape - expect a lot of alerts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if things settle down, you can watch multiple tables using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   [one window per room]|pg||

pc|d5|nt|pab1: Drewski helped his partner lead, but it didn't matter|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Drewski: what is your definition of 14+.   Eke:  a couple of 109's,  a five card suit.  we don't psyche 1N we try to play bridge.  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Granovetter helped us by transferring to Ekeblad [Russ plays faster than Matt]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if win @D and shift to @C - time to setup @S for @C pitch|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Drewski:  sorry|pg||
nt|poohbear: Drew will probably switch to a @c hoping declarer has the @d Q instead of the @s Q|pg||
nt|pab1: drew may be thinking about underleading second round of Diamonds, for a Spade through.|pg||
nt|poohbear: or might just go passive|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|imp_jan: diamond lead..|pg||
nt|imp_jan: Ron Smith bid lead directing :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3nt will not make but they do have a 9-card club fit which if clubs were 2-2 would make 5clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will Ron Smith try @S or @D2?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: of course he leads diamonds|pg||
nt|robinswr: his partner did not bid a major so why wouldn't he lead a diamond|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are we sure we know that 2@C was absolutely @H & @S?|pg||
nt|robinswr: but opening leads are difficult|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then again - it sounds like Granovetter holds @H & @S also -- so that should help find @D|pg||
nt|imp_jan: does ron knows he is on lead?|pg||
nt|reisig: Ron ALWAYS knows :)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: ok, so then we have to wait a littlbit longer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Matt's table finished almost 5 boards ahead of other room in Q1 -- maybe Ron trying to slow things down :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: nothing to be ashamed of|pg||
nt|poohbear: might have game in @Hs @ss or NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I would open 1@S before I passed 1@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Drew:  you opened a 10 count  (joking about @CK)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Drew and Eke are having an extended critique of Onstott's bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially If 1@D-1@H;1@S shows unbal hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: are they both trashing him?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Drew approves,  Eke doesn't.   |pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Drew:  pass = 100% in my book|pg||
nt|pab1: 4 Spades looks like it might depend on the lead|pg||
nt|poohbear: Drew ALWAYS sticks up for his partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right -- especially at the table!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|imp_jan: the moe south thinks the less like he is to lead a diamond|pg||

nt|ahollan1: partner uber alles|pg||

pc|h2|nt|imp_jan: so @H4 is Smith?|pg||

nt|robinswr: if smith is playing smith he should have played the 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right Jan |pg||
nt|robinswr: if he is playing reverse smith then he should have played the 2|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: system summary just says "smith echo"|pg||
pc|h6|nt|imp_jan: so we may conclude that Smith is not at stake here|pg||
nt|imp_jan: ohw|pg||
nt|robinswr: when you signal you should always signal with the highest card you can afford (but don't blow a trick signaling)|pg||
nt|stew: i too would rebid 1s  too many options H, S, NT 4S may even make on heartQ lead or D 10|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: so the issue here - did Ron think he could NOT afford the @H9|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: best from kibitzer might have been  1@C-(2@S)-4N|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|imp_jan: mini third hand canapé here by russ|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 3rd seat -- Ekeblad operating |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: rdbl|pg||
nt|imp_jan: dangerous dbl by mat|pg||
nt|stew: tricky|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: 3NT has chances on a non @h lead. 5@d might be a stretch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another benefit of checkback -- 1@S rebid can confirm 4+@D [some say 1@S guarantees unbal hand]|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pab1: tough choice for South.  Clubs well stopped for 3NT, but no apparent source of nine tricks|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3nt would boil down to guessing the @cs for 3 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Drewski:  good luck, I hope I have enough for you|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: wow -- what a gamble that could have been|pg||
nt|imp_jan: what???|pg||
nt|imp_jan: typo?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: that is better|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|imp_jan: operator is 4@D really passed around?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|h7|nt|imp_jan: the hand is now easy to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even 12 tricks possible|pg||
nt|imp_jan: with a heart lead there is the danger of getting trumpshort|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Smith has to worry about exactly which Ekeblad psych |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|stew: trump back?|pg||
nt|pab1: might come home on a complete cross ruff, if no trump shift now|pg||
nt|poohbear: the curse of Scotland might prevent 11 tricks now on a trump back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose 1st 2 tricks could have Granovetter original holding @CJ872  [3rd even/low odd] -- can Ostott account for that possibility?|pg||
nt|stew: yes  must shift to a trump else 11 tricks|pg||
nt|poohbear: curse of Scotland ( 9@d)|pg||
nt|poohbear: if West plays a plain card it helps declarer get 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|poohbear: Ace of @hs was an important entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D has Curse of Scotland and The Beer Card, @S has Big & Little Casino -- what about the poor round suit spots??|pg||
nt|stew: hooking the club isn't any good .. it get's you the club trick, but you must draw 3 rounds of trump for it to survive and then you just dan't get to 11|pg||
nt|poohbear: on a non trump return Declarer will pitch a @c on the spade and cross ruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Gran: sorry.  Drew:  I am sure we have plenty of time|pg||
nt|pab1: One entry short, to dummy, if a trump is led now.|pg||
nt|stew: nothing is going anywhere.  100% he will shift to a trump|pg||
nt|poohbear: It was sort of a non play to play a @h to lead a @s down since if the ace is onside there would be a @c ruff. Though it is possible that the long @cs were with the opening leader|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Gran is leaning sideways in his chair, knit eyebrows,  hand on chin|pg||
nt|pab1: If 8 and 6 of Diamonds were switched, the 7 of Diamonds would provide the needed entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how can you tell if he still has a chin?|pg||
nt|poohbear: dont see how that works Peter|pg||
mc|11|nt|imp_jan: spades finessable now|pg||
nt|poohbear: ok I see. Could play the 7 now|pg||

nt|Vugraphu5: Drewski,  I could of had more for you.   Onstott:  I could of made it|pg||
mb|2N|nt|stew: aha 6H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D-1@S;1N- some form of checkback|pg||
nt|imp_jan: probaslbly checkback now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok 1@C instead of 1@D|pg||
nt|poohbear: 6 NT looks better |pg||
mb|3C|nt|poohbear: 6@c might be best|pg||
nt|pab1: Three slams make, but might be heard to reach.  Only 29 HCP|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|stew: true might make without heart suit (on a good day)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S is one of few non-alertable opening bids for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i read too many menagerie books -- Hideous Hog always opened WEAKER minor :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|poohbear: get there now I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|stew: let's see|pg||
nt|pab1: time for RKC.  Oops|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H???|pg||
nt|stew: this match may have tightened up!|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: was that forcing in the old days?|pg||
nt|pab1: 4-1 Clubs would frequently beat 6H, but not this time.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: some play it as forcing|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|imp_jan: though i wld have preferred 2@c checkback|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: that is a hefty non-forcing 2@H|pg||

nt|pab1: I think the potential gains are for Schwartz|pg||
nt|poohbear: last set scheduled in 25 min |pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: that will be tough comparison to justify - maybe if they say they stopped in 3@S|pg||
nt|pab1: 5D down one, and 4H making 6|pg||
mb|d|nt|poohbear: excellent 5@c here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great job from our operator JoAnna Stansby!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i'd like to thank the gods for stable connectivity|pg||
nt|stew: woops  so mush for that tight comment.  Hard to think of Drewski not playing with Richie|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: I have the easy part.   this was fun, and I will be back for last set|pg||
nt|poohbear: Lets see what Drewski rebids|pg||
mb|3S|nt|imp_jan: i sympathize with the overcall on a four card here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just a thought -- i wonder if 1minor-2@H = weak 5@S 4+@H  - then this sequence was more constructive than we imagined|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sorry 1@D=10-15, 0+@D |pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: 1@S by north is allowed being 4crds only... not according to gaylor's book apparently|pg||
nt|pab1: Yes, excellent operating by Joanna, with helpful quotes from the players|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu5: I left out the unprintable ones....|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: sort of a family show you know|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the losers don't go home -- they get into bracket to contend for USA2 berth|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|h3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: one of hands for 1@D is canape with 5+@S -- maybe Kasle thought of that -- or just didn't like non-forcing bid in 4 card suit|pg||
pc|d7|nt|poohbear: 5@c needs either 2-2 trumps with @h no worse than 4-2  or 3-3 @h with trumps no worse than 3-1|pg||
pc|c4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|imp_jan: looks like a make now|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: board 28 interesting 14 imp swing|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pab1: and another potential gain for Schwartz|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|imp_jan: yes indeed|pg||
nt|poohbear: Dont think 5@c makes|pg||
pc|c8|nt|imp_jan: and we were discussing the overtrick in 5@C :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: no good break in either key suit|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: 30 more boards to play today -- next set scheduled [keyword] to begin in about 1 hour 40 minutes|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mittmouse: interesting if declarer had the 6 of h that suit plays naturally for 3 tricks|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: thanks to our very patient operator Dan Wolkowitz|pg||
pc|h2|nt|poohbear: sorry dreaming here:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: thanks all,  I will leave the table open, since other room still playing, |pg||
nt|pab1: thanks, all|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5@c just needs no worse than 4-2 @h|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: hope to see you later, bye|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||

nt|imp_jan: still 2 x 15 to come|pg||
nt|imp_jan: pleasure is mine pal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and thanks to all the kibitzers for insight, giggles and keeping us honest|pg||
