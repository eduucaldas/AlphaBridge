nt|cuttysark: Not very well judged by South, I fear|pg||
nt|babydolldk: No Dorthe is going for 300|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm east fairly content with this i imagine|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think he should bid 2NT as a sort of scramble - you pick a suit partner - to reach 3C|pg||

nt|xenya: very well done by both pairs anyway|pg||
nt|babydolldk: maybe it depends on how many opening 3@C in S....|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cuttysark: East has certainly had his share of spades in these 3 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It must be a strong field when a pair like Sabine and Jens Auken did not qualify for the finals|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Great defence - perhaps East should not have ducked the spade, but his goose was already cooked|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I suspect N-S got most of the lost points on board 1 back on boards 2 and 3|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|babydolldk: I agree|pg||
nt|xenya: boards 2 and 3 might more than make up for the disaster on board 1 -- for NS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, this is not Peter Lund, our dear fellow commentator. Peter was knocked out in the semi-final|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: Next round -- NS is Knut Blakset and Grethe Skafte ... EW is Claus Lund and Thomas Egedgaard|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I guess there is more than one Lund in Denmark...|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|xenya: 11 tricks in both contracts|pg||
nt|roswolf: when pard doubles for penalty you should pass with the east hand unless you are red v green|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Top per board +19, bottom -19, average 0|pg||
nt|roswolf: since otherwise you will hardly penalise opps at all|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|d7|pc|h4|pg||

nt|xenya: i don't think this auction will be duplicated at many tables|pg||
nt|roswolf: of course|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can't agree there, Geoffrey - if you have no described your hand very well partner cannot judge what to do|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Here East's double probably showed values - but not a singleton heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, but West's double showed 4|pg||

nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h5|nt|cuttysark: Good hand for 2over1F2NT - West can rebid 2@S first|pg||
