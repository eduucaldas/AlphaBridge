mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu1: Berk explained to Russ that 2@d showed extra diamond length (I think - know he explained something)|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: Berk and lair switched seats for this set?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: of course Lair doesn't know that his partner was kidding, so he will probably bid 3@D|pg||
nt|kit: This gives Ekeblad another badly needed chance|pg||

nt|kit: not closed room auction -- South opened 2@H, 2@S overcall, and North took creepy-crawlie approach of 3@H (and then 4@h over 3@S)|pg||

mb|2C|mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: 2@D is NF|pg||

nt|ahollan1: even if NF   do you expect 2@D to end the auction with that monster?|pg||

pc|sK|nt|kastan88: what to think with South hand, if partner saying, I have lot of heart tricks? So probably double was something, or South knowing partner doubling sometimes without tricks :)|pg||
nt|vasanti: young blood wants to draw blood:)|pg||

nt|asig: Even 5@h is a good save :)|pg||

nt|kastan88: North putting partne under pressure: why she is doubling without trump tricks?|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Berk: "I could have bid 3@c, I lose 2 spades, 2 hearts, 2 clubs ..." Lair: "I could have beaten it with a diamond out and a heart back"|pg||
nt|kit: two balanced hands, two distributional hands.  Let's see who bids the most.|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: We're still waiting for Russ to get back from his smoke break - now he's here|pg||
nt|lc: 1@S  2@H  2@S,  then South drives to 4@H and E-W ...  we'll see.|pg||
nt|kit: West hand is good example of:  When you are void in their suit, bid one more than you think you should.|pg||
nt|lc: Also, when in doubt bid 4@S over 4@H|pg||

nt|kit: well, I would lead a spade before I would lead a heart|pg||

nt|kit: so I guess that makes it my third choice|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kit: I like my aces to capture their honors|pg||
nt|lc: I'd lead a @S before I'd guess a minor and watch declarer throw @S and have partner look at me with his @SKQJ10x and ask why I didn't lead one.|pg||

nt|petergill: 3NT = non-serious about slam, hence 4@S cue later, since 3NT had already said that his hand was poor, so 4@C was a most serious slam try indeed|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S = 1st or 2nd round spade control, denies 1st or 2nd round @D control due to bypassing 4@D, hence North needs to think now, knowing no @Da opposite|pg||
nt|hobakan: :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mtvesuvius: The leaders at the moment are 1. Norway with 101 VPs 2. Germany with 95 VPs 3. France with 91 VPs|pg||
nt|petergill: North decides slam is a finesse and trump break at best, i.e. less than the required 50% |pg||

nt|ahalim: wow|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: wow, well done|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Padon liked his club control and spots I bet|pg||
nt|petergill: Superficially, South might have passed 5@H, as the partnership might be off @DAK from South's point of view, but he takes the view that his hand could not be better and with no @DA ...|pg||
nt|petergill: nor @DK North would have bid 4@H not 4@C|pg||

pc|c6|nt|tomi2: bye|pg||

nt|ahollan1: how about if swap @SK with @Cx|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe then.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ: "I had sort of an intermediate jump overcall; I liked the lead; it was on the heart finesse; or a club onside"|pg||
nt|chip: I agree, decent defense and lots of losers.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 10-15 HCP, (a) 6+@C, 1-suit  (b) 4+@C and 5+@S|pg||
nt|chip: makes 4H unattractive.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|lc: Important to know now if X=@D or a good hand. Hope they discussed it.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|poohbear: 4@h with a chance to make in the closed room on 52 ( no @c shift)|pg||
nt|kit: now how does South know whether to choose clubs or spades on his hand?|pg||
nt|lc: West has both cases covered.|pg||
nt|chip: At least he has both.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlike Precision   this 2@D bid does NOT show any values|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Lair sort of alerted the DBL, but no questions|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Pass denies 5+@S hand|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kit: another good example of partnership agreements -- you have to have a general rule on doubles of artificial calls like this, and stick to it|pg||
nt|chip: Ours is it shows the suit, right?|pg||
nt|lc: We play it shows @D.|pg||
nt|kit: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: And now another double, this one takeout|pg||
nt|chip: Showing the suit is my default with Lew also.|pg||
nt|lc: What will Berk do if Lair doubles again?|pg||
nt|kit: And if East passes it, they just might take him out|pg||
nt|kit: well, 5 tricks are easier than 9, so .......|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Lair asks about 2@d. Granovetter won't write because it's now after sundown, so they get up and go away from the table and he explains, not quite loudly enough for me to hear|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: effectively  all hands without significant @C support  bid 2@D|pg||
nt|lc: Pass would get 500, it seems.|pg||
nt|kit: now that seems wrong -- means the other side knows that a bid is alerted and asked about|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ asks Berk if they have an agreement about the DBL of 2@d and he says not clear|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Easier to pass 3@C in a bidding contest than at the table where -670 is painful.|pg||
nt|kit: East's decision a big swing there|pg||
nt|lc: At least that's my defense of my partner.|pg||
nt|kit: simple LAW pass, right Larry?|pg||
nt|lc: You guys can all pile on and say that PASS was easy.  Yeah.|pg||
nt|chip: not a good hand for the NS system. No way for S to avoid playing a silly contract (way too high in 3C, but if he passes 2c, could be a 4-2 with a 5-3 spade fit).|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|kit: You gotta believe!|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lc: Esspecially if partner has @D, pass makes sense.  But David's (and my) philosophy is try not to be -670 and win the match on some other board.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: figure  2 opponents guessing but only 1 partner|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|chip: I think Pass was a good decision. Percentage, but could be wrong.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|nt|kit: my philosophy is a plus score is better than a minus score|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|chip: The 2C opening could have had 5S and 4 clubs (not a normal precision 2C).|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wish i'd used Kit's philosophy with stock market|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, but -670 not as good as + 140.|pg||
nt|kit: 2 of clubs a very bad idea here|pg||
nt|kit: if it occurs to declarer to stick in the 7, that extra trick might be the difference here.|pg||
nt|kit: playing the 7 of clubs is saying that Ekeblad made a bad play|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|kit: declarer probably okay anyway, as he is in overruffing position in both minors|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: but maybe not -- that 2 of spades might be too small to compete with South's spades|pg||
nt|poohbear: Grovesnor is a play where the opponent purposely gives you a winning option when he ddint have to. Strictly to mess with your head|pg||
nt|kit: certainly South needs to ruff -- can't let that 2 of spades score|pg||
nt|poohbear: I am may have the spelling wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter seems to have the little diamond ready to play|pg||
nt|poohbear: Grosvenor I am told|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: But he's still thinking about it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't believe it until you see it |pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|lc: East hand is actually easier to bid in Standard than in big @C.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: most players would play this 3@H bid is looking for a heart stopper, as it is.|pg||
nt|lc: This time, North had better lead his partner's suit to have any chance to beat 4@S|pg||

pc|c4|nt|kit: well, this time heart lead is pretty easy|pg||
nt|kit: or so I thought|pg||

pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: now Granovetter known to be on minimum overcall - especially for him -- maybe infer singleton @S?|pg||
nt|lc: Would Granovetter overcall with @HKJxxx  @CA and a flat hand VUL?|pg||
nt|lc: I sure would (the way my partner's lead).|pg||
nt|lc: But Granovetter is indeed sound.|pg||

nt|lc: Is BBO available in the restroom?|pg||

nt|lc: A good rule in today's electronic age.|pg||
nt|chip: maybe if you have an iphone or equivalent (why security on those is tight)|pg||
nt|lc: They actually don't screen or check.  It is on the "honor system."|pg||
nt|chip: But harsh penalties if caught.|pg||
nt|lc: Players wouldn't intentionally have a device, but they often forget to unload them and accidentally walk in with one in pocket.|pg||

nt|lc: Maybe opponents would give honest count in @D.  :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: even with computer -- my notes aren't neat|pg||

nt|lc: So, 3@S did show specifically @C shortness.  I guess Lair wasn't worried about being off @HAK.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Berk says that 3@d showed a minimum and 3@h asked and 3@s showed club shortness. Lair thought that 3@s showed balance with a little extra|pg||
nt|lc: Also, when no X of Artif 3@H, a @H lead is less likely.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: And now that I have looked at Berk's notes, I will admit that "neat" might have been a slight overbid, but 'tiny' wasn't|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|laurentiu: to be or not to be ... :)|pg||
