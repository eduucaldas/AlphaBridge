mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|kit: But West will surely accept the transfer, won't he?|pg||
nt|lc: This kept E-W out of 4@S.|pg||
nt|lc: I was wondering if Lair would bid 4@S.  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: last set  Ek's 1@H opener on 4 to the deuce found RHO with AQJ10xxx|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S down't seem to quite fetch on my quick analysis|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Berk: "if you have a longer suit can it be spades?" Russ: "if I have a longer suit it can be anything; if I have just hearts it's at least 5"|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chip: Note that he catches a pretty good dummy and still wrong to bid.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: a good dummy would include the 9 of spades|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||

nt|kit: not closed room auction -- South opened 2@H, 2@S overcall, and North took creepy-crawlie approach of 3@H (and then 4@h over 3@S)|pg||
nt|lc: Yeah, but if you try to Google Canape to look it up, you will get food info.,|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: More discussion of 4@s ending with agreement that it's down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and popularized by Italian Blue Team in a couple of their systems|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|kit: had he bid 4@H immediately, he would have gotten his plus score against 4@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: well, this is true negative double for minors|pg||
nt|chip: Lair wanted to emphasize spades for the lead.|pg||
nt|lc: :)|pg||
nt|lc: How many @S now by Berk?|pg||
nt|kit: but somehow bidding 2@D looks more to the point to me|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe 2@D is NF in their system?|pg||
nt|chip: maybe 2D - NF?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D is NF|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|lc: Not easy to reach slam now.|pg||
nt|kit: this is a good illustration why negative free bids of a MINOR aren't a good idea|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|lc: No way Granovetter can raise this.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if NF   do you expect 2@D to end the auction with that monster?|pg||
nt|kit: This time he lucks out, as slam goes down on the stiff club lead -- but that is just luck IMO|pg||
nt|lc: Actually, a @C lead would beat slam.|pg||
nt|chip: We now see that Russ got pushed into 5D. Maybe figures other side will have a good save.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter explaining to Lair that 2@d immediately over 1@s would have been NF|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|chip: See, Lair did get his spade lead.|pg||

mb|3H|nt|bily: i think|pg||

mb|p|nt|kastan88: double now is wrong without trump tricks and minimum, IMO, if this is not some artificial|pg||
nt|asig: Dbl is very ill advised as 2@h is unbeatable|pg||
nt|eerbil: 3nt neden açýlmadý merak ediyorum|pg||
nt|MolvaM: muhammet özgür rakiplere olasý bir 4 majör kontratý olduðundan þüpheleniyordu ama ortaðý gereðinden çok majör kart bulunduruyor elinde|pg||

nt|vasanti: looks like they not reaching game|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: That cannot be a winning bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 1NT would show about 18 with me,  so Robert is expecting miracles I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: what to think with South hand, if partner saying, I have lot of heart tricks? So probably double was something, or South knowing partner doubling sometimes without tricks :)|pg||
nt|vasanti: young blood wants to draw blood:)|pg||
nt|kastan88: even 3@H is good sacrifice, as 4@S stay and 3@H only 1 down|pg||
nt|vasanti: loke jaak says ill advised|pg||
nt|vasanti: like|pg||
nt|asig: Even 5@h is a good save :)|pg||
nt|vasanti: kx and 2 aces also guaranteed shortage in @H in ps hand 3sp was better now?|pg||
nt|kastan88: North putting partne under pressure: why she is doubling without trump tricks?|pg||
nt|vasanti: 3@D from s might still save their game|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: EW are already in 3@H :)|pg||
nt|asig: 3NT now to collect the vul game bonus?|pg||
nt|vasanti: u true:)|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Berk: "I could have bid 3@c, I lose 2 spades, 2 hearts, 2 clubs ..." Lair: "I could have beaten it with a diamond out and a heart back"|pg||
nt|kit: two balanced hands, two distributional hands.  Let's see who bids the most.|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe E-W "save" is a make?  Lots of handling in 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: We're still waiting for Russ to get back from his smoke break - now he's here|pg||
nt|lc: 1@S  2@H  2@S,  then South drives to 4@H and E-W ...  we'll see.|pg||
nt|kit: West hand is good example of:  When you are void in their suit, bid one more than you think you should.|pg||
nt|lc: Also, when in doubt bid 4@S over 4@H|pg||
nt|lc: Although 4@H is down, so ...|pg||
nt|kit: and when you have spades, there is never doubt :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|mb|r|mb|4D|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|lc: So, 3@H blows E-W out.  Must be intermediate.|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s7|nt|kit: East very luck that the lead didn't cost a trick.  Just because partner bid the suit, doesn't mean he has the king.|pg||
nt|lc: You wouldn't lead a spade, Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: well, I would lead a spade before I would lead a heart|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ: "you play upside down?" Berk: "we play first discard is odd/even"|pg||
nt|kit: so I guess that makes it my third choice|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: I like my aces to capture their honors|pg||

mb|p|nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, but the Under 21 section started only in 2006, at World Championship level|pg||
mb|1D|nt|laurentiu: probably ... the only feasable way to rich that slam is to dbl with Diana's Hand|pg||

nt|eerdvegas: strange, just a normal game here|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 24hcp?|pg||
nt|eerdvegas: well I think all national squads would bid here the game|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|petergill: 3NT might dampen North's slam ambitions|pg||
nt|ahalim: and an easy one to play|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@c = cue - 1st or 2nd round control|pg||
nt|ahalim: you simply cannot misquess @D's :)|pg||
nt|ahalim: sry misguess|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT = non-serious about slam, hence 4@S cue later, since 3NT had already said that his hand was poor, so 4@C was a most serious slam try indeed|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S = 1st or 2nd round spade control, denies 1st or 2nd round @D control due to bypassing 4@D, hence North needs to think now, knowing no @Da opposite|pg||
nt|hobakan: :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mtvesuvius: The leaders at the moment are 1. Norway with 101 VPs 2. Germany with 95 VPs 3. France with 91 VPs|pg||
nt|petergill: North decides slam is a finesse and trump break at best, i.e. less than the required 50% |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Tarnovski now wants to sign off|pg||

nt|ahalim: wow|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: wow, well done|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Padon liked his club control and spots I bet|pg||
nt|petergill: Superficially, South might have passed 5@H, as the partnership might be off @DAK from South's point of view, but he takes the view that his hand could not be better and with no @DA ...|pg||
nt|petergill: nor @DK North would have bid 4@H not 4@C|pg||
nt|ahalim: albeit a little bit undisciplined :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: U26 :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|tomi2: bye|pg||
nt|petergill: In my opinion, slam is not that great a contract, a bit less than 50%, so reaching it is more good luck than good management, perhaps.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: how about if swap @SK with @Cx|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe then.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ: "I had sort of an intermediate jump overcall; I liked the lead; it was on the heart finesse; or a club onside"|pg||
nt|chip: I agree, decent defense and lots of losers.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 10-15 HCP, (a) 6+@C, 1-suit  (b) 4+@C and 5+@S|pg||
nt|chip: makes 4H unattractive.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|lc: Important to know now if X=@D or a good hand. Hope they discussed it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: 4@h with a chance to make in the closed room on 52 ( no @c shift)|pg||
nt|kit: now how does South know whether to choose clubs or spades on his hand?|pg||
nt|lc: West has both cases covered.|pg||
nt|chip: At least he has both.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlike Precision   this 2@D bid does NOT show any values|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Lair sort of alerted the DBL, but no questions|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: Pass denies 5+@S hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: another good example of partnership agreements -- you have to have a general rule on doubles of artificial calls like this, and stick to it|pg||
nt|chip: Ours is it shows the suit, right?|pg||
nt|lc: We play it shows @D.|pg||
nt|kit: yep|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kit: And now another double, this one takeout|pg||
nt|chip: Showing the suit is my default with Lew also.|pg||
nt|lc: What will Berk do if Lair doubles again?|pg||
nt|kit: And if East passes it, they just might take him out|pg||
nt|kit: well, 5 tricks are easier than 9, so .......|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Lair asks about 2@d. Granovetter won't write because it's now after sundown, so they get up and go away from the table and he explains, not quite loudly enough for me to hear|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: effectively  all hands without significant @C support  bid 2@D|pg||
nt|lc: Pass would get 500, it seems.|pg||
nt|kit: now that seems wrong -- means the other side knows that a bid is alerted and asked about|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ asks Berk if they have an agreement about the DBL of 2@d and he says not clear|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Easier to pass 3@C in a bidding contest than at the table where -670 is painful.|pg||
nt|kit: East's decision a big swing there|pg||
nt|lc: At least that's my defense of my partner.|pg||
nt|kit: simple LAW pass, right Larry?|pg||
nt|lc: You guys can all pile on and say that PASS was easy.  Yeah.|pg||
nt|chip: not a good hand for the NS system. No way for S to avoid playing a silly contract (way too high in 3C, but if he passes 2c, could be a 4-2 with a 5-3 spade fit).|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|kit: You gotta believe!|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|lc: Esspecially if partner has @D, pass makes sense.  But David's (and my) philosophy is try not to be -670 and win the match on some other board.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: figure  2 opponents guessing but only 1 partner|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chip: I think Pass was a good decision. Percentage, but could be wrong.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kit: my philosophy is a plus score is better than a minus score|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|chip: The 2C opening could have had 5S and 4 clubs (not a normal precision 2C).|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wish i'd used Kit's philosophy with stock market|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, but -670 not as good as + 140.|pg||
nt|kit: 2 of clubs a very bad idea here|pg||
nt|kit: if it occurs to declarer to stick in the 7, that extra trick might be the difference here.|pg||
nt|kit: playing the 7 of clubs is saying that Ekeblad made a bad play|pg||
nt|poohbear: isnt the term Grovesnor?|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|d4|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|c7|nt|kit: declarer probably okay anyway, as he is in overruffing position in both minors|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|kit: but maybe not -- that 2 of spades might be too small to compete with South's spades|pg||
nt|poohbear: Grovesnor is a play where the opponent purposely gives you a winning option when he ddint have to. Strictly to mess with your head|pg||
nt|kit: certainly South needs to ruff -- can't let that 2 of spades score|pg||
nt|poohbear: I am may have the spelling wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter seems to have the little diamond ready to play|pg||
nt|poohbear: Grosvenor I am told|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: But he's still thinking about it|pg||

nt|chip: yes, seems impossible on this auction.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip: plus he has the majority of his side's strength.|pg||

nt|petergill: Adam, are you gong to play in the Washington DC Nationals later this month? |pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|chip: But then we have to wait till after the hand (usually).|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter didn't realize he was dealer - they explain that no problems just didn't know who was dealer|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|r|nt|lc: East hand is actually easier to bid in Standard than in big @C.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|kit: most players would play this 3@H bid is looking for a heart stopper, as it is.|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|kit: well, this time heart lead is pretty easy|pg||
nt|kit: or so I thought|pg||
nt|lc: Strange leade, but will survive.|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|kit: so it comes down to spade guess -- he knows South has longer hearts, so will play king of spades first.  And then ......|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: now Granovetter known to be on minimum overcall - especially for him -- maybe infer singleton @S?|pg||
nt|lc: Would Granovetter overcall with @HKJxxx  @CA and a flat hand VUL?|pg||
nt|lc: I sure would (the way my partner's lead).|pg||
nt|lc: But Granovetter is indeed sound.|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe for that reason, Ekeblad should not have revealed the @CJ here.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Lair checked the clock - we have plenty of time, so he's taking a restroom break and Russ is smoking. Back soon|pg||
nt|lc: Is BBO available in the restroom?|pg||
nt|lc: :)|pg||
nt|lc: Players are not allowed to have any electronic decives, by the way.|pg||
nt|lc: A good rule in today's electronic age.|pg||
nt|chip: maybe if you have an iphone or equivalent (why security on those is tight)|pg||
nt|lc: They actually don't screen or check.  It is on the "honor system."|pg||
nt|chip: But harsh penalties if caught.|pg||
nt|lc: Players wouldn't intentionally have a device, but they often forget to unload them and accidentally walk in with one in pocket.|pg||
nt|lc: Several times, cell phones have gone off and caused big problems.|pg||
nt|lc: Not at this event, as far as I know.|pg||
nt|poohbear: somebody mentioned a cell phone going off|pg||
nt|poohbear: forget who|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can Lair afford to win, and play some @D to get better inferential count?|pg||
nt|kit: not too safely|pg||
nt|lc: I don't think so, since North could ruff a @D|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe opponents would give honest count in @D.  :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lc: Maybe.|pg||
nt|kit: and he still won't know about the clubs -- that jack of clubs doesn't have to be remotely honest|pg||

nt|poohbear: Jack of @cs sure looked like someone who wanted to tap dummy|pg||
nt|kit: jack of clubs meaningless -- unless somebody has 4 spades, dummy tap is meaningless|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Schwartz in similar position but  2 rounds of hearts, Passell overtakes cashes @CA and exits @D|pg||

nt|eggy: probably facing a weak NT, so will need perfect cards|pg||

mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 3@C game forcing raise|pg||

nt|ahollan1: thanks - i'm told it was P. Hal Sims|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: I suspect 3@D is a minimum and 3@H asks again.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|lc: Prob 3@S means "Shortness somewhere"|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe I'm making this up, but it sounds good.  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there were a couple of pairs in this event using  1M-2N as old fashioned balanced game force|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Berkowitz has written very neat, VERY TINY notes about this auction - even with my brand new glasses there is no chance I can read them, sorry|pg||
nt|chip: or perhaps a stiff club (low stiff?)|pg||
nt|lc: If it shows any short, presumably 3NT now by Lair to ask where.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|pg||
nt|lc: Jan, did you use "neat" and "Berkowitz" in the same sentence?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Vugraphu1: Yes and "tiny"|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|chip: note that while slam is virtually laydownhere, if E were 6-3-3-1 it would be quite poor.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|lc: Indeed.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even with computer -- my notes aren't neat|pg||
nt|chip: So W was a bit lucky to find partner with the right hand.|pg||
nt|lc: So, 3@S did show specifically @C shortness.  I guess Lair wasn't worried about being off @HAK.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Berk says that 3@d showed a minimum and 3@h asked and 3@s showed club shortness. Lair thought that 3@s showed balance with a little extra|pg||
nt|lc: Also, when no X of Artif 3@H, a @H lead is less likely.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: And now that I have looked at Berk's notes, I will admit that "neat" might have been a slight overbid, but 'tiny' wasn't|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|lc: You told us "VERY NEAT" -- I have it in writing.|pg||

nt|lc: All of Lair's @H plays trying to show lowest side suit (S.P.)|pg||
nt|lc: A big difference in the "expert" game is the constant use of subtle S.P. cards on defense.|pg||
nt|lc: Of course, your partner has to be watching.|pg||
nt|chip: Though some are more worried about helping declarer.|pg||
nt|lc: I remember the late great Bobby Goldman once told me that he is an excellent signaller but not as good a receiver.,|pg||

nt|ahollan1: board 57 about to be pushed at 6@S|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|Vugraphu1: Sorry, he had the A out but put it back|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lc: Also, there is a (bad) tendancy (habit) in a close, tense, important match such as this, to play quickly on the last board or two to run out and find out the result.|pg||

nt|chip: Fairly low scoring match, particularly with many wild boards.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: We have the score correct here - so Lynch has won by 3 IMPs. Out in the hall, Passell was telling his opponents that it was one of the best matches he'd played in|pg||

mb|1N|nt|ovncylmz: 5@sXX= in norway-turkey game|pg||
nt|eggy: I suppose that the N hand os a "routine" opener nowadays|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Whereas Roland has no interest in it at all|pg||
nt|cascade: a strong NT overcall|pg||
nt|cascade: many play a two-suited 1NT in this seat|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|cascade: personally i prefer the strong NT|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: club lead works better for defense|pg||

pc|c2|nt|laurentiu: 4 more boards to go ... and 4 more imps for France|pg||

nt|MolvaM: bize böyle operatör lazým|pg||
nt|MolvaM: operator? whats happening?  tell us please !|pg||
nt|voldenuit: hard to guess in @d the correct handle in @d is small for the queen and small for the 10 |pg||
nt|fabsayc: no he forces defense to play them|pg||
nt|voldenuit: interesint hand |pg||
nt|eggy: and also leading the Junior Women's event by 5VP|pg||
nt|eggy: The womens event ends tomorrow with France playing their last match against 2nd placed Poland  .|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: hello all |pg||
nt|sybarra2: in the room I was just in,   4 @S was piece of cake |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, but a 25 year old is hardly a girl|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Vugraphztt: im in Rama theater waiting for table operator to imput biding|pg||
nt|fabsayc: call me crazy, i overcall 3nt with south hand|pg||
nt|cascade: another IMP for France |pg||
mb|d|nt|kastan88: yeah, for sure NS will bid slam, but how many clubs will bid West after opening?|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: W has a good sac in any @C game or slam|pg||
nt|kastan88: 6@C for pick slam?|pg||
nt|voldenuit: I wld have bid 2@c |pg||
nt|cascade: oh is 25 old :)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|laurentiu: on open rooms ... it was difficult to  bid 3nt or 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|kastan88: what now 6@D, 6@S or even 6NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: 6@S is on, even with the 4-1 trump split|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Needs some work though|pg||
nt|kastan88: 6@D too...|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Yes, but I'm a pairs tiger :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: junior Tiger?|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: You need to ruff two @Cs in dummy and get both finesses right|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: This is getting close to a Wald-slam :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Though the finesses are marked by the 5@C bid|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 3@c by nico?|pg||
nt|eggy: this looks pretty straightforward|pg||
nt|cascade: France did well to get to 4@H in the other room|pg||
nt|cascade: and then make it|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Once hearts are supported South is worth game|pg||
mb|3D|nt|laurentiu: on 16-th|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the double may work well, ew will not realize they have huge diamond fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahalim: I have to leave now Adam, it's almost midnight :(|pg||
nt|kastan88: only 1 ruff: 4@D+4@S+3@H+ 1 ruff, you cant ruff 2 times, then you cant take finesse in spades playing 6@S|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Good bids by both Sorensen and Heim|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: You're right :)|pg||
nt|eggy: so lets hope it's on BBO|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mtvesuvius: ok, thanks Arifin :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: gn :)|pg||
nt|voldenuit: it's strange he bids 3@c with 4@s |pg||
nt|sybarra2: need to get the @S suit in soon |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: But since the age of the players starts at 13 and ends at 25, it's not that easy to name the series. Girls, Women, Young Ladies. Take your prick|pg||
mb|p|nt|laurentiu: here ... on 4 hearts contract ... declarer has to guess diamonds|pg||
nt|ahalim: was nice working with you|pg||
nt|ahalim: bye|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: enjoyed :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, NS's bidding looks mysterious to me|pg||
nt|voldenuit: quentin robert has a huge hand now |pg||
nt|sybarra2: transfer |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i prefer a 2@C opener actually|pg||
nt|eggy: presumably 2H was texas|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: ok thanks :)  and good luck|pg||
nt|sybarra2: super accept |pg||
nt|Walddk4: pick even|pg||
nt|cascade: if we raise to game with our 14 counts that might disuade partner from raising with a 4-3-3-3 6 count|pg||
nt|Walddk4: embarrassing typo, I am sorry|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mtvesuvius: and then there was one... :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Oh my|pg||
nt|kastan88: now much intersting, is there possible to win 7@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: The handes are mirrored too much in distribution, can only discard one club on the @Hs|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: @CA lead might help|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the more i look at this auction, the more i think there is a wrong bid|pg||
nt|sybarra2: should bid 4 @S now |pg||
pc|s4|nt|kastan88: now just winning, taking finesses right|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Imo Mortensen's bid of 7@S is a bid reckless|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: You just asked P to bid a slam, she did and then you go ahead and bid grand?|pg||
nt|kastan88: more diffy with @H lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how are england doing?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra2: 3 nt makes also |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|laurentiu: to be or not to be ... :)|pg||
nt|laurentiu: on the good side :)|pg||
nt|eggy: please don't ask|pg||
nt|eggy: although we have a slight chance of saving the test match|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they used to be called the "girls"  but this year  have matured to "women"|pg||
nt|cascade: more embarrassing if you were discussing the boys :)|pg||
nt|namial1: a swing for France|pg||
nt|cascade: i am sure you are forgiven Roland|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In the other room West led a diamond - but East played the six!!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphztt: Kib suggesting a forcing pass to show a void in @C over 7@C|pg||
nt|kastan88: oh yes my eyes old, club overruff|pg||
nt|kastan88: so lack of @S6 in South hand is trouble|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: What if you ruff with the @SK?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are we sure of that first double?|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: yep|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm not|pg||
nt|voldenuit: Nord isn't the kind to bid 3@c with 4@s he has put a @s in his @c probably |pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: U have to belive me:)|pg||
nt|xenya: oh we do :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we do and we don't at the same time|pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and in other room,  we discussed what was better|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Vugraphztt: :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|laurentiu: he has chosen well|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu ilginç 1 kontrat|pg||
nt|eerbil: bir sürü elde batacak bir kontrata geldiler ama maalesef þimdi deðil|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|xenya: 12 tricks can be made|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I have made worse if that is any consolation|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kastan88: need @S8 or 6 in South hand|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|laurentiu: now  it is done|pg||
nt|laurentiu: next|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and the @c spots are perfect for declarer|pg||
nt|MolvaM: evet her empas tutuyor. batmayacak|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: on a @S finesse|pg||
nt|chessmaste: No - a swing for Poland! |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|MolvaM: neyse beterin beteri var. anlaþamayýp 6 trefle de gelebilirlerdi|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: this will be 1 more IMP to Belgium|pg||
pc|s8|nt|voldenuit: it's strange nico didn't bid 3@s then |pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|ovncylmz: difficult to defend?|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: @d10|pg||
nt|xenya: 4th @S going on the @HQ|pg||

nt|namial1: no |pg||
mb|p|nt|laurentiu: 4 hearts or spade on this board for EW, and a good defence for NS if they will bid 5 of a minoir|pg||
nt|laurentiu: something is wrong here|pg||
nt|laurentiu: it can't be on south this bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: lets see if e/w can find the @H game |pg||
nt|cascade: so 25 IMPs with two boards to go|pg||
nt|cascade: it is closer than it seems since Poland need to win by 13 to win the GOLD medal|pg||
nt|Walddk4: France need 13 of those, but you never know. It's round 13, played on the 13th|pg||
mb|1S|nt|MolvaM: bu bakýmdan bu maçlarda son 4 bordda uyanýk olmak gerek. maç uzadýkça hata potansiyeli artýyor|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 3NT seems winning |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztt: Meanwhile the Netherlands are expanding their victory on England: 25-5. France is beating Hungary by the same numbers, which brings them 5 VP apart in the ranking. We're looking at ...|pg||
nt|vugraphztt:  3 Denmark winning by 24-6 with more IMPs to come|pg||

mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: I'm told that 2@h is 8+ with 3@s|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if 2nt is a three card raise of some kind, need a bit more science|pg||
nt|voldenuit: one off in 4@s |pg||
nt|sybarra2: seems e/w not getting into the auction at all |pg||
nt|sybarra2: now 6 @H tricks and ak of @D later |pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: maybe 3 down is better|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: but i think will be only 2 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: 6lý körle yapmaz artýk canýmmmmm.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe down 2|pg||
nt|sybarra2: probably 4 down |pg||

pc|s7|pc|dJ|nt|MolvaM: uzun süre önde giderken geriye düþmek üzereyiz|pg||
