nt|sybarra: so @C lead |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I'd probably lead a @D, for I don't want to lead into decl's suit, not trumps and not away from Kxxxx|pg||
nt|Gerben42: good play by Rusch here, draw trumps when they have the balance of power|pg||

nt|tomi2: E/W are both newcommers to international youth Bridge, I guess they are first time on Vugraph - so let's hope they will do fine... I am sure!|pg||
nt|andy_h: Usually in these types of auctions where 1 person has shown 2 suits and their partner took preference, is to lead trumps.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|davidb: N showed a good raise . |pg||

pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|andy_h: Sometimes they say, don't bother looking at any of your other cards. Lead a trump no matter what! (Usually will work 85% of the time I assure you)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Gerben42: Netherlands as usual medal candidates in this competition, but this match will be a tough one|pg||

nt|Gerben42: 20-board matches are long... I wonder how they will deal with it|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|Gerben42: who would Dbl in S?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kaapo: The Swedish bridge federation has put up a nice presentation, only in Swedish though: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.1917|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT might be 11-13 or so|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 2@D probably a multi style, showing a long major|pg||
nt|tomi2: Max Ellerbeck did :)|pg||
nt|andy_h: I would. Maybe South is worried about @Hxxx but that wouldn't detour me in not doubling. By X-ing you get 3 suits across|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: So for those who missed it, Poland came in first in the girls series, followed by France and the Netherlands|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would consider a pass here, but thats the reason I am not playing there anymore... I am too old|pg||
nt|Gerben42: same here from the 30+ camp|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|davidb: we watch 2 experienced pairs -I  believe we will see good bridge|pg||
nt|Jacki: Does someone in here need to be ungagged to comment?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: In my opinion N's @Ds aren't good enough for a 4NT overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Results.htm for all results|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=733&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1 for running scores|pg||
nt|Gerben42: good one for your system talk: is 2NT natural here or does it show no preference...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: The U26 Open category has a day off today, hence they don't have running scores|pg||
nt|tomi2: south is now "endplayed" I think he should try some kind of 2NT bid and wait for something good to happen|pg||
nt|Gerben42: for me 2NT is not natural in auctions where one opp opened and the other bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, then Nab will bid 3@D and will become declarer, thats the best that can happen to south :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|MolvaM: bazý ellerde vugraf operatörleri oynanan kartlarý yanlýþ girebiliyorlar ama sonradan düzeltiyorlar|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yani burada undo oldu diye masada da undo oldu diye düþünmeyiniz lütfen |pg||
nt|ozgull: evet çok güvenmemek lazým|pg||
nt|MolvaM: gerçek hayatta undo yok biliyorsunuz|pg||
nt|ozgull: son el pik gelse batýyordu gibi gözüksede belkide öyle olmadý|pg||
nt|MolvaM: vugraf operatörleri de son maça yorgun girdiler :)|pg||
nt|eerbil: pik ataðý normal ama Arda'nýn trefllerine tek antresi maalesef yýkýlacak|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: srry|pg||
mb|3S|nt|davidb: 3H =inv 5-5|pg||
nt|ozgull: açýk odadan anladýðýmýz gibi ingilizler 12-14 NT oynuyorlar|pg||
nt|kastan88: misfit on NS, possible that West will start doubling now|pg||
nt|kastan88: he was faster (West)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Simonsen is thinking|pg||
nt|andy_h: Very nice treatment of the 2NT bid in competition - showing 2 places to play|pg||
mb|d!|nt|davidb: Sp 3-3 so 6H makable|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: belki de 10-12 dir?|pg||
nt|eerbil: tek þansýmýz oynayanýn trefl asýný ilk 2 turdan birinde almasý, ki pek olasý bir oyun deðil|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ingiltere takýmý da genel klasman 11.si|pg||
nt|kaapo: 4@S is a great contract and 5@D an excellent sacrifice|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: France are at the moment at the top of the U26 group|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I can imagine S being especially unlucky, given his semi-wasted @S values|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: c|pg||
nt|andy_h: I personally wouldn't have bid with N's hand. All it's going to do is that it may excited partner (when you don't really want to given the void in clubs). Given N has 3spadeds ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: (marking shortage with partner) then S may still re-open|pg||
nt|Gerben42: i wouldnt have doubled in N either... what if pd simply has 12 HCP and good 6-card @C, I dont want to be anywhere|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Dbl of 3@S = dont lead that pd|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphztr: Decl can't handle the Jxxx with W|pg||
mb|p|nt|Jacki: Please let me know if you need to be ungagged|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so the way is free for quite some undertricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: X must be some game invitation|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kaapo: Sweden is tied on the 4th place and Latvia tied on the 7th|pg||
nt|tomi2: he will lead spades anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|ozgull: ingiltere'de beginnerlara 1NT açýþý 12-14 tür diye gösterildiði için öyle tahmin ettim|pg||
nt|MolvaM: vugrafta daha sýk yer alabilmemiz için takýmýmýzýn klasmanda yükselmesi gerek|pg||
nt|yuval10: N did well to remove the 3NT, but 5@disn't likely to make either|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|vugraphztr: anybody here who wants to comment?|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: *with E|pg||
nt|ort21: hi|pg||
nt|yuval10: I think N is doing way too much considering the bidding and the fact he has doubleton @s|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|Jacki: and florin who is a vugraph operator|pg||
nt|yuval10: question is - does S unlimited in this sequence? i think he's limited , by 3@d|pg||
nt|yuval10: so N knows that S has 3 aces, but what can he have more?|pg||
nt|minnie lee: good day to all|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi Minnie|pg||
mb|d|nt|davidb: slam needs 3-2 in H & 3-3 in Sp - 35 %  slam|pg||
nt|waso: so big swing for France|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: @h2 now by E, to get two @H tricks and a ruff|pg||

mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: yes.|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|vdoubleu: Yes, key here.|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: Why?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: confirmed 4d= blackwood 4s 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with no X of 4S, may avoid that suit on lead|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: hi all|pg||
nt|waso: hiii|pg||
nt|kaapo: First board, which we mostly missed, was a push. The double on board 2 brought Latvia the first 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|kaapo: More wild distributions|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would have overcalled 2@c   but if I was going to bring @ds in I would bid 2NT|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4NT is excessive|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree,  seemed a bit much|pg||
nt|sybarra: that lovely sp suited opened in both rooms |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: The strength of your hand are the @Cs, not your distribution per se, I think|pg||
nt|Gerben42: nice fit EW but no slam|pg||
nt|tomi2: you can watch Max Ellerbeck's nice defense to 3@S in the movie, he found the @C ruff in 2nd trick accorcing to their signaling methods and so they defeated 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: ercan-gündoðdu güzelce oynamýþlar þlemi ama sanýrým pek alýþveriþ olmaz bu elde|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|kaapo: It appers that NS could make 7@D|pg||
nt|kaapo: But perhaps they'll stop at 6|pg||
nt|tomi2: Dutch EW did well to stop in game here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: the 9 showed the @C switch?|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|poohbear: Ok that was easy|pg||
nt|kastan88: IMO problem starts from South bid 3@S, he may see probable misfit, but we must remember these ara juniors, so blood is hot|pg||
nt|sybarra: now how do you play 2 nt here?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Not so sure I would overcall 1NT here, I like 2@D|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@C is either: 12-14 bal OR natural 12+ OR 18+ any distr.|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes|pg||
nt|tomi2: and the 3@C bid showed the @D suit|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Dutch EW did not stop in game after all...|pg||
nt|minnie lee: results: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Results.htm|pg||
nt|yuval10: E did very well here to judge that her cards in the minors worth a game|pg||

nt|Gerben42: Nab using Sabine's tactic: bid 2@D over 1@C whenever possible :)|pg||

nt|Gerben42: what would 2NT after 2@S have been? |pg||
nt|tomi2: 2NT does not exist but must be forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Curiously, the scoring system seems to believe there hasn't been an exchange of IMPs yet in this match|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphztr: one down?|pg||
nt|waso: yes|pg||
nt|waso: one of each|pg||

nt|Gerben42: so flat board... |pg||

nt|vugraphztr: probably the name 'closed' is turning them away|pg||
nt|gracelin: normally specs follow the players they know|pg||
nt|tomi2: ok, we have the Norwegian Star Lindqvist playing there, but of course our players here are also top players|pg||
nt|tomi2: in this event they dont start with board 18 so you dont get extra results from altrady played hands|pg||

nt|tomi2: all through this event|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Gerben42: so maybe E hand is too weak for 2@S?|pg||

pc|dT|nt|davidb: now may make|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|kastan88: and 8 IMPs back to Norway, or N testing East in Dias?, no|pg||
nt|tomi2: now he has 7 points and one was useless, I think east's hand is a bit below minimum for his bid but I can understand his bid|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
mc|10|nt|tomi2: Poland was 3rd 2 years ago and 2nd last year in World Championships, Norway 4th in Jesolo and 3rd in Beijing|pg||
nt|tomi2: W could maybe (in case he was sure about partner knowing his spade fit) try 4@H instead of 4NT asking partner to sign off with minimum and bid on with maximum?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I don't agree with the @H discard here by S, decl could still have 4 @H, I think|pg||

nt|tomi2: this looks like some 2 way checkbac auction|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2D seems to be a GF chec back or relay|pg||
nt|tomi2: souths 2@D is artifical and gameforcing, says nothing about @D's|pg||

nt|kaapo: And 3NT was in fact suggested by a kib|pg||
nt|sybarra: we can refil coffee 's |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Haha, yeah|pg||
nt|poohbear: not exactly a nobrainer 6C could have been bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: no brainer in 3 nt  |pg||
nt|sybarra: but you are right Barry |pg||
nt|poohbear: perhaps. Should that be East's bid? |pg||
nt|tomi2: I like that range, it gives you room in other auctions because there your bids are either NF or GF, like 1@D - 1@S - 2@C - 3@S... you can set a force here without using 4th suit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|davidb: should be a normal board|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: the players must've heard him/her|pg||
nt|rodal f: Other room roads splitted at 2@C. There 2@D|pg||
nt|gh1: i think is dificult too bid 7 now|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|poohbear: need a @c lead or a @s lead and a @c shift|pg||
nt|poohbear: for the defense to prevail|pg||
nt|gracelin: usually it's played over a 1NT rebid, but here they extended to any rebid.|pg||
nt|tomi2: now he will support partnesr spades showing 4 card support and 12+hcp whil a direct jump to 4@S would indicate more shape and less high cards|pg||
nt|gracelin: could beat it with a low H lead |pg||
nt|tomi2: spade bids below 4@S would have been invitational to slam after 2@D|pg||
nt|gracelin: but really tough under the bidding|pg||
nt|tomi2: but after south bid strong and his screenmate even thinks now ot go on maybe east should try some agressive lead|pg||
nt|gracelin: Any other lead will see 4S home|pg||
nt|tomi2: "they are thinking of taking more than 10 tricks and I must hold them to 9 - then I need some miracle"|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mr. Simonsen does not appear to like passing just yet|pg||
nt|gracelin: but it's always the case when opponent bid to a game|pg||
nt|tomi2: does anybody know if N/S are a long time partnership?|pg||

pc|dA|nt|MolvaM: kör ataðýna zorlanýr mý?|pg||

nt|andy_h: auction gets competitive, you may need to guess whether to still bid 3@S or not|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphztr: do U think they know abou diam fit?:)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe north took 4@S as some splinter bid for either hearts or dias or so? I am just suggesting|pg||
nt|gracelin: As thomas said, south will bid less spades after 2D if he has slam ambition|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 'about'|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why don't E show the @D support?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: when?|pg||

nt|ozgull: direkt 2NT birþeye tranfer olduðu için böyle yapmak zorunda olsa gerek|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2 kör, 2 karo ve 1 trefl lövesi?|pg||
nt|eerbil: kör ataðý gelse de defans trefl lövesine yetiþemiyor|pg||
nt|gracelin: or north treated 4S as kick-back with Heart agreed ?|pg||
nt|tomi2: zatorski chose the safe way of just raising to 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mr Skjetne is surprised to have the tray returned back empty|pg||
nt|andy_h: One major downside of course, is that you prevent partner from describing the nature of their hand as 2M takes up a lot of room.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|MolvaM: sonuç olarak bu borddan kaybýmýz olmayacaðýný görmek iyi|pg||

nt|andy_h: Bad breaks for whoever becomes declarer|pg||
nt|tomi2: wonder if South said "thank you partner" when his dummy came down in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: I think EW play 10-13 1NT when non-vulnerable|pg||
nt|kastan88: if partner has 2 diamond tricks, then this 2@S is down, if not, even @H ducking not better, just easy to count declarer's distribution|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: shitshappening:)|pg||
nt|gh1: Ax in H ig spade lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Near by 3NT but 2 are enough.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|poohbear: 3@c is a " mixed raise " 6-8 points and 4 trumps|pg||
nt|gracelin: now south is stuck with no chance to ask for a club stopper|pg||
nt|tomi2: just bid 3NT and pray :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: a Brave young man will bid 3NT himself.|pg||
nt|sybarra: they dont know that yet|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Exactly|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be laughing in comparison perhaps |pg||
nt|sybarra: or over beers later |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Most likely :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Heya Mildred :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: similar here I'm afraid|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: They might stop at 3@H|pg||
nt|ort21: someone has the live results ?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|syl: 4h-nice save|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Bogen actually alerted 3@H, Johansen did not...|pg||
nt|sybarra: need to agree with pard whether this bid is asking or telling |pg||
nt|rodal f: A good try also in 3@SNS|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=11&qshowflag=1|pg||

nt|tomi2: I have been told there has been a revoke in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|ozgull: 11 daha çok iyi baþladýk|pg||
nt|kaapo: Or 4 :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: or just forcing |pg||
mb|3C|nt|davidb: good lead .needs 10 only to be a good one better than Sp|pg||
nt|gracelin: he is braver and bid the higher contract|pg||
nt|kastan88: now @D shift?|pg||
nt|gh1: now a x and 3H:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: -1 looks very cheap|pg||
nt|tomi2: and after my p bids 3@S I would not say thank you partner as south!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 3@S was easy to Dbl, maybe a Dbl of 2@H would have been already correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: Game is decent but would go down unless declarer could ferret out the offside singleton King|pg||
nt|kaapo: Both major suits are nicely|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|ort21: tx |pg||
mb|3N|nt|poohbear: not impossible if he finds out about Souths honors|pg||
mb|p|nt|mildredb: i would play X of 3@D as penalty by west|pg||
nt|andy_h: It's a bit unclear whether E should act over (3@D)-P-(P)-   (I wouldn't) but now the 3@S makes it easier!|pg||
nt|yuval10: some may think that the bidding was switched, but it wasn't...|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: I am confident that my former junior partner would have bid 3nt, so I hope he is sitting south in his match :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: but even if south declarered 3NT, West might cash CK then shift to HQ|pg||
nt|gracelin: for the same two down|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mr Sikora has his head on the table now|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: As soon as the @SJ came down Nab thanked :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think I would lead a club in this auction, trying to get "natural" tricks first|pg||
nt|Gerben42: as I said, I would dbl 2@H|pg||
nt|Gerben42: after that, the party starts :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: as EW play mini-NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: yeah, it is easy to say here, if we can see all hands, not easy to find right switch for West|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Good X, 4@S should go off a few|pg||
nt|sybarra: think so |pg||
nt|yuval10: and yet another disaster for Sweden in the OR|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gracelin: bidding was wierd in closed room.  North opened 2C and NS stopped in 4D.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|MolvaM: arda ve erdem bu elden 11 kazanacaklarýný düþünmüyordur herhalde.|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Don't agree with 4@S btw|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|gracelin: I meant in ope room|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C was for both majors weak|pg||
nt|tomi2: sinche they bid 3 suits and my partner also I think club is the one I can expect to get most|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|poohbear: South should try to conceal honors by winning the Ace of ! and returning the Q|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: N bid 1H with 3 cards. Maybe is transfer for spades|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|poohbear: @cs|pg||
nt|kaapo: So there isn't much in the play|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: Stafie's pard opened the bidding and he has good hand with K of @S,   and will look for signal for entry |pg||
nt|tomi2: hope W will not play @SA|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'm not sure what was the 1@h overcall by N in the OR, a psych possible, over 1@c strong when P is passed hand|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: sorry She |pg||
nt|rodal f: Home if J@C are to be found|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Gerben42: Tomi he played before :)|pg||

pc|cK|nt|kastan88: now @D|pg||
nt|tomi2: last week I pinned two singleton honors with my partners, I am expert in this :)|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s6|nt|Gerben42: 300 extra now :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yuval10: i think it was a psych,hence S's 2@h|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer has seen 12 points in south. If he sees the QJ of @h or if he sees no overuff in @ds then he prob gets it right|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thinking|pg||
nt|poohbear: On the previous 2 boards Russia scored 7 then 12|pg||
nt|gh1: and -1|pg||
pc|h7|nt|poohbear: yes terrible holding in everysuit|pg||

pc|s4|nt|poohbear: might regret wasting the 10 @s|pg||

nt|kareno: Snapdragon double was employed in the CR to get east as declarer in spades.|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|kareno: The auction started 1@c - 1@d - 1@h - double, showing spades with heart tolerance.|pg||

nt|yuval10: and things starts very well for the 5th seeded team|pg||
mb|2H!|an|10-13 & 5+ Hearts|nt|vugraphztr: I think 3@S was an overbid too, for that matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: hi all, in from the Open|pg||
nt|waso: 5c  -1|pg||
mb|2N!|an|inv|nt|davidb: great  grand ! but not easy to reach even 6 .perfect fit. void vs o points|pg||
nt|tomi2: watching the other results on hand 5 you see some could stop in 2@S or 3@D and did not get doubled, only 3@S and upwards got punished|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think nobody was going to double 3@D here too|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@H and 3N makes EW with a few correct guesses|pg||
nt|mariner1: Q@H and Q@S right, along with the Aces|pg||
nt|waso: 5c=|pg||
nt|syl: why -1|pg||
nt|waso: 6c|pg||
nt|waso: 6c -1   |pg||
nt|waso: 5c=|pg||

mb|3C!|nt|kaapo: 6@D on board 3 has was bid 5 times out of 20|pg||
nt|poohbear: u mean 3@h?|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think thats ok|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: OR playing same contract previous board|pg||
nt|sybarra: is S thinking of a splinter?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: 3NT?|pg||

nt|waso: i dont believe east will pass|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ..|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 4H?|pg||
nt|waso: east will play the hand  5c  or 6c  |pg||
nt|syl: what about 5@C in 1. seat|pg||
nt|kaapo: *was bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: J@C was found? Adrian|pg||
mb|3H|nt|poohbear: I believe Ruso should bid to define her hand once partner responds. I would bid 2@c'|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: she bid 3diam|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: not good|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 5clubs in 1st seat|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe without the ace of diam|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2 pairs collected 1100 defending against 2@HX|pg||
nt|kastan88: occasionally West @D was 32, so was difficult to East assume, that partner 2 is from doubleton, probably Jxx|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D shows 5+ cards (if bal 12-14) or 4+ unbal in their system|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: OK:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: me too:)|pg||
nt|ozgull: þehmus ile güney tahmin ediyorum þu anda çok moralliler|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D for me is an underbid but it works out well here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: but she lead a club|pg||
nt|syl: @d trap may avoided.|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hanna gabor thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I think she dont like 3sp bid|pg||
nt|syl: 3@H rebid would have been the simplest|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep she have right hand on the head|pg||
nt|yuval10: making 10 tricks in @s is a lot...|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h looks like going down|pg||
nt|yuval10: N has to play @d after he wins the first @s|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: too many conventional bidding for Sweden ... I think...|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mariner1: well W must not have realized the 2@S was a game try here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bazý çiftler kontrdan sonraki koz tutuþlarýný göstermek için transferli deklareler oynuyorlar|pg||
nt|eerbil: Arda'nýn kontrdan sonra eðer transfer oynuyorlarsa iyi kör yükseltmesi anlamýnda 2@d demesi daha iyi olurdu|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: aie|pg||
nt|syl: 5@C NOW|pg||
nt|gracelin: with those weak spots, I would not be interested to penalize opponents in 2D, so would Cue 3D instead.|pg||
nt|kaapo: However, all tabes should find a slam here|pg||
nt|kaapo: North would now like to ask for aces outside of spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully landing in a safe 4 @H now |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Never mind, 4@CX lol|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: srry was my mistake:(|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 3 NT DBL|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|raghavan: Hello, I am Ragavan from chennai of India |pg||

nt|vugraphztr: !|pg||
nt|MolvaM: muhtemelen arda ciçek bu konv oynamýyor|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes|pg||
nt|tomi2: my partner will never play me for support and 3 aces, maybe he will even pass 2@D|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not the best dession from N. Will cost some IMPs|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|vugraphztr: srry 4 undo|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: called by Chaugny|pg||

nt|yuval10: S must know that E has 2@c's|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kaapo: 4NT would not be a great idea, because if partner responds 1 key card, you cannot tell if it's the @SA or the @CK|pg||

nt|kastan88: Running scores for Open class: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=8&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice club suits being dealt today |pg||
nt|andy_h: Conflicting factors now with N's hand|pg||
nt|Gerben42: this hand is tricky in 2/1, you have to decide if this is GF or inv. before seeing partners 2@D rebid|pg||
nt|andy_h: Positives: Good 5card suit, QT9 (good) support and a singleton.  Negatives: Singleton King and only 3 trumps|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would bid some kind of systematic bid that does not allow my partner to pass before game is reached and try to show my hearts too|pg||
nt|Gerben42: you mean 2@H :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: so I start with 2@H and bid 4@S later|pg||
nt|yuval10: costs 2 imps.... +7 instead +9|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|charles_l: looks like some excitement|pg||
nt|raghavan: a slam hand - let us enjoy how they reach slam and make|pg||
nt|babydolldk: Nice slam with A @H onside|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h is normal here but the breaks are really cruel|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@S best NS spot|pg||
mb|2H|nt|gracelin: bery rare to see a passed out board in youth eent.  They get matured|pg||
nt|gracelin: very|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps NS bid another 3NT here?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Although it might not be that great on a @C lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|mariner1: 1@C is Polish @c|pg||
nt|lestergold: only making game for n/s 4s tho 5dims can be let thru|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maçlar 20 boardluk|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1D probably showed H, and 2H confirmed 4-card support|pg||
nt|gracelin: With half his honors in opponents' suit, south better contend with 3H or a try|pg||
nt|kastan88: after 1@S vuln from West, how many points in @S will put North into partner's hand?|pg||
nt|tomi2: now south solved noth's problem :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: W maybe should bid 3@c over XX?|pg||
nt|babydolldk: Unless you lead a @H 6@D is only 1100 v. 1370:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: This is a forcing Pass by E|pg||
nt|ozgull: bu arada girls romanya ya karþý 30 - 5 önde|pg||
nt|rodal f: If N was active now|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if 2NT could be GF also, seems like 4@S kills a lot of space|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, south has a decent hand if partner wants to investigate slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: I think 2C may be either natural or a balanced GF|pg||
nt|kastan88: test time now: what is meaning of pass over 2@S doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well south having shown his spades first presumably this will be played in spades now|pg||
nt|eerbil: sanýrsam bu elden kaybedeceðiz|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu elde karo pozisyonu nedeni ile þlem sorunsuz|pg||
nt|begse: sanslý bi slem |pg||
pc|dK|nt|begse: gitmemek hatta 5 e cýkmamak lazým|pg||
nt|syl: wrong sided so|pg||
nt|syl: may even fail|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 1NT from Aurelie!!!:)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Board 6 is at the moment recorded as round pass in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: a director asked to look at my movie and went to check|pg||
nt|kaapo: That shuold be fixed soon, when they actually play the board|pg||
nt|Walddk4: On a diamond lead you can make it on cross-ruff, but it requires that you cash clubs first. So you need clubs to break|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you play a second diamond like declarer did in the other room, South will pitch a club and you go down|pg||
nt|yuval10: def. will play trumps after Q@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: and then after 2nd @d S can ruff and play trumps again|pg||
nt|yuval10: will it matters?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: nope|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh well, also missed the 4@S, tough hand to land right|pg||
nt|mariner1: I guess 5@S can make too though|pg||
nt|lestergold: after 4d it wa surely correct fopr north to give preference to spades he had al reay bid the pips off a 6 card heart suit with poor intermediates|pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure that is possible either|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a lost opportunity for a swing here unless north 'corrects' to spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe 2 clubs is checkback|pg||
nt|kastan88: and that's it, if partner not having any points in spades, where are his 12 points for opening?, still could ask for aces, IMO|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Lauks and the two aces from his hand:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and he said: one down will be enough|pg||
nt|rodal f: Should become a flat board by normal defence|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mariner1: in Open Room S bid @S twice and they still did not get to 4@S|pg||
nt|gracelin: a spade lead, club shift and duck, will beat even 3H|pg||
nt|kastan88: here is clear, that NS  have not the same pinion about pass over 2@S doubled from South hand. But such situations need to agree exactly. showing this 1 stopper or half stopper or ...|pg||
nt|kastan88: nothin in spades, or just minimum hand whatever, but agreement needed|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|charles_l: its pretty much 16+ with @c, what he has|pg||
nt|gracelin: This maximum defense is in fact a reasonable one|pg||
nt|kaapo: On this lead, EW could keep South out of his hand|pg||
nt|kastan88: sr for mistyping. opinion , not pinion :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|charles_l: (assuming polish @c)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Not much excitement - only they have not reached a makeable C slam|pg||
nt|mariner1: a none @c lead allows a make|pg||
nt|mariner1: non|pg||
nt|lestergold: now Jones ha to find the killing club lead |pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@s will not fare well\|pg||
nt|kaapo: But @Hs are splitting, too|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|lestergold: and he has|pg||
nt|poohbear: even with that lead not much declarer can do to avoid going 2 off|pg||
nt|poohbear: Best to win in Dummy and play a @c to try to negotiate a ruff|pg||
nt|poohbear: alternatively if you trust the lead you can draw trumps and if 3-2 play for 4 @d tricks and then lead a @c off dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Brian Senior is here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: making pictures|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: this is a jr event!|pg||
nt|poohbear: not a senior moment :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might gain some IMPs again for Russia. @H lead? Seemed normal for me!|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|yuval10: i guess not, as you take 6@h, 3@c, 1@d|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: well all the other uits have been bid naturally|pg||
nt|lestergold: falase card will not fool ed|pg||
nt|Gerben42: apparently 2NT cannot be a "good GF"|pg||
nt|yuval10: S would've done better to let N takes the trick and play Q@d|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Sandra is thinking|pg||
nt|yuval10: take in dummy, @c to J, ruff @s....etc|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: is not easy...|pg||
nt|yuval10: nothing is...|pg||

nt|syl: @H" can mislead pd|pg||
nt|gracelin: the duck is the more difficult part|pg||
nt|gracelin: now declarer is safe|pg||
nt|tomi2: taking the ace and then thinking about the situation is not the best solution|pg||
nt|tomi2: he actually does not need much more then norths hand to have a good @D slam for example|pg||

nt|tomi2: let's see if they find their @H fit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Muiderberg used against a Dutch pair, the irony :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mariner1: a trump lead here is best vs @H|pg||
nt|eerbil: açanýn karo kontrolü olmadýðýný ve dengeli eli olduðunu bilirken iyi bir þlem deðil bence|pg||
nt|gh1: or spade J|pg||
nt|yuval10: OR i guess natural 1NT opening and all pass|pg||
nt|yuval10: a different story here though|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: clubs lie badly too many losers in the black s in east's hand to be dealt with bearing in mind a 3/1 rump break|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am glad to see people can still double for penalty, eapecially by the youth.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 nt =weak with both minors |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Not a very useful convention in my opinion|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some 700 I belive Adrian|pg||
nt|tomi2: thats not exactly muiderberg|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@H is both majors weak for our pair too|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 3NT is probably a maximum with @D as sidesuit|pg||
nt|tomi2: while 2@C shows @H and another suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: E  does not like XXX in Spades ..|pg||
nt|lestergold: and over ruff threats in dims|pg||
nt|poohbear: another competitive battle at the game level here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Now, is South's double for penalty?|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|charles_l: normal to be in 4@h down here|pg||

nt|mariner1: well they should be warned about the breaks now|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: bu kontr negatif sanýrým ama tutulsa fena olmaz|pg||
nt|tomi2: nice play by west in the open room for 3nt=|pg||

nt|vugraphztr:   NT = pass or correct|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 3NT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: only pass possible response... 3NT wont have problems|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: According to E, 3NT showed a 4-card, however, I could not deduct which|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: getting to 3NT|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D was natural, most of the time with 5 cards|pg||
nt|kaapo: I like to play that way|pg||
nt|sybarra: has its moments  |pg||
nt|tomi2: If there are any kids (below 18 years) watching this vugraph, I must warn you not to watch open room's auction and play in the next board|pg||
nt|Gerben42: helpful lead|pg||
nt|Gerben42: can make 5@H 5@S 3@D now|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: the question if 3H shows shape as well or can be x H |pg||
mb|p|nt|babydolldk: Yes, maybe difficult for w to play a @D...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: E not happy with partner's bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: in open  east bid 5h in front of partner against 5dims partner may have found a different action|pg||

nt|poohbear: once again we see Ruso fail to bid at a cheap level|pg||
nt|poohbear: not clear this Dbl will excite partner enuff|pg||
nt|kaapo: Mostly to expose psychs like this 1@S by Arvidsson|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: expose he did. find the right level he didnt|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Ouch|pg||
nt|sybarra: I play it with a european pard |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: This is going to be bloody|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: The final bid optimum and correct|pg||

nt|lestergold: ten tricks easy on that route|pg||
nt|MolvaM: deklaran yeri görünce pik vale sorunum var diye düþünecek ama biz biliyoruz ki sorunu yok :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, need to duck the spade opening lead and made some good guessing later|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I dont understand one club opeing for Latvia|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: Dummy walked away (wisely)|pg||

nt|kastan88: 'assume|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: right|pg||

pc|s5|nt|MolvaM: açýktan 3 imp verip ataðý geri almak mümkün olabilmeli bence|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C was forcing with clubs, since he is GF he chose to show clubs instead of hearts to establish the force|pg||
nt|tomi2: so they were in a forcing situation and double by Sikora is a suggestion to play there|pg||

nt|kaapo: On 7, the Swedish pair is at 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I must say, X was a coward's bid! lol|pg||

nt|tomi2: Toke Hoffmeister just turned 17 I was told|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: That's double pool right there o.O|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: so a chance for Greece to pull it back to close|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|lestergold: this contract depends basically on which hand the hearts are played from|pg||
nt|lestergold: the natural play of a heart up to the KQ loses of course|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D sets up GF with 5+@D|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: It most definitely is, pd is 6-10 (usually)|pg||

nt|gh1: not so good 4s, but maybee not x|pg||
nt|rodal f: An X will cost at the 4|pg||
nt|Gerben42: even 3N making is 17 imps|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lestergold: i mean who is going to play a heart tghe other way then losing the chance of finessing against the tenof hearts if th hearts break 4/1 the other way|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3 nt with lots of chances after the @c lead and the king wins|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@S is either a 4 dard suit, or a hand like this missing a @H stopper or strong (18+) with spades|pg||
nt|gracelin: they found their best contract.|pg||
nt|kastan88: NS play some 5-card Majors, better minors, (14)15-17 NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: let's see|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no 5 diam or clubs ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: so they chose to play 4@S, this does not need hearts to break 4-3 but has some other dangers|pg||
nt|kaapo: This lead presents a trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|babydolldk: On board 7 they bid 6@C|pg||
nt|raghavan: But if 2D is both Majors - the hand must be a real opening hand - or else difficult for respondaseer to judge - as in this c|pg||
nt|davidb: should misgueese all to go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4@H is cold on any lead|pg||
nt|kaapo: And also an entry to the North hand, unless East playes low, as he did|pg||
nt|yuval10: a slight overbidding by NS here...|pg||
nt|yuval10: N probably thought S has more for his X and 2@h|pg||
nt|yuval10: but the lucky position in the @c suit might enable it through|pg||
pc|d5|nt|poohbear: maybe best to win the @c and return a @c immediately|pg||
nt|tomi2: 17 IMPs for Germany if they make and 19 if not, so the whole play is like fighting for overticks|pg||
nt|Gerben42: just got confirmation Tomi, just turned 17|pg||

nt|yuval10: will have 2 entries for it with the K@d and the @s ruff|pg||

nt|gracelin: In a bidding challenge they will surely get the top mark by choosing 4S|pg||
nt|tomi2: in fact 3nt will make most of the times, because hearts can also split badly but block or ... if you bid 3nt fast they might lead something else, say the leader has Kx in hearts ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: and partner AQxxx|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, but after heart weakness exposed, I like Sikora's choice|pg||
nt|tomi2: sure|pg||

nt|gracelin: a good result for Norway in the closed room|pg||

nt|kaapo: His partner won with @DQ - but the 8 was difficult to read|pg||
nt|kaapo: So instead of taking the ace and giving a ruff, he shifted to hearts and the declarer has a chance|pg||

mb|p|nt|raghavan: Ns have majority of points = South's 1NT +10 points with N normally should go down - |pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s9|nt|gracelin: 7c is a good proposition if West has Kxx of clubs instead|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C is alerted because they respond 2@C also on balanced hands even with spade fit, so it could be on 2 cards only|pg||
nt|gracelin: so only 4C confirmed the club fit|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2nt is forcing and 3@C confirms some support|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@C confirms the fit, 4@H is a cuebid|pg||

nt|tomi2: 4nt = 1 or 4 keycards in clubs|pg||

nt|marlowepi: welcome michael|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm not saying that, Michael ... I say it shows some light opening bid with a good suit.|pg||
nt|robinswr: no 4th seat preempts say that you think you have plays for game but not for slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|scotty: right , but since you think partner needs to know which values are important, it must mean that you deny singleton or void|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|robinswr: when in doubt, vulnerable, bid game and let them try to beat you. I tought that to meckwell which is why they are winning |pg||
nt|marlowepi: sounds logical|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|scotty: Exactly - so the whole club-diamond-spade value thing is irrelevant|pg||
nt|kareno: Not my idea of a 2nt bid - two card diversity ... you'll end up in a 4-2 fit too often.|pg||
nt|robinswr: just a guess and how is partner supposed to know|pg||

nt|sybarra2: taking small break here folks  not to worry |pg||

nt|yuval10: looks like a very good results for Sweden in the OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: You specs arent paying attn . usually 20 people jump on me :P|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess the limits are 4S for NS and 5D for EW|pg||

nt|kaapo: Ah, 4@S 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@S can have longer @D|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@S is alerted because a) it can have longer @D and b) it can be on 3 cards sometimes|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|poohbear: in my opinion|pg||

nt|poohbear: are they playing a Polish style system Adrian?|pg||

mb|p|nt|davidb: probably W knows his partners agressive jumps -if not 4sp is ok nv|pg||
nt|davidb: A h & h looks safe vs 3-2 in trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: and that would also make 3NT an easy bid by South|pg||
nt|ritong: this hand seems to be a matter of undertrick(s)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d a bit enthusiastic|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: holding 3 good spades and 2 bad hearts this system allows you to bid 1@S and partner rightside NT contract - but he can also find out later about your 3 cards if he has a strong ...|pg||

nt|kaapo: 2NT denies 4c majors, and probably also denies 5-card minors|pg||
nt|kaapo: 3@S shows 5|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 3NT shows 2 @S|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C forced 2@D to show a sign off in @D or some stronger hands|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C forces 2@D, but maybe there is a case for bidding 2@H here, since so many @D fit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: A great result for Sweden |pg||
nt|yuval10: reasonable bidding, yes still a big swing in favour of Sweden|pg||
nt|yuval10: *yet|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and a nice recovery after 0-48 after 6 boards|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hedyg: Grosset needs to unblock|pg||
nt|kaapo: This shows a draw back in 2-way Stayman|pg||
nt|kaapo: Since West hasn't got 4@H nor 5 cards in a minor...|pg||
nt|kaapo: And he has 2@S...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Wow, I wish I could pen X at the 1-level lol|pg||

pc|c8|pg||
nt|charles_l: find the @cQ for 3N|pg||
nt|raghavan: breather given by defense|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3NT shouldnt be too difficult . Declarer prob just unblocks spades and ducks a @c|pg||
nt|poohbear: and falls back on the @d finesse if @cs dont break|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: and thx Rob cu all  soon|pg||
nt|ritong: why would he?:)|pg||
nt|kaapo: We (and the defence) know his full shape: 2-3-4-4|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|kaapo: This appears to be going down now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphztr: thinking|pg||
nt|hedyg: because when he stops to think he either had a stiff K@C or is thinking to switch|pg||
pc|d6|nt|raghavan: He should have ducked first D |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|raghavan: not good defense|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|robinswr: when there is a singleton in dummy, the normal signal is suit preferance |pg||
mb|1S|nt|kareno: Middle encourages, no, Steve?  High and low suit pref.|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: yes|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: That is how most play it.|pg||
nt|scotty: I think most experts would lead a heart from the S hand - combining thought of major and not giving away trick or tempo|pg||
nt|kareno: Needs less from partner to help also.|pg||
nt|scotty: Against 1N-3n, you might find some spade leaders|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and most would bid with the S hand if nonvul i think|pg||
nt|robinswr: or some diamond leaders|pg||
nt|robinswr: good lead problem for 1nt 3nt|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|scotty: But if partner has nothing in the suit you lead, a spade might well turn out better, if E has both honors or W has Hx.  But I would lead a heart|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: Two more boards now & then, for the last 2 sessions, the Lynch lineup will change.|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: good partner has the at least the jack|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree that a heart looks normal, but it might be instructive to run a simulation. one of the downsides of the heart lead is that you have so much stuff pd will have one big card ...|pg||

nt|kastan88: 1@C= 11-14 bal or 441@D4 or 17+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|sybarra2: in comparison e/w will say:  we took the early save" |pg||

nt|yuval10: can W fins the excellent @s lead? not likely, i'd say|pg||
nt|yuval10: *finds|pg||
pc|h2|nt|poohbear: I guess the Russians are playing a Polish type system otherwise North really shouldnt pass 1H|pg||
nt|syl: good chance to declare 2@H in both rooms...|pg||
nt|syl: but here S reopened|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: lol|pg||
pc|h4|nt|tomi2: my experience is that Dutch schools player are all very fast, so if you play average tempo you are "slow" :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Haha, I guess we do|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|mariner1: we have a back and forth match going here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N a very reasonable spot|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C = Precision style, 2@S = hearts, 2NT natural i guess|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in Open Room are in a tough 3N here|pg||
nt|athene: i would think this is the sort of game you stumble into more often than not|pg||
nt|athene: east opens and west just decides to force to game|pg||
nt|athene: with the good heart suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes and it would be tough to bring 9 in I think|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: they play natural|pg||

nt|hedyg: is Lorenzini/Grosset a new partnership? i seem to rember Lorenzini used to play with another partner|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu 2 kör cevabu kör ataðýný önlemek bakýmýndan iyi|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C was likely strong (or Polish), and 1@D negative|pg||
nt|kaapo: South has some @S support and a hand that is pretty maximum for 1@D|pg||
nt|kaapo: So he might find another call|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Any time I play with my father, and I mess up, he says "Look at the clock, we've got another 8/30 minutes left! Take longer!"|pg||

nt|hedyg: he is indeed, even if he misguessed the @ds here|pg||
nt|tomi2: E could have ducked the @CA but decl was favorite to get the clubs right anyway because of the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: France and Norway going strong at the top of the table. However, this is just round 12 of 22, so many things can happen|pg||
nt|yuval10: 8@c call for a @s return|pg||
pc|d4|nt|eerbil: Güney ilk trefli almasa defans biraz daha kolay olabilirdi|pg||
nt|sybarra2: never to see dummy again |pg||
pc|d8|nt|davidb: good bidding by EW . play should not be a problem|pg||
nt|poohbear: no reason to overruff when there is a loser to pitch|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes if you play both suit "with the odds" then you lose, but I think N did not bid his 5 cards in the OR, so E lead a heart and I guess W shoed his count|pg||
pc|s6|nt|poohbear: EW needed totake the @d ace before plying the @c|pg||
nt|syl: crossruffing may be superior|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=12&qshowflag=1|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Israel coming strongly from behind after a very poor start|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: @HQ lead in the other room solved a lot of problems for declarer|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|babydolldk: last chance|pg||
nt|raghavan: HK and a Heart may be a good defense|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: director calls for half time|pg||
nt|charles_l: but may decidwe to play N for @dQ10xx? instead of @c10?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ms Hoderova again pondering her next move|pg||
nt|charles_l: no- too much for 1@d response i think|pg||
nt|raghavan: Probably they are playing - In VuGraph delayed presentation|pg||
nt|babydolldk: when is it wrong to play @H's now?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: wrong there|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: we are very much live|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ok Tx VuGraph Op|pg||
nt|athene: and the nice club lie didn't hurt|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: and now?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|poohbear: safe to play the spade now|pg||

nt|poohbear: anything else is risking the contract|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mariner1: I expected England to gain here and instead they will lose a big swing|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Hungary and Poland making short work of Denmark and Romania respectively|pg||

nt|hedyg: much needed imps to Italy|pg||
nt|ritong: right, heavy score til now|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and sliding home to 1 @S |pg||
nt|yuval10: vs Turkey and against Sweden|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: i think many people do lead partner's suit too often - a lot of experts avoid it and look for something unexpected if opps bid confidently to 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: for example there was a hand in the finals of the US trials a few weeks back|pg||
nt|athene: when rodwell overcalled 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: and meckstroth led a heart from @HQJxx instead of a spade|pg||

nt|poohbear: this will likely be another Russian pickup|pg||
nt|ritong: this is interesting about the overcall|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer is under no pressure in 4H.  But if he were in slam, the normal way is to go wrong in both major suits|pg||
nt|tomi2: with qxx in spades lindqwist is not likely to lead singleton Q in 6@S|pg||
nt|kaapo: Meanwhile, Latvia has scored some IMPs on boards 9 and 10|pg||
nt|kaapo: So, is the East hand still a weak/mini 1NT, or 1@D?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: E has left the table|pg||

nt|kaapo: I suppose it's simple enough to understand, even to those who cannot read Swedish|pg||

nt|raghavan: Deal 10 3NT 1 down here. Open room 4S = 12 IMP |pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S does play a trick better likely|pg||
nt|ritong: hm|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice to play unsual vs unusual and be able to bid a nf 3@s here|pg||
nt|ritong: wild shot id say|pg||
nt|hedyg: junior bid?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@d seems to be on|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: who's thinking?:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: even 6?|pg||
nt|hedyg: always Grosset :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: now is hard|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|davidb: every card is ok for NS  for 11 tricks in H . |pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: with the lucky @cs he should be able to make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: how about N bidding 5@C instead of 5@d, showing force in @c and fit in 1 of the reds?|pg||
nt|kaapo: In a diamond contract a major suit ruff would bring it to 12|pg||
nt|tomi2: in all junior competitions you have a bi difference between the best players and the "newcommers" Jassem and Tuczynski playing for Polish schools won that event already 2 years ago ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: and are playing in first Polish league. They are very experienced and good players while there are lots of teams with players who only play Bridge for one or two years and don't ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: have as much training as others have, so we will see lots of 25-x scores this week|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The Swedes did well to choose NT in the other room. 4@H is in jeopardy|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 4@h will manage, def. doesn't have communication|pg||
mb|2H|nt|poohbear: dbl now|pg||
nt|poohbear: get the @hs in|pg||
nt|kaapo: But the 4-1 break is akward|pg||
nt|kaapo: At least if South leads the singleton @C|pg||
nt|rodal f: A practic bid:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: E may sac in 4@s over 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I like this kind of bidding:)|pg||
nt|gh1: i think 4s-1 with right def, and spade switch fore -1|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: You're right there, Thomas :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|poohbear: Especially if EW can bid 2NT scramble |pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@d is a game try|pg||
nt|poohbear: South should reject|pg||
nt|ritong: declarer needs five @c tricks, he will find them whatever his choice so big hit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Montanari sees no defensive tricks vs 6@D.....|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he might bid 6@s|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nope|pg||
nt|eerbil: bu kadar öndeyken alýþveriþ ihtimali düþük eller gelmesi hoþ biþey|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: N sure has a lot to be passing 3@D|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, particularly when he holds @sAK, his pard very likely has an 8 bagger|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=733&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1 for running scores in the Schools series|pg||
nt|tomi2: this looks like an interesting spot they have reached now|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: West will pass |pg||
nt|davidb: if N is short in Sp , S hand is not so good . ok to pass Nv'  |pg||
nt|hedyg: would have been -4|pg||
nt|hedyg: Grosset "the thinker" might take a while to play this|pg||
nt|ritong: he has no real alternative|pg||
nt|rodal f: Need @S returne for set the contract NOW|pg||
mb|p|pc|d9|nt|charles_l: if Z rebid 4@s it might go ppp...?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ms. Hoderova is playing the bartender now|pg||
nt|raghavan: N should try spade ruffs before drawing trumps |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: has left the table in order to procure drinks|pg||
nt|tomi2: west chose to pass 2@H - it's quite popular in Poland a) to upgrade lots of 14's to 1NT and b) to superaccept on maximum and 3 cards support - so he chose to pass 2@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2H is probably making.  Nice stop by Sikora |pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer will promote the 4th @s to discard a @c, and ruff @d in dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, West could have led a diamond against 3NT I suppose, but he chose his own suit, clubs. Not such a good idea|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|vugraphztm: S thinking.......|pg||
nt|syl: bold bid this 3nt|pg||
nt|gracelin: unless declarer misguessed D after north ruffs club and return a low D.|pg||
nt|kaapo: North has only 3 hearts, so after (taking @H finesse and) ruffing a @H, EW can draw trumps and then raise the @S trick|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Bech explains to Lauks that his part's hand is a REALLY bad 13|pg||
nt|sybarra2: take no finesses.... |pg||
nt|tomi2: since W made no negative double E should have good spades for his offer to play 4@S. W with Hxx and @H shortnes can pass maybe|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@h is a counter Game try|pg||
nt|poohbear: perhaps North should accept that|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@D was an artificial GF|pg||
nt|kaapo: And I suppose 3NT means what Florin told|pg||
nt|kaapo: This should go 1 down|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mariner1: @H lead helps declarer|pg||
nt|hedyg: that helps!|pg||
nt|sybarra2: bang down aces and kings  |pg||
pc|h2|nt|mariner1: probably always makes 5 though|pg||
nt|athene: south has bid north's hand for him here|pg||
nt|athene: north passed 3@D and then bid only 3@S over the second double|pg||
nt|athene: saying "I don't have anything, partner!"|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=5|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I could claim but who knows..:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL better not|pg||
nt|hedyg: no operator claims :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Grosset is .... thinking:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ofc|pg||
nt|ritong: sometimes they get bored and have fun trying to anticipate the matters  not always a success:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
pc|h7|nt|MolvaM: bu elde önemi yok ama kuzeyin pik 8li dönmesi iyi bir oyun|pg||
nt|gh1: now last chance fore spade|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think 4@S is better than 5@D, esp. on this @D layout|pg||
nt|tomi2: Hoffmeister has already bid 4@D, if he wanted to run out of 4@S maybe he should have offered 5@C to let partner decide the final contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps his p could've halped him by doubling 2@d|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=3&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|mariner1: -  Running Scores (Refresh Often)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Nice said Mr. Osipov|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphztm: bd.13 was fault|pg||
nt|gracelin: did C9 call for spade ?|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes but nopbody leads from Q into jx when xxx in spades is also available|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kaapo: I held a elementary bridge class a while back, and I kind of remember the book stating something about 33 HCPs for a slam|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kaapo: So perhaps Bech could've settled for 3NT|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra2: easy from here of course|pg||
nt|yuval10: which he didn't, according to the movie|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|athene: south raised to 4@S, saying "don't lie, i know you have lots really!"|pg||
nt|athene: and south was indeed correct|pg||
nt|ritong: then " undo" "undo" "undo", "sorry" "sorry" "sorry" etc|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and apparently easy at the table:)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphztr: everyone's having a laugh|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gracelin: yes, there is no discard available for declarer, so north will just sit back with DQ|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kaapo: Or pehaps he could bid somthing to suggest a minor suit contract, say 4NT or 5NT?|pg||
nt|tomi2: Rusch could also have 5 clubs and 4 spades for his bidding|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: the cups are tiny|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hedyg: when a @c comes from W he can claim|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|mariner1: now the @c loser is gone|pg||
pc|s7|nt|tomi2: while North maybe could have doubled holding some 1.5 trump tricks and an ace and seeing they had problems in their auction, I think he will win more often then lose those 4 imps ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: for =|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|poohbear: not clear what declarer should do but he is going for the @d break|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|hedyg: got pushed into a very lucky slam!|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kaapo: Ah, Bech had only 3@C|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: Vincent taking the @D7 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: In defense too|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Ernst just took a bathroom break|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|mariner1: 1@C Polish @c|pg||
nt|poohbear: it was indeed 7 to Russia on the 1@h hand. NS played 3@c in the other room. That was 2 high|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, some players play cards very fast - some don't place their card clearly enough on the table (or the screen hides it)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 2@H seems to be the (in)famous Muiderberg, as we call it, 5@H, 4+m|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|davidb: 1Nt opening 14-16 won the prevoious board|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D perhaps an underbid in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: five trumps and an ace...maybe worth 4@D|pg||
nt|athene: wld be nicer with two spades and the stiff in hearts, admittedly|pg||
nt|athene: (or that's what north probably thought) :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers asking for 6@D here|pg||
nt|kaapo: The South hand here seems to me at least as good as the one North opened 1@C on  13|pg||
nt|kaapo: Even though it has 1 HCP less.|pg||
nt|kaapo: Now, in a limited opening system...|pg||
nt|kaapo: South might have a was to show a maximum opening with 6@H and 3@S|pg||
nt|kaapo: Like 2NT|pg||
nt|kaapo: *way (instead of was)|pg||
nt|kaapo: This might be yet another case for 3NT with a good 6-card major|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: which probably he cant remember now as he is staring at the (very high) ceiling|pg||
nt|sybarra2: muiderberg or funky tartan?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 2NT asking which m|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: anyway, grosset is " cricri" on BBO and i can say that he is a super nice guy|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: 3NT is on NS any lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: and now is the time to bid it|pg||
nt|gracelin: Now a lucky grand slam bid by Norway in open room|pg||
nt|othered1: we can see if it gets in the way of a constructive auction|pg||
nt|sybarra2: E pleased to hear it is @C |pg||
pc|d2|nt|charles_l: i think 4@h is a practical bid - not dbl|pg||
nt|poohbear: Ruso should lie by dbling if she feels obligated to bid|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: i would have opened a 20-21 2NT with the 2 10s and 9@d|pg||
nt|usla: matchpoints dbl in OR, saka style:)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sorunsuz|pg||
nt|tomi2: just getting some bets that polish players wont bid the grand, but my experience against sikora and nawrocki is that they will :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mariner1: 2N shows the bid hand with little @c help as he has|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: !!|pg||
nt|poohbear: She rebid 3@h?|pg||
nt|poohbear: would think she would be thrilled to raise NT|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and now Mr. Osipov.... pass:)|pg||
nt|ritong: the fact that he takes his time playing this important event is rather a good thing, i add|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure it is|pg||
nt|ozgull: düz bir el daha|pg||
nt|tokay1975: bu elide cozduler pastan gelen ortaga  dbl muthis|pg||
nt|tokay1975: kesinlikle pas derdim ben alakam olmazdi|pg||
nt|kaapo: So 3@H now could either show exactly 3@S - or deny 3@S. South just doesn't know which :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit passive by E? 2@C as bid for anyone?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: shaka style= 5 clubs:)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|charles_l: unless 4m=m+@h|pg||
nt|babydolldk: if you play leaping michaels maybe 4@C...|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt showed the strong version of 1@C? what wld south do with the weak NT? pass 2@C?|pg||
nt|gracelin: Sikora may still regret on  11 when they stopped in 6C but trump K was onside for seven.|pg||
nt|andy_h: Not much to this hand, with the diamonds breaking.|pg||
nt|andy_h: And of course N is going to lead his shortest major to hit partner's suit|pg||
pc|d4|nt|babydolldk: :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: good decision by N 4SX goes 2 down VUL -500 where as now only 450|pg||
nt|charles_l: between dbl & 4@h, guys?|pg||
nt|babydolldk: D|pg||
nt|mariner1: Q10 @D comes down so this will not take long|pg||
nt|kastan88: disaster in Open Roome here, after quite similar bidding as here, IMO North can't bid 3NT with only 1 stopper, double much solid decision,|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|tomi2: Sikora is a gabmler and Nawrocki not so when West has the final decision to make...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: good lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep:)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|gracelin: 7D makes on 2-2 diamonds or singleton Q, altgether about 52.5% chance|pg||
nt|kaapo: Although, of course they may not have that kind of agreement at alk|pg||
pc|h7|nt|poohbear: This will not do well|pg||
nt|tomi2: 7@D always makes when Sikor is playing and Qxx(x) is not offside ;)|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am sure he won't go wrong here.  That's a safety bet.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: 4 @h = cue at this point |pg||
nt|sybarra2: (just a guess) |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Johansen just explained it as such|pg||
nt|othered1: Now has to find the @CQ.  Never got their good @S fit in, however.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|MolvaM: demek sen de yaþlýsýn tokay|pg||
nt|othered1: There goes the @C guess|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ok now found? |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|tokay1975: ole gozukuyo:))|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: e n-am fost atent|pg||
nt|gracelin: Nawrocki adopted the scientfic approach by asking trump Q|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mariner1: yes he would have to as 2@C was not forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: now claim 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: now you can shorten matters cricri|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: only 7 looser|pg||
pc|s7|nt|tokay1975: 100  sayi yazar giderdik biz|pg||
nt|gracelin: thedenial|pg||
nt|andy_h: W will duck a heart, in the (off?) chance that S has preempted with 7 of them and diamonds don't break - then he can take finesses into the non-danger hand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|MolvaM: son 5 borda giriyoruz|pg||
nt|kastan88: Now South had to decide to leave 3@S doubled or look for minor contract (that he mentioned with good-bad 2NT)...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I think is not a classical good / bad NT|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kastan88: yes, but similar their|pg||
nt|kastan88: *there|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: just claim the reds :)|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: he claim too|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg: i must say i am very impressed in general with the quality played by all these juniors|pg||
nt|hedyg: junior bridge nowadays is good!|pg||
nt|tomi2: hmm lost my bet :(|pg||
nt|tomi2: but sikora will find the @DQ anyway so i was kind of right|pg||
nt|gracelin: Sikora can't be sure that partner has four trumps, otherwise he knows the only problem was trump Q and he would find it.|pg||
nt|kaapo: Spade loser goes on a @D so this is as good as 3NT as it is|pg||
nt|sybarra2: who leads from qxx?  or x of @C on this auction |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphztr: they are thinking and I'm sleeping (a little bit) :)|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h3|nt|charles_l: if i D then 4@h i expect W to move with @sA and @hQ10x|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kastan88: good play from West here, he must put declarer under pressure at once, another way dias will be thrown on good hearts|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit more aktivity at the other room so X came natural|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|usla: after 3 @C pre W hand count what tricks?|pg||
nt|rodal f: U can ask:) Was a hard one|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: so % clubs better over 1spade?:):)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: '5 clubs'|pg||
pc|d5|nt|poohbear: 3 NT would have depended on North's choice of leads|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: when his partner doesn't raise spades, and opps go for 3nt, west knows there's no future in spades|pg||
nt|athene: hence the heart lead|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|sybarra2: making waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay  too many |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h9|nt|tomi2: North was squeezed in this trick|pg||
pc|s6|pc|hA|nt|athene: spade lead "to see dummy" might give away a crucial tempo in some layouts, allowing declarer to get his @SJ10xx or so set up|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes the @H was in fact a good try|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|poohbear: Prob gets it right but his partner might not on a low @c lead. Might play the 10 . SHOULDNT since declarer is marked for the jack when he doesnt play Q|pg||

nt|raghavan: should be in 4H or 3NT|pg||
nt|davidb: E can find a way to 10 tricks if not playing all spades |pg||
nt|kaapo: The Latvians made 3NT on  13 so the gap got smaller there|pg||
nt|kaapo: And they found 6@D|pg||
nt|kaapo: So now we're where we began: 0-0|pg||
nt|kaapo: EW might end up at 3@C here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 5 more boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: are you undersaying that it used not to be ?:)|pg||
nt|othered1: trump leads at 5-level, like at small slam, better be right, since you seldom have lots of time to change your plans|pg||
nt|andy_h: Netherlands trying to pile up the small plusses|pg||
nt|andy_h: They need whatever they can get|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Too late for that now :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well 3N did make in Open Room, its not a lay down|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D shows a major suit here|pg||
nt|hedyg: i believe it better nowadays than it used be say 20 or 30 years ago|pg||
nt|ritong: mm..|pg||
nt|hedyg: remembering your junior days Henri?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: at this table they play a very good and NATURAL bridge|pg||
nt|ritong: somewhat|pg||
nt|yuval10: N passed here, might be significent if EW will bid to 4@s|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|athene: it's all very well to double these artificial bids to show "cards"|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|athene: but the critical thing is what your subsequent actions mean|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2nt?|pg||
nt|kaapo: If East had opened 1@S, that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i.e. what does double mean?|pg||
nt|yuval10: the 1@s in the OR helped the Italians to bid to the easy 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: is a new suit forcing or non-forcing?|pg||
nt|athene: if you haven't discussed these things, you are often worse-off after the first double|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: pass?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ritong: but internet is a gigantic booster, nowadays|pg||
nt|hedyg: XX showing Hx in @s?|pg||
nt|tokay1975: gencler uyanik akarken dolduralim diyorlar|pg||
nt|gracelin: poland might score another game swing here.  Tough for NS t reach 4H after the 1NT response|pg||
nt|gracelin: North plans to bid H then spade to show his 3-suiter|pg||
nt|tomi2: I like Zatorskis 1@H bid, he is the player who bids 3 card suits and underleads aces more often than me :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: and let south decide the final contract|pg||
nt|kaapo: I'm not a fan of 1NT openings on 5M-4m hands|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: !!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: south can raise to 3H when already denied a 4-card major|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: !!!|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|vugraphztr: very good players here|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would take 2@S here as showing values|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2S might show a minimum|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I wonder what 1@S is|pg||
nt|yuval10: already starts very interesting, 1@s perhaps one long suit|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think it is suction perhaps: @c or @h and @d|pg||
mb|d|nt|davidb: S  is very guite today  NV 2H is ok|pg||
nt|davidb: 5 D is makable still (club 3-3 ) |pg||
nt|hedyg: yes it certainly is. Juniors are much more exposed to international bridge|pg||
nt|ritong: being able to watch almost all of the best play on the planet everyday or so is unvaluable for these youngsters|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu el pek rahat deðil bence. depo doldurma operayonu açýsýndan|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: pass at 1 sp rdbl?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Many Swedes play what they call "Häxan", which is a close relative to Gazilli|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 1@S-1NT-2@C would not be natural|pg||
nt|kastan88: 2NT!= transfer to diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: and N decided to leave it which must indicate that he has many @s's|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|raghavan: good lead for declarer|pg||
nt|gracelin: it's alerted.|pg||
nt|othered1: Things are extremely friendly for a @H game here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can become a funny board|pg||

mb|p|nt|ozgull: sistemlerinde 5 li h dengesiz davet|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2pik tek mi gösterdi?|pg||
nt|tokay1975: sanmam  2sp davet edicem birazdan gibi biseydi|pg||
nt|MolvaM: dengesiz olduðunu gördüm de daveti geremedim daha.  bakýyorum|pg||
nt|eerbil: bence 2nt kýsalýk sordu, 3@h de pik kýsa demek|pg||
nt|ozgull: 8 puan olunca zaten zon diyorlar:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not necessarily at these colours. North could pass with anything NV vs Vul|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hedyg: best lead|pg||
nt|gracelin: then 3D sign-off, unless north has extra.|pg||
nt|gracelin: looking at thse NS hands, I am not sure I want to be in 4H|pg||
nt|tomi2: but then you should not think that long|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: amazing:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: The other room are in 3NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|raghavan: gets a OT|pg||
nt|kaapo: Parhaps that fact made East think it's better to open 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: I don't really know their system, all speculating.|pg||
nt|tomi2: this time partner has a prime hand, but every time he bids a game with a worse one and it makes, opps call TD and claim that thinking long for bidding 2@S suggest more then really ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: J@C coming down is key here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hayýrlýsý|pg||
nt|tokay1975: koz cýkýsna  3h olmaz|pg||
nt|MolvaM: delikanlý adam koz çýkmaz|pg||
nt|eerbil: gördüðümüz kadarý ile @d rua normal atak :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: evet @DK þablon|pg||
nt|Walddk4: as long as they are undoubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: nice spot for NS|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 3nt  iyi aslýnda  bati dusunebilir 3nt demeyi|pg||
nt|eerbil: herhalde benim tahminim gibi deðil anlaþmalarý, çünkü öyle olsa erdem 3nt derdi|pg||
nt|begse: 3nt düþünmeli mutlaka|pg||
nt|tokay1975: herhangi bi davete o el 3nt dusunebilir|pg||
nt|tokay1975: cokda onemli diil ne daveti 6li h davette olsa|pg||
nt|gracelin: Indeed, and screen doesn't help here. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not a double to be proud of|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk4: why give the show away?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|charles_l: luckily only OTs at stake|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gracelin: the normal CQ lead will beat this|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|begse: ne olsa 3nt demek ya kendi lövem var ya kör tutuyorum demek|pg||

nt|rodal f: Best spot from Simonsen I belive, but need to find the 10th|pg||
nt|yuval10: not at all...but appearently was hopping that P can deliver at least 1 trick|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|tomi2: i think a cross ruff and later exit might help|pg||
nt|othered1: we can see 11 tricks, but declarer is looking for the safest 10|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|tokay1975: evet|pg||
nt|tokay1975: cevapci hala 4h der isterse|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer might still make this with a cross ruff line and some intereesting ending|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Emma can and probably should make it after she has been told that spades break 5-0|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c5|pc|sJ|nt|poohbear: now declare will play @ds|pg||

nt|athene: Jones hoping to endplay north|pg||
nt|mariner1: well done push,,,,,,|pg||
nt|mariner1: seems making 5 here is easy enough,|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bence bu maçta özellikle açýk odada oynayan çiftimiz þehmuz ve mehmet güney güzel bir skor kaðýdý getirdiler|pg||
nt|tomi2: well played!|pg||
nt|gracelin: Nice play.  Bye all|pg||
nt|othered1: As shown, wasn't that only 10 tricks (@D, @C and @H off?)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Next board are 4@S at W|pg||
nt|rodal f: In the other room|pg||
nt|andy_h: Double partscore swing - reducing the deficit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: On the previous deal, note the nice @SJ discard by N, and then leading a @S to hand. Tough for W now to take the A with KQ in dummy|pg||
nt|yuval10: so the technical problems appearently caused some mess|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's somoething that of course is out of hand of everybody involving|pg||
nt|yuval10: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Results.htm|pg||
nt|yuval10: for running scores from this event|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: srry I have big problems here....|pg||
nt|yuval10: click on Juniors or schools for the event you want to see|pg||
nt|yuval10: np, it happenes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We are closer to the truth now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hard to see that this will create a swing|pg||
nt|liviu123: bord 13  |pg||
nt|yuval10: yes, it's the problem , but the result here is correct|pg||
nt|liviu123: board 13 is another score|pg||
nt|yuval10: however, OR made it wrong, as 3@d was actu ally down 1|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1NT making was the correct score, so we might want to ask the operator of the Open Room for the right result in board 13|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 17 already played|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 77-35 is the score after 17|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: must be in 4S|pg||
nt|gracelin: oh, there are more boards.|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1H - 2NT - P - 4@S|pg||
nt|gh1: problem with club lead in 4s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will kill y|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: how?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|charles_l: 4@s here|pg||
nt|babydolldk: 5@D -3 best defense|pg||
nt|raghavan: Charles - Has S gone to get u Red wine??|pg||
nt|babydolldk: 'defence|pg||
nt|poohbear: ble if you get there|pg||
nt|hedyg: hard to play @c instead of A@d when pd asked for @d|pg||
nt|MolvaM: arda ve erdem ise iniþli çýkýþlý gittiler ama net bilançolarý artý'da bence|pg||
nt|tomi2: yeah Europans are 20 boards each wihle World Championships are 16 boards and also 3 segments|pg||
nt|kaapo: Another nebulour 1@D here|pg||
nt|kaapo: *nebulous|pg||
nt|gh1: must play dia too k then|pg||
nt|rodal f: Miss a trow at the 3. @C honor|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: :) hope so\|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no, she kept moving her thumb from 1@s to 2|pg||
nt|raghavan: If W does not bid D now, no future D contract|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 4major+1 is the most common boring flat board by a long way|pg||
nt|MolvaM: açýk odada birisi kontr demeyi unutmuþ. çok iyi skor|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@S - pass - pass - dbl?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|MolvaM: bu 5 kör deklaresine ne buyrulur?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: batarý olmayan kontratý 1 atýþta buldu Erdem|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ah, West bid 1NT|pg||
nt|kaapo: I'm glad I didn't buy a lottery ticket today ;)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@D is around 11-15 if unbalanced or 13-16 balanced|pg||
nt|kaapo: So East is quite maximal and might find a move|pg||
nt|kaapo: I suppose Bethers isn't thinking, but Arvidsson|pg||
nt|othered1: Game in either pointed suit is possible NS, but may not be easy to handle|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: just needs K@C in pocket (and reasonable @S and other breaks) for slam|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@s is comfortable 5 is not|pg||
nt|poohbear: but it will make|pg||
nt|tokay1975: ben katýlýyorum 4h x bole bi el ifade edemez  ehveni ser cok begendim b|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hmm arda kötü þeyler düþünüyor|pg||

nt|MolvaM: kontru düþün arda baþka þeyleri boþver|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nop, N was|pg||
nt|po-s: perhaps Bech should have thought|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: clearly you shdnt buy that ticket|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D seems to be w2 in one major, and south hopes for more than those jacks in partners hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: which means that this will be flat|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
nt|mariner1: not likely to be slam hunting on 10 opposite 16|pg||
nt|athene: south might get interested now|pg||
nt|syl: w may dble this|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: W dreaming of KQ spade & A cl for a slam|pg||
nt|athene: but it's a bit pushy facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5@c is exclusion RKCB asking for aces but NOT the @c ace|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c non gf|pg||
nt|tomi2: I prefere 20 boards - we are playing championships, so why play 48 boards a day only...|pg||
nt|kastan88: 1@C = 11...14 bal or 441@D4 or 17+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or as Terje Lie say. 10 always. Will get a @H ruff might|pg||
mb|3C|nt|raghavan: E has passed |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: (after consulting CC)|pg||
nt|gracelin: Ok, will stay on. Can't miss this slam hand.|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hejssan PO|pg||
nt|po-s: hej|pg||
nt|kaapo: You'd have passed as West?|pg||
nt|gh1: ggod lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's a bold prediction, Roland :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: yep but ...|pg||
nt|poohbear: so a misunderstanding and finally I get to say a possible pickup for my friends from Croatia :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Maybe Davor is here:):)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: & Zvonimir:)|pg||
nt|tokay1975: obur taraftan onunda tedbir etmesi lazim 6h yapamicaklari acik rakibin deklarasyonundan  esit zon durumunda|pg||
nt|tokay1975: x diyebilir teklif gibi  dayanabiliyosan birak dayanamiyosan 6h de |pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: showing an acol style 2@d opening with the 3@d bid|pg||
nt|ritong: this shouyld not survive|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, not on a @s lead..|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 2Diam GF & 2Cl semiforcing|pg||
nt|ritong: unless west tries to have a glance at dummy|pg||
nt|tokay1975: ama pas  demeside kabul edebilir|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it will be on a finesse at best if partner has the perfect @HA @CAJ|pg||
nt|mariner1: and E might have an important card too, and does here with K@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: well S should win A@C and pull @S and lead a @c|pg||
nt|athene: @CA, draw trumps|pg||
nt|poohbear: Who are they?|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D confirms the strong variant of polish club and asks partner for further information|pg||
nt|tomi2: 3@C confirmed 5 hearts and some extras, 3@H sets trumps and starts slam investigation|pg||
nt|po-s: absolutely - East has max 15|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like it's going to be easier than I thought|pg||
nt|tomi2: nice lead here found by hoffmeister although a small club would be nice too ;)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|davidb: E showing min - W gave up. flat|pg||
nt|davidb: " new york syndrom "|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose he might play low on the basis that even @CK, club ruff, diamond isn't beating|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Davor Suker & Zvonimir Boban:):)|pg||
nt|poohbear: OK....................|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6 kör demediði için artýk ne dese mutlu oluruz :)|pg||
nt|tokay1975: splinterle  basladi  bidding  goremez  hemen 3love hde almiyolarsa|pg||
nt|tokay1975: normal|pg||
nt|ozgull: no double no trouble|pg||
nt|gracelin: The Polish Club in operation|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes ty Adrian|pg||
nt|gracelin: 5 is probably exclusion RKC|pg||
nt|tomi2: 5@D asks for keycards outside the @D suit, but unfortunatly east has a hand where he could even pass this|pg||
nt|tomi2: I am asked why undos are accepted in this match, I can explain you:|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: when you see an undo it means in 99% of the cases, that the operator made a misclick|pg||
nt|tomi2: and not one of the players|pg||
nt|kastan88: 1@H= 7...11 , 3+@H|pg||
mb|4D|nt|othered1: cue-bid at south's second turn, unless a transfer to @D, wouldn't be everyone's choice.|pg||
nt|andy_h: South was obviously hoping for @HKQ-6th with North...but didn't 3@C say weak with hearts, Bas?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: one poor guy is sitting close to the table and tries to record the cardplay for all of us here in BBO|pg||
nt|tomi2: most often players play either very slow or very fast, so in the "fast" case it is hard to follow all cards and bids|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mr Sikora is now counting on his fingers :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: Nawrocki was surely imagining counting on his fingers|pg||
nt|gracelin: 5NT shows two but I onkt see 1 key card outside D in East's hand.|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: must've gone wrong somewhere. restarted the count|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes something is wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: probably the false 5nt is giving him headache|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would expect 2 keycards and no @HQ from east using my fingers to count|pg||
nt|Walddk4: A bit annoying to watch a board that has been played already|pg||
mb|4H|nt|poohbear: yes girl Make them pay|pg||
nt|MolvaM: we can do turkish commentary in one room in ALL of the matches of turkey. no problem. just let me know|pg||

nt|mariner1: well he can certainly ruff @H if E cashes the K@C|pg||
nt|athene: are we still here?|pg||
nt|mariner1: ruff HIGH|pg||
nt|kaapo: A good point yes, you aren't really going anywhere (but trouble perhaps) by bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and where you know the result|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: E hoping there is a play that is hard to see, there isn't|pg||
nt|gracelin: the 3rd step 5NT should show 2 key cards without HQ, so West knows someting is still missing for the grand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did S miss?|pg||
nt|gh1: he sleep home now|pg||
nt|rodal f: @SA - and a new @C.|pg||
nt|yuval10: why? you can make some bet with your friends about it|pg||
nt|yuval10: like i bet the lead will be.....2@d|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think @S6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|charles_l: maybe he distusts W's bidding 3@d|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: the Ace holding mr. Simonsen is now asking for a recapitulation of the bidding|pg||
nt|tomi2: this needs some "thorowaway" squeeze|pg||
nt|gracelin: but from east's point of view, if no key-card is missing, he wants to be in seven|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You win|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yuval10: lol i had a safety though, according to running scores|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tomi2: west was probably asking for 3rd round kontrol in clubs and E thought he made no mistake and had this control and running tricks|pg||
nt|gracelin: good lead, save everybody time and energy|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: now mr Simonsen is asking for a recapitulation with his partner :)|pg||

nt|MolvaM: türkiyenin maçýnýn verilip verilmeyeceði yarýn sabah belli olacak|pg||

nt|rodal f: If @H was played defence needed to play @S before a new @C for 1 down. Not easy|pg||

nt|kaapo: EW seem to like bidding 1NT a lot|pg||

pc|d5|nt|athene: declarer needs two diamond ruffs so he can pitch a heart on the @CJ and avoid the heart finesse|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kaapo: Arvidsson's opening 1NT on the previous board cost a few IMPs versus the 1@S contract that was played in the other room|pg||

mb|p|nt|tokay1975: splinter yapildiktan sonra  bunu kontrlamak bence mucize |pg||
nt|tokay1975: cok zor|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North led a trump next door, hence the overtrick|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: 4 boards  to go -most of the swings -2 slams -normal   in a match between 2 good teams |pg||
nt|athene: perhaps 3@H is just too high in fact|pg||
nt|athene: redouble to play from south? :)|pg||
nt|athene: a modern idea is to use the redouble to show a different hand|pg||
nt|athene: you can either play that pass = 2 hearts only|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H = 3 hearts min|pg||
nt|athene: and xx = 3 hearts max|pg||
nt|athene: or you can play that 2@H = 3 hearts, positional|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 800 seyirciye ulaþtýk|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: and xx = 3 hearts, prefers pd to play it|pg||
nt|athene: typically with something like @Dxxx|pg||
nt|athene: in case pd has a diamond tenace|pg||
nt|mariner1: REDBL must show a real NT and a fit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Seems strange that Emma did not raise|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: or a willingness to play @D I suppose|pg||
nt|athene: if north has a problem, the XX must be to play|pg||
nt|tomi2: 7@D on finding @DQ and this error and the match is close again|pg||
nt|kaapo: North has long support but no strength, shape, nor @C honours|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: could be a huge win for poland instead|pg||
nt|andy_h: A chance for Netherlands to pick up here - but it's hard to see where the 7th trick is going to come from|pg||
nt|liviu123: only if play @D on time :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|raghavan: If they do not cash Clubs - will make 12. May not lead from CA xxx|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S worked well in Open Room|pg||
nt|athene: if it showed 3 hearts, north wld bid 2@H like a shot|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: where is this going?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: or 4 @S much better|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: EW has a lucky 6D/6NT here.  But shouldn't be bid.|pg||
nt|kaapo: East is very maximum for his limited opening|pg||
nt|po-s: 4sp by Simon?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: the Swedes have nothing printed on the ceiling... the thinking is done by staring at the screen :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: 3 nt from W might have been better ?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|charles_l: i wonder if 2@c is GF @c or bal|pg||
nt|charles_l: it is a common treatment|pg||
nt|davidb: D  guess for the contract |pg||
nt|athene: i prefer to bid over 1NT with that west hand|pg||
nt|kaapo: I hope it's the sreen that divides that table and not your screen ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: lol, yes :)|pg||
nt|othered1: This is a not very lucky spot.  4@S on the west hand, however, is very pushy.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you can't go letting people play in 2@H when you have spades!|pg||
nt|mariner1: so Greece likely to pickup a dual part score swing here|pg||
nt|poohbear: severe comunication problems oin this hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: East isnt going anywhere|pg||
nt|eerbil: evet 4 daha|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 5@c after a short consultation of the system on the ceiling|pg||
mb|p|nt|syl: "You dont comment this bid???"-asks a kib|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I dont have time to comment|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nuclear war|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This may well roll in|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: If north leads a @h declarer will happily cash alot of tricks|pg||
nt|poohbear: on a @s lead declarer gets endplayed in hand|pg||
nt|othered1: no return looks attractive to north.  East likely hasn't guaranteed 5@S, so trump shift could be costly, too.|pg||
nt|othered1: as cards lie, @C is very effective|pg||
nt|othered1: And huge hitch may help east work out where things are.  Just won't be very helpful this time.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: LOl |pg||
nt|sybarra2: Bas are they playing with screens? |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Yes|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Both above and underneath the table surface|pg||
nt|yuval10: only @d lead, or @c and @d shift, beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not so easy for the defence to cash their tricks in the right order|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and we also know that it makes!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Because Sweden have 6 more IMPs on the official scoreboard|pg||
nt|Walddk4: after board 18|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is nothing more than a recorded broadcast. Very annoying|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: he might have bid 2@S over 2@H if east hadn't doubled|pg||
nt|athene: although of course he wouldn't have been in balancing seat|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s some relay?|pg||
nt|ritong: probably some puppet auction|pg||
nt|hedyg: Rusinow style lead, KQ@H, no J or 10|pg||
nt|ritong: mm...Q = please do not unblock, rather  means suit is not that solid|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|ritong: K would impose an unblock if available|pg||

mb|p|nt|kaapo: Whee|pg||
nt|andy_h: 3@C preemptive would not be my choice with a constructive hand. But nevertheless, it's attractive because of w/r vulnerability and that partner's a passed hand|pg||

nt|tomi2: west bid 1@S in case partner has support, he still had @Daxxx in bag in case he finds out partner has only dias and no spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: seems he still believes its takeout because he did not lead @D|pg||

nt|tomi2: yes so if he makes an overtrick and other 2 boards are flat, then they score 15-15|pg||
nt|tomi2: if he makes 10 and other boards are flat, then it's 16-14 for poland|pg||
nt|gracelin: he is in trouble and need to drop CQ now to make|pg||

nt|hedyg: thanks all specs for joining, we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: first time Vugraph operator|pg||
nt|hedyg: you are doing fine Adrian , it's a tuff job!|pg||
nt|ritong: extremely tough, right|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: alright, this is the last board of the segment|pg||
nt|kaapo: 5@CX brought 12 IMPs to Sweden, while other table failed to make 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thx Kari & Po|pg||
nt|kaapo: Indeed it is. Thanks a lot Florin. Excellent job and excellent boards too :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: last bd.  |pg||

nt|sybarra2: thx to Bas, our brilliant operator |pg||
nt|sybarra2: and thx to Ed Shapiro for joining me |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: My pleasure Shirley :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and the last 4 today|pg||
nt|andy_h: yes, definitely ideal for BAM :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: if P didn't lead your suit, you'd assumer he has a reason for it|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: 19 tricks in M' s|pg||
nt|athene: might end up in 2NT here|pg||
nt|mug: if EW reach 3NT on these cards they will make it easily|pg||
mb|3D|nt|charles_l: ty to Florin|pg||
nt|mug: but the values are not really there|pg||
nt|MolvaM: evet son ele geldik.  bu maçta bizlere yorumlarý ile iþik tutan nafiz zorlu, levent özgül, erdinç erbil ve mustafa cem tokay'a teþekkürler|pg||

nt|tokay1975: tesekkurler   |pg||
nt|yuval10: and to our last board of the session we go|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: many thanks to all the sponsors and organizers for helping BBO bring us the|pg||
nt|mariner1: vugraphs!|pg||
nt|gracelin: Norway can sacrifice in 5D here to tie the match, or to push opponents to 5S for a win.|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C isn't natural|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mariner1: and thanks for their wit and insight to my co-commentators William Frisby and Mike|pg||
nt|mariner1: Gold (Great Britain), and Roland Wald (Denmark).....I am Rob Brown (USA)........|pg||
nt|hedyg: i like the upgrade to 1NT|pg||
nt|tomi2: they play 4 card suits, yes?|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: and to Anita & Raghavan|pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at it!|pg||
nt|mariner1: special thanks to all the spectators, those comments and tips really do help us a lot!|pg||
nt|athene: a heart lead is nice, whoever declares|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N in N made 4 here in Open Room|pg||
nt|kaapo: What it is in fact hasn't been clarified|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: oops 1N in EAST made 4|pg||
nt|MolvaM: seyircilerimize de önerileri ve yorumlarý ve bize katýldýklarý için teþekkürler|pg||
nt|tomi2: so south knows of 8 dias total "only"?|pg||
nt|pelu: we are just clsing down on thee bridgefestival in Vingsted in denmark 1 weak with championships - open team and a lot of open tournaments|pg||
mb|d|nt|babydolldk: you too|pg||
nt|raghavan: We thank all sweet kibits, co commentators Anita and Charles, Excellant VuGraph operator, Roland and BBO |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thx commentators. i hope i'll see yo u again in a few hours|pg||
nt|MolvaM: milli takýmlarýmýza da baþarýlar|pg||
nt|kaapo: 6@D would need @Ds 2-2|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and I am sure there are many more to thank for bringing this to bbo vugraph |pg||
nt|Walddk4: No game makes on best defence|pg||
nt|yuval10: S elects to bid 4@h, which might very well be conventional|pg||
nt|yuval10: with perfect def. 4@h is going down 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: thx all . see you later |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thanks, bye|pg||
nt|poohbear: this should buy it|pg||
nt|eerbil: tebrikler gençlerimize|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Take away the 2000 (17 IMPs) and this woul've been a much closer match|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: East downgrades somewhat - he has 11 HCP but it doesn't look good|pg||
nt|athene: he expects to need 9 fast tricks on a heart lead to make 3nt|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes its not a quality 11 at all|pg||
nt|MolvaM: önümüzdeki günlerde yapýlacak türkiye maçlarýnda gene birlikte olmak dileði ile|pg||
nt|ozgull: umarým bu maç milliler için çýkýþa geçme maçýdýr. Fena oynamadýlar baþarýlar diliyoruz|pg||
nt|kaapo: This time it is not so|pg||
nt|kaapo: The bidding might look Polish Club now|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@C could be a puppet to 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: Open Room result by the way was 1NT +3|pg||
nt|athene: and he has no aces and no long suit...|pg||
nt|tomi2: so Poland will win this 16-14.  Thx to both teams for this interesting set|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, tough to find the sacrifice after 4S.  Yes, I agree with specs' comments that both pairs performed very well at their age.  They might be the future of our game.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: double denied 4 spades, i assume, so 2@S is just offering to play the Moysian|pg||
nt|le joker: thanks all ! see you in 3rd match :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ty all see U in an hour|pg||
nt|ritong: so, 44 imps gap|pg||
nt|tokay1975: tebrikler genclere|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps intending to show an invitational hand later|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Ty for help|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ozgull: 22 - 8 ile günü kapatmak  iyi moral tebrikler gençler|pg||
nt|yuval10: X should indicate @d lead |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ritong: erm|pg||
nt|po-s: then 3D would  show his full hand (North´s)|pg||
nt|kaapo: If 2@C was a puppet to 2@D (including the option of passing 2@D), North's not bidding 2@D would show extra strength|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mug: imaginative 2@S bid from Bell, he has denied four of them, so 2@S shows three, maximum for his bidding, partner can work it out|pg||
nt|ritong: make that 36|pg||
nt|tomi2: next segment will be in 50 Minutes I rhink|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: taking the heart ruff in the short hand if partner has 4-3-3-3 or something like that|pg||
nt|po-s: I suggested 3D - would show extra AND his shape|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tomorrow 0900 Girls. Junior 21 start 1630. All CET|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mariner1: for fun I put E had into the K&R evaluator K&R (KT6 K3 KQ84 7652) = 10.65|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks, Shirley, Bas and specs.|pg||
nt|yuval10: at least according to Emma, i guess|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mariner1: so E has an 11 worth less than face value|pg||
nt|fahir: tüm yorumculara teþekkürler, Brasov dan iyi akþamlar|pg||
nt|po-s: and would get a potential 3NT played by South|pg||
nt|kaapo: There might be trouble in 3@D if North hasn't shown real clubs yet|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps 1@S could be 18+ (or so) with 5+@S|pg||
nt|po-s: well, yes, who knows - do they have a convention card?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi   K&R|pg||
nt|tomi2: we will have Sweden - Latvia and Netherlands - France|pg||

nt|po-s: they might end up in 6|pg||
nt|po-s: by now he has probably shown his clubs|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mariner1: the good news here in N does not have a high @c pip|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kaapo: And there they are|pg||
nt|po-s: and North or South probably forgot what 2C was|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: massive consultations on both sides of the screen|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: in the OR N is in 3NT|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, yes, maybe they have to work on their CC a little bit more themselves, too|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and made +3|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ritong: i havent the VP scale under my eyes, presumably 21 or 22 VPs to frenchies|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmmm missed the @c switch for -1!|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: the defence can organize south a heart ruff but that doesn't help them enormously|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry i was in 4@s :(|pg||
nt|ritong: are you sure?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no :(|pg||
nt|ritong: ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty all, bye for now|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous, c ya ll lmater|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: bye now|pg||
nt|tomi2: so thx all here and hope to see you again later!|pg||
nt|pelu: only 6 tricks - in Open east was - almost .) - squeezed, and droped a @H - so decl set up the 7. trick in @H|pg||
nt|kastan88: yes, good result for Latvia in Open room|pg||
pc|cK|nt|raghavan: S has to give atleast a Spade and 2Clubs|pg||

pc|c9|nt|po-s: too many ace leads against slams|pg||
nt|kaapo: Not a great finish for an exiting and close match|pg||
nt|kaapo: Luckily this is the last board of the day|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|kaapo: So NS have time to erase this mishap from their memories and start with a fresh day tomorrow|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gracelin: Thanks specs, Thomas, and the very capable VG operator Florin.  See you soon.|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yes. 17.30 local|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: see you!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mug: @CK in fear of the heart ruff|pg||
nt|mariner1: well that play worked for S|pg||
nt|athene: pressure play from south!|pg||
nt|mug: but it may have cost him the contract|pg||
nt|athene: west doesn't want to lose to @CQ and then @C9 on the overruff and @CA@DA to come|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mug: don't think South would have played a trump from @CAxx|pg||
nt|yuval10: going down 1 now, it looks like|pg||
mc|9|nt|yuval10: according to running scores - 77:44 is the final result|pg||
