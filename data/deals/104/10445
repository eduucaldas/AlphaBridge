nt|athene: perhaps 3@H is just too high in fact|pg||
nt|athene: redouble to play from south? :)|pg||

nt|athene: he expects to need 9 fast tricks on a heart lead to make 3nt|pg||

mb|2H|nt|mug: Open Room result by the way was 1NT +3|pg||
nt|athene: and he has no aces and no long suit...|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: double denied 4 spades, i assume, so 2@S is just offering to play the Moysian|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|mug: imaginative 2@S bid from Bell, he has denied four of them, so 2@S shows three, maximum for his bidding, partner can work it out|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: taking the heart ruff in the short hand if partner has 4-3-3-3 or something like that|pg||

nt|athene: pressure play from south!|pg||
nt|mug: but it may have cost him the contract|pg||
nt|athene: west doesn't want to lose to @CQ and then @C9 on the overruff and @CA@DA to come|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mug: don't think South would have played a trump from @CAxx|pg||

pc|s7|nt|charles_l: still 4 to play in the open room|pg||
pc|s4|nt|raghavan: Open room seems  to be slow |pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||
nt|raghavan: curtains|pg||
nt|charles_l: thanks all and bye|pg||
nt|babydolldk: bye|pg||
nt|raghavan: TX and Byeeee to alll |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: app. W had doubled|pg||
nt|mug: but it was a good shot by South|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|mariner1: now he can lose 9@C in ruff too|pg||
nt|athene: if south really did have @CA9x and want a heart over-ruff, it would be more natural for him to try spades and diamonds to find partner's ace|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps lead a diamond simply to try to set up a diamond ruff for partner|pg||
nt|athene: so perhaps that small trump was suspicious - but not at all easy for declarer to be fair|pg||
