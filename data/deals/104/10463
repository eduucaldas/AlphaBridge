nt|mdgraham: well done West to play the @D8|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|mmmakela: there used to be a rule that the strongest opening can't have a weak option right?|pg||
nt|ady: declarer liekly to get diamond position wrong on the lead|pg||

nt|raghavan: Why Mike I used to get enthusiasm from you all these days|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|raghavan: Should play D A or K|pg||
nt|raghavan: East is trying to enter W to get club |pg||
nt|raghavan: So sure it is E has C A and Q|pg||
nt|ady: North is short  of tricks    may feel the need to finesse 10@D|pg||
nt|ady: if he takes this finesse can make with an end play on east|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ha and CAQ are with E so take 3 Spades and 2 Diamonds - let us see what E will throw- anyhow may end 1 down |pg||
nt|ady: only problem is dedclarer may be squeezed before east if he cashed the diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: cashes|pg||

nt|suketbombi: the score indeed is 1100 on last bd corrected now|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 5@c for EW. Will they find it?|pg||

mb|2C|nt|andyv:  N is wondering if everyone has 10hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: For me it looks like a @d lead is the onlyway to make|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: declarer should have played a low diamond at trick 2 and ruffed  and taken discard   if west had dducked the 2nd diamond would have gone down     a kib spooted this|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: if N is 13-15, W will bid 2Nt |pg||
nt|raghavan: If NT = 13-15|pg||
nt|ralfwil: WD EW!|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|xenya: i'm not sure about that 3N...|pg||
mb|4C!|an|Splinter|nt|don paulus: kind of gambling|pg||
nt|xenya: what do you think?|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2C+2D+ SA and a ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: Niels is known to be a "bidder" :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good evaluation by West with his three small hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: common for 1M-2NT to show limit raise + |pg||
nt|raghavan: well bid without much fuss|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that is, a raise to 3M or better|pg||
nt|ady: seems 2NT here is a limit raise or better |pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|xenya: both N and E are it seems|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I kind of like it so pass?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Mike from Uk here hi Vladimir hi Makela|pg||
nt|xenya: i confess i would pass with the N hand|pg||

nt|raghavan: WC Mike|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry?|pg||
nt|lestergold: re hi Raghaven|pg||
mb|5S|nt|suketbombi: six@S a good contract wud be push here|pg||
nt|lestergold: this could go well if declarer runsthe 9 of dims now|pg||
nt|ady: will need to establish a diamond trick for the 8th|pg||
nt|raghavan: correctly stopped in 2NT = 3S+3H+2C |pg||
nt|raghavan: Hi Mike - gald to work with you again'|pg||
nt|ady: will eventually lose 1 daimond trick in addition|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: or find @hAx|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: e Ave, lead that . since declarere may have singleton K in that suit|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|lestergold: presumably the dim play is completely marked by the bidding and lack of lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@h would have been a decent save|pg||
pc|d9|nt|april7: W will discard 2 @S on KQ of @D and ruff a @H in dumy|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|xenya: E just might have passed over N's pass, but i think he would have raised all the same|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: has blocked the hearts even if he reaqds position which is with the odds|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mmmakela: don't think so|pg||

nt|jumpshift: looks like a straightforward slam here for e-w....|pg||
nt|jumpshift: but after watching last qtr, the slams are not so easy to bid|pg||
nt|bbramley: 6NT is ironclad, but i expect them to reach 6@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jumpshift: only thing that can go wrong is a blackwood screwup|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|bbramley: 2@H now is clear|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jumpshift: Standard expert practice is to rebid 2@H even if 6-4.... to make it easier to find heart fit at low level|pg||
nt|jumpshift: which happen in real life matches|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|jumpshift: If west were to rebid 2@S and east rebid 3@H that would be a STOPPER not necessarily 4-cards|pg||
nt|bbramley: wow, BBO allows that?|pg||
nt|flash: connection probs??   two bids of 2@S unlikely??|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: 3@D failed by 3 tricks E-W in other room, so 7 IMPs to Lynch|pg||
nt|jumpshift: I discovered that earlier in the week while I was being a vugraph operator.....   new feature to allow for insufficient bids|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|flash: flexibility adds a new range of possible problems...    the law of unintended consequences?|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu2: Lair put the screen down to ask for a review (I think)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Now has put his cards on the table and leaning on the table thinking|pg||
nt|bbramley: some problems aren't worth fixing :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: trumps agreed; rkcb; 2 w/ the queen; conclusion|pg||
nt|bbramley: lead it or lose it|pg||
nt|jimkrek: ur so cold bart:)|pg||
mb|p|pc|c3|nt|robinswr: i make attacking leads against slams so i would lead the ace|pg||
nt|jumpshift: how about underlead it?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|flash: if i'm gonna give up the overtrick, at least let me do it trying to beat an unbeatable contract  :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|pab1: Drewski still has hopes of making this, though we can see he can|pg||
nt|pab1: can't escape two Trump losers|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bbramley: only safe play for the overtrick is 2 rounds of spades ending in dummy - need 2-2|pg||
nt|bbramley: or stiff 10|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||
nt|pab1: With 2 Aces shown in the North, he'll figure the Spade King is offside.  He can hope to prevent the Jack from scoring|pg||
nt|flash: slam in other room and Ekeblad underleads the @DA!!|pg||
nt|flash: nothing wimpy over there!!|pg||
nt|robinswr: that is bridge|pg||
mc|12|nt|bbramley: well, this is a different play - he needs 3-3 clubs for the overtrick - must choose between 2-2 @S or 3-3 @Cs|pg||
nt|jumpshift: wow, did he really only claim 12?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: gave up a diamond|pg||

nt|ady: part score hand    lijkely 1NT e/w|pg||
nt|ralfwil: happy to find @sA on side|pg||
nt|april7: but the way the defnce was he didn't need it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score hand |pg||
nt|xenya: missed that somehow|pg||
mb|1D!|an|can be short or canape|nt|lestergold: e/w cold for heart game!|pg||
nt|lestergold: but hard to reqach|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after @hQ he must have bad thoughts about @sA|pg||
nt|april7: 1NT by N and E will X and then we will see|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: diamond contract for e/w looks best|pg||
nt|xenya: we know what 2@C means!|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: @Ds or a strong hand, i've been told|pg||
nt|april7: XX = @C?|pg||
nt|andyv:  south will bail out in @cs|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mmmakela: Mike is it allowed to have a weak option in 2 @C strong in UK?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: awkward for North over 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: unless he has a natural 2@D available....|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mdgraham: not that 2@D is likely to be much of a success|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: lead down to 41 imps here but then there is a 1100 on bd 32|pg||
nt|raghavan: May lead C|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think so|pg||
nt|mdgraham: redouble can be used as a puppet to 2@C, in order to play in 2 of a minor |pg||
nt|april7: if its not forcing , W should pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which allows 2@C to be stayman, as other bids as system on |pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: no-trump opening kept e/w out of bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: wello best defence will see this about 2 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: but e/w can make a dim contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: not normally|pg||
nt|mmmakela: neither in Finland|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: 47|pg||
nt|raghavan: Invitation which W will refuse |pg||
nt|ady: n/s  better in spades    but south has no good reason to bid|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: yet as cards lie 5 frigid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt on W, but they will find their 4-4 in @h?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but a quiet finish to the auction|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's surprising|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this can go down 3 on best defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: cash in right order maybe 3 off with a trump promoted|pg||
nt|xenya: who is to blame here, if anyone?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: must admit I wd've bid 4 as E|pg||
nt|lestergold: no one|pg||
nt|april7: but only 2 @D are in|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Ca and High C|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: sorry even now it is 59 too many diartractions here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: with 1oo on bd 32 the match seems to be over |pg||
nt|suketbombi: 1100|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|april7: and not even that, no entry to dummy|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|don paulus: benefit of preempts|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: after heart ruff dims cashed then ace and another club will do it|pg||
nt|raghavan: N may try to get 2 or 3 ruffs with small Diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: yes    might restrick to down 2    which will be no loss as e/w likely to maked 8 or 9 tricks in no-trumps|pg||
pc|c8|nt|raghavan: what a defense!!|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|cT|pg||
nt|raghavan: 4th H declarer should ruff with Dj, ruff club etc |pg||
pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: looks like -1|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|raghavan: Trump promotion S10?|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: shoudl hav cashed dims first but i still think its 3 off|pg||
nt|ady: east best to play Q@D|pg||
nt|raghavan: West should have played D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence has gone slightly astray, not playing a trump|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes I think West had the chance- probably holding to his 10 to 4 trumps|pg||
nt|ady: if east plays another club  and north plays 4th hearft   east can discard a spade    so still down 2|pg||
nt|raghavan: East may lead  club K? we do not know |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Knut Blakset|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: the game is a perfecto |pg||
nt|don paulus: this system was quite popular in B - Holland - 2 @c as weak @d or SF|pg||

nt|wolwerine: Hi evrybody|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pelu: why dont u allowe a weak option in 2@C? - lets say why not a strong opyion : 2@c = weak @D or strong|pg||
nt|don paulus: nowadays more often 2@c weak with both majors - or SF|pg||
nt|raghavan: enter in H and throw S on CQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: few would reach it east's hnad is full o bholes how does he know that west'shand fits so perc|pg||
nt|xenya: low preempts, mind you -- if N hada been more active, he may have pushed EW to 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: fectly the q club is enormous|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: I now have cc for NS -- same as Graversen played in SanRemo -- 2@c is eighter strong or weak @d|pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: Sorry everyone, we have had some technical difficulties, think we are OK now.  Contract seems to be 3N by E|pg||
nt|robinswr: he has 5diamonds, 2spades and 3 clubs easy make thats if they lead a club |pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|jumpshift: only an imp....no one every lost a match by one...|pg||
nt|bbramley: but a 2nd @S was the better try, because could still make them all when south had the 3 trumps and 3 clubs|pg||
nt|robinswr: i hope they don't lose by one or 2 because this is the second loss of a locked trick|pg||
mb|1D|nt|stew: yes ... that's what I meant ... to save the extra trick|pg||
nt|flash: thnx, Bob - we know they're playing 4-handed, but it seems at least a bit strange not to make some play for it|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jimkrek: hi-what a treat to watch my 2 main partners fight it out  (with each other)|pg||
nt|flash: all references to 1-IMP losses heartily unwelcome (even though made by those connected to team)|pg||

mb|2C|nt|USBF: hi Fred, thank you and Peter for your comments :)|pg||
nt|pab1: hi all|pg||
nt|stew: they should have an easy road to 4H and no higher|pg||
nt|pab1: 2NT some type of good Heart raise.  |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|pab1: West is minimum in high cards, but should accept because of his extra shape and Aces|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jimkrek: they play that as a good heart raise with shortness-John cd have relayed to ask|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Drew asks whether if Onstott asked for splinter it would be coded, and Onstott says yes|pg||
nt|pab1: Note Berk's Vul vs Non-Vul 3D bid.  Usually pretty safe when the opps have a fit and are on their way to game.  Might help partner with the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|jimkrek: though they might not have worked it out over 3ds:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Onstott: "Is that the K of spades? I thought it was the King" Drew: "I might have opened the bidding"|pg||
mb|p|nt|jumpshift: Schwartz able to bid agressively here:   because the cards are "onside" in opener's hand|pg||
nt|drewsky: looks like 3NT makes and 4@H is down one|pg||
nt|robinswr: 2clubs? what would he do over 2spades|pg||
nt|bbramley: this is going to be brutal punishment for an aggressive game bid - finesse thru opener loses|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jumpshift: If partner had opened 1N, he might well just pass rather than Stayman|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|jumpshift: over a 2@S response he would bid 2N invitational, as he intends to invite game all along|pg||
nt|flash: Berk Xd over Ekeblad's 1@D opener|pg||

nt|ady: South has some good defense with partner in the bidding|pg||

mb|p|nt|pab1: Onstott times the play correctly for the overtrick -- starting Spades while there were enough entries to the dummy|pg||

mb|p|nt|USBF: wonderful|pg||

nt|jumpshift: someone has to follow Larry's laws...|pg||
nt|flash: since 4@H is an xfer to 4@S might something more 'strategic' be in order?|pg||
nt|jimkrek: reasonable-but will force jones to bid the winning 4s|pg||

nt|drewsky: because I have played quite a bit with him over the last few years|pg||
nt|flash: in the Open Room, of course, Ekeblad opened the North hand on 49 with 1@H   :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Vugraphu8: prior hand was a bid club action|pg||
nt|flash: and Granovetter jumped to 4@H; Lair didn't accept the xfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: another 1nt - 3nt hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jumpshift: not automatic for 4@S to make on last hand.    If declarer ruffs a heart, may have 2 trump losers and 2 diamond losers|pg||
nt|bbramley: another unlucky result looming for the declaring side here - 6@D down 1 on a club ruff|pg||
mb|3D|nt|marlowepi: how does one adjust to your talents, drew? :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: if he can play with you he can play with anyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|drewsky: When MIke plays with me, his NT range is 12-18 for 1NT|pg||
nt|robinswr: will gerstman show both majors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: does he ever cheat?|pg||
nt|robinswr: i think he should|pg||

mb|4C|nt|robinswr: i play 4hearts shows minors, and 4nt is rkc|pg||
nt|flash: how does everyone treat the North hand in this auction?   worth showing as a 2-suiter (despite the disparity in length)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pab1: 2C Cappellletti, one suiter|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: The players distracted me  by discussing how many clubs they could make :)|pg||
nt|drewsky: don't worry guys, I can take it, but I can DISH IT OUT TOO|pg||
nt|robinswr: i thought that if you have shortness you're supposed to bid over 1nt especially in p/o seat|pg||
nt|jumpshift: 4@H next, then...|pg||
nt|jimkrek: i meant 4 hearts or 4nt|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Vugraphu2: Berk, putting down dummy: "I could have gone after them, sorry if it would have been right"|pg||
nt|robinswr: 4nt  is blackwood|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|marlowepi: i would treat the N hand as diamonds. you need a 3-card disparity to prefer clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|pab1: looks like 8 tricks farily easily|pg||
nt|drewsky: Jim, would you balance as south ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|drewsky: I would if I was 5-5 majors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, steve, especially at these colors because pd may have a good hand. you may not have what he wants on defense, but you may be able to make something significant|pg||
nt|robinswr: suppose 2clubs showed both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|jimkrek: 2nt probably some mechanism to find out about sontags dist...i think he sd 4 trumps and min|pg||
nt|drewsky: YUP|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: i mean, partner has to have three more clubs than diamonds, minimum, for clubs to rate to be better|pg||
nt|jimkrek: 4ht is 1 or 2 losers-4nt 3 or 4...this looks like the 1 or 2 hand|pg||
nt|bbramley: wow - wasn't north worth 4@H at least over 4@D?|pg||
nt|jumpshift: I changed my mind..   I like 4@C better.    say pard has stiff diamond and jack third of clubs|pg||
nt|flash: board 49 in as a push|pg||
pc|cT|nt|stew: even if they get their 2 spade tricks it's still 8|pg||

nt|drewsky: 4-5-4-0 sorry|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|jimkrek: and drewsky wd raise me:)|pg||
nt|bbramley: maybe sutherlin has noticed the trend - aggressive bidding is being punished so far this set|pg||
nt|flash: on this one, Berk spurned the 2@H opener with the 4-card @S side suit; Lair overcalled 1@H with 1@S|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with the N hand i would not welcome a force at trick one playing in clubs|pg||
nt|drewsky: I like Sutherlin's initial approach of 3@D, but over 4@D I would que 4@H|pg||
nt|flash: P-1@H*-1@S-X   4@S-P-P-?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: yes, when N holds a 2-;oser hand, something a trifle more ambitious than 5D is in order|pg||
pc|cK|nt|stew: Wow   the other room .. the play did not go well for minus 300|pg||
nt|jimkrek: i agree you sd stretch to balance with shortness-but that is a little too stretchy so to speak|pg||
pc|d8|nt|robinswr: did schwatz really set up passell's six-card suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: yes|pg||
nt|drewsky: At the other table, north doubled 1NT and south bid 2@C and is playing it there|pg||
nt|flash: Meckwell in action at other table - Ekeblad as North Xd to show 1 minor or both majors...   inelegant result|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|fallenius: 3C worked out great although probably not completely in range with what it should show in most partnerships|pg||
nt|bbramley: 3@D would probably go down 1, but if they pushed N/S to 3@S they could set that|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Still more questions about the team name SweDanes, E-W in this room are Danes, their team-mates in the other room are Swedes. The name "borrowed" from way back|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Swe-Danes, 1958-1961, Swedish-Danish jazz and entertainment trio consisting of Alice Babs (singer), Svend Asmussen (violin), and Ulrik Neumann (guitar)|pg||
nt|wolwerine: Problems with screens - you can't see the lead was made with the left hand:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|suketbombi: well|pg||

pc|s4|nt|andyv:  3@d proved to be very effective|pg||

pc|s3|nt|xenya: a nice 8-imp pick-up for Ballebo |pg||
nt|vugraphztn: I have lost interest ... says W as he layed down the cards|pg||
nt|raghavan: Both teams are running neck to neck |pg||

pc|cA|nt|ady: 11 tricks    picking up the diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: 11 tricks likely just the two bullets for the defence|pg||
pc|c3|nt|wolwerine: USP= Useful Space Principle = transfers|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the problem was that East was a bit light for a re-opening double of 3D|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C  pushy|pg||
nt|raghavan: He will lose 2D +1H +1S |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|raghavan: He must make 11 tricks - 2S+2H+4D+3C=11|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  a likely make for e/w|pg||

pc|c6|nt|ady: singleton ace with east Mike|pg||
pc|c5|nt|raghavan: take 3C+2H |pg||
nt|lestergold: but playing qd first would still guarantee 9 tricks i suppose its whether you think the odds of a stuiff dim ace are high|pg||
nt|raghavan: E can throw a H hoping W keeps H9|pg||

nt|stew: agree good methods|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: I didn't have time at trick 1, but Berk commented that he didn't have exactly what he should have - should have had a 4th club - now they're discussing which slam is best - decided ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: 6@c best, since it makes if either minor breaks and maybe even if both don't|pg||
nt|flash: N-S overboard in the other room on that one, so another swing coming to Lynch|pg||
nt|bbramley: more voids!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, it seems a bit odd not to try to set your own suit up when you are the one with the entries, and instead lead QTx on pure spec. also pd is fairly likely to be on lead|pg||
mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: i welcome a spade lead from partner, but if on lead myself a heart seems like normal|pg||
mb|3H|nt|stew: chance for another lynch pickup here|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: if the opps get to 3N, there may be no great inference to be drawn from fact that pd passed throughout|pg||
mb|p|nt|jumpshift: double for takeout anyone?|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|robinswr: if he guesses diamonds he should make 3nt|pg||
nt|bbramley: good thing larry's not here - another law violation here - 20 trumps, 19 tricks|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: it is a fact oflife that the promulgators of any law arrogate the right to break it|pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: Where's Larry when Berk is making good bids? :)|pg||
nt|jimkrek: in case partner was 6-2|pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: Lair said he thought 4@d was choice of games; Drew asks "can we confirm that?" Berk said he also thought it was a choice of games|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jimkrek: drew and i call it 'armenian' proof|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a cas en point|pg||
nt|jimkrek: even we cant go down|pg||
nt|robinswr: wouldn't it be better for passell to bid 3hearts to disguise the spade holding|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he probablt prefers S to be declarer|pg||
nt|jimkrek: not if N was looking for a 4-4M fit|pg||
nt|bbramley: not enough bidding by E/W however - 4@S by west hard to beat|pg||
pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: 6H could be cold from S but not from N|pg||

nt|flash: ??    if the @HQ is on-side, it'd still be on-side later|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|robinswr: what entry are you going to use to take it later|pg||

nt|wolwerine: 7@H looks wrong. Why not 6@D? That must ask for @CQ|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Maybe RÃ¸n could have investigated after 6@C. Plenty of room. I agree with Knut|pg||
pc|h6|nt|xenya: they will beat it i think, but probably not enough to make up for a vulnerable game|pg||

nt|lestergold: defence started well and then went downhill with a veangance|pg||
nt|mmmakela: well the pass got more than it deserved imo|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: Hansen left for toilet|pg||
nt|raghavan: Knut but well stopped very precise bidding|pg||
nt|raghavan: friends > after 6 deals compared scores are 5 and 4 = only 1 difference- This speaks volume about both teams being equal|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: Hansen back|pg||
nt|pelu: good bridge - or very flat boards :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: beautiful misfit here|pg||
nt|lestergold: who is going to get into trouble?|pg||
nt|xenya: unless EW get to 6 in OR|pg||
nt|mdgraham: disappointing for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  they have to let that board go|pg||
nt|april7: 3NT goes down without a @S lead, but what should S lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not a good fit    |pg||
mb|1N|an|14+-17|nt|raghavan: N has the master suit - |pg||
nt|lestergold: south praying fro a reopening doubl|pg||
nt|ady: penalty pass from south|pg||
nt|raghavan: Double dummy looks for slam in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: 5 D contract |pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: wow h e got it!|pg||
nt|wolwerine: After Norths 2@S no problem finding @SQ|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: 2C is GF|pg||
nt|raghavan: Let us see and enjoy how they reach slam and make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: now in trouble|pg||
nt|mmmakela: -1|pg||
nt|mmmakela: could be|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N looks better here|pg||
nt|raghavan: If Clubs not lead - will make|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 nt foolproof|pg||
mb|2D|nt|raghavan: S may bid 3H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may end in 6@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: and the bidding will call for a @C-lead|pg||
nt|mmmakela: without dias tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: i think @C lead is indicated on this auction|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @SQ lets it through|pg||
mb|3N|nt|raghavan: Knut - your brother is really aggressive - worth it|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Interesting from EW point of view|pg||
nt|lestergold: a couple of round of trumps and the children will have to be asked to leave the room|pg||
nt|ady: was only a part score hand   may be expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: "I would rather have been partner with you" said W after laying down the cards .. and then West left the table|pg||
nt|lestergold: alonmg with the women and children....|pg||
nt|andyv:  takes care of worrying about what to lead against 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: H7 also may get a trick |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: indeed :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphztn: maybe a refreshing cigarette|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wolwerine: I know, he is also very aggressive when he plays with me, but it is not in the bidding...|pg||
nt|april7: why not X of 4@S?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this could be another no-play slam....|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: oh my|pg||
nt|raghavan: OH OH OH|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that 2@S bid may tell West how to play the spades|pg||
nt|wolwerine: Problem with entrys|pg||
nt|pelu: can u make 6@C?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Knut why they have not landed in 6S - knowing E has 5 cards in Spade and W has 3??|pg||
nt|wolwerine: The club suit is solid - Lars didn't know about @S109|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@S easy - no entry for the @ss|pg||
nt|pelu: in 61C|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@C|pg||
nt|raghavan: tx Knut|pg||
nt|ady: re all    had computer problem|pg||
nt|wolwerine: Should go after a diamond ruff with @CA|pg||
nt|raghavan: Entry HA is knocked off now - |pg||
nt|andyv:  might scare them into NT?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|raghavan: Club now|pg||
nt|lestergold: the way these guys have been bidding vulnerable someone sooner or later was due for a blood bath|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another @s fron S|pg||
nt|xenya: well this can never make|pg||
nt|xenya: especially on this lead|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@D is a fine bid .) - 5@D down on a 1C-lead and 61D makes on a non 1C-lead :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Forget the word "Make"|pg||
nt|april7: its not  enough over a weak NT|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mmmakela: the good thing is that 5 doesn't make|pg||
nt|wolwerine: But still only 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I donÂ´t understand W:s action|pg||
nt|wolwerine: West has shown a good hand with both minors - pushing a little to win some imps back|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like residue bidding from last hand|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  @c lead looks safe|pg||
nt|andyv:  and there it is|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -2 or -3 I think|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|xenya: ah yes Peter, sorry|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|ralfwil: but if you switch NS cards ....|pg||
nt|andyv:  this could go for a number|pg||
nt|andyv:  E needs two finesses... if he were N, they would both work:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  20|pg||
nt|wolwerine: With ckubs and diamonds 3-2 he would only need the diamond finesse, but still not a good slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  Ron is enjoying the beauty of the dummy|pg||
nt|andyv:  when he plays the 2nd club, he will need 2 finesses:)|pg||

pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgefestival.dk/UK.aspx?ID=1305  for the tournament website (in English)|pg||

pc|h7|nt|raghavan: play D from N |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu8: roger thinking|pg||
nt|jimkrek: roger always thinking-a cute one here|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: sure 2 clubs was Presion 2 clubs|pg||
nt|jimkrek: sort of bid 3nt and see what happens|pg||
nt|fallenius: thats where it will end up, but probalby with a little probing|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: still thinking|pg||
nt|jimkrek: these are the great hands...they can usually be beaten...but you have to tread very carefully and maybe quickly|pg||
nt|jimkrek: to coin a phrase-they are meckwellian:)|pg||
nt|fallenius: :-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|stew: Lynch has had 3 nice pickups in a row |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|fallenius: heart lead - heart duck and 3d heart gives south big problem|pg||
nt|fallenius: in three NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: yes, roger passed 3clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|fallenius: wd|pg||
nt|jimkrek: roger went low-probably a good choice when void in clubs|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pab1: drew will be tempted to try 3NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|jimkrek: i think he was hopeing J wd bid it for sure|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: richie eligible to say typ|pg||
nt|flash: same contract, lead...    no reason to find the @DQ - unless trying to one-up |pg||
nt|flash: Zia|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|pab1: In hypothetical 3NT, Club to the Ace and Club ducked would appear to beat it, but the run of the Spades might squeeze South|pg||
nt|stew: this should be beaten but ma not if Drew can ditch his 2!! diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Lair puts screen down to ask about 3@d ; "long suit game try"|pg||
nt|jimkrek: yes -need a d shift now...|pg||
nt|stew: let's see ... should he find it?|pg||
nt|pab1: not if he thinks East has 4 Diamonds|pg||
nt|pab1: MYguess is he will not shift to a Diamond, since it looks dangerous|pg||
nt|stew: sure   he can visualize 2C , 1H  and if he breaks diamonds , might loose that trick|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: He's studying and his kibitzer looks as if he's either also studying or falling asleep :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|drewsky: 3@S by the guy with 2 club stoppers and 3NT by the guy with no club stoppers..am I missing something ?|pg||
nt|jimkrek: i dont like ritchie's raise or bob's 3s...ritchie guessed to bid 3nt with xxx in clubs to save it|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fallenius: but bidding 3C was also going low|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|jimkrek: right u r mr bjorn|pg||
nt|flash: now declarer needs @DA on-side? (or @CQJ tight)?|pg||
nt|robinswr: or all honors on his right|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jimkrek: he did have aLOT of clubs:)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c5|nt|pab1: declarer sould have been 5242, then a Diamond shift woulld be bad|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Berk, as Lair followed, "yeah, didn't feel like it"|pg||
nt|pab1: could have|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|stew: Yes  Well done Drew|pg||
nt|jimkrek: maybe stopped the bleeding here...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Berk: "not too easy, Mark" Drew: "tough one ... if you found a diamond shift we'd have to write you up ... record you"|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fallenius: vul it's tough not to show some enthusiam with sontags hand :-)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: ritchie undoubtedly shrugged before bidding 3N, just based on shape and strength|pg||
nt|flash: so 9 tricks it will be for a push...|pg||
nt|flash: 6 boards to see which team has to brush up on their samba...|pg||
nt|flash: (Sao Paulo ain't Rio, but it is still in Brasil, no matter what the Cariocas think)|pg||

nt|raghavan: part score deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: u sure?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx Viladirmir|pg||
nt|andyv:  might only lose 3 imps on that one|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: many would open east hand|pg||
nt|pelu: 3 x Pass - and for some players 3 x opening hands .)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|raghavan: Deal no 5 - here went down by bad play - Open room made - 12 IMp|pg||
nt|lestergold: does anyone here feel that 2c at unfavourable vulnerability was an acceptable bid?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes onr of the theories is with 11, open if you have atleast 4 card Spade|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S!|an|promises 5 !ss|nt|ralfwil: I donÂ´t like it Mike!|pg||
mb|2H|nt|suketbombi: Yes playing for @S KQ is reasonable |pg||
nt|raghavan: will N double?|pg||
nt|raghavan: So much of strength with N and S has bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: north knows south is void spade 90% certain|pg||
nt|ady: 3 spades down 1    |pg||
nt|lestergold: 4d is normal he has ebuf defence not to worry about 4s|pg||
nt|wolwerine: 2@D = both majors|pg||
nt|wolwerine: 1@S is 0-6, any distribution|pg||
mb|3H|nt|don paulus: 2 @s weak ?|pg||
nt|pelu: partscore? :):) - with this 4 players - never :9:)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 9 from top with D fin|pg||
nt|raghavan: ah ah - 3 NT makes 5D+1S+2H+1C|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: knowing the spades were 4/1|pg||
nt|raghavan: East will come in with 3C now|pg||
nt|wolwerine: or positive with diamonds|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mdgraham: this doesn't quite fetch|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Mike - both of us wrong - no double, no 4D|pg||
nt|raghavan: W bids 3C?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: and this won't, either|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not much in it    4 diamonds  130    3 spades 100|pg||
nt|andyv:  N's luck has run out|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another -2|pg||
nt|april7: only 2 down|pg||
nt|wolwerine: Well, he wasn't doubled:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|wolwerine: Think North should have bid 3@D over 3@C|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pelu: Bilde now like to take his opening back and Pass :)|pg||
nt|ady: north regretting 4th in hand opening now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|raghavan: 1 Spade loser+1D +1Club loser - let us see|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: this time the @DK is onside, so no problem with 9 tricks|pg||
nt|wolwerine: After all he knows partner has around 10 points|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: always annoying when you open fourth in hand and the oppo buy and make a contract|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mmmakela: Morse has a commanding lead over Schwartz in US Seniors final for Sao Paulo|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: but there is always equity in opps bidding 4s and then getting a penalty|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: north should have areaonable expectation that d will mak|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d4|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|c9|pg||
nt|ady: I agree with Knut   North should have contested with 3@D    it is likely that 9 tricks in one of his suits wont be a disaster|pg||

nt|Vugraphu8: yes, ns did not get eith red  A|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Mike says he should have led a spade on last hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu2: Proving that he and you (Jim) are a good partnership, Drew said "well, we finally have something to cheer about here"|pg||
nt|jimkrek: lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Onstott: "i've been waiting for you to bid"|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Vugraphu2: Guess we need trays that aren't green, so the pass cards show up better :)|pg||
nt|jimkrek: there is a choice of 1nt or 2hrts here-i prefer 1nt|pg||
nt|robinswr: looks like ns can make 7spades |pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am currently doing a research project about leading out long suits. the premise is that you lead from the top down when you want opps to discrad from the higher ranking suit, and ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: from the bottom up when you want them to throw the lowest suit. the project is well funded, but i do need more drugs :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Now they are discussing the fact that a diamond lead would set it and Mike says next case|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jimkrek: they will do well to reach 6|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: N might well have opened|pg||
nt|flash: on board 37, Granovetter ducked the @H lead in 3NT and seems to have taken all the tricks on a repeating squeeze|pg||
nt|bbramley: looks like 4@S on a guess for the trump queen|pg||
mb|4S|nt|robinswr: lite openers would have a better time|pg||
mb|p|nt|jimkrek: not to exciting here...more if 3nt the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|jimkrek: thanks drew|pg||
mb|p|nt|jimkrek: nice bid by danny...|pg||
nt|robinswr: good guess by gerstman|pg||
nt|jimkrek: very practical|pg||
pc|hA|nt|robinswr: long suit slam try|pg||
nt|bbramley: not much to go on - defense will cash their 3 winners and exit - declarer will know that @Hs are 5-4 and not much else|pg||
pc|h4|nt|robinswr: bid slam and hope to make it|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|stew: and they'll settle in 3D|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Vugraphu2: Drew: "if I had better cards for you I would  bid spades, but I've got plenty of wastage"|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
nt|flash: Lair at crossroads and...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|stew: with no really bad breaks this should just make|pg||
nt|bbramley: a 1-card difference is not enough to play north for the length - i think he'll go down|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cK|pg||
nt|jimkrek: looks like 3 or 4-probably only 3 because they got the tap going|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has 7 LTC, no real rebid problems, some defense, and playability in 3 suits including both majors. for some of us, that adds up to an opening bid, especially nonvul|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
nt|bbramley: even if he's trying to play for a swing, which play is the "swing" play?|pg||
nt|flash: :)   Lair goes wrong|pg||
nt|bbramley: he can't afford to mess around too much in the side suits without risking a ruff or overruff|pg||
nt|jumpshift: is he certain it is only a 1-card difference in hearts?|pg||
nt|bbramley: south did not open 2@H - strong inference he has only 5 @Hs|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|drewsky: I totally agree with Danny's takeout double.....many would argue for the 1@S overcall, right krek ?|pg||

mb|p|nt|wolwerine: Yes 2@C is strong|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: quarters i mean |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: Who says that there are 2 tricks in @d for the defence?|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|andyv:  the Barry Crane rule about bidding 7 in team games would have been a useful tool for E/W:)|pg||
nt|wolwerine: What did he say? Never bid seven|pg||
nt|andyv:  yeap|pg||
pc|sT|nt|suketbombi: 3nt by NS but unlikely to be there 4@H dn 1  seems to normal|pg||
nt|mmmakela: sure maybe "commanding" was an overbid|pg||

nt|wolwerine: Looks like 500|pg||
nt|andyv:  not just say it, he was adament about it.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: 3N should make as south has no entry to his diamonds and spades lie well for declarer|pg||

nt|lestergold: off of course if he doesnt duck bbut h ewill|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|raghavan: It is going to be bad for EW - 3Spades+2H+2D+1C= may be 3 down for 500|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|wolwerine: Only one useful card in dummy - @H8!|pg||
nt|raghavan: can use it now to ruff and lead C|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: normal contract that should go down|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok Mike, you win!|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|suketbombi:  ill timed sacrifice by Sunit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS will make 400 or so in 3NT though|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 500    against about 460 for 3nr by n/s|pg||
nt|raghavan: agreed but 3 IMP goes away from EW|pg||
nt|wolwerine: 3 NT with a heart lead is in trouble|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|raghavan: Clubs are not running|pg||
nt|raghavan: going 1 down - 1C+3D+1S|pg||

nt|robinswr: good guess with very little to go on|pg||
mb|1N|nt|daman: needs to be pushed though|pg||

nt|marlowepi: oh sorry, steve, thought you were addressing my comments about opening the bidding. i would also overcall 1S and double later|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all true, but how much can S reasonably hope for from a passe dhand|pg||
nt|drewsky: partner might think you are more like 6-1-3-3 or just a good hand with spades|pg||
nt|robinswr: schwartz has done many things that i havn't agreed with|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N is allowed to open the bidding in his partnership (as recommended by this shop), much easier|pg||
nt|drewsky: you will end up plauigna 5-2 fit instead of a 5-4 fit in a minor|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Now they are discussing richie's shape on previous board, richie says 5332, mike says 5422 pulls out last board and richie concedes|pg||
mb|p|nt|jimkrek: well 6s or 6ds here..but ds goes down on spade ruff|pg||
nt|jimkrek: true-sometime the aucgtion forces ur hand-which otherwise wd not happen|pg||
nt|stew: 4S ?|pg||
nt|bbramley: good point joanna|pg||
mb|2H|nt|fallenius: tough now for sontag to cooperate|pg||
nt|jimkrek: if sonty gives up the heart ace they will bid it|pg||
nt|daman: sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|jimkrek: morse cant believe the auction:)n|pg||
mb|3H|nt|fallenius: but bates may bid it never the less. he may be looking for seven|pg||
nt|pab1: auction rotated?|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: not so easy now|pg||
nt|mittmouse: if he leads a d we will have a new leader|pg||
nt|flash: just got a report that all the preparations have been made for overtime if needed...   |pg||
mb|4H|nt|daman: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|jimkrek: i gues 5c excl|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
nt|pab1: Operator, adjust auction please :-)|pg||
nt|daman: is that a super sized undo?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Lair, having forgotten the auction, asked if 2@c was Drury. Everyone laughing.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Short break|pg||
nt|robinswr: 4hearts will make with a diamond lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|fallenius: X and XX ??|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so mike doubled richie's desciption of his hand? how do you score that?|pg||
nt|drewsky: Schwartz told me on the phone between sessions that he needs 6 or more trumps to raise his partner|pg||
nt|drewsky: and a @D lead looks normal|pg||
pc|c9|nt|fallenius: usually not bad to RD if you think down two is highhly unlikely|pg||
nt|jimkrek: agree|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: I guess Dan didn;t think it was exclusion|pg||
nt|jimkrek: but|pg||
nt|flash: only a @C keeps defense alive and...|pg||
nt|robinswr: random between club and diamond|pg||
nt|drewsky: isnt it normal to lead your longer suit ?|pg||
nt|bbramley: normal to lead a "sequence"|pg||
nt|flash: top of a sequence (such as it is)?|pg||
nt|robinswr: i thought you're supposed to lead low from 98x so when you lead the 9 its always a doubleton|pg||
nt|flash: a spec has put in an order for Seagrams if we go to overtime...    (Henny Youngman and the lady with the dress with lots of Seagrams?)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jumpshift: maybe he was doing same...who knows :)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|robinswr: 4hearts is an overbid but preempts give opponents problems|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Onstott: "hmm, interesting"|pg||
nt|stew: it is interesting|pg||
nt|bbramley: or ducking a @D, either now or after another trump|pg||
nt|jumpshift: interchange the "curse" and the "beer card" and he would make this  (@D9 @D&)|pg||
nt|jumpshift: @D7|pg||
nt|mittmouse: that c lead was devestating|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and after that?|pg||
nt|wolwerine: After 2@C double is penalty. Pass would be forcing|pg||
nt|andyv:  far less complicated auction.. 1N - 3N|pg||
nt|wolwerine: Normally a bad idea to try to make up for a bad result|pg||
mb|1S|nt|raghavan: Tx Knut - Not only myself, some kibits asked me this - for them also useful|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i dont follow the hand was over defence can cash another 3 tricks declarer had his contract at that point|pg||

nt|xenya: donating their time and expertise to guide us through this set. And, of course, to all spectators. Hope you enjoyed the show.|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: yes agreed|pg||

mb|4N|nt|raghavan: no way to make even 7 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: push will make 5|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: there will be a short break after this board --- 2. half starts in about 20 min from now|pg||
nt|raghavan: deal 6 here 4S made in closed room sacrifice in 5D undoubled -1 so IMP 8|pg||
mb|5S|nt|xenya: well it appears that N thinks differently, Markku |pg||
nt|vugraphztn: North telling South that he is sorry he forgot system -- |pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|nt|don paulus: cc says - 2 @h = to play|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok ty all 4 watching and see ya tomorrow!|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is so special about this combined 20 points to produce  3N game?|pg||
nt|raghavan: play Spade may be good|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well defence can hold it to 4 now|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: not like that tho|pg||
nt|wolwerine: The Swedes had a good save in 7@H against 6@S where Lars went down in 6@C. They will be disappointed to findthat they lose 14 imps|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: if north had 10@S  this would now go down|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s4|nt|suketbombi: there is no futher interest left in the match good Luck to India and Pakistan for a mini final tommorow what time is it ?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: thanks to the efficent VU graph opertaors in Amman for making this happen.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|suketbombi: tommorow 1 pm Indian Time 10,30 Amman time we have the finals|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: was right to play club early    if he draws trumps and they dont break   could go down|pg||
nt|lestergold: agree |pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: Drew: "well played" Lair "what if I cashed the A of hearts earlier?" Discussion and general agreement that Onstott played it well but not clear if they could have beaten it anyway|pg||
nt|jimkrek: wondering that my self|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what good thing can gappen if you follow with the ten of hearts?|pg||
nt|bbramley: winning imps by NOT bidding game is a tough way to make a living|pg||
nt|flash: 7 IMPs; 4 boards...    watching BBO vugraph has been proved hazardous to the length of one's fingernails...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: I think this is more nerve wracking than it was playing Mon Tue, I knew the outcome of those matches|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: going to be hard for Schwartz to win IMPs on this board|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jimkrek: my thoughts on xx...i always think highly of my teammates...if i have slam X making this will be good..how much do i need?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pab1: it seems he might still get his Spade 10|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|robinswr: looks more like 6 spades and 4 diamonds than a Micheals bid|pg||
mb|3C|nt|flash: the one deflating aspect of having BBO vugraph is that the hallway comparisons have lost quite a bit of their tension...|pg||
nt|jimkrek: ritchie assure dthey push by the upgrade|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: alerted as something, if I caqn see the note I will tell you|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|jimkrek: interesting lead problem for bob j|pg||
mb|p|nt|stew: Yes... that's what I was thinking also.  Cash the heart Ace then play the diamond|pg||
nt|pab1: or force declarer to draw it, losing a cross ruff trick|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Berk: "3 and a quarter hearts" Drew: "wow" Berk "what do you mean wow, it's still a 6 count|pg||
nt|robinswr: probably shortness|pg||
mb|3S|nt|fallenius: The earlier the match is the better these "free" RD's maybe ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: 3c 11-13 bal or stiff club, 3d asks 3s tells|pg||
mb|p|nt|jimkrek: he knows heart cant be rt|pg||
mb|4N|nt|daman: in the CR they too are in 4@S on Board 26|pg||
nt|jimkrek: i like his choice|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|flash: shows 2 with the Queen because of the extra length|pg||
mb|p|nt|jimkrek: even though no reward|pg||
nt|robinswr: he'll problably lead back a club playing partner for the jack|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|nt|flash: Berkowitz - Lair in 5@D on 39; likely push|pg||
nt|robinswr: when both sides play the same suit, someone crazy|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Earlier Mike had commented that Richie is calmer playing with Bob than he has been with any other partner|pg||
nt|robinswr: someone said that North has shown up with 4sure hearts2sure diamonds, and probably 2spades therefore has 5clubs|pg||
nt|flash: Granovetter found the @C lead and Lair has misguessed @Ds; so game swing coming to Schwartz|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Richie responded that a hospital stay can change your whole outlook|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Bob Jones, Richies partner|pg||
nt|flash: always throws a slight curve at partner when he's looking at the Queen...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jimkrek:  having played alot with bob he is a great partner-im sure that has something to with it|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: jones woldn't play the 3 of hearts (encouraging) with a club honor|pg||
nt|flash: no outside King|pg||
nt|flash: push|pg||
nt|bbramley: but when he wakes up he likes it - those extra trumps are very handy|pg||
nt|robinswr: when partner is unlimited, you should bid 5nt to show all the keycards just in case partner can bid 7 knowing that|pg||
nt|jimkrek: its no curve-it tells him he can count 6 spades at least|pg||

nt|andyv:  go fish|pg||

nt|wolwerine: When North gets in with @CK he should play @HQ|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|jimkrek: and very solid...always has his bids|pg||
nt|robinswr: i'd rather play with someone who always bids|pg||
nt|flash: Granovetter (South) struggling in 2NT on this one...    another board where it'll apparently be difficult for Schwartz to pick up IMPs|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Vugraphu2: Drew: "could have bid 4@d and whacked you in 4@h and led a club - down 3"|pg||
mb|d|nt|robinswr: semi-forcing?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Richie comments that some who plays towards Qx missing AKJ probably already has his 9 tricks|pg||
nt|flash: negative X|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|jimkrek: the other table is a bit slower-so hard to know exactly how the match might be going|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: (same auction) - guess it's too tough to avoid 2NT...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jimkrek: feels like morse-wollff in control|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: better than defending 2@H doubled|pg||
nt|drewsky: I think 2@H doubled would go down|pg||
nt|jumpshift: except that if south passes the double...declarer likely to misguess the heart ten....|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fallenius: 3C took the edge off west's 3H bid hence 4H|pg||
nt|drewsky: exactly my thoughts Joanna|pg||

nt|daman: down 1 in 4@S on Board 26 in the CR|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Drew: "he shows 11-12?" Berk & Lair: "right"|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: If you promise to continue to call it a great gadget, I'll claim that Chip invented it :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Although might even have been me|pg||
nt|bbramley: dbl by north is aggressive, but i agree with both norths - N/S have the balance of power and should "own" the deal|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Vugraphu2: I can't tell you how many people have adopted it when we played it against them :)|pg||
nt|jimkrek: sure...more secrets revealed...|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jumpshift: Spec asks me if right to pass with north:  emphatically not, it may be a double part score swing (6 imps!)|pg||
nt|bbramley: if they don't own it, that's just too bad|pg||
nt|jimkrek: they had the perfect distribtion for the bid as well|pg||
nt|drewsky: the best that the declarers can do i down 2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|stew: On board 26 in the same position when Onstott played the spade J, Passell played Ace and a spade to Dummy|pg||
nt|flash: so 11 IMPs back to Lynch to tighten things back up|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bbramley: exchange the 8 and 9 of @Hs and N/S will do a lot better|pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: I think Berk may have miscounted tricks - all I know is that everyone claimed making and then Kit, who's kibitzing, asked what the result was and they started counting the tricks ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Berk had taken and finally figured out it was -1 and Berk apologized and said he could have made it|pg||
nt|robinswr: you have to but the blame on schwartz. if the opponents preempt and you don't and your teammates get to a bad spot then its your fault|pg||
nt|flash: next-to-last board in this room; playing board 40 in the other room|pg||
nt|bbramley: i can't recall anyone who doesn't play negative at 2 level these days|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: if that is a fully general principle, then it entails that any successful preempt was a good idea even before the outcome was known|pg||
nt|flash: re-start at the top of the hour; should have some boards left to watch on 'instant replay' in the Open Room|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: including a 4333 preempt that gets opps to wrong spot|pg||
nt|robinswr: preempts give the opponents problems|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no doubt about that anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: i play penalty doubles against 2-suited major suit bids neg doubles against 1-suiters|pg||
mb|p|nt|fallenius: 4 S with too much work here maybe as sontag planning to show limit w/ clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: sorry, couldn't see explanation of 1nt|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: with an alert|pg||
nt|fallenius: (!NT is played as a transfer by quite a few players nowadays) |pg||
nt|pab1: not sure why CLub finesse was not taken, just them|pg||
mb|p|nt|jimkrek: yes-alot of work but u wd like to be there for the fun of it...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Dan asked, 1NT was club transfer|pg||
nt|jimkrek: that wont excite bates for sure|pg||
nt|fallenius: Now sontag may bid 4S since 3S could be bid with 2-card|pg||
nt|jumpshift: Schwartz supporters will have to hope deal 60 is a bit livelier|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bbramley: this one would be livelier with East on lead|pg||
nt|chip: 2N went down 3 at the other table on the prior board, so closer.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: that is a lot of majot suit playability for a 2D bid (2/3 of points and nearly half the cards in the majors), but it is all about style|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|robinswr: i think the problem was whether to bid 3hearts or 4hearts but pass gives the opponents all the room and the last thing you want to giveflight B players is room. because even flight ...|pg||
nt|robinswr: B players know how to respond to a t/o double. Here you have world class opponents |pg||
pc|c2|nt|jimkrek: ur lead dan:)|pg||
nt|jimkrek: a throwup sort of lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Dan really thinking....|pg||
nt|gff: good for ontag noto preempt in clubd with 3[2 kajors|pg||
nt|gff: S|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Gene, many well wishers here for you.  Peggy S|pg||
nt|jimkrek: actually one of the hardest leads i ve seen|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jimkrek: no suit is neutral|pg||
nt|fallenius: yes. most leads gives declarer reasonable play on the layout|pg||
nt|poohbear: I am sure Berk would like to dbl as a gametry here but this new partnership had an accident the other day regarding a dbl|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||

pc|c5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|jumpshift: did he really block the clubs?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: restart in just over an hour|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: Players left for toilet break|pg||
nt|april7: andf how to get there?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS bid to 4@S on  33, but North declined to take the spade finesse - 5 more imps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: How did NS go down in 4@s on board no 33?|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: 1NT - 3 NT  :)|pg||
nt|wolwerine: I guess North was trying to make up for board 32|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: players back|pg||
mb|1H|nt|april7: NS might reach 3NT and again going down|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: 3NT makes on last board|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: EW to play in 4H |pg||
mb|4C!|an|splinter|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|april7: N might bid only 2NT??|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: or 2@H inquiring again about stopper|pg||
nt|april7: S needn't have A STOPPER IF HE BIDS !Nt|pg||
nt|andyv:  any reason for S to accept?|pg||
nt|wolwerine: Northe is not pushing NV|pg||
nt|april7: NO|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: e/w   likely to play in 4@H    will have to guess well to male|pg||
nt|ady: make|pg||
pc|sT|nt|raghavan: DK may be the lead - let us see|pg||
nt|april7: but after 2@H S bids only 2 NT and >N passes|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: I would think down 1|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|wolwerine: Maybe West should double - he knows they need points|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree with X. also with @dA|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|april7: but even 2NT doesn't make|pg||
pc|d5|nt|raghavan: Play Club A and DK - declarer may think that N has shown all points- S may have HQ|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h9|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|wolwerine: Normally you would be satisfied with 50 or 100, but West knows they are behind and the boards are running out|pg||

nt|daman: last hand of this segment|pg||
nt|pab1: are we all 3C pre-emptors, here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: short bathroom break (yes, they know it's the last board)|pg||
nt|stew: This hand  could pose some problems   easy to get too high I think|pg||
nt|pab1: after 1D opening|pg||
nt|flash: last board now; thnx to our operator, Bob Lafleur, for a great job|pg||
nt|bbramley: but WEST had the option at the end if he had blanked his @SQ|pg||
nt|flash: last board...   all the marbles and a trip to Sao Paulo|pg||
nt|jumpshift: 6@H on a finesse...loses|pg||
mb|1H|nt|daman: on Board 28 in the CR   Kasle is in 3NT|pg||
nt|stew: 3NT will make, but 4H will be down|pg||
nt|flash: thnx to our commentators for guiding us through the set; back in just over 40 minutes|pg||
nt|robinswr: if the bidding goes 1heart double 4hearts 4spades. the 4spades could be QJ10xxx and out|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is certyainly true that W should bid some bunch of hearts on the hand u r referring to, but also there is a lot to be said aagainst the way NS bid against the preemption in the ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: other room on that hand, world class or not|pg||
nt|jumpshift: looks like plenty of action here, fasten your seat belts|pg||

mb|p|nt|flash: stopped in 4@H next door, so....|pg||
nt|jumpshift: sorry, that was 5@H on a losing finesse....spade bids may push them|pg||
mb|4C|nt|marlowepi: still, the general point that W needed to bid is unassailable|pg||
nt|robinswr: 6hearts is on the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: writing on both sides of the table|pg||
nt|flash: it certainly looks as though congrats are in order to Carolyn Lynch, Mike Passell, David Berkowitz, Mark Lair, John Sutherlin and Dan Gerstman|pg||
nt|robinswr: i must say that i would bid 4diamonds with west's hand as a last train bid|pg||
nt|bbramley: but even 5@H can be beaten with a d! ruff|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: even so, i would not say W is the only culprit on the hand, only the most obvious one|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: if you're going to give blame, the number one is failure to preempt |pg||
nt|bbramley: @D ruff|pg||
