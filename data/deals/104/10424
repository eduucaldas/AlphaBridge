mb|3C!|nt|ahollan1: top seeds down in both matches  -- in the other   1 Larsen 13 vs  4 Morse 47|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: without DBL 2@H=5+@S  looks like no change here|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|robinswr: 2diamonds shows a contructive 2heart bid|pg||

mc|10|nt|ahollan1: at other table in our room Lynch-Passell playing Big Club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ekeblad also had option to open 1@C but downgraded his hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that translates to 15 imps for Schwartz|pg||
nt|ahollan1: let's hope this delay is Russ smoking and not another impending crash|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sorry, this is a bathroom break - I had to minimize the screen fast when someone went by me|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Will be back in a moment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: specs should know -- all tables are in unique room at hotel|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that lends itself to alot of player banter - Jan will let us hear some of it - but will act as a censor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the matches on vugraph right now are the USA1 [unbeaten] bracket to determine Senior Bowl team for upcoming Sao Paulo Brazil World Championships|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the losers bracket gives teams a second chance to become USA2|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|robinswr: if you're going to win trick. Before you win it have an idea about what you are going to do next. If all your followups are bad, maybe you shouldn't be winning that trick|pg||
mb|1S|nt|robinswr: he played too fast|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|lc: North's opening would have Al Roth and Charles Goren turning in their graves.|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu1: Jones: "ain't got nothin'"|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Berk: "OK, now back to the usual crap-o"|pg||
nt|lc: Not the worst game ever.  Basically on 3-2 trumps with queen onside.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: North hand is why some of us play 1N=10-12 :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lc: And why others pass.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|robinswr: in third seat, its right to open a 4-card major with a minimum opening|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|lc: Even if he were VUL, I'm sure declarer would have finessed -- trying to make it.|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: and that one, their opponents were Schermer-Chambers :)|pg||

nt|henryb: I could, although I bid 1@s over partner;s 1@h oversall with four card suits|pg||

nt|granovette: particularly if lair showed his hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|granovette: yes, gong would have to be not automatic, just when the hand is almost over and there's nothing anyone can do|pg||
nt|lc: I would defnitely be in there with 2@H -- especially opp passed partner.|pg||
nt|granovette: he is a sound overcaller|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i was going to ask -- what one change gets either 1@H or 2@H bid|pg||
nt|lc: Opposite PH I "Know" opps have game, so I want to become a pesdt.|pg||
nt|granovette: 6322 shape crummy|pg||
nt|lc: pest.|pg||
nt|granovette: yes, but sometimes you give away all the cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like quizzes like that -- my [ex]partners hate them|pg||
nt|granovette: they guess everything|pg||
nt|lc: Yup.  I know the hand stinks. But I don't like to give opps free run.|pg||
nt|granovette: easier to play the hands than when you keep quiet|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|lc: Sounds like we should write the next Partnership Bridge column together :)|pg||
nt|granovette: maybe they will get to 3NT which would be avoided if you bid|pg||
nt|granovette: who knows|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: with no bidding why would they guess the clubs|pg||
nt|lc: We've had these discussion before and we will just have to agree to disagree.|pg||
nt|granovette: everybody's style works on some hands - i think system choice, overcalling style, etc. is a personality thing|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|granovette: see?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N checking to see if 4@S or 3@S raise|pg||
nt|lc: I never like when my teammates come back to compare and say, "My opponents played perfectly."  I don't want to allow them the opportunity.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|robinswr: very reasonable guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Lynch asked Jones about the auction - "everything's natural"|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Schwartz: "one of those rule of 20 hands; not even one you would approve"|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lc: Score one for the Granovetter style!!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C = not 4@S -- not sure if it says anything else|pg||
nt|granovette: well, here we go! well done, hubby!|pg||
nt|lc: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1:  @c showed a minimum with 3 spades|pg||
