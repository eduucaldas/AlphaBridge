mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but still ...|pg||
mb|3H|nt|robinswr: 5diamonds fails but its a reasonable contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|robinswr: schartz could double this and get an extra 100|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: but he only has one sure trick|pg||
mb|p|pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: all it needs --- @HJ10x and @CQx  |pg||
nt|granovette: berkowitz is a good declarer; i think it's smart to bid aggressively when your partner can play the card well|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think Berk starts with the spade suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not to mention down 20-something|pg||
nt|granovette: right :-)|pg||
nt|poohbear: He does have 4 top losers|pg||
nt|poohbear: So not really ready to give the opps a 5th by playing @cs|pg||
nt|sam lev: I would pass 2NT, because nonvulnerable game is not the right odds with the east hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Sam - you would bid VUL, yes?|pg||
nt|granovette: i would too, but can understand bidding|pg||
nt|sam lev: yes|pg||
nt|granovette: sometimes partner has a five-card minor and both minor suit holdings work well, and sometimes partner has 5 spades...|pg||

nt|granovette: he knows matthew has no diamonds|pg||

nt|ahollan1: the "out loud" could be a deal breaker|pg||
nt|granovette: yes; what a burden to place on your partner|pg||

nt|granovette: your partner opens the bidding and you have two quick tricks, and you let them play a game undoubled|pg||
nt|granovette: because nobody doubles|pg||

nt|lc: In "Standard" the N-S auction would begin:   1@S-1N-2@C-2@S--??|pg||
