nt|lestergold: but south can stand a 2 spade contract thus had every reason to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and here we go |pg||
nt|sybarra: and slam to start our with |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 5c n/s|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland in 6C|pg||
nt|sybarra: this was hand that was up before |pg||
mb|2D!|an|multi|mb|2H|nt|lestergold: and closed room we see too|pg||
nt|lestergold: basically not unreasonable on a hook|pg||
nt|sybarra: Roland 6 @C,  I do not know what to do with the @D |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|lestergold: too good for Roland actually Roland in 7 makes on non heart lead and dim finesse |pg||
nt|sybarra: this is an unusual multi treatment |pg||
nt|henryb: to beat 6@c East has to cash one heart and shift to a spade|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: but the @D finesse loses |pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5S|nt|lestergold: Henry hi where did u appear from|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: West gets squeezed in hearts and diamonds|pg||
nt|sybarra: been suggested that multi could include a strong single minor suit hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Henry @H  welcome |pg||
nt|lestergold: i predict push|pg||
nt|henryb: and with the 2@h overcall, this is not unreasonable|pg||
nt|sybarra: explanation I just received:   2@d is usually played here as either weak major, strong minor or strong 4441|pg||
mb|7C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: so much for prediction |pg||

nt|henryb: For all of you grousing at me. What I said was that West had to cash a heart and shift to a spade to beat 6. I stand by that|pg||
nt|lestergold: u afre right Henry but no way do these boys play a squeeze in favour of a simple finnegle|pg||
