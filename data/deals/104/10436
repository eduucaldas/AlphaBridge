nt|kit: Smith could have pitched the king of spades at the end -- that would have made it clear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like other match is playing different set of boards but .. http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/    lets you open 1 window per vugraph room that you'd like to watch|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, queen of spades|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|kit: But I think Kasle should have figured it out anyway|pg||
nt|robinswr: when kasle led the jack of diamonds, and followed with the queen that shows hearts and therefore smith should have discarded his spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H limited by failure to open 1@C|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer's shape was known|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D/3@D from Sontag would NOT be Game Force, but hard to bypass search for @S|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|ahollan1: Kit - when playing Precision do you use 1@D-P-1@H-DBL;RDBL as 3@H Support?|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kit: Finally the spades are bid|pg||
nt|robinswr: 2hearts a control bid?|pg||
nt|kit: But does Bates know Sontag has 6 of them?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: transfer? oh  forcing noise|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: inquiry per sontag|pg||
nt|robinswr: natural would work better here|pg||
nt|kit: seems odd that the weak hand should be making the inquiry|pg||
nt|robinswr: would you open 1diamond with the north hand?|pg||
nt|kit: normally you would want the strong hand to be in charge|pg||
nt|kit: not playing Precision I wouldn't|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bates limited his hand with 2@D == if 19+ then 1@C-1@D;1@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we can only guess how that impacts other auctions|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|robinswr: i would open 1dia|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|robinswr: and will make it if it goes all pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bates-Sontag version of Precision  1@D=0-8 and positive responses begin at 9 HCP|pg||
nt|kit: let's see if Kasle has the courage to bid 2@H at unfavorable|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kit: nope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: also  1N opening is 15-17|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|kit: Sontag will probably just close his eyes and bid 3NT|pg||
mb|3H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Both 3NT and 5@C make at least|pg||
nt|robinswr: 2clubs shows a good hand so 3clubs shows a very good hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unfortunate duplication in @S to go along with no @C support and @D offside -- but 3N still rolls|pg||
nt|kit: but somebody has to bid the notrump if they are to get there|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kit: and now they are both scared to do so|pg||
nt|robinswr: if he had a strong 2 he could have bid 2hearts|pg||
nt|kit: might not 3@S be a real 5-card suit here?|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: would Bates bid 3@S instead of 3@H with 5+?|pg||
nt|kit: this could end it|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|robinswr: if he had 5spades he would have bid it before|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that's my thought also|pg||
nt|kit: well, they did seem to know what they were doing -- this is the best contract, as it makes if either the clubs come home or the ace of diamonds is on|pg||

pc|cA|nt|robinswr: assuming the queen of clubs is more likely onsides than the ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: I guess he decided that Kasle had to have ace of diamonds for the overcall.  Otherwise, his play is not percentage|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what did Sontag know that we missed?|pg||
mc|11|nt|ahollan1: sorry kit answered as my question was in the ether|pg||
