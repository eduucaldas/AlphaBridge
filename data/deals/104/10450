nt|reisig: 4-3-3-3 min = NO WAY|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sutherlin asks about signals: "upside down attitude, standard count"|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sutherlin: "any discards or anything?" Schwartz: "we did at the beginning of the tournament and then we stopped"|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Vugraphu4: sorry for the tech.dif......result to follow|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Sutherlin says he could have picked up the hearts for himself, which I guess is what they did in the other room|pg||
nt|robinswr: new leader again|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Passell asks Jones what his shape was - finding out he has stiff club he says "I couldn't coup you anyway" Then comments that it was their best slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu1: We'll try to keep these matches exciting to the end :)|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Jones "might not make 3NT" Passell "I had 10  in aces and kings" Jones "didn't see your clubs"|pg||
nt|pab1: Declarer might play Diamonds from his had, relying on one Heart finesse for his 7th trick|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: standard carding for NS|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: they are at trick 6... internet is awful... can't keep up |pg||
nt|ahollan1: hang in there Diane|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is hard enough for operator to follow play of cards when all things electronic are working well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when there is problem with connectivity or slow server -- it is BRUTAL|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: 4 for w 2 for s... just led low s to q and k... s thinks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and pray you don't need an UNDO - then things fall way behind :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from here - unable to tell if problem is with connections at hotel or on bbo server :(|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|pab1: with Hearts 3-3, he hs 7 tricks.  Only danger is if Souuth plays a Diamond through|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I have to go deal with something in another room - will just come back and claim the right number of tricks - you can all figure out what that is|pg||
nt|reisig: does this hand have any problems?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: just getting s on lead.. will follow from there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10 falls -- good news     bad news - trump splitting 41|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pab1: now declarer gets squeezed?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Schwartz "do you play Smith?" Passell "yes"|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: good news  can't misguess @C|pg||
pc|h9|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|pab1: Schwartz can discard one Diamond, but then what on the 5th Spade?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pab1: I don't like this line of play|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s7|nt|robinswr: he discards a heart and then leads to the diamond|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably spots NOT played that way|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|robinswr: last time schwartz had a balanced 20 he opened 1heart|pg||
nt|pab1: North did not figure out what Schwartz had done (unguarded his Diamond).  |pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|Vugraphu1: That particular bug always surprises me - being able to make an insufficient bid :) Sorry!|pg||

nt|reisig: Happy to have you - Steve|pg||
nt|po-s: if they play 4card majors...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|reisig: another 3N?|pg||
nt|reisig: by Schwartz|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: make sure you know in your partnership if that 2N is strong natural -- or some 2 suiter|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|robinswr: lucky declarer didn't have the ace of clubs|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|reisig: Not an easy hand|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3clubs 3hearts, 2spades and a diamond|pg||
nt|robinswr: if the queen is from qj doubleton anything works|pg||
nt|robinswr: therefore you have to assume its a singlton|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: 2n hearts and minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N was specifically @H + minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe thanks Diane|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|robinswr: now he needs 3heart tricks|pg||
nt|robinswr: or 2hearts and 2diamonds|pg||
nt|pab1: Declarer is safe as long as North has 4 Clubs.  |pg||
nt|robinswr: ducking the queen of hearts would have been an excellent play|pg||
nt|pab1: Lose two major suit finesses and 2 Clubs|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|robinswr: i don't think he has the timing for 2diamonds|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|robinswr: he can afford to lose a spade to south so maybe he plays the ak|pg||
nt|pab1: With 8 sure tricks, he's looking for one more.  He could look to Clubs or Spades|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|reisig: Now ...no play|pg||
nt|robinswr: he played for Jxx of hearts|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|robinswr: so he'll be d2|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|mc|9|nt|ahollan1: let's hope the superhighway traffic jam clears up soon so we can be confident about cards played AND tempo|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|reisig: Not the most exciting hand of the set here|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|ahollan1: 2N asks|pg||
mb|p|nt|pab1: E/W should reach 4S.  Should make unless they lose 2 Club tricks|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|robinswr: the auction will make it easier to guess clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|robinswr: looks like getstman upgraded his hand|pg||
nt|robinswr: not a clear lead from schwartz|pg||
nt|robinswr: trump is safe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry - not sure about 3@C, might have actually shown 3@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: says 3/1 either way or 2-2 no a or k|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|robinswr: suppose he leads a club|pg||
nt|pab1: No attractive lead for North|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a few options in the minor suits -- and must decide which order of choices|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would love a peek to see Wolff's @C holding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hard for us mortals to ignore seeing the EW hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Matt will NOT rush the play here|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: smoke and bathroom break while s thinks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you don't know first names of players:    W:Dan  N:Russ  E:Bobby  S:Matt|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: yes sorry for use of names... I'm updating now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might start @C hoping to get partial count on hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: either way must play @D for no loser|pg||
pc|d3|nt|robinswr: that is a strange lead|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|pab1: Sutherlin now hopes his partner has the 10 of Clubs.  That might be enough to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|robinswr: passell is playing middle hearts. I don't have anything|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c3|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s9|nt|robinswr: the percentage play in clubs is to take two finesses unless south had an opening bid|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: lost opportunity for the trailing team|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s7|nt|robinswr: better king|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|h2|pc|d5|pc|h6|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h9|pc|s5|pc|c8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my weird mind thinking if @D10 not held by opp  then tougher situation|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i may be stretching, but @D10 creates a Restricted Choice situation|pg||
mc|8|nt|kit: no, definitely no restricted choice here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought it was a stretch :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: winners of this match will be USA1 for upcoming Senior Bowl in Sao Paulo Brazil|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: sorry.. still can't get to new board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: losers of the match get to try another 60 boards to become USA2 -- they play winners of the Lynch-Kasle match [but after having the evening session to rest]|pg||
nt|kit: main argument for taking diamond finesse is simply that if declarer believes that opening leader has the 5-card spade suit, makes it more likely diamond length in East hand|pg||
nt|kit: if the opening lead were judged to be a 4-card suit, however, then more likely opening leader (if anybody) has length in diamonds|pg||

nt|pab1: and leads from the wrong hand, too|pg||
nt|robinswr: and insuffenicent bids|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: :) but I've got a few requests for Vugraph that are higher priority than that one :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pab1: It happens, even in the open trials :-)|pg||
nt|robinswr: anothe 6-6 hand|pg||
nt|pab1: how many wouuld bid 2H with North?  I would|pg||
nt|robinswr: i would|pg||
nt|robinswr: i have a feeling that we're about to be booted|pg||
nt|pab1: it feels like a bad cnx, at least for me|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Oh, it lets me make insufficient bids, but only if the stars are just right :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: good bidding getting to game after a strong notrump opener|pg||
mb|1N|nt|robinswr: guessing 4-card major and longer minor|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Gerstman wrote Meckwell - I think that means lots of different possibilities, but I'm afraid I don't know exactly what - Sutherlin wrote more but I can't read it (the bidding box ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: is now on top of it)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu1: Sutherlin wrote a long note - but then jokingly said to Jones "don't let her see it" I'm threatening to take away his pencil |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|robinswr: usually you don't get to game after a strong notrump opener|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Jones as dummy comes down "Again that looks like trump support; Richie I hope you're taking notes on this|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Jones: "I guess I have a cue bid, but it's a pretty ugly hand"|pg||

nt|ahollan1: so while we were in limbo -- Schwartz extends lead to triple digits|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|robinswr: probably ignoring the four spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: A more normal looking weak 2 bid this time |pg||
nt|robinswr: no outside 6-card suit this time|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: oops  sorry  Morse leads|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|robinswr: actually if you're not going down two and they won't save and you might make it, its percentage to redouble|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pab1: Good stop, but not low enough on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sutherlin asks for a review of the auction - it sounds just the way it looks on my screen|pg||
mb|p|pc|h7|nt|robinswr: why did schwartz think he had extras|pg||
nt|reisig: solid @ss?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: i;m hard wired and can't see as well but I'm speedy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well i blew typing name of leader and did bad math  only 99 imp lead for MORSE|pg||

nt|ahollan1: still 4 comparisons to come in this match -- and because of the crash don't trust the running total|pg||
nt|robinswr: i said that 4spades would make if spades were 2-1 since you can draw the trumps ruff a heart and lead a diamond|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|robinswr: since spades are 3-0 you can't stop the jack of spades from making with a club lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: s thinks|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|d4|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|robinswr: when you have a singleton honor its usually right to ruff with it|pg||
nt|robinswr: even ruffing partner's good trick if declarer is going to overruff|pg||
pc|c7|nt|robinswr: ruff with the king|pg||
nt|robinswr: how bad can it be to ruff with the king?|pg||

nt|robinswr: this is something that i wound't think about|pg||
nt|mittmouse: he knows partner has 2 h so he knows partner has 3d|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d6|pc|cT|pg||
nt|robinswr: the 5-2 spade fit with the 5-1 break played better than the 5-2 club fit with the 3-3 break|pg||
nt|robinswr: ruffing with the king gets a sure d2. this gives declarer options for d3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|c8|pg||

mc|8|nt|Vugraphu4: ok we'll go check scores and report back|pg||

nt|Vugraphu4: show should be better next segment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now if we all jump over to other room and cause the ship to list? |pg||
nt|mittmouse: so now probably only 70 odd imps down 5 imps a bd must play the last set|pg||
nt|po-s: 74 is another good one for Schwartz|pg||
