nt|geot: Board 1 may cause a swing, N/S won slam in the CR. Should not make on a spade lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|mariner1: nice slam|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Both South players opened a GF 2@C. That might not be everyone's choice|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: 2@C is...?|pg||
nt|mariner1: can NS find slam after a 2@C opener here?|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|werge: Nice 1 @H-opening in a NATURAL system |pg||
nt|buffytvs: so 2@H is Kokish and 3@D will show real hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: same opener in Closed Room though|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|geot: 980 is a huge result. Cant see how to win it if defenders cash their spade trick|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I agree -- don't like 2@C.  This hand isn'tr being passed out in 1@H|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|werge: An ACOL-2 can NEVER be 13 HCP, finito|pg||
nt|mariner1: isn't a @S lead from W hard to find?|pg||
nt|geot: but naturally west led the @DK|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|werge: Here the @D-bids should give West a chance|pg||
nt|geot: yes, very hard to find the lead. So if they bid it here it is likely to be a push|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/KokishRelays.html|pg||
nt|werge: No GeO, Krøj will NOT lead a @D after THIS bidding|pg||
nt|werge: - but might lead a @C, naturally|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hansen concealed his diamonds next door; wise move|pg||
mb|4S!|mb|d|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: thought that might happen|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Brøndum is taking part in a bidding-contest|pg||
nt|geot: You are right, Hans. West got some help from the bidding, and even more now by East's x|pg||
nt|mariner1: well N in Closed Room helped by raising @H|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: North was unable to here, because 2@H was ambiguous|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's the price you pay when you add conventions to your card|pg||
nt|mariner1: a slam based on a lead with NO dbl is certainly reasonable,,, here the DBL was|pg||
nt|mariner1: made|pg||
nt|geot: It depends of course on methods, but I like the 3@H raise over 2@H, showing values as most players play it. |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: You can't do that if you play Kokish, GeO|pg||

nt|werge: One down in 5?|pg||
nt|geot: Is 5 in danger?|pg||
