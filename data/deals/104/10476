nt|kaapo: 1NT might be 11-13 or so|pg||

nt|Jacki: Does someone in here need to be ungagged to comment?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: In my opinion N's @Ds aren't good enough for a 4NT overcall|pg||
mb|2H|nt|MolvaM: bazý ellerde vugraf operatörleri oynanan kartlarý yanlýþ girebiliyorlar ama sonradan düzeltiyorlar|pg||

nt|kastan88: he was faster (West)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Simonsen is thinking|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|davidb: Sp 3-3 so 6H makable|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: belki de 10-12 dir?|pg||
nt|eerbil: tek þansýmýz oynayanýn trefl asýný ilk 2 turdan birinde almasý, ki pek olasý bir oyun deðil|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ingiltere takýmý da genel klasman 11.si|pg||
nt|kaapo: 4@S is a great contract and 5@D an excellent sacrifice|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: France are at the moment at the top of the U26 group|pg||

mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: Yers|pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: yes.|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, you can sustain a bad diamond break (or guess) in clubs more easily than in diamonds.|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vdoubleu: Yes, key here.|pg||
nt|kareno: Only a club gives away nothing.|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: Why?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: confirmed 4d= blackwood 4s 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with no X of 4S, may avoid that suit on lead|pg||

nt|wwalter: gm everyboady, very nice swing :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hi all|pg||
nt|waso: hiii|pg||
nt|kaapo: First board, which we mostly missed, was a push. The double on board 2 brought Latvia the first 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|kaapo: More wild distributions|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would have overcalled 2@c   but if I was going to bring @ds in I would bid 2NT|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4NT is excessive|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree,  seemed a bit much|pg||
nt|sybarra: that lovely sp suited opened in both rooms |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: The strength of your hand are the @Cs, not your distribution per se, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: ercan-gündoðdu güzelce oynamýþlar þlemi ama sanýrým pek alýþveriþ olmaz bu elde|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: It appers that NS could make 7@D|pg||
nt|kaapo: But perhaps they'll stop at 6|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2D!|an|diam + 1 major|nt|poohbear: Ok that was easy|pg||
nt|kastan88: IMO problem starts from South bid 3@S, he may see probable misfit, but we must remember these ara juniors, so blood is hot|pg||
nt|sybarra: now how do you play 2 nt here?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Not so sure I would overcall 1NT here, I like 2@D|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kaapo: My second guess is that NS play polish club|pg||
mb|p|nt|ozgull: juniors ta belli olmaz:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ilk fýrsatta key card sorulmasý gereken bir el ama asýl sorun grandþlem var ise onu kaçýrmamak|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: interesting |pg||
mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|waso: maybe 1nt 16-18|pg||
mb|3D|nt|davidb: very conservative 2 passes by S |pg||
nt|MolvaM: kuzey açýsýndan grandþlemin anahtarý minör renklerdeki yan onörler|pg||
nt|kaapo: Where 1@C could be of several varieties|pg||
nt|kaapo: Here minimum balanced hand|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 5@S losing 2@H and a 1C|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: *@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: bu bakýmdan bir þekilde karo üzerinden keycard sormayý denkleþtirmek iyi fikir olabilir|pg||
nt|ozgull: karo k pik as olsa mesala 13 hcp|pg||
nt|eerbil: Ingiliz takýmý zon durumuna göre deðiþken 1NT açýþý kullanýyor gibiler, uygun zon durumu 10-12 olsa gerek|pg||
nt|MolvaM: böylece koz dam'ýný da öðrenebilir|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Latvia dont alert the 3-rd dbl:)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugraphztr: one down?|pg||
nt|waso: yes|pg||
nt|waso: one of each|pg||
nt|wwalter: 3@h was a little optimistic :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: team style|pg||
nt|kaapo: A kibitzer has read in the bulletin, that NS would play strong club|pg||
nt|kastan88: interesting, how now EW will find their spades game, I would bid 2nd round 2@S with E hand, IMO showing 7...20 with 5-card @S|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hard decision 4 Mr. Lauks|pg||
nt|kastan88: now it is hard to West find good bid another than pass|pg||

nt|tomi2: this looks like some 2 way checkbac auction|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2D seems to be a GF chec back or relay|pg||
nt|tomi2: souths 2@D is artifical and gameforcing, says nothing about @D's|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well this seems bullet proof for NS|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 3NT was in fact suggested by a kib|pg||
nt|sybarra: we can refil coffee 's |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Haha, yeah|pg||
nt|poohbear: not exactly a nobrainer 6C could have been bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: no brainer in 3 nt  |pg||
nt|sybarra: but you are right Barry |pg||
nt|poohbear: perhaps. Should that be East's bid? |pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: should be a normal board|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: the players must've heard him/her|pg||
nt|rodal f: Other room roads splitted at 2@C. There 2@D|pg||
nt|gh1: i think is dificult too bid 7 now|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep |pg||
mb|3D|nt|poohbear: need a @c lead or a @s lead and a @c shift|pg||
nt|poohbear: for the defense to prevail|pg||
nt|gracelin: usually it's played over a 1NT rebid, but here they extended to any rebid.|pg||
nt|tomi2: now he will support partnesr spades showing 4 card support and 12+hcp whil a direct jump to 4@S would indicate more shape and less high cards|pg||
nt|gracelin: could beat it with a low H lead |pg||
nt|tomi2: spade bids below 4@S would have been invitational to slam after 2@D|pg||
nt|gracelin: but really tough under the bidding|pg||
nt|tomi2: but after south bid strong and his screenmate even thinks now ot go on maybe east should try some agressive lead|pg||
nt|gracelin: Any other lead will see 4S home|pg||
nt|tomi2: "they are thinking of taking more than 10 tricks and I must hold them to 9 - then I need some miracle"|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mr. Simonsen does not appear to like passing just yet|pg||
nt|gracelin: but it's always the case when opponent bid to a game|pg||
nt|tomi2: does anybody know if N/S are a long time partnership?|pg||
mb|p|nt|syl: the pld rebid problem: 1@d-1@S-? 1444|pg||
nt|rodal f: E are asking in 4NT so exlution gone there|pg||

mb|3H|nt|MolvaM: kör ataðýna zorlanýr mý?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: do U think they know abou diam fit?:)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|tomi2: maybe north took 4@S as some splinter bid for either hearts or dias or so? I am just suggesting|pg||
nt|gracelin: As thomas said, south will bid less spades after 2D if he has slam ambition|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 'about'|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why don't E show the @D support?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: when?|pg||
nt|gh1: i think he bid 4dia now|pg||
mb|p|nt|waso: u teach bridge at schools?|pg||
nt|syl: *old|pg||
nt|syl: nope|pg||
nt|waso: only clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: After 2@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: do U think 3clubs is diam support?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|davidb: same bidding same contract in OR|pg||
nt|ozgull: direkt 2NT birþeye tranfer olduðu için böyle yapmak zorunda olsa gerek|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2 kör, 2 karo ve 1 trefl lövesi?|pg||
nt|eerbil: kör ataðý gelse de defans trefl lövesine yetiþemiyor|pg||
nt|gracelin: or north treated 4S as kick-back with Heart agreed ?|pg||
nt|tomi2: zatorski chose the safe way of just raising to 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mr Skjetne is surprised to have the tray returned back empty|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: sonuç olarak bu borddan kaybýmýz olmayacaðýný görmek iyi|pg||

nt|ozgull: en azýndan karoyu bilmesi lazým|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|tomi2: because partner did not reverse and they are plying together just this year because Wiankowskis Partner is too old for this event|pg||

nt|kaapo: *was bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: J@C was found? Adrian|pg||
mb|3N|nt|poohbear: I believe Ruso should bid to define her hand once partner responds. I would bid 2@c'|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: not good|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 5clubs in 1st seat|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe without the ace of diam|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2 pairs collected 1100 defending against 2@HX|pg||
nt|kastan88: occasionally West @D was 32, so was difficult to East assume, that partner 2 is from doubleton, probably Jxx|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphztr: yes|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: well W must not have realized the 2@S was a game try here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bazý çiftler kontrdan sonraki koz tutuþlarýný göstermek için transferli deklareler oynuyorlar|pg||

nt|syl: 5@C NOW|pg||
nt|gracelin: with those weak spots, I would not be interested to penalize opponents in 2D, so would Cue 3D instead.|pg||
nt|kaapo: However, all tabes should find a slam here|pg||
nt|kaapo: North would now like to ask for aces outside of spades|pg||

nt|tomi2: yes|pg||

mb|d!|nt|mariner1: 4@S best NS spot|pg||
mb|2H|nt|gracelin: bery rare to see a passed out board in youth eent.  They get matured|pg||
nt|gracelin: very|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps NS bid another 3NT here?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Although it might not be that great on a @C lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 1@C is Polish @c|pg||
nt|lestergold: only making game for n/s 4s tho 5dims can be let thru|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maçlar 20 boardluk|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1D probably showed H, and 2H confirmed 4-card support|pg||
nt|gracelin: With half his honors in opponents' suit, south better contend with 3H or a try|pg||
nt|kastan88: after 1@S vuln from West, how many points in @S will put North into partner's hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: W maybe should bid 3@c over XX?|pg||
nt|babydolldk: Unless you lead a @H 6@D is only 1100 v. 1370:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: This is a forcing Pass by E|pg||
nt|ozgull: bu arada girls romanya ya karþý 30 - 5 önde|pg||

pc|d2|nt|lestergold: well south having shown his spades first presumably this will be played in spades now|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: 1NT from Aurelie!!!:)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Board 6 is at the moment recorded as round pass in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: a director asked to look at my movie and went to check|pg||
nt|kaapo: That shuold be fixed soon, when they actually play the board|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: nope|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh well, also missed the 4@S, tough hand to land right|pg||
nt|mariner1: I guess 5@S can make too though|pg||
nt|lestergold: after 4d it wa surely correct fopr north to give preference to spades he had al reay bid the pips off a 6 card heart suit with poor intermediates|pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure that is possible either|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a lost opportunity for a swing here unless north 'corrects' to spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe 2 clubs is checkback|pg||
nt|kastan88: and that's it, if partner not having any points in spades, where are his 12 points for opening?, still could ask for aces, IMO|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Lauks and the two aces from his hand:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and he said: one down will be enough|pg||
nt|rodal f: Should become a flat board by normal defence|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mariner1: in Open Room S bid @S twice and they still did not get to 4@S|pg||
nt|gracelin: a spade lead, club shift and duck, will beat even 3H|pg||
nt|kastan88: here is clear, that NS  have not the same pinion about pass over 2@S doubled from South hand. But such situations need to agree exactly. showing this 1 stopper or half stopper or ...|pg||
nt|kastan88: nothin in spades, or just minimum hand whatever, but agreement needed|pg||
pc|d5|nt|charles_l: its pretty much 16+ with @c, what he has|pg||
nt|gracelin: This maximum defense is in fact a reasonable one|pg||
nt|kaapo: On this lead, EW could keep South out of his hand|pg||
nt|kastan88: sr for mistyping. opinion , not pinion :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|charles_l: (assuming polish @c)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Not much excitement - only they have not reached a makeable C slam|pg||
nt|mariner1: a none @c lead allows a make|pg||
nt|mariner1: non|pg||
nt|lestergold: now Jones ha to find the killing club lead |pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@s will not fare well\|pg||
nt|kaapo: But @Hs are splitting, too|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: and he has|pg||
nt|poohbear: even with that lead not much declarer can do to avoid going 2 off|pg||
nt|poohbear: Best to win in Dummy and play a @c to try to negotiate a ruff|pg||
nt|poohbear: alternatively if you trust the lead you can draw trumps and if 3-2 play for 4 @d tricks and then lead a @c off dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Brian Senior is here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: making pictures|pg||

nt|rodal f: An X will cost at the 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i mean who is going to play a heart tghe other way then losing the chance of finessing against the tenof hearts if th hearts break 4/1 the other way|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3 nt with lots of chances after the @c lead and the king wins|pg||

pc|d9|nt|babydolldk: On board 7 they bid 6@C|pg||

nt|davidb: should misgueese all to go down|pg||

nt|kaapo: Rather bid 3NT straight away|pg||
nt|kaapo: That might be possible, with AKK and T9|pg||

nt|MolvaM: kuzey bu kontru ceza niyetine attý ama güney bunu çözebilecek mi?|pg||

nt|ritong: might have worked finding opener with say @h Jxx and no @s loser, but, as any very marginal shot, this unlikely, so costs on the long run|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gracelin: 7c is a good proposition if West has Kxx of clubs instead|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C is alerted because they respond 2@C also on balanced hands even with spade fit, so it could be on 2 cards only|pg||
nt|gracelin: so only 4C confirmed the club fit|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2nt is forcing and 3@C confirms some support|pg||

nt|robinswr: no 4th seat preempts say that you think you have plays for game but not for slam|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|scotty: right , but since you think partner needs to know which values are important, it must mean that you deny singleton or void|pg||

nt|robinswr: just a guess and how is partner supposed to know|pg||

nt|mariner1: ty Mike|pg||
nt|ritong: three down looks normal|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bessis bid a quiet 2@d in the OR and played there|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ingiltere takýmý 1@c açýp bir sürü þlem buluruz diye hazýrlanmýþ ama rahat býrakmýyor rakipler|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6@c sizce nasýl kontrat?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ah, I see we lost 2 board :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT was mini|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 2@D looks like a 2-way Stayman|pg||
nt|kaapo: Which is a gameforcing relay|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2NT denies 4c majors, and probably also denies 5-card minors|pg||
nt|kaapo: 3@S shows 5|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 3NT shows 2 @S|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: Grosset needs to unblock|pg||
nt|kaapo: This shows a draw back in 2-way Stayman|pg||
nt|kaapo: Since West hasn't got 4@H nor 5 cards in a minor...|pg||
nt|kaapo: And he has 2@S...|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|charles_l: find the @cQ for 3N|pg||
nt|raghavan: breather given by defense|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3NT shouldnt be too difficult . Declarer prob just unblocks spades and ducks a @c|pg||

pc|cQ|pg||

nt|kaapo: This appears to be going down now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphztr: thinking|pg||
nt|hedyg: because when he stops to think he either had a stiff K@C or is thinking to switch|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|d|nt|robinswr: when there is a singleton in dummy, the normal signal is suit preferance |pg||

mb|2S|nt|robinswr: yes|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: That is how most play it.|pg||

nt|kareno: Needs less from partner to help also.|pg||
nt|scotty: Against 1N-3n, you might find some spade leaders|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and most would bid with the S hand if nonvul i think|pg||
nt|robinswr: or some diamond leaders|pg||
nt|robinswr: good lead problem for 1nt 3nt|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|scotty: But if partner has nothing in the suit you lead, a spade might well turn out better, if E has both honors or W has Hx.  But I would lead a heart|pg||

nt|mariner1: EW in Open Room are in a tough 3N here|pg||

nt|kaapo: 1@C was likely strong (or Polish), and 1@D negative|pg||

nt|hedyg: he is indeed, even if he misguessed the @ds here|pg||
pc|h6|nt|eerbil: Güney ilk trefli almasa defans biraz daha kolay olabilirdi|pg||
nt|sybarra2: never to see dummy again |pg||
pc|c6|nt|davidb: good bidding by EW . play should not be a problem|pg||
nt|poohbear: no reason to overruff when there is a loser to pitch|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes if you play both suit "with the odds" then you lose, but I think N did not bid his 5 cards in the OR, so E lead a heart and I guess W shoed his count|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|poohbear: EW needed totake the @d ace before plying the @c|pg||
nt|syl: crossruffing may be superior|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: @HQ lead in the other room solved a lot of problems for declarer|pg||
pc|h7|nt|babydolldk: last chance|pg||
nt|raghavan: HK and a Heart may be a good defense|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: director calls for half time|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: ms Hoderova again pondering her next move|pg||
nt|charles_l: no- too much for 1@d response i think|pg||

pc|c4|nt|babydolldk: :) |pg||

nt|vugraphztr: the thinking ball is now in mr. Wiankowski's court|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: spade|pg||
nt|poohbear: anything else is risking the contract|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mariner1: I expected England to gain here and instead they will lose a big swing|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hedyg: much needed imps to Italy|pg||
nt|ritong: right, heavy score til now|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and sliding home to 1 @S |pg||
mc|10|nt|athene: i think many people do lead partner's suit too often - a lot of experts avoid it and look for something unexpected if opps bid confidently to 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: for example there was a hand in the finals of the US trials a few weeks back|pg||
nt|athene: when rodwell overcalled 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: and meckstroth led a heart from @HQJxx instead of a spade|pg||

nt|gracelin: declarer is under no pressure in 4H.  But if he were in slam, the normal way is to go wrong in both major suits|pg||

nt|rodal f: A practic bid:)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|charles_l: E may sac in 4@s over 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I like this kind of bidding:)|pg||
nt|gh1: i think 4s-1 with right def, and spade switch fore -1|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|poohbear: Especially if EW can bid 2NT scramble |pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@d is a game try|pg||
nt|poohbear: South should reject|pg||
nt|ritong: declarer needs five @c tricks, he will find them whatever his choice so big hit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Montanari sees no defensive tricks vs 6@D.....|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he might bid 6@s|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nope|pg||
nt|eerbil: bu kadar öndeyken alýþveriþ ihtimali düþük eller gelmesi hoþ biþey|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mariner1: N sure has a lot to be passing 3@D|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, particularly when he holds @sAK, his pard very likely has an 8 bagger|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|raghavan: West will pass |pg||
nt|davidb: if N is short in Sp , S hand is not so good . ok to pass Nv'  |pg||
nt|hedyg: would have been -4|pg||
nt|hedyg: Grosset "the thinker" might take a while to play this|pg||
nt|ritong: he has no real alternative|pg||
nt|rodal f: Need @S returne for set the contract NOW|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|charles_l: if Z rebid 4@s it might go ppp...?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ms. Hoderova is playing the bartender now|pg||
nt|raghavan: N should try spade ruffs before drawing trumps |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: has left the table in order to procure drinks|pg||
nt|tomi2: west chose to pass 2@H - it's quite popular in Poland a) to upgrade lots of 14's to 1NT and b) to superaccept on maximum and 3 cards support - so he chose to pass 2@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2H is probably making.  Nice stop by Sikora |pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|vugraphztm: S thinking.......|pg||
nt|syl: bold bid this 3nt|pg||
nt|gracelin: unless declarer misguessed D after north ruffs club and return a low D.|pg||
nt|kaapo: North has only 3 hearts, so after (taking @H finesse and) ruffing a @H, EW can draw trumps and then raise the @S trick|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Bech explains to Lauks that his part's hand is a REALLY bad 13|pg||
nt|sybarra2: take no finesses.... |pg||
pc|d4|nt|poohbear: 3@h is a counter Game try|pg||
nt|poohbear: perhaps North should accept that|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@D was an artificial GF|pg||
nt|kaapo: And I suppose 3NT means what Florin told|pg||
nt|kaapo: This should go 1 down|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mariner1: @H lead helps declarer|pg||
nt|hedyg: that helps!|pg||
nt|sybarra2: bang down aces and kings  |pg||
pc|dK|nt|mariner1: probably always makes 5 though|pg||
nt|athene: south has bid north's hand for him here|pg||
nt|athene: north passed 3@D and then bid only 3@S over the second double|pg||
nt|athene: saying "I don't have anything, partner!"|pg||

nt|gracelin: did C9 call for spade ?|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes but nopbody leads from Q into jx when xxx in spades is also available|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kaapo: I held a elementary bridge class a while back, and I kind of remember the book stating something about 33 HCPs for a slam|pg||

nt|kaapo: So perhaps Bech could've settled for 3NT|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra2: easy from here of course|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s4|nt|athene: south raised to 4@S, saying "don't lie, i know you have lots really!"|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 1@C Polish @c|pg||
nt|poohbear: it was indeed 7 to Russia on the 1@h hand. NS played 3@c in the other room. That was 2 high|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, some players play cards very fast - some don't place their card clearly enough on the table (or the screen hides it)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 2@H seems to be the (in)famous Muiderberg, as we call it, 5@H, 4+m|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|davidb: 1Nt opening 14-16 won the prevoious board|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D perhaps an underbid in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: five trumps and an ace...maybe worth 4@D|pg||
nt|athene: wld be nicer with two spades and the stiff in hearts, admittedly|pg||
nt|athene: (or that's what north probably thought) :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers asking for 6@D here|pg||
nt|kaapo: The South hand here seems to me at least as good as the one North opened 1@C on  13|pg||
nt|kaapo: Even though it has 1 HCP less.|pg||
nt|kaapo: Now, in a limited opening system...|pg||
nt|kaapo: South might have a was to show a maximum opening with 6@H and 3@S|pg||
nt|kaapo: Like 2NT|pg||
nt|kaapo: *way (instead of was)|pg||
nt|kaapo: This might be yet another case for 3NT with a good 6-card major|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: which probably he cant remember now as he is staring at the (very high) ceiling|pg||
nt|sybarra2: muiderberg or funky tartan?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 2NT asking which m|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ritong: anyway, grosset is " cricri" on BBO and i can say that he is a super nice guy|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3NT is on NS any lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: and now is the time to bid it|pg||
nt|gracelin: Now a lucky grand slam bid by Norway in open room|pg||
nt|othered1: we can see if it gets in the way of a constructive auction|pg||
nt|sybarra2: E pleased to hear it is @C |pg||
mb|4S|nt|charles_l: i think 4@h is a practical bid - not dbl|pg||
nt|poohbear: Ruso should lie by dbling if she feels obligated to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i would have opened a 20-21 2NT with the 2 10s and 9@d|pg||
nt|usla: matchpoints dbl in OR, saka style:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sorunsuz|pg||
nt|tomi2: just getting some bets that polish players wont bid the grand, but my experience against sikora and nawrocki is that they will :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2N shows the bid hand with little @c help as he has|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: !!|pg||
nt|poohbear: She rebid 3@h?|pg||
nt|poohbear: would think she would be thrilled to raise NT|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and now Mr. Osipov.... pass:)|pg||
nt|ritong: the fact that he takes his time playing this important event is rather a good thing, i add|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure it is|pg||
nt|ozgull: düz bir el daha|pg||
nt|tokay1975: bu elide cozduler pastan gelen ortaga  dbl muthis|pg||
nt|tokay1975: kesinlikle pas derdim ben alakam olmazdi|pg||
nt|kaapo: So 3@H now could either show exactly 3@S - or deny 3@S. South just doesn't know which :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit passive by E? 2@C as bid for anyone?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: shaka style= 5 clubs:)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|charles_l: unless 4m=m+@h|pg||
nt|babydolldk: if you play leaping michaels maybe 4@C...|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt showed the strong version of 1@C? what wld south do with the weak NT? pass 2@C?|pg||
nt|gracelin: Sikora may still regret on  11 when they stopped in 6C but trump K was onside for seven.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|babydolldk: :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: good decision by N 4SX goes 2 down VUL -500 where as now only 450|pg||
nt|charles_l: between dbl & 4@h, guys?|pg||
nt|babydolldk: D|pg||
nt|mariner1: Q10 @D comes down so this will not take long|pg||
nt|kastan88: disaster in Open Roome here, after quite similar bidding as here, IMO North can't bid 3NT with only 1 stopper, double much solid decision,|pg||
pc|c3|nt|tomi2: Sikora is a gabmler and Nawrocki not so when West has the final decision to make...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: good lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep:)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|gracelin: 7D makes on 2-2 diamonds or singleton Q, altgether about 52.5% chance|pg||
nt|kaapo: Although, of course they may not have that kind of agreement at alk|pg||
pc|cA|nt|poohbear: This will not do well|pg||
nt|tomi2: 7@D always makes when Sikor is playing and Qxx(x) is not offside ;)|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am sure he won't go wrong here.  That's a safety bet.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: 4 @h = cue at this point |pg||
nt|sybarra2: (just a guess) |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Johansen just explained it as such|pg||
nt|othered1: Now has to find the @CQ.  Never got their good @S fit in, however.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|MolvaM: demek sen de yaþlýsýn tokay|pg||

pc|c4|nt|tokay1975: ole gozukuyo:))|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: e n-am fost atent|pg||
nt|gracelin: Nawrocki adopted the scientfic approach by asking trump Q|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes he would have to as 2@C was not forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: now claim 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: now you can shorten matters cricri|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: only 7 looser|pg||

nt|gracelin: thedenial|pg||
pc|h4|nt|MolvaM: son 5 borda giriyoruz|pg||
nt|kastan88: Now South had to decide to leave 3@S doubled or look for minor contract (that he mentioned with good-bad 2NT)...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I think is not a classical good / bad NT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kastan88: yes, but similar their|pg||
nt|kastan88: *there|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|hedyg: just claim the reds :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: junior bridge nowadays is good!|pg||
nt|tomi2: hmm lost my bet :(|pg||
nt|tomi2: but sikora will find the @DQ anyway so i was kind of right|pg||
nt|gracelin: Sikora can't be sure that partner has four trumps, otherwise he knows the only problem was trump Q and he would find it.|pg||
nt|kaapo: Spade loser goes on a @D so this is as good as 3NT as it is|pg||
nt|sybarra2: who leads from qxx?  or x of @C on this auction |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphztr: they are thinking and I'm sleeping (a little bit) :)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|charles_l: if i D then 4@h i expect W to move with @sA and @hQ10x|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kastan88: good play from West here, he must put declarer under pressure at once, another way dias will be thrown on good hearts|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit more aktivity at the other room so X came natural|pg||
mc|9|nt|usla: after 3 @C pre W hand count what tricks?|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: i.e. what does double mean?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: is a new suit forcing or non-forcing?|pg||

nt|tomi2: yeah Europans are 20 boards each wihle World Championships are 16 boards and also 3 segments|pg||

nt|athene: yes, 4major+1 is the most common boring flat board by a long way|pg||
nt|MolvaM: açýk odada birisi kontr demeyi unutmuþ. çok iyi skor|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@S - pass - pass - dbl?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|MolvaM: bu 5 kör deklaresine ne buyrulur?|pg||

nt|kaapo: Ah, West bid 1NT|pg||
nt|kaapo: I'm glad I didn't buy a lottery ticket today ;)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@D is around 11-15 if unbalanced or 13-16 balanced|pg||
nt|kaapo: So East is quite maximal and might find a move|pg||
nt|kaapo: I suppose Bethers isn't thinking, but Arvidsson|pg||
nt|othered1: Game in either pointed suit is possible NS, but may not be easy to handle|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: just needs K@C in pocket (and reasonable @S and other breaks) for slam|pg||

mb|p|nt|davidb: W dreaming of KQ spade & A cl for a slam|pg||

nt|mariner1: and E might have an important card too, and does here with K@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: well S should win A@C and pull @S and lead a @c|pg||
nt|athene: @CA, draw trumps|pg||
nt|poohbear: Who are they?|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D confirms the strong variant of polish club and asks partner for further information|pg||
nt|tomi2: 3@C confirmed 5 hearts and some extras, 3@H sets trumps and starts slam investigation|pg||
nt|po-s: absolutely - East has max 15|pg||

pc|s3|nt|poohbear: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes ty Adrian|pg||
nt|gracelin: 5 is probably exclusion RKC|pg||
nt|tomi2: 5@D asks for keycards outside the @D suit, but unfortunatly east has a hand where he could even pass this|pg||
nt|tomi2: I am asked why undos are accepted in this match, I can explain you:|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: when you see an undo it means in 99% of the cases, that the operator made a misclick|pg||
nt|tomi2: and not one of the players|pg||
nt|kastan88: 1@H= 7...11 , 3+@H|pg||
pc|sK|nt|othered1: cue-bid at south's second turn, unless a transfer to @D, wouldn't be everyone's choice.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|tomi2: one poor guy is sitting close to the table and tries to record the cardplay for all of us here in BBO|pg||
nt|tomi2: most often players play either very slow or very fast, so in the "fast" case it is hard to follow all cards and bids|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mr Sikora is now counting on his fingers :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: Nawrocki was surely imagining counting on his fingers|pg||
nt|gracelin: 5NT shows two but I onkt see 1 key card outside D in East's hand.|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: must've gone wrong somewhere. restarted the count|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes something is wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: probably the false 5nt is giving him headache|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would expect 2 keycards and no @HQ from east using my fingers to count|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|poohbear: yes girl Make them pay|pg||
nt|MolvaM: we can do turkish commentary in one room in ALL of the matches of turkey. no problem. just let me know|pg||

pc|s8|nt|vugraphztr: and Aliosja Asanovici's dbl:):)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 19 deðil 10 olacak pardon|pg||
nt|othered1: They seem to know what they were doing, however.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: but there is just no way west is underleading the @CK here|pg||

nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Bulletins.htm  -  Bulletins (PDF's|pg||
nt|mariner1: Work)|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he can certainly ruff @H if E cashes the K@C|pg||
nt|athene: are we still here?|pg||
nt|mariner1: ruff HIGH|pg||
nt|kaapo: A good point yes, you aren't really going anywhere (but trouble perhaps) by bidding|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mariner1: E hoping there is a play that is hard to see, there isn't|pg||
nt|gracelin: the 3rd step 5NT should show 2 key cards without HQ, so West knows someting is still missing for the grand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did S miss?|pg||
nt|gh1: he sleep home now|pg||
nt|rodal f: @SA - and a new @C.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|charles_l: maybe he distusts W's bidding 3@d|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: the Ace holding mr. Simonsen is now asking for a recapitulation of the bidding|pg||
nt|tomi2: this needs some "thorowaway" squeeze|pg||
nt|gracelin: but from east's point of view, if no key-card is missing, he wants to be in seven|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|tomi2: west was probably asking for 3rd round kontrol in clubs and E thought he made no mistake and had this control and running tricks|pg||
nt|gracelin: good lead, save everybody time and energy|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: now mr Simonsen is asking for a recapitulation with his partner :)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|MolvaM: türkiyenin maçýnýn verilip verilmeyeceði yarýn sabah belli olacak|pg||
nt|tomi2: would not be the best lead if E had club void|pg||
nt|rodal f: If @H was played defence needed to play @S before a new @C for 1 down. Not easy|pg||

mb|p|nt|tokay1975: splinter yapildiktan sonra  bunu kontrlamak bence mucize |pg||
nt|tokay1975: cok zor|pg||
mb|2S|nt|davidb: 4 boards  to go -most of the swings -2 slams -normal   in a match between 2 good teams |pg||
nt|athene: perhaps 3@H is just too high in fact|pg||
nt|athene: redouble to play from south? :)|pg||
nt|athene: a modern idea is to use the redouble to show a different hand|pg||
nt|athene: you can either play that pass = 2 hearts only|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H = 3 hearts min|pg||
nt|athene: and xx = 3 hearts max|pg||
nt|athene: or you can play that 2@H = 3 hearts, positional|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 800 seyirciye ulaþtýk|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and xx = 3 hearts, prefers pd to play it|pg||
nt|athene: typically with something like @Dxxx|pg||
nt|athene: in case pd has a diamond tenace|pg||
nt|mariner1: REDBL must show a real NT and a fit|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mariner1: or a willingness to play @D I suppose|pg||
nt|athene: if north has a problem, the XX must be to play|pg||
nt|tomi2: 7@D on finding @DQ and this error and the match is close again|pg||
nt|kaapo: North has long support but no strength, shape, nor @C honours|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: could be a huge win for poland instead|pg||
mb|4S|nt|raghavan: If they do not cash Clubs - will make 12. May not lead from CA xxx|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S worked well in Open Room|pg||
nt|athene: if it showed 3 hearts, north wld bid 2@H like a shot|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: where is this going?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: or 4 @S much better|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: EW has a lucky 6D/6NT here.  But shouldn't be bid.|pg||
nt|kaapo: East is very maximum for his limited opening|pg||
nt|po-s: 4sp by Simon?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: the Swedes have nothing printed on the ceiling... the thinking is done by staring at the screen :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: 3 nt from W might have been better ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: i wonder if 2@c is GF @c or bal|pg||
nt|charles_l: it is a common treatment|pg||
nt|davidb: D  guess for the contract |pg||
nt|athene: i prefer to bid over 1NT with that west hand|pg||
nt|kaapo: I hope it's the sreen that divides that table and not your screen ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: lol, yes :)|pg||
nt|othered1: This is a not very lucky spot.  4@S on the west hand, however, is very pushy.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you can't go letting people play in 2@H when you have spades!|pg||
nt|mariner1: so Greece likely to pickup a dual part score swing here|pg||
nt|poohbear: severe comunication problems oin this hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: East isnt going anywhere|pg||
nt|eerbil: evet 4 daha|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 5@c after a short consultation of the system on the ceiling|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|syl: "You dont comment this bid???"-asks a kib|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I dont have time to comment|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nuclear war|pg||
pc|c5|nt|poohbear: If north leads a @h declarer will happily cash alot of tricks|pg||
nt|poohbear: on a @s lead declarer gets endplayed in hand|pg||
nt|othered1: no return looks attractive to north.  East likely hasn't guaranteed 5@S, so trump shift could be costly, too.|pg||
nt|othered1: as cards lie, @C is very effective|pg||
nt|othered1: And huge hitch may help east work out where things are.  Just won't be very helpful this time.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: LOl |pg||
nt|sybarra2: Bas are they playing with screens? |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Yes|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Both above and underneath the table surface|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: he might have bid 2@S over 2@H if east hadn't doubled|pg||
nt|athene: although of course he wouldn't have been in balancing seat|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s some relay?|pg||
nt|ritong: probably some puppet auction|pg||
nt|hedyg: Rusinow style lead, KQ@H, no J or 10|pg||
nt|ritong: mm...Q = please do not unblock, rather  means suit is not that solid|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|ritong: K would impose an unblock if available|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: h|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would like to thx all the specs for there nice inputs. Without ure help it would have been harder for us.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kaapo: After 1NT, I'd bet on 3NT|pg||

mb|1H|nt|ritong: do we perceive some revendicative tones?:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hah iþte sana göre bir deklare tokay :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: on 3 rd seat maybe they dont play in french style|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: finally a winning bet|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: 1@D is probably a transfer to @H|pg||
mb|1S|nt|babydolldk: but why not bid 4@H instead of 3 if you are not going to cue bid?|pg||
nt|poohbear: simple 3nt here|pg||

mb|p|nt|MolvaM: ortak pastan geliyor|pg||
nt|tomi2: here, in the other romm it was an artifical bid to show weak hands|pg||

mb|p|nt|MolvaM: ne diyeceksin buna?|pg||

mb|p|nt|babydolldk: well... next:) 4@S|pg||
nt|charles_l: perhaps 4@h shows another handttype|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2 over 1 response forcing - 3H is support N does not know about S hand yet. He only says game in H|pg||
nt|tokay1975: bu el x diyebilir  biraz risk alir|pg||

nt|hedyg: bonjour Alexandre|pg||
pc|h4|nt|babydolldk: yes, you are right, just wondering if s had a @C cue, would they still have played 4@H, how could n know it was rigt to bid 4@H....|pg||
nt|babydolldk: 'right|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: still thinking...|pg||
nt|raghavan: Can I surmise the bidding as = 1C strong 1D <8 points, 2D both Majors 2H says Spades S agrees on S Is it OK Charles, Anita?|pg||
nt|babydolldk: yes!|pg||
nt|le joker: bonjour tout le monde :)|pg||
nt|le joker: hi |pg||
nt|gracelin: 1H showed 3-card support, but strength unlimited.|pg||
nt|tomi2: don't know if they have some agreement on the double, it could be @D only or takeout on 1@H|pg||
nt|tomi2: west bid 1@S in case partner has support, he still had @Daxxx in bag in case he finds out partner has only dias and no spades|pg||
pc|h2|nt|tomi2: seems he still believes its takeout because he did not lead @D|pg||
nt|gracelin: I can see eleven tricks here so maybe another 1 imps to Norway.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer needs to test clubs early.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in 4@S -50  in Open Room here|pg||
nt|athene: @SAKQ @DA is a bit of a flaw in 4@S|pg||
nt|poohbear: merely overtricks involved|pg||
nt|ritong: no big sweat here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12 tops|pg||
nt|ritong: just has to play to the end just in case|pg||
nt|hedyg: no extras|pg||
nt|rodal f: THX to The Romanian Bridgefederation and BBO with all there nice helpers for bringing this event to us. Roland Wald at least by his nice woork.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|poohbear: best lead for the defense|pg||
nt|ritong: possible sqz|pg||
nt|ritong: although unlikely|pg||
pc|h8|nt|charles_l: i dont know their methods|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: writing down bidding explanations now|pg||
nt|raghavan: as if I know. I inly guess on seeing their bids|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes proved to be :)|pg||
nt|ritong: have to hit same defender with @s KQ and @h QJ|pg||
nt|kastan88: slam time, 6 clubs here: 4 top tricks in side suits give away 1 @H and then crossruff. But that is not easy to find|pg||
nt|pelu: perfect distribution for NS - but difficult to bid a slam on 25 HCP|pg||
pc|h6|nt|tokay1975: ama 3h  ozellikle belirtim (bnm icin) konu disi|pg||

nt|mariner1: 732&qroundno=3-   results after session|pg||
nt|tomi2: he will maybe follow Zatorskis line for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: if only he knew how small the diff. is...|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1 Imp is actually 1 VP, yes?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Keeping the @HA retains the control of the suit|pg||
nt|kaapo: So if this doesn't succeed, he can still have a shot at diamonds|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mug: the Open Room score doesn't appear in the movie, but England were one down in 4@S here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bordu egale etmeye çalýþmak çok güzel bir tanýmlama.  maçtan sonra ortaklarý susturmak için iþe yarar|pg||

pc|s7|nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=3|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes so if he makes an overtrick and other 2 boards are flat, then they score 15-15|pg||
nt|tomi2: if he makes 10 and other boards are flat, then it's 16-14 for poland|pg||
nt|gracelin: he is in trouble and need to drop CQ now to make|pg||
nt|tomi2: ha can also try to finesse, but that wd be more than one VP...|pg||

pc|s2|nt|ritong: jeeze|pg||

nt|rodal f: We where: Adrian - Silviu (Romania) and Geir - Frank (Norway) trying to do ower best as commentators. J26 are at a freeday tomorrow, but more nice bridge are to come from the Girls ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: many thanks to all the sponsors and organizers for helping BBO bring us the|pg||
nt|mariner1: vugraphs!|pg||
nt|gracelin: Norway can sacrifice in 5D here to tie the match, or to push opponents to 5S for a win.|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C isn't natural|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mariner1: and thanks for their wit and insight to my co-commentators William Frisby and Mike|pg||
nt|mariner1: Gold (Great Britain), and Roland Wald (Denmark).....I am Rob Brown (USA)........|pg||
nt|hedyg: i like the upgrade to 1NT|pg||
nt|tomi2: they play 4 card suits, yes?|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: and to Anita & Raghavan|pg||

nt|athene: a heart lead is nice, whoever declares|pg||

nt|MolvaM: milli takýmlarýmýza da baþarýlar|pg||

nt|poohbear: this should buy it|pg||
nt|eerbil: tebrikler gençlerimize|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: East downgrades somewhat - he has 11 HCP but it doesn't look good|pg||
nt|athene: he expects to need 9 fast tricks on a heart lead to make 3nt|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes its not a quality 11 at all|pg||
nt|MolvaM: önümüzdeki günlerde yapýlacak türkiye maçlarýnda gene birlikte olmak dileði ile|pg||
nt|ozgull: umarým bu maç milliler için çýkýþa geçme maçýdýr. Fena oynamadýlar baþarýlar diliyoruz|pg||
nt|kaapo: This time it is not so|pg||
nt|kaapo: The bidding might look Polish Club now|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@C could be a puppet to 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: Open Room result by the way was 1NT +3|pg||
nt|athene: and he has no aces and no long suit...|pg||
nt|tomi2: so Poland will win this 16-14.  Thx to both teams for this interesting set|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, tough to find the sacrifice after 4S.  Yes, I agree with specs' comments that both pairs performed very well at their age.  They might be the future of our game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: double denied 4 spades, i assume, so 2@S is just offering to play the Moysian|pg||
nt|le joker: thanks all ! see you in 3rd match :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ty all see U in an hour|pg||
nt|ritong: so, 44 imps gap|pg||
nt|tokay1975: tebrikler genclere|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps intending to show an invitational hand later|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Ty for help|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ozgull: 22 - 8 ile günü kapatmak  iyi moral tebrikler gençler|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: erm|pg||
nt|po-s: then 3D would  show his full hand (North´s)|pg||
nt|kaapo: If 2@C was a puppet to 2@D (including the option of passing 2@D), North's not bidding 2@D would show extra strength|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mug: imaginative 2@S bid from Bell, he has denied four of them, so 2@S shows three, maximum for his bidding, partner can work it out|pg||
nt|ritong: make that 36|pg||
nt|tomi2: next segment will be in 50 Minutes I rhink|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: taking the heart ruff in the short hand if partner has 4-3-3-3 or something like that|pg||
nt|po-s: I suggested 3D - would show extra AND his shape|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tomorrow 0900 Girls. Junior 21 start 1630. All CET|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mariner1: for fun I put E had into the K&R evaluator K&R (KT6 K3 KQ84 7652) = 10.65|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks, Shirley, Bas and specs.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mariner1: so E has an 11 worth less than face value|pg||
nt|fahir: tüm yorumculara teþekkürler, Brasov dan iyi akþamlar|pg||
nt|po-s: and would get a potential 3NT played by South|pg||
nt|kaapo: There might be trouble in 3@D if North hasn't shown real clubs yet|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps 1@S could be 18+ (or so) with 5+@S|pg||
nt|po-s: well, yes, who knows - do they have a convention card?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mariner1: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi   K&R|pg||

pc|s4|nt|mariner1: the good news here in N does not have a high @c pip|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kaapo: And there they are|pg||
nt|po-s: and North or South probably forgot what 2C was|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: massive consultations on both sides of the screen|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: in the OR N is in 3NT|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, yes, maybe they have to work on their CC a little bit more themselves, too|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and made +3|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ritong: i havent the VP scale under my eyes, presumably 21 or 22 VPs to frenchies|pg||

nt|athene: the defence can organize south a heart ruff but that doesn't help them enormously|pg||

nt|athene: pressure play from south!|pg||
nt|mug: but it may have cost him the contract|pg||
nt|athene: west doesn't want to lose to @CQ and then @C9 on the overruff and @CA@DA to come|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mug: don't think South would have played a trump from @CAxx|pg||

nt|rodal f: And then 9 are on|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mariner1: now he can lose 9@C in ruff too|pg||
nt|athene: if south really did have @CA9x and want a heart over-ruff, it would be more natural for him to try spades and diamonds to find partner's ace|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps lead a diamond simply to try to set up a diamond ruff for partner|pg||
nt|athene: so perhaps that small trump was suspicious - but not at all easy for declarer to be fair|pg||
