mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H can also include 5@H & 5@S|pg||
nt|lc: With strong @C, South can bid 4@H and put pressue on -- and hope no slam.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 4@H and any longer suit|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kit: nice when your canape opener hits partner's 6-bagger|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|kit: But West will surely accept the transfer, won't he?|pg||
nt|lc: This kept E-W out of 4@S.|pg||

nt|kit: not closed room auction -- South opened 2@H, 2@S overcall, and North took creepy-crawlie approach of 3@H (and then 4@h over 3@S)|pg||
nt|lc: Yeah, but if you try to Google Canape to look it up, you will get food info.,|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and popularized by Italian Blue Team in a couple of their systems|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2C|nt|kit: had he bid 4@H immediately, he would have gotten his plus score against 4@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: well, this is true negative double for minors|pg||
nt|chip: Lair wanted to emphasize spades for the lead.|pg||
nt|lc: :)|pg||
nt|lc: How many @S now by Berk?|pg||
nt|kit: but somehow bidding 2@D looks more to the point to me|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe 2@D is NF in their system?|pg||
nt|chip: maybe 2D - NF?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D is NF|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lc: Not easy to reach slam now.|pg||
nt|kit: this is a good illustration why negative free bids of a MINOR aren't a good idea|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|lc: No way Granovetter can raise this.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if NF   do you expect 2@D to end the auction with that monster?|pg||
nt|kit: This time he lucks out, as slam goes down on the stiff club lead -- but that is just luck IMO|pg||
nt|lc: Actually, a @C lead would beat slam.|pg||
nt|chip: We now see that Russ got pushed into 5D. Maybe figures other side will have a good save.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter explaining to Lair that 2@d immediately over 1@s would have been NF|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip: See, Lair did get his spade lead.|pg||

mb|p|nt|kastan88: double now is wrong without trump tricks and minimum, IMO, if this is not some artificial|pg||
nt|asig: Dbl is very ill advised as 2@h is unbeatable|pg||

nt|vasanti: looks like they not reaching game|pg||
nt|peachy: as the cards lay, Michielsen will make this, mebbe even four|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Cecilia (Cilla) Rimstedt is West, the younger of the two sisters|pg||
nt|peachy: she played with Emma yesterday, is that right?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I think she is 20, Sandra 22|pg||
nt|Walddk3: No, that is Sandra|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mtvesuvius: That cannot be a winning bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 1NT would show about 18 with me,  so Robert is expecting miracles I think|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Perhaps a little confusing, but  Sjöberg - Sandra Rimstedt  and  Grönkvist - Cecilia Rimstedt  are regular partnerships|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kastan88: what to think with South hand, if partner saying, I have lot of heart tricks? So probably double was something, or South knowing partner doubling sometimes without tricks :)|pg||
nt|vasanti: young blood wants to draw blood:)|pg||
nt|kastan88: even 3@H is good sacrifice, as 4@S stay and 3@H only 1 down|pg||
nt|vasanti: loke jaak says ill advised|pg||
nt|vasanti: like|pg||
nt|asig: Even 5@h is a good save :)|pg||
nt|vasanti: kx and 2 aces also guaranteed shortage in @H in ps hand 3sp was better now?|pg||
nt|kastan88: North putting partne under pressure: why she is doubling without trump tricks?|pg||
nt|vasanti: 3@D from s might still save their game|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: EW are already in 3@H :)|pg||
nt|asig: 3NT now to collect the vul game bonus?|pg||
nt|vasanti: u true:)|pg||
nt|asig: And a matchpoint top|pg||
nt|MolvaM: belki 3nt açýþýnda "yanda birþey yok" oynuyorlardýr?|pg||
nt|eerbil: 4.pozisyondan öyle oynamýyorlardýr herhalde|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu elikontrsuz oynuyor olmamýz gayet iyi|pg||
nt|eerbil: bi önceki boardda, koz ataðýndan sonra 4@s kolayca yapýlmýþ|pg||

nt|ahollan1: see ---  :(|pg||
nt|kit: 4-3-3-3 isn't an upgrade|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lc: But KJ10x in long suit and no jacks is good.|pg||
nt|kit: yes, that gets it back to 14|pg||
mb|d|mb|1H!|mb|4H|nt|lc: And FAV.|pg||
nt|chip: maybe more of an upgrade for the vulnerability.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 controls?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: payback to Lair for 1st hand of set ???|pg||
nt|chip: good to right side it with that normal lead.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: well, partner has a decent hand, and 2@S is far from cold on a different lead|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h8|nt|lc: I wasn't here, but on Bd. 46 (click movie), I think Ekeblad has easy 2NT over 2@D and didn't have to lose the swing.|pg||

nt|namial1: i think declarer did not loose A @d|pg||

mb|p|nt|tomi2: i think i'd want to be in 4@S on that hand after this bidding|pg||
nt|tomi2: and because i don't know how to finesse I would win ;)|pg||

nt|kastan88: this time North not so aggressive :)|pg||
nt|asig: Germany indeed bid 4S on 5|pg||
nt|vasanti: E hand is more like 4/5@C opening and iff ines chest|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mtvesuvius: disciplined pass by Gronkvist  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: 3@d isn't too bad actually, and certainly a good "save"|pg||
nt|vasanti: off ones forgive bad typing|pg||
nt|yuval10: E had 3 options - 3@h/ 2@h and pass|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 2NT game-forcing with 4+ hearts       4@D   5-5|pg||
nt|Walddk3: That will make Rimstedt stay away from the D lead one would assume|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Molenaar did not have that info in the other room and led @DK, but the contract went down regardless|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kastan88: now i think East can't stop  West to bid slam, or...|pg||
nt|vasanti: S s 2sp rather aggressive|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps some writing taking place|pg||

mb|5C|nt|mtvesuvius: hmm. Treating that as invitational just doesn't look right|pg||

nt|yo_yo: that means a "push" to you shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not an easy grand to bid do you think?|pg||

mb|p|nt|eerbil: çünkü AK treflin dýþarda olmasý neredeyse imkansýz irfan'ýn elinden|pg||
nt|ozgull: pass geçmeyecek olsa 4sp dermiydi|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was actually in other room with some of that discussion |pg||
nt|sybarra: need our wits about us on this 3 nt |pg||
nt|yuval10: he went for the only non-juniorish option :)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|asig: But also very effective, taking up valuable bidding space|pg||
nt|vasanti: sure finds p with good fit|pg||
nt|kastan88: occasionally not right red K in West hand|pg||
nt|eerbil: zaten 4sp demesi de normal deðil ki|pg||

mb|p|nt|namial1: a lot of down here|pg||

mb|p|nt|murat: karo ataðýna, tref dama doðru oynasa  6 olmuyor mu ? iki tur çekip durmasý yeterli|pg||
nt|sybarra: always smile and say "thanks p"  (esp. for the @H suit) |pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes it looks hopeless if you are of a pessimistic natuer|pg||
nt|namial1: i prefer 1 NT opening|pg||

nt|yuval10: declarer has a lot of work to do here....|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The Dutch a little lucky here because even 4@H rates to go down|pg||
nt|peachy: what would you lead from W?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Maybe a low heart although I can see that a spade is fine|pg||
pc|hA|nt|MolvaM: neyse. frenler tuttu |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|yo_yo: now for the @H switch|pg||

nt|yuval10: 2@c, 2@s and 2@d losers are visible|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: he needs to play trump from his hand|pg||
pc|h5|nt|laurentiu: not the good bid ... as at least 6 are on the table|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Adam and Arifin, you have a third commentator now|pg||
nt|peachy: The Dutch will be happy |pg||
nt|peachy: oops, they are in 5!|pg||

pc|hK|nt|mtvesuvius: great, Hi Peter :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yo_yo: now he feels OK|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h by E should show some @d preference|pg||
nt|yuval10: so W did very well to play @d rather than @s|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Peter all the way from Australia|pg||
nt|murat: diðer masa 4de durdu|pg||
nt|MolvaM: acaba batýnýn yan rengi trefl olabilir mi?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: o zaman trefl çakasý tehlikesi var|pg||
nt|MolvaM: dolayýsý ile trefl dönüþüne as girmek zorunda kalacak|pg||
pc|cT|nt|petergill: I think East liked his @DAJ 9 positioned over the 2@D bid, so East pushed towards a possible vulnerable game with the aggressive 3@H call.|pg||
nt|asig: Still one off|pg||
nt|vasanti: almost there but sadly dk wrong|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mtvesuvius: True, although I don't think it's strong enough anyway|pg||
nt|petergill: 9 tricks look possible if West continues to play it well|pg||

nt|ahalim: and if @H's were 3-2 even 10|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: true|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|yuval10: def. will have to open @s for declarer|pg||

nt|yuval10: so -1 it will be|pg||
pc|d3|nt|laurentiu: Diana and Lucian ... is a new pair ... starting to play togheter since the end of previous year|pg||
nt|petergill: then he should play the strong bidder North for the ace, not the queen, of clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: looks like it is 1 down. |pg||
pc|c5|nt|ovncylmz: -4?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: right, then it has overtricks when @hs split|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Berk: "I could have bid 3@c, I lose 2 spades, 2 hearts, 2 clubs ..." Lair: "I could have beaten it with a diamond out and a heart back"|pg||
nt|kit: two balanced hands, two distributional hands.  Let's see who bids the most.|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe E-W "save" is a make?  Lots of handling in 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: We're still waiting for Russ to get back from his smoke break - now he's here|pg||
nt|lc: 1@S  2@H  2@S,  then South drives to 4@H and E-W ...  we'll see.|pg||
nt|kit: West hand is good example of:  When you are void in their suit, bid one more than you think you should.|pg||
nt|lc: Also, when in doubt bid 4@S over 4@H|pg||
nt|lc: Although 4@H is down, so ...|pg||
nt|kit: and when you have spades, there is never doubt :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: So, 3@H blows E-W out.  Must be intermediate.|pg||

nt|lc: Not now, anyway.|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|kit: East very luck that the lead didn't cost a trick.  Just because partner bid the suit, doesn't mean he has the king.|pg||
nt|lc: You wouldn't lead a spade, Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: well, I would lead a spade before I would lead a heart|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ: "you play upside down?" Berk: "we play first discard is odd/even"|pg||
nt|kit: so I guess that makes it my third choice|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: I like my aces to capture their honors|pg||
nt|lc: I'd lead a @S before I'd guess a minor and watch declarer throw @S and have partner look at me with his @SKQJ10x and ask why I didn't lead one.|pg||

nt|peachy: auction same as open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|liviu123: 2@S by W in open Room|pg||
nt|eerbil: içerde rua karo ataðýndan sonra oynayan piki verdi, sonuç olarak geçtiðimiz el de egale gitti|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Nielsen hasnt a bid |pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: reasonably:)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|MolvaM: 3@h mü kontr mu? yoksa ne?|pg||
nt|eerbil: EW 3@s yapýyor, NS 3@h'ü ise trefl ataðýna 1 batýyor|pg||
nt|hobakan: 3 Trefl|pg||
nt|pelepele: 3nt maybe ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not an easy bid for S,  |pg||
nt|gulyas: The x probably shows @H, as a xfer sequence|pg||
nt|gulyas: my guess:)|pg||
nt|othered1: might double have specifically shown @H?|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe so |pg||
nt|Walddk3: and the obvious 4 losers|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|ahalim: now slam time|pg||
nt|aupillon: looking at @d position, Nt is MUCH better|pg||
nt|aupillon: look upon the club problem for 3NT now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but he decided he had extras|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt I would find the 2 @S call |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: hmm|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yet another slam for NS|pg||
nt|yo_yo: nor me  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: lets see if his play justifies his bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: E finding it interesting that his pard has the A |pg||
nt|gulyas: anyway, they stayed away from the @H contract, a good start:)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ovncylmz: junior bridge rulez|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: do you agree?|pg||
nt|eerdvegas: strange, just a normal game here|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 24hcp?|pg||
nt|eerdvegas: well I think all national squads would bid here the game|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|petergill: 3NT might dampen North's slam ambitions|pg||
nt|ahalim: and an easy one to play|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@c = cue - 1st or 2nd round control|pg||
nt|ahalim: you simply cannot misquess @D's :)|pg||
nt|ahalim: sry misguess|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT = non-serious about slam, hence 4@S cue later, since 3NT had already said that his hand was poor, so 4@C was a most serious slam try indeed|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S = 1st or 2nd round spade control, denies 1st or 2nd round @D control due to bypassing 4@D, hence North needs to think now, knowing no @Da opposite|pg||
nt|hobakan: :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: but 4@s will be interesting|pg||
nt|yuval10: and here it comes|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: The leaders at the moment are 1. Norway with 101 VPs 2. Germany with 95 VPs 3. France with 91 VPs|pg||
nt|petergill: North decides slam is a finesse and trump break at best, i.e. less than the required 50% |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Tarnovski now wants to sign off|pg||
nt|aupillon: 3NT would have been best as 3rd South bidding|pg||
nt|othered1: Wonder why east didn't lead partner's suit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: even it was not a transfer sequence, (just a plain neg. X)   not sure what I would bid with S |pg||
nt|gulyas: good Q, he knew that pd had a singleton|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|s2|nt|MolvaM: 4 as dýþarýda iken zor|pg||

nt|aupillon: but O/W have to take tricks QUICK|pg||
nt|aupillon: E/W*|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would rather bid my AKx than my xxx:)|pg||
nt|mug: North appreciated his golden cards in partner's suits|pg||
nt|yuval10: small @h now... and declarer will play A@h and another one|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|tomi2: in OR both players downgraded their hands|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I can't believe thety are still playing the hand|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Did everyone fall asleep, Florin?|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: seems it was a revoke on clubs, director at table|pg||
nt|peachy: either that or everyone went for a Coke|pg||
mc|10|nt|bily: thx all go to work bye|pg||
nt|tomi2: west opened 1@S that could be light in a strong club system and E only invited|pg||
nt|ahalim: wow|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: wow, well done|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Padon liked his club control and spots I bet|pg||
nt|petergill: Superficially, South might have passed 5@H, as the partnership might be off @DAK from South's point of view, but he takes the view that his hand could not be better and with no @DA ...|pg||
nt|petergill: nor @DK North would have bid 4@H not 4@C|pg||
nt|ahalim: albeit a little bit undisciplined :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: U26 :)|pg||
nt|othered1: good duck, limiting the loss|pg||

nt|ahollan1: how about if swap @SK with @Cx|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe then.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ: "I had sort of an intermediate jump overcall; I liked the lead; it was on the heart finesse; or a club onside"|pg||
nt|chip: I agree, decent defense and lots of losers.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 10-15 HCP, (a) 6+@C, 1-suit  (b) 4+@C and 5+@S|pg||
nt|chip: makes 4H unattractive.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|3H|nt|lc: Important to know now if X=@D or a good hand. Hope they discussed it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: 4@h with a chance to make in the closed room on 52 ( no @c shift)|pg||
nt|kit: now how does South know whether to choose clubs or spades on his hand?|pg||
nt|lc: West has both cases covered.|pg||
nt|chip: At least he has both.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlike Precision   this 2@D bid does NOT show any values|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Lair sort of alerted the DBL, but no questions|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Pass denies 5+@S hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: another good example of partnership agreements -- you have to have a general rule on doubles of artificial calls like this, and stick to it|pg||
nt|chip: Ours is it shows the suit, right?|pg||
nt|lc: We play it shows @D.|pg||
nt|kit: yep|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: And now another double, this one takeout|pg||
nt|chip: Showing the suit is my default with Lew also.|pg||
nt|lc: What will Berk do if Lair doubles again?|pg||
nt|kit: And if East passes it, they just might take him out|pg||
nt|kit: well, 5 tricks are easier than 9, so .......|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Lair asks about 2@d. Granovetter won't write because it's now after sundown, so they get up and go away from the table and he explains, not quite loudly enough for me to hear|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: effectively  all hands without significant @C support  bid 2@D|pg||
nt|lc: Pass would get 500, it seems.|pg||
nt|kit: now that seems wrong -- means the other side knows that a bid is alerted and asked about|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ asks Berk if they have an agreement about the DBL of 2@d and he says not clear|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|lc: Easier to pass 3@C in a bidding contest than at the table where -670 is painful.|pg||
nt|kit: East's decision a big swing there|pg||
nt|lc: At least that's my defense of my partner.|pg||
nt|kit: simple LAW pass, right Larry?|pg||
nt|lc: You guys can all pile on and say that PASS was easy.  Yeah.|pg||
nt|chip: not a good hand for the NS system. No way for S to avoid playing a silly contract (way too high in 3C, but if he passes 2c, could be a 4-2 with a 5-3 spade fit).|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|kit: You gotta believe!|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lc: Esspecially if partner has @D, pass makes sense.  But David's (and my) philosophy is try not to be -670 and win the match on some other board.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: figure  2 opponents guessing but only 1 partner|pg||

nt|chip: The 2C opening could have had 5S and 4 clubs (not a normal precision 2C).|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wish i'd used Kit's philosophy with stock market|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, but -670 not as good as + 140.|pg||
nt|kit: 2 of clubs a very bad idea here|pg||
nt|kit: if it occurs to declarer to stick in the 7, that extra trick might be the difference here.|pg||
nt|kit: playing the 7 of clubs is saying that Ekeblad made a bad play|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|d8|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|c6|nt|kit: declarer probably okay anyway, as he is in overruffing position in both minors|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|kit: but maybe not -- that 2 of spades might be too small to compete with South's spades|pg||
nt|poohbear: Grovesnor is a play where the opponent purposely gives you a winning option when he ddint have to. Strictly to mess with your head|pg||
nt|kit: certainly South needs to ruff -- can't let that 2 of spades score|pg||
nt|poohbear: I am may have the spelling wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter seems to have the little diamond ready to play|pg||
nt|poohbear: Grosvenor I am told|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: But he's still thinking about it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't believe it until you see it |pg||

nt|petergill: A superb effort by the young Israelis to double up 3@H at the other table with 3-2 holding in trumps|pg||
nt|petergill: An ambitious 4@S seems to have four losers|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I am told that EW are disputing the 6@H bid, saying there was a long delay before bidding 5@h|pg||
nt|ahalim: indeed and with a known fit in @S's too|pg||

nt|othered1: quite a nice result for NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: all things considered a good + score for n/s|pg||
nt|Walddk3: One of the defenders revoked when a club was played to the ace|pg||
nt|Walddk3: and a 1 trick penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|ovncylmz: muidberg?|pg||
nt|eerdvegas: yes|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 5M 4+m?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Contract made|pg||
nt|peachy: at least it is a non-controversial ruling, mechanical 1 trick awarded|pg||
mb|1D|nt|cascade: it is hard to imagine not getting to game|pg||
nt|othered1: do you act initially with west's hand?  |pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, with so many @Ds available for EW|pg||
mb|1H|nt|laurentiu: 6 cl on EW|pg||
nt|asig: 3@s asking for a spade stopper|pg||
nt|aupillon: here 4@s seem clearcut to me|pg||

mb|d|mb|1N|nt|eerdvegas: 4@S good save here , nobody will enter the bidding now I think|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: one italian and one norwegian pairs made 4@s|pg||
nt|petergill: Are screen in use?|pg||
nt|asig: Perfect hand for that gadget|pg||
nt|asig: Apparently W not playing this convention|pg||
nt|kastan88: West cant pass, only if South doubled|pg||
nt|aupillon: x|pg||
nt|aupillon: 2 @s only. Only 15 and 3 @h losers|pg||
nt|cascade: I prefer to bid my suits on this sort of hand but 2@c would be a common action|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, it is best to preempt, despite the 4c @H suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: took the pot with that preempt |pg||
nt|othered1: That's the modern approach, but I can't bring myself to do it.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am with you Ed,  had been drummed into me too long I am afraid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: I think so|pg||
nt|kastan88: oh, no|pg||
nt|asig: NS can make 4@S and can only get 300 against 3@s undoubled - so a possible gain for Germany|pg||
mb|2H|nt|aupillon: sometimes it can be bad|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what now shirley?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: but 5@C on EW stay|pg||

mb|p|nt|eerbil: eller uyutmaya yönelik geliyor, nerede bi önceki maçta gelen 8'li, 10'lu renkler :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|vipe1: hello everyone :).|pg||
nt|vipe1: interesting bidding so far.|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW missed 4@s here, but obviously it's not easy to get there|pg||
nt|yuval10: after 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@c overcall would've made it a lot easier|pg||
nt|yuval10: if EW doesn't decide to sit for it with X , that is|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Rimstedt could give it a try, but it's not attractive at all from her hand|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps West underbid|pg||
nt|mug: suppose she had visions of @SAQ10 on her left|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petergill: If so, 15 seconds is not considered to be a hesitation - also, with screens, the hesitation exists only if it is pointed out by the opponent on the side of the screen that did not ...|pg||
nt|petergill: hesitate, by EBL (Euro) and WBF regulation. |pg||
nt|petergill: So my guess is that the 6@H score will stand  - just guessing, as a commentator is entitled to do.|pg||
nt|petergill: I can confirm that screens are in use|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|othered1: agree|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|petergill: If the hesitation was over 20 (or is it 25 or 30, I cannot remember) seconds, as it may have been, it is considered to be a valid hesitation with screens in use.|pg||
nt|gulyas: I guess he will lose 1@H and 2@S more, for just making|pg||

pc|hT|pg||
nt|ahalim: 20 sec's it is|pg||
nt|petergill: EW have stopped sensibly in 3@S - the dynamic action on this hand was at the other table. |pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Arifin|pg||
nt|vipe1: tried to steal a trick there, didn't work, extra one down if they play hearts and shorten her trump holding in hand|pg||
nt|vipe1: needs to play low heart from AK |pg||
pc|d4|nt|ovncylmz: denmark is back to tables|pg||
nt|petergill: I think declarer is hoping the defence opens up trumps or @D's for him, to resolve his guesses in those suits.|pg||
nt|cascade: I am not sure when Canonne thought that Robert had shown values|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|MolvaM: muhammet e aferin|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vipe1: instead of west having more trumps than declarer, now declarer has more than west meaning she'll give just one more trump trick and enjoy the spades|pg||

nt|lc: Berk will surely lead a @H.|pg||
nt|chip: yes, seems impossible on this auction.|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|chip: plus he has the majority of his side's strength.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lc: The funny thing is that the SOUTH side (with guarded @DK) is actually the best side to play 3NT from -- but would be the unlucky side here.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would Zia lead @DQ?|pg||
nt|poohbear: no|pg||
nt|chip: No|pg||
nt|lc: Only if he had hand records.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- that was meant to be rhetorical |pg||

nt|poohbear: and even then:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ: "4th normally?" "yes, second from bad"|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|kit: a very good case could have been made for going up queen of hearts there|pg||
nt|chip: maybe lead D if looking for a swing.|pg||
nt|kit: declarer's problem here is that if he knocks out the heart East will have diamond shift -- that is why I thought queen of hearts at trick 1 might be right, odd though it looks|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ went to the bathroom, promising to think while there, now back|pg||

nt|wwalter: @d, but how many? :)|pg||

nt|cascade: I like almost always to bid my six-card suit with this much strength|pg||
nt|Walddk4: For new viewers: Poland need to win by at least 13 IMPs to overtake France and win the gold medal|pg||
nt|wwalter: & needs 8 VP 4 the second place|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 13-16 imps is a split tie but Poland wins gold|pg||

nt|petergill: (1) they are not afraid to penalise you (2) they will take their tricks on defence and (3) your interference might help them figure out the layout if they become declarer|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yeah, although I probably should change that :)|pg||

nt|petergill: Adam, are you gong to play in the Washington DC Nationals later this month? |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk3: He will now|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Not the best timing by the defence|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|chip: But then we have to wait till after the hand (usually).|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter didn't realize he was dealer - they explain that no problems just didn't know who was dealer|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2N|mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|lc: East hand is actually easier to bid in Standard than in big @C.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: most players would play this 3@H bid is looking for a heart stopper, as it is.|pg||
nt|lc: This time, North had better lead his partner's suit to have any chance to beat 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Declarer will then have to guess @S.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lc: Is there any reason we can see that Lair will guess @SQ?  I don't think he will.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: well, this time heart lead is pretty easy|pg||
nt|kit: or so I thought|pg||
nt|lc: Strange leade, but will survive.|pg||
nt|chip: A bit different to lead partner's non-space consuming overcall (where the goal is to direct a lead).|pg||
nt|kit: but can survive|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|c2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kit: so it comes down to spade guess -- he knows South has longer hearts, so will play king of spades first.  And then ......|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: now Granovetter known to be on minimum overcall - especially for him -- maybe infer singleton @S?|pg||
nt|lc: Would Granovetter overcall with @HKJxxx  @CA and a flat hand VUL?|pg||
nt|lc: I sure would (the way my partner's lead).|pg||
nt|lc: But Granovetter is indeed sound.|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe for that reason, Ekeblad should not have revealed the @CJ here.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Lair checked the clock - we have plenty of time, so he's taking a restroom break and Russ is smoking. Back soon|pg||
nt|lc: Is BBO available in the restroom?|pg||
nt|lc: :)|pg||
nt|lc: Players are not allowed to have any electronic decives, by the way.|pg||
nt|lc: A good rule in today's electronic age.|pg||
nt|chip: maybe if you have an iphone or equivalent (why security on those is tight)|pg||
nt|lc: They actually don't screen or check.  It is on the "honor system."|pg||
nt|chip: But harsh penalties if caught.|pg||
nt|lc: Players wouldn't intentionally have a device, but they often forget to unload them and accidentally walk in with one in pocket.|pg||
nt|lc: Several times, cell phones have gone off and caused big problems.|pg||
nt|lc: Not at this event, as far as I know.|pg||
nt|poohbear: somebody mentioned a cell phone going off|pg||
nt|poohbear: forget who|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can Lair afford to win, and play some @D to get better inferential count?|pg||
nt|kit: not too safely|pg||
nt|lc: I don't think so, since North could ruff a @D|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe opponents would give honest count in @D.  :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lc: Maybe.|pg||
nt|kit: and he still won't know about the clubs -- that jack of clubs doesn't have to be remotely honest|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|s9|nt|lc: As North, you don't like to see that @SK.|pg||
nt|kit: and here we are ladies and gentlemen|pg||
nt|poohbear: Jack of @cs sure looked like someone who wanted to tap dummy|pg||
nt|kit: jack of clubs meaningless -- unless somebody has 4 spades, dummy tap is meaningless|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Schwartz in similar position but  2 rounds of hearts, Passell overtakes cashes @CA and exits @D|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does @C5 lead then @CJ help decide if they're  34 vs 43 ??|pg||

nt|Walddk4: However, 11 boards to go, a lot can happen|pg||
nt|z_lasu: maybe first imps to Romania at board 9|pg||

nt|aupillon: Can i go reach for a light to search ? Yes, driver said. Meanwhile he went away ( the driver). There was no 50£ bill. So the taxi was for free :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|liviu123: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=4&qshowflag=1    for running scores|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: xfers also works|pg||
nt|ahalim: everybody knows Adan :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|laurentiu: easy 3 nt or 4 spade|pg||
nt|po-s: now 3D and North will get excited|pg||
nt|eggy: some might shade East as 1NT, but not the French usually, who are very disciplined as a rule|pg||
nt|peachy: 2level the max either side can make, looks like|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahalim: sry Adam|pg||
nt|petergill: 9 straight plus scores by NS with 1100 just then - I think EW might feel a bit down at the moment. :(|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I'll bet|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's looks like a support X from east|pg||
nt|eggy: and 2NT a values raise|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and slam aspirations from robert?|pg||
nt|eggy: probably facing a weak NT, so will need perfect cards|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kastan88: misunderstanding seems previous brd again, 5@D without double, seems E made forcing pass, but West didn't play again that convention|pg||
nt|MolvaM: saðolsunlar :)|pg||
nt|murat: bu arada içerdeki masada rakipler çok agresif deklere veriyorlar.. bizimkiler bi yakalasa...|pg||
mb|p|nt|laurentiu: but 4sp is quiet difficult on heart lead|pg||
nt|laurentiu: and imp for Romania !!! :)|pg||
nt|laurentiu: I keep my hope alive! :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes but NS biidng his void|pg||
nt|eggy: I am told that by S 2 spades is 3 card support and 10+|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@h = @s's|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Mark Horton|pg||
nt|vipe1: about half of the tables made 4@s, half of them went down. 4@s-1 in open room is a good result for russia so far.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: When you feel down, it is hard to avoid giving back more imps. |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H is a sound contract, should make it and go plus, we hope|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@H is a nice spot, maybe an overtrick with the @h position|pg||
nt|petergill: I approve of both Wests deciding not to make a bold vulnerable 2@H overcall of 1@S. |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Craciun tells me that the Director has adjusted board 7|pg||
nt|aupillon: Have a nice day all, see you soon. Tks Charles and be right back tomorrow. Thanks all specs. Merci|pg||
nt|eggy: so this is a 4 card raise with 10+|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Robert has to pass, no interest by East|pg||
nt|eggy: Not sure that after 5@H this i even a think|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Glorious sunshine in Bath|pg||
nt|z_lasu: 3NT could be made here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mtvesuvius: to 5@h +1|pg||
nt|po-s: wrong|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eggy: after all East is limited to 3 cards in hearts, so setting up the diamond suit may not even be that straightforward|pg||
nt|cascade: hmmm cold and frosty here|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 1@s shows 3?|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes|pg||
pc|h5|nt|petergill: In the other match on BBO, Owen for England and Ozturk both overcalled 2@H over 1@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah well Neilsen might lead A@S|pg||
nt|vipe1: i guess 2@c is gazzili, either weak hand with 5@h4@c or a strong hand|pg||
nt|othered1: 25 HCP, no major fit = 3N.  May make, too.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: ok, and this should make exactly|pg||

nt|wwalter: 11 Imps , back 4 france|pg||
pc|c5|nt|MolvaM: normalde batmasý gereken bir kontrat bu|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a lead directing double |pg||
nt|Walddk4: and back in the lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: might just hand it |pg||
pc|c3|nt|mtvesuvius: oh, @c ruff for -1|pg||
pc|c9|nt|eggy: As Julien Clement says - 4S was possibly exclusion ..|pg||
nt|eggy: so a spade lead would not be sensible|pg||
nt|eggy: and S has told N to lead something alse anyway|pg||
nt|vipe1: this now shows strong hand with 3@s, nekrasova simply raises to 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @D, 3 @C, (maybe) 1 in each major |pg||
nt|gulyas: if he tries to play it safe by finessing @Ds into the S hand to avoid the @S thru, he may go down|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|petergill: entries to dummy for @H finesses and to run diamonds are scarce, if @DA is ducked on the first round of @Ds|pg||
nt|petergill: Clubs get overruffed|pg||
nt|hobakan: 10 lu kör þanssýz bizim için:(|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well done the Danes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: go on, who is J C?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Overall in  the event that is|pg||
nt|namial1: oups|pg||
nt|cascade: it might be more - I am told that 2@H actually made in the other room and it has been misscored|pg||
nt|chessmaste: But it had to be at trick one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Netherlands hot favourites to win the bronze medal, but Denmark has an outside chance|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hobakan: körler kamufle oldu sistemden dolayý|pg||
pc|s8|nt|othered1: Not sure an early @D play is right, unless needed for entries|pg||
pc|s7|nt|eggy: Although his hand is very tempting, I think that West took control too early really|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if it was exclusion then Lhussier didnt know either|pg||
nt|eggy: well the club is not going to run, so probably a trump is best technically now|pg||
nt|eggy: that's true Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you were right steve, the Danes gained on the last board|pg||
nt|eggy: yep - fearless intervention in the sandwich position|pg||
nt|z_lasu: but not that way|pg||

nt|lc: Some famous experts of yesteryear were great at reading the people (Poker-type skills) to "always" sniff out these queens.|pg||
nt|lc: Actually, Schwartz (at other table) claims to be very good at this aspect.|pg||
nt|lc: He has a good nose for these things and picking up "tells."|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ mumbling about trying to show him the J of clubs|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: of course  North on other side of screen from declarer|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lc: But, South can have a "tell" too.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|lc: Schwartz recently guessed a queen against DB-and-me -- claiming he could "tell."|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Berk: "not too many, please" before he goes off to rest|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hold your cards back Larry|pg||

nt|eggy: N is wishing he'd kept his outh shut now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT is, in theory, 15-17, but ....|pg||
pc|h6|nt|asig: good stop by EW here|pg||
nt|othered1: Not unusual for quantitative bidding to come a cropper here.  If north had gotten the long suit into the auction, south would have been very interested|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Rimstedt had her bid and will be disappointed that this is not making|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gulyas: but if S has a minimum, N should have bid slam already|pg||
nt|gulyas: agree, he should have brought @Cs to the picture|pg||
nt|gulyas: into I mean|pg||
nt|othered1: Do we know what range south showed here?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not how to bring the clubs in do you guys have suggestions?|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd consider south's hand 22+, and I'm not a habitual upgrader|pg||
nt|othered1: Hand is good enough for four NT, so transfer to @C, if available, then 4N.|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would say it is a very pretty 22|pg||
nt|gulyas: if his bidding shows 22+, N should have bid slam with his good 10|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N openings (directly or via 2@C) require very precise methods/agreements to unwind hands like this.|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe 3 @C over 2 @C?|pg||
nt|othered1: They do hog quite a bit of room and today's style doesn't require perfect shape, so . . . |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|s4|nt|eggy: and so ends up taking a losing action|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|chip: points out that a club lead would beat 4H (can't get pitch in time).|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: wow -- 3 to play, 4 to score   2 imp match|pg||

mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: 3@C game forcing raise|pg||
nt|kit: this should be a pretty easy slam to bid -- both strength and fit are there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks - i'm told it was P. Hal Sims|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|lc: I suspect 3@D is a minimum and 3@H asks again.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|lc: Prob 3@S means "Shortness somewhere"|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe I'm making this up, but it sounds good.  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there were a couple of pairs in this event using  1M-2N as old fashioned balanced game force|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Berkowitz has written very neat, VERY TINY notes about this auction - even with my brand new glasses there is no chance I can read them, sorry|pg||
nt|chip: or perhaps a stiff club (low stiff?)|pg||
nt|lc: If it shows any short, presumably 3NT now by Lair to ask where.|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|lc: Jan, did you use "neat" and "Berkowitz" in the same sentence?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|Vugraphu1: Yes and "tiny"|pg||
nt|lc: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|chip: note that while slam is virtually laydownhere, if E were 6-3-3-1 it would be quite poor.|pg||
mb|p|mb|7H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Indeed.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even with computer -- my notes aren't neat|pg||
nt|chip: So W was a bit lucky to find partner with the right hand.|pg||
nt|lc: So, 3@S did show specifically @C shortness.  I guess Lair wasn't worried about being off @HAK.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Berk says that 3@d showed a minimum and 3@h asked and 3@s showed club shortness. Lair thought that 3@s showed balance with a little extra|pg||
nt|lc: Also, when no X of Artif 3@H, a @H lead is less likely.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: And now that I have looked at Berk's notes, I will admit that "neat" might have been a slight overbid, but 'tiny' wasn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: You told us "VERY NEAT" -- I have it in writing.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Lair: "good luck" Berk: "this will not require luck, it will require not making 7, which I'd rather not"|pg||

nt|z_lasu: Romanian pair playing 3nt at board 9|pg||
nt|z_lasu: only one pair have won it already, but unfortunately they partners played 3d X -7 :)|pg||
nt|mug: you'd think over the double East would have sufficient opportunity to express pessimism that West wouldn't have to reraise|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: depends if pass or 2@s is stronger over the double though|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, E has XX, 2@h , P available|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: but I agree with a 4333 minimum that east has a pass|pg||
nt|mug: so perhaps 2@H should be natural, pass should be so-so, and 2@S should be garbage|pg||
nt|mug: I've never discussed the meaning of redouble|pg||
mb|4D|nt|eggy: N will need to duck the club smothly to have  chance|pg||

mb|p|nt|namial1: Difficult lead|pg||
nt|chris3108: goooooooooo france :) |pg||
nt|chessmaste: Still, declarer is still a trick short|pg||

nt|chris3108: euh sorry :) |pg||
nt|cascade: and they need to do that now|pg||
nt|wwalter: now needs to play 1s|pg||
nt|chessmaste: But I think North must now play spades |pg||
nt|cascade: she may think a diamond is safe|pg||
nt|chessmaste: She has a count in the diamond suit|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ovncylmz: back*|pg||
nt|eggy: well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: that won;t help the defence though|pg||
mb|5H|nt|othered1: All one or two spec who may have read Precision Power Bidding (not about Precision @C  system, which was developed much later) have heard about the Theory of Bounded Values, which ...|pg||
nt|othered1: applies here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: 3NT could be "serious". I don't know the E-W methods|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Maybe PO Sundelin does|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: 4@D was blackwood for @D and 5@C was 2 keycards and @DQ|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: what about israel performance?|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: denmark and israel are not good if you think their original level|pg||
nt|eggy: although he may try a ruffing finesse in clubs|pg||
nt|cascade: now attitude in spades|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Well done indeed!|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: well done|pg||
nt|Walddk3: They are very ambitious at the other table I am told. Verbeek-Molenaard are in 7@H!|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Molenaar|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|petergill: Natural bidding up to and including 4@C, 3@D suggesting 1435 shape, I think|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This should be a push|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: With no way to set @s up, and @h overruffs|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@d and 4@S look like cue-bids, with clubs agreed. |pg||
nt|po-s: don´t think they play serious. 2spades showed heart acceptance I think (if they play my NT methods)|pg||
nt|po-s: 3NT I believe would have denied shortness|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: South's final choice of 6@C is a bit exuberant, but would be fine if dummy had @CJ or @DQ. |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: or Q@S|pg||
nt|petergill: 12 tricks if only he could get to dummy to enjoy the spade tricks - somehow. But he cannot|pg||
nt|ahalim: still too optimistic|pg||
nt|wwalter: nice|pg||
nt|namial1: good switch|pg||
nt|cascade: so more IMPs to Poland|pg||
nt|vipe1: didn't let her gues how to play it, A@s AK@h A@d and five clubs.|pg||
nt|vipe1: *guess|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tomi2: they have played 3 of 23 matches...|pg||

nt|vipe1: she hid the longest suit :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|petergill: Ah, the optimism of youth :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|po-s: I think West should have bid slam with 3 and not 0 aces|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hobakan: valla +1 bize uyar|pg||
nt|z_lasu: +2 looks too much|pg||
nt|z_lasu: something must go wrong in defence|pg||

nt|hobakan: undo|pg||

nt|MolvaM: herhalde|pg||
nt|eerbil: niye? +1 yapsak fena mý olur|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Yes, I think 5@H was meant as "pass with 0, bid on with 3 keycards"|pg||

mc|11|nt|petergill: I'm off to bed - it's been fun commentating. Goodnight Adam and Arifin.|pg||

pc|s6|nt|kit: Will be down at least 2 it seems -- possibly 3|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|lc: All of Lair's @H plays trying to show lowest side suit (S.P.)|pg||
nt|lc: A big difference in the "expert" game is the constant use of subtle S.P. cards on defense.|pg||
nt|lc: Of course, your partner has to be watching.|pg||
nt|chip: Though some are more worried about helping declarer.|pg||
nt|lc: I remember the late great Bobby Goldman once told me that he is an excellent signaller but not as good a receiver.,|pg||
nt|lc: My philosophy is to always try to help partner, who is likely to need it more.  If declarer benefits, so be it.|pg||
nt|lc: I know my partner (if David) is watching. Never sure if declarer is.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: board 57 about to be pushed at 6@S|pg||
nt|mittmouse: to get out for 2 down he has to win the h and play a h back|pg||
nt|chip: A good declarer usually is watching.|pg||
nt|lc: I know you;d be watching, Chip :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Lisa Berkowitz had been turning the dummy for Russ, he just came back and as he sat down, he started to pick up her Sudoku book, but she took it - maybe he doesn't have enough to ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: occupy himself with remembering their system :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ couldn't stand it, got up to go out for another puff and Lisa's back turning the dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: identical auction in other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: If a card is ever called that is|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2NT in the closed room|pg||
nt|lc: It takes mental discipline to fight hard as declarer when you know it is a matter of -200 or -300.  But, in a close match, this is so importnat now.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Vugraphu1: Sorry, he had the A out but put it back|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lc: Also, there is a (bad) tendancy (habit) in a close, tense, important match such as this, to play quickly on the last board or two to run out and find out the result.|pg||

mb|3H|nt|eerbil: þanslý bir þlem eli geldi bizimkilere, önceki deneyime göre deme ihtimalimiz yüksek, iyi bir þlem olmasa da|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@C is almost always 12-14 balanced in Polish Club|pg||
nt|chessmaste: How about a spade lead here?|pg||
nt|mug: but not likely to be bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ovncylmz: hmm |pg||

nt|cascade: not so easy to find when you have four cards in an unbid suit|pg||

mb|3S|nt|eggy: as long as they switch to a club the defence should prevail|pg||
nt|eggy: er - or lead one :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: 2NT could be either or - support or a long heart with stiff spade|pg||

mb|p|nt|eggy: playing with fire now|pg||
nt|mug: Gronkvist might have tried 3@C but still hard for West to move|pg||
mb|4N|nt|laurentiu: they missed the small slem|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: of course 5@D needs diamond play|pg||

nt|chip: maybe 3C is puppet stayman, 3D no 5 card major?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lc: 3@D  =  no 5, but at least 1 4.|pg||
nt|lc: 4@H or 4@S|pg||

nt|othered1: At matchpoints there's a case for bidding 2@C on the south hand, with a hep (and tolerant) partner|pg||

nt|sybarra: the @H is almost like a 4 @C suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: *like a 4 card suit |pg||
nt|othered1: Playing with my preferred partners, 2@S is an ASTRO cue, showing 4@H and 6@C.  I might try that here due to relative suit qualilty|pg||

nt|othered1: I wonder how wide a range west's bid showed on last hand.  We're getting lots of anti-Michaels hands here.|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: of course no way to come close though|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps W had some other view about it...|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: running scores on http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/VGRama/minirama.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|laurentiu: not to overtake with the king of diamonds|pg||
nt|yuval10: can't see why didn't she bid 4@d then|pg||
nt|mug: might have worked better for South to start with 2@C over 1@S|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|mug: obviously was some kind of mechanical error or misunderstanding last hand|pg||
nt|Walddk3: This may roll in. Declarer is a hot favourites to get both black suits right after the pre-empt|pg||
nt|Walddk3: This solved one problem|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 4@D opening nexxt door kept everyone out|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Perhaps 4@D would have had a different meaning for this N-S pair|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Some play it as Namyats, a strong 4@S opening|pg||
pc|cA|nt|eggy: The problem with this hand is finding the strain to play in|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: 3swing for Romania on board 1|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: board 13'|pg||
pc|c2|nt|eerbil: yine gereksiz bi agresiflikle zona geldik|pg||
nt|MolvaM: cevapçýda 7 puan var. davete pas geçmek için kaç olmasý gerek?  6?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: "ortak 1 nt cevabýn yalan deðilse 3 de" konvansiyonu bu herhalde|pg||
nt|fahir: tekrar merhabalar, net bir süreliðine gitti baðlanamadýk|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hoþgeldiniz fahir bey :)|pg||
nt|ozgull: bir de üstüne diðer minör kýsa oynuyorlar bence|pg||
nt|relrikas: @C donusu olmamasýný ümit etmekten baþka yapacak bi sey yok bakalim...|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think this may be able to be -2 on good defense|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 7 karo bordu konusunda apel komitesine lokum götürmeniz gerekiyormuþ galiba diye duyduk?|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, he can be happy now he didn't:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: indeed |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|eggy: but slam wouldn;t be on anyone's mind (except Roland perhaps)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gulyas: opps bidding and raising his AKQTx suit:)|pg||
nt|othered1: Much of the problem with 2-suited bids is deciding on range,  which should be rather narrow.   Philosophy that you just bid your shape in response doesn't work well with wide ...|pg||
nt|othered1: range'  |pg||
nt|othered1: Even juniors can decide to pass flat, 8-loser hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: they grow up fast :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: but 2N is already too high|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 2Sa seems down |pg||
nt|fabsayc: for me, 1nt as passed hand not forcing, so 2@C promiss 4|pg||
nt|eggy: Sajr tells me that 2@D is checkback (presumably GF)|pg||
nt|eggy: apperntly N has shown 2-5-3-3|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Jaak, these are junior players! lol|pg||
nt|kastan88: for me N hand is pure pass, with flat hand why to put head under possible guillotine or push opps to game. But you know: Junior blood!|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: No interference can stop us/them from bidding game ;)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|voldenuit: they play high as encouraging on the queen lead |pg||
nt|fabsayc: if 2@C is 3+, seems to me east should pass 2@D|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yuval10: specs suggested further than 2NT was 20-21|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|kastan88: yeah, I have forgotten my junior years, they are so far (88oldish as you can see in my name:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Lies! You're still a junior lol|pg||
pc|hA|nt|z_lasu: boards 14 and 15 also good for Romanians|pg||
nt|yuval10: *that|pg||
nt|mug: not a compulsory slam this hand anyway|pg||
nt|yuval10: can explain why W didn't want slam, but not why she didn't correct to 4@h|pg||
pc|h9|nt|voldenuit: 2@c isn't gazilli or sth like that?|pg||
nt|xenya: evidently they are playing some form of gazzili|pg||
pc|h4|nt|eggy: could easily get home this |pg||
nt|eggy: they are a credit to Wald imo|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk3: If declarer suspects a singleton a club with North, he may well go wrong in spades, but he can afford it|pg||
pc|d9|pc|sK|nt|yo_yo: Houlberg isnt sure who has K@H|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Vugraphztt: is anybody who want to comment?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|MolvaM: doðu, @d apeli  vermek için paralanýyor|pg||
pc|s6|nt|voldenuit: nice defense |pg||
pc|d3|pc|s9|nt|xenya: so both 2@C and 2@D were artificial|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok in that case east should rebid 2@S :)|pg||
nt|cascade: Canonne needs to be on lead so we need these undos|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|cascade: well it is easier from her side|pg||

nt|yuval10: yes, this should be entertaining|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: I mean n/s |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4@s is the limit NS, and 4@c for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|z_lasu: 2@d = weak 6 in major|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mtvesuvius: Junior overcall :)|pg||
nt|ahalim: 4@S -2 good score, EW can make 5@H|pg||
nt|cascade: there is one cricket fanatic here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ovncylmz: 5@sXX= in norway-turkey game|pg||
nt|eggy: I suppose that the N hand os a "routine" opener nowadays|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Whereas Roland has no interest in it at all|pg||
nt|cascade: a strong NT overcall|pg||
nt|cascade: many play a two-suited 1NT in this seat|pg||
nt|yuval10: but EW has a very good save in 5@c|pg||
nt|mug: it will reach the five-level|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: right|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yuval10: long trail bid from N|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: trial* :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: S will bid 4@s|pg||
nt|mug: he may even bid something on the way with his prime hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: personally i prefer the strong NT|pg||
nt|z_lasu: 4@c = bid your suit by transfer|pg||
nt|z_lasu: 4@D = @h|pg||
nt|mug: now that's nailed him|pg||
mb|2C|nt|gulyas: Italy not interested in small IMP pickups, 3 gains, 10, 13, 14 IMPs:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: club lead works better for defense|pg||
nt|voldenuit: nice lead |pg||
nt|mug: Padon concluded that he had been invited to bid at the 4-level, no higher|pg||
nt|yuval10: can't see how N doubles, with 0 tricks on def.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|namial1: me too|pg||
nt|cascade: especially against pairs that open and respond light as so many do|pg||
nt|cascade: Canonne was optimist again with her diamond stopper|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Qx is not a bad holding for NT|pg||
nt|cascade: sure|pg||
nt|z_lasu: should be down one|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: will see:)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: so only 50... an excellent save|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, well bid by E|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 3NT by North happens to be a fine contract because clubs are protected|pg||
mb|2S|nt|laurentiu: 4 more boards to go ... and 4 more imps for France|pg||
nt|laurentiu: to make a recap ... Romania didn't play except 2 boards with big gains|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: wow|pg||
nt|z_lasu: and probably next swing for Romania|pg||
mb|p|nt|ovncylmz: good and true contract for me|pg||
nt|mug: must take tricks or they go on hearts|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he has more of a defensive hand he bids 3@s|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: true|pg||
nt|mug: shouldn't be too difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|ovncylmz: cant stay below 5@s|pg||
nt|ahalim: some badly needed IMP's for Belgium here |pg||

nt|MolvaM: maçlar 20 boardluk|pg||
nt|xenya: very -- still declarer can survive it seems|pg||
nt|gulyas: unlucky here, 3 aces offside in 5@C|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk3: Declarer in the other room got a club lead and knocked out @SA. The defence set up their clubs, but with the heart finesse on he did not need to play diamonds|pg||
pc|s2|nt|MolvaM: yani bundan sonra 3 bord daha var|pg||

nt|cascade: another IMP for France |pg||
mb|1S|nt|kastan88: yeah, for sure NS will bid slam, but how many clubs will bid West after opening?|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: W has a good sac in any @C game or slam|pg||
nt|kastan88: 6@C for pick slam?|pg||
nt|voldenuit: I wld have bid 2@c |pg||
nt|cascade: oh is 25 old :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|othered1: I must go.  Thanks everyone and bye!|pg||
mb|p|nt|laurentiu: on open rooms ... it was difficult to  bid 3nt or 5 diamonds|pg||

nt|vugraphztt: 6@S is on, even with the 4-1 trump split|pg||

nt|vugraphztt: Yes, but I'm a pairs tiger :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: junior Tiger?|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: You need to ruff two @Cs in dummy and get both finesses right|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: This is getting close to a Wald-slam :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Though the finesses are marked by the 5@C bid|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 3@c by nico?|pg||
nt|eggy: this looks pretty straightforward|pg||
nt|cascade: France did well to get to 4@H in the other room|pg||
nt|cascade: and then make it|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Once hearts are supported South is worth game|pg||
nt|Walddk3: We all know that feeling. No matter what you do, it turns out to be wrong|pg||
mb|2H|nt|laurentiu: on 16-th|pg||

nt|gulyas: bye Ed|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahalim: I have to leave now Adam, it's almost midnight :(|pg||
nt|kastan88: only 1 ruff: 4@D+4@S+3@H+ 1 ruff, you cant ruff 2 times, then you cant take finesse in spades playing 6@S|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Good bids by both Sorensen and Heim|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: You're right :)|pg||
nt|eggy: so lets hope it's on BBO|pg||

mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: ok, thanks Arifin :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: gn :)|pg||
nt|voldenuit: it's strange he bids 3@c with 4@s |pg||
nt|sybarra2: need to get the @S suit in soon |pg||
nt|z_lasu: 2nt = minors|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk4: But since the age of the players starts at 13 and ends at 25, it's not that easy to name the series. Girls, Women, Young Ladies. Take your prick|pg||
nt|gulyas: 1@D probably showed @Hs, and S reversed, showing a mid range hand with 54 in the minors at least, so N thought its best to stop now|pg||
nt|sybarra: N does not have a hand to "write home about" |pg||
mb|p|nt|laurentiu: here ... on 4 hearts contract ... declarer has to guess diamonds|pg||

nt|eggy: presumably 2H was texas|pg||
nt|gulyas: he hardly has a hand to speak of:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)   |pg||
nt|gulyas: it is obv that they have a misfit, so why move on, with such limited values|pg||
nt|gulyas: a good lead there|pg||

nt|gulyas: :)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: embarrassing typo, I am sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: and then there was one... :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Oh my|pg||
nt|kastan88: now much intersting, is there possible to win 7@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: The handes are mirrored too much in distribution, can only discard one club on the @Hs|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: @CA lead might help|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the more i look at this auction, the more i think there is a wrong bid|pg||
nt|sybarra2: should bid 4 @S now |pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: now just winning, taking finesses right|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Imo Mortensen's bid of 7@S is a bid reckless|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: You just asked P to bid a slam, she did and then you go ahead and bid grand?|pg||
nt|kastan88: more diffy with @H lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how are england doing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: 3 nt makes also |pg||
nt|z_lasu: he must find a Q@s but should be easy after double|pg||
pc|c5|nt|laurentiu: to be or not to be ... :)|pg||
nt|laurentiu: on the good side :)|pg||
nt|eggy: please don't ask|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: now even less options in 4@H|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: only option now: revoke :)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Good/bad 2NT presumably, but I am not sure. If it is, 3@S shows bad cards with a doubleton spade. However, Grönkvist is not to be denied once partner shows some kind of spade ...|pg||
nt|Walddk3: support|pg||
nt|Walddk3: This is just too much for declarer to handle|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphztt: Kib suggesting a forcing pass to show a void in @C over 7@C|pg||
nt|kastan88: oh yes my eyes old, club overruff|pg||
nt|kastan88: so lack of @S6 in South hand is trouble|pg||

nt|fabsayc: are we sure of that first double?|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: yep|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm not|pg||
nt|voldenuit: Nord isn't the kind to bid 3@c with 4@s he has put a @s in his @c probably |pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: U have to belive me:)|pg||
nt|xenya: oh we do :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we do and we don't at the same time|pg||

nt|Walddk3: He could well go 2 down, but it's part of the luck that it doesn't matter much|pg||
nt|Walddk3: They are 50's and 4@S went down in the other room too|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mtvesuvius: and the @c spots are perfect for declarer|pg||

nt|namial1: no |pg||
nt|z_lasu: 4 @s here, but couldn't play small to the jack in first round of trumps|pg||
nt|gulyas: can NS reach this thin game?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|laurentiu: 4 hearts or spade on this board for EW, and a good defence for NS if they will bid 5 of a minoir|pg||
nt|laurentiu: something is wrong here|pg||
nt|laurentiu: it can't be on south this bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: OR are STILL playing board 11|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: lets see if e/w can find the @H game |pg||
nt|cascade: so 25 IMPs with two boards to go|pg||
nt|cascade: it is closer than it seems since Poland need to win by 13 to win the GOLD medal|pg||
nt|Walddk4: France need 13 of those, but you never know. It's round 13, played on the 13th|pg||
mb|2C|nt|MolvaM: bu bakýmdan bu maçlarda son 4 bordda uyanýk olmak gerek. maç uzadýkça hata potansiyeli artýyor|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 3NT seems winning |pg||
nt|yuval10: that's remarkable, i'd say|pg||
nt|Walddk3: This is a very aggressive 4@S. On a good day you make it, but not today. All cards are wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztt: Meanwhile the Netherlands are expanding their victory on England: 25-5. France is beating Hungary by the same numbers, which brings them 5 VP apart in the ranking. We're looking at ...|pg||
nt|vugraphztt:  3 Denmark winning by 24-6 with more IMPs to come|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are you betting they find it?|pg||
nt|sybarra: want to be in what game?|pg||
nt|gulyas: if S rebids 3@Ds, they will bid and make 3NT, if only 2@D, thats where they will play it|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|MolvaM: 4 kör deyip kapar mý?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: they will be here when we return tomorrow|pg||
mb|3H|nt|laurentiu: easy version to rich the final contract :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: I dont think:)|pg||
nt|eggy: well if they want to call themselves girls that's fine - but at 25 i guess most of them are women :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: For the superstitious|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, if they can cash 4@Ss, they can beat it, but its hard|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: hmmm, bilim yapacak irfan|pg||
nt|hobakan: 3 kör e transfer edip|pg||
nt|eerbil: transfer oynuyorlarsa bile 4kör demesi daha iyi bence|pg||
nt|hobakan: bence de|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mtvesuvius: I'm told that 2@h is 8+ with 3@s|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if 2nt is a three card raise of some kind, need a bit more science|pg||
nt|voldenuit: one off in 4@s |pg||
nt|sybarra2: seems e/w not getting into the auction at all |pg||
nt|sybarra2: now 6 @H tricks and ak of @D later |pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: maybe 3 down is better|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: but i think will be only 2 down|pg||
nt|z_lasu: good bidding|pg||
nt|z_lasu: Poles at the other table may not find the game|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: 6lý körle yapmaz artýk canýmmmmm.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe down 2|pg||
nt|sybarra2: probably 4 down |pg||
nt|cascade: and each player has 13 cards - spooky|pg||
nt|cascade: south pessimistic with a spade misfit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This should seal it|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Takes a diamond lead to defeat 4@H it seems|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphztt: Denmark is 5 VP's behind France btw|pg||
mb|p|nt|ozgull: pass geçmeyecekse tabii|pg||
nt|MolvaM: geçer mi???|pg||
nt|eerbil: görüldüðü gibi gitti zon, muhammet de kýrmadý transferi|pg||
nt|hobakan: beyazdayýz diye teselli etsin birisi:(|pg||

nt|hobakan: merci paþam 6 kaybederiz sadece|pg||
nt|voldenuit: I wld have try 3NT with west hand |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphztt: With Poland tracing close behind: 1 VP difference at 124|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: But Poland is already winning by 25 from Romania, who is in last with 47 VP|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|sybarra2: should lose either k of club or q of sp |pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: 3N would probably make here, yes -- on a@C lead, it hinges on a guess, but opponents' discards on the run of @Ss might be revealing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: better is to use 3@C rebid multi-way|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: let,s see|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Finally some IMPs to NL|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: or as we might bid in NA, 1nt-3nt|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|namial1: and @s  6-1  !!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|z_lasu: not the best line|pg||
pc|s7|nt|eggy: a it hopeful not to seek refuge in diamonds I think|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Marion may well ruff this to lead a heart up|pg||
nt|Walddk3: She doesn't really need the spade trick anyway|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|eggy: not that it woul be much better|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Her spade cue bid with that hand puzzles me I must confess|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|mtvesuvius: This should make, probably with an overtrick|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and a few more IMPs to Israel|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: theres been a technical diff... game continued|pg||
nt|hobakan: 4 körün batarý?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 17. borddan da kötü elimiz geliyor maalesef|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it might have been wiser to stay quiet with the North hand|pg||
nt|eggy: still looks like N will make more than 4 tricks in this room|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes, playing @C was a good shot|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|MolvaM: uzun süre önde giderken geriye düþmek üzereyiz|pg||
nt|voldenuit: thomas won't open 1NT with only 2@h I think in the other roooù |pg||
nt|z_lasu: but hard to win anyway|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hobakan: mecbur AR trefl çekecek|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is the down 2 line i envisioned|pg||
nt|gulyas: he will have a red face if he goes down in 2@D and 3no would have made:)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|MolvaM: birçok seyircimiaz 16 elde þlem bulalým duasýna çýktýlar ama o elde þleme gidileceðini sanmýyorum|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 18. elde pardon|pg||
nt|MolvaM: onun yerine bu elde 4 köre batmalarý duasý daha yüksek ihtiþmal|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 9 tricks, next|pg||
pc|cK|nt|eggy: probably the odds favoured finessing the 7 on the way back though|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk3: hmmmm|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Did she really play it like this?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gulyas: has to guess @Ds now to make it|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: yes, losing another @C and 2 @D tricks -- S has an exit card in @Hs, so can't be thrown in|pg||
pc|sT|nt|gulyas: well done|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|yuval10: and we're moving for the last board of the day|pg||
pc|c9|nt|yuval10: she's going down now if E ruffs|pg||
