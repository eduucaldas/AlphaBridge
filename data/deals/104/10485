nt|lc: How many @S now by Berk?|pg||
nt|kit: but somehow bidding 2@D looks more to the point to me|pg||

nt|chip: maybe 2D - NF?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|1N!|nt|ahollan1: 2@D is NF|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Not easy to reach slam now.|pg||
nt|kit: this is a good illustration why negative free bids of a MINOR aren't a good idea|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|lc: No way Granovetter can raise this.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if NF   do you expect 2@D to end the auction with that monster?|pg||
nt|kit: This time he lucks out, as slam goes down on the stiff club lead -- but that is just luck IMO|pg||
nt|lc: Actually, a @C lead would beat slam.|pg||
nt|chip: We now see that Russ got pushed into 5D. Maybe figures other side will have a good save.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter explaining to Lair that 2@d immediately over 1@s would have been NF|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|chip: See, Lair did get his spade lead.|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kastan88: what to think with South hand, if partner saying, I have lot of heart tricks? So probably double was something, or South knowing partner doubling sometimes without tricks :)|pg||
nt|vasanti: young blood wants to draw blood:)|pg||
nt|kastan88: even 3@H is good sacrifice, as 4@S stay and 3@H only 1 down|pg||
nt|vasanti: loke jaak says ill advised|pg||

nt|asig: Even 5@h is a good save :)|pg||
nt|vasanti: kx and 2 aces also guaranteed shortage in @H in ps hand 3sp was better now?|pg||
nt|kastan88: North putting partne under pressure: why she is doubling without trump tricks?|pg||
nt|vasanti: 3@D from s might still save their game|pg||

nt|wwalter: he dose not answer :)|pg||
nt|namial1: i think declarer did not loose A @d|pg||
nt|wwalter: on @s@s lead it should be 2 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: i think i'd want to be in 4@S on that hand after this bidding|pg||
nt|tomi2: and because i don't know how to finesse I would win ;)|pg||
nt|kastan88: 5@S is possible sac for NS|pg||

nt|kastan88: this time North not so aggressive :)|pg||
nt|asig: Germany indeed bid 4S on 5|pg||
nt|vasanti: E hand is more like 4/5@C opening and iff ines chest|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: disciplined pass by Gronkvist  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: 3@d isn't too bad actually, and certainly a good "save"|pg||
nt|vasanti: off ones forgive bad typing|pg||
nt|yuval10: E had 3 options - 3@h/ 2@h and pass|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kastan88: now i think East can't stop  West to bid slam, or...|pg||
nt|vasanti: S s 2sp rather aggressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: dont know their agreements but one of both misbid his hand|pg||

nt|eerbil: 5@h dese de irfanýn pas demesi çok zor artýk|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: hmm. Treating that as invitational just doesn't look right|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well the missed Grand was flat|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that means a "push" to you shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not an easy grand to bid do you think?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not easy, void in partner's suit  never easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|eerbil: çünkü AK treflin dýþarda olmasý neredeyse imkansýz irfan'ýn elinden|pg||
nt|ozgull: pass geçmeyecek olsa 4sp dermiydi|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was actually in other room with some of that discussion |pg||
nt|sybarra: need our wits about us on this 3 nt |pg||
nt|yuval10: he went for the only non-juniorish option :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|asig: But also very effective, taking up valuable bidding space|pg||
nt|vasanti: sure finds p with good fit|pg||
nt|kastan88: occasionally not right red K in West hand|pg||

pc|h7|nt|murat: karo ataðýna, tref dama doðru oynasa  6 olmuyor mu ? iki tur çekip durmasý yeterli|pg||
nt|sybarra: always smile and say "thanks p"  (esp. for the @H suit) |pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes it looks hopeless if you are of a pessimistic natuer|pg||
nt|namial1: i prefer 1 NT opening|pg||

pc|hA|nt|MolvaM: neyse. frenler tuttu |pg||
pc|c3|pc|hQ|nt|yo_yo: now for the @H switch|pg||
nt|z_lasu: about 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@c, 2@s and 2@d losers are visible|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: he needs to play trump from his hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|laurentiu: not the good bid ... as at least 6 are on the table|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Adam and Arifin, you have a third commentator now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mtvesuvius: great, Hi Peter :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yo_yo: now he feels OK|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h by E should show some @d preference|pg||
nt|yuval10: so W did very well to play @d rather than @s|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Peter all the way from Australia|pg||
nt|murat: diðer masa 4de durdu|pg||
nt|MolvaM: acaba batýnýn yan rengi trefl olabilir mi?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: o zaman trefl çakasý tehlikesi var|pg||
nt|MolvaM: dolayýsý ile trefl dönüþüne as girmek zorunda kalacak|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: I think East liked his @DAJ 9 positioned over the 2@D bid, so East pushed towards a possible vulnerable game with the aggressive 3@H call.|pg||
nt|asig: Still one off|pg||
nt|vasanti: almost there but sadly dk wrong|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mtvesuvius: True, although I don't think it's strong enough anyway|pg||
nt|petergill: 9 tricks look possible if West continues to play it well|pg||
nt|petergill: @C10 looks best now|pg||
nt|ahalim: and if @H's were 3-2 even 10|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: true|pg||
nt|murat: güney karo rua çýktý.. muhtemelen 1 imp vereceðiz|pg||
nt|aupillon: test|pg||
nt|yuval10: now @h ruff and @c|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|yuval10: def. will have to open @s for declarer|pg||
nt|yuval10: or give a ruff and discard|pg||
nt|yuval10: so -1 it will be|pg||
pc|c6|nt|laurentiu: Diana and Lucian ... is a new pair ... starting to play togheter since the end of previous year|pg||
nt|petergill: then he should play the strong bidder North for the ace, not the queen, of clubs|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ovncylmz: -4?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: right, then it has overtricks when @hs split|pg||

pc|d9|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|aupillon: good and straightforward bidding|pg||
nt|aupillon: for a push|pg||
nt|pelepele: hi|pg||

nt|z_lasu: now down 1|pg||
pc|d6|nt|z_lasu: he should play hearths earlier, but maybe not suppose that hearths are 3-3 after 2@h bid|pg||
pc|h9|pc|dT|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Berk: "I could have bid 3@c, I lose 2 spades, 2 hearts, 2 clubs ..." Lair: "I could have beaten it with a diamond out and a heart back"|pg||
nt|kit: two balanced hands, two distributional hands.  Let's see who bids the most.|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe E-W "save" is a make?  Lots of handling in 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: We're still waiting for Russ to get back from his smoke break - now he's here|pg||
nt|lc: 1@S  2@H  2@S,  then South drives to 4@H and E-W ...  we'll see.|pg||
nt|kit: West hand is good example of:  When you are void in their suit, bid one more than you think you should.|pg||
nt|lc: Also, when in doubt bid 4@S over 4@H|pg||
nt|lc: Although 4@H is down, so ...|pg||
nt|kit: and when you have spades, there is never doubt :)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|lc: So, 3@H blows E-W out.  Must be intermediate.|pg||

nt|lc: Is there any chance of this making?|pg||

nt|lc: Not now, anyway.|pg||
nt|chip: certainly not now.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kit: East very luck that the lead didn't cost a trick.  Just because partner bid the suit, doesn't mean he has the king.|pg||
nt|lc: You wouldn't lead a spade, Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: well, I would lead a spade before I would lead a heart|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ: "you play upside down?" Berk: "we play first discard is odd/even"|pg||
nt|kit: so I guess that makes it my third choice|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: I like my aces to capture their honors|pg||
nt|lc: I'd lead a @S before I'd guess a minor and watch declarer throw @S and have partner look at me with his @SKQJ10x and ask why I didn't lead one.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||

pc|d4|pc|sK|pc|dA|nt|lc: "If I bid DIAMONDS, would you have led a @S????"|pg||

pc|d8|pg||

nt|sybarra: are we stuck?|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: no, small break|pg||
mb|1D|nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, but the Under 21 section started only in 2006, at World Championship level|pg||
mb|1H|nt|laurentiu: probably ... the only feasable way to rich that slam is to dbl with Diana's Hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: I like being in the "speed" room |pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: routine 3NT for NS here|pg||
nt|asig: And swingy boards :)|pg||
nt|asig: almost 7 imps per board|pg||

nt|Walddk3: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4@h is off on the @c split here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|wwalter: will make 5 or 7 :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: gm Ed :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello Ed|pg||
mb|2C|nt|liviu123: 2@S by W in open Room|pg||
nt|eerbil: içerde rua karo ataðýndan sonra oynayan piki verdi, sonuç olarak geçtiðimiz el de egale gitti|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Nielsen hasnt a bid |pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|MolvaM: 3@h mü kontr mu? yoksa ne?|pg||
nt|eerbil: EW 3@s yapýyor, NS 3@h'ü ise trefl ataðýna 1 batýyor|pg||
nt|hobakan: 3 Trefl|pg||
nt|pelepele: 3nt maybe ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not an easy bid for S,  |pg||
nt|gulyas: The x probably shows @H, as a xfer sequence|pg||
nt|gulyas: my guess:)|pg||
nt|othered1: might double have specifically shown @H?|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe so |pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ahalim: now slam time|pg||
nt|aupillon: looking at @d position, Nt is MUCH better|pg||
nt|aupillon: look upon the club problem for 3NT now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but he decided he had extras|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt I would find the 2 @S call |pg||
mb|4S|nt|ovncylmz: hmm|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yet another slam for NS|pg||
nt|yo_yo: nor me  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: lets see if his play justifies his bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: E finding it interesting that his pard has the A |pg||
nt|gulyas: anyway, they stayed away from the @H contract, a good start:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ovncylmz: junior bridge rulez|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: do you agree?|pg||
nt|eerdvegas: strange, just a normal game here|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 24hcp?|pg||
nt|eerdvegas: well I think all national squads would bid here the game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 3NT might dampen North's slam ambitions|pg||
nt|ahalim: and an easy one to play|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@c = cue - 1st or 2nd round control|pg||
nt|ahalim: you simply cannot misquess @D's :)|pg||
nt|ahalim: sry misguess|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT = non-serious about slam, hence 4@S cue later, since 3NT had already said that his hand was poor, so 4@C was a most serious slam try indeed|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S = 1st or 2nd round spade control, denies 1st or 2nd round @D control due to bypassing 4@D, hence North needs to think now, knowing no @Da opposite|pg||
nt|hobakan: :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: but 4@s will be interesting|pg||
nt|yuval10: and here it comes|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mtvesuvius: The leaders at the moment are 1. Norway with 101 VPs 2. Germany with 95 VPs 3. France with 91 VPs|pg||
nt|petergill: North decides slam is a finesse and trump break at best, i.e. less than the required 50% |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Tarnovski now wants to sign off|pg||
nt|aupillon: 3NT would have been best as 3rd South bidding|pg||
nt|othered1: Wonder why east didn't lead partner's suit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: even it was not a transfer sequence, (just a plain neg. X)   not sure what I would bid with S |pg||
nt|gulyas: good Q, he knew that pd had a singleton|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4 as dýþarýda iken zor|pg||
nt|MolvaM: muhtemelen 1 batacaðýz|pg||
nt|eerbil: doðu'nun bu trefli boþlamasý gerekirdi|pg||
nt|aupillon: but O/W have to take tricks QUICK|pg||
nt|aupillon: E/W*|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would rather bid my AKx than my xxx:)|pg||
nt|mug: North appreciated his golden cards in partner's suits|pg||
nt|yuval10: small @h now... and declarer will play A@h and another one|pg||
pc|h6|nt|tomi2: in OR both players downgraded their hands|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bily: thx all go to work bye|pg||
nt|tomi2: west opened 1@S that could be light in a strong club system and E only invited|pg||
nt|ahalim: wow|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: wow, well done|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Padon liked his club control and spots I bet|pg||
nt|petergill: Superficially, South might have passed 5@H, as the partnership might be off @DAK from South's point of view, but he takes the view that his hand could not be better and with no @DA ...|pg||
nt|petergill: nor @DK North would have bid 4@H not 4@C|pg||
nt|ahalim: albeit a little bit undisciplined :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: U26 :)|pg||
nt|othered1: good duck, limiting the loss|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tomi2: bye|pg||
nt|petergill: In my opinion, slam is not that great a contract, a bit less than 50%, so reaching it is more good luck than good management, perhaps.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|MolvaM: gene de 2-3 pik yapýlabildiði için kontrsuz -1 makul sonuç|pg||
nt|pelepele: was 3@s best bid ?|pg||
nt|aupillon: Very VERY dangerous board for France|pg||
nt|mug: so you think he will try to set up a cross-ruff, not try to develop diamonds?|pg||
nt|yuval10: then he knows West has 7-4 and it might help him|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: then @d to the ace will do it for him probably|pg||
nt|yuval10: he knows E has 1 or 2 @h's for not supporting|pg||
nt|yuval10: Israel has won 10 imps on board 3|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW there found the unusual vulnerable sacrifice of 5@h|pg||
nt|mug: East was very bold there to raise partner's second suit at the five-level on Q-x-x|pg||
nt|yuval10: W there opened, as i suggested, 1@s|pg||
nt|mug: much prefer to open the longest suit myself|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|ahalim: but you were young once too Peter ?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: lol|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: It's not one I would be thrilled to be in, but it's pretty good|pg||
nt|mug: strong five-card suits look very nice until you have to ruff once or twice with them|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|kastan88: West founs here good @S lead, as @D would give at once 3nT, usually not good to lead from 4TH Jxxx|pg||
nt|MolvaM: þimdi yapara geldi|pg||
nt|eerbil: artýk oldu|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the @C 10 coming down will help his cause|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|laurentiu: not the best lead ... now it will be quiet easy for french pair to fulfill their contract|pg||
nt|MolvaM: evet doðu trefl asý kazanýrken ne döneceðini bilmiyordu|pg||
nt|sybarra: was thinking a same Daniel,  but would worry pard would put me 4 of either of these |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|murat: içerde 4köre geldiler.. imp'ler gözüktü|pg||
nt|ozgull: diðer tarafýn 4c! oynadýðýný düþünürsek bu maç için açýk ara öne geçiyoruz|pg||
nt|eerbil: sonunda ilk IMPlerimizi alacaðýz|pg||
nt|aupillon: no. 3NT with KJx in @c. Otherwise NO more 3NT|pg||
nt|namial1: Well played !|pg||
nt|namial1: same contract no swing|pg||
nt|yuval10: makes it very problematic if it goes like (2@d ) P (3@d )|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hobakan: 1-0 psikolojik skorundan bi kurtulalým:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: what do ou bid then? 3@s ?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|petergill: A long time ago I was as young as Adam, though when I was his age my bridge was terrible, compared to him.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahalim: and the cards are very friendly|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mug: perhaps I can afford to pass if partner's can't raise to 2@H or double 2@D|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|yuval10: but against QXXX @s you have game...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think I would also open 1@s there|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: it's close|pg||
pc|d5|nt|MolvaM: doðunun trefl asýný boþlamasý defansý çok rahatlatacak idi|pg||

nt|ahollan1: how about if swap @SK with @Cx|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe then.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ: "I had sort of an intermediate jump overcall; I liked the lead; it was on the heart finesse; or a club onside"|pg||
nt|chip: I agree, decent defense and lots of losers.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 10-15 HCP, (a) 6+@C, 1-suit  (b) 4+@C and 5+@S|pg||
nt|chip: makes 4H unattractive.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2S|nt|lc: Important to know now if X=@D or a good hand. Hope they discussed it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: 4@h with a chance to make in the closed room on 52 ( no @c shift)|pg||
nt|kit: now how does South know whether to choose clubs or spades on his hand?|pg||
nt|lc: West has both cases covered.|pg||
nt|chip: At least he has both.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlike Precision   this 2@D bid does NOT show any values|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Lair sort of alerted the DBL, but no questions|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: Pass denies 5+@S hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: another good example of partnership agreements -- you have to have a general rule on doubles of artificial calls like this, and stick to it|pg||
nt|chip: Ours is it shows the suit, right?|pg||
nt|lc: We play it shows @D.|pg||
nt|kit: yep|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kit: And now another double, this one takeout|pg||
nt|chip: Showing the suit is my default with Lew also.|pg||
nt|lc: What will Berk do if Lair doubles again?|pg||
nt|kit: And if East passes it, they just might take him out|pg||
nt|kit: well, 5 tricks are easier than 9, so .......|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Lair asks about 2@d. Granovetter won't write because it's now after sundown, so they get up and go away from the table and he explains, not quite loudly enough for me to hear|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: effectively  all hands without significant @C support  bid 2@D|pg||
nt|lc: Pass would get 500, it seems.|pg||
nt|kit: now that seems wrong -- means the other side knows that a bid is alerted and asked about|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ asks Berk if they have an agreement about the DBL of 2@d and he says not clear|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|lc: Easier to pass 3@C in a bidding contest than at the table where -670 is painful.|pg||
nt|kit: East's decision a big swing there|pg||
nt|lc: At least that's my defense of my partner.|pg||
nt|kit: simple LAW pass, right Larry?|pg||
nt|lc: You guys can all pile on and say that PASS was easy.  Yeah.|pg||
nt|chip: not a good hand for the NS system. No way for S to avoid playing a silly contract (way too high in 3C, but if he passes 2c, could be a 4-2 with a 5-3 spade fit).|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|kit: You gotta believe!|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s3|pg||
nt|lc: Esspecially if partner has @D, pass makes sense.  But David's (and my) philosophy is try not to be -670 and win the match on some other board.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: figure  2 opponents guessing but only 1 partner|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|chip: The 2C opening could have had 5S and 4 clubs (not a normal precision 2C).|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wish i'd used Kit's philosophy with stock market|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, but -670 not as good as + 140.|pg||
nt|kit: 2 of clubs a very bad idea here|pg||
nt|kit: if it occurs to declarer to stick in the 7, that extra trick might be the difference here.|pg||
nt|kit: playing the 7 of clubs is saying that Ekeblad made a bad play|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
nt|kit: but maybe not -- that 2 of spades might be too small to compete with South's spades|pg||
nt|poohbear: Grovesnor is a play where the opponent purposely gives you a winning option when he ddint have to. Strictly to mess with your head|pg||
nt|kit: certainly South needs to ruff -- can't let that 2 of spades score|pg||
nt|poohbear: I am may have the spelling wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter seems to have the little diamond ready to play|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip: But then we have to wait till after the hand (usually).|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter didn't realize he was dealer - they explain that no problems just didn't know who was dealer|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|lc: East hand is actually easier to bid in Standard than in big @C.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: most players would play this 3@H bid is looking for a heart stopper, as it is.|pg||
nt|lc: This time, North had better lead his partner's suit to have any chance to beat 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Declarer will then have to guess @S.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lc: Is there any reason we can see that Lair will guess @SQ?  I don't think he will.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kit: well, this time heart lead is pretty easy|pg||
nt|kit: or so I thought|pg||
nt|lc: Strange leade, but will survive.|pg||
nt|chip: A bit different to lead partner's non-space consuming overcall (where the goal is to direct a lead).|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|kit: so it comes down to spade guess -- he knows South has longer hearts, so will play king of spades first.  And then ......|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: now Granovetter known to be on minimum overcall - especially for him -- maybe infer singleton @S?|pg||
nt|lc: Would Granovetter overcall with @HKJxxx  @CA and a flat hand VUL?|pg||
nt|lc: I sure would (the way my partner's lead).|pg||
nt|lc: But Granovetter is indeed sound.|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe for that reason, Ekeblad should not have revealed the @CJ here.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Lair checked the clock - we have plenty of time, so he's taking a restroom break and Russ is smoking. Back soon|pg||
nt|lc: Is BBO available in the restroom?|pg||
nt|lc: :)|pg||
nt|lc: Players are not allowed to have any electronic decives, by the way.|pg||
nt|lc: A good rule in today's electronic age.|pg||
nt|chip: maybe if you have an iphone or equivalent (why security on those is tight)|pg||
nt|lc: They actually don't screen or check.  It is on the "honor system."|pg||
nt|chip: But harsh penalties if caught.|pg||
nt|lc: Players wouldn't intentionally have a device, but they often forget to unload them and accidentally walk in with one in pocket.|pg||
nt|lc: Several times, cell phones have gone off and caused big problems.|pg||
nt|lc: Not at this event, as far as I know.|pg||
nt|poohbear: somebody mentioned a cell phone going off|pg||
nt|poohbear: forget who|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can Lair afford to win, and play some @D to get better inferential count?|pg||
nt|kit: not too safely|pg||
nt|lc: I don't think so, since North could ruff a @D|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe opponents would give honest count in @D.  :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lc: Maybe.|pg||
nt|kit: and he still won't know about the clubs -- that jack of clubs doesn't have to be remotely honest|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|lc: As North, you don't like to see that @SK.|pg||
nt|kit: and here we are ladies and gentlemen|pg||
nt|poohbear: Jack of @cs sure looked like someone who wanted to tap dummy|pg||
nt|kit: jack of clubs meaningless -- unless somebody has 4 spades, dummy tap is meaningless|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Schwartz in similar position but  2 rounds of hearts, Passell overtakes cashes @CA and exits @D|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

nt|Walddk4: However, 11 boards to go, a lot can happen|pg||
nt|z_lasu: maybe first imps to Romania at board 9|pg||

nt|ovncylmz: xfers also works|pg||

mb|1H|nt|laurentiu: easy 3 nt or 4 spade|pg||
nt|po-s: now 3D and North will get excited|pg||
nt|eggy: some might shade East as 1NT, but not the French usually, who are very disciplined as a rule|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahalim: sry Adam|pg||
nt|petergill: 9 straight plus scores by NS with 1100 just then - I think EW might feel a bit down at the moment. :(|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I'll bet|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's looks like a support X from east|pg||
nt|eggy: and 2NT a values raise|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and slam aspirations from robert?|pg||
nt|eggy: probably facing a weak NT, so will need perfect cards|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kastan88: misunderstanding seems previous brd again, 5@D without double, seems E made forcing pass, but West didn't play again that convention|pg||
nt|MolvaM: saðolsunlar :)|pg||
nt|murat: bu arada içerdeki masada rakipler çok agresif deklere veriyorlar.. bizimkiler bi yakalasa...|pg||

nt|laurentiu: and imp for Romania !!! :)|pg||
nt|laurentiu: I keep my hope alive! :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes but NS biidng his void|pg||
nt|eggy: I am told that by S 2 spades is 3 card support and 10+|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@h = @s's|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Mark Horton|pg||
nt|vipe1: about half of the tables made 4@s, half of them went down. 4@s-1 in open room is a good result for russia so far.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: When you feel down, it is hard to avoid giving back more imps. |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H is a sound contract, should make it and go plus, we hope|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@H is a nice spot, maybe an overtrick with the @h position|pg||
nt|petergill: I approve of both Wests deciding not to make a bold vulnerable 2@H overcall of 1@S. |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Craciun tells me that the Director has adjusted board 7|pg||
nt|aupillon: Have a nice day all, see you soon. Tks Charles and be right back tomorrow. Thanks all specs. Merci|pg||
nt|eggy: so this is a 4 card raise with 10+|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Robert has to pass, no interest by East|pg||
nt|eggy: Not sure that after 5@H this i even a think|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Glorious sunshine in Bath|pg||
nt|z_lasu: 3NT could be made here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: to 5@h +1|pg||
nt|po-s: wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: after all East is limited to 3 cards in hearts, so setting up the diamond suit may not even be that straightforward|pg||
nt|cascade: hmmm cold and frosty here|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 1@s shows 3?|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes|pg||
pc|s7|nt|petergill: In the other match on BBO, Owen for England and Ozturk both overcalled 2@H over 1@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah well Neilsen might lead A@S|pg||
nt|vipe1: i guess 2@c is gazzili, either weak hand with 5@h4@c or a strong hand|pg||
nt|othered1: 25 HCP, no major fit = 3N.  May make, too.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: ok, and this should make exactly|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|MolvaM: normalde batmasý gereken bir kontrat bu|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a lead directing double |pg||

nt|sybarra: might just hand it |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: oh, @c ruff for -1|pg||
pc|c3|nt|eggy: As Julien Clement says - 4S was possibly exclusion ..|pg||
nt|eggy: so a spade lead would not be sensible|pg||
nt|eggy: and S has told N to lead something alse anyway|pg||
nt|vipe1: this now shows strong hand with 3@s, nekrasova simply raises to 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @D, 3 @C, (maybe) 1 in each major |pg||
nt|gulyas: if he tries to play it safe by finessing @Ds into the S hand to avoid the @S thru, he may go down|pg||
pc|c6|nt|petergill: entries to dummy for @H finesses and to run diamonds are scarce, if @DA is ducked on the first round of @Ds|pg||
nt|petergill: Clubs get overruffed|pg||
nt|hobakan: 10 lu kör þanssýz bizim için:(|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Overall in  the event that is|pg||
nt|namial1: oups|pg||
nt|cascade: it might be more - I am told that 2@H actually made in the other room and it has been misscored|pg||
nt|chessmaste: But it had to be at trick one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Netherlands hot favourites to win the bronze medal, but Denmark has an outside chance|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hobakan: körler kamufle oldu sistemden dolayý|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|othered1: Not sure an early @D play is right, unless needed for entries|pg||
pc|cA|nt|eggy: Although his hand is very tempting, I think that West took control too early really|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if it was exclusion then Lhussier didnt know either|pg||
nt|eggy: well the club is not going to run, so probably a trump is best technically now|pg||
nt|eggy: that's true Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you were right steve, the Danes gained on the last board|pg||
nt|eggy: yep - fearless intervention in the sandwich position|pg||
nt|z_lasu: but not that way|pg||

nt|sybarra: this isnt good for Norway  imo |pg||
nt|gulyas: you need to relay somebody's hand out to be able to get there|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 nt looked quantitative |pg||
pc|d6|nt|MolvaM: bu arada önceki elde büyü yaparak, dua ederek, reiki yaparak veya diðer bilimsel yollarla 4@hün yapýlmasýný saðlayan seyircilerimize de teþekkür|pg||
nt|vipe1: seems like a normal 4@s. interesting how some pairs ended in 3NT, sadly we don't have auction from other room|pg||
nt|vipe1: some=two :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petergill: Website for this event is http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Brasov.htm|pg||

nt|eggy: N is wishing he'd kept his outh shut now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT is, in theory, 15-17, but ....|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|asig: good stop by EW here|pg||
nt|othered1: Not unusual for quantitative bidding to come a cropper here.  If north had gotten the long suit into the auction, south would have been very interested|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gulyas: but if S has a minimum, N should have bid slam already|pg||
nt|gulyas: agree, he should have brought @Cs to the picture|pg||
nt|gulyas: into I mean|pg||
nt|othered1: Do we know what range south showed here?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not how to bring the clubs in do you guys have suggestions?|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd consider south's hand 22+, and I'm not a habitual upgrader|pg||
nt|othered1: Hand is good enough for four NT, so transfer to @C, if available, then 4N.|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would say it is a very pretty 22|pg||
nt|gulyas: if his bidding shows 22+, N should have bid slam with his good 10|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N openings (directly or via 2@C) require very precise methods/agreements to unwind hands like this.|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe 3 @C over 2 @C?|pg||
nt|othered1: They do hog quite a bit of room and today's style doesn't require perfect shape, so . . . |pg||
pc|d4|pc|h5|nt|eggy: and so ends up taking a losing action|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|ozgull: þehmus ile güney dünkü maçýda çok baþarýlý oynadýlar|pg||
nt|eggy: One principle of pushing is that you are making the opponents guess|pg||
nt|yuval10: many players here play 2@d as 9-11 with 3 cards support|pg||
nt|yuval10: but i never though NS are one of them|pg||
pc|d8|nt|MolvaM: bu elde sorun yok. 7 trefl bekliyoruz :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yuval10: appearently neither did S :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|eggy: so that when they do, you shouldn;t usually end up taking a guess yourself|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|eggy: of course N was,'t expecting such good defence in the S hand|pg||

nt|lc: Looks like Schwartz did nose out that @SQ.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|chip: points out that a club lead would beat 4H (can't get pitch in time).|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: wow -- 3 to play, 4 to score   2 imp match|pg||
nt|chip: they did guess 4S in the other room.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: We do have overtime boards made & ready to load on the computer too|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: 3@C game forcing raise|pg||
nt|kit: this should be a pretty easy slam to bid -- both strength and fit are there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks - i'm told it was P. Hal Sims|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|lc: I suspect 3@D is a minimum and 3@H asks again.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Prob 3@S means "Shortness somewhere"|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe I'm making this up, but it sounds good.  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there were a couple of pairs in this event using  1M-2N as old fashioned balanced game force|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Berkowitz has written very neat, VERY TINY notes about this auction - even with my brand new glasses there is no chance I can read them, sorry|pg||
nt|chip: or perhaps a stiff club (low stiff?)|pg||
nt|lc: If it shows any short, presumably 3NT now by Lair to ask where.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|lc: Jan, did you use "neat" and "Berkowitz" in the same sentence?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Vugraphu1: Yes and "tiny"|pg||
nt|lc: :)|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chip: note that while slam is virtually laydownhere, if E were 6-3-3-1 it would be quite poor.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lc: Indeed.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even with computer -- my notes aren't neat|pg||
nt|chip: So W was a bit lucky to find partner with the right hand.|pg||
nt|lc: So, 3@S did show specifically @C shortness.  I guess Lair wasn't worried about being off @HAK.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Berk says that 3@d showed a minimum and 3@h asked and 3@s showed club shortness. Lair thought that 3@s showed balance with a little extra|pg||
nt|lc: Also, when no X of Artif 3@H, a @H lead is less likely.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: And now that I have looked at Berk's notes, I will admit that "neat" might have been a slight overbid, but 'tiny' wasn't|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lc: You told us "VERY NEAT" -- I have it in writing.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Lair: "good luck" Berk: "this will not require luck, it will require not making 7, which I'd rather not"|pg||

mb|1S|nt|eggy: I doubt the auction will be similar in the open room - for a start, I'd be very surprised should S open 3@C|pg||
nt|vipe1: misfit board, interesting to see where they stop|pg||
nt|vipe1: nice result in open room for poland, most pairs play 3@c|pg||

mb|3S|nt|mtvesuvius: but the @hs are troublesome|pg||

mb|p|nt|laurentiu: it seems that will be 3 down |pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: ly 3 diam!|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: only!!!|pg||
nt|z_lasu: Romanian pair playing 3nt at board 9|pg||
nt|z_lasu: only one pair have won it already, but unfortunately they partners played 3d X -7 :)|pg||
nt|mug: you'd think over the double East would have sufficient opportunity to express pessimism that West wouldn't have to reraise|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: depends if pass or 2@s is stronger over the double though|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, E has XX, 2@h , P available|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: but I agree with a 4333 minimum that east has a pass|pg||
nt|mug: so perhaps 2@H should be natural, pass should be so-so, and 2@S should be garbage|pg||
nt|mug: I've never discussed the meaning of redouble|pg||
pc|d2|nt|eggy: N will need to duck the club smothly to have  chance|pg||

nt|cascade: but the defense need to get their spade tricks|pg||
nt|chris3108: euh sorry :) |pg||
nt|cascade: and they need to do that now|pg||
nt|wwalter: now needs to play 1s|pg||
nt|chessmaste: But I think North must now play spades |pg||
nt|cascade: she may think a diamond is safe|pg||
nt|chessmaste: She has a count in the diamond suit|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ovncylmz: back*|pg||
nt|eggy: well done|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eggy: that won;t help the defence though|pg||
pc|s6|nt|othered1: All one or two spec who may have read Precision Power Bidding (not about Precision @C  system, which was developed much later) have heard about the Theory of Bounded Values, which ...|pg||
nt|othered1: applies here.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tomi2: 4@D was blackwood for @D and 5@C was 2 keycards and @DQ|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: what about israel performance?|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: denmark and israel are not good if you think their original level|pg||
nt|eggy: although he may try a ruffing finesse in clubs|pg||
nt|cascade: now attitude in spades|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Well done indeed!|pg||
pc|h7|nt|cascade: well done|pg||
pc|h5|nt|petergill: Natural bidding up to and including 4@C, 3@D suggesting 1435 shape, I think|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This should be a push|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: With no way to set @s up, and @h overruffs|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@d and 4@S look like cue-bids, with clubs agreed. |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|petergill: South's final choice of 6@C is a bit exuberant, but would be fine if dummy had @CJ or @DQ. |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: or Q@S|pg||
nt|petergill: 12 tricks if only he could get to dummy to enjoy the spade tricks - somehow. But he cannot|pg||
nt|ahalim: still too optimistic|pg||
nt|wwalter: nice|pg||
nt|namial1: good switch|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|vipe1: interesting that she didn't try to take more tricks by ducking the diamond and seeing what develops|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|lc: All of Lair's @H plays trying to show lowest side suit (S.P.)|pg||
nt|lc: A big difference in the "expert" game is the constant use of subtle S.P. cards on defense.|pg||
nt|lc: Of course, your partner has to be watching.|pg||
nt|chip: Though some are more worried about helping declarer.|pg||
nt|lc: I remember the late great Bobby Goldman once told me that he is an excellent signaller but not as good a receiver.,|pg||
nt|lc: My philosophy is to always try to help partner, who is likely to need it more.  If declarer benefits, so be it.|pg||
nt|lc: I know my partner (if David) is watching. Never sure if declarer is.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: board 57 about to be pushed at 6@S|pg||

nt|lc: I know you;d be watching, Chip :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Lisa Berkowitz had been turning the dummy for Russ, he just came back and as he sat down, he started to pick up her Sudoku book, but she took it - maybe he doesn't have enough to ...|pg||

nt|poohbear: 2NT in the closed room|pg||

pc|cK|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Vugraphu1: Sorry, he had the A out but put it back|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||

pc|cA|nt|mug: and this trump promotion beats it anyway|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||

mc|9|nt|MolvaM: 12 ve 13. eller çok yüksek potansiyele sahip|pg||

nt|lc: 3NT has only 8 tricks, it seems on @D lead.  But, how will that happen?|pg||
nt|chip: We have seen a lot of strong NT's this set.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Russ: "what were your hearts? A third?" Berk: "A 4th" Russ: "probably right for him to pass" Berk: "I don't know, might play a heart to the 9" Russ: "it's not a growth industry ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: passing with A empty 4th"|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lc: Puppet Stayman, presumably.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: How can Lair possibly find @D lead?  This is a little like Bd. 54|pg||
nt|chip: maybe 3C is puppet stayman, 3D no 5 card major?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: 3@D  =  no 5, but at least 1 4.|pg||
nt|lc: 4@H or 4@S|pg||
nt|lc: As on Bd 54, the normal 4th best lead instead of a @D from 3 cards.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  yes 3@C=puppet   3@D=says 1 or both 4 card major|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter: "what do you play again? Odd/even first discard, do you play Smith?" Berk: "yes"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and again -- i missed Larry typing that first :(|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|lc: Some of my students (sorry students) would manage only 4 of the 5@C tricks here.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lc: Any of my students that are watching, would get that @C9 out of the way, of course. :)|pg||
nt|kit: at least the level of the puppet bid was high enough so shut out the diamond overcall|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: but all would take at least 4 ?|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|lc: :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lc: So, Lynch supporters have to hope no @D lead at other table.  Hard to imagine an auction where a @D llead would occur.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|lc: A "Standard" auction, anyway.|pg||
nt|lc: And Sutherlin-Passell likely to bid 1N-3N.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same lead in other room and LC correct  1N-3N|pg||
nt|chip: In fact, they did.|pg||
nt|kit: which they did, and got heart lead|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|sybarra: ...|pg||
nt|othered1: People who Michaels on south 's hand (I don't) will find @C here.  More often, however, they can lose the unspecified minor.|pg||
nt|sybarra: too good for michaels for you?|pg||
nt|othered1: At matchpoints there's a case for bidding 2@C on the south hand, with a hep (and tolerant) partner|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would rather Michaels with it, considering the suit quality in @Hs|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am a michaels bidder |pg||
nt|othered1: Yes, too good for me, as I play it preemptive |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I play michaels as very good or bad|pg||
nt|othered1: this seems neither very good or very bad, unless  you downgrade because of crumby @H suit.|pg||
nt|sybarra: the @H is almost like a 4 @C suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: *like a 4 card suit |pg||
nt|othered1: Playing with my preferred partners, 2@S is an ASTRO cue, showing 4@H and 6@C.  I might try that here due to relative suit qualilty|pg||
nt|gulyas: wow, I always admired ppl who tried those conventions:)|pg||
nt|othered1: Been playing that over 40 years|pg||

mb|3H|nt|kastan88: 3@H= 10...12 3-card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Brave bidding by West|pg||
nt|cascade: i am told it is conventional showing three hearts|pg||
nt|cascade: i like 2@s with a fit|pg||
nt|vipe1: interesting thing in russian team is that volozhenin plays almost all the boards but swaps the partner|pg||
nt|sybarra: S wishing he had used Michaels |pg||
mb|4H|nt|laurentiu: 2 big gains for Romania|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kimisi ise þöhret yolu bu yoldur diye düþünerek þapkasýndaki bütün tavþanlarý ayný anda çýkarmaya çalýþabiliyor|pg||
nt|eggy: this looks pretty hopeless|pg||
nt|vipe1: he played 120 boards with nekrasova and 80 with veselov|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: In theory this should go down|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|ahalim: there goes our overtrick :)|pg||
nt|vipe1: would be interesting to know how they pick which partnerships play a match :).|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: 4 losers that are hard to avoid here|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|nt|vipe1: in 4@h, club goes on a spade, nowhere to go here|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: there might be an endplay though|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cascade: nice guess|pg||
nt|namial1: Well done|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am surprised to see that this was passed out in the other room|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|laurentiu: and easy now for declarer ... 11 tricks|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Not out of the woods yet though|pg||
nt|mug: West needs to duck the first spade|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ozgull: 300 ile kurtarýr |pg||

nt|sybarra: bd 10, 3 nt made in the other room while -4 here |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: right|pg||

pc|s3|nt|MolvaM: bu skorla biterse türkiye 7 veya 8. duruma bile çýkabilir|pg||
nt|eggy: Houlberg's brother Simon telles me that they play 2-4 through declarer|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and it comes back|pg||
nt|ahalim: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: FEIW, there's also a case for specifying the minor suit in a major suit Michaels.  Lets responder boost to he appropriate level immediately.|pg||
mc|10|nt|Walddk4: The youngest player in the event is Katharina Kaeppel from Germany; she is 13. Anna Christa Ege (Denmark) and Ida Grönkvist (Sweden) are both 14|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Matthew, after winning the heart A said "certainly not going to play that suit" but apparently hasn't decided which of the other 3 to play |pg||
nt|chip: same auction in the other room.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Had the club 6 on the end of his hand as if he was going to play it, and now moved it back into the middle |pg||

nt|robinswr: ekblad lost 4 final matches|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one spec said:  lucky he didn't qualify for Women's Trial|pg||
nt|chip: 4 finals this year, and two of the last three years in the open trials.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I'll leave this table up and report score here as soon as it's confirmed and I've posted on usbf site.|pg||
nt|chip: Fairly low scoring match, particularly with many wild boards.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: We have the score correct here - so Lynch has won by 3 IMPs. Out in the hall, Passell was telling his opponents that it was one of the best matches he'd played in|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Yes, but this will not help France's cause|pg||

nt|yuval10: things are really getting downhill for Sweden|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mtvesuvius: if 2NT is what I think it is, I cannot believe east didn't go looking|pg||

nt|MolvaM: 1@c açýþý herþeyin ilacý diye düþünülüyor ama sonrasý pek çalýþýlmadýðý için sorun çýkabiliyor|pg||

nt|eerbil: kaptanlýðý Doðu alsa ve ortaðýnýn daðýlýmýný öðrense, en sonunda karo damýný da öðrenip en iyi kontratý tespit edebilir|pg||
nt|gulyas: ghestem eschews the 3@C natural bid, and thereby lets you show both suits at once|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|eerbil: bence bizimkiler normal bir 6@d oynayacaklar bu eli |pg||

pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: but ghestem would have been 2 @H bid right?|pg||
nt|gulyas: in ghestem, the cue bids the 2 extreme suits (ie @Ss and @Cs), and 3@C shows the 2 other suits remaining|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder how wide a range west's bid showed on last hand.  We're getting lots of anti-Michaels hands here.|pg||
nt|gulyas: over 1@C, 2@D is the Ms, and 3@C shows the extremes|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kastan88: now here interesting hand, i would reopen 3@D this East hand, but may be she hoped partner can pass for penalty|pg||

nt|namial1: why 170 instead of 200 ?|pg||
nt|cascade: the endplay was unavoidable if the last three cards were accurate|pg||
nt|namial1: Poor dummy|pg||
nt|cascade: but well bid by south|pg||
nt|Walddk4: According to the K&R Hand Evaluator the North hand is a little too strong for a 15-17 NT. It is worth 17.2|pg||

nt|cascade: what do you lead around to a strong NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: a jr.  not opening the W hand?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: grand actually making in @hs here|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: of course no way to come close though|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps W had some other view about it...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|eggy: running scores on http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/VGRama/minirama.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|laurentiu: not to overtake with the king of diamonds|pg||
nt|yuval10: can't see why didn't she bid 4@d then|pg||
nt|mug: might have worked better for South to start with 2@C over 1@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: obviously was some kind of mechanical error or misunderstanding last hand|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|eggy: The problem with this hand is finding the strain to play in|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: 3swing for Romania on board 1|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: board 13'|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eerbil: yine gereksiz bi agresiflikle zona geldik|pg||
nt|MolvaM: cevapçýda 7 puan var. davete pas geçmek için kaç olmasý gerek?  6?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: "ortak 1 nt cevabýn yalan deðilse 3 de" konvansiyonu bu herhalde|pg||

pc|sK|nt|mtvesuvius: I think this may be able to be -2 on good defense|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 7 karo bordu konusunda apel komitesine lokum götürmeniz gerekiyormuþ galiba diye duyduk?|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, he can be happy now he didn't:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: indeed |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|eggy: but slam wouldn;t be on anyone's mind (except Roland perhaps)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gulyas: opps bidding and raising his AKQTx suit:)|pg||
nt|othered1: Much of the problem with 2-suited bids is deciding on range,  which should be rather narrow.   Philosophy that you just bid your shape in response doesn't work well with wide ...|pg||
nt|othered1: range'  |pg||
nt|othered1: Even juniors can decide to pass flat, 8-loser hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: they grow up fast :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: but 2N is already too high|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 2Sa seems down |pg||
nt|fabsayc: for me, 1nt as passed hand not forcing, so 2@C promiss 4|pg||
nt|eggy: Sajr tells me that 2@D is checkback (presumably GF)|pg||
nt|eggy: apperntly N has shown 2-5-3-3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphztt: Jaak, these are junior players! lol|pg||
nt|kastan88: for me N hand is pure pass, with flat hand why to put head under possible guillotine or push opps to game. But you know: Junior blood!|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: No interference can stop us/them from bidding game ;)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|voldenuit: they play high as encouraging on the queen lead |pg||
nt|fabsayc: if 2@C is 3+, seems to me east should pass 2@D|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yuval10: specs suggested further than 2NT was 20-21|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kastan88: yeah, I have forgotten my junior years, they are so far (88oldish as you can see in my name:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Lies! You're still a junior lol|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|z_lasu: boards 14 and 15 also good for Romanians|pg||
nt|yuval10: *that|pg||
nt|mug: not a compulsory slam this hand anyway|pg||
nt|yuval10: can explain why W didn't want slam, but not why she didn't correct to 4@h|pg||
pc|s4|nt|voldenuit: 2@c isn't gazilli or sth like that?|pg||
nt|xenya: evidently they are playing some form of gazzili|pg||
pc|s3|nt|eggy: could easily get home this |pg||
nt|eggy: they are a credit to Wald imo|pg||

nt|sybarra: bd 11,  e/w in other room found 6 @C |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: fun hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes, this should be entertaining|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: I mean n/s |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4@s is the limit NS, and 4@c for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|z_lasu: 2@d = weak 6 in major|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mtvesuvius: Junior overcall :)|pg||
nt|ahalim: 4@S -2 good score, EW can make 5@H|pg||
nt|cascade: there is one cricket fanatic here|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ovncylmz: 5@sXX= in norway-turkey game|pg||
nt|eggy: I suppose that the N hand os a "routine" opener nowadays|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Whereas Roland has no interest in it at all|pg||
nt|cascade: a strong NT overcall|pg||
nt|cascade: many play a two-suited 1NT in this seat|pg||
nt|yuval10: but EW has a very good save in 5@c|pg||
nt|mug: it will reach the five-level|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: right|pg||
mb|3H|nt|yuval10: long trail bid from N|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: trial* :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: S will bid 4@s|pg||
nt|mug: he may even bid something on the way with his prime hand|pg||
mb|5C|nt|cascade: personally i prefer the strong NT|pg||
nt|z_lasu: 4@c = bid your suit by transfer|pg||
nt|z_lasu: 4@D = @h|pg||
nt|mug: now that's nailed him|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: Italy not interested in small IMP pickups, 3 gains, 10, 13, 14 IMPs:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: club lead works better for defense|pg||
nt|voldenuit: nice lead |pg||
nt|mug: Padon concluded that he had been invited to bid at the 4-level, no higher|pg||
nt|yuval10: can't see how N doubles, with 0 tricks on def.|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|namial1: me too|pg||
nt|cascade: especially against pairs that open and respond light as so many do|pg||
nt|cascade: Canonne was optimist again with her diamond stopper|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Qx is not a bad holding for NT|pg||
nt|cascade: sure|pg||
nt|z_lasu: should be down one|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: will see:)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: so only 50... an excellent save|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, well bid by E|pg||
pc|s7|nt|laurentiu: 4 more boards to go ... and 4 more imps for France|pg||
nt|laurentiu: to make a recap ... Romania didn't play except 2 boards with big gains|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: wow|pg||
nt|z_lasu: and probably next swing for Romania|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ovncylmz: good and true contract for me|pg||
nt|mug: must take tricks or they go on hearts|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he has more of a defensive hand he bids 3@s|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: true|pg||
nt|mug: shouldn't be too difficult|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: cant stay below 5@s|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|yuval10: UDCA carding so 8 = odd|pg||
pc|d7|nt|MolvaM: operatörleri de uyarayým mý? :)|pg||

nt|fabsayc: call me crazy, i overcall 3nt with south hand|pg||
nt|cascade: another IMP for France |pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: yeah, for sure NS will bid slam, but how many clubs will bid West after opening?|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: W has a good sac in any @C game or slam|pg||
nt|kastan88: 6@C for pick slam?|pg||
nt|voldenuit: I wld have bid 2@c |pg||
nt|cascade: oh is 25 old :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|othered1: I must go.  Thanks everyone and bye!|pg||
mb|p|nt|laurentiu: on open rooms ... it was difficult to  bid 3nt or 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|kastan88: what now 6@D, 6@S or even 6NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: 6@S is on, even with the 4-1 trump split|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Needs some work though|pg||
nt|kastan88: 6@D too...|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Yes, but I'm a pairs tiger :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: junior Tiger?|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: You need to ruff two @Cs in dummy and get both finesses right|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: This is getting close to a Wald-slam :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Though the finesses are marked by the 5@C bid|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 3@c by nico?|pg||
nt|eggy: this looks pretty straightforward|pg||
nt|cascade: France did well to get to 4@H in the other room|pg||
nt|cascade: and then make it|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Once hearts are supported South is worth game|pg||
mb|2S|nt|laurentiu: on 16-th|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the double may work well, ew will not realize they have huge diamond fit|pg||
nt|gulyas: bye Ed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahalim: I have to leave now Adam, it's almost midnight :(|pg||
nt|kastan88: only 1 ruff: 4@D+4@S+3@H+ 1 ruff, you cant ruff 2 times, then you cant take finesse in spades playing 6@S|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Good bids by both Sorensen and Heim|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: You're right :)|pg||
nt|eggy: so lets hope it's on BBO|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s isn't bad, but it isn't making here|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: it's odds on, but not this time :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: only need to lose 1@h but both KQ@h are offside|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mtvesuvius: ok, thanks Arifin :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: gn :)|pg||
nt|voldenuit: it's strange he bids 3@c with 4@s |pg||
nt|sybarra2: need to get the @S suit in soon |pg||
nt|z_lasu: 2nt = minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: But since the age of the players starts at 13 and ends at 25, it's not that easy to name the series. Girls, Women, Young Ladies. Take your prick|pg||
nt|gulyas: 1@D probably showed @Hs, and S reversed, showing a mid range hand with 54 in the minors at least, so N thought its best to stop now|pg||
nt|sybarra: N does not have a hand to "write home about" |pg||
mb|3H|nt|laurentiu: here ... on 4 hearts contract ... declarer has to guess diamonds|pg||
nt|ahalim: was nice working with you|pg||

nt|eggy: presumably 2H was texas|pg||
nt|gulyas: he hardly has a hand to speak of:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)   |pg||
nt|gulyas: it is obv that they have a misfit, so why move on, with such limited values|pg||
nt|gulyas: a good lead there|pg||
nt|sybarra: get out before X's start |pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: ok thanks :)  and good luck|pg||
nt|sybarra2: super accept |pg||
nt|Walddk4: pick even|pg||
nt|cascade: if we raise to game with our 14 counts that might disuade partner from raising with a 4-3-3-3 6 count|pg||
nt|Walddk4: embarrassing typo, I am sorry|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mtvesuvius: and then there was one... :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Oh my|pg||
nt|kastan88: now much intersting, is there possible to win 7@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: The handes are mirrored too much in distribution, can only discard one club on the @Hs|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: @CA lead might help|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the more i look at this auction, the more i think there is a wrong bid|pg||
nt|sybarra2: should bid 4 @S now |pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: now just winning, taking finesses right|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Imo Mortensen's bid of 7@S is a bid reckless|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: You just asked P to bid a slam, she did and then you go ahead and bid grand?|pg||
nt|kastan88: more diffy with @H lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how are england doing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: 3 nt makes also |pg||
nt|z_lasu: he must find a Q@s but should be easy after double|pg||
mb|p|nt|laurentiu: to be or not to be ... :)|pg||
nt|laurentiu: on the good side :)|pg||
nt|eggy: please don't ask|pg||
nt|eggy: although we have a slight chance of saving the test match|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they used to be called the "girls"  but this year  have matured to "women"|pg||
nt|cascade: more embarrassing if you were discussing the boys :)|pg||
nt|namial1: a swing for France|pg||
nt|cascade: i am sure you are forgiven Roland|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: now even less options in 4@H|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: only option now: revoke :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphztt: Kib suggesting a forcing pass to show a void in @C over 7@C|pg||
nt|kastan88: oh yes my eyes old, club overruff|pg||
nt|kastan88: so lack of @S6 in South hand is trouble|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: What if you ruff with the @SK?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are we sure of that first double?|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: yep|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm not|pg||
nt|voldenuit: Nord isn't the kind to bid 3@c with 4@s he has put a @s in his @c probably |pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: U have to belive me:)|pg||
nt|xenya: oh we do :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we do and we don't at the same time|pg||

nt|vugraphztt: Not very well bid by N and not very well declared by S|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 20 bordluk maçlar aslýnda uzun|pg||
nt|eerbil: maçýn baþlarýnda irfan'ýn ters zon durumunda pas dediði bir el vardý .. bir önceki elde ise muhammet yine ayný zon durumunda çok daha zayýf bi elle araya girdi|pg||
nt|MolvaM: birçok kiþi 16 borda alýþýk ve sonra dikkat daðýlabiliyor|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=10&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Oh - they did not bid game!|pg||
nt|namial1: no |pg||
nt|z_lasu: 4 @s here, but couldn't play small to the jack in first round of trumps|pg||
nt|gulyas: can NS reach this thin game?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|laurentiu: 4 hearts or spade on this board for EW, and a good defence for NS if they will bid 5 of a minoir|pg||
nt|laurentiu: something is wrong here|pg||
nt|laurentiu: it can't be on south this bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: OR are STILL playing board 11|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: lets see if e/w can find the @H game |pg||
nt|cascade: so 25 IMPs with two boards to go|pg||
nt|cascade: it is closer than it seems since Poland need to win by 13 to win the GOLD medal|pg||
nt|Walddk4: France need 13 of those, but you never know. It's round 13, played on the 13th|pg||
mb|2S|nt|MolvaM: bu bakýmdan bu maçlarda son 4 bordda uyanýk olmak gerek. maç uzadýkça hata potansiyeli artýyor|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 3NT seems winning |pg||
nt|yuval10: that's remarkable, i'd say|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztt: Meanwhile the Netherlands are expanding their victory on England: 25-5. France is beating Hungary by the same numbers, which brings them 5 VP apart in the ranking. We're looking at ...|pg||
nt|vugraphztt:  3 Denmark winning by 24-6 with more IMPs to come|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are you betting they find it?|pg||
nt|sybarra: want to be in what game?|pg||
nt|gulyas: if S rebids 3@Ds, they will bid and make 3NT, if only 2@D, thats where they will play it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|MolvaM: 4 kör deyip kapar mý?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: they will be here when we return tomorrow|pg||
pc|d5|nt|laurentiu: easy version to rich the final contract :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: I dont think:)|pg||
nt|eggy: well if they want to call themselves girls that's fine - but at 25 i guess most of them are women :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: For the superstitious|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, if they can cash 4@Ss, they can beat it, but its hard|pg||
pc|d2|nt|MolvaM: hmmm, bilim yapacak irfan|pg||
nt|hobakan: 3 kör e transfer edip|pg||
nt|eerbil: transfer oynuyorlarsa bile 4kör demesi daha iyi bence|pg||
nt|hobakan: bence de|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mtvesuvius: I'm told that 2@h is 8+ with 3@s|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if 2nt is a three card raise of some kind, need a bit more science|pg||
nt|voldenuit: one off in 4@s |pg||
nt|sybarra2: seems e/w not getting into the auction at all |pg||
nt|sybarra2: now 6 @H tricks and ak of @D later |pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: maybe 3 down is better|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: but i think will be only 2 down|pg||
nt|z_lasu: good bidding|pg||
nt|z_lasu: Poles at the other table may not find the game|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6lý körle yapmaz artýk canýmmmmm.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe down 2|pg||
nt|sybarra2: probably 4 down |pg||
nt|cascade: and each player has 13 cards - spooky|pg||
nt|cascade: south pessimistic with a spade misfit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This should seal it|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphztt: Denmark is 5 VP's behind France btw|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ozgull: pass geçmeyecekse tabii|pg||
nt|MolvaM: geçer mi???|pg||
nt|eerbil: görüldüðü gibi gitti zon, muhammet de kýrmadý transferi|pg||
nt|hobakan: beyazdayýz diye teselli etsin birisi:(|pg||
nt|MolvaM: beyazdayýz|pg||
nt|MolvaM: teselli oldun mu?|pg||
nt|eerbil: 17.boardda zonda kaldýk ve geriye düþeceðiz|pg||
nt|murat: 17. boardda da beyazdayýz..|pg||
nt|hobakan: merci paþam 6 kaybederiz sadece|pg||
nt|voldenuit: I wld have try 3NT with west hand |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: With Poland tracing close behind: 1 VP difference at 124|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: But Poland is already winning by 25 from Romania, who is in last with 47 VP|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|sybarra2: should lose either k of club or q of sp |pg||
pc|sT|nt|xenya: 3N would probably make here, yes -- on a@C lead, it hinges on a guess, but opponents' discards on the run of @Ss might be revealing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: better is to use 3@C rebid multi-way|pg||
nt|Vugraphztt: let,s see|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: or as we might bid in NA, 1nt-3nt|pg||
pc|c4|nt|namial1: and @s  6-1  !!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|z_lasu: not the best line|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|eggy: a it hopeful not to seek refuge in diamonds I think|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|eggy: not that it woul be much better|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|mtvesuvius: This should make, probably with an overtrick|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and a few more IMPs to Israel|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: theres been a technical diff... game continued|pg||
nt|hobakan: 4 körün batarý?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 17. borddan da kötü elimiz geliyor maalesef|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it might have been wiser to stay quiet with the North hand|pg||
nt|eggy: still looks like N will make more than 4 tricks in this room|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes, playing @C was a good shot|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|MolvaM: uzun süre önde giderken geriye düþmek üzereyiz|pg||
nt|voldenuit: thomas won't open 1NT with only 2@h I think in the other roooù |pg||
nt|z_lasu: but hard to win anyway|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hobakan: mecbur AR trefl çekecek|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is the down 2 line i envisioned|pg||
nt|gulyas: he will have a red face if he goes down in 2@D and 3no would have made:)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|MolvaM: birçok seyircimiaz 16 elde þlem bulalým duasýna çýktýlar ama o elde þleme gidileceðini sanmýyorum|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 18. elde pardon|pg||
nt|MolvaM: onun yerine bu elde 4 köre batmalarý duasý daha yüksek ihtiþmal|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 9 tricks, next|pg||
pc|d4|nt|eggy: probably the odds favoured finessing the 7 on the way back though|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|gulyas: has to guess @Ds now to make it|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|d8|nt|xenya: yes, losing another @C and 2 @D tricks -- S has an exit card in @Hs, so can't be thrown in|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gulyas: well done|pg||
pc|h5|mc|9|nt|yuval10: and we're moving for the last board of the day|pg||

nt|eggy: At the moment France lead 24-6 in VPs|pg||

nt|yuval10: Congratulations for Poland - they successfully retained their 2007 title|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eggy: This could well make on a spade lead|pg||

nt|eggy: I think that South should start with a low diamond to keep communication|pg||
nt|eggy: and hope they can't do anything nasty n the round suits|pg||
nt|hedyg: he did in OR, and got a @C from W and 10@H back from E|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: I would think so|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: @c switch really kills it|pg||
nt|mug: thx everyone, really enjoyed|pg||
nt|yuval10: only other option is 2 rounds of @d, it seem|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: very strong, yes|pg||

pc|d7|nt|Vugraphztt: NEXT ON VUGRAPH (AT 17:30): FRANCE-DENMARK & RUSSIA- NORWAY|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eggy: of course even if West wins the 1st diamond there is a possible Merrimac coup (Playing the unsupported K) followed by a switch if ducked|pg||
nt|sybarra: this seems routine |pg||
pc|d8|nt|gulyas: yes, a very simple 3NT to end this set|pg||
nt|yuval10: they were as down as 21st place after 4 rounds|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@D looks perfectly reasonable once N knows about 6! Ds and an ace in S|pg||
