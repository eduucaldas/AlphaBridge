nt|mariner1: can E get @D rolling in time?|pg||
nt|mug: interesting lead problem|pg||

nt|mmmakela: my bet is @S 10|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mmmakela: lost|pg||
nt|mug: top heart caters for stiff @HJ in dummy|pg||

nt|kit: Smith could have pitched the king of spades at the end -- that would have made it clear|pg||

nt|kit: sorry, queen of spades|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|kit: But I think Kasle should have figured it out anyway|pg||
nt|robinswr: when kasle led the jack of diamonds, and followed with the queen that shows hearts and therefore smith should have discarded his spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H limited by failure to open 1@C|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer's shape was known|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D/3@D from Sontag would NOT be Game Force, but hard to bypass search for @S|pg||

pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: one of those jacks pulling full weight -- but not enough|pg||
nt|kit: an overbid by E-W -- of course if the king of spades were in the South hand it would be another story|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will anyone be surprised if this board is pushed?|pg||
nt|kit: well, I wouldn't have bid game on Kasle's hand, I know that -- caught a super-lucky fit|pg||
nt|kit: To give you an idea, make Smith's king of diamonds the king of spades, same shape.  Now Smith might like his hand even better, and game is basically down off the top|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both Roger Bates and Ron Smith know how to go into deep tanks -- who is it this time?|pg||
