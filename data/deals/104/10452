mb|d|nt|paperika: guess this is the previous hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Test|pg||
nt|rodal f: A back|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: I don't much like the 2@C bid or the double|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|buffytvs: 2@C is ok at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|paperika: hi all|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|buffytvs: but I agree on the dbl|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Welcome back to the excited conclusion of the tournament|pg||
nt|rodal f: And also hi for Ercy from Switzerland:) Nice to see u back:)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|nt|buffytvs: neg dbls should be resreved for hands with no other sensible bid, not used as a wide range 'I have the oerh 2 suits'|pg||
nt|lml: I would rather bid 3@C|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|kastan88: Hi all Australia from dark side of Earth (Estonia)!|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c4|nt|buffytvs: what's wrong with 2@H (unless that's nf)?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Sorry! i forgot East.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are 5@H on so a nice sac EW for 10?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|paperika: singleton, holding singleton trump is often not a very good idea|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|rodal f: I live in Norway Jaak. And sunny as.........|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rodal f: Hi all. Then back for 3. session|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Welcome back Rodal. |pg||
nt|rodal f: A lucky breake if Gill find it.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Matt:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Hopefully we have a better connection for the next two rounds. |pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Jaak:)|pg||
nt|paperika: 3 aces from the top and something more maybe. they open really light|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. And 3NT have the same promblem by an @H lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: So next.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: Burgess might have doubled after his partner bid 2@C|pg||
nt|lml: but I suppose that is a bit aggressive.  It would have worked though|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|rodal f: The web page for the turney are: http://www.northshore.bridge-club.org/|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Please hang on for a few minutes.. we are playing the same boards as yesterday...|pg||
nt|kastan88: and I remember after 3rd segment there was 76-72 score on table, what is right?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Else we have the 2 topranked teams from the beginning      at the final|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: The scores are right now.. in the third round, the carry-over scores were inputted wrong before that session|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we say 2 off? Can be 1|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Ok, we are being given a new set of boards and we are going ot set the files up now|pg||
nt|rodal f: THX Matt. So the spec at last session was right|pg||
nt|kastan88: tx Matt for clearing situation|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: OK, we are closing the event and restarting in 5 minutes! |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|paperika: hi everyone |pg||

pc|h5|pc|cK|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so this will drift one down eventually...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice to see u.|pg||
nt|paperika: hi frank|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we see a small @C from N|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i think its big pauses in the game that are timing me out.. |pg||
pc|cT|nt|lml: this result looks normal enough -1|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s3|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kastan88: all troubles starting here from North too weak opening 1@C here, i would open 3@C if this possible for NS, then no problem with strong partner, and can't overbid this actual time|pg||

nt|USBF: hi kit @H|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: everyone is seated, brief discussion of methods|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|kit: we can envision east bidding a lot of clubs at his first opportunity here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kit: N-S could bid up to 5@D, but this goes down on the heart ruff|pg||
mb|5C|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|kit: This will probably end the auction.  then, ace of clubs, 2 of clubs (suit preference for heart back), heart back and ruff for down 1|pg||
mb|6D|nt|kit: Kasle doesn't have much|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: this is just an overbid -- KJ of clubs basically wasted, so he really has nothing extra|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: Kasle doesn't have a workable falsecard here|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kit: Sutherlin will now have to decide whether to play his partner for the ace of spades or a singleton club|pg||
nt|kit: actually he does havwe a workable falsecard -- the king -- and it might have worked|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spec says -- should have played @C6 from dummy to hide the 3 :)|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|pc|d3|pc|cK|pg||
nt|kit: if Kasle had been sharp enough to dump the king of clubs, I don't know that Sutherlin would have gotten it right|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: Gill almost didnt score in the first segment so it would be nice to get something on the scoreboard|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: they don't play standard minor openings|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|kastan88: but sure , this depends from agreements about 3@C opening, may be they play destructive preempts|pg||
nt|rodal f: Page well wourth to bookmark. Then u always get the web pages for the turneys at BBO: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the clubs did look kind of attractive but I would lead a heart myself|pg||
nt|buffytvs: normal lead, but not one that will strike fear into the heart of declarer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: heart lead is Trick 7 right there|pg||
mb|5S|nt|rodal f: And we have the two top ranked team at the finale as I can see. Look at: http://www.nswba.com.au/tourn/res.asp?yr=2009&dir=congress/nssc&E=0&R=3&T=I|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|ahollan1: are Burgess-Prescott playing a natural system??|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|kastan88: watching from here, from Dark side of Earth (Estonia), seems that Australians opening all 10-11 points hands usually :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: think this always makes in fact|pg||
nt|lml: I think after he ducked the club he might have gone done|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: both have long history with Moscito -- Prescott has his own Modified Polish -- so the settled on Acol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oy|pg||
nt|rodal f: And here u are the web for this turney: http://www.northshore.bridge-club.org/|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|buffytvs: yes -- diamond shift then.  Tough to find|pg||
nt|lml: yes but the duck by declarer was a mistake|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: maybe thats harsh|pg||
nt|lml: he doesn't know the @HA is onside|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s7|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|buffytvs: and he may have time to duck another club, which is known to be to South so safe|pg||
nt|lml: South needs to cash to hold the uptrick |pg||
nt|lml: if he counts East he knows he has to|pg||
nt|lml: Burgess has the @sA/K for sure|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|kastan88: welcome back|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|buffytvs: and the D!K|pg||
nt|rodal f: The 2 teams playing now are the 2 ranked as 1 and 2 before the turney started|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|buffytvs: @DK|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|kastan88: needed to duck 1st @D for ruff  later, now declarer must decide right trump position|pg||
pc|c9|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: I'm not fond of overcalling on 4-card suits, but I admit it does look right on Smith's hand|pg||

nt|kastan88: So in real NS is Gill team and EW is Dyke, so pls read scores 10:3 for Gill|pg||
nt|kastan88: ducking @C sets up squeeze situation for 10th trick, |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: 2@S pretty clear -- but South might have responded 1NT rather than 1@S|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||

mb|3S|nt|me argent: 3nt by S?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Ron had bid 3N to show stops in both majors -- Gerstman NOT finding @DK lead|pg||
nt|me argent: nope|pg||
nt|kit: play in 5@C may be interesting -- we can see that it makes with heart finesse, but declarer won't know that is on and there are other lines possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is 3@S best try to find @D stop?     with 3@H worry about @S and 3@D worry about one of majors|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this is a 60 board match -- loser goes home, winner plays another 60 tomorrow against Schwartz to become USA2|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|nt|kit: If Gerstman pre-accepts, it will be easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: yep -- here comes RKC I predict|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit, Joey -- do you have any other super-accept other than 3M?|pg||
nt|kit: yes, but it really isn't very valuable|pg||
nt|me argent: i dont play transfers over 1nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: forgot  Canada=2-way Stayman|pg||
mb|4N|nt|me argent: easier less discussions|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|kit: I agree with this call -- bringing partner into the picture isn't going to help much -- it is Sutherlin who has the 2-suiter and source of tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: another good question from audience -- after super accept is 3N COG or some form of slam try - hard for me to imagine COG|pg||
nt|kit: 5@C shows 0 or 3 -- East could ask for queen of trumps, but since he won't be bidding a grand anyway I think he will just bid 6@S|pg||
nt|kit: clearly some sort of slam try -- you can't know to play 3NT with 9-card fit|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|me argent: i like to play 3nt as meaning i hope 2 take 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|kit: The super accept should always have a doubleton somewhere, and how can responder know it doesn't match his own doubleton?|pg||
nt|kit: This will make easily as cards lie, but far from clear what the safest line of play for 12 tricks is -- remember declarer doesn't know everything is friendly|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's why i asked about super accept - some show doubleton along the way others only have the one bid for good fit|pg||
nt|kit: there are complex things one can do with super-accept, but they really don't gain much if anything.|pg||
nt|kit: assuming 3-1 spade split, declarer has 6 spade tricks, 2 club tricks, 2 diamond tricks, and 1 heart trick on power -- he needs to find the safest  12|pg||
nt|kit: I think the best line is to take two rounds of trumps, one high trump in each hand, and then work on clubs -- but I'm far from sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is type of hand where i have trouble -- how many rounds of trump and from which hand(s)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: usually the amount of time spent on permutations is inversely proportional to difficulty of actual layout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e. if think long time -- trump 22, other suit 33 AND @D finesse wins|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|s5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kit: it looks like he is going to try crossruff lines instead -- I'm not so sure this is right, but on lie of cards anything will work it appears|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reverse dummy|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very interesting alternative that none of us saw|pg||
nt|kit: this is a reasonable approach, but risk various overruffs etc.  I still think working on clubs is better|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: oh I saw it, just didn't think it was best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry kit -- none of us MENTIONED|pg||
nt|kit: now how high to ruff?  That is the problem.|pg||
nt|kit: If South has doubleton diamond, need to ruff high -- but if trumps are bad, need to ruff low|pg||
nt|kit: This is why I rejected this approach|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: or ruff high, then rely upon @C33 -- i think|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if trump 31|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|kit: note that he still doesn't have a claim (from his point of view)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: @H ruff, @SA, claim|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|kit: It is the type of hand where if partner isn't accepting you don't want to be in game probably|pg||
nt|me argent: with Qxx of partners suit i try for game and bid 4@Ss|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|me argent: they sometimes make|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: On 43 danny said he would pitch dummys 3 diamonds on the JT of hearts...|pg||
nt|kit: 2@C is probably 2-way checkback -- relay to 2@D, and followup is a natural invite|pg||
nt|me argent: the bous is nice|pg||
pc|h3|nt|me argent: bonus|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hideous Hog said you have to bid some bad <slams> because so many good ones go down|pg||
nt|kit: nice stop -- in theory -- but if you go after diamonds rather than clubs there will be 10 tricks with jack of diamonds on and diamonds 3-3|pg||
