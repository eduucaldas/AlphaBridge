nt|robinswr: 2clubs shows a good hand so 3clubs shows a very good hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unfortunate duplication in @S to go along with no @C support and @D offside -- but 3N still rolls|pg||
nt|kit: but somebody has to bid the notrump if they are to get there|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kit: and now they are both scared to do so|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: would Bates bid 3@S instead of 3@H with 5+?|pg||
nt|kit: this could end it|pg||
