mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mrs q: if I had transferred to diamonds, 5 is cold....but pard will always bid six with this hand and play diamonds correctly and go down|pg||
nt|kareno: Good prediction, Joey, I agree 100%|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but if North bidding 3N  then it is East happy dream|pg||
nt|me argent: at trick 2 gerstman will play@DK|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrs q: this hand is fodder for brdige nightmares|pg||
nt|kareno: Heart lead however, will scuttle the contract.|pg||
nt|mrs q: easily|pg||
pc|h2|nt|poohbear: 3NT is bid by Sutherlin|pg||
nt|ahollan1: proving that at least some of the bridge gods are women :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: in this case -- when worth nothing it is good to be not-vul|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jeremy Flint had convention where 2N-3@C forces 3@D   that's about only convention i know where EW could get out of NT|pg||
nt|poohbear: The West hand is worth alot of tricks . Just need to be playing in 4@s|pg||
nt|poohbear: Or as LC points out. 6@d|pg||
nt|me argent: ambitous bid by schermer|pg||
nt|mrs q: I'd like to know what sadist dealt this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: throughout this set - everyone will wonder -- is table frozen   or are Chambers-Schermer thinking|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: that West hand is worth a lot of tricks -- or nothing|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|kareno: You and I are wrong, Joey :)  |pg||
nt|me argent: wrong|pg||
nt|me argent: :(|pg||
nt|kareno: Schermer making no mistakes - grabs the ace.|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cQ|nt|kareno: South likely to go wrong in hearts.  The spade position will be obvious at trick 3 assuming Gerstman gives proper count in clubs.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|me argent: this will be dificult if not impossible 2 make|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Interesting point.  If partner leads clubs, I think you should discourage with east's hand :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think South gets @Hs right when he discovers 4-0 spades|pg||
nt|kareno: And 6-2 clubs, yes.|pg||
nt|kareno: Still 2 clubs, a heart and a spade will put it down.|pg||
mc|9|nt|me argent: NEXT|pg||
nt|poohbear: wasnt there a possible red suit squeeze?|pg||
pg||

mb|1N|nt|poohbear: I guess a @h play breaks it up when West in with the spade King|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, entry to diamond threat removed.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kareno: Sutherlin will step in ... is this just hearts or Cappelletti?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|mb|p|nt|kareno: Not that it matters to Gerstman :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: not best|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|kareno: Very helpful lead for declarer.|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|h9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer might have tried to ruff a couple of @cs in hand|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kareno: I might have started with club and ruff before diamonds.  Good to elope with the low trumps when you can.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s9|pc|s6|pg||
nt|poohbear: I guess the trump spots are solid enuff to make the hand by force|pg||
nt|kareno: It's going to get interesting I think.But not interesting enough ;)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kareno: No, now club and he'll get his low club ruff.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|poohbear: Perhaps South should have ruffed the @d to play a@s|pg||
nt|kareno: Now if Schermer had known Allison's Law (circa 1965) ... there's always a ruff in the dummy  ... he could have saved a trick for n/s :)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|kareno: Definitely he should have.|pg||
mc|8|nt|me argent: NEXT|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
pc|d9|nt|poohbear: not relevant here but it comes up  alot|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||

pc|h3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h8|pc|s2|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|kareno: Heart ruff, then clubs and the defense will have to attack spades.|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c7|nt|me argent: in the end he will make his contract|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, easily.|pg||
nt|kareno: Did that really happen?  Ruff partner's good club?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Defense only shot was  a @h underlead to the North hand and a trump shift . If declarer misguesses then the defense could take out all of dummies trumps. While South still has a @c ...|pg||
nt|poohbear: entry|pg||
nt|me argent: sorta of a good play|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer would lose a @h 2@s and 3@c|pg||
nt|me argent: but to no avail|pg||
mc|9|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||

nt|poohbear: Defense needed to shift to @cs at trick 2. Must have continued @ds|pg||
nt|poohbear: @c shift gets 3 @cs and 4 red tricks|pg||

nt|me argent: that was exciting|pg||
nt|poohbear: This is how you keep the VG audience in suspense :)|pg||
