pc|sK|nt|chip: There is a losing line: cross in diamonds to take a club finesse to pitch a spade. That would work if N had A heart and club king (but then still would need 3-3 diamonds, so better ...|pg||
nt|chip: to play for hearts friendly I'm sure).|pg||
nt|ahollan1: culture shock for me during navy days  going from california to east coast.  Eastern Scientific partners would pass hands ala Roth but weak opening in 3rd/4th seat always resulted ...|pg||
