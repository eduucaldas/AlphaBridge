nt|sybarra: may not lead a sp with E bidding them |pg||
nt|sybarra: so @C lead |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I'd probably lead a @D, for I don't want to lead into decl's suit, not trumps and not away from Kxxxx|pg||
nt|Gerben42: good play by Rusch here, draw trumps when they have the balance of power|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|MolvaM: levent özgül hoþgeldin|pg||
nt|ozgull: herkese merhaba|pg||
nt|Gerben42: best to just keep at playing @S|pg||
nt|tomi2: E/W are both newcommers to international youth Bridge, I guess they are first time on Vugraph - so let's hope they will do fine... I am sure!|pg||
nt|andy_h: Usually in these types of auctions where 1 person has shown 2 suits and their partner took preference, is to lead trumps.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|davidb: N showed a good raise . |pg||
pc|c7|pg||

pc|d8|nt|andy_h: Sometimes they say, don't bother looking at any of your other cards. Lead a trump no matter what! (Usually will work 85% of the time I assure you)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Gerben42: Netherlands as usual medal candidates in this competition, but this match will be a tough one|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kaapo: And don't worry; it's easy to get something wrong at some point when starting a broadcast :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|d4|pc|hT|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ilk board sorunsuz|pg||

nt|MolvaM: bu maça girerken türkiye 23 tk arasýnda 15. durumda|pg||
nt|ozgull: milliler ilk 5 maçý 14 ortalama oynamýþlar umarým bu maç harekete geçme maçýdýr|pg||
nt|MolvaM: milli sporcularýmýzdan yusuf sohtorik romanyadaki takýmýmýzýn kaptaný|pg||
nt|MolvaM: takýmýmýzýn genel klasmanda hedef yeri kaçýncýlýk civarý gibi?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yorumcularýmýzdan görüþ alalým|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ilk 5?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ilk 10?|pg||
nt|eerbil: bana göre 5-10 arasý çok iyi bir sonuç olacaktýr|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ilk 15?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ilk 23?|pg||
nt|ozgull: her takým büyük hedeflerle gider ancak bence ilk 10 iyi olur |pg||
nt|tomi2: but then its most 85% of the time wrong to lead a trump singleton - what a problem :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|vugraphztr: Trump couped by pd, how nice|pg||
nt|andy_h: Then you get your heart tricks in return :) But if partner has some trump intermediates, you have gained :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tomi2: now they took the disadvantages from both theories I think|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so first 2 imps to Netherlands|pg||

mb|1N|nt|Gerben42: who would Dbl in S?|pg||
nt|ritong: a simple duck of the first @ss would have avoided this cruel ending|pg||
mb|d!|nt|kaapo: The Swedish bridge federation has put up a nice presentation, only in Swedish though: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.1917|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT might be 11-13 or so|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 2@D probably a multi style, showing a long major|pg||
nt|tomi2: Max Ellerbeck did :)|pg||
nt|andy_h: I would. Maybe South is worried about @Hxxx but that wouldn't detour me in not doubling. By X-ing you get 3 suits across|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: So for those who missed it, Poland came in first in the girls series, followed by France and the Netherlands|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would consider a pass here, but thats the reason I am not playing there anymore... I am too old|pg||

nt|Gerben42: good one for your system talk: is 2NT natural here or does it show no preference...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: The U26 Open category has a day off today, hence they don't have running scores|pg||
nt|tomi2: south is now "endplayed" I think he should try some kind of 2NT bid and wait for something good to happen|pg||
nt|Gerben42: for me 2NT is not natural in auctions where one opp opened and the other bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, then Nab will bid 3@D and will become declarer, thats the best that can happen to south :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi :)|pg||

nt|mdgraham: useful in these positions to play what you play over 2NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: only one level higher|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: bazý ellerde vugraf operatörleri oynanan kartlarý yanlýþ girebiliyorlar ama sonradan düzeltiyorlar|pg||

nt|kastan88: misfit on NS, possible that West will start doubling now|pg||
nt|kastan88: he was faster (West)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Simonsen is thinking|pg||
nt|andy_h: Very nice treatment of the 2NT bid in competition - showing 2 places to play|pg||
mb|d!|nt|davidb: Sp 3-3 so 6H makable|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d alerted as Walsh i assume|pg||
nt|ronpa: No reason to do something else|pg||
nt|mdgraham: here, of course, 3NT may be a club stop and running diamonds, so it is not so clear|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @C10 and a small spade from dummy?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|MolvaM: belki de 10-12 dir?|pg||
nt|eerbil: tek þansýmýz oynayanýn trefl asýný ilk 2 turdan birinde almasý, ki pek olasý bir oyun deðil|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ingiltere takýmý da genel klasman 11.si|pg||
nt|kaapo: 4@S is a great contract and 5@D an excellent sacrifice|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: France are at the moment at the top of the U26 group|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I can imagine S being especially unlucky, given his semi-wasted @S values|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: c|pg||
nt|andy_h: I personally wouldn't have bid with N's hand. All it's going to do is that it may excited partner (when you don't really want to given the void in clubs). Given N has 3spadeds ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: (marking shortage with partner) then S may still re-open|pg||
nt|Gerben42: i wouldnt have doubled in N either... what if pd simply has 12 HCP and good 6-card @C, I dont want to be anywhere|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Dbl of 3@S = dont lead that pd|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: Decl can't handle the Jxxx with W|pg||
nt|ronpa: yes they play walsh|pg||
nt|mdgraham: admirably direct|pg||
nt|hedyg: lead in either major gives a trick|pg||
nt|ronpa: and 3NT from West seat is cold on any lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|Jacki: Please let me know if you need to be ungagged|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so the way is free for quite some undertricks|pg||

pc|c2|nt|Jacki: and florin who is a vugraph operator|pg||
nt|yuval10: question is - does S unlimited in this sequence? i think he's limited , by 3@d|pg||

nt|minnie lee: good day to all|pg||

pc|h8|nt|sybarra: 715 am   dont let my fingers to the walking |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|kareno: 6@c an interesting contract e/w|pg||
nt|reisig: 6@d in other room...@c seems better|pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: Yers|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|vdoubleu: yes.|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, you can sustain a bad diamond break (or guess) in clubs more easily than in diamonds.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: More chances than just locating the dimaond J.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: you can sustain 4-1 clubs also|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N is going to have an ugly hand to lead from. (though not as ugly as to bid from). the deadly spade seems likely (deadly for the defense)|pg||
nt|kareno: Good raise by Lynch!|pg||
mb|p|pc|d3|nt|vdoubleu: Yes, key here.|pg||
nt|kareno: Only a club gives away nothing.|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N is lucky that E bid 4S|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: Why?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: confirmed 4d= blackwood 4s 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with no X of 4S, may avoid that suit on lead|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: OK., maybe.|pg||
nt|reisig: @c seems pretty safe|pg||
pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: he will itch to lead a trump, but finally wont i predict|pg||
nt|kareno: Finds a safe lead.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|kareno: South might have played the jack of hearts to give west some bad options (ruffing out QJ of hearts).|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|kareno: Declarer's pitches not boding well for this contract unless he plans to float the diamond jack.|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: hi all|pg||
nt|waso: hiii|pg||
nt|kaapo: First board, which we mostly missed, was a push. The double on board 2 brought Latvia the first 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|kaapo: More wild distributions|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would have overcalled 2@c   but if I was going to bring @ds in I would bid 2NT|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4NT is excessive|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree,  seemed a bit much|pg||
nt|sybarra: that lovely sp suited opened in both rooms |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: The strength of your hand are the @Cs, not your distribution per se, I think|pg||
nt|Gerben42: nice fit EW but no slam|pg||
nt|tomi2: you can watch Max Ellerbeck's nice defense to 3@S in the movie, he found the @C ruff in 2nd trick accorcing to their signaling methods and so they defeated 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Hey Leonardo, welcome back :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|MolvaM: ercan-gündoðdu güzelce oynamýþlar þlemi ama sanýrým pek alýþveriþ olmaz bu elde|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: It appers that NS could make 7@D|pg||
nt|kaapo: But perhaps they'll stop at 6|pg||
nt|tomi2: Dutch EW did well to stop in game here|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||

nt|henryb: cards lie very well for N-S|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|Gerben42: the 9 showed the @C switch?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can't really blame West for passing 2@C. Maybe East should have opened - his hand sure looked like an opening bid|pg||
nt|ritong: ok, time to wake up, jan|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: Ok that was easy|pg||
nt|kastan88: IMO problem starts from South bid 3@S, he may see probable misfit, but we must remember these ara juniors, so blood is hot|pg||
nt|sybarra: now how do you play 2 nt here?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Not so sure I would overcall 1NT here, I like 2@D|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@C is either: 12-14 bal OR natural 12+ OR 18+ any distr.|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes|pg||
nt|tomi2: and the 3@C bid showed the @D suit|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Dutch EW did not stop in game after all...|pg||
nt|minnie lee: results: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Results.htm|pg||
nt|yuval10: E did very well here to judge that her cards in the minors worth a game|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: lol|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'll bet East thought that his side was in a forcing pass situation|pg||
nt|ritong: if you don t , yopu might get caught in a bad spiral|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: My second guess is that NS play polish club|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@S is nonforicig, W will not believe|pg||
nt|ritong: two booboos in a row is not a good start, even if it costs few|pg||
mb|p|nt|ozgull: juniors ta belli olmaz:)|pg||

nt|sybarra: pass or correct?|pg||
nt|henryb: to respond or not to respond, that is the question|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: interesting |pg||
nt|ronpa: nice agreement of 3@H to play, but only 8 trix because of bad @H break|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like five rapid losers|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|waso: maybe 1nt 16-18|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|davidb: very conservative 2 passes by S |pg||
nt|MolvaM: kuzey açýsýndan grandþlemin anahtarý minör renklerdeki yan onörler|pg||
nt|kaapo: Where 1@C could be of several varieties|pg||
nt|kaapo: Here minimum balanced hand|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 5@S losing 2@H and a 1C|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: *@C|pg||
nt|tomi2: hmm was watching BBO TV and it looked like... sry|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Nab using Sabine's tactic: bid 2@D over 1@C whenever possible :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: West probabbly will do better confirming his spade fit some way|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s in OR|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D from North?|pg||
nt|sybarra: "we" may be playing at different level here  bets on over/under?|pg||

pc|c4|nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|yuval10: not sure what went wrong here though|pg||

nt|ozgull: karo k pik as olsa mesala 13 hcp|pg||

nt|MolvaM: böylece koz dam'ýný da öðrenebilir|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Latvia dont alert the 3-rd dbl:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: what would 2NT after 2@S have been? |pg||
nt|tomi2: 2NT does not exist but must be forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Curiously, the scoring system seems to believe there hasn't been an exchange of IMPs yet in this match|pg||
nt|ronpa: 2@S also goes down|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphztr: one down?|pg||
nt|waso: yes|pg||
nt|waso: one of each|pg||
nt|wwalter: 3@h was a little optimistic :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: team style|pg||
nt|kaapo: A kibitzer has read in the bulletin, that NS would play strong club|pg||
nt|kastan88: interesting, how now EW will find their spades game, I would bid 2nd round 2@S with E hand, IMO showing 7...20 with 5-card @S|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hard decision 4 Mr. Lauks|pg||
nt|kastan88: now it is hard to West find good bid another than pass|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: he will bid 4 sp?:)|pg||
nt|kastan88: but 4@H only 3 down|pg||
nt|kastan88: sr even 2 down only|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi I'm Frank from Norway, Welcome also to Geir:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hi Rodal & ty|pg||
nt|ritong: i think south would have bid if her LHO wasn t a passed hand|pg||

nt|ritong: assuming it is not a super forcing one:)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|ozgull: Burda 4NT briaz karýþýk gibi|pg||
nt|gulyas: if S bids 5@C now... well, 3@S may even be better news|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H now? or what?|pg||
nt|frusco: sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can North tell that South has four-card trump support?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure,  does that sound like @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: NE communicating in writing now|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is it all cues?|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@S is cue, but does it SHOW or DENY @S control?:)|pg||
nt|frusco: 4@d?|pg||

pc|cT|nt|ozgull: açýk odada þehmus 3h diyip sonra as sormuþ ortak kantitatif anlamasýn diye|pg||

pc|h4|pg||

nt|Gerben42: so flat board... |pg||
nt|tomi2: they will not be the only ones in that slam... |pg||
nt|Gerben42: if 2@S is nonforcing, what hand would West need for slam anyway|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: hi commentators|pg||
nt|tomi2: I always ask myself why 900 kibs come to OR and only 100 to closed|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: probably the name 'closed' is turning them away|pg||
nt|gracelin: normally specs follow the players they know|pg||
nt|tomi2: ok, we have the Norwegian Star Lindqvist playing there, but of course our players here are also top players|pg||
nt|tomi2: in this event they dont start with board 18 so you dont get extra results from altrady played hands|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|rodal f: The web page for the turney: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Brasov.htm|pg||

nt|tomi2: all through this event|pg||
nt|frusco: yes|pg||
pc|s8|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cQ|nt|davidb: now may make|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|kastan88: and 8 IMPs back to Norway, or N testing East in Dias?, no|pg||
nt|tomi2: now he has 7 points and one was useless, I think east's hand is a bit below minimum for his bid but I can understand his bid|pg||
nt|capercliff: the West hand is an 11 count I would open|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|tomi2: Poland was 3rd 2 years ago and 2nd last year in World Championships, Norway 4th in Jesolo and 3rd in Beijing|pg||
nt|tomi2: W could maybe (in case he was sure about partner knowing his spade fit) try 4@H instead of 4NT asking partner to sign off with minimum and bid on with maximum?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I don't agree with the @H discard here by S, decl could still have 4 @H, I think|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d6|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|nt|gracelin: north, before bidding 2D, may ask himself why the passed hand partner didn't say anying over 1C with both majors. |pg||

nt|vugraphztr: Yes...|pg||
pc|d8|nt|davidb: -1|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Gerben42: if he had 6x @S10 and @HKxxx would probably dbl|pg||
nt|tomi2: if he has 6421 than the @Hj won't score anyway|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kastan88: if North would played elimnation; and later cashing DA, East would unblock with @DK|pg||

nt|kareno: Won't make with a heart lead.  Declarer needs an entry to establish diamonds and one to cash them.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kareno: I play it invitational.|pg||
nt|kareno: Nope take that back.  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: it looks cold to me|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes, it does after diamond finesse.|pg||
nt|kareno: Doesn't need an entry to establish them - they are 3-3 with king onside.|pg||
nt|kareno: I took it back folks :)|pg||
nt|kareno: But, must grab the ace at once.|pg||
nt|reisig: spec are non-forgiving|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: No other play, he will.|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: right|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will exlution blackwood come for find 7 EW?|pg||
nt|gh1: a Grand slm here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so far almost always a swing in this board, 1 table bidding slam the other not|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep srry|pg||
mb|1H|nt|poohbear: EW will need to get @cs going to beat game on this hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: should be a routine game |pg||
nt|gulyas: this looks like a routine 3NT EW, with @Cs and @Ds both being very favorable it will be 11 tricks here as well|pg||
nt|capercliff: just|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|poohbear: 4@hs would make if the @d finesse was on|pg||
nt|waso: tell us about them?|pg||
nt|syl: easy PLAY|pg||
nt|kaapo: NS should end up at 4@H here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I can only imagine Barry Rigal's witty comments on this in the Vugraph theater|pg||
nt|sybarra: so we can get coffee?|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: 24 puanla 3nt. fena deðil|pg||
nt|kaapo: EW might win 2@D, 1@C and 1@S to beat it|pg||
mb|3H|nt|vugraphztr: I wonder what 2@S is, I think it's invitational|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h limit + probably|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep|pg||
nt|gulyas: you can even get lunch if you are fast enough:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: or not|pg||
nt|gulyas: I doubt they can beat 1@H more than 500|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 1 @C scores how much?|pg||
nt|henryb: nice catch|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: not clear they get there|pg||
nt|yuval10: N has a very good cards so i guess he'll bid game|pg||
nt|ronpa: so 2@S went 2 off and first imps to turkey. and now comes a flat 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: 580 or 980|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@h looks normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: somebody has information about his point range here?|pg||
nt|tomi2: looks like|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I hardly know any U26 players playing non-weak jumps lol|pg||
nt|mdgraham: transfer break?|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: without an early @c play declarer can set up a pitch in the @d suit|pg||
nt|poohbear: now they get there|pg||
nt|syl: first big event for all4|pg||
nt|yuval10: and he did|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or jump|pg||
pc|c2|nt|MolvaM: undo|pg||

pc|cA|nt|vugraphztr: & good bridge|pg||
nt|syl: in OR nonstandard partnership..|pg||
nt|waso: here regular pds|pg||
nt|sybarra: talk about a no brainer hand |pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer must realize there's no chance E would've led Q from AQJ|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: sweden alert Pass from west|pg||
pc|c6|nt|waso: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|tomi2: this looks like some 2 way checkbac auction|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2D seems to be a GF chec back or relay|pg||
nt|tomi2: souths 2@D is artifical and gameforcing, says nothing about @D's|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well this seems bullet proof for NS|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 3NT was in fact suggested by a kib|pg||
nt|sybarra: we can refil coffee 's |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Haha, yeah|pg||
nt|poohbear: not exactly a nobrainer 6C could have been bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: no brainer in 3 nt  |pg||
nt|sybarra: but you are right Barry |pg||
nt|poohbear: perhaps. Should that be East's bid? |pg||
nt|tomi2: I like that range, it gives you room in other auctions because there your bids are either NF or GF, like 1@D - 1@S - 2@C - 3@S... you can set a force here without using 4th suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: was that a joke Bas?|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh, E spoiled that, now we have to settle for 660 and coffee|pg||
nt|ritong: bas retranscripts undirect infos|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|davidb: should be a normal board|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: the players must've heard him/her|pg||
nt|rodal f: Other room roads splitted at 2@C. There 2@D|pg||
nt|gh1: i think is dificult too bid 7 now|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep |pg||
nt|ronpa: I think they play 3@H shows min with 4@H's and 2NT shows the better hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: not many still play 3@h as maxi and 4 card fit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe it s with 5 cards:)|pg||
nt|ritong: threatened with a @c ruff, declarer might go for the trumps and claim 9|pg||
pc|d9|nt|poohbear: need a @c lead or a @s lead and a @c shift|pg||
nt|poohbear: for the defense to prevail|pg||
nt|gracelin: usually it's played over a 1NT rebid, but here they extended to any rebid.|pg||
nt|tomi2: now he will support partnesr spades showing 4 card support and 12+hcp whil a direct jump to 4@S would indicate more shape and less high cards|pg||
nt|gracelin: could beat it with a low H lead |pg||
nt|tomi2: spade bids below 4@S would have been invitational to slam after 2@D|pg||
nt|gracelin: but really tough under the bidding|pg||
nt|tomi2: but after south bid strong and his screenmate even thinks now ot go on maybe east should try some agressive lead|pg||
nt|gracelin: Any other lead will see 4S home|pg||
nt|tomi2: "they are thinking of taking more than 10 tricks and I must hold them to 9 - then I need some miracle"|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mr. Simonsen does not appear to like passing just yet|pg||
nt|gracelin: but it's always the case when opponent bid to a game|pg||
nt|tomi2: does anybody know if N/S are a long time partnership?|pg||
nt|yuval10: probably " i want @h lead"|pg||
pc|d2|nt|syl: the pld rebid problem: 1@d-1@S-? 1444|pg||
nt|rodal f: E are asking in 4NT so exlution gone there|pg||
nt|gh1: stop in 6dia in open|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I think the better bidding is 3diam not 3 clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ended 6@D|pg||
nt|frusco: eheheh |pg||
nt|ritong: he is not at the table|pg||
nt|capercliff: im trying to work out if 6@s can be made|pg||
nt|capercliff: I think it can on a squeeze|pg||
pc|d7|nt|MolvaM: kör ataðýna zorlanýr mý?|pg||
nt|andy_h: Not that I play it myself, but there's a decent case for playing these 2M jumps as invitational - in that if you have an invitational hand, you don't need to bid 1@S as, if the ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: auction gets competitive, you may need to guess whether to still bid 3@S or not|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would bid 3@d with the E hand, maxi, 4 card fit, doubleton @d|pg||
nt|frusco: the mouse is alive...|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: do U think they know abou diam fit?:)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|tomi2: maybe north took 4@S as some splinter bid for either hearts or dias or so? I am just suggesting|pg||
nt|gracelin: As thomas said, south will bid less spades after 2D if he has slam ambition|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 'about'|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why don't E show the @D support?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: when?|pg||
nt|gh1: i think he bid 4dia now|pg||
nt|yuval10: that surely made declarer's work even easier|pg||
pc|c5|nt|waso: u teach bridge at schools?|pg||
nt|syl: *old|pg||
nt|syl: nope|pg||
nt|waso: only clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: After 2@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: do U think 3clubs is diam support?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|davidb: same bidding same contract in OR|pg||
nt|ozgull: direkt 2NT birþeye tranfer olduðu için böyle yapmak zorunda olsa gerek|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2 kör, 2 karo ve 1 trefl lövesi?|pg||
nt|eerbil: kör ataðý gelse de defans trefl lövesine yetiþemiyor|pg||
nt|gracelin: or north treated 4S as kick-back with Heart agreed ?|pg||
nt|tomi2: zatorski chose the safe way of just raising to 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mr Skjetne is surprised to have the tray returned back empty|pg||
nt|andy_h: One major downside of course, is that you prevent partner from describing the nature of their hand as 2M takes up a lot of room.|pg||
nt|capercliff: N cannot protect both @h and @c, but perhaps he is pitching after dummy|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sonuç olarak bu borddan kaybýmýz olmayacaðýný görmek iyi|pg||
nt|eerbil: oynayan kör as alýnca yerden karo oynayýp 10'lu empasý yapmasý gerek|pg||
nt|ozgull: en azýndan karoyu bilmesi lazým|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|tomi2: because partner did not reverse and they are plying together just this year because Wiankowskis Partner is too old for this event|pg||
pc|dA|nt|poohbear: has an awfully good hand opposite a strong JS|pg||
pc|d3|nt|poohbear: I prefer 3H|pg||
nt|rodal f: Itake that as color. Might they have an other deel|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nope|pg||
nt|rodal f: deal|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no deal|pg||
nt|yuval10: now @h ruff and claim|pg||

nt|gracelin: at least 13 imps|pg||
nt|gracelin: I will blame their coach for this kind of accident.|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, but they should work on their system and this is one of the fragment you should have agreed|pg||
nt|Gerben42: which is why you dont play 2@S as GF :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|capercliff: 6@c as it happens has no chance at all|pg||
pc|d8|nt|poohbear: So no need to play the King|pg||

nt|sybarra: nah  its bridge! |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Who expects to go down 800 and gain 6 IMPs?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I guess the 2 first-round controls made it 1@S, with 6412 I would go 2@H|pg||
nt|mildredb: some really foul breaking suits |pg||
nt|andy_h: Bad breaks for whoever becomes declarer|pg||
nt|tomi2: wonder if South said "thank you partner" when his dummy came down in OR|pg||
nt|henryb: but lead said no stiff club, unless it was led -- and then he could not help it|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: I think EW play 10-13 1NT when non-vulnerable|pg||

nt|gh1: Ax in H ig spade lead|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: Bogen actually alerted 3@H, Johansen did not...|pg||
nt|sybarra: need to agree with pard whether this bid is asking or telling |pg||
nt|rodal f: A good try also in 3@SNS|pg||

nt|Gerben42: only can E act ?|pg||
nt|tomi2: I have been told there has been a revoke in OR|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@c means " i have a good hand but no convenient bid"|pg||
nt|sybarra: so whats wrong with 2 @H|pg||
nt|ritong: strength|pg||
nt|gulyas: he has a better hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ozgull: 11 daha çok iyi baþladýk|pg||
nt|kaapo: Or 4 :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: or just forcing |pg||
nt|mikael_w: I have not have time ro look ar rhe systems, Do E/W play 12-14 nt ?|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|davidb: good lead .needs 10 only to be a good one better than Sp|pg||
nt|gracelin: he is braver and bid the higher contract|pg||
nt|kastan88: now @D shift?|pg||
nt|gh1: now a x and 3H:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: -1 looks very cheap|pg||
nt|tomi2: and after my p bids 3@S I would not say thank you partner as south!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 3@S was easy to Dbl, maybe a Dbl of 2@H would have been already correct|pg||
nt|ritong: and 3@h tends to show 5|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@H would not give credit to his 18 count|pg||
nt|mdgraham: allows a jump to 3@H to show 5/5 shape at least|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: And how do you bid a 14 HCP 5-4 @S-@C?|pg||
nt|capercliff: can anyone tell me what E/W are playing?|pg||
nt|capercliff: could be precision|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yes, strong @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: Game is decent but would go down unless declarer could ferret out the offside singleton King|pg||
nt|kaapo: Both major suits are nicely|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|ort21: tx |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@S should deny as many as three hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: S denied 3+ cards in @H i believe|pg||
nt|ritong: personnally i open 2@s|pg||
nt|henryb: I wonder whether 4@d shows a void|pg||
nt|ritong: when east is short in @ds with a good hand, all his features necessarily work good, from west s point of view|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|poohbear: not impossible if he finds out about Souths honors|pg||
nt|sybarra: well whatever works in your system |pg||
nt|ritong: but i do not play gazzilli|pg||
nt|ritong: i play "ritong", modestly lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: but 3 @H to me does not promise 5 |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Di Franco looking rather agitated|pg||
nt|mdgraham: every convention has a price|pg||
mb|p|nt|mildredb: i would play X of 3@D as penalty by west|pg||
nt|andy_h: It's a bit unclear whether E should act over (3@D)-P-(P)-   (I wouldn't) but now the 3@S makes it easier!|pg||
nt|yuval10: some may think that the bidding was switched, but it wasn't...|pg||
nt|gulyas: you have to give up something to gain something|pg||
nt|sybarra: as long as you and pard play same system |pg||
nt|ritong: give up on weak two is not such a big deal|pg||
nt|capercliff: it is im informed, with transfers usually|pg||
nt|ritong: it certainly doesn t henry|pg||
nt|henryb: it could, with 3@d showing a stiff|pg||
nt|ritong: good point|pg||
mb|6D!|nt|tomi2: I am confident that my former junior partner would have bid 3nt, so I hope he is sitting south in his match :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: but even if south declarered 3NT, West might cash CK then shift to HQ|pg||
nt|gracelin: for the same two down|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mr Sikora has his head on the table now|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: As soon as the @SJ came down Nab thanked :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think I would lead a club in this auction, trying to get "natural" tricks first|pg||
nt|Gerben42: as I said, I would dbl 2@H|pg||
nt|Gerben42: after that, the party starts :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: as EW play mini-NT |pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is comfy - take a club ruff in dummy |pg||
nt|mikael_w: But even whith strong @c E:s hand sure look like a NT-opening |pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: yeah, it is easy to say here, if we can see all hands, not easy to find right switch for West|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Good X, 4@S should go off a few|pg||
nt|sybarra: think so |pg||
nt|yuval10: and yet another disaster for Sweden in the OR|pg||
nt|hedyg: this should make nicely|pg||
nt|henryb: but no; 6@d showed the void|pg||
nt|henryb: I think a @s lead beats 7|pg||
mb|7H|nt|gracelin: bidding was wierd in closed room.  North opened 2C and NS stopped in 4D.|pg||
nt|ritong: also, you can have multi 2@d and 2@c for any strong hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: it is a good treatment to play 1M-1NT-2NT as forcing to game, with 54, or 6+ in your main suit, and jump shifts showing 55 and also GF|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nice bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: arda ve erdem bu elden 11 kazanacaklarýný düþünmüyordur herhalde.|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Don't agree with 4@S btw|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: I meant in ope room|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C was for both majors weak|pg||
nt|tomi2: sinche they bid 3 suits and my partner also I think club is the one I can expect to get most|pg||
nt|ritong: o_0?|pg||
nt|henryb: 7@h surely|pg||
nt|henryb: this was well bid|pg||
nt|ritong: not dow<n yet|pg||
nt|henryb: operator; 7@d is a very unlikely bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: South should try to conceal honors by winning the Ace of ! and returning the Q|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: N bid 1H with 3 cards. Maybe is transfer for spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I lie:)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|poohbear: @cs|pg||
nt|kaapo: So there isn't much in the play|pg||
nt|hedyg: just ruff it!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: Stafie's pard opened the bidding and he has good hand with K of @S,   and will look for signal for entry |pg||
nt|tomi2: hope W will not play @SA|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes looks like it would qualify for a 14-16|pg||
nt|ritong: but if declarer tries to join his hand via @c J...|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'm not sure what was the 1@h overcall by N in the OR, a psych possible, over 1@c strong when P is passed hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|henryb: white lie. now relatively easy: @d ruff, @s, @d ruff @hQ, @sA, draw trumps and claim|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: sorry She |pg||
nt|rodal f: Home if J@C are to be found|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Gerben42: Tomi he played before :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it backfired big time|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kastan88: now @D|pg||
nt|tomi2: last week I pinned two singleton honors with my partners, I am expert in this :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Tough @HA underlead here|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: 7 diam was more interesting:)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d8|nt|Gerben42: 300 extra now :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yuval10: i think it was a psych,hence S's 2@h|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer has seen 12 points in south. If he sees the QJ of @h or if he sees no overuff in @ds then he prob gets it right|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thinking|pg||
nt|poohbear: On the previous 2 boards Russia scored 7 then 12|pg||
nt|gh1: and -1|pg||
nt|gulyas: gazilli fills another gap, where you are 16-18(19), and try to figure out what and how high to play (2@D usually shows 8+, and sets a GF)|pg||
nt|henryb: to explain the auction: 4N was "Roman key card blackwood", 5@c showed one or four of the 5 keys, 5@d asked about the @hQ, 6@d said "I've got that and a surprise in @d|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|poohbear: yes terrible holding in everysuit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: S should play another @H now|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphztr: ufffff|pg||
nt|hedyg: they claim fast too|pg||
nt|ronpa: Other table in 2@D so will be another flat one|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: they are fast....|pg||
pc|hT|nt|davidb: Israel will be on the board as 1Nt  in OR  |pg||
nt|mikael_w: Now cash the @cK BEFORE @s return|pg||
pc|s3|nt|henryb: now he just has to guess right in how to reenter his hand|pg||
nt|ritong: nah|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|henryb: this was badly done|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d5|nt|henryb: and he deserves his loss|pg||
mc|12|nt|Gerben42: always good feeling to get 1100 early in a long match, especially in your first match in a tournament|pg||

nt|mildredb: wow, no one has a void :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: and things starts very well for the 5th seeded team|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I am realy glad when I see this realy young players stop and think hard whith only 6 cards left and then do the right thing|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|vugraphztr: I think 3@S was an overbid too, for that matter|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mariner1: hi all, in from the Open|pg||
nt|waso: 5c  -1|pg||
nt|hedyg: slam time|pg||
nt|henryb: and only if South has them|pg||
nt|ritong: however, the "bad spiral" we talked about previously seems to get in place|pg||
mb|d|nt|davidb: great  grand ! but not easy to reach even 6 .perfect fit. void vs o points|pg||
nt|tomi2: watching the other results on hand 5 you see some could stop in 2@S or 3@D and did not get doubled, only 3@S and upwards got punished|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think nobody was going to double 3@D here too|pg||
nt|hedyg: bergen raise|pg||
nt|ronpa: 3@C is 6-9 and 4@S's, and he has to be carefull|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: they dont explain|pg||
nt|hedyg: slam is down on A@d and @d|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: only alert|pg||
nt|hedyg: they are right, only explain if asked|pg||
nt|ronpa: Bar might try 3@H now and padon will accept with 4@D, this might lead to slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: multi  wk in one major |pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@h would be the best contract normally|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@H and 3N makes EW with a few correct guesses|pg||
nt|mariner1: Q@H and Q@S right, along with the Aces|pg||
nt|waso: 5c=|pg||
nt|syl: why -1|pg||
nt|waso: 6c|pg||
nt|waso: 6c -1   |pg||
nt|waso: 5c=|pg||
nt|syl: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: srry Bar is thinking not Cicek|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bar= Tarnovski|pg||
nt|arigun: @d lead will not be too difficult|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kaapo: 6@D on board 3 has was bid 5 times out of 20|pg||
nt|poohbear: u mean 3@h?|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think thats ok|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: OR playing same contract previous board|pg||
nt|sybarra: is S thinking of a splinter?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure about 4@D - reckon that should show the ace|pg||
nt|ronpa: 4@D just says I accept invitation and have a good hand|pg||
nt|ronpa: he will bid 3@S with min and 4@S is medium hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of a funky multi |pg||
nt|mdgraham: good defence is to play double as 13-15 approx or any 20+|pg||
nt|sybarra: S hand is really a bunch of junk |pg||
nt|mikael_w: 5@c seems to be a decent contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: 3NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: will see|pg||
nt|waso: i dont believe east will pass|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ..|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 4H?|pg||
nt|waso: east will play the hand  5c  or 6c  |pg||
nt|syl: what about 5@C in 1. seat|pg||
nt|kaapo: *was bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: J@C was found? Adrian|pg||
nt|mdgraham: kind of Last Train, then|pg||
nt|hedyg: Ozturk woke up|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no diamond lead now...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bit late for that, really|pg||
nt|ronpa: this hand is super maximum, also Q@H looks good after 3@H bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure @d lead still|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: I believe Ruso should bid to define her hand once partner responds. I would bid 2@c'|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: she bid 3diam|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: not good|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 5clubs in 1st seat|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe without the ace of diam|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2 pairs collected 1100 defending against 2@HX|pg||
nt|kastan88: occasionally West @D was 32, so was difficult to East assume, that partner 2 is from doubleton, probably Jxx|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D shows 5+ cards (if bal 12-14) or 4+ unbal in their system|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then North can get into the act and SOuht won't have this guess as to whether to re-open or not|pg||
nt|gulyas: any gazilli experts in the audience? I was asked what you do with 5@S-4@C wk (my guess was 2@D showing either minor)|pg||
nt|capercliff: both contract have bad breaks|pg||
nt|mikael_w: but whith this layout in @c it will be tough offcurse|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: OK:)|pg||
nt|mildredb: probably 7 back now|pg||
nt|hedyg: S is on lead|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep but ruff?|pg||
nt|ronpa: other table bid the slam and @D was led so chance for another big pickup for Israel|pg||
nt|ritong: poor sikora must be muttering some black polish just now|pg||
nt|henryb: At the other table the Norwegian pair managed to go 3 down in 6@h|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphztr: me too:)|pg||
nt|ozgull: þehmus ile güney tahmin ediyorum þu anda çok moralliler|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D for me is an underbid but it works out well here|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3N of course is rigid|pg||
nt|henryb: sorry, the dutch pair.|pg||
nt|ritong: we had translated:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe its a mistake or a lie from operator:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphztr: but she lead a club|pg||
nt|syl: @d trap may avoided.|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hanna gabor thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I think she dont like 3sp bid|pg||
nt|syl: 3@H rebid would have been the simplest|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep she have right hand on the head|pg||
nt|yuval10: making 10 tricks in @s is a lot...|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h looks like going down|pg||
nt|yuval10: N has to play @d after he wins the first @s|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: too many conventional bidding for Sweden ... I think...|pg||
nt|ritong: how so, "wk"?|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, 12-14, say|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 11-14, I s'pose|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is probably not the first time W has played in his singleton trump suit in hand |pg||
nt|mikael_w: ohh my, the result from OR will not be easy to match here|pg||
nt|capercliff: duck a @s and W is dead|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mariner1: well W must not have realized the 2@S was a game try here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bazý çiftler kontrdan sonraki koz tutuþlarýný göstermek için transferli deklareler oynuyorlar|pg||
nt|eerbil: Arda'nýn kontrdan sonra eðer transfer oynuyorlarsa iyi kör yükseltmesi anlamýnda 2@d demesi daha iyi olurdu|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: aie|pg||
nt|syl: 5@C NOW|pg||
nt|gracelin: with those weak spots, I would not be interested to penalize opponents in 2D, so would Cue 3D instead.|pg||
nt|kaapo: However, all tabes should find a slam here|pg||
nt|kaapo: North would now like to ask for aces outside of spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully landing in a safe 4 @H now |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Never mind, 4@CX lol|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: srry was my mistake:(|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 3 NT DBL|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hello, I am Ragavan from chennai of India |pg||

nt|vugraphztr: !|pg||
nt|MolvaM: muhtemelen arda ciçek bu konv oynamýyor|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes|pg||
nt|tomi2: my partner will never play me for support and 3 aces, maybe he will even pass 2@D|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not the best dession from N. Will cost some IMPs|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: let's see|pg||
nt|capercliff: E will double this|pg||
nt|capercliff: and S might just pull to 5@c|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, W is dead, nut not easy to find 10 tricks anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: so better not cash the @d K now, although i find it very difficult|pg||

nt|gulyas: OK, I am told 2@C is EITHER 16+, or natural|pg||

nt|yuval10: S must know that E has 2@c's|pg||

pc|cA|mc|9|nt|gulyas: so you rebid 2@C with a wk 54, then bid 2@S over 2@D to show the wk hand type|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@c ambiguous is gazzilli, and is the reason i moderately appreciate it, since it is not that easy to handle|pg||

nt|lestergold: Well of course delighted for an opportunity to comment here young Mr. Jones Beejing meddalist I do believe|pg||
nt|poohbear: it is possible that West might dbl 2@s but knowing partner is balanced that suggest otherwise|pg||

nt|kastan88: Running scores for Open class: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=8&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice club suits being dealt today |pg||
nt|andy_h: Conflicting factors now with N's hand|pg||
nt|Gerben42: this hand is tricky in 2/1, you have to decide if this is GF or inv. before seeing partners 2@D rebid|pg||
nt|andy_h: Positives: Good 5card suit, QT9 (good) support and a singleton.  Negatives: Singleton King and only 3 trumps|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would bid some kind of systematic bid that does not allow my partner to pass before game is reached and try to show my hearts too|pg||
nt|Gerben42: you mean 2@H :)|pg||
nt|henryb: will tell you shortly|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|tomi2: so I start with 2@H and bid 4@S later|pg||
nt|yuval10: costs 2 imps.... +7 instead +9|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: looks like some excitement|pg||
nt|raghavan: a slam hand - let us enjoy how they reach slam and make|pg||
nt|babydolldk: Nice slam with A @H onside|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h is normal here but the breaks are really cruel|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@S best NS spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: bery rare to see a passed out board in youth eent.  They get matured|pg||
nt|gracelin: very|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps NS bid another 3NT here?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Although it might not be that great on a @C lead|pg||
nt|ritong: quiet auction|pg||
nt|ritong: 3NT has play, to say the least|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gulyas: well, we know the basics|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mariner1: 1@C is Polish @c|pg||
nt|lestergold: only making game for n/s 4s tho 5dims can be let thru|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maçlar 20 boardluk|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1D probably showed H, and 2H confirmed 4-card support|pg||
nt|gracelin: With half his honors in opponents' suit, south better contend with 3H or a try|pg||
nt|kastan88: after 1@S vuln from West, how many points in @S will put North into partner's hand?|pg||
nt|tomi2: now south solved noth's problem :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: will someone crack this one?|pg||
nt|capercliff: E/W can make 5@d here double dummy|pg||
pc|c5|nt|charles_l: W maybe should bid 3@c over XX?|pg||
nt|babydolldk: Unless you lead a @H 6@D is only 1100 v. 1370:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: This is a forcing Pass by E|pg||
nt|ozgull: bu arada girls romanya ya karþý 30 - 5 önde|pg||
nt|rodal f: If N was active now|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if 2NT could be GF also, seems like 4@S kills a lot of space|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, south has a decent hand if partner wants to investigate slam|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think 2C may be either natural or a balanced GF|pg||
nt|kastan88: test time now: what is meaning of pass over 2@S doubled|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: well south having shown his spades first presumably this will be played in spades now|pg||
nt|eerbil: sanýrsam bu elden kaybedeceðiz|pg||

nt|begse: sanslý bi slem |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT too much if they open this light|pg||
nt|ronpa: 3NT and 3@D both can be defeated|pg||
pc|hT|nt|begse: gitmemek hatta 5 e cýkmamak lazým|pg||
nt|syl: wrong sided so|pg||
nt|syl: may even fail|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 1NT from Aurelie!!!:)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Board 6 is at the moment recorded as round pass in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: a director asked to look at my movie and went to check|pg||
nt|kaapo: That shuold be fixed soon, when they actually play the board|pg||
nt|Walddk4: On a diamond lead you can make it on cross-ruff, but it requires that you cash clubs first. So you need clubs to break|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you play a second diamond like declarer did in the other room, South will pitch a club and you go down|pg||
nt|yuval10: def. will play trumps after Q@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: and then after 2nd @d S can ruff and play trumps again|pg||
nt|yuval10: will it matters?|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@Hx was t/o, and the rest is automatic:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: cant argue with the bidding |pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: nope|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh well, also missed the 4@S, tough hand to land right|pg||
nt|mariner1: I guess 5@S can make too though|pg||
nt|lestergold: after 4d it wa surely correct fopr north to give preference to spades he had al reay bid the pips off a 6 card heart suit with poor intermediates|pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure that is possible either|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a lost opportunity for a swing here unless north 'corrects' to spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe 2 clubs is checkback|pg||
nt|kastan88: and that's it, if partner not having any points in spades, where are his 12 points for opening?, still could ask for aces, IMO|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Lauks and the two aces from his hand:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and he said: one down will be enough|pg||
nt|rodal f: Should become a flat board by normal defence|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|capercliff: and 4@h is very close as well with @h 3-3|pg||
nt|capercliff: actually the same 11 tricks are available in both suits|pg||
nt|mikael_w: the problem is that in 4@h you have NO entry to dummy|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room S bid @S twice and they still did not get to 4@S|pg||
nt|gracelin: a spade lead, club shift and duck, will beat even 3H|pg||
nt|kastan88: here is clear, that NS  have not the same pinion about pass over 2@S doubled from South hand. But such situations need to agree exactly. showing this 1 stopper or half stopper or ...|pg||
nt|kastan88: nothin in spades, or just minimum hand whatever, but agreement needed|pg||
pc|s5|nt|charles_l: its pretty much 16+ with @c, what he has|pg||
nt|gracelin: This maximum defense is in fact a reasonable one|pg||
nt|kaapo: On this lead, EW could keep South out of his hand|pg||
nt|kastan88: sr for mistyping. opinion , not pinion :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: with trumps 4-1, he cannot get his @Ds good and enjoy them too|pg||
nt|gulyas: in the meantime, Hungarian schoolkids are running riot against France (41-0 so far), and leading the pack! Making me very proud:)|pg||
nt|ritong: are you coaching them, daniel?|pg||
nt|gulyas: no, just rooting for them:)|pg||
nt|ritong: oki:)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|charles_l: (assuming polish @c)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Not much excitement - only they have not reached a makeable C slam|pg||
nt|mariner1: a none @c lead allows a make|pg||
nt|mariner1: non|pg||
nt|lestergold: now Jones ha to find the killing club lead |pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@s will not fare well\|pg||
nt|kaapo: But @Hs are splitting, too|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphztr: interesting|pg||
nt|mikael_w: play the @dK from hand is a little to much double dummy I think|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lestergold: and he has|pg||
nt|poohbear: even with that lead not much declarer can do to avoid going 2 off|pg||
nt|poohbear: Best to win in Dummy and play a @c to try to negotiate a ruff|pg||
nt|poohbear: alternatively if you trust the lead you can draw trumps and if 3-2 play for 4 @d tricks and then lead a @c off dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Brian Senior is here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: making pictures|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: this is a jr event!|pg||
nt|poohbear: not a senior moment :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might gain some IMPs again for Russia. @H lead? Seemed normal for me!|pg||
nt|ronpa: other room in 3@H which is also a tough contract|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yuval10: i guess not, as you take 6@h, 3@c, 1@d|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: well all the other uits have been bid naturally|pg||
nt|lestergold: falase card will not fool ed|pg||
nt|Gerben42: apparently 2NT cannot be a "good GF"|pg||
nt|yuval10: S would've done better to let N takes the trick and play Q@d|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Sandra is thinking|pg||
nt|yuval10: take in dummy, @c to J, ruff @s....etc|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: is not easy...|pg||

nt|tomi2: he actually does not need much more then norths hand to have a good @D slam for example|pg||

nt|gracelin: yes, need to duck the spade opening lead and made some good guessing later|pg||

nt|Gerben42: note that on a @C lead, @CAK, south will be squeezed in the red suits to make 11|pg||

nt|eerbil: bu kadar agresif bir atak için bir sebep göremiyorum bu elde|pg||
nt|kastan88: EW using I aasume polish Club based system, tho 1@C is 11...14 bal or all hands 18+|pg||
nt|kastan88: 'assume|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: right|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: According to the EW cc, 2@S is indeed a 5+M4+m|pg||
pc|s6|nt|MolvaM: açýktan 3 imp verip ataðý geri almak mümkün olabilmeli bence|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C was forcing with clubs, since he is GF he chose to show clubs instead of hearts to establish the force|pg||
nt|tomi2: so they were in a forcing situation and double by Sikora is a suggestion to play there|pg||
nt|gracelin: I like that|pg||
nt|gracelin: looks like -2 here|pg||
nt|capercliff: both tables opened 1N, not my cup of tea|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: unfortunately,  "style" points dont count on the imp scale |pg||
nt|sybarra: but Poland won big on the bd|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Manno just called the TD|pg||
nt|sybarra: for last bd?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: He was pointing at the lower left of the cc, the TD just took him away|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: They were whispering, couldn't hear|pg||
mb|3C|nt|waso: they led A H  and heart|pg||

nt|ritong: 3@h  wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: transfer or? |pg||

mb|3N|nt|andy_h: And again, bad breaks for whoever the declarer is |pg||
nt|tomi2: Toke Hoffmeister just turned 17 I was told|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: That's double pool right there o.O|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and after that 1 NT it might be tough|pg||
nt|capercliff: depends what defensive tricks they cash|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: so a chance for Greece to pull it back to close|pg||
nt|sybarra: aha|pg||
nt|gulyas: if NS plays strong @C|pg||
nt|ritong: a good move, though|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: NE writing now|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @h sort of put sand in the works |pg||
nt|ritong: 3NT has low chances, needs to drop @c K|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: TD examining the notes|pg||
nt|santyclz: On the other hand, it's the type of auction that usually warrents a trump lead.|pg||
nt|capercliff: if E wins a @c with the Q might be easier|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I agree, If N is playing 4@s there is a natural trumpg lead from E|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: this contract depends basically on which hand the hearts are played from|pg||
nt|lestergold: the natural play of a heart up to the KQ loses of course|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D sets up GF with 5+@D|pg||

nt|rodal f: Hard to come online no.|pg||

nt|kaapo: 1@C was forcing, either Polish or Precision - we aren't quite sure - and 1@D some negative reply|pg||
nt|gh1: not so good 4s, but maybee not x|pg||
nt|rodal f: An X will cost at the 4|pg||
nt|Gerben42: even 3N making is 17 imps|pg||
nt|capercliff: if West can win a trick with the K@c before trumps are tackled, indeed he will get the finesse wrong|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: i mean who is going to play a heart tghe other way then losing the chance of finessing against the tenof hearts if th hearts break 4/1 the other way|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3 nt with lots of chances after the @c lead and the king wins|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@S is either a 4 dard suit, or a hand like this missing a @H stopper or strong (18+) with spades|pg||
nt|gracelin: they found their best contract.|pg||
nt|kastan88: NS play some 5-card Majors, better minors, (14)15-17 NT|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ..|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thinking...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and me sleeping:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: this is too fast 4 me:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am told by specs that 1@C is either 15+ with @Cs, or 15-17 BAL, or 24+ any hand|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphztr: let's see|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no 5 diam or clubs ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: so they chose to play 4@S, this does not need hearts to break 4-3 but has some other dangers|pg||
nt|kaapo: This lead presents a trick|pg||
pc|d2|nt|babydolldk: On board 7 they bid 6@C|pg||
nt|raghavan: But if 2D is both Majors - the hand must be a real opening hand - or else difficult for respondaseer to judge - as in this c|pg||
nt|davidb: should misgueese all to go down|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H is cold on any lead|pg||
nt|kaapo: And also an entry to the North hand, unless East playes low, as he did|pg||
nt|yuval10: a slight overbidding by NS here...|pg||
nt|yuval10: N probably thought S has more for his X and 2@h|pg||
nt|yuval10: but the lucky position in the @c suit might enable it through|pg||
nt|ronpa: a @D lead might make declarer some troubles this lead will make it easy |pg||
nt|poohbear: easy?|pg||
nt|ronpa: (*er) ::)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure why N would play for the drop, 4 @S safer|pg||
nt|gulyas: there, they got to the top spot after all|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Screen opened and closed again|pg||
nt|ritong: ok, if 1@c can t be garbage, then 3@h is much more justified|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Manno was pointing at the part where it says what EW agreements are over strong artificial openings|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, now they have reatch the 4@s, rhis will be intresting|pg||
pc|s2|nt|poohbear: maybe best to win the @c and return a @c immediately|pg||
nt|tomi2: 17 IMPs for Germany if they make and 19 if not, so the whole play is like fighting for overticks|pg||
nt|Gerben42: just got confirmation Tomi, just turned 17|pg||
nt|capercliff: not the best lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: W will likely be presumed to have the @ck from no @c honor lead.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: There the Norwegians where lucky. Decerved? My viue NO|pg||
nt|usla: a dbl cost Norway 5imp, now not dbl cost Russia 9|pg||
nt|capercliff: now its trivial|pg||
pc|sA|nt|MolvaM: bu elde bizimkilerin 3ntye rahat gitmelerini bekliyoruz|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice leads by W , declarer might need to finesse @c right away|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: TD told Sikora to keep the notes for her, and told the players to resume play|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: fly it!|pg||
nt|frusco: now can take ace|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|lestergold: i predict a push|pg||
nt|gracelin: only 5-1 trump or 5-0 diamonds can cause troubles|pg||
nt|poohbear: off to a good start. |pg||
nt|ronpa: other table is in 2NT so a chance for big swing|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer carefully ducks a@h into the safe hand|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|raghavan: in this case|pg||
nt|MolvaM: böylece þlemi telafi etmiþ oluruz|pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
nt|gulyas: no overtrick now|pg||
nt|frusco: fear of west ruff|pg||
nt|frusco: after bid 2@h|pg||
nt|henryb: 3N would not occur to me with South. I would want to five partner a chance to show a sixth heart or three spades|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|Gerben42: doesnt look like making from here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @D are high but stuck in the unreachable south hand|pg||
nt|minnie lee: he needs to finesse to the @c9|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: he was lucky no 9 or 10@H in S|pg||
nt|ronpa: he still has to guess at the end who has the K@D, can try to endplay south with the clubs and K@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: since N did not play back a @c he has none|pg||
nt|poohbear: so no declarer can cash majors and in the end exit a @s . He will make the hand as long as North has 1 @d honor|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|lestergold: now the losing heart play|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
nt|yuval10: will have 2 entries for it with the K@d and the @s ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: good defence |pg||
nt|yuval10: he presumably knows that @s's are 4-3 from the bidding|pg||
nt|capercliff: I cant believe E underled the A@d here, Is this true?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yes|pg||
pc|sT|nt|davidb: now 5 |pg||

pc|c9|pc|c6|nt|MolvaM: zonda olmadýðý için sadece 6 puan ama olsun|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: Never mind that Gerben :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: so claim |pg||
nt|frusco: but risk if A@d in Est|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe we are resulting,  but seems to me take club ace and draw trump is safer |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: The problem appears to be that the cc doesn't show what 2@H meant|pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult position - would look silly if the @CA got ruffed |pg||
nt|sybarra: hmm Mike .....that would be yuckky |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: NS are offered time now, to agree upon a defense against overcalls not listed on the cc|pg||

nt|lestergold: simply unlucky thats all|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H looks right here|pg||
nt|gracelin: In a bidding challenge they will surely get the top mark by choosing 4S|pg||
nt|tomi2: in fact 3nt will make most of the times, because hearts can also split badly but block or ... if you bid 3nt fast they might lead something else, say the leader has Kx in hearts ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: and partner AQxxx|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, but after heart weakness exposed, I like Sikora's choice|pg||
nt|tomi2: sure|pg||
nt|tomi2: will we ever play board 10? that was an interesting one|pg||
nt|gracelin: a good result for Norway in the closed room|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ah... we'll just have to wait then|pg||
nt|kaapo: At the other table, the Latvian West led the singleton @D8 against 4@S on  7|pg||
nt|kaapo: His partner won with @DQ - but the 8 was difficult to read|pg||
nt|kaapo: So instead of taking the ace and giving a ruff, he shifted to hearts and the declarer has a chance|pg||

nt|kaapo: You can find running score by clicking on "RUNNING SCORES: Juniors"|pg||
nt|kaapo: And unless you have noted, you can find scores from a certain match by clicking on the table number in the running scores|pg||
nt|kaapo: For instance click on Tbl 7 for this match|pg||
nt|kaapo: Our operator was needed elsewhere - thus the break|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hopefully we'll soon be able to get back to business|pg||
nt|kaapo: EW are likely to play some number of NT on this board|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps 2NT, if West opens a 14-16 1NT and East invites|pg||
nt|kaapo: And it might just about make 8 tricks|pg||
nt|kaapo: Someone with inside information makes a guess, that East would not invite|pg||
nt|kaapo: Rather bid 3NT straight away|pg||
nt|kaapo: That might be possible, with AKK and T9|pg||
nt|kaapo: If EW indeed play 14-16 NT when vulnerable, the East hand may be a little difficult|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: Table has gotten three minutes extra for play|pg||

nt|mikael_w: well, I think N played a little fast there, Now she needed @h ro be 3-3 right ?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra2: seemed to work |pg||
nt|sybarra2: note on bd 7 e/w were cold for 3 nt |pg||
nt|sybarra2: a bit of overbidding there also|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: The 1100 board cost 15 IMPs|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: The other day as in 3 months ago :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has no choice Ron!|pg||
nt|ritong: have a flute, sweetie?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: has to be cared to not give up a @D ruff|pg||
nt|mariner1: though it would probably be with the winning @H trick anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: I think NS rest in 2@s on this one|pg||
nt|poohbear: EW can make 4@d though|pg||
nt|ritong: hello all|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Henri :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hi|pg||
nt|hedyg: difficult, double doesnt start to show the hand in N|pg||
nt|hedyg: any other bid is an overbid though|pg||
nt|gracelin: but maybe good only for 1 imp|pg||
nt|andy_h: Good to know these kind of scores still exist lol|pg||
nt|tomi2: had a -2000 in Beijing playing the Individual there with a Dutch partner|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: It's got a 2, 4 numbers and 2 0's!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what's the time limit for the twenty boards, Bas?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 2 hours 50 minutes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: should be more than ample |pg||

nt|capercliff: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: so, i tend to sdecond marion s pragmatism|pg||
mb|d|nt|poohbear: but how do they get in?|pg||

mb|2H|nt|MolvaM: kötü daðýlým, az puan kötü koz|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: puppet . S shows 2-3 in M's|pg||
nt|davidb: exactly 2sp &3h |pg||
nt|poohbear: unless Ruso bravely balances here|pg||
nt|syl: the OLD 1444!|pg||
nt|andy_h: Maybe there's a pattern? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: I guess Osipov is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Curious as to who your p was, Thomas :P|pg||
nt|henryb: but if I bid 3@d and then 3N over 3@h it lets partner do a little more. 3N is always so terminal|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ronpa: he has, it might be a bad one but it is :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 8 minutes a board|pg||
nt|capercliff: I cant see when the underlead would ever be right when S shows so many major suit cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: just what Grosset did not want to hear|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sayýn yorumcular? yorumunuzu rica etsek?|pg||
nt|kastan88: 11...14 bal or 441@D4 or (16)17+ unbal, 18+ balanced seems they play|pg||
nt|tomi2: this was even in vugraph, but my luck was, that it was middle of the night for the rest of the world so nobody saw this|pg||

nt|Gerben42: this site is useful for finding a contract for a score|pg||
nt|Gerben42: http://www.rpbridge.net/cgi-bin/xrf1.pl|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Nice double by Delle Cave, showing extras without four spades|pg||
nt|ronpa: if south started with KJx @D's with the clubs the only making play is to endplay him in clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: with singleton Q@d in his hand he has a choice?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Catalin, Do you know what 1 NT is for E/W ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Charles then here S bidding game is not correct - Since points are equal & both majors with NS, S can pass |pg||
nt|davidb: duck is best |pg||
nt|poohbear: another competitive victory for the Russians|pg||
nt|gracelin: Guess East has shown his pattern and West will cjoose 5C|pg||
nt|gracelin: choose|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: W is again with his head on the table |pg||
nt|gracelin: he might try 3H first to solicite a singleton honor raise|pg||
nt|sybarra2: bd 9 3@H NS in closed|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: This is probably making (possible over)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: note that 2000 is also 5@Hxx+2|pg||
nt|tomi2: I won't tell, but maybe you can ask Tim Verbeek, he knows maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Haha, will do|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Usually with screens|pg||
nt|lokaty: 1@H = 3-4 @H 11-14 or 18-195+@H|pg||
nt|mikael_w: the opening 1 NT that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|ronpa: after discarding 9@D he denied this option|pg||
nt|poohbear: only losing option was playing the @d Q|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 1.5 hours left|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: They're right on schedule|pg||
nt|gulyas: N has a typical t/o double here|pg||
nt|ritong: agree|pg||
pc|hK|nt|charles_l: of course S should have picked 2@s|pg||
nt|charles_l: E will pull i think|pg||
nt|babydolldk: 3@HD could be fun.... 9:)|pg||
nt|charles_l: his hand is quite useless except for @ss|pg||

nt|begse: genclik durumu|pg||
nt|begse: bizimki de yaslýlýk|pg||

nt|ritong: that s not untrue, my point was " you won t learn that more if you try to"|pg||
nt|henryb: 5@c would be a better contract|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=17&qshowflag=1|pg||

nt|lestergold: well this hand will play itself as the cards lie|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 10 trcks|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@H could easily be better than 5@C in case partner brings you @HQ instead of one of the club honors, but I like the 5@C bid|pg||
nt|andy_h: 1@S? These guys playing transfer responses in competition?|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@S = i have points but no 4 spades|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Dbl = I have 4 or 5 @S|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: TD just made the halftime call, we're half a board late|pg||
nt|tomi2: since 1@C did not show anything about minors they need 5 cards in both to bid a non forcing 2@C or 2@D|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok, ty|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|babydolldk: D must ask for other lead or what do you think?|pg||

nt|yuval10: 3@d even|pg||
nt|gulyas: this should make|pg||
nt|ritong: notice that 1@s was a winning shot when 2@s went off next door|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and then click on scholls or juniors|pg||

nt|hedyg: now @H|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Bethers ask thi p: this is a bad suit or a good suit p:)|pg||

nt|mdgraham: no, he has passed.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: unless west triues a diamond now |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes even if S gets a @D ruff declarer will cash A@H next|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: N taking a long time thinking...|pg||
nt|charles_l: Q and @d to kill the entry|pg||
nt|raghavan: East asked his partner to transfer to Spade. West should do so. He can bid 3Nt with a fit in Spades AXX.|pg||

nt|MolvaM: ingiltere kaptaný maçtan sonra soyunma odasýnda baðýracak. rua 2liden rua omuzlamak yasak diye|pg||

nt|hedyg: 3NT in OR was -3|pg||
nt|hedyg: lead was 4th best @s|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gracelin: just 1 imp as I have predicted|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphztr: club?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no...|pg||
nt|ritong: manno has a good idea about hands now|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ritong: the @c shift probably comes from 4 cards when dummy has 4 of them|pg||
nt|ritong: declarer tries to cater with @sHx anywhere, looks ok|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|charles_l: now fairly clear @sA was single|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|MolvaM: bbosunu yeni açanlar için belirtelim. türk milli tk kaptaný ise milli oyuncularýmýzdan yusuf sohtorik|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kendisi þu an romanyada hem U26 hem de Kýzlar takýmýmýzýn kaptanlýðýný yapýyor|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ritong: so west is very likely to hold 4@ds|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Gerben42: poor choice in @D cards|pg||
nt|tomi2: Poland is also blitzing Romania, boath have +42 or 43 now |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Decl led from the wrong hand here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Leading @H9 from dummy|pg||
nt|Gerben42: accepted?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Yup, @D5 by N|pg||
nt|tomi2: same with France and Hungary, 4 teams leading the provisional ranking with 24 VP|pg||

nt|kastan88: upgraded 1@S opening may be not giving to NS find their game, esp after 1NT from East|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 3nt?|pg||
nt|andy_h: I'd remove to 2@S here if 2@C is conventional|pg||
nt|Walddk4: agreed|pg||
nt|hedyg: good to play kokish over 2@c openings|pg||
nt|ronpa: so another 11 imps for Israel |pg||
nt|frusco: no so difficult make 1 nt|pg||
nt|lokaty: there was an amazing 1NT of Franchi on the 2nd room in this board.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: optimistic 4@s|pg||

pc|c3|nt|hedyg: both N and S were passed hands, unlikely to balance on the 4 level|pg||
nt|hedyg: a wow lead by N|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C is conv, yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT as an opening bid can often be a slam-killer|pg||
pc|c6|nt|babydolldk: this should be down 1|pg||
nt|davidb: NS have a good save but EW  can make many hearts (6) |pg||
nt|davidb: 3NT was sp splinter|pg||
nt|lestergold: sogreece more ro less get it all back on this deal|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer has to guess which black finesse to take in 3nt but both work. Likely takes the one thru the overcaller|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kuzey bu kontru ceza niyetine attý ama güney bunu çözebilecek mi?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: maybe NS raise frequently on 3|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think in netherlands it is popular to raise 1@S on 3 cards|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, so youre less likely to find fit now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|raghavan: Ns have majority of points = South's 1NT +10 points with N normally should go down - |pg||
nt|mariner1: this might be a perfect Roland slam, 12.89 % that makes :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: (that % is a true guesstimate)|pg||
nt|waso: France avoided any trap  and bid 5d|pg||

nt|mdgraham: bidding 1NT on a 14-count sandwiched between two bidding opponents....well, you have to say there is a certain element of risk |pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: Morris in open room at equal vulnerabiklity went for an advance save when he should have downgraded his ten count to seven points with the position of the KH known to be under the ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: cosh|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs @S to be no worse than 3 5,,,, @H have to be 2 2 with K@H on side.....and @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: have to be right for only 1 loser|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nice 6Diam bid |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: my style:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I like to open with 6 diam with that hand:)|pg||

nt|poohbear: 5@ds needs both finesses|pg||
nt|MolvaM: evet|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@d = @d + major?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|charles_l: even ruff 3rd @c to @h up doesn't work - trump promo for def|pg||
nt|raghavan: No useful discards from East hand. |pg||
nt|charles_l: @hK seems wrong - where is @c loser going if not 3-3?|pg||
nt|ritong: might have worked finding opener with say @h Jxx and no @s loser, but, as any very marginal shot, this unlikely, so costs on the long run|pg||
pc|dA|nt|santyclz: Do they play 2-way Stayman?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|capercliff: and a pretty skimpy invite opposite 11-13|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|gracelin: 7c is a good proposition if West has Kxx of clubs instead|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C is alerted because they respond 2@C also on balanced hands even with spade fit, so it could be on 2 cards only|pg||
nt|gracelin: so only 4C confirmed the club fit|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2nt is forcing and 3@C confirms some support|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@C confirms the fit, 4@H is a cuebid|pg||
nt|tomi2: and i got a hint from on of their teammembers, that 4@S is blackwood for clubs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: Did I see 2@S first?|pg||
nt|tomi2: I have been informed that this partnership does not raise frequently on 3 cards, thx to Gerbrand (you're to old for schools now? sad:( )|pg||
pc|h5|nt|poohbear: well not quite both but something extra|pg||
nt|ritong: most likely, can t imagine a convention hiding majors|pg||
pc|d7|nt|poohbear: which finesse taken?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Adrian?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: he dont try |pg||
nt|poohbear: sorry 6@d tricks|pg||
nt|poohbear: cant count :P|pg||
nt|MolvaM: karoya devam?|pg||
nt|ozgull: ama boþlanýrsa yapar|pg||
nt|poohbear: Israel has been the hottest team over the last 5 matches. They got off to a weak start but are rapidly moving up the standings|pg||
nt|ronpa: declacrer started with low @C from hand to guard against @C's 4-0 on his right but all the ways leads to 12 tricks|pg||

nt|tomi2: 4nt = 1 or 4 keycards in clubs|pg||
nt|gracelin: seems right, that 4S didn't like a cue bid :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: so if West could show 2 key-card with a 5D reply, East would bid 7C|pg||

mb|1D|mb|d|nt|scotty: So therefore you are saying that the 4th seat preempt denies shortness|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome michael|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm not saying that, Michael ... I say it shows some light opening bid with a good suit.|pg||
nt|robinswr: no 4th seat preempts say that you think you have plays for game but not for slam|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4D!|nt|scotty: right , but since you think partner needs to know which values are important, it must mean that you deny singleton or void|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|robinswr: when in doubt, vulnerable, bid game and let them try to beat you. I tought that to meckwell which is why they are winning |pg||
nt|marlowepi: sounds logical|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|scotty: Exactly - so the whole club-diamond-spade value thing is irrelevant|pg||
nt|kareno: Not my idea of a 2nt bid - two card diversity ... you'll end up in a 4-2 fit too often.|pg||
nt|robinswr: just a guess and how is partner supposed to know|pg||
nt|scotty: I play 4th seat preempt shows a 7-trick hand - but not seven solid|pg||
nt|robinswr: makes sense|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: n could have bid 1n to show minors also... but said he wanted to apply max pressure|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6H|nt|marlowepi: in other words, i think, about what N had.|pg||
nt|scotty: Didn't know you were responsible for Meckwell success - hope you're getting the royalties|pg||

nt|kaapo: Great|pg||
nt|kaapo: I won't have to start explaining about different NT ranges then :)|pg||

nt|sybarra2: taking small break here folks  not to worry |pg||

nt|sybarra: may be disappointed with that score|pg||
nt|gulyas: mad scramble? I call it the 'greedy algorythm':)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Look at the Hungary kids go! 25-5 against France!|pg||
nt|ritong: i love that one:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: they are so closed...|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|vugraphztr: yep wrong again from me|pg||

mb|d|nt|tomi2: this is a very nice board, difficult decisions to make for all players involved|pg||

mb|p|nt|poohbear: You specs arent paying attn . usually 20 people jump on me :P|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess the limits are 4S for NS and 5D for EW|pg||
nt|gracelin: but surely they will bid higher than that|pg||
nt|rodal f: U remember from own exsperiens? And ure still hard by ure biddings:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx all,   have fun!|pg||
nt|gulyas: bye Sherl|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Marion is thinking|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, naturally|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|davidb: 4spX is par in this board|pg||
nt|poohbear: North should bid 2@c only|pg||
nt|MolvaM: üçüncüden oyun açanda 13 kart bulunmasý yeterlidir konvansiyonu bu|pg||
nt|gracelin: as spec pointed out, even 4S maybe difficult for NS|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess south will not give up yet|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ah, 4@S 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@S can have longer @D|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@S is alerted because a) it can have longer @D and b) it can be on 3 cards sometimes|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT with 13 to 9 is never obvious|pg||
nt|ritong: the bid is problematic|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ritong: "whoa" she thinks|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Bob bid with his 3 of hearts:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I think they are friends:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: in my opinion|pg||
nt|poohbear: Lets see how they handle this|pg||
nt|poohbear: are they playing a Polish style system Adrian?|pg||
nt|poohbear: that would make 3@c the correct bid|pg||
nt|poohbear: since opener is limited by failure to open 1C|pg||
nt|sybarra2: sporting X by W :(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East is not being backward in coming forward here|pg||
nt|ritong: ya sure|pg||
nt|ritong: he really wants to take the cues away|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: lol, Mike "the cryptical" Graham :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: with all those goodies, West may bid 4@S |pg||
nt|frusco: after 3@s ovest must to bid 4|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Maybe Sikora thought it was "go ahead with a 5-4"|pg||
nt|frusco: west sry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can West be 3-2 in the majors?|pg||
nt|ritong: certainly so|pg||
nt|capercliff: N needs to do something here|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|sybarra2: not my cup of tea |pg||
mb|p!|nt|vugraphztr: sorry, the play had |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: gone on but i missed it. 3@h went down 1|pg||
nt|charles_l: np, ty|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ty|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Osipov said: 'nice fit' :)|pg||
nt|ritong: even 2/1 for that matter|pg||
nt|ritong: and the whoa is confirmed with a second cue|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|davidb: probably W knows his partners agressive jumps -if not 4sp is ok nv|pg||
nt|davidb: A h & h looks safe vs 3-2 in trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: and that would also make 3NT an easy bid by South|pg||
nt|ritong: this hand seems to be a matter of undertrick(s)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d a bit enthusiastic|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: holding 3 good spades and 2 bad hearts this system allows you to bid 1@S and partner rightside NT contract - but he can also find out later about your 3 cards if he has a strong ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am told NS play 2@c as balanced 18-19|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@s is cold obviously|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think both N and S shod do somerhing more here|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: Have to go nowm folks and leave u to this exciting encounter between these promising young bloods|pg||
nt|mariner1: ty Mike|pg||
nt|ritong: three down looks normal|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bessis bid a quiet 2@d in the OR and played there|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ingiltere takýmý 1@c açýp bir sürü þlem buluruz diye hazýrlanmýþ ama rahat býrakmýyor rakipler|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6@c sizce nasýl kontrat?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ah, I see we lost 2 board :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT was mini|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 2@D looks like a 2-way Stayman|pg||
nt|kaapo: Which is a gameforcing relay|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2NT denies 4c majors, and probably also denies 5-card minors|pg||
nt|kaapo: 3@S shows 5|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 3NT shows 2 @S|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C forced 2@D to show a sign off in @D or some stronger hands|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C forces 2@D, but maybe there is a case for bidding 2@H here, since so many @D fit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: A great result for Sweden |pg||
nt|yuval10: reasonable bidding, yes still a big swing in favour of Sweden|pg||
nt|yuval10: *yet|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and a nice recovery after 0-48 after 6 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: Grosset needs to unblock|pg||
nt|kaapo: This shows a draw back in 2-way Stayman|pg||
nt|kaapo: Since West hasn't got 4@H nor 5 cards in a minor...|pg||
nt|kaapo: And he has 2@S...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Wow, I wish I could pen X at the 1-level lol|pg||
nt|Gerben42: anyway, gotta go|pg||
nt|Gerben42: thanks all|pg||
nt|andy_h: See you later Gerben|pg||
nt|tomi2: ok, thx Gerben!|pg||

nt|hedyg: i bet Lorenzini is hurting|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nope|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: 3@H has some entry problems: you need 2 entries to dummy to take  finesses in @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: find the @cQ for 3N|pg||
nt|raghavan: breather given by defense|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3NT shouldnt be too difficult . Declarer prob just unblocks spades and ducks a @c|pg||
nt|poohbear: and falls back on the @d finesse if @cs dont break|pg||
nt|henryb: I would only have bid 2@h; but I am old|pg||
nt|ritong: with north hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|henryb: no, with S|pg||
nt|ritong: was an option, yes|pg||
nt|henryb: and the auction might continue 6@h by north|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: that s the way ahan ahan i like it|pg||
mb|4N|nt|lestergold: and thx Rob cu all  soon|pg||
nt|ritong: why would he?:)|pg||
nt|kaapo: We (and the defence) know his full shape: 2-3-4-4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Worst he cold get by an 2/1 I belive|pg||
nt|mikael_w: S Dbl only showed @d I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: a friendly lead|pg||

mb|6H|nt|poohbear: ok declarer sees things differently than me :)|pg||
nt|lokaty: I disagree with 4 @S. 3@S doesnt promise anything more then 2@D, his @C values arent impressive and they are not vulnerable.|pg||
nt|gulyas: the lead giving away a trick, but still not enough for declarer probably|pg||
nt|ritong: DID NOT EXPECT MORE|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: he is still ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: wonder if they have a specific agreement of what X of a transfer is, suspect not|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: If the @d finesse had lost declarer might have had a spot of trouble|pg||
nt|yuval10: 11 tricks now are likely|pg||
nt|yuval10: so 10 imps for Sweden|pg||
nt|ritong: meanwhile the poles tried an intricated auction on the board michielsen bid a bold 3NT, and they lost 10|pg||

nt|ritong: find the capslock, please:)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: well, this is not really hurting|pg||
nt|ritong: how so, 3@s does not promise more than 2@d?|pg||
nt|ritong: are we deprived of green cards?|pg||
nt|gulyas: now he only needs both @H honors onside, but that will not happen|pg||
nt|lokaty: its just obvious bid from the MP1s:)|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|mb|4H|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|robinswr: when there is a singleton in dummy, the normal signal is suit preferance |pg||

mb|d|nt|robinswr: yes|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: That is how most play it.|pg||
nt|scotty: I think most experts would lead a heart from the S hand - combining thought of major and not giving away trick or tempo|pg||
nt|kareno: Needs less from partner to help also.|pg||
nt|scotty: Against 1N-3n, you might find some spade leaders|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and most would bid with the S hand if nonvul i think|pg||
nt|robinswr: or some diamond leaders|pg||
nt|robinswr: good lead problem for 1nt 3nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|scotty: But if partner has nothing in the suit you lead, a spade might well turn out better, if E has both honors or W has Hx.  But I would lead a heart|pg||

nt|kastan88: sr, Sir Operator, I'll stop commanding :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can become a funny 3NT EW|pg||
nt|capercliff: but that would imply other hand types|pg||
nt|mikael_w: But now I wonder why S dosent open 1 NT ?|pg||
nt|henryb: friendly table|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|mdgraham: over 20 boards the better team should win. Not so over shorter matches |pg||
nt|mdgraham: but not guaranteed either|pg||
nt|capercliff: whatever X means, North had too much to pass twice|pg||
nt|mikael_w: oh, they play 15-17 I was told|pg||
nt|ritong: atta girl:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: NS may go down in a major suit slam with wrong (but reasonable)  guesses in both major suits|pg||
nt|kaapo: NS are close to making 4@S|pg||
nt|kaapo: But it should lose at least a spade, a diamond and 2 @Hs|pg||
nt|kastan88: 1@C= 11-14 bal or 441@D4 or 17+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|sybarra2: in comparison e/w will say:  we took the early save" |pg||
nt|rodal f: But will might end at a partscore in @D|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I'm not sure I like 3@D, got the HCP and distr, but the suit is lousy|pg||
nt|yuval10: can W fins the excellent @s lead? not likely, i'd say|pg||
nt|yuval10: *finds|pg||
nt|frusco: 5@d is unlucky|pg||

mb|3H|nt|poohbear: I guess the Russians are playing a Polish type system otherwise North really shouldnt pass 1H|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: my experience is that Dutch schools player are all very fast, so if you play average tempo you are "slow" :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Haha, I guess we do|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: we have a back and forth match going here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N a very reasonable spot|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C = Precision style, 2@S = hearts, 2NT natural i guess|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in Open Room are in a tough 3N here|pg||
nt|athene: i would think this is the sort of game you stumble into more often than not|pg||
nt|athene: east opens and west just decides to force to game|pg||
nt|athene: with the good heart suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes and it would be tough to bring 9 in I think|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: they play natural|pg||
nt|poohbear: works out very nicely for them here|pg||
nt|hedyg: is Lorenzini/Grosset a new partnership? i seem to rember Lorenzini used to play with another partner|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu 2 kör cevabu kör ataðýný önlemek bakýmýndan iyi|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C was likely strong (or Polish), and 1@D negative|pg||
nt|kaapo: South has some @S support and a hand that is pretty maximum for 1@D|pg||
nt|kaapo: So he might find another call|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Any time I play with my father, and I mess up, he says "Look at the clock, we've got another 8/30 minutes left! Take longer!"|pg||
nt|ritong: offshape preempts with unexpected strength often turn out good|pg||
nt|gulyas: now he needs to find the @S ruff to defeat this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: need to find the spade ruff now, and how can they realistically do that?|pg||

nt|hedyg: he is indeed, even if he misguessed the @ds here|pg||
nt|tomi2: E could have ducked the @CA but decl was favorite to get the clubs right anyway because of the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: France and Norway going strong at the top of the table. However, this is just round 12 of 22, so many things can happen|pg||
nt|yuval10: 8@c call for a @s return|pg||
pc|dA|nt|eerbil: Güney ilk trefli almasa defans biraz daha kolay olabilirdi|pg||
nt|sybarra2: never to see dummy again |pg||
pc|d4|nt|davidb: good bidding by EW . play should not be a problem|pg||
nt|poohbear: no reason to overruff when there is a loser to pitch|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes if you play both suit "with the odds" then you lose, but I think N did not bid his 5 cards in the OR, so E lead a heart and I guess W shoed his count|pg||
pc|d9|nt|poohbear: EW needed totake the @d ace before plying the @c|pg||
nt|syl: crossruffing may be superior|pg||

mc|9|nt|babydolldk: last chance|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: ms Hoderova again pondering her next move|pg||
nt|charles_l: no- too much for 1@d response i think|pg||

nt|marlowepi: yes, it should be as a passed hand facing a mere one-level overcall, i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: i would lead a heart also|pg||

nt|poohbear: this will likely be another Russian pickup|pg||

mb|d|nt|davidb: every card is ok for NS  for 11 tricks in H . |pg||
nt|poohbear: and Ozturk's as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: with the lucky @cs he should be able to make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: how about N bidding 5@C instead of 5@d, showing force in @c and fit in 1 of the reds?|pg||
nt|kaapo: In a diamond contract a major suit ruff would bring it to 12|pg||
nt|tomi2: in all junior competitions you have a bi difference between the best players and the "newcommers" Jassem and Tuczynski playing for Polish schools won that event already 2 years ago ...|pg||

nt|poohbear: South should reject|pg||
nt|ritong: declarer needs five @c tricks, he will find them whatever his choice so big hit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Montanari sees no defensive tricks vs 6@D.....|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he might bid 6@s|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nope|pg||
nt|eerbil: bu kadar öndeyken alýþveriþ ihtimali düþük eller gelmesi hoþ biþey|pg||
nt|capercliff: if KQ doubelton still has a chance later|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: N sure has a lot to be passing 3@D|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, particularly when he holds @sAK, his pard very likely has an 8 bagger|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=733&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1 for running scores in the Schools series|pg||
nt|tomi2: this looks like an interesting spot they have reached now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|raghavan: West will pass |pg||
nt|davidb: if N is short in Sp , S hand is not so good . ok to pass Nv'  |pg||
nt|hedyg: would have been -4|pg||
nt|hedyg: Grosset "the thinker" might take a while to play this|pg||
nt|ritong: he has no real alternative|pg||
nt|rodal f: Need @S returne for set the contract NOW|pg||
nt|henryb: suitable dummy|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: i am told they play Ghestem, so 2@s was @H+@C|pg||
nt|poohbear: trump switch best|pg||
nt|hedyg: time to play @c|pg||
nt|capercliff: and E would have to play a @s for ruff and discard anyway|pg||
pc|h2|nt|charles_l: if Z rebid 4@s it might go ppp...?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ms. Hoderova is playing the bartender now|pg||
nt|raghavan: N should try spade ruffs before drawing trumps |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: has left the table in order to procure drinks|pg||
nt|tomi2: west chose to pass 2@H - it's quite popular in Poland a) to upgrade lots of 14's to 1NT and b) to superaccept on maximum and 3 cards support - so he chose to pass 2@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2H is probably making.  Nice stop by Sikora |pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer will promote the 4th @s to discard a @c, and ruff @d in dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, West could have led a diamond against 3NT I suppose, but he chose his own suit, clubs. Not such a good idea|pg||
nt|ronpa: well played|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|santyclz: We'll save everyone's reputation and claim w shifted to a @d after winning the @ck...|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphztm: S thinking.......|pg||
nt|syl: bold bid this 3nt|pg||
nt|gracelin: unless declarer misguessed D after north ruffs club and return a low D.|pg||
nt|kaapo: North has only 3 hearts, so after (taking @H finesse and) ruffing a @H, EW can draw trumps and then raise the @S trick|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Bech explains to Lauks that his part's hand is a REALLY bad 13|pg||
nt|sybarra2: take no finesses.... |pg||
nt|tomi2: since W made no negative double E should have good spades for his offer to play 4@S. W with Hxx and @H shortnes can pass maybe|pg||
nt|mikael_w: As the layout is here this shod make|pg||
pc|d2|nt|poohbear: 3@h is a counter Game try|pg||
nt|poohbear: perhaps North should accept that|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@D was an artificial GF|pg||
nt|kaapo: And I suppose 3NT means what Florin told|pg||
nt|kaapo: This should go 1 down|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mariner1: @H lead helps declarer|pg||
nt|hedyg: that helps!|pg||
nt|sybarra2: bang down aces and kings  |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mariner1: probably always makes 5 though|pg||
nt|athene: south has bid north's hand for him here|pg||
nt|athene: north passed 3@D and then bid only 3@S over the second double|pg||
nt|athene: saying "I don't have anything, partner!"|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=5|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I could claim but who knows..:)|pg||

nt|hedyg: no operator claims :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Grosset is .... thinking:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ofc|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
pc|s3|nt|MolvaM: bu elde önemi yok ama kuzeyin pik 8li dönmesi iyi bir oyun|pg||
nt|gh1: now last chance fore spade|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think 4@S is better than 5@D, esp. on this @D layout|pg||
nt|tomi2: Hoffmeister has already bid 4@D, if he wanted to run out of 4@S maybe he should have offered 5@C to let partner decide the final contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps his p could've halped him by doubling 2@d|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=3&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|mariner1: -  Running Scores (Refresh Often)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Nice said Mr. Osipov|pg||
nt|ritong: isn t that some sort of masterminding, passing 2@s with 16?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphztm: bd.13 was fault|pg||
nt|gracelin: did C9 call for spade ?|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes but nopbody leads from Q into jx when xxx in spades is also available|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kaapo: I held a elementary bridge class a while back, and I kind of remember the book stating something about 33 HCPs for a slam|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kaapo: So perhaps Bech could've settled for 3NT|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra2: easy from here of course|pg||
nt|yuval10: which he didn't, according to the movie|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|ronpa: now another club|pg||
nt|poohbear: On a @c switch declarer wins and plays a @d. East can win but he has a dillema . If he cashes the spade that sets up a trick. If he doesnt  then it gets pitched|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, I guess he had to cash it|pg||
nt|poohbear: and declarer can set up a long heart|pg||
nt|hedyg: it was a question of cash or cash it|pg||
pc|sK|nt|poohbear: another trump now and declarer will attempt to cash 2@ds but the second gets ruffed. He can then ruff a @h and get the good Q of @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: played by S in OR on J@S lead|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and they played fast untill now|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|athene: south raised to 4@S, saying "don't lie, i know you have lots really!"|pg||
nt|athene: and south was indeed correct|pg||
nt|ritong: then " undo" "undo" "undo", "sorry" "sorry" "sorry" etc|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and apparently easy at the table:)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphztr: everyone's having a laugh|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c2|nt|gracelin: yes, there is no discard available for declarer, so north will just sit back with DQ|pg||
nt|poohbear: had East NOT cashed the spade and played a trump . Declarer would win in hand and cash a @d pitching a @s then play Ace of @h ruff a @h |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kaapo: Or pehaps he could bid somthing to suggest a minor suit contract, say 4NT or 5NT?|pg||
nt|tomi2: Rusch could also have 5 clubs and 4 spades for his bidding|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|vugraphztr: the cups are tiny|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: when a @c comes from W he can claim|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mikael_w: brb|pg||
nt|santyclz: Painful to see declarer suffering so when all lines work.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|vugraphztr: !!!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: one down ...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: OR 2 boards faster|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mariner1: now the @c loser is gone|pg||
mc|10|nt|tomi2: while North maybe could have doubled holding some 1.5 trump tricks and an ace and seeing they had problems in their auction, I think he will win more often then lose those 4 imps ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: for =|pg||
nt|ritong: well, maybe they have agreements about simple raises|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: Vincent taking the @D7 :)|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: Ernst just took a bathroom break|pg||
nt|gulyas: a decent slam, and it makes, too:)|pg||
nt|ritong: can t argue with success, anyway|pg||
nt|gulyas: lets see how they bid it|pg||
nt|lokaty: again polish club here|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d!|nt|mariner1: 1@C Polish @c|pg||
nt|poohbear: it was indeed 7 to Russia on the 1@h hand. NS played 3@c in the other room. That was 2 high|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, some players play cards very fast - some don't place their card clearly enough on the table (or the screen hides it)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 2@H seems to be the (in)famous Muiderberg, as we call it, 5@H, 4+m|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: amusing|pg||
nt|henryb: X = one suit or 4Major, longer minor?|pg||
nt|ritong: east almost has the best hand at the table after this start|pg||
nt|ritong: i would translate that with a pass|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|henryb: and you would be wrong as declarer takes 6 tricks while you have a cold 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: 1Nt opening 14-16 won the prevoious board|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D perhaps an underbid in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: five trumps and an ace...maybe worth 4@D|pg||
nt|athene: wld be nicer with two spades and the stiff in hearts, admittedly|pg||
nt|athene: (or that's what north probably thought) :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers asking for 6@D here|pg||
nt|kaapo: The South hand here seems to me at least as good as the one North opened 1@C on  13|pg||
nt|kaapo: Even though it has 1 HCP less.|pg||
nt|kaapo: Now, in a limited opening system...|pg||
nt|kaapo: South might have a was to show a maximum opening with 6@H and 3@S|pg||
nt|kaapo: Like 2NT|pg||
nt|kaapo: *way (instead of was)|pg||
nt|kaapo: This might be yet another case for 3NT with a good 6-card major|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: which probably he cant remember now as he is staring at the (very high) ceiling|pg||
nt|sybarra2: muiderberg or funky tartan?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 2NT asking which m|pg||
nt|ronpa: open room here bid quickly to 3NT defenced blocked clubs so only 2 off|pg||
nt|ronpa: *defence|pg||
nt|ritong: not a sure shot, but could turn out in a bloodbath|pg||
nt|henryb: South may run.|pg||
mb|r!|nt|ritong: anyway, grosset is " cricri" on BBO and i can say that he is a super nice guy|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|ronpa: will padon bid 4@C?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: or he will lead the ace of clubs?|pg||
nt|ronpa: he's not on lead so... :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he won't lead anything|pg||
nt|ritong: probably systemic|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3NT is on NS any lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: and now is the time to bid it|pg||
nt|gracelin: Now a lucky grand slam bid by Norway in open room|pg||
nt|othered1: we can see if it gets in the way of a constructive auction|pg||
nt|sybarra2: E pleased to hear it is @C |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 50 minutes left|pg||
nt|lokaty: 2@C natural GF, 2@D relay for majors|pg||
nt|ritong: @hs into the picture soon, then|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|charles_l: i think 4@h is a practical bid - not dbl|pg||
nt|poohbear: Ruso should lie by dbling if she feels obligated to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i would have opened a 20-21 2NT with the 2 10s and 9@d|pg||
nt|usla: matchpoints dbl in OR, saka style:)|pg||
nt|ronpa: he knows opp are bidding on long @D's|pg||
nt|santyclz: So our 2nd push of the match.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: looks like a standard 3 NT here, whith maybe 1 IMP to sweden|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sorunsuz|pg||
nt|tomi2: just getting some bets that polish players wont bid the grand, but my experience against sikora and nawrocki is that they will :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes this is a good time to grab a coffee|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mariner1: 2N shows the bid hand with little @c help as he has|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: !!|pg||
nt|poohbear: She rebid 3@h?|pg||
nt|poohbear: would think she would be thrilled to raise NT|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and now Mr. Osipov.... pass:)|pg||
nt|ritong: the fact that he takes his time playing this important event is rather a good thing, i add|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure it is|pg||
nt|ozgull: düz bir el daha|pg||
nt|tokay1975: bu elide cozduler pastan gelen ortaga  dbl muthis|pg||
nt|tokay1975: kesinlikle pas derdim ben alakam olmazdi|pg||
nt|kaapo: So 3@H now could either show exactly 3@S - or deny 3@S. South just doesn't know which :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit passive by E? 2@C as bid for anyone?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: shaka style= 5 clubs:)|pg||
nt|ritong: easy going|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: unless 4m=m+@h|pg||
nt|babydolldk: if you play leaping michaels maybe 4@C...|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt showed the strong version of 1@C? what wld south do with the weak NT? pass 2@C?|pg||
nt|gracelin: Sikora may still regret on  11 when they stopped in 6C but trump K was onside for seven.|pg||
nt|andy_h: Not much to this hand, with the diamonds breaking.|pg||
nt|andy_h: And of course N is going to lead his shortest major to hit partner's suit|pg||
mb|2H|nt|babydolldk: :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: good decision by N 4SX goes 2 down VUL -500 where as now only 450|pg||
nt|charles_l: between dbl & 4@h, guys?|pg||
nt|babydolldk: D|pg||
nt|mariner1: Q10 @D comes down so this will not take long|pg||
nt|kastan88: disaster in Open Roome here, after quite similar bidding as here, IMO North can't bid 3NT with only 1 stopper, double much solid decision,|pg||
nt|lokaty: from this hand 13 tricks propably.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok Cliff, I do that then|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: Sikora is a gabmler and Nawrocki not so when West has the final decision to make...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: good lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 7D makes on 2-2 diamonds or singleton Q, altgether about 52.5% chance|pg||
nt|kaapo: Although, of course they may not have that kind of agreement at alk|pg||
nt|ritong: no comment|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: This will not do well|pg||
nt|tomi2: 7@D always makes when Sikor is playing and Qxx(x) is not offside ;)|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am sure he won't go wrong here.  That's a safety bet.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: 4 @h = cue at this point |pg||
nt|sybarra2: (just a guess) |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Johansen just explained it as such|pg||
nt|othered1: Now has to find the @CQ.  Never got their good @S fit in, however.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|MolvaM: demek sen de yaþlýsýn tokay|pg||
nt|othered1: There goes the @C guess|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ok now found? |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|tokay1975: ole gozukuyo:))|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: e n-am fost atent|pg||
nt|gracelin: Nawrocki adopted the scientfic approach by asking trump Q|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mariner1: yes he would have to as 2@C was not forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: now claim 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: now you can shorten matters cricri|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: only 7 looser|pg||
nt|ritong: east is the probable declarer, dude  you can wait til the board is over to say " heyy i ve got some @s values"|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 100  sayi yazar giderdik biz|pg||
nt|gracelin: thedenial|pg||
nt|andy_h: W will duck a heart, in the (off?) chance that S has preempted with 7 of them and diamonds don't break - then he can take finesses into the non-danger hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|MolvaM: son 5 borda giriyoruz|pg||
nt|kastan88: Now South had to decide to leave 3@S doubled or look for minor contract (that he mentioned with good-bad 2NT)...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I think is not a classical good / bad NT|pg||
nt|lokaty: :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kastan88: yes, but similar their|pg||
nt|kastan88: *there|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: just claim the reds :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty !|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: he claim too|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg: i must say i am very impressed in general with the quality played by all these juniors|pg||
nt|hedyg: junior bridge nowadays is good!|pg||
nt|tomi2: hmm lost my bet :(|pg||
nt|tomi2: but sikora will find the @DQ anyway so i was kind of right|pg||
nt|gracelin: Sikora can't be sure that partner has four trumps, otherwise he knows the only problem was trump Q and he would find it.|pg||
nt|kaapo: Spade loser goes on a @D so this is as good as 3NT as it is|pg||
nt|sybarra2: who leads from qxx?  or x of @C on this auction |pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphztr: they are thinking and I'm sleeping (a little bit) :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|gulyas: maybe he wants a sacrifice, the vuln is just right for that:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gulyas: after he told himself what to lead, he doesn't|pg||
nt|ritong: pity|pg||
nt|gulyas: so its a push|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|charles_l: if i D then 4@h i expect W to move with @sA and @hQ10x|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kastan88: good play from West here, he must put declarer under pressure at once, another way dias will be thrown on good hearts|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit more aktivity at the other room so X came natural|pg||
nt|ronpa: same block here and now declarer has to decide -1 or -4|pg||
pc|cK|nt|usla: after 3 @C pre W hand count what tricks?|pg||
nt|rodal f: U can ask:) Was a hard one|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: so % clubs better over 1spade?:):)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: '5 clubs'|pg||
nt|ronpa: *-2 or -4|pg||
pc|c4|nt|poohbear: 3 NT would have depended on North's choice of leads|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: when his partner doesn't raise spades, and opps go for 3nt, west knows there's no future in spades|pg||
nt|athene: hence the heart lead|pg||
mc|10|nt|mdgraham: The @C10 surely showed the @C9, so East could have overtaken  |pg||

nt|mariner1: 2@D shows a major suit here|pg||
nt|hedyg: i believe it better nowadays than it used be say 20 or 30 years ago|pg||
nt|ritong: mm..|pg||
nt|hedyg: remembering your junior days Henri?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: at this table they play a very good and NATURAL bridge|pg||
nt|ritong: somewhat|pg||
nt|yuval10: N passed here, might be significent if EW will bid to 4@s|pg||
nt|poohbear: Yes. That says unblock please. 10 says dont unblock|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here 4 @h seems ro depend on right guess in @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it's all very well to double these artificial bids to show "cards"|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: but the critical thing is what your subsequent actions mean|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2nt?|pg||
nt|kaapo: If East had opened 1@S, that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i.e. what does double mean?|pg||
nt|yuval10: the 1@s in the OR helped the Italians to bid to the easy 3NT|pg||
nt|ronpa: when north fails to cover 8@C I think East will get the message|pg||
nt|gulyas: this looks like a slam you want to be in if the @H finesse is on, and you want to stay out of it if it fails|pg||
nt|gulyas: since its on, you want to bid it:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: is a new suit forcing or non-forcing?|pg||
nt|athene: if you haven't discussed these things, you are often worse-off after the first double|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: pass?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: but internet is a gigantic booster, nowadays|pg||
nt|hedyg: XX showing Hx in @s?|pg||
nt|tokay1975: gencler uyanik akarken dolduralim diyorlar|pg||
nt|gracelin: poland might score another game swing here.  Tough for NS t reach 4H after the 1NT response|pg||
nt|gracelin: North plans to bid H then spade to show his 3-suiter|pg||
nt|tomi2: I like Zatorskis 1@H bid, he is the player who bids 3 card suits and underleads aces more often than me :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: and let south decide the final contract|pg||
nt|kaapo: I'm not a fan of 1NT openings on 5M-4m hands|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: !!!|pg||
nt|capercliff: nice 4@h here but not a claimer|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|gracelin: south can raise to 3H when already denied a 4-card major|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: !!!|pg||
nt|lokaty: 2@S:)?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might as well bid 7, then|pg||
nt|santyclz: N needed to cash the @hs first with a @s entry to s to make the 2nd overtrick.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: very good players here|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would take 2@S here as showing values|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2S might show a minimum|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I wonder what 1@S is|pg||
nt|yuval10: already starts very interesting, 1@s perhaps one long suit|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think it is suction perhaps: @c or @h and @d|pg||
nt|henryb: a good small slam. a bad but making grand|pg||
mb|3D|nt|davidb: S  is very guite today  NV 2H is ok|pg||
nt|davidb: 5 D is makable still (club 3-3 ) |pg||
nt|hedyg: yes it certainly is. Juniors are much more exposed to international bridge|pg||
nt|ritong: being able to watch almost all of the best play on the planet everyday or so is unvaluable for these youngsters|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu el pek rahat deðil bence. depo doldurma operayonu açýsýndan|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: pass at 1 sp rdbl?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Many Swedes play what they call "Häxan", which is a close relative to Gazilli|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 1@S-1NT-2@C would not be natural|pg||
nt|kastan88: 2NT!= transfer to diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: and N decided to leave it which must indicate that he has many @s's|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, I have to go, have a good one, and check out Hungary leading the Schools event:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: good lead for declarer|pg||
nt|gracelin: it's alerted.|pg||
nt|othered1: Things are extremely friendly for a @H game here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can become a funny board|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=11&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Best contract.|pg||
nt|lokaty: bye|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bye Daniel|pg||
nt|gulyas: bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Bye Daniel, see you later|pg||
nt|ritong: start was automatic, the tough part is coming nox|pg||
nt|ritong: now*|pg||
nt|ritong: @dAQ look bright, i d try 4NT|pg||
nt|henryb: I have adopted a new method: 1@d-1@h-2@s is either a strong jump shift or a good heart raise to free up 1@d-1@h-3@h for hands like|pg||
nt|ritong: "no batteries included" as our friend john stewart uses to say|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ozgull: sistemlerinde 5 li h dengesiz davet|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2pik tek mi gösterdi?|pg||
nt|tokay1975: sanmam  2sp davet edicem birazdan gibi biseydi|pg||
nt|MolvaM: dengesiz olduðunu gördüm de daveti geremedim daha.  bakýyorum|pg||
nt|eerbil: bence 2nt kýsalýk sordu, 3@h de pik kýsa demek|pg||
nt|ozgull: 8 puan olunca zaten zon diyorlar:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not necessarily at these colours. North could pass with anything NV vs Vul|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this could get 500|pg||
nt|ronpa: good dbl by south, this will be painfull|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: -1?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: best lead|pg||
nt|gracelin: then 3D sign-off, unless north has extra.|pg||
nt|gracelin: looking at thse NS hands, I am not sure I want to be in 4H|pg||
nt|tomi2: but then you should not think that long|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: amazing:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: The other room are in 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: no overcall in OR by N|pg||
mb|3N|nt|raghavan: gets a OT|pg||
nt|kaapo: Parhaps that fact made East think it's better to open 1NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@C, @H, 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: I don't really know their system, all speculating.|pg||
nt|tomi2: this time partner has a prime hand, but every time he bids a game with a worse one and it makes, opps call TD and claim that thinking long for bidding 2@S suggest more then really ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: J@C coming down is key here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hayýrlýsý|pg||
nt|tokay1975: koz cýkýsna  3h olmaz|pg||
nt|MolvaM: delikanlý adam koz çýkmaz|pg||
nt|eerbil: gördüðümüz kadarý ile @d rua normal atak :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: evet @DK þablon|pg||
nt|Walddk4: as long as they are undoubled|pg||
nt|henryb: @sAxx, @hAQxx @d Kxxxx @c x|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: nice spot for NS|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 3nt  iyi aslýnda  bati dusunebilir 3nt demeyi|pg||
nt|eerbil: herhalde benim tahminim gibi deðil anlaþmalarý, çünkü öyle olsa erdem 3nt derdi|pg||
nt|begse: 3nt düþünmeli mutlaka|pg||
nt|tokay1975: herhangi bi davete o el 3nt dusunebilir|pg||
nt|tokay1975: cokda onemli diil ne daveti 6li h davette olsa|pg||
nt|gracelin: Indeed, and screen doesn't help here. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not a double to be proud of|pg||
nt|ronpa: -2 from top but if north tries a sneaky low @H it will turn to -1|pg||
nt|poohbear: No guess for the @c as West  known to have 2 aces and is a past hand|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk4: why give the show away?|pg||
nt|henryb: somehow one ought to be able to come closer to slam on these cards|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|charles_l: luckily only OTs at stake|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gracelin: the normal CQ lead will beat this|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|begse: ne olsa 3nt demek ya kendi lövem var ya kör tutuyorum demek|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: & 4 the girls: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=734&qroundno=12&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Best spot from Simonsen I belive, but need to find the 10th|pg||
nt|yuval10: not at all...but appearently was hopping that P can deliver at least 1 trick|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North will know south has trump tricks - bet he just cashes @HA|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|tomi2: i think a cross ruff and later exit might help|pg||
nt|othered1: we can see 11 tricks, but declarer is looking for the safest 10|pg||
nt|ronpa: we will soon find out|pg||
nt|poohbear: Ozturk should have played his most discouraging @H|pg||
nt|ronpa: well he can see AKQ@S in dummy like us but lets see if he resists the temptation of low @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: should have denied a @h trick here|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry Barry, i am too slow :(|pg||
nt|ronpa: anything but low @H will lead to -2 even a spade|pg||
nt|poohbear: :)|pg||
nt|ronpa: I think he should try another club promoting partner's mid @D cards having A@H as entry|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|tokay1975: evet|pg||
nt|tokay1975: cevapci hala 4h der isterse|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer might still make this with a cross ruff line and some intereesting ending|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Emma can and probably should make it after she has been told that spades break 5-0|pg||
mc|13|nt|vugraphztr: Bob claim: "tutti frutti" :)|pg||
nt|henryb: maybe even bid 4@d over 3?|pg||

nt|athene: Jones hoping to endplay north|pg||
nt|mariner1: well done push,,,,,,|pg||
nt|mariner1: seems making 5 here is easy enough,|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bence bu maçta özellikle açýk odada oynayan çiftimiz þehmuz ve mehmet güney güzel bir skor kaðýdý getirdiler|pg||
nt|tomi2: well played!|pg||
nt|gracelin: Nice play.  Bye all|pg||
nt|othered1: As shown, wasn't that only 10 tricks (@D, @C and @H off?)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Next board are 4@S at W|pg||
nt|rodal f: In the other room|pg||
nt|andy_h: Double partscore swing - reducing the deficit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: On the previous deal, note the nice @SJ discard by N, and then leading a @S to hand. Tough for W now to take the A with KQ in dummy|pg||
nt|yuval10: so the technical problems appearently caused some mess|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's somoething that of course is out of hand of everybody involving|pg||

nt|yuval10: for running scores from this event|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: srry I have big problems here....|pg||
nt|yuval10: click on Juniors or schools for the event you want to see|pg||
nt|yuval10: np, it happenes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We are closer to the truth now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hard to see that this will create a swing|pg||
nt|liviu123: bord 13  |pg||
nt|yuval10: yes, it's the problem , but the result here is correct|pg||
nt|liviu123: board 13 is another score|pg||
nt|yuval10: however, OR made it wrong, as 3@d was actu ally down 1|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1NT making was the correct score, so we might want to ask the operator of the Open Room for the right result in board 13|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 17 already played|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 77-35 is the score after 17|pg||
nt|poohbear: for the same reason Tarnovsky shoud not duck the club|pg||
nt|capercliff: well done, W didnt have space for for the A@s in his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: must be in 4S|pg||
nt|gracelin: oh, there are more boards.|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1H - 2NT - P - 4@S|pg||
nt|gh1: problem with club lead in 4s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will kill y|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: how?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: credit to the 2@C overcall, then|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: 4@s here|pg||
nt|babydolldk: 5@D -3 best defense|pg||
nt|raghavan: Charles - Has S gone to get u Red wine??|pg||
nt|babydolldk: 'defence|pg||
nt|poohbear: ble if you get there|pg||
nt|hedyg: hard to play @c instead of A@d when pd asked for @d|pg||
nt|MolvaM: arda ve erdem ise iniþli çýkýþlý gittiler ama net bilançolarý artý'da bence|pg||
nt|tomi2: yeah Europans are 20 boards each wihle World Championships are 16 boards and also 3 segments|pg||
nt|kaapo: Another nebulour 1@D here|pg||
nt|kaapo: *nebulous|pg||

mb|1C|nt|charles_l: :) hope so\|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no, she kept moving her thumb from 1@s to 2|pg||
nt|raghavan: If W does not bid D now, no future D contract|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 4major+1 is the most common boring flat board by a long way|pg||
nt|MolvaM: açýk odada birisi kontr demeyi unutmuþ. çok iyi skor|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@S - pass - pass - dbl?|pg||
mb|d|nt|MolvaM: bu 5 kör deklaresine ne buyrulur?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: batarý olmayan kontratý 1 atýþta buldu Erdem|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ah, West bid 1NT|pg||
nt|kaapo: I'm glad I didn't buy a lottery ticket today ;)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@D is around 11-15 if unbalanced or 13-16 balanced|pg||
nt|kaapo: So East is quite maximal and might find a move|pg||
nt|kaapo: I suppose Bethers isn't thinking, but Arvidsson|pg||
nt|othered1: Game in either pointed suit is possible NS, but may not be easy to handle|pg||
nt|ronpa: the Israeli NS at the other table did very well to let 5@C play and not bid 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: just needs K@C in pocket (and reasonable @S and other breaks) for slam|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@s is comfortable 5 is not|pg||
nt|poohbear: but it will make|pg||
nt|tokay1975: ben katýlýyorum 4h x bole bi el ifade edemez  ehveni ser cok begendim b|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hmm arda kötü þeyler düþünüyor|pg||
nt|eerbil: çok yüksek baþladý konuþma, tehlikeli bizim için|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kontru düþün arda baþka þeyleri boþver|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nop, N was|pg||
nt|po-s: perhaps Bech should have thought|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: clearly you shdnt buy that ticket|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D seems to be w2 in one major, and south hopes for more than those jacks in partners hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: which means that this will be flat|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
nt|mariner1: not likely to be slam hunting on 10 opposite 16|pg||
nt|athene: south might get interested now|pg||
nt|syl: w may dble this|pg||
nt|hedyg: S might get involved now|pg||
nt|ronpa: sure he's going to bid 4@S :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: game on a finesse . Missed in the other room. no big deal NV|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: W dreaming of KQ spade & A cl for a slam|pg||
nt|athene: but it's a bit pushy facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5@c is exclusion RKCB asking for aces but NOT the @c ace|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c non gf|pg||
nt|tomi2: I prefere 20 boards - we are playing championships, so why play 48 boards a day only...|pg||
nt|kastan88: 1@C = 11...14 bal or 441@D4 or 17+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or as Terje Lie say. 10 always. Will get a @H ruff might|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|raghavan: E has passed |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: (after consulting CC)|pg||
nt|gracelin: Ok, will stay on. Can't miss this slam hand.|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hejssan PO|pg||
nt|po-s: hej|pg||
nt|kaapo: You'd have passed as West?|pg||
nt|gh1: ggod lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's a bold prediction, Roland :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: only 3|pg||
nt|ritong: so 3NT, @c Q lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: yep but ...|pg||
nt|poohbear: so a misunderstanding and finally I get to say a possible pickup for my friends from Croatia :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Maybe Davor is here:):)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: & Zvonimir:)|pg||
nt|tokay1975: obur taraftan onunda tedbir etmesi lazim 6h yapamicaklari acik rakibin deklarasyonundan  esit zon durumunda|pg||
nt|tokay1975: x diyebilir teklif gibi  dayanabiliyosan birak dayanamiyosan 6h de |pg||
nt|hedyg: why 4@H?|pg||
nt|henryb: I am afraid I too must leave you, Henri.|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a vous, henry|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: showing an acol style 2@d opening with the 3@d bid|pg||
nt|ritong: this shouyld not survive|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, not on a @s lead..|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 2Diam GF & 2Cl semiforcing|pg||
nt|ritong: unless west tries to have a glance at dummy|pg||
nt|tokay1975: ama pas  demeside kabul edebilir|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it will be on a finesse at best if partner has the perfect @HA @CAJ|pg||
nt|mariner1: and E might have an important card too, and does here with K@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: well S should win A@C and pull @S and lead a @c|pg||
nt|athene: @CA, draw trumps|pg||
nt|poohbear: Who are they?|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D confirms the strong variant of polish club and asks partner for further information|pg||
nt|tomi2: 3@C confirmed 5 hearts and some extras, 3@H sets trumps and starts slam investigation|pg||
nt|po-s: absolutely - East has max 15|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like it's going to be easier than I thought|pg||
nt|tomi2: nice lead here found by hoffmeister although a small club would be nice too ;)|pg||
nt|ronpa: this will have hard time making|pg||
nt|hedyg: E bid 3@c twice, how many does he need?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possibly a bidding misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|ritong: i tend to like the U26 thing|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: France back up to 6 VP now|pg||
nt|frusco: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: E showing min - W gave up. flat|pg||
nt|davidb: " new york syndrom "|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose he might play low on the basis that even @CK, club ruff, diamond isn't beating|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Davor Suker & Zvonimir Boban:):)|pg||
nt|poohbear: OK....................|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6 kör demediði için artýk ne dese mutlu oluruz :)|pg||
nt|tokay1975: splinterle  basladi  bidding  goremez  hemen 3love hde almiyolarsa|pg||
nt|tokay1975: normal|pg||
nt|ozgull: no double no trouble|pg||
nt|gracelin: The Polish Club in operation|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes ty Adrian|pg||
nt|gracelin: 5 is probably exclusion RKC|pg||
nt|tomi2: 5@D asks for keycards outside the @D suit, but unfortunatly east has a hand where he could even pass this|pg||
nt|tomi2: I am asked why undos are accepted in this match, I can explain you:|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: when you see an undo it means in 99% of the cases, that the operator made a misclick|pg||
nt|tomi2: and not one of the players|pg||
nt|kastan88: 1@H= 7...11 , 3+@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: does 2@d show fit in @c 100%?|pg||
nt|ronpa: Padon couldnt start with 2@H directly over 2@C which is nf|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ???|pg||
nt|ronpa: no 2@D is just forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: and probably declarer will stagger home via @h J hook after discovering the horrible @d break|pg||
pc|s6|nt|othered1: cue-bid at south's second turn, unless a transfer to @D, wouldn't be everyone's choice.|pg||
nt|andy_h: South was obviously hoping for @HKQ-6th with North...but didn't 3@C say weak with hearts, Bas?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|tomi2: one poor guy is sitting close to the table and tries to record the cardplay for all of us here in BBO|pg||
nt|tomi2: most often players play either very slow or very fast, so in the "fast" case it is hard to follow all cards and bids|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mr Sikora is now counting on his fingers :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: Nawrocki was surely imagining counting on his fingers|pg||
nt|gracelin: 5NT shows two but I onkt see 1 key card outside D in East's hand.|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: must've gone wrong somewhere. restarted the count|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes something is wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: probably the false 5nt is giving him headache|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would expect 2 keycards and no @HQ from east using my fingers to count|pg||
nt|Walddk4: A bit annoying to watch a board that has been played already|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he felt obliged to show his @hs now?|pg||
nt|hedyg: this reminds me of bd 7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|poohbear: yes girl Make them pay|pg||

nt|othered1: very well done|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I'd just bid 4@D, I think|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I've shown P a very good hand bidding that way|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||

nt|liviu123: 17 is null 4H+1 |pg||
nt|ritong: okay, wipe all that:)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: but there is just no way west is underleading the @CK here|pg||

nt|mariner1: Work)|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he can certainly ruff @H if E cashes the K@C|pg||
nt|athene: are we still here?|pg||
nt|mariner1: ruff HIGH|pg||
nt|kaapo: A good point yes, you aren't really going anywhere (but trouble perhaps) by bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and where you know the result|pg||
nt|spaima: link for runing scores? |pg||
pc|sK|nt|mariner1: E hoping there is a play that is hard to see, there isn't|pg||
nt|gracelin: the 3rd step 5NT should show 2 key cards without HQ, so West knows someting is still missing for the grand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did S miss?|pg||
nt|gh1: he sleep home now|pg||
nt|rodal f: @SA - and a new @C.|pg||
nt|yuval10: why? you can make some bet with your friends about it|pg||
nt|yuval10: like i bet the lead will be.....2@d|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think @S6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|charles_l: maybe he distusts W's bidding 3@d|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: the Ace holding mr. Simonsen is now asking for a recapitulation of the bidding|pg||
nt|tomi2: this needs some "thorowaway" squeeze|pg||
nt|gracelin: but from east's point of view, if no key-card is missing, he wants to be in seven|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You win|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|yuval10: lol i had a safety though, according to running scores|pg||
nt|ritong: nice lead, i wouldn t find it, thinking my pard has a positional opening, and thus a good @c suit|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tomi2: west was probably asking for 3rd round kontrol in clubs and E thought he made no mistake and had this control and running tricks|pg||
nt|gracelin: good lead, save everybody time and energy|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: now mr Simonsen is asking for a recapitulation with his partner :)|pg||
nt|liviu123: it is on live score 2@D :)|pg||
nt|ritong: first move will certainly be cashing a top @d, then it will go faster|pg||
pc|d3|nt|MolvaM: türkiyenin maçýnýn verilip verilmeyeceði yarýn sabah belli olacak|pg||
nt|tomi2: would not be the best lead if E had club void|pg||
nt|rodal f: If @H was played defence needed to play @S before a new @C for 1 down. Not easy|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|raghavan: well made 4 - H goes in CA|pg||
nt|ritong: noone tried the zia joke?|pg||
nt|ritong: usually , 3@s shows a solid suit and asks for a @s stopper|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Hmmm? What's that|pg||
pc|c3|nt|MolvaM: ve günlül bültene bakarak görebilirsiniz|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|kaapo: I suppose he must with 15-16|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ritong: zia s version is " hey mate i ve got a @s stopper  do you have a solid suit?"|pg||

nt|santyclz: I think it's: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Results.htm|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk4: N-S have 4 tricks against a heart contract if they want them|pg||
mb|2S|nt|charles_l: 12 tricks - 2 losers|pg||
nt|gracelin: I only blame him for not doubling.|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: time for some more gazing at the ceiling|pg||
mb|d|nt|tokay1975: splinter yapildiktan sonra  bunu kontrlamak bence mucize |pg||
nt|tokay1975: cok zor|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North led a trump next door, hence the overtrick|pg||
nt|hedyg: only 3 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: 4 boards  to go -most of the swings -2 slams -normal   in a match between 2 good teams |pg||
nt|athene: perhaps 3@H is just too high in fact|pg||
nt|athene: redouble to play from south? :)|pg||
nt|athene: a modern idea is to use the redouble to show a different hand|pg||
nt|athene: you can either play that pass = 2 hearts only|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H = 3 hearts min|pg||
nt|athene: and xx = 3 hearts max|pg||
nt|athene: or you can play that 2@H = 3 hearts, positional|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 800 seyirciye ulaþtýk|pg||
nt|ronpa: look how agressive the young players are, both room bidding 1@H with north cards|pg||
nt|ritong: annoying|pg||
nt|ritong: strength is ok, but @s stopper is thin|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: and xx = 3 hearts, prefers pd to play it|pg||
nt|athene: typically with something like @Dxxx|pg||
nt|athene: in case pd has a diamond tenace|pg||
nt|mariner1: REDBL must show a real NT and a fit|pg||

nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=14|pg||
nt|mariner1: -  Results this round|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thanks Rob|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Heya Rob :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: or a willingness to play @D I suppose|pg||
nt|athene: if north has a problem, the XX must be to play|pg||
nt|tomi2: 7@D on finding @DQ and this error and the match is close again|pg||
nt|kaapo: North has long support but no strength, shape, nor @C honours|pg||
nt|ritong: hi rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: sorry was sending to a kibber :)|pg||
nt|ritong: nice of you|pg||
mb|3C|nt|tomi2: could be a huge win for poland instead|pg||
nt|andy_h: A chance for Netherlands to pick up here - but it's hard to see where the 7th trick is going to come from|pg||
nt|liviu123: only if play @D on time :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: If they do not cash Clubs - will make 12. May not lead from CA xxx|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S worked well in Open Room|pg||
nt|athene: if it showed 3 hearts, north wld bid 2@H like a shot|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: where is this going?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: or 4 @S much better|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT=clubs and diamonds?|pg||
nt|ronpa: I doubt it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good question as to whether 2@C should be a UCB-type bid against Polish club|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe 3@s then pass anything|pg||
nt|ritong: but 4@h:)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|gracelin: EW has a lucky 6D/6NT here.  But shouldn't be bid.|pg||
nt|kaapo: East is very maximum for his limited opening|pg||
nt|po-s: 4sp by Simon?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: the Swedes have nothing printed on the ceiling... the thinking is done by staring at the screen :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: 3 nt from W might have been better ?|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@c prob starts a get out sequence|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or youthful exuberance?|pg||
nt|poohbear: and South Quickly gets out :P|pg||
nt|ronpa: thats nice to see that even they respond that light they have the methods and dicipline to stop|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think North was trying to get out in 3@h|pg||
nt|poohbear: South knew better|pg||
nt|poohbear: Board 16 wasnt scored here. Norway has 5 more imps|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I saw|pg||
nt|ritong: meanwhile poles grabbed 10 imps finding a poetic moysian 6@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: i wonder if 2@c is GF @c or bal|pg||
nt|charles_l: it is a common treatment|pg||
nt|davidb: D  guess for the contract |pg||
nt|athene: i prefer to bid over 1NT with that west hand|pg||
nt|kaapo: I hope it's the sreen that divides that table and not your screen ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: lol, yes :)|pg||
nt|othered1: This is a not very lucky spot.  4@S on the west hand, however, is very pushy.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but you do need some sort of UCB in these positions|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you can't go letting people play in 2@H when you have spades!|pg||
nt|mariner1: so Greece likely to pickup a dual part score swing here|pg||
nt|poohbear: severe comunication problems oin this hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: East isnt going anywhere|pg||
nt|eerbil: evet 4 daha|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 5@c after a short consultation of the system on the ceiling|pg||
mb|p|nt|syl: "You dont comment this bid???"-asks a kib|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I dont have time to comment|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nuclear war|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This may well roll in|pg||
nt|poohbear: I wonder if 3@c could have been a strong hand?|pg||
nt|ritong: not an everyday auction|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|poohbear: If north leads a @h declarer will happily cash alot of tricks|pg||
nt|poohbear: on a @s lead declarer gets endplayed in hand|pg||
nt|othered1: no return looks attractive to north.  East likely hasn't guaranteed 5@S, so trump shift could be costly, too.|pg||
nt|othered1: as cards lie, @C is very effective|pg||
nt|othered1: And huge hitch may help east work out where things are.  Just won't be very helpful this time.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: LOl |pg||
nt|sybarra2: Bas are they playing with screens? |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Yes|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Both above and underneath the table surface|pg||
nt|yuval10: only @d lead, or @c and @d shift, beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not so easy for the defence to cash their tricks in the right order|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and we also know that it makes!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Because Sweden have 6 more IMPs on the official scoreboard|pg||
nt|Walddk4: after board 18|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is nothing more than a recorded broadcast. Very annoying|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: he might have bid 2@S over 2@H if east hadn't doubled|pg||
nt|athene: although of course he wouldn't have been in balancing seat|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s some relay?|pg||
nt|ritong: probably some puppet auction|pg||
nt|hedyg: Rusinow style lead, KQ@H, no J or 10|pg||
nt|ritong: mm...Q = please do not unblock, rather  means suit is not that solid|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|ritong: K would impose an unblock if available|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.bridgeguys.com/RGlossary/RusinowLeads.html|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: it,s trandy to lead Q from RQxx|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 1h xi gordum inanilir gibi diil ya ben anormalim yada gozlerim iyi gormuyor artik|pg||
nt|ritong: does ucb mean unmaterial cue bid?|pg||
nt|lokaty: we play that in Poland, so maybe it still should:)|pg||
nt|capercliff: N and S both pushed a bit here|pg||
nt|santyclz: There's a more direct url, but it's too long to post, someone want to "tinyurl" it?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|charles_l: !NEXT :)|pg||
nt|athene: better just to wade in on the first round, if you ask me|pg||
nt|mariner1: I agree, and W in Open Room did that|pg||
nt|MolvaM: rakip natürel 1 pik dedikten sonra 2 pike gelip yapana ne denir? bravo? |pg||

pc|hQ|nt|raghavan: I appreciate N not following South's que bid. |pg||
nt|poohbear: cash 2 @cs and take your best shot in @ds?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: wow, almost overkill |pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT= long @cs, 16+, 0-2 @hs|pg||
pc|hK|nt|capercliff: the lure of a vulnerable game proved big and N has a "better than 15" hand|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|poohbear: looks like that is the plan|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ritong: certainly so, the idea is to explain why:)|pg||

nt|MolvaM: ters zon durumunda yduruk 5li koz ile 3 seviyesinde overcall|pg||
nt|tomi2: E/W are playing 2nd/4th leads and W lead the @Ht without thinking about it it seems, he could have seen that the ten will cost a trick and lead a small heart if he wanted to lead a ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Whee|pg||
nt|andy_h: 3@C preemptive would not be my choice with a constructive hand. But nevertheless, it's attractive because of w/r vulnerability and that partner's a passed hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This board has also been played, no swing|pg||
nt|hedyg: you are in a hurry LOL|pg||
nt|ritong: nope|pg||
mb|2S|nt|MolvaM: ortak pastan geliyor|pg||
nt|tomi2: here, in the other romm it was an artifical bid to show weak hands|pg||
nt|rodal f: Adrian the vug operater have done a wery nice job. THX:) Well done.|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: TY ALL:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: one more match?|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes, Israel vs Sweden later|pg||
nt|ronpa: last board has big swing potential for Israel as they turkey pair overbid to a no chance slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: we have 1 more broadcast today|pg||
nt|hedyg: in about 54 minutes|pg||
nt|frusco: 6@d lucky contract|pg||
nt|capercliff: looking at the E/W cards in isolation of course I wouldnt want to play it|pg||
nt|tdrijverrr: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hi is lucky|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hiTom|pg||
nt|tdrijverrr: hello|pg||
nt|tdrijverrr: 4 harts will be nice|pg||
nt|ritong: would, you mean|pg||
mb|2N|nt|MolvaM: ne diyeceksin buna?|pg||
nt|ozgull: bordu egale etmeye çalýþýyorlar|pg||
nt|eerbil: biraz önceki kontra bu overcall yanýnda hiçbiþey denmez|pg||
nt|ritong: THANK YOU PARD  YOU OWED ME ONE|pg||
nt|ritong: the layout is far from the worst possible|pg||
nt|mdgraham: everybody laughs at dummy, no doubt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the vulnerability is not in EW's favour|pg||
nt|ritong: they are not protected with hcps either, with a total of 22 opponents are not likely to bid and make a game|pg||
mb|p|nt|babydolldk: well... next:) 4@S|pg||
nt|charles_l: perhaps 4@h shows another handttype|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2 over 1 response forcing - 3H is support N does not know about S hand yet. He only says game in H|pg||
nt|tokay1975: bu el x diyebilir  biraz risk alir|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: not the best lead I thin|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 'think|pg||
nt|poohbear: ahhhh Adrian is just quitting early :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: is that right?|pg||
nt|tdrijverrr: no will :-)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|le joker: /°|pg||
nt|le joker: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H is relay|pg||
nt|ritong: hi alex|pg||
nt|hedyg: bonjour Alexandre|pg||
mb|p|nt|babydolldk: yes, you are right, just wondering if s had a @C cue, would they still have played 4@H, how could n know it was rigt to bid 4@H....|pg||
nt|babydolldk: 'right|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: still thinking...|pg||
nt|raghavan: Can I surmise the bidding as = 1C strong 1D <8 points, 2D both Majors 2H says Spades S agrees on S Is it OK Charles, Anita?|pg||
nt|babydolldk: yes!|pg||
nt|le joker: bonjour tout le monde :)|pg||
nt|le joker: hi |pg||
nt|gracelin: 1H showed 3-card support, but strength unlimited.|pg||
nt|tomi2: don't know if they have some agreement on the double, it could be @D only or takeout on 1@H|pg||
nt|tomi2: west bid 1@S in case partner has support, he still had @Daxxx in bag in case he finds out partner has only dias and no spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: "MENSTRUATIESTOORNIS"|pg||
nt|tdrijverrr: lol|pg||
nt|ritong: uh?|pg||
nt|tdrijverrr: the famous Drijver game yes|pg||
nt|ritong: you guys smoke tough stuff:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: seems he still believes its takeout because he did not lead @D|pg||
nt|gracelin: I can see eleven tricks here so maybe another 1 imps to Norway.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer needs to test clubs early.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: NS in 4@S -50  in Open Room here|pg||
nt|athene: @SAKQ @DA is a bit of a flaw in 4@S|pg||
nt|poohbear: merely overtricks involved|pg||
nt|ritong: no big sweat here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12 tops|pg||
nt|ritong: just has to play to the end just in case|pg||
nt|hedyg: no extras|pg||
nt|rodal f: THX to The Romanian Bridgefederation and BBO with all there nice helpers for bringing this event to us. Roland Wald at least by his nice woork.|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2NT is trf to 3@c, and 3NT showed stopper in @h|pg||
pc|s2|nt|poohbear: best lead for the defense|pg||
nt|ritong: possible sqz|pg||
nt|ritong: although unlikely|pg||
pc|s5|nt|charles_l: i dont know their methods|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: writing down bidding explanations now|pg||
nt|raghavan: as if I know. I inly guess on seeing their bids|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes proved to be :)|pg||
nt|ritong: have to hit same defender with @s KQ and @h QJ|pg||
nt|kastan88: slam time, 6 clubs here: 4 top tricks in side suits give away 1 @H and then crossruff. But that is not easy to find|pg||
nt|pelu: perfect distribution for NS - but difficult to bid a slam on 25 HCP|pg||
nt|tdrijverrr: would  you are very right|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tokay1975: ama 3h  ozellikle belirtim (bnm icin) konu disi|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: now the other side is doing the same|pg||
nt|raghavan: only|pg||
nt|kastan88: hej, Peter|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi Jaak|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Maybe E should've kept the @SJ, for W had only 4@S as well, this way he could've avoided W leading into Aces and a long suit|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kaapo: Heart to queen would be declarer's 9th trick|pg||
nt|kaapo: @D to queen less succesful|pg||
nt|santyclz: Walter Johnson points out the top spot was probably defending 1@hx'd.|pg||

nt|mariner1: 732&qroundno=3-   results after session|pg||
nt|tomi2: he will maybe follow Zatorskis line for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: if only he knew how small the diff. is...|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1 Imp is actually 1 VP, yes?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Keeping the @HA retains the control of the suit|pg||
nt|kaapo: So if this doesn't succeed, he can still have a shot at diamonds|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mug: the Open Room score doesn't appear in the movie, but England were one down in 4@S here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bordu egale etmeye çalýþmak çok güzel bir tanýmlama.  maçtan sonra ortaklarý susturmak için iþe yarar|pg||
nt|poohbear: this defense saves the overtrick|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: one more broadcast|pg||
nt|poohbear: 10 of @ds will score|pg||
nt|ritong: and anyways, i think marion will hook @hs|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|raghavan: how do these players get these leads? helping D -|pg||
nt|ronpa: yes|pg||
pc|h4|nt|MolvaM: oðlum çýldýrdýn mý diye sorana bordu egale ediyordum dedik mi sorun kalmaz|pg||
nt|po-s: well played, testing hearts first if it fails then the D finesse|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphztr: i dont have the scale, sorry|pg||
nt|gracelin: 0-2 is 15-15|pg||

nt|hedyg: i would have cashed the @cs first|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: first time Vugraph operator|pg||
nt|hedyg: you are doing fine Adrian , it's a tuff job!|pg||
nt|ritong: extremely tough, right|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: alright, this is the last board of the segment|pg||
nt|kaapo: 5@CX brought 12 IMPs to Sweden, while other table failed to make 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thx Kari & Po|pg||
nt|kaapo: Indeed it is. Thanks a lot Florin. Excellent job and excellent boards too :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: last bd.  |pg||

nt|sybarra2: thx to Bas, our brilliant operator |pg||
nt|sybarra2: and thx to Ed Shapiro for joining me |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: My pleasure Shirley :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and the last 4 today|pg||
nt|andy_h: yes, definitely ideal for BAM :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: if P didn't lead your suit, you'd assumer he has a reason for it|pg||
nt|hedyg: in 1 hour and 32 minutes|pg||
nt|hedyg: 22 minutes LOL|pg||
nt|frusco: +1 italy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 500 - that will do nicely for France|pg||
nt|lokaty: and the last one is not interesting.|pg||
nt|ritong: i m not sure...isn t 1 imp 15/15?|pg||
nt|lokaty: so no changes for both teams.|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: SRY|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: last board for this nice table|pg||
mb|1D|nt|davidb: 19 tricks in M' s|pg||

nt|hedyg: 1 hour and 22 minutes|pg||
nt|mikael_w: all it did was setting up some hi @c:s for defense|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mariner1: many thanks to all the sponsors and organizers for helping BBO bring us the|pg||
nt|mariner1: vugraphs!|pg||
nt|gracelin: Norway can sacrifice in 5D here to tie the match, or to push opponents to 5S for a win.|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C isn't natural|pg||
nt|capercliff: 2@c is 5-5 minors?|pg||
nt|capercliff: or precision type?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 2@c precision|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here 4@s will go 1 down|pg||
nt|capercliff: right tx|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: and thanks for their wit and insight to my co-commentators William Frisby and Mike|pg||
nt|mariner1: Gold (Great Britain), and Roland Wald (Denmark).....I am Rob Brown (USA)........|pg||
nt|hedyg: i like the upgrade to 1NT|pg||
nt|tomi2: they play 4 card suits, yes?|pg||
nt|hedyg: last bd now|pg||
mb|2C|nt|charles_l: and to Anita & Raghavan|pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at it!|pg||

nt|athene: a heart lead is nice, whoever declares|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N in N made 4 here in Open Room|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: thx commentators. i hope i'll see yo u again in a few hours|pg||
nt|MolvaM: milli takýmlarýmýza da baþarýlar|pg||
nt|kaapo: 6@D would need @Ds 2-2|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and I am sure there are many more to thank for bringing this to bbo vugraph |pg||
nt|Walddk4: No game makes on best defence|pg||
nt|yuval10: S elects to bid 4@h, which might very well be conventional|pg||
nt|yuval10: with perfect def. 4@h is going down 2|pg||
nt|po-s: maybe|pg||
mb|2S|nt|davidb: thx all . see you later |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thanks, bye|pg||
nt|poohbear: this should buy it|pg||
nt|eerbil: tebrikler gençlerimize|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Take away the 2000 (17 IMPs) and this woul've been a much closer match|pg||
nt|hedyg: thank you Adrian, great job|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: East downgrades somewhat - he has 11 HCP but it doesn't look good|pg||
nt|athene: he expects to need 9 fast tricks on a heart lead to make 3nt|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes its not a quality 11 at all|pg||
nt|MolvaM: önümüzdeki günlerde yapýlacak türkiye maçlarýnda gene birlikte olmak dileði ile|pg||
nt|ozgull: umarým bu maç milliler için çýkýþa geçme maçýdýr. Fena oynamadýlar baþarýlar diliyoruz|pg||
nt|kaapo: This time it is not so|pg||
nt|kaapo: The bidding might look Polish Club now|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@C could be a puppet to 2@D|pg||
nt|poohbear: thats one way to avoid slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: mirror 4333 shapes never play well|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: Open Room result by the way was 1NT +3|pg||
nt|athene: and he has no aces and no long suit...|pg||
nt|tomi2: so Poland will win this 16-14.  Thx to both teams for this interesting set|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, tough to find the sacrifice after 4S.  Yes, I agree with specs' comments that both pairs performed very well at their age.  They might be the future of our game.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, thanks Adrian|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: double denied 4 spades, i assume, so 2@S is just offering to play the Moysian|pg||
nt|le joker: thanks all ! see you in 3rd match :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ty all see U in an hour|pg||
nt|ritong: so, 44 imps gap|pg||
nt|tokay1975: tebrikler genclere|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps intending to show an invitational hand later|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Ty for help|pg||
nt|ronpa: look at the different view. other table West opened and east drove to slam. here west passed and east undervalued his 18 to 17 |pg||
pc|dA|nt|ozgull: 22 - 8 ile günü kapatmak  iyi moral tebrikler gençler|pg||
nt|yuval10: X should indicate @d lead |pg||
nt|hedyg: thanks to my fellow commentators, Arigun, Barry, Ron and Mike|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: erm|pg||
nt|po-s: then 3D would  show his full hand (North´s)|pg||
nt|kaapo: If 2@C was a puppet to 2@D (including the option of passing 2@D), North's not bidding 2@D would show extra strength|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mug: imaginative 2@S bid from Bell, he has denied four of them, so 2@S shows three, maximum for his bidding, partner can work it out|pg||
nt|ritong: make that 36|pg||
nt|tomi2: next segment will be in 50 Minutes I rhink|pg||
nt|capercliff: well bid|pg||
nt|mikael_w: offcurse the @c A would ba a likely leed witch is not good|pg||
nt|athene: this should be two down, but the defence slipped up in the other room|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: taking the heart ruff in the short hand if partner has 4-3-3-3 or something like that|pg||
nt|po-s: I suggested 3D - would show extra AND his shape|pg||

nt|othered1: Thanks, Shirley, Bas and specs.|pg||
nt|yuval10: at least according to Emma, i guess|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mariner1: so E has an 11 worth less than face value|pg||
nt|fahir: tüm yorumculara teþekkürler, Brasov dan iyi akþamlar|pg||
nt|po-s: and would get a potential 3NT played by South|pg||
nt|kaapo: There might be trouble in 3@D if North hasn't shown real clubs yet|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps 1@S could be 18+ (or so) with 5+@S|pg||
nt|po-s: well, yes, who knows - do they have a convention card?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mariner1: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi   K&R|pg||
nt|tomi2: we will have Sweden - Latvia and Netherlands - France|pg||

pc|d8|nt|mariner1: the good news here in N does not have a high @c pip|pg||
nt|hedyg: to the organisers for sharing this event with us|pg||
nt|capercliff: hard to settle for 4@s|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kaapo: And there they are|pg||
nt|po-s: and North or South probably forgot what 2C was|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: massive consultations on both sides of the screen|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: in the OR N is in 3NT|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, yes, maybe they have to work on their CC a little bit more themselves, too|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and made +3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ritong: i havent the VP scale under my eyes, presumably 21 or 22 VPs to frenchies|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmmm missed the @c switch for -1!|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: the defence can organize south a heart ruff but that doesn't help them enormously|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry i was in 4@s :(|pg||

nt|hedyg: no :(|pg||

nt|kastan88: yes, good result for Latvia in Open room|pg||
pc|sA|nt|raghavan: S has to give atleast a Spade and 2Clubs|pg||

nt|mariner1: well that play worked for S|pg||
nt|athene: pressure play from south!|pg||

nt|athene: west doesn't want to lose to @CQ and then @C9 on the overruff and @CA@DA to come|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mug: don't think South would have played a trump from @CAxx|pg||

nt|ritong: amusing|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|rodal f: And then 9 are on|pg||
nt|ritong: trump promo, but sgrouich|pg||
nt|poohbear: So looks like Israel will win this match 21-9 a very important victory over a team that was ahead of them|pg||
nt|poohbear: and France is losing to the Czech republic so the field is tightening a little|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: good lead & good defence Israel|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Israel on 5 place|pg||
nt|tdrijverrr: close match it is|pg||
nt|ritong: indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: good teams|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mariner1: now he can lose 9@C in ruff too|pg||
nt|athene: if south really did have @CA9x and want a heart over-ruff, it would be more natural for him to try spades and diamonds to find partner's ace|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps lead a diamond simply to try to set up a diamond ruff for partner|pg||
nt|athene: so perhaps that small trump was suspicious - but not at all easy for declarer to be fair|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tdrijverrr: yes indeed|pg||
nt|tdrijverrr: next match i advise you to take Drijver_12  as commentator|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lokaty: :)|pg||

pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mikael_w: another even board :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: You don't get the reputation as a world-class gift giver without misdefending the occasional game.|pg||
nt|athene: the defence was effectively identical in the other room - at the critical point, instead of playing a trump, west played a third diamond through declarer, trying to promote ...|pg||
nt|athene: something in hearts in his partner's hand|pg||
nt|capercliff: perhaps its easy for us when seeing all the cards|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thanks all, see you in 1 hour and 15 minutes or so|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks all, bye for now.|pg||
nt|capercliff: thanks all|pg||
