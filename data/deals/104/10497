nt|vugraphztr: I'd probably lead a @D, for I don't want to lead into decl's suit, not trumps and not away from Kxxxx|pg||

nt|andy_h: Usually in these types of auctions where 1 person has shown 2 suits and their partner took preference, is to lead trumps.|pg||

nt|andy_h: Sometimes they say, don't bother looking at any of your other cards. Lead a trump no matter what! (Usually will work 85% of the time I assure you)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Gerben42: Netherlands as usual medal candidates in this competition, but this match will be a tough one|pg||

nt|MolvaM: bu maça girerken türkiye 23 tk arasýnda 15. durumda|pg||

nt|MolvaM: ilk 15?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ilk 23?|pg||
nt|ozgull: her takým büyük hedeflerle gider ancak bence ilk 10 iyi olur |pg||
nt|tomi2: but then its most 85% of the time wrong to lead a trump singleton - what a problem :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Trump couped by pd, how nice|pg||
nt|andy_h: Then you get your heart tricks in return :) But if partner has some trump intermediates, you have gained :)|pg||
mc|9|nt|tomi2: now they took the disadvantages from both theories I think|pg||

nt|kaapo: 1NT might be 11-13 or so|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 2@D probably a multi style, showing a long major|pg||
nt|tomi2: Max Ellerbeck did :)|pg||
nt|andy_h: I would. Maybe South is worried about @Hxxx but that wouldn't detour me in not doubling. By X-ing you get 3 suits across|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: The U26 Open category has a day off today, hence they don't have running scores|pg||
nt|tomi2: south is now "endplayed" I think he should try some kind of 2NT bid and wait for something good to happen|pg||
nt|Gerben42: for me 2NT is not natural in auctions where one opp opened and the other bid|pg||

mb|d|nt|davidb: Sp 3-3 so 6H makable|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d alerted as Walsh i assume|pg||
nt|ronpa: No reason to do something else|pg||
nt|mdgraham: here, of course, 3NT may be a club stop and running diamonds, so it is not so clear|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @C10 and a small spade from dummy?|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: belki de 10-12 dir?|pg||
nt|eerbil: tek þansýmýz oynayanýn trefl asýný ilk 2 turdan birinde almasý, ki pek olasý bir oyun deðil|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ingiltere takýmý da genel klasman 11.si|pg||
nt|kaapo: 4@S is a great contract and 5@D an excellent sacrifice|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: France are at the moment at the top of the U26 group|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I can imagine S being especially unlucky, given his semi-wasted @S values|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: c|pg||
nt|andy_h: I personally wouldn't have bid with N's hand. All it's going to do is that it may excited partner (when you don't really want to given the void in clubs). Given N has 3spadeds ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: (marking shortage with partner) then S may still re-open|pg||
nt|Gerben42: i wouldnt have doubled in N either... what if pd simply has 12 HCP and good 6-card @C, I dont want to be anywhere|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Dbl of 3@S = dont lead that pd|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: Decl can't handle the Jxxx with W|pg||

nt|mdgraham: admirably direct|pg||

mb|p|nt|Jacki: Please let me know if you need to be ungagged|pg||

nt|yuval10: question is - does S unlimited in this sequence? i think he's limited , by 3@d|pg||

mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: Yers|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vdoubleu: yes.|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, you can sustain a bad diamond break (or guess) in clubs more easily than in diamonds.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: Yes, key here.|pg||
nt|kareno: Only a club gives away nothing.|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: N is lucky that E bid 4S|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: Why?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: confirmed 4d= blackwood 4s 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with no X of 4S, may avoid that suit on lead|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: OK., maybe.|pg||
nt|reisig: @c seems pretty safe|pg||
pc|h8|nt|marlowepi: he will itch to lead a trump, but finally wont i predict|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: safe yes, but against small slam will tend to attack. it is not like N is sitting behind declarer's tenaces with high cards|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|nt|kareno: Declarer's pitches not boding well for this contract unless he plans to float the diamond jack.|pg||

nt|kaapo: First board, which we mostly missed, was a push. The double on board 2 brought Latvia the first 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|kaapo: More wild distributions|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would have overcalled 2@c   but if I was going to bring @ds in I would bid 2NT|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4NT is excessive|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree,  seemed a bit much|pg||
nt|sybarra: that lovely sp suited opened in both rooms |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: The strength of your hand are the @Cs, not your distribution per se, I think|pg||
nt|Gerben42: nice fit EW but no slam|pg||
nt|tomi2: you can watch Max Ellerbeck's nice defense to 3@S in the movie, he found the @C ruff in 2nd trick accorcing to their signaling methods and so they defeated 3@S|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|Gerben42: the 9 showed the @C switch?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can't really blame West for passing 2@C. Maybe East should have opened - his hand sure looked like an opening bid|pg||
nt|ritong: ok, time to wake up, jan|pg||
nt|elbec: manno and di franco play weak no trump "Nightmare" style|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3N EW has play|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: Ok that was easy|pg||
nt|kastan88: IMO problem starts from South bid 3@S, he may see probable misfit, but we must remember these ara juniors, so blood is hot|pg||
nt|sybarra: now how do you play 2 nt here?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Not so sure I would overcall 1NT here, I like 2@D|pg||

nt|ritong: if you don t , yopu might get caught in a bad spiral|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kaapo: My second guess is that NS play polish club|pg||

nt|sybarra: pass or correct?|pg||
nt|henryb: to respond or not to respond, that is the question|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: interesting |pg||
nt|ronpa: nice agreement of 3@H to play, but only 8 trix because of bad @H break|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like five rapid losers|pg||
nt|charles_l: what style is that?|pg||
mb|p|nt|elbec: 1@c is 15+ with 4or+@c or 15-17 balanced or 24+any|pg||
mb|3S|nt|waso: maybe 1nt 16-18|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: very conservative 2 passes by S |pg||

nt|vugraphztr: we are already at board 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: bu bakýmdan bir þekilde karo üzerinden keycard sormayý denkleþtirmek iyi fikir olabilir|pg||
nt|ozgull: karo k pik as olsa mesala 13 hcp|pg||
nt|eerbil: Ingiliz takýmý zon durumuna göre deðiþken 1NT açýþý kullanýyor gibiler, uygun zon durumu 10-12 olsa gerek|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: Latvia dont alert the 3-rd dbl:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: what would 2NT after 2@S have been? |pg||
nt|tomi2: 2NT does not exist but must be forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Curiously, the scoring system seems to believe there hasn't been an exchange of IMPs yet in this match|pg||
nt|ronpa: 2@S also goes down|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Hi Charles1|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphztr: one down?|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: hard decision 4 Mr. Lauks|pg||
nt|kastan88: now it is hard to West find good bid another than pass|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: he will bid 4 sp?:)|pg||
nt|kastan88: but 4@H only 3 down|pg||
nt|kastan88: sr even 2 down only|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi I'm Frank from Norway, Welcome also to Geir:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hi Rodal & ty|pg||

nt|ritong: assuming it is not a super forcing one:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ozgull: Burda 4NT briaz karýþýk gibi|pg||

nt|sybarra: 4 @H now? or what?|pg||
nt|frusco: sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can North tell that South has four-card trump support?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure,  does that sound like @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: NE communicating in writing now|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is it all cues?|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@S is cue, but does it SHOW or DENY @S control?:)|pg||
nt|frusco: 4@d?|pg||
nt|sybarra: after the support |pg||
nt|capercliff: bit of a head start for Sweden I see|pg||

mb|5C|nt|ozgull: açýk odada þehmus 3h diyip sonra as sormuþ ortak kantitatif anlamasýn diye|pg||
nt|poohbear: The 5@d save was worth 3 imps against game but it got its huge reward when it forced EW into a minus positon|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: OR playing 5@D by N|pg||
nt|othered1: I assume 3rd best from 4 is their agreement, or is it always 3rd best?|pg||

nt|charles_l: ed spotted it|pg||

nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Thomas|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hi commentators|pg||
nt|tomi2: I always ask myself why 900 kibs come to OR and only 100 to closed|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: probably the name 'closed' is turning them away|pg||
nt|gracelin: normally specs follow the players they know|pg||
nt|tomi2: ok, we have the Norwegian Star Lindqvist playing there, but of course our players here are also top players|pg||
nt|tomi2: in this event they dont start with board 18 so you dont get extra results from altrady played hands|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|rodal f: The web page for the turney: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Brasov.htm|pg||

nt|kaapo: It might be interesting to see, what number of hearts different juniors bid on the East hand|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|gracelin: I understand both Norway and Poland are strong in U26 and did well in the 1st WMSG last Oct.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|charles_l: was a tricky hand|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|rayhaa: in open east preempted 3@c, so easier to find @sQ, but danger for @s 4-1|pg||
nt|rayhaa: west sry|pg||
nt|charles_l: now @d hoping W can ruff?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tomi2: Norway hat an excellent start in this event, but I remember 2 years ago it was the same and they dropped a bit - but I expect they learned from that and will be more concentrated ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: all through this event|pg||
nt|frusco: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: now he needs a miracle in @S and north's play is irrelevant, since he has 3 more black tricks coming|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Gerben42: so maybe E hand is too weak for 2@S?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|davidb: now may make|pg||
nt|charles_l: good try|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|kastan88: and 8 IMPs back to Norway, or N testing East in Dias?, no|pg||
nt|tomi2: now he has 7 points and one was useless, I think east's hand is a bit below minimum for his bid but I can understand his bid|pg||
nt|capercliff: the West hand is an 11 count I would open|pg||
nt|othered1: wrong on that -- low @S is right|pg||
nt|mariner1: well we jinxed it, commentator's curse :(|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|tomi2: Poland was 3rd 2 years ago and 2nd last year in World Championships, Norway 4th in Jesolo and 3rd in Beijing|pg||
nt|tomi2: W could maybe (in case he was sure about partner knowing his spade fit) try 4@H instead of 4NT asking partner to sign off with minimum and bid on with maximum?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I don't agree with the @H discard here by S, decl could still have 4 @H, I think|pg||

mb|p|nt|MolvaM: 24 puanla 3nt. fena deðil|pg||

nt|mariner1: hi Bill|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: not clear they get there|pg||
nt|yuval10: N has a very good cards so i guess he'll bid game|pg||

nt|mdgraham: transfer break?|pg||
nt|othered1: with that opening, there's a chance to stay out, but still one high|pg||
nt|elbec: Di franco passed with an 11 HCPs count even with 2 aces (not following Bava's law). They're very serious about 1nt range (12-14)|pg||
nt|othered1: with rounded suit lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: without an early @c play declarer can set up a pitch in the @d suit|pg||

nt|mariner1: now to make|pg||
pc|h8|nt|waso: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|tomi2: this looks like some 2 way checkbac auction|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2D seems to be a GF chec back or relay|pg||
nt|tomi2: souths 2@D is artifical and gameforcing, says nothing about @D's|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well this seems bullet proof for NS|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 3NT was in fact suggested by a kib|pg||
nt|sybarra: we can refil coffee 's |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Haha, yeah|pg||
nt|poohbear: not exactly a nobrainer 6C could have been bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: no brainer in 3 nt  |pg||
nt|sybarra: but you are right Barry |pg||
nt|poohbear: perhaps. Should that be East's bid? |pg||
nt|tomi2: I like that range, it gives you room in other auctions because there your bids are either NF or GF, like 1@D - 1@S - 2@C - 3@S... you can set a force here without using 4th suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: was that a joke Bas?|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: the players must've heard him/her|pg||
nt|rodal f: Other room roads splitted at 2@C. There 2@D|pg||
nt|gh1: i think is dificult too bid 7 now|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep |pg||
nt|ronpa: I think they play 3@H shows min with 4@H's and 2NT shows the better hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: not many still play 3@h as maxi and 4 card fit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe it s with 5 cards:)|pg||
nt|ritong: threatened with a @c ruff, declarer might go for the trumps and claim 9|pg||
nt|othered1: This should go quickly, if NS can run @C|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to set up K@D for a @S pitch....|pg||
pc|d2|nt|poohbear: need a @c lead or a @s lead and a @c shift|pg||
nt|poohbear: for the defense to prevail|pg||
nt|gracelin: usually it's played over a 1NT rebid, but here they extended to any rebid.|pg||
nt|tomi2: now he will support partnesr spades showing 4 card support and 12+hcp whil a direct jump to 4@S would indicate more shape and less high cards|pg||
nt|gracelin: could beat it with a low H lead |pg||
nt|tomi2: spade bids below 4@S would have been invitational to slam after 2@D|pg||
nt|gracelin: but really tough under the bidding|pg||
nt|tomi2: but after south bid strong and his screenmate even thinks now ot go on maybe east should try some agressive lead|pg||
nt|gracelin: Any other lead will see 4S home|pg||
nt|tomi2: "they are thinking of taking more than 10 tricks and I must hold them to 9 - then I need some miracle"|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mr. Simonsen does not appear to like passing just yet|pg||
nt|gracelin: but it's always the case when opponent bid to a game|pg||
nt|tomi2: does anybody know if N/S are a long time partnership?|pg||
nt|yuval10: probably " i want @h lead"|pg||
pc|sT|nt|syl: the pld rebid problem: 1@d-1@S-? 1444|pg||
nt|rodal f: E are asking in 4NT so exlution gone there|pg||
nt|gh1: stop in 6dia in open|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I think the better bidding is 3diam not 3 clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ended 6@D|pg||
nt|frusco: eheheh |pg||
nt|ritong: he is not at the table|pg||
nt|capercliff: im trying to work out if 6@s can be made|pg||
nt|capercliff: I think it can on a squeeze|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|MolvaM: kör ataðýna zorlanýr mý?|pg||
nt|andy_h: Not that I play it myself, but there's a decent case for playing these 2M jumps as invitational - in that if you have an invitational hand, you don't need to bid 1@S as, if the ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: auction gets competitive, you may need to guess whether to still bid 3@S or not|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would bid 3@d with the E hand, maxi, 4 card fit, doubleton @d|pg||
nt|frusco: the mouse is alive...|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: do U think they know abou diam fit?:)|pg||
nt|xenya: they will|pg||
pc|c3|nt|tomi2: maybe north took 4@S as some splinter bid for either hearts or dias or so? I am just suggesting|pg||
nt|gracelin: As thomas said, south will bid less spades after 2D if he has slam ambition|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 'about'|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why don't E show the @D support?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: when?|pg||
nt|gh1: i think he bid 4dia now|pg||

nt|syl: nope|pg||
nt|waso: only clubs|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: do U think 3clubs is diam support?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|davidb: same bidding same contract in OR|pg||
nt|ozgull: direkt 2NT birþeye tranfer olduðu için böyle yapmak zorunda olsa gerek|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2 kör, 2 karo ve 1 trefl lövesi?|pg||
nt|eerbil: kör ataðý gelse de defans trefl lövesine yetiþemiyor|pg||
nt|gracelin: or north treated 4S as kick-back with Heart agreed ?|pg||
nt|tomi2: zatorski chose the safe way of just raising to 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mr Skjetne is surprised to have the tray returned back empty|pg||
nt|andy_h: One major downside of course, is that you prevent partner from describing the nature of their hand as 2M takes up a lot of room.|pg||
nt|capercliff: N cannot protect both @h and @c, but perhaps he is pitching after dummy|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sonuç olarak bu borddan kaybýmýz olmayacaðýný görmek iyi|pg||
nt|eerbil: oynayan kör as alýnca yerden karo oynayýp 10'lu empasý yapmasý gerek|pg||
nt|ozgull: en azýndan karoyu bilmesi lazým|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|tomi2: because partner did not reverse and they are plying together just this year because Wiankowskis Partner is too old for this event|pg||
pc|s2|nt|poohbear: has an awfully good hand opposite a strong JS|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|poohbear: I prefer 3H|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: no deal|pg||
nt|yuval10: now @h ruff and claim|pg||
nt|mariner1: with a @H lead he can pull 2 trumps and lead @D..... has time to now pitch @S or @c|pg||

nt|mikael_w: and hi cliff|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N was made on 3 in OR -- declarer played @DA, then small to the Q, dropping the Jack|pg||

nt|sybarra: nah  its bridge! |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Who expects to go down 800 and gain 6 IMPs?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I guess the 2 first-round controls made it 1@S, with 6412 I would go 2@H|pg||
nt|mildredb: some really foul breaking suits |pg||
nt|andy_h: Bad breaks for whoever becomes declarer|pg||
nt|tomi2: wonder if South said "thank you partner" when his dummy came down in OR|pg||
nt|henryb: but lead said no stiff club, unless it was led -- and then he could not help it|pg||
nt|athene: and it's possible things might escalate|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kaapo: I think EW play 10-13 1NT when non-vulnerable|pg||
nt|kastan88: if partner has 2 diamond tricks, then this 2@S is down, if not, even @H ducking not better, just easy to count declarer's distribution|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: shitshappening:)|pg||
nt|gh1: Ax in H ig spade lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Near by 3NT but 2 are enough.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not necessarily a quality|pg||
nt|ronpa: I wonder if NS play transfers now|pg||
nt|ronpa: oh they do|pg||
nt|hedyg: so they do|pg||
nt|ronpa: so X = 4+ @H's while 1@H would show @S suit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and also they are good players|pg||
nt|elbec: 3rd position light opening by andrea. 1@d shows 4+@d in an unbalanced hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: 3@c is a " mixed raise " 6-8 points and 4 trumps|pg||
nt|gracelin: now south is stuck with no chance to ask for a club stopper|pg||
nt|tomi2: just bid 3NT and pray :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: a Brave young man will bid 3NT himself.|pg||
nt|sybarra: they dont know that yet|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Exactly|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be laughing in comparison perhaps |pg||
nt|sybarra: or over beers later |pg||

nt|capercliff: hi Mikael|pg||
nt|xenya: not sure that is the right play though -- after 2 rounds of @Cs|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kaapo: They might stop at 3@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|syl: 4h-nice save|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Bogen actually alerted 3@H, Johansen did not...|pg||
nt|sybarra: need to agree with pard whether this bid is asking or telling |pg||
nt|rodal f: A good try also in 3@SNS|pg||

nt|Gerben42: only can E act ?|pg||
nt|tomi2: I have been told there has been a revoke in OR|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@c means " i have a good hand but no convenient bid"|pg||
nt|sybarra: so whats wrong with 2 @H|pg||
nt|ritong: strength|pg||

mb|2N|nt|ozgull: 11 daha çok iyi baþladýk|pg||

nt|sybarra: or just forcing |pg||
nt|mikael_w: I have not have time ro look ar rhe systems, Do E/W play 12-14 nt ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well a sort of phantom save here in 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: good lead .needs 10 only to be a good one better than Sp|pg||
nt|gracelin: he is braver and bid the higher contract|pg||
nt|kastan88: now @D shift?|pg||
nt|gh1: now a x and 3H:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: -1 looks very cheap|pg||
nt|tomi2: and after my p bids 3@S I would not say thank you partner as south!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 3@S was easy to Dbl, maybe a Dbl of 2@H would have been already correct|pg||
nt|ritong: and 3@h tends to show 5|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@H would not give credit to his 18 count|pg||
nt|mdgraham: allows a jump to 3@H to show 5/5 shape at least|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: And how do you bid a 14 HCP 5-4 @S-@C?|pg||
nt|capercliff: can anyone tell me what E/W are playing?|pg||
nt|capercliff: could be precision|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yes, strong @c|pg||
nt|xenya: and 3 imps to Russia on 4, for stopping one level lower|pg||
nt|elbec: enjoy your dinner charles.|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks Charles|pg||
nt|othered1: bye, Charles!|pg||
mb|4S|nt|poohbear: Game is decent but would go down unless declarer could ferret out the offside singleton King|pg||
nt|kaapo: Both major suits are nicely|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|ort21: tx |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@S should deny as many as three hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: S denied 3+ cards in @H i believe|pg||
nt|ritong: personnally i open 2@s|pg||
nt|henryb: I wonder whether 4@d shows a void|pg||
nt|ritong: when east is short in @ds with a good hand, all his features necessarily work good, from west s point of view|pg||
nt|athene: you are right this is a part-score hand, but lots of part-score hands are played in 4@H or above, these days :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: no dbl so might work|pg||
nt|charles_l: many methods - smolen etc to bid to 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: not impossible if he finds out about Souths honors|pg||
nt|sybarra: well whatever works in your system |pg||
nt|ritong: but i do not play gazzilli|pg||
nt|ritong: i play "ritong", modestly lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: but 3 @H to me does not promise 5 |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Di Franco looking rather agitated|pg||
nt|mdgraham: every convention has a price|pg||
mb|p|nt|mildredb: i would play X of 3@D as penalty by west|pg||
nt|andy_h: It's a bit unclear whether E should act over (3@D)-P-(P)-   (I wouldn't) but now the 3@S makes it easier!|pg||
nt|yuval10: some may think that the bidding was switched, but it wasn't...|pg||
nt|gulyas: you have to give up something to gain something|pg||
nt|sybarra: as long as you and pard play same system |pg||
nt|ritong: give up on weak two is not such a big deal|pg||
nt|capercliff: it is im informed, with transfers usually|pg||
nt|ritong: it certainly doesn t henry|pg||
nt|henryb: it could, with 3@d showing a stiff|pg||
nt|ritong: good point|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: I am confident that my former junior partner would have bid 3nt, so I hope he is sitting south in his match :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: but even if south declarered 3NT, West might cash CK then shift to HQ|pg||
nt|gracelin: for the same two down|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mr Sikora has his head on the table now|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: As soon as the @SJ came down Nab thanked :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think I would lead a club in this auction, trying to get "natural" tricks first|pg||
nt|Gerben42: as I said, I would dbl 2@H|pg||
nt|Gerben42: after that, the party starts :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: as EW play mini-NT |pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is comfy - take a club ruff in dummy |pg||
nt|mikael_w: But even whith strong @c E:s hand sure look like a NT-opening |pg||
nt|elbec: nice contract by manno di franco|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kastan88: yeah, it is easy to say here, if we can see all hands, not easy to find right switch for West|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Good X, 4@S should go off a few|pg||
nt|sybarra: think so |pg||
nt|yuval10: and yet another disaster for Sweden in the OR|pg||
nt|hedyg: this should make nicely|pg||
nt|henryb: but no; 6@d showed the void|pg||
nt|henryb: I think a @s lead beats 7|pg||
nt|othered1: and not very aggressive bidding by west.|pg||
nt|elbec: EW could make 10 tricks in @h|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gracelin: bidding was wierd in closed room.  North opened 2C and NS stopped in 4D.|pg||
nt|ritong: also, you can have multi 2@d and 2@c for any strong hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: it is a good treatment to play 1M-1NT-2NT as forcing to game, with 54, or 6+ in your main suit, and jump shifts showing 55 and also GF|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nice bidding|pg||
pc|h3|nt|MolvaM: arda ve erdem bu elden 11 kazanacaklarýný düþünmüyordur herhalde.|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Don't agree with 4@S btw|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|gracelin: I meant in ope room|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C was for both majors weak|pg||
nt|tomi2: sinche they bid 3 suits and my partner also I think club is the one I can expect to get most|pg||
nt|ritong: o_0?|pg||
nt|henryb: 7@h surely|pg||
nt|henryb: this was well bid|pg||
nt|ritong: not dow<n yet|pg||
nt|henryb: operator; 7@d is a very unlikely bid|pg||
pc|s2|nt|poohbear: South should try to conceal honors by winning the Ace of ! and returning the Q|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: N bid 1H with 3 cards. Maybe is transfer for spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I lie:)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|poohbear: @cs|pg||
nt|kaapo: So there isn't much in the play|pg||
nt|hedyg: just ruff it!|pg||
nt|charles_l: potential loser in each suit|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|sybarra: Stafie's pard opened the bidding and he has good hand with K of @S,   and will look for signal for entry |pg||
nt|tomi2: hope W will not play @SA|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes looks like it would qualify for a 14-16|pg||
nt|ritong: but if declarer tries to join his hand via @c J...|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder if @H back might not have been more effective.  Now just play @D|pg||
nt|othered1: Take 8 tricks. losing only 3@S (regardless split) and two rounded|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Sandra has left to procure drinks (barefooted)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yuval10: i'm not sure what was the 1@h overcall by N in the OR, a psych possible, over 1@c strong when P is passed hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|henryb: white lie. now relatively easy: @d ruff, @s, @d ruff @hQ, @sA, draw trumps and claim|pg||
nt|athene: both north and south are maximum for passing over 4@H, i think|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: sorry She |pg||
nt|rodal f: Home if J@C are to be found|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Gerben42: Tomi he played before :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it backfired big time|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|kastan88: now @D|pg||
nt|tomi2: last week I pinned two singleton honors with my partners, I am expert in this :)|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|Gerben42: 300 extra now :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think it was a psych,hence S's 2@h|pg||
nt|rayhaa: had to duck @d Q to have a chance for 11|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|poohbear: Declarer has seen 12 points in south. If he sees the QJ of @h or if he sees no overuff in @ds then he prob gets it right|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thinking|pg||
nt|poohbear: On the previous 2 boards Russia scored 7 then 12|pg||
nt|gh1: and -1|pg||
nt|gulyas: gazilli fills another gap, where you are 16-18(19), and try to figure out what and how high to play (2@D usually shows 8+, and sets a GF)|pg||
nt|henryb: to explain the auction: 4N was "Roman key card blackwood", 5@c showed one or four of the 5 keys, 5@d asked about the @hQ, 6@d said "I've got that and a surprise in @d|pg||
nt|xenya: apparently W couldn't raise 1@H as that would show a strong hand, and he was reluctant to go the three level later |pg||
pc|h2|nt|poohbear: yes terrible holding in everysuit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: S should play another @H now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphztr: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=734&qroundno=12&qshowflag=1|pg||

nt|ritong: with south|pg||
pc|d8|nt|poohbear: declarer needs to be careful here|pg||

pc|s8|nt|mildredb: y, 1100 in the bank is a nice cushion|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: I think 3@S was an overbid too, for that matter|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S EW looks right here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mariner1: hi all, in from the Open|pg||
nt|waso: 5c  -1|pg||
nt|hedyg: slam time|pg||
nt|henryb: and only if South has them|pg||
nt|ritong: however, the "bad spiral" we talked about previously seems to get in place|pg||
mb|d|nt|davidb: great  grand ! but not easy to reach even 6 .perfect fit. void vs o points|pg||
nt|tomi2: watching the other results on hand 5 you see some could stop in 2@S or 3@D and did not get doubled, only 3@S and upwards got punished|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think nobody was going to double 3@D here too|pg||
nt|hedyg: bergen raise|pg||
nt|ronpa: 3@C is 6-9 and 4@S's, and he has to be carefull|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: they dont explain|pg||
nt|hedyg: slam is down on A@d and @d|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: only alert|pg||
nt|hedyg: they are right, only explain if asked|pg||
nt|ronpa: Bar might try 3@H now and padon will accept with 4@D, this might lead to slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: multi  wk in one major |pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@h would be the best contract normally|pg||
nt|athene: yes, north can show diamonds but east will just bid quite a lot of spades|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S leads might cause a problem|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|mariner1: 4@H and 3N makes EW with a few correct guesses|pg||
nt|mariner1: Q@H and Q@S right, along with the Aces|pg||
nt|waso: 5c=|pg||
nt|syl: why -1|pg||
nt|waso: 6c|pg||
nt|waso: 6c -1   |pg||
nt|waso: 5c=|pg||
nt|syl: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: srry Bar is thinking not Cicek|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bar= Tarnovski|pg||
nt|arigun: @d lead will not be too difficult|pg||
nt|athene: and west will raise that to quite a lot more spades|pg||
nt|pelu: no 2@D (or 2@H) here from East = both majors - it a convention from Norway (Ekren)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kaapo: 6@D on board 3 has was bid 5 times out of 20|pg||
nt|poohbear: u mean 3@h?|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think thats ok|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: OR playing same contract previous board|pg||
nt|sybarra: is S thinking of a splinter?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure about 4@D - reckon that should show the ace|pg||
nt|ronpa: 4@D just says I accept invitation and have a good hand|pg||
nt|ronpa: he will bid 3@S with min and 4@S is medium hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of a funky multi |pg||
nt|mdgraham: good defence is to play double as 13-15 approx or any 20+|pg||
nt|sybarra: S hand is really a bunch of junk |pg||
nt|mikael_w: 5@c seems to be a decent contract|pg||
nt|elbec: let's see what happens now? would the bidding finish?|pg||
nt|athene: normally a 5-5 shape is very powerful if you have a known fit|pg||
nt|athene: but here, east goes a little more cautiously|pg||
nt|athene: having the 1@H bid over him is very bad|pg||
nt|athene: it means, not only are the hearts useless as a trick source|pg||
nt|athene: but it will be hard to ruff them in dummy without getting over-ruffs|pg||
nt|mariner1: I guess @S leads do not work either as N does not have enough entries to lead more|pg||
nt|mariner1: than 2 times|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: 3NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: will see|pg||
nt|waso: i dont believe east will pass|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ..|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 4H?|pg||
nt|waso: east will play the hand  5c  or 6c  |pg||
nt|syl: what about 5@C in 1. seat|pg||
nt|kaapo: *was bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: J@C was found? Adrian|pg||
nt|mdgraham: kind of Last Train, then|pg||
nt|hedyg: Ozturk woke up|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no diamond lead now...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bit late for that, really|pg||
nt|ronpa: this hand is super maximum, also Q@H looks good after 3@H bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure @d lead still|pg||
nt|xenya: an awkward hand for natural methods|pg||
nt|charles_l: EW must find game here|pg||
nt|rayhaa: makes on @d finesse|pg||
nt|charles_l: @cA in S too|pg||
mb|4H|nt|poohbear: I believe Ruso should bid to define her hand once partner responds. I would bid 2@c'|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: she bid 3diam|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: not good|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 5clubs in 1st seat|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe without the ace of diam|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2 pairs collected 1100 defending against 2@HX|pg||
nt|kastan88: occasionally West @D was 32, so was difficult to East assume, that partner 2 is from doubleton, probably Jxx|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D shows 5+ cards (if bal 12-14) or 4+ unbal in their system|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then North can get into the act and SOuht won't have this guess as to whether to re-open or not|pg||
nt|gulyas: any gazilli experts in the audience? I was asked what you do with 5@S-4@C wk (my guess was 2@D showing either minor)|pg||
nt|capercliff: both contract have bad breaks|pg||
nt|mikael_w: but whith this layout in @c it will be tough offcurse|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: OK:)|pg||
nt|mildredb: probably 7 back now|pg||
nt|hedyg: S is on lead|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep but ruff?|pg||
nt|ronpa: other table bid the slam and @D was led so chance for another big pickup for Israel|pg||
nt|ritong: poor sikora must be muttering some black polish just now|pg||
nt|henryb: At the other table the Norwegian pair managed to go 3 down in 6@h|pg||
nt|elbec: unusual or natural 2nt?|pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder what 2N is -- just natural?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: me too:)|pg||
nt|ozgull: þehmus ile güney tahmin ediyorum þu anda çok moralliler|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D for me is an underbid but it works out well here|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3N of course is rigid|pg||
nt|henryb: sorry, the dutch pair.|pg||
nt|ritong: we had translated:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe its a mistake or a lie from operator:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no alert for 2nt|pg||
nt|othered1: If east had extras, 3@H would be attractive here, but the double really didn't help EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: but she lead a club|pg||
nt|syl: @d trap may avoided.|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hanna gabor thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I think she dont like 3sp bid|pg||
nt|syl: 3@H rebid would have been the simplest|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep she have right hand on the head|pg||
nt|yuval10: making 10 tricks in @s is a lot...|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h looks like going down|pg||
nt|yuval10: N has to play @d after he wins the first @s|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: too many conventional bidding for Sweden ... I think...|pg||
nt|ritong: how so, "wk"?|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, 12-14, say|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 11-14, I s'pose|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is probably not the first time W has played in his singleton trump suit in hand |pg||
nt|mikael_w: ohh my, the result from OR will not be easy to match here|pg||
nt|capercliff: duck a @s and W is dead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: well W must not have realized the 2@S was a game try here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bazý çiftler kontrdan sonraki koz tutuþlarýný göstermek için transferli deklareler oynuyorlar|pg||
nt|eerbil: Arda'nýn kontrdan sonra eðer transfer oynuyorlarsa iyi kör yükseltmesi anlamýnda 2@d demesi daha iyi olurdu|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: aie|pg||
nt|syl: 5@C NOW|pg||
nt|gracelin: with those weak spots, I would not be interested to penalize opponents in 2D, so would Cue 3D instead.|pg||
nt|kaapo: However, all tabes should find a slam here|pg||
nt|kaapo: North would now like to ask for aces outside of spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully landing in a safe 4 @H now |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Never mind, 4@CX lol|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: srry was my mistake:(|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 3 NT DBL|pg||
nt|athene: @HA or @CQ lead both set up marked finesses|pg||
nt|athene: either a normal club finesse or a ruffing heart finesse|pg||
pc|hA|nt|raghavan: Hello, I am Ragavan from chennai of India |pg||
nt|mariner1: I would have bid 3N over the 2@S,,, showing my minor cards|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: !|pg||
nt|MolvaM: muhtemelen arda ciçek bu konv oynamýyor|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes|pg||
nt|tomi2: my partner will never play me for support and 3 aces, maybe he will even pass 2@D|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not the best dession from N. Will cost some IMPs|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: let's see|pg||
nt|capercliff: E will double this|pg||
nt|capercliff: and S might just pull to 5@c|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, W is dead, nut not easy to find 10 tricks anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: so better not cash the @d K now, although i find it very difficult|pg||
nt|henryb: took a short break to watch the sprint finish of today's Tour stage|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure about their signals|pg||
nt|henryb: won again by Mark Cavendish|pg||
nt|elbec: meanwhile 11 more mps to italy thanks to 4@h made|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphztr: srry 4 undo|pg||
nt|waso: now  4h   5c|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: let see.....|pg||
nt|ronpa: south did his part of the job now all up to north|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mariner1: I wonder if W thought they were showing a constructive raise of 2@H and E missed|pg||
nt|mariner1: it?|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=3&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|mariner1: -  Running Scores (refresh often)|pg||
nt|gulyas: OK, I am told 2@C is EITHER 16+, or natural|pg||
nt|ritong: if you adopt 2M openings as showing M+@c, you have to give up on natural weak 2 or two suited 2M openings, that is clear|pg||
nt|athene: an amusing symmetrical position in the red suits|pg||
nt|athene: stiff Q, J109 opposite and a ruffing finesse potential|pg||
nt|athene: and findable too on the bidding|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes the ruffing finesse in @H should be all he needs|pg||
nt|athene: yes, absolutely no problem coming to eleven tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphztr: 4sp?!|pg||
nt|ronpa: bar will play the 8|pg||
nt|othered1: This auction sounds like one you might double|pg||
pc|c7|nt|MolvaM: veya arda elini beðenmedi.  demek arda'ya daha iyi eller geliyormuþ|pg||
nt|eerbil: kuzey'in deklaresini anlamak gerçekten güç, 2.kontr ile zaten gücünü belirtmiþti|pg||
nt|MolvaM: evet özgür bakanýn dediði gibi belki de 2@h = iyisi   dir|pg||
nt|hedyg: 8@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: wd|pg||
nt|hedyg: and now?|pg||
nt|capercliff: note the 1@s overcall|pg||
nt|ritong: no fun:)|pg||
nt|xenya: EW's bidding was not very convincing, to say the least|pg||
nt|othered1: Personally, I think west hand didn't merit action over 3@S.  Before that just tough.|pg||
nt|elbec: lead from the longest suit and 6 tricks arriving for the defence|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: passsssssssssssssssssss   south |pg||
nt|sybarra: your hand didnt get any better|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok, South has a 13-count....but if you pass you will face this "re-open or not" guess every time|pg||
nt|ritong: 2M openings = M+@cs, medium|pg||
nt|capercliff: most would hammer away with 2,3, or even 4@s opposite a passed partner|pg||
nt|othered1: But lucky for North, who had no guarantee @S weren't running with one loser, to find @C J in south|pg||
nt|elbec: but di franco need to duck with its king of heart|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can draw three rounds of trumps and take the ruffing finesse in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: and then south gets squeezed in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|athene: that's one possibility|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphztr: How can he go on without a @S control?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|raghavan: Tx|pg||
nt|waso: no idea whats 4sp   but im sure   it was the only bid to make east bid 6c|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: anyway the Director Mr. Dumitrasciuc is here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: called by Chaugny|pg||
nt|syl: maybe sort of answer|pg||
nt|waso: i've been told that 4c is  RKCB|pg||
nt|waso: so 4sp shows 2|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep 4 spade was answer for aces:)|pg||
nt|waso: another 12 imps 4 France|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: the director is still here|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer might escape now|pg||
nt|ronpa: good try but not enough|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphztr: good lead:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 4 hungary:)|pg||
nt|syl: pseudo endplay against N?|pg||
nt|gracelin: indeed, and if south CJ were CK, we would miss a cold 6H|pg||
nt|sybarra: and no one (like pard) cued the @S |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mariner1: right click my name JOIN|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: only one club|pg||
nt|yuval10: if S plays a @s though....|pg||
nt|yuval10: @s / @d defeat the contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: S must know that E has 2@c's|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kaapo: 4NT would not be a great idea, because if partner responds 1 key card, you cannot tell if it's the @SA or the @CK|pg||
nt|ritong: did ushovdt finish well?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: youthful exuberance? |pg||
nt|rodal f: Need to cover |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: she's trying to catch something?|pg||
nt|gh1: was a strange x with AQJ in H|pg||
pc|s6|nt|prasenjit1: ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: needs ace and spade to beat it |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Heya Prasenjit|pg||
nt|sybarra: and this works |pg||
nt|rayhaa: only challenge wld been a @s lead and @h 4-1|pg||
pc|c6|nt|davidb: N do not have an easy bid . 5 can be overboard.|pg||
nt|ozgull: ingilizler de bir önceki maç irlanda yý yendiði için biraz rahatlýk var gibi:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: her 2 masada da ingilizlerin oynayýp batmasý iyi midir sayýn yorumcular?  :)|pg||
nt|mildredb: misspoke - probably 7 more for Germany|pg||
nt|elbec: nice duck|pg||
pc|cA|nt|raghavan: Declarer has to give a Spade and a Diamond |pg||
nt|kastan88: 1st push in this match|pg||
nt|othered1: I think declarer's now out for -1|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: Welcome  Prasenjit|pg||
nt|yuval10: and he did well, and now there's no entry for dummy's @s's|pg||
nt|mariner1: he can hold his losses to 2 @H and a @D|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|hedyg: OR played 2@d, easier there|pg||
nt|capercliff: im surprised S decided to play 4@h actually|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like it|pg||
nt|elbec: only if di franco cashes now ace of spades|pg||
nt|elbec: other wise ace of heart, diamond to the jack and 9 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess if he ducks he can have later exit problems|pg||
nt|ort21: someone have live result?|pg||
nt|athene: now the clubs are blocked for the squeeze on south|pg||
nt|rayhaa: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qshowflag=1   Running scores|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: so he needs the ruffing finesse in diamonds for the 11th|pg||
pc|s8|nt|eerbil: 5 imp kadar iyi :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|gulyas: so you rebid 2@C with a wk 54, then bid 2@S over 2@D to show the wk hand type|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@c ambiguous is gazzilli, and is the reason i moderately appreciate it, since it is not that easy to handle|pg||
nt|begse: can make by endplaying|pg||
nt|begse: he seems to be on the right way|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ruff 2 spades and diam|pg||
nt|henryb: tailed off; Tyler Farrat, the young American, finished second|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=17&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|ritong: so cav in green again, rite?|pg||
nt|henryb: yep, with I think about a 10 or 15 point margin|pg||
nt|charles_l: but 3x@d allows @s pitch before trum;ps drawn (i think)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mariner1: Welcome Mike Gold|pg||
pc|sA|nt|raghavan: will be 1 down|pg||
nt|charles_l: hi rag|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Mike|pg||
nt|Gerben42: i would expect a bit more for 3@D, but that's just me...|pg||
nt|capercliff: south would have liked to play small from dummy there, but there are entry problems|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think S here shod have understand why W let E to be on the lead, big chanse he has void @d. E Dbl @d bid in the bidding|pg||
nt|mikael_w: But if he plays @c now that trick might come back|pg||

nt|lestergold: hi Rob hi specs hi all|pg||
nt|begse: cant now|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mistake|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|capercliff: each undertrick doesnt cost that much as it happens, but declarer doesnt know that|pg||
nt|xenya: good defence|pg||
nt|elbec: yes|pg||
nt|elbec: this is what we call a razor stroke :) everything perfect by north|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|sybarra: I think E expected the K of @S in dummy |pg||
nt|xenya: now W has to cash the high spades, then endplay N with a club for 1 off|pg||
nt|othered1: a lot easier had south found @CJ at trick 1, fairly clear after double, I'd think|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nice play Ekaterina|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: Looks like a 9er and 3 IMP for Russia|pg||
nt|othered1: but west may play north shorter in @S for the double|pg||

pc|d5|nt|yuval10: and the Italian blitz continue|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Fellus said: "scuza Giuseppe" :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: for the 5 of diamond|pg||

nt|charles_l: picked up an imp|pg||
nt|rayhaa: next round is France - Norway, and just now Norway i 2nd is 14VP behind France|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Russia had best begin to turn this critical match around soon.|pg||
nt|athene: i see it's a 4major theme match so far :) |pg||
mb|1D|nt|mariner1: interesting cards breaks here|pg||
nt|kastan88: Running scores for Open class: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=8&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice club suits being dealt today |pg||
nt|andy_h: Conflicting factors now with N's hand|pg||
nt|Gerben42: this hand is tricky in 2/1, you have to decide if this is GF or inv. before seeing partners 2@D rebid|pg||
nt|andy_h: Positives: Good 5card suit, QT9 (good) support and a singleton.  Negatives: Singleton King and only 3 trumps|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would bid some kind of systematic bid that does not allow my partner to pass before game is reached and try to show my hearts too|pg||
nt|Gerben42: you mean 2@H :)|pg||
nt|henryb: will tell you shortly|pg||
mb|d|nt|tomi2: so I start with 2@H and bid 4@S later|pg||
nt|yuval10: costs 2 imps.... +7 instead +9|pg||
nt|elbec: and third live place for Italy|pg||
nt|elbec: manno will show a balanced game forcing hand|pg||
nt|charles_l: do you dbl or 2@c with |pg||
nt|charles_l: N?|pg||
mb|r|nt|charles_l: looks like some excitement|pg||
nt|raghavan: a slam hand - let us enjoy how they reach slam and make|pg||
nt|babydolldk: Nice slam with A @H onside|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h is normal here but the breaks are really cruel|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@C could be a 18-19 NT|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mariner1: 4@S best NS spot|pg||
mb|2D|nt|gracelin: bery rare to see a passed out board in youth eent.  They get matured|pg||
nt|gracelin: very|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps NS bid another 3NT here?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Although it might not be that great on a @C lead|pg||
nt|ritong: quiet auction|pg||
nt|ritong: 3NT has play, to say the least|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that seems increasingly popular these days|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gulyas: well, we know the basics|pg||
nt|mariner1: how does E take that DBL?|pg||
nt|rayhaa: i bid 2@c and hope to get a chance to show @s|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mariner1: 1@C is Polish @c|pg||
nt|lestergold: only making game for n/s 4s tho 5dims can be let thru|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maçlar 20 boardluk|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1D probably showed H, and 2H confirmed 4-card support|pg||
nt|gracelin: With half his honors in opponents' suit, south better contend with 3H or a try|pg||
nt|kastan88: after 1@S vuln from West, how many points in @S will put North into partner's hand?|pg||
nt|tomi2: now south solved noth's problem :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: will someone crack this one?|pg||
nt|capercliff: E/W can make 5@d here double dummy|pg||
nt|elbec: "Whist" bidding for manno|pg||
nt|charles_l: me too. i definitely prefer pd to lead @cs|pg||
mb|3S|nt|charles_l: W maybe should bid 3@c over XX?|pg||
nt|babydolldk: Unless you lead a @H 6@D is only 1100 v. 1370:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: This is a forcing Pass by E|pg||
nt|ozgull: bu arada girls romanya ya karþý 30 - 5 önde|pg||
nt|rodal f: If N was active now|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if 2NT could be GF also, seems like 4@S kills a lot of space|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, south has a decent hand if partner wants to investigate slam|pg||
mb|4H|nt|poohbear: I think 2C may be either natural or a balanced GF|pg||
nt|kastan88: test time now: what is meaning of pass over 2@S doubled|pg||
nt|rayhaa: dont u want opps to pass out 3@h with south hand?|pg||
nt|charles_l: yes i would love them to|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well south having shown his spades first presumably this will be played in spades now|pg||
nt|eerbil: sanýrsam bu elden kaybedeceðiz|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu elde karo pozisyonu nedeni ile þlem sorunsuz|pg||
nt|begse: sanslý bi slem |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT too much if they open this light|pg||
nt|ronpa: 3NT and 3@D both can be defeated|pg||
mb|p|nt|begse: gitmemek hatta 5 e cýkmamak lazým|pg||
nt|syl: wrong sided so|pg||
nt|syl: may even fail|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 1NT from Aurelie!!!:)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Board 6 is at the moment recorded as round pass in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: a director asked to look at my movie and went to check|pg||
nt|kaapo: That shuold be fixed soon, when they actually play the board|pg||
nt|Walddk4: On a diamond lead you can make it on cross-ruff, but it requires that you cash clubs first. So you need clubs to break|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you play a second diamond like declarer did in the other room, South will pitch a club and you go down|pg||
nt|yuval10: def. will play trumps after Q@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: and then after 2nd @d S can ruff and play trumps again|pg||
nt|yuval10: will it matters?|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@Hx was t/o, and the rest is automatic:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: cant argue with the bidding |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: nope|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh well, also missed the 4@S, tough hand to land right|pg||
nt|mariner1: I guess 5@S can make too though|pg||
nt|lestergold: after 4d it wa surely correct fopr north to give preference to spades he had al reay bid the pips off a 6 card heart suit with poor intermediates|pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure that is possible either|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a lost opportunity for a swing here unless north 'corrects' to spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe 2 clubs is checkback|pg||
nt|kastan88: and that's it, if partner not having any points in spades, where are his 12 points for opening?, still could ask for aces, IMO|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Lauks and the two aces from his hand:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and he said: one down will be enough|pg||
nt|rodal f: Should become a flat board by normal defence|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|capercliff: and 4@h is very close as well with @h 3-3|pg||
nt|capercliff: actually the same 11 tricks are available in both suits|pg||
nt|mikael_w: the problem is that in 4@h you have NO entry to dummy|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mariner1: in Open Room S bid @S twice and they still did not get to 4@S|pg||
nt|gracelin: a spade lead, club shift and duck, will beat even 3H|pg||
nt|kastan88: here is clear, that NS  have not the same pinion about pass over 2@S doubled from South hand. But such situations need to agree exactly. showing this 1 stopper or half stopper or ...|pg||
nt|kastan88: nothin in spades, or just minimum hand whatever, but agreement needed|pg||
pc|c2|nt|charles_l: its pretty much 16+ with @c, what he has|pg||
nt|gracelin: This maximum defense is in fact a reasonable one|pg||
nt|kaapo: On this lead, EW could keep South out of his hand|pg||
nt|kastan88: sr for mistyping. opinion , not pinion :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: with trumps 4-1, he cannot get his @Ds good and enjoy them too|pg||
nt|gulyas: in the meantime, Hungarian schoolkids are running riot against France (41-0 so far), and leading the pack! Making me very proud:)|pg||
nt|ritong: are you coaching them, daniel?|pg||
nt|gulyas: no, just rooting for them:)|pg||
nt|ritong: oki:)|pg||
nt|charles_l: E should bid 1@h not XX, just in case it comes back at the 3/4@s level|pg||
pc|cA|nt|charles_l: (assuming polish @c)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Not much excitement - only they have not reached a makeable C slam|pg||
nt|mariner1: a none @c lead allows a make|pg||
nt|mariner1: non|pg||
nt|lestergold: now Jones ha to find the killing club lead |pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@s will not fare well\|pg||
nt|kaapo: But @Hs are splitting, too|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@C looks like conventional stayman|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H shows @S|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: interesting|pg||
nt|mikael_w: play the @dK from hand is a little to much double dummy I think|pg||
nt|athene: Smolen over 2NT is something you lose if you play puppet|pg||
nt|mariner1: pass??|pg||
nt|athene: but it is quite valuable|pg||
nt|pelu: ????|pg||
nt|mariner1: surely S did not pass|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: and he has|pg||
nt|poohbear: even with that lead not much declarer can do to avoid going 2 off|pg||
nt|poohbear: Best to win in Dummy and play a @c to try to negotiate a ruff|pg||
nt|poohbear: alternatively if you trust the lead you can draw trumps and if 3-2 play for 4 @d tricks and then lead a @c off dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Mr. Brian Senior is here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: making pictures|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: this is a jr event!|pg||
nt|poohbear: not a senior moment :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might gain some IMPs again for Russia. @H lead? Seemed normal for me!|pg||
nt|ronpa: other room in 3@H which is also a tough contract|pg||
nt|charles_l: XX to me shows defending interest|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yuval10: i guess not, as you take 6@h, 3@c, 1@d|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: well all the other uits have been bid naturally|pg||
nt|lestergold: falase card will not fool ed|pg||
nt|Gerben42: apparently 2NT cannot be a "good GF"|pg||
nt|yuval10: S would've done better to let N takes the trick and play Q@d|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Sandra is thinking|pg||
nt|yuval10: take in dummy, @c to J, ruff @s....etc|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: is not easy...|pg||
nt|yuval10: nothing is...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: sorry|pg||
nt|mariner1: aha :)|pg||
nt|pelu: ok|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|MolvaM: diðer masada 2keycard cevabýný neden yetersiz görmüþ acaba güney?|pg||
nt|mariner1: np :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|MolvaM: keycard soran adam, eðer eksik yoksa þlemi söylemeli bence|pg||
nt|syl: @H" can mislead pd|pg||
nt|gracelin: the duck is the more difficult part|pg||
nt|gracelin: now declarer is safe|pg||
nt|tomi2: taking the ace and then thinking about the situation is not the best solution|pg||
nt|tomi2: he actually does not need much more then norths hand to have a good @D slam for example|pg||
nt|henryb: indeed. but North has a very lucky hand for South: sixth club, heart help and the @dQJ to help get the ninth trick|pg||
pc|s3|nt|begse: ama nezaman soracagýnýda bilmeli)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: evet :) cümlenin devamýnda da ..... ya da hiç sormamalý demeliydim herhalde|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|eerbil: Ingilizler çok yukardan konuþmalarýnýn sonucunu bu elde artý olarak aldýlar|pg||
nt|MolvaM: iyi de bu elde þleme gitmek pek "yukardan konuþma" deðil bence|pg||
nt|ritong: gling|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: so apush|pg||
nt|syl: *2|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Funfact, one of the Dutch girls players is also a member of our U21 team. However, obviously she's not playing now :)|pg||
nt|athene: this will play quite nicely, even though the black-suit breaks look nasty at first|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 - 1 @S are a problem however has play|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|waso: so hungary missed a 12 imp chance|pg||
nt|syl: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Wonder why he didn't play @HQ...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Kibs saying @HK and then the J shows the Q, but Sikora isn't so sure, he's held the @S2 two times already|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes, but in @h you are likely to get a @d lead|pg||
pc|h5|nt|davidb: needs a H to defeat it |pg||
nt|tomi2: I guess just in this moment Nawrocki realizes that he made a mistake|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: good defence?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 3 down... I think|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gh1: must ruff with a or q no fore -1|pg||
nt|sybarra: back to the hungarian kids,  I think they have been stars so far |pg||
pc|hT|nt|tomi2: same in Germany|pg||
nt|tomi2: Marie Eggeling will join the Schools team tomorrow|pg||
nt|xenya: not cleasr how he can make it -- possibly 2 down|pg||
nt|othered1: That @S loser is probably the second setting trick|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can come to ten or eleven tricks in various ways i think|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H should be -1 but might make|pg||
nt|arigun: 3@h is too much to me if 3@d is not forcing|pg||
nt|ronpa: now he has to find the club shift|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|gracelin: he is also afraid of thinking before ducking to expose his CA and create tempo problem when partner get in later.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|raghavan: Hello Anita - can u enkighten us as to what system they are playing here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: neyse. giden 13 imp|pg||
nt|ritong: better play a trump now|pg||
nt|capercliff: and N can get 2 ruffs|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ritong: @d obv gives it  when a @c allows a cross ruff|pg||
nt|ritong: probably his problem was " a trump, ok, but which one"|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|hedyg: after 1 @s everything was too much for me|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yuval10: this will work, too |pg||

nt|mariner1: (Click on ones with NO x)|pg||
nt|elbec: king of club ducked|pg||
nt|athene: leading clubs from dummy means that if west ruffs, he is ruffing a loser with his trump trick|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|hedyg: both 2NT and 3@H|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ozgull: ilginç|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphztr: simonsen need only the Ace of H|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: good defense   here |pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps was safer to cash K@c before the @s, but it won't matter here|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Rather strange @DJ by W|pg||

nt|kastan88: but same thing happened in Open Room, after both opps showed spades, North couldn't believe partner is without 2 aces...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did u know that: Albania are 120 people at there federation, while Turkey are 1.050.000 members?|pg||
nt|gh1: A Roland slm here make with a dia lead:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Romania: 500-1000 members|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @S+m apparently|pg||
nt|tomi2: let's see if they find their @H fit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Muiderberg used against a Dutch pair, the irony :)|pg||
nt|ronpa: a very agressive opening with 7-4 with a major but might work well here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I like this boys|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@H here is a @S transfer|pg||
nt|mariner1: S wondering where all the bidding is coming from|pg||
nt|athene: there are so many transfers used these days i think any regular partnership needs some generic agreements|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: a trump lead here is best vs @H|pg||
nt|eerbil: açanýn karo kontrolü olmadýðýný ve dengeli eli olduðunu bilirken iyi bir þlem deðil bence|pg||
nt|gh1: or spade J|pg||
nt|yuval10: OR i guess natural 1NT opening and all pass|pg||
nt|yuval10: a different story here though|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Less than an IMP per board is little by U26 standards :)|pg||
nt|athene: the basic thing you have to discuss is:-|pg||
nt|rayhaa: 6@s is 50%|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lestergold: clubs lie badly too many losers in the black s in east's hand to be dealt with bearing in mind a 3/1 rump break|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am glad to see people can still double for penalty, eapecially by the youth.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 nt =weak with both minors |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Not a very useful convention in my opinion|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some 700 I belive Adrian|pg||
nt|tomi2: thats not exactly muiderberg|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@H is both majors weak for our pair too|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 3NT is probably a maximum with @D as sidesuit|pg||
nt|tomi2: while 2@C shows @H and another suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South wants to double, you can feel it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed|pg||
nt|ritong: ambitious|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: *an IMP|pg||
nt|athene: if you double a transfer is it showing the suit bid, or is it t/o of the promised suit?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Mikael Westerlund|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: E  does not like XXX in Spades ..|pg||
nt|lestergold: and over ruff threats in dims|pg||
nt|poohbear: another competitive battle at the game level here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Now, is South's double for penalty?|pg||
nt|elbec: aggressive bidding by di franco|pg||
nt|mariner1: everyone in auction should be a warning to everyone :)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|charles_l: normal to be in 4@h down here|pg||
nt|charles_l: esp at imps|pg||
nt|raghavan: If they do not cash D - 4H makes = 1 Spade loser+1H+1D( 1 Diamond goes in Clubs|pg||
nt|mariner1: well they should be warned about the breaks now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: goodness, 5@c |pg||
nt|ronpa: east wants to X 5@C|pg||
nt|capercliff: do well to stay low here|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. is south's double here hearts, or t/o of spades?|pg||
nt|athene: of course, these two meanings overlap to an extent|pg||
nt|athene: but it's important to discuss them i think|pg||
nt|mariner1: now we see if S believes everyone|pg||
nt|pelu: the standard are: X of a conventional bid = the suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|MolvaM: bu kontr negatif sanýrým ama tutulsa fena olmaz|pg||
nt|tomi2: nice play by west in the open room for 3nt=|pg||
nt|kastan88: still correct was to use somewhere blackwood type bid|pg||
nt|vugraphztr:   NT = pass or correct|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 3NT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: only pass possible response... 3NT wont have problems|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: According to E, 3NT showed a 4-card, however, I could not deduct which|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohoh!|pg||
nt|othered1: north bids 3@H and south passes?|pg||
nt|elbec: after inital pass...|pg||
nt|othered1: That feels like a deep view, even with possible @S duplication|pg||
nt|elbec: he is probabli thinking that they could have mirror like hands|pg||
nt|othered1: but it's right on this hand|pg||
nt|xenya: well he can't quite raise to 4@H after N's initial pass?|pg||
nt|rayhaa: will bid it too|pg||
mb|5D|nt|hedyg: getting to 3NT|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D was natural, most of the time with 5 cards|pg||
nt|kaapo: I like to play that way|pg||
nt|sybarra: has its moments  |pg||
nt|tomi2: If there are any kids (below 18 years) watching this vugraph, I must warn you not to watch open room's auction and play in the next board|pg||
nt|Gerben42: helpful lead|pg||
nt|Gerben42: can make 5@H 5@S 3@D now|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: !!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|hedyg: he had 1 chance to beat it, which was pass|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nice table!!!|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3@h is par|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: the question if 3H shows shape as well or can be x H |pg||
nt|ronpa: he still didnt make it, he has to play very carefully|pg||
nt|hedyg: why double? for 100 instead of 50?|pg||
nt|ritong: starting with @c A, u never know|pg||
nt|henryb: Hushovd finished 5th|pg||
nt|athene: one school of thought says that you have a convenient cue-bid available as a t/o double, so X should just show the suit bid|pg||
mb|6S|nt|babydolldk: Yes, maybe difficult for w to play a @D...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: E not happy with partner's bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: in open  east bid 5h in front of partner against 5dims partner may have found a different action|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=2|pg||
nt|mariner1: -  Leaders|pg||
nt|poohbear: once again we see Ruso fail to bid at a cheap level|pg||
nt|poohbear: not clear this Dbl will excite partner enuff|pg||
nt|kaapo: Mostly to expose psychs like this 1@S by Arvidsson|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: expose he did. find the right level he didnt|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Ouch|pg||
nt|sybarra: I play it with a european pard |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: This is going to be bloody|pg||
nt|arigun: possible to make 5@c |pg||
nt|ritong: nice spot|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Houston we have landed |pg||
nt|xenya: but he can!|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Not much of a hesitation there|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: The final bid optimum and correct|pg||
nt|lestergold: on the bidding and lead best to set up dims after trumps dawn|pg||
nt|lestergold: ten tricks easy on that route|pg||
nt|MolvaM: deklaran yeri görünce pik vale sorunum var diye düþünecek ama biz biliyoruz ki sorunu yok :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, need to duck the spade opening lead and made some good guessing later|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I dont understand one club opeing for Latvia|pg||
nt|athene: right; but not everyone plays this way |pg||
nt|mariner1: can he make this?|pg||
nt|mariner1: E needs to lead a @H|pg||
nt|athene: for example lauria-versace play (1NT) pass (2@H) X = t/o of spades, i believe|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H looks like a law violation to me|pg||
nt|athene: bidding 3 over 3 with only 8-card fits around|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: this should give England  about 11 imps|pg||
nt|mariner1: no should have the timing|pg||
nt|mariner1: now|pg||
nt|lestergold: north ducking wont help him|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont know why E doesnt bid it|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hmmmm bu da ilginç|pg||
nt|rodal f: But the quality for Romania have raised well the last years, as Bulgaria. Romania nr. 5 in Beijing open|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yes and I think we do a great job here at Brasov:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: or a Flaw violation :)|pg||
nt|pelu: and? - the Law is 50-60% so..|pg||
nt|athene: and south has a pretty defensive hand quite apart from only having five hearts|pg||
nt|athene: stiff diamond, slow black cards|pg||
nt|mariner1: the Suggestion of Total Tricks? :)|pg||
nt|athene: The Guideline of Total Tricks :)|pg||
nt|pelu: a free 2@H by pd - S dont know that N only have 3 small @Hs|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think it wld have sold as well with that title|pg||
nt|athene: well, this comes back to the point i was suggesting earlier|pg||
nt|athene: if south's double showed real hearts (i.e. 5+) then north's 2@H is quite likely to be only three|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: 6 clubs with double finn on hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could get ugly |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Indeed - no guarantee of a diamond trick|pg||
nt|ritong: roughly needs @s 2/2 or @h Kx, a rather good proposition|pg||
nt|ritong: welcome to lukasz brede|pg||
pc|cK|nt|poohbear: in comp with concentrated honors her hand is not a sub minimum|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: only 3H:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe checking to see if W has 6 @ss|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Henry |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Dummy walked away (wisely)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Hey Henri|pg||
nt|Gerben42: note that on a @C lead, @CAK, south will be squeezed in the red suits to make 11|pg||
nt|ronpa: Other table playing 5@C undbled|pg||
nt|ronpa: he doesnt know that West had only 7 diamonds for his opening, it will take a big effort to make this hand|pg||
nt|lokaty: hello everyone|pg||
pc|c3|nt|poohbear: but still a victory for Russia since 4@s is touch and go|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 15 sene kadar önce bu tür ataklar yapmayý seven bir parterim vardý.... hala var  :)|pg||
nt|eerbil: bu kadar agresif bir atak için bir sebep göremiyorum bu elde|pg||
nt|kastan88: EW using I aasume polish Club based system, tho 1@C is 11...14 bal or all hands 18+|pg||
nt|kastan88: 'assume|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: right|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: According to the EW cc, 2@S is indeed a 5+M4+m|pg||
pc|c4|nt|MolvaM: açýktan 3 imp verip ataðý geri almak mümkün olabilmeli bence|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C was forcing with clubs, since he is GF he chose to show clubs instead of hearts to establish the force|pg||
nt|tomi2: so they were in a forcing situation and double by Sikora is a suggestion to play there|pg||
nt|gracelin: I like that|pg||
nt|gracelin: looks like -2 here|pg||
nt|capercliff: both tables opened 1N, not my cup of tea|pg||
nt|capercliff: i'm assuming they are playing 12-?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this will work out fine and give 5 IMP back to the swedes, brb|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ritong: hiya buddy|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi luke :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Heya Lukasz :)|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|vugraphztr: signals?|pg||
nt|ritong: well, sikora thought about it in his grand|pg||
nt|xenya: the double is a bit on the greedy side i think|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, but it doesn't figure to be redoubled with those trumps|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphztr: switch to clubs...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 14-16|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H now?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: bad return the club|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence are throwing tricks at declarer likethey were growing on terees|pg||
nt|lestergold: trees|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are gona play for the Iasi tean in ure 1. div the comming season. So see u there Adrian|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: good 4 you|pg||
nt|gulyas: hi Lukasz|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ronpa: now to make he has to play low club and finnesse to ruff last diamond with the @C ace|pg||
pc|s4|nt|elbec: queen of diamonds was almost impossible|pg||
pc|s9|nt|xenya: yes, the @DQ would have been nice -- for the defence|pg||
nt|elbec: really strange switch|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I'd like to bet that W has no clue his partner started with @HAK9xxx|pg||
nt|yuval10: 6/8 @d will enable the contract to make|pg||
nt|ronpa: has to find a way to reduce his trumps in hand for coup|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: he must take hi's spades now|pg||
nt|hedyg: still has a @D loser|pg||
nt|ronpa: I think he has to play his @H before to ruff some in hand|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nope|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: take spades ruff diam with the ace and 7 of club|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is -1|pg||
nt|ronpa: yes thats the winning line|pg||
nt|ronpa: no thas made|pg||
nt|hedyg: will lose 1@H and 1@c that way|pg||
nt|poohbear: need to ruff both the spade and the Diam in dummy to make|pg||
nt|ronpa: why lose club? he will endplay him with @H for the last 2 tricks in club|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep|pg||
nt|poohbear: nope|pg||
nt|poohbear: trumps not short enuff|pg||
nt|hedyg: no way|pg||
nt|ronpa: oh true he still has @H to exit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will have a heart exit|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Barry, welcome|pg||
nt|ronpa: true|pg||
nt|poohbear: hi|pg||
nt|ronpa: should play J@H now|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer essentially needs to crossruff|pg||
nt|ronpa: other room played very well and went 1 down, didnt guess clubs were 4-0 (wasnt dbled)|pg||
nt|ronpa: so lets see if this will turn to be 2 imps to Israel or 11 to turkey|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the double here was a bit greedy|pg||
nt|ronpa: we will discuss that after the hand :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is considering all options|pg||
nt|hedyg: that takes a while|pg||
nt|capercliff: oh i've been corrected, EAST opened 1N in the open room|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: 8 cards in @c, only 7 in @s, so playing on @c|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Grosset is thinking........|pg||
nt|xenya: now it makes easily|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: hi Adrian|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: and they he is in dumming |pg||
nt|athene: it's often hard in defence|pg||
nt|athene: to work out whether to give partner ruffs|pg||

nt|henryb: they are too young to believe in bad breaks|pg||

nt|tomi2: but I know nordic bidding methods :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: wlc|pg||
nt|mikael_w: you have to do the trunph right here to make 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: unfortunately,  "style" points dont count on the imp scale |pg||
nt|sybarra: but Poland won big on the bd|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Manno just called the TD|pg||
nt|sybarra: for last bd?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: He was pointing at the lower left of the cc, the TD just took him away|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: They were whispering, couldn't hear|pg||
nt|athene: 4@C now from north perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: make sure of the right strain|pg||
mb|1N|nt|waso: they led A H  and heart|pg||
nt|syl: so the @D loser disappeared...|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 4 @D asks pard to bid major |pg||
nt|sybarra: but that is really a lot with S hand (imo)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Romania is coming back, but the 1100 will be devastating|pg||
nt|othered1: looking for side suit preference on trump ace lead?|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe that|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: 2 sp= Muideberg?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite flat boards so fare:( But Russia can gain a IMP. 11 in @H|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2000 = ouch|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: She's watching now|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@h  wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: transfer or? |pg||
nt|ritong: probably pass or double and 3@h by east|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@H probably a rubensohl version, showing 5+@Ss and inv+ values|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt not best idea |pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, here it looks ok to play 4 @s|pg||
nt|rayhaa: u have to bid it|pg||
nt|mikael_w: whith the @c layout|pg||
mb|2C|nt|andy_h: And again, bad breaks for whoever the declarer is |pg||
nt|tomi2: Toke Hoffmeister just turned 17 I was told|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: That's double pool right there o.O|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and after that 1 NT it might be tough|pg||
nt|capercliff: depends what defensive tricks they cash|pg||
nt|athene: even with a slightly weaker hand, it's right to overbid a bit to make sure at least you play the right suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: so a chance for Greece to pull it back to close|pg||
nt|sybarra: aha|pg||
nt|gulyas: if NS plays strong @C|pg||
nt|ritong: a good move, though|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: NE writing now|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @h sort of put sand in the works |pg||
nt|ritong: 3NT has low chances, needs to drop @c K|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: TD examining the notes|pg||
nt|santyclz: On the other hand, it's the type of auction that usually warrents a trump lead.|pg||
nt|capercliff: if E wins a @c with the Q might be easier|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I agree, If N is playing 4@s there is a natural trumpg lead from E|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: this contract depends basically on which hand the hearts are played from|pg||
nt|lestergold: the natural play of a heart up to the KQ loses of course|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D sets up GF with 5+@D|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: It most definitely is, pd is 6-10 (usually)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: This will also be set by a few|pg||
nt|gh1: good 3S not easy fore ØV now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard to come online no.|pg||
nt|henryb: 4@s and 3N both fairly cold|pg||
nt|othered1: A from AK even in trumps?|pg||
nt|elbec: 1@s shows 0-4 @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: well Ekrens 2@d is not new|pg||
nt|hedyg: amazing silence by W|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: !|pg||
nt|eerbil: 26 onör ile 1nt'de kalmalarý ilginç|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ingiliz takýmýnýn balans ayarý bozuk|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C was forcing, either Polish or Precision - we aren't quite sure - and 1@D some negative reply|pg||
nt|gh1: not so good 4s, but maybee not x|pg||
nt|rodal f: An X will cost at the 4|pg||
nt|Gerben42: even 3N making is 17 imps|pg||
nt|capercliff: if West can win a trick with the K@c before trumps are tackled, indeed he will get the finesse wrong|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: i mean who is going to play a heart tghe other way then losing the chance of finessing against the tenof hearts if th hearts break 4/1 the other way|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3 nt with lots of chances after the @c lead and the king wins|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@S is either a 4 dard suit, or a hand like this missing a @H stopper or strong (18+) with spades|pg||
nt|gracelin: they found their best contract.|pg||
nt|kastan88: NS play some 5-card Majors, better minors, (14)15-17 NT|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ..|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thinking...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and me sleeping:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: this is too fast 4 me:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am told by specs that 1@C is either 15+ with @Cs, or 15-17 BAL, or 24+ any hand|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D (2@C) X is always tricky because partner doesn't have to have both majors (as here)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: let's see|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no 5 diam or clubs ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: so they chose to play 4@S, this does not need hearts to break 4-3 but has some other dangers|pg||
nt|kaapo: This lead presents a trick|pg||
mb|4S|nt|babydolldk: On board 7 they bid 6@C|pg||
nt|raghavan: But if 2D is both Majors - the hand must be a real opening hand - or else difficult for respondaseer to judge - as in this c|pg||
nt|davidb: should misgueese all to go down|pg||
nt|elbec: now di franco showed 5+@h 15-17|pg||
nt|xenya: but S has 5!|pg||
nt|elbec: 2@s is asking|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4@H is cold on any lead|pg||
nt|kaapo: And also an entry to the North hand, unless East playes low, as he did|pg||
nt|yuval10: a slight overbidding by NS here...|pg||
nt|yuval10: N probably thought S has more for his X and 2@h|pg||
nt|yuval10: but the lucky position in the @c suit might enable it through|pg||
nt|ronpa: a @D lead might make declarer some troubles this lead will make it easy |pg||
nt|poohbear: easy?|pg||
nt|ronpa: (*er) ::)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure why N would play for the drop, 4 @S safer|pg||
nt|gulyas: there, they got to the top spot after all|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Screen opened and closed again|pg||
nt|ritong: ok, if 1@c can t be garbage, then 3@h is much more justified|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Manno was pointing at the part where it says what EW agreements are over strong artificial openings|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, now they have reatch the 4@s, rhis will be intresting|pg||
nt|elbec: 2nt denies 4 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: maybe best to win the @c and return a @c immediately|pg||
nt|tomi2: 17 IMPs for Germany if they make and 19 if not, so the whole play is like fighting for overticks|pg||
nt|Gerben42: just got confirmation Tomi, just turned 17|pg||
nt|capercliff: not the best lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: W will likely be presumed to have the @ck from no @c honor lead.|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3N possible  also|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: There the Norwegians where lucky. Decerved? My viue NO|pg||
nt|usla: a dbl cost Norway 5imp, now not dbl cost Russia 9|pg||
nt|capercliff: now its trivial|pg||
nt|elbec: yes i know... maybe he didn't like his spades... i can't understand|pg||
nt|elbec: or he's "tilted" :)|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@S is a good contract here -- doomed though|pg||
nt|mikael_w: No hesitation there eather :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 3 NT looks alot tuogher I think|pg||
pc|cK|nt|MolvaM: bu elde bizimkilerin 3ntye rahat gitmelerini bekliyoruz|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yuval10: nice leads by W , declarer might need to finesse @c right away|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: TD told Sikora to keep the notes for her, and told the players to resume play|pg||
nt|athene: i think 2@D was a definite alternative with that south hand (assuming 1@D shows diamonds)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: fly it!|pg||
nt|frusco: now can take ace|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|elbec: horrible 3nt here|pg||
nt|xenya: absolutely|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: manno also explained 1@S as 0-4 @ss|pg||
nt|elbec: no double no trouble :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: so it looks like he did it on purpose|pg||
nt|othered1: auction looks alm ost random and certainly doesn't show the methods off well at all.|pg||
nt|elbec: he had a spade in the clubs maybe :)|pg||
nt|elbec: would have you doubled 2@c asking with West hand?|pg||
nt|othered1: Almost looks like south was seeking a way out after misdescribing the hand initially.  As a rule, it works best to play that there's no way  to correct an error, with partner's ...|pg||
nt|othered1: cooperation.  Just make a decision yourself, if you can, and go on to the next hand.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: i predict a push|pg||
nt|gracelin: only 5-1 trump or 5-0 diamonds can cause troubles|pg||
nt|poohbear: off to a good start. |pg||
nt|ronpa: other table is in 2NT so a chance for big swing|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer carefully ducks a@h into the safe hand|pg||

nt|frusco: fear of west ruff|pg||
nt|frusco: after bid 2@h|pg||
nt|henryb: 3N would not occur to me with South. I would want to five partner a chance to show a sixth heart or three spades|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|Gerben42: doesnt look like making from here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @D are high but stuck in the unreachable south hand|pg||
nt|minnie lee: he needs to finesse to the @c9|pg||
nt|elbec: he was lucky that they can't make 4@s|pg||
nt|othered1: very|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: he was lucky no 9 or 10@H in S|pg||
nt|ronpa: he still has to guess at the end who has the K@D, can try to endplay south with the clubs and K@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: since N did not play back a @c he has none|pg||
nt|poohbear: so no declarer can cash majors and in the end exit a @s . He will make the hand as long as North has 1 @d honor|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: now the losing heart play|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
nt|yuval10: will have 2 entries for it with the K@d and the @s ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: good defence |pg||
nt|yuval10: he presumably knows that @s's are 4-3 from the bidding|pg||
nt|capercliff: I cant believe E underled the A@d here, Is this true?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yes|pg||
nt|athene: you might still be able to back into 4-4 heart fit if partner has a good hand|pg||
nt|athene: sorry, 4-4 spade fit|pg||
nt|pelu: spec to the danes: Nicki Sørensen won to days et6ape in Tour de France!!!|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can make 11 by playing flat-out, of course|pg||
nt|athene: @SK, @HA, @SA, heart finesse|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3N needs @cHx in W i think|pg||
pc|sK|nt|davidb: now 5 |pg||
nt|sybarra2: but 4 sp cold for e/w?|pg||
nt|yuval10: good def, but declarer can still make|pg||
nt|henryb: give partner|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s6|nt|MolvaM: zonda olmadýðý için sadece 6 puan ama olsun|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can endplay N in @s and let him play @d and make a guess|pg||
pc|h6|nt|charles_l: 2@d both majors is usually played weak|pg||
nt|tomi2: ...|pg||
nt|ort21: someone have live result|pg||
nt|ort21: ?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Never mind that Gerben :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: no guess|pg||
nt|ritong: @c hook was simply dangerous, wasn t it?|pg||
nt|sybarra: so claim |pg||
nt|frusco: but risk if A@d in Est|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe we are resulting,  but seems to me take club ace and draw trump is safer |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: The problem appears to be that the cc doesn't show what 2@H meant|pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult position - would look silly if the @CA got ruffed |pg||
nt|sybarra: hmm Mike .....that would be yuckky |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: NS are offered time now, to agree upon a defense against overcalls not listed on the cc|pg||
nt|ritong: heh|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: There was a claim btw, but I missed the   of tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: game |pg||
nt|sybarra: no OT's |pg||
nt|athene: the problem is, if east churlishly turns up with the @HQ, you go a lot down|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: well, they seem to have done ok by the seat of their pants on this one |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Silviu:) Welcome u are.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ritong: well, the problem is you have to bid 3@d in tthat case, and you cannot trust pard s bid, whatever it will be, since he is stuck with no @d stopper|pg||
pc|c6|nt|MolvaM: 6 imp yani|pg||

nt|yuval10: dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thinking...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|yuval10: doesn't have much to think here, he can't win with the K, and then ruffs the @s with the J|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I think is not easy:)|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|athene: this way, even if the finesse loses, at least you retain some control|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ronpa: has to guess who has the K@D|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ups|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|kaapo: Lauks takes @HA and exits in @Hs, waiting for the opponents to play @Ds or @Ss|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes but for him the virtual award is gone since he is so old|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|MolvaM: özellikle takým maçýnda zondayken zon kaçýrmamanýn önemini gösteren bir el bu bence|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He has the rest if he times it to perfection. West will be squeezed in spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|santyclz: I can't believe n didn't take the @h finesse first.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|poohbear: makes as long as North has one diam honor|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can choose to endplay either defender |pg||
nt|ronpa: south has to discard club now to defeat|pg||
nt|ronpa: to give declarer a losing option|pg||
nt|hedyg: he already discarded 1@d|pg||
nt|poohbear: no losing option|pg||
nt|ronpa: if he discards @C now decalerer knows he has Hx @D and clubs and can try to endplay him|pg||
nt|elbec: is nekrasova a woman?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
mc|10|nt|poohbear: only losing option is playing @d Q|pg||

nt|marlowepi: with KJx of spades i would not preemp to 4H. but with a stiff spade and KJx elsewhere, it is an attractive call|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|an|strong|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: As we all can see, any amount of clubs will make here....|pg||

nt|marlowepi: or hearts, or spades, as the cards lie|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: As Roland points out, I did not include the other 2 suits:)|pg||
nt|robinswr: 7 of any thing but diamonds will make even 7nt|pg||

nt|lestergold: simply unlucky thats all|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H looks right here|pg||
nt|gracelin: In a bidding challenge they will surely get the top mark by choosing 4S|pg||
nt|tomi2: in fact 3nt will make most of the times, because hearts can also split badly but block or ... if you bid 3nt fast they might lead something else, say the leader has Kx in hearts ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: and partner AQxxx|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, but after heart weakness exposed, I like Sikora's choice|pg||
nt|tomi2: sure|pg||
nt|tomi2: will we ever play board 10? that was an interesting one|pg||
nt|gracelin: a good result for Norway in the closed room|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ah... we'll just have to wait then|pg||
nt|kaapo: At the other table, the Latvian West led the singleton @D8 against 4@S on  7|pg||
nt|kaapo: His partner won with @DQ - but the 8 was difficult to read|pg||
nt|kaapo: So instead of taking the ace and giving a ruff, he shifted to hearts and the declarer has a chance|pg||

nt|kaapo: Our operator was needed elsewhere - thus the break|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hopefully we'll soon be able to get back to business|pg||
nt|kaapo: EW are likely to play some number of NT on this board|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps 2NT, if West opens a 14-16 1NT and East invites|pg||
nt|kaapo: And it might just about make 8 tricks|pg||
nt|kaapo: Someone with inside information makes a guess, that East would not invite|pg||
nt|kaapo: Rather bid 3NT straight away|pg||
nt|kaapo: That might be possible, with AKK and T9|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: hi|pg||

nt|andy_h: Good to know these kind of scores still exist lol|pg||
nt|tomi2: had a -2000 in Beijing playing the Individual there with a Dutch partner|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: It's got a 2, 4 numbers and 2 0's!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what's the time limit for the twenty boards, Bas?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 2 hours 50 minutes|pg||

nt|capercliff: yes|pg||

nt|poohbear: unless Ruso bravely balances here|pg||
nt|syl: the OLD 1444!|pg||
nt|andy_h: Maybe there's a pattern? :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|poohbear: I guess Osipov is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Curious as to who your p was, Thomas :P|pg||
nt|henryb: but if I bid 3@d and then 3N over 3@h it lets partner do a little more. 3N is always so terminal|pg||
nt|athene: someone seems to have been corrupting the danish youth with weak notrumps|pg||
nt|charles_l: yes ty 3N on 9 can be down on @h lead if misguess @dJ|pg||
nt|mikael_w: :) I just wakr up, so I needed a coffe :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ronpa: he has, it might be a bad one but it is :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 8 minutes a board|pg||
nt|capercliff: I cant see when the underlead would ever be right when S shows so many major suit cards|pg||
nt|othered1: could be some ambiguity with the @S spots here, but NS have lots of time|pg||
nt|xenya: hard to see where declarer can get 7th trick from|pg||
nt|pelu: weak NT are very popular in Denmark|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: just what Grosset did not want to hear|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sayýn yorumcular? yorumunuzu rica etsek?|pg||
nt|kastan88: 11...14 bal or 441@D4 or (16)17+ unbal, 18+ balanced seems they play|pg||

nt|Gerben42: this site is useful for finding a contract for a score|pg||
nt|Gerben42: http://www.rpbridge.net/cgi-bin/xrf1.pl|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Nice double by Delle Cave, showing extras without four spades|pg||
nt|ronpa: if south started with KJx @D's with the clubs the only making play is to endplay him in clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: with singleton Q@d in his hand he has a choice?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Catalin, Do you know what 1 NT is for E/W ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Charles then here S bidding game is not correct - Since points are equal & both majors with NS, S can pass |pg||
nt|davidb: duck is best |pg||
nt|poohbear: another competitive victory for the Russians|pg||
nt|gracelin: Guess East has shown his pattern and West will cjoose 5C|pg||
nt|gracelin: choose|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: W is again with his head on the table |pg||
nt|gracelin: he might try 3H first to solicite a singleton honor raise|pg||
nt|sybarra2: bd 9 3@H NS in closed|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: This is probably making (possible over)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: note that 2000 is also 5@Hxx+2|pg||
nt|tomi2: I won't tell, but maybe you can ask Tim Verbeek, he knows maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Haha, will do|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Usually with screens|pg||
nt|lokaty: 1@H = 3-4 @H 11-14 or 18-195+@H|pg||
nt|mikael_w: the opening 1 NT that is|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ronpa: after discarding 9@D he denied this option|pg||
nt|poohbear: only losing option was playing the @d Q|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 1.5 hours left|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: They're right on schedule|pg||
nt|gulyas: N has a typical t/o double here|pg||

mb|d|nt|charles_l: of course S should have picked 2@s|pg||

nt|henryb: 5@c would be a better contract|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: 10 trcks|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@H could easily be better than 5@C in case partner brings you @HQ instead of one of the club honors, but I like the 5@C bid|pg||
nt|andy_h: 1@S? These guys playing transfer responses in competition?|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@S = i have points but no 4 spades|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Dbl = I have 4 or 5 @S|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: TD just made the halftime call, we're half a board late|pg||
nt|tomi2: since 1@C did not show anything about minors they need 5 cards in both to bid a non forcing 2@C or 2@D|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok, ty|pg||
nt|othered1: so much for the @S spot ambiguity :)|pg||

nt|raghavan: East asked his partner to transfer to Spade. West should do so. He can bid 3Nt with a fit in Spades AXX.|pg||
nt|davidb: now Sp can declarer  problems|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ingiltere kaptaný maçtan sonra soyunma odasýnda baðýracak. rua 2liden rua omuzlamak yasak diye|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you need a natural raise of the fourth suit as a fit there can easily be lost|pg||
nt|xenya: well this gives declarer a tempo|pg||
nt|mariner1: I use 12 as my cut off VUL, also play transfers VUL|pg||
nt|pelu: I have to tell that I am a chiken - 12-14 non vul - and 15-17 in red :(:(|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: yes|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ty|pg||
pc|dT|nt|arigun: @d guess needed to make after @c lead|pg||
pc|d3|nt|davidb: should not throw D !|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT in OR was -3|pg||
nt|hedyg: lead was 4th best @s|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|gracelin: just 1 imp as I have predicted|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphztr: club?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no...|pg||
nt|ritong: manno has a good idea about hands now|pg||
nt|elbec: while they're on this boring contract, can i ask somebody from russia how do girls lastname suffixes work? do they just add an "A"?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ritong: the @c shift probably comes from 4 cards when dummy has 4 of them|pg||
nt|ritong: declarer tries to cater with @sHx anywhere, looks ok|pg||
pc|d5|nt|charles_l: now fairly clear @sA was single|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bbosunu yeni açanlar için belirtelim. türk milli tk kaptaný ise milli oyuncularýmýzdan yusuf sohtorik|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kendisi þu an romanyada hem U26 hem de Kýzlar takýmýmýzýn kaptanlýðýný yapýyor|pg||
nt|elbec: i was also curious about that :)|pg||
nt|elbec: just "a" or sometimes also "ova"?|pg||
nt|xenya: -a, normally |pg||
nt|elbec: meanwhile manno di franco wheren't able to switch to clubs and now ew have 7 tricks|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ritong: so west is very likely to hold 4@ds|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Gerben42: poor choice in @D cards|pg||
nt|tomi2: Poland is also blitzing Romania, boath have +42 or 43 now |pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphztr: Decl led from the wrong hand here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Leading @H9 from dummy|pg||
nt|Gerben42: accepted?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Yup, @D5 by N|pg||
nt|tomi2: same with France and Hungary, 4 teams leading the provisional ranking with 24 VP|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hopefully we will get some more exsiting board by the 10 left. To many flat hands|pg||
nt|othered1: There may be more discussion between N and S here.  Second @S play by declarer seemed to clarify defense|pg||
nt|xenya: well the duck was clearly wrong|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yuval10: so another 10 imps for Italy is on hand|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|davidb: will need a guess now|pg||
nt|ritong: diling|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|raghavan: another Spade|pg||
nt|sybarra2: this hand plays nicely |pg||
nt|xenya: as the defence has another suit to open|pg||
nt|othered1: Ping-pong result here.  Final ping by south|pg||
mc|10|nt|waso: first big swing for Hungary|pg||
nt|waso: 13 imps|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is not getting any easier |pg||
nt|elbec: They don't play "Smith" convention... as my friend bava says it helps a lot!|pg||
nt|elbec: now i'm afraid they'll fire their "lupara" :)|pg||
nt|othered1: simple attitude by north, clarified by east's second @S play, should have helped|pg||
nt|mariner1: I agree in IMPS its probably best not to use the lower range RED|pg||

nt|pelu: William - u are british - the weak NT came from GB (Acol)|pg||
nt|athene: yes, people sometimes just avoid the bad 12 counts, but then you are restricting how often you open 1nt which rather defeats the object|pg||
nt|athene: i think if you are going to play it you have to go for it|pg||
mb|2N|nt|waso: onlly with  the Ace of club lead|pg||
nt|rayhaa: 2nt tartan|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@S was too much is Open Room here|pg||

nt|poohbear: Cicek needs to have a balanced @c slam try available to bid past 3nt|pg||
nt|othered1: 12 tricks is a very n ice result.  |pg||
nt|elbec: almost automatic with a @s lead...|pg||
nt|athene: "i agreed to play it with nico gardener once, but obviously i never opened one"|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like 10 - 14 NV 2 way stayman, and 12-15 RED transfers on|pg||

mb|4S|nt|vugraphztr: nope|pg||

nt|ritong: or something doubled|pg||
nt|othered1: On @S lead, which likely would not be made against slam|pg||
nt|elbec: i guess 1nt is forcing :)|pg||
nt|athene: i agree, in england, all club players are fed on weak nt from birth|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: so 1D could be 4-4-4-1 |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: maybe|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: England managed to disgrace themselves in the open room|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@H actually could make, not that you can bid it|pg||

nt|rayhaa: 4@d strange|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: she wrote smth down for Lorenzini explaining her bid. i cant see what it says fro mhere|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: both N and S were passed hands, unlikely to balance on the 4 level|pg||
nt|hedyg: a wow lead by N|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C is conv, yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT as an opening bid can often be a slam-killer|pg||
nt|mariner1: RED vs NV might be best to play big as Peter said|pg||
pc|h2|nt|babydolldk: this should be down 1|pg||
nt|davidb: NS have a good save but EW  can make many hearts (6) |pg||
nt|davidb: 3NT was sp splinter|pg||
nt|lestergold: sogreece more ro less get it all back on this deal|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer has to guess which black finesse to take in 3nt but both work. Likely takes the one thru the overcaller|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kuzey bu kontru ceza niyetine attý ama güney bunu çözebilecek mi?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: maybe NS raise frequently on 3|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think in netherlands it is popular to raise 1@S on 3 cards|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, so youre less likely to find fit now|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that NS play weak multi and 2@S/@H a little better|pg||
nt|mikael_w: no, but still a double income foe sweden and some IMP:s back from rhe slam|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|raghavan: Ns have majority of points = South's 1NT +10 points with N normally should go down - |pg||
nt|mariner1: this might be a perfect Roland slam, 12.89 % that makes :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: (that % is a true guesstimate)|pg||
nt|waso: France avoided any trap  and bid 5d|pg||
nt|rodal f: Going for a sign of in 3@C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: defense was on thier toes |pg||
nt|mariner1: EW did well to not help S figure out N's suit|pg||

nt|ritong: banzai style has its ups and its downs|pg||
nt|ritong: that one belonged to the second category|pg||
nt|ritong: but hey, what a thrill:)|pg||
nt|athene: on a spade lead you can just hold up the @SA twice and then not let north in, although you are less happy, certainly|pg||
nt|athene: not a trivial declarer problem |pg||
nt|pelu: and decl dont have communication to finess @DQ into N|pg||
nt|athene: you have a double finesse you want to take in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but dummy entries aren't so plentiful|pg||
nt|athene: of course you don't know the diamonds are quite so obliging|pg||

nt|othered1: Has the "Keller" approach to partnership behavior at the table found its way to Italy yet?|pg||
nt|elbec: what is it?|pg||
nt|othered1: After Helen Keller, partnership is deaf, dumb and blind to each other's actions at the table.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|charles_l: even ruff 3rd @c to @h up doesn't work - trump promo for def|pg||
nt|raghavan: No useful discards from East hand. |pg||
nt|charles_l: @hK seems wrong - where is @c loser going if not 3-3?|pg||
nt|ritong: might have worked finding opener with say @h Jxx and no @s loser, but, as any very marginal shot, this unlikely, so costs on the long run|pg||
pc|dT|nt|santyclz: Do they play 2-way Stayman?|pg||
nt|elbec: we're too italian for that :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|capercliff: and a pretty skimpy invite opposite 11-13|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|gracelin: 7c is a good proposition if West has Kxx of clubs instead|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C is alerted because they respond 2@C also on balanced hands even with spade fit, so it could be on 2 cards only|pg||
nt|gracelin: so only 4C confirmed the club fit|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2nt is forcing and 3@C confirms some support|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@C confirms the fit, 4@H is a cuebid|pg||
nt|tomi2: and i got a hint from on of their teammembers, that 4@S is blackwood for clubs|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: Did I see 2@S first?|pg||

nt|tomi2: 4nt = 1 or 4 keycards in clubs|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|scotty: So therefore you are saying that the 4th seat preempt denies shortness|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome michael|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm not saying that, Michael ... I say it shows some light opening bid with a good suit.|pg||
nt|robinswr: no 4th seat preempts say that you think you have plays for game but not for slam|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|scotty: right , but since you think partner needs to know which values are important, it must mean that you deny singleton or void|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|robinswr: when in doubt, vulnerable, bid game and let them try to beat you. I tought that to meckwell which is why they are winning |pg||
nt|marlowepi: sounds logical|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|scotty: Exactly - so the whole club-diamond-spade value thing is irrelevant|pg||
nt|kareno: Not my idea of a 2nt bid - two card diversity ... you'll end up in a 4-2 fit too often.|pg||
nt|robinswr: just a guess and how is partner supposed to know|pg||
nt|scotty: I play 4th seat preempt shows a 7-trick hand - but not seven solid|pg||
nt|robinswr: makes sense|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: n could have bid 1n to show minors also... but said he wanted to apply max pressure|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in other words, i think, about what N had.|pg||
nt|scotty: Didn't know you were responsible for Meckwell success - hope you're getting the royalties|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|robinswr: 6-4 is not a 2nt bid|pg||

nt|mariner1: -  Running Scores (Refresh Often)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|syl: lets see some partials...|pg||
nt|gracelin: a wild hand|pg||
nt|kaapo: Great|pg||
nt|kaapo: I won't have to start explaining about different NT ranges then :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ok, so Sweden brought 13 IMPs for making 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: N/E taking a break, getting water :P|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: *:)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: taking small break here folks  not to worry |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: K, there we go|pg||
nt|gh1: Juniors no stop in 3club:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: Rusch could have opened @D's for partner for -2 I think, but thats "only" one non vul undertrick|pg||
nt|sybarra: may be disappointed with that score|pg||
nt|gulyas: mad scramble? I call it the 'greedy algorythm':)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Look at the Hungary kids go! 25-5 against France!|pg||
nt|ritong: i love that one:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: they are so closed...|pg||
nt|charles_l: 6@h is good here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphztr: yep wrong again from me|pg||
nt|usla: part scores time and see not happy juniors:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I anticipate a transfer:)|pg||
nt|ritong: ergl|pg||
nt|ritong: not that one:(|pg||
nt|gulyas: yay, go kids!:)|pg||
nt|lokaty: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: boo lol|pg||
nt|gulyas: top of the leaderboard, too|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: this is a very nice board, difficult decisions to make for all players involved|pg||
nt|kaapo: And another 6 for bidding 4@S on  8|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like a very good results for Sweden in the OR|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: lol Henri :) @H|pg||
nt|ritong: eheheh|pg||
nt|sybarra: well guys,  my lunch date is away from my pc.....need to leave |pg||
nt|gulyas: 25-4 in the meantime, sorry Henri:)|pg||
nt|ritong: strange|pg||
mb|3H|nt|poohbear: You specs arent paying attn . usually 20 people jump on me :P|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess the limits are 4S for NS and 5D for EW|pg||
nt|gracelin: but surely they will bid higher than that|pg||
nt|rodal f: U remember from own exsperiens? And ure still hard by ure biddings:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx all,   have fun!|pg||
nt|gulyas: bye Sherl|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bye Shirley|pg||
nt|ritong: i would open 1 NT with no soul state|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu all @H@H|pg||
nt|frusco: bye shi|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Take care Shirley!|pg||
nt|ritong: ciao bella|pg||
nt|frusco: :)|pg||
nt|henryb: 6@h is pretty good after the opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Marion is thinking|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, naturally|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: 3@s cue and RKC?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|davidb: 4spX is par in this board|pg||
nt|poohbear: North should bid 2@c only|pg||
nt|MolvaM: üçüncüden oyun açanda 13 kart bulunmasý yeterlidir konvansiyonu bu|pg||
nt|gracelin: as spec pointed out, even 4S maybe difficult for NS|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess south will not give up yet|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ah, 4@S 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@S can have longer @D|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@S is alerted because a) it can have longer @D and b) it can be on 3 cards sometimes|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT with 13 to 9 is never obvious|pg||
nt|ritong: the bid is problematic|pg||
nt|athene: on that auction south might have tried 3@S over 3@H but it's pretty rare you have a 4-4 spade fit after pd bids both red suits|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N does get it done quick here|pg||
nt|athene: you are supposed to have 4333 and soft values for 3nt and south sure has that|pg||
nt|athene: those cards are so soft you could use them to stuff pillows|pg||
nt|pelu: but what is Ns problem??|pg||
nt|mariner1: S has good count however N would have to have a lot of controls to make above 3N|pg||
nt|mariner1: safe|pg||
nt|athene: north is wondering how he can get to play it? dunno|pg||
nt|athene: i wld say north has a pretty good hand for 3nt|pg||
nt|pelu: are we waiting for East to bid? 4@D?|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@H are a good contract for EW - down 1-2|pg||
nt|mariner1: S bid to me shows what he has|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: "whoa" she thinks|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Bob bid with his 3 of hearts:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I think they are friends:)|pg||
nt|rayhaa: yes|pg||
mb|3N|nt|poohbear: in my opinion|pg||
nt|poohbear: Lets see how they handle this|pg||
nt|poohbear: are they playing a Polish style system Adrian?|pg||
nt|poohbear: that would make 3@c the correct bid|pg||
nt|poohbear: since opener is limited by failure to open 1C|pg||
nt|sybarra2: sporting X by W :(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East is not being backward in coming forward here|pg||
nt|ritong: ya sure|pg||
nt|ritong: he really wants to take the cues away|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: lol, Mike "the cryptical" Graham :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: with all those goodies, West may bid 4@S |pg||
nt|frusco: after 3@s ovest must to bid 4|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Maybe Sikora thought it was "go ahead with a 5-4"|pg||
nt|frusco: west sry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can West be 3-2 in the majors?|pg||
nt|ritong: certainly so|pg||
nt|capercliff: N needs to do something here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: not my cup of tea |pg||
nt|charles_l: the @hK is a big card|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphztr: sorry, the play had |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: gone on but i missed it. 3@h went down 1|pg||
nt|charles_l: np, ty|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ty|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Osipov said: 'nice fit' :)|pg||
nt|ritong: even 2/1 for that matter|pg||
nt|ritong: and the whoa is confirmed with a second cue|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh well into the fire as they say|pg||
nt|mariner1: to me N has a clear pass,,,,,,,, learning experience|pg||
nt|pelu: yes her bid was correct and N has some funny ideas - and will pay|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: probably W knows his partners agressive jumps -if not 4sp is ok nv|pg||
nt|davidb: A h & h looks safe vs 3-2 in trumps|pg||
mb|6H|nt|poohbear: and that would also make 3NT an easy bid by South|pg||
nt|ritong: this hand seems to be a matter of undertrick(s)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d a bit enthusiastic|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: holding 3 good spades and 2 bad hearts this system allows you to bid 1@S and partner rightside NT contract - but he can also find out later about your 3 cards if he has a strong ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am told NS play 2@c as balanced 18-19|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@s is cold obviously|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think both N and S shod do somerhing more here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Have to go nowm folks and leave u to this exciting encounter between these promising young bloods|pg||
nt|mariner1: ty Mike|pg||
nt|ritong: three down looks normal|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bessis bid a quiet 2@d in the OR and played there|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ingiltere takýmý 1@c açýp bir sürü þlem buluruz diye hazýrlanmýþ ama rahat býrakmýyor rakipler|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6@c sizce nasýl kontrat?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ah, I see we lost 2 board :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT was mini|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 2@D looks like a 2-way Stayman|pg||
nt|kaapo: Which is a gameforcing relay|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2NT denies 4c majors, and probably also denies 5-card minors|pg||
nt|kaapo: 3@S shows 5|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 3NT shows 2 @S|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C forced 2@D to show a sign off in @D or some stronger hands|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C forces 2@D, but maybe there is a case for bidding 2@H here, since so many @D fit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: A great result for Sweden |pg||
nt|yuval10: reasonable bidding, yes still a big swing in favour of Sweden|pg||
nt|yuval10: *yet|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and a nice recovery after 0-48 after 6 boards|pg||
nt|charles_l: rehi. i see i missed some excitement|pg||
nt|elbec: indeed NS are fighting|pg||
nt|mariner1: well now there are 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: Grosset needs to unblock|pg||
nt|kaapo: This shows a draw back in 2-way Stayman|pg||
nt|kaapo: Since West hasn't got 4@H nor 5 cards in a minor...|pg||
nt|kaapo: And he has 2@S...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Wow, I wish I could pen X at the 1-level lol|pg||
nt|Gerben42: anyway, gotta go|pg||
nt|Gerben42: thanks all|pg||
nt|andy_h: See you later Gerben|pg||
nt|tomi2: ok, thx Gerben!|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Bye Gerben, take care|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: routinely|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: is he really thinking?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep|pg||
nt|ritong: can t hurt|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: again|pg||
nt|hedyg: i bet Lorenzini is hurting|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nope|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: 3@H has some entry problems: you need 2 entries to dummy to take  finesses in @D|pg||
nt|charles_l: 4@h must deny @c@d cues|pg||
pc|c6|nt|charles_l: find the @cQ for 3N|pg||
nt|raghavan: breather given by defense|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3NT shouldnt be too difficult . Declarer prob just unblocks spades and ducks a @c|pg||
nt|poohbear: and falls back on the @d finesse if @cs dont break|pg||
nt|henryb: I would only have bid 2@h; but I am old|pg||
nt|ritong: with north hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|henryb: no, with S|pg||
nt|ritong: was an option, yes|pg||
nt|henryb: and the auction might continue 6@h by north|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: that s the way ahan ahan i like it|pg||
nt|pelu: ok "only" down 1 - but 600 looks better :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, and 3@s show intrest|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: and thx Rob cu all  soon|pg||
nt|ritong: why would he?:)|pg||
nt|kaapo: We (and the defence) know his full shape: 2-3-4-4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Worst he cold get by an 2/1 I belive|pg||
nt|mikael_w: S Dbl only showed @d I guess|pg||
pc|c8|nt|charles_l: a friendly lead|pg||

pc|c3|nt|poohbear: ok declarer sees things differently than me :)|pg||
nt|lokaty: I disagree with 4 @S. 3@S doesnt promise anything more then 2@D, his @C values arent impressive and they are not vulnerable.|pg||
nt|gulyas: the lead giving away a trick, but still not enough for declarer probably|pg||
nt|ritong: DID NOT EXPECT MORE|pg||
pc|c9|nt|davidb: he is still ok|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|capercliff: wonder if they have a specific agreement of what X of a transfer is, suspect not|pg||
pc|c2|nt|poohbear: If the @d finesse had lost declarer might have had a spot of trouble|pg||
nt|yuval10: 11 tricks now are likely|pg||
nt|yuval10: so 10 imps for Sweden|pg||
nt|ritong: meanwhile the poles tried an intricated auction on the board michielsen bid a bold 3NT, and they lost 10|pg||
nt|henryb: I do not know what their auction means, but it was effective if lengthy|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kaapo: This appears to be going down now|pg||
nt|frusco: HI ALL|pg||
nt|ritong: always a pleasure to bid and make a slam after opponents opened the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: hi|pg||
nt|ritong: hi|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphztr: thinking|pg||
nt|hedyg: because when he stops to think he either had a stiff K@C or is thinking to switch|pg||
pc|s3|pg||

nt|henryb: Hello|pg||
pc|c7|nt|raghavan: not good defense|pg||
nt|charles_l: looks like S dbl says 'don't lead'|pg||
nt|yuval10: it will be the same even if declarer make 10|pg||
nt|ritong: find the capslock, please:)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ritong: well, this is not really hurting|pg||
nt|ritong: how so, 3@s does not promise more than 2@d?|pg||
nt|ritong: are we deprived of green cards?|pg||
nt|gulyas: now he only needs both @H honors onside, but that will not happen|pg||
nt|lokaty: its just obvious bid from the MP1s:)|pg||
mc|12|nt|gracelin: well done HQ, to hold it to -2|pg||
nt|sybarra2: after the XX  think it is for pen. |pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|robinswr: when there is a singleton in dummy, the normal signal is suit preferance |pg||
mb|d!|nt|kareno: Middle encourages, no, Steve?  High and low suit pref.|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: yes|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: That is how most play it.|pg||
nt|scotty: I think most experts would lead a heart from the S hand - combining thought of major and not giving away trick or tempo|pg||
nt|kareno: Needs less from partner to help also.|pg||
nt|scotty: Against 1N-3n, you might find some spade leaders|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and most would bid with the S hand if nonvul i think|pg||
nt|robinswr: or some diamond leaders|pg||
nt|robinswr: good lead problem for 1nt 3nt|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|scotty: But if partner has nothing in the suit you lead, a spade might well turn out better, if E has both honors or W has Hx.  But I would lead a heart|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: Two more boards now & then, for the last 2 sessions, the Lynch lineup will change.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|robinswr: good partner has the at least the jack|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: i agree that a heart looks normal, but it might be instructive to run a simulation. one of the downsides of the heart lead is that you have so much stuff pd will have one big card ...|pg||

nt|sybarra2: can n/s make 3 nt on that last bd?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: those specs looking think yes |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Oh, decl didn't realize N had a trump left|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and they are playing 3 nt in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: They've settled for -2 now|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I think we're almost back on schedule now - Ernst and Vincent, especially Vincent are infamously slow in play with the other Dutch schools|pg||
nt|poohbear: KOs are a much better test |pg||
nt|athene: of course that needed the defence to be sleeping|pg||
nt|athene: but north's actual line required them to be dead|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: EW might get to 4@S fast if east makes a weak jump overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|babydolldk: 4@S made on 10 = 12 imps|pg||
nt|davidb: good slam for EW   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: being a fully-paid-up chicken, i think 3@S is an overbid as well |pg||
nt|capercliff: here he could have choose 2@h as TO of course|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@h?|pg||
nt|ritong: i like 2NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW likelu need to stay low|pg||

nt|mikael_w: E/W :s week 1 NT has made alot of problems for N/S so far|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 2 @s is exaktly what n/s make here I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: South might have a hard rebid if there is no systemic agreement|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Croatia need Davor Suker, Zvonimir Boban & Robert Prosinecki:)|pg||
nt|kastan88: sr, Sir Operator, I'll stop commanding :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can become a funny 3NT EW|pg||

nt|mikael_w: But now I wonder why S dosent open 1 NT ?|pg||
nt|henryb: friendly table|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H or 5@D NS here|pg||
nt|mariner1: N should invite in now or just bid 4@H|pg||
nt|mikael_w: while E/W has a chanse in 3 @h|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: over 20 boards the better team should win. Not so over shorter matches |pg||
nt|mdgraham: but not guaranteed either|pg||

nt|rayhaa: disc a @d for 9 now|pg||
nt|charles_l: the @s8 is useful|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gracelin: NS may go down in a major suit slam with wrong (but reasonable)  guesses in both major suits|pg||
nt|kaapo: NS are close to making 4@S|pg||
nt|kaapo: But it should lose at least a spade, a diamond and 2 @Hs|pg||
nt|kastan88: 1@C= 11-14 bal or 441@D4 or 17+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|sybarra2: in comparison e/w will say:  we took the early save" |pg||
nt|rodal f: But will might end at a partscore in @D|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I'm not sure I like 3@D, got the HCP and distr, but the suit is lousy|pg||
nt|yuval10: can W fins the excellent @s lead? not likely, i'd say|pg||
nt|yuval10: *finds|pg||
nt|frusco: 5@d is unlucky|pg||
nt|ritong: good try|pg||
pc|h8|nt|poohbear: I guess the Russians are playing a Polish type system otherwise North really shouldnt pass 1H|pg||
nt|syl: good chance to declare 2@H in both rooms...|pg||
nt|syl: but here S reopened|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: lol|pg||
nt|elbec: double double :)|pg||
nt|othered1: LOoks like south will play 4@S, unless north insists on @C|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|tomi2: my experience is that Dutch schools player are all very fast, so if you play average tempo you are "slow" :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Haha, I guess we do|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H conceals the hand but doesn't help if they bid 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: you might try 3@S or 4@C or something |pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@C makes?|pg||
nt|mariner1: several routes to go, some make 4, some 5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mariner1: we have a back and forth match going here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N a very reasonable spot|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C = Precision style, 2@S = hearts, 2NT natural i guess|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in Open Room are in a tough 3N here|pg||
nt|athene: i would think this is the sort of game you stumble into more often than not|pg||
nt|athene: east opens and west just decides to force to game|pg||
nt|athene: with the good heart suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes and it would be tough to bring 9 in I think|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: no |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: they play natural|pg||
nt|poohbear: works out very nicely for them here|pg||
nt|hedyg: is Lorenzini/Grosset a new partnership? i seem to rember Lorenzini used to play with another partner|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu 2 kör cevabu kör ataðýný önlemek bakýmýndan iyi|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C was likely strong (or Polish), and 1@D negative|pg||
nt|kaapo: South has some @S support and a hand that is pretty maximum for 1@D|pg||
nt|kaapo: So he might find another call|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Any time I play with my father, and I mess up, he says "Look at the clock, we've got another 8/30 minutes left! Take longer!"|pg||
nt|ritong: offshape preempts with unexpected strength often turn out good|pg||
nt|gulyas: now he needs to find the @S ruff to defeat this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: need to find the spade ruff now, and how can they realistically do that?|pg||
nt|frusco: nice stop|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and Bob It's suerly a very good player|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ozgull: apaçi ye 5 li renk geldi:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 3nt or pass?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: pass...|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3NT in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: However, being rebellious and a schools player, I shrug it off :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ama deklaran 2 as çýkartmak zorunda|pg||
nt|MolvaM: iþi zor|pg||
nt|begse: kör oynanmazsa 3nt oluyor aslardan biri alýndýgýnda|pg||
nt|MolvaM: her 2 asýn da güneyde olmasý iyi|pg||
nt|syl: in OR S removed N 2@H to 3 @C|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|charles_l: 4@c 4@s seems ok|pg||
nt|othered1: to me, south's auction implies another place to play.  Might north now try 4N to bring @D into the picture?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well. after 300 at ORit seems like some IMP:s back to franse|pg||
pc|dA|nt|poohbear: this lead will not strike fear in declarer|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: i am told she is playing on the girls team|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: classic lead|pg||
nt|gh1: i think 3dia is the limit here 4 are down with good def|pg||
nt|usla: hard defence at 3 nt from E, belive they makeit|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3NT and min 1 in the other room|pg||
nt|lokaty: which is hard to believe after 3@H jump:(|pg||
nt|ritong: @d shift difficult|pg||
pc|d3|nt|MolvaM: güney zor bir karar vermek durumunda kalacak|pg||
nt|charles_l: 5@c a lucky make|pg||
nt|elbec: now he makes 4@s|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|babydolldk: unlucky lead..|pg||
nt|kaapo: It appears, that West would have to lead hearts twice to keep this to 8 tricks|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, he wasn't on lead, so he can't|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: well read by north and now west was trapped into the opening lead|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gh1: but i think he make 5 now:)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|MolvaM: eðer apel gelmezse|pg||
nt|tokay1975: h donusu mucize  masada|pg||
nt|capercliff: both of these pairs are playing a lot of transfer|pg||
nt|mikael_w: not sure to make 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|elbec: not a nice lead by west|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S now makable as cards lie|pg||
nt|elbec: but he needs to guess how to play|pg||
nt|charles_l: not easy still|pg||
nt|othered1: right.  "as cards lie" equivalent to |pg||
nt|othered1: "double dummy"|pg||
nt|charles_l: W may try @sAx|pg||
nt|elbec: come on andrea! he needs that to calm down!|pg||
nt|othered1: That will end the defense|pg||
nt|elbec: not an easy play from west now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|begse: defans as alýnca kör oynamak zorunda|pg||
nt|MolvaM: @c5'li apel mi?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: apel ise ne apeli?|pg||
nt|ozgull: iki tur kör alýnmayýnca karo dönülecek|pg||
nt|eerbil: smith echo gibi|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, too difficult|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|MolvaM: neden bu kararlar hep bana gelir diye düþünüyor|pg||
nt|begse: yok  udca tek sayýdýr|pg||
nt|poohbear: but I think it is the correct lead|pg||
nt|athene: miguessing now could be bad|pg||
nt|athene: spade to @SA, @HK|pg||
nt|mariner1: Norway is into 2nd place as we sit|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: eurobridge does noit have a pic of mr Grosset|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rodal f: Better with A and a new @D|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I was surprised again :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or might not. Belive I'm wrong. Not shure|pg||
nt|mikael_w: even if they made 10 in OR|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|MolvaM: zonda 3nt swingi|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|rodal f: Anyway. 10 or 11 tricks bought give 6IMP for Russia|pg||
nt|athene: but declarer was probably intending to overtake in diamonds and finesse clubs|pg||
pc|sA|nt|charles_l: lead saves an undertrick but stll -100 likely|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 10 .mp|pg||
nt|tokay1975: ama yinede bu 3nt komik  cok agresif bidding 3nt diyen elde abartcak bisey yok defansin kartlari daha normal olsa  hemen 2 3 iceri gidicek|pg||
nt|MolvaM: imp|pg||
nt|kastan88: after partner's converting double to penalty, yes, to take off possible ruffs into dummy |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 2he  dahada dusuyor elin degeri|pg||
nt|MolvaM: acaba güney hemen baþta zayýf 2 kör filan mý açsaydý?|pg||
nt|pelu: the C-fines will save him|pg||
pc|c7|nt|MolvaM: kuzey pardon|pg||
nt|rodal f: 9 give 5IMP|pg||
pc|c6|nt|poohbear: Good technique by declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep|pg||
nt|ritong: i am not completely aware about that  i just know that lorenzini lives in the east of france, where i have many friends, and they told me he is very promising|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is indeed, even if he misguessed the @ds here|pg||
nt|tomi2: E could have ducked the @CA but decl was favorite to get the clubs right anyway because of the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: France and Norway going strong at the top of the table. However, this is just round 12 of 22, so many things can happen|pg||
nt|yuval10: 8@c call for a @s return|pg||
pc|c9|nt|eerbil: Güney ilk trefli almasa defans biraz daha kolay olabilirdi|pg||
nt|sybarra2: never to see dummy again |pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|davidb: good bidding by EW . play should not be a problem|pg||
nt|poohbear: no reason to overruff when there is a loser to pitch|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes if you play both suit "with the odds" then you lose, but I think N did not bid his 5 cards in the OR, so E lead a heart and I guess W shoed his count|pg||
nt|elbec: now he can't miss it|pg||
mc|8|nt|poohbear: EW needed totake the @d ace before plying the @c|pg||
nt|syl: crossruffing may be superior|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=12&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|yuval10: and S does very well to return @d, but declarer can simply finesse @c or @s now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Israel coming strongly from behind after a very poor start|pg||
pg||

mb|1N!|mb|2C!|an|majors|nt|kareno: Penultimate hand now.|pg||
nt|robinswr: thats the rule of 15-17|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|kareno: Thanks to Diane Graese for an excellent job Operating for us.|pg||
nt|robinswr: when declarer shows up with KQ of spades ak of dia KJ of hearts, not much left|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks to my fellow expert commentators for their wit and wisdom.|pg||
nt|scotty: It would be nice for East if double of 1N is TO here, though at this vul, may not risk it|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks to the USBF (especially Jan Martel) for allowing us to report their premier events|pg||
nt|robinswr: i play it as responsive|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks to BBO for a fabulous platform for showing these great events every week of the year|pg||
nt|kareno: And thanks to the specs for keeping us awake!!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, it should be as a passed hand facing a mere one-level overcall, i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: i would lead a heart also|pg||
nt|marlowepi: better to have a doubleton spade though|pg||
nt|robinswr: but looking at all the hands, i would lead a club|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: is that on your card?|pg||
nt|scotty: Unlucky lead - a club would have defeated 1N, perhaps by as many as 4 tricks.  But no reason for E to find that|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|kareno: Yet when partner sticks his vulnerable neck out to overcall, one should consider leading his suit, even a singleton.|pg||

nt|poohbear: this will likely be another Russian pickup|pg||
nt|ritong: this is interesting about the overcall|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer is under no pressure in 4H.  But if he were in slam, the normal way is to go wrong in both major suits|pg||
nt|tomi2: with qxx in spades lindqwist is not likely to lead singleton Q in 6@S|pg||
nt|kaapo: Meanwhile, Latvia has scored some IMPs on boards 9 and 10|pg||
nt|kaapo: So, is the East hand still a weak/mini 1NT, or 1@D?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: E has left the table|pg||
nt|kaapo: So he can't decide|pg||
nt|kaapo: And is going to find a coin|pg||
nt|kaapo: To help resolve the dilemma|pg||
nt|kaapo: I have this info about the (possible) 1@D opening: marmic, 13-16bal, eller nat (kan vara canape med klöver)|pg||
nt|kaapo: I suppose it's simple enough to understand, even to those who cannot read Swedish|pg||
nt|kaapo: "klöver" = clubs|pg||
nt|kaapo: With help of the @H finesse, EW have 11 tricks at NT|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: With only 13 rounds to play, it's hard to recover from a <10 score|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: transmission problems |pg||
nt|capercliff: playing the A was 0%|pg||
nt|othered1: slam is quite good, preferably in NT|pg||
nt|athene: but if the lead really was a singleton, the club finesse still wouldn't bring them in|pg||
nt|mariner1: Germany and Israel are down in their matchs so Norway doing well moved up|pg||
nt|mikael_w: to bad Sandra diddent take rhe chanse after the lead to discard a @d, was worth 1 imp|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4 of either major works here|pg||
nt|poohbear: I wish I could say Croatian pickup as all the Croatians are good friends of mine|pg||
nt|ritong: uh?|pg||
nt|ritong: zia like?|pg||
nt|ritong: ah no|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Looks like it, judging by the IMPs|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 33 IMP lead is 22-8?|pg||
nt|hedyg: michaels?|pg||
nt|charles_l:  13 not recorded|pg||
mb|1D|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: srry|pg||
nt|ritong: np|pg||
nt|hedyg: so now @H+@D|pg||
nt|rodal f: So fare: France 219, Norway 216|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@d from N....on the way to 4@h i believe|pg||
mb|p|nt|babydolldk: nice 6@H without at trump lead...|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 10 3NT 1 down here. Open room 4S = 12 IMP |pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S does play a trick better likely|pg||
nt|ritong: hm|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice to play unsual vs unusual and be able to bid a nf 3@s here|pg||
nt|ritong: wild shot id say|pg||
nt|hedyg: junior bid?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@d seems to be on|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: who's thinking?:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: even 6?|pg||
nt|hedyg: always Grosset :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: now is hard|pg||
nt|poohbear: that would be my choice|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c pass or correct|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW probably need to stay low here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|davidb: every card is ok for NS  for 11 tricks in H . |pg||
nt|poohbear: and Ozturk's as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: with the lucky @cs he should be able to make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: how about N bidding 5@C instead of 5@d, showing force in @c and fit in 1 of the reds?|pg||
nt|kaapo: In a diamond contract a major suit ruff would bring it to 12|pg||
nt|tomi2: in all junior competitions you have a bi difference between the best players and the "newcommers" Jassem and Tuczynski playing for Polish schools won that event already 2 years ago ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: and are playing in first Polish league. They are very experienced and good players while there are lots of teams with players who only play Bridge for one or two years and don't ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: have as much training as others have, so we will see lots of 25-x scores this week|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The Swedes did well to choose NT in the other room. 4@H is in jeopardy|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 4@h will manage, def. doesn't have communication|pg||
mb|2N|nt|poohbear: dbl now|pg||
nt|poohbear: get the @hs in|pg||
nt|kaapo: But the 4-1 break is akward|pg||
nt|kaapo: At least if South leads the singleton @C|pg||
nt|rodal f: A practic bid:)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: But we have seen other players then W that has missed to play K/Q whith doubleton there, But still I think its a better chanse ro just play the 10 right|pg||
nt|capercliff: if East had Hx then small would suffice|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: E may sac in 4@s over 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I like this kind of bidding:)|pg||
nt|gh1: i think 4s-1 with right def, and spade switch fore -1|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: You're right there, Thomas :)|pg||
nt|ritong: 2NT 3@h 4@h|pg||
nt|ritong: boo|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Now S shod be warned whith this hand to bid any more|pg||
mb|3C|nt|poohbear: Especially if EW can bid 2NT scramble |pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@d is a game try|pg||
nt|poohbear: South should reject|pg||
nt|ritong: declarer needs five @c tricks, he will find them whatever his choice so big hit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Montanari sees no defensive tricks vs 6@D.....|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he might bid 6@s|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nope|pg||
nt|eerbil: bu kadar öndeyken alýþveriþ ihtimali düþük eller gelmesi hoþ biþey|pg||
nt|capercliff: if KQ doubelton still has a chance later|pg||
nt|othered1: 32 HCP and good @S fit should be easily bid to slam here|pg||
nt|charles_l: E can shape out with 3@h|pg||
nt|charles_l: OR in 3N NS. lets see how the ladies handle it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: N sure has a lot to be passing 3@D|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, particularly when he holds @sAK, his pard very likely has an 8 bagger|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=733&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1 for running scores in the Schools series|pg||
nt|tomi2: this looks like an interesting spot they have reached now|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: West will pass |pg||
nt|davidb: if N is short in Sp , S hand is not so good . ok to pass Nv'  |pg||
nt|hedyg: would have been -4|pg||
nt|hedyg: Grosset "the thinker" might take a while to play this|pg||
nt|ritong: he has no real alternative|pg||
nt|rodal f: Need @S returne for set the contract NOW|pg||
nt|henryb: suitable dummy|pg||
nt|mariner1: W thinks E has to be entirely broke, not quite though|pg||
nt|athene: he could have doubled 1@H i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i am told they play Ghestem, so 2@s was @H+@C|pg||
nt|poohbear: trump switch best|pg||
nt|hedyg: time to play @c|pg||
nt|capercliff: and E would have to play a @s for ruff and discard anyway|pg||
nt|charles_l: 4N?|pg||
nt|charles_l: wow|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 3 NT is for sure a kontract I dont want to be in,|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|charles_l: if Z rebid 4@s it might go ppp...?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ms. Hoderova is playing the bartender now|pg||
nt|raghavan: N should try spade ruffs before drawing trumps |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: has left the table in order to procure drinks|pg||
nt|tomi2: west chose to pass 2@H - it's quite popular in Poland a) to upgrade lots of 14's to 1NT and b) to superaccept on maximum and 3 cards support - so he chose to pass 2@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2H is probably making.  Nice stop by Sikora |pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer will promote the 4th @s to discard a @c, and ruff @d in dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, West could have led a diamond against 3NT I suppose, but he chose his own suit, clubs. Not such a good idea|pg||
nt|ronpa: well played|pg||
nt|pelu: pass or 2@S?|pg||
nt|athene: now you might pass with east, on the basis that even if it makes, it's only 180 :) no disaster|pg||
nt|mariner1:  E needs to pass if he can find it|pg||
nt|athene: borderline pass of 2minor doubled is much more common than 2major|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3@c warns misfit to S, so good stop|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I dont know is they play 1 NT as forcing here ( but I doubt it ) and then I think pass on 1 nt is a good bid|pg||
pc|sA|nt|santyclz: We'll save everyone's reputation and claim w shifted to a @d after winning the @ck...|pg||
nt|xenya: it does look a bit odd|pg||
nt|othered1: Worked out OK, even in 6N better|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphztm: S thinking.......|pg||
nt|syl: bold bid this 3nt|pg||
nt|gracelin: unless declarer misguessed D after north ruffs club and return a low D.|pg||
nt|kaapo: North has only 3 hearts, so after (taking @H finesse and) ruffing a @H, EW can draw trumps and then raise the @S trick|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Bech explains to Lauks that his part's hand is a REALLY bad 13|pg||
nt|sybarra2: take no finesses.... |pg||
nt|tomi2: since W made no negative double E should have good spades for his offer to play 4@S. W with Hxx and @H shortnes can pass maybe|pg||
nt|mikael_w: As the layout is here this shod make|pg||
nt|rayhaa: loose 3@c 1@s|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@h is a counter Game try|pg||
nt|poohbear: perhaps North should accept that|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@D was an artificial GF|pg||
nt|kaapo: And I suppose 3NT means what Florin told|pg||
nt|kaapo: This should go 1 down|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mariner1: @H lead helps declarer|pg||
nt|hedyg: that helps!|pg||
nt|sybarra2: bang down aces and kings  |pg||
nt|xenya: but was brief and to the point|pg||
nt|othered1: brb|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mariner1: probably always makes 5 though|pg||
nt|athene: south has bid north's hand for him here|pg||

nt|tomi2: I think 4@S is better than 5@D, esp. on this @D layout|pg||
nt|tomi2: Hoffmeister has already bid 4@D, if he wanted to run out of 4@S maybe he should have offered 5@C to let partner decide the final contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps his p could've halped him by doubling 2@d|pg||

pc|s3|nt|vugraphztm: bd.13 was fault|pg||
nt|gracelin: did C9 call for spade ?|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes but nopbody leads from Q into jx when xxx in spades is also available|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kaapo: I held a elementary bridge class a while back, and I kind of remember the book stating something about 33 HCPs for a slam|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kaapo: So perhaps Bech could've settled for 3NT|pg||

nt|sybarra2: easy from here of course|pg||
nt|yuval10: which he didn't, according to the movie|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|ronpa: now another club|pg||
nt|poohbear: On a @c switch declarer wins and plays a @d. East can win but he has a dillema . If he cashes the spade that sets up a trick. If he doesnt  then it gets pitched|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, I guess he had to cash it|pg||
nt|poohbear: and declarer can set up a long heart|pg||
nt|hedyg: it was a question of cash or cash it|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I know 1 NT might be up to 11 somerimes, But marmic whith single @c is the worth posible distribution when your P bid 1 NT affter 1 @d|pg||
nt|mikael_w: sometimes|pg||
pc|s9|nt|poohbear: another trump now and declarer will attempt to cash 2@ds but the second gets ruffed. He can then ruff a @h and get the good Q of @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: played by S in OR on J@S lead|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and they played fast untill now|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: south raised to 4@S, saying "don't lie, i know you have lots really!"|pg||
nt|athene: and south was indeed correct|pg||
nt|ritong: then " undo" "undo" "undo", "sorry" "sorry" "sorry" etc|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and apparently easy at the table:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: no point in popping A@H here|pg||
nt|charles_l: yes agree, usually 1@d - 1N(=4+@c)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphztr: everyone's having a laugh|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gracelin: yes, there is no discard available for declarer, so north will just sit back with DQ|pg||
nt|poohbear: had East NOT cashed the spade and played a trump . Declarer would win in hand and cash a @d pitching a @s then play Ace of @h ruff a @h |pg||
pc|h8|nt|kaapo: Or pehaps he could bid somthing to suggest a minor suit contract, say 4NT or 5NT?|pg||
nt|tomi2: Rusch could also have 5 clubs and 4 spades for his bidding|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: the cups are tiny|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hedyg: when a @c comes from W he can claim|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 1@C Polish @c|pg||
nt|poohbear: it was indeed 7 to Russia on the 1@h hand. NS played 3@c in the other room. That was 2 high|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, some players play cards very fast - some don't place their card clearly enough on the table (or the screen hides it)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 2@H seems to be the (in)famous Muiderberg, as we call it, 5@H, 4+m|pg||
nt|charles_l: ty|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ritong: amusing|pg||
nt|henryb: X = one suit or 4Major, longer minor?|pg||
nt|ritong: east almost has the best hand at the table after this start|pg||
nt|ritong: i would translate that with a pass|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ...|pg||
nt|henryb: and you would be wrong as declarer takes 6 tricks while you have a cold 4@h|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks Catalin|pg||
mb|1S|nt|davidb: 1Nt opening 14-16 won the prevoious board|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D perhaps an underbid in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: five trumps and an ace...maybe worth 4@D|pg||
nt|athene: wld be nicer with two spades and the stiff in hearts, admittedly|pg||
nt|athene: (or that's what north probably thought) :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers asking for 6@D here|pg||
nt|kaapo: The South hand here seems to me at least as good as the one North opened 1@C on  13|pg||
nt|kaapo: Even though it has 1 HCP less.|pg||
nt|kaapo: Now, in a limited opening system...|pg||
nt|kaapo: South might have a was to show a maximum opening with 6@H and 3@S|pg||
nt|kaapo: Like 2NT|pg||
nt|kaapo: *way (instead of was)|pg||
nt|kaapo: This might be yet another case for 3NT with a good 6-card major|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: which probably he cant remember now as he is staring at the (very high) ceiling|pg||
nt|sybarra2: muiderberg or funky tartan?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 2NT asking which m|pg||
nt|ronpa: open room here bid quickly to 3NT defenced blocked clubs so only 2 off|pg||
nt|ronpa: *defence|pg||
nt|ritong: not a sure shot, but could turn out in a bloodbath|pg||
nt|henryb: South may run.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ritong: anyway, grosset is " cricri" on BBO and i can say that he is a super nice guy|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|ronpa: will padon bid 4@C?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: or he will lead the ace of clubs?|pg||
nt|ronpa: he's not on lead so... :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he won't lead anything|pg||
nt|ritong: probably systemic|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hedyg: 3NT is on NS any lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: and now is the time to bid it|pg||
nt|gracelin: Now a lucky grand slam bid by Norway in open room|pg||
nt|othered1: we can see if it gets in the way of a constructive auction|pg||
nt|sybarra2: E pleased to hear it is @C |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 50 minutes left|pg||
nt|lokaty: 2@C natural GF, 2@D relay for majors|pg||
nt|ritong: @hs into the picture soon, then|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@H showing @S here|pg||
nt|pelu: play for 6@C - but diff to find @HJ|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H is a nice reverse to me|pg||
mb|3C|nt|charles_l: i think 4@h is a practical bid - not dbl|pg||
nt|poohbear: Ruso should lie by dbling if she feels obligated to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i would have opened a 20-21 2NT with the 2 10s and 9@d|pg||
nt|usla: matchpoints dbl in OR, saka style:)|pg||
nt|ronpa: he knows opp are bidding on long @D's|pg||
nt|santyclz: So our 2nd push of the match.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: looks like a standard 3 NT here, whith maybe 1 IMP to sweden|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sorunsuz|pg||
nt|tomi2: just getting some bets that polish players wont bid the grand, but my experience against sikora and nawrocki is that they will :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes this is a good time to grab a coffee|pg||
nt|mikael_w: my guess here is that 1 NT = @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2N shows the bid hand with little @c help as he has|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: !!|pg||
nt|poohbear: She rebid 3@h?|pg||
nt|poohbear: would think she would be thrilled to raise NT|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and now Mr. Osipov.... pass:)|pg||
nt|ritong: the fact that he takes his time playing this important event is rather a good thing, i add|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure it is|pg||
nt|ozgull: düz bir el daha|pg||
nt|tokay1975: bu elide cozduler pastan gelen ortaga  dbl muthis|pg||
nt|tokay1975: kesinlikle pas derdim ben alakam olmazdi|pg||
nt|kaapo: So 3@H now could either show exactly 3@S - or deny 3@S. South just doesn't know which :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit passive by E? 2@C as bid for anyone?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: shaka style= 5 clubs:)|pg||
nt|ritong: easy going|pg||
nt|elbec: they can play 3@c in NS|pg||
nt|pelu: 3½ loser - |pg||
nt|charles_l: whats wrong with 2@c by S instead of 1N?|pg||
nt|charles_l: oh.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|charles_l: unless 4m=m+@h|pg||
nt|babydolldk: if you play leaping michaels maybe 4@C...|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt showed the strong version of 1@C? what wld south do with the weak NT? pass 2@C?|pg||
nt|gracelin: Sikora may still regret on  11 when they stopped in 6C but trump K was onside for seven.|pg||
nt|andy_h: Not much to this hand, with the diamonds breaking.|pg||
nt|andy_h: And of course N is going to lead his shortest major to hit partner's suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|babydolldk: :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: good decision by N 4SX goes 2 down VUL -500 where as now only 450|pg||
nt|charles_l: between dbl & 4@h, guys?|pg||
nt|babydolldk: D|pg||
nt|mariner1: Q10 @D comes down so this will not take long|pg||
nt|kastan88: disaster in Open Roome here, after quite similar bidding as here, IMO North can't bid 3NT with only 1 stopper, double much solid decision,|pg||
nt|lokaty: from this hand 13 tricks propably.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok Cliff, I do that then|pg||
nt|elbec: somebody for a double after 1@h with N hand?|pg||
nt|athene: east has one of the best doubleton queens you can have|pg||
nt|athene: and two side aces are always nice|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: Sikora is a gabmler and Nawrocki not so when West has the final decision to make...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: good lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep:)|pg||
nt|elbec: di franco is having a senior approach today :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 7D makes on 2-2 diamonds or singleton Q, altgether about 52.5% chance|pg||
nt|kaapo: Although, of course they may not have that kind of agreement at alk|pg||
nt|ritong: no comment|pg||
nt|mikael_w: THIS is a great kontracr now :) if Sandra just get the @h right|pg||
nt|mikael_w: sry Sjöberg|pg||
pc|s4|nt|poohbear: This will not do well|pg||
nt|tomi2: 7@D always makes when Sikor is playing and Qxx(x) is not offside ;)|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am sure he won't go wrong here.  That's a safety bet.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: 4 @h = cue at this point |pg||
nt|sybarra2: (just a guess) |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Johansen just explained it as such|pg||
nt|othered1: Now has to find the @CQ.  Never got their good @S fit in, however.|pg||
nt|xenya: not me, but i would jave probably balanced as N|pg||
nt|xenya: *have|pg||
nt|charles_l: 3N makes on other days - just not today @cs4-1|pg||
nt|mikael_w: But when the bad break in @c distroys it|pg||
pc|sA|nt|MolvaM: demek sen de yaþlýsýn tokay|pg||
nt|othered1: There goes the @C guess|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ok now found? |pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@C actually has a play, though its not easy in 4 suit|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tokay1975: ole gozukuyo:))|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: e n-am fost atent|pg||
nt|gracelin: Nawrocki adopted the scientfic approach by asking trump Q|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes he would have to as 2@C was not forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: now claim 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: now you can shorten matters cricri|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: only 7 looser|pg||
nt|ritong: east is the probable declarer, dude  you can wait til the board is over to say " heyy i ve got some @s values"|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tokay1975: 100  sayi yazar giderdik biz|pg||
nt|gracelin: thedenial|pg||
nt|andy_h: W will duck a heart, in the (off?) chance that S has preempted with 7 of them and diamonds don't break - then he can take finesses into the non-danger hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: in @H suit|pg||
nt|pelu: but even if u find @HJ u have problem with @H6|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5 is safe........|pg||
nt|athene: well, when you lead to KQ10, it's normal for a defender over you to duck with Ax(x)|pg||
nt|athene: to induce the misguess next time|pg||
nt|athene: so|pg||
nt|athene: there's a case for saying|pg||
nt|mariner1: you can play 2 high @H and then hook for the 9@H...... not that easy to set up|pg||
nt|athene: if you lead to the king and the ace is played|pg||
nt|pelu: u can - if u are very unlucky - lose 3 @H-tricks|pg||
nt|mariner1: and not intuitive at all|pg||
nt|athene: you should play the defender for AJ rtight|pg||
nt|athene: *tight|pg||
nt|athene: because with Ax(x) he wld have ducked|pg||
nt|athene: but it's certainly a very tenuous argument|pg||
nt|athene: anyway there is more to it here because you are worried about the fourth round of hearts as well as the third round|pg||
nt|athene: east has said his all here|pg||
nt|athene: with doubleton heart and @CQxx, then he might have a 6@C bid|pg||
nt|pelu: but id u play @Hs from top then u have a finess for @H9!|pg||
nt|pelu: best lead is a @C - |pg||
pc|c5|nt|MolvaM: son 5 borda giriyoruz|pg||
nt|kastan88: Now South had to decide to leave 3@S doubled or look for minor contract (that he mentioned with good-bad 2NT)...|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I think is not a classical good / bad NT|pg||
nt|lokaty: :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kastan88: yes, but similar their|pg||

nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg: i must say i am very impressed in general with the quality played by all these juniors|pg||
nt|hedyg: junior bridge nowadays is good!|pg||
nt|tomi2: hmm lost my bet :(|pg||
nt|tomi2: but sikora will find the @DQ anyway so i was kind of right|pg||
nt|gracelin: Sikora can't be sure that partner has four trumps, otherwise he knows the only problem was trump Q and he would find it.|pg||
nt|kaapo: Spade loser goes on a @D so this is as good as 3NT as it is|pg||
nt|sybarra2: who leads from qxx?  or x of @C on this auction |pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphztr: they are thinking and I'm sleeping (a little bit) :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gulyas: maybe he wants a sacrifice, the vuln is just right for that:)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|gulyas: after he told himself what to lead, he doesn't|pg||
nt|ritong: pity|pg||
nt|gulyas: so its a push|pg||
pc|c8|nt|charles_l: if i D then 4@h i expect W to move with @sA and @hQ10x|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kastan88: good play from West here, he must put declarer under pressure at once, another way dias will be thrown on good hearts|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit more aktivity at the other room so X came natural|pg||
nt|ronpa: same block here and now declarer has to decide -1 or -4|pg||
nt|elbec: ducking|pg||
pc|cK|nt|usla: after 3 @C pre W hand count what tricks?|pg||
nt|rodal f: U can ask:) Was a hard one|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: so % clubs better over 1spade?:):)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: '5 clubs'|pg||
nt|ronpa: *-2 or -4|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3 NT would have depended on North's choice of leads|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: when his partner doesn't raise spades, and opps go for 3nt, west knows there's no future in spades|pg||
nt|athene: hence the heart lead|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: The @C10 surely showed the @C9, so East could have overtaken  |pg||
pc|d3|nt|ronpa: I think that after J@C West would do much better by playing 8@C|pg||

pc|s6|pc|h4|nt|athene: spade lead "to see dummy" might give away a crucial tempo in some layouts, allowing declarer to get his @SJ10xx or so set up|pg||

nt|santyclz: Perhaps 2 imps, w managed to end up controlling both minors.|pg||

nt|raghavan: should be in 4H or 3NT|pg||
nt|davidb: E can find a way to 10 tricks if not playing all spades |pg||
nt|kaapo: The Latvians made 3NT on  13 so the gap got smaller there|pg||
nt|kaapo: And they found 6@D|pg||
nt|kaapo: So now we're where we began: 0-0|pg||
nt|kaapo: EW might end up at 3@C here|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 5 more boards|pg||
nt|santyclz: E, I mean.|pg||
nt|mariner1: Denmark in 3N on 15 Closed Room|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room|pg||
nt|mariner1: we are Closed Room :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Maybe it was to tough to play another @c there, now she is 3 down, but remember that S do not know she has 4 @h tricks|pg||
nt|rayhaa: with @ds and @s wideopen shd cash out for a push|pg||
nt|charles_l: a close match|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: are you undersaying that it used not to be ?:)|pg||
nt|othered1: trump leads at 5-level, like at small slam, better be right, since you seldom have lots of time to change your plans|pg||
nt|andy_h: Netherlands trying to pile up the small plusses|pg||
nt|andy_h: They need whatever they can get|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Too late for that now :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well 3N did make in Open Room, its not a lay down|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D shows a major suit here|pg||
nt|hedyg: i believe it better nowadays than it used be say 20 or 30 years ago|pg||
nt|ritong: mm..|pg||
nt|hedyg: remembering your junior days Henri?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: at this table they play a very good and NATURAL bridge|pg||
nt|ritong: somewhat|pg||
nt|yuval10: N passed here, might be significent if EW will bid to 4@s|pg||
nt|poohbear: Yes. That says unblock please. 10 says dont unblock|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here 4 @h seems ro depend on right guess in @s|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: it's all very well to double these artificial bids to show "cards"|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: but the critical thing is what your subsequent actions mean|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2nt?|pg||
nt|kaapo: If East had opened 1@S, that is|pg||
nt|charles_l: i hate arguments at the table|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: i.e. what does double mean?|pg||
nt|yuval10: the 1@s in the OR helped the Italians to bid to the easy 3NT|pg||
nt|ronpa: when north fails to cover 8@C I think East will get the message|pg||
nt|gulyas: this looks like a slam you want to be in if the @H finesse is on, and you want to stay out of it if it fails|pg||
nt|gulyas: since its on, you want to bid it:)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: not a bad score for france to make 2 @s in OR|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: is a new suit forcing or non-forcing?|pg||
nt|athene: if you haven't discussed these things, you are often worse-off after the first double|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: pass?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: but internet is a gigantic booster, nowadays|pg||
nt|hedyg: XX showing Hx in @s?|pg||
nt|tokay1975: gencler uyanik akarken dolduralim diyorlar|pg||
nt|gracelin: poland might score another game swing here.  Tough for NS t reach 4H after the 1NT response|pg||
nt|gracelin: North plans to bid H then spade to show his 3-suiter|pg||
nt|tomi2: I like Zatorskis 1@H bid, he is the player who bids 3 card suits and underleads aces more often than me :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: and let south decide the final contract|pg||
nt|kaapo: I'm not a fan of 1NT openings on 5M-4m hands|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: !!!|pg||
nt|capercliff: nice 4@h here but not a claimer|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S must be @c's|pg||
nt|athene: EW have all the ingredients for 6@D here, except for @DA@HA :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: whenever i dbl with W my pd rebids 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: south can raise to 3H when already denied a 4-card major|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: !!!|pg||
nt|lokaty: 2@S:)?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might as well bid 7, then|pg||
nt|santyclz: N needed to cash the @hs first with a @s entry to s to make the 2nd overtrick.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztr: very good players here|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would take 2@S here as showing values|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2S might show a minimum|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I wonder what 1@S is|pg||
nt|yuval10: already starts very interesting, 1@s perhaps one long suit|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think it is suction perhaps: @c or @h and @d|pg||
nt|henryb: a good small slam. a bad but making grand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|davidb: S  is very guite today  NV 2H is ok|pg||
nt|davidb: 5 D is makable still (club 3-3 ) |pg||
nt|hedyg: yes it certainly is. Juniors are much more exposed to international bridge|pg||
nt|ritong: being able to watch almost all of the best play on the planet everyday or so is unvaluable for these youngsters|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu el pek rahat deðil bence. depo doldurma operayonu açýsýndan|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: pass at 1 sp rdbl?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Many Swedes play what they call "Häxan", which is a close relative to Gazilli|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 1@S-1NT-2@C would not be natural|pg||
nt|kastan88: 2NT!= transfer to diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yep:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: and N decided to leave it which must indicate that he has many @s's|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, I have to go, have a good one, and check out Hungary leading the Schools event:)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this looks lika 5 IMP to france and rhen we have 27-27|pg||
pc|h5|nt|raghavan: good lead for declarer|pg||
nt|gracelin: it's alerted.|pg||
nt|othered1: Things are extremely friendly for a @H game here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can become a funny board|pg||

nt|lokaty: bye|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bye Daniel|pg||
nt|gulyas: bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Bye Daniel, see you later|pg||
nt|ritong: start was automatic, the tough part is coming nox|pg||
nt|ritong: now*|pg||
nt|ritong: @dAQ look bright, i d try 4NT|pg||
nt|henryb: I have adopted a new method: 1@d-1@h-2@s is either a strong jump shift or a good heart raise to free up 1@d-1@h-3@h for hands like|pg||
nt|ritong: "no batteries included" as our friend john stewart uses to say|pg||
nt|mariner1: those are some fairly important ingredients :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ozgull: sistemlerinde 5 li h dengesiz davet|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2pik tek mi gösterdi?|pg||
nt|tokay1975: sanmam  2sp davet edicem birazdan gibi biseydi|pg||
nt|MolvaM: dengesiz olduðunu gördüm de daveti geremedim daha.  bakýyorum|pg||
nt|eerbil: bence 2nt kýsalýk sordu, 3@h de pik kýsa demek|pg||
nt|ozgull: 8 puan olunca zaten zon diyorlar:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not necessarily at these colours. North could pass with anything NV vs Vul|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this could get 500|pg||
nt|ronpa: good dbl by south, this will be painfull|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: -1?|pg||
nt|charles_l: its never productive and gives oppo confidence|pg||
nt|athene: east's 2@S-then-3@H shows both minors and short hearts i assume|pg||
nt|mariner1: makes lots of NT|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|hedyg: best lead|pg||
nt|gracelin: then 3D sign-off, unless north has extra.|pg||
nt|gracelin: looking at thse NS hands, I am not sure I want to be in 4H|pg||
nt|tomi2: but then you should not think that long|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: amazing:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: The other room are in 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: no overcall in OR by N|pg||
pc|hK|nt|raghavan: gets a OT|pg||
nt|kaapo: Parhaps that fact made East think it's better to open 1NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@C, @H, 2@d|pg||
nt|athene: you are a little bit worried on a heart lead|pg||
nt|athene: could be nasty if the @HA is wrong|pg||
nt|pelu: need both Aces wrong|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gracelin: I don't really know their system, all speculating.|pg||
nt|tomi2: this time partner has a prime hand, but every time he bids a game with a worse one and it makes, opps call TD and claim that thinking long for bidding 2@S suggest more then really ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: minimum|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mariner1: J@C coming down is key here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hayýrlýsý|pg||
nt|tokay1975: koz cýkýsna  3h olmaz|pg||
nt|MolvaM: delikanlý adam koz çýkmaz|pg||
nt|eerbil: gördüðümüz kadarý ile @d rua normal atak :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: evet @DK þablon|pg||
nt|Walddk4: as long as they are undoubled|pg||
nt|henryb: @sAxx, @hAQxx @d Kxxxx @c x|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|poohbear: nice spot for NS|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 3nt  iyi aslýnda  bati dusunebilir 3nt demeyi|pg||
nt|eerbil: herhalde benim tahminim gibi deðil anlaþmalarý, çünkü öyle olsa erdem 3nt derdi|pg||
nt|begse: 3nt düþünmeli mutlaka|pg||
nt|tokay1975: herhangi bi davete o el 3nt dusunebilir|pg||
nt|tokay1975: cokda onemli diil ne daveti 6li h davette olsa|pg||
nt|gracelin: Indeed, and screen doesn't help here. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not a double to be proud of|pg||
nt|ronpa: -2 from top but if north tries a sneaky low @H it will turn to -1|pg||
nt|poohbear: No guess for the @c as West  known to have 2 aces and is a past hand|pg||
nt|xenya: this is a killer|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk4: why give the show away?|pg||
nt|henryb: somehow one ought to be able to come closer to slam on these cards|pg||
pc|hT|nt|charles_l: luckily only OTs at stake|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|gracelin: the normal CQ lead will beat this|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 off|pg||
nt|elbec: manno is a very serious player but sometimes is a little bit nervous... i'm sure he feels the pressure...|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|begse: ne olsa 3nt demek ya kendi lövem var ya kör tutuyorum demek|pg||

nt|rodal f: Best spot from Simonsen I belive, but need to find the 10th|pg||
nt|yuval10: not at all...but appearently was hopping that P can deliver at least 1 trick|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North will know south has trump tricks - bet he just cashes @HA|pg||
nt|mikael_w: down to 4 IMP now :)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|tomi2: i think a cross ruff and later exit might help|pg||
nt|othered1: we can see 11 tricks, but declarer is looking for the safest 10|pg||
nt|ronpa: we will soon find out|pg||
nt|poohbear: Ozturk should have played his most discouraging @H|pg||
nt|ronpa: well he can see AKQ@S in dummy like us but lets see if he resists the temptation of low @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: should have denied a @h trick here|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry Barry, i am too slow :(|pg||
nt|ronpa: anything but low @H will lead to -2 even a spade|pg||
nt|poohbear: :)|pg||
nt|ronpa: I think he should try another club promoting partner's mid @D cards having A@H as entry|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pg||
nt|tokay1975: evet|pg||
nt|tokay1975: cevapci hala 4h der isterse|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer might still make this with a cross ruff line and some intereesting ending|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Emma can and probably should make it after she has been told that spades break 5-0|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphztr: Bob claim: "tutti frutti" :)|pg||
nt|henryb: maybe even bid 4@d over 3?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hedyg: he can do that now|pg||
nt|charles_l: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/RunningScores/Asp/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=732&qshowflag=1|pg||
pc|sK|nt|poohbear: now declare will play @ds|pg||

nt|tokay1975: ama ille  zon oynicaksak bari iyisini oynayalým|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|poohbear: ruff a @s cross to a @c  claim|pg||
nt|hedyg: highest @H for @d|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|begse: ama zaten 7 puanlýk el pas diyecek bi el|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: not enough minerals :)|pg||
nt|lokaty: I ve heard the explanation from the Italian kibitz, that 2 sp was either 6+@H 11-15 or 5@H4@S.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|MolvaM: bu her elde zona gitme sistemi seyir açýsýndan fena olmuyor|pg||
nt|kaapo: "häxa" is a witch, by the way :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|hedyg: would @c back have promoted the J@s?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: þimdi 2 kör oynuyor olsalardý herkes uyuklayacaktý|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c9|nt|raghavan: well played young man|pg||
nt|kastan88: still 2 tricks away for declarer and push|pg||
pc|s8|nt|tokay1975: abi ben bu elle davet etsem sizi bana 3 ay bric oynamama  cezasi gelirdi:=))))|pg||
nt|begse: kolay gelsin genclerimize  tebrikler |pg||
nt|elbec: at the moment there are 4 teams from second to fifth place in only 3VPs!|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't really see why E had to open on his meagre collection oppisite a passed partner, vulnerable |pg||
nt|elbec: NS encourage with the odd and play reverse count (high low odd)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: oh my god shes going so fast|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: her collection, sorry|pg||
pc|c6|nt|yuval10: that's weird...|pg||
nt|poohbear: Really unlucky for East.  When he first looked at his hand after his partner opened one spade he would have been thrilled to know he was getting dbled in 3@ds|pg||
nt|ronpa: sure|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Now Cilla will make rhe right guess for sure|pg||
nt|charles_l: hm|pg||

nt|tomi2: well played!|pg||
nt|gracelin: Nice play.  Bye all|pg||
nt|othered1: As shown, wasn't that only 10 tricks (@D, @C and @H off?)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Next board are 4@S at W|pg||
nt|rodal f: In the other room|pg||
nt|andy_h: Double partscore swing - reducing the deficit|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: On the previous deal, note the nice @SJ discard by N, and then leading a @S to hand. Tough for W now to take the A with KQ in dummy|pg||
nt|yuval10: so the technical problems appearently caused some mess|pg||

nt|liviu123: bord 13  |pg||
nt|yuval10: yes, it's the problem , but the result here is correct|pg||
nt|liviu123: board 13 is another score|pg||
nt|yuval10: however, OR made it wrong, as 3@d was actu ally down 1|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1NT making was the correct score, so we might want to ask the operator of the Open Room for the right result in board 13|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 17 already played|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 77-35 is the score after 17|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: how?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: credit to the 2@C overcall, then|pg||
nt|charles_l: take a WC break or something|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in 3N looking for 9th trick I think|pg||
nt|pelu: 1Nt - 3Nt - but only 8 tricks - from start|pg||

nt|athene: yes, 4major+1 is the most common boring flat board by a long way|pg||
nt|MolvaM: açýk odada birisi kontr demeyi unutmuþ. çok iyi skor|pg||

nt|kaapo: I'm glad I didn't buy a lottery ticket today ;)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@D is around 11-15 if unbalanced or 13-16 balanced|pg||
nt|kaapo: So East is quite maximal and might find a move|pg||
nt|kaapo: I suppose Bethers isn't thinking, but Arvidsson|pg||
nt|othered1: Game in either pointed suit is possible NS, but may not be easy to handle|pg||
nt|ronpa: the Israeli NS at the other table did very well to let 5@C play and not bid 5@D|pg||
nt|charles_l: 2@d 3@d seems normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: just needs K@C in pocket (and reasonable @S and other breaks) for slam|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@s is comfortable 5 is not|pg||
nt|poohbear: but it will make|pg||
nt|tokay1975: ben katýlýyorum 4h x bole bi el ifade edemez  ehveni ser cok begendim b|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hmm arda kötü þeyler düþünüyor|pg||
nt|eerbil: çok yüksek baþladý konuþma, tehlikeli bizim için|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kontru düþün arda baþka þeyleri boþver|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nop, N was|pg||
nt|po-s: perhaps Bech should have thought|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: clearly you shdnt buy that ticket|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D seems to be w2 in one major, and south hopes for more than those jacks in partners hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: which means that this will be flat|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
nt|mariner1: not likely to be slam hunting on 10 opposite 16|pg||
nt|athene: south might get interested now|pg||
nt|syl: w may dble this|pg||
nt|hedyg: S might get involved now|pg||
nt|ronpa: sure he's going to bid 4@S :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: game on a finesse . Missed in the other room. no big deal NV|pg||
pc|s5|nt|davidb: W dreaming of KQ spade & A cl for a slam|pg||
nt|athene: but it's a bit pushy facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5@c is exclusion RKCB asking for aces but NOT the @c ace|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c non gf|pg||
nt|tomi2: I prefere 20 boards - we are playing championships, so why play 48 boards a day only...|pg||
nt|kastan88: 1@C = 11...14 bal or 441@D4 or 17+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or as Terje Lie say. 10 always. Will get a @H ruff might|pg||
nt|mariner1: now looking for 10th trick :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: def have 2A and 5@c|pg||
pc|sK|nt|raghavan: E has passed |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: (after consulting CC)|pg||
nt|gracelin: Ok, will stay on. Can't miss this slam hand.|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hejssan PO|pg||
nt|po-s: hej|pg||
nt|kaapo: You'd have passed as West?|pg||
nt|gh1: ggod lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's a bold prediction, Roland :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: only 3|pg||
nt|ritong: so 3NT, @c Q lead|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphztr: yep but ...|pg||
nt|poohbear: so a misunderstanding and finally I get to say a possible pickup for my friends from Croatia :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Maybe Davor is here:):)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: & Zvonimir:)|pg||
nt|tokay1975: obur taraftan onunda tedbir etmesi lazim 6h yapamicaklari acik rakibin deklarasyonundan  esit zon durumunda|pg||
nt|tokay1975: x diyebilir teklif gibi  dayanabiliyosan birak dayanamiyosan 6h de |pg||
nt|hedyg: why 4@H?|pg||
nt|henryb: I am afraid I too must leave you, Henri.|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a vous, henry|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|hedyg: showing an acol style 2@d opening with the 3@d bid|pg||
nt|ritong: this shouyld not survive|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, not on a @s lead..|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 2Diam GF & 2Cl semiforcing|pg||
nt|ritong: unless west tries to have a glance at dummy|pg||
nt|tokay1975: ama pas  demeside kabul edebilir|pg||
nt|rayhaa: and 4imps for France|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: it will be on a finesse at best if partner has the perfect @HA @CAJ|pg||
nt|mariner1: and E might have an important card too, and does here with K@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: well S should win A@C and pull @S and lead a @c|pg||
nt|athene: @CA, draw trumps|pg||
nt|poohbear: Who are they?|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D confirms the strong variant of polish club and asks partner for further information|pg||
nt|tomi2: 3@C confirmed 5 hearts and some extras, 3@H sets trumps and starts slam investigation|pg||
nt|po-s: absolutely - East has max 15|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like it's going to be easier than I thought|pg||
nt|tomi2: nice lead here found by hoffmeister although a small club would be nice too ;)|pg||
nt|ronpa: this will have hard time making|pg||
nt|hedyg: E bid 3@c twice, how many does he need?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possibly a bidding misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|ritong: i tend to like the U26 thing|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: France back up to 6 VP now|pg||
nt|frusco: lol|pg||
pc|d8|nt|davidb: E showing min - W gave up. flat|pg||
nt|davidb: " new york syndrom "|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose he might play low on the basis that even @CK, club ruff, diamond isn't beating|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Davor Suker & Zvonimir Boban:):)|pg||
nt|poohbear: OK....................|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6 kör demediði için artýk ne dese mutlu oluruz :)|pg||
nt|tokay1975: splinterle  basladi  bidding  goremez  hemen 3love hde almiyolarsa|pg||
nt|tokay1975: normal|pg||
nt|ozgull: no double no trouble|pg||
nt|gracelin: The Polish Club in operation|pg||
pc|d2|nt|poohbear: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes ty Adrian|pg||
nt|gracelin: 5 is probably exclusion RKC|pg||
nt|tomi2: 5@D asks for keycards outside the @D suit, but unfortunatly east has a hand where he could even pass this|pg||
nt|tomi2: I am asked why undos are accepted in this match, I can explain you:|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: when you see an undo it means in 99% of the cases, that the operator made a misclick|pg||
nt|tomi2: and not one of the players|pg||
nt|kastan88: 1@H= 7...11 , 3+@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: does 2@d show fit in @c 100%?|pg||
nt|ronpa: Padon couldnt start with 2@H directly over 2@C which is nf|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ???|pg||
nt|ronpa: no 2@D is just forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: and probably declarer will stagger home via @h J hook after discovering the horrible @d break|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|othered1: cue-bid at south's second turn, unless a transfer to @D, wouldn't be everyone's choice.|pg||
nt|andy_h: South was obviously hoping for @HKQ-6th with North...but didn't 3@C say weak with hearts, Bas?|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N happens to make as cards lie |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|tomi2: one poor guy is sitting close to the table and tries to record the cardplay for all of us here in BBO|pg||
nt|tomi2: most often players play either very slow or very fast, so in the "fast" case it is hard to follow all cards and bids|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: mr Sikora is now counting on his fingers :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: Nawrocki was surely imagining counting on his fingers|pg||
nt|gracelin: 5NT shows two but I onkt see 1 key card outside D in East's hand.|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: must've gone wrong somewhere. restarted the count|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes something is wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: probably the false 5nt is giving him headache|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would expect 2 keycards and no @HQ from east using my fingers to count|pg||
nt|Walddk4: A bit annoying to watch a board that has been played already|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he felt obliged to show his @hs now?|pg||
nt|hedyg: this reminds me of bd 7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|poohbear: yes girl Make them pay|pg||
nt|MolvaM: we can do turkish commentary in one room in ALL of the matches of turkey. no problem. just let me know|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sorulara cevap ....|pg||
nt|eerbil: peki erdem'in önce 4@h'e kontr atýp rakip 4@s deyince 5@h demesi hakkýndaki fikirleriniz? daha defans içeren bi el göstermez mi sizce?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: .|pg||

nt|MolvaM: yarýnki maçlar 19.00,   14.00  ve 17.30 da|pg||
nt|sybarra2: nice place to land |pg||
nt|othered1: very well done|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I'd just bid 4@D, I think|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I've shown P a very good hand bidding that way|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphztr: and Aliosja Asanovici's dbl:):)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 19 deðil 10 olacak pardon|pg||
nt|othered1: They seem to know what they were doing, however.|pg||
nt|liviu123: 17 is null 4H+1 |pg||
nt|ritong: okay, wipe all that:)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: but there is just no way west is underleading the @CK here|pg||

nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Bulletins.htm  -  Bulletins (PDF's|pg||
nt|mariner1: Work)|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he can certainly ruff @H if E cashes the K@C|pg||
nt|athene: are we still here?|pg||
nt|mariner1: ruff HIGH|pg||
nt|kaapo: A good point yes, you aren't really going anywhere (but trouble perhaps) by bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and where you know the result|pg||
nt|spaima: link for runing scores? |pg||
nt|athene: declarer doesn't know the @HA is right|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mariner1: E hoping there is a play that is hard to see, there isn't|pg||
nt|gracelin: the 3rd step 5NT should show 2 key cards without HQ, so West knows someting is still missing for the grand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did S miss?|pg||
nt|gh1: he sleep home now|pg||
nt|rodal f: @SA - and a new @C.|pg||
nt|yuval10: why? you can make some bet with your friends about it|pg||
nt|yuval10: like i bet the lead will be.....2@d|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think @S6|pg||
nt|mariner1: has few options though|pg||
nt|athene: true; he will probably have to play for that eventually|pg||
nt|athene: but will fiddle around a bit first|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't hurt to cash some tricks and watch the defenders wriggle :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|charles_l: maybe he distusts W's bidding 3@d|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: the Ace holding mr. Simonsen is now asking for a recapitulation of the bidding|pg||
nt|tomi2: this needs some "thorowaway" squeeze|pg||
nt|gracelin: but from east's point of view, if no key-card is missing, he wants to be in seven|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You win|pg||
pc|dT|nt|yuval10: lol i had a safety though, according to running scores|pg||
nt|ritong: nice lead, i wouldn t find it, thinking my pard has a positional opening, and thus a good @c suit|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|tomi2: west was probably asking for 3rd round kontrol in clubs and E thought he made no mistake and had this control and running tricks|pg||
nt|gracelin: good lead, save everybody time and energy|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: now mr Simonsen is asking for a recapitulation with his partner :)|pg||
nt|liviu123: it is on live score 2@D :)|pg||
nt|ritong: first move will certainly be cashing a top @d, then it will go faster|pg||
pc|c3|nt|MolvaM: türkiyenin maçýnýn verilip verilmeyeceði yarýn sabah belli olacak|pg||
nt|tomi2: would not be the best lead if E had club void|pg||
nt|rodal f: If @H was played defence needed to play @S before a new @C for 1 down. Not easy|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|raghavan: well made 4 - H goes in CA|pg||
nt|ritong: noone tried the zia joke?|pg||
nt|ritong: usually , 3@s shows a solid suit and asks for a @s stopper|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Hmmm? What's that|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ve günlül bültene bakarak görebilirsiniz|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tokay1975: oda olabilir ama  rakib icin avantaj o simdi hýzlý ve son karari rakibe birakti bastan x diyip 5h dese eger kontrlu oynamasi  gerekiyosa kontrlu oynar |pg||
nt|Walddk4: I know|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer is not happy to see the dummy, but he will feel better soon|pg||
pc|c2|nt|MolvaM: türkiye vugrafa çýkarsa da kapalý oda türkçe yoruma açýlacak|pg||
nt|po-s: if he has what Affe says - bal 16 -he probably raises me|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tokay1975: neticede  forcing pass  durumuna  girdi rakip 4h diyerek|pg||
nt|mikael_w: the 2 discards be W here was not the best|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s2|pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: He could have led anything but @CK for two defensive tricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kaapo: I suppose he must with 15-16|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ritong: zia s version is " hey mate i ve got a @s stopper  do you have a solid suit?"|pg||
nt|frusco: 8 for italy|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|davidb: 10|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kaapo: EW seem to like bidding 1NT a lot|pg||
nt|po-s: if you bid 1NT with these cards you must guess better|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ohhh, w got another chanse to discard right :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: declarer needs two diamond ruffs so he can pitch a heart on the @CJ and avoid the heart finesse|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kaapo: Arvidsson's opening 1NT on the previous board cost a few IMPs versus the 1@S contract that was played in the other room|pg||

nt|mikael_w: But why did S discard like rhis ?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|raghavan: Czech is now leading 42 v 23  > 19 lead|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think it's: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Results.htm|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk4: N-S have 4 tricks against a heart contract if they want them|pg||
nt|othered1: no room for pick-up here for Russia, barring a NS aberration.|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: 12 tricks - 2 losers|pg||
nt|gracelin: I only blame him for not doubling.|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: time for some more gazing at the ceiling|pg||
mb|2D|nt|tokay1975: splinter yapildiktan sonra  bunu kontrlamak bence mucize |pg||
nt|tokay1975: cok zor|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North led a trump next door, hence the overtrick|pg||
nt|hedyg: only 3 imps|pg||
nt|othered1: was 2@H specific to the black suits or was the minor ambiguous?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|davidb: 4 boards  to go -most of the swings -2 slams -normal   in a match between 2 good teams |pg||
nt|athene: perhaps 3@H is just too high in fact|pg||
nt|athene: redouble to play from south? :)|pg||
nt|athene: a modern idea is to use the redouble to show a different hand|pg||
nt|athene: you can either play that pass = 2 hearts only|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H = 3 hearts min|pg||
nt|athene: and xx = 3 hearts max|pg||
nt|athene: or you can play that 2@H = 3 hearts, positional|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 800 seyirciye ulaþtýk|pg||
nt|ronpa: look how agressive the young players are, both room bidding 1@H with north cards|pg||
nt|ritong: annoying|pg||
nt|ritong: strength is ok, but @s stopper is thin|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and xx = 3 hearts, prefers pd to play it|pg||
nt|athene: typically with something like @Dxxx|pg||
nt|athene: in case pd has a diamond tenace|pg||
nt|mariner1: REDBL must show a real NT and a fit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Seems strange that Emma did not raise|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Brasov/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=732&qroundno=14|pg||
nt|mariner1: -  Results this round|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thanks Rob|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Heya Rob :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: or a willingness to play @D I suppose|pg||
nt|athene: if north has a problem, the XX must be to play|pg||
nt|tomi2: 7@D on finding @DQ and this error and the match is close again|pg||
nt|kaapo: North has long support but no strength, shape, nor @C honours|pg||
nt|ritong: hi rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: sorry was sending to a kibber :)|pg||
nt|ritong: nice of you|pg||
nt|othered1: When I Michaels with the south hand, I regularly get the minor (especially @C) blown away.|pg||
nt|elbec: it should be @s and @c but i'm not very sure|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice slam here|pg||
nt|athene: hard for west to imagine it's actually his partner with the short hearts|pg||
mb|5H|nt|tomi2: could be a huge win for poland instead|pg||
nt|andy_h: A chance for Netherlands to pick up here - but it's hard to see where the 7th trick is going to come from|pg||
nt|liviu123: only if play @D on time :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: If they do not cash Clubs - will make 12. May not lead from CA xxx|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S worked well in Open Room|pg||
nt|athene: if it showed 3 hearts, north wld bid 2@H like a shot|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: where is this going?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: or 4 @S much better|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT=clubs and diamonds?|pg||
nt|ronpa: I doubt it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good question as to whether 2@C should be a UCB-type bid against Polish club|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe 3@s then pass anything|pg||
nt|ritong: but 4@h:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6 makes, 7 not|pg||
nt|charles_l: i like 4@d now|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: EW has a lucky 6D/6NT here.  But shouldn't be bid.|pg||
nt|kaapo: East is very maximum for his limited opening|pg||
nt|po-s: 4sp by Simon?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: the Swedes have nothing printed on the ceiling... the thinking is done by staring at the screen :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: 3 nt from W might have been better ?|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@c prob starts a get out sequence|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or youthful exuberance?|pg||
nt|poohbear: and South Quickly gets out :P|pg||
nt|ronpa: thats nice to see that even they respond that light they have the methods and dicipline to stop|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think North was trying to get out in 3@h|pg||
nt|poohbear: South knew better|pg||
nt|poohbear: Board 16 wasnt scored here. Norway has 5 more imps|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I saw|pg||
nt|ritong: meanwhile poles grabbed 10 imps finding a poetic moysian 6@s|pg||
nt|charles_l: wow 5@d|pg||
nt|mikael_w: looks like 5 @h will make here|pg||
mb|6D|nt|charles_l: i wonder if 2@c is GF @c or bal|pg||
nt|charles_l: it is a common treatment|pg||
nt|davidb: D  guess for the contract |pg||
nt|athene: i prefer to bid over 1NT with that west hand|pg||
nt|kaapo: I hope it's the sreen that divides that table and not your screen ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: lol, yes :)|pg||
nt|othered1: This is a not very lucky spot.  4@S on the west hand, however, is very pushy.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but you do need some sort of UCB in these positions|pg||
nt|elbec: 2 off with a @c ruff|pg||
nt|othered1: Unfavorable vul save will cost an imp|pg||
nt|rayhaa: 6@s save 150 toward 5@h|pg||
nt|rayhaa: 6@d|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: you can't go letting people play in 2@H when you have spades!|pg||
nt|mariner1: so Greece likely to pickup a dual part score swing here|pg||
nt|poohbear: severe comunication problems oin this hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: East isnt going anywhere|pg||
nt|eerbil: evet 4 daha|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 5@c after a short consultation of the system on the ceiling|pg||
mb|p|nt|syl: "You dont comment this bid???"-asks a kib|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: I dont have time to comment|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: nuclear war|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This may well roll in|pg||
nt|poohbear: I wonder if 3@c could have been a strong hand?|pg||
nt|ritong: not an everyday auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: If north leads a @h declarer will happily cash alot of tricks|pg||
nt|poohbear: on a @s lead declarer gets endplayed in hand|pg||
nt|othered1: no return looks attractive to north.  East likely hasn't guaranteed 5@S, so trump shift could be costly, too.|pg||
nt|othered1: as cards lie, @C is very effective|pg||
nt|othered1: And huge hitch may help east work out where things are.  Just won't be very helpful this time.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: LOl |pg||
nt|sybarra2: Bas are they playing with screens? |pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Yes|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Both above and underneath the table surface|pg||
nt|yuval10: only @d lead, or @c and @d shift, beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not so easy for the defence to cash their tricks in the right order|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and we also know that it makes!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Because Sweden have 6 more IMPs on the official scoreboard|pg||
nt|Walddk4: after board 18|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is nothing more than a recorded broadcast. Very annoying|pg||
nt|athene: most pairs have ways to show voids in these sort of auctions|pg||

mb|5H|nt|babydolldk: but why not bid 4@H instead of 3 if you are not going to cue bid?|pg||

nt|tomi2: heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Whee|pg||
nt|andy_h: 3@C preemptive would not be my choice with a constructive hand. But nevertheless, it's attractive because of w/r vulnerability and that partner's a passed hand|pg||

nt|Walddk4: No club lead at all :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: but whith Qxx in trumph N shod try to get the @s trick IF they have one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In fact, double dummy it makes on anything but a spade lead|pg||
pc|sT|nt|babydolldk: yes, you are right, just wondering if s had a @C cue, would they still have played 4@H, how could n know it was rigt to bid 4@H....|pg||
nt|babydolldk: 'right|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: still thinking...|pg||

nt|babydolldk: yes!|pg||
nt|le joker: bonjour tout le monde :)|pg||
nt|le joker: hi |pg||
nt|gracelin: 1H showed 3-card support, but strength unlimited.|pg||
nt|tomi2: don't know if they have some agreement on the double, it could be @D only or takeout on 1@H|pg||
nt|tomi2: west bid 1@S in case partner has support, he still had @Daxxx in bag in case he finds out partner has only dias and no spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: "MENSTRUATIESTOORNIS"|pg||
nt|tdrijverrr: lol|pg||

nt|ritong: you guys smoke tough stuff:)|pg||

nt|charles_l: can be 22(45) i guess|pg||

nt|athene: then partner knows you aren't just stretching to bid 3@D|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Puuhhh|pg||

nt|mariner1: yes proved to be :)|pg||
nt|ritong: have to hit same defender with @s KQ and @h QJ|pg||
nt|kastan88: slam time, 6 clubs here: 4 top tricks in side suits give away 1 @H and then crossruff. But that is not easy to find|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: Maybe E should've kept the @SJ, for W had only 4@S as well, this way he could've avoided W leading into Aces and a long suit|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|kaapo: Heart to queen would be declarer's 9th trick|pg||
nt|kaapo: @D to queen less succesful|pg||
nt|santyclz: Walter Johnson points out the top spot was probably defending 1@hx'd.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|mariner1: many thanks to all the sponsors and organizers for helping BBO bring us the|pg||
nt|mariner1: vugraphs!|pg||
nt|gracelin: Norway can sacrifice in 5D here to tie the match, or to push opponents to 5S for a win.|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C isn't natural|pg||
nt|capercliff: 2@c is 5-5 minors?|pg||
nt|capercliff: or precision type?|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: 2@c precision|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here 4@s will go 1 down|pg||
nt|capercliff: right tx|pg||
nt|xenya: good result for Italy from the OR|pg||

nt|kaapo: 6@D would need @Ds 2-2|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and I am sure there are many more to thank for bringing this to bbo vugraph |pg||
nt|Walddk4: No game makes on best defence|pg||
nt|yuval10: S elects to bid 4@h, which might very well be conventional|pg||
nt|yuval10: with perfect def. 4@h is going down 2|pg||
nt|po-s: maybe|pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at it!|pg||
nt|mariner1: also, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates, Sharon|pg||
nt|mariner1: Osberg, and David Smith. Without them there would have been no broadcasts.|pg||

nt|vugraphztr: thanks, bye|pg||
nt|poohbear: this should buy it|pg||
nt|eerbil: tebrikler gençlerimize|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Take away the 2000 (17 IMPs) and this woul've been a much closer match|pg||
nt|hedyg: thank you Adrian, great job|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: East downgrades somewhat - he has 11 HCP but it doesn't look good|pg||
nt|athene: he expects to need 9 fast tricks on a heart lead to make 3nt|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes its not a quality 11 at all|pg||
nt|MolvaM: önümüzdeki günlerde yapýlacak türkiye maçlarýnda gene birlikte olmak dileði ile|pg||
nt|ozgull: umarým bu maç milliler için çýkýþa geçme maçýdýr. Fena oynamadýlar baþarýlar diliyoruz|pg||
nt|kaapo: This time it is not so|pg||
nt|kaapo: The bidding might look Polish Club now|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@C could be a puppet to 2@D|pg||
nt|poohbear: thats one way to avoid slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: mirror 4333 shapes never play well|pg||
nt|charles_l: ty all|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mug: Open Room result by the way was 1NT +3|pg||
nt|athene: and he has no aces and no long suit...|pg||
nt|tomi2: so Poland will win this 16-14.  Thx to both teams for this interesting set|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, tough to find the sacrifice after 4S.  Yes, I agree with specs' comments that both pairs performed very well at their age.  They might be the future of our game.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, thanks Adrian|pg||
nt|charles_l: 17 and 2 10s seems heavy to me|pg||
nt|charles_l: for 1N|pg||
nt|mariner1: special thanks to all the spectators, those comments and tips really do help us a lot!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: double denied 4 spades, i assume, so 2@S is just offering to play the Moysian|pg||
nt|le joker: thanks all ! see you in 3rd match :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: ty all see U in an hour|pg||
nt|ritong: so, 44 imps gap|pg||
nt|tokay1975: tebrikler genclere|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps intending to show an invitational hand later|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Ty for help|pg||
nt|ronpa: look at the different view. other table West opened and east drove to slam. here west passed and east undervalued his 18 to 17 |pg||
nt|xenya: 3N by E now looks nice|pg||
nt|mikael_w: so This is the last board, Rhx to all the specs and thx to my fellow com. Ray and Charles|pg||
mb|p|nt|ozgull: 22 - 8 ile günü kapatmak  iyi moral tebrikler gençler|pg||
nt|yuval10: X should indicate @d lead |pg||
nt|hedyg: thanks to my fellow commentators, Arigun, Barry, Ron and Mike|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ritong: erm|pg||
nt|po-s: then 3D would  show his full hand (North´s)|pg||
nt|kaapo: If 2@C was a puppet to 2@D (including the option of passing 2@D), North's not bidding 2@D would show extra strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: imaginative 2@S bid from Bell, he has denied four of them, so 2@S shows three, maximum for his bidding, partner can work it out|pg||
nt|ritong: make that 36|pg||
nt|tomi2: next segment will be in 50 Minutes I rhink|pg||
nt|capercliff: well bid|pg||
nt|mikael_w: offcurse the @c A would ba a likely leed witch is not good|pg||
nt|athene: this should be two down, but the defence slipped up in the other room|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: taking the heart ruff in the short hand if partner has 4-3-3-3 or something like that|pg||
nt|po-s: I suggested 3D - would show extra AND his shape|pg||

nt|charles_l: esp ty to Florin|pg||
nt|rayhaa: thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: i'm glad everyone is enjoying these broadcasts|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mariner1: so E has an 11 worth less than face value|pg||
nt|fahir: tüm yorumculara teþekkürler, Brasov dan iyi akþamlar|pg||
nt|po-s: and would get a potential 3NT played by South|pg||
nt|kaapo: There might be trouble in 3@D if North hasn't shown real clubs yet|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps 1@S could be 18+ (or so) with 5+@S|pg||
nt|po-s: well, yes, who knows - do they have a convention card?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mariner1: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi   K&R|pg||
nt|tomi2: we will have Sweden - Latvia and Netherlands - France|pg||
nt|santyclz: Everybody sac with s?  It looks to me as if you have defense for 4@s with the @ca lead and a @h shift.|pg||
nt|athene: and allowed declarer to set up a complete crossruff|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mariner1: the good news here in N does not have a high @c pip|pg||

nt|capercliff: hard to settle for 4@s|pg||
nt|charles_l: @s lead?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Work)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: We all are Florin, and we all have you to thank for it, verry nice work you guys are doing|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kaapo: And there they are|pg||
nt|po-s: and North or South probably forgot what 2C was|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: massive consultations on both sides of the screen|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: in the OR N is in 3NT|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, yes, maybe they have to work on their CC a little bit more themselves, too|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: and made +3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ritong: i havent the VP scale under my eyes, presumably 21 or 22 VPs to frenchies|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmmm missed the @c switch for -1!|pg||
nt|charles_l: i think he's mistimed it now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: the defence can organize south a heart ruff but that doesn't help them enormously|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry i was in 4@s :(|pg||
nt|ritong: are you sure?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no :(|pg||
nt|ritong: ok|pg||

nt|kastan88: yes, good result for Latvia in Open room|pg||
nt|charles_l: yes|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|raghavan: S has to give atleast a Spade and 2Clubs|pg||

nt|hedyg: we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
pc|c2|nt|po-s: too many ace leads against slams|pg||
nt|kaapo: Not a great finish for an exiting and close match|pg||
nt|kaapo: Luckily this is the last board of the day|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kaapo: So NS have time to erase this mishap from their memories and start with a fresh day tomorrow|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gracelin: Thanks specs, Thomas, and the very capable VG operator Florin.  See you soon.|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: yes. 17.30 local|pg||

nt|po-s: interesting double by East...|pg||
nt|po-s: take that back - didn´t see the 2C-opening|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mug: @CK in fear of the heart ruff|pg||
nt|mariner1: well that play worked for S|pg||
nt|athene: pressure play from south!|pg||
nt|mug: but it may have cost him the contract|pg||
nt|athene: west doesn't want to lose to @CQ and then @C9 on the overruff and @CA@DA to come|pg||
nt|rayhaa: @d lead was good|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mug: don't think South would have played a trump from @CAxx|pg||
nt|yuval10: going down 1 now, it looks like|pg||
nt|arigun: thanks all from Brasov|pg||

nt|hedyg: bye for now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thanks all, see you soon|pg||
nt|ronpa: thx all|pg||
nt|ritong: amusing|pg||
pc|c7|pc|dA|nt|rodal f: And then 9 are on|pg||
nt|ritong: trump promo, but sgrouich|pg||
nt|poohbear: So looks like Israel will win this match 21-9 a very important victory over a team that was ahead of them|pg||
nt|poohbear: and France is losing to the Czech republic so the field is tightening a little|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: good lead & good defence Israel|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Israel on 5 place|pg||
nt|tdrijverrr: close match it is|pg||
nt|ritong: indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: good teams|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|mariner1: now he can lose 9@C in ruff too|pg||
nt|athene: if south really did have @CA9x and want a heart over-ruff, it would be more natural for him to try spades and diamonds to find partner's ace|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps lead a diamond simply to try to set up a diamond ruff for partner|pg||
nt|athene: so perhaps that small trump was suspicious - but not at all easy for declarer to be fair|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Likely flat and 18-12 to Sweden, meaning that France will be 13 VPs ahead of Norway ahead of their encounter in 1 hour and 25 minutes|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tdrijverrr: yes indeed|pg||
nt|tdrijverrr: next match i advise you to take Drijver_12  as commentator|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lokaty: :)|pg||
nt|pelu: better let @HK hold the first trick - here W lucky that N only had 2 1Ss|pg||
pc|s4|nt|capercliff: is the trump lead not obvious?|pg||
nt|ritong: thanks for the tip|pg||
nt|tdrijverrr: wont be dull    |pg||
nt|tdrijverrr: cu all|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Bye all, we'll be back in about 90 minutes!|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like a push|pg||

nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
pc|s8|nt|elbec: I hope you enjoyed this pure genuine match, full of energy and pathos|pg||

pc|sT|nt|rodal f: By all. See u later:)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mikael_w: another even board :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: You don't get the reputation as a world-class gift giver without misdefending the occasional game.|pg||
nt|athene: the defence was effectively identical in the other room - at the critical point, instead of playing a trump, west played a third diamond through declarer, trying to promote ...|pg||
nt|athene: something in hearts in his partner's hand|pg||
nt|capercliff: perhaps its easy for us when seeing all the cards|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: thanks all, see you in 1 hour and 15 minutes or so|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks all, bye for now.|pg||
nt|capercliff: thanks all|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|yuval10: very nice try by W|pg||
nt|vugraphztr: Norway on 3 place|pg||
