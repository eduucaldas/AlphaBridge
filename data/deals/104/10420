nt|ahollan1: so we're down to a 30 board match with Schwartz having a 1 Imp carryover  :)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|poohbear: Last segment here. We have Gaylor Kasle and Ron Smith NS  against Richie Scwartz and Bob Jones EW|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: if no @S now -- can try @H33 or finesse @SQ -- I think that better than 75%|pg||

mb|p|nt|poohbear: 5@ds best here . Needs 3-2 trumps and spades setting up. 3NT will go down on a @h lead. 4@s needs 3-3 spades or the Q @ds falling|pg||

nt|Vugraphu5: this was going to be your first seniors trials??  and you missed it!|pg||

nt|ahollan1: when would it be wrong to try @C9?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=10-15 HCP, (a) 6+@C, 1-suit  (b) 4+@C and 5+@S|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 2@c = NAT (they play Ultimate Club)|pg||
nt|poohbear: Fast pass to 1NT here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pab1: seems like an unlikely pass by NOrth|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drew wants a recount|pg||
nt|pab1: same number of tricks, even if Club 9 is covered|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: akxxx/xx/xx/AJxx they open 2clubs|pg||
nt|imp_jan: or 1n (as in the first quarter) ;)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL=PUP 2@D, (a) @D (b) 5+@H & 3+@S|pg||
nt|poohbear: yup|pg||
nt|kareno: So 13 boards to go and a 33 IMP deficit - that's a lot of work for the Kasle team.|pg||
nt|kareno: South has nothing to think about really :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|c4|nt|pab1: also odd, that Grqanovetter didn't overcall 1NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm  i wonder if they flipped the board direction|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: I think my board doesn't match their auction, yikes!|pg||
nt|pab1: director, please!|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: figured it out...they are playing  39|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another hand for my never-to-be-finished book "What's Going On?"|pg||
pc|c8|nt|poohbear: what do you think of 1NT as opposed to dbl , Peter?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if one table isn't enough -- http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   then one window per room|pg||
nt|pab1: Same play Sandwich NT, for takeout, but you get stolen from too often, IMHO|pg||
nt|kareno: With that north hand, Toronto's Irv Litvack would do well by making one of his usual safe leads.  |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|poohbear: I like 1NT even though there is no @c stop. Gets the strength across and the pattern|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: if telling the truth - NS play standard signals|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pab1: i would have doubled, with 4-4 in reds|pg||
nt|poohbear: That would be Joey silver's former partner |pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C3 probably didn't really force the @CQ|pg||
nt|pab1: double seems pretty normal|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|pab1: However, 1NT probably makes the auction easier for partner|pg||
nt|pab1: I would make a negative double with Ekeblad's hand -- not wanting to sell out with a singleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: making it easier for partner - is that allowed?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|poohbear: and like Joey, quite a character|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|s6|pg||
nt|poohbear: I agree  but on this hand it doesnt work out well unless partner makes an  " enlightened " pass|pg||
pc|c2|nt|poohbear: Declarer not messing around in 1NT. Started @hs from hand|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easier for East to be enlightened if his partner showed hand via DBL instead of 1N - but still probably not enough to get into auction|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, quite a character.  With some very quirky ideas about the game ... a high sense of sportsmanship, a real gentleman.|pg||
mc|8|nt|Vugraphu5: table taking a smoke break|pg||
nt|pab1: seems he would have gone down down without Heart Ace cash, no?|pg||
nt|poohbear: yea|pg||
nt|ahollan1: peter cheating - thinks 6 tricks for defense is better than 5|pg||

nt|Vugraphu5: that is what happened....|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Eke saying low diamonds showed club interest.   Gran says we don't play Lavinthal|pg||
nt|pab1: guess he was playing declarer for QJx of CLubs and no Heart King|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the Open Trials   Granovetter played with Ron Rubin, Ekeblad played with Peter Weicshel|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Gran:  let's discuss the hands over Chivas Regal.   Eke:  maybe we should have the Chivas now|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3NT and 4@h both acceptable games|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kareno: Irv is a good counterpoint to Joey :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=good 14-17|pg||
nt|poohbear: prob play 4@h after a weak 2|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: NS playing what looks like pretty standard 2/1|pg||
nt|poohbear: though Smith may choose not to invite|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: Jan - isn't there a big tournament this week in your part of the world?|pg||
nt|poohbear: or he might just bid it :P|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW play Ultimate Canape - expect a lot of alerts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if things settle down, you can watch multiple tables using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   [one window per room]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no progress on this hand -- that can't be good|pg||
nt|imp_jan: here we go again|pg||
nt|imp_jan: sometimes connection problems|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|kareno: Falling into Smith's trap :)  But the west hand, under pressure, is the one that can act.|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: we always have biarritz and deauville bridge festivals in france in july|pg||
nt|imp_jan: i usually frequent those (follow the oyter season) |pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: Looks like a Chivas break hand for the audience|pg||
mb|p|nt|pab1: Drewski helped his partner lead, but it didn't matter|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Drewski: what is your definition of 14+.   Eke:  a couple of 109's,  a five card suit.  we don't psyche 1N we try to play bridge.  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Granovetter helped us by transferring to Ekeblad [Russ plays faster than Matt]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if win @D and shift to @C - time to setup @S for @C pitch|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Drewski:  sorry|pg||
nt|poohbear: Drew will probably switch to a @c hoping declarer has the @d Q instead of the @s Q|pg||
nt|pab1: drew may be thinking about underleading second round of Diamonds, for a Spade through.|pg||
nt|poohbear: or might just go passive|pg||
nt|poohbear: even though we know its boring. Drew doesnt|pg||
nt|pab1: Playing Declarer for xxx/AKx/Jxx/AQJx|pg||
nt|kareno: He knows his partner has a singleton or void heart.|pg||
nt|kareno: Very good timing by Ron Smith in this auction.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|poohbear: question is can the defense punish to the max|pg||

nt|poohbear: Some would say East is way too good to Preempt at favorable vul|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|kareno: So Jones will lose (my guess) a heart, two clubs and one or two spades depending on his view in that suit.  The lead gave up nothing.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: K&R said west hand on board 20 was worth 17.70 -- so Matt had choice of 1N [good14-17] or 1@C[16+unbal or 18+ bal]|pg||
nt|imp_jan: and of course i believe mid july there is the chairman's cup in oerebroe, sweden|pg||
nt|imp_jan: russ upgraded his hand here: 2 10's|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu5: Eke:  we are getting a lot of relays|pg||
mb|1N|nt|imp_jan: 2@C showing both majors|pg||
nt|imp_jan: Matt loves it|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Do you have a preferred method to use when opponents overcall 1NT?|pg||
nt|poohbear: 6 more to Schwartz on 48 where EW played 3nt down 1 in the other room|pg||
nt|kareno: With the south hand I bid 2 of partner's minor for the majors.|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like Kasle and Smith use the other minor for Stayman.|pg||
nt|poohbear: I just like 2@c for the majors|pg||
nt|poohbear: Often you want to support a real @d suit|pg||
nt|kareno: I bid partner's minor because you sort of never want to raise that suit only to two :)  Three, yes, and you still can.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: 2@C conventional after 1N overcall from RHO -- i like that concept|pg||
nt|poohbear: Drew might be right but if they get too high it would be his fault|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: 2@D|pg||
nt|robinswr: some play other minor for the majors some play capp|pg||
nt|imp_jan: of course|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now partnership test -- did West DBL establish a force|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: Matt leaves no doubt :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: 4-1-4-4 12 points opp modern openers is not a game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :(  I was just about to comment about how there haven't been any alerts for EW Ultimate Canape system|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu5: Ons:  I hope you make it|pg||
nt|pab1: i would bid 1 Spade with Onstott's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: me too|pg||
pc|d3|nt|poohbear: 4H isnt bad on the auction. Wouldnt make though|pg||
nt|poohbear: Needs to have @ds come in for 1 loser|pg||
nt|poohbear: NS can go plus here |pg||
pc|d4|nt|imp_jan: diamond lead..|pg||
nt|imp_jan: Ron Smith bid lead directing :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3nt will not make but they do have a 9-card club fit which if clubs were 2-2 would make 5clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will Ron Smith try @S or @D2?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: of course he leads diamonds|pg||
nt|robinswr: his partner did not bid a major so why wouldn't he lead a diamond|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are we sure we know that 2@C was absolutely @H & @S?|pg||
nt|robinswr: but opening leads are difficult|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then again - it sounds like Granovetter holds @H & @S also -- so that should help find @D|pg||
nt|imp_jan: does ron knows he is on lead?|pg||
nt|reisig: Ron ALWAYS knows :)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: ok, so then we have to wait a littlbit longer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Matt's table finished almost 5 boards ahead of other room in Q1 -- maybe Ron trying to slow things down :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: nothing to be ashamed of|pg||
nt|poohbear: might have game in @Hs @ss or NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I would open 1@S before I passed 1@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Drew:  you opened a 10 count  (joking about @CK)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Drew and Eke are having an extended critique of Onstott's bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially If 1@D-1@H;1@S shows unbal hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: are they both trashing him?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Drew approves,  Eke doesn't.   |pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Drew:  pass = 100% in my book|pg||
nt|pab1: 4 Spades looks like it might depend on the lead|pg||
nt|poohbear: Drew ALWAYS sticks up for his partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right -- especially at the table!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|imp_jan: the moe south thinks the less like he is to lead a diamond|pg||
nt|imp_jan: there he is|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Drew wants to know about 10's in the middle of the hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: partner uber alles|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Q1 results from Chip:  Vernay 19, Larsen 5  ;  Lynch 17 Epstein 22 ; Morse 48 Wojowoda 18|pg||
pc|s3|nt|poohbear: I assume the @s finesse in 4@H cause of the NT opening|pg||
nt|poohbear: overcall|pg||
nt|kareno: Inferential lead by north will get him a ruff and there will still be a diamond trick to the defense.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Schwartz just closed the slot to ask Smith a question|pg||
pc|s7|nt|robinswr: i like to lead 3rd 5th in partner's suit because sometimes you have only 3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS do play Smith Echo -- but named for a different Smith|pg||
nt|poohbear: Defense can take 2@s and a ruff or 2@s and a @h |pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|robinswr: ekeblad does not like his chances|pg||
pc|h2|nt|imp_jan: so @H4 is Smith?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|imp_jan: and i don't like his 1n overcall|pg||
nt|robinswr: if smith is playing smith he should have played the 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right Jan |pg||
nt|robinswr: if he is playing reverse smith then he should have played the 2|pg||
nt|poohbear: cant get everything|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: system summary just says "smith echo"|pg||
pc|h6|nt|imp_jan: so we may conclude that Smith is not at stake here|pg||
nt|imp_jan: ohw|pg||
nt|robinswr: when you signal you should always signal with the highest card you can afford (but don't blow a trick signaling)|pg||
nt|stew: i too would rebid 1s  too many options H, S, NT 4S may even make on heartQ lead or D 10|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: so the issue here - did Ron think he could NOT afford the @H9|pg||
nt|imp_jan: true|pg||

nt|imp_jan: lol|pg||
nt|imp_jan: bu the will|pg||
nt|pab1: invitational stayman sounds reasonable|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3NT is easy on this hand but only cause partner has a good fit for @cs and perfect prime fitting cards|pg||
nt|stew: vul game  Yes we bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: what is 1N?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=FG, opening+ unbal [not 1@D/1@H/1@S]|pg||
nt|robinswr: controls i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other bids would have shown 3 places to play, so this unbal 1-suit or 2-suit|pg||
nt|robinswr: better to hear from someone who has their notes|pg||
mb|1N|nt|imp_jan: 4 controls i learned (1n)|pg||

nt|poohbear: I lose :(|pg||
pc|s5|nt|USBF: lovely! :(|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3 key cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they play different forms of ace asking -- i'm not really sure which applies here, but looks like 3|pg||
nt|robinswr: my guess is that 3hearts turned this auction into a standard auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: this auction explained as INV,  doesn't promise Major|pg||
nt|poohbear: dbl prob showed 4of a major and 5+ of a minor   OR  just @ds|pg||
pc|s3|nt|imp_jan: 5@H asks for trumpqueen and side kings now (when i play witj myself)|pg||
nt|poohbear: though Granovetter might have bid if partner showed a major|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|h8|nt|imp_jan: right|pg||

nt|poohbear: Declarer prob dbl hooks the @c|pg||
nt|pab1: that's percentage, and entries seem to work|pg||

nt|kareno: Makes just 3.  Time for a nice cup of tea ... (_)? ... and some cookies ... OOOO ... anyone?|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 6@H last trainish|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|poohbear: playing the ace gains against KQ dbltn but loses to KQx onside|pg||
nt|kareno: But now he's a Senior :)|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dA|nt|poohbear: 11 imps to Kasle on the hand where Schwartz played 4@s dbled. 3NT failed in the other room|pg||
pc|h2|nt|imp_jan: I have the feeling that east shld have bid the grand after 6@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but removes guess when J floats to East honor -- play for restricted choice or not|pg||

nt|kareno: For the specs, losing this match doesn't end the tournament for those teams.  There is a repechage and the remaining teams will play further knockout matches to select a team to ...|pg||
nt|kareno: play the loser of the finals.  Possibly they select three teams for a further KO - Barry, do you know the exact formula?|pg||
nt|robinswr: if your're going to open that hand, you have to rebid 2clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: anybody bid over 1@S with West hand?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: i would|pg||
nt|imp_jan: which says nothing...|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|poohbear: I agree Steve|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu5: Eke: this is a 3@H bid but I didnt want to risk it.... on by PH|pg||

pc|c5|pg||

nt|poohbear: good 4@s game here on light high card points|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu5: Gran asks what 2@D is,  then asks if Ons, discussed it...(yes!)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: how many in the panel use 2@D over a "could be short" as Natural?|pg||
nt|poohbear: can be beat since 3 out of 3 cards off side but if the defense finds it they would probably be jailed:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Drew alerted 2@D but I can't read it....then Eke alerted 2@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: another hand were seeing all 52 cards we can count 13+ tricks -- how close will NS get??|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but later bid with clarify slam ambition|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: 3nt seems like a stretch to me|pg||
nt|kareno: Gee, why not lead your best suit?|pg||
nt|robinswr: because sometimes the king is on your right|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: of course if you played bridge on East coast in late 70s/early 80s .....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lublin's Law:  4N IS Blackwood :)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: i get a lot of chats, all different answers :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we THINK  4N = choice of 5@C/5@D  so 5@C just says prefer @C|pg||
nt|poohbear: A lot of experts play 2@d natural over a short @d and 2@h as non forcing Michaels ( 5-5 majors) and 3@d as GOOD Michaels|pg||
mb|p|nt|stew: we simply play 2D = natural|pg||
pc|c8|nt|imp_jan: that is how i play it|pg||

pc|c9|nt|pab1: we still play michaels, even if "could be short"|pg||

pc|d9|nt|poohbear: hard to envision a slam though|pg||

mb|p|nt|poohbear: 3NT has chances on a non @h lead. 5@d might be a stretch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another benefit of checkback -- 1@S rebid can confirm 4+@D [some say 1@S guarantees unbal hand]|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pab1: tough choice for South.  Clubs well stopped for 3NT, but no apparent source of nine tricks|pg||

nt|stew: trump back?|pg||
nt|pab1: might come home on a complete cross ruff, if no trump shift now|pg||
nt|poohbear: the curse of Scotland might prevent 11 tricks now on a trump back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose 1st 2 tricks could have Granovetter original holding @CJ872  [3rd even/low odd] -- can Ostott account for that possibility?|pg||
nt|stew: yes  must shift to a trump else 11 tricks|pg||
nt|poohbear: curse of Scotland ( 9@d)|pg||
nt|poohbear: if West plays a plain card it helps declarer get 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|poohbear: Ace of @hs was an important entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D has Curse of Scotland and The Beer Card, @S has Big & Little Casino -- what about the poor round suit spots??|pg||
nt|stew: hooking the club isn't any good .. it get's you the club trick, but you must draw 3 rounds of trump for it to survive and then you just dan't get to 11|pg||
nt|poohbear: on a non trump return Declarer will pitch a @c on the spade and cross ruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Gran: sorry.  Drew:  I am sure we have plenty of time|pg||
nt|pab1: One entry short, to dummy, if a trump is led now.|pg||
nt|stew: nothing is going anywhere.  100% he will shift to a trump|pg||
nt|poohbear: It was sort of a non play to play a @h to lead a @s down since if the ace is onside there would be a @c ruff. Though it is possible that the long @cs were with the opening leader|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Gran is leaning sideways in his chair, knit eyebrows,  hand on chin|pg||
nt|pab1: If 8 and 6 of Diamonds were switched, the 7 of Diamonds would provide the needed entry|pg||

nt|kareno: And thanks to the specs for keeping us on our toes :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|poohbear: prob just tries 3@h. Doesnt want to get past 3NT but has a good hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: but he opts past 3NT|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|h3|nt|poohbear: this will get them there|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: one of hands for 1@D is canape with 5+@S -- maybe Kasle thought of that -- or just didn't like non-forcing bid in 4 card suit|pg||
pc|d7|nt|poohbear: 5@c needs either 2-2 trumps with @h no worse than 4-2  or 3-3 @h with trumps no worse than 3-1|pg||
pc|c4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|imp_jan: looks like a make now|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: board 28 interesting 14 imp swing|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pab1: and another potential gain for Schwartz|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Thanks to Karen & Barry for keeping this interesting!|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer has 2 lines. One:  ruff a @d in dummy or he can draw trumps and play a @d to the 9|pg||
nt|kareno: @h|pg||
nt|poohbear: finessing the 10|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|imp_jan: yes indeed|pg||
nt|poohbear: Dont think 5@c makes|pg||
nt|poohbear: Ruffing a @d needs 4-3 @ds or 5-2 with the 5 on the right so thats better than a 50 - 50 finesse|pg||
pc|c8|nt|imp_jan: and we were discussing the overtrick in 5@C :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: no good break in either key suit|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: 30 more boards to play today -- next set scheduled [keyword] to begin in about 1 hour 40 minutes|pg||
nt|poohbear: just pointing out options|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mittmouse: interesting if declarer had the 6 of h that suit plays naturally for 3 tricks|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: thanks to our very patient operator Dan Wolkowitz|pg||
pc|h2|nt|poohbear: sorry dreaming here:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: thanks all,  I will leave the table open, since other room still playing, |pg||
nt|pab1: thanks, all|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5@c just needs no worse than 4-2 @h|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: hope to see you later, bye|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: In just a couple of minutes|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
