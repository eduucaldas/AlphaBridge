mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|imp_jan: this might end in 4@H|pg||
nt|kareno: A part-score battle looms here, hearts vs spades with no game available.|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: morse might not quit, since partner assumed to have doubleton spade|pg||
mb|3C|nt|imp_jan: amazingly north did not interfere in spades|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 2@S = relay|pg||
nt|imp_jan: and 3@H = min, 4crd support..|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: These part scores are terribly important.  The team that gets the better of the part score results has a big leg up on winning the match.|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: no 3@d|pg||
nt|kit: good bid IMO -- one doesn't win bridge matches letting opponents play in 2@S when they have a fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Meltzer's 2@s probably her weakest raise.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|imp_jan: showing a 4crd support, which is enough for west to know|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kareno: Agreed.  North didn't raise either of south's 'bid' suits but likely has three cards in one or other (or as here, both)|pg||
nt|kit: if East plays 3 rounds of spades then declarer will have to make unusual play of small club from dummy (rather than the ace) to protect against the trump promotion|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|imp_jan: wow, what a double|pg||
nt|imp_jan: no was a typo :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: said to be 4th|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||
nt|kit: And I don't see why Larsen wouldn't continue 3 rounds of spades -- nothing else is attractive|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|s7|nt|imp_jan: things go well for declarer in the first 2 tricks (diamond attack)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|kit: good defense -- now let's see how tough Morse is|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kit: not sure why he played hearts first -- this seems to just expose himself to possible heart ruff|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
nt|imp_jan: the way she plays the hearts, she is still in control|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|imp_jan: meanwhile the first brd was a samll swing indeed|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|imp_jan: a kibitzer rightfully remarked that John Solodar should have played @H8 at first opportunity (which he didn't )|pg||
nt|imp_jan: Rose will end up with 3 diaomnds, 4 hearts, a spade and 2 clubs..|pg||
nt|imp_jan: still she is not sure about the diamonfd position|pg||
nt|imp_jan: hardly any other chances then @d 3-3 |pg||
nt|imp_jan: open room 4@h was made as we see now|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: has pulled a card several times but still thking|pg||
nt|kit: and now the promotion|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c7|pc|cJ|mc|8|nt|kareno: Spade for the uppercut.  But this could have been avoided as Kit explained.|pg||

mb|p|nt|kareno: Would you intervene over 1nt with the west hand, Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: of course|pg||
mb|1N|nt|imp_jan: a high spade contract is possible here|pg||
nt|pef: solodar and swanson are really an old-time partnership|pg||

nt|imp_jan: and steve|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: congrats for qualification for sao paulo|pg||
nt|pef: seems like they will land in 4s on any reasonable auction here|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|USBF: welcome, Steve :)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: Rose didn't value her hand as an opening|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 1N, really?|pg||
nt|pef: do they reverse the 1s and 1nt response to 1h, or are they playing 4 card majors?|pg||
nt|kareno: I ask because I surely would (especially with the 3-1 distribution in the minors).  I see Rose Meltzer chose not to.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: ruisnow std carding smith|pg||
nt|kit: look at it this way -- if partner opened a 8-10 1NT, say, would you pass on the West hand?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|imp_jan: actually i would have bid 1@S as North|pg||
nt|pef: I'll take a look|pg||
nt|imp_jan: pls do|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: no alerts|pg||
nt|pef: or possibly they plan flannery and was just pointed out by a spec.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|robinswr: another 7222 hand, the 3rd of the match |pg||
nt|imp_jan: not that it matters much here|pg||
nt|robinswr: i would bid 1spade also|pg||
nt|robinswr: lead director|pg||
nt|robinswr: usually you need 6 points to bid here|pg||
nt|imp_jan: wow, that is really the good ol' US style|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pef: if they play flannery, normally a 1s response shows 5|pg||
nt|kareno: Never :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: Well, it's basically the same thing -- defending 1NT is contracting for 7 tricks in notrump, same as declaring 1NT|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|pef: yes, they play flannery, good catch from bobby levin in the spec. world|pg||
nt|pef: since presumably the 1h opening denied most of the time 4 spades, south normally has 5 for a 1s response.  north does have 4s, but he's too good for a flannery 2d opening|pg||
nt|kareno: And as west you are 'balancing live,' meaning you are bidding as if in fourth chair after two passes.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: Morse may regret spending the 9 of diamonds there|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pef: so not quite good old style :)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c2|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s9|nt|pef: swanson and solodar play mostly standard 2/1 (with flannery).  They lead lower of touching honors against suits|pg||
nt|imp_jan: we hardly play that in Europe, but I can see the logic behind it|pg||
nt|pef: meltzer and larsen play pretty standard 2/1|pg||
nt|pef: the only a bit unusual things they play are transfer when one of a major by their side gets doubled and transfers over opponents 1nt|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|c6|pg||

nt|kit: Larsen felt he had to guard clubs -- but meltzer had no need to lay down ace of hearts if she were leading a heart|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|kit: After 2@S raise, Larsen will probably have to double and then bid 3@H over 3@D|pg||
mb|2S|mb|2N!|an|michaels|nt|kareno: n/s can make 2@s, e/w some clubs.  |pg||
nt|kareno: 2NT I assume is 'two places to play'|pg||
nt|kit: aha -- a different approach, and one which will work better (at least will not land in 3@H)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|kit: Problem with this is they can't stop in 3@C which is the ideal place|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: although vul. at imps, n/s might decide to sell out to 2h here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Michaels - nice treatment.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: would you bid 2s at that point with solodar's hand, jan?|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: is north thinking?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: y|pg||
nt|imp_jan: and if so, why?|pg||
nt|kit: I think 4@S may have problems on diamond lead, but will probably not get that|pg||
mb|3H|nt|pef: seems like he'll bid 1h|pg||
nt|pef: or 2h :)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: there is the answer|pg||
nt|pef: I guess they play weak jump shifts by passed hands although not on their card on the usbf site|pg||
nt|imp_jan: nowadays it is common practice to play that as 3-6 hcp, 6crd|pg||
nt|pef: in the open room, east opened a weak 2 spades, south bid 4nt for minors and they ended up in 5c down 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|kit: unless Morse sticks in a 3@D call -- amazing how that works|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: the 2h bid may keep ns lower here|pg||
nt|imp_jan: however in this situation, when opps already had the opportunity to interfere, it was not really imparitive..|pg||
nt|imp_jan: club lead...|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|pef: 3nt is an interesting contract, on a club lead declarer has 8 tricks and west is going to be under some pressure|pg||
nt|imp_jan: wow, Kyle does not belive iit|pg||
nt|pef: larsen agressively doubles for a heart lead, I guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: from his point of view understandble|pg||
nt|kareno: Rose loves her hand.  I assume this is some sort of slam try.|pg||
nt|kit: The 3@H call was search for better strain -- but it has the disadvantage of keeping North away from a fatal heart lead|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: definitely not a slam try -- not close|pg||
nt|kit: key play here -- if she plays small, which she might, she could be in trouble|pg||
pc|c3|nt|imp_jan: well a heart lead was much better than a club lead|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|pef: still, quite a double, declarer easily could have 9 tricks outside the heart suit|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pef: great lead by rose|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: i may have bid a bit oo much says swanson|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d9|nt|kit: Now no entry to dummy, and the tap danger|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|pef: however declarer should still come to 10 tricks if he plays the club suit carefully|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s5|nt|pef: hmm|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|pef: well that wasn't best|pg||
nt|pef: seems like it would have been far better to just give up a spade, planning on losing 2 spades and a club|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|imp_jan: trump six or seven is an entree if a trump comes back|pg||

pc|d8|pc|sJ|nt|imp_jan: there we are|pg||
nt|kit: she can still recover with a good heart guess|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pc|h8|nt|imp_jan: so a push in the end|pg||
nt|pef: i don't undestand declarer's play at all, seems clearly right to just plan to ruff a spade and hold clubs to one loser|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|pef: no, he's off two, jan|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 2 down?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: yes|pg||
nt|pef: he lost a spade, 2c clubs, a club ruff, and a heart|pg||
nt|kit: and she might, since dropping Qx of hearts doean't help|pg||
nt|kit: North made nice falsecard of 10 of hearts -- and it worked -- gave her a losing option|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|d5|pg||
mc|8|nt|kareno: All correct.  But she's lost this contract.|pg||

nt|kit: This is a good example of a hand which looks trivial when you can see all 4 hands, without realizing the potential pitfalls involved for declarer who can see only 2 hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: he still could have ruffed a club i thought|pg||
nt|imp_jan: anyhow|pg||
nt|pef: no, rose had a chance to lead another trump|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kareno: Do they allow partnerships to comment on the same match?  <giggle>|pg||
nt|kit: hi Fred|pg||
nt|stew: hi Karen, Kit ... I promise to keep all my disputes with Kit to myself|pg||
mb|2H|nt|imp_jan: yes, true|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kit: Morse rather conservative bidding only 2@H -- gave Meltzer a chance to splinter|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|kit: Larsen will like his hand a lot opposite the splinter -- I think he will drive it to slam -- but doesn't look like slam will make|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: declarer has to guess the heart suit|pg||
nt|pef: best defense beats best offense on this hand.  1nt should go down several|pg||
mb|5H|nt|pef: even if she guesses the suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|imp_jan: otherwise south comes in and plays though the diamonds|pg||
nt|pef: good play by rose there|pg||
nt|stew: actually it might due to the big club spots in dummy|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|nt|pef: she takes the best play for 5 heart tricks|pg||
nt|imp_jan: on her way|pg||
nt|kit: yes, if declarer takes that approach rather than the crossruff approach|pg||
nt|kit: remember, Wolff doesn't have to rise ace of clubs on first round of clubs -- and he shouldn't|pg||
nt|kit: I think declarer will ruff the opening lead and play a club off -- and then we shall see what happens|pg||
nt|kareno: He really needs another trump in that dummy.  Nine trumps are soooo much better than eight.|pg||
nt|kit: best defense appears to be North playing low, South ruffing and leading a trump|pg||
nt|kit: well, sometimes you have to make do with 8.  This is a pretty good slam|pg||
nt|kareno: Just perhaps not as the cards lie.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|imp_jan: btw, some would/could interfere over 1n|pg||
nt|pef: really?  she just undid all the good she did by her play to this point|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3 red is on|pg||
nt|pef: seems like overtaking the king of spades and taking the marked heart finesse gets her to 7 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: I think declarer will have to go after the clubs, since he doesn't have the spade spots to ruff 3 spades in dummy|pg||
pc|h4|nt|imp_jan: she believed @HJ as a false card??|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: 3 hearts, I mean|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|pef: even so, this is imps|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kit: so maybe it was wrong to ruff the first heart -- not clear|pg||
nt|kareno: An extra dummy entry with this lead if declarer chooses.|pg||
nt|kit: Morse trying to chop down dummy's entries -- he doesn't know the club position|pg||
nt|kit: declarer knows the clubs won't work now, so he will go for the crossruff -- which fails since the third round of diamonds doesn't cash|pg||
nt|kit: also, he can't get back to his hand since his spade spots are weak|pg||
nt|kit: so from his point of view, there doesn't seem to be a winning line|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pef: wow|pg||
pc|d2|nt|imp_jan: but if you make 1n by guessing hearts, u might as well bid 4@H|pg||

pc|c8|nt|imp_jan: declarer's not at all|pg||
nt|imp_jan: defensive a little better|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pef: well at any rate, she's still going to make 1nt for a one imp loss and the match will be back to tie|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: sorry lost track with the undo|pg||

nt|stew: For those of you who don't know.  that's a recurring theme with kit.  The riddle "What do you call AKQJxx?"  |pg||
nt|kit: Larsen is afraid that if he leads the ace of spades that might give away the club position|pg||
nt|stew: The answer of course "TRUMP"|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sK|pg||
nt|kit: However, I think it is the right lead -- just let the trumps take care of themselves -- he would make the same lead with a stiff small club|pg||
nt|kit: danger in not cashing ace of spades is that there are discards -- declarer might cash ace-king of clubs, planning to then discard losing spades|pg||
nt|kit: The king of spades could be a falsecard from Kxx, so seems like he should continue spades|pg||
nt|kareno: Larsen may not want to remove dummy's trump to give declarer another losing option.|pg||
nt|kit: diamond shift might be right if declarer is 1-1 in spades and diamonds, but that doesn't seem likely|pg||
nt|kit: after all, West did raise to 4@H|pg||

nt|Vugraphu8: rose says she thought kyle had ak tight of spades|pg||
nt|stew: ok  more action?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|pab1: at other table, Dan Morse declared 6H.  South led Spade 4, but North did not fly Ace. |pg||
mb|1H|nt|kareno: So five of a minor on this hand is the winner.  Six can be made with two good guesses and five can go down with none :)|pg||
nt|kit: I consider 1@H and insufficient bid|pg||
nt|kareno: I prefer 2@h with the west hand.|pg||
mb|d|nt|pab1: Dan got partial count, then guessed Clubs correctly|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|kareno: 4@s also possible with the ruffs in the short hand.|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S is best N-S contract, and they might negotiate it if not too much interference|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: yes, just checked that, though not so clear.. (for me)|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|kit: So, is this double penalties, takeout, or just forcing partner to make the wrong decision?|pg||
nt|kareno: Surely that is tempting with the south hand.|pg||
nt|kareno: Your partner has real extra values and four spades.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|imp_jan: so a possible swing to Morse|pg||
nt|imp_jan: on the other hand: south had a stiff heart, so theory of open places makes him favorite to have 3 clubs|pg||
nt|pab1: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|stew: ohhhh now  they are there|pg||
nt|kit: nice bid -- and now they do get to the best spot|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: so partial count helped indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: X seems odd...since he's likely on lead|pg||
nt|imp_jan: get a lot of questions from kibitzers, unable to give all the answers right now|pg||
nt|pab1: 4D probably RKC|pg||
mb|p|nt|pab1: Pass by Meltzer might deny Diamond control|pg||
nt|reisig: and @s ace too...prob|pg||
nt|pab1: Redouble now to continue RKC ask|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: kyle thinking... no questions asked here at all|pg||
nt|pab1: If you know you are going to bid a slam anyway, it can be a good idea to bid BW with a void, to confuse the opponents|pg||
nt|reisig: My guess is 6@h or 6@c....prob 6@h|pg||
nt|imp_jan: if he goes all the way, it will be in hearts for sure|pg||
nt|pab1: chances are better in 6H, since you can delay the Club guess.  East doesn|pg||
nt|pab1: doesn't necessarily know that|pg||
nt|imp_jan: many chats on 4@d|pg||
nt|reisig: Couldn't Rose have no @c K?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: we dont know|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|imp_jan: either kickback (rkc) or cue|pg||
nt|kit: After two rounds of hearts, declarer will take a club finesse before drawing trumps so if minors are bad he can handle a third round of hearts ruffing in short hand|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
nt|imp_jan: hm, how wrong i was|pg||
nt|imp_jan: to sure about 6@h|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kareno: Declarer won't pull trumps until he plays on a minor.|pg||
nt|stew: when declarer gets tapped playing on clubs doesn't require finding the diamond|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pab1: I see no reason for him to get Clubs right.  |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|stew: so much for the tap|pg||
nt|kareno: With that shift, it is a cold game.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: Diamond shift reasonable -- she knows another heart won't cash, but if declarer opened super-light partner might have AQ of diamonds|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|reisig: Nice lead :)|pg||
