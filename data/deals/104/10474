nt|andyv:  lot of work for S|pg||
nt|sharynr: As much as East would like to balance, he does not really have a bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: E will just take his +|pg||
nt|jwit: I actually might have considered overcalling 1S over 1D with the East hand.  Once he didn't do that, I would not enter the auction over 1NT|pg||

nt|vugraphztn: slip of mind .. not my fault this time ...|pg||
nt|andyv:  that probably is a pretty good result|pg||
nt|jwit: Surely should be.  Only possible loss of matchpoints would be if EW enter the fray and go for 200 or more|pg||

nt|vugraphztn: 4@d is Trelde|pg||
nt|Walddk2: asking bid|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: 4nt is control and 2 aces|pg||
nt|sybarra: asking what?|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok |pg||
nt|Walddk2: diamond control + number of keycards if he has|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|jwit: Wow!  going to make now|pg||
nt|andyv:  now question of 7|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Trelde's asking bids devised by the late John Trelde|pg||
nt|sharynr: impressive|pg||
nt|andyv:  auction would seem to lead to A@c lead as the most obvious|pg||
nt|andyv:  but might have been afraid of void in E hand|pg||
nt|jwit: Even more so looking a stiff trump.  Increases the possibility of partner having a trump trick|pg||
