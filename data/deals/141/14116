mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: I really don't like West's bidding. First raising to only 2@H and then passing 4@S but overruling partner to take it out into 5@H.|pg||

mb|p|nt|woozle: Luo bids only 2S...his honours are junky, but he does have ten points and four trumps...they could miss the good game here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Chen passes, and there's an opportunity for Australia to take ten imps if they can bid and make 4S in the other room|pg||

nt|woozle: But if Chen overcalls 1S, he can catch a cue raise, bid game, and wonder what the problem is|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|patricck: New Zealand need a strong finish here to have a chance in this match|pg||

mb|1H|nt|rnmalik: W too weak to bid it.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|shinge: 4H or 4S? - getting dark here !!|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|patricck: It isn't going to be hard to find the @H switch|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|patricck: And passing 3@S on the North cards would have been a fairly scary option|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|tejjyid: me 2, help partner lead, says i|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|woozle: Luo is probably just looking for 5-3 spades, so the cold 5D contract might be overlooked for a poor 3NT|pg||

nt|mrdct:  a trump lead might make this challenging|pg||
pc|hA|nt|woozle: Travis might be able to achieve something here if she can duck the spade king smoothly and luo doesn't play the queen|pg||

nt|patricck: A chance for NZ to more than halve the deficit, bidding 6@S is certainly a possibility|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|patricck: THe 2@C is a regular game force, so that is fairly aggressive. North can bid 2@S to show a 5+ suit with 8+ points so I'm not quite sure why they would just bid 2@D|pg||
