nt|cuttysark: Current standings, at the half-way point after the 1st Round Robin are: England 102; England 2 81; Northern Ireland 78; Scotland 72; Ireland 68; Wales 46|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Ew play Acol with a weak NT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Results available on www.sbuwest.co.uk/SeniorCamrosehtml|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|idc: The format here is 6 teams (including England 2, the sponsor's team)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 20/20 hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|idc: They play each other twice over the weekend, two 14 board matches v each other team|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|lestergold: some might have ventured in with north if system allows|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i think that's a range probe|pg||
mb|2N|nt|idc: Scotland are the holders of the Senior Camrose - I'll try to mention that a lot before tomorrow, since I doubt it will be true afterwards :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: obviously Peter doesnt mind the 2 doubletons for his NT opener|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: think I will just as soon defend |pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Patrick Jourdain is a Camrose veteran: he has won the Camrose playing for Scotland when he was here for a brief spell, but usually represents Wales|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Gareth Jones also plays Camrose for Wales, usually with son dafydd|pg||
nt|fabsayc: any actual residence requirement?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Indeed - a 2 year residence requirement, during which time you cannot play for any other country|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: n/s do well in a diamond contract|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzjc: 2H denies a major|pg||

nt|jtr: So what do we know?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|jtr: Another potential 3NT|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|jtr: West did well to move  Of course he knows partner has @cs|pg||

nt|sybarra: and a bunch of extra tricks |pg||
nt|idc: Guess it needs a @h lead and @d switch, not a defence that is possible to find|pg||
nt|lestergold: someone keeps dealing 20/20 hands|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah thanks christine, i was an operator a few weeks ago, not easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but full credit to a thoughtful lead|pg||
nt|idc: They are fine as long as there is some shape to the hands|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|cuttysark: Not clear that the diamonds were 5-3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so just confirming, the last hand was 2 down?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: -2|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|sybarra: these are only "mildly" shapey |pg||
nt|sybarra: will W sit?|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w do no0t want to get too high here in spades|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And 6 imps to N ireland who stayed in 3@D|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@C is multi landy, showing both majors|pg||
nt|yo_yo: (not sure if that promises 5/4 )|pg||
mb|3C|nt|idc: Everyone and their dog is playing weak major/minor 2M openings these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: South opened a Multi in the other room, so North is playing 2@H|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Heart lead in the other room did not trouble declarer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what is the explanation of this auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: N in the other room did well to hold to -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: -2|pg||
nt|idc: West hand is worth something between 2.25 and 2.51 @s according to my made-up-odds system|pg||
nt|lestergold: shoud be able m to scramble 9 tricks on cross ruff ines|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: opposite a protective dbl it isn't quite as good|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|cuttysark: I suspect this double by the passed hand showed a major and a minor, or some such thing|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: south says he should have atleast 4 diamonds|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cuttysark: it does look rather odd to choose the 4-2 fit rather than the 5-3 :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok, this convention perhaps should remain nameless|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: there are hazards but declarer should get out for the loss of 2 hearts and 2 spades|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Agree that 3@S is a bit optimistic|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: 15-17 NT when vulnerable|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|idc: West was thinking of c!K to retain a @c entry to dummy for diamond ruffs|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|yo_yo: both the Welsh ladies represented Wales a few weeks ago in the Lady Milne|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d6|pc|c5|nt|cuttysark: The 'someone has blundered' defence to 1NT - it is becoming more popular|pg||
nt|fabsayc: meanwhile defense has had many opportunites to lead trumps|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yo_yo: good to see the ladies playing |pg||
nt|yo_yo: not for the english teams though :9|pg||

pc|h5|nt|lestergold: hm... drWING TRUMPS DOES NOT SEEM TO BE BEST HERE|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or irish|pg||
pc|cT|nt|cuttysark: England 2 playing in diamonds in both rooms - not usually a successful ploy|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|lestergold: if you hear pard clubs you can bid dims showing your hand|pg||

nt|lestergold: 4@H strikes me as an appropriate shot with south's hand knowing that any club honours with north likey  to be well placed|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sybarra: this feels like it should make|pg||
nt|idc: NS CC just says raises are preemptive after dbl|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this is ok too|pg||
nt|rodal f: But wich black hook after 1@H?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Decalrer has to guess which black suit to finesse - rather like an earlier hand he got wrong. |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Rather him than me|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he first has to play his queen|pg||

nt|yo_yo: Jean wasnt tempted to finesse in @D |pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: *not=now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: A 4@d splinter from West might excite East|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: with this top heavy hand i would prefer to show the nspqades on the way if anything than splinter|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rodal f: Weak 1NT at N in OR|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that one exceeds my fear level|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: CC says 3@c is Baron - some kind of balanced game raise - my guess is the CC is out of date|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lark20: with clubs sitting right, this is a good contract|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: well hardly balance|pg||
nt|idc: As a few specs have mentioned to me, 1@s is a better shot with the West hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: well if Baron, may alert them to the problem |pg||
pc|h6|nt|cuttysark: Wow - it is OK to open  weak NT with an 11 count, but I don't like to do ite with 4-3-3-3, particularly if partner is going to move with that South hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did they have weak 1NT openings in 42?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, was keystone of acol|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Oh yes - and even earlier|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Since North's hearts are not great he may well have an ace on the side|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But he will not have both aces, so it looks right to clear spades and sit back|pg||
pc|s2|nt|idc: Looks more like a delayed game raise with a @s suit, than shortage in @d being the key feature|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: imagine sitting in a musty hall at cambridge during the second world war|pg||
nt|sybarra: or blackwood will  |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If South decides to use Stayman - and why not, the chances of a 4-4 majors fit are quite good - she d=should bid 2@H over 2@D and hope to survive in a 4-3 fit|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|lestergold: roland has got into the bidding here for him an ecellent slam|pg||
nt|idc: Ah, was looking at wronf part of CC: 3@c is Baron over 1@s opening but after 1@h it is FG raise & artificial|pg||
nt|sybarra: so much for caution |pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|nt|cuttysark: North has no strong play|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||

nt|cuttysark: So sorry - don't go yet, still time for Wales to make a few more inroads|pg||
nt|idc: With a chunky 5-card suit and a couple of tens, I'd stretch to a game invite over 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|idc: Well, I guess the overcall makes that less attractive|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a near certain singleton but you can afford to duck|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not so sure about that duck however|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Should be a fair save against the vulnerable game|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am wondering why North did not make a penalty double on the first round|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Perhaps he thought the hand too strong|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could have been entirely shut out if west had rebid 3s instead of 3d|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|s7|pc|hA|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rodal f: It's might OK to wait E was not limited and NS at vul. |pg||
nt|cuttysark: It is suggested that Ns may play a convention known as 'Lionel' wher dbl shows 4+spades and another suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I guess penalty doubles of the weak NT are not very frequent - but I would be reluctant to give them up!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lionel was never designed for use over weak no trump|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is not so much penalizing as distinguishing strong versus competitive bids over the weak nt|pg||
nt|cuttysark: N Ieland allowed to play 4@S doubled on the previous board, so back in the lead|pg||

pc|dT|nt|cuttysark: That's how it's done :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well he will find out the good news in @D in a minute |pg||
nt|yo_yo: and the @C finesse works|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @H  are 3-3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that adds up to a make|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s7|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: lets see if W bids it  |pg||
nt|sybarra: yes he did |pg||
nt|idc: With SOuth having neither Ace for an entry, even @h lead is no good|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: this one maybe too tough to find 3nt|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: might do it with forcing stayman|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c5|nt|idc: On the previous board, 2@h by E was doubled in OR, but only -1 so a flat board|pg||
nt|idc: Now I think on it, this attack on declarer's communications may be best|pg||
nt|idc: declarer has to decide how to time playing @s & @d|pg||
nt|idc: play one suit too much and perhaps defenders can continue it to set up tricks|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|rodal f: Agree. Still 3NT is better:)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|idc: on another layout: here one round of spades, then @d towards K, then back to @s will work|pg||
pc|c6|nt|idc: or even 2 rounds of spades with them 4-4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzjc: "i dont know where i found that lead from" says Simpson :)|pg||
nt|idc: @h switch declarer would have to duck, then hope for spades 4-4 when defence went back to them|pg||
nt|idc: and d!A onside: needs a lot this game|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy for sure |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It's going well - |pg||
pc|sT|nt|cuttysark: Pips look good enough for 4@S also, though I agree there is no defence to 3NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S2 at S and 6 or 9 at N. Pitch @Ds from N at @H? Should still be on, but...|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yo_yo: greer's looking for the 13th I bet|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Steen Moller points out that if North had discarded 3 diamonds he would have given declarer even greater problems|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no he wasnt|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe - but he will settle for 12, i am sure|pg||
pc|h8|nt|fabsayc: this line i dont like|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you may as well cross ruff playing for spade 9 with south|pg||
nt|sybarra: is making 2 nt legit also? |pg||
nt|yo_yo: as long as he doesnt finesse the @H, he's home|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|nt|cuttysark: can establish clubs with a ruffing finesse, but a crossruff looks simpler|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
mc|12|nt|cuttysark: Still, Patrick was never one for the simple line|pg||

nt|sybarra: well taaaaaaaaadaaaaaaaaaaaa as they say |pg||
nt|idc: I can hear the drum roll from here :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: kibitzers are assuring me he had the count |pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|sybarra: sorry Ian  while we are suppose to be neurtral  sort of cheering for you guys |pg||
nt|idc: another close game that needs guesses - 4@h|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yo_yo: and yes, of course he did|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Last board of the day. We should thank all the organisers, and kath Nelson who has been a great commentator all day.|pg||
mb|d!|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Also the Vugraph operators - wonderful job|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: Hobby in Norway by 4 friends. When @D7 is done u go for @C7 - @S6 etc.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: thanks Liz and everyone|pg||
nt|cuttysark: We are back at 10am tomorrow for the denouement|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|idc: That's sweet.   I used to use the St Lucia flag rather than Scottish one but BBO told me to 'fess up|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: 5 4 in hearts  spades|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Last board of this match - a 12 imp lead means 18-12 to Northern Ireland.|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Scotland coming bottom in last European Teams caused me to change flag, to much pity from other commentators!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Players have a short break now - restart at 15.40|pg||
nt|idc: Time to thank people who have made this broadcast possible|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Liz  @H |pg||
nt|idc: Operator Christine Walker, BGB representative Sandra Claridge, SBU West District who are running the event, and the sponsor, Bernard Teltscher.|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: My fellow commentators Shirley & Mike|pg||
mb|p|pc|s5|nt|sybarra: we always love this event on bbo vugraph |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Time to thank everybody - the organisers, BGB and the West District of the SBU, our wonderful commentators and you, the spectators|pg||
nt|idc: And of course to BBO, without whom I'd be typing to myself.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|sybarra: and thx specs for great comments and humour|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: gosh the slam went down in the other room|pg||
pc|h6|nt|idc: seconded|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yo_yo: well done moyna|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|sybarra: the specs are the best!     we enjoy the comments and insights |pg||
nt|idc: A good game this but declarer will need to guess trumps (with the @dK wrong)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Current rankings can be found on sbuwest.co.uk/SeniorCamrose.html|pg||
nt|idc: Rae got trumps right at other table; big decision this|pg||
nt|cuttysark: That would be www.sbuwest.co.uk/SeniorCamrose.html|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice Liz,  that is easier for most of dummies |pg||
nt|sybarra: like me |pg||
nt|idc: Rae had a clue from @d lead that dK was wrong but I don't see that matters much|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Bit of a comic defence in the other room: Victor Silverstone lead @S7 and it was ducked to the eight|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East presumably thought it was second highest. Maybe better to lead the ten from this sort of holding|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c5|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ( i am slightly biased here, the mackenzies were our team mates recently in Killarney)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|idc: Just a guess in a sense, but restricted choice means K(JT) is twice as likely as JT in North|pg||
nt|sybarra: need the @D finesse now |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|idc: though you can pick up KJxx in South, so close decision what to do|pg||
nt|sybarra: far from an easy hand |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yo_yo: We would have done better if I hadnt revoked at trick 1 (as declarer)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Happens to us all, Kath - more often than we would like :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: now home |pg||
nt|idc: much easier if you don't have @h9, then KJ9x in South is no good for you, so % play is to duck|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: endplay alert|pg||
nt|idc: so NI win - well done to them|pg||
nt|sybarra: the card gods give you those spots for the challenge!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: Thank you play resumes 15.40|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Christine,  @H  and all |pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: bye for now|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yo_yo: i bet it doesnt happen to you liz!|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d9|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cuttysark: Don't bet :)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|cuttysark: So 2 flat boards to finish, and 24-6 to England 2.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: thanks all, that concludes this evenings play|pg||
nt|rodal f: By all and enjoy tomorrow. Was nice.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Thank you everybody - play starts tomorrow at 11 am local time.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: play resumes at 11:00 tomorrow morning, GMT|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The 24 imp lead gives N ireland 21-9|pg||
