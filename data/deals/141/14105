nt|ahollan1: 1@D=ART, 9-13 HCP, 4+@H, maybe longer @C/@D/@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome to Al Hollander|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: another set with the "fun" systems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expect a LOT of alerts for NS system   Forcing 1@C, Transfer Openers [aka submarine]|pg||
mb|2C|an| |nt|henryb:  I would expect the auction to start P-P-1@s-some bid showing @h& a minor |pg||
nt|henryb:  wrond again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=NF, ART, 8-11 HCP, 3@H  [maybe min, 4@H]|pg||
nt|sybarra: al,  are e/w playing precision? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Shi-Hou are playing Precision -- i was just typing that Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: for those watching,  this will be a lot of artificial bidding,  |pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: both pairs at other table also playing Precision variant|pg||
nt|sybarra: only used with experienced partnerships and 400 pages of system notes|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: ok maybe only 385 pages|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards -- and some supplementary notes - online under http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Open.aspx|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5H|nt|sybarra: might N sit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is he bidding  1 nt |pg||
mb|5S|nt|sybarra: must say I am not a fan of sitting at imps|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb:  clearly 1N was forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid's 2@D bid doesn't seem to fit the explanation I gave -- but i got if from their notes |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|janm: EW will probably end in 4@s on this one, and should make it unless NS get 2 club ruffs - I guess 5@c is actually better, let's see if West will show his club support to get there|pg||
nt|janm: This auction might get them to 3NT, which would not be a success|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Open Room starts play with board  29 -- so they will see results from us|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure who do bet on here,  defense if @H start I think|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|janm: Perhaps if W bid 3@c here, E might retreat to 5@c, but West decided his suit was good enough to play in, and with the @h A lead, he'll be right, I think|pg||

nt|ahollan1: missed opportunity, but any plus may be good on that board|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=11-15 HCP, a) 5+@H  b) 4441@D |pg||

nt|sybarra: yes seems so |pg||

mb|d|nt|ahollan1: interesting choices for Shi over 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N, trap pass, 3@C [@H raise], 2@D all seem to have merit|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe tryingn to get the @D suit in before the ht raise |pg||
mb|2D|nt|frankaus: green V red usually a go signal :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes thought he might come in  but suit is a bit tacky |pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is we are in game force sequence here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and protecting against opener having the 4441@D hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Hou pulled out the 4 @s card then changed his mind|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|frankaus: i expect this will fail|pg||
nt|janm: Looks as if NS can make about 3 hearts (maybe 4) and EW can make about 3 clubs.|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have an easy partscore in clubs|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: needs the spade lead,   should be -1 |pg||
nt|janm: Let's see if EW can get the spade ruff to beat this. If W leads a high club, E can overtake to lead a spade back|pg||
nt|janm: But on the trump lead I think NS are going to make 4 hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D is a mystery|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  I recently saw a study suggesting that with 4-3-3-3 opposite 4-4-3-2  you should not try for the 4-4 major suit fit|pg||
pc|c4|nt|frankaus: has a chance but its really tough|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|sybarra: would have to magically read the club suit I think |pg||
nt|janm: So we've had two hands in a row where the best defence would be to take ruffs.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if i would have been any better off with 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: well it both sounds like they have an ace the DO NOT have |pg||
nt|barnets: i think south should x and north bid 3@C|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|sybarra: (imho)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|frankaus: now @C was req|pg||
nt|pelu: I see the point - but how do u know that ps has 4-4-3-2 :)?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am however convinced that it is losing bridge in general to bid game with two balanced hands and 24 HCP|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: Reid checks to see if 2 tricks is enough to beat 6@H|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: might he be concerned spade is cashing?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: @H lead is bad idea now however |pg||
pc|d5|pc|c9|nt|sybarra: Reid might have also been checking backs of cards to see if they match |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: N and E starting taking the bidding cards away before Reid had a chance to X|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told neither NS player is known for being pessimisstic -- @SA not cashing would be way beyond that description|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|janm: Of course S doesn't know for certain that the spade A is onside |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|s6|pc|d9|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||

nt|bigtrain: to a point a agree... but he still has 3@S, giving the partnership 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but YOU know there is a 10 card @S fit|pg||
nt|ritong: because if he holds something like @s AKxx@hxx@d AKxxxx@c x, he would think " hey, i just need @s xxxxx and over to have a decent 4@s|pg||

nt|sybarra: but alas a push|pg||
nt|janm: It will be interesting to see whether the other room manages to get the ruffs to beat either of these first two contracts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NZ Juniors also in 12@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 1@H-(2@C)-3@C|pg||
nt|barnets: trick here is to stay out of slam|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w have every point in the deck except @CAK|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I confess I'd also open 2@s with the S hand - everything is right - vulnerability, position, spades being the highest suit|pg||
mb|2N|nt|janm: Of course now that 2@s has been alerted, it probably showed 5 spades and a 4 or 5 card minor, so wasn't even wrong on suit length, but I think it would be right to open it even if ...|pg||
nt|janm: it was just a weak 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same 1@H explanation as last board|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: a heavy 2N|pg||
nt|barnets: with 22 hcp and good 5 card suit|pg||
nt|barnets: n./s would be s well to bid 7N as 6 |pg||
nt|barnets: 13  tricks without club lead|pg||
mb|4N|nt|sybarra: ok now can e/w find and make slam? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: notes say Newell has 6@S --- i believe the notes|pg||
nt|sybarra: or can they really make 6 @D without help?|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: east is marginal for a 4N raise|pg||
mb|6D|nt|sybarra: 2 @C looks like "single suited"  |pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is W can tell which suit |pg||
nt|frankaus: sys on  here is normal these days with X replacing 21C|pg||
nt|janm: N probably has a good idea that his partner's second suit is clubs and so won't be useful, but it's certainly possible to envision game anyway.|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT on @dQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: yes and systems on= transfer in this case |pg||
nt|ahollan1: interference will slow down EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||

nt|rv: Hi Barnet and all specs|pg||
nt|barnets: hi|pg||
mb|6N|nt|ahollan1: hard to believe both red suits behaving favorably -- and will probably misguess both Qs anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: olmost certainly its @H now that S trans to @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: and wrong colors to be stepping in with 3 @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry with 3 @C I meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I don't know what options he had to invite over the DBL (surely 3@s was not invitational). I think S is going to come to 10 tricks, and he'd probably have accepted most ...|pg||
nt|janm: invitations, with maximum values and good spots in both suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: looks to be a playable spot |pg||
nt|friggi: sure it does|pg||

nt|cascade: 3@c will be invitational with hearts|pg||
nt|janm: Presumably 3@c shows some sort of heart raise|pg||
nt|cascade: and Miller finds himself with a surprisingly good hand for all of the bidding so far|pg||
nt|janm: Everyone has different approaches to Unusual, but as far as I know everyone plays that the cue bids show partner's suit and the 4th suit (although some of us use one and some the ...|pg||
nt|janm: other for those meanings)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, STR, F1, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: yes there are various ways|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure about 4@C|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, especially with partner bidding 2NT vulnerable, Miller must wonder if his side has a game|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c tied to hearts and 3@d tied to spades|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: and it is precision  (just not sure which variety) |pg||
nt|frankaus: communications wont be easy |pg||
nt|cascade: personally i play the lower cue agrees partner's suit and the higher is the other suit|pg||

nt|henryb:  that assumes you open 1N with all balanced 15-17|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT here is 6-10, so Why bid 2NT?|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is the only lead to beat 6N|pg||
nt|pelu: No they play 11-14 NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell has extra King for his 1st seat 1@C -- but can't imagine anything other than 3N now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N is discouraging, but since Reid unlimited it is not pure signoff|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: nice of @D's to break |pg||
nt|barnets: but never bid|pg||
nt|barnets: only -200|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cascade: Jan tells me she plays the cues the exact opposite way to me|pg||
nt|cascade: the most important thing is that you have an agreement with your partner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 3c for hearts, 3d for spades is the most common|pg||
nt|janm: This time we have a game where the declaring side will need ruffs (diamonds) to make it, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S asks controls   A=2 K=1|pg||
nt|rv: North could have chanced 3@c with enough distribution though suit is not good at these colors|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c6|nt|cascade: and the defense have ruffs to beat it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N=3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so the hand with void gets to declare?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: contemplating 5@C opposite @SK and @HA?|pg||
nt|barnets: he also may have tried 3@C over 2@S|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|janm: Although if he takes the club finesse he's been offered (right you are that the club bid got them off to the wrong lead), he can pitch the diamond losers and then just needs to ...|pg||
nt|janm: avoid a spade ruff (or S needs to figure things out and give his partner one, which may be hard)|pg||
nt|janm: So that will be a third hand that could have been defeated by a defensive ruff |pg||
pc|cT|nt|frankaus: a not so obvious @D lead/switch can couse lots of communications problems|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead gets a bit messy |pg||
nt|rv: West opening is post-modern, I like his raise to 2@s with 3 card fit instead of 2@d|pg||
pc|c4|nt|friggi: no problem. play for @D 3-3 |pg||
nt|pelu: so 2Nt would be 16-17 (18)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting -- could only do that because of @H10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: glad i'm not at the table -- as declarer i'd go into long tank because of too many possible lines|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|henryb:  because I think you need 3N to show a very different hand: say Ax, xxx, AKQxxxx, Q|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a) @S ruff  b) @SQ @CAK float @DQ c) @SK then ...|pg||
pc|c5|pc|sK|pg||
nt|janm: Declarer going after those diamond ruffs - but that will probably make it easier for S to realize he needs his partner to have a spade ruff coming, won't it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but as he did not discard a diamond i dont see how defense can go wrong|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|sQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|janm: I think S has to play A and a spade here, doesn't he? |pg||
nt|cascade: he doesnt have many options|pg||
nt|cascade: he would have been better to not overruff but he didnt know that his @hK was always a winner|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: even heart heart beats it|pg||
nt|janm: I don't know, it might be tempting to assume that West was doing the right thing and so it's necessary to play trumps to stop the second diamond ruff|pg||
nt|cascade: that works too|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh maybe not south will be endplayed|pg||
nt|janm: I think he can make after heart & a heart, can't he - lead a spade to the K, which either gets him to dummy or endplays S|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: as long as club ace still in dummy|pg||
nt|janm: If N leads a club now, declarer has to ruff, not win the A, which may not be clear|pg||
nt|rv: With West hand, I prefer to rebid 2@d and subsequently bid 2@s or 3@s with extras (14+)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|d4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|cascade: a heart gets him home|pg||
nt|pelu: u also need 2NT to show 16-17|pg||
pc|sT|nt|friggi: wrong line|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d9|nt|frankaus: trouble brewing|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he had to overtake|pg||
nt|cascade: if he guesses the spade|pg||
nt|janm: No, maybe that won't work - on a clulb at this point, he can ruff, but then has to cross to the heart J and won't have a way back to his hand. But on this return, he can ruff the ...|pg||
nt|janm: low club to pull trump - oops, |pg||

mb|p|nt|friggi: @C lead not enough|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you ever super accept with weaker nts?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont play them, so just asking |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was just going to say that Newell COULD have bid 3@H as SSGT super-accept  [short suit game try]|pg||
nt|sybarra: for an older person such as me,  I would have to do too much "re-thnking" of system |pg||

pc|sJ|nt|janm: Can't tell from the auction, can we? 1@c was alerted, as was 1@d. I'd have said we still didn't know from the alert to 1@c, but probably now it was a strong club and negative ...|pg||
nt|janm: diamond - still not certain|pg||

nt|henryb:  West now emerges with 3N?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i started old -- thinking systems has helped me regress|pg||
nt|sybarra: One Kib suggested bidding  3@H over 2@H (4 crd support, xx in @H)|pg||
nt|barnets: so n/s miss a decent game patly as a rsult|pg||
nt|rv: South chose to pass 2@c and subsequently 2@h since he suspected misfit|pg||

nt|friggi: then|pg||
nt|janm: I'm told that 2@c showed either diamonds or the Majors|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|rv: if South doubles 2@C and subsequently bids 2@S it is likely to be forcing, passing 2@c and bidding 2@s should be NF|pg||

mb|2C|an| |nt|sybarra: bidding it more of a challenge now |pg||
nt|friggi: not good bid at all|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, STR, F1, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@C takes them out of relay mode -- i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I think Namyats should be a better hand than that|pg||
nt|pelu: CC: just a solid suit - but I agree with u|pg||
nt|pelu: and not "solid" :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  My rules (back when I played it) was no 3-loser suit, and not two suits with two fast losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe DBL is relay -- i'm just not sure :(|pg||
nt|rv: at any other colors, West will gleefully doube 2@d, he is likely to bid 3n at these colors|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|an| |nt|sybarra: is this a slam that is biddable?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is very possible that 3@H=exact shape|pg||

nt|sybarra: or maybe only at home LOL|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|friggi: helps W to count that hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe "we" are on our way |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so YES Shirley|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: 3@s presumably Smolen, showing a game force with 4 spades and 5 hearts, so that partner can play the hand in hearts; they know they don't have an 8 card fit in spades already|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what to lead|pg||
nt|janm: 3NT is going to be very difficult to make here|pg||
nt|rv: E-W playing negative doubles and forcing pass till 2n after double by West to set up forcing auction|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cascade: what do you lead from Miller's hand knowing that declarer is probably 4=3 in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 Key Cards + @HQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: but when I bid these,  hts are always 4/1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lucky -- mine 5-0|pg||
nt|ahollan1: AND @S king offside|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: LOL |pg||
nt|barnets: can south be stopped from scoring a second club trick ?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: i might lead spades as the least destructive|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rv: I like this treatment as well, prefer positive doubles if we have bid a 4+ card suit naturally and on a similar forcing auction|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rv: East-West should time such defenses very well, need to combine punching declarer and remove his trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: if e/w tap dec he will make 4 @D tricks and a club|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: pity the trumps dont break (just a joke) |pg||
nt|sybarra: yep k off,  I will let you play the 5/0 breaks, and count my blessings|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|janm: Hard to know what to lead, I agree; although leading a 5 card suit is often right, when it's a bad suit and dummy has 4 of them... So I think he's probably right to try to find ...|pg||
nt|janm: partner's suit, just unlucky that he chose the wrong minor|pg||
nt|barnets: if they dont tap he makes 3@D tricks and 2 clubs|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: this seems to need 3-2 trump and nothing awful in @S|pg||
pc|h4|nt|henryb:  He can make this, I think. @h to Q, @d|pg||

pc|hK|nt|gambit: cl already 6 or 7|pg||

pc|dK|nt|sybarra: hold breath now for spade |pg||
nt|ahollan1: NZ has won imps on every board so far -- this another likely swing|pg||
nt|sybarra: (that is spades breaking favorably) |pg||

nt|sybarra: China seems to be pushing very hard at other table |pg||
pc|dA|pc|s9|pc|d8|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but defense does not have enough tricks then|pg||
nt|janm: Declarer has 2 spades, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds (if he uses the club and heart aces for diamond finesses), 1 club, he really can't find 2 more tricks, can he?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: ehaa......for the S bid |pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  2-8 HCP  --  i should copy/paste instead of trying to use recall|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be their system others call it Every, Hand An Adventure (EHAA)|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: not sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: battle of spades and hts, |pg||
nt|barnets: 3N and 4@S both make here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: and 4 @H's always "transfers" to 4 @S (for opps) |pg||
nt|cascade: i just checked double dummy and GIB thinks Miller needed to find the @c8 to defeat 3NT|pg||
nt|janm: Defense might get endplayed out of one trick, but 2? Hard to tell. And of course it isn't easy to lead the club Q either, just easier than leading low|pg||
nt|janm: But GIB lets declarer play double dummy too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EHAA was never this creative|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: 2@s seems a gross under-bid here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|friggi: should do|pg||
nt|friggi: ??|pg||
nt|sybarra: well indeed that is true!|pg||
nt|rv: it is normally played as Invitational strength 8-9/10 hcp even with 4@s|pg||
pc|cA|nt|janm: Ah, here we see science in action (not!)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well if 2s is minimum is quite reasonable|pg||
nt|sybarra: I only played it in midnight swisses|pg||
nt|barnets: you put the hex on australia|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cascade: 2@s will be minimum|pg||
nt|janm: They got to the right spot of course, but does N really know that his partner can't have enough for 7? Make the diamond Q the club Q for instance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might gain by not helping defense to lead|pg||
nt|cascade: i am pretty sure they dont play 2/1 FG|pg||
nt|fabsayc: remember is precision|pg||
pc|c9|nt|fabsayc: so 2s is definitely limited|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|rv: with 5@s and super-max for passed hand, I would have started with 2@h with West hand|pg||
nt|rv: lol|pg||
nt|barnets: as they miss a good game especially on th e bidding|pg||
pc|d6|nt|janm: Even if 2/1 isn't FG, couldn't he at least bid 2@c and then blackwood and tell his partner they had all the keycards and adequate trumps - S would know that AQx of clubs was golden|pg||

nt|pelu: 4@D or 4@s by West?|pg||
nt|rv: I intend to drive to game in any case and in my opinion 2@h gives more flexibility|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: hmmm will other room get to game after West open's strong 1@C?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|janm: I suppose there could be QJ in front of the K and A over it, but I don't think bidding scientifically will make it any easier for them to find that|pg||
nt|cascade: they have another chance to showcase their slam bidding|pg||
nt|pelu: see NSs problem after 4@s|pg||
nt|henryb:  somewhat difficult to get to 6@h-- maybe less difficult when West chooses not to open a large number of spades|pg||

mb|p|nt|janm: This time S has a positive response to 1@c|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@H=ART, 9-13 HCP, 4+@S, 0-3@H, maybe longer @C/@D|pg||

pc|cA|nt|janm: Or is 6@c okay too?|pg||
nt|cascade: do they need to|pg||
nt|henryb:  North MUST bid here; pass is not acceptable with that good a hand and heart support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=ART, 5+@D|pg||

nt|sybarra: may not be best spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell had option to bid 3@C showing MAX with longer @C|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|rv: South's action is surely too timid though it is hardly clearcut to bid at 5 level|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 6@D likely down if diamonds 4-1|pg||

pc|h5|nt|janm: I assume all of this was natural after 1@c and 1@d, and 3@s is some sort of attempt to find NT|pg||
nt|janm: 6NT won't be a success|pg||
nt|henryb:  Would North's pass be forcing? I do not think so. And North could have much less, say AKJxxx in clubs and out|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: oh is this blackwood|pg||
pc|hA|nt|janm: Surely if N jumps to 6@c, S should let him play there |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would have bid 4@C over 3nt|pg||
nt|janm: I think 4NT is just a quantitative slam try, not Blackwood|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club queen has to be a big card|pg||
nt|cascade: south did well to move with no aces|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, but S seems to be thinking along NT lines, also if he bid 4@c wouldn't that make it sound as if 3@s was a cue bid?|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|barnets: well done|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: i liked the unscientific auction better|pg||
nt|janm: Of course, N has a minimum and a void in partner's suit, so even with that nice 6-card suit and 3 aces, it's not unreasonable for him to pass|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cascade: Stout does have spade stoppers but the @sAK and the rest of his hand are also suitable for slam|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Grant-Ker did get to 4@H on previous hand|pg||

mc|9|nt|cascade: well they get to a similar situation after 1@c 1@h; 2@d 3@d ...|pg||
nt|janm: So making 5 or 6 depending on whether they cash the heart A now|pg||
nt|henryb:  in which case South might go down at the five level when the opponents were down in 4@s|pg||

nt|janm: The reason I think the strong club might hurt on this hand is more psychological than real - N starts out thinking he has a minimum and doesn't revise that idea|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the vague 3s and 4nt did them in|pg||
nt|janm: Another void opposite partner's long Major!|pg||

mb|p|nt|friggi: yes|pg||

nt|vugraphzkt: thank you|pg||
mb|p|nt|fifee: @S lead is a killer|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/Openxtab.html  for standings after 12 of the 13 rounds in RR1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: did it mean specially wk @D's?|pg||
nt|sybarra: *specifically |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 25 starts with Precision 2@C on previous board -- it gets scary from there|pg||
pc|h2|nt|barnets: how does this tourney work ?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|alchilds: no low =2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|janm: He knows he probably has the best hand at the table, but that doesn't necessarily translate into the ability to take 8 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not 2@D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Amanda, Henry, Peter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes @D preempt|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|janm: Well, he pushed them one higher, so I guess he was right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe double|pg||
nt|barnets: do the top 8 play off or top 4?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|janm: But DBL should surely suggest some club length, shouldn't it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2d suggests better diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double allows for 1nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D/@H are Transfer Preempts -- only 3@C is nat pre|pg||
nt|babs59: Paul Gosney has also qualified for the Australian Under 26 team - which meant that for NZ PABF he has been replaced in the team|pg||
pc|s3|nt|janm: True, but I'm afraid the doubleton club would keep me from doubling - I think I'd end up being a chicken and passing - maybe bid 1NT?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: on 25  China in 4@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: glaned at conv. cards, and were more than I could deal with at this time of night |pg||
nt|sybarra: *glanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've been studying newell-reid system for a while in preparation of this PABF|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|babs59: but he will be representing Australia in the World Youth Series in Philadelphia in October|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pelu: EW play Low as come on (and even)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Roland!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: welcome Al |pg||
nt|barnets: i am told its a double round robin|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|janm: However, pushing the opponents up a level was certainly a good thing, because it looks as if 2@s will be very difficult to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: partner will only bid clubs with 5, then the support is adequate|pg||
nt|barnets: tks |pg||
nt|barnets: nick|pg||
nt|babs59: I understand that this year it's a double RR and then the leading team wins|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|janm: Your partner, maybe :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 232 VP - 223 - 218|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: get a new partner jan :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if i had say 2524 i would rebid 2c|pg||
nt|janm: Once upon a time, I doubled 1@d with 4441 (in that order). My partner waited until the 4 level to bid his 4 card club suit!! Taught me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so i think here double suggests some diamond length|pg||
nt|janm: I would be more likely to DBL with 2524, and certainly with 1534, but I think you're convincing me to bid 1NT|pg||

nt|friggi: not the best line:)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|fifee: great defense though|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|henryb:  You cant take enough ruffs, so might as well play the @hQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  Indonesia currently 2nd, Chinese Taipei first|pg||
nt|babs59: however in other years this is the Zonal selection event for the Bermuda Bowl (and Venice Cup / Seniors) - in which case there are SF and Finals|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|nt|fifee: down 2 now|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|janm: Best now is for N to lead a club and get his ruff |pg||
nt|cascade: but a diamond works too|pg||
nt|cascade: since declarer also needs to ruff a club|pg||
nt|janm: Interesting that a diamond will have the same good effect as the club ruff|pg||
pc|c8|nt|babs59: the Pacific Asia Bridge Federation is Zone 6|pg||
pc|h5|nt|barnets: i like semi finals and finals|pg||
nt|babs59: however the Zone 7 countries are also members - Australia, New Zealand, French Polynesia, New Caledonia|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: this is 1st match of Round Robin  2    Open is playing 2 full round robins, 13 teams so 1 sitout each|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not exactly sure what they did with the other events where not enough entries, so RR1 combined Seniors/Ladies   and  U26/U21 for better movement|pg||
nt|sybarra: j of @C and stuffs W in |pg||
nt|ahollan1: turnout and maybe team strength affected because this is NOT a year where PABF qualifies country for World Championships|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 2010 event in Philadelphia is an open event -- i.e. not country-specific|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s9|nt|babs59: so in the Zonal selection years, though many of the Zone 7 countries play, the Semi Finalists are drawn from the top 4 teams, discounting ALL matches v. Zone 7 countries|pg||
pc|d5|nt|janm: I was wondering whether N would decide a ruff/sluff was best at this point, and whether it will gain a trick - I think E's spade spots are just a little too good for it to do so|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well,  was easy for us to see,  not so easy at the table|pg||

nt|babs59: they are Zone 6, RV :)|pg||
nt|barnets: tks babs|pg||
nt|babs59: that's why it's beneficial for Zone 7 to compete.  We are a small zone and very isolated|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i must admit i did not think of this bid|pg||
nt|cascade: not sure i like it|pg||
nt|babs59: Zone 6 is what I'd tend to call 'south-east Asia'|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: nice 4 @S for n/s here|pg||
nt|henryb:  hard for N-S to get to @c|pg||

nt|pelu: :)|pg||
mb|1N|an| |nt|friggi: should be easy to reach|pg||
nt|cascade: but NZers like to preempt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 3+@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: but didnt S have exact count on W hand  so @C play was auto?|pg||
nt|babs59: in politically correct terms - Pacific Asia Bridge Federation :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|pelu: here the 2-opening-style worked perfect|pg||
mb|d|an|take out|nt|sybarra: I dont play 3/2 well with no high cards LOL|pg||
nt|cascade: Stout is on the way to 4@s|pg||
nt|janm: 2@h is 5 hearts and a 4+ minor, I guess - I confess I wouldn't have made this one |pg||
nt|janm: Hopefully 3@d showed both diamonds and a minimum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N would have been 13-15 unless partnership doesn't allow 5422|pg||
nt|babs59: in 2011 the PABF will be held in Macau|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: 5-4-2-2 equal minimum - you have to have some standards|pg||
nt|henryb:  although 2@s would certainly work out just fine as a contract|pg||
nt|pelu: @c-lead - normal here - dont work - there are 5 @S-tricks|pg||
mb|2D|nt|cascade: that is what is commonly played|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c/@d = minimums|pg||
nt|janm: Now is 3@s forcing?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not to me|pg||
nt|cascade: and 3@h/@s = maximums with @c/@d respectively|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but then i dont open this crap|pg||
nt|cascade: lets hope not and they have discussed it|pg||
nt|janm: So Miller has shown a minimum, will he decide it's good enough to raise if 3@s isn't forcing?|pg||
nt|cascade: he does have an ace and a fit|pg||
nt|babs59: I have a suspicion that both Zone 6 and Zone 7 will use it for selection purposes for the World Championships|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: oops operator |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkt: sorry a bit sleepy after lunch :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Probably N could have bid 3@s over 2@h to invite in spades, so maybe this should be forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: I know I do not play their system since that is not a neg X for m |pg||
nt|sybarra: for mi|pg||
nt|rv: Double of 2@c by West is t/o and need not have extras|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: need some coffee or tea |pg||
nt|janm: The 2@h bid did keep EW from getting to too many hearts :)|pg||
nt|cascade: there are lots of ways to bid spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Shirley -- you mean Hou's DBL?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I would not X with that hand |pg||
pc|h2|nt|rv: many experts play this treatment below 2M level after 1M-1N-(2X by opps)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: (or a beer) |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: negative dbl with 4+@H -- what's wrong with that?|pg||
nt|rv: double above 2M level on 1M-1N-(2/3X by opps) is still t/o with extras (15+)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cascade: Lau was undeterred by the hearts sitting over him|pg||
nt|janm: Now, can he make this? Or rather, will he? I'm sure he can double dummy|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h8|nt|janm: Or maybe he can't if E puts the diamond K up on a lead towards dummy |pg||
nt|cascade: i think he has to lose at least one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: first off, it is only a 7 count,  pard never knows I have 5 hts.  and never knows to bid them |pg||
nt|rv: North should have surely competed to 3@c|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|friggi: do you agree?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can handle any minor suit rebid from partner too|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h6|nt|janm: Of course N doesn't know he has spade losers, so is just trying to lose a trick in each side suit and ruff the second club loser|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|cascade: Chan can Grosvenor now with the @s7|pg||

nt|sybarra: agree with that |pg||

pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|c5|pc|s8|pg||
nt|janm: Those of us who wouldn't have opened 2@h with the S hand can now explain that it would have prevented our side from going down in 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I will say,  I do not strongly object to the neg X,  with single spade,  and the minor holdings   (just dont like the point count )|pg||
nt|ahollan1: get shape across -- let partner worry about points :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i arrived late -- if it wasn't mentioned  2@H=Weak both majors 6-11|pg||
nt|ritong: with no precision about lengthes?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess 3@S described 5@S 4@H |pg||
nt|ritong: rather sporty if so|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bigtrain: they should set trump over 3@S...  4@C = @H & 4@D = @S|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ritong: the contract is a tad sporty as well, but will roll home with everything friendly|pg||

nt|fabsayc: i missed that magic|pg||
nt|janm: I don't think that really made|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: it did|pg||
nt|janm: How?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: to say Newell-Reid have had a good set is quite an underbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: possible if defense never lead trumps|pg||
mb|2D|an| 2 - 7 pts, 6cM|nt|alchilds: yes|pg||
nt|friggi: 2@S pass out|pg||
nt|cascade: the play showed declarer leading trumps|pg||
nt|pelu: in Board 8: taipei in 7@h - and lost @DQ - West had also open only 1@S - with a 4@S-opening more easy to find @DQ - but diff to bid 7 :)|pg||
nt|rv: traditionally Chinese Taipei and Indonesia were top teams in Zone 6, now it is very competitive with China, Japan etc making rapid strides in world bridge|pg||
mb|d|nt|friggi: risky|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|ahollan1: 1@D=ART, 9-13 HCP, 4+@H, maybe longer @C/@D/@S|pg||
nt|rv: China is arguably the strongest team in whole of Asia (Zone 4-BFAME, 6-Far East) now|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|an| |nt|janm: Well, apparently he somehow made it and now we get to see the Precision 2@c in action|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=F1 , 4+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=a) 5@H(332)  b) 4441@S c) 2452 d) 1453|pg||
nt|barnets: multi 21D|pg||
nt|rv: some play lebensohl from North hand on 2@h by West|pg||
nt|barnets: south better not pass|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: and not wasted values here |pg||
nt|sybarra: well maybe the q of @D's|pg||
nt|friggi: right, freindly layout and lead as well|pg||
nt|cascade: a subdued Miller and Stout here should win back some IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Yes, surely he'll make at least 3 :)|pg||
nt|cascade: or rather too much aggression at the other table to wind up to 5@c|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we may play it here also |pg||
mb|3S|nt|barnets: now 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: friendly|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well forget that statement|pg||
mb|4N|nt|barnets: I like 4@H - 5@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  6@s looks like a much better contract|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@S|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: 3@H confirming 5@H along the way to showing max 1N|pg||
nt|rv: yes good auction|pg||
nt|rv: is Peng's 4N quant here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: hopefully no one leads trumps too soon |pg||
nt|janm: I think a 3@c rebid with the N hand was what pushed them too high - it just has too much in the short suits and too many quacks|pg||
nt|babs59: the other table started with North bidding 2@H - both majors, weak|pg||
mb|6S|nt|ahollan1: in college we defined  Down 1 = Good Bridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- i was enrolled in college   no - i didn't go to class as often as i went to bridge table|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL  |pg||
nt|sybarra: but we made it thru right?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after a mere 16 years|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i made LM in decent time|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: some of us "dashed" thru faster than that,  but my father who often was nice enough to pick my up from school always knew where to find me |pg||
nt|rv: I suspect not though it could be for many other partnerships since fit is not found|pg||
nt|barnets: ok well done|pg||
nt|rv: as Barnet suggested, Peng should bid 4@h to show good @s fit, mild slam try|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rv: and his direct 4n should possibly be quant?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|barnets: try and give a ruff|pg||
pc|cA|nt|barnets: looking at dummys diamonds|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|henryb:  @h by E-W should work out well, but you had better correct that|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pelu: hi Amando undo - 61H by N|pg||
nt|pelu: Amanda|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pelu: in OR West bid 3@d|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|barnets: only chance|pg||
nt|rv: as score stands with 1 deal to go, Aus winning match by 21-9|pg||
nt|rv: with only 5 VPs behind leaders Taipei before this round, this win could even more them to first place|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|pelu: Lead @DK to A and now @HA made the play easy|pg||
nt|henryb:  he may go down now|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: (student union bridge and euche room)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|henryb:  a lot, in fact|pg||
nt|pelu: need to finess in @s to make|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: *euchre |pg||

nt|rv: sry 22-8 as score stands now|pg||

nt|barnets: thats what is taking so long|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|pelu: wd|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|henryb:  since he won't play West for two singletons|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought euchre only midwest|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: and south|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am originially from midwest,  Nebraska |pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhhh|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c5|pc|d9|pg||
nt|rv: a possible line could be to play for @ds 42 and @s breaking?|pg||
nt|rv: any other better line?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|barnets: yes he could do|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|babs59: I'd have taken RV's line|pg||
nt|barnets: or a variance of what he is doing|pg||
nt|barnets: cash @SA|pg||
nt|barnets: now and @DQ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pelu: No no no - not @HJ - just play on @Ss to East ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: if not he may run into a trump promotion|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|h9|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|babs59: he's now committed to relying on @D 3-3 or long @D with long @S|pg||

nt|friggi: 3NT in N/S|pg||
nt|janm: What were you saying about 8 card suits yesterday, Wayne?|pg||
nt|cascade: well there have been plenty of 8s and 9s the first two days|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are occuring too often|pg||
nt|barnets: i think|pg||
nt|barnets: its close|pg||
nt|rv: Aus moving towards magic 25 VP mark, now leading 23-7 with wrong end of VP scale (1 more IMP to reach 24)|pg||
nt|barnets: after the wk two bid|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|janm: And what would you do with this one? Pass and hope to bid later? Open 1, or open a bunch?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: China on the board!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and our last bd of this set |pg||
nt|barnets: they like the multi|pg||
nt|barnets: so do I|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: thx to out wonderful operator,   great job as always |pg||
nt|alchilds: easy|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Friggi, and Al,  and Frank and Pat, who were here earlier |pg||
nt|friggi: thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thank you. back in  a bit oveer 30 minutes- lets hope I am more awake then :)|pg||
mb|3H|an|p/c|nt|sybarra: and of course great thx to our specs, for the helpful (and sometimes humorous comments |pg||
nt|janm: Lau chose the latter course (when I'm playing that 4 of a minor is natural, I love to be able to open it)|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  another ambitious 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remaining matches for the day are posted now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: next will be Open: Australia v China Macau   Senior: Indonesia v New Zealand (Cornell)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|janm: In the other room, East also opened 4@c but his partner judged to raise |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: ah, the hand that needs the heart shift|pg||
nt|cascade: an interesting point is that I think that dealing programs need to have published their algorithms to allay suspicion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing 2@C = weak @C + another|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  on 24HC with no particular source of tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: overtake and heart seems right|pg||
pc|dK|nt|friggi: my guess was 3@C 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: quick shot of something then for you....(what ever that is) |pg||
pc|dA|nt|alchilds: my too may go set|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, and maybe the spade 10 should suggest shifting to a heart?|pg||
nt|pelu: again the 1NT 6-12 created the problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid -- 1st DBL = PEN  2nd DBL = Takeout [i think]|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||
nt|janm: Guess not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think any spade but ace is really wrong|pg||
nt|janm: Of course, they're not going to beat 4 whatever they do|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|friggi: needs @H play from Dec, diff to find|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is will play @D up from hand |pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N was 13-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S shift is killer|pg||
nt|sybarra: can China make a profit here?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|henryb:  this one needs 3@c tricks, a reasonable shot, and either 4@h and 2@s or lots of spade tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: in normal system u would pass 2@S|pg||
nt|rv: this should make 9 tricks even with likley @s finesse|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pelu: best lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  My stomach is growling, so I will leave you. Have fun, and thanks, Peter|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|rv: we are playing last board of this match|pg||

pc|h7|nt|cascade: For those kibitzers who are interested in chess|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: absolutely -- i was thinking best defense 300|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|rv: my thanks to excellent Vu graph operator and wonderful co-commentators Barnet Shenkin and Barbara Travis|pg||
nt|babs59: and thank you RV and Barnet, for not jinxing Australia too much|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: no so maybe here a bit more excusable|pg||
nt|barnets: well tks all specs and fellow commentators I am retiring for the night |pg||
pc|c5|nt|cascade: Ker at the other table is a many time NZ Chess champion|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|rv: also a word of appreciation to Roland Wald who organises all these Vu graph broadcats and BBO management for telecasting it live|pg||
nt|rv: finally to all specs for listening to us patiently|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|cascade: about 8 or 9 times i have lost count|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: maybe 500 now|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|janm: Interesting how many people are good at both games|pg||
mc|9|nt|fabsayc: there is a dealing program written by a norwegian|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which produces a lot of wild hands|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks like that program|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is used by some of the dealing equipment|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so wherever the equipment goes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and i am totally convinced the hands are not random|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the technical term is pseudo random|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in a run of say a million hands it should converge on the theoretical odds |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: romm will stay open unti scores are finalised|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H10 would have been very trusting - an maybe worthy of write-up|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting position now however |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D best|pg||
nt|rv: this is last round for the day, please join us tomorrow for more exciting matches in RR2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: One more round today|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In 40 minutes|pg||
nt|rv: sorry 1 more round today in 40 mins, thanks all|pg||
nt|babs59: what treat is in store?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Chinese Taipei vs Japan  open |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can't remember the other one|pg||
nt|babs59: Under 26 Australia v Japan|pg||
nt|Walddk4: One from the U21 I think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh, thx|pg||
nt|babs59: and Open  Chinese Taipei v Japan|pg||
nt|babs59: U21 is what I WANT Roland :)|pg||
nt|babs59: specifically Australia U21 :)|pg||
nt|babs59: of course, I know that that will happen when I have to work!!|pg||
nt|rv: Aus win this match 25-5 if this score stands|pg||
nt|rv: bye all|pg||
