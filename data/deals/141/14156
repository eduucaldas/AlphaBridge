nt|yuval10: what to bid from S now?|pg||
nt|s bech: So.. We have started with what looks like a 4H or 4S by E/W|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: NS play a strong club system, counting zz points while EW combines with some other conventions|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Ida still?|pg||
nt|daman: looks like 3NT for EW to begin|pg||

nt|chick: both pairs are playing strong club systems here|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: As far as I know :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: if they don't have any specific methods then perhaps 2NT was the best choice|pg||
nt|s bech: looks like 3sp E/W and 2h N/S is last making|pg||

nt|pbundy: not 100% certain that 4@S will make, though|pg||
nt|chick: right peg, I think he just got in a hurry|pg||
nt|chick: so a very sad result for Westerlund, but may be duplicated in the other room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: imo quite normal 4@s |pg||
nt|daman: now a cool 6@D for NS  |pg||
nt|daman: 6@H is off on a @D ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Ida Grönkvist. Good morning to you too|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: Good morning everyone!|pg||
nt|nobbe: but defence now got a trick on J of @D instead|pg||
nt|chick: same reason I dislike bidding things like Michaels with 5-4 instead of 5-5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes hard to argue with that last but|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bit|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is perfectly normal and reasonable and just unlucky.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: exactly|pg||
nt|arvidsson: missed the tricks in the beginning |pg||
nt|arvidsson: 9 tricks, but the rest|pg||
nt|s bech: yes|pg||
nt|s bech: 10 tricks. This might be a swing for N/S. 4M with some missguessing will go down|pg||
nt|mcarroll: W Trying to find a distribution - including @DA with partned which might let them defeat this contract, but on this layout is just giving up extra overtricks|pg||
nt|ady: good result for n/s|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Well played, if East takes the @S Ace, South can fall back on  the @C-finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|mlodygda83: kolejny id¹cy szlem|pg||
nt|pbundy: are they playing big club in the other room, also?|pg||
nt|pbundy: some more standard players might choose 1NT with east's cards|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5@c also possible|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Preempt becomes meaningful if all the points available are in that suit.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mlodygda83: szlemik kierowy na EW, ale brak bilansu|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: kierowy ciut powy¿ej 50%, gdy¿ dochodzi drobna szansa pikowa|pg||

nt|chick: I don't mind 1N on 6322, but I prefer the 22 not be both majors|pg||
nt|chick: S had 4 losers opposite a 5-card weak 2 bid, should he really expect N to cover 3 of those losers?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: great hand for Ripstra:) (majors with clubs)|pg||
nt|affe82: i think 4@h is made most of the time with 2@h and a @c loser|pg||
nt|affe82: if you go for @s ruff in short hand|pg||

nt|vugraphpl4: ale cos wybral|pg||
nt|zbig1959: EW - 3@H, NS - 2@D ... :)|pg||
nt|peachy: i think it is easy to get to the nonmaking H slam|pg||
nt|daman: for all of the point counters   a nice slam on 22 HCP|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this weak opening is very popular. its goal is to drive the opponents to games they would not otherwise bid, and also give them enough information to make it when they would ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: normally go down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, since slam would be 75% facing  AQxxx   xxx  xxx  xx, i would say yes|pg||
nt|ziff:  Who would open if @D Q were the J?|pg||
nt|affe82: @d k and @s queen falls nicely|pg||
nt|s bech: a diamond ruff in defence still|pg||
nt|haans: quite start|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: declarer had to avoid losing @DAJ and @Cx so could not afford to lose finesse to @DJ|pg||
nt|chick: or give them a nice target to shoot doubles at|pg||
nt|marlowepi: either red game ok|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the subtitles are great|pg||
nt|turnip1: spade slam around the corner, but will not be reached i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|yakop: ali abi boþ durmaz cevabýný verir hemen|pg||
nt|atalok: sonrada rakip 7 nt der oda guzel|pg||
nt|tomek: wejscie moze pomoc w zagraniu szlemika, tak bylo w meczu finalowym|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: chocia¿ po wejciu S robi siê dobry|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: minimaks w rozdaniu wynosi 2000 za 7@s z kontr¹ -8, ale w¹tpiê ¿eby gdzie pad³ taki rezultat|pg||
nt|chick: W might think that partner's major is @Hs and take some preemptive action here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or keep them out of doomed game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is my favorite method in the world----for my opponents to play|pg||
nt|chick: if you need partner to have a very specific hand to make a slam, he doesn't have it|pg||
nt|chick: who would open if the @DQ were the @DQ?  :)|pg||
nt|s bech: 3nt ?|pg||
nt|chick: a strong jump shift, haven't seen one of those in a while :)|pg||
nt|turnip1: 3N...|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yakop: deðil mi varoþlu abi senin taleben ne de olsa|pg||

nt|xenya: any ideas what 2@D is?|pg||
nt|pbundy: diamonds :)|pg||
nt|xenya: funny :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: i am wondering what 2@H was.  if 2@D is something like long diamonds and 12-15 ... then what would 2@H inquire?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unless X by E pass fine|pg||
nt|chick: 3@Hs a good save|pg||
nt|chick: since 2@S will make easily|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't understand the result on board 24|pg||
nt|Walddk4: For a start they should not have played that board at all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Do you have an explanation, Ida?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So EW play a 2-way club, but not the transfer responses that are becoming ever more popular|pg||
nt|haans: :) morning Ida|pg||

nt|turnip1: I would not want to be there|pg||
mc|8|nt|awasiak: Dwururka to poprzedni wynalazek Pazura. W parze z Wójcickim gra systemem Nail.|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps 2@D can have multiple meanings|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 5D better single dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: NS play swedish standard with 4c openings. EW do also play very natural, though the opening 1@c contains all 16+ hands|pg||
nt|chick: when I play SJS, the guideline is ... "we are playing game in either your suit or mine", no searching for a fit|pg||
nt|chick: and very rarely NT|pg||
nt|s bech: 3H and still looking for right spot...|pg||
nt|s bech: something smells fishy here... |pg||
nt|affe82: north might sac though|pg||
nt|s bech: dangerous layout. 4 cl making E/W. 5diamonds making N/S. If not spades are lead all tricks for NS|pg||
nt|s bech: will Johan take a gambling 6d/6h ? He knows 13 tricks if clubs are led|pg||
nt|s bech: (or red suit)|pg||
nt|s bech: interesting lead problem from both defenders if Noth raises to slam now|pg||

nt|chick: nothing more than partscores available here|pg||
nt|haans: must be morning for Franzén 2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: either N or S was eligible to act. these weak 2s work mainly against opponents who have not fully discussed counter-measures or who are by natiure conservative|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean the weak 2-suited ones|pg||
nt|yuval10: this will be interesting|pg||
nt|ziff:  The rule of the rabbi says: If the King is singleton, play the Ace. Easier said than done, of course|pg||

nt|chick: I really dislike "weak 2" openings with 7 card suit ... 2@H and 3@H are very different kinds of hands, more than just one more trump :)|pg||

nt|chick: 4@S possible here|pg||
nt|po-s: Team Kamras is now 4VPs ahead of HansOve, and another 4 ahead of Gullvi. HansOve can only get 5 more as they  have 20-10 at the moment|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pbundy: despite good intermediates, just not enough strength IMHO|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1 IMP playing in attack|pg||

nt|cuttysark: West's rebid confirms the strong 1@C|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But East will still not be exceited|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the problem playing 2 way is that now the pas by West would means 11/13 bal|pg||

nt|fabsayc: if opener's are 6 up, passouts are impossible|pg||
nt|yuval10: if their system is to open from 6 and higher count, then it's probably safe to say they've never experienced any "all pass" in their partnership|pg||

nt|s bech: powerful hand north. 4 spades shoud make with an overtrick|pg||
nt|chick: easy 4@S, but EW have a good save in 5@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I also considered that, and neither N nor S had an obvious lead, but I can't imagine them actually bidding it|pg||
nt|pbundy: despite the distribution, 3@C would be my call here, too.  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: Polish 1C opening is usually something like this 12-14 HCP, balanced (usually without 4 diamonds) or 4=4=1=4; 15+ HCP with a real club suit;18+ HCP with any shape|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The main problem with the Swedish 1C opening is the lack of flexibility: the "strong" hand types have to take a second bid (or else risk not showing their strength), which does not ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: work well if those hands are not pure two-bid hands. |pg||
nt|chick: this could be bad if EW end in 3N |pg||

nt|sybarra: some days are like that!  (at least for me) |pg||
nt|friggi: that happens ..many times:)|pg||
nt|xenya: ah yes|pg||
nt|Walddk7: This is a fine slam|pg||
nt|cicus: sometimes you cannot tell just how much they are worth|pg||
nt|caitlin: I would think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: just 3@h was GF|pg||
nt|dimi: are you sure Lukas?|pg||
nt|dimi: +2?|pg||
nt|shevek: not impressed with the auction in the other room here|pg||
nt|dimi: NS made slam, great result should be down 2|pg||
nt|shevek: and we can't really blame east for not leading a @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: i am sure about the score, but not about the fact, how the declarer played in real, because it was too fast|pg||
nt|shevek: with the @cs 4-4 and the @d finesse on, 3NT won't be a problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: this is the 12 of 13 rounds|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|sfoxa:  and if 2@d was with @d - this king is of full value|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The 2@D bid did not promise @Ds, but is 8+ HCP, so it was not as clear as one might think that all suits were well protected |pg||
nt|shevek: ah ok, np then|pg||
nt|shevek: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/bgt_2010/10_05_14_wer.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: allrite, wife not around, office would be off in half an hour, so good time to polish a tiny bit b4 on th way home, toast guys:) mebbe she tolerates..lol..around 90 degrees here, ...|pg||

nt|h_karluk: @h serefe man, we love you David @h :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Roughly 75%. Can they bid it?|pg||
nt|caitlin: then why no 1@S bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: after 4@c cue, N should stop bidding slam...|pg||
nt|caitlin: if anyone in spec knows, let us know:)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rnmalik: Part of the game:)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Difficult without a fit|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|jtr: And we love Turkey|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzkk: well, no risk no fun in Team...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: Susanne Bohnsack, playing on N, is the only women in the A-Group (10 Teams)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|friggi: right|pg||
nt|sybarra: would you consider a super accept with W|pg||
nt|xenya: very hard, yes|pg||
nt|shevek: good dbl by west|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Was 1@s conventional?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  did he upgrade this 17 hcp to 18? or do they have other nt ranges?|pg||
nt|shevek: that says: not so keen for you to lead one pd |pg||
nt|shevek: undo pls|pg||
nt|shevek: Lukas?  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: the double means: I have a better idea than the @s lead...|pg||
nt|shevek: south bid 3@d in OR and made it easy |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: my wife's origin is Donegal, and personally i love Ireland :) all neighbors around property near the sweet pond are here also Irish origin@H|pg||
nt|jtr: It might get awkward otherwise|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, that what I meant :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|h_karluk: ahh could be conventional, kinda xfer with weakish values|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh really? We are close to Donegal|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's nice, all anchestors and relatives still there:) seriously|pg||
nt|jtr: 1@s denies a major probably|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is not good in short team match |pg||
nt|shevek: there goes 10 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: 3NT are no problem here|pg||
nt|shevek: the only problem was to bid it :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: all those spade pips work too|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk7: Right, you don't count hcp for @S1098, but they are worth gold|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: because he definitely wanted to play in @h suit|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jtr: oh ok|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzkk: will be 1@d and 1@s for E|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|juror2: 14-16 |pg||
nt|tomi2:  ok, thx|pg||
nt|friggi: yes for game - fast arrival prinsip|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tomi2:  this helped them to find this good game|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: i guess so|pg||
nt|shevek: now this contract has no play on ANY lead|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: tx lukas for alert|pg||
nt|dimi: true, this is down 2 with best play|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzkk: or W ;-)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sfoxa:  http://www.german-bridge-trophy.de/ - for results, but non-on-line|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: on in 3 @D so playing this to make |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jtr: I wonder how they show @ds|pg||
nt|cicus: this could even make one day but not today|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jtr: Maybe they dont bother|pg||
nt|drewsky: not me...4 trip 3 , only 15 HCP, and my free 2@S bis clarifies 3+ as well|pg||
pc|c7|pc|sQ|nt|dimi: can hold it to 1 down|pg||
nt|shevek: argument at the table Lukas?  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: south has claimed, but now he say he doesnt claimed|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, @ds don't run|pg||
nt|dimi: a kib said @h now, then it's 2 down i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: because east says, he wants one more...|pg||
nt|shevek: only one??|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: and now we have TD at table|pg||
nt|shevek: after claim declarer is not allowed to take any finesses|pg||
nt|dimi: NS hve enough tricks, it's only one down|pg||
nt|yuval10: one more seems reasonable, when S play K@d and see that W doesn't have any, he overtake in dummy and loses 1 for a claim|pg||
nt|dimi: yes|pg||
nt|shevek: guess he overtakes @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: and now we have -3|pg||
nt|shevek: true true|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's th question -- how to show @d|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2 more sounds quite weird|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|xenya: so perhaps there is a lesson here|pg||

nt|h_karluk: excellent analogy:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: he explained after the 3@c bid, so then it was clear with the @c's...|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 2H perhaps not a clearcut action|pg||
nt|turnip1: 6C|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think it's that tough... these guys are very good|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mr murray: also could have set up clubs in dummy. that takes nothing away from defenders who were real good|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Yuval, a perfect observation, but impossible to the table (need @d 3/3)|pg||
nt|haans: good 6@H|pg||

mb|2S|nt|tomek: trzeba bylo uciekac w 3ba, tansze:)|pg||

nt|s bech: 49-0 IMPs (24-6 VP) andHans-Ove is now in the lead overall. Kamras is 2:nd and Gullvi is 3:rd|pg||
nt|turnip1: 4S will make even with 4 rounds of diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: might end up in 3nt|pg||
nt|s bech: or a good 4 sp|pg||
nt|yuval10: or pass|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Bergen style raise by E|pg||
nt|nobbe: nasty trumph break|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyone prefer X to 1@H?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very dangerous to pass in N seat|pg||
nt|marlowepi: important to open 1D|pg||
nt|chick: trusting pard to have 4 spades, I think N can afford a 3@S bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for sure|pg||
nt|chick: the double should also show at least 3 diamonds (in theory)|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
mb|3C|nt|chick: This is most likely some form of Stenberg ... 3@C showing a club fragment and a non-minimum hand|pg||
nt|haans: easy to bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: close|pg||
nt|ziff:  Not exactly without risk to open that 12 count with a singleton @S in fouth hand, either|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, then no reason why not to bid with a double-fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: has to be 4 spades, no way S should be encouraging N to compete against hearts without 4 spades when both are PHs|pg||
nt|friggi: I do not think that he @D suit in N can justify an opening|pg||
nt|arvidsson: or 4 @H :)|pg||

nt|chick: ok, a minimum hand :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@d to give the limit raise with 3 cards without sgl/void in my opinion is usefull|pg||

nt|marlowepi: what it comes to in large part is, how high are u willing to back in with double?|pg||
nt|jcwla: With only enough values for one call, I do.|pg||

nt|chick: The OR is on their last board, and we are half done|pg||
pc|c7|nt|xenya: as expected, more imps to Varbergshus on 5|pg||
nt|affe82:  which, at least to me, makes the accomplishment of stopping in 3cl earlier with an A and a K in responders hand even more suprising.|pg||
nt|friggi: as I said before too much ash in the sky for the angels to fly around:)|pg||

nt|ady: take the finesse though north also made the 2@C overcall|pg||

nt|affe82: but no source tricks? just 7 winners now or?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: The results are a bit missleading since board 24 has been scored in some mystic way, giving Skalman 11 imp they havn't deserved (yet?)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be was more precise to play A in @C before @d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: when you can help your partner better to help|pg||
nt|haans: Must was invented by Einar Pyk one good name in Sweden|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer can play safely here and play A@h and @h|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think it is very likely 3H was assumed to be limit. when both nonvul opps have already passed, one of them in 3rd seat at favorable, i dont think it makes all that much sense to ...|pg||

nt|mcarroll: In fact he has to strip S of exit cards in @D and throw him in with trump |pg||
nt|arvidsson: still this will not make |pg||
nt|s bech: why not ruff a diamond after first heart?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: or might N be in trouble after 2 @H?|pg||

nt|vugraphzkk: there are also online scores|pg||
nt|yuval10: it's a matter of imp anyway - -17 instead of -16|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: A wild one too|pg||

nt|vugraphzkk: yes|pg||

nt|dimi: last board for this set|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that is easy to find |pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: they missed chances in board 4 and 5|pg||
nt|cicus: this board is not going to alter the result|pg||
nt|cicus: N has a 3@H bid in my opinion|pg||
nt|cicus: and S will carry on to game|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: well, i think board 14 will bring some IMPs for Israel|pg||
nt|cicus: N has to filler cards|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: and this is easy |pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: 2@h is more often 5 than 6 cards...|pg||
nt|yuval10: both should've been a pickup for Winklboy team and turned into minus|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  seems they also use transfers after 1@C-x|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|cicus: two*|pg||
nt|shevek: not as easy as the previous board, true|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|caitlin: obviously 2N here is hearts and minor|pg||
nt|cicus: S is overbidding now|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|cicus: as 3@H was not forcing, he should have settled for game|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: 2NT = @h+@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkk: but sometimes it doesnt work :(|pg||
nt|caitlin: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: in this board the computer says that 3NT are makeable|pg||

nt|sybarra: last bd of this set,  thx again Lukas. Great job!|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmmm|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: they even didnt find 3NT, so no decision problem for S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|tomi2:  that 4333 8 count with no king and ace and no heart stopper wouldnt be my favorite hand for 1nt facing a partner who could be "light on classic shape"|pg||

nt|vugraphzkk: seems, that Hungary will win this fight...|pg||

nt|yuval10: well, earlier this week we saw the French women's team playing in a splinter twice in as many sessions|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But 2@D is clearer under the bid: the 1@H response is often xxxx and you may want to bid hearts naturally|pg||
nt|rnmalik: appears so.|pg||
nt|yuval10: S in the OR found the only lead that make 13 tricks for declarer possible|pg||
nt|yuval10: negative free bids works here|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@s from N now?|pg||
nt|chick: so back to a very close match|pg||
mb|2D|nt|daman: now 4@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard to say. W is not close to max and E has mediocre hand|pg||
nt|chick: 1@D has several possible meanings, 10-16.  one of those meanings is 4+ @D and 4+ other|pg||
nt|caitlin: that is one advantage of S bidding 1NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like N has a natural @c lead now|pg||
nt|arvidsson: hard to know in the bidding who of opponents have the K of clubs, so one would know who should be declarer|pg||
nt|chick: 3@S apparently preemptive, but N goes anyway|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i am astonished that declarer went down in 4H|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite reasonable to play S for 2-2 @h IMO|pg||
nt|yuval10: S for singel @h rather|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure why the rush to play @s.... Martin's line would have given a 2nd chance with no risk|pg||
nt|haans: do not like that 2@S|pg||

nt|mrdct: well judged by east|pg||
nt|chick: it may be that 2@S shows a minimum hand, too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: K of D??|pg||
nt|yuval10: now likely to matter that much here, seem like 11 tricks in 3NT |pg||
nt|marlowepi: sort of works|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: a bit wet by both sides?|pg||
nt|chick: so I predict 2@H+2 and time to make some tea :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that might be an overbod...couldnt W have 6HCP?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N had passed in 3rd seat at favorable and had already shown up with a ton of HCP. it had to be S with the @HQ|pg||
nt|chick: yes, this is the usual restricted choice situation when I am playing :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3NT or 4@H?|pg||

pc|h5|nt|atalok: 3nt degil bence|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: lekko krzywe otwarcie w tym rozdaniu nie przynios³o sukcesu|pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: ale juz od¿yli i analizuj¹ rozdanie :)|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: a tymczasem Auguri w 6 zagra³o 6|pg||
nt|xenya: in particular, i don't quite understand W's 2@H|pg||
nt|turnip1: important change of trump|pg||
nt|po-s: after all -I have a diamond control...|pg||
nt|turnip1: putting P under pressure?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: switch ten and 7 of spades and i think there would be a guard squeeze for 6N without a spade lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: yep and persumably N would've opened with 12 points and 4 @s's|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes that was my point. probably any 12 points but for sure with 4S which were known about|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 7@D is 4 off|pg||
nt|friggi: yes|pg||
nt|s bech: unlucky for E/W that N gets a chance to lead club if they reach, But that might not be the only lead she´s thinking about.|pg||
nt|arvidsson: onless a club lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2uj293f  running scores|pg||
nt|arvidsson: on a club lead it is 5 |pg||
nt|friggi: so he will play for 2-2|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|tez: al @d asý @d as yap..al @h ruayý @c as yap..@s ve @d empaslarý gecsin..7 olur:)|pg||

nt|tez: @h asý @d as yapacaktýk..yapamadýk:)|pg||
nt|tez: hayal kurmak bedava:)|pg||
nt|tomek: 3-cia dama kier pod nozem daje szanse na wygranie|pg||
nt|peachy: difficult to follow a completely artificial auction|pg||
nt|yuval10: the players here played all day long and fatigue probably takes its toll|pg||
nt|affe82: could be as expensive as 800|pg||
nt|chick: that would be enough :)|pg||
nt|affe82: looks like a good decision by NS|pg||
nt|chick: and the @CQJ is revealed, so no mistakes there|pg||
nt|chick: a nice system that worked well on this hand|pg||
nt|s bech: will declarer play clubs for ruff at this point? ending up with 5 sp 2 cl 2 he and one ruff |pg||
nt|turnip1: hans-ove in the lead!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yakop: h asý tref as yap o oluyo ben gecenlerde yapmýþtým:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jeli wierzyæ operatorowi w meczu M-M zagrano kontrakt 7 BA z reki S i po pierwszym wicie pikowym rozgrywajacy zaimpasowa³ waletam??????????|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: ja bym siê tym kontraktem nie chwali³, ale poszed³|pg||
nt|snetram: szczêscie po stronie Auguri|pg||
nt|garden2005: a w poprzednim rozdaniu bez dwóch figur kierowych: @s Axx @h Dxx @d AK10 @c Axxx kto by³by winien ?|pg||
nt|pbundy: certainly very conservative|pg||
nt|mrdct: good system hand for EW|pg||
pc|c6|nt|atalok: guney cl kesmiyor zannediyor lar bence|pg||
nt|tez: @h asý @c lerin arasýna koymuþum..@c as zannettim ortak mý dedin:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe there is one still with spade jack lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: OR has already finished while we have 5 more boards to go|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ah no, cant get to E hand to lead heart to ten without burning an entry|pg||
nt|chick: unfortunately those pretty diamond honors don't give useful pitches|pg||
nt|s bech: after cl A west should lead hearts|pg||
nt|turnip1: 149-148-145-143-141,5...|pg||
nt|ady: on hand 16 Skalman gained another 12 imps  when they played a hopeless 3NT in OR   a fortunate but playable 4@H made here|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|atalok: muhtemel artý 1 olacak|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: w rozdaniu 7|pg||
nt|zbig1959: akcja z typu Bols'a idee - Zia X pantery,, x na id¹cy kontrakt, aby odeszli na nieid¹cy |pg||
nt|aldek: w 4-tym, 5-tym i 7-mym byly niewiarygodne motywy w rozgrywce|pg||
nt|awasiak: 1BA standardowo na m³odszych, dalej wszystko naturalne.|pg||
nt|zbig1959: po blokach karta ronie, impas @H podniosl reke W.. (6 rozd)|pg||
nt|friggi: that is too much..hand up|pg||
nt|s bech: Team Yellow now 49 IMPs |pg||
nt|s bech: unexpected when we left in half-time|pg||
nt|arvidsson: this will be a good chance for Kamras, EW will probbebly bid 6 spades|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: czyli znowu odskoczyli, a jeszcze 10 dojdzie|pg||
nt|daman: hopefully they don't get to slam off 2 @ces|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: They're now officially fighting against the clock - 5 boards ought to be played in 25 mins|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once he starts this will not takle long|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'd not hold my breath if they won't make it on time|pg||
nt|chick: and with the bad spade lie, -1 for sure now|pg||
pc|h8|nt|daman: Aces*|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes that has to be the explanation|pg||
nt|friggi: @C lead is also pretty obv in 7@D|pg||
pc|d7|nt|awasiak: Po wejciu dwukolorowym Jeleniewskiego rozgrywaj¹cy ma szansê trafiæ @sD.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right. it might even be right to pass 2S, but can have sympathy for W biddign a second time|pg||
nt|s bech: if decl can throw away hearts on diamonds, and play all his clubs East will be endplayd on spades|pg||
pc|h2|nt|tez: @c leri alýrlarsa tam olacak|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer seem in no need to hurry mood|pg||
nt|ziff:  N/S did very well here to stay out of 3NT despite 25 HCP|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am worn out just from commentating, so i can imagine how tired the players are:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: those are 4 days in a row of many boards per day|pg||
pc|c3|nt|po-s: If 1D really showed diamonds perhaps 2D could be a 2-suiter but in today´s bridge nobody has diamonds just because they bid them - if so 2D ought to show diamonds|pg||
nt|friggi: no values in @S is the main problem for W|pg||
nt|friggi: so @H PASS big time|pg||
nt|friggi: 3@H|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|nobbe: with diamonds 3-3 we have 10 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|rmb1: If the defence don't continue diamonds (revealing the break) declarer can take club finesse|pg||
nt|nobbe: after the first 5 boards scored in the second half, Kamras have increased their lead by 7 more imps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes there is a sense in which W opened 4H here|pg||
nt|arvidsson: Maybe south should x 5 @c?|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|arvidsson: WELL I AM NOT CERTAIN|pg||
nt|arvidsson: sorry caps lock|pg||
nt|friggi: after all this ..yes|pg||
nt|affe82: is finessing in clubs and play for @h discard an alternative?|pg||
nt|s bech: chanses of 11 if diamond A with north or that you can ruff 2 clubs without overruff|pg||
nt|affe82: the @d suite also offers some interesting options|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ady: this can go down now     needed to play low on the diamondlead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  CanÂ´t misguess @D|pg||
pc|s4|nt|s bech: good defended by east. More diamonds or clubs decl would have made 10 tricks|pg||
nt|s bech: by west*|pg||
nt|friggi: in USD yes, but maybe not in SE krones:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: W has shown 8-10 and 4324|pg||
pc|s5|nt|s bech: yes, slam it is and the pressure is now on North for the only setting lead.  Does she have enough inforation?|pg||
nt|turnip1: another IMP to Skalman|pg||
pc|s8|nt|yuval10: i don't think he should X|pg||
nt|yuval10: he doesn't want a @c lead from a bare J for instance|pg||
nt|arvidsson: one cant be sure club is the right lead, could be @D one wants|pg||
nt|yuval10: and if P has JT @c he should hope that she'll find the lead herself|pg||
nt|friggi: if that would be tha case Emma would lead @C J is that a bad lead?|pg||
nt|andyv:  play of hand far less exciting than the bidding|pg||
nt|haans: but far less rewarding|pg||
nt|mcarroll: In a contest as close as this every imp counts|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If they lead 4th highest, S knows that W has no card higher than the 8 - the good old rule of 11|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Maybe he is thinking what to switch|pg||
nt|turnip1: yes, but he can think as much as he likes, no matter 2 tricks to NS|pg||

pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: przepraszam za komentarz - zmêczenie|pg||
nt|cuttysark: In which case you would have to double, or bid 2NT to show the 'unbid'suits|pg||
nt|s bech: should West bid 1 spade ? how about XX if run? ofcourse a visit to the bank if P bids clubs|pg||
nt|ady: though still should make   can guess right later|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|xenya: and if the bid does show what W has, E is certainly worth another move|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mlodygda83: dobre pytanie|pg||
nt|arvidsson: a diamond lead and a good result for EW|pg||
nt|friggi: yes|pg||
nt|friggi: good question|pg||
nt|chick: @Ds seem useful on the surface, but entries a problem|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|dA|nt|snetram: jestem przeciwnikiem otwierania 1BA ze zbyt dobrymi 17PC|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: ale to jednak 4333, fakt, ¿e w kontrolach|pg||
nt|affe82:  i don't know about you but with 6 scattered opints red vs red imps i would not put pressure on partner and just invite game with 17+ on other hand. i'd take the plunge. i do go down a lot though. |pg||
pc|d2|nt|atalok: kotunun iyisi|pg||
nt|po-s: 2NT - in the nebulous diamond case - might show the minors|pg||
pc|d8|nt|friggi: @C lead not so good:)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: but should be a push |pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|s bech: diamond lead. lost oppertunity for a slam swing. |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|tomek: wist treflowy kladl automatycznie ten kontrakt|pg||
nt|arvidsson: Upmark Cullin will bid it as E in the other room |pg||

nt|aldek: tymczasem Buras wypuscil 4@D|pg||
nt|zbig1959: jak zaimpasuje @cJ to wygra 4@D|pg||
nt|affe82:  especially knowing that opps need to catch up and are likely to push.|pg||
nt|yuval10: now declarer has 11|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h4|nt|mlodygda83: B-N graj¹ 14-16 wiêc w ogóle nie bêd¹ mieli tego typu problemów w tym rozdaniu|pg||
nt|affe82: line of play would be very interesting at MP|pg||
pc|dT|nt|boomelant: bedzie przymus wyjasniajacy|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So all in all the 1@S overcall in thsi room has a lot to commend it :)|pg||

pc|sT|nt|chick: non-vul, it's just annoyance to EW, but vul, I think it is a huge gamble, and this time we will see ... 500 a save vs 3N making, but not clear that 3N will make|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|s bech: so spades will be played from the East hand|pg||
