mb|1C!|nt|Walddk2: This is a very good slam actually but will fail because of the bad trump break|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S!|an|8+ bal|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I am talking about 6@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C has a better chance|pg||
mb|1N!|an|asks|mb|p|nt|mamos: wow 4@H seems a little underbid though as cards lie .............|pg||
mb|2C!|an|13+|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But that will likely also fail|pg||
nt|iceking: this looks like NS are playing strong club |pg||
nt|xenya: yes they are|pg||
mb|2D!|an|asks|nt|iceking: so 1sp could be control respond or shows some bal hand |pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|an|no 4M or 5m|mb|p|nt|iceking: just guessing |pg||
mb|3C|an|asks|mb|p|mb|3S!|an|2344|mb|p|nt|xenya: 6@C certainly has a chance i think -- at least double dummy|pg||
nt|iceking: on trump lead looks impossible to make everything breaks so badly but maybe you can double dummy |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think you can double dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7 clubs tricks, 4 spades and 1 heart|pg||
nt|iceking: win in hand spades 2 times ruff diamond cash 2 spades heart ace cross ruff 12 tricks|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: might play that way iff w had enter the bidding with crash or something to show the red suits |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Still, you are unlucky to go down in 6@H|pg||

nt|iceking: if heart 3 is udca this shouldnt be any problems |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is|pg||
nt|mamos: may be trying to work out which @h is best|pg||

nt|xenya: a kibitzer points out that E might return a spade on a low @H switch|pg||
nt|iceking: its the def only hope east can never guess this right if w returns heart king and another heart|pg||
nt|xenya: very likely -- so the @HK is best here -- unless E had 3 hearts originally |pg||
