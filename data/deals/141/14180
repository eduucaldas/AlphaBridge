nt|mrdct: EW can make 2@D or 2@S i think|pg||

nt|patricck: It actually turns out to be the right action, but that is not the point|pg||
nt|vugraphzks: director being called|pg||

mb|p|nt|littlejuzz: Neither pair has played on vugraph before, a daunting experience |pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|patricck: With the @D lead looking like a singleton declarer should have played to the K@S and led a @H up, that way the A@H is played on nothing and declarer can afford to ruff the 2nd @D ...|pg||
nt|patricck: high|pg||
nt|patricck: The fact that 5@H went off will save the Director some work, North/South are no longer feeling disadvantaged|pg||
nt|ish: They must be very nervous|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: hi Alan -- so can I [i've studied their system AND yours]|pg||
mb|4H|nt|patricck: So a good, but quiet start there for Singapore, it would be easy to envisage North being persuaded to get overboard there|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: It seems that the diamond suit of KQJ1098 is in fashion. Exactly the same suit that North held on board 1|pg||
nt|ish: This match could decide 2nd place|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ish: NZ need a decent win to catch Australia who are currently in 2nd place|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzks: 9 tricks may be hard to find here|pg||
nt|patricck: I wonder how many trumps West needed to find a double?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h2|nt|patricck: should be 2 down, when South wins the A@C they can lead the K@H through for a ruff|pg||

nt|alanz: back now, sorry had connection problems with BBO|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Alan -- do you know how Peter's response is affected by Karwur's preempt?|pg||
nt|vugraphzks: Tsang thinking of something intelligent to do |pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: If East shows a big @S@D two suiter it should be possible for South to guess the play to bring home 5@C|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|patricck: This is the reason why a lot of pairs play transfer responses to 1@C these days....1@C-1@H(spdes)-1@S(3 card support)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|patricck: Bidding it may be a more difficult matter of course|pg||
mb|4S|nt|patricck: To make 5@C declarer has to lead the K@C, see the 10@C drop and then run the J@C. After cashing one top @H with the Q@H dropping fom east low towards the 10@H will keep the @H ...|pg||
nt|patricck: losers to 1 trick|pg||
nt|patricck: North's 3@C bid should be enough to persuade South to bid 5@C|pg||
mb|5C|nt|alanz: Not sure, but if 1@s is positive, then 3@d DBL= penalty suggestion showing @ds|pg||
mb|d|nt|patricck: Well.... not needed when the opps balance for you|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|alanz: in other words, a natural double showing @ds|pg||

pc|dT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the plus side -- the auction has really helped declarer read the distribution|pg||
nt|alanz: yes it is not easy to see ....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe Karwur should have bid 3@S instead of 3@D?  no -- he would want to go higher if Sacul had @H & @S|pg||
pc|dK|nt|patricck: I guess he can still ruff with the K@C and lead the J@C, but I bet that doesn't happen|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Matter of opinion on Brd 21, some players dont preempt a P who is not a passed hand.|pg||
nt|itinerant: So the Australian U26 team which has been leading for most (all?) of the tournament by a healthy margin finds themselves needing a draw in this match to retain the top spot|pg||
nt|patricck: I'm sure that you will be supporting Australia ed, so I should balance it by barracking for Singapore, but I'm not sure I can bring myself to do that after that declarer play. ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|patricck: 3NT is probably a better contract than 4@S, though both should make|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: Yes and no. Our national Congress in Late September (great event for those who are thinking of coming :) ) is 52 boards a day for the first 3 days and then winds up to 70+ boards ...|pg||
nt|patricck: for Tuesday-Friday with only 2 sessions again on the finishing Saturday|pg||
nt|itinerant: Howard needs to find a club lead to shoot this legitimately|pg||

pc|s5|nt|psridhar: But W backed in with 3D !|pg||
