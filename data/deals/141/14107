nt|babs59: in the other room East's 1H was passed out|pg||
nt|babs59: here South is more actively involved in the bidding.  Many would not overcall 1st round with his hand - often feeling that a 6-card minor is more suitable|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|vugraphzkq: Hung Frowning|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|patricck: New Zealand need a strong finish here to have a chance in this match|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: W too weak to bid it.|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|shinge: 4H or 4S? - getting dark here !!|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: It looks here like NS might make 3S and EW might make 3H, and the law of total tricks is taking a day off|pg||
nt|woozle: Or, NS might make a really pushy 3NT|pg||
mb|p|pc|c8|nt|woozle: Wow. The currently anonymous South doesn't regard his AQT9xx of spades worth a second bid|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|woozle: given that 3S is an easy make opposite a minimum opening with a singleton trump, he might want to remain anonymous|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Hiroaki Miura from Japan|pg||
nt|hirmi: Hi|pg||
nt|woozle: North can switch to a spade and pitch a diamond on a spade winner, then a diamond ruff for one off|pg||
mc|8|nt|woozle: hi hiroaki|pg||
nt|woozle: I think the play went past in a blur there|pg||

nt|patricck: A chance for NZ to more than halve the deficit, bidding 6@S is certainly a possibility|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|patricck: THe 2@C is a regular game force, so that is fairly aggressive. North can bid 2@S to show a 5+ suit with 8+ points so I'm not quite sure why they would just bid 2@D|pg||
