nt|idc: @hQ I meant|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|idc: The format here is 6 teams (including England 2, the sponsor's team)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 20/20 hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: They play each other twice over the weekend, two 14 board matches v each other team|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: some might have ventured in with north if system allows|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|idc: Scotland are the holders of the Senior Camrose - I'll try to mention that a lot before tomorrow, since I doubt it will be true afterwards :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: think I will just as soon defend |pg||
pc|cA|nt|cuttysark: Patrick Jourdain is a Camrose veteran: he has won the Camrose playing for Scotland when he was here for a brief spell, but usually represents Wales|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Gareth Jones also plays Camrose for Wales, usually with son dafydd|pg||
nt|fabsayc: any actual residence requirement?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cuttysark: Indeed - a 2 year residence requirement, during which time you cannot play for any other country|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: good 5-card suit I beg you|pg||
nt|mamos: lol   almost Kath|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Irish Multi :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: rather 2@D than a 2-suiter with such anemic @D|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yo_yo: Greer Mackenzie is playing throughout this competition, with 2 partners|pg||
nt|Gerben42: hopefully only 1 system though|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@H would show a 2-suiter with Moyna|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Moyna?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Most people have trouble keeping one partner :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Moyna is Greer's wife|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: moyna , his wife, is his other partner|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||

nt|sybarra: and a bunch of extra tricks |pg||
nt|idc: Guess it needs a @h lead and @d switch, not a defence that is possible to find|pg||
nt|lestergold: someone keeps dealing 20/20 hands|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|fabsayc: but full credit to a thoughtful lead|pg||
nt|idc: They are fine as long as there is some shape to the hands|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|cuttysark: Not clear that the diamonds were 5-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: these are only "mildly" shapey |pg||
nt|sybarra: will W sit?|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w do no0t want to get too high here in spades|pg||
mb|3S|nt|idc: Everyone and their dog is playing weak major/minor 2M openings these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: South opened a Multi in the other room, so North is playing 2@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|cuttysark: Heart lead in the other room did not trouble declarer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what is the explanation of this auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: N in the other room did well to hold to -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: -2|pg||
nt|idc: West hand is worth something between 2.25 and 2.51 @s according to my made-up-odds system|pg||
nt|lestergold: shoud be able m to scramble 9 tricks on cross ruff ines|pg||
pc|hK|nt|idc: opposite a protective dbl it isn't quite as good|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I suspect this double by the passed hand showed a major and a minor, or some such thing|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: south says he should have atleast 4 diamonds|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cuttysark: it does look rather odd to choose the 4-2 fit rather than the 5-3 :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok, this convention perhaps should remain nameless|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: there are hazards but declarer should get out for the loss of 2 hearts and 2 spades|pg||

pc|c5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cuttysark: The 'someone has blundered' defence to 1NT - it is becoming more popular|pg||
nt|fabsayc: meanwhile defense has had many opportunites to lead trumps|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm... drWING TRUMPS DOES NOT SEEM TO BE BEST HERE|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry caps lock hit|pg||
nt|idc: It may work with South having @sQ9, but agree on a lot of other layouts|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c7|pc|d3|nt|cuttysark: England 2 playing in diamonds in both rooms - not usually a successful ploy|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||

nt|Gerben42: the game is a bit lucky but it works|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: I'm not sure it counts as bridge but it is fun :)|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|idc: South remembered his partner had passed initially, so no need for anything more than 1NT|pg||
nt|idc: Just 4-0 to NI after 4 boards: you get to decide if that is tight bridge or flathands|pg||
nt|idc: maybe a bit of both|pg||

pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: as opening lead|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Had to lead hearts to get a spade through, but no special reason why he should|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Heart lead might cost a tempo on other layouts - the 6card club suit is the killer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it might but the spade is huge favorite to blow a trick|pg||

nt|lark20: would have doubled on second round for T/O|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|cuttysark: Anyway, This is the last board of this session. Many thanks to Sandra Claridge of Bridge Great Britain, and Michele Alexander and Peter Cohen of the West district of the Scottish ...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Bridge Union for organising the event, and to Bernard Teltscher for sponsoring it. Also to our excellent operator, Stuart Bradnam, and to my fellow commentator, Martin Johnson . |pg||
pc|h5|nt|cuttysark: And of course Frank Rodal, whose name I cannot spell correctly :)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And, as they have just pointed out, there ar two more to play since they started with 17|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So sorry - don't go yet, still time for Wales to make a few more inroads|pg||
nt|idc: With a chunky 5-card suit and a couple of tens, I'd stretch to a game invite over 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|idc: Well, I guess the overcall makes that less attractive|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: a near certain singleton but you can afford to duck|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|fabsayc: not so sure about that duck however|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Should be a fair save against the vulnerable game|pg||
nt|idc: You'd expect North's spades to be lying over partner's honours there|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|cuttysark: I am wondering why North did not make a penalty double on the first round|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Perhaps he thought the hand too strong|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could have been entirely shut out if west had rebid 3s instead of 3d|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|d6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|rodal f: It's might OK to wait E was not limited and NS at vul. |pg||
nt|cuttysark: It is suggested that Ns may play a convention known as 'Lionel' wher dbl shows 4+spades and another suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I guess penalty doubles of the weak NT are not very frequent - but I would be reluctant to give them up!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lionel was never designed for use over weak no trump|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is not so much penalizing as distinguishing strong versus competitive bids over the weak nt|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|Gerben42: ? 3NT is cold|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|yo_yo: i think East should bid 3 with that @C suit|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or even open the bidding|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if they play 11-14, why didnt east open it :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|Gerben42: as the hand stands, take 2nd @H, finesse @D and play @S|pg||
nt|lark20: they certainly play 11-14 in all positions|pg||
nt|yo_yo: isnt 11-14  normally 12-14 with the odd 11 count opened?|pg||
nt|lark20: normally but that is not what is on their card|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
nt|idc: On the previous board, 2@h by E was doubled in OR, but only -1 so a flat board|pg||
nt|idc: Now I think on it, this attack on declarer's communications may be best|pg||
nt|idc: declarer has to decide how to time playing @s & @d|pg||
nt|idc: play one suit too much and perhaps defenders can continue it to set up tricks|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|rodal f: Agree. Still 3NT is better:)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|idc: on another layout: here one round of spades, then @d towards K, then back to @s will work|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|idc: or even 2 rounds of spades with them 4-4|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzjc: "i dont know where i found that lead from" says Simpson :)|pg||
nt|idc: @h switch declarer would have to duck, then hope for spades 4-4 when defence went back to them|pg||
nt|idc: and d!A onside: needs a lot this game|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy for sure |pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Pips look good enough for 4@S also, though I agree there is no defence to 3NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S2 at S and 6 or 9 at N. Pitch @Ds from N at @H? Should still be on, but...|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||

pc|h9|nt|cuttysark: Bit of a comic defence in the other room: Victor Silverstone lead @S7 and it was ducked to the eight|pg||
