nt|henryb:  Hello All|pg||
nt|henryb:  back to 17|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this may be first ones to one nt |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=ART, 9-13 HCP, 4+@H, maybe longer @C/@D/@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome to Al Hollander|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: another set with the "fun" systems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expect a LOT of alerts for NS system   Forcing 1@C, Transfer Openers [aka submarine]|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello All|pg||
nt|henryb:  A partscore battle, with N-S aboe to make 4@c and E-W 2@s|pg||
mb|1S|nt|henryb:  I would expect the auction to start P-P-1@s-some bid showing @h& a minor |pg||
nt|henryb:  wrond again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=NF, ART, 8-11 HCP, 3@H  [maybe min, 4@H]|pg||
nt|sybarra: al,  are e/w playing precision? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Shi-Hou are playing Precision -- i was just typing that Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: for those watching,  this will be a lot of artificial bidding,  |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi everyone welcome|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: both pairs at other table also playing Precision variant|pg||
nt|sybarra: only used with experienced partnerships and 400 pages of system notes|pg||
nt|henryb:  The Australian pair clearly do not play strong club|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: ok maybe only 385 pages|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards -- and some supplementary notes - online under http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Open.aspx|pg||
mb|2N|mb|3S|nt|sybarra: might N sit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is he bidding  1 nt |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this seems rather high|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: must say I am not a fan of sitting at imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  clearly 1N was forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid's 2@D bid doesn't seem to fit the explanation I gave -- but i got if from their notes |pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|janm: EW will probably end in 4@s on this one, and should make it unless NS get 2 club ruffs - I guess 5@c is actually better, let's see if West will show his club support to get there|pg||
nt|janm: This auction might get them to 3NT, which would not be a success|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Open Room starts play with board  29 -- so they will see results from us|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure who do bet on here,  defense if @H start I think|pg||
pc|c5|nt|henryb:  the two-step probably shows constructive values|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mwigor: hi all|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like a save v 5@H|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: we can only peek at their [and any other vugraph table] using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|henryb:  We do not have an auction, but at the other table West over reached to 4@s and caught a vey bad dummy|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Hyper-agressive bidding by the NZ  north-south in the other room propelled the auction very high, very quick|pg||
pc|d6|nt|janm: Perhaps if W bid 3@c here, E might retreat to 5@c, but West decided his suit was good enough to play in, and with the @h A lead, he'll be right, I think|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this match is 1st China-Taipei vs 5th Japan|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: ..and in the end they got the outcome they wanted (opps made the last mistake!)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s3|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|barnets: @DK|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
pc|s5|nt|barnets: may have worked|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: likely 300 for NS -- i'd feel good bringing that score back to the table|pg||
nt|barnets: as if east had rufffed with the 9 dec would crash the spade honours|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|henryb:  Nasty breaks on this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is the 1st of 12 matches for Round Robin  2 -- results aren't posted yet from RR1, but the rotation for RR2 is based upon final tally|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pelu: 1nt had been a nice contract - but prob forcing - but even then I would have passed in S (pd is a passed hand)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|henryb:  I do not know why East wanted a club; a heart would have been more useful|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: results site is http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: the Juniors are playing this in 4@CN|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Frank|pg||
nt|frankaus: part score battles are worth a suprising number of imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Sorry was away from table :(  Will record a claim shortly|pg||
nt|frankaus: 6-8 for a double part score swing mounts up real quick|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: 13th @H might have worked well there|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|henryb:  this will drift down one, but slowly. As I have observed before, no one ever goed dowd wuickly|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|janm: NS have a heart, a spade and a club and EW have 5 or 6 spades (depending whether N's spade trick is taken by a ruff or not), 3 diamonds and at least 2 clubs|pg||
mc|8|nt|kiwi_joker: dummy's diamonds an alluring target - but unreachable|pg||

nt|frankaus: just 3 here|pg||
nt|sybarra: -1 not the end of the world here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: missed opportunity, but any plus may be good on that board|pg||
nt|barnets: would hav been a nice try|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=11-15 HCP, a) 5+@H  b) 4441@D |pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|an| |nt|sybarra: can W stay in his seat |pg||
nt|sybarra: yes seems so |pg||
nt|sybarra: "stay in his seat" as in pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  6@h is a reasonable contract, needing 2-2 hearts or stiff queen|pg||
nt|henryb:  and no club ruff on lead|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Miller-Stout play precision.|pg||
mb|3S|an| |nt|ahollan1: wow  last hand Chinese Taipei Juniors 4@C made 5 |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: interesting choices for Shi over 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N, trap pass, 3@C [@H raise], 2@D all seem to have merit|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe tryingn to get the @D suit in before the ht raise |pg||
nt|henryb:  with various conventions of their own, such as this 3@d bid to show a gf raise|pg||
mb|3N|an| |nt|frankaus: green V red usually a go signal :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes thought he might come in  but suit is a bit tacky |pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is we are in game force sequence here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and protecting against opener having the 4441@D hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Hou pulled out the 4 @s card then changed his mind|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: Not sure about 4@H, as Miller still apparently had the K@S to cue|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N is probably a "serious slam try, while minor suit cues would be "courtesy"|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: i expect this will fail|pg||
nt|janm: Looks as if NS can make about 3 hearts (maybe 4) and EW can make about 3 clubs.|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have an easy partscore in clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: needs the spade lead,   should be -1 |pg||
nt|janm: Let's see if EW can get the spade ruff to beat this. If W leads a high club, E can overtake to lead a spade back|pg||
nt|janm: But on the trump lead I think NS are going to make 4 hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D is a mystery|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|henryb:  I recently saw a study suggesting that with 4-3-3-3 opposite 4-4-3-2  you should not try for the 4-4 major suit fit|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Other room just started to bid Bd 18|pg||
nt|henryb:  Oh? I thought they went back to play 29 and 30|pg||
pc|cA|nt|frankaus: has a chance but its really tough|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: would have to magically read the club suit I think |pg||
nt|janm: So we've had two hands in a row where the best defence would be to take ruffs.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if i would have been any better off with 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: well it both sounds like they have an ace the DO NOT have |pg||
nt|barnets: i think south should x and north bid 3@C|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: (imho)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kiwibridge: E figures to be short so playing 9@S there would have been a decent shot|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Nobuyuki Hayashi|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|frankaus: now @C was req|pg||
nt|pelu: I see the point - but how do u know that ps has 4-4-3-2 :)?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am however convinced that it is losing bridge in general to bid game with two balanced hands and 24 HCP|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: Reid checks to see if 2 tricks is enough to beat 6@H|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: might he be concerned spade is cashing?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Hello from Hamilton.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: @H lead is bad idea now however |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
mc|12|nt|sybarra: Reid might have also been checking backs of cards to see if they match |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: N and E starting taking the bidding cards away before Reid had a chance to X|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told neither NS player is known for being pessimisstic -- @SA not cashing would be way beyond that description|pg||

nt|sybarra: but alas a push|pg||
nt|janm: It will be interesting to see whether the other room manages to get the ruffs to beat either of these first two contracts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NZ Juniors also in 12@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 1@H-(2@C)-3@C|pg||
nt|barnets: trick here is to stay out of slam|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w have every point in the deck except @CAK|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Teramoto is much younger, about 20 years.|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I confess I'd also open 2@s with the S hand - everything is right - vulnerability, position, spades being the highest suit|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Ino won the senior teams in Bejing.|pg||
mb|1C|an| |nt|janm: Of course now that 2@s has been alerted, it probably showed 5 spades and a 4 or 5 card minor, so wasn't even wrong on suit length, but I think it would be right to open it even if ...|pg||
nt|janm: it was just a weak 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same 1@H explanation as last board|pg||
nt|npcjpn: This year, he plays in open.|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: a heavy 2N|pg||
nt|barnets: with 22 hcp and good 5 card suit|pg||
nt|barnets: n./s would be s well to bid 7N as 6 |pg||
nt|barnets: 13  tricks without club lead|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sybarra: ok now can e/w find and make slam? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: notes say Newell has 6@S --- i believe the notes|pg||
nt|sybarra: or can they really make 6 @D without help?|pg||
nt|henryb:  we changed boards all of a sudden|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: east is marginal for a 4N raise|pg||
mb|3C|an| |nt|sybarra: 2 @C looks like "single suited"  |pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is W can tell which suit |pg||
nt|frankaus: sys on  here is normal these days with X replacing 21C|pg||
nt|janm: N probably has a good idea that his partner's second suit is clubs and so won't be useful, but it's certainly possible to envision game anyway.|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT on @dQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  2N clearly a @s raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: yes and systems on= transfer in this case |pg||
nt|ahollan1: interference will slow down EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: with bidding opps suits |pg||
nt|rv: Hi Barnet and all specs|pg||
nt|barnets: hi|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: hard to believe both red suits behaving favorably -- and will probably misguess both Qs anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: olmost certainly its @H now that S trans to @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: and wrong colors to be stepping in with 3 @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry with 3 @C I meant|pg||
mb|4S|nt|janm: I don't know what options he had to invite over the DBL (surely 3@s was not invitational). I think S is going to come to 10 tricks, and he'd probably have accepted most ...|pg||
nt|janm: invitations, with maximum values and good spots in both suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: looks to be a playable spot |pg||
nt|friggi: sure it does|pg||
nt|sybarra: actually 3 nt will work for e/w |pg||
nt|rv: my apologies for the delay, signing in from sunny Bangalore in South India|pg||
nt|barnets: i thnk north will lead a @H|pg||
nt|rv: after 6@d, can North consider an attacking lead?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not much to the play here worst he can lose 3@S 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: same strat as the bidding in Board 1|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@d is apparently a transfer|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now makes many|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 10 tricks, next board.|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@c is a non-standard rebid -- and since I do not have the CC handy, I cannot tell you what it shows|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  but this time I think S whould bid 2N|pg||
pc|c6|nt|frankaus: welcome fridrik|pg||
nt|friggi: ty Frank|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: hi Fridrik :)  welcome|pg||
nt|friggi: Hi Syirley|pg||
nt|janm: Miller knows  that the DBL was a little light, so expects W to have only one spade, and takes the spade finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: some kibber (or you Al)  I am still triying to figure out if e/w can handle 6 @D|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|frankaus: 5 imps to NS here|pg||
nt|barnets: dec has not spades from 6@D bid|pg||
nt|rv: if opps don't have source of tricks and just enough values it pays to passive, after 6@h there was a chance for North to consider @c lead|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|henryb:  ah. I misread the opening bid: a strong club, and 2N probably 11-13 with no 5 card major|pg||

nt|geot: Normal contract reached at both tables. Now swing, or max 1 imp if he for some reason make 620 here|pg||

nt|henryb:  I do not, but it is playable in a sound opening bid structure|pg||

mb|1H|nt|friggi: ye sbut regardless, why give it away without fightingÐ|pg||
nt|friggi: ?|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|sybarra: this looks precision-ish |pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT is likely here|pg||
nt|cascade: does this meet your standard for 2NT Jan?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does not meet my standard, but i might do it anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: sure it is|pg||
nt|janm: I probably wouldn't do it vul, but it's certainly close - I can't imagine bidding anything except 2NT or P|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c will be invitational with hearts|pg||
nt|janm: Presumably 3@c shows some sort of heart raise|pg||
nt|cascade: and Miller finds himself with a surprisingly good hand for all of the bidding so far|pg||
nt|janm: Everyone has different approaches to Unusual, but as far as I know everyone plays that the cue bids show partner's suit and the 4th suit (although some of us use one and some the ...|pg||
nt|janm: other for those meanings)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, STR, F1, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: may be too hard to find|pg||
mb|3S|nt|cascade: yes there are various ways|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure about 4@C|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, especially with partner bidding 2NT vulnerable, Miller must wonder if his side has a game|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c tied to hearts and 3@d tied to spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a transfer over the transfer|pg||
nt|npcjpn: looks like Michaels.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and it is precision  (just not sure which variety) |pg||
nt|frankaus: communications wont be easy |pg||
nt|cascade: personally i play the lower cue agrees partner's suit and the higher is the other suit|pg||
nt|janm: As it is, it's pretty unlucky that 4@c goes down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=FG, 8+ HCP, 5+@D|pg||
nt|npcjpn: dbl = 3-card support?|pg||
nt|henryb:  the black kings are well placed foe N-S|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|friggi: but np for 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is not why i am not sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry wrong cc|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=FG, 10+ HCP, 3+ CNTRL [A=2, K=1], 1-suit, 6+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H RELAY|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have good save in 5@C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2nd suit or repeating the transfer?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: i bet second suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@H=7@D 0@C 33  [or (23)80, 2290]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just what Newell wanted to hear :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: transfer|pg||
nt|sybarra: the good news is E (or W) will have to lead something |pg||
nt|friggi: thne 3H then 3NT|pg||
nt|friggi: dbl tr|pg||
nt|frankaus: first 9 is on top then it gets difficult|pg||
nt|friggi: 3NT is cold|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it might get you way too high and also misdirect the lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not agree with 3N: I think that should show tricks, and 2N should show 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|henryb:  that assumes you open 1N with all balanced 15-17|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT here is 6-10, so Why bid 2NT?|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is the only lead to beat 6N|pg||
nt|pelu: No they play 11-14 NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell has extra King for his 1st seat 1@C -- but can't imagine anything other than 3N now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N is discouraging, but since Reid unlimited it is not pure signoff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Liu still has chance to splinter|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: EW have ended in 5@H on  18|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: nice of @D's to break |pg||
nt|barnets: but never bid|pg||
nt|barnets: only -200|pg||
pc|h7|nt|cascade: Jan tells me she plays the cues the exact opposite way to me|pg||
nt|cascade: the most important thing is that you have an agreement with your partner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 3c for hearts, 3d for spades is the most common|pg||
nt|janm: This time we have a game where the declaring side will need ruffs (diamonds) to make it, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S asks controls   A=2 K=1|pg||
nt|rv: North could have chanced 3@c with enough distribution though suit is not good at these colors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: slam chances looking rather slim|pg||
nt|npcjpn: yes, that's I am afraid of.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he's done it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Chung now has a Powerhouse|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kiwibridge: twin 50's on 18 to Japan for 3 imps|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 4@s, just splinter? or exclusion RKCB?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|cascade: and the defense have ruffs to beat it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N=3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so the hand with void gets to declare?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: contemplating 5@C opposite @SK and @HA?|pg||
nt|barnets: he also may have tried 3@C over 2@S|pg||
pc|c6|nt|janm: Although if he takes the club finesse he's been offered (right you are that the club bid got them off to the wrong lead), he can pitch the diamond losers and then just needs to ...|pg||
nt|janm: avoid a spade ruff (or S needs to figure things out and give his partner one, which may be hard)|pg||
nt|janm: So that will be a third hand that could have been defeated by a defensive ruff |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if so then pass =3|pg||
pc|c8|nt|frankaus: a not so obvious @D lead/switch can couse lots of communications problems|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead gets a bit messy |pg||
nt|rv: West opening is post-modern, I like his raise to 2@s with 3 card fit instead of 2@d|pg||
pc|c9|nt|friggi: no problem. play for @D 3-3 |pg||
nt|pelu: so 2Nt would be 16-17 (18)|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: interesting -- could only do that because of @H10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: glad i'm not at the table -- as declarer i'd go into long tank because of too many possible lines|pg||
nt|npcjpn: nice bidding.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: should be a formality to make it now, wd|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|henryb:  because I think you need 3N to show a very different hand: say Ax, xxx, AKQxxxx, Q|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a) @S ruff  b) @SQ @CAK float @DQ c) @SK then ...|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|janm: Declarer going after those diamond ruffs - but that will probably make it easier for S to realize he needs his partner to have a spade ruff coming, won't it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but as he did not discard a diamond i dont see how defense can go wrong|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|c7|pg||
pc|dA|nt|janm: I think S has to play A and a spade here, doesn't he? |pg||
nt|cascade: he doesnt have many options|pg||
nt|cascade: he would have been better to not overruff but he didnt know that his @hK was always a winner|pg||
pc|dT|nt|fabsayc: even heart heart beats it|pg||
nt|janm: I don't know, it might be tempting to assume that West was doing the right thing and so it's necessary to play trumps to stop the second diamond ruff|pg||
nt|cascade: that works too|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh maybe not south will be endplayed|pg||
nt|janm: I think he can make after heart & a heart, can't he - lead a spade to the K, which either gets him to dummy or endplays S|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: as long as club ace still in dummy|pg||
nt|janm: If N leads a club now, declarer has to ruff, not win the A, which may not be clear|pg||
nt|rv: With West hand, I prefer to rebid 2@d and subsequently bid 2@s or 3@s with extras (14+)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|cT|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cascade: a heart gets him home|pg||
nt|pelu: u also need 2NT to show 16-17|pg||
pc|d3|nt|friggi: wrong line|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|frankaus: trouble brewing|pg||
nt|henryb:  now declarer should draw trump and play a @d to the 9|pg||
mc|11|nt|fabsayc: he had to overtake|pg||
nt|cascade: if he guesses the spade|pg||
nt|janm: No, maybe that won't work - on a clulb at this point, he can ruff, but then has to cross to the heart J and won't have a way back to his hand. But on this return, he can ruff the ...|pg||
nt|janm: low club to pull trump - oops, |pg||

mb|p|nt|geot: because if the clubfinesse had lost and diamonds were 4 with west he was now in trouble|pg||
nt|alanz: Peter and Martins 1@s shows 9-13 with @ds|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|2H|nt|alanz: Reid bidding 2@c pass or correct|pg||
nt|geot: anyway, no problems...and some specs asks if it would have been worse if he was forced with a second heart. |pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|geot: Dont think so, can establish the diamonds and be in control for at least 10 tricks|pg||
nt|alanz: the 1@s bid can have clubs and diamonds, hence Reid's pass or correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: Well stoped by E/W in the CR, as there are two spade losers and two diamond losers |pg||
nt|alanz: Newell thinking about 3@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzkr: N has head in hands|pg||
mb|p|pc|d9|nt|alanz: good decision Peter :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|geot: N/S had naturally bigger ambitions than keeping 2@S to 9 in the CR, so they did not cash the second diamond trick after the diamond lead |pg||

nt|frankaus: brb|pg||
nt|friggi: but N should never play@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead was key for defense |pg||
nt|janm: very tricky hand, obviously, and difficult for declarer to realize that it was necessary to do the very unintuitive thing of stranding the club A in dummy|pg||
nt|henryb:  is that desirable?|pg||
nt|pelu: no but that their system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- i still don't know best line -- even looking at all hands|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: or 13-15|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|rv: North's hand is close to an upgarde for 15-17 nt range|pg||
nt|barnets: north has a super max and 4@S will make|pg||
nt|rv: some might open 1@c and rebid 2n|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: 1m - 1M - 3NT is the hand u show|pg||
nt|ahollan1: TRF |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Looks like Norths diamonds vs the opps respective hearts and spades in this one|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|friggi: play E for High @S |pg||
nt|friggi: let opps play @H|pg||
nt|barnets: i prefer that yes|pg||
nt|barnets: too strong for 1N|pg||
nt|henryb:  North's diamonds do not win the battle|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: what system for new zealand|pg||
nt|janm: Also hard for N to realize that he needed to play the second club to cut declarer's communications :) (I'm not sure why declarer had played the heart ten though - if he hadn't he'd ...|pg||
nt|janm: have been able to overtake the heart J)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 4@S by E has chances but the bad break should scuttle it|pg||
mb|2S|an| |nt|friggi: @C lead not enough|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you ever super accept with weaker nts?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont play them, so just asking |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was just going to say that Newell COULD have bid 3@H as SSGT super-accept  [short suit game try]|pg||
nt|sybarra: for an older person such as me,  I would have to do too much "re-thnking" of system |pg||
nt|henryb:  Is 2@d a transfer or an amorphous force?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: South will pass here in all likelihood, if he had Inv strength he would have Xed 2@c to set up forcing auction till 2n|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Can't tell from the auction, can we? 1@c was alerted, as was 1@d. I'd have said we still didn't know from the alert to 1@c, but probably now it was a strong club and negative ...|pg||
nt|janm: diamond - still not certain|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am told precision|pg||
nt|janm: And what was 2@c by East?|pg||
nt|henryb:  West now emerges with 3N?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i started old -- thinking systems has helped me regress|pg||
nt|sybarra: One Kib suggested bidding  3@H over 2@H (4 crd support, xx in @H)|pg||
nt|barnets: so n/s miss a decent game patly as a rsult|pg||
nt|rv: South chose to pass 2@c and subsequently 2@h since he suspected misfit|pg||
nt|rv: at MPs, many of us would act with South hand|pg||
nt|barnets: cant see why south did not bid 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: the latter i believe|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: certainly gave S, someproblems |pg||
nt|npcjpn: Facing passed partner?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|friggi: the mistake was made by N leading @H after overtaking|pg||
nt|sybarra: N was dummy |pg||
nt|friggi: sorry|pg||
nt|sybarra: just "followed suit" |pg||
nt|friggi: dec|pg||
nt|pelu: almost 8 playing trick - and good gamble here|pg||
nt|barnets: at any scoring|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|janm: After a strong club and negative diamond, I'd have thought 2@c would be natural|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: and another challenging hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: easier for us than at the table|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, sure it is|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, this won't make|pg||
pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: apparently natual is passe|pg||
nt|pelu: here pd had the cards he need: @S-stopper, help in @H and 3 card @d so the suit is running|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: natural|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have the balance of points and the spade suit|pg||
nt|npcjpn: at least undoubled:)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|friggi: that is nice:)|pg||
nt|janm: The bidding is more interesting than the play on this hand. It's out of our "ruffs to beat" set of hands, just a boring 10 top tricks, 3 losers |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: playing J to see if he can get accurate count |pg||
pc|hT|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|friggi: this line is better the play for 3-3 @C|pg||
nt|friggi: then|pg||
nt|janm: I'm told that 2@c showed either diamonds or the Majors|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rv: if South doubles 2@C and subsequently bids 2@S it is likely to be forcing, passing 2@c and bidding 2@s should be NF|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rv: South took conservative route since he suspected misfit/bad breaks|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|cascade: suction|pg||

mb|2S|nt|sybarra: bidding it more of a challenge now |pg||
nt|friggi: not good bid at all|pg||
nt|janm: New Zealand's IMPs came from board 2, where EW were allowed to play in 4@c and didn't make it (so that was a chance for a Hong Kong pickup if they'd gotten the spade ruff to beat ...|pg||
nt|janm: 4@h)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, STR, F1, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL|pg||
nt|rv: 2@c is possibly single suiter here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|janm: The Hong Kong IMPs are from board 3, where the HK N bid game over his partner's 2@s opener|pg||

nt|barnets: 3N makes for 600 against 2@DX for 500|pg||

mb|p|nt|friggi: right|pg||
nt|henryb:  So did East: 4@d shows a good 4@s.|pg||
nt|pelu: also my bid - the hand is too weak to 4@D (namyats)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C takes them out of relay mode -- i think|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: meanwhile closed room seems to have gone to sleep|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I think Namyats should be a better hand than that|pg||
nt|pelu: CC: just a solid suit - but I agree with u|pg||
nt|pelu: and not "solid" :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  My rules (back when I played it) was no 3-loser suit, and not two suits with two fast losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe DBL is relay -- i'm just not sure :(|pg||
nt|rv: at any other colors, West will gleefully doube 2@d, he is likely to bid 3n at these colors|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|nt|sybarra: is this a slam that is biddable?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is very possible that 3@H=exact shape|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|sybarra: 3 @D bid not recommended at home |pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe only at home LOL|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|friggi: helps W to count that hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe "we" are on our way |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so YES Shirley|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|janm: 3@s presumably Smolen, showing a game force with 4 spades and 5 hearts, so that partner can play the hand in hearts; they know they don't have an 8 card fit in spades already|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what to lead|pg||
nt|janm: 3NT is going to be very difficult to make here|pg||
nt|rv: E-W playing negative doubles and forcing pass till 2n after double by West to set up forcing auction|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Kaz Yamada|pg||
nt|npcjpn: now the lead is very important.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cascade: what do you lead from Miller's hand knowing that declarer is probably 4=3 in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 Key Cards + @HQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: but when I bid these,  hts are always 4/1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lucky -- mine 5-0|pg||
nt|ahollan1: AND @S king offside|pg||
nt|kaz08833: hi all|pg||

nt|barnets: can south be stopped from scoring a second club trick ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Kaz welcome|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: i might lead spades as the least destructive|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|rv: I like this treatment as well, prefer positive doubles if we have bid a 4+ card suit naturally and on a similar forcing auction|pg||
nt|npcjpn: nice lead.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rv: East-West should time such defenses very well, need to combine punching declarer and remove his trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: if e/w tap dec he will make 4 @D tricks and a club|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: pity the trumps dont break (just a joke) |pg||
nt|sybarra: yep k off,  I will let you play the 5/0 breaks, and count my blessings|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
nt|janm: Hard to know what to lead, I agree; although leading a 5 card suit is often right, when it's a bad suit and dummy has 4 of them... So I think he's probably right to try to find ...|pg||
nt|janm: partner's suit, just unlucky that he chose the wrong minor|pg||
nt|barnets: if they dont tap he makes 3@D tricks and 2 clubs|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: this seems to need 3-2 trump and nothing awful in @S|pg||
nt|kaz08833: it will go down 3 at least if E misguesss d|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: hold breath now for spade |pg||
nt|ahollan1: NZ has won imps on every board so far -- this another likely swing|pg||
nt|sybarra: (that is spades breaking favorably) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: well -- wouldn't be surprised if swing, but 'likely' is an overbid|pg||
nt|sybarra: China seems to be pushing very hard at other table |pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|janm: So 3NT will make - it was important to lead clubs, not to start setting up N's 5-card suit, but to take the entry out of dummy|pg||

nt|janm: I was wondering about that too - I don't see how he could have done that, but does declarer really have time to set up a club? Say he leads the club Q, now what? North has better ...|pg||
nt|janm: club spots than declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: note the spade suit play |pg||
nt|rv: strong start by Aus pair in this room|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: and that won't be a great result for China either|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: good point Shirley -- must admit that i missed the safety play :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=3-10 HCP, 4+@S & 4+@C/@D|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: but defense does not have enough tricks then|pg||
nt|janm: Declarer has 2 spades, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds (if he uses the club and heart aces for diamond finesses), 1 club, he really can't find 2 more tricks, can he?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ehaa......for the S bid |pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  2-8 HCP  --  i should copy/paste instead of trying to use recall|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be their system others call it Every, Hand An Adventure (EHAA)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: not sure|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: nice 4@S for the NZers here (even 3NT makes)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: battle of spades and hts, |pg||
nt|barnets: 3N and 4@S both make here|pg||

nt|cascade: i just checked double dummy and GIB thinks Miller needed to find the @c8 to defeat 3NT|pg||
nt|janm: Defense might get endplayed out of one trick, but 2? Hard to tell. And of course it isn't easy to lead the club Q either, just easier than leading low|pg||
nt|janm: But GIB lets declarer play double dummy too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EHAA was never this creative|pg||
nt|kaz08833: 9 tricks plaing \s by NS, 8 tricks playing \D by EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: 2@s seems a gross under-bid here|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: ooops|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kiwi_joker: they really needed to find out about the nice secondary fit in @Ds to bid this one|pg||
pc|sT|nt|friggi: should do|pg||
nt|friggi: ??|pg||
nt|sybarra: well indeed that is true!|pg||

pc|s7|nt|janm: Ah, here we see science in action (not!)|pg||

nt|sybarra: I only played it in midnight swisses|pg||
nt|barnets: you put the hex on australia|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|cascade: 2@s will be minimum|pg||
nt|janm: They got to the right spot of course, but does N really know that his partner can't have enough for 7? Make the diamond Q the club Q for instance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might gain by not helping defense to lead|pg||
nt|cascade: i am pretty sure they dont play 2/1 FG|pg||
nt|fabsayc: remember is precision|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: so 2s is definitely limited|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 3@s is not invitational, so pass looks automatic.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rv: with 5@s and super-max for passed hand, I would have started with 2@h with West hand|pg||
nt|rv: lol|pg||
nt|barnets: as they miss a good game especially on th e bidding|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|janm: Even if 2/1 isn't FG, couldn't he at least bid 2@c and then blackwood and tell his partner they had all the keycards and adequate trumps - S would know that AQx of clubs was golden|pg||

nt|pelu: 4@D or 4@s by West?|pg||
nt|rv: I intend to drive to game in any case and in my opinion 2@h gives more flexibility|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: hmmm will other room get to game after West open's strong 1@C?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|janm: I suppose there could be QJ in front of the K and A over it, but I don't think bidding scientifically will make it any easier for them to find that|pg||
nt|cascade: they have another chance to showcase their slam bidding|pg||
nt|pelu: see NSs problem after 4@s|pg||
nt|henryb:  somewhat difficult to get to 6@h-- maybe less difficult when West chooses not to open a large number of spades|pg||
mb|2D|nt|pelu: 12-13 tricks on @Dq|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: both directions have hands that fit together beautifully.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|janm: This time S has a positive response to 1@c|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@H=ART, 9-13 HCP, 4+@S, 0-3@H, maybe longer @C/@D|pg||
nt|kaz08833: its highly likely NS will play 2NT which will go down|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D usually 2/3@D but ....|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|sybarra: but can W lead a @D easily|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6c is better|pg||

nt|sybarra: may not be best spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell had option to bid 3@C showing MAX with longer @C|pg||
nt|barnets: Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: South's action is surely too timid though it is hardly clearcut to bid at 5 level|pg||
nt|barnets: would show  the @HA|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cascade: anyway the answer was yes easily|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@D likely down if diamonds 4-1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@C would still have chances|pg||
nt|kaz08833: with other Q N shd pass it's unfortunate judge by N|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kiwibridge: the slam was NOT found so 13 well earned imps to CT|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: I kinda blame Stout a bit here .. he has chance to bid 3@C, which would have pushed pd's buttons (and they would never defend 5@Dx then)|pg||

nt|janm: The reason I think the strong club might hurt on this hand is more psychological than real - N starts out thinking he has a minimum and doesn't revise that idea|pg||

nt|janm: Another void opposite partner's long Major!|pg||

nt|sybarra: My guess is N/S feel good about their game, but not as good as it  will score up |pg||
mb|1S|nt|rv: on @d lead, declarer pitches a @h, draws a round of trumps and plays a @c out|pg||

nt|fabsayc: double allows for 1nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D/@H are Transfer Preempts -- only 3@C is nat pre|pg||
nt|babs59: Paul Gosney has also qualified for the Australian Under 26 team - which meant that for NZ PABF he has been replaced in the team|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|janm: True, but I'm afraid the doubleton club would keep me from doubling - I think I'd end up being a chicken and passing - maybe bid 1NT?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 21 it was|pg||
nt|davidstern: They may have right sided this to avoid a heart lead|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: on 25  China in 4@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: glaned at conv. cards, and were more than I could deal with at this time of night |pg||
nt|sybarra: *glanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've been studying newell-reid system for a while in preparation of this PABF|pg||
pc|hA|nt|babs59: but he will be representing Australia in the World Youth Series in Philadelphia in October|pg||
nt|davidstern: So 9 top tricks now 1-1-2-5|pg||

nt|sybarra: welcome Al |pg||
nt|barnets: i am told its a double round robin|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|janm: However, pushing the opponents up a level was certainly a good thing, because it looks as if 2@s will be very difficult to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: partner will only bid clubs with 5, then the support is adequate|pg||
nt|barnets: tks |pg||
nt|barnets: nick|pg||

pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: get a new partner jan :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if i had say 2524 i would rebid 2c|pg||
nt|janm: Once upon a time, I doubled 1@d with 4441 (in that order). My partner waited until the 4 level to bid his 4 card club suit!! Taught me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so i think here double suggests some diamond length|pg||
nt|janm: I would be more likely to DBL with 2524, and certainly with 1534, but I think you're convincing me to bid 1NT|pg||

nt|babs59: in politically correct terms - Pacific Asia Bridge Federation :)|pg||
nt|kaz08833: what's the point is if EW can make 4@h|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: here the 2-opening-style worked perfect|pg||

mb|r|nt|sybarra: I dont play 3/2 well with no high cards LOL|pg||
nt|cascade: Stout is on the way to 4@s|pg||
nt|janm: 2@h is 5 hearts and a 4+ minor, I guess - I confess I wouldn't have made this one |pg||
nt|janm: Hopefully 3@d showed both diamonds and a minimum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N would have been 13-15 unless partnership doesn't allow 5422|pg||
nt|babs59: in 2011 the PABF will be held in Macau|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: 5-4-2-2 equal minimum - you have to have some standards|pg||
nt|henryb:  although 2@s would certainly work out just fine as a contract|pg||
nt|pelu: @c-lead - normal here - dont work - there are 5 @S-tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: that is what is commonly played|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c/@d = minimums|pg||
nt|janm: Now is 3@s forcing?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not to me|pg||
nt|cascade: and 3@h/@s = maximums with @c/@d respectively|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but then i dont open this crap|pg||
nt|cascade: lets hope not and they have discussed it|pg||
nt|janm: So Miller has shown a minimum, will he decide it's good enough to raise if 3@s isn't forcing?|pg||
nt|cascade: he does have an ace and a fit|pg||
nt|babs59: I have a suspicion that both Zone 6 and Zone 7 will use it for selection purposes for the World Championships|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: oops operator |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkt: sorry a bit sleepy after lunch :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Probably N could have bid 3@s over 2@h to invite in spades, so maybe this should be forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: I know I do not play their system since that is not a neg X for m |pg||
nt|sybarra: for mi|pg||
nt|rv: Double of 2@c by West is t/o and need not have extras|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: need some coffee or tea |pg||
nt|janm: The 2@h bid did keep EW from getting to too many hearts :)|pg||
nt|cascade: there are lots of ways to bid spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Shirley -- you mean Hou's DBL?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I would not X with that hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: many experts play this treatment below 2M level after 1M-1N-(2X by opps)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: (or a beer) |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: negative dbl with 4+@H -- what's wrong with that?|pg||
nt|rv: double above 2M level on 1M-1N-(2/3X by opps) is still t/o with extras (15+)|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d7|nt|janm: Or maybe he can't if E puts the diamond K up on a lead towards dummy |pg||
nt|cascade: i think he has to lose at least one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: first off, it is only a 7 count,  pard never knows I have 5 hts.  and never knows to bid them |pg||
nt|rv: North should have surely competed to 3@c|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|friggi: do you agree?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can handle any minor suit rebid from partner too|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s3|nt|janm: Of course N doesn't know he has spade losers, so is just trying to lose a trick in each side suit and ruff the second club loser|pg||

nt|pelu: in Board 8: taipei in 7@h - and lost @DQ - West had also open only 1@S - with a 4@S-opening more easy to find @DQ - but diff to bid 7 :)|pg||
nt|rv: traditionally Chinese Taipei and Indonesia were top teams in Zone 6, now it is very competitive with China, Japan etc making rapid strides in world bridge|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|friggi: risky|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=ART, 9-13 HCP, 4+@H, maybe longer @C/@D/@S|pg||
nt|rv: China is arguably the strongest team in whole of Asia (Zone 4-BFAME, 6-Far East) now|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: This is a real blind spot by Jeff... he should just have continued @Ds ..after that good fortune in the spade suit, he had 5@Ds, 3@Ss and a club for a certain 9|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kiwibridge: 2 tricks in the play and 7 back to CT on 23|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Well, apparently he somehow made it and now we get to see the Precision 2@c in action|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=F1 , 4+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=a) 5@H(332)  b) 4441@S c) 2452 d) 1453|pg||
nt|barnets: multi 21D|pg||
nt|rv: some play lebensohl from North hand on 2@h by West|pg||
nt|barnets: south better not pass|pg||
mb|3D|an| |nt|sybarra: and not wasted values here |pg||
nt|sybarra: well maybe the q of @D's|pg||
nt|friggi: right, freindly layout and lead as well|pg||
nt|cascade: a subdued Miller and Stout here should win back some IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Yes, surely he'll make at least 3 :)|pg||
nt|cascade: or rather too much aggression at the other table to wind up to 5@c|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we may play it here also |pg||
mb|4D|nt|barnets: now 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: friendly|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well forget that statement|pg||
nt|kaz08833: i guess the score is almost tie because Japan will gain another 8 on bd 25|pg||
mb|5D|nt|barnets: I like 4@H - 5@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  6@s looks like a much better contract|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@S|pg||
nt|npcjpn: on this hand, NS can make 3NT, but no way to reach..|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@H confirming 5@H along the way to showing max 1N|pg||
nt|rv: yes good auction|pg||
nt|rv: is Peng's 4N quant here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: hopefully no one leads trumps too soon |pg||
nt|janm: I think a 3@c rebid with the N hand was what pushed them too high - it just has too much in the short suits and too many quacks|pg||
nt|babs59: the other table started with North bidding 2@H - both majors, weak|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: in college we defined  Down 1 = Good Bridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- i was enrolled in college   no - i didn't go to class as often as i went to bridge table|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL  |pg||
nt|sybarra: but we made it thru right?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after a mere 16 years|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i made LM in decent time|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|sybarra: some of us "dashed" thru faster than that,  but my father who often was nice enough to pick my up from school always knew where to find me |pg||
nt|rv: I suspect not though it could be for many other partnerships since fit is not found|pg||
nt|barnets: ok well done|pg||
nt|rv: as Barnet suggested, Peng should bid 4@h to show good @s fit, mild slam try|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rv: and his direct 4n should possibly be quant?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|barnets: try and give a ruff|pg||
pc|d5|nt|barnets: looking at dummys diamonds|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|henryb:  @h by E-W should work out well, but you had better correct that|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pelu: hi Amando undo - 61H by N|pg||
nt|pelu: Amanda|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pelu: in OR West bid 3@d|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|barnets: only chance|pg||
nt|rv: as score stands with 1 deal to go, Aus winning match by 21-9|pg||
nt|rv: with only 5 VPs behind leaders Taipei before this round, this win could even more them to first place|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|pelu: Lead @DK to A and now @HA made the play easy|pg||
nt|henryb:  he may go down now|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: (student union bridge and euche room)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|henryb:  a lot, in fact|pg||
nt|pelu: need to finess in @s to make|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: *euchre |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|rv: sry 22-8 as score stands now|pg||
nt|barnets: declarer has no sure line|pg||
nt|rv: Check site http://www.qldbridge.com/director/downloads/WBF%20VP%20SCALE.pdf for WBF VP scale for diff boards|pg||

nt|friggi: 3NT in N/S|pg||
nt|janm: What were you saying about 8 card suits yesterday, Wayne?|pg||
nt|cascade: well there have been plenty of 8s and 9s the first two days|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are occuring too often|pg||
nt|barnets: i think|pg||
nt|barnets: its close|pg||
nt|rv: Aus moving towards magic 25 VP mark, now leading 23-7 with wrong end of VP scale (1 more IMP to reach 24)|pg||
nt|barnets: after the wk two bid|pg||
nt|davidstern: Strange declarer is pitching diamonds which can be ruffed rather than clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: And what would you do with this one? Pass and hope to bid later? Open 1, or open a bunch?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: China on the board!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and our last bd of this set |pg||
nt|barnets: they like the multi|pg||
nt|barnets: so do I|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: last board to the match now, thanks very much to Nobuyuki and Kaz for their great comments, thz Amanda on the vugraph, great job, and thx all specs for your feedback|pg||
nt|npcjpn: thanks all.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: join us agin tomorrow|pg||
nt|kaz08833: thanks all too|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3NT N/S here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: thx to out wonderful operator,   great job as always |pg||
nt|alchilds: easy|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Friggi, and Al,  and Frank and Pat, who were here earlier |pg||
nt|friggi: thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thank you. back in  a bit oveer 30 minutes- lets hope I am more awake then :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: But no easy road to get there|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: and of course great thx to our specs, for the helpful (and sometimes humorous comments |pg||
nt|janm: Lau chose the latter course (when I'm playing that 4 of a minor is natural, I love to be able to open it)|pg||
nt|davidstern: North will make a move and South has a max perhaps they will find it|pg||
mb|2C|nt|henryb:  another ambitious 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remaining matches for the day are posted now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: next will be Open: Australia v China Macau   Senior: Indonesia v New Zealand (Cornell)|pg||
mb|d|nt|janm: In the other room, East also opened 4@c but his partner judged to raise |pg||
nt|kaz08833: this one shd be push|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: ah, the hand that needs the heart shift|pg||
nt|cascade: an interesting point is that I think that dealing programs need to have published their algorithms to allay suspicion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing 2@C = weak @C + another|pg||
nt|davidstern: There you go|pg||
mb|2D|nt|henryb:  on 24HC with no particular source of tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: still a few boards to be played and scored in the open room|pg||
nt|davidstern: So this should be 7 imps to Indonesia assuming 0-1-4-5|pg||
nt|davidstern: For ten tricks|pg||
mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: overtake and heart seems right|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: my guess was 3@C 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: quick shot of something then for you....(what ever that is) |pg||
mb|2N|nt|alchilds: my too may go set|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, and maybe the spade 10 should suggest shifting to a heart?|pg||
nt|pelu: again the 1NT 6-12 created the problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid -- 1st DBL = PEN  2nd DBL = Takeout [i think]|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|janm: Guess not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think any spade but ace is really wrong|pg||
nt|janm: Of course, they're not going to beat 4 whatever they do|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: needs @H play from Dec, diff to find|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is will play @D up from hand |pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N was 13-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S shift is killer|pg||
nt|sybarra: can China make a profit here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  this one needs 3@c tricks, a reasonable shot, and either 4@h and 2@s or lots of spade tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: in normal system u would pass 2@S|pg||
nt|rv: this should make 9 tricks even with likley @s finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: best lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  My stomach is growling, so I will leave you. Have fun, and thanks, Peter|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rv: we are playing last board of this match|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|cascade: For those kibitzers who are interested in chess|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: absolutely -- i was thinking best defense 300|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rv: my thanks to excellent Vu graph operator and wonderful co-commentators Barnet Shenkin and Barbara Travis|pg||
nt|babs59: and thank you RV and Barnet, for not jinxing Australia too much|pg||
pc|h8|nt|fabsayc: no so maybe here a bit more excusable|pg||
nt|barnets: well tks all specs and fellow commentators I am retiring for the night |pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|rv: also a word of appreciation to Roland Wald who organises all these Vu graph broadcats and BBO management for telecasting it live|pg||
nt|rv: finally to all specs for listening to us patiently|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cascade: about 8 or 9 times i have lost count|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: maybe 500 now|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s7|nt|janm: Interesting how many people are good at both games|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: there is a dealing program written by a norwegian|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which produces a lot of wild hands|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks like that program|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is used by some of the dealing equipment|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so wherever the equipment goes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and i am totally convinced the hands are not random|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the technical term is pseudo random|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in a run of say a million hands it should converge on the theoretical odds |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: romm will stay open unti scores are finalised|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H10 would have been very trusting - an maybe worthy of write-up|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting position now however |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D best|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Can't remember the other one|pg||
nt|babs59: Under 26 Australia v Japan|pg||
nt|Walddk4: One from the U21 I think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh, thx|pg||
