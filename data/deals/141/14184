nt|sfoxa:  4@c shows better @h, while 4@d emphasizes @s|pg||

nt|rnmalik: true|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: hear 3@D then 3N?|pg||
nt|cicus: no, then pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all and hello Nicoleta |pg||
pc|d5|nt|cicus: few @Ds and only a single stopper makes 3NT unattractive|pg||
nt|cicus: let alone some missing HCP's|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: this stage of declarer play is MOST important: the planning|pg||
nt|cicus: now W can take a ruff but the losing @C can be discarded on the 4th spade later|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: can he guess, that @s3 is a single?|pg||
nt|caitlin: I also would not bid 3N, but wondered if North would|pg||
nt|dimi: a lot of bidding with those flat hands|pg||
nt|shevek: south's turn to have the "ugly" hand|pg||
pc|d6|nt|h_karluk: x and xx , don't ask me i am new at the town:)|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|h_karluk: allright xx removed|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Losing 2 @H and a @C|pg||
nt|mcarroll: meanwhile, this 3NT does not look like making|pg||
nt|sybarra: "we" might be a trick or so short here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 26 hcp but with @S lead, this contract does not make.|pg||
nt|shevek: hi shirley, everyone |pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: hi all, welcome|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|xenya: should not be difficult to guess @Ds i think...|pg||

pc|s6|nt|sybarra: not sure much makes on the 3 level |pg||
nt|xenya: wrong!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|h_karluk: which is fine as well|pg||

nt|rnmalik: W can see and count 12 cards in @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|mcarroll: true my fault for trying to multi-task, trying to keep an eye on Monaco qualifying|pg||
nt|cicus: E could have played a small @S here but it does not help as he has only 1 @C|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|shevek: I agree with stopping in 2NT with 25hcp in two flat hands (am I old fashioned? )|pg||

pc|s7|nt|h_karluk: you know another busy week on BBO vugraph theatre, anyways nice humorous approaches are always inside crew, cool:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: yes, for me it was also very busy in the last few days... but i like the job, its also a lot of fun :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2nd double could be optional <on some rare CC> as they knew spades their suit|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's great, i cannot wait my shift ends to have a cold beer :P|pg||

nt|jcmax: Hmmm. is it just a 1-day tournament?|pg||
nt|jcmax: sry folks...|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Sabine,  you are always welcome |pg||
nt|rnmalik: It was -1 and now in an effort to make it would be -2.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: no this Tournament goes from Friday till Sunday|pg||
nt|sybarra: from earlier explanation I saw,  the round robin, moves folks up and down the ranks|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: many Teams, who played the Bonn Nations Cup at Wednesday/Thursday stayed here to play the German Trophy too|pg||
pc|h8|nt|h_karluk: 1st doubles are mostly t/o|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: Round Robin was just at the beginning of the Tournament, now they play Swiss System|pg||
nt|rnmalik: So by the end of the day we have 4 top teams. Am I right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: they play in 3 groups, and always after some rounds there come 2/3 teams into the lower group/better group|pg||
nt|caitlin: if he does, he is definitely down|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: now he is reading in the convention card, maybe it helps for his decission...|pg||
nt|caitlin: or count on hand but hard to know if third seat 3@C is 6 or 7 card suit|pg||
nt|cicus: west may be 1327|pg||
pc|d2|nt|h_karluk: unless they start with a level more than 4|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|caitlin: a clue is that East did not return club, trying to set one up|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: now he needs to get hearts right to limit the losses|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe only 7 tricks now|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d4|nt|sfoxa:  Is Hungarian "Winkiboy" named after their lead - Winkler? I suppose|pg||
nt|xenya: so 3@H was makeable|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not like the 2 @S bid,  (not resulting hand) but seems a bit much |pg||
nt|caitlin: oh well, understandable from declarer's point of view|pg||
nt|cicus: I can't say this was not percentage play, although what if west has only 6 clubs?|pg||
nt|cicus: is that prohibited when vulnerable?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: and squeeze pard at the same time |pg||
pc|c9|pc|d9|nt|cicus: of course in that case E made a defensive error by not returning a small spade instead of cashing !ge Queen|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|s3|nt|caitlin: not at all but seems East would have sent through club, trying to set up second trick, which he could do with ONE or TWO|pg||

nt|vugraphzjk: NS play swedish standard with 4c openings. EW do also play very natural, though the opening 1@c contains all 16+ hands|pg||

nt|yuval10: sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thx|pg||
nt|chick: since EW have no game or even good partscore, this should be an excellent result for them|pg||
nt|yuval10: against 3NT @d lead defeat and @s lead give the contract away|pg||
nt|arvidsson: Emmas got a relly good hand now, with partner supporting hearts|pg||

nt|xenya: we are confronted with lots of artificial bids on both sides it seems|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Nevertheles it is N's Major holding which will allow this contract to survive|pg||
nt|turnip1: establishing spades is right, but most likely he will try the diamonds|pg||

nt|mcarroll: I have seen many Ws use Michaels on this hand - not my choice I hasten to add|pg||
nt|chick: I don't think 3@C is a very helpful bid in this situation|pg||
nt|arvidsson: thye have all the ques, just missing AQ of @H|pg||
nt|friggi: they go for a slam|pg||
nt|chick: so all he needs is either spades 3-3, or heart finesse on|pg||
nt|andyv:  does S have a play for this with reasonable defense?|pg||

nt|friggi: dec has to take @C A nad fin @S |pg||
nt|arvidsson: doubt he will play for KQ of @D onside|pg||
nt|friggi: agree, but that is the hand you have to draw, if you want to have a chance my friend:)|pg||
nt|s bech: I Dont think spade finesse is best line. just ruff one spade in dummy and try to only have 2 heart loosers|pg||
nt|s bech: or should you play clubs for 5-1 becouse of the lead?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: the best chance must be to play for @H 3-2 (being able for 2 loosers) and clubS 4-2?|pg||
nt|s bech: I think so|pg||
nt|friggi: dec has to play for sin @H|pg||
nt|arvidsson: but the lead is fishy.... maybe one can sniff the 5-1 |pg||

nt|chick: a knowledgable kib suggests that this might be xy-nt probably 2 c inviting........any hand............. and 2d gameforcing|pg||
nt|daman: a bit unsettling for commentators when the systems are highly unusual|pg||
nt|peachy: the alert shows 1NR as trf, if I understand it correctly, both sides trf?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one might say: "yes but N has AKQ of trumps, and S who was missing them made a try".  true enough, but it was already those 3 top trumps that were the only possible justification ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for the 2S raise, so N has already bid that part of his hand|pg||

nt|cuttysark: As you say, he did very well to bid at all - I suppose he was trying to shut out the opener|pg||
nt|chick: unless the X shows diamonds, which is possible I guess|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The standard in Sweden must be pretty high given that two of the strongest teams in the country, S:t Erik Berik (last year's winners) and Malmö (with Fredin, Bertheau and Nyström) ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: were knocked out in the semi-finals|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if opener's are 6 up, passouts are impossible|pg||
nt|yuval10: if their system is to open from 6 and higher count, then it's probably safe to say they've never experienced any "all pass" in their partnership|pg||

nt|s bech: heart finesse safe. Makes eather way|pg||
nt|s bech: Ruff a spade or discard on diamonds if V wings with heart K and continue hearts|pg||
nt|chick: if W wins and returns a heart, where does the losing spade go?|pg||
nt|s bech: on diamonds|pg||
nt|chick: ah, yes, you are right, because E cannot play a 3rd spade|pg||
nt|s bech: if East holds up K of diamonds when finessed south has no diamond looser|pg||
nt|chick: I don't like 2N ... with a misfit (traditionally 5521 opposite 1255), it usually takes about 29 HCP to make 3N ... EW have only 23|pg||

nt|chick: is there a basis for that in the odds?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  can't prove if it works - didn't collect statistics|pg||
nt|po-s: will most likely make - South rates to be shorter in hearts after his double of 2D so small to HJ will solve trumps|pg||

nt|vugraphzjk: The explanation of the 3@c bid is inaudible, I apologize|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am guessing down 4|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|jtr: Evet|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C by N?|pg||
nt|sybarra: think we missed a pass  |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 2 imps to Winkiboy on 2 -- same contract but declarer took 8 tricks |pg||
nt|dimi: i think 6@s by W is on|pg||
nt|dimi: by E a @c lead will beat|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|xenya: did N really double here?|pg||

mb|2S|nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|friggi: that is more like it:)|pg||
nt|xenya: he has a pure yarborough|pg||
nt|xenya: but he also has 3 hearts in support for partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl2: we had some problems with connections or so, now we're back:)|pg||
nt|cicus: 3@S must be a transfer to 3NT|pg||
mb|3S|nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: 3NT needs some work|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i admit was indeed disciplined as David wisely pointed out|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe that accounts for it? |pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: yes|pg||
nt|cicus: then they probably play 3NT rsponse as some self-dangerous artificial bid :)|pg||
nt|shevek: pity it's wrongsided|pg||
mb|6S|nt|sfoxa:  S is happy to show both - maximum overcall and @h with his DBL|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: maybe with little defense, we ll see|pg||
nt|jtr: I am sure Salvo will find a way|pg||
nt|h_karluk: is he a magician, i thought i am alone:)|pg||
nt|jtr: @d to the 7 at trick 2 i guess|pg||
nt|xenya: so N didn't psyche at adverse vulnerability after all :)|pg||
nt|shevek: hmmm|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 was ok,  2 is certainly mor difficult |pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Not at all  Lovely guy too|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  seems, N wasn't sure about @h|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @S is puppet,  saying I have 4 @H |pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 3NT-top 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will make in a breeze |pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: forgetting one pass makes everybody confused :-D|pg||
nt|friggi: yes 2NT should be 23-24|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe cuebidding would have been better|pg||
nt|dimi: 3@s was forcing?|pg||
nt|shevek: didn't think so|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: on 3 NS in the other room stopped in a quiet 1N making -- 12 imps to Winkiboy |pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: NS*|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: 4 hts pretty easy also |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jtr: OK This worked better|pg||
nt|dimi: a kip told me it would be forcing ... hmmm|pg||
nt|shevek: 7 certain tricks , one will come from @d or @c|pg||
pc|s6|nt|shevek: even so, BW with a void wouldn't be recommended|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: for W 3@s is forcing, but they dont agree about this bid|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
nt|dimi: right Nicoleta|pg||
pc|s2|nt|h_karluk: i have to be objective and impartial, however "gl sahib" :) (friendly code between I and him since long years)|pg||
nt|shevek: aha|pg||
pc|h7|pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: just a bit messier |pg||
nt|friggi: like 3NT better|pg||
nt|cicus: S has to return @Ds to cut dummy off its @S10|pg||
nt|cicus: @S9  , I mean|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|sT|nt|xenya: i wish i knew the meaning of all those bids, but the final contract is almost perfect |pg||
nt|xenya: 4@S was a fair alternative of course|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mcarroll: But as it turns out, @D play better, the 4-1 @H split would make a @H contract at the 3 level a major problem|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes but given the 4/4 fit at the table we probably all select 4 @H |pg||
nt|shevek: is north considering a duck here?|pg||
nt|shevek: after all north wouldn't have a clue that west holds 6@hs :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: if so, East gets an overtrick...|pg||
nt|dimi: can't believe ... maybe on his way to bar?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|friggi: truth but that bidding is overrated given that you miss a lot of Aces:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy for us to second guess from this altitude |pg||
nt|shevek: here...|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|cicus: well, not necessary, as E has only 8 tricks anyway|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jtr: kinderleicht ein Kinderspiel|pg||
pc|d6|pc|sK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: if you play like this in brd 12, you tell the opponents: "I think you are stupid" ...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|h_karluk: logical line|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|caitlin: West was overly optomistic, for sure|pg||
nt|cicus: oops, now S can be endplayed into leading away from @CK|pg||
nt|cicus: could have unblocked @HQ|pg||
nt|caitlin: should have|pg||
nt|cicus: even|pg||
nt|cicus: he knew N had solid @Hs|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: If Ron Pachtmann will use this option? We will see...|pg||
nt|caitlin: the @HJ by North showed a good sequence of T9 as well |pg||
nt|caitlin: does he know he has an endplay?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: but with QJ109 he would discard Q (and not J) at first, isnt it so?|pg||

pc|s7|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||

pc|s9|nt|cicus: yes, he knows the location of the @HQ, only does not know it is doubleton|pg||

nt|yuval10: even though it's an excellent contract|pg||
nt|ziff:  Yes|pg||
nt|s bech: East bidding suggests Jacoby. well, we might get to see these 1D openings. they seem to be rather common. Lucky for E/W howeber to get away with 200 |pg||
nt|s bech: powerful hand north. 4 spades shoud make with an overtrick|pg||
nt|chick: easy 4@S, but EW have a good save in 5@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I also considered that, and neither N nor S had an obvious lead, but I can't imagine them actually bidding it|pg||
nt|pbundy: despite the distribution, 3@C would be my call here, too.  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: Polish 1C opening is usually something like this 12-14 HCP, balanced (usually without 4 diamonds) or 4=4=1=4; 15+ HCP with a real club suit;18+ HCP with any shape|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The main problem with the Swedish 1C opening is the lack of flexibility: the "strong" hand types have to take a second bid (or else risk not showing their strength), which does not ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: work well if those hands are not pure two-bid hands. |pg||
nt|chick: this could be bad if EW end in 3N |pg||
nt|chick: 2@C artificial forcing to game|pg||

nt|chick: and now 3@S is cheap to bid|pg||
nt|chick: when you can identify a double-fit against a double-fit, it's important to win the contract ... very risky for a double game swing.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: Polish Club is slightly better in this respect since it is a more conservative system. In Swedish Club, the strong hands typically start at 17 HCP, whereas Polish Club requires ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: about one point more than that.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: This may not sound like much of a difference, but it does tend to make the strong types a little more pure.|pg||

nt|mr murray: one kibbitzer says 5 diamonds a make|pg||
nt|bridge_one: similar at overcall of 1Nt (polish style) with 4Maj and 5+minor, but giving the suit over 1@c strong (here, playing 2 way, is less effective)|pg||

nt|pbundy: 3@S could be making - along with 3@H.........|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Agreed|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, partnerships need to discuss the difference between pass and 3@S here by E.  One possible understanding is that when pd's cuebid has forced us to a certain level (here, ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@S), bidding it directly shows the weakest hand - and anything else, even passing, shows at least a modicum of game interest.|pg||
nt|yuval10: but as Meckstroth said - those "little"  imps adds quickly|pg||
nt|ziff:  Good decision by N/S, anyway|pg||
nt|arvidsson: lookes like they will end up in an unlucky slam |pg||
nt|chick: I still think it was safer to just win the @HA and get the ruff ... but I suppose at this level, an overtrick can be important|pg||

nt|jcwla: Even if not, the principle applies to situations where pd has made a conventional raise forcing us to a particular level.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: holding three dead hearts, W probably viewd the negative double as a danger sign when LHO did not bid hearts. also the overcall perhaps is sometimes made on 4 cards. and as u say, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has probably seen the likes of this E hand and perhaps worse:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Right but need partnership agreement -- many pairs play the exact opposite: pass below the level of our force shows some interest.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Back in a flash.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes i never doubted that 2N showed spade support. my question was whether it promised four of them|pg||
nt|yuval10: why didn't S lead a @d ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think N should ask himself that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also, that question was not addressed to the principle you were stating Jordan. I was simply looking for reasons why W did not force to game|pg||
nt|andyv:  white on white save may win a few imps|pg||
nt|po-s: he mght also double and take it 4 down...|pg||
nt|turnip1: 4H make on 3 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|rado: 3NT also an option|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Probably a similar defence to what they play over 1NT - to save memory strain|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@d are ON, of course, so the overcall worked very well|pg||
nt|yuval10: you can say Erev tov to Ida as well...she'll understand u well|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: this may put Westerlund back up in the scores|pg||
nt|chick: as xenya said last session ... unusually normal :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: some plays 1@d xfer @h|pg||
nt|chick: well, credit to them finding a contract that has a chance|pg||
nt|affe82:  without interference that downside is negliable though.|pg||
nt|yuval10: E must bid 6@s now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: Shalom Roland|pg||
nt|yuval10: he already bid 4@s to show minimum|pg||
nt|chick: he may not, has to discount his @HQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Shabat Shalom Ida :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: he already discounted it with 4@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: after W made another try with 5@c he must respect it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's the case when Q is better than K|pg||
nt|yuval10: AX @d is an asset|pg||
mb|p|nt|aldek: na Acolu z karami otwieramy w holandii 2@D, zeby grac od silnej reki|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and good swith at trick 2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure why S doubled--was on top of 2S bid and has no heart card|pg||
nt|yuval10: for those who joins us now - the score is incorrect and is upside-down|pg||
nt|s bech: Hans-Ove picks up another 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|affe82: this will be hopeless. as (several) kibber(s) say any defence is setting|pg||
nt|po-s: sorry only 3|pg||
nt|ritong: ah ok|pg||
nt|rado: 2/4 leads for NS|pg||
nt|ignatov_bg: deklaranta moje da izvadi, no trqbva da izcaka 1 pika na mora i posle da  napravi impas trefa ot hod|pg||

nt|boomelant: kara zniknely niestety|pg||
nt|tomek: po 2@S 3@H|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed 5@D is a fortunate make but with a combined 20 count and no special features...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 10 cards in the minors in West are good distributionals value|pg||
nt|mr murray: if opener was an American "naturale" diamond n/s dont buy the hand so easily|pg||
nt|cuttysark: True - the overcall made it impossible for Wset to bid diamonds on his own|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes Murray, 1@D open would work here|pg||
nt|s bech: so we´ll see a swing on scoreborad soon in favour of Skalman|pg||
nt|chick: a boring partscore here ... time to put your laundry in the fridge or get a beer from the dryer ... or is it the other way around?|pg||
nt|affe82: this board can lead to a shift of leaders|pg||
pc|d5|nt|atalok: ama mecbur býraktýlar 4 h demeye|pg||

nt|chick: this will go down, I'm not sure either side had a making contract |pg||
nt|chick: if the other table doesn't reach slam|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: exciting bidding -- i don't think i agree with W's 2 passes|pg||
nt|chick: agree, but perhaps he was afraid of pushing them to game ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Friendly placement of cards.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we convinced him )))|pg||
nt|yuval10: well bided|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|chick: still, no excuse not to pull his partners double with a 6-5 black hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The natural option of the 1C opening bid contains hands of 15-17 HCP which are almost certainly not pure two-bid hands, and so these can be a problem.|pg||
nt|daman: compressed 4 @D tricks into 3 :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: real score is 33:22 to Gullvi|pg||
nt|ziff:  "Real" score is 33-22, Gullvi|pg||
nt|ziff:  :)|pg||
nt|friggi: he wants to beat the contract - I guess:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: you can use the running score here: http://www.swangames.com/magic/magic/www.php?csm=Match&nsid=242|pg||

pc|hK|nt|yuval10: the contract is making now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mrdct: yes didn't see much to gain from @c continuation|pg||
nt|chick: someone asks why E didn't double .....|pg||
pc|h8|nt|yakop: 2cle 4nt diyecek el var nerdeyse|pg||

nt|mlodygda83: tak, wyranie mia³ chwilê s³aboci|pg||
nt|xenya: nor with E's double, for that matter -- looks borderline at best  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, E may even have been a bit reluctant to sign off in 4S, given that he had a very good hand facing a heart splinter|pg||
nt|arvidsson: with the heart lead|pg||
nt|friggi: that is a nice way to say it:)|pg||

nt|turnip1: no unlikely defence|pg||
pc|d7|nt|atalok: 4 h normal  bence|pg||
nt|chick: stopping in a partscore after a strong club opening and an A and K with E surprises me|pg||
nt|h_karluk: These hands are also present in the 1C opening in standard systems, but there you have the option of rebidding in a new suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tempting to jump to 6S over 5C by W, but if W has a heart void there could be a grand slam|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|chick: but they must have some way of putting on the brakes|pg||
nt|daman: he will have to finesse the Jxxx of @Hs to make this|pg||
nt|daman: his @C spots stink|pg||

nt|shevek: now for a 12-card fit...|pg||
nt|sybarra: over drove it |pg||
mb|1D!|nt|dimi: i think 11 tricks in @s is the limit for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|dimi: 9 tricks for EW in @d|pg||
mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: with running diamonds and H AK, pity not much woth West|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *with|pg||
nt|cicus: a lot of duplicated values here for NS, can they avoid slam?|pg||
nt|caitlin: board 2 where N-S stopped in 3@D, open room 3N down 6 for 11 IMPs. only score on table thus far|pg||
nt|sybarra: and an easy 4 @H here |pg||
nt|shevek: it has been an accident in bd 11 (worth 11 imps)|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe many long days of playing contributing |pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|jtr: 1NT for me|pg||
nt|h_karluk: balanced seat|pg||
nt|h_karluk: good guess boss|pg||
nt|xenya: on 4, the Israeli NS went for a 5@D save against 4@H -- phantom in theory, but fine in practice -- 9 imps to Israel|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|h_karluk: sorta biz X, shld work now|pg||
nt|jtr: Pushy double will work here|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 20 the other room used a smolen type sequence to get to game |pg||
nt|xenya: good 3@S by S -- lead directing -- just in case|pg||
nt|xenya: he is prepared to sacrifice in clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: ah, @D finesse taken there as well?|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: 2@C is catch all for game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: but maybe W would have done better if he'd just bid 3N? |pg||
nt|xenya: tough for W now i think -- may easily go wrong|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|caitlin: and then West ran his clubs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|h_karluk: ditto |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Again the 4-4 minor fit is found|pg||
nt|shevek: probably a claim at T2...|pg||
nt|dimi: yes |pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|tomi2:  somebody knows the meaning of 3@C? maybe a transfer to @D?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could test declarer |pg||
nt|rnmalik: that should have been bid. It is always better to bid vul game. |pg||
nt|friggi: sure it will|pg||
nt|friggi: but he has to play for AK in west|pg||
nt|cicus: the first sign of misfitting values, the @C cue-bid|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|shevek: we expect a claim at T2|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe trick 4 |pg||
nt|shevek: fair enough|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tomi2:  thx|pg||
nt|h_karluk: brb guys, don't miss me too much :P|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|rnmalik: nothing is working for him-bad distribution.|pg||
nt|friggi: if not he is doomed from the start|pg||
nt|sybarra: nothing breaks well for him on this hand|pg||
pc|h8|nt|caitlin: 5@H leads to slam|pg||
nt|cicus: 5%H asked S to bid slam if... if what?|pg||
nt|caitlin: and the 2@D bid by South|pg||
nt|cicus: 5@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: 5@h just invitational|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|cicus: a @D cue may have been more helpful for South to diagnose the wasted values|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|friggi: regardless he has to make a go at it:)|pg||
nt|xenya: W did well to double but for some reason E pulled|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|caitlin: yes and with very minimal hand, no extra features than South has shown, surprising 6@H|pg||
nt|dimi: no claim?|pg||
nt|sybarra: NOT ruffing low on this one |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sfoxa:  but why they stopped?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: specs are guessing -3|pg||
nt|friggi: Not far from it...|pg||
nt|sybarra: would it have helped to duck the first ht? |pg||
nt|friggi: I think so|pg||
nt|rnmalik: he is required to duck every suit and bad breaks:)|pg||
nt|friggi: never retify the count for the def i spossible - my law:)|pg||
nt|friggi: good comment|pg||
nt|friggi: if possible I would have said,...sry|pg||

pc|s6|nt|mcarroll: yes as pointed out, 3NT makes|pg||

nt|pbundy: this lead could mean an overtrick - but rather meaningless|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The concept is reported to have originated with Mr. Eric Jannersten. The idea behind the concept is to give the opener the most opportunity to make the most accurate and ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: descriptive rebid, in order to describe his holding. As a result, most of the responses are artificial in meaning.|pg||
nt|yuval10: trump lead might give declarer some difficulties, but he can still make because of 3-3 @c|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this is the problem using 1@C weak balanced - there are few information when there are overcall (and there are when you have only 11/13)|pg||
nt|mr murray: seems like passive decision by rag|pg||
nt|mr murray: partner opened the bidding and raised. |pg||
nt|mr murray: he has a 6 loser hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: E/W make a easy 5@h - it is important (in IMP competition overall) to call game, because if opps make 4@S you wil lose too much - better a little risk (5@H-1 vs 4@s-1) that a game ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: vuln for opps|pg||
nt|mr murray: e-w should not like this result|pg||
nt|chick: well they should be ashamed not to bid this, but works out for the best|pg||
nt|chick: not to bid this slam*|pg||
nt|mrdct: might be a chance for hans to get on the score board|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  yes i do think he is likely to duck as it would blow 2 tricks to go up with the king if S has a singleton as the linbe i have described suggests|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what does sequence by S show here?|pg||
nt|friggi: they are conservative|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Neither is 4@S|pg||
nt|s bech: when you know decl has a good suit with 6-8 (most likely 7) I would not choose a passive lead. |pg||

nt|mr murray: I could simpathize with dbl of 4 spades which turns out bad but pass should be out of question|pg||

nt|cuttysark: 2! = 2@H. Ouch|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes, come to think about it i think that 2@h should be natural and 2@d = 2 suiters|pg||
nt|nobbe: good board for Dialect, easy to get to high 140 should be a good score|pg||
nt|jcwla: I must head out - thanks all.|pg||
nt|yuval10: thx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as for double vs 1H....a lot of the time they break even. 1H better when what yu want is to be in your 53 heart fit. clearly better if opops get to 3N, which is far from remote|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thanks jordan:)|pg||
nt|friggi: lead issue, could take 2 first tricks in @H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hmm, never seen a one suit intrafinesse endgame before|pg||

nt|cuttysark: But 2@D is clearer under the bid: the 1@H response is often xxxx and you may want to bid hearts naturally|pg||
nt|rnmalik: appears so.|pg||
nt|yuval10: S in the OR found the only lead that make 13 tricks for declarer possible|pg||

nt|chick: so back to a very close match|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: now 4@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard to say. W is not close to max and E has mediocre hand|pg||
nt|chick: 1@D has several possible meanings, 10-16.  one of those meanings is 4+ @D and 4+ other|pg||
nt|caitlin: that is one advantage of S bidding 1NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like N has a natural @c lead now|pg||
nt|arvidsson: hard to know in the bidding who of opponents have the K of clubs, so one would know who should be declarer|pg||
nt|chick: 3@S apparently preemptive, but N goes anyway|pg||

nt|yuval10: the 1@d opening will probably take NS to 2NT|pg||
nt|ziff:  N would have liked to double for take-out :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am astonished that declarer went down in 4H|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite reasonable to play S for 2-2 @h IMO|pg||
nt|yuval10: S for singel @h rather|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure why the rush to play @s.... Martin's line would have given a 2nd chance with no risk|pg||
nt|haans: do not like that 2@S|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S no problem for n/s    e/w can save for 500 in 5@C|pg||

nt|mrdct: well judged by east|pg||
nt|chick: it may be that 2@S shows a minimum hand, too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: K of D??|pg||
nt|yuval10: now likely to matter that much here, seem like 11 tricks in 3NT |pg||
nt|marlowepi: sort of works|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: a bit wet by both sides?|pg||
nt|chick: so I predict 2@H+2 and time to make some tea :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that might be an overbod...couldnt W have 6HCP?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N had passed in 3rd seat at favorable and had already shown up with a ton of HCP. it had to be S with the @HQ|pg||
nt|chick: yes, this is the usual restricted choice situation when I am playing :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3NT or 4@H?|pg||

nt|yuval10: i don't think he should X|pg||
nt|yuval10: he doesn't want a @c lead from a bare J for instance|pg||
nt|arvidsson: one cant be sure club is the right lead, could be @D one wants|pg||
nt|yuval10: and if P has JT @c he should hope that she'll find the lead herself|pg||
nt|friggi: if that would be tha case Emma would lead @C J is that a bad lead?|pg||
nt|andyv:  play of hand far less exciting than the bidding|pg||
nt|haans: but far less rewarding|pg||
nt|mcarroll: In a contest as close as this every imp counts|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If they lead 4th highest, S knows that W has no card higher than the 8 - the good old rule of 11|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Maybe he is thinking what to switch|pg||

nt|marlowepi: sensible auction to normal spot|pg||
nt|mrdct: on 8 systems with 11+ openings will often open the west hand and the 13 count responder with a major fit will often push to game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: opening the W hand in normal systems is a matter of evluation, not system|pg||
nt|chick: at IMPs, all vulnerable invitations are forcing|pg||

nt|andyv:  will have to bid it now... well done!|pg||
nt|turnip1: 12 or 13 imp to Kamras then|pg||

pc|dK|nt|affe82: natural lead though|pg||

nt|yuval10: OR didn't ask for the Q@s, appearently S think that N has 6 @s's|pg||
nt|chick: looks that way to me, without the @HK dropping, I don't see enough tricks|pg||
nt|friggi: so what do we have here? 3NT in W-E?|pg||
mb|p|nt|awasiak: Zobaczymy pocz¹tek licytacji podobny do rozdania 6.|pg||
nt|xenya: i think the 2@H opening must be really weak for NS -- i suspect N was maximum for it |pg||
nt|chick: another "unusually normal" weak 2 bid :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2A and weak 2M may seen quite interesting for nat sys members|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: Beeing a junior I'd like to protest :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: beeing an old old (abt 30 years ago) jr hi there, gl:)|pg||
nt|affe82:  quite weak spade suite. must have been close to upgrade though.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but not vuln vs vuln i prefere to use Dbl to give a long suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: Pass? really?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: call|pg||
nt|yuval10: does Gullvi has anything to do with the word " gulligt " ? :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: but 5 @C is the contract to play|pg||
nt|chick: but I've been surprised before at what these players can pull off :)|pg||
nt|s bech: 12 tricks ?|pg||
nt|chick: skunked (slang) = never score at all|pg||
mb|1N|nt|tez: diðer masa disiplinli davranmýþ|pg||

nt|yuval10: will N enter the bidding here?|pg||
nt|yuval10: very interesting board here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1H = ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: AAQ in 9 cards in the maors is a pretty good 10 count|pg||
nt|friggi: I was joking tooooooo|pg||
nt|ziff:  4@H E/W|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'm not sure if you can make 6 due to the 3-1 @c, but 5@c as Eric said is the contract to play|pg||
nt|friggi: yes - but ..6@C is very attemting|pg||
nt|s bech: another board where slam is making|pg||
nt|affe82: small slam perhaps|pg||
nt|chick: 12 tricks in NT (with the normal diamond split)|pg||
nt|friggi: close|pg||
nt|s bech: when diamonds behave 12 makes|pg||
nt|chick: 12 off the top unless J9xx in S|pg||
nt|friggi: but 2entries in W take care of bad distribution - given N has all the @D|pg||
nt|chick: which is very unlikely when S has shown 9 cards in majors|pg||
nt|ady: n;s likely to play 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|atalok: acýk oda deklerasyonu gayet iyi|pg||
nt|tez: nie 3@c açmadý acaba?|pg||
nt|nobbe: non vul against vul I would|pg||
nt|friggi: hehheehhe|pg||
nt|yuval10: another slam here...where is Roland who said that the boards are boring?|pg||
nt|affe82: team Gullvi has now advanced and is in second place|pg||
nt|s bech: 5 clubs making on 2 finesses. 6 clubs making on 3 finesses. |pg||
mb|2H!|nt|tez: niye|pg||
nt|boomelant: prawde powiedziawszy takie rozd wygrywa sie ale tylko na kartce jako problem:)|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@H by East can't be defeated by one club ruff|pg||
nt|nobbe: always interesting when both sides have a double fit|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I favour dbl by N which might lead to 5@D rather than4@S|pg||
nt|yuval10: S can introduce the @d suit now|pg||
nt|yuval10: with 4@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: may get away once out of 10 but costly.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too much ash:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is a fine slam, one of two finesses roughly|pg||
nt|s bech: do we see 5cl-6cl now?|pg||
nt|po-s: this looks like a potential pickup in six clubs...Lead DK|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 4@h acmak benim stilim deðil|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite an interesting approach here by W|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Indeed, but a straight 4@H by E would disrupt that possibility|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@D should imply some spade fit|pg||
nt|yuval10: S would've bided anyway|pg||
nt|nobbe: wow, maximum pressure|pg||
nt|mrdct: sounds like 1@H shows @S|pg||
nt|yuval10: W will probably bid it now.... |pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: I think "Gullvi" is the surname of one of the players|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or Gilligan?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or Gulliver?|pg||
nt|friggi: right|pg||
nt|chick: board 18 another swing for skalman when they found and made the spade game|pg||
nt|friggi: sry it is more likely after S bidding|pg||
nt|mcarroll: another 6@C?|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|mlodygda83: 1nt 14-16|pg||
nt|awasiak: 1@h 10-14 z czwórki. 1@s naturalne. 1BA forsuj¹ce z trzema pikami.|pg||
nt|haans: opening 1nt 13-15 long time no see|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6 to 16 is an interesting range|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that adjective comes straight from the Commentator's Manual|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: 1@h is just the same as 1@d - usually 5c M if less than 10 points, otherwise might be 4 when canapé|pg||
nt|s bech: no. big swing for Yellow team|pg||
nt|andyv:  on @c lead, can 6@c make?|pg||
mb|p|nt|zbig1959: hm, nawet 6@c jest op³acalne, 500 :)|pg||
nt|friggi: Roland want to make slam on 21HCP|pg||
nt|friggi: wants|pg||
nt|s bech: Dont think declarer will take a direct finesse i diamonds anyway, (playing for 4-0 without cashing any high diamond)|pg||
nt|chick: a kib points out that if N has @DJ964, E has an entry problem to finesse it enough times|pg||
nt|chick: may actually have to finesse hearts for the extra entry|pg||
nt|affe82: finesse for T of @h :)|pg||
nt|affe82: piece of cake.|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: bu 3@s kuvvetli el olmalý bence..çünkü normal elle pas geçersin 3@c e|pg||
nt|tez: ortak biliyor 55 majörü|pg||
nt|atalok: belkide 6 5|pg||
nt|affe82:  playing the opening as intermediate and constructive he should be as strong as expected although maximum (hey no harm being that once in a while)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S is a little rough|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@d probably GF as according to the XY-NT|pg||
nt|chick: no, but with some careful consideration, he can still protect against Jxxx in N by playing the Q first from dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|arigun: 65 gibi birsey olmasi lazim yoksa 3@d diyerek kuvvette anlatmak mumkun|pg||
nt|nobbe: but easy double for E with KJ in @S|pg||
nt|nobbe: in last position|pg||
nt|friggi: you cant find a player in N-EU who would pass on 3 of that hands:)|pg||
nt|chick: Gullvi Hogberg, we watched her earlier |pg||
nt|friggi: right|pg||

nt|yuval10: indeed, but the contract is seemingly unbeatable|pg||
nt|yuval10: wow....|pg||
nt|chick: this will be very easy with boh @DA and @CK onside|pg||
nt|friggi: as they say in Australia...luck:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So a weak 2@D was enough to create havoc|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's what pre-empts are for|pg||
nt|chick: but of course that is not the case here, so just an interesting side comment|pg||
nt|po-s: sorry - in 5H doubled|pg||
nt|affe82: 800?|pg||
nt|s bech: 5 hearts dbl or 6 clubs?|pg||
nt|chick: NS undoubtedly know they are way down, so 6@C might be worth the gamble|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I dont think so, hasnt enough entries to set up @Ss and needs to ruff 2@Ds|pg||
nt|turnip1: no swing|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i don't see any gross distortion, just a matter of style|pg||
nt|chick: I wonder if W should really try his hearts, knowing they have 8 card fit|pg||
nt|affe82:  plays for the @d ruff?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: depends on how trumps are played|pg||
nt|chick: for those in the audience who don't know what "canape" is ... it means bidding your second-longest suit first and your longest suit second.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|awasiak: 2@d prawie dowolny forsing do koñcówki, 2@s wskazanie uk³adu 3415/3406.|pg||
nt|yuval10: ruff and play A@d and another one|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm a fan of these sorts of systems ' never played them but i love watching it and playing against it|pg||
nt|s bech: lot of pressure from N/S. what do you think about 4 sp from the N hand instead of 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: The players are once again under time pressure|pg||
nt|s bech: no , than you are down again. No vommunication between hands|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|arigun: 7'li buyuk kart :9|pg||
nt|haans: that Big Club no more|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is lmost always correct to lead the low caard from a small doubleton trump|pg||
nt|marlowepi: of course if dummy had the stiff seven of spades and no other entry the eight could win:)|pg||
nt|friggi: like that|pg||
nt|s bech: you cant get back to your hand with dummy holding stiff AK after the diamond finesse|pg||

nt|s bech: unless with a heart lead..|pg||
nt|andyv:  reasonable contract|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Even on non @C lead, @C switch after winning the @DA defeats it|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure if N should correct or not but he does have 6 good spades|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yuval10: looks like declarer can perhaps cross-ruff enough times to make his contract|pg||

nt|pbundy: give partner the king of diamonds and not the king of hearts - and west was right|pg||
nt|chick: someone should have started doubling|pg||
nt|pbundy: who?  south's king of diamonds looks useless|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: The classical joke: "So you're declarer now, South"|pg||
nt|chick: I don;t think NS will be foolish enough to bid slam on this one|pg||
nt|h_karluk: foolish?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think i'd have bid 2@h from E....trumps are not so good, and you probably have a 9-cards @h fit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: One has a feeling that declarer could have made it from there,, but he didn't|pg||
nt|chick: and 17 of that hinged on whether the opening leader held the Axx or the Kxx of one suit|pg||

nt|atalok: muhtemel egale olur bu el|pg||
nt|xenya: very tough to double here -- and it's only 1 down...|pg||
nt|chick: even without a club lead, requires finesses that you don't expect to work|pg||
nt|daman: I lead trumps|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South in open room DBL - this depending on style to play the preemptive 4@S open - |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another bad trump break, but ot too hard to handle4-0|pg||
nt|mrdct: south has described his hand already|pg||
nt|chick: that's not a very big hand to sit for a penalty double at the 2 level|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and they might not even make that:)|pg||
nt|ziff:  Another one for the rule of the Rabbi, but who would really play @HA? @S ruff would beat it, anyway|pg||
nt|yuval10: T@d lead probable|pg||

nt|mrdct: merit in passing here with the misfit but he does have the @SA|pg||
nt|mrdct: the concern is that the @h suit has no entry after the @SA is gone|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@d was weak? |pg||
nt|ady: surely e.w should have competed to 4@S|pg||

nt|vugraphzjk: Yes |pg||
nt|s bech: diamond lead, this time from N|pg||
nt|andyv:  W does have a 13 count and a 5 card major but it's so bad that there is a lot to simply passing those hands and hope to back into the auction at a later date.|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Don't think t was necessary to double - from South's point of view 4@S was unlikely to make|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 8 cards the open of 3@s is weak, because opps have the chace to find the contract and after they play knowing the distribution |pg||
nt|mr murray: bad start. must play on diamonds|pg||
nt|yuval10: funny enough he can make 7 with @c lead|pg||

nt|vugraphzjk: Time for the very last board of this 4 days of interesting bridge, and still no certain winners. As it should be!|pg||
nt|po-s: It isn´tm easy for East - being the coward we have seen...|pg||
nt|ady: Kamras have made a good comeback   |pg||
mb|2H|nt|atalok: bence sp atagýna batar|pg||

nt|friggi: intersting hands, good players as well as commentators:)|pg||
nt|po-s: with a little help from their enemies|pg||
mb|2N|an|without 3!H or 4!S|nt|snetram: Bardzo trudny do licytacji.|pg||
nt|pbundy: it would seem this is easy to beat, of course|pg||
nt|s bech: short break after this board, 15 min|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But as P-O hints a @D return breaks up the squeeze|pg||
nt|po-s: ok..|pg||
mb|p|nt|zbig1959: jak Bogusiowi uda sie pokazac K@S to po blckw mozna wylicyowaæ szlema, inne wrtaosci ³atwo sprzedawalne :)|pg||
nt|xenya: on 8, where i half expected some imps for the trailing team, they actually lost 13, when NS bid 4@S, got doubled and made it |pg||
nt|daman: here is the vugraph schedule in case you are interested    http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks and C................U.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: friendly layout, 4H making|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c prob another relay|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and to our commentators, Simon and Martin|pg||
nt|friggi: wrong line|pg||
nt|chick: Another excellent job by our superb operator, Ida Gronkvist! :)|pg||
nt|friggi: low from dummy mandatory|pg||
mb|3D|nt|funtay: buyuk bir ihtimalle|pg||

nt|peachy: and thanks George and Cornelia, pleasure")|pg||
nt|daman: lots to watch over the next several days|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: thanks everyone who joined us here in the closed room |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@C have for sure a means - and sure not the weaker hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Dangerous double - givig away the trump position|pg||
nt|chick: in this case, a balanced 11-13|pg||
mb|p|nt|mlodygda83: wygl¹da, ¿e musz¹ zagraæ, ¿eby pozostaæ w grze|pg||
nt|snetram: kluczowy jest uk³ad 6-4. Bardziej W mo¿e o tym zdecydowaæ.|pg||
nt|zbig1959: ??? 4@H do gry ????|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: zostanie 12 rozdañ - 34 impy ciê¿ko odbiæ - chocia¿ nie jest to oczywicie niemo¿liwe|pg||
nt|peachy: Thx Ida|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i agre Liz|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but J sgl in North help South !|pg||
nt|mr murray: it will be okay this time|pg||
nt|mr murray: not the best decision|pg||
nt|mr murray: great lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Lot of sweat to get 100 instead of 50 :)|pg||
nt|mr murray: yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very prudent runout...the biggest danger is that even if club king is onside, you may not have a dummy entry to hook for it|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think W has enough to support|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he has enough to cuebid|pg||
nt|yuval10: board 22 : Upmark-Cullin did well to bid 6@c, and their opps did even better to save to 6@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: hence losing only 4 imps|pg||
nt|turnip1: Might be important|pg||
nt|ady: Haglund stepped up this time|pg||
mb|4D|an|4!D|nt|ryskiel_: ostatnie rozdanie dzisiejszego dnia, dziekuje kolegom komentatorom - Zbyszkowi Bednarkowi za calodzienny trud, Aldkowi Ramerowi, Tomkowi Winiewskiemu, Maækowi Wi¹ckowi, Micha³owi ...|pg||

nt|zbig1959: 4@C chyba uzgadnia³o @H|pg||
nt|yuval10: when's the next session, Ida?|pg||
nt|yuval10: last board of this session, as Kamras is hammerin blowing Dialect away|pg||
nt|nobbe: everything going Kamras way now. Two big swings on the last 2 boards|pg||
nt|yuval10: double game-swing on board 22|pg||
nt|mrdct: west pinpointing his shape and range now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: easily|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow|pg||
nt|turnip1: He could end play East otherwise?|pg||
nt|po-s: jo det var rätt slappt|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: running the clubs will cause a little hardship for NS|pg||
nt|ziff:  Very deep position|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last board now. Thanks Ida, Martin, Gunnar and Bertil|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|ryskiel_: 19 imp to juz spory zapas dla Mr¹govii|pg||

mb|d|nt|tez: büyük abi olur diyor..|pg||
nt|atalok: 35 sayý fark nedir sayýn operator?|pg||
nt|aldek: to na razie, zegnam wszystkich|pg||
nt|tomek: czesc|pg||
nt|frajerzyna: tutaj nic juz sie nie moze stac|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: Unii zosta³a tylko szansa teoretyczna - 500 na szlema i jaki zysk w nastêpnym|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dziêki Aldku|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: ale to raczej mrzonki|pg||
nt|frajerzyna: bo jedyny potencjalny zysk moze byc dla Auguri za 6@S -1|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: to raczej bêdzie remisowe, choæ niewykluczony zyska 3 imp dla Unii, moga zagrac szlema|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: poza tym zdaje siê Auguri ma jeszcze u³amek impa?|pg||
nt|frajerzyna: ma|pg||
nt|frajerzyna: a czasem ma to znaczenie|pg||
nt|frajerzyna: z autopsji akurat wiem |pg||
nt|frajerzyna: spadam dziêkujê bardzo do zobaczenia :)|pg||
nt|turnip1: Kamras is 3 VP ahead now|pg||
nt|po-s: but HansOve dropped too many|pg||
nt|ady: normal play on diamond towardsthe queen should see this home|pg||
mb|4N|nt|marlowepi: very fuel-intensive auction. standard methods would snoe their way to 4H via 1H-2C-2H-4H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: snore|pg||
nt|rnmalik: As in the OR natural.|pg||
nt|chick: sure, but this way, they give the opponents much more info and make it a better challenge to make the contract :)|pg||
nt|chick: I'm glad to see Kamras getting back into contention.  A runaway is never as exciting to watch :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  and thank you Ida for a wonderful job.|pg||
mb|p|nt|zbig1959: teraz ju¿ musi byc K@S (raczej singl do koloru prt nie warto pokazac) |pg||
nt|mr murray: might get it 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice K@c by declarer|pg||
nt|yuval10: still looks like 1 off though|pg||
nt|s bech: 6s from W would have been a bit more exiting.|pg||
mb|5N!|nt|atalok: GÝB cýktý sallamak da zorlastý yahuu|pg||
nt|tez: koz dönerse batýyor artýk..|pg||
nt|yakop: sýrttaki as ikiliyi biliyo sen bilsen aynýsýný oynarsýn|pg||
nt|peachy: in half hour, if it is as scheduled|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: starts 2nd set at 21:45|pg||
mb|p|nt|yakop: 37 imp|pg||
nt|tez: kuzey guney için herþey kötü baþladý kötü gitti..|pg||
nt|atalok: evet 37|pg||
nt|mrdct: but at least the def know little about the east hand|pg||
nt|s bech: Cullin likes the smell of blood in the morning|pg||
nt|chick: well, if NS manage to set this, will certainly help their score a lot|pg||
mb|6C!|nt|vugraphzhd: 24-6|pg||
nt|atalok: erkel takýmýný 1 ciligi icin kutluyoruzzzzzzzzz|pg||
nt|tez: @h as yerine baþka asý olsa 6 için ümit vardý bence|pg||
nt|mr murray: now 2 for sure|pg||
nt|yuval10: thanks and Layla Tov to our talented operator Ida Gronkvist from Orebro, Sweden|pg||
nt|fabsayc: would be nice to know what they have shown, still upmark has a 50-50 chance to get this right|pg||
mb|p|nt|snetram: 4@H - nie jest absurdem skoro 3@H by³o GF z 5-5. Iloæ asów jest zbyt du¿a na nagat.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe reduced by the double|pg||
nt|s bech: lead from s|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: E has shown a balanced hand while W recently promised a club void|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ah, south on lead, |pg||
nt|Walddk4: And he has a cunning plan|pg||
mb|7D|nt|tez: hala yapmasý zor|pg||
nt|tez: elden @d oynayabilir mi?|pg||
nt|snetram: Bogdan powinien pytac o asy, a nie cue bidowaæ|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ostatni segment zapewne za krótka chwilê siê rozpocznie|pg||
nt|bridge_one: better K at first trick here|pg||
nt|yuval10: can't understand K@c in 2nd trick|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @H7 of course to get one more trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|yakop: kozla yere gecerse zor.)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: exactly chick:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: when is the next session Ida?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: starts 21:30 local time|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: in 35 minutes that is|pg||
nt|chick: 35 minutes from now, I believe|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Second half in 20 minutes, Skalman vs Kamras|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: that lead may have cost them setting the contract|pg||
nt|friggi: see this....if low no problem but now a cl fiasko|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: zapraszam równiez kolegów komentatorów na jutro, od godz 12 wesprze nas Krzysztof Martens|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: pzed ostatnim segmentem wszystko jest otwarte w obu meczach co dla kibiców powinno byæ atrakcyjne|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mr murray: bad play|pg||
nt|chick: no "if" left now :)|pg||
mc|13|nt|cuttysark: No - best to save the king for later|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Chicken|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  >EW were pushed to 6 clubs|pg||
nt|turnip1: Yes but they landed in 5C, 4th seat 5S helped them to slam|pg||
