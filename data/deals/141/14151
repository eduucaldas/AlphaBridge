mb|p|mb|5C|an| |mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to David Beauchamp and Kieran Dyke|pg||
nt|beauch:  hi everyone|pg||
nt|woozle: Hi all from the bar at the Kingsgate in rainy NZ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@H is some kind of three card limit raise|pg||
mb|5H|nt|woozle: Gill takes an aggressive position...I like 1NT (even non-forcing) on this hand-type|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|fabsayc: 5@C either exclusion or a void jump|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|beauch:  5@C is exlusion keycard|pg||
nt|beauch:  5h have yu the queen of trumps|pg||
nt|woozle: And Gos has a rush of blood to the head, launching into Exclusion keycard...without four trumps opposite, it's a big ask to take 12 tricks...and Exclusion did nothing to identify ...|pg||
nt|woozle: the diamond holding opposite|pg||
nt|beauch:  anyway will make for loss of about 10imps|pg||
nt|woozle: 5S will probably make, but they could have no confidence on this auction that they did the right thing by stopping|pg||
nt|woozle: At the other table, Nunn did very poorly raising 4C with the worthless West hand..if he'd passed, he might have defended and beaten 3NT|pg||
pc|c7|nt|beauch:  perhaps a bit early in the day for nunn?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: right these limp raises just give opponents extra options|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|woozle: The 3C puts on some pressure, and the 4C raise takes it away|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|woozle: Someone just said that they don't like the 3C opening...I'm neutral on the subject, but I think it was working very well until West raised|pg||

nt|henryb:  Hello All|pg||
nt|henryb:  back to 17|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|sybarra: this may be first ones to one nt |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=ART, 9-13 HCP, 4+@H, maybe longer @C/@D/@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome to Al Hollander|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: another set with the "fun" systems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expect a LOT of alerts for NS system   Forcing 1@C, Transfer Openers [aka submarine]|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello All|pg||
nt|henryb:  A partscore battle, with N-S aboe to make 4@c and E-W 2@s|pg||
mb|4C|nt|henryb:  I would expect the auction to start P-P-1@s-some bid showing @h& a minor |pg||
nt|henryb:  wrond again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=NF, ART, 8-11 HCP, 3@H  [maybe min, 4@H]|pg||
nt|sybarra: al,  are e/w playing precision? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Shi-Hou are playing Precision -- i was just typing that Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: for those watching,  this will be a lot of artificial bidding,  |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi everyone welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both pairs at other table also playing Precision variant|pg||
nt|sybarra: only used with experienced partnerships and 400 pages of system notes|pg||
nt|henryb:  The Australian pair clearly do not play strong club|pg||
nt|rodal f: N for the first take out.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ok maybe only 385 pages|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards -- and some supplementary notes - online under http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Open.aspx|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all:)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sybarra: might N sit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is he bidding  1 nt |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this seems rather high|pg||
nt|rodal f: Teyssier was cold:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: must say I am not a fan of sitting at imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  clearly 1N was forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid's 2@D bid doesn't seem to fit the explanation I gave -- but i got if from their notes |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|rv: Hi all, gm from sunny bangalore in South India|pg||
nt|rodal f: The web page for the turney: http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Rodal|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|janm: EW will probably end in 4@s on this one, and should make it unless NS get 2 club ruffs - I guess 5@c is actually better, let's see if West will show his club support to get there|pg||
nt|janm: This auction might get them to 3NT, which would not be a success|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Open Room starts play with board  29 -- so they will see results from us|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure who do bet on here,  defense if @H start I think|pg||
pc|h4|nt|henryb:  the two-step probably shows constructive values|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mwigor: hi all|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like a save v 5@H|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we can only peek at their [and any other vugraph table] using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
pc|s5|nt|henryb:  We do not have an auction, but at the other table West over reached to 4@s and caught a vey bad dummy|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Hyper-agressive bidding by the NZ  north-south in the other room propelled the auction very high, very quick|pg||
pc|s6|nt|janm: Perhaps if W bid 3@c here, E might retreat to 5@c, but West decided his suit was good enough to play in, and with the @h A lead, he'll be right, I think|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this match is 1st China-Taipei vs 5th Japan|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kiwi_joker: ..and in the end they got the outcome they wanted (opps made the last mistake!)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|barnets: @DK|pg||
pc|d7|nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
pc|dK|nt|barnets: may have worked|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: likely 300 for NS -- i'd feel good bringing that score back to the table|pg||
nt|barnets: as if east had rufffed with the 9 dec would crash the spade honours|pg||
pc|s7|nt|henryb:  Nasty breaks on this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is the 1st of 12 matches for Round Robin  2 -- results aren't posted yet from RR1, but the rotation for RR2 is based upon final tally|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pelu: 1nt had been a nice contract - but prob forcing - but even then I would have passed in S (pd is a passed hand)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|henryb:  I do not know why East wanted a club; a heart would have been more useful|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: results site is http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Juniors are playing this in 4@CN|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: welcome Frank|pg||
nt|frankaus: part score battles are worth a suprising number of imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Sorry was away from table :(  Will record a claim shortly|pg||
nt|frankaus: 6-8 for a double part score swing mounts up real quick|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 13th @H might have worked well there|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|henryb:  this will drift down one, but slowly. As I have observed before, no one ever goed dowd wuickly|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c9|nt|janm: NS have a heart, a spade and a club and EW have 5 or 6 spades (depending whether N's spade trick is taken by a ruff or not), 3 diamonds and at least 2 clubs|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kiwi_joker: dummy's diamonds an alluring target - but unreachable|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pelu: Yes 1Nt was F1 - but from a passsed hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Reid could ditch his 2nd @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect their bidding was slightly different|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all - my name is Peter Lund (Denmark) and I will try to help u in this round|pg||

mb|p|nt|woozle: His first Far East championship was 1958|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|beauch:  he hopes to make 8 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Profitable save regardless. Maybe only 300|pg||

nt|sybarra: -1 not the end of the world here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: missed opportunity, but any plus may be good on that board|pg||
nt|barnets: would hav been a nice try|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi RV:) And welcome. Long time ago.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A easy 3NT?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=11-15 HCP, a) 5+@H  b) 4441@D |pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: this tourney is played in double round robin format with no subsequent play-offs|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: can W stay in his seat |pg||
nt|sybarra: yes seems so |pg||
nt|sybarra: "stay in his seat" as in pass|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb:  6@h is a reasonable contract, needing 2-2 hearts or stiff queen|pg||
nt|henryb:  and no club ruff on lead|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Miller-Stout play precision.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: wow  last hand Chinese Taipei Juniors 4@C made 5 |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: interesting choices for Shi over 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N, trap pass, 3@C [@H raise], 2@D all seem to have merit|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe tryingn to get the @D suit in before the ht raise |pg||
nt|henryb:  with various conventions of their own, such as this 3@d bid to show a gf raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: green V red usually a go signal :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes thought he might come in  but suit is a bit tacky |pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is we are in game force sequence here|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: and protecting against opener having the 4441@D hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Hou pulled out the 4 @s card then changed his mind|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|kiwi_joker: Not sure about 4@H, as Miller still apparently had the K@S to cue|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N is probably a "serious slam try, while minor suit cues would be "courtesy"|pg||
nt|rv: yes cold, @h8 ensures a stopper and only 4-0 @d break offside can trouble this contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: i expect this will fail|pg||
nt|janm: Looks as if NS can make about 3 hearts (maybe 4) and EW can make about 3 clubs.|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have an easy partscore in clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: Basis system: NS: Precision @c and EW: 5 card major with weak and strong NT (green-red)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sybarra: needs the spade lead,   should be -1 |pg||
nt|janm: Let's see if EW can get the spade ruff to beat this. If W leads a high club, E can overtake to lead a spade back|pg||
nt|janm: But on the trump lead I think NS are going to make 4 hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D is a mystery|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|henryb:  I recently saw a study suggesting that with 4-3-3-3 opposite 4-4-3-2  you should not try for the 4-4 major suit fit|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Other room just started to bid Bd 18|pg||
nt|henryb:  Oh? I thought they went back to play 29 and 30|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: has a chance but its really tough|pg||
nt|rodal f: Safe for a try by 10 tricks now.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: now 10 tricks possibly|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: would have to magically read the club suit I think |pg||
nt|janm: So we've had two hands in a row where the best defence would be to take ruffs.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if i would have been any better off with 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: well it both sounds like they have an ace the DO NOT have |pg||
nt|barnets: i think south should x and north bid 3@C|pg||
nt|pelu: very nice contract if @Hs was running - or even 4-1|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: (imho)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kiwibridge: E figures to be short so playing 9@S there would have been a decent shot|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Nobuyuki Hayashi|pg||
pc|sK|nt|frankaus: now @C was req|pg||
nt|pelu: I see the point - but how do u know that ps has 4-4-3-2 :)?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am however convinced that it is losing bridge in general to bid game with two balanced hands and 24 HCP|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid checks to see if 2 tricks is enough to beat 6@H|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: might he be concerned spade is cashing?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Hello from Hamilton.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: @H lead is bad idea now however |pg||
pc|s5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra: Reid might have also been checking backs of cards to see if they match |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: N and E starting taking the bidding cards away before Reid had a chance to X|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told neither NS player is known for being pessimisstic -- @SA not cashing would be way beyond that description|pg||
pc|cA|nt|janm: Of course S doesn't know for certain that the spade A is onside |pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: ? 9 u have. By the @Shook u still have 9 if it loose.|pg||
nt|rv: Check this url http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/Openxtab.html for all the latest standings|pg||
nt|pelu: now 8 - but "no way" to the 9. trick|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|pelu: best play @D and try yo set up a squeeze against West|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pelu: Yes he dont want S in - but if he still not 9 tricks even with @SK right|pg||
pc|c7|nt|janm: My typing is slower than the players' play! So on to the next hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi welcome Nobuyuki, you too Roland, good luck with your move to the UK|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: anything but @Sx works  --  but i would have thought @SA and go to next hand|pg||

pc|c8|pg||
nt|pelu: wd|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pelu: pressure on N|pg||
nt|henryb:  it would be nice to stop in 1NT,  -- oh oh, North just gave the contract|pg||
nt|pelu: and N just discard the wrong card: @s2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pelu: for sure not @h9|pg||

nt|sybarra: but alas a push|pg||
nt|janm: It will be interesting to see whether the other room manages to get the ruffs to beat either of these first two contracts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NZ Juniors also in 12@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 1@H-(2@C)-3@C|pg||
nt|barnets: trick here is to stay out of slam|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w have every point in the deck except @CAK|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Teramoto is much younger, about 20 years.|pg||
nt|rv: Chinese Taipei, Indonesia, Aus and China are occupying top 4 slots|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|janm: I confess I'd also open 2@s with the S hand - everything is right - vulnerability, position, spades being the highest suit|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Ino won the senior teams in Bejing.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice to have RV here. All info comes:) Local time here is 0530 but free today:)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|janm: Of course now that 2@s has been alerted, it probably showed 5 spades and a 4 or 5 card minor, so wasn't even wrong on suit length, but I think it would be right to open it even if ...|pg||
nt|janm: it was just a weak 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same 1@H explanation as last board|pg||
nt|npcjpn: This year, he plays in open.|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: a heavy 2N|pg||
nt|barnets: with 22 hcp and good 5 card suit|pg||
nt|barnets: n./s would be s well to bid 7N as 6 |pg||
nt|barnets: 13  tricks without club lead|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: ok now can e/w find and make slam? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: notes say Newell has 6@S --- i believe the notes|pg||
nt|sybarra: or can they really make 6 @D without help?|pg||
nt|henryb:  we changed boards all of a sudden|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: east is marginal for a 4N raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @C looks like "single suited"  |pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is W can tell which suit |pg||
nt|frankaus: sys on  here is normal these days with X replacing 21C|pg||
nt|janm: N probably has a good idea that his partner's second suit is clubs and so won't be useful, but it's certainly possible to envision game anyway.|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT on @dQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  2N clearly a @s raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: yes and systems on= transfer in this case |pg||
nt|ahollan1: interference will slow down EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: with bidding opps suits |pg||
nt|rv: Hi Barnet and all specs|pg||
nt|barnets: hi|pg||
nt|rv: it is 9 AM IST here in India which is 4.30 hrs ahead of London time at this time of the year.|pg||
nt|pelu: A problem for E - this bidding could in precision be on 11+5|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: hard to believe both red suits behaving favorably -- and will probably misguess both Qs anyway|pg||
pc|dA|nt|frankaus: olmost certainly its @H now that S trans to @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: and wrong colors to be stepping in with 3 @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry with 3 @C I meant|pg||
pc|d2|nt|janm: I don't know what options he had to invite over the DBL (surely 3@s was not invitational). I think S is going to come to 10 tricks, and he'd probably have accepted most ...|pg||
nt|janm: invitations, with maximum values and good spots in both suits|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks to be a playable spot |pg||
nt|friggi: sure it does|pg||
nt|sybarra: actually 3 nt will work for e/w |pg||
nt|rv: my apologies for the delay, signing in from sunny Bangalore in South India|pg||
nt|barnets: i thnk north will lead a @H|pg||
nt|rv: after 6@d, can North consider an attacking lead?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not much to the play here worst he can lose 3@S 1@D|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pelu: same strat as the bidding in Board 1|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@d is apparently a transfer|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now makes many|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 10 tricks, next board.|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@c is a non-standard rebid -- and since I do not have the CC handy, I cannot tell you what it shows|pg||
pc|c5|nt|henryb:  but this time I think S whould bid 2N|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|frankaus: welcome fridrik|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: yes :)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|sybarra: hi Fridrik :)  welcome|pg||
nt|friggi: Hi Syirley|pg||
nt|janm: Miller knows  that the DBL was a little light, so expects W to have only one spade, and takes the spade finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: some kibber (or you Al)  I am still triying to figure out if e/w can handle 6 @D|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|frankaus: 5 imps to NS here|pg||
nt|barnets: dec has not spades from 6@D bid|pg||
nt|rv: if opps don't have source of tricks and just enough values it pays to passive, after 6@h there was a chance for North to consider @c lead|pg||
nt|rv: N-S are close to making 10 tricks in @h strain|pg||
pc|c7|nt|henryb:  ah. I misread the opening bid: a strong club, and 2N probably 11-13 with no 5 card major|pg||
pc|s2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah -- stop thinking about that when realize not biddable|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|friggi: sorry shirley|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
nt|barnets: dummy did not check for majors|pg||
nt|rv: after 6@d|pg||
nt|barnets: er must have 5 spades|pg||

pc|h3|nt|sybarra: what would you do differently? |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|d4|nt|janm: I'm still predicting 10 tricks, although I'm not sure exactly how the play will go - probably will lead up to the diamonds when he finds out the clubs aren't coming in|pg||

nt|henryb:  I do not, but it is playable in a sound opening bid structure|pg||
nt|npcjpn: But some player believes not claiming in order to see defensive methods.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: first slam of the match|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: ye sbut regardless, why give it away without fightingÐ|pg||
nt|friggi: ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this looks precision-ish |pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT is likely here|pg||
nt|cascade: does this meet your standard for 2NT Jan?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does not meet my standard, but i might do it anyway|pg||
mb|1C|nt|friggi: sure it is|pg||
nt|janm: I probably wouldn't do it vul, but it's certainly close - I can't imagine bidding anything except 2NT or P|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c will be invitational with hearts|pg||
nt|janm: Presumably 3@c shows some sort of heart raise|pg||
nt|cascade: and Miller finds himself with a surprisingly good hand for all of the bidding so far|pg||
nt|janm: Everyone has different approaches to Unusual, but as far as I know everyone plays that the cue bids show partner's suit and the 4th suit (although some of us use one and some the ...|pg||
nt|janm: other for those meanings)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, STR, F1, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: may be too hard to find|pg||
nt|rv: French Polynesia is doing a lot better than New Caledonia in this tourney|pg||
mb|1H|nt|cascade: yes there are various ways|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure about 4@C|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, especially with partner bidding 2NT vulnerable, Miller must wonder if his side has a game|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c tied to hearts and 3@d tied to spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a transfer over the transfer|pg||
nt|npcjpn: looks like Michaels.|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: and it is precision  (just not sure which variety) |pg||
nt|frankaus: communications wont be easy |pg||
nt|cascade: personally i play the lower cue agrees partner's suit and the higher is the other suit|pg||
nt|janm: As it is, it's pretty unlucky that 4@c goes down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=FG, 8+ HCP, 5+@D|pg||
nt|npcjpn: dbl = 3-card support?|pg||
nt|henryb:  the black kings are well placed foe N-S|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@H = @s - and 7+|pg||
mb|3H|nt|pelu: Nt for NS = 12-15|pg||
mb|3S|nt|friggi: but np for 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is not why i am not sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry wrong cc|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=FG, 10+ HCP, 3+ CNTRL [A=2, K=1], 1-suit, 6+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H RELAY|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have good save in 5@C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2nd suit or repeating the transfer?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: i bet second suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@H=7@D 0@C 33  [or (23)80, 2290]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just what Newell wanted to hear :(|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are those 15HP wourth 1NT?  Ok. I use to do the same:)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|friggi: transfer|pg||
nt|sybarra: the good news is E (or W) will have to lead something |pg||
nt|friggi: thne 3H then 3NT|pg||
nt|friggi: dbl tr|pg||
nt|frankaus: first 9 is on top then it gets difficult|pg||
nt|friggi: 3NT is cold|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it might get you way too high and also misdirect the lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not agree with 3N: I think that should show tricks, and 2N should show 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|henryb:  that assumes you open 1N with all balanced 15-17|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT here is 6-10, so Why bid 2NT?|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is the only lead to beat 6N|pg||
nt|pelu: No they play 11-14 NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell has extra King for his 1st seat 1@C -- but can't imagine anything other than 3N now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N is discouraging, but since Reid unlimited it is not pure signoff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Liu still has chance to splinter|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: EW have ended in 5@H on  18|pg||
nt|rv: FP is lying 8th and NC is lying 13th out of 13 teams with 3/4th of tourney over|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@s easy slam to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good afternoon from partly cloudy vancouver|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: nice of @D's to break |pg||
nt|barnets: but never bid|pg||
nt|barnets: only -200|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@S0single and force til min 4@H|pg||
nt|rv: I might have opened 1@d and rebid 1n with north hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: Jan tells me she plays the cues the exact opposite way to me|pg||
nt|cascade: the most important thing is that you have an agreement with your partner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 3c for hearts, 3d for spades is the most common|pg||
nt|janm: This time we have a game where the declaring side will need ruffs (diamonds) to make it, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S asks controls   A=2 K=1|pg||
nt|rv: North could have chanced 3@c with enough distribution though suit is not good at these colors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: slam chances looking rather slim|pg||
nt|npcjpn: yes, that's I am afraid of.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he's done it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Chung now has a Powerhouse|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: twin 50's on 18 to Japan for 3 imps|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 4@s, just splinter? or exclusion RKCB?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cascade: and the defense have ruffs to beat it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N=3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so the hand with void gets to declare?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: contemplating 5@C opposite @SK and @HA?|pg||
nt|barnets: he also may have tried 3@C over 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 2@h alerted|pg||
pc|h8|nt|janm: Although if he takes the club finesse he's been offered (right you are that the club bid got them off to the wrong lead), he can pitch the diamond losers and then just needs to ...|pg||
nt|janm: avoid a spade ruff (or S needs to figure things out and give his partner one, which may be hard)|pg||
nt|janm: So that will be a third hand that could have been defeated by a defensive ruff |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if so then pass =3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|frankaus: a not so obvious @D lead/switch can couse lots of communications problems|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead gets a bit messy |pg||
nt|rv: West opening is post-modern, I like his raise to 2@s with 3 card fit instead of 2@d|pg||
nt|pelu: Wellcome to Martin Johnson from Canada|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|friggi: no problem. play for @D 3-3 |pg||
nt|pelu: so 2Nt would be 16-17 (18)|pg||
nt|rv: all of us like to upgrade the hand more often than downgrade, here North hand is clear candidate to downgrade|pg||
pc|dT|nt|fabsayc: i think in new zealand would be simpler to alert natural bids|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: interesting -- could only do that because of @H10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: glad i'm not at the table -- as declarer i'd go into long tank because of too many possible lines|pg||
nt|npcjpn: nice bidding.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: should be a formality to make it now, wd|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: How may HP would u have shoved me by that sequense RV?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|henryb:  because I think you need 3N to show a very different hand: say Ax, xxx, AKQxxxx, Q|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a) @S ruff  b) @SQ @CAK float @DQ c) @SK then ...|pg||
pc|c8|nt|fabsayc: where grant showed four spades is unclear|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 rounds of bidding - just to miss a laydown slam :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: bids being explained|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in my methods north bids 2@S over the tranfer advance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so we can focus on slam bidding rather than game|pg||
pc|c6|nt|janm: Declarer going after those diamond ruffs - but that will probably make it easier for S to realize he needs his partner to have a spade ruff coming, won't it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but as he did not discard a diamond i dont see how defense can go wrong|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told: 1@S = asking bid in @s, 2@D = 5 card !, (2 top) 2@H asking in @h - 2@S no @h-control|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rodal f: Less that 15-17?|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@d ask in @d - 4@C = A x(x)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|janm: I think S has to play A and a spade here, doesn't he? |pg||
nt|cascade: he doesnt have many options|pg||
nt|cascade: he would have been better to not overruff but he didnt know that his @hK was always a winner|pg||
nt|rodal f: tan*|pg||
nt|rv: I presume South would have invited even after 1@d-1@h-1n and N-S would have reached game|pg||
nt|rodal f: than*|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: even heart heart beats it|pg||
nt|janm: I don't know, it might be tempting to assume that West was doing the right thing and so it's necessary to play trumps to stop the second diamond ruff|pg||
nt|cascade: that works too|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh maybe not south will be endplayed|pg||
nt|janm: I think he can make after heart & a heart, can't he - lead a spade to the K, which either gets him to dummy or endplays S|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: as long as club ace still in dummy|pg||
nt|janm: If N leads a club now, declarer has to ruff, not win the A, which may not be clear|pg||
nt|rv: With West hand, I prefer to rebid 2@d and subsequently bid 2@s or 3@s with extras (14+)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|pelu: tx Al|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this leaves a whole lot of strength issues in doubt|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|cascade: a heart gets him home|pg||
nt|pelu: u also need 2NT to show 16-17|pg||
pc|d2|nt|friggi: wrong line|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont like that a ballanced 16 HCP-hand take command|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|frankaus: trouble brewing|pg||
nt|henryb:  now declarer should draw trump and play a @d to the 9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north hand too flat and too minimum for asking bids to be effective|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: he had to overtake|pg||
nt|cascade: if he guesses the spade|pg||
nt|janm: No, maybe that won't work - on a clulb at this point, he can ruff, but then has to cross to the heart J and won't have a way back to his hand. But on this return, he can ruff the ...|pg||
nt|janm: low club to pull trump - oops, |pg||
pc|s2|nt|friggi: let opps play H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is a cute hand|pg||

nt|fabsayc: either that or initial control responses of some kind|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: or 13-15|pg||

nt|barnets: north has a super max and 4@S will make|pg||

nt|janm: have been able to overtake the heart J)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 4@S by E has chances but the bad break should scuttle it|pg||
nt|pelu: no - I am old Acol-player, so distribution forst - that can improve a hand - and then cue/asking|pg||
mb|d|nt|friggi: @C lead not enough|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you ever super accept with weaker nts?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont play them, so just asking |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was just going to say that Newell COULD have bid 3@H as SSGT super-accept  [short suit game try]|pg||
nt|sybarra: for an older person such as me,  I would have to do too much "re-thnking" of system |pg||
nt|henryb:  Is 2@d a transfer or an amorphous force?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@S ok by 100% hit by the guesses. Might 3NT is better. But....|pg||

mb|4S|nt|janm: Can't tell from the auction, can we? 1@c was alerted, as was 1@d. I'd have said we still didn't know from the alert to 1@c, but probably now it was a strong club and negative ...|pg||
nt|janm: diamond - still not certain|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am told precision|pg||
nt|janm: And what was 2@c by East?|pg||
nt|henryb:  West now emerges with 3N?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i started old -- thinking systems has helped me regress|pg||
nt|sybarra: One Kib suggested bidding  3@H over 2@H (4 crd support, xx in @H)|pg||
nt|barnets: so n/s miss a decent game patly as a rsult|pg||
nt|rv: South chose to pass 2@c and subsequently 2@h since he suspected misfit|pg||
nt|rv: at MPs, many of us would act with South hand|pg||
nt|barnets: cant see why south did not bid 2@S|pg||
mb|5H|nt|kiwi_joker: the latter i believe|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: After a strong club and negative diamond, I'd have thought 2@c would be natural|pg||

nt|fabsayc: is one 10 in hearts from a decent game|pg||
pc|h3|nt|friggi: that is nice:)|pg||
nt|janm: The bidding is more interesting than the play on this hand. It's out of our "ruffs to beat" set of hands, just a boring 10 top tricks, 3 losers |pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: playing J to see if he can get accurate count |pg||

nt|friggi: then|pg||
nt|janm: I'm told that 2@c showed either diamonds or the Majors|pg||
nt|rv: declarer can still mis-guess all suits, generally trump lead is worthwhile if 1 hand is known to be very strong|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rv: if South doubles 2@C and subsequently bids 2@S it is likely to be forcing, passing 2@c and bidding 2@s should be NF|pg||

nt|sybarra: and I think S put his queen of hts in his pocket, even without the @H bid by W |pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  I would bid 4|pg||
nt|rv: have the rains stopped in South Island?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: bidding it more of a challenge now |pg||
nt|friggi: not good bid at all|pg||
nt|janm: New Zealand's IMPs came from board 2, where EW were allowed to play in 4@c and didn't make it (so that was a chance for a Hong Kong pickup if they'd gotten the spade ruff to beat ...|pg||
nt|janm: 4@h)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, STR, F1, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL|pg||
nt|rv: 2@c is possibly single suiter here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|janm: The Hong Kong IMPs are from board 3, where the HK N bid game over his partner's 2@s opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it gets stronger in 3rd/4th|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N makes for 600 against 2@DX for 500|pg||
mb|d|nt|friggi: 3@D helps opps more the p|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL=6-9 HCP|pg||
nt|pelu: partscore hand in @s or @h|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|sybarra: and E  does not have a good cue here   qx of @H's not easy |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh good E bid 5 @C |pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: right|pg||
nt|henryb:  So did East: 4@d shows a good 4@s.|pg||
nt|pelu: also my bid - the hand is too weak to 4@D (namyats)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C takes them out of relay mode -- i think|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: meanwhile closed room seems to have gone to sleep|pg||
mb|3C|nt|henryb:  I think Namyats should be a better hand than that|pg||
nt|pelu: CC: just a solid suit - but I agree with u|pg||
nt|pelu: and not "solid" :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  My rules (back when I played it) was no 3-loser suit, and not two suits with two fast losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe DBL is relay -- i'm just not sure :(|pg||
nt|rv: at any other colors, West will gleefully doube 2@d, he is likely to bid 3n at these colors|pg||
nt|pelu: Grant like to bid - but he has no bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: is this a slam that is biddable?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is very possible that 3@H=exact shape|pg||
nt|rodal f: The lead at match and team is? not @C but thrumph.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the all seasons double comes to his rescue|pg||
nt|pelu: a slow X = pd my distribution is not OK :)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 3 @D bid not recommended at home |pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe only at home LOL|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|friggi: helps W to count that hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe "we" are on our way |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so YES Shirley|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: 3@s presumably Smolen, showing a game force with 4 spades and 5 hearts, so that partner can play the hand in hearts; they know they don't have an 8 card fit in spades already|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what to lead|pg||
nt|janm: 3NT is going to be very difficult to make here|pg||
nt|rv: E-W playing negative doubles and forcing pass till 2n after double by West to set up forcing auction|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Kaz Yamada|pg||
nt|npcjpn: now the lead is very important.|pg||
nt|rodal f: How many have missed how many times there:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: what do you lead from Miller's hand knowing that declarer is probably 4=3 in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 Key Cards + @HQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: but when I bid these,  hts are always 4/1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lucky -- mine 5-0|pg||
nt|ahollan1: AND @S king offside|pg||
nt|kaz08833: hi all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we are toungue in cheek with our comments, folks|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: LOL |pg||
nt|barnets: can south be stopped from scoring a second club trick ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Kaz welcome|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: i might lead spades as the least destructive|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rv: I like this treatment as well, prefer positive doubles if we have bid a 4+ card suit naturally and on a similar forcing auction|pg||
nt|npcjpn: nice lead.|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|rv: East-West should time such defenses very well, need to combine punching declarer and remove his trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: if e/w tap dec he will make 4 @D tricks and a club|pg||
nt|pelu: why didn't S bid 3@D ?|pg||
nt|pelu: ven here its a make|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: pity the trumps dont break (just a joke) |pg||
nt|sybarra: yep k off,  I will let you play the 5/0 breaks, and count my blessings|pg||
nt|rodal f: But always 110EW|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|janm: Hard to know what to lead, I agree; although leading a 5 card suit is often right, when it's a bad suit and dummy has 4 of them... So I think he's probably right to try to find ...|pg||
nt|janm: partner's suit, just unlucky that he chose the wrong minor|pg||
nt|barnets: if they dont tap he makes 3@D tricks and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|rv: b|pg||
nt|rodal f: y better|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this seems to need 3-2 trump and nothing awful in @S|pg||
nt|kaz08833: it will go down 3 at least if E misguesss d|pg||
pc|d4|nt|henryb:  He can make this, I think. @h to Q, @d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Great Shuffler on declarer's side this hand|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|rodal f: @SJ and|pg||
nt|rv: strange play by both West and North|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might vug maded wrong at the @S. |pg||
nt|rv: low @h from dummy could even lead to 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|rodal f: But he/she will come with a correct result.|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|gambit: cl already 6 or 7|pg||
nt|rv: min of 9 tricks for E-W|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: big think|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pelu: DD u can make 4@S by playing @D in trick 2 - but then u need to see all 52 cards|pg||
pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: if you can rely on double promising hearts he made the normal bid|pg||
pc|s2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|sybarra: one sigh of relief so far |pg||
pc|d3|pc|h4|nt|rv: here even double dummy, South can't be stopped from making 5 tricks as rightly pointed by Barnet|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pg||
nt|sybarra: hold breath now for spade |pg||
nt|ahollan1: NZ has won imps on every board so far -- this another likely swing|pg||
nt|sybarra: (that is spades breaking favorably) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: well -- wouldn't be surprised if swing, but 'likely' is an overbid|pg||
nt|sybarra: China seems to be pushing very hard at other table |pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|janm: So 3NT will make - it was important to lead clubs, not to start setting up N's 5-card suit, but to take the entry out of dummy|pg||
nt|rv: now 4 down|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: should be -2 now|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it sort of shows hearts and clubs actually|pg||
nt|fabsayc: since with hearts and diamonds you act over 1@S|pg||

nt|pelu: or 2-3-3-5|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but defense does not have enough tricks then|pg||
nt|janm: Declarer has 2 spades, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds (if he uses the club and heart aces for diamond finesses), 1 club, he really can't find 2 more tricks, can he?|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: ehaa......for the S bid |pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  2-8 HCP  --  i should copy/paste instead of trying to use recall|pg||

mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: not sure|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: nice 4@S for the NZers here (even 3NT makes)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: battle of spades and hts, |pg||
nt|barnets: 3N and 4@S both make here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: and 4 @H's always "transfers" to 4 @S (for opps) |pg||
nt|cascade: i just checked double dummy and GIB thinks Miller needed to find the @c8 to defeat 3NT|pg||
nt|janm: Defense might get endplayed out of one trick, but 2? Hard to tell. And of course it isn't easy to lead the club Q either, just easier than leading low|pg||
nt|janm: But GIB lets declarer play double dummy too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EHAA was never this creative|pg||
nt|kaz08833: 9 tricks plaing \s by NS, 8 tricks playing \D by EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: 2@s seems a gross under-bid here|pg||

pc|s7|nt|janm: Ah, here we see science in action (not!)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well if 2s is minimum is quite reasonable|pg||
nt|sybarra: I only played it in midnight swisses|pg||
nt|barnets: you put the hex on australia|pg||
nt|rv: interesting contract to play and defend, I expect defense to prevail here|pg||
nt|rodal f: -1 and next? but normal bidding.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cascade: 2@s will be minimum|pg||
nt|janm: They got to the right spot of course, but does N really know that his partner can't have enough for 7? Make the diamond Q the club Q for instance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might gain by not helping defense to lead|pg||
nt|cascade: i am pretty sure they dont play 2/1 FG|pg||
nt|fabsayc: remember is precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry there is no commentary here|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: so 2s is definitely limited|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 3@s is not invitational, so pass looks automatic.|pg||
nt|rv: @h ruff or 2@s tricks in addition to 2 tricks each in @hs and @cs|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|rv: with 5@s and super-max for passed hand, I would have started with 2@h with West hand|pg||
nt|rv: lol|pg||
nt|barnets: as they miss a good game especially on th e bidding|pg||
pc|h4|nt|janm: Even if 2/1 isn't FG, couldn't he at least bid 2@c and then blackwood and tell his partner they had all the keycards and adequate trumps - S would know that AQx of clubs was golden|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@H=ART, 9-13 HCP, 4+@S, 0-3@H, maybe longer @C/@D|pg||
nt|kaz08833: its highly likely NS will play 2NT which will go down|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N must pass surely|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 3rd bidding box landed on the floor in this session|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rv: I like 4@s here, max pre-emptive effect and tough for NS to get in|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Looks like each side can make 11 tricks in their best fit|pg||
nt|pelu: here a very popular convention X pd pass if u have the suit - In my opinion the convention dont work well - u can never X for penalty if u have a good penalty pd|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Or is 6@c okay too?|pg||
nt|cascade: do they need to|pg||
nt|henryb:  North MUST bid here; pass is not acceptable with that good a hand and heart support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=ART, 5+@D|pg||
nt|barnets: not best|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D usually 2/3@D but ....|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|sybarra: but can W lead a @D easily|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6c is better|pg||
nt|pelu: ok a bidding: 4@s P P 4NT - then 5@C (or 6@C) by N and 5/6@D by S = 2 siuter in red|pg||
nt|sybarra: may not be best spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell had option to bid 3@C showing MAX with longer @C|pg||
nt|barnets: Q|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rv: South's action is surely too timid though it is hardly clearcut to bid at 5 level|pg||
nt|barnets: would show  the @HA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cascade: anyway the answer was yes easily|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@D likely down if diamonds 4-1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@C would still have chances|pg||
nt|kaz08833: with other Q N shd pass it's unfortunate judge by N|pg||
nt|rodal f: Auto @S hook and a 50% @D hook for 10in @S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps but they have bid my multi suit a few times, and i am still spending the winnings|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kiwibridge: the slam was NOT found so 13 well earned imps to CT|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: I kinda blame Stout a bit here .. he has chance to bid 3@C, which would have pushed pd's buttons (and they would never defend 5@Dx then)|pg||
nt|rv: I would pass 2@s with West hand, no Invite with 7 hcp, bid game only if partner super-accepts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i was wondering how that 3@H bid would backfire|pg||
nt|pelu: in US and ? canada - the defense against Multi is not so commen as in Europe|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|sybarra: might see china gain some imps here|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: with the opening bid,  not easily |pg||
nt|ahollan1: that brings up point of extreme trivia - i was given URL that explains origin of "schneid"  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061024124644AA8yaYF|pg||
pc|s3|nt|janm: I assume all of this was natural after 1@c and 1@d, and 3@s is some sort of attempt to find NT|pg||
nt|janm: 6NT won't be a success|pg||
nt|henryb:  Would North's pass be forcing? I do not think so. And North could have much less, say AKJxxx in clubs and out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: where do we locate BBO|pg||
nt|pelu: :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: oh is this blackwood|pg||
nt|rodal f: At the -edge for W but...|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|janm: Surely if N jumps to 6@c, S should let him play there |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would have bid 4@C over 3nt|pg||
nt|janm: I think 4NT is just a quantitative slam try, not Blackwood|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club queen has to be a big card|pg||
nt|cascade: south did well to move with no aces|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, but S seems to be thinking along NT lines, also if he bid 4@c wouldn't that make it sound as if 3@s was a cue bid?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Took it out.|pg||
nt|rv: West should surely pass 3@s after his invite|pg||
pc|s4|nt|barnets: well done|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure Herr exp a better hand by partner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have to fight everytime to play it live, mostly recently last weekend|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: i liked the unscientific auction better|pg||
nt|janm: Of course, N has a minimum and a void in partner's suit, so even with that nice 6-card suit and 3 aces, it's not unreasonable for him to pass|pg||
nt|pelu: here in denmark even "the old ladies" play Multi :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the final ruling was the event strength of the weakest team was over 8000 master points so multi allowable|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i swear this is true|pg||
nt|fabsayc: as opposed to my usual embellishments|pg||
nt|pelu: I trust u - and here we find that atitude vert strange (mild expression :))|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: big think and sigh|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cascade: Stout does have spade stoppers but the @sAK and the rest of his hand are also suitable for slam|pg||
nt|janm: This one wasn't really very scientific either :)|pg||
nt|rv: he has bid his hand to the hilt by showing 5@s and 8-9 hcp|pg||
pc|h8|pg||

nt|ahollan1: final scores for Round Robin  1 are posted -- http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/Openxtab.html|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: By non vul u are so right RV. At vul I would bid 4 100 by 100 times after 3@S from pard|pg||
nt|rv: he can make this contract if he guesses everything correctly though|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2NT might a bit hard from Brison, but his pards problem.|pg||
nt|rv: needs to avoid double finesse in @s which he has successfully negotiated, next needs to play @cs twice towards dummy and then guess @d diamonds as well|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|janm: This is actually probably a hand that would be easier to bid in a natural system - N would start with 1@c and later be able to show a good hand.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: China began RR2 in 4th, NZ 7th|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grant-Ker did get to 4@H on previous hand|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|barnets: intersting on a diamond lead|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cascade: well they get to a similar situation after 1@c 1@h; 2@d 3@d ...|pg||
nt|janm: So making 5 or 6 depending on whether they cash the heart A now|pg||
nt|henryb:  in which case South might go down at the five level when the opponents were down in 4@s|pg||
nt|rv: well defended, still could be a loss since 5@d makes for NS|pg||
nt|barnets: to see if dc could make it|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|janm: Somewhat similar I suppose, but the S hand would have shown a better hand at that point and N could then bid 3@s to pattern out. I don't know, I just hear comments about how much ...|pg||
nt|janm: easier some hand would be in a strong club system so often, I can't resist when it doesn't help at all and might even hurt|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: could not afford this line|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now spade 8 setting trick|pg||
nt|pelu: well played - but the informativ X help|pg||
nt|fabsayc: needed to cross ruff to shorten his trumps|pg||
nt|pelu: no setting trick, @C ruff (@s3), @D to King, @C-ruff @DA and @D last trick on @SJ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: of your right he still has time|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||

nt|janm: The reason I think the strong club might hurt on this hand is more psychological than real - N starts out thinking he has a minimum and doesn't revise that idea|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the vague 3s and 4nt did them in|pg||
nt|janm: Another void opposite partner's long Major!|pg||
nt|cascade: he is minimum until he finds a fit|pg||
nt|cascade: then he has a very slam suitable hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: My guess is N/S feel good about their game, but not as good as it  will score up |pg||
nt|rodal f: So after the board: That was not as I would have done it. If E goes dow. And WD if home:)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rv: on @d lead, declarer pitches a @h, draws a round of trumps and plays a @c out|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: wow - some interesting deals today|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 3@H-4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: is 2@c right bid? is strong hand transferring here?|pg||

mb|5C|nt|janm: I think you're about to get the prediction prize for the match!|pg||

nt|vugraphzkt: v late alert 1@h|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  apparently E-W play a variable NT; weak nv and sound(er) vul|pg||
nt|babs59: Hi.  Please don't jinx them Barnet|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: 10 and next|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 tricks in 1@H - so not so bad|pg||

nt|rv: ah this makes more sense|pg||
nt|kaz08833: NS only have to take 6 tricks or even 7 because EW can make 4@s|pg||

nt|pelu: 500/430|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kind of like paying to see the hidden cards in poker|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cascade: but i typically bid the six card suit unless there is a major disparity in the suit strength|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually defense could slip and allow down 1|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|sybarra: n/s system should not be tried for novices....  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and isn't even almost allowed in ACBL|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I do not know a defense to it|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe defense is just bid your longest suit |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Hou is examining the system card|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the "down unders"  (Aus and NZ) have always been "creative"  |pg||
nt|pelu: yes - not my style - but on the other hand - I dont like to see a long relay-bidding by opp|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|rv: this should get beaten|pg||
nt|babs59: of course, I've just noticed his name showing as Paul Gill, but it's Peter Gill, and he's my brother|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: probably thinking S lead from kxxx|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe he should duck the @D|pg||
nt|barnets: another @D|pg||
nt|barnets: knocks out the ace|pg||
nt|rv: yes that would be a good deceptive play especially at trick 1|pg||
nt|barnets: and if east plays a third @D dec is home|pg||
nt|barnets: and in the newspaper too|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cascade: Michael Lawrence had some advice for 6=4s which i read many years ago|pg||
nt|janm: I think it's automatic to rebid the 6 card major with a relatively weak hand, but I've been told that's old fashioned :). Glad to hear some support|pg||
pc|d4|nt|henryb:  Not the Acol I know. that is weak throughout|pg||
nt|rv: has a very good chance of working especially if West returns @D3 which may be difficult to read|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome to Pat Anderson, USA|pg||
nt|fifee: ty Shirley :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not enough trumps to take the rest|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: does that mean in NZ i'd be a morning person?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cascade: his advice was with 6=4 rebid the suit with the most high card points|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe |pg||
nt|babs59: board 7 where Gill and Gosney missed game, OR  West opened 1S and passed partner's 1NT response (surely forcing?)|pg||
nt|babs59: so it was a flat board|pg||
nt|rv: declarer should have possibly cashed 4@cs instead of playing 3rd @d|pg||
nt|rv: that would have forced West to make 2 pitches and he might have got it wrong|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any are long at @H it's W. Play @H for the Q|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: perish the thought|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: or an all night person?|pg||
nt|rv: now if North cashes 4@s, West will be in some discomfort|pg||
nt|rv: 4@cs|pg||
pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: here lau might have thought of not covering|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: better spot cards|pg||
nt|rv: North missed his chance|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: AJxxxx   KQ109 i rebid clubs|pg||
nt|cascade: with QJT98x i would definitely rebid my six bagger|pg||
nt|janm: Where did the second diamond loser go?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry, only made 11 tricks|pg||
nt|janm: And then what was it ruffed with?|pg||

pc|c8|pc|h7|pg||

pc|s3|nt|henryb:  Known as "chicken Acol"|pg||
nt|npcjpn: reall?|pg||
nt|kaz08833: serious misdefense by E...|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||

nt|rodal f: Didn't need that @H9 hook. Had a safe one if E had single 9-10ork@H|pg||

nt|davidstern: They may have right sided this to avoid a heart lead|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 25  China in 4@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: glaned at conv. cards, and were more than I could deal with at this time of night |pg||
nt|sybarra: *glanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've been studying newell-reid system for a while in preparation of this PABF|pg||
pc|c5|nt|babs59: but he will be representing Australia in the World Youth Series in Philadelphia in October|pg||
nt|davidstern: So 9 top tricks now 1-1-2-5|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pelu: EW play Low as come on (and even)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Roland!|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: welcome Al |pg||
nt|barnets: i am told its a double round robin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but since i dont drink coke, is ok|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d5|nt|janm: However, pushing the opponents up a level was certainly a good thing, because it looks as if 2@s will be very difficult to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: partner will only bid clubs with 5, then the support is adequate|pg||
nt|barnets: tks |pg||
nt|barnets: nick|pg||
nt|babs59: I understand that this year it's a double RR and then the leading team wins|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||
nt|janm: Your partner, maybe :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 232 VP - 223 - 218|pg||
nt|kaz08833: now 11 tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: get a new partner jan :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if i had say 2524 i would rebid 2c|pg||
nt|janm: Once upon a time, I doubled 1@d with 4441 (in that order). My partner waited until the 4 level to bid his 4 card club suit!! Taught me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so i think here double suggests some diamond length|pg||
nt|janm: I would be more likely to DBL with 2524, and certainly with 1534, but I think you're convincing me to bid 1NT|pg||

nt|henryb:  You cant take enough ruffs, so might as well play the @hQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  Indonesia currently 2nd, Chinese Taipei first|pg||
nt|babs59: however in other years this is the Zonal selection event for the Bermuda Bowl (and Venice Cup / Seniors) - in which case there are SF and Finals|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|hA|pc|c2|nt|fifee: down 2 now|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|h4|nt|janm: Best now is for N to lead a club and get his ruff |pg||
nt|cascade: but a diamond works too|pg||
nt|cascade: since declarer also needs to ruff a club|pg||
nt|janm: Interesting that a diamond will have the same good effect as the club ruff|pg||
pc|h6|nt|babs59: the Pacific Asia Bridge Federation is Zone 6|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|barnets: i like semi finals and finals|pg||
nt|babs59: however the Zone 7 countries are also members - Australia, New Zealand, French Polynesia, New Caledonia|pg||

nt|ahollan1: this is 1st match of Round Robin  2    Open is playing 2 full round robins, 13 teams so 1 sitout each|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not exactly sure what they did with the other events where not enough entries, so RR1 combined Seniors/Ladies   and  U26/U21 for better movement|pg||
nt|sybarra: j of @C and stuffs W in |pg||
nt|ahollan1: turnout and maybe team strength affected because this is NOT a year where PABF qualifies country for World Championships|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 2010 event in Philadelphia is an open event -- i.e. not country-specific|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|babs59: so in the Zonal selection years, though many of the Zone 7 countries play, the Semi Finalists are drawn from the top 4 teams, discounting ALL matches v. Zone 7 countries|pg||
pc|s2|nt|janm: I was wondering whether N would decide a ruff/sluff was best at this point, and whether it will gain a trick - I think E's spade spots are just a little too good for it to do so|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: oh well,  was easy for us to see,  not so easy at the table|pg||

nt|babs59: they are Zone 6, RV :)|pg||
nt|barnets: tks babs|pg||
nt|babs59: that's why it's beneficial for Zone 7 to compete.  We are a small zone and very isolated|pg||
nt|rodal f: To drop Q@H ain't as good as A@C in front, BUT tecnical right play. If u drop the QX@H ure home. If not back to the @C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i left the other table since i could not decipher the opening bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i must admit i did not think of this bid|pg||
nt|cascade: not sure i like it|pg||
nt|babs59: Zone 6 is what I'd tend to call 'south-east Asia'|pg||
nt|davidstern: N/S will have to avoid getting too high in spades here|pg||
nt|rodal f: No much meat at NS here. Even @C is of 4-1 = 35.5%|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: nice 4 @S for n/s here|pg||
nt|henryb:  hard for N-S to get to @c|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pelu: 5@H + 5 minor|pg||
nt|henryb:  not so hard, I guess|pg||
nt|pelu: :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|friggi: should be easy to reach|pg||
nt|cascade: but NZers like to preempt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 3+@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: but didnt S have exact count on W hand  so @C play was auto?|pg||
nt|babs59: in politically correct terms - Pacific Asia Bridge Federation :)|pg||
nt|kaz08833: what's the point is if EW can make 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: worried about time left|pg||
mb|3H|nt|pelu: here the 2-opening-style worked perfect|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Australia (3rd) are about 35 VPs ahead of NZ (6th) here in the Open competition.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: liu had a tough hand, but this is not an attempt to solve it|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: I dont play 3/2 well with no high cards LOL|pg||
nt|cascade: Stout is on the way to 4@s|pg||
nt|janm: 2@h is 5 hearts and a 4+ minor, I guess - I confess I wouldn't have made this one |pg||
nt|janm: Hopefully 3@d showed both diamonds and a minimum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N would have been 13-15 unless partnership doesn't allow 5422|pg||
nt|babs59: in 2011 the PABF will be held in Macau|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh, i thought he passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: 5-4-2-2 equal minimum - you have to have some standards|pg||
nt|henryb:  although 2@s would certainly work out just fine as a contract|pg||
nt|pelu: @c-lead - normal here - dont work - there are 5 @S-tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: that is what is commonly played|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c/@d = minimums|pg||
nt|janm: Now is 3@s forcing?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not to me|pg||
nt|cascade: and 3@h/@s = maximums with @c/@d respectively|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but then i dont open this crap|pg||
nt|cascade: lets hope not and they have discussed it|pg||
nt|janm: So Miller has shown a minimum, will he decide it's good enough to raise if 3@s isn't forcing?|pg||
nt|cascade: he does have an ace and a fit|pg||
nt|babs59: I have a suspicion that both Zone 6 and Zone 7 will use it for selection purposes for the World Championships|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: oops operator |pg||
nt|pelu: now Liu would have prefer to bid 2@s first time - but that risk pass round - do he had to X first|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzkt: sorry a bit sleepy after lunch :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|janm: Probably N could have bid 3@s over 2@h to invite in spades, so maybe this should be forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: I know I do not play their system since that is not a neg X for m |pg||
nt|sybarra: for mi|pg||
nt|rv: Double of 2@c by West is t/o and need not have extras|pg||
nt|pelu: 480|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: need some coffee or tea |pg||
nt|janm: The 2@h bid did keep EW from getting to too many hearts :)|pg||
nt|cascade: there are lots of ways to bid spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Shirley -- you mean Hou's DBL?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I would not X with that hand |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|rv: many experts play this treatment below 2M level after 1M-1N-(2X by opps)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: (or a beer) |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: negative dbl with 4+@H -- what's wrong with that?|pg||
nt|rv: double above 2M level on 1M-1N-(2/3X by opps) is still t/o with extras (15+)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: There are about 8 rounds left; it all finishes on Sunday afternoon (NZ time)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cascade: Lau was undeterred by the hearts sitting over him|pg||
nt|janm: Now, can he make this? Or rather, will he? I'm sure he can double dummy|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR - where NZ has a very strange system - they never found the @s-suit and they sold out to 5@c - NO X in board 10|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H showed spades i believe|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on board 10 open room|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|janm: Or maybe he can't if E puts the diamond K up on a lead towards dummy |pg||
nt|cascade: i think he has to lose at least one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: first off, it is only a 7 count,  pard never knows I have 5 hts.  and never knows to bid them |pg||
nt|rv: North should have surely competed to 3@c|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. As a spec told me 1-4     4-1=28.3%|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the problem was they had no idea whose hand it was|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a common problem when you open very light|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|friggi: do you agree?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can handle any minor suit rebid from partner too|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|janm: Of course N doesn't know he has spade losers, so is just trying to lose a trick in each side suit and ruff the second club loser|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cascade: Chan can Grosvenor now with the @s7|pg||
nt|pelu: EW signals: HL = odd Number|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree with that |pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: declarer knows well that the club was singleton |pg||
nt|rv: North-South pair not very experienced and probably over-awed by occasion|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Bd 24 very costly to NZ - the dreaded double game swing, when NZ allowed Aus to play in 5C in the other room ..14 IMPs out|pg||
pc|s5|nt|friggi: has to play E for @DK|pg||
nt|alchilds: right pay |pg||

nt|npcjpn: pass, double or 2@c?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: P=0-9 or less than 3 controls|pg||
mb|2S|nt|janm: I'd think Miller would want to bid 2@h to keep West from an easy 2@d bid; wonder why it took him so long?|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@d is certainly a reasonable contract: needs no @d loser or the club finesse and decent breaks|pg||
nt|babs59: Peter's bidding is very straight forward.  I managed to play a tournament with him last year - our first game together in more than 30 years!|pg||
nt|pelu: here a better overcall against 1@c - and in green|pg||
mb|3D|nt|barnets: i would x as south|pg||
nt|rv: I would have Xed from South hand|pg||
nt|babs59: we would all have doubled as South|pg||

nt|sybarra: sometimes you just have to hope for the best|pg||
nt|friggi: if dec do so % is very much in his favour|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  but their best result is to double 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Lui hesitated|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Liu|pg||
mb|5D|nt|kiwi_joker: 2H might be hearts and a minor, 3H now showing a "good" weak hand with hearts and clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: 5@d is an awfully big bid! I know he has a stiff heart, but surely his partner knows it too, since he's heard the opponents bidding|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Jeff may duck a round of spades here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Should be a easy play.|pg||
nt|pelu: small @c will defeat|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with winning heart guess|pg||
nt|pelu: the the winning lead - for declarer :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: was just going to say  not sure if Puppet :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|janm: And even though 2@c was in competition, it should show something, shouldn't it?|pg||
nt|cascade: considering he already stretched to 2@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator alerted for me!!!|pg||
nt|barnets: and all gone minus in 4@C|pg||
nt|rv: inexperience/fatigue showing in Macau's game, it happens to all if you are playing long matches and superior opposition for the first time|pg||
nt|barnets: but thats not the point|pg||
nt|babs59: I feel more like Peng is remembering his 800 - which should have been put aside the moment it happened|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: Thanks Amanda!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so no winning defense, both games depend on hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: but even on a small @C decl can have 9 tricks finding @HQ = 8 in Major|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzkt: np ... 1st time I knew what they were doing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H9 might have been Rusinow -- promising @H10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either way -- my $$$ on defense|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|pelu: bad luck for W - but with @Ds 2-2 or 3-1 4@S X = 500-800|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think he thought about ducking might have been best |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C will be very successful choice here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CAce that is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and actually -- then there are 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no @H duck because didn't want @S shift|pg||
nt|sybarra: well its the 5/3 suit |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kiwi_joker: LOL ..and gets a reward with his 8 scoring!|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rv: Macau is doing reasonably well, 8th place |pg||
pc|d6|nt|cascade: perhaps 3@d was forcing|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bravo|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kaz08833: to make 4@h E must play @s now but playing 3@h trump is reasonable|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d3|nt|janm: Surely not? after the 2@h bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@D would have been a lot better opposite at least one club|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: the winning heart play is both correct initially and on the bidding|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kiwibridge: Liu's 2@H was an underbid|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: since it handles a 4-1 break|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: If he's got 'count' in clubs from Tony, Sartaj should know to take this trick|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: we almost missed it seeing all hands -- Peter Newell found the play single dummy AT THE TABLE|pg||

nt|fabsayc: i missed that magic|pg||
nt|janm: I don't think that really made|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: it did|pg||
nt|janm: How?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: to say Newell-Reid have had a good set is quite an underbid|pg||
nt|kaz08833: dbl then 2@s or 3@h shows E's hand precisely|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however declarer should have made an overtrick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh he did so low club saves the overtrick|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: possible if defense never lead trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|alchilds: yes|pg||
nt|friggi: 2@S pass out|pg||
nt|cascade: the play showed declarer leading trumps|pg||
nt|pelu: in Board 8: taipei in 7@h - and lost @DQ - West had also open only 1@S - with a 4@S-opening more easy to find @DQ - but diff to bid 7 :)|pg||
nt|rv: traditionally Chinese Taipei and Indonesia were top teams in Zone 6, now it is very competitive with China, Japan etc making rapid strides in world bridge|pg||
mb|1D|nt|friggi: risky|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=ART, 9-13 HCP, 4+@H, maybe longer @C/@D/@S|pg||
nt|rv: China is arguably the strongest team in whole of Asia (Zone 4-BFAME, 6-Far East) now|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: This is a real blind spot by Jeff... he should just have continued @Ds ..after that good fortune in the spade suit, he had 5@Ds, 3@Ss and a club for a certain 9|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kiwibridge: 2 tricks in the play and 7 back to CT on 23|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good situation for transfer advances|pg||
mb|4S|nt|janm: Well, apparently he somehow made it and now we get to see the Precision 2@c in action|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=F1 , 4+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=a) 5@H(332)  b) 4441@S c) 2452 d) 1453|pg||
nt|barnets: multi 21D|pg||
nt|rv: some play lebensohl from North hand on 2@h by West|pg||
nt|barnets: south better not pass|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and we see them, 2@H a constructive spade raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and not wasted values here |pg||
nt|sybarra: well maybe the q of @D's|pg||
nt|friggi: right, freindly layout and lead as well|pg||
nt|cascade: a subdued Miller and Stout here should win back some IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Yes, surely he'll make at least 3 :)|pg||
nt|cascade: or rather too much aggression at the other table to wind up to 5@c|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we may play it here also |pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: now 4@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well maybe, could simply be a cue raise also|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|friggi: friendly|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well forget that statement|pg||
nt|kaz08833: i guess the score is almost tie because Japan will gain another 8 on bd 25|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same bidding so fare|pg||
pc|d3|nt|barnets: I like 4@H - 5@S|pg||
nt|pelu: best defense against 2@S is to lead @S4 - but in CR East - absolut normal - played @S A K 4 ( and stole his pds @SQ)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb:  6@s looks like a much better contract|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@S|pg||
nt|npcjpn: on this hand, NS can make 3NT, but no way to reach..|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@D was different|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H confirming 5@H along the way to showing max 1N|pg||
nt|rv: yes good auction|pg||
nt|rv: is Peng's 4N quant here?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: hopefully no one leads trumps too soon |pg||
nt|janm: I think a 3@c rebid with the N hand was what pushed them too high - it just has too much in the short suits and too many quacks|pg||
nt|babs59: the other table started with North bidding 2@H - both majors, weak|pg||
nt|pelu: almost for first time EW stepped wrong - down 200/300|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: in college we defined  Down 1 = Good Bridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- i was enrolled in college   no - i didn't go to class as often as i went to bridge table|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL  |pg||
nt|sybarra: but we made it thru right?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after a mere 16 years|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i made LM in decent time|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rodal f: Normaly trumh would been the best lead, but E want W to lead that color.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: some of us "dashed" thru faster than that,  but my father who often was nice enough to pick my up from school always knew where to find me |pg||
nt|rv: I suspect not though it could be for many other partnerships since fit is not found|pg||
nt|barnets: ok well done|pg||
nt|rv: as Barnet suggested, Peng should bid 4@h to show good @s fit, mild slam try|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rv: and his direct 4n should possibly be quant?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|barnets: try and give a ruff|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|barnets: looking at dummys diamonds|pg||
pc|c3|nt|henryb:  @h by E-W should work out well, but you had better correct that|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pelu: hi Amando undo - 61H by N|pg||
nt|pelu: Amanda|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: in OR West bid 3@d|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
mc|10|nt|barnets: only chance|pg||
nt|rv: as score stands with 1 deal to go, Aus winning match by 21-9|pg||

nt|fabsayc: they are occuring too often|pg||
nt|barnets: i think|pg||
nt|barnets: its close|pg||
nt|rv: Aus moving towards magic 25 VP mark, now leading 23-7 with wrong end of VP scale (1 more IMP to reach 24)|pg||

nt|sybarra: and our last bd of this set |pg||
nt|barnets: they like the multi|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: last board to the match now, thanks very much to Nobuyuki and Kaz for their great comments, thz Amanda on the vugraph, great job, and thx all specs for your feedback|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: join us agin tomorrow|pg||

nt|rodal f: Thx to the exelent vug operator. Well done:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: thx to out wonderful operator,   great job as always |pg||
nt|alchilds: easy|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Friggi, and Al,  and Frank and Pat, who were here earlier |pg||
nt|friggi: thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thank you. back in  a bit oveer 30 minutes- lets hope I am more awake then :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: But no easy road to get there|pg||
mb|2D|an|alert|nt|sybarra: and of course great thx to our specs, for the helpful (and sometimes humorous comments |pg||
nt|janm: Lau chose the latter course (when I'm playing that 4 of a minor is natural, I love to be able to open it)|pg||
nt|davidstern: North will make a move and South has a max perhaps they will find it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the real problem was a substandard neg double|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  another ambitious 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remaining matches for the day are posted now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: next will be Open: Australia v China Macau   Senior: Indonesia v New Zealand (Cornell)|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|janm: In the other room, East also opened 4@c but his partner judged to raise |pg||
nt|kaz08833: this one shd be push|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: ah, the hand that needs the heart shift|pg||
nt|cascade: an interesting point is that I think that dealing programs need to have published their algorithms to allay suspicion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing 2@C = weak @C + another|pg||
nt|davidstern: There you go|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|henryb:  on 24HC with no particular source of tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: still a few boards to be played and scored in the open room|pg||
nt|davidstern: So this should be 7 imps to Indonesia assuming 0-1-4-5|pg||
nt|davidstern: For ten tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: A sac at 5@C but 5@H also on|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: overtake and heart seems right|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|friggi: my guess was 3@C 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: quick shot of something then for you....(what ever that is) |pg||
mb|p|nt|alchilds: my too may go set|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, and maybe the spade 10 should suggest shifting to a heart?|pg||
nt|pelu: again the 1NT 6-12 created the problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid -- 1st DBL = PEN  2nd DBL = Takeout [i think]|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|fabsayc: this event is really too long, we have to realize how long everybody has already been playing|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Guess not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think any spade but ace is really wrong|pg||
nt|janm: Of course, they're not going to beat 4 whatever they do|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did Caledonia steel candy from the opps?:)|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|friggi: needs @H play from Dec, diff to find|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is will play @D up from hand |pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N was 13-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S shift is killer|pg||
nt|sybarra: can China make a profit here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  this one needs 3@c tricks, a reasonable shot, and either 4@h and 2@s or lots of spade tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: in normal system u would pass 2@S|pg||
nt|rv: this should make 9 tricks even with likley @s finesse|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pelu: best lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  My stomach is growling, so I will leave you. Have fun, and thanks, Peter|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: long explanations|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: we are playing last board of this match|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: see u again - here it is bedtime almost 2 O'clock in night|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: For those kibitzers who are interested in chess|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: absolutely -- i was thinking best defense 300|pg||
nt|rodal f: 22-19 after this board. Then OR left to change the result|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rv: my thanks to excellent Vu graph operator and wonderful co-commentators Barnet Shenkin and Barbara Travis|pg||
nt|babs59: and thank you RV and Barnet, for not jinxing Australia too much|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: no so maybe here a bit more excusable|pg||

nt|rv: finally to all specs for listening to us patiently|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|cascade: about 8 or 9 times i have lost count|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: maybe 500 now|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|janm: Interesting how many people are good at both games|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: there is a dealing program written by a norwegian|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which produces a lot of wild hands|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks like that program|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is used by some of the dealing equipment|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so wherever the equipment goes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and i am totally convinced the hands are not random|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the technical term is pseudo random|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in a run of say a million hands it should converge on the theoretical odds |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: romm will stay open unti scores are finalised|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H10 would have been very trusting - an maybe worthy of write-up|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting position now however |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D best|pg||
