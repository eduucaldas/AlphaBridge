nt|cuttysark: Current standings, at the half-way point after the 1st Round Robin are: England 102; England 2 81; Northern Ireland 78; Scotland 72; Ireland 68; Wales 46|pg||
nt|sybarra: well some of us will only put in comments when "approprate"   |pg||
nt|idc: OR played last hand in 4@s, so just an IMP swing|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|yo_yo: Ew play Acol with a weak NT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Results available on www.sbuwest.co.uk/SeniorCamrosehtml|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|idc: The format here is 6 teams (including England 2, the sponsor's team)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 20/20 hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: c@c a fair contract |pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: 6@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: only requires club break|pg||
mb|2S|nt|idc: They play each other twice over the weekend, two 14 board matches v each other team|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: some might have ventured in with north if system allows|pg||
nt|lestergold: not an easy one to reach tho|pg||
nt|sybarra: so how do most of play the X agst the 2 @d ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @d= lolng major is my guess |pg||
nt|lestergold: however i sense a 3N coming on|pg||
nt|lark20: Paul plays it for penalties|pg||
nt|sybarra: "dashing" into 3 nt now?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  they wont go under slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland would be dashing into 6@c|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yo_yo: i think that's a range probe|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Scotland are the holders of the Senior Camrose - I'll try to mention that a lot before tomorrow, since I doubt it will be true afterwards :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: obviously Peter doesnt mind the 2 doubletons for his NT opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: 32 points and an 8 card fit they should get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: think I will just as soon defend |pg||
nt|rednaxela: Welcome back everyone.  I suspect our operator is catching us up with events so far!|pg||
nt|lestergold: in theory that is|pg||
nt|sybarra: well that was commentators curse |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cuttysark: Patrick Jourdain is a Camrose veteran: he has won the Camrose playing for Scotland when he was here for a brief spell, but usually represents Wales|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Gareth Jones also plays Camrose for Wales, usually with son dafydd|pg||
nt|fabsayc: any actual residence requirement?|pg||
nt|idc: Well, we seem to be back|pg||
nt|idc: Welcome all to Scotland v Ireland in the 8th match of 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: for both andreas and Mike |pg||
nt|lestergold: i predcited 3N a long time ago|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cuttysark: Indeed - a 2 year residence requirement, during which time you cannot play for any other country|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: n/s do well in a diamond contract|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: 2H denies a major|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not sure why Jean wanted to know the range but I am sure the Mackenzies are pleased to know|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|idc: Our operators have managed to get the results for board 17 into the system while we had technical problems|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: brb all,   need to take neighbor to taxi  (she is invalid)   |pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i think 3nt nt is a wery weak bid from hackett if he dosent like his hand he could at least invit to slam|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|d6|nt|lestergold: well thats to bed with A@h|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|rednaxela: N/S playing a safe 3NT.  6@c would have good play on a non-diamond lead.|pg||
nt|rednaxela: This is round 8 of 10 in the Senior Camrose.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cuttysark: That is a fine lead from Price - reckons he will never establihs his own suit so may as well look for partner's|pg||

nt|lestergold: its certainly a pessimistic bid surely anything wouold be forcing how about starting with 3C?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d3|pc|c5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|idc: Ireland made a tricky 4@h in the other room on 17, so have an 8 IMP lead already|pg||
nt|lestergold: then Harper should bid 4@c and they are away|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|rednaxela: Enland are in a commanding lead in the event. The two teams on show here are separated by only 2 vps.|pg||

nt|sybarra: and a bunch of extra tricks |pg||
nt|idc: Guess it needs a @h lead and @d switch, not a defence that is possible to find|pg||
nt|lestergold: someone keeps dealing 20/20 hands|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah thanks christine, i was an operator a few weeks ago, not easy|pg||
mb|1N|nt|fabsayc: but full credit to a thoughtful lead|pg||
nt|idc: They are fine as long as there is some shape to the hands|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|2H|nt|lestergold: 4@h on for n/s|pg||
mb|2S|nt|cuttysark: Not clear that the diamonds were 5-3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so just confirming, the last hand was 2 down?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: -2|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: these are only "mildly" shapey |pg||
nt|sybarra: will W sit?|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w do no0t want to get too high here in spades|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And 6 imps to N ireland who stayed in 3@D|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@C is multi landy, showing both majors|pg||
nt|yo_yo: (not sure if that promises 5/4 )|pg||
nt|lestergold: was 2@h forcing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Everyone and their dog is playing weak major/minor 2M openings these days|pg||
mb|4H|nt|cuttysark: South opened a Multi in the other room, so North is playing 2@H|pg||
nt|idc: NS here play 15-17 NT and 5 card majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: EW are 11-14 NT and a 5 card spade suit opening|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Heart lead in the other room did not trouble declarer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what is the explanation of this auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: N in the other room did well to hold to -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: -2|pg||
nt|idc: West hand is worth something between 2.25 and 2.51 @s according to my made-up-odds system|pg||
nt|lestergold: shoud be able m to scramble 9 tricks on cross ruff ines|pg||
pc|s4|nt|idc: opposite a protective dbl it isn't quite as good|pg||
pc|s3|nt|idc: The 1NT was alerted, no doubt it is wide range, from 6-11 (no more since he is a passed hand)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|cuttysark: I suspect this double by the passed hand showed a major and a minor, or some such thing|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: south says he should have atleast 4 diamonds|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: it does look rather odd to choose the 4-2 fit rather than the 5-3 :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok, this convention perhaps should remain nameless|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: there are hazards but declarer should get out for the loss of 2 hearts and 2 spades|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Agree that 3@S is a bit optimistic|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: 15-17 NT when vulnerable|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: without 2@s by east would harper have bid 31H?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|idc: West was thinking of c!K to retain a @c entry to dummy for diamond ruffs|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: both the Welsh ladies represented Wales a few weeks ago in the Lady Milne|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The 'someone has blundered' defence to 1NT - it is becoming more popular|pg||
nt|fabsayc: meanwhile defense has had many opportunites to lead trumps|pg||
nt|idc: A @c switch (or the @sK) would have worked well there|pg||

nt|lark20: I don't think !2H was frocing and south has a very flat hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|idc: I remember meeting Michael MacDonagh when he played for Ireland in European Champonships a few years ago|pg||
mb|1H|nt|idc: He had a different partner then IIRC|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Spades plays very well for E/W|pg||

nt|yo_yo: will peter raise it?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  how strong are N/S and E/W nt?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cuttysark: Waterlow did rather well to make 10 tricks in the other room - won't like losing an imp for his pains :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: We play hardly any Board-a-match scoring in Europe, which is a pity|pg||
nt|lestergold: whatever hackett bids now they will play in spades|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|vugraphzjc: 20-22|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Ah - if it had been 19-20 they could play there, but even the 2-level looks rather high|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I'm not sure it counts as bridge but it is fun :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: most difficult form of the game (imo)|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Well, well!|pg||
nt|idc: Not a classic 1NT overcall by East but I admit to a sneaking admiration for the bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon all|pg||

mb|p|nt|idc: I suspect so; beyond me for sure|pg||

mb|p|pc|h7|nt|cuttysark: A gay leap to 5@C in the other room - unlucky to be doubled, but this is a better spot|pg||

nt|lestergold: Hi Ian|pg||
nt|lark20: Hi you are lucky!|pg||

nt|lestergold: 4@H strikes me as an appropriate shot with south's hand knowing that any club honours with north likey  to be well placed|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this feels like it should make|pg||
nt|idc: NS CC just says raises are preemptive after dbl|pg||

nt|fabsayc: this is ok too|pg||
nt|rodal f: But wich black hook after 1@H?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Decalrer has to guess which black suit to finesse - rather like an earlier hand he got wrong. |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Rather him than me|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he first has to play his queen|pg||
nt|lestergold: and they fiind the 4/4 fit|pg||

nt|rednaxela: If his partner's K@S had been the A@H he might have done the right thing.|pg||

nt|lestergold: what daylight robbery|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: well hardly balance|pg||
nt|idc: As a few specs have mentioned to me, 1@s is a better shot with the West hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: well if Baron, may alert them to the problem |pg||
pc|c2|nt|cuttysark: Wow - it is OK to open  weak NT with an 11 count, but I don't like to do ite with 4-3-3-3, particularly if partner is going to move with that South hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did they have weak 1NT openings in 42?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, was keystone of acol|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Oh yes - and even earlier|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Since North's hearts are not great he may well have an ace on the side|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cuttysark: But he will not have both aces, so it looks right to clear spades and sit back|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|idc: Looks more like a delayed game raise with a @s suit, than shortage in @d being the key feature|pg||
nt|lestergold: wrong sided but it doesnt matter with club right|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h frigid vul for ireland and they are not even in teh auction|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: imagine sitting in a musty hall at cambridge during the second world war|pg||

pc|d3|nt|lestergold: i think its Ian's mother in law at work|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cuttysark: If South decides to use Stayman - and why not, the chances of a 4-4 majors fit are quite good - she d=should bid 2@H over 2@D and hope to survive in a 4-3 fit|pg||

nt|sybarra: need to "press to the finish" here |pg||
nt|lestergold: well all these trange bidding systems so u cant show a strong hand |pg||

nt|lestergold: im no bidding theorist but i do not like to be gagged with 19 points|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjc: a major|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D is likely multi landy over nt |pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: like a 2 @D multi opening bid |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Probably the most sensible choice :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes not quite good enough for 4@H vulnerable|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now, will Moyna show here @S|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Don't think she should - too much rubbish in the minors|pg||

mb|2S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: go for it|pg||
nt|idc: That's an unusual way for it to gain: don't show your major first round, in case opponents are about to play in it|pg||
nt|idc: My partners used to like those methods - they claimed that the way I played them I never had strong hands|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: I often play multi over nt |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: it sort of goes with  multi openings |pg||
nt|lestergold: played very quickly it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: not my choice if club was a nat bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: not that any lead would threaten this contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: "nice 4 card diamond suit" says N|pg||
nt|lestergold: not with gun to my head do i bid this 2@s at unfavourable vul|pg||
nt|idc: Normal enough bidding but a low spade lead will kill this|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: and is automatic|pg||
nt|lestergold: i lioke to have more tan 2 playing tricks to bid at this vul|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|cuttysark: Anyway, This is the last board of this session. Many thanks to Sandra Claridge of Bridge Great Britain, and Michele Alexander and Peter Cohen of the West district of the Scottish ...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Bridge Union for organising the event, and to Bernard Teltscher for sponsoring it. Also to our excellent operator, Stuart Bradnam, and to my fellow commentator, Martin Johnson . |pg||
pc|h5|nt|cuttysark: And of course Frank Rodal, whose name I cannot spell correctly :)|pg||
nt|rednaxela: South's Diamonds are almost as good as North's Clubs.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And, as they have just pointed out, there ar two more to play since they started with 17|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So sorry - don't go yet, still time for Wales to make a few more inroads|pg||
nt|idc: With a chunky 5-card suit and a couple of tens, I'd stretch to a game invite over 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|idc: Well, I guess the overcall makes that less attractive|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the childrfen are sent out|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: a near certain singleton but you can afford to duck|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: not so sure about that duck however|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Should be a fair save against the vulnerable game|pg||
nt|idc: You'd expect North's spades to be lying over partner's honours there|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|rednaxela: 5 more imps to CBAI - Scotland down in game at both tables on board 24.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|cuttysark: I am wondering why North did not make a penalty double on the first round|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Perhaps he thought the hand too strong|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could have been entirely shut out if west had rebid 3s instead of 3d|pg||
nt|idc: spec makes the good point that 2@s dbld likely to be 500 - maybe East should consider passing?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|idc: I'm not sure|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: It's might OK to wait E was not limited and NS at vul. |pg||
nt|cuttysark: It is suggested that Ns may play a convention known as 'Lionel' wher dbl shows 4+spades and another suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I guess penalty doubles of the weak NT are not very frequent - but I would be reluctant to give them up!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lionel was never designed for use over weak no trump|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is not so much penalizing as distinguishing strong versus competitive bids over the weak nt|pg||
nt|cuttysark: N Ieland allowed to play 4@S doubled on the previous board, so back in the lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Williams bid 3@S on this in the other room|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he will insert the 10 surely|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||

nt|idc: Not quite sure what happened there but -1 is what we seem to have|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: -2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: slam time|pg||
nt|lestergold: pretty good slam here|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: only 19 imps a board needed for the tie|pg||
nt|idc: England hit back with two double figure swings: they bid good slam on 24 and game on 24 that NS 'stole' from the Irish here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: seems to me -1 is right given the defense, but I think n/s missed a trick |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: warming up the redouble cards|pg||
nt|idc: Thanks - at least I've proved what I said: I didn't know what was going on|pg||
nt|sybarra: right sorry -2 |pg||
nt|idc: Bd 25 the latter of those, sorry|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Ain't any easy 4@S. 3NT is better.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: note 6N by south is infrangible on any lie of thecards|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: a case for this being a passout|pg||
mb|1N|nt|idc: The Irish play 2 over 1 game forcing, so let's see how they use the extra space|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: 3NT thin but possible here|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Ian im going to leave this in ur excellent hands as i am commentated out for now|pg||
nt|idc: Bye and thanks very much for your efforts Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: bye folks|pg||
mb|3D|nt|yo_yo: no messing around :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: That's how it's done :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well he will find out the good news in @D in a minute |pg||
nt|yo_yo: and the @C finesse works|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @H  are 3-3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that adds up to a make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|idc: I prefer 2NT on 2nd round from South I think|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: lets see if W bids it  |pg||
nt|sybarra: yes he did |pg||
nt|idc: With SOuth having neither Ace for an entry, even @h lead is no good|pg||
nt|lestergold: did a wheel come off or would it be better to say that a wheel never came on!|pg||
nt|rednaxela: The difficulty is that south hasn't agreed Spades.  If 2@s showed 6 then 3@s by south might be better than 3@c.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: this one maybe too tough to find 3nt|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might do it with forcing stayman|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is feeble|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|idc: On the previous board, 2@h by E was doubled in OR, but only -1 so a flat board|pg||
nt|idc: Now I think on it, this attack on declarer's communications may be best|pg||
nt|idc: declarer has to decide how to time playing @s & @d|pg||
nt|idc: play one suit too much and perhaps defenders can continue it to set up tricks|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree. Still 3NT is better:)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|dT|nt|idc: on another layout: here one round of spades, then @d towards K, then back to @s will work|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|idc: or even 2 rounds of spades with them 4-4|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzjc: "i dont know where i found that lead from" says Simpson :)|pg||
nt|idc: @h switch declarer would have to duck, then hope for spades 4-4 when defence went back to them|pg||
nt|idc: and d!A onside: needs a lot this game|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy for sure |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cuttysark: It's going well - |pg||
pc|s6|nt|cuttysark: Pips look good enough for 4@S also, though I agree there is no defence to 3NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S2 at S and 6 or 9 at N. Pitch @Ds from N at @H? Should still be on, but...|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|nt|yo_yo: greer's looking for the 13th I bet|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cuttysark: Steen Moller points out that if North had discarded 3 diamonds he would have given declarer even greater problems|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no he wasnt|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe - but he will settle for 12, i am sure|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: this line i dont like|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you may as well cross ruff playing for spade 9 with south|pg||
nt|sybarra: is making 2 nt legit also? |pg||
nt|yo_yo: as long as he doesnt finesse the @H, he's home|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|cuttysark: can establish clubs with a ruffing finesse, but a crossruff looks simpler|pg||
pc|c8|nt|idc: The defenders have done ok so far, time to switch to clubs soon though|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cuttysark: Still, Patrick was never one for the simple line|pg||
