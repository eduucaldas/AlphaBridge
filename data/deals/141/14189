mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|sybarra: my guess is the 2 @H was 5 hts + a minor, |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|idc: Yup|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Welcome to Mike Amops, who gamely helped out earlier - hope the hands are more exciting|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Greer  for NI is playing throughout but with 2 different partners|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Here he is playing with his wife, Moyna|pg||
mb|3C|nt|yo_yo: the Hands are also a married couple|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|sybarra: welcome Mike |pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: Hi Kath|pg||
nt|vugraphzjb: yes - the actual play was somewhat slower :) |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jtr: West with nothing hoping to find partner's suit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: David Jackson captains the open team, is that correct?|pg||
nt|barnets: now was souths 1N strong or weak|pg||
nt|jtr: Not recently|pg||
nt|vugraphzjb: 14-16|pg||
nt|barnets: it looks more strong to me|pg||
nt|jtr: He used to, yes|pg||
nt|barnets: thats about right|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yo_yo: and Garvey is part of the open team?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jtr: @d lead needed to beat 6@c|pg||
nt|jtr: No  he has played on it about 17 years ago|pg||
nt|jtr: Now in the seniors for Ostend with Jackson|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|barnets: and 6N|pg||

nt|idc: @hQ I meant|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Current standings, at the half-way point after the 1st Round Robin are: England 102; England 2 81; Northern Ireland 78; Scotland 72; Ireland 68; Wales 46|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|yo_yo: Ew play Acol with a weak NT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Results available on www.sbuwest.co.uk/SeniorCamrosehtml|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: The format here is 6 teams (including England 2, the sponsor's team)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 20/20 hand|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|idc: They play each other twice over the weekend, two 14 board matches v each other team|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: some might have ventured in with north if system allows|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yo_yo: i think that's a range probe|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Scotland are the holders of the Senior Camrose - I'll try to mention that a lot before tomorrow, since I doubt it will be true afterwards :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: obviously Peter doesnt mind the 2 doubletons for his NT opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: think I will just as soon defend |pg||
nt|rednaxela: Welcome back everyone.  I suspect our operator is catching us up with events so far!|pg||
pc|s8|nt|cuttysark: Patrick Jourdain is a Camrose veteran: he has won the Camrose playing for Scotland when he was here for a brief spell, but usually represents Wales|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Gareth Jones also plays Camrose for Wales, usually with son dafydd|pg||
nt|fabsayc: any actual residence requirement?|pg||
nt|idc: Well, we seem to be back|pg||
nt|idc: Welcome all to Scotland v Ireland in the 8th match of 10|pg||
pc|s9|nt|cuttysark: Indeed - a 2 year residence requirement, during which time you cannot play for any other country|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: n/s do well in a diamond contract|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: 2H denies a major|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not sure why Jean wanted to know the range but I am sure the Mackenzies are pleased to know|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|nt|idc: Our operators have managed to get the results for board 17 into the system while we had technical problems|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|lestergold: well thats to bed with A@h|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|rednaxela: N/S playing a safe 3NT.  6@c would have good play on a non-diamond lead.|pg||
nt|rednaxela: This is round 8 of 10 in the Senior Camrose.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cuttysark: That is a fine lead from Price - reckons he will never establihs his own suit so may as well look for partner's|pg||

pc|c6|pc|h7|pc|d9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|idc: Ireland made a tricky 4@h in the other room on 17, so have an 8 IMP lead already|pg||
pc|sA|mc|12|nt|rednaxela: Enland are in a commanding lead in the event. The two teams on show here are separated by only 2 vps.|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|yo_yo: not many entries to hand here|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|barnets: Scotland could have defeated a game on board 17 one of the missed boards and that is the adverse 8 imp swing|pg||
nt|garnetts: cannot take advantage of the good @D position|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|yo_yo: give up a couple of @D and hope they split?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, West might find a @c switch|pg||
nt|garnetts: that would be devastating |pg||
nt|barnets: a club swich now would do well|pg||

nt|yo_yo: hello mike|pg||
nt|barnets: west should really have found the switch as he could envision the 7 winners with declarer knowing he had 3@Hs and 3@ds|pg||

nt|sybarra: and a bunch of extra tricks |pg||
nt|idc: Guess it needs a @h lead and @d switch, not a defence that is possible to find|pg||
nt|lestergold: someone keeps dealing 20/20 hands|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah thanks christine, i was an operator a few weeks ago, not easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but full credit to a thoughtful lead|pg||
nt|idc: They are fine as long as there is some shape to the hands|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Not clear that the diamonds were 5-3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so just confirming, the last hand was 2 down?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: -2|pg||
mb|1N!|an|6-11 pts|nt|sybarra: these are only "mildly" shapey |pg||
nt|sybarra: will W sit?|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w do no0t want to get too high here in spades|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And 6 imps to N ireland who stayed in 3@D|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@C is multi landy, showing both majors|pg||
nt|yo_yo: (not sure if that promises 5/4 )|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Everyone and their dog is playing weak major/minor 2M openings these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: South opened a Multi in the other room, so North is playing 2@H|pg||
nt|idc: NS here play 15-17 NT and 5 card majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: EW are 11-14 NT and a 5 card spade suit opening|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|cuttysark: Heart lead in the other room did not trouble declarer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what is the explanation of this auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: N in the other room did well to hold to -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: -2|pg||
nt|idc: West hand is worth something between 2.25 and 2.51 @s according to my made-up-odds system|pg||
nt|lestergold: shoud be able m to scramble 9 tricks on cross ruff ines|pg||
pc|h2|nt|idc: opposite a protective dbl it isn't quite as good|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|idc: The 1NT was alerted, no doubt it is wide range, from 6-11 (no more since he is a passed hand)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cuttysark: I suspect this double by the passed hand showed a major and a minor, or some such thing|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: south says he should have atleast 4 diamonds|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cuttysark: it does look rather odd to choose the 4-2 fit rather than the 5-3 :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok, this convention perhaps should remain nameless|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: there are hazards but declarer should get out for the loss of 2 hearts and 2 spades|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Agree that 3@S is a bit optimistic|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 15-17 NT when vulnerable|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
pc|dA|nt|idc: West was thinking of c!K to retain a @c entry to dummy for diamond ruffs|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|yo_yo: both the Welsh ladies represented Wales a few weeks ago in the Lady Milne|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|cuttysark: The 'someone has blundered' defence to 1NT - it is becoming more popular|pg||
nt|fabsayc: meanwhile defense has had many opportunites to lead trumps|pg||
nt|idc: A @c switch (or the @sK) would have worked well there|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c8|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good to see the ladies playing |pg||
nt|yo_yo: not for the english teams though :9|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or scots|pg||
nt|rednaxela: J@c would have been best.  A small one could have been ducked to East.|pg||
nt|idc: But @h was the natural continuation, though declarer now has time to set up @d|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: hm... drWING TRUMPS DOES NOT SEEM TO BE BEST HERE|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry caps lock hit|pg||
nt|idc: It may work with South having @sQ9, but agree on a lot of other layouts|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|yo_yo: or irish|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|cuttysark: England 2 playing in diamonds in both rooms - not usually a successful ploy|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: north should havwe played a club|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: home now|pg||
nt|cuttysark: One Scottish lady played last year :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|idc: Now that @h98 are set up, West just needs trump finesse & break now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: obviously no one good enough this year :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yo_yo: was that you Liz?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: That was no lady, that was ....me|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|barnets: apart from those points its perfect|pg||

nt|barnets: the the def gave up the diamond position|pg||
nt|barnets: to allow dec 3 diamond tricks|pg||

nt|idc: EW are playing 12-14 NT and N-S 14-16|pg||
nt|sybarra: *is NOT BAM|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|idc: I remember meeting Michael MacDonagh when he played for Ireland in European Champonships a few years ago|pg||
mb|1N|nt|idc: He had a different partner then IIRC|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Spades plays very well for E/W|pg||
mb|2H|mb|4S|nt|cuttysark: looks like a multi with a strong balanced option of 19-20|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 20-22|pg||
nt|yo_yo: will peter raise it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Waterlow did rather well to make 10 tricks in the other room - won't like losing an imp for his pains :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: We play hardly any Board-a-match scoring in Europe, which is a pity|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjc: 20-22|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Ah - if it had been 19-20 they could play there, but even the 2-level looks rather high|pg||
pc|hK|nt|idc: I'm not sure it counts as bridge but it is fun :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: most difficult form of the game (imo)|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Well, well!|pg||
nt|idc: Not a classic 1NT overcall by East but I admit to a sneaking admiration for the bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|lark20: better than 2@C|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Good afternoon, Mike.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|idc: I suspect so; beyond me for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Alex|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: A gay leap to 5@C in the other room - unlucky to be doubled, but this is a better spot|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not many places to go looking for tricks|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Greer gives a smith peter signal |pg||
pc|d3|nt|idc: Welcome Mike & Beryl - pull up a chair and help yourself to Alex's biscuits (so much nicer than my ones)|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Ian|pg||
nt|lark20: Hi you are lucky!|pg||
nt|rednaxela: I must admit I would be a 2@c bidder - trusting that partner would expect a decent hand from me vulnerable at the 2 level.|pg||
nt|lestergold: not sure i liked Rae's overcall of 1N|pg||
nt|idc: The @s position is favourable for declarer but just one too many losers overall|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Obviously, this would only work in the first few weeks of our partnership.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yo_yo: he likes @S|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
nt|sybarra: and now about to run home with tricks he can see |pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|yo_yo: he's good at spotting those pips :)|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|c3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hmmm|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not sure why he did that|pg||
nt|idc: since declarer lacks dummy entries to set up clubs, I guess he needs @d 3-3 with K onside now|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rednaxela: In fact Jackson, in the closed room, has just done so.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||

mb|2D|nt|cuttysark: (I mean England 2 - it is confusing, is it not?)|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|idc: South remembered his partner had passed initially, so no need for anything more than 1NT|pg||
nt|idc: Just 4-0 to NI after 4 boards: you get to decide if that is tight bridge or flathands|pg||
nt|idc: maybe a bit of both|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: second best defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmm|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: as opening lead|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Had to lead hearts to get a spade through, but no special reason why he should|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Heart lead might cost a tempo on other layouts - the 6card club suit is the killer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it might but the spade is huge favorite to blow a trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: now should mnake because of lucky position of spade J|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim switch no chance|pg||

nt|idc: Dave Gerrard did respond 1@s as recommended by Mke in OR, and may get 1 IMP for Scotland as a result|pg||
nt|lestergold: south not sure whether to win in ahnd and preserve 1CK as entry to spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: or to cash clubs and bank all on spaxde finesse|pg||
nt|idc: that's if 1NT here makes...|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie it must make now|pg||

nt|rednaxela: I'm in for 1@s.|pg||
nt|lestergold: not I|pg||
nt|idc: Perhaps that accounts for the many 4@s -2 and 3NT -3 results we used to have as a partnership Alex|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|rednaxela: I think our play had something to do with it too.|pg||

nt|yo_yo: yes but will they bid it?|pg||
nt|jtr: North maybe worth it|pg||
nt|jtr: But one gets used to having a 5-card major opposite|pg||
nt|yo_yo: after the last disaster he might not|pg||
nt|barnets: north has the values for 4@H still and should raise|pg||
nt|garnetts: If north thinks his hand is worth 4@H why not start with 1@S?  |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|barnets: with his points worth extra for position|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i wouldnt agree with 1@S|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|c8|pg||
pc|sT|nt|garnetts: Well assuming 1@S is forcing you get to know what partner has--agreed that 2NT shows values--also 4@H is fine too--but 2NT can lead to ethical problems too|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|barnets: sometimes the opps bid 4@S|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think my main point is that I do not like 2NT--as you say if you are bidding 4@H anyway then bid it|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont see what is wrong to 2NT  It shows a limit raise+|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but surely there's a different between 4@H preemptive and 4@H with values|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, you want to show that you have defensive values|pg||

nt|sybarra: imp is an imp |pg||
nt|idc: some shape at last - but still 20-20|pg||
nt|cuttysark: A guddly partscore as we say in Scotland (well we don't really) |pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|lestergold: 4@H form N/S looks makeable as cards lie|pg||
nt|idc: I wonder if NS have a bid for this sort of hand|pg||
nt|idc: Scotland -500 in that 4@h X contract in OR - they will be surprised to learn that gains they 3 IMPs|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s can make game in either major as cards lie|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: i prefer double to the 1N overcall in open room|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|lestergold: if you hear pard clubs you can bid dims showing your hand|pg||
nt|idc: I guess they don't play transfer after the dbl for example - nice to be able to show good raise|pg||
nt|idc: or perhaps that *did* show a good raise?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@H strikes me as an appropriate shot with south's hand knowing that any club honours with north likey  to be well placed|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|sybarra: this feels like it should make|pg||
nt|idc: NS CC just says raises are preemptive after dbl|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks infrangible in spite of the result we see in the open|pg||
nt|idc: I wouldn't expect a hand as good as North's in a million years on that sequence|pg||
nt|sybarra: Mike, you are killing us with the big words today |pg||
nt|lestergold: north shouldhave bid 3@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: perhaps south knows his customer|pg||
nt|idc: agree Mike and even then I'd worry I was too good|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i would not go that far!|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think too good for 3 @H's |pg||
nt|lestergold: checkback i assume |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: its flattish an A and K what else can you bid Shirley|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Surprised?  They'll be banking on it.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|cuttysark: No heart overcall in the other room|pg||
nt|sybarra: another option is XX and raise (not my favo) |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: jack|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this is ok too|pg||
nt|rodal f: But wich black hook after 1@H?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Decalrer has to guess which black suit to finesse - rather like an earlier hand he got wrong. |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Rather him than me|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he first has to play his queen|pg||
nt|lestergold: and they fiind the 4/4 fit|pg||
nt|lark20: very fortunate lie of the spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a great contract less than 50% but makes today|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: redouble sorry not in my book|pg||
nt|lestergold: overtrick on the lead|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: mopre strength and less hearts for that|pg||
nt|sybarra: not in mine either...|pg||
nt|idc: I agree with 3@h, just that it is upper range for that|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Of course, the scoring makes it worth being in games which are just below 50%.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|cuttysark: Can't see him getting this right - has to win @HQ and finesse a spade immediately, where he can leave the club finesse till he has cashed the diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes indeed|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: maye Smith thought ew would be n the bidding somewhere,  bidding 2 @H,  then can balance with 3 @H ,  hoping for X |pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: got to watch the "seniors" |pg||
nt|idc: I guess declarer needs 2 @s ruffs but no rush |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: the only slight clue is south played like a man with no entry|pg||
nt|lestergold: well there is a rush now |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Surprised he did not play @HQ - from here it looks the only chance|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|c5|nt|sybarra: this works |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this is not so nice, Moyna needs to ruff and @C and also finesse @S|pg||

nt|barnets: to stop in 4@H|pg||
nt|barnets: no losers outside hearts|pg||
nt|garnetts: I can't see why you need to show defence--they are not likely to bid --and you are not likely to have a slam on--add that to a slow 3@H |pg||
nt|barnets: and west knows if his partner has  just 1 it will play mostly for 1 loser|pg||
nt|yo_yo: are you saying you bid 4@H with 0-12 points?|pg||
nt|jtr: After West only rebid 2@h i guess it was sensible to pass 4|pg||
nt|barnets: on the last hand there was no real need for north to show invitational valued in my opinion|pg||
nt|barnets: as he would x any bid by e/w|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|barnets: he does not need to put his partner in the picture|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: which rebid is stronger here? 2@H or 4@H?|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe 5@h was best over 4@h?|pg||
nt|barnets: As i said immediately it is very hard to stay out of slam here|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: what does a 4@H rebid show?|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|nt|barnets: not an elegant spot|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@S seems odd to me --I would play 4@H as influenced by the 2@C bid--so if East wants to go on 4NT RKCB looks the right move |pg||
nt|garnetts: xx AKQxxxx x Axx  in my idea of 4@H over 2@C |pg||
nt|barnets: david's idea of 5@H looks ok to me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if it shows that, garvey was right to look for slam (in @H)|pg||
nt|barnets: over 4@H although maybe 6@H looks ok also|pg||
nt|garnetts: well 5@H does ask for good hearts but 4NT will let you find out won't it?  |pg||
nt|barnets: with your example hand i think 3@H is the right bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i tend to use the bid as a bit better than a 4@H opener|pg||

nt|rednaxela: It's a very friendly club and I would recommend anyone visiting the islands to go along.|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4@h cold|pg||
nt|lark20: At last we have found fits in the long suits|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|d|nt|lestergold: when he has a mopnster he would bid game and go off not thanking his partner for responding on a quarter of a trick|pg||
nt|rednaxela: I see that Smith and Marshall have recorded back-to-back -500s in the Open Room.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: 2@D multi - weak in @H or @S only|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: 4@s looks like only two off for 300|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: ok ok you convinced me |pg||
nt|lestergold: dont bid one more Ken|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Club lead beats 4@H, but not easy for North to find that|pg||
mb|5H|mb|d|nt|idc: In the OR, the auction was interesting: West passed over 3@d then backed in with a game bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well I th9nk west was worth an effort here|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: the @D lie well for declarer, can get some @C discarded|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: however all leads beat 5@h|pg||

nt|cuttysark: This looks one down from here, but the defenders still have to beat it|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: does e/w play 4 card majors|pg||
pc|d5|nt|idc: I can understand not making a game try, but competing to 3@h seems normal|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cuttysark: To misquote edgar Kaplan: double is a good call on this hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: I don't know if Es 1@H prommice 5 cards. If it's 4 card opening W have for a support X and not 2@H.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I expect there is a way to let it through - ducking aces has been a feature of the tournament :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: yes i saw a spectacular one yesterday|pg||
nt|rednaxela: If his partner's K@S had been the A@H he might have done the right thing.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If 2@S is a game try, should West bid something other than 4@H? |pg||
pc|h8|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|c9|nt|cuttysark: I am sure they do not play Support Doubles - they do not gel with the weak no-trup style.|pg||
nt|rodal f: I see.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or to put it another way, support doubles where not invented in 1942|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I guess they had to play clubs early - these early plays are never easy|pg||

nt|idc: Oops, scratch my comment about competing: I was in some other part of the universe|pg||
nt|lestergold: nice 4@h available for e/w|pg||
nt|sybarra: not to stay out of 6 @H with trumps not breaking |pg||
nt|idc: or possibly a different one|pg||
nt|cuttysark: With 6 cards missing the jack the best odds play is to finesse - but not when South has thrown a diamond|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Jean wasnt tempted to finesse in @D |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: *not=now|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|idc: A 4@d splinter from West might excite East|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|lestergold: with this top heavy hand i would prefer to show the nspqades on the way if anything than splinter|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N or as it happens 5@c cold as cards lie|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Weak 1NT at N in OR|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that one exceeds my fear level|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|idc: CC says 3@c is Baron - some kind of balanced game raise - my guess is the CC is out of date|pg||
mb|p|nt|lark20: with clubs sitting right, this is a good contract|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: well hardly balance|pg||
nt|idc: As a few specs have mentioned to me, 1@s is a better shot with the West hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: well if Baron, may alert them to the problem |pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Wow - it is OK to open  weak NT with an 11 count, but I don't like to do ite with 4-3-3-3, particularly if partner is going to move with that South hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did they have weak 1NT openings in 42?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, was keystone of acol|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Oh yes - and even earlier|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Since North's hearts are not great he may well have an ace on the side|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: But he will not have both aces, so it looks right to clear spades and sit back|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Looks more like a delayed game raise with a @s suit, than shortage in @d being the key feature|pg||
nt|lestergold: wrong sided but it doesnt matter with club right|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: imagine sitting in a musty hall at cambridge during the second world war|pg||
nt|sybarra: or blackwood will  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: You would prefer to have the henad with @SK on lead, but that is difficult to judge|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|cuttysark: If South decides to use Stayman - and why not, the chances of a 4-4 majors fit are quite good - she d=should bid 2@H over 2@D and hope to survive in a 4-3 fit|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

nt|lestergold: roland has got into the bidding here for him an ecellent slam|pg||

nt|cuttysark: So sorry - don't go yet, still time for Wales to make a few more inroads|pg||

pc|h6|nt|rodal f: It's might OK to wait E was not limited and NS at vul. |pg||
nt|cuttysark: It is suggested that Ns may play a convention known as 'Lionel' wher dbl shows 4+spades and another suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I guess penalty doubles of the weak NT are not very frequent - but I would be reluctant to give them up!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lionel was never designed for use over weak no trump|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is not so much penalizing as distinguishing strong versus competitive bids over the weak nt|pg||

nt|yo_yo: Williams bid 3@S on this in the other room|pg||

nt|vugraphzjc: -2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: slam time|pg||
nt|lestergold: pretty good slam here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: only 19 imps a board needed for the tie|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: seems to me -1 is right given the defense, but I think n/s missed a trick |pg||
mb|2D|nt|fabsayc: warming up the redouble cards|pg||
nt|idc: Thanks - at least I've proved what I said: I didn't know what was going on|pg||
nt|sybarra: right sorry -2 |pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|rodal f: Ain't any easy 4@S. 3NT is better.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: note 6N by south is infrangible on any lie of thecards|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|idc: The Irish play 2 over 1 game forcing, so let's see how they use the extra space|pg||
mb|3S|nt|idc: 3NT thin but possible here|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: no messing around :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cuttysark: That's how it's done :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well he will find out the good news in @D in a minute |pg||
nt|yo_yo: and the @C finesse works|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @H  are 3-3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that adds up to a make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: I prefer 2NT on 2nd round from South I think|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: lets see if W bids it  |pg||
nt|sybarra: yes he did |pg||
nt|idc: With SOuth having neither Ace for an entry, even @h lead is no good|pg||
nt|lestergold: did a wheel come off or would it be better to say that a wheel never came on!|pg||
nt|rednaxela: The difficulty is that south hasn't agreed Spades.  If 2@s showed 6 then 3@s by south might be better than 3@c.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|fabsayc: this one maybe too tough to find 3nt|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: might do it with forcing stayman|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is feeble|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
mc|12|nt|idc: On the previous board, 2@h by E was doubled in OR, but only -1 so a flat board|pg||
nt|idc: Now I think on it, this attack on declarer's communications may be best|pg||
nt|idc: declarer has to decide how to time playing @s & @d|pg||
nt|idc: play one suit too much and perhaps defenders can continue it to set up tricks|pg||

nt|idc: I can hear the drum roll from here :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: kibitzers are assuring me he had the count |pg||
nt|lestergold: and deserves to cost CBAI|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Last board of the set, though the open room is a few behind.|pg||
nt|idc: And a quiet 4@h for EW to finish I predict|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: sorry Ian  while we are suppose to be neurtral  sort of cheering for you guys |pg||
nt|idc: another close game that needs guesses - 4@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: no medal for that prediction|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|yo_yo: and yes, of course he did|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Last board of the day. We should thank all the organisers, and kath Nelson who has been a great commentator all day.|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hobby in Norway by 4 friends. When @D7 is done u go for @C7 - @S6 etc.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: thanks Liz and everyone|pg||
nt|cuttysark: We are back at 10am tomorrow for the denouement|pg||
mb|p|nt|rednaxela: On the hand where i predicted the Scots in the open room would bid their 22 count to game, they have been beaten to the punch - the Irish have bid their 18 count to 4@h.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i would like to see what Scotland make of that last hand|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|idc: That's sweet.   I used to use the St Lucia flag rather than Scottish one but BBO told me to 'fess up|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: 5 4 in hearts  spades|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Last board of this match - a 12 imp lead means 18-12 to Northern Ireland.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|idc: Scotland coming bottom in last European Teams caused me to change flag, to much pity from other commentators!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Players have a short break now - restart at 15.40|pg||
nt|idc: Time to thank people who have made this broadcast possible|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Liz  @H |pg||
nt|idc: Operator Christine Walker, BGB representative Sandra Claridge, SBU West District who are running the event, and the sponsor, Bernard Teltscher.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|idc: My fellow commentators Shirley & Mike|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|sybarra: we always love this event on bbo vugraph |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Time to thank everybody - the organisers, BGB and the West District of the SBU, our wonderful commentators and you, the spectators|pg||
nt|idc: And of course to BBO, without whom I'd be typing to myself.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx specs for great comments and humour|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: gosh the slam went down in the other room|pg||
pc|h5|nt|idc: seconded|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: at any rate thx to excellent operator and fellow commentators bye for now probably see some of you later|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yo_yo: well done moyna|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|pg||
nt|sybarra: the specs are the best!     we enjoy the comments and insights |pg||
nt|idc: A good game this but declarer will need to guess trumps (with the @dK wrong)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Current rankings can be found on sbuwest.co.uk/SeniorCamrose.html|pg||
nt|idc: Rae got trumps right at other table; big decision this|pg||
nt|cuttysark: That would be www.sbuwest.co.uk/SeniorCamrose.html|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice Liz,  that is easier for most of dummies |pg||
nt|sybarra: like me |pg||
nt|idc: Rae had a clue from @d lead that dK was wrong but I don't see that matters much|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cuttysark: Bit of a comic defence in the other room: Victor Silverstone lead @S7 and it was ducked to the eight|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East presumably thought it was second highest. Maybe better to lead the ten from this sort of holding|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|idc: The other table has some boards to go, but here it is time to thank those involved in our vugraph show|pg||
pc|d6|nt|yo_yo: ( i am slightly biased here, the mackenzies were our team mates recently in Killarney)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|sT|nt|idc: Just a guess in a sense, but restricted choice means K(JT) is twice as likely as JT in North|pg||
nt|sybarra: need the @D finesse now |pg||
pc|sA|nt|idc: though you can pick up KJxx in South, so close decision what to do|pg||
nt|sybarra: far from an easy hand |pg||
pc|s6|nt|yo_yo: We would have done better if I hadnt revoked at trick 1 (as declarer)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|idc: To our flawless Vugraph Operator, BGB representative Sandra Claridge, SBU West District who are running the event, and the sponsor, Bernard Teltscher.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cuttysark: Happens to us all, Kath - more often than we would like :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: now home |pg||
nt|idc: much easier if you don't have @h9, then KJ9x in South is no good for you, so % play is to duck|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: endplay alert|pg||
nt|idc: so NI win - well done to them|pg||
nt|sybarra: the card gods give you those spots for the challenge!|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Thank you everybody - play starts tomorrow at 11 am local time.|pg||
