nt|rnmalik: hi Marshall, Martin.|pg||
nt|chick: the diamonds are nice, and if the @DK were onside, this would actually make|pg||

nt|s bech: likley to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: NS play strong club, counting zz points. EW plays swedish standard (4c openings)|pg||

nt|chick: Hi Sveta and Matthias|pg||
nt|ziff:  Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: @S play needed to make 4@S|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Sveta|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this agreement gains popularity - if after partner's opening 1nt responder doesn't see more prospects than a game, he bids 4@c (or 4@d) with both majors|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  4@c shows better @h, while 4@d emphasizes @s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Here with 5/5 S had a good bid.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and minimum info for the opps|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @d lead looks normal and thereafter it's hard to bring contract home|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H understandably worried S with such a weak suit, but it is a bidder's game|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi Sveta|pg||

nt|xenya: should be a healthy pickup for Westerlund|pg||
nt|chick: bad luck in the lie of cards he will have to finesse, so even 5@C will be difficult, 6 hopeless|pg||
nt|peachy: he may of course not know it:)|pg||
nt|nobbe: should end up with 7 tricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: as specs suggest that the only contract making is actually 6@d - goodluck in trying to arrive there|pg||

nt|chick: necessary to set up the heart trick before giving E a chance to pitch a heart on @DQ|pg||
nt|chick: S shows good judgment to stop short with no spade cuebid from partner|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2uj293f  running scores|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They do have 9 tricks but in the race for tricks NS are likely to get 5 first|pg||
nt|turnip1: looks like 3S, 1C, 1D for the defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: 1@h promises 8+ hcp and 5+@s/balanced hand|pg||

nt|daman: he will have to play a @D towards the King|pg||
nt|daman: or make the opps play @Ds for him|pg||
nt|peachy: this also works, on the power of spots and if they play diam, all good|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S was lucky to see partner doesn't pass, but is hard to find altenative to 1@h opening|pg||
nt|yuval10: once again that's the reason why N didn't support @h right away|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  or someone votes for other one?|pg||
nt|turnip1: Playing the king is hard to find, but gives the declarer a better position|pg||

nt|arvidsson: the alternative is diamon |pg||

nt|arvidsson: if clubs break you have 11? just loosing 2 @H|pg||
nt|friggi: dec has to take @C A nad fin @S |pg||
nt|arvidsson: doubt he will play for KQ of @D onside|pg||
nt|friggi: agree, but that is the hand you have to draw, if you want to have a chance my friend:)|pg||
nt|s bech: I Dont think spade finesse is best line. just ruff one spade in dummy and try to only have 2 heart loosers|pg||
nt|s bech: or should you play clubs for 5-1 becouse of the lead?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: the best chance must be to play for @H 3-2 (being able for 2 loosers) and clubS 4-2?|pg||
nt|s bech: I think so|pg||
nt|friggi: dec has to play for sin @H|pg||
nt|arvidsson: but the lead is fishy.... maybe one can sniff the 5-1 |pg||
nt|s bech: but now decl might reconsider after the cl 3 lead|pg||

nt|s bech: here we go|pg||
nt|arvidsson: for that i am certain|pg||

nt|pbundy: very perceptive; i wouldn't be, either|pg||
nt|chick: a knowledgable kib suggests that this might be xy-nt probably 2 c inviting........any hand............. and 2d gameforcing|pg||
nt|daman: a bit unsettling for commentators when the systems are highly unusual|pg||
nt|peachy: the alert shows 1NR as trf, if I understand it correctly, both sides trf?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one might say: "yes but N has AKQ of trumps, and S who was missing them made a try".  true enough, but it was already those 3 top trumps that were the only possible justification ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for the 2S raise, so N has already bid that part of his hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure why E didn't knock out the @c entry|pg||

nt|cuttysark: As you say, he did very well to bid at all - I suppose he was trying to shut out the opener|pg||
nt|chick: unless the X shows diamonds, which is possible I guess|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The standard in Sweden must be pretty high given that two of the strongest teams in the country, S:t Erik Berik (last year's winners) and Malmö (with Fredin, Bertheau and Nyström) ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: were knocked out in the semi-finals|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if opener's are 6 up, passouts are impossible|pg||
nt|yuval10: if their system is to open from 6 and higher count, then it's probably safe to say they've never experienced any "all pass" in their partnership|pg||
nt|arvidsson: one could make it (i think playing K@H at trick 2)|pg||

nt|chick: 2@C =  both minors 6-11|pg||
nt|s bech: cullin showing his diamonds. Upmarks nice hand just got even better. |pg||
nt|s bech: heart lead in 6 diamonds?|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @s Q in slot, 4@s should make (if 2 rounds of @hs by opps... S simply pitches a @d|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and again|pg||
nt|turnip1: In 5S he will need to find the trump king after the club ruff|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and he very well might - so much for havoc|pg||
nt|ritong: i did not know rado as a system geek|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: ty for support Henri |pg||
nt|ignatov_bg: this is another Rado with same name|pg||
pc|h8|nt|tez: 3@s iyi yer|pg||

nt|pbundy: i wouldn't be passing now with the west hand ...  we'll see what he chooses|pg||
nt|chick: W should know that his partner is expecting some HCP that he doesn't have|pg||
nt|pbundy: 3@S could be making - along with 3@H.........|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Agreed|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, partnerships need to discuss the difference between pass and 3@S here by E.  One possible understanding is that when pd's cuebid has forced us to a certain level (here, ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@S), bidding it directly shows the weakest hand - and anything else, even passing, shows at least a modicum of game interest.|pg||
nt|yuval10: but as Meckstroth said - those "little"  imps adds quickly|pg||
nt|ziff:  Good decision by N/S, anyway|pg||
nt|arvidsson: lookes like they will end up in an unlucky slam |pg||
nt|chick: I still think it was safer to just win the @HA and get the ruff ... but I suppose at this level, an overtrick can be important|pg||
nt|ritong: when he plays on BBo, he is rather classical, plus of course the usual bulgarian overaggressivity|pg||
pc|h2|nt|atalok: 2 numarada diger masada 2 cl acýldý 3 d dendi ama 7 yinede soylenemedi|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: na pocz¹tek 2 trefle, karo do króla, trefl przebity|pg||
nt|mr murray: he is right|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow -- W must have seen some of E's o/c's.|pg||
nt|yuval10: if declarer try to play @h to hand he can suffer 2@d ruffs and go down ( 2@h, 1@c, 2@d )|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as S over 1S, double would make me uneasy. but so would 2C. just goes to show that awful overcalls in spades can still do damage to the opps even at the one level. but without ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: shape they usually do more damage to our side|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, did 2N promise 4S?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, it's not beautiful, esp with a void in pd's suit -- but can retreat to @C's comfortably b/c has 4@H's.  The one thing you don't want to do that you sometimes see newer ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: players do is make this negative double with just the @C -- pd will never stop putting you on @H's.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Don't know, maybe not - my comment above based on the perhaps faulty premise it was a @S raise.|pg||
nt|yuval10: Erev Tov Roland :)  all is well, great to see you here|pg||
nt|affe82: slam in diamonds might be tough on repeated heart leads|pg||
nt|s bech: spade lead is setting aswell|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tez: hýzlý 4@h dese þimdi 4@s gelirdi..yavaþ olunca zor|pg||
nt|chick: exactly the same principle I meant about the double-fit hands|pg||
nt|nobbe: 6@H looks most resonable contract|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|pbundy: interesting club spots, too|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: 1@h might actually have been natural|pg||
nt|chick: in any case, they arrived at the best spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: North has shown minimum and 6331|pg||
nt|daman: the made 6@H in the OR on Board 2 so a big, fat 17 IMPs to San Sac|pg||
nt|chick: the opps showed their clubs to each other rather than the spades, but in any case, did not lead the !A|pg||
nt|mrdct: this is quite a good layout for declarer despite the 4\2 break|pg||
nt|yuval10: after @d lead declarer will probably play A@h and @h towards hand|pg||
nt|s bech: 2H= 11-13 bal with 4c sup in hearts. |pg||
nt|friggi: what does 3H mean?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: did I say unlucky.... ment very lucky|pg||
nt|chick: 3NN is the contract in OR for bd 2|pg||
nt|s bech: spade lead makes even 5 diamonds shaky|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tomek: Gierul nie skontrowal nawet 3@H|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|chick: @DA*|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very surprising play|pg||
nt|chick: I'm sure it was a spade raise, showing a good hand.  E's pass over 3@D says the rest -- no interest in competing|pg||
nt|jcwla: Even if not, the principle applies to situations where pd has made a conventional raise forcing us to a particular level.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: holding three dead hearts, W probably viewd the negative double as a danger sign when LHO did not bid hearts. also the overcall perhaps is sometimes made on 4 cards. and as u say, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has probably seen the likes of this E hand and perhaps worse:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Right but need partnership agreement -- many pairs play the exact opposite: pass below the level of our force shows some interest.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Back in a flash.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes i never doubted that 2N showed spade support. my question was whether it promised four of them|pg||
nt|yuval10: why didn't S lead a @d ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think N should ask himself that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also, that question was not addressed to the principle you were stating Jordan. I was simply looking for reasons why W did not force to game|pg||
nt|andyv:  white on white save may win a few imps|pg||
nt|po-s: he mght also double and take it 4 down...|pg||
nt|turnip1: 4H make on 3 rounds of spades|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cuttysark: Probably a similar defence to what they play over 1NT - to save memory strain|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@d are ON, of course, so the overcall worked very well|pg||
nt|yuval10: you can say Erev tov to Ida as well...she'll understand u well|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chick: this may put Westerlund back up in the scores|pg||
nt|chick: as xenya said last session ... unusually normal :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: some plays 1@d xfer @h|pg||
nt|chick: well, credit to them finding a contract that has a chance|pg||
nt|affe82:  without interference that downside is negliable though.|pg||
nt|yuval10: E must bid 6@s now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: Shalom Roland|pg||
nt|yuval10: he already bid 4@s to show minimum|pg||
nt|chick: he may not, has to discount his @HQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Shabat Shalom Ida :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: he already discounted it with 4@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: after W made another try with 5@c he must respect it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's the case when Q is better than K|pg||
nt|yuval10: AX @d is an asset|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|aldek: na Acolu z karami otwieramy w holandii 2@D, zeby grac od silnej reki|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and good swith at trick 2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure why S doubled--was on top of 2S bid and has no heart card|pg||
nt|yuval10: for those who joins us now - the score is incorrect and is upside-down|pg||
nt|s bech: Hans-Ove picks up another 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|affe82: this will be hopeless. as (several) kibber(s) say any defence is setting|pg||
nt|po-s: sorry only 3|pg||
nt|ritong: ah ok|pg||
pc|sA|nt|aldek: troche przelicytowal|pg||
nt|boomelant: kara zniknely niestety|pg||
nt|tomek: po 2@S 3@H|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed 5@D is a fortunate make but with a combined 20 count and no special features...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 10 cards in the minors in West are good distributionals value|pg||
nt|mr murray: if opener was an American "naturale" diamond n/s dont buy the hand so easily|pg||
nt|cuttysark: True - the overcall made it impossible for Wset to bid diamonds on his own|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes Murray, 1@D open would work here|pg||
nt|s bech: so we´ll see a swing on scoreborad soon in favour of Skalman|pg||
nt|chick: a boring partscore here ... time to put your laundry in the fridge or get a beer from the dryer ... or is it the other way around?|pg||
nt|affe82: this board can lead to a shift of leaders|pg||
pc|s3|nt|atalok: ama mecbur býraktýlar 4 h demeye|pg||

nt|chick: this will go down, I'm not sure either side had a making contract |pg||
nt|chick: if the other table doesn't reach slam|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: exciting bidding -- i don't think i agree with W's 2 passes|pg||
nt|chick: agree, but perhaps he was afraid of pushing them to game ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Friendly placement of cards.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we convinced him )))|pg||
nt|yuval10: well bided|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|chick: still, no excuse not to pull his partners double with a 6-5 black hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The natural option of the 1C opening bid contains hands of 15-17 HCP which are almost certainly not pure two-bid hands, and so these can be a problem.|pg||
nt|daman: compressed 4 @D tricks into 3 :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: real score is 33:22 to Gullvi|pg||
nt|ziff:  "Real" score is 33-22, Gullvi|pg||
nt|ziff:  :)|pg||
nt|friggi: he wants to beat the contract - I guess:)|pg||

nt|h_karluk: These hands are also present in the 1C opening in standard systems, but there you have the option of rebidding in a new suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tempting to jump to 6S over 5C by W, but if W has a heart void there could be a grand slam|pg||

nt|h_karluk: descriptive rebid, in order to describe his holding. As a result, most of the responses are artificial in meaning.|pg||
nt|yuval10: trump lead might give declarer some difficulties, but he can still make because of 3-3 @c|pg||

nt|bridge_one: E/W make a easy 5@h - it is important (in IMP competition overall) to call game, because if opps make 4@S you wil lose too much - better a little risk (5@H-1 vs 4@s-1) that a game ...|pg||

nt|bridge_one: need to keep immediatly the 2 @d|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i would be willing to back into the auction at least at the 3 level|pg||
nt|s bech: 3-2 i hearts is enough for making 11. (almost) |pg||

mb|p|nt|mrdct: yep |pg||
nt|friggi: values has to be in H |pg||
nt|chick: The OR is on their last board, and we are half done|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: as expected, more imps to Varbergshus on 5|pg||
nt|affe82:  which, at least to me, makes the accomplishment of stopping in 3cl earlier with an A and a K in responders hand even more suprising.|pg||
nt|friggi: as I said before too much ash in the sky for the angels to fly around:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is a 7 loser hand versus a preempt going to 4@H|pg||

nt|ady: take the finesse though north also made the 2@C overcall|pg||

nt|marlowepi: yes he will find the Q of hearts poromptly|pg||
nt|affe82: but no source tricks? just 7 winners now or?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzjk: The results are a bit missleading since board 24 has been scored in some mystic way, giving Skalman 11 imp they havn't deserved (yet?)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be was more precise to play A in @C before @d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: when you can help your partner better to help|pg||

nt|yuval10: declarer can play safely here and play A@h and @h|pg||

nt|ady: sorry  there was no overcall bu North on hand 14   west opened 2@S  and the contract was 3NT|pg||
pc|d4|nt|nobbe: even with the 5-0 break declarer should not have to much trouble with his strong @Ss|pg||

nt|chick: hmmm, they have to set this a lot to compensate for a vul game|pg||
pc|sA|nt|atalok: 3nt degil bence|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: lekko krzywe otwarcie w tym rozdaniu nie przynios³o sukcesu|pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: ale juz od¿yli i analizuj¹ rozdanie :)|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: a tymczasem Auguri w 6 zagra³o 6|pg||
nt|xenya: in particular, i don't quite understand W's 2@H|pg||
nt|turnip1: important change of trump|pg||
nt|po-s: after all -I have a diamond control...|pg||
nt|turnip1: putting P under pressure?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: switch ten and 7 of spades and i think there would be a guard squeeze for 6N without a spade lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: yep and persumably N would've opened with 12 points and 4 @s's|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes that was my point. probably any 12 points but for sure with 4S which were known about|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 7@D is 4 off|pg||
nt|friggi: yes|pg||
nt|s bech: unlucky for E/W that N gets a chance to lead club if they reach, But that might not be the only lead she´s thinking about.|pg||
nt|arvidsson: onless a club lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2uj293f  running scores|pg||
nt|arvidsson: on a club lead it is 5 |pg||
nt|friggi: so he will play for 2-2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|tez: al @d asý @d as yap..al @h ruayý @c as yap..@s ve @d empaslarý gecsin..7 olur:)|pg||
nt|atalok: ama 3nt derdim kuzeyin eli ile en son|pg||
nt|tez: @h asý @d as yapacaktýk..yapamadýk:)|pg||
nt|tez: hayal kurmak bedava:)|pg||
nt|tomek: 3-cia dama kier pod nozem daje szanse na wygranie|pg||
nt|peachy: difficult to follow a completely artificial auction|pg||
nt|yuval10: the players here played all day long and fatigue probably takes its toll|pg||
nt|affe82: could be as expensive as 800|pg||
nt|chick: that would be enough :)|pg||
nt|affe82: looks like a good decision by NS|pg||
nt|chick: and the @CQJ is revealed, so no mistakes there|pg||
nt|chick: a nice system that worked well on this hand|pg||
nt|s bech: will declarer play clubs for ruff at this point? ending up with 5 sp 2 cl 2 he and one ruff |pg||
nt|turnip1: hans-ove in the lead!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yakop: h asý tref as yap o oluyo ben gecenlerde yapmýþtým:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jeli wierzyæ operatorowi w meczu M-M zagrano kontrakt 7 BA z reki S i po pierwszym wicie pikowym rozgrywajacy zaimpasowa³ waletam??????????|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: ja bym siê tym kontraktem nie chwali³, ale poszed³|pg||
nt|snetram: szczêscie po stronie Auguri|pg||
nt|garden2005: a w poprzednim rozdaniu bez dwóch figur kierowych: @s Axx @h Dxx @d AK10 @c Axxx kto by³by winien ?|pg||
nt|pbundy: certainly very conservative|pg||
nt|mrdct: good system hand for EW|pg||
pc|s7|nt|atalok: guney cl kesmiyor zannediyor lar bence|pg||
nt|tez: @h asý @c lerin arasýna koymuþum..@c as zannettim ortak mý dedin:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe there is one still with spade jack lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: OR has already finished while we have 5 more boards to go|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ah no, cant get to E hand to lead heart to ten without burning an entry|pg||
nt|chick: unfortunately those pretty diamond honors don't give useful pitches|pg||
nt|s bech: after cl A west should lead hearts|pg||
nt|turnip1: 149-148-145-143-141,5...|pg||
nt|ady: on hand 16 Skalman gained another 12 imps  when they played a hopeless 3NT in OR   a fortunate but playable 4@H made here|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|atalok: muhtemel artý 1 olacak|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: w rozdaniu 7|pg||
nt|zbig1959: akcja z typu Bols'a idee - Zia X pantery,, x na id¹cy kontrakt, aby odeszli na nieid¹cy |pg||
nt|aldek: w 4-tym, 5-tym i 7-mym byly niewiarygodne motywy w rozgrywce|pg||
nt|awasiak: 1BA standardowo na m³odszych, dalej wszystko naturalne.|pg||
nt|zbig1959: po blokach karta ronie, impas @H podniosl reke W.. (6 rozd)|pg||
nt|friggi: that is too much..hand up|pg||
nt|s bech: Team Yellow now 49 IMPs |pg||
nt|s bech: unexpected when we left in half-time|pg||
nt|arvidsson: this will be a good chance for Kamras, EW will probbebly bid 6 spades|pg||
nt|ritong: you are welcome, silvia|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mlodygda83: czyli znowu odskoczyli, a jeszcze 10 dojdzie|pg||
nt|daman: hopefully they don't get to slam off 2 @ces|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: They're now officially fighting against the clock - 5 boards ought to be played in 25 mins|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once he starts this will not takle long|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'd not hold my breath if they won't make it on time|pg||
nt|chick: and with the bad spade lie, -1 for sure now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|daman: Aces*|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes that has to be the explanation|pg||
nt|friggi: @C lead is also pretty obv in 7@D|pg||
pc|d5|nt|awasiak: Po wejciu dwukolorowym Jeleniewskiego rozgrywaj¹cy ma szansê trafiæ @sD.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right. it might even be right to pass 2S, but can have sympathy for W biddign a second time|pg||
nt|s bech: if decl can throw away hearts on diamonds, and play all his clubs East will be endplayd on spades|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|tez: @c leri alýrlarsa tam olacak|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer seem in no need to hurry mood|pg||
nt|ziff:  N/S did very well here to stay out of 3NT despite 25 HCP|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: i am worn out just from commentating, so i can imagine how tired the players are:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: those are 4 days in a row of many boards per day|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|po-s: If 1D really showed diamonds perhaps 2D could be a 2-suiter but in today´s bridge nobody has diamonds just because they bid them - if so 2D ought to show diamonds|pg||
nt|friggi: no values in @S is the main problem for W|pg||
nt|friggi: so @H PASS big time|pg||
nt|friggi: 3@H|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|nobbe: with diamonds 3-3 we have 10 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|rmb1: If the defence don't continue diamonds (revealing the break) declarer can take club finesse|pg||
nt|nobbe: after the first 5 boards scored in the second half, Kamras have increased their lead by 7 more imps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes there is a sense in which W opened 4H here|pg||
nt|arvidsson: Maybe south should x 5 @c?|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|arvidsson: WELL I AM NOT CERTAIN|pg||
nt|arvidsson: sorry caps lock|pg||
nt|friggi: after all this ..yes|pg||
nt|affe82: is finessing in clubs and play for @h discard an alternative?|pg||
nt|s bech: chanses of 11 if diamond A with north or that you can ruff 2 clubs without overruff|pg||
nt|affe82: the @d suite also offers some interesting options|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: this can go down now     needed to play low on the diamondlead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  CanÂ´t misguess @D|pg||
pc|h6|nt|s bech: good defended by east. More diamonds or clubs decl would have made 10 tricks|pg||
nt|s bech: by west*|pg||
nt|friggi: in USD yes, but maybe not in SE krones:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: W has shown 8-10 and 4324|pg||
pc|c7|nt|s bech: yes, slam it is and the pressure is now on North for the only setting lead.  Does she have enough inforation?|pg||
nt|turnip1: another IMP to Skalman|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|yuval10: i don't think he should X|pg||
nt|yuval10: he doesn't want a @c lead from a bare J for instance|pg||
nt|arvidsson: one cant be sure club is the right lead, could be @D one wants|pg||
nt|yuval10: and if P has JT @c he should hope that she'll find the lead herself|pg||
nt|friggi: if that would be tha case Emma would lead @C J is that a bad lead?|pg||
nt|andyv:  play of hand far less exciting than the bidding|pg||
nt|haans: but far less rewarding|pg||
nt|mcarroll: In a contest as close as this every imp counts|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If they lead 4th highest, S knows that W has no card higher than the 8 - the good old rule of 11|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Maybe he is thinking what to switch|pg||
nt|turnip1: yes, but he can think as much as he likes, no matter 2 tricks to NS|pg||
nt|isp: v po-rannite si godini s tazi raka doktora bi opital dori shlem :) yavno ostaryava :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ryskiel_: przepraszam za komentarz - zmêczenie|pg||
nt|cuttysark: In which case you would have to double, or bid 2NT to show the 'unbid'suits|pg||
nt|s bech: should West bid 1 spade ? how about XX if run? ofcourse a visit to the bank if P bids clubs|pg||
nt|ady: though still should make   can guess right later|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ignatov_bg: strange|pg||
mc|8|nt|xenya: and if the bid does show what W has, E is certainly worth another move|pg||
