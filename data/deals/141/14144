mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|patricck: 11 tricks EW and 9 tricks NS, so par is 5@S doubled down 2, but this is a game of who can push who|pg||
nt|patricck: West had a lot for that raise to 2@H, does East know how good he is?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h7|nt|patricck: I really don't like West's bidding. First raising to only 2@H and then passing 4@S but overruling partner to take it out into 5@H.|pg||

nt|vugraphzks: director being called|pg||
