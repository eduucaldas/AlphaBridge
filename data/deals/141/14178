mb|p|mb|1C|nt|rodal f: Some feew times tempo. If s was renonce/ single at @D and strong 4@S kill all.|pg||
nt|mrdct: good result for kiwis in the closed room|pg||
nt|patricck: To reduce the potential swing here to 3 imps Australia need to bid their slam and guess to finesse North for the Q@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: For a possible slam|pg||
nt|woozle: A manic 2H opening (majors, weak) at the other table had NS going for 1100...but EW can redress most of that if they can bid and make a slam here|pg||
nt|mrdct: i don't like south's double very much in the closed room|pg||
nt|woozle: maybe, but it's churlish to sit here and criticise someone who's just collected 1100|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|mrdct: didn't the doubler go for 1100?|pg||
nt|woozle: Travis shows the East hand as a weak notrump (better than bidding the clubs again) and Henbest's 2D is an artificial game-force|pg||
nt|vugraphzkq: sorry guys, may have net problems.....computers running very slow|pg||
mb|4N|nt|woozle: 4NT from Henbest here, invitational, looks like a practical move here|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: And Travis can hardly decline with a nice 14|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|woozle: But slam is difficult today, probably needing three spade tricks after the clubs break badly|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: after the @C break that way at least you are likely to play North for the Q@S based on vacant spaces|pg||
nt|woozle: 5D must be natural, because it doesn't fit any kind of Blackwood response with this East hand...but Henbest will have no interest in other suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: i think she's a chance to make as the layout will be well revealled at decision time|pg||
nt|rodal f: Travis ain't online now but what's the problem.|pg||
nt|mrdct: once @c are known to be 5-1 you need the @h finesse and finding the @SQ so vacant spaces should lead her to playing north for the @SQ|pg||
nt|woozle: Bailey might lead a spade from his 100 dishonours, which would hand over the contract|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|woozle: And so it proves...now three clubs, four diamonds, two hearts and 3 spades, for twelve tricks, but 3 imps to NZ|pg||
nt|rodal f: A ruul many use. A honor (@H) at one side make me hookthe other way (@S)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d8|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mrdct: needs to take a little bit of care not to block anything|pg||
nt|rodal f: By no info given.|pg||

nt|sybarra2: thx hi all  |pg||
nt|ish: Good pass by G coutts|pg||
pc|d3|nt|patricck: 11 tricks EW and 9 tricks NS, so par is 5@S doubled down 2, but this is a game of who can push who|pg||
nt|patricck: West had a lot for that raise to 2@H, does East know how good he is?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pretty sure PASS is relay|pg||
nt|sybarra2: helping get the tables set up |pg||
pc|d4|nt|alanz: I can provide some commentary on Newell/Reid system|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d2|nt|patricck: I really don't like West's bidding. First raising to only 2@H and then passing 4@S but overruling partner to take it out into 5@H.|pg||
nt|patricck: It actually turns out to be the right action, but that is not the point|pg||
nt|vugraphzks: director being called|pg||
nt|patricck: I'm guessing that it would be obvious that East made a slow double and then West decided to take it out|pg||
nt|patricck: :)But I have been wrong about that sort of thing before :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzks: that would be correct|pg||

nt|mrdct: or quickly anyway|pg||
nt|patricck: They get a second chance when in with A@D|pg||
nt|patricck: and North just MIGHT find the @H switch then|pg||
nt|mrdct: all pointing to a push|pg||
nt|patricck: Is North game to balance for the majors at this vul?|pg||
nt|mrdct: north thinking of bidding?|pg||
mb|2C|an| |nt|rodal f: If N don't want to show his majors.|pg||
nt|patricck: 21H can be beaten, but it is the sort of contract that also might be allowed to make|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|mrdct: @CK lead to beat it|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: That is the easy way, but it might be difficult anyway|pg||
nt|woozle: Travis opens 1NT and Rebecca Wood surprises us all by balancing with 2C, showing majors...2H can be beaten either with a club ruff or with lots of defensive trump leads|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: Hmm, well that is definitely too much|pg||
pc|h4|nt|woozle: Wood notices that her partner has bid one of her suits and raises...definitely too much, down one or two (probably two after that start)|pg||

nt|vugraphzks: I did check|pg||
nt|littlejuzz: Not the best start for the Aussies|pg||
mb|1C|nt|littlejuzz: Neither pair has played on vugraph before, a daunting experience |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|patricck: With the @D lead looking like a singleton declarer should have played to the K@S and led a @H up, that way the A@H is played on nothing and declarer can afford to ruff the 2nd @D ...|pg||
nt|patricck: high|pg||
nt|patricck: The fact that 5@H went off will save the Director some work, North/South are no longer feeling disadvantaged|pg||
nt|ish: They must be very nervous|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hi Alan -- so can I [i've studied their system AND yours]|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: It seems that the diamond suit of KQJ1098 is in fashion. Exactly the same suit that North held on board 1|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|vugraphzks: 9 tricks may be hard to find here|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|patricck: should be 2 down, when South wins the A@C they can lead the K@H through for a ruff|pg||
nt|alanz: Hi Al, you probably know their system better than me then :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||

nt|rodal f: Thx, and sorry:)|pg||
nt|woozle: An opening for NZ here, Laura Ginnan failing by one trick in 4H in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|an| |nt|woozle: Bailey might have opened something if he had a system bid or had ODed on caffeine|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Henbest opens a fairly sound weak two|pg||
nt|woozle: befitting the vulnerability|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|woozle: Bailey should do something here...bidding any particular suit is too unilateral, so double is as good as anything|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same start and X from S by a direct 4@H at CR|pg||
nt|patricck: Declarer got the trumps right in the CR and still went down|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@H=push all else a gain for NS|pg||
nt|woozle: Wood has choices here - 3 or 4 hearts, 2 or 3NT, or playing for penalties|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mrdct: in the other room declarer didn't pitch her losing @C on the @SAK before play @HA and another and had no entry to the top @S after the @HK won|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s8|nt|woozle: Wood takes the low road, and surely Bailey has done enough despite providing a good dummy...this should make 3 or 4 for 5-6 imps to NZ|pg||

nt|ahollan1: if you're up to it -- spy on other tables using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: I'm not sure how much West had shown, but at teams it was important to duck the 2nd club in case it could be beaten. Maybe it would have been a more interesing decision at ...|pg||

mb|3H|nt|tez: 2nt invitation hand artificial|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: N/S had a sacrifice in @C, but unless North was inclined to open an undiscipled 3@C with a side 4 card major there was no way to get there|pg||
mb|3S|nt|alanz: 3@H appears to be the limit for NS|pg||

mb|3C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|shinge: Now would we all raise to 4 on Justin's hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: Howard will|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1 more round today   on vugraph we'll have  Open:  Chinese Taipei v China   U26: Japan v China Hong Hong|pg||
mb|3S|nt|alanz: Board 12 was a Biltcliffe coup|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|5C|nt|shinge: You're right Howard has !!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=11-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: but i dont agree with that 3s opening-in 2nd seat preempts shd be sound and classical |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Biltcliffe coup?   don't know that one|pg||
nt|alanz: Could have been passed out in 3@S, reopened, got to game, doubled and made it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzks: Tsang has questions :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|alanz: If you do all that it's a Biltcliffe coup|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: let's find Biltcliffe and show him what for|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|psridhar: u r preempting only 2 players one being yr pd|pg||
pc|cT|nt|shinge: I think it is correct to do so for a number of reasons.. The first strong inference for things to be better than they may is E passed..|pg||
nt|psridhar: compare it to first seat preempt -where u preemot 2 oppo and one pd|pg||
pc|c2|nt|patricck: I can live with, but not like the 3@D overcall, but the 5@D needs more distribution|pg||
nt|shinge: Is that it? No more boards..just warming up.. Cheers and thanks all "watchers" and commentators..|pg||
nt|psridhar: thanks all bye|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks. C...............U.|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|s9|pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
pc|hT|nt|patricck: Certainly between them North/South shouldn't have embarked on this venture|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h2|nt|alanz: Particularly annoying for opponents|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|patricck: losing 1 trick in every suit should be 3 imps to NZ and 18-12 in VPs. Australia still ahead of them by 8 VPs in the race for 2nd place|pg||
nt|patricck: assuming that NS cash out accurately|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|patricck: Chinese Taipei have already won the Under 21 being ahead by an impressive distance even with 2 matches left to play|pg||
pc|s7|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: next set begins in about 35 minutes|pg||
nt|alanz: Other room is also in 4@s doubled on board 12 |pg||
nt|alanz: down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzks: sorry that was 1 off|pg||
pc|sA|nt|patricck: A lot of defence with those 2 Aces in a flat hand, unless she was thinking it would make it seems the wrong sort of hand|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|c4|pg||
mc|10|nt|patricck: AAh, did a trick go missing?  That makes the result 19-11|pg||
nt|patricck: actually...20-10 by 1 imp....NZ only 4 behind Australia now|pg||
nt|patricck: Australia have to play the strong (winning) Chinese Taipei now.....  New Zealand will be cheering for Chinese Taipei to give them a chance to overhaul Australia|pg||
