nt|rednaxela: Evening, Anne.|pg||
nt|rednaxela: So far England have won all their matches, but England 2 (or the Sponsor's team) are close behind them.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: hello all and welcome to the 3rd session of the day, the 9th session in total|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rednaxela: England 1 are in a clear lead, and so far unbeaten.|pg||
nt|idc: Good morning all, welcome to the final day of the Senior Camrose 2010|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|rednaxela: John Holland has been undertaking fact finsing missions to Scotland.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|rednaxela: He recently lost a marathon Scottish Cup final that went to several sets of extra boards.|pg||
nt|idc: Eng 1 on 80 VPs,  Eng 2 on 73 if I can still add|pg||
nt|rednaxela: England 2, more accurately the Sponsor's Team, lie in 3rd place.|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: England 2 are the sponsors team, and a pretty good one too|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rednaxela: The Patron's team actually won last year's event but are not elligible to hold the trophy.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: (3d was alerted too)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjc: oops!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk10: Welcome to Oliver Clarke and Adam Magyar|pg||
nt|oliverc: hi everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzmh: Hi wellcome|pg||
nt|galadriel: The 2NT opening means they will play in @H rather than S but 4 of either major is fine|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good Morning, all and welcome to the Seniors Camrose.|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: hi Ivan|pg||
nt|idc: Morning Alex - or perhaps I should say Middle of the Night Alex|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk10: Last 8 boards of the tournament|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cuttysark: We are a little short of commentators - all welcome|pg||
pc|d6|nt|idc: Bernard Teltscher faces an unenviable choice of a major - so he has sensibly let partner speak|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good afternoon, and wlecome back to the Seniors Camrose in Glasgow|pg||
nt|rednaxela: For you perhaps!|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzmh: Current standings before last round GIB 183 Quantum 183 Shato rosenovo 178 Bacho 170|pg||
nt|Walddk10: wow tied 1st|pg||
pc|s3|nt|oliverc: so a nebulous 1@D from North, but the rest of the bidding fairly predictable|pg||
nt|sundiszno: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk10: Borth pairs play Precision|pg||
nt|Walddk10: Hi Adam|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Ys, most tournament pairs have a way of finding out about a 5 card Major in the 2NT opener, but when they have one of their own they tend to show that.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sorry, Ian, I interrupted you in full flow :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good afternoon, and welcome back to the Seniors Camrose for the match between Scotland and England 2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|idc: I can hear the specs shout with one voice: THANKS LIZ!|pg||
nt|idc: I forgot you have young(ish) children|pg||
pc|sK|nt|galadriel: 2NT shows 19-20|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Had East been 5-2 in the Majors a 5-3 Spade fit could have been missed.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|sundiszno: so this can be the final |pg||
nt|oliverc: this should make fairly comfortably|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Good stop by E/W, though slam can be made.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Current scores are: England 168; England 2 134; Northern Ireland 121; Ireland 113; Scotland 113; Wales 68|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Both pairs play basically natural systems with strong(ish) NT and 5-card majors|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|galadriel: Although even if you play 20-22, this is probably worth an upgrade|pg||
nt|idc: The defence to 1@hX could have been a carnage but it's a bit double dummy to manage that|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|sundiszno: fairly comfortably is a little bit of an axaggeration :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Paterson will switch back to spades given the chance...|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|idc: If East leads singleton @d that cuts communications for the defenders and declarer might escape relatively cheaply|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rednaxela: Although this is England v England, the table has an international feel.|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|lark20: Thks Liz I will not be here all the time|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|sundiszno: but in this layout, you cannot go wrong is spades|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|idc: There are 5 teams from the British Isles in this event, plus a sponsor's team (England 2 who we are watching)|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: They are in 2nd place now, but a massive 34 VPs behind England; hard to see anyone catching England|pg||
pc|d3|nt|barnets: 6@H could make even on a spade lead|pg||
nt|barnets: declarer could cash the @HAK|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|barnets: and then build a 4th diamond|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|barnets: for a spade discard|pg||

nt|barnets: but that is not a likely play|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|c9|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s3|nt|idc: In the OR, Jack Paterson also ducked the @cK against 3NT and the game went -3 for a flat board|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||

nt|galadriel: Short making short work of the play :)|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Hallberg is from Sweden.  Silverstone is from Scotland, Waterlow is in Ireland and Holland...|pg||
nt|rednaxela: ...is from Manchester.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: you occasionally make 3NT with a combined 21 points - but not often!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: We don't have any CCs for either pair, so we will make up their system as we go along|pg||
mb|2N|nt|idc: 1@h looks to be natural :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|idc: I used to overcall 1NT with that sort of hand all the time, but partners persuaded me that average 15 counts were not good enough|pg||
nt|rednaxela: So a big swing to England 1 right away.|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Up to date scores and some CCs can be found at: http://www.sbuwest.co.uk/SeniorCamroseTeams.html|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sundiszno: wondered if he wouldn't open this hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello everyone from a rainy Manchester|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|oliverc: East? easy opening for precision|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 2@d is some kind of GF relay, I think|pg||
nt|sundiszno: yes|pg||
nt|idc: maybe it was the way I played them|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think the 2NT opener shows 20-21, but Paterson has upgraded because of the 5-card suit and good controls|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i was a bit surprised John Holland didnt double the last contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|rednaxela: After a 1@s opening in the other room E/W got to 3NT on board 1.  1 imp to Scotland.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: He is usually sharp on  the doubles|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: 19-20 possibly 21 says E|pg||
pc|c5|nt|idc: the alternative for West was 1@s, not an unreasonable 4 card overcall|pg||
nt|cuttysark: OK - sorry, must study the CC :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The 'backward' trump finesse (running @HJ on the first round) would work here, but it is a 25% shot|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|idc: England are currently 28 VPs ahead of N Ireland in 2nd place - they will be tough to catch|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sundiszno: this depends basically on finding @sQ and @cJ|pg||
nt|sundiszno: easiest is to find @sQ|pg||
pc|h9|nt|galadriel: With such a weak hand, Short chooses to lead partner's suit|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|sundiszno: but if the defense doesn't attack @hs early, you have plenty of time for even going wrong |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|oliverc: quite|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Partners like that sort of thing.|pg||
nt|galadriel: he himself has no sign of an outside entry|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North cannot get partner on lead to give him his ruff|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|oliverc: no particular reason to get the Clubs right here|pg||
nt|idc: The defence aren't getting the most from their cards here: @h lead would probably have led to 3 down & 500|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|galadriel: No lead will beat this though|pg||
mc|12|nt|cuttysark: So a second flat board|pg||

pc|h9|pc|d8|pg||
nt|idc: he could be I guess but the @h pitch not the answer as cards lie|pg||
nt|idc: If declarer tries to ruff his low @h high in dummy he might get close to making this|pg||

nt|oliverc: yup|pg||

nt|sundiszno: again an easy game|pg||
nt|galadriel: 1NT is 14-16|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|rednaxela: Some people would have opened the North hand in 3rd seat at these colours.|pg||
nt|galadriel: AJ doubleton worth a slight downgrade|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|oliverc: The Aceless North hand not worth a push|pg||
nt|sundiszno: didn't you deal decisive boards for the last round, Ivan? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmh: how about a club lead|pg||
nt|galadriel: perhaps?|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: :) X-ray vision a wonderful thing|pg||
nt|idc: This is an interesting play problem in 4@s|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Brave bid by Waterlw under a lot of pressure.|pg||
mb|p|pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|idc: If Tony can manage an elimination then East might be left on lead with the 4th round of diamonds to be endplayed|pg||
pc|s4|nt|idc: Yes, it doesn't quite have the look of a push-on-to-5 hand|pg||
nt|rednaxela: He may have hoped for a double fit.|pg||
nt|rednaxela: And found one.|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|sundiszno: @s now|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|idc: The @h lead makes that more likely|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rednaxela: I'm not sure. 2-3-4-4 is at least better than 3-3-3-4.|pg||
nt|idc: Of course, he couldn't pass I'm sure, since the 4@h UCB created a forcing pass situation at the 5 level|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|galadriel: Well, it's described as "sound" so we can't argue with that|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East choosing a no-so-safe trump lead: but declarer canot get at dummy's club tricks. |pg||
pc|c5|nt|yo_yo: John has a glimmer of hope|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s2|nt|idc: I'm guessing that, but most pairs would have that treatmment|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: 4H = splinter|pg||
nt|rednaxela: I would guess that 4@h was a splinter.  |pg||
nt|rednaxela: Christine, was 2@s H + a minor or H + C?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|idc: So it was (my eyes aren't focusing reliably at this early hour) so scratch "UCB" and replace with "splinter"|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: H + minor|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||

pc|s3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Had Short opened a suit he would have found his way to 1NT anyway, the rebid showing 17-18.|pg||
nt|galadriel: Holland and Hallberg don't have a system posted - anyone know what they play?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|idc: @hQ pitch @c, then lead @d5 and discard a !"c from SOuth on it|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Intersting line from decalrer, but it looks as if he will make just one more trick with @DA|pg||

nt|rednaxela: So, England 2 strike back.|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Played the other way up in OR, @cJ lead meant a quick -1|pg||
nt|idc: the point still valid - once you have shown game values opposite opening bid, can't let opps play undoubled|pg||
mb|1H|nt|copeyj: Strong NT, 5cM and 3 weak 2s I think (Hi all btw :))|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sundiszno: 2@c precision here|pg||
nt|oliverc: 2@C surprises me|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 11-15, 6+ @c, or 5+ @c and 4+M|pg||
nt|oliverc: Normally precision pairs would prefer 1@H over 2@C with the West hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzmh: you leap in @H with shows 6-5 when you open 2@C|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Yes.|pg||
nt|idc: so West's pass over 5@h was at least midly encouraging for East to go on|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|galadriel: Thanks Simon - and Hi :)|pg||
nt|idc: One of the reasons I took to bridge in the 1980s was that play started in the afternoons, unlike chess tournaments|pg||
nt|idc: now that all seems to have changed - a pity|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|rednaxela: A wheel seems to have come off for the Scots in the Open Room on board 2.  With a vulnerable game on they defended a non-vul 2C-6.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And a third flat board - is this tight bridge?|pg||
nt|jtr: Ambitious 3@h maybe but they play 4-card majors|pg||

nt|copeyj: extraordainary reason to which it doesnt look to me like you do on that hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a dangerous double by michael Macdonagh|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: That's on the basis that it's easier to persuade East that you have a 5th Club after|pg||
nt|oliverc: opening 1@H than having a 5th heart once you open 2@C|pg||
nt|rednaxela: I recall that even early afternoon starts gave you trouble some times in these days.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Silence is Golden, but not typical of you, David|pg||
mb|p|nt|sundiszno: ok, but you must persuade hime you have a 6th also|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: Paterson explained it is 14-16 or a poor 17 count before play|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Agreed. To me that was a normal 17 count.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Usually it shows the other 2 suits|pg||
nt|lark20: esp vul|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I fell a victim to that recently, my partner didnt have the  2 suits he promised|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in fact it cost us the event|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I think 1NT or pass with the south hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and take action when 2@C comes back round to me|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning all |pg||
nt|jtr: Well, i dont want to be the first person banned by Walduk|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|nt|jcomyn: ho9oray|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|copeyj: It was neither of them. It had two four card suits - makes it positively good for me :)|pg||
nt|jtr: A trump switch makes this interesting|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|galadriel: Interesting result on board 2 in other room|pg||
nt|galadriel: EW going 6 down for a gain of 8 imps :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|rednaxela: I'm guessing neither could make a penalty double, but someone had to do something!|pg||
pc|d7|nt|oliverc: I would merely point out that 4@H probably making here whereas 5@C is not :)|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|jtr: this will do too of course|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|sundiszno: and in this hand, even if east had a 3rd @h, 5@c is safer, youdon't get shortened|pg||
nt|idc: Lots of good comments from specs|pg||
nt|idc: That's true, but I prefer to think of it as exceptional time management when I arrived at the table bleary eyed at 13:59|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|evtimov: opening 2@C is more aggressive than 1@H|pg||
nt|oliverc: true|pg||
nt|sundiszno: no, you get shortened right after the lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: If you don't play pass as forcing on 2 in the open room then S had to act|pg||

nt|sundiszno: if @hs are 33, you can make 4@h, but if not, you go down quite a lot|pg||

nt|copeyj: i wld have tox and bid 3@C over 2@D|pg||
nt|lark20: perhaps continuing the cross ruff would have been better|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree|pg||
nt|idc: Holland's 3@c may show a value raise to the 3 level with @s support|pg||
nt|idc: though some play it as a "mixed raise" - a hand between a preempt and a value raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: 3c = 4card support at least invitational|pg||
nt|jtr: Guess it was a good stop even so|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|idc: looking at his hand, they play the former treatment|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|yo_yo: The Irish play 2/1 , 15-17 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|evtimov: normal contract 3NT for -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzmh: they missed a game earlyer 1nt opening vs 9count|pg||

mb|2S|nt|idc: West has a nice looking hand for 3NT now - 3 outside tops and some chance of 6 running @d|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|idc: Thanks Operator (Christine)|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: too many intermediates in the North hand for that here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sundiszno: these two teams are tied in 1st place, so if they are close to a tie, a team from table 2 can win the event|pg||
mb|p|nt|evtimov: now if play @H maybe =|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Always an anxious moment when you open at the 1 level on a hand like this and see it passed out.|pg||
nt|idc: I meant playing in 3NT - not bidding it right away - this enquiry is sensible|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, I think their range is 15-17. Paterson/Short play 14-16|pg||
pc|h8|nt|yo_yo: I like 1NT with the South hand but Michael obviously doesnt with a 5 card major|pg||

pc|c3|nt|yo_yo: 3NT if you can see all the cards|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Scotland pick up the first swing of the match on Board 4 - they had stopped well in 3@C, but England 2 tried 3@S - tow down|pg||

nt|jtr: West must duck the @d|pg||

mb|p|nt|oliverc: Support Double here showing 3-card @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzmh: not realy probably just points|pg||
mb|2N|nt|idc: North worth a 4@c advance cue here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: Having eschewed the Lucas opening, Short will like his hand now|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks as if South's 2@D overcall in the other room was ASPTRO? Anyway, they need todiscuss what 3@H means. Probably will now|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I think so - that @dK looks pretty good |pg||
nt|idc: I'm afraid none of the pairs on show in this match have provided CCs, but we can assume that was a multi 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: maybe. no chance of West having 5-card @S|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|galadriel: And so would I - if I played Lucas :)|pg||
nt|idc: Although it seems like just needing a 3-2 trump break, a little extra work needed in 6@s|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcomyn: indeed cagey stuff|pg||
nt|lark20: unfortunately Teltscher had nothing more to say|pg||

nt|idc: Just about worth being in it mind you - I guess Teltscher decided that say a 6 card @d suit was needed or something else extra|pg||

nt|rednaxela: 3NT seems normal.  In the Open Room a Lucas 2@h by West caused N/S to play in Spades.|pg||
nt|jtr: Apart from the @h break|pg||
nt|cuttysark: God contract till hearts break 4-0|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3NT not a silly contract at all, but ...|pg||
nt|jtr: He may well get the bad news at trick one|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yo_yo: John wanted to show his shape and Gunnar decided that was a safe place to play|pg||

nt|idc: Thanks Christine, that's useful info|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: Waterlow explaining VS made slam try 16 + he accepted it but VS decided not to on|pg||
mb|p|nt|rednaxela: I would have thought that 2@d followed by 3@d would get East's hand across.|pg||
nt|idc: It looks like Victor Silverstone tried for a 4-4 @c fit as a slam try, ignoring the weak 4 card @h suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: Yes, he might have tried 3|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Pass is rather timid with a 6 card suit opposite a take out double.|pg||
nt|copeyj: this is also a good stop - and in addition a good lead from Paterson|pg||
nt|copeyj: I think N/S play 5cM but Holland chose to open a tactical 4 card 1@S in 3rd (non vul obv)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: draw 2 rounds of trumps and set about the @D?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Englands score is about to soar,  4@S  on board 7 about to make|pg||

pc|c9|nt|idc: So I guess we've had a puppet Stayman sequence and East is declarer|pg||
nt|jtr: They can beat 3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rednaxela: It looks like weak NT was in use in both rooms.  This is the sort of hand where having one pair playing 14-16 guarantees you a swing - of some sort.|pg||
nt|rednaxela: I'm not trying to argue, by the way, that 6NT is a thing of beauty.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|idc: It isn't a great 6NT; even @s coming in for 4 tricks leaves you with some work still to do|pg||

pc|c4|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|barnets: well the heart lead  gives him 12|pg||
nt|barnets: by the finesse against the @H10|pg||
nt|idc: I suspect he may have been a trump short on a @c lead: win A, @hA, ruff @h, trump to hand, ruff out @hK - now in wrong hand|pg||
nt|barnets: I think on reflection he needed the @H lead|pg||
nt|idc: so he plays a 2nd trump to get to hand but now, though he can pitch 2 clubs, he has to ruff losing @h & losing @c from hand and only 1 trump in dummy|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|barnets: without it he could not make the @H8 as a trick|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|barnets: but he still has to guess hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: to make the contarct|pg||
nt|barnets: he is going for a x ruff now|pg||
nt|idc: maybe he could try crossruff line: AQ hearts pitching clubs, & @cA, then 9 trumps separately|pg||
nt|barnets: and can make 9 spades 2hearts and a club|pg||
pc|s8|nt|idc: the @s9 in dummy makes that attractive, just needs 1 low @h ruff & 1 low @c ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: so victor made the wrong lead|pg||
nt|idc: best to win this in hand I think, leave 2 high trumps in dummy|pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|nt|galadriel: Aaahhh Alex - nice one|pg||

mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|nt|idc: One of my favourite conventions - the good/bad 2NT - would help there: 3@h would be a game try|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 6@C on a finesse which succeeds|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: Missed in the other rom|pg||
nt|copeyj: this is a decent vulnerable game |pg||
nt|idc: 10 IMPs to England on hand 8 - agressive weak 2@h got N-S to 4-3 @s fit instead of 3NT|pg||
nt|jtr: It would be nteresting if West had one more @s and one less @d|pg||
nt|Walddk4: lol Victor did indeed lead a heart against 6@S in the othrer room. That's Gerrard's 12th trick and a huge swing to Scotland|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow|pg||
nt|jtr: They take the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Gerrard did not show his hearts in the OR|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's different here, Paterson won't lead one|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Or Short for that matter|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|jcomyn: yes but 4-0 breaks are unpleasdant at slam level|pg||
nt|yo_yo: always galling when you arent in it and the other side are|pg||
pc|s4|nt|golfsquash: 6@c may be better than the finesse, as the spade may go on the diamond and other suits might break kindly.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Strange, in Denmark West was on lead, now it's East. Well, that's what you get when you move I suppose :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Yes, a little bit worse than a finesse - worth being in.|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@S in the other room was "wet" to say the least|pg||

nt|copeyj: just have to show what you have|pg||
nt|galadriel: Definitely|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Yes, looks like an easy cue bid in the other room.|pg||
nt|rednaxela: East is marked with the points, but also with Spade shortage, so the finesse is no certainty.|pg||
nt|copeyj: the finesse on this auction is basically a certainty - 90+% I would say|pg||

nt|yo_yo: East is allowed ( and should ) think at trick 1|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Hard to know if you want the major suit finesses to win or lose|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but the more he thinks the more Michael will think he has K@D|pg||

nt|galadriel: Thanks Stuart - that's interesting - North may have been interested in that case|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 14 imps is the very top of the range for an 18-12 win|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rednaxela: This will excite Waterlow.|pg||

nt|rednaxela: E/W are playing 4 card Majors.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: dont need all that stuff under your legs |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|idc: England 1 were 7 VPs ahead of England 2 going into this match, so any win at all for them will stretch them away|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rednaxela: To my mind that is not worth 4@d but the two learned players in the East seats disagree with me.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: England have lost their first match of the weekend - 13-17 to Northern Ireland|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: An unusual 2NT for the minors from Hackett|pg||
nt|lark20: I thought that would have been obvious|pg||
nt|idc: Ross Harper may not have heard me:  UNUSUAL NT ROSS|pg||
nt|lark20: Now what does Paul do?|pg||
nt|idc: I used to play 1@s p 2@s 2NT as hearts & a minor 2 suited on grounds of frequency and importance|pg||
nt|idc: but this auction isn't quite the same as that one|pg||
nt|lark20: 3C looked such a nice contract|pg||
nt|idc: Is Paul just checking whether 3@h can be a game try here?|pg||
nt|idc: I'm with you Beryl|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I say too high, but 2 of the 3 finesses working might be enough for 6@s, so not unreasonable slam|pg||

pc|cK|nt|rednaxela: The defence will be short and sharp here.|pg||
nt|golfsquash: This is a good game, down on the bad trump break.|pg||
nt|idc: You could argue that any hand with 6 cards hearts would either have bid earlier or wouldn't bid 3@h now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rednaxela: Waterlow knows his partner.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
nt|idc: in which case, 3@h perhaps should be values and game inviting opposite Paul's hand|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rednaxela: The problem is that 4@d commits you to game.  If you have hit partner's strength in a minimum hand then he knows he doesn't want to be in game but has no option.|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D|an|RKCB|mb|p|mb|4S|an|0/3|mb|p|nt|idc: Well, if East has @hA then he should return a @d, so I guess declarer has to finesse before he can test hearts|pg||

nt|lark20: No harm done|pg||
nt|idc: Yup, North's QT of @h meant 3@h played quite well, and more IMPs to ENgland 1|pg||

mb|p|nt|copeyj: normal auction to a normal spot|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|idc: There's a minor flaw somewhere in the OR auction|pg||

mb|p|nt|rednaxela: I sense that the spectators are about 70-30 against me on this!|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|copeyj: it's not like game didnt have play here - it was poor but had play|pg||
nt|rednaxela: It was a counting to 5 problem.|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: For info: the 6 teams (5 countries + England 2, the sponsor's team) play a double round-robin of 14 board matches|pg||
nt|idc: so 10 matches over the weekend, this is match 7 so 3 left today|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rednaxela: Hi, everyone.|pg||
nt|idc: Welcome Alex|pg||
nt|cuttysark: jolly quick play in the Open Room|pg||
mb|p|nt|rednaxela: Holland was quite right to show his Diamonds, but may now be worried that they may have missed a spade fit.|pg||
nt|idc: Similar sequences, with both South players bravely pushing the boat out with 4@s|pg||
nt|rednaxela: This is one of these hands where no-one is quite sure who is making and who is saving.|pg||
nt|rednaxela: silverstone going very quietly.  I must admit I would have fancied something more constructive than 4@h on the previous round.|pg||
nt|idc: North is rehearsing arguements for 3 bids: pass, 5@c & 5@d|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rednaxela: Blackwood as much easier in the old days when you only had to count up to 4.|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Note that Lewis in OR splintered with 4@d - quite a fruity effort with that West hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: W 'you talked me out of it'|pg||
nt|jtr: 3NT now and North must find a move|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rednaxela: Yes, no messing about.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|idc: I've had to do the setup lines & punchlines for my 'jokes' ALex, so be kind to the specs, they have suffered|pg||
mb|p|nt|rednaxela: Now for the diamond ruff.|pg||
nt|idc: Declarer onloy has 3 losers, but trump position too fragile to expect to make this|pg||
nt|lestergold: and he did|pg||
nt|jtr: Well done|pg||
mb|4D|nt|galadriel: Also the upside is that they can get you to a great slam with limited values, if partner has no values there|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 5@C in the other room|pg||
mb|5C|nt|rednaxela: Well 456 of them have stuck it out.  Well done everyone!|pg||
nt|rednaxela: It's hard being a one man double act.|pg||
nt|idc: The second half of this match has been all one-way traffic so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: The bidding doesn't scream South is 4-7 in his 2 suits, not easy for East to give @d ruff|pg||
nt|rednaxela: would also work if South was 6-4.|pg||
nt|idc: This play to last trick is a clue though - if SOuth had 5 spades why not ruff the @h|pg||
nt|idc: But with the fragile 4-3 fit, forcing declarer will result in defeat anyway|pg||
nt|idc: the @d ruff isn't necessary|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: he is deep in thought|pg||
nt|idc: not a trump mind you but I'd be amazed if that is what Tony is thinking of|pg||
nt|idc: joankenny makes a good point - Victor could have played a high @h last trick to ask for a @d ruff|pg||
nt|idc: the h!Q for preference|pg||
nt|rednaxela: True.  Would South throw any Club other than a singleton?  i think that the distribution must be becoming clear.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: half pulled out a club|pg||
mb|6C|nt|copeyj: better in my view to play 1@H-3@S as any singleton splinter, then partner can ask if interested in better things, and if its a game only hand youy dont give the opening leader any ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: inforrmation about where the single is|pg||
nt|idc: nice: if declarer ruffs this he may be going lots down|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well essentially this slam is about 75%|pg||
nt|jtr: Nice auction here notwithstanding what 2@h meant|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe a semi +ve|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rednaxela: This is turning into a chunky swing.|pg||
nt|idc: If South had 2 @s honours in hand & 1 in dummy it would be much better for him|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems to show some values - the key was to appreciate the value of the clubs|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|idc: as it is, if he ruffs low in dummy later the trump suit is blocked & he can't draw trumps|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|idc: and he can't afford to ruff high in dummy|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bid Price says i hav values but no aces so it has to be a good shot|pg||

nt|idc: My fellow commentator Barnet, BBO itself and to specs for preventing us just chatting to each other!|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe scotland will get a few back then|pg||
nt|idc: SOrry, 2@c here was Asptro, so @h and another suit |pg||
nt|idc: That explains South's 2@d - usually meaning fewer than 3 hearts, and North's 3@c|pg||
nt|idc: Presumably Eaqst doubled that for takeout and West left it in |pg||

nt|idc: Welcome to Liz - and now I can boast that after 20 secs of analysis, I agree :)|pg||
nt|jtr: I suppose England2 now have a theoretical chance of finishing 1st|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If the margin remains 26 imps the result will be 21-9, bringing England 2 to 155. But England have 181|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah not enough then|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks better played in a major part score here|pg||
pc|c9|nt|cuttysark: 2NT = weak raise/ Or is it a psyche :)|pg||
nt|rednaxela: A pragmatic but unsuccessful bid by Priday.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|cuttysark: (He's so clever)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rednaxela: Seems to be catching.|pg||
nt|galadriel: Ah it seems 3NT is normal on a combined flat 23 count|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|yo_yo: these hands were obviously played while offline, which explains the speed |pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: Apology for the disruption play in closed room is finished |pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: The next match starts at 13.05 Northern Ireland v Scotland|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Thank you everybody, esepcially the commentators who stepped into the breach|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Next set at 13.05 BST|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rednaxela: In the old days, opening opposite opening bid equalled game values. |pg||
nt|rednaxela: I expect this makes too.  the clock is ticking, Ian.|pg||
nt|idc: That @hJ in the North hand is key - threat in @h needs to be in North hand|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|lestergold: problem with east bidding stayman is they would probably get too high|pg||
nt|jtr: East was very conservative but maybe 1NT was 14-16|pg||
nt|lestergold: a heaviliy duplicated hand|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|idc: since @d guard is over the @d threat in the South hand|pg||
nt|jtr: ah ty Stuart|pg||
pc|sK|nt|galadriel: True - although as opening bids get lighter, allowances have to be made|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Unless you can play them like the Italians.|pg||
nt|copeyj: I would imagine generally Holland-Hallberg play a solid opening style - Hallberg is well known in England for passing hands most of us mere mortals consider routine openers|pg||
nt|idc: Last board of the match, time to thank all those who have made this vugraph possible|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||

nt|Walddk4: All chances gone for England 2 now|pg||
nt|lestergold: whatever the result its an esxcllent board for scotland in any case|pg||
pc|d7|pc|sA|nt|cuttysark: Their style of no-trump bidding is quite careful|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rednaxela: Well Victor has told tony what to lead to make it interesting.|pg||
nt|idc: As both my fellow commentators know from experience, squeezes I can do - it's drawing trumps and counting to 13 that let me down|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: xx = AH|pg||
pc|d5|nt|idc: My fellow commentators Beryl & Alex, BBO itself, and to all of you specs - hope to see you for next session|pg||

pc|c6|pc|d8|nt|jtr: Scots are generally careful with things:)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|idc: Even if @d were 5-1, declarer would have some squeeze chances now - but they are 4-2 so will be quickly flat|pg||
pc|s7|pc|dJ|nt|rednaxela: Victor can ask 'If I hadn't doubled Hearts would you have led one?'|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|nt|rednaxela: Hallberg has done well but couldn't quite bring this one home.|pg||
nt|rednaxela: His reward is 3 imps.|pg||

nt|lestergold: harrods no fun any more since al fayed sold it|pg||
