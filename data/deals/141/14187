nt|rednaxela: Evening, Anne.|pg||
nt|rednaxela: So far England have won all their matches, but England 2 (or the Sponsor's team) are close behind them.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rednaxela: England 1 are in a clear lead, and so far unbeaten.|pg||
nt|idc: Good morning all, welcome to the final day of the Senior Camrose 2010|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|rednaxela: John Holland has been undertaking fact finsing missions to Scotland.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|rednaxela: He recently lost a marathon Scottish Cup final that went to several sets of extra boards.|pg||
nt|idc: Eng 1 on 80 VPs,  Eng 2 on 73 if I can still add|pg||
nt|rednaxela: England 2, more accurately the Sponsor's Team, lie in 3rd place.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|idc: England 2 are the sponsors team, and a pretty good one too|pg||
mb|p|nt|rednaxela: The Patron's team actually won last year's event but are not elligible to hold the trophy.|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk10: Welcome to Oliver Clarke and Adam Magyar|pg||
nt|oliverc: hi everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzmh: Hi wellcome|pg||
nt|galadriel: The 2NT opening means they will play in @H rather than S but 4 of either major is fine|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good Morning, all and welcome to the Seniors Camrose.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|oliverc: hi Ivan|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk10: Last 8 boards of the tournament|pg||
mb|5C|nt|cuttysark: We are a little short of commentators - all welcome|pg||
mb|d|nt|idc: Bernard Teltscher faces an unenviable choice of a major - so he has sensibly let partner speak|pg||

nt|rednaxela: For you perhaps!|pg||

nt|Walddk10: wow tied 1st|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: so a nebulous 1@D from North, but the rest of the bidding fairly predictable|pg||
nt|sundiszno: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk10: Borth pairs play Precision|pg||
nt|Walddk10: Hi Adam|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Ys, most tournament pairs have a way of finding out about a 5 card Major in the 2NT opener, but when they have one of their own they tend to show that.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sorry, Ian, I interrupted you in full flow :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I can hear the specs shout with one voice: THANKS LIZ!|pg||
nt|idc: I forgot you have young(ish) children|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: 2NT shows 19-20|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Had East been 5-2 in the Majors a 5-3 Spade fit could have been missed.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sundiszno: so this can be the final |pg||
nt|oliverc: this should make fairly comfortably|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Good stop by E/W, though slam can be made.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||
nt|galadriel: Although even if you play 20-22, this is probably worth an upgrade|pg||
nt|idc: The defence to 1@hX could have been a carnage but it's a bit double dummy to manage that|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sundiszno: fairly comfortably is a little bit of an axaggeration :)|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||

nt|idc: maybe it was the way I played them|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|yo_yo: i was a bit surprised John Holland didnt double the last contract|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rednaxela: After a 1@s opening in the other room E/W got to 3NT on board 1.  1 imp to Scotland.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: He is usually sharp on  the doubles|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|idc: the alternative for West was 1@s, not an unreasonable 4 card overcall|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|idc: England are currently 28 VPs ahead of N Ireland in 2nd place - they will be tough to catch|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sundiszno: this depends basically on finding @sQ and @cJ|pg||
nt|sundiszno: easiest is to find @sQ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|galadriel: With such a weak hand, Short chooses to lead partner's suit|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sundiszno: but if the defense doesn't attack @hs early, you have plenty of time for even going wrong |pg||

nt|galadriel: perhaps?|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: :) X-ray vision a wonderful thing|pg||
nt|idc: This is an interesting play problem in 4@s|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Brave bid by Waterlw under a lot of pressure.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h7|nt|idc: If Tony can manage an elimination then East might be left on lead with the 4th round of diamonds to be endplayed|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|idc: Yes, it doesn't quite have the look of a push-on-to-5 hand|pg||
nt|rednaxela: He may have hoped for a double fit.|pg||
nt|rednaxela: And found one.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sundiszno: @s now|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|idc: The @h lead makes that more likely|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|rednaxela: I'm not sure. 2-3-4-4 is at least better than 3-3-3-4.|pg||
nt|idc: Of course, he couldn't pass I'm sure, since the 4@h UCB created a forcing pass situation at the 5 level|pg||
pc|c4|nt|galadriel: Well, it's described as "sound" so we can't argue with that|pg||
pc|c9|nt|yo_yo: John has a glimmer of hope|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|idc: I'm guessing that, but most pairs would have that treatmment|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: 4H = splinter|pg||
nt|rednaxela: I would guess that 4@h was a splinter.  |pg||
nt|rednaxela: Christine, was 2@s H + a minor or H + C?|pg||
mc|11|nt|idc: So it was (my eyes aren't focusing reliably at this early hour) so scratch "UCB" and replace with "splinter"|pg||

nt|rednaxela: Thanks.|pg||
nt|rednaxela: So, England 2 strike back.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|idc: Played the other way up in OR, @cJ lead meant a quick -1|pg||
nt|idc: the point still valid - once you have shown game values opposite opening bid, can't let opps play undoubled|pg||
mb|1S|nt|copeyj: Strong NT, 5cM and 3 weak 2s I think (Hi all btw :))|pg||
mb|p|nt|sundiszno: 2@c precision here|pg||
nt|oliverc: 2@C surprises me|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 11-15, 6+ @c, or 5+ @c and 4+M|pg||
nt|oliverc: Normally precision pairs would prefer 1@H over 2@C with the West hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzmh: you leap in @H with shows 6-5 when you open 2@C|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Yes.|pg||
nt|idc: so West's pass over 5@h was at least midly encouraging for East to go on|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|galadriel: Thanks Simon - and Hi :)|pg||
nt|idc: One of the reasons I took to bridge in the 1980s was that play started in the afternoons, unlike chess tournaments|pg||
nt|idc: now that all seems to have changed - a pity|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|rednaxela: A wheel seems to have come off for the Scots in the Open Room on board 2.  With a vulnerable game on they defended a non-vul 2C-6.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rednaxela: Hi, Simon.|pg||
nt|copeyj: On the board before, as I said in private, if 1N was 14-16 I think it deserved to miss a game - you just should not downgrade vulnerable at all imo unless you have an ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: extraordainary reason to which it doesnt look to me like you do on that hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a dangerous double by michael Macdonagh|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: That's on the basis that it's easier to persuade East that you have a 5th Club after|pg||
nt|oliverc: opening 1@H than having a 5th heart once you open 2@C|pg||
nt|rednaxela: I recall that even early afternoon starts gave you trouble some times in these days.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sundiszno: ok, but you must persuade hime you have a 6th also|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: Paterson explained it is 14-16 or a poor 17 count before play|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Agreed. To me that was a normal 17 count.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Usually it shows the other 2 suits|pg||
nt|lark20: esp vul|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I fell a victim to that recently, my partner didnt have the  2 suits he promised|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in fact it cost us the event|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I think 1NT or pass with the south hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and take action when 2@C comes back round to me|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning all |pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|jcomyn: ho9oray|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|dA|nt|copeyj: It was neither of them. It had two four card suits - makes it positively good for me :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|galadriel: Interesting result on board 2 in other room|pg||
nt|galadriel: EW going 6 down for a gain of 8 imps :)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|rednaxela: I'm guessing neither could make a penalty double, but someone had to do something!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|oliverc: I would merely point out that 4@H probably making here whereas 5@C is not :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|sundiszno: and in this hand, even if east had a 3rd @h, 5@c is safer, youdon't get shortened|pg||
nt|idc: Lots of good comments from specs|pg||
nt|idc: That's true, but I prefer to think of it as exceptional time management when I arrived at the table bleary eyed at 13:59|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d3|pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|evtimov: opening 2@C is more aggressive than 1@H|pg||
nt|oliverc: true|pg||
nt|sundiszno: no, you get shortened right after the lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: If you don't play pass as forcing on 2 in the open room then S had to act|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|idc: Another 19 count 2NT (though one or both may play it as 19-21 of course)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: often 5/4 at green |pg||
nt|golfsquash: coffe time, 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
nt|golfsquash: ee|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rednaxela: I'm guessing this must be a Weak NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: 3D = max 4d's likely not 4c's|pg||
nt|idc: I guess the defender's major suits lie pretty favourably for 6NT|pg||
nt|idc: Thanks Christine, that's useful info|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: Waterlow explaining VS made slam try 16 + he accepted it but VS decided not to on|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rednaxela: I would have thought that 2@d followed by 3@d would get East's hand across.|pg||
nt|idc: It looks like Victor Silverstone tried for a 4-4 @c fit as a slam try, ignoring the weak 4 card @h suit|pg||
pc|s4|nt|galadriel: Yes, he might have tried 3|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Pass is rather timid with a 6 card suit opposite a take out double.|pg||
nt|copeyj: this is also a good stop - and in addition a good lead from Paterson|pg||
nt|copeyj: I think N/S play 5cM but Holland chose to open a tactical 4 card 1@S in 3rd (non vul obv)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: draw 2 rounds of trumps and set about the @D?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Englands score is about to soar,  4@S  on board 7 about to make|pg||
pc|s7|nt|idc: I don't mind shading a little for decent 19 counts, but what often happens is people start shading 18 counts too|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|idc: That's not an unreasonable way to do it|pg||
pc|s3|nt|galadriel: Yes, I like that too - lead directing|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|idc: So I guess we've had a puppet Stayman sequence and East is declarer|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|rednaxela: It looks like weak NT was in use in both rooms.  This is the sort of hand where having one pair playing 14-16 guarantees you a swing - of some sort.|pg||
nt|rednaxela: I'm not trying to argue, by the way, that 6NT is a thing of beauty.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|idc: It isn't a great 6NT; even @s coming in for 4 tricks leaves you with some work still to do|pg||

nt|idc: Colin SImpson couldn't tell how the @d suit was lying - South could have had 4, 5 or 6 of them|pg||
nt|rednaxela: It's not just that E/W have 32 points but holding all the Aces and all the Kings they have a lot of flexibility about to play the hand.  At least it is quicker this way.|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|galadriel: Aaahhh Alex - nice one|pg||
nt|copeyj: I would not consider X with the E hand here|pg||
nt|copeyj: the opps have the boss suit, I have nothing, and partner has passed my opening bid|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: One of my favourite conventions - the good/bad 2NT - would help there: 3@h would be a game try|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yo_yo: 6@C on a finesse which succeeds|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|galadriel: Missed in the other rom|pg||
nt|copeyj: this is a decent vulnerable game |pg||
nt|idc: 10 IMPs to England on hand 8 - agressive weak 2@h got N-S to 4-3 @s fit instead of 3NT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|galadriel: So, the first double figure swing|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|nt|idc: and 2NT followed by 3@h is just competitive|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but 4-0 breaks are unpleasdant at slam level|pg||
nt|yo_yo: always galling when you arent in it and the other side are|pg||
pc|cK|nt|golfsquash: 6@c may be better than the finesse, as the spade may go on the diamond and other suits might break kindly.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rednaxela: Yes, a little bit worse than a finesse - worth being in.|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@S in the other room was "wet" to say the least|pg||
nt|copeyj: vulnerable you owe partner a good raise |pg||
nt|copeyj: even nv you owe a good raise|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jcomyn: especiallyh offside|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|copeyj: just have to show what you have|pg||
nt|galadriel: Definitely|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Yes, looks like an easy cue bid in the other room.|pg||
nt|rednaxela: East is marked with the points, but also with Spade shortage, so the finesse is no certainty.|pg||
nt|copeyj: the finesse on this auction is basically a certainty - 90+% I would say|pg||
nt|copeyj: I suppose E could have void @S to justify the bidding|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: two mays and a might rory dont sound good|pg||
nt|idc: Same bidding in both rooms this hand; same result or possibly an overtrick IMP here seems likely|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|copeyj: declarer is not home yet|pg||
nt|idc: If I couldn't make a try, I think I'd just blast 4@h - vul at teams would be too tempting|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|rednaxela: Still some work to do.  Declarer can't simply draw trumps and ruff his losers.|pg||
nt|rednaxela: This isn't the sort of hand England 2 need.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|idc: no overtrick after that trump play|pg||
pc|cT|nt|idc: For England 2, I think a decent win here is essential if they are to catch England|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|copeyj: he can take a @H finesse (@HT) for his 10th trick|pg||
nt|copeyj: i wonder what line he is going to take|pg||
nt|copeyj: there are choices|pg||
nt|galadriel: I think East is marked with a @H suit|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|golfsquash: ok, 6@c is better than 50%.|pg||
nt|idc: Northern Ireland still have an outside chance, but they would need to defeat England big when they play their head-to-head match|pg||
nt|rednaxela: on the other hand, if England 1 put on a good finish they could be almost uncatchable.|pg||

nt|lark20: Now what does Paul do?|pg||

nt|idc: but this auction isn't quite the same as that one|pg||
nt|lark20: 3C looked such a nice contract|pg||
nt|idc: Is Paul just checking whether 3@h can be a game try here?|pg||
nt|idc: I'm with you Beryl|pg||
mb|3N|nt|idc: I say too high, but 2 of the 3 finesses working might be enough for 6@s, so not unreasonable slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rednaxela: The defence will be short and sharp here.|pg||
nt|golfsquash: This is a good game, down on the bad trump break.|pg||
nt|idc: You could argue that any hand with 6 cards hearts would either have bid earlier or wouldn't bid 3@h now|pg||
mb|p|nt|rednaxela: Waterlow knows his partner.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|nt|idc: in which case, 3@h perhaps should be values and game inviting opposite Paul's hand|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|idc: I've had to do the setup lines & punchlines for my 'jokes' ALex, so be kind to the specs, they have suffered|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Now for the diamond ruff.|pg||
nt|idc: Declarer onloy has 3 losers, but trump position too fragile to expect to make this|pg||
pc|hK|nt|galadriel: Also the upside is that they can get you to a great slam with limited values, if partner has no values there|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h5|nt|rednaxela: Well 456 of them have stuck it out.  Well done everyone!|pg||
nt|rednaxela: It's hard being a one man double act.|pg||
nt|idc: The second half of this match has been all one-way traffic so far|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|idc: The bidding doesn't scream South is 4-7 in his 2 suits, not easy for East to give @d ruff|pg||
nt|rednaxela: would also work if South was 6-4.|pg||
nt|idc: This play to last trick is a clue though - if SOuth had 5 spades why not ruff the @h|pg||
nt|idc: But with the fragile 4-3 fit, forcing declarer will result in defeat anyway|pg||
nt|idc: the @d ruff isn't necessary|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: he is deep in thought|pg||
nt|idc: not a trump mind you but I'd be amazed if that is what Tony is thinking of|pg||
nt|idc: joankenny makes a good point - Victor could have played a high @h last trick to ask for a @d ruff|pg||
nt|idc: the h!Q for preference|pg||
nt|rednaxela: True.  Would South throw any Club other than a singleton?  i think that the distribution must be becoming clear.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: half pulled out a club|pg||
pc|c6|nt|copeyj: better in my view to play 1@H-3@S as any singleton splinter, then partner can ask if interested in better things, and if its a game only hand youy dont give the opening leader any ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: inforrmation about where the single is|pg||
nt|idc: nice: if declarer ruffs this he may be going lots down|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rednaxela: This is turning into a chunky swing.|pg||
nt|idc: If South had 2 @s honours in hand & 1 in dummy it would be much better for him|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d2|nt|idc: as it is, if he ruffs low in dummy later the trump suit is blocked & he can't draw trumps|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|idc: and he can't afford to ruff high in dummy|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|s7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rednaxela: Bacl to -1.|pg||

mc|9|nt|idc: You can understand defenders taking a sure quick set rather than a complex line trying for more down|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: some debate|pg||

nt|idc: 28 IMPs to England 1 - but just a glimmer of hope offered here if they can reach 6@h|pg||
nt|rednaxela: A chance for the Sponsor's team to limit the damage.|pg||
nt|idc: 28 IMPs would be 22-8 in VPs|pg||
nt|idc: well, I can understand East doing that but West perhaps might have done better|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Completely.  Always glad to see a way to beat a contract.|pg||
nt|idc: And another potential swingy hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 3 boards left|pg||
mb|1D|nt|cuttysark: 28 imps scores as 22-8|pg||
mb|p|nt|rednaxela: This is the last board of the match, Seniors being deemed not to have the stamina ofr 16 board sets.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|idc: Declarer just needed to set up a long @d in the OR, but look at what happens after a @h lead instead|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: NS got a bit high in the other room|pg||
nt|idc: it can still be made, but declarer must play for red suit squeeze|pg||
nt|cuttysark: After several hours of analysis, I can tell you that it makes on the squeeze..|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rednaxela: K@s looks like a pretty normal lead, though not necessarily the winning one!|pg||
nt|idc: Welcome to Liz - and now I can boast that after 20 secs of analysis, I agree :)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|cuttysark: 2NT = weak raise/ Or is it a psyche :)|pg||
nt|rednaxela: A pragmatic but unsuccessful bid by Priday.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|cuttysark: (He's so clever)|pg||
mb|d|nt|rednaxela: Seems to be catching.|pg||
nt|galadriel: Ah it seems 3NT is normal on a combined flat 23 count|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: these hands were obviously played while offline, which explains the speed |pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: Apology for the disruption play in closed room is finished |pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: The next match starts at 13.05 Northern Ireland v Scotland|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Thank you everybody, esepcially the commentators who stepped into the breach|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Next set at 13.05 BST|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|rednaxela: In the old days, opening opposite opening bid equalled game values. |pg||
nt|rednaxela: I expect this makes too.  the clock is ticking, Ian.|pg||
nt|idc: That @hJ in the North hand is key - threat in @h needs to be in North hand|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|idc: since @d guard is over the @d threat in the South hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: True - although as opening bids get lighter, allowances have to be made|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Unless you can play them like the Italians.|pg||
nt|copeyj: I would imagine generally Holland-Hallberg play a solid opening style - Hallberg is well known in England for passing hands most of us mere mortals consider routine openers|pg||
nt|idc: Last board of the match, time to thank all those who have made this vugraph possible|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|idc: To our flawless Vugraph Operator, BGB representative Sandra Claridge, SBU West District who are running the event, and the sponsor, Bernard Teltscher.|pg||
mb|7C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rednaxela: Well Victor has told tony what to lead to make it interesting.|pg||
nt|idc: As both my fellow commentators know from experience, squeezes I can do - it's drawing trumps and counting to 13 that let me down|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: xx = AH|pg||
