mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|janm:  Welcome back - apparently 4@s made after we all left and now we'll see if the Indonesian EW can equal the Australians and bid 6NT here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it isn't a great slam -- other than the fact that it can be made|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|janm:  That's the most important part of a slam, isn't it :). We don't seem to have the bidding from the other room, so don't know whether they knew what they were doing when they bid it. But it looks as if it's either 3-3 clubs and 1 of 2 finesses, or|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|janm:  4-2 clubs and 2 of 2. But of course they're likely to lead something helpful (a spade?)|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C-1@H;1N-2@D;3@D-3@H;3@S-3N;4@C-6N|pg||
nt|janm:  It sounds as if the bids after 2NT were cue-bids of some sort or other, and they may get to slam purely on momentum|pg||
mb|6C|nt|ahollan1: 3@D looked like possible trump - Sacul could be 4@D5@C or 5@D4@C after 1@D//2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another partnership inference may be that 1N=11-14 and odd shapes are allowed|pg||
nt|janm:  So in the other room, East had limited his hand with the 1NT rebid over 1@h and then felt comfortable bidding a lot afterward. Here East limited his hand by not opening a strong club? so is also bidding a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: now would be bad time to stop|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we don't know what's trump -- i wonder if either/both of the players knows|pg||
nt|janm:  Definitely! 6NT can survive the bad club break but 6@c can't |pg||
nt|janm:  So it may not be clear whether 3@d was suggesting diamonds as trump? But it certainly sounds as if East thinks clubs should be trump|pg||
mb|7D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i did NOT see that one coming|pg||
nt|janm:  Karwur has to know that Sacul is suggesting clubs as trump ... or not!!|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: i think Gill picked right suit to let this make -- but Sacul needed lead to be the 4 or 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: think like declarer --- @C probably not breaking, so need something good in @H which also means need @D3-3|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that seems was to unlikely -- maybe can handle @C 42|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: pulling trump means hoping for @C33 - in spite of lead - or @HK onside AND some squeeze|pg||
pc|s3|nt|janm:  Karwur must have thought diamonds were clearly set as trump, maybe by Sacul's 3@s cue bid after he bid 3@d? and that therefore 6@c was an attempt to get to a grand. But it's hard for me to find a hand that isn't a strong club that makes 7. |pg||
pc|h6|pc|dT|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|janm:  Maybe something like Kx, x, AJxxx, AQxxx. That would need some decent breaks though and it's perfect cards|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was thinking 6@C on AQJxx instead of @DJ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: wonder if partnership would rebid 2N if 2=1=5=5|pg||

nt|henryb:  Hello All|pg||
nt|henryb:  back to 17|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|sybarra: this may be first ones to one nt |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=ART, 9-13 HCP, 4+@H, maybe longer @C/@D/@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome to Al Hollander|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: another set with the "fun" systems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expect a LOT of alerts for NS system   Forcing 1@C, Transfer Openers [aka submarine]|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello All|pg||
nt|henryb:  A partscore battle, with N-S aboe to make 4@c and E-W 2@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: And this time, it's also probbaly the battle for 2ndplace as well|pg||
mb|1H|nt|henryb:  I would expect the auction to start P-P-1@s-some bid showing @h& a minor |pg||
nt|henryb:  wrond again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=NF, ART, 8-11 HCP, 3@H  [maybe min, 4@H]|pg||
nt|sybarra: al,  are e/w playing precision? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Shi-Hou are playing Precision -- i was just typing that Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: for those watching,  this will be a lot of artificial bidding,  |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi everyone welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both pairs at other table also playing Precision variant|pg||
nt|sybarra: only used with experienced partnerships and 400 pages of system notes|pg||
nt|henryb:  The Australian pair clearly do not play strong club|pg||
nt|rodal f: N for the first take out.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: ok maybe only 385 pages|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards -- and some supplementary notes - online under http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Open.aspx|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|sybarra: might N sit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is he bidding  1 nt |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this seems rather high|pg||
nt|rodal f: Teyssier was cold:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: must say I am not a fan of sitting at imps|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|henryb:  clearly 1N was forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid's 2@D bid doesn't seem to fit the explanation I gave -- but i got if from their notes |pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|vugraphzkt: good morning all|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Hi all, gm from sunny bangalore in South India|pg||
nt|rodal f: The web page for the turney: http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Good morning|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|rv: Hi Rodal|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: EW will probably end in 4@s on this one, and should make it unless NS get 2 club ruffs - I guess 5@c is actually better, let's see if West will show his club support to get there|pg||
nt|janm: This auction might get them to 3NT, which would not be a success|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Open Room starts play with board  29 -- so they will see results from us|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure who do bet on here,  defense if @H start I think|pg||
mb|3N|an|alert|nt|henryb:  the two-step probably shows constructive values|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: hi all|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like a save v 5@H|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|ahollan1: we can only peek at their [and any other vugraph table] using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  We do not have an auction, but at the other table West over reached to 4@s and caught a vey bad dummy|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Hyper-agressive bidding by the NZ  north-south in the other room propelled the auction very high, very quick|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 6@d in the 4-3 fit looks OK to me|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 6NT you can make with the right guesses as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: big think by Tony|pg||
mb|6N|nt|janm: Perhaps if W bid 3@c here, E might retreat to 5@c, but West decided his suit was good enough to play in, and with the @h A lead, he'll be right, I think|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this match is 1st China-Taipei vs 5th Japan|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: The auction looks a bit murky, Nunn calrifies it for us|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: ..and in the end they got the outcome they wanted (opps made the last mistake!)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a passive @S lead & East will be very happy|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tejjyid: Thanks for coming...|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sT|pg||
nt|barnets: @DK|pg||
pc|c3|nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
pc|c4|nt|barnets: may have worked|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: likely 300 for NS -- i'd feel good bringing that score back to the table|pg||
nt|barnets: as if east had rufffed with the 9 dec would crash the spade honours|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|henryb:  Nasty breaks on this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is the 1st of 12 matches for Round Robin  2 -- results aren't posted yet from RR1, but the rotation for RR2 is based upon final tally|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pelu: 1nt had been a nice contract - but prob forcing - but even then I would have passed in S (pd is a passed hand)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|henryb:  I do not know why East wanted a club; a heart would have been more useful|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: results site is http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not much fun discarding from the N hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: the Juniors are playing this in 4@CN|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Frank|pg||
nt|frankaus: part score battles are worth a suprising number of imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Sorry was away from table :(  Will record a claim shortly|pg||
nt|frankaus: 6-8 for a double part score swing mounts up real quick|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: 13th @H might have worked well there|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|henryb:  this will drift down one, but slowly. As I have observed before, no one ever goed dowd wuickly|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|janm: NS have a heart, a spade and a club and EW have 5 or 6 spades (depending whether N's spade trick is taken by a ruff or not), 3 diamonds and at least 2 clubs|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kiwi_joker: dummy's diamonds an alluring target - but unreachable|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pelu: Yes 1Nt was F1 - but from a passsed hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Reid could ditch his 2nd @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect their bidding was slightly different|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all - my name is Peter Lund (Denmark) and I will try to help u in this round|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think there was a better line, after the @S pitch Noth's hand can be striped and you can play @H for a guaranteeed 2 tricks|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but it wasn't necessary|pg||

nt|janm:  I don't know, perhaps not.|pg||
nt|janm:  But otherwise it's hard to find a good hand for 7 isn't it? can't have both Major suit Ks and AJ, AQ in the minors|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|janm:  Anyway, a nice pickup for the Australians|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=11-14 so East too good|pg||

nt|ahollan1: RDBL = 3@S|pg||
nt|janm:  Probably RDBL is support. |pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: that's as close to simultaneous explanations from 2 commentators & operator as we're likely to see|pg||
nt|janm:  I hope NS have a clear understanding that DBL can be this sort of hand. I'd have expected fewer spades (something more like a takeout DBL of spades) but it's hard to know what else to bid w/ N's hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzkr: All with the same explanation even!|pg||
nt|janm:  :)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hehe  Jan -- i was just going to say Tobing PASS in other room looks more normal than Gosney DBL|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
nt|janm:  Nice play in the heart suit - Gosney showed the AKQ and Gill the JT, so Gosney could underlead for the third round of diamonds|pg||
nt|janm:  Doesn't matter on this hand, since dummy's fourth spade will soon be good, but it might on some other hand|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|hK|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|janm:  Gill trying to decide whether to lead that third trump - after all declarer was the one pulling trumps. He's seen all of partner's actual HCPs, but probably there's just room for the @s Q, in which case the 3rd trump would help|pg||

nt|ahollan1: missed opportunity, but any plus may be good on that board|pg||
nt|barnets: would hav been a nice try|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi RV:) And welcome. Long time ago.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A easy 3NT?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=11-15 HCP, a) 5+@H  b) 4441@D |pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: this tourney is played in double round robin format with no subsequent play-offs|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: feel free anyone to commentate|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: can W stay in his seat |pg||
nt|sybarra: yes seems so |pg||
nt|sybarra: "stay in his seat" as in pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  6@h is a reasonable contract, needing 2-2 hearts or stiff queen|pg||
nt|henryb:  and no club ruff on lead|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Miller-Stout play precision.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: It's irrational, but I bet Nunn & Hans feel a warm fuzzy feeling inside after the good start|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: wow  last hand Chinese Taipei Juniors 4@C made 5 |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: interesting choices for Shi over 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N, trap pass, 3@C [@H raise], 2@D all seem to have merit|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe tryingn to get the @D suit in before the ht raise |pg||
nt|henryb:  with various conventions of their own, such as this 3@d bid to show a gf raise|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|frankaus: green V red usually a go signal :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes thought he might come in  but suit is a bit tacky |pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is we are in game force sequence here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and protecting against opener having the 4441@D hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Hou pulled out the 4 @s card then changed his mind|pg||
nt|tejjyid: BTW, anyone who wants to jump in and advise me I'm an idiot, do feel free|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: Not sure about 4@H, as Miller still apparently had the K@S to cue|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N is probably a "serious slam try, while minor suit cues would be "courtesy"|pg||
nt|rv: yes cold, @h8 ensures a stopper and only 4-0 @d break offside can trouble this contract|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'll feel like I'm back at the bridge table|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: the more the merrier|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: i expect this will fail|pg||
nt|janm: Looks as if NS can make about 3 hearts (maybe 4) and EW can make about 3 clubs.|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have an easy partscore in clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: Basis system: NS: Precision @c and EW: 5 card major with weak and strong NT (green-red)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: needs the spade lead,   should be -1 |pg||
nt|janm: Let's see if EW can get the spade ruff to beat this. If W leads a high club, E can overtake to lead a spade back|pg||
nt|janm: But on the trump lead I think NS are going to make 4 hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D is a mystery|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tejjyid: what a nice system - pay in 8 card @D fit at 2 level |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no warm fuzzy things running around the table (yet)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|henryb:  I recently saw a study suggesting that with 4-3-3-3 opposite 4-4-3-2  you should not try for the 4-4 major suit fit|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Other room just started to bid Bd 18|pg||
nt|henryb:  Oh? I thought they went back to play 29 and 30|pg||
pc|c7|nt|frankaus: has a chance but its really tough|pg||
nt|rodal f: Safe for a try by 10 tricks now.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|rv: now 10 tricks possibly|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: would have to magically read the club suit I think |pg||
nt|janm: So we've had two hands in a row where the best defence would be to take ruffs.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if i would have been any better off with 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: well it both sounds like they have an ace the DO NOT have |pg||
nt|barnets: i think south should x and north bid 3@C|pg||
nt|pelu: very nice contract if @Hs was running - or even 4-1|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: (imho)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kiwibridge: E figures to be short so playing 9@S there would have been a decent shot|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Nobuyuki Hayashi|pg||
nt|tejjyid: probably a bit early for the warm fuzzy things|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|frankaus: now @C was req|pg||
nt|pelu: I see the point - but how do u know that ps has 4-4-3-2 :)?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am however convinced that it is losing bridge in general to bid game with two balanced hands and 24 HCP|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Wang Zhi-ge|pg||
nt|tejjyid: they like to sleep in|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: Reid checks to see if 2 tricks is enough to beat 6@H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: might he be concerned spade is cashing?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Hello from Hamilton.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: @H lead is bad idea now however |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: Reid might have also been checking backs of cards to see if they match |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: N and E starting taking the bidding cards away before Reid had a chance to X|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told neither NS player is known for being pessimisstic -- @SA not cashing would be way beyond that description|pg||
pc|h3|nt|janm: Of course S doesn't know for certain that the spade A is onside |pg||
nt|pzpp: E-W here just bid to an unlucky game in NT, with almost every card placed badly for them|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rodal f: ? 9 u have. By the @Shook u still have 9 if it loose.|pg||
nt|rv: Check this url http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/Openxtab.html for all the latest standings|pg||

nt|janm:  Gosney might not be happy about that club pitch |pg||
nt|janm:  He could have bid 3@h of course, but surely passing was more likely to gain - if they can't beat 2@s, they surely can't make 3@h (Gill's failure to open 2@h might be helping this inference). I'd think that -2 was a lot more likely than making|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|janm: I confess I'd also open 2@s with the S hand - everything is right - vulnerability, position, spades being the highest suit|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Ino won the senior teams in Bejing.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice to have RV here. All info comes:) Local time here is 0530 but free today:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|janm: Of course now that 2@s has been alerted, it probably showed 5 spades and a 4 or 5 card minor, so wasn't even wrong on suit length, but I think it would be right to open it even if ...|pg||
nt|janm: it was just a weak 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same 1@H explanation as last board|pg||
nt|npcjpn: This year, he plays in open.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|barnets: a heavy 2N|pg||
nt|barnets: with 22 hcp and good 5 card suit|pg||
nt|barnets: n./s would be s well to bid 7N as 6 |pg||
nt|barnets: 13  tricks without club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ok now can e/w find and make slam? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: notes say Newell has 6@S --- i believe the notes|pg||

nt|henryb:  we changed boards all of a sudden|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: the match to watch|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2@H was Mm 2-suiter, weak (youcouldguess, right?)|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: east is marginal for a 4N raise|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Cards are nicely placed for NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @C looks like "single suited"  |pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is W can tell which suit |pg||
nt|frankaus: sys on  here is normal these days with X replacing 21C|pg||
nt|janm: N probably has a good idea that his partner's second suit is clubs and so won't be useful, but it's certainly possible to envision game anyway.|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT on @dQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  2N clearly a @s raise|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: yes and systems on= transfer in this case |pg||

nt|sybarra: yes|pg||

nt|barnets: hi|pg||

nt|pelu: A problem for E - this bidding could in precision be on 11+5|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: hard to believe both red suits behaving favorably -- and will probably misguess both Qs anyway|pg||
pc|dT|nt|frankaus: olmost certainly its @H now that S trans to @S|pg||

nt|sybarra: sorry with 3 @C I meant|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|janm: I don't know what options he had to invite over the DBL (surely 3@s was not invitational). I think S is going to come to 10 tricks, and he'd probably have accepted most ...|pg||
nt|janm: invitations, with maximum values and good spots in both suits|pg||
nt|tejjyid: nothing very frightening about this contract, orindeed 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes|pg||
pc|c3|nt|frankaus: looks to be a playable spot |pg||
nt|friggi: sure it does|pg||

nt|rv: my apologies for the delay, signing in from sunny Bangalore in South India|pg||
nt|barnets: i thnk north will lead a @H|pg||
nt|rv: after 6@d, can North consider an attacking lead?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not much to the play here worst he can lose 3@S 1@D|pg||
nt|pzpp: yes, and the lead helps declarer ahead in the race for tricks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: same strat as the bidding in Board 1|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@d is apparently a transfer|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now makes many|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 10 tricks, next board.|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@c is a non-standard rebid -- and since I do not have the CC handy, I cannot tell you what it shows|pg||

nt|friggi: Hi Syirley|pg||
nt|janm: Miller knows  that the DBL was a little light, so expects W to have only one spade, and takes the spade finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: some kibber (or you Al)  I am still triying to figure out if e/w can handle 6 @D|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|frankaus: 5 imps to NS here|pg||
nt|barnets: dec has not spades from 6@D bid|pg||
nt|rv: if opps don't have source of tricks and just enough values it pays to passive, after 6@h there was a chance for North to consider @c lead|pg||
nt|rv: N-S are close to making 10 tricks in @h strain|pg||
pc|s5|nt|henryb:  ah. I misread the opening bid: a strong club, and 2N probably 11-13 with no 5 card major|pg||

mb|1H|nt|friggi: sure it is|pg||

nt|cascade: and Miller finds himself with a surprisingly good hand for all of the bidding so far|pg||

nt|janm: other for those meanings)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, STR, F1, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: may be too hard to find|pg||
nt|rv: French Polynesia is doing a lot better than New Caledonia in this tourney|pg||
mb|2C|nt|cascade: yes there are various ways|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure about 4@C|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, especially with partner bidding 2NT vulnerable, Miller must wonder if his side has a game|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c tied to hearts and 3@d tied to spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a transfer over the transfer|pg||
nt|npcjpn: looks like Michaels.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: and it is precision  (just not sure which variety) |pg||
nt|frankaus: communications wont be easy |pg||

nt|sybarra: the good news is E (or W) will have to lead something |pg||
nt|friggi: thne 3H then 3NT|pg||
nt|friggi: dbl tr|pg||
nt|frankaus: first 9 is on top then it gets difficult|pg||
nt|friggi: 3NT is cold|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it might get you way too high and also misdirect the lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not agree with 3N: I think that should show tricks, and 2N should show 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|henryb:  that assumes you open 1N with all balanced 15-17|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT here is 6-10, so Why bid 2NT?|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is the only lead to beat 6N|pg||
nt|pelu: No they play 11-14 NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell has extra King for his 1st seat 1@C -- but can't imagine anything other than 3N now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N is discouraging, but since Reid unlimited it is not pure signoff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Liu still has chance to splinter|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: EW have ended in 5@H on  18|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: nice of @D's to break |pg||
nt|barnets: but never bid|pg||
nt|barnets: only -200|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@S0single and force til min 4@H|pg||
nt|rv: I might have opened 1@d and rebid 1n with north hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: Jan tells me she plays the cues the exact opposite way to me|pg||
nt|cascade: the most important thing is that you have an agreement with your partner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 3c for hearts, 3d for spades is the most common|pg||
nt|janm: This time we have a game where the declaring side will need ruffs (diamonds) to make it, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S asks controls   A=2 K=1|pg||
nt|rv: North could have chanced 3@c with enough distribution though suit is not good at these colors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: slam chances looking rather slim|pg||
nt|npcjpn: yes, that's I am afraid of.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he's done it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Chung now has a Powerhouse|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kiwibridge: twin 50's on 18 to Japan for 3 imps|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 4@s, just splinter? or exclusion RKCB?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I hate the pass of 2NT here|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cascade: and the defense have ruffs to beat it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N=3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so the hand with void gets to declare?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: contemplating 5@C opposite @SK and @HA?|pg||
nt|barnets: he also may have tried 3@C over 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 2@h alerted|pg||
pc|h4|nt|janm: Although if he takes the club finesse he's been offered (right you are that the club bid got them off to the wrong lead), he can pitch the diamond losers and then just needs to ...|pg||
nt|janm: avoid a spade ruff (or S needs to figure things out and give his partner one, which may be hard)|pg||
nt|janm: So that will be a third hand that could have been defeated by a defensive ruff |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if so then pass =3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 for @H switch, is it?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|frankaus: a not so obvious @D lead/switch can couse lots of communications problems|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead gets a bit messy |pg||
nt|rv: West opening is post-modern, I like his raise to 2@s with 3 card fit instead of 2@d|pg||
nt|pelu: Wellcome to Martin Johnson from Canada|pg||
pc|c8|nt|friggi: no problem. play for @D 3-3 |pg||
nt|pelu: so 2Nt would be 16-17 (18)|pg||
nt|rv: all of us like to upgrade the hand more often than downgrade, here North hand is clear candidate to downgrade|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: i think in new zealand would be simpler to alert natural bids|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: interesting -- could only do that because of @H10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: glad i'm not at the table -- as declarer i'd go into long tank because of too many possible lines|pg||
nt|npcjpn: nice bidding.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: should be a formality to make it now, wd|pg||
nt|pelu: agree - 2NT is a bid u dont play - either 3Nt or 3@c|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|rodal f: How may HP would u have shoved me by that sequense RV?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|henryb:  because I think you need 3N to show a very different hand: say Ax, xxx, AKQxxxx, Q|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a) @S ruff  b) @SQ @CAK float @DQ c) @SK then ...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: where grant showed four spades is unclear|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 rounds of bidding - just to miss a laydown slam :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: bids being explained|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in my methods north bids 2@S over the tranfer advance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so we can focus on slam bidding rather than game|pg||
nt|pzpp: I think that they play UDCA, just discourage|pg||
pc|s3|nt|janm: Declarer going after those diamond ruffs - but that will probably make it easier for S to realize he needs his partner to have a spade ruff coming, won't it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but as he did not discard a diamond i dont see how defense can go wrong|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told: 1@S = asking bid in @s, 2@D = 5 card !, (2 top) 2@H asking in @h - 2@S no @h-control|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|pelu: but 3@c would prob be X - so...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Thanks PEter, you have precisely expressed my view NT isinv/forc|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|rodal f: Less that 15-17?|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@d ask in @d - 4@C = A x(x)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|janm: I think S has to play A and a spade here, doesn't he? |pg||
nt|cascade: he doesnt have many options|pg||
nt|cascade: he would have been better to not overruff but he didnt know that his @hK was always a winner|pg||
nt|rodal f: tan*|pg||
nt|rv: I presume South would have invited even after 1@d-1@h-1n and N-S would have reached game|pg||
nt|rodal f: than*|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even heart heart beats it|pg||
nt|janm: I don't know, it might be tempting to assume that West was doing the right thing and so it's necessary to play trumps to stop the second diamond ruff|pg||
nt|cascade: that works too|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh maybe not south will be endplayed|pg||
nt|janm: I think he can make after heart & a heart, can't he - lead a spade to the K, which either gets him to dummy or endplays S|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: as long as club ace still in dummy|pg||
nt|janm: If N leads a club now, declarer has to ruff, not win the A, which may not be clear|pg||

nt|cascade: if he guesses the spade|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|an|2+D, 11-17 pts|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|janm:  After 1@d-1@h-2@c, should West bid 2@s (forcing and presumably trying to get to 3NT) or 3@d?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: karwur's hand has gotten better -- how can he show that without forcing to game?|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|janm:  Sacul decided to rebid the diamonds, partly because 2@c would leave so much ambiguity about relative suit lengths - they're very unlikely to play NT now|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ahollan1: splinter it is -- the other guess was 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm:  4@h is a dangerous bid|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|janm:  Ah, he didnt' really make it :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|janm:  Certainly reasonable to suggest hearts with the W hand after having shown a diamond fit and stiff club|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: just 2 problems here that I see|pg||
nt|janm:  Oops - the EW slam bidding hasn't been a thing of beauty (and I was about to congratulate them on bidding 5@d instead of 3NT)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the trick is -- during the comparison, just say PUSH|pg||
nt|janm:  I'd have thought the 4@h bid would keep Sacul out of slam - at least if it showed a willingness to play 4@h, because surely that would mean he had a bunch of wasted heart values|pg||

nt|frankaus: brb|pg||
nt|friggi: but N should never play@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead was key for defense |pg||
nt|janm: very tricky hand, obviously, and difficult for declarer to realize that it was necessary to do the very unintuitive thing of stranding the club A in dummy|pg||
nt|henryb:  is that desirable?|pg||
nt|pelu: no but that their system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- i still don't know best line -- even looking at all hands|pg||
nt|rodal f: One thing is to precume if u show less than u have. An other thing is to show ure pard what u have.|pg||
nt|pelu: I play Cue bids grom a ballanced hand, and asking bids from the other hand  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: either that or initial control responses of some kind|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry they got a bit fast then !|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@d - bit not 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: unfav 1st/2nd = 131-15|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: or 13-15|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|rv: North's hand is close to an upgarde for 15-17 nt range|pg||
nt|barnets: north has a super max and 4@S will make|pg||
nt|rv: some might open 1@c and rebid 2n|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so the asking bids are in a range context|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 1m - 1M - 3NT is the hand u show|pg||
nt|ahollan1: TRF |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Looks like Norths diamonds vs the opps respective hearts and spades in this one|pg||
nt|pzpp: agree, players just think for a long time, then play like zip,zip, zip|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: they do not always show their cards|pg||
nt|rnmalik: np-look what a hand anything beyond 5@C by NS, the trouble starts.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|friggi: play E for High @S |pg||
nt|friggi: let opps play @H|pg||
nt|barnets: i prefer that yes|pg||
nt|barnets: too strong for 1N|pg||
nt|henryb:  North's diamonds do not win the battle|pg||
nt|tejjyid: may be tough to decide though|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: what system for new zealand|pg||
nt|janm: Also hard for N to realize that he needed to play the second club to cut declarer's communications :) (I'm not sure why declarer had played the heart ten though - if he hadn't he'd ...|pg||
nt|janm: have been able to overtake the heart J)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 4@S by E has chances but the bad break should scuttle it|pg||
nt|pelu: no - I am old Acol-player, so distribution forst - that can improve a hand - and then cue/asking|pg||
mb|2C|nt|friggi: @C lead not enough|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you ever super accept with weaker nts?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont play them, so just asking |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was just going to say that Newell COULD have bid 3@H as SSGT super-accept  [short suit game try]|pg||
nt|sybarra: for an older person such as me,  I would have to do too much "re-thnking" of system |pg||
nt|henryb:  Is 2@d a transfer or an amorphous force?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@S ok by 100% hit by the guesses. Might 3NT is better. But....|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT an easy make.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: South will pass here in all likelihood, if he had Inv strength he would have Xed 2@c to set up forcing auction till 2n|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|janm: Can't tell from the auction, can we? 1@c was alerted, as was 1@d. I'd have said we still didn't know from the alert to 1@c, but probably now it was a strong club and negative ...|pg||
nt|janm: diamond - still not certain|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am told precision|pg||
nt|janm: And what was 2@c by East?|pg||
nt|henryb:  West now emerges with 3N?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i started old -- thinking systems has helped me regress|pg||
nt|sybarra: One Kib suggested bidding  3@H over 2@H (4 crd support, xx in @H)|pg||
nt|barnets: so n/s miss a decent game patly as a rsult|pg||
nt|rv: South chose to pass 2@c and subsequently 2@h since he suspected misfit|pg||
nt|rv: at MPs, many of us would act with South hand|pg||
nt|barnets: cant see why south did not bid 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: the latter i believe|pg||
nt|rv: not my choice for 2@c opening if it shows strong hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: still, perhaps theywill explore for 6@D and stop in !5|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sybarra: certainly gave S, someproblems |pg||
nt|npcjpn: Facing passed partner?|pg||
nt|pelu: here my "favorit" convention (when opp play): 1NT F1 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: the mistake was made by N leading @H after overtaking|pg||
nt|sybarra: N was dummy |pg||
nt|friggi: sorry|pg||
nt|sybarra: just "followed suit" |pg||
nt|friggi: dec|pg||
nt|pelu: almost 8 playing trick - and good gamble here|pg||
nt|barnets: at any scoring|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|janm: After a strong club and negative diamond, I'd have thought 2@c would be natural|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not forcing, was passed hand|pg||
nt|pelu: are u sure -they have some support-hands in 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and another challenging hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: easier for us than at the table|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, sure it is|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, this won't make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well i am just saying i dont play it forcing in this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: apparently natual is passe|pg||
nt|pelu: here pd had the cards he need: @S-stopper, help in @H and 3 card @d so the suit is running|pg||
nt|tejjyid: to Nunn, the @H & @C valuesall look wated|pg||
nt|tejjyid: wasted|pg||
nt|pelu: Its a real top-match, Australia no 2 and Indonesia No 3, Taipie No 1|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: natural|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have the balance of points and the spade suit|pg||
nt|npcjpn: at least undoubled:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I don't like a system where West can't show the @D support on this hand though|pg||
nt|pelu: results: http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/Openxtab.html |pg||
pc|s2|nt|rv: good lead giving nothing away|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is one 10 in hearts from a decent game|pg||
pc|sA|nt|friggi: that is nice:)|pg||
nt|janm: The bidding is more interesting than the play on this hand. It's out of our "ruffs to beat" set of hands, just a boring 10 top tricks, 3 losers |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no emotion shown !|pg||
nt|pzpp: facing 3NT, Lin had a big decision to make, his hand appears to be sourceful of tricks, just need a good @c suit and @s control to envisage slam|pg||
nt|pzpp: not sure of their agreement here, is 4NT just a general interest and natural invitation?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: ask about the 3@s bid|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sybarra: playing J to see if he can get accurate count |pg||
nt|pelu: yes missing @H10 not so bad - need a @c-lead to defeat|pg||
pc|s9|nt|pzpp: 3@s could be just a cuebid for @s stopper for NT purpose|pg||
nt|rnmalik: all cards badly placed, other than missing 2Aces, the Q@H.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes opps were asking|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|friggi: this line is better the play for 3-3 @C|pg||
nt|friggi: then|pg||
nt|janm: I'm told that 2@c showed either diamonds or the Majors|pg||
nt|rv: declarer can still mis-guess all suits, generally trump lead is worthwhile if 1 hand is known to be very strong|pg||
nt|tejjyid: IMO, 3@D is mandatory aafter 2@S - assuming it's GF|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|rv: if South doubles 2@C and subsequently bids 2@S it is likely to be forcing, passing 2@c and bidding 2@s should be NF|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rv: South took conservative route since he suspected misfit/bad breaks|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cascade: suction|pg||
nt|pelu: I play 2@S FG, and then 3@D id the obvius bid over 2NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: me to|pg||
pc|d9|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d8|nt|fabsayc: that has the unattractive name of suction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- i think that's what I said Shirley -- but it is not obligatory [especially with min]|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|frankaus: g2g tu all|pg||
nt|pelu: @s3 is not the system card: 1. signal Low-High = even|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: buti once played fit-showing jumps as well, so I couldstart with 2@H|pg||
mc|8|nt|tejjyid: That's a good method, but it doesn't happen often enough to take up a whole bid|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|an|tsf|nt|janm:  I know some people who say there isn't any room between an opening 2M and an opening 1M, so the S hand has to be one or the other, but Gill decides it's wrong for either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not 1@H, not 2@H  ---  i want new system if South hand is a PASS|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|janm:  We are in sync!|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3@C=4+@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm:  It's strange that N didn't super-accept with 4 hearts and a side 5 card suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i should say 3@C INV+|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: but again -- Gill passed hand|pg||
nt|sybarra2: wonder if it playes better from N?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|janm:  I know, he probably promised 15 for 1NT, but once you decide to open something slightly out of range, I don't think it's right to stop showing your hand - and even if his hand wasn't quite worth 1NT, it improved with the transfer|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||

mc|9|nt|sybarra2: welcome Geo |pg||

nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@s or 1?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I think S put his queen of hts in his pocket, even without the @H bid by W |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I thought -2 claim accepted|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I would bid 4|pg||
nt|rv: have the rains stopped in South Island?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: bidding it more of a challenge now |pg||
nt|friggi: not good bid at all|pg||
nt|janm: New Zealand's IMPs came from board 2, where EW were allowed to play in 4@c and didn't make it (so that was a chance for a Hong Kong pickup if they'd gotten the spade ruff to beat ...|pg||
nt|janm: 4@h)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, STR, F1, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL|pg||
nt|rv: 2@c is possibly single suiter here|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: The Hong Kong IMPs are from board 3, where the HK N bid game over his partner's 2@s opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it gets stronger in 3rd/4th|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N makes for 600 against 2@DX for 500|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|friggi: right|pg||
nt|henryb:  So did East: 4@d shows a good 4@s.|pg||
nt|pelu: also my bid - the hand is too weak to 4@D (namyats)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C takes them out of relay mode -- i think|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: meanwhile closed room seems to have gone to sleep|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Hans must have missorted his cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I think Namyats should be a better hand than that|pg||
nt|pelu: CC: just a solid suit - but I agree with u|pg||
nt|pelu: and not "solid" :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  My rules (back when I played it) was no 3-loser suit, and not two suits with two fast losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe DBL is relay -- i'm just not sure :(|pg||
nt|rv: at any other colors, West will gleefully doube 2@d, he is likely to bid 3n at these colors|pg||
nt|pelu: Grant like to bid - but he has no bid|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: is this a slam that is biddable?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is very possible that 3@H=exact shape|pg||
nt|rodal f: The lead at match and team is? not @C but thrumph.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the all seasons double comes to his rescue|pg||
nt|pelu: a slow X = pd my distribution is not OK :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now should pass|pg||
mb|3H|nt|vugraphzkt: nope :(|pg||
nt|pzpp: I think that Mr. Lin had a misunderstanding of this 3@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 3 @D bid not recommended at home |pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe only at home LOL|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|friggi: helps W to count that hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe "we" are on our way |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so YES Shirley|pg||
nt|tejjyid: itsvery disciplined to take 2 passes on that hand; mabe he will balance over 3@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: 3@s presumably Smolen, showing a game force with 4 spades and 5 hearts, so that partner can play the hand in hearts; they know they don't have an 8 card fit in spades already|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what to lead|pg||
nt|janm: 3NT is going to be very difficult to make here|pg||
nt|rv: E-W playing negative doubles and forcing pass till 2n after double by West to set up forcing auction|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Kaz Yamada|pg||
nt|npcjpn: now the lead is very important.|pg||
nt|rodal f: How many have missed how many times there:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: what do you lead from Miller's hand knowing that declarer is probably 4=3 in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 Key Cards + @HQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: but when I bid these,  hts are always 4/1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lucky -- mine 5-0|pg||
nt|ahollan1: AND @S king offside|pg||
nt|kaz08833: hi all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we are toungue in cheek with our comments, folks|pg||

nt|vugraphzkt: no emotion !|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: someone's tummy is rumbling here !|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: seen the hand maybe !|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: i might lead spades as the least destructive|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rv: I like this treatment as well, prefer positive doubles if we have bid a 4+ card suit naturally and on a similar forcing auction|pg||
nt|npcjpn: nice lead.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: another long think|pg||
nt|tejjyid: There's some serious underbidding going on here|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|rv: East-West should time such defenses very well, need to combine punching declarer and remove his trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: if e/w tap dec he will make 4 @D tricks and a club|pg||
nt|pelu: why didn't S bid 3@D ?|pg||
nt|pelu: ven here its a make|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: pity the trumps dont break (just a joke) |pg||
nt|sybarra: yep k off,  I will let you play the 5/0 breaks, and count my blessings|pg||
nt|rodal f: But always 110EW|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|janm: Hard to know what to lead, I agree; although leading a 5 card suit is often right, when it's a bad suit and dummy has 4 of them... So I think he's probably right to try to find ...|pg||
nt|janm: partner's suit, just unlucky that he chose the wrong minor|pg||
nt|barnets: if they dont tap he makes 3@D tricks and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|rv: b|pg||
nt|rodal f: y better|pg||
nt|pelu: I am not sure I would have bid on the East-hand|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this seems to need 3-2 trump and nothing awful in @S|pg||
nt|kaz08833: it will go down 3 at least if E misguesss d|pg||
pc|c3|nt|henryb:  He can make this, I think. @h to Q, @d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Great Shuffler on declarer's side this hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Only the Vul would make me think twice|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|rodal f: @SJ and|pg||
nt|rv: strange play by both West and North|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might vug maded wrong at the @S. |pg||
nt|rv: low @h from dummy could even lead to 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|rodal f: But he/she will come with a correct result.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|gambit: cl already 6 or 7|pg||
nt|rv: min of 9 tricks for E-W|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: big think|pg||
pc|d6|nt|pelu: DD u can make 4@S by playing @D in trick 2 - but then u need to see all 52 cards|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: if you can rely on double promising hearts he made the normal bid|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: one sigh of relief so far |pg||
nt|pelu: NS's NT 1. and 2 : (11)12-14 - 3. and 4. : 14-17|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|rv: here even double dummy, South can't be stopped from making 5 tricks as rightly pointed by Barnet|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: hold breath now for spade |pg||
nt|ahollan1: NZ has won imps on every board so far -- this another likely swing|pg||
nt|sybarra: (that is spades breaking favorably) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: well -- wouldn't be surprised if swing, but 'likely' is an overbid|pg||
nt|sybarra: China seems to be pushing very hard at other table |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|janm: So 3NT will make - it was important to lead clubs, not to start setting up N's 5-card suit, but to take the entry out of dummy|pg||
nt|rv: now 4 down|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: should be -2 now|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it sort of shows hearts and clubs actually|pg||
nt|fabsayc: since with hearts and diamonds you act over 1@S|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: u are right - S will be endplayed|pg||
nt|pelu: or 2-3-3-5|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|npcjpn: NS plays UDCA, so @H8 = discourage.|pg||

mc|7|nt|henryb:  No, He needed to keep that. Now South can rise @dA, cash the @sJ and exit|pg||

nt|ahollan1: thank you Peter|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: gave him the guess|pg||
nt|janm:  Hmm, then maybe 3@d by passed hand is forcing? choice of games sort of bid? Since their general approach sounds like transfers being stronger bid?|pg||
mb|4D|an|=1D|nt|ahollan1: 4@D exactly 1@D|pg||
nt|janm:  You didn't seriously think he'd pass the South hand, did you?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sounds very logical Jan -- it will never catch on :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|geot: Not a bad slam this one, but fails unless you get a heart lead away from the king|pg||
mb|5C|nt|janm:  Hard to stay out of this after the splinter by N - after all if you trade N's hearts and clubs, it's a very good slam.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CQ lead out of turn also works|pg||
mb|d|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|janm:  Gosney now knows the club K is poorly placed, so maybe he will stay out|pg||
nt|geot: Gill will raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: wed|pg||
nt|geot: wd|pg||
nt|janm:  But of course Gill knows his club stiff is good|pg||
nt|janm:  Definitely good decision |pg||
nt|ahollan1: good lesson -- partnership should agree that after the DBL -- one path by South shows @CA, the other path denies|pg||
nt|geot: I am afraid I would have raised:(|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Sacul's DBL paid the price|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: presumably 5@D said @DA but not @CA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|janm:  Although he knew partner didn't have the heart A, and didn't want to bid a slam, so he could sort of visualize the missing heart K and club A |pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|janm:  Sorry, I mean heart K of course!|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|janm:  And in addition, Gill had really shown everything in his hand already, so if partner didn't want to bid a slam, he shouldn't over-rule him|pg||

nt|janm: I was wondering about that too - I don't see how he could have done that, but does declarer really have time to set up a club? Say he leads the club Q, now what? North has better ...|pg||
nt|janm: club spots than declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: note the spade suit play |pg||
nt|rv: strong start by Aus pair in this room|pg||
nt|rv: series of good boards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and that won't be a great result for China either|pg||
nt|rv: steady start by new Caledonia here, no drops so far from bottom placed team in the table|pg||
nt|pelu: a kiwi surrender - never :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: grant said good choice of suit !|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Testing hands.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: good point Shirley -- must admit that i missed the safety play :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=3-10 HCP, 4+@S & 4+@C/@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but defense does not have enough tricks then|pg||
nt|janm: Declarer has 2 spades, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds (if he uses the club and heart aces for diamond finesses), 1 club, he really can't find 2 more tricks, can he?|pg||
nt|rv: no one likes to finish last and lose too many matches, pride of every bridge player|pg||
nt|tejjyid: They were in 4? OK, I take back my underbidding crack|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry missed a bid|pg||
mb|4D|an|.|nt|sybarra: ehaa......for the S bid |pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  2-8 HCP  --  i should copy/paste instead of trying to use recall|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be their system others call it Every, Hand An Adventure (EHAA)|pg||
nt|pzpp: precision 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: not sure|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: nice 4@S for the NZers here (even 3NT makes)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and naturally interesting to watch-no play:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: i think so|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NP, these guys are prety quick, I imagine|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: battle of spades and hts, |pg||
nt|barnets: 3N and 4@S both make here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and 4 @H's always "transfers" to 4 @S (for opps) |pg||
nt|cascade: i just checked double dummy and GIB thinks Miller needed to find the @c8 to defeat 3NT|pg||
nt|janm: Defense might get endplayed out of one trick, but 2? Hard to tell. And of course it isn't easy to lead the club Q either, just easier than leading low|pg||
nt|janm: But GIB lets declarer play double dummy too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EHAA was never this creative|pg||
nt|kaz08833: 9 tricks plaing \s by NS, 8 tricks playing \D by EW|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rv: 2@s seems a gross under-bid here|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: ooops|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: they really needed to find out about the nice secondary fit in @Ds to bid this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes very|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If that tempo reflected the table, I don't think much of it|pg||
mb|4N|nt|friggi: should do|pg||
nt|friggi: ??|pg||
nt|sybarra: well indeed that is true!|pg||
nt|rv: it is normally played as Invitational strength 8-9/10 hcp even with 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Ah, here we see science in action (not!)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well if 2s is minimum is quite reasonable|pg||
nt|sybarra: I only played it in midnight swisses|pg||
nt|barnets: you put the hex on australia|pg||
nt|rv: interesting contract to play and defend, I expect defense to prevail here|pg||
nt|rodal f: -1 and next? but normal bidding.|pg||
nt|pelu: In my book the N hand is too strong to splinter|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North should KNOW what he is doing over a 4@H cue when he bids 4@D|pg||
mb|5S|nt|cascade: 2@s will be minimum|pg||
nt|janm: They got to the right spot of course, but does N really know that his partner can't have enough for 7? Make the diamond Q the club Q for instance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might gain by not helping defense to lead|pg||
nt|cascade: i am pretty sure they dont play 2/1 FG|pg||
nt|fabsayc: remember is precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry there is no commentary here|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: so 2s is definitely limited|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 3@s is not invitational, so pass looks automatic.|pg||
nt|rv: @h ruff or 2@s tricks in addition to 2 tricks each in @hs and @cs|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes precision 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 11-15|pg||
mb|6S|nt|rv: with 5@s and super-max for passed hand, I would have started with 2@h with West hand|pg||
nt|rv: lol|pg||
nt|barnets: as they miss a good game especially on th e bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Even if 2/1 isn't FG, couldn't he at least bid 2@c and then blackwood and tell his partner they had all the keycards and adequate trumps - S would know that AQx of clubs was golden|pg||
nt|rv: commentator's curse as Barnet rightly put it:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if lead is fourth best, start looking elsewhere|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: can even be 2 down now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|tejjyid: and SOuth does not have enough to bid over a signoff, IMO|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: there is no elsewhere but you do look|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|janm: Of course he doesn't have that, but he could have|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my last Regional event on East Coast I came in 2nd in Masters Pair with one of the Authors of EHAA -- Eric Landau|pg||
pc|c3|nt|janm: Or a sixth spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: were you playing that system?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: better J to kill @HK as entry for the 4. @d|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|pelu: I would never lead @D against 3NT - normal a @H and have @DA as entry or a shot in @S|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: all true but sometimes no science is better|pg||
nt|rodal f: @H10 drop auto. Can't miss 7 tr.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d2|nt|henryb:  I think a @h is standout. not that it makes a difference on this hand|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe west should bid 3@S|pg||
nt|barnets: over the X|pg||
nt|rv: NS missed an opportunity to take a @h ruff followed by another @c ruff with @SK to come|pg||
nt|rv: now only 1 down with @HT coming down|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed defense is playing hand for declarer|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kaz08833: S might guess /s wrong|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good approach.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d5|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|janm:  Come on Al, what's 2@h?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it shows the values for 2@H in this auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i used to get in TONS of trouble giving that explanation when i was a teen|pg||
nt|vugraphzkr: 2@H = 5+@s|pg||
nt|janm:  Ummmmmm with a stiff heart? It has to be artificial, doesn't it|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hehe  Amanda confirms my guess of Transfer|pg||
mb|4H|nt|geot: Trumps must be 3-2 (or singleton Q) in 6@S. And they are lacking one key card and the trump Q in a spade contract.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|geot: 6@D is better|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: 6@D has more chances than 6@S -- but Geo got there first|pg||
nt|geot: :)|pg||
nt|janm:  Definitely 6@d is better, since you can try to drop the spade Q and if that doesn't work take the club finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzkr: once again NS are scrambling to find enough PASS cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm:  So it's probably a slam you want to bid|pg||
nt|sybarra2: they can borrow the opps pass cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzkr: they have|pg||
nt|sybarra2: LOL|pg||
mb|6S|nt|geot: In 6@D you may play for the drop in spades, and if the Q doesent come take the club finesse. |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i kibitzed a hand bid by Marston-Burgess where BOTH opponents ran out of PASS cards -- and MB had just barely reached 4-level|pg||

nt|pelu: 4@D or 4@s by West?|pg||
nt|rv: I intend to drive to game in any case and in my opinion 2@h gives more flexibility|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 3h is not my choice|pg||
nt|fabsayc: unless specifically agreed as a weak jump|pg||
nt|pelu: agree - bidding direct on Multi sh show a better hand|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|janm: I suppose there could be QJ in front of the K and A over it, but I don't think bidding scientifically will make it any easier for them to find that|pg||
nt|cascade: they have another chance to showcase their slam bidding|pg||
nt|pelu: see NSs problem after 4@s|pg||
nt|henryb:  somewhat difficult to get to 6@h-- maybe less difficult when West chooses not to open a large number of spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can blame the layout for EW at this board.|pg||

mb|2N!|nt|janm: Or is 6@c okay too?|pg||
nt|cascade: do they need to|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@C=ART, 5+@D|pg||
nt|barnets: not best|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D usually 2/3@D but ....|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@h = 4+ HCP|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|sybarra: but can W lead a @D easily|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6c is better|pg||
nt|pelu: ok a bidding: 4@s P P 4NT - then 5@C (or 6@C) by N and 5/6@D by S = 2 siuter in red|pg||
nt|sybarra: may not be best spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell had option to bid 3@C showing MAX with longer @C|pg||
nt|barnets: Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: South's action is surely too timid though it is hardly clearcut to bid at 5 level|pg||
nt|barnets: would show  the @HA|pg||
mb|3S|nt|cascade: anyway the answer was yes easily|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@D likely down if diamonds 4-1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@C would still have chances|pg||
nt|kaz08833: with other Q N shd pass it's unfortunate judge by N|pg||
nt|rodal f: Auto @S hook and a 50% @D hook for 10in @S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps but they have bid my multi suit a few times, and i am still spending the winnings|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: the slam was NOT found so 13 well earned imps to CT|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: I kinda blame Stout a bit here .. he has chance to bid 3@C, which would have pushed pd's buttons (and they would never defend 5@Dx then)|pg||
nt|rv: I would pass 2@s with West hand, no Invite with 7 hcp, bid game only if partner super-accepts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i was wondering how that 3@H bid would backfire|pg||
nt|pelu: in US and ? canada - the defense against Multi is not so commen as in Europe|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: might see china gain some imps here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: slams all make with @S Qx in North|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: with the opening bid,  not easily |pg||
nt|ahollan1: that brings up point of extreme trivia - i was given URL that explains origin of "schneid"  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061024124644AA8yaYF|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|janm: I assume all of this was natural after 1@c and 1@d, and 3@s is some sort of attempt to find NT|pg||
nt|janm: 6NT won't be a success|pg||
nt|henryb:  Would North's pass be forcing? I do not think so. And North could have much less, say AKJxxx in clubs and out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: where do we locate BBO|pg||
nt|pelu: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: oh is this blackwood|pg||
nt|rodal f: At the -edge for W but...|pg||
mb|4S|nt|janm: Surely if N jumps to 6@c, S should let him play there |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would have bid 4@C over 3nt|pg||
nt|janm: I think 4NT is just a quantitative slam try, not Blackwood|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club queen has to be a big card|pg||
nt|cascade: south did well to move with no aces|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, but S seems to be thinking along NT lines, also if he bid 4@c wouldn't that make it sound as if 3@s was a cue bid?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Took it out.|pg||
nt|rv: West should surely pass 3@s after his invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: well done|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure Herr exp a better hand by partner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have to fight everytime to play it live, mostly recently last weekend|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if theat 4 HCP is 2 Q's, East can stop here|pg||
mb|4N|nt|fabsayc: i liked the unscientific auction better|pg||
nt|janm: Of course, N has a minimum and a void in partner's suit, so even with that nice 6-card suit and 3 aces, it's not unreasonable for him to pass|pg||
nt|pelu: here in denmark even "the old ladies" play Multi :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the final ruling was the event strength of the weakest team was over 8000 master points so multi allowable|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i swear this is true|pg||
nt|fabsayc: as opposed to my usual embellishments|pg||
nt|pelu: I trust u - and here we find that atitude vert strange (mild expression :))|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: big think and sigh|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: Stout does have spade stoppers but the @sAK and the rest of his hand are also suitable for slam|pg||
nt|janm: This one wasn't really very scientific either :)|pg||
nt|rv: he has bid his hand to the hilt by showing 5@s and 8-9 hcp|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 4NT quantative, I assume, so Nunn can cue@C |pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|5S|nt|ahollan1: final scores for Round Robin  1 are posted -- http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/Openxtab.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: I exp that @s are trump (4@c = cue bid with @s)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: By non vul u are so right RV. At vul I would bid 4 100 by 100 times after 3@S from pard|pg||
nt|rv: he can make this contract if he guesses everything correctly though|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2NT might a bit hard from Brison, but his pards problem.|pg||
nt|rv: needs to avoid double finesse in @s which he has successfully negotiated, next needs to play @cs twice towards dummy and then guess @d diamonds as well|pg||
nt|tejjyid: hmmph|pg||
pc|h2|nt|janm: This is actually probably a hand that would be easier to bid in a natural system - N would start with 1@c and later be able to show a good hand.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: China began RR2 in 4th, NZ 7th|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grant-Ker did get to 4@H on previous hand|pg||
nt|pelu: but the 5@d bid I have no expl - even a guees|pg||
pc|h4|nt|barnets: intersting on a diamond lead|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cascade: well they get to a similar situation after 1@c 1@h; 2@d 3@d ...|pg||
nt|janm: So making 5 or 6 depending on whether they cash the heart A now|pg||
nt|henryb:  in which case South might go down at the five level when the opponents were down in 4@s|pg||
nt|rv: well defended, still could be a loss since 5@d makes for NS|pg||
nt|barnets: to see if dc could make it|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I canot fathom 5@D - 0 Aces in 1430?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|janm: Somewhat similar I suppose, but the S hand would have shown a better hand at that point and N could then bid 3@s to pattern out. I don't know, I just hear comments about how much ...|pg||
nt|janm: easier some hand would be in a strong club system so often, I can't resist when it doesn't help at all and might even hurt|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: could not afford this line|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now spade 8 setting trick|pg||

nt|janm: The reason I think the strong club might hurt on this hand is more psychological than real - N starts out thinking he has a minimum and doesn't revise that idea|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the vague 3s and 4nt did them in|pg||
nt|janm: Another void opposite partner's long Major!|pg||
nt|cascade: he is minimum until he finds a fit|pg||
nt|cascade: then he has a very slam suitable hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: My guess is N/S feel good about their game, but not as good as it  will score up |pg||
nt|rodal f: So after the board: That was not as I would have done it. If E goes dow. And WD if home:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: internet connection a bit slow here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so slam is at best 50%|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: on @d lead, declarer pitches a @h, draws a round of trumps and plays a @c out|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ino need to pass I feel, it usually goes wrong when you bid with that and Q@S was a good trump|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: wow - some interesting deals today|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I know, but I just think that it's easier to recognize that if you start out thinking you have a lot in reserve for your opening bid :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Li-Liu in 10@C on  24|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 1 @S is transfer opening again |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=ART, 9-13 HCP, unbal, 4+@D, not 4+@H/@S a) 6+@D  b) @D & @C [maybe longer @C]|pg||
nt|pzpp: an easy 4@s?|pg||

nt|vugraphzkt: S is thinking !|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: still counting his pts !|pg||
nt|pzpp: S thinking? they play Precision, partner's 1@d bid may have no great length to boast about|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cascade: yes he is rewarded with another 6430 - what are the card gods saying?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=@S    go figure|pg||

nt|barnets: right|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: late alert|pg||

nt|vugraphzkt: yikes|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: precision auction here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: playing with house money|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I think we had a discussion in another match about rebidding 2@h vs 2@c on hands like N's - what do you both think (you know what I think)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@H-4@H|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rv: is 2@c right bid? is strong hand transferring here?|pg||
nt|barnets: australia running away now|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|janm: I think you're about to get the prediction prize for the match!|pg||

nt|tejjyid: time for a quick coffee. On that lead, this will make buckets|pg||
pc|dT|nt|cascade: NZ gained another 11 IMPs on  5 when Grant Ker found a good 4@s dive which went undoubled!!!|pg||
nt|rv: ah this makes more sense|pg||
nt|kaz08833: NS only have to take 6 tricks or even 7 because EW can make 4@s|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: and a std. @S lead |pg||

nt|fabsayc: kind of like paying to see the hidden cards in poker|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzkt: brief flurry of action|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cascade: but i typically bid the six card suit unless there is a major disparity in the suit strength|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually defense could slip and allow down 1|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s system should not be tried for novices....  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and isn't even almost allowed in ACBL|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I do not know a defense to it|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe defense is just bid your longest suit |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Hou is examining the system card|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the "down unders"  (Aus and NZ) have always been "creative"  |pg||
nt|pelu: yes - not my style - but on the other hand - I dont like to see a long relay-bidding by opp|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rv: this should get beaten|pg||
nt|babs59: of course, I've just noticed his name showing as Paul Gill, but it's Peter Gill, and he's my brother|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: probably thinking S lead from kxxx|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe he should duck the @D|pg||
nt|barnets: another @D|pg||
nt|barnets: knocks out the ace|pg||
nt|rv: yes that would be a good deceptive play especially at trick 1|pg||
nt|barnets: and if east plays a third @D dec is home|pg||
nt|barnets: and in the newspaper too|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cascade: Michael Lawrence had some advice for 6=4s which i read many years ago|pg||
nt|janm: I think it's automatic to rebid the 6 card major with a relatively weak hand, but I've been told that's old fashioned :). Glad to hear some support|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|henryb:  Not the Acol I know. that is weak throughout|pg||
nt|rv: has a very good chance of working especially if West returns @D3 which may be difficult to read|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: welcome to Pat Anderson, USA|pg||
nt|fifee: ty Shirley :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not enough trumps to take the rest|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: maybe down under= upside down  |pg||
pc|d4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does that mean in NZ i'd be a morning person?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h4|nt|cascade: his advice was with 6=4 rebid the suit with the most high card points|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe |pg||
nt|babs59: board 7 where Gill and Gosney missed game, OR  West opened 1S and passed partner's 1NT response (surely forcing?)|pg||
nt|babs59: so it was a flat board|pg||
nt|rv: declarer should have possibly cashed 4@cs instead of playing 3rd @d|pg||
nt|rv: that would have forced West to make 2 pitches and he might have got it wrong|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any are long at @H it's W. Play @H for the Q|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: perish the thought|pg||
pc|d6|pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: or an all night person?|pg||
nt|rv: now if North cashes 4@s, West will be in some discomfort|pg||

nt|janm:  Unlucky for Nunn in the other room that a low spade lead gave away both a spade trick and a lot of timing|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=11-15 HCP, 6+@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or direct link for Open Results  http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/Openxtab.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: Almost a slam again...or in fact an ok slam here, but fails.|pg||
mb|2D|an|relay|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D Relay -- 2@H=@H [go figure]|pg||
nt|janm:  Slam needs clubs 2-2 (or maybe stiff Q with the heart K onside)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually a lot of Precision Pairs  now playing that 2@H response as EITHER 4@H or 4@S|pg||
mb|2S|an| |mb|p|nt|janm:  But it's probably hard for EW to find out that the hands fit quite well (although obviously it would be better if W had the heart K instead of the spade Q)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and they would use 2@S to ask for WHICH major|pg||
nt|geot: Yes, it is a bit tough. If the trumps had been without a loser there are additional chances to the K of hearts onside, isnt it?|pg||
nt|geot: the J onside|pg||
nt|janm:  If clubs are 2-2 I think it's just cold - pitch one heart and ruff one|pg||
nt|janm:  If the club Q is stiff, you'll usually need the heart K onside (might be able to ruff the heart even then on some lies though)|pg||
nt|geot: Squeeze chances too...anyway, But they will most likely not be even close to slam. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: scary if this delay is Sacul trying to remember his correct response to 2@S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|janm:  I don't think that E has any way to show the stiff @d, which is what makes the W hand have decent values|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: maybe he just did!    6@C 4@H 2/3@S|pg||
nt|geot: I am not sure the previous slam was much better, played with spades as trumps. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but we don't know what 2@S or 3@S really showed/asked|pg||
nt|janm:  An alert spectator notices that maybe E could make 6@c by ruffing 2 diamonds and a spade in hand then putting S in with the third club to lead away from the heart K - probably not a likely line of play though|pg||
mb|4C|nt|geot: But a slam that wins is a good slam, isnt that the saying?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|geot: I think the alert spectator is right....wd:)...but cant see that line is the best|pg||
nt|janm:  It's hard to know what they've shown or whether there might have been a better way to bid the hand when we don't really know their methods|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no a slam that had a chance but went down is a good slam -- a slam that makes is a great slam|pg||
nt|geot: No|pg||
mb|5C|nt|vugraphzkr: Gosney and Sacul having serious language problems|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|geot: it will still be five club tricks, three spades, one diamond and 2 hearts = 11|pg||
nt|janm:  It sounds to me as if West is back-pedaling, but last time I thought that they bid a grand, so I could well be wrong|pg||
pc|d3|nt|geot: anyway, why all this talk about slam....it ends in a "boring" push:)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||

mb|p|nt|janm: Well, he pushed them one higher, so I guess he was right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe double|pg||
nt|barnets: do the top 8 play off or top 4?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you can guess I play few partscores|pg||
mb|5C|nt|janm: But DBL should surely suggest some club length, shouldn't it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2d suggests better diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double allows for 1nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D/@H are Transfer Preempts -- only 3@C is nat pre|pg||
nt|babs59: Paul Gosney has also qualified for the Australian Under 26 team - which meant that for NZ PABF he has been replaced in the team|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: True, but I'm afraid the doubleton club would keep me from doubling - I think I'd end up being a chicken and passing - maybe bid 1NT?|pg||

nt|janm: Once upon a time, I doubled 1@d with 4441 (in that order). My partner waited until the 4 level to bid his 4 card club suit!! Taught me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so i think here double suggests some diamond length|pg||

nt|ahollan1: we had plethora of 8 & 9 card suits at beginning of week -- this is first one in a few days|pg||
nt|janm:  Will Gill pass this or bid 4NT to play in a minor (unless 4NT would be natural)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at these colors -- PASS seems like best chance of plus score|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|geot: Yes, but this is not so easy pass for Gill as it is for us, seeing all the cards. wd Peter.|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h6|pg||
nt|janm:  Lots of different ways to play the DBL of 4@S, but most play it as showing values, not necessarily a perfect takeout shape, but not penalties either|pg||

nt|janm: Hopefully 3@d showed both diamonds and a minimum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N would have been 13-15 unless partnership doesn't allow 5422|pg||
nt|babs59: in 2011 the PABF will be held in Macau|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh, i thought he passed|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cascade: 5-4-2-2 equal minimum - you have to have some standards|pg||
nt|henryb:  although 2@s would certainly work out just fine as a contract|pg||
nt|pelu: @c-lead - normal here - dont work - there are 5 @S-tricks|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cascade: that is what is commonly played|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c/@d = minimums|pg||
nt|janm: Now is 3@s forcing?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not to me|pg||
nt|cascade: and 3@h/@s = maximums with @c/@d respectively|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but then i dont open this crap|pg||
nt|cascade: lets hope not and they have discussed it|pg||
nt|janm: So Miller has shown a minimum, will he decide it's good enough to raise if 3@s isn't forcing?|pg||

pc|d9|nt|vugraphzkt: sorry a bit sleepy after lunch :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|janm: Probably N could have bid 3@s over 2@h to invite in spades, so maybe this should be forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: I know I do not play their system since that is not a neg X for m |pg||
nt|sybarra: for mi|pg||
nt|rv: Double of 2@c by West is t/o and need not have extras|pg||
nt|pelu: 480|pg||

nt|janm: The 2@h bid did keep EW from getting to too many hearts :)|pg||
nt|cascade: there are lots of ways to bid spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Shirley -- you mean Hou's DBL?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I would not X with that hand |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|rv: many experts play this treatment below 2M level after 1M-1N-(2X by opps)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: generally, of course, thinking is a good idea|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: (or a beer) |pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: negative dbl with 4+@H -- what's wrong with that?|pg||
nt|rv: double above 2M level on 1M-1N-(2/3X by opps) is still t/o with extras (15+)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: There are about 8 rounds left; it all finishes on Sunday afternoon (NZ time)|pg||
nt|pzpp: another successful contract is 3NT on board 26, with 3 overtricks:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yep-overlooked.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: or rather that was being played at the time of my observation:)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|cascade: Lau was undeterred by the hearts sitting over him|pg||
nt|janm: Now, can he make this? Or rather, will he? I'm sure he can double dummy|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR - where NZ has a very strange system - they never found the @s-suit and they sold out to 5@c - NO X in board 10|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H showed spades i believe|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on board 10 open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: that was helpful|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|janm: Or maybe he can't if E puts the diamond K up on a lead towards dummy |pg||
nt|cascade: i think he has to lose at least one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: first off, it is only a 7 count,  pard never knows I have 5 hts.  and never knows to bid them |pg||
nt|rv: North should have surely competed to 3@c|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. As a spec told me 1-4     4-1=28.3%|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the problem was they had no idea whose hand it was|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a common problem when you open very light|pg||
pc|c7|nt|friggi: do you agree?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can handle any minor suit rebid from partner too|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|janm: Of course N doesn't know he has spade losers, so is just trying to lose a trick in each side suit and ruff the second club loser|pg||

nt|rv: North-South pair not very experienced and probably over-awed by occasion|pg||

nt|vugraphzkr: Gill asking loads of questions|pg||
nt|janm:  Gill clearly thinking about 4@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Namyats [Stayman spelled backwards]  uses 4@C to show good 4@H opener  and 4@D to show good 4@S|pg||

nt|barnets: 6-8 weeks from end feb|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the ill bid and fated 3N brings a welcom 7 to Japan|pg||

nt|rnmalik: agree-@D lead difficult but not impossible.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: P=0-9 or less than 3 controls|pg||
mb|4H|nt|janm: I'd think Miller would want to bid 2@h to keep West from an easy 2@d bid; wonder why it took him so long?|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@d is certainly a reasonable contract: needs no @d loser or the club finesse and decent breaks|pg||
nt|babs59: Peter's bidding is very straight forward.  I managed to play a tournament with him last year - our first game together in more than 30 years!|pg||
nt|pelu: here a better overcall against 1@c - and in green|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: i would x as south|pg||

nt|sybarra: sometimes you just have to hope for the best|pg||
nt|friggi: if dec do so % is very much in his favour|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb:  but their best result is to double 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Lui hesitated|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Liu|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kiwi_joker: 2H might be hearts and a minor, 3H now showing a "good" weak hand with hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|pzpp: now, 3@d transfers to @h, wrong place to play the @h contract for more than 11 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: deep think|pg||
nt|tejjyid: time for another coffee|pg||
pc|sA|nt|janm: 5@d is an awfully big bid! I know he has a stiff heart, but surely his partner knows it too, since he's heard the opponents bidding|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Jeff may duck a round of spades here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Should be a easy play.|pg||

pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: was just going to say  not sure if Puppet :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|janm: And even though 2@c was in competition, it should show something, shouldn't it?|pg||
nt|cascade: considering he already stretched to 2@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator alerted for me!!!|pg||
nt|barnets: and all gone minus in 4@C|pg||
nt|rv: inexperience/fatigue showing in Macau's game, it happens to all if you are playing long matches and superior opposition for the first time|pg||
nt|barnets: but thats not the point|pg||
nt|babs59: I feel more like Peng is remembering his 800 - which should have been put aside the moment it happened|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: Thanks Amanda!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so no winning defense, both games depend on hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: but even on a small @C decl can have 9 tricks finding @HQ = 8 in Major|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: np ... 1st time I knew what they were doing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H9 might have been Rusinow -- promising @H10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either way -- my $$$ on defense|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: bad luck for W - but with @Ds 2-2 or 3-1 4@S X = 500-800|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think he thought about ducking might have been best |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C will be very successful choice here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CAce that is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and actually -- then there are 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no @H duck because didn't want @S shift|pg||
nt|sybarra: well its the 5/3 suit |pg||
nt|tejjyid: some reason to downgade (singleton @H) - IMO offset by good intermediates|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kiwi_joker: LOL ..and gets a reward with his 8 scoring!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: oops|pg||
nt|pzpp: 5@h must deny control in @d, with which West will have a convenient cuebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: do i lead my ace ?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rv: Macau is doing reasonably well, 8th place |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no|pg||

nt|rnmalik: sigh of relief.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: S not happy|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: bravo|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kaz08833: to make 4@h E must play @s now but playing 3@h trump is reasonable|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s8|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|janm: Surely not? after the 2@h bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@D would have been a lot better opposite at least one club|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: the winning heart play is both correct initially and on the bidding|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Liu's 2@H was an underbid|pg||

pc|c7|nt|kiwi_joker: If he's got 'count' in clubs from Tony, Sartaj should know to take this trick|pg||

pc|d9|pc|cT|nt|janm:  Surely knows where the A is, so leading towards his hand solves that problem|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|janm:  Now it looks like -2 again|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was overruff necessary? what if discard @S?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|s9|pg||
mc|8|nt|ahollan1: maybe Gill gets endplayed in trump then|pg||
nt|ahollan1: -100 very good for Sacul|pg||
nt|janm:  I think so, as long as Sacul reads the position right|pg||
nt|vugraphzkr: Gill has apologised several times to his p|pg||

nt|fabsayc: i missed that magic|pg||
nt|janm: I don't think that really made|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: it did|pg||
nt|janm: How?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: to say Newell-Reid have had a good set is quite an underbid|pg||
nt|kaz08833: dbl then 2@s or 3@h shows E's hand precisely|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however declarer should have made an overtrick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh he did so low club saves the overtrick|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: that was lucky|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very lucky indeed.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: possible if defense never lead trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|alchilds: yes|pg||
nt|friggi: 2@S pass out|pg||
nt|cascade: the play showed declarer leading trumps|pg||
nt|pelu: in Board 8: taipei in 7@h - and lost @DQ - West had also open only 1@S - with a 4@S-opening more easy to find @DQ - but diff to bid 7 :)|pg||
nt|rv: traditionally Chinese Taipei and Indonesia were top teams in Zone 6, now it is very competitive with China, Japan etc making rapid strides in world bridge|pg||
mb|2H|nt|friggi: risky|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=ART, 9-13 HCP, 4+@H, maybe longer @C/@D/@S|pg||
nt|rv: China is arguably the strongest team in whole of Asia (Zone 4-BFAME, 6-Far East) now|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: This is a real blind spot by Jeff... he should just have continued @Ds ..after that good fortune in the spade suit, he had 5@Ds, 3@Ss and a club for a certain 9|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 2 tricks in the play and 7 back to CT on 23|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good situation for transfer advances|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Well, apparently he somehow made it and now we get to see the Precision 2@c in action|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=F1 , 4+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=a) 5@H(332)  b) 4441@S c) 2452 d) 1453|pg||
nt|barnets: multi 21D|pg||
nt|rv: some play lebensohl from North hand on 2@h by West|pg||
nt|barnets: south better not pass|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and we see them, 2@H a constructive spade raise|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: and not wasted values here |pg||
nt|sybarra: well maybe the q of @D's|pg||
nt|friggi: right, freindly layout and lead as well|pg||
nt|cascade: a subdued Miller and Stout here should win back some IMPs|pg||
pc|sT|nt|janm: Yes, surely he'll make at least 3 :)|pg||
nt|cascade: or rather too much aggression at the other table to wind up to 5@c|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we may play it here also |pg||
pc|sK|nt|barnets: now 4@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well maybe, could simply be a cue raise also|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|friggi: friendly|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well forget that statement|pg||
nt|kaz08833: i guess the score is almost tie because Japan will gain another 8 on bd 25|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same bidding so fare|pg||
nt|pzpp: seems that NS plays negative free bid|pg||
nt|tejjyid: @D Q now, for fun|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|barnets: I like 4@H - 5@S|pg||
nt|pelu: best defense against 2@S is to lead @S4 - but in CR East - absolut normal - played @S A K 4 ( and stole his pds @SQ)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|henryb:  6@s looks like a much better contract|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@S|pg||
nt|npcjpn: on this hand, NS can make 3NT, but no way to reach..|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@D was different|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: 3@H confirming 5@H along the way to showing max 1N|pg||
nt|rv: yes good auction|pg||
nt|rv: is Peng's 4N quant here?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully no one leads trumps too soon |pg||
nt|janm: I think a 3@c rebid with the N hand was what pushed them too high - it just has too much in the short suits and too many quacks|pg||
nt|babs59: the other table started with North bidding 2@H - both majors, weak|pg||
nt|pelu: almost for first time EW stepped wrong - down 200/300|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the old surround play|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: in college we defined  Down 1 = Good Bridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- i was enrolled in college   no - i didn't go to class as often as i went to bridge table|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL  |pg||
nt|sybarra: but we made it thru right?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after a mere 16 years|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i made LM in decent time|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: Normaly trumh would been the best lead, but E want W to lead that color.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rnmalik: sorry-some connection.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: some of us "dashed" thru faster than that,  but my father who often was nice enough to pick my up from school always knew where to find me |pg||
nt|rv: I suspect not though it could be for many other partnerships since fit is not found|pg||
nt|barnets: ok well done|pg||
nt|rv: as Barnet suggested, Peng should bid 4@h to show good @s fit, mild slam try|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rv: and his direct 4n should possibly be quant?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|barnets: try and give a ruff|pg||
pc|hT|nt|barnets: looking at dummys diamonds|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|henryb:  @h by E-W should work out well, but you had better correct that|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: hi Amando undo - 61H by N|pg||
nt|pelu: Amanda|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: in OR West bid 3@d|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|barnets: only chance|pg||
nt|rv: as score stands with 1 deal to go, Aus winning match by 21-9|pg||
nt|rv: with only 5 VPs behind leaders Taipei before this round, this win could even more them to first place|pg||
nt|pelu: Yes as Martin say: @DQ is not unly fun - Its the way to pick up @Dj in S|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|pelu: Lead @DK to A and now @HA made the play easy|pg||
nt|henryb:  he may go down now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tejjyid: would have been better with the @D 9 tho|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|sybarra: (student union bridge and euche room)|pg||
mc|9|nt|tejjyid: I think only 8tricks - 2D, 2@H & a @S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the srround play looks good, but it eneded up simplifying the hand for declarer|pg||
pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@S-2@H-?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|janm:  I was wondering about 3@c by East :)|pg||
nt|janm:  But that boat has sailed|pg||
mb|2H|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: automatic 3@C if you're australian :)|pg||
nt|janm:  4@s looks like a sensible bid - don't give the opponents time to find out if they have a good save someplace|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|janm:  So we can speculate about what will happen at the other table when E opens 3@c. Surely 3@s by S, and probably the same final contract as here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: standard carding for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Jan -- then Tony Nunn will have difficult bid as West|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: @D shift will speed up play of this hand|pg||

nt|friggi: 3NT in N/S|pg||
nt|janm: What were you saying about 8 card suits yesterday, Wayne?|pg||
nt|cascade: well there have been plenty of 8s and 9s the first two days|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are occuring too often|pg||
nt|barnets: i think|pg||
nt|barnets: its close|pg||
nt|rv: Aus moving towards magic 25 VP mark, now leading 23-7 with wrong end of VP scale (1 more IMP to reach 24)|pg||
nt|barnets: after the wk two bid|pg||
nt|davidstern: Strange declarer is pitching diamonds which can be ruffed rather than clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: Last board is up and last for me to.|pg||
nt|rodal f: THX spec. Was nice.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: last one all|pg||
mb|3C|nt|janm: And what would you do with this one? Pass and hope to bid later? Open 1, or open a bunch?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: China on the board!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and our last bd of this set |pg||
nt|barnets: they like the multi|pg||
nt|barnets: so do I|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: last board to the match now, thanks very much to Nobuyuki and Kaz for their great comments, thz Amanda on the vugraph, great job, and thx all specs for your feedback|pg||
nt|npcjpn: thanks all.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: join us agin tomorrow|pg||
nt|kaz08833: thanks all too|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3NT N/S here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx to the exelent vug operator. Well done:)|pg||
nt|pelu: last board - 25 VP for Taipie|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: thx to out wonderful operator,   great job as always |pg||
nt|alchilds: easy|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Friggi, and Al,  and Frank and Pat, who were here earlier |pg||
nt|friggi: thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thank you. back in  a bit oveer 30 minutes- lets hope I am more awake then :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: But no easy road to get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and of course great thx to our specs, for the helpful (and sometimes humorous comments |pg||
nt|janm: Lau chose the latter course (when I'm playing that 4 of a minor is natural, I love to be able to open it)|pg||
nt|davidstern: North will make a move and South has a max perhaps they will find it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the real problem was a substandard neg double|pg||
mb|4S|nt|henryb:  another ambitious 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remaining matches for the day are posted now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: next will be Open: Australia v China Macau   Senior: Indonesia v New Zealand (Cornell)|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: In the other room, East also opened 4@c but his partner judged to raise |pg||
nt|kaz08833: this one shd be push|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks K1W1 great job.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 2 matches tomorrow|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thx :)|pg||
nt|pzpp: 2 matches tomorrow? I think that they have 3 left|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thought there were only 2 could be wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: ah, the hand that needs the heart shift|pg||
nt|cascade: an interesting point is that I think that dealing programs need to have published their algorithms to allay suspicion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing 2@C = weak @C + another|pg||
nt|davidstern: There you go|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  on 24HC with no particular source of tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: still a few boards to be played and scored in the open room|pg||
nt|davidstern: So this should be 7 imps to Indonesia assuming 0-1-4-5|pg||
nt|davidstern: For ten tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: A sac at 5@C but 5@H also on|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: overtake and heart seems right|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: i am booked to do 2 :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|friggi: my guess was 3@C 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: quick shot of something then for you....(what ever that is) |pg||
pc|h5|nt|alchilds: my too may go set|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, and maybe the spade 10 should suggest shifting to a heart?|pg||
nt|pelu: again the 1NT 6-12 created the problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid -- 1st DBL = PEN  2nd DBL = Takeout [i think]|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Dont understand, if cant x 3@C bid 3@S:)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this event is really too long, we have to realize how long everybody has already been playing|pg||
pc|d6|nt|janm: Guess not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think any spade but ace is really wrong|pg||
nt|janm: Of course, they're not going to beat 4 whatever they do|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did Caledonia steel candy from the opps?:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|friggi: needs @H play from Dec, diff to find|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is will play @D up from hand |pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N was 13-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S shift is killer|pg||
nt|sybarra: can China make a profit here?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|henryb:  this one needs 3@c tricks, a reasonable shot, and either 4@h and 2@s or lots of spade tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: in normal system u would pass 2@S|pg||
nt|rv: this should make 9 tricks even with likley @s finesse|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|pelu: best lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  My stomach is growling, so I will leave you. Have fun, and thanks, Peter|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: long explanations|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rv: we are playing last board of this match|pg||

pc|s2|nt|cascade: For those kibitzers who are interested in chess|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: absolutely -- i was thinking best defense 300|pg||
nt|rodal f: 22-19 after this board. Then OR left to change the result|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rv: my thanks to excellent Vu graph operator and wonderful co-commentators Barnet Shenkin and Barbara Travis|pg||
nt|babs59: and thank you RV and Barnet, for not jinxing Australia too much|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: no so maybe here a bit more excusable|pg||
nt|barnets: well tks all specs and fellow commentators I am retiring for the night |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|cascade: Ker at the other table is a many time NZ Chess champion|pg||
