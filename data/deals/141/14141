nt|cuttysark: Pips look good enough for 4@S also, though I agree there is no defence to 3NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S2 at S and 6 or 9 at N. Pitch @Ds from N at @H? Should still be on, but...|pg||

nt|fabsayc: this line i dont like|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you may as well cross ruff playing for spade 9 with south|pg||
