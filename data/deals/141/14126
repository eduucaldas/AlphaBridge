nt|vugraphzma: welcome back|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|psridhar: hi all|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, a bold 1@S|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: those Major suit bids will keep EW quiet|pg||
nt|cicus: if he'd passed, E would have bid 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: 2c is tech right bid , not 2h|pg||
nt|psridhar: with a good hand u bid long-short-long ( if u get a chance )|pg||
nt|cicus: I like 2@C, S expected to bid 3@H if parner corrected to 2@H|pg||
nt|psridhar: with a weak hand u bid long-long-short( if forced)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cicus: as Padmanabhand explained to you :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2c plays a few vul undertricks|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2 or 3|pg||
nt|cicus: still, N converted a possible plus to a minus by not passin 1@H|pg||
nt|psridhar: E shd shift to trumps even tho he is overruffing dummy in h|pg||
nt|psridhar: overruffing is like ruffing declarer's losers ( pd's winners)|pg||
nt|cicus: techically, @CJ is the best lead|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c2|nt|psridhar: surrounding play :)|pg||

nt|cicus: or only Q empty|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s8|pc|c9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|cicus: @H8 not best, hard for E to discard|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|psridhar: EW are rapidly reducing their trick tally by opting to ruff rather than draw trumps|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|c8|pc|cJ|pg||

nt|psridhar: played by N it is better- top tricks =12, so 6nt by N is par|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|cicus: now N has a 2NT overcall so they should bid this|pg||
nt|cicus: S might as well just check for aces|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|cicus: of course they must have the toools|pg||
nt|psridhar: south has a problem though-he doesnt know his pd's 2nt includes AK of clubs, and any finesse in cl if required is likely to fail given the multi 2d opg|pg||
nt|cicus: now this is surprising - S does not expect much|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|psridhar: still i think 3nt is too meek with 7 gud clubs|pg||

mc|12|nt|cicus: at least a slam try in clubs would have been in order - a s you do it over your 2NT opening|pg||
nt|psridhar: agree|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|cicus: routine 3NT here|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|cicus: these are the hands why I prefer that 2@S by W shows only 2|pg||
nt|psridhar: now W will be worried his KXX is facing a stiff in dia for 3nt|pg||
nt|cicus: E can bid 3@C and you can avoid 3NT with only a single @D stopper and not enough quick tricks|pg||
nt|psridhar: he can bid 3D now showing doubt and his pd with dia ACE can put him to 3nt|pg||
nt|cicus: now the bidding might go 2@S-3@C-3@D-3NT|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: or maybe 2@S-3@C-3@D-3@S-3NT|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|cicus: (all after E's 2@H rebid of course)|pg||
nt|cicus: I clearly dislike this bidding with W having only a single stop|pg||
nt|psridhar: i wonder how they wd hv bid it if E had AKXXX,KXXX,X,AXX- east wd hv bid the same way and 3nt by west loses the club slam|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|cicus: imagine E with @HK instead of @CA|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: straighforward bidding to the top spot|pg||
nt|psridhar: a bit pushy though|pg||
nt|psridhar: but justified by the bristling spot cards|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cicus: depends on their NT range - but I like N's aggressivity with controls, solid @Hs and @DQ10|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cicus: and the vulnerability is also tempting|pg||

mb|p|nt|cicus: no comparisons yet from open room|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|cicus: now 1@S or 1NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzma: open played 1nt by east and 11 tricks here|pg||
nt|cicus: hard to argue with any of the choices|pg||
nt|vugraphzma: my fault, sry|pg||

mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|psridhar: 3c=super acceptance, now W may gamble a 3nt|pg||
nt|cicus: 3@C accepts the @D invitation, I think|pg||
nt|cicus: W should bid 3NT now|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3nt will go down on a natural h lead|pg||
nt|cicus: it goes down of course on a @H lead|pg||
nt|cicus: still, I'd bid 3NT|pg||
nt|psridhar: on a club lead declarer is unlikely to put up king, so defense will get another chance|pg||
nt|cicus: because of the 6th @D|pg||
