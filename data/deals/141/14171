nt|caitlin: South will definitely keep in this gambling NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: Hello Ellen|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|mcarroll: I would overcall 2@D rather than Double on that S hand|pg||
nt|caitlin: same folks now play 'chicken gambling' which allows you to have an outside Ace or King:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Lukas!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: Yes he kept 3NT, but thought pretty long about his options|pg||
nt|shevek: so Winkiboy 258, Israel 253|pg||
mb|p|nt|dimi: most of the international teams started on wednesday to play the Nation Cup, quite exausting 4 complete days of bridge|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|sybarra: multi 2 @D |pg||

nt|rnmalik: Hi Martin:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: we were finishing a very interesting hand in main club (which I rarely play) |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Rashid|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: seems to be an easy 2@h contract for S|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@c = both Majors I assume|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: i guess, 2@c is for the majors|pg||
nt|dimi: yes|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|caitlin: not sure what his options would be|pg||
nt|dimi: For details of the current standing please check the liveticker: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/bgt_2010/10_05_14_wer.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: west nailed partner, 3@h would've been enough imo|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|caitlin: other than slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 4@s could be a cheery bid, but no more|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|nt|mcarroll: And it nearly resulted in a pretty hopeless @S contract|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rnmalik: yes 2@D was passed and you had 5:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes you saw it |pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 to the 9 spot |pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|dimi: 4@h is 1 down ...5@d 2 down i think |pg||
pc|h4|nt|dimi: yes Nicoleta|pg||
nt|shevek: north also bid too much with such a flat hand|pg||
nt|shevek: 10 losers|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mcarroll: However EW came to the rescue|pg||
nt|caitlin: which is making here|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|vugraphzkk: I agree with you, Martin...|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|shevek: so north changed +50 into -100|pg||
nt|dimi: some kibs pointed out that 4@h has good practical chances if they dont lead clubs|pg||
pc|s5|nt|caitlin: but hard for South to know this|pg||

pc|hA|nt|sybarra: Is there a team called  "die Musketiere" ?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: declarer has to hope trumps are not 4-1|pg||
nt|rnmalik: that solves the 2 @S loser problem.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: yes, its Hartmut Kondoch with Felix Zimmermann, with two French Juniors|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/bgt_2010/10_05_14_wer.html|pg||

nt|xenya: we are confronted with lots of artificial bids on both sides it seems|pg||

nt|chick: I don't think 3@C is a very helpful bid in this situation|pg||
nt|arvidsson: thye have all the ques, just missing AQ of @H|pg||
nt|friggi: they go for a slam|pg||
nt|chick: so all he needs is either spades 3-3, or heart finesse on|pg||

nt|cuttysark: As you say, he did very well to bid at all - I suppose he was trying to shut out the opener|pg||
nt|chick: unless the X shows diamonds, which is possible I guess|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The standard in Sweden must be pretty high given that two of the strongest teams in the country, S:t Erik Berik (last year's winners) and Malmö (with Fredin, Bertheau and Nyström) ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: were knocked out in the semi-finals|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if opener's are 6 up, passouts are impossible|pg||
nt|yuval10: if their system is to open from 6 and higher count, then it's probably safe to say they've never experienced any "all pass" in their partnership|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i admit was indeed disciplined as David wisely pointed out|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe that accounts for it? |pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: yes|pg||
nt|cicus: then they probably play 3NT rsponse as some self-dangerous artificial bid :)|pg||
nt|shevek: pity it's wrongsided|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  S is happy to show both - maximum overcall and @h with his DBL|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: maybe with little defense, we ll see|pg||

nt|xenya: 4@S was a fair alternative of course|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But as it turns out, @D play better, the 4-1 @H split would make a @H contract at the 3 level a major problem|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes but given the 4/4 fit at the table we probably all select 4 @H |pg||
nt|shevek: is north considering a duck here?|pg||
nt|shevek: after all north wouldn't have a clue that west holds 6@hs :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: if so, East gets an overtrick...|pg||
nt|dimi: can't believe ... maybe on his way to bar?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|friggi: truth but that bidding is overrated given that you miss a lot of Aces:)|pg||

nt|h_karluk: The main problem with the Swedish 1C opening is the lack of flexibility: the "strong" hand types have to take a second bid (or else risk not showing their strength), which does not ...|pg||

nt|chick: and now 3@S is cheap to bid|pg||
nt|chick: when you can identify a double-fit against a double-fit, it's important to win the contract ... very risky for a double game swing.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: about one point more than that.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: This may not sound like much of a difference, but it does tend to make the strong types a little more pure.|pg||

nt|jcwla: 3@S), bidding it directly shows the weakest hand - and anything else, even passing, shows at least a modicum of game interest.|pg||

nt|jcwla: players do is make this negative double with just the @C -- pd will never stop putting you on @H's.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Don't know, maybe not - my comment above based on the perhaps faulty premise it was a @S raise.|pg||
nt|yuval10: Erev Tov Roland :)  all is well, great to see you here|pg||
nt|affe82: slam in diamonds might be tough on repeated heart leads|pg||
nt|s bech: spade lead is setting aswell|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: hýzlý 4@h dese þimdi 4@s gelirdi..yavaþ olunca zor|pg||
nt|chick: exactly the same principle I meant about the double-fit hands|pg||
nt|nobbe: 6@H looks most resonable contract|pg||
nt|calabres: Kiss x 10000000 dear Sisi :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: interesting club spots, too|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: 1@h might actually have been natural|pg||
nt|chick: in any case, they arrived at the best spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: North has shown minimum and 6331|pg||
nt|daman: the made 6@H in the OR on Board 2 so a big, fat 17 IMPs to San Sac|pg||
nt|chick: the opps showed their clubs to each other rather than the spades, but in any case, did not lead the !A|pg||
nt|mrdct: this is quite a good layout for declarer despite the 4\2 break|pg||
nt|yuval10: after @d lead declarer will probably play A@h and @h towards hand|pg||
nt|s bech: 2H= 11-13 bal with 4c sup in hearts. |pg||
nt|friggi: what does 3H mean?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: did I say unlucky.... ment very lucky|pg||
nt|chick: 3NN is the contract in OR for bd 2|pg||
nt|s bech: spade lead makes even 5 diamonds shaky|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tomek: Gierul nie skontrowal nawet 3@H|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|chick: @DA*|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very surprising play|pg||
nt|chick: I'm sure it was a spade raise, showing a good hand.  E's pass over 3@D says the rest -- no interest in competing|pg||
nt|jcwla: Even if not, the principle applies to situations where pd has made a conventional raise forcing us to a particular level.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: holding three dead hearts, W probably viewd the negative double as a danger sign when LHO did not bid hearts. also the overcall perhaps is sometimes made on 4 cards. and as u say, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has probably seen the likes of this E hand and perhaps worse:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Right but need partnership agreement -- many pairs play the exact opposite: pass below the level of our force shows some interest.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Back in a flash.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes i never doubted that 2N showed spade support. my question was whether it promised four of them|pg||
nt|yuval10: why didn't S lead a @d ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think N should ask himself that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also, that question was not addressed to the principle you were stating Jordan. I was simply looking for reasons why W did not force to game|pg||
nt|andyv:  white on white save may win a few imps|pg||
nt|po-s: he mght also double and take it 4 down...|pg||
nt|turnip1: 4H make on 3 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|rado: 3NT also an option|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cuttysark: Probably a similar defence to what they play over 1NT - to save memory strain|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@d are ON, of course, so the overcall worked very well|pg||
nt|yuval10: you can say Erev tov to Ida as well...she'll understand u well|pg||
pc|c7|nt|chick: this may put Westerlund back up in the scores|pg||
nt|chick: as xenya said last session ... unusually normal :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: some plays 1@d xfer @h|pg||
nt|chick: well, credit to them finding a contract that has a chance|pg||
nt|affe82:  without interference that downside is negliable though.|pg||
nt|yuval10: E must bid 6@s now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: Shalom Roland|pg||
nt|yuval10: he already bid 4@s to show minimum|pg||
nt|chick: he may not, has to discount his @HQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Shabat Shalom Ida :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: he already discounted it with 4@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: after W made another try with 5@c he must respect it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's the case when Q is better than K|pg||
nt|yuval10: AX @d is an asset|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|aldek: na Acolu z karami otwieramy w holandii 2@D, zeby grac od silnej reki|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and good swith at trick 2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure why S doubled--was on top of 2S bid and has no heart card|pg||
nt|yuval10: for those who joins us now - the score is incorrect and is upside-down|pg||
nt|s bech: Hans-Ove picks up another 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|affe82: this will be hopeless. as (several) kibber(s) say any defence is setting|pg||
nt|po-s: sorry only 3|pg||
nt|ritong: ah ok|pg||
nt|rado: 2/4 leads for NS|pg||
nt|ignatov_bg: deklaranta moje da izvadi, no trqbva da izcaka 1 pika na mora i posle da  napravi impas trefa ot hod|pg||
pc|dK|nt|aldek: troche przelicytowal|pg||
nt|boomelant: kara zniknely niestety|pg||
nt|tomek: po 2@S 3@H|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed 5@D is a fortunate make but with a combined 20 count and no special features...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 10 cards in the minors in West are good distributionals value|pg||
nt|mr murray: if opener was an American "naturale" diamond n/s dont buy the hand so easily|pg||
nt|cuttysark: True - the overcall made it impossible for Wset to bid diamonds on his own|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes Murray, 1@D open would work here|pg||
nt|s bech: so we´ll see a swing on scoreborad soon in favour of Skalman|pg||
nt|chick: a boring partscore here ... time to put your laundry in the fridge or get a beer from the dryer ... or is it the other way around?|pg||
nt|affe82: this board can lead to a shift of leaders|pg||
pc|d6|nt|atalok: ama mecbur býraktýlar 4 h demeye|pg||
nt|tez: @c empas gecse oluyordu|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: powinien wyrzuciæ karo, by zachowaæ szanse teoretyczne|pg||

nt|chick: this will go down, I'm not sure either side had a making contract |pg||
nt|chick: if the other table doesn't reach slam|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: exciting bidding -- i don't think i agree with W's 2 passes|pg||
nt|chick: agree, but perhaps he was afraid of pushing them to game ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Friendly placement of cards.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we convinced him )))|pg||
nt|yuval10: well bided|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|chick: still, no excuse not to pull his partners double with a 6-5 black hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The natural option of the 1C opening bid contains hands of 15-17 HCP which are almost certainly not pure two-bid hands, and so these can be a problem.|pg||
nt|daman: compressed 4 @D tricks into 3 :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: real score is 33:22 to Gullvi|pg||
nt|ziff:  "Real" score is 33-22, Gullvi|pg||
nt|ziff:  :)|pg||
nt|friggi: he wants to beat the contract - I guess:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: you can use the running score here: http://www.swangames.com/magic/magic/www.php?csm=Match&nsid=242|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2uj293f  running scores|pg||

nt|s bech: bad beat for N/S. |pg||
pc|s4|nt|yuval10: the contract is making now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mrdct: yes didn't see much to gain from @c continuation|pg||
nt|chick: someone asks why E didn't double .....|pg||
pc|s8|nt|yakop: 2cle 4nt diyecek el var nerdeyse|pg||

nt|mlodygda83: tak, wyranie mia³ chwilê s³aboci|pg||
nt|xenya: nor with E's double, for that matter -- looks borderline at best  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, E may even have been a bit reluctant to sign off in 4S, given that he had a very good hand facing a heart splinter|pg||
nt|arvidsson: with the heart lead|pg||
nt|friggi: that is a nice way to say it:)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||

nt|turnip1: no unlikely defence|pg||
pc|d7|nt|atalok: 4 h normal  bence|pg||
nt|chick: stopping in a partscore after a strong club opening and an A and K with E surprises me|pg||
nt|h_karluk: These hands are also present in the 1C opening in standard systems, but there you have the option of rebidding in a new suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tempting to jump to 6S over 5C by W, but if W has a heart void there could be a grand slam|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|chick: but they must have some way of putting on the brakes|pg||
nt|daman: he will have to finesse the Jxxx of @Hs to make this|pg||
nt|daman: his @C spots stink|pg||

nt|shevek: now for a 12-card fit...|pg||
nt|sybarra: over drove it |pg||
mb|p|nt|dimi: i think 11 tricks in @s is the limit for NS|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|dimi: 9 tricks for EW in @d|pg||
mb|d|nt|h_karluk: with running diamonds and H AK, pity not much woth West|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *with|pg||
nt|cicus: a lot of duplicated values here for NS, can they avoid slam?|pg||
nt|caitlin: board 2 where N-S stopped in 3@D, open room 3N down 6 for 11 IMPs. only score on table thus far|pg||
nt|sybarra: and an easy 4 @H here |pg||
nt|shevek: it has been an accident in bd 11 (worth 11 imps)|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe many long days of playing contributing |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jtr: 1NT for me|pg||
nt|h_karluk: balanced seat|pg||
nt|h_karluk: good guess boss|pg||
nt|xenya: on 4, the Israeli NS went for a 5@D save against 4@H -- phantom in theory, but fine in practice -- 9 imps to Israel|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: sorta biz X, shld work now|pg||
nt|jtr: Pushy double will work here|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 20 the other room used a smolen type sequence to get to game |pg||
nt|xenya: good 3@S by S -- lead directing -- just in case|pg||
nt|xenya: he is prepared to sacrifice in clubs|pg||
mb|3H|nt|cicus: ah, @D finesse taken there as well?|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: 2@C is catch all for game force|pg||
mb|4H|nt|xenya: but maybe W would have done better if he'd just bid 3N? |pg||
nt|xenya: tough for W now i think -- may easily go wrong|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|caitlin: and then West ran his clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: ditto |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Again the 4-4 minor fit is found|pg||
nt|shevek: probably a claim at T2...|pg||
nt|dimi: yes |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tomi2:  somebody knows the meaning of 3@C? maybe a transfer to @D?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could test declarer |pg||
nt|rnmalik: that should have been bid. It is always better to bid vul game. |pg||
nt|friggi: sure it will|pg||
nt|friggi: but he has to play for AK in west|pg||
nt|cicus: the first sign of misfitting values, the @C cue-bid|pg||
pc|cK|nt|shevek: we expect a claim at T2|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe trick 4 |pg||
nt|shevek: fair enough|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tomi2:  thx|pg||
nt|h_karluk: brb guys, don't miss me too much :P|pg||
nt|jtr: Have fun|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rnmalik: nothing is working for him-bad distribution.|pg||
nt|friggi: if not he is doomed from the start|pg||
nt|sybarra: nothing breaks well for him on this hand|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|caitlin: 5@H leads to slam|pg||
nt|cicus: 5%H asked S to bid slam if... if what?|pg||
nt|caitlin: and the 2@D bid by South|pg||
nt|cicus: 5@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: 5@h just invitational|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cicus: a @D cue may have been more helpful for South to diagnose the wasted values|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|friggi: regardless he has to make a go at it:)|pg||
nt|xenya: W did well to double but for some reason E pulled|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes and with very minimal hand, no extra features than South has shown, surprising 6@H|pg||
nt|dimi: no claim?|pg||
nt|sybarra: NOT ruffing low on this one |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|sfoxa:  but why they stopped?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: specs are guessing -3|pg||
nt|friggi: Not far from it...|pg||
nt|sybarra: would it have helped to duck the first ht? |pg||
nt|friggi: I think so|pg||
nt|rnmalik: he is required to duck every suit and bad breaks:)|pg||
nt|friggi: never retify the count for the def i spossible - my law:)|pg||
nt|friggi: good comment|pg||
nt|friggi: if possible I would have said,...sry|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are either thinking, ripping up the cards, or losing connection |pg||
nt|friggi: Shirley, we are here to think out of the box:)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

nt|shevek: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/bgt_2010/10_05_14_wer.html|pg||
pc|hK|nt|caitlin: do they play 2@C as game force?|pg||

nt|pbundy: this lead could mean an overtrick - but rather meaningless|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The concept is reported to have originated with Mr. Eric Jannersten. The idea behind the concept is to give the opener the most opportunity to make the most accurate and ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: descriptive rebid, in order to describe his holding. As a result, most of the responses are artificial in meaning.|pg||
nt|yuval10: trump lead might give declarer some difficulties, but he can still make because of 3-3 @c|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this is the problem using 1@C weak balanced - there are few information when there are overcall (and there are when you have only 11/13)|pg||
nt|mr murray: seems like passive decision by rag|pg||
nt|mr murray: partner opened the bidding and raised. |pg||
nt|mr murray: he has a 6 loser hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: E/W make a easy 5@h - it is important (in IMP competition overall) to call game, because if opps make 4@S you wil lose too much - better a little risk (5@H-1 vs 4@s-1) that a game ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: vuln for opps|pg||
nt|mr murray: e-w should not like this result|pg||

nt|chick: not to bid this slam*|pg||
nt|mrdct: might be a chance for hans to get on the score board|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  yes i do think he is likely to duck as it would blow 2 tricks to go up with the king if S has a singleton as the linbe i have described suggests|pg||

nt|s bech: when you know decl has a good suit with 6-8 (most likely 7) I would not choose a passive lead. |pg||

nt|chick: trusting pard to have 4 spades, I think N can afford a 3@S bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for sure|pg||
nt|chick: the double should also show at least 3 diamonds (in theory)|pg||

nt|affe82: but no source tricks? just 7 winners now or?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzjk: The results are a bit missleading since board 24 has been scored in some mystic way, giving Skalman 11 imp they havn't deserved (yet?)|pg||

nt|vugraphzkk: thanks too|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  for Bonn Nationa Cup, there were on-line scores. and what about this tournamnet?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: there are also online scores|pg||
nt|yuval10: it's a matter of imp anyway - -17 instead of -16|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: 4@h is a good sacrifice against 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 2@d multy here|pg||
nt|xenya: somewhat unexpectedly, the match is almost even -- it did look as though Winkiboy had an upper hand |pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|cicus: so a useful win for Turkey|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|jtr: A wild one too|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/bgt_2010/10_05_14_wer.html - these ones, t.y.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: yes|pg||
nt|shevek: allowed 2@s, 2@h,  @d and 2@c only|pg||
nt|dimi: last board for this set|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that is easy to find |pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: they missed chances in board 4 and 5|pg||
nt|cicus: this board is not going to alter the result|pg||
nt|cicus: N has a 3@H bid in my opinion|pg||
nt|cicus: and S will carry on to game|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: well, i think board 14 will bring some IMPs for Israel|pg||
nt|cicus: N has to filler cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and this is easy |pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: 2@h is more often 5 than 6 cards...|pg||
nt|yuval10: both should've been a pickup for Winklboy team and turned into minus|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  seems they also use transfers after 1@C-x|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|cicus: two*|pg||
nt|shevek: not as easy as the previous board, true|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|caitlin: obviously 2N here is hearts and minor|pg||
nt|cicus: S is overbidding now|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|cicus: as 3@H was not forcing, he should have settled for game|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: 2NT = @h+@c|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzkk: but sometimes it doesnt work :(|pg||
nt|caitlin: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: in this board the computer says that 3NT are makeable|pg||
nt|shevek: similar in a way|pg||
nt|sybarra: last bd of this set,  thx again Lukas. Great job!|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmmm|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: they even didnt find 3NT, so no decision problem for S|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tomi2:  that 4333 8 count with no king and ace and no heart stopper wouldnt be my favorite hand for 1nt facing a partner who could be "light on classic shape"|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also to Nicoleta,  great to be with you again |pg||
nt|shevek: thx shirley|pg||
nt|shevek: great job Lukas|pg||

pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: absolutelty a wild one, fortunately exotic flowers do not bloom very often|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|mcarroll: Open Room is slowere than here, but all the scores so far have beento the Hungarian team|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: last board for this round|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and 3NT should make|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: seems, that Hungary will win this fight...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Declarer has 2@H, 3@S 3 minor tricks and N will be endplayed to give the 9th|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Drew,  great point on the previous hand |pg||
pc|h4|pg||

nt|h_karluk: *stay safe|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yuval10: one may wonder why did E took off the X|pg||
nt|shevek: If west opens that kind of 11, partner should be aware ...|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|sybarra: this is last bd of this set |pg||
nt|yuval10: did well to prevent an overtrick|pg||
nt|sybarra: my schedule shows very shortly |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|rnmalik: would you prefer 2NT by E for shape or feature etc as per their agreement. Would make 6.|pg||
nt|shevek: I think we had a late start this match though shirley|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to Lukas our terrific operator |pg||
nt|xenya: now this is a really good lesson never get disheartened by a bad result: your counterparts in the other room may do equally badly|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: yes  we did |pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|cicus: yes, Lukas, bd 14 may bring in a handful of IMPs for Israel, if they can cope with the hand|pg||
nt|cicus: let's have  alook at the other room, bye everyone|pg||

nt|chick: possible game either way here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 2! = 2@H. Ouch|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes, come to think about it i think that 2@h should be natural and 2@d = 2 suiters|pg||
nt|nobbe: good board for Dialect, easy to get to high 140 should be a good score|pg||
nt|jcwla: I must head out - thanks all.|pg||
nt|yuval10: thx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as for double vs 1H....a lot of the time they break even. 1H better when what yu want is to be in your 53 heart fit. clearly better if opops get to 3N, which is far from remote|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thanks jordan:)|pg||
nt|friggi: lead issue, could take 2 first tricks in @H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hmm, never seen a one suit intrafinesse endgame before|pg||
nt|arvidsson: more spades for East|pg||
nt|friggi: this will be costly|pg||
nt|s bech: 6sp from W ?|pg||
nt|s bech: E|pg||
nt|yuval10: Yellow team actually are leading now|pg||
nt|friggi: no the last one|pg||
nt|s bech: when dummy goes down I´d not feel that good in 3NT|pg||
nt|friggi: corrcto|pg||
nt|chick: looks like an easy 3N for NS|pg||
nt|friggi: yes cannot be misted|pg||
nt|s bech: no swing|pg||

mb|p|nt|atalok: ben sayýn ortagýmýn 2 cl ine katýlýyorummm|pg||

nt|yuval10: 3@h - 4@h here?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes|pg||
nt|friggi: that can be a matter of life and death:)|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|cuttysark: Worth discussing these things with partner :)|pg||
nt|chick: and would have made it if he played the simple odds in hearts and dropped the Q|pg||
nt|arvidsson: from East is magic|pg||

nt|mrdct: i guess ew will find their @S fit and stretch to a non-making game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: awkward bid for E\|pg||
nt|yuval10: easy when you have 2@s as NF|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unles playing NF free bids|pg||
nt|s bech: 6sp From E of course. Friendly layot in slam.|pg||
nt|s bech: Hans-Ove has recoverd from the loss at b2 with a swing on b4. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: North realizes just now that he was one K short for his 20-21 bal|pg||
nt|turnip1: 4S not hearts|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|boomelant: przegral Marek te 3nt|pg||
nt|pbundy: will n/s even enter the auction, tho?|pg||
nt|chick: probably not|pg||

nt|mlodygda83: mo¿e Gierul stwierdzi³, ¿e kawa vergnano to lura?|pg||
nt|yuval10: well, earlier this week we saw the French women's team playing in a splinter twice in as many sessions|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But 2@D is clearer under the bid: the 1@H response is often xxxx and you may want to bid hearts naturally|pg||
nt|rnmalik: appears so.|pg||
nt|yuval10: S in the OR found the only lead that make 13 tricks for declarer possible|pg||
nt|yuval10: negative free bids works here|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@s from N now?|pg||
nt|chick: so back to a very close match|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: now 4@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard to say. W is not close to max and E has mediocre hand|pg||
nt|chick: 1@D has several possible meanings, 10-16.  one of those meanings is 4+ @D and 4+ other|pg||
nt|caitlin: that is one advantage of S bidding 1NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like N has a natural @c lead now|pg||
nt|arvidsson: hard to know in the bidding who of opponents have the K of clubs, so one would know who should be declarer|pg||
nt|chick: 3@S apparently preemptive, but N goes anyway|pg||
nt|s bech: if decl playes clubs for 3-1 he will go down|pg||
nt|ignatov_bg: another negative free bid|pg||
nt|ritong: sort of|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: ty Henri and Liubo for support, see you after about 10 min.|pg||

nt|zbig1959: tia, podawano j¹ i dlatego Bogus (pi¹cy) wybra³ pesymistyczne 2@H|pg||
nt|chick: N had the chance right there to X over 2@H|pg||
nt|chick: for S is harder without either minor|pg||
nt|yuval10: the 1@d opening will probably take NS to 2NT|pg||
nt|ziff:  N would have liked to double for take-out :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am astonished that declarer went down in 4H|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite reasonable to play S for 2-2 @h IMO|pg||
nt|yuval10: S for singel @h rather|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure why the rush to play @s.... Martin's line would have given a 2nd chance with no risk|pg||
nt|haans: do not like that 2@S|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S no problem for n/s    e/w can save for 500 in 5@C|pg||
nt|turnip1: 5C is 2 down|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would have bid 4 @S directly - not opening for 5 @c sacrifice|pg||
nt|ady: looks like e/w now out of bidding|pg||
nt|po-s: 4H???|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: so San-Sac shouldn't feel ashame - it happenes sometimes|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt easy make|pg||
nt|yuval10: or even more if S feels optimistic|pg||
nt|mrdct: well judged by east|pg||
nt|chick: it may be that 2@S shows a minimum hand, too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: K of D??|pg||
nt|yuval10: now likely to matter that much here, seem like 11 tricks in 3NT |pg||
nt|marlowepi: sort of works|pg||
nt|rado: disciplined pass by N facingvery weak 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: a bit wet by both sides?|pg||
nt|chick: so I predict 2@H+2 and time to make some tea :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that might be an overbod...couldnt W have 6HCP?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N had passed in 3rd seat at favorable and had already shown up with a ton of HCP. it had to be S with the @HQ|pg||
nt|chick: yes, this is the usual restricted choice situation when I am playing :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3NT or 4@H?|pg||
nt|turnip1: No exitement on this board, but exiting leaderboard 151-151-149|pg||
nt|turnip1: or the elegant save of 4N, 2 down... :-)|pg||

nt|h_karluk: and Sven-Olof Flodquist.|pg||
nt|chick: 1N 17-19 I suspect, so W declines the invitation|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@d means 4+@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: right on Liz|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed it does - best to laugh about it and move on|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@d was @d and major i persume|pg||
nt|haans: 4 Ts is a lot|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is not about shape, but about HCP, N was marked with 1o HCP already|pg||

nt|turnip1: putting P under pressure?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: switch ten and 7 of spades and i think there would be a guard squeeze for 6N without a spade lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: yep and persumably N would've opened with 12 points and 4 @s's|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes that was my point. probably any 12 points but for sure with 4S which were known about|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 7@D is 4 off|pg||
nt|friggi: yes|pg||
