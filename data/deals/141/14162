mb|p|nt|rednaxela: Hi, Simon.|pg||
nt|copeyj: On the board before, as I said in private, if 1N was 14-16 I think it deserved to miss a game - you just should not downgrade vulnerable at all imo unless you have an ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: extraordainary reason to which it doesnt look to me like you do on that hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a dangerous double by michael Macdonagh|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: That's on the basis that it's easier to persuade East that you have a 5th Club after|pg||
nt|oliverc: opening 1@H than having a 5th heart once you open 2@C|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sundiszno: ok, but you must persuade hime you have a 6th also|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: Paterson explained it is 14-16 or a poor 17 count before play|pg||
