pc|d5|nt|rednaxela: This is a key match with England in the lead in the event and the Sponsor's team not far behind.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Your host in this room is Alex Adamson, who will be pleased to welcome fello commentators as they gather :)|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Last year the Sponsor's team scored most VPs but were not eligible to win the trophy, which went to Scotland.|pg||

nt|rednaxela: Evening, Anne.|pg||
nt|rednaxela: So far England have won all their matches, but England 2 (or the Sponsor's team) are close behind them.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|rednaxela: John Holland has been undertaking fact finsing missions to Scotland.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|nt|rednaxela: He recently lost a marathon Scottish Cup final that went to several sets of extra boards.|pg||
nt|idc: Eng 1 on 80 VPs,  Eng 2 on 73 if I can still add|pg||
mb|r|nt|idc: England 2 are the sponsors team, and a pretty good one too|pg||
mb|p|nt|rednaxela: The Patron's team actually won last year's event but are not elligible to hold the trophy.|pg||

nt|oliverc: hi everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzmh: Hi wellcome|pg||
nt|galadriel: The 2NT opening means they will play in @H rather than S but 4 of either major is fine|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good Morning, all and welcome to the Seniors Camrose.|pg||
mb|d|nt|oliverc: hi Ivan|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk10: Last 8 boards of the tournament|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cuttysark: We are a little short of commentators - all welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Bernard Teltscher faces an unenviable choice of a major - so he has sensibly let partner speak|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good afternoon, and wlecome back to the Seniors Camrose in Glasgow|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmh: Current standings before last round GIB 183 Quantum 183 Shato rosenovo 178 Bacho 170|pg||
nt|Walddk10: wow tied 1st|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: so a nebulous 1@D from North, but the rest of the bidding fairly predictable|pg||
nt|sundiszno: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk10: Borth pairs play Precision|pg||
nt|Walddk10: Hi Adam|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Ys, most tournament pairs have a way of finding out about a 5 card Major in the 2NT opener, but when they have one of their own they tend to show that.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sorry, Ian, I interrupted you in full flow :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|idc: I can hear the specs shout with one voice: THANKS LIZ!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|galadriel: 2NT shows 19-20|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Had East been 5-2 in the Majors a 5-3 Spade fit could have been missed.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sundiszno: so this can be the final |pg||
nt|oliverc: this should make fairly comfortably|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|nt|galadriel: Although even if you play 20-22, this is probably worth an upgrade|pg||
nt|idc: The defence to 1@hX could have been a carnage but it's a bit double dummy to manage that|pg||

nt|idc: maybe it was the way I played them|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|yo_yo: i was a bit surprised John Holland didnt double the last contract|pg||

nt|yo_yo: He is usually sharp on  the doubles|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sundiszno: this depends basically on finding @sQ and @cJ|pg||

pc|s4|nt|galadriel: With such a weak hand, Short chooses to lead partner's suit|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sundiszno: but if the defense doesn't attack @hs early, you have plenty of time for even going wrong |pg||
pc|s6|pg||

nt|oliverc: Normally precision pairs would prefer 1@H over 2@C with the West hand|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|rednaxela: A wheel seems to have come off for the Scots in the Open Room on board 2.  With a vulnerable game on they defended a non-vul 2C-6.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rednaxela: Hi, Simon.|pg||
nt|copeyj: On the board before, as I said in private, if 1N was 14-16 I think it deserved to miss a game - you just should not downgrade vulnerable at all imo unless you have an ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: extraordainary reason to which it doesnt look to me like you do on that hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a dangerous double by michael Macdonagh|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|oliverc: That's on the basis that it's easier to persuade East that you have a 5th Club after|pg||
nt|oliverc: opening 1@H than having a 5th heart once you open 2@C|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sundiszno: ok, but you must persuade hime you have a 6th also|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: Paterson explained it is 14-16 or a poor 17 count before play|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Agreed. To me that was a normal 17 count.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Usually it shows the other 2 suits|pg||
nt|lark20: esp vul|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I fell a victim to that recently, my partner didnt have the  2 suits he promised|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in fact it cost us the event|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
nt|rednaxela: I'm guessing neither could make a penalty double, but someone had to do something!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|oliverc: I would merely point out that 4@H probably making here whereas 5@C is not :)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
nt|sundiszno: and in this hand, even if east had a 3rd @h, 5@c is safer, youdon't get shortened|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|s4|pg||
nt|evtimov: opening 2@C is more aggressive than 1@H|pg||

nt|copeyj: If you don't play pass as forcing on 2 in the open room then S had to act|pg||

nt|golfsquash: Disaster for Ireland on bd 9, played wrong game.|pg||

nt|idc: But same lead & same result in OR, so last board flat|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|rednaxela: Again, a possible game with 3 top losers and some handling to be done.|pg||
nt|copeyj: Some chance here if playing strong and 5, 1@C-1@S-2@S-4@C(splinter) but that would be an overbid in my view|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|idc: England 1 were 7 VPs ahead of England 2 going into this match, so any win at all for them will stretch them away|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rednaxela: To my mind that is not worth 4@d but the two learned players in the East seats disagree with me.|pg||

nt|lark20: I thought that would have been obvious|pg||
nt|idc: Ross Harper may not have heard me:  UNUSUAL NT ROSS|pg||
nt|lark20: Now what does Paul do?|pg||
nt|idc: I used to play 1@s p 2@s 2NT as hearts & a minor 2 suited on grounds of frequency and importance|pg||
nt|idc: but this auction isn't quite the same as that one|pg||
nt|lark20: 3C looked such a nice contract|pg||
nt|idc: Is Paul just checking whether 3@h can be a game try here?|pg||
nt|idc: I'm with you Beryl|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|rednaxela: The defence will be short and sharp here.|pg||
nt|golfsquash: This is a good game, down on the bad trump break.|pg||
nt|idc: You could argue that any hand with 6 cards hearts would either have bid earlier or wouldn't bid 3@h now|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|idc: I like that arguement but perhaps safer for Paul is including the possibilty that partner isn't on the same wavelength|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||
