nt|vugraphzks: director being called|pg||

nt|patricck: If anyone was going to stay out of game it would be east by passing 1NT, but he has quite a nice hand for spades if partner had shown 4, so I don't really blame him for his ...|pg||

nt|patricck: The fact that 5@H went off will save the Director some work, North/South are no longer feeling disadvantaged|pg||

nt|psridhar: exciting hand with lots of shape we will see ACTION now :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: if you're up to it -- spy on other tables using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: I'm not sure how much West had shown, but at teams it was important to duck the 2nd club in case it could be beaten. Maybe it would have been a more interesing decision at ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=relay    delaying the decision|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rnmalik: 6@H by EW as I see and save in @S very costly at this vul position.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3@D=FG, 6-9 HCP, 4@H & 4+@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|patricck: N/S had a sacrifice in @C, but unless North was inclined to open an undiscipled 3@C with a side 4 card major there was no way to get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|alanz: 3@H appears to be the limit for NS|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D|nt|patricck: And passing 3@S on the North cards would have been a fairly scary option|pg||
