nt|yuval10: unfortunately for S, N has a @h shortness against his @h void|pg||

nt|rmb1: The defence might win @HAQ, @DA and @CAKx|pg||

nt|vugraphzjk: Rehi everyone, this is the match between team Hans-Ove and Skalman in the Swedish Team Championships 2010|pg||
nt|affe82: this should not give decl to much of a hassle with a fortunate @d king|pg||
nt|haans: Kamras are on a loosing steak 2p from 2nd placed Hans-Ove and only 3p from 3rd Gullvi Only 36 boards left|pg||

nt|snetram: natomiast wysokoæ 4 nie jest polecana dla linii WE|pg||
nt|chick: Westerlund has a long way to get back in the running, but it's possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|zbig1959: miejmy nadziejê ¿e bêd¹ podobne rozdania jak w poprzednim segmencie, gdzie dzia³o siê wiele:)|pg||

nt|pbundy: i am guessing a heart shift. different defense against 4 and 5 perhaps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi Martin:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I am afraid that the spread of a 5 card major as being suitable for a weak2/multi has reached epidemic proportions|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi Marshall, Martin.|pg||
nt|chick: the diamonds are nice, and if the @DK were onside, this would actually make|pg||
nt|chick: EW have an easy 12 tricks (6 hearts, 4 spades, 2 clubs), unfortunately NS can get 2 diamonds first |pg||
nt|s bech: likley to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: NS play strong club, counting zz points. EW plays swedish standard (4c openings)|pg||
nt|turnip1: Yes, will be tough to make|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Ida Grönkvist is our very competent operator|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Hi Rashed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in 2HX EW would be taking tricks until the sun goes down on the Nordkapp|pg||
nt|rnmalik: You are very right.|pg||

pc|h9|nt|tez: soran cuebid oynuyorlarmýþ|pg||
nt|bridge_one: correct to discrd the @D, keeping the control in the hand about @C and keeping 4@s in the dummy|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Sveta and Matthias|pg||
nt|ziff:  Hi all|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rnmalik: @S play needed to make 4@S|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Sveta|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this agreement gains popularity - if after partner's opening 1nt responder doesn't see more prospects than a game, he bids 4@c (or 4@d) with both majors|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  4@c shows better @h, while 4@d emphasizes @s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Here with 5/5 S had a good bid.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and minimum info for the opps|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @d lead looks normal and thereafter it's hard to bring contract home|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H understandably worried S with such a weak suit, but it is a bidder's game|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi Sveta|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mlodygda83: optycznie w kara idzie nawet szlemik, ale nie mo¿na uzbieraæ 12 lew, np. jeli otworz¹ kiery|pg||

nt|xenya: should be a healthy pickup for Westerlund|pg||
nt|chick: bad luck in the lie of cards he will have to finesse, so even 5@C will be difficult, 6 hopeless|pg||
nt|peachy: he may of course not know it:)|pg||
nt|nobbe: should end up with 7 tricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: as specs suggest that the only contract making is actually 6@d - goodluck in trying to arrive there|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hej Ida|pg||
nt|yuval10: and Erev Tov Ida|pg||
nt|chick: And to Ida :)|pg||

nt|mlodygda83: niestety nie wiem w jakich dok³adnie sekwencjach j¹ stosuj¹|pg||
nt|chick: necessary to set up the heart trick before giving E a chance to pitch a heart on @DQ|pg||
nt|chick: S shows good judgment to stop short with no spade cuebid from partner|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2uj293f  running scores|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They do have 9 tricks but in the race for tricks NS are likely to get 5 first|pg||
nt|turnip1: looks like 3S, 1C, 1D for the defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: 1@h promises 8+ hcp and 5+@s/balanced hand|pg||

nt|daman: he will have to play a @D towards the King|pg||
nt|daman: or make the opps play @Ds for him|pg||
nt|peachy: this also works, on the power of spots and if they play diam, all good|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S was lucky to see partner doesn't pass, but is hard to find altenative to 1@h opening|pg||
nt|yuval10: once again that's the reason why N didn't support @h right away|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  or someone votes for other one?|pg||
nt|turnip1: Playing the king is hard to find, but gives the declarer a better position|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  NS appear to be playing a polish club with variable NT 14-16 or 15-17|pg||
nt|turnip1: just made then|pg||

nt|vugraphzjk: NS play swedish standard with 4c openings. EW do also play very natural, though the opening 1@c contains all 16+ hands|pg||

nt|friggi: Eric was right:)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: likley to be a club lead?|pg||
nt|s bech: i dont think so|pg||
nt|friggi: yes I support that|pg||
nt|arvidsson: the alternative is diamon |pg||
nt|friggi: not as attractive|pg||
nt|s bech: of forgot East was on lead|pg||
nt|arvidsson: but i doubt you lead from a king knowing partner having one Ace|pg||
nt|friggi: right|pg||
nt|s bech: 5 clubs and 5 spades both to optimistic. no dbl though|pg||
nt|andyv:  now low @d|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tomek: systemtrafi|pg||
nt|s bech: club seems normal from east.|pg||
nt|friggi: !X is the lead|pg||
nt|friggi: @C|pg||
nt|arvidsson: is there any obvious kine of play ?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: line|pg||
nt|friggi: all other leads can be harmfull:)|pg||
nt|friggi: play W for @D|pg||
nt|friggi: hoping for KQx|pg||
nt|arvidsson: if clubs break you have 11? just loosing 2 @H|pg||
nt|friggi: dec has to take @C A nad fin @S |pg||
nt|arvidsson: doubt he will play for KQ of @D onside|pg||
nt|friggi: agree, but that is the hand you have to draw, if you want to have a chance my friend:)|pg||
nt|s bech: I Dont think spade finesse is best line. just ruff one spade in dummy and try to only have 2 heart loosers|pg||
nt|s bech: or should you play clubs for 5-1 becouse of the lead?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: the best chance must be to play for @H 3-2 (being able for 2 loosers) and clubS 4-2?|pg||
nt|s bech: I think so|pg||
nt|friggi: dec has to play for sin @H|pg||
nt|arvidsson: but the lead is fishy.... maybe one can sniff the 5-1 |pg||
nt|s bech: but now decl might reconsider after the cl 3 lead|pg||
nt|friggi: otherwise he can just tr hands up in the air|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mlodygda83: kolejne karo i kolejny pik wyrzucony, co uchroni Tusia przed parad¹ w koñcówce|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: ale to tylko walka o dziewi¹t¹ lewê|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@S makes even on a @D lead, but declarer should take care to discard a diamond on hearts before playing trumps|pg||
nt|s bech: will east get endplayed for 10|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yakop: ben ben oynuyosam 1 nt acardým baþkasý oynuyosa acmazdým:)|pg||
nt|zbig1959: bez z³apania Q@H siê nie obejdzie, chyba ze zasda ograniczoengo wyboru, spadaj¹ca Q@D od S|pg||
nt|pbundy: exactly|pg||
nt|arvidsson: will be an interesting show to view|pg||
nt|chick: and with a quiet sigh of relief ... :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|tez: @h on ataðý  karþýlamak için iyi:)|pg||
nt|tomek: jak tak trafia, to czemu nie 3ba?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: North doesn't seem too excited about the contract|pg||
nt|daman: if that were so     you would never get to play in 1NT|pg||
nt|s bech: here we go|pg||
nt|arvidsson: for that i am certain|pg||
pc|cT|nt|nobbe: The club lead and continuation makes the task easy for declarer|pg||
nt|friggi: Simon, I consder this a force line:)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|affe82:  spade would have set it.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jcwla: S led the 9 hoping to draw the ten - and, in a way, did.|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|pbundy: very perceptive; i wouldn't be, either|pg||
nt|chick: a knowledgable kib suggests that this might be xy-nt probably 2 c inviting........any hand............. and 2d gameforcing|pg||
nt|daman: a bit unsettling for commentators when the systems are highly unusual|pg||
nt|peachy: the alert shows 1NR as trf, if I understand it correctly, both sides trf?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one might say: "yes but N has AKQ of trumps, and S who was missing them made a try".  true enough, but it was already those 3 top trumps that were the only possible justification ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for the 2S raise, so N has already bid that part of his hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure why E didn't knock out the @c entry|pg||
nt|turnip1: maybe forcing|pg||
nt|milton_se: I would prefer 1NT after the weak 1D |pg||
nt|po-s: 0-7??|pg||
nt|ritong: claim 9 before the ceiling falls again|pg||
nt|rado: welcome all|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ryskiel_: 9 jest z góry a bêdzie 12|pg||
nt|chick: pretty solid defense|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|chick: I'm sure he is feeling very bad about it|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|friggi: Q|pg||
nt|s bech: If clubs were breakning this yould be claim now|pg||
nt|arvidsson: should be an open book now, knowing E have 5 clubs 1 heart |pg||
nt|friggi: Emma is good at this so I am sure that she will play the Q:)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|chick: yes, it would sure be nice if a condition of being on vugraph were to have the CCs online for us :)|pg||
nt|peachy: there are, they are in Swedish|pg||
nt|chick: lol yes I saw them, if only I could read Swedish .... :-/|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/Warne2.pdf <-- their CC. In swedish though|pg||
nt|mr murray: my personal choice would be to bid a game. Noone put a gun to souths head to bid 1 spade.  I wouldnt have but 1 spade should have hit gold|pg||
pc|s9|nt|daman: I just saw    The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo    I understand Swedish very well now   :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Time for me to call it a day. Have fun everyone. Good night, see you tomorrow. God natt/Laila Tov|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|pbundy: could easily be duplicated|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tez: atak kuvvetli oyuncuya gelmeli prensibiyle ha:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: small @h was a nice play|pg||
nt|chick: yes, but won't save him from defeat :)|pg||
nt|s bech: well done|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|arvidsson: playing the A|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|tez: ikili turnuva olsa top  skor almýþtý|pg||
nt|pbundy: tough that the 5 level wasn't safe; lots of duplicated values|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|ritong: ok, ok|pg||
pc|dT|nt|haans: instructing hand Good body in all suits|pg||
nt|andyv:  finis|pg||

nt|sybarra: some days are like that!  (at least for me) |pg||
nt|friggi: that happens ..many times:)|pg||
nt|xenya: ah yes|pg||
nt|Walddk7: This is a fine slam|pg||
nt|cicus: sometimes you cannot tell just how much they are worth|pg||
nt|caitlin: I would think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: just 3@h was GF|pg||
nt|dimi: are you sure Lukas?|pg||
nt|dimi: +2?|pg||
nt|shevek: not impressed with the auction in the other room here|pg||
nt|dimi: NS made slam, great result should be down 2|pg||
nt|shevek: and we can't really blame east for not leading a @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: i am sure about the score, but not about the fact, how the declarer played in real, because it was too fast|pg||
nt|shevek: with the @cs 4-4 and the @d finesse on, 3NT won't be a problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: this is the 12 of 13 rounds|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sfoxa:  and if 2@d was with @d - this king is of full value|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The 2@D bid did not promise @Ds, but is 8+ HCP, so it was not as clear as one might think that all suits were well protected |pg||
nt|shevek: ah ok, np then|pg||
nt|shevek: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/bgt_2010/10_05_14_wer.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: allrite, wife not around, office would be off in half an hour, so good time to polish a tiny bit b4 on th way home, toast guys:) mebbe she tolerates..lol..around 90 degrees here, ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hell heat|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems big club family member 1@c opening|pg||
nt|jtr: Serefe!!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h serefe man, we love you David @h :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Roughly 75%. Can they bid it?|pg||
nt|caitlin: then why no 1@S bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: after 4@c cue, N should stop bidding slam...|pg||
nt|caitlin: if anyone in spec knows, let us know:)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rnmalik: Part of the game:)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Difficult without a fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: And we love Turkey|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkk: well, no risk no fun in Team...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: Susanne Bohnsack, playing on N, is the only women in the A-Group (10 Teams)|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: right|pg||
nt|sybarra: would you consider a super accept with W|pg||
nt|xenya: very hard, yes|pg||
nt|shevek: good dbl by west|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jtr: Was 1@s conventional?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|tomi2:  did he upgrade this 17 hcp to 18? or do they have other nt ranges?|pg||
nt|shevek: that says: not so keen for you to lead one pd |pg||
nt|shevek: undo pls|pg||
nt|shevek: Lukas?  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: the double means: I have a better idea than the @s lead...|pg||
nt|shevek: south bid 3@d in OR and made it easy |pg||
pc|sK|nt|h_karluk: my wife's origin is Donegal, and personally i love Ireland :) all neighbors around property near the sweet pond are here also Irish origin@H|pg||
nt|jtr: It might get awkward otherwise|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, that what I meant :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ahh could be conventional, kinda xfer with weakish values|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh really? We are close to Donegal|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's nice, all anchestors and relatives still there:) seriously|pg||
nt|jtr: 1@s denies a major probably|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is not good in short team match |pg||
nt|shevek: there goes 10 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: 3NT are no problem here|pg||
nt|shevek: the only problem was to bid it :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: all those spade pips work too|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk7: Right, you don't count hcp for @S1098, but they are worth gold|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: because he definitely wanted to play in @h suit|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jtr: oh ok|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: will be 1@d and 1@s for E|pg||
pc|s9|nt|juror2: 14-16 |pg||
nt|tomi2:  ok, thx|pg||
nt|friggi: yes for game - fast arrival prinsip|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tomi2:  this helped them to find this good game|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: i guess so|pg||
nt|shevek: now this contract has no play on ANY lead|pg||
pc|s8|nt|h_karluk: tx lukas for alert|pg||
nt|dimi: true, this is down 2 with best play|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: or W ;-)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sfoxa:  http://www.german-bridge-trophy.de/ - for results, but non-on-line|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: on in 3 @D so playing this to make |pg||
pc|dA|nt|jtr: I wonder how they show @ds|pg||
nt|cicus: this could even make one day but not today|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe they dont bother|pg||
nt|drewsky: not me...4 trip 3 , only 15 HCP, and my free 2@S bis clarifies 3+ as well|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h6|nt|dimi: can hold it to 1 down|pg||
nt|shevek: argument at the table Lukas?  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: south has claimed, but now he say he doesnt claimed|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, @ds don't run|pg||
nt|dimi: a kib said @h now, then it's 2 down i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: because east says, he wants one more...|pg||
nt|shevek: only one??|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: and now we have TD at table|pg||
nt|shevek: after claim declarer is not allowed to take any finesses|pg||
nt|dimi: NS hve enough tricks, it's only one down|pg||
nt|yuval10: one more seems reasonable, when S play K@d and see that W doesn't have any, he overtake in dummy and loses 1 for a claim|pg||
nt|dimi: yes|pg||
nt|shevek: guess he overtakes @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: and now we have -3|pg||
nt|shevek: true true|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|h_karluk: that's th question -- how to show @d|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2 more sounds quite weird|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: so perhaps there is a lesson here|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h5|pc|s7|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|rnmalik: One never know how weak P is for transfer and super accept make take the pair above board.|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|Walddk7: Well, you need a little more to be fair|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jtr: An Icelandic volcano erupted on Board 18|pg||
nt|h_karluk: strangely enough i did not see any exclusion yesterday and today, still a board to go and mebbe|pg||
nt|h_karluk: woohoo:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: excellent analogy:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: he explained after the 3@c bid, so then it was clear with the @c's...|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Clubs behaving or a squeeze for the 12th|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h9|pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: two pass and 3@h . hmm :) bothvul|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes but what will be the effect on our flights?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I ll bid what i think"|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c8|nt|h_karluk: I guess Zorlu thought " I|pg||
nt|cicus: of course, W will not discard any more major suit card|pg||
pc|c6|nt|h_karluk: i thought it wuz over sir|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah so maybe just no major initially|pg||
nt|jtr: Over me yes:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a favorable development:)|pg||
