mb|p|mb|1C|nt|patricck: Welcome everyone to the match between the Australian and New Zealand women's teams|pg||
nt|patricck: Both pairs are playing a fairly natural Acol based system|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|an| |mb|p|nt|patricck: Lachman and Snashall are 4 card majors while Cartner and Palmer are 5 card @S and 4 card @H (I think)|pg||
mb|1H|an| |mb|p|nt|patricck: At the moment New Zealand are in the lead in the Women's event, but it is still very close|pg||
nt|dburn: West might chance getting into the auction here|pg||
nt|dburn: rather to East's dismay, perhaps, but she doesn't have a bad hand for hearts|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dburn: or for defending against spades, given the chance|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|patricck: yes, I wonder if East can double 3@S or whether that would be responsive|pg||
nt|dburn: can't imagine making a responsive double in this kind of auction, but these days no one ever doubles anyone for penalty|pg||
nt|patricck: Both sides are playing 5 card majors, but Daniel and David Skipper play a weak NT |pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: The 1@D response to 1@C shows 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|patricck: and the 1@H bid should show exactly 3 card support|pg||
mb|2D|mb|3C|nt|patricck: David isn't going to let them play in their best spot, nice aggressive balance|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|patricck: lets hope that Daniel doesn't double this|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: pity, really, because this might have been 500 or so on a "nothing" kind of deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: double dummy nowwould be A@C and then J@C and declarer never gets to dummy again|pg||

nt|patricck: We are sure you'll manage somehow Stephen :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|dburn: this is the kind of thin game that gets bid more often than not these days|pg||
mb|2C|nt|patricck: Should be 4@H (or 5@D) EW. Wrong vulnerabiity for nS to be really interested in a sacrifice|pg||
mb|3C|nt|patricck: both pairs at this table using a weak NT|pg||
nt|patricck: Cue raise, because 3@H would just be pre-emptive, not invitational|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|patricck: not that he is inviting, just wan'ts to find more about partner's hand in case there is a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: Now 4@H may get him excited|pg||
mb|4N|nt|patricck: but Blackwood should put the brakes on, fortunately North can't get the lead to give South a @D ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: and gets made more often than it should - for example, if West plays 4@h and North (quite reasonably) leads a diamond, that will blow one trick|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|dburn: after which declarer needs only some good luck and some good guesses|pg||
nt|patricck: Cartner/Palmer in fact play (11)12-14, so East could even have opened 1NT but decided not to|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|patricck: Or does East bid 6@D to show 1 key card and a void....?  hmmm|pg||
mb|6H|nt|dburn: in that case, maybe East should have bid game, since partner won't play her for this much|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: Well lets see if declarer actually does make 10 tricks. I suspect not, because the normal way to play hearts is to finesse through North|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he did and he didn't|pg||
nt|patricck: I can see that he was hoping partner didn't have the A@C (the suit they had overcalled) but I still don't like pushing on to slam|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dburn: that is, he decided not to show his void in response to keycard, but then he bid a slam on the strength of his void anyway|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|patricck: If north has @HQ9xx you can pick it up, but not if South has the same holding|pg||
nt|dburn: well, she needs to ruff a club with one of East's trumps, which means that she might play South for the queen just for convenience|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, that's true|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: but I confess, my first move would have been a heart to the jack|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|dburn: which is why my partners don't put me in these thin games|pg||
nt|patricck: still, needed a lot, K@S onside and the trump guess, the 3-2 @H break as well, not to mention being given a @D trick on the lead|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, indeed - but bridge in the 21st century seems to be all about bidding and making God-awful game contracts|pg||
nt|dburn: in truth, though, West should probably not have taken another call over 4@h|pg||

nt|dburn: in a way - the actual Law is that if my opponents bid a game, I will take one of the finesses for them and the other two will work|pg||
nt|patricck: Perhaps easier if East bids 4@C in response to 3@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|an|9 - 12 5H|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|dburn: this is a better game, the kind a weak no trump is likely to miss|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure what all this means - maybe 2@d is Flannery|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, OK - it is some genetically engineered moscito|pg||
nt|vugraphzks: based on the Fantunes sytem I believe|pg||
nt|patricck: No, just undiscipline 5 card weak twos|pg||
nt|dburn: ah, OK|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly Fantunes play that 1@h is forcing and 2@h is a minimum opening with hearts|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@D is an interesting contract, but I don't think they'll rach that now|pg||
nt|vugraphzks: http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/ConventionCards/U26/New-Zealand/Skipper-Skipper.aspx for those that are interested|pg||
nt|dburn: in the good old days, they played that 1@h was always 14+, but they modified that when they had both majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzks: huge tank by Daniel|pg||

nt|patricck: occasion though I have hopes that New Zealand might have the edge this year|pg||
nt|dburn: could be a swing to NZ if South opens a strong no trump at the other table - they will bid 1NT-3NT and never know they had a problem|pg||
nt|patricck: I think the other table uses a weak NT too, but I'll check David|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|patricck: Interesting play problem here in 3NT on a spade lead|pg||
mb|1S|an| |mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|patricck: communication problem regardless of which suit you try to set up|pg||
nt|dburn: interesting bidding problem in any case - 5@d probably best|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dburn: of course, in the old days of Acol they bid 1@s-2@d-2NT-3NT and never knew they had a problem then either|pg||
nt|patricck: Aah, Shirley Newton and Jenny Wilkinson in the other room, they play Moscito, a strong club system with submarine openers|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: Their 1@C is in fact 15+, so their bidding could well reach game, North will probably be unable to restrain herself|pg||
nt|dburn: probably not, though restraint is generally to be recommended aboard submarines|pg||
nt|patricck: MY effort would be win A@S, cash 1@C and orertake the Q@D with the A@D, planning on 6@D, 1@C and 2@S, but the 4-1 diamond break would be my undoing|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|dburn: but if North bids 3NT now, South will almost certainly sit for it|pg||
nt|dburn: and of course I would lead a heart, not a spade, from the East chair|pg||
nt|patricck: that would definitely simplify matters for declarer, very easy then|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|dburn: naturally - that is what my opening leads invariably do|pg||
pc|h5|nt|patricck: we could never play together then David, one of us would have to find some good opening leads, and it certainly isn't me|pg||
nt|dburn: but should I ever have the privilege of a game with Daniel Skipper, at least he and I will start on a basis of mutual forgiveness|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|dburn: for example, if you are feeling hot, it is a good idea to restrain yourself from opening the window|pg||
