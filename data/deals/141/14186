mb|p|nt|roswolf: wrong slam in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzbv: this will be a big board for namsos however it ends|pg||
nt|yuval10: one might wonder what does a 2NT opening from W shows|pg||
nt|jokica: my thoughts |pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzbv: 4@H or 6@H i mean|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jokica: looks like W undergraded his hand bcos of the @d suit.. or this is 18-20 in their books :)|pg||
nt|jokica: this dbl is helpful|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@c possibly a check-back of any sort|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|roswolf: the e/w barrage was effective in the other room|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzbv: weird N didnt try 4@D|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed -- and you can't blame S for bidding 6@D i think|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yuval10: 3@c followed by 3@s probably set up a forcing situation|pg||
nt|yuval10: W showed no interest when he didn't cue-bid over 3@s|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jbgood: not at all - cred to EW in the CR|pg||

mb|p|nt|jokica: e/w play 1@D overcall|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZMS: 1D :)|pg||

nt|xenya: or 5?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbv: W sees taht @SQ is missing, but might try for the grand anyways(?)|pg||
nt|roswolf: should bid the slam imo|pg||
nt|roswolf: not the grand|pg||
nt|xenya: what does W know about partner's hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbv: i think bidding 6 is clearcut, so im wondering why he uses so much time here|pg||

nt|jbgood: Fat lady singing the blues now (on the radio), she knows that Namsos is Champs... and we might start singing "congratulations"!|pg||
nt|oliverc: maybe we'll still see 7@S here|pg||
nt|xenya: can E have 4 spades, for example?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and he wont get it right i predict|pg||
nt|oliverc: possibly|pg||
nt|vugraphzbv: if he bids 7, he needs to be wearing his guessing pants|pg||
nt|xenya: not a very convincing auction i fear |pg||
nt|roswolf: or south may show him his hand|pg||
nt|oliverc: Well perhaps more convincing if he'd just bid 6@S over 5@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: or a trump lead perhaps!?|pg||
