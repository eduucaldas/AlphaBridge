nt|cicus: admittedly, 4@H isn't a great contract|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|xenya: W should have ruffed with the 9, but perhaps that wouldn't have been safe on other layouts -- maybe the crossruff was not such a great idea after all  |pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|cicus: here, the target is 5@D for EW|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  NS need to stay low on this hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: ns may win the part score battle-- BOSS  suit|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|cicus: they can't compete above the 4 level, even 4@S is already -500|pg||
nt|psridhar: in this walsh age finding dia fit looks distant :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: now dia bids by E will get corrected to H ..|pg||
nt|cicus: I have to admit I'd have bid my @Ds as E - but they may have systemic reasons to bid @Hs first|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|psridhar: that 3S preemptive raise is very effective in these situations|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andyv:  almost did it:)|pg||
nt|xenya: N doesn't think so, Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  the difference between need and want:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this should have no play |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: with a game forcing hand the natural order is generally to be preferred|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes agree|pg||
pc|d9|nt|cicus: and it is clear E has a game force after partner opened|pg||
nt|psridhar: this game also has gud chances with trumps splitting 3-3|pg||
nt|psridhar: and that dia lead shd help, with no entry to N hand |pg||
nt|cicus: this contract is rather awkward on a spade lead but on this @D it will be easy|pg||
nt|cicus: even losing 2 trump tricks will not disturb declarer|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  agree with J@d play?|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@C is Polish -- usually a wek 1N -- but this time it was a strong hand -- curious that N elected to bid 4@H straightaway -- he had a number of other bids at his disposal with this ...|pg||
nt|xenya: hand  |pg||
nt|andyv:  I would think they would have some bid that would describe the N hand... maybe asking pd for one trick to go to 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzma: well he looks vry juniorish :)|pg||
nt|xenya: but perhaps 4@H is what is termed "a practical bid" |pg||
nt|andyv:  and N did buy a rather sad looking dummy as far as he's concerned|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|cicus: of course he will have to rely on a good trump break but he may as well assume it|pg||
nt|psridhar: after the support X ( by west) of 1s , the minor suit bids by E are normally played as long minor and denying 5 card H; but up to what level? does 4D here show 4h and 5D or ...|pg||
nt|psridhar: confirms 8 card h fit and slam try?|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, 4@D was an ambiguos bid - another reason to bid the long suit first|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|xenya: yes, Andy, to be fair, N needs little from partner for the game to be good |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psridhar: he now has the luxury of playing for 4-2 trumps and keep at dia|pg||
nt|cicus: trumps guessed, helped by the opps bidding, now E can relax|pg||

pc|dA|pc|s4|nt|psridhar: claim time|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: more importantly, there seems to be no way to find out intelligently if partner has the required cards|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c8|nt|cicus: now that trumps are 3-3, the opps cannot remove @H10, so aclub ruff will provide the 10th trick withot the @C finesse|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: nice hand for Blackwood here- if W knows his pd has 3 aces he can count 12 !|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: in normal breaks but 5-0 here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What about the trump loser?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 7@S is not even good if spades behave, on a diamond lead that is|pg||
nt|psridhar: trump loser makes it a cruel one :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That will remove a vital entry and you can no longer cope with clubs 4-2|pg||
nt|cicus: sry folks I missed there was still a trump on dummy so there was no risk taking the club finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6@S, however, can make in a couple of ways when you discover the awful trump break|pg||
nt|psridhar: true-the same problem exists in 6s -but 5-0 trump break is comepnsated by 3-3 cl|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You don't need clubs 3-3, there is a better line|pg||
nt|cicus: I'm not sure you can't make 7 on any lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can come down to J9 spades and a losing diamond|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: 2@S must be artificial game force|pg||
