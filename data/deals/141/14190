nt|jbgood: Sry about the misspelling, Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: well a chance for e/w to end on a high note|pg||

nt|oliverc: hand|pg||
nt|jokica: that was a costy board :)|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZMS: 4@s by E|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZMS: +1|pg||
nt|fifee: one spec pondered 2NT over 1@C. many pairs do not play that with an opening hand|pg||
nt|fifee: just weaker or strong |pg||

nt|sybarra: many of these players have 200+ pages of system notes |pg||
mb|3D|nt|isp: Heisann :)  God kveld :)|pg||
nt|isp: pass = strong pass ?|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZMS: hm, this looks strange|pg||
nt|rodal f: Small lines at bridge. Turn the hands for NS and EW are down or the sac 5@D bad|pg||
nt|rodal f: Multi |pg||
nt|isp: well ... but what is the meaning of pass by Boris ?!|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZMS: no, this board is rotated|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZMS: previous table returned cards wrong|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZMS: so, it's w who passed and n opened 2@d|pg||
nt|isp: ahaaa|pg||
nt|isp: Well guys ... we need a lot of imagination here :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: while the nots a lengthy,  it more that they have dicussed certain situations that the less established partnership has not |pg||
nt|sybarra: would you agree Pat?  they just talk about more "things" |pg||
nt|fifee: for sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: they have talked about what is forcing, what is not, what the cue bids could mean etc |pg||
mb|4D|nt|jbgood: :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|oliverc: nice hand to finish on|pg||
nt|vugraphzbv: 2nt here is one of my least favourite bids. should be used as 5-4+ minors, imo|pg||
nt|rodal f: So TD to come and1IMP pan for BG2 since N are responcible to check that all put back as they shall? The rule for tables by no screen, unscure with screens|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fifee: nothing like a nice long 2 week session to get the details ironed out with pd :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: almost surprised N didnt bid 5 @D immediately here |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|vugraphzbv: better to let the strong hand describe himself|pg||
nt|jbgood: or 5-5 |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: or 5 @C now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jokica: wasted pts in @S with N, believe he'll pass|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yuval10: and he did|pg||
nt|fifee: North is getting 2@S tricks, so probably thinks it is safer to double than bid|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jbgood: agree TorO|pg||
nt|jokica: nice lead - guess the spades now|pg||
nt|jokica: ah no, 10 missing too :)|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZMS: unfortunately he dont have 10 either|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|roswolf: yes 2@C AUCTIONS TEND TO BE BLUNT INSTRUMENTS|pg||
nt|xenya: stopping in 6 now?|pg||
nt|oliverc: so the A@C but no @S Q here|pg||
nt|xenya: or 5?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbv: W sees taht @SQ is missing, but might try for the grand anyways(?)|pg||
nt|roswolf: should bid the slam imo|pg||
nt|roswolf: not the grand|pg||
nt|xenya: what does W know about partner's hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbv: i think bidding 6 is clearcut, so im wondering why he uses so much time here|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|roswolf: trying|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting lead by E |pg||
pc|d9|nt|jokica: that's the think with multitasking :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: N might put the K of hts on the table?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d4|nt|oliverc: 5NT? wow :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: east should encourage|pg||
nt|jbgood: Fat lady singing the blues now (on the radio), she knows that Namsos is Champs... and we might start singing "congratulations"!|pg||
nt|oliverc: maybe we'll still see 7@S here|pg||
nt|xenya: can E have 4 spades, for example?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and he wont get it right i predict|pg||
nt|oliverc: possibly|pg||
nt|vugraphzbv: if he bids 7, he needs to be wearing his guessing pants|pg||
nt|xenya: not a very convincing auction i fear |pg||
nt|roswolf: or south may show him his hand|pg||
nt|oliverc: Well perhaps more convincing if he'd just bid 6@S over 5@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: or a trump lead perhaps!?|pg||
