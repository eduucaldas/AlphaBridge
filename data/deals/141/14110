nt|sfoxa:  with 2-2 trumps, can be made|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: and as it seems, it's hard to beat with 22 trumps..|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: needed @HA for opening lead and ruff|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: now it's 7 trumps and 5 diamonds |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and now all depend on N's decision - if he doesn't believe in @s 2-2...|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: yes, but he doesn't have other realistic chances... only singleton/doubleton @DJ|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: OK, @HQ onside and something good|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  something like that|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if trumps aren't 2-2, he may try to ruff 3 clubs, pitch 1 heart loser on @d and guess @h|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||

nt|zyxzewski: that was a bit strange...|pg||
nt|kastan88: after partner's preempt, probably @CA is not the best lead... but from @HAQ you don't lead either, most likely partner having @S singleton or void, not @H singleton|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  played for @d 3-3 or short jack?|pg||
mc|11|nt|zyxzewski: if the trumps are 3-1, then it is possible that even @DJ dropping is not good enough...|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: because you still have 2 losers|pg||
nt|kastan88: big mistake from North|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  anyway, such contracts are better to "play" from commentator's seat :-)|pg||
nt|kastan88: of course|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: counting tricks: 7 spades, 3 diamonds and well guessed heart = 11|pg||
nt|kastan88: we are not "mathematicians" as you Lauri, and North either :)|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: as you know, i am one of the few bridgeplayers who are not too good at math, but i do know how many tricks i must take playing in slam|pg||
nt|kastan88: and i am math teacher, who never can't count right :)|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: but declarers plan would have worked, if @S are 2-2 and @D drops or if @DJ drops second and the one who had it, does not have 3 trumps|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: maybe i have missed something, but seems like playing for trumps 2-2 and ruffing one diamond on road looks a bit better option|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: smoothly :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|zyxzewski: but finding 7 tricks may prove tricky|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|zyxzewski: although you have 23 pts, there are no tens and majors sit badly|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|zyxzewski: better than in spades indeed... but WE know, that diamonds are 3-3, and spades are not... endplay against Lond now?|pg||

nt|zyxzewski: sry, miscounted :)|pg||
mc|6|nt|zyxzewski: "it would have worked, if E couldn't have taken all the tricks" :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: as usual need to play 4-3 suit , where you have middle cards, not quick tricks :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: even without knowing what suit is 33|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: holding AK, it guarantees you some control, if things go very bad, but yes, generally you are right|pg||
nt|kastan88: and for last 2 boards in this session will coming Estonian pair vilmar Vahe - Marek Kolk|pg||
