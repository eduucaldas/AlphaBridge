mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|roswolf: pass or correct - please|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: blood will flow|pg||

nt|jokica: 2nt opening with 22pts? or are those times behind us... that would work here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbv: no way E will find @C lead|pg||

nt|vugraphzbv: looking at the results from closed it is evident that EW have a good round, all scores but one are plusses|pg||

nt|rodal f: At the team filal in Norway a good comment came.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am very sympathetic to N  |pg||
mb|3N|nt|rodal f: A pair ended 6@S by missing AJ109XX. So hopeless contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: good question whether 2 @D would have been natural |pg||
mb|p|nt|jokica: 3nt is in on a careful play in spades, but 5@D is on a claim |pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: and another question is do you want to play it there  Red v white? |pg||
nt|yuval10: tough decision for S in the 2nd round of the bidding - 3@d can be an option too|pg||

nt|fifee: one spec pondered 2NT over 1@C. many pairs do not play that with an opening hand|pg||
nt|fifee: just weaker or strong |pg||

nt|VUGRAPHZMS: no, this board is rotated|pg||

nt|isp: ahaaa|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: while the nots a lengthy,  it more that they have dicussed certain situations that the less established partnership has not |pg||
nt|sybarra: would you agree Pat?  they just talk about more "things" |pg||
nt|fifee: for sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: they have talked about what is forcing, what is not, what the cue bids could mean etc |pg||
mb|4S|nt|jbgood: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|oliverc: nice hand to finish on|pg||
nt|vugraphzbv: 2nt here is one of my least favourite bids. should be used as 5-4+ minors, imo|pg||
nt|rodal f: So TD to come and1IMP pan for BG2 since N are responcible to check that all put back as they shall? The rule for tables by no screen, unscure with screens|pg||
mb|d|nt|fifee: nothing like a nice long 2 week session to get the details ironed out with pd :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: almost surprised N didnt bid 5 @D immediately here |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzbv: better to let the strong hand describe himself|pg||
nt|jbgood: or 5-5 |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: or 5 @C now?|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite an interesting X here|pg||
nt|yuval10: imaginative one may say|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jokica: wasted pts in @S with N, believe he'll pass|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yuval10: and he did|pg||
nt|fifee: North is getting 2@S tricks, so probably thinks it is safer to double than bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: the K@h onside means easy 10 tricks for declarer and perhaps more|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jbgood: agree TorO|pg||
nt|jokica: nice lead - guess the spades now|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes and he wont get it right i predict|pg||
nt|oliverc: possibly|pg||

nt|roswolf: or south may show him his hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|VUGRAPHZMS: he's confident in his partner's declaring skills :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would u bidded 2@S as the last bidder Ilko?|pg||
nt|fifee: super accept by Mandzo|pg||
nt|jokica: 3nt looks cold as @hs split with 3rd jack falling|pg||

mb|4H|nt|fifee: but pd did not want to hear it this time|pg||
nt|fifee: could that super accept have them in trouble?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: perhaps he can try to develope his own skills and bid 3NT? :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|rodal f: S don't have for 4@S and N might could used a better tool then 3@S, if he is to bid at all. On the edge at N|pg||
nt|yuval10: would've been more logical than 4@s, even though it won't be making either|pg||
nt|yuval10: this lead might enable declarer to make 4@h, too|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andreasw:  would u accept the invit here?|pg||
