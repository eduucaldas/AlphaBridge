mb|p|nt|ahollan1: well now   3rd/4th seat 1@C=16+      1N=ART, a) 9-12 HCP, 2+ controls, BAL [include 5@C/@D(332)  b) 6-9 HCP, 1-suit 5+@H [bad suit else opening bid]|pg||
mb|2S|nt|patricck: 11 tricks EW and 9 tricks NS, so par is 5@S doubled down 2, but this is a game of who can push who|pg||
nt|patricck: West had a lot for that raise to 2@H, does East know how good he is?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pretty sure PASS is relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|alanz: I can provide some commentary on Newell/Reid system|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|patricck: I really don't like West's bidding. First raising to only 2@H and then passing 4@S but overruling partner to take it out into 5@H.|pg||
nt|patricck: It actually turns out to be the right action, but that is not the point|pg||
nt|vugraphzks: director being called|pg||
nt|patricck: I'm guessing that it would be obvious that East made a slow double and then West decided to take it out|pg||
nt|patricck: :)But I have been wrong about that sort of thing before :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S!|nt|alanz: Good one!|pg||
mb|3S|nt|patricck: New Zealand need a strong finish here to have a chance in this match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=ART, 9-13 HCP, unbal, 4+@D, not 4+@H/@S a) 6+@D  b) @D & @C [maybe longer @C]|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: South had to find a bid, but it may well turn a plus into a minus|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: W too weak to bid it.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|shinge: 4H or 4S? - getting dark here !!|pg||
nt|psridhar: W has an ACE -rarely gud strategy to pass a Std 1 bid with it|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|patricck: It isn't going to be hard to find the @H switch|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: And passing 3@S on the North cards would have been a fairly scary option|pg||
nt|psridhar: both 4h/4s can make|pg||
mb|d|nt|patricck: Hmm, dummy had AQ@D and nothing in @H, what shall I do|pg||

nt|ahollan1: so 4@S was a good decision because defense slipped|pg||
mc|10|nt|psridhar: Note that Michael passed a 13 count with a good club suit-consideration is (1) aceless hand (2) passed pd (3) minor suit-good judgement i like his style|pg||

mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|patricck: THe 2@C is a regular game force, so that is fairly aggressive. North can bid 2@S to show a 5+ suit with 8+ points so I'm not quite sure why they would just bid 2@D|pg||
