nt|szalay: so segment score is 21-21, i believe|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: another chance for old men|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: will they get to 4@S ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks to all involved, especially to Róbert Szemere who has been instrumental in organising these broadcasts|pg||
nt|szalay: what wd u bid over 3@C?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahh: hate the problem  :)|pg||
nt|szalay: with nonpassed pd @D is an option, but wd go for sure plus with passed pd AND NV|pg||
mb|3N|nt|szalay: nonpassed: DBL is option|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lots more vugraph soon. The Reisinger in about 30 minutes, and of course the last segment of this match after the dinner break|pg||
nt|ahh: 3@D is underbid  x  could be awful if p has @H|pg||
nt|szalay: 3N is an option as well:-)|pg||
nt|ahh: losing 1 though|pg||
nt|jtr: 3Nt not nice with A single|pg||
nt|szalay: Juniors hope is: East isnt hungry yet:-)|pg||
nt|Vugraph171: Our next planned vugrpah is the final of the Team's Championship|pg||
nt|szalay: if u have strong 64, nothing is 'nice', imho|pg||
nt|szalay: if East is hungry, things can be terrible for them...|pg||
nt|ahh: i suppose 4@C  is another option  if p bids @S  its ok if he bids @H  you bid 5@D  i guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c8|nt|gal: 4@c for them is 55 in diamonds and a major|pg||
nt|ahh: would tend to have better @S for that bid  but when in a fix .....|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahh: swing to juniors |pg||
nt|szalay: it was quite normal, but unlucky..if my calculation is ok, Juniors won this segment 26-21, so we r leading by 82|pg||
