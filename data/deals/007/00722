nt|reisig: This match was VERY close ...now just close|pg||
nt|tsanders: Richie, did Italy win some imps during the break?|pg||
nt|reisig: Looks that way|pg||
nt|tsanders: possible that the operator had the score wrong before break|pg||
nt|reisig: I hear there was an appeal - won by Italy (12 IMPs)|pg||
nt|migry: it was an appeal i think|pg||
nt|tsanders: please be patient now, Closed Room has to wait for comparisons|pg||

nt|lrargerich: Either QJ onside or diamonds 3-3 produce 4 tricks|pg||

nt|eggy: or no money :)|pg||
nt|eggy: GBS?|pg||
nt|dburn: The senitments expressed above are not mine. They have been variously attributed to Shaw and Clemenceau, who are both dead, so that not even the Republicans can sue them :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Synchronise your watches...|pg||
nt|offthebend: This match is too close to call like the US election - though Bush and Italy are favorites|pg||

nt|offthebend: Hello Dave, Hi David|pg||
nt|mrdct: as soon as we have some player names up, system cards can be found at http://www.bridgebase.com/istanbul/|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was amazed by aggressive bidding (overbidding...) by the Italians yesterday. Let's see if they always bid like that.|pg||
nt|mrdct: aggressive bridge tends to be winning bridge|pg||
nt|mrdct: the official WBF site is http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Istanbul.04/Istanbul.htm but last time I checked it still didn;t have today's bulletin and is missing lots of other key ...|pg||
nt|mrdct: info|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Hi all ! start in 10 mns...|pg||
nt|mrdct: fantoni-nunes play 5-card majors with sound (14+) one-level openings, 10-13 unbalanced natural openings at the two-level and a 12-14 1NT opening|pg||
nt|brolucius: Where are you, Subhash, in Istanbul or at home?|pg||
nt|offthebend: I am at home in New Delhi|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm just having a read of EW's card now. it can be found at http://www.bridgebase.com/istanbul/|pg||
nt|brolucius: How are the Tandoori Prawns at the Frontier Restaurant?!|pg||
nt|offthebend: you have to come here to taste them !!|pg||
nt|brolucius: My wife and I already did|pg||
nt|offthebend: were they spicy enough for you ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: shi-zhuang are playing a 5-card majors natural system with a 14-17 NT (which can be offshape) and multi-twos. Their 2@D opening is a weak two in either major without a strong ...|pg||
nt|mrdct: option|pg||
nt|mrdct: in bridge, like many other sports, china are very much a sleeping giant that has well and truly woken up|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's great to see China (and Russia) in both semi-finals. Congratulations to them!|pg||
nt|offthebend: So how many aggressive bidders will make a game try with East's hand over a raise ?|pg||
nt|ritong: please welcome tim bourke  from  australia  hiya, tim :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: Hi Tim|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi Tim|pg||

nt|lrargerich: Hi all|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Welcome all|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi! 54 IMPs behind with 32 boards to play is worrying, but not desperate. |pg||
nt|brolucius: Better to hope for some good boards, rather than go mad with eccentric bids. Let's see what happens!|pg||
nt|brolucius: And if you're only 45 IMPs behind the situation is even better...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi Luis!|pg||
nt|murad: .|pg||
nt|murad: Hello and welcome specs and fellow commentators :-)|pg||

nt|brolucius: Great effort from Russia (and China) to reach both semi-finals. Congratulations to them.|pg||
nt|ritong: well, guys  wish you fun  leave you now :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: Indeed. Let's hope for some boards to make these last 2 segments a real good fight :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: Ty Henri|pg||
nt|murad: Unfortunately (for some of us), Turkey paved the way for Russia to reach this stage|pg||
nt|brolucius: Generous hosts!|pg||
nt|murad: Indeed, we offered the match on a silver platter :-))|pg||
nt|brolucius: Cinar tells me that Russia beat Turkey by only 7 IMPs. Painful!|pg||
nt|brolucius: It shows how lucky England were to lose to Pakistan by a full 37... |pg||
nt|copeyj: Was just thinking the same thing :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I wouldn't mind waiting so long if the first board didn't look so DULL!|pg||
nt|murad: not the kind of deal Russians would expect|pg||
nt|murad: unless, of course, one side gets excited|pg||
nt|ritong 3: sorry all .  our toy is marvelous, but sometimes er...temperamental?|pg||
nt|stewball: hi everyone|pg||

nt|thekid1: china is hanging in there against the best in the world|pg||

nt|udo: hallo all , greetings from Munich|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi Bart, very impressed with your early analysis of the two-suit double squeeze in the Italy-USA match the other day! |pg||
nt|mrdct: that will give us plenty of time to intro this final between italy and the netherlands|pg||
nt|roghog: Bart, nice to talk to you again. and hi to our lovely viewers @H|pg||
nt|bbramley: thanks, david, i hope we see more deals like that today|pg||
nt|brolucius: We will leave all such complex analysis to you...|pg||
nt|mrdct: versace-lauria vs. prooijen-brink in the open room - still awaiting line-ups for this room|pg||
nt|roghog: specs always put us right if we get the analysis wrong :-)|pg||
nt|mrdct: for holand it will be schollaardt-drijver in this room|pg||
nt|roghog: perhaps I should say ... when we get it wrong!|pg||
nt|roghog: David vs. Goliath here. Any chance for the Dutch???|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Hi all !!...Start in about 9 mns and 13 sec ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Always a chance in a final. They must have played excellently to reach this stage. |pg||
nt|mrdct: in the round-robin match it was a 15-15 VP tie between thse two teams|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think 1 imp to italy from memory|pg||
nt|roghog: if you go by history, the Dutch will win. after all, David DID beat Goliath!!|pg||
nt|ritong: hello and welcome all :-)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Throwing stones is not allowed here|pg||
nt|mrdct: and italy would be quite pleased to repeat that result|pg||

nt|bbramley: i looked their RR match yesterday.  45-45 tie, according to the BBO record.|pg||
nt|mrdct: the dutch pair are playing 5-card majors with a short 1@C, 14-17 1NT and multi twos|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Hi all !! Match will start at board 17 in 10 mns :)|pg||
nt|ritong: hello everybody  :)  your commentators for this set will be  jon  sveindal  from norway & richard reisig  from  USA|pg||

nt|lrargerich: Hi all!|pg||
nt|stewball: hi everyone|pg||
nt|dburn: Good evening from Istanbul|pg||
nt|offthebend: hi all , welcome to the 3rd segment of this close final|pg||
nt|offthebend: Looking at the last hand of the last set - Versace /Lauria don't play some kind of Drury -3H down100|pg||
nt|stewball: the trend from Italy/China is continuing...every session score very close with Italy building small leads each time|pg||
nt|ritong: hello everybody :-)  your  commentators will be  subhash gupta  from india , john stewart  from canada, luis argerich  from  argentina  and  mark  thiele  from  netherland|pg||

nt|ritong: okay  guys   have  fun :-)|pg||
nt|stewball: hi mark,luis and subhash|pg||
nt|stewball: mark can be our systems guy|pg||
nt|offthebend: Board 1 - normal 3NT, C10 lead , lauria may go down as the cards are.H lead also works quite well|pg||
nt|mthiele: Hi all, lets hope for a good round for the dutchies :)|pg||
nt|stewball: in Canada a dutchie is a doughnut|pg||
nt|mthiele: oh :)|pg||
nt|stewball: with jam in the middle:)|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Actually 3NT is cold on any lead|pg||
nt|offthebend: we can also root for a bad round from Italians ??|pg||
nt|offthebend: Guess the spades right among other things -yes|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Hi folks...start in 5mns 13 sec..|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Let's see the play|pg||
nt|lrargerich: If they lead a heart to the Ace and a heart back|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Jack, queen|pg||
nt|lrargerich: The defense clear hearts|pg||
nt|lrargerich: And now on the spade ace declarer MUST unblock the s9 or he is down|pg||
nt|offthebend: I bet 3N going minus on a C lead|pg||
nt|lrargerich: On a club lead declarer must take the club ace at trick down to win 3NT|pg||
nt|lrargerich: He is down if he plays low from dummy|pg||
nt|offthebend: N can always duck the second C to maintain communication|pg||
nt|brolucius: Welcome, everyone!|pg||
nt|brolucius: 38 IMPs is not insurmountable, as the Russian ladies showed us yesterday|pg||
nt|ritong: hello and welcome :)  your commentators will be david bird & david burn from england   seconded by jon sveidal  from  norway|pg||
nt|dburn: Shouldn't that be thirded?|pg||
nt|dburn: Good afternoon from Istanbul|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't know the Italian lineup, but Norberto Bocchi is sitting opposite me in the press room, which may be a clue|pg||
nt|ritong: i spared you twiddledee & twiddledum:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Dutch team are incredibly young. Unfair that they should play so well in their 20s|pg||
nt|brolucius: Jansma-Verhees are in their early 40s, a kibitzer tells me, the others in their 20s|pg||
nt|dburn: Jansma and Verhees are in their forties. Maybe they will play twice as well.|pg||
nt|ritong: wlc jon sveindal|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: and tu|pg||
nt|ritong: :-)|pg||
nt|brolucius: In that case, David, I should play 3 times as well|pg||
nt|mcphee: some sex changes in the last segment?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi everyone! You are watching the right match.|pg||
nt|brolucius: An exciting climax (we hope) to a fantastic women's final|pg||
nt|brolucius: A 17-IMP swing in 6@D on the last board of the previous set has kept the Americans in the hunt|pg||
nt|mcphee: Russian ladies have been preforming very well|pg||
nt|roghog: hi folks|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was commentating yesterday, on the set where the Russians put up a 67-0 lead. They played very courageously.|pg||
nt|ritong: hello & welcome all :-)|pg||
nt|mcphee: 35 imps is not an insurmountable task|pg||
nt|roghog: have USA brought in Fantunes to help??|pg||
nt|brolucius: The answer is not to panic if you lose an early swing. 35 is a big cushion.|pg||
nt|mcphee: these are the cross dressers|pg||
nt|roghog: I'm in the right room, then :-)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The (wrong) names will be fixed very quickly|pg||
nt|ritong: hello all|pg||
nt|mcphee: welcome Roger Bryant, and David Bird of England, I'm Bob from the northern woods of Canada|pg||
nt|ritong: your commentators :  david bird & roger bryant  from england, bob  mcphee from  canada|pg||
nt|roghog: talking of wrong names, David, I see you didnt choose TheAbbott as your nick...|pg||
nt|ritong: yeah, i noticed that too:)|pg||
nt|roghog: remind us, is BroLucius the clever one?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Someone else pinched 'Abbot' and 'The Abbot' first. Same on AOL!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, the clever one, but don't expect too much|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hurray, the names are coming...|pg||
nt|swanson: sure|pg||
nt|mcphee: Montin and Myers well expirienced at this level|pg||
nt|ritong: welcome to john swanson  USA  hi john:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: hi John|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi John!|pg||
nt|swanson: Hi All|pg||
nt|ritong: okay  folks  have fun !|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is the Russian pair that I watched yesterday. They impressed me.|pg||
nt|swanson: What has been happening to my relatives? Is Russia playing super?|pg||
nt|brolucius: You will see in a moment how they play...|pg||
nt|roghog: Polish 1@c vs. modified Standard American|pg||
nt|brolucius: If I remember right, this is a board from yesterday|pg||
nt|szalay: hi all|pg||
nt|ritong: hello all :)  your commentators will be tim bourke  from australia ,gyorgy szalay  from  hungary  & wayne burrows  from  new zealand|pg||
nt|timb: hi everyone|pg||
nt|szalay: hi all|pg||
nt|szalay: I bet French pair play French 5-card major, Bulgarians probably precision|pg||
nt|szalay: -40 isn't much...especially if teams are playing different sys and Great Shuffler will be in good shape:-)|pg||
nt|cascade: Operator do you know how long until we start?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|roghog: against either, you try (if you can) to bounce the auction to stop the 1@c-er defining his hand. could be some action!!|pg||
nt|lrargerich: And he has to guess diamonds |pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@S - 1NT - 2NT - 3NT was the bidding|pg||
nt|shurik: Hi all|pg||
nt|roghog: All the Convention Cards are on http://www.bridgebase.com/istanbul|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mrdct: we are away!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roghog: natural GF|pg||
nt|ritong: okay, herve will start soon   c'est parti!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Zhuang may open East hand 1NT, rather than 1S, to avoid a rebid problem|pg||
nt|murad: looks like we have some action|pg||
nt|mrdct: bocchi-duboin play 5-card majors with a variable 1NT opening, weak twos and transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: What are the players' heart rates as they take their seats? 120?  140?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi, Jon|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: the winning team gets to pick it's opp next round|pg||
nt|roghog: 120 , 140 are they scores or heart-rates?|pg||
nt|ritong: here we go   have fun, folks !:)|pg||
nt|cascade: Looks like we are starting welcome everyone - Hi Gyorgy and Tim|pg||
nt|szalay: nice start for Bulgaria! 2@H was modified Norwegian toy: bot majors, weak|pg||
mb|3S|nt|gcohler: and is there carryover if these two teams later meet?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|gcohler: 3 ht is a big big bid here|pg||
nt|cherilou: I don't know|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Your commentarors for this match are Cheri Bjerkan, Gary Cohler, USA, Jon Sveindal, Norway, and Vivianne Lechtman, Venezuela|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to you|pg||
nt|cherilou: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|mrdct: system cards: http://www.bridgebase.com/istanbul/|pg||
nt|timb: this is how the closed room in the closed room began - cost Nunes-Fantoni 300|pg||
nt|timb: in open final|pg||
nt|szalay: especially good news: 3N is down, IMHO|pg||
nt|timb: with 3NT down 2 in the other room for 9 to netherlands|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: hi Roland|pg||
nt|eggy: good morning everyone, welcome to this revised schedule England vs Pakistan (who england chose as opponents)|pg||
nt|nils123: hi :-)|pg||
nt|murad: the dutch are unlikely to enter the bidding after a natural 1S by Doubinine|pg||
mb|4S|nt|eggy: But England now need a serious recovery to make a match of it|pg||
nt|kareno: Good morning all!  A practical auction and a makeable contract with the loss of only three club tricks.|pg||
nt|eggy: if you want to see the players system cards, you can find them on www.bridgebase.com/istanbul |pg||
nt|kareno: I'm assuming the trump shift once south starts playing on clubs, if he does.|pg||
nt|thor17: Guess names are coming...|pg||
nt|nils123: seems like berthau-nystrøm ew|pg||
nt|nils123: the sweedes needs some imps, lets hope they dont bid 7h mising KQJ today|pg||
nt|thor17: is this the last segment of the match??|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW's methods include an offshape 1NT opening|pg||
nt|offthebend: So, do we see shades of the famed Blue team in this current Italian team to dominate for few years|pg||
nt|dburn: Lest there shoud be any doubt: Jansma is 42, Verhees is 40, Drijver is 24, Schollardt is 27, Brink is 23 and van Prooijen is 31|pg||
mb|p|nt|roghog: N knows his partner has an opening-strength hand with @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: Great for them to have three strong pairs and no weak link|pg||
nt|cascade: did Stefanov have some doubt there about passing|pg||
nt|szalay: it could be 500 with perfect bidding|pg||
nt|szalay: defence|pg||
nt|timb: the question is should one overcall 3@C on this hand opposite a passed partner? Where is the upside?|pg||
mb|p|nt|nils123: yes|pg||
nt|udo: looks like a routine 3 SA here, quiet one to start|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 16 boards in the women's event|pg||
nt|nils123: 16 boards to go, trailing by 30.... not a good feeling|pg||
nt|ahh: hi all|pg||
nt|lrargerich: What is 2NT ?, probably 2@s artificial?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|curtis: Yo|pg||
nt|thor17: Yo to you too|pg||
nt|nils123: yo curtis|pg||
nt|udo: best contract reached in a hurry ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: this contract looks hopeless|pg||
nt|murad: well well|pg||
nt|stewball: I'm betting a coke on Fantoni,,any takers?|pg||
nt|offthebend: you are on along with a donut|pg||
nt|lrargerich: On Fantoni down 1 ? |pg||
nt|mthiele: the dutch play 'orange club' which is derived of the 'polish club' where 1@c = 12-14 balanced or 16+ with @c or a strong hand|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@c was clubs or 15+balanced. 1@d showed hearts.|pg||
nt|dburn: Brother Lucius is 94|pg||
nt|brolucius: A walking encyclopedia|pg||
nt|dburn: and 3NT is cold, so this is a quiet start to the fourth segment|pg||
nt|brolucius: Have you forgotten your own age? We haven't heard that yet|pg||
nt|dburn: I am well into my dotage. I expect I was born sometime, but I can't recall when, or indeed why.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The 'why' is so you can commentate on this final|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roghog: don't know. can specs help?|pg||
nt|lrargerich: This is not a very sophisticated sequence|pg||
nt|lrargerich: For a pair playing a club system this lookw rusty|pg||
nt|offthebend: This contract is doomed despite the fav lead.C shift sooner or later|pg||
nt|dburn: so Jansma will probably lead diamonds|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Helpful lead |pg||
nt|dburn: That must have been it.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Nice lead by Fantoni but it will not be enough|pg||
nt|jbgood: he will have to let a @h go when running clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: Jansma and Verhees use a system based on Polish Club|pg||
nt|dburn: FIve-card majors, strong no trump, 1@c mulit-meaning, mostly natural|pg||
nt|dburn: Fantoni and Nunes use a method of their own that is unique in top-level bridge|pg||
pc|dT|nt|nils123: 3h is an interesting contract|pg||
nt|ahh: so  ireland have reasonable lead can they hold on |pg||
nt|ahh: i am asked how ireland gained 15 overnight  there must have been an appeal however i do not know the details|pg||
nt|thor17: this Swedish pair is active by nature..expect will be even more active now (3H bid = early evidence)|pg||
nt|nils123: with a club lead he is close to make....|pg||
nt|ahh: nystrom cant be thinking of bidding?|pg||
nt|thor17: might pull here with unfortunate result|pg||
nt|nils123: must be... at least he has 7 @D... lol|pg||
nt|curtis: don't see it|pg||
nt|vugraph196: nystrom is thinking|pg||
nt|nils123: club lead he rise with Q and play new club... will be interesting play|pg||
nt|curtis: not like he doesn't have a decent hand for partner jumping in like that|pg||
nt|ahh: sweaty 1st board whatever happens|pg||
nt|thor17: he backed in, didnt "jump in":)|pg||
nt|ahh: longer he thinks more likely he will bid|pg||
nt|thor17: indeed|pg||
nt|curtis: I'll be more careful with my verbs|pg||
nt|nils123: well, he could also balance dbl, so no need to run with 98 in support i thk|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|mcphee: good day everyone|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahh: lost my 1st bet :)|pg||
nt|nils123: he avoided the club lead, now i guess they beat it for sure|pg||
nt|curtis: finding the tap suit immediately|pg||
nt|thor17: could get very ugly now for Bertheau|pg||
nt|nils123: not very.... |pg||
nt|nils123: very ugly was 7hx-3, this is just early morning exersice|pg||
nt|nils123: would u dbl 3@h on south hand?|pg||
nt|thor17: i missed the 7Hx so ugliness is all relative :)|pg||
nt|curtis: yep - huge upside|pg||
nt|nils123: berhau is picturing the lay out of the hands.... not sure he finds out|pg||
nt|curtis: 7H from yesterday was by Fredin-Lindkvist.  B-N defended game|pg||
nt|curtis: A10x facing xxxxx|pg||
nt|stewball: 1020 coming |pg||
nt|ritong: first deals can be weird, due to "board-lag"  think things will be normal soon|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi Udo and all, any idea of who are playing at this table?|pg||
nt|stewball: i dont see who is sitting where?|pg||
nt|ritong: not yet, jon :)|pg||
nt|ritong: herve will fill in soon|pg||
nt|udo: no sy, i have CC s of two üairs and wait for the names|pg||
nt|stewball: looks like the dutch are N/S here|pg||
nt|ritong: you are most welcome, jon :-)|pg||
nt|jbgood: tu|pg||
nt|stewball: sorry E/W|pg||
nt|brolucius: Very bold and risky protection by West.|pg||
nt|ritong 3: jan " the squirrel" jansma can take unexpected positions:)|pg||
nt|murad: trump switch may set|pg||
nt|dburn: and that will mean that the coke investors had better put their money on declarer|pg||
nt|offthebend: Jansma took all the fun away  |pg||
nt|dburn: All opening bids at the one level are forcing; 1@c natural or balanced, others natural|pg||
nt|timb: if partner hadn't passed, 3@C is clear|pg||
pc|s2|nt|nils123: i know i commentated it... but for me a sweede is a sweede.. lol|pg||
nt|timb: a club shift is coming|pg||
nt|roghog: I think our viewers have settled in, soWelcome to live bridge from Istanbul. This is the final of the 12th World Olympiad.  This is the first of eight 16-board stanzas|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many thanks to BBO for giving us the chance to watch this action|pg||
nt|cascade: exactly |pg||
pc|sA|nt|gcohler: should be down 1|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|cherilou: Feels like E had her 4@H bid but they're down 1 and 3@S was down 1|pg||
nt|ahh: it was great fun :)|pg||
nt|curtis: you all look alike to us|pg||
nt|thor17: I assume the KQJ were not singleton|pg||
nt|curtis: scandinavians|pg||
nt|inquiry: the @HT9 doubleton gives a second way to 12 tricks... this should make even if norht goes for @Ds.....|pg||
nt|lrargerich: They play in 6NT is quite interesting|pg||
nt|inquiry: instead of clubs|pg||
nt|lrargerich: I think it's right to go for diamonds instead of clubs|pg||
nt|lrargerich: If you make 4 diamond tricks you don't need the heart finesse|pg||
nt|lrargerich: I'm told a Pakistani declarer went down on the @hT lead|pg||
nt|roghog: agreed|pg||
nt|inquiry: yes and with @D spots, best is @DKA incase doubleton... honor... but when WEST shows out, the lucky heart situation sees you home....|pg||
nt|roghog: 10@h looks a sensible lead. Sz probably asking about the auction|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS will have a few chances to get it right too|pg||
nt|murad: well done by Gromov|pg||
nt|szalay: may be pass and 3@C reopen is better if they sign off (rather 2@S: south has many @Hs|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kareno: And with both clubs onside as well as both diamonds, an overtrick is possible.  South is playing for the diamond jack in west, playing for safety.|pg||
nt|eggy: Yes,declater can see 10 tricks with the favourable @D position and doesn't want to risk a ruff|pg||
nt|ahh:  for this match i am honorary irishman  |pg||
nt|roghog: expert commentator wrong again!!|pg||
nt|stewball: i'm directionally challeneged|pg||
nt|dburn: Tow-level openings are intermediate, about 9-13 hcp|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gcohler: now they casn make it needed d shift from other hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|copeyj: Good afternoon everyone :-)|pg||
nt|curtis: hi Bob|pg||
nt|nils123: i know, handsome blonde scandinavians, all look the same... lol|pg||
nt|curtis: I guess he plays spades now and then runs them through North|pg||
nt|nils123: wow 7C ...|pg||
nt|ahh: hairy redhead celts all the same too|pg||
nt|curtis: I'm switching to icelandic|pg||
nt|thor17: Careful Nils...Ekeblad is Swedish...being 5 generations removed from the homeland, I am almost "cured" :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: North will have to pitch a heart on 5th club|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|cherilou: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: she makes du to the fact that thre hearts are with three clubs|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Now this is ice-cold|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|stewball: thnks to the 100 specs who pointed this out to me...lol|pg||
nt|mrdct: probably 3 or 4 doen now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer might have cashed AK of diamonds, just in case the queen fell.|pg||
nt|mrdct: today's bulletin is available from http://www.tbricfed.org.tr/newsite/docs/bul_11%20600dpi.pdf|pg||
nt|offthebend: He could have played on D before S - may be the luck with DQ dropping|pg||
nt|mrdct: same contract in the open room|pg||
nt|roghog: typical Bocchi overcall. always costs me 500...|pg||
nt|udo: @H now ?|pg||
nt|bbramley: italians are very aggressive overcalling, even with bad suits|pg||
nt|timb: @D8 looks obvious|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahh: swedes not lucky in 7  next time may have ace of trumps :)|pg||
nt|inquiry: well.. this lead given the bidding seems wrong|pg||
nt|szalay: as to take it with ace|pg||
pc|h6|nt|murad: down now|pg||
nt|bbramley: good morning everyone|pg||
pc|h8|nt|nils123: must have been an interesting bidding in other room.... 7@C, only 2 down..|pg||
pc|h9|nt|dburn: and a spectator tells me that I am to refer to the Dutch system as the "Orange Club"|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|kareno: Now he'll make only ten tricks. |pg||
nt|nils123: lol, yes ace is absolutely recomended when bid 7|pg||
nt|ahh: anyhow great start for ireland|pg||
nt|thor17: looking at 42+ deficit after this hand|pg||
nt|nils123: i know, there are alot of x-scandinavians in usa, half of the country mooved, only the good stayed.. hehe|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dburn: At the other table, after a strong no trump and Stayman sequence, South is less likely to lead diamonds (though may still do so)|pg||
nt|mthiele: fantoni will play @s correct now|pg||
nt|offthebend: Not a great start for the Dutch,I am afraid|pg||
nt|dburn: I am told that South for Italy has led a heart, so if you want to back the defence, that is the table to visit|pg||
nt|offthebend: Plus 10 for Italy|pg||
nt|mthiele: grr|pg||
nt|dburn: Not necessarily. Declarer may still make the contract on a heart lead, but it will not be so easy.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|nils123: spade to ruff and hk now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|offthebend: He is settling for down two|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|thor17: Lot of Norwegians too..Karl Rolvaag(sp?) told their whole story|pg||
nt|nils123: 2 down i guess?|pg||
nt|mthiele: on a heartlead declarer has to make a lot of good decisions|pg||
pc|d7|nt|roghog: seems to work for them, though|pg||
nt|szalay: good endplay!|pg||
nt|szalay: wd, Cathrine|pg||
nt|ritong: bienvenue a pierre yves guillaumin  salut, PY|pg||
nt|szalay: salut|pg||
nt|timb: down one is excellent|pg||
nt|pyg: bonjour à tous|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lrargerich: Yes, natural 2@d and 5@d forbid the diamond lead|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|brolucius: That's the same pattern as yesterday. The declaring side bid forwardly but the defence is tight.|pg||
nt|offthebend: It should not be a big loss-knowing the aggressive Italians|pg||
nt|mrdct: it will reasonable stragy for the chinese to match the italians' aggression|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|nils123: maybe they can hold him to 6 now?|pg||
nt|roghog: yes. 2@d is definitely natural GF|pg||

nt|jtr: but with very tough defence|pg||
mb|4C|nt|gal: another possibility is that he has four spades which would suit him as well|pg||

mb|2H|nt|ahh: ireland have started like a train|pg||

mb|p|nt|cherilou: 3NT here|pg||
nt|mcphee: and Simon Cope|pg||
nt|kareno: There's an alumnus of the Pakistan team on the U.S. team now.  Zia is one of the most famous bridge players in the world!|pg||
nt|nils123: he did nice passing... i wouldnt for sure!|pg||
nt|inquiry: hmmmm|pg||
nt|inquiry: I wonder if their 1NT denies two four card majors?|pg||
nt|stewball: so 2 earned imps to the dutch against the 6@d in the open room|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW look to have 3NT here|pg||
nt|brolucius: We saw yesterday that some players double with 4/5 spades and use 1S artificially|pg||
nt|offthebend: 1S ? Looks like it shows D|pg||

nt|mrdct: the dutch have wrong-side NTs now|pg||
nt|udo: he is thinking about 2 @D ?|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@c is Ghestem for the red suits|pg||
nt|stewball: i'm betting 5@hx|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Russians made 4@h in this one|pg||
nt|dburn: for which Fantoni seems to have a pretty good fit|pg||
nt|lrargerich: After nunes showed the red suits they are going to defend in 5@d or 5@h|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mcphee: a "mini" @S call from Gann to stir things up early|pg||
nt|curtis: Together, our contestants have over 25 pages of notes|pg||
nt|copeyj: Does that mean you have been studying Curtis?|pg||
nt|curtis: notice has been served|pg||

pc|cA|nt|cherilou: EW play weak NT NV so this shows 15-17|pg||
nt|nils123: he is more afraid of getting dbl in red than missing a game|pg||
nt|jtr: Good afternoon from Istanbul|pg||
nt|thor17: hi david|pg||
nt|ahh: surprised they did not get to 2@H  that plays ok|pg||
nt|stewball: apparently not|pg||
nt|udo: yes, seems clear , to bid now, always the hand with shortness in opps fit should bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: If so South will bid 2@H|pg||
nt|udo: probably 6-4 majors|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@s is merely competitive - 3@h or 3@d would be used to show a constructve spade raise|pg||
nt|lrargerich: So Jansma thinks he is "saving" ? Maybe....|pg||
nt|offthebend: Restricted choice would have been a child's play on this one|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yeshoney: will they be able to stop in 3nt |pg||
nt|mcphee: gee Curits, the only notes you ever read were the ones you had to take home to Mom from your teachers|pg||
nt|curtis: You will all be quizzed throughout the match|pg||
nt|vugraph196: guray ben... cengiz gitti|pg||
nt|copeyj: hehe|pg||
nt|nils123: hi there, looks like u can hold the champagne ready|pg||
nt|murad: or 2@D if defense cash out winners|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|gcohler: arnolds is not the timid one!|pg||
nt|jtr: re Russ No agreeing today please The specs prefer controversy:-)|pg||
nt|thor17: probably 1D-1N overcall-X: Not clear to move with N|pg||
nt|nils123: i bet they end up with more trikc defending 1nt than playing it themselves|pg||
nt|thor17: trying to spice it up|pg||
nt|jtr: Not quite finished the chicken counting yet:-)|pg||
nt|ahh: north is really garvey not garnev  no bulgarian  ringer playing|pg||
nt|ritong: second chance|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think on a @H in 3NT you can duck a few times and then squeeze south perhaps?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jbgood: weak nt only in white against red|pg||
nt|eggy: that's a pretty hefty 3@S especially in Hackett style|pg||
nt|kareno: Good double by south.|pg||
nt|murad: makeable on non-heart lead|pg||
nt|murad: especially on club lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: If it is 12-14, I don't think North is worth a forward move. |pg||
nt|murad: club lead gives a trick and tempo|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|inquiry: russia did pick up one imp on board 1....|pg||
nt|murad: good lead|pg||
nt|udo: easy 8 or 9 tricks ?|pg||
nt|udo: with @S  s especially well placed|pg||
nt|roghog: nice gadget, GD, I'll remember that one|pg||
nt|mrdct: the italians have bid this to 3NT by east in the open room on the @HJ lead|pg||
nt|stewball: Jansma has no way of knowing if this is a make,,,more likely he's expecting a save|pg||
nt|dburn: With @hA right and 3-3 diamonds, this is a slam|pg||
nt|dburn: but that is roughly an 18% chance in the abstract|pg||
nt|dburn: However, after the opening bid, the odds change somewhat (and there are other winning diamond positions for declarer)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Fantoni had holes in every suit, and it is a poor slam anyway (even with heart ace likely to be right)|pg||
nt|ritong: welcome to mark thiele, who wimm bring us some dutch touch|pg||
nt|ritong: will*|pg||
nt|mthiele: hiay all !|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, if the @DJ or @D10 falls from East on the second round, Restricted Choice applies |pg||
nt|dburn: The Dutch in the other room are likely to have a free run, and are not likely to bid a slam|pg||
nt|cascade: this is a Precision 2@c opening|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ahh: so sweden play 1nt in each room |pg||
nt|nils123: 2 down seems alot, no chance to get 6 tricks ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like a swing of at least 3 imps to italy|pg||
nt|brolucius: Right to lead the honour from J-10-x-x, against a suit contract. Make the honours count on the first two rounds.|pg||
nt|cascade: hard to bid 6@s when they do not mention the suit|pg||
nt|szalay: I prefer Precision 2@D, not @C with 4405|pg||
nt|szalay: u cant bid BOTH your majors after 2@C|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: Your commentators for this match are Karen Allison, USA, Steve Eginton, England, and Venkatesh Ramaratnam, India|pg||
nt|thor17: curtis..u go back to bed? :)|pg||
nt|jtr: this is far from making either|pg||
nt|udo: 3 @C make, 2 @S could be in danger|pg||
nt|brolucius: Nice play by East, too|pg||
nt|pyg: As north did not overcalled it became tougher to find slam|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: Welcome guys|pg||
nt|murad: verhees should find the club switch at some point|pg||
nt|szalay: but I with upgrade it to 1@C, anyway|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|cherilou: NS set up for big penalty|pg||
nt|jbgood: 10-12 1st and 2nd pos - 11-15 3rd and 4th pos|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing 3rd/5th leads, East can see five tricks and needs to find a six in one of the black suits |pg||
nt|brolucius: ...but he has guessed wrong|pg||
nt|copeyj: Unfortunate for Verhees, the @S switch allows 2N to make. would it have been worth cashing A@H to try and get some kind if signal from Jansma?|pg||
nt|murad: the defense can still prevail|pg||
nt|offthebend: Very true|pg||
nt|jbgood: Hi Mark|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|nils123: need to play @d|pg||
nt|mthiele: pas by jansma means he is willing to play 5@s|pg||
nt|stewball: he has plenty of losers opposite a competitve 3@s|pg||
nt|dburn: Perhaps Verhees regarded South's pass to 5@d as forcing, and perhaps he was right to do so|pg||
pc|d4|nt|copeyj: This may make, for the loss of 1@D and 1@C|pg||
nt|curtis: well done by Nystrom to raise|pg||
nt|kareno: Zia is from Pakistan and lives in New York City now.  |pg||
nt|eggy: well it gains 50 anyway|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks, Roland.|pg||
nt|rv: tks Roland|pg||
nt|kareno: It's a good, practical double by south, who has enough values to feel he has equity at this level after his partner's original takeout double.|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Karen and Steve|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spades are blocked and East still has a chance to switch to clubs|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cherilou: Ah, that 1 imp revenge|pg||
nt|udo: 4@H,  .... to much for me|pg||
nt|sommer: hi|pg||
nt|jbgood: passing 2 and then bidding game seems a bit undiciplined with south's hand|pg||
nt|ritong: welcome to povl  sommer  ffrom  denmark  hej, povl:)|pg||
nt|udo: wlc povl Sommer from denmark|pg||
nt|sommer: ducking a @S gives chances, I guess|pg||
nt|udo: :))|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi Povl|pg||
nt|sommer: hi:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hold up @Ds until the 3rd round, and then play a @C through|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mcphee: Nystron of course felt hi K@H was a good card|pg||
nt|kareno: Hi, Venky :)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|roghog: another helpful lead|pg||
nt|szalay: upgrade is especcially good move when NV/V|pg||
nt|pyg: bad point for EW auction they did not found their 5/4fit|pg||
pc|h7|nt|copeyj: Hi to our operator in Istanbul also, Afternoon Guray|pg||
nt|vugraph196: thank you... welcome|pg||
nt|mcphee:  196|pg||
nt|curtis: Hi Guray|pg||
nt|jtr: confucius he say both sides play 1NT one side wrong  Here though both sides are wrong|pg||
nt|nils123: lol, true|pg||
nt|udo: the fall of all missing @S.honours gives some chance, indeed|pg||
nt|udo: defenders better open @D early|pg||
nt|sommer: it's cold, and whats better than to play for the fall of KQx of @S|pg||
nt|udo: nothing?:))))|pg||
nt|ritong: playing for KQ onside with the balancer...|pg||
nt|sommer: no:)|pg||
nt|dburn: but, compelled to bid 5@s or double, his actual choice looks rather odd|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Doesn't look like a forcing pass situation to me|pg||
nt|offthebend: Again the result not likely to favor the Dutch -at least I feel|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|nils123: so ireland make 7 and 8 tricks in defence 1nt on same hand|pg||
nt|jtr: needs to switch @d|pg||
nt|ahh: certainly cant complain about lack of action already|pg||
nt|curtis: Sweden better hope the hands turn wild.  In USA-Venenzuela womens yesterday 126 IMPs scored in 16 boards.  63-63 tie|pg||
nt|nils123: y, but with that dummy it should be possible|pg||
nt|stewball: ratio of offence to defense would dictate DBL one would think|pg||
nt|mthiele: when vuln against non-vuln they play forcing pass|pg||
nt|stewball: perhaps the VUL dictated forcing pass|pg||
nt|dburn: He may, with reason, have feared a double fit - East-West with the red suits, North-South with the black suits|pg||
nt|mthiele: but dbl on 5@d looked more straughtforward with the southhand|pg||
nt|offthebend: No way this is a forcing pass situation.|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case, perhaps both sides could make 11 tricks, but I feel that if 5@s was going to make opposite what North had, South would have bid it.|pg||
nt|offthebend: He may not be sure of beating it|pg||
nt|stewball: Jansma has no particular reason to think he can defeat 5@d|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mthiele: it's the consequence of a forcing pass situation, just following the law|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mthiele: let's hope the dutch have a good day today !|pg||
pc|s3|nt|copeyj: Bingo|pg||
nt|curtis: guray is messing with us already|pg||
nt|mcphee: gin as they say|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jtr: possible but.....|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|nils123: hm, can u see a line fo rdown turing a club?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|yeshoney: H lead would make it harder but still makes|pg||
nt|cherilou: S will find it hard to believe no way to the N hand after this auction|pg||
nt|jbgood: :))|pg||
nt|eggy: not so practical now perhaps|pg||
nt|offthebend: Isn't 5D a much better contract which they have managed nicely|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mrdct: true|pg||
nt|brolucius: Fine effort to reach 5D. I wouldn't have fancied 3NT.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cherilou: This is a new partnership, I believe. Perhaps they played together years agp|pg||
nt|ritong: dutch touch, i told you :)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jtr: passive i guess Declarer may need to guess @sJ|pg||
nt|nils123: must be much more chance finding pd with something i @d|pg||
nt|murad: that should do it|pg||
nt|ritong: okay folks  have fun :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mcphee: and nice that Hanhon is not able to get @D wrong|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dburn: They played together for years, years ago :)|pg||
nt|yeshoney: south might try C as the only hope to beat, but north cant have A@C|pg||
nt|ritong: we have a small problem with players names here...|pg||
nt|dburn: Well, the Dutch will certainly hope so - and perhaps so will the neutrals, who would like to see a close match|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|jtr: would have been better if they could organise North to win the fourth heart|pg||
nt|nils123: but u loose tempo, if pd holds Kxx in club?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rv: English may have peaked too early in this tourney, they were undefeated in the entire round robin but have not won a single set in the pre-QFs|pg||
nt|eggy: Good afternoon - Being 33 down, England have brought in some ringers|pg||
nt|mrdct: 9 trick now it seems|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cherilou: EW didn't get to 4@H at other table--maybe NS didn't push them there|pg||
pc|c9|nt|offthebend: How about doubling 3C with N and then reverting to some no. of spades.3S by itself doesn,t say anything opposite a 3rd hand opening|pg||
nt|stewball: to the extent there was misjudgement,it was Verhees in my view|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|nils123: sell, a big gain for ireland anyway|pg||
nt|jtr: you asked me for a line Nils not a justification:-)|pg||
nt|nils123: hehe, true, u did ur best... lol|pg||
nt|ahh: lead now 51|pg||
mc|9|nt|kareno: That round robin result was impressive.|pg||

nt|szalay: Honti is 44, Szilagyi is really old: 48:-)|pg||
nt|panja: NS overevaluated their sracthcy hands in this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|gal: another too good hanf for a weak two|pg||
mb|1C|an|prec|nt|josj: lol|pg||
mb|2C|an|di or majors|nt|panja: if South responds with a positive bid, they will end up in a game here too|pg||
nt|gal: 2C : diamonds or majors|pg||
mb|d|nt|szalay: they r plyaing Rubensohl here|pg||
nt|jtr: West will hazard a guess as to which:-)|pg||
nt|gal: but this hand is GF |pg||
mb|2D|nt|szalay: but DBL is better: possible penalty|pg||
nt|panja: West bids his worst of the three suits after such A OR B bids|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|gal: dbl was art GF and the rest is natural|pg||
nt|panja: South has done well not to bid 2@S first time|pg||
nt|josj: maybe GF but no game on|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|panja: oh, thx szalay, in fact, 2@S would have been the weaker variety|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: @d A would be best|pg||
nt|gal: A of diamonds is a good choice with the SA in hand|pg||
nt|panja: the @DQ OR @DJ lead will be bad for E, A or small will work better|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jtr: No case for anything other than the A really|pg||
nt|panja: but since the Nt came from North hand...............|pg||
nt|szalay: honour is ok as well: 2@D and 3@S for them....but with sure entry A is the suggested card, I agree|pg||
nt|josj: this lead saves an undertrick, but it should still go down|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|jtr: East must be careful with discards|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jtr: needs to throw @ds|pg||

nt|lethal666: Hi All|pg||
nt|fluffy: hi all|pg||
nt|rv: Hi all|pg||
nt|lethal666: Bad luck on the cricket RV|pg||
nt|rv: yes, the manner of the loss hurt a lot-:)|pg||
nt|rv: I feel England still believe they can win this, though need a few IMPs quickly-:)|pg||
nt|jtr: only 1 imp lost  We can soon afford it i hope|pg||
nt|udo: italy made 4@H here , after the lead he placed the spade honours to EAst , and AK clubs to West|pg||
nt|offthebend: Nicely done|pg||
nt|brolucius: +400 beats par, as I see it. Well bid!|pg||
nt|eggy: that's better|pg||
nt|mthiele: well with this vulnarabilty it showes a descent hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: A flat board, as predicted|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraph197: HI ALL|pg||
nt|fluffy: ok we are on finally :)|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Marcin|pg||
nt|fluffy: hey marcin|pg||
nt|lethal666: We resume with Japan leading Egypt 51 to 36, with a lot of exiting bridge to come|pg||
nt|inquiry: NS 1@C is unbalanced 17+ so auction will be differnet on teh two tables.....|pg||
nt|cascade: yes this hand would be much easier after a natural 1@c opening - it falls into a little hole in the Precision system where East cannot make a natural response|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: another comfortable 3NT|pg||
nt|lethal666: hi|pg||
nt|rv: Teramato-Takana play a Std American, 2/1 GF style|pg||
nt|mcphee: we are seeing some wild hands to start|pg||
nt|nils123: so 3s making for ireland, another nice result|pg||
nt|thor17: another solid result for ireland in open|pg||
nt|nils123: 4@h almost make .....|pg||
nt|roghog: 5 card majors|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, with AK in @C's and @SKQ, he would definately|pg||
nt|udo: China made  3 NT , laydown with blocking @C ´s|pg||
nt|eggy: or the team names|pg||
nt|ritong: hello and welcome all :-)  your commentators will be steve eginton and david burn  from england |pg||
nt|dburn: Indeed - I don't quite understand the score|pg||
nt|Vugraph2: We have to restart once again|pg||
nt|mrdct: duboin also draining some mental energy from schollaar in the 4 card ending|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yeshoney: very |pg||
nt|jbgood: closed room result sh be copied here|pg||
nt|eggy: got a whole one on board 1|pg||
nt|mrdct: i would expect 3NT or 5@D to be made int he other room|pg||
nt|eggy: Somethings still wrong with the players names I think|pg||
nt|lrargerich: really strange they didn't save NV vrs V in the open room|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jbgood: 1@d may contain a hand with 4 of a major and 3-3-3 distribution - that is the reason for the odd diamond bid|pg||
nt|fluffy: you can check about convention cards at www.bridgebase.com/istanbul|pg||
nt|lethal666: This double will help e-w if they get to 3nt|pg||
nt|fluffy: nadeem-heshmat also play a 5c major natural system|pg||
nt|kareno: The Hacketts can certainly create some action.. has to be positive action at this point, however, with the helpful lead that Pakistan have.|pg||
nt|roghog: anyone bid on Mac the cat's hand?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2D is 10-13|pg||
nt|cascade: 2NT is unusual showing the lower two unbid suits - @cs and @hs here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gcohler: possible big gain here|pg||
nt|dburn: Well, 1@h doubled is an alternative to 3NT|pg||
nt|cherilou: uh oh could go for 800 in 1@HX|pg||
nt|dburn: and if double promises a super-strong no trump, North might well pass it|pg||
nt|dburn: although East might then think better of the whole business and run to 2@d|pg||
nt|lethal666: if they now decide to play hearts for 4-1|pg||
nt|nils123: need club lead for defeating|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Not me|pg||
nt|stewball: 4@s making in the other room..so Dutch misjudged both rooms|pg||
nt|dburn: The Italians in the other room were allowed to play a peaceful 4@s, and suddenly have opened up a 30 IMP gap|pg||
nt|mthiele: well verhees probably thought jansma would have 1 diamond, or jansma would have no interrest to go to 5@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: yes North might have done more  |pg||
nt|jtr: 2NT would seem sensible as two-way|pg||
nt|nils123: 3h seems normal now|pg||
nt|thor17: will likely bid 3H|pg||
nt|timb: excellent auction to 6@S on previous board in the open room|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rv: Sameer and Said also play a similar system|pg||
nt|eggy: welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's bid is presumably a typo|pg||
nt|pyg: in open room , North overcalled( same opening) and made so things easier for EW to find @s contract and slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: some play X as support even over @D's but not the case here--feels like it shows GOOD hand|pg||
nt|dburn: But North really had neither the heart length nor the heart pips to take her chances against 1@h|pg||
nt|gcohler: if it indeed showed big hand  then north should have passed|pg||
nt|dburn: Well, Notth might not have diamonds - support doubles to locate 3-3 fits are probably not what Rodwell had in mind when he devised them :)|pg||
nt|cherilou: I'm surprised N didn't, as you can see from prior board she's not timid. Willing to take chances. At this color sometimes a Bonaza|pg||
nt|curtis: The american women played their 2-2 spade fit after a multi auction today|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Maybe a dbl if feeling lucky|pg||
nt|sommer: odd contrackt, tho :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: this will NOT make:)|pg||
nt|ritong: gambler:)|pg||
nt|udo: wrong moment , for this bid, but 4 @H seems quite normal|pg||
nt|stewball: I agree...Khok needs to improve his dummy putting|pg||
nt|udo: flat board|pg||
nt|stewball: 4@h undoubled in the other room....|pg||
nt|timb: an easy 4@H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: and the action is fit for the wild hands|pg||
nt|curtis: Guray......stop that|pg||
nt|mcphee: 196 toying with us again|pg||
nt|copeyj: although 5@H by Nystrom is a bit too wild.... Guray :)))|pg||
nt|rv: @h lead would have worked better here|pg||
nt|bbramley: that should have been scored as making 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: making again?|pg||
nt|mcphee: looks like it|pg||
nt|mcphee: maybe not, some transport problems?|pg||
nt|copeyj: takes an unlikely spade lead to beat it maybe?|pg||
nt|curtis: Berheau knows he has a cheap save and no def to 5H|pg||
nt|murad: probably -2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Game was no certainty for North-South, so looks good for them|pg||
nt|copeyj: Yes transport problems and the 5-1 @D break make 3N awkward for NS|pg||
nt|murad: the outcome will depend on whether or not game (3NT) is bid and made in open room|pg||
nt|brolucius: South already knows North's shape|pg||
nt|offthebend: The self imposed pressure against the mighty !!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|stewball: russians did not open|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, so more likely 8 imps for Holland|pg||
nt|roghog: they have a special defence to phoney 1@c|pg||
nt|bbramley: 1@S = @H or 4@S + 5+m|pg||
nt|reisig: In the open room - East didn't know abt the double fit|pg||
nt|szalay: often pass is the best bid..especially V/NV|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dburn: and I guess South might also have had a 4-1-3-5 shape or the like to double 1@h|pg||
nt|gcohler: seems would bid a spade there i think x denies heart shortnees |pg||
nt|cherilou: If unbalanced seems like 1@S|pg||
nt|gcohler: seems like x says i was going to jump to 2nt but cant now|pg||
nt|dburn: Well, Nunes was credited with only 11 tricks, so at the moment it appears to be 1 IMP to the Netherlands|pg||
nt|ritong: hi bart :)|pg||
nt|dburn: but I expect he really discarded a club, not a heart, on the fourth diamond|pg||
nt|mthiele: it's a better start then yesterday :)|pg||
nt|bbramley: hello, henri and everyone|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi Bart|pg||
nt|brolucius: West may put declarer to a diamond guess here, before the clubs are running|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cherilou: I think that's standard USA expert agreement|pg||
nt|rv: x may help Takana to pick up the @hs|pg||
nt|lethal666: 4h is a resonable contract as well, lets see if e-w took notice of norths actions|pg||
nt|fluffy: @cQ lead and contract may make|pg||
nt|eggy: this is Ok i think|pg||
nt|timb: you can even wander to the five level|pg||
nt|offthebend: I really wonder why people simply can not overcall 2H and get to 4h in 2-sec|pg||
nt|brolucius: Zhuang was good for a raise to 4H and conveyed this with 4D |pg||
nt|mthiele: although the dutch recovered quite well from losing 34 imps on 3 boards|pg||
nt|mthiele: hi|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jtr: did they make it?|pg||
nt|nils123: now peter also can guess spades, has a little clue|pg||
nt|udo: oh, oversaw the X:))))) , i get seldom doubled , so....:))|pg||
nt|mrdct: fantoni-nunes play 5-card majors with sound (14+) one-level openings, 10-13 unbalanced natural openings at the two-level and a 12-14 1NT opening|pg||
nt|brolucius: West looks too strong for 2H. Maybe 3H?|pg||
nt|mrdct: system cards: http://www.bridgebase.com/istanbul/|pg||
nt|murad: 3 NT bid in open room, difficult but makeable|pg||
nt|brolucius: He would not lead a doubleton without a trump|pg||
nt|szalay: will Mrs. D'Ovidio handle it?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|stewball: Rek is in damage control mode..we all know that sick feeling|pg||
nt|brolucius: Of course...|pg||
nt|roghog: short for holographic|pg||
nt|udo: will he make this, even with @H 4-1?|pg||
nt|bbramley: easier guess now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dburn: I think so too - good job there wasn't an American pair North-South :)|pg||
nt|gcohler: unlees it was meant as penalty but then north might have taken a chance in 1 ht opposite a penalty x|pg||
nt|rv: Hacketts play 4 card major aggressive style-:)|pg||
nt|murad: good point by Brother Lucius|pg||
nt|lrargerich: I think Drijver had to bid 4@d over 3@s, suggesting a sacrifice if pd minor is diamonds|pg||
nt|offthebend: This has some defence potential on a S lead|pg||
nt|lrargerich: This is complex|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mcphee: that lead is not going to help|pg||
nt|curtis: The Irish have their Mojo working|pg||
nt|dburn: The Dutch may have played this from the wrong side - West's spade lead would beat the hand, East's would not|pg||
nt|dburn: but a club lead is also OK for the defence|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|yeshoney: 11 tricks making|pg||
nt|ritong: sure:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I call the convention 'typo'. Of course I was fully aware of it.|pg||
nt|offthebend: S would have been better .|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rv: I suppose all of us will x with Nadim's hand though it may prove costly in this case|pg||
nt|mcphee: now @D before trump and he will make|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|copeyj: 5@C-1 in the open room|pg||
nt|kareno: North needs to play on spades I think.  |pg||
nt|timb: yes she will lead @HJ and run it if W plays low|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|jbgood: Dutch overtrick imp|pg||
nt|brolucius: No point in West covering because his partner's @H7 denied an honour|pg||
nt|szalay: r u sure?:-)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|nils123: maybe not, when sees the doubelton in @d|pg||
nt|nils123: now needs to play for south to hold 6-4... not sure he does|pg||
nt|jtr: @c then 4th @d|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|kareno: Now he'll have seven before the defense can get theirs.|pg||
nt|eggy: but with the spade blockage declarer could have got his tricks first|pg||
nt|jtr: for trump promotion|pg||
nt|bbramley: despite bad trump break, defense can do little to harm declarer|pg||
nt|timb: sure now|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lethal666: I'm not sure Aussie X's have infiltrated Egypt yet!|pg||
nt|jkotor: hello|pg||
nt|pyg: going down , |pg||
nt|szalay: no winning line |pg||
pc|h7|nt|curtis: I'll lay 2-1 he gets it|pg||
nt|roghog: this will make for +80, but Mac has 100 honours!|pg||
nt|mthiele: end of defens|pg||
nt|dburn: This is OK - the defence can cash hearts as soon as East wins a diamond|pg||
nt|offthebend: OK, well recovered.DA and 3Heart tricks in the bag now|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rv: Takano has decided to play with apriori percentages|pg||
nt|lethal666: For those unaware of them, Courtney, Burgess & Marsden introduced them|pg||
nt|copeyj: should be another good gain for the Irish|pg||
nt|nils123: has a clue about norht not playing more d for sure|pg||
nt|nils123: if hold xx in spade would have a chance to play d for upppercut|pg||
nt|jtr: well if this is the position he should have.....|pg||
nt|jtr: exactly Nils|pg||
nt|nils123: not easy for norht with qxx to play for uppercut.. |pg||
nt|nils123: if pd dont have j u have blowed ur cover and told him where Q is|pg||
nt|jtr: yes it could just expose the trump position i agree|pg||
nt|nils123: now still chance for a misguess|pg||
nt|ahh: kind of groverner play  does he play north for making poor play or not ?|pg||
nt|offthebend: 3H is mostly played these days as good suit Preempt - 3H otherwise is automatic|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|murad: overcautious defense|pg||
pc|cK|nt|copeyj: 12 Imps?|pg||
nt|mcphee: I bet Hanlon was not too happy to hear 5@H|pg||
nt|udo: escapes -2 now, important trick|pg||
nt|sommer: 3 down and 8 imps|pg||
nt|stewball: its a natural response to dummy have 100 honours in our void|pg||
nt|udo: guess i need coffee:))))|pg||
nt|jbgood: The reason why the Russion in open room passed with the west hand i of course that 4 kings do not count for much in a republic|pg||
nt|ritong: heh|pg||
nt|roghog: typo, holo, what's the difference?|pg||
nt|dburn: Not really. End of declarer.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kareno: 1c, 2h, 2s, 2d.|pg||
nt|eggy: ok - this line the same|pg||
nt|inquiry: NS may get too high after a precision 1@C in the other room|pg||
nt|stewball: better than OK:)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fluffy: if @d wasn´t lead declarer could have succeded stablishing @c7 for @d discard|pg||
nt|curtis: never underestimate your opponent's stupidity|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lethal666: X just shows any hand where you give partner permision to bid, could have no shape|pg||
nt|nils123: sometimes its easier for declaerer to see what opps should have played than the opps to do the play....|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn: Welcome back. The score you now see is, we believe, the correct one :)|pg||
nt|mthiele: correct, wd|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rv: Kurshid Hadi is president of Pakistan bridge federation in addition to being a very good player|pg||
nt|mthiele: allways hard to get a nineth trick in this contract|pg||
nt|stewball: perhaps the @hJ made this easier?|pg||
nt|szalay: North and South weren't same wave about mening of 4@H|pg||
pc|s9|pg||

nt|mcphee: gee, McGann only get long @H|pg||
nt|rv: David what did the team have for breakfast today?-:)|pg||
nt|dburn: Jason doesn't do breakfast.|pg||
nt|stewball: i dont think the opening is auto|pg||
nt|stewball: maybe in a weak NT structure|pg||
nt|sommer: very weak|pg||
nt|ritong: welcome all :)  your commentators will be steve eginton & david burn  from  england, and   jakub  kotorowicz from poland.|pg||
nt|reisig: 33 IMPs in 3 boards!!|pg||
nt|stewball: hey rich,welcome|pg||
nt|lrargerich: timeout!|pg||
nt|szalay: do u agree?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: should be routine game here|pg||
nt|nils123: seems like a normal 4s, if not east pree u out of it|pg||
nt|mthiele: aarrgh !!|pg||
nt|reisig: hi hi :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|curtis: McGann averaging 7@H's per deal|pg||
nt|jtr: yes nice:-)|pg||
nt|stewball: EOK weak:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW may have modified their overcalling structure to counter NS' unusual methods|pg||
nt|dburn: At the other table, North was declarer and East led a spade - and that was that|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: lol|pg||
nt|sommer: 10ish :)|pg||
nt|dburn: The English pair in this room use five-card majors, strong no trump. The Russians use a form of Polish club.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South does not want to bid hearts and have a heart lead against a possible spade contract by West.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rv: @c partial for EW here|pg||
nt|lethal666: 5c would be a good spot to reach, except for the bad trump division|pg||
nt|kareno: A diamond slam will fetch on this board.  (or notrumps for the greedy).|pg||
nt|udo: Other table 2 -1 , so 5 imps italy|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c is natural, limited with clubs and a major or just clubs|pg||
nt|offthebend: Italy on a roll - 3 double digits already in the kitty|pg||
nt|cascade: maybe the strength of 2NT was where they didnt agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|lethal666: but 4c is relativly easy|pg||
nt|copeyj: 6@H a lucky make|pg||
nt|dburn: Gold, on the other hand, eats enough for himself and Jason (and Townsend)|pg||
nt|thor17: A flat board here...best hope for Sweden 5Hx 500|pg||
nt|nils123: 5h is a good save|pg||
nt|brolucius: I stand corrected|pg||
nt|udo: 2@H -1|pg||
nt|roghog: we've seen holo, but it could have been worse. there's also bolo and holo-bolo (thx to Dutch fan)|pg||
mb|1N|an|15-17|nt|rv: Hesh may pass this 1n|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1NT showing 4+@s|pg||
nt|lethal666: yes, hes out of things to bid|pg||
nt|rv: 1n is forcing only from an unpassed hand|pg||
nt|curtis: I think the auction 1H-1S is like roman  1 or 7|pg||
nt|mcphee: very lucky, |pg||
nt|thor17: sorry 800:)|pg||
nt|mthiele: <snif>|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@d is not what Fantoni wanted Nunes to bid|pg||
nt|offthebend: So sorry Mark|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: We've been in worse slams than 6@h, though we've also been in better ones|pg||
nt|mcphee: if they bid this they are indeed carrying 4 leaf clover|pg||
nt|copeyj: You'd want to be in it Bob..... if you needed 40 IMPS in 4 boards in a knockout stage!|pg||
nt|nils123: i guess nystrøm pass hoping for down wiht stiff club|pg||
nt|jtr: no one can bid 5@h though|pg||
nt|mrdct: card are well placed for EW here|pg||
mb|p|nt|gcohler: 6nt from south can make but unlikely to go right|pg||
nt|bbramley: other table made 2@H from the normal side with a @D lead|pg||
nt|mthiele: well maybe we get a few points here :)|pg||
nt|mthiele: we have to stay optimistic :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: I am sure it is a misclick|pg||
nt|mthiele: 2@c opening working really well here for NS|pg||
nt|Zmud99: im sure its not :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: I am sorry - I thought the opening was 1C!!|pg||
nt|mthiele: 2@c opening normally a weakness in this system, but here deadly, perhaps fantoni should have better overcalled 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: Maybe 6NT is a better contract|pg||
nt|gcohler: club leads beats all slams from north|pg||
nt|rv: this contract is likely to go down a trick|pg||
nt|rv: 3@d, 2@h and 2@cs for defense|pg||
nt|jtr: except South maybe|pg||
nt|nils123: true :) hehe|pg||
nt|ahh: just what ireland need 12 flat boards|pg||
nt|dburn: 1NT is 15-17, and North has chosen not to super-accept a transfer to spades|pg||
nt|murad: still valid point tho|pg||
nt|murad: EW have not yet discovered spades|pg||
nt|cascade: certainly 3@d then 4@H is a better hand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gcohler: maybe not still can come down to stiff k and kj and endplay |pg||
nt|dburn: Is that right? @cA, nine rounds of majors - what are West's last three cards?|pg||
nt|yeshoney: i dont know why 4@C bid. if anyone does, pls enlighten me|pg||
nt|curtis: A nice club to have in your bag on this one - Forcing Jump rebid|pg||
nt|dburn: wisely, as it transpires, because there is no game in the hand|pg||
nt|eggy: system cards can be found on www.bridgebase.com/istanbul|pg||
nt|udo: 3 SA is good for EW , |pg||
nt|roghog: should have been playing reverse bolo, then |pg||
nt|dburn: 1NT is ostensibly 15-17, but some 14-counts are permitted|pg||
nt|brolucius: Once again, Restricted Choice at work in the heart suit. Declarer will not follow it with the spades bare.|pg||
nt|mthiele: only with solid 5 minor|pg||
nt|bbramley: most 14's as far as I can tell|pg||
nt|dburn: and this, with spades 4-4, is another quiet board|pg||
nt|mthiele: they give extra hcp for that|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dburn: There are some chances for a grand slam, but no straightforward line will work|pg||
nt|sommer: but overtricks here|pg||
nt|jbgood: I would not hesitate to open showing a 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|jbgood: open 1 @d|pg||
nt|jbgood: last brd:)|pg||
nt|sommer: no, nor wd I, but my partner doesn't expect more :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: NT played the right way round.|pg||
nt|offthebend: Again the transfer sequence to get the right side declaration -well done|pg||
nt|vugraph811: dia;|pg||
nt|Zmud99: 2@S show @D..|pg||
nt|dburn: Well, the convention card says (14)15-17, so they only open 14 counts if they have brackets around them|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mcphee: this is trouble now|pg||
nt|kareno: 3nt was dogging it, I think, with a fine hand including the diamond king.  |pg||
nt|rv: atleast a quant action from Shoair?|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1@Hx may go for 500|pg||
nt|udo: 2 SA now or pass ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: i dont think pass is an option|pg||
nt|dburn: That would not have played especially well either.|pg||
nt|bbramley: right play in @Ds is king first, in case 5-0|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|gcohler: in fact dbl might have given it away|pg||
nt|mcphee: 5@S might just fail|pg||
nt|curtis: stop in 5 if RKC.  no problem|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes 5@H safe|pg||
nt|copeyj: or even 5@S|pg||
nt|dburn: However, 3NT is cold :)|pg||
nt|curtis: The clock keeps ticking down on the Swedes|pg||
nt|szalay: these  kinda boards are 'leaders dream'|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mcphee: trump lead ?|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Quite boring 3NT this one|pg||
nt|jbgood: hehe|pg||
nt|mrdct: it's often a good idea to get the overcaller to be on lead|pg||
nt|mthiele: :)|pg||
nt|cascade: 3NT is brave here with a stiff heart|pg||
nt|pyg: my opnion is that 3@h by South would have been better: her 4@h bid needed one card more or 5 cards @h|pg||
pc|h4|nt|curtis: but 5S is not|pg||
nt|inquiry: seems a flat hand|pg||
nt|roghog: time for a cup of tea! |pg||
pc|hK|nt|kareno: This could be the kind of big swing England needs at this moment.|pg||
nt|udo: agree povl:)|pg||
nt|ritong: interesting shot by khok|pg||
nt|udo: for interested specs, Italy leeds 15:0 vs. China so far|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, impressive that they stopped in 4@D after that start. 5@D would have been doubled.|pg||
nt|murad: there are 4 obvious losers|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|nils123: yep, but have seen these boys in action before... 10 imp a board is no problem|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|curtis: still fine , scuse me|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Maybe 2NT is artificial over 2@c for them|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jbgood: problem is that you need the @c ace to take nine major tricks when hearts do nat brake - so I agree on south being declarer - then 6 makes|pg||
nt|dburn: However, you can't actually run the majors without taking out North's club entry, so that...|pg||
nt|copeyj: trump lead... pull trumps and play AK @Ds and then a club to table?|pg||
nt|mcphee: well|pg||
nt|bbramley: when opponents' high cards are marked you can be even more aggressive than usual|pg||
nt|mrdct: identical auction in the open room|pg||
nt|brolucius: Except when an opponent has indicated a long suit and will have the entries with it.|pg||
nt|szalay: disagree: 3@H is natural, so quite often u can find yourself in 4-2 supermoysian game|pg||
pc|h7|nt|cherilou: There card doesn't suggest anything other than a splinter with @H support for 4@C|pg||
nt|dburn: Now, however...|pg||
nt|jbgood: not easy to find the winning line |pg||
nt|dburn: Most unusual hand - North has, in effect, a two-way finesse against an ace :)|pg||
nt|yeshoney: still a guess to make|pg||
nt|gcohler: club lead was right cant get to hand to pull tump |pg||
nt|jbgood: easy only for us who see all the cards:)|pg||
nt|rv: playing sayc helps in this deal, 2@c by Takano would have helped Japs to reach @c partial|pg||
nt|vugraph197: there is the situation , false renonse was played by nadim|pg||
nt|sommer: depends on agrrements, and many players today open very light by agreement|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lethal666: ?|pg||
nt|mcphee: might have had that entry dislodged|pg||
nt|mthiele: down 3 probably|pg||
pc|s4|nt|dburn: If East has the ace of diamonds, you simply lead to the king - if West has it, you play for the squeeze|pg||
nt|dburn: It could be. But if they overstretch to the seven level, declarer will have to guess very well...|pg||
nt|kareno: I'd temporize with 3@d by south after 3@c|pg||
nt|rv: what would the panel bid on 3@c? |pg||
nt|dburn: You might bid a natural 4NT, I guess|pg||
nt|kareno: Or, as I said, 3@d temporizing.|pg||
nt|ritong: "pls cash ur @h & lead for me, dude"..|pg||
nt|reisig: 1NT  (NS) other room|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fluffy: renonse= revoke I think|pg||
nt|vugraph197: he played 2h instead of qc|pg||
nt|fluffy: but he discovered in time|pg||
nt|lethal666: oh was it established?|pg||
nt|offthebend: 2NT can really go for a full toss-no stoppers and no tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: Most of Jansma's 14 counts have brackets around them, though. Some of Verhees's may not|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rv: yes quantitative 4n came to my bid, 3@d could give more room|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't know why Nunes didn't cover @s8|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lethal666: ok np|pg||
nt|curtis: kind of double dummy, isn't it Simon?|pg||
nt|mcphee: but now all is sweet|pg||
nt|lrargerich: That's so english :-)|pg||
nt|offthebend: No , he could not have bid 2NT on Qx|pg||
nt|dburn: and, since England attempted one, Russia will pick up five or six IMPs here|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jbgood: but why not lead your prd's suit?|pg||
nt|eggy: You can see S wanted to protect his KJs, but I agree with Karen 3N could be much worse|pg||
nt|stewball: this line looks to guarantee 7th trick |pg||
nt|ritong: nice play|pg||
nt|udo: yes, very nice, even 8 now possible in the end|pg||
nt|murad: should play on hearts now after discovering the trump break|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahh: some will be in out column too|pg||
nt|nils123: anyone know who meets who next round?|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|gcohler: club lead breaks up the squeeze|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, and he still has chances for the 8th trick|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: Amazing that an 18-call auction should be identical. |pg||
nt|mrdct: south wont have fun finding discards as EW cash the minor suit winners|pg||
pc|cT|nt|dburn: One thing is for certain - if this makes, Jill Meyers won't bother doubling any more cue bids for a while|pg||
nt|rv: penalty card, but no revoke is it?|pg||
nt|roghog: what would you have, then, Luis?|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Coke :-)|pg||
nt|sommer: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: gambling some, @s AK & @s|pg||
nt|ritong: + right @d guess|pg||
nt|sommer: 3 times @S and a good guess gives 9!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fluffy: anyway playing sayc... shouldn´t you bid 1@h-1@s?|pg||
nt|eggy: I think 3@D is easily best|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|lethal666: just pc|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Too early for tea here|pg||
nt|roghog: the bubbles have a strange effect on me...|pg||
nt|lrargerich: I won't ask|pg||
pc|sK|nt|thor17: true..nothing good has happened for them...but I'm sure they don't know how bad it is|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sommer: hehe|pg||
nt|stewball: an imp hangs in the balance|pg||
nt|cascade: too many nice things on this hand for declarer|pg||
pc|d5|nt|offthebend: Polish play 3S as desire to play 3N - must be a similar approach|pg||
nt|mrdct: i've been playing transfer responses in competion for a little while now and they do work quite well|pg||

nt|lethal666: I would think so, then 1nt, 2c|pg||
nt|kareno: 3N allows partner to pass and you know you are in slam zone with the jump-shift.|pg||
nt|pyg: yes no bad news|pg||
nt|cascade: the defense had no chance against this distribution|pg||
nt|cascade: would anyone have bid differently over 3@s with Chemla's cards|pg||
nt|szalay: no|pg||

nt|lethal666: 2s, 3c|pg||
nt|fluffy: actually the ssytem was gonna let them find @c fit if Teramoto didn´t pass 1NT.... 1@h-1NT-2@c (best minor)-3@c|pg||

nt|copeyj: What has happened? McGann only has doubleton @H|pg||
nt|mcphee: no doubt Mcgann is wondering where his @H went|pg||
nt|dburn: And thirteen difficult ones. Still, as you say, a chance for England|pg||
nt|rv: and all the results from http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Istanbul.04/Results.htm|pg||
nt|curtis: Fedin-Lindkvist were my Nationals team for 2 years, so I can vouch for their scoring potential|pg||
nt|jtr: yes Ireland play Holland or Germany  Assuming they win|pg||
nt|jkotor: i should be usefull with "polish @c"|pg||
nt|dburn: Six, in fact, so Russia leads by 35. There are 12 boards remaining in this segment, and a further 32 thereafter.|pg||
nt|mrdct: the netherlands has one of the biggest bridge populations in the world|pg||
nt|pyg: Chemla had very poor @s suit, not enough to bid 4@s|pg||
nt|timb: no - 3NT was right. but then I play the raise of 1NT to 2NT as forcing in standard|pg||
nt|pyg: it was a tough bid, anyway|pg||
nt|szalay: can u find 9th trick for declarer without defence's help:|pg||
nt|szalay: ?|pg||
nt|szalay: this board, of course|pg||
nt|szalay: but defence is difficult: it needs to attack @Ds, not @ss|pg||
nt|timb: 5@C by West is interesting too|pg||
mb|1N|nt|curtis: Simon, If you don't end your comments with "ay?" McPhee might not understand you|pg||
nt|roghog: Dutch fans have particular faith in Bas Drijver|pg||
nt|dburn: and the Netherlands are on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|timb: Duck the spade lead, win the next spade and ruff a spade|pg||
nt|szalay: it can be made with avoidance play, thx to 4-0 trump break|pg||
mb|d|nt|cherilou: No, Jill could play A |pg||
nt|ritong: extremely slammy now|pg||
nt|sommer: so Russia on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|mrdct: hail to the Bas Drijver|pg||
mb|p!|nt|dburn: And then?|pg||
nt|rv: I expect this match to be close till the end between 2 evenly matched teams-:)|pg||
nt|lethal666: They recieved the Qc ;ead, so they didnt need the hearts to take 6 tricks|pg||
nt|copeyj: Ah the Canadian ay, AY?|pg||
nt|mcphee: you got it|pg||
nt|curtis: Well done, ay?|pg||
nt|copeyj: Lived in Montreal for 6 months, came back adding EY myself....|pg||
nt|offthebend: Can not write off Chinese these days in any field - a very committed and desciplined and determined lot|pg||
nt|dburn: The semi-finals in the Open and Women's series will end tonight, but the losers will play a short match for the bronze medal tomorrow.|pg||
nt|mrdct: (as bart simpson would say)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Here's a friendly hand.  3NT will make with no real chance for a swing.|pg||
nt|udo: grand slam!|pg||
mb|r!|nt|jtr: Well their scoring potential has been Irish so far:-)|pg||
nt|nils123: so again sweeden play 1nt in both rooms|pg||
nt|nils123: strange west ddint try stayman?|pg||
nt|ritong: 13 on top|pg||
nt|eggy: can't understand why they do that David|pg||
nt|offthebend: Cheer up Mark.You are on board|pg||
nt|mthiele: nice southhand|pg||
nt|mthiele: hiha!|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: exit with @D 10 to partners Q|pg||
nt|dburn: A diamond would be ruffed by declarer, setting up the long card in dummy|pg||
nt|fluffy: on the other tble against the previous 4@h, west with @hAKQxxx didn´t wanna plass 1@s by south, that helped to remain east @c suit unncovered, and the @cQ lead let the contract ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: make|pg||
nt|nils123: 2s making if no @h ruff|pg||
nt|curtis: Hoping for an Irish indiscretion|pg||
nt|ahh: @D switch will kill this |pg||
nt|nils123: yes, likely to go down 1, gaining 40 = 1 imp|pg||
nt|jtr: he was facing a 10-12 NT Why should he bid?|pg||
nt|roghog: 5@c OK. need to avoid 3NT|pg||
nt|timb: South is going to be thrilled here to show his "major" suit|pg||
nt|szalay: why not 3@S?|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|sommer: yes, and 7@H is reachable|pg||
nt|ritong: make it no trump|pg||
nt|brolucius: East's pass forcing after strong response|pg||
nt|bbramley: 7-1 split convenient for declarer|pg||
nt|roghog: apparently Bas has been feeling off-colour, but playing excellently|pg||
nt|udo: @D 7:1 will be good news for Duboin :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: very convenient|pg||
nt|mrdct: but not completely unexpected with the @S prempt on his right|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: Declarer had pitched a diamond on the third spade|pg||
nt|yeshoney: they make weaker neg. X's than i do|pg||
nt|cherilou: Wasn't it a 4 card ending|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3N looks like a sensible spot. 9 top tricks available|pg||
nt|curtis: McGann takes the scientific approach.  Same auction Lindkvist-Fredin will have ;)|pg||
nt|mcphee: they play the Irish @C|pg||
nt|sommer: 3@C, reask?|pg||
nt|ritong: one never knows:)|pg||
nt|dburn: Having a 100% record of losing bronze medal playoffs in Olympiads, neither can I :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Did Gromov not see his God-given AK combination?|pg||
nt|murad: :-)))|pg||
nt|murad: should make now|pg||
nt|copeyj: Look on the positive side David. The @H lead is cutting down ruffing values. :)|pg||
nt|mthiele: i hope it was a greek gift of the dutchies|pg||
nt|stewball: mark are there any canape tendencies with this pair?|pg||
nt|lrargerich: only when they are hungry|pg||
nt|mthiele: only in a 1@d opening, opener may have 4@d 5@c|pg||
nt|reisig: LUIS!|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: weak is an understatement|pg||
nt|lethal666: Yes both countrys contain 5 letters|pg||
nt|rv: even 4@h and 4@s will make, though inferior contracts|pg||
nt|nils123: most people like to play 4-4 fit major instead on 1nt? |pg||
nt|nils123: dont u bid stayman with both majors any strenght?|pg||
nt|jtr: and 2@d in a 3-2 fit otherwise?:-)|pg||
nt|nils123: no, 2h after 2d who weak both majors, std isnt it?|pg||
nt|thor17: sometimes weak NT preempts the offense as well as the defense|pg||
nt|curtis: I would throw in my two cents, but I'm having too much fun listening|pg||
nt|ahh: :)|pg||
nt|jtr: well he has enough to suggest 1NT might be ok hasn't he?|pg||
nt|jtr: chacun a son gout Nils:-)|pg||
nt|ahh: this style of play make sure no hand is ever thrown in|pg||
nt|nils123: im a simple man, always try for 2M :)|pg||
nt|murad: losing 2@C, 1@D and 2@H|pg||
nt|dburn: We suspect that the Netherlands have been credited with an IMP that does not belong to them|pg||
nt|szalay: Hamman-rule was broken|pg||
mb|d|nt|gcohler: 5|pg||
nt|yeshoney: 1nt is a comfortable spot were 3nt has a chance|pg||
nt|rv: 2@s showed limit raise or better in @h|pg||
nt|mcphee: similar to Polish @C|pg||
nt|inquiry: 5@C seems best..... I wonder if 2NT is artificial force here, can't be natural... with so much value.....|pg||
nt|sommer: no diff in imps, so 7@H is most likely|pg||
nt|ritong: some difference in danger, tho|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c was forcing for one round (it would have been forcing to game without the overcall)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer may play for K-x of hearts with E (not knowing he is safe anyway)|pg||
nt|udo: agree, seems the line that makes with @D 6-2|pg||
nt|reisig: maybe - they should have bid 4@d??|pg||
nt|udo: hm, West hopes to beat 3 SA |pg||
nt|roghog: the holo 3@h is a sort of Multi, ie. he is showing @h or @s (thx to spec)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not attractive to sacrifice when you have singleton in partner's main suit|pg||
nt|offthebend: 6D makes if they bid it.Even 6C is OK on umpteen finesses and breaks|pg||
nt|mthiele: ssshht!|pg||
nt|dburn: so the score after four boards in this segment is 1-1, and the Italians lead by 38|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c was clubs, 9-13 or so|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: ruffs occur|pg||
nt|offthebend: my hats off to them - not one known big name among them as yet but they will be there|pg||
nt|timb: and i think he's down one|pg||
mb|p|nt|yeshoney: where|pg||
nt|eggy: well it's a poor contract on a @D lead although making|pg||
nt|brolucius: Why do you think West bid just @S3, David?|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't know. It does seem odd.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|cherilou: If S had passed over 1@D wouldn't you bid 1@H|pg||
nt|fluffy: defence needs a @c ruff to defeat this contract|pg||
nt|kareno: Correct|pg||
nt|nils123: so maybe 1nt makes anyway|pg||
nt|bbramley: agree, 4@S seems normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|lethal666: it is cold now|pg||
nt|rv: NS make a @d partial so EW can afford to go 1 down|pg||
nt|rv: if Takano bids only 2@h (my choice), I suppose Nadim will x and NS will find their @d fit|pg||
nt|eggy: I'm not sure that it's bound to be bid either|pg||
nt|roghog: 3@d = advance cue bid. will now support @c|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Khoklov thinking...|pg||
nt|inquiry: 4@C will be a slam try... I wonder if it is minorwood.. that will keep thme out of 6@Cs... if so....|pg||
nt|Zmud99: he try to look at my screen...i go back..|pg||
nt|roghog: yes. 4NT Blackwood not so helpful if your suit is @c|pg||
nt|lrargerich: he what??|pg||
nt|sommer: sure|pg||
nt|mrdct: good lead|pg||
nt|timb: As Keith McNeil,  the former director of Australian Bridge's bidding forum, used to say "There's blood on the floor"|pg||
nt|brolucius: Chinese had a big contract their way, so will need a bg penalty|pg||
nt|jkotor: declarer not happy to see the dummy here|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: I'm not sure that 4@h and 4@s actually are inferior to 3NT|pg||
nt|kareno: Vulnerable, it's likely that game will be bid.|pg||
nt|dburn: but it's not automatic to get these cards to any game, though it's likely|pg||
nt|kareno: The percentages favor even a poorish game and it's hard to judge which cards will be useful.|pg||
nt|rv: Today's schedule in the open event consists of last 2 rounds of pre-QFs and then the winners will play the 1st out of 6 rounds of QFs|pg||
nt|kareno: The defense gets off to its best lead.|pg||
nt|timb: South can discard a heart, preventing you enjoying @HK|pg||
nt|cascade: redouble was enterprising |pg||
nt|timb: DF agrees - lead a spade or a high diamond|pg||
nt|szalay: 1 off: if declarer try to ruff a @S: South MUST pitch a @D|pg||
mb|d|nt|thor17: better get diamond going right now|pg||
nt|szalay: if he ruffs @D early: easy 1 off|pg||
nt|szalay: declarer is 1trick short, 1 way or another|pg||
nt|timb: do we know what they are playing in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: loss of tempo but still is ok for def|pg||
nt|mrdct: could be good save againts EW's 7NT?|pg||
nt|offthebend: Let's work out the no. on perfect defence|pg||
nt|timb: It wins 3 against a grand slam, I'm told|pg||
nt|timb: play two low hearts from table!|pg||
nt|timb: and go down five|pg||
nt|mrdct: so is -5 the prediction?|pg||
nt|mrdct: seems about right|pg||
mb|p|nt|thor17: must play diamond|pg||
nt|roghog: wants to see our witty commentary, I expect!|pg||
nt|Zmud99: lol :)|pg||
nt|inquiry: well. 5@C solved all the problems, but I wonder if rekunov promised so litte?|pg||
nt|sommer: sic|pg||
mb|p|nt|curtis: I prefer canadian club|pg||
nt|mcphee: hehe|pg||
nt|mcphee: Carrot Club I am told is the "real" name|pg||
nt|inquiry: lose two aces, quick claim.. (i hope).....|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Maybe 3NT denied the heart ace and spade ace so...|pg||
nt|roghog: another cuppa!|pg||
nt|stewball: well whatever these were they were clearly effective|pg||
nt|stewball: an honourable push|pg||
nt|timb: 5@C in other room redoubled too|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|jbgood: yes|pg||
nt|ahh: now not ok|pg||
nt|nils123: o 180, is 5 imps|pg||
nt|jtr: i think the @s9 should have tipped him off Unlikely play from Q9xx|pg||
nt|ahh: 5imp pickup|pg||
nt|nils123: not enogh, sweeden needs to dbl the stakes|pg||
nt|timb: I'm told it's the same contract in the other room|pg||
nt|dburn: but 3NT has nine top tricks, so this is another chance for Russia.|pg||
nt|bbramley: but 3@S certainly kept them at a comfortable level|pg||
nt|dburn: He may have felt that because he had so much in spades, and so little elsewhere, that a jump would attract more bidding from the opponents|pg||
pc|dA|nt|copeyj: an IMP gain likely for Ireland here, just the 9 made in the open room|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'll take +1400 when non-vul anyday|pg||
nt|jkotor: fast 9 tricks also in nt|pg||
nt|timb: (I'm told)|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|brolucius: He's seen it!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gcohler: yes we all would bid 1ht but dbl over 1 spa with hts and spades is quite risky on bad hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: second that too:)|pg||
nt|inquiry: guess still have to play @Hs before claiming....|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|ahh: do that on every board they win|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|cherilou: but NV|pg||
nt|murad: could be a partscore swing if the Dutch bid and make a @S partial in open|pg||
nt|pyg: other room contract: 5@c dbled redbled|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|lethal666: Takano, either should bid 2s or 3h In my own opinion|pg||
nt|jtr: well the problem is that the irish have been doubling the swedes:-)|pg||
nt|thor17: true..5 imps on every board leaves them 1 imp short :)|pg||
nt|curtis: and passive defense rarely indicated when opps have balance of power|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was not so easy for East-West to catch their opponents. Most pairs would let N-S off the hook.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|copeyj: things have calmed down after the massive exchange at the start|pg||
nt|curtis: Anders Morath's system|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|jkotor: whose mistake?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jbgood: nonvuln undertricks may also be expensive|pg||
nt|inquiry: russia is playing very strongly so far this stanza, and being matched at other table by hungary,,,.... |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|nils123: 51 behind and 11 boards, true 5 in average is enogh|pg||
nt|timb: good card|pg||
nt|offthebend: It is down 5 to gain 3 if the grand is bid|pg||
nt|mrdct: but with players of this standard, it's not unexpected that it turns out to be flat|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|curtis: Original Carrot Club was canape based.  This is some kind of red-headed stepchild or Anders'|pg||
nt|thor17: sorry  5X 12 = 60|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, South knew North did not hold four spades but it was still possible to contest with 2@S|pg||
nt|murad: I doubt the North hand will be opened with !NT in open, South may bid @S|pg||
nt|brolucius: I suppose we will get a game hand eventually|pg||
nt|murad: I am told NS play 2@H in other room|pg||
nt|murad: can someone check pls?|pg||
nt|murad: wrong info EW play 2@H in open|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@H by west|pg||
pc|c8|nt|timb: easy one off now|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mrdct: or not - looking like 7 imps to china|pg||
nt|timb: does Nunes say "Thank you partner"?|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's a privilege to watch play of this standard (even though 1100 and 1400 are not usually regarded as high-class) |pg||
pc|c4|nt|rv: 12 welcome IMPs for England in last board|pg||

nt|ahh: i'm ok with big numbers  13  gives me a problem and spelling too|pg||
nt|jtr: oh dear a flat board sorry non-irish specs:-)|pg||
nt|offthebend: Nunes-Fantoni may feel a bit of pressure now -do you think ?|pg||
nt|jkotor: maybe E should bid 2@s |pg||
nt|brolucius: Spade lead in the other room|pg||
nt|copeyj: looks like we are still waiting for that elusive game board|pg||
nt|brolucius: Russia will have an excuse for not catching up|pg||
nt|brolucius: Since 3@H showed heart or spades, South was fortunate to have both suits stopped.  |pg||
nt|stewball: well that was quick....|pg||
nt|mthiele: 4@h here for NS|pg||
nt|reisig: finally -- a flat hand:)|pg||
nt|bbramley: over 4@S east might have gotten excited|pg||
nt|brolucius: Kibitzers have suggested about 4 possible reasons but I am still in the dark|pg||
nt|dburn: but that couldn't really be right - North was limited and South had passed|pg||
nt|mthiele: with a better hand could have cuebid 3@c, so 4@s looked normal|pg||
nt|bbramley: n/s were unlikely to act, with north limited and south having already passed|pg||
nt|timb: zia made it!|pg||
nt|szalay: I doubt it will 3rd segment of Final is coming...Bazar will be better place for shopping..btw: I didnt go there in 11 days:-( no time|pg||
nt|timb: by winning the spade and playing back a spade. North rose with @SK|pg||
nt|pyg: in open room in 5@c XX, there was a clash in @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|curtis: Swedes always pass with 6 solid over 1N|pg||
nt|thor17: thot only 10 left|pg||
nt|lrargerich: another slam|pg||
nt|roghog: British Lord Yarborough used to bet against hands like Wests|pg||
nt|inquiry: many players might open EAST hand, especially playing a limited opening bid, but their 1D-1yak-2@C promise clubs and not necessarily diamonds|pg||
nt|lrargerich: 6@h from South is the best spot|pg||
nt|sommer: sure, no "rufffear" in the open room neither:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: we may see a nice competitive auction here|pg||
nt|reisig: The ladies are about tied|pg||
nt|dburn: On the other hand, he did have a lot of losers - perhaps he just thought 3@s would be all his side could make if Verhees passed it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: nice to be on lead with this sort of suit against NT|pg||
nt|curtis: might have worked has McGann made club-based invite|pg||
nt|mcphee: not working any more|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, Egmont von Dewitz.|pg||
nt|dburn: East might have (a) opened a strong no trump (b) done something more aggressive than 3@c. But it was not easy.|pg||
nt|stewball: this may depend on how declarerer starts the @hs|pg||
nt|reisig: not after 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: another 1NT contract|pg||
nt|lethal666: I can understand 3h, but 2H should be good definsive values|pg||
nt|fluffy: would you ovrcall 1@s with that?|pg||
nt|mcphee: unless they play it at one level redbled|pg||
nt|eggy: he used to play in brighton when I was in my 20s|pg||
nt|kareno: Of Germany, a fabulous bridge character and fine player.|pg||
nt|dburn: Steve is old enough to remember the Egmont Overture, never mind Egmont von Dewitz :)|pg||
nt|eggy: I think he might have come to stefans as well, but before i was there|pg||
nt|ritong: looks like french style 2@ds|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm sure none of the italians would be worrying at this point - in a few hours perhaps - but not now|pg||
nt|eggy: 3@C doesn't feel like a try, but clearly Nicola wasn't pre-emptive|pg||
nt|jkotor: fact is that 6th @c made needed trick|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@c is the systemic opening with this shape and this range for East-West|pg||
nt|dburn: Neither can our operator, with any luck :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kareno: LOL|pg||
nt|rv: aggressive 2n opening by Justin|pg||
nt|ritong: game forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: but not the answer:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@S is a nice bid to put pressure on the opps|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: or spadecontract|pg||
nt|lethal666: 1S is better the 2s by a long way, at least 1s wont encourage a bad Sacrifice|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, game is all that makes on this hand.|pg||
nt|eggy: I can remember the Earl of egmont from the wars of the Roses!|pg||
nt|rv: 4@h in trouble on @c lead|pg||
nt|curtis: time to recalculate|pg||
nt|nils123: peter almost had a 1@h overcall here :)|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Good hand for the fashionable 1@s response with hearts|pg||
nt|roghog: Mac is famous now. "I held the worst hand at the Olympiad!"|pg||
nt|inquiry: double helps, south can invision @S hook on now if needed......|pg||
nt|ritong: our ditch friends tell me is standard multi|pg||
nt|udo: game in @S and NT should make no trouble|pg||
nt|ritong: dutch*|pg||
nt|ritong: sry|pg||
nt|stewball: well thats true|pg||
nt|mthiele: hearts must be 2-2 in order to be able to ruff 2@s|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|nils123: 22-32 = 11 boards|pg||
nt|lrargerich: they may try to get a big number here|pg||
nt|roghog: 1@h = 7+pts 4+@h|pg||
nt|lrargerich: We should start thinking about 2@cx by East|pg||
nt|reisig: North Passes?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: system trouble for EW here|pg||
nt|dburn: and 2@c is ridiculous. I can't believe Nicola Smith really bid that.|pg||
nt|dburn: North, though, may have overcalled a natural 2@c|pg||
nt|murad: the swing hands are set for the last 8 boards|pg||
nt|mthiele: strange|pg||
nt|dburn: Well, he was happy to defend 2@d with the opponents vulnerable|pg||
nt|lrargerich: They have already played a strange 2@d :-)|pg||
nt|dburn: and game by no means certain for his side - perhaps he hoped Jansma would double 2@d|pg||
nt|offthebend: What's going on. N really wants to defend 2D with such a H fit|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Verhees was thinking "These guys have a problem with their 2@d contracts...."|pg||
mb|2C|nt|curtis: Magnus will review tactics during the break|pg||
nt|dburn: Indeed - and Jason might try for higher things when he finds a heart fit|pg||
nt|thor17: true..with heart 8 he'd have "been there" :)|pg||
nt|bbramley: 2@C=nat, 10-15, 2@S=NF|pg||
nt|dburn: What with the Law of Total Tricks, and "pre-empt to the limit" theory, we are now reduced to sitting here wondering...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...why a guy who thought his side might make 3@s bid only 3@s :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: if you have enough values better to play in 3n, 1 trick less to make |pg||
nt|kareno: True enough.  Looks like they've found hearts.|pg||
nt|dburn: Hard to tell with these Puppet Stayman auctions nowadays|pg||
nt|jkotor: would u?|pg||
nt|murad: should make it unless small dia led|pg||
nt|copeyj: Good news :)|pg||
nt|murad: otherwise east will ruff 3rd dia with good trump|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jbgood: an incredible lead|pg||
nt|lrargerich: 4@h I don't understand|pg||
nt|offthebend: Things seems to be going the chinese way this morning|pg||
nt|bbramley: 5@D!  Dbl!|pg||
nt|udo: to show minimum ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS would seem to be lot happier in @H|pg||
nt|udo: is this minimum for 4 @S ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but I think 3@h shows spades and 3@s shows hearts|pg||
nt|rv: I would have raised 2n to 3n|pg||
nt|ahh: can see why we commentate and dont play :)|pg||
nt|nils123: i used to play these sweedish pair in jrs, have had quite a few fights|pg||
nt|mthiele: ok|pg||
nt|mthiele: this is good news|pg||
nt|dburn: although since double by Verhees would be for penalty, if he really wanted to defend 2@d doubled he could have doubled it himself|pg||
nt|lrargerich: My spies report the Russians are getting imps from the rocks in the ladies match|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Restricted choice NOT working now :-) |pg||
nt|reisig: 4@h in other room too|pg||
nt|offthebend: on this hand, the Dutch can not lose-though they may not gain either|pg||
nt|dburn: It tends not to, when there has been a 1NT opening :)|pg||
nt|stewball: i may have felt restricted from bidding again with Jans garbage|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lethal666: 6C is cold here|pg||
nt|mcphee: tempted to bid the @C game I bet at these colors|pg||
nt|curtis: but more fun to listen to a gang of idiots than sagely wisdom|pg||
nt|ahh: see didnt need to overcall for lead|pg||
nt|mrdct: they sure are 26-1 so far|pg||
nt|offthebend: He is praying for H to behave|pg||
nt|dburn: Not really. You had committed your side to 2@h when you did bid - you can't logically pass out 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: yes, I think that might be only lead to defeat|pg||
nt|jbgood: @s back|pg||
nt|yeshoney: yes|pg||
nt|vugraph196: 1NT alerted as 14-16|pg||
nt|copeyj: if McGann's J@D had been J@S instead, would have been on a (likely failing) finesse|pg||
nt|nils123: rumour has it that italy never dbl cue-bids for leads, because they trust pd always find the lead anyway?|pg||
nt|murad: failing a dia lead, one of dummy's dia will be discarded on the 3rd club|pg||
nt|brolucius: Annoying for Drijver to have partner speak in front of him - just when he was waiting to double...|pg||
nt|timb: Winning @SA and playing it back is a great rubber bridge player's  move|pg||
nt|szalay: Bulgaria survived...3N was better |pg||
mb|3N|nt|fluffy: 650?|pg||
nt|kareno: A club lead is more attractive from the south hand.|pg||
nt|eggy: with the H 4-1 I don't think it matters|pg||
nt|rv: @s or @d lead likely from North|pg||
nt|sommer: I think he now showed 23-24, 3@C asking for 5c!|pg||
nt|ritong: puppet varianta, obviously|pg||
nt|stewball: 3c is likely 5 card stayman|pg||
nt|sommer: yes|pg||
nt|udo: best game reached , 11 tricks with @H-ruff and Club-discard on the @D s|pg||
nt|ritong: called " niemeyer" here, my source tells me|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, udo, no snag apparently for 11 trix|pg||
nt|stewball: is it so clear to ask with Schollaa's?|pg||
nt|bbramley: how about pass to show minimum? ;-)|pg||
nt|udo: perhaps agreed forcing, when game is bid red-white |pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: yes well fitting hands|pg||
nt|lethal666: if played right..win Ah pitch d|pg||
nt|lethal666: play 2 D's, ruff 3rd, then cross ruff, after giving up a spade|pg||
nt|kareno: The hearts in south certainly will get in the way.|pg||
nt|ritong: not my cup of tea|pg||
nt|ritong: tells much with small counterpart|pg||
nt|sommer: it's very flexible using puppet on 2NT's ..p bids 3@D with a 4c MA, 3MA is 5, 3 NT no 4 or 5|pg||
nt|stewball: you could easliy have 9+ NT tricks and 4+ losers|pg||
nt|ritong: knowing a "nonmajored" declarer can be useful defending 3 nt|pg||
nt|dburn: That was why it was OK for Verhees to pass the North cards.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: so the Irish will strike yet again|pg||
nt|udo: i would not like this , but...|pg||
mb|p|nt|murad: 2 rnds of trump and 3 rnds of clubs does it now|pg||
nt|szalay: another "different wavelength" bidding|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lethal666: or just setup spades...but they dont know its 3-3|pg||
nt|rv: many ways to make, @s break as well-:)|pg||
nt|lethal666: yes, but simple cross ruff looks easier, more likely to suceed|pg||
nt|inquiry: well... this will end in 6@H now, and iwth @SK on sides, seems easily makable dispite 4-0 trump split.. |pg||
nt|stewball: take away Dri"s @s 10/9|pg||
nt|ritong: + the john's reason, ofc|pg||
nt|mrdct: and this seem to be a nice stop out fo 4@H|pg||
nt|roghog: Dutch not overawed, I'm pleased to see|pg||
nt|mrdct: perhaps dbl by west is to disuade p from competing to 5@S on an inappropriate hand|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lethal666: play a spade now|pg||
nt|copeyj: 10 IMP pick up?|pg||
nt|dburn: If I could, I would, yes.|pg||
nt|bbramley: i would not play pass forcing, even red-white, espec. after a leap to game|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jbgood: very nice stuff!|pg||
nt|inquiry: and with that lead... even more so|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not automatic to bid Stayman and 1NT may fail at other table (unless NT range forces them to find the spade fit) |pg||
nt|pyg: yes, very well done by Zia Mahmood|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mcphee: looks like it|pg||
nt|offthebend: The other Italians not so much but this pair seems a bit more vulnerable at times|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahh: will be pleased long @H hand has no entry|pg||
nt|jkotor: me not, but its a question of style|pg||
nt|dburn: Russia in the other room did bid game on board 21 (West rather than East making the aggressive move), so the margin is now 42|pg||
nt|bbramley: west has exactly what he advertised with his 4@S bid|pg||
pc|c3|nt|eggy: Shoaib will surely know to switch after the @SK wins|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|Zmud99: small break here..|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the previous board 2@H went down without the helpful trump lead and that was 5 IMPs to Netherlands|pg||
nt|murad: and when we rejoin... the big hands will be waiting|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rv: this contract requires a misdefense to make|pg||
nt|nils123: have been wondering about that, and after spectating versace-lauria a few boards i can see they realy make the leads every time... lol|pg||
nt|jtr: well he has 9 anyway|pg||
nt|udo: only 10 now?|pg||
nt|sommer: yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: a few stray overtricks in 2@S in the other room|pg||
nt|timb: 2S+3 is amazinig|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm sure all of these players are well aware of how much of difference 1 imp can make, so expect the players to be working hard for every conceivable overtrick or undertrick|pg||
pc|s5|nt|curtis: But seriously, why bid over their 1N opener, especially when they're VUL?|pg||
nt|ahh: true|pg||
nt|ahh: only overtrick at stake|pg||
nt|jtr: and W is squeezed without the count|pg||
nt|thor17: Speaking of Italy..they have closed the gap to 12|pg||
nt|nils123: y|pg||
nt|jtr: so will make 10|pg||
nt|ahh: wow  that will be some match|pg||
nt|nils123: west looking for a chance for defeat....|pg||
nt|jtr: if you come quickly Jim it is showing in the viewgraph here:-)|pg||
nt|nils123: he needs to look good... |pg||
nt|udo: i guess the 4 @S is wideranged , so pass should show the " only-@S-type"|pg||
pc|s8|nt|nils123: could make 11 now|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Spade 7 lead would have made this interesting|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|jbgood: that lead was really something!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eggy: I can hear Jason muttering from here :)|pg||
nt|sommer: no grand coup :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: south trying to get a trump coup happening|pg||
nt|szalay: he is a capable declarer, as I've heard:-)|pg||
nt|timb: imgainative player, like Zia, are wonderful to watch - they have a special insight into what their opponents are feeling on a given hand - and find moves to take advantage of it!|pg||
nt|timb: Tim Seres of Australia is the best I have ever seen|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mcphee: I agree Curtis|pg||
nt|kareno: Better shift now.|pg||
nt|dburn: That @c3 ought to tell South what to do|pg||
nt|rv: good play by Justin|pg||
nt|dburn: but psychologically, it's not so easy to play a club rather than a "safe" trump|pg||
nt|dburn: Well, Jason is declarer, so that @cQxx are in dummy|pg||
pc|s3|nt|offthebend: fantoni desperately looking for H10 with P|pg||
nt|stewball: well i'm not sure i agree with any of that:)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kareno: Well done.|pg||
nt|roghog: presumably redbl showed @h support|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|lethal666: looks like the -500 from 5h would have been cheap lol|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rv: I don't think Takano had a x of 5@c, but this vulnerability you always assume opponents are saving|pg||
nt|dburn: Well done Shoaib|pg||
nt|rv: yes much easier to shift after @s finesse loses|pg||
nt|dburn: but Hadi must not play a spade now|pg||
nt|kareno: Now the @c Jack will put paid to the contract.  A spade will be fatal.|pg||
nt|dburn: A diamond will also work, since South still has a trump|pg||
nt|kareno: A diamond will beat it too.|pg||
nt|rv: @s will not go anywhere, @c seems automatic|pg||
nt|ritong: ah  we have another element, which goes along with puppet, btw|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: 2nt 3nt is artif|pg||
nt|dburn: England trailed France by around 40 IMPs with two sets to go, but recovered to win.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mcphee: especially when you are going to be on lead|pg||
nt|roghog: EW play most high level dbls as "wishing to compete" in bounced auctions. but I'm not sure about this situation|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|eggy: I think that the lead made it easier as well, because Diamonds have no future for tricks|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h9|nt|lethal666: but it could be 800 if spade ruffs come|pg||
nt|dburn: However, it is not the kind of thing of which you want to make a habit.|pg||
nt|lrargerich: In the closed room without the 1NT opening RC may doom 4@h|pg||
nt|mthiele: lets pray for that :)|pg||
nt|lrargerich: They did fall in the Restricted choice trap|pg||
nt|Zmud99: little break here...|pg||
nt|mthiele: so the dutch settled down a bit after the desastrous start|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Thanks to all my spies|pg||
nt|lrargerich: They lead the hQ in the open room! :-)|pg||
nt|lrargerich: And Russia is now 104-101 in the women match|pg||
nt|mthiele: better to play low from a doubleton :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|copeyj: bored of passing? only explanation I can find|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|curtis: I think Nystrom just got tired of defending every stinking hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: this decision cost him 10 imps|pg||
nt|ritong: i definitely do not like this convention|pg||
pc|h6|nt|eggy: if N had led @S South would have been more on the spot|pg||
nt|udo: yes both minors or trsf @C, depends on agreement|pg||
nt|bbramley: but he can't quite do it|pg||
nt|mrdct: indeed - may have been better pitching a @H than a @S|pg||
nt|udo: -1 was possible ?|pg||
nt|roghog: bounced into a phantom save...|pg||
nt|mrdct: the dutch are in 5@H doubled in the other room|pg||
nt|mrdct: we may have a new leader soon|pg||
nt|roghog: good use of the Vul by Maarten S. stopped the oppo getting to @h|pg||
nt|mrdct: versace made the same 4@S bid in the open room, but prooijen bid 5@H straight away|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S looked normal. What was the bidding at the other table?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|copeyj: Ireland are going to be right back on Sweden's tails now. |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fluffy: @s ruff to 5@h means 800|pg||
nt|sommer: scooping @C10 gives still 11|pg||
pc|h7|nt|dburn: A chance for Pakistan, if they reach 3NT|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lethal666: yes|pg||
nt|rv: last brd Gold went down in cold 3n|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
mc|8|nt|ritong: sorry for talking of bidding that much|pg||

nt|mrdct: which versace doubled|pg||
nt|roghog: plenty of investment and sponsorship in Dutch bridge, and they have an elite squad of 5 pairs|pg||
nt|mrdct: it will be tricky for EW to say out of game here|pg||
nt|offthebend: Amazing turn around in the ladies - US going without scoring in this set so far|pg||
nt|mthiele: make 4@s here |pg||
nt|lrargerich: Probably a spade partscore now for EW|pg||
nt|offthebend: Only H lead beats 4S on this one|pg||
nt|mthiele: not even|pg||
nt|stewball: so 10 semi random imps to the Dutch|pg||
nt|offthebend: Not likely to bebid I suppose|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Semi random imps ? Do they count differently ?|pg||
nt|mthiele: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: East-West might have made 3NT with the cards as they are, but it was bid at neither table|pg||
nt|szalay: cause he is Hungarian:-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: when you bid a vulnerable vs non vulnerable game, some partnerships agree they are in a forcing pass situation, and takano didn´t want to play 5@h|pg||
nt|murad: 3NT by North looks like a succesful venture|pg||
nt|dburn: (reasonably enough, since it was a poor contract)|pg||
nt|timb: he is one of the few players it is a total joy to watch - at his peak he never seemed to make a mistake in play or defence|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rv: Teramoto's pass of 5@c was not foring so Takano had no real reason to x|pg||
nt|dburn: No - he played to squeeze East in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|ahh: action here|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2D 10-13 again|pg||
nt|offthebend: To lose 2 imps in a well judged contract is no justice|pg||
nt|jkotor: vs N with a lot of points|pg||
nt|mthiele: 7m here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Six precious boards have slipped away and no inroads made yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|lethal666: np he didnt know what was going on, so decided the oponents didnt know either...Bad judgement there|pg||
nt|rv: but agree with Gonzalo that many partnerships play pass as forcing at this vul|pg||
nt|mcphee: if they avoid slam here it is going to be yet another gain|pg||
nt|copeyj: and if they stay out of the doomed 6@C here, they may make another gain|pg||
nt|kareno: Pretty anti-percentage.|pg||
nt|jbgood: South might have opened 2@c showing 10-16, but took a pessimistic view|pg||
nt|mthiele: so they did go down in 4@h in the other room !!|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|mcphee: 14-16 NT range I beleive|pg||
nt|rv: looks like played for a swing|pg||
nt|udo: a flat 4 @H here ?|pg||
nt|ritong: nice 6/4, tho|pg||
nt|mrdct: another potential phantom save hand|pg||
nt|dburn: but now here is a real slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: 1NT nat or transfer anyone knows?|pg||
nt|rv: Nadim's 1n may be trf to @C here|pg||
nt|nils123: yes, possible imps|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lethal666: allready in -500 teritory here|pg||
nt|eggy: East didn't|pg||
nt|mrdct: who said there was justice in bridge?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 5C good, but difficult to sacrifice at Red.|pg||
nt|offthebend: You said it Dave|pg||
nt|mrdct: need to be careful not to get too high now|pg||
nt|timb: Fantoni will surely bid 5@C but can EW judge to go onto 5@H|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS are playing this in 5@C in the other room|pg||
nt|brolucius: North barely had his double in the first place. He will beat par if he finds the sacrifice. |pg||
nt|mrdct: undoubled|pg||
nt|timb: actually 5@H probaly fails whereas 5@S makes|pg||
nt|dburn: Dhondy was unwilling to risk a five-card suit weak two bid at the vulnerability, but will get another chance|pg||
nt|eggy: looks about 9 tricks each way|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@S will be passed out|pg||
mb|p|nt|yeshoney: hand 5 might mean points to USA because e-w can play 2s|pg||
nt|yeshoney: hand 6|pg||
nt|fluffy: ok, we hav some spects with knowdlegde :), it is transfer|pg||
nt|fluffy: ty Samih|pg||
nt|lethal666: hard to see 1nt as natural|pg||
nt|rv: 3@S by Teramoto here|pg||
nt|mcphee: so possible they will not go the distance|pg||
nt|copeyj: a touch easier to stay out opposite this 14-16 than opposite a strong NT I guess|pg||
nt|dburn: Not at all. He knew clubs were 3-3, and guessed that East rather than West had the queen.|pg||
nt|kareno: Too early to be playing for swings I think.|pg||
nt|curtis: weird pass|pg||
nt|nils123: dont like norths pass over 2@c|pg||
nt|jtr: S needs to protect Not obvious|pg||
nt|ahh: no he is fixed now|pg||
nt|thor17: agree...VERY conservative|pg||
nt|mrdct: big opporunity here for china|pg||
nt|jkotor: double now promises strong hand|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@c is natural, or 12-14 balanced, or various good hands|pg||
nt|jkotor: 1@d was mostly negative|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@d is any 0-7, or some 7-10s with no major|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@H EW in the open room|pg||
nt|pyg: disciplined pass by South , with an atypicall weak2 opening|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lethal666: yes|pg||
nt|mcphee: does this force a cue bid from W now?|pg||
nt|curtis: NS good for game, but going minus|pg||
nt|ritong: pessimistic, i agree|pg||
nt|dburn: and Smith is wondering how many hearts to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Japan back in lead after last 2 brds|pg||
nt|lethal666: problem is they can get 12 tricks here lol|pg||
nt|fluffy: mmm wha tis the exact mening of 3@S, ,when opponents hav ebid 2 suits you normally cue th one you STOP,  not the one you lack of|pg||
nt|lethal666: depends....down under you cue the one u need help in|pg||
nt|nils123: 12 imps to sweeden, closing the gap|pg||
nt|jtr: Wasnt easy for South|pg||
nt|ahh: 12 to sweden |pg||
nt|eggy: Smith probably is reluctant to preempt with so many defensive cards|pg||
nt|jkotor: strong raise 2nt?|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's competitive double is bold, with two useless Q-x combinations and only 9 points|pg||
nt|murad: well, the double is a bit fresh|pg||
mb|3S|nt|brolucius: Brilliant!|pg||
nt|jkotor: another double or not?|pg||
nt|dburn: or perhaps how many no trumps to bid|pg||
nt|murad: the Dutch may claim victory earlier than GWB|pg||
nt|copeyj: this is more exciting David, perhaps not the kind of excitement Russian support wanted to see though|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: i think the ball is really in Hanlons court|pg||
nt|curtis: Forces good guessing|pg||
nt|copeyj: moment of truth here|pg||
nt|mrdct: south choosing to not show his minors at this vul|pg||
nt|brolucius: ... or maybe East will bid 3@H|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Two options now: heart 3 or heart 6 :-)|pg||
nt|dburn: Declarer, though, may take the spade finesse given the opening bid|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Unfortunately  clubs T9xx look like a safe lead|pg||
nt|mthiele: i think verhees will lead agressive @h|pg||
nt|lrargerich: You don't think, you WISH :-)|pg||
nt|offthebend: With short S, N may have made some noise with some values he is marked with unless S has all 18|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: won 1 when 2@s was just made|pg||
nt|cherilou: Could make 3NT here- cards lie favorably|pg||
nt|nils123: he could say his first pass was mismouse, but ..... not winning bridge to stay on the fence on this one|pg||
nt|curtis: It's easy to get TOO conservative with a big lead.  Better to be aggressive since your opposition is going to be|pg||
nt|ritong: awful hand for a lead|pg||
nt|ritong: not time to show count:)|pg||
nt|jkotor: that is a trouble with systems based on some strong hands in 1@c|pg||
nt|mrdct: this is another potential swing for the dutch|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Russia 61:0 projected to go 183-0 at this rate|pg||
nt|mthiele: grr|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: looks liek tanako wasn´t sure of it|pg||
nt|rv: right Gonzalo, you can't cue @c and ask for @S stopper here|pg||
nt|fluffy: will need a @c guess to make the contract I think|pg||
nt|lethal666: south needs Kc for opening|pg||
nt|lethal666: when jD turns up in N|pg||
nt|lethal666: so will go for the drop|pg||
nt|fluffy: 10 HCP with 6 card suit is enough to me :)|pg||
nt|inquiry: 2NT is game force, may have 1 or 2 hearts or BIG FIT... |pg||
nt|inquiry: here big fit....|pg||
nt|roghog: cash your As or they run away...|pg||
nt|offthebend: Chinese will recover the 2 imps on this one somehow|pg||
nt|dburn: 3NT shows 18+balanced in the Polish Club style of Jansma and Verhees|pg||
nt|dburn: and you would have thought 4@s might encourage Jansma to look for a slam in clubs|pg||
nt|mthiele: i think 4NT is a bit lazy from jansma|pg||
nt|bbramley: 4NT is strange. he has a good 5-card suit and lots of controls, should cooperate|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I am surprised by 4NT with all those controls and a decent suit|pg||
nt|dburn: True, he has a high-card minimum (of sorts), but he has controls, playing strength, decent intermediates...|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess we are all a bit surprised|pg||
nt|brolucius: Verhees could hardly have pressed any more|pg||
nt|dburn: Jansma had not actually promised clubs at any point, so that it was not easy for Verhees to show his "support" for that suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: But West could expect some sort of club fit|pg||
pc|sA|nt|copeyj: 12 more for Ireland?|pg||
nt|mcphee: wd Hanlon|pg||
nt|jkotor: after active bidding from opps cannot show precise distribution|pg||
pc|s2|nt|copeyj: well done indeed|pg||
nt|mcphee: we have a new leader!|pg||
nt|eggy: thin one on the @D finesse|pg||
nt|rv: oh oh|pg||
nt|kareno: The queen of @d will be a welcome sight.|pg||
nt|eggy: Odd|pg||
nt|guido99: in chiusa giocano tre con attacco fiori |pg||
nt|mthiele: hahahaha|pg||
nt|lrargerich: I told you clubs looked like a safe lead|pg||
pc|s6|nt|copeyj: This is some start from the Irish team.|pg||
nt|curtis: Fredin-Lindkvist probably relayed a few times and found out they were no worse than a finesse.  The danger of knowing too much|pg||
nt|kareno: Oops.. but not here.. a misguess.. again playing for a swing.|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm surprised at two big swingy plays by England in what I think is still an early position.|pg||
nt|rv: feel England team has lost its shape, indication of how much it is a mind game|pg||
nt|kareno: I wonder the meaning of 2d .. anybody know?|pg||
nt|rv: all these guys were so confident during round robin and played good percentage bridge|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am still trying to think of a polite word to describe the double...|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|rv: yes, but @c lead doesn't know about @DJ|pg||
nt|lethal666: lol, over quick now|pg||
nt|fluffy: @c9 attitude elad solved the problem|pg||
nt|mrdct: need to get the defence right|pg||
nt|brolucius: Superb standard of bidding from both pairs.|pg||
nt|timb: @SAK seem natural followups|pg||
nt|mrdct: as i said before whilst only in their 30s shi-zhuang have played plenty of international bridge over the last 10-15 years are truly top-shelf|pg||
nt|brolucius: King of spades to request a count signal?|pg||
nt|brolucius: He knows anyway, from the bidding, that East has three hearts|pg||
nt|offthebend: Shi is thinking of DA to get his ruffs|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|eggy: I think that they had got a swing in the auction|pg||
nt|roghog: spec is surprised Kh didnt dbl artificial 4@d for lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: no trump problem, 10 trix now|pg||
nt|ritong: working out possible 11th one|pg||
nt|bbramley: even 3@H should be down 1|pg||
nt|mrdct: north can get a ruff now to beat this|pg||
nt|roghog: we see the Bus Driver (as the Dutch juniors call him!) at the wheel |pg||
pc|h3|nt|eggy: who else bids 2@D on this hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The link to the convention cards is  www.bridgebase.com/istanbul|pg||
nt|kareno: I agree, Steve, and I think a normal line of play would be called for - take the 52-48 play for the drop.|pg||
nt|eggy: she will pleased to find @CA doubleton I think|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jtr: Very true Curtis|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahh: maybe the game plan carroll passed at 1 level earlier in similiar situation and did well|pg||
nt|jkotor: Russian pair plays any 17+HCP in 1@c|pg||
nt|dburn: England pushed to another gme on board 22, and Russia pick up another small swing.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gcohler: winning club and exixt club looks best|pg||
nt|mcphee: not like 6@C is hopeless is it?|pg||
nt|copeyj: You got away with "bold" before|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dburn: He wasn't going to lead a heart. But the spade finesse is still possible...|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|fluffy: or @c9 maybe suit preferencec for @s|pg||
nt|offthebend: 3 imps to CHN|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rv: still some work to do, but should make it from hereon|pg||
nt|kareno: And I agree that the swing in the auction should be enough.|pg||
nt|eggy: but they are adding up ominously|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cherilou: Just seems like S will be endplayed|pg||
nt|copeyj: is 6@C cold if the @H finesse is on?|pg||
nt|sommer: small chances for 11? ..|pg||
nt|mrdct: i wonder what Drijver's parents were thinking?|pg||
nt|dburn: ...though not any more|pg||
nt|offthebend: Good try by Jans|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Not after Jansma switched to spades as if it were an easy thing|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gcohler: yes but didnt know that north had ht aceand dummy pitches first|pg||
nt|cherilou: Jill now knows where all the cards are|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|inquiry: I would start 2@C with such a nice @C suit... but this worked ok for them....|pg||
nt|stewball: he would need some help form Khok to make 11|pg||
nt|jbgood: the first significant swing in this set - Italians make a grand slam inquiry after 2NT opening by west|pg||
nt|pyg: this natural @dK lead is a disaster for the defense|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d3|nt|jbgood: will be a swing here - am told that the contract is 3 @c in the other room|pg||
nt|dburn: Well, there will be a swing to USA if Montin plays a black card, to the Netherlands if she plays a red one|pg||
nt|rv: can delcarer recover from here, any chance with some help from defense?|pg||
nt|udo: small club , ruffed, @H-back|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mcphee: it is|pg||
nt|curtis: straight finesse after a diamond lead.  Better than that without one|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|dburn: Jansma will make 13 tricks fairly quickly here, and it will be up to Lauria and Versace|pg||
nt|dburn: but I suspect that they will be able to start with 2NT or a Mexican 2@d, and reach slam easily enough|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@d for them would be 18-19 balanced, I think|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spectator tells me 6@C in other room|pg||
nt|bbramley: if (14) is 1NT then jansma's hand certainly qualified for 2NT|pg||
nt|dburn: and 2NT 20+ - Versace may well upgrade the West hand to that|pg||
nt|brolucius: And another, so it must be true!|pg||
nt|brolucius: That's the problem with playing against the Italians. Even if E-W had bid 6@C here they would not have gained any IMPs.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dburn: and a swing to the tournament director if she doesn't play anything|pg||
nt|eggy: I suppose he knew that S outh was probably genuine Clubs|pg||
nt|inquiry: also kept NS out of the bidding|pg||
nt|inquiry: an interesting treatment, 2NT being big balanced no fit, or monster fit, as here......|pg||
nt|lrargerich: 4@s wasn't a bad defense|pg||
nt|lrargerich: If you misguess everything you can it's 500|pg||
nt|roghog: yes, NS may well try a save in 4@s in the other room|pg||
nt|inquiry: yes.. if EAST bids 2@C, south could doulbe for other two suits... |pg||
nt|lrargerich: I might like a 1@s overcall from North|pg||
nt|lrargerich: light but otherwise bye bye spades if your side have them|pg||
nt|inquiry: but both 1@S overcall and 2@CX at this vul are risky....|pg||
nt|roghog: not willing to take a risk with a good lead|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gcohler: great play|pg||
nt|udo: agree, no defensive error= 10 tricks|pg||
nt|brolucius: 'Bold' was over-polite|pg||
nt|bbramley: or down 2|pg||
pc|h2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|rv: for 12 tricks|pg||
nt|thor17: The adage "The spoils go to the bidders" is well-founded|pg||
nt|nils123: strange not to haunt the vul games.... isnt that what we love with brdige?  though games making...|pg||
nt|ahh: overtrick irrelevant|pg||
nt|jtr: Witness the way the italians compete|pg||
nt|curtis: in that case you should be well spoiled|pg||
nt|thor17: spoiled or soiled :)|pg||
nt|udo: or second overruff|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c4|nt|mrdct: i think to flatten the board|pg||

pc|c5|nt|dburn: Indeed - very well done|pg||
nt|eggy: so may be short in D|pg||

nt|udo: even this was not enough|pg||
pc|d9|nt|copeyj: this is going to be a monster pick up for the Dutch|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|lethal666: but just the 11 on this occasion|pg||

nt|offthebend: when I dbl with E hand , I usually catch partner with 3-5-1-4 or3-5-2-3 distributions and 5-6 count|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|nils123: well, i always bid, maybe thats why im not a player in this event :)|pg||
nt|bbramley: 1@S=14+|pg||
mb|p|nt|lethal666: very conservative|pg||
nt|fluffy: he is finally happy staying low, h3 lacks of 10s and 9s for playing 3NT|pg||
nt|copeyj: at last from the Swedish perspective, a break from defending.|pg||
nt|ritong: merci john :))|pg||
nt|sommer: cu John|pg||
nt|stewball: later folks|pg||
nt|brolucius: Reese did not believe in bidding Stayman on hands like the South one.|pg||
nt|szalay: N-S has 9 tricks in @S, E-W 9-10 in @C|pg||
nt|pyg: declarer has not played previous board on her best, should have made 10 tricks|pg||
mb|2S|nt|murad: not the kind of hand contributing toward redeeming a 61 point shortfall|pg||
nt|brolucius: Everyone else does, of course.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lethal666: not a good time to enter!!!!!|pg||
nt|rv: 2@s asks partner to pass if weak 2 in @s, if partner bids @h, East may bid a slam-:)|pg||
nt|fluffy: no double of 2NT? Heshmat can scape and pass here|pg||
nt|ahh: if def get @H going dec needs to find @S queen|pg||
nt|thor17: 4 imps per board gets it done now|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Down 5NV in 3NT is almost the same as down 2 in 4@h at least 3NT has a chance|pg||
nt|ritong: difficult rebid|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS having a relay auction|pg||
mb|3C|nt|copeyj: 4@S or 3N here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lethal666: yes...he does not want to bid spades here lol|pg||
nt|lethal666: Q H lead|pg||
nt|lethal666: is best|pg||
nt|kareno: So they've gained IMPs on the session so far.|pg||
nt|offthebend: Cards right for 6S if they bid it|pg||
nt|mrdct: i wouldn't want to be in 6@S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rv: Heshmat passed before opps start doubling, he probably knows @S will play better than nt-:)|pg||
nt|lethal666: oh sorry wrong hand|pg||
nt|lethal666: still right suit|pg||
nt|fluffy: still best lead, he knows 2NT is for minors, so prefered to lead his worst suit rather than declarer´s suit|pg||
nt|eggy: 63 in 25 boards is a major ask|pg||
nt|kareno: A very ambitious game by England.|pg||
nt|ritong: choses attack|pg||
nt|jkotor: looks like -1|pg||
nt|dburn: Indeed - the diamond spots are not friendly enough to allow declarer to lead clubs twice fom dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: to say the least-:)|pg||
nt|murad: 2 NT is presumably a relay|pg||
nt|murad: any attempt at a dia slam will be severely dealt with|pg||
nt|brolucius: They are certainly bidding round the (Russian) houses on two 4-4-3-2 hands!|pg||
mb|p|nt|lrargerich: I'm told 3@s was passed out in the open room, I don't believe it|pg||
mb|p|nt|lethal666: yes|pg||
nt|lethal666: and hits gold|pg||
nt|nils123: so needs to find spades now|pg||
nt|jbgood: according to his cc he does not have any rebid:)|pg||
nt|sommer: :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: same contract in the open room|pg||
nt|offthebend: With a few boards left and title on the line, you just may|pg||
pc|h6|nt|curtis: Nystrom may lead out of turn against Bertheau|pg||
nt|mcphee: funny you say that|pg||
nt|ritong: what is 1 nt 4th seat  equal vul, jon?|pg||
nt|ritong: as an opening bid, i mean|pg||

nt|ritong: merci jon:)|pg||
nt|murad: doubinine is considering going through the motions of a swing, not sure how though|pg||
nt|lrargerich: How can you pass 3@s with the East hand ?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roghog: yes. a bit surpised at 4@h|pg||
nt|inquiry: 3@S and a club most likely for down one.... we will see if east shifts to a club at trick two|pg||
nt|timb: players get very tired at the end of events; it can come in waves; one moment you feel fine; the next you can have difficulty counting trumps|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|yeshoney: it all depends on what south plays at trick 6|pg||
nt|fluffy: not the best time to duck @h|pg||
nt|rv: Teramoto-Takano must be playing very lite pre-empts at this vul for Teramoto not to show any life|pg||
nt|lethal666: duck?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jbgood: and looks as Vriend is facing some really un-Vriendly opponents|pg||
nt|dburn: and 2@h = rotten contract, which will not make|pg||
nt|brolucius: He is hoping defenders will play trumps|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahh: ireland found the queen well done republicans|pg||
nt|nils123: kind of sqeeze on south, but dont help much|pg||
nt|jtr: Now North can win 4th@h and has easy @c exit|pg||
nt|curtis: It will be interesting after 4 rounds of clubs.  Will South pitch 2 spades or spade and diamond?|pg||
nt|thor17: huge guess coming...end of momentum if he goes down|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mrdct: i'm also told he has a sister called Mini Drijver - but i'm getting skeptical|pg||
nt|guido99: in chiusa stanno ancora licitando..|pg||
nt|offthebend: I am not so surprised. Where is your safety at 4/5 level ?|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Not surprised ?|pg||
nt|reisig: Where is your safety when Passing?|pg||
nt|lrargerich: If you can't bid a 6-4 hand with 18 over 3@s I open 3@s all the hands|pg||
nt|offthebend: Stretch and bid 4D and hope for the best|pg||
nt|dburn: It wasn't 6-4. But I still wouldn't pass it :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Russia 66-0 now|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Did we just find a terrible hole in the Dutch system ? |pg||
nt|dburn: Some these days play that 4@d over 3@s is "non-leaping Michaels"|pg||
nt|dburn: He is hoping the defenders will revoke, which is what he needs them to do|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mcphee: I actually was declarer once and had an oppenet table their hand as dummy!|pg||
nt|jtr: well he needs to kepp @ds|pg||
nt|nils123: ireland had a very nice set in open room i must say.....|pg||
nt|sommer: strange to duck the @C,|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rv: Hacketts are quite experienced, but clearly panicking here|pg||
nt|dburn: 6 IMPs to England on 23, where North opened 2NT and was allowed to make it|pg||
nt|brolucius: 150-to-1 against|pg||
pc|s5|nt|roghog: happy to get a plus|pg||

nt|roghog: there was a similar hand in the European championship, where 3NT dbld went for a lot...|pg||

nt|rv: Nadim must be still be happy he got away with only 250, if x cards start flying it could have been 4 digits|pg||
nt|rv: a smoke break will help here|pg||
nt|thor17: well done|pg||
nt|jtr: nice idea Jim I will use that in future:-)|pg||
nt|inquiry: one could argue that if south was 4-4 in the majors would bid 4@C, pick a suit, and if partner not have @CAce, it would likley make, so at matchpoint EAST wuld have a harder trick ...|pg||
nt|inquiry: two decision perhpas....|pg||
nt|eggy: sorry - |pg||
nt|jkotor: lesson for all of us|pg||
nt|lrargerich: No matter what you play you can't pass with 18!|pg||
nt|reisig: But only 3 Aces ...Luis :))|pg||
nt|offthebend: I definitely can not double|pg||
nt|dburn: which means that your choices are double and 5@d (or a sporting 3NT)|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Note to Italian coach: tell them to open 3@s every weak hand with 5+ spades|pg||
nt|bbramley: he let north take a ruff in the "short" hand|pg||
nt|dburn: Well, 2@h was a good contract after all. Unfortunately, not for the side that bid it.|pg||
nt|jbgood: Burn's law violated: Always have more trumps than the opps!|pg||
mb|1N|an|11-14|nt|rv: just to cool down|pg||
nt|ahh: at least my opps know where they stand :)|pg||
nt|jtr: what about if you hate them both?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gcohler: time for netherlands to put rally caps on|pg||
nt|nils123: 3nt pretty normal, maybe someone end up in 4s...|pg||
nt|jbgood: are the connectivety problems solved Henri?|pg||
nt|ritong: ....|pg||
nt|ritong: :-))|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: 2@h weak, teramoto has to much for a just 3@c overcall|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm getting estimates between 25.5% and 34%|pg||
nt|timb: it seems they have put a lot of effort into bidding slams where is a good distribution|pg||
nt|mthiele: thx all, something came up, i have to leave, see you soon|pg||
nt|lrargerich: I'm told something bad happened to the USA ladies here, not surprising in this segment|pg||
nt|bbramley: possible slam here, needs club guess and a little more|pg||
mb|d|nt|cherilou: we'll have a quiet 2@S here |pg||
nt|dburn: are rally caps the same sort of thing as red sox?|pg||
nt|dburn: The English pair don't smoke - though they might take it up after this set|pg||
nt|jkotor: you should always give your opponent chance to make a mistake|pg||
nt|offthebend: This is bound to produce some fireworks|pg||
nt|szalay: if East overcalls with major 2suiter case for declarer to find Queen of @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|gcohler: worn by the other team|pg||
nt|dburn: Well, Pasman made 2NT with an overtrick on the previous board, so perhaps they heard you|pg||
nt|curtis: that's a 2-way finesse|pg||
nt|ritong: *praying* here|pg||
mb|p|nt|curtis: the bludgeon again|pg||
nt|kareno: That's recommended.  I always suggest after a board like that, that a trip to the washroom to wash one's face is a good idea.|pg||
nt|ahh: window comes into play :)|pg||
nt|dburn: 1NT is 12-14, some offshape hands possible|pg||
nt|brolucius: Small chance to ruff down @DK for club discard|pg||
nt|szalay: but this bidding and @H lead is ok for Chemla...@S lead is a "greek gift"|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: that's not a pretty hand to bid 2NT with|pg||
nt|copeyj: McGann likes this 1C from his partner.... 3N|pg||
nt|jkotor: 2@d is probably GF relay|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@c is any number of things, and 2@d is an artificial game force|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Verhees should have passed 4@h|pg||
nt|bbramley: actually with 2-2 @Hs and @SKQ onside will not need @C guess|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dburn: West might think it shows the minors|pg||
nt|fluffy: he could have faced a 4@s bid by partner, we saw a similar hand on the champinsip with a couple of pairs not understanding 5@c after 4@s as to play|pg||
nt|mcphee: going to make this?|pg||
nt|kareno: You don't want one bad result to extend itself to several.|pg||

nt|ritong 3: need a sub ? :)|pg||
nt|murad: 4@S has no play|pg||
nt|murad: wlc Henri :-)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Does 4@S show a raise to 2@S?|pg||
nt|offthebend: Jans willing to play in H , what does West do|pg||
nt|offthebend: Bid 5D or Dbl|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Pass or correct can be a two-way weapon when NV vrs VUL|pg||
nt|stewball: sorry was away...looks like i missed some action,,,,,|pg||
nt|offthebend: Partner could be bidding to make.How can N take a chance|pg||
nt|lrargerich: It's a reasonable gamble|pg||
nt|Zmud99: delay is cause by the trail....perhaps it's Fantoni hesitation here...|pg||
nt|offthebend: Fantoni shd pass and be sure of some plus|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Maybe 4NT was better than dbl from Nunes|pg||
nt|stewball: hard to imagine Fantoni taking this out|pg||
nt|dburn: and South is about to embark on a relay sequence|pg||
nt|dburn: After five deals, the Russian ladies maintain a 31 IMP lead over USA in the ladies final|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rv: good pass by Shoair|pg||
nt|kareno: North is a passed hand so game is very unlikely.|pg||
nt|rv: well judged, passed partner, 2@s is only constructive but NF here|pg||
nt|dburn: Verhees should have passed 4@h :)|pg||
nt|dburn: There are 27 boards to play in that match. This one has 56 still to go.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|yeshoney: surprised that it has a natural meaning|pg||
nt|jtr: no windows here|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Some problems in this 4@s contract|pg||
nt|roghog: 4 losers, I'm afraid, Yuri|pg||
nt|lrargerich: 1 diamond, 2 clubs and 1 spade to lose|pg||
nt|inquiry: needs spade king onside....|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Unless they lead a club|pg||
nt|inquiry: or lucky break in clubs and diamonds behaving|pg||
nt|inquiry: you would lead a @H, yes luis?|pg||
nt|lrargerich: I think I'd lead a heart, yes|pg||
nt|inquiry: me too... |pg||
nt|lrargerich: Not a diamond since pd had a cheap 1@d overcall available and passed|pg||
nt|lrargerich: And he is marked with some values|pg||
nt|udo: -1 now ? guess 2@C was the last safe spot|pg||
nt|ritong: 5 losers on the surface|pg||
nt|sommer: he may make 9 endplaying S|pg||
nt|timb: West is unforgiving|pg||
nt|dburn: practising :)|pg||
nt|szalay: no game, no trouble:-)|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|gcohler: chance for some blood here|pg||
nt|dburn: as indeed it very well might|pg||
nt|curtis: safety play clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|rv: no fit and wasted honor in @h|pg||
nt|inquiry: Macskasy three... |pg||
nt|jkotor: i was wondering|pg||
nt|stewball: oops|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jbgood: but taken as both minors ?|pg||
nt|dburn: Not at all clear what has gone on here. Did West think 2NT was minors? or did she think it was natural and 3@d was a transfer?|pg||
nt|yeshoney: or maybe west meant 3d as transfer|pg||
nt|jbgood: 5 losers under water also:)|pg||
nt|jkotor: sorry for misspelling|pg||
nt|dburn: I am not sure what North is doing here, but she had better end up in 6NT rather than 6@s|pg||
nt|jkotor: its a kind of slam bidding that I dont appreciate|pg||
nt|eggy: you've no chance Jakub - in the USA they spell everything differently anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: 6NT is, of course, a horrible contract, but it will make with the fortunate diamond position|pg||
nt|dburn: though declarer has the option of playing instead for a doubleton @sQ, which is rather better odds.|pg||
nt|murad: does anyone know the contract in open?|pg||
nt|ritong: same spot in other room, after a more intricated auction, though|pg||
nt|murad: I am told it is the same contract in the other room|pg||
nt|ritong: declarer knows @s with north|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even if you want to press, I think it is better to make the limit bid accurate and then press on the other hand. Still, what do I know?|pg||
nt|brolucius: I suppose it was unlucky that West's club doubleton was valueless|pg||
nt|bbramley: 72 to go here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Difficult hand to bid. Both the black jacks are worth a bit, as it happens.|pg||
nt|dburn: Sorry - quite right :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rv: feel close choice between 3@C and x|pg||
nt|mcphee: looks like we can shut out the long @S|pg||
nt|ahh: check back sequence|pg||
nt|nils123: dont u bid 2h over 1s when playing strong club?|pg||
nt|jtr: ah someone has suggested that you endplay them in that case:-)|pg||
nt|ahh: in ireland?|pg||
nt|jtr: i am in Istanbul|pg||
nt|ritong: :-))|pg||
nt|sommer: @S now|pg||
nt|brolucius: The overcall was vulnerable, so West had to try again, it seems|pg||
nt|brolucius: East might bid 2@S with king of diamonds in addition|pg||
nt|mrdct: a low @D will present the 9th trick it seems|pg||
nt|timb: I like a high diamond then a shift to @HQ|pg||
nt|offthebend: HQ needs to be at the table soner than later.Still lots of chances|pg||
nt|offthebend: I suppose 2NT is game forcing !!|pg||
nt|brolucius: No point in a low diamond lead because North does not expect South to get in.|pg||
nt|mrdct: even on sub-optimal defence - shi still needs to work out what's going on in @Cs|pg||
nt|Zmud99: still thinking..|pg||
nt|stewball: ok i take it back:)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lethal666: this wil not make!|pg||
nt|rv: prefer 3@c though will go along with x as well|pg||
nt|ahh: towards the bosphorus then|pg||
nt|jtr: at least i was when i last went outside lol|pg||
nt|nils123: club lead give som pressure, but not too much... |pg||
nt|offthebend: As the cards are, he should make it |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ritong: i would not be delighted if part bids again with west's hand, but maybe it is impossible|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS can get a nice x-ruff going here|pg||
nt|brolucius: I will leave (masterly) explanation of relay sequence to David Burn...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jkotor: bidding Blackwood before knowing better distribution and then guessing is horrible|pg||
nt|eggy: the @ST dropping might give NKarpenko hope in that suit as well|pg||
nt|dburn: Diamonds 3-3 with the ace onside is around an 18% chance|pg||
nt|brolucius: East's 1@H was not according to the text books. Perhaps the books are right.|pg||
nt|bbramley: suspect north has shown his exact shape, will get to total controls|pg||
nt|dburn: It is all perfectly simple. South is asking North what he has got, and North is telling him.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Is that on their card?|pg||
nt|bbramley: south will like the shape but still needs north's high cards in the right places|pg||
nt|dburn: No - it says "2@c ask" over 1NT, and that is all|pg||
nt|dburn: It also says that 2@d would be a transfer, but would not necessarily show hearts|pg||
pc|h8|nt|copeyj: yes|pg||
nt|sommer: ..ruff @S @CA and @C|pg||
nt|udo: for interested specs : Italy-china 18:17 in this moment|pg||
nt|brolucius: Whether or not they make it, they did well to play NT rather than (hopeless) spades|pg||
nt|dburn: Dropping @sQ in exactly two rounds works out as about 27%|pg||
nt|eggy: In the other room they will guess right, but get a S ruff|pg||
nt|dburn: but on this opening lead, the picture changes considerably|pg||
nt|eggy: thay are playing 6@D|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Over 2@d a modern treatment is to bid 4@c asking pd to transfer into his suit|pg||
nt|lrargerich: when you can play both 4@h and 4@s|pg||
nt|offthebend: S Q lead might have been better.|pg||
nt|stewball: considerably|pg||
nt|lrargerich: And if you don't have a good hand to get the lead 4@d asking pd to just bid his suit|pg||
nt|stewball: the Dutch made 5@d in the other room|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gcohler: you would think given the way the match has been going that vriend would have taken a shot and x|pg||
nt|udo: after 11 boards|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mcphee: however how they managed to make 5 I'm not sure|pg||
nt|curtis: needed a diamond shift after 2 rounds of spades to have any chance|pg||
nt|copeyj: @D lead Bob?|pg||
nt|murad: despite holding an Ace, three-card support and a doubleton, the west hand has 10 losers|pg||
nt|murad: hardly enough to bid game facing a minimum strong club opener|pg||
nt|mrdct: great card|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dburn: Heather Dhondy has to put in the ten to give the defence any chance|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahh: gives 9th trick|pg||
nt|curtis: just speeds it up|pg||
nt|thor17: 10 tricks..next case?|pg||
nt|jbgood: @h ruff and a diamond|pg||
nt|offthebend: fantoni is teasing us|pg||
nt|offthebend: C do not rate  to be 4-1. HQ is crucial|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Strange play from "Deep Fantoni"|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: At any rate, she has not landed in a totally unplayable spot, but the trump break is not the kindest|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told 3@D shows 4-4 in the reds and 3@C would then have asked for a doubleton. South agreed hearts instead.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes I guess it was|pg||
nt|copeyj: and picking up club suit|pg||
nt|ritong: findable|pg||
nt|brolucius: Worth about 2.3@S, I would say|pg||
nt|murad: very apt observation sir|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|cherilou: S has only 3 tricks facing NV weak 2. X would be super aggressive I think|pg||
nt|dburn: but as it is, declarer can now test both spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|jkotor: another board to prove the theory (of giving opps chance making mistake)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|rv: Takano had a tough choice on 3@c, pass, 4@C, 3@S, 3n are all options|pg||
nt|lethal666: yes, unfortuantly chose the loosing option|pg||
nt|rv: what is panel's choice for Takano on Tera's 3@c?|pg||
nt|roghog: knows he can throw someone in in @d, but does no good|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Heart Ace and try to find West with Qxx of diamonds now?|pg||
nt|inquiry: with WEST one only spades, odds favor him long in diamonds, so I think that will be the play luis....|pg||
nt|dburn: Very wise. Bidding 3@c over 3@d, while economical, has certain other drawbacks.|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's a brilliant effort, anyway. The reward for so many hours of play and practice.|pg||
nt|brolucius: And the Dutch have bid it too. An excellent standard of bidding by everyone.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|mcphee: McGann is happy to make 9|pg||
nt|mcphee: @D shift would have been annoying|pg||
nt|roghog: back in a couple of mins...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|udo: sure -1 now |pg||
pc|d2|nt|offthebend: Italians on the right track|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahh: USA  by 7 last i heard|pg||

nt|jtr: yes please Russ|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|dburn: Indeed, especially since the contract is about to make :)|pg||

nt|ritong: oki|pg||
nt|mrdct: Deep Finesse is also known as Deep Fantoni - as they both always seem to find the right cards|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm told the netherlands are staging a comeback vs. russia. up 36-5 after 7 boards|pg||
nt|mrdct: i must remember to copyright that comment|pg||
nt|offthebend: should be at least 5-imps pick up for squadra Azura|pg||
nt|mrdct: oops - it was netherlands with the big lead already - so made netherlands headed towards a concession|pg||
nt|brolucius: Fantoni is perhaps planning his discards on the spades.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mcphee: whoops|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was relaying the information from a learned kibitzer. Just because YOU don't have the 3@C bid (over 3@D) in your repertoire!|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|jbgood: it is normally good tactics not to do anything desperate when you are down. Usually only makes bad even worse|pg||
nt|cherilou: The best reason of all|pg||
nt|rv: Tarek-Walid actually bid and made 6@d in brd 23|pg||
nt|fluffy: I woukld bid 3@c rather than double, but I think that is a matter of partnership agreement rather than style|pg||
nt|lethal666: I liked the 3c bid, but I think the 3s bid was bad|pg||
nt|rv: Tarek's @h2 made the 12 trick after he cashed all @ds and both opps discarded @h, he guessed right to drop @Ck|pg||
nt|rv: Walid played really well on @h lead|pg||
nt|fluffy: much easier if he kenew @cK was stiff offside, could just have stablished dummy´s 4th @h with @cQ for 2 @s discards :)|pg||
nt|rv: in the end position if Imakura kept a 3 @hs and only 2@s, walid would have conceded a @s and made|pg||
nt|lethal666: yes...but he was preety sure south had kc|pg||
nt|lethal666: and just counted|pg||
nt|fluffy: I must leave for a bit,  be back in a while|pg||
nt|copeyj: was this in the script?|pg||
nt|mrdct: the @H overcall kept NS out of a doomed 4@H|pg||
nt|roghog: While there's a lull, we should thank the WBF, who are kindly allowing us to broadcast live from the 12th World Teams Olympiad|pg||
nt|roghog: For the official WBF site for this event, click on http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Istanbul.04/Istanbul.htm - lots of news and information, as well as bulletins, etc|pg||
nt|roghog: short break for the players?|pg||
nt|timb: no, they should be thanking bridge base for wanting to broadcast|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahh: this is what sweden dont need    flat bds|pg||
nt|curtis: zzzzzzzzzzzzz|pg||
nt|offthebend: Making +620|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mrdct: ok. more misinformation from MrT. the dutch are down 36-5 this session!|pg||
nt|stewball: a breathtaking push:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pyg: four 4 rounds of @h at trick 4 would have a bit squezzed declarer|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|dburn: Now, however, it is about not to make|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dburn: Moreover, declarer can now win the last trick with @d7, earning herself a beer|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c2|nt|lrargerich: This position is known as "no way"|pg||
nt|lrargerich: My friend Szalay needs some swings|pg||
nt|roghog: what did I miss?|pg||
nt|dburn: It's all right, David. I didn't think you were working out what the sequence meant yourself :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C was an alternative to 2@S, the explanation is. Nunes decided to ask for shape rather than for the doubleton.|pg||
nt|dburn: Fantoni can claim now, and van Prooijen (who has received the same opening lead) will be able to do so shortly|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|rv: Hadi has given an extra trick here|pg||
mc|7|nt|gcohler: matter of style upside is more than downside once u get down alot |pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@H is where you want to be, well done by Szabó|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gal: i much prefer szegedi's double to szilagyi's pass|pg||
nt|gal: over 1@s|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jtr: do nearly all Hungarians have a 'z' in their name?:-)|pg||
nt|szalay: the difference is 24 years...Szilagyi's age is DBL of Szegedi's...he compensated it:-)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Szilágyi is another keen BBO member.   syl   is his username|pg||

nt|curtis: we'll lead for them too|pg||
nt|thor17: NEXT!!|pg||
nt|inquiry: we waited for you|pg||
nt|roghog: you're really kind :-)|pg||
nt|inquiry: slam here..... |pg||
nt|roghog: back in time for a nice slam|pg||
nt|inquiry: 6@D, 6@S, 6NT|pg||
nt|inquiry: a pickem|pg||
nt|roghog: they all make. dont know which is technically best|pg||
nt|ritong: 11 trix with repeated trump leads by def, on the surface|pg||
nt|ritong: in @h contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: With East dealer, may not be easy to find heart fit...|pg||
nt|murad: I am told the contract is 4@H in the other room|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@s - 1NT.... ?|pg||
nt|ritong: we know soon|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would be flat in +480 at the local duplicate, I am sure.|pg||
nt|bbramley: declarer did not attempt to ruff out @DKxx, might have been needed with 3-1@H|pg||
nt|pyg: she would have still made discarding @c|pg||
mb|1S|nt|gcohler: point is i think they should look for opportunities to get back in the match|pg||
nt|brolucius: East may not open 1@S. He is trying to find the courage.|pg||
nt|cascade: so was the spade ace wrong at trick one|pg||
mb|d|nt|cherilou: Flat 4@H here--no swing|pg||
nt|dburn: It's the rally caps. I must admit, I have never heard of them, but they seem to be very useful things :)|pg||
nt|rv: !red suit slam for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|lethal666: e-w have 3 slams here|pg||
nt|rv: 6@H much better than 6@d|pg||
nt|granguru: Italy has won 23 uncosted points in last 7 hands|pg||
nt|ritong: :-))|pg||
nt|timb: not in 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: uncontested|pg||
nt|nils123: this should stop berthau for any action.... |pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent defence by Fantoni on that last one.|pg||
nt|murad: :-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: In a round robin, it's not really a question of "getting back in the match"|pg||
nt|nils123: is 1@d an opening bid or weak?|pg||
nt|jtr: E thinking?|pg||
nt|inquiry: EAST opens and west will force to slam, should be fat.... although some imps available if played in minor slam at either table|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yeshoney: i have to leave... bye bye all|pg||
nt|jbgood: the best opportunity in my mind is to let the opps make the mistakes|pg||
nt|gcohler: yes they are very effective when rooting home sport teams no reason they shouldnt work at bridge too!|pg||
nt|lethal666: actually 6c will be defeated|pg||
nt|copeyj: Pint of Guiness laced with a double Tia Maria. Sit back and enjoy.|pg||
nt|rv: which is likely to go down|pg||
nt|eggy: maybe, he'l play @D like Justin|pg||
nt|lrargerich: I think 6@s is the best one|pg||
nt|mrdct: Deep Fantoni|pg||
nt|brolucius: Do I owe you royalties every time I mention the F-word?|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@c is a limited splinter, about 10-13 hcp|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@h is 14+ and forcing|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lethal666: no ill retract that 6c will make 80% of the time|pg||
nt|rv: Takano bid a non forcing 4@h in last round and now choice of slams-:)|pg||
nt|nils123: 2@d i mean|pg||
nt|offthebend: An awful opening bid - one would think |pg||
pc|s2|nt|fluffy: he hs to guess @d to win|pg||
nt|thor17: possible 1 IMP gain for holding to 4|pg||
nt|eggy: well predicted David|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|fluffy: I don´t think double will help on it|pg||
nt|roghog: 2@c art gf|pg||
nt|udo: 4@S rolls home ?|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@s is 0-9 and natural|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is normal to rebid 2@H, rather than 2@C, on a minimum 6-4 hand. Here 14 points is a minimum.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rv: he rightly assumed that no wastage in @s with partner and bid the slam on instincts|pg||
nt|inquiry: I imagine now they are on their way to 6@S|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1@S is either nice tactical bid or shows a @C suit|pg||
nt|offthebend: Might be another 5 to the ITA kitty|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's double was intended to show good diamonds. Maybe East misunderstood. Strange double of 4@H|pg||
nt|timb: OK if W bids 5@C|pg||
nt|mrdct: it's looking that way - unless china find the save in 5@C|pg||
nt|mrdct: which will make sense if @S showed a @C suit|pg||
nt|offthebend: Find the CQ for 500|pg||
nt|mrdct: not all alerts get picked up by the operator as the player may briefly wave his alert card while the operator is doing something else|pg||
nt|lrargerich: 4 controls, quite good|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c would have been a two-way rebid - either natural or any 18+|pg||
nt|dburn: Since it would also have been forcing, Nunes preferred 2@h because he was certain to end up in at least that anyway.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn: The thing is to regard the entire round robin as one 420-board match|pg||
nt|rv: this contract could depend on where he wins the first trick-:)|pg||
nt|kareno: He's more likely to take the normal play in diamonds.  He's looking for no swings.|pg||
nt|offthebend: Interesting lead instead of H10|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Maybe third from T9x  :-)|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Should be down 1 for a push|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: in which there are still 70 boards to go|pg||
nt|gcohler: at the begginning that is true but both teams already in for sur|pg||
nt|cherilou: They usually occur in baseball. One takes theai baseball cap and wears it backward -with the bill facing back. Looks odd, but there's been some great sports comebacks|pg||
nt|fluffy: I fell he will missguss|pg||
nt|fluffy: feel|pg||
nt|roghog: in 6@s you can ruff out @d, if 4-1. but no such problem here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes 1@S showed clubs, as before, but how can West sacrifice on 2-2-5-4 shape at this score?|pg||
nt|mrdct: having done it quite a few times, i can tell you the vugraph operating is not nearly as easy at it looks|pg||
nt|mrdct: i believe so udo|pg||
nt|roghog: unless you ruff a @h|pg||
nt|udo: i guess beatable only with @H - ruff|pg||
nt|timb: i believe bridge base is giving bridge a wonderful filip - and could see our beautiful game return to its gory days of popularity|pg||
nt|timb: glory|pg||
nt|bbramley: i liked the gory days myself|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|copeyj: Is that an opener 1st in hand for you guys?|pg||
nt|ahh: can win an imp with the lead|pg||
nt|jtr: i believe it is constructive|pg||
nt|offthebend: So it 70-68 now|pg||
nt|timb: double seems optimistic - to put it kindly|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rv: now he will guess it right, because he will win in hand and play a low @d|pg||
nt|udo: will have some work , to make that|pg||
nt|sommer: an easy make for one more flat board?|pg||
nt|offthebend: Spade guess for -100 I suppose|pg||
nt|stewball:  a spade guess for -1?|pg||
nt|mthiele: rehi, had some troubles with my internet!|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dburn: Indeed - the Red Sox must have had some high-powered rally caps against the Yankees, for example :)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: :-)|pg||
nt|fluffy: he can cross to dummy, ,even playing @dQ can be right|pg||
nt|rv: if he won the trick in dummy, he might have misguessed-:)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cherilou: how true!|pg||
nt|mcphee: Curtis opens anything after a guiness or 2|pg||
nt|curtis: not me - and N-B on the way to 4H after pass|pg||
nt|copeyj: How about in the pre guiness situation?|pg||
nt|mcphee: never|pg||
nt|copeyj: I agree. I would not dream of opening that hand 1st seat red|pg||
nt|mcphee: you'd want the 10@H more for sure!|pg||
nt|curtis: pre-guiness I always pass and get that first pint a little bit closer|pg||
nt|timb: As long has Fantoni does nothing creative in trumps (like running @H10) this is 5 to Italy|pg||
nt|mrdct: running the @H10 doesn't appear to be the indicate line on this auction|pg||
nt|timb: but as long as he plays @Hs 2-2 later he is ok even then|pg||
nt|brolucius: East could cover from K-J-8-4, couldn't he?|pg||
nt|timb: i was trying to say he was cold unless he had a brain explosion|pg||
nt|brolucius: Jeremy Flint always advocated extra thought on a 'Big Deal', like a doubled vulnerable game|pg||
nt|roghog: i totally agree, Tim. and let's also thank our great specs for all the enjoyment they give to us commentators|pg||
nt|brolucius: It wasn't so easy to reach game. Well done!|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahh: and does|pg||
nt|curtis: 11-15|pg||
nt|granguru: fast cases in court today|pg||
nt|thor17: diamond 3 looked low to me|pg||
nt|nils123: ok|pg||
nt|udo: sure ?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|curtis: My spelling of Guinness gets better after a couple as well|pg||
nt|curtis: russ claims|pg||
nt|lrargerich: Yep that's why 6@s seems to be better than 6@d|pg||
nt|inquiry: also, chances with heart queen on side and squeeze chances as well.. but this contract has no problem (As long as north not have 4@S to the JACK)....|pg||
nt|ritong: auction is quite standard|pg||
nt|sommer: @HAK very well placed tho|pg||
nt|udo: ok, @H are well placed for declarer|pg||
nt|udo: :)|pg||
nt|udo: not much entries to dummy, but should survive|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 entries enough|pg||
nt|ritong: @s ace @s to the queen & @h looks likely|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and @C for double discard, maby?|pg||
nt|udo: italy plays last board of the segment now, 20:17 actually|pg||
nt|ritong: possible, yes|pg||
nt|udo: so, we are slow here ?|pg||
nt|ritong: somewhat|pg||
nt|sommer: not us! ..the smokers:))|pg||
nt|jbgood: blame it on the connectivety:)|pg||
nt|ritong: yeah, always a good plan these days|pg||
nt|ritong: alas..|pg||
nt|roghog: Norby usually finds the leads, though. will he find the entry?|pg||
nt|bbramley: the winning defense should be easy with a suit preference signal|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lethal666: yes the double wont help them this time|pg||
nt|lethal666: oh this will hurt tho|pg||
nt|rv: big swing|pg||
nt|lethal666: yes|pg||
nt|roghog: ...when 6NT may still make|pg||
nt|roghog: specs interested in other matches, especially Dutch. Any news? |pg||
nt|ritong: even a trump does not cut down to 11 now, i guess|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rv: even if he guesses @Ds 11 tricks may be difficult|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|copeyj: this could possibly result in a pick up for Ireland, I think 2@C may make|pg||
nt|mcphee: I'm a poor speller|pg||
nt|granguru: actual Bertheau's hand remembers my rubbers|pg||
nt|curtis: I don't want to know what that means|pg||
nt|ahh: :)|pg||
nt|granguru: bridge rubbers|pg||
nt|nils123: this is no fun for sweeden... they should have seen the running scores... the last boards would be more fun then|pg||
nt|sommer: 7-9-13, it has worked fine till now, so we hope|pg||
nt|timb: easy now|pg||
nt|ritong: cashing the @cs|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|lethal666: who x's on holding the d honours lol|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
nt|curtis: still don't want to know|pg||
nt|timb: making 4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|copeyj: rise with the A@C, play on spades|pg||
nt|eggy: he almost needs to as he has to take a ruff in the short suit|pg||

nt|offthebend: Jans should work out to shift to D after H 10|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lethal666: nadim, must have visited Zia|pg||
pc|h5|nt|copeyj: Bingo|pg||
nt|copeyj: ah.... until the finesse|pg||
nt|mcphee: was the finesse so bad really?|pg||
nt|stewball: 3 imps coming to the dutch|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cascade: yes 10 tricks on a very favourable layout|pg||
pc|h7|nt|offthebend: Not likely to misplay but weird things do happen after 2 weeks of hectic bridge|pg||
nt|ritong: can be alerted by the big @d king|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rv: 1 ruff makes it 10 only|pg||
nt|dburn: Two ruffs. Perhaps the defence should guess diamonds for him.|pg||
nt|dburn: At any rate, East-West have stretched to another thin game here, but with @cQ wrong it won't make|pg||
nt|rv: he may play for non-existent @c break, likely to go down|pg||
nt|bbramley: but south does not know which ace his partner has, until now...|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|sommer: there it was|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s8|nt|cherilou: Looks like she's stripping @C then @H to dummy @S to Q|pg||
pc|d6|nt|brolucius: We have been unlucky with the first 10 boards, but I have a feeling that Board 11 will be very exciting|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mcphee: making 2|pg||
nt|copeyj: I'm not sure... but now it is still making isnt it|pg||
nt|bbramley: west had to get the @CK out of the way to set the contract|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ritong: a mix of our two ideas, finally|pg||
nt|offthebend: well done and a small pick up|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dburn: maybet the @s7|pg||
nt|pyg: no bad news for declarer on this board: 10 tricks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rv: 5@d has made, lead now 75 IMPs|pg||
nt|dburn: He didn't go down. That is why Pakistan's lead is up to 75 IMPs|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cherilou: E should have played 9|pg||
nt|roghog: Dutch winning 185-109, I'm told. China 109-40. Ladies: France 77-26 (poor England!!)|pg||
nt|inquiry: can claim, as can pick up four=one diamonds now....|pg||
nt|inquiry: that will be flat or small pick up for hungary|pg||
nt|roghog: Ladies China 102-69, USA lead Poland 80-74. Open big lead for Italy|pg||
nt|inquiry: although it is hard to imagine palying 6@Ds.... |pg||
nt|roghog: Dutch ladies lead Russia by 7 only|pg||
nt|roghog: two more stanzas after this, so plenty of time for Russian ladies!|pg||
nt|inquiry: well they did paly 6@D in the other room, so a two imp gain for hungary,,,,|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s5|nt|copeyj: Maybe the finesse is the right thing to do.. @Ss rate to be 4-2 i guess|pg||
nt|copeyj: a 5imp gain for ireland|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|jbgood: y - well done by Jansma|pg||
nt|stewball: hi everyone|pg||
nt|mthiele: hi !|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi:)|pg||
nt|bbramley: also good guess(?) by verhees to return a @D rather than a @C|pg||
nt|gamb: fantoni ask for abreak to ...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...find a partner who can make 2@h?|pg||
nt|brolucius: No chinks in the Italian armour so far. Getting back 53 against them will be difficult indeed.|pg||
nt|jbgood: be a long break then|pg||
nt|bbramley: score is correct now, i believe. bd 2 has been fixed.|pg||
nt|dburn: Indeed - the lead gave Nunes some hope, but he just didn't have the horses|pg||
nt|dburn: In the other room Lauria is in 1NT from the East seat|pg||
nt|brolucius: West must have doubled 1@H|pg||
nt|bbramley: probably versace doubled 1@H with west, as I would have|pg||
nt|dburn: Indeed he did|pg||
nt|bbramley: however, less tempting vs. 14+ opener, espec. with passed partner|pg||
nt|dburn: The Russian lead in the women's final has increased to 43 IMPs|pg||
nt|dburn: with half this segment complete|pg||
nt|gamb: nunes offer some sweet to nether team ..! |pg||
nt|dburn: It's about the only thing he has offered them this session|pg||
nt|brolucius: Are you surprised by the Russian women's success, David. Or was it something that was always coming?|pg||
nt|jbgood: the 14-opener may be on 12 or 13 good though|pg||
nt|dburn: I think that they have surpassed their expectations at this tournament, certainly|pg||
nt|mthiele: italians playing pretty flawless sofar|pg||
nt|gamb: they is some drog inside ...|pg||
nt|dburn: They finished in the middle of the table at the recent Europeans in Menton|pg||
nt|gamb: there is|pg||
nt|dburn: but they have beaten Germany, the Netherlands and England to get to this final|pg||
nt|dburn: and those countries have a number of world championships to their name|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps it is a good sign for me that I usually finish in the middle of the field?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: North 4@H -1 on this one in the closed room|pg||
nt|jjsb: the bid is nto that clear here , i think 3@h would be my choice but it migth be a bit conservative |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H would not be an underbid in my opinion|pg||
nt|jjsb: 3@h also even maybe |pg||
nt|jjsb: other table 4@h was the choice |pg||
nt|gal: maybe 3D invitational|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|gal: i guess south rebid 1nt there showing a strong notrump hand|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@h seems about right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Glad I disagree with you David :-)|pg||
nt|jtr: or about wrong as it happens|pg||
nt|jjsb: now problem is to south , probably 3nt |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 3@H is an overbid with 2-1 in partner's suits|pg||
nt|gal: partner bid @d|pg||
nt|jtr: yes it must be a relief for you Roland:-)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So he did|pg||
nt|reisig: Back to the Seniors for you!|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But the suit quality isn't good enough opposite a partner who has very few hearts|pg||
nt|josj: if north thinks NS have a diamond fit, one can understand the jump to 4@H|pg||
nt|josj: in CR|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jjsb: in any case the cotnract is the same |pg||
nt|jtr: but did 1@d show @ds?|pg||
nt|gal: at least 4|pg||
nt|josj: adn so will the result, i guess|pg||
nt|jjsb: and not sure u can realyl avoid to loose 4 tricks in red |pg||
nt|jtr: ok|pg||
nt|jtr: unlucky to catch partner with such poor @ds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another factor is vulnerability. One shouldn't be too keen on pushing for thin games non vulnerable. Too little to gain|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|josj: certainly older players should know that|pg||

nt|jtr: but the @hJ should help him not do it|pg||

nt|jjsb: loosing 2@d and 2@h yes i think so |pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|h2|pg||
