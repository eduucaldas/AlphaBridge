nt|lestergold: before the long tank took place|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:     both sides know very little about the layout|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 4 1 4 4 i think he would have opened 1@D so likely to have 4 1 3 5|pg||

nt|hedyg: he should have done this thinking before playing A@D|pg||

nt|gunnarhall:  I MAY|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: diplomatic answer|pg||
nt|bobholl: depends on my standings :)|pg||
nt|csabi: better at IMPs when you can gain the contract and lose only 4 IMPS|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  but pard should lead a h most of the time anyway|pg||
