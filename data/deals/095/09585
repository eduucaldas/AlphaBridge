nt|jallerton: some case for 2NT to show the values|pg||

nt|Walddk8: It's a 6-loser hand opposite a partner who was asked to bid on a zero count. Surely 4@H is too much|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  danger of going overboard in @d|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|finch: hard to stay out of game here, although 3NT looks for most natural final contract|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   not a bad spot for e/w    -  but the diamond unkind   and a likely spade lead will beat it|pg||

mb|p|nt|finch: personally sitting West I'd have more doubts about club stops|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: but South will probably not have much choice - hearts are going to be the unbid suit, but the singleton @hQ isn't really a candidate|pg||

nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE  LIMERICK ****  N-IRELAND 92, SCOTLAND 91, ENGLAND 79,  CBAI 71, IRELAND 68,  WALES 45  ****|pg||
nt|dburn: though I guess clubs might not be a "bid suit" in this auction - not sure how many of them East has promised|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|dburn: well, West has started bidding them|pg||
nt|finch: East has promised 3@C, although having denied diamond support probably should have 4 now|pg||
nt|finch: looks as if 4@C is a self-cue for diamonds.  Either that, or Gerber.|pg||
nt|dburn: exclusion keycard Gerber for diamonds, one assumes|pg||
nt|thegarve:  3NT off in the other room , I doubt if 5@d will be doubled|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|dburn: five aces|pg||
nt|finch: 3NT went off after a spade lead, spade return, diamond to the jack ducked|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and a void|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|dburn: exclusing @cA, of course|pg||
nt|finch: EW are probably fortunate that everything else is going off |pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: the everything else can only be 3NT   and that might make with a defensive slip up|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: i'm not sure EW have been on the same wavelength here|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|finch: South probably feels the need for slightly better diamonds to double.  It sounds as if the opponents are making slam tries|pg||
nt|dburn: they were doing OK until East raised what she thought were West's clubs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|thegarve:  the 5@c indicates that, but it is not an easy hand to bid|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: yes, that's what i meant|pg||
nt|finch: I think West should pass 3NT.  She's had the chance to show a big hand with diamonds; 3NT must imply no interest in anything higher|pg||
nt|xenya: i totally agree|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe it was East's fault for not passing 2@d, which appeared to be her last chance for a plus score|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d8|nt|finch: I agree the risk is that East has e.g. Kxxx AKx Qx xxxx, but that is a 3@H bid over 3@D|pg||
nt|dburn: although I suppose she could also have passed 3@d|pg||
nt|dburn: or 1@d, come to that|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d3|nt|finch: while we are results-merchanting, East could have not opened a nasty 12-count with 3 jacks|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: That was a good hand for opening as South, otherwise she would have defended an opening 2NT making|pg||

nt|finch: unfortunately that's only 8.  I wonder if there's a ninth somewhere|pg||
nt|jallerton: E has time to switch to @c|pg||
nt|jallerton: but then W might be endplayed|pg||
nt|finch: I think declarer can make it double dummy by playing on spades, but it's natural to attack diamonds|pg||
nt|jallerton: as W's red cards will be stripped|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzpb: W asked|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: or 5@h 4@s|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||
nt|finch: The 'obvious' line is to win the heart in hand and start on diamonds|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: probably @SK then @DQ|pg||
nt|jallerton: no can start with @d and switch to endplay line when @d turn out to be 4-1|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Seems so|pg||
nt|finch: that 9 of clubs is also a good card|pg||
pc|d5|nt|projekt1: Kriftner - Reim play Blue Club - 1 @C 17+, canape openers else, 1 NT 15-17|pg||
nt|projekt1: Jörg Fritsche, NPC of Germany sitting here too|pg||
nt|projekt1: 1@H was relay, 2@S showed 15-16 with 5+@S, 4+@D|pg||
nt|projekt1: club lead kills,  every other allows to make it|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: E has a choice betwwen @Cs and @Hs here -- seems N's 1@H was not natural |pg||
nt|projekt1: 1@H could be 11-12 balanced without @H, so the choice was between @C and @H|pg||
nt|xenya: and she has found it|pg||
nt|xenya: well done|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|finch: East has to duck the first diamond.  Looks very very silly if West has singleton @DK|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|finch: On the second diamond it is tempting to duck to make communications more awkward|pg||
nt|finch: but against that East might be worried she'll never make it|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|finch: with the clubs doubly stopped declarer can also make just by setting up diamonds|pg||
nt|jallerton: @c are not necessarily double stopped.  E could switch to @cJ from AJxx|pg||
nt|jallerton: and restricted choice and lack of @cJ lead might persuade declarer to play for that|pg||
pc|s5|nt|xenya: now the defence should be easy|pg||
pc|s3|nt|finch: declarer now will now worry about losing 2 spades 2 diamonds and a club if she sets up diamonds|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|finch: so may now start on the spade suit, knocking out the K, 10|pg||
pc|h2|nt|finch: ... although possibly not having ducked the first spade|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: cashes @HAK just to avoid any nonsense|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|finch: Jeffrey is confident declarer is going to make via an endplay.  I am worried she's going to try and endplay the wrong hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: East passed originally|pg||
nt|finch: Anyway, she can now go back to setting up diamonds... cash the heart discarding a spade and concede a diamond trick|pg||
nt|finch: the actual spade position looks quite plausible|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s6|pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||
nt|jallerton: Did she need to play for @hJ to drop?|pg||
nt|finch: yes.  But the attitude lead should have given the heart position away.  |pg||
pc|h3|nt|finch: Unless the lead was from 832, but that looks an odd lead|pg||

nt|finch: or it could be invitational with the minors (that's how I play it)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: looks like 4@H  for n/s|pg||
nt|thegarve:  penalty shootout in the FA Cup semi final Man U v Everton, no goals at extra time|pg||
nt|finch: that's what I would call an 'aggressive' 2@D overcall at red|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|finch: EW obviously on the same wavelength, as surely East is close to raising a sound overcall|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|dburn: not completely clear that North-South will get these to game|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|finch: good prediction|pg||
nt|dburn: since South doesn't have to have a sixt heart for 2@h in this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: doesn't North have an invite, if they play sound opening bids?|pg||
nt|ady: stopped short      surely worth 3@H|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Kevin Cautious looking at Axxx @d|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|xenya: still N has a good hand -- the pass is questionable i think|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dburn: well, they may or may not play sound opening bids, and North might have risked a move anyway, but as I say, it wasn't obvious|pg||

nt|dburn: again, declarer has pretty much the same ten top tricks as in 2NT without a spade attack|pg||
nt|finch: in fact I think it makes a load of tricks anyway with no entry to the diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: she can make 10 with all cards in view, not sure about single dummy|pg||
nt|finch: best is to take two hearts before touching clubs, but in practice she might win the heart and play a second club at once|pg||
nt|thegarve:  she will probably assume a@s is with West|pg||
nt|ady: dont think 3NT appeals -  singleton diamond  and opposite a passed hand   10C makes the hand good in no-trumps|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|finch: If West's double denied four spades (as it appears from the auction), she'll get a count of the hand in due course|pg||

nt|jallerton: with the @s layout a @d ruff won't be an issue|pg||
nt|finch: the percentage line in trumps is to play for the 10 onside|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: S: 3@h ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: E: 3@h=4+@h|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|projekt1: friendly @d distribution|pg||
nt|finch: I suggest diamond ruff, heart ruff, diamond ruff, ace of spades|pg||
nt|finch: this is going to go badly if West has KJx of trumps, but otherwise seems fairly safe|pg||
nt|finch: if East has KJx of trumps you may be in trouble anyway|pg||
nt|jallerton: E is the one who will have @sKJx if anybody|pg||
nt|finch: or maybe queen of spades from hand now, followed by startig the cross-ruff|pg||
nt|jallerton: well could pitch a @d on @hA and play the @c for 3 tricks|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|s5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|finch: indeed, although after the @C9 switch I'd be pessimistic about my chances of playing the clubs for three tricks|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3-3 break?|pg||
nt|finch: it's not easy on the hand, as you need a late entry to dummy to lead towards the 10|pg||
nt|finch: at this point declarer can decide whether to ruff another diamond in dummy, or as Jeffrey suggests discard a diamond on the heart and lead the @SQ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|mcarroll: W obviously did not like the @D void, and it is unlikely that Pd is 2-2 in the majors so there will be either a 4-3 or 5-2 fit but still I wonder |pg||
pc|c4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|finch: once West has turned up with the @DA, the @SK is very likely to be East|pg||
