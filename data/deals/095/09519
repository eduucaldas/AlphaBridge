nt|marlowepi: welcome back all|pg||
nt|athene: this board might get passed out?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, though W might open|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and S might in 3rd seat|pg||

mb|3C|nt|mamos: can there be too many Catherines? |pg||

mb|p|nt|eggy: NS system card on http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/systems/mcmahon-kirby.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: Play ball!|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: My Co-commentators are David Collier, Catherine Draper and Mark Horton and I am Geoffrey Wolfarth |pg||
nt|dburn: not much of an opening bid, those North cards, but these days almost anything goes|pg||
nt|ady: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: X = minor-major?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: hi good evening everyone |pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|athene: club lead will get the defence off to a good start|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi stephen - do we know the systems in use?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: not off hand...|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stayman was not out of the question|pg||
nt|athene: not only is it safe, but east gets to make two discards which might be helpful|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you were right in a way about the auction Bill. it was passed out. after the opening bid, that is :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes, stayman was a possibility with the north hand (intending to pass any rebid from opener)|pg||
nt|dburn: 1NT alerted - may be forcing, I guess, but about 2@c I am not sure|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: south is bidding a lot|pg||
nt|eggy: Just when West thought it was starting to look good|pg||
nt|henryb: then 2@h = pass or correct|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe South thinks it's a transfer and North doesn't|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case the final contract could be somewhat less than elegant|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk7: Your commentators are Marshall Lewis and William Frisby|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@S looks makeable|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk7: Player names please operator|pg||
nt|athene: south has a very nice hand, even if she doesn't have a name yet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: usually they make it through a few hands before they play anonymously|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a LOT off|pg||
nt|eggy: quite a poor bid by east on reflection|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: i can think of people who would open 2@C on that south hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi Catherine, Steve, Calle and Geoffrey. Havee fun :)|pg||
nt|dburn: not that there's much wrong with 2@d as a contract, but not by North-South|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  a bit of a push|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnc: Hi|pg||
nt|eggy: west almost guaranteed to hold 5 spade|pg||
nt|henryb: indeed: favorable breaks in all suits and @hA well placed|pg||
nt|mamos: whereas 1Nt would make so Catherine North has done well|pg||
nt|dburn: however, they seem to be on track|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: hi roland will do|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: a feisty auction and i am not sure whether this will be an objectively good result for the declaring side|pg||
nt|col3435: yes, how does 4@h do?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dburn: this ought not to make, but with the favourable red suit position East-West could make about 2NT, so no great harm done|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: 2S plays well. but 1NT can make also|pg||
nt|col3435: seems to me like it might come in|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: yes, there is the double heart finesse for declarer if she chooses to take it|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dburn: still, not so obvious for West to play a red suit ace now, which is what she needs to do|pg||
nt|dburn: although I guess @d3 might also work|pg||
nt|dburn: and might be more accurate defence|pg||
nt|dburn: the point being that by playing diamonds twice more, West can in effect create a trump trick for herself|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c9|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|roswolf: yes it may well but will e/w get there in the other room? n/s bidding i think helped|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dburn: but now she really does need to play a diamond, and not...|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|dburn: ...a spade|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rnc: South was quite happy I suppose when seeing dummy with 5 spades|pg||
nt|dburn: now, provided Cath Jagger takes the right view of the clubs, she can succeed|pg||
pc|c8|nt|col3435: I'd say West always had enough to bid 4@h after East had raised|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Let's suppose North cashed a top club and then switched to the jack of diamonds - quite testing for declarer then |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is all about the first round of hearts and cashing only one diamond before playing hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but she will surely throw a heart here|pg||

nt|marlowepi: zia for example|pg||
nt|athene: yes but 3-3 diamonds has the extra chance of a squeeze|pg||

nt|lestergold: hi Henry|pg||
nt|lestergold: and hi Catherine!!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: what is everyone thinking about?|pg||
nt|athene: dummy doesn't have what West is hoping for in 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome Mike|pg||
nt|sn00py27: hi|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@H looks normal|pg||
nt|henryb: Mike. May your addition errors make little difference and your spelling be reasonable|pg||
nt|lestergold: no chanse of that Hnry and 2+2=5 in my maths |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hi Roland and all |pg||
nt|sn00py27: hi|pg||
nt|henryb: your favorite 20-20, Roland|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwww|pg||
nt|athene: although if north leads her partner's suit that will help|pg||
nt|athene: ouch|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: very hard to disagnose though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E took a real chance here...|pg||
nt|ady: tranfer to hearts     likely down 2 at 2 level|pg||
nt|dburn: may be one major, rather than a transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north was doing the thinking :) i doubt east had to think too hard about that one|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure the auction should be taking this long|pg||
nt|dburn: not particularly sound whatever it is, mind|pg||
nt|dburn: still, no one can ever double anyone for penalties nowadays|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rnc: This one will for sure be cheaper|pg||
nt|henryb: you are obviously not an accountant.|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i do have an oxford maths degree if it was cambrisge then id be able to add up|pg||
nt|henryb: Pender thinks she has died and gone to heaven|pg||
nt|lestergold: in oxford they only taught me how to punt|pg||
nt|mamos: horses or skiffs?|pg||
nt|henryb: there is a story of the CEO who wanted to find out what 2+2=|pg||
nt|henryb: He called in his economists. they said 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: without birth control 2+2 can equal quite a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i might have bid something over 1@C as east|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sn00py27: I thought we might get an idea on this hand whether they play weak or strong NT :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In these times many East's would open - especially with an eye on the vulnerability|pg||
nt|sn00py27: E/W|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this should be easy enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: probably better to play in 7D. at least you go off only one when diamonds break your heart|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D must be showing something like north's hand - and south ought to be getting mildly excited|pg||
nt|col3435: some convention cards at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/lmteams.htm|pg||
nt|col3435: N/S play "Acol with 5-card majors and a strong NT"|pg||
nt|col3435: E/W card isn't there but I think they play strong+5 too|pg||
nt|sn00py27: Not quite Acol then !|pg||
nt|ady: this wont make    but n/s likely to make 8 tricks in 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the aces will take care of partner's @H+@C losers, however those two cards are split|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|nt|col3435: well, yes. Seems like a contradiction in terms to me. But that's what they say.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: @SJ10 might be useful fillers...@DAK9 is great|pg||
nt|henryb: he did not like that, so he called in his information tech people. wait a moment they said, we will check on the computer|pg||
pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: understandable that NS are hoping to create some action given the match score. but that 5C bid is infinitely more likely to widen the gap than to close it|pg||
nt|athene: East will be disappointed to get only her top trumps from here|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: admittedly you don't want to bid a grand slam when there is a chance they might not reach the small slam in the other room|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, so down two may show a profit, but there are easier ways to make a living|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: i am puzzled why N did not respond 2D|pg||
nt|athene: a 6-card minor is shorter than a 5-card major, for most people, these days|pg||
nt|col3435: (it probably just means "not 2/1 GF")|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: i am sorry to say|pg||
nt|eggy: good defence|pg||
nt|henryb: back they came. 4 they said|pg||
nt|lestergold: good start for Catherine|pg||
nt|henryb: he did not like that, so he called in the accountants|pg||
nt|lestergold: east may well be endoplayed more times thanm she likes for her visit to heavan|pg||
nt|henryb: What would you like it to be, they asked? :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: EW would probably get another trick if W continued spades, but that is not too likely|pg||
pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: but there is more to it than that. 2D has the advantage of announcing strength immediately also|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: i think with all those keycards for diamonds, south should not stop below 6@D after north bids 4@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suppose N was concerned about a rebid of 2H from S. but is 2D GF ion their methods? not normally in these countries, is it?|pg||
nt|athene: well, i don't know N-S's methods, but i am assuming Acol-ish, so things tend not to be forcing :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think both N and S are guilty of underbidding here|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chessmaste: 1NT is comfortable, might be a more interesting deal if East opens |pg||
nt|roswolf: ah i am glad we have a translator on the commentary team:)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c4|mc|12|pg||
qx|o3|st||md|1SKQT6HQ652D2C6432,SJ9754HA3DK6CJ975,SA32HK987DQT87CKQ,S8HJT4DAJ9543CAT8|sv|e|nt|athene: i would place more blame with south - north is worried that south has lots of kings and queens wasted in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Not a great line - there was an easy overtrick avalable|pg||
nt|roswolf: a 20/20 hcp hand - how high will e/w go?|pg||
nt|eggy: If S had continued spades from the top, N could have underplayed teh S5 for the same effect of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe it wa purgatory rather than heavan|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Roland would like this - a 20/20 deal|pg||
nt|ady: nice multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: that is the humnan reality, true, though in international matches one is more or less expected to overcome those foibles|pg||
nt|mamos: i think the hand was played rotated so op had problems  as it seems did the players and commentators|pg||
nt|mugsmate: That sort of multi makes me feel old. Routine when I was at university 15 years ago.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You are lucky, it makes *me* feel sick|pg||
nt|mugsmate: First in at favourable vulnerability is a good time to be a bit random, so long as your partner knows not to punish you.|pg||
nt|ady: if they get the club suit right then 3T will make|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: alerted as weak major, max 7pts|pg||
nt|mugsmate: The multi may be just what is required to protect that club queen.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that Multi may cause declarer not to get clubs right|pg||
nt|ady: Jagger may sacrifice in 4@H|pg||
mb|1N|mb|3D|nt|marlowepi: N should not have that worry when S cues 5C|pg||
nt|roswolf: will south fancy this hand?|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: i would be tempted to bid 2@C over 1@H with East |pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT overcall?|pg||
nt|henryb: over an opening 1@s do you overcall 1N or double and bid 2N|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT for me|pg||
nt|sn00py27: opp passed hand I am happy to settle with 1NT|pg||
nt|henryb: I think I would double and bid 2N actually|pg||
mb|r|nt|athene: east doubled 1@D intending to bid spades next and show a strong hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has announced a strong NT, and six is cold facing both round aces and diamond KQ, which is only 13|pg||
nt|chessmaste: South might protect |pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be finis|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1nt not unreasonable all acions are going to be distorted with this hand|pg||
nt|sn00py27: but I would do something with S - unless they play 2@C as conventional and she has no easy bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1n is the closest|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Just 3H. If you play this random style, you have to play it as a PARTNERSHIP. Jagger can't go to 4H when partner may be so weak.|pg||
nt|ady: 4H could be 500 or 800 |pg||
nt|dburn: trouble is, she still doesn't know which major her partner has|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: she doesn't really want her next decision to be selecting a lead to 1@DX|pg||
nt|athene: it's a pretty good suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: she appears to|pg||
nt|dburn: if it turns out to be spades, 4@s might even be making|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Interestingly, north has shown 4-4 in the majors and south has shown 5 hearts, so there is no real reason to get the clubs wrong anymore.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: south should bid 2c surely|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i wouldn;t need to be tempted. i would do it before temptation even arose|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i would not like to play the n/s hands at the 3 level but maybe that is why i am commentating these days|pg||
nt|henryb: yes, or double 1N would be my choice|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: hmmm this auction seems illogical|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Enterprising and unlucky to find partner with most of her points in spades|pg||
mc|6|nt|athene: i assume West in fact didn't pass|pg||
nt|sn00py27: should make 3@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: she has the theoretical values for a double but hand is too top heavy for it for my liking|pg||
nt|mamos: Pass would be a field if partner had psyched|pg||
nt|henryb: partner is third hand at favorable ...|pg||
pg||
qx|o4|st||md|2SQTH4D8764CAJ9652,SA93HK752DJ52CKQ8,SJ7HQT8DKQT9CT743,SK86542HAJ963DA3C|sv|b|nt|athene: another chance for a minor-suit slam here, for NS|pg||
nt|eggy: at least on the 800 hand - Stockdale bid the making game (5D)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|marlowepi: an awful lot of slams in this set already. what's up with that? a spec asked if this is goulasch LOL|pg||
nt|athene: Multi-2@D; east might try 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb: a bad unbiddable 3N?|pg||
nt|henryb: that happens to make|pg||
nt|ady: a diamond slam for e/w|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Six diamonds by east is a great spot here - the play complicated by the unlucky 3-0 trump break.|pg||
nt|ady: if they get the diamond right|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: now this could be fun|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mamos: 16 +8 will they bid 3NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: an awful lot of slam bidding, and vice versa :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: looks like the Multi. either that or everybody has a fatal attraction for the 2D card in the bidding box (as did S on the previous hand)|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D is certainly spades but hard to be sure what strength it shows|pg||
nt|athene: there are several schemes for rebids here, and west might be cautiously treating it as minimum or optimistically treating it as maximium|pg||
nt|rnc: And if bid and made twice, it'll be... 800 :)|pg||
nt|dburn: unlucky start to the auction - will now play the wrong way round for the Burn Percentage Play to work|pg||
nt|ady: if south does not lead a club   can make even mis guessing the diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 5C may not be a great idea when one opp has passed and your partner has not|pg||
nt|petepunt:  evening all|pg||

nt|marlowepi: hi peter|pg||
nt|petepunt:  hi we know the pairs|pg||
mb|2N|an|forces 3c|nt|roswolf: 2@D = multi or weak 2 diamonds?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: @D|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty|pg||
nt|eggy: If she'd tried 6, she'd have made that too I suppose|pg||
nt|dburn: however, after this start they may reach only 3NT anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: but East has done well|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|athene: i think north could afford to take it a bit slower|pg||
nt|athene: one opponent has passed|pg||
nt|athene: and you have a fair amount in the majors|pg||
nt|eggy: unless West leads a spade|pg||
nt|sn00py27: 1nt - 3NT ?|pg||
nt|henryb: at most 2N|pg||
nt|dburn: West has plenty of extra playing strength, but no really convenient way to show it|pg||
nt|mugsmate: I agree east hass done well, but a byproduct of 3S is that south may well lead a club now.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: tracy is in aggressive mood today|pg||
mb|3H|an|5sp 5H FG|nt|athene: @CAK @DAK for the defence here, and they don't have to find them right away|pg||
nt|athene: although they do have to be a little bit careful|pg||
nt|lestergold: combined 24 good intermediates 3n a fair shot and it makes comfortably on any lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and it's game-all - opps aren't at favourable or anything scary like that|pg||
nt|dburn: well, they are in six now|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sn00py27: East's bidding on this hand has worked well|pg||
nt|chessmaste: They have done well - hardly obvious to insist on game facing a weak two in diamonds|pg||
nt|sn00py27: good start|pg||
nt|lestergold: north should go|pg||
nt|dburn: or very shortly|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well they sort of do, after AK of clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnc: Yes|pg||
pc|d6|nt|henryb: look how bad this 3N is: needs both black suits to run and not to lose 4@d and the @sA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: yes, they do now|pg||
nt|lestergold: its far from throw against wall but i think that its a vulnerable game that should be bid|pg||
pc|d9|nt|dburn: one indication may come if South leads @c10, though - short clubs implies long diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: excellent slam  will be unlucky to go down|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|sn00py27: v poor until everything breaks :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: could @DA and another ever be wrong?|pg||
nt|lestergold: its thinnish but tghe intermediates create additional chances as here with clubs breaking 4/2 but the ten of clubs to the rescue etc|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade intermediates good- dims can b e blocked or notm led when they are 5/3|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would want to be in this game|pg||
nt|henryb: It is about 50% for each black suit. so both is 25%. you have some other chances but not many|pg||
nt|dburn: well, I would go down for sure, but East may draw the right inference|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Perhaps east will deduce the lead is from shortage, so cater to trump length with the leader.|pg||

nt|dburn: good shot|pg||
nt|ady: got it right|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d3|nt|henryb: this is a BAD gam. you only want to be there because you can see the favorable breaks|pg||

nt|tejjyid: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: TD called; instead of opening lead she put hand down as dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Oh dear, 13 penalty cards|pg||
nt|tejjyid: must be earlyin the AM|pg||
nt|tejjyid: before the 1st cup of coffee|pg||
nt|Walddk7: If all cards are exposed, they are all penalty cards|pg||
nt|Walddk7: And declarer can choose in which order they should be played|pg||
nt|tejjyid: contract should make then...|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: Laughter all round|pg||
nt|Walddk7: @CK lead would be a good start for declarer, so she will likely to choose that card|pg||
nt|tejjyid: @C K lead, followed by @HK |pg||
nt|tejjyid: then pitch all the @S |pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: Gordon having difficulty finding this in his book|pg||
nt|marlowepi: an unusual type of double dummy problem|pg||
nt|marlowepi: declarer cursing her luck "why doesnt this ever happen when we bid a dicey slam???"|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: We're skipping this awaiting a decision|pg||
nt|eggy: a bit wet that pass|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   inlikely to get into the auction    looks like 2@S  n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: that is tracy's style|pg||
nt|dburn: a couple of small swings to England in the first three boards - they might have been larger, but ...|pg||
mb|4C|nt|chessmaste: North passed - we have some sound bidders on VuGraph today |pg||
nt|roswolf: will the rabbi'c rule be applied?|pg||

nt|athene: in the other room, north led a heart|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|nt|petepunt:  looks lie 9 tricks with care|pg||
nt|athene: the @H9 comes down|pg||
nt|athene: so you don't need to ruff any hearts|pg||
nt|eggy: unlike the 3S opener, - even at this vul|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|rnc: South might have had some hopes for a trump trick|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|petepunt:  can cross ruff high anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: could make ten tricks perhaps by a loser-on-loser? lead @DJ, throw club on it|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: then throw another club on the @D10?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chessmaste: See|pg||

nt|mamos: welcome|pg||
nt|ady: e/w should get to 3NT     may have a problem to make  |pg||
mb|1S|nt|eggy: well just to get some information about how to defeat it would have been OK I think!|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the Irish in 6@D on board 2, i am told|pg||
nt|athene: so that's 2 slam swings out of 2 so far!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|petepunt:  looks like|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: that is a sound 2@s overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: we need an undo? - 2@C from East, rather than South|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that sort of thing doesnt usually happen in the first half of the set|pg||
nt|athene: stayman now, and pass 2@H?|pg||
nt|rnc: Yes, you're quite right , Catherine. South will either be squeezed or, if playing !K, East will set up a @D-trick|pg||
nt|rnc: !K = @DK :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: sorry about connection problems|pg||
nt|henryb: E-W make 2N or 3@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: not only is 3h icy but on a spade lead 4h is cold|pg||
nt|mamos: im told South made 2@H +2 on Board 5 we missed|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: i would bid 2@H over 1@H with the north hand|pg||
nt|petepunt:  prefer 6@H for that|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North gets lucky|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petepunt:  6nt on board 2 was tough to make|pg||
nt|petepunt:  NI pair in OR possibly most experienced in event|pg||
nt|athene: i admit the north heart holding, whilst strong, isn't ideal -  you don't have a tenace where you can exploit being over the known length|pg||
nt|athene: but even so, the hand is good enough that i would get in there|pg||
nt|petepunt:  bur I would balance with 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: if south now avoids the heart lead   will be more difficult|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dburn: not as big a problem as South would have|pg||
nt|dburn: better undo this auction|pg||
nt|mugsmate: needs a pass inserted, vugraph operator:)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|petepunt:  9 tricks again -  but i was wrong last time :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: a very comfortable contract here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: who put dummy down?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Suit quality is a factor for some players|pg||
nt|roswolf: provoking opps to bid a game which they might not have reached unaided is the downside of such pre-empts|pg||
nt|sn00py27: not to mention the 500 that was on offer from 4@H :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: True, but assuming South would have opened 1@D game was sure to be reached|pg||
nt|roswolf: a more telling point catherine!|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Hard to double 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: in my view east should bid 3h over 2s- amaybe a slight overbid but she is under pressure and partner needs to know how good those hearst are|pg||
nt|lestergold: partner knows that she is under pressure|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n is appaling|pg||
nt|henryb: I do not agree. she is at least an ace light for 3@h|pg||
nt|ady: best lead|pg||

nt|dburn: ought to lead a low heart rather than an honour if she leads one at all, but this diamond may well prove effective|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: with thin stops double was unwise|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mamos: to be fair strong suits in weak hands can be dificult  I think East has shown her hand well|pg||
nt|lestergold: pushing them to 4h which as we can see cn make on a spade lead|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Good lead - partner hadn't doubled stayman & the opponents have a major each...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|chessmaste: We will soon be on to the next deal now|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 2 or 3 down|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: well now will east play the courageous and only line to make|pg||
nt|henryb: I think 4@h is cold on any lead, Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: u dont double one game in ordeer to push them into one u cant double|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes u are right henry |pg||
nt|sn00py27: that J@C onside will allow a discard whatever the lead I think|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk7: The lady on lead|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|nt|henryb: and I think N was wrong to double 3N, a contract she thinks she can beat|pg||
nt|lestergold: dims cant be enjoyed thru comunications lack|pg||
nt|sn00py27: I would have sat happily defending 3NT as North :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: i think "9 tricks" is a safer prediction this board|pg||
nt|Walddk7: She thought she was dummy|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|lestergold: why duck and let thyem attack diamonds|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|sn00py27: good effort the 10@S - they can see those clubs setting up|pg||
nt|mamos: better to double 3NT if you think you can beat 4@H :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry folks but this hand is one error after another ladies getting tired|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: i remember one time i was playing in a local duplicate and partner was on lead|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|dburn: may be down only one - can endplay either opponent, but not for nine tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|athene: and looked enquiringly at me (as in, to see if i had any questions)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this line by declarer is not so precise|pg||
nt|athene: and i said "small please, partner" without thinking|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: i guess i had been playing too many of them|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dburn: but this has scrambled her communications somewhat|pg||
pc|c9|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|tejjyid: the defense can tap dummy so thew @S suit is dead|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: east can see that a dim switch is horrid why did she duck the first spade?|pg||
nt|ady: its easier to end play opps from here David|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dburn: understandable, though - she had to hope to make something of the hearts, and wanted to keep @sA as an entry|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: lol|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s7|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|lestergold: east has not spotted that the contract depends upon the simple finese of the ten of clubs well it did|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|nt|eggy: a bit unfortunate lead I suppose|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: it's usually a mistake in hands like this to allow the defence to draw a third round of trumps|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c8|nt|roswolf: a club lead would have been testing|pg||

nt|athene: until it's right!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well, maybe North won't open that hand next time|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes "very comfortable" contracts just don;t fetch|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Aggressive bidding is a good tactic if your declarer play has the gift of squeezing the extra trick out of things|pg||
nt|chessmaste: This might be interesting|pg||
nt|eggy: as the natural think would be to take the losing spade view|pg||
nt|mamos: next case|pg||
nt|dburn: well defended, though - a fine opening lead|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: and if north bids spades enthusiastically, that can only help west|pg||
nt|athene: variable NT for N-S|pg||
nt|col3435: is West worth a double of 1@h, do you think?|pg||
nt|eggy: and get a club switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt:  1@S will do here|pg||
nt|lestergold: that case is best forgotten quickly Mike|pg||
nt|mamos: might even be passed out|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: not a hand for anyone to make anything|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Not for me - and it will give the game away here |pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|athene: west of course doesn't expect that her partner has so little wasted in spades|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt would have worked out fine as well, even though they are off the club suit|pg||
nt|ady: can make 2@H  |pg||
mb|3N|nt|diumraid: Current in Running Scores are as follows  N-IRELAND  19,  ENGLAND  16,   IRELAND  16,  SCOTLAND 14, CBAI 14, WALES  11|pg||
nt|col3435: a spade lead might also give the game away|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt:  3@S was possible with 2 aces,  but a bit thin for a slam try|pg||
nt|chessmaste: West will have an awkward lead against 4@H|pg||
nt|sn00py27: very dangerous with 4333|pg||
nt|mamos: are NS too high already?|pg||
nt|lestergold: that case may end up with fornsic investigators in the cold case files|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: they will play 4@S now and just lose @H @C @C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this deal looks like a 2-bid auction to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|sn00py27: I wd probably fish out the 4 @S - not a success here |pg||
nt|lestergold: well maybe they are but they havent done anything wrong yet|pg||
nt|dburn: or beat 1NT a trick - not perhaps altogether wise for South to volunteer to play the hand rather than defend it|pg||
pc|hK|nt|col3435: I'd have the @s4 on the table in a flash, and declarer would be very grateful|pg||
nt|sn00py27: not sure our support for the lead will make West feel any better !|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In one sense North did well not to respond 1@S  |pg||
pc|h4|nt|tejjyid: this looks safe enough - time for a quick cuppa|pg||
nt|dburn: but whether South or West bid 1NT, East was going to venture 2@h anyway|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petepunt:  predict 13?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: with the NOrth cards opposite a 15-17 NT, 3NTdirectly is tempting|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: what does 2c mean?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 2d?|pg||
nt|sn00py27: puppet to 2@D which you can pass if weak with @D|pg||
nt|henryb: transfer to 2@d; start of possibly invitational sequences|pg||
nt|mamos: i think this is a good piece of convention but not sure Souths hand is suitable|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah hah|pg||
nt|sn00py27: or make invitational bids - 2@D over 1NT would be GF|pg||
nt|mamos: gladiator|pg||
nt|lestergold: but what is wrong with 1n soutgh is not weak|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|henryb: by a passed hand perhaps not the best use of the bids|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|lestergold: 1n struggles mainly because of bad break in dimaonds! |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: certainly 13 now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|eggy: not Mike Lawrences view though|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: by which same token 8 tricks in diamonds becomes a tall order|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chessmaste: In some book I suggested a lead from a king was very dangerous - and a trump was also bad - plus underleading an ace was out of the question|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sn00py27: maybe in pairs ok, but too dangerous for me at imps|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade switch neede to cut off heart trick|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|c8|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: Henry with the greatest respect failure tio open a hand containing 3 aces is a hanging offence in these parts|pg||
nt|dburn: but declarer is giving herself plenty to do here, though she will probably survive|pg||
pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: sometimes it is good to use conventions in close decisions, as it keeps you from forgetting them|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c3|nt|athene: of course if you are worried partner is on the point of forgetting them, you have a knife-edge decision|pg||

nt|ady: think A@S was wrong    let the king get ruffed that way|pg||

mb|2C|nt|athene: 4@H or 3NT  good for E-W here but not trivial to reach|pg||

nt|eggy: My copy ofhis book seems to have gone AWOL, so I am afraid I can't reference it|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but was it well defended?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: 3nt just needs 4-3 spades or no spade lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: we have an extra pass in here, operator|pg||
nt|athene: need undo|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: the barrage will make things difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: well, this is fair enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: many pairs have ways to distinguish a good 2H raise from a nuisance raise over doublke|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H might be a much weaker hand - it would be useful to have 2@D available as a good 3-card raise|pg||
nt|petepunt:  2@d best used as a 8-10 3 card raise|pg||
nt|tejjyid: My least favourite standard auction|pg||

nt|lestergold: in any case this does not look like a hand likely to ive rise to any embarrasin post mortems|pg||

pc|c4|nt|petepunt:  when playing 5 card majors and strong nt after x|pg||
nt|athene: the way the bidding went, west might have taken a view and bid game|pg||

nt|athene: you might survive a misguess in trumps if you can get diamonds going for a spade pitch|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a hand full of potential|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: sry - defence not quite on the right wavelength and made 9 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: that hand will leave a few scars on north|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: another coffee break hand we need a couple of these after the recent excitmenet|pg||
nt|henryb: a trivial 4@h for N-S|pg||
nt|dburn: a couple more small swings to England when 3NT went one down rather than three, and 3@h made where 2@h failed in this room|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1@D 1@H 1@S 1N by NS uncontested, perhaps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a 3C opener by E could start some racket|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is a similar hand - Mighjt go 1@H -2 @D ; 2@H all pass|pg||
nt|athene: well 1@D will certainly get them there!|pg||
nt|mamos: Making 2@D was worth 7 imps to England as 1NT went 2 off|pg||
nt|dburn: but they add up to a useful lead for England, who could do with a win if they are to challenge for the Lady Milne trophy|pg||
mb|1N|nt|tejjyid: OK, not any more|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not that it is likely with 3 in each major and a mediocre suit and adverse colors|pg||

nt|tejjyid: NOrth thinks 4@H is fit showing|pg||
nt|athene: responding 4@H at your first turn with that south hand expresses doubt as to partner's constructive bidding, i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: south's off shape double may complicate matters for everyone|pg||
nt|henryb: in my book 2@c is natural, nf and not particularly encouraging|pg||
nt|sn00py27: assuming it would be natural |pg||

mb|p|nt|diumraid: In Running Scores -   N-Ireland 19, England 18, CBAI 15, IRELAND 15, SCOTLAND 12, WALES 11|pg||
nt|athene: surely East is worth 2@C if her partner can double 1@D?|pg||
nt|athene: even if 4@H were fit-showing, surely you pass with @HKxx?|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Red save in 4S one off against 4H here due to the side fit in diamonds. In practise no-one could come in, let alone diagnose the double fit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: more likely north was scared it was a splinter?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she thought splinter|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 2@C non forcing is popular - but not with Acol players:)|pg||
nt|col3435: yes this 2@c is an Acoly bid|pg||
nt|col3435: E/W aren't playing Acol but I expect that is the influence here|pg||

nt|roswolf: well n/s may beat par|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|henryb: a very useful dummy. it is easy to construct one on which 4@h has no play|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: what is E worth if W can't double 1D but did anyway? most systems don;t cover that :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3@H will endplay partner - why not 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: lead holds it to 4 |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: but my book recommends transfers after the opponent's to doubles as an alternative|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: so would atrump lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tejjyid: Even with 13 penalty cards, this would be a tough hand to make|pg||

nt|sn00py27: that is what I play, but you miss out on playing 1NT sometimes :(|pg||

nt|athene: E-W might be in trouble here|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D is natural?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe 2 suited?|pg||
nt|athene: it might be diamonds + higher - that's a common form of run-out after 1nt x|pg||
nt|athene: south now waits hopefully for the takeout-double|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I doubt SOuth has much hope left|pg||
nt|roswolf: england need to pull their socks up and score some imps otherwise they will lose this match badly|pg||

nt|ady: part score hand    fairly low  |pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: the bad news of the4/1 trump break balancede by the favourable position of the spade K|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south might now bid 4@S, putting her partner with 55 majors|pg||
nt|athene: and being worried about clubs in 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s should play in 5@D quite easily|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: 3@C is aggressive here|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S is reasonable enough...she has shown her hand by doubling i guess|pg||
nt|athene: but of course there are all sort of subtle misunderstandings possible here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I feel 3@S usually has 5|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: assuming it's "standard"; i.e. game-forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this N hand looks a lot more like an overcall than did the S hand on   5|pg||
nt|henryb: On the lead of the @d3 a case can be made for playing low from dummy: North has only one higher card and S might have led high from many holdings including AK|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n just as good a spot|pg||
nt|mamos: ah so a variation|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: e.g. north might think that 3@S shows long spades and no diamond stop|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: time for the Hamman principle - bid 3NT if possible|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: the double seems dubious|pg||
nt|athene: east had better not rise with that @DK|pg||
nt|sn00py27: the game that geoffrey and david wanted to bid on board 8 has got home - a winning spade got discarded|pg||
nt|sn00py27: 6 imps to england|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Very strange as up to that point West had discarded perfectly |pg||
nt|lestergold: good plahy of 7 clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: dummy's stiff D will be a very welcome surprise|pg||
nt|athene: this will probably go down|pg||
nt|athene: there are only two obvious losers (@DA, trump)|pg||
nt|athene: but south can overruff spades|pg||
nt|athene: if you draw three rounds of trumps you have a couple of spade losers|pg||
nt|athene: since north has that precious @S8|pg||
nt|athene: dummy is a bit short of entries to get the hearts going|pg||
nt|athene: she knows her partner has nothing, more or less|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@H might actually have been the only making game?|pg||
nt|athene: a good example of how you want the weaker hand's long suit to be trumps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and why bother? if a major is going to be 3-3, much better for it to be spades|pg||
nt|athene: because it's useless otherwise|pg||
nt|athene: yes, sure|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: now 11 tricks available|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mugsmate: Close decision to pass 2D - 2H certainly a possible choice by south. That Jxx in the suit on the right is a big turnoff though when spades aren't raised.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: i dont think 4H makes on best defense, does it?|pg||
nt|athene: i was just wondering...i thought it might come home, but maybe not|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: the diamond lead was not well conceived. W should lead a trump|pg||
nt|athene: to be fair, it was just about possible for west to have the @DQ i suppose|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all W needed was the J|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: heart ace anbd a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will play @SAK, ruff, and lose the three obvious tricks, i imagine|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: any plain suit W might lead would be pretty much a shot in the dark. at least when you lead a trump you know what your goal is, and that your lead is a step toward that goal|pg||
pc|s8|nt|tejjyid: this is a deep game|pg||

nt|ady: e/w will make the obvious 5 tricks|pg||
mc|11|nt|marlowepi: W knows NS have no extras--no extra HCP and probably no extra trumps. There may be short suits in the NS hands, so a trump stands out|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think west had all that much to go on....partner didn't double 3@D but that was about it|pg||

mb|4H|nt|athene: now she knows it was right to bid on|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: East did well not to get over-excited - she does have quite a lot of HCP for a simple overcall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: really? she opened a rag. maybe all she lost is diff between 50 & 100 while anything by NS going for 300|pg||

pc|d4|nt|eggy: but should lose on the ill-judged 5@H hand|pg||
nt|sn00py27: they are playing 5CM, that's why I said Mike :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: and indeed the opening bid have cost the defence a trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: as predicted|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||

nt|athene: as the cards lie|pg||
nt|col3435: maybe unsure about which suit a cue-bid would be agreeing|pg||
nt|sn00py27: maybe she is thinking minimum, but with so many controls this is better|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 5@D very strange|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: yp east did well to bid 6 in the end|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: if the defence led trumps to stop a diamond ruff, declarer could just ruff the clubs good with the @DA as entry|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: can she set up a long heart to make this?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S is worth another call, i think--N could have:  xxx  Qxxxxx  KQx   x. i would double 3C to show extras|pg||
nt|athene: south has to attack dummy's entries|pg||
nt|athene: to prevent declarer ruffing the hearts good and getting back to them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and above all (still on the last hand), if S had stiff spade king, wouldnt she have at least thought a long time about playing three rounds of clubs, since pd could uppercut ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dummy's ace if N had spade ten or jack?|pg||
nt|eggy: Did well I think, to heed the gypsy's warning - I can't imagine Tracy passing 2S|pg||
nt|henryb: makes 4 without an immediate @d shift|pg||
nt|sn00py27: dummy must have been a welcome sight|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: makes 4 without an immediate @d shift|pg||

pc|d2|nt|athene: now declarer draws trumps and plays a heart, if she reads the cards correctly|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tejjyid: the clues were there...|pg||
nt|lestergold: zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz|pg||
nt|sn00py27: board 11 got opened a weak NT at other table and got them -500 for the trouble|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|athene: gotta duck that @CQ :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: south can play a diamond but declarer just ducks|pg||
nt|athene: wins the next diamond, ruffs @H, leads spade up|pg||
nt|athene: and south is out of diamonds|pg||
nt|eggy: Although she might make 9 tricks I suppose|pg||

nt|mugsmate: Attacking dummy's entries to stop declarer eloping with small trumps is good defense.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|athene: the trump switch at trick 2 was unlikely to help, but south just wanted to play safely, i imagine|pg||
nt|ady: better to have ruffed a club then|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: even if declarer led a club from hand to the @CQ you should probably duck with east|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: but surely @SA and @SQ was safe?|pg||
nt|athene: and when she leads the @CQ, advertising great strength in the suit, it's more clear|pg||
nt|tejjyid: after 1@D - !NT, the NT bidder usually has @C length|pg||
