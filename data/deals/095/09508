mb|1C|nt|bobh1: this first hand is a bit of a misfit so the issue might be who gets stuck holding the hot potatoe|pg||

mb|5D|nt|mmmakela: that's it I guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: only part scores here..... though 2@D NS  is not their optimum spot|pg||

mb|d|nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stayman was not out of the question|pg||
nt|athene: not only is it safe, but east gets to make two discards which might be helpful|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you were right in a way about the auction Bill. it was passed out. after the opening bid, that is :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes, stayman was a possibility with the north hand (intending to pass any rebid from opener)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: south is bidding a lot|pg||
nt|eggy: Just when West thought it was starting to look good|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Your commentators are Marshall Lewis and William Frisby|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk7: Player names please operator|pg||
nt|athene: south has a very nice hand, even if she doesn't have a name yet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: usually they make it through a few hands before they play anonymously|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a LOT off|pg||
nt|eggy: quite a poor bid by east on reflection|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: i can think of people who would open 2@C on that south hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi Catherine, Steve, Calle and Geoffrey. Havee fun :)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|rnc: Hi|pg||
nt|eggy: west almost guaranteed to hold 5 spade|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: hi roland will do|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: a feisty auction and i am not sure whether this will be an objectively good result for the declaring side|pg||
nt|col3435: yes, how does 4@h do?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: 2S plays well. but 1NT can make also|pg||
nt|col3435: seems to me like it might come in|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|athene: yes, there is the double heart finesse for declarer if she chooses to take it|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: yes it may well but will e/w get there in the other room? n/s bidding i think helped|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|rnc: South was quite happy I suppose when seeing dummy with 5 spades|pg||
pc|d9|nt|col3435: I'd say West always had enough to bid 4@h after East had raised|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Let's suppose North cashed a top club and then switched to the jack of diamonds - quite testing for declarer then |pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: it is all about the first round of hearts and cashing only one diamond before playing hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but she will surely throw a heart here|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|nt|rnc: yes|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: -800 seems predestined|pg||
nt|eggy: lucky it wasn't 1100 on that line|pg||

nt|werge: A good guesser might mahe a lot of tricks E/W in a @S-contract|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mmmakela: this looks interesting|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: bet in 5-level pretty quickly|pg||
nt|werge: 6 @S is lay-down double-dummy|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mariner1: 5@S makes, 6@H is a save IF they can drop the K@C, a Rabbi would.........|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mariner1: Rabbi's Rule = when the king is singleton play the Ace|pg||
nt|mmmakela: even being vul 3 @H very tame|pg||
nt|werge: West has a good hand - after N/S´s @D-bidding|pg||
nt|chick: at this vul, NS can't even take the @D sacrifice|pg||
nt|phil: even 4@d is too expensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: They are allready at 500|pg||
mb|2S|nt|phil: wow!|pg||
nt|werge: 6 @S is better|pg||
nt|chick: choice of slam bid|pg||
nt|werge: A bad decision to bid slam - N/S have indicated bad breaks|pg||
nt|phil: note that South is going to be endplayed after winning the @cK, which will negate one of the guesses - assuming declarer takes the time to eliminate diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: good rule in the long run..|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|phil: in clubs anyway.....|pg||
mb|3D|nt|werge: You "only" need to guess trumps here...|pg||
nt|phil: right|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|phil: should North follow with the 10 on the 2nd round? |pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: (in spades)?|pg||
nt|werge: Shall we see North follow the @S 10 in second trumd-round...?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: zia for example|pg||
nt|athene: yes but 3-3 diamonds has the extra chance of a squeeze|pg||
nt|marlowepi: my comment refers to how to discrd from dummy on the spades|pg||
nt|athene: which would have worked there|pg||
nt|sn00py27: have I missed all the fun ! |pg||
mb|1D|nt|sn00py27: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: not quite tracy went for-800|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 7nt here for N-S if they want it enough....bringing in AK9 / J10xxxx isn't bad odds for a grand|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: what is everyone thinking about?|pg||
nt|athene: dummy doesn't have what West is hoping for in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwww|pg||
nt|athene: although if north leads her partner's suit that will help|pg||
nt|athene: ouch|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: very hard to disagnose though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E took a real chance here...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north was doing the thinking :) i doubt east had to think too hard about that one|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rnc: This one will for sure be cheaper|pg||
pc|s9|nt|roswolf: i might have bid something over 1@C as east|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sn00py27: I thought we might get an idea on this hand whether they play weak or strong NT :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In these times many East's would open - especially with an eye on the vulnerability|pg||
nt|sn00py27: E/W|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this should be easy enough|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably better to play in 7D. at least you go off only one when diamonds break your heart|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D must be showing something like north's hand - and south ought to be getting mildly excited|pg||
nt|col3435: some convention cards at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/lmteams.htm|pg||
nt|col3435: N/S play "Acol with 5-card majors and a strong NT"|pg||
nt|col3435: E/W card isn't there but I think they play strong+5 too|pg||
nt|sn00py27: Not quite Acol then !|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: the aces will take care of partner's @H+@C losers, however those two cards are split|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s2|nt|col3435: well, yes. Seems like a contradiction in terms to me. But that's what they say.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: @SJ10 might be useful fillers...@DAK9 is great|pg||
pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: understandable that NS are hoping to create some action given the match score. but that 5C bid is infinitely more likely to widen the gap than to close it|pg||
nt|athene: East will be disappointed to get only her top trumps from here|pg||
pc|h9|pc|sA|nt|athene: admittedly you don't want to bid a grand slam when there is a chance they might not reach the small slam in the other room|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am puzzled why N did not respond 2D|pg||
nt|athene: a 6-card minor is shorter than a 5-card major, for most people, these days|pg||
nt|col3435: (it probably just means "not 2/1 GF")|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: i am sorry to say|pg||
nt|eggy: good defence|pg||
pc|h2|pc|sJ|nt|marlowepi: EW would probably get another trick if W continued spades, but that is not too likely|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but there is more to it than that. 2D has the advantage of announcing strength immediately also|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: i think with all those keycards for diamonds, south should not stop below 6@D after north bids 4@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suppose N was concerned about a rebid of 2H from S. but is 2D GF ion their methods? not normally in these countries, is it?|pg||
nt|athene: well, i don't know N-S's methods, but i am assuming Acol-ish, so things tend not to be forcing :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think both N and S are guilty of underbidding here|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|chessmaste: 1NT is comfortable, might be a more interesting deal if East opens |pg||
nt|roswolf: ah i am glad we have a translator on the commentary team:)|pg||

pc|s4|pc|c7|pc|d3|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h5|pc|cJ|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: a mistake from declarer - she had to ruff a heart there|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d2|nt|athene: now the @C10 is going to score|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|eggy: almost|pg||

nt|bobh1: he probably figured--"why didn't he strip the hand?" . . . |pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: 6 @C seems to be lay-down. South is end-played after ruffing @D - and he must "give" away the @H-suit. Now it looks like a show-up squeeze against North - and that will tell, who ...|pg||
nt|werge: is in position of the cricial @S Queen|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|mariner1: 5@C DBL made so a big swing to Galim|pg||
nt|werge: crucial|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: looks like 4@s which will depend on guessing the club Q (or maybe a misdefense)|pg||
nt|werge: You get an extra @C-trick, if South plays ruff and discard|pg||
nt|werge: As always: 3 NT is the contract...|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|phil: yes, 3N is excellent|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|bobh1: declarer followed the Zia Bols Bridge tip of many years ago--if they don't cover, they don't have it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 3 NT little stretchy, 2 NT enough imo|pg||
nt|mariner1: likely is down,,,,,, 3@H 1@D and 1@C to lose|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: yes avoid the 6-4 fit|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|phil: only the commentators can reach it however, in real life, everyone plays 4@s :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And now it all depends on finding @CQ|pg||
nt|werge: This is tricky, two rounds of @S - and a @D, this will bring E/W in trouble|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|mmmakela: see the heart spots Rob|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|pg||
nt|phil: I think East needs to rise with the K@d early|pg||
nt|werge: No need to find the @C Q, I think|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mariner1: oh I missed one... right,,,,,,,,, 2@H to lose|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mcarroll: True - give up the lead in @D and the opps have to help declarer|pg||
nt|werge: When East rises with the @D K, declarer will know - from the NOT-lead, where the @D Ace is -. and make the contract, West is endplyed|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|mcarroll: Sorry give a @H|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|phil: lose heart, diamond to King, diamond to Jack - if declarer plays for split diamonds, he can claim|pg||
nt|phil: right, strong inference on the non-diamond lead|pg||
nt|werge: He KNOWS, that they split - from the (I repeat) NOT-lead of a high @D|pg||
mc|9|nt|phil: furthermore, would west pass with @hK / @d AKJ? |pg||
pg||
qx|c19|st||md|1S72H532DA932CKJ96,S4HQJ97D8754CA743,SAKT8HAKT6DK6CT52,SQJ9653H84DQJTCQ8|sv|e|nt|athene: i would place more blame with south - north is worried that south has lots of kings and queens wasted in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Not a great line - there was an easy overtrick avalable|pg||
nt|roswolf: a 20/20 hcp hand - how high will e/w go?|pg||
nt|eggy: If S had continued spades from the top, N could have underplayed teh S5 for the same effect of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Roland would like this - a 20/20 deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: that is the humnan reality, true, though in international matches one is more or less expected to overcome those foibles|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N should not have that worry when S cues 5C|pg||
nt|roswolf: will south fancy this hand?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: i would be tempted to bid 2@C over 1@H with East |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east doubled 1@D intending to bid spades next and show a strong hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has announced a strong NT, and six is cold facing both round aces and diamond KQ, which is only 13|pg||
nt|chessmaste: South might protect |pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be finis|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: she doesn't really want her next decision to be selecting a lead to 1@DX|pg||
nt|athene: it's a pretty good suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: she appears to|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i wouldn;t need to be tempted. i would do it before temptation even arose|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i would not like to play the n/s hands at the 3 level but maybe that is why i am commentating these days|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: hmmm this auction seems illogical|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Enterprising and unlucky to find partner with most of her points in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i assume West in fact didn't pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: No, it's mainly because you are not a woman|pg||
nt|roswolf: east has saved the opps bacon|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They won't allow you in even if you shave, Geoffrey|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: either South or West probably bid 1@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you dont want a spade lead from Txxxx or some rubbish against 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: presumably south denied 4 spades by bidding 2nt|pg||
nt|sn00py27: as 8 counts go - it is quite decent|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes has the 2 extra 9's|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: maybe N simply did the multiplication and made the bid that would complete the equation|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3@H I don't care for|pg||
nt|chessmaste: or 3@S|pg||
nt|sn00py27: me neither, was thinking of passing back to partner or 2NT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: well, good old partner found a club lead anyway :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 3@S was very hasty|pg||
nt|col3435: yes it ought to be possible for N/S to scramble to their best fit after the Dbl|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3@S has two chances - slim and none|pg||
nt|col3435: but evidently a confident 3@h has its merits|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: and 1NT or 2NT is a likely enough rebid for S|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|roswolf: it is not devoid of hope - defence may assist|pg||
nt|rnc: Due to the CC, a direct 2NT would have been xfer to @D - so this will presumably be their way to invite "1NT-2NT"|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: why didn't south rebid 1@S?|pg||

pc|d5|nt|sn00py27: you would think that S had the count of hearts|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Graham Kirby would never have done that:)|pg||

nt|athene: until it's right!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well, maybe North won't open that hand next time|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes "very comfortable" contracts just don;t fetch|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Aggressive bidding is a good tactic if your declarer play has the gift of squeezing the extra trick out of things|pg||
nt|chessmaste: This might be interesting|pg||
nt|eggy: as the natural think would be to take the losing spade view|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: and if north bids spades enthusiastically, that can only help west|pg||
nt|athene: variable NT for N-S|pg||
nt|col3435: is West worth a double of 1@h, do you think?|pg||
nt|eggy: and get a club switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt:  1@S will do here|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Not for me - and it will give the game away here |pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|athene: west of course doesn't expect that her partner has so little wasted in spades|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt would have worked out fine as well, even though they are off the club suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|diumraid: Current in Running Scores are as follows  N-IRELAND  19,  ENGLAND  16,   IRELAND  16,  SCOTLAND 14, CBAI 14, WALES  11|pg||
nt|col3435: a spade lead might also give the game away|pg||
mb|3D|nt|petepunt:  3@S was possible with 2 aces,  but a bit thin for a slam try|pg||
nt|chessmaste: West will have an awkward lead against 4@H|pg||
nt|sn00py27: very dangerous with 4333|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: they will play 4@S now and just lose @H @C @C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this deal looks like a 2-bid auction to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|sn00py27: I wd probably fish out the 4 @S - not a success here |pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: I'd have the @s4 on the table in a flash, and declarer would be very grateful|pg||
nt|sn00py27: not sure our support for the lead will make West feel any better !|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In one sense North did well not to respond 1@S  |pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: this looks safe enough - time for a quick cuppa|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petepunt:  predict 13?|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|chessmaste: In some book I suggested a lead from a king was very dangerous - and a trump was also bad - plus underleading an ace was out of the question|pg||

nt|roswolf: this might produce a tilt at gamee by n/s|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|roswolf: 6@D might well be on here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: 4@H or 3NT  good for E-W here but not trivial to reach|pg||
nt|petepunt:  west worth a raise  to 3@Hat some stage|pg||
nt|eggy: My copy ofhis book seems to have gone AWOL, so I am afraid I can't reference it|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|athene: 3nt just needs 4-3 spades or no spade lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: we have an extra pass in here, operator|pg||
nt|athene: need undo|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the barrage will make things difficult|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|col3435: well, this is fair enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: many pairs have ways to distinguish a good 2H raise from a nuisance raise over doublke|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H might be a much weaker hand - it would be useful to have 2@D available as a good 3-card raise|pg||
nt|petepunt:  2@d best used as a 8-10 3 card raise|pg||
nt|tejjyid: My least favourite standard auction|pg||
nt|tejjyid: SOuth's pass is very conservative |pg||
nt|athene: i wouldn't be happy as south about never showing the most important feature of my hand - my spade fit|pg||
nt|eggy: 4@S is doubled on 21 in the closed|pg||
mb|4N|nt|tejjyid: North might still have a 6 card @S suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: no ambition today|pg||

mb|p|nt|petepunt:  when playing 5 card majors and strong nt after x|pg||
nt|athene: the way the bidding went, west might have taken a view and bid game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S seems quite s stretch to these timid eyes :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3NT has little chance on a spade lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: that may well be an overbid but it should work|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: yes, 3@S looks very aggressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnc: Seems to reach it now...or at least on their way|pg||
mb|6D|nt|petepunt:  a good "save" here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if you are going to use those spades for ruffing hearts, you can't count the 8 hcp for AKJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if W shows a good raise, E is worth at least a game invitation|pg||
nt|petepunt:  Lizcummins struggles with the concept of the pass card :)|pg||

nt|athene: a thin 4@H might be reached NS|pg||
nt|athene: you might survive a misguess in trumps if you can get diamonds going for a spade pitch|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a hand full of potential|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: sry - defence not quite on the right wavelength and made 9 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: that hand will leave a few scars on north|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1@D 1@H 1@S 1N by NS uncontested, perhaps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a 3C opener by E could start some racket|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is a similar hand - Mighjt go 1@H -2 @D ; 2@H all pass|pg||
nt|athene: well 1@D will certainly get them there!|pg||
mb|1D|nt|tejjyid: OK, not any more|pg||
mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: not that it is likely with 3 in each major and a mediocre suit and adverse colors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, that is the easiest way to survive a misguess in trumps....stay low:)|pg||
nt|athene: really 4@H? or are we just skipping to the final contract?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: safety play against wimping out later|pg||
nt|sn00py27: i would prefer 3@D by south or 4.....|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@D DOES SEEM RIGHT|pg||
mb|d!|mb|5H|nt|athene: i expected 1@D to silence West :) but she was not so easily silenced!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrth thinks 4@H is fit showing|pg||
nt|athene: responding 4@H at your first turn with that south hand expresses doubt as to partner's constructive bidding, i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: south's off shape double may complicate matters for everyone|pg||
nt|henryb: in my book 2@c is natural, nf and not particularly encouraging|pg||
nt|sn00py27: assuming it would be natural |pg||
nt|roswolf: another poor decision except tracy seems to have jumped into the fire|pg||
nt|eggy: That seems a bit premature surely!|pg||

nt|eggy: why poor?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: Madden doesnt sound like an Italian name|pg||
nt|tejjyid: We need the WWF to step in and save the Wales|pg||

mb|p|nt|diumraid: In Running Scores -   N-Ireland 19, England 18, CBAI 15, IRELAND 15, SCOTLAND 12, WALES 11|pg||
nt|athene: surely East is worth 2@C if her partner can double 1@D?|pg||
nt|athene: even if 4@H were fit-showing, surely you pass with @HKxx?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: more likely north was scared it was a splinter?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she thought splinter|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 2@C non forcing is popular - but not with Acol players:)|pg||
nt|col3435: yes this 2@c is an Acoly bid|pg||
nt|col3435: E/W aren't playing Acol but I expect that is the influence here|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: about to bid 3NT - shakes head and changes mind|pg||
nt|eggy: 5@Dx looks to be the par spot|pg||
nt|roswolf: north has been affected i think by the result on the previous hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: well n/s may beat par|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: what is E worth if W can't double 1D but did anyway? most systems don;t cover that :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3@H will endplay partner - why not 3NT|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|henryb: but my book recommends transfers after the opponent's to doubles as an alternative|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|tejjyid: Even with 13 penalty cards, this would be a tough hand to make|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Good method|pg||
nt|sn00py27: that is what I play, but you miss out on playing 1NT sometimes :(|pg||

pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: N's eyes may fall out on the next round of diamonds when she sees who fails|pg||
nt|chessmaste: well, the same one down as 3NT (assuming a diamond lead)|pg||
nt|col3435: I can't see how you can overcome the spade split here|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|henryb: not badly as in DOIGB (Down One Is Good Bridge) :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: statistically, the odds favor this not being the first time the potential ambiguity of this auction has come up. in that case S might have reflected that a response of 1H--however ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pedestrian--would go a long way towards getting partner to pass over an eventual 4H|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|h6|nt|chessmaste: On Board 7 North did bid spades so West led a club - game swing to CBAI|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: well, west's spade return is a sure sign she hasn't got anything better to retrun (like a club)|pg||

nt|athene: it might be diamonds + higher - that's a common form of run-out after 1nt x|pg||
nt|athene: south now waits hopefully for the takeout-double|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I doubt SOuth has much hope left|pg||
nt|roswolf: england need to pull their socks up and score some imps otherwise they will lose this match badly|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|athene: south might now bid 4@S, putting her partner with 55 majors|pg||
nt|athene: and being worried about clubs in 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s should play in 5@D quite easily|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 3@C is aggressive here|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S is reasonable enough...she has shown her hand by doubling i guess|pg||
nt|athene: but of course there are all sort of subtle misunderstandings possible here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I feel 3@S usually has 5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: assuming it's "standard"; i.e. game-forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this N hand looks a lot more like an overcall than did the S hand on   5|pg||
nt|henryb: On the lead of the @d3 a case can be made for playing low from dummy: North has only one higher card and S might have led high from many holdings including AK|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: e.g. north might think that 3@S shows long spades and no diamond stop|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||

pc|h8|nt|marlowepi: the double seems dubious|pg||
nt|athene: east had better not rise with that @DK|pg||
nt|sn00py27: the game that geoffrey and david wanted to bid on board 8 has got home - a winning spade got discarded|pg||
nt|sn00py27: 6 imps to england|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Very strange as up to that point West had discarded perfectly |pg||
pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: dummy's stiff D will be a very welcome surprise|pg||
nt|athene: this will probably go down|pg||
nt|athene: there are only two obvious losers (@DA, trump)|pg||
nt|athene: but south can overruff spades|pg||
nt|athene: if you draw three rounds of trumps you have a couple of spade losers|pg||
nt|athene: since north has that precious @S8|pg||
nt|athene: dummy is a bit short of entries to get the hearts going|pg||
nt|athene: she knows her partner has nothing, more or less|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H might actually have been the only making game?|pg||
nt|athene: a good example of how you want the weaker hand's long suit to be trumps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and why bother? if a major is going to be 3-3, much better for it to be spades|pg||
nt|athene: because it's useless otherwise|pg||
nt|athene: yes, sure|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: i dont think 4H makes on best defense, does it?|pg||

pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: the diamond lead was not well conceived. W should lead a trump|pg||

nt|athene: declarer will play @SAK, ruff, and lose the three obvious tricks, i imagine|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: any plain suit W might lead would be pretty much a shot in the dark. at least when you lead a trump you know what your goal is, and that your lead is a step toward that goal|pg||

mb|p|nt|chessmaste: You might get to 7@D - it should make|pg||

mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: switch the five and ten of spades and 4S would go down|pg||
nt|tejjyid: X sugesting the @H fragment?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after the hes by S, N has to double|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south can't be very happy about 4@S getting passed out|pg||
nt|rnc: and might even pick some badly needed on 24|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|athene: now she knows it was right to bid on|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: East did well not to get over-excited - she does have quite a lot of HCP for a simple overcall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: really? she opened a rag. maybe all she lost is diff between 50 & 100 while anything by NS going for 300|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: 4@S makes as the cards lie but that's very lucky|pg||
nt|eggy: true - could be 14 if NS bid 6D|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|roswolf: why not a cuebid from west?|pg||
nt|henryb: surely W should bid 6@d with all those controls, not 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: but should lose on the ill-judged 5@H hand|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: well it would be hard for E-W to double 5@C or 5@H i think|pg||
nt|athene: as the cards lie|pg||
nt|col3435: maybe unsure about which suit a cue-bid would be agreeing|pg||
nt|sn00py27: maybe she is thinking minimum, but with so many controls this is better|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 5@D very strange|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yp east did well to bid 6 in the end|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if the defence led trumps to stop a diamond ruff, declarer could just ruff the clubs good with the @DA as entry|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C was an alternative for West, over the double|pg||
nt|rnc: Even in game it will be 11 imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: this does not look favorite|pg||
pc|h6|nt|eggy: good lead|pg||

nt|tejjyid: I prefer X with the West cards, it seems to express the all-round values better|pg||
nt|sn00py27: no messing about with club bids here !|pg||
nt|roswolf: now blackwood is objective optimistic but here.....|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|col3435: well I quite like 4NT. You'll certainly find out what you need to know. The only problem is that sometimes what you find out is that you should be in 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it all went according to the script until south didn't double :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes i had actually worked out that W would raise hearts. the question was how and how many|pg||
nt|athene: if you transfer a king, then east has a pretty easy pass |pg||
mb|3H|nt|rnc: Yeh|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: now if that is 3 or zero south's next bid id clearcut|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i really don't know why south didn't double 1@H|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sn00py27: I wouldn't expect 4NT to be keycard there as you have so many ways to agree @H first|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: invitational to 8 or 9 ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: play will be quick|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: we will have to inform Peter Goodman that S has recovered her familiarity with the Pass card|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: starting to run into time trouble|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eggy: Kath seems to be playing the long game now - in order to preempt leaps from East|pg||
pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: a bit too chummy, that, i'd say|pg||

nt|marlowepi: always bid 4S when opps bid 4H|pg||
nt|sn00py27: I can only imagine that the double of 3@H on that board was supposed to be competitive - maybe giving a chance for 3NT before trying 5@D|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: south can double 2@S now?|pg||
nt|athene: i would have thought double describes your hand perfectly|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you are actually happier when east raises than if she had passed|pg||
nt|athene: declarer would like to take a double finesse in diamonds with this holding|pg||
nt|roswolf: where will this be played - 4@H?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: well, 3C describes the E hand considerably better than does 2S|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but getting to dummy twice isn't all that easy|pg||

nt|marlowepi: give. the successes of "tactical underbidding" are measly compared to those of the red-blooded philosophy|pg||
nt|athene: sorry the diamonds were a bit weaker than i thought|pg||
nt|athene: i thought declarer had the @D9|pg||
nt|athene: it wasn't a trivial hand|pg||
nt|athene: but starting with @DA means you are usually going to lose two tricks in the suit|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Roland asked us to be very kind - did he have inside information?|pg||
nt|henryb: calling it a comedy seems to me to be kind!|pg||
nt|col3435: I liked Henry's underlead at trick two, that's a much classier way to let it through :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: NO just experience!|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2 hands to go|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|athene: 6nt or 6@C here i guess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S rightly promotes her hand to a 2NT rebid|pg||
nt|athene: a diamond lead might worry you in 6nt a bit - 6@C looks better|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 21 HCP but far better than that due to long chunky suit and all primes|pg||
nt|tejjyid: need to enlist the defence to help|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w had difficulty finding their 5-3 heart fit|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: on the @D10 lead, in 6NT, you probably play east for the @DK @SQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: maybe just return a @H after trick one|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room|pg||
nt|eggy: CBAI collecting 5 more on 27|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: win @DA, run everything, and throw east in to lead a spade|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Yes, I asked commentators to treat the players with respect. I will stand by that view at all times whether you like it or not|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@H is an underbid by some way i think|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: maybe not|pg||
nt|athene: need another pass in there|pg||
nt|tejjyid: check please operator|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: and west gave them another chance|pg||
nt|sn00py27: I would dbl 2@C|pg||

nt|roswolf: north in the other room bid3@C |pg||
nt|roswolf: A GAME SWING IN TO ENGLAND|pg||
nt|sn00py27: if these are 5CM, I think 3@C with those good cards|pg||
nt|roswolf: makes the score more respectable|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|athene: on a non-diamond lead, you just play @SAK and another, probably|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe---that line is transparent enough that--IN PRINCIPLE--E can make you guess whether or not the spades are now stiff queen (after spade ace)|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|athene: i assumed it was some number of controls|pg||

nt|athene: 2@D = 0-1 control, 2@H = 2, 2@S = 3?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Having bid 2@H on the first round North might have recovered with a subtle 3@D on the next|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: (A=2, K=1)|pg||
nt|athene: but south obviously thought it was natural|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks infrangible and more imps to CBAI|pg||

nt|sn00py27: i was thinking it looked pretty safe on any lead, although I would favour a @H - dummy is probably with 4@S|pg||

nt|marlowepi: excellent compared to our usual slams Bill, but the right frame of comparison is vis a vis 6C|pg||

pc|h4|nt|rnc: And also to the audience for their tips...|pg||
nt|rnc: ...and to you Geoffrey|pg||
pc|h7|nt|col3435: well this looks good for 8 tricks at the very least|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: no doubt S would have doubled 3D if she didnt like the other unbid suit even better|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thanks to Lady Milne for inspiring the eponymous trophy that crowns this event|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: well that lead solves a certain problem for declarer|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the "9th trick" problem...|pg||
nt|athene: namely, where trick number nine is coming from|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|athene: the next match is coming up shortly - in about 30 minutes, i think|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: S retuirned her 4th best spade at Trick 2 as the books say one should. but probably not on this hand--to beat 3NT partner will need an entry--and even then where will we get 5 ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tricks? S should play back Q of spades hoping for a duck (correct if spades are 5-3), then if N turns up with only four spades (by following up the line), she can shift to diamonds|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|sn00py27: all she had to do on the last was cross to dummy' ace - finesse the diamond again and claim 9|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s9|nt|eggy: should hold this now as South has show 15 points|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|marlowepi: it won;t help on this hand, of course, but W might have only Jxx of clubs|pg||
nt|eggy: or not|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|rnc: She must have miscounted on her way|pg||
