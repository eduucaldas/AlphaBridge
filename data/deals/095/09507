nt|capercliff: welcome back folks!|pg||
nt|viren169: Hi|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning all - now we have another completely untried partnership in the Ireland EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
mb|1C|mb|2H!|nt|viren169: It will be interesting to see how West copes with 2@H from South|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S will not be great success |pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe.....|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Hi all - Hi Shirley  John Comyn here|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello John welcome |pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb: a slam. should not be hard to bid: the problem, I think, will be to avoid seven on power|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jallerton: Your commentators are Ian Crorie, Cliff Gillis, Sarah Teshome and myself.|pg||
nt|viren169: Much easier route to 4@H now|pg||
nt|viren169: assuming 2@C was majs|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Morning John, Peter and Gad|pg||
nt|jcomyn: an ouch already|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: NS are playing 15-17 NT, 5 card majors, 3 card minors|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good contract but...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jallerton: England have brought in a new pair.  Catherine Seale (West ) is playing her first Lady Milne|pg||
nt|pkl: Why 2@D if 2@C was majors? I believe 2@C must be something else.|pg||
nt|pkl: Morning Roland|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like they all have something to say here...|pg||
nt|sybarra: I had just said not a success, but could it be done?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this will test N in a big way|pg||
pc|hA|nt|viren169: Hearts coming into the picture now...|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|pkl: After a club to the ace and switch to diamonds, declarer might well fail.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning Roland|pg||
nt|pkl: But 5@C is a very cheap save|pg||
nt|viren169: North is likely to switch to the J of @S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|tihas: hi all|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|sybarra: oops |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|sybarra: now down  |pg||
pc|cA|nt|capercliff: 11h is not so easy|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jcomyn: well that solves the defence|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tihas: so this is the last match in the championship, and 4 teams are rather close at the end of round robin|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lively start anyway|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... -2 for a (probable) par result! |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcomyn: the 2H overcall should warn her|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: Monte Carlo had a good win in the last round.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Aivar Tihane from Estonia|pg||
nt|capercliff: 1@h|pg||
pc|c8|nt|chick: even 1 isn't :)|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|capercliff: lol|pg||
nt|capercliff: should be ok though|pg||
nt|capercliff: cant give up 3 trump tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pkl: Perhaps only down one, viren?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tihas: un summary, monte carlo has a 13.5 VP lead over Druva, so for Druva to have a chance for the gold they must win at least 22-8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @CK is (almost certainly) marked, so draw trumps and play a club towards the queen - may be a problem if trumps 3-1 and clubs 5-1|pg||
pc|d3|nt|viren169: Looks like all the players are keen to make their mark early in the match!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely this is a CRTFH hand|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|pkl: Pender hoping for more clubs at East. This was not to be|pg||
nt|sybarra: except that...short in hts and not much esle to ruff |pg||
pc|dT|nt|tihas: then there is another match, where Roheline Lammas plays Ekspromt, and the former has basically the same number of VP as Druva|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jcomyn: one down could be a good start for wales|pg||
nt|sybarra: *else|pg||
pc|dA|nt|idc: not sure I liked that 2nd round of @h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: true I suppose|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|chick: too late now|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d2|nt|henryb: drawing trumps does not look right, although not fatal on this layout|pg||
nt|jallerton: W has control now|pg||
nt|chick: nor I, no reason not to repeat the finesse missing that many trumps|pg||
nt|capercliff: down now|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d4|nt|idc: seemed to stake everything on 3-3 hearts when there was no rush to commit yourself|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d9|nt|jcomyn: ruff hgh and then low|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|idc: hmmm, even 3-3 @h might not have been enough|pg||
nt|capercliff: @s was best after first @h|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|hJ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcomyn: now d guess|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: think we might be making this one now |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: two rounds ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: nicely done |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jcomyn: thats well done|pg||

nt|capercliff: so 3-3 @h was unlickly|pg||
nt|jcomyn: great to see clubs come into their own at last|pg||
nt|pkl: I've heard that winning the Lady Milne Cup is almost as important to the Irish as winning the six nations, but that might be overdoing it|pg||
nt|pkl: Will East open? Would you guys?|pg||
nt|viren169: just a bit!|pg||
nt|sybarra: this spade suit would be easier to play :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|capercliff: unlikely even|pg||
nt|thegarve:  hi all|pg||
nt|capercliff: hey Martin|pg||
nt|jallerton: Welcome to Martin Garvey (England)|pg||
nt|idc: I was remionded of some dates I've been on years ago|pg||
nt|viren169: No|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sure is, but Ireland will NOT be winning the Lady Milne|pg||
nt|pkl: Do you have the standings, Bjorling?|pg||
nt|viren169: Bal'd 11 counts are looking for swings!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|pkl: Pass - really must be a question of style|pg||
nt|viren169: The Hackett boys would have opened East's hand in their sleep!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Northern Ireland 1, Scotland 2, Ireland 3, Ireland B 4 England 5  Wales 6|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|idc: some of them were unlickly too :)|pg||
nt|thegarve:  evening Cliff Jeffrey and Ian|pg||
mb|2C|nt|tihas: S aggressive opening bid mught get NS to 3NT|pg||
nt|tihas: which actually makes on a low spade lead|pg||
nt|capercliff: 41s is a practical bid here|pg||
nt|jallerton: can N avoid partner's suit?|pg||
nt|jallerton: well done|pg||
nt|capercliff: Scots better cash their tricks|pg||
nt|idc: hi Martin|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|thegarve:  missed the first set and it looks to be  a close match|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I would open the E hand if I were dead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a real crunchy 11 count Not Vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Intersting this 2@C bid... seems like it can be used for any hand!|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but off on a heart lead - all up to East now|pg||
nt|tihas: so rather fortunate 11 imps for Monte carlo|pg||
nt|viren169: Do we know what 2@C is? single suiter?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: D or both majors I imagine|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure where we are going here |pg||
nt|jcomyn: neither are they|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: ante|pg||
nt|viren169: Makes sense now...|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|sybarra: this might be best |pg||
pc|s6|nt|pkl: Could 2@C be four spades and another?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jcomyn: dont think so, they play ante|pg||
nt|sybarra: sp taps and what does W do? |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|idc: Ace is for reverse attitude, so they should cash out|pg||
nt|capercliff: udca|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|sybarra: here |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|idc: wild boards in 1st half, lots of slams|pg||
nt|sybarra: here is tap  1 |pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: can knock out @DA for nine tricks |pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: as spades are 4-3 |pg||
nt|viren169: I guess we will have to wait until next hand to know for sure...|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|pkl: Ah - sorry. Did stare a bit at that word. I don't know that convention ;-)|pg||
nt|viren169: Nice defence...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ante is 2C=D or both majors; 2D= H or S and a aminor; 2H H and a minor ; 2S=S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes the trump attack is good and works well|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|idc: in one with perfect fits and 3 grand slams available for NS, england reached game & scotland 4@d :)|pg||

nt|capercliff: 1N?|pg||
nt|viren169: Good hands for opening weak NT|pg||
nt|pkl: It looks like the limit is 2@S EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt n/s?  have she handle it?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tihas: otherwise it would have been very dangerous play|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2S|nt|capercliff: 2@h will need a bit of luck|pg||
nt|pkl: Kelly knew that ;-)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: notice that excellent hand to start was a mere 2S in open room - jeepers|pg||
nt|viren169: Now North may roll back in with a dble...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: WHACK|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
mb|d|nt|thegarve:  East will protect with a double|pg||
nt|viren169: and E/W will take the push to 3@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: just about to suggest the same thing|pg||
nt|idc: it isn't mandatory at teams, but just about worth it I think|pg||
nt|jallerton: giving W a decision|pg||
nt|capercliff: 2@s will need even more luck|pg||
nt|capercliff: I cant imagine W floating it|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and they mat even play in the 33 @s fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|tihas: it would be tempting to pass on 2@s with E hand|pg||
nt|tihas: but you have to be fairly certain that partner would balance also with 6 hcp|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East goes for the vulnerable game - might even have bid 3NT |pg||
nt|jallerton: in which case East did well to pass out 2@h|pg||
nt|idc: 3-3 fits are good for you, they often play quite well|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like Knight got their 1st!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and interesting hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: even I wouldnt bid 2S on that rubbish|pg||
pc|c6|nt|idc: for one thing, the fdefenders rarely realize what's afoot|pg||
nt|capercliff: might make 2@h on this lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: I'd still prefer to defend 2@h that play in the concealed 3-3 fit vulnerable|pg||
nt|thegarve:  the 33 fit often plays rather well|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes because you normally have a 9-card side suit:)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: South might have led the @SJ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|viren169: dble by S is a bit risky with West still unlimited|pg||
nt|viren169: and only 3 hearts|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|viren169: Cant see any line to make this...|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is a trick she didnt have |pg||
nt|jcomyn: and a really bad lead|pg||
pc|h8|nt|tihas: the 2@s opening actually got NS out of the trouble with bad @h break|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: partner's suit, and all that|pg||
nt|tihas: they probably would have arrived in 4@h if left to their own devices|pg||
nt|henryb: gee. I would get to 2@h|pg||
nt|tihas: 2@s opening promised a minor, too, so the logical thing would be to look for this minor|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|pkl: So any possiblility to win 3@S? There's no legit way, but could Pender perform some kind of magic? I dont believe so|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|henryb: 1@c-1@d-1@s-1NT-2@h all pass|pg||

nt|jallerton: Your commentators are Ian Crorie, Martin Garvey and Sarah Teshome|pg||

nt|idc: the garve is late, as usual :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/lmteams.htm for system cards|pg||
nt|idc: I'm afraid we don't have published systems for the English team, so we'll either need to guess|pg||
nt|steshome: A slam to start with!|pg||
nt|jallerton: or some of them anyway|pg||
nt|idc: or use the encyclopedic knowledge of Sarah and Jeffrey |pg||
nt|viren169: Now a great hand...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4H  normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: wow, grandy time|pg||
nt|henryb: 13 on top with no finesses|pg||
nt|mdgraham: always interesting to see how pairs cope with this kind of deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: 2@d Multi|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and a c lead to cause problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|pkl: Yes - 4@H looks like a nice contract. And no problems with both majors behaving|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@D would have made it difficult for Kelly!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that got what it deserved|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: Due to normal first round start-up glitches, we've missed a few boards, but with luck|pg||
nt|jallerton: I believe that EW play 5-card majors, strong NT, possibly also 2@d opener 18-19 balanced.|pg||
nt|capercliff: do they have more than one way to show? If not 2@h is pretty tame|pg||
nt|thegarve:  looks a bit too defensive and no ruffing value for a vul 2S|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3NT is the best chance of game EW|pg||
nt|idc: East hand is borderline try I guess - playing with me it's not but lots of vul weak twos will give play for game|pg||
nt|thegarve:  2NT hre surely?|pg||
nt|capercliff: I would have thought|pg||
nt|jallerton: I think they may be playing 2 ranges of weak 2|pg||
nt|jallerton: this being the weaker variety|pg||
nt|capercliff: so this is the rubbish one?|pg||
nt|pkl: You are contemplating the fourth club by N? Will it cause problems?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well I cant see anyway S will lead a C|pg||
pc|hK|nt|idc: East's minors don't make 4M look attractive but 3NT is a possibility|pg||

nt|capercliff: is there any hurry?|pg||
nt|idc: well, one way to try for -2 is cash out then @s ruff & discard|pg||
nt|capercliff: partner has to have something to open 2@d, if not a lot|pg||
nt|idc: declarer's trump position starts to look fragile - though as the cards lie she should escape ok|pg||
nt|thegarve:  people get worried in a doubled contracr and like to see the finishing line|pg||

mb|p|nt|idc: we'll be able to catch up on the results of them later (open the Movie box at the bottom right)|pg||
nt|pkl: I'd pass - also if the K was in clubs|pg||
nt|petepunt: a weak 2@S or not ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not for me |pg||
mb|2S|nt|thegarve:  2 by 2s|pg||
nt|idc: to follow the two by two I mean|pg||
nt|viren169: More difficult if North had opened...|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
nt|jcomyn: no not headed by J|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and W will take off|pg||
nt|sybarra: its not even as if the suit is solid to the J |pg||
mb|d|nt|petepunt: fav vul,  1st or3rd.  but still tempted in 2nd|pg||
mb|3S|nt|tihas: still, N had described balanced hand and driven to slam, so there was a case of adding one more for the road, because S actually hadnt shown a lot in the bidding|pg||
nt|tihas: but its tough at the table to do so|pg||
nt|henryb: 1@d = less than 16 points, no 5 card or longer major|pg||
nt|tihas: I think N with balanced hand should have constrained to showing his values|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: strong NT|pg||
nt|viren169: Border line for me... |pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: NS play Acol, weak NT, Multi 2@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont criticize the bid, its just not my style |pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: too difficult - if partner jumps to the six-level, he should know what he is doing |pg||
nt|steshome: I thought E/W were playing a weak NT, but we might have a chance to find out soon|pg||
nt|jallerton: S had an interesting decision: pass, double, 3@h or 2NT|pg||
nt|idc: Fearless protecting at teams, vul v not|pg||
nt|petepunt: south had tough bids,  final pass seems about right|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcomyn: my sentiments - that leaves D out of it God gave us 12pts to open|pg||
nt|jcomyn: okay SK but 4-card H|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||

nt|jcomyn: thats what the 2S did - keep opps out of trouble|pg||

nt|jallerton: looks as though E is trying to put W in to get a ruff (or two if partner has @sK10x|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think 3 @S to keep n/s out of minor suit partial '|pg||
nt|petepunt: prob 9 tricks|pg||

nt|capercliff: prob some sort of Ogust|pg||
nt|thegarve:  what range is 2@D majors?|pg||
nt|viren169: Now N/S|pg||

mb|p|nt|jallerton: would you double as West?|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes I would|pg||
nt|thegarve:  3@h is pre-empting yourself|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5-9|pg||
nt|viren169: Pass?!?!|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|idc: If 1@c could be 11-13 bal, probably not|pg||
nt|jallerton: No, sorry to mislead you earlier, 1@c was natural or 15-17 balanced|pg||
nt|idc: but since that isn't what they play, i probably would|pg||
nt|steshome: Is that lead right?|pg||
nt|capercliff: ive never understood playing 1N natural here, but I suppose these days opp open and respond with anything|pg||
nt|capercliff: and N certainly has @h stopped|pg||
nt|thegarve:  as East was a passed hand|pg||
nt|pkl: Ouch. |pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: 1n 15-17, 2@C c/b|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: West consults system file for "Interference over Blackwood" section |pg||
nt|jallerton: It's a logical lead; E thinks that declarer has @cJxxx and partner may have a singleton|pg||
nt|idc: A lot like to play 2H natural there, so that would be an option|pg||
mb|p|nt|tihas: in desperate times like these, E might actually consider bidding 7@h all by himself after partner launches blackwood|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes reasonable shot|pg||
nt|capercliff: could it hurt to get count in @c first?|pg||
nt|jallerton: not a great success here, however.  I think a top club would be found by most people (rightly or wrongly)|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes I agree|pg||
nt|capercliff: good lead for the defence|pg||
nt|petepunt: may have upgraded S to 18-19 an drebid 2n|pg||
mb|3N|nt|capercliff: good thing declarer doesnt have 7 top tricks now|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, Cliff, is partner has a singleton club|pg||
nt|viren169: Wales are giving Eire a ahead strart before they get going... |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 6@H+1 may be EW's best result. NS likely to save over a seven bid|pg||
nt|jallerton: she can finesse in @H|pg||
nt|capercliff: but will still roll home with 3-2@h and 3-3@s|pg||

nt|petepunt: suits dont break well|pg||

nt|thegarve:  East cannot get West in to play the pressure low @d|pg||

nt|idc: Awful defence - @dT lead, declarer didn't duck, so they got their ruff|pg||

pc|h9|nt|henryb: the problem with the nebuloud @d is that N cannot be sure that S has @d|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N makes me wonder if north's sequence is stronger than it looks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: aggressive 3NT|pg||
nt|capercliff: if 2@c was a transfer, did it have a lower limit?|pg||
nt|capercliff: must have|pg||
nt|jallerton: that could be the case here; passing an unlimited transfer on W ould be dangerous|pg||
nt|idc: I'm no expert on xfer rebids - is 2@c better than 2NT say with that East hand?|pg||
nt|idc: not that game is rigid, but a @d lead from North is a strong possibility|pg||

nt|thegarve:  in recent times England have had many new players or partneships playing|pg||

nt|capercliff: I was thinking 41s myself|pg||
nt|capercliff: @s|pg||
nt|jallerton: What's your idea of a bad game, Cliff?|pg||
nt|idc: agree Sarah - it might look daring but much less dangerous than some of the protective bids they *have* been making|pg||
nt|idc: and a much bigger potential upside|pg||
nt|steshome: I see that Fiona gained 4 for passing the transfer on the previous board|pg||
nt|capercliff: well we can see all hands, after 1@h the K@d has a good chance of being right|pg||
nt|capercliff: also 2-2 @s not unreasonable|pg||
nt|jallerton: but you need both and even then need to get a trick out of clubs|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh dear thats poor|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|idc: I was wondering - if North becomes declarer in 4@s, does West have 13 penalty cards?|pg||
nt|jallerton: interesting TD call.  Did the sight of @sQ10x in West stop North from saving in 4@S?|pg||
nt|capercliff: this doesnt play very well|pg||

nt|othered1: Not sure what the auction meant, but contract is normal and good.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possibly 3@H=clubs|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|idc: The only chance is if North forgets she isn't playing v men and leans forward too much and exposes her hand|pg||
nt|capercliff: as it happens a @h lead and @s shift is better|pg||
nt|steshome: England gaining 11 on the previous board when the Scots fail to beat 4@h|pg||
nt|thegarve:  T@s and then when playing a @D toward dummy duck the card from South|pg||

nt|capercliff: squeeze for 12 tricks here?|pg||
nt|idc: I watched N Ireland bid this at the start of the session|pg||
nt|jallerton: 6NT can be made on a strip squeeze here|pg||
nt|idc: Caira Burns did indeed make 6NT on a @c lead by that method|pg||
nt|jallerton: 6@C is better but hard to reach I suspect|pg||
nt|steshome: And on other lines.  Mind you 6@c is easier|pg||
nt|idc: not sure it was best % line but can't argue with success|pg||
nt|steshome: Oh well.  |pg||
nt|pkl: 4@H anyone?|pg||
nt|viren169: Pender may make it difficult for North|pg||
nt|viren169: but may get caught in the process!|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: Hi Mike|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzme: This is the final round. So far the standings are: Monte Carlo (356), Roheline Lammas (343), Druva (342,5), Eksprompt (338), Rakvere (313), Derpt (249), Otepää (222), Pärnu BK3 ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzme: (201).|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Your commentators for this match are Henry Bethe and Ed Shapiro (USA). I am Mike Graham (England).  |pg||
nt|idc: My theory: if you are gong to bother looking for a 4-4 @s fit with the North hand|pg||
nt|steshome: Still up though ...|pg||
nt|viren169: I think 3@C is enough with that hand...|pg||
mb|1N|nt|capercliff: weak NT might be a success on this deal|pg||
nt|jcomyn: danger of bidding a game they might not bid otherwise|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: they are going to 6|pg||
nt|idc: and most would, how can it not be even better to look for a @c fit too?|pg||
nt|viren169: too many doubletons for me...|pg||
nt|viren169: Now is that values or take-out?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now 3NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what can she be thinking about|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mdgraham: Our operaor is Raul Laasner (Estonia). |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|vugraphzme: welcome everyone|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@s vul vs not is braver than I would be|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South knew what to expect, though |pg||
mb|2D|nt|capercliff: 3N from S is never getting a @c lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: well done|pg||
nt|capercliff: 6@c is a fine bid|pg||
nt|steshome: I don't know why 6@c is difficult to reach|pg||
nt|capercliff: now just to make it|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2NT 3-card raise again|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jallerton: 12 imps coming to Scotland|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like take-out|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: and 41s requires declarer to get everything right|pg||
nt|capercliff: @s|pg||
nt|viren169: and West survives to tell the tale...|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: West neatly (and rightly) avoided a 2-suited overcall.|pg||
nt|jallerton: that looks like the best lead|pg||
nt|thegarve:  can't be 4th highest from honour|pg||
nt|capercliff: I suspect this will drift 1 off|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes it's a good lead.|pg||
nt|capercliff: hoping my usual predictions are wrong of course:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  so if rising has chances|pg||
nt|petepunt: ineresting play hand|pg||
pc|h5|nt|petepunt: need to play q@h so that...|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|steshome: How did England miss this in the open room?  |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jcomyn: ok folks last haned coming up. Thanks once again to Paul Porteus and the CBAI for arranging this event. Eamonn Galligan in gizmo and my co-commentators, Shirley Ybarra and Peter ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Goodman. Lively stuff and good hands|pg||
nt|petepunt: ... that u can then hold up @H|pg||
pc|c2|nt|thegarve:  its from xxx so no trump lead suggests qxx @s|pg||
pc|cT|nt|henryb: I wonder whether a less brave call, such as pass, would have led to E-W missing this game|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|capercliff: not necessarily Martin|pg||
nt|steshome: If you say so|pg||
nt|viren169: all routes lead to 10 tricks... on hooking the @H|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but didnt|pg||
nt|petepunt: a let off|pg||
nt|jcomyn: too true|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d2|pc|h2|nt|jallerton: depends on the opening lead style of this particular West|pg||
nt|thegarve:  when in two-way Q situations build up your clues|pg||
nt|capercliff: this auction doesnt call for a @s lead anyway|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|jcomyn: phew|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another slap on the hand for my wife|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||

nt|jallerton: Finally thanks to BBO and a special thank you to Roland Wald for all his hard work. |pg||
nt|steshome: Yes thanks to all especially Roland|pg||
nt|thegarve:  big swings appearing on both sides of the fence 14 on board 29 and 13 on board 31|pg||
nt|capercliff: Scotland will need a small swing on this brd to win|pg||
mb|1S|nt|idc: Looks like a normal 3NT making, so Scotland will be taking a small lead into the second half|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@D is not exactly holding back at this vulnerability  |pg||
nt|jallerton: S has an awkward call here|pg||
nt|idc: wow - Guy got the @d right in 3NT on Board 29 - a surprise 14 IMPs for Scotland|pg||
nt|jallerton: I like 1@s|pg||
nt|pkl: Yes - two dubious actions in open room: the invitation and the acceptance to game.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk4: 20 rather, 9:55 local time|pg||
nt|petepunt: thanks all - hope ive said enough nice things they let me back into ireland next weak?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Sarah, Jeffrey and Ian will be back, so you are in good company, specs|pg||
nt|idc: that was the AQx opposite Txxxx - she played A then led up to Qx & ducked|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  North opened the bidding on baord 29|pg||
mb|3S|nt|idc: all four pairs seemed a bit rusty so far, but now they'll be warmed up|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes 1@s looks rather obvious no?|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes I saw - very good view|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like 2@S will make but imps flowing in the opposite direction...|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|henryb: I think the Estonians take the view: I paid my card fees and I did not pay them to pass!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: except that two of the 'warmed up' pairs may be asked to sit out!|pg||
nt|capercliff: not much to this hand, a quick claim after 2 rounds of @c|pg||
nt|jallerton: teams of 6|pg||
