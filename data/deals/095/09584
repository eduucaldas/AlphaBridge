nt|viren169: brb coffee time here|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont worry about it its early in the day for bridge players|pg||
nt|lestergold: ive just finished breakfast|pg||
nt|jbgood: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: coffe break hand? easy 3n for e/w?|pg||
nt|daman: 4 boards to go and a very tight match|pg||
nt|daman: crazy result on this hand in the other room|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT  -5|pg||
nt|garnetts: If I were East I would like to find a hole to crawl into--but then again it is better to make mistakes when it is of little importance|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|olson: w could have  been   3226 with Kx of H and south now  sets the hand     |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this is a trappy hand|pg||
nt|olson: he knows a spade back makes  3n  |pg||
nt|garnetts: case for 3NT here as South|pg||
nt|garnetts: Or even 1NT|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|jbgood: y |pg||
nt|lestergold: well a disaster for e/w in closed on a spade lead against 3n hard to play the ten and block the suit|pg||
nt|daman: spade wasn't led|pg||
nt|ppilot: 1 seems possible:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: In the good old days this would have been passed out.|pg||
nt|thegarve:  many woukd do the same bidding 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: no trumps played by east will produce a big swing|pg||
nt|olson: 110 for  ew  |pg||
nt|roswolf: this hand may blow up in someone's face|pg||
nt|olson: n  could play  3c  when south  reopens  over  2s|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: so waht happened George |pg||
nt|thegarve:  but declarer played j@d at trick 2 - thus going off|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5h 3 dims and a club adds to nine|pg||
nt|ppilot: this will get them at 4 spades may be?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: guess another spade before hearts would've worked|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL by N is aggressive|pg||
nt|mariner1: possibly meaning long @c here?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Must mean that; else I see no justification for x.|pg||
nt|garnetts: slow pass makes it hard for East|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: i see odd play in open room|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeeed|pg||
nt|garnetts: Maybe there could be a ruling asked for here|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would reopen but not if partner thought first |pg||
nt|ppilot: may be they are doing it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: Danailov is thinking|pg||
nt|garnetts: any possibility of a slow pass being queried?|pg||
nt|ppilot: if he bids only 3 his partner will kill him:)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: why on earth would anyone do that|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: can anyone X?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: D Q 6 blacks, DA-D|pg||
nt|thegarve:  pressure|pg||
nt|olson: depends  if  N  has  2n  availa ble as a scramble  bid  after  second  double|pg||
nt|olson: always  lucky when  N guesses the 4 card suit to bid  that south has  4 of :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well n/s may survive this contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|garnetts: I would too :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|tweety1: this will hurt EW a bit|pg||
nt|mariner1: well the DBL certainly seems to be working here|pg||
nt|ppilot: unfortunately hard to find diamond lead to make this game hard here|pg||
nt|viren169: b|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think that 1NT by South would have bought the contract |pg||
pc|c6|nt|daman: compression pressure|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they m ay simply cash the first 7 tricks here|pg||
nt|daman: Played the @D J to protect his @S holding and it blew up in his face|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mmmakela: made now|pg||
nt|sybarra: if defending like that better not X |pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: a little break|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if something can go wrong for W it has happened during this match, poor guy|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I gotta go too, ty all and have a nice weekend!|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have all been there (or at least I have) |pg||
nt|daman: might happen here too   but not down as many|pg||
nt|lestergold: need a very long neck to get this rite|pg||
nt|lestergold: and an ability to see thru screens to x ray vision|pg||
nt|daman: a peek is worth 2 finesses|pg||
nt|thegarve:  rubbedr necks do help|pg||
nt|olson: this can be set  if defenders  lead  clubs  after  spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: will south resist temptation?|pg||
nt|olson: he should  |pg||
pc|s8|nt|rado: at other room W played 4@H but again no @D lead and easy 11 tricks claiemd after @S lead|pg||
nt|olson: only 6 winners   and  4d  takes  10 tricks  to get a plus score|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|olson: plus he  expects  3s  is going  down  |pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: just because of the heart break|pg||
pc|s2|nt|daman: curtains|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jbgood: must be some special treatment of puppet |pg||
pc|h4|nt|tweety1: dbl is single suiter |pg||
nt|mariner1: so they play something like DONT over the 1N forcing|pg||
nt|tweety1: yep|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yep, seems like it.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|viren169: good duck|pg||
nt|thegarve:  in theold days the wisened pro used the cigarette and drink trick|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jbgood: 3@h usually shows a five card suit |pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: and not much of a swing|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|daman: will only lose 2   they will be relieved |pg||
nt|thegarve:  cigareete on table to the left and drink  on the table to the right - so coukd lean over botyh sides |pg||
pc|cA|nt|viren169: Now @D|pg||
nt|viren169: but still 10 tricks...|pg||
nt|ppilot: yes ace adn new diamond |pg||
nt|viren169: all routes end in 10/11 tricks for declarer...|pg||
nt|viren169: probably best to exit with the trump...|pg||
nt|ppilot: then 11 taking safe side spade fin|pg||
nt|viren169: true...|pg||
nt|rado: every imp might be precious since the results among first 4 teams stand for next stage of the finals|pg||
nt|lestergold: three off intead of five off only fifities|pg||
nt|daman: 2 IMPs apart with 3 to go in this set|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mariner1: eventually someone will try @c|pg||
nt|tweety1: actually i didnt like E's 1 @h here.|pg||
nt|ppilot: 11 now|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
pc|s4|nt|danilo1: Scan see 10 to 11 tricks, depending on @S guess ... actually 11 trick as safety is to keep south aut of lead , also after @D and @D (N does not have trump exit too|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tweety1: @s|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S sure seems obvious|pg||
pc|c5|nt|tweety1: W will be squezed soon|pg||
nt|tweety1: if ducks @s now|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Then it is 3 down.|pg||
nt|mariner1: if he ducks he gets no more tricks|pg||
nt|tweety1: he wont duck|pg||
nt|tweety1: anyone bets?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he is certainly considering it|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jbgood: now a double squeeze for 11|pg||
pc|s7|nt|tweety1: he knows every count and distr|pg||
pc|dT|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|vugraphzkv: smoking break|pg||
nt|olson: I need to run   thx  all   need some sleep  :)   |pg||

mb|1D|nt|benislovas: 10 imps again|pg||
nt|benislovas: Pretendentas has bid that and made doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|benislovas: 6@C playable from E hand|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|sfoxa:  but really hard to find|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  heart lead?|pg||
nt|benislovas: J@s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not necessary - diamond works as well|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|benislovas: yes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and spade too|pg||
nt|benislovas: E has things to think about|pg||
nt|benislovas: specially if he feels that has to fight back|pg||
mb|p|nt|benislovas: 6nt from E also makeable|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  only in such circumstances, yes|pg||
nt|benislovas: very hard pass as i saw|pg||
nt|benislovas: with a lot of hesitations|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mariner1: someone could get shoved too high here.........|pg||
nt|ppilot: interesting board|pg||
nt|thegarve:  at the bar last weekend - Mike asked for a pint of leffee beer - they wouldn't sreve them in pints (too strong) so David asked for two halves on his beahlf ...the staff looked confused|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is surely weak!|pg||
nt|roswolf: but n/s should still bid to 4@S|pg||
nt|garnetts: That is a rank overcall at red|pg||
nt|ppilot: 4 spade looks makeble but with very careful play|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|mariner1: S passing my stop that from happening|pg||
nt|mariner1: may|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably game forcing|pg||
nt|garnetts: flat 11 count--yuck |pg||
nt|garnetts: likely to get 4@H now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@C precision style 5+ clubs|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ppilot: another light opening we have lot bidders here|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting how E/W were able to play 3@D after a strong 1@C opening...|pg||
nt|lestergold: well after the recent excitement we can have a coffee/ beer for martin break+|pg||
nt|daman: this will be a flat hand    |pg||
nt|garnetts: AS specs are asking what should South do--one word --PASS|pg||
nt|ppilot: i will pass too but here they try to kill each other|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: is this the final segment or?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D showing @H? or @D and @H?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 2@d is transfer to @h.|pg||
nt|roswolf: north must feel like bidding and has struck oil|pg||
nt|roswolf: now north must resist going on|pg||
mb|3C|nt|viren169: in the other room|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4@h goes down on a club ruff - but no ruffs in 3 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well so much for shoving by anyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: eggsacterly|pg||
nt|garnetts: It looks mostly like suicide so far |pg||
nt|ppilot: this can be made too:)|pg||
nt|ppilot: if club lead|pg||
nt|ppilot: let us see if karakolev passes:)|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  alcohol free zone today|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes of course Martin|pg||
nt|lestergold: whatever|pg||
nt|thegarve:  honest guv|pg||
nt|thegarve:  been in worse slam than this|pg||
nt|daman: West won't reach opposite a passed hand I would think|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland would be in this for sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: which is routine really|pg||
mb|4D|nt|tweety1: south is walking at the edge of cliff:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: wronghanded now |pg||
nt|thegarve:  4@c cue seems in order|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: no blood|pg||
nt|daman: Roland would be in 7|pg||
nt|lestergold: and so may they!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: and theyll make it too|pg||
nt|ppilot: lool|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: south wont be too happy until he finds out the club position|pg||
nt|ppilot: it looks like boxing :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well I would employ the duck and jettison coup here---East should duck when West throws his cards at him|pg||
nt|ppilot: why pass at 4 clubs doubled when you can play 5 doubled???|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: saved by E |pg||
nt|lestergold: doesnt look sadly if there is any legit play for 3n now|pg||
nt|jbgood: pity S didnt bid 2 @s - then a chance of N being declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: with 4 spades to q, south may have felt that it was his place to bid the no trumps- its not unreasonable|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it would be a match winner now|pg||
mb|4S|nt|danilo1: @H lead beats 4@S ... sa oftern, West opening bid is mal-treatment of system|pg||
nt|viren169: probaly die out in 3@H|pg||
nt|ppilot: 4 has a play but on open kards|pg||
nt|lestergold: hes going Martin|pg||
nt|thegarve:  rkb it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: 2 @dx cld be  -2 on 'c lead= 500 EW|pg||
nt|starkist: easy double|pg||
mb|4N|nt|danilo1: not only , but indicated to play @CQ ... for 10 Dble |pg||
nt|ppilot: what a struggle for 2 imps|pg||
nt|jbgood: but S might have bid NT next time if prd doesnt over 2@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: :) now he is happy|pg||
nt|roswolf: well what is he thinking about?|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: East isn't supposed to have the hand he has    they are supposed to open with any 11 and he didn't    sooooo trying for a salami doesn't wash with me|pg||
nt|lestergold: yeh excitment no coffe break after all|pg||
nt|lestergold: no more silly predicitons todaty|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||
nt|thegarve:  now its find the q@d on a @c lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim is to way but hell do it the simple conveneient way|pg||
mb|5C|nt|daman: Forquet said that was his lifelong dilemma    finding a missing Queen|pg||
nt|thegarve:  J@S leadwould suggest an honour in each suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: belladonna had no problem- u know the story about thyem putting th queen in both hands|pg||
nt|daman: no|pg||
nt|daman: but I.m sure you will tell us|pg||
nt|lestergold: he said it was impossible theyu both had the missing queen he knew it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ppilot: 3 di dobled was down 2 on trump promotions|pg||
nt|garnetts: I hope there are no potential weapons like an ashtray near by |pg||
nt|ppilot: come on ilko diamonds:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: or guns or swords?|pg||
nt|garnetts: well there are pointed suits...............|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: (oops sorry)  but "we" thought they did well to beat 3 @C |pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: all this is true but i think 2n was a naturakl enuf bid|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|viren169: tough for South to pass...|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|thegarve:  both discrding from length|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: east has to find 3 discards of course|pg||
nt|garnetts: I suppose the defence was the same |pg||
nt|sybarra: somewhat similar yes |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|thegarve:  clues about q@d|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h3|nt|tweety1: NS is playing a sort of transfering system on overcalls.  The transfer everything:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: and west too|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|viren169: West playing pd for QT of @Cs|pg||
nt|ppilot: 170 now|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mariner1: yes S convative yet reasonable pass and W's 2@C call slowed this down both ways|pg||
pc|c7|nt|thegarve:  pressure told|pg||
nt|daman: will make this now|pg||
nt|lestergold: all room for clever stuff now out of the window|pg||
nt|daman: the defenders needed to cooperate     didn't happen|pg||
nt|thegarve:  this is a good example of why you do not make a passive lead versus a slam where declarer has a long suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: west will be thinking on the discards that the dim q is wrong and will breath the bighgest sigh of relief of all time when the q shows up|pg||
pc|c6|nt|thegarve:  Ireland 22 Scotland 15 9 mins to go in the rugby|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: only three dims left with the defenders now!!!|pg||
nt|garnetts: Is East running?  |pg||
pc|cT|pc|d3|pc|c8|nt|lestergold: well nothing exciting has hjappened|pg||

nt|mariner1: conservative|pg||
nt|baldfriede: strong hand*|pg||
nt|viren169: well deserved 3 imps!|pg||
nt|danilo1: has been allways 170 (or 620) ... actuallly, EW lucky that South had 4 Hcp in wrong suits ... so did not jump to 4|pg||
nt|skorchev: on a 20 board match, 18 imps difference converts to 19-11 VPs|pg||
nt|lestergold: no allowed declarer a cake walk|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very slow one admittedly|pg||
nt|daman: oh well   fortune favo(u)rs the bold    and the bold just picked up 11IMPs to take the lead with 2 boards to go |pg||
nt|ppilot: no he always blame his partners|pg||
nt|ppilot: he now i suppose explain as 2 way double pass or stay:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I understand that--but there are times when you should make an effort to ensure personal safety |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|lestergold: well this board aint gonna reverse that lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have no doubt that partner should pass--in which case he clearly would not save|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: the weak NT in Open worked well here|pg||
nt|viren169: E/W could get into trouble now...|pg||
nt|jbgood: This is the penultimate board in this room, and I want to thank the Bulgarian Bridge Federation and Stan Nedkov for letting us watch these interesting team matches. |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: with west opting to upgrade his hand to a 1 club opener e/w may well reach a very thin 3n which may hVAVE CHANCES|pg||
nt|jbgood: And a big hand to our excellent operator, well done Silvia Isaeva!|pg||
nt|ppilot: hope atleast one flat board?|pg||
nt|garnetts: This does not play that easily |pg||
mb|3H|nt|ppilot: let us see if they reduce or increase 2 boards left|pg||
nt|viren169: east pass by N|pg||
nt|lestergold: didnt mean to press capitals|pg||
nt|lestergold: however n/s have offered an alternative source of points also offered in closed room but accepted here|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: also thnk you Mike Gold, England, for devoting time to guide us through these hands:)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mariner1: 1@H probably used as catch all not promising @H though no alert|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: East will be happy until he sees dummy!|pg||
nt|lestergold: well east ahsnt accepted it|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: S will play 1 nt dbled|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a straightforward auction but the play might not be so straightforward|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a guaranteed swing in one or other direction now|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like 2 hearts a dim and two spades for the defence|pg||
pc|s4|nt|tweety1: Thank God nobody bet:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: unavoidable on this lead must go off|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jbgood: also tu BBO and Roland Wald for providing software and organizing live broadcasts for the enire world to enjoy!|pg||
nt|lestergold: double now will increrase thec kleasd|pg||
nt|daman: I like DOPI for Kings over interference of my 2@C openers     that way we can catch the opps speeding from time to time and still get to our normal contract if we don't|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump switch now?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: or even pass|pg||
nt|thegarve:  time to tickle 3d|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bit over the top |pg||
nt|mariner1: W finds a lead right into the Jaws as it were|pg||
nt|lestergold: a few more in in any case|pg||
nt|lestergold: a tickle would have certainly been my choice|pg||
nt|sybarra: low @S  lead helped |pg||
pc|dA|nt|tweety1: thats why E shld have dbled, at least for @d lead|pg||
nt|danilo1: not tragedy ... will grabble 6-7 tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: There must be a temptation to take a spade finesse|pg||
nt|garnetts: that may not allow dec to take advantage of a favourable @D position |pg||
pc|d7|nt|mariner1: though a red suit lead would have been kinder to S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: EW probably think they are ahead and are just protecting their lead|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ppilot: if they find club ruff =500|pg||
nt|lestergold: here here!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim finesse followed by a lot of tricks cashing and a claim for one off|pg||
pc|dK|nt|viren169: -500 against part-score|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: fair ebuf George|pg||
nt|lestergold: i meant enuf|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|garnetts: crucial point here now |pg||
nt|garnetts: A heart is essential but which one?  |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: fair enuf|pg||
pc|s5|nt|viren169: a bit unlucky for E/W |pg||
nt|thegarve:  they wouldn't know that they are leading|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jbgood: Finally a big thank you to our kibs for their inputs - much appreciated! Hope you enjoyed|pg||
nt|daman: gotcha|pg||
nt|lestergold: they get a few imps for passing too|pg||
nt|daman: table presence tells you whether or not you think you are ahead in the match|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats also true Martin|pg||
nt|ppilot: small is the only chance|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|skorchev: 500=9 imps=17-13|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|sybarra: would it have been better to duck first ht in both hands?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|garnetts: will he actually run this ?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|lestergold: well maybe west wasnt 100 percent sure of beating 3d|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|viren169: no way to escape -2|pg||
nt|ppilot: again have to take my word no flat board|pg||
pc|h7|nt|daman: @DQ in dummy would have been a keen disappointment|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

nt|viren169: hear... hear...|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|vugraphzkv: See you after 45 min. for next match|pg||
mb|d|nt|thegarve:  its round robin teams so you need the occasional 21-9 win or more to offest the losses so give it a double|pg||

nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|daman: well...this has been fun folks   thanks Mike and Martin|pg||
nt|lestergold: they have to bid 6h which i dont think can actually make unofrtunately|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is the trouble with conventions when you have a very strong hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: south is now just going to have to guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: thx Silvia,  must be dinner time there |pg||

nt|lestergold: well theyhabvnt and no swing|pg||
nt|daman: and Bravo Silvia our very fine vugraph operator|pg||
nt|lestergold: the  3/1 ht brwak means they cant draw trumps establish all the spades in the end game they need to ruff the fifth spade and a dim in dummy but there would only be one trump left ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: to do it!!|pg||
