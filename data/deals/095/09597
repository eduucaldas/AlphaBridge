nt|Walddk7: Hi Martin, David and Nicoleta. Have fun!|pg||
mb|d|nt|finch: West feels pleased to have a 20-count, followed by worry at being fourth in hand|pg||
nt|shevek: hello everyone :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mcarroll: And a Multi opening to start|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the NS convention card misses the 2@d opening|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: Tobias, are they using screens?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: EW may easily get overboard here -- a trappy hand for them|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: no|pg||
nt|finch: with the opponents NV, you never get first crack in fourth seat|pg||
nt|Walddk8: 2@H, and then 3@H by Cilleborg is enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: W has a huge hand, and will probably support @Ss but the 5-1 split is merciless|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Hi Nicoleta|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W asking what N showed|pg||
nt|shevek: martin :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|xenya: NS are likely to end up in 3N here -- probably going down?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ty|pg||
nt|shevek: 1@d probable the "convenience diamond opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S: 1@d doesn't say anything about @d|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: with clubs 4-4 there are eight tricks - and where's there's eight...|pg||
nt|xenya: good lead, but anything would work here it seems|pg||
nt|Walddk8: I don't think the hand is good enough for 4|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jallerton: well the auction is a bit cramped, I can understand 4@h|pg||
nt|jallerton: some case for 2NT to show the values|pg||
nt|finch: if the @SQ were in diamonds I like 4@H more|pg||
nt|Walddk8: It's a 6-loser hand opposite a partner who was asked to bid on a zero count. Surely 4@H is too much|pg||
nt|jallerton: opposite @sJxx 3NT could be the only making game|pg||
nt|jallerton: should duck the lead|pg||
nt|finch: ..smoothly|pg||
nt|finch: see if you can tempt South to continue them|pg||
nt|Walddk8: If partner can't raise 3@H to game, you won't have missed anything|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

mb|1C|mb|2D|mb|3D|nt|thegarve:  danger of going overboard in @d|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|finch: hard to stay out of game here, although 3NT looks for most natural final contract|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   not a bad spot for e/w    -  but the diamond unkind   and a likely spade lead will beat it|pg||
nt|thegarve:  I expect 2@d was an Artificial GF|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|finch: Unusually for a ladies' pair, EW play 5card majors, strong NT|pg||
nt|thegarve:  now with doubt about @h stops - I expect to see 5@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: may not get a spade lead on this bidding, mind|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: personally sitting West I'd have more doubts about club stops|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|dburn: but South will probably not have much choice - hearts are going to be the unbid suit, but the singleton @hQ isn't really a candidate|pg||
nt|finch: 3NT is certainly a better spot that 5@D|pg||

nt|dburn: though I guess clubs might not be a "bid suit" in this auction - not sure how many of them East has promised|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|dburn: well, West has started bidding them|pg||
nt|finch: East has promised 3@C, although having denied diamond support probably should have 4 now|pg||
nt|finch: looks as if 4@C is a self-cue for diamonds.  Either that, or Gerber.|pg||
nt|dburn: exclusion keycard Gerber for diamonds, one assumes|pg||
nt|thegarve:  3NT off in the other room , I doubt if 5@d will be doubled|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d9|nt|dburn: five aces|pg||
nt|finch: 3NT went off after a spade lead, spade return, diamond to the jack ducked|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and a void|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|dburn: exclusing @cA, of course|pg||
nt|finch: EW are probably fortunate that everything else is going off |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|ady: the everything else can only be 3NT   and that might make with a defensive slip up|pg||
pc|s8|nt|xenya: i'm not sure EW have been on the same wavelength here|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|finch: South probably feels the need for slightly better diamonds to double.  It sounds as if the opponents are making slam tries|pg||
nt|dburn: they were doing OK until East raised what she thought were West's clubs|pg||
pc|d5|nt|thegarve:  the 5@c indicates that, but it is not an easy hand to bid|pg||
pc|s9|nt|xenya: yes, that's what i meant|pg||
nt|finch: I think West should pass 3NT.  She's had the chance to show a big hand with diamonds; 3NT must imply no interest in anything higher|pg||
nt|xenya: i totally agree|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe it was East's fault for not passing 2@d, which appeared to be her last chance for a plus score|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d7|nt|finch: I agree the risk is that East has e.g. Kxxx AKx Qx xxxx, but that is a 3@H bid over 3@D|pg||
nt|dburn: although I suppose she could also have passed 3@d|pg||
nt|dburn: or 1@d, come to that|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||

mb|1N!|an|11-14|nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|col3435: would have been in danger if the @d finesse was wrong - could take @d, @h, @c and a @h ruff|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|finch: That was a good hand for opening as South, otherwise she would have defended an opening 2NT making|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: this looks like a fairly straightforward 4@H for NS |pg||

nt|finch: unfortunately that's only 8.  I wonder if there's a ninth somewhere|pg||
nt|jallerton: E has time to switch to @c|pg||
nt|jallerton: but then W might be endplayed|pg||
nt|finch: I think declarer can make it double dummy by playing on spades, but it's natural to attack diamonds|pg||
nt|jallerton: as W's red cards will be stripped|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: W asked|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: or 5@h 4@s|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|finch: The 'obvious' line is to win the heart in hand and start on diamonds|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: probably @SK then @DQ|pg||
nt|jallerton: no can start with @d and switch to endplay line when @d turn out to be 4-1|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Seems so|pg||
nt|finch: that 9 of clubs is also a good card|pg||
nt|shevek: NS need to take a @c ruff...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|projekt1: Kriftner - Reim play Blue Club - 1 @C 17+, canape openers else, 1 NT 15-17|pg||
nt|projekt1: Jörg Fritsche, NPC of Germany sitting here too|pg||
nt|projekt1: 1@H was relay, 2@S showed 15-16 with 5+@S, 4+@D|pg||
nt|projekt1: club lead kills,  every other allows to make it|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|xenya: E has a choice betwwen @Cs and @Hs here -- seems N's 1@H was not natural |pg||
nt|projekt1: 1@H could be 11-12 balanced without @H, so the choice was between @C and @H|pg||
nt|xenya: and she has found it|pg||
nt|xenya: well done|pg||
nt|shevek: @c now|pg||
pc|d9|nt|finch: East has to duck the first diamond.  Looks very very silly if West has singleton @DK|pg||
pc|dK|nt|shevek: too late now|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|finch: On the second diamond it is tempting to duck to make communications more awkward|pg||
nt|finch: but against that East might be worried she'll never make it|pg||
pc|s4|nt|finch: with the clubs doubly stopped declarer can also make just by setting up diamonds|pg||
nt|jallerton: @c are not necessarily double stopped.  E could switch to @cJ from AJxx|pg||
nt|jallerton: and restricted choice and lack of @cJ lead might persuade declarer to play for that|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: now the defence should be easy|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|finch: declarer now will now worry about losing 2 spades 2 diamonds and a club if she sets up diamonds|pg||
pc|sK|nt|finch: so may now start on the spade suit, knocking out the K, 10|pg||
pc|s3|nt|finch: ... although possibly not having ducked the first spade|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mcarroll: True but it seems counter intuitive that the hand with a singleton trump is the threat of the vital ruff|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cashes @HAK just to avoid any nonsense|pg||
nt|shevek: north knew south didn't have @dsg or !K |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|finch: Jeffrey is confident declarer is going to make via an endplay.  I am worried she's going to try and endplay the wrong hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: East passed originally|pg||
nt|finch: Anyway, she can now go back to setting up diamonds... cash the heart discarding a spade and concede a diamond trick|pg||
nt|finch: the actual spade position looks quite plausible|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mcarroll: Still needs careful play|pg||
pc|hA|nt|shevek: anyway, easy when we see all hands|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jallerton: Did she need to play for @hJ to drop?|pg||
nt|finch: yes.  But the attitude lead should have given the heart position away.  |pg||
pc|cK|nt|finch: Unless the lead was from 832, but that looks an odd lead|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|shevek: lucky the short @c hand doesn't have trump left|pg||

nt|finch: or it could be invitational with the minors (that's how I play it)|pg||

nt|finch: that's what I would call an 'aggressive' 2@D overcall at red|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|finch: EW obviously on the same wavelength, as surely East is close to raising a sound overcall|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|dburn: not completely clear that North-South will get these to game|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|finch: good prediction|pg||
nt|dburn: since South doesn't have to have a sixt heart for 2@h in this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: doesn't North have an invite, if they play sound opening bids?|pg||
nt|ady: stopped short      surely worth 3@H|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Kevin Cautious looking at Axxx @d|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|xenya: still N has a good hand -- the pass is questionable i think|pg||

mb|p|nt|jallerton: Does 2@c imply interest in other strains?  If so, W should try 2@d|pg||
nt|finch: I wouldn't mind playing 4@S EW here.  Particularly if I could see the NS diamond cards first.|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H!|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|dburn: is it? without a spade lead at trick one, there seem to be ten winners|pg||
nt|ady: well they have got a 22pt semi mis fit|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: 1@h? is that some cunning plan?|pg||
nt|finch: it would a more amusing cunning plan NV|pg||
mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|thegarve:  Everton win penalty shootout|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dburn: 3@h certainly seems to suggest some artifice - a passed hand facing a vulnerable overcall ought to bid more than that|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dburn: still, I guess 3@h has good chances|pg||
pc|hA|nt|finch: this may well take more tricks than it technically should, because the defence will not have the right idea|pg||
nt|dburn: again, declarer has pretty much the same ten top tricks as in 2NT without a spade attack|pg||
nt|finch: in fact I think it makes a load of tricks anyway with no entry to the diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: she can make 10 with all cards in view, not sure about single dummy|pg||
nt|finch: best is to take two hearts before touching clubs, but in practice she might win the heart and play a second club at once|pg||
nt|thegarve:  she will probably assume a@s is with West|pg||

nt|jallerton: with the @s layout a @d ruff won't be an issue|pg||
nt|finch: the percentage line in trumps is to play for the 10 onside|pg||

nt|dburn: maybe they can duck|pg||

mb|p|nt|thegarve:  you can play a 3@S reponse to 2@C as 4@S and 5@D|pg||
nt|finch: obviously you can make double dummy after the @SQ holds by enplaying North. |pg||

pc|d3|nt|shevek: north should duck this|pg||
