nt|ady: good evening|pg||
nt|lestergold: evening all hi David|pg||
nt|lestergold: and... its the St Johns Wood commentary team!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: hi all|pg||
nt|panja: difficult to see why North played that. The only reason could be that it is not normal, so it must be good|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Martin, Shirley, David, Jack and Bob|pg||
mb|1H|nt|idc: and you can't get the contracts anymore either - 1@h at the other table isn't going to set our pulses racing|pg||
nt|galadriel: Transfer response then pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi roland|pg||
nt|Walddk5: our operator is Matias Rohrberg|pg||
nt|hedyg: you can find the CCs there|pg||
mb|p|nt|bcallaghan: Danger of getting too high in spades.|pg||
nt|keylime: 2@d Multi to start from North|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi jack|pg||
nt|joest: hi Martin|pg||
nt|ady: first hand looks like 4@S n/s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening everyone and welcome back to Estoril|pg||
mb|2H!|an|8-10 3!h|nt|mariner1: 2@S either multi or weak majors|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need Flash Player 9, some don't. ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|ady: looks like e/w  may reach 4@H    which should fail|pg||
nt|lestergold: and we are i think about to witness a doomed 4h|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Shirley Ybarra, Geoffrey Wolfarth, Jon Sveindal and Panja|pg||
mb|4H|nt|idc: at other table - North opened 1@h to show 11-15 and 4+ @s, so South passed it|pg||
nt|chen_xin: µÚ2½Ú¿ªÊ¼ÁË|pg||
nt|chick: possible to make 4@S, losing a spade and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|jbgood: good evening|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is sweet Isabel @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|vugraphzmh: http://www.quintonaipe.com/fed09/gpp_eq.html|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d=3+ cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|bcallaghan: 4S looks like a fair contract, but not on this layout.|pg||
nt|panja: 5@D is a nice contract on board 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: puppet will help here I think |pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: oops|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Not a good idea removing partner's penalty double with a defensive trick.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If 3@H showed his hand, he should not overrule partner's decision to defend|pg||
nt|idc: ok, my pulse is racing now, I admit that|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW can make 3N here if they get there|pg||
nt|keylime: good agreements needed here on where bids show stops or ask for stops|pg||
nt|ady: hi Jack|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bjacobs: Strange auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: horrible duplication and bad trumps but normal to bid it and will probably end up as a push|pg||
nt|ady: 27 pts  game should fail    3NT   may make|pg||
nt|ady: hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi again David|pg||
nt|lestergold: it lloks like only us here this evening|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes we can see how much superior 3n is but how can they reach it?|pg||
nt|lestergold: east has the values to bid 4h over partners normal raise- he has no reason to give info to opps bidding 2s which muight indeed encourage his pard to tryy no trumps but its a double ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: dummy auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: Martin isnt famous for his fast declarers play, thats for sure.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello David and Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: is he very tall and thin?|pg||
nt|ady: even 3NT has its problems on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and welcome back to Jesper Thomsen|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Roland|pg||
nt|pentacon: Hi David and mike|pg||
pc|c5|nt|galadriel: Well, this makes the other table look tame|pg||
nt|idc: I'm getting a feeling that we are approaching 'last rubber of the night' territory|pg||
nt|chen_xin: ×ønsµÄÊÇÉòÑôÊ¥ÓêÌï¶ÓµÄ¾²ÐñºÍÑÏÇà|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Why does South prefer hearts to spades?|pg||
nt|sybarra: got here just in time for the excitement |pg||
nt|ady: Hi Jesper|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mariner1: this is 16 boards from Shenyang, China|pg||
nt|chick: not so sure about that, panja.  a lot of ruffing needed and diamonds are 4-1|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs Q@H in N instead of Q@C for slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Jesper|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt is not as good..even with @S finesse there are only 8 tricks...but E must switch to @C at trick two|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt = 18-20?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|keylime: friendly lead for declarer here|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup super first hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: the teams are currently in 1st and 3rd position - Jourdain in 3rd|pg||
pc|c7|nt|idc: the one that lasts for 3 hours and features many four figure penalties as the empty beer bottles build up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 800 on best defence|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Convention cards from  http://www2.bridge.dk/Default.aspx?ID=1374|pg||
nt|ady: they have just bid a 27 pt 4@H   which looks doomed|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mcarroll: Nicely bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Isabel, welcome to you too|pg||
nt|sybarra: play wont take long |pg||
nt|joest: hmm|pg||
nt|cuttysark: There seems to be a tredn towards 2-openers that include a balanced 18-19.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 18-19|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he will win @HK and return @H10|pg||
nt|joest: if 3NT is both, are there enough bids left to show one and none?|pg||
nt|joest: I'm sure they have it all worked out though|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C  puppet stayman for 5 card majors    2@D  shows no 5 card major   but both 4 card majors|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I was taught that was very dangerous|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Martin is short and thin|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|joest: I thought 3@d showed both|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Nut it has worked well here when C!Q drops nicely|pg||
nt|hedyg: welcome to Gad Chadha and  Joe Shair|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|calabres: we have con problems, will be fixed shortly|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mariner1: continue 10@H.......|pg||
nt|chen_xin: ÏÖÔÚ³¡ÉÏÐÎÊ½¶ÔÊ¥ÓêÌï²»Àû|pg||
nt|sybarra: goes down on @H and @H ruff, |pg||
nt|sybarra: easy from here |pg||
nt|jbgood: S asked for a @d shift - couldnt imagine N had seven of them|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chick: 9 tricks now ... 3 spades, 1 heart, 1 club, 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|panja: we know @C lead would have been killing, but one can understand West not wanting to lead that after the 2@C bid|pg||
nt|chick: club lead would have given him much more problem|pg||
nt|joest: as long as they know.. :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Good morning Hedy.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello Joe and Gad|pg||
nt|viren169: Hi all|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www2.bridge.dk/Default.aspx?ID=1374 for CCs|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Gad.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|idc: I suspect Cooke in the other room will take this result as a vindication of his pass of 1@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: for an international event, this is quite a late start|pg||
nt|lestergold: it has a smuch chance of survival as a mouse in the jaws of a crocodile|pg||
pc|dA|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|roswolf: well still off |pg||
pc|d9|pc|s2|nt|viren169: Hi Joe|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|idc: and no one will be able to argue with him|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's pointless anyway. He will tell you what's right and wrong|pg||
nt|cuttysark: A swift , slightly embarrassed claim, one feels|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh so not related to Robson then|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe calderwood|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chick: guaranteed to ensure that "night people" win.   morning people have no chance|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk5: Hemberg, however, is around 7 feet tall I think|pg||
pc|h9|nt|keylime: declarer would have had some more work on a K@s lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Auction was perfect until the 3@H bid|pg||
nt|calabres: Hi all, please be welcome to the PORTUGUESE GRAND PRIX 2009 - Estoril (Teams). We are in 2nd day of the event, round 4.|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Maybe 6  6|pg||
nt|ady: given himself the best chance     south a bit end-played|pg||
nt|pentacon: Standard Gam, bad Luck|pg||
nt|lestergold: but not endplayed enuf to give contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: exit with ht|pg||
nt|ady: seems best|pg||
pc|h2|nt|galadriel: NS had a very good start to their debut weekend, with some good cards on Friday/Saturday|pg||
nt|galadriel: I hope they enjoyed the experience|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9 never?|pg||
nt|lestergold: south does not know that a club discard wont help|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: claim|pg||
nt|santyclz: Or "the q is with the 9", either works.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|panja: does the ciesta change the morning and night people division?|pg||
nt|chick: no, it's physiological|pg||
nt|roswolf: hard to predict what will happen in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Sorry Liz and Geoffrey, you went to the wrong match|pg||
nt|lestergold: does know that partner cant have spade K|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hemberg's wife tells me that Rico measures 195 cm and weighs 85 kilograms. What's that in real money?|pg||
nt|lestergold: much kroner Roland|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: not so much in BMI...|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mariner1: would have to win 3rd @S and run 9@D to make|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Bill|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jbgood: maybe W will just bid a number of spades instead of going slow - and buy it in game|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You are in closed room of Konow v Koch-Palmund|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am supposes to be chatting danish?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: supposed to be I mean|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah sorry!|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No Danish there|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Bye all :)|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Also welcome to Henrik Røn|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Hi all|pg||
nt|mollerjep: This is a nice result for Schaltz....They wont get a bonus in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: well east can tank as long as he wants but no honey nowehere|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bjacobs: Hi|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bjacobs: There was absolutely no basis for North to push on to the 3 level|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s9|nt|keylime: declarer is safely home, but a shaky start to both pairs here - with the length of match being only sixteen boards, could be rather interesting in the middle stanza|pg||
nt|mcarroll: looks like they know exactly what they are doing!|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't know if Papi's rule:  "if they didn't lead it they don't have a singleton" applies to this.|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Maybe. Schou - BrÃ¸ndum also open 2C with 18-19 bal|pg||
nt|ady: south now comfortable|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: not a lot between 4@S  and 3NT here       4@S   might have gone down on some hands with 3NT making|pg||

mb|1D|nt|ady: looks like 1NT  e/w|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: And Wales could well overtake England for the runner-up spot|pg||

nt|lestergold: should do they have the values will lose a club a spade  and a heart|pg||
mb|d|nt|keylime: 1@c is precision, double is a mathe takeout for majors here|pg||
nt|chick: morning people are normally alert from about 7am to 7pm.   night people are normally alert from 3pm to 3am|pg||
nt|panja: y, what about those who are used to having a longish afternoon nap? ...is that why it is so late in Portugal? Is an afternoon break the norm there?|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: but against England you need to create your own luck to an extent|pg||
nt|sybarra: at a not too high of level (like 1) |pg||
nt|joest: the club guess is what thishand is about|pg||
mb|2H|nt|panja: and the lead might give that away|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I would have opened the South hand. 5 controls and 5-4 shape. What about you, panel?|pg||
nt|idc: ok, that's me 1-0 ahead on sporting cliches, someone else's turn now...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: the def may yet lead a @C to solve all problems|pg||

nt|hedyg: 1@D= 4+ cards, 10+hcps|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to do the work but shouldnt be a prob no nasty surprise|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bcallaghan: One level too high, but still gaining IMPs.|pg||
nt|idc: Yes for sure Roland, not even close.  As 11 counts go that one is prime.|pg||
nt|jbgood: difficult to fint the heart fit now|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this might be ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|ady: will need to play with some care    only 3 losers   but needs to ruffs to make 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 1N now shows positive response no 5 cards suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: The boys done good...how about that?|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: I would have opened, but I count an extra half point for each ace, so I would have had a 12 count.|pg||
nt|mariner1: N again needs to pass|pg||
nt|chick: nap can help, but not really change it much|pg||
nt|mollerjep: Schaltz is famous for there slams....this is NOT one of them|pg||
pc|c2|nt|keylime: 2H doubled, some action already|pg||
nt|panja: ah, did I spell it wrong?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this may have a problem on a diamond lead, as there is no quick re-entry to the South hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D lead came from the other side in OR   much easier then |pg||
nt|hedyg: tough decision in N|pg||
nt|ady: good lead for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes he has to ensure that he gets all his extra tricks by ruffing but i think the latout will allow this|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course a thin contract on a worse day would have no play|pg||
nt|lestergold: but with trumps 3/2 spade ace right and no overruff positions it should  roll in|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mariner1: this has some play|pg||
nt|santyclz: They did that just to spite you...|pg||
nt|sybarra: cards sit rahter nicely |pg||
nt|hedyg: so much for making 3@hs|pg||
nt|viren169: Not a good contract as the cards lie....|pg||
pc|c8|nt|joest: well a club won't look so appealing after the dummy is exposed|pg||
nt|panja: after 4@D 's are cashed....I  suspect there is a rationale for placing the @CQ with North....|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North will never learn|pg||
nt|roswolf: 9 or 10 tricks likely|pg||
nt|hedyg: need to go -3 vs 3@H=|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the lead doesnt hurt but funnly enuf doesnt actually give declarer an extra trick|pg||
pc|d2|nt|keylime: it does if declarer is careful - this also has the danger of 500 all over it if the ball is dropped.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nor East|pg||
nt|mariner1: well E helps out this time|pg||
nt|viren169: yes...|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|panja: North is unlikely to hold a 4-card Major...|pg||
nt|viren169: North was worried about the vul to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: of course, passed hand pd and all|pg||
nt|viren169: and too many hearts to dbl|pg||
nt|hedyg: double out of the question|pg||
nt|ady: spade up|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|keylime: and declarer gets an early gift.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: all down to how declarer plays trumps now|pg||
nt|panja: so he could have 3 or four Clubs...not 3 or 2..so is more likely to hold the @CQ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: well it has lots of play now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|galadriel: Wish i could say it was still early doors :(|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep|pg||
pc|s3|nt|joest: i agree with that|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: hes preparing the cross ruff of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: wont touch trumps|pg||
nt|ady: should take the club ruff before the spade ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: oppos cannot really play trumps to advantage|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe an original trump lead might have been effective even if it ended up costing a trump trick|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|werge: I fuly agree with mr. xin...!|pg||

nt|henrik_r:  So John how is your favorite in this match?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|ady: will need to finesse twice    can do that|pg||
nt|panja: from either side...he can finesse twice|pg||
nt|joest: he can pick up Qxxx either way|pg||
nt|lestergold: well still a long way for the solo by the fat lady|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: only clue is the 1@D bid - |pg||
nt|ady: got to get 3 rounds of trumps for that to be effective |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|keylime: I think he's got to tap the dummy with trumps here|pg||
nt|keylime: A@h and diamond exit appears safest|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1 @S gets ruffed and another on K@C|pg||
nt|keylime: closed room started with board nine so comparisons won't come for a bit|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch many vugraph rooms at the|pg||
nt|mariner1: same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need|pg||
nt|mariner1: Flash Player 9, some don't, Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North and East were both misled by their partner's bids on doubletons.  However, in neither case were South or West showing 3 card support|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: West more likely to have the ace|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcarroll: not now|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|panja: y..so better to play small from South hand, isn't it?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bjacobs: Well I was told that the Open Room had English commentary, but maybe I am mistaken|pg||
nt|panja: @CT first time was better..now he will have to open up some suit|pg||
nt|santyclz: Even if it would be taken a coop rather than the blacks.|pg||
nt|hedyg: S can not have the A@c or would have opened|pg||
nt|hedyg: so @c to the K is fine|pg||
nt|santyclz: (as)|pg||
nt|lestergold: and that may have been im;possible on the layout|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h3|nt|sybarra: nice pitch of the @H |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South was forced to do something.  And West had passed 1@S|pg||
nt|ady: cahs K@D|pg||
nt|ady: then ruff spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think it maters now|pg||
nt|lestergold: may well end up with 11 tricks here|pg||
nt|pentacon: Looks like a small devils coup :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: the cards are smiling on declarer|pg||
pc|s4|nt|werge: I was told the same|pg||
nt|lestergold: the trump pips in both hands sitting menacingly over the defenders truimps|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jbgood: E in trouble - can get endplayed on the 4th spade now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|santyclz: All the matchpoints for the @s endplay of e.|pg||
nt|hedyg: no rush to ruff @h|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|panja: rather, with longer Diamonds, West is the one more likely to be short in @H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cross to a diamond and lead a small heart towards the queen - but North going down now |pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: as West may have A, J, or 10 singleton |pg||
nt|mollerjep: It's very even....but my bet is Schou....also because of the carryover|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  I think it will depend greatly upon how much we see of Martin Schaltz - Rico Hemberg and HC NIelsen - KA Boesgaard|pg||
nt|mollerjep: and your favourite? |pg||
nt|henrik_r:  They have been a little inconsistent during the season|pg||
pc|d6|nt|keylime: and that should be 670 now|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
nt|lestergold: are the ndefenders going to get any tricks?|pg||

nt|lestergold: pity this isnt match points|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|mcarroll: Unusual - but effective|pg||
nt|ady: discard J@S|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: nice|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  I think Schaltz has the best pair in the brothers|pg||

nt|bobholl: 6 @S missed ?:)|pg||
nt|panja: E will be tempted to pass..|pg||
nt|sybarra: can they find the @S suit?|pg||

nt|henrik_r:  A frisky repoening by Jacob Vul vs non-vul|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ady: looks like e/w can make 4@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3rd vul against not anything is possible|pg||
nt|galadriel: May get the @H lead :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: NV against vul rather|pg||
nt|panja: well, no suitable way to get in after the 2@S opening....|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy to get in that auction |pg||
nt|henrik_r:  2C shows majors and Rdbl asks East to bid the longer |pg||
mb|3S|nt|joest: second seat vulnerable partner should be reasonable so I think it would be conservative of east to pass|pg||

nt|bjacobs: And now the question was: should East have tried 7@D?|pg||
nt|panja: exchange @HA and @CA in NS hands..and 4@S will make for EW....is anyone surprised that E did not bid further even after 2nd seat Vul vs. fresh 2@S opening?|pg||
nt|ady: might even make 6 spades|pg||
nt|panja: I am told 2@H shows @H + some suit...do we have a confirmation of that?|pg||

nt|hedyg: making 12 not so obvious with the 4-0 split|pg||
nt|viren169: not a bad 7|pg||
nt|hedyg: if you ruff 1@c you lack an entry to the @ds for discards|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n i think inferior bid because he has no reason to believe that partner has fortificastion in both clubs and hearts|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mariner1: well a Rabbi has a good chance here|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1 keycard|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is no surprise to N|pg||
nt|viren169: not easy to see 13 tricks from North's point of view|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bjacobs: But not much reason to find the rabbinical play|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 12 tricks now |pg||
pc|s3|nt|mariner1: Rabbi's Rule = when K is singleton play the Ace|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer might make this if he leaves trumps alone|pg||
nt|roswolf: a @D looks a good shot|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mariner1: interesting lead from QJ @D|pg||
nt|mcarroll: There are traditionalists who argue that you never open 2@H if you also have 4@S|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|hedyg: just as well since they are not there|pg||
nt|viren169: If North had made a try... South would have accepted|pg||

nt|santyclz: Basically has to guess @sj9xx in e.|pg||
nt|mollerjep: a trick blew away|pg||
nt|hedyg: just draw trumps, A@d and small @h|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: 3n makes because decl;arer can duck two rounds of hearts cutting them out of the picture|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I think their system is not the "traditional" weak 2 bid |pg||
nt|santyclz: Which is not unreasonable on the auction.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mcarroll: which certainly means that you never get to 6@S|pg||

nt|keylime: partial swing potentially there|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Amazing hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: me neither jack|pg||
nt|panja: it is good to play a non-normal game, adds spice.....you don't really need justification|pg||
nt|joest: could have lost to stiff jack of spades.  I guess I could see losing the hook but certainly seems right to start with the king|pg||
nt|roswolf: good instructive play - well done|pg||
nt|sybarra: I seem to owe a lot of specs|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam time again|pg||
nt|santyclz: When E. F. Hedy speaks, people listen.|pg||
nt|hedyg: would have been more fun on a @D lead|pg||
nt|viren169: I dont blame them...|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|mollerjep: 4h?|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland slam alert!|pg||
mb|1D|nt|panja: ideally, @SKQ after @HK was ruffed..|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: To defeat the contract, North probably had to give away a ruff sluff when in with @CA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: likely 1NT=15-17 in 3rd and 4th positions |pg||
nt|roswolf: an ACOL2 - wonders will never cease|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Though to get there|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  And it also has no play I think|pg||
nt|mollerjep: and tough to win|pg||
nt|santyclz: This hand looks like fun.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bjacobs: All too hard|pg||
nt|sybarra: S finding the bid "amusing" |pg||
nt|joest: so now if the panelists had a 'majors' call avaiilable here would you trot it out as east?|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: not me, I would need suit body..|pg||
nt|joest: put me in the 'yes I would' column :)|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Wow|pg||
nt|mollerjep: thats the way to do it :-)|pg||
nt|viren169: could get interesting...|pg||
nt|viren169: N has both support for pd and defence...|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mariner1: 5 of a minor..... 5@C best I think|pg||
nt|mcarroll: vulnerable ? not me|pg||
nt|bobholl: not with those beautifull @H|pg||
nt|joest: i'm clearly outvoted!|pg||
nt|sybarra: @S suit nothing to write home about either |pg||

mb|p|nt|chen_xin: 7dÒ²Ðí°Ñns¼·µ½7h|pg||
nt|ady: this seems comfortable    wsill probably try J@C   and when that is ducked  play spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: that beautiful play gathered 5 imps, as the other room tried 4 @S |pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d is good news for W|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D  can make here|pg||
mb|2D!|an|2 way checkback|nt|henrik_r:  I would have guessed that Dorthe had about maximum|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: In theory, neither makes|pg||
nt|mcarroll: no problems now|pg||
nt|panja: this works out fine only because North has wasted values in @H..opposite a singleton|pg||
nt|viren169: 4333 shapes are not usually good for generating tricks |pg||
mb|3D|nt|galadriel: Seems no-one likes @Ss anymore|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Seems impossible to get to spades. I am lost|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Seems to be an anti-spade pact.|pg||
nt|mollerjep: peter is famous for winning these very difficult games, so....|pg||
nt|lestergold: sadly with heart finesse wrong its not too great unless no club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianrei: I think the first X showed H|pg||
nt|galadriel: I always thought that 1@C (1@D) X guaranteed equal length in maj|pg||
nt|sybarra: well...|pg||
nt|chick: sure would be interesting to know what each player thinks these bids mean :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder if this is a bidding misunderstanding - apologies to NS if not|pg||
nt|ady: has to ruff 2 clubs  to avoid any heart view|pg||
nt|lestergold: therefore arguably better than 50%|pg||
nt|ady: definately better    can discard a heart on 3rd spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes actually its too good for a roland slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: even onm  heart lead all the clubs go away|pg||
nt|lestergold: so will they bid it?|pg||
nt|ady: yes    no club lead    makes it easier|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Walddk2: Maybe Bowles' double showed hearts and Howard's a support double?|pg||
nt|panja: I can imagine so many hands where N would have 4 Spades and xxx or Axx of @H where 4@S would be odds on|pg||
nt|sybarra: N not letting S off the hook at 4 @S  |pg||
nt|mollerjep: comparison coming up and like I said 7 imps for Schaltz :-)|pg||
nt|santyclz: 4nt?|pg||
nt|hedyg: W: i dont want to cuebid @H, dont really have that much|pg||
nt|viren169: good news or bad news... they were committed to game...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@H has a playhas to find J@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not on that lead!|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 4@H is off now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a smart lead, if you think about it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The chance of partner being short is quite good.  And you have @HA to control the trump suit and give the ruff|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@H seems to be pushing it a bit|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a roland grand in fact|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but it sure looks like it :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: oops|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: sensible to play what you play over a NT opening over an overcall as well, so 2@H here=transfer to spades  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like 2@h was (North) cue-bid (South) transfer |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I would expect to see 5 @S in dummy|pg||
nt|roswolf: another blackwood misunderstanding it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I reckon South was expecting that.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|Walddk2: In that case the spade suit is lost|pg||
nt|roswolf: west should pass in sleep|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|bcallaghan: My preference is to play the double of 1D as guaranteeing both majors.  These pairs obviously don't.|pg||
nt|mariner1: now to make|pg||
nt|keylime: this is going to be a challenge.|pg||
nt|sybarra: well ace of trumps or a cashing ace in spades |pg||
nt|viren169: I quite like 3@H as fit jump and let pd decide where to go...|pg||
nt|santyclz: It seems to me that unless e-w are playing a big @c system, 4@h is mandatory, pd is unlimited.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianrei: and west's X showed 3H|pg||
nt|galadriel: I'm with you Brian|pg||
nt|ianrei: responses to 1C are transfer|pg||
nt|ady: 2 controls + queen of diamonds|pg||
mb|5N|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but you lose spades when opener is 4-3 in the majors and responder not strong enough to bid again|pg||
nt|ady: this also a good line     spade entry|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well can he make it?|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Schou apparently devalued his 18 to 15-17|pg||
nt|mollerjep: Schou only opened 1c on the 18 point hand... |pg||
mb|6D|nt|roswolf: now wst will be confident as long as there is no revoke by his side |pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think the @H suit is good enough and it denies @C shortness for me|pg||
nt|hedyg: i mean for the jumpfit|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: Ah, even after overcall?|pg||
nt|keylime: declarer will have to play desperate here, and the spade cover almost forces the finesse in spades.|pg||
nt|lestergold: and of course they have reached it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianrei: after 1D, X replaces the 1D response|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: yes, I see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I understand, but I am entirely happy with a system where you may lose the boss suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *not happy|pg||
nt|idc: Playing a short 1@c system, I used to play X as both or neither majors - but whatever you do doesn't matter, as long as you both do it|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes the @S lead and play allows a chance to make now|pg||
nt|keylime: the fact that a heart lead was indicated and rejected, interests me|pg||
nt|hedyg: no strong @c for EW|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: Hi ti the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was mistakenly in the Closed Room and missed the start of this deal.|pg||
nt|lestergold: so has no chjoice has to go for thye line of ruffing clubs |pg||
nt|ady: more interesting on this lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: much superior than the 50% available on heart finesse|pg||
nt|pentacon: best Lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: the most challenging lead the only one to give us any work as commentators|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|joest: time to 'cash out'|pg||
nt|lestergold: will pl;ay ace of clubs surely and give up a club|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe get a club ruff now |pg||
nt|sybarra: but E may not expect pard to have a @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: or other way round|pg||
pc|d2|nt|viren169: U are a passed hand... you cant have everything|pg||
nt|ady: good to lose your losers early|pg||
nt|lestergold: doesnt mind one round of trumps |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Could be that the 1NT rebid is 15-18 and they only open 2C on 18 good ones|pg||
nt|mollerjep: going down for sure...|pg||
nt|lestergold: lost the club to west because he didnt want the heart switch at that juncture|pg||
nt|lestergold: now he is set up club spade to ace club ruff spade to q ruff draw trumps finita la musica|pg||
pc|cA|nt|santyclz: I believe 6@c can make but not 6@s on a @h lead.|pg||
nt|roswolf: at rubber bridge you should cash the ace of trumps immediately|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||
nt|bobholl: !next|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mollerjep: 2 down|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Tor O Reistad suggests that 1@S should show both majors after a 1@D overcall if you play transfers. He has a point|pg||
nt|keylime: the fact that trumps are 4-0, infers more room for the diamond finesse as well|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mariner1: now W in a squeeze too|pg||
nt|keylime: the 8@d is a key card now|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|d8|nt|keylime: I'm thinkin two more rounds of trump|pg||

nt|mariner1: that could be a big swing|pg||

nt|sybarra: a real misfit here|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Could have gotten out for one down|pg||

nt|mariner1: 6@S makes here played in E|pg||

nt|roswolf: this is a perfect fit club game + a friendly lie of the cards|pg||
mb|d!|an|general strength|nt|idc: My guess is that Murdoch though there was no way his 2@s was going to end the auction, and he could support @d later|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Quite likely to reach 6D, but RKCB may stop them.|pg||
nt|idc: but it didn't turn out that way, though I find it hard to believe West would pass his 2@s with a max for the 1@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: N hand looks great now|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like a 20 count now!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Didn't look too shabby even before the x.|pg||
nt|lestergold: weak no trump will lead to hearts part score|pg||
mb|p!|nt|brolucius: Not an attractive 2@C opening, on such a suit at the two-level.|pg||
nt|panja: yes, but potential for 9 tricks for NS...the way the cards are|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially once E leads A@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: favourable lie of cards means 10 tricks look available|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but not a biddable gam|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mariner1: S is thinking 6 and hoping for 7,,,,,, should easily find out|pg||
nt|keylime: South not wasting any time here getting on with it either|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not much South can do here|pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not see a bid with S hand,  thinking might have been an overbid|pg||

nt|lestergold: hm|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: pleasant little hand this |pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 5@S shows 2keys and Q of @D|pg||
nt|roswolf: also 4 of a major is ok too|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: 5@s is two keycards with the queen here|pg||
nt|sybarra: can certainly understand why "we" are in 3 @C|pg||
nt|jbgood: Patrick Jourdain has been on the Welsh national team lots of times, and is the President of the International Bridge Press  Association|pg||
nt|santyclz: Remember this hand when you hear the old saw:  partner never has the perfect cards.|pg||
nt|mollerjep: a funny spade combination....you will always lose 2 spade tricks.|pg||
nt|viren169: No A of @H lead now!|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT showing a maximum hand, probably with either HHx or 4 card fit|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm this uaction is off the wall|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pentacon: I Thinks Pas  shows Double spad|pg||
nt|lestergold: then doubel fo the tyransfer bid should surely show hearts not a takeout of hearts|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Undo please|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: west will be sorry did not trow in    dont blame the opening with both 4 card majors|pg||
nt|ady: could have passed 2@H doubled here knowing a doubleton spade from North|pg||
nt|lestergold: north certainly guaranteed doubleton spade|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mariner1: nothing to play..... 6 or 7 depending on lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: 19 may go down a lot :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: they m,issed an opportuinity to get very rich|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mariner1: so making 6|pg||
nt|keylime: West wasn't going to bed with that ace|pg||
nt|brolucius: In standard Precision, 2NT was non-forcing. They are playing a different method.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: Workmanlike auction|pg||
nt|brolucius: On a diamond lead, declarer can try to steal an extra entry to dummy (to play clubs) by inserting the @D10. Of course this is not very promising once the @D9 has been led.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|panja: still, after the @H lead, they might make 5 tricks...just give away a small @H when in next|pg||
nt|ady: now looks like diamonds not breaking|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: could S double 4@H as retransfer?|pg||

nt|pentacon: Martin did'nt have lots of opportunities after the double from Rico|pg||
nt|lestergold: us monety players owuld have been delighted to play in 2h doubled|pg||
pc|h8|nt|brolucius: Since it was not convenent to enter dummy to lead a club from that hand, declarer makes the unusual play of the @C10 from hand.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 6@S on a finesse |pg||
nt|joest: Every time I read a Geza Ottlik book, I get a score about one board lower than normal the next time out :)|pg||
nt|panja: you cash your winners to rectify count for the opponents...that is suicidal..|pg||
nt|panja: if partner cashes winners, it is fratricidal|pg||
nt|roswolf: this has possibilities |pg||
nt|henrik_r:  That's why he is at the table and we're commentators ;-)|pg||
nt|mollerjep: you a right about that one :-)|pg||
nt|lestergold: why didnt south bid stayman rather thyan transfer bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Another swing to EBU, and it looks like they are going to win the competition|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which is offside...|pg||
nt|chick: the Rabbi can make 6@S on this|pg||
nt|sybarra: ues |pg||
nt|sybarra: Yes|pg||
nt|chick: none of the rest of us can, though|pg||
nt|sybarra: Rabbi rule:  play ace when K is singleton |pg||
nt|sybarra: (off side)|pg||
nt|panja: Geza Ottlik, the correct spelling, I am told, sorry for that mistake|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: for those that joined us a little late, comparisons won't be coming until board 9 so hence the lack of score.|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes that was nice|pg||
nt|chick: or onside :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: i always feel bad after reading one of geza's beauties and realizing that i am not good enough|pg||
nt|viren169: not sure many (if any) play dble as re-xfer|pg||
nt|viren169: interesting thought though!|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he elicited 2d he could have bid 2s nothing lost then we would not be playing in the inferiro denomination|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and for the first time ever England, Scotland or Ireland will not win the Camrose Trophy|pg||
nt|santyclz: The reached the good grand in the other room and the bad breaks in @ss and @ds beat it.|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: looks like like 3NT e/w    can make 12 tricks with no heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: meanwhile Scotland falling back to last place, after reaching the dizzy heights of second last for a short while|pg||
nt|joest: right bob|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If you are playing with your mother it is matricidal?|pg||
nt|ady: 1NT      or a diamond partial|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s can play in dims or even no trumps|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bjacobs: Redouble should continue the transfer, IMHO|pg||
nt|joest: no that is just dumb|pg||
nt|joest: just kidding mom! :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A;lways remember - your mother knows everything lol|pg||
nt|ady: 2C! inverted minor raise    at least the values to a limit raaise of 9 tricks|pg||
nt|joest: on a non-heart lead a slam makes :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: I confess I would have bid 3NT as West a few minutes ago|pg||
nt|mcarroll: that is far more than an inverted raise in my book|pg||
nt|ady: yes needs diamond finesse and club break     nice slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have opened as east - now he has a riskier entry ino the auction|pg||
nt|mollerjep: Ulriks nose is very big :-)|pg||
nt|hedyg: after 3@s rebid by S over 1@s could hardly play less|pg||
nt|hedyg: he might have had his bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: well david u think its a part socre hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: is there an upper limit on inverted raises?  |pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: it seems strange to me that the '6th' team can win the Camrose proper|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N forcing @H raise|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL?|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes REDBL for me too|pg||
nt|joest: don't forget the spade split too|pg||
nt|panja: the deemed natural 1@C opening falsely encourages West to move past 3Nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: likely to be a push though|pg||
nt|lestergold: and so did i|pg||
nt|lestergold: butr they havent|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bjacobs: Perhaps double showed hearts.  Anyway, North seems to have a natural affinity for the 3-level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I would be shaking in my shoes if I bid 3@C, but maybe it's just one of those things you have to do |pg||
nt|sybarra: Mike where did that orginate?|pg||
nt|viren169: West was a bit heavy for 4@H |pg||
nt|ady: this can be 2 down if defence gets it right|pg||
nt|pentacon: Strange Pas followed by 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its a very good 11 count|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: ulrik might have miscounted?|pg||
nt|lestergold: but surely only worth  an invite|pg||
nt|ady: 11 and a 5 card suit     suppose many open with that    so may be flat|pg||
nt|ady: may even make it if defence goes wrong|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence have five easy tricks if they choose to cash them|pg||
nt|ady: 6    if west finds a low spade switch|pg||
nt|lestergold: the spade switch will be very marked and i thin k the defence will prevail here|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarfer will play on hearts has no option|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bcallaghan: Looks like 6D is down, where the far worse 6H makes, or even 6NT by North with the right view.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: England has won the Camrose Trophy on 47 occasions, Scotland on 12, with these two teams tied twice. The Republic of Ireland won in 2000, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008, whereas ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Northern Ireland and Wales have yet to win|pg||
nt|mariner1: I would have DBL 2@S with N here to show I had a good hand|pg||
pc|c6|nt|keylime: tricky hand here, slam on just the N-S hands looks good, until you factor in the layout|pg||
nt|keylime: North knows now in concept that their hand is nearly pure in context|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to show @D void some how.... and stay in 6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: haven't the foggiest|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|mariner1: and 6 may be too much|pg||
nt|bobholl: S always start agressively :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: his pd had passed already and he had 5 losers, pd unlikely to cover 4 of those|pg||
nt|lestergold: and that will; make the spade sqitch guaranteed|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mariner1: 3N is very aggressive with the 1N sitting behind N|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not a bad idea.  This is a very difficult hand for N/S.  |pg||
nt|joest: this is the time for the aggressive lead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|keylime: the layout is insanely favorable for six tho - 3-3 spades, and the 150 honors in hearts|pg||
nt|ady: some play unlimited Martin   at  least a limit raise to 9 tricks    but can be anything|pg||
nt|panja: all because of the std 1@C opening being termed natural.....this is not West's fault, as one might put it|pg||
nt|joest: hold on.  West does not have a blackwood call|pg||
nt|bobholl: well h'll gain now :)|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Ulrik could consider doubling|pg||
nt|santyclz: Still it's a practical call opposite a passed hand, many of us would make it.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|henrik_r:  He has 3 CERTAIN tricks and knows that diamonds most likely are behaving badly|pg||
nt|pentacon: Declarer has to steal a lot to win 3NT|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|idc: please note my new personal quest - to get all the web sites changed that have England winning in 96 and Scotland in 95|pg||
nt|idc: it is really the other way around - remember, you heard it here first :)|pg||
nt|keylime: 5NT is 2 keys without trump queen not counting any possible ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes a @D lead makes it very tough.... @c lead actually easier..... @S lead nuetral|pg||
nt|chick: actually, N may fear a ruff and play A@S|pg||
nt|chick: what?  the Rabbi's Rule?|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is what Ithought he might do |pg||
nt|sybarra: yes where did Rabbi Rule come from |pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: might be worried about @s split|pg||
nt|santyclz: However when I bid it, I'd alert it as a transfer to 4@s (by the opps).|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|viren169: lol|pg||
nt|viren169: sometimes the opps cant get in...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: they should make without the heart lead|pg||
nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|hedyg: pls claim 11!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bjacobs: I have some sympathy for their reaching the foolish 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: what else?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|keylime: and there comes the hammer|pg||
nt|sybarra: one of these K's should be right,  |pg||
pc|s8|nt|mcarroll: I play it is a good raise to 3, for stronger hand ther are better poddibilities to describe the hand - but has certainly worked here|pg||
nt|pentacon: Nice and fast cut !|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: i have an appointment in 2 and half hours..|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mollerjep: indeed he could|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mariner1: no play for 7 that I see|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bobholl: in a lot of  partnerships 4@D would RKC|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|keylime: this redouble is going to hurt|pg||

nt|panja: what if East had 2-4-3-4 shape? would the bidding have gone same?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|bobholl: i would bid a simple 3NT as west partner having 12-14 balanced :)|pg||
nt|panja: 1 more slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|galadriel: E too good for strong NT|pg||
nt|idc: I've been checking back recently over Camrose history|pg||
nt|sybarra: and other room didnt find the slam on bd 8 either|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes the spade switch will always become obvious on the hand|pg||
nt|ady: this time 3NT will make|pg||
mb|1C|nt|keylime: both rooms are playing at relatively the same pace it appears|pg||
nt|keylime: 3@h is a pass/correct bid here|pg||
nt|joest: they'll do well to get to slam after an initial pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is not a game that should bebid imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: drury?|pg||
nt|viren169: or just 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: because declarer has to expose the heart position to make tricks|pg||
mb|2D!|an|limit in !c|nt|bobholl: this slam is  better|pg||
nt|panja: 6@D seems to be cold|pg||
nt|santyclz: Too much and too flat for a 4@h call.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Desperation time. 1@S has little merit in my opinion|pg||
nt|mcarroll: an unusual contract - to say the least|pg||
nt|joest: it is possible diamonds will never be bid!|pg||
nt|ady: bidding catastrophy in OR     6@D  on    played in 4-1 fit|pg||
nt|joest: it wouldn't surprise me to see it go 2NT-3NT from here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c bergen, 9-11|pg||
nt|hedyg: also by passed hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: coffe hand|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mariner1: well 4@C might work here.........|pg||
nt|panja: there is so much of inequality in treating suits..6@D to AKQ and 4 poor @H to J....the dbl treats them equal|pg||
nt|bobholl: what would 2nt mean in your partnership now ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: CR is playing board 1 now, so the scoreboard will get some use now|pg||
nt|chick: 2@D multi ... 4@H says play game in your suit, whichever it is|pg||
nt|mdgraham: pass-or-correct 4@H, assuming a weka two in a major with South|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks to our terrific operator in Estoril, Portugal.  Job well done|pg||
nt|roswolf: and opening 1nt is a good way to stay low|pg||
nt|mollerjep: after a slow start Schous team is fighting back...|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: the first decade of this century worst ever for Scotland: we have been below average in Camrose table for 7 of last 10 years|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: As the Multi didn't work a few boards back, he's opened a thin 1-bid instead.|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL too strong for me|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to my co commentators Mike Graham, Cornelia Yoder and Panja.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South would do something different with a strong hand, if that is part of their Multi. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, thanks operator. Very smooth|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to the Portugese Bridge Federation and Luis Correia for bringing this wonderful tourney to bbo. |pg||
nt|sybarra: we are back in just a few moments after the other table finishes|pg||
nt|panja: what is the best way to play this?|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: after hardly even being out of top 2 out of 4 since ... it started|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In 1936 was it?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@S very aggressive and E must have seen his p's overcalls before|pg||
nt|sybarra: S is only an 8 count!|pg||
nt|roswolf: but perhaps they will just ignore me!?:(|pg||
nt|santyclz: With honors in the short suits.|pg||
nt|jbgood: Patrick is still young at heart|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont see why S wanted to press on, even playing puppet |pg||
nt|roswolf: i suppose 3nt has a play|pg||
nt|ady: not sure what 2@D is here|pg||
nt|lestergold: ten on top |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bjacobs: Right.  You'd have to sedate me as East if I saw 1@S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Otherwise 3NT would be bid in short order|pg||
nt|sybarra: you were right Jack |pg||
nt|mcarroll: This could be interesting - the @S bids  may help to get to a slam|pg||
nt|ady: game bid will be fine for n/s  will get  back losses from previous board|pg||
nt|joest: I thought 3@s was an overbid.  Is east contemplating more??|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@S will be expensive|pg||
nt|hedyg: if he plays K@D as well....|pg||
nt|lestergold: limit rais ein clubs we see|pg||
nt|ady: seems so    assume 3@C immediate   pre-emptive|pg||
nt|lestergold: too good for the preempt i assume|pg||
nt|ady: spec tells me 2@D  is 10+ hcp   and 5 clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: ten and only ten not an exciting hand|pg||
nt|ady: 5+ clubs|pg||
pc|h8|nt|keylime: this has some good chances now - layout again favorable for declarer|pg||
nt|mariner1: can he make this?|pg||
nt|keylime: I think he plays East for shortness in spades here|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: likely taking 9 tricks and home |pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Jacob-Ulrik play 1NT=6-11(12) and thus 2-o-1 is almost forcing to game|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|chen_xin: Í¬Ñù½Ðµ½3s|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a solid gain for jourdain|pg||
nt|santyclz: I predict +1.  See if it's my day for the track.|pg||
nt|sybarra: hope so,  then Geoffrey and I will send you!|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol|pg||
nt|mollerjep: and 2nt is of course forcing|pg||
nt|mollerjep: and not like in esbjerg where it means: we are probably already to high :-) |pg||
nt|hedyg: @c switch is a killer|pg||
nt|hedyg: else he makes it|pg||
nt|santyclz: But is neither automatic nor impossible.|pg||
nt|viren169: Was 8 a count of attitude card?|pg||
nt|hedyg: it was Malmo, whatever that means..|pg||
nt|santyclz: Even playing attitude 1st, most give count when qxx in dmy.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: means upside down count = odd|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he showed an odd nr |pg||
nt|hedyg: good we have Matias to help us!|pg||
nt|hedyg: the CC is in Danish of course|pg||
nt|hedyg: btw they call drury Toronto i saw|pg||
pc|c5|nt|idc: yup|pg||
nt|keylime: so it looks right to play to the K@s and back up|pg||
nt|mariner1: he knows E has most everything....... except @S|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  I think that 3C would only be invitational after 2D, all other bids forcing to game|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bcallaghan: Declarer may prefer a low diamond from hand instead of weakening a side suit. |pg||
nt|sybarra: getting out of Dodge I mean |pg||
nt|ady: 4S   would not play badly|pg||
nt|hedyg: wowwwwwwwwww|pg||
pc|cK|nt|viren169: yes!|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ianrei: he's probably thinking of ducking the lead|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mariner1: needs to preserve 8@S as entry|pg||
nt|mariner1: well the K@D actually make this easier|pg||
nt|keylime: yep. has to unblock trumps to be able to work on the heart play|pg||
nt|mariner1: now he can surely make it|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: there was a funny hand once where an English international opened 2@D (Multi)   |pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: dim switch needd to prevent any more oveertricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: jdims|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually not necessary stioll only ten|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|joest: in the other room, south opened and after rebidding 2@d, south heard a 3@h call from partner.  Partner thought it was a splinter; South thought it was natural. Hence 5@h four down|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Based on their convention card Jacob should finesse|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  9 usually promises one higher card|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  From 987x they would apparently lead the 8|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  But earlier we talked about who my favorite is|pg||
nt|hedyg: wd Ron!|pg||

mb|d|nt|Walddk2: This is an 11 count I would not open, but it's their style apparently|pg||

mb|2S|nt|panja: we begin with a 50% slam for EW|pg||

nt|viren169: Could be trouble here|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w will have to let this go|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Anne has already mentioned the NS overcalling style|pg||
nt|idc: I'd call it 'loose' - not agressive but loose|pg||
nt|keylime: EW also using precision is appears|pg||
nt|calabres: Hi all, please be welcome to the PORTUGUESE GRAND PRIX 2009 - Estoril (Teams). After 1st Round I will indicate the link to results.|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 @C fit short @C now ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: which is practically standard in China|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Good man|pg||
nt|sybarra: the other room starts on the  with 7 and 8 ... so we start first ... and you can see comparisons on open table|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mariner1: 3N works EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: better be in a suit here I think |pg||
nt|panja: supposedly natural 1@C opening, but W does not know the big Club fit..so he goes through 3@S..|pg||
nt|calabres: As Board Member of Portuguese Bridge Federation I want to thank BBO and Roland Wald for the schedule of these broadcasts on Vugraph. My special thanks to all commentators on Open ...|pg||
nt|calabres: and Closed Rooms. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suspect this EW pair play 1@C as natural|pg||
nt|panja: it is only deemed natural....3 cards should not really be termed natural...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is not the best spot|pg||
nt|calabres: Among other reasons, but mainly to the worldwide crises, bridge was affected too, so we will have only 21 teams, and some of them made by people who started to play bridge short ...|pg||
nt|calabres: time ago, we all must be grateful to them in name of their love to Bridge. Ty to all players.|pg||
nt|panja: 13/4 is 3.25, so anytime you have 3 or less cards, you have less than expectation value ...so unnatural|pg||
nt|sybarra: not bad on a @s lead which now unlikely |pg||
nt|panja: South is unlikely to lead a @D against 3Nt...note that N did not dbl 3@S...so North does not rate to have @S honour...|pg||
nt|panja: rather unlikely to lead a @S|pg||
nt|ady: notice they dont promise 4 hearts with the double|pg||
nt|lestergold: this lead will make life easy for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: the conly challenging lead was never happening|pg||
nt|lestergold: a trump!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mollerjep: This is the famous Ron-spirit :-)|pg||
nt|hedyg: XX=@C?|pg||
nt|viren169: N has come in too early|pg||
nt|viren169: probably single suiter with @Cs|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: xx is usually any one-suiter in denmark|pg||
nt|ady: yes    trump certainly best|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ianrei: west hands not ideal for the reasonable 5C bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Worst possible I would say|pg||
nt|panja: rather odd that after a suit is mentioned, 55 fit in that suit is not 'FOUND'|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to my co commentators  Joe, Geoffrey, and Jon.  Always an interesting discussion and insights.   (all of whom not going to track)|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|galadriel: 5@D on @HA lead...|pg||
nt|ianrei: better played by E - may get the HA lead|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Should go down. 3NT had more play.  Hard to guess.|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Not surprisingly I think 4D is quite OK ;-)|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  3D simply doesn't put enough pressure on the opps|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|ady: diamond back best|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: Thanks also to my co commentators  Jack, Panja, David, Martin and Bob. Always an interesting discussion and insights.  |pg||
nt|hedyg: our Matias is worth gold!|pg||
nt|christinas: NS double weak NT as soon as they have a good 13-count, so I think North didn't expect to be able to beat 2spades and so bid right away|pg||
nt|christinas: here it looks rather silly|pg||
pc|h3|nt|joest: i see. didn't think we were only playing 8 boards. sorry|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to the Portugese Bridge Federation and Luis Correia and Rosaline  for bringing this wonderful tourney to bbo. |pg||
nt|mollerjep: not everybodys choise but I like it too :-)|pg||
nt|santyclz: xx can be too many things to try to guess.  @cs, 2-suiter, minors, etc.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|keylime: and six clubs somehow comes home - might be too good for a Roland slam here|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 6@C would make... how to bid?|pg||
nt|keylime: it's a push and shove kind of slam|pg||
nt|keylime: I know in my normal p'ship, we probably bail at five clubs|pg||
nt|panja: thx all|pg||
nt|hedyg: so it asks pd to bid @c and you correct to your suit|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|nt|bjacobs: 3NT is a fair contract, despite the lack of points, because West is placed with all the cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: And to our specs,-- greatest audience in the world.  We appreciate you comments and thoughts@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to the Portugese Bridge Federation and Luis Correia  and Rosaline  for bringing this wonderful tourney to bbo. |pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: shrug, down 1|pg||
nt|ianrei: risky D play - what if partner has Qxx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, the queen is in the dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: this will wo0rk just as well because declareer wont get position of trump ace wrong|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mariner1: well even if he makes it he losed imps|pg||
nt|mariner1: loses|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Mind you, it needs @DJ to stand up ... and it does|pg||
nt|chick: I'm very surprised at the 3@S bid.   seems reasonable enough to bid 3@H.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bjacobs: Is West thinking of cracking this?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|keylime: B2: CR - EW played 1NT after North overcalled 1H.|pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure I get past 3N either|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Good thing he didn't |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|keylime: I know with me after I hear spades, my hand downgrades a bit|pg||
nt|panja: all because of wrong terminology...because 1@C is designated as natural.....|pg||
nt|ady: needs the K@D   set up before the heart ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: better cashh clubs or wont make em both|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: wonder if 3 @H is forcing to them |pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: And to our specs,-- greatest audience in the world.  We appreciate you comments and thoughts@HH!|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|h7|pc|d6|pg||
nt|lestergold: held it to 2 at least|pg||

nt|lestergold: yes |pg||
nt|lestergold: but he knew he had to do taht|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chick: but he got lucky with the lead, so will make overtricks when the other suits break nicely|pg||
nt|panja: he would have made just nine if North had not played second hand high|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mariner1: there is reason to play Q there and not 10@D|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|keylime: Q I think is superior - caters to more 4-2 splits, right Rob?|pg||

mb|p|nt|idc: an icon of someone queueing to buy beers would help to identify dummy, in a meaningful real-life way :)|pg||

nt|calabres: Hi all, please be welcome to the PORTUGUESE GRAND PRIX 2009 - Estoril (Teams). We are in 2nd day of the event, round 5.|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4 @S migth go down on @H ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: east will and quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: England only 18 behind now, but it's a little too late. Only 2 boards remaining there|pg||
nt|garnetts: I hope that is not a weak two :)|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Dorthe should jam the auction with 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.  Hi Cornelia.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Cornelia, Mike and Joe|pg||
nt|ady: another part score      east will contest    but 3@H   might be too high|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H     way over the topp|pg||
pc|c4|nt|idc: but as a passed hand, North can bid a 4 card good raise 2@d, and stop in 2@s :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi all from famous transatlantic alliance A commentating team of Mike here and Chick|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Even though he has 17 hcp Ulrik should pass because of lousy distribution and @HKQ which are not very good|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c 3 cards 11 +|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|galadriel: They apparently don't play that|pg||

nt|chick: and Joe :)|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 2cf double vulerable might be worth about a non vul game or so|pg||
nt|joest: yes|pg||
nt|joest: east will do well to run right now|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2d would be a good bolt hole|pg||
nt|joest: not that it's clear.  It's a guessing game now after the t/o double|pg||
nt|joest: btw, would anyone consider 1NT by West as being for the minors so as to forestall a problem like this?|pg||
nt|bobholl: would be a nice understanding but not realistic imo|pg||
nt|joest: West certainly wants to stop a 2@h rescue if he can |pg||
nt|lestergold: i would not be too happy with north's hand defending a 2 level contract|pg||
nt|mollerjep: a good pass by ulrik|pg||
nt|ady: think down 2|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: and Joe too .... wow|pg||
nt|santyclz: Somebody has to do the comedy relief.|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  If I were to bid anything I would prefer 3NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: Close to a 3@h bid.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|keylime: B3: partial swing as predicted; six imps for a quiet 2@c partial instead of a push for the need to cash the club ace|pg||
nt|garnetts: Might get too high I suppose--but no good reason to|pg||
nt|chick: a good idea, but not without long discussion|pg||
nt|joest: probably true but I'm not sure that 1NT is natural or should be|pg||
nt|bobholl: bidding 1nt and than redouble migth be a good idea :)|pg||
nt|chthonic: After this auction -- through the redouble -- it might be reasonable to play 1NT as unusual.....|pg||
nt|chthonic: from west|pg||
nt|joest: i agree that the redouble makes all the difference|pg||
nt|lestergold: in 4s its not so easy for the defenc eto find a heart ruff|pg||
nt|joest: I'm sure n-s will happy to take the cash here|pg||
nt|chthonic: sort of a scrambling/unusual bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: east on lead why should he start banging down aces on air?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@C will go for 500 i think :)|pg||
nt|chick: close game here, might make it if he can get a heart pitched on the @DK|pg||
nt|lestergold: me im always so serious|pg||
nt|hedyg: would 2@h over 1@c be weak?|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot bid 3@H with that suit|pg||
nt|viren169: Yes... North would still have declined|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mariner1: well so do our NS|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ianrei: if they had stopped in 2S E/W could play their cold 3d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is why Drury was invented. To avoid the 3-level|pg||
nt|lestergold: if the cash is 200 it may not be good enuf|pg||
nt|ady: except   J@S  doubleton|pg||
nt|lestergold: vulnerbale againsty not it disobeys the dictum that you need trick taking security in your long suit top make this kind of bid the heart pips are terrible|pg||
pc|c2|nt|santyclz: 3@ds a transfer and 3@s a superaccept?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: deserves to be doubled and go 1400|pg||
nt|ady: in fact needs diamond shift|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bcallaghan: North - South have got themselves too high.  A bad advertisement for raising to 3 with four trumps.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sybarra: how to get out of this now |pg||
nt|lestergold: will do cos east has spade ace|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mollerjep: and thats the winner this time...|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  But I wouldn't have the balls to do it in real life ;-)|pg||
nt|mollerjep: of course you would :-)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mariner1: this time the position is different so 8@H hook was good play|pg||
nt|lestergold: patrick ill not take club finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: i wager u|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  The question is how Jacob will play spades|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Will he play Peter for @SQ10x ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim will come|pg||
nt|ady: this is going to slip through|pg||
pc|h3|nt|garnetts: 4@H is enough--hand has already limited and described |pg||
nt|garnetts: Golden rule limit your hand and leave it to partner |pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, 5 isn't safe but makes on this layaout.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chen_xin: Ê¥ÓêÌïÓ®»Ø8imp|pg||
nt|ady: can still beat it now with diamond switch|pg||
pc|d5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: 3D is one down I believe.|pg||
nt|ianrei: 3D is -1 if they take their tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: and if he didnt switch it would deserve to make|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|garnetts: If they stop they get lucky |pg||
nt|joest: i think it might be 800|pg||
nt|lestergold: now n/s can only make another three tricks so only 200|pg||
nt|viren169: suit is ok if pd has 3may be go via some sort of checkback|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: 4 made only off on heart lead which incidentally was marked on the takeout double|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: 2@S  from south should tell the story|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: now just hopes hts split|pg||
nt|lestergold: sory 4 tricks|pg||
nt|chick: good play, can afford to lose the @CK if avoiding a heart loser|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|lestergold: but it wasnt a very hardf switch to find|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't blame N/S for bidding on.  I wouldn't like to be defending 4@H in the hope that 4 black suit losers stand up|pg||
pc|dK|nt|garnetts: The think is about how to explian to partner that I should have bid 4@H if this goes off|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 3 cards he would raise 2@h|pg||
nt|viren169: all routes still keep N/S in the safe zone.|pg||
nt|hedyg: if S was weak with 6 cards he might have a direct 2@H bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: Christina would know :)|pg||
nt|christinas: yes, a jump to two hearts over 1club would have been weak|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty:)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|chick: Our vugraph operator today is Isabel Correia :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bobholl: tempo for 800 now :)|pg||
nt|joest: cash is good :)|pg||
nt|joest: west gets two more tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: 500 after all |pg||
nt|joest: he only has three now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|keylime: b4: 3NT making six, so the six club slam and excellent play, nets more imps to N-S|pg||
nt|sybarra: right|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ady: agree|pg||
nt|pentacon: Lots of noice i think, 4H on a 4 looser hand , he wont get partner to bid on the right values !!|pg||
mc|9|nt|mariner1: so a push|pg||
nt|joest: north might have pitched hearts there to get the club jack promoted|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h not justifiable vul because of the heart pips |pg||
nt|pentacon: As the Jack of hearts and the King of Diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: 3@H    is reasonable |pg||

nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Jesper Thomsen|pg||
nt|pentacon: Thx Roland|pg||
nt|hedyg: Christina do you play the same system with your partner?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3h invitational is fine|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: at the other table, a precision 2@c opener landed N-S into 5@c|pg||

nt|lestergold: 26 combined points hard not to reach n but it does not look at all promising|pg||
nt|joest: many would just blast 3NT right here|pg||
nt|lestergold: perfectly reasonable bid|pg||
nt|joest: i hate responding 3NT to 1@c though|pg||

nt|lestergold: if you play that as strong oityherwise double follwoed by a heart bid|pg||
mb|1S|nt|keylime: yep, that lead was charitable|pg||
nt|pentacon: Good ting for the match that its almost square|pg||
nt|viren169: how weak?|pg||
nt|santyclz: And an easy slam.|pg||
nt|christinas: slam i hearts or diamonds, hearts are better, since you can pitch a dia mond on a club and don't need to guess diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pentacon: Hi John|pg||
nt|viren169: Some play 1@C-2M= 6 card 3-6 hcps|pg||
mb|1N|nt|santyclz: Depends on how large and quick-tempered your teammates are.|pg||
nt|pentacon: Hi Henrik|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: Some people play Michaels as either weak or strong..would you call this strong?|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Thought I might see Michaels.  Want to avoid the trump suit that doesn't break though.|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  So Jesper who is your favorite ?|pg||
nt|pentacon: I'm with the local team, Schaltz and company ..|pg||
nt|christinas: yes, I play the same system, it is almost standard in DK to play those weak jumps, at least minor to major|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks like a good time to get a refill on my diet coke.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c short? or mini?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm|pg||
nt|lestergold: north will want to play this in diamonds sadly so will east!|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: infrangible 3b here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N|pg||
nt|christinas: 3clubs shows min|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this just doesnt make 4   good decision|pg||

nt|christinas: but north doesn't care..|pg||

nt|lestergold: west rescue to 2s??|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes they are all in there where angels would fear to treaqd|pg||
mb|d|nt|garnetts: true was wondering 3 can be beaten--maybe not on that lead a trump would have been interesting |pg||
nt|lestergold: make one up Chick|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3@S does it this time|pg||
nt|santyclz: For those interesting in purchasing the rights to the word "infrangible", Mike is running a special this week.|pg||
nt|lestergold: who ll know difference|pg||
nt|hedyg: i play it short|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D  would make|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: i predict a push|pg||
nt|bobholl: still lead @H after this bidding ?|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like on thier way to 6@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|pentacon: Hopefully Martin and Rico will play some nasty bridge the way i love it :)|pg||
nt|christinas: 5hearts two withoput the Q|pg||
nt|viren169: in double quick time...|pg||
nt|christinas: easy, claim and next board|pg||
nt|hedyg: either black ace is good for N|pg||
pc|h5|nt|galadriel: Oh well, he obviously thinks its too strong|pg||
nt|idc: if only the auction had offered a clue that suits were splittling badly|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: nice lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: claim|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 2d altho loses 3 trumps buty then only a further heart and a club so would have made|pg||
nt|pentacon: ups|pg||
nt|lestergold: the sad think for declarer hjere is that he will be staring at three dim gtricks in dummy which he can never get at|pg||
pc|h6|nt|idc: oh, wait a minute ...|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: I play any strength Michaels.  I like to get my shape over early.|pg||
nt|mariner1: DX just took the lead so this should bring it back to 1 imp|pg||
nt|lestergold: likely to be a push will lose the first 5 hearts and still another trick as he does not have 8 tricks without losing the lead|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mariner1: well 3N is out the window|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: Even if you don't, it's not too strong vulnerable opposite a passed partner|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|ianrei: this hand shows why Brian is right|pg||
nt|ianrei: 800 against a non-making game|pg||
nt|galadriel: I think this is a clasical vul Michaels|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|keylime: I am not a fan of redouble here - you have a clear idea of how you want to bid here|pg||
nt|keylime: unless, they are forced to systemically|pg||
nt|ady: reverse signals for n/s|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2d presumably showing the six dimns|pg||
pc|h8|nt|galadriel: 2 decent suits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Garvey bid Michaels in the other room|pg||
nt|galadriel: and gets your hand over in one bid|pg||
nt|keylime: CR also got to the laydown small slam, but earned an imp by not getting the A@c cashed.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: a small brake - we'll be right back|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|viren169: Coffee time...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|idc: Hmmm, I seem to be channeling the sarcastic spirit of Sam Leckie|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bcallaghan: Garvey managed to avoid doing something strange!|pg||
nt|garnetts: Is is still allowed to play a King and switch to show a singleton?   (rather than the Ace)|pg||
nt|santyclz: I like it at the 4 level and below (if not playing Rusinow).|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bobholl: south is kind of squeezed :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well there isa double dummy spade pin but that ill never happen|pg||
nt|lestergold: how about 'undefenstratable'|pg||

nt|santyclz: Too fat to fit through the window?|pg||
nt|lestergold: the word or me?|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence going very well here|pg||
nt|lestergold: this may well cost serious imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4 tricks lost and another r4 to lose 800 wow|pg||
nt|lestergold: north may imagine that he is endplayed|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: 800 or 1100, matters little|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: A club would have yielded 11|pg||

mb|2C|nt|mariner1: 4@H makes here suprised was not bid in Closed|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have a lot of sympathy with that|pg||

nt|santyclz: Are n-s playing a limited opening system?|pg||
nt|sybarra: no clue|pg||
nt|joest: i'm heading to the dictionary|pg||
nt|chick: I figure if you have the other 2 suits, you have X for a good hand and unusual NT for a poor one ... no need for michaels type bids|pg||
nt|mollerjep: tough to get to 5d|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Being a passed hand I do not understand Dbl|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Why not simply 3@D?|pg||
nt|pentacon: Perhaps Ulrik should have bid 4Clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: its 25 combined with e/w im not convinced they ll settle for a part score|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3N|nt|keylime: pressure bid of 4@s and the double was good tactics I felt|pg||
nt|keylime: force the opps to the last guess|pg||
nt|pentacon: Not perfect for a fit bid, but shows why |pg||
nt|mollerjep: thats the way |pg||
nt|henrik_r:  You could bid 4@C but it leaves room for N to bid 4@D|pg||

mb|p|nt|ianrei: 6C or D on the C position|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N makes too|pg||
nt|lestergold: i assume that n/s are playing strong n/t and kendrick has upgraded|pg||
nt|hedyg: but he will switch to @H and S will play 10@c back maybe|pg||
nt|christinas: but if he plays a H, S will return clubs, so it should be easy to beat|pg||

nt|christinas: @S|pg||
nt|christinas: just testing...|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: learning to write the symbols?|pg||
nt|hedyg: cute gadget|pg||
nt|christinas: yes, but sometimes I find it quicker just to write the first letter|pg||
nt|santyclz: Eerie guardless of whether the ace promises the k, s will return a @c.|pg||

nt|christinas: but that can confuse i suppose|pg||
nt|hedyg: no, its fine|pg||
nt|viren169: have I missed much?|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  can make around 10 tricks in diamonds|pg||

mb|p|pc|hA|nt|keylime: yep, this is going to get the treatment|pg||

pc|h7|nt|lestergold: hard for west to value his hand|pg||

pc|h2|nt|keylime: and CR bid and made 6@h for 15 imp swing|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes it was|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|idc: team of destiny versus the stone of destiny|pg||
nt|idc: we certainly have sunk like a stone...|pg||
nt|keylime: now the match is much closer|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: 6@D in the CR|pg||
nt|galadriel: Yay!|pg||
nt|joest: if east overcalls 1@s and catches a raise he blasts himself into game|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: but west showed nothing at all so cant blame east|pg||
nt|chthonic: except for 4-1 spades, six clubs might have made...|pg||
nt|joest: it's often harder to gauge the auction when you make a two-suited bid b/c partner winds up making many decisions|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9@C can be from 4 cards? no way|pg||
pc|hT|nt|chthonic: if spades offered two discards and clubs 2-2...|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|idc: that'll get it back under 100, phew|pg||
nt|ianrei: 6S only 500|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6heart tricks set up and with ace of dim entry its a cruel game|pg||
nt|ady: south not detered from leading partners suit|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mariner1: making 5|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1NT can work well actually on this hand type|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|santyclz: That would be my choice, I'm not lawful enough.|pg||

pc|s6|nt|pentacon: No square match anymore ..|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  It seems that Jacob did well by doubling 2@D on the previous board|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: another minor brake of play|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  At the other table they got to 3NT and Morten LM did not find the diamond lead|pg||

nt|henrik_r:  No indeed|pg||
nt|viren169: nice hand now... for a bit of action|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Partner's with no sense of humor can be tiresome.|pg||
nt|lestergold: no heart lead and jd with east and dims are se up to get rid of heart losers |pg||
nt|bobholl: a very good one to boot :)|pg||

mb|1H|an|x-fer|nt|galadriel: Were doing very well up till then|pg||

nt|lestergold: maybe n/sin trouble here|pg||
nt|mollerjep: You're brother did the right thing at the right time :-)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Another potential slam, this one unlikely either to be bid or make.|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H= 6@hs and 4@ss, limited hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: well e/w dont want to let them bid their game|pg||
nt|ady: a possible 4@H   for n/s     may be put to diamond guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: penalty may be a better option|pg||
nt|pentacon: 3Clubs is a transfer splinter , single Heart|pg||
nt|pentacon: 2NT would have been single Diamond|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mariner1: yes 1400 was not good|pg||
nt|joest: I think pass by north is losing bridge in the long run but that's just my opinion|pg||
nt|lestergold: whre is roland|pg||
nt|santyclz: A well deserved minus after n's foolhardy 1nt.  (If it had made it would have been a well earned plus after n's tactical 1nt.)|pg||
nt|lestergold: if east trusts his pards double|pg||
nt|chick: the victors write the history :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: no extras, just shape showing|pg||
mb|4S|nt|galadriel: Hello Brian|pg||
nt|keylime: here, a measly 1@s. |pg||
nt|mariner1: 1400 and 1@S  not a balance|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ahhh, now we see the other half of he 2@h bid.|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  2@H = 5@H 6-11 hcp|pg||
nt|lestergold: transfer to what?|pg||
nt|ady: 1@H  shows spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: EW play a multi-way 1@C with transfer responses and a strong NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder what they open with what would be a weak 2 @H|pg||
nt|garnetts: Interesting lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Luis.|pg||
nt|viren169: nice gadget to have in your kitbag...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: contract IS 4@h...|pg||
nt|hedyg: not very common to do it with both majors but widely used after a minor opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: N-S modified Polish Club|pg||
nt|galadriel: 2@C was bold|pg||
nt|joest: do east-west play a club system?|pg||
nt|lestergold: does north realise they have a mountain between them?|pg||
nt|chick: S comes to life, they might figure it out yet|pg||
nt|bobholl: vulnarable partner bidding 2 @S :) 4 1/2 @S|pg||
nt|joest: i would bid 4|pg||
nt|joest: or at least cue bid 3@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s have been dealt only 4 tricks that i can see buty onje will probably arise in the weash|pg||
nt|calabres: wlc Joe|pg||
nt|lestergold: the heart pips may produce that fifth trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: but dummy does not have an embarras de riche of entries|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Ian Crorie from Scotland|pg||
nt|idc: Hi all, Roland dredging the bottom of the commentating barrel|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless this is repeated in the open room , this could be a fair gain for the local team|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps the double will help him ... for example a low club to the 10 brings in 2 club tricks (as the cards lie)|pg||
nt|pentacon: Nice bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: and I came up...|pg||
nt|lestergold: without hesitation|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: wow|pg||
nt|lestergold: much easier money than playing in 4h|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mariner1: 3N played well in Closed,,, and not even close to finding it here|pg||
nt|bobholl: chickken :)|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Yes well bid by Dorthe and Peter and now making after the lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh my! E passed|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w have gone on itilt|pg||
nt|lestergold: tiltr|pg||
nt|ady: around 500|pg||
nt|lestergold: at least 500 and their game is not even guaranteed|pg||
pc|c3|nt|galadriel: NS play a very aggressive overcalling style, but they are young and adventurous|pg||
nt|garnetts: My guess is 2@D Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: was thinking same |pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: putting his pard under more pressure especially when he had a takeout double to staqrt with maybenot worlds greatest but he had one  in my book|pg||
nt|lestergold: 12 points and 4 cards in the other major i double|pg||
nt|chick: I think no question N should have made immediately takeout X|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you play ELC he surely had one :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|pentacon: 9 tricks from start|pg||
nt|pentacon: 10 now|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Sorry one over trick. Can't count ;-)|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to double hook the dims to hold the loss to 500|pg||
pc|c2|nt|galadriel: Hello Ian @H|pg||
nt|idc: yes, last one I watched was JTxxx for a non-space consuming 1@d over 1@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I remember the BBO usernames of East and South. Boeles is gnasher and Gillis is Capercliff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bowles|pg||
nt|galadriel: Yes and that got pd off to the wrong lead|pg||
nt|galadriel: that is the danger|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, East found the one disastrous lead: @HQ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bcallaghan: I wouldn't have overcalled myself, but it looks like it stopped EBU from finding the heart fit.|pg||
nt|lestergold: you double because you have to not because you like ur hand|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hedyg: wd!|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|keylime: this will net some needed imps for SYT here |pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: well 2 cl 2h and 2d will be  tricks but e/wwill make 8 tricks before that|pg||
pc|d2|nt|santyclz: 2@c show @ds or big hand?|pg||
nt|sybarra: must be |pg||
nt|garnetts: I have seen decs play the ace and pick up the whole suit|pg||
nt|joest: I'll have to remember that one Mike.  I'll use it on my partner next time I enter on some marginal hand and we go for a number :)|pg||
nt|joest: but I already weighed in on behalf of double a while back|pg||
nt|lestergold: true u diod|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: well defence has resolved the dims|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: iwas just supporting u because its so important to underline the degree of underbidding here by north |pg||
pc|d7|nt|joest: so just so I have this straight: 4@s = infrangible|pg||
nt|joest: I like it|pg||
pc|d8|nt|santyclz: The 2nd @h was fatal to -3.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|d6|nt|christinas: he has to quess the spades if N covers the Q|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s9|nt|hedyg: no entry to dummy to pick up 9@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: W won't get to dummy|pg||
nt|christinas: very unpleasant problem...|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|keylime: declarer's home here |pg||
nt|lestergold: tempo not looking good fro declarer 500 or 800 maybe|pg||
nt|santyclz: He should be able to get out for 500 now.  W needed to get @ds started.|pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed|pg||
nt|santyclz: Doesn't have a lot of etries to be able to guess.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: declarer is squeezed in a way if he discards dim then east can exit with a dim safely and declarer is behind declarer needs his clubs and hearts obviously |pg||
nt|lestergold: east may misdefend of course and play heart|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: the word is lready being rented out to a number of commentators i dont know if you can afford  the rent|pg||
nt|lestergold: now surely dim exit|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: error|pg||

nt|Walddk2: A lot of if's, but if EBU can hold on to a lead around 40 (21-9), England must win the second half by 50 IMPs against Wales to win the Camrose Trophy. So EBU in a very strong ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: position now that England are 33 IMPs in arrears against Wales|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Not exactly a triumph when Gillis had a normal raise.|pg||

nt|keylime: not something you hear normally..."plus 80, gain 16"|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: roland slam here frigid when qs appears and often frigid when they dopnt lead a club|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe too good for a roland|pg||

nt|mollerjep: what about the diamonds?|pg||
nt|pentacon: 7S i fantastic, nine card diamond fit, entry on King of clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: CR opened this 1H, preempt raise to 4, got doubled, and they let TWO overtricks pass through. |pg||
nt|santyclz: This is an accident-prone hand.|pg||
nt|lestergold: but not guaranteed|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|mollerjep: 5h and counting :-)|pg||
nt|christinas: actually I think he ought to make a club finesse when in dummy because of the entry problem. If Kx hearts is onside, he still has a heart to lose|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: not sure where N thought their tricks were vs 4@S in Closed|pg||
nt|keylime: B7: 4@c down 1, but more imps to SYT|pg||

nt|hedyg: 2@c?|pg||
nt|christinas: I think it is ok with Kx in spades - you have an easy rebid|pg||

nt|ady: will likely locate the 4-4 spade fit      must be carefull not to get overboard|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I was about to say you can have so many sophisticated methods for passed hand raises, 4@S here seems a bit agricultural|pg||
nt|santyclz: If it's right over 1@s, it has to be right over 2@ss.|pg||
nt|chick: I would think at least a negative double (intending to bid hearts later, showing weak hand long suit)|pg||
mb|3H!|an|4!s - pick a game|nt|keylime: East's done well to find a bid and get to a good game bid here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not for my money--I am sure I would bid 3@H now |pg||
nt|calabres: Results at : http://www.freewebs.com/fpbridge/2009_Estoril_Open_Teams_R1.pdf|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Luis|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@C is a great contract|pg||
nt|christinas: will S get interested now?|pg||
nt|viren169: South will be swimming backwards!|pg||
nt|christinas: actually 4 spades makes|pg||
nt|viren169: It wont be clear to South how good North is...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: Morten LM looks more irritated than interested|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3nt also.|pg||
nt|viren169: and why North did not bid 3@C over 2@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: N gets tapped on a @H lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: I'm not sure I'm in love with a 3@d rebid|pg||
nt|lestergold: not automatic to bid game on these cards but theyll be sorry if gtehy dont|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: What do we know, Anne?|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H lead and @D swicth needed|pg||
nt|joest: this has induced west, not unreasonably, to think maybe diamonds is a source of tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: but what else P won't have 4@H|pg||
nt|joest: i raise to 3@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n an appaling spot iof thats where they play but cant fil today|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant fail today|pg||
nt|pentacon: 6H from Ulrik first time ?|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Tough. Jacob has aces, but no tricks. Ulrik has tricks but no aces|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  My guess is that 4@S has a very wide range in their style|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s fine spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: may be the 2@C cues will win the board :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: Not alot apparently :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: he did not bid 3@c because he has 4@ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well J@C is not the optimum lead|pg||
nt|joest: indeed.  West is screaming for a heart control|pg||
nt|lestergold: this cue bid will prepare then drfence to beat the slam they look like they are headed for|pg||
nt|joest: south's pass of 5@h is big|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean they are leading a club whatever|pg||
nt|pentacon: 3H is transfer|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|idc: I think Gillis has done enough already, 5@h seems like overegging the pudding|pg||
nt|galadriel: Grand slam try froms?|pg||
nt|lestergold: no they are in the sensible spot of 4s but all three agmes infrangible tody|pg||
nt|ziff: Hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Matthias Berghaus|pg||
nt|ady: hi Mathiass|pg||
nt|lestergold: can lose a heart spade and a club afford that is|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Mathiass|pg||
pc|h4|nt|garnetts: I quite like the initial pass and bidding later if apt |pg||
nt|santyclz: After the opponents have shown no fit?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hedyg: this should make nicely|pg||
nt|christinas: I have to say that this shows that 2clubs wasn't such a bad bid after all...|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think I would have found a double at the table. What about you guys and gal?|pg||
nt|bobholl: we would seeing 52 cards :)|pg||
nt|joest: and now the 3@d rebid comes home to roost|pg||
nt|lestergold: well well|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D are 33 :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: club club fin ishes this one off|pg||
pc|sA|nt|galadriel: Not me|pg||
nt|galadriel: I have 2 other aces|pg||
nt|hedyg: it sure has worked like a charm!|pg||
nt|christinas: please ignore that I'm married to S|pg||
nt|christinas: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: of course !|pg||
nt|viren169: It worked well here...|pg||
nt|christinas: Schaltz need it|pg||
nt|santyclz: If we're supposed to ignore that you're married to south, what are you doing for dinner?|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: LOL|pg||
nt|christinas: :)|pg||
nt|christinas: Actually since you ask, I am dining with N's wife...|pg||
nt|hedyg: rofl|pg||
nt|christinas: so I'm absolutely partial|pg||
nt|christinas: In Denmark most top bridge players have been related to each other in some way|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: Is it too much to ask for a discussion of some relevance to the match?|pg||
nt|christinas: Matias is just annoyed because he hasn't had dinner yet...|pg||
nt|hedyg: well we are waiting for W to play!|pg||
nt|christinas: Actually my partner this season is married to West, just to prove my point|pg||
nt|hedyg: trying to fill the time|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: These are supposed to be entertaining as well as educational.|pg||
nt|hedyg: and she is kib here?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|idc: not with that @d suit.   Add in 2 side suit Aces and even less chance|pg||
nt|galadriel: Successful here though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Devastating if you are a Scotland supporter|pg||
nt|galadriel: yep|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: I thinks Bowles did very well here.  With two side aces either making or not, he tried to get a diamond established.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: interesting|pg||
nt|joest: now another club tapping dummy shuts out the spade suit|pg||
nt|santyclz: Don't remember when I've seen so many cards well placed.|pg||
nt|pentacon: Will Ulrik drive it to 6S if Jacob bids 5S on 5H ?|pg||
nt|christinas: In that case a bit strange Roland lets me comment|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|santyclz: Wd by n.|pg||
nt|lestergold: doesnt matter if he doesnt continue clubs cannot set up spades no entry to enmjoy them|pg||
nt|joest: true|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he will with that Jack|pg||
nt|mcarroll: true|pg||
pc|c3|nt|idc: he did - to be fair to the dbl of 5@d, he was probably expecting NS to stop in 5@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: could have made both @S |pg||
nt|chick: hmmm, probably thinks he should save the boss trump for later|pg||
nt|lestergold: so this  congtract is headed in prqactice for a few light|pg||
pc|c2|nt|idc: and a diamond lead may well be best against that|pg||
nt|christinas: oh yes, she is|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|galadriel: That's a good point|pg||
nt|hedyg: you are entertaining!|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant put this on gthe floor as cards lie|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, he did not envisage a slam to be bid, did he?|pg||
nt|joest: this was is not infrangible; it's inelegant|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@S is somewhat better then 50%|pg||
nt|christinas: And probably longing to say something:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|joest: this one|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: I can hear N's groan |pg||
nt|lestergold: Martin Garvey is floating around|pg||
pc|hT|nt|chick: *partner frowns*|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer will draw trumps and when dust settles will lose another club and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|viren169: get her on too!|pg||
nt|christinas: I dont know how, Roland has to fix that|pg||
nt|christinas: Besides they have 3 children at the age of 0, 2, 4 so she migth be busy:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Send a msg to Roland giving her id and asking him to ungag her.|pg||
nt|hedyg: she is afk|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|hedyg: we better ask her first|pg||
nt|ziff: This looks quite cold on the lie of the cards, only a mirage can save the defenders|pg||
nt|lestergold: chloice of ways of playing the contractr but all will lead to it making|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|calabres: The bid who disrupt all auction was th horrible 3@D|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: can set up 4th hert  to avoid taking winning diamond finesse|pg||
pc|s5|nt|thegarve:  oh no I'm not|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6d is even below the roland threshhold surely and whenever its making so is 6s |pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: Hoping to ruff out @CK, but no such luck. Besides, he is pretty short of entries anyway|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is almost as hilarious as you Chick|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: He also needs to lead a heart up|pg||
nt|sybarra: remaining under control per Isabel|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|joest: he's going to play spades from the top and go three light|pg||
nt|lestergold: going for restricted choice|pg||
nt|lestergold: or winning dim drop!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: but losing a spade in any case|pg||
nt|lestergold: whatever he does just loses that onme s[pade trick|pg||

nt|calabres: another fhantom slam :)|pg||

nt|mollerjep: another freak deal...|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  But this makes the match more interesting|pg||
nt|christinas: yes, but they were very far from reaching the playoffs. They won last year|pg||
nt|viren169: I see|pg||
nt|viren169: thks|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bcallaghan: 6S looks like a good spot here.|pg||
nt|pentacon: Another Grandslam :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: ugk|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: no reason to bid 6 on these cards!!|pg||
nt|joest: i can only describe the open room bidding as 'exuberant' :)|pg||
nt|calabres: in Open they havnt made blackwood:(|pg||
nt|lestergold: auction in closed decided for no discernible reason to do a blacwood bypass|pg||
nt|bobholl: MY 4@D bid 11-15 splinter :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i meant open|pg||
nt|santyclz: And the 2nt-whatever.|pg||
nt|lestergold: uve been reading too much Wald|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: yes - but always tough to bid a good slam when you have just bid a .... less than good one|pg||
nt|keylime: I am sure that Ligong are going to be shellshocked over the comparions|pg||
nt|lestergold: and in op0en |pg||
nt|christinas: It has been a very qualified season in the 1. division in Denmark - strong teams|pg||
nt|lestergold: yuch|pg||
nt|ziff: No prisoners....|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mariner1: 4@S does not play well too much off|pg||
nt|keylime: comparisons I meant|pg||
nt|lestergold: its what happens after the pslinter which is interesting|pg||
nt|joest: it's very important to have limited ranges on your splinters.  If you don't East can get too excited.  Or even worst the splinterer might come again at the five level and wind up ...|pg||
nt|joest: going down|pg||
nt|bobholl: not discussed what pass now means :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree Jack with limited strength splinters|pg||
nt|joest: I would think pass shows interest without a descriptive bid. Certainly interested in hearing a spade cue|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d=4+ cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: E-w made 3nt on the 1ntx'd bd, but they were only in 1.|pg||
nt|lestergold: not with gun to head not my style|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hedyg: no 2@c bid..|pg||
mb|d|nt|henrik_r:  1@S promises 5@S|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Dbl by S is most likely extra values without a good bid|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Now N is fixed because she did not set @D as trumps on the previous round|pg||
nt|mollerjep: would you have done that?|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Maybe, but 1@S could have been the right bid|pg||
nt|ady: this can make|pg||
mb|p|nt|henrik_r:  You "know" that your aggressive opps are likely  to bid alot of hearts before it is your turn again |pg||
mb|p|nt|mollerjep: spade is ok as trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: west has guaranteed that declarer will not make any misguesses here|pg||
nt|pentacon: club lead to defeat it !|pg||
nt|lestergold: i.e. will get club right and make it|pg||
nt|ady: needs a ace and another club to beat it|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: Don't they bid 2nd round controls I wonder|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The lack of 4@H|pg||
nt|idc: 1NT 15-17, 4@c unclear|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a bad save if its not a phantom|pg||
nt|pentacon: Void splinter in hearts on the first round ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: attitude leads|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: this could be touch and go,  @C lead  is more difficult |pg||
nt|sybarra: aha|pg||
nt|lestergold: well sanity remained in the closed room|pg||
nt|mcarroll: good bidding imho|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot ofm work to do in 4s if defence find ace of clubs lead and then ruff killing thye clubs suit then it snot all chopped liver|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless west makes double dummy lead of a low club|pg||
pc|s6|nt|henrik_r:  But @DAKxxx is all you need for slam in @D and how are you going to get your partner to coorporate now?|pg||
nt|mollerjep: she dont need coorporation :-)|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Yes but if partner had singleton spades and @DAKxxx and @CK how would I ever find out?|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  But I would most likely have bid spades at the table as well|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3 boards to play,,,,, next session scheduled for 32 minutes from now|pg||
nt|joest: Adventures in Slam Bidding|pg||
nt|pentacon: Lars and Morten Bid 7S on the previous board!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bcallaghan: Presumably 4C a cue.  Maybe 3H a genral slam try in spades works better.  Don't know their methods.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree Brian, and let 4m be a splinter|pg||
nt|sybarra: just guess the @D's for one loser |pg||
nt|santyclz: I see 8, doesn't anyone see a 9th?|pg||
nt|sybarra: @H's come home |pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think kelsy and ottlik would have written about these adventures|pg||
nt|mollerjep: I will never bid 6 small diamonds before AQJ10x|pg||
pc|h3|nt|idc: i expect you are right Brian - if 4@c were a splinter, the South hand has improved, if not, I prefer his 4@s signoff|pg||
nt|keylime: this hand is down off the hope a bunch on the heart lead|pg||
nt|keylime: at least one that I see, likely two|pg||
nt|pentacon: Peter only shows three clubs opening 1D, |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|santyclz: Yes, would be a bad hand for udca on the @c lead.|pg||
nt|lestergold: or ace lof clusb works yes|pg||
nt|ady: ace of clubs   and another ok|pg||
nt|ziff: That is the price you pay for 3@S, now and again you concede 590|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he didnt so no story except that wes wi llno t be doubling next time opposite one iof his partner s preempts|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  certain to make|pg||
nt|lestergold: youi could also be conceding 1400 or so david|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Finally some IMPs to Scotland. Must be your presence, Ian|pg||
nt|idc: though trumps are so good I might go for 4@h amyway|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: The main danger was that trumps weren't solid enough.  Not sure they addressed that, but OK here.  |pg||
nt|idc: thx Roland but the reality is once I start talking about bridge, the other Scottish players just *seem* better :)|pg||
nt|galadriel: I think N just decided he was going to be in slam when his pd showed a @S fit, and to be fair, he does have a nice hand|pg||
nt|idc: Interesting auction in other room - transfer to @s and then a forcing 3@s bid by North|pg||
nt|idc: (they transfer with 4+ suits on some hand types) - presumably that invited South to cue but he didn't, and 4@s it was|pg||
nt|pentacon: three diamonds , sry|pg||
nt|ady: not from south point of view|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: That diamond again, says Gillis to himself|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Presumably, in the other room, 4S meant somethin.  Good trumps?  Otherwise 3NT an alternative.|pg||
nt|garnetts: well the spades do let you get two tricks --not that you would look for them--but too slow anyway|pg||
nt|christinas: no, 1.3.5. against suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: but 10 can be from H109..|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mollerjep: Brøndum took the save...but then the brothers bid it!!! |pg||
nt|lestergold: in gthe old days we had the rule of what was it you had to have some playing tricks for a preempt this one has close to zero playing tricks as you have seven spade you must nake a ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade so one playinmg trick|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|lestergold: Kendrisk wants to avoid losing more than one diamond|pg||
pc|h4|nt|idc: would be good to know what 4@s meant - if good trumps North really should go on, if min and not interested ... well, North still might try|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he a small chance however line is not likely|pg||
nt|keylime: wow. did that just happen?|pg||
nt|keylime: I think declarer's got half a play for this now|pg||
pc|s7|pc|hK|nt|garnetts: @D to the 9 looks normal|pg||

nt|santyclz: I love the people who list that as 0, 2, 4.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lolol|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Operator, you sure he did not make them all?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he did, I'll give you the code for correction|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Sorry, does look like it should be 1010 in any case.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: He claimed 12 ... they are discussing it.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: E-W should give him one more|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Not if he thought his diamond suit was good.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The code is  6SS+1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Click on MOVIE, highlight 30 and overwrite|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
mb|p|nt|calabres: Yes, cause Madeira is an Portuguese Island:):)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bcallaghan: Vulnerable 5C save on this board.|pg||
nt|galadriel: I froze when we gained 10 imps!|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@S was bid in the OR and drifted two off--seems likely to be repeated |pg||
nt|joest: and it's in the evening over there right?|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|chick: anyone open the S hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 11 tricks in clubs in open but should only be ten tricks here no game|pg||
nt|santyclz: Surprised there is anyone who doesn't these days.|pg||
nt|mollerjep: they will not bid this one...|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  With Dorthe and Peter you never know...|pg||
mb|2D|nt|chick: I think it's a guess ... as Joe says you need 2 honors onside, but which two you can't tell, so mentally flip a coin for the 9 or J|pg||
nt|hedyg: 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: a grossly unsound 3s bid in front of partner im old fashioned enuf to thinh that a preempot in fornt of partner should have a vesttge of a constructive element to it|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Maybe 11|pg||
nt|lestergold: automatic i would have thought but patrick is a senior tory|pg||
nt|chick: now N thinks partner has longer spades, weaker hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: too right Chick|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 3s thye limit for them|pg||
nt|santyclz: Fit jump?|pg||
nt|lestergold: kendrick will pass|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  But I tend to agree with you|pg||
nt|christinas: once when we were young and in love I used to play with Morten and we played his system, but since I often forgot it, you probably should not listen to me too much|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT in other room    seems unlikely contract|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: 11 even|pg||
nt|lestergold: troubloe is kendrick would have passed with a slightly better hand when game was on|pg||
nt|mollerjep: and its a very lucky 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this is a brutal hand |pg||
nt|santyclz: Since it doesn't matter, take the play that gains if all 3 are on side.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: e/wat green have sopld out prematurely|pg||
nt|lestergold: partner is fraisng that preempt on laods of hands where you wont havew ap rayer inm game not to mention the openalty option s for th opponents|pg||
pc|cK|nt|keylime: the dummy is not much of comfort for declarer - the heart suit is a lacking of a fourth trump a potential bother|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would have doubled directly (lower level lesser risk after pass )|pg||
nt|mcarroll: nice balancing dbl|pg||
nt|ady: another contract with no chance|pg||
nt|lestergold: even juniotr  b ridge players have been coached out of thsi sort of nonsense|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mariner1: how to play the @S......  normally one thinks S has more dues to 3@D call|pg||
nt|chick: that's a good thought :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|garnetts: true|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|joest: yes as a passed hand, you wouldn't be overstating your values by doubling on the prior round|pg||
nt|mollerjep: as you say :-)|pg||
nt|christinas: actually, here they play 3spades as GF with 4S asking to pick a game, but because of N's distribution and many HCP, he just bid 3NT|pg||
nt|ziff: They have? Good to hear. Could you lend some of those coaches to German juniors?|pg||
nt|ady: like the 2@C overcall?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well patner oppend bidding hard to not bid ghame with north's hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: sadly not a fighting chicken not eben an apperentice kiosher chicken|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: and of course he needs to ruff out the @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: i know e/w are not vulnerable but i feel east had done en uf on his 4 count|pg||
pc|s5|nt|santyclz: Sometimes the glass *is* half full.|pg||
nt|chick: this looks to be down at least 1, maybe 2|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am not sure I like 4@D  unless it showed 5/5|pg||
nt|santyclz: Does everyone play negative x's on that auction?|pg||
nt|garnetts: double for takeout maybe|pg||
nt|santyclz: If not, 4@d is kind of forced.|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@H forcing?|pg||
nt|joest: but THE LAW commands it! :)|pg||
nt|chick: why risk pushing them to a makeable game? :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: certainly the jump to 3s put west under a lot of pressure too much to bear including the fear that a 4c bid may have driven n/s into a makeable vulnerable game|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially because he has 10xx in @H :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: i like the 3NT bid|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|santyclz: Potential beer hand.|pg||
nt|viren169: I would prefer to have a Hxx in hearts to bid 3N (rather than the T)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mcarroll: the law is an as??s|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d3|pc|s3|pg||
nt|idc: understandable doubles from NS but they won't get rich from them|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|joest: the law of total tricks|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: as these cards lie 3s may well be off as e/w have the forcing tempo|pg||
pc|c8|nt|santyclz: If that wouldn't either show 6 nor deny @ss, then y.|pg||
nt|viren169: going via 2@C would get to the same place here|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|joest: but yes I know your phrase|pg||
nt|santyclz: Tsk, tsk.|pg||
nt|lestergold: dutch coaches id recommend|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: we know which loawe u are referring to Jack!|pg||
pc|cT|nt|garnetts: Odd result on the last hand in the OR played in 1@D making 10 tricks |pg||
nt|lestergold: for msure|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Looks like an IMP or two for Schou|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe german juniors need coaches with sticks that hurt |pg||
nt|lestergold: n=but these danish seniors need them to|pg||
nt|lestergold: it seems|pg||
nt|ziff: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: too|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: martin is still a junior|pg||
nt|lestergold: i know some of my bridge is a little dated|pg||
pc|d4|nt|idc: Interesting 1@h overcall from Howard - when you play very agressive style, that hand is too good/defensive for a weak jump at these colours|pg||
nt|lestergold: patrick cant draw trump without losing control|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mariner1: averaging 8 imps a board so far..........|pg||
nt|keylime: declarer's getting frisky here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bobholl: now it may pay off :)|pg||
nt|christinas: On the hand with 4-4 fit in spades, where they went 1 down in 4 hearts, EW are in 5 clubs in the other room. It ought to make, but lets see...|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|c9|nt|keylime: and dodges a bullet.|pg||
nt|lestergold: my law of total tricks says that 4 points plus a minimum opening bid does not generally produce 9 total tricks|pg||
nt|joest: actually at these colors you get a good score for 3@h at matchpoints if they don't find the double|pg||
nt|chick: the LoTT does not say it will|pg||
nt|lestergold: Chick i know the law im just failing to be funny|pg||
nt|chick: it says that if it doesn't, the opponents have more|pg||
nt|chick: ookkkaaayyyyyyyy :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: But will it matter with e pitching all the @cs.  Still only -1.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: as lone spec says the la is about when you have about half the deck|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe west with 5 spades even tho small should not have been that scared of a spade game|pg||
nt|lestergold: but no one will convince me to openm 3s wityh tah pikle of festering old horse manure|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: decided not totake the diamond early in case of a mis defence    sort of got one    but still down 2|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|lestergold: and ui david how many loaded guins to your head to open 3s on that sort of garbage|pg||
pc|d2|nt|idc: so I'm with his 1@h - in a different partnership, it would be a 2@h bid|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: know he is 6-5 now   so K@H  easy|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|nt|santyclz: Wd,|pg||
nt|santyclz: I would expect, in a large field, that that hand would be played in 6@c several times. |pg||
nt|ady: oh dear|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|keylime: and now is down in a somewhat tricky but makeable contract|pg||
nt|mariner1: and still the average continues|pg||
nt|keylime: I think you have to assume the best there - 3/2 trumps and clubs not adverse|pg||
nt|chick: E probably expected longer spades too, and didn't imagine the forcing would work|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|pentacon: Nice save by Dorthe and Peter |pg||
mc|9|nt|ady: not my taste Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: i didnt think so dav id|pg||
nt|lestergold: nor mine not even my sons|pg||

nt|mariner1: this is the last board of this session........ next session in 21 minutes|pg||
nt|keylime: 123 imps in 15 boards is a lot|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is last hand of this set |pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks to our terrific operator in Estoril, Portugal.  Job well done Isabel! |pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to my co commentators  Joe Shair, David Carlisle and Cornelia Yoder  |pg||
nt|vugraphzmh: ty to our wonderful commentators :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to the Portugese Bridge Federation and Luis Correia for bringing this wonderful tourney to bbo. |pg||
nt|bobholl: made ???|pg||
nt|lestergold: uin any case soem miracle they made it|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  No. The first push of the match...|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board of this segment now|pg||
nt|santyclz: The failure to unblock the @ss at trick 1 cost.|pg||
nt|hedyg: our thanks to Matias Rohrberg , our outstanding operator in Copenhagen ! to my excellent fellow commentators Christina Lund Madsen, Gad Chadha and Joe Shair  for donating their ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: time to guide us through these boards! as well as to the DBF for sharing with this event with us, especially to Jens Ole Jensen and Henning Jensen who were instrumental in ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: organising these broadcasts.|pg||
nt|hedyg: no he could have played @s earlier|pg||
nt|lestergold: not even in his early junior days|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: 9 to win the first round anyone?|pg||
nt|idc: or the 10 ... 10 i think|pg||
nt|mariner1: a big THANKS! to Unknown (China), our superb operator, for doing an excellent|pg||
nt|mariner1: job!!!|pg||
nt|hedyg: special thanks to our specs for their kind and helpful messages. we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|chthonic: No, it is not related to having points.|pg||
nt|joest: south swung the ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: thks all|pg||
mb|2D|an|FG|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well nm/s overboard in open|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  A lot of IMPs have exchanged hands on some tricky boards|pg||
nt|hedyg: please join us again at 9:45 am Los Angeles, 12:45 pm New York, 18.45 Paris, 5:45 pm London|pg||
nt|lestergold: a trappy hand here|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bcallaghan: I would have tried to get to 2C with the South hand.  Maybe it's Stayman.|pg||
nt|idc: in 1NT doubled, even more fun - East leads a small @d, later run of diamonds puts West hand under some pressure|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: I think top diamond lead.|pg||
nt|sybarra: And to our specs,-- greatest audience in the world.  We appreciate you comments and thoughts|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Nah bob  1 down|pg||
nt|bobholl: still 2@S a@C 2@D |pg||
nt|joest: 5@h will not be the winner|pg||
nt|lestergold: well so far we are in a par contract a rare sight to behold in the current climate|pg||
nt|bobholl: stay fixed !!|pg||
nt|ady: 26 hcp    no game |pg||
nt|lestergold: no game |pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: as we finish up, we wish to thank the CCBA and the Shenyang Bridge Association for this event|pg||
nt|joest: cash is still just as good now as it was on board 9 :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is 3d?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Fit bid presumably|pg||
nt|lestergold: if i was his partner i would certainly have a fit|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  This board is a potential swing for Schaltz as Schou-BrÃ¸ndum got to 3NT as NS and lost the obvious 5 tricks|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: Right, they could easily be running|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And if not, still hope that @SK is an entry|pg||
nt|idc: true, but that takes away the fun, just a boring -1 i think|pg||
nt|mariner1: many thanks to all the organizers and sponsors, the CBF and all for helping BBO|pg||
nt|mariner1: bring us the vugraphs!|pg||
nt|keylime: also, a big thanks to my tag team partner, Rob Brown, from the Pacific NW|pg||
nt|calabres: We will return in about 15/20 min, ty|pg||
nt|sybarra: we will be back after a short break |pg||
nt|santyclz: And thanks to Shirley as well.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Fourth suit forcing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Thanks everyone |pg||
nt|lestergold: yeh normality afrrives on board 16!!|pg||
nt|mollerjep: but a very exiting set of boards...and I guees this will be tight all the way|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Dbl??|pg||
nt|lestergold: but casnt blame them for bidding one|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bcallaghan: West may still be squeezed.|pg||
nt|idc: looks like SOuth could pass to get a forced XX, then run to 2@c to show 5|pg||
nt|idc: no idea either why he didn't|pg||
nt|keylime: to Roland our fearless leader of all things vugraph|pg||
nt|mariner1: thank you Dwayne|pg||
nt|ady: best is 10 tricks in diamonds     bound to reach game|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: to Fred, our patron of bridge|pg||
nt|pentacon: øhh|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  He knows they have a 11 card diamond fit|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  and that partner has a (sub)minimum opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Clearly an unjustifiable overbid without the @d7.|pg||
nt|christinas: see you all, looks to be a close and exciting finish|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes should be fun!|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: SYT will be feeling really good heading into the finals I think|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  It is clearly T/O, but still a little strange|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: on backwards heart hook it can make|pg||
nt|lestergold: but why should he find that|pg||
nt|ziff: No w he has to get @Hs right to succeed|pg||
nt|ady: only reach chance for n/s  is a low heart lead  and play low from the south hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a bit doubl dummjy n ot absurd|pg||
pc|c5|nt|garnetts: much more competitive here than in the OR|pg||
nt|chick: hehe|pg||
nt|lestergold: well how on earth a hand bristling with queens and jacks found anything more than a courtesy raise puzzles me|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a guess|pg||
pc|c4|nt|joest: so this will wind up as a 1 imp differential to Lara|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bcallaghan: Provided declarer plays spades - one down.|pg||
nt|galadriel: Strange..partners don't like it when you squeeze them...and like it less when you endplay them!|pg||
nt|mariner1: we end on what appears to be a quiet board...........|pg||
nt|hedyg: hard to read 8@s|pg||
pc|d2|nt|idc: I suppose 4 hcp opposite 15-17, gamble on it making isn't so weird, down in the match etc|pg||
nt|keylime: they capitalized on a lot of errors,and for the most part stayed out of trouble|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  And our 2nd push of the match|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: yes    could still make|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|sybarra: K!!!|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|lestergold: unhlucky i agree to fuind that his sole valuable asset his stiff club is opposite patrick's acerlessside suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: acerlessside|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mike inventing new words all the time|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry arseless|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear i mean aceless|pg||
nt|santyclz: We're trying to develop a new word for Chick to liscence.|pg||
nt|lestergold: Kendrick inventing new bids akll the time i only words|pg||
nt|viren169: probably safe to duck|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|lestergold: no its not the onkly chance|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a heart view|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h5|pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: and a slight odds in favour of the backward finesse|pg||
nt|ady: crazy discard|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|chick: This is the last board of this match.   I want to thank our excellent vugraph operator, Isabel Correia, for a great job!  :)|pg||
nt|ziff: At the other table East lead a @H, but N did not play low from dummy|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h2|nt|santyclz: Cash the @sa before taking the ruff?|pg||
nt|viren169: nicely played in clubs|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|bobholl: !next as joey always says|pg||
nt|joest: i think next means manana|pg||
nt|joest: or next round|pg||
nt|joest: b/c this was the last board I think|pg||
nt|bobholl: 8 boards isn't much :)|pg||
nt|joest: it'll have to do|pg||
nt|chick: one more round I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzmh: We will be back shortly ... ty all|pg||
nt|joest: ok thanks all|pg||
nt|joest: great job operator!|pg||
nt|bobholl: ty too !!! very well done :)|pg||
nt|joest: time for some more Madeira!|pg||
nt|vugraphzmh: last round for tonight will start in 15min time ... tomorrow we will be back with another 3 rounds|pg||
nt|chthonic: thanks, all|pg||
pc|d8|nt|idc: Heh, your partner opens the bidding, you double 1NT and take 7 tricks in your own hand...|pg||
nt|lestergold: but wont hurt becasuse declafrer has used up his commincation cards |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|viren169: all for a flat board!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|idc: and the ox opposite takes none :)|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks also to my wonderful fellow commentators, Joe Shair and Mike Gold, for their witty and superb commentary!   |pg||
nt|chick: And of course to the Portuguese Bridge Federation and BBO Roland Wald for bring this to you.|pg||
nt|chick: Another match in about 15 minutes, see you all there!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks all, see you in a few minutes.|pg||
