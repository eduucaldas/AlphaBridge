nt|vugraphzmr: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: My Co-commentators are David Collier, Catherine Draper and Mark Horton and I am Geoffrey Wolfarth |pg||
nt|dburn: not much of an opening bid, those North cards, but these days almost anything goes|pg||

nt|sybarra: hi all |pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: hi good evening everyone |pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|athene: club lead will get the defence off to a good start|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi stephen - do we know the systems in use?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: not off hand...|pg||
nt|pkl: Okay... the first board. I just realise we are quite a small bunch. 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stayman was not out of the question|pg||
nt|athene: not only is it safe, but east gets to make two discards which might be helpful|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you were right in a way about the auction Bill. it was passed out. after the opening bid, that is :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes, stayman was a possibility with the north hand (intending to pass any rebid from opener)|pg||
nt|dburn: 1NT alerted - may be forcing, I guess, but about 2@c I am not sure|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: south is bidding a lot|pg||
nt|eggy: Just when West thought it was starting to look good|pg||
nt|henryb: then 2@h = pass or correct|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe South thinks it's a transfer and North doesn't|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case the final contract could be somewhat less than elegant|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Your commentators are Marshall Lewis and William Frisby|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@S looks makeable|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Player names please operator|pg||
nt|athene: south has a very nice hand, even if she doesn't have a name yet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: usually they make it through a few hands before they play anonymously|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a LOT off|pg||
nt|eggy: quite a poor bid by east on reflection|pg||
nt|sybarra: can the slam be bid?  |pg||
nt|sharkirl: Hi shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: guess not |pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Michael |pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: i can think of people who would open 2@C on that south hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi Catherine, Steve, Calle and Geoffrey. Havee fun :)|pg||
nt|dburn: not that there's much wrong with 2@d as a contract, but not by North-South|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  a bit of a push|pg||
pc|h4|nt|idc: Morning Peter, morning everyone|pg||
nt|pkl: So we ended in 3@C - sensible bidding everywhere|pg||
nt|pkl: Good morning Ian|pg||
nt|idc: This is a more open Lady Milne than for years, so I'm looking forward to an exciting day of bridge|pg||
nt|pkl: I might as S be tempted to bid 3@H - that singleton club looks really nice|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rnc: Hi|pg||
nt|eggy: west almost guaranteed to hold 5 spade|pg||
nt|henryb: indeed: favorable breaks in all suits and @hA well placed|pg||
nt|mamos: whereas 1Nt would make so Catherine North has done well|pg||
nt|dburn: however, they seem to be on track|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.cbai.ie/documents/LadyMilneScoreboard1.pdf  for results and standing after round 3|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi roland will do|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: a feisty auction and i am not sure whether this will be an objectively good result for the declaring side|pg||
nt|col3435: yes, how does 4@h do?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|dburn: this ought not to make, but with the favourable red suit position East-West could make about 2NT, so no great harm done|pg||
nt|sharkirl: quick clain when Sq appears|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S plays well. but 1NT can make also|pg||
nt|col3435: seems to me like it might come in|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|athene: yes, there is the double heart finesse for declarer if she chooses to take it|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: still, not so obvious for West to play a red suit ace now, which is what she needs to do|pg||
nt|dburn: although I guess @d3 might also work|pg||
nt|dburn: and might be more accurate defence|pg||
nt|dburn: the point being that by playing diamonds twice more, West can in effect create a trump trick for herself|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: E's puny spade suit probably touted her off the slam |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it may well but will e/w get there in the other room? n/s bidding i think helped|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dburn: but now she really does need to play a diamond, and not...|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dburn: ...a spade|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rnc: South was quite happy I suppose when seeing dummy with 5 spades|pg||
nt|dburn: now, provided Cath Jagger takes the right view of the clubs, she can succeed|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|col3435: I'd say West always had enough to bid 4@h after East had raised|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Let's suppose North cashed a top club and then switched to the jack of diamonds - quite testing for declarer then |pg||
nt|sybarra: checking the @D break  |pg||

nt|sn00py27: hi|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@H looks normal|pg||
nt|henryb: Mike. May your addition errors make little difference and your spelling be reasonable|pg||
nt|lestergold: no chanse of that Hnry and 2+2=5 in my maths |pg||
nt|Walddk4: I have more than 700|pg||

mb|1H|nt|lestergold: hi Roland and all |pg||
nt|sn00py27: hi|pg||
nt|henryb: your favorite 20-20, Roland|pg||
mb|2H|nt|idc: Redbl here is I think a single suited rescue|pg||
nt|pkl: North has a difficult decision here - double or show hearts. No macro could solve that one, Roland|pg||
nt|idc: West will bid 2@c and East then reveals her suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: most likely a @c raise |pg||
nt|sybarra: also exploring for nt,  but 3nt be 1 too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwww|pg||
nt|athene: although if north leads her partner's suit that will help|pg||
nt|athene: ouch|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: very hard to disagnose though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E took a real chance here...|pg||
nt|ady: tranfer to hearts     likely down 2 at 2 level|pg||
nt|dburn: may be one major, rather than a transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north was doing the thinking :) i doubt east had to think too hard about that one|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure the auction should be taking this long|pg||
nt|dburn: not particularly sound whatever it is, mind|pg||
nt|dburn: still, no one can ever double anyone for penalties nowadays|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnc: This one will for sure be cheaper|pg||
nt|henryb: you are obviously not an accountant.|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i do have an oxford maths degree if it was cambrisge then id be able to add up|pg||
nt|henryb: Pender thinks she has died and gone to heaven|pg||
nt|lestergold: in oxford they only taught me how to punt|pg||
nt|mamos: horses or skiffs?|pg||
nt|henryb: there is a story of the CEO who wanted to find out what 2+2=|pg||
nt|henryb: He called in his economists. they said 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: without birth control 2+2 can equal quite a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i might have bid something over 1@C as east|pg||
nt|sybarra: although, might have the timing on a @H lead |pg||
pc|h4|nt|sn00py27: I thought we might get an idea on this hand whether they play weak or strong NT :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In these times many East's would open - especially with an eye on the vulnerability|pg||
nt|sn00py27: E/W|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this should be easy enough|pg||
nt|idc: I think I like 2NT by South now - she has a little too much to give up on game|pg||
nt|pkl: 3NT really sounds like "STOP". Can West find the diamond lead?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: probably better to play in 7D. at least you go off only one when diamonds break your heart|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D must be showing something like north's hand - and south ought to be getting mildly excited|pg||
nt|col3435: some convention cards at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/lmteams.htm|pg||
nt|col3435: N/S play "Acol with 5-card majors and a strong NT"|pg||
nt|col3435: E/W card isn't there but I think they play strong+5 too|pg||
nt|sn00py27: Not quite Acol then !|pg||
nt|ady: this wont make    but n/s likely to make 8 tricks in 1NT|pg||
nt|idc: ok, or that gets the job done even more easily :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: the aces will take care of partner's @H+@C losers, however those two cards are split|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|col3435: well, yes. Seems like a contradiction in terms to me. But that's what they say.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: @SJ10 might be useful fillers...@DAK9 is great|pg||
nt|henryb: he did not like that, so he called in his information tech people. wait a moment they said, we will check on the computer|pg||
nt|pkl: Oh - no reason to worry. I bet we'll have eleven tricks in the sack in no time.|pg||
nt|idc: A pity that we didn't get a chance to see if West would find @d lead v3NT, Q best perhaps|pg||
nt|pkl: That is a nice lead ... looks as if i holds N to ten tricks|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: understandable that NS are hoping to create some action given the match score. but that 5C bid is infinitely more likely to widen the gap than to close it|pg||
nt|athene: East will be disappointed to get only her top trumps from here|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|sybarra: immediate @D hook |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: admittedly you don't want to bid a grand slam when there is a chance they might not reach the small slam in the other room|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, so down two may show a profit, but there are easier ways to make a living|pg||
pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: i am puzzled why N did not respond 2D|pg||
nt|athene: a 6-card minor is shorter than a 5-card major, for most people, these days|pg||
nt|col3435: (it probably just means "not 2/1 GF")|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: i am sorry to say|pg||
nt|eggy: good defence|pg||
nt|henryb: back they came. 4 they said|pg||
nt|lestergold: good start for Catherine|pg||
nt|henryb: he did not like that, so he called in the accountants|pg||
nt|lestergold: east may well be endoplayed more times thanm she likes for her visit to heavan|pg||
nt|henryb: What would you like it to be, they asked? :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: EW would probably get another trick if W continued spades, but that is not too likely|pg||
pc|d9|nt|marlowepi: but there is more to it than that. 2D has the advantage of announcing strength immediately also|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: i think with all those keycards for diamonds, south should not stop below 6@D after north bids 4@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suppose N was concerned about a rebid of 2H from S. but is 2D GF ion their methods? not normally in these countries, is it?|pg||
nt|athene: well, i don't know N-S's methods, but i am assuming Acol-ish, so things tend not to be forcing :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think both N and S are guilty of underbidding here|pg||
nt|sybarra: and grabbing the 9 tricks |pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: that is the humnan reality, true, though in international matches one is more or less expected to overcome those foibles|pg||
nt|mamos: i think the hand was played rotated so op had problems  as it seems did the players and commentators|pg||
nt|mugsmate: That sort of multi makes me feel old. Routine when I was at university 15 years ago.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You are lucky, it makes *me* feel sick|pg||
nt|mugsmate: First in at favourable vulnerability is a good time to be a bit random, so long as your partner knows not to punish you.|pg||
nt|ady: if they get the club suit right then 3T will make|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: alerted as weak major, max 7pts|pg||
nt|mugsmate: The multi may be just what is required to protect that club queen.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that Multi may cause declarer not to get clubs right|pg||
nt|ady: Jagger may sacrifice in 4@H|pg||
nt|idc: - bottom right of screen button - and see how the boards play out there|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is not a slam,  e/w in game in major,  sac in @D for n/s?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: N should not have that worry when S cues 5C|pg||
nt|roswolf: will south fancy this hand?|pg||
nt|sharkirl: 4s |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would be tempted to bid 2@C over 1@H with East |pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT overcall?|pg||
nt|henryb: over an opening 1@s do you overcall 1N or double and bid 2N|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT for me|pg||
nt|sn00py27: opp passed hand I am happy to settle with 1NT|pg||
nt|henryb: I think I would double and bid 2N actually|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: east doubled 1@D intending to bid spades next and show a strong hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has announced a strong NT, and six is cold facing both round aces and diamond KQ, which is only 13|pg||
nt|chessmaste: South might protect |pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be finis|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1nt not unreasonable all acions are going to be distorted with this hand|pg||
nt|sn00py27: but I would do something with S - unless they play 2@C as conventional and she has no easy bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1n is the closest|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Just 3H. If you play this random style, you have to play it as a PARTNERSHIP. Jagger can't go to 4H when partner may be so weak.|pg||
nt|ady: 4H could be 500 or 800 |pg||
nt|dburn: trouble is, she still doesn't know which major her partner has|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: she doesn't really want her next decision to be selecting a lead to 1@DX|pg||
nt|athene: it's a pretty good suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: she appears to|pg||
nt|dburn: if it turns out to be spades, 4@s might even be making|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Interestingly, north has shown 4-4 in the majors and south has shown 5 hearts, so there is no real reason to get the clubs wrong anymore.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: south should bid 2c surely|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: i wouldn;t need to be tempted. i would do it before temptation even arose|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i would not like to play the n/s hands at the 3 level but maybe that is why i am commentating these days|pg||
nt|henryb: yes, or double 1N would be my choice|pg||
nt|idc: All roads seem to lead to 3NT making here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: hmmm this auction seems illogical|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Enterprising and unlucky to find partner with most of her points in spades|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: i assume West in fact didn't pass|pg||
nt|sn00py27: should make 3@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: she has the theoretical values for a double but hand is too top heavy for it for my liking|pg||
nt|mamos: Pass would be a field if partner had psyched|pg||
nt|henryb: partner is third hand at favorable ...|pg||
nt|idc: I guess 6@d is playable but a bit ambitious|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No, it's mainly because you are not a woman|pg||
nt|roswolf: east has saved the opps bacon|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They won't allow you in even if you shave, Geoffrey|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it is probably getting tken out as indeed it was and then u have to show trhis limite dhand at the 3 level|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: either South or West probably bid 1@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you dont want a spade lead from Txxxx or some rubbish against 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: presumably south denied 4 spades by bidding 2nt|pg||
nt|sn00py27: as 8 counts go - it is quite decent|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes has the 2 extra 9's|pg||
nt|lestergold: even more reason to bid a quiet 2 clubs|pg||
nt|mamos: i like 2C because if partner is light you have tolerance for @S and no great harm is done|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate this hand was always likely to finish where it has|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: maybe N simply did the multiplication and made the bid that would complete the equation|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3@H I don't care for|pg||
nt|chessmaste: or 3@S|pg||
nt|sn00py27: me neither, was thinking of passing back to partner or 2NT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: well, good old partner found a club lead anyway :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 3@S was very hasty|pg||
nt|col3435: yes it ought to be possible for N/S to scramble to their best fit after the Dbl|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3@S has two chances - slim and none|pg||
nt|col3435: but evidently a confident 3@h has its merits|pg||
nt|lestergold: and its infrangible|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Key moment|pg||
nt|ady: a lot of imps here|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Seems that only if south is exactly 3541 or 2551 does south have a singleton club. There are more shapes where south has 2 clubs.|pg||
nt|pkl: I don't find it obvious that you end in 3NT. 5@D looks also reasonable to me. |pg||
pc|c3|nt|henryb: I prefer impregnable|pg||
nt|pkl: ... or 4@S ;-)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: and 1NT or 2NT is a likely enough rebid for S|pg||
nt|ady: roof falls in|pg||
nt|pkl: Much more interesting than 3NT!|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: 2 of @H for the club lead |pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: a new one but be careful Henry some of these ladies are quite young |pg||
pc|cT|nt|roswolf: it is not devoid of hope - defence may assist|pg||
nt|rnc: Due to the CC, a direct 2NT would have been xfer to @D - so this will presumably be their way to invite "1NT-2NT"|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: why didn't south rebid 1@S?|pg||
mc|10|nt|sybarra: a likely push |pg||

nt|eggy: at least on the 800 hand - Stockdale bid the making game (5D)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: an awful lot of slams in this set already. what's up with that? a spec asked if this is goulasch LOL|pg||
nt|athene: Multi-2@D; east might try 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb: a bad unbiddable 3N?|pg||
nt|henryb: that happens to make|pg||
nt|ady: a diamond slam for e/w|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Six diamonds by east is a great spot here - the play complicated by the unlucky 3-0 trump break.|pg||
nt|ady: if they get the diamond right|pg||
nt|pkl: I also thought about 3NT on last deal, Ian - but I was a little bit uncertain as to whether it was for NS or for EW ;-)|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: now this could be fun|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 16 +8 will they bid 3NT?|pg||
nt|pkl: A very nice 6@H... should be easy to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: an awful lot of slam bidding, and vice versa :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: looks like the Multi. either that or everybody has a fatal attraction for the 2D card in the bidding box (as did S on the previous hand)|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D is certainly spades but hard to be sure what strength it shows|pg||
nt|athene: there are several schemes for rebids here, and west might be cautiously treating it as minimum or optimistically treating it as maximium|pg||
nt|rnc: And if bid and made twice, it'll be... 800 :)|pg||
nt|dburn: unlucky start to the auction - will now play the wrong way round for the Burn Percentage Play to work|pg||
nt|ady: if south does not lead a club   can make even mis guessing the diamond|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will be a scramble |pg||
pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: 5C may not be a great idea when one opp has passed and your partner has not|pg||
nt|petepunt:  evening all|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi peter|pg||
nt|petepunt:  hi we know the pairs|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: 2@D = multi or weak 2 diamonds?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: @D|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty|pg||
nt|eggy: If she'd tried 6, she'd have made that too I suppose|pg||
nt|dburn: however, after this start they may reach only 3NT anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: but East has done well|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|idc: We don't have a CC for NS so we can try to guess their system as the match developes|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: i think north could afford to take it a bit slower|pg||
nt|athene: one opponent has passed|pg||
nt|athene: and you have a fair amount in the majors|pg||
nt|eggy: unless West leads a spade|pg||
nt|sn00py27: 1nt - 3NT ?|pg||
nt|henryb: at most 2N|pg||
nt|dburn: West has plenty of extra playing strength, but no really convenient way to show it|pg||
nt|mugsmate: I agree east hass done well, but a byproduct of 3S is that south may well lead a club now.|pg||
nt|idc: My first guess is that they play splinters :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: tracy is in aggressive mood today|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: @CAK @DAK for the defence here, and they don't have to find them right away|pg||
nt|athene: although they do have to be a little bit careful|pg||
nt|lestergold: combined 24 good intermediates 3n a fair shot and it makes comfortably on any lead|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: and it's game-all - opps aren't at favourable or anything scary like that|pg||
nt|dburn: well, they are in six now|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sn00py27: East's bidding on this hand has worked well|pg||
nt|chessmaste: They have done well - hardly obvious to insist on game facing a weak two in diamonds|pg||
nt|sn00py27: good start|pg||
nt|lestergold: north should go|pg||
nt|dburn: or very shortly|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: well they sort of do, after AK of clubs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pkl: I believe you are right... and some kind of Blackwood?|pg||
nt|idc: I think we are getting there gradually|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|rnc: Yes|pg||
nt|idc: I like North's actions - not quite worth more than 4@h after the splinter in AKQx suit|pg||
nt|pkl: I would have been much weaker bidding 4@D - perhaps it is some "double strength" type of cue|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|henryb: look how bad this 3N is: needs both black suits to run and not to lose 4@d and the @sA|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: yes, they do now|pg||
nt|lestergold: its far from throw against wall but i think that its a vulnerable game that should be bid|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dburn: one indication may come if South leads @c10, though - short clubs implies long diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: excellent slam  will be unlucky to go down|pg||
nt|idc: but it is very close - she has a bit more than minimum opener|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|sn00py27: v poor until everything breaks :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe better low @S first?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Henry Bethe|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: could @DA and another ever be wrong?|pg||
nt|lestergold: its thinnish but tghe intermediates create additional chances as here with clubs breaking 4/2 but the ten of clubs to the rescue etc|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade intermediates good- dims can b e blocked or notm led when they are 5/3|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would want to be in this game|pg||
nt|henryb: It is about 50% for each black suit. so both is 25%. you have some other chances but not many|pg||
nt|dburn: well, I would go down for sure, but East may draw the right inference|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Perhaps east will deduce the lead is from shortage, so cater to trump length with the leader.|pg||
nt|sybarra: didnt that take entry out of dummy?|pg||

nt|idc: I see on board 2, Scotland played 3NT and Ireland found the @d lead, so 13 IMPs to them|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D looks like DONT |pg||
nt|sybarra: @D and higher suit |pg||
nt|henryb: is 2@d @d and another or a transfer?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure|pg||
nt|sharkirl: multilandy?|pg||
nt|henryb: maybe our operator can tell us?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|henryb: that is a sound 2@s overcall|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: we need an undo? - 2@C from East, rather than South|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that sort of thing doesnt usually happen in the first half of the set|pg||
nt|athene: stayman now, and pass 2@H?|pg||
nt|rnc: Yes, you're quite right , Catherine. South will either be squeezed or, if playing !K, East will set up a @D-trick|pg||
nt|rnc: !K = @DK :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: N might believe the 7 card @S suit=  trumps|pg||
nt|henryb: I would NOT double 2@s with only three trumps|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is it "cards"  top of bid?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not my X either|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: sorry about connection problems|pg||
nt|henryb: E-W make 2N or 3@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: not only is 3h icy but on a spade lead 4h is cold|pg||
nt|mamos: im told South made 2@H +2 on Board 5 we missed|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: i would bid 2@H over 1@H with the north hand|pg||
nt|petepunt:  prefer 6@H for that|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North gets lucky|pg||
nt|idc: North never managed to get her AJTxxx suit in at all in the auction|pg||
nt|ahh: now north should bid 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt:  6nt on board 2 was tough to make|pg||
nt|petepunt:  NI pair in OR possibly most experienced in event|pg||
nt|athene: i admit the north heart holding, whilst strong, isn't ideal -  you don't have a tenace where you can exploit being over the known length|pg||
nt|athene: but even so, the hand is good enough that i would get in there|pg||
nt|petepunt:  bur I would balance with 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: if south now avoids the heart lead   will be more difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not as big a problem as South would have|pg||
nt|dburn: better undo this auction|pg||
nt|mugsmate: needs a pass inserted, vugraph operator:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt:  9 tricks again -  but i was wrong last time :)|pg||
nt|henryb: Punch is having none of thei at Red|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: a very comfortable contract here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: who put dummy down?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Suit quality is a factor for some players|pg||
nt|roswolf: provoking opps to bid a game which they might not have reached unaided is the downside of such pre-empts|pg||
nt|sn00py27: not to mention the 500 that was on offer from 4@H :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: True, but assuming South would have opened 1@D game was sure to be reached|pg||
nt|roswolf: a more telling point catherine!|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Hard to double 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: in my view east should bid 3h over 2s- amaybe a slight overbid but she is under pressure and partner needs to know how good those hearst are|pg||
nt|lestergold: partner knows that she is under pressure|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n is appaling|pg||
nt|henryb: I do not agree. she is at least an ace light for 3@h|pg||
nt|ady: best lead|pg||
pc|s4|nt|diumraid: ****  LIVE  IN RUNNING from LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  N-IRELAND 58, SCOTLAND 52, IRELAND 48, ENGLAND 44, CBAI 42,  WALES 26  *****|pg||
nt|dburn: ought to lead a low heart rather than an honour if she leads one at all, but this diamond may well prove effective|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: with thin stops double was unwise|pg||
nt|ahh: but like all players cant resist the lure of 3nt |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|pkl: Yes. But finding the diamond lead as east is quite easy. Here West would have had the problem.|pg||
nt|idc: true Peter|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos: to be fair strong suits in weak hands can be dificult  I think East has shown her hand well|pg||
nt|lestergold: pushing them to 4h which as we can see cn make on a spade lead|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Good lead - partner hadn't doubled stayman & the opponents have a major each...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chessmaste: We will soon be on to the next deal now|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 2 or 3 down|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: well now will east play the courageous and only line to make|pg||
nt|henryb: I think 4@h is cold on any lead, Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: u dont double one game in ordeer to push them into one u cant double|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes u are right henry |pg||
nt|sn00py27: that J@C onside will allow a discard whatever the lead I think|pg||
nt|ahh: play of this is routine   lets discuss the weather |pg||

nt|pkl: Its raining here, so I'd call it irish weather ;-)|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|Walddk7: The lady on lead|pg||
nt|henryb: boring hand. eventually declarer will come to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sharkirl: yes|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|henryb: and I think N was wrong to double 3N, a contract she thinks she can beat|pg||
nt|lestergold: dims cant be enjoyed thru comunications lack|pg||
nt|sn00py27: I would have sat happily defending 3NT as North :)|pg||
nt|henryb: no more; no less|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe an up trick? |pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: i think "9 tricks" is a safer prediction this board|pg||
nt|Walddk7: She thought she was dummy|pg||
nt|ahh: Sam Punch has become one of Scotlands most thoughtful players |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: why duck and let thyem attack diamonds|pg||
nt|idc: I'm guessing that's a euphemism|pg||
nt|henryb: not a chance|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: Victor @H@H|pg||
nt|henryb: Hi Victor|pg||
nt|sybarra: where have you been???|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sharkirl: Hi Victor|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sn00py27: good effort the 10@S - they can see those clubs setting up|pg||
nt|mamos: better to double 3NT if you think you can beat 4@H :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry folks but this hand is one error after another ladies getting tired|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: i remember one time i was playing in a local duplicate and partner was on lead|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|dburn: may be down only one - can endplay either opponent, but not for nine tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hi henry shirley michael|pg||
pc|c6|nt|henryb: Just in time to finish a hand that was more interesting in the bidding than in the play|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: and looked enquiringly at me (as in, to see if i had any questions)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this line by declarer is not so precise|pg||
nt|athene: and i said "small please, partner" without thinking|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||

nt|athene: until it's right!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well, maybe North won't open that hand next time|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes "very comfortable" contracts just don;t fetch|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Aggressive bidding is a good tactic if your declarer play has the gift of squeezing the extra trick out of things|pg||
nt|chessmaste: This might be interesting|pg||
nt|eggy: as the natural think would be to take the losing spade view|pg||

nt|idc: I think I have a line like that in my references:|pg||
nt|idc: His capacity for prolonged periods of thoughful reflection in the afternoon will amaze you|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and if north bids spades enthusiastically, that can only help west|pg||
nt|athene: variable NT for N-S|pg||
nt|col3435: is West worth a double of 1@h, do you think?|pg||
nt|eggy: and get a club switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt:  1@S will do here|pg||
nt|lestergold: that case is best forgotten quickly Mike|pg||
nt|mamos: might even be passed out|pg||
nt|henryb: E-W have more high cards but no suits and no tricks; N-S have suits but no fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not a hand for anyone to make anything|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chessmaste: Not for me - and it will give the game away here |pg||
nt|pkl: Can you hear the snore? ;-)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: west of course doesn't expect that her partner has so little wasted in spades|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt would have worked out fine as well, even though they are off the club suit|pg||
nt|ady: can make 2@H  |pg||
mb|p|nt|diumraid: Current in Running Scores are as follows  N-IRELAND  19,  ENGLAND  16,   IRELAND  16,  SCOTLAND 14, CBAI 14, WALES  11|pg||
nt|col3435: a spade lead might also give the game away|pg||
nt|sybarra: can probably get coffee,   |pg||
pc|cT|nt|petepunt:  3@S was possible with 2 aces,  but a bit thin for a slam try|pg||
nt|chessmaste: West will have an awkward lead against 4@H|pg||
nt|sn00py27: very dangerous with 4333|pg||
nt|mamos: are NS too high already?|pg||
nt|lestergold: that case may end up with fornsic investigators in the cold case files|pg||
nt|henryb: the club lead will give away one trick, and eventually declarer will lead to the @hK for a seventh|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: they will play 4@S now and just lose @H @C @C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this deal looks like a 2-bid auction to me|pg||
nt|ahh: my friend Jules suggests its all part of a cunning plan  if you wait 5 mins before bidding or play the (lady ) opps begin mentally writing shopping lists  and before you all ...|pg||
nt|ahh: complain about sexism Jules (very nice LADY ) says is it gameswomanship |pg||
nt|idc: Peter and I are too afraid to comment|pg||
nt|ahh: when i am the victim i begin to think about important things like beer and football |pg||
nt|pkl: I would say that statement of Jim was a most sexist one...|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sn00py27: I wd probably fish out the 4 @S - not a success here |pg||
nt|lestergold: well maybe they are but they havent done anything wrong yet|pg||
nt|dburn: or beat 1NT a trick - not perhaps altogether wise for South to volunteer to play the hand rather than defend it|pg||
nt|ahh: coward |pg||
nt|pkl: ... but for the fact that it is probably true ;-)|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|col3435: I'd have the @s4 on the table in a flash, and declarer would be very grateful|pg||
nt|sn00py27: not sure our support for the lead will make West feel any better !|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In one sense North did well not to respond 1@S  |pg||
pc|sT|nt|tejjyid: this looks safe enough - time for a quick cuppa|pg||
nt|dburn: but whether South or West bid 1NT, East was going to venture 2@h anyway|pg||
nt|idc: I was expecting a pass there, but EW seem determined not to miss any games|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petepunt:  predict 13?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: with the NOrth cards opposite a 15-17 NT, 3NTdirectly is tempting|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: what does 2c mean?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 2d?|pg||
nt|sn00py27: puppet to 2@D which you can pass if weak with @D|pg||
nt|henryb: transfer to 2@d; start of possibly invitational sequences|pg||
nt|mamos: i think this is a good piece of convention but not sure Souths hand is suitable|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah hah|pg||
nt|sn00py27: or make invitational bids - 2@D over 1NT would be GF|pg||
nt|mamos: gladiator|pg||
nt|lestergold: but what is wrong with 1n soutgh is not weak|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|henryb: by a passed hand perhaps not the best use of the bids|pg||
nt|idc: they may miss some plus scores in partscore, but no games|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahh: they may go minus a lot too |pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: 1n struggles mainly because of bad break in dimaonds! |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: certainly 13 now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|eggy: not Mike Lawrences view though|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: by which same token 8 tricks in diamonds becomes a tall order|pg||
nt|pkl: A tough lady, Mrs. Punch... |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|idc: mind you, on this layout and lead they have some play|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In some book I suggested a lead from a king was very dangerous - and a trump was also bad - plus underleading an ace was out of the question|pg||
nt|ahh: i can see 8  wheres theres 8 a 9th may appear |pg||
pc|c4|nt|sn00py27: maybe in pairs ok, but too dangerous for me at imps|pg||
pc|h3|nt|idc: good switch from North|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: spade switch neede to cut off heart trick|pg||
nt|henryb: much as I love aces, I might not open the N hand|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|sybarra: now what  ace and @C ? |pg||
nt|sybarra: or H!?|pg||
nt|sybarra: *@H?|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|idc: Oh, forgot about the 2@c overcall - still well done to her anyway|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|lestergold: Henry with the greatest respect failure tio open a hand containing 3 aces is a hanging offence in these parts|pg||
nt|dburn: but declarer is giving herself plenty to do here, though she will probably survive|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: sometimes it is good to use conventions in close decisions, as it keeps you from forgetting them|pg||
nt|eggy: I think there is ahand where you get this auction and x with 4(@S)333 ..|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dT|pg||
nt|ahh: might as well pressure south before playing @S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: of course if you are worried partner is on the point of forgetting them, you have a knife-edge decision|pg||
nt|tejjyid: also if u r tired & emotional, process may be better than judgement|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Good! Going to Sanremo?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: use them to jog his memory, or avoid them in case he forgets? :)|pg||

nt|idc: A 5@c opening would have been interesting - raising to 6@c would have been possible then?|pg||
nt|pkl: I believe there are thirteen tricks in a spade-contract|pg||
nt|henryb: I think that is within range|pg||
nt|sybarra: so in their range |pg||
nt|sharkirl: trouble here?|pg||
nt|henryb: North will bid. the question is what|pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks like trouble for either side |pg||
mb|2H|an|H + MINOR|nt|roswolf: 6@D might well be on here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: 4@H or 3NT  good for E-W here but not trivial to reach|pg||
nt|petepunt:  west worth a raise  to 3@Hat some stage|pg||
nt|eggy: My copy ofhis book seems to have gone AWOL, so I am afraid I can't reference it|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@h probably = @h and a minor|pg||
nt|sybarra: if 2 @H is @h and minor,  S may bid 2 nt for the minor |pg||
nt|henryb: we will know shortly|pg||
nt|sybarra: "systems on" over interference or ???|pg||
nt|sybarra: I.e.,  being able to ask for minor?|pg||
nt|henryb: not over 2@h. not sensible|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is 3 @C pass or correct?  (which I doubt) |pg||
nt|henryb: might be|pg||
mb|3C|an|PASS OR CORRECT|nt|lestergold: but was it well defended?|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: 3nt just needs 4-3 spades or no spade lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: aha|pg||
nt|sharkirl: very flat match so far, all but 1 a push|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: we have an extra pass in here, operator|pg||
nt|athene: need undo|pg||
nt|ahh: live by the sword  die by it |pg||
nt|pkl: Yes - I would open 5@C and raise to 6. Unless I saw both hands at once|pg||
nt|ahh: 6 is a reasonable bid in isolation |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the barrage will make things difficult|pg||
nt|pkl: 6C could win, I believe?|pg||
nt|idc: in isolation from the actual auction?   B->|pg||
nt|ahh: some bizarre trump reduction coup thingy |pg||
nt|pkl: Just ruff a lot of cards ... I believe the incomes are there|pg||
nt|idc: You guys are right I believe|pg||
nt|ahh: the only alternative is to play for singleton @C honour or KQ stiff|pg||
nt|idc: but hard for declarer not to just rely on single honour|pg||
nt|ahh: so west may find it |pg||
nt|pkl: Right. But I admit a lot of stuff would have to go well with the trump-reduction plan as well |pg||
nt|pkl: ... and it requires a little help from opps (the @D lead)|pg||
nt|ahh: ok  so you open 4@C  what does 4nt mean ?  what does 4@S mean    have you discussed them  does anybody ?|pg||
nt|ahh: 1 should ask for trump quality |pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: well, this is fair enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: many pairs have ways to distinguish a good 2H raise from a nuisance raise over doublke|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H might be a much weaker hand - it would be useful to have 2@D available as a good 3-card raise|pg||
nt|petepunt:  2@d best used as a 8-10 3 card raise|pg||
nt|tejjyid: My least favourite standard auction|pg||
nt|tejjyid: SOuth's pass is very conservative |pg||
nt|athene: i wouldn't be happy as south about never showing the most important feature of my hand - my spade fit|pg||
nt|eggy: 4@S is doubled on 21 in the closed|pg||
nt|henryb: East would have done better to switch to a @s after cashing her club, but ...|pg||
nt|pkl: For me 4NT natural, 4S cue. No way to end in a major after the preempt.|pg||
nt|henryb: I would play 3@c = @c and 2N = what minor|pg||
nt|sybarra: wasnt sure you would play that over interference,  but makes more sense than bidding 2 nt |pg||
nt|sharkirl: me too Henry|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was my first instinct also Henry |pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  N-IRELAND 76, SCOTLAND 70, ENGLAND 61, IRELAND 60, CBAI 59, WALES 30 ****|pg||
nt|sybarra: so they much have a meaning for 2 nt |pg||
nt|henryb: both majors lie well for declarer, so probably will make even with a trump lead|pg||

nt|lestergold: in any case this does not look like a hand likely to ive rise to any embarrasin post mortems|pg||
nt|ady: looks like win and try a heart switch    east should p lay the clubs to guard against 4-0 when the heart finesse wins|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petepunt:  when playing 5 card majors and strong nt after x|pg||
nt|athene: the way the bidding went, west might have taken a view and bid game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S seems quite s stretch to these timid eyes :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3NT has little chance on a spade lead|pg||

nt|athene: a thin 4@H might be reached NS|pg||
nt|athene: you might survive a misguess in trumps if you can get diamonds going for a spade pitch|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a hand full of potential|pg||

nt|roswolf: that hand will leave a few scars on north|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: another coffee break hand we need a couple of these after the recent excitmenet|pg||
nt|henryb: a trivial 4@h for N-S|pg||
nt|dburn: a couple more small swings to England when 3NT went one down rather than three, and 3@h made where 2@h failed in this room|pg||
nt|henryb: another partscore hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1@D 1@H 1@S 1N by NS uncontested, perhaps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a 3C opener by E could start some racket|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is a similar hand - Mighjt go 1@H -2 @D ; 2@H all pass|pg||
nt|athene: well 1@D will certainly get them there!|pg||
nt|mamos: Making 2@D was worth 7 imps to England as 1NT went 2 off|pg||
nt|dburn: but they add up to a useful lead for England, who could do with a win if they are to challenge for the Lady Milne trophy|pg||
nt|ahh: transfer anti cue bids   whatever next  bidding 2@C after 1nt to ask for majors  i ask you |pg||

nt|athene: really 4@H? or are we just skipping to the final contract?|pg||

nt|tejjyid: NOrth thinks 4@H is fit showing|pg||
nt|athene: responding 4@H at your first turn with that south hand expresses doubt as to partner's constructive bidding, i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: south's off shape double may complicate matters for everyone|pg||
nt|henryb: in my book 2@c is natural, nf and not particularly encouraging|pg||
nt|sn00py27: assuming it would be natural |pg||
nt|roswolf: another poor decision except tracy seems to have jumped into the fire|pg||

nt|athene: even if 4@H were fit-showing, surely you pass with @HKxx?|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Red save in 4S one off against 4H here due to the side fit in diamonds. In practise no-one could come in, let alone diagnose the double fit.|pg||
nt|henryb: N-S are actually cold for 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: more likely north was scared it was a splinter?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she thought splinter|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 2@C non forcing is popular - but not with Acol players:)|pg||
nt|col3435: yes this 2@c is an Acoly bid|pg||
nt|col3435: E/W aren't playing Acol but I expect that is the influence here|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: about to bid 3NT - shakes head and changes mind|pg||
nt|eggy: 5@Dx looks to be the par spot|pg||
nt|roswolf: north has been affected i think by the result on the previous hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: well n/s may beat par|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: and beating it |pg||
pc|sK|nt|henryb: a very useful dummy. it is easy to construct one on which 4@h has no play|pg||

nt|ahh: undo |pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: what is E worth if W can't double 1D but did anyway? most systems don;t cover that :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3@H will endplay partner - why not 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: lead holds it to 4 |pg||
nt|idc: defending 3nt would be too easy for NS :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|henryb: but my book recommends transfers after the opponent's to doubles as an alternative|pg||
nt|ahh: @S lead 4 rounds @C next |pg||
nt|idc: those @d in dummy should give a clue to correct defence|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: so would atrump lead|pg||
nt|ahh: that @C in dummy should |pg||
nt|ahh: she is teasing us  will find this   just very slowly|pg||
nt|idc: I suspect I might get to 4@h on these cards, and that isn't a success either|pg||
nt|idc: I think I'd push to bid 2@h over the 1@s overcall as a passed hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tejjyid: Even with 13 penalty cards, this would be a tough hand to make|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Good method|pg||
nt|sn00py27: that is what I play, but you miss out on playing 1NT sometimes :(|pg||

nt|chessmaste: well, the same one down as 3NT (assuming a diamond lead)|pg||
nt|col3435: I can't see how you can overcome the spade split here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|henryb: not badly as in DOIGB (Down One Is Good Bridge) :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: strange |pg||
pc|cK|nt|idc: and South would supoort hearts at some stage - maybe 5@d is still possible but tough|pg||
nt|pkl: So noone finds 5@D? The easiest contract to play, certainly ;-)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: statistically, the odds favor this not being the first time the potential ambiguity of this auction has come up. in that case S might have reflected that a response of 1H--however ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pedestrian--would go a long way towards getting partner to pass over an eventual 4H|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||

nt|tejjyid: Mercy ruling|pg||
nt|athene: E-W might be in trouble here|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D is natural?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe 2 suited?|pg||

nt|athene: south now waits hopefully for the takeout-double|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I doubt SOuth has much hope left|pg||
nt|roswolf: england need to pull their socks up and score some imps otherwise they will lose this match badly|pg||

nt|pkl: But why D? |pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: the bad news of the4/1 trump break balancede by the favourable position of the spade K|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south might now bid 4@S, putting her partner with 55 majors|pg||
nt|athene: and being worried about clubs in 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s should play in 5@D quite easily|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: 3@C is aggressive here|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S is reasonable enough...she has shown her hand by doubling i guess|pg||
nt|athene: but of course there are all sort of subtle misunderstandings possible here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I feel 3@S usually has 5|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: assuming it's "standard"; i.e. game-forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this N hand looks a lot more like an overcall than did the S hand on   5|pg||
nt|henryb: On the lead of the @d3 a case can be made for playing low from dummy: North has only one higher card and S might have led high from many holdings including AK|pg||

nt|idc: to make, declarer needs to duck this and set up @hK for a @d pitch|pg||
nt|idc: @hQ I meant|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: the double seems dubious|pg||
nt|athene: east had better not rise with that @DK|pg||
nt|sn00py27: the game that geoffrey and david wanted to bid on board 8 has got home - a winning spade got discarded|pg||
nt|sn00py27: 6 imps to england|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Very strange as up to that point West had discarded perfectly |pg||
nt|lestergold: good plahy of 7 clubs|pg||
nt|ahh: this is the downside of the comfort methods of telling p exactly what you hold |pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: dummy's stiff D will be a very welcome surprise|pg||
nt|athene: this will probably go down|pg||
nt|athene: there are only two obvious losers (@DA, trump)|pg||
nt|athene: but south can overruff spades|pg||
nt|athene: if you draw three rounds of trumps you have a couple of spade losers|pg||
nt|athene: since north has that precious @S8|pg||
nt|athene: dummy is a bit short of entries to get the hearts going|pg||
nt|athene: she knows her partner has nothing, more or less|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H might actually have been the only making game?|pg||
nt|athene: a good example of how you want the weaker hand's long suit to be trumps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and why bother? if a major is going to be 3-3, much better for it to be spades|pg||
nt|athene: because it's useless otherwise|pg||
nt|athene: yes, sure|pg||

pc|d8|nt|lestergold: now 11 tricks available|pg||

pc|d5|nt|mugsmate: Close decision to pass 2D - 2H certainly a possible choice by south. That Jxx in the suit on the right is a big turnoff though when spades aren't raised.|pg||
nt|ahh: you also tell an astute declaress|pg||
pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: i dont think 4H makes on best defense, does it?|pg||
nt|athene: i was just wondering...i thought it might come home, but maybe not|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|idc: declaress - I like that|pg||
pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: the diamond lead was not well conceived. W should lead a trump|pg||

nt|marlowepi: all W needed was the J|pg||
pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: heart ace anbd a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will play @SAK, ruff, and lose the three obvious tricks, i imagine|pg||
nt|idc: In case East has Kxx @h, it may have been right to duck a heart after just one round of trumps|pg||

nt|chessmaste: A bidding test for E/W |pg||
nt|roswolf: slamtime|pg||
nt|henryb: am fine|pg||
nt|sn00py27: 6@d best but hard to reach|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Perhaps 6NT is better than 6@D  |pg||
nt|eggy: England will pick up 7 on 23 where 5Dx luckily only goes -1|pg||
nt|ady: cant think why east did not cash out|pg||
nt|ahh: well done ROI  big board for them |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: why? after 2N-3@d-3@h-4@d seems easy|pg||
nt|ahh: this match reminds me of 2 heavyweight boxers knocking 7 bells out of each other |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hard to say where this will end up|pg||
nt|athene: 24 HCP for E-W but no real fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we make our own fate, horatio|pg||
nt|sn00py27: i will open 1H|pg||
nt|sn00py27: get the lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: tough hand in N,  strong 4441 hands not easy to bid |pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: 4NT from South, sugesting the secondary @D suit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: if S makes a peep in @S,  she will be in 4 |pg||
nt|sybarra: or at least 3 |pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: You might get to 7@D - it should make|pg||
nt|roswolf: now we will see|pg||
nt|henryb: I would open N 1@h. I WANT A @H lead!|pg||
nt|ahh: i thought my raises were thin |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: switch the five and ten of spades and 4S would go down|pg||
nt|tejjyid: X sugesting the @H fragment?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after the hes by S, N has to double|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right|pg||
nt|henryb: great minds|pg||
nt|sn00py27: as long as you play drury, partner won't get too carried away|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe they are playing 5 card majors|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  can be defeated   but Jagger might venture to 5@C|pg||
nt|ady: or 4@S |pg||
nt|ady: looks like e/w  not in bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: not easy for them after South opened that fine specimen|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Perhaps Jagger has no way of signing off in clubs now.|pg||
nt|mugsmate: If she did have I suspect she'd have done it by now.|pg||
nt|ahh: now 4@H ?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: south can't be very happy about 4@S getting passed out|pg||
nt|rnc: and might even pick some badly needed on 24|pg||
nt|henryb: no: a renege = failure to follow suit. a renege can be corrected if found before the side has played to the next trick|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: now she knows it was right to bid on|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: East did well not to get over-excited - she does have quite a lot of HCP for a simple overcall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: really? she opened a rag. maybe all she lost is diff between 50 & 100 while anything by NS going for 300|pg||
nt|lestergold: but if i was openng i would still open a heart|pg||
nt|sn00py27: i like to show where I can take tricks and clubs are not going to be very fruitful :)|pg||
nt|ahh: superb |pg||
nt|pkl: 4@H is a very nice contract, and not an obvious one to reach|pg||
nt|ahh: see i can be nice  2 hands in a row as well |pg||
nt|idc: but for how long will that drain your milk of human kindness Jim?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S makes as the cards lie but that's very lucky|pg||
nt|eggy: true - could be 14 if NS bid 6D|pg||
nt|ady: some would dbl 1NT with west's hand  though not safe from a weak hand with east|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: i love the understatement|pg||
nt|henryb: a revoke is after the reneger's side has played to the next trick|pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: why not a cuebid from west?|pg||
nt|henryb: surely W should bid 6@d with all those controls, not 5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|eggy: but should lose on the ill-judged 5@H hand|pg||
nt|sn00py27: they are playing 5CM, that's why I said Mike :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: and indeed the opening bid have cost the defence a trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: as predicted|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: well it would be hard for E-W to double 5@C or 5@H i think|pg||
nt|athene: as the cards lie|pg||
nt|col3435: maybe unsure about which suit a cue-bid would be agreeing|pg||
nt|sn00py27: maybe she is thinking minimum, but with so many controls this is better|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 5@D very strange|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: yp east did well to bid 6 in the end|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: if the defence led trumps to stop a diamond ruff, declarer could just ruff the clubs good with the @DA as entry|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C was an alternative for West, over the double|pg||
nt|rnc: Even in game it will be 11 imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: this does not look favorite|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|eggy: good lead|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: i thought we were talking about S's reaction to the passout, before she knows the layout|pg||
nt|chessmaste: She was facing 20-22|pg||
nt|pkl: Would any of you have bid 3@D with the S hand? I would|pg||
nt|ahh: am i allowed to say east bid like a Guy ?|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|rnc: Needs quite a lot of mistakes by defense for letting this thru|pg||
nt|ady: not so easy for west to p  lay the queen   though cost nothing play having the 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could be down a bunch |pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: yes true but south still can't be that happy surely|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eggy: looks like only 9 on board 24 as CBAI are in 3@Sx|pg||
nt|roswolf: they wont be that generous|pg||
nt|rnc: and not likely|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|eggy: not being very helpful at all in fact|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ady: seemed to have lost the club ruffs|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|h6|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|col3435: I suspect East was going to slam whatever happened. Finding diamond support is just a nice bonus.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s8|nt|henryb: perhaps the failure to cue either balck suit should promise neither or both controls|pg||
nt|lestergold: the club opener lets face it was pointless playing 5cm pass was the sound bid heart was the second best bid a slight lie club bid .....ugh     |pg||

nt|tejjyid: @S K|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but by the same token, if S had stiff king, what was the long hesitation about?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I have noticed that a few pairs - Meckwell included - tend to belive the opponents and assume partner has the other major |pg||
nt|mugsmate: Difficult for the defense to credit this shape to north. Clever play winning the cQ as well. It hid the club position even better.|pg||

nt|lestergold: im happy with heart but pass i was saying was the sound bid with a bad 11 count and no suitable bid within ur system but i like to get the lead direction in this uis true|pg||
nt|sybarra: previous hand, push on the 3 nt  |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: "thin" in HCP only--it is a very sound contract, almost laydown|pg||
nt|ady: light sshapely opeming from west|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes true it's a good spot|pg||
nt|ahh: 2@S ?|pg||
nt|ahh: maybe not 2nd  in hand with 4@H|pg||
nt|pkl: Not at this vul, Jim. You werent serious?|pg||
nt|idc: I have a sneaking admiration for 2@s, but even for me it is too much|pg||
nt|ahh: surely south isnt thinking of bidding |pg||
nt|pkl: or am i being pussilanimous?? ;-)|pg||
nt|idc: because of 2nd seat & the vul, not the suit itself|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sn00py27: another opportunity for a lead directing bid |pg||
nt|sn00py27: are e/w 5CM ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: not vulnerable spade pener mandatory|pg||
nt|lestergold: opnere|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Kelly has a very similar hand to an earlier one. The hearts don't break any better this time either.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: 2@D perhaps from north?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: too hard for me|pg||
nt|eggy: which they will probably lose back on 25|pg||
nt|sn00py27: try again :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: opener its my keyboard sticking|pg||
nt|ady: may kee[ n/s out this time|pg||
nt|idc: good hand for 2@d Ekrens mind you :)|pg||
nt|ahh: i cant begin to describe my thoughts on 2@C   this is a family show |pg||
nt|pkl: At that vulnerability I prefer a somewhat  better suit - and not 4@H|pg||
nt|ahh: i have 14 points  i must bid |pg||
nt|pkl: I would have passed the S hand, but 2@C might work well even if you don't like it.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: south is a bit short of entries to her hand to use the clubs in 3nt|pg||
nt|pkl: No - Punch passed, so it will be 2@C S|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: as a clever sort of lead-directing 2@S bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if it means that|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ahh: let the doubling commence |pg||
nt|idc: don't like 2@c either but it might lead to an interesting auction|pg||
nt|pkl: Argh... why D as East???|pg||
nt|idc: East should be thinking: where are the spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: discretion the better part by Nelson|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and will achieve a plus score|pg||
nt|lestergold: and e/w but it in a making 3s all sound stuff|pg||
nt|lestergold: buy it|pg||
nt|idc: and probably pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: declarer has six trumps, @SK, and @DA |pg||
nt|henryb: X presumably is "Don't" or something similar|pg||
nt|ady: a quick pass from west  before anything dire happens|pg||
nt|henryb: I would probably have tried 2N with N hand|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sn00py27: the only time I have ever gone for 1700 - I opened multi with 5@S to KQ10. Opps came in with 2S which only promised 4, raised to game which was a 4-2 fit and partner backed in with ...|pg||
nt|sn00py27: 5@H ..........|pg||
nt|idc: goodness, is this really happening?|pg||
nt|pkl: What??|pg||
nt|ahh: i can only describe this auction as undescribable |pg||
pc|c3|nt|idc: West can have QJTxxx clubs and nothing else, 3@h seems a little forward|pg||
nt|idc: or even JTxxx clubs and nothing else|pg||
nt|ahh: i have other words for 3@H    they have something to do with canine |pg||
nt|idc: stikll, you have to admit this is fun|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: can she set up a long heart to make this?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S is worth another call, i think--N could have:  xxx  Qxxxxx  KQx   x. i would double 3C to show extras|pg||
nt|athene: south has to attack dummy's entries|pg||
nt|athene: to prevent declarer ruffing the hearts good and getting back to them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and above all (still on the last hand), if S had stiff spade king, wouldnt she have at least thought a long time about playing three rounds of clubs, since pd could uppercut ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dummy's ace if N had spade ten or jack?|pg||
nt|eggy: Did well I think, to heed the gypsy's warning - I can't imagine Tracy passing 2S|pg||
nt|henryb: makes 4 without an immediate @d shift|pg||
nt|sn00py27: dummy must have been a welcome sight|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|henryb: makes 4 without an immediate @d shift|pg||
pc|d3|nt|idc: if the specs had to watch our auctions, they would be bored|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|ahh: a little nowledge is a dangerous thing |pg||

pc|hK|pg||
nt|ahh: :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: even if declarer led a club from hand to the @CQ you should probably duck with east|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: but surely @SA and @SQ was safe?|pg||
nt|athene: and when she leads the @CQ, advertising great strength in the suit, it's more clear|pg||

mb|p|nt|col3435: well I quite like 4NT. You'll certainly find out what you need to know. The only problem is that sometimes what you find out is that you should be in 4@h|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: it all went according to the script until south didn't double :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes i had actually worked out that W would raise hearts. the question was how and how many|pg||
nt|athene: if you transfer a king, then east has a pretty easy pass |pg||
mb|p|nt|rnc: Yeh|pg||
nt|sybarra: well?  |pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: now if that is 3 or zero south's next bid id clearcut|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i really don't know why south didn't double 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|sn00py27: I wouldn't expect 4NT to be keycard there as you have so many ways to agree @H first|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: invitational to 8 or 9 ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: play will be quick|pg||
nt|lestergold: well e/w have about a 5percent  3n available which is on absoluite ice due to every card beiing right|pg||

nt|lestergold: even i do not approve of this |pg||

nt|marlowepi: If I ended up in 6S making on this layout, I would ask the opps if we could just score it as 1370 instead of 1430, so we could tell our teammates we played in 6C. it would be worth ...|pg||

nt|marlowepi: Bill, you need to add to your list of the virtues of 6S "no D lead or D king with opening leader"|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 3@H was an overbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and lastly to BBO and of course Roland Wald who organises all these Vu-Graph presentations|pg||
nt|lestergold: well n/s have done well to stay out of game on this hnad but northn had  agame try and south an accept just  unlucky with the duplication of values on the hand|pg||
nt|ahh: thanks to Ian and Peter for their comments |pg||
nt|sybarra: and to our specs,  we appreciate your comments  @H@H|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rnc: And also to the audience for their tips...|pg||
nt|rnc: ...and to you Geoffrey|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: well this looks good for 8 tricks at the very least|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: might still make 12 on Q@D lead|pg||
nt|mugsmate: 4S seems to be an underbid with all those controls and Kx in partner's side suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mugsmate: Seale - Jagger certainly bid extremely well this set - one or two slight misdefences, but a strong performance from the England pair overall.|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Thanks all, goodnight.|pg||
nt|henryb: 3N by N will make after the @c lead by going after two @h tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: no doubt S would have doubled 3D if she didnt like the other unbid suit even better|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thanks to Lady Milne for inspiring the eponymous trophy that crowns this event|pg||

nt|pkl: Bye Jim|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: well that lead solves a certain problem for declarer|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the "9th trick" problem...|pg||
nt|athene: namely, where trick number nine is coming from|pg||
nt|ady: england not so good OR    missed the 6@D slam   and were not in game on board 29 the board Jagger opened the multi|pg||
nt|ady: nite Jon|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu Henry,  and thx |pg||
pc|cT|nt|sharkirl: tks all|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: the next match is coming up shortly - in about 30 minutes, i think|pg||
nt|sn00py27: as well as some overbidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: just as overbidding was rewarded to ROI when they bid a bad 3n which couldnt be beaten|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
nt|ady: diamond back could be best    if that is ruffed  then very likely trumps will be breaking and diamonds can be set up|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx michael |pg||

pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|ady: will need to negotiate an extra club trick on this play|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: S retuirned her 4th best spade at Trick 2 as the books say one should. but probably not on this hand--to beat 3NT partner will need an entry--and even then where will we get 5 ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tricks? S should play back Q of spades hoping for a duck (correct if spades are 5-3), then if N turns up with only four spades (by following up the line), she can shift to diamonds|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|sn00py27: all she had to do on the last was cross to dummy' ace - finesse the diamond again and claim 9|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
mc|9|nt|eggy: should hold this now as South has show 15 points|pg||
