mb|p|nt|mamos: can there be too many Catherines? |pg||
nt|henryb: never|pg||
nt|sharkirl: slam to start|pg||
nt|jallerton: NS play 5-card majors, weak NT and quite a few gadgets|pg||
nt|bobholl: in 1950 this deal migth be passed out now i doubt that :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|eggy: NS system card on http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/systems/mcmahon-kirby.pdf|pg||
nt|mug: so how might it go|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: Play ball!|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: My Co-commentators are David Collier, Catherine Draper and Mark Horton and I am Geoffrey Wolfarth |pg||
nt|dburn: not much of an opening bid, those North cards, but these days almost anything goes|pg||
nt|ady: hi all|pg||
mb|2D|nt|henryb: X = minor-major?|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi all |pg||
nt|jallerton: would you bid on the East hand?|pg||
nt|bobholl: losing 4@H and 2 aces 1nt will just make |pg||
nt|asnuttyas: Good afternoon all|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hi good evening everyone |pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|athene: club lead will get the defence off to a good start|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi stephen - do we know the systems in use?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: not off hand...|pg||
nt|pkl: Okay... the first board. I just realise we are quite a small bunch. 2@S|pg||
nt|steshome: Hello all|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: just a little joke from the operator? :)|pg||
nt|mug: 1@S from North, 2@C South, 2@H North, 3@D South, 3@S North, 3NT South perhaps?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@S-2@c-2@H-3NT perhaps|pg||
mb|3C|nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stayman was not out of the question|pg||
nt|athene: not only is it safe, but east gets to make two discards which might be helpful|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you were right in a way about the auction Bill. it was passed out. after the opening bid, that is :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes, stayman was a possibility with the north hand (intending to pass any rebid from opener)|pg||
nt|dburn: 1NT alerted - may be forcing, I guess, but about 2@c I am not sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: south is bidding a lot|pg||
nt|eggy: Just when West thought it was starting to look good|pg||
nt|henryb: then 2@h = pass or correct|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe South thinks it's a transfer and North doesn't|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case the final contract could be somewhat less than elegant|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Your commentators are Marshall Lewis and William Frisby|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@S looks makeable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the spades lie as lovely as could be|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk7: Player names please operator|pg||
nt|athene: south has a very nice hand, even if she doesn't have a name yet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: usually they make it through a few hands before they play anonymously|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a LOT off|pg||
nt|eggy: quite a poor bid by east on reflection|pg||
nt|sybarra: can the slam be bid?  |pg||
nt|sharkirl: Hi shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: guess not |pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Michael |pg||
nt|mug: interesting play probllem|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i can think of people who would open 2@C on that south hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi Catherine, Steve, Calle and Geoffrey. Havee fun :)|pg||
nt|dburn: not that there's much wrong with 2@d as a contract, but not by North-South|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  a bit of a push|pg||
nt|bobholl: does he think N had 5@H :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: she|pg||
mb|3N|nt|idc: Morning Peter, morning everyone|pg||
nt|pkl: So we ended in 3@C - sensible bidding everywhere|pg||
nt|pkl: Good morning Ian|pg||
nt|idc: This is a more open Lady Milne than for years, so I'm looking forward to an exciting day of bridge|pg||
nt|pkl: I might as S be tempted to bid 3@H - that singleton club looks really nice|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnc: Hi|pg||
nt|eggy: west almost guaranteed to hold 5 spade|pg||
nt|henryb: indeed: favorable breaks in all suits and @hA well placed|pg||
nt|mamos: whereas 1Nt would make so Catherine North has done well|pg||
nt|dburn: however, they seem to be on track|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.cbai.ie/documents/LadyMilneScoreboard1.pdf  for results and standing after round 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hi roland will do|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a feisty auction and i am not sure whether this will be an objectively good result for the declaring side|pg||
nt|col3435: yes, how does 4@h do?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|dburn: this ought not to make, but with the favourable red suit position East-West could make about 2NT, so no great harm done|pg||
nt|sharkirl: quick clain when Sq appears|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: 2S plays well. but 1NT can make also|pg||
nt|col3435: seems to me like it might come in|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: yes, there is the double heart finesse for declarer if she chooses to take it|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dburn: still, not so obvious for West to play a red suit ace now, which is what she needs to do|pg||
nt|dburn: although I guess @d3 might also work|pg||
nt|dburn: and might be more accurate defence|pg||
nt|dburn: the point being that by playing diamonds twice more, West can in effect create a trump trick for herself|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: E's puny spade suit probably touted her off the slam |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|roswolf: yes it may well but will e/w get there in the other room? n/s bidding i think helped|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|dburn: but now she really does need to play a diamond, and not...|pg||
pc|dT|nt|dburn: ...a spade|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rnc: South was quite happy I suppose when seeing dummy with 5 spades|pg||
nt|dburn: now, provided Cath Jagger takes the right view of the clubs, she can succeed|pg||
pc|d5|nt|col3435: I'd say West always had enough to bid 4@h after East had raised|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Let's suppose North cashed a top club and then switched to the jack of diamonds - quite testing for declarer then |pg||
nt|sybarra: checking the @D break  |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: it is all about the first round of hearts and cashing only one diamond before playing hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but she will surely throw a heart here|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|rnc: yes|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: -800 seems predestined|pg||
nt|eggy: lucky it wasn't 1100 on that line|pg||
pc|s4|nt|steshome: We need England to win 25:0 and ROI and CBAI to beat Northern Ireland and CBAI (haven't worked out the margins)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: now south gets squeezed in spades and diamonds|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|dburn: a dollar short and a day late for that diamond, but declarer still not home|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: maybe Jagger cannot play west for club queen on such a defence|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|henryb: I think she should have ducked the first club|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: well, she would have done if declarer finessed hearts retaining a top diamond in hand|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: sorry *East* gets squeezed|pg||
pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: since S needs heart king on regardless, the choice is between 3-3 diamonds and heart ten being onside. the latter is more likely|pg||
nt|sn00py27: E might have dbled with an Ace so should get right|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: has done|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe she can - good effort|pg||

nt|jallerton: 25:5 is the same a 25:0 as far as England team is concerned; depriving Wales of further VPs is cruel|pg||

mb|1D|nt|idc: Redbl here is I think a single suited rescue|pg||
nt|pkl: North has a difficult decision here - double or show hearts. No macro could solve that one, Roland|pg||
nt|idc: West will bid 2@c and East then reveals her suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: most likely a @c raise |pg||
nt|sybarra: also exploring for nt,  but 3nt be 1 too high|pg||
nt|mug: South must pass, any action zero|pg||
nt|mug: if partner can't bid over 1@S NS have nothing on, and EW may have a better contract|pg||
nt|mug: 1@D I meant|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Standing before the last round: 1. Northern Ireland 76 - 2. Scotland 74 - 3. England 61|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwww|pg||
nt|athene: although if north leads her partner's suit that will help|pg||
nt|athene: ouch|pg||
nt|mug: ok well judged by Mrs Nelson|pg||
nt|Walddk5: So realistically, only NI and Scotland can win the trophy from here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Scotland take on CBAI|pg||
nt|jallerton: West has an awkward hand to describe over 1NT|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: very hard to disagnose though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E took a real chance here...|pg||
nt|ady: tranfer to hearts     likely down 2 at 2 level|pg||
nt|dburn: may be one major, rather than a transfer|pg||
nt|mdgraham: web site at http://www.cbai.ie/|pg||
nt|mug: so if England score 25, not unlikely against bottom-placed Wales, they get up to 86 VPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north was doing the thinking :) i doubt east had to think too hard about that one|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure the auction should be taking this long|pg||
nt|dburn: not particularly sound whatever it is, mind|pg||
nt|dburn: still, no one can ever double anyone for penalties nowadays|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rnc: This one will for sure be cheaper|pg||
nt|henryb: you are obviously not an accountant.|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i do have an oxford maths degree if it was cambrisge then id be able to add up|pg||
nt|henryb: Pender thinks she has died and gone to heaven|pg||
nt|lestergold: in oxford they only taught me how to punt|pg||
nt|mamos: horses or skiffs?|pg||
nt|henryb: there is a story of the CEO who wanted to find out what 2+2=|pg||
nt|henryb: He called in his economists. they said 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: without birth control 2+2 can equal quite a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i might have bid something over 1@C as east|pg||
nt|sybarra: although, might have the timing on a @H lead |pg||
nt|mug: would need specific results from the other two matches|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: decided against finding a 4-4 @H fit|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D distribution bit tricky :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: @sJ lead will knock out the entry|pg||
nt|jallerton: small @d to the J could be ducked by S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sn00py27: I thought we might get an idea on this hand whether they play weak or strong NT :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In these times many East's would open - especially with an eye on the vulnerability|pg||
nt|sn00py27: E/W|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this should be easy enough|pg||
nt|idc: I think I like 2NT by South now - she has a little too much to give up on game|pg||
nt|pkl: 3NT really sounds like "STOP". Can West find the diamond lead?|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: could be and should be|pg||
nt|steshome: Good lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: probably better to play in 7D. at least you go off only one when diamonds break your heart|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D must be showing something like north's hand - and south ought to be getting mildly excited|pg||
nt|col3435: some convention cards at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/lmteams.htm|pg||
nt|col3435: N/S play "Acol with 5-card majors and a strong NT"|pg||
nt|col3435: E/W card isn't there but I think they play strong+5 too|pg||
nt|sn00py27: Not quite Acol then !|pg||
nt|ady: this wont make    but n/s likely to make 8 tricks in 1NT|pg||
nt|idc: ok, or that gets the job done even more easily :)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: the aces will take care of partner's @H+@C losers, however those two cards are split|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|col3435: well, yes. Seems like a contradiction in terms to me. But that's what they say.|pg||
nt|steshome: Good play|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: @SJ10 might be useful fillers...@DAK9 is great|pg||
nt|henryb: he did not like that, so he called in his information tech people. wait a moment they said, we will check on the computer|pg||
nt|pkl: Oh - no reason to worry. I bet we'll have eleven tricks in the sack in no time.|pg||
nt|idc: A pity that we didn't get a chance to see if West would find @d lead v3NT, Q best perhaps|pg||
nt|pkl: That is a nice lead ... looks as if i holds N to ten tricks|pg||
pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: understandable that NS are hoping to create some action given the match score. but that 5C bid is infinitely more likely to widen the gap than to close it|pg||
nt|athene: East will be disappointed to get only her top trumps from here|pg||
nt|steshome: I understand that the standing before the last round is Northern Ireland on 76, Scotland on 74 and England on 61|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: immediate @D hook |pg||
nt|steshome: Good duck|pg||
nt|bobholl: goo duck i'm sure|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: admittedly you don't want to bid a grand slam when there is a chance they might not reach the small slam in the other room|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, so down two may show a profit, but there are easier ways to make a living|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am puzzled why N did not respond 2D|pg||
nt|athene: a 6-card minor is shorter than a 5-card major, for most people, these days|pg||
nt|col3435: (it probably just means "not 2/1 GF")|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: i am sorry to say|pg||
nt|eggy: good defence|pg||
nt|henryb: back they came. 4 they said|pg||
nt|lestergold: good start for Catherine|pg||
nt|henryb: he did not like that, so he called in the accountants|pg||
nt|lestergold: east may well be endoplayed more times thanm she likes for her visit to heavan|pg||
nt|henryb: What would you like it to be, they asked? :)|pg||

pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: EW would probably get another trick if W continued spades, but that is not too likely|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but there is more to it than that. 2D has the advantage of announcing strength immediately also|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||

nt|athene: well, i don't know N-S's methods, but i am assuming Acol-ish, so things tend not to be forcing :)|pg||

nt|ady: nice multi|pg||
nt|idc: We should start to see some comparisons coming from the other table soon - specs can open a Movie|pg||
mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: that is the humnan reality, true, though in international matches one is more or less expected to overcome those foibles|pg||
nt|mamos: i think the hand was played rotated so op had problems  as it seems did the players and commentators|pg||
nt|mugsmate: That sort of multi makes me feel old. Routine when I was at university 15 years ago.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You are lucky, it makes *me* feel sick|pg||
nt|mugsmate: First in at favourable vulnerability is a good time to be a bit random, so long as your partner knows not to punish you.|pg||
nt|ady: if they get the club suit right then 3T will make|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: alerted as weak major, max 7pts|pg||
nt|mugsmate: The multi may be just what is required to protect that club queen.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that Multi may cause declarer not to get clubs right|pg||
nt|ady: Jagger may sacrifice in 4@H|pg||
nt|idc: - bottom right of screen button - and see how the boards play out there|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is not a slam,  e/w in game in major,  sac in @D for n/s?|pg||
nt|mug: although I did take delivery of a box of dubious quality wine yesterday |pg||
nt|bobholl: 4 @H + 1 :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|marlowepi: N should not have that worry when S cues 5C|pg||
nt|roswolf: will south fancy this hand?|pg||
nt|sharkirl: 4s |pg||
nt|mug: perhaps your stake would be a Blue Nun Sarah?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would be tempted to bid 2@C over 1@H with East |pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT overcall?|pg||
nt|henryb: over an opening 1@s do you overcall 1N or double and bid 2N|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT for me|pg||
nt|sn00py27: opp passed hand I am happy to settle with 1NT|pg||
nt|henryb: I think I would double and bid 2N actually|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: anyone prefer 2nt instead of 3@D?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|mug: I do|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: a not very bold prediction, Bob :)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: east doubled 1@D intending to bid spades next and show a strong hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has announced a strong NT, and six is cold facing both round aces and diamond KQ, which is only 13|pg||
nt|chessmaste: South might protect |pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be finis|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1nt not unreasonable all acions are going to be distorted with this hand|pg||
nt|sn00py27: but I would do something with S - unless they play 2@C as conventional and she has no easy bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1n is the closest|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Just 3H. If you play this random style, you have to play it as a PARTNERSHIP. Jagger can't go to 4H when partner may be so weak.|pg||
nt|ady: 4H could be 500 or 800 |pg||
nt|dburn: trouble is, she still doesn't know which major her partner has|pg||
nt|mug: and I feel 2@H on the North hand was a bit passive|pg||
nt|steshome: Oh for you, a bottle of the finest liebfraumilch.  Actually, I'll take odds of 15-1.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: any prediction regarding the LM is bold|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: she doesn't really want her next decision to be selecting a lead to 1@DX|pg||
nt|athene: it's a pretty good suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: she appears to|pg||
nt|dburn: if it turns out to be spades, 4@s might even be making|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Interestingly, north has shown 4-4 in the majors and south has shown 5 hearts, so there is no real reason to get the clubs wrong anymore.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but look what it has led to|pg||
nt|mug: so I lose either way Sarah?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@D was about to go two down|pg||
nt|steshome: :) I don't like this effort at catching up|pg||
nt|mug: usual story|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: south should bid 2c surely|pg||
mb|r|nt|marlowepi: i wouldn;t need to be tempted. i would do it before temptation even arose|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i would not like to play the n/s hands at the 3 level but maybe that is why i am commentating these days|pg||
nt|henryb: yes, or double 1N would be my choice|pg||
nt|idc: All roads seem to lead to 3NT making here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Pass can be the hardest bidding card to put on the table|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I don't believe this|pg||
nt|steshome: What on earth is going on?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|athene: hmmm this auction seems illogical|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Enterprising and unlucky to find partner with most of her points in spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the drinks have been spiked|pg||
nt|bobholl: better than no prediction :) ?|pg||
nt|steshome: The previous board was well defended, Tom|pg||
mb|5N|nt|athene: i assume West in fact didn't pass|pg||
nt|sn00py27: should make 3@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: she has the theoretical values for a double but hand is too top heavy for it for my liking|pg||
nt|mamos: Pass would be a field if partner had psyched|pg||
nt|henryb: partner is third hand at favorable ...|pg||
nt|idc: I guess 6@d is playable but a bit ambitious|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: No, it's mainly because you are not a woman|pg||
nt|roswolf: east has saved the opps bacon|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They won't allow you in even if you shave, Geoffrey|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it is probably getting tken out as indeed it was and then u have to show trhis limite dhand at the 3 level|pg||
mb|6D|nt|athene: either South or West probably bid 1@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you dont want a spade lead from Txxxx or some rubbish against 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: presumably south denied 4 spades by bidding 2nt|pg||
nt|sn00py27: as 8 counts go - it is quite decent|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes has the 2 extra 9's|pg||
nt|lestergold: even more reason to bid a quiet 2 clubs|pg||
nt|mamos: i like 2C because if partner is light you have tolerance for @S and no great harm is done|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate this hand was always likely to finish where it has|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: maybe N simply did the multiplication and made the bid that would complete the equation|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3@H I don't care for|pg||
nt|chessmaste: or 3@S|pg||
nt|sn00py27: me neither, was thinking of passing back to partner or 2NT|pg||
nt|mug: dreadful |pg||
mb|6H|nt|athene: well, good old partner found a club lead anyway :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 3@S was very hasty|pg||
nt|col3435: yes it ought to be possible for N/S to scramble to their best fit after the Dbl|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3@S has two chances - slim and none|pg||
nt|col3435: but evidently a confident 3@h has its merits|pg||
nt|lestergold: and its infrangible|pg||
mb|p|nt|mugsmate: Key moment|pg||
nt|ady: a lot of imps here|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Seems that only if south is exactly 3541 or 2551 does south have a singleton club. There are more shapes where south has 2 clubs.|pg||
nt|pkl: I don't find it obvious that you end in 3NT. 5@D looks also reasonable to me. |pg||
mb|6S|nt|henryb: I prefer impregnable|pg||
nt|pkl: ... or 4@S ;-)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: and 1NT or 2NT is a likely enough rebid for S|pg||
nt|ady: roof falls in|pg||
nt|pkl: Much more interesting than 3NT!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: definitely not one for the kids, this|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: 2 of @H for the club lead |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: a new one but be careful Henry some of these ladies are quite young |pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: it is not devoid of hope - defence may assist|pg||
nt|rnc: Due to the CC, a direct 2NT would have been xfer to @D - so this will presumably be their way to invite "1NT-2NT"|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: why didn't south rebid 1@S?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: a likely push |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|henryb: yes, well ...|pg||

nt|eggy: at least on the 800 hand - Stockdale bid the making game (5D)|pg||
nt|mug: neither defender had a genuine double, it sounds like EW had much more shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: an awful lot of slams in this set already. what's up with that? a spec asked if this is goulasch LOL|pg||
nt|athene: Multi-2@D; east might try 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb: a bad unbiddable 3N?|pg||
nt|henryb: that happens to make|pg||
nt|ady: a diamond slam for e/w|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Six diamonds by east is a great spot here - the play complicated by the unlucky 3-0 trump break.|pg||
nt|ady: if they get the diamond right|pg||
nt|pkl: I also thought about 3NT on last deal, Ian - but I was a little bit uncertain as to whether it was for NS or for EW ;-)|pg||
nt|sybarra: a wk nt |pg||

mb|1N|nt|roswolf: now this could be fun|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 16 +8 will they bid 3NT?|pg||
nt|pkl: A very nice 6@H... should be easy to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: an awful lot of slam bidding, and vice versa :)|pg||
nt|steshome: The hand with @sJxxxx might have doubled 5@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: looks like the Multi. either that or everybody has a fatal attraction for the 2D card in the bidding box (as did S on the previous hand)|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D is certainly spades but hard to be sure what strength it shows|pg||
nt|athene: there are several schemes for rebids here, and west might be cautiously treating it as minimum or optimistically treating it as maximium|pg||
nt|rnc: And if bid and made twice, it'll be... 800 :)|pg||
nt|dburn: unlucky start to the auction - will now play the wrong way round for the Burn Percentage Play to work|pg||
nt|ady: if south does not lead a club   can make even mis guessing the diamond|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will be a scramble |pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes - but generally auctions like that end in someone doubling, whether the contract can be defeated or not |pg||
nt|bobholl: will they stay of 3NT ? doubt it|pg||
nt|jallerton: I was about to predict 2@d by W here - N changed that by opening|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: 5C may not be a great idea when one opp has passed and your partner has not|pg||
nt|petepunt:  evening all|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening|pg||

nt|roswolf: ty|pg||
nt|eggy: If she'd tried 6, she'd have made that too I suppose|pg||
nt|dburn: however, after this start they may reach only 3NT anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: but East has done well|pg||
nt|mug: 3NT is cold isn't it?|pg||
nt|steshome: Agressive opener - Fee knows a big win is needed|pg||
pc|c6|nt|idc: We don't have a CC for NS so we can try to guess their system as the match developes|pg||
nt|mug: one of the English juniors has just told me how much he appreciates the opportunity BBO gives him and his friends to watch some of the country's top internationals in play|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: i think north could afford to take it a bit slower|pg||
nt|athene: one opponent has passed|pg||
nt|athene: and you have a fair amount in the majors|pg||
nt|eggy: unless West leads a spade|pg||
nt|sn00py27: 1nt - 3NT ?|pg||
nt|henryb: at most 2N|pg||
nt|dburn: West has plenty of extra playing strength, but no really convenient way to show it|pg||
nt|mugsmate: I agree east hass done well, but a byproduct of 3S is that south may well lead a club now.|pg||
nt|idc: My first guess is that they play splinters :)|pg||

nt|bobholl: i see only signs for pass|pg||
nt|mug: and Stockdale should have bid it |pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, you'll have to take the first @d if that suit is led - wonderful|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: and it's game-all - opps aren't at favourable or anything scary like that|pg||
nt|dburn: well, they are in six now|pg||
nt|mug: Capal and Nelson must play an extremely solid overcalling style if these bids are correct|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sn00py27: East's bidding on this hand has worked well|pg||
nt|chessmaste: They have done well - hardly obvious to insist on game facing a weak two in diamonds|pg||
nt|sn00py27: good start|pg||
nt|lestergold: north should go|pg||
nt|dburn: or very shortly|pg||
nt|mug: for me the North hand would be worth 2@D over 2@C, and South would pass 2@H|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: well they sort of do, after AK of clubs|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pkl: I believe you are right... and some kind of Blackwood?|pg||

nt|mug: @DK @CA throwing a spade, @HA, diamond ruff, heart |pg||
nt|mug: losing two hearts and two spades|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rnc: Yes|pg||
nt|idc: I like North's actions - not quite worth more than 4@h after the splinter in AKQx suit|pg||
nt|pkl: I would have been much weaker bidding 4@D - perhaps it is some "double strength" type of cue|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|henryb: look how bad this 3N is: needs both black suits to run and not to lose 4@d and the @sA|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: yes, they do now|pg||
nt|lestergold: its far from throw against wall but i think that its a vulnerable game that should be bid|pg||
nt|bobholl: why not overtaken ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: snap|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dburn: one indication may come if South leads @c10, though - short clubs implies long diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: excellent slam  will be unlucky to go down|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: could @DA and another ever be wrong?|pg||
nt|lestergold: its thinnish but tghe intermediates create additional chances as here with clubs breaking 4/2 but the ten of clubs to the rescue etc|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade intermediates good- dims can b e blocked or notm led when they are 5/3|pg||

nt|henryb: It is about 50% for each black suit. so both is 25%. you have some other chances but not many|pg||
nt|dburn: well, I would go down for sure, but East may draw the right inference|pg||

nt|tejjyid: @C K lead, followed by @HK |pg||
nt|tejjyid: then pitch all the @S |pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: Gordon having difficulty finding this in his book|pg||
nt|marlowepi: an unusual type of double dummy problem|pg||
nt|marlowepi: declarer cursing her luck "why doesnt this ever happen when we bid a dicey slam???"|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: We're skipping this awaiting a decision|pg||
nt|eggy: a bit wet that pass|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   inlikely to get into the auction    looks like 2@S  n/s|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@h would not be among my choices on that suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: that is tracy's style|pg||
nt|dburn: a couple of small swings to England in the first three boards - they might have been larger, but ...|pg||
nt|idc: East's 2@d here is no doubt equal length in majors - at least I hope it is :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: (glad p brought some @H's) |pg||
nt|steshome: Good view to save on the West hand |pg||
nt|jallerton: Nice save founf by Jean Hand|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chessmaste: North passed - we have some sound bidders on VuGraph today |pg||
nt|roswolf: will the rabbi'c rule be applied?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: this is the 13 penalty card hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: rabbi's|pg||
nt|chessmaste: he's not playing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but maybe NS play differently|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: south did indeed open 2@C on the 4@S-7@H hand and duly reached slam|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room|pg||
nt|tejjyid: played without penaly, apparently|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room, north led a heart|pg||
nt|athene: i would certainly prefer a spade from those two suits|pg||
nt|marlowepi: which at llong last i understand. this event is the Home Internationals, and most  accidents  happen at home|pg||
nt|athene: then declarer played @CA and viewed to duck on the next round|pg||

nt|ady: 2@D shows a weak hand with a 2nd suit of hearts   an immediate 2@H  would be stronger|pg||
nt|idc: and 4@h is guessing that 2@d shows some values, though I don't see why it should|pg||
nt|idc: well, I don't like the bidding much but it has got them to a perfectly playable spot|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pkl: Just fell off. My internet is not 100% stable|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petepunt:  looks lie 9 tricks with care|pg||
nt|athene: the @H9 comes down|pg||
nt|athene: so you don't need to ruff any hearts|pg||
nt|eggy: unlike the 3S opener, - even at this vul|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pkl: I wrote it looks like ten tricks just before I was dropped.|pg||
nt|idc: don't leave me alone for too long Peter - it wouldn't be fair on the specs for one thing!|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|rnc: South might have had some hopes for a trump trick|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|petepunt:  can cross ruff high anyway|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: could make ten tricks perhaps by a loser-on-loser? lead @DJ, throw club on it|pg||
nt|eggy: still - it shouldn't be too taxing to defend|pg||
nt|idc: as long as declarer keeps trumps control tight, it should be making|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: then throw another club on the @D10?|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you bid with the E hand, Henry?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|chessmaste: See|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: it might be hard to organise the drawing of trumps in the middle of all this i suppose|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pkl: There are 34 specs. Do they all know you, Ian? ;-)|pg||
nt|henryb: you have to bid, since you are short in @s, but I think 3@h is begging for trouble|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rnc: oops|pg||
pc|h4|nt|idc: obviously not, or there would be 34 fewer :)|pg||

pc|c5|nt|pkl: I did not quite get that heart play.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mugsmate: With that big heart holding, a trump lead at trick one was certainly tempting.|pg||
nt|henryb: I would X and hope not to miss a 5-3 @h fit|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|sn00py27: they had to play K@S I think to avoid squeeze|pg||
nt|eggy: I sadi that about the defence a few moments ago and was proved wrong :(|pg||

nt|bobholl: same as before :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the Irish in 6@D on board 2, i am told|pg||
nt|athene: so that's 2 slam swings out of 2 so far!|pg||
nt|pkl: In a pairs competition, ending in NT would pay very well. Here 4@H is the winner|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if you are not strong enough to bid spades later, of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt:  looks like|pg||
nt|idc: I see on board 2, Scotland played 3NT and Ireland found the @d lead, so 13 IMPs to them|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D looks like DONT |pg||
nt|sybarra: @D and higher suit |pg||
nt|henryb: is 2@d @d and another or a transfer?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure|pg||
nt|sharkirl: multilandy?|pg||
nt|henryb: maybe our operator can tell us?|pg||
nt|bobholl: nicely done isn't it ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@c = natural or any 15-17 nal|pg||
mb|1S|nt|henryb: that is a sound 2@s overcall|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: will E just punt 3nt here, and pray?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: we need an undo? - 2@C from East, rather than South|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that sort of thing doesnt usually happen in the first half of the set|pg||
nt|athene: stayman now, and pass 2@H?|pg||
nt|rnc: Yes, you're quite right , Catherine. South will either be squeezed or, if playing !K, East will set up a @D-trick|pg||
nt|rnc: !K = @DK :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: N might believe the 7 card @S suit=  trumps|pg||
nt|henryb: I would NOT double 2@s with only three trumps|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is it "cards"  top of bid?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not my X either|pg||
nt|jallerton: 15-17 balanced|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mamos: sorry about connection problems|pg||
nt|henryb: E-W make 2N or 3@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: not only is 3h icy but on a spade lead 4h is cold|pg||
nt|mamos: im told South made 2@H +2 on Board 5 we missed|pg||
nt|mug: 3@D does not sound like a balanced 19 count|pg||
nt|mug: but she does have a difficult bid, I grant you|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would bid 2@H over 1@H with the north hand|pg||
nt|petepunt:  prefer 6@H for that|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North gets lucky|pg||
nt|idc: North never managed to get her AJTxxx suit in at all in the auction|pg||
nt|ahh: now north should bid 4@H|pg||
mb|6S|nt|petepunt:  6nt on board 2 was tough to make|pg||
nt|petepunt:  NI pair in OR possibly most experienced in event|pg||
nt|athene: i admit the north heart holding, whilst strong, isn't ideal -  you don't have a tenace where you can exploit being over the known length|pg||
nt|athene: but even so, the hand is good enough that i would get in there|pg||
nt|petepunt:  bur I would balance with 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: if south now avoids the heart lead   will be more difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not as big a problem as South would have|pg||
nt|dburn: better undo this auction|pg||
nt|mugsmate: needs a pass inserted, vugraph operator:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt:  9 tricks again -  but i was wrong last time :)|pg||
nt|henryb: Punch is having none of thei at Red|pg||
nt|mdgraham: club view important|pg||
nt|mug: this will be ok with correct play|pg||
nt|mug: there is no club view, she must play North for the ace|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but NT should really be played by East |pg||
nt|steshome: So if England get 25 here, they need both Scotland and NI to score less than 15, as both those teams are 11VPs ahead |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: a very comfortable contract here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: who put dummy down?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Suit quality is a factor for some players|pg||
nt|roswolf: provoking opps to bid a game which they might not have reached unaided is the downside of such pre-empts|pg||
nt|sn00py27: not to mention the 500 that was on offer from 4@H :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: True, but assuming South would have opened 1@D game was sure to be reached|pg||
nt|roswolf: a more telling point catherine!|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Hard to double 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: in my view east should bid 3h over 2s- amaybe a slight overbid but she is under pressure and partner needs to know how good those hearst are|pg||
nt|lestergold: partner knows that she is under pressure|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n is appaling|pg||
nt|henryb: I do not agree. she is at least an ace light for 3@h|pg||
nt|ady: best lead|pg||

nt|jallerton: but that relies on keeping your 1 of a minor openers fairly sound|pg||
nt|mug: ahem|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and if north bids spades enthusiastically, that can only help west|pg||
nt|athene: variable NT for N-S|pg||
nt|col3435: is West worth a double of 1@h, do you think?|pg||
nt|eggy: and get a club switch|pg||
nt|jallerton: We saw Fiona open a random 10-count earlier|pg||
nt|mug: not in the Kokish playbook|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt:  1@S will do here|pg||
nt|lestergold: that case is best forgotten quickly Mike|pg||
nt|mamos: might even be passed out|pg||
nt|henryb: E-W have more high cards but no suits and no tricks; N-S have suits but no fit|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you also bid 1@D 1@H 2@H with ax hxxx qjxxx Qx than it is difficult :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not a hand for anyone to make anything|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chessmaste: Not for me - and it will give the game away here |pg||
nt|pkl: Can you hear the snore? ;-)|pg||
nt|mug: many pairs play 2@C Drury by a passed hand, to show about 9-11 with a fit|pg||
nt|mug: very useful convention, saves getting too high when partner has opened a bit light |pg||
nt|steshome: 6 imps to wales on board 3.  Funny board|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: Drury is a bit of a Marmite convention I have found|pg||
nt|mug: 2@D is a dangerous bid but all in a day's work I think, practically routine|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes I agree with AKQxx|pg||
nt|jallerton: Should East have raised?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: west of course doesn't expect that her partner has so little wasted in spades|pg||

nt|sybarra: can probably get coffee,   |pg||
pc|c9|nt|petepunt:  3@S was possible with 2 aces,  but a bit thin for a slam try|pg||

nt|mamos: are NS too high already?|pg||
nt|lestergold: that case may end up with fornsic investigators in the cold case files|pg||
nt|henryb: the club lead will give away one trick, and eventually declarer will lead to the @hK for a seventh|pg||

nt|ahh: my friend Jules suggests its all part of a cunning plan  if you wait 5 mins before bidding or play the (lady ) opps begin mentally writing shopping lists  and before you all ...|pg||
nt|ahh: complain about sexism Jules (very nice LADY ) says is it gameswomanship |pg||

pc|cQ|nt|sn00py27: I wd probably fish out the 4 @S - not a success here |pg||
nt|lestergold: well maybe they are but they havent done anything wrong yet|pg||
nt|dburn: or beat 1NT a trick - not perhaps altogether wise for South to volunteer to play the hand rather than defend it|pg||
nt|ahh: coward |pg||
nt|pkl: ... but for the fact that it is probably true ;-)|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: a fit jump - i'm guessing|pg||
nt|jallerton: what's the other?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|col3435: I'd have the @s4 on the table in a flash, and declarer would be very grateful|pg||
nt|sn00py27: not sure our support for the lead will make West feel any better !|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In one sense North did well not to respond 1@S  |pg||
nt|mug: some care required in the play|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: doesnt really describe the hand that well though|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tejjyid: this looks safe enough - time for a quick cuppa|pg||
nt|dburn: but whether South or West bid 1NT, East was going to venture 2@h anyway|pg||
nt|idc: I was expecting a pass there, but EW seem determined not to miss any games|pg||
nt|bobholl: the other one as answer on weak 2 double ?:)|pg||
nt|mug: facing double of two-level pre-empt |pg||
pc|c4|nt|petepunt:  predict 13?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: with the NOrth cards opposite a 15-17 NT, 3NTdirectly is tempting|pg||
nt|jallerton: Must be Lebensohl to explain the jump to 4@s|pg||
nt|mug: so I think well bid|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: what does 2c mean?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 2d?|pg||
nt|sn00py27: puppet to 2@D which you can pass if weak with @D|pg||
nt|henryb: transfer to 2@d; start of possibly invitational sequences|pg||
nt|mamos: i think this is a good piece of convention but not sure Souths hand is suitable|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah hah|pg||
nt|sn00py27: or make invitational bids - 2@D over 1NT would be GF|pg||
nt|mamos: gladiator|pg||
nt|lestergold: but what is wrong with 1n soutgh is not weak|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|henryb: by a passed hand perhaps not the best use of the bids|pg||
nt|idc: they may miss some plus scores in partscore, but no games|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahh: they may go minus a lot too |pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: 1n struggles mainly because of bad break in dimaonds! |pg||
pc|c7|nt|asnuttyas: 1 @C ruff wont harm declarer - it's with her natural trump trick|pg||
nt|mug: ducking a spade looks natural but there is a danger of walking into a defensive cross-ruff|pg||

pc|h3|nt|eggy: not Mike Lawrences view though|pg||

nt|eggy: I think there is ahand where you get this auction and x with 4(@S)333 ..|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: only one spade ruff needed for ten tricks, so this has to go down as a misplay|pg||

nt|steshome: Yes, careless mistake|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

nt|ahh: lets see how high sam bids here |pg||
nt|ahh: i guess 4@C unless its artificial |pg||
nt|pkl: Very difficult hand W... could be inclined to bid 5@C|pg||

nt|sybarra: 1 nt by W?  or too good (they might play wk nt)|pg||
nt|henryb: they do -- see the last two hands.|pg||
nt|sybarra: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: i have 1 vote for 5 too |pg||
nt|ahh: i win |pg||
nt|idc: time to raise with a void for East - but to how many :)|pg||
nt|ahh: if you have played with sam before you bid 5 and hope you have enough for it to make|pg||
nt|idc: A 5@c opening would have been interesting - raising to 6@c would have been possible then?|pg||
nt|pkl: I believe there are thirteen tricks in a spade-contract|pg||
nt|henryb: I think that is within range|pg||
nt|sybarra: so in their range |pg||
nt|sharkirl: trouble here?|pg||
nt|henryb: North will bid. the question is what|pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks like trouble for either side |pg||
nt|mug: every time this pair has played this weekend I have the feeling they are overwhelming the opposition|pg||
nt|mug: but it never seems to be reflected in the scoreline|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: 6@D might well be on here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: 4@H or 3NT  good for E-W here but not trivial to reach|pg||
nt|petepunt:  west worth a raise  to 3@Hat some stage|pg||
nt|eggy: My copy ofhis book seems to have gone AWOL, so I am afraid I can't reference it|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@h probably = @h and a minor|pg||
nt|sybarra: if 2 @H is @h and minor,  S may bid 2 nt for the minor |pg||
nt|henryb: we will know shortly|pg||
nt|sybarra: "systems on" over interference or ???|pg||
nt|sybarra: I.e.,  being able to ask for minor?|pg||
nt|henryb: not over 2@h. not sensible|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is 3 @C pass or correct?  (which I doubt) |pg||
nt|henryb: might be|pg||
nt|jallerton: which pair?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: but was it well defended?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt just needs 4-3 spades or no spade lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: aha|pg||
nt|sharkirl: very flat match so far, all but 1 a push|pg||
nt|mug: Brown-Stockdale, they always seems to have a nice row of plus-scores|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: we have an extra pass in here, operator|pg||
nt|athene: need undo|pg||
nt|ahh: live by the sword  die by it |pg||
nt|pkl: Yes - I would open 5@C and raise to 6. Unless I saw both hands at once|pg||
nt|ahh: 6 is a reasonable bid in isolation |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the barrage will make things difficult|pg||
nt|pkl: 6C could win, I believe?|pg||
nt|idc: in isolation from the actual auction?   B->|pg||
nt|ahh: some bizarre trump reduction coup thingy |pg||
nt|pkl: Just ruff a lot of cards ... I believe the incomes are there|pg||
nt|idc: You guys are right I believe|pg||
nt|ahh: the only alternative is to play for singleton @C honour or KQ stiff|pg||
nt|idc: but hard for declarer not to just rely on single honour|pg||
nt|ahh: so west may find it |pg||
nt|pkl: Right. But I admit a lot of stuff would have to go well with the trump-reduction plan as well |pg||
nt|pkl: ... and it requires a little help from opps (the @D lead)|pg||
nt|ahh: ok  so you open 4@C  what does 4nt mean ?  what does 4@S mean    have you discussed them  does anybody ?|pg||
nt|ahh: 1 should ask for trump quality |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H or 3@H?|pg||
nt|steshome: The bridge now is of a different quality - the girls are playing really well and very determined|pg||
mb|4D|nt|col3435: well, this is fair enough|pg||
nt|mug: 2@H was fine, the diamond honours don't rate to be good cards|pg||
nt|mug: 3@S looks like an overbid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H presumably a high-card raise to 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: many pairs have ways to distinguish a good 2H raise from a nuisance raise over doublke|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H might be a much weaker hand - it would be useful to have 2@D available as a good 3-card raise|pg||
nt|petepunt:  2@d best used as a 8-10 3 card raise|pg||
nt|tejjyid: My least favourite standard auction|pg||
nt|tejjyid: SOuth's pass is very conservative |pg||
nt|athene: i wouldn't be happy as south about never showing the most important feature of my hand - my spade fit|pg||
nt|eggy: 4@S is doubled on 21 in the closed|pg||
nt|henryb: East would have done better to switch to a @s after cashing her club, but ...|pg||
nt|pkl: For me 4NT natural, 4S cue. No way to end in a major after the preempt.|pg||
nt|henryb: I would play 3@c = @c and 2N = what minor|pg||
nt|sybarra: wasnt sure you would play that over interference,  but makes more sense than bidding 2 nt |pg||
nt|sharkirl: me too Henry|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was my first instinct also Henry |pg||

nt|sybarra: so they much have a meaning for 2 nt |pg||
nt|henryb: both majors lie well for declarer, so probably will make even with a trump lead|pg||
mb|4S|nt|tejjyid: North might still have a 6 card @S suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: no ambition today|pg||
nt|sn00py27: +1 ......... next !!|pg||
nt|col3435: heh. I expect I'd repeat this auction though. How would you get to game?|pg||
nt|lestergold: what i think i said at the time|pg||
nt|sn00py27: if 2@H GF, wonder why not a splinter with W|pg||
nt|lestergold: in any case this does not look like a hand likely to ive rise to any embarrasin post mortems|pg||
nt|ady: looks like win and try a heart switch    east should p lay the clubs to guard against 4-0 when the heart finesse wins|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt:  when playing 5 card majors and strong nt after x|pg||
nt|athene: the way the bidding went, west might have taken a view and bid game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S seems quite s stretch to these timid eyes :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3NT has little chance on a spade lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: that may well be an overbid but it should work|pg||
mb|4N|nt|athene: yes, 3@S looks very aggressive|pg||

nt|ahh: so you can sign off with rubbish trumps|pg||
nt|mug: Nelson might have doubled 4@S, as indeed 6@D might have been doubled a few boards ago|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnc: Seems to reach it now...or at least on their way|pg||
nt|mug: England need 25 VPs, those won't come anyway if the Welsh bid and make ambitious contracts|pg||
nt|mug: sometimes go wrong least when one expects however|pg||
mb|5N|nt|petepunt:  a good "save" here|pg||
nt|steshome: Umm, I'd have doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if you are going to use those spades for ruffing hearts, you can't count the 8 hcp for AKJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if W shows a good raise, E is worth at least a game invitation|pg||
nt|petepunt:  Lizcummins struggles with the concept of the pass card :)|pg||
nt|henryb: 2N is probably a game-interested hand|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ady: club to ace now|pg||
nt|idc: so you bid suit below the one you need a control in|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: looks to be at least 2 off|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they needed to double 6@D, given what happened at the other table - 3@Hx= for 530|pg||
nt|mug: declarer's going to find the spades anyway after the double of 1@D|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes, a curious gain for Wales|pg||
nt|mug: and with respect to the Welsh East, it's not like Meckstroth is at the helm|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West is declarer|pg||
nt|steshome: Or west even|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: nice|pg||
nt|rnc: Well done!|pg||
nt|sybarra: esp. over wk nt |pg||
nt|mug: 3@C was an appalling bid, potentially into a death trap|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 11 tricks look icy|pg||
nt|mug: if East wanted to bid again the call was "double"|pg||
mb|p|pc|c2|nt|athene: 1@H (X) 2@D! (2@S) 3@D game-try would get them there|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she seemed to wield it quite easily twice when NS were cold for slam|pg||
nt|mug: ah well, perhaps Kath was impressed by the sound technique on board 6|pg||

nt|lestergold: another coffee break hand we need a couple of these after the recent excitmenet|pg||
nt|henryb: a trivial 4@h for N-S|pg||
nt|dburn: a couple more small swings to England when 3NT went one down rather than three, and 3@h made where 2@h failed in this room|pg||
nt|henryb: another partscore hand|pg||

nt|athene: well 1@D will certainly get them there!|pg||
nt|mamos: Making 2@D was worth 7 imps to England as 1NT went 2 off|pg||
nt|dburn: but they add up to a useful lead for England, who could do with a win if they are to challenge for the Lady Milne trophy|pg||
nt|ahh: transfer anti cue bids   whatever next  bidding 2@C after 1nt to ask for majors  i ask you |pg||

nt|jallerton: 1 or 4?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: OK, not any more|pg||
nt|idc: Scotland gained 10 IMPs on Bd 7, but that last board may see the lead only temporary|pg||

nt|marlowepi: yes, that is the easiest way to survive a misguess in trumps....stay low:)|pg||
nt|athene: really 4@H? or are we just skipping to the final contract?|pg||

nt|tejjyid: NOrth thinks 4@H is fit showing|pg||
nt|athene: responding 4@H at your first turn with that south hand expresses doubt as to partner's constructive bidding, i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: south's off shape double may complicate matters for everyone|pg||
nt|henryb: in my book 2@c is natural, nf and not particularly encouraging|pg||
nt|sn00py27: assuming it would be natural |pg||
nt|roswolf: another poor decision except tracy seems to have jumped into the fire|pg||

nt|athene: even if 4@H were fit-showing, surely you pass with @HKxx?|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Red save in 4S one off against 4H here due to the side fit in diamonds. In practise no-one could come in, let alone diagnose the double fit.|pg||

nt|mug: I think 1@H was best|pg||
nt|jallerton: I'm not sure that the Butler is particularly relevant, Sarah.  It is a teams event.|pg||

nt|lestergold: again a pretty easy 4h this time for e/w|pg||
nt|mug: but you also have stiff spade with the doubleton trump|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: when the defence could run nine minor-suit tricks against 1NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Mercy ruling|pg||
nt|athene: E-W might be in trouble here|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D is natural?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe 2 suited?|pg||
nt|athene: it might be diamonds + higher - that's a common form of run-out after 1nt x|pg||
nt|athene: south now waits hopefully for the takeout-double|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I doubt SOuth has much hope left|pg||
nt|roswolf: england need to pull their socks up and score some imps otherwise they will lose this match badly|pg||
nt|sn00py27: or 3NT |pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    fairly low  |pg||
nt|pkl: ... well, it's difficult to find the right word for that bid|pg||
nt|ahh: not much excitement here  time to walk the dog |pg||
nt|idc:  ... keeping a little something in reserve ?|pg||
nt|ahh: pussilanimous |pg||
nt|pkl: But why D? |pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: the bad news of the4/1 trump break balancede by the favourable position of the spade K|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south might now bid 4@S, putting her partner with 55 majors|pg||
nt|athene: and being worried about clubs in 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s should play in 5@D quite easily|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: would rather open 1@d and rebid 3@C  |pg||
nt|steshome: Why start with clubs?|pg||
nt|mug: that would be standard Mike|pg||
nt|mug: and they may not take their ruff especially if you win in hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3@C is aggressive here|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S is reasonable enough...she has shown her hand by doubling i guess|pg||
nt|athene: but of course there are all sort of subtle misunderstandings possible here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I feel 3@S usually has 5|pg||
nt|mug: close|pg||
nt|jallerton: W might have preferred 3@c to keep other options in the picture|pg||
nt|bobholl: no room to find 44 @S :)|pg||
nt|steshome: That 3NT bid cramps the auction|pg||
nt|mug: so 4@C Stayman perhaps?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: assuming it's "standard"; i.e. game-forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this N hand looks a lot more like an overcall than did the S hand on   5|pg||
nt|henryb: On the lead of the @d3 a case can be made for playing low from dummy: North has only one higher card and S might have led high from many holdings including AK|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n just as good a spot|pg||

pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: the double seems dubious|pg||
nt|athene: east had better not rise with that @DK|pg||

nt|lestergold: good plahy of 7 clubs|pg||
nt|ahh: this is the downside of the comfort methods of telling p exactly what you hold |pg||
nt|mdgraham: should end in 3NT|pg||
nt|jallerton: 6@d is the spot|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: dummy's stiff D will be a very welcome surprise|pg||
nt|athene: this will probably go down|pg||
nt|athene: there are only two obvious losers (@DA, trump)|pg||
nt|athene: but south can overruff spades|pg||
nt|athene: if you draw three rounds of trumps you have a couple of spade losers|pg||
nt|athene: since north has that precious @S8|pg||
nt|athene: dummy is a bit short of entries to get the hearts going|pg||
nt|athene: she knows her partner has nothing, more or less|pg||
nt|bobholl: that has good chances :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6 @D only in W |pg||
nt|mug: this is also a decent contract|pg||
nt|jallerton: in 6@d can ruff a @h to hand after 3 rounds of @c|pg||
nt|mug: 6@D would be a real Challenge The Champs job|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H might actually have been the only making game?|pg||
nt|athene: a good example of how you want the weaker hand's long suit to be trumps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and why bother? if a major is going to be 3-3, much better for it to be spades|pg||
nt|athene: because it's useless otherwise|pg||
nt|athene: yes, sure|pg||
nt|pkl: What would you lead from KJT - the T?|pg||
nt|mug: good final contract at least|pg||
nt|jallerton: may lead @sQ out of hand which S has to duck|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: now 11 tricks available|pg||
nt|idc: EW do|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mugsmate: Close decision to pass 2D - 2H certainly a possible choice by south. That Jxx in the suit on the right is a big turnoff though when spades aren't raised.|pg||
nt|ahh: you also tell an astute declaress|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: i dont think 4H makes on best defense, does it?|pg||
nt|athene: i was just wondering...i thought it might come home, but maybe not|pg||
nt|jallerton: though N may be squeezed in red suits|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|idc: declaress - I like that|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: the diamond lead was not well conceived. W should lead a trump|pg||
nt|athene: to be fair, it was just about possible for west to have the @DQ i suppose|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all W needed was the J|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: @CA works well here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: heart ace anbd a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will play @SAK, ruff, and lose the three obvious tricks, i imagine|pg||
nt|idc: In case East has Kxx @h, it may have been right to duck a heart after just one round of trumps|pg||
nt|ahh: i heard an appalling story of an international ladies team   who i will not name   that had the practice of playing high low from dummy to tell p  its ok  we are in the right ...|pg||
nt|ahh: contract |pg||
nt|sybarra: we must be stuck|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: director called|pg||

nt|sybarra: and operator has no way to show what happens, since bbo will NOT let you reneg. |pg||
nt|henryb: and quite right BBO is|pg||
nt|henryb: eventually the operator will give us a result by having declarer claim|pg||
nt|sybarra: so much easier if real life was that way |pg||

nt|mug: I would be giving it at least ten minutes|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would think 7 minutes :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: any plain suit W might lead would be pretty much a shot in the dark. at least when you lead a trump you know what your goal is, and that your lead is a step toward that goal|pg||
nt|idc: since you need trump entries to N to ruff out & reach @hQ, but no harm done on this layout|pg||
nt|ahh: so when they didnt the defence perked up and defended like tigers |pg||
nt|jallerton: Very thoughtful for those watching on vugraph!|pg||

nt|athene: ah yes sorry you have @H @D @D @C to lose in 4@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: throw D on sapde|pg||
nt|henryb: and the point of testing hearts before playing a third club is?|pg||
nt|ady: e/w will make the obvious 5 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: W knows NS have no extras--no extra HCP and probably no extra trumps. There may be short suits in the NS hands, so a trump stands out|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think west had all that much to go on....partner didn't double 3@D but that was about it|pg||

mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|tejjyid: 4NT from South, sugesting the secondary @D suit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: if S makes a peep in @S,  she will be in 4 |pg||
nt|sybarra: or at least 3 |pg||
nt|mdgraham: declarer took @HA but not @HK and suffered the same defensive cross-ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: You might get to 7@D - it should make|pg||
nt|roswolf: now we will see|pg||
nt|henryb: I would open N 1@h. I WANT A @H lead!|pg||
nt|ahh: i thought my raises were thin |pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@h =4+@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: switch the five and ten of spades and 4S would go down|pg||
nt|tejjyid: X sugesting the @H fragment?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after the hes by S, N has to double|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right|pg||
nt|henryb: great minds|pg||
nt|sn00py27: as long as you play drury, partner won't get too carried away|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe they are playing 5 card majors|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  can be defeated   but Jagger might venture to 5@C|pg||
nt|ady: or 4@S |pg||
nt|ady: looks like e/w  not in bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: not easy for them after South opened that fine specimen|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Perhaps Jagger has no way of signing off in clubs now.|pg||
nt|mugsmate: If she did have I suspect she'd have done it by now.|pg||
nt|ahh: now 4@H ?|pg||
nt|mug: and 2@S showed?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south can't be very happy about 4@S getting passed out|pg||
nt|rnc: and might even pick some badly needed on 24|pg||
nt|henryb: no: a renege = failure to follow suit. a renege can be corrected if found before the side has played to the next trick|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: now she knows it was right to bid on|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@s = 4-card suppport |pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: East did well not to get over-excited - she does have quite a lot of HCP for a simple overcall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: really? she opened a rag. maybe all she lost is diff between 50 & 100 while anything by NS going for 300|pg||
nt|lestergold: but if i was openng i would still open a heart|pg||
nt|sn00py27: i like to show where I can take tricks and clubs are not going to be very fruitful :)|pg||
nt|ahh: superb |pg||
nt|pkl: 4@H is a very nice contract, and not an obvious one to reach|pg||
nt|ahh: see i can be nice  2 hands in a row as well |pg||
nt|idc: but for how long will that drain your milk of human kindness Jim?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: 4@S makes as the cards lie but that's very lucky|pg||
nt|eggy: true - could be 14 if NS bid 6D|pg||
nt|ady: some would dbl 1NT with west's hand  though not safe from a weak hand with east|pg||
nt|mug: by the standards of this event, it was a difficult contract|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: i love the understatement|pg||
nt|henryb: a revoke is after the reneger's side has played to the next trick|pg||
nt|bobholl: well the lead helps :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2008MindSportGamesBeijing%5CSystems/U-28/England/SusanStockdale_FionaBrown.pdf|pg||
nt|jallerton: for NS convention card|pg||
nt|jallerton: not a nice lead problem for West|pg||
nt|mug: but declarer will still lose two hearts, a diamond and a spade|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't think will make despite the helpfull lead :(|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: why not a cuebid from west?|pg||
nt|henryb: surely W should bid 6@d with all those controls, not 5|pg||
pc|d7|nt|eggy: but should lose on the ill-judged 5@H hand|pg||
nt|sn00py27: they are playing 5CM, that's why I said Mike :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: and indeed the opening bid have cost the defence a trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: as predicted|pg||
nt|mug: it's a long way short of Ladies European Championship standard, but still good practice for those involved|pg||
pc|d4|nt|steshome: Yes, I agree with that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@C seems rather pushy|pg||
nt|mug: 5@C I was about to say was a good bid|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: well it would be hard for E-W to double 5@C or 5@H i think|pg||
nt|athene: as the cards lie|pg||
nt|col3435: maybe unsure about which suit a cue-bid would be agreeing|pg||
nt|sn00py27: maybe she is thinking minimum, but with so many controls this is better|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 5@D very strange|pg||
pc|c7|nt|roswolf: yp east did well to bid 6 in the end|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: if the defence led trumps to stop a diamond ruff, declarer could just ruff the clubs good with the @DA as entry|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C was an alternative for West, over the double|pg||
nt|rnc: Even in game it will be 11 imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: this does not look favorite|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|eggy: good lead|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i thought we were talking about S's reaction to the passout, before she knows the layout|pg||
nt|chessmaste: She was facing 20-22|pg||
nt|pkl: Would any of you have bid 3@D with the S hand? I would|pg||
nt|ahh: am i allowed to say east bid like a Guy ?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|mug: West appreciated the value of her cards|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rnc: Needs quite a lot of mistakes by defense for letting this thru|pg||
nt|ady: not so easy for west to p  lay the queen   though cost nothing play having the 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could be down a bunch |pg||
nt|jallerton: Looks like the normal thing to do; just wrong double dummy|pg||
nt|jallerton: now needs an unlikely partial elimination against West|pg||
nt|bobholl: T of @H wrong :(|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: yes true but south still can't be that happy surely|pg||
pc|s3|nt|eggy: looks like only 9 on board 24 as CBAI are in 3@Sx|pg||
nt|roswolf: they wont be that generous|pg||
nt|rnc: and not likely|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mug: facing a black two-suiter|pg||
nt|mug: the only problem was that partner actually had a load of old tat|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps 4@C would have catered for that|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|sK|nt|eggy: not being very helpful at all in fact|pg||
nt|steshome: Or too many values in the red cards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. perhaps 2@S could have held a bit more. Partnership style |pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree with 5@c, though. Influenced by the East hand |pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: seemed to have lost the club ruffs|pg||
nt|steshome: It doesn't make any difference|pg||
nt|jallerton: needs W to have @dKJ10 and @h10xx|pg||
nt|bobholl: if T of @H in W a small @D now would do the trick :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|steshome: Not sure W needs the @D10, but need the heart position switched|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|henryb: perhaps the failure to cue either balck suit should promise neither or both controls|pg||

nt|lestergold: im happy with heart but pass i was saying was the sound bid with a bad 11 count and no suitable bid within ur system but i like to get the lead direction in this uis true|pg||
nt|sybarra: previous hand, push on the 3 nt  |pg||
mb|3H|nt|marlowepi: "thin" in HCP only--it is a very sound contract, almost laydown|pg||
nt|ady: light sshapely opeming from west|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps they can boot home 4@S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes true it's a good spot|pg||
nt|ahh: 2@S ?|pg||
nt|ahh: maybe not 2nd  in hand with 4@H|pg||
nt|pkl: Not at this vul, Jim. You werent serious?|pg||
nt|idc: I have a sneaking admiration for 2@s, but even for me it is too much|pg||
nt|ahh: surely south isnt thinking of bidding |pg||
nt|pkl: or am i being pussilanimous?? ;-)|pg||
nt|idc: because of 2nd seat & the vul, not the suit itself|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sn00py27: another opportunity for a lead directing bid |pg||
nt|sn00py27: are e/w 5CM ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: not vulnerable spade pener mandatory|pg||
nt|lestergold: opnere|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Kelly has a very similar hand to an earlier one. The hearts don't break any better this time either.|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: if E held Axxx Kx x KJ10xxx it would have been a great contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2@D perhaps from north?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: too hard for me|pg||
nt|eggy: which they will probably lose back on 25|pg||
nt|sn00py27: try again :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: opener its my keyboard sticking|pg||
nt|ady: may kee[ n/s out this time|pg||
nt|idc: good hand for 2@d Ekrens mind you :)|pg||
nt|ahh: i cant begin to describe my thoughts on 2@C   this is a family show |pg||
nt|pkl: At that vulnerability I prefer a somewhat  better suit - and not 4@H|pg||
nt|ahh: i have 14 points  i must bid |pg||
nt|pkl: I would have passed the S hand, but 2@C might work well even if you don't like it.|pg||
nt|mug: indeed, when partner shows a second suit, doubleton king and a fourth trump is normally the dream holding|pg||
nt|jallerton: Should be a defender winning the last trick for tha really|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: south is a bit short of entries to her hand to use the clubs in 3nt|pg||
nt|pkl: No - Punch passed, so it will be 2@C S|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: as a clever sort of lead-directing 2@S bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if it means that|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|ahh: let the doubling commence |pg||
nt|idc: don't like 2@c either but it might lead to an interesting auction|pg||
nt|pkl: Argh... why D as East???|pg||
nt|idc: East should be thinking: where are the spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: discretion the better part by Nelson|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and will achieve a plus score|pg||
nt|lestergold: and e/w but it in a making 3s all sound stuff|pg||
nt|lestergold: buy it|pg||
nt|idc: and probably pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: declarer has six trumps, @SK, and @DA |pg||
nt|henryb: X presumably is "Don't" or something similar|pg||
nt|ady: a quick pass from west  before anything dire happens|pg||
nt|henryb: I would probably have tried 2N with N hand|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sn00py27: the only time I have ever gone for 1700 - I opened multi with 5@S to KQ10. Opps came in with 2S which only promised 4, raised to game which was a 4-2 fit and partner backed in with ...|pg||
nt|sn00py27: 5@H ..........|pg||
nt|idc: goodness, is this really happening?|pg||
nt|pkl: What??|pg||
nt|ahh: i can only describe this auction as undescribable |pg||
nt|jallerton: except In Australia where any excuse for a beer applies|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5s is a safer game here|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5@c|pg||
nt|steshome: Spades are 3-3 - easy make here|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps East's clubs were rebiddable?|pg||
nt|jallerton: If the defence switch to @c?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|idc: West can have QJTxxx clubs and nothing else, 3@h seems a little forward|pg||
nt|idc: or even JTxxx clubs and nothing else|pg||
nt|ahh: i have other words for 3@H    they have something to do with canine |pg||
nt|idc: stikll, you have to admit this is fun|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: can she set up a long heart to make this?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S is worth another call, i think--N could have:  xxx  Qxxxxx  KQx   x. i would double 3C to show extras|pg||
nt|athene: south has to attack dummy's entries|pg||
nt|athene: to prevent declarer ruffing the hearts good and getting back to them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and above all (still on the last hand), if S had stiff spade king, wouldnt she have at least thought a long time about playing three rounds of clubs, since pd could uppercut ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dummy's ace if N had spade ten or jack?|pg||
nt|eggy: Did well I think, to heed the gypsy's warning - I can't imagine Tracy passing 2S|pg||
nt|henryb: makes 4 without an immediate @d shift|pg||
nt|sn00py27: dummy must have been a welcome sight|pg||
nt|mdgraham: should be an easy make|pg||
nt|jallerton: alternatively there is the threat of a trump promotion|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 rounds of @D kills the contract :)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|henryb: makes 4 without an immediate @d shift|pg||
pc|sA|nt|idc: if the specs had to watch our auctions, they would be bored|pg||
nt|ahh: last 5 boards double figure swings  this could be more of the same |pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahh: nice hand partner wheres the 1 you held in the bidding ?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: no further interest pray for fast claim before we all fall asleep|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Marvellous|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|ahh:  nice try |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: no!|pg||
nt|idc: On Bd 11, Scotland found 5@d sacrifice, pushing Ireland to 5@h -1, so 11 IMPs to Scotland|pg||
nt|ahh: ? 5 is stiff must be a mistake |pg||

nt|ahh: just lose 2 aces |pg||
nt|idc: restricted choice situation in trumps, declarer got ti wrong|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: now declarer draws trumps and plays a heart, if she reads the cards correctly|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tejjyid: the clues were there...|pg||

nt|athene: and south is out of diamonds|pg||
nt|eggy: Although she might make 9 tricks I suppose|pg||
