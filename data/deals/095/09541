nt|steshome: Hello all|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: just a little joke from the operator? :)|pg||
nt|mug: 1@S from North, 2@C South, 2@H North, 3@D South, 3@S North, 3NT South perhaps?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@S-2@c-2@H-3NT perhaps|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stayman was not out of the question|pg||
nt|athene: not only is it safe, but east gets to make two discards which might be helpful|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you were right in a way about the auction Bill. it was passed out. after the opening bid, that is :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes, stayman was a possibility with the north hand (intending to pass any rebid from opener)|pg||
nt|dburn: 1NT alerted - may be forcing, I guess, but about 2@c I am not sure|pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: south is bidding a lot|pg||
nt|eggy: Just when West thought it was starting to look good|pg||
nt|henryb: then 2@h = pass or correct|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe South thinks it's a transfer and North doesn't|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case the final contract could be somewhat less than elegant|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Your commentators are Marshall Lewis and William Frisby|pg||

mc|11|nt|Walddk7: Player names please operator|pg||
nt|athene: south has a very nice hand, even if she doesn't have a name yet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: usually they make it through a few hands before they play anonymously|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a LOT off|pg||
nt|eggy: quite a poor bid by east on reflection|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Macros are great|pg||

mb|1D|nt|marlowepi: what is everyone thinking about?|pg||
nt|athene: dummy doesn't have what West is hoping for in 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome Mike|pg||
nt|sn00py27: hi|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@H looks normal|pg||
nt|henryb: Mike. May your addition errors make little difference and your spelling be reasonable|pg||
nt|lestergold: no chanse of that Hnry and 2+2=5 in my maths |pg||
nt|Walddk4: I have more than 700|pg||
nt|idc: ah, about the same number of working brain cells I have left - it is no contest between them |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hi Roland and all |pg||
nt|sn00py27: hi|pg||
nt|henryb: your favorite 20-20, Roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Redbl here is I think a single suited rescue|pg||
nt|pkl: North has a difficult decision here - double or show hearts. No macro could solve that one, Roland|pg||
nt|idc: West will bid 2@c and East then reveals her suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: most likely a @c raise |pg||
nt|sybarra: also exploring for nt,  but 3nt be 1 too high|pg||
nt|mug: South must pass, any action zero|pg||
nt|mug: if partner can't bid over 1@S NS have nothing on, and EW may have a better contract|pg||
nt|mug: 1@D I meant|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Standing before the last round: 1. Northern Ireland 76 - 2. Scotland 74 - 3. England 61|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwww|pg||
nt|athene: although if north leads her partner's suit that will help|pg||
nt|athene: ouch|pg||
nt|mug: ok well judged by Mrs Nelson|pg||
nt|Walddk5: So realistically, only NI and Scotland can win the trophy from here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Scotland take on CBAI|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: very hard to disagnose though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E took a real chance here...|pg||
nt|ady: tranfer to hearts     likely down 2 at 2 level|pg||
nt|dburn: may be one major, rather than a transfer|pg||
nt|mdgraham: web site at http://www.cbai.ie/|pg||
nt|mug: so if England score 25, not unlikely against bottom-placed Wales, they get up to 86 VPs|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: north was doing the thinking :) i doubt east had to think too hard about that one|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure the auction should be taking this long|pg||
nt|dburn: not particularly sound whatever it is, mind|pg||
nt|dburn: still, no one can ever double anyone for penalties nowadays|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rnc: This one will for sure be cheaper|pg||
nt|henryb: you are obviously not an accountant.|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i do have an oxford maths degree if it was cambrisge then id be able to add up|pg||
nt|henryb: Pender thinks she has died and gone to heaven|pg||
nt|lestergold: in oxford they only taught me how to punt|pg||
nt|mamos: horses or skiffs?|pg||
nt|henryb: there is a story of the CEO who wanted to find out what 2+2=|pg||
nt|henryb: He called in his economists. they said 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: without birth control 2+2 can equal quite a lot|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|roswolf: i might have bid something over 1@C as east|pg||
nt|sybarra: although, might have the timing on a @H lead |pg||
nt|mug: would need specific results from the other two matches|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sn00py27: I thought we might get an idea on this hand whether they play weak or strong NT :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In these times many East's would open - especially with an eye on the vulnerability|pg||
nt|sn00py27: E/W|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this should be easy enough|pg||
nt|idc: I think I like 2NT by South now - she has a little too much to give up on game|pg||
nt|pkl: 3NT really sounds like "STOP". Can West find the diamond lead?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: probably better to play in 7D. at least you go off only one when diamonds break your heart|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D must be showing something like north's hand - and south ought to be getting mildly excited|pg||
nt|col3435: some convention cards at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/lmteams.htm|pg||
nt|col3435: N/S play "Acol with 5-card majors and a strong NT"|pg||
nt|col3435: E/W card isn't there but I think they play strong+5 too|pg||
nt|sn00py27: Not quite Acol then !|pg||
nt|ady: this wont make    but n/s likely to make 8 tricks in 1NT|pg||
nt|idc: ok, or that gets the job done even more easily :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: the aces will take care of partner's @H+@C losers, however those two cards are split|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|col3435: well, yes. Seems like a contradiction in terms to me. But that's what they say.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: @SJ10 might be useful fillers...@DAK9 is great|pg||
nt|henryb: he did not like that, so he called in his information tech people. wait a moment they said, we will check on the computer|pg||
nt|pkl: Oh - no reason to worry. I bet we'll have eleven tricks in the sack in no time.|pg||
nt|idc: A pity that we didn't get a chance to see if West would find @d lead v3NT, Q best perhaps|pg||
nt|pkl: That is a nice lead ... looks as if i holds N to ten tricks|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: understandable that NS are hoping to create some action given the match score. but that 5C bid is infinitely more likely to widen the gap than to close it|pg||
nt|athene: East will be disappointed to get only her top trumps from here|pg||
nt|steshome: I understand that the standing before the last round is Northern Ireland on 76, Scotland on 74 and England on 61|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|sybarra: immediate @D hook |pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: admittedly you don't want to bid a grand slam when there is a chance they might not reach the small slam in the other room|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, so down two may show a profit, but there are easier ways to make a living|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: i am puzzled why N did not respond 2D|pg||
nt|athene: a 6-card minor is shorter than a 5-card major, for most people, these days|pg||
nt|col3435: (it probably just means "not 2/1 GF")|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: i am sorry to say|pg||
nt|eggy: good defence|pg||
nt|henryb: back they came. 4 they said|pg||
nt|lestergold: good start for Catherine|pg||
nt|henryb: he did not like that, so he called in the accountants|pg||
nt|lestergold: east may well be endoplayed more times thanm she likes for her visit to heavan|pg||
nt|henryb: What would you like it to be, they asked? :)|pg||

nt|Walddk5: hmmm|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: EW would probably get another trick if W continued spades, but that is not too likely|pg||
pc|s8|nt|marlowepi: but there is more to it than that. 2D has the advantage of announcing strength immediately also|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: i think with all those keycards for diamonds, south should not stop below 6@D after north bids 4@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suppose N was concerned about a rebid of 2H from S. but is 2D GF ion their methods? not normally in these countries, is it?|pg||
nt|athene: well, i don't know N-S's methods, but i am assuming Acol-ish, so things tend not to be forcing :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think both N and S are guilty of underbidding here|pg||
nt|sybarra: and grabbing the 9 tricks |pg||

nt|mamos: i think the hand was played rotated so op had problems  as it seems did the players and commentators|pg||
nt|mugsmate: That sort of multi makes me feel old. Routine when I was at university 15 years ago.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You are lucky, it makes *me* feel sick|pg||
nt|mugsmate: First in at favourable vulnerability is a good time to be a bit random, so long as your partner knows not to punish you.|pg||
nt|ady: if they get the club suit right then 3T will make|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: alerted as weak major, max 7pts|pg||
nt|mugsmate: The multi may be just what is required to protect that club queen.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that Multi may cause declarer not to get clubs right|pg||
nt|ady: Jagger may sacrifice in 4@H|pg||
nt|idc: - bottom right of screen button - and see how the boards play out there|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is not a slam,  e/w in game in major,  sac in @D for n/s?|pg||
nt|mug: although I did take delivery of a box of dubious quality wine yesterday |pg||
mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|marlowepi: N should not have that worry when S cues 5C|pg||
nt|roswolf: will south fancy this hand?|pg||
nt|sharkirl: 4s |pg||
nt|mug: perhaps your stake would be a Blue Nun Sarah?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: i would be tempted to bid 2@C over 1@H with East |pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT overcall?|pg||
nt|henryb: over an opening 1@s do you overcall 1N or double and bid 2N|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT for me|pg||
nt|sn00py27: opp passed hand I am happy to settle with 1NT|pg||
nt|henryb: I think I would double and bid 2N actually|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: anyone prefer 2nt instead of 3@D?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|mug: I do|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: east doubled 1@D intending to bid spades next and show a strong hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has announced a strong NT, and six is cold facing both round aces and diamond KQ, which is only 13|pg||
nt|chessmaste: South might protect |pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be finis|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1nt not unreasonable all acions are going to be distorted with this hand|pg||
nt|sn00py27: but I would do something with S - unless they play 2@C as conventional and she has no easy bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1n is the closest|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Just 3H. If you play this random style, you have to play it as a PARTNERSHIP. Jagger can't go to 4H when partner may be so weak.|pg||
nt|ady: 4H could be 500 or 800 |pg||
nt|dburn: trouble is, she still doesn't know which major her partner has|pg||
nt|mug: and I feel 2@H on the North hand was a bit passive|pg||
nt|steshome: Oh for you, a bottle of the finest liebfraumilch.  Actually, I'll take odds of 15-1.  |pg||
mb|5H|mb|d|nt|athene: she doesn't really want her next decision to be selecting a lead to 1@DX|pg||
nt|athene: it's a pretty good suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: she appears to|pg||
nt|dburn: if it turns out to be spades, 4@s might even be making|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Interestingly, north has shown 4-4 in the majors and south has shown 5 hearts, so there is no real reason to get the clubs wrong anymore.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but look what it has led to|pg||
nt|mug: so I lose either way Sarah?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@D was about to go two down|pg||
nt|steshome: :) I don't like this effort at catching up|pg||
nt|mug: usual story|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: south should bid 2c surely|pg||
mb|5S|nt|marlowepi: i wouldn;t need to be tempted. i would do it before temptation even arose|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i would not like to play the n/s hands at the 3 level but maybe that is why i am commentating these days|pg||
nt|henryb: yes, or double 1N would be my choice|pg||
nt|idc: All roads seem to lead to 3NT making here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Pass can be the hardest bidding card to put on the table|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I don't believe this|pg||
nt|steshome: What on earth is going on?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hmmm this auction seems illogical|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Enterprising and unlucky to find partner with most of her points in spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the drinks have been spiked|pg||
mb|6D|nt|athene: i assume West in fact didn't pass|pg||
nt|sn00py27: should make 3@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: she has the theoretical values for a double but hand is too top heavy for it for my liking|pg||
nt|mamos: Pass would be a field if partner had psyched|pg||
nt|henryb: partner is third hand at favorable ...|pg||
nt|idc: I guess 6@d is playable but a bit ambitious|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: No, it's mainly because you are not a woman|pg||
nt|roswolf: east has saved the opps bacon|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They won't allow you in even if you shave, Geoffrey|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it is probably getting tken out as indeed it was and then u have to show trhis limite dhand at the 3 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: either South or West probably bid 1@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you dont want a spade lead from Txxxx or some rubbish against 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: presumably south denied 4 spades by bidding 2nt|pg||
nt|sn00py27: as 8 counts go - it is quite decent|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes has the 2 extra 9's|pg||
nt|lestergold: even more reason to bid a quiet 2 clubs|pg||
nt|mamos: i like 2C because if partner is light you have tolerance for @S and no great harm is done|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate this hand was always likely to finish where it has|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: maybe N simply did the multiplication and made the bid that would complete the equation|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3@H I don't care for|pg||
nt|chessmaste: or 3@S|pg||
nt|sn00py27: me neither, was thinking of passing back to partner or 2NT|pg||
nt|mug: dreadful |pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: well, good old partner found a club lead anyway :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 3@S was very hasty|pg||
nt|col3435: yes it ought to be possible for N/S to scramble to their best fit after the Dbl|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3@S has two chances - slim and none|pg||
nt|col3435: but evidently a confident 3@h has its merits|pg||
nt|lestergold: and its infrangible|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mugsmate: Key moment|pg||
nt|ady: a lot of imps here|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Seems that only if south is exactly 3541 or 2551 does south have a singleton club. There are more shapes where south has 2 clubs.|pg||
nt|pkl: I don't find it obvious that you end in 3NT. 5@D looks also reasonable to me. |pg||
pc|c9|nt|henryb: I prefer impregnable|pg||
nt|pkl: ... or 4@S ;-)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: and 1NT or 2NT is a likely enough rebid for S|pg||
nt|ady: roof falls in|pg||
nt|pkl: Much more interesting than 3NT!|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mdgraham: definitely not one for the kids, this|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: 2 of @H for the club lead |pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|lestergold: a new one but be careful Henry some of these ladies are quite young |pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: it is not devoid of hope - defence may assist|pg||
nt|rnc: Due to the CC, a direct 2NT would have been xfer to @D - so this will presumably be their way to invite "1NT-2NT"|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: why didn't south rebid 1@S?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: a likely push |pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb: yes, well ...|pg||
nt|pkl: I'd ruff a heart in dummy ....|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos: North pleased to have lead .....not|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|pkl: ... but this one works better in practive.|pg||
nt|pkl: ...tiCe|pg||
nt|pkl: Now, S is endplayed. That singleton was not such a big asset anyway.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|steshome: Roland dispenses all the commentators with nice pills before the events - but I must say my stock has run out already|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: perhaps still a little shell-shocked from the previous board|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Perhaps Newell expected south to have six hearts.|pg||

nt|mug: the quality of bridge in this event has not been good, but we do have an exciting finish|pg||

mb|2H|nt|idc: And now West has an interesting problem|pg||
nt|idc: many pairs don't play penalty dbls of strong NT, we will see soon what they play|pg||

nt|idc: 2@c is majors & 2@d single suited major|pg||

nt|tejjyid: must be earlyin the AM|pg||
nt|tejjyid: before the 1st cup of coffee|pg||
nt|Walddk7: If all cards are exposed, they are all penalty cards|pg||
nt|Walddk7: And declarer can choose in which order they should be played|pg||
nt|tejjyid: contract should make then...|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: Laughter all round|pg||
nt|Walddk7: @CK lead would be a good start for declarer, so she will likely to choose that card|pg||
nt|tejjyid: @C K lead, followed by @HK |pg||
nt|tejjyid: then pitch all the @S |pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: Gordon having difficulty finding this in his book|pg||
nt|marlowepi: an unusual type of double dummy problem|pg||
nt|marlowepi: declarer cursing her luck "why doesnt this ever happen when we bid a dicey slam???"|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: We're skipping this awaiting a decision|pg||
nt|eggy: a bit wet that pass|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   inlikely to get into the auction    looks like 2@S  n/s|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@h would not be among my choices on that suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: that is tracy's style|pg||
nt|dburn: a couple of small swings to England in the first three boards - they might have been larger, but ...|pg||
nt|idc: East's 2@d here is no doubt equal length in majors - at least I hope it is :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: (glad p brought some @H's) |pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: North passed - we have some sound bidders on VuGraph today |pg||
nt|roswolf: will the rabbi'c rule be applied?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: this is the 13 penalty card hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: rabbi's|pg||
nt|chessmaste: he's not playing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but maybe NS play differently|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: south did indeed open 2@C on the 4@S-7@H hand and duly reached slam|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room|pg||
nt|tejjyid: played without penaly, apparently|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room, north led a heart|pg||
nt|athene: i would certainly prefer a spade from those two suits|pg||
nt|marlowepi: which at llong last i understand. this event is the Home Internationals, and most  accidents  happen at home|pg||
nt|athene: then declarer played @CA and viewed to duck on the next round|pg||

nt|eggy: still - it shouldn't be too taxing to defend|pg||
nt|idc: as long as declarer keeps trumps control tight, it should be making|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: then throw another club on the @D10?|pg||

nt|rnc: Yes, you're quite right , Catherine. South will either be squeezed or, if playing !K, East will set up a @D-trick|pg||

nt|henryb: E-W make 2N or 3@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: not only is 3h icy but on a spade lead 4h is cold|pg||
nt|mamos: im told South made 2@H +2 on Board 5 we missed|pg||
nt|mug: 3@D does not sound like a balanced 19 count|pg||
nt|mug: but she does have a difficult bid, I grant you|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: i would bid 2@H over 1@H with the north hand|pg||
nt|petepunt:  prefer 6@H for that|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North gets lucky|pg||
nt|idc: North never managed to get her AJTxxx suit in at all in the auction|pg||
nt|ahh: now north should bid 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt:  6nt on board 2 was tough to make|pg||
nt|petepunt:  NI pair in OR possibly most experienced in event|pg||
nt|athene: i admit the north heart holding, whilst strong, isn't ideal -  you don't have a tenace where you can exploit being over the known length|pg||
nt|athene: but even so, the hand is good enough that i would get in there|pg||
nt|petepunt:  bur I would balance with 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: if south now avoids the heart lead   will be more difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not as big a problem as South would have|pg||
nt|dburn: better undo this auction|pg||
nt|mugsmate: needs a pass inserted, vugraph operator:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt:  9 tricks again -  but i was wrong last time :)|pg||
nt|henryb: Punch is having none of thei at Red|pg||
nt|mdgraham: club view important|pg||
nt|mug: this will be ok with correct play|pg||
nt|mug: there is no club view, she must play North for the ace|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but NT should really be played by East |pg||
nt|steshome: So if England get 25 here, they need both Scotland and NI to score less than 15, as both those teams are 11VPs ahead |pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: a very comfortable contract here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: who put dummy down?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Suit quality is a factor for some players|pg||
nt|roswolf: provoking opps to bid a game which they might not have reached unaided is the downside of such pre-empts|pg||
nt|sn00py27: not to mention the 500 that was on offer from 4@H :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: True, but assuming South would have opened 1@D game was sure to be reached|pg||
nt|roswolf: a more telling point catherine!|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Hard to double 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: in my view east should bid 3h over 2s- amaybe a slight overbid but she is under pressure and partner needs to know how good those hearst are|pg||
nt|lestergold: partner knows that she is under pressure|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n is appaling|pg||
nt|henryb: I do not agree. she is at least an ace light for 3@h|pg||
nt|ady: best lead|pg||
nt|mug: so @SQ and duck a round for luck|pg||

nt|dburn: ought to lead a low heart rather than an honour if she leads one at all, but this diamond may well prove effective|pg||

nt|ahh: but like all players cant resist the lure of 3nt |pg||

nt|lestergold: pushing them to 4h which as we can see cn make on a spade lead|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Good lead - partner hadn't doubled stayman & the opponents have a major each...|pg||

nt|henryb: I think 4@h is cold on any lead, Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: u dont double one game in ordeer to push them into one u cant double|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes u are right henry |pg||
nt|sn00py27: that J@C onside will allow a discard whatever the lead I think|pg||

nt|henryb: boring hand. eventually declarer will come to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sharkirl: yes|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|henryb: and I think N was wrong to double 3N, a contract she thinks she can beat|pg||
nt|lestergold: dims cant be enjoyed thru comunications lack|pg||
nt|sn00py27: I would have sat happily defending 3NT as North :)|pg||
nt|henryb: no more; no less|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe an up trick? |pg||
nt|mug: I think Scotland and Northern Ireland both have to be held to much less than 15 Sarah|pg||
nt|mug: hence the 20/1 which was not generous|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: i think "9 tricks" is a safer prediction this board|pg||
nt|Walddk7: She thought she was dummy|pg||
nt|ahh: Sam Punch has become one of Scotlands most thoughtful players |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: why duck and let thyem attack diamonds|pg||
nt|idc: I'm guessing that's a euphemism|pg||
nt|henryb: not a chance|pg||

pc|d4|nt|sn00py27: good effort the 10@S - they can see those clubs setting up|pg||
nt|mamos: better to double 3NT if you think you can beat 4@H :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry folks but this hand is one error after another ladies getting tired|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: i remember one time i was playing in a local duplicate and partner was on lead|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|dburn: may be down only one - can endplay either opponent, but not for nine tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hi henry shirley michael|pg||
pc|d2|nt|henryb: Just in time to finish a hand that was more interesting in the bidding than in the play|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: and looked enquiringly at me (as in, to see if i had any questions)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this line by declarer is not so precise|pg||
nt|athene: and i said "small please, partner" without thinking|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|sybarra: so only 9 as per Henry |pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: i guess i had been playing too many of them|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: but this has scrambled her communications somewhat|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tejjyid: the defense can tap dummy so thew @S suit is dead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: east can see that a dim switch is horrid why did she duck the first spade?|pg||
nt|ady: its easier to end play opps from here David|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dburn: understandable, though - she had to hope to make something of the hearts, and wanted to keep @sA as an entry|pg||
nt|mug: no harm cashing the hearts along the way|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: lol|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|steshome: None indeed|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d8|nt|lestergold: east has not spotted that the contract depends upon the simple finese of the ten of clubs well it did|pg||
pc|d5|nt|asnuttyas: N is beeing squeezed - so 10 tricks available|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|eggy: a bit unfortunate lead I suppose|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: it's usually a mistake in hands like this to allow the defence to draw a third round of trumps|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s6|nt|roswolf: a club lead would have been testing|pg||
nt|dburn: but things are getting progressively worse for her now, and three down may very well be the upshot|pg||

nt|tejjyid: well, maybe North won't open that hand next time|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes "very comfortable" contracts just don;t fetch|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Aggressive bidding is a good tactic if your declarer play has the gift of squeezing the extra trick out of things|pg||
nt|chessmaste: This might be interesting|pg||
nt|eggy: as the natural think would be to take the losing spade view|pg||

nt|mdgraham: well played|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and if north bids spades enthusiastically, that can only help west|pg||
nt|athene: variable NT for N-S|pg||
nt|col3435: is West worth a double of 1@h, do you think?|pg||
nt|eggy: and get a club switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt:  1@S will do here|pg||
nt|lestergold: that case is best forgotten quickly Mike|pg||
nt|mamos: might even be passed out|pg||
nt|henryb: E-W have more high cards but no suits and no tricks; N-S have suits but no fit|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: not a hand for anyone to make anything|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Not for me - and it will give the game away here |pg||
nt|pkl: Can you hear the snore? ;-)|pg||
nt|mug: many pairs play 2@C Drury by a passed hand, to show about 9-11 with a fit|pg||
nt|mug: very useful convention, saves getting too high when partner has opened a bit light |pg||
nt|steshome: 6 imps to wales on board 3.  Funny board|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: Drury is a bit of a Marmite convention I have found|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|athene: west of course doesn't expect that her partner has so little wasted in spades|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt would have worked out fine as well, even though they are off the club suit|pg||
nt|ady: can make 2@H  |pg||
nt|steshome: This is a fit-jump presumably |pg||
nt|mug: and how would you describe 3@D Steve?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|diumraid: Current in Running Scores are as follows  N-IRELAND  19,  ENGLAND  16,   IRELAND  16,  SCOTLAND 14, CBAI 14, WALES  11|pg||
nt|col3435: a spade lead might also give the game away|pg||
nt|sybarra: can probably get coffee,   |pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt:  3@S was possible with 2 aces,  but a bit thin for a slam try|pg||
nt|chessmaste: West will have an awkward lead against 4@H|pg||
nt|sn00py27: very dangerous with 4333|pg||
nt|mamos: are NS too high already?|pg||
nt|lestergold: that case may end up with fornsic investigators in the cold case files|pg||
nt|henryb: the club lead will give away one trick, and eventually declarer will lead to the @hK for a seventh|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: they will play 4@S now and just lose @H @C @C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this deal looks like a 2-bid auction to me|pg||
nt|ahh: my friend Jules suggests its all part of a cunning plan  if you wait 5 mins before bidding or play the (lady ) opps begin mentally writing shopping lists  and before you all ...|pg||
nt|ahh: complain about sexism Jules (very nice LADY ) says is it gameswomanship |pg||
nt|idc: Peter and I are too afraid to comment|pg||
nt|ahh: when i am the victim i begin to think about important things like beer and football |pg||
nt|pkl: I would say that statement of Jim was a most sexist one...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sn00py27: I wd probably fish out the 4 @S - not a success here |pg||
nt|lestergold: well maybe they are but they havent done anything wrong yet|pg||
nt|dburn: or beat 1NT a trick - not perhaps altogether wise for South to volunteer to play the hand rather than defend it|pg||
nt|ahh: coward |pg||
nt|pkl: ... but for the fact that it is probably true ;-)|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: a fit jump - i'm guessing|pg||
pc|c3|nt|col3435: I'd have the @s4 on the table in a flash, and declarer would be very grateful|pg||
nt|sn00py27: not sure our support for the lead will make West feel any better !|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In one sense North did well not to respond 1@S  |pg||
nt|mug: some care required in the play|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: doesnt really describe the hand that well though|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tejjyid: this looks safe enough - time for a quick cuppa|pg||
nt|dburn: but whether South or West bid 1NT, East was going to venture 2@h anyway|pg||
nt|idc: I was expecting a pass there, but EW seem determined not to miss any games|pg||
pc|c8|nt|petepunt:  predict 13?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: with the NOrth cards opposite a 15-17 NT, 3NTdirectly is tempting|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: what does 2c mean?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 2d?|pg||
nt|sn00py27: puppet to 2@D which you can pass if weak with @D|pg||
nt|henryb: transfer to 2@d; start of possibly invitational sequences|pg||
nt|mamos: i think this is a good piece of convention but not sure Souths hand is suitable|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah hah|pg||
nt|sn00py27: or make invitational bids - 2@D over 1NT would be GF|pg||
nt|mamos: gladiator|pg||
nt|lestergold: but what is wrong with 1n soutgh is not weak|pg||
pc|s7|nt|henryb: by a passed hand perhaps not the best use of the bids|pg||
nt|idc: they may miss some plus scores in partscore, but no games|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahh: they may go minus a lot too |pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: 1n struggles mainly because of bad break in dimaonds! |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: 1 @C ruff wont harm declarer - it's with her natural trump trick|pg||
nt|mug: ducking a spade looks natural but there is a danger of walking into a defensive cross-ruff|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: certainly 13 now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eggy: not Mike Lawrences view though|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: by which same token 8 tricks in diamonds becomes a tall order|pg||
nt|pkl: A tough lady, Mrs. Punch... |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|idc: mind you, on this layout and lead they have some play|pg||
nt|mug: ok now @HAK to stop any nonsense|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chessmaste: In some book I suggested a lead from a king was very dangerous - and a trump was also bad - plus underleading an ace was out of the question|pg||
nt|ahh: i can see 8  wheres theres 8 a 9th may appear |pg||
pc|s8|nt|sn00py27: maybe in pairs ok, but too dangerous for me at imps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and here it comes, I suspect|pg||
nt|steshome: Oh dear|pg||
pc|h3|nt|idc: good switch from North|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade switch neede to cut off heart trick|pg||
nt|henryb: much as I love aces, I might not open the N hand|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: now what  ace and @C ? |pg||
nt|sybarra: or H!?|pg||
nt|sybarra: *@H?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or J of @D?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: all possible, I gues it took me a while |pg||
pc|h4|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mug: nonsense a-plenty I'm afraid|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|idc: Oh, forgot about the 2@c overcall - still well done to her anyway|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: Henry with the greatest respect failure tio open a hand containing 3 aces is a hanging offence in these parts|pg||
nt|dburn: but declarer is giving herself plenty to do here, though she will probably survive|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: sometimes it is good to use conventions in close decisions, as it keeps you from forgetting them|pg||
nt|eggy: I think there is ahand where you get this auction and x with 4(@S)333 ..|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: only one spade ruff needed for ten tricks, so this has to go down as a misplay|pg||
nt|mug: good defence but declarer did not give the hand sufficient thought|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes, careless mistake|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahh: might as well pressure south before playing @S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: of course if you are worried partner is on the point of forgetting them, you have a knife-edge decision|pg||
nt|tejjyid: also if u r tired & emotional, process may be better than judgement|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Good! Going to Sanremo?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: use them to jog his memory, or avoid them in case he forgets? :)|pg||

nt|henryb: we will know shortly|pg||
nt|sybarra: "systems on" over interference or ???|pg||
nt|sybarra: I.e.,  being able to ask for minor?|pg||
nt|henryb: not over 2@h. not sensible|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is 3 @C pass or correct?  (which I doubt) |pg||
nt|henryb: might be|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: but was it well defended?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: 3nt just needs 4-3 spades or no spade lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: aha|pg||
nt|sharkirl: very flat match so far, all but 1 a push|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: we have an extra pass in here, operator|pg||
nt|athene: need undo|pg||
nt|ahh: live by the sword  die by it |pg||
nt|pkl: Yes - I would open 5@C and raise to 6. Unless I saw both hands at once|pg||
nt|ahh: 6 is a reasonable bid in isolation |pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: the barrage will make things difficult|pg||
nt|pkl: 6C could win, I believe?|pg||
nt|idc: in isolation from the actual auction?   B->|pg||
nt|ahh: some bizarre trump reduction coup thingy |pg||
nt|pkl: Just ruff a lot of cards ... I believe the incomes are there|pg||
nt|idc: You guys are right I believe|pg||
nt|ahh: the only alternative is to play for singleton @C honour or KQ stiff|pg||
nt|idc: but hard for declarer not to just rely on single honour|pg||
nt|ahh: so west may find it |pg||
nt|pkl: Right. But I admit a lot of stuff would have to go well with the trump-reduction plan as well |pg||
nt|pkl: ... and it requires a little help from opps (the @D lead)|pg||
nt|ahh: ok  so you open 4@C  what does 4nt mean ?  what does 4@S mean    have you discussed them  does anybody ?|pg||
nt|ahh: 1 should ask for trump quality |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H or 3@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: well, this is fair enough|pg||
nt|mug: 2@H was fine, the diamond honours don't rate to be good cards|pg||
nt|mug: 3@S looks like an overbid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H presumably a high-card raise to 3@S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|marlowepi: many pairs have ways to distinguish a good 2H raise from a nuisance raise over doublke|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H might be a much weaker hand - it would be useful to have 2@D available as a good 3-card raise|pg||
nt|petepunt:  2@d best used as a 8-10 3 card raise|pg||
nt|tejjyid: My least favourite standard auction|pg||
nt|tejjyid: SOuth's pass is very conservative |pg||
nt|athene: i wouldn't be happy as south about never showing the most important feature of my hand - my spade fit|pg||
nt|eggy: 4@S is doubled on 21 in the closed|pg||
nt|henryb: East would have done better to switch to a @s after cashing her club, but ...|pg||
nt|pkl: For me 4NT natural, 4S cue. No way to end in a major after the preempt.|pg||
nt|henryb: I would play 3@c = @c and 2N = what minor|pg||
nt|sybarra: wasnt sure you would play that over interference,  but makes more sense than bidding 2 nt |pg||
nt|sharkirl: me too Henry|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was my first instinct also Henry |pg||

nt|sybarra: so they much have a meaning for 2 nt |pg||
nt|henryb: both majors lie well for declarer, so probably will make even with a trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: North might still have a 6 card @S suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: no ambition today|pg||
nt|sn00py27: +1 ......... next !!|pg||

nt|lestergold: what i think i said at the time|pg||
nt|sn00py27: if 2@H GF, wonder why not a splinter with W|pg||
nt|lestergold: in any case this does not look like a hand likely to ive rise to any embarrasin post mortems|pg||
nt|ady: looks like win and try a heart switch    east should p lay the clubs to guard against 4-0 when the heart finesse wins|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt:  when playing 5 card majors and strong nt after x|pg||
nt|athene: the way the bidding went, west might have taken a view and bid game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S seems quite s stretch to these timid eyes :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3NT has little chance on a spade lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: that may well be an overbid but it should work|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, 3@S looks very aggressive|pg||

nt|idc: I used to play transfer anti-cue bids Jim|pg||
nt|ahh: so you can sign off with rubbish trumps|pg||

pc|h2|nt|rnc: Seems to reach it now...or at least on their way|pg||
nt|mug: England need 25 VPs, those won't come anyway if the Welsh bid and make ambitious contracts|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petepunt:  a good "save" here|pg||
nt|steshome: Umm, I'd have doubled|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: if you are going to use those spades for ruffing hearts, you can't count the 8 hcp for AKJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if W shows a good raise, E is worth at least a game invitation|pg||
nt|petepunt:  Lizcummins struggles with the concept of the pass card :)|pg||
nt|henryb: 2N is probably a game-interested hand|pg||

nt|ady: club to ace now|pg||
nt|idc: so you bid suit below the one you need a control in|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: looks to be at least 2 off|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they needed to double 6@D, given what happened at the other table - 3@Hx= for 530|pg||
nt|mug: declarer's going to find the spades anyway after the double of 1@D|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes, a curious gain for Wales|pg||
nt|mug: and with respect to the Welsh East, it's not like Meckstroth is at the helm|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West is declarer|pg||

nt|athene: a thin 4@H might be reached NS|pg||
nt|athene: you might survive a misguess in trumps if you can get diamonds going for a spade pitch|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a hand full of potential|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: sry - defence not quite on the right wavelength and made 9 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: that hand will leave a few scars on north|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: another coffee break hand we need a couple of these after the recent excitmenet|pg||
nt|henryb: a trivial 4@h for N-S|pg||
nt|dburn: a couple more small swings to England when 3NT went one down rather than three, and 3@h made where 2@h failed in this room|pg||
nt|henryb: another partscore hand|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: forgot to unblock the @D8 to win the beer card - poor show|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so doubling 4@S would have yielded a nice profit|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1@D 1@H 1@S 1N by NS uncontested, perhaps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a 3C opener by E could start some racket|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is a similar hand - Mighjt go 1@H -2 @D ; 2@H all pass|pg||
nt|athene: well 1@D will certainly get them there!|pg||
nt|mamos: Making 2@D was worth 7 imps to England as 1NT went 2 off|pg||
nt|dburn: but they add up to a useful lead for England, who could do with a win if they are to challenge for the Lady Milne trophy|pg||
nt|ahh: transfer anti cue bids   whatever next  bidding 2@C after 1nt to ask for majors  i ask you |pg||
nt|pkl: That 3NT on last deal gave scotland 10 imps|pg||
mb|1N|nt|tejjyid: OK, not any more|pg||
nt|idc: Scotland gained 10 IMPs on Bd 7, but that last board may see the lead only temporary|pg||
nt|mdgraham: tactical 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not that it is likely with 3 in each major and a mediocre suit and adverse colors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, that is the easiest way to survive a misguess in trumps....stay low:)|pg||
nt|athene: really 4@H? or are we just skipping to the final contract?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: safety play against wimping out later|pg||
nt|sn00py27: i would prefer 3@D by south or 4.....|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@D DOES SEEM RIGHT|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|athene: i expected 1@D to silence West :) but she was not so easily silenced!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrth thinks 4@H is fit showing|pg||
nt|athene: responding 4@H at your first turn with that south hand expresses doubt as to partner's constructive bidding, i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: south's off shape double may complicate matters for everyone|pg||
nt|henryb: in my book 2@c is natural, nf and not particularly encouraging|pg||
nt|sn00py27: assuming it would be natural |pg||
nt|roswolf: another poor decision except tracy seems to have jumped into the fire|pg||
nt|eggy: That seems a bit premature surely!|pg||
nt|roswolf: why bid?|pg||
nt|eggy: why poor?|pg||
nt|henryb: South really passed 1N?!|pg||
nt|henryb: that is wild|pg||

mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: Madden doesnt sound like an Italian name|pg||

nt|athene: surely East is worth 2@C if her partner can double 1@D?|pg||
nt|athene: even if 4@H were fit-showing, surely you pass with @HKxx?|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Red save in 4S one off against 4H here due to the side fit in diamonds. In practise no-one could come in, let alone diagnose the double fit.|pg||
nt|henryb: N-S are actually cold for 3N|pg||
nt|mug: West had too much playing strength to pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW can make 3NT and they might never get into the auction |pg||
nt|mug: 2@H or 2@S was required|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: more likely north was scared it was a splinter?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she thought splinter|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 2@C non forcing is popular - but not with Acol players:)|pg||
nt|col3435: yes this 2@c is an Acoly bid|pg||
nt|col3435: E/W aren't playing Acol but I expect that is the influence here|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: about to bid 3NT - shakes head and changes mind|pg||
nt|eggy: 5@Dx looks to be the par spot|pg||
nt|roswolf: north has been affected i think by the result on the previous hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: well n/s may beat par|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that sounds protective|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: and beating it |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: a very useful dummy. it is easy to construct one on which 4@h has no play|pg||
nt|pkl: Operator problem... 3NT north|pg||
nt|ahh: undo |pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: what is E worth if W can't double 1D but did anyway? most systems don;t cover that :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3@H will endplay partner - why not 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: lead holds it to 4 |pg||
nt|idc: defending 3nt would be too easy for NS :)|pg||
nt|steshome: England ahead now as E/W found their save on board 5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|henryb: but my book recommends transfers after the opponent's to doubles as an alternative|pg||
nt|ahh: @S lead 4 rounds @C next |pg||
nt|idc: those @d in dummy should give a clue to correct defence|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: so would atrump lead|pg||
nt|ahh: that @C in dummy should |pg||
nt|ahh: she is teasing us  will find this   just very slowly|pg||
nt|idc: I suspect I might get to 4@h on these cards, and that isn't a success either|pg||
nt|idc: I think I'd push to bid 2@h over the 1@s overcall as a passed hand|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Even with 13 penalty cards, this would be a tough hand to make|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Good method|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
nt|henryb: not badly as in DOIGB (Down One Is Good Bridge) :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: strange |pg||
nt|mdgraham: not really a save, as it wasn't doubled|pg||
pc|c2|nt|idc: and South would supoort hearts at some stage - maybe 5@d is still possible but tough|pg||
nt|pkl: So noone finds 5@D? The easiest contract to play, certainly ;-)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: statistically, the odds favor this not being the first time the potential ambiguity of this auction has come up. in that case S might have reflected that a response of 1H--however ...|pg||

nt|idc: only 2 IMPs in it|pg||
nt|pkl: ... but opening 3@C on last deal is .... |pg||
mb|1C|nt|marlowepi: The dragon team are off the schneid (scored their first IMP)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OK, there may have been other errors int eh128 boards, but that looks like the preventable one|pg||
nt|sybarra: Ireland probably needed that game |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, the pass off @DQxxx @CAKQ10xx worked out a treat|pg||
nt|lestergold: again a pretty easy 4h this time for e/w|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: when the defence could run nine minor-suit tricks against 1NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Mercy ruling|pg||
nt|athene: E-W might be in trouble here|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D is natural?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe 2 suited?|pg||
nt|athene: it might be diamonds + higher - that's a common form of run-out after 1nt x|pg||
nt|athene: south now waits hopefully for the takeout-double|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I doubt SOuth has much hope left|pg||
nt|roswolf: england need to pull their socks up and score some imps otherwise they will lose this match badly|pg||
nt|sn00py27: or 3NT |pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    fairly low  |pg||
nt|pkl: ... well, it's difficult to find the right word for that bid|pg||
nt|ahh: not much excitement here  time to walk the dog |pg||
nt|idc:  ... keeping a little something in reserve ?|pg||
nt|ahh: pussilanimous |pg||
nt|pkl: But why D? |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: the bad news of the4/1 trump break balancede by the favourable position of the spade K|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: south might now bid 4@S, putting her partner with 55 majors|pg||
nt|athene: and being worried about clubs in 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s should play in 5@D quite easily|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: would rather open 1@d and rebid 3@C  |pg||
nt|steshome: Why start with clubs?|pg||
nt|mug: that would be standard Mike|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: 3@C is aggressive here|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S is reasonable enough...she has shown her hand by doubling i guess|pg||
nt|athene: but of course there are all sort of subtle misunderstandings possible here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I feel 3@S usually has 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: assuming it's "standard"; i.e. game-forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this N hand looks a lot more like an overcall than did the S hand on   5|pg||
nt|henryb: On the lead of the @d3 a case can be made for playing low from dummy: North has only one higher card and S might have led high from many holdings including AK|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n just as good a spot|pg||
nt|mamos: ah so a variation|pg||

nt|idc: @hQ I meant|pg||
nt|pkl: Guessing hearts makes 4@S a winner.|pg||
nt|ahh: ok it needed @D lead to beat it |pg||
nt|idc: In theory, the J lead is highest honour, so she has a clue from the EW methods|pg||

nt|sybarra: on a @D lead this is more than dicey |pg||
nt|henryb: even on a low @d lead, declarer will surely try the @dQ|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: the double seems dubious|pg||
nt|athene: east had better not rise with that @DK|pg||
nt|sn00py27: the game that geoffrey and david wanted to bid on board 8 has got home - a winning spade got discarded|pg||
nt|sn00py27: 6 imps to england|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Very strange as up to that point West had discarded perfectly |pg||
nt|lestergold: good plahy of 7 clubs|pg||
nt|ahh: this is the downside of the comfort methods of telling p exactly what you hold |pg||
nt|mdgraham: should end in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: dummy's stiff D will be a very welcome surprise|pg||
nt|athene: this will probably go down|pg||
nt|athene: there are only two obvious losers (@DA, trump)|pg||
nt|athene: but south can overruff spades|pg||
nt|athene: if you draw three rounds of trumps you have a couple of spade losers|pg||
nt|athene: since north has that precious @S8|pg||
nt|athene: dummy is a bit short of entries to get the hearts going|pg||
nt|athene: she knows her partner has nothing, more or less|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@H might actually have been the only making game?|pg||
nt|athene: a good example of how you want the weaker hand's long suit to be trumps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and why bother? if a major is going to be 3-3, much better for it to be spades|pg||
nt|athene: because it's useless otherwise|pg||
nt|athene: yes, sure|pg||
nt|pkl: What would you lead from KJT - the T?|pg||
nt|mug: good final contract at least|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: now 11 tricks available|pg||
nt|idc: EW do|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mugsmate: Close decision to pass 2D - 2H certainly a possible choice by south. That Jxx in the suit on the right is a big turnoff though when spades aren't raised.|pg||
nt|ahh: you also tell an astute declaress|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: i dont think 4H makes on best defense, does it?|pg||
nt|athene: i was just wondering...i thought it might come home, but maybe not|pg||
pc|d7|nt|idc: declaress - I like that|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the diamond lead was not well conceived. W should lead a trump|pg||
nt|athene: to be fair, it was just about possible for west to have the @DQ i suppose|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all W needed was the J|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: @CA works well here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: heart ace anbd a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will play @SAK, ruff, and lose the three obvious tricks, i imagine|pg||
nt|idc: In case East has Kxx @h, it may have been right to duck a heart after just one round of trumps|pg||
nt|ahh: i heard an appalling story of an international ladies team   who i will not name   that had the practice of playing high low from dummy to tell p  its ok  we are in the right ...|pg||
nt|ahh: contract |pg||
nt|sybarra: we must be stuck|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: director called|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: east renaged on third diamond|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh dear |pg||
nt|sybarra: and operator has no way to show what happens, since bbo will NOT let you reneg. |pg||
nt|henryb: and quite right BBO is|pg||
nt|henryb: eventually the operator will give us a result by having declarer claim|pg||
nt|sybarra: so much easier if real life was that way |pg||
nt|henryb: it would simplify the director's job and reduce the number of calls greatly :)|pg||

pc|s7|nt|mug: nothing to do but start clubs from hand, @CA looks natural|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: any plain suit W might lead would be pretty much a shot in the dark. at least when you lead a trump you know what your goal is, and that your lead is a step toward that goal|pg||
nt|idc: since you need trump entries to N to ruff out & reach @hQ, but no harm done on this layout|pg||
nt|ahh: so when they didnt the defence perked up and defended like tigers |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is a deep game|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pkl: This is similar to "the congratulatory jack" which i read about in The Bridge World|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|athene: ah yes sorry you have @H @D @D @C to lose in 4@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: throw D on sapde|pg||
nt|henryb: and the point of testing hearts before playing a third club is?|pg||
nt|ady: e/w will make the obvious 5 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W knows NS have no extras--no extra HCP and probably no extra trumps. There may be short suits in the NS hands, so a trump stands out|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think west had all that much to go on....partner didn't double 3@D but that was about it|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South moving into heavy favouritism here|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont ask m i didnt do it|pg||
nt|sn00py27: better value for money for the spectators :)|pg||
nt|mug: should have unblocked |pg||

nt|steshome: Yes, I was just looking to see what happened.  I think it was a similar issue|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2C|nt|tejjyid: 4NT from South, sugesting the secondary @D suit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: if S makes a peep in @S,  she will be in 4 |pg||
nt|sybarra: or at least 3 |pg||
nt|mdgraham: declarer took @HA but not @HK and suffered the same defensive cross-ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: You might get to 7@D - it should make|pg||
nt|roswolf: now we will see|pg||
nt|henryb: I would open N 1@h. I WANT A @H lead!|pg||
nt|ahh: i thought my raises were thin |pg||
mb|2D|nt|marlowepi: switch the five and ten of spades and 4S would go down|pg||
nt|tejjyid: X sugesting the @H fragment?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after the hes by S, N has to double|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right|pg||
nt|henryb: great minds|pg||
nt|sn00py27: as long as you play drury, partner won't get too carried away|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe they are playing 5 card majors|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  can be defeated   but Jagger might venture to 5@C|pg||
nt|ady: or 4@S |pg||
nt|ady: looks like e/w  not in bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: not easy for them after South opened that fine specimen|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Perhaps Jagger has no way of signing off in clubs now.|pg||
nt|mugsmate: If she did have I suspect she'd have done it by now.|pg||
nt|ahh: now 4@H ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south can't be very happy about 4@S getting passed out|pg||
nt|rnc: and might even pick some badly needed on 24|pg||
nt|henryb: no: a renege = failure to follow suit. a renege can be corrected if found before the side has played to the next trick|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: now she knows it was right to bid on|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: East did well not to get over-excited - she does have quite a lot of HCP for a simple overcall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: really? she opened a rag. maybe all she lost is diff between 50 & 100 while anything by NS going for 300|pg||
nt|lestergold: but if i was openng i would still open a heart|pg||
nt|sn00py27: i like to show where I can take tricks and clubs are not going to be very fruitful :)|pg||
nt|ahh: superb |pg||
nt|pkl: 4@H is a very nice contract, and not an obvious one to reach|pg||
nt|ahh: see i can be nice  2 hands in a row as well |pg||
nt|idc: but for how long will that drain your milk of human kindness Jim?|pg||
mb|5C|nt|athene: 4@S makes as the cards lie but that's very lucky|pg||
nt|eggy: true - could be 14 if NS bid 6D|pg||
nt|ady: some would dbl 1NT with west's hand  though not safe from a weak hand with east|pg||
nt|mug: by the standards of this event, it was a difficult contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i love the understatement|pg||
nt|henryb: a revoke is after the reneger's side has played to the next trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: why not a cuebid from west?|pg||
nt|henryb: surely W should bid 6@d with all those controls, not 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: but should lose on the ill-judged 5@H hand|pg||
nt|sn00py27: they are playing 5CM, that's why I said Mike :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: and indeed the opening bid have cost the defence a trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: as predicted|pg||
nt|mug: it's a long way short of Ladies European Championship standard, but still good practice for those involved|pg||
pc|d5|nt|steshome: Yes, I agree with that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@C seems rather pushy|pg||
nt|mug: 5@C I was about to say was a good bid|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: well it would be hard for E-W to double 5@C or 5@H i think|pg||
nt|athene: as the cards lie|pg||
nt|col3435: maybe unsure about which suit a cue-bid would be agreeing|pg||
nt|sn00py27: maybe she is thinking minimum, but with so many controls this is better|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 5@D very strange|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: yp east did well to bid 6 in the end|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: if the defence led trumps to stop a diamond ruff, declarer could just ruff the clubs good with the @DA as entry|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C was an alternative for West, over the double|pg||
nt|rnc: Even in game it will be 11 imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: this does not look favorite|pg||
pc|cK|nt|eggy: good lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: i thought we were talking about S's reaction to the passout, before she knows the layout|pg||
nt|chessmaste: She was facing 20-22|pg||
nt|pkl: Would any of you have bid 3@D with the S hand? I would|pg||
nt|ahh: am i allowed to say east bid like a Guy ?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|mug: West appreciated the value of her cards|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rnc: Needs quite a lot of mistakes by defense for letting this thru|pg||
nt|ady: not so easy for west to p  lay the queen   though cost nothing play having the 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could be down a bunch |pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: yes true but south still can't be that happy surely|pg||
pc|cA|nt|eggy: looks like only 9 on board 24 as CBAI are in 3@Sx|pg||
nt|roswolf: they wont be that generous|pg||
nt|rnc: and not likely|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|mug: facing a black two-suiter|pg||
nt|mug: the only problem was that partner actually had a load of old tat|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps 4@C would have catered for that|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|eggy: not being very helpful at all in fact|pg||
nt|steshome: Or too many values in the red cards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. perhaps 2@S could have held a bit more. Partnership style |pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree with 5@c, though. Influenced by the East hand |pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: seemed to have lost the club ruffs|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|col3435: I suspect East was going to slam whatever happened. Finding diamond support is just a nice bonus.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|nt|henryb: perhaps the failure to cue either balck suit should promise neither or both controls|pg||
nt|lestergold: the club opener lets face it was pointless playing 5cm pass was the sound bid heart was the second best bid a slight lie club bid .....ugh     |pg||

nt|mugsmate: Difficult for the defense to credit this shape to north. Clever play winning the cQ as well. It hid the club position even better.|pg||

nt|sybarra: previous hand, push on the 3 nt  |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: "thin" in HCP only--it is a very sound contract, almost laydown|pg||
nt|ady: light sshapely opeming from west|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps they can boot home 4@S here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: yes true it's a good spot|pg||
nt|ahh: 2@S ?|pg||
nt|ahh: maybe not 2nd  in hand with 4@H|pg||
nt|pkl: Not at this vul, Jim. You werent serious?|pg||
nt|idc: I have a sneaking admiration for 2@s, but even for me it is too much|pg||
nt|ahh: surely south isnt thinking of bidding |pg||
nt|pkl: or am i being pussilanimous?? ;-)|pg||
nt|idc: because of 2nd seat & the vul, not the suit itself|pg||
mb|d|nt|sn00py27: another opportunity for a lead directing bid |pg||
nt|sn00py27: are e/w 5CM ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: not vulnerable spade pener mandatory|pg||
nt|lestergold: opnere|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Kelly has a very similar hand to an earlier one. The hearts don't break any better this time either.|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: if E held Axxx Kx x KJ10xxx it would have been a great contract|pg||
mb|r|nt|athene: 2@D perhaps from north?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: too hard for me|pg||
nt|eggy: which they will probably lose back on 25|pg||

nt|ahh: i have 14 points  i must bid |pg||
nt|pkl: I would have passed the S hand, but 2@C might work well even if you don't like it.|pg||
nt|mug: indeed, when partner shows a second suit, doubleton king and a fourth trump is normally the dream holding|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: south is a bit short of entries to her hand to use the clubs in 3nt|pg||
nt|pkl: No - Punch passed, so it will be 2@C S|pg||

mb|p|nt|eggy: discretion the better part by Nelson|pg||

nt|ahh: i can only describe this auction as undescribable |pg||

nt|ahh: i have other words for 3@H    they have something to do with canine |pg||
nt|idc: stikll, you have to admit this is fun|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: can she set up a long heart to make this?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S is worth another call, i think--N could have:  xxx  Qxxxxx  KQx   x. i would double 3C to show extras|pg||
nt|athene: south has to attack dummy's entries|pg||
nt|athene: to prevent declarer ruffing the hearts good and getting back to them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and above all (still on the last hand), if S had stiff spade king, wouldnt she have at least thought a long time about playing three rounds of clubs, since pd could uppercut ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dummy's ace if N had spade ten or jack?|pg||
nt|eggy: Did well I think, to heed the gypsy's warning - I can't imagine Tracy passing 2S|pg||
nt|henryb: makes 4 without an immediate @d shift|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: even if declarer led a club from hand to the @CQ you should probably duck with east|pg||

nt|marlowepi: yes i had actually worked out that W would raise hearts. the question was how and how many|pg||

nt|sybarra: X now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: not the most successful start I'm afraid|pg||

nt|marlowepi: give. the successes of "tactical underbidding" are measly compared to those of the red-blooded philosophy|pg||
nt|athene: sorry the diamonds were a bit weaker than i thought|pg||
nt|athene: i thought declarer had the @D9|pg||
nt|athene: it wasn't a trivial hand|pg||
nt|athene: but starting with @DA means you are usually going to lose two tricks in the suit|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Roland asked us to be very kind - did he have inside information?|pg||
nt|henryb: calling it a comedy seems to me to be kind!|pg||
nt|col3435: I liked Henry's underlead at trick two, that's a much classier way to let it through :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: NO just experience!|pg||

nt|ahh: no double of the stayman bid |pg||
nt|pkl: Yes. That D was not lucky|pg||
nt|sybarra: and they beat it |pg||
nt|henryb: I think North should work it out: if E had the @sA she would lead the first @s from dummy|pg||
nt|henryb: West, I mean|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahh: looks like 4@S can be made here |pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: 6nt or 6@C here i guess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S rightly promotes her hand to a 2NT rebid|pg||
nt|athene: a diamond lead might worry you in 6nt a bit - 6@C looks better|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 21 HCP but far better than that due to long chunky suit and all primes|pg||
nt|tejjyid: need to enlist the defence to help|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w had difficulty finding their 5-3 heart fit|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****   N-IRELAND 76, SCOTLAND 70, ENGLAND 61, IRELAND 60, CBAI 57, WALES 32  ****|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: on the @D10 lead, in 6NT, you probably play east for the @DK @SQ|pg||
mb|3C|nt|tejjyid: maybe just return a @H after trick one|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room|pg||
nt|eggy: CBAI collecting 5 more on 27|pg||
nt|pkl: There's been loads of swings this time. In part because of bad decisions by both pairs|pg||
nt|sybarra: some preemptive spade raise?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or just 2 @s?|pg||
nt|henryb: I would bid 4, but who am I?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: win @DA, run everything, and throw east in to lead a spade|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Yes, I asked commentators to treat the players with respect. I will stand by that view at all times whether you like it or not|pg||
nt|ahh: as usual 4 @H bid is a transfer |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: O'keeffe is with you |pg||
nt|mug: reasonable to try 3@S now|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@H is an underbid by some way i think|pg||
nt|ahh: to 4@S by opponents|pg||
nt|sybarra: but arriving undoubled |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: maybe not|pg||
nt|athene: need another pass in there|pg||
nt|tejjyid: check please operator|pg||
nt|pkl: I believe NS would have ended in 4@S anyway, but you are correct: 4@H makes 4@S almost a certainty|pg||
nt|idc: The Scottish declarer in the other room played a club to J, so lost 2 @c and a @d & @h|pg||
nt|idc: I guess it can be made with better guessing|pg||
mb|4C|nt|roswolf: and west gave them another chance|pg||
nt|sn00py27: I would dbl 2@C|pg||
nt|sn00py27: playing 4cd majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: north in the other room bid3@C |pg||
nt|roswolf: A GAME SWING IN TO ENGLAND|pg||
nt|sn00py27: if these are 5CM, I think 3@C with those good cards|pg||
nt|roswolf: makes the score more respectable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: did West really pas second in hand in the other room? Seems unlikely |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: heart lead would have been best|pg||
nt|mugsmate: I like the 2H opener in the other room. Those hearts look like 6.|pg||
nt|pkl: But @C to J is not a logical play considering the bidding at this table.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: bd 28  the other room played 4 @S successfully by n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: I think the 3@S was just the final contract|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: and S in 1st? lol|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: on a non-diamond lead, you just play @SAK and another, probably|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe---that line is transparent enough that--IN PRINCIPLE--E can make you guess whether or not the spades are now stiff queen (after spade ace)|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: i assumed it was some number of controls|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS live right. this dreadful contract is cold|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D = 0-1 control, 2@H = 2, 2@S = 3?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Having bid 2@H on the first round North might have recovered with a subtle 3@D on the next|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: (A=2, K=1)|pg||
nt|athene: but south obviously thought it was natural|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks infrangible and more imps to CBAI|pg||
nt|eggy: and with it perhaps|pg||
nt|sn00py27: i was thinking it looked pretty safe on any lead, although I would favour a @H - dummy is probably with 4@S|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: in the other room north never bid over a weak nt - must be losing tactics with a 15 count imo|pg||

nt|ahh: my lunch beckons so see you soon |pg||
nt|pkl: Bye Jim|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: well that lead solves a certain problem for declarer|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the "9th trick" problem...|pg||
nt|athene: namely, where trick number nine is coming from|pg||
nt|ady: england not so good OR    missed the 6@D slam   and were not in game on board 29 the board Jagger opened the multi|pg||
nt|ady: nite Jon|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu Henry,  and thx |pg||
pc|h8|nt|sharkirl: tks all|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: the next match is coming up shortly - in about 30 minutes, i think|pg||
nt|sn00py27: as well as some overbidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: just as overbidding was rewarded to ROI when they bid a bad 3n which couldnt be beaten|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East might have ventured 3@C, too. Partner is not broke on this bidding |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|ady: diamond back could be best    if that is ruffed  then very likely trumps will be breaking and diamonds can be set up|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx michael |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pkl: Now 2@H wins..... |pg||
pc|d8|nt|idc: Bye all|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||
nt|steshome: Oh well|pg||
nt|mug: West got the wrong end of the stick|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: will need to negotiate an extra club trick on this play|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mug: @SK is a nice deceptive play, encouraging declarer to play another|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: S retuirned her 4th best spade at Trick 2 as the books say one should. but probably not on this hand--to beat 3NT partner will need an entry--and even then where will we get 5 ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tricks? S should play back Q of spades hoping for a duck (correct if spades are 5-3), then if N turns up with only four spades (by following up the line), she can shift to diamonds|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|sn00py27: all she had to do on the last was cross to dummy' ace - finesse the diamond again and claim 9|pg||
pc|c3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mug: now @SQ and get out with a club, one off|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|eggy: should hold this now as South has show 15 points|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu all in about 40 min or so |pg||
