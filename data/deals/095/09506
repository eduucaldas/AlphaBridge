nt|chick: choice of slam bid|pg||
nt|werge: A bad decision to bid slam - N/S have indicated bad breaks|pg||
nt|phil: note that South is going to be endplayed after winning the @cK, which will negate one of the guesses - assuming declarer takes the time to eliminate diamonds|pg||

nt|bobh1: he probably figured--"why didn't he strip the hand?" . . . |pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: 6 @C seems to be lay-down. South is end-played after ruffing @D - and he must "give" away the @H-suit. Now it looks like a show-up squeeze against North - and that will tell, who ...|pg||
nt|werge: is in position of the cricial @S Queen|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|mariner1: 5@C DBL made so a big swing to Galim|pg||
nt|werge: crucial|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|phil: looks like 4@s which will depend on guessing the club Q (or maybe a misdefense)|pg||
nt|werge: You get an extra @C-trick, if South plays ruff and discard|pg||
nt|werge: As always: 3 NT is the contract...|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|phil: yes, 3N is excellent|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: And now it all depends on finding @CQ|pg||

pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mcarroll: True - give up the lead in @D and the opps have to help declarer|pg||
nt|werge: When East rises with the @D K, declarer will know - from the NOT-lead, where the @D Ace is -. and make the contract, West is endplyed|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|mcarroll: Sorry give a @H|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|phil: lose heart, diamond to King, diamond to Jack - if declarer plays for split diamonds, he can claim|pg||
nt|phil: right, strong inference on the non-diamond lead|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: @SJ is quite attractive here, but you cannot know that|pg||
nt|vugraphzmm: eamon made up this bidding |pg||
nt|greerm: I prefer dubious doubles against weak NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzmm: contract is 2@Hs by East |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cuttysark: Maybe North did pass and East used Stayman|pg||
nt|greerm: if they play strong NT in the other room it might go, 1@D 1NT ... 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzmm: thats the lead and we will claim at end of hand |pg||
nt|Walddk2: After North's double, N-S would be in a forcing situation in my book|pg||
nt|greerm: so hopeful for NI|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can't let the opponents play undoubled|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I suspect our strong NT pair will be resting after playing the first 3 sets, so it will be a weak NT there as well|pg||

nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: might be tough to bid game|pg||
nt|phil: 1@d or 1@s in North? |pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|mcarroll: 1@D for me|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N is a good spot NS if the find it|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: only someone who likes moysians would open 1@S ... and I hate them :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 5@D also makes|pg||
nt|mmmakela: S owed the courtesy raise after 2 @S imo|pg||
nt|henryb: I would open 1@s and reach 2@s via Drury|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bobh1: S's 3@d unenterprising|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The someones or the moysians Cornelia?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|chick: the moysians  (and drury)  :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes S was not aggressive enough|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yep|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|phil: I like the spade lead - and preempting their hearts|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I have much the same attitude to Drury as Roland has to the F convention|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|phil: wow, really? I have a partner that feels the same, but I think its key|pg||
nt|chick: Drury is the second worst convention ever invented imho :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|henryb: I think Drury is about third or fourth on my list of the most useful conventions: behind Stayman but ahead of Blackwood|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Yes, I think South would dbl 2@H for takeout|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anne and Sheila are indeed playing again|pg||
nt|greerm: adamson in other room and Hi Liz|pg||
nt|greerm: strong or weak Liz?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: strong|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If there is no rest for the wicked, they play a strong NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Normal looking 3NT|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Old-fashioned Acol, major before minor|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: The weak NT 4-card major style has a lot going for it, but in 4th seat I eould open 1@D tro make it easy for partner to respnd at the 1-level. When I rebid 1NT she can decide ...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: whether to bid on or not|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cuttysark: Over 1@S partner might bid 1NT on quite strong hands and I would be pressured|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|greerm: on the other hand, bidding @D and then @S promises 5+ @D?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Depends on agreement|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well I would not bid spades unless partner did|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I show my hand type|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so  1mi  1@H  ;  1NT   could have four spades the way I play|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cuttysark: Safely into 3NT - now all we have to do is make it|pg||
nt|greerm: we can lots of tricks doub;e dummy|pg||
nt|greerm: I thinl all lines lead to 9+|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Somwhat short of dummy entries|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would not be unreasonable to lead a diamond to the jack at trick 2|pg||
nt|greerm: possibly @D to J at trick 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's what I would do looking at just the N-S hands|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|cuttysark: Worry about club switch - get the thrid heart trick in the bag first|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: but what do I know?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You are not too concerned re club switch with that dummy I think|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cuttysark: If they were 5-3 I am in trouble|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East is much more likely to lead to towards weakness, i.e. spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as she did|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|greerm: Now @SA and clear the @H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, ace is better than the jack|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But she is in fine shape regardless|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Hm|pg||
nt|greerm: but still  in control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what's Hm in this context?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cuttysark: If she loses a heart and 2 clubs she is down|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But West has decided to help out|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d3|pc|hT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The heart continuation by West is difficult to understand. Surely partner has no more hearts when she switched|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|cuttysark: @S2 may tempt her to try another spade finesse...|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: ouch|pg||

mb|p|nt|phil: 6N is lousy on these cards, but it might be made if declarer takes an inspired line|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mariner1: also, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates, Sharon|pg||

nt|mmmakela: 4 hearts very good game|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|chick: by repeated spade finesses?|pg||
nt|henryb: 3N is very pessimistic with N depending on the 2N range.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|phil: for starters, and then squeezing E in the blacks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|phil: but theres some communication issues|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|henryb: repeated spade finesses and a black suit squeeze|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|mariner1: on 15 S was also unaggressive so the contract is also 3@D|pg||
nt|mariner1: that is in Open|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2 ways to guess spades|pg||
nt|henryb: 3N, on the other hand, is not terribly challenging|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mariner1: thanks all! back in 22 minutes or so|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|phil: I think one of the keys is to lead a club to the King - to rectify the count if East wins and 2 tricks if he doesnt|pg||

nt|phil: later|pg||
pc|c7|nt|chick: This is the last hand of this session, stay tuned for the second half in about 10 minutes|pg||
