mb|1H|nt|lestergold: on a bad day 4h goes well off today it makes with an overtrik|pg||
nt|roswolf: WELL IN WE JOLLY WELL GO - MICHAELS STRIKES|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w do not want to sacrificie|pg||

nt|caitlin: Hi Ed:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hello Ed :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so the conventional raise are full in all world |pg||
nt|othered1: Ew may get in here, as west has a normal to double of @S, if that's what double means, not just @H|pg||
nt|caitlin: I assume a X by West would show hearts not takeout|pg||
nt|othered1: That's a bad method|pg||
mb|2S|an|limit+ with !c|mb|d|mb|3C|nt|ahh: 2nt was lebensohl |pg||
nt|bridge_one: playing 5 major it is important to distinguish between 4 and 3 cards raise|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning all and welcome back to Copenhagen|pg||
nt|mollerjep: Goodmorning everybody|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning Nadia and John|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: asking north to bid 3@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 3@H is too high on best defence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But you don't always get that|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Søren Fritzbøger|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: Good morning|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: north not wasting any time|pg||

nt|lestergold: east had better take his violin away quietly|pg||
nt|caitlin: Why a bad method Ed?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: It looks like 3@c was making|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Nu er vi klar|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: Difficult lead?|pg||
nt|lestergold: from AQ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzpf: hi guys|pg||
nt|lestergold: so no bloodshed and therefore no fun for the specs|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Anders|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi anders|pg||
nt|lestergold: i assume west's double was a  support double|pg||
nt|frm: 10 tricks. You will never find the @D-lead!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: agree:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Henrik Røn|pg||
nt|lestergold: 10 trick theft|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: well 9 maybe|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Good morning|pg||
mc|10|nt|roswolf: well it was a noise:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: if so very dangerous on his pile of fester i know players who would have bid 4s as east|pg||
nt|othered1: because, first, since 2@H doesn't deny @H, when you double you better be able to beat them.  so double will be rare.  And how do you safely make a 3-suit takeout?|pg||

nt|mollerjep: never 10...|pg||
nt|lestergold: this may not be flat not if in open south makes a two suited overcall!!|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Ireland made 3NT against NI which is good news for Scotland|pg||
nt|roswolf: north may pass as well as east and then?|pg||
nt|lestergold: south in if he can show the two suiter|pg||
nt|lestergold: ladns on feet with this bid slightly risky at unfavourable|pg||

nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Not Bjarnarson, not me:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the pass by North it is a possible choice|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Only problem would be a bad trump break|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Do you claim copyright, Mike?|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: If they had led & run the knave instead, hmmm|pg||
nt|bridge_one: because vuln|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, i dont have strong feelings. if EW were red, then i think pass is better. in trhe actual conditions i have no strong feelings. for a change :)|pg||
nt|mollerjep: yes, in a few sec..|pg||
mb|3S|an|GF|nt|Walddk2: The N Irish are in 5@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: i amretiring shortly on the royalties|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: all very sane|pg||
nt|lestergold: north maybe pl;ayed with pard before|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is 2NT conventional?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: No alert|pg||
nt|marlowepi: holding that N hand i wouldnt be that worried about 3NT making while there are 4 losers in 4H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you don;t really have a second spade stop and almost all your stuff is outside spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the hearts are weak but you have great chunky stuff where it will do a lot of good|pg||
mb|4D|an|Splint|nt|marlowepi: NS are vul, but also N has all working values & excellent spots, and EW are NV so no riches likely on defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE  LIMERICK ****  N-IRELAND 92, SCOTLAND 91, ENGLAND 79,  CBAI 71, IRELAND 68,  WALES 45  ****|pg||
nt|ahh: 5@D better contract  but perhaps less successful |pg||
nt|idc: a @c was led other room by South, so defence can only take 3 quicjk ones there - 3NT may have been makeable|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: declarer may be forced to duck a @D now|pg||
nt|ahh: @S lead instantly attacks the entry |pg||
nt|roswolf: a slam is possible here in the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North-South wife and husband, Charlotte and Dennis. Liz may remember Charlotte from Venice 1988 when Denmark defeated Great Britain in the Venice Cup Final|pg||
nt|lestergold: good players know that in 4th seat their pards usually bid their hand for them|pg||
nt|lestergold: likely to be a flattie|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I like the bidding|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: if south had not been a passed hand then north would have made at least a try|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: the 2NT bid reaps its very just punishment|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: safe enough contract|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Charlotte and Bettina, the very young Danish pair then|pg||
nt|caitlin: I would X with North hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: it would be pretty unbelieveable if this slam was not reached in a final of this nature|pg||
nt|cuttysark: @CJ is a big card: North worried about what to do with all his losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: he knows that the singleton diamond is enormous bound to find the solution to his losers in dummy one way or the other|pg||
pc|c7|nt|idc: small @d to the knave could be ducked by SOuth of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: yes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I remember it well - we lost by about 5 imps after I played off a game...|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|ahh: nice defence if she does |pg||
nt|Walddk4: South is the president of the Danish Bridge Federation. For many years in the past he formed a very successful partnership with his cousin, Peter Schaltz. Bronze medal at the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Olympics in Seattle among other achievements|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1984 I think it was|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 1984 was Seattle, certainly|pg||
nt|cuttysark: There are times when Deep Thought does not help. This is one|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|nt|ahh: still shouldnt go 4 down so small swing to scots |pg||
nt|idc: not so quickly South... good|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: making 2?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|ahh:  dec will be pleased 3 down is imps in |pg||
pc|s2|nt|idc: after the @c lead to the knave in other room - if East had led dJ, she has an easy duck if South covers|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I suspect they are well out of 6@C here - can be made, but you need to take good views|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Anders Sigsgaard|pg||
nt|asig: Hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi Anders|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: on borderline 4333 hands (Pass or Double) it is not unreasonable to make the decision--if nothing else serves as a decider--based on whether or not your 4-card suit is spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: because that makes 2S more likely to make and more likely to push opps to 3 level|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
mc|12|nt|lestergold: so far the hands have been boring and sane|pg||
nt|lestergold: thinking about the biding another way is that north has made two minimum bids and his partner has made a slam try splinter- he has two bullets and a first round control and a ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: supported second round control- its more than enuf|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: another low level and safe contract|pg||

nt|lestergold: not good enif odds for a grand excellent odds for a small|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: scientific|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and meanwhile NS had a likely 140 in spades, a virtually certain 110|pg||
nt|bridge_one: all finesses are good, so np for N/S|pg||
mb|4H|nt|cuttysark: 2 remarkable bids here: the vulnerable double with the disparate majors, and the 1NT with no spade stopper :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: you should not bid grands that depends on a suit breaking 4/3 or even on a 3/2 break according to the conventional wisdom|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes science doesnt exist in Denmark it seems|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right, easy slam, three finesses, what's the problem ?  :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the lead @C it is the best, but impossible to make after pass at 2@C by East|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however always 12 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: many would scoff, but it is not totally crazy for E to double 2C. even the times NS could in theory make you pay dearly, it will in fact happen only a tiny fraction of the time|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if my other king were in a side suit i would certainly not do it, but with clubs the only suit i want a lead in, i might|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: ah pard opened and Must haveA STOPPER|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Personally, I prefer aces to jacks :)|pg||
nt|frm: Double dummy it´s a make! But in practice???|pg||
nt|lestergold: we are back down to earth on this hand with a thin game which looks precarious but kind spade break and kind placement of Kc declarer may manage the trump suit fo one loser|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuttysark: If he knew for sure that the forcing game was best he would have forced - let us be a little less double dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: nor do I but this was starightforweard the defence was ,logical and clearly working well and thebn west decided to join declarers team for some reason|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: in north comes|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes but holding 4+ spades is best|pg||

nt|idc: If impressed: if I ever learnt any Danish (beyond Skal), I doubt I would ever get as far as the word for "infrangible" in a million years|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, we dont know what their agreements are. perhaps they distinguish between 3 & 4 card support, and 2NT shopws three|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: No 2nt was 3+@s and GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Bif eventually converted me to the idea that 4-4-4-1 is an awful shape for a light opening Stephen|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after pass pass pass 1weakNt np to overcall for west|pg||
nt|lestergold: not double dummy it was mkisere to play a spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: an error possibly due to teh pressure these players are under in  a tough final|pg||
nt|frm: I agree with Mike. It´s not double dummy to figure out, that you have to continue @C|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: Not that bad when the singleton is in diamonds|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well, South has his values in the wrong places opposite a major 2-suiter|pg||
nt|cindy:  not for me thx|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He could also have given partner a diamond ruff instead of playing the forcing game|pg||
pc|c4|nt|idc: I might find A AK too much but you do have a point|pg||
nt|roswolf: i assume the 29 imps lead is a carry-over!?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: We have no comparisons in this segmwnt yet|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be a very good save|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to get a @D ruff in|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a v good save|pg||
nt|roswolf: depends on whether e/w get their diamond ruff|pg||
nt|mariner1: and that disappears with @S lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: great minds rob!:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: with dim ruff thats only 2 off|pg||
nt|mariner1: 10@D dropping is bug too|pg||
nt|mariner1: big|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe bug is right :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont like the 4c bid i feel it implies more defensive strength|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/wshould have bought ghis hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: I don't think NS were ever not bidding 5@C, question is whether EW should bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@S|pg||

pc|h3|nt|vugraphzmq: what will you miss by passing...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably 2S was artificial|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@s was 4@h|pg||
nt|asig: 6@d is makeable but not easy to bid|pg||
nt|cindy:  well  3N would show 4@h also|pg||
nt|asig: Especially after the 1NT opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@c forced 2@d and then 2@s shows 4@h|pg||
nt|cindy:  ok|pg||
nt|cindy:  gotcha|pg||
nt|marlowepi: TYVM Soren|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|frm: But you play a lot of boards, and it´s a tough final. You can´t completely avoid mistakes|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: exactly|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cuttysark: West should know North has a singleton diamond|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that was not optimum|pg||
nt|mariner1: well the @c is now as good as the ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: They try to hide declarers hand|pg||
pc|d4|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzmq: and all the suits breaking badly for the opposition|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So he can pick up South's trump now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|cuttysark: But that does not give him enough tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it is hard to see how the 5th defensive trick arises|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: hej VM|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bridge_one: 9 @C and 2@C, so one is a false discard ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors if i passed the W hand i would not be that eager to overcall. i don't want E to raise, really, and meanwhile N might have a bad 6-count so declarer might go down ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: several in 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S was thinking in 2 seconds before playing @c2|pg||
nt|cindy:  well at least he has the ace|pg||
nt|bridge_one: perhaps was more easy playing @S instead @C for the declarer|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mariner1: S wants them to break @D, does not know it does not matter|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: south can dream on|pg||
nt|asig: Declarer rises with the Ace in order to block the clubs, good play|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: but as commnetators its our job to identify errors as well as to praise excellent plays |pg||
pc|s3|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d9|nt|cuttysark: Must concede a heart now|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But I think he has too much to do|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s6|nt|caitlin: I wouldn't open the West hand and he takes chances with the overcall|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|roswolf: needs the spade finesse|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|bridge_one: 9 in @S by North - nice guess by West|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, i would rather open and get it off my chest than overcall. but pass throughout is fine |pg||
nt|cindy:  looks like he is going minus only 200|pg||
nt|cindy:  100 maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: +110?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South has only 3 @H, so 1 down, not 2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in general i don;t like to open a one-bid on a 5422 10-count when i have 100 honors in a suit other than the one i am bidding :).  in a way i would rather open 1D, but would settle ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for pass|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: these are good players and they expect us to tell it how it is|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am told that GIB says a club lead lets the game through....|pg||
nt|lestergold: is GIB always right?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahh: i agree with all this about 4441 hands i generally feel they play a king below their point count |pg||
nt|lestergold: it does matter south has the losing option not now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: that west has rushed in|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Probably more often than I am, Mike|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: It's always an advantage to open the bidding. Defensive bidding is not as accurate|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one advantage of this NS method is that when N and S each have one (different) 4-card major, the opening leader doesnt know whether declarer has the major that dummy ddoesnt have. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it makes the lead harder (and maybe the later defense) compareed to more standard methods|pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: good method for me, because when i open 1NT i usually want to hide my hand also :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6D a playable spot, though|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Probably by starting with a small heart from south|pg||

nt|lestergold: 2n may war oppos about hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: failing that, S might have tried 3D over 2NT. it is not as if the combined values are so thin that 3NT rates to hinge on the lead|pg||

nt|cindy:  this is one where i would bid 3S   they are never going to stop and double|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the problem it is to give informations at declarer bidding the raise in @S - and with zero can be bad|pg||
nt|caitlin: I like transfer overcalls over strong club and 2@C strong|pg||
nt|lestergold: in spades the only suit west could have opened but wiosely didnt|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North-South obvioulsy of the old school where 11 points did not make an opening bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: north borderline for opening probably didnt like the fact that none of his meagre points were in his long suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And South, 3rd in vulnerable, does not have a god suit to bid|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  At the other table they will open  as they play precision|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or even a good suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think notth's hand is for the above reason a hairs breath short of an opener altho not a hanging offence to open|pg||

nt|idc: great fun man|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So was Victor Goldberg who died recently|pg||
nt|ahh: sadly we also lost Victor Goldberg recently too |pg||
nt|cuttysark: West was playing South for @DA, so I do not fancy his chances of getting it right|pg||
nt|lestergold: flaw?|pg||
nt|mariner1: after opening lead W was marked with @SA,, so J was issue,,,,, @c to dummy|pg||
nt|mariner1: best line|pg||
nt|roswolf: another freakish hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@C nice spot,,,,,,,, 6@S not so much|pg||
nt|lestergold: not right to play club because that would have given up the possibiklity of the club loser eventually going on diamonmds|pg||
nt|mariner1: remember he knew where @SA was|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6c?|pg||
nt|lestergold: nice?|pg||
nt|lestergold: where does the spade loser go?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: well bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: one point less (K in @d instead Q@H&Q@D) and the slam was made|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: lol, but Askgaard doesn't do that:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N to S: You are born lucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: hard to imagine anything but a push on this board|pg||
nt|idc: East has one of my hands, though it's a bit more shapely than I usually get|pg||
nt|ahh: a true yarborough |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: one diamond for discard not enuf!|pg||
nt|mariner1: you play @S to q|pg||
mb|1C|nt|roswolf: hmm slightly suprising line of play|pg||
nt|cuttysark: We have a comparison now - Konow mised the thin 3NT onBoard 1, losing 8 imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: now how will north value this hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I like it - I like aces :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: end up hopefully playing W for Ajx  not easy I admit|pg||
nt|roswolf: how double will give south a problem|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh right only one @D pitch here|pg||
nt|mariner1: so no 6@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: had he opened they would have probably socred a plus |pg||
nt|cuttysark: You are not supposed to quote us :) I shall have to be careful what I say :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|ahh: Roland will give exact odds of 1 |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even better news for Scotland now. NI -5 against Ireland|pg||
nt|roswolf: interesting 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|lestergold: well difficult for n/s now not to over cook the hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: the raise here may be unwise|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6c for sure being bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: south cant know who is making what here|pg||
nt|mariner1: well does S think N bid 5@C to make?|pg||
nt|caitlin: good Namyats hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the problem for North was to guess if AQ@d was 2 tricks or one - after 1@S overcall he choose the chance to find the K in West|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes he should|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: np, they enjoy the comment|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: at this vulnerability he is certainly on a guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would make the samew bis as south|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: ut I would not want to get too high with these breaks!|pg||
nt|lestergold: even tho we can see that double is thewinning bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|frm: A lucky slam in @H or @C is on!|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: A Yarborough is a hand with no card higher than a nine spot. The term is derived from Lord Yarborough of England, who offered a wager with odds of 1,000 pounds to one against the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: chance of any player having such a holding. The actual chance of any player holding a hand with no card higher than a nine has been mathematically equated to 1,827 to 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like @S may be where they end up + west may have a flyinf hack|pg||
nt|lestergold: south delighted with the second bid!!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmmm wet by west|pg||
mb|3D|nt|cuttysark: Worth a thought when there are no overtricks - more tempting if NS were vulnerable|pg||
nt|jbgood: S's response: I find your suit prd|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 6c is two way its inmsurance again st vul opps makingh 5h and its slam if partner is good|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: now @C|pg||
nt|caitlin: I think @H7 signalling for diamond|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East will make the contract only discarding on @D and playing @D from dummy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is a namyats hand in playing strength, yes. the problem with opening 4D is that you need specific stuff in specific places and it will be awkward looking for it at that level, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as there may be no safety at the 5 level. for slam purposes i would rather open 1S. with hearts, though, i would open 4C|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: @cA, @cq and @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: but a club is best|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South is thinking at a hand like  @S@S@S@S@S@S, xxx @D Kx@C inEast|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in this case must play @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: plauing bridge it is very important to guess :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: 4S is a practical bid because NS may have a cheap save. also at these colors 4S cannot be chopped liver so you arent really underbidding by much|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: i f you dont axe with 3 solid trump tricks and pard making a free vul bid - when will you?|pg||

nt|mariner1: http://www.bridge.dk/  - Tournament site|pg||

nt|cuttysark: (The expression is 'bide his time'; the typing is abysmal, sorry :))|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5-3-3-2 is not generally a good shape for sacrificing|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: now no chance|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He had opened - and partner's raise scarecly improves his defensive propsects outside the trump suit :)|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|d2|pg||
nt|roswolf: when the almighty gives you such a hand it is not wise to decline the present|pg||
nt|cuttysark: You sound like Confucius :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I suspect he will go 2 down, and might escape for 1 down after a double....|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmm yes i can - but one of my hobbyhorses is that doubling + redoubling for businees is a dying art|pg||
nt|cuttysark: She?|pg||
nt|roswolf: except qj doubleton in spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: and west is not short of discards|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: are they just thinking soren or is there a break?|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Looks like one of those things: nobody liked his spade holding |pg||

mb|p|nt|ahh: if the event was held elsewhere in Ireland we could do Knock Knock jokes |pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt looming|pg||
nt|lestergold: should beat this|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i think it is easier for east having made a negative double to tell his partner that he has more than a mere 4 card heart support type holding|pg||
nt|frm: Just made!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not much going for this contract|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Provided North leads an unbid suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2h should not be strength showing after the double but maybe in their methods it is|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|henryb: I think E ahould lead the Q -- partner could show the J then|pg||
nt|idc: difficult problem for North first round - I quite like 2@s opposite a five card major|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spec says "S is a state of mind". ouch, guilty as charged|pg||
nt|cindy:  ya know thats funny   in real life i always sit S and never get to play the hands|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: kill point at trick 2|pg||

pc|c5|nt|cuttysark: I think they have guaranteed a heart lead - fortunately the hearts are kind|pg||

pc|d6|nt|lestergold: at end of day north had a minimum opener south had a limit raise and north had a non acceptance|pg||

nt|lestergold: so im not sorry for them|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: ruff two diamonds a play club?|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably as good a line as any from here|pg||

pc|d8|nt|lestergold: wst had better button it up here|pg||
nt|caitlin: interesting splinter with an Ace|pg||

nt|paulhac: Hi Liz|pg||
nt|mariner1: N has to know S is short in @c|pg||

nt|mariner1: you know your hand is worth a K or A more, and you have cards in between you|pg||
nt|mariner1: and S,,,,,, time to raise|pg||
nt|bridge_one: giving the control of 3th round in @C (haveing 4 cards raise)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and hoping the @C arn't 3/0 :)|pg||
nt|othered1: got the idea across, and north seemed to rightly value his red controls.  BW does the rest|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East led away from the @HQ twice|pg||
nt|henryb: its more problematic with a stiff K or Q, which may promote tricks and don't show up in Blackwood|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: 4 of his 5 points not working too hard|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: one normally does not like to have stiff ace for a splinter, but here S esily has splinter values even without that ace|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: Good bidding and a good contract|pg||
nt|othered1: I think this was an excellent auction|pg||

nt|henrik_r:  W could have had @DK8x as they lead 2nd/4th|pg||
nt|lestergold: ebventually declarfer will try heart finesse as he cant set up clubs in time|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Even in partner's suit? |pg||
pc|s7|nt|henryb: a heart switch on which declarer played the 9, and another heart whan in with the @sK. declarer got the second one right|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNNG ****  LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  SCOTLAND 91, N-IRELAND 88, ENGLAND 81, IRELAND  72, CBAI 71, WALES 43 ****|pg||

nt|henrik_r:  Yes|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Also 2nd/4th in partner's suit|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: me neither. the downside is wrong-siding a NT game. the alternative is a negative double--risky, but if it works out you will right-side|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not saying i would double, but it does have a significant upside|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: 2 offski|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East might have inserted @SJ to make things clearer|pg||
nt|lestergold: west in tank|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Indeed. It is not that easy for E to discard a heart as he knows declarer to have @HA|pg||
nt|lestergold: east should know his partner has qs because his partner le a low spade showing an honour if thats how they still play|pg||
nt|lestergold: and cant have ace of hearts must play him for qs|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well they play 2nd/4th, which means low from doubletons, so I don't think it is clear|pg||
nt|lestergold: that Liz is the problem i dont understand their methods|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  They continue to play 2nd/4th throughout so E knows very little about his partner's spades|pg||
nt|frm: But W is probably thinking of who has the J of @S |pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: however on general ground east must play his pard for that qs|pg||
nt|lestergold: and by discarding his heart he has done so|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h5|nt|mollerjep: Diamonds are as good as it gets...|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: assuming a strong NT, it can gain for example when W has 18 with a doubleton S king. despite 27 HCP, probably a double stop will be needed as finesses through S rate to lose|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h9|pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||
pc|d6|nt|frm: Now it´s time for cashing in the defence|pg||

nt|ahh: no chance north plays this 1 |pg||
nt|henryb: its like the newspapers|pg||
nt|mariner1: only part scores here|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very favourable layout and south'shand on thelayout was worth more than his bids had shown in effect|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if playing a weak NT, the case for double is stronger|pg||
nt|henryb: if you are going to cue @s, undoubtedly 4@s would be better than 3, since 3 would, I think, be looking for a stopper for 3N|pg||
nt|lestergold: well defended|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Very unlucky contract - I shall never complain about my luck again|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4 s makes for n/s|pg||
nt|cuttysark: (Not till tomorrow, anyway)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S is complaining:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|ahh: so far as scotland are concerned run of flat games is all they need |pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably S doubled because he thought a 4-4 heart fit might be the best strain. that might be true at the game level, but at the slam level clubs should be better. and S has slam ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: values. that is why I would bid 4S directly over 2S|pg||
mb|2C|nt|paulhac: They will do well to reach 4@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: still risky though, obviously. the sort of call that would become genuinely attractive if a swing were needed|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, 4@s immediatly better that 3@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome Henry|pg||
nt|caitlin: but North could have 4 hearts |pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Henry:)|pg||
nt|othered1: And doyou think 4@S -- using all t hat room, so it should be a very specific hand -- is better than the approach south took?|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, perhaps, but 4@s does not leave very much room for manoeuvre|pg||
nt|henryb: no; with all those high cards it is unlikely that they can preempt high|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Tell him the old school never complains :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: the problem is: 2@C 2@s dbl 4@s ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: bidding is easy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If I open 4@H with that hand, my partner has @SQ, @HK and @DA|pg||
nt|ahh: i like 4@H until p turns up with @H  K and @D AK|pg||
nt|idc: pick the most likely game, bid it, then make it ... next board|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N might have some play from S,,, how to bid that|pg||
nt|mariner1: and N bid NT here 1st anyway|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is E held even the heart TEN he might well just blast 4H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: over 1C|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulhac: Not now:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i do thinkl an immediate 4S is better, because NV  W might raise spades|pg||
nt|dburn:  since all partner can do over it is sign off or bid Blackwood|pg||
nt|othered1: The loss of space would make me think twice before bidding it.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I will|pg||
nt|lestergold: well there is life in this hand yet|pg||
mb|r|nt|lestergold: 2h the normal spot|pg||
nt|dburn:  at any rate, West has a particularly vile problem in this auction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not me. no problem when you are compensating for loss of space by showing a very specific hand, and leaving RKC available|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w close to game in hearts|pg||
nt|frm: Yes that 9 of S! in the east hand is a guarantee for playing the suit correct|pg||
mb|2S|nt|henryb: I suppose it is too much to expect that partner's KQ would be in @d and that she might hold the @hK in addition?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: so there are at least 3 hands to make slam easy |pg||
nt|ahh: Ian find a 4th |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 2@H nice and calm|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: life hasn't taught you to expect disappointment every time?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He will find the grand slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: adn should be held to 2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this will quietly go down two probably|pg||
nt|henryb: 3N unusual or to play?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: not a good contract|pg||
nt|dburn:  he may have hoped that 3NT showed the minors|pg||
nt|mollerjep: Konow and Gjaldbæk playing their last season together after winning several championships.|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac: It needed to be played by West to have any chance|pg||
nt|lestergold: on this lead at any rate|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl by North would work in this hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: no alert|pg||
nt|dburn:  on the grounds that two hands tha could not enter the auction at their first turns could not want to play in 3NT, but...|pg||
nt|lestergold: now n/s have found their fit|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: it seems normal to win and lead D jack|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mollerjep: thats tough...|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N: Maybe I should pass 2@c|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I like to bid majors. So I would not overcall 2@C with that West hand - I would double and convert spades to clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: well hard for east to bid vulnerable with his mpile of fester just as well because if N/S were to be pushed they make 4s on the lucky layout|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Gotta find the heart fit, no atter how high the level :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|othered1: Except in the post-mortem, what makes you think that you're showing a specific hand?  and what are the specifics?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|idc: right - I can't try for 6 or I'll be in 7 -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: if they dont fin d te ruff its an overtrick of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm|pg||
nt|lestergold: overtrick now unless east finds a gtrump|pg||
nt|lestergold: west should have overtaken what to gain he knows the position|pg||
pc|d9|nt|henryb: may have thought it was simply bridge logic!|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: is he hoping that east has Jxx of hearts and that there are three natural trump tricks?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|frm: What does W´s RD show? Good cards? Then perhaps he shouild have introduced his @H-suit instead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And I will take my diamond ruff against 4@S|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that heart jack falsecard might work if E cannot count to thirteen|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dburn:  ...that was not clear to East, and I confess it would not be clear to me either|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: partner cannever be in to give hinm that dim ruff so trumps drawn dim loser away on heart and 4 made on the cross ruff|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c4|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bridge_one: however North can't dbl because south could have zero|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh they done a clever thing|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: only explanation |pg||
nt|marlowepi: W is not going to play E for 8 hearts, after all...|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: sorry missed it|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|othered1: I still like south's getting @H into the auction early, which made north's later decision trivial.  |pg||
nt|dburn:  North can't double because West will run, and he can't necessarily handle 4@d|pg||
mc|9|nt|cuttysark: I win th club lead and switch to may diamond. Win first spade, give partner club ruff, ruff diamond. Very clever|pg||

nt|lestergold: eaast happy to accept tho|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, South is  minimum and aceless, so will turn down all tries|pg||

nt|bridge_one: great hand for East after long in @d at opps - he know the p must be short|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, there is no arguing that 4S should show spades in this sequence...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Yes, a great hand for her|pg||
nt|lestergold: now how does north show his hand|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  I have no idea :-(|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac: But surely West will lead a heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: both ace clubs wrong and qd and its still infrangible|pg||
nt|lestergold: if its with 4c they will still be able to play in 4n or 5c|pg||
mb|3C|an| |nt|lestergold: but north has a monster opposite an opener|pg||
nt|cindy:  hahaha|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3c obviously strong in their methods|pg||
nt|lestergold: presumably transfer to show weak minor|pg||
nt|lestergold: south rejkects and will north try again|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|an| |nt|idc: hmm, and West can duck the @sQ anyway, so maybe nothing makes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Best to lead a heart against 2NT so opponents realise they may have missed a game :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: so likely to be bid in both rooms for a push|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is surely an easy slam to bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: they perhaps play 2Nt Gf |pg||
nt|bridge_one: and 3@c inviting|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, the interference is helping the side with the cards, as so often happens. still, it is not like N can pass....|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: No, invit+|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: much too easy for roland|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|dburn:  actually, you could play pass to show hearts and 4@h to show spades, if you were worried about a diamond lead through partner's hand|pg||
nt|othered1: West couldn't work out how to intelligently decide on 7 and did the practical thing|pg||
nt|dburn:  but that may be carrying a sound principle too far|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: W: Maybe I am to good|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree totally david, but if 4S is in the menu it is gonna have to show spades|pg||
nt|bridge_one: invit + is better for West - easy call slam |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3d anyone?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i hope its not encouraging whatevefr it means|pg||
mb|6C|nt|Walddk2: 3@C Puppet   3@D at least one 4-card major   3@H = spades|pg||
nt|idc: no, in that case you can use North to reach the dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac: Its not a gtreat game but vulnerable with 25 points many pairs would have reached it. Even on the heart lead it needs the A@D right|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: well|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Ask Boesgaard - he invented the method|pg||
nt|lestergold: it obviously encouraged north|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And North can't remember enough of it - oh dear|pg||
nt|lestergold: east on lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: which bullet will he fire first|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S is thinking|pg||
nt|lestergold: i love being on lead against a slam with a few aces|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u it usually means opps are void in one of them|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And you lead the wrong one, establishign enough discards for all the losers :)|pg||
mb|6N|nt|henryb: 6N is actually easy. say a minor suot lead. you win, cash the @dKJ and lead the @sQ|pg||

mb|p|nt|idc: I've left it till last, but 6@d is ok too but hard to see them getting to that|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Now he can safely double|pg||

nt|lestergold: no difference|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: 3@d is no. S: Mayde N does not remember.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this will cut their lead dwon by the odd 12/13 imps|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Usual problem with complicated methods over 1NT - they do not arise often enough to stick in the mind|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N: NT gives more point|pg||

pc|sT|nt|ahh: how right that advice often turns out |pg||

nt|Walddk2: You can't be serious, Stephen|pg||
nt|ahh: another 4-1 @S break |pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: mildly|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West carefully holds declarer to 11 tricks - hard not to feel bad about that|pg||
nt|roswolf: big fits where will the music stop?|pg||
nt|roswolf: straightforward hand here|pg||
nt|lestergold: not quite a game here for e/w|pg||
nt|dburn:  but even then, you can pitch two clubs on the top hearts and hope to play a complete cross-ruff for thirteen tricks|pg||
nt|dburn:  during which, if @hQ or @cK puts in an early appearance, so much the better|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean wheeling out blackwood|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  RÃ¸n-Zeeberg seem to be having a great set in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: score has just gone up i see for the leaders|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They just made 4@H on board 6 where our NS were allowed to play 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You really want to play the hand out in the hope that one defender revokes when you know you are 1 down?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5@D looks good|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: It was good then..|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or if you discover it hidden in your own hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|henryb: we had one earlier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That would not be bridge they way I know it|pg||
nt|ahh: we also had 13 penalty cards on friday |pg||
nt|ahh: leading just :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: just a thought - not a suggestion|pg||
nt|henryb: the operator had a problem because BBO would not permit a revoke|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 2@C must include a weak 2@D option|pg||
nt|paulhac: North south can make 5@D and it may be difficult for East/Wesr to realise they need to save|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s will be bid and off is my prediciton|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i might take a small piece of that|pg||
nt|lestergold: north only needs to lead Ac and see partners doubleton showing card|pg||
nt|roswolf: north may bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H lead might confuse things|pg||
nt|lestergold: its only a small non vulnerable piece |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: No, It did not show any strength range. Just not a 2suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: maybe 5@HX ?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a lot to think about|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: very much so:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht lead wrong when  you have an ak that partner is never going to expect if you dont lead it|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c cash is the play though...... to see dummy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D is sufficient - if East hold control in @C he would bid over 5@s, otherwise would bid 5@s, after 6@S by West and finish the bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: well that was a bidding error by Konow here was our consensus|pg||
nt|lestergold: a sin by ommision|pg||
mb|2H|an|18-19|nt|idc: agree, 2@d looks better|pg||
nt|cuttysark: -300 is not a big deal against -400|pg||
nt|paulhac: Rather too strong for a weak 2@D in my book|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Of course the defenders may not find their spade ruff...|pg||
nt|roswolf: AGREE|pg||
nt|henryb: or when they do not lead a trump and you find partner with 4(+) @d|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, you are going on to 6S whatever E does, so i think W should just jump straight to 6D over 4S, to let E know immediate;ly how close to a grand they are|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: full of all the coffeehousing tricks known to man |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not mine either but when she does, South has no problem|pg||

mb|3H|an|4!s and 5!h|nt|lestergold: no error here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: What is this 3@C all about?|pg||
nt|ahh: forcing |pg||
nt|ahh: in this tournament @S break badly i am not bidding them |pg||
nt|idc: to find a 4-4 @s fit, but then I'll bet she worried that 3@s wouldn't be forcing (it should be) |pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: i have a 4c major and a @C stop and a good hand|pg||
nt|idc: 3@s after the 3@c 3@d continuation I mean|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Nort has worked out what partner has - and now very difficult to save|pg||
nt|paulhac: Cannot critice East's X|pg||
nt|roswolf: that double will cost|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well, the 4@H maybe suggests a lack of defence there, and what else do you have?|pg||
nt|roswolf: west mightsave the day|pg||
nt|paulhac: If West knew that south had opened a weak 2@D hhe would not have bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: to see partners card|pg||
nt|lestergold: no doubt uidca|pg||
nt|dburn:  it wasn't easy, though. There are matches where you'd win 13 IMPs just for being in six, though obviously this high-class affair is not one of them.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after all, the 4S call gives W about a one-loser hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: W and S is discussing board 10|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n|pg||
nt|frm: Only 11 tricks|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I guess this is one of those Mult 2@C|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well done|pg||

nt|paulhac: That will be 2 on the trot will N/S be reeling?|pg||
nt|cindy:  would you dbl second time with E hand or 3N ?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt is 16+ bal ? |pg||
nt|marlowepi: and i don;t think it is clear at all that E would bid 6C over 5D every time he has club king. what if his spades are ATxxxx and he has no shape? and maybe E thinks the point of 5D ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: was especially to fetch a much more convenient HEART cuebid?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ok, seen - 15/17|pg||
nt|othered1: brb|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Better than the one onthe last board :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: either club finesse or heart break but it wont fight today|pg||

pc|dK|nt|cindy:  should guess it|pg||
nt|cindy:  now she knows N has diamond ace should be easy to guess   and also S might have led a heart with Qx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also prefer 3H to 2H by N on first round, by a lot|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: slam doomed. if W opens a strong NT at other table, the final contract might well be 6C making|pg||

mb|1H|nt|mariner1: 4@S EW?|pg||
nt|lestergold: interesting hand e/w hav e plenty of long suits but its the4/4 spade fit that is i think their best spot for a game |pg||
nt|roswolf: relatively difficult for e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: not easy |pg||
nt|lestergold: the bidding could go pear shaped here very easily|pg||
nt|mafia13: Well, we are still waiting for those really big boards...|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w 4h straightforward hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cuttysark: Would you nt overcall as North?|pg||
mb|2S|an|3!h, invit+|nt|mariner1: E bidding a @S here works|pg||
nt|marlowepi: strongly disapprove of the opening lead. the auction makes it clear N has at least nine cards in the majors, and S does not have three entries. just lead a heart and hope.|pg||
nt|cindy:  do you think S more likely to lead a heart if N had bid 3H ?|pg||
nt|mafia13: Schou is still picking up imps along the way though...|pg||
nt|lestergold: needs club behaviour but they behave|pg||
nt|lestergold: u mean comic nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: especially if east bids 2@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: not at this vulnerability|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|idc: In other room, Scotland look to be beating 4@s - three rounds of @d to start|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S now?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no, not this particular S. if he didnt lead a heart on this auction from this hand, probably he wouldnt lead one on any auctioin|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S said "sorry pd"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3NT a rather lucky make here|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  3NT show a hand that would like to preempt, but has a good suit and perhaps a little extra and thus is afraid to bypass 3NT|pg||
mb|3H|nt|cindy:  appropriate|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S: Semigood preemt|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Wise decision by South not to bid 4@S as it would have been quite expensive this time|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I mean 'not' (Must hit keys harder :))|pg||
nt|frm: I would not introduce my @S-suit with that lousy North-hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Wow - I always bid spades, whenever I have them. What else are they for?|pg||
nt|lestergold: at this vulnerability it is not only dangerous it misleads partner|pg||
nt|lestergold: weak jump overcall possible but with the spade pips so bad that is dangerous at imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: depends on how dangerously u want to live|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@S is cool|pg||
nt|lestergold: east should bid his 4 card major at first opportunity|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mariner1: and they found it|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps a 4@D splinter was not out of placew|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulhac: Interesting X|pg||
nt|cuttysark: South is checking the deck - a lot of good hands about|pg||
nt|cuttysark: A moment for discipline - forget the missed games|pg||
nt|paulhac: Will he be content with 3NT after the last 2 boards|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, it takes a big man to apologize. or maybe just a really bad lead LOL|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well he was prerpared to risk a reverse but on a ten count with a possible misfit it clould have been dangerous|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S and W was surprised that N had 7|pg||
nt|frm: You can take the risk and bid 2 @S (and later on you can take the blame, if it´s wrong)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahh: ROI still +4 v NI   so scotland just leading and no more |pg||
nt|roswolf: but 4nt is interesting|pg||
nt|cindy:  do you think acknowledging a mistake at the table helps the opponents at all ?|pg||
nt|henryb: 1@sX sort of gruesome, as is anything else|pg||
nt|lestergold: north found best lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade lead and west would have an overtrick|pg||
nt|lestergold: should play club finesse and play to ruff a club high in dummy before drawing trumps tro allow for 4/2 break|pg||
nt|cuttysark: After bidding spades it is not tempting to lead them - another reason for bidding?|pg||
nt|lestergold: doesnt mater here as they are 3/3|pg||
nt|lestergold: but thats how i expect declarer will paly it|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: but land on feet|pg||
nt|roswolf: absolutely|pg||
nt|mariner1: some times you have to stick your neck out|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: up with that pesky ace and play trump lose a club and one or two spades|pg||
nt|mariner1: win and run the J@S best here|pg||
nt|cindy:  i know the opps can feed off of a heated discussion at the table|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it does a bit, perhaps, but it does a lot more good for partner than it does for the opps|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|idc: South had overcalled @d in other room, this is a tougher lead for North here|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep|pg||
nt|cindy:  thats a good point|pg||
pc|dT|nt|henryb: 5@c is a MUCH better contract, and I think W should raise clubs over 3@s: partner must have only 2|pg||
nt|ahh: up to 3 imps is a draw |pg||
nt|roswolf: double from someone?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure why E ran before getting doubled in 1NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now means 3/3 red|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahh: so it cant really be any closer |pg||
pc|d6|nt|paulhac: Out of the frying pan.....|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This will definitely be a minus score|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They have very few thus far...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ideal is for N to head S apology off at the pass by saying the likes of "I would have made the same lead, pd"|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|paulhac: When North passed 2@D south should have backed off|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i do not understand the logic of souths bidding - opposite 2 aces and the club queem he thinks slam is cold - wierd|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cuttysark: North's hearts will be hard to promote|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|cindy:  ahh|pg||
nt|cindy:  and then giving him hell later ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and then of course N is free to continue the sentence in his own head: "...if i had your brain, that is"|pg||
nt|cindy:  lolol|pg||
nt|bridge_one: nice bid by East - immediatly 2@c don't work|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|bridge_one: rbl and after 2@c give the information to have 4 cards in other suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh now he doesnt need tghe ruff|pg||

nt|mariner1: @H to A and another @S|pg||

nt|lestergold: sorry minus a club|pg||
nt|marlowepi: before the auction i was wondering if NS would get to game, and instead EW did :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cuttysark: Looks like a nice hand - but if North habitually opens this tripe you have to be careful|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 making|pg||

nt|ahh: i think i am right if both teams finish level then NI win on the tie break|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: ? not a good view|pg||
nt|lestergold: decided to pin notional 9 spades in south hjand|pg||

nt|lestergold: spade was a guess not a bad play|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: why ask for a club back?|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|cuttysark: In case of the 4-1 break he is belatedly worrying about|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he must have had the passing thought that the ten of clubs was singleton playing north for 5 clubs along with the long spades- i suppose not impossible but i agree otherwise ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: play doesnt make sense|pg||
nt|frm: Now he must play for the @H 3-2|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: correct and not easy at that|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: ten tricks making hwere|pg||
nt|dburn:  the grand slam was missed at the other table also on board 10, but 11 and 12 are not great for Koch-Palmund, and time is running out|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: 4@h cannot be made against best defence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: THis will seal it for Scotland I think|pg||
nt|ahh: bit of daylight and bluebells for the lassies now |pg||
nt|cindy:  is it automatic to give up on slam with E hand ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I think it is close, but E didn't thnik long|pg||
nt|dburn:  incidentally, I am a bit confused - did Dennis Koch change his name when he married Charlotte Palmund?|pg||
nt|frm: N might have a pretty good feeling of being in front, so why risk the money with such a very risky D (probably showing the majors)us|pg||
nt|frm: Or a 3-suiter|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West's double showing values - but he should really have a raise to 2NT, not a hand that would pass 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: D was a 3-suiter|pg||
pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: well, if you have methods to show various kinds of big raises and W uses this one, maybe|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: not that any more hsould have been bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess this auction will lead to some discussion|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: well a @S from Q10x is risky here|pg||
nt|lestergold: obviously thinks north may hacve hearst to ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|roswolf: well pard rates some of the time to have an honour|pg||
nt|lestergold: north greatful for the tempo doesnt want to be tapped with hearts|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Yes, their name are Koch-Palmund|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a switch in @h by N/S beat 3Nt|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It is temting to bid, if only to stop partner leading a club against 1NT|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  It is because you called him "old school" earlier|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I do not think the old school would bid, do you?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|lestergold: i meant to say dims|pg||
nt|lestergold: in dummy|pg||
nt|mariner1: and decides to tap himself|pg||
nt|lestergold: very odd whats wrong with establishing clubs|pg||
nt|cindy:  bad spades & bad shape outweigh the two aces i guess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but with 9 losers and terrible trumps, i think dioscretion is the better part of vlaor|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahh: in 13 boards so far this set only  21 imps turned over  amazingly good stuff |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|nt|lestergold: that is not a play i can understand|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzpf: 10 imp to Konow|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Board 11 it is|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W was lucky in spades there. perhaps he should bid something else over 3C hoping he can wheedle a 3NT bid out of E with a semi-stop|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ahh: considering the pressure |pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|bridge_one: in board 11 east in open room after 1@S  2@C , 2Nt  choose to bid 3Nt instead 3@c |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S will not duck twice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he cant bid 3S over 3C, because then too easy to miss cold 3NT when E has no semi-stop|pg||
nt|mafia13: yes!|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  NIelsen has never been old school|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Please tell him I apologise :)|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  He is the oldest junior (about 50) in Denmark|pg||
nt|frm: "About 50"! He will be very pleased to hear that:-)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|lestergold: decided to elope with hearts and forget about the clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: but that isnt enuf tricks for 2s cant be the correct line|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: a useful rule of thumb when you have a close decision is: if at least 1/3 of your Losing Trick Count is in your trump suit, don;t get too excited|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good switch|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  4@S is laydown, but it requires an aggressive view by either player to get there|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: i think he had a clear cut hand to bid slam and should have tried 5BT = pick a slam - a hand for a bidding challenge?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: oh hes established a heart but with no guaranteed entry to dummy he doesnt know the club layuout|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is a bit of a pigs ear the card play here i dont follow its logic|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 3@c was alerted and passed|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cuttysark: Konow fighting back on Borad 9: Multi 2@D conned West into 3NT which played like a dog, -5!|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  And Konow still has the 13 IMP from 6NT minus one to come|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It just arrived, so the match is much closer|pg||
nt|frm: Now it´s becoming interesting. Ruff, @D to the 10 and play @S (and @H 9). Probably making 10 tricks!|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5NT|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|henrik_r:  I think south is more to blame than North|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 4S might easily fail, but N has to bid 5D|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Interesting...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not a pretty sight|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N did not finesse in @d|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: and 3d looks the limit|pg||

mb|3C|mb|3D|nt|idc: I wished on Friday that EW here would play transfer bids after 1M Dbl, but they haven't changed yet|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I would bid out my shape - diamonds then spades twice. Partner might have very little in hearts...|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think leaping michaels should apply in this situation where 4@D would show a spade /diamond 2 suiter|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, weak 2s on 7-card suits make me ill, though many top players would disagree|pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that might push EW higher, and in any case against 4S N might have to decide whether or not to underlead diamonds at trick 3|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This may make it tough for NS to bid their spade game|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: no double fit now..|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  2@S is a serious underbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac: With so many high cards there is also a case for South to cue|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would bid 4H even if barred|pg||
mb|4C|nt|cuttysark: Also a possibility eoffrey, but I prefer to have good suits for Leaping Michaels|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: or 5 if these players also can not cash all their tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: north never having a chance to enter the auction ot that he would have wanted to if he could see his partners near yarborough|pg||
nt|cindy:  i think i would just let myself be fixed on this one since im white|pg||
nt|jbgood: and nobody was fit to double|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S: Sry pd.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: @C lead is the best, but impossible to find|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W isnt far from bidding 5S after E invites it via P|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes the diamond's are not impressive in the quality dept|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, force N to use dummy entry before news of trump break|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: well, i would bid because i am not yellow :)|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: yes, but it could also result in 3CX making|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not if you have the agreement that 3@C dbl means A in @C and raise in @d|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, well that is a different sort of statement. i kind of doubt NS have that agreement, but it has merit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however it is filosophie, bec West could have sgl in @h :)|pg||

pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: E needs the nine of spades. dummy's nine may let declarer make|pg||

nt|bridge_one: to make the squeeze @C/@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: declarer can make now i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after D finesse, draw trumps and exit spade to rectify count. W cannot lead a club & E is squeezed|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: West has @h K|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think no, bec must play @D from dummy one time, and after need 2 entry to ruff a @h, so i think impossible to make ... but i can be in error|pg||
nt|mollerjep: no harm done really...but still an odd pass|pg||

nt|marlowepi: yes that is also true when you open 1NT in first chair, when you know nothing about the hand. here you know RHO is weak|pg||
nt|cindy:  you KNOW i tend to bid too much   |pg||
nt|cindy:  they did in fact double 4H at the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S is thinking|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Askgaard havde super max. for 1@D (11-15), men den lovede ikke ruder|pg||

nt|mariner1: btw we have 12 rooms up now and plenty more coming this weekend, Roland|pg||

nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this also looks straightforward|pg||
nt|mariner1: next session here is in 84 minutes|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s 3n no probs|pg||
nt|roswolf: just a question of overtricks in 3nt|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: ten easy 11 needs help from defence|pg||
nt|mariner1:  Iceland, Australia, Germany, Turkey, Denmark, and Serbia all on the schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: this weekend|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S: I didn't bid 4@h, thas was good|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 31 and 32 first before comparisons from the closed room when we roll over to board 17|pg||
nt|ahh: sure |pg||
nt|ahh: hi all |pg||
nt|cindy:  hmm|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North would make only with a big mistake by East - if East play A in @H after he win the first @H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6NT best|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 162-104|pg||
nt|robinswr: when i won the queen of clubs, he could have ruffed a heart and then put west in with a spade who would have to lead a spade or a diamond|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bridge_one: hover ruffing a @H, playing @s, North would make the contract, bec leave the K in @H at West, so can entry in the dummy ruffing  a @s |pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Jim Hay|pg||
nt|idc: This might be a quiet game, or just possibly a more exciting slam hand|pg||
nt|ahh: not sure by the end i will have any fingernails left |pg||
mb|3D|an|6!d and 3!s|nt|idc: My sympathies are with the non-playing captains|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I'd adise them to hit the bar now - one of them will find it helps to get a start|pg||
nt|paulhac: I like Wests action|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Doesn't do to be overawed just because 1NT calls itself 'strong'|pg||
nt|roswolf: will north double to show the suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why was that good? cold on normal S king lead|pg||
nt|cindy:  4S for me now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|cuttysark: Redbl presumably suggests playing in the other suit, assuming it is not clubs|pg||
nt|paulhac: I wonder if they have discussed the follow up sequences after a xx|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has done enough?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Now it is E/W|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not too difficult to get the heart ruff that beast this|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cuttysark: Thye lead low from doubletons|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cindy:  now, how to make it|pg||
nt|asig: Not the dummy Christiansen was dreaming about|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE  LIMERICK ****  N-IRELAND 93, SCOTLAND 91, ENGLAND 78,  CBAI 71, IRELAND 67,  WALES 46  ****|pg||
pc|h2|nt|paulhac: Surprised East passed|pg||

nt|asig: :)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: NS have actually gainsed on the board where the defended 5@H undoubled: 3 imps when 6@D was also -1|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|idc: Not that 6@s is a very good contract but w/o a @d lead I expect 12 tricks are there|pg||
nt|ahh: @D lead certainly sinks it  but how to play on a non @D lead ?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: good bid, good slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 5nt = no Q|pg||
nt|mollerjep: You can tell that Auken and Christiansen is in the next room....They are 3 boards behind....|pg||
nt|mafia13: lol|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This shoulod make now the diamonds position has been clarified|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East thinking it might be a singleton|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|d5|pc|h7|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|idc: draw trumps, lead a @c up maybe - you may need the @h finesse as well |pg||
nt|mafia13: Well, Konow is normally taking his time as well|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Martin's hand is dificult to handle|pg||

mb|2D|nt|mollerjep: Of course they are keen and skilled, but Auken and Christiansen are also plain slowly and its not my cup of tea...maybe its because I have fallen to sleep to many times :-(|pg||

nt|mollerjep: You have been terrific Søren, thank you...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@h in S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: A misunderstanding|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 6 imps to Konow here - perhaps South has too much defence for the pre-emptive jump|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: Virtually impossible to investigate with any certainty|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H is a practical bid|pg||
nt|ahh: if you need a perfect fit to make assume it will not be there and stay low |pg||
pc|s3|nt|mariner1: next session in 75 minutes|pg||
nt|lestergold: and most if not all roads to 11 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade lead 11 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|nt|idc: When there is a danger of getting to 5 level down one, I think that's right|pg||
nt|cuttysark: As North does for his pre-emptive opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: spades mullered |pg||
nt|lestergold: ten of cxlubs dropping on round two of the suit guaranteeding 3 club tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: so prediction a push|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridge.dk/  - Tournament site|pg||

nt|marlowepi: now he will make|pg||
