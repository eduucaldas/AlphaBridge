nt|Walddk2: Is he playing with you?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then he needs it|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: thanks Jim - and also to you |pg||
nt|ahh: since i am playing with him |pg||
nt|idc: ROI sacrificed in 5@c last hand - 800 and probably a few IMPs to Northern Ireland|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Hi guys|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Mike from Uk here|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi geoffrey|pg||
nt|lestergold: who knows about biding systemsn in use here |pg||
nt|roswolf: not me:(|pg||
nt|lestergold: ur the second weakest link then|pg||
nt|roswolf: there is a website but i dont have the details|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4h no prob for N/S|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s hand i think 4@H?|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4@S here with bad split|pg||
nt|caitlin: unlikely to be bid|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody!|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|idc: But we won't know for sure until the very end when Jim has no fingernails left|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Majors|pg||
nt|ahh: this is a great hand should be throw in but no    every player has a bid |pg||
mb|2H|an|3!s, invit|nt|lestergold: on a bad day 4h goes well off today it makes with an overtrik|pg||
nt|roswolf: WELL IN WE JOLLY WELL GO - MICHAELS STRIKES|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w do not want to sacrificie|pg||
nt|lestergold: the cards all sworking like a dream for N/S|pg||
nt|roswolf: certainly not on this layout|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s x 800 today|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Ed:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hello Ed :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so the conventional raise are full in all world |pg||
nt|othered1: Ew may get in here, as west has a normal to double of @S, if that's what double means, not just @H|pg||
nt|caitlin: I assume a X by West would show hearts not takeout|pg||
nt|othered1: That's a bad method|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ahh: 2nt was lebensohl |pg||
nt|bridge_one: playing 5 major it is important to distinguish between 4 and 3 cards raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: asking north to bid 3@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 3@H is too high on best defence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But you don't always get that|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: north not wasting any time|pg||
nt|roswolf: shortish and sweet|pg||
nt|lestergold: east had better take his violin away quietly|pg||
nt|caitlin: Why a bad method Ed?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|idc: It looks like 3@c was making|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Nu er vi klar|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: hi guys|pg||
nt|lestergold: so no bloodshed and therefore no fun for the specs|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Anders|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi anders|pg||
nt|lestergold: i assume west's double was a  support double|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: well it was a noise:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: if so very dangerous on his pile of fester i know players who would have bid 4s as east|pg||
nt|othered1: because, first, since 2@H doesn't deny @H, when you double you better be able to beat them.  so double will be rare.  And how do you safely make a 3-suit takeout?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: Can afford to cash @DQ, then the spade switch must come|pg||
nt|idc: I suspect the defence need a spade ruff soon to beat it|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes very unlikely|pg||
nt|bridge_one: sry, 9 |pg||
nt|marlowepi: who doubles 1C with N hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: part scores only here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: faitly even split of assets|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahh: i dont include 3nt as reasonable |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ireland made 3NT against NI which is good news for Scotland|pg||
nt|roswolf: north may pass as well as east and then?|pg||
nt|lestergold: south in if he can show the two suiter|pg||
nt|lestergold: ladns on feet with this bid slightly risky at unfavourable|pg||
nt|roswolf: north better not be too aggressive|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Marshall Lewis|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Not Bjarnarson, not me:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the pass by North it is a possible choice|pg||
pc|c6|nt|idc: If they had led & run the knave instead, hmmm|pg||
nt|bridge_one: because vuln|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, i dont have strong feelings. if EW were red, then i think pass is better. in trhe actual conditions i have no strong feelings. for a change :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: The N Irish are in 5@D|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: all very sane|pg||
nt|lestergold: north maybe pl;ayed with pard before|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is 2NT conventional?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: No alert|pg||
nt|marlowepi: holding that N hand i wouldnt be that worried about 3NT making while there are 4 losers in 4H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you don;t really have a second spade stop and almost all your stuff is outside spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the hearts are weak but you have great chunky stuff where it will do a lot of good|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS are vul, but also N has all working values & excellent spots, and EW are NV so no riches likely on defense|pg||
pc|hA|nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE  LIMERICK ****  N-IRELAND 92, SCOTLAND 91, ENGLAND 79,  CBAI 71, IRELAND 68,  WALES 45  ****|pg||
nt|ahh: 5@D better contract  but perhaps less successful |pg||
nt|idc: a @c was led other room by South, so defence can only take 3 quicjk ones there - 3NT may have been makeable|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: declarer may be forced to duck a @D now|pg||
nt|ahh: @S lead instantly attacks the entry |pg||
nt|roswolf: a slam is possible here in the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North-South wife and husband, Charlotte and Dennis. Liz may remember Charlotte from Venice 1988 when Denmark defeated Great Britain in the Venice Cup Final|pg||
nt|lestergold: good players know that in 4th seat their pards usually bid their hand for them|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|lestergold: if south had not been a passed hand then north would have made at least a try|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the 2NT bid reaps its very just punishment|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: safe enough contract|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Charlotte and Bettina, the very young Danish pair then|pg||
nt|caitlin: I would X with North hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|idc: small @d to the knave could be ducked by SOuth of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: yes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I remember it well - we lost by about 5 imps after I played off a game...|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahh: nice defence if she does |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|ahh: still shouldnt go 4 down so small swing to scots |pg||
nt|idc: not so quickly South... good|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well done|pg||
nt|idc: well done|pg||
nt|ahh: excellent play by dec and south |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzpf: making 2?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|nt|ahh:  dec will be pleased 3 down is imps in |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|idc: after the @c lead to the knave in other room - if East had led dJ, she has an easy duck if South covers|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I suspect they are well out of 6@C here - can be made, but you need to take good views|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Anders Sigsgaard|pg||
nt|asig: Hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi Anders|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s6|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on borderline 4333 hands (Pass or Double) it is not unreasonable to make the decision--if nothing else serves as a decider--based on whether or not your 4-card suit is spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: because that makes 2S more likely to make and more likely to push opps to 3 level|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: so far the hands have been boring and sane|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk4: and welcome to Cindy Marshall|pg||
nt|cindy:  hi all|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|idc: so South must duck and then declarer has a tough choice - running knave and perhaps losing 4 quick clubs is silly if @d were 2-2 all along|pg||
nt|caitlin: makes excellent sense to me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: OK caitlin you've convinced me :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: lol:)|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: scientific|pg||

nt|bridge_one: all finesses are good, so np for N/S|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cuttysark: 2 remarkable bids here: the vulnerable double with the disparate majors, and the 1NT with no spade stopper :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: you should not bid grands that depends on a suit breaking 4/3 or even on a 3/2 break according to the conventional wisdom|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes science doesnt exist in Denmark it seems|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right, easy slam, three finesses, what's the problem ?  :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the lead @C it is the best, but impossible to make after pass at 2@C by East|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however always 12 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: many would scoff, but it is not totally crazy for E to double 2C. even the times NS could in theory make you pay dearly, it will in fact happen only a tiny fraction of the time|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if my other king were in a side suit i would certainly not do it, but with clubs the only suit i want a lead in, i might|pg||

nt|idc: The Northern Ireland score has dropped to 8 IMPs now, so Scotland's turn to be 2 VPs ahead|pg||
nt|ahh: how many play 2@C as natural over 1@C that is or can be short ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: only when it can be as short as 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a hand where you wish you have the hand record, because 3NT is infrangible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S|pg||
nt|roswolf: more chance of action here|pg||
nt|roswolf: i suppose 4@H may be bid depending on the impetus of the auction|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Interesting- Ns can make a few hearts, EW a few diamonds. Not many :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: give or take 50% for Roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: Ron please jkeep your decimal points to yopurself|pg||
nt|lestergold: too much hard maths|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: This time 2nt was a spadefit:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: in north comes|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes but holding 4+ spades is best|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: he would play 6s and only lose one trump|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW can probable handle a major game here.....|pg||
nt|cindy:  sometimes you have to do it with three|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, i didnt mean my remark as critical this time, only joking|pg||
mb|1N|an|12-14|mb|2S|an|!s and one minor|nt|cuttysark: I doubt they wil get as high as game|pg||

nt|lestergold: playinmg small to k dropping stiff q offside and then leading up to J9|pg||
nt|mariner1: probably|pg||
nt|roswolf: south bids a straight 3@C - i might have tried a tactical effort 2nt!?|pg||
nt|lestergold: however back at the ranch it looks like 11 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|cindy:  see   why not just open 1S |pg||
nt|cindy:  far less dangerous than overcalling|pg||
mb|p|nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  SCOTLAND 92, N-IRELAND 90, ENGLAND 79, CBAI 70, IRELAND 70, WALES 45 ****|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmq: who votes for not opening the E hand|pg||
nt|idc: If impressed: if I ever learnt any Danish (beyond Skal), I doubt I would ever get as far as the word for "infrangible" in a million years|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, we dont know what their agreements are. perhaps they distinguish between 3 & 4 card support, and 2NT shopws three|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  ok  3N  next|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: No 2nt was 3+@s and GF|pg||
pc|h4|nt|idc: Bif eventually converted me to the idea that 4-4-4-1 is an awful shape for a light opening Stephen|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after pass pass pass 1weakNt np to overcall for west|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: Not that bad when the singleton is in diamonds|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well, South has his values in the wrong places opposite a major 2-suiter|pg||
nt|cindy:  not for me thx|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|idc: I might find A AK too much but you do have a point|pg||
nt|roswolf: i assume the 29 imps lead is a carry-over!?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: We have no comparisons in this segmwnt yet|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be a very good save|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to get a @D ruff in|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a v good save|pg||
nt|roswolf: depends on whether e/w get their diamond ruff|pg||
nt|mariner1: and that disappears with @S lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: great minds rob!:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: with dim ruff thats only 2 off|pg||
nt|mariner1: 10@D dropping is bug too|pg||
nt|mariner1: big|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe bug is right :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont like the 4c bid i feel it implies more defensive strength|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/wshould have bought ghis hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: I don't think NS were ever not bidding 5@C, question is whether EW should bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@S|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: 1444 is the worst|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: what will you miss by passing...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably 2S was artificial|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@s was 4@h|pg||
nt|asig: 6@d is makeable but not easy to bid|pg||
nt|cindy:  well  3N would show 4@h also|pg||
nt|asig: Especially after the 1NT opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@c forced 2@d and then 2@s shows 4@h|pg||
nt|cindy:  ok|pg||
nt|cindy:  gotcha|pg||
nt|marlowepi: TYVM Soren|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|cuttysark: West should know North has a singleton diamond|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that was not optimum|pg||
nt|mariner1: well the @c is now as good as the ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: They try to hide declarers hand|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|vugraphzmq: and all the suits breaking badly for the opposition|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So he can pick up South's trump now|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cuttysark: But that does not give him enough tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it is hard to see how the 5th defensive trick arises|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: hej VM|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 9 @C and 2@C, so one is a false discard ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors if i passed the W hand i would not be that eager to overcall. i don't want E to raise, really, and meanwhile N might have a bad 6-count so declarer might go down ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: several in 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S was thinking in 2 seconds before playing @c2|pg||
nt|cindy:  well at least he has the ace|pg||
nt|bridge_one: perhaps was more easy playing @S instead @C for the declarer|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mariner1: S wants them to break @D, does not know it does not matter|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: south can dream on|pg||
nt|asig: Declarer rises with the Ace in order to block the clubs, good play|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|cuttysark: Must concede a heart now|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But I think he has too much to do|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|caitlin: I wouldn't open the West hand and he takes chances with the overcall|pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: needs the spade finesse|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 9 in @S by North - nice guess by West|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, i would rather open and get it off my chest than overcall. but pass throughout is fine |pg||
nt|cindy:  looks like he is going minus only 200|pg||
nt|cindy:  100 maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: +110?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South has only 3 @H, so 1 down, not 2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in general i don;t like to open a one-bid on a 5422 10-count when i have 100 honors in a suit other than the one i am bidding :).  in a way i would rather open 1D, but would settle ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for pass|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|ahh: i agree with all this about 4441 hands i generally feel they play a king below their point count |pg||
nt|lestergold: it does matter south has the losing option not now|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: that west has rushed in|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: It's always an advantage to open the bidding. Defensive bidding is not as accurate|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one advantage of this NS method is that when N and S each have one (different) 4-card major, the opening leader doesnt know whether declarer has the major that dummy ddoesnt have. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it makes the lead harder (and maybe the later defense) compareed to more standard methods|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: good method for me, because when i open 1NT i usually want to hide my hand also :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6D a playable spot, though|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ahh: well if opps open your shortage you have a great defensive bid |pg||
nt|henryb: I think a king is excessive|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: now off needed to play spades|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||
nt|ahh: or is too old fashioned to double these days ?|pg||
nt|cindy:  not sure why n/s keep leading diamonds|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: Hi Henry|pg||

nt|roswolf: again acion likely |pg||
nt|roswolf: action|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s can make 4s if they guess the spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe N tried too hard to hide his hand. couldnt he bid 3D over 2S? |pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree, to open 1@S with all hcp out and 10 hcp isn't a good idea|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and no shortness|pg||
nt|cindy:  they never tried to shorten him|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Now 16+ clubsystem|pg||
mb|1C|an|16+ or 15 bal|nt|roswolf: no since the timing for the trump coup would be ok|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS can handle 4@S if they get there, with careful play|pg||
mb|1S|nt|idc: The auction in the other room seems a little surprising|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S is not enough|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i guess they dont play that as forcing cindy :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: slam 50%, but here down|pg||
mb|d|an|bal UK|nt|roswolf: transfer break|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: e/w do not want to get too high in hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: might not see game level though|pg||
nt|lestergold: north will supe accept|pg||
nt|mariner1: E has to like his hand now|pg||
nt|lestergold: north has to too|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would bid 2nt here to show 4 trumps ++ max points|pg||
nt|lestergold: north must do something for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n may war oppos about hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: failing that, S might have tried 3D over 2NT. it is not as if the combined values are so thin that 3NT rates to hinge on the lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would we all Pass as W?|pg||
nt|cindy:  no|pg||
nt|cindy:  im a spade raiser|pg||
nt|bridge_one: uhmm, i don't no|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i'm a straight razor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: always go for the throat|pg||
nt|cindy:  heh|pg||
nt|cindy:  chic razor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would bid 3S before pass. that might work out badly, but it has a lot of upside. 2S seems normal|pg||
nt|cindy:  this is one where i would bid 3S   they are never going to stop and double|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the problem it is to give informations at declarer bidding the raise in @S - and with zero can be bad|pg||
nt|caitlin: I like transfer overcalls over strong club and 2@C strong|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: I like 4@S much better|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: N actully has 17+ so I do also|pg||
nt|lestergold: east is undeteered|pg||
nt|lestergold: south will bid 3s|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: and north will raise to game|pg||
nt|roswolf: or make a t/o double w|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well, we should bear in mind that apparently one of the hands N can have is a strong NT, which lessens the attractivenss of 3S a bit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C may be could be any balanced hand without stop in @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@c was not alerted by S|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It shows a strong hand because you don't pre-empt against a pre-empt|pg||
nt|ahh: so do i |pg||
nt|idc: Oh, it was a Benjaminised 2@c - even then, North has a little bit to contribute|pg||
nt|henryb: I suspect that N-S play Benjamin, where 2@c shows an Acol 2 bid and 2@d shows a gf|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: yes - they do|pg||
nt|ahh: even the great Albert (alleged inventor of it ) doesnt play it |pg||
nt|idc: EW have done well to limit the likely loss for Scotland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 300, 4 IMPs to CBAI. Next hand Stephen, please|pg||
nt|henryb: is he still around?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: one of the minors will probably be useful...|pg||
nt|ahh: yes|pg||
mb|4H|nt|cuttysark: This may come down to a diamond guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: west has done quite enuf|pg||
nt|roswolf: now for the play|pg||
nt|lestergold: so all on reading the spade position|pg||
nt|mariner1: interesting K&R show it as 16.5 however DK = 18|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Denmark recently signed the treaty accepting the idea of a slam bonus, so NS were really carrying the "hide declarer's hand" principle too far|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now can arrive at slam (:|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not now, sry|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i thought south would make the cue in @s over 3@h|pg||
nt|marlowepi: superficially looks like a possible misunderstanding, but pairs who play strong club encounter the auction 1C-1S by opp with depressing frequency, so they should know their methods|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the bid i was expecting from S pver 3H was 3NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@H by South it is intelligent - beacause more richt give the minimum of hand that the control in @s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: right()|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if S doesnt bid 3NT, they will never play there, and why shouldnt it be the right contract some of the time?|pg||
mb|5C|an|cue|nt|mariner1: I guess K&R reduce it for AQ @c|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you if club not set up then long dims will take care of club loser|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt was a perfect choice, agree|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|an|!s cue|nt|marlowepi: his hearts are terrible and his minor suit help might mean 9 tricks in NT with 4H going down|pg||
nt|cindy:  uhoh|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N wants to correct to 4H that is fine also|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i have a feeling that EW will be overcalling a lot in the rest of this match when NS open 1C :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D is a squeeze cuebid - means control in @S (the suit where North don't bid control|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I think 3nt could be unserious/serious|pg||
nt|cindy:  :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt is perfect - 2 stop in @S, no shortness, minimum (otherwise 3@s)|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: one obstacle down|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht discard of course of no value to declarer|pg||
nt|roswolf: oh well|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N/S discussed board 2. S was not sure aff 4@h in N. That was wrong|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: well|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N might have made 6H, as it would be somewhat attractyive to E to lead a D, playing W for the queen. but S is doomed|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: x was unlimited|pg||
pc|s2|nt|caitlin: that may be why South bid 4@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my opinion, what is "unserious" is playing 3NT as artificial when no more than an 8 card fit has been promised|pg||
nt|bridge_one: too much value in @h for N/S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: It is a (loosing) finesse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E is right to think a long time|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cuttysark: Or not :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Club now for an easy set|pg||

pc|sK|nt|cuttysark: Worth a thought when there are no overtricks - more tempting if NS were vulnerable|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: 6c is two way its inmsurance again st vul opps makingh 5h and its slam if partner is good|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now @C|pg||
nt|caitlin: I think @H7 signalling for diamond|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East will make the contract only discarding on @D and playing @D from dummy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is a namyats hand in playing strength, yes. the problem with opening 4D is that you need specific stuff in specific places and it will be awkward looking for it at that level, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as there may be no safety at the 5 level. for slam purposes i would rather open 1S. with hearts, though, i would open 4C|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: @cA, @cq and @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: but a club is best|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South is thinking at a hand like  @S@S@S@S@S@S, xxx @D Kx@C inEast|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in this case must play @D|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bridge_one: plauing bridge it is very important to guess :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: 4S is a practical bid because NS may have a cheap save. also at these colors 4S cannot be chopped liver so you arent really underbidding by much|pg||

nt|cuttysark: She?|pg||

nt|mariner1: N ears perked up|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: from where did the 9th trick come?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the Dbl is a way to receive informations about the distribution of North - 3@s would be a other choice|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S know 6@c in N and 10-15|pg||
mb|4S|an|Splint|nt|lestergold: wst had better button it up here|pg||
nt|caitlin: interesting splinter with an Ace|pg||
nt|othered1: since south isn't limited, the splinter seems OK.  North won't overvalue south's hand inthis context|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: not known to be timid is Sam |pg||
nt|idc: I seem to have been asking that same question all weekend Henry|pg||
nt|ahh: the defence |pg||
nt|idc: and the answer is usually: the defenders :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: heart switch?|pg||
nt|paulhac: A comfortable 4S but slam can be made double dummy|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I guess you can make 6@S, but unlikely to bid it :)|pg||
nt|paulhac: Hi Liz|pg||
nt|mariner1: N has to know S is short in @c|pg||
nt|mariner1: that makes his hand worth a K or A more|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: all pass would now be sanity|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it is|pg||
nt|mariner1: not to me...... N had a raise|pg||
nt|caitlin: with an Ace?|pg||
mb|5S|an|2A and Q|nt|lestergold: well Rob occasionally i disagree with u|pg||
nt|mariner1: you know your hand is worth a K or A more, and you have cards in between you|pg||
nt|mariner1: and S,,,,,, time to raise|pg||
nt|bridge_one: giving the control of 3th round in @C (haveing 4 cards raise)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and hoping the @C arn't 3/0 :)|pg||
nt|othered1: got the idea across, and north seemed to rightly value his red controls.  BW does the rest|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East led away from the @HQ twice|pg||
nt|henryb: its more problematic with a stiff K or Q, which may promote tricks and don't show up in Blackwood|pg||
mb|6C|nt|lestergold: 4 of his 5 points not working too hard|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: one normally does not like to have stiff ace for a splinter, but here S esily has splinter values even without that ace|pg||
nt|caitlin: known 10 card fit South upgrades to show Queen|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Good bidding and a good contract|pg||
nt|othered1: I think this was an excellent auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would bid 3@S immediatly because East (after dbl at 2@S) could have cards to bid 4@S and after ii become all more difficult|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahh: which was twice too many |pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 13 tricks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: First time declarer played low from dummy, second time she could not avoid winning the 8 in hand|pg||

nt|ahh: no chance north plays this 1 |pg||
nt|henryb: its like the newspapers|pg||
nt|mariner1: only part scores here|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very favourable layout and south'shand on thelayout was worth more than his bids had shown in effect|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if playing a weak NT, the case for double is stronger|pg||
nt|henryb: if you are going to cue @s, undoubtedly 4@s would be better than 3, since 3 would, I think, be looking for a stopper for 3N|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|3H|an|0-6|nt|ahh: so far as scotland are concerned run of flat games is all they need |pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably S doubled because he thought a 4-4 heart fit might be the best strain. that might be true at the game level, but at the slam level clubs should be better. and S has slam ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: values. that is why I would bid 4S directly over 2S|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac: They will do well to reach 4@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: still risky though, obviously. the sort of call that would become genuinely attractive if a swing were needed|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, 4@s immediatly better that 3@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome Henry|pg||
nt|caitlin: but North could have 4 hearts |pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Henry:)|pg||
nt|othered1: And doyou think 4@S -- using all t hat room, so it should be a very specific hand -- is better than the approach south took?|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, perhaps, but 4@s does not leave very much room for manoeuvre|pg||
nt|henryb: no; with all those high cards it is unlikely that they can preempt high|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: the problem is: 2@C 2@s dbl 4@s ...|pg||
mb|d|nt|idc: bidding is easy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If I open 4@H with that hand, my partner has @SQ, @HK and @DA|pg||
nt|ahh: i like 4@H until p turns up with @H  K and @D AK|pg||
nt|idc: pick the most likely game, bid it, then make it ... next board|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N might have some play from S,,, how to bid that|pg||
nt|mariner1: and N bid NT here 1st anyway|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is E held even the heart TEN he might well just blast 4H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: over 1C|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac: Not now:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i do thinkl an immediate 4S is better, because NV  W might raise spades|pg||
nt|dburn:  since all partner can do over it is sign off or bid Blackwood|pg||
nt|othered1: The loss of space would make me think twice before bidding it.  |pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: 2h the normal spot|pg||
nt|dburn:  at any rate, West has a particularly vile problem in this auction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not me. no problem when you are compensating for loss of space by showing a very specific hand, and leaving RKC available|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: I suppose it is too much to expect that partner's KQ would be in @d and that she might hold the @hK in addition?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: so there are at least 3 hands to make slam easy |pg||
nt|ahh: Ian find a 4th |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 2@H nice and calm|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: life hasn't taught you to expect disappointment every time?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He will find the grand slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: adn should be held to 2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this will quietly go down two probably|pg||
nt|henryb: 3N unusual or to play?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: not a good contract|pg||
nt|dburn:  he may have hoped that 3NT showed the minors|pg||
pc|hT|nt|paulhac: It needed to be played by West to have any chance|pg||
nt|lestergold: on this lead at any rate|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl by North would work in this hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: no alert|pg||
nt|dburn:  on the grounds that two hands tha could not enter the auction at their first turns could not want to play in 3NT, but...|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: it seems normal to win and lead D jack|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
pc|d7|nt|othered1: I still like south's getting @H into the auction early, which made north's later decision trivial.  |pg||
nt|dburn:  North can't double because West will run, and he can't necessarily handle 4@d|pg||

nt|ahh: as expected we have now overtaken the other room |pg||
nt|ahh: this is a massive hand |pg||
nt|Walddk2: But slam has problems|pg||
nt|Walddk2: at least 6NT has|pg||
nt|ahh: 6@S may not be the best spot in practice|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West should perhaps have held back a littel with so much wasted in hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam cold|pg||
nt|lestergold: very good heart slam here|pg||
nt|lestergold: doesnt even need qd onside|pg||
nt|cindy:  something went wrong|pg||
nt|marlowepi: where?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: It was 2 down|pg||
nt|cindy:  club discard|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 7@C ...  less one - so better call 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: E ask: Was it minors. V: No, I had 11p. S: I had a maximum|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 7@S|pg||
mb|2D|an|multi|nt|marlowepi: i dont see why the final contract simply wasnt 3H|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: If you could separate them you have 12 top tricks in NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: clubs were trump|pg||
nt|cindy:  lol|pg||
nt|cindy:  i came in at the end|pg||
nt|cindy:  was fixin tea    srrrry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: glad to have your eagle eye back :)|pg||
mb|2N|an|Asking|nt|ahh: this really could bust the event |pg||
nt|lestergold: altho it is|pg||
nt|lestergold: should be reached easily tho|pg||
nt|mariner1: slam on a hook, drop, or lead very reasonable|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D multi|pg||
nt|bridge_one: foe west the multi is a great information, having 9 cards very good in the majors :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now North is thinking the level to bid his @D|pg||
mb|4D|nt|lestergold: no hook needed the clubs take care of thrid dim|pg||
nt|cindy:  well|pg||
mb|4S|an|!s|nt|paulhac: It looks like a comfortable 3NT but it goes off on a diamond lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They can't avoid getting to slam. Any bets?|pg||
nt|idc: plenty of scope for minus scores EW, 6NT West looks like the money contract but that's just on this layout|pg||
nt|marlowepi: must be Lapse-ing Soochong tea|pg||
nt|cindy:  my eagle eye said something iw weird with this auction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or "Constant Comment"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: great hand for East after long in @d at opps - he know the p must be short|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, there is no arguing that 4S should show spades in this sequence...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Yes, a great hand for her|pg||
mb|6S|nt|paulhac: But surely West will lead a heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: both ace clubs wrong and qd and its still infrangible|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but north has a monster opposite an opener|pg||
nt|cindy:  hahaha|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: hmm, and West can duck the @sQ anyway, so maybe nothing makes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Best to lead a heart against 2NT so opponents realise they may have missed a game :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: so likely to be bid in both rooms for a push|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is surely an easy slam to bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: they perhaps play 2Nt Gf |pg||
nt|bridge_one: and 3@c inviting|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, the interference is helping the side with the cards, as so often happens. still, it is not like N can pass....|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: No, invit+|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: much too easy for roland|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|dburn:  actually, you could play pass to show hearts and 4@h to show spades, if you were worried about a diamond lead through partner's hand|pg||
nt|othered1: West couldn't work out how to intelligently decide on 7 and did the practical thing|pg||
nt|dburn:  but that may be carrying a sound principle too far|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: W: Maybe I am to good|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree totally david, but if 4S is in the menu it is gonna have to show spades|pg||
nt|bridge_one: invit + is better for West - easy call slam |pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: 3@C Puppet   3@D at least one 4-card major   3@H = spades|pg||
nt|idc: no, in that case you can use North to reach the dummy|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|paulhac: Its not a gtreat game but vulnerable with 25 points many pairs would have reached it. Even on the heart lead it needs the A@D right|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|henryb: 6N is actually easy. say a minor suot lead. you win, cash the @dKJ and lead the @sQ|pg||
nt|ahh: 1 of my mentors always said never introduce poor 4 card suits in big auctions |pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: cant  be beaten with a viking axe|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps a dabish one!? with superhuman powers?|pg||
nt|roswolf: danish|pg||
pc|d5|nt|idc: I've left it till last, but 6@d is ok too but hard to see them getting to that|pg||
pc|s3|nt|paulhac: Good Pyschology Liz:)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahh: how right that advice often turns out |pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2D presumably showed an unidentified major, perhaps in a particular strength-range|pg||
nt|dburn:  West might have just taken a shot at seven (perhaps bidding 5NT first), but his actual view is not unreasonable|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Is 7 good?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|henryb: when S ducks, cash the @sA and the clubs and play @hA and another|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: yes, piece of cake|pg||
nt|Walddk2: when you are a spectator|pg||
nt|ahh: and the hand written up in scotland on sunday |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D  0 or 3|pg||
nt|lestergold: and that will be oyall|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|henryb: two high diamonds and the @sQ does not seem so hard|pg||
nt|ahh: now it will only be written up in the friday edition of the Scotsman   it deals with disasters|pg||
nt|roswolf: next|pg||
pc|s9|nt|roswolf: rehi|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: yes, 2@d was multi.|pg||
nt|dburn:  not bad - not cold, but not bad|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the grand slam it is near to be impossible - only finding sgl in @C or the K in @c - so 6@s is reasonable (5@D would instead to search grand slam)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|sT|pc|h4|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|dburn:  worse on a club lead than any other (unless played by West, of course)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|idc: With the fragile heart position, 6@s could have been better than 6NT, just one of those things|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it doesnt seem to me that W needed to give up on finding a grand. what could go wrong by bidding 6D? if E has club king & the spades we expect he will go on|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|roswolf: konow not on the scoreboard so far this set|pg||

nt|henryb: I know, and the director has a strange view of the law|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can't be serious, Stephen|pg||
nt|ahh: another 4-1 @S break |pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: mildly|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West carefully holds declarer to 11 tricks - hard not to feel bad about that|pg||
nt|roswolf: big fits where will the music stop?|pg||
nt|roswolf: straightforward hand here|pg||
nt|lestergold: not quite a game here for e/w|pg||
nt|dburn:  but even then, you can pitch two clubs on the top hearts and hope to play a complete cross-ruff for thirteen tricks|pg||
nt|dburn:  during which, if @hQ or @cK puts in an early appearance, so much the better|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You really want to play the hand out in the hope that one defender revokes when you know you are 1 down?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5@D looks good|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: It was good then..|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or if you discover it hidden in your own hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|henryb: we had one earlier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That would not be bridge they way I know it|pg||
nt|ahh: we also had 13 penalty cards on friday |pg||
nt|ahh: leading just :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: just a thought - not a suggestion|pg||
nt|henryb: the operator had a problem because BBO would not permit a revoke|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 2@C must include a weak 2@D option|pg||
nt|paulhac: North south can make 5@D and it may be difficult for East/Wesr to realise they need to save|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s will be bid and off is my prediciton|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i might take a small piece of that|pg||
nt|lestergold: north only needs to lead Ac and see partners doubleton showing card|pg||
nt|roswolf: north may bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H lead might confuse things|pg||
nt|lestergold: its only a small non vulnerable piece |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: No, It did not show any strength range. Just not a 2suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: maybe 5@HX ?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a lot to think about|pg||
nt|ahh: that tip appered in a book called 101 winning edges by a ruthless author |pg||
nt|henryb: double with the N hand would not cross my mind|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNNG ****  LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  SCOTLAND 91, N-IRELAND 88, ENGLAND 80, IRELAND  72, CBAI 71, WALES 44 ****|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: very much so:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht lead wrong when  you have an ak that partner is never going to expect if you dont lead it|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c cash is the play though...... to see dummy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D is sufficient - if East hold control in @C he would bid over 5@s, otherwise would bid 5@s, after 6@S by West and finish the bid|pg||
mb|2N|an|14+, UK|nt|idc: agree, 2@d looks better|pg||
nt|cuttysark: -300 is not a big deal against -400|pg||
nt|paulhac: Rather too strong for a weak 2@D in my book|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Of course the defenders may not find their spade ruff...|pg||
nt|roswolf: AGREE|pg||
nt|henryb: or when they do not lead a trump and you find partner with 4(+) @d|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, you are going on to 6S whatever E does, so i think W should just jump straight to 6D over 4S, to let E know immediate;ly how close to a grand they are|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: full of all the coffeehousing tricks known to man |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not mine either but when she does, South has no problem|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: no error here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: What is this 3@C all about?|pg||
nt|ahh: forcing |pg||
nt|ahh: in this tournament @S break badly i am not bidding them |pg||
nt|idc: to find a 4-4 @s fit, but then I'll bet she worried that 3@s wouldn't be forcing (it should be) |pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: i have a 4c major and a @C stop and a good hand|pg||
nt|idc: 3@s after the 3@c 3@d continuation I mean|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Nort has worked out what partner has - and now very difficult to save|pg||
nt|paulhac: Cannot critice East's X|pg||
nt|roswolf: that double will cost|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well, the 4@H maybe suggests a lack of defence there, and what else do you have?|pg||
nt|roswolf: west mightsave the day|pg||
nt|paulhac: If West knew that south had opened a weak 2@D hhe would not have bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: to see partners card|pg||
nt|lestergold: no doubt uidca|pg||
nt|dburn:  it wasn't easy, though. There are matches where you'd win 13 IMPs just for being in six, though obviously this high-class affair is not one of them.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after all, the 4S call gives W about a one-loser hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: W and S is discussing board 10|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|an|cue|nt|roswolf: well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: no double? no trouble|pg||
nt|paulhac: Great result for E/W|pg||
nt|paulhac: That will be 2 on the trot will N/S be reeling?|pg||
nt|cindy:  would you dbl second time with E hand or 3N ?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt is 16+ bal ? |pg||
nt|marlowepi: and i don;t think it is clear at all that E would bid 6C over 5D every time he has club king. what if his spades are ATxxxx and he has no shape? and maybe E thinks the point of 5D ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: was especially to fetch a much more convenient HEART cuebid?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ok, seen - 15/17|pg||
nt|othered1: brb|pg||
mb|4H|an|Cue|nt|ahh: this has better chances than 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This is not a good board for Scotland|pg||
nt|lestergold: peter completed|pg||
mb|4N|nt|vugraphzpf: Ups|pg||
nt|cindy:  has a chance|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not keen on 3N with only one ace and non-flexible heart stopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: goodbye vienna|pg||
mb|5H|an|2A no Q|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 4S might easily be on on 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: will guess heart now|pg||
mb|6C|nt|cindy:  should guess it|pg||
nt|cindy:  now she knows N has diamond ace should be easy to guess   and also S might have led a heart with Qx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also prefer 3H to 2H by N on first round, by a lot|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: slam doomed. if W opens a strong NT at other table, the final contract might well be 6C making|pg||
nt|henryb: this one should be less successful|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: well 2nt was 14+ and UK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @D lead beat|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: and off as someone predicted :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: copenhagen i mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: should make now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She can't avoid making it|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahh: running score 91 to 88 vps |pg||
nt|Walddk2: diamond finesse comes next|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: UK is GF|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ty|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hK|nt|idc: so the effect of the negative double was to prevent them finding their 4-4 fit, with all the room in the world|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not a great hand for NS's method|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps easier to guess, but not by that much since S is a passed hand and N has a lot of leeway. it's the non-heart lead that will drive the guess, and that does not depend on the ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: D ace|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes i agree  |pg||
pc|h9|nt|idc: bidding is contrary sometimes :)|pg||
nt|ahh: this closes game right up  getting exciting |pg||

nt|mariner1: this session the score is 19 all|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@S EW?|pg||
nt|lestergold: interesting hand e/w hav e plenty of long suits but its the4/4 spade fit that is i think their best spot for a game |pg||
nt|roswolf: relatively difficult for e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: not easy |pg||
nt|lestergold: the bidding could go pear shaped here very easily|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: E bidding a @S here works|pg||
nt|marlowepi: strongly disapprove of the opening lead. the auction makes it clear N has at least nine cards in the majors, and S does not have three entries. just lead a heart and hope.|pg||
nt|cindy:  do you think S more likely to lead a heart if N had bid 3H ?|pg||
mb|1C|an|16+ or 15 bal|nt|roswolf: especially if east bids 2@C|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|an|Forcing|nt|idc: In other room, Scotland look to be beating 4@s - three rounds of @d to start|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S now?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no, not this particular S. if he didnt lead a heart on this auction from this hand, probably he wouldnt lead one on any auctioin|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S said "sorry pd"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3NT a rather lucky make here|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  appropriate|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: 2@S is cool|pg||
nt|lestergold: east should bid his 4 card major at first opportunity|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: and they found it|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps a 4@D splinter was not out of placew|pg||
mb|p|mb|r|an|SOS|nt|paulhac: Interesting X|pg||
nt|cuttysark: South is checking the deck - a lot of good hands about|pg||
nt|cuttysark: A moment for discipline - forget the missed games|pg||
nt|paulhac: Will he be content with 3NT after the last 2 boards|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, it takes a big man to apologize. or maybe just a really bad lead LOL|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well he was prerpared to risk a reverse but on a ten count with a possible misfit it clould have been dangerous|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S and W was surprised that N had 7|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahh: ROI still +4 v NI   so scotland just leading and no more |pg||
nt|roswolf: but 4nt is interesting|pg||
nt|cindy:  do you think acknowledging a mistake at the table helps the opponents at all ?|pg||
nt|henryb: 1@sX sort of gruesome, as is anything else|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but land on feet|pg||
nt|roswolf: absolutely|pg||
nt|mariner1: some times you have to stick your neck out|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: up with that pesky ace and play trump lose a club and one or two spades|pg||
nt|mariner1: win and run the J@S best here|pg||
nt|cindy:  i know the opps can feed off of a heated discussion at the table|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it does a bit, perhaps, but it does a lot more good for partner than it does for the opps|pg||
mb|d|nt|idc: South had overcalled @d in other room, this is a tougher lead for North here|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep|pg||
nt|cindy:  thats a good point|pg||
mb|r|an|SOS|nt|henryb: 5@c is a MUCH better contract, and I think W should raise clubs over 3@s: partner must have only 2|pg||
nt|ahh: up to 3 imps is a draw |pg||
nt|roswolf: double from someone?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure why E ran before getting doubled in 1NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now means 3/3 red|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: so it cant really be any closer |pg||
mb|2H|nt|paulhac: Out of the frying pan.....|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This will definitely be a minus score|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They have very few thus far...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ideal is for N to head S apology off at the pass by saying the likes of "I would have made the same lead, pd"|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulhac: When North passed 2@D south should have backed off|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i do not understand the logic of souths bidding - opposite 2 aces and the club queem he thinks slam is cold - wierd|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cindy:  ahh|pg||
nt|cindy:  and then giving him hell later ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and then of course N is free to continue the sentence in his own head: "...if i had your brain, that is"|pg||
nt|cindy:  lolol|pg||
nt|bridge_one: nice bid by East - immediatly 2@c don't work|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bridge_one: rbl and after 2@c give the information to have 4 cards in other suit|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|idc: Victor Silverstone in spec has made the same point Henry, quite right too|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H to A and another @S|pg||

nt|marlowepi: since NS could not quite make 4H, they were right to defend this contract doubled instead of bidding the heart game :)|pg||

mb|3C|nt|mariner1: correct and not easy at that|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: ten tricks making hwere|pg||
nt|dburn:  the grand slam was missed at the other table also on board 10, but 11 and 12 are not great for Koch-Palmund, and time is running out|pg||
mb|3N|nt|golfsquash: 4@h cannot be made against best defence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: THis will seal it for Scotland I think|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: not that any more hsould have been bid|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzpf: Yes, their name are Koch-Palmund|pg||

nt|lestergold: very odd whats wrong with establishing clubs|pg||
nt|cindy:  bad spades & bad shape outweigh the two aces i guess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but with 9 losers and terrible trumps, i think dioscretion is the better part of vlaor|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 10 imp to Konow|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Board 11 it is|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W was lucky in spades there. perhaps he should bid something else over 3C hoping he can wheedle a 3NT bid out of E with a semi-stop|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahh: considering the pressure |pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|bridge_one: in board 11 east in open room after 1@S  2@C , 2Nt  choose to bid 3Nt instead 3@c |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S will not duck twice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he cant bid 3S over 3C, because then too easy to miss cold 3NT when E has no semi-stop|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|lestergold: decided to elope with hearts and forget about the clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: but that isnt enuf tricks for 2s cant be the correct line|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a useful rule of thumb when you have a close decision is: if at least 1/3 of your Losing Trick Count is in your trump suit, don;t get too excited|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good switch|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|roswolf: i think he had a clear cut hand to bid slam and should have tried 5BT = pick a slam - a hand for a bidding challenge?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: I wished on Friday that EW here would play transfer bids after 1M Dbl, but they haven't changed yet|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I would bid out my shape - diamonds then spades twice. Partner might have very little in hearts...|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think leaping michaels should apply in this situation where 4@D would show a spade /diamond 2 suiter|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, weak 2s on 7-card suits make me ill, though many top players would disagree|pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that might push EW higher, and in any case against 4S N might have to decide whether or not to underlead diamonds at trick 3|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|paulhac: With so many high cards there is also a case for South to cue|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: West has @h K|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: S is thinking|pg||

mb|3H|nt|bridge_one: hover ruffing a @H, playing @s, North would make the contract, bec leave the K in @H at West, so can entry in the dummy ruffing  a @s |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Jim Hay|pg||
nt|idc: This might be a quiet game, or just possibly a more exciting slam hand|pg||
nt|ahh: not sure by the end i will have any fingernails left |pg||
mb|4H|nt|idc: My sympathies are with the non-playing captains|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I'd adise them to hit the bar now - one of them will find it helps to get a start|pg||
nt|paulhac: I like Wests action|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Doesn't do to be overawed just because 1NT calls itself 'strong'|pg||
nt|roswolf: will north double to show the suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why was that good? cold on normal S king lead|pg||
nt|cindy:  4S for me now|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|cuttysark: Redbl presumably suggests playing in the other suit, assuming it is not clubs|pg||
nt|paulhac: I wonder if they have discussed the follow up sequences after a xx|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has done enough?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|an|Q?|nt|cindy:  now, how to make it|pg||
nt|asig: Not the dummy Christiansen was dreaming about|pg||
mb|p|nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE  LIMERICK ****  N-IRELAND 93, SCOTLAND 91, ENGLAND 78,  CBAI 71, IRELAND 67,  WALES 46  ****|pg||
mb|5N|nt|paulhac: Surprised East passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i don;t waste my time dreaming about dummies, i dream about the real thing :)|pg||
nt|asig: :)|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: NS have actually gainsed on the board where the defended 5@H undoubled: 3 imps when 6@D was also -1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: Not that 6@s is a very good contract but w/o a @d lead I expect 12 tricks are there|pg||
nt|ahh: @D lead certainly sinks it  but how to play on a non @D lead ?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: good bid, good slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 5nt = no Q|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|cuttysark: This shoulod make now the diamonds position has been clarified|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|idc: draw trumps, lead a @c up maybe - you may need the @h finesse as well |pg||
pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: N will plan a campaign to give him a chance if trumps are 4-0 offside|pg||

nt|mariner1: ty Geoffrey :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: still, N can hardly bid less. unlucky after the opening bid to have 2 heart losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Last board|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: in this segment|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Last board today, thx all for being here. See you tomorrow|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Martin's hand is dificult to handle|pg||
nt|paulhac: Thanks everyone got to go|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Only 10 imps in it - but potential for huge swings on boards 12, 13 & 14|pg||
mb|1C|an|16+ or 15 bal|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: She knows she'll get 2@C next|pg||
nt|mariner1: all roads to 3N here it seems|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thanks again for such a fabulous job soren|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: No!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That makes life a lot easier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I actually like 2@H very much|pg||
nt|idc: I much prefer the 2@h rebid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Available for a game some day, Ian?|pg||
nt|idc: one day I'll get there ahead of you Roland .. maybe|pg||
nt|idc: Now she has a different problem - how/if to investigate a perfect fitting possible slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  nothing appears to make here|pg||
mb|2N|an|15 bal NF|nt|cuttysark: 6 imps to Konow here - perhaps South has too much defence for the pre-emptive jump|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: Virtually impossible to investigate with any certainty|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H is a practical bid|pg||
nt|ahh: if you need a perfect fit to make assume it will not be there and stay low |pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: next session in 75 minutes|pg||
nt|lestergold: and most if not all roads to 11 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade lead 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: When there is a danger of getting to 5 level down one, I think that's right|pg||
nt|cuttysark: As North does for his pre-emptive opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: spades mullered |pg||
nt|lestergold: ten of cxlubs dropping on round two of the suit guaranteeding 3 club tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: so prediction a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: http://www.bridge.dk/  - Tournament site|pg||
nt|cindy:  guess can make it with club lead and heart guess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tough to lead a spade|pg||
nt|bridge_one: TY all commentators, ty Soren :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ty kibitz ! :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cindy:  now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N will win & flog EW with diamonds|pg||
nt|cindy:  that wont get him 3 heart tricks though|pg||
nt|asig: Right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i didnt say play all of them|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: just 3?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he will play 3 to see what discards are made|pg||
nt|cindy:  3 is all he needs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: costly lead as it turns out|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: though N still has some guessing to do|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cuttysark: Sorry: North is the She|pg||
nt|lestergold: 11 claimed quickly|pg||
nt|lestergold: in a moment |pg||
nt|mariner1: Mike not suffering from Wiccaphobia this session :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is wiccaphobia?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i fall for it|pg||
nt|mariner1: close as I could get to "curses" :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: curses?|pg||
nt|lestergold: vot yah mean?|pg||
nt|mariner1: fear of Witches and Witchcraft|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah when do i suffer from that?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Fascinating stuff - hope you enjoyed it. Bye all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now he will make|pg||
pc|sK|nt|asig: heart discard from both?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: whoever shows spade ace, he will play likely the other hand for heart queen. that would mean going down here|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|mariner1: as in Commentator's Curse...... you don't I said :)  you have been risking making|pg||
nt|mariner1: predictions|pg||
