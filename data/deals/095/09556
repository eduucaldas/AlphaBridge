nt|mariner1: hi all :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|santyclz: The "dottir" part is a clue.|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure you can make slam |pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@C looks very far off |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: ty|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks more like it |pg||
mb|3C|nt|mariner1: http://www.bridge.is/mot/gomul-mot/2008-2009/sveitakeppni---urslit-2009/ -|pg||
nt|mariner1: Tournament site|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely a mistake opertor?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: its frigid|pg||
nt|lestergold: but that doesnt mean its biddable|pg||
nt|roswolf: did south really bid 2nt?|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 6@C looks cold|pg||
nt|lestergold: less than 50%|pg||
nt|lestergold: but too good fro roland|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridge.is/results  -  running scores in all matches - Results|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Rob|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: 2n must be very forcing!|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: looks like 2/1|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam could well be bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: he started with 2 @C seems to me 2/nt  would be forcing  |pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: i think finis|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Basically 5 is on 1 of 2 and reasonable breaks.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: oh well spade game - not as good as club game but no probs here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: 4/1 spade break and club finesse wrong and this could go off where as you need sledgehammer to beat the club game|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|santyclz: Though a trump out might have made it tricky.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|sybarra: not easy to lead stiff trump IMO |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: not many sledgehammers in bridge clubs mike!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: hard  to get to a minor suit slam when you have a 8 card major fit and less than|pg||
nt|mariner1: optimum count|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra: esp. when pard X'd @D |pg||
nt|lestergold: this is true Rob|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|roswolf: ty shirley!|pg||
nt|mariner1: some end in dottir|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: i would be tempted to bid as west|pg||
nt|roswolf: as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Only one woman in this event and she is sitting out in this set. Ljósbrá is her name and she plays for Skeljungur|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Surnames are not used much in Iceland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The phone book is sorted by first names|pg||
nt|sybarra: now east might be tempted to bid |pg||
mb|5D|nt|lestergold: east must surely raise|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@D is a lot of temptation :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh raised a distance too far |pg||
nt|sybarra: well yes seems he did |pg||
nt|roswolf: should support but maybe that is a tad too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: two distances too far 3d the limit|pg||
mb|d|nt|santyclz: Yesterday in the JEC match we saw a case where in spite of his pd's x, Nevio lead a trump.  He was right.  Since I'm not of his class if pd makes a lead-directing x, I lead it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: can N sit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and n/s looks to be a trick short in 4 @H |pg||
nt|roswolf: should pass the double - nowhere really to go|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe even 2 tricks |pg||
nt|lestergold: 4d preemptive enuf if anything but as it happens the 2 level is the limit for n/s|pg||
nt|mariner1: how are they in 5 of anything|pg||
nt|lestergold: every finesse wronmg for n/s but e/w have 4 top losers in their contract|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Guðmundur Páll Arnarson was a member of the Icelandic gold medal team (Bermuda Bowl) in 1991|pg||
nt|mariner1: since N has not already passed this worries me|pg||
nt|roswolf: while north thinks hope will flourish|pg||
nt|lestergold: rush of blood to east's head- he got busy.....very busy ..... much too busy....|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed rob|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: N works it out|pg||
nt|roswolf: got it right!|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump lead?|pg||

nt|roswolf: east may not be amused at his pards shape and west will rue his pard's enterprise|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: or was that the "get out" bid?|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think the 4@d bid was forced, his pd was unlimited at that point.|pg||

nt|roswolf: more fun here likely|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW have a slam, can they bid it,,,,,, should they?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: a bad slam but makeable mas cards lie|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: disposing of the fourth heart is a problem- slam canbe defeated by best defence|pg||

nt|roswolf: this one is anti% even for me|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: not sure you can finesse the @S and ruff the hearts |pg||
nt|roswolf: like the 3@H raise|pg||
nt|lestergold: east ios thinking of slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: and roland is there in the background nodding and encouraging him|pg||
nt|sybarra: east=our optimist |pg||
nt|roswolf: west has to back pedal now|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H showa better than a 4 @S call|pg||
nt|lestergold: west regrets having only three spades|pg||
nt|mariner1: E has a great hand in this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: east  does not need his partner to have much of a takeout double to make slam|pg||
mb|5C|nt|roswolf: indeed but he mustn't hang pard for bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 5s all pass hopefully|pg||
nt|roswolf: dangerous|pg||

nt|sybarra: then see what happens |pg||
pc|dT|nt|mariner1: Shirely thats because you never hold partner's suits|pg||

nt|roswolf: that looks a good raise bid by east|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 5d makes too|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: west will be thibnking of game/slam maybe in dims|pg||

nt|roswolf: 2@S is imaginative|pg||
nt|lestergold: this looks as if its going to the wrong denomination|pg||
nt|mariner1: W has to be worried, or should be worried, about S and N in auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: if east's majors had been reversed something nasty have happened|pg||
nt|lestergold: south produced quite an opener at red versus green|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3rd in hand etc etc:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not sure E can get to it now |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3c is technically right but i think the percntage bid by east is no trumps|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: colours - what relevance do they have nowadays!?|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe with such good hearts east should have bid them rather than unassuming cue bid but wasy after the event|pg||

nt|lestergold: even ten of clubs is right if you n eeded it|pg||
nt|santyclz: The w hand is still unlimited at that point, 3nt while practical gives up on slams since you have the @sa.  Without the ace, I'd agree.|pg||
