nt|sybarra: for 5 |pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes boring hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: did North ever say he hand @S?|pg||

nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|mariner1: a lot of the Icelandi's play transfers|pg||

nt|mariner1: 2@C is sort of a tell me more....|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe 2 @H shows no shortness or count or both|pg||
nt|roswolf: but i wish they would bid quicker on simple hands|pg||
nt|mariner1: told these are size then shape responses|pg||
nt|bobholl: even a simple double makes live for relayers sometimes difficult (not properly all situations discussed)|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe we are about to (or did) crash |pg||

nt|mariner1: this is a variant to Burn's Law|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm  - Burn's Laws|pg||
nt|bobholl: if 2nt garantuees @S which i presume than 4nt is avery normal bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: if east had bid out his hand pattern he west might have been in a similar dilemna|pg||
nt|mariner1: W should raise to 6 here,,,,, has a void and good trumps|pg||
nt|mariner1: would E have passed a 5 @S response? no so W has to bid slam|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ziff: He is behind.. he probably doesn't guess that he is 63 behind, but he is not going to let them have a strong club auction, not vulnerable|pg||
nt|bobholl: assuming 1@H is MF (kind off) it is enough |pg||
nt|mariner1: the 1@H in N showed @S I think....... or some unknown positive holding|pg||
