nt|royhughes: Chan opened somewhat light -- will he do so again?|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think most players would open the South hand in today's game|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|royhughes: It has some shape, good spots and 2 quick tricks, but it isn't enough for Chan|pg||

mb|3C|an|splinter diamond support|nt|royhughes: NS have a play for four spades, but not with the trump king wrong|pg||
nt|royhughes: 3@c must be a raise of some kind|pg||

nt|royhughes: EW do best to let the opponents play, doubled or not|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi All from the venue|pg||
nt|royhughes: Hi David|pg||
nt|davidstern: This event is to qualify one team (2nd) to the PABF Zone 6 playoffs where Zone 7 compete as invitees and one team for the Seniors Bowl in Sao Paulo|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@C presumably a diamond raise of some sort - perhaps limit|pg||
mb|5D|nt|davidstern: I like the 1@S overcall by North but know it isn't everybody's cup of tea|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Man Overboard|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: true, but 4@s has a play of sorts|pg||
nt|royhughes: if the trump king was onside|pg||
mb|5S|nt|royhughes: This is a lot of bidding by West and South, though|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|royhughes: It looks like Braithwait imagined short spades opposite|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes 4@S would then make perhaps|pg||
nt|royhughes: and Chan imagined longer spades opposite|pg||
nt|davidstern: I hate Chan's bidding his hand twice here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: I don't see bidding 5@s -- Chan doesn't have extra offense beyond his splinter raise|pg||
nt|davidstern: Surely 4@D showed what he had as a passed hand|pg||
nt|royhughes: He could have doubled to show the (slight) extra strength|pg||
pc|dK|nt|davidstern: With seeming two quick tricks and opps vul I would have taken a bite out of 5@D = 500|pg||
nt|royhughes: However, it is easier from here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|davidstern: So a swing of 800 on that decision|pg||
nt|royhughes: Haughie leads the king in case he wants to hold the lead|pg||
nt|royhughes: A good lead, I think|pg||
nt|royhughes: He may switch to a club|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|royhughes: 3NT would be a wonderful contract here|pg||
nt|athene: well west can bid 2@S if that's constructive, but east will just bid 4@S over that i guess|pg||
nt|royhughes: But 4@s is almost cold, too|pg||
nt|athene: i agree 3nt has the merit of being exactly 100% sure to make|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: ys, of course.  A quick look at their card shows me they play 4th suit game-forcing|pg||
nt|athene: if you have to go through 4th suit just to make a forcing jump rebid in your suit (or a forcing raise in partner's second suit) it can get awkward|pg||
pc|s3|nt|royhughes: I don't see much the defenders can do.  If they lead trumps to stop the club ruff, declarer can work on hearts|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: actually there's no reason for declarer to get hearts right|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|royhughes: With one partner, I played that 2@c denied holding 3 hearts -- then South can continue with 2@h on a doubleton if he has a good hand|pg||

nt|snorris: must be 1nt|pg||
nt|chick: probably :)|pg||
nt|athene: 5 @C 4@H isn't an ideal shape to open but with 3 spades you can raise the inconvenient 1@S response so you don't have that much of a rebid problem|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Something is wrong here|pg||
nt|chick: Our vugraph operator is Andrea Fischer.   Hi Andrea!!|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps the wrong hand is showing?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are supposed to start with board 31; maybe they didn't|pg||
nt|thegarve:  this was a hand from the last set|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzmc: they have got other cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sure they have|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This hand was played in the previous set|pg||
nt|chick: Roland and Andrea will get it sorted out soon :)|pg||
nt|snorris: what did they play?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Andrea, you must both shut down and load the correct file|pg||
nt|thegarve:  3nT -1|pg||
nt|royhughes: I'm sure some would -- it's pretty popular nowadays|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|athene: 3@C is pushy|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would have thought it was top end for a free 2@C - maybe that's a little cautious|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|royhughes: No, that makes sense to me, but so long as partner knows what you do, either way is ok|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|athene: 4@H needs a lot with partner - major-suit finesses are likely to fail, with south having a decent hand|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|royhughes: He may wind up ruffing a good spade in dummy to finesse trumps|pg||
