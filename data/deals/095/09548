nt|vugraphzmr: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: My Co-commentators are David Collier, Catherine Draper and Mark Horton and I am Geoffrey Wolfarth |pg||
nt|dburn: not much of an opening bid, those North cards, but these days almost anything goes|pg||
nt|ady: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: X = minor-major?|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi all |pg||
nt|jallerton: would you bid on the East hand?|pg||
nt|bobholl: losing 4@H and 2 aces 1nt will just make |pg||
nt|asnuttyas: Good afternoon all|pg||
mb|1N|an|18-20 unbalanced|nt|athene: hi good evening everyone |pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hi everyone|pg||

nt|roswolf: hi stephen - do we know the systems in use?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: not off hand...|pg||
nt|pkl: Okay... the first board. I just realise we are quite a small bunch. 2@S|pg||
nt|steshome: Hello all|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: just a little joke from the operator? :)|pg||
nt|mug: 1@S from North, 2@C South, 2@H North, 3@D South, 3@S North, 3NT South perhaps?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@S-2@c-2@H-3NT perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stayman was not out of the question|pg||
nt|athene: not only is it safe, but east gets to make two discards which might be helpful|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you were right in a way about the auction Bill. it was passed out. after the opening bid, that is :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes, stayman was a possibility with the north hand (intending to pass any rebid from opener)|pg||
nt|dburn: 1NT alerted - may be forcing, I guess, but about 2@c I am not sure|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: south is bidding a lot|pg||
nt|eggy: Just when West thought it was starting to look good|pg||
nt|henryb: then 2@h = pass or correct|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe South thinks it's a transfer and North doesn't|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case the final contract could be somewhat less than elegant|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Your commentators are Marshall Lewis and William Frisby|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@S looks makeable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the spades lie as lovely as could be|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk7: Player names please operator|pg||
nt|athene: south has a very nice hand, even if she doesn't have a name yet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: usually they make it through a few hands before they play anonymously|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a LOT off|pg||
nt|eggy: quite a poor bid by east on reflection|pg||
nt|sybarra: can the slam be bid?  |pg||
nt|sharkirl: Hi shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: guess not |pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Michael |pg||
nt|mug: interesting play probllem|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i can think of people who would open 2@C on that south hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi Catherine, Steve, Calle and Geoffrey. Havee fun :)|pg||
nt|dburn: not that there's much wrong with 2@d as a contract, but not by North-South|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  a bit of a push|pg||
nt|bobholl: does he think N had 5@H :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: she|pg||
mb|3D|nt|idc: Morning Peter, morning everyone|pg||
nt|pkl: So we ended in 3@C - sensible bidding everywhere|pg||
nt|pkl: Good morning Ian|pg||
nt|idc: This is a more open Lady Milne than for years, so I'm looking forward to an exciting day of bridge|pg||
nt|pkl: I might as S be tempted to bid 3@H - that singleton club looks really nice|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnc: Hi|pg||
nt|eggy: west almost guaranteed to hold 5 spade|pg||
nt|henryb: indeed: favorable breaks in all suits and @hA well placed|pg||
nt|mamos: whereas 1Nt would make so Catherine North has done well|pg||
nt|dburn: however, they seem to be on track|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.cbai.ie/documents/LadyMilneScoreboard1.pdf  for results and standing after round 3|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: hi roland will do|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a feisty auction and i am not sure whether this will be an objectively good result for the declaring side|pg||
nt|col3435: yes, how does 4@h do?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: this ought not to make, but with the favourable red suit position East-West could make about 2NT, so no great harm done|pg||
nt|sharkirl: quick clain when Sq appears|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: 2S plays well. but 1NT can make also|pg||
nt|col3435: seems to me like it might come in|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|athene: yes, there is the double heart finesse for declarer if she chooses to take it|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|dburn: still, not so obvious for West to play a red suit ace now, which is what she needs to do|pg||
nt|dburn: although I guess @d3 might also work|pg||
nt|dburn: and might be more accurate defence|pg||
nt|dburn: the point being that by playing diamonds twice more, West can in effect create a trump trick for herself|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sybarra: E's puny spade suit probably touted her off the slam |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: yes it may well but will e/w get there in the other room? n/s bidding i think helped|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: but now she really does need to play a diamond, and not...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dburn: ...a spade|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rnc: South was quite happy I suppose when seeing dummy with 5 spades|pg||
nt|dburn: now, provided Cath Jagger takes the right view of the clubs, she can succeed|pg||
pc|sK|nt|col3435: I'd say West always had enough to bid 4@h after East had raised|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Let's suppose North cashed a top club and then switched to the jack of diamonds - quite testing for declarer then |pg||
nt|sybarra: checking the @D break  |pg||
pc|s4|pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: it is all about the first round of hearts and cashing only one diamond before playing hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but she will surely throw a heart here|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c4|nt|rnc: yes|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: -800 seems predestined|pg||
nt|eggy: lucky it wasn't 1100 on that line|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|steshome: We need England to win 25:0 and ROI and CBAI to beat Northern Ireland and CBAI (haven't worked out the margins)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: now south gets squeezed in spades and diamonds|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|dburn: a dollar short and a day late for that diamond, but declarer still not home|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: maybe Jagger cannot play west for club queen on such a defence|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c7|nt|henryb: I think she should have ducked the first club|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: well, she would have done if declarer finessed hearts retaining a top diamond in hand|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hK|nt|athene: sorry *East* gets squeezed|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: since S needs heart king on regardless, the choice is between 3-3 diamonds and heart ten being onside. the latter is more likely|pg||
nt|sn00py27: E might have dbled with an Ace so should get right|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: has done|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe she can - good effort|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|dburn: might as well ruff a spade, just in case|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ady: could be good part score swing for england|pg||
pc|h8|nt|roswolf: commentator's curse|pg||

nt|sn00py27: hi|pg||
nt|henryb: your favorite 20-20, Roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Redbl here is I think a single suited rescue|pg||
nt|pkl: North has a difficult decision here - double or show hearts. No macro could solve that one, Roland|pg||
nt|idc: West will bid 2@c and East then reveals her suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: most likely a @c raise |pg||
nt|sybarra: also exploring for nt,  but 3nt be 1 too high|pg||
nt|mug: South must pass, any action zero|pg||
nt|mug: if partner can't bid over 1@S NS have nothing on, and EW may have a better contract|pg||
nt|mug: 1@D I meant|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Standing before the last round: 1. Northern Ireland 76 - 2. Scotland 74 - 3. England 61|pg||
mb|4S|nt|marlowepi: wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwww|pg||
nt|athene: although if north leads her partner's suit that will help|pg||
nt|athene: ouch|pg||
nt|mug: ok well judged by Mrs Nelson|pg||
nt|Walddk5: So realistically, only NI and Scotland can win the trophy from here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Scotland take on CBAI|pg||
nt|jallerton: West has an awkward hand to describe over 1NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: very hard to disagnose though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E took a real chance here...|pg||
nt|ady: tranfer to hearts     likely down 2 at 2 level|pg||
nt|dburn: may be one major, rather than a transfer|pg||
nt|mdgraham: web site at http://www.cbai.ie/|pg||
nt|mug: so if England score 25, not unlikely against bottom-placed Wales, they get up to 86 VPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north was doing the thinking :) i doubt east had to think too hard about that one|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure the auction should be taking this long|pg||
nt|dburn: not particularly sound whatever it is, mind|pg||
nt|dburn: still, no one can ever double anyone for penalties nowadays|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnc: This one will for sure be cheaper|pg||
nt|henryb: you are obviously not an accountant.|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i do have an oxford maths degree if it was cambrisge then id be able to add up|pg||
nt|henryb: Pender thinks she has died and gone to heaven|pg||
nt|lestergold: in oxford they only taught me how to punt|pg||
nt|mamos: horses or skiffs?|pg||
nt|henryb: there is a story of the CEO who wanted to find out what 2+2=|pg||
nt|henryb: He called in his economists. they said 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: without birth control 2+2 can equal quite a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i might have bid something over 1@C as east|pg||
nt|sybarra: although, might have the timing on a @H lead |pg||
nt|mug: would need specific results from the other two matches|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: decided against finding a 4-4 @H fit|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D distribution bit tricky :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: @sJ lead will knock out the entry|pg||
nt|jallerton: small @d to the J could be ducked by S|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sn00py27: I thought we might get an idea on this hand whether they play weak or strong NT :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In these times many East's would open - especially with an eye on the vulnerability|pg||
nt|sn00py27: E/W|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this should be easy enough|pg||
nt|idc: I think I like 2NT by South now - she has a little too much to give up on game|pg||
nt|pkl: 3NT really sounds like "STOP". Can West find the diamond lead?|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: could be and should be|pg||
nt|steshome: Good lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: probably better to play in 7D. at least you go off only one when diamonds break your heart|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D must be showing something like north's hand - and south ought to be getting mildly excited|pg||
nt|col3435: some convention cards at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/lmteams.htm|pg||
nt|col3435: N/S play "Acol with 5-card majors and a strong NT"|pg||
nt|col3435: E/W card isn't there but I think they play strong+5 too|pg||
nt|sn00py27: Not quite Acol then !|pg||
nt|ady: this wont make    but n/s likely to make 8 tricks in 1NT|pg||
nt|idc: ok, or that gets the job done even more easily :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: the aces will take care of partner's @H+@C losers, however those two cards are split|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cK|nt|col3435: well, yes. Seems like a contradiction in terms to me. But that's what they say.|pg||
nt|steshome: Good play|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: @SJ10 might be useful fillers...@DAK9 is great|pg||
nt|henryb: he did not like that, so he called in his information tech people. wait a moment they said, we will check on the computer|pg||
nt|pkl: Oh - no reason to worry. I bet we'll have eleven tricks in the sack in no time.|pg||
nt|idc: A pity that we didn't get a chance to see if West would find @d lead v3NT, Q best perhaps|pg||
nt|pkl: That is a nice lead ... looks as if i holds N to ten tricks|pg||
pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: understandable that NS are hoping to create some action given the match score. but that 5C bid is infinitely more likely to widen the gap than to close it|pg||
nt|athene: East will be disappointed to get only her top trumps from here|pg||
nt|steshome: I understand that the standing before the last round is Northern Ireland on 76, Scotland on 74 and England on 61|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|sybarra: immediate @D hook |pg||
nt|steshome: Good duck|pg||
nt|bobholl: goo duck i'm sure|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: admittedly you don't want to bid a grand slam when there is a chance they might not reach the small slam in the other room|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, so down two may show a profit, but there are easier ways to make a living|pg||
pc|h8|nt|marlowepi: i am puzzled why N did not respond 2D|pg||
nt|athene: a 6-card minor is shorter than a 5-card major, for most people, these days|pg||
nt|col3435: (it probably just means "not 2/1 GF")|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: i am sorry to say|pg||
nt|eggy: good defence|pg||
nt|henryb: back they came. 4 they said|pg||
nt|lestergold: good start for Catherine|pg||
nt|henryb: he did not like that, so he called in the accountants|pg||
nt|lestergold: east may well be endoplayed more times thanm she likes for her visit to heavan|pg||

nt|Walddk5: hmmm|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: EW would probably get another trick if W continued spades, but that is not too likely|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: but there is more to it than that. 2D has the advantage of announcing strength immediately also|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: i think with all those keycards for diamonds, south should not stop below 6@D after north bids 4@D|pg||

nt|athene: well, i don't know N-S's methods, but i am assuming Acol-ish, so things tend not to be forcing :)|pg||

nt|chessmaste: Not a great line - there was an easy overtrick avalable|pg||
nt|roswolf: a 20/20 hcp hand - how high will e/w go?|pg||
nt|eggy: If S had continued spades from the top, N could have underplayed teh S5 for the same effect of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe it wa purgatory rather than heavan|pg||
nt|mug: I fear we would be infringing some EBU regulation, betting on this event|pg||
nt|steshome: I won't tell anyone if you don't ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Roland would like this - a 20/20 deal|pg||
nt|ady: nice multi|pg||
nt|idc: We should start to see some comparisons coming from the other table soon - specs can open a Movie|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: that is the humnan reality, true, though in international matches one is more or less expected to overcome those foibles|pg||
nt|mamos: i think the hand was played rotated so op had problems  as it seems did the players and commentators|pg||
nt|mugsmate: That sort of multi makes me feel old. Routine when I was at university 15 years ago.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You are lucky, it makes *me* feel sick|pg||
nt|mugsmate: First in at favourable vulnerability is a good time to be a bit random, so long as your partner knows not to punish you.|pg||
nt|ady: if they get the club suit right then 3T will make|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: alerted as weak major, max 7pts|pg||
nt|mugsmate: The multi may be just what is required to protect that club queen.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that Multi may cause declarer not to get clubs right|pg||
nt|ady: Jagger may sacrifice in 4@H|pg||
nt|idc: - bottom right of screen button - and see how the boards play out there|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is not a slam,  e/w in game in major,  sac in @D for n/s?|pg||
nt|mug: although I did take delivery of a box of dubious quality wine yesterday |pg||
nt|bobholl: 4 @H + 1 :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N should not have that worry when S cues 5C|pg||
nt|roswolf: will south fancy this hand?|pg||
nt|sharkirl: 4s |pg||
nt|mug: perhaps your stake would be a Blue Nun Sarah?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would be tempted to bid 2@C over 1@H with East |pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT overcall?|pg||
nt|henryb: over an opening 1@s do you overcall 1N or double and bid 2N|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT for me|pg||
nt|sn00py27: opp passed hand I am happy to settle with 1NT|pg||
nt|henryb: I think I would double and bid 2N actually|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: anyone prefer 2nt instead of 3@D?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|mug: I do|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: a not very bold prediction, Bob :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: east doubled 1@D intending to bid spades next and show a strong hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has announced a strong NT, and six is cold facing both round aces and diamond KQ, which is only 13|pg||
nt|chessmaste: South might protect |pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be finis|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1nt not unreasonable all acions are going to be distorted with this hand|pg||
nt|sn00py27: but I would do something with S - unless they play 2@C as conventional and she has no easy bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1n is the closest|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Just 3H. If you play this random style, you have to play it as a PARTNERSHIP. Jagger can't go to 4H when partner may be so weak.|pg||
nt|ady: 4H could be 500 or 800 |pg||
nt|dburn: trouble is, she still doesn't know which major her partner has|pg||
nt|mug: and I feel 2@H on the North hand was a bit passive|pg||
nt|steshome: Oh for you, a bottle of the finest liebfraumilch.  Actually, I'll take odds of 15-1.  |pg||
pc|c6|nt|mug: any prediction regarding the LM is bold|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: she doesn't really want her next decision to be selecting a lead to 1@DX|pg||
nt|athene: it's a pretty good suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: she appears to|pg||
nt|dburn: if it turns out to be spades, 4@s might even be making|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Interestingly, north has shown 4-4 in the majors and south has shown 5 hearts, so there is no real reason to get the clubs wrong anymore.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but look what it has led to|pg||
nt|mug: so I lose either way Sarah?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@D was about to go two down|pg||
nt|steshome: :) I don't like this effort at catching up|pg||
nt|mug: usual story|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|lestergold: south should bid 2c surely|pg||
pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: i wouldn;t need to be tempted. i would do it before temptation even arose|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i would not like to play the n/s hands at the 3 level but maybe that is why i am commentating these days|pg||
nt|henryb: yes, or double 1N would be my choice|pg||
nt|idc: All roads seem to lead to 3NT making here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Pass can be the hardest bidding card to put on the table|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I don't believe this|pg||
nt|steshome: What on earth is going on?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: hmmm this auction seems illogical|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Enterprising and unlucky to find partner with most of her points in spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the drinks have been spiked|pg||
nt|bobholl: better than no prediction :) ?|pg||
nt|steshome: The previous board was well defended, Tom|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: i assume West in fact didn't pass|pg||
nt|sn00py27: should make 3@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: she has the theoretical values for a double but hand is too top heavy for it for my liking|pg||
nt|mamos: Pass would be a field if partner had psyched|pg||
nt|henryb: partner is third hand at favorable ...|pg||
nt|idc: I guess 6@d is playable but a bit ambitious|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No, it's mainly because you are not a woman|pg||
nt|roswolf: east has saved the opps bacon|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They won't allow you in even if you shave, Geoffrey|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it is probably getting tken out as indeed it was and then u have to show trhis limite dhand at the 3 level|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: either South or West probably bid 1@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you dont want a spade lead from Txxxx or some rubbish against 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: presumably south denied 4 spades by bidding 2nt|pg||
nt|sn00py27: as 8 counts go - it is quite decent|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes has the 2 extra 9's|pg||
nt|lestergold: even more reason to bid a quiet 2 clubs|pg||
nt|mamos: i like 2C because if partner is light you have tolerance for @S and no great harm is done|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate this hand was always likely to finish where it has|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: maybe N simply did the multiplication and made the bid that would complete the equation|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3@H I don't care for|pg||
nt|chessmaste: or 3@S|pg||
nt|sn00py27: me neither, was thinking of passing back to partner or 2NT|pg||
nt|mug: dreadful |pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: well, good old partner found a club lead anyway :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 3@S was very hasty|pg||
nt|col3435: yes it ought to be possible for N/S to scramble to their best fit after the Dbl|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3@S has two chances - slim and none|pg||
nt|col3435: but evidently a confident 3@h has its merits|pg||
nt|lestergold: and its infrangible|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Key moment|pg||
nt|ady: a lot of imps here|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Seems that only if south is exactly 3541 or 2551 does south have a singleton club. There are more shapes where south has 2 clubs.|pg||
nt|pkl: I don't find it obvious that you end in 3NT. 5@D looks also reasonable to me. |pg||
pc|c2|nt|henryb: I prefer impregnable|pg||
nt|pkl: ... or 4@S ;-)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: and 1NT or 2NT is a likely enough rebid for S|pg||
nt|ady: roof falls in|pg||
nt|pkl: Much more interesting than 3NT!|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: definitely not one for the kids, this|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: 2 of @H for the club lead |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: a new one but be careful Henry some of these ladies are quite young |pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: it is not devoid of hope - defence may assist|pg||
nt|rnc: Due to the CC, a direct 2NT would have been xfer to @D - so this will presumably be their way to invite "1NT-2NT"|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: why didn't south rebid 1@S?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: a likely push |pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|henryb: yes, well ...|pg||
nt|pkl: I'd ruff a heart in dummy ....|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mamos: North pleased to have lead .....not|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h8|nt|pkl: ... but this one works better in practive.|pg||

nt|pkl: Now, S is endplayed. That singleton was not such a big asset anyway.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|steshome: Roland dispenses all the commentators with nice pills before the events - but I must say my stock has run out already|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: perhaps still a little shell-shocked from the previous board|pg||

nt|chessmaste: Graham Kirby would never have done that:)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: She did not need any count - East could not have five hearts|pg||

nt|eggy: at least on the 800 hand - Stockdale bid the making game (5D)|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: an awful lot of slams in this set already. what's up with that? a spec asked if this is goulasch LOL|pg||
nt|athene: Multi-2@D; east might try 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb: a bad unbiddable 3N?|pg||
nt|henryb: that happens to make|pg||
nt|ady: a diamond slam for e/w|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Six diamonds by east is a great spot here - the play complicated by the unlucky 3-0 trump break.|pg||
nt|ady: if they get the diamond right|pg||

mb|1H|nt|roswolf: now this could be fun|pg||
mb|d|nt|mamos: 16 +8 will they bid 3NT?|pg||
nt|pkl: A very nice 6@H... should be easy to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: an awful lot of slam bidding, and vice versa :)|pg||
nt|steshome: The hand with @sJxxxx might have doubled 5@S|pg||
mb|2D|nt|marlowepi: looks like the Multi. either that or everybody has a fatal attraction for the 2D card in the bidding box (as did S on the previous hand)|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D is certainly spades but hard to be sure what strength it shows|pg||
nt|athene: there are several schemes for rebids here, and west might be cautiously treating it as minimum or optimistically treating it as maximium|pg||
nt|rnc: And if bid and made twice, it'll be... 800 :)|pg||
nt|dburn: unlucky start to the auction - will now play the wrong way round for the Burn Percentage Play to work|pg||
nt|ady: if south does not lead a club   can make even mis guessing the diamond|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will be a scramble |pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes - but generally auctions like that end in someone doubling, whether the contract can be defeated or not |pg||
nt|bobholl: will they stay of 3NT ? doubt it|pg||
nt|jallerton: I was about to predict 2@d by W here - N changed that by opening|pg||

nt|roswolf: ty|pg||
nt|eggy: If she'd tried 6, she'd have made that too I suppose|pg||
nt|dburn: however, after this start they may reach only 3NT anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: but East has done well|pg||
nt|mug: 3NT is cold isn't it?|pg||
nt|steshome: Agressive opener - Fee knows a big win is needed|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: We don't have a CC for NS so we can try to guess their system as the match developes|pg||
nt|mug: one of the English juniors has just told me how much he appreciates the opportunity BBO gives him and his friends to watch some of the country's top internationals in play|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: i think north could afford to take it a bit slower|pg||
nt|athene: one opponent has passed|pg||
nt|athene: and you have a fair amount in the majors|pg||
nt|eggy: unless West leads a spade|pg||
nt|sn00py27: 1nt - 3NT ?|pg||
nt|henryb: at most 2N|pg||
nt|dburn: West has plenty of extra playing strength, but no really convenient way to show it|pg||
nt|mugsmate: I agree east hass done well, but a byproduct of 3S is that south may well lead a club now.|pg||
nt|idc: My first guess is that they play splinters :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: @CAK @DAK for the defence here, and they don't have to find them right away|pg||
nt|athene: although they do have to be a little bit careful|pg||
nt|lestergold: combined 24 good intermediates 3n a fair shot and it makes comfortably on any lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: i see only signs for pass|pg||
nt|mug: and Stockdale should have bid it |pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, you'll have to take the first @d if that suit is led - wonderful|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and it's game-all - opps aren't at favourable or anything scary like that|pg||
nt|dburn: well, they are in six now|pg||
nt|mug: Capal and Nelson must play an extremely solid overcalling style if these bids are correct|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sn00py27: East's bidding on this hand has worked well|pg||
nt|chessmaste: They have done well - hardly obvious to insist on game facing a weak two in diamonds|pg||
nt|sn00py27: good start|pg||
nt|lestergold: north should go|pg||
nt|dburn: or very shortly|pg||
nt|mug: for me the North hand would be worth 2@D over 2@C, and South would pass 2@H|pg||
pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: well they sort of do, after AK of clubs|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pkl: I believe you are right... and some kind of Blackwood?|pg||

nt|steshome: Where did we get to with that bet by the way, Tom?  |pg||
nt|mug: now I think declarer can get home|pg||
nt|mug: I was just telling you my view of the odds Sarah, I can't be bothered to bet on ladies bridge :)|pg||
nt|mug: prefer more predictable events like horses and dogs|pg||
nt|mug: @DK @CA throwing a spade, @HA, diamond ruff, heart |pg||
nt|mug: losing two hearts and two spades|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|rnc: Yes|pg||
nt|idc: I like North's actions - not quite worth more than 4@h after the splinter in AKQx suit|pg||
nt|pkl: I would have been much weaker bidding 4@D - perhaps it is some "double strength" type of cue|pg||
pc|dK|nt|henryb: look how bad this 3N is: needs both black suits to run and not to lose 4@d and the @sA|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: yes, they do now|pg||
nt|lestergold: its far from throw against wall but i think that its a vulnerable game that should be bid|pg||
nt|bobholl: why not overtaken ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: snap|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dburn: one indication may come if South leads @c10, though - short clubs implies long diamonds|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|athene: could @DA and another ever be wrong?|pg||

pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade intermediates good- dims can b e blocked or notm led when they are 5/3|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would want to be in this game|pg||
nt|henryb: It is about 50% for each black suit. so both is 25%. you have some other chances but not many|pg||
nt|dburn: well, I would go down for sure, but East may draw the right inference|pg||

nt|mug: then bid spades, to show a strong hand with spades|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes, it's a good hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: old fashioned acol 2 (8 playing tricks)|pg||
nt|jallerton: although S may take the view that slam is unlikely when partner is passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: And now West has an interesting problem|pg||
nt|idc: many pairs don't play penalty dbls of strong NT, we will see soon what they play|pg||
nt|mug: yes could just blast 4@S |pg||
nt|mug: very reasonable|pg||
mb|3S|nt|marlowepi: a bit of a grotty overcall at these colors facing passed pd|pg||
nt|athene: i am vaguely aware there was such a person :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: possibly more than one...|pg||
nt|col3435: straight to 4@s now?|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet W blasts into it |pg||
nt|sybarra: and she did |pg||

mb|p|nt|idc: CC says dbl= minors v strong nt|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: chunky 2@H bid|pg||
nt|steshome: Would you double in preference to overcalling 1@S?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pkl: 2@C both majors. And that D made it somewhat easier from EW, I believe|pg||
nt|idc: 2@c is majors & 2@d single suited major|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H here would normally be pre-emptive |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S certainly wouldn't have been easy|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good morning to Andrew Webb from Australia|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: TD called; instead of opening lead she put hand down as dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Oh dear, 13 penalty cards|pg||
nt|tejjyid: must be earlyin the AM|pg||
nt|tejjyid: before the 1st cup of coffee|pg||
nt|Walddk7: If all cards are exposed, they are all penalty cards|pg||
nt|Walddk7: And declarer can choose in which order they should be played|pg||
nt|tejjyid: contract should make then...|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: Laughter all round|pg||
nt|Walddk7: @CK lead would be a good start for declarer, so she will likely to choose that card|pg||
nt|tejjyid: @C K lead, followed by @HK |pg||
nt|tejjyid: then pitch all the @S |pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: Gordon having difficulty finding this in his book|pg||
nt|marlowepi: an unusual type of double dummy problem|pg||
nt|marlowepi: declarer cursing her luck "why doesnt this ever happen when we bid a dicey slam???"|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: We're skipping this awaiting a decision|pg||
nt|eggy: a bit wet that pass|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   inlikely to get into the auction    looks like 2@S  n/s|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@h would not be among my choices on that suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: that is tracy's style|pg||
nt|dburn: a couple of small swings to England in the first three boards - they might have been larger, but ...|pg||
nt|idc: East's 2@d here is no doubt equal length in majors - at least I hope it is :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: (glad p brought some @H's) |pg||
nt|steshome: Good view to save on the West hand |pg||
nt|jallerton: Nice save founf by Jean Hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: North passed - we have some sound bidders on VuGraph today |pg||
nt|roswolf: will the rabbi'c rule be applied?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: this is the 13 penalty card hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: rabbi's|pg||
nt|chessmaste: he's not playing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but maybe NS play differently|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: south did indeed open 2@C on the 4@S-7@H hand and duly reached slam|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room|pg||
nt|tejjyid: played without penaly, apparently|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room, north led a heart|pg||
nt|athene: i would certainly prefer a spade from those two suits|pg||
nt|marlowepi: which at llong last i understand. this event is the Home Internationals, and most  accidents  happen at home|pg||
nt|athene: then declarer played @CA and viewed to duck on the next round|pg||
nt|mug: I would bid 1@S but can understand double|pg||

nt|ady: 2@D shows a weak hand with a 2nd suit of hearts   an immediate 2@H  would be stronger|pg||
nt|idc: and 4@h is guessing that 2@d shows some values, though I don't see why it should|pg||
nt|idc: well, I don't like the bidding much but it has got them to a perfectly playable spot|pg||

pc|s2|nt|petepunt:  looks lie 9 tricks with care|pg||
nt|athene: the @H9 comes down|pg||
nt|athene: so you don't need to ruff any hearts|pg||
nt|eggy: unlike the 3S opener, - even at this vul|pg||

nt|idc: don't leave me alone for too long Peter - it wouldn't be fair on the specs for one thing!|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petepunt:  can cross ruff high anyway|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: could make ten tricks perhaps by a loser-on-loser? lead @DJ, throw club on it|pg||
nt|eggy: still - it shouldn't be too taxing to defend|pg||
nt|idc: as long as declarer keeps trumps control tight, it should be making|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: then throw another club on the @D10?|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you bid with the E hand, Henry?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|chessmaste: See|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: it might be hard to organise the drawing of trumps in the middle of all this i suppose|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
nt|pkl: There are 34 specs. Do they all know you, Ian? ;-)|pg||
nt|henryb: you have to bid, since you are short in @s, but I think 3@h is begging for trouble|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rnc: oops|pg||
pc|h4|nt|idc: obviously not, or there would be 34 fewer :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pkl: *LOL*|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|eggy: oh dear - as John Holland told me just now ..|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pkl: I did not quite get that heart play.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mugsmate: With that big heart holding, a trump lead at trick one was certainly tempting.|pg||
nt|henryb: I would X and hope not to miss a 5-3 @h fit|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|sn00py27: they had to play K@S I think to avoid squeeze|pg||
nt|eggy: I sadi that about the defence a few moments ago and was proved wrong :(|pg||

pc|c3|nt|Walddk4: 2-1 to Scotland as far as commentators are concerned. Welcome to Jim Hay|pg||

nt|tejjyid: well, maybe North won't open that hand next time|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes "very comfortable" contracts just don;t fetch|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Aggressive bidding is a good tactic if your declarer play has the gift of squeezing the extra trick out of things|pg||
nt|chessmaste: This might be interesting|pg||
nt|eggy: as the natural think would be to take the losing spade view|pg||
nt|mamos: next case|pg||
nt|dburn: well defended, though - a fine opening lead|pg||
nt|ahh: yes that is a  euphemism for something else |pg||
nt|idc: I think I have a line like that in my references:|pg||
nt|idc: His capacity for prolonged periods of thoughful reflection in the afternoon will amaze you|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well played|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: yes|pg||
nt|jallerton: but that relies on keeping your 1 of a minor openers fairly sound|pg||
nt|mug: ahem|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: and if north bids spades enthusiastically, that can only help west|pg||
nt|athene: variable NT for N-S|pg||
nt|col3435: is West worth a double of 1@h, do you think?|pg||
nt|eggy: and get a club switch|pg||
nt|jallerton: We saw Fiona open a random 10-count earlier|pg||
nt|mug: not in the Kokish playbook|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt:  1@S will do here|pg||
nt|lestergold: that case is best forgotten quickly Mike|pg||
nt|mamos: might even be passed out|pg||
nt|henryb: E-W have more high cards but no suits and no tricks; N-S have suits but no fit|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you also bid 1@D 1@H 2@H with ax hxxx qjxxx Qx than it is difficult :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: not a hand for anyone to make anything|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Not for me - and it will give the game away here |pg||
nt|pkl: Can you hear the snore? ;-)|pg||
nt|mug: many pairs play 2@C Drury by a passed hand, to show about 9-11 with a fit|pg||
nt|mug: very useful convention, saves getting too high when partner has opened a bit light |pg||
nt|steshome: 6 imps to wales on board 3.  Funny board|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: Drury is a bit of a Marmite convention I have found|pg||
nt|mug: 2@D is a dangerous bid but all in a day's work I think, practically routine|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes I agree with AKQxx|pg||
nt|jallerton: Should East have raised?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: west of course doesn't expect that her partner has so little wasted in spades|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt would have worked out fine as well, even though they are off the club suit|pg||
nt|ady: can make 2@H  |pg||
nt|steshome: This is a fit-jump presumably |pg||
nt|mug: and how would you describe 3@D Steve?|pg||
nt|mug: I think not|pg||
nt|bobholl: then 4@S would have been easy now i don't know|pg||
mb|2S|nt|diumraid: Current in Running Scores are as follows  N-IRELAND  19,  ENGLAND  16,   IRELAND  16,  SCOTLAND 14, CBAI 14, WALES  11|pg||
nt|col3435: a spade lead might also give the game away|pg||
nt|sybarra: can probably get coffee,   |pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt:  3@S was possible with 2 aces,  but a bit thin for a slam try|pg||
nt|chessmaste: West will have an awkward lead against 4@H|pg||
nt|sn00py27: very dangerous with 4333|pg||
nt|mamos: are NS too high already?|pg||
nt|lestergold: that case may end up with fornsic investigators in the cold case files|pg||
nt|henryb: the club lead will give away one trick, and eventually declarer will lead to the @hK for a seventh|pg||
nt|jallerton: A good hand for Lebensohl|pg||
nt|mug: too often just leads to a hopeless 3NT when partner is strong|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@c shows values from North else 2NT|pg||
nt|mug: yes this is one of only two positions in which I currently play 2NT Lebensohl|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  SCOTLAND 92, N-IRELAND 90, ENGLAND 79, CBAI 70, IRELAND 70, WALES 45 ****|pg||
nt|steshome: It might be a lebensohl position for them|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: they will play 4@S now and just lose @H @C @C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this deal looks like a 2-bid auction to me|pg||
nt|ahh: my friend Jules suggests its all part of a cunning plan  if you wait 5 mins before bidding or play the (lady ) opps begin mentally writing shopping lists  and before you all ...|pg||
nt|ahh: complain about sexism Jules (very nice LADY ) says is it gameswomanship |pg||
nt|idc: Peter and I are too afraid to comment|pg||
nt|ahh: when i am the victim i begin to think about important things like beer and football |pg||
nt|pkl: I would say that statement of Jim was a most sexist one...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sn00py27: I wd probably fish out the 4 @S - not a success here |pg||
nt|lestergold: well maybe they are but they havent done anything wrong yet|pg||
nt|dburn: or beat 1NT a trick - not perhaps altogether wise for South to volunteer to play the hand rather than defend it|pg||
nt|ahh: coward |pg||
nt|pkl: ... but for the fact that it is probably true ;-)|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: a fit jump - i'm guessing|pg||
nt|jallerton: what's the other?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|col3435: I'd have the @s4 on the table in a flash, and declarer would be very grateful|pg||
nt|sn00py27: not sure our support for the lead will make West feel any better !|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In one sense North did well not to respond 1@S  |pg||
nt|mug: some care required in the play|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: doesnt really describe the hand that well though|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: this looks safe enough - time for a quick cuppa|pg||
nt|dburn: but whether South or West bid 1NT, East was going to venture 2@h anyway|pg||
nt|idc: I was expecting a pass there, but EW seem determined not to miss any games|pg||
nt|bobholl: the other one as answer on weak 2 double ?:)|pg||
nt|mug: facing double of two-level pre-empt |pg||
mb|4S|nt|petepunt:  predict 13?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: with the NOrth cards opposite a 15-17 NT, 3NTdirectly is tempting|pg||
nt|jallerton: Must be Lebensohl to explain the jump to 4@s|pg||
nt|mug: so I think well bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: what does 2c mean?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 2d?|pg||
nt|sn00py27: puppet to 2@D which you can pass if weak with @D|pg||
nt|henryb: transfer to 2@d; start of possibly invitational sequences|pg||
nt|mamos: i think this is a good piece of convention but not sure Souths hand is suitable|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah hah|pg||
nt|sn00py27: or make invitational bids - 2@D over 1NT would be GF|pg||
nt|mamos: gladiator|pg||
nt|lestergold: but what is wrong with 1n soutgh is not weak|pg||
mb|5C|nt|henryb: by a passed hand perhaps not the best use of the bids|pg||
nt|idc: they may miss some plus scores in partscore, but no games|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: they may go minus a lot too |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 1n struggles mainly because of bad break in dimaonds! |pg||
mb|p|nt|asnuttyas: 1 @C ruff wont harm declarer - it's with her natural trump trick|pg||
nt|mug: ducking a spade looks natural but there is a danger of walking into a defensive cross-ruff|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: certainly 13 now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eggy: not Mike Lawrences view though|pg||
nt|steshome: Ferdinand's penalty saved ...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: by which same token 8 tricks in diamonds becomes a tall order|pg||
nt|pkl: A tough lady, Mrs. Punch... |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|idc: mind you, on this layout and lead they have some play|pg||
nt|mug: ok now @HAK to stop any nonsense|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chessmaste: In some book I suggested a lead from a king was very dangerous - and a trump was also bad - plus underleading an ace was out of the question|pg||
nt|ahh: i can see 8  wheres theres 8 a 9th may appear |pg||
pc|c4|nt|sn00py27: maybe in pairs ok, but too dangerous for me at imps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and here it comes, I suspect|pg||
nt|steshome: Oh dear|pg||
pc|h5|nt|idc: good switch from North|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade switch neede to cut off heart trick|pg||
nt|henryb: much as I love aces, I might not open the N hand|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: now what  ace and @C ? |pg||
nt|sybarra: or H!?|pg||
nt|sybarra: *@H?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or J of @D?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sybarra: all possible, I gues it took me a while |pg||
pc|d3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mug: nonsense a-plenty I'm afraid|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s3|pc|h8|nt|idc: Oh, forgot about the 2@c overcall - still well done to her anyway|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: Henry with the greatest respect failure tio open a hand containing 3 aces is a hanging offence in these parts|pg||
nt|dburn: but declarer is giving herself plenty to do here, though she will probably survive|pg||
pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: sometimes it is good to use conventions in close decisions, as it keeps you from forgetting them|pg||
nt|eggy: I think there is ahand where you get this auction and x with 4(@S)333 ..|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: only one spade ruff needed for ten tricks, so this has to go down as a misplay|pg||
nt|mug: good defence but declarer did not give the hand sufficient thought|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes, careless mistake|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahh: might as well pressure south before playing @S|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: of course if you are worried partner is on the point of forgetting them, you have a knife-edge decision|pg||
nt|tejjyid: also if u r tired & emotional, process may be better than judgement|pg||

nt|roswolf: this might produce a tilt at gamee by n/s|pg||

nt|lestergold: plus bullets are quite helpful if pard has an aceless hand with a long suit|pg||
nt|ady: think A@S was wrong    let the king get ruffed that way|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Had declarer ruffed a diamond after taking the two diamond tricks the defense couldn't have timed this spade ruff & trump promotion.|pg||

nt|ahh: i guess 4@C unless its artificial |pg||
nt|pkl: Very difficult hand W... could be inclined to bid 5@C|pg||

nt|sybarra: 1 nt by W?  or too good (they might play wk nt)|pg||

nt|idc: time to raise with a void for East - but to how many :)|pg||
nt|ahh: if you have played with sam before you bid 5 and hope you have enough for it to make|pg||
nt|idc: A 5@c opening would have been interesting - raising to 6@c would have been possible then?|pg||
nt|pkl: I believe there are thirteen tricks in a spade-contract|pg||
nt|henryb: I think that is within range|pg||
nt|sybarra: so in their range |pg||
nt|sharkirl: trouble here?|pg||
nt|henryb: North will bid. the question is what|pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks like trouble for either side |pg||
nt|mug: every time this pair has played this weekend I have the feeling they are overwhelming the opposition|pg||
nt|mug: but it never seems to be reflected in the scoreline|pg||
mb|2C|an|4+M - 4+m|nt|roswolf: 6@D might well be on here|pg||
mb|2H|an|4+ !S|nt|athene: 4@H or 3NT  good for E-W here but not trivial to reach|pg||
nt|petepunt:  west worth a raise  to 3@Hat some stage|pg||
nt|eggy: My copy ofhis book seems to have gone AWOL, so I am afraid I can't reference it|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@h probably = @h and a minor|pg||
nt|sybarra: if 2 @H is @h and minor,  S may bid 2 nt for the minor |pg||
nt|henryb: we will know shortly|pg||
nt|sybarra: "systems on" over interference or ???|pg||
nt|sybarra: I.e.,  being able to ask for minor?|pg||
nt|henryb: not over 2@h. not sensible|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is 3 @C pass or correct?  (which I doubt) |pg||
nt|henryb: might be|pg||
nt|jallerton: which pair?|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: but was it well defended?|pg||
mb|2S|an|stops !H|nt|athene: 3nt just needs 4-3 spades or no spade lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: aha|pg||
nt|sharkirl: very flat match so far, all but 1 a push|pg||
nt|mug: Brown-Stockdale, they always seems to have a nice row of plus-scores|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: we have an extra pass in here, operator|pg||
nt|athene: need undo|pg||
nt|ahh: live by the sword  die by it |pg||
nt|pkl: Yes - I would open 5@C and raise to 6. Unless I saw both hands at once|pg||
nt|ahh: 6 is a reasonable bid in isolation |pg||
mb|3C|an|5!S-3-3-2 or 5!S+ - 4!D+|nt|roswolf: the barrage will make things difficult|pg||
nt|pkl: 6C could win, I believe?|pg||
nt|idc: in isolation from the actual auction?   B->|pg||
nt|ahh: some bizarre trump reduction coup thingy |pg||
nt|pkl: Just ruff a lot of cards ... I believe the incomes are there|pg||
nt|idc: You guys are right I believe|pg||
nt|ahh: the only alternative is to play for singleton @C honour or KQ stiff|pg||
nt|idc: but hard for declarer not to just rely on single honour|pg||
nt|ahh: so west may find it |pg||
nt|pkl: Right. But I admit a lot of stuff would have to go well with the trump-reduction plan as well |pg||
nt|pkl: ... and it requires a little help from opps (the @D lead)|pg||
nt|ahh: ok  so you open 4@C  what does 4nt mean ?  what does 4@S mean    have you discussed them  does anybody ?|pg||
nt|ahh: 1 should ask for trump quality |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H or 3@H?|pg||
nt|steshome: The bridge now is of a different quality - the girls are playing really well and very determined|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: well, this is fair enough|pg||
nt|mug: 2@H was fine, the diamond honours don't rate to be good cards|pg||
nt|mug: 3@S looks like an overbid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H presumably a high-card raise to 3@S|pg||
mb|4D|an|4+!D 3!S,  bad cards|nt|marlowepi: many pairs have ways to distinguish a good 2H raise from a nuisance raise over doublke|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H might be a much weaker hand - it would be useful to have 2@D available as a good 3-card raise|pg||
nt|petepunt:  2@d best used as a 8-10 3 card raise|pg||
nt|tejjyid: My least favourite standard auction|pg||
nt|tejjyid: SOuth's pass is very conservative |pg||
nt|athene: i wouldn't be happy as south about never showing the most important feature of my hand - my spade fit|pg||
nt|eggy: 4@S is doubled on 21 in the closed|pg||
nt|henryb: East would have done better to switch to a @s after cashing her club, but ...|pg||
nt|pkl: For me 4NT natural, 4S cue. No way to end in a major after the preempt.|pg||
nt|henryb: I would play 3@c = @c and 2N = what minor|pg||
nt|sybarra: wasnt sure you would play that over interference,  but makes more sense than bidding 2 nt |pg||
nt|sharkirl: me too Henry|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was my first instinct also Henry |pg||

nt|sybarra: so they much have a meaning for 2 nt |pg||
nt|henryb: both majors lie well for declarer, so probably will make even with a trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: North might still have a 6 card @S suit|pg||

nt|lestergold: what i think i said at the time|pg||
nt|sn00py27: if 2@H GF, wonder why not a splinter with W|pg||
nt|lestergold: in any case this does not look like a hand likely to ive rise to any embarrasin post mortems|pg||
nt|ady: looks like win and try a heart switch    east should p lay the clubs to guard against 4-0 when the heart finesse wins|pg||
mb|4N|nt|petepunt:  when playing 5 card majors and strong nt after x|pg||
nt|athene: the way the bidding went, west might have taken a view and bid game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S seems quite s stretch to these timid eyes :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3NT has little chance on a spade lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: that may well be an overbid but it should work|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, 3@S looks very aggressive|pg||

mb|5S|an|2KC and Q over 6KCs|nt|rnc: Seems to reach it now...or at least on their way|pg||

mb|p|nt|petepunt:  a good "save" here|pg||
nt|steshome: Umm, I'd have doubled|pg||
mb|6D|nt|athene: if you are going to use those spades for ruffing hearts, you can't count the 8 hcp for AKJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if W shows a good raise, E is worth at least a game invitation|pg||
nt|petepunt:  Lizcummins struggles with the concept of the pass card :)|pg||
nt|henryb: 2N is probably a game-interested hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: club to ace now|pg||
nt|idc: so you bid suit below the one you need a control in|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: looks to be at least 2 off|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they needed to double 6@D, given what happened at the other table - 3@Hx= for 530|pg||
nt|mug: declarer's going to find the spades anyway after the double of 1@D|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes, a curious gain for Wales|pg||
nt|mug: and with respect to the Welsh East, it's not like Meckstroth is at the helm|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West is declarer|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: nice|pg||
nt|rnc: Well done!|pg||

nt|athene: you might survive a misguess in trumps if you can get diamonds going for a spade pitch|pg||

nt|vugraphzmr: sry - defence not quite on the right wavelength and made 9 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: that hand will leave a few scars on north|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: another coffee break hand we need a couple of these after the recent excitmenet|pg||
nt|henryb: a trivial 4@h for N-S|pg||
nt|dburn: a couple more small swings to England when 3NT went one down rather than three, and 3@h made where 2@h failed in this room|pg||
nt|henryb: another partscore hand|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: forgot to unblock the @D8 to win the beer card - poor show|pg||

nt|tejjyid: this is a similar hand - Mighjt go 1@H -2 @D ; 2@H all pass|pg||
nt|athene: well 1@D will certainly get them there!|pg||
nt|mamos: Making 2@D was worth 7 imps to England as 1NT went 2 off|pg||
nt|dburn: but they add up to a useful lead for England, who could do with a win if they are to challenge for the Lady Milne trophy|pg||
nt|ahh: transfer anti cue bids   whatever next  bidding 2@C after 1nt to ask for majors  i ask you |pg||
nt|pkl: That 3NT on last deal gave scotland 10 imps|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1 or 4?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: OK, not any more|pg||
nt|idc: Scotland gained 10 IMPs on Bd 7, but that last board may see the lead only temporary|pg||
nt|mdgraham: tactical 1NT|pg||
mb|2D|an|4!H|nt|marlowepi: not that it is likely with 3 in each major and a mediocre suit and adverse colors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, that is the easiest way to survive a misguess in trumps....stay low:)|pg||
nt|athene: really 4@H? or are we just skipping to the final contract?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: safety play against wimping out later|pg||
nt|sn00py27: i would prefer 3@D by south or 4.....|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@D DOES SEEM RIGHT|pg||

mb|2S|nt|jallerton: They don't play Benjy|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i expected 1@D to silence West :) but she was not so easily silenced!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrth thinks 4@H is fit showing|pg||
nt|athene: responding 4@H at your first turn with that south hand expresses doubt as to partner's constructive bidding, i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: south's off shape double may complicate matters for everyone|pg||
nt|henryb: in my book 2@c is natural, nf and not particularly encouraging|pg||
nt|sn00py27: assuming it would be natural |pg||
nt|roswolf: another poor decision except tracy seems to have jumped into the fire|pg||
nt|eggy: That seems a bit premature surely!|pg||
nt|roswolf: why bid?|pg||
nt|eggy: why poor?|pg||
nt|henryb: South really passed 1N?!|pg||
nt|henryb: that is wild|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: Madden doesnt sound like an Italian name|pg||
nt|tejjyid: We need the WWF to step in and save the Wales|pg||

nt|athene: even if 4@H were fit-showing, surely you pass with @HKxx?|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Red save in 4S one off against 4H here due to the side fit in diamonds. In practise no-one could come in, let alone diagnose the double fit.|pg||
nt|henryb: N-S are actually cold for 3N|pg||
nt|mug: West had too much playing strength to pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW can make 3NT and they might never get into the auction |pg||
nt|mug: 2@H or 2@S was required|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 @H better IMO @S fit will be missed if you open 2@C|pg||
nt|mug: and before you ask, I don't play Reverse Benjy either|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: more likely north was scared it was a splinter?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she thought splinter|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 2@C non forcing is popular - but not with Acol players:)|pg||
nt|col3435: yes this 2@c is an Acoly bid|pg||
nt|col3435: E/W aren't playing Acol but I expect that is the influence here|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: about to bid 3NT - shakes head and changes mind|pg||
nt|eggy: 5@Dx looks to be the par spot|pg||
nt|roswolf: north has been affected i think by the result on the previous hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: well n/s may beat par|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that sounds protective|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahh: and beating it |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: a very useful dummy. it is easy to construct one on which 4@h has no play|pg||
nt|pkl: Operator problem... 3NT north|pg||
nt|ahh: undo |pg||
nt|steshome: I hear on the grapevine that Brown/Stockdale currently top of the butler - dunno if that's right but they're certainly playing very nicely here|pg||
nt|mug: I think 1@H was best|pg||
nt|jallerton: I'm not sure that the Butler is particularly relevant, Sarah.  It is a teams event.|pg||
nt|mug: best to start hearts from the top here, in case of singleton king offisde|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you score well in the butler yuo normally score also well as a team :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: what is E worth if W can't double 1D but did anyway? most systems don;t cover that :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3@H will endplay partner - why not 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: lead holds it to 4 |pg||
nt|idc: defending 3nt would be too easy for NS :)|pg||
nt|steshome: England ahead now as E/W found their save on board 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: but my book recommends transfers after the opponent's to doubles as an alternative|pg||
nt|ahh: @S lead 4 rounds @C next |pg||
nt|idc: those @d in dummy should give a clue to correct defence|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: so would atrump lead|pg||
nt|ahh: that @C in dummy should |pg||
nt|ahh: she is teasing us  will find this   just very slowly|pg||
nt|idc: I suspect I might get to 4@h on these cards, and that isn't a success either|pg||
nt|idc: I think I'd push to bid 2@h over the 1@s overcall as a passed hand|pg||
pc|s9|nt|tejjyid: Even with 13 penalty cards, this would be a tough hand to make|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Good method|pg||
nt|sn00py27: that is what I play, but you miss out on playing 1NT sometimes :(|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may not turn out badly|pg||
pc|sT|nt|roswolf: NS had better play 3 rounds of spades or it might make|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: in regard to an earlier comment, the Italian Blue Team was famous for the success of their off-shape takeout doubl;es|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|bobholl: can be down now after 2@D @S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: N's eyes may fall out on the next round of diamonds when she sees who fails|pg||
nt|chessmaste: well, the same one down as 3NT (assuming a diamond lead)|pg||
nt|col3435: I can't see how you can overcome the spade split here|pg||
pc|d8|nt|henryb: not badly as in DOIGB (Down One Is Good Bridge) :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: strange |pg||
nt|mdgraham: not really a save, as it wasn't doubled|pg||
pc|dT|nt|idc: and South would supoort hearts at some stage - maybe 5@d is still possible but tough|pg||
nt|pkl: So noone finds 5@D? The easiest contract to play, certainly ;-)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: statistically, the odds favor this not being the first time the potential ambiguity of this auction has come up. in that case S might have reflected that a response of 1H--however ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pedestrian--would go a long way towards getting partner to pass over an eventual 4H|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|henryb: why are we playing?|pg||
nt|mug: not on this hand no, I wasn't even looking at the EW hands|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chessmaste: On Board 7 North did bid spades so West led a club - game swing to CBAI|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: yes, no X of 4@S though|pg||

nt|idc: only 2 IMPs in it|pg||
nt|pkl: ... but opening 3@C on last deal is .... |pg||
nt|jallerton: which is more likely?  5-1 spades and @hKxx with E; or precisely stiff @hK with West?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: The dragon team are off the schneid (scored their first IMP)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OK, there may have been other errors int eh128 boards, but that looks like the preventable one|pg||
nt|sybarra: Ireland probably needed that game |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, the pass off @DQxxx @CAKQ10xx worked out a treat|pg||
nt|lestergold: again a pretty easy 4h this time for e/w|pg||
nt|mug: but you also have stiff spade with the doubleton trump|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: when the defence could run nine minor-suit tricks against 1NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Mercy ruling|pg||
nt|athene: E-W might be in trouble here|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D is natural?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe 2 suited?|pg||
nt|athene: it might be diamonds + higher - that's a common form of run-out after 1nt x|pg||
nt|athene: south now waits hopefully for the takeout-double|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I doubt SOuth has much hope left|pg||
nt|roswolf: england need to pull their socks up and score some imps otherwise they will lose this match badly|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: the bad news of the4/1 trump break balancede by the favourable position of the spade K|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south might now bid 4@S, putting her partner with 55 majors|pg||
nt|athene: and being worried about clubs in 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s should play in 5@D quite easily|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: would rather open 1@d and rebid 3@C  |pg||

pc|s7|nt|athene: 3@C is aggressive here|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S is reasonable enough...she has shown her hand by doubling i guess|pg||
nt|athene: but of course there are all sort of subtle misunderstandings possible here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I feel 3@S usually has 5|pg||
nt|mug: close|pg||
nt|jallerton: W might have preferred 3@c to keep other options in the picture|pg||
nt|bobholl: no room to find 44 @S :)|pg||
nt|steshome: That 3NT bid cramps the auction|pg||
nt|mug: so 4@C Stayman perhaps?|pg||
mc|12|nt|athene: assuming it's "standard"; i.e. game-forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this N hand looks a lot more like an overcall than did the S hand on   5|pg||
nt|henryb: On the lead of the @d3 a case can be made for playing low from dummy: North has only one higher card and S might have led high from many holdings including AK|pg||

nt|mdgraham: declarer took @HA but not @HK and suffered the same defensive cross-ruff|pg||

nt|dburn: not easy for them after South opened that fine specimen|pg||

nt|mugsmate: If she did have I suspect she'd have done it by now.|pg||
nt|ahh: now 4@H ?|pg||
nt|mug: and 2@S showed?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south can't be very happy about 4@S getting passed out|pg||
nt|rnc: and might even pick some badly needed on 24|pg||
nt|henryb: no: a renege = failure to follow suit. a renege can be corrected if found before the side has played to the next trick|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: now she knows it was right to bid on|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@s = 4-card suppport |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: East did well not to get over-excited - she does have quite a lot of HCP for a simple overcall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: really? she opened a rag. maybe all she lost is diff between 50 & 100 while anything by NS going for 300|pg||
nt|lestergold: but if i was openng i would still open a heart|pg||
nt|sn00py27: i like to show where I can take tricks and clubs are not going to be very fruitful :)|pg||
nt|ahh: superb |pg||
nt|pkl: 4@H is a very nice contract, and not an obvious one to reach|pg||
nt|ahh: see i can be nice  2 hands in a row as well |pg||
nt|idc: but for how long will that drain your milk of human kindness Jim?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S makes as the cards lie but that's very lucky|pg||
nt|eggy: true - could be 14 if NS bid 6D|pg||
nt|ady: some would dbl 1NT with west's hand  though not safe from a weak hand with east|pg||
nt|mug: by the standards of this event, it was a difficult contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i love the understatement|pg||
nt|henryb: a revoke is after the reneger's side has played to the next trick|pg||

nt|mug: but declarer will still lose two hearts, a diamond and a spade|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't think will make despite the helpfull lead :(|pg||
pc|h8|nt|roswolf: why not a cuebid from west?|pg||
nt|henryb: surely W should bid 6@d with all those controls, not 5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eggy: but should lose on the ill-judged 5@H hand|pg||
nt|sn00py27: they are playing 5CM, that's why I said Mike :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: and indeed the opening bid have cost the defence a trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: as predicted|pg||
nt|mug: it's a long way short of Ladies European Championship standard, but still good practice for those involved|pg||
pc|h5|nt|steshome: Yes, I agree with that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@C seems rather pushy|pg||
nt|mug: 5@C I was about to say was a good bid|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: well it would be hard for E-W to double 5@C or 5@H i think|pg||
nt|athene: as the cards lie|pg||
nt|col3435: maybe unsure about which suit a cue-bid would be agreeing|pg||
nt|sn00py27: maybe she is thinking minimum, but with so many controls this is better|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 5@D very strange|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: yp east did well to bid 6 in the end|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: if the defence led trumps to stop a diamond ruff, declarer could just ruff the clubs good with the @DA as entry|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C was an alternative for West, over the double|pg||
nt|rnc: Even in game it will be 11 imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: this does not look favorite|pg||
pc|c2|nt|eggy: good lead|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i thought we were talking about S's reaction to the passout, before she knows the layout|pg||
nt|chessmaste: She was facing 20-22|pg||
nt|pkl: Would any of you have bid 3@D with the S hand? I would|pg||
nt|ahh: am i allowed to say east bid like a Guy ?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|mug: West appreciated the value of her cards|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rnc: Needs quite a lot of mistakes by defense for letting this thru|pg||
nt|ady: not so easy for west to p  lay the queen   though cost nothing play having the 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could be down a bunch |pg||
nt|jallerton: Looks like the normal thing to do; just wrong double dummy|pg||
nt|jallerton: now needs an unlikely partial elimination against West|pg||
nt|bobholl: T of @H wrong :(|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: yes true but south still can't be that happy surely|pg||
pc|c3|nt|eggy: looks like only 9 on board 24 as CBAI are in 3@Sx|pg||
nt|roswolf: they wont be that generous|pg||
nt|rnc: and not likely|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mug: facing a black two-suiter|pg||
nt|mug: the only problem was that partner actually had a load of old tat|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps 4@C would have catered for that|pg||
pc|s4|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|eggy: not being very helpful at all in fact|pg||
nt|steshome: Or too many values in the red cards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. perhaps 2@S could have held a bit more. Partnership style |pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree with 5@c, though. Influenced by the East hand |pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: seemed to have lost the club ruffs|pg||
nt|steshome: It doesn't make any difference|pg||
nt|jallerton: needs W to have @dKJ10 and @h10xx|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d7|pc|h4|pc|sK|pg||
nt|col3435: I suspect East was going to slam whatever happened. Finding diamond support is just a nice bonus.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|steshome: Not sure W needs the @D10, but need the heart position switched|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|henryb: perhaps the failure to cue either balck suit should promise neither or both controls|pg||

nt|steshome: Spades are 3-3 - easy make here|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps East's clubs were rebiddable?|pg||
nt|jallerton: If the defence switch to @c?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|idc: West can have QJTxxx clubs and nothing else, 3@h seems a little forward|pg||
nt|idc: or even JTxxx clubs and nothing else|pg||
nt|ahh: i have other words for 3@H    they have something to do with canine |pg||
nt|idc: stikll, you have to admit this is fun|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: can she set up a long heart to make this?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S is worth another call, i think--N could have:  xxx  Qxxxxx  KQx   x. i would double 3C to show extras|pg||
nt|athene: south has to attack dummy's entries|pg||
nt|athene: to prevent declarer ruffing the hearts good and getting back to them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and above all (still on the last hand), if S had stiff spade king, wouldnt she have at least thought a long time about playing three rounds of clubs, since pd could uppercut ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dummy's ace if N had spade ten or jack?|pg||
nt|eggy: Did well I think, to heed the gypsy's warning - I can't imagine Tracy passing 2S|pg||
nt|henryb: makes 4 without an immediate @d shift|pg||
nt|sn00py27: dummy must have been a welcome sight|pg||
nt|mdgraham: should be an easy make|pg||
nt|jallerton: alternatively there is the threat of a trump promotion|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 rounds of @D kills the contract :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|henryb: makes 4 without an immediate @d shift|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|idc: if the specs had to watch our auctions, they would be bored|pg||
nt|ahh: last 5 boards double figure swings  this could be more of the same |pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahh: nice hand partner wheres the 1 you held in the bidding ?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: no further interest pray for fast claim before we all fall asleep|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chessmaste: Marvellous|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahh:  nice try |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: no!|pg||
nt|idc: On Bd 11, Scotland found 5@d sacrifice, pushing Ireland to 5@h -1, so 11 IMPs to Scotland|pg||
nt|ahh: ? 5 is stiff must be a mistake |pg||

nt|ahh: just lose 2 aces |pg||
nt|idc: restricted choice situation in trumps, declarer got ti wrong|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: now declarer draws trumps and plays a heart, if she reads the cards correctly|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tejjyid: the clues were there...|pg||
nt|lestergold: zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz|pg||
nt|sn00py27: board 11 got opened a weak NT at other table and got them -500 for the trouble|pg||
nt|ady: this has the feling of down 2 |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: gotta duck that @CQ :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: south can play a diamond but declarer just ducks|pg||
nt|athene: wins the next diamond, ruffs @H, leads spade up|pg||
nt|athene: and south is out of diamonds|pg||
nt|eggy: Although she might make 9 tricks I suppose|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahh: a little nowledge is a dangerous thing |pg||
nt|idc: possibly a case for getting it right, since if hearts were 3-1, opps would be making 5@d|pg||

pc|c2|nt|mugsmate: Attacking dummy's entries to stop declarer eloping with small trumps is good defense.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will be a bit worried in case spades are 4-1 |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|idc: You're a ploner?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|idc: but I'm probably being picky, when you have a chance for your own game, play the odds|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahh: my eyboard has no   ah  that  doesnt wor|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|athene: the trump switch at trick 2 was unlikely to help, but south just wanted to play safely, i imagine|pg||
nt|ady: better to have ruffed a club then|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: even if declarer led a club from hand to the @CQ you should probably duck with east|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: but surely @SA and @SQ was safe?|pg||
nt|athene: and when she leads the @CQ, advertising great strength in the suit, it's more clear|pg||
nt|tejjyid: after 1@D - !NT, the NT bidder usually has @C length|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but everything breaks|pg||
nt|bobholl: no 6 off @S please|pg||
nt|jallerton: Is this obvious?|pg||
nt|bobholl: J of @S is not only in practice better|pg||
nt|jallerton: Could partner have @hJ not @sQ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, I agree @sJ isthe card|pg||
nt|jallerton: to cater for both|pg||
nt|bobholl: good in both cases |pg||
