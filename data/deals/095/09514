nt|athene: this board might get passed out?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, though W might open|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and S might in 3rd seat|pg||

mb|1S|nt|sn00py27: Good morning all |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: can there be too many Catherines? |pg||

mb|d|nt|marlowepi: Play ball!|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: My Co-commentators are David Collier, Catherine Draper and Mark Horton and I am Geoffrey Wolfarth |pg||
nt|dburn: not much of an opening bid, those North cards, but these days almost anything goes|pg||
nt|ady: hi all|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|henryb: X = minor-major?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hi good evening everyone |pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|athene: club lead will get the defence off to a good start|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi stephen - do we know the systems in use?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: not off hand...|pg||
mb|2D|nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stayman was not out of the question|pg||
nt|athene: not only is it safe, but east gets to make two discards which might be helpful|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you were right in a way about the auction Bill. it was passed out. after the opening bid, that is :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes, stayman was a possibility with the north hand (intending to pass any rebid from opener)|pg||
nt|dburn: 1NT alerted - may be forcing, I guess, but about 2@c I am not sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: south is bidding a lot|pg||
nt|eggy: Just when West thought it was starting to look good|pg||
nt|henryb: then 2@h = pass or correct|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe South thinks it's a transfer and North doesn't|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case the final contract could be somewhat less than elegant|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Your commentators are Marshall Lewis and William Frisby|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@S looks makeable|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk7: Player names please operator|pg||
nt|athene: south has a very nice hand, even if she doesn't have a name yet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: usually they make it through a few hands before they play anonymously|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a LOT off|pg||
nt|eggy: quite a poor bid by east on reflection|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i can think of people who would open 2@C on that south hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi Catherine, Steve, Calle and Geoffrey. Havee fun :)|pg||
nt|dburn: not that there's much wrong with 2@d as a contract, but not by North-South|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  a bit of a push|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnc: Hi|pg||
nt|eggy: west almost guaranteed to hold 5 spade|pg||
nt|henryb: indeed: favorable breaks in all suits and @hA well placed|pg||
nt|mamos: whereas 1Nt would make so Catherine North has done well|pg||
nt|dburn: however, they seem to be on track|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: hi roland will do|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: a feisty auction and i am not sure whether this will be an objectively good result for the declaring side|pg||
nt|col3435: yes, how does 4@h do?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|dburn: this ought not to make, but with the favourable red suit position East-West could make about 2NT, so no great harm done|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: 2S plays well. but 1NT can make also|pg||
nt|col3435: seems to me like it might come in|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|athene: yes, there is the double heart finesse for declarer if she chooses to take it|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|dburn: still, not so obvious for West to play a red suit ace now, which is what she needs to do|pg||
nt|dburn: although I guess @d3 might also work|pg||
nt|dburn: and might be more accurate defence|pg||
nt|dburn: the point being that by playing diamonds twice more, West can in effect create a trump trick for herself|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: yes it may well but will e/w get there in the other room? n/s bidding i think helped|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn: but now she really does need to play a diamond, and not...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dburn: ...a spade|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|rnc: South was quite happy I suppose when seeing dummy with 5 spades|pg||
nt|dburn: now, provided Cath Jagger takes the right view of the clubs, she can succeed|pg||
pc|h2|nt|col3435: I'd say West always had enough to bid 4@h after East had raised|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Let's suppose North cashed a top club and then switched to the jack of diamonds - quite testing for declarer then |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: it is all about the first round of hearts and cashing only one diamond before playing hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but she will surely throw a heart here|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|rnc: yes|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: -800 seems predestined|pg||
nt|eggy: lucky it wasn't 1100 on that line|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: now south gets squeezed in spades and diamonds|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|dburn: a dollar short and a day late for that diamond, but declarer still not home|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: maybe Jagger cannot play west for club queen on such a defence|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|henryb: I think she should have ducked the first club|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: well, she would have done if declarer finessed hearts retaining a top diamond in hand|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|athene: sorry *East* gets squeezed|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: since S needs heart king on regardless, the choice is between 3-3 diamonds and heart ten being onside. the latter is more likely|pg||
nt|sn00py27: E might have dbled with an Ace so should get right|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ady: has done|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe she can - good effort|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|pc|c5|nt|dburn: might as well ruff a spade, just in case|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ady: could be good part score swing for england|pg||

nt|sn00py27: hi|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@H looks normal|pg||
nt|henryb: Mike. May your addition errors make little difference and your spelling be reasonable|pg||
nt|lestergold: no chanse of that Hnry and 2+2=5 in my maths |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hi Roland and all |pg||

nt|henryb: your favorite 20-20, Roland|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwww|pg||
nt|athene: although if north leads her partner's suit that will help|pg||
nt|athene: ouch|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: very hard to disagnose though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E took a real chance here...|pg||
nt|ady: tranfer to hearts     likely down 2 at 2 level|pg||
nt|dburn: may be one major, rather than a transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north was doing the thinking :) i doubt east had to think too hard about that one|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure the auction should be taking this long|pg||
nt|dburn: not particularly sound whatever it is, mind|pg||
nt|dburn: still, no one can ever double anyone for penalties nowadays|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rnc: This one will for sure be cheaper|pg||
nt|henryb: you are obviously not an accountant.|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i do have an oxford maths degree if it was cambrisge then id be able to add up|pg||
nt|henryb: Pender thinks she has died and gone to heaven|pg||
nt|lestergold: in oxford they only taught me how to punt|pg||
nt|mamos: horses or skiffs?|pg||
nt|henryb: there is a story of the CEO who wanted to find out what 2+2=|pg||
nt|henryb: He called in his economists. they said 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: without birth control 2+2 can equal quite a lot|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: i might have bid something over 1@C as east|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sn00py27: I thought we might get an idea on this hand whether they play weak or strong NT :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In these times many East's would open - especially with an eye on the vulnerability|pg||
nt|sn00py27: E/W|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this should be easy enough|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably better to play in 7D. at least you go off only one when diamonds break your heart|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D must be showing something like north's hand - and south ought to be getting mildly excited|pg||
nt|col3435: some convention cards at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/lmteams.htm|pg||
nt|col3435: N/S play "Acol with 5-card majors and a strong NT"|pg||
nt|col3435: E/W card isn't there but I think they play strong+5 too|pg||
nt|sn00py27: Not quite Acol then !|pg||
nt|ady: this wont make    but n/s likely to make 8 tricks in 1NT|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: the aces will take care of partner's @H+@C losers, however those two cards are split|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|col3435: well, yes. Seems like a contradiction in terms to me. But that's what they say.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: @SJ10 might be useful fillers...@DAK9 is great|pg||
nt|henryb: he did not like that, so he called in his information tech people. wait a moment they said, we will check on the computer|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: understandable that NS are hoping to create some action given the match score. but that 5C bid is infinitely more likely to widen the gap than to close it|pg||
nt|athene: East will be disappointed to get only her top trumps from here|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|nt|athene: admittedly you don't want to bid a grand slam when there is a chance they might not reach the small slam in the other room|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, so down two may show a profit, but there are easier ways to make a living|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am puzzled why N did not respond 2D|pg||
nt|athene: a 6-card minor is shorter than a 5-card major, for most people, these days|pg||
nt|col3435: (it probably just means "not 2/1 GF")|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: i am sorry to say|pg||
nt|eggy: good defence|pg||
nt|henryb: back they came. 4 they said|pg||
nt|lestergold: good start for Catherine|pg||
nt|henryb: he did not like that, so he called in the accountants|pg||
nt|lestergold: east may well be endoplayed more times thanm she likes for her visit to heavan|pg||
nt|henryb: What would you like it to be, they asked? :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|marlowepi: EW would probably get another trick if W continued spades, but that is not too likely|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but there is more to it than that. 2D has the advantage of announcing strength immediately also|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: i think with all those keycards for diamonds, south should not stop below 6@D after north bids 4@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suppose N was concerned about a rebid of 2H from S. but is 2D GF ion their methods? not normally in these countries, is it?|pg||
nt|athene: well, i don't know N-S's methods, but i am assuming Acol-ish, so things tend not to be forcing :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think both N and S are guilty of underbidding here|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|chessmaste: 1NT is comfortable, might be a more interesting deal if East opens |pg||
nt|roswolf: ah i am glad we have a translator on the commentary team:)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|nt|dburn: I am told that 2@d may have been "hearts, or spades and a longer minor"|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: a mistake from declarer - she had to ruff a heart there|pg||
nt|dburn: which sounds like fun, so no wonder West wanted to use her gadget|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: it was alerted as that|pg||
nt|dburn: East, on the other hand, may wish that her partner had got some other toy for Christmas|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h6|nt|athene: now the @C10 is going to score|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|eggy: almost|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm perhaps not|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|athene: it's very hard to knuckle down and devote your full energies to turning a catastrophe into a mere disaster :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: psychologically you just want to be rid of the board as fast as possible|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dburn: still, she's handling it pretty well, and the defence hasn't quite made the best of things|pg||

nt|chessmaste: Not a great line - there was an easy overtrick avalable|pg||
nt|roswolf: a 20/20 hcp hand - how high will e/w go?|pg||
nt|eggy: If S had continued spades from the top, N could have underplayed teh S5 for the same effect of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe it wa purgatory rather than heavan|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|chessmaste: Roland would like this - a 20/20 deal|pg||
nt|ady: nice multi|pg||
mb|2N|nt|marlowepi: that is the humnan reality, true, though in international matches one is more or less expected to overcome those foibles|pg||
nt|mamos: i think the hand was played rotated so op had problems  as it seems did the players and commentators|pg||
nt|mugsmate: That sort of multi makes me feel old. Routine when I was at university 15 years ago.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You are lucky, it makes *me* feel sick|pg||
nt|mugsmate: First in at favourable vulnerability is a good time to be a bit random, so long as your partner knows not to punish you.|pg||
nt|ady: if they get the club suit right then 3T will make|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: alerted as weak major, max 7pts|pg||
nt|mugsmate: The multi may be just what is required to protect that club queen.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that Multi may cause declarer not to get clubs right|pg||
nt|ady: Jagger may sacrifice in 4@H|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: N should not have that worry when S cues 5C|pg||
nt|roswolf: will south fancy this hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would be tempted to bid 2@C over 1@H with East |pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT overcall?|pg||
nt|henryb: over an opening 1@s do you overcall 1N or double and bid 2N|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT for me|pg||
nt|sn00py27: opp passed hand I am happy to settle with 1NT|pg||
nt|henryb: I think I would double and bid 2N actually|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east doubled 1@D intending to bid spades next and show a strong hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has announced a strong NT, and six is cold facing both round aces and diamond KQ, which is only 13|pg||
nt|chessmaste: South might protect |pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be finis|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1nt not unreasonable all acions are going to be distorted with this hand|pg||
nt|sn00py27: but I would do something with S - unless they play 2@C as conventional and she has no easy bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1n is the closest|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Just 3H. If you play this random style, you have to play it as a PARTNERSHIP. Jagger can't go to 4H when partner may be so weak.|pg||
nt|ady: 4H could be 500 or 800 |pg||
nt|dburn: trouble is, she still doesn't know which major her partner has|pg||
mb|p|pc|s8|nt|athene: she doesn't really want her next decision to be selecting a lead to 1@DX|pg||
nt|athene: it's a pretty good suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: she appears to|pg||
nt|dburn: if it turns out to be spades, 4@s might even be making|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Interestingly, north has shown 4-4 in the majors and south has shown 5 hearts, so there is no real reason to get the clubs wrong anymore.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: south should bid 2c surely|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: i wouldn;t need to be tempted. i would do it before temptation even arose|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i would not like to play the n/s hands at the 3 level but maybe that is why i am commentating these days|pg||
nt|henryb: yes, or double 1N would be my choice|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm this auction seems illogical|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Enterprising and unlucky to find partner with most of her points in spades|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: i assume West in fact didn't pass|pg||
nt|sn00py27: should make 3@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: she has the theoretical values for a double but hand is too top heavy for it for my liking|pg||
nt|mamos: Pass would be a field if partner had psyched|pg||
nt|henryb: partner is third hand at favorable ...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk5: No, it's mainly because you are not a woman|pg||
nt|roswolf: east has saved the opps bacon|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They won't allow you in even if you shave, Geoffrey|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it is probably getting tken out as indeed it was and then u have to show trhis limite dhand at the 3 level|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: either South or West probably bid 1@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you dont want a spade lead from Txxxx or some rubbish against 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: presumably south denied 4 spades by bidding 2nt|pg||
nt|sn00py27: as 8 counts go - it is quite decent|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes has the 2 extra 9's|pg||
nt|lestergold: even more reason to bid a quiet 2 clubs|pg||
nt|mamos: i like 2C because if partner is light you have tolerance for @S and no great harm is done|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate this hand was always likely to finish where it has|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe N simply did the multiplication and made the bid that would complete the equation|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3@H I don't care for|pg||
nt|chessmaste: or 3@S|pg||
nt|sn00py27: me neither, was thinking of passing back to partner or 2NT|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: well, good old partner found a club lead anyway :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 3@S was very hasty|pg||
nt|col3435: yes it ought to be possible for N/S to scramble to their best fit after the Dbl|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3@S has two chances - slim and none|pg||
nt|col3435: but evidently a confident 3@h has its merits|pg||
nt|lestergold: and its infrangible|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mugsmate: Key moment|pg||
nt|ady: a lot of imps here|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Seems that only if south is exactly 3541 or 2551 does south have a singleton club. There are more shapes where south has 2 clubs.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|henryb: I prefer impregnable|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: and 1NT or 2NT is a likely enough rebid for S|pg||
nt|ady: roof falls in|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: a new one but be careful Henry some of these ladies are quite young |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: it is not devoid of hope - defence may assist|pg||
nt|rnc: Due to the CC, a direct 2NT would have been xfer to @D - so this will presumably be their way to invite "1NT-2NT"|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: why didn't south rebid 1@S?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h8|nt|henryb: yes, well ...|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|d2|pg||

nt|eggy: at least on the 800 hand - Stockdale bid the making game (5D)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: an awful lot of slams in this set already. what's up with that? a spec asked if this is goulasch LOL|pg||
nt|athene: Multi-2@D; east might try 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb: a bad unbiddable 3N?|pg||
nt|henryb: that happens to make|pg||
nt|ady: a diamond slam for e/w|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Six diamonds by east is a great spot here - the play complicated by the unlucky 3-0 trump break.|pg||
nt|ady: if they get the diamond right|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: now this could be fun|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mamos: 16 +8 will they bid 3NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: an awful lot of slam bidding, and vice versa :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|marlowepi: looks like the Multi. either that or everybody has a fatal attraction for the 2D card in the bidding box (as did S on the previous hand)|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D is certainly spades but hard to be sure what strength it shows|pg||
nt|athene: there are several schemes for rebids here, and west might be cautiously treating it as minimum or optimistically treating it as maximium|pg||
nt|rnc: And if bid and made twice, it'll be... 800 :)|pg||
nt|dburn: unlucky start to the auction - will now play the wrong way round for the Burn Percentage Play to work|pg||
nt|ady: if south does not lead a club   can make even mis guessing the diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 5C may not be a great idea when one opp has passed and your partner has not|pg||
nt|petepunt:  evening all|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi peter|pg||
nt|petepunt:  hi we know the pairs|pg||
mb|3S|nt|roswolf: 2@D = multi or weak 2 diamonds?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: @D|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty|pg||
nt|eggy: If she'd tried 6, she'd have made that too I suppose|pg||
nt|dburn: however, after this start they may reach only 3NT anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: but East has done well|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|athene: i think north could afford to take it a bit slower|pg||
nt|athene: one opponent has passed|pg||
nt|athene: and you have a fair amount in the majors|pg||
nt|eggy: unless West leads a spade|pg||
nt|sn00py27: 1nt - 3NT ?|pg||
nt|henryb: at most 2N|pg||
nt|dburn: West has plenty of extra playing strength, but no really convenient way to show it|pg||
nt|mugsmate: I agree east hass done well, but a byproduct of 3S is that south may well lead a club now.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: tracy is in aggressive mood today|pg||
mb|4N|nt|athene: @CAK @DAK for the defence here, and they don't have to find them right away|pg||
nt|athene: although they do have to be a little bit careful|pg||
nt|lestergold: combined 24 good intermediates 3n a fair shot and it makes comfortably on any lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and it's game-all - opps aren't at favourable or anything scary like that|pg||
nt|dburn: well, they are in six now|pg||
mb|5H|nt|sn00py27: East's bidding on this hand has worked well|pg||
nt|chessmaste: They have done well - hardly obvious to insist on game facing a weak two in diamonds|pg||
nt|sn00py27: good start|pg||
nt|lestergold: north should go|pg||
nt|dburn: or very shortly|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well they sort of do, after AK of clubs|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|rnc: Yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: look how bad this 3N is: needs both black suits to run and not to lose 4@d and the @sA|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, they do now|pg||
nt|lestergold: its far from throw against wall but i think that its a vulnerable game that should be bid|pg||
pc|cT|nt|dburn: one indication may come if South leads @c10, though - short clubs implies long diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: excellent slam  will be unlucky to go down|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sn00py27: v poor until everything breaks :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: could @DA and another ever be wrong?|pg||
nt|lestergold: its thinnish but tghe intermediates create additional chances as here with clubs breaking 4/2 but the ten of clubs to the rescue etc|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade intermediates good- dims can b e blocked or notm led when they are 5/3|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would want to be in this game|pg||
nt|henryb: It is about 50% for each black suit. so both is 25%. you have some other chances but not many|pg||
nt|dburn: well, I would go down for sure, but East may draw the right inference|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Perhaps east will deduce the lead is from shortage, so cater to trump length with the leader.|pg||

pc|d8|nt|athene: a very comfortable contract here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: who put dummy down?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Suit quality is a factor for some players|pg||
nt|roswolf: provoking opps to bid a game which they might not have reached unaided is the downside of such pre-empts|pg||
nt|sn00py27: not to mention the 500 that was on offer from 4@H :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: True, but assuming South would have opened 1@D game was sure to be reached|pg||
nt|roswolf: a more telling point catherine!|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Hard to double 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: in my view east should bid 3h over 2s- amaybe a slight overbid but she is under pressure and partner needs to know how good those hearst are|pg||
nt|lestergold: partner knows that she is under pressure|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n is appaling|pg||
nt|henryb: I do not agree. she is at least an ace light for 3@h|pg||
nt|ady: best lead|pg||

nt|dburn: ought to lead a low heart rather than an honour if she leads one at all, but this diamond may well prove effective|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: with thin stops double was unwise|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos: to be fair strong suits in weak hands can be dificult  I think East has shown her hand well|pg||
nt|lestergold: pushing them to 4h which as we can see cn make on a spade lead|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Good lead - partner hadn't doubled stayman & the opponents have a major each...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chessmaste: We will soon be on to the next deal now|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 2 or 3 down|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: well now will east play the courageous and only line to make|pg||
nt|henryb: I think 4@h is cold on any lead, Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: u dont double one game in ordeer to push them into one u cant double|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes u are right henry |pg||

nt|Walddk7: The lady on lead|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|nt|henryb: and I think N was wrong to double 3N, a contract she thinks she can beat|pg||
nt|lestergold: dims cant be enjoyed thru comunications lack|pg||
nt|sn00py27: I would have sat happily defending 3NT as North :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: i think "9 tricks" is a safer prediction this board|pg||
nt|Walddk7: She thought she was dummy|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: why duck and let thyem attack diamonds|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|sn00py27: good effort the 10@S - they can see those clubs setting up|pg||
nt|mamos: better to double 3NT if you think you can beat 4@H :)|pg||

pc|d9|nt|athene: i remember one time i was playing in a local duplicate and partner was on lead|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|dburn: may be down only one - can endplay either opponent, but not for nine tricks|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|nt|athene: and looked enquiringly at me (as in, to see if i had any questions)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this line by declarer is not so precise|pg||
nt|athene: and i said "small please, partner" without thinking|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: i guess i had been playing too many of them|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dburn: but this has scrambled her communications somewhat|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|dT|nt|tejjyid: the defense can tap dummy so thew @S suit is dead|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: east can see that a dim switch is horrid why did she duck the first spade?|pg||
nt|ady: its easier to end play opps from here David|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dburn: understandable, though - she had to hope to make something of the hearts, and wanted to keep @sA as an entry|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: lol|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: east has not spotted that the contract depends upon the simple finese of the ten of clubs well it did|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|eggy: a bit unfortunate lead I suppose|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: it's usually a mistake in hands like this to allow the defence to draw a third round of trumps|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h8|nt|roswolf: a club lead would have been testing|pg||

nt|tejjyid: well, maybe North won't open that hand next time|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes "very comfortable" contracts just don;t fetch|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Aggressive bidding is a good tactic if your declarer play has the gift of squeezing the extra trick out of things|pg||
nt|chessmaste: This might be interesting|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: and if north bids spades enthusiastically, that can only help west|pg||

mb|1D|nt|petepunt:  1@S will do here|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ady: not a hand for anyone to make anything|pg||
mb|d!|nt|chessmaste: Not for me - and it will give the game away here |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: west of course doesn't expect that her partner has so little wasted in spades|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt would have worked out fine as well, even though they are off the club suit|pg||
nt|ady: can make 2@H  |pg||
mb|p|nt|diumraid: Current in Running Scores are as follows  N-IRELAND  19,  ENGLAND  16,   IRELAND  16,  SCOTLAND 14, CBAI 14, WALES  11|pg||
nt|col3435: a spade lead might also give the game away|pg||
mb|2H|nt|petepunt:  3@S was possible with 2 aces,  but a bit thin for a slam try|pg||
nt|chessmaste: West will have an awkward lead against 4@H|pg||
nt|sn00py27: very dangerous with 4333|pg||
nt|mamos: are NS too high already?|pg||
nt|lestergold: that case may end up with fornsic investigators in the cold case files|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: they will play 4@S now and just lose @H @C @C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this deal looks like a 2-bid auction to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|sn00py27: I wd probably fish out the 4 @S - not a success here |pg||
nt|lestergold: well maybe they are but they havent done anything wrong yet|pg||
nt|dburn: or beat 1NT a trick - not perhaps altogether wise for South to volunteer to play the hand rather than defend it|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: I'd have the @s4 on the table in a flash, and declarer would be very grateful|pg||
nt|sn00py27: not sure our support for the lead will make West feel any better !|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In one sense North did well not to respond 1@S  |pg||
pc|s7|nt|tejjyid: this looks safe enough - time for a quick cuppa|pg||
nt|dburn: but whether South or West bid 1NT, East was going to venture 2@h anyway|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petepunt:  predict 13?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: with the NOrth cards opposite a 15-17 NT, 3NTdirectly is tempting|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: what does 2c mean?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 2d?|pg||
nt|sn00py27: puppet to 2@D which you can pass if weak with @D|pg||
nt|henryb: transfer to 2@d; start of possibly invitational sequences|pg||
nt|mamos: i think this is a good piece of convention but not sure Souths hand is suitable|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah hah|pg||
nt|sn00py27: or make invitational bids - 2@D over 1NT would be GF|pg||
nt|mamos: gladiator|pg||
nt|lestergold: but what is wrong with 1n soutgh is not weak|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|henryb: by a passed hand perhaps not the best use of the bids|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|lestergold: 1n struggles mainly because of bad break in dimaonds! |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: certainly 13 now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|eggy: not Mike Lawrences view though|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: by which same token 8 tricks in diamonds becomes a tall order|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In some book I suggested a lead from a king was very dangerous - and a trump was also bad - plus underleading an ace was out of the question|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sn00py27: maybe in pairs ok, but too dangerous for me at imps|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|lestergold: spade switch neede to cut off heart trick|pg||
nt|henryb: much as I love aces, I might not open the N hand|pg||

pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|h2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: Henry with the greatest respect failure tio open a hand containing 3 aces is a hanging offence in these parts|pg||
nt|dburn: but declarer is giving herself plenty to do here, though she will probably survive|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: sometimes it is good to use conventions in close decisions, as it keeps you from forgetting them|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: of course if you are worried partner is on the point of forgetting them, you have a knife-edge decision|pg||
nt|tejjyid: also if u r tired & emotional, process may be better than judgement|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Good! Going to Sanremo?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: use them to jog his memory, or avoid them in case he forgets? :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: or removal by men in whjite coats|pg||
nt|dburn: or maybe not|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|dK|nt|eggy: on the grounds that unless partner is 1444 you must fetch an 8 card fit|pg||

pc|d9|pc|h6|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: but was it well defended?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: 3nt just needs 4-3 spades or no spade lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: we have an extra pass in here, operator|pg||
nt|athene: need undo|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the barrage will make things difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: well, this is fair enough|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: many pairs have ways to distinguish a good 2H raise from a nuisance raise over doublke|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H might be a much weaker hand - it would be useful to have 2@D available as a good 3-card raise|pg||
nt|petepunt:  2@d best used as a 8-10 3 card raise|pg||
nt|tejjyid: My least favourite standard auction|pg||
nt|tejjyid: SOuth's pass is very conservative |pg||
nt|athene: i wouldn't be happy as south about never showing the most important feature of my hand - my spade fit|pg||

nt|lestergold: in any case this does not look like a hand likely to ive rise to any embarrasin post mortems|pg||

nt|lestergold: another coffee break hand we need a couple of these after the recent excitmenet|pg||

nt|henryb: in my book 2@c is natural, nf and not particularly encouraging|pg||
nt|sn00py27: assuming it would be natural |pg||
nt|roswolf: another poor decision except tracy seems to have jumped into the fire|pg||

nt|athene: even if 4@H were fit-showing, surely you pass with @HKxx?|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Red save in 4S one off against 4H here due to the side fit in diamonds. In practise no-one could come in, let alone diagnose the double fit.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: more likely north was scared it was a splinter?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she thought splinter|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 2@C non forcing is popular - but not with Acol players:)|pg||
nt|col3435: yes this 2@c is an Acoly bid|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|henryb: a very useful dummy. it is easy to construct one on which 4@h has no play|pg||

nt|marlowepi: what is E worth if W can't double 1D but did anyway? most systems don;t cover that :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3@H will endplay partner - why not 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: lead holds it to 4 |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|henryb: but my book recommends transfers after the opponent's to doubles as an alternative|pg||

pc|c5|nt|tejjyid: Even with 13 penalty cards, this would be a tough hand to make|pg||

pc|h7|nt|henryb: not badly as in DOIGB (Down One Is Good Bridge) :)|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: statistically, the odds favor this not being the first time the potential ambiguity of this auction has come up. in that case S might have reflected that a response of 1H--however ...|pg||

mb|2D|nt|lestergold: the bad news of the4/1 trump break balancede by the favourable position of the spade K|pg||

nt|roswolf: n/s should play in 5@D quite easily|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 3@C is aggressive here|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S is reasonable enough...she has shown her hand by doubling i guess|pg||

pc|sK|nt|athene: assuming it's "standard"; i.e. game-forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this N hand looks a lot more like an overcall than did the S hand on   5|pg||
nt|henryb: On the lead of the @d3 a case can be made for playing low from dummy: North has only one higher card and S might have led high from many holdings including AK|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n just as good a spot|pg||
nt|mamos: ah so a variation|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: e.g. north might think that 3@S shows long spades and no diamond stop|pg||

pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: the double seems dubious|pg||
nt|athene: east had better not rise with that @DK|pg||
nt|sn00py27: the game that geoffrey and david wanted to bid on board 8 has got home - a winning spade got discarded|pg||
nt|sn00py27: 6 imps to england|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Very strange as up to that point West had discarded perfectly |pg||
nt|lestergold: good plahy of 7 clubs|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: dummy's stiff D will be a very welcome surprise|pg||
nt|athene: this will probably go down|pg||
nt|athene: there are only two obvious losers (@DA, trump)|pg||
nt|athene: but south can overruff spades|pg||
nt|athene: if you draw three rounds of trumps you have a couple of spade losers|pg||
nt|athene: since north has that precious @S8|pg||
nt|athene: dummy is a bit short of entries to get the hearts going|pg||
nt|athene: she knows her partner has nothing, more or less|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H might actually have been the only making game?|pg||
nt|athene: a good example of how you want the weaker hand's long suit to be trumps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and why bother? if a major is going to be 3-3, much better for it to be spades|pg||
nt|athene: because it's useless otherwise|pg||
nt|athene: yes, sure|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: now 11 tricks available|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mugsmate: Close decision to pass 2D - 2H certainly a possible choice by south. That Jxx in the suit on the right is a big turnoff though when spades aren't raised.|pg||

nt|athene: declarer will play @SAK, ruff, and lose the three obvious tricks, i imagine|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: any plain suit W might lead would be pretty much a shot in the dark. at least when you lead a trump you know what your goal is, and that your lead is a step toward that goal|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|diumraid: ******  In Running Scores ******* -  LIVE from LIMERICK ********-   N-Ireland 20, CBAI 17, ENGLAND 16, SCOTLAND 14, IRELAND 13, WALES 10|pg||
nt|eggy: good lead - easy to let this in without it I think|pg||
nt|eggy: oh|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: i assumed it was some number of controls|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS live right. this dreadful contract is cold|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D = 0-1 control, 2@H = 2, 2@S = 3?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Having bid 2@H on the first round North might have recovered with a subtle 3@D on the next|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: (A=2, K=1)|pg||
nt|athene: but south obviously thought it was natural|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks infrangible and more imps to CBAI|pg||
nt|eggy: and with it perhaps|pg||
nt|sn00py27: i was thinking it looked pretty safe on any lead, although I would favour a @H - dummy is probably with 4@S|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: in the other room north never bid over a weak nt - must be losing tactics with a 15 count imo|pg||
nt|sn00py27: partner had passed, so they had an excuse :)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tejjyid: Closed room did well here|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: E-W lead 4th best|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: 6@S isn't all that bad|pg||
nt|marlowepi: If I ended up in 6S making on this layout, I would ask the opps if we could just score it as 1370 instead of 1430, so we could tell our teammates we played in 6C. it would be worth ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the lost 2 IMPs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: 3-3 spades, @SQx, @SQxxx onside|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: hahahaha|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|sQ|pc|c5|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tejjyid: so, from QT96, duck was correct...|pg||
nt|athene: the @H6 couldn't be from @HQ1096 but it might have been @HQ106 or @HQ96 i suppose|pg||
nt|eggy: club now|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: excellent compared to our usual slams Bill, but the right frame of comparison is vis a vis 6C|pg||
nt|sn00py27: she had 9 tricks a second ago - why take the finesse ?|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|diumraid: ****  LIVE  IN RUNNING from LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  N-IRELAND 63, SCOTLAND 51, IRELAND 46, ENGLAND 46, CBAI 36,  WALES 27  *****|pg||
pc|c2|pc|sT|pc|cQ|nt|athene: surely the @H10 would be led from @HQ109(x)?|pg||
nt|henryb: Is 3@d valus in @d or a suggestion of an alternative contract?|pg||
nt|ady: contract looks safe now|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Although England have played modestly in this room they are recovering some points at the end of the session|pg||
pc|s9|nt|eggy: isn't she short of anentry (unless she guesses hearts?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|tejjyid: plausibly|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: if W has the heart queen, S can concede a trick to it later|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s8|nt|rnc: Oh, no...|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sn00py27: she had 3 clubs - 2 spades, 1 heart and 3 diamonds = 9|pg||

nt|marlowepi: Bill, you need to add to your list of the virtues of 6S "no D lead or D king with opening leader"|pg||
nt|athene: and no club ruff :)|pg||
nt|athene: N-S might be a bit abashed but they will still write "1430" down|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: and lastly to BBO and of course Roland Wald who organises all these Vu-Graph presentations|pg||
nt|lestergold: well n/s have done well to stay out of game on this hnad but northn had  agame try and south an accept just  unlucky with the duplication of values on the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnc: And also to the audience for their tips...|pg||
nt|rnc: ...and to you Geoffrey|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: well this looks good for 8 tricks at the very least|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: might still make 12 on Q@D lead|pg||
nt|mugsmate: 4S seems to be an underbid with all those controls and Kx in partner's side suit.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mugsmate: Seale - Jagger certainly bid extremely well this set - one or two slight misdefences, but a strong performance from the England pair overall.|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Thanks all, goodnight.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: no doubt S would have doubled 3D if she didnt like the other unbid suit even better|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thanks to Lady Milne for inspiring the eponymous trophy that crowns this event|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: sometimesw underbidding is rewaqrdede|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: rewarded|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: well that lead solves a certain problem for declarer|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the "9th trick" problem...|pg||
nt|athene: namely, where trick number nine is coming from|pg||
nt|ady: england not so good OR    missed the 6@D slam   and were not in game on board 29 the board Jagger opened the multi|pg||
nt|ady: nite Jon|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|athene: the next match is coming up shortly - in about 30 minutes, i think|pg||
nt|sn00py27: as well as some overbidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: just as overbidding was rewarded to ROI when they bid a bad 3n which couldnt be beaten|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: diamond back could be best    if that is ruffed  then very likely trumps will be breaking and diamonds can be set up|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: will need to negotiate an extra club trick on this play|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: S retuirned her 4th best spade at Trick 2 as the books say one should. but probably not on this hand--to beat 3NT partner will need an entry--and even then where will we get 5 ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tricks? S should play back Q of spades hoping for a duck (correct if spades are 5-3), then if N turns up with only four spades (by following up the line), she can shift to diamonds|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sn00py27: all she had to do on the last was cross to dummy' ace - finesse the diamond again and claim 9|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|eggy: should hold this now as South has show 15 points|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it won;t help on this hand, of course, but W might have only Jxx of clubs|pg||
nt|eggy: or not|pg||
nt|jallerton: restart in 20 mins|pg||
