nt|capercliff: welcome back folks!|pg||
nt|viren169: Hi|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning all - now we have another completely untried partnership in the Ireland EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|jcomyn: lets hope the boards are as lively as this morning|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lots and lots of imps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I have played golf this morning, so let´s see lots of imps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this aint right anyway|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh yes it is sorry|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: It will be interesting to see how West copes with 2@H from South|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S will not be great success |pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe.....|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Hi all - Hi Shirley  John Comyn here|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello John welcome |pg||
nt|jcomyn: dfidnt recognise the new caps on the NI team|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: a slam. should not be hard to bid: the problem, I think, will be to avoid seven on power|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jcomyn: h partial |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: hi all again|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hi all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: big match this - both well in contention|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jallerton: Your commentators are Ian Crorie, Cliff Gillis, Sarah Teshome and myself.|pg||
nt|viren169: Much easier route to 4@H now|pg||
nt|viren169: assuming 2@C was majs|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Morning John, Peter and Gad|pg||
nt|jcomyn: an ouch already|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 19-20 NT onbviously|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|idc: NS are playing 15-17 NT, 5 card majors, 3 card minors|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good contract but...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wish I were you lovely day here and me watching bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: England have brought in a new pair.  Catherine Seale (West ) is playing her first Lady Milne|pg||
nt|pkl: Why 2@D if 2@C was majors? I believe 2@C must be something else.|pg||
nt|pkl: Morning Roland|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like they all have something to say here...|pg||
nt|sybarra: I had just said not a success, but could it be done?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this will test N in a big way|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi ralf  John Comyn here|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Hearts coming into the picture now...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: no sinecure|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pkl: After a club to the ace and switch to diamonds, declarer might well fail.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning Roland|pg||
nt|pkl: But 5@C is a very cheap save|pg||
nt|viren169: North is likely to switch to the J of @S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hi again John and John|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tihas: hi all|pg||
pc|s9|nt|toobad: good evening all|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sybarra: oops |pg||
nt|jcomyn: C switch |pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: now down  |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|capercliff: 11h is not so easy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: naw|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jcomyn: well that solves the defence|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|tihas: so this is the last match in the championship, and 4 teams are rather close at the end of round robin|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lively start anyway|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... -2 for a (probable) par result! |pg||
nt|toobad: yeah lol|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcomyn: jeepers NS playing this|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jcomyn: the 2H overcall should warn her|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I have a wish to play golf in Ireland rather soon|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: Monte Carlo had a good win in the last round.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Aivar Tihane from Estonia|pg||
nt|capercliff: 1@h|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|chick: even 1 isn't :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and at least 8 tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now N is in a spot of bother|pg||
pc|d3|nt|capercliff: lol|pg||
nt|capercliff: should be ok though|pg||
nt|capercliff: cant give up 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: any idea where|pg||
nt|jcomyn: NSE or W|pg||
pc|h8|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think the @s9 mislead N|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jcomyn: so is W with that play|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pkl: Perhaps only down one, viren?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tihas: un summary, monte carlo has a 13.5 VP lead over Druva, so for Druva to have a chance for the gold they must win at least 22-8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @CK is (almost certainly) marked, so draw trumps and play a club towards the queen - may be a problem if trumps 3-1 and clubs 5-1|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like all the players are keen to make their mark early in the match!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely this is a CRTFH hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no idea at all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no forgot the H10|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pkl: Pender hoping for more clubs at East. This was not to be|pg||
nt|sybarra: except that...short in hts and not much esle to ruff |pg||
pc|h2|nt|tihas: then there is another match, where Roheline Lammas plays Ekspromt, and the former has basically the same number of VP as Druva|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jcomyn: one down could be a good start for wales|pg||
nt|sybarra: *else|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|idc: not sure I liked that 2nd round of @h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: true I suppose|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chick: too late now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|toobad: afternoon all|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|henryb: drawing trumps does not look right, although not fatal on this layout|pg||
nt|jallerton: W has control now|pg||
nt|chick: nor I, no reason not to repeat the finesse missing that many trumps|pg||
nt|capercliff: down now|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jcomyn: if N play Portrush or Royal Co Down ; W Rosses Point; S Killarney or Tralee and E  European club|pg||
pc|s8|nt|idc: seemed to stake everything on 3-3 hearts when there was no rush to commit yourself|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ruff hgh and then low|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi John|pg||
pc|sA|nt|idc: hmmm, even 3-3 @h might not have been enough|pg||
nt|capercliff: @s was best after first @h|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hi John!|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|jcomyn: now d guess|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: think we might be making this one now |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two rounds ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: nicely done |pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcomyn: u beginning to hope?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jcomyn: thats well done|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|viren169: well done|pg||

nt|capercliff: so 3-3 @h was unlickly|pg||
nt|jcomyn: great to see clubs come into their own at last|pg||
nt|pkl: I've heard that winning the Lady Milne Cup is almost as important to the Irish as winning the six nations, but that might be overdoing it|pg||
nt|pkl: Will East open? Would you guys?|pg||
nt|viren169: just a bit!|pg||
nt|sybarra: this spade suit would be easier to play :)|pg||
nt|toobad: when Ciara and Diane have the cards and are on form, anything possible!!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But in fact - with Q10s on dummy and 19-20 on the opener, a @h cannot be right|pg||
mb|2S|nt|capercliff: unlikely even|pg||
nt|thegarve:  hi all|pg||
nt|capercliff: hey Martin|pg||
nt|jallerton: Welcome to Martin Garvey (England)|pg||
nt|idc: I was remionded of some dates I've been on years ago|pg||
nt|viren169: No|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sure is, but Ireland will NOT be winning the Lady Milne|pg||
nt|pkl: Do you have the standings, Bjorling?|pg||
nt|viren169: Bal'd 11 counts are looking for swings!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I think NI has every chance|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes! once I had contact with Golf & leisure Ireland. They sponsored a tournament at my club once a year|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but now it´s bridge....|pg||
nt|toobad: sorry folks, Ciara Burns and Diane Greenwood ........... in the open room, i hope!! lol|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont care for that S suit lol|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but makes things difficult|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but you are right John - always 4@h + 3@d + @sA = 8|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|pkl: Pass - really must be a question of style|pg||
nt|viren169: The Hackett boys would have opened East's hand in their sleep!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Northern Ireland 1, Scotland 2, Ireland 3, Ireland B 4 England 5  Wales 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: better to defend 2@s as EW and play it|pg||
nt|toobad: it will keep them out of trouble and 3/3 break |pg||
mb|3D|nt|idc: some of them were unlickly too :)|pg||
nt|thegarve:  evening Cliff Jeffrey and Ian|pg||
nt|toobad: is that leb?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tihas: S aggressive opening bid mught get NS to 3NT|pg||
nt|tihas: which actually makes on a low spade lead|pg||
nt|capercliff: 41s is a practical bid here|pg||
nt|jallerton: can N avoid partner's suit?|pg||
nt|jallerton: well done|pg||
nt|capercliff: Scots better cash their tricks|pg||
nt|idc: hi Martin|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ralfwil: I ment instead of play it..|pg||
nt|toobad: at least the vulnerability is in their favour|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree John, but points in is better....|pg||
nt|toobad: this isnt a speedball then?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: who wants to play in S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  missed the first set and it looks to be  a close match|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I would open the E hand if I were dead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a real crunchy 11 count Not Vul|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whatever it is TROUBLE|pg||
nt|toobad: here we go|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Intersting this 2@C bid... seems like it can be used for any hand!|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: cutting down the ruffs early|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: but off on a heart lead - all up to East now|pg||
nt|tihas: so rather fortunate 11 imps for Monte carlo|pg||
nt|viren169: Do we know what 2@C is? single suiter?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: D or both majors I imagine|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure where we are going here |pg||
nt|jcomyn: neither are they|pg||
nt|ralfwil: from a small trouble to a bigger|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why not pass 3D anything is better than this|pg||
nt|jcomyn: NI new pair setting out stall early|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcomyn: ante|pg||
nt|viren169: Makes sense now...|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|sybarra: this might be best |pg||
pc|cK|nt|pkl: Could 2@C be four spades and another?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jcomyn: dont think so, they play ante|pg||
nt|sybarra: sp taps and what does W do? |pg||
pc|c4|nt|idc: Ace is for reverse attitude, so they should cash out|pg||
nt|capercliff: udca|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I cant figure this bidding|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: here |pg||
nt|ralfwil: If I must bid on S I had prefered 2nt (15-17) before D|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|idc: wild boards in 1st half, lots of slams|pg||
nt|sybarra: here is tap  1 |pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can knock out @DA for nine tricks |pg||
nt|ralfwil: a small @h had been better|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: as spades are 4-3 |pg||
nt|viren169: I guess we will have to wait until next hand to know for sure...|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s4|pc|c8|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pkl: Ah - sorry. Did stare a bit at that word. I don't know that convention ;-)|pg||
nt|viren169: Nice defence...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ante is 2C=D or both majors; 2D= H or S and a aminor; 2H H and a minor ; 2S=S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes the trump attack is good and works well|pg||
pc|h6|nt|idc: in one with perfect fits and 3 grand slams available for NS, england reached game & scotland 4@d :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: duck! no exit card!|pg||

nt|jcomyn: these are again very tricky boards|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5@c on W but how?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|capercliff: 2@h will need a bit of luck|pg||
nt|pkl: Kelly knew that ;-)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: notice that excellent hand to start was a mere 2S in open room - jeepers|pg||
nt|viren169: Now North may roll back in with a dble...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: WHACK|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|toobad: d trans coming up|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  East will protect with a double|pg||
nt|viren169: and E/W will take the push to 3@S|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|idc: just about to suggest the same thing|pg||
nt|idc: it isn't mandatory at teams, but just about worth it I think|pg||
nt|jallerton: giving W a decision|pg||
nt|capercliff: 2@s will need even more luck|pg||
nt|capercliff: I cant imagine W floating it|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and they mat even play in the 33 @s fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|tihas: it would be tempting to pass on 2@s with E hand|pg||
nt|tihas: but you have to be fairly certain that partner would balance also with 6 hcp|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East goes for the vulnerable game - might even have bid 3NT |pg||
nt|jallerton: in which case East did well to pass out 2@h|pg||
nt|idc: 3-3 fits are good for you, they often play quite well|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like Knight got their 1st!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and interesting hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: even I wouldnt bid 2S on that rubbish|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: for one thing, the fdefenders rarely realize what's afoot|pg||
nt|capercliff: might make 2@h on this lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: I'd still prefer to defend 2@h that play in the concealed 3-3 fit vulnerable|pg||
nt|thegarve:  the 33 fit often plays rather well|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes because you normally have a 9-card side suit:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: also 3nt on W with a @h lead|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: South might have led the @SJ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|viren169: dble by S is a bit risky with West still unlimited|pg||
nt|viren169: and only 3 hearts|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|viren169: Cant see any line to make this...|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is a trick she didnt have |pg||
nt|jcomyn: and a really bad lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and with @dA on N always 9 tricks in nt|pg||
nt|toobad: i prefer 2nt rather than 3d from W|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|tihas: the 2@s opening actually got NS out of the trouble with bad @h break|pg||
nt|jcomyn: was 2D a transfer?|pg||
nt|toobad: doubt it |pg||
nt|jcomyn: then why did E bid 2H?|pg||
nt|toobad: prob dont play transfers to minors over interference|pg||
nt|ralfwil: at last they were. but I don´t think they were agreed|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: partner's suit, and all that|pg||
nt|tihas: they probably would have arrived in 4@h if left to their own devices|pg||
nt|henryb: gee. I would get to 2@h|pg||
nt|tihas: 2@s opening promised a minor, too, so the logical thing would be to look for this minor|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pkl: So any possiblility to win 3@S? There's no legit way, but could Pender perform some kind of magic? I dont believe so|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|toobad: 3d and a s it looks like|pg||
nt|toobad: tick|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|h5|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|viren169: At least we are understanding their system better! Weak NT vs Strong NT both with 4-card majs!|pg||

nt|viren169: and lots of bidding!|pg||
pc|c5|nt|toobad: no h through now|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jallerton: The 3-3 fit doesn't play well on this deal.  -300 off perhaps|pg||
pc|d9|nt|tihas: basically he was hoping that ops would cash their 5 club tricks and there would be pressure in the end to create the 8th trick|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h6|nt|jcomyn: should be -800|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s7|pc|h4|nt|capercliff: wonder why declarer decided to pitch @c rather than @s|pg||

nt|steshome: Hello all|pg||
nt|jallerton: Your commentators are Ian Crorie, Martin Garvey and Sarah Teshome|pg||
nt|idc: Hi everyone, and Jeffrey & Sarah|pg||
nt|idc: the garve is late, as usual :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/lmteams.htm for system cards|pg||
nt|idc: I'm afraid we don't have published systems for the English team, so we'll either need to guess|pg||
nt|steshome: A slam to start with!|pg||
nt|jallerton: or some of them anyway|pg||
nt|idc: or use the encyclopedic knowledge of Sarah and Jeffrey |pg||
nt|viren169: Now a great hand...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4H  normal|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah minor slam good|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: wow, grandy time|pg||
nt|henryb: 13 on top with no finesses|pg||
nt|mdgraham: always interesting to see how pairs cope with this kind of deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: 2@d Multi|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and a c lead to cause problems|pg||
mb|2D|nt|pkl: Yes - 4@H looks like a nice contract. And no problems with both majors behaving|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@D would have made it difficult for Kelly!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that got what it deserved|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3NT or 4S?|pg||
nt|toobad: 3n|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I like 2@d on E. I have seen many players bid 1@s on E here om BBO|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes awful isnt it|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: What about 3@s on W?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|idc: Due to normal first round start-up glitches, we've missed a few boards, but with luck|pg||
nt|jallerton: I believe that EW play 5-card majors, strong NT, possibly also 2@d opener 18-19 balanced.|pg||
nt|capercliff: do they have more than one way to show? If not 2@h is pretty tame|pg||
nt|thegarve:  looks a bit too defensive and no ruffing value for a vul 2S|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3NT is the best chance of game EW|pg||
nt|idc: East hand is borderline try I guess - playing with me it's not but lots of vul weak twos will give play for game|pg||
nt|thegarve:  2NT hre surely?|pg||
nt|capercliff: I would have thought|pg||
nt|jallerton: I think they may be playing 2 ranges of weak 2|pg||
nt|jallerton: this being the weaker variety|pg||
nt|capercliff: so this is the rubbish one?|pg||
nt|pkl: You are contemplating the fourth club by N? Will it cause problems?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well I cant see anyway S will lead a C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: And I dont like Blackwood with a void!|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: East's minors don't make 4M look attractive but 3NT is a possibility|pg||
nt|jcomyn: you MIGHT get away with it in the club on a Monday night|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Peter Goodman|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Peter |pg||
mb|6D|nt|petepunt: hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: I expected a little more bidding on this hand... perhaps the girls are running out of steam!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Hi peter|pg||
nt|toobad: what nt are ns playing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Wales probably just picked up a nice score on the last hand |pg||
nt|jcomyn: well done competent bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and without a @c lead, E must not find @dQ - @hJ is falling|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that 3-0 is annoying though|pg||
pc|cT|nt|toobad: hmm|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ralfwil: best contract|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tihas: S moght just check for the aces and hope that there must be good chances to create enough tricks. It deos not necessarily take a lot of science to bid such grands|pg||
nt|jcomyn: aand thats that|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|henryb: 5N should find the @cK|pg||
nt|diumraid: ****  LIVE LADY MILNE  SCORES ****  IN RUNNING ****   N-IRELAND 34, IRELAND 32, SCOTLAND 31, ENGLAND 30, CBAI 30, WALES 23|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not if 3T makes|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petepunt: saw the swings and roundabouts,  many would overcall 2@S,  but vul was wrong|pg||
pc|cK|nt|thegarve:  only 1 off so no big deal|pg||
nt|jallerton: sharp double from E|pg||
nt|idc: the Scottish ladies have done a lot of protecting this match|pg||
nt|ralfwil: It cannot be difficult to find the @d in the defence|pg||
pc|c8|nt|idc: I think they may have been playing too much pairs|pg||
nt|idc: mind you, any pairs is too much|pg||
nt|jcomyn: must lead small from W|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: missed next door - poor effort|pg||
pc|sA|nt|toobad: 3 on ice on that lead|pg||
pc|s2|nt|capercliff: maybe N felt 41c had play, but very risky|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@c|pg||
nt|capercliff: this might drift 2 off actually|pg||
nt|thegarve:  might well have made kx of @d is a good holding|pg||
nt|thegarve:  East will cash out|pg||
nt|capercliff: is there any hurry?|pg||
nt|idc: well, one way to try for -2 is cash out then @s ruff & discard|pg||
nt|capercliff: partner has to have something to open 2@d, if not a lot|pg||
nt|idc: declarer's trump position starts to look fragile - though as the cards lie she should escape ok|pg||
nt|thegarve:  people get worried in a doubled contracr and like to see the finishing line|pg||
pc|c9|nt|henryb: lazy bidding by N in the other room|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|capercliff: if E doesnt cash out, there is a problem with entries|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good start|pg||
nt|toobad: lead shd mean Kd first|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcomyn: board 2 2S played both ways|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|idc: good - high @s to show something in @h|pg||
nt|jallerton: @sJ suit preference for @h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: gone now|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thought she would ruff a S|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h3|pc|dK|nt|ralfwil: Now she is down. There is a small indication - only 2@c on S|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like it is very close at the top|pg||
nt|jcomyn: of course NON-vul v Vul|pg||
nt|petepunt: sheila shea, liz commins,  patricai kelly, sandra newell  for specs who asked|pg||
nt|toobad: why wd someone look for a ruff with no trump?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|toobad: first blood|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I think NI will be in game in open room|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and both -2!|pg||
pc|h7|nt|toobad: me too|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|mc|11|nt|jcomyn: no I thought W would ruff back to her hand and lead small D|pg||
nt|toobad: a clear error from E there|pg||

nt|mdgraham: veyr much so - plenty of room to find out more.Gave poor South no chance.|pg||
nt|idc: is there a flood to come then?|pg||
nt|pkl: Hey... that was eleven tricks, I presume?|pg||
nt|viren169: Now the dreaded 4441 hand!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but 4s this time|pg||
nt|viren169: Pass or open here?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t think E will lead a @s against 3nt. too risky|pg||
mb|1S|nt|idc: we'll be able to catch up on the results of them later (open the Movie box at the bottom right)|pg||
nt|pkl: I'd pass - also if the K was in clubs|pg||
nt|petepunt: a weak 2@S or not ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not for me |pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  2 by 2s|pg||
nt|idc: to follow the two by two I mean|pg||
nt|viren169: More difficult if North had opened...|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
nt|jcomyn: no not headed by J|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and W will take off|pg||
nt|sybarra: its not even as if the suit is solid to the J |pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like a multi on N|pg||
mb|1N|nt|petepunt: fav vul,  1st or3rd.  but still tempted in 2nd|pg||
mb|p|nt|tihas: still, N had described balanced hand and driven to slam, so there was a case of adding one more for the road, because S actually hadnt shown a lot in the bidding|pg||
nt|tihas: but its tough at the table to do so|pg||
nt|henryb: 1@d = less than 16 points, no 5 card or longer major|pg||
nt|tihas: I think N with balanced hand should have constrained to showing his values|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jallerton: strong NT|pg||
nt|viren169: Border line for me... |pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: NS play Acol, weak NT, Multi 2@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont criticize the bid, its just not my style |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: too difficult - if partner jumps to the six-level, he should know what he is doing |pg||
nt|steshome: I thought E/W were playing a weak NT, but we might have a chance to find out soon|pg||
nt|jallerton: S had an interesting decision: pass, double, 3@h or 2NT|pg||
nt|idc: Fearless protecting at teams, vul v not|pg||
nt|petepunt: south had tough bids,  final pass seems about right|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: my sentiments - that leaves D out of it God gave us 12pts to open|pg||
nt|jcomyn: okay SK but 4-card H|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: now S has to bid 3@h|pg||
nt|toobad: with only 2 clubs and no diamonds, South would have 11 major suit cards!!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: too true|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jallerton: Oh yes, I think you are right, Sarah.  Their 1NT rebid is 15-17!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats what the 2S did - keep opps out of trouble|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but why 3S by W|pg||
nt|sybarra: could only get in so much trouble in @D |pg||
nt|jcomyn: and didnt bid over 2D so bound to have a relatively balanced hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pkl: God does not play bridge - according to Niels Bohr, he doesn't even roll dices|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jallerton: trump switch now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and the minors well placed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t agree with this bidding. As I play N has shown a minimum|pg||
nt|jcomyn: still has a squeak - not a loud one but a squeak|pg||
pc|h8|nt|idc: Stockdale might have put a red card on this, but she may have been worried about getting blood on her dress :)|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes I was wondering if double was a possibility.  Still time for a trump switch|pg||
nt|jallerton: looks as though E is trying to put W in to get a ruff (or two if partner has @sK10x|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think 3 @S to keep n/s out of minor suit partial '|pg||
nt|petepunt: prob 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now N has got a chance. |pg||
nt|jcomyn: no ralf the other way|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or S!|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|capercliff: was the 10 from J10 or K10|pg||
nt|viren169: No... but Gad does!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: they play 3C as good in H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: My lead had been a @s|pg||
nt|toobad: CBAI are also in 3h EW on board 18|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe she thought D were 1.5 1.5|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but isnt He the Supreme Dealer|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|jallerton: or stiff 10|pg||
nt|capercliff: indeed|pg||
nt|steshome: Sorry I'm late|pg||
nt|capercliff: and that is why the 9 was right|pg||
nt|thegarve:  now  a red suit finesse or cash the safe 7|pg||
nt|jallerton: Welcome back to Sarah Teshome|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|jallerton: W not interested in gaining the lead - wants partner to lead trumps through|pg||
pc|h6|nt|petepunt: yes if W passes North will leb to 3@D|pg||
nt|toobad: replicating their NS pair here|pg||
pc|h5|nt|henryb: looks like 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|jallerton: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2008MindSportGamesBeijing%5CSystems/U-28/England/SusanStockdale_FionaBrown.pdf|pg||
nt|jallerton: is convention card for EW|pg||
nt|idc: Great detective work Jeffrey, thx|pg||
nt|jallerton: as long as they haven't changed too much in the last six months!|pg||
nt|idc: The early boards in this match have been quite swingy|pg||
nt|idc: we don't know results at this table, but at the Open, England seem to have missed 3 slams in 5 boards|pg||
nt|idc: This hand should be some IMPs in the bag for England though|pg||
nt|petepunt: Leninsohl is used after T/O doubles to avoid getting to high when u are weak.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|s7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|thegarve:  hi Sarah|pg||
nt|capercliff: the Scots now with a small lead, at least one Scottish team needs to beat the English this year:)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|thegarve:  a low @d and a bit of worry now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a Leb 2NT then by S would make life awkward after 1D X|pg||
pc|s4|nt|thegarve:  duck and declarer is squeezed|pg||
nt|idc: ahha, well spotted|pg||
nt|idc: I predict ... she's wishing she'd cashed out now|pg||
nt|capercliff: nice play the small @d|pg||
nt|jcomyn: apparently 3C is good in either major|pg||

mb|p|nt|idc: If 1@c could be 11-13 bal, probably not|pg||
nt|jallerton: No, sorry to mislead you earlier, 1@c was natural or 15-17 balanced|pg||
nt|idc: but since that isn't what they play, i probably would|pg||
nt|steshome: Is that lead right?|pg||
nt|capercliff: ive never understood playing 1N natural here, but I suppose these days opp open and respond with anything|pg||
nt|capercliff: and N certainly has @h stopped|pg||
nt|thegarve:  as East was a passed hand|pg||
nt|pkl: Ouch. |pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4 matches tomorrow|pg||
mb|2S|nt|petepunt: 1n 15-17, 2@C c/b|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after 1nt-opening both hands have a @d lead in defence|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is it?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no penalty X any more|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: West consults system file for "Interference over Blackwood" section |pg||
nt|jallerton: It's a logical lead; E thinks that declarer has @cJxxx and partner may have a singleton|pg||
nt|idc: A lot like to play 2H natural there, so that would be an option|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and made|pg||
mb|4S|nt|tihas: in desperate times like these, E might actually consider bidding 7@h all by himself after partner launches blackwood|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes reasonable shot|pg||
nt|capercliff: could it hurt to get count in @c first?|pg||
nt|jallerton: not a great success here, however.  I think a top club would be found by most people (rightly or wrongly)|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes I agree|pg||
nt|capercliff: good lead for the defence|pg||
nt|petepunt: may have upgraded S to 18-19 an drebid 2n|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: good thing declarer doesnt have 7 top tricks now|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, Cliff, is partner has a singleton club|pg||
nt|viren169: Wales are giving Eire a ahead strart before they get going... |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: for me 1nt on W is too weak 11 HP and two 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: yes too stroing with two bullets|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and this is not nice at all|pg||
nt|toobad: EW off in 3nt played from the west hand on board 19, so another plus to NI|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: 6@H+1 may be EW's best result. NS likely to save over a seven bid|pg||
nt|jallerton: she can finesse in @H|pg||
nt|capercliff: but will still roll home with 3-2@h and 3-3@s|pg||
nt|jallerton: should be OK with @s 3-3 and @dA onside|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes|pg||
nt|petepunt: suits dont break well|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jallerton: and W cannot get in to lead a low @d|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the best possible result, rather than the best result possible :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If you are in 4@h and @s is lead, you will make!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely cant pass 3H bid thats bold Mary Madden|pg||
pc|sT|nt|thegarve:  East cannot get West in to play the pressure low @d|pg||
nt|petepunt: W figures to hold at least 5@D here so may guess @Hs right (vacant spaces)|pg||
nt|petepunt: however, may prefer to play on @S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: choices choices I hate them|pg||
nt|petepunt: if @S a @C swith will defeat i think|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jallerton: well done|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|sybarra: with hts not breaking ......|pg||
nt|toobad: 2d was going for a number, wires badly crossed|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|capercliff: chances of stiff @c are less than giving away the contract no?|pg||

pc|s4|nt|steshome: Oh well it was a thoughtful lead as you say Jeffrey|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|viren169: If 4@C is NF... North has to start with a dble...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I  noticed this in the first session - there are no penalty doubles on lower levels today!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: as I mentioned earlier whats wrong with leaving 2D X in - it is not a disaster if it happens to make|pg||
pc|hA|nt|viren169: Not easy...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pkl: North has a fantastic hand after 3@D. If anything, she could bid 4@H as slam invitational.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c5|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.cbai.ie/  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In 60 series England has won on 46 occasions, Scotland on 9, Wales won three times and Northern Ireland twice. The Republic of Ireland, joining the series in 1998, has yet to win|pg||
nt|idc: i prefer 3NT by North after a 15-17 NT |pg||
nt|thegarve:    4@Sor 3NT - looks like all the hands with singleton and voids were used up in the last set|pg||
nt|capercliff: my predictions living up to the bill|pg||
nt|idc: SHould make on power when a bad trump split might doom 4@s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hmm|pg||
nt|petepunt: interestin what u should play 2@s as here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: For the first time we have six teams taking part. The sixth spot goes to the host, this year Ireland. They are represented by two teams: Republic of Ireland and CBAI (Contract ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bridge Association of Ireland)|pg||
nt|jallerton: not with 5-3 clubs...|pg||

nt|jcomyn: 2H and leave it there|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jallerton: Maybe, Sarah, although the minor suit jacks help to make 6@h so good|pg||
nt|steshome: Roland you heard your name being taken in vain! We think you would be in 7@h on this one|pg||
nt|pkl: Oh - that D is obvious with my glasses on|pg||
nt|pkl: Ah - perhaps not.... *shining glasses*|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: I would rather be in 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Without any doubt|pg||
nt|idc: EW or NS?|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Looks like N/S are on their way to 4@H|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Union sends one team to represent the island of Ireland|pg||
nt|capercliff: interesting is that you kinda need both finesses to make 6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How many times did you win the LM, Sarah?|pg||
nt|capercliff: but 8x@d is helpful|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe she lost count|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You using your toes too?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|steshome: I don't know Roland.  I think six?|pg||
nt|viren169: I think 3@H is enough with Marray's hand, 2@S seems to be over stating their hand...|pg||
nt|petepunt: good to play 2@H as about 8-10 and 3@S and 2@S as 5-7 ?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|henryb: tricky thing is not to touch @d and keep E from getting endplayed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: six is correct|pg||
nt|capercliff: is West worth another try?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Ah, so Roland was just testing!|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe 4@s?|pg||
nt|idc: I wonder if they have agreements over the dbl - would pass by East have been more serious try for example?|pg||
nt|idc: maybe it would just have shown some sort of control and 4@c denies one|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jallerton: pass might just sho interest with no convenient cue|pg||
nt|jallerton: show|pg||
nt|viren169: Now a @C leads is marked...|pg||
pc|d8|nt|steshome: On this layout, yes - but both contracts cold so no problem|pg||

nt|jcomyn: nooooo|pg||

nt|viren169: Only 8 tricks available on a @C lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|henryb: they will not succeed|pg||
nt|henryb: on defense|pg||
nt|idc: my opponents don't even need solid stuff outside - last weekend they had Qx opposite Txx|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now is is 12|pg||
pc|h3|nt|viren169: General force looking for 3N I guess... not sure why?!?!|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
nt|idc: I've missed lots of better slams than this one, so no shame in playing game|pg||

nt|othered1: with kind splits, this is no problem|pg||

nt|capercliff: @s|pg||
nt|jallerton: What's your idea of a bad game, Cliff?|pg||
nt|idc: agree Sarah - it might look daring but much less dangerous than some of the protective bids they *have* been making|pg||
nt|idc: and a much bigger potential upside|pg||
nt|steshome: I see that Fiona gained 4 for passing the transfer on the previous board|pg||
nt|capercliff: well we can see all hands, after 1@h the K@d has a good chance of being right|pg||
nt|capercliff: also 2-2 @s not unreasonable|pg||
nt|jallerton: but you need both and even then need to get a trick out of clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzms: director called to table, dummy put hand down before n made bid|pg||
nt|capercliff: that reuires the Q with West |pg||
nt|capercliff: requires|pg||

nt|capercliff: but regardless, do you really want to defend 4@h?|pg||

nt|othered1: Not sure what the auction meant, but contract is normal and good.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possibly 3@H=clubs|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|idc: The only chance is if North forgets she isn't playing v men and leans forward too much and exposes her hand|pg||
nt|capercliff: as it happens a @h lead and @s shift is better|pg||
nt|steshome: England gaining 11 on the previous board when the Scots fail to beat 4@h|pg||
nt|thegarve:  T@s and then when playing a @D toward dummy duck the card from South|pg||

nt|toobad: NI made 2N up 1 on board 28 for a gain of 10 and 1N up one on 27 for a gain of 5|pg||
nt|jcomyn: N will bid D and then S has no option|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|steshome: I think they had a suit preference misunderstanding.  Costly.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nothing like good neighbours to help out|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: the 31c bid worked on brd 12, England were aloowed to play in 2@s|pg||

nt|capercliff: 2@s was makeable, even on the good defence we saw here|pg||
nt|idc: The @s2 discard - expect you have it right Sarah|pg||
nt|viren169: Good pass by Kelly|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes - no option now but 3nt|pg||
mb|4C|nt|viren169: Some would inv with 8 and 5-card suit...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: include me|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ????|pg||
nt|jcomyn: where to now - rudderless at this stage|pg||
mb|4D|nt|capercliff: yes 4@s looks clear after 2@s, but im not sure im a fan of the 2@s to start with|pg||
nt|pkl: ... and with a heart lead there's eight tricks. At least ;-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: looks like 2NT=transfer to diamonds. |pg||
nt|idc: What do I know?   3@c seems to have worked out well|pg||
nt|jallerton: East was not anticipating that pass|pg||
nt|jallerton: West's pass is perhaps a little pessimistic - could still have game on with AAKK and 3-card support|pg||
nt|idc: I might bid 3@s - or do you prefer 1@s Cliff?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  that from a man who In the last set of the Camrose, Cliff had the pleasure of bidding on all 16 boards- frequently with zip|pg||
nt|capercliff: 1@s|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe only 15 Martin|pg||
nt|capercliff: this contract looks safe, but we have seen 1@h go down earlier|pg||
nt|jcomyn: s opens on a 9-count, E passes with 10 hmm|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ouch stop please|pg||
nt|ralfwil: soon will the reds appear|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely |pg||
nt|toobad: on that last board 29 the CBAI are in 3c EW|pg||

nt|ralfwil: And I´m talking about flat biards.... bah..|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzme: this is the last board|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@C can be used to show bad diamond support, and 3@D shows ok diamonds|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can use the same over 2@S if this is a transfer to clubs|pg||

nt|capercliff: squeeze for 12 tricks here?|pg||
nt|idc: I watched N Ireland bid this at the start of the session|pg||
nt|jallerton: 6NT can be made on a strip squeeze here|pg||
nt|idc: Caira Burns did indeed make 6NT on a @c lead by that method|pg||
nt|jallerton: 6@C is better but hard to reach I suspect|pg||
nt|steshome: And on other lines.  Mind you 6@c is easier|pg||
nt|idc: not sure it was best % line but can't argue with success|pg||
nt|steshome: Oh well.  |pg||
nt|pkl: 4@H anyone?|pg||
nt|viren169: Pender may make it difficult for North|pg||
nt|viren169: but may get caught in the process!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Is that all Ralf  bah|pg||
nt|jcomyn: if 6D had made NI would be in 3-figures this half alone|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: Hi Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzme: This is the final round. So far the standings are: Monte Carlo (356), Roheline Lammas (343), Druva (342,5), Eksprompt (338), Rakvere (313), Derpt (249), Otepää (222), Pärnu BK3 ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzme: (201).|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Your commentators for this match are Henry Bethe and Ed Shapiro (USA). I am Mike Graham (England).  |pg||
nt|idc: My theory: if you are gong to bother looking for a 4-4 @s fit with the North hand|pg||
nt|steshome: Still up though ...|pg||
nt|viren169: I think 3@C is enough with that hand...|pg||
mb|1D|nt|capercliff: weak NT might be a success on this deal|pg||
nt|jcomyn: danger of bidding a game they might not bid otherwise|pg||
mb|1S|nt|capercliff: they are going to 6|pg||
nt|idc: and most would, how can it not be even better to look for a @c fit too?|pg||
nt|viren169: too many doubletons for me...|pg||
nt|viren169: Now is that values or take-out?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now 3NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what can she be thinking about|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good job the old minus is gone|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: Our operaor is Raul Laasner (Estonia). |pg||
mb|2S|nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|vugraphzme: welcome everyone|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@s vul vs not is braver than I would be|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South knew what to expect, though |pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: 3N from S is never getting a @c lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: well done|pg||
nt|capercliff: 6@c is a fine bid|pg||
nt|steshome: I don't know why 6@c is difficult to reach|pg||
nt|capercliff: now just to make it|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2NT 3-card raise again|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nice game EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: 12 imps coming to Scotland|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like take-out|pg||
nt|jcomyn: missed abroad as well|pg||
pc|dT|nt|capercliff: and 41s requires declarer to get everything right|pg||
nt|capercliff: @s|pg||
nt|viren169: and West survives to tell the tale...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes I critisize my opinion about the ´boards - flat - NO|pg||
nt|jcomyn: we are seeing Republic ladies bridge being buried in the cruellest fashion due entirely to appalling bridge. I have to say that and the ladies can scream if they like|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: West neatly (and rightly) avoided a 2-suited overcall.|pg||
nt|jallerton: that looks like the best lead|pg||
nt|thegarve:  can't be 4th highest from honour|pg||
nt|capercliff: I suspect this will drift 1 off|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes it's a good lead.|pg||
nt|capercliff: hoping my usual predictions are wrong of course:)|pg||

nt|jcomyn: Goodman. Lively stuff and good hands|pg||
nt|petepunt: ... that u can then hold up @H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|thegarve:  its from xxx so no trump lead suggests qxx @s|pg||
pc|h4|nt|henryb: I wonder whether a less brave call, such as pass, would have led to E-W missing this game|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|capercliff: not necessarily Martin|pg||
nt|steshome: If you say so|pg||
nt|viren169: all routes lead to 10 tricks... on hooking the @H|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jcomyn: Anyway folks one to go for the day, so once again Thanks to Paul Porteus and CBAI and to Eamonn Galligan on his accordion. Alkso John Murchan and Ralf Rilquist for a job ...|pg||

nt|petepunt: a let off|pg||
nt|jcomyn: too true|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s3|nt|jallerton: depends on the opening lead style of this particular West|pg||
nt|thegarve:  when in two-way Q situations build up your clues|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|h7|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jcomyn: phew|pg||
