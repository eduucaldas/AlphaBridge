mb|4C|nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stayman was not out of the question|pg||
nt|athene: not only is it safe, but east gets to make two discards which might be helpful|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you were right in a way about the auction Bill. it was passed out. after the opening bid, that is :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes, stayman was a possibility with the north hand (intending to pass any rebid from opener)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: south is bidding a lot|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Your commentators are Marshall Lewis and William Frisby|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Player names please operator|pg||
nt|athene: south has a very nice hand, even if she doesn't have a name yet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: usually they make it through a few hands before they play anonymously|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: i can think of people who would open 2@C on that south hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|roswolf: a feisty auction and i am not sure whether this will be an objectively good result for the declaring side|pg||
nt|col3435: yes, how does 4@h do?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S plays well. but 1NT can make also|pg||
nt|col3435: seems to me like it might come in|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|athene: yes, there is the double heart finesse for declarer if she chooses to take it|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it may well but will e/w get there in the other room? n/s bidding i think helped|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|col3435: I'd say West always had enough to bid 4@h after East had raised|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Let's suppose North cashed a top club and then switched to the jack of diamonds - quite testing for declarer then |pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: it is all about the first round of hearts and cashing only one diamond before playing hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but she will surely throw a heart here|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d6|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|c7|pc|hJ|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|cJ|pc|hT|nt|athene: well, she would have done if declarer finessed hearts retaining a top diamond in hand|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: sorry *East* gets squeezed|pg||
pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: since S needs heart king on regardless, the choice is between 3-3 diamonds and heart ten being onside. the latter is more likely|pg||

nt|werge: A good guesser might mahe a lot of tricks E/W in a @S-contract|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mmmakela: this looks interesting|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: bet in 5-level pretty quickly|pg||
nt|werge: 6 @S is lay-down double-dummy|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mariner1: 5@S makes, 6@H is a save IF they can drop the K@C, a Rabbi would.........|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mariner1: Rabbi's Rule = when the king is singleton play the Ace|pg||
nt|mmmakela: even being vul 3 @H very tame|pg||
nt|werge: West has a good hand - after N/S´s @D-bidding|pg||
nt|chick: at this vul, NS can't even take the @D sacrifice|pg||
nt|phil: even 4@d is too expensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: They are allready at 500|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: wow!|pg||
nt|werge: 6 @S is better|pg||
nt|chick: choice of slam bid|pg||
nt|werge: A bad decision to bid slam - N/S have indicated bad breaks|pg||
nt|phil: note that South is going to be endplayed after winning the @cK, which will negate one of the guesses - assuming declarer takes the time to eliminate diamonds|pg||

nt|marlowepi: zia for example|pg||
nt|athene: yes but 3-3 diamonds has the extra chance of a squeeze|pg||
nt|marlowepi: my comment refers to how to discrd from dummy on the spades|pg||
nt|athene: which would have worked there|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 7nt here for N-S if they want it enough....bringing in AK9 / J10xxxx isn't bad odds for a grand|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: what is everyone thinking about?|pg||
nt|athene: dummy doesn't have what West is hoping for in 4@S|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwww|pg||
nt|athene: although if north leads her partner's suit that will help|pg||
nt|athene: ouch|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: very hard to disagnose though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E took a real chance here...|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: north was doing the thinking :) i doubt east had to think too hard about that one|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: i might have bid something over 1@C as east|pg||
mb|p|nt|sn00py27: I thought we might get an idea on this hand whether they play weak or strong NT :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In these times many East's would open - especially with an eye on the vulnerability|pg||
nt|sn00py27: E/W|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this should be easy enough|pg||
pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: probably better to play in 7D. at least you go off only one when diamonds break your heart|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D must be showing something like north's hand - and south ought to be getting mildly excited|pg||
nt|col3435: some convention cards at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/lmteams.htm|pg||
nt|col3435: N/S play "Acol with 5-card majors and a strong NT"|pg||
nt|col3435: E/W card isn't there but I think they play strong+5 too|pg||
nt|sn00py27: Not quite Acol then !|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: the aces will take care of partner's @H+@C losers, however those two cards are split|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|col3435: well, yes. Seems like a contradiction in terms to me. But that's what they say.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: @SJ10 might be useful fillers...@DAK9 is great|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: understandable that NS are hoping to create some action given the match score. but that 5C bid is infinitely more likely to widen the gap than to close it|pg||
nt|athene: East will be disappointed to get only her top trumps from here|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: admittedly you don't want to bid a grand slam when there is a chance they might not reach the small slam in the other room|pg||
pc|d9|nt|marlowepi: i am puzzled why N did not respond 2D|pg||
nt|athene: a 6-card minor is shorter than a 5-card major, for most people, these days|pg||
nt|col3435: (it probably just means "not 2/1 GF")|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: i am sorry to say|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: EW would probably get another trick if W continued spades, but that is not too likely|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: but there is more to it than that. 2D has the advantage of announcing strength immediately also|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: i think with all those keycards for diamonds, south should not stop below 6@D after north bids 4@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suppose N was concerned about a rebid of 2H from S. but is 2D GF ion their methods? not normally in these countries, is it?|pg||
nt|athene: well, i don't know N-S's methods, but i am assuming Acol-ish, so things tend not to be forcing :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think both N and S are guilty of underbidding here|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 1NT is comfortable, might be a more interesting deal if East opens |pg||

nt|bobh1: he probably figured--"why didn't he strip the hand?" . . . |pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: 6 @C seems to be lay-down. South is end-played after ruffing @D - and he must "give" away the @H-suit. Now it looks like a show-up squeeze against North - and that will tell, who ...|pg||
nt|werge: is in position of the cricial @S Queen|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 5@C DBL made so a big swing to Galim|pg||
nt|werge: crucial|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|phil: looks like 4@s which will depend on guessing the club Q (or maybe a misdefense)|pg||
nt|werge: You get an extra @C-trick, if South plays ruff and discard|pg||
nt|werge: As always: 3 NT is the contract...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: yes, 3N is excellent|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|bobh1: declarer followed the Zia Bols Bridge tip of many years ago--if they don't cover, they don't have it|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mmmakela: 3 NT little stretchy, 2 NT enough imo|pg||
nt|mariner1: likely is down,,,,,, 3@H 1@D and 1@C to lose|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mcarroll: yes avoid the 6-4 fit|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|phil: only the commentators can reach it however, in real life, everyone plays 4@s :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|mcarroll: And now it all depends on finding @CQ|pg||
nt|werge: This is tricky, two rounds of @S - and a @D, this will bring E/W in trouble|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mmmakela: see the heart spots Rob|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d9|nt|phil: I think East needs to rise with the K@d early|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh I missed one... right,,,,,,,,, 2@H to lose|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True - give up the lead in @D and the opps have to help declarer|pg||
nt|werge: When East rises with the @D K, declarer will know - from the NOT-lead, where the @D Ace is -. and make the contract, West is endplyed|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|mcarroll: Sorry give a @H|pg||
pc|sK|nt|phil: lose heart, diamond to King, diamond to Jack - if declarer plays for split diamonds, he can claim|pg||
nt|phil: right, strong inference on the non-diamond lead|pg||
nt|werge: He KNOWS, that they split - from the (I repeat) NOT-lead of a high @D|pg||

nt|chessmaste: Not a great line - there was an easy overtrick avalable|pg||
nt|roswolf: a 20/20 hcp hand - how high will e/w go?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Roland would like this - a 20/20 deal|pg||
mb|1C|nt|marlowepi: that is the humnan reality, true, though in international matches one is more or less expected to overcome those foibles|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: N should not have that worry when S cues 5C|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would be tempted to bid 2@C over 1@H with East |pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: east doubled 1@D intending to bid spades next and show a strong hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has announced a strong NT, and six is cold facing both round aces and diamond KQ, which is only 13|pg||
nt|chessmaste: South might protect |pg||

mb|3H|nt|athene: hmmm this auction seems illogical|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: either South or West probably bid 1@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you dont want a spade lead from Txxxx or some rubbish against 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: maybe N simply did the multiplication and made the bid that would complete the equation|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3@H I don't care for|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: many pairs have ways to distinguish a good 2H raise from a nuisance raise over doublke|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H might be a much weaker hand - it would be useful to have 2@D available as a good 3-card raise|pg||

mb|1S|nt|athene: 1@D 1@H 1@S 1N by NS uncontested, perhaps|pg||

mb|d|nt|tejjyid: OK, not any more|pg||
mb|2C|nt|marlowepi: not that it is likely with 3 in each major and a mediocre suit and adverse colors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, that is the easiest way to survive a misguess in trumps....stay low:)|pg||
nt|athene: really 4@H? or are we just skipping to the final contract?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: safety play against wimping out later|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|athene: i expected 1@D to silence West :) but she was not so easily silenced!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrth thinks 4@H is fit showing|pg||
nt|athene: responding 4@H at your first turn with that south hand expresses doubt as to partner's constructive bidding, i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: south's off shape double may complicate matters for everyone|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: more likely north was scared it was a splinter?|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|marlowepi: what is E worth if W can't double 1D but did anyway? most systems don;t cover that :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3@H will endplay partner - why not 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: but my book recommends transfers after the opponent's to doubles as an alternative|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: Even with 13 penalty cards, this would be a tough hand to make|pg||

nt|marlowepi: in regard to an earlier comment, the Italian Blue Team was famous for the success of their off-shape takeout doubl;es|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: N's eyes may fall out on the next round of diamonds when she sees who fails|pg||

nt|athene: she knows her partner has nothing, more or less|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: 4@H might actually have been the only making game?|pg||
nt|athene: a good example of how you want the weaker hand's long suit to be trumps|pg||

pc|s5|nt|mcarroll: I have much the same attitude to Drury as Roland has to the F convention|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|phil: wow, really? I have a partner that feels the same, but I think its key|pg||
nt|chick: Drury is the second worst convention ever invented imho :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||

nt|marlowepi: give. the successes of "tactical underbidding" are measly compared to those of the red-blooded philosophy|pg||
nt|athene: sorry the diamonds were a bit weaker than i thought|pg||
nt|athene: i thought declarer had the @D9|pg||
nt|athene: it wasn't a trivial hand|pg||
nt|athene: but starting with @DA means you are usually going to lose two tricks in the suit|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Roland asked us to be very kind - did he have inside information?|pg||
nt|henryb: calling it a comedy seems to me to be kind!|pg||
nt|col3435: I liked Henry's underlead at trick two, that's a much classier way to let it through :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: NO just experience!|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|athene: 6nt or 6@C here i guess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S rightly promotes her hand to a 2NT rebid|pg||
nt|athene: a diamond lead might worry you in 6nt a bit - 6@C looks better|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 21 HCP but far better than that due to long chunky suit and all primes|pg||
nt|tejjyid: need to enlist the defence to help|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: on the @D10 lead, in 6NT, you probably play east for the @DK @SQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: maybe just return a @H after trick one|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: win @DA, run everything, and throw east in to lead a spade|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Yes, I asked commentators to treat the players with respect. I will stand by that view at all times whether you like it or not|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@H is an underbid by some way i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: maybe not|pg||
nt|athene: need another pass in there|pg||
nt|tejjyid: check please operator|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: and west gave them another chance|pg||
nt|sn00py27: I would dbl 2@C|pg||
nt|sn00py27: playing 4cd majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: north in the other room bid3@C |pg||
nt|roswolf: A GAME SWING IN TO ENGLAND|pg||
nt|sn00py27: if these are 5CM, I think 3@C with those good cards|pg||
nt|roswolf: makes the score more respectable|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: on a non-diamond lead, you just play @SAK and another, probably|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe---that line is transparent enough that--IN PRINCIPLE--E can make you guess whether or not the spades are now stiff queen (after spade ace)|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what was 2S?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|diumraid: ******  In Running Scores ******* -  LIVE from LIMERICK ********-   N-Ireland 20, CBAI 17, ENGLAND 16, SCOTLAND 14, IRELAND 13, WALES 10|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: i assumed it was some number of controls|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS live right. this dreadful contract is cold|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D = 0-1 control, 2@H = 2, 2@S = 3?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Having bid 2@H on the first round North might have recovered with a subtle 3@D on the next|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: (A=2, K=1)|pg||
nt|athene: but south obviously thought it was natural|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: 6@S isn't all that bad|pg||
nt|marlowepi: If I ended up in 6S making on this layout, I would ask the opps if we could just score it as 1370 instead of 1430, so we could tell our teammates we played in 6C. it would be worth ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the lost 2 IMPs|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: 3-3 spades, @SQx, @SQxxx onside|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so, from QT96, duck was correct...|pg||
nt|athene: the @H6 couldn't be from @HQ1096 but it might have been @HQ106 or @HQ96 i suppose|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: excellent compared to our usual slams Bill, but the right frame of comparison is vis a vis 6C|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c4|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c6|nt|athene: surely the @H10 would be led from @HQ109(x)?|pg||
nt|henryb: Is 3@d valus in @d or a suggestion of an alternative contract?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chessmaste: Although England have played modestly in this room they are recovering some points at the end of the session|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: plausibly|pg||

nt|mmmakela: 4 hearts very good game|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|chick: by repeated spade finesses?|pg||
nt|henryb: 3N is very pessimistic with N depending on the 2N range.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|phil: for starters, and then squeezing E in the blacks|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|phil: but theres some communication issues|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|henryb: repeated spade finesses and a black suit squeeze|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|mariner1: on 15 S was also unaggressive so the contract is also 3@D|pg||
nt|mariner1: that is in Open|pg||

nt|henryb: 3N, on the other hand, is not terribly challenging|pg||

nt|marlowepi: tricks? S should play back Q of spades hoping for a duck (correct if spades are 5-3), then if N turns up with only four spades (by following up the line), she can shift to diamonds|pg||
