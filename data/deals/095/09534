nt|dan_hohor: of course, they are both hot blooded :) this will do them no good as they must be very tired|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Bill...can we please not talk about cricket.....|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|paulg: nothing too frightening to report so far, i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I won't, but I cannot promise it of one of the other commentators|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: much better the british attitude, relax and go for the next board without a word|pg||
nt|paulg: Good morning everyone|pg||
mb|1N|nt|aupillon: the opening in North is forbidden in the French Alps |pg||
nt|mdgraham: good afternoon all.|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: good competitive board to wake everyone up|pg||
nt|paulg: Both pairs are playing 5-card majors and a strong 1NT|pg||
nt|paulg: Grant and Macdonald need little excuse to bid, as I'm sure we'll see|pg||
nt|paulg: they play 4-card minors and a weak 1NT|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jcomyn: here we have a completly untried partnership representing Ireland - amazing|pg||
nt|aupillon: it's curious. Neither line found their 4/4 major fit |pg||
nt|capercliff: hi folks|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: did he really start with 3 @C ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: SHE|pg||

nt|aupillon: Hi Cliff. I already introduced myself as a French spy...:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: ok now|pg||
nt|paulg: both pairs play 5-card majors and a strong 1NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hello all and welcome back to Limerick|pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulg: another example of how easy it is to lose the club suit these days|pg||
nt|odysseus69: any case for spade to 8 or jack first?|pg||
nt|toobad: no|pg||
nt|paulg: hi Mike|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dan_hohor: I learned this type of attitude here in Aus, but I could never apply it :)|pg||
nt|paulg: lead of the @dQ asks for reverse attitude, although Greenwood might think it's from shortage|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Marian|pg||
nt|mdgraham: big deficit for Wales to attempt to overcome|pg||
nt|paulg: both playing 4-card minors and a weak 1NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Mike fromEngland here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's two of us, then |pg||
nt|lestergold: two Mikes mayv 2 too many|pg||
pc|cA|nt|capercliff: oh I see:)|pg||
nt|aupillon: One does double in East or say 1NT ?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: quick no|pg||
nt|paulg: i think 1NT gets the hand over immediately|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: at least worth a slow no|pg||
nt|toobad: this will take a bit of time now!!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: with what sounded like a 4-4 spade fit not clear that East should start with diamond|pg||
nt|chessmaste: No need to double with a balanced hand|pg||
nt|aupillon: good style. i absolutely agree|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: sorry missed exact bidding on set up|pg||
nt|greerm: the bidding was 1@C 1@H 1nt 2nt|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dan_hohor: if Traian does a mistake , I throw him at least a diry look :) and he does the same if I do a booboo|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|Walddk4: Commentary in Gaelic required in this room (will be nice and quiet then I suspect)|pg||
nt|aupillon: North opening bid impressed me. Not knowing them, is their style VERY agressive ?|pg||
nt|paulg: yes, it is|pg||
nt|aupillon: thank you|pg||

nt|aupillon: How time changes... At first 13, later 12, etc. And now with 10...Getting oldern anyway|pg||
nt|paulg: a quiet hand to get everyone into the match|pg||
nt|lestergold: well more than one way to skin a cat i suppose|pg||
pc|s6|nt|odysseus69: oops|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unenviable choice for West|pg||

nt|aupillon: aha|pg||
nt|lestergold: well west gave an unnecessary overtrick by postponing the evil day|pg||
nt|mdgraham: always annoying to go minus when you hold a 19-count, but the bidding indicated what partner would have |pg||

nt|Walddk5: Good morning Greer and Victor|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good morning all|pg||
mb|d|nt|dan_hohor: uh, I would open strong|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Does 6@D make?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Alexander will pull|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: and 6C looks better as a spec points out|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: she is thinking now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6@C can certainly be beaten!|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You don't defend with that hand|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: if she does not with that hand .....|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: Not the strongest opener in the world from Martin|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, in these days of emaciated openings and wafer-thin responses, you have to bid else you can be stolen blind |pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk5: Undo Traian, please|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In fact, 6@C either makes an overtrick or an undertrick, all depends on the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i lik emaciated|pg||
mb|2H|nt|paulg: but I'm surprised Adamson did not respond 1@s as they appear to rebid 1NT with balanced hands|pg||
nt|lestergold: it fils to descibe myself tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: fails to describe myself|pg||
mb|p|nt|dan_hohor: oh , what a punt from the grand turk |pg||

nt|lethal666: well done to the girls here|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: after X from N why not 6c ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to a person who knows West better than most, Alex Adamson. Sheila is his sister|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It's quite no-trumpy. Would you choose to respond 1@S as West?|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Good morning everyone.|pg||
nt|paulg: hi Alex|pg||
nt|paulg: I'd always respond 1@s although I'd end up in the same place|pg||
nt|paulg: Diana would have ruffed the @h in hand, cashed the @sK and lead the winning club|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry - you are right|pg||
nt|toobad: good morning all|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3nt now|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning John|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dan_hohor: 3 looser hand !|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Because double doesn't suggest anything particular in the minors|pg||
nt|bobholl: doesn't that show a better hand ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: well the right spot|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and maybe inspired D lead???|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: this is not exactly a sleekin' cowrous timrous auction either  |pg||
nt|paulg: seems to have a solid 5 losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: wil just make thanks to @S 8 :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and right to applaud|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: weird|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what accuracy - you cant argue with success|pg||
nt|bobholl: west won't like a 13 in @S@H and a correction to 3@H :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not clear how EW can contest this - perhaps East might double 2@D, but there is no guarantee that they can make anything |pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: a good 4@H to reach when N showed a hand close to an acol 2@H|pg||
pc|c8|nt|odysseus69: no problem for South- knew more than me|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cuttysark: Some would make a 3-card raise with the East hand|pg||
pc|c7|nt|greerm: declare has a choice of winning lines, 2 @H finesses or @D to K|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|h8|nt|cuttysark: Ns have 7 top winners now - the question is, can they unscramble them|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Scotland could play 1NT at both tables.  East is likely to pass in the other room.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Interesting notion that Scotland couls bis more aggressively than NI|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dan_hohor: yes Bill, but 7-5 stay well alive :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade looked standard but only a club would have beaten it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and if pard is 2542, they may have no fit either|pg||
nt|greerm: hoping to sccore 5@H trick and 5 in the blacks|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|bjacobs: Right, but you need to bid on something more than jingles|pg||

nt|jcomyn: Hi folks|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone @H|pg||
nt|rnc: Hi|pg||
nt|jcomyn: John Comyn here While we have the time, let me inform the kibitzers that the Ireland team is changed drastically. Three of the original team of 5 have cried off for one reason and ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another and have been replaced by three members of the team which finished third. Accordingly our B team will be hot favourites here. |pg||
nt|capercliff: but + scores are good|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed but they ae at green so have leeway|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, at 50 down I suppose you are allowed a little latitude|pg||
nt|lestergold: and as u say wont catch up 50 imps by not b idding|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: that was quick|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jcomyn: Grainne Barton, Maria Barry and Valerie Hand are replaced by Patricia Kelly, Sandra Newell and Gilda Pender. Why 5 we will never know|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Sorry, showing my inexperience, perhaps.|pg||
nt|paulg: perhaps Greenwood had actually pitched a spade? Or Adamson cashed the club at the end and not the diamond|pg||
nt|aupillon: maybe on open S hand too|pg||
nt|capercliff: it is E thinking here|pg||
nt|aupillon: I demand political asylum there, to learn this way. It's enchanting, really|pg||
nt|capercliff: not N|pg||
nt|paulg: i bet Lee expected to bid on this hand|pg||
nt|greerm: good mornign John|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk5: Surnames only operator please|pg||
nt|Walddk5: There is not enough room for first names|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ok|pg||
nt|Walddk5: What is South's last name?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: ah, Newell|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just informing the kibitzers|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3NT a possibility|pg||
nt|capercliff: I might have bid 3N rather than X|pg||
nt|aupillon: South opened. How many diamonds now ?|pg||
nt|capercliff: but it is an awkward hand|pg||
nt|aupillon: you can tell this :)|pg||
nt|paulg: might bid 5@d, as partner had 4@c for the majors|pg||
nt|toobad: hi Greer|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks a routine 3NT unless North tries suicidal 4C|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lethal666: im keeping that close to my chest. but i do have a preference|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Very wise.  Because if your preferred team makes it, your opinion would give them particular motivation|pg||
nt|paulg: will south protect?|pg||
nt|toobad: maybe......... but not what we were shown|pg||
nt|greerm: a lot of tricks available to EW if they pick up the @D suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: pretty maximum looking 1NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good 2NT bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: well upgrade for the long diamonds of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: Leigh is a wise captain....|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: looks right to do so|pg||
nt|toobad: that 2c bid should help!!|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jcomyn: Kirby should bid now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and McMahon 4|pg||
nt|chick: once W passed a chance to bid after the double, I'd sure bid more than 2@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Hi Cornelia|pg||
nt|chick: Hi :)|pg||
nt|rnc: East must be delighted to get support here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hate that 1NT by S in teams|pg||
nt|bobholl: what's wrong with 1@D ?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not because you can make anything, but because you might push them up|pg||
nt|paulg: yes, a double followed by a scrambling 2NT would see them find the diamond fit ... and probably push them up|pg||
nt|aupillon: when you bid this way, you have to play well too|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3Cx also costs 5 imps so weak jump could cost|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: and as cards lie infrangible|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they are solid, too - it just takes a bit of time to get to the point where they are solid |pg||
nt|lestergold: unless west plays something offkey|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcomyn: Juxta position in this match. Our B team are favourtites|pg||
nt|bobholl: the old problem with 1@D 2@C :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: south did well to invite - i confess I would have passed|pg||
nt|toobad: 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|paulg: yes, i'd have passed too|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however I would have upgraded the NBorth hand|pg||
nt|paulg: agreed|pg||
nt|paulg: @dQ looks attractive lead now|pg||
nt|toobad: well Ciara knows they are behind in the match, so being pushy and she should be rewarded with a positive result|pg||
nt|paulg: With Guy and Punch sitting N/S in the other room I am not concerned about them missing 3NT here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not solid really - West has to decide how to play the clubs|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|paulg: on the other hand, if partner cannot bid over 1@C ...?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no point in spade lead knowing pd has singleton at most|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chick: Is this your A or B team we are watching?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|chick: or is it your A team morphed into the B?  :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the A team is NS and the B team EW, but our A team was decimated during the week|pg||
nt|jcomyn: only 2 left from the original 5 who won the trials|pg||
nt|toobad: and after Diane's play on board one, strike while you are hot|pg||
nt|odysseus69: of course dummy liable to have 4 diamonds and possibly 5 which explains the delay|pg||
nt|aupillon: Good remark with 3NT reopening Cliff|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|jcomyn: suppose so but the lead helps|pg||

nt|lethal666: Whichever way it goes now in this tight match, Either team will be better for this experiance, while the butler team has had no real practice at all|pg||

pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: why? There are five out|pg||

nt|paulg: actually the odds are on the drop, but not so heavily that playing against the odds when 50 down is a reasonable play to get IMPs back|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|dT|nt|paulg: i think it is the difference between international and club play ... at the club, you'd be afraid that the opponents have missed game and you might push them into it ....|pg||

nt|toobad: 4d  i would hope|pg||
mb|p|nt|dan_hohor: even if 1 ace is the A of @s you might get a spade lead anyhow on the bidding :)|pg||

nt|aupillon: NO ?!|pg||
nt|greerm: not good news for N so it will be up to S to try again|pg||

nt|jcomyn: not me|pg||
nt|lestergold: played by east 6d is an excellent slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I could play one too, but I might not get the notes in the right order  |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: but I would not agree with 1C|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 1NT-1|pg||
nt|paulg: 1@d or 1NT?|pg||
nt|capercliff: i like 1N|pg||

nt|diumraid: ****  IN RUNNING LIVE LADY MILNE ****  IRELAND 34, N-IRELAND 33, SCOTLAND 32, CBAI 32, ENGLAND 28, WALES 21 *****|pg||
nt|lestergold: played by west its better than a roland slam lot better|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I would .. a kib asked me if I'd open 2@C and I said never, it distorts the hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well I would hate 1C P P P|pg||
mb|5H|nt|chick: so would I, but if partner passed 1@C we probably don't have game anywhere|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well done|pg||
nt|paulg: i don't see drury on their card so I'm a little surprised she did not respond 2@d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now 4@D to agree diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: thx Diarmuid|pg||
nt|aupillon: I prefer 1@d : the worst minor suit ( Hog partenering Hog) :)|pg||
nt|greerm: I think these strong hands with singleton are not always best starting with splinter, have to carry on anyway after the denial|pg||
nt|greerm: 6@H now|pg||
mb|6H|nt|paulg: i do too, as long as it does not guarantee 4 clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnc: North must be surprised seeing partner Blackwooding|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can't see that helping here - not good news for East|pg||
nt|capercliff: @h lead coming|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this could depend upon the lead...|pg||
nt|aupillon: @h for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: and cant go wrong|pg||
nt|aupillon: and so what ? as one says. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: although even on a heart lead, West will probably switch to diamonds  |pg||
nt|capercliff: too late I think Mike?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no......|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: don't agree with 3NT|pg||
nt|toobad: true, but the reverse works in that a 3d rebid after 2nt is hardly gonna excite south|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chick: A bit risky BW, as S can't know about the @SK|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well that saves a trick|pg||
nt|paulg: suppressing 5-card support is rarely a good idea, but I think it is a difficult slam to bid confidently|pg||
nt|lestergold: its dreadful- spade lead and play werong diamond honour and 3n offski!|pg||
nt|paulg: certainly 4@d looked a better option|pg||
pc|c5|nt|odysseus69: playing South for 4 card heart suit - cant say I fancy that|pg||
nt|toobad: that shd speed matters up|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bobholl: kib and i wondering why E asked :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: at least play the hand in a sensible game like 5d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, but at the score you should at least make an effort, even if you stop in 5@D |pg||
nt|odysseus69: effvely this was 1H -4NT - unlikely to do damage except when North has club void|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|capercliff: now its easy|pg||
nt|chessmaste: On a diamond lead declarer simply knocks out the ace of spades|pg||
nt|aupillon: i think the reason not playing @d is that 1NT often hides a diamond suit|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|aupillon: @s|pg||
nt|paulg: actually, I don't like East's first bid ... I would respond 2@d rather than 1@s|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|aupillon: merci|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|chessmaste: On a heart lead the diamond switch leaves declarer with four @C, three @H and 1@D - one short|pg||
nt|capercliff: actually you are right Mark, and declarer should maybe rise with the A for that reason|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: i think Mike we agree even if we dont agree on counting or spelling|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, you have an easy 2@S over a 2@H rebid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we do agree on counting and spelling - we are just not very good at them|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chick: we're actually playing this out?|pg||
nt|bobholl: claim :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes and Paul the hand was a game forcing hand so should have bid the 5 card diamond suit first i agree|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|capercliff: if up with A@h is 9|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcomyn: tight game|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What was the result on board 2? No score entered|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The lead was @H 3 so declarer knew hearts were probably 4-2 - maybe she hoped East had led low from @H KQx3|pg||
nt|capercliff: but she had the K in her hand|pg||
nt|paulg: a complete misfit, so they need to stop bidding as soon as possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: They probably could have.  I think it's a big overstatement to think that the Ozenir team are at a disadvantage |pg||
nt|toobad: v probable|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|paulg: 3@c probably a mixed raise (what ever that means)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 1NT by East -1 as I recollect|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 4-card support, limited values|pg||
nt|odysseus69: do we agree with East pass?|pg||
nt|toobad: how many spades from E??|pg||

nt|odysseus69: may not be so easy to reach 4H but good to be playing that 2C = h+|pg||
nt|greerm: it will be hard to get a reaction from East flat 4333 hand|pg||
nt|greerm: does 2@C show @H?|pg||

nt|greerm: 2@D presume says mine equal|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: it's probably good for a new partnership to have easy straightforward bidding, but a little boring for us :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: a wise decsion|pg||
nt|paulg: the clues were there and they did well|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not a completely classic take-out double, and hits the worst possible response|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2D says pick-I assume |pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcomyn: daresay the H bid put her off|pg||
nt|chick: 4 small in the opps suit is not a good holding :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: at least we know better than normal what's going on :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is a stop-gap pairing folks|pg||
nt|paulg: I'm sure Martin knows, but probably doesn't care what it actually shows|pg||
nt|paulg: 2nd in hand I agree with East's pass|pg||
nt|toobad: woops|pg||
nt|capercliff: even if playing the A at trick 1 was almost 100%|pg||
nt|lestergold: well poor old wales they relly are dropping into the mire when they dont need to|pg||
nt|greerm: but west doesn't know about the vital 3rd H|pg||
nt|toobad: W might try 3h then E will bid 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: After the light opener she may well drop @SK|pg||
nt|paulg: yes, especially if the @dQ is led|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnc: Could be hard to manage, with dummy likely overruffed|pg||
nt|jcomyn: looks a good decision to stay out of game|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4NT???|pg||
nt|paulg: this should be invitational|pg||
nt|capercliff: well 3@c shows a good 2@h hand?|pg||
nt|toobad: no|pg||
nt|greerm: not the time for south to practice the law|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnc: At least there will be less problems in this contract than in the higher one|pg||
nt|aupillon: i don't know what you thing but i love PASS|pg||
nt|paulg: if partner does not have an invite, then why not 2@h initially|pg||
nt|aupillon: it depends of the OTHER possibilities they play on 2@d i suppose|pg||
nt|paulg: very strong 1-suiter minor and 23-24 balanced|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but I am afraid that this is a violation of Burn's First law|pg||

nt|diumraid: Current in Running Scores are as follows  N-IRELAND  19,  ENGLAND  16,   IRELAND  16,  SCOTLAND 14, CBAI 14, WALES  11|pg||
nt|greerm: judging from hand 1, NS are playing weak NT in the other room which may make it easier for EW to get to 4@H|pg||
nt|greerm: in the closed room england N opened the 13 point hand 1 with 1NT|pg||
nt|greerm: sorry in the Open room|pg||
nt|odysseus69: likely that east has 3 card support after Norths double 2D unless 2-2 in majors so probably good idea for West to bid 3H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: my computer is playing up- am leaving to come back|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|odysseus69: some days and definitely when behind|pg||

nt|dan_hohor: from my experience , when you reach the last set of the 64 boards ( in the 2nd day ) you just play instinctively as it becomes too hard to count and put some logic together|pg||
nt|bobholl: they got a @H trick so nothing missed :)|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Not very often but it is very descriptive.  You can bid 2S on hands like this and have more room to explore.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, Alex, NI did open the east hand on board 2 - you need to know the field :)|pg||

nt|mdgraham: I like that terminology - a "competier" - a hand on which you would like to make one bid|pg||
nt|greerm: reversing|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: in the ending dummy's 3rd trump was in control, very neat|pg||
mb|1H|nt|dan_hohor: 2D will do|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The women should be able to avoid the 4-level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, still close|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW could reach 3NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Did they take all double cards away from West in the other room?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: very funny|pg||
nt|capercliff: would be interesting to get an interpretation of the auction, but they were on the same page|pg||
nt|aupillon: another tricky hand|pg||
nt|greerm: 4@H available by S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bobholl: points + @S LT 15 :)|pg||
nt|paulg: yes, looks like a normal place to end|pg||
nt|lestergold: another not too great hand for e/w 3n likely to be bid 15 opp 10 but hands fit badly and cards lie unkindly except in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: NS are playing 2/1 |pg||
mb|4H|nt|lethal666: i was thinking that exact point|pg||
nt|paulg: double by West?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: probably|pg||
nt|lestergold: trick maybe givn on lead |pg||
nt|mdgraham: operator, could you tell us if they are using screens, please?|pg||
nt|paulg: they do use screens|pg||
nt|greerm: now 3@H ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lethal666: 3nt just doesnt seem to have the tricks. one down is probable|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: lets see...|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: I can see only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That might be an effective lead ... a club lead would be a real problem|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: stranger things have happened|pg||
nt|Walddk5: @HQ is an excellent choice of leads|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One thing is for sure.  Brad Wein will need to be wide awake here to make the contract|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Serious restraint by South - I think I would want to bid that suit in case West bid 3NT|pg||
nt|paulg: not a classic 1NT and a bit good to my liking, but they'll get to 3NT anyhow|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i expect to read about board 17 in many reports|pg||
nt|capercliff: think I would rather 1N with the W hand|pg||
nt|paulg: it depends what system they are playing|pg||
nt|capercliff: but its borderline|pg||
nt|aupillon: with AAK ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ty|pg||
nt|toobad: dangerous now|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: i'd want to bid that suit whatever West might bid|pg||
nt|cuttysark: She has missed a thin game|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Yes, I'd be in with 3@d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C=checkback one assumes|pg||
nt|lestergold: but look at the communications- there are theoreiclly 4 spade tricks avilable but you have to get to dummy finesse establish and reurn and cash the 4th spade!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: you may need a helicopter or a harrier jump jet for that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, that double may lead to the @CQ lead, and then East has two club tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: There are a zillion endplays possible|pg||
nt|toobad: ditto|pg||
nt|toobad: good pass|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugrapha3: he looks confident... :)|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: spade switch best|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I wouldn't even know how to play the hand with all cards in view|pg||
nt|Walddk5: It's very complicated|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: it is , but it is also very complicated for the defence|pg||
nt|paulg: 1NT shows 12-16|pg||
pc|c2|nt|odysseus69: the oprning 1NT is going to be rearded with d lead|pg||
nt|paulg: from what i'm told, these reports should focus on the excellent play here rather than the ping-pong affair in the other rooom|pg||
nt|odysseus69: rewarded|pg||
pc|c7|nt|aupillon: a trick short i suppose|pg||
nt|paulg: if they are playing Acol and weak notrump then 1NT is not an option|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East might raise this to 3NT|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|rnc: Looks like nine tricks, with all main suits breaking to declarer's advantage|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no double by North- cannot tell how many red suit tricks will run |pg||
nt|greerm: a very nice dummy after the auction|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dan_hohor: S is in danger to be thrown in to give the 9th trick in @d|pg||
pc|c5|nt|paulg: looks like any lead will be helpful|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: oh my giddy aunt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but double strikes gold in another way |pg||
nt|mdgraham: South is feeling MUCH happier now|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it only hundreds|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|toobad: 800s do that sometimes to some|pg||
nt|lestergold: instead of 800s or 1100s|pg||
pc|s8|nt|dan_hohor: that if waine plays dimond to the 10|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Only 3 figures - not a big deal!|pg||
nt|paulg: slight signalling problem there but only the second undertrick gone|pg||
nt|greerm: N did well to pass|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|diumraid: Comparison Scores are being loaded - Current state after 5 boards compared is 19 imps each !!!   so its currently a draw|pg||
nt|rnc: However, on double dummy basis NS could have managed an uppercut for a 5th trick|pg||
nt|rnc: But not likely to be found i practise|pg||
nt|rnc: in|pg||
nt|odysseus69: except possibly c9|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|capercliff: the J@s is suit prefernce for @d me thinks|pg||
nt|lestergold: this 4h bid is totally incomprehensible|pg||
nt|paulg: i think it really shows a lack of detailed methods, especially after the double|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: but W should have 5 spades or 3 hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: with north doubling the club bid i do not understand why south imagines that e/w have ot somewhere to run|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dan_hohor: now it is pressure, do you play D to the 10 ? I wonder why did Alexander throw her settind trick in spades  :) ?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looked right to start on spades|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dan_hohor: he has some nerve :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he will make it|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rednaxela: Less likely to be taken for a big number at these colours.  No-one will have a trump stack and they ar more likely to take their vulnerable game bonus.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: presumably East was afraid her partner had something like 10xx of clubs and that NS would run the suit   |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cuttysark: South cannot have @SA as well as the diamonds|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chessmaste: North is hoping her partner can look after the diamonds|pg||

nt|jcomyn: Right lets get this straight for information purposes. The Ireland team consisted of just 5 players a month ago for some strange reason. The one dropped out and then two more, ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: leaving just 2 of the original five. Why it is still 5 beats all understanding, not to mention a completely untried pairing|pg||

mb|1N!|nt|Walddk5: Not sure what 2@C is. If a 2-suiter, I don't agree. It's a one-suited hand|pg||

nt|aupillon: 1NT and pass|pg||
nt|paulg: committed to passing this I think|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: misfits galore |pg||
nt|paulg: 2@h now, nervously|pg||
nt|lestergold: only fit here is n/s clubs and that wont be bid|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|paulg: 1NT would be a strong rebid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anyone for 2@H as East?|pg||
mb|p|nt|aupillon: i see. They play weak NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w probhably manage 2d as cards lie|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2h by east seems reasonably normal certainly not absurd|pg||
nt|lestergold: passing one spade i dont agree|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|rednaxela: I'm with Sheila on this one.  Give me some more 10s and 9s and I'd double.|pg||
nt|paulg: although Adamson is the one smiling when North makes a game forcing response|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Probably would not keep them out of game though|pg||
nt|paulg: and you make 2 spades and 3 clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: and not because or the 5/1 split i know about|pg||
nt|paulg: the pass will probably work out well but it seems a big position to take|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, partenr has high cards - I have a long suit which can take ruffing tricks|pg||
nt|greerm: west may pass this transfer bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dan_hohor: acording to Super 2 : bid 2S |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Roland did not like Super2 dan|pg||
nt|jcomyn: interesting slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|aupillon: ( I told I spy your methods ) :)|pg||
nt|paulg: yes, but if you play a weak 1NT, and do not want to open it here, why not open 1@c and give yourself a chance of playing in all the suits?|pg||
nt|aupillon: good poin|pg||
nt|aupillon: t|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnc: Yes, there are some work to do in 6@H|pg||
nt|greerm: loooks like EW are not clear either, an accident is happening|pg||
nt|toobad: the wheels have come off here|pg||
nt|toobad: BUT......... no double no trouble|pg||
nt|greerm: it seems that west thought 3@S was strong and natural, East meant soemthing else|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: hands not as players hold|pg||
nt|greerm: ah, we are looking at a different hand, so analysts can relax, whew|pg||
nt|toobad: now there's a surprise!! lol|pg||
nt|greerm: was fun trying to work it out|pg||
nt|greerm: was fun seeing a strong pair getting it badly wrong|pg||
nt|greerm: for NI supporters that is|pg||
nt|toobad: I was waiting for Dick Pound to arrive|pg||
nt|odysseus69: is this the right board?|pg||
nt|greerm: the bidding we can see is for board 8, |pg||
nt|greerm: no, too disciplined|pg||
pc|dT|nt|dan_hohor: I know :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I suspect 2D showed 6 hearts - a slight fib|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|greerm: this is difficult to predict, so many options for declarer and defence|pg||
pc|h9|nt|toobad: or a club lead initially for that matter|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcomyn: cards well placed though|pg||
pc|h8|nt|aupillon: i bet on declarer|pg||

nt|Walddk5: But the scheme is intimidating no doubt|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm devastated|pg||
nt|Walddk5: "Look at our defence to 1NT, guys. You dare not open 1NT now, correct?"|pg||
nt|Walddk5: "We can show anything, except majors at the 2-level"|pg||
nt|lestergold: at that stage in the auction you may be missing a game in hearts or no trumps or ev en spades|pg||
nt|greerm: i think will make but could well go off|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cuttysark: As is pointed out, a club lead might beat this - and maybe if I had doubled, and partner had bid clubs, I woud not have been tested|pg||
nt|rednaxela: As with the light opening that led to the K@S being dropped earlier, light doubles can give away the location of honours when you end up defending.  Swings and roundabouts.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: ill go for 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|rnc: Indeed|pg||
nt|bobholl: !next (free after joey (silver))|pg||
nt|jcomyn: would think N bid 2C not 2H|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|paulg: i rather make a light double of 1@h and get spades into the game|pg||
nt|toobad: hedging your bets Greer|pg||
nt|greerm: I think @S to J now|pg||
nt|toobad: 7d from south cuts communications anyway|pg||
nt|odysseus69: m c to 10|pg||
nt|greerm: I believe the slam has been scored for borad 7, when vulnerable instead of 8, non vulnerable, so slightly less imps |pg||
nt|toobad: good news|pg||

mb|5D|nt|toobad: kept them ou of 4h|pg||

pc|cK|nt|chick: operator, I think you missed a pass in there :)|pg||
nt|chick: cuebid opps suit is normally a limit raise or better ... if I had never played with someone, that's what I'd assume|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: small break here|pg||
nt|chick: still has to find the @HQ or set up @Ds for a spade pitch|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wont|pg||
nt|bobholl: my guess is that she will :)|pg||
nt|aupillon: clubs bid were depressing for a slam trial|pg||
nt|odysseus69: difficult to see 3NT making but we will never know now|pg||
nt|greerm: a simple 11 tricks, well done Mary Madden|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5D was a good and winning bid - well done|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcomyn: disciplined pass by W|pg||
nt|paulg: a simple hand to play ... cash the long suit and hope that something (very) good happens|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Declarer will cash he long suit, but South can find four discards|pg||
nt|aupillon: small small|pg||
nt|paulg: the double looks like an instinctive reaction rather than a considered call|pg||
nt|greerm: 3NT makes when West doesn't start with @C|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not that she could bid anything|pg||

nt|vugraphzmn: reminds her to lead one...|pg||
nt|toobad: the bad news for NI is that Ciara and Diane were in 6c 1 off on board 8....... so a big swing to England|pg||
pc|cA|nt|paulg: Martin will be wondering if they can cash two clubs, or pump dummy and freeze the diamond suit|pg||
nt|paulg: both lines work on this hand|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|d2|pg||

pc|dA|nt|dan_hohor: but that was on the strong side Roland , AKJ , AKJ . A q in the majors will do for game|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Well, in that case bid the game yourself|pg||
nt|Walddk5: But who says partner isn't 2-1 in the majors?|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: so Alexander chickened out with 3S , as you can not control a Q here and there|pg||

pc|d6|nt|jcomyn: c back - but...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but heart looks right -with 8 hearts West might have bid|pg||

nt|toobad: good defence|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|c8|pc|dT|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk5: 2@S did not promise support, North simply gavee preference|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|c9|nt|aupillon: fortunately. There is a small shop, called NONSTOP behind my home. But it closes at 6 :)|pg||

nt|odysseus69: I do - partner had a wasted spade ace only 4 diamonds yet slam was laydown - was worth 4D for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: 4s in the bag|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@H negative free bid or F suppose F|pg||
nt|toobad: she bid 3 slams on the bouce yesterday boards 1, 2 and 3 and made 6nt on an endplay on board 1|pg||
nt|toobad: therefore a swing to NI and the match is even AGAIN!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: even more so playing 4-card majors|pg||

nt|james_h: I prefer to get the hand off the chest in one bid, I'm not a fan of 2s with such a potentially powerful hand and a known 9 card fit|pg||

nt|cuttysark: I guess Anne expected slightly more for 3NT|pg||

mb|5D|nt|Walddk5: Quick claim. Draw trumps and show your cards, condecing two heart tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobholl: bad guess :)|pg||

nt|chick: at least this one won't need defense help to make :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely that has to be doubled|pg||
nt|james_h: 4s is cold here|pg||
nt|greerm: a safe looking dbl by west will get a few imps, depending on the defence|pg||
pc|s5|nt|capercliff: 2@s is a rather mild view|pg||
nt|paulg: i think Cliff (and I) would have a mild rebid question on the East hand opposite our "up to 11" 1NT, easier for Lee here|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|cuttysark: I expect declarer is happy|pg||
nt|odysseus69: does that mean that she is not allowed to bid todays slams|pg||

nt|chessmaste: Declarer will be nervouson that lead - she has no idea things are so friendly|pg||

mb|1D|nt|chick: 3 hands to play, 5 to compare, and tied score|pg||
nt|paulg: yes, i normally try at trick 1 to achieve that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: There is a little device there - if West had doubled 2@S for take-out, East can transfer to hearts with 3@D and then bid a natural 4@D. Not saying you would get to slam, but at ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: least you would be in game |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: and if you don't have that available you could just bid 4@h|pg||
mb|1H|nt|odysseus69: no answer to that one Roland|pg||
nt|aupillon: 4 hearts ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Maybe our operator has|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jcomyn: and a nasty -300 on 28|pg||
nt|paulg: not an obvious double there ... Macdonald may well pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: wrong score entered probably|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bjacobs: Zia would be good too - I'm sure he'd be interested|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|cuttysark: first step of a raise to 2NT, or the road to ruin...|pg||

nt|capercliff: the wrong hand is getting forced|pg||

nt|capercliff: but even then tapping doesnt hurt as trumps are 3-2|pg||

nt|dan_hohor: comms problems even with sp finesse ok|pg||
nt|bjacobs: How about a diamond finesse?|pg||
nt|paulg: Fred said it was the right thing to do|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This would be a lot better if West had a third spade|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: welcome to final set|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: welcome to Leigh Gold, Dan Hohor|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: 2@h wasalerted but no expl|pg||
nt|james_h: agree Bob, but can it hurt with 3 card support in spades ...|pg||
nt|bobholl: in newell's too :)|pg||
nt|paulg: 3@h should really show a normal limit raise here (as she has)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H seems a tad windy|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, but she will have to take a position in clubs|pg||
nt|greerm: 2 obvious losers outside the @C suit|pg||
nt|greerm: a little help from the defence might be nice :)|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, East might save, and then North will have the slightly easier task of remembering to double|pg||
nt|greerm: assuming 4@S plays|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and good chance that she will get clubs right|pg||
nt|greerm: I don't think Anne Fitz is thinking|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: there were a lot of pointers in favour of trump - South had passed with a 6 card heart suit which suggests the possibility of 4 spades - North rated to have either 2-2-4-5 or 1-2 ...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4-6- |pg||
nt|toobad: and they made 12 tricks in hearts too, allegedly!!|pg||
nt|toobad: i hope not|pg||
nt|greerm: so we await the @C suit with bated breath :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|capercliff: not tempted with game here?|pg||
nt|aupillon: Lee =yes; Hand= not. Why not 4 ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why not indeed|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe declarer can avoid the club guess|pg||
nt|odysseus69: duck this|pg||
nt|dburn: win this diamond, lead a heart, win the next diamond, ruff a heart, draw trumps and play a diamond|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcomyn: that 6NT is awful on this hand|pg||
nt|sharkirl: D10 lead, otherwise make|pg||
nt|aupillon: she has more points than everyone|pg||
nt|dburn: but that won't work on the actual lie, I don't think|pg||
nt|greerm: then west will exit a @D David|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sharkirl: wd|pg||
nt|rnc: Missed opportunity in both rooms.|pg||
nt|sharkirl: usual contract, make on any other leag|pg||
nt|toobad: full marks David, but wont happen|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: Traian, bad news for the moment . Aus batting and they are 14 for 3 after 5 overs !|pg||
pc|s3|nt|james_h: in fact I like that bid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good case here for not leading partners suit|pg||
nt|paulg: strange auction in the other room, i wonder if they had a forcing pass, or not, misunderstanding|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lethal666: good X by south, otherwise north would definatly bid 5C or 5d|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: Aus plays South Africa in a one day game ( cricket )|pg||
nt|toobad: south holding the Ac should have guessed that any north cards are working for her|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|petergill: Another diamond is best I think, but that defence is not obvious. |pg||
nt|lethal666: from norths vu point, nothing seems great, so might as well come another D|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Peter Gill is with us as well....a great aussie player|pg||
nt|odysseus69: you are right Paul- the only explanation|pg||
nt|aupillon: Tell me before finishing, which is better whiskey ? Scottish or Welsh ? Have to go to my boutique.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|chick: I think it's a very normal bid, clubs were never in the running|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|bobholl: would you put the J of @H now i wouldn't|pg||
nt|greerm: i thin C guessing by declarer more likely|pg||
nt|toobad: me too|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dan_hohor: one of the best bridge technicians , Sydney based |pg||
nt|james_h: oIt does not work so well when playing 4cM but North shd prob bid 4|pg||
nt|paulg: as John has pointed out, North's @dQ makes a huge difference to the hand|pg||
pc|c8|nt|paulg: should be fairly easy for Martin to duck this ... the diamond and spade suits suggest that more than one heart is needed|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the guess at trick 1 was crucial-although this delay is making me nervous|pg||
nt|toobad: 2h is missing so she should duck|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: The best whisky is Bhunnahabhain (inho)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: Wbelieving j@c|pg||
nt|odysseus69: difficult now that entry gone|pg||
nt|dburn: well, she no longer has the entries|pg||
nt|greerm: and now the vital entry has gone, 4@S wasn't best|pg||
nt|dburn: so even if she had put in the nine, she was still down|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg: any other queen, even though helpful, would make game a poor proposition|pg||
pc|h2|nt|paulg: well done|pg||
nt|odysseus69: it looks right to play heart Q at rick 1 - prepared to lose 2 hearts if West produces the king|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||
nt|petergill: now it's just -1, 100 to NS. |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Serhat in the tank|pg||
nt|petergill: NS are not far off making 4@D, but NS did well not to reach the five level. |pg||
nt|lethal666: i predict 5 imps to Caplan|pg||
nt|odysseus69: or alternatively to duck the Jack|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|paulg: so NI a little unlucky here|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jcomyn: but whyCornelia if it were H or S there would be no problem|pg||
pc|h7|pc|sT|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: it is interesting , as one of the spectators points out, that the teams have kept the same placing during the 64 boards|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT by NS is not hopeless, if the defence plays on @H for instance. |pg||
nt|bobholl: she won't expect to win on this board but she does :)|pg||
nt|greerm: easy defence now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not keeping the spade 4 was poor technique|pg||
pc|cK|nt|toobad: afraid so|pg||
pc|c7|nt|toobad: the 5d on board 26 from NI has gained 13 imps, 3nt going off 2 in the open room|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: EW are not a regular partnership. 3@S is intended by East as a cue bid, but might confuse West, who might expect it to be a splinter. |pg||

nt|aupillon: this can't win|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: i really don't know why Maida Grant makes invitational bids, she knows her partner just bids game over them|pg||
nt|capercliff: game try, bid game then try to make it|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dan_hohor: an opportunity for another 11 imps for the Caplan team|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: for sure|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Australia collapsing at 19 for 5 after 7.2 overs|pg||
nt|cuttysark: She might - but it's a risky bid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: stayman would have produced a diamond lead and made it easy - not that I am suggesting Stayman|pg||
nt|toobad: at least it pushed them up to 3h|pg||
nt|greerm: 4@H seems very high in the open room|pg||
nt|odysseus69: somehow they ascended to 4H in Open Room|pg||
nt|greerm: i am told the other room bid 1@D 1@H 4@H seems odd|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: delayed reaction here - captains both called as bidding had been overheard at another table in closed room|pg||
nt|greerm: revise that, was 1@D 1@H 3@H 4@H more plausible|pg||
nt|heatherd: Hi All, I don't like the 2@c bid, more of a case over 1@d than 1@d P 1@h|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont think they heard the opening lead|pg||
nt|greerm: even 3@H was a stretch but sometimes when much too high, the defence lets in a few undertricks|pg||
nt|heatherd: Can make it harder for them to locate a major suit fit|pg||
nt|toobad: the police are having their work cut out this morning|pg||
nt|greerm: if a bid was heard across the room, this board may well be the second to be scrapped or substituted|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i suspect that c3 is a typo|pg||
nt|toobad: agreed|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: board to be played |pg||
nt|greerm: well, the 2@C bid isn't approved of either|pg||
nt|heatherd: Hi Roland, I don't actually think I am early, they're late!|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: lead not typo!|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|james_h: I'm celebrating my 21st this weekend ... you can all kibitz in my house|pg||

nt|chick: or Ragnarsson :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and still cant no d in the middle sorry Carl|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that spade jack was a bit quick for my liking|pg||
nt|paulg: finessing is over-rated .. just plonk down the A and K and let the queens fall. They do it at the club all the time, why is it so difficult for internationalists?|pg||

nt|greerm: looks like 5 straightforward losers now for 1 off and 3 imps to England|pg||
nt|heatherd: Can't avoid 1 off, so should be 3IMPs to England|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|toobad: 5 here for NI|pg||
nt|capercliff: if @d were friendly this might have play, perhaps there is a case for bidding @d after 3@c|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|petergill: This sort of bidding sequence happens so often in Australia ...  if you are going to plly Splinters, define them in adavnce e.g. "any jump below game where the non-jump is forcing ...|pg||
nt|petergill: is a splinter, and that includes 4H and 4S, which are not natural" Or some definition like that|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: hey Roland how do you know ?|pg||
nt|aupillon: small club, only chance|pg||
