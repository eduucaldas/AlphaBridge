nt|chick: Hello Everyone!  @H@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: this first hand is a bit of a misfit so the issue might be who gets stuck holding the hot potatoe|pg||

mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stayman was not out of the question|pg||
nt|athene: not only is it safe, but east gets to make two discards which might be helpful|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you were right in a way about the auction Bill. it was passed out. after the opening bid, that is :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes, stayman was a possibility with the north hand (intending to pass any rebid from opener)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: south is bidding a lot|pg||
nt|eggy: Just when West thought it was starting to look good|pg||
nt|henryb: then 2@h = pass or correct|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Your commentators are Marshall Lewis and William Frisby|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@S looks makeable|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Player names please operator|pg||
nt|athene: south has a very nice hand, even if she doesn't have a name yet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: usually they make it through a few hands before they play anonymously|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a LOT off|pg||
nt|eggy: quite a poor bid by east on reflection|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i can think of people who would open 2@C on that south hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi Catherine, Steve, Calle and Geoffrey. Havee fun :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|rnc: Hi|pg||
nt|eggy: west almost guaranteed to hold 5 spade|pg||
nt|henryb: indeed: favorable breaks in all suits and @hA well placed|pg||
nt|mamos: whereas 1Nt would make so Catherine North has done well|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: hi roland will do|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|roswolf: a feisty auction and i am not sure whether this will be an objectively good result for the declaring side|pg||
nt|col3435: yes, how does 4@h do?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: 2S plays well. but 1NT can make also|pg||
nt|col3435: seems to me like it might come in|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: yes, there is the double heart finesse for declarer if she chooses to take it|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|roswolf: yes it may well but will e/w get there in the other room? n/s bidding i think helped|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|rnc: South was quite happy I suppose when seeing dummy with 5 spades|pg||
pc|h2|nt|col3435: I'd say West always had enough to bid 4@h after East had raised|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Let's suppose North cashed a top club and then switched to the jack of diamonds - quite testing for declarer then |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: it is all about the first round of hearts and cashing only one diamond before playing hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but she will surely throw a heart here|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
nt|rnc: yes|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: -800 seems predestined|pg||
nt|eggy: lucky it wasn't 1100 on that line|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|nt|athene: now south gets squeezed in spades and diamonds|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c5|nt|henryb: I think she should have ducked the first club|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: well, she would have done if declarer finessed hearts retaining a top diamond in hand|pg||
pc|s4|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: sorry *East* gets squeezed|pg||
pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: since S needs heart king on regardless, the choice is between 3-3 diamonds and heart ten being onside. the latter is more likely|pg||

mb|p|nt|mmmakela: this looks interesting|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@h?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mmmakela: bet in 5-level pretty quickly|pg||
nt|werge: 6 @S is lay-down double-dummy|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mariner1: 5@S makes, 6@H is a save IF they can drop the K@C, a Rabbi would.........|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|mariner1: Rabbi's Rule = when the king is singleton play the Ace|pg||
nt|mmmakela: even being vul 3 @H very tame|pg||
nt|werge: West has a good hand - after N/S´s @D-bidding|pg||
nt|chick: at this vul, NS can't even take the @D sacrifice|pg||

mb|p|nt|phil: wow!|pg||
nt|werge: 6 @S is better|pg||
nt|chick: choice of slam bid|pg||
nt|werge: A bad decision to bid slam - N/S have indicated bad breaks|pg||
nt|phil: note that South is going to be endplayed after winning the @cK, which will negate one of the guesses - assuming declarer takes the time to eliminate diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: good rule in the long run..|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: very hard to disagnose though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E took a real chance here...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north was doing the thinking :) i doubt east had to think too hard about that one|pg||

nt|henryb: He called in his economists. they said 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: without birth control 2+2 can equal quite a lot|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: i might have bid something over 1@C as east|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sn00py27: I thought we might get an idea on this hand whether they play weak or strong NT :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In these times many East's would open - especially with an eye on the vulnerability|pg||
nt|sn00py27: E/W|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this should be easy enough|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: probably better to play in 7D. at least you go off only one when diamonds break your heart|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D must be showing something like north's hand - and south ought to be getting mildly excited|pg||
nt|col3435: some convention cards at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/lmteams.htm|pg||
nt|col3435: N/S play "Acol with 5-card majors and a strong NT"|pg||
nt|col3435: E/W card isn't there but I think they play strong+5 too|pg||
nt|sn00py27: Not quite Acol then !|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: the aces will take care of partner's @H+@C losers, however those two cards are split|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|col3435: well, yes. Seems like a contradiction in terms to me. But that's what they say.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: @SJ10 might be useful fillers...@DAK9 is great|pg||
nt|henryb: he did not like that, so he called in his information tech people. wait a moment they said, we will check on the computer|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: understandable that NS are hoping to create some action given the match score. but that 5C bid is infinitely more likely to widen the gap than to close it|pg||
nt|athene: East will be disappointed to get only her top trumps from here|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|nt|athene: admittedly you don't want to bid a grand slam when there is a chance they might not reach the small slam in the other room|pg||
pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: i am puzzled why N did not respond 2D|pg||
nt|athene: a 6-card minor is shorter than a 5-card major, for most people, these days|pg||
nt|col3435: (it probably just means "not 2/1 GF")|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: i am sorry to say|pg||

nt|bobh1: he probably figured--"why didn't he strip the hand?" . . . |pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: 6 @C seems to be lay-down. South is end-played after ruffing @D - and he must "give" away the @H-suit. Now it looks like a show-up squeeze against North - and that will tell, who ...|pg||
nt|werge: is in position of the cricial @S Queen|pg||

nt|werge: crucial|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2C|mb|2D|nt|phil: looks like 4@s which will depend on guessing the club Q (or maybe a misdefense)|pg||

nt|werge: As always: 3 NT is the contract...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: yes, 3N is excellent|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|mcarroll: And now it all depends on finding @CQ|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|d3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True - give up the lead in @D and the opps have to help declarer|pg||

nt|mamos: 1NT for me|pg||
nt|sn00py27: opp passed hand I am happy to settle with 1NT|pg||
nt|henryb: I think I would double and bid 2N actually|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|athene: east doubled 1@D intending to bid spades next and show a strong hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has announced a strong NT, and six is cold facing both round aces and diamond KQ, which is only 13|pg||
nt|chessmaste: South might protect |pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be finis|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1nt not unreasonable all acions are going to be distorted with this hand|pg||
nt|sn00py27: but I would do something with S - unless they play 2@C as conventional and she has no easy bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1n is the closest|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|athene: she doesn't really want her next decision to be selecting a lead to 1@DX|pg||
nt|athene: it's a pretty good suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: she appears to|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: south should bid 2c surely|pg||
mb|3D|nt|marlowepi: i wouldn;t need to be tempted. i would do it before temptation even arose|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i would not like to play the n/s hands at the 3 level but maybe that is why i am commentating these days|pg||
nt|henryb: yes, or double 1N would be my choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hmmm this auction seems illogical|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Enterprising and unlucky to find partner with most of her points in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i assume West in fact didn't pass|pg||
nt|sn00py27: should make 3@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: she has the theoretical values for a double but hand is too top heavy for it for my liking|pg||
nt|mamos: Pass would be a field if partner had psyched|pg||
nt|henryb: partner is third hand at favorable ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: No, it's mainly because you are not a woman|pg||
nt|roswolf: east has saved the opps bacon|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They won't allow you in even if you shave, Geoffrey|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it is probably getting tken out as indeed it was and then u have to show trhis limite dhand at the 3 level|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: either South or West probably bid 1@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you dont want a spade lead from Txxxx or some rubbish against 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: presumably south denied 4 spades by bidding 2nt|pg||
nt|sn00py27: as 8 counts go - it is quite decent|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes has the 2 extra 9's|pg||
nt|lestergold: even more reason to bid a quiet 2 clubs|pg||
nt|mamos: i like 2C because if partner is light you have tolerance for @S and no great harm is done|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate this hand was always likely to finish where it has|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: maybe N simply did the multiplication and made the bid that would complete the equation|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3@H I don't care for|pg||
nt|chessmaste: or 3@S|pg||
nt|sn00py27: me neither, was thinking of passing back to partner or 2NT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: well, good old partner found a club lead anyway :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 3@S was very hasty|pg||
nt|col3435: yes it ought to be possible for N/S to scramble to their best fit after the Dbl|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3@S has two chances - slim and none|pg||
nt|col3435: but evidently a confident 3@h has its merits|pg||
nt|lestergold: and its infrangible|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|henryb: I prefer impregnable|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: and 1NT or 2NT is a likely enough rebid for S|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|lestergold: a new one but be careful Henry some of these ladies are quite young |pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: it is not devoid of hope - defence may assist|pg||
nt|rnc: Due to the CC, a direct 2NT would have been xfer to @D - so this will presumably be their way to invite "1NT-2NT"|pg||
pc|c5|pg||

nt|eggy: at least on the 800 hand - Stockdale bid the making game (5D)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: an awful lot of slams in this set already. what's up with that? a spec asked if this is goulasch LOL|pg||
nt|athene: Multi-2@D; east might try 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb: a bad unbiddable 3N?|pg||
nt|henryb: that happens to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: now this could be fun|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 16 +8 will they bid 3NT?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: an awful lot of slam bidding, and vice versa :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: looks like the Multi. either that or everybody has a fatal attraction for the 2D card in the bidding box (as did S on the previous hand)|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D is certainly spades but hard to be sure what strength it shows|pg||
nt|athene: there are several schemes for rebids here, and west might be cautiously treating it as minimum or optimistically treating it as maximium|pg||
nt|rnc: And if bid and made twice, it'll be... 800 :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|marlowepi: 5C may not be a great idea when one opp has passed and your partner has not|pg||

nt|roswolf: ty|pg||
nt|eggy: If she'd tried 6, she'd have made that too I suppose|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: i think north could afford to take it a bit slower|pg||
nt|athene: one opponent has passed|pg||
nt|athene: and you have a fair amount in the majors|pg||
nt|eggy: unless West leads a spade|pg||
nt|sn00py27: 1nt - 3NT ?|pg||
nt|henryb: at most 2N|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: tracy is in aggressive mood today|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: @CAK @DAK for the defence here, and they don't have to find them right away|pg||
nt|athene: although they do have to be a little bit careful|pg||
nt|lestergold: combined 24 good intermediates 3n a fair shot and it makes comfortably on any lead|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: and it's game-all - opps aren't at favourable or anything scary like that|pg||
mb|p|nt|sn00py27: East's bidding on this hand has worked well|pg||
nt|chessmaste: They have done well - hardly obvious to insist on game facing a weak two in diamonds|pg||
nt|sn00py27: good start|pg||
nt|lestergold: north should go|pg||

pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: could @DA and another ever be wrong?|pg||

pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade intermediates good- dims can b e blocked or notm led when they are 5/3|pg||

mb|3N|nt|athene: a very comfortable contract here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: who put dummy down?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Suit quality is a factor for some players|pg||
nt|roswolf: provoking opps to bid a game which they might not have reached unaided is the downside of such pre-empts|pg||
nt|sn00py27: not to mention the 500 that was on offer from 4@H :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: True, but assuming South would have opened 1@D game was sure to be reached|pg||
nt|roswolf: a more telling point catherine!|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Hard to double 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: in my view east should bid 3h over 2s- amaybe a slight overbid but she is under pressure and partner needs to know how good those hearst are|pg||
nt|lestergold: partner knows that she is under pressure|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n is appaling|pg||
nt|henryb: I do not agree. she is at least an ace light for 3@h|pg||
mb|d|mb|4H|nt|lestergold: with thin stops double was unwise|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: to be fair strong suits in weak hands can be dificult  I think East has shown her hand well|pg||
nt|lestergold: pushing them to 4h which as we can see cn make on a spade lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: We will soon be on to the next deal now|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: and if north bids spades enthusiastically, that can only help west|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: west of course doesn't expect that her partner has so little wasted in spades|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt would have worked out fine as well, even though they are off the club suit|pg||
mb|1N|nt|diumraid: Current in Running Scores are as follows  N-IRELAND  19,  ENGLAND  16,   IRELAND  16,  SCOTLAND 14, CBAI 14, WALES  11|pg||
nt|col3435: a spade lead might also give the game away|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt:  3@S was possible with 2 aces,  but a bit thin for a slam try|pg||
nt|chessmaste: West will have an awkward lead against 4@H|pg||
nt|sn00py27: very dangerous with 4333|pg||
nt|mamos: are NS too high already?|pg||
nt|lestergold: that case may end up with fornsic investigators in the cold case files|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|athene: they will play 4@S now and just lose @H @C @C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this deal looks like a 2-bid auction to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|sn00py27: I wd probably fish out the 4 @S - not a success here |pg||
nt|lestergold: well maybe they are but they havent done anything wrong yet|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|col3435: I'd have the @s4 on the table in a flash, and declarer would be very grateful|pg||
nt|sn00py27: not sure our support for the lead will make West feel any better !|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In one sense North did well not to respond 1@S  |pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: this looks safe enough - time for a quick cuppa|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt:  predict 13?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: with the NOrth cards opposite a 15-17 NT, 3NTdirectly is tempting|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: what does 2c mean?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 2d?|pg||
nt|sn00py27: puppet to 2@D which you can pass if weak with @D|pg||
nt|henryb: transfer to 2@d; start of possibly invitational sequences|pg||
nt|mamos: i think this is a good piece of convention but not sure Souths hand is suitable|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah hah|pg||
nt|sn00py27: or make invitational bids - 2@D over 1NT would be GF|pg||
nt|mamos: gladiator|pg||
nt|lestergold: but what is wrong with 1n soutgh is not weak|pg||
pc|cK|nt|henryb: by a passed hand perhaps not the best use of the bids|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|lestergold: 1n struggles mainly because of bad break in dimaonds! |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: certainly 13 now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|eggy: not Mike Lawrences view though|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: by which same token 8 tricks in diamonds becomes a tall order|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|chessmaste: In some book I suggested a lead from a king was very dangerous - and a trump was also bad - plus underleading an ace was out of the question|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sn00py27: maybe in pairs ok, but too dangerous for me at imps|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade switch neede to cut off heart trick|pg||

pc|dK|nt|lestergold: Henry with the greatest respect failure tio open a hand containing 3 aces is a hanging offence in these parts|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: sometimes it is good to use conventions in close decisions, as it keeps you from forgetting them|pg||
nt|eggy: I think there is ahand where you get this auction and x with 4(@S)333 ..|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|athene: of course if you are worried partner is on the point of forgetting them, you have a knife-edge decision|pg||

nt|chessmaste: Good! Going to Sanremo?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: use them to jog his memory, or avoid them in case he forgets? :)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: or removal by men in whjite coats|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|eggy: on the grounds that unless partner is 1444 you must fetch an 8 card fit|pg||

nt|eggy: My copy ofhis book seems to have gone AWOL, so I am afraid I can't reference it|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but was it well defended?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: 3nt just needs 4-3 spades or no spade lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: we have an extra pass in here, operator|pg||
nt|athene: need undo|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the barrage will make things difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: well, this is fair enough|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: many pairs have ways to distinguish a good 2H raise from a nuisance raise over doublke|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H might be a much weaker hand - it would be useful to have 2@D available as a good 3-card raise|pg||
nt|petepunt:  2@d best used as a 8-10 3 card raise|pg||
nt|tejjyid: My least favourite standard auction|pg||
nt|tejjyid: SOuth's pass is very conservative |pg||

nt|sn00py27: if 2@H GF, wonder why not a splinter with W|pg||

pc|d4|nt|petepunt:  when playing 5 card majors and strong nt after x|pg||
nt|athene: the way the bidding went, west might have taken a view and bid game|pg||

mb|1C|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1@D 1@H 1@S 1N by NS uncontested, perhaps|pg||

nt|tejjyid: this is a similar hand - Mighjt go 1@H -2 @D ; 2@H all pass|pg||
nt|athene: well 1@D will certainly get them there!|pg||
nt|mamos: Making 2@D was worth 7 imps to England as 1NT went 2 off|pg||
mb|1H|nt|tejjyid: OK, not any more|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not that it is likely with 3 in each major and a mediocre suit and adverse colors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, that is the easiest way to survive a misguess in trumps....stay low:)|pg||
nt|athene: really 4@H? or are we just skipping to the final contract?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: safety play against wimping out later|pg||
nt|sn00py27: i would prefer 3@D by south or 4.....|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|athene: i expected 1@D to silence West :) but she was not so easily silenced!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrth thinks 4@H is fit showing|pg||
nt|athene: responding 4@H at your first turn with that south hand expresses doubt as to partner's constructive bidding, i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: south's off shape double may complicate matters for everyone|pg||
nt|henryb: in my book 2@c is natural, nf and not particularly encouraging|pg||
nt|sn00py27: assuming it would be natural |pg||

nt|athene: even if 4@H were fit-showing, surely you pass with @HKxx?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: more likely north was scared it was a splinter?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she thought splinter|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 2@C non forcing is popular - but not with Acol players:)|pg||
nt|col3435: yes this 2@c is an Acoly bid|pg||
nt|col3435: E/W aren't playing Acol but I expect that is the influence here|pg||

nt|roswolf: well n/s may beat par|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|henryb: a very useful dummy. it is easy to construct one on which 4@h has no play|pg||
pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: what is E worth if W can't double 1D but did anyway? most systems don;t cover that :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3@H will endplay partner - why not 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: lead holds it to 4 |pg||

mb|2S|nt|lestergold: the bad news of the4/1 trump break balancede by the favourable position of the spade K|pg||

nt|roswolf: n/s should play in 5@D quite easily|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 3@C is aggressive here|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: assuming it's "standard"; i.e. game-forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this N hand looks a lot more like an overcall than did the S hand on   5|pg||
nt|henryb: On the lead of the @d3 a case can be made for playing low from dummy: North has only one higher card and S might have led high from many holdings including AK|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n just as good a spot|pg||
nt|mamos: ah so a variation|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: e.g. north might think that 3@S shows long spades and no diamond stop|pg||

pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: dummy's stiff D will be a very welcome surprise|pg||
nt|athene: this will probably go down|pg||
nt|athene: there are only two obvious losers (@DA, trump)|pg||
nt|athene: but south can overruff spades|pg||
nt|athene: if you draw three rounds of trumps you have a couple of spade losers|pg||
nt|athene: since north has that precious @S8|pg||

nt|athene: she knows her partner has nothing, more or less|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: 4@H might actually have been the only making game?|pg||
nt|athene: a good example of how you want the weaker hand's long suit to be trumps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and why bother? if a major is going to be 3-3, much better for it to be spades|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: any plain suit W might lead would be pretty much a shot in the dark. at least when you lead a trump you know what your goal is, and that your lead is a step toward that goal|pg||

nt|sn00py27: as long as you play drury, partner won't get too carried away|pg||

mb|2S|nt|athene: now she knows it was right to bid on|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: East did well not to get over-excited - she does have quite a lot of HCP for a simple overcall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: really? she opened a rag. maybe all she lost is diff between 50 & 100 while anything by NS going for 300|pg||
nt|lestergold: but if i was openng i would still open a heart|pg||
nt|sn00py27: i like to show where I can take tricks and clubs are not going to be very fruitful :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S makes as the cards lie but that's very lucky|pg||
nt|eggy: true - could be 14 if NS bid 6D|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i love the understatement|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: why not a cuebid from west?|pg||
nt|henryb: surely W should bid 6@d with all those controls, not 5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|eggy: but should lose on the ill-judged 5@H hand|pg||
nt|sn00py27: they are playing 5CM, that's why I said Mike :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: and indeed the opening bid have cost the defence a trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: as predicted|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: well it would be hard for E-W to double 5@C or 5@H i think|pg||
nt|athene: as the cards lie|pg||
nt|col3435: maybe unsure about which suit a cue-bid would be agreeing|pg||
nt|sn00py27: maybe she is thinking minimum, but with so many controls this is better|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 5@D very strange|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: yp east did well to bid 6 in the end|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: if the defence led trumps to stop a diamond ruff, declarer could just ruff the clubs good with the @DA as entry|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C was an alternative for West, over the double|pg||
nt|rnc: Even in game it will be 11 imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: this does not look favorite|pg||
pc|d5|nt|eggy: good lead|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i thought we were talking about S's reaction to the passout, before she knows the layout|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|roswolf: makes the score more respectable|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: on a non-diamond lead, you just play @SAK and another, probably|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe---that line is transparent enough that--IN PRINCIPLE--E can make you guess whether or not the spades are now stiff queen (after spade ace)|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what was 2S?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|diumraid: ******  In Running Scores ******* -  LIVE from LIMERICK ********-   N-Ireland 20, CBAI 17, ENGLAND 16, SCOTLAND 14, IRELAND 13, WALES 10|pg||
nt|eggy: good lead - easy to let this in without it I think|pg||
nt|eggy: oh|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: i assumed it was some number of controls|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS live right. this dreadful contract is cold|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D = 0-1 control, 2@H = 2, 2@S = 3?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Having bid 2@H on the first round North might have recovered with a subtle 3@D on the next|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: (A=2, K=1)|pg||
nt|athene: but south obviously thought it was natural|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks infrangible and more imps to CBAI|pg||
nt|eggy: and with it perhaps|pg||
nt|sn00py27: i was thinking it looked pretty safe on any lead, although I would favour a @H - dummy is probably with 4@S|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: in the other room north never bid over a weak nt - must be losing tactics with a 15 count imo|pg||
nt|sn00py27: partner had passed, so they had an excuse :)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tejjyid: Closed room did well here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: E-W lead 4th best|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: 6@S isn't all that bad|pg||
nt|marlowepi: If I ended up in 6S making on this layout, I would ask the opps if we could just score it as 1370 instead of 1430, so we could tell our teammates we played in 6C. it would be worth ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the lost 2 IMPs|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: 3-3 spades, @SQx, @SQxxx onside|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: hahahaha|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tejjyid: so, from QT96, duck was correct...|pg||
nt|athene: the @H6 couldn't be from @HQ1096 but it might have been @HQ106 or @HQ96 i suppose|pg||
nt|eggy: club now|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: excellent compared to our usual slams Bill, but the right frame of comparison is vis a vis 6C|pg||
nt|sn00py27: she had 9 tricks a second ago - why take the finesse ?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|athene: surely the @H10 would be led from @HQ109(x)?|pg||
nt|henryb: Is 3@d valus in @d or a suggestion of an alternative contract?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Although England have played modestly in this room they are recovering some points at the end of the session|pg||
pc|s9|nt|eggy: isn't she short of anentry (unless she guesses hearts?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|tejjyid: plausibly|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: if W has the heart queen, S can concede a trick to it later|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d9|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|rnc: Oh, no...|pg||
mc|11|nt|sn00py27: she had 3 clubs - 2 spades, 1 heart and 3 diamonds = 9|pg||
nt|rnc: what happened|pg||

mb|2S|nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at|pg||
nt|mariner1: it!|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: 6N is lousy on these cards, but it might be made if declarer takes an inspired line|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mariner1: also, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates, Sharon|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: Osberg, and David Smith. Without them there would have been no broadcasts.|pg||
nt|mariner1: Thanks a lot for creating a site that is greatly appreciated by bridge lovers|pg||

nt|mariner1: last but definitely not least, thanks to all our spectators, their tips and comments|pg||
nt|mariner1: help keep us almost undefenestrated!|pg||

nt|mmmakela: lost the hearts|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@H was the spot here EW|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4 hearts very good game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|chick: by repeated spade finesses?|pg||
nt|henryb: 3N is very pessimistic with N depending on the 2N range.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|phil: for starters, and then squeezing E in the blacks|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|phil: but theres some communication issues|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|henryb: repeated spade finesses and a black suit squeeze|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mariner1: on 15 S was also unaggressive so the contract is also 3@D|pg||
nt|mariner1: that is in Open|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2 ways to guess spades|pg||
nt|henryb: 3N, on the other hand, is not terribly challenging|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mariner1: thanks all! back in 22 minutes or so|pg||
nt|mmmakela: guessed wrong|pg||
nt|bobh1: cu thx all|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ty all |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|phil: I think one of the keys is to lead a club to the King - to rectify the count if East wins and 2 tricks if he doesnt|pg||
nt|henryb: bye all|pg||
nt|phil: later|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chick: This is the last hand of this session, stay tuned for the second half in about 10 minutes|pg||

nt|marlowepi: Bill, you need to add to your list of the virtues of 6S "no D lead or D king with opening leader"|pg||
nt|athene: and no club ruff :)|pg||

mb|p|pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|athene: and lastly to BBO and of course Roland Wald who organises all these Vu-Graph presentations|pg||
nt|lestergold: well n/s have done well to stay out of game on this hnad but northn had  agame try and south an accept just  unlucky with the duplication of values on the hand|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rnc: And also to the audience for their tips...|pg||
nt|rnc: ...and to you Geoffrey|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|col3435: well this looks good for 8 tricks at the very least|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: no doubt S would have doubled 3D if she didnt like the other unbid suit even better|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thanks to Lady Milne for inspiring the eponymous trophy that crowns this event|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|lestergold: sometimesw underbidding is rewaqrdede|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: rewarded|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: well that lead solves a certain problem for declarer|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the "9th trick" problem...|pg||
nt|athene: namely, where trick number nine is coming from|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: the next match is coming up shortly - in about 30 minutes, i think|pg||
nt|sn00py27: as well as some overbidding|pg||

nt|marlowepi: tricks? S should play back Q of spades hoping for a duck (correct if spades are 5-3), then if N turns up with only four spades (by following up the line), she can shift to diamonds|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|sn00py27: all she had to do on the last was cross to dummy' ace - finesse the diamond again and claim 9|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|eggy: should hold this now as South has show 15 points|pg||
