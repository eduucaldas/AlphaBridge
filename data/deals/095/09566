mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|wygbe1: ok i see the explanation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: "Less than an opening hand". I dare say|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: 4@D and 4@S less than an opening hand |pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|super nova: Im not sure how legal this bidding is in Australia if it is known to only be a 2 count.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|super nova: There was a lot of hoo haa about this some years ago.|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i imagine 3c showed the worst possible hand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|super nova: every one had to convert the color of their system if they were known to have these style openings.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: 2NT  inquiry, not sure what 3@C shows. Any minimum perhaps|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||

mb|3S|nt|super nova: this shows 6+ h and 12-15.|pg||
nt|super nova: still 2h might do ok.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@H too much at these colours imo|pg||
nt|super nova: I agree.|pg||
nt|allanr44: pick everything, could be a make|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Suit not robust enough |pg||
nt|super nova: the meaning between bidding 2h and 3h is very close if that is they way you use it (and that is they way they use it).|pg||
nt|super nova: so not much point in bidding 3h when 2h should be a good hand anyway.|pg||
nt|allanr44: too short in entries after the heart lead, to play trumps correctly|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|super nova: Still his partner is not a passed hand,.. and would make it easier to find a game if only 1 or 2 card support in @H|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: Intermediate jump overcalls work better after 1mi  (2M) in my experience |pg||
nt|wygbe1: cashing k of clubs and leading low spade - low d from dummy, winning ace first - looks to be optimum|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||

nt|allanr44: yes|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|1N|an|comic - 15-18 bal or weak 2 |nt|super nova: 15-18 balanced or any weak 2.|pg||
nt|allanr44: still, it was a top trick better than the slams bid by a 'certain person'  :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|wygbe1: in practice, better chance of east holding club k than west holding all three honors|pg||
nt|allanr44: absolutely|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|super nova: I think Victoria has the best process of selecting a state team.|pg||
nt|super nova: Most states have some form of elimination buter.|pg||
nt|super nova: elimination over stages.|pg||
nt|wygbe1: they could  get ace of h, 2 h ruffs, 3d, club and 2 spades - 9 tricks if they defended perfectly|pg||
nt|super nova: WA is a bit different using the method where|pg||
nt|super nova: the top pair from the butler auto make the team|pg||
nt|super nova: 2nd choosed from the other top pairs to form one team.. the winning team then joins the top pair.|pg||
nt|allanr44: certainly fortunate that the @Ds run|pg||
nt|super nova: A method that was sometimes used in selecting the AUST Youth team|pg||

mc|11|nt|super nova: Here to select the top Vic team you have a 3 stage butler to choose one team.|pg||
nt|allanr44: bonus - he had 9 anyway|pg||
nt|super nova: Which will play against the winning team from the premium teams event (pennant)|pg||
nt|super nova: IN the past some players made both teams.|pg||

nt|wygbe1: low to ace loses to stiff t offside and kqtx onside|pg||
nt|allanr44: Still, on balance, I don't think the trump play was, ipso facto, a bad line.  But, as always, there are other considerations|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|wygbe1: presumably if you lead low and the ten pops you cover with j so pick up kqt onside|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|allanr44: of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: i think low to the nine may be the percentage play|pg||
pc|s9|nt|super nova: Here is golds' chance to pick up 10.|pg||
nt|wygbe1: in the trump suit, but as was pointed out you dont want spade shift|pg||
nt|allanr44: there must be a mathematician who can deal with this, in isolation of course|pg||

nt|super nova: HAHA>>>|pg||

nt|super nova: could be wrong.|pg||
nt|super nova: I will as Gold later what the process was.|pg||
nt|super nova: Even though I believe that Vic has the best process for selecting the state team|pg||
nt|super nova: other states dont like this sort of process because|pg||
nt|super nova: it can create a situation where one team gets a monopoly on the event|pg||
nt|super nova: so a lot of players dont get the experience at the national level they should/could get.|pg||
nt|super nova: I am under the impression that this is why they have for the Aust team selection Pairs one year and teams another|pg||
nt|super nova: makes it fair for the good players that cant get good team mates .. to give them a chance to play for Aust.|pg||
nt|super nova: They did well to bid 4h on that last hand|pg||
nt|super nova: 5 imps.|pg||

nt|allanr44: they wouldn't know that they were +19 this set, or maybe they would have had a go|pg||

nt|super nova: indeed.|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i would have raised one h to 3 with e hand on this one too|pg||
nt|super nova: how do you play this suit for one looser?|pg||
nt|super nova: we can all see how it 'can' be played.. |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|allanr44: I'd play for honour 10 onside|pg||

nt|super nova: They are changing the rules so this can no longer happen in Vic.|pg||
nt|allanr44: is EW a regular partnership Jamie?|pg||
nt|super nova: No|pg||
nt|allanr44: thx|pg||
nt|super nova: First time they have played together.|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: we are skipping to baord 13 - hopefully when we get back we will have some comparrisons |pg||
nt|super nova: the reason is that the pennant team was a 5 person team|pg||
nt|allanr44: so far, so good  :)|pg||
nt|super nova: and added one player from the finalists|pg||
nt|super nova: Hinge an obvious choice.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Spade ruff would have held it to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|super nova: In these situations.. may not want to take some possible safty plays|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|super nova: a number of safty playes help ensure your contract but over the long run would actually loose you imps.|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 4h is on ew|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: the h jack is a big card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On this lie 4@H is cold. Maybe Hinge is too good for 2@H. What do you think?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|super nova: Perhaps there was no other way to really show his hand in his system.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: Other than 3@H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wygbe1: the void and the side 5 card suit basically take partner out of the auction|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
nt|super nova: He may of been planning on making a theroetical undiciplined bid of 3c.. then his partner may know that he was 6/5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|super nova: or 4c if there was some competition.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|super nova: Trian Chira in an ealier  match today (playing at the other table now).|pg||
pc|c3|nt|super nova: elected to pass with 5s and 7 clubs|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|wygbe1: if he passed, pd would open 1d, he would bid 1h, pd would bid 1s, and he would probably have to bid 2h|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|hT|pc|d4|pc|s8|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|super nova: His partner couldnt really affort to make a bid at the 2 level, since he really knows they have game on.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: Easy 11 tricks. It won't be a problem to find @SQ after Hinge's weak NT|pg||
nt|wygbe1: the dbl of 2@c was takeout - many play in these run out situations the first double from either side is takeout, and successive dbls are pen|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|super nova: 3s sounds like 5,.. but he was a bit stuck.. 3c would have been a nice action then gold 3h followed by 3s then 4s|pg||
