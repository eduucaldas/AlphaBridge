nt|marlowepi: welcome back all. scotland didn't get kilt in the first half, but they do trail by the narrowest of margins|pg||
nt|viren169: hi all|pg||
nt|jallerton: Both teams still in contention|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: and we're off.|pg||
nt|eamongall: at first glance I don't see much for anyone ...|pg||
nt|eamongall: I will hazard a guess at EW playing in 1NT |pg||
nt|viren169: Off we go...|pg||
nt|mowen: Could make a difference - probably to who comes 2nd!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|viren169: Is Norman in his seat?|pg||
nt|werge: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: Morning all|pg||
nt|viren169: partscore to start off with|pg||
nt|jallerton: Welcome back|pg||
nt|mowen: hello Frances|pg||
nt|werge: Interesting board - it happens, that these minors bring in 12 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Mike here from Uk hi all|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: hi Mike from Reading England here|pg||
nt|mowen: hi all|pg||
nt|finch: Hi Steve|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone!|pg||
nt|mowen: EBU have done v well|pg||
nt|werge: hi from another kingdom|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: both pairs play strong club|pg||
mb|d|nt|jallerton: EW play strong @c|pg||
nt|mowen: I gather Garvey/Cooke have an unusual system|pg||
nt|finch: yes.  For the first board, sufficient to know that it includes a strong club|pg||
nt|finch: I have the WBF card and 43-page system file in front of me|pg||
nt|mowen: nice solid overcall by west|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@s = constructive raise, 7-10 with 3-card support|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Tim :)|pg||
nt|henryb: Hi|pg||
nt|mariner1: well we start with a slam here|pg||
nt|mariner1: only part scores though someone could get pushed up|pg||
mb|2C|nt|viren169: dreaded 4441 hand to start...|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Hans|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: Hi all|pg||
nt|finch: x was 7+ balanced|pg||
nt|mowen: allows east to muddy the waters|pg||
nt|finch: welcome also to Graham Osborne who will be with us for the first few boards|pg||
nt|mowen: hi Graham|pg||
nt|finch: The first page of the system file tells us that "the declarership can often be swtiched to either side (ideal for mixed pairs)"|pg||
nt|finch: Though I'm not sure they've ever found anyone else prepared to play the system with them!|pg||
nt|viren169: yes|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N is a forcing raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: welcome all|pg||
nt|mowen: its hard to play in the style of Martin Garvey|pg||
nt|mowen: well someone is in his seat:)|pg||
nt|rnc: Back for the 6th and last segment from the 11th Filbyter Cup, 50 IMP's to catch for Lirarna ("the Gamblers" in Swedish)|pg||
nt|rnc: Full information is find on http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc09/fc_main_en.htm|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: 3NT is a make here, but some NS might alternatively fetch up in the 4-3 spade fit|pg||
nt|finch: Never a truer word was said|pg||
nt|eamongall: For EBU we have Martin Garvey and Jon Cooke a regular pairing playing on BBO most nights with various English juniors and ex-junios|pg||
nt|viren169: Selway is there now...|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Hi Michael|pg||
nt|werge: Safety play in trumps here|pg||
nt|rnc: Hi all|pg||
nt|werge: Some misunderstanding here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot of bidding all on her own|pg||
mb|2D|nt|viren169: Interesting South did not dble weak NT|pg||
nt|viren169: Just as well!|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: transfer & delayed raise to game = mild slam try for pairs playing Texas (4-level transfer), the latter showing no slam aspirations|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are some options inb the defense and play revolving around the club suit|pg||
nt|cindy: hi all|pg||
nt|henryb: DOIGB|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@S is destined to go off...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: This is a really vital match between holders and England. If I see correctly, Derek O'Gorman and TerryWalsh are in much to my surprise as they are Trophy debutants|pg||
nt|finch: Final contract the normal one, however|pg||
nt|mowen: easy 11 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb: which stands for Down One Is Good Bridge|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure I like 2N...|pg||
nt|mowen: yup, looks like -1|pg||
nt|mariner1: K@C K@H off for NS though K@H may not come into play|pg||
nt|mariner1: -1 likely|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Bob|pg||
nt|bobh1: decent imps contract|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S and a @H back beats it 2|pg||
nt|othered1: Early @D play will beat this|pg||
nt|mcarroll: if def lead a @D at any stage before trumps are drawn dummy is dead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Staffan Hed. Go'kväll Sverige!|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Marshall Lewis and Paul Gipson|pg||
nt|jcomyn: This is a baptism of fire for them|pg||
nt|mayors: Hi Steve,Frances and Specs|pg||
nt|jallerton: With 3 diamond losers, he'll need to pick up the spades for no loser|pg||
nt|jallerton: This lead puts dec. in dummy.  Will he win and finesse spades immediately?|pg||
nt|jallerton: From dec.'s point of view, @d may be 2-2 in which case a spade loser can be afforded|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@S is enough after overcalling...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@h is possible|pg||
nt|mariner1: or even 1@S and a @H back|pg||
nt|rnc: As always... :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|paulg: Good evening everyone|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hi Roland & Paul & specs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: was 2NT something special? or intended as such? it doesn't seem to leap off the screen on the N hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N interesting,,,,,,,,, must be systemic for them|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cindy: hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi cindy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: That is Walsh not Walshe operator|pg||
nt|viren169: Cards well placed for declarer.|pg||
nt|chick: making is better :)|pg||
nt|mowen: a bit keen, I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4N key card, 5@D showing 0-3|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jallerton: 2@h transfer|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: good evening everybody, the weather is sunny and warm for the year|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry martin! -1 with right defence. after @cQ play a @d|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mariner1: aha so the 3N was specific @S shortness|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|jallerton: Cameron says S too strong for 2@s.  But no spade honours and AK d/ton|pg||
nt|eamongall: for Ireland we have Derek O Gorman ...who played in World Pairs Final back in 1990 as a 20 year old  but has been retired since about 1993 from serious bridge |pg||
nt|ppiglett: West missed the suit pref card of the 6D|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: wanted to set up his spades if pd had xx|pg||
nt|eamongall: and his partner Terry Walsh who is well known on the Dublin bridge scene..|pg||
nt|eamongall: both making their Camrose debut |pg||
nt|eamongall: I take a point from the gallery ...."Camrose is not serious bridge" ...  I think the players involved are taking it seriously |pg||
nt|sybarra: had to eat a club also |pg||
nt|sybarra: -2 looks right |pg||
nt|mariner1: well -1 now|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes we seemed to have "wrong side" the next lead |pg||
nt|mariner1: the @H losers disappear on the @c|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer will be uncomfortable in 2N but will eventually come up with 8 tricks!|pg||
nt|viren169: bit too much to drink?|pg||
nt|mariner1: very well bid, now to make though play should be fairly quick|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks looks easy|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes and should make 13 in fact|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jallerton: S was never going to find @cK lead at trick 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: the lucky lead the favourable lie oft he sapdes looks like will see this soemwhat shaky 3n home|pg||
nt|lestergold: and problem is that south doesnt know about the diamonds actuilly held by north|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: odd not to cash a top club before the third spade|pg||
nt|henryb: well on this hand N-S would make 3@c for 110, and 3@h will lose two diamonds and one of each for -50|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Agreed about the S but one off is a f|pg||
nt|ppiglett: good plan|pg||
nt|mariner1: been trying to come up with some brilliant reason why it should  be obvious for E|pg||
nt|mariner1: to return a @H,,,,,, have yet to come up with something even I would believe :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well some of those 50 imps could be earned here|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h2|pc|dJ|nt|mowen: bit early for too much to drink:)-2 now I fear, with 3 trump losers...|pg||
nt|viren169: Surprized Pat did not consider tapping it on the way out...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but declarer made ih himself|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Trus Ralf|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The right play is to cash @cA and @cK and then @d|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|hT|nt|eamongall: Thomas Hanlon indicates its time for a comeback ....however I edited his comment |pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|jcomyn: somehow I dont think this is right|pg||
nt|lestergold: i own club in london|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry that was meant to be private|pg||
nt|jallerton: too late, you have told us all now!|pg||
nt|lestergold: i had a private message and was replying to a kibbutzer and pressed wrong thing im always doing it|pg||
nt|lestergold: any case no secret its on my stats in any case|pg||

pc|h5|nt|ralfwil: which also will fail|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s8|pg||
nt|henryb: and two imps is two imps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: When S did´nt lead a trunph yes|pg||
nt|rnc: NS (and EW) are playing strong 1@C with neb 1@D. Here N's DBL must show the unbal hand with @D. |pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: north has a good chance of making the ace of trumps but not too many others|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: south doesnt want to povide declarer with any losing options!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: claim coming |pg||

pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: it would be possible to go down on this hand playing W for club length, as N is cursed with the 7 of diamonds (E has the official Curse of Scotland)|pg||
nt|rnc: This is psychologically good for Lirarna (and vice versa for HOUSE)|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|paulg: nothing too frightening to report so far, i guess|pg||
mb|d|nt|bjacobs: I won't, but I cannot promise it of one of the other commentators|pg||

nt|paulg: Good morning everyone|pg||
mb|2C|nt|aupillon: the opening in North is forbidden in the French Alps |pg||
nt|mdgraham: good afternoon all.|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: good competitive board to wake everyone up|pg||
nt|paulg: Both pairs are playing 5-card majors and a strong 1NT|pg||
nt|paulg: Grant and Macdonald need little excuse to bid, as I'm sure we'll see|pg||
nt|paulg: they play 4-card minors and a weak 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: here we have a completly untried partnership representing Ireland - amazing|pg||
nt|aupillon: it's curious. Neither line found their 4/4 major fit |pg||
nt|capercliff: hi folks|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: did he really start with 3 @C ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: SHE|pg||

pc|d2|nt|odysseus69: ok now|pg||
nt|paulg: both pairs play 5-card majors and a strong 1NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hello all and welcome back to Limerick|pg||
pc|dK|nt|paulg: another example of how easy it is to lose the club suit these days|pg||
nt|odysseus69: any case for spade to 8 or jack first?|pg||
nt|toobad: no|pg||
nt|paulg: hi Mike|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: I learned this type of attitude here in Aus, but I could never apply it :)|pg||
nt|paulg: lead of the @dQ asks for reverse attitude, although Greenwood might think it's from shortage|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Marian|pg||
nt|mdgraham: big deficit for Wales to attempt to overcome|pg||
nt|paulg: both playing 4-card minors and a weak 1NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Mike fromEngland here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's two of us, then |pg||
nt|lestergold: two Mikes mayv 2 too many|pg||
pc|dA|nt|capercliff: oh I see:)|pg||
nt|aupillon: One does double in East or say 1NT ?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|odysseus69: quick no|pg||
nt|paulg: i think 1NT gets the hand over immediately|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|odysseus69: at least worth a slow no|pg||
nt|toobad: this will take a bit of time now!!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: with what sounded like a 4-4 spade fit not clear that East should start with diamond|pg||
nt|chessmaste: No need to double with a balanced hand|pg||
nt|aupillon: good style. i absolutely agree|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c9|pc|d7|nt|dan_hohor: if Traian does a mistake , I throw him at least a diry look :) and he does the same if I do a booboo|pg||

pc|d9|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||

pc|c5|nt|Walddk4: Commentary in Gaelic required in this room (will be nice and quiet then I suspect)|pg||
nt|aupillon: North opening bid impressed me. Not knowing them, is their style VERY agressive ?|pg||
nt|paulg: yes, it is|pg||
nt|aupillon: thank you|pg||
pc|c2|nt|paulg: although I'd open it too, points in long suits, etc|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d8|nt|toobad: good try from Lady Di|pg||
nt|capercliff: why is this hand being played out?|pg||
nt|aupillon: How time changes... At first 13, later 12, etc. And now with 10...Getting oldern anyway|pg||
nt|paulg: a quiet hand to get everyone into the match|pg||
nt|lestergold: well more than one way to skin a cat i suppose|pg||
pc|dT|nt|odysseus69: oops|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unenviable choice for West|pg||

nt|jcomyn: must be a test run|pg||
nt|mowen: 11 tricks what a shock|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@s or 4@s opener?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: two off would have been better with the club switch!|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Peter Goodman from Wales|pg||
nt|mariner1: "it might be worth a shot" does not quite live up to brilliance|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: http://www.ebu.co.uk/internationals/Camrose2009Results.htm  for results and standing after round 1 (including carryover from the first weekend)|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@C here|pg||
nt|mayors: 6! s looks good e/w till you see the break|pg||
nt|mariner1: well this would be a close match except for the digit issue House has.........|pg||
mb|1D|nt|paulg: Spears and Murdoch are both experienced players but a relatively new partnership|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we can see that S made a correct evaluation of the slam potential of the S hand even facing a weak NT on that deal by observing that if the 2 black queens in the N hand were ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: instead the ace of clubs, slam would be a favorite|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@d 10-15, no 5-card major|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: hm, W has written down +100 ... Cooke has -50|pg||
nt|viren169: another 4@S destined to go off...|pg||

nt|mariner1: Results|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: in effect, the fourth spade squeezed E (non-materially) out of the club spot which would have given S a losing option in the play|pg||
nt|viren169: guess in spades for overtrick|pg||
nt|mowen: now Shields/Denning chance to show their strong club|pg||
nt|finch: Yes, it's huge|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Peter :)|pg||
nt|viren169: Light opening... yet again!|pg||
nt|werge: WHAT a mis-fit|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: the goulash dealer at work!|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: I doubt they can make it however with South being short in both clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|mowen: looks like it|pg||
nt|bobh1: another good game that the gods are conspiring against|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: but will stay till then|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning |pg||

nt|lestergold: now e/w in dangerous watyers|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: not sure i would be leaping over 1S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S is worth more than 2D but is hoping to be able to bid spades at a convenient level so making a slight tactical underbid|pg||
nt|lestergold: Howard's spade overall at unfavourable vulnerability was not recopmmended by my freat grandmother|pg||
nt|mayors: yes would agree|pg||
nt|mowen: I know players who would have bid S@s as south|pg||
nt|finch: The system cards are at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|sybarra: can W pass? |pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: predictable lead giving a much needed trick|pg||
nt|jallerton: win in hand and play @sQ.  West needs to duck this|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer will win in hand and try a spade which west has to duck to ensure the killing of the suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes though a defense slip might allow 4@S if they get there|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mariner1: does not seem likely though|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: sorry Jeffery snp|pg||
nt|finch: EW play a more natural style of strong club, 1NT was FG balanced and 2@H natural|pg||
nt|jcomyn: h well placed for 3N  but willbe in 4S|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@c = relay .  I think 2NT is too.|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good day from sunny vancouver|pg||
nt|finch: 2NT showed a doubleton heart, 3@S natural and 4@C a cue for spades|pg||
nt|mowen: and so to 6@S but can they make it?|pg||
nt|eamongall: this appears to have 3 tricks to lose|pg||
nt|mowen: tempting at this vul|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Do you agree with P on E? I vote for 1@s|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW could have played @S yes|pg||
nt|bobh1: staying in 3@s should be worth some imps|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: hi martin|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: with balance of points with n/s and cards ready ti spit at them|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: i don;t understand that double at all|pg||
nt|ppiglett: A little unlucky|pg||
nt|eamongall: he has the none working @S finesse ..available |pg||
nt|eamongall: for a @H pitch|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Cooke looking at @hJ|pg||
nt|henryb: really, the false preference! they must promise 5+ clubs for this auction|pg||
nt|chick: many people these days are playing that 1@S shows an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|petepunt: yes rebids 1nt with bal 15-17 even with 4@S|pg||
nt|othered1: high @S lead will make this easy for declarer (who had 7 tricks even on a low lead)|pg||
nt|rnc: North and South are discussing wether North now had promised @D, in my opinion yes. Why else bid? An 11-13 BAL with a passed partner cannot profitably bid on her own|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|sharkirl: reprieve|pg||
nt|viren169: Now N/S will be going to the races... |pg||
nt|viren169: Somebody ought to tell Norman he is not as young as he use to be!|pg||
nt|sybarra: undoubled if that is a victory |pg||
nt|werge: Diud´nt North see the bidding?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they sat no bubble no hubble|pg||
nt|werge: Did´nt|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean no double no trubble|pg||
pc|d8|nt|james_h: Operator please Click on North and change to 'Walsh'|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 club tricks now one spade and one heart thats 5 tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: h lead might have caused problems this wont|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why not a small @s with no entrance?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: N didn't double, and S has close to zero defense|pg||
pc|dA|nt|paulg: i don't really understand North's pass .. no reason for this to be forcing is there?|pg||
nt|finch: In the England match against NI, Townsend has gone two off in 6@S when we rose with the ace of hearts on a heart lead|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes now may make overtrick(s)|pg||
nt|rnc: gulasch hand yes|pg||
nt|werge: If yoe do not - noe and then - pay 550/750, you have´nt doubled enough|pg||
nt|rnc: thought you ment the champagne bubbles...:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: playing in a misfit 3n ubndoubnled on combined 18 count what happened to the aggressive lady |pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Geoffrey |pg||
nt|rnc: hi |pg||
nt|sybarra: North really doesnt want to lead |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|jcomyn: are we on together James|pg||
nt|viren169: with Q of @S instead of Q@D 7 is a good contract|pg||
nt|sharkirl: may well bid 7|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to find out about the Q of @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: mybe an endplay against eat at some point form a sixth trick but seven looks unlikely|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 50 imps in 16 bds is tough|pg||
pc|dK|nt|eamongall: split trump honors was required ...so unlucky|pg||
nt|henryb: but in that style South should respond 1@h, not 1@d|pg||
nt|petepunt: n/s weak nt |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|barbyh: das it, you it|pg||
nt|james_h: thanks operator!|pg||
pc|d9|nt|cindy: its not forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: none at all|pg||
nt|viren169: 5@S is 2 with Q|pg||
nt|mowen: don't thik it is possible with south only holding 2 clubs |pg||
nt|eamongall: and the 10 onside contributes our Sydney correspondant Thomas Hanlon|pg||
nt|eamongall: and as maker64 indicates the @D5 can gorw |pg||
nt|ciaran: Promoted a third trump there by overtaking the @D6 if that's how play went|pg||
nt|eamongall: gorw|pg||
nt|lestergold: best defence holds it to 4 0r 5 off|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@C probably denies any kings|pg||
nt|jallerton: Even on a @h lead, declarer will test the spades, see S show out and take rthe marked finesse|pg||
nt|eamongall: grow |pg||
nt|ppiglett: We've all been in worse - Tom?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: endplay inevitable really|pg||
nt|jallerton: Eastshort of exits|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Small @S lead would be my choice|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, east will have no trouble if @C comes back, no choice but K|pg||
pc|h2|nt|james_h: Pat is hoping Adam will wake up with the Q@S|pg||
nt|viren169: N is still none the wiser...|pg||
nt|lestergold: the lead helps declarer considerably|pg||
nt|rnc: I think some 10 of them went away on bd 17|pg||
pc|s3|nt|paulg: @hK would test North|pg||
nt|james_h: thats why Pat used 5NT|pg||
nt|finch: you might be able to do it if South is something like 5314, but even then I think you need slightly better spade pips|pg||
nt|finch: I shall be surprised if this is not a flat board, +- the odd 50 points|pg||
nt|mowen: bridge can be a hard game|pg||
nt|henryb: indeed, but still, if North will rebid 1N with a balanced 15-17, you lose the value of opening 1@c with a strong NT when South does not respond 1@h and North will not rebid 1@h ...|pg||
nt|henryb: with 4|pg||

pc|h3|nt|james_h: Morning John|pg||
nt|viren169: yes|pg||
pc|s7|nt|paulg: you have to guess the spades in 5@d to make, although you are favourite to do so|pg||
nt|paulg: North's lack of a double may work to his advantage here|pg||
nt|paulg: as I expect Spears will eventually play the @sK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: strange bidding & strange defense|pg||
nt|lestergold: club bad|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade needed|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

nt|viren169: Espen wont be too happy with the result... although after passing... 4@S will still be reached.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|viren169: declarer will eliminate the hand and end up hooking the spade Q when nothing else works.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|finch: fantasy question: can EW make 6@C?  Slightly less fantasy question: can they make 6@H?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think he will tahe his tricks outside @c|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: and he can endplay east again|pg||

nt|petepunt: u will plat 1n with 44 major fits yes|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N now has no choice except @C |pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Geoffrey Wolfarth|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: and strange line of play for that matter|pg||
nt|lestergold: east should have seen the position|pg||
nt|finch: double dummy, 6@S was makeable.  But cashing one top spade was too late, so no-one will make at the table|pg||
nt|mowen: how?|pg||

nt|lestergold: must have seen that he was going to be dobbed in again|pg||

nt|aupillon: aha|pg||

mb|2D|nt|dan_hohor: uh, I would open strong|pg||

nt|Walddk5: You don't defend with that hand|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: if she does not with that hand .....|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: Not the strongest opener in the world from Martin|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, in these days of emaciated openings and wafer-thin responses, you have to bid else you can be stolen blind |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Undo Traian, please|pg||

nt|rednaxela: Good morning everyone.|pg||
nt|paulg: hi Alex|pg||

nt|odysseus69: sorry - you are right|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dan_hohor: 3 looser hand !|pg||

nt|bobholl: west won't like a 13 in @S@H and a correction to 3@H :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not clear how EW can contest this - perhaps East might double 2@D, but there is no guarantee that they can make anything |pg||
pc|d6|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cuttysark: Ns have 7 top winners now - the question is, can they unscramble them|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Scotland could play 1NT at both tables.  East is likely to pass in the other room.|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|dan_hohor: yes Bill, but 7-5 stay well alive :)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s5|pg||

mb|p|nt|mayors: To make 6@s on previous board is completely DD|pg||

nt|eamongall: Peter ...as you can see tonk can be used as a description of double as well |pg||
nt|ppiglett: rdble - tonk tonk then?|pg||
nt|eamongall: you can have takeout tonks ..competitive tonks and lead directing tonks and penalty tonks |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: the Eng-Sco result could be good for EBU, who play Scotland in the last match|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3@C shows much more here|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this is difficult|pg||
nt|rnc: this might give the show away|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed my thoughts exactly|pg||
nt|rnc: For sure W will lead a minor now|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to attack a minor|pg||
nt|lestergold: then clubs |pg||
mb|p|nt|jferg: the n.i pair play a strong club system with 14 16 no trump|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is this a weak no trump pair for N ireland|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok|pg||
nt|viren169: not sure what South was planning... but it has turned a plus score to a minus!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably the cheapest with pass|pg||

nt|mariner1: N should boost to 5,,,,, not a real defensice hand, yet..........|pg||
nt|mariner1: defensive|pg||
nt|sybarra: he could even bid 5 @C on the way?|pg||
nt|othered1: At least they managed to bail out at a low level with the cards not friendly at all.|pg||
nt|rnc: let's see...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: east has to return a H right?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|james_h: Terry passing the buck|pg||
nt|lestergold: at t5his vulernability i would have ventured 2c by south|pg||
nt|othered1: That's the best west could do.  Those who take out takeout doubles would be punished here|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzkp: you can also have insufficient tonks|pg||
nt|viren169: S may tap in on the way out!|pg||
nt|viren169: He has seen 3rd in hand openings before...|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mowen: the Sing Q@H is useful|pg||
nt|finch: did you work that out all on your own?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Heart leads will promote @sQ.  However, with @cK onside that is it for the defence|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Did well to buy this one|pg||
nt|mowen: kindly minor breaks|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cards lay as you would place them |pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard to use jumps by opener if 12-14, but if 14-16 ok. still, does S jump every time he has a 4 card fit?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good shot by Terry|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like e/w are overboard|pg||
nt|henryb: Much more after partner bids 2@d? I think that W hand makes up in playing strength and controls what it lacks in high cards|pg||
nt|chick: E may not be sure if 5@C is a slam try, lead directing, or offer of another place to play|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcomyn: well he cant like the S suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: even after the lead-directing 1@d opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: that lead lookds costly but actually there is always one dim loser|pg||
nt|chick: fortunately, his 5@H bid is right in all those cases|pg||
pc|c7|nt|james_h: a try scored ... now for the crutial conversion|pg||

nt|lestergold: i still say that south should hav ebid 2c- if nothing else it would have hlped the defence bhere|pg||
nt|jallerton: they may not play 2@c as natural here|pg||
nt|lestergold: that would explain things|pg||
nt|jallerton: quite a few pairs play it as some major suit take-out|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate east seems to be a long time in the tank|pg||
nt|henryb: whatever it is with no aces East can only bid 5@h|pg||
nt|petepunt: townsend gold in silver medal eng bejing team last oct 5@C will show about this|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ciaran: safe trip - talk to you later in the week..  wd in teams|pg||
nt|ciaran: sorry - private|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: claimed on the spot "unless you're ruffing"|pg||
nt|ciaran: 3H was likely to be beaten by repeated spade leads promoting the @HJ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcomyn: this will test Derek|pg||
nt|finch: 9 tricks, losing two spades a diamond and a heart|pg||
nt|mowen: unless west plays a @S|pg||
nt|eamongall: http://www.agcrump.com/tonk.htm     you can even download Tonk |pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: i think n/s may find this ok|pg||
nt|ralfwil: That´s not my lead. Ruffs when I have a good 5-card trumph? |pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|jferg: they jump with min and a 4 card fit, bid a weak suit with a max|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jcomyn: well done already|pg||
nt|viren169: small @S would have been better|pg||
nt|mariner1: claim coming pull trumps and its over|pg||
nt|mariner1: could be a big swing there|pg||
nt|mariner1: Shirley he could have indeed|pg||
pc|h4|nt|viren169: Looks like declarer didn't believe N either!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: looks very top-end for a mixed raise, but probably not quite a limit raise either. still, i would hesitate to bid only 2H with a stiff spade (even the king) in a hand that has a ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: high offense-to-defense ratio. nothing matters on this deal, of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes seems counter-intuitive|pg||
nt|othered1: did west show @C with the 2@C bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: 2@C showed 4+H and another suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: no looked a singleton obviously|pg||
nt|werge: Normally his cards show you the answer|pg||
nt|lestergold: too slow this defence a heart can be establisghed now to take care of the third club|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think you can afford jump raises when not vulnerable, but should avoid vul or min|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ppiglett: Defence missed their chance with five minor winners and a diamond thru to promote the J|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: on min|pg||
nt|henryb: well done. If you did not cash it you would lose it|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no ruff! Discard a @h!|pg||
pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: heart queen next|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ciaran: going to run into a club overruff or run out of tricks if he draws trumps|pg||
nt|roswolf: he can eliminate and endplay - but perhaps not now|pg||
nt|lestergold: its always a make if defence dont attack clubs quickly|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jcomyn: yes hope he sees that|pg||
pc|h7|nt|othered1: I'm not sure with this vulnerabiltiy, that seeing the west hand answers anything.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|fabsayc: still ok but not optimum line|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe he should not have touched trump|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|viren169: Operator... did the 1@H bid ever happen?|pg||
nt|viren169: or was it our imagination?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: yes ..it did.....and not a murmur from E|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|werge: That was what I meant...|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s2|nt|jferg: end played now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: really?|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed endplay!|pg||
nt|roswolf: west was done in but........|pg||
nt|rnc: I think East should have realised that a club shift was very much needed.|pg||
nt|lestergold: a simple hand to analyse a difficult hand to defend|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes he should have no other defence made any sense|pg||
nt|rnc: With the 3@H-bid in mind|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: South can always ruff 2 diamonds, then AK of C and another C?|pg||
nt|lestergold: the heart suit was too threatening|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, i guess this was the general plot|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed steffan|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|werge: You remarked the word normally!|pg||

nt|bjacobs: 6@C is not a great contract ... I'd be very cautious about taking aim at the N/S bidding|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: it is getting closer and closer :)|pg||
nt|lethal666: predict that is|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: true , only 40% ( clubs 2-2 )|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: I wonder what would be Leigh choice for the playoffs....|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Hi folks|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone @H|pg||
nt|rnc: Hi|pg||
nt|jcomyn: John Comyn here While we have the time, let me inform the kibitzers that the Ireland team is changed drastically. Three of the original team of 5 have cried off for one reason and ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another and have been replaced by three members of the team which finished third. Accordingly our B team will be hot favourites here. |pg||
nt|capercliff: but + scores are good|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed but they ae at green so have leeway|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, at 50 down I suppose you are allowed a little latitude|pg||
nt|lestergold: and as u say wont catch up 50 imps by not b idding|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: that was quick|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jcomyn: Grainne Barton, Maria Barry and Valerie Hand are replaced by Patricia Kelly, Sandra Newell and Gilda Pender. Why 5 we will never know|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Sorry, showing my inexperience, perhaps.|pg||
nt|paulg: perhaps Greenwood had actually pitched a spade? Or Adamson cashed the club at the end and not the diamond|pg||
nt|aupillon: maybe on open S hand too|pg||
nt|capercliff: it is E thinking here|pg||
nt|aupillon: I demand political asylum there, to learn this way. It's enchanting, really|pg||
nt|capercliff: not N|pg||
nt|paulg: i bet Lee expected to bid on this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Surnames only operator please|pg||
nt|Walddk5: There is not enough room for first names|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ok|pg||
nt|Walddk5: What is South's last name?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: ah, Newell|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just informing the kibitzers|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3NT a possibility|pg||
nt|capercliff: I might have bid 3N rather than X|pg||
nt|aupillon: South opened. How many diamonds now ?|pg||
nt|capercliff: but it is an awkward hand|pg||
nt|aupillon: you can tell this :)|pg||
nt|paulg: might bid 5@d, as partner had 4@c for the majors|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lethal666: im keeping that close to my chest. but i do have a preference|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Very wise.  Because if your preferred team makes it, your opinion would give them particular motivation|pg||
nt|paulg: will south protect?|pg||
nt|toobad: maybe......... but not what we were shown|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: pretty maximum looking 1NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good 2NT bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: well upgrade for the long diamonds of course|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugrapha3: Leigh is a wise captain....|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: looks right to do so|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: Kirby should bid now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and McMahon 4|pg||
nt|chick: once W passed a chance to bid after the double, I'd sure bid more than 2@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Hi Cornelia|pg||
nt|chick: Hi :)|pg||
nt|rnc: East must be delighted to get support here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hate that 1NT by S in teams|pg||
nt|bobholl: what's wrong with 1@D ?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not because you can make anything, but because you might push them up|pg||
nt|paulg: yes, a double followed by a scrambling 2NT would see them find the diamond fit ... and probably push them up|pg||
nt|aupillon: when you bid this way, you have to play well too|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and as cards lie infrangible|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they are solid, too - it just takes a bit of time to get to the point where they are solid |pg||
nt|lestergold: unless west plays something offkey|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcomyn: Juxta position in this match. Our B team are favourtites|pg||
nt|bobholl: the old problem with 1@D 2@C :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: south did well to invite - i confess I would have passed|pg||
pc|h6|nt|paulg: yes, i'd have passed too|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however I would have upgraded the NBorth hand|pg||
nt|paulg: agreed|pg||
nt|paulg: @dQ looks attractive lead now|pg||
nt|toobad: well Ciara knows they are behind in the match, so being pushy and she should be rewarded with a positive result|pg||
nt|paulg: With Guy and Punch sitting N/S in the other room I am not concerned about them missing 3NT here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not solid really - West has to decide how to play the clubs|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|paulg: on the other hand, if partner cannot bid over 1@C ...?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no point in spade lead knowing pd has singleton at most|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|chick: Is this your A or B team we are watching?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chick: or is it your A team morphed into the B?  :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the A team is NS and the B team EW, but our A team was decimated during the week|pg||
nt|jcomyn: only 2 left from the original 5 who won the trials|pg||
nt|toobad: and after Diane's play on board one, strike while you are hot|pg||
nt|odysseus69: of course dummy liable to have 4 diamonds and possibly 5 which explains the delay|pg||
nt|aupillon: Good remark with 3NT reopening Cliff|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jcomyn: suppose so but the lead helps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: three rounds of clubs and trouble|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but it would be offkey to play for anything other thyan the drop|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rednaxela: Perhaps Madden is still feeling the effects of the 800 on board 1.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cuttysark: Well, she might have clubs - this is BetterMinor land|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: for those unaware of the story - Ireland has 2 teams as the host country|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wow!|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h4|nt|lethal666: Whichever way it goes now in this tight match, Either team will be better for this experiance, while the butler team has had no real practice at all|pg||
nt|paulg: difficult for Macdonald to read West's distribution|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: why? There are five out|pg||
nt|lestergold: 9 clubs Mike betwen the twohands|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sorry, I can't count. Been a long day|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h2|nt|capercliff: yes no reason not to think her P has the @d lenght|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: thats my privelege failing to count ur not allowed to usurp me|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bobholl: this wont cost too much partials enough for ew :)|pg||
nt|paulg: actually the odds are on the drop, but not so heavily that playing against the odds when 50 down is a reasonable play to get IMPs back|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d3|nt|paulg: i think it is the difference between international and club play ... at the club, you'd be afraid that the opponents have missed game and you might push them into it ....|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 2@s is a comfrotable spot on this trump layout: 3@S would not be|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|bobholl: will even make now :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dan_hohor: probably after 4S the best would be 4NT ( the old blackwood ) and after 5D - bid 6C to give pa a choice|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeed I dont believe it though|pg||
nt|capercliff: then again she knows that 41h is probable|pg||
pc|h9|nt|paulg: on this stage they will always bid a thin game|pg||
nt|odysseus69: great match point score for N/S |pg||
nt|capercliff: @h|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bobholl: me too don't believe @H Q|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|lestergold: sure Paul but not wehn theyve done well to bid the game in the first place|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|capercliff: -1 now|pg||
nt|aupillon: the harder they come, the harder they fall ( Jimmy Cliff)|pg||
nt|paulg: it always looked like -1, but a small loss might be the winner here|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jcomyn: that really is bad defence|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzmn: lost play|pg||
nt|aupillon: next ( as Joey Silver says)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: that's ok, Mike - I'll do the miscounting and you can stick to the spelling mistakes :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: if 5C comes just bid 5D|pg||

nt|fabsayc: what error, the heart was a real endplay|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry i meant macbeth|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: just claimed directly, giving 5 minor tricks|pg||
nt|ciaran: Yes - tough to find a minor lead from N|pg||
nt|ppiglett: agreed|pg||
nt|mowen: Shields certainly was slow...|pg||
nt|viren169: More importantly did Norman see it?|pg||
nt|mowen: Norman seen it all before:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: as we said, not as big a disaster as it could have been|pg||
nt|othered1: This isn't necessarily bad for EW.  If NS bid game in other room only 5 imps.  And there's the potential that -590 will pick up imps, perhaps many|pg||
nt|mariner1: bid;em all here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 7N easy|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes a simple elim and endplay works because trumops break 2/2|pg||
nt|roswolf: 11 imps gained on 17|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jferg: 4s again|pg||
nt|ciaran: Had chances then alright|pg||
nt|lestergold: well missed the detail|pg||
nt|lestergold: pity|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning Ciaran|pg||
nt|chick: there is a theory about when opponents make a slam try and stop in 5 ... cash your 2 aces because that's all your going to get :)|pg||
nt|viren169: I guess so!|pg||
nt|bobh1: 15 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: now another distributional hand for n/s|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think north/southcan make a game|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: well, it was a play at the end, yes. but if E wins heart ace and leads a club at that point, declarer is down in cold contract|pg||
nt|mayors: Very thin 4@h NS|pg||
nt|ciaran: Hi John|pg||
nt|viren169: nice dble to show both majs|pg||
nt|werge: Here 11 tricks in a @H-contract should be easy|pg||
nt|roswolf: are n/s playing strong club?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well maybe 5c now it cna be played by north|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: 1@c lead directional and not expecting to bid again|pg||
nt|mowen: how strong?|pg||
nt|finch: yes, a 9-count opposite a strong NT is likely to bid it, however|pg||
nt|finch: 1NT is 14-16 in 3rd and 4th seats|pg||
nt|mayors: @s lead should beat it|pg||
nt|henryb: that assumes that 5@c was a slam try|pg||
mb|2D|nt|marlowepi: if S had been 4531 on that hand, W would have had to return the heart queen after taking the D ace|pg||
nt|paulg: South was 4531|pg||
nt|marlowepi: excellent 3rd seat 1C bid by E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes paul, sorry, i meant, without the Q of diamonds|pg||
nt|barbyh: north is surely shut out now|pg||
nt|paulg: tough for South to introduce hearts now|pg||
nt|cindy: not if N makes neg dbl|pg||
nt|jferg: agree|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mm wont do his confidence much good|pg||
nt|ciaran: 6D makes here on the lucky spade position |pg||
nt|jallerton: Do you agree with 1@h or prefer 1NT?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: TONK|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: said and done!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: wow, the Tonk - "the ultimate opponent"? find that hard to believe at first glance|pg||
nt|chick: doesn't matter much what it meant, same defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Looks right for declarer to take @C play right away (after pitching @C on @DA)|pg||
nt|mariner1: E hesitated too long :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: belabored auction|pg||
mb|3C|nt|cindy: not neg|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no marshall, still making 4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could have made 5|pg||
nt|ciaran: in fact with all th heart tricks, the spade position in unnecessary|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what does S do now|pg||
nt|sharkirl: looks like 4@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 1NT for me - God deals you 17 to bid 1NT|pg||
nt|henryb: Can N-S sell to the doomed 5@c?|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@C opening on last hand would imply that|pg||
nt|roswolf: might be difficult to reach 4@H now|pg||
nt|werge: My two grandmothers play natural - they would bid 4 @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: N/S play strong club|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: the @dJ denied the @dQ on the previous board, so Spears knew the situation|pg||
nt|jferg: looks like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|viren169: some folks get into trouble dbling with a 4-3 in the majs!|pg||
nt|sybarra: should we say NEXT?|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc09/fc_main_en.htm  -|pg||
nt|mariner1: Tournament Site|pg||
nt|mariner1: if you have to ask it sort of removes the effect :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jcomyn: that solves that good old Black|pg||
nt|ciaran: if that is invitational, looks like a good effort|pg||
nt|mowen: north should not be too hopeful opposite 14-16|pg||
nt|finch: 2@C showed hearts, either weak or 4+ cards invitational (or stronger)|pg||
nt|ciaran: I slightly pefer 1H since you can still get to NT whereas a heart fit might be lost|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that 1D opening makes me feel a bit ill|pg||
nt|jallerton: A very good 17-count of course. |pg||
nt|ianrei: i prefer 1H - now they also play 2C|pg||

nt|werge: dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: looks like declarer will get the trumps right and come to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sharkirl: agree|pg||
nt|viren169: via 5@S + 4@C + 1@H|pg||
nt|sharkirl: line taken should be high @C, AK@S |pg||
nt|viren169: I am sure Brunner will be itching to play a @D as soon as she gets in.|pg||
nt|lestergold: a no prob 4s here|pg||
nt|henryb: Looks like Wales could win with a blitz and a big Scottish win|pg||
nt|othered1: possible that all good hands have to go through 2@D, not necessarily a positive feature of the system.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I like dummt!|pg||
mb|4D|nt|cindy: if W had raised clubs, N could make resp dbl|pg||
nt|jcomyn: re-wind now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and 5S re-bubbled|pg||
nt|james_h: odd double considering he is on lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: big chance here|pg||
nt|james_h: Derek thinks oh No!|pg||
nt|eamongall: who would that be now ....Tonk Hamman ? |pg||
nt|eamongall: or Tonk Helness the ultimate opponent|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: that sounds better. Meanwhile, Cooke is wishing he hadn't reopened.|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Tonk Diamond - it works wonders!|pg||
nt|henryb: Would need to win by about 70|pg||
nt|viren169: Pass seem better over 2@S...|pg||
nt|rnc: 3NT (preferably by N) if declarer guesses the @C-suit right, 4@S on dbldummy yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt may well make as well|pg||
nt|lestergold: not likely in practice tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: now W is on the horns|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like best declarer can do is drop he @HJ to escape for -2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jcomyn: will he X that as well|pg||
nt|sharkirl: yes|pg||
nt|jallerton: Easier to play in 3NT if you overcall 1NT though|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this will be fun|pg||
nt|werge: Might be 13 IMP´s for my family scoring 650|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd feel uncomfortable not getting AK10xx in a major into the auction.|pg||
nt|rnc: Nope|pg||
nt|roswolf: academic now|pg||
nt|lestergold: will the sharpshootring lady go 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N a bit thin to double, with a terrible suit, no fit & only 6 HCP . OK at the 2 level but not at the 3 level, esp. vul|pg||
nt|paulg: when you open with that rubbish in the East seat, with only 3 major cards, you do not expect to play the contract|pg||
nt|othered1: Opening bid and lead make it very likely !@CA is onside|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: yes|pg||
nt|mowen: will do well to get close to this|pg||
nt|henryb: and have Scotland win by about 50|pg||
nt|henryb: all very unlikely, but still possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: no|pg||
nt|james_h: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone work out 5Sxx+1|pg||
nt|mowen: has a chance with no @S lead|pg||
nt|mayors: They have to lead spade to beat it, otherwise with @D guess makes|pg||
nt|jallerton: unlilely that partner has a diamond stop|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Cooke checking signals now|pg||
nt|eamongall: Peter not everybody would remember Double Diamond ...it was a beer I think |pg||
nt|werge: It seems more logical to show the @H-suit insyead of @D |pg||
pc|cA|nt|barbyh: todays his lucky day|pg||
nt|ciaran: selway now wishing he had doubled! will soon be glad he did not!|pg||

nt|jcomyn: lot of bidding on that lot|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Agreed - three hearts a spade and a club|pg||
nt|mariner1: and with E having only 1@S there is no threat of a @c ruff now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Also as E has shown @hAK|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cindy: right but N should be willing to play 2S  not to go to 3 level though|pg||
nt|ciaran: if hearts are raised, you can try NT next|pg||
nt|jcomyn: question is would Carroll have x 1NT|pg||
nt|ciaran: I expect he would, but Garvey would pull to 2D|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: brilliant|pg||
nt|viren169: Not much extra for East's hand? Any views?|pg||
nt|rnc: Exactly. But 5@C might make, now since N is declaring|pg||
nt|lestergold: eggsactly|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|rnc: And now for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: it cant really fail even without this lead|pg||
pc|c8|nt|james_h: Terry will now give out to Derek for his bidding on this hand, his play on the last and proceed to make|pg||
nt|finch: trump lead seems horribly passive|pg||
nt|finch: sorry, 2@C was normal stayman.  The system changes completely when responder is a passed hand.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @hKQ!!|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ppiglett: thanks!|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.ebu.co.uk/internationals/Camrose2009Results.htm  for results and standing after round 3 (including carryover from the first weekend)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: not you, Cooke's @hQ !|pg||
nt|ciaran: Well done.  Continuing the Q was his legitimate play, but the defense at least offered him a losing option by ducking the first @H|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ppiglett: I dont think he was flying to dummy to finesse|pg||
nt|othered1: Steffan advises that 2@H response to 2@C would be nonforcing.  Old Blue Team Club played that way, but it's proponents changed that eventually.|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may well make|pg||
nt|rnc: egg-sactly (in Easter times) :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: great effort for the strong club|pg||
nt|lestergold: certainly right sided this one!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: cos played by south it was definitely going off|pg||
nt|lestergold: on the natural dim lead|pg||
nt|rnc: Yes, no matter what lead with the friendly trump layout|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: accurate defence should simply hold it to ten tricks|pg||
nt|mayors: Spade goes on long @c with them 3-3|pg||
nt|jallerton: another heart; will declarer finesse?|pg||
nt|petepunt: will be first time Ireland not won for 4 years|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Ian Reissmann from England|pg||
nt|mowen: would never pass over 2@s, but opener might have passed...|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mayors: I think he'll get @d right on the lead  as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: might make this even!|pg||
nt|othered1: East likely would have led stiff @C, if he had had it.|pg||
nt|othered1: Sorry, it's Staffan.|pg||
nt|werge: But it´s a very bad contract - now making because of a suit 3-3 with the Queen on-side|pg||
nt|roswolf: may be not now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ciaran: club leads hold 5SXX to 11 tricks and I think he'd be leading them|pg||
nt|sharkirl: prbly @D to K now?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Yes :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|james_h: just trying to set the scene|pg||
nt|viren169: We have a few specs questioning 3@S too!|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sharkirl: nope  lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually i tyhink there is a play for an overtrick after all if declarer elminates the reds tghen plays a club to the J east will be endplayed|pg||
nt|ppiglett: The spade return was not the best and has caused this problem |pg||
pc|d2|nt|viren169: nice play|pg||
nt|viren169: caught West napping!|pg||
nt|sharkirl: :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: very true Ed|pg||
nt|roswolf: best to play a club back|pg||
pc|c2|nt|barbyh: who knew clubs cd be so premptive|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is there a 6th trick?|pg||
nt|jallerton: No|pg||
nt|ciaran: Though a minute ago, I didn't think there was a 5th trick either|pg||
nt|jallerton: EBU gained by bidding the thin game on board 1.  Ireland played in 3@s =|pg||
nt|mariner1: that looks awfully flat|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mayors: although when it comes to the guess he won't know clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|finch: well, he'll know that West didn't lead a club away from the king, how does that tell him that we would lead a diamond from the queen?|pg||
nt|finch: as you say, if West plays a diamond now he may finesse as that will generate a spade discard from table if the queen is right|pg||
nt|mowen: tough choice for west now|pg||
nt|mowen: maybe just return a club|pg||
nt|mowen: a diamond is much more likely to be from Ace than Queen|pg||
nt|chick: well, it would be more fun to have a lot closer race|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont agree with the club play it loses against k stiff|pg||
nt|rnc: The lead is down to 42 imp's now with a good board (32) in OR for the trailing team |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|viren169: easy come... easy go!|pg||
nt|finch: the diamond discard was reverse count in diamonds, I believe, or possibly suit preference|pg||
nt|mayors: Yes agree Steve.  I think he's going to make from here|pg||
nt|mowen: a good result if he does|pg||
nt|finch: counting his entries, he should win the spade in the dummy|pg||
nt|mowen: play the king to keep ace as an entry|pg||
nt|finch: if he wins in hand East can duck the second club, win the third and stick declarer in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|mayors: The lead deserves to lose a game swing|pg||
nt|finch: I agree.  |pg||
nt|mowen: is a spade obvious?|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@S doesnt show anything extra... does it?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: must be -1 now!|pg||
nt|werge: Logical lead and defence = play to UNBID suit |pg||
nt|werge: the unbid|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|paulg: the other perennial question is whether to overcall or double with 5-4 majors|pg||
nt|mowen: and which one?|pg||
nt|petepunt: Wales will still want to winnthis head to head so fun it will be :)|pg||
nt|mowen: But 2@s was not forced - W could have passed over 2@d, with such a minimum hand|pg||
pc|h7|nt|finch: I don't mind a club that much (which would not be successful) but I hate the trump lead|pg||
nt|mayors: low or J I don't mind that much|pg||
nt|finch: Jon Cooke may have decided to take the diamond finesse instead by winning hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: and also gives herself a losing option now|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: hes got enuf trumps to do it entry wise too|pg||
nt|viren169: Pass would deny a maj in my book...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|barbyh: when your sp suit is q 5th and you hts much better Im for dbling|pg||
nt|ppiglett: making|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d7|nt|mowen: wow|pg||
nt|finch: a spade back still beats it at this point|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mayors: Surely he's going to play a spade now|pg||
nt|finch: no|pg||
nt|mayors: he knows partner has @c ace|pg||
nt|finch: By the way, either Vugraph has crashed, or Robson is still thinking in 6@S on board 18|pg||
nt|mayors: I think cooke is going to finesse here|pg||
nt|mowen: will he believe he has AQ?|pg||
nt|finch: it's quite difficult to work out what West's hand might be, as this defence is very strange|pg||
nt|finch: he probably 'ought' to finesse, as that is what he had decided to play for originally|pg||
nt|mowen: well I think it does, he only has a weak NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now east can discard a @c|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|s5|nt|lestergold: maybe not|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting point... to discuss with your pd... I guess you will get different views on this one|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|viren169: now back to the 10 we had at the start!|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cindy: i usually overcall unless the 4 card suit quality is much better than 5 card suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: can/should make now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sharkirl: that has to be wrong|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|viren169: small to the K@D seemed normal|pg||
nt|sharkirl: must be J@C|pg||
nt|mowen: when you have to open a weak NT with a suit because of system & then it gets competitive, surely an early pass says this, never mind what suits you hold|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
mc|11|nt|ralfwil: But declareg got a chance|pg||

nt|jcomyn: yes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: we were right not to believe it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This could be exciting|pg||
nt|paulg: no weak 2@d available for Adamson .. so 1@d?|pg||
nt|aupillon: really. But diamonds would have been better|pg||
nt|lestergold: its not spelling its the fact that i am clumsy with my hands always have been hopeless|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok, mistyping then|pg||
nt|lestergold: i can play a beethoven piano concerto but cant do anything else accurate with my hands|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bjacobs: But apart from that, good idea :)|pg||
nt|chick: hard to imagine they wouldnt ... even 6N is icy|pg||
nt|rnc: Most likely uncontested auction, so I presume they'll reach slam one way or another|pg||
nt|jcomyn: first bif test|pg||

nt|paulg: hi John|pg||
nt|paulg: Andrei, you may be even more amused by the other table on board 1 ... EW found their 4-4 major fit, and then decided to play in their 4-3 diamond fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: @S @C battle |pg||
nt|rednaxela: Good morning|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is what Wales need -  a possible slam|pg||
nt|paulg: good time to overbid|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: no battle now|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sheila ploughs a lonely furrow - when she opens the bidding she has an opening bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnc: Do we know anything about NS sys?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|dan_hohor: even if 1 ace is the A of @s you might get a spade lead anyhow on the bidding :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: migth stop just in time (bad weak two)|pg||
nt|aupillon: NO ?!|pg||
mb|p|nt|dan_hohor: hey, less than 20 imps diff|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not me|pg||
nt|lestergold: played by east 6d is an excellent slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I could play one too, but I might not get the notes in the right order  |pg||
mb|3C|nt|jcomyn: but I would not agree with 1C|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 1NT-1|pg||
nt|paulg: 1@d or 1NT?|pg||
nt|capercliff: i like 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|lethal666: Well I make Caplan 1 imp ahead by my caculations|pg||
nt|diumraid: ****  IN RUNNING LIVE LADY MILNE ****  IRELAND 34, N-IRELAND 33, SCOTLAND 32, CBAI 32, ENGLAND 28, WALES 21 *****|pg||
nt|lestergold: played by west its better than a roland slam lot better|pg||
mb|3D|nt|chick: I would .. a kib asked me if I'd open 2@C and I said never, it distorts the hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well I would hate 1C P P P|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: so would I, but if partner passed 1@C we probably don't have game anywhere|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well done|pg||
nt|paulg: i don't see drury on their card so I'm a little surprised she did not respond 2@d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now 4@D to agree diamonds|pg||
mb|3N|nt|odysseus69: thx Diarmuid|pg||
nt|aupillon: I prefer 1@d : the worst minor suit ( Hog partenering Hog) :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: i do too, as long as it does not guarantee 4 clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnc: North must be surprised seeing partner Blackwooding|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can't see that helping here - not good news for East|pg||
nt|capercliff: @h lead coming|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this could depend upon the lead...|pg||
nt|aupillon: @h for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: and cant go wrong|pg||
nt|aupillon: and so what ? as one says. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: although even on a heart lead, West will probably switch to diamonds  |pg||
nt|capercliff: too late I think Mike?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no......|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: don't agree with 3NT|pg||
pc|c4|nt|chick: A bit risky BW, as S can't know about the @SK|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well that saves a trick|pg||
nt|paulg: suppressing 5-card support is rarely a good idea, but I think it is a difficult slam to bid confidently|pg||
nt|lestergold: its dreadful- spade lead and play werong diamond honour and 3n offski!|pg||
nt|paulg: certainly 4@d looked a better option|pg||
pc|cA|nt|odysseus69: playing South for 4 card heart suit - cant say I fancy that|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bobholl: kib and i wondering why E asked :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: at least play the hand in a sensible game like 5d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, but at the score you should at least make an effort, even if you stop in 5@D |pg||
pc|c5|nt|capercliff: now its easy|pg||
nt|chessmaste: On a diamond lead declarer simply knocks out the ace of spades|pg||
nt|aupillon: i think the reason not playing @d is that 1NT often hides a diamond suit|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|nt|aupillon: @s|pg||
nt|paulg: actually, I don't like East's first bid ... I would respond 2@d rather than 1@s|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|aupillon: merci|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chessmaste: On a heart lead the diamond switch leaves declarer with four @C, three @H and 1@D - one short|pg||
nt|capercliff: actually you are right Mark, and declarer should maybe rise with the A for that reason|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|lestergold: i think Mike we agree even if we dont agree on counting or spelling|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, you have an easy 2@S over a 2@H rebid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we do agree on counting and spelling - we are just not very good at them|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|chick: we're actually playing this out?|pg||
nt|bobholl: claim :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: yes and Paul the hand was a game forcing hand so should have bid the 5 card diamond suit first i agree|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@H-2@D-3@S would be a good start|pg||
pc|c2|pc|dK|nt|capercliff: if up with A@h is 9|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Draw trump, an embarrassing 11 tricks - but no-one did anything seriously wrong|pg||
nt|lestergold: when u have the sterngth use it to bid out ur distribution !!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|odysseus69: west passed with AKJ of hearts - c ace marked with East|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|lestergold: strength!|pg||
nt|lestergold: inded Mike |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East could almost bid Blackwood after that|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h9|nt|vugrapha3: no mistake...this the play|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg: both have been conservative, without doing anything really wrong, but a good vulnerable game has been missed|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Sometimes both partners are maximum and the hands fit well.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|aupillon: sure that @d was easy, but it always happens like that. W can imagine the J! in E|pg||
nt|lestergold: it would ensure the right denomination even if east decided taht spade ace opposite void was a duplication|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s2|pc|dJ|nt|dan_hohor: ozenir and wein are super tired ( yestaeday they played 64 boards too ) and need to play another 12 !|pg||

nt|james_h: If you open your windows in Dublin, you should hear Terry quite clearly|pg||
nt|sharkirl: as u say same 10 tricks with some fancy footwork in between|pg||
nt|finch: Jon is going to be very cross about this hand afterwards... even though he took a sensible line|pg||
nt|mayors: well I Think the welsh are very lucky to have defeated this|pg||
nt|mowen: so A@D beat the contract|pg||
nt|finch: with the very favourable club lie, 4@H can be made on any lead here|pg||
nt|mowen: if west played low what would he have done?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Cooke looks a bit happier now|pg||
nt|eamongall: panic kind of set in and the defence remained with its best source of tricks in tact at the end |pg||
nt|ppiglett: I'd say|pg||
nt|viren169: Np as 3@S was brought home safely!|pg||
nt|viren169: Nice hand now...|pg||
nt|mowen: for who?:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 21 - 19 and not much here it seems|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I can recommend Kelsey´s book Killing defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: double club finesse acceptable or bang down ace but small to q does not seem the right way to play this|pg||
nt|werge: Another 3 NT E/W|pg||
nt|rnc: agree, indeed|pg||
mb|1S|nt|james_h: Joking of course|pg||
nt|othered1: Well, EW didn't get a chance to be bullied into a bad-scoring red spot.|pg||
nt|mariner1: no slam EW though they could end up in one............|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E must have a full count on N, so????|pg||
nt|sybarra: much better than 4 @H |pg||
mb|p|nt|jferg: east needs to find a club lead against 3nt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this one is tough, can not stayman and show diamonds unless playing 2 way stayman|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@c multi-way|pg||
nt|mayors: 1@s 5+ hearts|pg||
nt|finch: when he won the spade switch in hand, he was clearly planning to take the diamond fineese|pg||
nt|othered1: unlucky @S and @C positions could even beat 4@S, if east goes wrong|pg||
nt|ralfwil: missing two aces (@dA and @sK), so probably no slam|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jcomyn: no u are right I heard him|pg||
nt|viren169: fancy footwork to keep us entertained!|pg||
nt|jallerton: 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@D by E/W|pg||
nt|viren169: they should reach game now!|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS have a rare VUL save in 5@D over 4@S or 5@C... but that might shove NS|pg||
nt|mariner1: higher to a losing spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: think he will after S shows hearts|pg||
nt|jferg: think he will t/fer to dias|pg||
nt|cindy: he shouldnt txf to diamonds|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like 2@H should go two down|pg||
nt|mowen: 2@c precision style, no hesitation from Norman showing longer suit...lucky him|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: n/s can probably make 5c with trhe very favourable heart position|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@S now|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: I like the way Terry discarded the notion of a 4-4 spade fit and proceeded with Diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: good pass by N...keep N/S safe from going minus!|pg||
nt|mowen: is the system designed for confusion or is there constructive reasons|pg||
nt|finch: 2@D is a good heart raise, at least INV; 2@S showed a maximum (possibly a slightly optimistic maximum)|pg||
nt|finch: maximum in the context of not opening a strong club|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good decision to bid here - looks like defense will beat 1N|pg||
nt|ciaran: Must show 4/4 and a max?|pg||
nt|jallerton: What does Stayman mean in Ireland?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: think Carroll said "both M" but not sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: (for 3@c)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes it shows both|pg||
nt|jallerton: In most of the world, 2@d, 2@h and 2@s are the only permitted responses|pg||
nt|ianrei: and now they're too high|pg||
nt|jallerton: In case West has a hand like his actual one and wants to pass any response|pg||
mb|2S|nt|viren169: border line between pass and 1NT in my book|pg||
nt|sharkirl: I would pass |pg||
nt|sharkirl: and be happy to come in later if necessary|pg||
nt|sharkirl: they are playing 4-card Majors|pg||
nt|jcomyn: getting a bit highwith a 6-count|pg||
nt|viren169: wow!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|rnc: which is down in practice on the bad trump break|pg||
nt|lestergold: and lookis likely to be bid now|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: As long as South keeps his fingers off the red one.. :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jferg: i think they play non promisery stayman|pg||
nt|jcomyn: coming|pg||
nt|finch: The system does have theoretical merit|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3@S looks like 9 or 10 as card lie|pg||
nt|mariner1: well a @D would have been a better pointy suit to lead here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Best lead!|pg||
mb|p|nt|VugraphPL1: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/2009/krajowe/gpp/01elblag/emax.html|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well regardless of suit lengths and quality, i think double is pretty dangerous unless you have the specific agreement that if you bid a major over partners 1D advance of your ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double, you show no extra values. i think few pairs have that agreement|pg||
nt|jallerton: May be on unsure gorund here.  How strong is 3@c?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: a practical auction|pg||
nt|fabsayc: east should find club lead, infering hearts in dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: i feel south should bid 5c now|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n has play but very uncomfortable|pg||
nt|finch: you get a lot more room after the 1@H opening (showing 4+ spades) to sort out the shapes|pg||
nt|mowen: sounds fun!!??|pg||
nt|finch: the system includes a 2@C opening with both majors, reducing the problems of finding a fit in the other major|pg||
nt|eamongall: the bridge correspondant of the Sunday Independant indicates Ireland can win the Senior Camrose this year |pg||
nt|viren169: Norman is on the go-faster stripes stuff!|pg||
nt|othered1: with @S splitting, this is only about overtricks (probably making on nose)|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be certainly|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: this is all wrong|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 1H by E 2D by S|pg||
nt|finch: so the 1M openings don't have the other major unless they are max, or 6-4|pg||
nt|finch: Another trump lead, another hand where I wouldn't have led a trump.... this time it makes no different, however|pg||
nt|othered1: Again, east will have to play @S suit right in 5@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: just to hard for NS to come in VUL vs NV|pg||
nt|othered1: if @D lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cindy: is W supposed to throw the J here with Jxxx ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: not an attractive lead vs 3NT as West (if that becomes the final contract)|pg||
nt|ciaran: Trump lead would hold this to 6 or 7 tricks|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg: i'd have been slightly nervous as South until dummy came down|pg||
nt|cindy: i agree and if i double and partner bids diamonds, thats where i have to play|pg||
nt|barbyh: but the danger is you lose your other suit|pg||
nt|cindy: so thats why i dont like double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some of us only have one suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: well that lead has improved the prospects|pg||
nt|mowen: how do they find the time to invent and practise|pg||
nt|viren169: the dble slowed him down...|pg||
nt|lestergold: given the thin-ness of the dim guard|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep|pg||
nt|rnc: tell him!|pg||
nt|werge: West has a clear-cut 2 @H buid|pg||
nt|sybarra: over zealous here|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree hans|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2h shows his values|pg||
nt|werge: 3 @H shows a mountain|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|cindy: and does this mean W does not have the J ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if NS play that stayman followed by a 2NT rebid over 2S does not promise 4 hearts, that might be a tactically better way to bid the S hand, which in any case is aceless. he can ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trust N to go on most of the time when  he should|pg||
nt|jferg: if they play rev att he will conyinue|pg||
nt|cindy: operator tells me the Q asks for attitude|pg||
nt|finch: they play a huge amount online on BBO|pg||
nt|ciaran: This should be beaten - defense have several chances to find the spade ruff|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@d was presumably a retransfer|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Trump lead shouts out - heart shortage known in dummy and looking at heart length|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep |pg||
nt|lestergold: and it isnt|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|james_h: Derek didnt fly all that way to pass|pg||
nt|jcomyn: strange bid by Terry with singleton D - could be very dangerous|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he'd ate you James if u did that|pg||
nt|james_h: He has to make an effort opposite a Vul Overcall and he has a reasonable hand|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Is Mr C offering odds?|pg||
nt|mowen: hmm, B'wood no help here with such length between them...and a stiff in 3 suits:)|pg||
nt|othered1: That 2@S opening did the job.  If pass, south might try a 3rd seat 2@D (if available) and that might set north off when EW compete|pg||
nt|mariner1: even with @c lead and ruff that would have probably forced E to play @SA and one|pg||
nt|mariner1: to make|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h needs ace of dims right and a 3/2 break as well as no ruffs kless than 50%|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|lestergold: well 3n is there for then taking as the cards lie|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cant throw jack, partner might underlead and block suit|pg||
nt|mowen: you would lead a @D?|pg||
nt|finch: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: increased odds on south's opneing bid tho|pg||
nt|rnc: Are there any reasons not playing @H:s on normal lines? I don't think so...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cindy: well i know that|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ciaran: the clublead has given declarer a quick re-entry to hand for a second heart ruff|pg||
pc|s4|nt|werge: No-no - after South´s opening it´s 90 %|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|viren169: some specs think it is dangerous to pass... |pg||
nt|viren169: It is close...|pg||
nt|mayors: I would also lead a @d|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|jallerton: N's peter in trumps may be suit preference|pg||
nt|ciaran: even if Garey guesses trumps, Howard should find the switch knowing declarer has 4@S|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|cindy: my question was related to their methods|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, regardless of their agreements, W should try to play a card in tempo. otherwiuse there might be a problem|pg||
nt|ciaran: shows what i know!  much easier looking at all four hands|pg||
nt|ppiglett: absolutely|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: nice play!|pg||
nt|othered1: That did the job in @S. well done|pg||
pc|h2|nt|finch: I tend to make aggressive leads against this type of power auction.  Makes the defence easier later|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cindy: i said i prefer overcall unless on the rare exception when the 4 card suit is MUCH better than the 5 card suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 9 tricks!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With N´s play he had gone down with @s 2-5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a first duck is obvious|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5@c would also make |pg||
nt|lestergold: about 75 id say|pg||
pc|cK|nt|werge: OK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mowen: I'd have xx and waited to see if pard found something useful...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ciaran: Declarer has done very well to get trumps right|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sharkirl: and vul v non-vul, why stick ur neck out?|pg||
nt|viren169: +80 is likley to create a small swing with only 7 tricks available.|pg||
nt|jallerton: S knows N has 2 spades, but does he know about the ace?|pg||
nt|lestergold: but academical as they say|pg||
nt|sybarra: -1 claim |pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: and east has set up the ninth trick but what could he do|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ianrei: strange anti percentage play in H|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even then i would overcall rather than double. but i would overcall the four-card suit instead of the five:   xxxxx  AKQx  xx Ax|pg||
nt|paulg: a slightly soft defence, but only overtricks|pg||
pc|c2|nt|finch: either the lead works well or you've let the contract through... I think the former happens more often than the latter|pg||
nt|mowen: I am in the minority in avoiding leading from kings against suits|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s7|nt|ciaran: no, but as declarer has four of them, he will score his K regardless, so switching wins when N has the A|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: may not risk the heart finese for the overtrick|pg||
nt|bobh1: endplay avail|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jallerton: but East has to discard|pg||
pc|c5|nt|viren169: specs are swayed by the game bonus when vul... |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jcomyn: The Burke calls cu u all leter|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|viren169: Here Walshe did well|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|nt|jallerton: If N has Jx, that would save dec. a guess|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s8|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|d8|pc|h3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|h9|nt|jallerton: Having said that, I think N's peter in trumps was suit preference, so perhaps S should have got this right|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ciaran: yes - not risk free, but looking at how Garvey guessed in trumps, would he go wrong in @S :)|pg||

nt|dan_hohor: yesterday|pg||

nt|jcomyn: miggly moggly hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: pender and newell are a new p'ship|pg||
nt|toobad: it will be interesting to see how bunty responds on that hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: right result but not AA route|pg||
nt|odysseus69: some excitement here maybe|pg||
nt|aupillon: waiting for 4 @h|pg||
nt|capercliff: weak 2?|pg||
nt|paulg: multi 2@d|pg||
nt|aupillon: if this is weak, yes :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: an opportunity spurned, that|pg||
nt|paulg: may still be a big gain, you have to get the diamonds right in the slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed, but you would want to be there, I think|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bobholl: 1 nt all pass no vulnarable landy |pg||
nt|cuttysark: I would not open that North hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: atc this score u have to be there|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcomyn: tight game|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What was the result on board 2? No score entered|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The lead was @H 3 so declarer knew hearts were probably 4-2 - maybe she hoped East had led low from @H KQx3|pg||
nt|capercliff: but she had the K in her hand|pg||
nt|paulg: a complete misfit, so they need to stop bidding as soon as possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: They probably could have.  I think it's a big overstatement to think that the Ozenir team are at a disadvantage |pg||
nt|toobad: v probable|pg||
nt|aupillon: Good|pg||
mb|2D|nt|paulg: 3@c probably a mixed raise (what ever that means)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 1NT by East -1 as I recollect|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 4-card support, limited values|pg||
nt|odysseus69: do we agree with East pass?|pg||
nt|toobad: how many spades from E??|pg||
nt|paulg: 4@s now|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I'm talking about declarer|pg||
nt|aupillon: they show range of force, here ,|pg||
nt|aupillon: ?)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS better off out of this|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: worth a shot|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operator, please insert   1NE-1  in MOVIE along board 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: hmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: it's probably good for a new partnership to have easy straightforward bidding, but a little boring for us :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: a wise decsion|pg||
nt|paulg: the clues were there and they did well|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not a completely classic take-out double, and hits the worst possible response|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jcomyn: daresay the H bid put her off|pg||
nt|chick: 4 small in the opps suit is not a good holding :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: at least we know better than normal what's going on :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is a stop-gap pairing folks|pg||
nt|paulg: I'm sure Martin knows, but probably doesn't care what it actually shows|pg||
nt|paulg: 2nd in hand I agree with East's pass|pg||
nt|toobad: woops|pg||
nt|capercliff: even if playing the A at trick 1 was almost 100%|pg||
nt|lestergold: well poor old wales they relly are dropping into the mire when they dont need to|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cuttysark: After the light opener she may well drop @SK|pg||
nt|paulg: yes, especially if the @dQ is led|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnc: Could be hard to manage, with dummy likely overruffed|pg||
nt|jcomyn: looks a good decision to stay out of game|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4NT???|pg||
nt|paulg: this should be invitational|pg||
nt|capercliff: well 3@c shows a good 2@h hand?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|rnc: At least there will be less problems in this contract than in the higher one|pg||
nt|aupillon: i don't know what you thing but i love PASS|pg||
nt|paulg: if partner does not have an invite, then why not 2@h initially|pg||
nt|aupillon: it depends of the OTHER possibilities they play on 2@d i suppose|pg||
nt|paulg: very strong 1-suiter minor and 23-24 balanced|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but I am afraid that this is a violation of Burn's First law|pg||
nt|lestergold: no great sin committed here|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|cuttysark: Nope - always lead partner's 'suit'|pg||
nt|rednaxela: I've never quite got to grips with the mixed raise.  Seems to leave partner guessing as to where your values are while reducing the space in which to find out.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Fatigue is a factor you can't rule out, though|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In two days of bridge?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: I have to be with Roland on this one, sorry Bill|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk5: Yes, 128 boards in two days take its toll|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Brad looks SUPER TIRED|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: all right|pg||
nt|bjacobs: wake him up for me|pg||
nt|lethal666: lol, after 2 days at the open playoff against australia's best teams, we managed at least 1 and a half more days before fatigue hit|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i asked him: ARE YOU TIRED? he said NO|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: if you are a 4 day team playing 64 boards twice  becomes chalanging|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well done, Anne!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|paulg: drops the spade because of the danger of the ruff|pg||
nt|odysseus69: agree with sound second hand preempts except at favourable when some weakies can be lobbed in|pg||
nt|paulg: you prefer 3@S?|pg||

pc|s7|nt|capercliff: after finding out that partner has a good first seat Vul weak 2 bid, game should be bid|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bobholl: good guess !|pg||
pc|d5|nt|chessmaste: 2NT was fine - give North @H KQxxxx and out and 3NT is not so bad |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rednaxela: Well done.|pg||
nt|toobad: either way, good play|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It has pre-emptive advantages - I like it. What other use do you have for the bid?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d2|nt|odysseus69: some days and definitely when behind|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|paulg: minisplinter|pg||
nt|rednaxela: minisplinter|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Showing similar values with a short club? How often do you have that?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|aupillon: a bit too many. The problem with that is that i don't know if you can describe weak or strong in weak majors|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|dan_hohor:  4 man team|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Aces are powerful in this situation|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes best to have trump majority but east needed to show his opener with 4 good hearts and west had a 2d bid and eatst had a one bid competier|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Burn's First Law: When you are declaring a trump contract, it is a good idea to have more trumps than the opponents.   |pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: what can he say |pg||
nt|jcomyn: Newell and Kelly played together in the trials. Pender played with Coyne and with her sister Noreen on the team last year. All sorts of shennanigans went on over this team for the ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: last week or so, so lets not mince words|pg||
nt|paulg: a scary double but it will earn an extra 50|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but in truth, East was a bit unlucky.|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course sometime u get punished for what ou were dealt |pg||
nt|lestergold: they shouldnt be castigated here|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h2|nt|aupillon: cool|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes you can, but maybe 3@c was the weaker of options|pg||
nt|mdgraham: That word competier, Mike - is it French?|pg||
nt|lestergold: ki meant competer|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|capercliff: maybe|pg||

nt|sharkirl: agreed|pg||
nt|ianrei: hi all|pg||
nt|ciaran: Ireland gained 12 imps on the board where the defense can promote the trump J in both 2S and 3H |pg||
nt|ppiglett: Excellent H game E-W|pg||
nt|viren169: a possible swing there!|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S NS seems straight forward here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: interesting hand here many possibilities|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6c has play by n/s|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed but e/w will be active here i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: bound to barrage in spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: so no coffee brek now for the commentators|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: some number of spades by e/w would be my guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: Welcome to Ian Reissmann,|pg||
nt|mowen: well the other room may find it tough too..|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we wil see e/w zoom in to 4 @S |pg||
nt|lestergold: can north south communicate their values and fit now?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jferg: could get overbord in 3nt |pg||
nt|sharkirl: perhaps ur right - 1NT bid in other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Ian|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@c game forcing I think|pg||
nt|mowen: 3nt by Garvey|pg||
nt|finch: NS have a 500 save against 4@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4 @s games on 6 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: on board 1 in Open they bid and made 7@H|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jcomyn: think 5D is now out|pg||
nt|ciaran: First outing in the Camrose for Derek O'Gorman and Terry Walsh this weekend|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5c infrangible |pg||
nt|jallerton: E limited by his failure to open a strong @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 4@S by E/W will be hard to reach...|pg||
nt|lestergold: so is 3n of course but a silly looking contract|pg||
nt|mayors: marginal save but north is flat with QTx @s so they probably wont find|pg||
nt|finch: Agreed it's marginal.  It's worth bidding 5@C on this type of hand because sometimes they bid 5@S and go off|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2NT may be a good club raise |pg||
nt|ciaran: There was a bigger score than 4H on offer there!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Cooke & O'Gorman checking the clock|pg||
nt|viren169: England are well behind in the match... maybe that is why we are seeing some interesting bidding going on?!?!?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s not exactly a zoom|pg||
mb|3D|nt|paulg: lots of values in this hand, but no big fit |pg||
nt|cindy: what with N now ?|pg||
nt|paulg: 2@s or 3@c|pg||
nt|jferg: although lavery show know after the rebid partner has 11 13|pg||
nt|jferg: too late now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2nt gets my ugly award of the day|pg||
nt|cindy: needed AKQJ of hearts i guess|pg||
nt|cindy: might get heart lead now i guess|pg||
nt|cindy: but shouldnt stop W from play @ss when he gets in|pg||
nt|jferg: still time for a spade switch from sime|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well thats brave|pg||
nt|james_h: My My Derek is getting giggy with it ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this will be some effort if they get there|pg||
nt|ciaran: well, hard to see more than one quick loser in @D, though 12 tricks not be possible|pg||
nt|james_h: Terry with drive it home now|pg||
nt|mowen: 4@S is off if clubs are 2-2|pg||
nt|finch: The double of 4@C must be very pure take-out, he's not going to be happy if partner passes|pg||
nt|rnc: On the spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this has fal;len flat|pg||
nt|roswolf: no but this looks very safe|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: presuming both are forcing|pg||
nt|viren169: Now if East has a way of playing in 3@S... Will he take it?|pg||
nt|finch: not if spades are 2-2 as well|pg||
mb|3H|nt|finch: 2-2, 2 if you like|pg||
nt|mowen: true|pg||
nt|bobh1: the 4@s game that was supposed to go down actually was bid and made in the other room|pg||
nt|bobh1: here is a 3n game that is supposed to go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: that spade suit is pretty good|pg||
nt|cindy: now he hasnt shown his good spades or his club fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if the reverse is not GF, it should certainly promise another call, so i think N ought to be bidding a black suit over 2H|pg||
nt|cindy: what is this auction ?|pg||
nt|sharkirl: on the last board in the other room they are now in 4@H v the 1@S here|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: wasn't alerted though|pg||
nt|mcarroll: delicate trump suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s can make 4h probably 5cl in comfort and they arev defending 2s|pg||
mb|3N|nt|paulg: their convention card is pretty convention-free, so may be 3@c is non-forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the 3D call really put N in the soup|pg||
nt|paulg: now forced to bid 4@c, i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if that is so, then N can bid 2S, which is surely forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: what kind of bidding is this?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What is 2NT?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: primitive?|pg||
nt|cindy: thats what i was wondering|pg||
nt|jferg: normal i guess|pg||
nt|cindy: 2N and 5C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2NT is normal?|pg||
nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|jferg: souths diamond maybe as few as one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so ugly and bizarre on same hand|pg||
nt|cindy: even more reason to bid hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes, and what would 1@H show as response to 1@D?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Derek is beginning to sweat I can see it on his furrowed brow|pg||
nt|ianrei: what was the X of 2NT ?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Tonking wasn't that productive the last time!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: 80 min or so left|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@D shows 6-4?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@C then 1N is 19+ here|pg||
nt|bobh1: the defense with E on lead is not obvious; with W on lead np|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With 5M opening you often will play on 5-3 and not find your 4-4 and as here 5-3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that´s one of the reasons that I don´t like 5-card major o+pening|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: play 3C nonforcing doesnt seem like a good use of methods|pg||
nt|lestergold: iif the defence cashed 4h and a club then this would be shown up as a silly contract but here it rolls in due to the heart blockage|pg||
nt|mayors: I think north has too much stuff to expect a 5 level adventure from EW, especially on this semi scrambling auction|pg||
nt|mowen: S&D have coped well|pg||
nt|finch: I agree.  South had a pretty solid weak jump compared to what he could have had (e.g. 1336 opposite is 800)|pg||
nt|petepunt: too many values in @D is appears|pg||
nt|henryb: only three top losers (well 4 because can't set up a @c) but I expect two down|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Townsend giving a lot of thought to his lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianrei: 3NT is ok, to go off you need the C finesse to lose and they cash 4H|pg||
nt|ianrei: the right line in 5C isn't clear|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but 5c is a better contract and bears more resmblance to bridge as well|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, they can't cash _five_ hearts straight away v 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i do not regard 5hearts to the j opposite a void as a v ery adequate stopper |pg||
nt|jallerton: doubling a natural 2NT seems a bit risky on E with no club trick|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good position for EBU here as 3H makes|pg||
nt|ianrei: 2NT had 8 on top|pg||
nt|ianrei: even 3NT might make|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: mebbe N meant good raise and alerted as such?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: he's the other side of screen|pg||
nt|jallerton: I think Andy likes to play 2NT as natural where possible - but here there is no other call available below 3@c to show a good raise|pg||
nt|ianrei: I expect N/S play 2NT as a raise - John usually does|pg||
nt|ciaran: Slightly surprising result on board 3 in the other room if correct.|pg||
nt|ianrei: andy took some time to bid 2NT (assuming we saw the actual tempo)|pg||
nt|ianrei: if it was a raise would have been obvious|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: took time waiting for tray to come back after 2H so both 2NT and X may have taken time|pg||
nt|henryb: I tould lead a trump with those @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: that was the danger of bidding 1NT vul|pg||
nt|sharkirl: well bid on  this|pg||
nt|finch: Yes, once the double of 4@C wasn't passed, East could show spades and diamonds, choice of games|pg||
nt|ciaran: Not obvious to double with no trump trick in either hand|pg||
nt|petepunt: prob same effect as e can;t continue @H|pg||
nt|othered1: Has SA Texas (minors transferring to majors) become standard, rather than suit under?  I play that, but it seems uncommon in USA.  See it much more frequently online.|pg||
nt|mariner1: well with 4@C and 4@H in W the defense should be able to hold 3N to set|pg||
nt|rnc: Personally I would have reopened with a D on South|pg||
nt|lestergold: which is frigid |pg||
pc|d8|nt|jcomyn: Yowza|pg||
nt|sharkirl: and a pressure lead|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer wont be too happy at the start but will come out well as the hand is played out...|pg||
nt|viren169: great lead...|pg||
nt|viren169: prefer a simple 3@H|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|finch: If you want to see more of Cooke & Garvey in action, they frequently play late night teams matches|pg||
nt|mowen: 5@D seems a little cowardly|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|finch: look for mugsmate and TheGarve|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this comes home it will surely rattle the opps|pg||
nt|othered1: Many (most?) systems place high priority on setting trumps, and secondary fits can be tough to find, since often new suits after agreement are slam tries and may not show length.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|viren169: another slam missed!|pg||
nt|mowen: so down in a game when 6NT is decent|pg||
pc|s3|nt|paulg: it looks like you have to play the club suit for one loser whereever you end up|pg||
nt|mariner1: board 3, the 4@S DBL making ended in 5@H DBL East in Open|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: i think this is the BMUS system|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 2 a IMPs loss when they let NS play 2@d|pg||
pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: the real problem is that despite the array of HCP, N does not have such a fasbulously fitting hand that he should be eager to wait until the 4 level to show his fit.|pg||
nt|barbyh: no problem here|pg||
nt|paulg: well there is the trump suit to play|pg||
nt|barbyh: no problem|pg||
nt|cindy: no problem but not a good contract either|pg||
nt|barbyh: d is on and clubs are favorable|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pretty grotty slam. is it that clear to find the winning play in trumps?|pg||
nt|barbyh: how else wd you play it?|pg||
nt|cindy: how can he go wrong ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well he has a very good idea where everything is|pg||
nt|ciaran: Even with the friendly break in clubs and diamonds, might need a heart guess here?|pg||
nt|viren169: another swing...|pg||
nt|mowen: denning never got to show his good values|pg||
pc|h8|nt|marlowepi: clubs are not so favorable if you start with a small opne from hand|pg||
nt|cindy: could even lead Q from dummy|pg||
nt|barbyh: if the kings not on side j10 fropping is great|pg||
nt|paulg: you don't have many entries to dummy|pg||
nt|paulg: so club to the @cQ and @ck, then finesse on the return to pick up 4-1 clubs |pg||
nt|ppiglett: And with 6 good spades and heart sup|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cindy: beavis ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: what about a reopening double  ?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: well it worked sort of|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "Beam Me Up, Scotty"|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can still beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @CA and another|pg||
nt|cindy: iwould be afraid i would never be able to get another partner if i bid that way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you might have to emigrate then cindy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you can;t bowl that slow in this crowd, cindy|pg||
nt|cindy: to ireland ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sime should be able to solve this defense|pg||
nt|jferg: more than welcome wonderful country|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well done Derek|pg||
nt|ciaran: Very well done|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: perfect shape partner is marked with values|pg||
pc|d5|nt|henryb: ten tricks now|pg||
nt|petepunt: whoops a googly in cricket terms|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: home free now|pg||
nt|jallerton: I've known worse "stoppers"|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sharkirl: still under pressure|pg||
nt|jallerton: often most of the time on the other side of the screen is taken up with explanations!|pg||
nt|othered1: And indeed west here made good decision to go for 590 on board 3.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|henryb: one of the points of a trump lead is that it suggests control of dummy's second suit. |pg||
nt|henryb: So partner will be less tempted to duck the @s|pg||
nt|petepunt: very true,  he did give it a lot of thought too.|pg||
nt|bobh1: actually the defense to 3n is trivial; E just holds up in @d and S has no chance at all|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: so board 3 was 11 imps to OS.se allowing the 4@S DBL|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as we were agreed here in CR, that pass was the best|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sharkirl: needs @S finesse|pg||
nt|henryb: the other point is to cut down on ruffs!|pg||
nt|petepunt: also no @H overcall by S so likely only 4 yet he jumped to 4@H|pg||
nt|petepunt: wont hold aQ@S surely ?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: well, it is easy enough to see that the club suit comes in when we see all the cards. if not i think there is a fair case for starting with a small one|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you start small, then PRC is going to say finesse next time|pg||
nt|ciaran: Doesn' look to be any losing option, but he has a choice whether to pay for @H or @C to break|pg||
nt|ciaran: Can he combine chances?|pg||
nt|viren169: Specs are asking for their money back... can only get better!|pg||
pc|s6|nt|henryb: if he ruffs high, down he will go|pg||
nt|mowen: perhaps he should have raised the 4th suit to show a max of this type of shape|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|viren169: not anymore...|pg||
nt|viren169: all routes led to success...|pg||
nt|viren169: not clear where playing the A or small is best at trick 1|pg||
nt|othered1: I agreed that pass was best on hand, but not sure I would have found it myself.|pg||
nt|rnc: Agree - not that it carries to 5@C, but at least it'll give NS a plus score|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jferg: maybe emigrate to scotland:  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: can;t blame E for heart lead. need to lead best suit on such auctions & from his hand it seems hearts is most likely weak spot when they eschew 3NT. of course, in a sequence like ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this, who knows?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|paulg: i guess there is a slight chance of a diamond ruff in the air|pg||
nt|paulg: but 4-1 clubs more likely than 6-1 diamonds|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he is  not taking any risk|pg||
nt|henryb: now claim on a high crossruff|pg||
pc|sT|nt|petepunt: Dafydd (son of Gary) Jones|pg||
nt|henryb: and here I was hoping son of Tom|pg||
nt|henryb: :)|pg||
nt|werge: We must be close to a claim|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|sharkirl: percentage to play Q as they are playing 3rd and 5th leads|pg||
nt|jallerton: I've just found it their system file: 2NT was a good raise!|pg||
nt|lestergold: there is room for a turn around |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk4: Oh dear|pg||
nt|cindy: what is going on here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Comedy of errors|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and claim|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: sure jefff|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|VugraphPL1: 50%|pg||
nt|viren169: Declare still worried about clubs...|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|h6|nt|jferg: another shakesperian play|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|nt|marlowepi: same one actually|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why that when C are all in|pg||
pc|c9|nt|fabsayc: merchant of venus|pg||
nt|lestergold: how many boards left?|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jferg: not sure who got the pound of flesh|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the quality of defense was strained|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jferg: or was it midsummers night dream?|pg||
nt|cindy: lets hope for better on the next hand|pg||
nt|jferg: next might be much ado about nothing|pg||

nt|dan_hohor: from my experience , when you reach the last set of the 64 boards ( in the 2nd day ) you just play instinctively as it becomes too hard to count and put some logic together|pg||
nt|bobholl: they got a @H trick so nothing missed :)|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Not very often but it is very descriptive.  You can bid 2S on hands like this and have more room to explore.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, Alex, NI did open the east hand on board 2 - you need to know the field :)|pg||
nt|toobad: board 17 yielded 10 imps to NI since 4s one off in the open room|pg||
nt|diumraid: ****  LIVE  IN RUNNING from LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  N-IRELAND 52, IRELAND 50, CBAI 48, SCOTLAND 43, ENGLAND 42, WALES 35  *****|pg||
nt|aupillon: it'll be hard|pg||
nt|paulg: very early days in all the matches|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I like that terminology - a "competier" - a hand on which you would like to make one bid|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|dan_hohor: 2D will do|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The women should be able to avoid the 4-level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, still close|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW could reach 3NT here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk5: Did they take all double cards away from West in the other room?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: very funny|pg||
nt|capercliff: would be interesting to get an interpretation of the auction, but they were on the same page|pg||
nt|aupillon: another tricky hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: points + @S LT 15 :)|pg||
nt|paulg: yes, looks like a normal place to end|pg||
nt|lestergold: another not too great hand for e/w 3n likely to be bid 15 opp 10 but hands fit badly and cards lie unkindly except in spades|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lethal666: i was thinking that exact point|pg||
nt|paulg: double by West?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: probably|pg||
nt|lestergold: trick maybe givn on lead |pg||
nt|mdgraham: operator, could you tell us if they are using screens, please?|pg||
nt|paulg: they do use screens|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lethal666: 3nt just doesnt seem to have the tricks. one down is probable|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: lets see...|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: I can see only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That might be an effective lead ... a club lead would be a real problem|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: stranger things have happened|pg||
nt|Walddk5: @HQ is an excellent choice of leads|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One thing is for sure.  Brad Wein will need to be wide awake here to make the contract|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Serious restraint by South - I think I would want to bid that suit in case West bid 3NT|pg||
nt|paulg: not a classic 1NT and a bit good to my liking, but they'll get to 3NT anyhow|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i expect to read about board 17 in many reports|pg||
nt|capercliff: think I would rather 1N with the W hand|pg||
nt|paulg: it depends what system they are playing|pg||
nt|capercliff: but its borderline|pg||
nt|aupillon: with AAK ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ty|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulg: i'd want to bid that suit whatever West might bid|pg||
nt|cuttysark: She has missed a thin game|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Yes, I'd be in with 3@d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C=checkback one assumes|pg||
nt|lestergold: but look at the communications- there are theoreiclly 4 spade tricks avilable but you have to get to dummy finesse establish and reurn and cash the 4th spade!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: you may need a helicopter or a harrier jump jet for that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, that double may lead to the @CQ lead, and then East has two club tricks|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bjacobs: There are a zillion endplays possible|pg||
nt|toobad: ditto|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: he looks confident... :)|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: spade switch best|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I wouldn't even know how to play the hand with all cards in view|pg||
nt|Walddk5: It's very complicated|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: it is , but it is also very complicated for the defence|pg||
nt|paulg: 1NT shows 12-16|pg||
mb|3N|nt|odysseus69: the oprning 1NT is going to be rearded with d lead|pg||
nt|paulg: from what i'm told, these reports should focus on the excellent play here rather than the ping-pong affair in the other rooom|pg||
nt|odysseus69: rewarded|pg||
mb|p|nt|aupillon: a trick short i suppose|pg||
nt|paulg: if they are playing Acol and weak notrump then 1NT is not an option|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East might raise this to 3NT|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rnc: Looks like nine tricks, with all main suits breaking to declarer's advantage|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no double by North- cannot tell how many red suit tricks will run |pg||
mb|p|nt|dan_hohor: S is in danger to be thrown in to give the 9th trick in @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: looks like any lead will be helpful|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: oh my giddy aunt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but double strikes gold in another way |pg||
nt|mdgraham: South is feeling MUCH happier now|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it only hundreds|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|toobad: 800s do that sometimes to some|pg||
nt|lestergold: instead of 800s or 1100s|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dan_hohor: that if waine plays dimond to the 10|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Only 3 figures - not a big deal!|pg||
nt|paulg: slight signalling problem there but only the second undertrick gone|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|diumraid: Comparison Scores are being loaded - Current state after 5 boards compared is 19 imps each !!!   so its currently a draw|pg||
nt|rnc: However, on double dummy basis NS could have managed an uppercut for a 5th trick|pg||
nt|rnc: But not likely to be found i practise|pg||
nt|rnc: in|pg||
nt|odysseus69: except possibly c9|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|capercliff: the J@s is suit prefernce for @d me thinks|pg||
nt|lestergold: this 4h bid is totally incomprehensible|pg||
nt|paulg: i think it really shows a lack of detailed methods, especially after the double|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: but W should have 5 spades or 3 hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: with north doubling the club bid i do not understand why south imagines that e/w have ot somewhere to run|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|dan_hohor: now it is pressure, do you play D to the 10 ? I wonder why did Alexander throw her settind trick in spades  :) ?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h3|nt|odysseus69: looked right to start on spades|pg||
pc|h7|nt|dan_hohor: he has some nerve :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he will make it|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rednaxela: Less likely to be taken for a big number at these colours.  No-one will have a trump stack and they ar more likely to take their vulnerable game bonus.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: presumably East was afraid her partner had something like 10xx of clubs and that NS would run the suit   |pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|cuttysark: South cannot have @SA as well as the diamonds|pg||
pc|d5|nt|chessmaste: North is hoping her partner can look after the diamonds|pg||

pc|h4|pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: yes - so should have 3 hearts - else why use checkback ?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk5: Neat, well done|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Imagine how well he would play if he wasn't so tired|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: yes..he is happy...and I told you ...he looked confident|pg||

nt|odysseus69: needs that heart back|pg||

nt|capercliff: K@d or J@c?|pg||
mc|7|nt|aupillon: ok|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West might have been checking whether East was maximum or minimum, if 1NT was wide-range  |pg||
nt|paulg: that will not guarantee a fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: yes - by bidding 2NT|pg||

nt|cindy: ok marshall  i agree if you start with low club to dummy  then should hook on way back|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too|pg||
nt|cindy: theyve been opening 1N on this hand|pg||
nt|viren169: still had to rely on clubs at the end...|pg||
nt|viren169: best to duck at trick one I think|pg||
nt|finch: Playing less serious bridge, Cooke would usually open the South hand|pg||
nt|viren169: What about 3@H?|pg||
nt|mowen: still if 5@D is the worst contract they reach they will do well|pg||
nt|werge: No part-score here|pg||
nt|werge: I West opens..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another reason is that a major fit can disappear when opps interfear|pg||
nt|werge: If West.|pg||
nt|lestergold: it could easily be turned round then|pg||
nt|werge: Here 4 @H work better than 4 @S, because of the @d-discards|pg||
nt|lestergold: another interesting one a 20/2o hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: another partscore|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: and they apparently do not play texas after 2H|pg||
nt|sharkirl: yes|pg||
nt|mowen: really?|pg||
nt|finch: Interesting to see how conservative he is playing in the Camrose!|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Good competitive hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: yet another 4@S here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|marlowepi: the question is what is the percxentage way to start the suit|pg||
nt|paulg: i would definitely double with the north hand|pg||
nt|cindy: dont know   havent had enough mountain dew to figure that out yet|pg||
nt|jferg: you can log onto bgb for system sheets|pg||

nt|viren169: nice competitive hand here|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT = 14+- to 17|pg||
nt|finch: if West hadn't opened, NS might have ben in danger of getting too high|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@c = natural or 11-14 balanced|pg||
nt|jallerton: Not a good advertisement for this method|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: yuck!|pg||
nt|ianrei: at least he  has a 3rd C |pg||
nt|ciaran: Might keep E quiet?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like 1N will make N/S and 2M E/W|pg||
nt|ciaran: 5H for E/W and looks like 4S will go one down|pg||
nt|ciaran: Gooke/Garvey's system is here: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/systems/cooke-garvey.pdf|pg||
nt|othered1: And a 5@C save that's OK, even with the trump stack|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW might reach 5@C|pg||
nt|othered1: Bidding a grand here, on @H break, isn't a bad decision.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mcarroll: the trump break dooms 7@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 12 tricks with @h 4-1|pg||

nt|viren169: 5@D for N/S|pg||
nt|finch: I doubt they'll look for a slam now|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT loses 4@s 1@H 2@c|pg||
nt|ppiglett: 2 down with perfect def - diamond ruffs and underleading H|pg||
nt|roswolf: not really i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: you only have one bid opposite a passed hand, so get both majors into play (is my philosophy)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, i would probably overcall, but it is a better double trhan the other hand because you have club tolerance|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a 2C part score - take a short break|pg||
nt|viren169: off on a heart ruff|pg||
nt|mowen: hope south bids now|pg||
nt|jallerton: on the normal @slead|pg||
nt|ciaran: normal if W on lead, yes|pg||
nt|viren169: 3NT E/W way here...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But E told about a rather balanced hand, so pass is not so far away|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cindy: they are bidding and cant stop|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They bid as if they had something|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually you can use texas and 4@S to distinguish shapes or strengths|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why should they go minus when we can?|pg||
nt|ciaran: England gained 6 by staing in partscore on board 3 where Ireland tried 5@D|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@H could get a bit messy|pg||
nt|mayors: oops|pg||
nt|mowen: oh|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@s = no major|pg||
nt|jallerton: Actually, 1@c could also have been any game force, so 1@s doesn't guarantee any values!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But I think the percentage bid is 7|pg||
nt|werge: Oh-no - sleeping|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: my partner's don't expect the unbid minor from me, just majors|pg||
nt|cindy: yeh but what happens is you double and partner bids clubs and then you are stuck|pg||
nt|jallerton: This needs some care|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a dull and infrangible 3n|pg||
nt|ianrei: play on D or C?|pg||
nt|jallerton: best to duck the first trick|pg||
nt|jallerton: then play @c|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ianrei: if you set up 4D tricks you still only have 7 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4 heart tricks 2 spades 2 dims and a long dim and a club ruff??|pg||
nt|rnc: this match can be very close in the end, if Lirarna manage to play solid|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard tio time it tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: whats even worse is when your partner bids clubs and they double|pg||
nt|jallerton: as can then finesse @d into the safe hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry maybe not infrangible|pg||
nt|henryb: not me. I pass a 15-17 1NT with East|pg||
nt|othered1: I would have acted with south's hand over 1@D (2@D)|pg||
nt|othered1: with bad @H break, only chance for 7 NT is to find the opponent with long @H also to have 5!+D and a red suit squeeze.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 35 high and only 12|pg||
nt|werge: Only advantage in 7 NT is, that 4 @H together wit 5 @D is enough|pg||
nt|lestergold: no probs in 3h|pg||
nt|roswolf: east was very restrained - seems to like heavy overcalls|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: and they don't want to be in 5 |pg||
nt|sharkirl: opening 4@S would have worked better on this hand|pg||
nt|mowen: in the books it says make a simple overcall as it won't be passed out - wrong|pg||
nt|mowen: i think Jon should respond to a 2 level overcall|pg||
nt|mayors: I'm going to have to leave you now.  Enjoy the rest of the show.|pg||
nt|mowen: bye|pg||
nt|finch: Thanks very much Graham|pg||
nt|jallerton: interesting|pg||
nt|ciaran: all systems are available here:|pg||
nt|ciaran: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|ciaran: Yes indeed Peter|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but 5D was possible|pg||
nt|viren169: Now 4@S dbled minus 1|pg||
pc|s7|nt|paulg: seem to be a little short of tricks here|pg||
nt|eamongall: 5@Hs has taken a turn for the better|pg||
nt|roswolf: timing is vital here|pg||
nt|lestergold: lose  atrick in each suit in thisn contracty seems easiest line|pg||
nt|roswolf: diamond up - ducked?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: well, i am not that worried about them doubling 2C, or of being set much if they do|pg||
nt|paulg: although every action looks reasonable|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and if it is a partscore hand there is not a lot at stake either|pg||
nt|paulg: that is, reasonable in the context of everyone overbidding in the modern game|pg||
nt|cindy: it certainly could be if you are doubled vul going down when you can make hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a widespread philosophy aparently|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we have moved to neputian bidding now, way out|pg||
nt|cindy: have these people had dinner yet ?|pg||
nt|viren169: seems the par result...|pg||
nt|petepunt: neither can sing :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Can anyone decode this?|pg||
nt|werge: So 7 NT should be around 70 %|pg||
pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: would make if played by S on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|mayors: I would try 2NT with the south cards|pg||
nt|ciaran: East displays the magic dummy|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Goo d new for dec at trick one|pg||
nt|chick: as do I ... balanced 8 usually isn't enough|pg||
nt|viren169: Cards well placed for declarer... especially on a @H lead!|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good lead from Erichsen. |pg||
nt|mowen: hard to see a swing on this|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|othered1: Thanks, Staffan|pg||
nt|lestergold: if dim ducked then time to ruff one club|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzkp: table amused by dummy's singleton|pg||
nt|henryb: and a balanced 8 opposite 15 often goes down in 2N|pg||
nt|chick: he does have a play for this, endplaying N|pg||
nt|petepunt: agree with pass,  especially as opps may come back in vuln|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: ponder..ponder|pg||
nt|petepunt: small @D |pg||
nt|petepunt: what else can he play|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcomyn: wont 2H make here for EW|pg||
nt|ciaran: Even 3H looks possible with a good guess in H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: seems England in game only on the slam hand|pg||
nt|mayors: @C K is big card|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: half-time announcement made|pg||
nt|viren169: I agree..|pg||
nt|werge: 1 @H was natural...|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@c in probably a minimum and after that cuebids|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|viren169: Declarer will come to 9 tricks one way or another...|pg||
nt|mariner1: another quick hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: Well L is gaining by early aggression which while soundness might be an issue is|pg||
nt|mariner1: paying off|pg||
nt|roswolf: good girl|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence will get 2 clubs a spade and  heart instead|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: if he plays club now then should make as east is hoist between two stools either set up hearts butc west never gets in or plays spade and sets up ninth trick for declarer|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jcomyn: cant see Carvey allowing 2C to go free|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting 2@S bid by South|pg||
nt|lestergold: now can safely finesse dim to east|pg||
nt|mayors: bye all|pg||
nt|mowen: Jon will be surprised when 11 tricks are claimed|pg||
nt|petepunt: the end play looms now|pg||
nt|henryb: Ace and a @d|pg||
nt|petepunt: but may simply play S for q@H|pg||
nt|petepunt: gr8 hand |pg||
nt|henryb: he has 2@d, 3@c and 2@s|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|finch: Their convention card says taht 2NT would have been hearts and clubs, so I'm a bit surprised he didn't do that|pg||
nt|eamongall: or was it always making |pg||
nt|othered1: is east always making 4@S, with, say, @H lead?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm some potential danger here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5@d acking for @hQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: asking|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|cindy: this match was close and then  ....|pg||
nt|ciaran: Since N/S play 4th best leads and N denied a major, declarer knows a lot about the layout|pg||
nt|ianrei: should make 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|mariner1: of course when you are a 100 points off you have to take some chances|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh not best|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: amazing that so far in thios set of deals the score is 1-to-1|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed not|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant be correctr|pg||
nt|rnc: what happened here?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|viren169: Need a flat board to calm the nerves!|pg||
nt|roswolf: ouch|pg||
nt|werge: Good bidding - bad break|pg||
nt|othered1: Intellingently and unluckily bid.  But 7N is better|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - 2 %|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Indeed|pg||
nt|werge: OK - 2½|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ciaran: The @DQ at trick one was revealing too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only with a 5-2 split in @d as additional|pg||
nt|werge: Strange lead against a grand slam - why not ! S8|pg||
nt|werge: @s 8|pg||
pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: true enough, but 1H could lose spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 40 imps could have changed hands|pg||
nt|cindy: marshall quit reading my mind|pg||
nt|mariner1: the Open is catching up with us|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jcomyn: mm 23-6 good start for holders|pg||
nt|viren169: any ideas what that showed?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ciaran: I think declarer needs to take teh ruffing finesse in spades to make|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|paulg: Murdoch goes for the only chance by rising with the @cQ, but it will probably cost another undertrick|pg||
nt|sharkirl: quality of @H suit probably stopped a 4@H response|pg||
nt|lestergold: the lady allowed trumps to be drawn when she could afford to lose a trump trick|pg||
pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: not to worry, shortcircuit after 12 seconds|pg||
nt|petepunt: brd 5 was very int in O-room|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: I assure you all, there is a lot of thought going into this|pg||
nt|henryb: Wales' hope in the other match of interest is fading as EBU is ahead 20-4|pg||
nt|viren169: Some of the specs have said last two hands! Maybe they will change their minds!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|ciaran: surprising that W covered|pg||
nt|jcomyn: home now|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3rd is the realistic target for Wales THIS year|pg||
nt|chick: N's turn to think|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: exactly|pg||
nt|henryb: should have been thinking while Townsend thought.|pg||
nt|henryb: and be ready to play now|pg||
nt|henryb: a @d was surely not inexpected|pg||
nt|henryb: *un...*|pg||
nt|petepunt: if west reads well he always makes ?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|h2|nt|paulg: sound defence from the NI pair|pg||
nt|roswolf: bad news|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jcomyn: well done again|pg||
nt|ciaran: Yes - another good result for N/S|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|werge: If Wests hand is an opening bid, we get no swing here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|werge: Good news - undoubled|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Does anyone pass west's hand any more?|pg||
nt|werge: NO|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|lestergold: wel eas wont allow the overtrick!|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|roswolf: -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: a simple card play error- only right when kh (very unlikely) with west and spades break 4/1 remmeber west already showed up woth kC|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|viren169: Board 17 was flay...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ianrei: accurate play by john|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|viren169: ..flat...|pg||
pc|d4|pc|sT|nt|henryb: what is South thinking about?|pg||
nt|lestergold: more imps maybe to the underdogs|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|nt|viren169: and Open room 3@S was reached on 18|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ciaran: on the board where Garvey played very well to make 3@H, Allfrey and Robson reached 4 which went two down|pg||
nt|jallerton: very pushy on a 4441 6-count opposite a 1NT opener|pg||
nt|ciaran: they may have ended up higher than w intended due to E having both majors?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Don't know their system but auction was 1N 2C; 2D 2H; 4H|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c9|pc|d6|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|VugraphPL1: 37%|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: Bill is rubbing it in....|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Not doubling 4@D beats me|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: well all started from Caplan not returning the 10 of @s after the 1st trick|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah a battle of the majors|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Right lets get this straight for information purposes. The Ireland team consisted of just 5 players a month ago for some strange reason. The one dropped out and then two more, ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: leaving just 2 of the original five. Why it is still 5 beats all understanding, not to mention a completely untried pairing|pg||
nt|bobholl: untried pairings at club level often work well but at international :)|pg||
nt|toobad: all roads led to glory there|pg||
nt|paulg: yes, frustratingly for the defence|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that is possible, if 2NT would have had that specific meaning |pg||
nt|paulg: does that invite 12-14 or 14-16?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: want to be careful not to push too far|pg||
mb|1D|nt|odysseus69: how about club pitch on 2nd diamond|pg||
nt|chessmaste: This will be a modest part score|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|rnc: 4@S - maximum pressure on EW|pg||
nt|jcomyn: take the money or what?|pg||
nt|bobholl: normal 4@S just making |pg||
nt|paulg: so I'd double 1@h with the West hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another surprise - afraid I would dbl with that perfectly shaped West hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|diumraid: In Running Scores -   N-Ireland 19, England 18, CBAI 15, IRELAND 15, SCOTLAND 12, WALES 11|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk5: Not sure what 2@C is. If a 2-suiter, I don't agree. It's a one-suited hand|pg||
nt|paulg: Rory and others have pointed out that ducking the @cK might be better|pg||
nt|aupillon: 1NT and pass|pg||
nt|paulg: committed to passing this I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: misfits galore |pg||
nt|paulg: 2@h now, nervously|pg||
nt|lestergold: only fit here is n/s clubs and that wont be bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: 1NT would be a strong rebid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anyone for 2@H as East?|pg||
mb|p|nt|aupillon: i see. They play weak NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w probhably manage 2d as cards lie|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2h by east seems reasonably normal certainly not absurd|pg||
nt|lestergold: passing one spade i dont agree|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rednaxela: I'm with Sheila on this one.  Give me some more 10s and 9s and I'd double.|pg||
nt|paulg: although Adamson is the one smiling when North makes a game forcing response|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Probably would not keep them out of game though|pg||
nt|paulg: and you make 2 spades and 3 clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: and not because or the 5/1 split i know about|pg||
nt|paulg: the pass will probably work out well but it seems a big position to take|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, partenr has high cards - I have a long suit which can take ruffing tricks|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dan_hohor: acording to Super 2 : bid 2S |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Roland did not like Super2 dan|pg||
nt|jcomyn: interesting slam|pg||
pc|s7|nt|aupillon: ( I told I spy your methods ) :)|pg||
nt|paulg: yes, but if you play a weak 1NT, and do not want to open it here, why not open 1@c and give yourself a chance of playing in all the suits?|pg||
nt|aupillon: good poin|pg||
nt|aupillon: t|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rnc: Yes, there are some work to do in 6@H|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dan_hohor: I know :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|toobad: or a club lead initially for that matter|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jcomyn: cards well placed though|pg||
pc|d2|nt|aupillon: i bet on declarer|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Just one part of it I don't like|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The bids?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: yes|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: brad revoked... I will have a cigarette|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he went to wash his face....what do you say now Bill.....|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: go and have one maestro , I will have one too :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: But the scheme is intimidating no doubt|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm devastated|pg||
nt|Walddk5: "Look at our defence to 1NT, guys. You dare not open 1NT now, correct?"|pg||
nt|Walddk5: "We can show anything, except majors at the 2-level"|pg||
nt|lestergold: at that stage in the auction you may be missing a game in hearts or no trumps or ev en spades|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cuttysark: As is pointed out, a club lead might beat this - and maybe if I had doubled, and partner had bid clubs, I woud not have been tested|pg||
nt|rednaxela: As with the light opening that led to the K@S being dropped earlier, light doubles can give away the location of honours when you end up defending.  Swings and roundabouts.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s5|nt|rnc: Indeed|pg||
nt|bobholl: !next (free after joey (silver))|pg||
nt|jcomyn: would think N bid 2C not 2H|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|paulg: i rather make a light double of 1@h and get spades into the game|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: so with my ruffing tricks and partners high cards, we should play in my long suit  |pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|aupillon: only if...|pg||
nt|aupillon: Q@h|pg||
nt|aupillon: @s|pg||
nt|aupillon: @d|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|paulg: quite, especially when the opposition is silent|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2h is a normal bid plain as that|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|aupillon: or ruff a heart|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|capercliff: they bid 1@d on 4 and missed 3N|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|aupillon: c'mon, please|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cuttysark: Not so serious revealing where the honours are here - these kings will either take tricks or not|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: even my dog felix just woofed to say he agrees|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|odysseus69: 8 tricks- next please|pg||

pc|d6|pc|s4|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|sT|nt|paulg: if you double, then it might only need partner not to bid spades (over, say, 2@d), to make the club lead attractive|pg||

nt|vugraphzkp: it looks like it was always making, but that def accelerated the play|pg||

nt|james_h: I'll leave that slam to Jacko the Irish team captain|pg||

nt|henryb: declarer"|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think that 6nt or 6@H is likely in the other room - i saw them play last week and they failed to bid a very east 7nt|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3s i fear is the limit for e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: wd|pg||
nt|ciaran: 2NT is 11/12 balanced|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you stayman or trasfer?|pg||
nt|werge: South had the hand for playing 3 @D|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder if NS have a method to bail out in @D at 3-level or lower.  I'd personally prefer that to 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: that will make on the diamond finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: *transfer|pg||
nt|mariner1: stayman and bid 2@H if no major in W|pg||
pc|h2|nt|paulg: 4@s will be keycard, and 5@d shows 2 of the 5 aces without the @hQ|pg||
nt|cindy: why do those passes keep getting alerted ?  :)   cause S really wants to bid ?|pg||
nt|paulg: Liz, our operator, is trying to alert the previous call|pg||
nt|paulg: but the bbo software is not quite as intuitive as you'd like (as an operator)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5-4-2-2?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Do you agree with S's pass over 1@h?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: or what we call "junk stayman" |pg||
nt|mariner1: of course I play garbage stayman|pg||
nt|sybarra: or so garbage is the technical term |pg||
nt|werge: It has no sense to keep dummy´s 12 remaining cards on the table now|pg||
nt|lestergold: and im notm surprised with the fifth spade and stiff dim|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cindy: see i thought it was super intuitive, knowing S really wanted to bid|pg||
nt|paulg: (that is, if you are using the keyboard rather than mouse to enter bids, alerts, etc)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: be delighted shortly stayed low|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like this will play well for declarer |pg||
nt|henryb: or defender|pg||
nt|viren169: another light opener by West has kept N/S quiet...|pg||
nt|werge: Hopeless contract|pg||
pc|h3|nt|viren169: Good start for defense|pg||
nt|othered1: That was quick.  Guess south didn't go looking for miracle 7-counts|pg||
nt|mariner1: junk is too kind a term for what I play :)|pg||
nt|rnc: Could possibly not win, if NS keep their fingers of the club suit|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good start|pg||
nt|ianrei: whats else - 1NT doesnt appeal|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is fixed|pg||
nt|viren169: just as well they will be saying!|pg||
nt|mowen: Erichsen's opening has killed the competition by bidding their suit|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure I'd be happy to put dummy down!|pg||
nt|othered1: such as @HK and @Sxx and @CK|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mowen: middle from 5 small - strange|pg||
nt|mowen: game with 11 opposite 12 but tough to beat|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ianrei: 2S doesnt seem to have much more that 6 tricks|pg||
nt|mowen: all over now as there is no way to get 4 spades and A@H|pg||
nt|viren169: spade and a diamond switch may have done it...|pg||
nt|viren169: not easy... we can see all 4 hands! |pg||
nt|viren169: And even then we are sometimes wrong.|pg||
nt|mowen: the best chance for the defence was a passive lead - say a club|pg||
nt|viren169: ducking may take Declarer of the scent!|pg||
nt|viren169: Espen doesnt miss much...|pg||
nt|viren169: except when he is playing golf!|pg||
nt|mowen: has to play A@H  as partner might have 5 good hearts|pg||
nt|viren169: then he is looking forever!|pg||
nt|mowen: the @HJ would have been better as south could duck his ace|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... |pg||
nt|lestergold: theyc also habve to ensufre they are not endplayed  too|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a bit of a test in defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: house picking up a few more imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: that KH has to be ditched uner the ace in due course|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: not strong enuf especially with oly Ax spade to overcqll 1n|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ppiglett: Gotta go - bye all|pg||
nt|eamongall: bye|pg||
nt|eamongall: golf ? |pg||
nt|ppiglett: Birthday lunch|pg||
nt|roswolf: the leaders who are the beneficiary of a large handicap are actually winning this set 9-1!|pg||
pc|cT|nt|eamongall: are you 48 today |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ralfwil: @s8 must be right!|pg||
nt|othered1: In a system that can start strong hands relatively low, I wonder why south didnt' take advantage of the system to sniff around for slam?|pg||
nt|mariner1: right for what?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: to play on the first lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc09/fc_main_en.htm  -|pg||
nt|mariner1: Tournament Site|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jallerton: There is a school of thought that 4th hand should overcall 1NT a lot more freely these days|pg||
nt|lestergold: now ace of hearts should be played|pg||
pc|s3|nt|othered1: wonder if there were a case for playing @SK at trick 1 to start @H?|pg||
nt|lestergold: to catch north napping|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will probably make i think|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ianrei: and the Hs are likely to be losers|pg||
nt|finch: the lead wasn't systemic|pg||
nt|henryb: I do not know whether South actually huddled before playing from 10x of @h, If he did, he should not have.|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|jallerton: on the basis that people open and resond very light|pg||
nt|ianrei: thats becase people open and respond on such rubbish|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcomyn: H 4-1 and both finesses wrong in minors - you might feel hard done by|pg||
nt|lestergold: you cant bid what you havent got because you hopethe oppos havent got what theyc say they have !|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its not generally winning bridge in my experience|pg||
nt|ianrei: declarer should guess this|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c8|nt|ralfwil: for two reasons. so partner can play another @s and must not guess his next play|pg||
nt|werge: No change, I think|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|finch: With the @D10 short, this will make 9 tricks fairly easily|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcomyn: oh no finesse in D only C|pg||
nt|viren169: diamond ducked would have worked better |pg||
pc|h5|nt|paulg: I can see Liz is catching up, because Brian Spears NEVER plays this fast :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ten of D lead has a good chance of success|pg||
nt|cindy: he drank my mountain dew|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to find based on the bidding...|pg||
nt|lestergold: u have to cash the ace early on these hands to do the doubleton honour throw in trick|pg||
nt|rnc: On bd 21 Lirarna played hearts in both rooms, 2@H (on 4-1) in OR and 4@H here - both down 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: may be too late now |pg||
nt|lestergold: thats likely|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzkp: No...South played in tempo on that trick|pg||
nt|werge: Bad @C-discard for West|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ianrei: now he can score a club ruff|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: well thats pretty misere|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|lestergold: 7 tricks that is|pg||
nt|roswolf: no need to unblock:)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mariner1: and making 5|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: a misdefence was induced|pg||
nt|lestergold: south couldnt think declarer was underleading ak9 surely?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: oh hes gone for perhaps the superior play of seting up a club trick o two|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|henryb: I think declarer will now get the @s right, as Townsend almost must have the !q for his opening|pg||
nt|mariner1: W could have led the Q@S when in with trump......as they held the 9@S too|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|ciaran: W squeezed now in the minors if S reads it|pg||
nt|lestergold: or three!!|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ciaran: E left him guarding both minors when he switched @DJ|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: well good card play by denning|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|mariner1: now a trapping endplay|pg||

nt|paulg: Adamson could open 2@d here, 5-9 HCP with both majors|pg||
nt|odysseus69: slam time|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW suffering a bit here, regrettably.|pg||
nt|paulg: this is getting closer to a Roland slam|pg||
mb|1C|nt|aupillon: one plays slam ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: should be a straightforward game here though, likely 3NT |pg||
nt|paulg: assuming you do not get a diamond ruff at trick 2|pg||
mb|1D|nt|paulg: but probably prefers points to be in the long suits|pg||
nt|cuttysark: An unattractive proposition with that diamond holding!|pg||
nt|lestergold: well N/S have an  exceelent 3n here which is ideally played by east to protect hearts doesnt matter as k onside- however this is close to a roland slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually not quite 12.89% so maybe even roland doesnt ant to be i nnit|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk5: I suspect that West took the save in the other room, which seems strange at love all with all those queens|pg||
nt|rnc: 4@H EW |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: clubs hearts and spades 3 finesses right unfortunately roland is let down by the unkind lie in the diamond suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: not to mention the latenative play of going for the drop in clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: so better stick to 3n ladies|pg||
mb|2S|nt|toobad: mary is definitely out of sorts or she would have claimed 10 at trick 9|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe an exclusion 4S?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: xx?|pg||
nt|capercliff: this is a slam, but is it biddable?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 3n will be wrong sidd now but heart is luckily right|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 3 @S or 21/2 @H now ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: even 4@S :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not many losers, but hard to see twelve winners |pg||
mb|3C|nt|dan_hohor: 4S|pg||
nt|toobad: ie madden|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Perhaps too warly in the morning?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: early!|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: ugh|pg||
nt|paulg: undo|pg||
nt|odysseus69: do they plat better minor or does 1 D promise 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5c no problem here either|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually 5c is a problem|pg||
nt|lestergold: could lose 2dims and a club|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bjacobs: It's easy to go down in 4@S|pg||
nt|rnc: The EW-cards fit very nicely together|pg||
nt|paulg: Martin Garvey, commentating on one of the other matches, will be saying that East has an automatic double of 1@c there|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I may throw up - or give up|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: thats a rather big 2H - I prefer 1S and then H support|pg||
nt|paulg: I've heard his team mates say the same|pg||
nt|toobad: at that rate i'm surprised he was released for the weekend|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If you lead from @SKxxx every time you have it it will eventually be right. Doesn't cost here|pg||
nt|paulg: 1@d shows 4|pg||
nt|toobad: promises 4 i think|pg||
nt|odysseus69: we assume South 4H|pg||
nt|paulg: they open 1@c with 4432|pg||
nt|aupillon: after this support and (the usual) magnificient opening bid, it could be called :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: right, didnt see the 4-0 break|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Particularly of you are not in it|pg||
nt|Walddk5: *if|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@S is rock solid|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: S very dissapointed of the outcome of the bidding|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: what a silly save in 5C, with all Q and J and no shape|pg||
nt|Walddk5: However, I don't think the South hand is suited for Michaels. You never know what to do on your next turn|pg||
nt|chick: 3 for me|pg||
nt|odysseus69: then 4H looks a very dubious effort|pg||
nt|aupillon: wait 5 minutes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hard to value things like Qx in a side-suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Well we don't know the auction|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's possible that West simply supported clubs and EAST saved|pg||
nt|bobholl: didn't even consider 4 :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whats wrong with a h lead on this auction|pg||
nt|bobholl: nothing succeeds but success|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: with south known to hold likely stiff diamon club finesse is probably odds on|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|aupillon: sure you have to stop in 4 but the beginning of the sequence were " promising'|pg||
nt|paulg: Qxxx Qx in the unbid suits, when partner has not splintered, suggests even looking for slam is dangerous|pg||
nt|lestergold: in terms of available spaces etc|pg||
pc|h3|nt|odysseus69: wouldnt mind 5-0 d break|pg||
nt|paulg: i wonder if she thought it was forcing|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|toobad: what book is that Liz??|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: otherwise south would have to have ten oplus cards in major without saying anything|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bobholl: even with this lead not a sure contract :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe not but it sure helps|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: long think here|pg||

pc|c6|nt|paulg: might also have no points|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade finesse didnt seem the most urgent play!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|toobad: a sad loss to our small nation, but we survived|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|Walddk5: In my book Michaels is not ideal with intermediate hands. It's better for weak or very strong hands|pg||

pc|c4|nt|rednaxela: Very brave of you.|pg||

pc|d3|nt|aupillon: and, even these ladies do not play slam with 24 HCP. My students do not play even game ...:(|pg||

nt|henryb: thank you Tim|pg||
nt|mariner1: wait forgot one was pitched, so could not have led Q@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: there is another chance for an agressive game swing though on last board|pg||
nt|roswolf: another potentially wild hand|pg||
nt|werge: 1 @H - 1 NT - and 3 NT is there|pg||
nt|werge: 2 @H doubled by South seems likely|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jallerton: 2@d = 18-20 balanced|pg||

mb|p|nt|jferg: east had prime cards for him|pg||

nt|roswolf: heavy overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: i'm told that I am doing Liz an injustice ... so perhaps Brian will be first to drug tested later|pg||
nt|viren169: Michaels here?|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@C?!?! not my choice... unless it show @C+@H|pg||
nt|mowen: so the 2@C opener turns up|pg||
nt|finch: 2@C 8-13 with both majors|pg||
nt|finch: if it's maximum, it can be 4-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|finch: 2@D inv+ relay|pg||
nt|ciaran: West looks more like a 1N overcall assuming that is natural|pg||
nt|mariner1: likely spot is 4@S with little chance|pg||
nt|werge: 2 @D is a joke in my bridge-world|pg||
nt|lestergold: no 2h doubled now Hans|pg||
nt|rnc: EW has a play for 5@D I think |pg||
mb|4H|nt|petepunt: still 24 brds to play but exciting times fr eng 1 and eng 2 i suspect|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: perhaps it does!|pg||
nt|sharkirl: prefer 3@S now from N|pg||
nt|viren169: some form of ghestem|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@c 4-4 majors|pg||
nt|ianrei: 11 easy trcks in H|pg||
nt|finch: 3@H shows 5=4=3=1 max|pg||
nt|finch: he could have bid 3@S 5-5 max, but this way he shows the diamonds as well|pg||
nt|petepunt: can they avoide 6@S now|pg||
nt|finch: well, Blackwood will avoid 6@S if nothing else will|pg||
mb|p|nt|mowen: blackwood|pg||
nt|finch: 4@D is RKCB in spades|pg||
nt|petepunt: b;wood in what suit|pg||
nt|finch: 4@C would have been rkcb in hearts|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@h 3-suiter with short diamonds, 11-15|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: pass terry|pg||
nt|ciaran: Very tough to beat 3NT here|pg||
nt|viren169: A bit passive by N/S|pg||
nt|finch: garvey deciding whether to show the void or not (and if so, how to)|pg||
nt|petepunt: 5@S is in danger|pg||
nt|finch: West will do well to find the ace of diamonds lead, but we don't know yet who will be declarer|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sharkirl: very much so|pg||
nt|viren169: now it is all about overtricks!|pg||
nt|othered1: Guess west is stuck for a bid in their system, 'cause a natural 2N wouldn't have occurred to me with those @S|pg||
nt|othered1: morth won't find @S lead, so positioning hand in west may be good.|pg||
nt|sybarra: as predicted |pg||
nt|rnc: 2@S showing 5+@H|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|paulg: well done for keeping up!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well done, wrong sided contract|pg||
nt|jferg: the contract might not have been as attractive if east did not have the dia q|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but would E bid 4H with:   Jxxxx  x   Qxx  KQxx ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he cant though can he?|pg||
nt|ianrei: 3NT shaky on S lead but ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n would be a very poor spot altho it make here because of fortunate layout|pg||
nt|mariner1: lead helps a little here,,,,,,,, @D lead is trouble for EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: and not one has the hammer|pg||
nt|werge: My grand... make 600|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ianrei: even with 30 points the 4-4 fit is better|pg||
nt|werge: - on a @H-lead|pg||
nt|rnc: 1@S of course|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|finch: 4NT two key cards without the queen of spades|pg||
nt|finch: pass = I do have clubs stopped quite well|pg||
nt|finch: good effort to stop in 4NT|pg||
nt|mowen: super sequence|pg||
nt|viren169: Welcome back!|pg||
nt|othered1: That should help west, but not playing !J may cost timing|pg||
pc|dA|nt|petepunt: they need quick def tricks so a@D poss|pg||
nt|jallerton: Interesting trump lead from Qxx|pg||
nt|mariner1: the trick is are there 9 before giving up 5|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, on several rational lines of play as cards lie|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like playing on @d is better than on @s A on side|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he is lucky that long @S does not also have A@D|pg||
nt|othered1: understandable that west is taking time on this.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: My reason is that the @d suit is covering more distributions|pg||
nt|othered1: could even come down to the position of the @D10 on some lines/lies|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks off|pg||
nt|lestergold: main point about a heart lead her is that east will only be able to enjoy 2diamond tricks|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ciaran: Even with the club wrong, N/S have 5C, 2S and 2H|pg||
nt|eamongall: 4333 8 count opposite strong NT ....hardly bids game |pg||
nt|eamongall: but maybe the opening bid in North tips the chances of making game in 3NT|pg||
nt|rnc: This is touch and go on a @H-lead. A spade finess is almost needed|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. |pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jferg: up with the heart ace and drive out the spade|pg||
nt|eamongall: however getting out the TONK tool for 2@Hs looks a good idea|pg||
nt|ciaran: cartainly can be made if you are in it and if you're going to play a 3 level contract..|pg||
nt|lestergold: only way of making is a first round spade finesse for theJK|pg||
pc|h3|nt|viren169: looks like +2|pg||
nt|petepunt: but, well stopped in last making contract:)|pg||
nt|othered1: he'll go after @S|pg||

nt|mowen: hi again|pg||
nt|viren169: We had a technical problem!|pg||
nt|mowen: so 3NT made on the last board|pg||
nt|viren169: I thought somebody threw the towel in... but not so!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Sorry all. Slight hitch here.|pg||
nt|viren169: Thks Tim...|pg||
pc|h7|nt|VugraphPL1: running scores http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/2009/krajowe/gpp/01elblag/emax.html|pg||
nt|cindy: in Boston they were taking samples to DNA test the players|pg||
nt|mowen: and on a good board for England|pg||
nt|mariner1: that @S pitch helped W|pg||
nt|othered1: very good chance that west now knows @S count, plus. |pg||
nt|mariner1: now a @H to hand and a @D to dummy......... not that easy to see|pg||
nt|othered1: No @S bid by south, no 6@S|pg||
pc|d4|nt|paulg: lots of problems with identity theft then?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But dangerous to play another @s. If he returns to the hand and plays another @s, he must duck|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to play @S right (guess) to hold|pg||
nt|mariner1: Q@S needed now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|viren169: unlucky not to be all 13 tricks!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: short pause for 'comfort break'|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: kill point is now|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|mariner1: got it right|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cindy: some kind of study to look at how bidding matches up to dna....im serious|pg||
nt|eamongall: however 1@S overcall does not indicate the power in the West hand |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|othered1: West is still OK if he plays @H over then @S, reads the spot and ducks|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ralfwil: @h2?? he wants a @s shift from S|pg||
nt|roswolf: south has to find the spade switch when he is in|pg||
nt|lestergold: why is north in such a hurry|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: you mean, correlated with number of X chromosomes? :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: had to duck it seems |pg||
pc|hK|nt|mariner1: so nicely done|pg||
nt|lestergold: the duck weas so obvious|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: a long mathc maybe getting tired|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: and now we have the @C's set up too |pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|roswolf: good one|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ciaran: well played|pg||
nt|eamongall: it is written that one can make 3N with less points when one lad is sandwiched between the rest of deck|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzkp: he claimed just @dA10 @hA and no more|pg||
nt|ciaran: looked like he had 4S, 4D and 2H there|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: loving life,  errr cards at moment|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|lestergold: is this right declarer ditching club winners |pg||
nt|sybarra: tricks to burn if he was watching the spots|pg||
nt|lestergold: or has he got tired too and not noticed the pips|pg||
nt|rnc: HOUSE is throwing imp's around them. I don't think they really can afford this vs a team like Lirarna (the better of the two teams in this HCP-tournament)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s6|pg||

nt|Walddk5: It is very unlikely that you miss a game if you overcall 1@S. Only rarely will you see all pass|pg||
nt|cuttysark: As predicted, a game swing out on board 4|pg||
nt|aupillon: game is 25 ! ( Only for some players who have 26 ...cards and only 23 points) Meckstroth told once that|pg||
nt|paulg: i think the fact that we are not seeing early claims is a reflection of the pressure ... few of the Lady Milne players are professionals|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s nice simple 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h|pg||
nt|lestergold: here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|chick: misfit both ways here|pg||
nt|rnc: Where did the 11th trick came from? Must have been +2 I suppose, or?|pg||
nt|toobad: NI bid the game on board 4, as i suspected|pg||
nt|paulg: E/W have a good double fit but the vulnerability will probably keep them quiet|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: i think she figured wasted s values with N |pg||
nt|odysseus69: is that a 2 suiter?|pg||
nt|paulg: 12 tricks looks impossible too|pg||
nt|toobad: tartan|pg||
nt|lestergold: at this vulnerability no potential for e/w saving profitably|pg||
nt|mdgraham: standards for opening bids these days...|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|aupillon: 4 hearts and make the tea|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnc: Time to stay calm on this one|pg||
nt|aupillon: they make thea tea, really ?|pg||

nt|paulg: and no-one has ever accused Maida of being pessimistic|pg||
nt|paulg: 2NT is jacoby|pg||
nt|paulg: style|pg||
nt|paulg: but i think 3@c is just natural|pg||
nt|lestergold: obviously not showing extras!!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4h imperturbable|pg||
mb|3H|nt|toobad: kept them ou of 4h|pg||
nt|toobad: out|pg||
nt|paulg: i think South should bid 3@H (encouraging) here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: does a new partnership know for sure it is a @H fit ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i hpe 3h is forcing|pg||
nt|diumraid: ****  LIVE  IN RUNNING from LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  N-IRELAND 60, SCOTLAND 52, IRELAND 47, ENGLAND 45, CBAI 40,  WALES 25  *****|pg||

mb|4D|nt|paulg: but I would sign off now|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcomyn: doesn tlike those 2 C|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes they do !|pg||
nt|lestergold: now is the time.... 5 level too high|pg||
nt|paulg: hopefully 4@d is a non-serious slam try|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: 4D = shortage|pg||
nt|lestergold: well that devalues the q dims to null points|pg||
mb|4H|nt|chick: operator, I think you missed a pass in there :)|pg||
nt|chick: cuebid opps suit is normally a limit raise or better ... if I had never played with someone, that's what I'd assume|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: small break here|pg||
nt|chick: still has to find the @HQ or set up @Ds for a spade pitch|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wont|pg||
nt|bobholl: my guess is that she will :)|pg||
nt|aupillon: clubs bid were depressing for a slam trial|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: disciplined pass by W|pg||
nt|paulg: a simple hand to play ... cash the long suit and hope that something (very) good happens|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Declarer will cash he long suit, but South can find four discards|pg||
nt|aupillon: small small|pg||
nt|paulg: the double looks like an instinctive reaction rather than a considered call|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: not that she could bid anything|pg||
nt|chick: I refuse to break that tie :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: this will be a quick claim|pg||
nt|lestergold: phew.... they ran out of steamjust in time|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: reminds her to lead one...|pg||
pc|s8|nt|paulg: Martin will be wondering if they can cash two clubs, or pump dummy and freeze the diamond suit|pg||
nt|paulg: both lines work on this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: or not|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|bobholl: kib says : duck d before playing H normal here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dan_hohor: but that was on the strong side Roland , AKJ , AKJ . A q in the majors will do for game|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Well, in that case bid the game yourself|pg||
nt|Walddk5: But who says partner isn't 2-1 in the majors?|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: so Alexander chickened out with 3S , as you can not control a Q here and there|pg||
nt|rnc: South's @D-opening silenced her. |pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcomyn: c back - but...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but heart looks right -with 8 hearts West might have bid|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jcomyn: my kingdom for a cluib|pg||

nt|toobad: good defence|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk5: 2@S did not promise support, North simply gavee preference|pg||

pc|d2|pc|hK|nt|aupillon: fortunately. There is a small shop, called NONSTOP behind my home. But it closes at 6 :)|pg||

pc|s5|nt|jcomyn: so she didnt find the H queen - TOLD YOU SO|pg||

nt|paulg: this looks a more interesting hand|pg||
nt|cindy: im not commenting on which female players seemed to have male dna|pg||
nt|jallerton: Wales have their first IMPs.  They bid and made the thin 6@c on board 5|pg||
nt|ciaran: Isn't the standard defense to this type of three suited opener "double and lead trump"|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: auction on 8: 1@s - 2@d - 2N - P - 4@c - P - 4@h - P - 4@s - end|pg||
nt|eamongall: 140 in the bag but I predict  imps out for Ireland|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: he didn't want the extra 30|pg||
nt|viren169: We need it!|pg||
nt|viren169: we need more good boards!|pg||
nt|othered1: That was ust a typical vul 3N.  Maybe odds-off, but you bid it.|pg||
nt|mariner1: slam EW here|pg||
nt|mariner1: Shirley with the more ethereal comments :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: we lost board 7!|pg||
nt|roswolf: on the grand 6@H was bid as predicted for 17 imps|pg||
nt|werge: This looks friendly - 620 E/W|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree MIke,  if foks have never played many long matches,  it takes it toll|pg||
nt|sybarra: *folks|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jcomyn: nothing to 4s here|pg||
nt|viren169: I think 3@S by North seems normal at that vul... playing 5-card majs |pg||
nt|viren169: another light opener!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Nice to play board 7. First a miss and than find @h 4-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|mowen: exciting hand - might be plenty of bidding|pg||
nt|finch: so far only five imps changed hands this set (4-1 to england) but a swing is coming on 23|pg||
nt|finch: I think you have to bid 4@S on the West hand here and hope|pg||
nt|ciaran: Very good slam here for N/S - no wasted values|pg||
nt|sybarra: S coning in with a gadget?  I guess not|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|paulg: 2@s is a strong jump shift ... a rare treatment in top level bridge nowadays|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can east pass?|pg||
nt|cindy: i hope not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3d by east operator|pg||
nt|sharkirl: they're not playing 5-card|pg||
nt|jallerton: Lebensohl|pg||
nt|lestergold: crads lie very badly for e/w here|pg||
nt|finch: on second thoughts, maybe that's a bit aggressive|pg||
nt|ciaran: Thanks Tim!|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@d= 5+@h, 9+ HCP|pg||
nt|eamongall: Garvey and Cooke should stroll into this as they are very practiced bidders|pg||
nt|petepunt: @C was 4+ here|pg||
nt|roswolf: house is getting close to its original handicap advantage (99)|pg||
nt|lestergold: it happens in the uk trials every year the less experienced flake out|pg||
nt|lestergold: they are very gruelling|pg||
nt|rnc: Yes, as I said in the previous segment, the psychological factor is not to be overseen. Long matches combined with broadcasting and fatigue can set pressure|pg||
mb|3D|nt|cindy: i like strong jump shifts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 7@d|pg||
nt|mariner1: mirrored minors means only 6 makes|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: but 2@S was last makeable spot|pg||
nt|cindy: i dont believe in using my bids to improve part scores|pg||
nt|sharkirl: but wud seem obvious on that bidding that p has 5 @Ss|pg||
nt|petepunt: 6@D is a good spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: more useful to use them to get to games and slams|pg||
nt|viren169: another opportunity for slam here for Ireland|pg||
nt|lestergold: even 3d looks like it cannot make but N/S are not far off making 4h|pg||
nt|ianrei: only two losers but lack of entries make life difficlt|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem is the entries needed to the nortyh hand for taking all those winning finesses|pg||
nt|jallerton: but can build a @c trick for a @s pitch just losing 1 trick in each side suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: Maybe forcing dummy stops this plan|pg||
nt|mowen: 3 small clubs is bad|pg||
nt|ianrei: 5C with 3 likely tricks looks risky|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5@c gives EW a decision though|pg||
nt|petepunt: even 6@c|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ciaran: Can't be beaten, but declarer may sweat before making!|pg||
nt|finch: yes, if partner has club length it's a disaster, if partner has club shortage and extras he will protect|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good decision by Howard.  Even with all his defense, 4H is cold|pg||
nt|ianrei: but 5C goes for 1100 on best defence|pg||
nt|ciaran: Having said that, this could be very expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: yes, that did happen. Immediate 4@h reply!|pg||
nt|ciaran: the commentators curse, eh, Eamon!|pg||
nt|petepunt: 4@D may agree @H here though|pg||
nt|mowen: very light opening even by the standards of this match|pg||
nt|bobh1: the @c play seems irresponsible|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has some play here|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: and West has not doubled|pg||
nt|mariner1: .|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: oh right, 7@D does make, only 6@S|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think cold|pg||
nt|mariner1: Lirarna is taking a lot of chances and they are paying off..... still a long way to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: but can ruff and play @c instead|pg||
nt|petepunt: most roads lead to 2 off|pg||
nt|mowen: Garvey need sto ruff A@C and play K@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: N finding this auction fascinating |pg||
nt|sybarra: now S |pg||
nt|werge: 4 @s is the right spot|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: i dont believe in weak 2@D bids, especially this weak|pg||
nt|viren169: Norman will be going backwards now at every opportunity!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cindy: it looks like a book 2D bid if thats what you play|pg||
nt|viren169: well done... short and simple seq...|pg||
nt|james_h: pragmatic 6@c|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N forcing raise and 3@D enquiring,,,,|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In sweden many players show a side suit as a positive response, so this is a possibility to reach 7@d|pg||
nt|mariner1: well no slam leaves door open for San Sac in Open|pg||
nt|ralfwil: unbelieveable!|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H lead helps defense|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg: 4@h has appeal to protect partner's minor suit holdings|pg||
nt|jferg: oops at least one too high|pg||
nt|jallerton: retaining a dummy entry for a major suit lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5@c looking very clever now|pg||
nt|ianrei: Howard judged well |pg||
nt|mariner1: hard to think W would not have bid slam|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: i toh spade switch thast given the contract|pg||
nt|ianrei: thats a friendly switch|pg||
nt|mowen: and Cooke must not ruff it|pg||
nt|finch: the king of diamonds discard may be enough for Cooke not to ruff|pg||
nt|mowen: now north must not rise with A@H|pg||
nt|finch: but against that it's very very very hard not to take the setting trick against a vulnerable game|pg||
nt|finch: sorry I was a trick out, if north ruffs the second club he can't discard the @DK|pg||
nt|mowen: the 2 over game force has allowed the club fit to be found|pg||
nt|viren169: Aceless 9 count? Not good in my book!|pg||
nt|mowen: but will be pass?|pg||
nt|viren169: 1 for the road? this is high enough!|pg||
nt|mowen: easy to see 6@C could be right|pg||
nt|viren169: but not on this hand...|pg||
nt|mowen: add the AorQ of @Cs to east|pg||
nt|viren169: At least Norman didnt bid 3@C over 2D!|pg||
nt|mowen: I think he will bid on|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 3n on top hoiwebver fascinating|pg||
nt|rnc: But on the summary, even if HOUSE fails to win, they have really made a good effort in this tournament. Beeing ranked as no 12 (among 19), they'd crushed no 1, no 2 and are now ...|pg||
nt|rnc: facing no 4 in the finals. And has done a good job so far.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: time for a bookburning then|pg||
nt|viren169: With a void in pd suit and facing possibly only 4 card @C suit...pass is right!|pg||
nt|mowen: I am wrong again - some decision|pg||
nt|viren169: Well done Espen!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: mullered the defence in one fell swoop|pg||
nt|ianrei: should now make - i think a second D at trick 2 made this impossible|pg||
nt|ianrei: so who should have doubled 5C ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: first failing contract of the day?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s should make but there are some nasty suprises availabkle inr4s as we can see|pg||
nt|lestergold: but where are they going?|pg||
nt|lestergold: combined 29 with their best fit a 4/4 missing two of the top honours|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh dear  too high |pg||
nt|rnc: This could be a possible recover for NS|pg||
nt|rnc: The lead down to 32 - smallest margin so far in this final|pg||
nt|lestergold: but about to rise again probably|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: Fahrenheit 451|pg||
nt|james_h: he has run into a bad breal in clubs tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: now ruff dim finesse heart cash ace and play spade and take club finesse losing only a dim and a spade that cost maybe two tricksw that switch|pg||
nt|jallerton: what else could be have done? @d at trick 2 is ruffed, @cQ led|pg||
nt|viren169: Espen has seen some of Norman's bid before!|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|rnc: Presumably bd 32 would (and should) be a big pic up for Lirarna. But will wait and see...|pg||
nt|lestergold: a double would beat this out of hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: but maybe south thinks they may be on way to 6|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmmmn are we out of control or landing in 5 @S |pg||
nt|rnc: Mayday, mayday...|pg||
nt|lestergold: hasnt landed yet!|pg||
nt|lestergold: still on final approach|pg||
nt|lestergold: with an engine failure and fire|pg||
nt|sybarra: Houston,  are we on the glide path?|pg||
nt|rnc: Like the Canadian TV-series about airplane crashes...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ciaran: Had S ducked that, this would have been interesting|pg||
nt|mowen: why would east bid 3@C on 4cards?|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not sure west's hand is a slam force, but it looks like no try was made.  And that doesn't feel right.  But do they open garbage hands with bad suits?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cindy: you should write to them|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bettertake that HA soon|pg||
nt|james_h: break|pg||
pc|hT|nt|viren169: no chance of an overtrick.... |pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, South making sure of this|pg||
nt|lestergold: beam me up scottie|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|petepunt: K@D maybe a bit extravagent ?|pg||
nt|mowen: it was when pard does not have a @D|pg||
nt|mowen: contract is now cold|pg||
nt|finch: yes, if West works out what was going on.  He might after drawing trumps and a heart up.|pg||
nt|lestergold: its star wars|pg||
nt|lestergold: no double but plenty trouble|pg||
nt|rnc: Imp's come and imp's go. (Hope I didn't say too much now...) :)|pg||
nt|werge: It s really a friendly match - without doubles|pg||
nt|lestergold: and we are eally friendly commentators|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: should have forced duumy to ruff then declarer can take heart finesse and has nine tricks but could still be playing next week for the tenth|pg||
nt|eamongall: I was going to say ...what happened ... but I know i will get 100 answers ..."Nothing" |pg||
nt|ralfwil: There had been a nice defence with @sQ second after AK|pg||
nt|othered1: That grand was a 30 imp swing.  Even had it worked out for Lirarna they would still have a tough row to hoe to get back into the match.|pg||
nt|werge: Sure - for ever|pg||
nt|rnc: Yes, everybody is nice and friendly - as it should be.|pg||
nt|sybarra: S may be afrad to "give the hand away" with a X |pg||
pc|c6|nt|paulg: but partner could conceivably only have 5 hearts if he didn't want to introduce a weak 4-card minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: scoreboard about to hit high gear|pg||
nt|marlowepi: by my calculations that equals Celsius 200. i wonder if that is the title in Europe|pg||
nt|petepunt: looks like cahnces now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jallerton: i think @s switch gives the 11th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Howard told Garvey "I've got king-jack"|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3 aces and a side suit with KQ! |pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mowen: what else is there to do|pg||
nt|viren169: good start for defense... taking out the entry early!|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|viren169: just bidding his shape out over 2N|pg||
nt|mowen: for what reason - to tell the oppo what to lead?|pg||
nt|viren169: N does best to pitch a heart...|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|finch: sometimes it's hard to envisage any layout where you are making|pg||
nt|finch: if South is 2227 with Hx in diamonds, he makes now by heart ruff, ace and a diamond|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed ed|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he has limited defence to other possible lsams from his point of view but im a money player and im greedy i gerDOUBLE|pg||
nt|rnc: And in fact, it has been a very nice atmosphere through the whole final (and the whole tournament in fact)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ianrei: jeffreys right - the CQ holding the lead works|pg||
nt|mowen: 2nd disaster for n/s|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: sorry 218|pg||
nt|lestergold: true if q of club led makes|pg||
nt|finch: although that's wildly unlikely given the diamond discard|pg||
nt|ciaran: England in 4HX on the board where Ireland made 5HX|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: so maybe nom defence to beat it|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rnc: If I go for a coffee now, pls dont tell me the contract made later :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: i don;t think the 3S bid should be forcing in that sequence|pg||
nt|cindy: no not 3S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade back and two off after one winning finesse|pg||
nt|mariner1: and 4 trumps|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|werge: Fine for sure - but doubles are pary of the game|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rnc: Down already, then it's safe|pg||
pc|dA|nt|eamongall: that would make a grown man cry ...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|viren169: not sure this line will succeed!|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: there are a lot of hands where W would want to try for game in case E has something of a fit, but if not he should be able to get out. after all it is not like he would ever want E ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't think it's a slam force, unless their opening bids are sound|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mariner1: well I would take my chances|pg||
nt|othered1: But I think after not taking a bid, east would cooperate with any slam try and that west never gave him a chance|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the likelihood of some other slam making seemed remote especially witrh east showing the strong hand|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Perhaps 3@C or 3@D is better|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: yes...|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: at least defines the hand better|pg||
nt|aupillon: another game, only|pg||
nt|paulg: perhaps a more competitive board|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|odysseus69: do we bid as South?|pg||
nt|toobad: yes|pg||
nt|aupillon: we want slams, we want 6/6 hands, we want 1400 down, some nerve, what...|pg||
nt|lestergold: have to go now bye for now cu |pg||
nt|mdgraham: bye Mike|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jcomyn: where now?|pg||
nt|lestergold: thx Mike and Paul enjoyed commentating with u see u all again|pg||
nt|mdgraham: chance for Wales - double|pg||
nt|paulg: a reasonable shot, they are unlikely to make overtricks|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cuttysark: Would they be playing 3rd and 5th, John, or is this a cunning piece of deception?|pg||
nt|paulg: With limited entries to dummy Martin may find the winning spade line|pg||
nt|toobad: yes 3 and 5|pg||
nt|paulg: they play 3&5 all the time|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4C now from North then 5D seems the way forward|pg||
nt|capercliff: 10 tricks on the @s finnesse?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 2@D maybe @D+major?|pg||
nt|paulg: the same can also be said of any EW contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: despite the score, these hands seem quite quiet|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jcomyn: sticky wicket|pg||
nt|rnc: Yes|pg||

mb|d|nt|bobholl: think indeed @D + another|pg||
nt|aupillon: disaster, the other table ?|pg||
nt|paulg: why double 4@h when you double 5@H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: a fairly brisk double|pg||
mb|5H|nt|chick: a kib suggests @H or (@S+ longer m)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: 2d seems to be dont|pg||
nt|bobholl: can't decide on dont or the kibs suggestion :)|pg||
nt|chick: 5 other kibs (at least 4 Irish) say @H or (@S+ longer m)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well N didnt know what it was|pg||
nt|aupillon: hopa !|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if you ask you shall get, Andrei|pg||
nt|chessmaste: East's bidding here is ....interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: 3NT is also OK should they get there|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: they did|pg||
nt|aupillon: nononon|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: W is pushy|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North may well switch to a spade, and I don't think it realistic for declarer to get that right :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3D risks getting too high when North has a bit less than she has- it looks good on this layout|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed...|pg||
mb|d|nt|chick: sure, if really  @H or (@S+ longer m)   then 2H is pretty much forced|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or not|pg||
nt|toobad: lol mystic Liz|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Needs new crystal ball|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: One of my pet peeves. I much prefer Gazzilli, but I guess 1NT isn't forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: brave|pg||
nt|paulg: or more coffee|pg||
nt|paulg: this is not a good advert for their method, which I'm guessing is supposed to be Acol-like|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West's club holding is.....disappointing|pg||
nt|paulg: Grant's 4@h had done the trick, but then she felt obliged to show her second suit ... so perhaps 4@h was not the best initial bid|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jcomyn: what happend the movie scoresheet|pg||
nt|chick: probably lost by the crash|pg||
nt|chick: well so far about 1/2 the Irish kibs say the same :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: sry have lost the play. dec has 1st 6 tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: then will have finessed @D at rick 2|pg||
nt|bobholl: trickk|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West might have thought that 4@H had fast-arrival overtones|pg||
nt|capercliff: did she maybe expect more for the 4@h bid?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dan_hohor: the girls are running out of boards, looks like the grand turk will have his name written in golden leters on the Victorian Bridge Association Pennabt board :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dan_hohor: Pennant|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: yes...good performance for the Grand Turk|pg||
nt|toobad: its Ciara's style .......... she is an aggressive bidder|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|rnc: Ahh, that's the way to solve bad scores - just let everything crash. Shall try to remember that trick :)|pg||
nt|paulg: play a club now ... any diamond ruff doesn't cost|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: might lose to the @HJ ?|pg||

nt|odysseus69: except in slam deals|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|Walddk5: A little early. N-S have very good boards to be compared, 31 and 32|pg||
pc|s6|pg||

nt|chick: hmmm didn't cover?|pg||
nt|toobad: no claims............ever??|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnc: This solved some problems|pg||
pc|c6|nt|toobad: im dont fault her for the slam after the 3nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can always hope that the other table will reach 5@H, but somehow I doubt it  |pg||
nt|paulg: well read Mike|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|aupillon: adrenaline, didn't get the luck supposed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Maybe 2@D would not have been forcing. |pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|dan_hohor: true , you never know|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|chick: maybe she didn't realize the 8 was next highest|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|aupillon: Technically speaking : what is stronger : 3@h or 4@h ? I play 4@h weaker|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In Acol land West's 4@H is a sign off|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3@h is usually stronger|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: big swing coming|pg||

pc|sT|pg||

nt|james_h: I must doubbe more of your slams John|pg||
nt|ciaran: well 6@C would certainly make after a heart lead to the A|pg||

nt|jcomyn: well E will have a say in the final contract|pg||

nt|ciaran: I bet he doesn't bid|pg||

nt|jcomyn: no I am outnumbered|pg||
nt|viren169: not on that line...|pg||
nt|mowen: the play looked right|pg||
nt|mariner1: now told that HOUSE started with a 99 point handicap|pg||
nt|sybarra: bob you probably didnt plan on 2 up tricks there|pg||
nt|bobh1: Q@D was a remarkable play|pg||
nt|mariner1: no games here it seems|pg||
nt|othered1: House now needs to win over 3 imps/board for the rest of the match, a very tough order|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice play in 4@h for NS. Crossruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: (I dont have the pound sign)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont play that high a stake id like to against some i know|pg||
nt|rnc: Still 8 bds to score, and the margin is down to 29...|pg||
nt|lestergold: how many to play here?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|viren169: 1H by West will keep North quiet...|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: wales looking like a top flight team now |pg||
nt|viren169: best not to open with those hands! And you dont have that problem!|pg||
nt|mowen: so 7@D with a good view in clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: multi |pg||
nt|sybarra: up to 32|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|viren169: 6@D will be good to reach!|pg||

nt|viren169: 4/5@S by south|pg||
nt|mowen: 5@S looks too much to me|pg||
nt|mariner1: Ed you are being too kind to W, imho|pg||
nt|mariner1: well S steals the 3N from EW|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@s?|pg||
nt|lestergold: ??|pg||
nt|sybarra: check movie you can tell |pg||
mb|2N!|nt|lestergold: i prefer a neg double with north's hnad|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, I think they play dbl as clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: O'Gorman getting some Lucozade ...|pg||
nt|eamongall: make sure he does not spill it ....lucosade stains ...|pg||
nt|viren169: Tough as 1C may be short... E/W play 5-card majs|pg||
nt|othered1: Today half the field opens: Jxxxx, KQx, x, KQJxx.  and you're not safe at the 5-level|pg||
nt|mariner1: Q@D stiff helps here|pg||
nt|othered1: @CKQJx only|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: ty Peter|pg||
nt|viren169: North's having nothing of it!|pg||

mb|3C|nt|ianrei: N can back in now to reach their D partscore|pg||
nt|bobh1: not enough entries to the W hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: well they couldnt reach their best spot namely three dims|pg||
nt|ianrei: no - N has sold out to 2S|pg||
nt|lestergold: at least they will beat 2s|pg||
nt|petepunt: daf gary won solver medal a few years ago in commonwealth fairlt exp.  Townsend Gold jet-lagged suspect|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he has a loser in each suit best defense,,,,,, unless they help|pg||
nt|mariner1: N might have risked 3@H here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 to go inc this|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 10 asking for middle suit!?|pg||
nt|viren169: N/S have done enough...|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: i would have doubled 2@d here|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer now should get the diamonds right to make her contract on the @C lead|pg||
nt|ianrei: as long as the cash their C tricks after taking the ruff|pg||
nt|eamongall: Theres been a good deal on Lucozade in Ireland recently ...4 litres for 4 euros..two large bottles|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: it is a large bottle he has|pg||
nt|petepunt: brd 6 will  hurt eng tho'|pg||
nt|chick: they just returned from Australia, right?|pg||
nt|mowen: 5@S has ensured that England bid a slam|pg||
nt|viren169: wow... a bit pushy!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I vote fro a trumph lead from W|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: needs to get out of the way with that KC|pg||
nt|ianrei: if N puts S in with the CK after taking his ruff it will make|pg||
nt|jallerton: If you partner opens light, you need to excercise caution in response|pg||
nt|ianrei: the D lie well, others do not|pg||
nt|ianrei: N will do well to get this in|pg||
nt|othered1: Playing a limited opening bid system, north reasonably decided not to sniff about for @H slam.|pg||
nt|othered1: In standard methods, north would have had to take stronger action.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|james_h: nice work|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good auction - 3H splinter agreeing clubs|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - but he has seen many openings like this from South|pg||
nt|rnc: Yes, and still another 2 to score, since OR is a bit late. They have played 24 boards so far|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be an interesting ending to the match|pg||
nt|rnc: Indeed, now down to 17 imp's...puuh|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this isnt making|pg||
nt|lestergold: well shouldnt|pg||
nt|rnc: better take the insurance, yes :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jferg: no dislike of lead|pg||
nt|james_h: next|pg||
nt|lestergold: im concerned about the second club loser disappearing on the fourth heart|pg||
nt|mowen: maybe expecting a save|pg||
nt|viren169: Is this time for a restricted choice lesson?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: EE says 'captain's orders@@ !!|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|paulg: as it is, no-one seems to have bid their majors ... perhaps this is tipping point of the minor-suit comeback|pg||
nt|ciaran: Diamonds sit pretty well for declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: but then I don't know what constitutes a "small" bottle|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ciaran: Good restraint from Selway|pg||
nt|viren169: maybe 1-off?|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u there is a third dim to deal with|pg||
nt|jallerton: has chances in all the suits|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: how would you like the suit?|pg||
nt|jallerton: The problem was the 1NT bid.  S not expecting a stiff heart in partner's hand|pg||
nt|ciaran: looks like 4H is a likely make, but would be very pushy to bid it|pg||
nt|petepunt: yes yea cup were doing well i think|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Thats true, but not giving a chance.....|pg||
nt|lestergold: not best switch|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm...|pg||
nt|sybarra: and...|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ciaran: I think I'd have overcalled 2@S with such a good suit and shape|pg||
nt|jcomyn: over 1S u mean |pg||
nt|ciaran: Yes|pg||
nt|james_h: I dont doubt you for 1 sec Ciaran|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but that might be systemic|pg||
nt|ciaran: Well since a 1S response only shows 4, a 2S overcall should be natural|pg||
nt|jcomyn: it would with me but you never know|pg||
nt|james_h: For the Kibs ... Like most good players Ciaran sees the silver lining never the cloud|pg||
nt|mowen: I think denning needs to lead the @C9 to beat this|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|paulg: @sK now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jferg: low to enc|pg||
nt|jferg: is there system|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when Qxxxx in dummy i switch to suit preference|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jallerton: 4@s 2@h 2@d|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jferg: true so club 10 would suggest hearts|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ianrei: W should have ducked the D|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree that west must try to make a slam try and not just inquire about generic strength or side x.  But to force to slam is wildly gambling unless your openings are very sound|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jallerton: still off.  E has to come to a trick in each suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: apart from @d of course|pg||
nt|ianrei: he has 4D, 2S and 2 Aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: but no comms|pg||
nt|ianrei: if he puts in the H10, E has to get off lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think there were considerably more hands where slam makes than not,,,,, I'm a|pg||
nt|mariner1: bidder|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|petepunt: had some chances if @S right|pg||
nt|viren169: lots of money going on Norman going down!|pg||
pc|cK|nt|viren169: Defense still needs to be careful...|pg||
nt|finch: this is going a couple off I think with the spade finesse wrong and both heart honours wrong|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: if readable as middle yes|pg||
nt|finch: yes, the @SK onside was a necessary start to make it|pg||
nt|petepunt: might well be 3 off after @S ducked|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: which spade will he play|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ianrei: needs to play SQ|pg||
nt|viren169: I with Norman to make it!|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry she|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|paulg: @s2 asking for diamond back|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cindy: how could it be readable ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: and exit in @d|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mowen: so England going for it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think W is going to wish he took that other trick (@H)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mariner1: so off 1 very good here|pg||
nt|othered1: Look at only your hand and partner's opening then take a stab was once popular.  Then the Culbertsons beat up Buller & Co and that style faded away|pg||
nt|mariner1: next session here in 58 minutes,,,,,,,,,,,|pg||

nt|mowen: perhaps someone should have saved|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: small break|pg||
nt|viren169: Not easy!|pg||
nt|mowen: no doubt England would then bid and make 7NT|pg||
nt|viren169: board 21... 6@D was reached at the other table!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|viren169: Now North has a lot of exit cards for 1-off|pg||
nt|finch: it's 3 off anyway if they get it right|pg||
nt|finch: East might have invited rather than raising to 3 on a flat 9-count with no 10s and a couple of jacks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: not obvious to lead a top club honor. heart a very likely alternative. we can;t have very many clubs to run and they are only in 1NT. maybe better to use them as entries, and hope ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to build tricks elsewhere|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d8|nt|petepunt: sat evn players always optimistic :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|cindy: it could be the only one he has|pg||

nt|chick: but can NS stay out of an unmakeable game?|pg||
nt|paulg: time for a slam|pg||
nt|toobad: good slam here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sheila macdonald was not talked out of bidding on board 6 (she rarely is) so a nonvul game swing to Scotland|pg||
nt|paulg: yes, but I don't think it will faze N/S particularly .. part of their aggressive game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes... the price you pay in the trenches |pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk5: Not a board the Caplan team likes at this point|pg||

nt|capercliff: Scotland walking on water at the moment|pg||
nt|paulg: it has appeal|pg||

nt|mdgraham: still a mountain to climb for Wales though|pg||
mb|2H|nt|toobad: E will give that a whirl|pg||
nt|paulg: i think Martin can transfer to hearts and then bid 5@d|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But how to reach 6@D ow?|pg||
nt|toobad: i agree|pg||
nt|paulg: i was discussing their methods with them but do not know what they finally settled on|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Tricky area, methods when 3NT is the firts natural bid|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I mean strif....|pg||
nt|paulg: if they have not changed then 4@c is Baron|pg||
nt|toobad: do they not usually play together?|pg||
nt|paulg: which would actually work well here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, lots, but everybody tinkers with obscure areas of the system, then cannot remember what was agreed?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: What did you advise, Paul?|pg||
nt|paulg: i suggested some methods suggested by Frances Hinden ... so 4@c is a relay asking why you bid 3NT, 4@d is start of signoff|pg||
nt|paulg: and other bids are mild, non-forcing, slam tries|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I do - partner had a wasted spade ace only 4 diamonds yet slam was laydown - was worth 4D for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: 4s in the bag|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@H negative free bid or F suppose F|pg||

mb|2S|nt|paulg: even more so playing 4-card majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: now I'm doubting myself|pg||

nt|bobholl: guess this will make :)|pg||
nt|james_h: I prefer to get the hand off the chest in one bid, I'm not a fan of 2s with such a potentially powerful hand and a known 9 card fit|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5 @H is lucky save but they won't bid it i guess|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I guess Anne expected slightly more for 3NT|pg||
nt|toobad: good bid........ no decisions now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk5: Quick claim. Draw trumps and show your cards, condecing two heart tricks|pg||

nt|aupillon: good|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|bobholl: bad guess :)|pg||
nt|james_h: if you dont, you are relying on the opps to save you so that you can make another bid|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|nt|jcomyn: got away with it last time so...|pg||
nt|chick: at least this one won't need defense help to make :)|pg||

nt|james_h: 4s is cold here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|capercliff: 2@s is a rather mild view|pg||
nt|paulg: i think Cliff (and I) would have a mild rebid question on the East hand opposite our "up to 11" 1NT, easier for Lee here|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I expect declarer is happy|pg||
nt|odysseus69: does that mean that she is not allowed to bid todays slams|pg||
pc|sT|nt|james_h: 3c is also a reasonable open by south|pg||

nt|fabsayc: ew need to play 3NT|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@H by N/S|pg||
nt|finch: another hand where EW may get a bit high.  11 opposite 11 may be 'opening bid opposite opening bid' but that doesn't mean game|pg||
nt|finch: (unless you are Meckwell)|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|cindy: yes :)|pg||

nt|roswolf: you would be suprised|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|cindy: they need to play 1Nx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H strikes me as a recipe for disaster|pg||
nt|cindy: what is W piping up about ?|pg||
nt|ciaran: it certainly is a sound debut - this has not been a set for bidding pessimistically|pg||
nt|james_h: I like your style, but it means you are always on the limit|pg||
nt|sharkirl: yes, just 3 losers|pg||
nt|viren169: West seems to have been brushed aside looking at the best hand at the table...|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think there is enuf work to do in 5d altho on this lay out 6 may roll in|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, 5@d is more realistic|pg||
nt|lestergold: i preecit that they will not get higher than 5|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: upgraded to first-class|pg||

nt|mariner1: ED you check for controls and bid it,,,,, no stab to it,,,,,,, you are too conservative|pg||

mb|2N|nt|ciaran: With evey finesse right, looks like there are 11 tricks available in spades|pg||

nt|werge: claim...!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: we are boringly agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: huh|pg||
nt|viren169: dble will hold declarer to 5/6 tricks on good defense!|pg||
nt|ianrei: how about 3NT - they might bid that|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@d - how strong is that?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well now that any bit of candyfloss counts as a stop for nt purposes that may be true|pg||
nt|ianrei: surely 2H FSF?|pg||
nt|jallerton: they play strong @c but even so|pg||
nt|eamongall: Wales by 20 against North|pg||
nt|petepunt: correct|pg||
nt|petepunt: need to play 2N as t/o and al with most 8+ i believe|pg||
nt|petepunt: balance with most suitable 8+|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops slam if no @c lead :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now let´s see if S trusts his partner with a small|pg||
nt|werge: Jack from dummy - to test South|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: a lot of good players upgrade for playing strength - fine as long as your opponents know|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@C was checkback...|pg||
nt|bobh1: down by 60, clear to splinter in @c's|pg||
nt|lestergold: but when players are tired they can be as w have seen very erratic and the play standard has deterioted markedly|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: and what about N and that 3D ?|pg||
nt|jferg: over here we bid if we have nothing otherwise passing suggests we want to penalise the opposition|pg||
nt|fabsayc: aha|pg||
nt|cindy: so to stay out of trouble, you have to stay home|pg||
nt|ianrei: N/S can make 3NT|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@c = @c+@h|pg||
nt|ianrei: if D are lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: S can make 3NT, not N|pg||

pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: so what if you have xxx xxxx xxx xxx|pg||
nt|ciaran: ..for E/W with half the points and a 9 card fit, 1@D is their limit|pg||

nt|sharkirl: carnage|pg||

nt|roswolf: this could get quite high if west is adventurous|pg||
nt|lestergold: im sympathetic because being diabetic its themajor reason why i am not up to long matches|pg||
pc|sT|nt|james_h: double is a support double|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they cant unravel the clubs so tis would make if thatswhere they play|pg||
nt|finch: 2@C artificial of some form (probably forcing 2@D) - I guess 2@H is 5-4 majors invitational now|pg||
nt|finch: you were right, Steve|pg||
nt|viren169: lost their heart fit?!?!|pg||

nt|marlowepi: nothing that some acapulco gold couldn;t fix|pg||

pc|s5|nt|sharkirl: ??|pg||
nt|viren169: 4N by West is a possibility as pointed out by some specs|pg||
nt|sharkirl: operator?  did he not play the Jack?|pg||
nt|viren169: I expect hearts to be found in the other room!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cindy: and take your st bernard with you everywhere|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok plan B, try to let this make|pg||

nt|lestergold: hm|pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulg: at the other table North will play this in 1NT|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer is making an effort here... not sure about the defense!|pg||
nt|sharkirl: I can't believe this defence by Mesbur?  perhaps he assumed Holland had 5 @Ss|pg||
nt|viren169: Easy for us... we can see all 4 hands... |pg||
nt|finch: yes, he can effectively cross ruff and come to quite a few tricks|pg||
nt|mowen: and go down I guess|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jallerton: in fact the hearts are blocked so probably OK|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: wait, i am confused, whose bidding are we talking about? i thought all this was prompted by cindy's comment about the 2H call, but now it seems we are duiscussing S|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|viren169: Yes all seems a bit strange... Maybe he felt sorry for Holland!|pg||
nt|sharkirl: playing 5@D undoubled in Open Room|pg||

nt|mowen: south is sort of squeezed|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: wasnt finess marked?  can it cost?|pg||
nt|lestergold: wasnt the heart finesse a safety play as well as an overtrick play?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|eamongall: Garvey will be heading for home shortly losing just @DA |pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: 6@S on a non @D lead here...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: 2@d =18-20 BAL (they treat 4441 as BAL)|pg||

mb|d|nt|cindy: thats what i thought too !|pg||
nt|jferg: np  banter is good|pg||
nt|viren169: This hand could go anywhere!|pg||
nt|ianrei: so they going to reach 3NT instead of the good but unlucky 5D|pg||
nt|mowen: another big hand - @D lead to beat 6@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: 3NT looks clear now, but not an easy contract to play on the spade lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: no, just 2@d|pg||
nt|ianrei: 4H E/W is not too bad either|pg||
nt|jallerton: John Howard was happy with 2@d|pg||
nt|rnc: They get per match (per 32 bd-segments)|pg||
nt|roswolf: into the valley of death?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hmwell another Eva vulnerable overcaqll of dubiousm merit|pg||
mb|4H|nt|viren169: dble= support or general take-out?|pg||
nt|viren169: East will lead one of his aces if 6@D is reached!|pg||
mb|p|nt|jferg: basis system here for decades was 4 card suits and 12-14 nt|pg||
nt|eamongall: about 21-9 but I will check|pg||
nt|lestergold: the dim pips do not permit this bid|pg||
nt|rnc: She's still awake, yes!|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: hmm|pg||
nt|jferg: lots of 800, 1100 in 1nt x|pg||
nt|cindy: that will work i guess but dontcha like 3H better ?|pg||
nt|cindy: remember the old conv cards always use to have something called swiss on them ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this bid use to show solid diamonds before the crash|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the classical meaning of 4D was this sort of hand but with solid diamonds (or at least headed by AK). stretching the criteria here|pg||
nt|cindy: and a better hand|pg||
nt|viren169: probably general take-out|pg||
nt|mowen: west will be on lead to @Ss|pg||
nt|viren169: on their way!|pg||
nt|viren169: tough for East to find it either|pg||
nt|mowen: the 4@C splinter might cost the slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 4@D now!|pg||
nt|mowen: perhaps a make splinter in @Ds would be better|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no 350 km from that, but I have a strong voice....|pg||
nt|werge: Let´s see, whether E/W have a system allowing them to play a @D-contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: saved by the negative double:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: and spade holding not ideal in offence but great in defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: can E pass?|pg||
nt|roswolf: will east pot shot 3nt?|pg||
nt|lestergold: however let off hook|pg||
nt|lestergold: and maybe pushed opposm overboard|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cindy: not that Qx of clubs|pg||
nt|eamongall: 35-40 is 21-9|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 10 e/w got to 5@S and went -1 for 12 imps back|pg||
nt|othered1: south may not sell out|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petepunt: slam try 3n|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this auction does smell fishy|pg||
nt|werge: That´s well-known - when partner asks, why you did´nt act, you answer: As you saw, I thought about it|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep hes doen it|pg||
nt|roswolf: ouch|pg||
nt|sybarra: bummer|pg||
nt|lestergold: and no play whatsoever|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|cindy: uhoh|pg||
nt|jallerton: Welcome back!|pg||
nt|chick: serious 3N?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|paulg: probably best to lead clubs and then play on hearts|pg||
nt|paulg: but hard to see enough tricks|pg||
nt|cindy: giving some back maybe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: difficult to execute a devil's coup in a side suit|pg||
nt|jferg: looks like remargen the bridge too far!!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: nope |pg||
nt|rnc: Think about the insurance, Mike :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: don't have enough spots anyway for devil's coup|pg||
nt|viren169: East may find a diamond now as neither N/S will cue 2nd round control in @D|pg||
nt|viren169: West!|pg||
nt|mowen: if South is going on he should cue @Ds to try to stop the lead|pg||
nt|viren169: Ummmmmmm... is Zia South?|pg||
nt|mowen: no Paul Denning is a solid citizen|pg||
nt|mowen: but temptation lurks|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Denning is still thinking.....|pg||
nt|mariner1: looks like 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as always, I will take action after 1@c and not balance|pg||
nt|sybarra: defense has to do too much wrong to let it thru|pg||
nt|roswolf: SOUTH LEADS HIS PARDS SUIT = VERY WISE|pg||
nt|lestergold: no insurance i stick my neck out if this makes im going back to work|pg||
pc|s8|nt|james_h: good lead|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good lead - there is a case for as heart on this auction as well.|pg||
nt|viren169: could be let through here!|pg||
nt|viren169: need a @H switch...|pg||
nt|viren169: seems unusal not to lead a @H when it bit and supported?!?!|pg||
nt|james_h: @h comming|pg||
nt|finch: EW are the 8 of diamonds off being able to make 3NT with spades 3-3, but the diamond pips are such that 1S is an excellent spot|pg||
nt|mowen: n/s like to signal with the K@D|pg||
nt|petepunt: yes think thats the name :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: there is a squeeze position against N though so more possible|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is E is very disappointed in W hand |pg||
nt|rnc: Let's hope it fails then - so you can have your late dinner...|pg||
nt|lestergold: east forced west to do something|pg||
nt|roswolf: that would be the £100 table mike!?|pg||
nt|sybarra: often we dont see that Geoffrey |pg||
pc|h4|nt|petepunt: 2n the limit for e/w  ?|pg||
nt|viren169: Not easy as South know they are missing A of @H|pg||
nt|mowen: he should ask Espen what he intends to lead!|pg||
nt|mariner1: N just needs to pitch carefully|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|viren169: He must have seen Espen had the @D ready!|pg||
nt|mowen: perhaps he did|pg||
nt|viren169: I agree! bluff and counter bluff! |pg||
nt|mowen: so a good stop|pg||
nt|viren169: I would loved to have seen the 5@D bid!|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|viren169: I could be a Euro up or down depeneding on next trick!|pg||
nt|mowen: plenty of possible slam hands in this set|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzkp: grr, verrrry wobbly connection here, sorry again all|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i once played in a game where my pard carried me in cuch a game!|pg||
nt|lestergold: no 100 pound table in england these days|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|james_h: terry must unblock|pg||
nt|jallerton: catching up, not playing a speedball!|pg||
nt|viren169: that would make it extremely difficult for West!|pg||
pc|hT|nt|viren169: One Euro up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|paulg: the upside for declarer is that he knows that this will be the same everywhere|pg||
nt|ciaran: Now, N needs to unblock|pg||
nt|james_h: Ur up|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if W's black suit doubleton had been in spades, this lead would have blown the defense. when we tally our luck, we often take things like that for granted|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now if lavery returns club jack maybe|pg||
nt|jferg: wonder why east bid 5d went west cue bid dias|pg||
nt|mowen: mostly with limited high cards|pg||
nt|lestergold: and at my club nothing like that stake|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|nt|finch: funny it looks natural to play a heart at trick 2, but trumps would have worked better|pg||
nt|petepunt: heard 3n let thru'  in one match on @H lead|pg||
nt|finch: if the acution starts 1NT (weak) double and NS find their heart fit, you can see that might happen|pg||

nt|rednaxela: Slam test for N/S now.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another slam|pg||
nt|paulg: this was the kind of hand where the Italians would have had more faith in their signalling and taken the extra defensive trick|pg||
nt|aupillon: I understand why Wales lose. There is only ONE spectator from Wales . Tks Dykes !|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Scotland pitching a no hitter|pg||
nt|mdgraham: shameful - just like the rugby|pg||
nt|aupillon: So now, the goal is to reach 60. I begin to see the thing|pg||
nt|paulg: West comes under pressure in the black suits in 2NT, so perhaps that would make|pg||
nt|paulg: multi 2@d here|pg||
nt|paulg: but probably will not stop EW reaching 4@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW have a decent play for 6@D, but if North opens, it will be difficult|pg||

nt|toobad: 4d from south i hope|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 4NT is a nice practical shot|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Yes, Paul.  The missing Aces and the top trumps are all you are interested in.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|paulg: it also prevents 4@s clouding the auction|pg||
nt|paulg: 3@h may win the pot here|pg||
nt|paulg: harder for West to balance over 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: they would have just led the Jd|pg||
nt|aupillon: Re shuffle..|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Wales may gian on 12, though. Declarer made quite a lot of tricks in 2@S |pg||

mb|2S|nt|jcomyn: money time again?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I think they will|pg||
nt|chick: which is why S should bid something|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Yes, E-W can even afford a slam disaster here|pg||

nt|mdgraham: now double by West|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bobholl: if protecting too ?|pg||

nt|toobad: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Not to be|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: well...no slam now|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: but the turk is thinking|pg||
nt|rnc: Only question is for which side:)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: true|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT likely minors|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcomyn: lead is slipping fast|pg||
nt|toobad: excellent |pg||

mb|p|nt|dan_hohor: oh|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: here we go|pg||
nt|bjacobs: where?|pg||
nt|toobad: good shot from Mary madden there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although double is perhaps more flexible|pg||
nt|paulg: indeed ... double also allows you to play lebensohl|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: yes - 2NT is the minors|pg||
mb|4C|nt|bjacobs: 5@S is just like 4@S|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Surely South is expecting the standard defence to an Irish slam? Cash your ace, cash partner's ace, wait for the trump trick...?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Declarer will be nervouson that lead - she has no idea things are so friendly|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 14 imps in 4 boards is fairly close|pg||
nt|paulg: i think she put herself in a poor position ... you could be off three aces here|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|capercliff: if the AK@h were on the other side this would be much harder|pg||
nt|capercliff: aQsry|pg||
nt|aupillon: If she finesses the 9 of diamonds, i can even spouse her|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: closed room finished|pg||
nt|paulg: no slam then|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently not|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: nearly got there|pg||
nt|paulg: a real lack of partnership trust I feel ... the West hand is a lot better than it might be for 2NT, so why not pass 3NT|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk5: So Wein must have shown a slam invitational hand by transferring first|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Must have|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I think they play South Africvan Texas, so 4@D would have been a sign-off in spades|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: yes...for this Sehat asked|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Serhat|pg||
pc|s9|nt|odysseus69: the good- bad agreement might have allowed East to bid- and nudge into 3S possibly|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rednaxela: I think i would have felt more comfortable having enquired.|pg||
nt|paulg: of course being off 3 aces would not endorse my approach either |pg||
nt|paulg: Adamson/Martin do not play Good/bad 2NT which might have helped|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg: the lead of the @sQ asked for an attitude signal, so easy to continue|pg||

nt|fabsayc: and no side winners to discard heart losers|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes of course|pg||
nt|james_h: Terry MUST have unblocked otherwise it makes|pg||
nt|viren169: good fight back by England!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: there wasn't much more to 12. He played off his remaining trumps but the hearts remained very blocked.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: comfort break|pg||
nt|eamongall: that 13 imps translates to 3 VP in this case ...18-12 now |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: if it stays that way then England take a 6VP lead into final match|pg||
nt|eamongall: England remain 90 imps ahead of scotland |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: all back and play resuming|pg||
nt|mowen: needing miracles I gather|pg||
nt|roswolf: a small swing likely for e/w|pg||
nt|sybarra: slams!   |pg||
nt|lestergold: well the lady'stactcis worked cant argue with taht|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will be fun|pg||
nt|roswolf: east opeming 1@S WOULS PROVIDE MAX EXCITEMENT|pg||
nt|rnc: 5@S on EW and 6@H NS|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|viren169: We had some specs earlier on wondering what country EBU were...|pg||
nt|mariner1: now the penultimate board of this session|pg||
nt|lestergold: par is 6s doubled one off|pg||
nt|rnc: Not surprised if ended in 7@S X|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: puppet presumably|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think is a tossup whether east should bid|pg||
nt|viren169: probably 4@S by North now!|pg||
nt|james_h: 3/4 @d?|pg||
nt|mowen: another possible slam|pg||
nt|bobh1: think this is the ante-penultimate|pg||
nt|roswolf: bets on west's bid?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and i bet this is not played in par|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: that is a strong 12-14, not that it will matter here|pg||
nt|finch: Typical love all, strong club opening from East.|pg||
nt|bobh1: 6@s just needs 3-3 @s's|pg||
nt|rnc: or in some other contracts, of course...:)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mowen: 4@S cold for S&D|pg||
nt|viren169: Some thought it was in the EU!|pg||
nt|werge: Against 3 @H, it seems, that East has over-ruffed, where he shold´nt do it!|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jallerton: 5@c thin but playable|pg||
nt|lestergold: what does howeard's double mean?|pg||
nt|finch: 1NT response forcing|pg||
nt|mowen: and west might bid it|pg||
nt|jallerton: "up to speed" = normal slow tempo!|pg||
nt|eamongall: he is not going to get any help in clubs so 3@Ss it is|pg||
nt|eamongall: and will be one off in about 17 seconds |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: lol, commentator's curse|pg||
nt|bobh1: EW might get overextended here|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was just the bid W wanted to hear|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H has a play especially if he can ruff @S quickly|pg||
nt|rnc: Let's see|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: very hard opening lead problem|pg||
nt|marlowepi: u mean W?|pg||
nt|jallerton: take-out?|pg||
nt|ianrei: X is probably values without 3S|pg||
nt|lestergold: but only one suit left |pg||
nt|jallerton: so it shows a @d suit plus @s tolerance|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate nice splinter by west could get them to the thin but frigid club game|pg||
nt|petepunt: may struggle to 6@C now|pg||
nt|viren169: with it's own currency... know as EBU vouchers!|pg||
nt|viren169: some of you might have traded in that currency before!|pg||
nt|viren169: almost as strong as the Euro|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 6@H MUST BE A POSSIBILITY NOW|pg||
nt|lestergold: now west u must PASSSSS|pg||
nt|rnc: 5@C any?|pg||
nt|lestergold: another chance  oh......|pg||
nt|roswolf: re-open into slam - OUCH|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely west can calculate that a serious wheel has comeoff for theoppos|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|paulg: small heart, hoping you can switch back to clubs?|pg||
nt|paulg: or @cQ followed by "doh!"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: everything but a diamond is a possibility, including heart Q|pg||
nt|paulg: it is a weak notrump, so less reason for @hQ than against a strong notrump|pg||
nt|viren169: E/W pushing N/S around here!|pg||
nt|chick: excellent contract if they find it|pg||
nt|mowen: poor effort by Brunner/Holland to play 4@S with 7 on a finesse|pg||
nt|roswolf: who will win the auction / they might well regret it!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: yes, especially since we see 18 and 19 counts opening 2nt these days|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the death hand for south|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you get to pass the lead with four kings|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Playing Puppet, which allows you to announce a 5-card major, increases the odds a bit in favor of bidding with the W hand as there is more upside. but even then it is only close|pg||
nt|james_h: nothing makes|pg||
nt|sharkirl: good save when no x|pg||
nt|eamongall: if they get the bidding finished|pg||
pc|d2|nt|finch: the opening bid worked very well for EW|pg||
nt|mowen: 10 opposite 11|pg||
nt|finch: what was I saying about 11 opposite 11 = game earlier? |pg||
nt|viren169: Is 4@C splinter?|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe too many transportation issues in 4@H though|pg||
nt|werge: Have we seen any double in this set? For money...?|pg||
nt|rnc: here we go again|pg||
nt|roswolf: good bid now south must wake up|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ianrei: they need to duck a S at trick 1 to beat this|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: I think O'Gorman expected 3+ clubs opposite|pg||
nt|petepunt: 6@D will save a few imps|pg||
nt|mowen: don't know but should encourage south|pg||
nt|viren169: North will go on with those aces!|pg||
nt|roswolf: not likely i would say|pg||
nt|lestergold: double fit identified west will come to eat that 4s bid|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another way to win by bidding is that E might have a 5-card minor, e.g. AQJxx of Diamonds, and then you could easily be on a finesse for game, or even better than that|pg||
nt|ianrei: to beat 5C anyway|pg||
nt|chick: scary though, will all those losers staring at you|pg||
nt|viren169: singleton x not good... |pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: perhaps more--better chance heart king is in dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: well hard for east to egt to excited with his hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: 4@c is surprising with no @d wastage|pg||
nt|jallerton: @d lead is a good start for the defence.  What's the best line?|pg||
nt|eamongall: well its not my fault those guys did not agree their defence to Unusual NT overcalls|pg||
nt|viren169: void good...|pg||
nt|mowen: 4@S seems cowardly - why not 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: automatic 6h bid now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ianrei: I'm suprised East didn't bid it|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but he is worried about his horrible holdings in the majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: it's not your fault Cooke & Garvey couldn't bid 6@h earlier!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petepunt: seems normal with dbl fit here |pg||
nt|viren169: S wont play N for A of @C|pg||
nt|viren169: Now 6 for sure... and a small chance for 7...|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks 1 or 2 off|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In modern bidding there are mo penalty doubles on a lower level|pg||
nt|werge: What is going on - I continue @D|pg||
nt|roswolf: gremlins playing on west,s mind|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If N ruffs the 4th @d with @h10 E must overruff for -1|pg||
nt|werge: West seems confused, because declarer played the @D Jack from dummy...|pg||
nt|lestergold: double!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|paulg: true|pg||
nt|eamongall: anyway 5 tricks off this so dow ntwo|pg||
nt|eamongall: two|pg||
nt|eamongall: Garvey and cooke could have bid 6@Hs ..they just never started|pg||
nt|bobh1: desperate men do desperate things|pg||
nt|mariner1: no way they were not playing @S, just dreaming in @H here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: if that is stood it will be the ultimatwe ping pong of errors|pg||
nt|rnc: I need some stronger than coffee now|pg||
nt|lestergold: wowowowo|pg||
nt|roswolf: ouch x many|pg||
nt|lestergold: id even miss dinner for this excitement|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i prediced it would not be played in par but i could never have envisage dthis|pg||
nt|lestergold: could be massive impagte|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: especially with the spade overcall|pg||
nt|finch: interesting choice of swtich|pg||
nt|finch: ...and play from north....|pg||
pc|s9|nt|finch: but all not very interesting with the contract cold|pg||
nt|viren169: not a particularly good 7... on the odds|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|cindy: im 100% for that holding to be in dummy when i lead the Q|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oops now we could see down a lot|pg||
nt|mowen: not optimum|pg||
nt|ciaran: Club to Q now|pg||
nt|viren169: but if N has a voild @C like he has advertised... he must have K of @D!|pg||
nt|mowen: specs are saying 4@C was key card ask which explains 4@S|pg||
nt|viren169: Ah...........|pg||
nt|bobh1: 3-3 @s's or JT tight|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ciaran: This will make for 5 imps to England|pg||
nt|ianrei: Nice play by North|pg||
nt|othered1: West reasonably took his time and worked things out correctly.|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be most of the lead i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: best to draw trumps oh but there arent any to draw  sorry bad joke|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: especially if pd has the knave|pg||
nt|marlowepi: brb have to feed the parking meater|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry - East shall discard, if so - and at least 1 down|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jallerton: If N ducks, E can stop the ruff by crossing and taking a @h finesse - not necessary in 4@c|pg||
nt|ianrei: too many D forces allow 5S tricks, 2C and a H|pg||
nt|jallerton: declarer could hope to elope all 3 small trumps in hand but would need defensive help|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: 15 minutes left, 2 and a half boards to play|pg||
nt|ciaran: Yes - short entries for that|pg||
nt|jallerton: so if @h at trick 2, defence should play @h back|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petepunt: still thinking of !4S hand i suspect |pg||
nt|mowen: Denning will make this quickly|pg||
nt|lestergold: no scope for finding a way to go down|pg||
pc|h2|nt|werge: The hesitation is enough - he had 8 m inutes to think about this|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|finch: I think the @H2 at trick 1 must have been count, Cooke could see no future in a club switch if declarer had four diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: A swing here... the wrong way!|pg||
nt|othered1: This isn't a critical position for east, who will beat this by doing nothing aberrant|pg||
nt|roswolf: like the @SK now!?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ianrei: unlucky to be only worth an overtrick|pg||
nt|petepunt: may still be too many with @D break|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: a revoke!?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think there may be a wailing and gnasjing of teeth in the post mortem|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: a slam game swing thats something|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: -1 without any options i think|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|jallerton: as it is dec is play for 3-3 @s - perfectly reasonable|pg||
nt|petepunt: but k@S is right now|pg||
nt|petepunt: W must hold k@S on bidding after his pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: and E still has hopes on this one until next trick|pg||
pc|c4|nt|viren169: I'm not really taking sides!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|othered1: Tha was the only immediately losing play back, I think|pg||
nt|werge: 2 down with normal play - and a discard instead of overruff, probably loosing 1 @S, 2 @H and the 3 @D-tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|nt|mowen: England lost it in the open room|pg||
nt|petepunt: maybe not the wrong way :)|pg||
nt|viren169: Yes I agree...|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: hand on to spades north|pg||
nt|jallerton: or @C10x offside|pg||
nt|chick: I don't see any way to escape 1 more loser|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Daffyd still thinking|pg||
nt|chick: thinking is good ... when people on bbo whine about 'faster pls', I always remind them that bridge is all about thinking :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: so its about a 40% slam that is off|pg||
nt|bobh1: S should have hit it|pg||
nt|bobh1: clearly his pd had a bullet|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c9|pc|c8|pg||
pc|sT|pc|cT|pc|h4|nt|chick: lol  thanks to the 15 or so kibs who agree with me :)|pg||

nt|mdgraham: mais oui. Pas de probleme|pg||
nt|paulg: time for a revenge multi?|pg||
nt|paulg: no, apparently it's weak twos|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: benji style|pg||
mb|2S|nt|chick: 3 hands to play, 5 to compare, and tied score|pg||
nt|paulg: yes, i normally try at trick 1 to achieve that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: There is a little device there - if West had doubled 2@S for take-out, East can transfer to hearts with 3@D and then bid a natural 4@D. Not saying you would get to slam, but at ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: least you would be in game |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: and if you don't have that available you could just bid 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: no answer to that one Roland|pg||
nt|aupillon: 4 hearts ?|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk4: Maybe our operator has|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: and a nasty -300 on 28|pg||
nt|paulg: not an obvious double there ... Macdonald may well pass|pg||
mb|2N|nt|toobad: wrong score entered probably|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bjacobs: Zia would be good too - I'm sure he'd be interested|pg||
nt|paulg: double for takeout would be a nice bid here|pg||
nt|paulg: sorry, call|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: first step of a raise to 2NT, or the road to ruin...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bobholl: two 200's on 31 and 32 :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: practical|pg||
nt|capercliff: the wrong hand is getting forced|pg||
nt|paulg: 4@h denies a spade control in my methods|pg||
nt|aupillon: a diamond, for enjoying ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I was right :) Wales on the board on  12 |pg||
nt|capercliff: but even then tapping doesnt hurt as trumps are 3-2|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Nothing to the play here|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: 3nt on board 28 was not a happy resting spot, but didn't deserve that result|pg||

pc|s9|nt|Walddk5: She is only a spade finesse away from making it, but ...|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Probably not when clubs are blocked|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: comms problems even with sp finesse ok|pg||
nt|bjacobs: How about a diamond finesse?|pg||
nt|paulg: Fred said it was the right thing to do|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This would be a lot better if West had a third spade|pg||
nt|toobad: its usually a 1 or 3 hand anyway ........ 2n rarely successful|pg||

nt|lestergold: well mayeb just as well the thin maybe anorexic game wasnt bid!|pg||
nt|bobh1: when they bid 4n and not 5n they are almost always missing an A|pg||
nt|mariner1: now the real penultimate board.............|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be flat but you never know|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If he discards @hK @h to @h9 @hA clean @c and throw in on @hQ for a favour in @s|pg||
nt|othered1: This slam should be an easy push, but sometimes . . . |pg||
nt|lestergold: irony is against 6h spade lead giving ruiff sluff 7 made|pg||
nt|roswolf: wait for bd 32|pg||
nt|roswolf: board 29 is a gain for house|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: West was playing a 14-16 point 1NT at the other table, so East made a game try, his partner not accepting.|pg||
nt|jallerton: A great result for Wales in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: Another big board - 7@H is a good contract|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this c ould tell a tall tale|pg||
nt|lestergold: well e/w have excellent save in hearts against n/s spade game|pg||
nt|lestergold: doube fit territory always measn both sides can make lots of tricks|pg||
nt|ianrei: Not a happy choice of X of 4S by East in the other room|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@c = 11-13 balanced or any 17+|pg||
nt|werge: But why could´nt West - without East´s hesitation - have Q-J doubleton in trump?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|petepunt: daffydd is prounced DAVith for our transatlantic friends. :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: thanks to our deliberately anonymous operator, good work|pg||
nt|ciaran: Hard to bid in most natural systems though|pg||
nt|lestergold: disaastrous|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: A trump lead solved the problem in that suit and declarer soon had 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|jallerton: If 2@s shows specifically the red suits, that makes it easier to bid on as East|pg||
nt|viren169: Staraight forward 4@H now... not what England want to see!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|cindy: i have to bid something with N hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to the sponsors, commentators and spectators who laughed at our jokes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this double is presumably conventional|pg||
nt|jferg: no pen|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3H followed by 4D|pg||
nt|ciaran: Board was flat in 7@H in the Wales - Scotland match I believe|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to reach a thin 4@H|pg||
nt|finch: another fairly gentle game here, should be a flat board|pg||
nt|othered1: the double, not made in the open room, could complicate things for NS|pg||
nt|roswolf: will the t/o dbl keep n/s out of slam?|pg||
nt|werge: It makes North´s hand even better|pg||
mb|3D|nt|cindy: why would W pass then ?|pg||
nt|jferg: and lavery will xx to show a five card suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: operator says double is penalty|pg||
nt|ianrei: I think E should get this right anyway|pg||
nt|eamongall: hmmm silence is golden ...I have mopped the floor ..rescued the boiling over ham and made a cup of tea since my last comment |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: a bid that would not occur to me|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double should show a minor or 4M, 5m hand|pg||
nt|jferg: prefers poker|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5C now|pg||
nt|james_h: and they are on the road|pg||
nt|lestergold: now eastmust kbnow that his hand is not suitable for defending|pg||
nt|finch: this will turn into a very close match|pg||
nt|eamongall: its probably because we have loads of Irish commentators driven to silence|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: lol, you didn't miss much!|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup - iwonder what 3nt means?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: or russian roulette with FIVE chambers loaded|pg||
nt|petepunt: 2N shows good raise to 3@h :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: well at least @H are 3 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: i can deal with 2S|pg||
nt|paulg: this looks easier to play than 2@h|pg||
nt|cindy: i see 8 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes good judgement by DFenning|pg||
nt|lestergold: now is the kilkl point of the auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 ! was what?|pg||
nt|mariner1: cross ruffs coming|pg||
nt|bobh1: E probably has no way to show @d's or he might have chosen that suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Maybe it´s a help. N will think @hK is on side?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cindy: 3C would have gotten hammered, no doubt|pg||
nt|james_h: terry might show the Hq here|pg||
nt|eamongall: However I first hit this earth in Mill Hill London so my team is leading |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: isn't all that the wife's job anyway?|pg||
nt|mowen: not very interesting|pg||
nt|viren169: flat board... next... time running out for England.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ciaran: sorry - EBU - NI match was the one where 7@H was reached at both tables - well done|pg||
nt|mowen: flat board|pg||
nt|ciaran: The diamond blockage should mean this fails|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: 9 min on the clock|pg||
nt|jallerton: @h 3-3 are a good start for declarer though|pg||
nt|jallerton: should N duck the first trick if dummy plays J?|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like this new country EBU has done very well on its 1st attempt!|pg||
nt|lestergold: then no trumps played by northy would probably go off|pg||
pc|sT|nt|viren169: not a good start for defense...|pg||
nt|ianrei: 5H was going -2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well at least east /west havent found a foolish double |pg||
nt|roswolf: this may be tricky|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice bidding - i like the 3nt bid  showing a singleton @H:)|pg||
nt|othered1: NS brushed the double aside trivially.  Well bid.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|petepunt: with IRE being thumped it could be vwery interesting 2morrow, Scot back in picture now too|pg||
nt|ianrei: he cat setup 9 tricks - can't enjoy them though|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@C was @H and another suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: NOTHING TO THE PLAY|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jcomyn: prefer 5C there from S|pg||
nt|ianrei: S disappointed at dummy|pg||
nt|ianrei: was it really worth 3S ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: if this is flat then the match will be very close|pg||
nt|lestergold: ok defence will make a heart 3d and a spade but i think that may well be all|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcomyn: oh well flat board|pg||
nt|ciaran: Gives a better chance of reaching 7 on this layout alright|pg||
nt|james_h: Peter Goodman suggests 5nt to show the 2 aces and a void|pg||
nt|viren169: problem either min is best on this bidding seq...|pg||
nt|mowen: not a good result for the selectors|pg||
nt|sybarra: well....|pg||
nt|mariner1: W did not think it was @c|pg||
nt|sybarra: can certainly see why |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|cindy: next set in about 45 minutes|pg||
nt|viren169: ...probably...|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jallerton: Defenders have to be careful|pg||
nt|eamongall: I don't have one of those yet |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Cooke deep in thought|pg||
nt|viren169: Welcome to Peter Goodman...|pg||
nt|mowen: when the reserves beat the first team|pg||
nt|viren169: shhhhhhhhhhhh|pg||
nt|viren169: You cant say that!|pg||
nt|petepunt: evn all close 4 second now ?|pg||
nt|viren169: It shows what depth we have in the squad!|pg||
pc|s8|nt|paulg: we appear to be at the fastest table tonight|pg||
nt|ciaran: Lead had changed hands in this match with every board completed in the past few minutes.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|ralfwil: claim!|pg||
nt|roswolf: claim pls|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ciaran: Looks like EBU will extend their lead here|pg||
nt|eamongall: I have seen Cooke deep in thought before ...but I could not claim as I was not 100% certain I had the line |pg||
nt|viren169: Specs are asking where they can buy some of these EBU vouchers!|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ciaran: In other matches, England were 46-0 up against Scotland last time I checked|pg||
nt|chick: if he can manage to hold this to -1, will be a push, but that will take some defense lapses|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Gold now asking meaning of 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Daffyd saying he 'thought it was a good raise in hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was  good duck|pg||
nt|roswolf: 9 imps to house on 29|pg||
nt|lestergold: what about w30?|pg||
nt|rnc: Margin up to 29 again (285.3 - 257 to be exact)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: both 30 and 32 are potential huge wins for Lirarna|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that is 14-17 as is bd 32 therefore 29 imps is close|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cindy: well, striking gold|pg||
nt|viren169: now a flat board...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: other tables in this room finishing. Clock shows 12 min remaining.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ciaran: Usually don't show voids in partner's first is suit thoug, so may expect void in a minor?|pg||
nt|lestergold: odd switch|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mariner1: well they have halved the lead 99 down  to 49|pg||
nt|mariner1: 99 imp handicap was a lot.........|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ciaran: Final score for the first half of that match 57-0 I'm told.  |pg||
nt|jallerton: another 16 boards in each of these matches this afternoon|pg||
nt|ciaran: Anyone know how Wales - NI is going?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Garvey doesn't look confident of making this|pg||
nt|brolucius: It could hardly be natural, facing a one-level overcall and on a passed hand. You would need around 13 points at least for such a bid. More, probably.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: House was awarded 99 imps as handicap,,, its that type of match|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|paulg: that diamond switch concedes an additional IMP|pg||
nt|ciaran: first bid suit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: not really|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cindy: no ?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jcomyn: anyway chaps last hand coming up so well done all, especially operator. Tx Ciaran, James and wd the newcomers on Irish team. Splendid effort all round|pg||
nt|jallerton: stil 8 imps to Wales|pg||
nt|roswolf: oops|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: down 1|pg||
nt|mowen: 11 tricks and a flat board|pg||
pc|hK|pc|dQ|nt|jferg: looks like lavery and coffey maybe having a long breakfast|pg||
nt|ciaran: NI 45 - Wales 33 |pg||
nt|ianrei: C A onside was the only chance|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|viren169: N/S played well for most part... but lost it on the last few boards|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i don;t think the mathematics of the situation favor a penalty double with the E hand, but clearly the mathesonics do|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: sorry 2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|cindy: own 500 looks good to me|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cindy: down|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d8|nt|sharkirl: defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: well another ping pong but net result is imps to Lirarna|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jferg: and the x should be removed and play in 2d|pg||
pc|d7|pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: the likely 6 imps on this board should ensure the win for lirarna|pg||

nt|vugraphzmn: play wasnt exactly like that|pg||
nt|bobholl: got to wrong hand in the open room |pg||
nt|diumraid: ******  In Running Scores ******* -  LIVE from LIMERICK ********-   N-Ireland 24,  ENGLAND 16, CBAI 15, IRELAND 15, SCOTLAND 14, WALES 6|pg||
nt|james_h: for the record, Terry said NOTHING of the sort ... let that me clear|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The Scots in the other room have a good card - this is a nice result|pg||
nt|aupillon: Wales coming back. Nice for the match|pg||
nt|paulg: i think Sheila needed to win the second heart to guarantee the contract|pg||
nt|paulg: quite a complex hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Almost the end now, so time for a few words of thanks: to our excellent operator Stephen Peterkin; to Paul Porteus and Eamonn Galligan, who were instrumental in organising the ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: tournament; and to the Contract Bridge Association of Ireland (CBAI) for enabling BBO to provide this broadcast.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Also thanks to Paul Gipson (Scotland) and Mike Gold (England) for commentary. I am Mike Graham (England). Also thanks to all spectators for some useful and perceptive comments.  |pg||

mb|1S|nt|rnc: 6@C here will make a huge swing for NS team. |pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 @H always 5 in my partnerships |pg||
nt|toobad: the slam on board 24 was missed in the open room also|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulg: thanks Mike|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|vugrapha3: welcome to final set|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: welcome to Leigh Gold, Dan Hohor|pg||
nt|vugraphzmn: 2@h wasalerted but no expl|pg||
nt|james_h: agree Bob, but can it hurt with 3 card support in spades ...|pg||
nt|bobholl: in newell's too :)|pg||
nt|paulg: 3@h should really show a normal limit raise here (as she has)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H seems a tad windy|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|odysseus69: there were a lot of pointers in favour of trump - South had passed with a 6 card heart suit which suggests the possibility of 4 spades - North rated to have either 2-2-4-5 or 1-2 ...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4-6- |pg||
nt|toobad: and they made 12 tricks in hearts too, allegedly!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: not tempted with game here?|pg||
nt|aupillon: Lee =yes; Hand= not. Why not 4 ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why not indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: that 6NT is awful on this hand|pg||
nt|sharkirl: D10 lead, otherwise make|pg||
nt|aupillon: she has more points than everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: wd|pg||
nt|rnc: Missed opportunity in both rooms.|pg||
nt|sharkirl: usual contract, make on any other leag|pg||
pc|dT|nt|dan_hohor: Traian, bad news for the moment . Aus batting and they are 14 for 3 after 5 overs !|pg||
pc|d4|nt|james_h: in fact I like that bid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good case here for not leading partners suit|pg||
nt|paulg: strange auction in the other room, i wonder if they had a forcing pass, or not, misunderstanding|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lethal666: good X by south, otherwise north would definatly bid 5C or 5d|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: Aus plays South Africa in a one day game ( cricket )|pg||
nt|toobad: south holding the Ac should have guessed that any north cards are working for her|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petergill: Another diamond is best I think, but that defence is not obvious. |pg||
nt|lethal666: from norths vu point, nothing seems great, so might as well come another D|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Peter Gill is with us as well....a great aussie player|pg||
nt|odysseus69: you are right Paul- the only explanation|pg||
nt|aupillon: Tell me before finishing, which is better whiskey ? Scottish or Welsh ? Have to go to my boutique.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|nt|chick: I think it's a very normal bid, clubs were never in the running|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bobholl: would you put the J of @H now i wouldn't|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dan_hohor: one of the best bridge technicians , Sydney based |pg||
nt|james_h: oIt does not work so well when playing 4cM but North shd prob bid 4|pg||
nt|paulg: as John has pointed out, North's @dQ makes a huge difference to the hand|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|paulg: should be fairly easy for Martin to duck this ... the diamond and spade suits suggest that more than one heart is needed|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the guess at trick 1 was crucial-although this delay is making me nervous|pg||
nt|toobad: 2h is missing so she should duck|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The best whisky is Bhunnahabhain (inho)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzmn: Wbelieving j@c|pg||
pc|h2|nt|paulg: any other queen, even though helpful, would make game a poor proposition|pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulg: well done|pg||
nt|odysseus69: it looks right to play heart Q at rick 1 - prepared to lose 2 hearts if West produces the king|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: now it's just -1, 100 to NS. |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Serhat in the tank|pg||
nt|petergill: NS are not far off making 4@D, but NS did well not to reach the five level. |pg||
nt|lethal666: i predict 5 imps to Caplan|pg||
nt|odysseus69: or alternatively to duck the Jack|pg||
pc|h5|nt|paulg: so NI a little unlucky here|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jcomyn: but whyCornelia if it were H or S there would be no problem|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|d8|nt|dan_hohor: it is interesting , as one of the spectators points out, that the teams have kept the same placing during the 64 boards|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT by NS is not hopeless, if the defence plays on @H for instance. |pg||
nt|bobholl: she won't expect to win on this board but she does :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|toobad: the 5d on board 26 from NI has gained 13 imps, 3nt going off 2 in the open room|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|sJ|pc|c9|nt|toobad: not unlucky ... poor pass of 3H|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chick: exactly... as has been said, we lost the club suit about 20 years ago and the diamond suit is in danger :)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Gain for NI on board 12 where the Scottish South passed out 1NT and it made lots - NI were in 2@H|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jcomyn: I would lol only it is no longer funny|pg||
nt|chick: as a fine kib points out, there is still hope for an endplay|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: tough set of hands!|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@H rebid in open room looks strange|pg||
nt|roswolf: bad start!?|pg||
nt|lestergold: enuf to bid 6|pg||
nt|roswolf: not a good moment for 3nt here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 7 clubs is about as infrangible a s u get|pg||
nt|roswolf: as happenened in the other room|pg||
nt|rnc: I think EW is playing Sundelin-NT, then they should be able to find out that 3NT is a bad spot and 6m playable (even 7@C here)|pg||
nt|roswolf: tthe long think is worrying|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont expect them to reach it- but do not expect to play this hand in no trumps- 5 of a minor feeble 6 reasonable and 7 probably a pipe dream|pg||
nt|roswolf: he is clearly contemplating 3nt|pg||
nt|rnc: If so it'll go 2@D (relay to 2@H) and then "some way" (there are various methods here) to show at least 5-5 m and slaminvitational|pg||
mb|2D|nt|james_h: they should reach game anyway|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just worth 3D|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now West must find a raise.|pg||
nt|viren169: easy 4@H to finish of with...|pg||

nt|vugraphzkp: tonktonk|pg||
nt|eamongall: its really snowing in Waterford |pg||
nt|mcarroll: At last - a low level penalty double|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at|pg||
nt|mariner1: it!|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to you also Rob |pg||
nt|bobh1: EW reach the sterling contract of 3@d|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm this will be interesting|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i would be looking for minor game/slam opposite a no trump opener with that hand|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ciaran: 3@D is a natural slam try if I'm reading their card right|pg||
nt|james_h: 2n tx to @d|pg||
nt|ciaran: this is a transfer to @D|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and thgen?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 of a minor fr  N/S looks makeable|pg||
nt|finch: looks very hard to beat when played by the long hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: This is the last board of the set. Thank-you to Tim, our wonderful vu-graph operator in Oxford. Great concentration!|pg||
nt|mariner1: also, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates, Sharon|pg||
nt|mariner1: Osberg, and David Smith. Without them there would have been no broadcasts.|pg||
nt|mariner1: Thanks a lot for creating a site that is greatly appreciated by bridge lovers|pg||
nt|mariner1: worldwide!|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: we use the double pelvix thrust rescue system|pg||
nt|jferg: aha that one|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|bobh1: violating one of Burn's laws|pg||
nt|rnc: one step further|pg||
mb|4S|nt|marlowepi: you have to pay me royalties to use that system|pg||
nt|jferg: we use the double helvic system here|pg||
nt|jferg: this way we have 4 wriggles|pg||
nt|ianrei: tough decision for S|pg||
nt|jallerton: Thanks also to my excellent co-commentators, Ciaran and Ian|pg||
nt|ciaran: EBU have a good position here - 2H looks good for N/S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: you're welcome - hope to have better conn this afternoon|pg||
nt|othered1: north was the doubler in the other room, so perhaps south converted a takout (or cards showing) double|pg||
nt|roswolf: should play here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: PASS of course!|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2d measning?|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: Cooke and Garvey muddling the auction on not many values|pg||
nt|mowen: 2@H looks like a good raise to me|pg||
nt|petepunt: west hand improved now|pg||
nt|mowen: but what to bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: I can see the bidding but still wondering how they got there|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: 3d is min|pg||
nt|ciaran: 3@C would say Terry likes the suit|pg||
nt|ciaran: Sensible auction|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes agree|pg||
nt|brolucius: Strong club made it easier in the other room, but I expect they will still get there.|pg||
nt|james_h: yes|pg||
nt|ianrei: did well|pg||
nt|lestergold: deefending 4s even more profitable should be 2 off for 500|pg||
nt|jallerton: too balanced to bid I think, but 4@sx could eaily be cold|pg||
nt|finch: this makes as long as declarer knocks out the right ace first|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3n need right ace knocked out first|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm  - Burn's Laws|pg||
nt|sybarra: may think he can squeak home with 7 tricks but |pg||
nt|rnc: Pupp to 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: 5@d may get out for 300, definitely 500, so a good save|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i'm not sure about that 3D overcall. might work well, but i would be nervous that it might push N into a phantom save|pg||
nt|cindy: so ending with a push    thx everyone    see you back in 40 minutes|pg||
nt|viren169: East will push here|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's 2@S will take the game-try string out of 3@H by East. |pg||
nt|brolucius: ..sting..|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5@c is touch-and-go on a spade lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: selway plays too fast|pg||
nt|roswolf: puppet to 2@H|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cindy: turns out 5D would be good save|pg||
nt|james_h: yes, those Queens in south are not attractive|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sharkirl: maybe not so easy now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Quite rightly, Holland prefers to show his very strong hand with a double instead.|pg||
nt|finch: Garvey might lead a club after that auction with West sounding so confident|pg||
nt|ciaran: Thanks Tim|pg||
pc|hK|nt|viren169: Yes... I like dble here|pg||
nt|james_h: well done|pg||
nt|sharkirl: well bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@H now the master bid from West. She has found it!|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm not likely with that flat load of grabage in Denning's hand|pg||
nt|ianrei: S took out to 5C at the other table|pg||
nt|mowen: likely to play @Hs first|pg||
nt|petepunt: will duck 1st rounnd of @S|pg||
nt|petepunt: but wants to lead @H  to J pref so is tougher than looks|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like this should be 1 off for a few IMPs to Ireland|pg||
nt|james_h: you get the feeling that NS have their tails up going for all the part scores with gusto|pg||
nt|othered1: This should be a few more imps to Lirarna, since north doesn't have much play for this|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: needs to play club now wasnt obvious|pg||
nt|jallerton: no E didn't raise to 4@s in the other room|pg||
pc|s4|nt|paulg: 3@d is pretty pure, perhaps too much so, so if partner sacrifices I don't think he could complain|pg||
nt|petepunt: however if N has Kc and AH sing he is off so @H to k is right|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they must win this match now whatever happens here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jferg: good night all nice working with you|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@S is a good spot for N/S|pg||
nt|lestergold: so one trick down the swanee|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Everyone did well in the auction.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|james_h: Pat can be an annoying opponent|pg||
nt|viren169: and East only has red cards in his box! |pg||
nt|jallerton: Next session starts at 12.25GMT, 18 minutes from now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|viren169: ...only...|pg||
nt|bobh1: now a @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: plan B,  lead a @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe the Pareto Principle holds :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Pareto's Principle  -   States that for many phenomena 80% of consequences|pg||
nt|mariner1: stem from 20% of the causes.|pg||
nt|mariner1: W had to bid @D holding @c........ and so on.........|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ianrei: both red aces allow -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh a n input error|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|viren169: all fun and games here in the last few hands!|pg||
nt|viren169: thks to all those specs with helpful suggestions (and the Euro provider of course!)|pg||
nt|james_h: Pat loves 5431|pg||
nt|rnc: 3@H showing SPL @H (normally with 54/45 in m and 3c @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks to be a win by 5+ imps|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petepunt: still work 2do  but should make now|pg||
nt|finch: interesting, if NS both duck smoothly, declarer could choose to switch to playing on diamonds|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: no he did cash ace of hearts |pg||
nt|petepunt: was a strange pass with a good 12 by TT. ?|pg||
nt|bobh1: bravo|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: unfortunate|pg||
nt|lestergold: a fitting finale here reversed the defi8cit and rubbed it in with an excellent bidding sequence to reach the slam|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: roof caving in|pg||
nt|marlowepi: same all around|pg||
nt|othered1: west may be endplayable, if north reads the position|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup + good entertainment|pg||
nt|roswolf: thanls to all the players for that|pg||
nt|roswolf: thanks|pg||
pc|d7|nt|james_h: and claim time|pg||

nt|lestergold: well i enjoyed this spectacle very much i hope all you specs have enjoyed the showm it was a good one!|pg||
nt|rnc: It has been really thrilling and nervous|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|james_h: an imp stolen in the other room|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: or not|pg||
nt|mariner1: this maybe an exercise of Fyffe's Axiom though|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ciaran: If he sneaks a spade past the A will take 13 since there will be a show-up squeeze, but i think Erichsen would pop now|pg||
nt|viren169: Holland cashing out...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|viren169: he knows pd doesnt have too much...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: well, i don;t think that's clear. N might save on some hands with only 3 diamonds, and then we might have 2 tricks in diamonds alone, which is two more than the norm for a weak JO ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors|pg||
nt|finch: decalrer must feel in a lot of trouble, but he can't really go off with South having everything|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
nt|cindy: no no   not saying they should save|pg||
pc|d4|nt|paulg: thanks all|pg||
nt|cindy: byeee|pg||
nt|finch: oops.... all Cooke has to do is win and play another club|pg||
nt|finch: looks like West didn't count his tricks properly, he's trying to get out for one off|pg||
nt|petepunt: blocking @H complicated things|pg||
nt|mowen: key moment|pg||
nt|mowen: it could be right to win and play K@D|pg||
nt|jallerton: they really are catching up now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: trump back would have sunk the ship|pg||
nt|cindy: thx all|pg||

nt|sybarra: will see you when I can |pg||
nt|mariner1: Fyffe's Axiom : The problem-solving process will always break down at the point|pg||
nt|mariner1: at which it is possible to determine who caused the problem.|pg||

pc|cA|nt|viren169: Good bidding by all on this hand|pg||

nt|paulg: The second half starts at 1210 UK, 1310 Paris, 0710 New York and 1210 Berwick-upon-Tweed.|pg||
