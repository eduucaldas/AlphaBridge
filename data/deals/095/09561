nt|super nova: might be able to make 6h.. but in practice I would never get there.|pg||
nt|benjent: 6 red anyone? Not great contracts, and hard to agree a suit confidently enough to bid a slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|athene: you can make 7@H as the cards lie, but no-one is getting there :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira:  the directors are very busy running the ANZAC congress at the VBA ... but they promissed to update results|pg||

nt|benjent: Partscore battle here - 2@h for NS, 3@c for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: another part score mash|pg||
nt|benjent: Good result for Pennant in the other room; looks a little soft to me to let 2@h play|pg||
nt|mariner1: an agressive W might not score here|pg||
nt|mariner1: though 3@C has play|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2D|an|single suited major|nt|mariner1: so maybe it is a hand to be aggressive on..... easy to say, hard to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: west might have to double 2@H for t/o|pg||
nt|athene: but he certainly should with such a perfect hand|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|benjent: I think 2@d shows not just a major single-suiter, but also good values, like 15+|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you can't pass 2@H there i don't think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: certainly it's easier if it goes 1NT (2@H) P P round to you|pg||
nt|athene: here you don't know for sure north's suit is hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: anyone for not opening 1N with W?|pg||
nt|athene: but it's so likely, and so likely you want to compete, it's a clear pre-balance situation i think|pg||
pc|sK|nt|benjent: East could have X'd 2@d to show ... something or other; perhaps that turned West off|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mariner1: it a very nice 17+|pg||

nt|athene: well, always nice to bid and make game after opps open a strong NT|pg||
mb|1D|nt|super nova: This could be first blood to the butler team if they can hold it to 4.|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mariner1: sort of a lucky 4@S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes they are lucky no diamond ruff, no @SJ scoring, no bad trump break |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: they do have to bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Philosophical debate about the response by East - 1@d or 1@s?|pg||
nt|super nova: I would have considered 3s with Wein hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mariner1: @D was my call here|pg||
nt|athene: a lot depends on how likely 2@S is to be only 3 spades|pg||
pc|h7|nt|benjent: I would have splintered with the West hand|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|athene: if you raise with 3-card support you stop partner making some aggressive game-tries and you miss some games|pg||
pc|sT|nt|super nova: Diamond splinter would have been good if they played that from ozenir.|pg||
nt|mariner1: splinter works :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|benjent: I prefer to bid 1@d with such dud spades; you always feel nervous when partner raises 1@s to 2@s|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|athene: certainly after 1@C 1@D; 1@S you might be happier raising to 3@S with known 44 fit|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|super nova: I guess if your partner responds 1d,..then you are not going to want to upgrade your hand much with West.|pg||
nt|benjent: It feels so much better to go 1@c-1@d 1@s-3@s 4@s|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|super nova: yes certainly a good auction.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mariner1: well its easier for p to evaluate his hand if @D then @S raise shows a better hand|pg||
mc|10|nt|super nova: Butler team kicks off, the first goal.|pg||
pg||
qx|o5|st||md|3SQ652HT832D4CQ853,S83HQJ6DKQT763CT7,SAJT74HK974D82CA2,SK9HA5DAJ95CKJ964|sv|n|nt|mariner1: of course so many play gimics with 2nd level minors its sometimes hard to|pg||
nt|mariner1: adjust to a lot of hands|pg||
nt|dburn: better? 4@s is an awful contract, but...|pg||
nt|benjent: that's the old Walsh thing - you only respond 1@d with a 4 card major if you have a good hand; very playable and in fact Simon Hinge plays it with his regular partner Cathy Chua|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: well done to get to 3nt here |pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: in the teeth of spade raises|pg||
nt|mariner1: well making 3N here was good|pg||
mb|3S|an| |mb|p|nt|athene: west might double and east might bid 3nt, with the accent heavily on the "might"|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed it was|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: some people use a "thrump double" for some of these situations|pg||
nt|athene: the verb "to thrump" means to bid 3NT|pg||
pc|c4|nt|benjent: I prefer 1NT with the East hand - that @c suit doesn't cut it for me as a 2-level overcall|pg||
nt|athene: so a thrump double is a double in these very crowded 3major auctions|pg||
nt|athene: saying "partner, maybe we have 3nt on?!?"|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know how the exponents of this method know a) when to use it or b) when to bid 3nt over it|pg||
nt|benjent: Just to rub it in, it looks like 3@s will make now|pg||
nt|super nova: 1nt over call also has the added advatage of getting across your strength and 'almost' shape|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|mariner1: we call that the "do something wise double" :)|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|benjent: I used to play that sort of thing with Bob Gallus, stalwart of Victorian bridge|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: my guess is, a 1NT overcall from east is how E-W got to 3NT|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: in the other room|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|mariner1: Rabbi's do well here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|an|transfer|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|benjent: I'm going to speculate that West showed hearts, then led @cJ. East maybe hopped the A to switch a @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: South, with 10 tricks pretty locked up, grabbed the @hA and laid the @sA on the table as quickly as he could. Bingo!|pg||
nt|athene: Ozenir is bidding quite conservatively|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: not doubling 2@H on the 1nt opener..not doubling 3@S last hand|pg||
nt|athene: not acting over 1nt here|pg||
nt|benjent: Good point Bill. Even with a passed partner, and at unfavourable, I think you have to act with the West hand over a weak 1NT|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|dburn: not absurd to cash the ace of spades anyway|pg||

nt|benjent: This looks like the first imp to Pennant, but they have a nice 500 waiting to be scored up from the first board at this table|pg||
nt|loganrun: In some places - not as common as it was - many more play standard now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: a Moysian major game has play here|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|benjent: Could easily land in 3NT cold off making|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: @S is the Moysian|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: if you are going to play 3nt, you better make east declarer|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|mariner1: well can S lead a @c vs 3N in E?|pg||
nt|loganrun: 5D is a good practical spot as well|pg||
nt|athene: east will try a gentle 3@D perhaps|pg||
nt|benjent: but now they've highlighted clubs, they'll have to navigate to a sensible suit|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|benjent: Another conservative action by West - a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: now west really has to bid game surely|pg||
nt|athene: with a ten count for 2@D|pg||
nt|benjent: Chance to bid 3@s and get to Rob's Moysian|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: he can hate his points all he likes but he still has ten of them|pg||
mb|p|nt|super nova: They can also make 4h in a sub moise in hearts haha.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mariner1: and there it is :)|pg||
nt|super nova: Playing relay you get to play those good contracts sometimes ;-)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: strewth|pg||
nt|athene: good auction|pg||
nt|athene: will the defence kick off with @C @C @C?|pg||
nt|benjent: Not a bad auction and certainly effective|pg||
nt|mariner1: problem playing in W you are pretty sure to get a @c lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: oh its in E  :)|pg||
nt|dburn: no, that was a truly ridiculous autcion|pg||
nt|athene: that is what might cause trouble if spades were 4-2|pg||
nt|mariner1: David why be so ambivalent?|pg||
nt|athene: what was wrong with the auction? it looked pretty good to me|pg||
nt|mariner1: looked good to me too|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|dburn: do you play 2@d as in any way invitational?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|benjent: Superficially tempting to cash 3@h and ditch a clubs, but it's actually a major bad play|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like 4@S chances much better than resting in 4@D as in Closed Room|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|athene: no, but 3@D would be pushy|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|benjent: It would just ask to get tapped - and you would have to pitch on the 2nd round of clubs after losing a spade anyway|pg||
nt|athene: he was certainly very good for 2@D but fortunately east had just about enough to try a pushy 3@D|pg||
nt|mariner1: some folks play 2 way here...... regardless of minor opened|pg||
nt|dburn: for example, how would West have bid with @sJxx @hKQ10x @dxxx @cJxx?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|benjent: And playing to lose @sK early was good technqiue from Brad - preserve the spade in dummy in case they do pump out the clubs|pg||

nt|mariner1: used some good judgement|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: we are having a 5 minute break |pg||
nt|athene: certainly west might have been worse for 2@D, but i don't think any ridiculous action was taken|pg||

nt|benjent: A long way over for Pennant in the Closed Room ... 6@d has zero play ... but the likely suit games are probably going down also, so a cheap mistake|pg||

nt|mariner1: needs to play @S right for   9|pg||
pc|s3|nt|benjent: North bid 2@s, despite his spade stoppers, to get the idea of his 5th @h across|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|mariner1: 4 either major here|pg||
nt|benjent: 8, where NS here went for 300 in 5@hX is back to 6@d down 2 - 5 imps to Pennant|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|benjent: 9, where NS have a lucky @h slam, only made 4 in the other room - 2 imps to Butler|pg||
nt|super nova: Interesting that they didnt find the X|pg||
nt|benjent: 10, where we speculated that the real 1NT making 3 was, was in fact that and 1 imp to Pennant|pg||
mb|2D|an|intermediate|mb|d|nt|super nova: 2d should be intermediate here|pg||
nt|super nova: opening hand with about 12-15 points and a 6 card suit.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|benjent: Do you mean as a life choice, or because you know Leigh?|pg||
nt|super nova: because I know leigh|pg||
mb|p|nt|super nova: I asked him for a quick system summary|pg||
mb|3H|nt|super nova: He said he was playing comic NT|pg||
nt|super nova: so a weak 2 would be 1nt overcall.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if north had raised to 3@D, i wonder how things would have progressed?|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose east might just bid 4@S|pg||
nt|benjent: I'd like to see some comic 1NT action - always potential for a bit of fun|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: no-one seems to play that these days|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|super nova: Yes it is good convention.|pg||

nt|mariner1: which black card does S lead,  if on lead?|pg||
nt|mariner1: N could care less what he might lead|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: west might start thinking about 6@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: The @c2 and hope to sucker them into the late @c finesse in slam :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: admittedly he might just think "i wonder if 6@D is making" as he bids 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well I see 11..... is there 12 in NT?|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: @HQ falls, so 3 hearts, 2 spades (finesse), 4 diamonds (lead to @DJ), 3 clubs|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: Brad might have tried 3NT with his half @c stopper; maybe he felt he was too good|pg||
nt|athene: actually the clubs are worth 4 tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: but you have to lose a diamond anyway|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is too good for a Roland special :)|pg||

nt|super nova: .David Anderson & George Smolanko |pg||
nt|super nova: They has some other really good pairs that didnt make it.|pg||
nt|super nova: Haffer was in the Qualifying, Gue.|pg||
nt|benjent: Not a bad SA team - potential finalist|pg||
nt|super nova: Yes. even so which ever vic team gets up will have some chances of a final.|pg||
nt|super nova: However the NSW teams is likly to be waiting for whoever makes it and will be extremely strong favorites.|pg||
nt|super nova: Peake Dyke|pg||
nt|super nova: Neill Hughes|pg||
nt|super nova: Gumby and Lazer|pg||
nt|athene: ducking the @D10 might indeed have been a huge result for E-W|pg||
nt|benjent: That could be an Australian team, so they'll be the favourites|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: The restart is scheduled for 1:15 |pg||
nt|vugrapha2: so in about 45mins |pg||
nt|athene: south doesn't want to lose to east's @DQ since he might then lose four hearts (just give west the @H9)|pg||
nt|super nova: ACT have an interesting team:|pg||
nt|super nova: Brightling Lilley|pg||
nt|super nova: Kokan and smart|pg||
nt|super nova: Stephen fisher and marianne bookallil|pg||
nt|benjent: doesn't want to lose to East's @dQ fourth ... interesting question about what's more likely|pg||
nt|athene: exactly|pg||
nt|athene: i think if the @D10 holds, he might well cross to @CK, cash @SA, and finesse again|pg||
nt|athene: which would be sort of tragi-comical|pg||
nt|benjent: @dQxxx East and @hHJ9x with West, or @dQxxx West ... in which case crossing to the @cK, cashing @sA and playing another @d could easily be off|pg||
nt|athene: if west does have four diamonds then that's more chance for east to have the hearts|pg||
nt|athene: on vacant places|pg||
nt|benjent: but now the defence only needs 3 @h tricks - because South has established the @sK for them|pg||
nt|super nova: The scores could be tied at the end of the next two boards if they only go 2 down in vulnerable 3nt :-S|pg||
nt|athene: plus you have the fact that when the @D10 holds, east is simply far more likely to hae @DQxxx than west|pg||
nt|benjent: Unless West is David ...|pg||
nt|athene: yes but if the @HJ is onside, they are only getting 2 heart tricks for sure|pg||
nt|athene: maybe declarer shouldn't repeat the finesse if it holds|pg||
nt|benjent: Honestly, I think it's a pretty simple duck as West looking at @dQxxx - you must be keen to reduce communication and (probably) don't have anything urgent to play|pg||
nt|athene: but it would certainly not be a huge blunder to do so|pg||
nt|benjent: well, well. Michael Dilks got out for 1 off in 3NT on board 15 and Pennant picks up 9|pg||
nt|athene: well, yes, west might well duck @DQxxx a lot of the time, but however much less than 100% of the time he does it makes it more likely that repeating the finesse is right and ...|pg||
nt|athene: necessary|pg||
nt|benjent: Well, no, I don't agree. The required layout to shoot you if the diamonds are offside is much more likely than the required layout to shoot you if the @dQxxx is onside ... and you ...|pg||
nt|benjent: don't play for it|pg||
nt|benjent: Board 16 looks like a flattish partscore, so it looks like this set will end up flattish|pg||
nt|athene: because of the need for opps to cash a fourth (not just a third) heart?|pg||
nt|benjent: yep, that's it|pg||
nt|athene: yes, you might be right - i just don't want to lose west's brilliancy :(|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe West should duck the queen of diamonds any time he holds it, unless he does not hold some other diamond|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: right im closing the room now |pg||
nt|benjent: Good point David - in teams - the overtrick is cheap, the upside is huge - and it is certainly reasonable to play for the @dQ onside, so some will do it sometimes|pg||
nt|athene: certainly if west is going to start ducking @DQxx and @DQx then your odds for refusing the repeat of the finesse go up|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: we start again in 35 mins @@ 1.15|pg||
nt|benjent: big result for Butler on the last board - 12 imps in|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: See you all back here very soon :) |pg||

mb|1D|nt|benjent: This playoff selects the Victorian Open team to play in the Interstate Teams Championship, to be held in Canberra in July|pg||
nt|mariner1: part score battle here|pg||
nt|super nova: I think Gold is playing acol and is perhaps planning on rebidding 1nt|pg||
mb|1S|nt|benjent: We have Pennant: Wein-Ozenir, Dilks Morgan Blakeman Hinge|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Ozenir originally from Turkey but moved to Australia 5 years ago|pg||
nt|benjent: And Butler: Gold-Hollands, Beale-Smart (perennial members of the Aussie women's team), Hohor-Chira|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.vba.asn.au/   - site|pg||
mb|2N|an| |mb|p|nt|Walddk2: We have an invisible closed room up, so with some luck we will get comparisons when we roll over to board 1|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N showing a max NT here? or?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: an 18-19 balanced would likely have bid 3, so yes, 16-17 I assume|pg||
nt|benjent: I suspect were headed for 3NT down a few here|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: well, from south's hand, it looks like a 2NT bid :) but these days partner will usually think 2NT in competition means something else|pg||
nt|loganrun: Probably 1 off on a spade lead - tough for north QJ diamond fillers but knows it is tight|pg||
nt|benjent: Serhat may not be keen on leading a spade, potentially giving away the 9th trick|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|benjent: The heart lead hits a nice holding in Brad's hand, a nice layout, and should lead to 2 off|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: west was lucky, i think...there are many layouts where the lack of spade lead gives the game|pg||
nt|super nova: I wonder if he is thinking about running the QC|pg||
nt|mariner1: can he try a Chinese finesse? Q@C around?|pg||
nt|super nova: In whatsons play of the hand it is called the finesse to eliminate a guess.|pg||
nt|benjent: The best direct play for contract now is to cash the @dQ then lead @cQ - try to pin @cJ in Serhat's hand|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: club to @C10 will work very badly assuming east doesn't cover the @CQ next time|pg||
nt|athene: well, the defence can run the majors now anyway|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|loganrun: I tend to agree Bill - if that is declarer's ninth trick then it may be tough to beat anyway and you must guess the right lead|pg||

nt|mariner1: not that he had a lot of steel to ride on anyway|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|benjent: Whereas @c to the 10 only has any hope if East has a @s honour, and West has the @hA ... not super likely|pg||

nt|athene: 3nt made, just wrong side :)|pg||
mc|4|nt|super nova: Well I dont think Pennant team is going to have too much difficulty matching that score|pg||
nt|benjent: An alternative might have been to overtake the 2nd round of diamonds, playing for the diamonds to be cashing and hoping to pressure the defence into an error|pg||

nt|super nova: of the outcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: action possible here|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|benjent: Bit of a nervous start; Michael Courtenay always used to say that conceding a big penalty on the 1st board was "good"|pg||
mb|d|nt|benjent: Lulled the opponents into a false sense of security|pg||
nt|athene: oh right :)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|mariner1: some of us like to lulled :)|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps that's a philosophy he quickly invented to explain his -800 to an irate partner|pg||
mb|d|nt|loganrun: That is okay Ben as long as partner understood the theory as well|pg||
nt|benjent: I'm going to predict Butler by about 10 imps, coming from behind on the last set|pg||
nt|athene: "all part of my long-term match strategy, partner"|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: Michael plays/played a lot of rubber bridge. He calculated once that he made, on average, about a buck fifty per hand|pg||
nt|benjent: Example in positivity from Michael on going for 1700: "that's a tough way to make a buck fifty"|pg||
nt|super nova: QC or 7H?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|mariner1: if you go for 1700 and win a buck fifty RAISE THE STAKES! :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|super nova: likly to be one off.|pg||
