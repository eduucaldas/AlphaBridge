nt|panja: South must avoid a Club lead..|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|s3|pc|d3|pg||
nt|garnetts: The defence should stay with @D but they nearly always switch|pg||
nt|garnetts: I cannot see any point is cashing the A@C |pg||
nt|fifee: dummy reversal the easiest line from here. sluffing the @S9 and ruffing a @S to establish the suit|pg||

nt|baldfriede: 9@d makes the day.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: sure :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: a break from the monotony of 3n|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Jon Sveindal from Norway|pg||
nt|panja: well, I should think that without @SA with West......there is simply not 3@S bid|pg||
nt|olson: E needs to count to 4 winners  to  beat the hand  and he knows  they are not getting a club  |pg||
nt|garnetts: looks a bit like 2@S all pass to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a thin 4s looking like it shouild make if they bid it|pg||

nt|panja: this is another interesting hand..NS are missing 3 Aces..|pg||

nt|wwalter: good was not in red :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: Hi, Jon :)|pg||
nt|panja: 26 HCP..they will just about make 3Nt because SQ is in|pg||
nt|kaapo: Tosin nyt taitaa olla paljon tikkej|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kaapo: ä|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: eventual overbid by West or East may be dangerous ... slam may be tried by partner than|pg||
mb|2N|nt|santyclz: But if they bid 3nt it's unlikely to be monotonous.|pg||
nt|lestergold: lose 2h and a dim |pg||
nt|lestergold: true!|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: 16 seems ok for a srtong 1 @c?|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the spade fit land dim singleton with east makes this and an unlikely candidate for 3n|pg||
nt|danilo1: as it is happening ... East will probably try slam now|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is the drawback of the multi--North should double now I think--partner is marked with spade length|pg||
nt|garnetts: IF west started with 2@S I doubt North would bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: South must deceide between pass and 4@H|pg||
nt|garnetts: Pass looks a better bet as it is almost certain to go plus|pg||
nt|fifee: or 3NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|panja: 4 tricks in @H, 3 in some minor, two in @S...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this can be -1   |pg||
nt|panja: of course he could steal one more in other minor..|pg||
nt|fifee: likely to be some ruffing at a suit contract|pg||
nt|kippari: tässä luulisi silti riittävän|pg||
nt|maribelxx: virolaisilla on omansa, siellä merikotka jo pesii http://www.looduskalender.ee/en/node/2909|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: quickly or slowly |pg||
nt|wwalter: thay play prec, so under 15|pg||
nt|jbgood: som spade contract coming up? 4 is good - but the club split and the spade loser makes it very difficult|pg||
nt|garnetts: He will probably place his partner with four hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: well, ad only 1 more Hcp (@CA instead K) and ... lay down (could be even 7)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: the hand has tlo be managed competently to ensure ten winners|pg||
nt|santyclz: I hate to lead the suit of a splinter, but everything else looks worse here.|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ristit vähän vinossa|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: with ace of dims onside that should not prove to be too much of a problem|pg||

nt|kippari: kuinka eka päättyi|pg||
nt|kaapo: Noin 70 - 50 taisivat olla loppunumerot kotijoukkueelle|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kaapo: Hmm, olikohan se 16 vai 20 jakoa|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzkv: little discust on table :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h makes 5d safe even 6d may make|pg||
nt|danilo1: 6@C for NS ... may be foud since West will probably produce some oppening including @H (weak or two-suiter)|pg||
nt|kippari: kuka voittaa tarjoussarjan tässä|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: W might enter the bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: think I might open that N hand with 1 @H |pg||
nt|tweety1: 4 makable|pg||
nt|lestergold: not that 6d is a good contract!|pg||
mb|2N|nt|danilo1: opps ...srry, @S ruff|pg||
nt|jbgood: this time 3 nt may make if they get there on the scattered values|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S will be a good spot here....|pg||
nt|panja: depends on @C guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|baldfriede: Goddess beware; definitely not a good idea to go for 6@d.|pg||
nt|lestergold: probbaly well settle in 4h|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Or he may try 3nt.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6d we can see veryhazardous even ith favourable lie of red suit honours|pg||
nt|tweety1: 3 @s seems ok|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@D alerted is?|pg||
nt|danilo1: tr. @H, thanks|pg||
nt|wwalter: 4@c-4@d|pg||
nt|jbgood: the vulnerability may induce them to get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: and after pd's 1 @S 2 @C?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Boian Halachev from Bulgaria|pg||
nt|ppilot: hi all|pg||
nt|wwalter: hi Boian|pg||
nt|danilo1: I thk South should produce one more bid - probably 3@H, partner's 3@C was free bid|pg||
nt|ppilot: if peichev bids will drive them to vulnerable game:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: Good morning Boian|pg||
nt|kaapo: Avaus 2@C olisi molemmat ylävärit|pg||
mb|d|nt|ppilot: good desision|pg||
nt|wwalter: this is better than 6@c , down :)|pg||
nt|panja: they need to find out @D weakness though, and typically, methods tell you only about Major controls|pg||
nt|garnetts: Normally that would show Dummy's first bid suit--and a decent hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: so that N can describe his hand better|pg||
nt|jbgood: I wonder if 2 NT would be forcing?|pg||
nt|olson: will depend on lead|pg||
nt|panja: not enough HCP for Nt, and @D suit open...still bidding does not seem out of the world...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hm is this a serious stop?|pg||
nt|lestergold: a horrible contract|pg||
nt|jbgood: I guess there is only 9 tricks in spades as well|pg||
nt|olson: chance for a pickup  now|pg||
nt|panja: and now...where should @CQ be placed..|pg||
nt|kaapo: Joten Mirme joutuu avaamaan 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: communications dire apart from the pade weakness|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade weakness|pg||
nt|tweety1: with AJ in @s, S chose to bid 3nt which is not a bad option.|pg||
nt|ppilot: anyway at the other table they might bid 5 he sacriface so win 2 imps:)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: nothing wrong with souths bid- everything wrong with north's accdeptance|pg||
nt|danilo1: Guess they would not try 6@C ... West's bid over Dble is probably @S shorth|pg||
nt|panja: % is for E to have it..|pg||
pc|cA|nt|olson: declarer should play club K  since  the 4/1 split onside can be picked  up  |pg||
nt|panja: you assume he has 4 @D at most..|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: or then 1 nt?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: DONT would've worked better here|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kippari: onhan se kolmanneks pisin väri:)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|garnetts: Excuse me thought i was answering a private question|pg||
nt|kaapo: Jotkut saattaisivat tarjota Artun kädellä 1@H, koska tuki toiseen tarjoamattomaan yläväriin on perin kehno|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kaapo: Mutta voimaa on vähän liikaa|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|baldfriede: The @d allow somed communication, but not after playing 10.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tweety1: may raise to 4h maybe  but he might have tht that his @hs are too weak.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: and what will he do after he has enjoyed his 5 dim tricvks?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Rob Helle|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he had to stay on lead in case he needed to pick up K to 3 dims|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|d3|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Veysel|pg||

nt|rhelle: hello everyone|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi Rob|pg||
nt|rhelle: hi Jon|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: Hi, Rob :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: hi Silvia :)|pg||
nt|panja: note that the 1@D bid works as a bit of deterrent for the @D lead by defenders...|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|tweety1: agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is a very lame and wounded chicken|pg||
nt|santyclz: he's home now as long as @ss break 4-4 and the aqj of @hs are singleton.|pg||
nt|kippari: nyt taitaa tulla 9 tikkiä|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d5|nt|jbgood: now he can ruff a club and win if the spade queen is at most doubleton - provided the @d K takes a trick. No luck though|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h8|nt|mmmakela: now spades 3-3 but if not then dias a LOT better trump suit|pg||
nt|tweety1: umm|pg||

nt|panja: 4@S should make here...|pg||
nt|panja: if EW attack Clubs, they can get a Club trick but lose @D ruff..if they go for @D ruff....they will lose the Club trick|pg||
nt|kippari: Jos joku haluaa katsojista kommentoida jotain,lähetä yksityisviesti|pg||
nt|kaapo: Aha, Kauko vei Artun hertat|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: I guess a @c partial for EW here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|tweety1: 7 @d <NS|pg||
nt|rhelle: nobody can make much|pg||
nt|garnetts: This might prove hard for NS--pass  2@H or 2@S--not an easy choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 6d on the NS cards looks like a pretty good contract|pg||
nt|tweety1: which cannot be bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: being endplayed for a vulnerable game hurts - especially when you could have avoided the endplay|pg||
nt|fifee: 4@H a likely spot|pg||
nt|fifee: affter the 2@H overcall, seems easy from there|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|tweety1: EW!'s @h intervention will encourage N  for slam I believe.|pg||
nt|danilo1: dangerous Dble ... but will gain|pg||
nt|rhelle: absolutely ... and there really was no excuse|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|santyclz: 5 or 7 hand, can they diagnose it?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Difficult to bid it, and off if K@d wrongsided.|pg||
nt|ppilot: dont think they will find clubs and if find at bad level|pg||
nt|danilo1: what should be 3@C by South? |pg||
nt|ppilot: now popov as i know him will try 3 nt:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: :)|pg||
nt|ppilot: 3 diamond means pass or corect|pg||
nt|danilo1: if so agressive both, Dble is even more dangerous|pg||
nt|ppilot: limit 3 diamonds and ready for more at clubs|pg||
nt|panja: South should simply bid 4@S....and he did..good|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes--I think I prefer 2@S to 2@H  if were going to bid--in practice I would pass i think|pg||
nt|kaapo: Magicin 1@C|pg||
mb|3S|nt|garnetts: Yes--not the worse slam I have ever seen but the trump break makes things awkward--needs care in game |pg||
nt|fifee: the pre empt makes it hard to find though|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: south has heard the slam try and has 3 bullets!|pg||
nt|tweety1: 4 @d or 4@h ?|pg||
nt|ppilot: hard for popov now:)|pg||
nt|danilo1: guess so, 3@C would be also pass/corr ... thk enough to bid 3@C, after all, it is free bid|pg||
nt|wwalter: in the first 2 rounds they made 49 VP from a posible 50 :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|wwalter: this is also strange|pg||
nt|olson: ew are playing  negative free bids   2h  was not forcing  |pg||
nt|kaapo: 12-16 epätasainen käsi tai 15-17 tasainen|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@D joko 0-7 tai 12+|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: Oops.|pg||
nt|lestergold: er em|pg||
nt|lestergold: perhaps 4d wasnt forcing in south's opinionm maybe just competitive|pg||
nt|lestergold: onviouslhy north must have inbtended it as forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: It looks as if N did not communicate his hand correctly.|pg||
nt|tweety1: I didnt like 4 @d either.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 NT = end of discussion|pg||
nt|rhelle: it shouyldn't make, I think|pg||
nt|maribelxx: enpä nyt löytänyt mitään varsinaista systeemilappua Ranna Ruudusta, mutta Arvon moniste vironkieltä harjoitteleville http://www.bridge.ee/MV/Konv/priimagi.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: well, much better fit (3-2) than in first board (2-1) :)|pg||
nt|ppilot: seems popov double as weak nt meaning points so that explain all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: a little break after the board|pg||
nt|rhelle: but on this lead it will|pg||
nt|jbgood: absolutely|pg||
nt|rhelle: I guess it needed a @h lead to defeat it - impossible to find|pg||
nt|olson: W would need to double  1s  to set up a forcing sequence|pg||
nt|olson: or cue bid  |pg||
nt|panja: there is a very small window for that negative free bid to work....more useful in Prec..narrow range opening systems..|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kippari: eiköhän tässä kutonen löydy,taisi joutua väärään käteen|pg||
nt|kaapo: Kohta varmaan nähdään, osaavatko pojat ässäkyselyn|pg||
pc|s2|nt|garnetts: It does--but it would be tough enough anyway|pg||
nt|fifee: for sure|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: i must admit it does look like a competitive bid for the part score- how is south to know that it is anything other than that?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ppilot: and his partner playes as agg strong which is 5 min 4 major|pg||

nt|mmmakela: S didn't open in 3rd so a very  rare pppp|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its got a bit more interesting than rows of 3ns|pg||
nt|santyclz: Sounds as if it should be a new "law".  Gold's Law  1?|pg||
nt|lestergold: which is?|pg||
nt|tweety1: @ds like North:)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Another slam on a finesse.|pg||

nt|tweety1: i hope they will bid @ds right this time:)|pg||

nt|daman: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi all!|pg||
nt|daman: they started early on us     |pg||
nt|kippari: jaossa 1 Kalma Maastik tarjosivat 6D=9 imppiä|pg||
nt|kaapo: Joten ehkä Kauko tosiaan ei voinut kysyä ässiä|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|mmmakela: rare as nowadays|pg||
nt|santyclz: We might do some editting first.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: appears so|pg||
mb|1N|nt|fifee: 4@H makes |pg||
nt|garnetts: They will probably bid it now|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rhelle: @d 2-2, @c finesse right ... no such a great slam :)|pg||
nt|daman: most of the Bulgarians play precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: heading to 3 nt|pg||
nt|tweety1: strong club system is very common in Bulgaria I suppose.|pg||
nt|sybarra: must be a club system with that 1 @D opening |pg||
nt|mmmakela: my estimate is that 4xp with today's aggressive bidding happens maybe 1/200 deals about|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: no slam played by south due to the heart ruff|pg||
nt|ppilot: 5 clubs 4 SPADE|pg||
nt|danilo1: guess 4@S Dbled ... not probable West will get chance to mention @C|pg||
nt|jbgood: may even only be 11 tricks..|pg||
nt|daman: so they open any 11 point hand 1@D|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S might have been a reasonable spot for EW here..but the 51 break will kill it|pg||
mb|p|pc|c8|nt|tweety1: 2 KC out anyway|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, you need to ruff 2@s and 2@c ... and after 2 rounds of trumps you have only 3 trumps left|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@h is an interesting bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: so only 1 loser - but also only 11 winners:)|pg||
nt|olson: not ewnough  points  |pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|baldfriede: Yes, @h ruff will set it.|pg||
nt|lestergold: a sensible spot|pg||
nt|tweety1: good judge by N this time:)|pg||
nt|kippari: ja ylitikistä 1 lisää jaossa 2|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n was fine too but dont blame north wanting top lay in dims|pg||
nt|daman: forced to rebid his 4 bagger :)|pg||
nt|panja: y..but xxxx @H opposite @HA...and @C body working|pg||
nt|olson: declarer would also need to pick up clubs  for  4 winners  and this is  anti %  |pg||
nt|olson: since the  diamonds  are  2  losers|pg||
nt|kaapo: @C tasan joten tässä ei liene suurta jännitystä|pg||
nt|kippari: väh. 9 tikkiä näkyisi löytyvän tästäkin jaosta|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: just in case there is a hole in one of the black suits|pg||
nt|jbgood: should really be a big takeout 3 @h|pg||
nt|daman: this contract will be tough to make|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5 min won't fair but 3 nt has chance|pg||
nt|panja: y, not enough strength to bid any game..|pg||
nt|panja: @DT from JT9..I guess it promises Jack..|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|tweety1: needs to duck the 1st @s to make.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ppilot: as it can be seen luck is with the brave|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@C by South is much better bid than 3@S ... he is limited in precision, and hand is very good, esp. since 1S should be 5+|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT has 2 chances....slim and none|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ppilot: wonder how much time this will last ? no duplication at all and still many stones to be made|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mmmakela: good lead director bid, needs to duck 1st|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mmmakela: and guess hearts|pg||
nt|tweety1: and also 2-4 leads are common too.|pg||
nt|rhelle: ouch ... why didn't south introduce his @d?|pg||
nt|rhelle: clearly didn't get the meaning of 3@h|pg||
nt|jbgood: strange he didnt want to play the 9 card trump fit..|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mmmakela: not with 3-lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: welll declarer will have a high blood pressure momwent shortly when he leads a dim from dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think e will have at least a mini tank and then run the dim in any case|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kippari: ruutulähdöllä ne on syytä nopeasti ottaakin|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|lestergold: next time someone will lead their singleton holding Kx dims!!|pg||
nt|rhelle: but if North ducks 1 round of @h, he should get a fair way here|pg||
nt|daman: now return a @H and duck|pg||
nt|daman: then it is 2 down|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s6|nt|garnetts: Chance of a reverse Grovesnor Coup  here--drop the Q@H under the A@H --the grovesnor coup involves playing the Q from qJx to annoy declarer|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tweety1: @h ace must be in S to make.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Martin Garvey|pg||
nt|olson: S should  switch  to the  Jack of H   |pg||
pc|h2|nt|jbgood: if N has a 2 suiter - she would have bid the second duit directly - I think - so she must have @d also. Perhaps a redouble of 3 NT would have made it crearer to S|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, I think you're right, Jon|pg||
nt|rhelle: maybe South thought that 3@h just showed a very strong hand, and after 3@c a monster 2-suiter|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@c, sorry|pg||
nt|rhelle: which is not unreasonable|pg||
nt|rhelle: but a XX over 3NT would clear it up|pg||
nt|rhelle: now North has blocked the @d suit|pg||
nt|jbgood: is this really how the @d suit has been played? The 6?|pg||
nt|rhelle: this is not going to go well|pg||
nt|jbgood: depends on what team you are rooting for..|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes ... I am impartial, so I'm just looking from declarer's perspective|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: Danailov is thinking|pg||
nt|rhelle: and I unserstand why. Is he going to try and cut down on @c ruffs by returning a trump, or trying to get declarer trump short?|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps he thinks that N is 6-4 in the blacks (as S may think too)|pg||
nt|thegarve:  afternoon|pg||

nt|thegarve:  not playing like him though....|pg||
nt|lestergold: i heard that the victory was all due to u Martin no contribution from a beginner called robson|pg||

nt|daman: Liverpool is a small fishing village in Nova Scotia     is it the same?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: guess so, I'm no expert|pg||
nt|lestergold: camrose has got as much to do with how many poi8nts a certain overseas contingent chucks as to how well u play|pg||
nt|thegarve:  just say "calm down" to a Scouser (person from liverpool) pronounce it carmmmmmmmmmm down|pg||

nt|lestergold: maybe 3n was sounder with the weighht of high cards|pg||
nt|ppilot: only he lead beats but impossible on this biding|pg||
nt|jbgood: paying 500 when you have 600 available doesnt make you rich..|pg||
nt|mmmakela: sure did, congrats|pg||
nt|thegarve:  i'm a careful underbidder|pg||
nt|lestergold: his teammates sceetly watered down his beer|pg||
nt|daman: yeah   sure you are|pg||
nt|thegarve:  no woinder i druck so much|pg||
nt|daman: should be a normal @D partscore here|pg||
nt|lestergold: u surely didnt drink the stuff on sale at that hotel bar- at their prices|pg||
nt|mmmakela: brist of aces NS|pg||
nt|thegarve:  i played one contract in the last set opened 1@h showing spades and played there|pg||
nt|thegarve:  went on my tab so din't notice|pg||
nt|daman: are they still smoking?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: we will continuing now|pg||
nt|kaapo: Kauko passaa taas?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: i heard the food was so bad that half the players walked out of dinner and went to local curry house|pg||
nt|garnetts: Looks like 4@H again|pg||
nt|kaapo: Arttu ei|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fifee: yes|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ppilot: i will never bid 1 @H seems i have to improove my biding|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@h for NS|pg||
nt|jbgood: another lucky game hand in the reds for NS|pg||
nt|fifee: NS will enter the fray though :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fifee: or would have at the 1 level but prob not at the 2 level|pg||
nt|fifee: ah :)|pg||
nt|fifee: wd Andonov|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: People never seem to open hands like e's 1@h any more.|pg||
nt|rhelle: not 5@d - that will go down on repeated @s leads|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 nt needs accurate def|pg||
nt|thegarve:  great curry house that Jon knew|pg||
nt|fifee: 4@S x off 2 and a good sac|pg||
nt|kippari: hyvännäköinen 6D etelän kädestä,ei taida löytyä|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|tweety1: now N's @h will seduce S :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: not impossible for N/S to bid 6H |pg||
nt|danilo1: :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: right - sry|pg||
nt|rhelle: unless declarer throws a @s by cashing 3 rounds of @h first|pg||
nt|olson: this now makes  |pg||
nt|fifee: wow :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and 6H is frigid|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: tricky game :)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|lestergold: hm|pg||
nt|tweety1: S was conservative |pg||
nt|lestergold: i think south was worth 4c over his pards response|pg||
nt|ppilot: with everything ok easy 9 tricks|pg||
nt|danilo1: probable will make 9|pg||
nt|rhelle: hmmmmm ....|pg||
nt|jbgood: one forced spade ruff is enough to give defense 2 trump tricks in 5 @d - |pg||
nt|garnetts: You are kidding me :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure how South managed the double though|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tweety1: we say 'playing under the table' :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: its an absolutely throw against the wall infrangible 6H|pg||
nt|lestergold: just lose a club|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade takes care of im|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim|pg||
nt|fifee: his pd bid game :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jbgood: I am surprised E didnt bid ..|pg||
nt|thegarve:  many would not play 2@d as natural - worked well here|pg||
nt|daman: most Bulgarians play precision|pg||
nt|daman: so 2@D might always be natural|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tweety1: N wld bid 4 @d  if S bid 4 'c.|pg||
nt|danilo1: anc @C now ... maybe even 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ppilot: if they bid with like that playing later agg me will tear us into pieses:)|pg||
nt|danilo1: but guess, since 1NT ... will play safety ... @S10 from the table|pg||
nt|thegarve:  wonder why so many play strong @c?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: asm soon as north shows sign of life south will drive there- i think this was lazy bidding bu south|pg||
nt|rhelle: well, it's all academic now. I fins South 2@h bid with 9 points in partner's suits very timid|pg||
nt|kippari: jos tää lupas ruutuja ja kortteja niin ...|pg||
nt|kaapo: Onkohan NS:llä Lebensohl käytössä|pg||
nt|kaapo: Jos on niin 3@D lupaa kohtuulliset kortit ja ruutuja|pg||
nt|kaapo: Huonoilla tarjottaisiin ensin 2NT|pg||
nt|kippari: piti tarjota 6Nt|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mmmakela: 3 spades makes w right guesses|pg||
nt|sybarra: that seems a bit too good for 2 @C doesnt it?|pg||
nt|ppilot: nothing dangerous so will make lot of trick 1 im is 1 imp why miss it:)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|thegarve:  in Bulgaria you could call it "natural" as so many play strong @c|pg||
nt|mmmakela: why not, good sys playing teams|pg||
nt|thegarve:  they usually play the cards well|pg||
nt|panja: difficult to attribute fault to that lead..|pg||
pc|s5|nt|olson: NS had 4 winners  on a non diamond lead  but the  lead  was somewhat normal  with 2 aces|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mmmakela: yes if 15 upper limit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tweety1: two Qs damages the beauty of the hand:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think he showed at least 18-19 of his points.|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: e/wcarding what would east have played if he had held qH?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mmmakela: but 6-4|pg||
nt|rhelle: and I don't understand the @dK either|pg||
nt|fifee: now down 2|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think the play was poor as South is surely marked with the A@H |pg||
nt|garnetts: matched the bid of 6@H :)  |pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mmmakela: same card I suppose|pg||
pc|h9|nt|olson: E was  very happy to know  the  opps  play  Rusinow leads   when the  Q  was led|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ppilot: seems steliana made 10 tricks at hearts as i thought and ilko lost only 1 imp for biding missunderstanding|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tweety1: what is your suggestion for opening pls Markku?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c9|pg||
pc|d5|nt|olson: maybe  south will duck the dia  lead  towards the  J  to give a guess|pg||
nt|panja: I need to logoff now, thx Jeff, all, bye|pg||
pc|s7|pc|dQ|nt|danilo1: finaly @C ... thk lot of times before schould be played|pg||
nt|olson: good play  |pg||
nt|olson: once  S  knows  E  is  1h and 2c   this is safe to duck  |pg||
nt|olson: as  E  is marked  6142  pattern |pg||
nt|olson: to the  10  and the  J  North  shows  out|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jbgood: but of course not bidding on the E hand turned out very good|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|mmmakela: now S "knows" E has dias A|pg||
