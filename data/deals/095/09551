nt|ahollan1: we have same 4 players as last set -- but EW have switched seats|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: maybe NPC Ish can explain the strategy :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: sorry Ish is going to commentate at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=11-14  but 4@H/@S only if 11-12|pg||
nt|seniorspo: Bobby was asleep during lunch and Ish simply guessed what seats they wanted|pg||
mb|2D!|an|!h|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: guessing has always been my strategy too|pg||
nt|seniorspo: He will commentate throuugh me - sitting sight next to me|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i'm not just saying that because they always beat us in the Grand Nationals|pg||
nt|robinswr: looks like its on a guess for the queen of diamonds but with north passing and holding the ace of spades king of clubs queen of hearts he should guess it|pg||
nt|robinswr: manfield was slow not woolsey|pg||

nt|jbgood: good morning:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: morning Jon :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Gary, Jon|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Frank|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: actual margin is 7.5 imps - just in case it gets real close we need to remember that|pg||
mb|1D|nt|frankaus: g'day|pg||
nt|frankaus: 6@H |pg||
nt|jbgood: Hello all - a poweful start to this 3rd session|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: almost 6@H here but not quite|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: North may not have a weak-2@D available (and even if he does, 3@D is more fun)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: normal weak-2@D isn't so popular in Australia|pg||
nt|petergill: My team lost to this Del'monte Team in the Grand Final of the SNOT (Spring Nationals Open Teams) six months ago. |pg||
mb|1N|nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|athene: well, without the 3@D bid declarer might have tried for a diamond ruff in dummy as the tenth trick|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|patricck: isn't so popular is a bit of an understatement.....anyone opening a weak 2@D down here would be a rarity :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we remember it well :(|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl = Support Dbl (three @H's) 3@S weak, rest obvious|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi Peter:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Henry Christie is thinking about a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: as you might|pg||
nt|petergill: Hughes - Christie are not a regular partnership, so North (as I would) might think 4@C is natural, not a cue bid. |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I think he will remove to 5@H|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl = penalty|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: he can still hope that north has the @SJ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jbgood: pass from n would show a spade control?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|petergill: 4NT RKCB - but for clubs or hearts???|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|petergill: Depends on whether 4@C was natural or not|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: hi welcome back everyone|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jbgood: not much in the play |pg||
nt|petergill: 5@c = one KC for @h, on same wavelength, well done|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|royhughes: Welcome to the first segment of this semifinal for the Australian seniors championship|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: 4NT RKCB (1430) for @h|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: 11 tricks unless @DJ is covered - it shouldn't be|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: 12 tricks here on the spade finesse and 3-2 diamond break|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jbgood: still a di and a spade loser|pg||
nt|petergill: Henry Christie is from Perth in Western Australia - Nigel Rosendorff tells me that Henry is the best player in WA, but most of us think that Nigel is. :) |pg||
nt|sybarra: hi all |pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|sybarra: sorry to be late|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: well, a 3nt overcall would have worked well!|pg||
nt|athene: but no reason to expect anything other than a flat board|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d4|pc|c7|nt|frankaus: the  other semi has been conceeded|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kiwibridge: as I predicted :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: you have pretty good chances on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi All|pg||
pc|sA|nt|patricck: a good point, and maybe it isn't such an outlandish idea|pg||
nt|athene: if they unsportingly don't lead a diamond, you need partner to have a few tricks|pg||
nt|athene: or a bit of something|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: if you scored 480 as the leading team later on in the match, you might be a bit worried, as opps might have pushed to slam in the other room|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|petergill: Chris Hughes is from Melbourne. A few years back in our National Chris (partnered by Cathy Chua) beat my team in the semi, Balicki - Zmudzinski in the semi then gave the Italian ...|pg||
nt|petergill: World Champions a decent game in the Grand Final - he is a thoughtful expert player. |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: but there's still a way to go so i am sure it will be 4@S only in the open room|pg||

nt|royhughes: Braithwait-Haughie play a fairly standard 5-card major system|pg||
nt|mariner1: looks like only part scores here|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S 1N 2@H 2@S uncontested isn't impossible|pg||
nt|athene: but south might do a bit more than pass throughout|pg||
nt|sybarra: this 4 @H may fair better |pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: both these pair - live in different cities - |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that opening may put them off the failing slam|pg||
nt|patricck: here's an impossible bidding problem....how to reach 6@S from the North hand?  :)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|royhughes: Chan-Lusk describe their system as Acol, but also with 5-card majors|pg||
nt|patricck: well South will WANT to do more than pass, but on that auction what else can you do?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|royhughes: It would seem that NS are likely to get to 4H here|pg||
nt|athene: squirm and wriggle?|pg||
nt|jbgood: is N too strong to bid 1 NT in their methods, or ...?|pg||
nt|jbgood: also makes on the S hand with a di lead|pg||
nt|athene: Hoffman doesn't have any toy for this hand so just passes, hoping to express it later|pg||
nt|athene: which he can now do with 2nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he will feel happier now :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: conservative pass by S , even with a poor @H suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 2@S F is my choice here|pg||
nt|athene: well he takes the low road given the vulnerability|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|royhughes: With the heart queen offside, it is off 4 tricks|pg||
nt|royhughes: so long as the defence doesn't have an accident|pg||
nt|royhughes: If they start with a spade, for example, they might have to shift to their clubs|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think a diamond lead might be considered normal|pg||
nt|frankaus: klinger - sydney, Hoffman - Canberra|pg||
nt|petergill: EW play Standard, 1@d 4+ cards, unusual two openings, UDCA, lead 3/5 vs suit, first discard odd/even ref http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2009/seniors/Braithwaite_Haughie.pdf|pg||
nt|athene: now that diamonds have been raised, he might get more interested|pg||
pc|sT|nt|royhughes: The other suits look unappealing to me, but Braithwait chooses a spade|pg||
nt|athene: the internet makes certain pairings possible which would be a bit impractical otherwise, for sure|pg||
nt|frankaus: Mewman - sydney - Christie - perth|pg||
nt|athene: 4@C lead-directing against 4@S|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|frankaus: *Newman|pg||
nt|patricck: some will overcall, some will not, depends on style, but looks fairly aggressive vul vs not|pg||
nt|athene: hard to practice when your regular partner lives about four time zones away :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|frankaus: @D lead will test Chritie|pg||
nt|jbgood: good news is that @ds are 5-3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugrapha2: Brown has alerted the 3c bid, which appears to have encouraged him in his choice of a 5d bid|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry he is of course on lead against spades :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: shall we call it a "good save" ?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: or it would be hard to practice live|pg||
nt|athene: so 4@C perhaps just some sort of invitational bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: rehi|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps he wanted to show the void to direct the defence against spades even though he was on lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@C as invite seems to miss the point|pg||
nt|athene: he could have tried 4@H over 3@S perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: with the safety of diamonds if partner hasn't got a heart fit|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|royhughes: Haughie ducks the first trick, which is good|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 1 @D=hts and apparently 2 @H was sort of a michaels call |pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|c4|pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: if he had played @HA and another first and found east's @HK, he might have viewed to drop the @DK|pg||
pc|h5|nt|royhughes: It means he has more information to go on|pg||
nt|petergill: to dodge the club lead, eh Patrick? Too hard for me. I'm just an Aussie.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|royhughes: and has now cashed his sides' club tricks.  Well done|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|frankaus: no loosing lines now|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|mariner1: http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2009/seniors/|pg||
nt|athene: a trump and the @DK for the defence from here|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|vugrapha2: Yep|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: afternoon all|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|frankaus: tho this match is a semi - its vital as the winner will represent aus - irrespective if the result of the final - both finalist being "capped" as australian representatives|pg||
pc|d6|nt|royhughes: Declarer makes the normal play in trumps|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: better start with low heart|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: yes, if @HA and another, he wouldn't have an entry for the trump finesse anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maintaining the dummy entry and not risking a heart ruff|pg||

nt|royhughes: Chan opened somewhat light -- will he do so again?|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think most players would open the South hand in today's game|pg||
nt|frankaus: runner up getting 2nd choice of the trips this year - PABF or WC |pg||
nt|jbgood: hi, early morning here, Gary:) |pg||
nt|petergill: Namyats overcalls used to be fairly common in America where  (1!m)  - 4@C = strong 4@h overcall, 4@D = strong 4@S overcall - that might work|pg||
nt|athene: costly @CA|pg||
nt|athene: it can't ever be necessary to lay down the @CA, can it?|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer has a club loser in his hand, where is it going?|pg||
nt|athene: let's say he is 1-5-1-6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: precisely|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1-5-6-1 sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: It has some shape, good spots and 2 quick tricks, but it isn't enough for Chan|pg||
nt|frankaus: interested in view on this|pg||
nt|athene: you might reach 6@S here if in aggressive mood, but you will regret it this time|pg||
nt|mariner1: a Quack away from SLAM NS|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nice Sunday afternoon here Jon :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|royhughes: Lusk throws in a 4-card overcall|pg||
nt|athene: he still can't draw trumps and throw all dummy's clubs on hearts and ruff a club|pg||
mb|2N|nt|royhughes: NS have a play for four spades, but not with the trump king wrong|pg||
nt|royhughes: 3@c must be a raise of some kind|pg||
nt|jbgood: a nice sunny morning here|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Hughes didnt consider a 1561 as a possible shape on that hand|pg||
nt|ish1: Hi all|pg||
mb|3H|nt|royhughes: Chan gives a good description with a splinter raise|pg||
nt|royhughes: EW do best to let the opponents play, doubled or not|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi All from the venue|pg||
nt|royhughes: Hi David|pg||
nt|davidstern: This event is to qualify one team (2nd) to the PABF Zone 6 playoffs where Zone 7 compete as invitees and one team for the Seniors Bowl in Sao Paulo|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@C presumably a diamond raise of some sort - perhaps limit|pg||
nt|frankaus: miserable and raining in sydney|pg||
nt|petergill: Grotty 1@C opening = fairly normal in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Henry  @H@H|pg||
nt|henryb: Hello All|pg||
mb|4D|nt|davidstern: I like the 1@S overcall by North but know it isn't everybody's cup of tea|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D (a reverse) would be forcing, so 3@D is clearly a splinter|pg||
nt|mariner1: so 3@D here meant as a splinter|pg||
nt|athene: some might play 3@D = singleton, 4@D = void|pg||
nt|athene: but clearly not this NS pair|pg||
nt|petergill: NS can make 1@H and EW make plenty of @d's|pg||
nt|henryb: especially you|pg||
mb|4S|nt|davidstern: Man Overboard|pg||
nt|jbgood: what was the redouble? Transfer?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I always greet Andy Braithwaite as Andrew it always makes him smile|pg||
mb|5D|nt|royhughes: true, but 4@s has a play of sorts|pg||
nt|royhughes: if the trump king was onside|pg||
nt|patricck: slam is only a moderate propostion....as well as the trumps behaving you need to avoid an unlucky club ruff. Today the clubs behave, but the trumps don't|pg||
nt|athene: south will go on now i think|pg||
nt|frankaus: running scores both remi's at - http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=spo&E=1&R=&T=R|pg||
nt|petergill: Had North passed, I suppose East might have passed it in. |pg||
mb|5S|nt|royhughes: This is a lot of bidding by West and South, though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that's a world class scoring system Frank|pg||
nt|sybarra: moi??|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if 3@D was only forcing to 3@S, then 4@S shows some extras|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 3 NT W likely to win on a heart lead|pg||
nt|patricck: undoubtedly|pg||
nt|patricck: would have been passed in if North had passed|pg||
nt|petergill: Should make 110, the club loser going on the heart, unless declarer mispicks which finesses to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: It looks like Braithwait imagined short spades opposite|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes 4@S would then make perhaps|pg||
nt|royhughes: and Chan imagined longer spades opposite|pg||
nt|davidstern: I hate Chan's bidding his hand twice here|pg||
nt|athene: ok - good view to pass - admittedly north had lots more encouraging bids available, like 4@C|pg||
nt|athene: but even so, you need very little for slam - just give partner @SKQxxx and it can't be that bad|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: this will play very nicely for declarer with the friendly trump layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: I don't see bidding 5@s -- Chan doesn't have extra offense beyond his splinter raise|pg||
nt|davidstern: Surely 4@D showed what he had as a passed hand|pg||
nt|royhughes: He could have doubled to show the (slight) extra strength|pg||
nt|sybarra: "we" are not bashful at this table (meaning the players) |pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: With seeming two quick tricks and opps vul I would have taken a bite out of 5@D = 500|pg||
nt|royhughes: However, it is easier from here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the confusion came from neil's reraise in spades, assumed to be 5 long|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: So a swing of 800 on that decision|pg||
nt|royhughes: Haughie leads the king in case he wants to hold the lead|pg||
nt|royhughes: A good lead, I think|pg||
nt|royhughes: He may switch to a club|pg||
nt|royhughes: seeing the heart suit in the dummy|pg||
nt|frankaus: both semi winners will represent aus this year|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|jbgood: all square now after Del'Monte's team bid 7@h on  1!!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good going Richman and Gaspar|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||
nt|ish1: 5 over 5 wrong again|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|hT|pc|d7|pg||
nt|mariner1: so a quick 5 and out|pg||
nt|petergill: The 1C opening might tempt declarer to finesse @C10, but the heart finesse is about 75% chance I think|pg||
pc|s2|nt|patricck: sounds like partner has wasted cards in diamonds to not co-operate with your splinter, so why would his trumps be as good as @S KQxxx?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|davidstern: I agree it is often good to lead a knowing 'non cost' high card to decide who needs to be on lead|pg||
nt|royhughes: So Braithwait's bold 5@d bid becomes a winner|pg||
pc|s4|nt|henryb: another phantom strikes. but I feel sure Klinger bid to make|pg||

nt|athene: although the 5-level isn't to be taken too lightly when you are vulnerable|pg||
nt|athene: west looks like a 4@S bid to me, i must confess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@C leaves way too much room|pg||
nt|athene: klinger can bid 4@C now and respect his partner's decision over 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well 1@S is makeable too :)|pg||
nt|athene: if north had overcalled 1nt they might get into 3nt|pg||

pc|sK|nt|royhughes: Leading low might be the best chance to set up your suit|pg||
nt|davidstern: Buchen were the second seeds and were at times struggling to qualify|pg||
nt|royhughes: but high is safer if the idea is to keep declarer from getting an extra trick|pg||
nt|frankaus: can any body X 4@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: could Haughie pass the transfer>|pg||
nt|jbgood: west doing too much when no heart fit..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was 3@C GF?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: but this auction looks pretty reasonable|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes however overcalling 1N with kx @D could be a disaster and usually is|pg||
nt|patricck: 1NT overcall was the only possible way i could see that they might get there, but I must say that 1@S looks like a much better bid|pg||
pc|s3|nt|davidstern: Which was hard as only 2 teams of 6 were eliminiated|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's exactly 50% so worth it and 100% non @S lead?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: a more fun auction would be 2c 3s p 4s x p 5c ppp|pg||
nt|patricck: Del'monte hits the lead with a non-@D lead against 6@S|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|petergill: Andy Bratihwaite used to live in NZ and make nice and sensible bids, but has moved the Australia - whetheh this explains his 3@s call (instead of 3@D), NZedders could judge better ...|pg||
nt|petergill: than me. |pg||
nt|patricck: non @C lead i mean|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would think 4 @H also,   |pg||
pc|s5|nt|royhughes: Haughie plays to build a heart entry|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: the defence had better be careful|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugrapha2: didnt get to 6 anyway|pg||
nt|athene: @DA there might end up establishing the @D9|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jbgood: I dont think the odds are that good, that caters for the heart finesse only. Then the trump suit and the heart distribution...|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|davidstern: @CA and another will freeze South's hand|pg||
nt|royhughes: As David noted, things lie well for declarer|pg||
pc|h4|nt|henryb: the couple of boards I watched in the other room were pretty active also|pg||

nt|patricck: seems like a routine 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 18 other table in 6@S: on @H lead, draw two rounds of trumps, strip out the hearts, exit @DK - East wins the ace - even on a smooth low @D exit, easy to place both @CK and @DQ ...|pg||
nt|petergill: with East and run the @D|pg||
nt|henryb: Klinger does hold good cards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if that was the actual play, everybody tired (except maybe dummy)|pg||
nt|athene: if Hughes had just bid a sensible 4@S the first time, Klinger would surely have bid 5@C, and that's 500 if doubled and defended properly|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: It is tomorrow, in Australia|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: and even 3 3 @H so not a lot can go totally wrong here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|royhughes: at least from here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, it's tomorrow here too, but i don't think of 1am as being morning, more evening :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: many swinggy hands - makes it interesting|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 20 - might have been better to set up the side suit (@D) first, in 4@C|pg||
nt|athene: i am sure Richman-Gaspar won't stop below 4@S :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kiwibridge: another big ew hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well on a heart lead you need a fair amount of luck, but it all works for you|pg||
nt|athene: spade finesse, and not 5 hearts with the @DA|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S transfer to 1NT|pg||
mb|2S|nt|royhughes: 3NT would be a wonderful contract here|pg||
nt|athene: well west can bid 2@S if that's constructive, but east will just bid 4@S over that i guess|pg||
nt|royhughes: But 4@s is almost cold, too|pg||
nt|athene: i agree 3nt has the merit of being exactly 100% sure to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: yes, too many values not to bid it, and even though a @H lead is frightening you can't really go wrong|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops I meant 4 4 @H of course|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H now, surely|pg||
nt|patricck: absolutely|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: 3@s is probably invitational|pg||
nt|royhughes: Often pairs use the 4th suit on game-going hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, although that can get unwieldy|pg||
nt|petergill: We're not Seniors yet. |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i hate bergen|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kiwibridge: don't like 4C|pg||
nt|athene: i would want to open 1@C in third seat with the south hand|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|jbgood: 3 @c should have been forcing, right?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 5@C is not 3N|pg||
nt|athene: north shows the club fit courteously|pg||
pc|h6|nt|royhughes: ys, of course.  A quick look at their card shows me they play 4th suit game-forcing|pg||
nt|athene: if you have to go through 4th suit just to make a forcing jump rebid in your suit (or a forcing raise in partner's second suit) it can get awkward|pg||
nt|athene: i guess it might not be called a "courtesy raise" if it means you get to play it :)|pg||
nt|athene: south decided the hearts were just too likely to be a problem in 3nt, but with basically two balanced hands, this is quite a view to take|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks like a playable spot|pg||
nt|patricck: looks like 3 losers|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he could probe with something clever like 3@D or 3@H over 3@C, expressing doubt about 3nt|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes needs a defensive slip, and that will not be easy to find|pg||
nt|athene: i would have just bid 3nt over 1nt long ago and wandered off in search of food, i must admit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or 3@H|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D might be fit-showing or some sort of bergen|pg||
pc|h2|nt|royhughes: I don't see much the defenders can do.  If they lead trumps to stop the club ruff, declarer can work on hearts|pg||
nt|jbgood: he should show some club support ..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3N looks the best spot|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: actually there's no reason for declarer to get hearts right|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: older and wiser?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: south might have doubled 4@C, saving the 12th trick, but no big deal|pg||
nt|frankaus: may be able to limit def to 1@H & 1 @D|pg||
nt|mariner1:  I am with Bill... btw what's for dinner :)|pg||
nt|patricck: i'm mystified, you have a singleton @C and pard is prob short in @D, why not compete?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: xxx not great support|pg||
nt|athene: a good result for E-W; not many hcp|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|athene: the spade finesse doesn't help - a pitch from the three-card heart holding|pg||
nt|petergill: older and passier? = pass-ier|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: although you might actually need the spade finesse to come to 11 tricks - as well as @DAx somewhere of course|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugrapha2: he pulled out the 7D and almost played it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Richman has gone for 1100 on 4 for a ghastly result|pg||
nt|jbgood: would still make 10|pg||
pc|s8|nt|patricck: older and passe....eh?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|royhughes: Declarer is thinking of ducking|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer just has to set up the hearts whilst dummy has a trump to stop the club cash - or he will think he does|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|athene: Klinger would have led a small heart at trick 2 from @HAxx or @HQxx, i am sure|pg||
nt|athene: when he cashes the @HA it's only because he has them both so he can see there's no guess|pg||
pc|d4|nt|henryb: can't quite make 12 tricks even with the lead|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|patricck: you don't want to take the @S finesse either, you're already hoping that fails so that 3NT in the other room has no chance|pg||
nt|athene: yes, true|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|hT|nt|mariner1: only real chance now is Ax @D|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|mariner1: and he tries it|pg||

mb|1S|nt|athene: x, pass, 4@S from north|pg||
nt|mariner1: thanks :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: the big swings keep rolling|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: Yes -- South's diamonds will be a bit of a disappointment|pg||
nt|athene: to misquote a Marilyn Monroe line:- "those diamonds must be worth their weight in gold!"|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: ah ok|pg||
nt|frankaus: "modern" weak 2@H 8-11|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: Buchen goes into the lead on Board 20, but we think they will lose it again on board 21, exciting stuff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no harm done, but that is a good inference|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1nt by north??|pg||
nt|athene: undo, operator?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|royhughes: NS's 1NT range must be sort of low|pg||
nt|athene: well they aren't vulnerable, so north takes the low road|pg||
nt|athene: the 1nt will be from west|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: I like fairly robust 1NT overcalls|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: N: "sorry, I can't count"|pg||
nt|royhughes: Things lie quite well for declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: Bill Haughie, a regular in Aussie Senior teams, is originally from New Zealand (OK, so not all of Aus's top players come from NZ), has lived in Queensland (i.e sunny north ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Australia) for decades. Bill started his computer company perhaps 40 years ago, employing John Gosney who moved from England to work for him and whose son Paul coincidentally is ...|pg||
nt|petergill: well known in Aussie bridge circles. |pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1nt by west operator|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: well this contract will present few problems|pg||
nt|royhughes: for taking lots of tricks, I mean|pg||
nt|frankaus: multi - = less |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's hard to explain Richmans final bid of 4@S on 4 a real pairs bid|pg||
nt|petergill: A conservative 4@D. 5@D fails with @HQ offside|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@s fails if the club ruff is found|pg||
nt|patricck: harder to find the club ruff with the @CAxx on lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: might we play a quiet 2 @S?|pg||
nt|henryb: Hi Ed. from early morning to the late shift|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Dbl was a transfer to 1NT, I think|pg||
mb|p|pc|c8|nt|jbgood: not even at pairs..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no thats what I thought, a brain explosion :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 2nd chance when @SA wins?|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Henry!|pg||
nt|ish1: hearts much better here|pg||
nt|ish1: this will make easily though|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mariner1: 4@S should make here|pg||
nt|athene: one ruffing finesse coming right up|pg||
nt|patricck: Del'Monte have edged 4 imps closer with two swings of 2 imps each, the margin is now only 10 imps|pg||
nt|patricck: 9.5 imps actually i believe|pg||
nt|athene: north could pretty much plan that during the auction, if east had a sensible sort of suit quality|pg||
pc|c7|nt|patricck: yes, true|pg||
nt|othered1: Here the transfer bid may make it easier to defend. |pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Bill played here with Alan Turner, also with Diego Vettori, grandfather of NZ's current cricket captain when I first knew him|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: playing for !Q9x or @DJ9x onside|pg||
nt|athene: @DQ9x / @DJ9x|pg||
nt|athene: but with that holding west might insert the honour|pg||
nt|athene: a non-heart lead and there would be more work to do|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe not|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kiwibridge: it was Andrew Braithwaite who told me last year "there is no such contract as 2NT"|pg||
nt|jbgood: almost home now |pg||
pc|c6|nt|royhughes: It looks a bit strange, though, because declarer isn't likely to want to take a second diamond finesse|pg||
pc|d7|nt|petergill: and with Bob Scott I think too|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|mariner1: turns out best lead would have been a @S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: Neill takes an aggressive route|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|henryb: Weill done. I thought East might lead a doubleton @c here, and declarer would take 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|royhughes: plus, as you say, West might insert an honour|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and gets lucky, 4@S can be set, and 3nt will roll|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: a singleton trump isn't very appealing though|pg||
nt|mariner1: true|pg||
nt|athene: partners start to get pained after the fourth or fifth time you kill their AJxx, Jxxx, Qxx|pg||
nt|othered1: The first trick looks like a coded lead failure.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|royhughes: I think the 10 is maybe better, not that it matters a great dea|pg||
nt|royhughes: deal|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and Bruce Marr|pg||
nt|petergill: @SJ was to allow partner to overtake if he wanted to, knowing from the Trick 1 play that North had @SQ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mariner1: 10@C now?|pg||
nt|patricck: if you have pre-empted partner was probably going to get finessed though, so it would be a bit much to say never lead a singleton trump|pg||
nt|othered1: Perhaps with the J lead denying a higher honor|pg||
nt|henryb: the J is probably not coded|pg||
pc|h5|nt|frankaus: missed the game ROFL|pg||
pc|s2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: well, 3nt could have gone very badly wrong too :) but trick 1 worked out well |pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: if you need nine tricks, i guess you play diamonds|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: declarer might be disappointed now when he leads to his @CJ|pg||
nt|othered1: Playing low by west is mighty dangerous in that context.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|royhughes: 6 tricks is pretty good for EW|pg||
nt|jbgood: best defense takes it 2 down - not the best defense gives N an uptrick|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: but if you only need 8 you probably don't|pg||
nt|athene: there's a brilliant hand in Michael Courtney's "play cards with tim seres" where Seres switches to an unsupported king like this|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: he wouldnt have thought for so long if he has the q tho|pg||
nt|athene: and declarer assumes his Jxx means only one trick for the defence so doesn't take a fast pitch|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: exactly|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2 or 3?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: 3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: all depends what you are aiming for|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d2|nt|royhughes: right|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugrapha2: N: "glad I couldn't count this time"|pg||
nt|patricck: that's a very interesting point Michael, but still hard to play him to have the unsupported king :)|pg||
nt|athene: of course here the defence can't cash clubs anyway since east only has @CQx|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club duck was kind of pointless|pg||
pc|s5|nt|henryb: and costly on the actual hand|pg||
nt|henryb: although perhaps the only way to beat this is to cash all five red tricks and tap dummy with a third @h|pg||

nt|athene: west might still think a while before switching to @CKQxx - he might be worried about the actual club layout|pg||
nt|athene: and be working out if the diamonds are going to be set up for a club pitch|pg||
nt|athene: if Hoffman opens 1@S he will go down in four, i imagine|pg||
nt|athene: but that's likely to be a flat board|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but he might well switch to a small club from that holding, if he judges the defence need two tricks|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mariner1: NS need to stay low here|pg||
nt|henryb: 5@c got doubled at the other table, and declarer went for 1100|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|royhughes: right you are|pg||
nt|athene: now west can reopen with some number of something|pg||
nt|royhughes: This time I think there are 9 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: interesting view from north|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N is pretty low|pg||
nt|athene: it looks normal to do something with 5-4 majors, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|athene: it does have a lot of losers :)|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps after the double klinger will view to play 3nt from his side|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2@C is aggressive|pg||
nt|royhughes: when the club ace shows up in the East, where you don't expect it|pg||
nt|mariner1: N has a perfect garbage stayman hand|pg||
nt|frankaus: once more an exciting hand|pg||
mb|2D|nt|royhughes: aggressive unless it is for play, which is how we used to bid|pg||
nt|henryb: the auction is a treat|pg||
nt|athene: (2@C artificial or semi-artificial, so double shows clubs, rather than being for t/o)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north will certainly go to game if south bids 2nt over 2@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: heres the heavy 2C in action again|pg||
nt|petergill: Henry Christie is originally from England I think - now from Perth. He used to play a Forcing Pass System for many years.  |pg||
nt|patricck: 6@H can make here, but very unlikely to bid it, and you wouldn't make it on most days, just today on this favourable layout|pg||
nt|sybarra: the Del'monte team needs to "pull up its sox"  as they say in baseball|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: then east will double|pg||
nt|athene: or might double|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if 1nt - 2@C; 2@D - 2@H is constructive, you can't risk stayman, i don't think|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: 2@C a GF relay, probably with lots of cunning coded sequences, but the double has changed all that|pg||
nt|athene: easy to see this making|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: I don't see how they can beat it, do you?|pg||
nt|athene: interesting view from west not to rebid |pg||
nt|athene: club lead to the @CK, lose spade, heart back, claim :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: down 2 or 3|pg||
nt|athene: good lead |pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: but in that case you just transfer|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, can't imagine why you wouldn't, go 2@C then 2@H unless they use that sequence for relay|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: comp. no is 2748|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: he sure has some playing strength|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: needs a trick from the defence here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there it is!|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: What would you have bid, diamonds or spades?|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess he decided he isn't winning the auction and he doesn't especially want a diamond, as opposed to spade, lead|pg||
nt|athene: i would be tempted to rebid 2@D|pg||
nt|petergill: The fate of 6@H shows the power of having good trump quality in one's slams|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jbgood: N will have to make a few discards on the @ds|pg||
nt|petergill: EW system is at http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2009/seniors/Braithwaite_Haughie.pdf|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mariner1: true if not garbage you have to trans to @H or pass|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: probably still just the 8|pg||
nt|frankaus: i back declarer for 9+|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but wait! may still have a @S stop|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: W/S closed the curtain and are discussing N's lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: spades blocked - easy nine|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: curtain open and W is thinking|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: curtain closed again|pg||
nt|jbgood: "curtains"|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: couldnt see what they were discussing|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: and ... open again, more thinking by w|pg||
nt|athene: there is a marked tendency amongst experts to lead the unexpected suit|pg||
pc|sT|nt|patricck: if those were my two options i'd still rather transfer to 2@H with a 5-4 hand, even with the terrible heart suit|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: yes, having a bad suit doesn't mean you don't want it to be trumps|pg||
nt|athene: if it looks as though the opponents are prepared for your natural lead, try something else|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|athene: in fact the worse your suit is, very often, the MORE you want it to be trumps|pg||
pc|dA|nt|royhughes: Difficult decision for West here, although it won't matter|pg||
nt|royhughes: Shifting to diamonds would be good if partner has Q10|pg||
nt|athene: well as soon as he starts thinking, north is happy|pg||
nt|athene: he knows east has the @CA :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, that's right|pg||
nt|royhughes: If partner has Axx in diamonds, though, you want to keep playing spades|pg||
nt|athene: yes you need partner to have something useful like @DAxx @CQxx|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: but a diamond caters for @DA @CQ and @DAQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good evening from partially sunny vancouver|pg||
pc|d7|nt|patricck: bad suit bad hand you want them to be trumps, but bad suit good hand is probably the reverse|pg||
nt|petergill: @S7 was upside down count, showing four spades|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: he had better cash out now|pg||
nt|athene: if he tries to make this (double spade finesse) the roof will fall in|pg||
nt|athene: assuming east clears clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well there is some kind of inference opponents do not have diamonds here, not really a random shot|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: except that if declarer had nine to run and was off the diamond suit, he wouldn't be holding up in spades :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: right|pg||
nt|frankaus: try to sneak a @H? after 5 @D|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|royhughes: Lusk didn't try for the overtrick by repeating the diamond finesse, I guess|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: sorry it's fixed - 10 tricks|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: he won't be that happy Patrick, alert did say 2@D forcing to game|pg||
nt|petergill: A Senior moment|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: by whom :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|royhughes: Well, declarer doesn't have a sure hand entry to play diamonds|pg||
nt|frankaus: new leader|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i often double with klinger's hand pattern, since i have a four card major, but 1nt is more normal|pg||
nt|bobholl: migth go down on @H lead :)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jbgood: one of the seniors:)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|patricck: thats a little strong, we all know strange things happen, but they are likely to bid it, yes|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mariner1: forget what? :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: is stiff @CK enough to accept the game try?|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmm,  my pards alwasy leap off the deep end in @S's when I double with that pattern |pg||
nt|fabsayc: now the defense will get all their tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe i need new pards?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bobholl: kibs say that it is down but now it isn't anymore :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|petergill: Del'monte might well lose their slim lead on this hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: needed his rabbi |pg||
pc|h2|nt|davidstern: Carfuk VG Op they may see this later|pg||
nt|davidstern: Careful|pg||
nt|athene: @D4 normal attitude, saying "i don't have @DK, we had better cash another club"|pg||
nt|athene: if west had @DAK and wanted to know if a second was standing up, he would lead the @DK|pg||
nt|athene: the only difficult for west comes when he has @DAxx and isn't sure whether to underlead to give a guess, which would be silly if there were a third club to cash :)|pg||
nt|patricck: 12 imps from 3NT in the other room, where Newman-Christie played an unsuccessful 5@C in this room means we have a new leader|pg||
nt|frankaus: NV or it would be even more certain|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|royhughes: but with the KJ tight he will be fine|pg||
nt|royhughes: so long as he plays for the drop|pg||
nt|royhughes: I wonder if there is some way to misguess, trying for an endplay|pg||
nt|athene: no real reason to refuse the finesse; if you could find out first that east had the @DA you might think about refusing it|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: i dont allow jumps over doubles without 5 card length :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: no, i am sure he will score up 430 very shortly|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hK|nt|royhughes: What if he ducks a diamond, and then tries to throw East in with clubs for a diamond return?|pg||
nt|royhughes: Braithwait maybe needed to throw a heart|pg||
nt|athene: but you don't have a fast entry to dummy if you play diamonds first as a discovery play|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||
nt|bobholl: should have played @D first :)|pg||
mc|8|nt|royhughes: so that he won't show out on the second club|pg||
nt|jbgood: may be the match decider|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am not so sure about that, gains only when east has exactly Kx in spades|pg||
nt|athene: now you might be running into club ruffs or anything|pg||
nt|athene: well, even if east has @SKxx, it might be good to get three rounds out the way fast, in case there's a club ruff lurking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if spade king onside, so are clubs so finesse not needed|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry not clever :)|pg||

nt|athene: i think if no diamond honour had appeared under the @DA, declarer would have played west for the @DK|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: N: "sorry to raise your lebensohl, you must have taken a bit of  fright"|pg||
nt|athene: Klinger perhaps took a long time after the @DA because he was considering if his partner held @DK4 doubleton?|pg||
nt|petergill: Still 8 boards to go in this semi final, and when we played this Del'monte team in the SNOT Grand Final on BBO 6 months ago, the lead did change hands on each of the last 6 boards, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: so there's plenty of time|pg||
nt|jbgood: but looking at W playing 2 @d may add some years to his age|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I remember Ish aged 12 when I used to play with his father|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: NS might be able to handle 4@S|pg||
nt|frankaus: more excitement here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as expected Richman was in game making|pg||
nt|patricck: The other table who started 2 boards behind have caught up, a situation Andy braithwaite will be used to :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Ish is not the youngest ever to npc a Seniors Team - Dan Korbel in his mid 20's npc'd Canada Seniors who topped the qualifiers in the WC in Shanghai in 2007|pg||
nt|petergill: Quite some hand for 2@h at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|patricck: My favourite Ish story is him bolstering his CV when applying to go to a bridge training weekend by saying he had won the Rotorua Open Pairs playing with me. We did win.....after ...|pg||
nt|patricck: he sent off his application!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: South would not expect to have three trump losers in a @D contract|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 24: 2@D -50 looks good for Del'monte .... !!!!|pg||
nt|patricck: my spies tell me that 1NT* is about to make in the other room....by NS!!!!  2@D down 1 will be a pickup|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 24: other table is in 1NTX by Sotuh which might well make for 180 and a 4 imp gain|pg||
nt|henryb: a truly boring hand: nothing to the bidding and little to the play|pg||
mb|1D|nt|patricck: they wouldn't want to lead a spade against 5@C though|pg||
nt|frankaus: some would open N a muid 2@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: some level of nt or spades by e/w|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: aggressive double on a ten count facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C = potential for another mixup?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: has anyone ever passed on your 1st go with an 8 card suit?|pg||
nt|patricck: apparently in the other room South thought that North had opened 1@D so was responding 1NT....but it was actually an overcall|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt best but i think can survive in 4@S also|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: i guess it's OK with perfect shape and two aces|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I hate Bill's weak 2@C game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S+2 here, should be both speedy and flat|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes however he is NV vs VUL so jacking the auction up|pg||
nt|bobholl: double or @S with w hand ?|pg||
nt|ish1: 1@S|pg||
mb|3C|nt|frankaus: may lead to a good ? 4@S save|pg||
nt|jbgood: me too, not to mention 5 spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: to me he has a 4@S opener and thats it|pg||
nt|patricck: i don't like it much either, but then again there isn't an action with that hand that I DO like particularly|pg||
nt|jbgood: N might save in 7@d - he will not expect S to have 2 aces for his nonvulnerable jump|pg||
nt|frankaus: more then a few riding on opening lead if the get to 6@S|pg||
nt|frankaus: @CA looks standout tho|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: 3nt by east isn't so bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@S can make|pg||
nt|athene: the 3@C opener might find the @DQ for them - but maybe not, when east shows out on the first trump|pg||
nt|sybarra: Klinger hoping spades of course|pg||
mb|4H|nt|royhughes: Great fitting hands and some luck here -- you could make a slam|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: H shows a STRONG takeout of 3@C :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H showed clubs and a red suit, a 5/5 two suiter I think|pg||
nt|jbgood: this should go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: Yes, you would think so|pg||
nt|mariner1: he has to play K@H in E and can play W for all the rest he needs|pg||
nt|frankaus: back christie to make this|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@S can make, and so might 5@C E?W if they were to get a spade lead, this could be  a very big board|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am "punting" for a make :)|pg||
nt|athene: west's 3NT bid at unfavourable certainly suggests he has the @DQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: i would too but 1 partner off mine would bid double (if you know italian style  isn't that bad )|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: andrew cues at the 7 level what a man|pg||
nt|jbgood: so W took his prd seriously - nice bid|pg||
nt|frankaus: CAN the find the 8@D save :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: whats the point of a cue at the 7 level is he inviting 8|pg||
nt|patricck: using bidding boxes....couldn't find the right card|pg||
nt|petergill: 9 top tricks |pg||
nt|henryb: I would open 1NT unless precluded by range|pg||
pc|d8|nt|royhughes: There is some danger in crossing to dummy to finesse trumps, but not much|pg||
nt|jbgood: you dont really have a 5 loser hand when you bid 5 @s|pg||
nt|petergill: until @DA gets ruffed, to declarer's dismay|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: wont he get a shock now|pg||
nt|athene: you would be unlucky to run into club lead to @CA and spade switch|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 loser too much :)|pg||
nt|ish1: yes to high|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kiwibridge: T Reese : lead an Ace|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think I head an "ugh"  from Brown |pg||
nt|fabsayc: the pregnant pause while you memorize the spade spots|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|henryb: hard to see how he avoids losing 3@s and a @d|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, NS get A@S A@H and a @C ruff, and east has nowhere to put his diamond losers|pg||
nt|athene: but 4@H is fine even with the club ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade return not clear|pg||
nt|ish1: but N/S were making 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|ish1: or clubs|pg||
nt|bobholl: migth indeed gain 1 imp :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: A of @C and await signal !|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: use every entry to lead up to east spades|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|royhughes: On to the next|pg||
nt|royhughes: Declarer maybe made 6|pg||
nt|patricck: you are already finessing east for the K@H, seems like overkill to play them for the Q@D as well, so I am sure declarer will get the diamonds right|pg||
nt|athene: AKxx trumps gives you a lot of control over the play - but just not enough, here|pg||
nt|frankaus: this a good save LOL :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: trying to cash side winners wont work|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: now he has ten tricks and leads towards the @SK later for the 11th|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|hT|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: North's @CQ was an emphatic suit pref signal for @HA, not another @D|pg||
nt|henryb: except North already has the tap suit: clubs|pg||
nt|athene: draw trumps, unblock @DQ, cross to @CQ, pitch spade on @DK first for safety|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mariner1: Doubly Good :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: thinking about the overtrick now :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: would not pay to be Chrometophobic here|pg||

nt|mariner1: or at least a treatment|pg||
nt|fabsayc: brown might have 3nt, especially if 3@D only showed three spades|pg||
nt|athene: south will overcall 2@H or show a 2-suiter?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: that's a thin opening bid|pg||
nt|athene: positively anorexic|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT here 4 me  at these colours |pg||
nt|athene: either way he catches fair heart support :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now everyone will have lots to say|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: have been impressed by Buchen team performance as sort of expected similar result to the other semi|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C @C+@H presumable|pg||
nt|athene: presumably|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: I'm sympathetic -- I like aces and kings|pg||
nt|athene: and north, with the best hand at the table, will be mildly bemused|pg||
nt|patricck: everybody's 3NT isn't it?|pg||
nt|petergill: Raising to 4@H is automatic in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: NS have a shot at 4@S -- may be tricky to find the suit|pg||
nt|royhughes: Double must have shown hearts, I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: super accept here?|pg||
nt|athene: Klinger didn't think so|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Ouch|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 2 down so losing 2 imps :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: did he need to go 2 down?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|royhughes: Maybe they play transfers over overcalls|pg||
nt|athene: if you think that 1@D overcalls should be either a good hand or good suit, north could just bid 3nt|pg||
nt|royhughes: Will South pass, or continue with showing spades?|pg||
nt|athene: the traditional meaning of 1@C (1@D) X is 44 majors, but many are rejecting that |pg||
nt|athene: in order to get the transfers in|pg||
nt|athene: rehi everyone...|pg||
nt|athene: hmmmmm|pg||
nt|athene: surely Hughes had a NF 3@D bid over 3@C?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: X = hearts; 1@H = spades|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps they don't want to play U vs U when 4@C would force so high|pg||
pc|sK|nt|royhughes: I think spades plays better than notrump|pg||
nt|patricck: N/S would make 4@S if they located the J@S, but neither of them could sensibly enter the auction here|pg||
nt|petergill: Buchen team won the National Seniors Teams in January from all these other guys. |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps north was worried that 1@S would be a) non-forcing or b) promise 5|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, I don't blame him for thinking NT should be ok|pg||
nt|bobholl: think so on continous @D and @C|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: comical for the spectators|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kiwibridge: yes coffee hand|pg||
nt|henryb: I would show a minimum with four trumps|pg||
nt|othered1: simple transfer auction.  Some, who use Smolen, would start with 2@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: too much in spades and queens really for superaccept|pg||
nt|henryb: even some of us who don't would start with 2@c|pg||
nt|othered1: south has no attractive lead.  Stiff trump may tell declarer lots about the hand|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: west was certainly hitting 3nt - he knows the diamonds aren't going anywhere fast|pg||
nt|athene: it's pretty rare you want to play in 2nt, if you have a 6-card suit|pg||
nt|athene: if the suit runs, you normally make 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: if it doesn't, you probably go down in 2|pg||
nt|athene: but south probably just wanted to pass before the doubling started :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think so|pg||
nt|frankaus: is there any point to 2@C?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes promote a minor suit lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
nt|patricck: presumably Buchen was aiming at 5 of a minor if there was a spade weakness|pg||
nt|frankaus: maybe looking 4 5-3 @H fit|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: it's certainly a good idea to play the same scheme of 2-suited overcalls as your partner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and not make it complicated with vulnerability and opponents system|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|royhughes: I see only 6 tricks for declarer|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|petergill: Buchen - Christie completely dominated the datums when their Aussie Team won the PABF Seniors on the Gold Coast last year. |pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart to ten before south has much information|pg||
pc|h3|nt|royhughes: given West's club shift|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: just to discuss West's possible actions over 3@C:-|pg||
nt|athene: if opps show a 2-suited overcall, you have 2 cue-bids available|pg||
nt|athene: if both suits are specified|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: so it's common to play something called "unusual vs unusual"|pg||
nt|athene: where cue-bidding one of the overcaller's suits shows a forcing bid in the 4th suit|pg||
nt|athene: and the other cue-bid shows a strong raise for partner's opened suit|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c8|pg||
nt|royhughes: West needs to stay off hearts here to get the maximum|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: that means that a free bid in the fourth suit can be NF|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kiwibridge: I'd expect a concession other SF gap now almost 100|pg||

nt|jbgood: ouch is as good a comment as any|pg||
nt|jbgood: very diplomatic actually|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: EW play a 14+-17 1NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@D seems a bit much, not to mention a Burn's Law violation|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks Peter great info|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm  - Burn's Laws|pg||
nt|mariner1: only part scores here though could see some action|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: they had a very complcated auction with a misunderstanding, i think 6d was a reply to something|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: bbo had a hiccup|pg||
nt|petergill: Both Henry and Chris are very cool guys, I don't think either will be rattled by their disaster just then. |pg||
nt|petergill: A Senior moment. |pg||
nt|sybarra: how many @S?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: so 4@S just losing the @SAQ i suppose|pg||
nt|royhughes: looks that way|pg||
nt|royhughes: Do they play Texas?|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT = @C and @H I hope|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes and 3@H = @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@C = concservative, I would have bid 5@C. |pg||
nt|othered1: 3 or 4 unless EW get out of hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was wondering how many to bid the first time |pg||
nt|bobholl: play 2@C as natural over 2+ @C ?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|henryb: X = "snapdragon" clubs with @h tolerance|pg||
mb|1S|nt|petergill: On Bd 24 the accidental passer of 2@D gained 4 imps, but I don't see how minus 620 can be good for NS on Bd 26, but you never know|pg||
mb|2H|nt|royhughes: East may consider a slam try|pg||
nt|mariner1: well no action after all|pg||
nt|frankaus: lead back to buchen|pg||
nt|frankaus: Kanetkar lead troughout the double round robbin - must be either 1. in good form,  or,  2. due for a bad set|pg||
nt|henryb: 1, Shirley. natural and forcing|pg||
nt|othered1: What's wrong with 1@S?  You have @S and partner opened -- it's your hand|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kiwibridge: sensible idea|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: But he needs a perfect hand|pg||
nt|athene: the east hand certainly looks appropriate for Texas - you don't really have much slam interest|pg||
nt|frankaus: 1. is more likely|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H was a @D raise, delaying the decision of how high to raise until later|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: You don't really need partner to play it, I suppose|pg||
nt|frankaus: Link to web scoring for both semi's  - http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=spo&E=1&R=&T=R |pg||
nt|mariner1: Erin board 25 did not get scored here|pg||
nt|patricck: needs a @H switch when the Q@C wins to beat this|pg||
nt|sybarra: I forgot S hand opened the hand |pg||
nt|bobholl: they play transfer walsh or so ? otherwise don't understand 2 @H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|patricck: oops, played from the other side|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: agree 1. it is|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Over 2NT, North felt no need to preempt EW when West had already described his hand so accurately.  |pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING SCORES ****  LADY MILNE  LIMERICK ****  N-IRELAND 78, SCOTLAND 67, IRELAND 63, ENGLAND 59, CBAI 50, WALES 39 ****|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 25 was flat, although the sequence of play in 4@s was completely different from our table. |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a lot play transfer resposnes to the (possible) short club|pg||
nt|bobholl: even 2 @H migth prove too high :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|royhughes: It looks to me like 3@c was forcing to game since West bid only 3@s on a great hand|pg||
nt|patricck: that wasn't a very good slam that Gaspar-Richman reached, 12 more imps to the Buchen team|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: why are we not seeing both semis?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: declarer doesn't want west to win the @HK and switch to a diamond|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: christie hesitated a ittle on the 1st spade trick|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's down to the wire then|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart continuations will tell the declarer about spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and he has a squeeze on east for the other key cards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: looks like 6 losers|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 2@S on so fairly inconsequential :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|petergill: A trump and @SA to lose for minus one|pg||
nt|athene: hence rise @HA|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|athene: he might play restricted choice in clubs|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|athene: reasoning that Neill would have led a 5-card suit if he had one|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: hence the lead of a heart from 4, with stiff spade, suggests 1-4-4-4|pg||
nt|athene: so @CKQ dropping @CJ or @C10, and then finesse|pg||
nt|bobholl: good defence @D tricks won't disappear :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|royhughes: moving right along|pg||
nt|petergill: -2 now, misguessing|pg||
pc|s7|nt|fabsayc: going down now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: klinger squeezing his dummy|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: of sorry, only in 3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i was playing 4@S|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|athene: of course he wouldn't risk that if it meant possibly going down|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: i would have led a diamond for sure from the east hand|pg||
nt|athene: but 4-card majors are longer than 5-card minors for many people these days :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: they beat 2 @S in the other room?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@S-1 was a "cow flew over" line|pg||
nt|sybarra: something like that |pg||
nt|henryb: will N-S fet in the auction?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with both get|pg||
nt|henryb: after W opens 1@d and E bids 1@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: against the odds surely|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: looks like a routine 3N|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north might try 1NT here|pg||
nt|athene: so board 25 turns into a double doubled game-swing|pg||
nt|mariner1: 25 was 16 imps,,,,,,,, a doubled double game swing,,,,,,,,,, say that 5 times|pg||
nt|mariner1: quickly|pg||
nt|patricck: double and 1NT?|pg||
nt|petergill: South must have been playing for West not to be 55 (else 3505) perhaps 2506? |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: at best a partial here|pg||
nt|petergill: due to the non-5@C call by East?|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 NT has its chanses|pg||
mb|1N|nt|royhughes: Right -- and it's the wrong vulnerability for trapping|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, but with 12 opposite 12 can be hard to stay in a partial|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: often when your only long suit has been bid naturally by opps it reduces your playing strength, but north has all the diamond spots|pg||
nt|athene: indeed the spade lead against 5@C was fatal, allowing two fast diamond pitches|pg||
nt|henryb: I would NOT make a red overcall with N|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|athene: as was suggested as a possibility at our table|pg||
nt|mariner1: ok Bill, is it a doubled double game swing, or a double doubled game swing? :)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|petergill: Peter Buchen will be surprised to have dropped imps on Bd 26|pg||
mb|3N|nt|henryb: I would balance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@C now reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: option 2 i think :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: "bad board" is another way to describe it|pg||
nt|othered1: That's not close to an overcall for me, and I'd consider balancing, but would chicken out at the colors|pg||
nt|athene: declarer is going to go down here i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: Conservative by Chan, wouldn't you say?|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|athene: he has two diamonds and @SA to lose and he can't do anything with the fourth heart|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: considering he invited with a 6-count on board 7, maybe|pg||
nt|royhughes: It's like what you said about playing 2N with a 6-card suit|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: can't get to @CA and south is overruffing dummy|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: cu all again in 50 minutes|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: bye for now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|royhughes: I don't know their exact range, of course|pg||
nt|sybarra: and poor S,  E stole his bid |pg||
pc|d6|nt|bobholl: looks like inquiring for 5 crd major ( in holland we call that niemijer)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: there might be a very cunning squeeze of some sort|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT was 11-12 bal, no 4 card major|pg||
nt|athene: if he just runs trumps|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mariner1: Bill might be Doxophobic :)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|royhughes: But it seems to me you might as well try for 9 tricks and the bonus|pg||
nt|athene: the defence might only have to slip up a little bit for there to be a winkle squeeze or something exotic|pg||
nt|athene: basically in this sort of situation, where you have enough tricks except there's a blockage, you can often enlist a defender's aid|pg||
nt|athene: so south might come under pressure |pg||
nt|athene: if he keeps @CQx you can unblock and use him to reach the dummy; if he throws all his clubs you can overtake the @CK and score two clubs by force|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is a pseudo stepping stone|pg||
nt|athene: of course the count isn't rectified for any of this fun and games|pg||
nt|fabsayc: klinger heart pitch says ruffing a heart will not work|pg||
nt|athene: Hughes will be wondering how likely it is that south is out of hearts|pg||
nt|athene: yes, the @H2 pitch is very unlikely to be from four|pg||
nt|athene: plus south returned a heart looking like a man wanting to overruff dummy|pg||
nt|athene: well i am not at the table but i bet that is what he looks like :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|s3|pc|dT|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s9|nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: certainly, it's much more relaxing to be defending 2nt, rather than 3nt|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can just give up a club...the defence only have four tricks to take at most|pg||
pc|d9|nt|othered1: now south is endplayed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond finesse was a kind of safety play|pg||
nt|othered1: but more @H willprevail|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: the defence can prevail, as north has two big diamonds|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|henryb: He knows W has 4@s, 5@d and 2@c|pg||
pc|c8|nt|fabsayc: so a slightly non deserved gain for del'monte team|pg||
nt|othered1: wasn't @D finesse just a misguess, rather than an (un)safety play?|pg||
nt|athene: i think if south had two of the diamond honours there would be no defence|pg||
nt|athene: but i might be wrong - it's late here :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oops|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: now a diamond|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mariner1: take A@D or lose it|pg||
nt|athene: might as well cash the @DA to hold to nine|pg||
nt|athene: yes he had to try one diamond earlier i think to tighten up the position|pg||
nt|athene: now there's no chance|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: if partner has the @SA, you are beating it anyway - if not, you aren't getting your @DA|pg||
nt|mariner1: A@D gone|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well south has to pitch a club|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Steve - I know you and Peter play transfers over your 1@C opening -- have you experimented with transfers in comp?|pg||

nt|royhughes: Chan's card says 15-18 for 1N overcall|pg||
nt|patricck: some good words there Rob, but do you have anything to describe 33 Imps in 2 boards?|pg||
nt|athene: i see the auction to 6@D has been censored|pg||
nt|petergill: Four boards to go - with Del'monte looking the favourites at this stage|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so close looking at 31-32 open room scores|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure what to call it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: full count|pg||
nt|athene: well, you were right about the pseudo stepping stone :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mariner1: Arithmophobia|pg||
nt|sybarra: had spec ask something similar,  since no balance by N |pg||
nt|henryb: earned at the other table where Gaspar and richman are playing something really unusual|pg||
mb|1H|nt|royhughes: Lusk opens the major|pg||
nt|jbgood: the dealing machine has been very generous to us kibs today:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a singleton diamond in north would have made the balance more attractive|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C against @H (or @D) @C won't win :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|royhughes: I like to open the long suit -- what about you, Bill?|pg||
nt|royhughes: 3@c must be an artificial raise|pg||
nt|athene: i tend to prefer the 6-card suit yes|pg||
nt|royhughes: But both methods must be playable, I think|pg||
nt|athene: but 1@S will work out just fine here|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, decent of partner to have 4-card support|pg||
nt|athene: that's the problem with the internet - there might be young children watching at any point :)|pg||
nt|athene: so perhaps these things are best left hidden|pg||
nt|patricck: no, arithmophobia is no good, I don't think fear of numbers really covers it :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Today's winners play Terry Brown - Avi Kanetkar, Paul Lavings - Robert Krochmalik and Bruce Neill - Mike Hughes (a strong team) tomorrow for the right to go to Brazil to rep ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Australia.|pg||
nt|patricck: Buchen could have made 5@C EW on board 27, if he had the scores would have been only half an imp apart|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3@C makes 3@H doesnt|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: again the transfer|pg||
mb|2C|nt|royhughes: 4@s will require some handling to bring in the diamonds, if NS get to play it|pg||
nt|petergill: The losers tomorrow go to Macau to rep Aus in the PABF in June|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|mariner1: we are often abreticular its true Bill :)|pg||
nt|athene: how about "irrational fear of showing your majors in response to Stayman"?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well you need to fear the Opponents getting BIG numbers from you :)|pg||
nt|athene: of course i am sure i am maligning east and he doesn't really suffer from that at all|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: bd 26: 1h 2c 2d 2h 3c 3d 3h 3s 4c 5c 5d 6d ppp|pg||
nt|petergill: So the winners of this match win Aussie representative caps, so there could be some nerves|pg||
nt|bobholl: worth 2@D ?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: you lead a small diamond towards the @DQ and are happy-ish if west gets a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: as happy as you ever are when your winner gets ruffed :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: yes, indeed -- better for the defence to play clubs or hearts, maybe|pg||
nt|royhughes: hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: in our "trials" the winners could chose to go to Macau :)|pg||
nt|petergill: That choice applies here too, I believe, Gary|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we still don't know what they have decided|pg||
nt|henryb: If S bids 4@s, as I would, ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: I doubt you can beat it if declarer plays carefully|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: victory for the minor :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: did i say @C won't win ?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: 2@C will be puppet or "Kerrie" or whatever it's called|pg||
nt|patricck: ppp at the end of that was short for puke puke puke?|pg||
nt|patricck: slam may look like it is just on the heart finesse, but actually it is on the @H behaving + there being no outside ruff, so this is a slam you would rather not be in|pg||
nt|jbgood: 1@d transfer? 2@d art gf?|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H - 5@C P P 5@H I predict|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it was over a week ago but we are still in the dark|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4NT seems fine, gets to gist of hand|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Terry has just called the director|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: 1S was apparently a transfer to 1nt|pg||
nt|bobholl: this maigth be a substantial gain if 2@H is allowed in the other room |pg||
pc|h3|nt|royhughes: but let's see what happens|pg||
pc|h6|nt|frankaus: i have been told klinger no longer plats Kerrie|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|petergill: I think South will pass 5@C then dbl 5@H |pg||
nt|athene: a pushy 3@D rebid!|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jbgood: 5 @c is a downer on repeated spade leads - but how is W to know? He may be afraid that E only has 3 hearts and 2 spades though|pg||
nt|athene: he is clearly feeling on a roll after bringing in that no-play game|pg||
pc|h9|nt|royhughes: EW play low encourages|pg||
nt|petergill: I have rarely before been able to predict players' bids on BBO - could this be a first?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|frankaus: but some other form of enq |pg||
nt|petergill: No|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Spade lead is normal. |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|royhughes: So West asked for a heart continuation|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|athene: declarer has to lose to the @HA as well, even when the clubs come in for four tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: No reason not to play three rounds of @S to promote @S10|pg||
nt|petergill: @C10 I mean|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jbgood: up north we play 2@h direct on the E hand after transfer as 4 cards heart and 12-14. So 1@h is either 3, or some strong hand if 4 |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|frankaus: 2@C = puppet to 2@D the reasp discribes hand|pg||
nt|athene: north just didn't have a spot card higher than the @S6|pg||
nt|athene: well, he did have, but he wasted it at trick 1 |pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: if he had led a big spot here, declarer would have had a decision|pg||
nt|athene: whether to rise with the @SA or hold it up|pg||

nt|royhughes: I'll have to check it out afterwards -- tomorrow, that is|pg||
nt|patricck: looks like its all over|pg||
nt|petergill: so lead is 24, with effectively one board to gain masses of imps for the Buchen team |pg||
nt|othered1: will east open?|pg||
nt|othered1: and with what?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 ht?  2 suited or ?|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm a passer unless I have a gadget for the 2-suiter|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if playing multi i might open a two suited 2@H bid|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@h?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: certainly ruffing with a trump winner was wrong - it can even be wrong to ruff with a trump LOSER - there's a famous hand where Hamman did just that|pg||
nt|athene: refusing to over-ruff from just xxx trumps|pg||
nt|royhughes: I remember that one|pg||
nt|athene: west is likely to insist on game now, facing an opening bid|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I suspect that is it but a great match thx to the abf for bringing it to us|pg||
nt|sybarra: I win |pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@H is too sick for me|pg||
nt|bobholl: agian a partscore battle @S gaining now ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and caused declarer to lose control eventually and go more down|pg||
nt|petergill: This hardly looks like the dynamite board Buchen needs|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: kept out of trouble board 9 other room|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: but i don't think it's going to make|pg||
nt|henryb: is that 2 suits or a normal weak 2|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@H maybe at matchpoints, where I have only one teammate owed an apology when it goes dreadfully wrong.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: stoled the pot,  not sure he will be happy he did |pg||
nt|fabsayc: but not if there is a smoke break after round|pg||
nt|bobholl: but NS migth not bid at all :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: looks fine now|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt now from south|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pass|pg||
nt|athene: double is possible too :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW have only 2 scores on their side in 12 boards......  won imps on 5 though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: should be a great final tomorrow Kanetkar having had a nice rest|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S all pass one would think|pg||
nt|jbgood: :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Braithwaite and Haughie keen to represent their adopted country|pg||
nt|athene: this will be passed out and make plenty of tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4 @H on !|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Terry splinters|pg||
nt|bobholl: what is 2 @H a misprint ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: on his meagre opening :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|royhughes: Good memory, Bill -- that hand was quite a while ago|pg||
nt|athene: now a quiet 2@H from north|pg||
nt|athene: not exactly what south wanted to hear :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@C is rarely the best spot for opponents, so especially if they are vul i let them play there|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: yes, they're ahead 5 swings to 3 :)|pg||
nt|athene: ok, West settles for simply inviting|pg||
nt|athene: klinger thinking of inviting? that's aggressive facing a passed hand, NV|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: There's something to be said for 2@d by North|pg||
nt|royhughes: It may be wrong, but will work out well sometimes|pg||
nt|athene: well, if you have game, it's likely to be because you have six hearts|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, I don't quarrel with 2@h|pg||
nt|athene: so i have sympathy for 2@H, even if 2@D will sometimes be a safer spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: spot on Peter |pg||
nt|athene: you are playing for the right 11-count opposite|pg||
nt|bobholl: they seem to understand each other but 1@D 2@H on that hand ??|pg||
pc|h3|nt|royhughes: With one partner, I played that 2@c denied holding 3 hearts -- then South can continue with 2@h on a doubleton if he has a good hand|pg||
nt|royhughes: Playing that way, 2@d is more attractive|pg||
nt|royhughes: But it is an eccentric way to play|pg||
nt|athene: hehehe well after all that, north did bid 2@D :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: sorry the room is very dark and they are using written bidding|pg||
nt|royhughes: The joke's on us|pg||
nt|athene: no problem|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mariner1: so BAM we would be looking at opposite results|pg||
nt|petergill: Kanetkar's opponents in their semi had done very well just to make the semis, being a last minute team scavenged together when the field was one team short.|pg||
nt|athene: although one thing is that in this situation, the play often goes very well|pg||
nt|athene: because you know west has everything|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: i am glad no-one ever has to rely on MY handwriting to see what i have bid|pg||
nt|royhughes: One argument for 2@d is that partner is quite likely to be short in hearts, and you could lose quite a few trump tricks|pg||
nt|athene: it's hard for partner to raise the "indecipherable squiggle" suit|pg||
nt|royhughes: :)|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps East thought it was forcing? 3NT very pushy facing a NF 3@S bid|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, they would be happy at board-a-match|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: prsumably limited, brown maybe thought stronger|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they have (luckily) found the magic, this could be a good gain|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: so you can often place cards and bring home 22 or 23 count 3NT contracts, endplaying and squeezing the opener|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mariner1: this can make now|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|patricck: can and should|pg||
nt|athene: a club lead would have been a lot better|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mariner1: has to win q here|pg||
nt|patricck: it may have been the unbid suit, but i hate leading Jxx|pg||
nt|athene: it was close between a club and a heart, i think, on this auction|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs the 4th @H|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer has four diamonds, @CAK, three hearts|pg||
nt|athene: the defence only have @SAK, @DK, @HK|pg||
nt|athene: for example, on the cards here, you might well make 3nt|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he can win A@H and lead one back to Q@H|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: 3@C shows extra values of course...all very reasonable|pg||
nt|royhughes: Chan decides to try 3N, rather than an 11-trick game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does take a heart lead to beat 3nt it seems|pg||
nt|athene: Kanetkar are fighting their way back into the match|pg||
nt|athene: 14 imps from the Ghestem misunderstanding just kicked in|pg||
pc|c3|nt|royhughes: Yes, it looks well-judged to me|pg||
nt|royhughes: NS are unlucky that 3rd hand has both spade honours|pg||
nt|royhughes: On any other lie the spade lead would blow a trick|pg||
nt|athene: they are also unlucky that east can win the @CA and put another spade through|pg||
nt|royhughes: Declarer has 8 tricks after playing a club|pg||
nt|petergill: So Kanetkar will have a major lift in class of opposition tomorrow|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: now the defence have 2 spades, @CA, @HA set up|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, you're right|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: (3@C, instead of 4@H on 6-5 fit)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: oops|pg||
pc|s8|nt|frankaus: the lead starting to look formitable even with 36 hands to score|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|patricck: feels like there should be a way for the defence to beat this, but the spades are such that everything doesn't quite seem to work|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|patricck: ouch, another 15 to Buchen.....48 imps in 4 boards....and one of them was a push!!!!|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|royhughes: But 5 rounds of diamonds might put West under pressure|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps declarer has to get cute to make this|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: west has stuff in all three non-diamond suits|pg||
nt|frankaus: tho at 15+ at a time it can change quickly|pg||
nt|mariner1: Buchen has a loss coming up though|pg||
nt|athene: i have to say, when people lead short suits against 3nt, trying to find partner, it has a very low success rate|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: leading a long suit which dummy has shown, really doesn't work|pg||
nt|athene: but leading a long suit which declarer has shown 4 in is very often fine|pg||
pc|d7|nt|patricck: leading xx trying to find parter has a better chance than Jxx|pg||
nt|othered1: unlucky lead, but they're still going plus, I think.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes south gets 3 more trumps, better not pitch here or down 2|pg||
nt|othered1: agree|pg||
nt|sybarra: ruff and lead a club looks best|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
mc|10|nt|athene: and is going to get crushed for sure|pg||
nt|royhughes: I guess his best shot may be to play a heart|pg||
nt|athene: well he would have done if declarer rose the @SA there|pg||
nt|athene: to preserve a menace in spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: playing this as a dummy reversal|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only to find clubs 3-3 so not necessary|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but alls still well he couldn't really go wrong|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Avi apologises and states that he thought that Terry opened 1s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nice Adam, still seething over the previos director call?|pg||
nt|bobholl: they play with screens ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
nt|bobholl: than i understand it better :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and bidding boxes presumably where @D's are usually red and @S's are black|pg||

nt|sybarra: more gadgets in the other room |pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S is makeable here but diamond ruff makes it tough|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S here looks very normal, even though 3N often will score.  And I think you still need to misguess the hand, even if @D ruff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: are they having a post mortem, I puck a lucky gain|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: another exciting hand here|pg||
nt|jbgood: bye all, nice show, can you please wish Ish gl in the final, Peter?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 6@S may have been insurance vs 6@H though|pg||
nt|athene: west decided to take the "safe" option in case one of his aces wasn't cashing|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: pick|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: some people might open 1NT with that south hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chick: certainly will be now |pg||
nt|thegarve:  1NT?|pg||
nt|snorris: must be 1nt|pg||
nt|chick: probably :)|pg||
nt|athene: 5 @C 4@H isn't an ideal shape to open but with 3 spades you can raise the inconvenient 1@S response so you don't have that much of a rebid problem|pg||
nt|petergill: A good effort by the Buchen team, but not quite good enough, unless EW go crazy and go minus 1100 here|pg||
mb|d|nt|petergill: ok|pg||
nt|othered1: can't reasonably keep out of @S from here, can they?|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: I would be extremely unhappy to reach only 5|pg||
nt|mariner1: octonce|pg||
nt|patricck: i think they have to double 71S to get 18 :)|pg||
nt|athene: not sure what Neill was leading from three-card club holding - but Hughes did lead @S7 from @SK74 earlier|pg||
nt|athene: @SK72 sorry|pg||
mb|1S|nt|petergill: A comfortable win for Del'monte (Ish = npc, for those who think Ish has aged 25 years overnight) as it turns out |pg||
mb|2D|nt|mariner1: W has an awfully strong hand for 1N imho|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S from west?|pg||
nt|athene: then east will bid slam surely|pg||
nt|frankaus: chance here 4 pickup|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can this one be bid?|pg||
nt|henryb: Sorry Adam. I should have called you by name|pg||
nt|othered1: What do you lose?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3NT the spot|pg||
nt|bobholl: great result for del'monte in other room |pg||
mb|3H|nt|frankaus: 5@S = OUT slam try works|pg||
nt|patricck: a very good slam, but looks like a tough one to bid|pg||
nt|frankaus: this will help|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3N interesting choice other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: and my co-commentator, William Frisby of England|pg||
nt|mariner1: any slam try works here :)|pg||
nt|athene: diamond raise from North might work to his side's disadvantage|pg||
nt|mariner1: or should|pg||
nt|petergill: Getting easier to bid now after the 2@D transfer|pg||
nt|henryb: two hearts and a spade in a club contract|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mariner1: there is a slam try|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, the key feature was that in the other room N/S were bidding hearts, much more worrying for East|pg||
nt|patricck: Braithwaite won't be encouraged to hear about the diamonds sitting over him though|pg||
nt|frankaus: this wont|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: could be a GOOD one for del'monte|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: I am Roy Hughes from Canada -- thank you all for watching|pg||
nt|athene: the next segment is coming up in an hour i think?|pg||
nt|royhughes: That sounds right -- I just remember it was too late for me|pg||
nt|athene: 6@S sounds very like a diamond void - west must be tempted|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Klinger leaning back in his chair to tank awhile|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: south falls asleep|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nice when pard transfers to your AKQx|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: it's being suggested that 6@D would sound more like a diamond void|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this is last hand of this set |pg||
nt|fabsayc: greedy double|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: This is a borderline slam that goes down with the king of clubs wrong|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL coming??? :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: nope|pg||
nt|athene: but east is a bit short of side aces|pg||
nt|athene: plus he doesn't want to tip off the heart lead|pg||
pc|d4|nt|royhughes: It would be a bad slam to bid, surely, and EW stop in a good spot|pg||
nt|athene: you can't go round bidding slams with NO first-round controls|pg||
nt|petergill: Haughie reasoned that if @CK was missing, on the bidding it would be offside - hence his conservative bidding|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: east put just the 8 down and waited for a disappointed gasp from west before putting down akq and laughing|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|henryb: they are overboard in all contracts now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: i think 7@S was certainly not impossible to find - although it wasn't easy of course by any means, either|pg||
nt|mariner1: thanks all !|pg||
nt|athene: well done to Klinger|pg||
nt|frankaus: only 17 :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: so a close match again|pg||
nt|athene: it was doubly hard in that there was no way 7@S could induce a phantom save|pg||
nt|athene: which is where a lot of your equity comes from in these situations, very often|pg||
nt|athene: if you are V vs NV and opps have a higher-ranking suit, you might sometimes bid an iffy grand, as opps will take the insurance|pg||
nt|jbgood: even with a worthless @d king slam is on|pg||
nt|petergill: some care is required to make 3NT on a spade lead, such as ensuring that when @HJx drops, the ten can be cashed and  there's an entry to @HQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to Adam our terrific operator in Oz :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: yes, even with the @CK right it would need some work|pg||
nt|royhughes: that's right|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Thanks all|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also to Henry, Ed and Martin,   great commentators all @H@H@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 12 big ones del monte here|pg||
nt|bobholl: who has the 3 of @D ?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kiwibridge: is he 40 yet?|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks |pg||
nt|athene: this doesn't look too trivial on a third spade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: down|pg||
nt|athene: i think he can make but he might end up having to squeeze east in the minors|pg||
nt|athene: so just lose two spades, then an overruff, and just one diamond|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can never score diamond jack|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|frankaus: last tu all 4 ur company  - more excitement - final set  sch in 20 minutes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Haughie Humour|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes,  2@d Dbl 6@h directly was a possible call, planning to pitch spades on clubs. |pg||
nt|jbgood: see you then - bye|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: beeen great thx specs for your feedback see you all back here soon|pg||
nt|frankaus: actual margin is only 7.5 imps so no draw possible|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|othered1: Adam and all.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: mind you, the squeeze against east is working|pg||
nt|athene: east is already squeezed!|pg||
nt|athene: that's quite funny in a way :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well not truely since he can underruff|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: and to the AFB, and Nick and all the others who brought this terrific tourney to BBO |pg||
nt|bobholl: minus 2 now :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: perhaps there is a squeeze|pg||
nt|athene: underruff costs him a trump trick|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|petergill: No|pg||
pc|s5|nt|royhughes: So good night from here, or good morning if you're there .. thanks Bill -- see you later|pg||
nt|athene: ok thanks...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: have to lead heart to king and then run the clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe pitch @S on @D9 and endplay south|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
nt|henryb: there is an easy play to make|pg||
nt|sybarra: and of course we love our specs,  greatest audience in the world, we love your comments  |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: even better|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bobholl: no difference also 12 imps|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
nt|henryb: simply strip @d and endplay S on the third @h|pg||
nt|athene: can throw south in to give ruff sluff, so the @S5 goes away|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i prefer the squeeze|pg||
nt|athene: ah - he can't afford another trump promo though|pg||
mc|8|nt|kiwibridge: yes twas 13|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry vuln 13 imps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: just one score to come board 14|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Thanks all|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: restart should be within the next 15 minutes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks Adam great job, thx Kibs great feedback, thx to the abf for bringing this to us, thx Bob great job|pg||
nt|bobholl: next set starting at 5:45 your time or earlier ?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Thanks all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes very soon indeed|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: In approx. 15 minutes the next segment will begin|pg||
pg||
