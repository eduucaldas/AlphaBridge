mb|d|nt|santyclz: The "dottir" part is a clue.|pg||

nt|mariner1: hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely a mistake opertor?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: its frigid|pg||
nt|lestergold: but that doesnt mean its biddable|pg||
nt|roswolf: did south really bid 2nt?|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 6@C looks cold|pg||
nt|lestergold: less than 50%|pg||
nt|lestergold: but too good fro roland|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridge.is/results  -  running scores in all matches - Results|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Rob|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 2n must be very forcing!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well a trump lead is needed in defending @S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mariner1: so 3@H is the spot,,,,,,,|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: looks like 2/1|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam could well be bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: he started with 2 @C seems to me 2/nt  would be forcing  |pg||
pc|sT|nt|roswolf: i think finis|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: this should just come home......|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West will probably have to cope with a forcing defence. Won't be easy with trumps 4-1|pg||
pc|h6|nt|santyclz: Basically 5 is on 1 of 2 and reasonable breaks.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: oh well spade game - not as good as club game but no probs here|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4/1 spade break and club finesse wrong and this could go off where as you need sledgehammer to beat the club game|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Thanks that site is great|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|santyclz: Though a trump out might have made it tricky.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy to lead stiff trump IMO |pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|roswolf: not many sledgehammers in bridge clubs mike!|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mariner1: hard  to get to a minor suit slam when you have a 8 card major fit and less than|pg||
nt|mariner1: optimum count|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|sybarra: esp. when pard X'd @D |pg||
nt|lestergold: this is true Rob|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|lestergold: but lubs had been bid and supported|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: now viking axes maybe especially in Iceland|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mariner1: needed to use the @D as trumps and run them by S|pg||
nt|mariner1: now when he runs them he will lack an entry back to hand|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: doesn't know trumps are 4-1, but might suspect it. Here, ruffing looks obvious|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: so inj iceland they maybe have sledgehammers|pg||

nt|lestergold: they are all imposters no one names endin son|pg||
nt|sybarra: it's their first names |pg||
nt|mariner1: EW could even make 6@S here though not likely to be bid|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: ty shirley!|pg||
nt|mariner1: some end in dottir|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: i would be tempted to bid as west|pg||
nt|roswolf: as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Only one woman in this event and she is sitting out in this set. Ljósbrá is her name and she plays for Skeljungur|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Surnames are not used much in Iceland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The phone book is sorted by first names|pg||
nt|sybarra: now east might be tempted to bid |pg||
nt|yo_yo: what do you think East will respond to partner's 1@S?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: east must surely raise|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@D is a lot of temptation :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh raised a distance too far |pg||
nt|sybarra: well yes seems he did |pg||
nt|roswolf: should support but maybe that is a tad too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: two distances too far 3d the limit|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Yesterday in the JEC match we saw a case where in spite of his pd's x, Nevio lead a trump.  He was right.  Since I'm not of his class if pd makes a lead-directing x, I lead it.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some prefer to support immediately|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very difficult when you hold a void opposite partner's first bid suit  |pg||
nt|mariner1: W is considering 2@D or 3@S I think|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do you bid 2@C there?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: personally yes, but I can understand 2@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or 2@S?|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes I do,,,,, though 2@S not unreasonable|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mariner1: can N sit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and n/s looks to be a trick short in 4 @H |pg||
nt|roswolf: should pass the double - nowhere really to go|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe even 2 tricks |pg||
nt|lestergold: 4d preemptive enuf if anything but as it happens the 2 level is the limit for n/s|pg||
nt|mariner1: how are they in 5 of anything|pg||
nt|lestergold: every finesse wronmg for n/s but e/w have 4 top losers in their contract|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Guðmundur Páll Arnarson was a member of the Icelandic gold medal team (Bermuda Bowl) in 1991|pg||
nt|mariner1: since N has not already passed this worries me|pg||
nt|roswolf: while north thinks hope will flourish|pg||
nt|lestergold: rush of blood to east's head- he got busy.....very busy ..... much too busy....|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed rob|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|mariner1: N works it out|pg||
nt|roswolf: got it right!|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: he has an ace, that might be more that pard expects |pg||
nt|mariner1: 2 off anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: oh well  he caught up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: A10x and an ace-king is good opposite a jump rebid of 3@S - 4@D would not have been unreasonable |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but in all, far too difficult to bid this one, methinks |pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not safe at the 5 level.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: I think the 4 @D bid is ......? |pg||
nt|roswolf: east may not be amused at his pards shape and west will rue his pard's enterprise|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well to make 6  Jon would have to dispose of his @D|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|sybarra: or was that the "get out" bid?|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think the 4@d bid was forced, his pd was unlimited at that point.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: one goes on the @C|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: so what would 4 @H be?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Deny a @d control.|pg||
nt|roswolf: better|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and if he ruffs the others  he might be in a bit of danger|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: he's doing that now so we shall see|pg||

nt|roswolf: more fun here likely|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW have a slam, can they bid it,,,,,, should they?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: could he have set the @H up?|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to make N ruff in early to make 6|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: a bad slam but makeable mas cards lie|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: disposing of the fourth heart is a problem- slam canbe defeated by best defence|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: entry problems to west hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: this one is anti% even for me|pg||
nt|mariner1: and that would not be easy to find at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not sure you can finesse the @S and ruff the hearts |pg||
nt|roswolf: like the 3@H raise|pg||
nt|lestergold: east ios thinking of slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: and roland is there in the background nodding and encouraging him|pg||
nt|sybarra: east=our optimist |pg||
nt|roswolf: west has to back pedal now|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H showa better than a 4 @S call|pg||
nt|lestergold: west regrets having only three spades|pg||
nt|mariner1: E has a great hand in this auction|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: east  does not need his partner to have much of a takeout double to make slam|pg||
mb|3C|nt|roswolf: indeed but he mustn't hang pard for bidding|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is this what they call S*** stayman?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 5s all pass hopefully|pg||
nt|roswolf: dangerous|pg||
nt|sybarra: and here come the @D cue is my guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: what was west to bid? pard asked him ti bid his best suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: garbage :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or an outright psyche?|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice call opposite a weak NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: obviously more polite in the USA :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: it's ok - he can pass any response, and it's quite difficult for EW to double |pg||
mb|p|pc|h8|nt|mariner1: so EW miss a 3N here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and lo and behold, a vulnerable game missed|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: not much to this hand even with a of @S, @S lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: no here comes the sensible bid from east stopped just in time|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm have they survived|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Jon has that sinking feeling as he sees 9 tricks in NT|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so  a great bid from Hrolfur |pg||
nt|mdgraham: although West might have tried 3@S - 3@C is not necessarily a pre-balance here |pg||
nt|mdgraham: sorry, East|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I must add that to my system!|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|mariner1: timing very important here|pg||
pc|c8|nt|roswolf: yed declarer could easily go wrong|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|santyclz: My kind of hand, no finesses.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: duck!|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: north should duck|pg||
nt|lestergold: now return lub probably best attack entries|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|sybarra: club return sort of tangles E up |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but dd he can still emerge with 12 tricks|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: but may not be obvious when you can only see one other hand|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c5|nt|lestergold: deim not hurting declarer|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mariner1: I like weak NT though I raise to 12-15 when Vul and play transfers then|pg||
nt|mariner1: NV - 10 - 14 and two way staymen|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: if e/w can get into the auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: now they are in|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: when I do that, my pards alwasy leap in @D (or my short suit) |pg||
nt|lestergold: east hand example of a modern takeout double - the old days the experts would have held their heads in horror|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|mariner1: NS in 3N here I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: vey symmetric - 1@D on 7654 and 1@H on 7632|pg||
nt|mariner1: looking for 9th trick|pg||
mb|3D|an|.|mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|sybarra: so e/w got into the auction and out quickly and safely |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|roswolf: perhaps the italians would double in any era|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: "lets lead 4h from longest and stongest |pg||
nt|sybarra: then see what happens |pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: Shirely thats because you never hold partner's suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: in modern style 2s should guarantee 5 because they ahve to allow for doublers not necessarily having four cards in the majors not to mention point count|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant see a 9th trick|pg||
nt|mariner1: so the old can they get 9 before defense gets 5|pg||

nt|mariner1: well S opening and N DBL might warn EW|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|santyclz: (Except, of course, in the midnight swiss.)|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL  JOe |pg||
nt|sybarra: and it used to be in midnight swiss, you could have a beer or 2 at the table also |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n e/w best played by east|pg||
nt|roswolf: that looks a good raise bid by east|pg||
nt|mariner1: now EW have the 3N|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or a slam|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mdgraham: they have 6@D, too, on the lie|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 5d makes too|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 6@D makes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: all on the position of A@S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: west will be thibnking of game/slam maybe in dims|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S is just a cue here|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you opp passed hand maybe just game|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S is imaginative|pg||
nt|lestergold: this looks as if its going to the wrong denomination|pg||
nt|mariner1: W has to be worried, or should be worried, about S and N in auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: if east's majors had been reversed something nasty have happened|pg||
nt|lestergold: south produced quite an opener at red versus green|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3rd in hand etc etc:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not sure E can get to it now |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3c is technically right but i think the percntage bid by east is no trumps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, 2-2 trumps helps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Hermann will be interested with all his aces and kings|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no he isnt |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H would not have cost|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i suppose he thinks he's shown his hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Jon thinking now?|pg||
nt|mariner1: even a reverse by E of 2@H might have been better|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|lestergold: indeed but at unfavourable|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: colours - what relevance do they have nowadays!?|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe with such good hearts east should have bid them rather than unassuming cue bid but wasy after the event|pg||
nt|yo_yo: noooo i dislike reverses with 4/4  should be banned |pg||
nt|mariner1: many play that shows 5 4 though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wow, West has gone on|pg||
nt|yo_yo: my partner did it on me last weekend , nearly got to a slam with xxxx opp xxxx :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: well 5d - hts establish here dims 2/2 no real prob|pg||
nt|lestergold: even ten of clubs is right if you n eeded it|pg||
nt|santyclz: The w hand is still unlimited at that point, 3nt while practical gives up on slams since you have the @sa.  Without the ace, I'd agree.|pg||
nt|lestergold: u are right Joe|pg||
nt|lestergold: easy after the event|pg||
nt|lestergold: we are quadruple dummy of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: lead not unhelpful|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead makes it easy|pg||
nt|mariner1: if it doesn't work, don't do it :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: makeable on any lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: well understandable lead partner opened clubs vulnerable|pg||
nt|sybarra: S may think N has a singleton? |pg||
nt|roswolf: yyes but as declarer i like easy rides|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: still declarer has to do the work here|pg||

nt|sybarra: with ace of spades cash, S looking for a better signal from Pard |pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: NS need a NON- @D lead to make 4@H...... not that they will be in it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the other room found 3NT on 19 i see|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you have to decide on your own cue-bidding style, but it does seem that East turned down several opportunities to cue below game level. He had a very prime hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: well a @c and a @D switch also beats 4@H|pg||
mb|1H|nt|santyclz: Since s was "known" to have the q, ruffing high would be either careless or a great compliment to north.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: stayman or transfer?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well easy for e/w to get too high here|pg||
nt|roswolf: will 3nt be attemted here|pg||
nt|roswolf: attempted|pg||
nt|lestergold: it shouldnt be|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont mind missing slams which depend on the position of an ace|pg||
nt|yo_yo: trumps also had to break|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now do they play limit raises or bergen?|pg||
nt|mariner1: <--- not a bergen fan (or close)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: really?  Why not?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on that particular hand, yes. But generally, if you can show prime cards below game on what might be a slam auction, why not? |pg||
nt|yo_yo: I suppose it depends on your partner Mike|pg||
mb|2N|an|.|nt|yo_yo: If they are the type to bid slam at the whiff of an oily rag, then no|pg||

nt|mariner1: bidding room|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: nor can it be made either except by absurd double pin in dims|pg||

nt|lestergold: east was rock botom opener could raise an invite not even in junior bridge|pg||
nt|lestergold: not raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well this combo does not look too hot for e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: now that is tempting providence!|pg||

nt|mariner1: well this is about the lead, or lead and switch|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: 4th from longest and strongest again  |pg||

nt|lestergold: but of course ten or jack correct according to their methods|pg||

nt|lestergold: double dummy or inspired may make 3 but 4 has as much play as a bone surviving in front of my dog|pg||

nt|mariner1: 7 opposite 10 with a NT in between,,,,,, not my idea of game|pg||
mb|p|pc|h7|nt|lestergold: i think this is west's fault he is punishing his pard- the most he should have done was bid 2h to start and maybe ventured a raise of 2s no more than that- he actually did a valley ...|pg||
