nt|Walddk13: Because the closed room operator has not entered a result on board 1 which he missed|pg||

nt|olson: do both pairs  play a strong club ?|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@S should be off|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|lestergold: looks like another easy 3N|pg||
mb|d|nt|garnetts: Hard hand for east here--would love to pre-empt--but surely the wrong shape unless it shows hearts and a minor|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d!|nt|mmmakela: welcome all! hope the technical probs have been sorted out|pg||
nt|panja: it seems they do...|pg||
nt|fifee: muideburg style hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT makes for NS|pg||
mb|3H|nt|olson: yes|pg||
nt|fifee: now Karakolev is showing long @Ds|pg||
nt|garnetts: 500 best defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: 6NT for NS|pg||
nt|garnetts: lead singleton|pg||
nt|fifee: 6nt wont make|pg||
nt|garnetts: agreed unless west covers the Q@C |pg||
nt|fifee: unless East does not lead a @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: probably make ten tricks for another flattie|pg||
nt|fifee: right David|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: this is not a good bid by west surely|pg||
nt|fifee: Popov frustrated with all his values|pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugraphzkv: yes, they do.|pg||
nt|panja: this will be an interesting 3Nt|pg||
nt|olson: S will be endplayed at trick 1  into giving up a trick  |pg||
nt|panja: South must avoid a Club lead..|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: Andonov is thinking|pg||
nt|garnetts: East must be something like he is with longer diamonds so this makes no sense--if east is forced it will hurt|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: Bulgarian CS's semi, 2x20 boards|pg||
nt|wwalter: this could be expensive :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|olson: the best lead  is spade J  but this is impossible  |pg||
mb|p|nt|fifee: 6@C is on |pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure I would move as South---partner is almost marked with four hearts--otherwise west would have raised over 2@H |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Friederike from Germany|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello all.|pg||
nt|lestergold: if not bothering with dim finesse make more maybe|pg||
nt|fifee: east did well not to push them to 6|pg||
nt|garnetts: I also agree that 6@C will make --should make even --maybe North should bid it|pg||
nt|kippari: testi|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kippari: TX Roland|pg||
nt|maribelxx: Tervehdys kaikille!|pg||
pc|d5|nt|panja: well, @S8 or 6 will work fine|pg||
nt|olson: both D and H leads  pick up those suits|pg||
nt|olson: declarer should duck low spade lead  to the 10|pg||
nt|maribelxx: Lupasin hetken teitä häiritä :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|panja: ideally, the 6/5 rather|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|kippari: jaossa 1 Arttu sai kaikki tikit seifti-pelinviennillään,hyvin pelattu|pg||
pc|d8|nt|wwalter: this should be 1 down|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|olson: declarer  has some work  to do|pg||
nt|panja: North should have ducked @HQ|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|olson: D a  play makes  it easy now|pg||
nt|olson: yes|pg||
nt|fifee: with such a square hand, I would not bid 6 with north hand either on this auction|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|garnetts: with four aces and the spade finesse marked ?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now 1st maj finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: will make the rest i think|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|olson: ducking H Q  is best  since  N knows  H  4/2  and  declarer  has the  K|pg||
nt|panja: North seems to be in a hurry, in these situations where tenaces are everywhere, patience pays|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||

mb|4S|mb|d|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benislovas: Saulis (the best Lithuanian player) - Lukinskas and Jankauskas - Poska for Soho|pg||

nt|danilo1: Good morning all|pg||
mb|1H|nt|panja: another misfit hand|pg||
nt|olson: 4h  is the likely spot|pg||
nt|fifee: 4@H is on here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|wwalter: gm Danielo|pg||
nt|wwalter: sry Danilo|pg||
nt|kippari: mitähän systeemiä kukakin siellä pelaa|pg||
nt|kaapo: Kaukon 2@D 8-11 ja 5+@D|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: we keep getting dull 3n hands|pg||
nt|danilo1: is that real?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.bridge.bg/en_UK/ranking60.html  for standing|pg||
nt|panja: and @D lead should beat that..but is unlikely|pg||
nt|olson: 3h seems an underbid  unless forcing|pg||
mb|2S|nt|wwalter: Silvia?|pg||
nt|garnetts: I like 2@H now |pg||
nt|garnetts: Not 1@H |pg||
mb|3H|nt|tweety1: hello everybody|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome back to Veysel|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 6 clubs worth trying?|pg||
nt|tweety1: yhis going to be a tough game|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This looks like a 3nt for E/W, but there will be some complications if they get @h lead.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: wlc back, Veysel|pg||
nt|garnetts: the good major cards swing it for me|pg||
nt|garnetts: But they got there|pg||
nt|kippari: entä vastustajat|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: can lose 2 h and 2 dims thats all|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Depends on how it is played.|pg||
nt|lestergold: would have to play it badly not to make|pg||
nt|olson: 4s will not do well   so ew did well not to save|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|olson: this should be easy now  |pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: waw ... |pg||
nt|garnetts: This about the Q@S which will not be hard to locate--since North will be marked with the A@D ---and South opened|pg||
nt|fifee: declarer needs to ruff 2@D or find the @SQ|pg||
nt|kaapo: Välitarjouksen ansiosta löytyi hyvä lähtö|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: should E taken a 4 @D cue? |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|sybarra: or a 4 @H cue?|pg||
nt|mmmakela:  E shd bid 4 @C, can still stop in 4 NT if W loaded in dias|pg||
nt|kaapo: Mutta tikkejä on silti piisalle|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|sybarra: I think E should take another call (maybe easy from here) I am just not sure what call it should be|pg||
pc|h3|pc|dT|pg||
nt|lestergold: well north can establish that heart but never cash it|pg||
nt|baldfriede: No entry to the 4th @h.|pg||
nt|wwalter: they will find out the basic sistem :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
nt|garnetts: The defence should stay with @D but they nearly always switch|pg||
nt|garnetts: I cannot see any point is cashing the A@C |pg||
nt|fifee: dummy reversal the easiest line from here. sluffing the @S9 and ruffing a @S to establish the suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: Must be thinking of that or ruffing two diamonds |pg||
pc|h5|nt|panja: no ruff now|pg||
nt|kippari: näin on|pg||
nt|kaapo: Eestiläiset pelaavat jonkin sortin Ranna ruutua|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|panja: against, too fast to play a @D to discard another...|pg||
nt|olson: S should have started  trumps  after the  favorable  club lead|pg||
nt|panja: trumps had to be removed before...but now..I guess all is well|pg||
nt|olson: the defenders will not let him ruff a spade  in that dummy|pg||
nt|panja: again, difficult to see why East ducked|pg||
pc|d9|nt|danilo1: still early I guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: Popov saw PASS from his Partner|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|h7|pc|s8|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|vugraphzkv: smoking break|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is going to take a while if they stop every three boards to attempt suicide  ( in the long run at least)|pg||
nt|fifee: :)  bridge players habit |pg||
nt|garnetts: Maybe you are right Patty|pg||
nt|fifee: when smoking was still allowed at our club, sometimes you could not see from one end of the room to the other :)|pg||

nt|Walddk5: This is a round-robin semi-final among 8 teams. 7 matches of 20 boards over three days|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is a lot of bds|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 9@d makes the day.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: sure :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: a break from the monotony of 3n|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Jon Sveindal from Norway|pg||
nt|panja: well, I should think that without @SA with West......there is simply not 3@S bid|pg||
nt|olson: E needs to count to 4 winners  to  beat the hand  and he knows  they are not getting a club  |pg||
nt|garnetts: looks a bit like 2@S all pass to me|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: a thin 4s looking like it shouild make if they bid it|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi all|pg||
nt|panja: this is another interesting hand..NS are missing 3 Aces..|pg||
nt|kippari: 3x3NT aloitettu|pg||
nt|kaapo: Tikkimäärä on laskussa|pg||
nt|kippari: tikit vähenee peli peliltä|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|sybarra: E may back in later? or wil S bid 5 @D?|pg||
nt|wwalter: good was not in red :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: Hi, Jon :)|pg||
nt|panja: 26 HCP..they will just about make 3Nt because SQ is in|pg||
nt|kaapo: Tosin nyt taitaa olla paljon tikkej|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: ä|pg||
mb|2H|nt|danilo1: eventual overbid by West or East may be dangerous ... slam may be tried by partner than|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: But if they bid 3nt it's unlikely to be monotonous.|pg||
nt|lestergold: lose 2h and a dim |pg||
nt|lestergold: true!|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: 16 seems ok for a srtong 1 @c?|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the spade fit land dim singleton with east makes this and an unlikely candidate for 3n|pg||
nt|danilo1: as it is happening ... East will probably try slam now|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is the drawback of the multi--North should double now I think--partner is marked with spade length|pg||
nt|garnetts: IF west started with 2@S I doubt North would bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: South must deceide between pass and 4@H|pg||
nt|garnetts: Pass looks a better bet as it is almost certain to go plus|pg||
nt|fifee: or 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 4 tricks in @H, 3 in some minor, two in @S...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: this can be -1   |pg||
nt|panja: of course he could steal one more in other minor..|pg||
nt|fifee: likely to be some ruffing at a suit contract|pg||
nt|kippari: tässä luulisi silti riittävän|pg||
nt|maribelxx: virolaisilla on omansa, siellä merikotka jo pesii http://www.looduskalender.ee/en/node/2909|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: quickly or slowly |pg||
nt|wwalter: thay play prec, so under 15|pg||
nt|jbgood: som spade contract coming up? 4 is good - but the club split and the spade loser makes it very difficult|pg||
nt|garnetts: He will probably place his partner with four hearts|pg||
pc|dK|nt|danilo1: well, ad only 1 more Hcp (@CA instead K) and ... lay down (could be even 7)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: the hand has tlo be managed competently to ensure ten winners|pg||
nt|santyclz: I hate to lead the suit of a splinter, but everything else looks worse here.|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ristit vähän vinossa|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: with ace of dims onside that should not prove to be too much of a problem|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially with the lead!!|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi Silvia:)|pg||
nt|maribelxx: ja vasemmalla on linkki kotkaTV, jonka takaa löytyy videoklippejä (niissä ei pimeys haittaa :) )|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: no -2 if the carding is read well |pg||
nt|mmmakela: could've been -2|pg||
nt|garnetts: Interesting choice of lead--it is usually considered best when you have a trump stack to lead a long suit to shorten declarer|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: mind you every lead would help dclarer ex cept for a tump|pg||
nt|danilo1: maybe same lead in 6 :)|pg||
nt|wwalter: even so 12 tricks :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: not pleasant time for South now ... any card may be trick now ... |pg||
nt|danilo1: ... he is happy now opps stopped in Game|pg||
nt|kippari: 6Nt järjestyy kyllä helposti|pg||
nt|kaapo: 4NT taisi olla kvantti|pg||

pc|hT|nt|danilo1: Good morning Boian|pg||

nt|wwalter: this is better than 6@c , down :)|pg||
nt|panja: they need to find out @D weakness though, and typically, methods tell you only about Major controls|pg||
nt|garnetts: Normally that would show Dummy's first bid suit--and a decent hand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tweety1: so that N can describe his hand better|pg||
nt|jbgood: I wonder if 2 NT would be forcing?|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: nothing wrong with souths bid- everything wrong with north's accdeptance|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: 6d on the NS cards looks like a pretty good contract|pg||
nt|tweety1: which cannot be bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: being endplayed for a vulnerable game hurts - especially when you could have avoided the endplay|pg||
nt|fifee: 4@H a likely spot|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|santyclz: 5 or 7 hand, can they diagnose it?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Difficult to bid it, and off if K@d wrongsided.|pg||
nt|ppilot: dont think they will find clubs and if find at bad level|pg||
nt|danilo1: what should be 3@C by South? |pg||
nt|ppilot: now popov as i know him will try 3 nt:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: :)|pg||
nt|ppilot: 3 diamond means pass or corect|pg||
nt|danilo1: if so agressive both, Dble is even more dangerous|pg||
nt|ppilot: limit 3 diamonds and ready for more at clubs|pg||
nt|panja: South should simply bid 4@S....and he did..good|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes--I think I prefer 2@S to 2@H  if were going to bid--in practice I would pass i think|pg||
nt|kaapo: Magicin 1@C|pg||
mb|4S|nt|garnetts: Yes--not the worse slam I have ever seen but the trump break makes things awkward--needs care in game |pg||
nt|fifee: the pre empt makes it hard to find though|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: south has heard the slam try and has 3 bullets!|pg||
nt|tweety1: 4 @d or 4@h ?|pg||
nt|ppilot: hard for popov now:)|pg||
nt|danilo1: guess so, 3@C would be also pass/corr ... thk enough to bid 3@C, after all, it is free bid|pg||
nt|wwalter: in the first 2 rounds they made 49 VP from a posible 50 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|wwalter: this is also strange|pg||
nt|olson: ew are playing  negative free bids   2h  was not forcing  |pg||
nt|kaapo: 12-16 epätasainen käsi tai 15-17 tasainen|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@D joko 0-7 tai 12+|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: Oops.|pg||
nt|lestergold: er em|pg||
nt|lestergold: perhaps 4d wasnt forcing in south's opinionm maybe just competitive|pg||
nt|lestergold: onviouslhy north must have inbtended it as forcing|pg||
pc|cA|nt|baldfriede: It looks as if N did not communicate his hand correctly.|pg||

nt|vugraphzkv: a little break after the board|pg||
nt|rhelle: but on this lead it will|pg||
nt|jbgood: absolutely|pg||
nt|rhelle: I guess it needed a @h lead to defeat it - impossible to find|pg||
nt|olson: W would need to double  1s  to set up a forcing sequence|pg||
nt|olson: or cue bid  |pg||
nt|panja: there is a very small window for that negative free bid to work....more useful in Prec..narrow range opening systems..|pg||

pc|cA|nt|lestergold: just in case there is a hole in one of the black suits|pg||
nt|jbgood: should really be a big takeout 3 @h|pg||
nt|daman: this contract will be tough to make|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5 min won't fair but 3 nt has chance|pg||
nt|panja: y, not enough strength to bid any game..|pg||
nt|panja: @DT from JT9..I guess it promises Jack..|pg||
pc|c9|nt|tweety1: needs to duck the 1st @s to make.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|ppilot: as it can be seen luck is with the brave|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@C by South is much better bid than 3@S ... he is limited in precision, and hand is very good, esp. since 1S should be 5+|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT has 2 chances....slim and none|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ppilot: wonder how much time this will last ? no duplication at all and still many stones to be made|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mmmakela: good lead director bid, needs to duck 1st|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mmmakela: and guess hearts|pg||
nt|tweety1: and also 2-4 leads are common too.|pg||
nt|rhelle: ouch ... why didn't south introduce his @d?|pg||
nt|rhelle: clearly didn't get the meaning of 3@h|pg||
nt|jbgood: strange he didnt want to play the 9 card trump fit..|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not with 3-lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: welll declarer will have a high blood pressure momwent shortly when he leads a dim from dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think e will have at least a mini tank and then run the dim in any case|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kippari: ruutulähdöllä ne on syytä nopeasti ottaakin|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|lestergold: next time someone will lead their singleton holding Kx dims!!|pg||
nt|rhelle: but if North ducks 1 round of @h, he should get a fair way here|pg||
nt|daman: now return a @H and duck|pg||
nt|daman: then it is 2 down|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
nt|garnetts: Chance of a reverse Grovesnor Coup  here--drop the Q@H under the A@H --the grovesnor coup involves playing the Q from qJx to annoy declarer|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|tweety1: @h ace must be in S to make.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Martin Garvey|pg||
nt|olson: S should  switch  to the  Jack of H   |pg||
pc|h4|nt|jbgood: if N has a 2 suiter - she would have bid the second duit directly - I think - so she must have @d also. Perhaps a redouble of 3 NT would have made it crearer to S|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, I think you're right, Jon|pg||
nt|rhelle: maybe South thought that 3@h just showed a very strong hand, and after 3@c a monster 2-suiter|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@c, sorry|pg||
nt|rhelle: which is not unreasonable|pg||
nt|rhelle: but a XX over 3NT would clear it up|pg||
nt|rhelle: now North has blocked the @d suit|pg||
nt|jbgood: is this really how the @d suit has been played? The 6?|pg||
nt|rhelle: this is not going to go well|pg||
nt|jbgood: depends on what team you are rooting for..|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes ... I am impartial, so I'm just looking from declarer's perspective|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: Danailov is thinking|pg||
nt|rhelle: and I unserstand why. Is he going to try and cut down on @c ruffs by returning a trump, or trying to get declarer trump short?|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps he thinks that N is 6-4 in the blacks (as S may think too)|pg||
nt|thegarve:  afternoon|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|tweety1: blocked|pg||
nt|lestergold: phew|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Congrats on the Camrose win. Great stuff!|pg||
nt|daman: Popov has decided to let them make this one|pg||

nt|danilo1: probable will make 9|pg||

nt|jbgood: one forced spade ruff is enough to give defense 2 trump tricks in 5 @d - |pg||
nt|garnetts: You are kidding me :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure how South managed the double though|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tweety1: we say 'playing under the table' :)|pg||

pc|c7|nt|jbgood: I am surprised E didnt bid ..|pg||
nt|thegarve:  many would not play 2@d as natural - worked well here|pg||
nt|daman: most Bulgarians play precision|pg||
nt|daman: so 2@D might always be natural|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|tweety1: N wld bid 4 @d  if S bid 4 'c.|pg||

nt|ppilot: if they bid with like that playing later agg me will tear us into pieses:)|pg||
nt|danilo1: but guess, since 1NT ... will play safety ... @S10 from the table|pg||
nt|thegarve:  wonder why so many play strong @c?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: asm soon as north shows sign of life south will drive there- i think this was lazy bidding bu south|pg||
nt|rhelle: well, it's all academic now. I fins South 2@h bid with 9 points in partner's suits very timid|pg||
nt|kippari: jos tää lupas ruutuja ja kortteja niin ...|pg||
nt|kaapo: Onkohan NS:llä Lebensohl käytössä|pg||

pc|h2|nt|mmmakela: 3 spades makes w right guesses|pg||

nt|ppilot: nothing dangerous so will make lot of trick 1 im is 1 imp why miss it:)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|thegarve:  in Bulgaria you could call it "natural" as so many play strong @c|pg||
nt|mmmakela: why not, good sys playing teams|pg||

nt|panja: difficult to attribute fault to that lead..|pg||

pc|c9|nt|mmmakela: yes if 15 upper limit|pg||

nt|lestergold: 2n response by east in the other room was the bonkers bid of the day sorry week maybe year|pg||

nt|garnetts: :)|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|ppilot: break nothing interesting here|pg||

nt|tweety1: promissed a misclick|pg||

mb|p|nt|tweety1: hmm|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok 13-16|pg||
nt|tweety1: do EW play multi then?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so 1 @S must be 9-14 or alike|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 9-12|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: not multi|pg||
nt|tweety1: so how do they bid their weak 2s then pls?|pg||
nt|tweety1: yes, it is getting more and more fashinable.|pg||
nt|tweety1: even the 5 card Maj  doesnt need to be that weah:)|pg||
nt|danilo1: East should maybe try Dble ... if not penalty ... 4!NT (if 4@DS Dble pen) I would not|pg||
nt|lestergold: now a more viable 4h available for e/w|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: hm i predict 3n by west down 1|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: weak|pg||
nt|garnetts: Might panic perhaps and allow the 10@S to make |pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: or spades|pg||

nt|maribelxx: Sen verran vauhdikasta on ollut, että vähiin käy nämäkin jaot :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: not sure we know |pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: and poor West ... countein his @SK ... still, I agree with east's (unlucky) Dble|pg||
nt|ppilot: the other pair of ilko gains imp after imp on overtricks but need a lot of such hands to recover:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: but probably a push|pg||
nt|jbgood: a question of cashing the spades|pg||
nt|daman: on a @C lead you need to find the @Ss|pg||
nt|daman: same in either contract|pg||
nt|thegarve:  must have been confident of 4-card @S not to investigate|pg||
nt|mmmakela: guess play 4c majs|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed u have more time to explore in a heart contract not that declarer is likely t pick up enuf info to make the right guess|pg||
nt|thegarve:  4@h is bettear as you can make a few discovery plays if @H are 3-2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well must have had a friendly defence in open room|pg||
nt|thegarve:  make the @S guess straight way in the open room|pg||
nt|lestergold: in 4h you will discover that south has the doubleton heart and u may therefore play south for three spades|pg||
nt|thegarve:  you can discover that south has KQ@C and did not open the bidding|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and a@d|pg||
nt|daman: a @C lead is the best|pg||
nt|lestergold: well jack of spades most likely to be placed on distributional considerations rather than as a high card placement|pg||
nt|lestergold: still all academical|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 4@H löytynee|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mmmakela: 3-level I guess|pg||
nt|tweety1: dont think so:)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so they pass them because 1 @S could be even (7)8-12 maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: they don't have weak 2|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|nt|ppilot: that is why i like andonov bid it drove to gain|pg||
nt|lestergold: easy if they are playing udca|pg||
nt|lestergold: kill point coming|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|tweety1: too mant rubish HPs in NS hand.|pg||
nt|tweety1: many|pg||
pc|d9|nt|baldfriede: Yes, would have been better to let E/W play in 3@h.|pg||
nt|lestergold: pure guess |pg||
nt|kaapo: NS:lla ei taida olla halpaa uhrausta|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: with the dim suit in dummy, there are limited defensive options|pg||
nt|garnetts: The defence have given themselves an outside chnace|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jbgood: wouldnt the 2 be better then?|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: they are obviously not playing udca|pg||
nt|kippari: Valta-Utter tarjosi 6NT +2 imppiä Suomelle|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: he has comitted himself to the right guess|pg||
nt|fifee: Andonov has great instincts|pg||
nt|garnetts: The 9@S is right form us seeing and in with the odds too|pg||
nt|kippari: siis jako 4|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ppilot: shall he make safety play of clubs or play for overtrick?|pg||
nt|daman: one-way finesse|pg||
nt|garnetts: also it wouldn't have been right to bid 4@S without the 9@S would it?  :)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|danilo1: safety is safety ... he does it |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: probably because he was in dummy and that was the most convenient play|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|tweety1: hard with that many @ds|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mmmakela: 1st imp coming EW way?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|kippari: no,ylivoima jaossa olis kuitenkin ollut|pg||
nt|kaapo: Slammisaumaa NS:lla|pg||
mb|1H|nt|tweety1: EW has 5 @c / @d while NS has 4 @h|pg||
nt|jbgood: a trivial 4@h coming up - unless EW want to hand out some imps by "saving" in spades|pg||
nt|daman: EW are outplaying NS so far|pg||
nt|thegarve:  smoking break or has Guirov gone to get a knife?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  or an umbrella....|pg||
mb|1N|nt|tweety1: 4 @s |pg||
nt|tweety1: i mean|pg||
nt|viren169: a thin opening... |pg||
nt|olson: if south shows a GF hand  North may drive  to  6s|pg||
nt|kaapo: @d-kupiin vähintäänkin kaatuisi|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: I doubt E/W will land in game here.|pg||

mb|p|nt|baldfriede: Though this bid might change the scenario.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I retact my statement.|pg||

nt|olson: this should slow N down and play 4s  |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: well 8 tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not my idea of a 3@D bid--too much defence|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ppilot: i like this opening|pg||

pc|c5|nt|viren169: Now 9 tricks will be wrapped up quickly... |pg||

nt|mmmakela: 3343 W isn't that strong so I'd pass 2 spades|pg||
pc|c4|nt|olson: looking at XX  in H|pg||
nt|ppilot: wonder since both teams dont need victory to continue next why they play with so many tactical bids and risky desisions?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ppilot: must be something personel or just ego:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I Boian they are through anyway?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tweety1: this set of bids seemed smart to me.|pg||
nt|tweety1: and a good sacrifice by NS|pg||

nt|kaapo: Joten Virolle vähän lisää kaulaa|pg||

mb|p|nt|ppilot: 7 @H and 7nt here but they may find @S fit|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@C will avoid the spade fit...|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a plot by the bulgarian secret police |pg||
nt|thegarve:  as a youth 3NT always seemed to make on no values|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: 1 nt?  :)|pg||
nt|ppilot: not sure |pg||
nt|jbgood: partscore (battle not likely)|pg||

nt|daman: Frankie Avalon|pg||

mb|d|nt|daman: I can't wait to be your age to find out martin|pg||
nt|thegarve:  must have opened 1@c?|pg||
nt|lestergold: uve a long way to go George|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@H is a reasonable spot for NS but hard to bid |pg||
nt|kaapo: Mites tässä 4@S?|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|sybarra: 2 @C, pick another suit pard?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or?|pg||
nt|lestergold: south's hand is not everyone's idea of an overcall with  two qxx holdings|pg||
nt|lestergold: will this psyche profit e/w?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ppilot: adio grand|pg||
nt|thegarve:  like Cliff Richard the eternal teenager|pg||
nt|kippari: saas nähdä meneekö 4S himaan?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mmmakela: think I've never witnessed 20 boards without scoring a single imp other team(this is not a curse,hoping the opposite)|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry I do not know the system|pg||
nt|garnetts: That is a poor bid--why not 3@C which makes 4@H unmakeable on that lead |pg||
nt|fifee: 4@H may be hard to make with east holding 4 pieces|pg||
nt|fifee: tapping declarer from the beginning with a @C lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: exactly which is why 3@C was a better choice |pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Now they will end up in the wrong suit...|pg||
nt|ppilot: ilko feels robbed:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I like his bid|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: south is very lucky here|pg||
nt|jbgood: hasnt been so far in the match - and 3 @c is beyond me:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: on a bad day this would be doubled and booked for something like a couple off against nothing|pg||
nt|lestergold: u Martin about 50 odd going on about 15?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  i'm at least 10 years younget than mike|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: me im only 18 so ur 8|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: NS will be in 4 @s|pg||
nt|tweety1: that is really hard to make|pg||
nt|viren169: they should find Q@S is missing and only a 4-4 fit ending in 6@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3c is a horrfiic bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: well they have arrived |pg||
nt|ppilot: good bids unhappy but let us see the lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: a@S here makes 4@H easy |pg||
nt|ppilot: that is why 3 clubs values +fit is better|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes I agree|pg||
nt|garnetts: but maybe it still gets beaten if a club swicth happens|pg||
nt|garnetts: switch even|pg||
nt|garnetts: any red suit lead and it makes |pg||
nt|ppilot: makable after spade and club|pg||
nt|fifee: :)|pg||
nt|ppilot: will discard dymmyes clubs on spade|pg||
nt|ppilot: but wall on open cards for us all is easy here:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I bet East is cursing now--for not bidding clubs|pg||
pc|h2|nt|baldfriede: Yes, very hard|pg||
nt|ppilot: wonder if they get to right level:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: with a typical NT hand S sh be happy to pass - unless 2 NT meant something else..|pg||
nt|thegarve:  your as young as the woman you feel, as they say|pg||
pc|hT|nt|fifee: I still think that a @C lead sets it|pg||
nt|kaapo: Puolustus voisi saada 2 @C ja punaiset ässät|pg||
nt|kippari: jos ristiä ei aukaista niin 10 tikkiä|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|viren169: tough to reach 7 when the spade fit is found...|pg||
nt|maribelxx: pitäis lähteä sillä|pg||
nt|kippari: 10|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I see no way to make it.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Rob Brown|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi All|pg||
nt|garnetts: Still if what you said is right earlier he will find a way to blame his partner|pg||
nt|ppilot: makes now|pg||
nt|ppilot: but let us see the line he will chose|pg||
nt|fifee: @C now can tap declarer and in with the @D and tap again|pg||
nt|garnetts: west is still not happy about the next lead--a club is far from obvious|pg||
nt|ppilot: 2 rounds of clubs ruf 2 spades discarding clubs from dummy and ace and diamond|pg||
nt|garnetts: He expects his partner to hold four trumps for his bid--maybe five|pg||
nt|fifee: yes the @SAce killed defense|pg||
nt|kippari: 11|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: ha to lkose three dims or two dims and a ruff to go offin 2s?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  needs to plan how to make 3@d tricks in defence, locking declarer in hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: on that basis martin i can assure u that im a lot younger than u but dont tell my wife|pg||
nt|maribelxx: ellei tule kuppia...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|thegarve:  nice one mike your wife doesn't know but thousands on BBO|pg||
nt|lestergold: my wife doesnt kniow any bbo members except me and david and in any case i would  claim i was lying to show off|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Mike was a teacher in his youth|pg||
nt|lestergold: and in my early middle age too|pg||
nt|thegarve:  taught Tom Townsend|pg||
nt|lestergold: i was a headmaster! hah|pg||
pc|dA|nt|olson: overtrick n ow|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|baldfriede: There seems to be a loser in each suit.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H might have been a better spot, how to avoid 4@S is not easy to see|pg||
pc|h4|nt|viren169: Safe spot!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: 7NT|pg||
nt|viren169: Usually 4-4 fits will generate an extra trick... but not here! |pg||
nt|lestergold: bit of a hurry with his dim ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: didnt teach him much as you can see didnt teach him how to beat u in a camrose|pg||
nt|ppilot: still declare needs to find the winning line|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: just keep pouring beer down ur throat at every opportuinity |pg||
nt|maribelxx: mutta ei kait sitä ehdi|pg||
pc|h9|nt|thegarve:  but it was watered down|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|jbgood: spade and another heart now|pg||
nt|garnetts: Now he does --but not too hard I think|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|mmmakela: easy 11|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mariner1: of course 4@H only has chance due to 3 3 @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: very friendly defence aces played on air all over the place|pg||
nt|jbgood: and a second trump trick coming..|pg||
nt|garnetts: In fact it is obvious |pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|baldfriede: No good discard for declarer.|pg||
mc|9|nt|viren169: At a high level... it is better to play in good suits...|pg||

nt|ppilot: bad vuln :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 5c a bit of an underbid with a stiff heart and a massive trick source|pg||
nt|thegarve:  bid 4@C - the suit below the one that you have - hear a 4@H response and ...play there|pg||

mb|p|nt|mmmakela: Shato on scoreboard!|pg||
nt|ppilot: this vulnerability i find it ok|pg||
nt|viren169: Assuming 2@S is weak... it will be difficult for pd to judge later in the auction on other hands.|pg||
nt|lestergold: east presumably said thx for the info i want to play 4h|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s a little more awkward|pg||

nt|garnetts: A number of players play a more constructive weak two via a multi|pg||

nt|vitold: in case it was not dbl with special meaning|pg||
nt|bobholl: agree direct X is better :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|benislovas: direct X shows either strong or @S with minor|pg||
nt|benislovas: but he has @S and a minor|pg||
nt|vitold: modernism:)))|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|bobholl: always 5 in the minor ?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|nt|benislovas: deal where old fashion works :)|pg||
nt|benislovas: not sure|pg||
mc|8|nt|benislovas: maybe at this vul|pg||
nt|benislovas: thanks all|pg||
nt|benislovas: we will resume soom|pg||
nt|bobholl: see you then :) |pg||

nt|thegarve:  maybe East should have bid 5@h?|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe east will be looking for a new partner|pg||
nt|thegarve:  i've heard Mike sing - like Sinatra|pg||
nt|lestergold: east with his ax of spade had no reason to bid at the 5 level|pg||
nt|olson: 3n for  3w|pg||
nt|olson: EW|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is a wicked hand|pg||
nt|kippari: kattokaas joku|pg||
nt|kaapo: Näemmä tämä jako vielä pelataan|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Toinen huone on vissiin missannut sen|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: and u dont need a hearing aid a sa result?|pg||
nt|daman: the perils of multi|pg||
mb|d|nt|mmmakela: merciful|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: smoking break after this board|pg||
nt|thegarve:  sorry Mike am tone deaf|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|viren169: I was wondering if N would open this! |pg||
nt|olson: perhaps  W can bid  2n  to show  6c and a max  |pg||
nt|garnetts: hmmmmmmmmmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|olson: or 3c  is 6c and a minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: this may get them too high|pg||
nt|viren169: Now they will get too high...|pg||
nt|viren169: 2N? without a spade stop?|pg||
nt|ppilot: happyly non vulnerable and not doubled:)|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@H?|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a bad shot at this vulnerbaiity|pg||
nt|lestergold: only one off against cold 5C|pg||
nt|olson: hand is in the middle range for  11 - 15  |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tweety1: what wld N's 1nt over 1 'd mean by any chance?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not if they finmd spade ruff|pg||
nt|jbgood: will perhaps find it against 6?|pg||
nt|lestergold: too much space taken west with no aces or singletons is not bidding any sixes|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps pass (forcing) is debatable when you know prd doesnt have a positive hand?|pg||
nt|olson: now  easy  3n by W  and should make 4   or   5 on spade leads|pg||
pc|s3|nt|viren169: wow!!!!!!!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|viren169: pass... not an option opposite an opening!|pg||
nt|ppilot: i am amazed too good parnership understanding|pg||
nt|ppilot: nte good news is 4 spades cant be made too:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: East getting his own back from earlier |pg||
nt|kaapo: Moni väri on kiltisti tässä jaossa|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|sybarra: fairly agressive |pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe they have a systemic meaning for a direct 1N over the 1@D (possibly short or|pg||
nt|mariner1: artificial not sure)|pg||
nt|jbgood: amazing - they dont play presicion they way I used to do - pass not forcing?|pg||
nt|lestergold: would they have beaten 5c? a heart lead and a spade switch?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  slam has play|pg||
nt|lestergold: if u are tone deasf then how do u know i cant sing|pg||
nt|garnetts: club is best for sure |pg||
nt|kippari: täällä sanotaan että otettu valtit pois mutta onhan saatavissa 2 herttatikkiä|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: but likely to make now?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mmmakela: 18-20 N|pg||
pc|s8|nt|tweety1: so dbl  is instead of 1 nt then?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Maybe Raptor.|pg||
nt|mariner1: the DBL here probably shows @D lenght|pg||
nt|jbgood: E would be declarer - di is good enough - in on heart ace and a spade ruff|pg||
nt|daman: same auction in the other room|pg||
nt|garnetts: clearly a singleton |pg||
nt|garnetts: unless playing low from xx|pg||
nt|ppilot: that is true they play small from xx|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have never though it was a good idea and now I know it isn't |pg||
nt|garnetts: Maybe they should lead singletons with their left hand--that would do it|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|starkist: 27 hcp|pg||
nt|thegarve:  I said that you sing like Sinatra|pg||
nt|lestergold: he couldnt sing|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Sinatra is my cat|pg||
nt|lestergold: not compared to Jose Carerras at any rate|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: hi all |pg||
pc|h5|nt|tweety1: then 3 @s seeems an overbid|pg||
nt|viren169: It is a big call... |pg||
nt|viren169: They must have been having lessons from the Hackett boys!|pg||
nt|ppilot: this is also style playing light openings|pg||
nt|viren169: North will be very happy with the developments!|pg||
nt|olson: good swicth  to save an imp  |pg||
nt|olson: hi|pg||
pc|h2|nt|garnetts: Mind I think it would need to be alerted |pg||
nt|ppilot: 3 hands diif:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: that is the end of the defence |pg||
nt|ppilot: and if 4 spades are deffended well not big win|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|viren169: tough to choose between the lines...|pg||
nt|viren169: best not to touch the trumps just yet|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: of course im asleep|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mmmakela: needs the 9th somewhere|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s very easy espcially on that lead prob make 6|pg||
pc|c4|nt|baldfriede: Really @h discard?|pg||
nt|mariner1: only the @D break beats 4@S here|pg||
nt|olson: s  played  W  to hold a spade stopper and knew  6c  and  2d|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed it gives declarer a small problem|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mariner1: well S did come in freely and N does have good hand|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well maybe 5 6 maybe too much work|pg||
nt|daman: maybe Mike sings like one of these guys     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMVxzEueJ6A|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|c5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: me singing is not a thing of beauty - even my bridge is better than m ysinging|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|mariner1: of course it also beats 3@S|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: maybe lightner  double for a spade lead!li|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|lestergold:  cash club ace cross ruff|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|tweety1: @d lead made things hard.|pg||
nt|ppilot: easy overtick now|pg||
nt|viren169: still work to be done yet...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|viren169: Declarer will not know the @Hs are 3-3|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|lestergold: now best to play for a cross ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer better make sure he doesnt run hinmself short lof tricks|pg||
mc|8|nt|kaapo: Koistisen pöytä pelaa yleensä nopeasti|pg||
