nt|jbgood: good morning:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: morning Jon :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Gary, Jon|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Frank|pg||
mb|1D|nt|frankaus: actual margin is 7.5 imps - just in case it gets real close we need to remember that|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: g'day|pg||
nt|frankaus: 6@H |pg||
nt|jbgood: Hello all - a poweful start to this 3rd session|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kiwibridge: almost 6@H here but not quite|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: North may not have a weak-2@D available (and even if he does, 3@D is more fun)|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: normal weak-2@D isn't so popular in Australia|pg||
nt|petergill: My team lost to this Del'monte Team in the Grand Final of the SNOT (Spring Nationals Open Teams) six months ago. |pg||
mb|3S|nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|athene: well, without the 3@D bid declarer might have tried for a diamond ruff in dummy as the tenth trick|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|patricck: isn't so popular is a bit of an understatement.....anyone opening a weak 2@D down here would be a rarity :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we remember it well :(|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl = Support Dbl (three @H's) 3@S weak, rest obvious|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi Peter:)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|petergill: Henry Christie is thinking about a slam|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kiwibridge: as you might|pg||
nt|petergill: Hughes - Christie are not a regular partnership, so North (as I would) might think 4@C is natural, not a cue bid. |pg||
mb|d|an|penalties|nt|petergill: I think he will remove to 5@H|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl = penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he can still hope that north has the @SJ|pg||
mb|4N|nt|jbgood: pass from n would show a spade control?|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 4NT RKCB - but for clubs or hearts???|pg||
mb|5C|nt|petergill: Depends on whether 4@C was natural or not|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|jbgood: not much in the play |pg||
nt|petergill: 5@c = one KC for @h, on same wavelength, well done|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: Welcome to the first segment of this semifinal for the Australian seniors championship|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 4NT RKCB (1430) for @h|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|petergill: 11 tricks unless @DJ is covered - it shouldn't be|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|jbgood: still a di and a spade loser|pg||
nt|petergill: Henry Christie is from Perth in Western Australia - Nigel Rosendorff tells me that Henry is the best player in WA, but most of us think that Nigel is. :) |pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|athene: well, a 3nt overcall would have worked well!|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|frankaus: the  other semi has been conceeded|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as I predicted :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: you have pretty good chances on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi All|pg||
pc|h4|nt|patricck: a good point, and maybe it isn't such an outlandish idea|pg||
nt|athene: if they unsportingly don't lead a diamond, you need partner to have a few tricks|pg||
nt|athene: or a bit of something|pg||

nt|royhughes: Braithwait-Haughie play a fairly standard 5-card major system|pg||
nt|mariner1: looks like only part scores here|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S 1N 2@H 2@S uncontested isn't impossible|pg||
nt|athene: but south might do a bit more than pass throughout|pg||
mb|1D|nt|frankaus: both these pair - live in different cities - |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that opening may put them off the failing slam|pg||
nt|patricck: here's an impossible bidding problem....how to reach 6@S from the North hand?  :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|royhughes: Chan-Lusk describe their system as Acol, but also with 5-card majors|pg||
nt|patricck: well South will WANT to do more than pass, but on that auction what else can you do?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: It would seem that NS are likely to get to 4H here|pg||
nt|athene: squirm and wriggle?|pg||
nt|jbgood: is N too strong to bid 1 NT in their methods, or ...?|pg||
nt|jbgood: also makes on the S hand with a di lead|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: he will feel happier now :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: conservative pass by S , even with a poor @H suit|pg||
pc|d6|nt|frankaus: 2@S F is my choice here|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|pg||
nt|royhughes: With the heart queen offside, it is off 4 tricks|pg||
nt|royhughes: so long as the defence doesn't have an accident|pg||
nt|royhughes: If they start with a spade, for example, they might have to shift to their clubs|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think a diamond lead might be considered normal|pg||
nt|frankaus: klinger - sydney, Hoffman - Canberra|pg||
nt|petergill: EW play Standard, 1@d 4+ cards, unusual two openings, UDCA, lead 3/5 vs suit, first discard odd/even ref http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2009/seniors/Braithwaite_Haughie.pdf|pg||
pc|s4|nt|royhughes: The other suits look unappealing to me, but Braithwait chooses a spade|pg||
nt|athene: the internet makes certain pairings possible which would be a bit impractical otherwise, for sure|pg||
nt|frankaus: Mewman - sydney - Christie - perth|pg||
pc|sA|nt|frankaus: *Newman|pg||
nt|patricck: some will overcall, some will not, depends on style, but looks fairly aggressive vul vs not|pg||
nt|athene: hard to practice when your regular partner lives about four time zones away :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|frankaus: @D lead will test Chritie|pg||
nt|jbgood: good news is that @ds are 5-3|pg||

nt|royhughes: Chan opened somewhat light -- will he do so again?|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think most players would open the South hand in today's game|pg||
nt|frankaus: runner up getting 2nd choice of the trips this year - PABF or WC |pg||
nt|jbgood: hi, early morning here, Gary:) |pg||
nt|petergill: Namyats overcalls used to be fairly common in America where  (1!m)  - 4@C = strong 4@h overcall, 4@D = strong 4@S overcall - that might work|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: It has some shape, good spots and 2 quick tricks, but it isn't enough for Chan|pg||
nt|frankaus: interested in view on this|pg||
nt|athene: you might reach 6@S here if in aggressive mood, but you will regret it this time|pg||
nt|mariner1: a Quack away from SLAM NS|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nice Sunday afternoon here Jon :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|royhughes: Lusk throws in a 4-card overcall|pg||
mb|1D|nt|royhughes: NS have a play for four spades, but not with the trump king wrong|pg||
nt|royhughes: 3@c must be a raise of some kind|pg||
nt|jbgood: a nice sunny morning here|pg||
mb|d|an|4/4 M|nt|royhughes: Chan gives a good description with a splinter raise|pg||
nt|royhughes: EW do best to let the opponents play, doubled or not|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi All from the venue|pg||
nt|royhughes: Hi David|pg||
nt|davidstern: This event is to qualify one team (2nd) to the PABF Zone 6 playoffs where Zone 7 compete as invitees and one team for the Seniors Bowl in Sao Paulo|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@C presumably a diamond raise of some sort - perhaps limit|pg||
nt|frankaus: miserable and raining in sydney|pg||
nt|petergill: Grotty 1@C opening = fairly normal in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|3D|nt|davidstern: I like the 1@S overcall by North but know it isn't everybody's cup of tea|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D (a reverse) would be forcing, so 3@D is clearly a splinter|pg||
nt|mariner1: so 3@D here meant as a splinter|pg||
nt|athene: some might play 3@D = singleton, 4@D = void|pg||
nt|athene: but clearly not this NS pair|pg||
nt|petergill: NS can make 1@H and EW make plenty of @d's|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Man Overboard|pg||
nt|jbgood: what was the redouble? Transfer?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I always greet Andy Braithwaite as Andrew it always makes him smile|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: true, but 4@s has a play of sorts|pg||
nt|royhughes: if the trump king was onside|pg||
nt|patricck: slam is only a moderate propostion....as well as the trumps behaving you need to avoid an unlucky club ruff. Today the clubs behave, but the trumps don't|pg||
nt|athene: south will go on now i think|pg||
nt|frankaus: running scores both remi's at - http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=spo&E=1&R=&T=R|pg||
nt|petergill: Had North passed, I suppose East might have passed it in. |pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: This is a lot of bidding by West and South, though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that's a world class scoring system Frank|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: if 3@D was only forcing to 3@S, then 4@S shows some extras|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 3 NT W likely to win on a heart lead|pg||
nt|patricck: undoubtedly|pg||
nt|patricck: would have been passed in if North had passed|pg||
nt|petergill: Should make 110, the club loser going on the heart, unless declarer mispicks which finesses to do|pg||
pc|s2|nt|royhughes: It looks like Braithwait imagined short spades opposite|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes 4@S would then make perhaps|pg||
nt|royhughes: and Chan imagined longer spades opposite|pg||
nt|davidstern: I hate Chan's bidding his hand twice here|pg||
nt|athene: ok - good view to pass - admittedly north had lots more encouraging bids available, like 4@C|pg||
nt|athene: but even so, you need very little for slam - just give partner @SKQxxx and it can't be that bad|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|royhughes: I don't see bidding 5@s -- Chan doesn't have extra offense beyond his splinter raise|pg||
nt|davidstern: Surely 4@D showed what he had as a passed hand|pg||
nt|royhughes: He could have doubled to show the (slight) extra strength|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|davidstern: With seeming two quick tricks and opps vul I would have taken a bite out of 5@D = 500|pg||
nt|royhughes: However, it is easier from here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|davidstern: So a swing of 800 on that decision|pg||
nt|royhughes: Haughie leads the king in case he wants to hold the lead|pg||
nt|royhughes: A good lead, I think|pg||
nt|royhughes: He may switch to a club|pg||
nt|royhughes: seeing the heart suit in the dummy|pg||
nt|frankaus: both semi winners will represent aus this year|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|jbgood: all square now after Del'Monte's team bid 7@h on  1!!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good going Richman and Gaspar|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|mariner1: so a quick 5 and out|pg||
nt|petergill: The 1C opening might tempt declarer to finesse @C10, but the heart finesse is about 75% chance I think|pg||
pc|hT|nt|patricck: sounds like partner has wasted cards in diamonds to not co-operate with your splinter, so why would his trumps be as good as @S KQxxx?|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|davidstern: I agree it is often good to lead a knowing 'non cost' high card to decide who needs to be on lead|pg||
nt|royhughes: So Braithwait's bold 5@d bid becomes a winner|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|frankaus: Del'monte team would be strongly favioured by the punters|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|patricck: the double heart finesse is definitely the best chance|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|frankaus: they were 49 imps behind an hour or so ago|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|davidstern: Bold..........................|pg||
nt|royhughes: If NS had doubled we would be criticising it more!|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|kiwibridge: at Easter NZ held "trials" as only 2 entries Open and Women and 3 Seniors it was a bit of a nothing, winners chose Brazil or Macau others take the other |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|davidstern: Um yes|pg||
pc|h9|nt|royhughes: It is one of the advantages of overbidding|pg||
nt|davidstern: Although East is probably short for his 3@C bid|pg||
nt|davidstern: So would bear part of the blame|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: slam in 3 suits will they reach one|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3@D may the final spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 6@c of course if you are desperate for points..|pg||
nt|frankaus: or not :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: andrew has the rose coloured glasses on|pg||
nt|jbgood: i thought so too - west not agreeing|pg||
mb|4C|nt|davidstern: Better idea on this hand anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: Leading low might be the best chance to set up your suit|pg||
nt|davidstern: Buchen were the second seeds and were at times struggling to qualify|pg||
nt|royhughes: but high is safer if the idea is to keep declarer from getting an extra trick|pg||
nt|frankaus: can any body X 4@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: could Haughie pass the transfer>|pg||
nt|jbgood: west doing too much when no heart fit..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was 3@C GF?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but this auction looks pretty reasonable|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes however overcalling 1N with kx @D could be a disaster and usually is|pg||
nt|patricck: 1NT overcall was the only possible way i could see that they might get there, but I must say that 1@S looks like a much better bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Which was hard as only 2 teams of 6 were eliminiated|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's exactly 50% so worth it and 100% non @S lead?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: a more fun auction would be 2c 3s p 4s x p 5c ppp|pg||
nt|patricck: Del'monte hits the lead with a non-@D lead against 6@S|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petergill: Andy Bratihwaite used to live in NZ and make nice and sensible bids, but has moved the Australia - whetheh this explains his 3@s call (instead of 3@D), NZedders could judge better ...|pg||

nt|patricck: seems like a routine 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 18 other table in 6@S: on @H lead, draw two rounds of trumps, strip out the hearts, exit @DK - East wins the ace - even on a smooth low @D exit, easy to place both @CK and @DQ ...|pg||
nt|petergill: with East and run the @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: It is tomorrow, in Australia|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mariner1: and even 3 3 @H so not a lot can go totally wrong here|pg||
mb|d|nt|royhughes: at least from here|pg||
mb|1S|an|transfer - 6-9 no major|nt|athene: yes, it's tomorrow here too, but i don't think of 1am as being morning, more evening :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: many swinggy hands - makes it interesting|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 20 - might have been better to set up the side suit (@D) first, in 4@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: another big ew hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: well on a heart lead you need a fair amount of luck, but it all works for you|pg||
nt|athene: spade finesse, and not 5 hearts with the @DA|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S transfer to 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: 3NT would be a wonderful contract here|pg||
nt|athene: well west can bid 2@S if that's constructive, but east will just bid 4@S over that i guess|pg||
nt|royhughes: But 4@s is almost cold, too|pg||
nt|athene: i agree 3nt has the merit of being exactly 100% sure to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: yes, too many values not to bid it, and even though a @H lead is frightening you can't really go wrong|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops I meant 4 4 @H of course|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H now, surely|pg||
nt|patricck: absolutely|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: 3@s is probably invitational|pg||
nt|royhughes: Often pairs use the 4th suit on game-going hands|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: yes, although that can get unwieldy|pg||
nt|petergill: We're not Seniors yet. |pg||
pc|s9|nt|kiwibridge: don't like 4C|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 @c should have been forcing, right?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mariner1: well 5@C is not 3N|pg||
nt|athene: north shows the club fit courteously|pg||
pc|h3|nt|royhughes: ys, of course.  A quick look at their card shows me they play 4th suit game-forcing|pg||
nt|athene: if you have to go through 4th suit just to make a forcing jump rebid in your suit (or a forcing raise in partner's second suit) it can get awkward|pg||
nt|athene: i guess it might not be called a "courtesy raise" if it means you get to play it :)|pg||
nt|athene: south decided the hearts were just too likely to be a problem in 3nt, but with basically two balanced hands, this is quite a view to take|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks like a playable spot|pg||
nt|patricck: looks like 3 losers|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he could probe with something clever like 3@D or 3@H over 3@C, expressing doubt about 3nt|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes needs a defensive slip, and that will not be easy to find|pg||
nt|athene: i would have just bid 3nt over 1nt long ago and wandered off in search of food, i must admit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or 3@H|pg||
pc|hK|nt|royhughes: I don't see much the defenders can do.  If they lead trumps to stop the club ruff, declarer can work on hearts|pg||
nt|jbgood: he should show some club support ..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3N looks the best spot|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: actually there's no reason for declarer to get hearts right|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: older and wiser?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: south might have doubled 4@C, saving the 12th trick, but no big deal|pg||
nt|frankaus: may be able to limit def to 1@H & 1 @D|pg||
nt|mariner1:  I am with Bill... btw what's for dinner :)|pg||
nt|patricck: i'm mystified, you have a singleton @C and pard is prob short in @D, why not compete?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kiwibridge: xxx not great support|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: the spade finesse doesn't help - a pitch from the three-card heart holding|pg||
nt|petergill: older and passier? = pass-ier|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|athene: although you might actually need the spade finesse to come to 11 tricks - as well as @DAx somewhere of course|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugrapha2: he pulled out the 7D and almost played it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Richman has gone for 1100 on 4 for a ghastly result|pg||
nt|jbgood: would still make 10|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|patricck: older and passe....eh?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|royhughes: Declarer is thinking of ducking|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer just has to set up the hearts whilst dummy has a trump to stop the club cash - or he will think he does|pg||
pc|c2|pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|patricck: you don't want to take the @S finesse either, you're already hoping that fails so that 3NT in the other room has no chance|pg||
nt|athene: yes, true|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mariner1: only real chance now is Ax @D|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mariner1: and he tries it|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|kiwibridge: while this remains close Kanetkar has Stuart on the ropes in the other semi final|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|royhughes: I thought playing hearts was safer than this|pg||

nt|athene: and hope the diamonds pull their weight|pg||
nt|athene: south has a straightfoward double of 2@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: what's a "punter" as used there Patrick?|pg||
nt|athene: but it might get more complicated if the 2@H bid is actually a multi-2@D|pg||
nt|frankaus: i was counciled not to back anything were the participants breathe|pg||
nt|patricck: another word for gambler....taking a punt also used as taking a gamble|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I think they do Erin :)|pg||

nt|mariner1: thanks :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: the big swings keep rolling|pg||
mb|1S|nt|royhughes: Yes -- South's diamonds will be a bit of a disappointment|pg||

mb|d|an|transfer 6-9 no major|nt|athene: ah ok|pg||

mb|2S|nt|patricck: Buchen goes into the lead on Board 20, but we think they will lose it again on board 21, exciting stuff|pg||
mb|3D|nt|royhughes: NS's 1NT range must be sort of low|pg||
nt|athene: well they aren't vulnerable, so north takes the low road|pg||
mb|3H|an|long suit try or 4+ hearts|nt|royhughes: I like fairly robust 1NT overcalls|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: N: "sorry, I can't count"|pg||
nt|royhughes: Things lie quite well for declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: Bill Haughie, a regular in Aussie Senior teams, is originally from New Zealand (OK, so not all of Aus's top players come from NZ), has lived in Queensland (i.e sunny north ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Australia) for decades. Bill started his computer company perhaps 40 years ago, employing John Gosney who moved from England to work for him and whose son Paul coincidentally is ...|pg||
nt|petergill: well known in Aussie bridge circles. |pg||
mb|4D|nt|athene: well this contract will present few problems|pg||
nt|royhughes: for taking lots of tricks, I mean|pg||
nt|frankaus: multi - = less |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's hard to explain Richmans final bid of 4@S on 4 a real pairs bid|pg||
nt|petergill: A conservative 4@D. 5@D fails with @HQ offside|pg||
mb|4S|nt|petergill: 4@s fails if the club ruff is found|pg||
nt|patricck: harder to find the club ruff with the @CAxx on lead|pg||
mb|5D|nt|petergill: Dbl was a transfer to 1NT, I think|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|jbgood: not even at pairs..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no thats what I thought, a brain explosion :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 2nd chance when @SA wins?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@S should make here|pg||
nt|athene: one ruffing finesse coming right up|pg||
nt|patricck: Del'Monte have edged 4 imps closer with two swings of 2 imps each, the margin is now only 10 imps|pg||
nt|patricck: 9.5 imps actually i believe|pg||
nt|athene: north could pretty much plan that during the auction, if east had a sensible sort of suit quality|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: yes, true|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kiwibridge: Bill played here with Alan Turner, also with Diego Vettori, grandfather of NZ's current cricket captain when I first knew him|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: playing for !Q9x or @DJ9x onside|pg||
nt|athene: @DQ9x / @DJ9x|pg||
nt|athene: but with that holding west might insert the honour|pg||
nt|athene: a non-heart lead and there would be more work to do|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|kiwibridge: it was Andrew Braithwaite who told me last year "there is no such contract as 2NT"|pg||
nt|jbgood: almost home now |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|royhughes: It looks a bit strange, though, because declarer isn't likely to want to take a second diamond finesse|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|petergill: and with Bob Scott I think too|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mariner1: turns out best lead would have been a @S|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|royhughes: plus, as you say, West might insert an honour|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: a singleton trump isn't very appealing though|pg||

nt|athene: west might still think a while before switching to @CKQxx - he might be worried about the actual club layout|pg||
nt|athene: and be working out if the diamonds are going to be set up for a club pitch|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but he might well switch to a small club from that holding, if he judges the defence need two tricks|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mariner1: NS need to stay low here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|royhughes: right you are|pg||
nt|athene: now west can reopen with some number of something|pg||
nt|royhughes: This time I think there are 9 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: interesting view from north|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N is pretty low|pg||
nt|athene: it looks normal to do something with 5-4 majors, doesn't it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2@C is aggressive|pg||
nt|royhughes: when the club ace shows up in the East, where you don't expect it|pg||
nt|mariner1: N has a perfect garbage stayman hand|pg||
nt|frankaus: once more an exciting hand|pg||
mb|2H|nt|royhughes: aggressive unless it is for play, which is how we used to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north will certainly go to game if south bids 2nt over 2@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: heres the heavy 2C in action again|pg||
nt|petergill: Henry Christie is originally from England I think - now from Perth. He used to play a Forcing Pass System for many years.  |pg||
nt|patricck: 6@H can make here, but very unlikely to bid it, and you wouldn't make it on most days, just today on this favourable layout|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: then east will double|pg||
nt|athene: or might double|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if 1nt - 2@C; 2@D - 2@H is constructive, you can't risk stayman, i don't think|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|royhughes: I don't see how they can beat it, do you?|pg||
nt|athene: interesting view from west not to rebid |pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: but in that case you just transfer|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, can't imagine why you wouldn't, go 2@C then 2@H unless they use that sequence for relay|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: comp. no is 2748|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: he sure has some playing strength|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: needs a trick from the defence here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there it is!|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: What would you have bid, diamonds or spades?|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess he decided he isn't winning the auction and he doesn't especially want a diamond, as opposed to spade, lead|pg||
nt|athene: i would be tempted to rebid 2@D|pg||
nt|petergill: The fate of 6@H shows the power of having good trump quality in one's slams|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jbgood: N will have to make a few discards on the @ds|pg||
nt|petergill: EW system is at http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2009/seniors/Braithwaite_Haughie.pdf|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mariner1: true if not garbage you have to trans to @H or pass|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: probably still just the 8|pg||
nt|frankaus: i back declarer for 9+|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but wait! may still have a @S stop|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: W/S closed the curtain and are discussing N's lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: spades blocked - easy nine|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: curtain open and W is thinking|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: curtain closed again|pg||
nt|jbgood: "curtains"|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: couldnt see what they were discussing|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: and ... open again, more thinking by w|pg||
pc|s7|nt|patricck: if those were my two options i'd still rather transfer to 2@H with a 5-4 hand, even with the terrible heart suit|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: yes, having a bad suit doesn't mean you don't want it to be trumps|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|athene: in fact the worse your suit is, very often, the MORE you want it to be trumps|pg||
pc|h6|nt|royhughes: Difficult decision for West here, although it won't matter|pg||
nt|royhughes: Shifting to diamonds would be good if partner has Q10|pg||
nt|athene: well as soon as he starts thinking, north is happy|pg||
nt|athene: he knows east has the @CA :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, that's right|pg||
nt|royhughes: If partner has Axx in diamonds, though, you want to keep playing spades|pg||
nt|athene: yes you need partner to have something useful like @DAxx @CQxx|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: but a diamond caters for @DA @CQ and @DAQ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|patricck: bad suit bad hand you want them to be trumps, but bad suit good hand is probably the reverse|pg||
nt|petergill: @S7 was upside down count, showing four spades|pg||

mb|p|nt|royhughes: Lusk will have other ideas|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @D the Braithwaite-Haughie conerstone bid|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: i don't think it's clear to go 2nt at all|pg||
nt|frankaus: drop @Sq after ruffing 2@C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Erin has just pointed out Andrew could exit a @S to N for a possible forced overtrick :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: at pairs perhaps|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: the lead and south's play at trick one said he had the AK left only|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3@C = game try i expect|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: you are OK here as long as west doesn't have a spade AND diamond entry|pg||
nt|royhughes: the 6-1 split ruins EW here|pg||
nt|athene: and that would give him a lot - @HQJ @SA @DKJ|pg||
nt|petergill: Their transfers are only by responder after competition|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oops the FG pass?|pg||
nt|jbgood: more like stone|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mariner1: 4@H is easier because the K@D is protected|pg||
nt|jbgood: but why bother - you sh play 4 spades - no more - no less|pg||
nt|patricck: Andy has finally got to the wheel. He has been twiddling his thumbs as dummy for 5 consecutive hands and now he gets to be declarer in 2@D with 25 points between the two hands|pg||
nt|petergill: some sort of mix-up obviously|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: i suppose it depends on what you expect for a weak-2@H|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: these guys are old dont forget|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jbgood: even then you might be happy with 3 NT making and settle for 9|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@S is quite a good contract, would want to be in it, and it will probably make on this layout|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: agreed|pg||
nt|jbgood: they will surely bid game at the other table|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he won't be that happy Patrick, alert did say 2@D forcing to game|pg||
nt|petergill: A Senior moment|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: by whom :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|royhughes: Well, declarer doesn't have a sure hand entry to play diamonds|pg||
nt|frankaus: new leader|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|jbgood: one of the seniors:)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|patricck: thats a little strong, we all know strange things happen, but they are likely to bid it, yes|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mariner1: forget what? :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: is stiff @CK enough to accept the game try?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||
nt|petergill: Del'monte might well lose their slim lead on this hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|davidstern: Carfuk VG Op they may see this later|pg||
nt|davidstern: Careful|pg||
nt|athene: @D4 normal attitude, saying "i don't have @DK, we had better cash another club"|pg||
nt|athene: if west had @DAK and wanted to know if a second was standing up, he would lead the @DK|pg||
nt|athene: the only difficult for west comes when he has @DAxx and isn't sure whether to underlead to give a guess, which would be silly if there were a third club to cash :)|pg||
nt|patricck: 12 imps from 3NT in the other room, where Newman-Christie played an unsuccessful 5@C in this room means we have a new leader|pg||
nt|frankaus: NV or it would be even more certain|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|royhughes: but with the KJ tight he will be fine|pg||
nt|royhughes: so long as he plays for the drop|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: no, i am sure he will score up 430 very shortly|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c5|nt|royhughes: What if he ducks a diamond, and then tries to throw East in with clubs for a diamond return?|pg||
nt|royhughes: Braithwait maybe needed to throw a heart|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|royhughes: so that he won't show out on the second club|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: N: "sorry to raise your lebensohl, you must have taken a bit of  fright"|pg||
nt|athene: Klinger perhaps took a long time after the @DA because he was considering if his partner held @DK4 doubleton?|pg||

nt|petergill: so there's plenty of time|pg||

nt|petergill: Ish is not the youngest ever to npc a Seniors Team - Dan Korbel in his mid 20's npc'd Canada Seniors who topped the qualifiers in the WC in Shanghai in 2007|pg||
nt|petergill: Quite some hand for 2@h at this vulnerability|pg||

nt|patricck: my spies tell me that 1NT* is about to make in the other room....by NS!!!!  2@D down 1 will be a pickup|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 24: other table is in 1NTX by Sotuh which might well make for 180 and a 4 imp gain|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: they wouldn't want to lead a spade against 5@C though|pg||
nt|frankaus: some would open N a muid 2@S|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: aggressive double on a ten count facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C = potential for another mixup?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: has anyone ever passed on your 1st go with an 8 card suit?|pg||
nt|patricck: apparently in the other room South thought that North had opened 1@D so was responding 1NT....but it was actually an overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i guess it's OK with perfect shape and two aces|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I hate Bill's weak 2@C game force|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: 4@S+2 here, should be both speedy and flat|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes however he is NV vs VUL so jacking the auction up|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: may lead to a good ? 4@S save|pg||
nt|jbgood: me too, not to mention 5 spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: to me he has a 4@S opener and thats it|pg||
nt|patricck: i don't like it much either, but then again there isn't an action with that hand that I DO like particularly|pg||
nt|jbgood: N might save in 7@d - he will not expect S to have 2 aces for his nonvulnerable jump|pg||
nt|frankaus: more then a few riding on opening lead if the get to 6@S|pg||
nt|frankaus: @CA looks standout tho|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@S can make|pg||
nt|athene: the 3@C opener might find the @DQ for them - but maybe not, when east shows out on the first trump|pg||
pc|c3|nt|royhughes: Great fitting hands and some luck here -- you could make a slam|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: H shows a STRONG takeout of 3@C :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H showed clubs and a red suit, a 5/5 two suiter I think|pg||
nt|jbgood: this should go down|pg||
pc|c9|nt|royhughes: Yes, you would think so|pg||
nt|mariner1: he has to play K@H in E and can play W for all the rest he needs|pg||
nt|frankaus: back christie to make this|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@S can make, and so might 5@C E?W if they were to get a spade lead, this could be  a very big board|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am "punting" for a make :)|pg||
nt|athene: west's 3NT bid at unfavourable certainly suggests he has the @DQ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||

pc|dA|nt|royhughes: There is some danger in crossing to dummy to finesse trumps, but not much|pg||

pc|d2|nt|kiwibridge: T Reese : lead an Ace|pg||

nt|royhughes: Declarer maybe made 6|pg||
nt|patricck: you are already finessing east for the K@H, seems like overkill to play them for the Q@D as well, so I am sure declarer will get the diamonds right|pg||

nt|frankaus: 3NT here 4 me  at these colours |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now everyone will have lots to say|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: have been impressed by Buchen team performance as sort of expected similar result to the other semi|pg||
mb|4H|nt|royhughes: I'm sympathetic -- I like aces and kings|pg||
nt|athene: and north, with the best hand at the table, will be mildly bemused|pg||
nt|patricck: everybody's 3NT isn't it?|pg||
nt|petergill: Raising to 4@H is automatic in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: NS have a shot at 4@S -- may be tricky to find the suit|pg||
nt|royhughes: Double must have shown hearts, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: Maybe they play transfers over overcalls|pg||
nt|athene: if you think that 1@D overcalls should be either a good hand or good suit, north could just bid 3nt|pg||
nt|royhughes: Will South pass, or continue with showing spades?|pg||
nt|athene: the traditional meaning of 1@C (1@D) X is 44 majors, but many are rejecting that |pg||
nt|athene: in order to get the transfers in|pg||
nt|athene: rehi everyone...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: X = hearts; 1@H = spades|pg||
pc|dK|nt|royhughes: I think spades plays better than notrump|pg||
nt|patricck: N/S would make 4@S if they located the J@S, but neither of them could sensibly enter the auction here|pg||
nt|petergill: Buchen team won the National Seniors Teams in January from all these other guys. |pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: perhaps north was worried that 1@S would be a) non-forcing or b) promise 5|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes coffee hand|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: west was certainly hitting 3nt - he knows the diamonds aren't going anywhere fast|pg||
nt|athene: it's pretty rare you want to play in 2nt, if you have a 6-card suit|pg||
nt|athene: if the suit runs, you normally make 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: if it doesn't, you probably go down in 2|pg||
nt|athene: but south probably just wanted to pass before the doubling started :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think so|pg||
nt|frankaus: is there any point to 2@C?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes promote a minor suit lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
nt|patricck: presumably Buchen was aiming at 5 of a minor if there was a spade weakness|pg||

nt|athene: so board 25 turns into a double doubled game-swing|pg||
nt|mariner1: 25 was 16 imps,,,,,,,, a doubled double game swing,,,,,,,,,, say that 5 times|pg||
nt|mariner1: quickly|pg||
nt|patricck: double and 1NT?|pg||
nt|petergill: South must have been playing for West not to be 55 (else 3505) perhaps 2506? |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: at best a partial here|pg||
nt|petergill: due to the non-5@C call by East?|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 NT has its chanses|pg||
mb|2N|nt|royhughes: Right -- and it's the wrong vulnerability for trapping|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, but with 12 opposite 12 can be hard to stay in a partial|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: often when your only long suit has been bid naturally by opps it reduces your playing strength, but north has all the diamond spots|pg||
nt|athene: indeed the spade lead against 5@C was fatal, allowing two fast diamond pitches|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: as was suggested as a possibility at our table|pg||
nt|mariner1: ok Bill, is it a doubled double game swing, or a double doubled game swing? :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Peter Buchen will be surprised to have dropped imps on Bd 26|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|patricck: option 2 i think :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: "bad board" is another way to describe it|pg||
pc|h7|nt|royhughes: Conservative by Chan, wouldn't you say?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|athene: considering he invited with a 6-count on board 7, maybe|pg||

nt|royhughes: Chan's card says 15-18 for 1N overcall|pg||
nt|patricck: some good words there Rob, but do you have anything to describe 33 Imps in 2 boards?|pg||
nt|athene: i see the auction to 6@D has been censored|pg||
nt|petergill: Four boards to go - with Del'monte looking the favourites at this stage|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so close looking at 31-32 open room scores|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mariner1: Arithmophobia|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: Lusk opens the major|pg||
nt|jbgood: the dealing machine has been very generous to us kibs today:)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|royhughes: I like to open the long suit -- what about you, Bill?|pg||
nt|royhughes: 3@c must be an artificial raise|pg||
nt|athene: i tend to prefer the 6-card suit yes|pg||
nt|royhughes: But both methods must be playable, I think|pg||
nt|athene: but 1@S will work out just fine here|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, decent of partner to have 4-card support|pg||
nt|athene: that's the problem with the internet - there might be young children watching at any point :)|pg||
nt|athene: so perhaps these things are best left hidden|pg||
nt|patricck: no, arithmophobia is no good, I don't think fear of numbers really covers it :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Today's winners play Terry Brown - Avi Kanetkar, Paul Lavings - Robert Krochmalik and Bruce Neill - Mike Hughes (a strong team) tomorrow for the right to go to Brazil to rep ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Australia.|pg||
nt|patricck: Buchen could have made 5@C EW on board 27, if he had the scores would have been only half an imp apart|pg||
mb|2N|an|5 s 6 h|nt|royhughes: 4@s will require some handling to bring in the diamonds, if NS get to play it|pg||
nt|petergill: The losers tomorrow go to Macau to rep Aus in the PABF in June|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|mariner1: we are often abreticular its true Bill :)|pg||
nt|athene: how about "irrational fear of showing your majors in response to Stayman"?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well you need to fear the Opponents getting BIG numbers from you :)|pg||
nt|athene: of course i am sure i am maligning east and he doesn't really suffer from that at all|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: bd 26: 1h 2c 2d 2h 3c 3d 3h 3s 4c 5c 5d 6d ppp|pg||
nt|petergill: So the winners of this match win Aussie representative caps, so there could be some nerves|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you lead a small diamond towards the @DQ and are happy-ish if west gets a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: as happy as you ever are when your winner gets ruffed :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: yes, indeed -- better for the defence to play clubs or hearts, maybe|pg||
nt|royhughes: hearts|pg||
mb|3C|an|"nonsystemic but a good hand"|nt|kiwibridge: in our "trials" the winners could chose to go to Macau :)|pg||
nt|petergill: That choice applies here too, I believe, Gary|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we still don't know what they have decided|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: I doubt you can beat it if declarer plays carefully|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@C will be puppet or "Kerrie" or whatever it's called|pg||
nt|patricck: ppp at the end of that was short for puke puke puke?|pg||
nt|patricck: slam may look like it is just on the heart finesse, but actually it is on the @H behaving + there being no outside ruff, so this is a slam you would rather not be in|pg||
nt|jbgood: 1@d transfer? 2@d art gf?|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H - 5@C P P 5@H I predict|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it was over a week ago but we are still in the dark|pg||
mb|4H|nt|royhughes: but let's see what happens|pg||
mb|5C|nt|frankaus: i have been told klinger no longer plats Kerrie|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I think South will pass 5@C then dbl 5@H |pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 5 @c is a downer on repeated spade leads - but how is W to know? He may be afraid that E only has 3 hearts and 2 spades though|pg||
mb|d|nt|royhughes: EW play low encourages|pg||
nt|petergill: I have rarely before been able to predict players' bids on BBO - could this be a first?|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: but some other form of enq |pg||
nt|petergill: No|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Spade lead is normal. |pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: So West asked for a heart continuation|pg||
mb|p|pc|s8|nt|athene: declarer has to lose to the @HA as well, even when the clubs come in for four tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: No reason not to play three rounds of @S to promote @S10|pg||
nt|petergill: @C10 I mean|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jbgood: up north we play 2@h direct on the E hand after transfer as 4 cards heart and 12-14. So 1@h is either 3, or some strong hand if 4 |pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|frankaus: 2@C = puppet to 2@D the reasp discribes hand|pg||
nt|athene: north just didn't have a spot card higher than the @S6|pg||
nt|athene: well, he did have, but he wasted it at trick 1 |pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: if he had led a big spot here, declarer would have had a decision|pg||
nt|athene: whether to rise with the @SA or hold it up|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: certainly the classic defence to a 2-suiter is to force|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jbgood: only if he wants to beat the contract|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer might pick @d's  I think, but he might play West to be AKQ10x, KQJ10x, Qx, x. |pg||
nt|jbgood: he has shown 5-6 in the majors|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 28 flat, only 4 boards ro be scored|pg||
nt|petergill: to be|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: try to shorten the trumps in the shapely hand and kill the long suit|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s9|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|frankaus: transfer advances is a feature of the game that will be popularised over the next 10 years IMO|pg||

nt|royhughes: and I think declarer is in trouble -- Braithwait will not trump this|pg||

nt|royhughes: I'll have to check it out afterwards -- tomorrow, that is|pg||
nt|patricck: looks like its all over|pg||
nt|petergill: so lead is 24, with effectively one board to gain masses of imps for the Buchen team |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: certainly ruffing with a trump winner was wrong - it can even be wrong to ruff with a trump LOSER - there's a famous hand where Hamman did just that|pg||
nt|athene: refusing to over-ruff from just xxx trumps|pg||
nt|royhughes: I remember that one|pg||
nt|athene: west is likely to insist on game now, facing an opening bid|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I suspect that is it but a great match thx to the abf for bringing it to us|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: and caused declarer to lose control eventually and go more down|pg||
nt|petergill: This hardly looks like the dynamite board Buchen needs|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: but i don't think it's going to make|pg||
mb|d|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW have only 2 scores on their side in 12 boards......  won imps on 5 though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: should be a great final tomorrow Kanetkar having had a nice rest|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S all pass one would think|pg||
nt|jbgood: :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Braithwaite and Haughie keen to represent their adopted country|pg||
mb|2S|nt|royhughes: Good memory, Bill -- that hand was quite a while ago|pg||
nt|athene: now a quiet 2@H from north|pg||
nt|athene: not exactly what south wanted to hear :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: yes, they're ahead 5 swings to 3 :)|pg||
nt|athene: ok, West settles for simply inviting|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: There's something to be said for 2@d by North|pg||
nt|royhughes: It may be wrong, but will work out well sometimes|pg||
nt|athene: well, if you have game, it's likely to be because you have six hearts|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, I don't quarrel with 2@h|pg||
nt|athene: so i have sympathy for 2@H, even if 2@D will sometimes be a safer spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: spot on Peter |pg||
pc|d7|nt|royhughes: With one partner, I played that 2@c denied holding 3 hearts -- then South can continue with 2@h on a doubleton if he has a good hand|pg||
nt|royhughes: Playing that way, 2@d is more attractive|pg||
nt|royhughes: But it is an eccentric way to play|pg||
nt|athene: hehehe well after all that, north did bid 2@D :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: sorry the room is very dark and they are using written bidding|pg||
nt|royhughes: The joke's on us|pg||
nt|athene: no problem|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mariner1: so BAM we would be looking at opposite results|pg||
nt|petergill: Kanetkar's opponents in their semi had done very well just to make the semis, being a last minute team scavenged together when the field was one team short.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: i am glad no-one ever has to rely on MY handwriting to see what i have bid|pg||
nt|royhughes: One argument for 2@d is that partner is quite likely to be short in hearts, and you could lose quite a few trump tricks|pg||
nt|athene: it's hard for partner to raise the "indecipherable squiggle" suit|pg||
nt|royhughes: :)|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps East thought it was forcing? 3NT very pushy facing a NF 3@S bid|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, they would be happy at board-a-match|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|mariner1: this can make now|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|patricck: can and should|pg||
nt|athene: a club lead would have been a lot better|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: has to win q here|pg||
nt|patricck: it may have been the unbid suit, but i hate leading Jxx|pg||
nt|athene: it was close between a club and a heart, i think, on this auction|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs the 4th @H|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer has four diamonds, @CAK, three hearts|pg||
nt|athene: the defence only have @SAK, @DK, @HK|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he can win A@H and lead one back to Q@H|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: 3@C shows extra values of course...all very reasonable|pg||
nt|royhughes: Chan decides to try 3N, rather than an 11-trick game|pg||
pc|s8|nt|royhughes: Yes, it looks well-judged to me|pg||
nt|royhughes: NS are unlucky that 3rd hand has both spade honours|pg||
nt|royhughes: On any other lie the spade lead would blow a trick|pg||
nt|athene: they are also unlucky that east can win the @CA and put another spade through|pg||
nt|royhughes: Declarer has 8 tricks after playing a club|pg||
nt|petergill: So Kanetkar will have a major lift in class of opposition tomorrow|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: now the defence have 2 spades, @CA, @HA set up|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, you're right|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|frankaus: the lead starting to look formitable even with 36 hands to score|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|patricck: feels like there should be a way for the defence to beat this, but the spades are such that everything doesn't quite seem to work|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|patricck: ouch, another 15 to Buchen.....48 imps in 4 boards....and one of them was a push!!!!|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h9|nt|royhughes: But 5 rounds of diamonds might put West under pressure|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps declarer has to get cute to make this|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: west has stuff in all three non-diamond suits|pg||
nt|frankaus: tho at 15+ at a time it can change quickly|pg||
nt|mariner1: Buchen has a loss coming up though|pg||
nt|athene: i have to say, when people lead short suits against 3nt, trying to find partner, it has a very low success rate|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: leading a long suit which dummy has shown, really doesn't work|pg||
nt|athene: but leading a long suit which declarer has shown 4 in is very often fine|pg||
pc|hT|nt|patricck: leading xx trying to find parter has a better chance than Jxx|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: and is going to get crushed for sure|pg||
nt|royhughes: I guess his best shot may be to play a heart|pg||
nt|athene: well he would have done if declarer rose the @SA there|pg||
nt|athene: to preserve a menace in spades|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: Still, Kanetkar, with two pairs from our Beijing Seniors team, and another top class pair, will be hard to beat. |pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: 6@S may have been insurance vs 6@H though|pg||

nt|snorris: must be 1nt|pg||

nt|athene: 5 @C 4@H isn't an ideal shape to open but with 3 spades you can raise the inconvenient 1@S response so you don't have that much of a rebid problem|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: Christie makes a try|pg||
mb|3S|nt|royhughes: No, that makes sense to me, but so long as partner knows what you do, either way is ok|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north assumes his partner has diamonds - the huge double fit isn't disclosed|pg||
nt|mariner1: this swing maybe an 1 imp the 15 level|pg||
nt|patricck: only 14 coming back in....  a mere bagatelle|pg||
nt|petergill: A normal auction, until North selected 3@S instead of the intuitive 3NT|pg||

pc|d5|nt|jbgood: cannot afford to duck this |pg||
nt|jbgood: a di return would be fatal|pg||
nt|petergill: I would rather be in 3NT trying for 600 than 3S in a 5-2 fit with 73 doubleton trying for 140|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: 4@H needs a lot with partner - major-suit finesses are likely to fail, with south having a decent hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|royhughes: Yes, maybe it was a close decision|pg||

nt|mariner1: a quartonce and not a quintonce|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes very good advice|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|petergill: The Klinger treatment of playing Intermediate Jump Shifts at the other table is a good one - worth noting for those Bergen-Raise-Haters of you who are unsure what to play 1@S - 3@D ...|pg||

mc|9|nt|petergill: Henry Christie is a good card player, but he has to make about 40 overtricks for 140 plus 1200 = 1340 to stay in the match |pg||
nt|petergill: Just the 140|pg||

nt|mariner1: chance for a huge swing here too|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@S biddable and 7 makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: yes, you would be unhappy to reach only 6@S|pg||
nt|frankaus: we have had 14,15,16,17  whats next 13 or 18|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mariner1: I would be extremely unhappy to reach only 5|pg||
nt|mariner1: octonce|pg||
nt|patricck: i think they have to double 71S to get 18 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: A comfortable win for Del'monte (Ish = npc, for those who think Ish has aged 25 years overnight) as it turns out |pg||
mb|1N|nt|mariner1: W has an awfully strong hand for 1N imho|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S from west?|pg||
nt|athene: then east will bid slam surely|pg||
nt|frankaus: chance here 4 pickup|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can this one be bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 5@S = OUT slam try works|pg||
nt|patricck: a very good slam, but looks like a tough one to bid|pg||
nt|frankaus: this will help|pg||
mb|3N|nt|royhughes: and my co-commentator, William Frisby of England|pg||
nt|mariner1: any slam try works here :)|pg||
nt|athene: diamond raise from North might work to his side's disadvantage|pg||
nt|mariner1: or should|pg||
nt|petergill: Getting easier to bid now after the 2@D transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: there is a slam try|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, the key feature was that in the other room N/S were bidding hearts, much more worrying for East|pg||
nt|patricck: Braithwaite won't be encouraged to hear about the diamonds sitting over him though|pg||
nt|frankaus: this wont|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: I am Roy Hughes from Canada -- thank you all for watching|pg||
nt|athene: the next segment is coming up in an hour i think?|pg||
nt|royhughes: That sounds right -- I just remember it was too late for me|pg||
nt|athene: 6@S sounds very like a diamond void - west must be tempted|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Klinger leaning back in his chair to tank awhile|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: south falls asleep|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nice when pard transfers to your AKQx|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it's being suggested that 6@D would sound more like a diamond void|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|royhughes: This is a borderline slam that goes down with the king of clubs wrong|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL coming??? :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: nope|pg||
nt|athene: but east is a bit short of side aces|pg||
nt|athene: plus he doesn't want to tip off the heart lead|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|royhughes: It would be a bad slam to bid, surely, and EW stop in a good spot|pg||
nt|athene: you can't go round bidding slams with NO first-round controls|pg||
nt|petergill: Haughie reasoned that if @CK was missing, on the bidding it would be offside - hence his conservative bidding|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: east put just the 8 down and waited for a disappointed gasp from west before putting down akq and laughing|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|athene: i think 7@S was certainly not impossible to find - although it wasn't easy of course by any means, either|pg||
nt|mariner1: thanks all !|pg||
nt|athene: well done to Klinger|pg||
nt|frankaus: only 17 :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: so a close match again|pg||
nt|athene: it was doubly hard in that there was no way 7@S could induce a phantom save|pg||
nt|athene: which is where a lot of your equity comes from in these situations, very often|pg||
nt|athene: if you are V vs NV and opps have a higher-ranking suit, you might sometimes bid an iffy grand, as opps will take the insurance|pg||
nt|jbgood: even with a worthless @d king slam is on|pg||
nt|petergill: some care is required to make 3NT on a spade lead, such as ensuring that when @HJx drops, the ten can be cashed and  there's an entry to @HQ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: yes, even with the @CK right it would need some work|pg||
nt|royhughes: that's right|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: is he 40 yet?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|frankaus: last tu all 4 ur company  - more excitement - final set  sch in 20 minutes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Haughie Humour|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes,  2@d Dbl 6@h directly was a possible call, planning to pitch spades on clubs. |pg||
nt|jbgood: see you then - bye|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: beeen great thx specs for your feedback see you all back here soon|pg||
