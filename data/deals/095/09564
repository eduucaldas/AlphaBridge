nt|super nova: what is the saying for 7-5?|pg||
nt|athene: looks as though E-W made a HCP double of 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|athene: i actually think there is a case for opening 3@C with north|pg||
nt|super nova: I should look up thier system to see what their 2's are?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: the thing is, with 7-5, you are going to rebid again unilaterally anyway|pg||
nt|mariner1: hard to beat 4@S DBL here|pg||
nt|athene: you open 3@C, wait for people to bid red suits, then bid 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: now you showed your hand pretty exactly|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: whereas you might well not open 3@C with only four spades|pg||
mb|2S|nt|super nova: 2s = 5-10 5 spades and 5 of a minor.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: and no Dbl which means trouble this time......|pg||
nt|super nova: I thought this would get X on this Auction.|pg||
nt|mariner1: for NS who will lose imps|pg||
nt|athene: good judgement from Ozenir with AA|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6 or 7 in the glue here|pg||
nt|athene: the key is:- no-one forced west to bid 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: north sorry|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: it wasn't even an advance sac since nothing suggested E-W were about to bid game|pg||
nt|athene: so he clearly has a funny hand|pg||
nt|athene: if you push opps into a contract, you double it freely, but if they choose to bid it...you need to be looking at a surprise (i.e. a trump stack usually)|pg||
nt|super nova: Do we know who is playing in the other room this time?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Hollands and Gold are sitting out this match for the Butler team|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|d7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|super nova: Flick and Di against Hinge |pg||
nt|super nova: and Morgan.|pg||
nt|athene: east could have risen @CK perhaps - if declarer has @CAx you are dead anyway|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: im not sure who is playing in the other room for the Pennant team|pg||

mb|1C|an|16+|mb|p|mb|1D|an|0-7|mb|p|mb|3C|an|Forcing 20+|nt|mariner1: 1@D negative, usually 7 or less|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3@C must show 5 4 or ???|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mariner1: or its point count|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C looks like natural and forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mariner1: so natural and 20+|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3@C sure eats up a lot of room...... however danger is N passing|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mariner1: I like a 1@H relay to 1@S to 2@C showing this hand|pg||
nt|athene: N-S really didn't get to grips with the hand|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|h3|nt|mariner1: so when you go through 1@H the next call is promoted as if you skipped a level|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|athene: after 1@C - 1@D, either you play 1@H as 20+, or you play 1@H/1@S F1, and can use a 2major bid to show a very strong minor 2-suiter|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. 1@C - 1@D; 2@S = GF with 54 minors|pg||

pc|d5|pc|hT|pc|dK|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h9|pc|sK|mc|11|nt|mariner1: 1@C - 1@D - 1@H - 1n is 19-21+  2@C = 5+ @c and 20+  2@D = 5+ and 20 + and so on|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|mariner1: btw a trick I have learned the hard way,,,, a bad 19 is 18|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|super nova: Was that when overcalling. So X and bid NT instead of overcalling 1nt with 19?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: E-W have three trump tricks here and the red aces|pg||
nt|mariner1: well I meant going through the @H relay after 1@C - 1@D|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|athene: it's just a question of whether declarer can deal with his clubs and keep control of the hand|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||

pc|c6|nt|mariner1: double part score swing|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s4|pc|c4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|athene: declarer doesn't really care if east ruffs the odd red trick along the way|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: it will be with a trump trick anyway|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|athene: hmmm did he really do that? :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugrapha2: yep he sure did |pg||

pc|h9|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|super nova: Perhaps the Nerves are getting to Chira and Hohor?|pg||
nt|athene: well throwing a winner on a winner was a brilliant play - but on some other layout, not this one, sadly|pg||
mc|6|nt|mariner1: well I jinxed it,,,, commentator's curse :(|pg||
pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mariner1: 3N played well EW in Closed Room|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some spot cards are helping - @D9, @C109, @S10 all might play a part|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mariner1: E should invite at least|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|mariner1: w will have to duck at least one @H|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: yes, duck the first heart and then plod away at clubs|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: and eventually make 2 clubs, 1 spade, 4 diamonds, 2 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: you do have to take the third-round diamond finesse (restricted choice there)|pg||
nt|athene: but south might be getting squeezed in spades and diamonds by that point|pg||
nt|super nova: defence can set up hearts before clubs are set up.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|athene: if you duck at trick 1?|pg||
nt|athene: how?|pg||
nt|mariner1: duck|pg||
nt|super nova: heart and a heart|pg||
nt|super nova: so you win I take it|pg||
nt|athene: who wins the first club?|pg||
nt|mariner1: u duck one and hope|pg||
nt|super nova: I guess after you duck the heart you switch to spades|pg||
nt|super nova: hearts can't be set up.|pg||
nt|athene: yes but south can't attack spades|pg||
nt|athene: south had to duck the @H10 perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: leaving north on lead|pg||
nt|athene: so he can switch to a spade|pg||
nt|athene: that would be a great defence if it worked|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: actually i miht be wrong - south can perhaps just attack spades anyway|pg||
nt|athene: the defence eventually get 2 spades, 2 clubs and heart|pg||
nt|athene: this might (might) be possible to find|pg||
nt|super nova: Now he need to switch to a spade|pg||
nt|athene: if you know from the lead that west has a double heart stop ( likely)|pg||
nt|mariner1: well W is making S find out what works|pg||
nt|athene: partner can only have one entry with his heart suit so clearly it's hopeless to continue hearts|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|super nova: well done.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: well done- but the @S7 is too big!|pg||
nt|super nova: yeah|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: it had to be @S8/@S9|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mariner1: yes bigger @S|pg||
nt|athene: Hohor will be kicking himself afterwards|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|athene: to get so close|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|c7|nt|super nova: Another case for 4th highest |pg||
mc|10|nt|athene: people usually just return partner's suit without thinking|pg||
nt|athene: even when a simple count of the points will show it can't possibly establish enough tricks|pg||
pg||
qx|o5|st||md|3S9HQJ76D986CAT973,SQ862HAT842DA2CK8,SKJ754HK95DJ43C64,SAT3H3DKQT75CQJ52|sv|n|mb|1D|an|11-15 0+!D|mb|p|mb|1H|an|6+ natural |nt|mariner1: 1N looks like the spot|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|athene: 1@D shows 0 (or more) diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: hard to argue with that|pg||
nt|athene: west could alert his partner's pass over 1@D and explain that that shows 0+ @D as well|pg||
nt|athene: actually we have screens so self-alerting i assume? :)|pg||
nt|super nova: If south passes (unlikly)|pg||
nt|super nova: then west will probably have to bid 1nt|pg||
mb|2C|an|natural|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|super nova: but 2h is nice with the singelton.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H??|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1@D just doesn't count as a suit at all, so 2@C is natural and not 4th suit|pg||
nt|super nova: I think 2h is correct from N|pg||
nt|athene: east's delayed double has to show diamond length|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|mariner1: not the optimum spot|pg||
nt|super nova: I guess North feels that he didnt feel he has shown any diamonds yet.|pg||
nt|athene: north could have raised hearts right away|pg||
nt|super nova: ah.. better.|pg||
nt|athene: but failing that, 2@H over 2@C looks very reasonable|pg||
nt|mariner1: better|pg||
mb|p|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: the other room probably went 1@D 1@H 1@S 1NT all pass uncontested|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: i thought it was normal to raise on three cards with a side singleton|pg||
nt|athene: but perhaps you rather show the four spades|pg||
nt|super nova: A chance to pick up one imp here for the butler team.|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: well 1N was very calm in Closed Room|pg||
mb|1N|an|12-15 no 4card major |nt|athene: if 1nt is 12-14 they will play here|pg||
nt|athene: if it's 14-16 they will play game :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if it's 12-15, north might invite and they will play game|pg||
nt|super nova: 1n = 12-15|pg||
nt|super nova: just looked up thier system notes|pg||
nt|athene: yes, alerted as 12-15|pg||
nt|super nova: and no 4 major.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|mariner1: well they probably will not make 3N though|pg||
nt|athene: restricting your 1nt opener to a hand with no 4-card major? Culbertson tried that and had to give it up!|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S invitational to game|pg||
mb|2H|an|max with !H stopper|nt|athene: i suppose 2@C asks for 3-card majors then :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like to play 4 card majors and weak NT, so if open 1N I either have 0 or 2 4|pg||
nt|mariner1: card majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|super nova: 2c is range and stopper ask.|pg||

mb|2S|an|9 loser hand |mb|p|nt|athene: you might be better-off in 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S might make though if you can get the diamonds going|pg||

nt|athene: get a club away on the fourth diamond and guess clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 4333 hands have over a hundred losers, no matter how many hcp they have :)|pg||

nt|athene: 1nt rebid might get passed out|pg||

nt|athene: if west opens a weak NT, east transfers|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: but if we get the weak NT rebid, east doesn't rebid with 5 spades and balanced hand|pg||

nt|super nova: The strange thing about the ANC teams is that if you are Leading by enough.|pg||
nt|super nova: (by the way the ANC teams is where the winner of this event is going)|pg||
nt|super nova: you can choose who you play in the finals by loosing to the right team.|pg||
nt|super nova: However there has been many arguments in the past if this is ... well .. should you do it?|pg||
nt|super nova: for example in 2006|pg||
nt|super nova: Vic open was winning by so much|pg||
nt|super nova: if they lost to ACT in the 2nd last round|pg||
nt|super nova: they could have played them in the final|pg||
nt|mariner1: I have never practiced (on purpose) losing|pg||
nt|super nova: but they smashed them and played NSW in the final and got pumped|pg||
nt|super nova: so they 'could' choose to play |pg||
nt|super nova: ACT|pg||
nt|super nova: .Niek Van Vucht, Stephen White, George Jesner, Bernard Waters, Andrew Creet, Steve Carter |pg||
nt|super nova: or NSW|pg||
nt|super nova: .Andrew Peake, Murray Green, Kim Morrison, Marilyn Chadwick, Martin Bloom, Peter Gill |pg||
nt|super nova: NSW played and won easily.|pg||
nt|super nova: On the other side some people would argue that you should play in such a way so as to maximize your teams chances of winning|pg||
nt|super nova: hence loosing in the 2nd last match.|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: we are back now |pg||

nt|super nova: at this VUL he may have decided on washed out heart not to do it.|pg||
nt|super nova: 1nt overcall?|pg||

nt|super nova: so X can help get a penatly. Of course you never want to angle for a penalty and just to bid your hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: S either has a NT hand or long @c........and I have a kxxxx and not much else|pg||

nt|super nova: could this be a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|super nova: perhaps Ozenir is thinking how to get to 4h now?|pg||
nt|super nova: may be try 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder how he could have come to bid 2@H?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well as long as he stays below 6@H|pg||
nt|athene: even if you didn't play transfers you would bid 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: not 2@H sign-off|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he thought his partner opened 1@S, not 1NT|pg||
nt|super nova: If there is a really long pause behind the screen it could also cause a problem.. unlikly but possible.|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps west didn't notice the opening bid and tried to OPEN 2@H?|pg||
nt|super nova: pause could mean thinking about 6.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N makes|pg||
mb|4C|nt|super nova: with 4333.. and your partner showing good S + H you might go on.|pg||
nt|super nova: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|super nova: Ozenir working out how to put on the breaks.|pg||
nt|super nova: ozenir bidding 4d hoping partner will bid 4h|pg||
mb|4D|nt|super nova: and then he can pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|super nova: but his partner doesnt have a 4h bid|pg||

nt|athene: you would have to be very very sure the @DK was offside to give up the simple finesse|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: south surely could have bid 2@C over 1@S?|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose at V vs NV he decided it was more likely to help the opponents|pg||
nt|athene: since he isn't winning the auction very often|pg||
pc|d2|nt|super nova: I would have bid 2d with north rightly or wrongly. If you do ahve a fit then you can ruff some hearts in dummy knowing that they are not goign to be over ruffed|pg||
nt|mariner1: this should fail quick|pg||
