pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|dburn: well, West has started bidding them|pg||
nt|finch: East has promised 3@C, although having denied diamond support probably should have 4 now|pg||
nt|finch: looks as if 4@C is a self-cue for diamonds.  Either that, or Gerber.|pg||
nt|dburn: exclusion keycard Gerber for diamonds, one assumes|pg||
nt|thegarve:  3NT off in the other room , I doubt if 5@d will be doubled|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|dburn: five aces|pg||
nt|finch: 3NT went off after a spade lead, spade return, diamond to the jack ducked|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and a void|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|dburn: exclusing @cA, of course|pg||
nt|finch: EW are probably fortunate that everything else is going off |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: the everything else can only be 3NT   and that might make with a defensive slip up|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: i'm not sure EW have been on the same wavelength here|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|finch: South probably feels the need for slightly better diamonds to double.  It sounds as if the opponents are making slam tries|pg||
nt|dburn: they were doing OK until East raised what she thought were West's clubs|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|thegarve:  the 5@c indicates that, but it is not an easy hand to bid|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: yes, that's what i meant|pg||
nt|finch: I think West should pass 3NT.  She's had the chance to show a big hand with diamonds; 3NT must imply no interest in anything higher|pg||
nt|xenya: i totally agree|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe it was East's fault for not passing 2@d, which appeared to be her last chance for a plus score|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d7|nt|finch: I agree the risk is that East has e.g. Kxxx AKx Qx xxxx, but that is a 3@H bid over 3@D|pg||
nt|dburn: although I suppose she could also have passed 3@d|pg||
nt|dburn: or 1@d, come to that|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h9|nt|finch: while we are results-merchanting, East could have not opened a nasty 12-count with 3 jacks|pg||

mb|2S!|an|asking bid|mb|d|nt|thegarve:  Everton win penalty shootout|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dburn: 3@h certainly seems to suggest some artifice - a passed hand facing a vulnerable overcall ought to bid more than that|pg||
nt|finch: 3@H appears to be limit raise values (or more), so perahps South should have seen it through with 3NT|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5S!|mb|p|nt|dburn: still, I guess 3@h has good chances|pg||
mb|6H|nt|finch: this may well take more tricks than it technically should, because the defence will not have the right idea|pg||
nt|dburn: again, declarer has pretty much the same ten top tricks as in 2NT without a spade attack|pg||
nt|finch: in fact I think it makes a load of tricks anyway with no entry to the diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: she can make 10 with all cards in view, not sure about single dummy|pg||
nt|finch: best is to take two hearts before touching clubs, but in practice she might win the heart and play a second club at once|pg||
nt|thegarve:  she will probably assume a@s is with West|pg||
nt|ady: dont think 3NT appeals -  singleton diamond  and opposite a passed hand   10C makes the hand good in no-trumps|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: about 1@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: E: 2-suited with @d + another 4+ 4+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like West's double shows two places to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N asked E about wests X|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: E: t/o|pg||
nt|xenya: i would have never doubled with the E hand, but tastes differ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: marginal, for sure|pg||
mb|r|nt|mdgraham: stil, it gets you to your optimum spot|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|xenya: indeed, but i would have certainly doubled 2@S had it come round to me|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: everybody seems to have found an extra ace|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: this will be expensive|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm not sure N's bidding makes much sense (sorry)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|mcarroll: Same continuation in the Open - allowing it to make|pg||
nt|xenya: however the @D2 lead could be from a doubleton, so the @D ruff was not obvious to W|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|vugraphzpb: 1@d could be 1-suited with @d|pg||

nt|xenya: you bid 3@S, pard passes that, you pass over 4@C, then all of a sudden you go to 4@S ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: match will be close after this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, agree.|pg||

nt|xenya: but the safe rule is never to claim with a trump or more out |pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  burn claims better than bum claims - although hen written the words look very similar |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C!|an|3!S. inv|mb|2D|mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|thegarve:  good push from South|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  for e/w   looks uneventful     |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: considerate of them to play in five, in that case|pg||
nt|dburn: but that was a very good effort from South|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|finch: a trump lead could have made life interesting|pg||
nt|thegarve:  that would have been tough to find|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|finch: yes, particularly looking at fewer spades that you might have|pg||
nt|thegarve:  the quick 5@h indicated shortage in @s|pg||
nt|finch: yes, but one possible defence is going to be ace, ace, diamond ruff|pg||
