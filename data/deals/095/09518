nt|marlowepi: welcome back all|pg||
nt|athene: this board might get passed out?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, though W might open|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and S might in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all now we are  rolling|pg||
nt|col3435: hi geoff|pg||
nt|eggy: standings on www.cbai.ie/|pg||
nt|mamos: hi all|pg||
nt|sn00py27: hi mike|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|henryb: Mike, Catherine :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sn00py27: Good morning all |pg||
mb|3C|nt|mamos: can there be too many Catherines? |pg||
nt|henryb: never|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: NS system card on http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/systems/mcmahon-kirby.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: Play ball!|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: My Co-commentators are David Collier, Catherine Draper and Mark Horton and I am Geoffrey Wolfarth |pg||
nt|dburn: not much of an opening bid, those North cards, but these days almost anything goes|pg||
nt|ady: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: X = minor-major?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: hi good evening everyone |pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|athene: club lead will get the defence off to a good start|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi stephen - do we know the systems in use?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: not off hand...|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stayman was not out of the question|pg||
nt|athene: not only is it safe, but east gets to make two discards which might be helpful|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you were right in a way about the auction Bill. it was passed out. after the opening bid, that is :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes, stayman was a possibility with the north hand (intending to pass any rebid from opener)|pg||
nt|dburn: 1NT alerted - may be forcing, I guess, but about 2@c I am not sure|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: south is bidding a lot|pg||
nt|eggy: Just when West thought it was starting to look good|pg||
nt|henryb: then 2@h = pass or correct|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe South thinks it's a transfer and North doesn't|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case the final contract could be somewhat less than elegant|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk7: Your commentators are Marshall Lewis and William Frisby|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@S looks makeable|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk7: Player names please operator|pg||
nt|athene: south has a very nice hand, even if she doesn't have a name yet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: usually they make it through a few hands before they play anonymously|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a LOT off|pg||
nt|eggy: quite a poor bid by east on reflection|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: i can think of people who would open 2@C on that south hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi Catherine, Steve, Calle and Geoffrey. Havee fun :)|pg||
nt|dburn: not that there's much wrong with 2@d as a contract, but not by North-South|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  a bit of a push|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnc: Hi|pg||
nt|eggy: west almost guaranteed to hold 5 spade|pg||
nt|henryb: indeed: favorable breaks in all suits and @hA well placed|pg||
nt|mamos: whereas 1Nt would make so Catherine North has done well|pg||
nt|dburn: however, they seem to be on track|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: hi roland will do|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: a feisty auction and i am not sure whether this will be an objectively good result for the declaring side|pg||
nt|col3435: yes, how does 4@h do?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dburn: this ought not to make, but with the favourable red suit position East-West could make about 2NT, so no great harm done|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: 2S plays well. but 1NT can make also|pg||
nt|col3435: seems to me like it might come in|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: yes, there is the double heart finesse for declarer if she chooses to take it|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dburn: still, not so obvious for West to play a red suit ace now, which is what she needs to do|pg||
nt|dburn: although I guess @d3 might also work|pg||
nt|dburn: and might be more accurate defence|pg||
nt|dburn: the point being that by playing diamonds twice more, West can in effect create a trump trick for herself|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c9|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|roswolf: yes it may well but will e/w get there in the other room? n/s bidding i think helped|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dburn: but now she really does need to play a diamond, and not...|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|dburn: ...a spade|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rnc: South was quite happy I suppose when seeing dummy with 5 spades|pg||
nt|dburn: now, provided Cath Jagger takes the right view of the clubs, she can succeed|pg||
pc|c8|nt|col3435: I'd say West always had enough to bid 4@h after East had raised|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Let's suppose North cashed a top club and then switched to the jack of diamonds - quite testing for declarer then |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is all about the first round of hearts and cashing only one diamond before playing hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but she will surely throw a heart here|pg||

nt|marlowepi: zia for example|pg||
nt|athene: yes but 3-3 diamonds has the extra chance of a squeeze|pg||
nt|marlowepi: my comment refers to how to discrd from dummy on the spades|pg||
nt|athene: which would have worked there|pg||
nt|sn00py27: have I missed all the fun ! |pg||
nt|diumraid: ****  IN RUNNING LIVE LADY MILNE ****  N-IRELAND 53, IRELAND 49, CBAI 47, ENGLAND 43, SCOTLAND 42, WALES 36 *****|pg||
nt|mamos: 20 20 hand|pg||
nt|mamos: no one can make much|pg||
nt|henryb: after P-1@s-2@h-P-P can N-S get out alive? Only if S passes|pg||
nt|mamos: if East opens a 5-4 weak 2 ....|pg||
nt|henryb: of course E may open 2@s tartan!|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sn00py27: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: not quite tracy went for-800|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 7nt here for N-S if they want it enough....bringing in AK9 / J10xxxx isn't bad odds for a grand|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Henry|pg||
nt|lestergold: and hi Catherine!!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: what is everyone thinking about?|pg||
nt|athene: dummy doesn't have what West is hoping for in 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome Mike|pg||
nt|sn00py27: hi|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@H looks normal|pg||
nt|henryb: Mike. May your addition errors make little difference and your spelling be reasonable|pg||
nt|lestergold: no chanse of that Hnry and 2+2=5 in my maths |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hi Roland and all |pg||
nt|sn00py27: hi|pg||
nt|henryb: your favorite 20-20, Roland|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwww|pg||
nt|athene: although if north leads her partner's suit that will help|pg||
nt|athene: ouch|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: very hard to disagnose though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E took a real chance here...|pg||
nt|ady: tranfer to hearts     likely down 2 at 2 level|pg||
nt|dburn: may be one major, rather than a transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north was doing the thinking :) i doubt east had to think too hard about that one|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure the auction should be taking this long|pg||
nt|dburn: not particularly sound whatever it is, mind|pg||
nt|dburn: still, no one can ever double anyone for penalties nowadays|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rnc: This one will for sure be cheaper|pg||
nt|henryb: you are obviously not an accountant.|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i do have an oxford maths degree if it was cambrisge then id be able to add up|pg||
nt|henryb: Pender thinks she has died and gone to heaven|pg||
nt|lestergold: in oxford they only taught me how to punt|pg||
nt|mamos: horses or skiffs?|pg||
nt|henryb: there is a story of the CEO who wanted to find out what 2+2=|pg||
nt|henryb: He called in his economists. they said 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: without birth control 2+2 can equal quite a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i might have bid something over 1@C as east|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sn00py27: I thought we might get an idea on this hand whether they play weak or strong NT :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In these times many East's would open - especially with an eye on the vulnerability|pg||
nt|sn00py27: E/W|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this should be easy enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: probably better to play in 7D. at least you go off only one when diamonds break your heart|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D must be showing something like north's hand - and south ought to be getting mildly excited|pg||
nt|col3435: some convention cards at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/lmteams.htm|pg||
nt|col3435: N/S play "Acol with 5-card majors and a strong NT"|pg||
nt|col3435: E/W card isn't there but I think they play strong+5 too|pg||
nt|sn00py27: Not quite Acol then !|pg||
nt|ady: this wont make    but n/s likely to make 8 tricks in 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the aces will take care of partner's @H+@C losers, however those two cards are split|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|nt|col3435: well, yes. Seems like a contradiction in terms to me. But that's what they say.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: @SJ10 might be useful fillers...@DAK9 is great|pg||
nt|henryb: he did not like that, so he called in his information tech people. wait a moment they said, we will check on the computer|pg||
pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: understandable that NS are hoping to create some action given the match score. but that 5C bid is infinitely more likely to widen the gap than to close it|pg||
nt|athene: East will be disappointed to get only her top trumps from here|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: admittedly you don't want to bid a grand slam when there is a chance they might not reach the small slam in the other room|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, so down two may show a profit, but there are easier ways to make a living|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: i am puzzled why N did not respond 2D|pg||
nt|athene: a 6-card minor is shorter than a 5-card major, for most people, these days|pg||
nt|col3435: (it probably just means "not 2/1 GF")|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: i am sorry to say|pg||
nt|eggy: good defence|pg||
nt|henryb: back they came. 4 they said|pg||
nt|lestergold: good start for Catherine|pg||
nt|henryb: he did not like that, so he called in the accountants|pg||
nt|lestergold: east may well be endoplayed more times thanm she likes for her visit to heavan|pg||
nt|henryb: What would you like it to be, they asked? :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: EW would probably get another trick if W continued spades, but that is not too likely|pg||
pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: but there is more to it than that. 2D has the advantage of announcing strength immediately also|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: i think with all those keycards for diamonds, south should not stop below 6@D after north bids 4@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suppose N was concerned about a rebid of 2H from S. but is 2D GF ion their methods? not normally in these countries, is it?|pg||
nt|athene: well, i don't know N-S's methods, but i am assuming Acol-ish, so things tend not to be forcing :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think both N and S are guilty of underbidding here|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chessmaste: 1NT is comfortable, might be a more interesting deal if East opens |pg||
nt|roswolf: ah i am glad we have a translator on the commentary team:)|pg||
