mb|d|nt|xenya: hi Joe|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: and Ralf|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well  trying to understand these auctions at such an  early hour |pg||
nt|lestergold: 11 in eitehr major |pg||
nt|lestergold: presumably the heart response showed spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam on  finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: may be bid in open?|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 10 tricks in @h|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|xenya: well the pass looks somewhat dangerous to me|pg||
nt|xenya: but it's a difficult hand for NS to bid after 2@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: I certainly agree, but don't see much alternative.  Does everyone reopen with a x on the s hand?|pg||
nt|xenya: good question, too |pg||
nt|xenya: what are the alternatives? |pg||
nt|santyclz: Again, I would, but wouldn't like it.  Let's put it down as a system fix.|pg||
nt|xenya: pass does look wet...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But the @s is too weak. If he also had held  @sQ OK|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|xenya: would work nicely on this hand, but...|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: Why not 2nt on N? with a better @s he had passed on D|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|xenya: but onlt because NS's hands happen to fit so well|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|dT|nt|santyclz: As a 3rd seat opener, s was not required to reopen.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|sT|nt|xenya: good point, but S's hand just looks a bit to strong for a pass to me|pg||

nt|lestergold: grand on a two finesse|pg||

nt|lestergold: two finesse|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|lestergold: off on a spade lead of course whcih east might double for|pg||
nt|lestergold: two way finesse in clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: the bid may tell declarer which way to play it |pg||
nt|lestergold: 6h seems tlo ber a good and sensible spot|pg||
nt|xenya: he will hear more now i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well yes Shirley buit when the 5/0 spade break is discovered it will change the odds back again to playing east for the longer clubs which indeed  east has!|pg||
nt|lestergold: stil lets see waht happens an exciting hand whatever|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|lestergold: east has taken no chances and demanded a spade lead zat the first opportunity|pg||
nt|xenya: no...|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: very wise because west knows that it must be a void |pg||
pc|c2|pg||

nt|sybarra: that may be the only trick they take |pg||
pc|s4|pc|d6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: so the lead well done but the club has to be guessed i dso not envy the declarer here|pg||
nt|xenya: S probably dterred from bidding on by the vulnarability|pg||
nt|santyclz: Very restrained.  E-w may be playing a strong @c system for w not to make a try.|pg||

nt|xenya: i think NS did very well to reach 6@C here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If D after 1@d and not having bid any major and not 2@d as natural the odds are for a 3-suiter|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4h n/s infrangible|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: wll when they are 3/1 there will only be two heart losers on most layouts takes an unkind akTen sitting over south the lose 3 hearts |pg||
