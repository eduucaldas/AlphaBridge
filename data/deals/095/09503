nt|iain sime: Great start for Scotland in the other room here.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: North's 2NT caused the disaster. A balanced minimum passes after the overcall|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|iain sime: Normally a Pass by North denies three spades.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|nt|jtr: If they bid 4@h it may limit the damage|pg||
nt|greerm: the second double means penalty : spades : or game try|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: For me, the first double is penalties|pg||
nt|jtr: Against a weak NT|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|jtr: Same here probably|pg||
nt|greerm: and the second too|pg||
nt|iain sime: For me the first double is hearts or a hand which would have doubled 1NT.|pg||
nt|jtr: Do you signal to your partner which?:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Operator, please give contract, declarer and number of tricks on board 15 and I'll give you the code|pg||

nt|phil: by the way, declarer can place the @cK with South now (North must have @hAKJ, and will see the @dJ in a second) - but passed as dealer|pg||

nt|bobh1: he probably figured--"why didn't he strip the hand?" . . . |pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: 6 @C seems to be lay-down. South is end-played after ruffing @D - and he must "give" away the @H-suit. Now it looks like a show-up squeeze against North - and that will tell, who ...|pg||
nt|werge: is in position of the cricial @S Queen|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 5@C DBL made so a big swing to Galim|pg||
nt|werge: crucial|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|phil: looks like 4@s which will depend on guessing the club Q (or maybe a misdefense)|pg||
nt|werge: You get an extra @C-trick, if South plays ruff and discard|pg||
nt|werge: As always: 3 NT is the contract...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: yes, 3N is excellent|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|bobh1: declarer followed the Zia Bols Bridge tip of many years ago--if they don't cover, they don't have it|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mmmakela: 3 NT little stretchy, 2 NT enough imo|pg||
nt|mariner1: likely is down,,,,,, 3@H 1@D and 1@C to lose|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mcarroll: yes avoid the 6-4 fit|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|phil: only the commentators can reach it however, in real life, everyone plays 4@s :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|mcarroll: And now it all depends on finding @CQ|pg||
nt|werge: This is tricky, two rounds of @S - and a @D, this will bring E/W in trouble|pg||

pc|d9|nt|mmmakela: see the heart spots Rob|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|phil: I think East needs to rise with the K@d early|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh I missed one... right,,,,,,,,, 2@H to lose|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True - give up the lead in @D and the opps have to help declarer|pg||
nt|werge: When East rises with the @D K, declarer will know - from the NOT-lead, where the @D Ace is -. and make the contract, West is endplyed|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|mcarroll: Sorry give a @H|pg||
pc|sK|nt|phil: lose heart, diamond to King, diamond to Jack - if declarer plays for split diamonds, he can claim|pg||
nt|phil: right, strong inference on the non-diamond lead|pg||
nt|werge: He KNOWS, that they split - from the (I repeat) NOT-lead of a high @D|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
