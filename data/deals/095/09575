pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|dburn: but South will probably not have much choice - hearts are going to be the unbid suit, but the singleton @hQ isn't really a candidate|pg||

nt|dburn: though I guess clubs might not be a "bid suit" in this auction - not sure how many of them East has promised|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|pg||
nt|dburn: well, West has started bidding them|pg||
nt|finch: East has promised 3@C, although having denied diamond support probably should have 4 now|pg||
nt|finch: looks as if 4@C is a self-cue for diamonds.  Either that, or Gerber.|pg||
nt|dburn: exclusion keycard Gerber for diamonds, one assumes|pg||
nt|thegarve:  3NT off in the other room , I doubt if 5@d will be doubled|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|dburn: five aces|pg||
nt|finch: 3NT went off after a spade lead, spade return, diamond to the jack ducked|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and a void|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|dburn: exclusing @cA, of course|pg||
nt|finch: EW are probably fortunate that everything else is going off |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|ady: the everything else can only be 3NT   and that might make with a defensive slip up|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm not sure EW have been on the same wavelength here|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|finch: South probably feels the need for slightly better diamonds to double.  It sounds as if the opponents are making slam tries|pg||
nt|dburn: they were doing OK until East raised what she thought were West's clubs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|thegarve:  the 5@c indicates that, but it is not an easy hand to bid|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, that's what i meant|pg||
nt|finch: I think West should pass 3NT.  She's had the chance to show a big hand with diamonds; 3NT must imply no interest in anything higher|pg||
nt|xenya: i totally agree|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe it was East's fault for not passing 2@d, which appeared to be her last chance for a plus score|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|finch: I agree the risk is that East has e.g. Kxxx AKx Qx xxxx, but that is a 3@H bid over 3@D|pg||
nt|dburn: although I suppose she could also have passed 3@d|pg||
nt|dburn: or 1@d, come to that|pg||

nt|finch: or it could be invitational with the minors (that's how I play it)|pg||

mb|1N!|mb|2S|nt|finch: EW obviously on the same wavelength, as surely East is close to raising a sound overcall|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|dburn: not completely clear that North-South will get these to game|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|finch: good prediction|pg||
nt|dburn: since South doesn't have to have a sixt heart for 2@h in this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: doesn't North have an invite, if they play sound opening bids?|pg||
nt|ady: stopped short      surely worth 3@H|pg||

mb|p|pc|s4|nt|xenya: still N has a good hand -- the pass is questionable i think|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: is it? without a spade lead at trick one, there seem to be ten winners|pg||
nt|ady: well they have got a 22pt semi mis fit|pg||
nt|finch: yes, but only if you take the first diamond|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|nt|dburn: 1@h? is that some cunning plan?|pg||
nt|finch: it would a more amusing cunning plan NV|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|thegarve:  Everton win penalty shootout|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@h certainly seems to suggest some artifice - a passed hand facing a vulnerable overcall ought to bid more than that|pg||
nt|finch: 3@H appears to be limit raise values (or more), so perahps South should have seen it through with 3NT|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|dburn: still, I guess 3@h has good chances|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|finch: this may well take more tricks than it technically should, because the defence will not have the right idea|pg||
nt|dburn: again, declarer has pretty much the same ten top tricks as in 2NT without a spade attack|pg||
nt|finch: in fact I think it makes a load of tricks anyway with no entry to the diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: she can make 10 with all cards in view, not sure about single dummy|pg||
nt|finch: best is to take two hearts before touching clubs, but in practice she might win the heart and play a second club at once|pg||
nt|thegarve:  she will probably assume a@s is with West|pg||
nt|ady: dont think 3NT appeals -  singleton diamond  and opposite a passed hand   10C makes the hand good in no-trumps|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|finch: If West's double denied four spades (as it appears from the auction), she'll get a count of the hand in due course|pg||

nt|xenya: but the safe rule is never to claim with a trump or more out |pg||
mb|1S|nt|thegarve:  burn claims better than bum claims - although hen written the words look very similar |pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|4C|mb|4S|mb|5C|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  good push from South|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  for e/w   looks uneventful     |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: considerate of them to play in five, in that case|pg||
nt|dburn: but that was a very good effort from South|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||

nt|thegarve:  that would have been tough to find|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|finch: yes, particularly looking at fewer spades that you might have|pg||
nt|thegarve:  the quick 5@h indicated shortage in @s|pg||
nt|finch: yes, but one possible defence is going to be ace, ace, diamond ruff|pg||
nt|thegarve:  giving up a @c looks normal|pg||
