nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good afternoon|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: Let the match begin!|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello Liz and Geoffrey|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|mariner1: hi all|pg||
nt|panja: difficult to see why North played that. The only reason could be that it is not normal, so it must be good|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Martin, Shirley, David, Jack and Bob|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: and you can't get the contracts anymore either - 1@h at the other table isn't going to set our pulses racing|pg||
nt|galadriel: Transfer response then pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi roland|pg||
nt|Walddk5: our operator is Matias Rohrberg|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|bcallaghan: Danger of getting too high in spades.|pg||
nt|keylime: 2@d Multi to start from North|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi jack|pg||
nt|joest: hi Martin|pg||
nt|ady: first hand looks like 4@S n/s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening everyone and welcome back to Estoril|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@S either multi or weak majors|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Shirley Ybarra, Geoffrey Wolfarth, Jon Sveindal and Panja|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: at other table - North opened 1@h to show 11-15 and 4+ @s, so South passed it|pg||
nt|chen_xin: µÚ2½Ú¿ªÊ¼ÁË|pg||
nt|chick: possible to make 4@S, losing a spade and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|jbgood: good evening|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is sweet Isabel @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|vugraphzmh: http://www.quintonaipe.com/fed09/gpp_eq.html|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bcallaghan: 4S looks like a fair contract, but not on this layout.|pg||
nt|panja: 5@D is a nice contract on board 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: puppet will help here I think |pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: oops|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Not a good idea removing partner's penalty double with a defensive trick.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If 3@H showed his hand, he should not overrule partner's decision to defend|pg||
nt|idc: ok, my pulse is racing now, I admit that|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mariner1: EW can make 3N here if they get there|pg||
nt|keylime: good agreements needed here on where bids show stops or ask for stops|pg||
nt|ady: hi Jack|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Strange auction|pg||
mb|3S|nt|galadriel: Well, this makes the other table look tame|pg||
nt|idc: I'm getting a feeling that we are approaching 'last rubber of the night' territory|pg||
nt|chen_xin: ×ønsµÄÊÇÉòÑôÊ¥ÓêÌï¶ÓµÄ¾²ÐñºÍÑÏÇà|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Why does South prefer hearts to spades?|pg||
nt|sybarra: got here just in time for the excitement |pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: this is 16 boards from Shenyang, China|pg||
nt|chick: not so sure about that, panja.  a lot of ruffing needed and diamonds are 4-1|pg||
mb|3N|nt|panja: 3Nt is not as good..even with @S finesse there are only 8 tricks...but E must switch to @C at trick two|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt = 18-20?|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: friendly lead for declarer here|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup super first hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: the teams are currently in 1st and 3rd position - Jourdain in 3rd|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: the one that lasts for 3 hours and features many four figure penalties as the empty beer bottles build up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 800 on best defence|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Convention cards from  http://www2.bridge.dk/Default.aspx?ID=1374|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Nicely bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Isabel, welcome to you too|pg||
nt|sybarra: play wont take long |pg||
nt|joest: hmm|pg||
nt|cuttysark: There seems to be a tredn towards 2-openers that include a balanced 18-19.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 18-19|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: he will win @HK and return @H10|pg||
nt|joest: if 3NT is both, are there enough bids left to show one and none?|pg||
nt|joest: I'm sure they have it all worked out though|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C  puppet stayman for 5 card majors    2@D  shows no 5 card major   but both 4 card majors|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I was taught that was very dangerous|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|joest: I thought 3@d showed both|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Nut it has worked well here when C!Q drops nicely|pg||
pc|cA|nt|calabres: we have con problems, will be fixed shortly|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mariner1: continue 10@H.......|pg||
nt|chen_xin: ÏÖÔÚ³¡ÉÏÐÎÊ½¶ÔÊ¥ÓêÌï²»Àû|pg||
nt|sybarra: goes down on @H and @H ruff, |pg||
nt|sybarra: easy from here |pg||
nt|jbgood: S asked for a @d shift - couldnt imagine N had seven of them|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chick: 9 tricks now ... 3 spades, 1 heart, 1 club, 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|panja: we know @C lead would have been killing, but one can understand West not wanting to lead that after the 2@C bid|pg||
nt|chick: club lead would have given him much more problem|pg||
nt|joest: as long as they know.. :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|idc: I suspect Cooke in the other room will take this result as a vindication of his pass of 1@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: for an international event, this is quite a late start|pg||
pc|s2|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|roswolf: well still off |pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|idc: and no one will be able to argue with him|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's pointless anyway. He will tell you what's right and wrong|pg||
nt|cuttysark: A swift , slightly embarrassed claim, one feels|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chick: guaranteed to ensure that "night people" win.   morning people have no chance|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|keylime: declarer would have had some more work on a K@s lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Auction was perfect until the 3@H bid|pg||
nt|calabres: Hi all, please be welcome to the PORTUGUESE GRAND PRIX 2009 - Estoril (Teams). We are in 2nd day of the event, round 4.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|nt|galadriel: NS had a very good start to their debut weekend, with some good cards on Friday/Saturday|pg||
nt|galadriel: I hope they enjoyed the experience|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: claim|pg||
pc|cT|nt|panja: does the ciesta change the morning and night people division?|pg||
nt|chick: no, it's physiological|pg||
nt|roswolf: hard to predict what will happen in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Sorry Liz and Geoffrey, you went to the wrong match|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mariner1: would have to win 3rd @S and run 9@D to make|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Bill|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jbgood: maybe W will just bid a number of spades instead of going slow - and buy it in game|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You are in closed room of Konow v Koch-Palmund|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am supposes to be chatting danish?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: supposed to be I mean|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah sorry!|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No Danish there|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Bye all :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to John Møller Jepsen|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Also welcome to Henrik Røn|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Hi all|pg||
nt|mollerjep: This is a nice result for Schaltz....They wont get a bonus in the other room|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hi|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s8|nt|bjacobs: There was absolutely no basis for North to push on to the 3 level|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|keylime: declarer is safely home, but a shaky start to both pairs here - with the length of match being only sixteen boards, could be rather interesting in the middle stanza|pg||
nt|mcarroll: looks like they know exactly what they are doing!|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't know if Papi's rule:  "if they didn't lead it they don't have a singleton" applies to this.|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Maybe. Schou - BrÃ¸ndum also open 2C with 18-19 bal|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: not a lot between 4@S  and 3NT here       4@S   might have gone down on some hands with 3NT making|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||

nt|mariner1: well this is  round robin so a little lee way but not much|pg||
nt|werge: Another part-score|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  And DQ is, IMHO, the obvious lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4@H LIKE;Y HERE|pg||
nt|mollerjep: i think it's a bad agreement....but here it works!|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ady: looks like 1NT  e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: And Wales could well overtake England for the runner-up spot|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Part score battle here if E-W can find their spade suit.|pg||
nt|idc: I think Scotland had the luck Fri & Sat, with opps playing poorly|pg||
nt|galadriel: Shows that England has strength in depth|pg||
nt|mariner1: well we could see action here..........|pg||
nt|chen_xin: ¿´¿´µÚ2½ÚÊ¥ÓêÌï»»ÈËºóÓÐÃ»ÓÐÐ§¹û|pg||
mb|1D|nt|keylime: 1@c is precision, double is a mathe takeout for majors here|pg||
nt|chick: morning people are normally alert from about 7am to 7pm.   night people are normally alert from 3pm to 3am|pg||
nt|panja: y, what about those who are used to having a longish afternoon nap? ...is that why it is so late in Portugal? Is an afternoon break the norm there?|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: but against England you need to create your own luck to an extent|pg||
nt|sybarra: at a not too high of level (like 1) |pg||
nt|joest: the club guess is what thishand is about|pg||
mb|1H|nt|panja: and the lead might give that away|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I would have opened the South hand. 5 controls and 5-4 shape. What about you, panel?|pg||
nt|idc: ok, that's me 1-0 ahead on sporting cliches, someone else's turn now...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: the def may yet lead a @C to solve all problems|pg||
nt|roswolf: semi - psychic effort by west might have struck gold|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|bcallaghan: One level too high, but still gaining IMPs.|pg||
nt|idc: Yes for sure Roland, not even close.  As 11 counts go that one is prime.|pg||
nt|jbgood: difficult to fint the heart fit now|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this might be ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mariner1: 1N now shows positive response no 5 cards suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: The boys done good...how about that?|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: I would have opened, but I count an extra half point for each ace, so I would have had a 12 count.|pg||
nt|mariner1: N again needs to pass|pg||
nt|chick: nap can help, but not really change it much|pg||
nt|mollerjep: Schaltz is famous for there slams....this is NOT one of them|pg||
mb|3N|nt|keylime: 2H doubled, some action already|pg||
nt|panja: ah, did I spell it wrong?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this may have a problem on a diamond lead, as there is no quick re-entry to the South hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D lead came from the other side in OR   much easier then |pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: this has some play|pg||
nt|santyclz: They did that just to spite you...|pg||
nt|sybarra: cards sit rahter nicely |pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: well a club won't look so appealing after the dummy is exposed|pg||
nt|panja: after 4@D 's are cashed....I  suspect there is a rationale for placing the @CQ with North....|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: North will never learn|pg||
nt|roswolf: 9 or 10 tricks likely|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|keylime: it does if declarer is careful - this also has the danger of 500 all over it if the ball is dropped.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nor East|pg||
nt|mariner1: well E helps out this time|pg||
pc|h3|nt|panja: North is unlikely to hold a 4-card Major...|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|keylime: and declarer gets an early gift.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: all down to how declarer plays trumps now|pg||
nt|panja: so he could have 3 or four Clubs...not 3 or 2..so is more likely to hold the @CQ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mariner1: well it has lots of play now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|galadriel: Wish i could say it was still early doors :(|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|ady: will need to finesse twice    can do that|pg||
nt|panja: from either side...he can finesse twice|pg||
nt|joest: he can pick up Qxxx either way|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: only clue is the 1@D bid - |pg||
pc|hT|nt|keylime: I think he's got to tap the dummy with trumps here|pg||
nt|keylime: A@h and diamond exit appears safest|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1 @S gets ruffed and another on K@C|pg||
nt|keylime: closed room started with board nine so comparisons won't come for a bit|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch many vugraph rooms at the|pg||
nt|mariner1: same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need|pg||
nt|mariner1: Flash Player 9, some don't, Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North and East were both misled by their partner's bids on doubletons.  However, in neither case were South or West showing 3 card support|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: West more likely to have the ace|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mcarroll: not now|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|panja: y..so better to play small from South hand, isn't it?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bjacobs: Well I was told that the Open Room had English commentary, but maybe I am mistaken|pg||
nt|panja: @CT first time was better..now he will have to open up some suit|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h8|nt|sybarra: nice pitch of the @H |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South was forced to do something.  And West had passed 1@S|pg||

nt|panja: rather, with longer Diamonds, West is the one more likely to be short in @H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cross to a diamond and lead a small heart towards the queen - but North going down now |pg||

nt|mollerjep: It's very even....but my bet is Schou....also because of the carryover|pg||

nt|henrik_r:  2C shows majors and Rdbl asks East to bid the longer |pg||
mb|2D|nt|joest: second seat vulnerable partner should be reasonable so I think it would be conservative of east to pass|pg||

nt|panja: exchange @HA and @CA in NS hands..and 4@S will make for EW....is anyone surprised that E did not bid further even after 2nd seat Vul vs. fresh 2@S opening?|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|bjacobs: But not much reason to find the rabbinical play|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 12 tricks now |pg||

pc|sK|nt|mariner1: interesting lead from QJ @D|pg||
nt|mcarroll: There are traditionalists who argue that you never open 2@H if you also have 4@S|pg||

pc|sA|pg||

nt|santyclz: Basically has to guess @sj9xx in e.|pg||
nt|mollerjep: a trick blew away|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|sybarra: but I think their system is not the "traditional" weak 2 bid |pg||
nt|santyclz: Which is not unreasonable on the auction.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mcarroll: which certainly means that you never get to 6@S|pg||

mb|1D|nt|mollerjep: 4h?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|panja: ideally, @SKQ after @HK was ruffed..|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: To defeat the contract, North probably had to give away a ruff sluff when in with @CA|pg||

nt|roswolf: an ACOL2 - wonders will never cease|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Though to get there|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  And it also has no play I think|pg||
nt|mollerjep: and tough to win|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bjacobs: All too hard|pg||
nt|sybarra: S finding the bid "amusing" |pg||
nt|joest: so now if the panelists had a 'majors' call avaiilable here would you trot it out as east?|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: not me, I would need suit body..|pg||
nt|joest: put me in the 'yes I would' column :)|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Wow|pg||

mb|p|nt|chen_xin: 7dÒ²Ðí°Ñns¼·µ½7h|pg||
nt|ady: this seems comfortable    wsill probably try J@C   and when that is ducked  play spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: that beautiful play gathered 5 imps, as the other room tried 4 @S |pg||
pc|dA|nt|henrik_r:  I would have guessed that Dorthe had about maximum|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bjacobs: In theory, neither makes|pg||
nt|mcarroll: no problems now|pg||
nt|panja: this works out fine only because North has wasted values in @H..opposite a singleton|pg||
pc|d7|nt|galadriel: Seems no-one likes @Ss anymore|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Seems impossible to get to spades. I am lost|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Seems to be an anti-spade pact.|pg||
nt|mollerjep: peter is famous for winning these very difficult games, so....|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ianrei: I think the first X showed H|pg||
nt|galadriel: I always thought that 1@C (1@D) X guaranteed equal length in maj|pg||
nt|sybarra: well...|pg||
nt|chick: sure would be interesting to know what each player thinks these bids mean :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder if this is a bidding misunderstanding - apologies to NS if not|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Maybe Bowles' double showed hearts and Howard's a support double?|pg||
nt|panja: I can imagine so many hands where N would have 4 Spades and xxx or Axx of @H where 4@S would be odds on|pg||
nt|sybarra: N not letting S off the hook at 4 @S  |pg||
nt|mollerjep: comparison coming up and like I said 7 imps for Schaltz :-)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mariner1: 4@H has a playhas to find J@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not on that lead!|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 4@H is off now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a smart lead, if you think about it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The chance of partner being short is quite good.  And you have @HA to control the trump suit and give the ruff|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but it sure looks like it :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: oops|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: sensible to play what you play over a NT opening over an overcall as well, so 2@H here=transfer to spades  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like 2@h was (North) cue-bid (South) transfer |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I would expect to see 5 @S in dummy|pg||
nt|roswolf: another blackwood misunderstanding it seems|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mdgraham: I reckon South was expecting that.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: In that case the spade suit is lost|pg||
nt|roswolf: west should pass in sleep|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bcallaghan: My preference is to play the double of 1D as guaranteeing both majors.  These pairs obviously don't.|pg||
nt|mariner1: now to make|pg||
nt|keylime: this is going to be a challenge.|pg||
nt|sybarra: well ace of trumps or a cashing ace in spades |pg||
pc|s9|nt|ianrei: and west's X showed 3H|pg||
nt|galadriel: I'm with you Brian|pg||
nt|ianrei: responses to 1C are transfer|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but you lose spades when opener is 4-3 in the majors and responder not strong enough to bid again|pg||
nt|ady: this also a good line     spade entry|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mariner1: well can he make it?|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Schou apparently devalued his 18 to 15-17|pg||
nt|mollerjep: Schou only opened 1c on the 18 point hand... |pg||
pc|dT|nt|roswolf: now wst will be confident as long as there is no revoke by his side |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|galadriel: Ah, even after overcall?|pg||
nt|keylime: declarer will have to play desperate here, and the spade cover almost forces the finesse in spades.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ianrei: after 1D, X replaces the 1D response|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|galadriel: yes, I see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I understand, but I am entirely happy with a system where you may lose the boss suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *not happy|pg||
nt|idc: Playing a short 1@c system, I used to play X as both or neither majors - but whatever you do doesn't matter, as long as you both do it|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes the @S lead and play allows a chance to make now|pg||
nt|keylime: the fact that a heart lead was indicated and rejected, interests me|pg||
pc|s3|nt|brolucius: Hi ti the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was mistakenly in the Closed Room and missed the start of this deal.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|joest: time to 'cash out'|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe get a club ruff now |pg||
nt|sybarra: but E may not expect pard to have a @S|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Could be that the 1NT rebid is 15-18 and they only open 2C on 18 good ones|pg||
nt|mollerjep: going down for sure...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|santyclz: I believe 6@c can make but not 6@s on a @h lead.|pg||
nt|roswolf: at rubber bridge you should cash the ace of trumps immediately|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|bobholl: !next|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mollerjep: 2 down|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: Tor O Reistad suggests that 1@S should show both majors after a 1@D overcall if you play transfers. He has a point|pg||
nt|keylime: the fact that trumps are 4-0, infers more room for the diamond finesse as well|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|mariner1: now W in a squeeze too|pg||
nt|keylime: the 8@d is a key card now|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|keylime: I'm thinkin two more rounds of trump|pg||

nt|idc: ok, now this is a boring partscore hand|pg||
nt|ianrei: what do you di with neither major|pg||
nt|ianrei: do|pg||
nt|idc: at least, it is if you are from the other room, sigh|pg||
nt|keylime: two big scores for N-S |pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@D makes here, 6N makes|pg||
nt|keylime: and another slam coming here|pg||
nt|mariner1: that could be a big swing|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even if East's safe exit card of the @S7 had somehow been removed, he could avoid an endplay in the trump suit by ducking the @DK, as he just did anyway.|pg||
nt|sybarra: a real misfit here|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Could have gotten out for one down|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: With no major, you support clubs or bid NT I suppose|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Will Peter overcall 1NT vul vs not and with a passed partner?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: peter has bid 1n - ulrik is thinking|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bcallaghan: Bowles is armed with the right bidding tool for this hand.|pg||
nt|galadriel: we don,t do "boring" here:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Good hand for transfers ...|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@S makes here played in E|pg||
nt|joest: probably another 1NT deal|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a perfect fit club game + a friendly lie of the cards|pg||
mb|2S|nt|idc: My guess is that Murdoch though there was no way his 2@s was going to end the auction, and he could support @d later|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Quite likely to reach 6D, but RKCB may stop them.|pg||
nt|idc: but it didn't turn out that way, though I find it hard to believe West would pass his 2@s with a max for the 1@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Not an attractive 2@C opening, on such a suit at the two-level.|pg||
nt|panja: yes, but potential for 9 tricks for NS...the way the cards are|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: S is thinking 6 and hoping for 7,,,,,, should easily find out|pg||
nt|keylime: South not wasting any time here getting on with it either|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not much South can do here|pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not see a bid with S hand,  thinking might have been an overbid|pg||
nt|ady: 21 v 19     19 might play|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: pleasant little hand this |pg||
pc|h4|nt|mariner1: 5@S shows 2keys and Q of @D|pg||
nt|roswolf: also 4 of a major is ok too|pg||
pc|hT|nt|keylime: 5@s is two keycards with the queen here|pg||
nt|sybarra: can certainly understand why "we" are in 3 @C|pg||
nt|jbgood: Patrick Jourdain has been on the Welsh national team lots of times, and is the President of the International Bridge Press  Association|pg||
nt|santyclz: Remember this hand when you hear the old saw:  partner never has the perfect cards.|pg||
nt|mollerjep: a funny spade combination....you will always lose 2 spade tricks.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: When 2NT shows spades and diamonds, would it not be better to let 4@H be rkc?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Undo please|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: west will be sorry did not trow in    dont blame the opening with both 4 card majors|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mariner1: nothing to play..... 6 or 7 depending on lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: 19 may go down a lot :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mariner1: so making 6|pg||
nt|keylime: West wasn't going to bed with that ace|pg||
nt|brolucius: In standard Precision, 2NT was non-forcing. They are playing a different method.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bjacobs: Workmanlike auction|pg||
nt|brolucius: On a diamond lead, declarer can try to steal an extra entry to dummy (to play clubs) by inserting the @D10. Of course this is not very promising once the @D9 has been led.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|panja: still, after the @H lead, they might make 5 tricks...just give away a small @H when in next|pg||
nt|ady: now looks like diamonds not breaking|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Since it was not convenent to enter dummy to lead a club from that hand, declarer makes the unusual play of the @C10 from hand.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mcarroll: interesting line of play |pg||
pc|h3|nt|joest: good play|pg||
nt|ady: looks like down 3 on best defense|pg||
nt|joest: can work hearts and get out for down 2|pg||

pc|c7|pc|h9|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|ady: when the club was dducked  east might have tried a low heart    that would restrict to down 2|pg||
nt|panja: she is...rather|pg||
nt|sybarra: poor S,  just no good card to pitch unless they can execute the sequece perfectly |pg||
nt|bobholl: actually west can be squeezed :)|pg||
nt|joest: not if south plays her partner for the spade king. then she can release hearts|pg||
nt|joest: has to work out what's going on|pg||
nt|bobholl: if h'd thrown a @H |pg||
nt|mcarroll: what is called a self-squeeze?|pg||

nt|joest: right bob|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If you are playing with your mother it is matricidal?|pg||

nt|ady: 2C! inverted minor raise    at least the values to a limit raaise of 9 tricks|pg||
nt|joest: on a non-heart lead a slam makes :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: I confess I would have bid 3NT as West a few minutes ago|pg||
nt|mcarroll: that is far more than an inverted raise in my book|pg||
nt|ady: yes needs diamond finesse and club break     nice slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have opened as east - now he has a riskier entry ino the auction|pg||
nt|mollerjep: Ulriks nose is very big :-)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: is there an upper limit on inverted raises?  |pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: it seems strange to me that the '6th' team can win the Camrose proper|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N forcing @H raise|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL?|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes REDBL for me too|pg||
nt|joest: don't forget the spade split too|pg||
nt|panja: the deemed natural 1@C opening falsely encourages West to move past 3Nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: likely to be a push though|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bjacobs: Perhaps double showed hearts.  Anyway, North seems to have a natural affinity for the 3-level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I would be shaking in my shoes if I bid 3@C, but maybe it's just one of those things you have to do |pg||
nt|sybarra: Mike where did that orginate?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bcallaghan: Looks like 6D is down, where the far worse 6H makes, or even 6NT by North with the right view.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: England has won the Camrose Trophy on 47 occasions, Scotland on 12, with these two teams tied twice. The Republic of Ireland won in 2000, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008, whereas ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Northern Ireland and Wales have yet to win|pg||
nt|mariner1: I would have DBL 2@S with N here to show I had a good hand|pg||
mb|4S|nt|keylime: tricky hand here, slam on just the N-S hands looks good, until you factor in the layout|pg||
nt|keylime: North knows now in concept that their hand is nearly pure in context|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to show @D void some how.... and stay in 6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: haven't the foggiest|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: and 6 may be too much|pg||
nt|bobholl: S always start agressively :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N is very aggressive with the 1N sitting behind N|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not a bad idea.  This is a very difficult hand for N/S.  |pg||
nt|joest: this is the time for the aggressive lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: the layout is insanely favorable for six tho - 3-3 spades, and the 150 honors in hearts|pg||
nt|ady: some play unlimited Martin   at  least a limit raise to 9 tricks    but can be anything|pg||
nt|panja: all because of the std 1@C opening being termed natural.....this is not West's fault, as one might put it|pg||
nt|joest: hold on.  West does not have a blackwood call|pg||
nt|bobholl: well h'll gain now :)|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Ulrik could consider doubling|pg||
pc|c6|nt|henrik_r:  He has 3 CERTAIN tricks and knows that diamonds most likely are behaving badly|pg||
pc|c4|nt|idc: please note my new personal quest - to get all the web sites changed that have England winning in 96 and Scotland in 95|pg||
nt|idc: it is really the other way around - remember, you heard it here first :)|pg||
nt|keylime: 5NT is 2 keys without trump queen not counting any possible ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes a @D lead makes it very tough.... @c lead actually easier..... @S lead nuetral|pg||
nt|chick: actually, N may fear a ruff and play A@S|pg||
nt|chick: what?  the Rabbi's Rule?|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is what Ithought he might do |pg||

nt|sybarra: one of these K's should be right,  |pg||

pc|c3|nt|mariner1: no play for 7 that I see|pg||

pc|d5|pc|c2|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||

nt|roswolf: i suppose 3nt has a play|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Right.  You'd have to sedate me as East if I saw 1@S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Otherwise 3NT would be bid in short order|pg||
nt|sybarra: you were right Jack |pg||
nt|mcarroll: This could be interesting - the @S bids  may help to get to a slam|pg||
nt|ady: game bid will be fine for n/s  will get  back losses from previous board|pg||
nt|joest: I thought 3@s was an overbid.  Is east contemplating more??|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@S will be expensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: this has some good chances now - layout again favorable for declarer|pg||
nt|mariner1: can he make this?|pg||
nt|keylime: I think he plays East for shortness in spades here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: likely taking 9 tricks and home |pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Jacob-Ulrik play 1NT=6-11(12) and thus 2-o-1 is almost forcing to game|pg||
pc|d9|nt|chen_xin: Í¬Ñù½Ðµ½3s|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a solid gain for jourdain|pg||
nt|santyclz: I predict +1.  See if it's my day for the track.|pg||
nt|sybarra: hope so,  then Geoffrey and I will send you!|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol|pg||
nt|mollerjep: and 2nt is of course forcing|pg||
nt|mollerjep: and not like in esbjerg where it means: we are probably already to high :-) |pg||
pc|dA|nt|idc: yup|pg||
nt|keylime: so it looks right to play to the K@s and back up|pg||
nt|mariner1: he knows E has most everything....... except @S|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  I think that 3C would only be invitational after 2D, all other bids forcing to game|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bcallaghan: Declarer may prefer a low diamond from hand instead of weakening a side suit. |pg||
nt|sybarra: getting out of Dodge I mean |pg||
nt|ady: 4S   would not play badly|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ianrei: he's probably thinking of ducking the lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mariner1: needs to preserve 8@S as entry|pg||
nt|mariner1: well the K@D actually make this easier|pg||
nt|keylime: yep. has to unblock trumps to be able to work on the heart play|pg||
nt|mariner1: now he can surely make it|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: there was a funny hand once where an English international opened 2@D (Multi)   |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d8|nt|joest: in the other room, south opened and after rebidding 2@d, south heard a 3@h call from partner.  Partner thought it was a splinter; South thought it was natural. Hence 5@h four down|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Based on their convention card Jacob should finesse|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  9 usually promises one higher card|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  From 987x they would apparently lead the 8|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  But earlier we talked about who my favorite is|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: His partner, also an international, had a 2263 19-count, and decided that 2@D had to be a weak major, so he passed   |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|sybarra: gin for 7 something I suppose |pg||
nt|mdgraham: unfortunately the multi was a balanced 21-count.|pg||
nt|panja: thx all, bye|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx all we can wander to other table |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thabnks all, bye for now - see you soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzmh: We will be back in 10 minutes time ... ty all ... special thanks to our wonderful commentators|pg||
nt|jbgood: one lead that didnt give anything away|pg||
pc|h4|nt|henrik_r:  I think it is even money and that the match will be decided by how much we see of Hemberg-Schaltz and Boesgaard-Nielsen|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mariner1: now has it if he plays @S right|pg||
nt|keylime: smooth sailing now for declarer; they know the situation|pg||

nt|jbgood: long time since i was there Shirl...|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: This is an 11 count I would not open, but it's their style apparently|pg||
mb|d|nt|panja: we begin with a 50% slam for EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks to our terrific operator in Estoril, Portugal.  Job well done Isabel! @H@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianrei: they open all bal 11 counts|pg||

nt|chick: 50% in clubs.  in hearts, need a split of hearts as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks to our terrific operator in Estoril, Portugal.  Job well done Isabel! |pg||
mb|4S|nt|idc: Anne has already mentioned the NS overcalling style|pg||
nt|idc: I'd call it 'loose' - not agressive but loose|pg||
nt|keylime: EW also using precision is appears|pg||
nt|calabres: Hi all, please be welcome to the PORTUGUESE GRAND PRIX 2009 - Estoril (Teams). After 1st Round I will indicate the link to results.|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 @C fit short @C now ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: which is practically standard in China|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Good man|pg||
nt|sybarra: the other room starts on the  with 7 and 8 ... so we start first ... and you can see comparisons on open table|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N works EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: better be in a suit here I think |pg||
nt|panja: supposedly natural 1@C opening, but W does not know the big Club fit..so he goes through 3@S..|pg||
nt|calabres: As Board Member of Portuguese Bridge Federation I want to thank BBO and Roland Wald for the schedule of these broadcasts on Vugraph. My special thanks to all commentators on Open ...|pg||
nt|calabres: and Closed Rooms. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suspect this EW pair play 1@C as natural|pg||
nt|panja: it is only deemed natural....3 cards should not really be termed natural...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is not the best spot|pg||
nt|calabres: Among other reasons, but mainly to the worldwide crises, bridge was affected too, so we will have only 21 teams, and some of them made by people who started to play bridge short ...|pg||
nt|calabres: time ago, we all must be grateful to them in name of their love to Bridge. Ty to all players.|pg||
nt|panja: 13/4 is 3.25, so anytime you have 3 or less cards, you have less than expectation value ...so unnatural|pg||
nt|sybarra: not bad on a @s lead which now unlikely |pg||
nt|panja: South is unlikely to lead a @D against 3Nt...note that N did not dbl 3@S...so North does not rate to have @S honour...|pg||
nt|panja: rather unlikely to lead a @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mollerjep: This is the famous Ron-spirit :-)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ianrei: west hands not ideal for the reasonable 5C bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Worst possible I would say|pg||
nt|panja: rather odd that after a suit is mentioned, 55 fit in that suit is not 'FOUND'|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to my co commentators  Joe, Geoffrey, and Jon.  Always an interesting discussion and insights.   (all of whom not going to track)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|galadriel: 5@D on @HA lead...|pg||
nt|ianrei: better played by E - may get the HA lead|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Should go down. 3NT had more play.  Hard to guess.|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Not surprisingly I think 4D is quite OK ;-)|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  3D simply doesn't put enough pressure on the opps|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: Thanks also to my co commentators  Jack, Panja, David, Martin and Bob. Always an interesting discussion and insights.  |pg||
pc|cJ|pg||

nt|mollerjep: not everybodys choise but I like it too :-)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|keylime: and six clubs somehow comes home - might be too good for a Roland slam here|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: yes 6@C would make... how to bid?|pg||
nt|keylime: it's a push and shove kind of slam|pg||
nt|keylime: I know in my normal p'ship, we probably bail at five clubs|pg||
nt|panja: thx all|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3NT is a fair contract, despite the lack of points, because West is placed with all the cards|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: shrug, down 1|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Well, the queen is in the dummy|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mariner1: well even if he makes it he losed imps|pg||
nt|mariner1: loses|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Mind you, it needs @DJ to stand up ... and it does|pg||
nt|chick: I'm very surprised at the 3@S bid.   seems reasonable enough to bid 3@H.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is West thinking of cracking this?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|keylime: B2: CR - EW played 1NT after North overcalled 1H.|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Good thing he didn't |pg||
pc|d2|nt|keylime: I know with me after I hear spades, my hand downgrades a bit|pg||
nt|panja: all because of wrong terminology...because 1@C is designated as natural.....|pg||

mb|3S|nt|idc: but as a passed hand, North can bid a 4 card good raise 2@d, and stop in 2@s :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi all from famous transatlantic alliance A commentating team of Mike here and Chick|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Even though he has 17 hcp Ulrik should pass because of lousy distribution and @HKQ which are not very good|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|galadriel: They apparently don't play that|pg||
nt|lestergold: well n/smust bid game remains to be seen which one and whetehr or not they make|pg||
nt|chick: and Joe :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well 2cf double vulerable might be worth about a non vul game or so|pg||
nt|joest: yes|pg||
nt|joest: east will do well to run right now|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2d would be a good bolt hole|pg||
nt|joest: not that it's clear.  It's a guessing game now after the t/o double|pg||
nt|joest: btw, would anyone consider 1NT by West as being for the minors so as to forestall a problem like this?|pg||
nt|bobholl: would be a nice understanding but not realistic imo|pg||
nt|joest: West certainly wants to stop a 2@h rescue if he can |pg||
nt|lestergold: i would not be too happy with north's hand defending a 2 level contract|pg||
nt|mollerjep: a good pass by ulrik|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: and Joe too .... wow|pg||
nt|santyclz: Somebody has to do the comedy relief.|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  If I were to bid anything I would prefer 3NT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|keylime: B3: partial swing as predicted; six imps for a quiet 2@c partial instead of a push for the need to cash the club ace|pg||
nt|garnetts: Might get too high I suppose--but no good reason to|pg||
nt|chick: a good idea, but not without long discussion|pg||
nt|joest: probably true but I'm not sure that 1NT is natural or should be|pg||
nt|bobholl: bidding 1nt and than redouble migth be a good idea :)|pg||
nt|chthonic: After this auction -- through the redouble -- it might be reasonable to play 1NT as unusual.....|pg||
nt|chthonic: from west|pg||
nt|joest: i agree that the redouble makes all the difference|pg||
nt|lestergold: in 4s its not so easy for the defenc eto find a heart ruff|pg||
nt|joest: I'm sure n-s will happy to take the cash here|pg||
nt|chthonic: sort of a scrambling/unusual bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: east on lead why should he start banging down aces on air?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@C will go for 500 i think :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|keylime: at the other table, a precision 2@c opener landed N-S into 5@c|pg||
nt|mariner1: and the lead that helped on 4|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|mariner1: 4@S could be actually bid here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This surely won't be a push|pg||
nt|garnetts: shouldn't maybe but.............  :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 26 combined points hard not to reach n but it does not look at all promising|pg||
nt|joest: many would just blast 3NT right here|pg||
nt|lestergold: perfectly reasonable bid|pg||
nt|joest: i hate responding 3NT to 1@c though|pg||
nt|mollerjep: hello jesper|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: yep, that lead was charitable|pg||
nt|pentacon: Good ting for the match that its almost square|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|d|nt|pentacon: Hi John|pg||
mb|p!|nt|santyclz: Depends on how large and quick-tempered your teammates are.|pg||
nt|pentacon: Hi Henrik|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: Some people play Michaels as either weak or strong..would you call this strong?|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Thought I might see Michaels.  Want to avoid the trump suit that doesn't break though.|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  So Jesper who is your favorite ?|pg||
nt|pentacon: I'm with the local team, Schaltz and company ..|pg||
mb|r!|nt|lestergold: infrangible 3b here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|sybarra: this just doesnt make 4   good decision|pg||
nt|bobholl: if east bids 2nt now ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n i assume forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianrei: he must be regretting not showing the majors a round earlier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: uh oh|pg||
nt|chick: one of these days, I need to find a word like that of my own :)|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|garnetts: true was wondering 3 can be beaten--maybe not on that lead a trump would have been interesting |pg||
nt|lestergold: make one up Chick|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3@S does it this time|pg||
nt|santyclz: For those interesting in purchasing the rights to the word "infrangible", Mike is running a special this week.|pg||
nt|lestergold: who ll know difference|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|joest: i predict a push|pg||
nt|bobholl: still lead @H after this bidding ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pentacon: Hopefully Martin and Rico will play some nasty bridge the way i love it :)|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|galadriel: Oh well, he obviously thinks its too strong|pg||
nt|idc: if only the auction had offered a clue that suits were splittling badly|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: oh, wait a minute ...|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: I play any strength Michaels.  I like to get my shape over early.|pg||
nt|mariner1: DX just took the lead so this should bring it back to 1 imp|pg||
nt|lestergold: likely to be a push will lose the first 5 hearts and still another trick as he does not have 8 tricks without losing the lead|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mariner1: well 3N is out the window|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: Even if you don't, it's not too strong vulnerable opposite a passed partner|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ianrei: this hand shows why Brian is right|pg||
nt|ianrei: 800 against a non-making game|pg||
nt|galadriel: I think this is a clasical vul Michaels|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: I am not a fan of redouble here - you have a clear idea of how you want to bid here|pg||
nt|keylime: unless, they are forced to systemically|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|galadriel: 2 decent suits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Garvey bid Michaels in the other room|pg||
nt|galadriel: and gets your hand over in one bid|pg||
nt|keylime: CR also got to the laydown small slam, but earned an imp by not getting the A@c cashed.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|idc: Hmmm, I seem to be channeling the sarcastic spirit of Sam Leckie|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bcallaghan: Garvey managed to avoid doing something strange!|pg||
nt|garnetts: Is is still allowed to play a King and switch to show a singleton?   (rather than the Ace)|pg||
nt|santyclz: I like it at the 4 level and below (if not playing Rusinow).|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|bobholl: south is kind of squeezed :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well there isa double dummy spade pin but that ill never happen|pg||
nt|lestergold: how about 'undefenstratable'|pg||
nt|mollerjep: Nobody can do as nasty as you :-)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|idc: that in itself counts as strange|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: meaning it cant be thrown out of the window|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|lestergold: so is declarer|pg||
nt|santyclz: Too fat to fit through the window?|pg||
nt|lestergold: the word or me?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: 800 or 1100, matters little|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: A club would have yielded 11|pg||
nt|joest: can get out for down one if runs diamonds|pg||
nt|joest: criss cross squeeze|pg||
nt|santyclz: My guess at the definition of your word.|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bjacobs: Strange line but good enough.  I would have played on diamonds myself|pg||
nt|joest: but i doubt that will happen either :)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: icy|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean i see not the contract is icy|pg||
pc|cT|nt|idc: it matters for the 100 IMP difference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe it still will|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h6|nt|santyclz: Now he just has to guess the @ds for game, fair vul game.  |pg||
nt|chick: maybe I'll just use plain english after all :)|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: peter is asking for signals.|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Peter is considering whether to finesse in spadea|pg||
pc|s5|nt|santyclz: Excuse me, *she* ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: icy shoprter than infrangible|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pentacon: He will do the finesse in spades, his best |pg||
pc|sA|nt|bobholl: criss cross always easier with 52 cards seen|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|santyclz: There's one for you, |pg||
pc|sT|pc|h8|pg||
nt|pentacon: no .. :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|sybarra: hope watching the @H spots|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|bobholl: remembers first @S discard ?|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|joest: this is always embarrassing because you know you should know :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: rigth you are but still thinking :)|pg||

nt|keylime: this room now about two boards behind|pg||
nt|joest: spade game/reasonable save|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to our excellent commentators: Anne Martin, Ian Crorie, Brian Callaghan and Ian Reissmann|pg||

nt|Walddk2: inviting us to participate|pg||
nt|santyclz: Different styles.  In the USA many would bid 3@h with n.|pg||
nt|bobholl: by me that's natural :)|pg||
nt|joest: this is a bid I play as natural|pg||
nt|chick: natural for me as well|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: 4@H makes here suprised was not bid in Closed|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have a lot of sympathy with that|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w opted in open to defend 4h doubled fo 100rather than chalk  uop their infranguible spade game |pg||
mb|4H|nt|galadriel: Even the ones about Brian's shape :)|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Thanks everyone.  Looks like I've managed to support the team of destiny here. |pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@D not such a good save,,,,,, 4@S can be beat|pg||
nt|santyclz: Are n-s playing a limited opening system?|pg||
nt|sybarra: no clue|pg||
nt|joest: i'm heading to the dictionary|pg||
nt|chick: I figure if you have the other 2 suits, you have X for a good hand and unusual NT for a poor one ... no need for michaels type bids|pg||
nt|mollerjep: tough to get to 5d|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Being a passed hand I do not understand Dbl|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Why not simply 3@D?|pg||
nt|pentacon: Perhaps Ulrik should have bid 4Clubs|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|keylime: pressure bid of 4@s and the double was good tactics I felt|pg||
nt|keylime: force the opps to the last guess|pg||
nt|pentacon: Not perfect for a fit bid, but shows why |pg||
nt|mollerjep: thats the way |pg||
nt|henrik_r:  You could bid 4@C but it leaves room for N to bid 4@D|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  I would bid 4@D if I had @D instead of @C|pg||
nt|mollerjep: will he bid 6d? I dont think so...|pg||
nt|pentacon: thats a point|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: peter has bid 6d|pg||
mb|6D|nt|ianrei: thanks to all - been good fun this weekend|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 5@S a phantom too|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4 @C now :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: so2d micahels and the double of 3h showing a good michaels|pg||
nt|joest: infrangible.  good one!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianrei: 6C or D on the C position|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N makes too|pg||
nt|lestergold: i assume that n/s are playing strong n/t and kendrick has upgraded|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|keylime: yep, this is going to get the treatment|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Good practical bid by Zou there|pg||
nt|chthonic: Double here only leads to possible misunderstanding|pg||
nt|chthonic: Guess not|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: hard for west to value his hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 imp gain :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: it may be an upgrade too far here|pg||
nt|chick: that's a pretty hefty upgrade on 13 hcp|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  That serves him right for not bidding 3@D ;-)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|keylime: and CR bid and made 6@h for 15 imp swing|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes it was|pg||
pc|h3|nt|idc: team of destiny versus the stone of destiny|pg||
nt|idc: we certainly have sunk like a stone...|pg||
nt|keylime: now the match is much closer|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D in the CR|pg||
nt|galadriel: Yay!|pg||
nt|joest: if east overcalls 1@s and catches a raise he blasts himself into game|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: but west showed nothing at all so cant blame east|pg||
nt|chthonic: except for 4-1 spades, six clubs might have made...|pg||
nt|joest: it's often harder to gauge the auction when you make a two-suited bid b/c partner winds up making many decisions|pg||
pc|c4|nt|chthonic: if spades offered two discards and clubs 2-2...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|idc: that'll get it back under 100, phew|pg||
nt|ianrei: 6S only 500|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mariner1: making 5|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1NT can work well actually on this hand type|pg||
nt|chthonic: playing a part score seems a bit timid|pg||

nt|bobholl: drop @D :)|pg||
nt|joest: but it's going to pick up some imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: at some point patrick will finesse the club into the doubleton queen and roof will fall in|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|keylime: this will be 300 going the wrong way here|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is 8 or 11 imps|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|santyclz: That would be my choice, I'm not lawful enough.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well patrick wouldnt make a game invite with only two aces opposite a weak no gtrump|pg||
mc|11|nt|pentacon: No square match anymore ..|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  It seems that Jacob did well by doubling 2@D on the previous board|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: another minor brake of play|pg||

nt|joest: I think pass by north is losing bridge in the long run but that's just my opinion|pg||

nt|santyclz: A well deserved minus after n's foolhardy 1nt.  (If it had made it would have been a well earned plus after n's tactical 1nt.)|pg||

nt|chick: the victors write the history :)|pg||

nt|santyclz: Thanks Luis.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: N-S modified Polish Club|pg||
nt|galadriel: 2@C was bold|pg||
nt|joest: do east-west play a club system?|pg||
nt|lestergold: does north realise they have a mountain between them?|pg||

nt|lestergold: unless this is repeated in the open room , this could be a fair gain for the local team|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps the double will help him ... for example a low club to the 10 brings in 2 club tricks (as the cards lie)|pg||
nt|pentacon: Nice bidding|pg||
pc|hA|nt|idc: and I came up...|pg||
nt|lestergold: without hesitation|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|mariner1: 3N played well in Closed,,, and not even close to finding it here|pg||
nt|bobholl: chickken :)|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Yes well bid by Dorthe and Peter and now making after the lead|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|galadriel: NS play a very aggressive overcalling style, but they are young and adventurous|pg||
nt|garnetts: My guess is 2@D Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: was thinking same |pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: putting his pard under more pressure especially when he had a takeout double to staqrt with maybenot worlds greatest but he had one  in my book|pg||
nt|lestergold: 12 points and 4 cards in the other major i double|pg||
nt|chick: I think no question N should have made immediately takeout X|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you play ELC he surely had one :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pentacon: 9 tricks from start|pg||
nt|pentacon: 10 now|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Sorry one over trick. Can't count ;-)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|galadriel: Hello Ian @H|pg||
nt|idc: yes, last one I watched was JTxxx for a non-space consuming 1@d over 1@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I remember the BBO usernames of East and South. Boeles is gnasher and Gillis is Capercliff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bowles|pg||
nt|galadriel: Yes and that got pd off to the wrong lead|pg||
nt|galadriel: that is the danger|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, East found the one disastrous lead: @HQ|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: I wouldn't have overcalled myself, but it looks like it stopped EBU from finding the heart fit.|pg||
nt|lestergold: you double because you have to not because you like ur hand|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s8|nt|keylime: this will net some needed imps for SYT here |pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: well 2 cl 2h and 2d will be  tricks but e/wwill make 8 tricks before that|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2@c show @ds or big hand?|pg||
nt|sybarra: must be |pg||
nt|garnetts: I have seen decs play the ace and pick up the whole suit|pg||
nt|joest: I'll have to remember that one Mike.  I'll use it on my partner next time I enter on some marginal hand and we go for a number :)|pg||
nt|joest: but I already weighed in on behalf of double a while back|pg||
nt|lestergold: true u diod|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|c3|nt|lestergold: iwas just supporting u because its so important to underline the degree of underbidding here by north |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|joest: so just so I have this straight: 4@s = infrangible|pg||
nt|joest: I like it|pg||

nt|lestergold: tempo not looking good fro declarer 500 or 800 maybe|pg||
nt|santyclz: He should be able to get out for 500 now.  W needed to get @ds started.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: declarer is squeezed in a way if he discards dim then east can exit with a dim safely and declarer is behind declarer needs his clubs and hearts obviously |pg||

nt|Walddk2: A lot of if's, but if EBU can hold on to a lead around 40 (21-9), England must win the second half by 50 IMPs against Wales to win the Camrose Trophy. So EBU in a very strong ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: position now that England are 33 IMPs in arrears against Wales|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Not exactly a triumph when Gillis had a normal raise.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North is rawol and West is catch22 on BBO|pg||
nt|keylime: not something you hear normally..."plus 80, gain 16"|pg||
nt|lestergold: i always say that 1n is the most diffiult contract to defend|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: roland slam here frigid when qs appears and often frigid when they dopnt lead a club|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe too good for a roland|pg||
nt|chthonic: with 3-3 diamonds, this makes six spades without a club lead...|pg||
nt|bobholl: culbertson opening 3 quick tricks :)|pg||
nt|joest: i open|pg||
nt|joest: which isn't saying a lot to be sure|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mariner1: another barn burner here|pg||
nt|bobholl: i open 1nt if 12-14 nice hand :)|pg||
nt|pentacon: Wild west Board this one ..|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  7@D/@S for EW but not easy to get there|pg||
nt|mollerjep: 6 or 7?|pg||
nt|mollerjep: what about the diamonds?|pg||
nt|pentacon: 7S i fantastic, nine card diamond fit, entry on King of clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: CR opened this 1H, preempt raise to 4, got doubled, and they let TWO overtricks pass through. |pg||
nt|santyclz: This is an accident-prone hand.|pg||
mb|5H|nt|mollerjep: 5h and counting :-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: not sure where N thought their tricks were vs 4@S in Closed|pg||
nt|keylime: B7: 4@c down 1, but more imps to SYT|pg||
nt|sybarra: blasting into 4 @H?  I thought he would bid |pg||
nt|bobholl: no 6@S now :)|pg||
nt|chick: 1N is my favorite contract to play |pg||
mb|6C|nt|galadriel: This looks like a normal 4@S|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Looks like a diamond lead needed to break a slam.|pg||
nt|garnetts: Pass looks right to me over 1@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I guess as a passed hand ... yikes, off and running|pg||
nt|joest: I'm in a minority who likes to be able to bid 3@s on west's hand there showing extra length and extra vlues|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s easy make every card right|pg||
mb|6S|nt|galadriel: Will E X 5@D bid?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt it|pg||
nt|galadriel: I doubt it too|pg||
nt|lestergold: i open eastit has ak a i have to tell partner about this always in case oppos get frisky so partner can double them otherweise hell never bel;ieve i have three bullets|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes cosyou can play it badly chick knowing the defenders will defend it even worse!!!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Redoubled, just to make it interesting.|pg||
nt|chick: that's the best kind for me to play, where the opps make a lot of mistakes :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I was about to say you can have so many sophisticated methods for passed hand raises, 4@S here seems a bit agricultural|pg||
nt|santyclz: If it's right over 1@s, it has to be right over 2@ss.|pg||
nt|chick: I would think at least a negative double (intending to bid hearts later, showing weak hand long suit)|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: East's done well to find a bid and get to a good game bid here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not for my money--I am sure I would bid 3@H now |pg||
nt|calabres: Results at : http://www.freewebs.com/fpbridge/2009_Estoril_Open_Teams_R1.pdf|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Luis|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: I'm not sure I'm in love with a 3@d rebid|pg||
nt|lestergold: not automatic to bid game on these cards but theyll be sorry if gtehy dont|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: What do we know, Anne?|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H lead and @D swicth needed|pg||
nt|joest: this has induced west, not unreasonably, to think maybe diamonds is a source of tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: but what else P won't have 4@H|pg||
nt|joest: i raise to 3@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n an appaling spot iof thats where they play but cant fil today|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant fail today|pg||
nt|pentacon: 6H from Ulrik first time ?|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Tough. Jacob has aces, but no tricks. Ulrik has tricks but no aces|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  My guess is that 4@S has a very wide range in their style|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bobholl: may be the 2@C cues will win the board :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|galadriel: Not alot apparently :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mariner1: well J@C is not the optimum lead|pg||
nt|joest: indeed.  West is screaming for a heart control|pg||
nt|lestergold: this cue bid will prepare then drfence to beat the slam they look like they are headed for|pg||
nt|joest: south's pass of 5@h is big|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean they are leading a club whatever|pg||
pc|s5|nt|idc: I think Gillis has done enough already, 5@h seems like overegging the pudding|pg||
nt|galadriel: Grand slam try froms?|pg||
nt|lestergold: no they are in the sensible spot of 4s but all three agmes infrangible tody|pg||
pc|s2|nt|garnetts: I quite like the initial pass and bidding later if apt |pg||
nt|santyclz: After the opponents have shown no fit?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think I would have found a double at the table. What about you guys and gal?|pg||
nt|bobholl: we would seeing 52 cards :)|pg||
nt|joest: and now the 3@d rebid comes home to roost|pg||
nt|lestergold: well well|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D are 33 :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: club club fin ishes this one off|pg||
pc|sT|nt|galadriel: Not me|pg||
nt|galadriel: I have 2 other aces|pg||
mc|13|nt|idc: not with that @d suit.   Add in 2 side suit Aces and even less chance|pg||
nt|galadriel: Successful here though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Devastating if you are a Scotland supporter|pg||
nt|galadriel: yep|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: I thinks Bowles did very well here.  With two side aces either making or not, he tried to get a diamond established.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: interesting|pg||
nt|joest: now another club tapping dummy shuts out the spade suit|pg||
nt|santyclz: Don't remember when I've seen so many cards well placed.|pg||

nt|calabres: another fhantom slam :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it seems to be the season for non making slams|pg||

nt|mollerjep: another freak deal...|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  But this makes the match more interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|bcallaghan: 6S looks like a good spot here.|pg||
nt|pentacon: Another Grandslam :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mcarroll: no reason to bid 6 on these cards!!|pg||
nt|joest: i can only describe the open room bidding as 'exuberant' :)|pg||
nt|calabres: in Open they havnt made blackwood:(|pg||
nt|lestergold: auction in closed decided for no discernible reason to do a blacwood bypass|pg||
nt|bobholl: MY 4@D bid 11-15 splinter :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i meant open|pg||
nt|santyclz: And the 2nt-whatever.|pg||
nt|lestergold: uve been reading too much Wald|pg||
mb|1H|nt|idc: yes - but always tough to bid a good slam when you have just bid a .... less than good one|pg||
nt|keylime: I am sure that Ligong are going to be shellshocked over the comparions|pg||
nt|lestergold: and in op0en |pg||
mb|1S|an|.|nt|mariner1: 4@S does not play well too much off|pg||
nt|keylime: comparisons I meant|pg||
nt|lestergold: its what happens after the pslinter which is interesting|pg||
nt|joest: it's very important to have limited ranges on your splinters.  If you don't East can get too excited.  Or even worst the splinterer might come again at the five level and wind up ...|pg||
nt|joest: going down|pg||
nt|bobholl: not discussed what pass now means :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree Jack with limited strength splinters|pg||
nt|joest: I would think pass shows interest without a descriptive bid. Certainly interested in hearing a spade cue|pg||
mb|2H|nt|santyclz: E-w made 3nt on the 1ntx'd bd, but they were only in 1.|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|nt|henrik_r:  1@S promises 5@S|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Dbl by S is most likely extra values without a good bid|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Now N is fixed because she did not set @D as trumps on the previous round|pg||
nt|mollerjep: would you have done that?|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Maybe, but 1@S could have been the right bid|pg||
mb|4H|nt|henrik_r:  You "know" that your aggressive opps are likely  to bid alot of hearts before it is your turn again |pg||
mb|p|nt|mollerjep: spade is ok as trump|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Don't they bid 2nd round controls I wonder|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The lack of 4@H|pg||
nt|idc: 1NT 15-17, 4@c unclear|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a bad save if its not a phantom|pg||
nt|pentacon: Void splinter in hearts on the first round ?|pg||
mb|6D|nt|sybarra: this could be touch and go,  @C lead  is more difficult |pg||
nt|sybarra: aha|pg||
nt|lestergold: well sanity remained in the closed room|pg||
nt|mcarroll: good bidding imho|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot ofm work to do in 4s if defence find ace of clubs lead and then ruff killing thye clubs suit then it snot all chopped liver|pg||
mb|p|nt|henrik_r:  But @DAKxxx is all you need for slam in @D and how are you going to get your partner to coorporate now?|pg||
nt|mollerjep: she dont need coorporation :-)|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Yes but if partner had singleton spades and @DAKxxx and @CK how would I ever find out?|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  But I would most likely have bid spades at the table as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3 boards to play,,,,, next session scheduled for 32 minutes from now|pg||
nt|joest: Adventures in Slam Bidding|pg||
nt|pentacon: Lars and Morten Bid 7S on the previous board!|pg||
mb|p|nt|bcallaghan: Presumably 4C a cue.  Maybe 3H a genral slam try in spades works better.  Don't know their methods.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree Brian, and let 4m be a splinter|pg||
nt|sybarra: just guess the @D's for one loser |pg||
nt|santyclz: I see 8, doesn't anyone see a 9th?|pg||
nt|sybarra: @H's come home |pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think kelsy and ottlik would have written about these adventures|pg||
nt|mollerjep: I will never bid 6 small diamonds before AQJ10x|pg||
pc|h5|nt|idc: i expect you are right Brian - if 4@c were a splinter, the South hand has improved, if not, I prefer his 4@s signoff|pg||
nt|keylime: this hand is down off the hope a bunch on the heart lead|pg||
nt|keylime: at least one that I see, likely two|pg||
nt|pentacon: Peter only shows three clubs opening 1D, |pg||
pc|d2|nt|santyclz: Yes, would be a bad hand for udca on the @c lead.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Finally some IMPs to Scotland. Must be your presence, Ian|pg||
nt|idc: though trumps are so good I might go for 4@h amyway|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: The main danger was that trumps weren't solid enough.  Not sure they addressed that, but OK here.  |pg||
nt|idc: thx Roland but the reality is once I start talking about bridge, the other Scottish players just *seem* better :)|pg||
nt|galadriel: I think N just decided he was going to be in slam when his pd showed a @S fit, and to be fair, he does have a nice hand|pg||
nt|idc: Interesting auction in other room - transfer to @s and then a forcing 3@s bid by North|pg||
nt|idc: (they transfer with 4+ suits on some hand types) - presumably that invited South to cue but he didn't, and 4@s it was|pg||
nt|pentacon: three diamonds , sry|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: That diamond again, says Gillis to himself|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Presumably, in the other room, 4S meant somethin.  Good trumps?  Otherwise 3NT an alternative.|pg||
nt|garnetts: well the spades do let you get two tricks --not that you would look for them--but too slow anyway|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mollerjep: Brøndum took the save...but then the brothers bid it!!! |pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: Kendrisk wants to avoid losing more than one diamond|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|idc: would be good to know what 4@s meant - if good trumps North really should go on, if min and not interested ... well, North still might try|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he a small chance however line is not likely|pg||
nt|keylime: wow. did that just happen?|pg||
nt|keylime: I think declarer's got half a play for this now|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|garnetts: @D to the 9 looks normal|pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: anyone open the S hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 11 tricks in clubs in open but should only be ten tricks here no game|pg||

nt|mollerjep: they will not bid this one...|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  With Dorthe and Peter you never know...|pg||
mb|2C|an|nf stayman|nt|chick: I think it's a guess ... as Joe says you need 2 honors onside, but which two you can't tell, so mentally flip a coin for the 9 or J|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Maybe 11|pg||
nt|lestergold: automatic i would have thought but patrick is a senior tory|pg||
nt|chick: now N thinks partner has longer spades, weaker hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: too right Chick|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 3s thye limit for them|pg||
nt|santyclz: Fit jump?|pg||
nt|lestergold: kendrick will pass|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  But I tend to agree with you|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|galadriel: 11 even|pg||
nt|lestergold: troubloe is kendrick would have passed with a slightly better hand when game was on|pg||
nt|mollerjep: and its a very lucky 3nt|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sybarra: this is a brutal hand |pg||
nt|santyclz: Since it doesn't matter, take the play that gains if all 3 are on side.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: e/wat green have sopld out prematurely|pg||
mb|3N|nt|keylime: the dummy is not much of comfort for declarer - the heart suit is a lacking of a fourth trump a potential bother|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would have doubled directly (lower level lesser risk after pass )|pg||
nt|mcarroll: nice balancing dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: how to play the @S......  normally one thinks S has more dues to 3@D call|pg||
nt|chick: that's a good thought :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: yes as a passed hand, you wouldn't be overstating your values by doubling on the prior round|pg||
nt|mollerjep: as you say :-)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mariner1: and of course he needs to ruff out the @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: i know e/w are not vulnerable but i feel east had done en uf on his 4 count|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|santyclz: Sometimes the glass *is* half full.|pg||
nt|chick: this looks to be down at least 1, maybe 2|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am not sure I like 4@D  unless it showed 5/5|pg||
nt|santyclz: Does everyone play negative x's on that auction?|pg||
nt|garnetts: double for takeout maybe|pg||
nt|santyclz: If not, 4@d is kind of forced.|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@H forcing?|pg||
nt|joest: but THE LAW commands it! :)|pg||
nt|chick: why risk pushing them to a makeable game? :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: certainly the jump to 3s put west under a lot of pressure too much to bear including the fear that a 4c bid may have driven n/s into a makeable vulnerable game|pg||

nt|henrik_r:  Looks like an IMP or two for Schou|pg||
pc|c9|nt|idc: Interesting 1@h overcall from Howard - when you play very agressive style, that hand is too good/defensive for a weak jump at these colours|pg||
nt|lestergold: patrick cant draw trump without losing control|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mariner1: averaging 8 imps a board so far..........|pg||

nt|lestergold: my law of total tricks says that 4 points plus a minimum opening bid does not generally produce 9 total tricks|pg||
nt|joest: actually at these colors you get a good score for 3@h at matchpoints if they don't find the double|pg||
nt|chick: the LoTT does not say it will|pg||
nt|lestergold: Chick i know the law im just failing to be funny|pg||
nt|chick: it says that if it doesn't, the opponents have more|pg||
nt|chick: ookkkaaayyyyyyyy :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: But will it matter with e pitching all the @cs.  Still only -1.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: as lone spec says the la is about when you have about half the deck|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe west with 5 spades even tho small should not have been that scared of a spade game|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|idc: so I'm with his 1@h - in a different partnership, it would be a 2@h bid|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s3|nt|santyclz: Wd,|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|keylime: and now is down in a somewhat tricky but makeable contract|pg||
nt|mariner1: and still the average continues|pg||
nt|keylime: I think you have to assume the best there - 3/2 trumps and clubs not adverse|pg||
nt|chick: E probably expected longer spades too, and didn't imagine the forcing would work|pg||
pc|c7|pc|hT|pc|h5|mc|11|nt|pentacon: Nice save by Dorthe and Peter |pg||

nt|mariner1: this is the last board of this session........ next session in 21 minutes|pg||
nt|keylime: 123 imps in 15 boards is a lot|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is last hand of this set |pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks to our terrific operator in Estoril, Portugal.  Job well done Isabel! |pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to my co commentators  Joe Shair, David Carlisle and Cornelia Yoder  |pg||
nt|vugraphzmh: ty to our wonderful commentators :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to the Portugese Bridge Federation and Luis Correia for bringing this wonderful tourney to bbo. |pg||
nt|bobholl: made ???|pg||
nt|lestergold: uin any case soem miracle they made it|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  No. The first push of the match...|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: 9 to win the first round anyone?|pg||
nt|idc: or the 10 ... 10 i think|pg||
nt|mariner1: a big THANKS! to Unknown (China), our superb operator, for doing an excellent|pg||
nt|mariner1: job!!!|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|nt|chthonic: No, it is not related to having points.|pg||
nt|joest: south swung the ace of diamonds|pg||
mb|r|mb|1S|nt|lestergold: well nm/s overboard in open|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  A lot of IMPs have exchanged hands on some tricky boards|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bcallaghan: I would have tried to get to 2C with the South hand.  Maybe it's Stayman.|pg||
nt|idc: in 1NT doubled, even more fun - East leads a small @d, later run of diamonds puts West hand under some pressure|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: I think top diamond lead.|pg||
nt|sybarra: And to our specs,-- greatest audience in the world.  We appreciate you comments and thoughts|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Nah bob  1 down|pg||
nt|bobholl: still 2@S a@C 2@D |pg||
nt|joest: 5@h will not be the winner|pg||
nt|lestergold: well so far we are in a par contract a rare sight to behold in the current climate|pg||
nt|bobholl: stay fixed !!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|keylime: as we finish up, we wish to thank the CCBA and the Shenyang Bridge Association for this event|pg||
nt|joest: cash is still just as good now as it was on board 9 :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is 3d?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Fit bid presumably|pg||
nt|lestergold: if i was his partner i would certainly have a fit|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  This board is a potential swing for Schaltz as Schou-BrÃ¸ndum got to 3NT as NS and lost the obvious 5 tricks|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Right, they could easily be running|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And if not, still hope that @SK is an entry|pg||
nt|idc: true, but that takes away the fun, just a boring -1 i think|pg||
nt|mariner1: many thanks to all the organizers and sponsors, the CBF and all for helping BBO|pg||
nt|mariner1: bring us the vugraphs!|pg||
nt|keylime: also, a big thanks to my tag team partner, Rob Brown, from the Pacific NW|pg||
nt|calabres: We will return in about 15/20 min, ty|pg||
nt|sybarra: we will be back after a short break |pg||
nt|santyclz: And thanks to Shirley as well.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Fourth suit forcing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Thanks everyone |pg||
nt|lestergold: yeh normality afrrives on board 16!!|pg||
nt|mollerjep: but a very exiting set of boards...and I guees this will be tight all the way|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Dbl??|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bcallaghan: West may still be squeezed.|pg||
nt|idc: looks like SOuth could pass to get a forced XX, then run to 2@c to show 5|pg||
nt|idc: no idea either why he didn't|pg||
nt|keylime: to Roland our fearless leader of all things vugraph|pg||
nt|mariner1: thank you Dwayne|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: to Fred, our patron of bridge|pg||
nt|pentacon: øhh|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  He knows they have a 11 card diamond fit|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  and that partner has a (sub)minimum opener|pg||
mb|3N|nt|santyclz: Clearly an unjustifiable overbid without the @d7.|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: SYT will be feeling really good heading into the finals I think|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  It is clearly T/O, but still a little strange|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: much more competitive here than in the OR|pg||
nt|chick: hehe|pg||
nt|lestergold: well how on earth a hand bristling with queens and jacks found anything more than a courtesy raise puzzles me|pg||
pc|cA|nt|joest: so this will wind up as a 1 imp differential to Lara|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|bcallaghan: Provided declarer plays spades - one down.|pg||
nt|galadriel: Strange..partners don't like it when you squeeze them...and like it less when you endplay them!|pg||
nt|mariner1: we end on what appears to be a quiet board...........|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|idc: I suppose 4 hcp opposite 15-17, gamble on it making isn't so weird, down in the match etc|pg||
nt|keylime: they capitalized on a lot of errors,and for the most part stayed out of trouble|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  And our 2nd push of the match|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|sybarra: K!!!|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|lestergold: unhlucky i agree to fuind that his sole valuable asset his stiff club is opposite patrick's acerlessside suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: acerlessside|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mike inventing new words all the time|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry arseless|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear i mean aceless|pg||
nt|santyclz: We're trying to develop a new word for Chick to liscence.|pg||
nt|lestergold: Kendrick inventing new bids akll the time i only words|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d2|pc|c5|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d7|nt|chick: This is the last board of this match.   I want to thank our excellent vugraph operator, Isabel Correia, for a great job!  :)|pg||
pc|cQ|mc|8|nt|santyclz: Cash the @sa before taking the ruff?|pg||
