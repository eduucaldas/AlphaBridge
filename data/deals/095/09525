nt|jbgood: Hello all - a poweful start to this 3rd session|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: North may not have a weak-2@D available (and even if he does, 3@D is more fun)|pg||
mb|3N|an|min bal|nt|athene: normal weak-2@D isn't so popular in Australia|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|athene: well, without the 3@D bid declarer might have tried for a diamond ruff in dummy as the tenth trick|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|patricck: a good point, and maybe it isn't such an outlandish idea|pg||

nt|royhughes: Braithwait-Haughie play a fairly standard 5-card major system|pg||
nt|mariner1: looks like only part scores here|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S 1N 2@H 2@S uncontested isn't impossible|pg||
nt|athene: but south might do a bit more than pass throughout|pg||
mb|1S|nt|frankaus: both these pair - live in different cities - |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: Chan-Lusk describe their system as Acol, but also with 5-card majors|pg||
nt|patricck: well South will WANT to do more than pass, but on that auction what else can you do?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|royhughes: It would seem that NS are likely to get to 4H here|pg||
nt|athene: squirm and wriggle?|pg||
nt|jbgood: is N too strong to bid 1 NT in their methods, or ...?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: he will feel happier now :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: conservative pass by S , even with a poor @H suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 2@S F is my choice here|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|royhughes: With the heart queen offside, it is off 4 tricks|pg||
nt|royhughes: so long as the defence doesn't have an accident|pg||
nt|royhughes: If they start with a spade, for example, they might have to shift to their clubs|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think a diamond lead might be considered normal|pg||
nt|frankaus: klinger - sydney, Hoffman - Canberra|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: The other suits look unappealing to me, but Braithwait chooses a spade|pg||
nt|athene: the internet makes certain pairings possible which would be a bit impractical otherwise, for sure|pg||
nt|frankaus: Mewman - sydney - Christie - perth|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: *Newman|pg||
nt|patricck: some will overcall, some will not, depends on style, but looks fairly aggressive vul vs not|pg||
nt|athene: hard to practice when your regular partner lives about four time zones away :)|pg||

nt|royhughes: Chan opened somewhat light -- will he do so again?|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think most players would open the South hand in today's game|pg||
nt|frankaus: runner up getting 2nd choice of the trips this year - PABF or WC |pg||
nt|jbgood: hi, early morning here, Gary:) |pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|royhughes: It has some shape, good spots and 2 quick tricks, but it isn't enough for Chan|pg||
nt|frankaus: interested in view on this|pg||
nt|athene: you might reach 6@S here if in aggressive mood, but you will regret it this time|pg||
nt|mariner1: a Quack away from SLAM NS|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nice Sunday afternoon here Jon :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|royhughes: Lusk throws in a 4-card overcall|pg||
mb|r|nt|royhughes: NS have a play for four spades, but not with the trump king wrong|pg||
nt|royhughes: 3@c must be a raise of some kind|pg||
nt|jbgood: a nice sunny morning here|pg||
mb|3C|nt|royhughes: Chan gives a good description with a splinter raise|pg||
nt|royhughes: EW do best to let the opponents play, doubled or not|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi All from the venue|pg||
nt|royhughes: Hi David|pg||
nt|davidstern: This event is to qualify one team (2nd) to the PABF Zone 6 playoffs where Zone 7 compete as invitees and one team for the Seniors Bowl in Sao Paulo|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@C presumably a diamond raise of some sort - perhaps limit|pg||
nt|frankaus: miserable and raining in sydney|pg||
mb|d|nt|davidstern: I like the 1@S overcall by North but know it isn't everybody's cup of tea|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D (a reverse) would be forcing, so 3@D is clearly a splinter|pg||
nt|mariner1: so 3@D here meant as a splinter|pg||
nt|athene: some might play 3@D = singleton, 4@D = void|pg||
nt|athene: but clearly not this NS pair|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Man Overboard|pg||
nt|jbgood: what was the redouble? Transfer?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I always greet Andy Braithwaite as Andrew it always makes him smile|pg||
mb|3H|nt|royhughes: true, but 4@s has a play of sorts|pg||
nt|royhughes: if the trump king was onside|pg||
nt|patricck: slam is only a moderate propostion....as well as the trumps behaving you need to avoid an unlucky club ruff. Today the clubs behave, but the trumps don't|pg||
nt|athene: south will go on now i think|pg||
nt|frankaus: running scores both remi's at - http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=spo&E=1&R=&T=R|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: This is a lot of bidding by West and South, though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that's a world class scoring system Frank|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: if 3@D was only forcing to 3@S, then 4@S shows some extras|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: It looks like Braithwait imagined short spades opposite|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes 4@S would then make perhaps|pg||
nt|royhughes: and Chan imagined longer spades opposite|pg||
nt|davidstern: I hate Chan's bidding his hand twice here|pg||
nt|athene: ok - good view to pass - admittedly north had lots more encouraging bids available, like 4@C|pg||
nt|athene: but even so, you need very little for slam - just give partner @SKQxxx and it can't be that bad|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|royhughes: I don't see bidding 5@s -- Chan doesn't have extra offense beyond his splinter raise|pg||
nt|davidstern: Surely 4@D showed what he had as a passed hand|pg||
nt|royhughes: He could have doubled to show the (slight) extra strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: With seeming two quick tricks and opps vul I would have taken a bite out of 5@D = 500|pg||
nt|royhughes: However, it is easier from here|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: So a swing of 800 on that decision|pg||
nt|royhughes: Haughie leads the king in case he wants to hold the lead|pg||
nt|royhughes: A good lead, I think|pg||
nt|royhughes: He may switch to a club|pg||
nt|royhughes: seeing the heart suit in the dummy|pg||
nt|frankaus: both semi winners will represent aus this year|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|jbgood: all square now after Del'Monte's team bid 7@h on  1!!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good going Richman and Gaspar|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|mariner1: so a quick 5 and out|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|patricck: sounds like partner has wasted cards in diamonds to not co-operate with your splinter, so why would his trumps be as good as @S KQxxx?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|davidstern: I agree it is often good to lead a knowing 'non cost' high card to decide who needs to be on lead|pg||
nt|royhughes: So Braithwait's bold 5@d bid becomes a winner|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|frankaus: Del'monte team would be strongly favioured by the punters|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|d8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|frankaus: they were 49 imps behind an hour or so ago|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|davidstern: Bold..........................|pg||
nt|royhughes: If NS had doubled we would be criticising it more!|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: at Easter NZ held "trials" as only 2 entries Open and Women and 3 Seniors it was a bit of a nothing, winners chose Brazil or Macau others take the other |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|davidstern: Um yes|pg||
pc|h8|nt|royhughes: It is one of the advantages of overbidding|pg||
nt|davidstern: Although East is probably short for his 3@C bid|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: well 1@S is makeable too :)|pg||

mb|2S|an|forced|nt|davidstern: Del'Monte are the top seeds for this event and yes Del'Monte is the NON PLAYING Captain|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: yes, he's way too young to  play|pg||
mb|3C|an|hearts and clubs not 25 bal|nt|davidstern: @SQ for me|pg||
nt|davidstern: Strange lead ina sense as he has the @S9|pg||
nt|royhughes: That would seem like a good idea with the very strong hand on your right|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: slam in 3 suits will they reach one|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 6@c of course if you are desperate for points..|pg||
mb|4C|nt|davidstern: Better idea on this hand anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: Leading low might be the best chance to set up your suit|pg||
nt|davidstern: Buchen were the second seeds and were at times struggling to qualify|pg||
nt|royhughes: but high is safer if the idea is to keep declarer from getting an extra trick|pg||
mb|4D|nt|athene: but this auction looks pretty reasonable|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes however overcalling 1N with kx @D could be a disaster and usually is|pg||
nt|patricck: 1NT overcall was the only possible way i could see that they might get there, but I must say that 1@S looks like a much better bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Which was hard as only 2 teams of 6 were eliminiated|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's exactly 50% so worth it and 100% non @S lead?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: a more fun auction would be 2c 3s p 4s x p 5c ppp|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|royhughes: Haughie plays to build a heart entry|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: didnt get to 6 anyway|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jbgood: I dont think the odds are that good, that caters for the heart finesse only. Then the trump suit and the heart distribution...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|davidstern: @CA and another will freeze South's hand|pg||
nt|royhughes: As David noted, things lie well for declarer|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|patricck: seems like a routine 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: It is tomorrow, in Australia|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mariner1: and even 3 3 @H so not a lot can go totally wrong here|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: at least from here|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: yes, it's tomorrow here too, but i don't think of 1am as being morning, more evening :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: many swinggy hands - makes it interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: another big ew hand|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: well on a heart lead you need a fair amount of luck, but it all works for you|pg||
nt|athene: spade finesse, and not 5 hearts with the @DA|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: 3NT would be a wonderful contract here|pg||
nt|athene: well west can bid 2@S if that's constructive, but east will just bid 4@S over that i guess|pg||
nt|royhughes: But 4@s is almost cold, too|pg||
nt|athene: i agree 3nt has the merit of being exactly 100% sure to make|pg||
mb|2S|nt|patricck: yes, too many values not to bid it, and even though a @H lead is frightening you can't really go wrong|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops I meant 4 4 @H of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: 3@s is probably invitational|pg||
nt|royhughes: Often pairs use the 4th suit on game-going hands|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: yes, although that can get unwieldy|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: don't like 4C|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jbgood: 3 @c should have been forcing, right?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well 5@C is not 3N|pg||
nt|athene: north shows the club fit courteously|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: ys, of course.  A quick look at their card shows me they play 4th suit game-forcing|pg||
nt|athene: if you have to go through 4th suit just to make a forcing jump rebid in your suit (or a forcing raise in partner's second suit) it can get awkward|pg||
nt|athene: i guess it might not be called a "courtesy raise" if it means you get to play it :)|pg||
nt|athene: south decided the hearts were just too likely to be a problem in 3nt, but with basically two balanced hands, this is quite a view to take|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks like a playable spot|pg||
nt|patricck: looks like 3 losers|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he could probe with something clever like 3@D or 3@H over 3@C, expressing doubt about 3nt|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes needs a defensive slip, and that will not be easy to find|pg||
nt|athene: i would have just bid 3nt over 1nt long ago and wandered off in search of food, i must admit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or 3@H|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|royhughes: I don't see much the defenders can do.  If they lead trumps to stop the club ruff, declarer can work on hearts|pg||
nt|jbgood: he should show some club support ..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3N looks the best spot|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: actually there's no reason for declarer to get hearts right|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: south might have doubled 4@C, saving the 12th trick, but no big deal|pg||
nt|frankaus: may be able to limit def to 1@H & 1 @D|pg||
nt|mariner1:  I am with Bill... btw what's for dinner :)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: xxx not great support|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|athene: the spade finesse doesn't help - a pitch from the three-card heart holding|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: although you might actually need the spade finesse to come to 11 tricks - as well as @DAx somewhere of course|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugrapha2: he pulled out the 7D and almost played it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Richman has gone for 1100 on 4 for a ghastly result|pg||
nt|jbgood: would still make 10|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h4|nt|royhughes: Declarer is thinking of ducking|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer just has to set up the hearts whilst dummy has a trump to stop the club cash - or he will think he does|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|patricck: you don't want to take the @S finesse either, you're already hoping that fails so that 3NT in the other room has no chance|pg||
nt|athene: yes, true|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h6|nt|mariner1: only real chance now is Ax @D|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mariner1: and he tries it|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kiwibridge: while this remains close Kanetkar has Stuart on the ropes in the other semi final|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|royhughes: I thought playing hearts was safer than this|pg||

nt|mariner1: what's a "punter" as used there Patrick?|pg||
nt|athene: but it might get more complicated if the 2@H bid is actually a multi-2@D|pg||

nt|athene: to misquote a Marilyn Monroe line:- "those diamonds must be worth their weight in gold!"|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ah ok|pg||
nt|frankaus: "modern" weak 2@H 8-11|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|royhughes: NS's 1NT range must be sort of low|pg||
nt|athene: well they aren't vulnerable, so north takes the low road|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: I like fairly robust 1NT overcalls|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: N: "sorry, I can't count"|pg||
nt|royhughes: Things lie quite well for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well this contract will present few problems|pg||
nt|royhughes: for taking lots of tricks, I mean|pg||
nt|frankaus: multi - = less |pg||

pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: no thats what I thought, a brain explosion :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mariner1: 4@S should make here|pg||
nt|athene: one ruffing finesse coming right up|pg||
nt|patricck: Del'Monte have edged 4 imps closer with two swings of 2 imps each, the margin is now only 10 imps|pg||
nt|patricck: 9.5 imps actually i believe|pg||
nt|athene: north could pretty much plan that during the auction, if east had a sensible sort of suit quality|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: playing for !Q9x or @DJ9x onside|pg||
nt|athene: @DQ9x / @DJ9x|pg||
nt|athene: but with that holding west might insert the honour|pg||
nt|athene: a non-heart lead and there would be more work to do|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it was Andrew Braithwaite who told me last year "there is no such contract as 2NT"|pg||
nt|jbgood: almost home now |pg||
pc|h8|nt|royhughes: It looks a bit strange, though, because declarer isn't likely to want to take a second diamond finesse|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|nt|mariner1: turns out best lead would have been a @S|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|s3|nt|royhughes: plus, as you say, West might insert an honour|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: a singleton trump isn't very appealing though|pg||
nt|mariner1: true|pg||
nt|athene: partners start to get pained after the fourth or fifth time you kill their AJxx, Jxxx, Qxx|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|royhughes: I think the 10 is maybe better, not that it matters a great dea|pg||
nt|royhughes: deal|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|mariner1: 10@C now?|pg||
nt|patricck: if you have pre-empted partner was probably going to get finessed though, so it would be a bit much to say never lead a singleton trump|pg||
pc|d8|nt|frankaus: missed the game ROFL|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: if you need nine tricks, i guess you play diamonds|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: declarer might be disappointed now when he leads to his @CJ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|royhughes: 6 tricks is pretty good for EW|pg||
nt|jbgood: best defense takes it 2 down - not the best defense gives N an uptrick|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: but if you only need 8 you probably don't|pg||
nt|athene: there's a brilliant hand in Michael Courtney's "play cards with tim seres" where Seres switches to an unsupported king like this|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: he wouldnt have thought for so long if he has the q tho|pg||
nt|athene: and declarer assumes his Jxx means only one trick for the defence so doesn't take a fast pitch|pg||

nt|athene: west might still think a while before switching to @CKQxx - he might be worried about the actual club layout|pg||
nt|athene: and be working out if the diamonds are going to be set up for a club pitch|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but he might well switch to a small club from that holding, if he judges the defence need two tricks|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mariner1: NS need to stay low here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|royhughes: right you are|pg||
nt|athene: now west can reopen with some number of something|pg||
nt|royhughes: This time I think there are 9 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: interesting view from north|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N is pretty low|pg||
nt|athene: it looks normal to do something with 5-4 majors, doesn't it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2@C is aggressive|pg||
nt|royhughes: when the club ace shows up in the East, where you don't expect it|pg||
nt|mariner1: N has a perfect garbage stayman hand|pg||
nt|frankaus: once more an exciting hand|pg||
mb|2N|an|23-24 bal|nt|royhughes: aggressive unless it is for play, which is how we used to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north will certainly go to game if south bids 2nt over 2@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: heres the heavy 2C in action again|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: then east will double|pg||
nt|athene: or might double|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if 1nt - 2@C; 2@D - 2@H is constructive, you can't risk stayman, i don't think|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|royhughes: I don't see how they can beat it, do you?|pg||
nt|athene: interesting view from west not to rebid |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but in that case you just transfer|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, can't imagine why you wouldn't, go 2@C then 2@H unless they use that sequence for relay|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: comp. no is 2748|pg||
mb|p|pc|s8|nt|athene: he sure has some playing strength|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: needs a trick from the defence here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there it is!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|royhughes: What would you have bid, diamonds or spades?|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess he decided he isn't winning the auction and he doesn't especially want a diamond, as opposed to spade, lead|pg||
nt|athene: i would be tempted to rebid 2@D|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jbgood: N will have to make a few discards on the @ds|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mariner1: true if not garbage you have to trans to @H or pass|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: probably still just the 8|pg||
nt|frankaus: i back declarer for 9+|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but wait! may still have a @S stop|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: W/S closed the curtain and are discussing N's lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: spades blocked - easy nine|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: curtain open and W is thinking|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: curtain closed again|pg||
nt|jbgood: "curtains"|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: couldnt see what they were discussing|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: and ... open again, more thinking by w|pg||
pc|dA|nt|patricck: if those were my two options i'd still rather transfer to 2@H with a 5-4 hand, even with the terrible heart suit|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: yes, having a bad suit doesn't mean you don't want it to be trumps|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: in fact the worse your suit is, very often, the MORE you want it to be trumps|pg||
pc|dK|nt|royhughes: Difficult decision for West here, although it won't matter|pg||
nt|royhughes: Shifting to diamonds would be good if partner has Q10|pg||
nt|athene: well as soon as he starts thinking, north is happy|pg||
nt|athene: he knows east has the @CA :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, that's right|pg||
nt|royhughes: If partner has Axx in diamonds, though, you want to keep playing spades|pg||
nt|athene: yes you need partner to have something useful like @DAxx @CQxx|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|nt|athene: but a diamond caters for @DA @CQ and @DAQ|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|patricck: bad suit bad hand you want them to be trumps, but bad suit good hand is probably the reverse|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s7|nt|athene: except that if declarer had nine to run and was off the diamond suit, he wouldn't be holding up in spades :)|pg||

nt|frankaus: more excitement here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as expected Richman was in game making|pg||
nt|patricck: The other table who started 2 boards behind have caught up, a situation Andy braithwaite will be used to :)|pg||
mb|2C|mb|3D|nt|patricck: they wouldn't want to lead a spade against 5@C though|pg||
nt|frankaus: some would open N a muid 2@S|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: aggressive double on a ten count facing a passed hand|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: i guess it's OK with perfect shape and two aces|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I hate Bill's weak 2@C game force|pg||
mb|5S|nt|athene: 4@S+2 here, should be both speedy and flat|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes however he is NV vs VUL so jacking the auction up|pg||
mb|6D|nt|frankaus: may lead to a good ? 4@S save|pg||
nt|jbgood: me too, not to mention 5 spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: to me he has a 4@S opener and thats it|pg||
nt|patricck: i don't like it much either, but then again there isn't an action with that hand that I DO like particularly|pg||
nt|jbgood: N might save in 7@d - he will not expect S to have 2 aces for his nonvulnerable jump|pg||
nt|frankaus: more then a few riding on opening lead if the get to 6@S|pg||
nt|frankaus: @CA looks standout tho|pg||
mb|7D|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@S can make|pg||
nt|athene: the 3@C opener might find the @DQ for them - but maybe not, when east shows out on the first trump|pg||
mb|7S|nt|royhughes: Great fitting hands and some luck here -- you could make a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: Yes, you would think so|pg||
nt|mariner1: he has to play K@H in E and can play W for all the rest he needs|pg||
nt|frankaus: back christie to make this|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@S can make, and so might 5@C E?W if they were to get a spade lead, this could be  a very big board|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am "punting" for a make :)|pg||
nt|athene: west's 3NT bid at unfavourable certainly suggests he has the @DQ|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: andrew cues at the 7 level what a man|pg||

mb|1N|nt|athene: now everyone will have lots to say|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: I'm sympathetic -- I like aces and kings|pg||

mb|2C|nt|royhughes: NS have a shot at 4@S -- may be tricky to find the suit|pg||
nt|royhughes: Double must have shown hearts, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: Maybe they play transfers over overcalls|pg||
nt|athene: if you think that 1@D overcalls should be either a good hand or good suit, north could just bid 3nt|pg||
nt|royhughes: Will South pass, or continue with showing spades?|pg||
nt|athene: the traditional meaning of 1@C (1@D) X is 44 majors, but many are rejecting that |pg||

nt|athene: rehi everyone...|pg||

mb|p|nt|royhughes: I think spades plays better than notrump|pg||

nt|royhughes: Yes, I don't blame him for thinking NT should be ok|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: yes coffee hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: west was certainly hitting 3nt - he knows the diamonds aren't going anywhere fast|pg||
nt|athene: it's pretty rare you want to play in 2nt, if you have a 6-card suit|pg||
nt|athene: if the suit runs, you normally make 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: if it doesn't, you probably go down in 2|pg||
nt|athene: but south probably just wanted to pass before the doubling started :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think so|pg||
nt|frankaus: is there any point to 2@C?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes promote a minor suit lead|pg||

nt|athene: hehehe well after all that, north did bid 2@D :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: sorry the room is very dark and they are using written bidding|pg||
nt|royhughes: The joke's on us|pg||
nt|athene: no problem|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mariner1: so BAM we would be looking at opposite results|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: i am glad no-one ever has to rely on MY handwriting to see what i have bid|pg||
nt|royhughes: One argument for 2@d is that partner is quite likely to be short in hearts, and you could lose quite a few trump tricks|pg||
nt|athene: it's hard for partner to raise the "indecipherable squiggle" suit|pg||
nt|royhughes: :)|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps East thought it was forcing? 3NT very pushy facing a NF 3@S bid|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, they would be happy at board-a-match|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|mariner1: this can make now|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|patricck: can and should|pg||
nt|athene: a club lead would have been a lot better|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mariner1: has to win q here|pg||
nt|patricck: it may have been the unbid suit, but i hate leading Jxx|pg||
nt|athene: it was close between a club and a heart, i think, on this auction|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs the 4th @H|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer has four diamonds, @CAK, three hearts|pg||
nt|athene: the defence only have @SAK, @DK, @HK|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he can win A@H and lead one back to Q@H|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: 3@C shows extra values of course...all very reasonable|pg||
nt|royhughes: Chan decides to try 3N, rather than an 11-trick game|pg||
pc|c4|nt|royhughes: Yes, it looks well-judged to me|pg||
nt|royhughes: NS are unlucky that 3rd hand has both spade honours|pg||
nt|royhughes: On any other lie the spade lead would blow a trick|pg||
nt|athene: they are also unlucky that east can win the @CA and put another spade through|pg||
nt|royhughes: Declarer has 8 tricks after playing a club|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: now the defence have 2 spades, @CA, @HA set up|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, you're right|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|frankaus: the lead starting to look formitable even with 36 hands to score|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|patricck: feels like there should be a way for the defence to beat this, but the spades are such that everything doesn't quite seem to work|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d7|nt|patricck: ouch, another 15 to Buchen.....48 imps in 4 boards....and one of them was a push!!!!|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c8|pg||
pc|sA|nt|royhughes: But 5 rounds of diamonds might put West under pressure|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps declarer has to get cute to make this|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: west has stuff in all three non-diamond suits|pg||
nt|frankaus: tho at 15+ at a time it can change quickly|pg||
nt|mariner1: Buchen has a loss coming up though|pg||
nt|athene: i have to say, when people lead short suits against 3nt, trying to find partner, it has a very low success rate|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: leading a long suit which dummy has shown, really doesn't work|pg||
nt|athene: but leading a long suit which declarer has shown 4 in is very often fine|pg||
pc|s6|nt|patricck: leading xx trying to find parter has a better chance than Jxx|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: and is going to get crushed for sure|pg||
nt|royhughes: I guess his best shot may be to play a heart|pg||
nt|athene: well he would have done if declarer rose the @SA there|pg||
nt|athene: to preserve a menace in spades|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: then just run the diamonds and strip-squeeze West|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|sJ|nt|athene: well if you lead xx you need partner to have a pretty good suit and an entry|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: if you lead your own suit you just need partner to have a bit to help there|pg||
pc|c9|nt|frankaus: a bit of ping pong here  - making - going of - making|pg||
pc|s7|nt|patricck: yes, so you would only do it when you have the weaker of the two defending hands and partner didn't really have a chance to oovercall in the auction|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: it was certainly a bit unlucky here that west, rather than north, had the fourth heart|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|royhughes: West is ok now|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: now you lost your throw-in threat so the @CK10 tenace isn't so useful|pg||
nt|jbgood: a trump lead at the other table - then I think it was impossible to win it|pg||
pc|h6|nt|royhughes: right|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|sT|mc|8|nt|royhughes: East's spade lead was the 8, so maybe declarer had a shot at getting it right|pg||
nt|athene: true, but you did need west to have everything - there wasn't really much indication|pg||

nt|snorris: that means 3nt is likly ..if south opens|pg||
nt|mariner1: and we have a violation of Burn's Law again here|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm  - Burn's Laws|pg||
nt|athene: phantom sac against 6@S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a big 9 there|pg||
mb|1C|nt|frankaus: another exciting hand here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 6@S may have been insurance vs 6@H though|pg||
nt|athene: west decided to take the "safe" option in case one of his aces wasn't cashing|pg||
mb|3C|an|5-9 no major|nt|athene: some people might open 1NT with that south hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: certainly will be now |pg||
nt|thegarve:  1NT?|pg||
nt|snorris: must be 1nt|pg||
nt|chick: probably :)|pg||
nt|athene: 5 @C 4@H isn't an ideal shape to open but with 3 spades you can raise the inconvenient 1@S response so you don't have that much of a rebid problem|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Something is wrong here|pg||
nt|chick: Our vugraph operator is Andrea Fischer.   Hi Andrea!!|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps the wrong hand is showing?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are supposed to start with board 31; maybe they didn't|pg||
nt|thegarve:  this was a hand from the last set|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzmc: they have got other cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sure they have|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This hand was played in the previous set|pg||
nt|chick: Roland and Andrea will get it sorted out soon :)|pg||
nt|snorris: what did they play?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Andrea, you must both shut down and load the correct file|pg||
nt|thegarve:  3nT -1|pg||
nt|royhughes: I'm sure some would -- it's pretty popular nowadays|pg||
nt|frankaus: now to make it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 3@C is pushy|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: i would have thought it was top end for a free 2@C - maybe that's a little cautious|pg||
nt|jbgood: same auction - same nine|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: don't think 7@H can have been bid to make, as the auction went - maybe it was|pg||
nt|mariner1: well h'mmmmmmmmmmmmm|pg||
pc|s6|nt|royhughes: No, that makes sense to me, but so long as partner knows what you do, either way is ok|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S = @S+minor?|pg||
nt|frankaus: another huge swing here|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|nt|athene: north assumes his partner has diamonds - the huge double fit isn't disclosed|pg||
nt|mariner1: this swing maybe an 1 imp the 15 level|pg||
nt|patricck: only 14 coming back in....  a mere bagatelle|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jbgood: cannot afford to duck this |pg||
nt|jbgood: a di return would be fatal|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H needs a lot with partner - major-suit finesses are likely to fail, with south having a decent hand|pg||
pc|cK|nt|royhughes: Yes, maybe it was a close decision|pg||
nt|athene: these sort of 2-suited bids are very double-edged swords in my experience|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h2|nt|royhughes: I sympathize with West, though -- he might have had nothing|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: partner opens 2major and the auction accelerates and you really want to know what the minor is but you have to guess|pg||
nt|mariner1: a quartonce and not a quintonce|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s7|nt|royhughes: declarer wonders whether to play a spade or a club|pg||
pc|s9|nt|frankaus: red V green N would expect a better hand IMO|pg||

nt|mariner1: chance for a huge swing here too|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@S biddable and 7 makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: yes, you would be unhappy to reach only 6@S|pg||
nt|frankaus: we have had 14,15,16,17  whats next 13 or 18|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I would be extremely unhappy to reach only 5|pg||
nt|mariner1: octonce|pg||
nt|patricck: i think they have to double 71S to get 18 :)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|mariner1: W has an awfully strong hand for 1N imho|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S from west?|pg||
nt|athene: then east will bid slam surely|pg||
nt|frankaus: chance here 4 pickup|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can this one be bid?|pg||
mb|2D|an|transfer|nt|frankaus: 5@S = OUT slam try works|pg||
nt|patricck: a very good slam, but looks like a tough one to bid|pg||
nt|frankaus: this will help|pg||
mb|d|nt|royhughes: and my co-commentator, William Frisby of England|pg||
nt|mariner1: any slam try works here :)|pg||
nt|athene: diamond raise from North might work to his side's disadvantage|pg||
nt|mariner1: or should|pg||
nt|petergill: Getting easier to bid now after the 2@D transfer|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mariner1: there is a slam try|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, the key feature was that in the other room N/S were bidding hearts, much more worrying for East|pg||
nt|patricck: Braithwaite won't be encouraged to hear about the diamonds sitting over him though|pg||
nt|frankaus: this wont|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: I am Roy Hughes from Canada -- thank you all for watching|pg||
nt|athene: the next segment is coming up in an hour i think?|pg||
nt|royhughes: That sounds right -- I just remember it was too late for me|pg||
nt|athene: 6@S sounds very like a diamond void - west must be tempted|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Klinger leaning back in his chair to tank awhile|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: south falls asleep|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nice when pard transfers to your AKQx|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: it's being suggested that 6@D would sound more like a diamond void|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: This is a borderline slam that goes down with the king of clubs wrong|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL coming??? :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: nope|pg||
nt|athene: but east is a bit short of side aces|pg||
nt|athene: plus he doesn't want to tip off the heart lead|pg||
pc|s8|nt|royhughes: It would be a bad slam to bid, surely, and EW stop in a good spot|pg||
nt|athene: you can't go round bidding slams with NO first-round controls|pg||
nt|petergill: Haughie reasoned that if @CK was missing, on the bidding it would be offside - hence his conservative bidding|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: east put just the 8 down and waited for a disappointed gasp from west before putting down akq and laughing|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|athene: i think 7@S was certainly not impossible to find - although it wasn't easy of course by any means, either|pg||
nt|mariner1: thanks all !|pg||
nt|athene: well done to Klinger|pg||
nt|frankaus: only 17 :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: so a close match again|pg||
nt|athene: it was doubly hard in that there was no way 7@S could induce a phantom save|pg||
nt|athene: which is where a lot of your equity comes from in these situations, very often|pg||
nt|athene: if you are V vs NV and opps have a higher-ranking suit, you might sometimes bid an iffy grand, as opps will take the insurance|pg||
nt|jbgood: even with a worthless @d king slam is on|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: yes, even with the @CK right it would need some work|pg||
nt|royhughes: that's right|pg||
pc|hA|mc|12|nt|frankaus: last tu all 4 ur company  - more excitement - final set  sch in 20 minutes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Haughie Humour|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes,  2@d Dbl 6@h directly was a possible call, planning to pitch spades on clubs. |pg||
nt|jbgood: see you then - bye|pg||
