nt|Walddk2: Ireland made 3NT against NI which is good news for Scotland|pg||
nt|roswolf: north may pass as well as east and then?|pg||
nt|lestergold: south in if he can show the two suiter|pg||
nt|lestergold: ladns on feet with this bid slightly risky at unfavourable|pg||
nt|roswolf: north better not be too aggressive|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Marshall Lewis|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: If they had led & run the knave instead, hmmm|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: The N Irish are in 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: all very sane|pg||
nt|lestergold: north maybe pl;ayed with pard before|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is 2NT conventional?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: No alert|pg||
nt|marlowepi: holding that N hand i wouldnt be that worried about 3NT making while there are 4 losers in 4H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you don;t really have a second spade stop and almost all your stuff is outside spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the hearts are weak but you have great chunky stuff where it will do a lot of good|pg||

nt|ahh: 5@D better contract  but perhaps less successful |pg||
nt|idc: a @c was led other room by South, so defence can only take 3 quicjk ones there - 3NT may have been makeable|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: declarer may be forced to duck a @D now|pg||
nt|ahh: @S lead instantly attacks the entry |pg||
nt|roswolf: a slam is possible here in the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North-South wife and husband, Charlotte and Dennis. Liz may remember Charlotte from Venice 1988 when Denmark defeated Great Britain in the Venice Cup Final|pg||
nt|lestergold: good players know that in 4th seat their pards usually bid their hand for them|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|lestergold: if south had not been a passed hand then north would have made at least a try|pg||
pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: the 2NT bid reaps its very just punishment|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|roswolf: safe enough contract|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Charlotte and Bettina, the very young Danish pair then|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|idc: small @d to the knave could be ducked by SOuth of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: yes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I remember it well - we lost by about 5 imps after I played off a game...|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|ahh: nice defence if she does |pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|ahh: still shouldnt go 4 down so small swing to scots |pg||

pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|ahh:  dec will be pleased 3 down is imps in |pg||
pc|d7|nt|idc: after the @c lead to the knave in other room - if East had led dJ, she has an easy duck if South covers|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I suspect they are well out of 6@C here - can be made, but you need to take good views|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: scientific|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cuttysark: 2 remarkable bids here: the vulnerable double with the disparate majors, and the 1NT with no spade stopper :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: you should not bid grands that depends on a suit breaking 4/3 or even on a 3/2 break according to the conventional wisdom|pg||

nt|vugraphzmq: only when it can be as short as 2|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzmq: who votes for not opening the E hand|pg||
nt|idc: If impressed: if I ever learnt any Danish (beyond Skal), I doubt I would ever get as far as the word for "infrangible" in a million years|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, we dont know what their agreements are. perhaps they distinguish between 3 & 4 card support, and 2NT shopws three|pg||
mb|2S|nt|cindy:  ok  3N  next|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: No 2nt was 3+@s and GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Bif eventually converted me to the idea that 4-4-4-1 is an awful shape for a light opening Stephen|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: Not that bad when the singleton is in diamonds|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well, South has his values in the wrong places opposite a major 2-suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I might find A AK too much but you do have a point|pg||
nt|roswolf: i assume the 29 imps lead is a carry-over!?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: We have no comparisons in this segmwnt yet|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be a very good save|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to get a @D ruff in|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a v good save|pg||
nt|roswolf: depends on whether e/w get their diamond ruff|pg||
nt|mariner1: and that disappears with @S lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: great minds rob!:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: with dim ruff thats only 2 off|pg||
nt|mariner1: 10@D dropping is bug too|pg||
nt|mariner1: big|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe bug is right :)|pg||

nt|mariner1: 5@S|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1444 is the worst|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzmq: what will you miss by passing...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably 2S was artificial|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@s was 4@h|pg||
nt|asig: 6@d is makeable but not easy to bid|pg||
nt|cindy:  well  3N would show 4@h also|pg||
nt|asig: Especially after the 1NT opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@c forced 2@d and then 2@s shows 4@h|pg||
nt|cindy:  ok|pg||
nt|cindy:  gotcha|pg||
nt|marlowepi: TYVM Soren|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West should know North has a singleton diamond|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that was not optimum|pg||
nt|mariner1: well the @c is now as good as the ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: They try to hide declarers hand|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|vugraphzmq: and all the suits breaking badly for the opposition|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So he can pick up South's trump now|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But that does not give him enough tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it is hard to see how the 5th defensive trick arises|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: hej VM|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|mariner1: S wants them to break @D, does not know it does not matter|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: south can dream on|pg||

nt|cuttysark: But I think he has too much to do|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|h5|nt|ahh: i agree with all this about 4441 hands i generally feel they play a king below their point count |pg||
nt|lestergold: it does matter south has the losing option not now|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|lestergold: that west has rushed in|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: It's always an advantage to open the bidding. Defensive bidding is not as accurate|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one advantage of this NS method is that when N and S each have one (different) 4-card major, the opening leader doesnt know whether declarer has the major that dummy ddoesnt have. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it makes the lead harder (and maybe the later defense) compareed to more standard methods|pg||
mc|10|nt|marlowepi: good method for me, because when i open 1NT i usually want to hide my hand also :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6D a playable spot, though|pg||

nt|roswolf: again acion likely |pg||
nt|roswolf: action|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s can make 4s if they guess the spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe N tried too hard to hide his hand. couldnt he bid 3D over 2S? |pg||
mb|1C|nt|roswolf: no since the timing for the trump coup would be ok|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS can handle 4@S if they get there, with careful play|pg||

nt|roswolf: i would bid 2nt here to show 4 trumps ++ max points|pg||
nt|lestergold: north must do something for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n may war oppos about hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: failing that, S might have tried 3D over 2NT. it is not as if the combined values are so thin that 3NT rates to hinge on the lead|pg||
mb|p|an|not 3!s|nt|Walddk2: I like 4@S much better|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: N actully has 17+ so I do also|pg||

nt|ahh: so do i |pg||
nt|idc: Oh, it was a Benjaminised 2@c - even then, North has a little bit to contribute|pg||
nt|henryb: I suspect that N-S play Benjamin, where 2@c shows an Acol 2 bid and 2@d shows a gf|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: yes - they do|pg||
nt|ahh: even the great Albert (alleged inventor of it ) doesnt play it |pg||

nt|lestergold: so all on reading the spade position|pg||
nt|mariner1: interesting K&R show it as 16.5 however DK = 18|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Denmark recently signed the treaty accepting the idea of a slam bonus, so NS were really carrying the "hide declarer's hand" principle too far|pg||

nt|cuttysark: West was playing South for @DA, so I do not fancy his chances of getting it right|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: one diamond for discard not enuf!|pg||
nt|mariner1: you play @S to q|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm slightly suprising line of play|pg||
nt|cuttysark: We have a comparison now - Konow mised the thin 3NT onBoard 1, losing 8 imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: now how will north value this hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I like it - I like aces :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: end up hopefully playing W for Ajx  not easy I admit|pg||
nt|roswolf: how double will give south a problem|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh right only one @D pitch here|pg||
nt|mariner1: so no 6@C|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|nt|ahh: Roland will give exact odds of 1 |pg||

nt|roswolf: interesting 1nt overcall|pg||

nt|roswolf: the raise here may be unwise|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6c for sure being bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: south cant know who is making what here|pg||
nt|mariner1: well does S think N bid 5@C to make?|pg||
mb|r|nt|roswolf: yes he should|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: at this vulnerability he is certainly on a guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would make the samew bis as south|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: ut I would not want to get too high with these breaks!|pg||
nt|lestergold: even tho we can see that double is thewinning bid|pg||

nt|Walddk2: chance of any player having such a holding. The actual chance of any player holding a hand with no card higher than a nine has been mathematically equated to 1,827 to 1|pg||

pc|h7|nt|cuttysark: Worth a thought when there are no overtricks - more tempting if NS were vulnerable|pg||

nt|ahh: the defence |pg||
nt|idc: and the answer is usually: the defenders :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: heart switch?|pg||

nt|cuttysark: I guess you can make 6@S, but unlikely to bid it :)|pg||
nt|paulhac: Hi Liz|pg||
nt|mariner1: N has to know S is short in @c|pg||

nt|marlowepi: or "Constant Comment"|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: but north has a monster opposite an opener|pg||
nt|cindy:  hahaha|pg||
mb|p|pc|s7|nt|idc: hmm, and West can duck the @sQ anyway, so maybe nothing makes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Best to lead a heart against 2NT so opponents realise they may have missed a game :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: so likely to be bid in both rooms for a push|pg||

nt|idc: no, in that case you can use North to reach the dummy|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|paulhac: Its not a gtreat game but vulnerable with 25 points many pairs would have reached it. Even on the heart lead it needs the A@D right|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb: 6N is actually easy. say a minor suot lead. you win, cash the @dKJ and lead the @sQ|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||

nt|ahh: bridge is all around |pg||
nt|ahh: 5@C good spot |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@C is where you want to be here, or even 4@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: this session the score is 19 all|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@S EW?|pg||
nt|lestergold: interesting hand e/w hav e plenty of long suits but its the4/4 spade fit that is i think their best spot for a game |pg||
nt|roswolf: relatively difficult for e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: not easy |pg||
nt|lestergold: the bidding could go pear shaped here very easily|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|mariner1: E bidding a @S here works|pg||
nt|marlowepi: strongly disapprove of the opening lead. the auction makes it clear N has at least nine cards in the majors, and S does not have three entries. just lead a heart and hope.|pg||
nt|cindy:  do you think S more likely to lead a heart if N had bid 3H ?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: especially if east bids 2@C|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H|nt|idc: In other room, Scotland look to be beating 4@s - three rounds of @d to start|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S now?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no, not this particular S. if he didnt lead a heart on this auction from this hand, probably he wouldnt lead one on any auctioin|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S said "sorry pd"|pg||
mb|2S|nt|cindy:  appropriate|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: 2@S is cool|pg||
nt|lestergold: east should bid his 4 card major at first opportunity|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: and they found it|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps a 4@D splinter was not out of placew|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulhac: Interesting X|pg||
nt|cuttysark: South is checking the deck - a lot of good hands about|pg||
nt|cuttysark: A moment for discipline - forget the missed games|pg||
nt|paulhac: Will he be content with 3NT after the last 2 boards|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, it takes a big man to apologize. or maybe just a really bad lead LOL|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: well he was prerpared to risk a reverse but on a ten count with a possible misfit it clould have been dangerous|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S and W was surprised that N had 7|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahh: ROI still +4 v NI   so scotland just leading and no more |pg||
nt|roswolf: but 4nt is interesting|pg||
nt|cindy:  do you think acknowledging a mistake at the table helps the opponents at all ?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: but land on feet|pg||
nt|roswolf: absolutely|pg||
nt|mariner1: some times you have to stick your neck out|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: up with that pesky ace and play trump lose a club and one or two spades|pg||
nt|mariner1: win and run the J@S best here|pg||
nt|cindy:  i know the opps can feed off of a heated discussion at the table|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it does a bit, perhaps, but it does a lot more good for partner than it does for the opps|pg||
pc|d8|nt|idc: South had overcalled @d in other room, this is a tougher lead for North here|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep|pg||
nt|cindy:  thats a good point|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|henryb: 5@c is a MUCH better contract, and I think W should raise clubs over 3@s: partner must have only 2|pg||
nt|ahh: up to 3 imps is a draw |pg||
nt|roswolf: double from someone?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahh: so it cant really be any closer |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|paulhac: Out of the frying pan.....|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This will definitely be a minus score|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They have very few thus far...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ideal is for N to head S apology off at the pass by saying the likes of "I would have made the same lead, pd"|pg||
pc|sA|nt|paulhac: When North passed 2@D south should have backed off|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i do not understand the logic of souths bidding - opposite 2 aces and the club queem he thinks slam is cold - wierd|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|cindy:  ahh|pg||
nt|cindy:  and then giving him hell later ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and then of course N is free to continue the sentence in his own head: "...if i had your brain, that is"|pg||
nt|cindy:  lolol|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|idc: Victor Silverstone in spec has made the same point Henry, quite right too|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H to A and another @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: and make the rest|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry minus a club|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks like a nice hand - but if North habitually opens this tripe you have to be careful|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 making|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahh: i think i am right if both teams finish level then NI win on the tie break|pg||
nt|idc: I have the regulations open, will check but I expect you are right|pg||

pc|h2|nt|golfsquash: 4@h cannot be made against best defence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: THis will seal it for Scotland I think|pg||
nt|ahh: bit of daylight and bluebells for the lassies now |pg||
nt|cindy:  is it automatic to give up on slam with E hand ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I think it is close, but E didn't thnik long|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: well, if you have methods to show various kinds of big raises and W uses this one, maybe|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: not that any more hsould have been bid|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mariner1: well a @S from Q10x is risky here|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a useful rule of thumb when you have a close decision is: if at least 1/3 of your Losing Trick Count is in your trump suit, don;t get too excited|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|roswolf: i think he had a clear cut hand to bid slam and should have tried 5BT = pick a slam - a hand for a bidding challenge?|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|cuttysark: NS have actually gainsed on the board where the defended 5@H undoubled: 3 imps when 6@D was also -1|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|idc: Not that 6@s is a very good contract but w/o a @d lead I expect 12 tricks are there|pg||
nt|ahh: @D lead certainly sinks it  but how to play on a non @D lead ?|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|d3|pc|s5|pg||

nt|mariner1: ty Geoffrey :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: still, N can hardly bid less. unlucky after the opening bid to have 2 heart losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Last board|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: in this segment|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Martin's hand is dificult to handle|pg||
nt|paulhac: Thanks everyone got to go|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Only 10 imps in it - but potential for huge swings on boards 12, 13 & 14|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: She knows she'll get 2@C next|pg||
nt|mariner1: all roads to 3N here it seems|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: No!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That makes life a lot easier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I actually like 2@H very much|pg||
nt|idc: I much prefer the 2@h rebid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Available for a game some day, Ian?|pg||
nt|idc: one day I'll get there ahead of you Roland .. maybe|pg||
nt|idc: Now she has a different problem - how/if to investigate a perfect fitting possible slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  nothing appears to make here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|cuttysark: 6 imps to Konow here - perhaps South has too much defence for the pre-emptive jump|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: Virtually impossible to investigate with any certainty|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H is a practical bid|pg||
nt|ahh: if you need a perfect fit to make assume it will not be there and stay low |pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: next session in 75 minutes|pg||
nt|lestergold: and most if not all roads to 11 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade lead 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: When there is a danger of getting to 5 level down one, I think that's right|pg||
nt|cuttysark: As North does for his pre-emptive opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: spades mullered |pg||
nt|lestergold: ten of cxlubs dropping on round two of the suit guaranteeding 3 club tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: so prediction a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: http://www.bridge.dk/  - Tournament site|pg||
nt|cindy:  guess can make it with club lead and heart guess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tough to lead a spade|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cindy:  now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N will win & flog EW with diamonds|pg||
nt|cindy:  that wont get him 3 heart tricks though|pg||
nt|asig: Right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i didnt say play all of them|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: just 3?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he will play 3 to see what discards are made|pg||

nt|lestergold: in a moment |pg||
nt|mariner1: Mike not suffering from Wiccaphobia this session :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is wiccaphobia?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i fall for it|pg||
nt|mariner1: close as I could get to "curses" :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: curses?|pg||
nt|lestergold: vot yah mean?|pg||
nt|mariner1: fear of Witches and Witchcraft|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah when do i suffer from that?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Fascinating stuff - hope you enjoyed it. Bye all|pg||
pc|d3|nt|asig: heart discard from both?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: whoever shows spade ace, he will play likely the other hand for heart queen. that would mean going down here|pg||
pc|s8|pc|dA|nt|mariner1: as in Commentator's Curse...... you don't I said :)  you have been risking making|pg||
nt|mariner1: predictions|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh |pg||
nt|lestergold: ive made manhy and they ve been right today i think|pg||
