mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: H.C. har den bedste hånd, og så har de allesammen meldt, inden han får en chance|pg||
nt|pelu: her kan ØV være med helt til 4@D - der kun sættes med klør i det blinde|pg||
nt|werge: 4 @D vinder, hvis ikke man finder @c-trumfningen|pg||
nt|frm: Ser ud som om øst-vest klarer den højeste kontrakt. 10 stik i @D|pg||
nt|werge: Vi er enige, Peter...|pg||
nt|werge: Muligheden skabt på en hånd, "som vi ikke alle vilde melde ind på..."|pg||
mb|3S|mb|5D|nt|Walddk2: De vilde ville måske|pg||
nt|frm: Det ser svært ud at serve fra KBxx i @C i det blinde udspil|pg||
nt|werge: sry ville|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Det er straffen for at melde 2@D ind med den hånd|pg||
nt|pelu: indmeldinger i minor viser normalt 6-farve eller stor styrke - derfor ville mange passe i Øst|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Makker tror du har noget|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Men hvis det kan lokke Søren i 5@S, så sidder 5@D jo lige i øjet|pg||
nt|pelu: ved det andet bord passede Øst og Syd købte spillet ved at springe til 3@S|pg||
nt|frm: Jeg ved ikke, om man kalde det "straffen". Lige nu ser de da ud til at kunne tjene et enkelt IMP (mere hvis SC melder)|pg||
nt|werge: Selv 5 @D D giver nok gevinst - 100 mod 140|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: så straffen er : +2 IMP :)|pg||

nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi geoffrey|pg||
nt|lestergold: who knows about biding systemsn in use here |pg||
nt|roswolf: not me:(|pg||
nt|lestergold: ur the second weakest link then|pg||
nt|roswolf: there is a website but i dont have the details|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4h no prob for N/S|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s hand i think 4@H?|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4@S here with bad split|pg||
nt|caitlin: unlikely to be bid|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Welcome all|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mafia13: Good morning. And welcome! :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: But we won't know for sure until the very end when Jim has no fingernails left|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Majors|pg||
nt|ahh: this is a great hand should be throw in but no    every player has a bid |pg||

nt|lestergold: 4s x 800 today|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Ed:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hello Ed :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so the conventional raise are full in all world |pg||
nt|othered1: Ew may get in here, as west has a normal to double of @S, if that's what double means, not just @H|pg||
nt|caitlin: I assume a X by West would show hearts not takeout|pg||
nt|othered1: That's a bad method|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahh: 2nt was lebensohl |pg||
nt|bridge_one: playing 5 major it is important to distinguish between 4 and 3 cards raise|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning all and welcome back to Copenhagen|pg||
nt|mollerjep: Goodmorning everybody|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning Nadia and John|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahh: asking north to bid 3@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 3@H is too high on best defence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But you don't always get that|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Søren Fritzbøger|pg||
nt|mafia13: Hi Roland.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Good morning|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: north not wasting any time|pg||

nt|lestergold: east had better take his violin away quietly|pg||
nt|caitlin: Why a bad method Ed?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|vugraphzpf: hi guys|pg||
nt|lestergold: so no bloodshed and therefore no fun for the specs|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Anders|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi anders|pg||
nt|lestergold: i assume west's double was a  support double|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: well it was a noise:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: if so very dangerous on his pile of fester i know players who would have bid 4s as east|pg||
nt|othered1: because, first, since 2@H doesn't deny @H, when you double you better be able to beat them.  so double will be rare.  And how do you safely make a 3-suit takeout?|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: Can afford to cash @DQ, then the spade switch must come|pg||
nt|idc: I suspect the defence need a spade ruff soon to beat it|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Ireland made 3NT against NI which is good news for Scotland|pg||
nt|roswolf: north may pass as well as east and then?|pg||
nt|lestergold: south in if he can show the two suiter|pg||
nt|lestergold: ladns on feet with this bid slightly risky at unfavourable|pg||
nt|roswolf: north better not be too aggressive|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Marshall Lewis|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Not Bjarnarson, not me:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the pass by North it is a possible choice|pg||
mb|3N|nt|idc: If they had led & run the knave instead, hmmm|pg||
nt|bridge_one: because vuln|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, i dont have strong feelings. if EW were red, then i think pass is better. in trhe actual conditions i have no strong feelings. for a change :)|pg||
nt|mollerjep: yes, in a few sec..|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The N Irish are in 5@D|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: all very sane|pg||
nt|lestergold: north maybe pl;ayed with pard before|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is 2NT conventional?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: No alert|pg||
nt|marlowepi: holding that N hand i wouldnt be that worried about 3NT making while there are 4 losers in 4H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you don;t really have a second spade stop and almost all your stuff is outside spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the hearts are weak but you have great chunky stuff where it will do a lot of good|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: NS are vul, but also N has all working values & excellent spots, and EW are NV so no riches likely on defense|pg||

nt|ahh: 5@D better contract  but perhaps less successful |pg||
nt|idc: a @c was led other room by South, so defence can only take 3 quicjk ones there - 3NT may have been makeable|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: declarer may be forced to duck a @D now|pg||
nt|ahh: @S lead instantly attacks the entry |pg||
nt|roswolf: a slam is possible here in the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North-South wife and husband, Charlotte and Dennis. Liz may remember Charlotte from Venice 1988 when Denmark defeated Great Britain in the Venice Cup Final|pg||
nt|lestergold: good players know that in 4th seat their pards usually bid their hand for them|pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: if south had not been a passed hand then north would have made at least a try|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: the 2NT bid reaps its very just punishment|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: safe enough contract|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Charlotte and Bettina, the very young Danish pair then|pg||
nt|caitlin: I would X with North hand|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|idc: small @d to the knave could be ducked by SOuth of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: yes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I remember it well - we lost by about 5 imps after I played off a game...|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|ahh: nice defence if she does |pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahh: still shouldnt go 4 down so small swing to scots |pg||
nt|idc: not so quickly South... good|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: well done|pg||
nt|idc: well done|pg||
nt|ahh: excellent play by dec and south |pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzpf: making 2?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahh:  dec will be pleased 3 down is imps in |pg||
pc|s4|nt|idc: after the @c lead to the knave in other room - if East had led dJ, she has an easy duck if South covers|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I suspect they are well out of 6@C here - can be made, but you need to take good views|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Anders Sigsgaard|pg||
nt|asig: Hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi Anders|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: on borderline 4333 hands (Pass or Double) it is not unreasonable to make the decision--if nothing else serves as a decider--based on whether or not your 4-card suit is spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: because that makes 2S more likely to make and more likely to push opps to 3 level|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|lestergold: so far the hands have been boring and sane|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk4: and welcome to Cindy Marshall|pg||
nt|cindy:  hi all|pg||
pc|c8|nt|idc: so South must duck and then declarer has a tough choice - running knave and perhaps losing 4 quick clubs is silly if @d were 2-2 all along|pg||
nt|caitlin: makes excellent sense to me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: OK caitlin you've convinced me :)|pg||

pc|c4|nt|roswolf: another low level and safe contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps not on this layout but a grand is very biddable and good odds to make|pg||
nt|lestergold: not good enif odds for a grand excellent odds for a small|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: scientific|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and meanwhile NS had a likely 140 in spades, a virtually certain 110|pg||
nt|bridge_one: all finesses are good, so np for N/S|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cuttysark: 2 remarkable bids here: the vulnerable double with the disparate majors, and the 1NT with no spade stopper :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: you should not bid grands that depends on a suit breaking 4/3 or even on a 3/2 break according to the conventional wisdom|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes science doesnt exist in Denmark it seems|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right, easy slam, three finesses, what's the problem ?  :)|pg||

nt|bridge_one: however always 12 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: many would scoff, but it is not totally crazy for E to double 2C. even the times NS could in theory make you pay dearly, it will in fact happen only a tiny fraction of the time|pg||

mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: Not that bad when the singleton is in diamonds|pg||

nt|cindy:  not for me thx|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I might find A AK too much but you do have a point|pg||

nt|cuttysark: We have no comparisons in this segmwnt yet|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be a very good save|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to get a @D ruff in|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a v good save|pg||
nt|roswolf: depends on whether e/w get their diamond ruff|pg||
nt|mariner1: and that disappears with @S lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: great minds rob!:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: with dim ruff thats only 2 off|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: 2@s was 4@h|pg||
nt|asig: 6@d is makeable but not easy to bid|pg||
nt|cindy:  well  3N would show 4@h also|pg||
nt|asig: Especially after the 1NT opening|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h9|nt|cuttysark: West should know North has a singleton diamond|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that was not optimum|pg||
nt|mariner1: well the @c is now as good as the ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: They try to hide declarers hand|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzmq: and all the suits breaking badly for the opposition|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So he can pick up South's trump now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cuttysark: But that does not give him enough tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it is hard to see how the 5th defensive trick arises|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: hej VM|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bridge_one: 9 @C and 2@C, so one is a false discard ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors if i passed the W hand i would not be that eager to overcall. i don't want E to raise, really, and meanwhile N might have a bad 6-count so declarer might go down ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: several in 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S was thinking in 2 seconds before playing @c2|pg||
nt|cindy:  well at least he has the ace|pg||
nt|bridge_one: perhaps was more easy playing @S instead @C for the declarer|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mariner1: S wants them to break @D, does not know it does not matter|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: south can dream on|pg||

nt|cuttysark: But I think he has too much to do|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|caitlin: I wouldn't open the West hand and he takes chances with the overcall|pg||

nt|roswolf: needs the spade finesse|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c8|pc|s8|nt|bridge_one: 9 in @S by North - nice guess by West|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, i would rather open and get it off my chest than overcall. but pass throughout is fine |pg||
nt|cindy:  looks like he is going minus only 200|pg||
nt|cindy:  100 maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: +110?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South has only 3 @H, so 1 down, not 2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in general i don;t like to open a one-bid on a 5422 10-count when i have 100 honors in a suit other than the one i am bidding :).  in a way i would rather open 1D, but would settle ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for pass|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahh: i agree with all this about 4441 hands i generally feel they play a king below their point count |pg||
nt|lestergold: it does matter south has the losing option not now|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: that west has rushed in|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: It's always an advantage to open the bidding. Defensive bidding is not as accurate|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one advantage of this NS method is that when N and S each have one (different) 4-card major, the opening leader doesnt know whether declarer has the major that dummy ddoesnt have. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it makes the lead harder (and maybe the later defense) compareed to more standard methods|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: good method for me, because when i open 1NT i usually want to hide my hand also :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6D a playable spot, though|pg||

nt|roswolf: or make a t/o double w|pg||
mb|3C|an| |nt|marlowepi: well, we should bear in mind that apparently one of the hands N can have is a strong NT, which lessens the attractivenss of 3S a bit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C may be could be any balanced hand without stop in @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@c was not alerted by S|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: It shows a strong hand because you don't pre-empt against a pre-empt|pg||
nt|ahh: so do i |pg||
nt|idc: Oh, it was a Benjaminised 2@c - even then, North has a little bit to contribute|pg||
nt|henryb: I suspect that N-S play Benjamin, where 2@c shows an Acol 2 bid and 2@d shows a gf|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: yes - they do|pg||
nt|ahh: even the great Albert (alleged inventor of it ) doesnt play it |pg||
nt|idc: EW have done well to limit the likely loss for Scotland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 300, 4 IMPs to CBAI. Next hand Stephen, please|pg||
nt|henryb: is he still around?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: one of the minors will probably be useful...|pg||
nt|ahh: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: This may come down to a diamond guess|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lestergold: west has done quite enuf|pg||
nt|roswolf: now for the play|pg||
nt|lestergold: so all on reading the spade position|pg||
nt|mariner1: interesting K&R show it as 16.5 however DK = 18|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Denmark recently signed the treaty accepting the idea of a slam bonus, so NS were really carrying the "hide declarer's hand" principle too far|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now can arrive at slam (:|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not now, sry|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i thought south would make the cue in @s over 3@h|pg||
nt|marlowepi: superficially looks like a possible misunderstanding, but pairs who play strong club encounter the auction 1C-1S by opp with depressing frequency, so they should know their methods|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the bid i was expecting from S pver 3H was 3NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@H by South it is intelligent - beacause more richt give the minimum of hand that the control in @s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: right()|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if S doesnt bid 3NT, they will never play there, and why shouldnt it be the right contract some of the time?|pg||
nt|jbgood: you asked for action - here you go!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I guess K&R reduce it for AQ @c|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you if club not set up then long dims will take care of club loser|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt was a perfect choice, agree|pg||
mb|3S|an|  |mb|p|nt|marlowepi: his hearts are terrible and his minor suit help might mean 9 tricks in NT with 4H going down|pg||
nt|cindy:  uhoh|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N wants to correct to 4H that is fine also|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i have a feeling that EW will be overcalling a lot in the rest of this match when NS open 1C :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D is a squeeze cuebid - means control in @S (the suit where North don't bid control|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I think 3nt could be unserious/serious|pg||
nt|cindy:  :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt is perfect - 2 stop in @S, no shortness, minimum (otherwise 3@s)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mafia13: seemed like it would have been more fun to dbl NS here...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mollerjep: what about Brøndum? Will he raise the stakes...no!|pg||
nt|jbgood: W tried - but E let NS off the hook|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mariner1: one obstacle down|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht discard of course of no value to declarer|pg||
nt|roswolf: oh well|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N/S discussed board 2. S was not sure aff 4@h in N. That was wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: West think he is declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: still early|pg||
nt|mafia13: well, Kasper is a very nice guy :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: A new leader in the match|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: well|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N might have made 6H, as it would be somewhat attractyive to E to lead a D, playing W for the queen. but S is doomed|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: x was unlimited|pg||
pc|s7|nt|caitlin: that may be why South bid 4@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my opinion, what is "unserious" is playing 3NT as artificial when no more than an 8 card fit has been promised|pg||
nt|bridge_one: too much value in @h for N/S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: It is a (loosing) finesse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E is right to think a long time|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or not :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Club now for an easy set|pg||

pc|sT|nt|cuttysark: Well done - nneded to play @SA other to avoid the endplay|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bridge_one: if South has th 9 in @S no exist chance for East, so A is correct|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|h6|pg||
nt|mollerjep: it's much easier to hook NS if S passes, so full marks to Brøndum for that strange 2h  |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: i think the play of the spade king at trick one conventionalkly signals "partner you bid too much" |pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||

pc|c4|pg||

nt|cuttysark: West was playing South for @DA, so I do not fancy his chances of getting it right|pg||
nt|lestergold: flaw?|pg||
nt|mariner1: after opening lead W was marked with @SA,, so J was issue,,,,, @c to dummy|pg||
nt|mariner1: best line|pg||
nt|roswolf: another freakish hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@C nice spot,,,,,,,, 6@S not so much|pg||
nt|lestergold: not right to play club because that would have given up the possibiklity of the club loser eventually going on diamonmds|pg||
nt|mariner1: remember he knew where @SA was|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6c?|pg||
nt|lestergold: nice?|pg||
nt|lestergold: where does the spade loser go?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: well bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: one point less (K in @d instead Q@H&Q@D) and the slam was made|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: lol, but Askgaard doesn't do that:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N to S: You are born lucky|pg||
mb|1N|nt|henryb: hard to imagine anything but a push on this board|pg||
nt|idc: East has one of my hands, though it's a bit more shapely than I usually get|pg||
nt|ahh: a true yarborough |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: one diamond for discard not enuf!|pg||
nt|mariner1: you play @S to q|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: hmm slightly suprising line of play|pg||
nt|cuttysark: We have a comparison now - Konow mised the thin 3NT onBoard 1, losing 8 imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: now how will north value this hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I like it - I like aces :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: end up hopefully playing W for Ajx  not easy I admit|pg||
nt|roswolf: how double will give south a problem|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh right only one @D pitch here|pg||
nt|mariner1: so no 6@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahh: Roland will give exact odds of 1 |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even better news for Scotland now. NI -5 against Ireland|pg||
nt|roswolf: interesting 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|lestergold: well difficult for n/s now not to over cook the hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: the raise here may be unwise|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6c for sure being bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: south cant know who is making what here|pg||
nt|mariner1: well does S think N bid 5@C to make?|pg||
nt|caitlin: good Namyats hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the problem for North was to guess if AQ@d was 2 tricks or one - after 1@S overcall he choose the chance to find the K in West|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes he should|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: at this vulnerability he is certainly on a guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would make the samew bis as south|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|cuttysark: ut I would not want to get too high with these breaks!|pg||
nt|lestergold: even tho we can see that double is thewinning bid|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: A Yarborough is a hand with no card higher than a nine spot. The term is derived from Lord Yarborough of England, who offered a wager with odds of 1,000 pounds to one against the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: chance of any player having such a holding. The actual chance of any player holding a hand with no card higher than a nine has been mathematically equated to 1,827 to 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like @S may be where they end up + west may have a flyinf hack|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|roswolf: hmmm wet by west|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Worth a thought when there are no overtricks - more tempting if NS were vulnerable|pg||
nt|jbgood: S's response: I find your suit prd|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: 6c is two way its inmsurance again st vul opps makingh 5h and its slam if partner is good|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bridge_one: now @C|pg||
nt|caitlin: I think @H7 signalling for diamond|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East will make the contract only discarding on @D and playing @D from dummy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is a namyats hand in playing strength, yes. the problem with opening 4D is that you need specific stuff in specific places and it will be awkward looking for it at that level, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as there may be no safety at the 5 level. for slam purposes i would rather open 1S. with hearts, though, i would open 4C|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: @cA, @cq and @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: but a club is best|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South is thinking at a hand like  @S@S@S@S@S@S, xxx @D Kx@C inEast|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in this case must play @D|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bridge_one: plauing bridge it is very important to guess :)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S is a practical bid because NS may have a cheap save. also at these colors 4S cannot be chopped liver so you arent really underbidding by much|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: wst had better button it up here|pg||
nt|caitlin: interesting splinter with an Ace|pg||

nt|cuttysark: I guess you can make 6@S, but unlikely to bid it :)|pg||
nt|paulhac: Hi Liz|pg||
nt|mariner1: N has to know S is short in @c|pg||

pc|sA|pg||

nt|mariner1: you know your hand is worth a K or A more, and you have cards in between you|pg||
nt|mariner1: and S,,,,,, time to raise|pg||
nt|bridge_one: giving the control of 3th round in @C (haveing 4 cards raise)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and hoping the @C arn't 3/0 :)|pg||
nt|othered1: got the idea across, and north seemed to rightly value his red controls.  BW does the rest|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East led away from the @HQ twice|pg||
nt|henryb: its more problematic with a stiff K or Q, which may promote tricks and don't show up in Blackwood|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: 4 of his 5 points not working too hard|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: one normally does not like to have stiff ace for a splinter, but here S esily has splinter values even without that ace|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: Good bidding and a good contract|pg||
nt|othered1: I think this was an excellent auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would bid 3@S immediatly because East (after dbl at 2@S) could have cards to bid 4@S and after ii become all more difficult|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahh: which was twice too many |pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 13 tricks|pg||

nt|henryb: its like the newspapers|pg||
nt|mariner1: only part scores here|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very favourable layout and south'shand on thelayout was worth more than his bids had shown in effect|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if playing a weak NT, the case for double is stronger|pg||
nt|henryb: if you are going to cue @s, undoubtedly 4@s would be better than 3, since 3 would, I think, be looking for a stopper for 3N|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|ahh: so far as scotland are concerned run of flat games is all they need |pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably S doubled because he thought a 4-4 heart fit might be the best strain. that might be true at the game level, but at the slam level clubs should be better. and S has slam ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: values. that is why I would bid 4S directly over 2S|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac: They will do well to reach 4@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: still risky though, obviously. the sort of call that would become genuinely attractive if a swing were needed|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, 4@s immediatly better that 3@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome Henry|pg||
nt|caitlin: but North could have 4 hearts |pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Henry:)|pg||
nt|othered1: And doyou think 4@S -- using all t hat room, so it should be a very specific hand -- is better than the approach south took?|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, perhaps, but 4@s does not leave very much room for manoeuvre|pg||
nt|henryb: no; with all those high cards it is unlikely that they can preempt high|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bridge_one: the problem is: 2@C 2@s dbl 4@s ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: bidding is easy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If I open 4@H with that hand, my partner has @SQ, @HK and @DA|pg||
nt|ahh: i like 4@H until p turns up with @H  K and @D AK|pg||
nt|idc: pick the most likely game, bid it, then make it ... next board|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N might have some play from S,,, how to bid that|pg||
nt|mariner1: and N bid NT here 1st anyway|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is E held even the heart TEN he might well just blast 4H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: over 1C|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|paulhac: Not now:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i do thinkl an immediate 4S is better, because NV  W might raise spades|pg||
nt|dburn:  since all partner can do over it is sign off or bid Blackwood|pg||
nt|othered1: The loss of space would make me think twice before bidding it.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 2h the normal spot|pg||
nt|dburn:  at any rate, West has a particularly vile problem in this auction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not me. no problem when you are compensating for loss of space by showing a very specific hand, and leaving RKC available|pg||
mb|2S|an| |nt|henryb: I suppose it is too much to expect that partner's KQ would be in @d and that she might hold the @hK in addition?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: so there are at least 3 hands to make slam easy |pg||
nt|ahh: Ian find a 4th |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 2@H nice and calm|pg||
mb|2N|an|18-20|nt|idc: life hasn't taught you to expect disappointment every time?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He will find the grand slam|pg||

nt|marlowepi: this will quietly go down two probably|pg||
nt|henryb: 3N unusual or to play?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: not a good contract|pg||
nt|dburn:  he may have hoped that 3NT showed the minors|pg||
nt|mollerjep: Konow and Gjaldbæk playing their last season together after winning several championships.|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac: It needed to be played by West to have any chance|pg||
nt|lestergold: on this lead at any rate|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl by North would work in this hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: no alert|pg||
nt|dburn:  on the grounds that two hands tha could not enter the auction at their first turns could not want to play in 3NT, but...|pg||

nt|marlowepi: W is not going to play E for 8 hearts, after all...|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|othered1: I still like south's getting @H into the auction early, which made north's later decision trivial.  |pg||
nt|dburn:  North can't double because West will run, and he can't necessarily handle 4@d|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the specifics are: 4+ trumps, shortness, first or second round copntrol of the 2 "off-suits", and serious slam-try values|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: W: Maybe I am to good|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree totally david, but if 4S is in the menu it is gonna have to show spades|pg||
nt|bridge_one: invit + is better for West - easy call slam |pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: 3@C Puppet   3@D at least one 4-card major   3@H = spades|pg||
nt|idc: no, in that case you can use North to reach the dummy|pg||
pc|c2|nt|paulhac: Its not a gtreat game but vulnerable with 25 points many pairs would have reached it. Even on the heart lead it needs the A@D right|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|henryb: 6N is actually easy. say a minor suot lead. you win, cash the @dKJ and lead the @sQ|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: cant  be beaten with a viking axe|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps a dabish one!? with superhuman powers?|pg||
nt|roswolf: danish|pg||
pc|c7|nt|idc: I've left it till last, but 6@d is ok too but hard to see them getting to that|pg||
pc|c6|nt|paulhac: Good Pyschology Liz:)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahh: how right that advice often turns out |pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2D presumably showed an unidentified major, perhaps in a particular strength-range|pg||
nt|dburn:  West might have just taken a shot at seven (perhaps bidding 5NT first), but his actual view is not unreasonable|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Is 7 good?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|henryb: when S ducks, cash the @sA and the clubs and play @hA and another|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: rehi|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: yes, 2@d was multi.|pg||
nt|dburn:  not bad - not cold, but not bad|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the grand slam it is near to be impossible - only finding sgl in @C or the K in @c - so 6@s is reasonable (5@D would instead to search grand slam)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|d9|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|dburn:  worse on a club lead than any other (unless played by West, of course)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|idc: With the fragile heart position, 6@s could have been better than 6NT, just one of those things|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it doesnt seem to me that W needed to give up on finding a grand. what could go wrong by bidding 6D? if E has club king & the spades we expect he will go on|pg||

nt|ahh: another 4-1 @S break |pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: mildly|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West carefully holds declarer to 11 tricks - hard not to feel bad about that|pg||
nt|roswolf: big fits where will the music stop?|pg||
nt|roswolf: straightforward hand here|pg||
nt|lestergold: not quite a game here for e/w|pg||
nt|dburn:  but even then, you can pitch two clubs on the top hearts and hope to play a complete cross-ruff for thirteen tricks|pg||
nt|dburn:  during which, if @hQ or @cK puts in an early appearance, so much the better|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: You really want to play the hand out in the hope that one defender revokes when you know you are 1 down?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5@D looks good|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: It was good then..|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or if you discover it hidden in your own hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: we had one earlier|pg||

nt|ahh: we also had 13 penalty cards on friday |pg||
nt|ahh: leading just :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: just a thought - not a suggestion|pg||
nt|henryb: the operator had a problem because BBO would not permit a revoke|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 2@C must include a weak 2@D option|pg||
nt|paulhac: North south can make 5@D and it may be difficult for East/Wesr to realise they need to save|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s will be bid and off is my prediciton|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i might take a small piece of that|pg||
nt|lestergold: north only needs to lead Ac and see partners doubleton showing card|pg||
nt|roswolf: north may bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H lead might confuse things|pg||
nt|lestergold: its only a small non vulnerable piece |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: No, It did not show any strength range. Just not a 2suit|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: maybe 5@HX ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a lot to think about|pg||

nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNNG ****  LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  SCOTLAND 91, N-IRELAND 88, ENGLAND 80, IRELAND  72, CBAI 71, WALES 44 ****|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: very much so:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht lead wrong when  you have an ak that partner is never going to expect if you dont lead it|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c cash is the play though...... to see dummy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D is sufficient - if East hold control in @C he would bid over 5@s, otherwise would bid 5@s, after 6@S by West and finish the bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: agree, 2@d looks better|pg||
nt|cuttysark: -300 is not a big deal against -400|pg||
nt|paulhac: Rather too strong for a weak 2@D in my book|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Of course the defenders may not find their spade ruff...|pg||
nt|roswolf: AGREE|pg||
nt|henryb: or when they do not lead a trump and you find partner with 4(+) @d|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, you are going on to 6S whatever E does, so i think W should just jump straight to 6D over 4S, to let E know immediate;ly how close to a grand they are|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahh: full of all the coffeehousing tricks known to man |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not mine either but when she does, South has no problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: no error here|pg||
mb|2N|an|18-20|nt|Walddk2: What is this 3@C all about?|pg||
nt|ahh: forcing |pg||
nt|ahh: in this tournament @S break badly i am not bidding them |pg||
nt|idc: to find a 4-4 @s fit, but then I'll bet she worried that 3@s wouldn't be forcing (it should be) |pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: i have a 4c major and a @C stop and a good hand|pg||
nt|idc: 3@s after the 3@c 3@d continuation I mean|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Nort has worked out what partner has - and now very difficult to save|pg||
nt|paulhac: Cannot critice East's X|pg||
nt|roswolf: that double will cost|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well, the 4@H maybe suggests a lack of defence there, and what else do you have?|pg||
nt|roswolf: west mightsave the day|pg||
nt|paulhac: If West knew that south had opened a weak 2@D hhe would not have bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: to see partners card|pg||
nt|lestergold: no doubt uidca|pg||
nt|dburn:  it wasn't easy, though. There are matches where you'd win 13 IMPs just for being in six, though obviously this high-class affair is not one of them.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after all, the 4S call gives W about a one-loser hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: W and S is discussing board 10|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well done|pg||
nt|mafia13: catching partner with another boring dummy|pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: no double? no trouble|pg||
nt|paulhac: Great result for E/W|pg||
nt|paulhac: That will be 2 on the trot will N/S be reeling?|pg||
nt|cindy:  would you dbl second time with E hand or 3N ?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt is 16+ bal ? |pg||
nt|marlowepi: and i don;t think it is clear at all that E would bid 6C over 5D every time he has club king. what if his spades are ATxxxx and he has no shape? and maybe E thinks the point of 5D ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: was especially to fetch a much more convenient HEART cuebid?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ok, seen - 15/17|pg||
nt|othered1: brb|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahh: this has better chances than 4@S|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Ups|pg||

pc|s3|nt|lestergold: goodbye vienna|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: 4S might easily be on on 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: will guess heart now|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|cindy:  should guess it|pg||
nt|cindy:  now she knows N has diamond ace should be easy to guess   and also S might have led a heart with Qx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also prefer 3H to 2H by N on first round, by a lot|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: slam doomed. if W opens a strong NT at other table, the final contract might well be 6C making|pg||
nt|henryb: this one should be less successful|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: well 2nt was 14+ and UK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @D lead beat|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: and off as someone predicted :)|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|idc: so the effect of the negative double was to prevent them finding their 4-4 fit, with all the room in the world|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not a great hand for NS's method|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: perhaps easier to guess, but not by that much since S is a passed hand and N has a lot of leeway. it's the non-heart lead that will drive the guess, and that does not depend on the ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: D ace|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes i agree  |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|idc: bidding is contrary sometimes :)|pg||

nt|mafia13: Well, we are still waiting for those really big boards...|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|mariner1: E bidding a @S here works|pg||
nt|marlowepi: strongly disapprove of the opening lead. the auction makes it clear N has at least nine cards in the majors, and S does not have three entries. just lead a heart and hope.|pg||
nt|cindy:  do you think S more likely to lead a heart if N had bid 3H ?|pg||
nt|mafia13: Schou is still picking up imps along the way though...|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: especially if east bids 2@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: In other room, Scotland look to be beating 4@s - three rounds of @d to start|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S now?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no, not this particular S. if he didnt lead a heart on this auction from this hand, probably he wouldnt lead one on any auctioin|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S said "sorry pd"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3NT a rather lucky make here|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  3NT show a hand that would like to preempt, but has a good suit and perhaps a little extra and thus is afraid to bypass 3NT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cindy:  appropriate|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S: Semigood preemt|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Wise decision by South not to bid 4@S as it would have been quite expensive this time|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: 2@S is cool|pg||
nt|lestergold: east should bid his 4 card major at first opportunity|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mariner1: and they found it|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps a 4@D splinter was not out of placew|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulhac: Interesting X|pg||
nt|cuttysark: South is checking the deck - a lot of good hands about|pg||
nt|cuttysark: A moment for discipline - forget the missed games|pg||
nt|paulhac: Will he be content with 3NT after the last 2 boards|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, it takes a big man to apologize. or maybe just a really bad lead LOL|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: well he was prerpared to risk a reverse but on a ten count with a possible misfit it clould have been dangerous|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: S and W was surprised that N had 7|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahh: ROI still +4 v NI   so scotland just leading and no more |pg||
nt|roswolf: but 4nt is interesting|pg||
nt|cindy:  do you think acknowledging a mistake at the table helps the opponents at all ?|pg||
nt|henryb: 1@sX sort of gruesome, as is anything else|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: but land on feet|pg||
nt|roswolf: absolutely|pg||
nt|mariner1: some times you have to stick your neck out|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: up with that pesky ace and play trump lose a club and one or two spades|pg||
nt|mariner1: win and run the J@S best here|pg||
nt|cindy:  i know the opps can feed off of a heated discussion at the table|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it does a bit, perhaps, but it does a lot more good for partner than it does for the opps|pg||
pc|c2|nt|idc: South had overcalled @d in other room, this is a tougher lead for North here|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep|pg||
nt|cindy:  thats a good point|pg||
pc|c9|nt|henryb: 5@c is a MUCH better contract, and I think W should raise clubs over 3@s: partner must have only 2|pg||
nt|ahh: up to 3 imps is a draw |pg||
nt|roswolf: double from someone?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure why E ran before getting doubled in 1NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now means 3/3 red|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|ahh: so it cant really be any closer |pg||
pc|c3|nt|paulhac: Out of the frying pan.....|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This will definitely be a minus score|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They have very few thus far...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ideal is for N to head S apology off at the pass by saying the likes of "I would have made the same lead, pd"|pg||
pc|c7|nt|paulhac: When North passed 2@D south should have backed off|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i do not understand the logic of souths bidding - opposite 2 aces and the club queem he thinks slam is cold - wierd|pg||
pc|h8|pc|cT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cindy:  ahh|pg||
nt|cindy:  and then giving him hell later ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and then of course N is free to continue the sentence in his own head: "...if i had your brain, that is"|pg||
nt|cindy:  lolol|pg||
nt|bridge_one: nice bid by East - immediatly 2@c don't work|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bridge_one: rbl and after 2@c give the information to have 4 cards in other suit|pg||

pc|c4|nt|ahh: considering the pressure |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: S will not duck twice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he cant bid 3S over 3C, because then too easy to miss cold 3NT when E has no semi-stop|pg||

nt|marlowepi: yes, weak 2s on 7-card suits make me ill, though many top players would disagree|pg||

nt|marlowepi: after D finesse, draw trumps and exit spade to rectify count. W cannot lead a club & E is squeezed|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: West has @h K|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think no, bec must play @D from dummy one time, and after need 2 entry to ruff a @h, so i think impossible to make ... but i can be in error|pg||

nt|marlowepi: yes that is also true when you open 1NT in first chair, when you know nothing about the hand. here you know RHO is weak|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 31 and 32 first before comparisons from the closed room when we roll over to board 17|pg||
nt|ahh: sure |pg||
nt|ahh: hi all |pg||
nt|cindy:  hmm|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North would make only with a big mistake by East - if East play A in @H after he win the first @H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6NT best|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 162-104|pg||
nt|robinswr: when i won the queen of clubs, he could have ruffed a heart and then put west in with a spade who would have to lead a spade or a diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: hover ruffing a @H, playing @s, North would make the contract, bec leave the K in @H at West, so can entry in the dummy ruffing  a @s |pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Jim Hay|pg||
nt|idc: This might be a quiet game, or just possibly a more exciting slam hand|pg||
nt|ahh: not sure by the end i will have any fingernails left |pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: My sympathies are with the non-playing captains|pg||
mb|2D|nt|idc: I'd adise them to hit the bar now - one of them will find it helps to get a start|pg||
nt|paulhac: I like Wests action|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Doesn't do to be overawed just because 1NT calls itself 'strong'|pg||
nt|roswolf: will north double to show the suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why was that good? cold on normal S king lead|pg||
nt|cindy:  4S for me now|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Redbl presumably suggests playing in the other suit, assuming it is not clubs|pg||
nt|paulhac: I wonder if they have discussed the follow up sequences after a xx|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has done enough?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Now it is E/W|pg||

mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: i don;t waste my time dreaming about dummies, i dream about the real thing :)|pg||
nt|asig: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: NS have actually gainsed on the board where the defended 5@H undoubled: 3 imps when 6@D was also -1|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|idc: Not that 6@s is a very good contract but w/o a @d lead I expect 12 tricks are there|pg||
nt|ahh: @D lead certainly sinks it  but how to play on a non @D lead ?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: good bid, good slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 5nt = no Q|pg||

pc|hT|nt|cuttysark: 6 imps to Konow here - perhaps South has too much defence for the pre-emptive jump|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
