nt|ahh: 5@D better contract  but perhaps less successful |pg||
nt|idc: a @c was led other room by South, so defence can only take 3 quicjk ones there - 3NT may have been makeable|pg||
nt|vugraphzmq: declarer may be forced to duck a @D now|pg||
nt|ahh: @S lead instantly attacks the entry |pg||
nt|roswolf: a slam is possible here in the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North-South wife and husband, Charlotte and Dennis. Liz may remember Charlotte from Venice 1988 when Denmark defeated Great Britain in the Venice Cup Final|pg||
nt|lestergold: good players know that in 4th seat their pards usually bid their hand for them|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: if south had not been a passed hand then north would have made at least a try|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|roswolf: safe enough contract|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Charlotte and Bettina, the very young Danish pair then|pg||
pc|c8|nt|idc: small @d to the knave could be ducked by SOuth of course|pg||

pc|h9|nt|idc: after the @c lead to the knave in other room - if East had led dJ, she has an easy duck if South covers|pg||

mb|p|mb|5S!|an|2+q|nt|idc: hmm, and West can duck the @sQ anyway, so maybe nothing makes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Best to lead a heart against 2NT so opponents realise they may have missed a game :)|pg||

nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|6H|nt|Walddk2: 3@C Puppet   3@D at least one 4-card major   3@H = spades|pg||
nt|idc: no, in that case you can use North to reach the dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac: Its not a gtreat game but vulnerable with 25 points many pairs would have reached it. Even on the heart lead it needs the A@D right|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: 6N is actually easy. say a minor suot lead. you win, cash the @dKJ and lead the @sQ|pg||

mb|1H|nt|mariner1: 4@S EW?|pg||
nt|lestergold: interesting hand e/w hav e plenty of long suits but its the4/4 spade fit that is i think their best spot for a game |pg||
nt|roswolf: relatively difficult for e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: not easy |pg||
nt|lestergold: the bidding could go pear shaped here very easily|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|mariner1: E bidding a @S here works|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: especially if east bids 2@C|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|idc: In other room, Scotland look to be beating 4@s - three rounds of @d to start|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S now?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@S is cool|pg||
nt|lestergold: east should bid his 4 card major at first opportunity|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mariner1: and they found it|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps a 4@D splinter was not out of placew|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|paulhac: Interesting X|pg||
nt|cuttysark: South is checking the deck - a lot of good hands about|pg||
nt|cuttysark: A moment for discipline - forget the missed games|pg||
nt|paulhac: Will he be content with 3NT after the last 2 boards|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well he was prerpared to risk a reverse but on a ten count with a possible misfit it clould have been dangerous|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: ROI still +4 v NI   so scotland just leading and no more |pg||
nt|roswolf: but 4nt is interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but land on feet|pg||
nt|roswolf: absolutely|pg||
nt|mariner1: some times you have to stick your neck out|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: up with that pesky ace and play trump lose a club and one or two spades|pg||

pc|cA|nt|idc: South had overcalled @d in other room, this is a tougher lead for North here|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep|pg||
pc|c3|nt|henryb: 5@c is a MUCH better contract, and I think W should raise clubs over 3@s: partner must have only 2|pg||
nt|ahh: up to 3 imps is a draw |pg||
nt|roswolf: double from someone?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahh: so it cant really be any closer |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|paulhac: Out of the frying pan.....|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This will definitely be a minus score|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They have very few thus far...|pg||
pc|s5|nt|paulhac: When North passed 2@D south should have backed off|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i do not understand the logic of souths bidding - opposite 2 aces and the club queem he thinks slam is cold - wierd|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|cuttysark: NS have actually gainsed on the board where the defended 5@H undoubled: 3 imps when 6@D was also -1|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
nt|idc: Not that 6@s is a very good contract but w/o a @d lead I expect 12 tricks are there|pg||
nt|ahh: @D lead certainly sinks it  but how to play on a non @D lead ?|pg||

nt|paulhac: Thanks everyone got to go|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Only 10 imps in it - but potential for huge swings on boards 12, 13 & 14|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: She knows she'll get 2@C next|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Available for a game some day, Ian?|pg||
nt|idc: one day I'll get there ahead of you Roland .. maybe|pg||
nt|idc: Now she has a different problem - how/if to investigate a perfect fitting possible slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|cuttysark: 6 imps to Konow here - perhaps South has too much defence for the pre-emptive jump|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Virtually impossible to investigate with any certainty|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H is a practical bid|pg||
