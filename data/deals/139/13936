nt|mr murray: TYhe almighty couldnt beat this one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: is is a usefull convention|pg||
nt|caitlin: dicey X as West is so strongly 2 suited and N-S may be equally strong in other 2 suits|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q@c and @S vs K hoping don't find @S 5/0 ...|pg||
nt|caitlin: as is the case with clubs ..........this lead will not see a ruff as East may show @DA to no avail|pg||

nt|jeanhari: 1NT by south? would be my choice..|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|jeanhari: maybe rather obvious |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|xenya: a similar 1N opening occured on Bd 7|pg||
nt|desert: he has to guess Clubs to make this contract....|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|jeanhari: declarer must guess clubs to have a chance to make this|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|jeanhari: indeed, but not sure even then|pg||
nt|jeanhari: diamonds overruff will be the problem|pg||
nt|xenya: i think there is more to it than just guessing clubs -- looks like he also needs to set up a @D trick -- can be done but tough|pg||

nt|bridge_one: seam E/W play stand carding|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|caitlin: regardless the lead from doubleton would be high low|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: so 1@C isn't american style (otherwise would open 1@d) - and 1@D open is 4+cards but unbalanced|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes with 2 clubs East played high low|pg||
nt|caitlin: short club?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: E/W UDCA , small encourage, inverted count, stnd leads|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bridge_one: here not the best hand for South ...|pg||
nt|caitlin: any runnout by South not good|pg||
nt|bridge_one: any expert pair have conventions to escape in this situation|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  S decided to open with bare @h king - now transfer from partner isn't the best S wish to get|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bridge_one: 2@D 5cards|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  although, 6-card suit lookes well now|pg||
nt|dimi: yes 2@h is a good contract|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|bridge_one: e/w don't use negative dbl (otherwise East would Dbl with 2/3 cards in @D)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|h3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be West must dbl 2@h leading @h - he know opps are playing with 7 cards |pg||
pc|c4|nt|bridge_one: sry, not negative Dbl, but inverted Dbl (comment at 2@d)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|bridge_one: i think West would Dbl 2@H|pg||
nt|caitlin: but he didnt know that yet:))|pg||
nt|caitlin: they should X 2N if they doubling 1N|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 5@h South don't passed 2@d (except with 3@d)|pg||
nt|caitlin: surely with West opening and East's hand is full opener.......|pg||
nt|caitlin: oh sorrrrrrrryyyyyyyyyyy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: it is better to play trump in long suit of weaker player|pg||

mb|1N|nt|xenya: with the same result i think -- for example, E could cash the @C Q and play another -- to W's 8 of trumps|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|desert: hmm i dont like the last Pass by West.....but he is vulnerable, so there is a good excuse...|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: the Dbl at 4@S (previous hand) very expensive : 12 IMP !|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The 14 imps came in on board 1, here 5@S dbl was made whereas in the Open the opps were left peacefully in 4@H making|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: of course 1@h xfert (that is a very good conv.)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  after negative dbl from E, N doesn't introduce his 4-card @h, seemingly |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|caitlin: and a convention being used more and more frequently by experts and more advanced players|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  that's a good example of both side reasonable bidding|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3@S in this sequence has to show shortness - and by implication support for the other 3 suits - and competitive values|pg||
mb|5D|nt|bridge_one: note 1@s instead 2@s (american style use 2@s preemptive weak 6cards)|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  should admit, EW found good defence|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The NS no trump range is apparently 15-17, - a "good" 14 is also allowed, so S's game bid was a bit unlucky not to succeed|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  without @c shift, declarer will park his @c loser on @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: frequently there are a lot of line to play|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 1@D unbalanced 4+cards|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: here a situation where it is usefull to have good gadget to reopen|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|dimi: now 11 tricks for NS in the majors available|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 1Nt is stand with a bal or semibalanced hand 12/14 +-1hcp|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@d is cud (i suppose) not xfert|pg||
nt|bridge_one: cue|pg||
nt|bridge_one: sry - 2@d was by East !!!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the Dbl by South same means - takeout|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: dbl by North (instead 1Nt) would means weaker hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|dimi: same tricks in 3nt |pg||
nt|vugraphzkj: if opps lead trumps he declarer will get problems with his @Cs|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|dT|pg||
nt|dimi: now all tricks|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Martin, I think it takes trump leads from NS at every opportunity to stop 4@S|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|bridge_one: many kibitz ask about Dbl at 2@d - isn't usefull to use Dbl to penalize opps when they bid free - so right to use Dbl takeout|pg||
nt|caitlin: it is still takeout|pg||
nt|caitlin: rarely will one see a X at low level which is penalty|pg||
nt|vugraphzkj: So this board looks like a draw. Thank you all for being here with us. See you tomorrow for the next round!|pg||

nt|yuval10: if X was penalty|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: who of your accounts do u like to be most?|pg||
nt|xenya: the somewhat off-shape 1N is acceptable here , with the singleton being a King  |pg||
nt|yuval10: many ways to treat W's hand...some will open 1@c and rebid 2@c, some opens 1@d and rebid 2@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1NT is acceptable as long as P doesn't have 5 @s's and force you to play it with 5-1 fit|pg||

nt|bridge_one: but need @H lead to beat|pg||
pc|c3|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|caitlin: he needed to duck|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  one more @h lead and ruff with @h 10 promotes trump trick for defence|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|nt|bridge_one: declarer is searching to make the IV @s to discard a @D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: at 3Nt lead @H - declarer duck - after @H again, duck again - now A@h and @H - E/W will make A in @C and one @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 5 tricks|pg||
nt|caitlin: safest card is high club|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @c 10, sorry|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c5|pg||

pc|c8|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|nt|caitlin: still loses diamond and spade|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however 3@C was made - so 2 down is -2 IMP (difficult only 1 down) |pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: J in @S don't need here|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Only 2 non-flat boards, 5 flat - a quiet set |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|bridge_one: 6@H down with 2 counterplay - otherwise difficult to find the same|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|bridge_one: 5@c 2 down was  a good defence|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East is playing to beat 4@H (at 6 he would ruff) |pg||
nt|caitlin: by not ruffing he may also give away where the @HK. But he still has to play West for singleton Queen|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes Ellen|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mcarroll: this should be at least one down, 5@H and 2 Aces|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S wil probably get 2@S, 3@C and 1 @D|pg||
nt|mcarroll: will|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next door, EW went down in @h partscore after E 1@d third-hand opening|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h6|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|bridge_one: don't ruff tell at declarer @h 3/1 or 4/0|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is also good example why you and pd need to know whether you lead A from AK or K frok AK:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: normally all people use a clear way when lead fron the suit where made preemptive|pg||
nt|caitlin: I am an Acer from AK unless at five level where King asks for count|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sfoxa:  as for me, 11 points balanced isn't opening worth|pg||

pc|s5|nt|caitlin: yes nice line by declarer so far|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South is playing seeing all cards , of course|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes the preempt give enormous information to declarer|pg||
