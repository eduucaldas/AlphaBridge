nt|Walddk2: Our first comparison|pg||
nt|jcmax: Muller at the other table opened 1@C and reopened with a double over S's 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are on board 5 in the CR, so we will likely get comparisons on the remaining boards|pg||
nt|ritong: zia might try 2NT|pg||
mb|2D|mb|3N|nt|libraamc: ok now|pg||
nt|ritong: or more according to start|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|jcmax: That was well done in my view. Many times when you double with a hand like E's partner bids on hands that you don't really want him to bid|pg||
nt|mr murray: he wont like the dummy |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Two segments of 16 boards tonight, three segments of 16 tomorrow, and three segments of 20 Saturday|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For full vugraph schedule, please go to http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  and bookmark it!|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d6|pc|s9|pg||
nt|ritong: the first trick will give him a good picture of the hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in a general way, the E hand would prefer to be dummy in NT. but holding those diamonds E knows W will never bid NT so he makes trhe practical call|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|jcmax: Still at this table NS were always better placed than at the other table. There never was a danger of S bidding 3@S!|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|jcmax: So EW basically had no chance to go plus|pg||
pc|c4|nt|warrens:  tempting to stick in the 8, hoping for a later endplay of N|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|warrens:  but the club situation kills him|pg||
nt|ritong: NS are not children, by far, however opening 2@d with 5 cards and a void is not really plausible|pg||
nt|ritong: so the @d 8 will stand for sure|pg||
nt|warrens:  agreed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/2usolq5  for the tournament website with line-ups and convention cards. Dutch as well as English|pg||
nt|xenya: N would have done better to insert the @D9 -- admittedly he was not sure about E's holding in @Ds|pg||
nt|jcmax: I would consider this board a system win. The Italians at the other table couldn't open 2@D because they don't play weak-twos.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||

nt|mr murray: zero spades is always scary :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|jcmax: Then maybe most Americans would win the board. :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Many pairs not playing weak 2 play a weak 2 in @D in their 2@C opening, I think|pg||
nt|mr murray: They have to win some boards. Lately they are falling behind their European and Asian brothers and sisters :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|jcmax: Some players not playing a weak-two in 1D may considr 3@D instead.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jcmax: But surely that is not Fantoni-Nunes style|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: Zia's double showed the unbid suits, but in that situation you normally have tolerance for partner's suit too. Often a doubleton, but can be three|pg||

nt|kit: North will have to shift to a diamond, not a club, for maximum effect.  Far from obvious.|pg||
nt|jcmax: 3@H is not likely to make. Probably declarer can hold his losses to down 1. whatever minor the opponents attack will give a trick for a discard in the other minor|pg||

pc|c9|nt|marlowepi: N has to win|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kit: even with spades 2-2 and ace of diamonds on, declarer has only 6 spade tricks and 1 diamond trick outside of clubs|pg||

nt|Vugraphzgp: Hallo Sabine :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: down 2 on trump lead i think, and not hard to find|pg||
nt|jcmax: hoi Bas :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Diamond switch will actually take it 2 down|pg||
nt|jcmax: Have I already missed any of the excitement?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, Zia's 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|mr murray: kibbitzers say down 2 with good def. they are right if he shifts to diamond jack|pg||
nt|ritong: first board is like a streetfight, S|pg||
nt|mr murray: easier said than done :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, a real surprise attack, that overcall. who would ever suspect this E of a phony 1N at these colours? :)|pg||
nt|ritong: how so, phony|pg||
nt|marlowepi: facing a passed pd|pg||
nt|mr murray: easy for us in the privileged seats|pg||

nt|hedyg: but the next 1 is starting soon|pg||
nt|lestergold: Well you have 7 world class players and one quite good player in this match but good is not world class|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps the failure to raise spades can be explained that Fantoni cannot have 10HCP for not opening 2S|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcmax: As to what henri? the level? :)|pg||
nt|ritong: zia is vulnerable, for starters|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Zia: "Can you please tell my fans it'll be a long weekend, I'm getting older!"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They'll get to 6@S easily enough I predict|pg||

nt|ritong: maybe more, R|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|mr murray: great grand. but not going to be easy to bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The only question is if they will bid 7|pg||
nt|xenya: what about 7@S?|pg||
nt|jcmax: Wouldn't you want to be in 7 though?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I sure would|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even decent play for 8 if you need a swaing|pg||
nt|jcmax: I guess Zia prepared his fans for his 1@H overcall. At a younger age he might have done someting different :)|pg||
nt|mr murray: this is the time one of Zias loud preempts would work better. lots of room now to bid the grand|pg||
mb|2D!|an|6!S, strong|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Thanks for explanation, Bas|pg||
nt|ritong: drijver will like this 2@d|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 6 spades, strong hand|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|ritong: @s are established now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Not sure what 4@C was...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: It sounds like a splinter, but we can all see it sin't...|pg||
nt|ritong: kind of cue for @ss, prolly denying a @h splinter|pg||
mb|5D!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@C can be 18-20 balanced|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: I've heard "control" "Aces" "Blackwood" and "Gerber" so far :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/netherlands/brink-drijver.pdf|pg||
nt|xenya: likely some sort of asking bid, yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: though a pre-empt would have been more effective in this instance, Zia's quiet overcall followed a very sound tactical principle that is too often ignored -- once partner has ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: passed it is typically better not to advertise weakness when you are in fact weak....it just convinces the opponents they can make something at a high level|pg||
mb|5H!|mb|p|nt|jcmax: The problem for S is that he most likely doesn't know about N's long @D-suit. so he may be trying to find out whether N has 3rd round @C-control|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: also, when you do catch a fit & partner can bid, opps always know they are in a forcing pass situation, which is great for them. |pg||
nt|jcmax: Without 3rd round @C-control the grand only makes because of N's long @D-suit|pg||
mb|7S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: ooole|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well done|pg||
nt|warrens:  wow|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mr murray: Good point Marshall but there is "some" merit in taking 2 levels of bidding away from opponents|pg||
nt|ritong: not a complete claimer, tho|pg||
nt|mr murray: I think it is a claimer|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|warrens:  needs 4-3 @d's or doubleton Q or a club-diamond squeeze|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|mr murray: its there|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also true, Murray, though that advantages accrues much more with spades than when your suit is hearts and you are short in spades|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not a claimer.- Diamonds could be 5-2|pg||
nt|mr murray: absolutely|pg||
nt|jcmax: Declarer will no doubt play to ruff the @D good. If that fails there still is a chance the same hand has 5@D + 4+@C or QJ in @C|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the squeeze based on length is very unlikely i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And 5-card @d must not hold @cQJ or 4(+) @c  as Michael Rosenberg points out|pg||
nt|mr murray: they sure could be 5-2 but he wont play for that unless he has 2|pg||
nt|jcmax: He is careful to preserve his trump entries in dummywhich he needs to try for both chances|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Sabine before him :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: who is it that could hold that? W clearly has a few hearts, likely 4, and he will show up with 2 spades|pg||
