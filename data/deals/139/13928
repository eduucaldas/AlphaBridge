nt|capercliff: something to be said, if you have the hand that wants to force to the 4-level, but what about the 3-level raises?|pg||

nt|flash: those watching on BBO-TV will start with the Other Table Results button|pg||
nt|capercliff: interesting choice to pass with the W cards, most would bid 3@d without thinking|pg||
nt|capercliff: but pass is absolutley the right bid|pg||
nt|flash: the West hand seems closer to a 3@D opener than a 1@D call, but at these colors, there's too much outside|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|capercliff: modern bridge, if partner had a wee bit more they would be playing 3N -2|pg||

mb|2S|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|flash: 3NT not a bad speculation, given the scoring table; but the whole thing isn't to my taste|pg||

mb|p|nt|april7: Now EW will end up in 4@Smaking 5|pg||
nt|icearif:  easy 4H or 4S here|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|april7: W could bid 2@C Drury instead of 3@S|pg||
mb|3D|nt|h_karluk: to be fair 4@d at 1st seat perhaps kind of "outstanding account" in universal trade when both vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: might be a misunderstanding about the 3@S bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it must be a good problem to try 3@s by NS|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: N's decision to bid 4@S on the last board is not easy to understand|pg||
nt|yuval10: N must've think that his P has a singel @h to begin with|pg||
nt|vugraphzkj: "always bid 4@S over 4@H"...:P|pg||
nt|xenya: even so...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: agreed, as you know, when you hold a freak there's often no right or wrong bid|pg||

nt|caitlin: to pull to 2@H a safe place|pg||

pc|dA|nt|ybob: 600 is too high to NS in 5@C, but win 4@S if W no play @C never|pg||

pc|dT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the good thing there were fast arrival so noone gone to bid again|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: so even a partscore may determine the winner on such matches, now Izmir BBS a tad advantageous side|pg||

nt|h_karluk: we are grateful to German Bridge Federation, organizators,BBO, our excellent operator Martin, Vladimir and Per Olaf Sundelin|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room, E opened 3@C third in hand, which probably accounts for the final contract |pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ybob: because 3@H + 5@D + 1 K black |pg||
nt|ybob: wd|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I m told by a Turkish International expert plays same sysytem that @c 16+ any. @h 5+@h 8+pts|pg||
nt|xenya: but the modest 2@C overcall here may have the same effect|pg||

nt|h_karluk: some pairs prefer to use 1@d as xfer to @h|pg||
nt|xenya: i think it is hard for declarer to picture this kind of hand with E|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am also told that 1 @H as gf deny stiff and very unbal, could be 5422. and so in|pg||
nt|xenya: from his perspective, E is likely to have fewer clubs but maybe the @H K|pg||
nt|xenya: he can be fairly certain, i think, E has one of the major-suit kings|pg||
