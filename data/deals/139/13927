mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|lml: yes probably the right play in retrospect|pg||

nt|jaapfr: are EW female students:)?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Also part of the explanation why when it's not clear who owns the hand or who can make what, the 5 level belongs to the opponents.|pg||
nt|lestergold: why do i call you Frank it should be Rodal its psychological sorry|pg||
nt|jaheim: strange 6 sp with only K8xx in @S|pg||

nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: A hard one from W but I belive Erik will bid. But will they reach 4?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jaheim: another @S contract,  better trumph this time  :)|pg||
nt|stoffers: instead of 2nt eliassen could have bid 4@h maybe?'|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: Or a auto stop at 2@H?|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h should make |pg||
nt|rodal f: Looks as Ekrens 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: it is |pg||
nt|jaheim: but 9 tricks max|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - 8 to be exact - both ways|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: A rarity - a weak 2@D opener|pg||
nt|sharkey: the previous board was down 2 - not 1 - will be corrected|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to find A@c and Q@c lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: good vuln save|pg||
nt|andyv:  down at least 500|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx Torstein:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes they may stretch too far on this one too|pg||
nt|djneill: how many @s now, shirley?|pg||
nt|djneill: 2@s, 3@s seem the options|pg||
nt|stoffers: vulnerable thats a big 2@s i think...but when finding partner with a 6 card fit...no problem|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rodal f: This contract is playable by a dobble hook in @C|pg||
nt|hagz: 3 NT makes, 6 @c makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: looks reasonable - unless the 4-1 @H break becomes a problem|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here is a good example of a hand that natural bidders should open 1@D.|pg||
nt|larsarthur: south is not sure about @dfit|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Marshall Lewis|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hi all :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Must be prepared for all continuations -- here, 1@D and then 3@C and you feel much better than this.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@c seems a better contract ironically|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  now it's serious:)|pg||
nt|larsarthur: lowest 4-card is std in Norway|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Marshalll.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A spec asked why Harstad havn't been at BBO. They try to do there best and match 7 are not putted up. They told.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hagz: Hard to guess @s in 3 NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Just one thing left to do! Bid the 6er....|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually isnt 3n a trick short on a heart lead?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sharkey: A @D lead appears to be best for defence|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S had only 4 losers imo|pg||
nt|jcwla: Interesting to know but that doesn't begin and end the conversation for me in terms of how best to describe this hand.|pg||

nt|rodal f: Wander what's gona happen in OR at this? |pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: there are arguments on both sides, but you aren;lt getting full value for money out of sputnik if you follow the same sequence with this S hand and also on   xx  AKx   xx  Axxxxx|pg||
nt|james_h: tricky rebid in normal systems for south, no such difficulty here 1@s must be 5?|pg||
nt|rv: 1@s possibly shows 5@s here|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi folks!|pg||
nt|geot: Hi friends:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 1 spade was not forcing|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Andres, wlc|pg||
nt|james_h: Hi Geo|pg||
nt|djneill: 3@s shows an unbalanced hand typically, but occasionally 4522 - East has a sharp hand, so at IMPs the idea is to just bid game and hope to make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice name to have going into competition |pg||
nt|djneill: yep|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|andyv:  on @s lead, can N still hold it down to only 4 losers?|pg||
nt|andyv:  without dbl dummying the @c suit?|pg||
nt|james_h: Hi Anders|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rodal f: If any want to look at the pairs systemcards u find them here: http://www.nmlag.com/Systemkort til the turney is fin|pg||
nt|jcwla: When the clubs are significantly stronger or you will be able to handle all continuations, I have no problem with 1@C.  Here, a rebid problem such as this was reasonably likely.|pg||
nt|hagz: yeah, there is only one entrance the the dummy to get the @s tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This might have - regarding the bidding - about 7Â½ % chance to make|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: i suppose 2d sgowing i assume 4 spades might pick them|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant be done really |pg||
nt|hagz: Can't get them|pg||

nt|geot: sure. We have all been there:)|pg||
nt|andersk: lets see if Hjelmeland can male this|pg||
nt|andersk: make|pg||
nt|rv: declarer needs to take @s finesse, if he plays @s from top, 4-1 break might scuttle the contract|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sharkey: Not many use weak 2@D opener - I believe it sometimes is very effective|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway -500 not too bad for NS:)|pg||
nt|djneill: there is a general rule that against 3-suiters, you want to lead trumps - it is just a rule that works - and West has a semi-3suited hand, so South's trump switch was reasonable|pg||

mb|4H|nt|andyv:  ok, I'm blind... where did the @d loser go?|pg||
nt|djneill: other room starting with the end of the set: brds 15 and 16, so we will get results in a few minutes for brd 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S hand a reasonable opening at these colors|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will they try a new hard one NS?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nope.|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie e/w has more play for 4@s than n/s has for 4@h in spite of the hcp distribution in n/s favour|pg||
nt|lestergold: north passing i assume a strong nt holding a 9 count??|pg||

nt|jaapfr: -200 or even -300 to punish W for his 2nt bd|pg||
nt|andyv:  I like when I raise my partner's suit and he/she finds another suit to lead.|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all sorry I am late |pg||
nt|andyv:  never to late, Shirley:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi Shirley|pg||
nt|rodal f: No minisplinter on for NS it seems, but then S would have signed off anyway.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: no - sunny Stavanger :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect if D were Kxx and clubs KQxx, he would have been more likely to open|pg||
nt|djneill: ok @h lead which gives up the suit, but if South ducks, there goes the entry to the @c, so South should rise with the @hA|pg||
nt|djneill: @c behave, so 10 tops - 6@c, 2@h, 1@s, 1@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: can not get greedy on this hand |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|larsarthur: probably|pg||
nt|anton72: Hi ... thx ...just was wondered who was explained 2 NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Brb 3-4 min|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  too:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i dislike 2nt bid W|pg||
nt|andyv:  because of 3rd seat opener, S was not tempted to dbl opps into game|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree with u Mike. A invit would have been normal.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|rodal f: OK. So nice weather there two:) Welcome back home.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  I don't mind it... W is a passed hand and can expect a bit better @c suit than pd put down|pg||
nt|jcwla: Pass seems normal on the actual hand, though reasonable intermediates and medium spots make it look not totally watered-down.|pg||
nt|andersk: still 4 matches to go, and a long way to go, so medal is still possible if we improve!|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I second that; I have been in that position too often for comfort|pg||
pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: once again it may be systemic, but i am not keen on the sequence chosen by E here. Even facing a PH, this E hand has significant game potential in a suit, so i would want to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maximize our opportunities to show suits|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 20 HCP and 4 card support for pard, e will be disappointed there is no Grand slam|pg||
nt|james_h: I do sometimes do in the last segment of the Bermuda Bowl when 16+ behind|pg||
nt|rv: @C lead and @d switch required to beat this which is double dummy defebse|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzkn: V, but there also seems to be a wrong explenation so we will see.|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|sharkey: been here a while now - only leave during cold season...|pg||
nt|jaheim: Flått is prob thinking about the Q of @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: They picked up the cards wrong so Flått opened in 1 heart. All bids alerted after 1 heart.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s what I doÂ´nt like with 2 NT - how many @H has West - you never know|pg||
nt|rv: normal @d lead should result in 10 tricks|pg||
nt|andersk: When all 5 players have been under pari, it is not easy. The easy part is that we cant blame any but ouhrselves:)|pg||
nt|djneill: yes, only way for more than 10 is if opponents pitch hearts and spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or Christer?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rv: Anders, are the top Norwegian pairs like Helgemo-Helness, Grotheim-Tundal, Brogeland-pd playing this event?|pg||
nt|andersk: No|pg||
nt|andersk: They are not qualyfied (Im not sure if they played from start)|pg||
nt|james_h: and Geo has gone south for the Spring|pg||
nt|geot: :)|pg||
nt|andersk: This event is played like 6 rounds of knockout matches, then 8 teams meet for a final long weekend|pg||
nt|james_h: and NZ dollars :)|pg||
nt|geot: he he|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rv: ok, still presume quality of bridge on display is quite high|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
nt|rodal f: LOL:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and pray clubs behave|pg||

pc|dA|nt|lestergold: well he has picked the hearts well|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  question really is if E should leave the 2N bid in|pg||
nt|jaapfr: good question imo:)|pg||

nt|vugraphzkn: N diddent see pds 1nt opening|pg||
nt|andersk: top 8 club teams, this year:)|pg||
nt|stoffers: was out getting food, question was?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I think e/w will try 4 @S here at the end of the day |pg||
nt|jaapfr: still   Studentenes sounds very female to me but do not master Norwegian|pg||
nt|andyv:  S took a far more aggressive stance on board 1 and found the excellent save of 5@d for 9 imp gain|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR|pg||
nt|rv: so quality of bridge on display should definitely be of high standard|pg||
nt|djneill: that @h suit was an example of keeping the final contract in sight, and not mechanically play the suit by itself |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: On Board 1 Studentenes have picked up 11 IMPs - not 10.  6@S at this table was off 2.  This will be corrected|pg||
nt|rodal f: By his 9HP Forfot ain't fare away for a normalopening.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sharkey: Shud be some action here?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sharkey: 3@C some kind of mixed raise?|pg||
nt|jcwla: N must be thinking it's a pinochle deck.|pg||
nt|rodal f: So by the screens N are same blind I am witout screens?:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah that explains |pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: funny faces in here :-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: So far NS have not been able to introduce their @D suit - may be too late now|pg||
nt|sybarra: or will E venture 3 nt at some point |pg||
nt|andyv:  actually N deserves the credit for dbling 4@s|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|rodal f: At board 2 OR are on there way for 6@S. 4@H splinter at W so fare|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: West opens a feather light vulnerable 1@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Rekstad originally played for another Topbridge team but lost to Vikersund in the 3d knockout match. He is hungry for revenge.|pg||
nt|stoffers:  i use it, some dont. I'm quitting it soon, going over to invitational bids directly instead 1@s-3@h invitational and @h :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: we also have another team event plaing like a premier leuage, two 2. divisjons 8 3. divisjons etc, premier leuage is the top team event, this is the top club team event|pg||
nt|rv: do EW play standard or a limited system?|pg||
nt|james_h: Any kibs have outline system info?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 5-5-4-2 with transfers after 1cl openings|pg||
nt|djneill: unsupported Queen and Jack are dubious|pg||
nt|anton72: trum lead beat it|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: south cannot make anything at the 3 level|pg||
nt|sybarra: but its a good hand! |pg||
nt|rodal f: 6@S came at board 2 OR. So a swing it magistern.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharkey: Kib informs 3@C asks for strength and suit quality|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6!@S probably down 1 although 5@S likely to be +1|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: 3 NT shows max|pg||
nt|rodal f: U have the funniest any way Torstein:) I will come to Ålesund tomorrow non. Will be nice to see u again.|pg||
nt|djneill: you like the long @d suit shirley?  looks nice|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6/4 with spades |pg||
nt|mcarroll: not quite a Roland 19-21 and it looks like the 19 count wins|pg||
nt|djneill: welcome martin|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphzkn: NS precision club|pg||
nt|andersk: normally there are 5-8 very good teams in this team final, some years the level is not abselout top|pg||
nt|geot: The nightmare for Førde seems to continue. The 4@S North went down in here (board 18) was played in 4@H at the other table, won by Cantona Nybo. 13 impsmore|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Dan, Shirley|pg||
nt|djneill: ok so another entry-related hand|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|stoffers: no 3@c in passoutseat?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: so wise of NS to stay out of the bidding as appears 5@D x wud be off 800|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jaapfr: good leading technique|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rv: par contract is 5@d for EW though 4@s makes as well|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like PA is trying to play 4@S |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|geot: In 5@D you have to guess the trumps|pg||
nt|james_h: another reason to take the normal line|pg||
nt|djneill: pretty much no way to get to the @d so East must duck a @d, even if South covers|pg||
nt|stoffers: -1 now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would u have done at vul?|pg||
nt|stoffers: indeed..knowing opps have a 9 card fit, they will probabyly fight once more|pg||
nt|stoffers: and vul its 670, nv only 470|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive Allars will thing a bit more at safetyplay after the @HA. Hum|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Allard picks up a card in every suit in his hand. Not sure which route to take.|pg||
nt|rodal f: What would X from N be after 3@C. But hard to come with it if for pan..|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  W's 5@s bid asked for what?|pg||
nt|andyv:  club control or trump?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @S support i say|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi:) Normaly trumh cuality.|pg||
nt|andyv:  if so, then 6@s was optomistic by E|pg||
nt|rodal f: quality*|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even wrong bid E|pg||
nt|rv: how many brds per round, we seem to have started off with a huge score in favor or Namsos BK?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: as he does|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcwla: Will we get a failing @H finesse?|pg||
nt|geot: 16 boards|pg||
nt|andersk: 16 a round  32 a match|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: apparently systemic to open 1H on the W hand|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|larsarthur: how can it fail?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharkey: i predict 10 tricks - probably wrong again....|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jaapfr: better claim down 1 to make dummy not too ashamed:)|pg||
nt|rv: East will pass and West will bid 5@d to deny first round control|pg||
pc|s8|nt|geot: So easy for us, seeing all cards.....to play the trumps without a loser. Not that easy at the table|pg||
nt|james_h: indeed|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|rv: if cue bid is doubled by opps, redouble shows first round control, bidding another suit shows cue in that suit and promises second round control of suit|pg||
nt|djneill: so South must think - is there a possible layout that gives us 3 more tricks outside of @d immediately|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: if the EW carding is to be believed, the heart queen is with E|pg||
nt|andersk: might get the @D right now, since N doubled 5@C|pg||
nt|rodal f: b|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same contract at OR|pg||
nt|rodal f: And same lead. OR|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: Mildly said. E is Erlend Skjetne fro the Norwegian Junior team older.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @S seemed a bit much in the first place|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
nt|djneill: maybe pd has the @sT|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|s7|pg||

nt|djneill: oof|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sharkey: The students picked up another 6 IMPs on bd 2 when 3@D failed in OR|pg||
nt|rodal f: At board 2 EW went surpricing -1 at 3@D and 6IMP for the Students from Trondheim.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E would not respond 1S on a balanced 4-count vulnerab;le|pg||

mb|d|an|alert|nt|sharkey: EAfter East's 4@S west will not move towards slam; perhaps a little "heavy" non-vul|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Which major du you lead?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will a invit come from S and if... will take it? 3NT seems on|pg||
nt|rodal f: will N take it*|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Many use sidecolor at jacoby in Norway.|pg||

nt|jaheim: wrong again  |pg||
nt|stoffers: 3 or 4@d?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  must be showing a major minor here|pg||

nt|h_karluk: or X like Ozdil and Compton play in NY, M+m|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Away from KT-fourth a long term losing lead to NT, @S could have worked but this time @D was the winner.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Stop the E/W wagon, I want to get off|pg||
nt|rv: once partner doesn't super-accept your transfer, you would tend to pass with 8 hcp and invite only with 9 on 5332 or 5422 shape|pg||
nt|james_h: 4s easier in practice|pg||
nt|andersk: Førde again trying to get back by bidding too much|pg||
nt|stoffers: that 2@h bid deserves a huuuuge penalty..|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@D now show some cards. If not lebensol 2NT as order for E to bid 3@C and 31D tell minimum hand at W|pg||
nt|stoffers: vulnerable, passed partner...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jaheim: my guess i mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Can still do it.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Back in a flash.|pg||
nt|stoffers: its different to show cards and have 100 honours in an unbid suit frank, i bid 4@d|pg||
nt|rodal f: A @H lead will come from N. But at 6@D it need to be the K for @C swich|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Eliassen finally alerts the bid and then alerts his head after:)|pg||
nt|stoffers: how can N lead a@h? :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|djneill: lol, I try not to say anything when I put my dummy down - it tends to distract partner :-)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|andyv:  and would still end up in 2@s:)|pg||
nt|larsarthur: well done!|pg||
nt|andersk: abselout supermax in North, still no chanse to make a game, can it be right?|pg||
nt|anton72: too many things are well placed .... they have only 23 hcp|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: Style and deal I belive, but after the bids from W it seems correct. Or?|pg||
mb|6D|nt|rv: this is not the way to get back, you only slide further more often that:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|larsarthur: :(|pg||
nt|james_h: I tend to go with all 9 hcp except flat with no 10's and 9's|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: You as many others would have done I belive. It's only a @C lead that keep them of 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|djneill: knowing the split - any singleton with East leaves 4 @d losers, North is not unhappy to let West ruff|pg||
nt|djneill: when West passes a 2-level takeout, it shows a stack|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ure right. Normal for many to take the @HK, but not for all.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I see more of an advantage for DONT in direct seat... in pass out seat, something simpler might be better|pg||
nt|stoffers: how Rekstad can find his 4@h and 5@c bid i really dont understand|pg||
pc|c6|nt|stoffers: partner has bid 3@d..he didnt act over 2@h,...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Eliassen shakes his head and mumbles to himself.|pg||
nt|stoffers: he cant be that good, and i would say he's got a strong maximum for his bidding so far|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|sybarra: I often play a system in direct seat and natural in pass out seat (or landy only) |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|james_h: North is going through more mental anguish|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: Even with @C lead I believe slam makes as @D set up|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: At balancing. Not direct he said. Thx:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: north's 2 points are working very haARD INDEED|pg||
nt|djneill: ok in other room brd 2, same contract and defense, but East embarked on a total crossruff that was unlucky when North was short in @c - one trick short|pg||
nt|djneill: East had not tested the @h early, so did not know about that split|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: If I were in the NS position, its time to revert to A game and try to salvage pride and practise mental toughness|pg||
nt|james_h: no more swing manouevers|pg||
nt|rv: there are multiple issues with this strategy, a) you invariably lose whatever little chance you have of recovery b) you upset the field by donating IMPs and VPs to opps c) you will ...|pg||
nt|rv: lose your pride|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N should have led Q of diamonds, or at least the ten|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a view a punt hard to bid it accurately|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not to much info to find at there CC after 2@C opening: http://www.nmlag.com/var/fckeditor/nmlag/file/2010/Singsas/Systemkort%20Kare%20og%20Jan%20Emil.pdf|pg||
nt|lestergold: yje stiff hert is an obvious value to N but how can he know how imprtant the Q@c is?|pg||
nt|djneill: ok a 3crd @h raise - it is fine but takes a little judgement or gadgetry to then show that - I think requiring 4 cards is a reasonable agreement|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharkey: S is being pragmatic opening the 5 card @S suit - this in order he'll be able to show both suits|pg||
nt|stoffers: 3nt was very nice, but diamonds dont behave, but in 4@h they do after this lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still Allard got it as he wanted, but don't know yet:)|pg||
nt|stoffers: best is to duck it around ofcource, then he will have trouble getting to thm later|pg||

pc|h2|nt|stoffers: drifting a couple off now is my guess|pg||

nt|rv: playing 2/1 style, most play 3@d as Invite and GF via 4th suit (2@h)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  2N usually an invite since you have 2@c and 3@c to show a variety of @s raises|pg||
nt|djneill: after 2 trumps, West knows there is no pt to playing a third and will get the @s ruff|pg||
nt|rodal f: As 3NT OR might also do. So a push?|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  BUT: @D - and @S to the 10 (50-50) = SEVEN tricks|pg||

pc|dA|nt|rodal f: So too hard for u two Roland?:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wonder why not Andy. U have 2@C as the other posibillity for foring. What else could 2NT be? |pg||
nt|rodal f: Agreements:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  how about a balanced 12-13 hcp hand?|pg||
nt|andyv:  partner did overcall and you want to invite|pg||

pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|djneill: ok now West will make 5 on a black squeeze if North cashes a @d now|pg||

nt|sharkey: As expected Grand picked up IMPs on Bd 3 where EW let 3@H make|pg||
nt|rodal f: But all up to how strong the 2@D bid can be. It often use to be wide in Norway.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i dont think there is any harm in sp[lintering ion the way f u are prepared to jumop to 4 level in any case|pg||
nt|djneill: South must guard @s and @c|pg||
nt|djneill: and it plays like a double squeeze since the @d9 is a threat against North|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the second @D will kill S |pg||
pc|h8|nt|anton72: A @c .... ruff @d with J 2 trumps ...ruff @c ... we are in home|pg||
pc|h5|nt|djneill: it's good of West to do this on purpose, right, for our entertainment?  ruffing @s would be so basic (is there a serious way that would go down?)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: W has a choice oer 1S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Best idea is to claim - |pg||

nt|sharkey: Slam on a finesse|pg||
nt|rodal f: But will get 2 aces away by 4NT.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: useful for NS to play transfers in this situation|pg||
nt|sybarra: may hear screeching of brakes at both tables |pg||
nt|djneill: true, 3-4 support is more encouraging than 3crd after a checkback sequence|pg||

nt|andersk: unbalanced GF|pg||
nt|james_h: 3?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  W not elated with the dbl|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The defence to the Multi Two Diamonds is fundamentally different from the defence to a weak two for a number of reasons: |pg||
nt|andyv:  2N leb?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then can raise to 2S in two different ways, distinguishing pure obstruction from some genuine values|pg||
nt|djneill: some might open South's hand 2@c based on the large number of tricks, right?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes I think the S hand should use whatever forcing opening they use, I would open 2@C|pg||
nt|djneill: 2@c being a strong ART bid, for any poles|pg||
nt|anton72: nice spot ...120|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Simonsen needed a small break after the last one to reboot so we start again.|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: The direct defender always gets two opportunities to bid. |pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: A new gain for Vikersund|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  looks like it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The 4th seat defender usually gets two opportunities to bid.|pg||
nt|andersk: Maybe they dont play 2 NT as unbalanced GF|pg||
nt|rv: anyone for transfers on 1m-1n?|pg||
nt|james_h: I prefer 2n to 2@h|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sharkey: Our excellent operator, Torstein Hesseberg, informs me the club is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year - also followed by a big tournement this fall|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not shure there|pg||
nt|larsarthur: 1 or 2 imp back to vikersund|pg||
nt|djneill: North, having passed, has 4 card support, a working @hQ, and a side doubleton - yeah I think 5@d is an underbid :-)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|h_karluk: The defence do not know opener's hand type immediately. |pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems so now. When 3@H came|pg||
nt|andyv:  looking for 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 2 nt 3 cl 3h should be alerted|pg||
nt|h_karluk: So does that make defending against the multi 2? easier or more difficult than against a weak two? In my opinion there's no problem  as long as you are sensible about it. ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Basically, assume that the 2D opener has a weak 2H/S hand. |pg||
nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx Torstein:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: :-)|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would expect most to double.  Meanwhile, this seems somewhat meek.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: There are numerous variations of the multi 2D, so let's assume a fairly basic one (weak major; strong minor or strong balanced). The suggested defence does not really change if ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there are other possibilities such as 4441 distributions  assume a weak opener. |pg||
nt|andyv:  like all systems...after a while a decent defense or multiple defenses are found and then we wait for the newest development.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: this is my laste Geir will now join |pg||
nt|lestergold: well both n/s stretching their values here |pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: bye all see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|rv: if Ringseth's had a stiff major, he could have jumped to 3M to show stiff and long @DS|pg||
nt|rv: unfortunately 3@c on 1@d-1n shows both minors and 18+hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: I hate  2 @c on unbalanced,  (tough to describe) hard to catch up |pg||
nt|rodal f: Was hard for W to lead a smal @H. Impossible I will say.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: ht lead looks likely and no play|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rodal f: Seems as OR misplayed this board. They lost two tricks in @S + 3@Hs|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|h_karluk: 4th seat  Assuming RHO bids a weak 2d |pg||
nt|andyv:  nice acution|pg||
nt|jaheim: and a coffeebreak|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|andyv:  auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: bye Torstien|pg||
pc|s9|nt|h_karluk: Now things are different, LHO and RHO are both weak|pg||
nt|sybarra: that 9 of @S in dummy is a big card |pg||
nt|james_h: another find the lady hand|pg||
nt|rv: in any case it is best to play some science, either transfers or artificial 2n response as suggested by Anders|pg||
pc|s6|nt|h_karluk: you can freely bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: as is the club holding |pg||
nt|andyv:  but will be difficult to find Q@d unless following the Crane rule:)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: and crane rule is?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well done Torstein and welcome to Geir as the new vug operator. See u tomorrow.|pg||
nt|lestergold: both final bids were overbids in my book|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was it?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  Q was under the J in the minor and over the J in the major|pg||
nt|andyv:  and don't ask me why that works... seemed to have worked for him:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharkey: The venue of this championship is Ålesund - a scenic town of about 60,000 inhabitants on the west coast of Norway.  |pg||
nt|jcwla: 5@D on a finesse failing in the other room and down 2.|pg||
nt|andersk: might get the @D right now|pg||

pc|c3|nt|sharkey: This year they have a GOOD football team as well....|pg||
nt|jcwla: They just went up with @DA actually.|pg||

nt|rv: South did well not to open his mouth:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: So they said the people watching OR here.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|rodal f: S are pressed for a @S hook and 1@S 2@H loosers.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|andyv:  that will help declarer|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rv: wd|pg||
nt|andersk: red card:)|pg||
nt|andersk: @H 4|pg||
nt|djneill: well 1@h certainly worked out here, but had East passed it would not have - the idea is that a void ensures you will not play it at the 1-level|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: a lot depends on how bad N can be for for 2S and--especially--whether NS have multiple ways to raise to 2S. if they do and N has already shown dreck, then he could be turned on by ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the 3H bid...although with 11 losers and bad trumps it is still hard to bid 4S. if they dont have 2 ways to raise to 2S, N can hardly bid a game even though he has heart values|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@S by 10HP and 10X by often 6@Ss in S seems OK at me.|pg||
nt|rv: in case Flatt is just dropping off:)|pg||
nt|andersk: yep:)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: [erhaps the 3@s invite was the more optimistic of the two bids|pg||

nt|rodal f: As Mike said.          The bid from W was 5@H over 3@H.|pg||

nt|djneill: important to inquire about agreements, at least above the club level (then it just helps them )|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcwla: That's not happening -- at least not as a result of forcing NT.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, non-forcing NT would be a lovely idea if 1NT meant "I have a nice balanced minimum responding hand."|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  undertrick time|pg||
nt|jcwla: Unfortunately, much of the time it means "I have some shapely hand that doesn't have enough strength to bid at the 2 level."|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: yes it is fairly normal to bid 2S despite the poor holding and the good clubs--my point is that playing forcing NT really S has no idea of which black suit will be best|pg||
nt|rodal f: It's exslution blackwood. HOW many aces do u have pard exsept in @H|pg||
pc|h4|nt|djneill: South pitched a low @c, probably encouragement|pg||

mb|2C|nt|h_karluk: I guess opening 1N when you've 5 cards good or bad M suit is just a gross distortion, you don't know the others. simplest example, you can save yr life starting with 1@H/@s and ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: suddenly yr lefty bids 1N(15-17) and yr p passes. Remember please, when your p has good values u dont have to worr abt anything, so just natural mostly works well with a little ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: luck|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a LOT of ambiguity, and if 1N nonforcing then a 2C rebid by N shows 4+ clubs which is an adavantage. the question is how big an advantage it will be, and how often, and ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how these pros and cons measure against all the other ones that must be entered into the balance sheet to evaluate the respective methods|pg||
nt|rodal f: Spot to come and 3@C as the best but will NS fight with 3@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Blood to come?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not sure everyone agrees with 1@H at these colors....|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, 2@S by an opener and a min responder on a 5-2 fit in preference to a notional 4-4 3@C will at least be reasonable -- non-forcing 1NT can lead to a contract that is just ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: preposterous.|pg||

mb|p|nt|andersk: omg|pg||
nt|andersk: why didnt he pass and take out 2@S in 4 @H if that is the case|pg||
nt|rv: seems to be some confusion, 2@h double was intended as t/o or strong bal|pg||
nt|anton72: declarer have 10 and 9|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: Studentenes BK is on the board finally with an imp!|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sharkey: West won't mind defending either if pd has a @H stack|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sharkey: Yes Frank - blood to come...|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Minimum 800 while 3NT also is on by 600.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Only problem for defence may be that West has no trump to lead thru|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: best to play some sohl (lebensohl, rubensohl, rumpelsohl) from South hand on double of 2@h by North|pg||
nt|james_h: oh man|pg||
nt|djneill: North went all out for extra tricks by underleading the @dKQJ :-) declarer's stiff @d8 won|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: careful readers will note that at no point did i say that forcing NT is a bad method or that nonforcing NT is always the key to the city|pg||

nt|h_karluk: http://www.bridgehands.com/R/Rule_of_20.htm|pg||
nt|jaheim: time to take toptricks now|pg||
nt|rv: a practical option is one suggested by Anders which is passing with South hand|pg||
pc|c9|nt|djneill: ok 11 flat may not be an invite, but vulnerable at imps, you don't think - you trust to the randomness of the cards that gives you imp odds for game: just 37% vulnerable game ...|pg||
nt|djneill: required to break even, and that is not counting bad defense|pg||

nt|rodal f: 4@S at OR. So a new gain by 3IMP|pg||

pc|h5|nt|sybarra: as Joe Shair says:  "20 yrs ago it would have been considered a light opening bid"|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|sybarra: pointing towards the opening by S is the spade holding|pg||

pc|s7|nt|djneill: and South's @h pitch :-)|pg||
nt|djneill: either way, East should present a @h Jack or Ten, to induce a cover, even if really finessing the other way|pg||
nt|djneill: for instance, if East was on the board now, East could play the @hJ - planning on overtaking and hooking the other way|pg||
nt|djneill: North has no idea that East has the @hT so might just cover|pg||
nt|djneill: that extra chance takes you from 50% to maybe 70%, but here there are other clues to where the long @h are|pg||
nt|djneill: South doubled 1@h for takeout, so presumably has 8 @s and @d cards|pg||
nt|djneill: along with 2@c|pg||
nt|djneill: then South pitched a @h|pg||
nt|rodal f: Start tomorrow will be 10.00CET|pg||

nt|h_karluk: 4@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  any other contract beside 4@s here?|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems like the place to play |pg||
nt|jcwla: However, better than the OR 3NT.|pg||
nt|djneill: noticed on the 3@s that E-W actually went down here instead of taking the @d finesse, so that is more to the Studenten|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|rv: what should be margin of victory for NS to get atleast a solitary VP?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: NS can make 4@H; will they bid it after West's overcall?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will W try to bid or will NS find there best contract?|pg||
nt|djneill: Studenten found the 25 HCP game and now we are about even again|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sharkey: Thought W might overcall 1 NT...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or 3NT by no ruff posibilliyes? Hard to end there.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i did not like 2@s much|pg||

nt|sybarra: and they lost  7 back on bd 1|pg||

nt|sybarra: bd 11|pg||
mb|4C|nt|rodal f: Looks like a weak raise insteed of 3@H as many use as pre empt.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then Terje shldnt pass|pg||
nt|jcwla: A number of unappetizing choices here for W.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Do you prefer 4@H or 4@S on this hand?|pg||

nt|rodal f: Jacoby and splinter on now|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like hand was made overly complicated|pg||

nt|djneill: I think @cAKQxx opposite a 1@c opening is a bit encouraging, more than just 9 HCP|pg||
mb|p|pc|c4|nt|rodal f: No normal chance to bid the slam as I see or might Lars have a route 66?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: with only one ace, i think 3N is very dubious. 3H better then if S bids 3N fine|pg||

nt|rodal f: 2 times @H and @C give a pitch in @D at E and slam are on.|pg||
nt|jbgood: so 2 @s - and nobody agreed on 2@s |pg||
pc|c2|nt|mcarroll: and S again - again|pg||

pc|cA|nt|sharkey: One of those hand that plays well if pd just have trumps...|pg||

nt|djneill: if I was N-S and I knew about the 5-0 @h break, I would do anything but bleed all the trumps|pg||
nt|djneill: so defenders here should do likewise|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: @C lead works as well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 9 hcp, no trump support, perhaps 3C wld be mistaken, so easy X in competition|pg||

nt|vugraphzkn: Next session will start 14:45 local time|pg||
nt|mcarroll: a tough flat board|pg||
nt|jbgood: i guess the latter is in better position to know - he is on the team|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: I had the Students as one by two favorits, but the fieald is wide open this year.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are Petter having a problem to use the finger counting HP?:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder how they only made 5N in OR|pg||

nt|jcwla: to Roland Wald, the tireless coordinator of BBO vugraph presentations.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  NOT making 1 NT seems rather difficult, losing 4 @h, 1 @C and 1@S|pg||
nt|jaheim:   1 NTstill 10 -13   |pg||

mb|3N|nt|sharkey: Will EW let opps play in 5@D Dbl?|pg||

nt|sybarra: and thx to our terrific operator, Gier |pg||

nt|andyv:  in NT|pg||
nt|jcwla: Finally, big thanks to my fellow commentators for their excellent insights: Lars Arthur Johansen and Marshall Lewis, and of course thanks to all specs.|pg||
nt|djneill: North should pass - short @h implies E-W are missing a @h fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: @dA+ruff?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: XX = 3S|pg||
nt|sybarra: and of course thx to our specs, with all the commdents we appreciate them |pg||

nt|rodal f: Thanks also to the fellow comentators wich have made it a bit more easy for all of us. Specs as commentators as vug operators:) Well done.|pg||
nt|djneill: it may come down to the @c guess|pg||
nt|djneill: but there are endplay possibilities in @s too - @s and another means South will win and possibly give a ruff-sluff|pg||
nt|djneill: as North did not lead the @sK, there is small hint that South has doubleton honor|pg||
nt|djneill: @sQ here may solve it|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodal f: Got that because of his wild biddings when ma - pa - Tora(sister) and Torstein played privat.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||

nt|james_h: this has been an excecise in excruciation for Forde - all efforts backfired|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rodal f: No hook for shure. Its team and not match:)|pg||
