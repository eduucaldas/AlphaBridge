nt|jaapfr: are EW female students:)?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Also part of the explanation why when it's not clear who owns the hand or who can make what, the 5 level belongs to the opponents.|pg||
nt|lestergold: why do i call you Frank it should be Rodal its psychological sorry|pg||
nt|jaheim: strange 6 sp with only K8xx in @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: EW plays 5-5-4-2 and transfers after 1cl openings|pg||
nt|djneill: in fact, I wonder why South didn't act earlier :-)  12 HCP good 5 card suit NV|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill: does anyone know if East is related to Geir Helgemo|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sharkey: off 1 or 2?|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: another @S contract,  better trumph this time  :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodal f: Or a auto stop at 2@H?|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h should make |pg||
nt|rodal f: Looks as Ekrens 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: it is |pg||
nt|jaheim: but 9 tricks max|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - 8 to be exact - both ways|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: A rarity - a weak 2@D opener|pg||
nt|sharkey: the previous board was down 2 - not 1 - will be corrected|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to find A@c and Q@c lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: good vuln save|pg||
nt|andyv:  down at least 500|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx Torstein:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes they may stretch too far on this one too|pg||
nt|djneill: how many @s now, shirley?|pg||
nt|djneill: 2@s, 3@s seem the options|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rodal f: This contract is playable by a dobble hook in @C|pg||
nt|hagz: 3 NT makes, 6 @c makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: looks reasonable - unless the 4-1 @H break becomes a problem|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here is a good example of a hand that natural bidders should open 1@D.|pg||
nt|larsarthur: south is not sure about @dfit|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Marshall Lewis|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hi all :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Must be prepared for all continuations -- here, 1@D and then 3@C and you feel much better than this.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@c seems a better contract ironically|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  now it's serious:)|pg||
nt|larsarthur: lowest 4-card is std in Norway|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Marshalll.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hagz: Hard to guess @s in 3 NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Just one thing left to do! Bid the 6er....|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually isnt 3n a trick short on a heart lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: A @D lead appears to be best for defence|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S had only 4 losers imo|pg||
nt|jcwla: Interesting to know but that doesn't begin and end the conversation for me in terms of how best to describe this hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Anders Kristensen and GeO Tislevoll (partly)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Running scores at  http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1074140R|pg||
nt|djneill: thanks Geir Harnes, who says East is a cousin of Geir Helgemo|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: there are arguments on both sides, but you aren;lt getting full value for money out of sputnik if you follow the same sequence with this S hand and also on   xx  AKx   xx  Axxxxx|pg||
nt|james_h: tricky rebid in normal systems for south, no such difficulty here 1@s must be 5?|pg||
nt|rv: 1@s possibly shows 5@s here|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi folks!|pg||
nt|geot: Hi friends:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 1 spade was not forcing|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Andres, wlc|pg||
nt|james_h: Hi Geo|pg||
nt|djneill: 3@s shows an unbalanced hand typically, but occasionally 4522 - East has a sharp hand, so at IMPs the idea is to just bid game and hope to make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice name to have going into competition |pg||
nt|djneill: yep|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  on @s lead, can N still hold it down to only 4 losers?|pg||
nt|andyv:  without dbl dummying the @c suit?|pg||
nt|james_h: Hi Anders|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rodal f: If any want to look at the pairs systemcards u find them here: http://www.nmlag.com/Systemkort til the turney is fin|pg||
nt|jcwla: When the clubs are significantly stronger or you will be able to handle all continuations, I have no problem with 1@C.  Here, a rebid problem such as this was reasonably likely.|pg||
nt|hagz: yeah, there is only one entrance the the dummy to get the @s tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This might have - regarding the bidding - about 7Â½ % chance to make|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: i suppose 2d sgowing i assume 4 spades might pick them|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant be done really |pg||
nt|hagz: Can't get them|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to make a decision as to how to tackle the diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: can play i suppose to ruff 2 hearts in dummy|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you ask then too much|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in other words, i think the disadvantages of 1C outweight the advantages|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cK|nt|andersk: If you all look at the butler scoores, then you understand why Im here and not playing:)|pg||

nt|geot: sure. We have all been there:)|pg||
nt|andersk: lets see if Hjelmeland can male this|pg||
nt|andersk: make|pg||
nt|rv: declarer needs to take @s finesse, if he plays @s from top, 4-1 break might scuttle the contract|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h8|nt|sharkey: Not many use weak 2@D opener - I believe it sometimes is very effective|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway -500 not too bad for NS:)|pg||
nt|djneill: there is a general rule that against 3-suiters, you want to lead trumps - it is just a rule that works - and West has a semi-3suited hand, so South's trump switch was reasonable|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  true|pg||
nt|andyv:  vs. 550:)|pg||
nt|andersk: probably misses it now|pg||
nt|james_h: If this score was a mountain, I'd stay at base camp :)|pg||
nt|rv: he might go down playing for 3-2 break|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant go wrong as cards lie|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe he will top play, since they are 65 behindf|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcwla: On Board 1, 5@D was doubled in the OR and made on the lead of the @CT.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mcarroll: 9 tricks the limit - can set up a long @H for @C discard|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hagz: wd|pg||
nt|andersk: and he did|pg||
nt|djneill: nothing to say here, 3-3 @h and 3-2 @s|pg||

nt|lestergold: good slam to bid and make|pg||

mb|1D|nt|andyv:  ok, I'm blind... where did the @d loser go?|pg||
nt|djneill: other room starting with the end of the set: brds 15 and 16, so we will get results in a few minutes for brd 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S hand a reasonable opening at these colors|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will they try a new hard one NS?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nope.|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie e/w has more play for 4@s than n/s has for 4@h in spite of the hcp distribution in n/s favour|pg||
nt|lestergold: north passing i assume a strong nt holding a 9 count??|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it happens its a winning decision|pg||

nt|andyv:  you dbl with S hand 2N here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Still in US Carl?|pg||
nt|sharkey: since 3@D makes gain 1 imp|pg||
nt|rv: my personal belief is if you are down by any margin (large or small), it is best to play as accurately as possible and hope for luck and opps to make mistakes, playing against odds ...|pg||
nt|rv: is not correct strategy ever:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: a scary bidding board|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: -200 or even -300 to punish W for his 2nt bd|pg||
nt|andyv:  I like when I raise my partner's suit and he/she finds another suit to lead.|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all sorry I am late |pg||
nt|andyv:  never to late, Shirley:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi Shirley|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: no - sunny Stavanger :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect if D were Kxx and clubs KQxx, he would have been more likely to open|pg||
nt|djneill: ok @h lead which gives up the suit, but if South ducks, there goes the entry to the @c, so South should rise with the @hA|pg||
nt|djneill: @c behave, so 10 tops - 6@c, 2@h, 1@s, 1@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: can not get greedy on this hand |pg||
pc|hA|nt|larsarthur: probably|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  too:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i dislike 2nt bid W|pg||
nt|andyv:  because of 3rd seat opener, S was not tempted to dbl opps into game|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree with u Mike. A invit would have been normal.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|rodal f: OK. So nice weather there two:) Welcome back home.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  I don't mind it... W is a passed hand and can expect a bit better @c suit than pd put down|pg||
nt|jcwla: Pass seems normal on the actual hand, though reasonable intermediates and medium spots make it look not totally watered-down.|pg||
nt|andersk: still 4 matches to go, and a long way to go, so medal is still possible if we improve!|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I second that; I have been in that position too often for comfort|pg||
pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: once again it may be systemic, but i am not keen on the sequence chosen by E here. Even facing a PH, this E hand has significant game potential in a suit, so i would want to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maximize our opportunities to show suits|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 20 HCP and 4 card support for pard, e will be disappointed there is no Grand slam|pg||
nt|james_h: I do sometimes do in the last segment of the Bermuda Bowl when 16+ behind|pg||
nt|rv: @C lead and @d switch required to beat this which is double dummy defebse|pg||

nt|sharkey: been here a while now - only leave during cold season...|pg||
nt|jaheim: Flått is prob thinking about the Q of @H|pg||

nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s what I doÂ´nt like with 2 NT - how many @H has West - you never know|pg||
nt|rv: normal @d lead should result in 10 tricks|pg||
nt|andersk: When all 5 players have been under pari, it is not easy. The easy part is that we cant blame any but ouhrselves:)|pg||
nt|djneill: yes, only way for more than 10 is if opponents pitch hearts and spades|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rv: Anders, are the top Norwegian pairs like Helgemo-Helness, Grotheim-Tundal, Brogeland-pd playing this event?|pg||
nt|andersk: No|pg||
nt|andersk: They are not qualyfied (Im not sure if they played from start)|pg||
nt|james_h: and Geo has gone south for the Spring|pg||
nt|geot: :)|pg||
nt|andersk: This event is played like 6 rounds of knockout matches, then 8 teams meet for a final long weekend|pg||
nt|james_h: and NZ dollars :)|pg||
nt|geot: he he|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rv: ok, still presume quality of bridge on display is quite high|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hawe45:  Perfect|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|rodal f: LOL:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and pray clubs behave|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sharkey: cannot see any possibility of this making - but have a poor track record in predicting....|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: well he has picked the hearts well|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  question really is if E should leave the 2N bid in|pg||
nt|jaapfr: good question imo:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 6NT to guard the @S tenace|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcwla: Eh la la.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s5|nt|jaapfr: but 3@C will get a X by S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: although i still like 3@C by E|pg||
nt|lestergold: can make 3N on this line|pg||
nt|jaheim: soon  next board  zzzzzzzz|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|djneill: South is pressurizing E-W with the long suit - sometimes odd things happen|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: has to play safe tho to ensure 1N|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andyv:  I like 3@c just to keep my partners happy|pg||

pc|c9|nt|jaapfr: :)|pg||
nt|james_h: my experience is that there is great strength in depth in Norge|pg||
pc|d3|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|dJ|nt|jcwla: I agree with you, Marshall -- I don't think some of these 1@C openings give enough thought to the rebid.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzkn: we have to reset the tables brb|pg||
nt|larsarthur: ok|pg||
nt|jcwla: The @D plays just way too helpful here.|pg||
nt|jcwla: E also made a really nice play in @H's at T2.|pg||

nt|andyv:  amazing that they've never led the suit they bid and raised:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if he counted well it is easy to trow @HQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: N was probably afraid he was leading into ajx in W |pg||
nt|andyv:  true..but that would require paying attention:)|pg||
nt|andersk: to make the fianl you have to win 6 knock out matches first|pg||

mb|d|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: South misplayed that last one, imho - win @HA, cash @CA, but then overtake the queen with the king. Now you can force out the jack even if they are 4-1|pg||

nt|vugraphzkn: N diddent see pds 1nt opening|pg||
nt|andersk: top 8 club teams, this year:)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: I think e/w will try 4 @S here at the end of the day |pg||
nt|jaapfr: still   Studentenes sounds very female to me but do not master Norwegian|pg||
nt|andyv:  S took a far more aggressive stance on board 1 and found the excellent save of 5@d for 9 imp gain|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR|pg||
nt|rv: so quality of bridge on display should definitely be of high standard|pg||
nt|djneill: that @h suit was an example of keeping the final contract in sight, and not mechanically play the suit by itself |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: On Board 1 Studentenes have picked up 11 IMPs - not 10.  6@S at this table was off 2.  This will be corrected|pg||
nt|rodal f: By his 9HP Forfot ain't fare away for a normalopening.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sharkey: Shud be some action here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3@C some kind of mixed raise?|pg||
nt|jcwla: N must be thinking it's a pinochle deck.|pg||
nt|rodal f: So by the screens N are same blind I am witout screens?:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah that explains |pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: funny faces in here :-)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: So far NS have not been able to introduce their @D suit - may be too late now|pg||
nt|sybarra: or will E venture 3 nt at some point |pg||
nt|andyv:  actually N deserves the credit for dbling 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
mb|1N|nt|djneill: West opens a feather light vulnerable 1@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: we also have another team event plaing like a premier leuage, two 2. divisjons 8 3. divisjons etc, premier leuage is the top team event, this is the top club team event|pg||
nt|rv: do EW play standard or a limited system?|pg||
nt|james_h: Any kibs have outline system info?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 5-5-4-2 with transfers after 1cl openings|pg||
nt|djneill: unsupported Queen and Jack are dubious|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: south cannot make anything at the 3 level|pg||
nt|sybarra: but its a good hand! |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Kib informs 3@C asks for strength and suit quality|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6!@S probably down 1 although 5@S likely to be +1|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sharkey: 3 NT shows max|pg||
nt|rodal f: U have the funniest any way Torstein:) I will come to Ålesund tomorrow non. Will be nice to see u again.|pg||
nt|djneill: you like the long @d suit shirley?  looks nice|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6/4 with spades |pg||
nt|mcarroll: not quite a Roland 19-21 and it looks like the 19 count wins|pg||
nt|djneill: welcome martin|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphzkn: NS precision club|pg||
nt|andersk: normally there are 5-8 very good teams in this team final, some years the level is not abselout top|pg||
nt|geot: The nightmare for Førde seems to continue. The 4@S North went down in here (board 18) was played in 4@H at the other table, won by Cantona Nybo. 13 impsmore|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Dan, Shirley|pg||
nt|djneill: ok so another entry-related hand|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: so wise of NS to stay out of the bidding as appears 5@D x wud be off 800|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jaapfr: good leading technique|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rv: par contract is 5@d for EW though 4@s makes as well|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like PA is trying to play 4@S |pg||
pc|d6|nt|geot: In 5@D you have to guess the trumps|pg||
nt|james_h: another reason to take the normal line|pg||
nt|djneill: pretty much no way to get to the @d so East must duck a @d, even if South covers|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|andyv:  W's 5@s bid asked for what?|pg||
nt|andyv:  club control or trump?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @S support i say|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi:) Normaly trumh cuality.|pg||
nt|andyv:  if so, then 6@s was optomistic by E|pg||
nt|rodal f: quality*|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even wrong bid E|pg||
nt|rv: how many brds per round, we seem to have started off with a huge score in favor or Namsos BK?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: as he does|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jcwla: Will we get a failing @H finesse?|pg||
nt|geot: 16 boards|pg||
nt|andersk: 16 a round  32 a match|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: apparently systemic to open 1H on the W hand|pg||
pc|cK|nt|larsarthur: how can it fail?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|sharkey: i predict 10 tricks - probably wrong again....|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jaapfr: better claim down 1 to make dummy not too ashamed:)|pg||
nt|rv: East will pass and West will bid 5@d to deny first round control|pg||
pc|c6|nt|geot: So easy for us, seeing all cards.....to play the trumps without a loser. Not that easy at the table|pg||
nt|james_h: indeed|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rv: if cue bid is doubled by opps, redouble shows first round control, bidding another suit shows cue in that suit and promises second round control of suit|pg||
nt|djneill: so South must think - is there a possible layout that gives us 3 more tricks outside of @d immediately|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: if the EW carding is to be believed, the heart queen is with E|pg||
nt|andersk: might get the @D right now, since N doubled 5@C|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|rodal f: Mildly said. E is Erlend Skjetne fro the Norwegian Junior team older.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @S seemed a bit much in the first place|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
nt|djneill: maybe pd has the @sT|pg||
nt|sybarra: must have been something I said,  booted right out of the room |pg||

pc|sA|nt|djneill: oof|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|sharkey: The students picked up another 6 IMPs on bd 2 when 3@D failed in OR|pg||
nt|rodal f: At board 2 EW went surpricing -1 at 3@D and 6IMP for the Students from Trondheim.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E would not respond 1S on a balanced 4-count vulnerab;le|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: not sure why west didnt over ruff and play abither dim|pg||
nt|rv: wd|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s5|pc|sT|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Which major du you lead?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: Many use sidecolor at jacoby in Norway.|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Stop the E/W wagon, I want to get off|pg||
nt|rv: once partner doesn't super-accept your transfer, you would tend to pass with 8 hcp and invite only with 9 on 5332 or 5422 shape|pg||
nt|james_h: 4s easier in practice|pg||
nt|andersk: Førde again trying to get back by bidding too much|pg||

nt|andersk: abselout supermax in North, still no chanse to make a game, can it be right?|pg||

nt|james_h: I tend to go with all 9 hcp except flat with no 10's and 9's|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: You as many others would have done I belive. It's only a @C lead that keep them of 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|djneill: knowing the split - any singleton with East leaves 4 @d losers, North is not unhappy to let West ruff|pg||
nt|djneill: when West passes a 2-level takeout, it shows a stack|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  I see more of an advantage for DONT in direct seat... in pass out seat, something simpler might be better|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
nt|sharkey: Even with @C lead I believe slam makes as @D set up|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South was end-played in the lead - only one of three could beat 3 NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: and passing one levels can be even worse |pg||

nt|lestergold: north's 2 points are working very haARD INDEED|pg||
nt|djneill: ok in other room brd 2, same contract and defense, but East embarked on a total crossruff that was unlucky when North was short in @c - one trick short|pg||

nt|lestergold: yje stiff hert is an obvious value to N but how can he know how imprtant the Q@c is?|pg||
nt|djneill: ok a 3crd @h raise - it is fine but takes a little judgement or gadgetry to then show that - I think requiring 4 cards is a reasonable agreement|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sharkey: S is being pragmatic opening the 5 card @S suit - this in order he'll be able to show both suits|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  2N usually an invite since you have 2@c and 3@c to show a variety of @s raises|pg||
nt|djneill: after 2 trumps, West knows there is no pt to playing a third and will get the @s ruff|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hawe45:  BUT: @D - and @S to the 10 (50-50) = SEVEN tricks|pg||

pc|s3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|djneill: ok now West will make 5 on a black squeeze if North cashes a @d now|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|sharkey: As expected Grand picked up IMPs on Bd 3 where EW let 3@H make|pg||
nt|rodal f: But all up to how strong the 2@D bid can be. It often use to be wide in Norway.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i dont think there is any harm in sp[lintering ion the way f u are prepared to jumop to 4 level in any case|pg||
nt|djneill: South must guard @s and @c|pg||
nt|djneill: and it plays like a double squeeze since the @d9 is a threat against North|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the second @D will kill S |pg||
pc|s5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|djneill: it's good of West to do this on purpose, right, for our entertainment?  ruffing @s would be so basic (is there a serious way that would go down?)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|hawe45:  ... and we shall add the singleton @S Ace in North...!|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h8|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: re CR - N passed pd's opening so 4@D not unreasonable after E bid 1@S|pg||

nt|mdgraham: but there may some system implications that I am unaware of|pg||

nt|vugraphzkn: 2 nt was stenberg|pg||

nt|h_karluk: their column. They've many special treatments, absolutely not classic|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has a choice oer 1S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Best idea is to claim - |pg||
nt|rv: one of the reasons K/O matches are preferred in final stages of ACBL and World events is because of this strategy of teams not doing well playing anti-percentage bridge|pg||
nt|djneill: do you think other table will have gotten to the slam at the other table, martin?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rodal f: Multi|pg||
nt|marlowepi: american tendency is 2C then double|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: I believe Grand BK is one of the country's oldest bridge clubs with lots of traditions|pg||
nt|sybarra: so using multi|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If  @Hs are supported immediately I would bet on the slam being bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: p/c 2H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: p/c=pass correct|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodal f: 31HP NS and will stop at level 5 I presume.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam on a finesse|pg||
nt|rodal f: But will get 2 aces away by 4NT.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: useful for NS to play transfers in this situation|pg||
nt|sybarra: may hear screeching of brakes at both tables |pg||
nt|djneill: true, 3-4 support is more encouraging than 3crd after a checkback sequence|pg||
nt|djneill: North passed and South lost breath|pg||
mb|4D|nt|andyv:  agree, Hamdi... that's what makes this game so fascinating|pg||

nt|rodal f: But a interestin @C contract EW.|pg||
nt|rv: in Round Robin, teams not doing well can really upset the field by not playing seriously|pg||
nt|andersk: 2 NT now from Ringset|pg||
nt|andersk: unbalanced GF|pg||
nt|james_h: 3?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  W not elated with the dbl|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The defence to the Multi Two Diamonds is fundamentally different from the defence to a weak two for a number of reasons: |pg||
nt|andyv:  2N leb?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then can raise to 2S in two different ways, distinguishing pure obstruction from some genuine values|pg||
nt|djneill: some might open South's hand 2@c based on the large number of tricks, right?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes I think the S hand should use whatever forcing opening they use, I would open 2@C|pg||
nt|djneill: 2@c being a strong ART bid, for any poles|pg||
mb|5D|nt|h_karluk: The direct defender always gets two opportunities to bid. |pg||
nt|jaheim: Strong cl NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  looks like it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The 4th seat defender usually gets two opportunities to bid.|pg||
nt|andersk: Maybe they dont play 2 NT as unbalanced GF|pg||
nt|rv: anyone for transfers on 1m-1n?|pg||
nt|james_h: I prefer 2n to 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Our excellent operator, Torstein Hesseberg, informs me the club is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year - also followed by a big tournement this fall|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not shure there|pg||
nt|larsarthur: 1 or 2 imp back to vikersund|pg||
nt|djneill: North, having passed, has 4 card support, a working @hQ, and a side doubleton - yeah I think 5@d is an underbid :-)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: The defence do not know opener's hand type immediately. |pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems so now. When 3@H came|pg||
nt|andyv:  looking for 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 2 nt 3 cl 3h should be alerted|pg||
nt|h_karluk: So does that make defending against the multi 2? easier or more difficult than against a weak two? In my opinion there's no problem  as long as you are sensible about it. ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Basically, assume that the 2D opener has a weak 2H/S hand. |pg||
nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx Torstein:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: :-)|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would expect most to double.  Meanwhile, this seems somewhat meek.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|h_karluk: There are numerous variations of the multi 2D, so let's assume a fairly basic one (weak major; strong minor or strong balanced). The suggested defence does not really change if ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there are other possibilities such as 4441 distributions  assume a weak opener. |pg||
nt|andyv:  like all systems...after a while a decent defense or multiple defenses are found and then we wait for the newest development.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: this is my laste Geir will now join |pg||
nt|lestergold: well both n/s stretching their values here |pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: bye all see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|rv: if Ringseth's had a stiff major, he could have jumped to 3M to show stiff and long @DS|pg||
nt|rv: unfortunately 3@c on 1@d-1n shows both minors and 18+hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: I hate  2 @c on unbalanced,  (tough to describe) hard to catch up |pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: ht lead looks likely and no play|pg||

nt|lestergold: bye Torstien|pg||

nt|sybarra: that 9 of @S in dummy is a big card |pg||
nt|james_h: another find the lady hand|pg||
nt|rv: in any case it is best to play some science, either transfers or artificial 2n response as suggested by Anders|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you can freely bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: as is the club holding |pg||
nt|andyv:  but will be difficult to find Q@d unless following the Crane rule:)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: and crane rule is?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rodal f: Well done Torstein and welcome to Geir as the new vug operator. See u tomorrow.|pg||
nt|lestergold: both final bids were overbids in my book|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was it?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andyv:  Q was under the J in the minor and over the J in the major|pg||
nt|andyv:  and don't ask me why that works... seemed to have worked for him:)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|sharkey: The venue of this championship is Ålesund - a scenic town of about 60,000 inhabitants on the west coast of Norway.  |pg||

pc|hQ|nt|rv: wd|pg||
nt|andersk: red card:)|pg||
nt|andersk: @H 4|pg||
nt|djneill: well 1@h certainly worked out here, but had East passed it would not have - the idea is that a void ensures you will not play it at the 1-level|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a lot depends on how bad N can be for for 2S and--especially--whether NS have multiple ways to raise to 2S. if they do and N has already shown dreck, then he could be turned on by ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the 3H bid...although with 11 losers and bad trumps it is still hard to bid 4S. if they dont have 2 ways to raise to 2S, N can hardly bid a game even though he has heart values|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@S by 10HP and 10X by often 6@Ss in S seems OK at me.|pg||
nt|rv: in case Flatt is just dropping off:)|pg||
nt|andersk: yep:)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: [erhaps the 3@s invite was the more optimistic of the two bids|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|c8|nt|sybarra: and declarer not going right unfortunately |pg||

pc|c4|pc|s4|pc|c7|pg||

nt|mcarroll: I play after 2@C, pd must bid a waiting 2D now 2@H< @S 3@C@D shows 8 playing tricks|pg||
nt|djneill: one way for E-W to look at this is that they balanced N-S into a game(slam) - but another better way to look at it is that this is completely normal, next hand, forget this one|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Feel 2@S a bit hard there. Ain't re X better?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i prefer the 1s overcall to start with and then later the takeout double as recommended in Robert Owen's excellent book on doubes etc|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Very much so!|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  when the 5 card suit is @ss and you only have 2@h, it seems like 1@s is more efficient....if the 5 card suit is @H, then the advantage of 1N is a preemptive bid against @ss.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: looking into future is not a bad thing, however i am expected to tell partner what i have in my hands|pg||

nt|rodal f: Inv minor 10HP+ at 2@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@h??|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Was told that NS was in the final in 2000 and 2004, so there 3rd one now.|pg||

nt|lestergold: south shopul;d have donned brown corduroy trousers and barraged big time|pg||
nt|djneill: West has 9 HCP and a source of tricks vulnerable opposite 15-17, I hope West thinks this is forcing, and also hope East does|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: I didn't exspect the Q there. Had time to wait:(|pg||
nt|sharkey: Afraid of @S shift|pg||
nt|sharkey: This hand plays better Double Dummy - Skjetne's play not unreasonable |pg||

nt|jcwla: Yeah playing forcing NT they would get to 2@S.|pg||

pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: 2S might well make, i was thinking of 3C|pg||
nt|hagz: OR 7 @c|pg||
nt|djneill: ok only way this goes down is if West ruffs high on the 3rd @c, but the @s6 then !7 is not from shortness - did South show 4@s specifically I wonder|pg||
nt|djneill: 3rd @s sorry|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: forgive the expression but being a money player ui dont like paying out to vul grannies|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well i dont fully understand bidding system, but was this that difficuklt a grand to reach|pg||
nt|rodal f: As Mike said.          The bid from W was 5@H over 3@H.|pg||
nt|lestergold: nol i said that south should have bid 5@h to take up space but having only bid 3@h west needed 5@h as unambiguous void showing and grand slam try|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|djneill: important to inquire about agreements, at least above the club level (then it just helps them )|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|jcwla: That's not happening -- at least not as a result of forcing NT.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, non-forcing NT would be a lovely idea if 1NT meant "I have a nice balanced minimum responding hand."|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  undertrick time|pg||
nt|jcwla: Unfortunately, much of the time it means "I have some shapely hand that doesn't have enough strength to bid at the 2 level."|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bidding small only wsas very expensive i think specs would mostly understand that as meaning the only thing it coluld mean|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: yes it is fairly normal to bid 2S despite the poor holding and the good clubs--my point is that playing forcing NT really S has no idea of which black suit will be best|pg||
nt|rodal f: It's exslution blackwood. HOW many aces do u have pard exsept in @H|pg||
pc|c3|nt|djneill: South pitched a low @c, probably encouragement|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: what was that 12 imps or so|pg||
nt|lestergold: and e/w cannot afford yhis sort of loss|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 6 clubs showed 2 aces and a void|pg||
nt|rv: they are not bagelled (6-0 in tennis) or got a pair (0 in cricket)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|djneill: which is important if North has the @cK and not the @sQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: there was a way to beat this,  but certainly no evidient to either n or s |pg||

nt|vugraphzkn: It is nice to be in rama, Hoff says:)|pg||
nt|djneill: West downgrades from 15 due to the flat and bad Quacks, do you like that martin?|pg||

nt|vugraphzkn: Jan is in the tank|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: After2@S I feel 3@C as force and a free bid.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andersk: One thing is certain, It was not clear to Hoff, put the cards in and pick up a new board|pg||

nt|jaheim: Wonder how weak 1 NT was|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sharkey: On Board 11 N bid 1@H OR as well thus -800 and a push likely in 2@Hx|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i remember this 2@s 's american version, tartan bicolors weak|pg||
nt|rv: does East's 3@s show 3 or 4 card raise Inv hand?|pg||
nt|rv: here both East with good controls and 5 card suit could have pushed on to game|pg||
nt|andersk: Im gonna rund down and watch and scoore, cya all|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sharkey: Sry - Bd 10|pg||

nt|mcarroll: propose a 54321 count with Ace = 5 and Ten = 1|pg||
nt|djneill: this @d suit seems obvious to play the @dQ, but there is extra things going on - East can take a safe hook in @h into North's hand to protect the @dQ whoever has the @dK|pg||

nt|marlowepi: identical minors in dummy|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: in europe maybe sthng like muiderberg |pg||

nt|djneill: as usual, the auction has clues|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|djneill: and South's @h pitch :-)|pg||
nt|djneill: either way, East should present a @h Jack or Ten, to induce a cover, even if really finessing the other way|pg||
nt|djneill: for instance, if East was on the board now, East could play the @hJ - planning on overtaking and hooking the other way|pg||
nt|djneill: North has no idea that East has the @hT so might just cover|pg||
nt|djneill: that extra chance takes you from 50% to maybe 70%, but here there are other clues to where the long @h are|pg||
nt|djneill: South doubled 1@h for takeout, so presumably has 8 @s and @d cards|pg||
nt|djneill: along with 2@c|pg||
nt|djneill: then South pitched a @h|pg||
pc|h6|nt|djneill: so at this point, the odds go with North having the long @h|pg||

nt|jaheim: mm,  i dont think that NS are looking forward to the half time comparasing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah I am told 1@C is a transfer to @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Something wrong with the cards. They know the hands. Getting TD to check now. Going to 16 first.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  My advice: Tell teammates, that "we were sitting wrong as E/W"...|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A spec came wit 3@S from S as a good raise then 4 might would have becomed a small slam try?|pg||

mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: thx all |pg||
nt|sybarra: and the X is?  "cards"  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3 in a row 4@s|pg||
nt|jcwla: Evjen failed in 3NT on 13 in the OR - so the rout is on.|pg||
nt|sybarra: well that overcall keeps n/s out of their ht "fit" |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: On Bd 14 S Dbl OR but failed to bid 4@S over 4@Hso looks like a push|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be Shirley|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 5T contrat desire|pg||
nt|james_h: but 6d maked|pg||
nt|james_h: makes|pg||
nt|rv: interesting defensive problem here|pg||
nt|djneill: lol|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Surely does|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: They are playing with screens so the thinking don't matter that much as at open tables.|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: well, kind of :-)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharkey: Hartvigsen's 3@C VUL not for the faint hearted....|pg||
nt|jcwla: A light passed-hand double by W - usually a good idea.|pg||
nt|djneill: N-S are playing in @h anyways, for 50 a pop|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rodal f: Who know Shirley?:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodal f: I understand Remvik's 4@C. Hartvigsen should have been a bit stronger for his 3@C bid.|pg||
nt|hagz: 5 @c makes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with only one ace, i think 3N is very dubious. 3H better then if S bids 3N fine|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|djneill: we can see North has opened 1@d instead of 1@h, with the same 4432 shape|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rodal f: Neg use to be normal.|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty all...wonderful show put on by all... and ty specs for your comments and help|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S snatches defeat from the jaws of victory - again|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But E gets in on the act|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mcarroll: and S again - again|pg||
nt|rv: North should duck first and second @hs to set this contract|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sharkey: One of those hand that plays well if pd just have trumps...|pg||
nt|sharkey: @D lead wud have ensured defeat|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|djneill: so East can play this as if he is defending @h |pg||
nt|djneill: unfortunately, there is no @s finesse when N-S can see West's hand|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|rv: now he should hop with @sA and cash out|pg||
nt|rv: not easy at all|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcwla: And Smith failed in 3NT on 14 -- so the lead plumps to 40.  Welcome to all who've joined us from the OR.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|djneill: 4@s was reached in the other room, and the 500 did score a few imps for E-W|pg||
pc|sK|nt|larsarthur: flat board here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N could bid 3D too, but 3H sends more of a message that N is worried about spades|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|djneill: if I was N-S and I knew about the 5-0 @h break, I would do anything but bleed all the trumps|pg||
nt|djneill: so defenders here should do likewise|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sharkey: @C lead works as well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 9 hcp, no trump support, perhaps 3C wld be mistaken, so easy X in competition|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  good session for BK Grand which was able to stretch out it's lead|pg||
nt|james_h: right, the club situation not clear for N|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|james_h: up to that point|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mcarroll: a double would have led to a 71-0 score|pg||

nt|mdgraham: rather hard to reach 2@h from here|pg||
nt|sharkey: after @SQ lead perhaps more...|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3@c probably pass/correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: assuming 2@s was spades+minor|pg||
nt|sharkey: what does he do holding a long @C suit?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possibly redouble|pg||
nt|sharkey: wud think 2 NT wud ask for pd's minor|pg||
nt|mdgraham: known in USA as a Parking Lot Redouble - requests pard to  bid the next suit (if LHO passes)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and oyu then either pass or bid your long suit. If you play 2NT as a relay, you can then us it after a double|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: trump lead, please|pg||

nt|djneill: it may come down to the @c guess|pg||
nt|djneill: but there are endplay possibilities in @s too - @s and another means South will win and possibly give a ruff-sluff|pg||
nt|djneill: as North did not lead the @sK, there is small hint that South has doubleton honor|pg||
