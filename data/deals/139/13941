nt|bjacobs: If the 10 draws the king, a heart to the ace and a third diamond still loses out for declarer|pg||

nt|mdgraham: it would be nicer to have all teams playing the same boards, though|pg||
nt|jtr: Makes for more interest in the bar afterwards too|pg||
nt|jallerton: same in most midweek leagues round the country, which are usually played at people's houses|pg||
nt|patricck: Indeed it was a good contract, but with @H 3-0 the defence really wasn't too difficult to beat it|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ehsana: played in the wrong  major but survived|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: 1@s = 5+@H|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4 hearts decent on 16 too imo|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzks: ofcourse with a little help from defence|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|yr: so they need a 19 imp swing on this partscore deal to win, impossible:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jallerton: 2@d = good @h raise|pg||
nt|jtr: Missed an easy game:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yr: great performance by both the finalists, & the team which held its nerve emerges as the national champions of 2010|pg||
nt|patricck: collecting 800, 1100 or even 1400 would be better than making a non vul 4@H tho|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|jtr: Dont like the system at all if they cant reach 4@h|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: you talk from experiance, patrick|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|patricck: meanwhile this looks like a push result. 4@S a reasonable contract but needed some of the trumps onside|pg||
nt|iain sime: This is an unlucky 4@S bid in both rooms. So Steel has an 11 imp lead (scores reversed on scoresheet). |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|yr: they will represent pakistan in the commonwealth games schedualed later this year in new dehli India|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|jallerton: South (or North) might have doubled 2@h|pg||
nt|patricck: just over half ann hour until the next segment starts. Looks like this could be a close match|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so thanks to all in Edinburgh and see you soon|pg||

mb|p|nt|jallerton: can N/S stop out og game?|pg||
nt|jallerton: *of|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jtr: Did well to stop, sort of, at the other table|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I assume all balanced hands are opened 1@C by the N-S pair in the closed room|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jallerton: yes, it's a shame South opened a non-systemic 1@C|pg||
nt|patricck: N/S can do very well in hearts, but difficult to know which one of them was supposed to enter the auction|pg||
nt|iain sime: North South have missed a decent 4@H here.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Oh, is it|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: trump lead sort of marked here|pg||
nt|jtr: Some open 1@c on any balanced hand|pg||
nt|jtr: But not this pair it seems?|pg||
nt|jallerton: no, both N/S pairs systemically open 1@D with 4|pg||
nt|jtr: My style too|pg||
nt|jallerton: at this stable, East seems to have bid some of North's hand|pg||
nt|patricck: 3 rounds of trumps stops 4@H I think|pg||
nt|iain sime: It looks like that means only five hearts and four tricks in the minors, but wheer there is nine a tenth often appears.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: Pros and cons. The advantage of opening 1@C on 2+ is that 1@D is 5+ unless 4441|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|jallerton: "transferred king" with an opponent is a new concept|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c9|nt|iain sime: Bidding 4@H might have stampeded East into 5@C minus one. |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jtr: Makes a change, he usually bids both opponents cards|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||

nt|paulg:  But neither Walker or Steel think I can bid :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "4@C W -4 -400" there's a certain fourness about that score|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|paulg:  i guess Sanders was hoping for heart shortage ...  and another trump ... and some higher cards|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: in other words, a completely different haqnd|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|galadriel: "Thank yo partner - now please put down the hand you bid with" :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|paulg:  it hasn't really changed during the auction|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bjacobs: In this case, it seems both East and West overbid by approximately equal amounts|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess West might say that he could have bid 3@h with a proper raise and 3@s is purely competitive|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|paulg:  actually i'm SURE that is what West will say but perhaps out of earshot of his partner :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|iain sime: John Holland is a current English international from Manchhester. Clive owen is also English from Darlington.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jtr: Hmmm  Struggling with that|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|lilac9: 3c here looks like a good limit raise in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: It must be western Turkish i think|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jallerton: Garvey could be struggling in 1@sx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I wonder why Hinden did not sit for it in the other room|pg||
nt|jtr: Taking some cash here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Perfect vulnerability to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: I wouldn't like to predict the outcome- Steel are probably slight favourites.|pg||
nt|patricck: Its an unusual situation, but West should have had enough confidence in what partner would need to make that bid. He should have passed 2@S|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: Yes i was thinking that before the Turkish element crept in|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|jallerton: in other room, rdbl showed 4+@h, dbl was support, showing 3 hearts|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It still seems normal to convert|pg||
nt|jallerton: I agree, I would have passed too|pg||
nt|jtr: It translates as "Special systems to improve" apparently|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you can make 3NT, they will go for a phone number|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: it's one of the reasons why you redouble in the first place|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, phone numbers used to be shorter|pg||
nt|jallerton: but this may only be 1 off in fact|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|hT|pg||
nt|iain sime: Yes, this is not agreat contract and could go down several.|pg||
nt|patricck: I'm thinking that North should have got a red card out for 4@C...  How likely is it that E/W could make anything at the 4 level when the clubs are clearly placed the way they are|pg||
nt|iain sime: Again it is interesting to speculate how many hearts NS would have made.|pg||
