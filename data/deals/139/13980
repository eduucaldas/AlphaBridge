nt|daman: no   you did not|pg||
nt|kit: you are right Sabine|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: but wait -- can't Zia discard his last club on fourth round of hearts?|pg||

mb|2C!|an|Majors|mb|2D|nt|jcmax: oh yes, indeed. so you were right after all :)|pg||
nt|ady: some danger of 6@D here    would go down unless cashing A@H on nothing|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|jcmax: But surely declarer would have gone up with the @CK :)|pg||
nt|daman: hopefully :)|pg||
nt|kit: North might have been more nasty with a 3@H call, holding such nice fitting cards in the majors.|pg||
nt|daman: the CC for NS says they play very weak overcalls|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: Or how about a lead directing 2@S considering that this very likely is their hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzgp: Yeap, NV 1NT is 4-12 at least 3 cards in all other suits|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: 2@S is too imaginative for me.  There is always the third opponent to worry about -- South might have a big hand.|pg||

mb|3H|nt|jaapfr: hoi Bas and all (was away)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzgp: Leaping Michaels openings? :)|pg||
nt|kit: Now we see what a he-man's preempt looks like.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: testosterone laden|pg||
nt|jcmax: Not an easy hand. At the other table s opened 1@C, W jumped to 3@S and N made a for me not obvious negative dbl to get to 3N|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jcmax: But it may be a matter of system. In the Fantoni-Nunes style 11C promises 14+ usually|pg||
nt|daman: South must be smiling at Zia|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Screens George :)|pg||
nt|daman: if they are on the same side|pg||
pc|h3|nt|daman: no  South and West|pg||

nt|daman: he will smile after the hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: lol, first headpoking at my table|pg||
nt|daman: :)|pg||
nt|daman: exactly|pg||
nt|kit: Welland showed some faith in partner leading a heart rather than a spade.  I don't know that I would have done the same.|pg||
nt|daman: can never lose a post mortem by leading partner's suit|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead  would make south uncomfortable   but with the 7-1 split would still prevail|pg||
nt|jcmax: So how will s play the @C suit now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Me neither Kit, especially not with @CK|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|kit: declarer has some problems here -- remember, 4 club tricks only gets him to 8 for sure.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|c4|nt|kit: and he knows Zia has 5-card heart suit for the preempt, so what else does Zia have?  Surely not 5-3-3-2.|pg||
nt|jcmax: If declarer misguesses 1C, it looks at first like there are only 8 trcks. but there is no communication between the defenders' hands, and in the end they will always have to give ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: declarer a 9th trick|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|kit: yes, but declarer doesn't know that|pg||
pc|h2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|jcmax: No, he doesn't. but in this case I don't think he needs to. he cannot avoid getting a 9th trick|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s3|nt|kit: agreed|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|s7|nt|daman: I think he has it figured out|pg||
nt|kit: unless he does this|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @HK and @S was down|pg||
nt|daman: double dummy|pg||
nt|kit: defense could have taken 5 tricks after heart play, but Zia didn't work that out.|pg||
nt|daman: not so easy at the table|pg||
nt|jaapfr: agree|pg||
nt|daman: http://tinyurl.com/2usolq5  for the tournament website with line-ups and convention cards. Dutch as well as English|pg||
nt|kit: now Zia won't get his king of hearts|pg||
nt|jcmax: Declarer now is worried, if he "misguesses" in @S the defence will have 2 @S tricks and the @H K|pg||
nt|jcmax: If he knew W had both @S honours he would claim at this point|pg||
nt|kit: it is inconceivable that Zia would be underleading queen of spades here, so going up king looks pretty clear.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|kit: or so it seems to me|pg||
nt|jcmax: But the thing is most people seem to feel nothing is inconceivable if Zia is doing it!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|daman: making 3    and on to the next|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: unless west overcalls, he thinks about it|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: that wont stop then|pg||
nt|lestergold: normal at fave|pg||
nt|lestergold: game is more profitable for N/S than penalty which needs to be 4 off|pg||

nt|kit: did North really overcall 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: At the other table 3NT went down when declarer played @H only very late, where it was very clear for N to go up with the A and shift to a @C|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|jcmax: An earlier @H play might have found N sleepy|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: If he doesn't go up with the @HA on the very 1st round then 3N makes|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2H|an|*|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: Even counting the @D finesse there are only 8 "obvious" tricks, so declarer has some work to do to find a 9th|pg||
nt|jaapfr: for specs : as we could tell before board 3 in CR was acording to movie 9 tricks unavoidable by discarding their 4th @C as NS|pg||
nt|kit: I think Zia showed 4-4 majors invitational.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jaapfr: but scoring is a bit unstable (Bas help:)?|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cT|pg||
nt|ady: only 8 obvious tricks including diamond finesse   but now the 7@C has appeared a 2nd club trick available|pg||
nt|kit: because it is safer, and even if the club lead hits gold that still won't defeat the contract outright.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|nt|daman: yes   and there is an inference E has the majors|pg||

nt|jcmax: To anyone suggesting @D was the unbid suit, the 1@C opening wasn't really natural. followed by the 1NT rebid it just showed a blanced hand and could have been a doubleton.|pg||
nt|kit: very unlikely doubleton club, since West doesn't have 4 of either major.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Love that system, with regular Walsh, and xyz in the subsequent auction|pg||
nt|daman: we so not have the cc for EW   so we assume 1@C is standard|pg||
nt|jcmax: Unless w were 3352 with 5@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: 1@C is 2+, but they don't have an actual cc|pg||

nt|han:  Hoi Marc, will join you tomorrow|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one small problem with a direct 5@C is that it severely limits the EW options, so, when you make that sort of jump, you had better be right  |pg||
nt|hedyg: but Meike did NOT want to go on|pg||
nt|pelu: if West like to go on - then I dont understand the pass from East|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|peachy: sry. Nunes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 5@d is makeable|pg||
nt|lestergold: however by  same token east cannot expect 5@d to be makeable|pg||
nt|lestergold: too many losers in his hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ralfwil: because of the @cK98|pg||

nt|han:  this may be a phantom but not an expensive one|pg||
nt|han:  seems normal to bid 5C|pg||
nt|pelu: but the basic problem is, that yhe atficial 2@C didn't tell 4 card @s - work fine if opp silent - but dont work so good when opp bid hard|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quite - NS have eleven clubs, quite reasonable to bid to 5@C|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Thunderstorm here now, so the system can go gown:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: so they count queens as 1/2 control?|pg||

mb|1H|nt|hedyg: 2@s showing a good raise in @d|pg||
nt|han:  2 only when exactly 4432|pg||
nt|hedyg: now double by E for takeout?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: she's thinking|pg||
nt|han:  and when balanced it must be 12-14 (or 11), with 18-19 they open 2D |pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't you just love hands like the North one - whatever happens, it will be your fault |pg||
mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: why not X ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i guess double is not takeout|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard to imagione what else it wold be|pg||

mb|2S|nt|peachy: perhaps Dbl now to show good overcall?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is already about a 5.5 loser hand. could grow old waiting for a better one|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: there was no alert on 2@C so Schollaardt asked and got 'cuebid'|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|hedyg: and at least 3 cards in each suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: yes, takeout/ish|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3@h can be made if  Fantoni guesses the heart|pg||
nt|hedyg: not if he has a ruff a @D in dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: not easy for him to justify finessing the heart as e/w subsided at 3@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: no way to stop Nunes, not even the 3 small @cs|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Fantoni glad he is no higher - but already too high|pg||
nt|han:  Fantoni bid well :)|pg||
nt|pelu: and 2@s is a winner - so no harm|pg||
nt|hedyg: how do you say in Italian: how many hcps do you think i have when everybody is bidding???|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|hedyg: also needs to get to hand for the finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: CAN DO THAT IN CLUBS|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once spades are supported he knows there is an entry to the N hand, and a red finesse rates to win|pg||
nt|han:  EW lead Rusinov from 4+ suits|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|lestergold: sorry caps lock hit|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW lead 3rd and low|pg||
nt|lestergold: however this will probably be defeated in practice|pg||
pc|s2|nt|han:  so king from AKxx but ace from AKx|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, but you can understand 3@H, even though you could say that South has bid his hand with double and the 2@C cue|pg||
nt|han:  2C showed his strength but not his 4 strong hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and you would hate to pass 2@s|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hedyg: creating an entry|pg||
nt|lestergold: east will know that and duck|pg||
nt|lestergold: in any case more to the point he is creating a discard fro the third diamond|pg||
nt|peachy: I think it does not matter if he ducks or takes, but duck can't hurt|pg||
nt|lestergold: may not be that easy for Muller to switch to a diamond away from his AQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: wonder why no @D switch by W|pg||
nt|peachy: I think by now he know his pd must have DK for the 2S bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: good popint hedy it would have made life a lot easier for defence|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1 spec suggests the translation is: Basta!!|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
nt|han:  although after the 1S bid, maybe it does show 4 hearts...|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|h3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|nt|hedyg: Muller has it under control|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he has corretly read that pard must hold the K@d|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|hedyg: good defense|pg||
pc|h8|nt|marlowepi: as i said, once spades are supported he knows N has a doubleton so there is at least one entry to N hand, and he doesnt have to worry about a 3-card heart suit any more|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so 3H is fairly clear NV in my opinion|pg||
nt|marlowepi: harder at MPs|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And it is only 50s|pg||
nt|han:  holding up by Schollaardt works well here, now the contract will go down 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: score bd 3 corrected..|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|hedyg: and corrected again :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another argument for 3H is that the fact that E did not double but instead bid 1S suggests he may have a heart void. since W has some values but did not bid 1H over the double, she ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is very unlikely to have 5 hearts. in that case, N would have five hearts|pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: what difference?  Will he really get doubled in 3@D?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jcmax: I guess it depends on how much partner expects for the 3@D bid|pg||
nt|daman: well   opp a decent hand   he could be volunteering -200 or -300 from thin air|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@S down 1 i think|pg||
nt|jcmax: many partnership have a rule like: you may never bid 3N with 18/19 bal or something like that|pg||
nt|kit: if you are going down 200, opponents can surely make at least a partial, probably a game, in a major.|pg||

pc|d4|nt|kit: The danger with bidding 3@D isn't what happens to 3@D, it is the third opponent who might take you seriously.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jcmax: E has to underlead his @D to get partner in for the @C ruff|pg||

nt|jcmax: Now on the toher hand EW can get both a @C and a @H ruff|pg||
nt|ady: yes   heart switch after clubs    can be down 2|pg||
nt|kit: On this deal, 3@D would have worked very well.  Not that I'm recommending it, but it is not at all unreasonable.|pg||

nt|lestergold: actually nothing really wrong done here by fantunes escept perhaps the defence tov 5@d but Zia Welland ion other room missing a vul game and a vul grand slam very expensive|pg||
nt|hedyg: on a @c switch he could still have made 5@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: not so easy|pg||
nt|hedyg: but possible and really not much choice|pg||
nt|lestergold: do u mean squeeze in blacks|pg||

pc|c2|nt|pelu: what to lead from S against 3NT - invitation in @h could give decl 9 tricks (as here) - some would from the S-hand lead an Honnor! |pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N is a very practical bid. it is LHO with the hand, so you want him on lead. and a heart lead is likely, in which case king makes over half the time, and even if N has it all you ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: need in dummy is Jxx ot stop the suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes it is a good idea to lead from the top against gambling 3N, but with a long suit and low spots that could be a disaster|pg||
pc|dA|nt|han:  instead of leading a small heart against 3NT, south might have led the heart ace... of course then it makes with an overtrick|pg||

pc|sT|nt|jaapfr: looks a misclick 3@D|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ady: this may be expensive|pg||
nt|kit: If North's double is a penalty double, which it is apparently, the overcall really costs.|pg||
nt|jcmax: Especially if the opponents know that a double in this situation is penalty. some don't play it that way.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @CA and x@H is rather DD specs|pg||
nt|kit: Not the best defense.  North failed to appreciate the threat of dummy's clubs.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcmax: There are questions regarding what else a double could be. some partnerships play that dbl shows a balanced invitation to game whereas 3@H would show a distributional invitation to ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: game|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s8|pc|sK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: N was probably hoping for S's @Ss to be better|pg||
nt|ady: A@C lead seems best    then time to make sure of 500|pg||
nt|jaapfr: -2 would be 24-25|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Though he would've played another @S honor the first trick|pg||

pc|c5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|kit: if he plays heart first, North just cashes spade|pg||
nt|kit: If he plays clubs he has to ruff fourth club to his hand, and again North gets a spade trick.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||

mb|1S!|mb|p|nt|han:  what will wortel do here?|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|han:  doesn't look like a 2s to me, vulnerable|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: a quick pass|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|hedyg: no way|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: e/w 3N easy 4@h may be unlucky with the minor suit Ks badly placed|pg||
nt|han:  and the suit is awfully bad for 2h|pg||
nt|han:  so I agree with pass|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|hedyg: 1@s is forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 2NT= 3@S 7-9 or 4@S 5-11|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT is 5+ with fit|pg||
nt|pelu: in red (spec) her hand is too weak to bid 2@s (Michael @h+!minor)|pg||
nt|han:  FN getting awfully high again|pg||
nt|mdgraham: personally I think Michaels cue-bids are much over-rated, but I'm just an old dinosaur  |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 12-15 NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for me pass is clear. not because of the penalty danger, but because opps have spades and have already announced them, so there is less to gain than to lose, because  meanwhile you ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: will have put youyr hand on the table face up|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Very dangerous, more likely to help opponents with the play in spades|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: 2@c was relay|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes that was my point|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s would force pd to bid on the 3 level with nothing|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|han:  lead seems automatic but not very effective here|pg||
nt|pelu: I like "Michael" but only on good hands where I exp that the hand belonges to us - "dont give information if opp likely get the contract"|pg||
nt|han:  I don't necesarily agree with that pelu, but 1H - 2H is very different from 1S - 2S|pg||
nt|han:  1H - 2H I would bid much more aggressively|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think that is too extreme. michaels mind find you an excellent save. but that is very unlikely here, and generally when vul and generally when their suit is spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, han you are making essentially same point i think|pg||
nt|han:  also, vulnerability makes a huge difference|pg||
nt|han:  but I think this hand at these colors is quite far away from a 2S bid.. for me|pg||
nt|han:  what now, heart to the queen?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|han:  he doesn't want to play trumps|pg||
nt|pelu: the "weak" Michael was very popular years ago - to most pairs play contructive Michael|pg||
nt|han:  he needs to get to dummy to take the diamond finesse, and then ruff two diamonds|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: same losers in NT as in 4@h|pg||
nt|peachy: this hand presents problems and minors are both sitting wrong|pg||
nt|hedyg: thus 3NT (9 tricks) was on|pg||
nt|han:  not most pairs I know pelu, but styles differ a lot|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: yes 4 losers thats the point|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||

pc|d5|pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzgq: muller played @H 10 not @H9, nunes probably looking for the ruff |pg||

mb|d|mb|3C|nt|cuttysark: "Cards" as they say|pg||

nt|kit: presumably West's 5@S call showed 1 or 4 keycards, not counting ace of hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/2usolq5  for the tournament website with line-ups and convention cards. Dutch as well as English|pg||
nt|ady: dont think you can hope to gain getting to 6@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: To prove my point: Welland: "I was unsure whether that was quantitative or not."|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: so Zia knew they were off one of the top 2 club honors.  Could have been the ace.|pg||

nt|lestergold: yet another 20/20 Roland favourite hand type|pg||
nt|desinka: hi|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The system is up again after the thunder|pg||
nt|hedyg: not on the switch?|pg||
nt|han:  actually< I thought they played 2/4 in the middle|pg||
nt|han:  correct|pg||
nt|han:  only 1st trick|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|han:  I think Schollaardt just played a club to the ace because the hand was over|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|lestergold: Hi Desita|pg||
nt|peachy: N might systemicly open 2S|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s making so 4@H -1 ok|pg||
nt|han:  that is my guess :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: good guess since he could not overruff dummy|pg||
mb|1H|nt|han:  1H by Fantoni?|pg||
mb|2H!|an|!S|nt|han:  2H shows 5+ spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, our famous principle once again:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes weak 1 level overcalls|pg||
nt|han:  either invitational with 6 oR GF with 5+|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|3C|nt|han:  2S would be weak with 6, Double would show 4-5 or constructive with 6|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s good @H raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|han:  now wortel knows about the massive club fit|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H?|pg||
mb|5H!|nt|desinka: 3@H still ok :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: re Ralf, welcome back :)|pg||
nt|pelu: what now: 5@h = void-wood><?|pg||
nt|han:  Wortel makes fun of me because I always want to bid exclusion blackwood|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Exclusion? - Zia tried the same bid|pg||
nt|han:  this hand will be good to remember|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Nunes suggests it shows a 7crd @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|han:  hmm, 5NT?|pg||
mb|6C|nt|lestergold: Dutch gain again|pg||
nt|peachy: conservative views have not gained in this match, not surprising|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think I missed a nice match:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: you did :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: but the next 1 is starting soon|pg||
nt|lestergold: Well you have 7 world class players and one quite good player in this match but good is not world class|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps the failure to raise spades can be explained that Fantoni cannot have 10HCP for not opening 2S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: only for Dutch spectators: dit lijkt de Hema wel :-)|pg||
nt|hedyg: all cards are friendly here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 5NT showing one key - West ignores the @HA |pg||
nt|han:  oh right|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure!|pg||
nt|pelu: if she dont temember - @cK is onside :)|pg||
nt|han:  I was rooting for 7 but exclusion makes it impossible. Wortel was right, bad convention!|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: although the EW CC says 14/30 rkcb :)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|han:  14/30 RKC but 0314 exclusion|pg||
nt|han:  "standard" among some|pg||
nt|hedyg: claiming|pg||
nt|pelu: when I have bidding-mistakes then the K every time if offside :(:(|pg||
mc|13|nt|hedyg: last board of this match now|pg||

nt|jcmax: too high in case partner has no aces.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next slam, 6@S by West|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S  can make e/w   |pg||
nt|kit: yes, but the more exceptions you put in your system the more likely that somebody will forget|pg||
mb|1H|mb|3H|an|minors|mb|p|nt|daman: gives them a chance to sharpen their slam bidding|pg||
nt|jcmax: This is a very good example of why 4-4 fits often play a trick better than 5-3 or even 6-3 fits. Playing in the 4-4 fits you have discards on your long suits and just have to hope ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: trumps break.|pg||
nt|kit: even without the interference, getting to 6@S on these cards would be very difficult.  With the interference, impossible.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Spades will likely be bid by East now and if they were in slam, Molenaar would double for the lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: Now spades are ruled out|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think East will bid spades here|pg||
mb|5D|nt|daman: Zia is bailing    he has few options available|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcmax: Also the @S contract would have to be played by W here because S can lead a @H for N to ruff|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|pc|d2|nt|kit: Seems like if South were planning on saving he should have done so immediately so opponents have less informtion.|pg||
nt|ady: 500  a save|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Maybe he was hoping for 4@D to buy it|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|jcmax: That is a very accepted strategy, Kit. But maybe S's delayed action in this case worked better for him?|pg||
nt|kit: This is not so easy for declarer, who needs to get to his hand for the club finesse.|pg||
nt|kit: he isn't out for 500 yet -- may have control problems.|pg||
nt|daman: do we think the double of 5@H was automatic?|pg||

nt|jcmax: But even if ha had done that, what could E have done when on play with the @CQ?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|kit: Then Zia leads heart when in with queen of clubs, and when Welland in with ace of clubs another heart and dummy is forced.|pg||
