mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2H|nt|knutte: wow|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I think you need a better hand, and first of all a better suit to bid 2@H|pg||
nt|knutte: totally agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzbv: E thinks 2@H is michaels, it seems|pg||
mb|3D|nt|knutte: saved|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  NS saved a lot of imps|pg||
nt|jbgood: so warned off, but 6 @s may we won|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  seems like N needed one more @s for 6 to be a solid contract|pg||
nt|jbgood: if you play for the diamonds to break they do, nicely|pg||
nt|knutte: difficult to find th spade-fit after this auction....|pg||
nt|andyv:  but how do you do that without allowing a @h ruff?|pg||

nt|vugraphzbv: they talking about the different explainations now|pg||
nt|vugraphzbv: TD called|pg||
nt|xenya: of course -- i think 2@H could well be interpreted as Michaels|pg||
nt|andyv:  how many partnerships discuss that sequence (and most use dbl or NT to show the other 2 suits).|pg||
nt|knutte: well, there shd be an agreement when u play this tournament, and 2 @H x is 800 I think?|pg||
nt|jbgood: sure - that is the normal thing|pg||
nt|Walddk3: What would double be? The blacks, right? And 2NT for that matter. So 2@H is best played as natural in my opinion|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I know Jon disagrees|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think NS didn't need protection on this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzbv: 2@h should be michaels, so W forgot the system and nothing more will happen about this|pg||
nt|jbgood: since it is so common to use Michael's in this position, I was sure pair who didnt had a clear understanding about that|pg||

nt|jaapfr: are EW female students:)?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Also part of the explanation why when it's not clear who owns the hand or who can make what, the 5 level belongs to the opponents.|pg||
nt|lestergold: why do i call you Frank it should be Rodal its psychological sorry|pg||
nt|jaheim: strange 6 sp with only K8xx in @S|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|sharkey: off 1 or 2?|pg||

mb|2D|nt|rodal f: Or a auto stop at 2@H?|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h should make |pg||
nt|rodal f: Looks as Ekrens 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: it is |pg||
nt|jaheim: but 9 tricks max|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - 8 to be exact - both ways|pg||
mb|3D|an|alerted|nt|sharkey: A rarity - a weak 2@D opener|pg||
nt|sharkey: the previous board was down 2 - not 1 - will be corrected|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Marshall Lewis|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hi all :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Must be prepared for all continuations -- here, 1@D and then 3@C and you feel much better than this.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@c seems a better contract ironically|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  now it's serious:)|pg||
nt|larsarthur: lowest 4-card is std in Norway|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Marshalll.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hagz: Hard to guess @s in 3 NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Just one thing left to do! Bid the 6er....|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually isnt 3n a trick short on a heart lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: A @D lead appears to be best for defence|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S had only 4 losers imo|pg||
nt|jcwla: Interesting to know but that doesn't begin and end the conversation for me in terms of how best to describe this hand.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk5: Running scores at  http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1074140R|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: there are arguments on both sides, but you aren;lt getting full value for money out of sputnik if you follow the same sequence with this S hand and also on   xx  AKx   xx  Axxxxx|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  on @s lead, can N still hold it down to only 4 losers?|pg||
nt|andyv:  without dbl dummying the @c suit?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any want to look at the pairs systemcards u find them here: http://www.nmlag.com/Systemkort til the turney is fin|pg||
nt|jcwla: When the clubs are significantly stronger or you will be able to handle all continuations, I have no problem with 1@C.  Here, a rebid problem such as this was reasonably likely.|pg||
nt|hagz: yeah, there is only one entrance the the dummy to get the @s tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This might have - regarding the bidding - about 7Â½ % chance to make|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: i suppose 2d sgowing i assume 4 spades might pick them|pg||

nt|rodal f: Will they try a new hard one NS?|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  too:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i dislike 2nt bid W|pg||
nt|andyv:  because of 3rd seat opener, S was not tempted to dbl opps into game|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree with u Mike. A invit would have been normal.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|rodal f: OK. So nice weather there two:) Welcome back home.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I don't mind it... W is a passed hand and can expect a bit better @c suit than pd put down|pg||
nt|jcwla: Pass seems normal on the actual hand, though reasonable intermediates and medium spots make it look not totally watered-down.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|marlowepi: once again it may be systemic, but i am not keen on the sequence chosen by E here. Even facing a PH, this E hand has significant game potential in a suit, so i would want to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maximize our opportunities to show suits|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 20 HCP and 4 card support for pard, e will be disappointed there is no Grand slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|sharkey: been here a while now - only leave during cold season...|pg||
nt|jaheim: Flått is prob thinking about the Q of @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: They picked up the cards wrong so Flått opened in 1 heart. All bids alerted after 1 heart.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s what I doÂ´nt like with 2 NT - how many @H has West - you never know|pg||

nt|marlowepi: the 3H bid...although with 11 losers and bad trumps it is still hard to bid 4S. if they dont have 2 ways to raise to 2S, N can hardly bid a game even though he has heart values|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@S by 10HP and 10X by often 6@Ss in S seems OK at me.|pg||

nt|rodal f: As Mike said.          The bid from W was 5@H over 3@H.|pg||
nt|lestergold: nol i said that south should have bid 5@h to take up space but having only bid 3@h west needed 5@h as unambiguous void showing and grand slam try|pg||

nt|rodal f: Some specs might wonder what 5@H would have ment.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|jcwla: That's not happening -- at least not as a result of forcing NT.|pg||

pc|c7|nt|andyv:  undertrick time|pg||
nt|jcwla: Unfortunately, much of the time it means "I have some shapely hand that doesn't have enough strength to bid at the 2 level."|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes it is fairly normal to bid 2S despite the poor holding and the good clubs--my point is that playing forcing NT really S has no idea of which black suit will be best|pg||
