nt|caitlin: here a useful void|pg||
mb|2D|nt|caitlin: must show other two suits|pg||
mb|4H|an|void|nt|yuval10: 3@s is @s and some @c support of course|pg||
nt|yuval10: a good lead directing |pg||
nt|desert: Hungary played in the Bonn Cup too.....so they have played 60+ boards for 3 and a half days now......not so easy if you are not a professional....|pg||
nt|jtr: They had a different team|pg||
nt|desert: oh... then forget what i just said :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: i am afraid they cant fix the liveticker|pg||
nt|jtr: 3NT can go a few down now  Yes great 3@s bid|pg||
nt|dimi: Olanski should bid a few hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|yuval10: now he'll correct to 5@c|pg||
nt|jtr: Correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: it is useful void even if 3 of East's 9 HCPs because East's @HK will never be a winner|pg||
nt|caitlin: especially now with bidding showing hearts and clubs by South|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|caitlin: East has nothing else to say|pg||
nt|dimi: EW will assume they are ahead, maybe Ginossar will not take the risk|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Or wait until he is doubled maybe?:)|pg||
nt|desert: excellent bidding by South...|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes, quite a good tactics actually|pg||
nt|jtr: That has stopped the @s lead anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: even if they're down 6 it's the same like 5@c X -2|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: S shows W his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: W : "tell me your lead"|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|yuval10: 5@d is 1 off of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: W/S agreed, that the bidding will be the same @@ all tables.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: N still thinking|pg||
nt|jtr: More quickly than 5@c|pg||
nt|desert: North might bid 6 Cl now......fearing that 5 Dia is a make....|pg||
nt|caitlin: he still has to find @DK|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|yuval10: can he find the @h switch afterwards?  not so easy|pg||

mb|2N|an|minors|mb|4C|nt|yuval10: 12 tricks are on with the @h finesse, but looks like NS will have enough if the able to bid game|pg||
mb|5C|nt|yuval10: i suggest 4@s from S now|pg||

pc|sK|nt|jtr: Maybe it was forced|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps, then why do you want to create a force with a hand like E?|pg||

nt|caitlin: hard to do void if 2NT is not strong|pg||
pc|h3|nt|caitlin: hard to do VUL|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jtr: So they can have rematches|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: i was asked yesterday, why the groups didnt become smaller|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jtr: 12 here|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: it is because of the number of teams: 50 only|pg||

nt|yuval10: but it's going to be very tough facing an opening W|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D|nt|jtr: a strong @c no less|pg||

nt|vugraphzkm: today 3 more rounds of swiss|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: last chance to qualify for group A|pg||
nt|jtr: Long day|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is problem with Michaels/Unusual NT......if you play real mini/maxi, North can X again over 4@S but can he with hand he held?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzkm: tomorrow group C will be cut to 10 teams, then there will be group D and E as well 10 teams each|pg||
nt|caitlin: perhaps he should with such concentrated HCP and void|pg||
mb|2C|mb|3D|nt|jtr: 50 is a neat number really|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Winkler wrote about XX : "as i remember any 1 suiter"|pg||
nt|jtr: Redouble?|pg||
nt|jtr: ah ok ty|pg||
mb|d|mb|5D|nt|caitlin: another option N has is to bid 4NT|pg||
nt|dimi: 6@s is on but @s was never mentioned so long|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|jtr: I would not have bid with North's cards but it is a matter of style i guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dimi: kibs told me also 6@c and 6@h is on|pg||
nt|caitlin: well they got to slam!!|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzkm: W opens the screen asking if he is right with his explanation|pg||
nt|dimi: well done|pg||
nt|caitlin: all of North's doing|pg||
nt|dimi: the need it urgently!|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
nt|caitlin: with X by South after a 3-level call|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|yuval10: so 2@d, 1@c and 1@h|pg||
nt|jtr: Anyway, 3@c will make whereas 2@s would not|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|caitlin: he can claim|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jtr: So maybe North's double didnt turn out well|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|cK|nt|caitlin: so folks this is last of German Bridge Trophy today on BBO as far as I know|pg||
