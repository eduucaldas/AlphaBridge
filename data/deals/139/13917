nt|h_karluk: slammish|pg||

mb|p|nt|desert: Good evening|pg||

nt|yuval10: probably P 1@s 2@h|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@d even|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: it could be that the score is not correct, because 21:14 is the score after 11 boards|pg||
nt|yuval10: P 1@d P 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  hello, Martin|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I am surprised that W passes in this position|pg||
nt|desert: the german pair at this table play a straightforward precision base with a 10-12 NT Nvul|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Rather than bid a competitive 3@S|pg||
nt|yuval10: she even|pg||
nt|pelu: its is not a light opening: 1@D = 9+ and 4 card|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|desert: Facing a 10-12 NT 3 Sp looks more risky :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: would've been better to overcall 1 as it turns out|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: hello and welcome|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Yes I thought it should have been bid and conveyed it.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, E had maximum and 4 cards fit - only 2 @s ? |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello Sveta, Mike and Bernard|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and to operator Lukas|pg||
nt|ludewig: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: we had technical problems, so we start in bbo with board 14|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if ddl was major/minor, would have expected 2@h if that was pass/coreect|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcarroll: Following the Law nonvul in particular I would bid 3@S|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sfoxa:  anyway, N has to be magician to bring this game home |pg||
pc|hA|nt|sfoxa:  Israel takes lead in his group, where France is 5th with big gap to second place (qualified for finals)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|s5|nt|h_karluk: classic nat sys isnt 12+?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: not "he" but "she", all women here at the table...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ladies around, ahem :)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: if you play these style tings, you have to work out your pass/correct bids, and work out which ones are natural  |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: only two to qualify?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|ludewig: I suppose X simply showed one minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: sorry sveta, but just the first in every group qualifies to the finals|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's a tough qualification|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  only one? sorry and thank you for correction|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|s8|nt|vugraphzkk: one final with 2x 12 boards|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if so, then only Israel and Russia have chances in this group|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: the rest is playing swiss system|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would choose pass as West, i don't think singleton @cK good enough, secondly i don't have 6 baggers|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Unless N follows the Rabbi's Law and drops the sigleton @C K this will be several off, and even so has only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|djneill: here, North had a choice between a takeout double of 1@c, and 1NT with a good doubleton|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|h_karluk: brown sticker?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sfoxa:  margin between them is big enough 104 - 121 as you can see here: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC_2010/10_05_12_dma.html|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3rdly i only have ugly 8 HCP|pg||

nt|djneill: should be a flat board, give or take a trick, no?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: th issue abt to bid what you see own hand, while you do not have an idea abt others holdings|pg||
nt|yuval10: np|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like a quite game here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the most important that they are not - undo is available for you|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: likely a part score for NS|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Agree.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|3S|nt|yuval10: that's some 3@s by E|pg||
nt|yuval10: now the way for a 4@s sacrifice is open|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sfoxa:  you can play as a Deep Finess all the boards - but what does it matters, if next door defenders apply DBL and allow overtricks... |pg||
mb|4S|nt|djneill: South does not play support XX to show 3 spades, but North will reveal the @d fit so it is moot|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they will probably end in 3@d|pg||
nt|yuval10: or maybe not...|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: The Ladies competition is much closer than the Open - 4 teams witin 5 VPs |pg||
nt|yuval10: S might try 2NT here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: perhaps everybody picked hard way, indeed rare and unusual|pg||
nt|ludewig: Could end in 2 Spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: some play here that over 2@d by North, if East doubles again, it shows "good @c raise"|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lead directing in "white" against red |pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: while 3@c is "bad @c raise"|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Anything beyond 2@C would be a minus score for EW.|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's more like it|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|sfoxa:  actually, not so dramatic. but somethings like this :-)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but unless S starts with 2N not comfortable for 3N|pg||
nt|ludewig: S has 6 losers|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perhaps 2@s by South at his third turn would show a stronger hand |pg||
nt|yuval10: in 4@h declarer need to guess the @h's which isn't so likely|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mcarroll: and as my partner says - in teams there is no such contract as 2NT it is either 1 or 3|pg||
nt|ludewig: most pairs pay this as stronger indeed and some tend to raise spades immediately with a weak hand and 3 cards|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  popular agreement indeed. but this time, S's hand isn't strong enough. must have 15-17, I suppose|pg||
nt|yuval10: after def. starts with 2@s's and a @s|pg||
nt|yuval10: @d even|pg||
pc|c8|nt|h_karluk: i ve no idea N bought tho knows 18-19 there, cannot see any extras or much cover cards|pg||
nt|yuval10: W will do best to duck it|pg||
nt|pelu: N hope for a 5 card @C by pd|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just a balanced 4423 with an Ace and 2 J|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c may be only a three-card suit - if \ West had a 4333 shape, for example|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and now declarer has to guess @s for -500 only|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh i forgot to add 2 tens, lol|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  this time 3NT is far better|pg||
pc|dK|nt|djneill: that's true, would be risky adventure to bid to 3-level vulnerable with 13-15 combined HCP|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|pelu: need "just" Hx in @cs by west|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: after this board i will make a short restart of bbo, because the scores are not transfered into the open-room :(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|s3|pc|h3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  np|pg||
nt|ludewig: West has everything under control|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|sfoxa:  his @s return followed by @c when in with @h ace will promote trump trick for defence|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d8|nt|djneill: West here would love to attack the long @c suit, but an unsupported Ace is a no-no at suits|pg||
pc|s5|pc|dJ|nt|ludewig: East shows Club entry with Spade 3|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and now drums beating|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we'll see what will appear from that empty hat|pg||
nt|pelu: the real chance was to play on @Cs - this plan only work if mistake by opp|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and teeth gnashing|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|djneill: so @h was the best of bad choices|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ludewig: and again with Club 8, standard carding as all French play it|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h9|pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: and, thanks to NS's abysmal failure to play Support Doubles, East has no idea how strong West is for 2@c  |pg||

nt|sfoxa:  this game is definitely better than 3nt, but with no "normal" chances, it seems|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d7|nt|riccho: brave decision by decl to finesse in @d immediately|pg||

nt|h_karluk: with 18? interesting, are we talking about von arnim?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still no game for either direction|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so raising to 3@c is rather risky |pg||
nt|djneill: yes support XX would allow an extra Pass option for West to show a v. bad hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, it all led to 3@d, as we thought|pg||
nt|yuval10: once again i should remind our viewers that the score might not be correct|pg||
nt|yuval10: Israel , as far as we saw , won the first session 29:14|pg||
mb|1C|nt|h_karluk: i would choose pass as W, tho 2 aces|pg||
nt|pelu: Yes - same start, but over !NT by N she passed with her 18 - remember that 1@C not naturel by Auken-von Arnim|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very tricky boards.|pg||
nt|yuval10: which is also approved by one of the players who's kibitzing here|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2S|nt|yuval10: so add 8 imps to Israel's score|pg||
mb|d|nt|mcarroll: but an interesting part score debate|pg||
mb|2N|nt|djneill: 2@d here is a R-M'ish transfer showing 5+@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@d=hearts, by the look of it|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: tough rebid problem|pg||

nt|djneill: borrowed from scandinavians no doubt|pg||
nt|djneill: wow, into the fire|pg||
mb|3N|nt|h_karluk: i guess both sides would try to dictate and finally agree abt 3N|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT might go down for some numbers here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: there are some partnerships in England - well, I can think of one - for whom almost every bid is a transfer  |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Hi again: by system EW open on 9+|pg||
nt|djneill: I have my mail sent next door and it gets transferred to me|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|nt|mcarroll: True Hamdi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I liked 2@s - 3@d would shows extras|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so am I|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *show|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sfoxa:  if after my 3@c partner bids 3NT - I feel uncomfortable|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would anybody here plays 2@s as last resort over 1@h?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sfoxa:  now is the other story. but hardly with happy-end|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sfoxa:  oh, I'm wrong - this time declarer prevails|pg||
nt|djneill: now we could have a promotion in @c |pg||
nt|djneill: North trying to work out whether going for ruffs will work better than giving a promotion (ruffing just once by North does nothing since it is a natural trick)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: regarding the previous board, it is often said that every convention comes with a price. Support (re)Doubles are all very well, but they do allow the opponents the option of ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bid/pass, as opposed to (as we saw) bid, of possibly indeterminate strength |pg||
nt|djneill: true|pg||
nt|djneill: so North could play a spade, ruff, @d, ruff, @c, promotion|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That is true and the agreement between partnerships foremost.|pg||
nt|djneill: but if North ruffs too much, now it is South's ruff that does not gain a trick :-)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. The Support route has the advantage of establishing the degree of fit early, which may well be important if the auction gets competitive.|pg||
nt|djneill: I have never tried to be much of a bidding theorist with geniuses above me doing the good work and testing, so if they play something, I play it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but by that time NS may have enough ruffs to defeat the contract |pg||
nt|djneill: since at IMPs the goal is to set the contract first, and get undertricks second, I think North is just imagining all the scenarios that matter, not this particular one (always ...|pg||
nt|djneill: down)|pg||
nt|djneill: for instance, East could have 3 @h|pg||
nt|djneill: South could have @cQJ and North may underlead the @cK :-(|pg||
nt|djneill: the unsupported Q lead is so rare, this might actually happen after a @s ruff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, it's hard to imagine in defence that the opposition are on a 5-1 fit|pg||
nt|djneill: South should deliver a @s ruff with a high @s for a high suit pref (@d)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS can cash lot of @h, but...|pg||
nt|yuval10: 7 tricks for declarer now|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk7: Israel has 8 IMPs more than shown on the scoreboard. Sorry, but we can't rectify that any longer|pg||
nt|Walddk7: We just have to keep it in mind|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I am sure Yuval can keep track :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 29-14 is the official score|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sfoxa:  even without @d continuation, N can take 9 tricks. now it's much more easier|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe the question could be in case 3@h rebid scenario would N decide to 3N or not|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes the @D continuation makes it easier|pg||
nt|djneill: the @s2 should be a singleton, no?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: for me yes.|pg||
nt|djneill: Poles would scoff|pg||
nt|djneill: I don't hear any scoffing|pg||
nt|po-s: if they play Polish he might have a doubleton|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|h_karluk: 2@s pretty much interesting call|pg||

nt|vugraphzkk: even I, as vugraph operator, I'm tired yet ;-)|pg||
nt|djneill: ok not a victory for the transfer, but West would have probably bid 2@h with that hand even without transfers|pg||
mb|p|nt|ludewig: Hi everyone again, now with scores from the Open Room|pg||
nt|djneill: ok, and on brd 2 in other room, South with 7 opposite a 15-18 NT used an invite sequence to get to game|pg||
mb|2S|nt|h_karluk: i believe you operator, however so far so good, woohoo, go go go , we need you@H :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  operator's job is much more complicated - you have noc chance to be "dummy" |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkk: thats right Sveta...|pg||

nt|vugraphzkk: i think, nothing problematic happens here...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  all new things are good forgotten old ones|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, it's not as though EW can make very much - the hands don't fit well|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: WBF rules i suppose|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mcarroll: In My opinion - and experience - the operator's job is the hardest, stuck between players who play either too fast or too slow, dont reveal their cards - when they make a mistake ...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: try to hide everything, and commentators who are asking for information you just dont have! |pg||
pc|s6|pc|d4|nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||

mb|4S|nt|h_karluk: 2D another special treatment|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so Multi defense could be th issue|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if it's Multy - i can adore such openings|pg||
nt|yuval10: the system works here, i think it's the 3rd hand that either E or W has 11 points and open|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now 25/15 there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: actually, no chance for 3NT, sorry - didn't see that North had five hearts|pg||

nt|mcarroll: the simple way is often the best way|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks to Peter provided excellent ideas to see their way|pg||
nt|h_karluk: agreed Martin|pg||
nt|djneill: with both major suit stoppers an issue, East bid 3@s to SHOW the stopper, and DENY the @h stopper, I guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: guess so|pg||
nt|yuval10: but they seem to have 4 losers|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sfoxa:  good reason for W to bid - he has values to add to each minor|pg||
pc|c5|nt|h_karluk: it's good to see new ideas in th laboratory|pg||
nt|ludewig: North might find heart queen after the bidding|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  side Ace-King - not so much for own play, but too much for defence. If partner decided to preempt - he will be surprised by the values |pg||
nt|h_karluk: this time NS lucky that S doesn't have 3 pieces spades - say E void in @s, would be funny|pg||
nt|mcarroll: For me it is a standard Multi|pg||
pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: 16 HCP in bag, say minimum 10 hcp overcall, then what, i liked her decision.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: Last match today in 1 hour and 5 minutes: Netherlands W vs Germany W|pg||

nt|h_karluk: still looking for a possible endplay, this one hard to see|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i think 1@h then spades would give better info <responder reverse>|pg||
nt|h_karluk: moreover could be an early fit on @h suit|pg||
nt|ludewig: of course|pg||
nt|mdgraham: likely heart lead will solve one problem|pg||
mb|4H|nt|h_karluk: this may upset |pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: and there it is...|pg||
nt|ludewig: I expect 11 tricks, losing 2 spades after a club ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: defense even|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  interesting question. @c ruff avoid you from taking 2 @s tricks, @s Q return prevent @c ruff (((|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: one step too far|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the problem there you can never know if there's 3 pieces @h support with that approach|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yuval10: so probably as you said, @c to the A follow by small @s, hopping declarer will put the K|pg||
nt|yuval10: but declarer should read it - with A@s E would've played @c ruff in 2nd trick|pg||
pc|cK|nt|h_karluk: bloody board, obv 5@c fails esp after @h K lead, surprised to lead and no double there|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@C = checkback-stayman|pg||
nt|h_karluk: or nmf|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@H = forcing 5-5 in major|pg||
pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: also your partner may recognize 5/4 very good |pg||
nt|h_karluk: for now  club pitch fine|pg||
nt|h_karluk: two way @h Q hook, problems abt entry to hand, not a happily 3N tho prsopects seems not much bleak|pg||
nt|mcarroll: or @H pitch|pg||
nt|pelu: difff lead for West - she know that S is 2-2-5-4 - but what to lead?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would rather save that @h|pg||
nt|pelu: @D for sure best for defense|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes excellent lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  why should he? althoug - let's see|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|djneill: this is a first-class commentator section, I will be coming around to collect the 1st class tickets from all kibs|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  and what about this position now?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  goes to 10, as it goes|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|yuval10: declarer didn't bite it|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|pelu: DD decl sh play on @Ss - and as I see that the best chance also if u only see 26 cards|pg||
nt|po-s: assuming there is a club ruff at all|pg||
nt|yuval10: if there's no so after the lead 10 tricks are easy|pg||
nt|po-s: I think an overtrick...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|h_karluk: now gave a chance to make it no matter @h or @s switch|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E has to be lazy enought to fail now|pg||

pc|sT|nt|h_karluk: http://www.expert.com.au/expert-articles/2008/4/9/lead-poisoning/ Sydney Morning Herald Wednesday April 9, 2008 Ron Klinger|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yuval10: indeed, small @s now must be the only choice|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@h losers say pitched one to @d, then how about 2nd?|pg||
nt|yuval10: that W have|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sfoxa:  actually, no - S needs club ruff at the table, so will play @s  ace|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ludewig: matchpoint decision|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sfoxa:  in teams - not so important|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|nt|h_karluk: home sweet home|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: and good try by the defense|pg||
mc|11|nt|vugraphzkk: first he ruffed the 3rd @s i think, it was too fast|pg||
pg||

nt|mdgraham: unlucky|pg||
nt|rnmalik: but for @H return by N would be -3, I think.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting board - 6@D has good play for NS|pg||
nt|djneill: I think they will find 6@d if East does not interfere|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6NT on the lie too|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  right. my personal record is winning 128-boards match by 1 imp|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|pelu: F1|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@D better who so ever plays-whereas N has to be the declarer at 6NT.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: of course, on this sort of hand, it is easy to lock into spades - let's see|pg||
nt|djneill: hmm, North's hand just improved, the @hK went from half a trick to a almost a full trick|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|h_karluk: I guess 2C invite or better on comp|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so over X classic sys on|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 1@h fake suit, maybe 1N different range|pg||
nt|h_karluk: wonder alert to 1@h also or not|pg||
nt|mcarroll: or maybe 1@D shows @Hs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be, saw similar samples|pg||
nt|pelu: would u bid 2@H? - @sK in front of opener - I would pass |pg||
nt|h_karluk: auto pass|pg||
nt|djneill: ah yes, it's slam time|pg||
nt|djneill: South is short in @c, where East has strength, so North's strength is not as much wasted as it could be|pg||
mb|3D|nt|h_karluk: 5 HCP, sorry partner|pg||
nt|pelu: almost only 2 Jacks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i dont wanna toss barriers|pg||
nt|ludewig: Lebensohl to 3@H, South likes it|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: this might be interesting|pg||
nt|yuval10: leading by 41 now|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ludewig: so this must have been invitational or even forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3@c doesn't improve North's hand though|pg||
nt|djneill: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: although he could bid 4@D. He has already shown spade support.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but still, this is a hard slam to get to.|pg||
nt|yuval10: even though it looks like Israel is putting this match away in a very quick rate|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|mcarroll: Interesting - esp with singleton @C A|pg||
nt|ludewig: probably 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h7|nt|h_karluk: short break by me, c u|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E's hand is worth an invite, but I'd prefer to hear 4@h from partner|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT from East was a winning bid|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|h_karluk: so half of natural half relays, i didnt see any difference except nat bidders would rebid 1N and S offers 2N then all pass|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ludewig: 4 diamonds, 3 Hearts and two black tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sfoxa:  yes, 10@s matters|pg||
nt|ludewig: but not clear to West which entry North has|pg||
nt|ludewig: if Clubs first he goes down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: even then has 11 tricks unless A@C is played.|pg||
nt|yuval10: as it seem like 4@s is going down|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ludewig: well done|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even now, @c return from S looks dangerous|pg||
nt|ludewig: If North had held both heart king and club ace, you need to play club imediately|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sfoxa:  does S consider to duck?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: here in this group it seems to be clear, that israel get on 1st place, but in th other group there are just 2 VP between the first and the 4th place now!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: the scores for everybody: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC_2010/10_05_12_dma.html|pg||
pc|hA|nt|djneill: if West has the @cQT there may be a squeeze for 12?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rnmalik: as it is peace prevails at 4@S.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c2|nt|pelu: board No 6 gave Netherland 8 IMPs - no opening in East (11 HCP and 5-4 in red). Then von Arnim open 2@S - and passed out?|pg||
