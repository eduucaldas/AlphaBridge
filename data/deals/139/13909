nt|Walddk3: TorO will probably tell you about board 17 now|pg||
nt|Walddk3: They are not going to play the hand as it is shown here|pg||
nt|vugraphzbv: the b17 they will be playing does not match the card you see here.. it has been redealt|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah i see|pg||
nt|jtr: So the bidding will not match the cards?  But that often happens anyway:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: The Førde boys had some really oddlooking actions and auctions in the first half. Hopefully we will see a better team this half|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbv: i can do the bidding, but i have no idea what cards they are holding|pg||

nt|jbgood: sry - I should inform you that this board has been redealt|pg||
nt|jbgood: so the cards on the sc re|pg||
nt|knutte: Nybo sits down|pg||
nt|jbgood: screen are not what they actually hold:)'|pg||
nt|knutte: Holding his cards in one hand....|pg||
nt|knutte: and maybe a glass og Bache-Gabrielsen (or some other good guy) in the other|pg||
nt|knutte: *of|pg||

nt|jbgood: I repeat: This last board has been redealt, so cards shown were not what the players had|pg||
nt|vugraphzbv: it was fortunatly a board of very little interest, S lead his Kxxxx and and had an entry for -1|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|knutte: so they have a few home-made things that works well most of the time :)|pg||

nt|jaapfr: are EW female students:)?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Also part of the explanation why when it's not clear who owns the hand or who can make what, the 5 level belongs to the opponents.|pg||
nt|lestergold: why do i call you Frank it should be Rodal its psychological sorry|pg||
nt|jaheim: strange 6 sp with only K8xx in @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: EW plays 5-5-4-2 and transfers after 1cl openings|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|sharkey: off 1 or 2?|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
mb|1S|an|alerted|nt|jaheim: another @S contract,  better trumph this time  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Or a auto stop at 2@H?|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h should make |pg||
nt|rodal f: Looks as Ekrens 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: it is |pg||
nt|jaheim: but 9 tricks max|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - 8 to be exact - both ways|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sharkey: A rarity - a weak 2@D opener|pg||
nt|sharkey: the previous board was down 2 - not 1 - will be corrected|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to find A@c and Q@c lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: good vuln save|pg||
nt|andyv:  down at least 500|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx Torstein:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes they may stretch too far on this one too|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: This contract is playable by a dobble hook in @C|pg||
nt|hagz: 3 NT makes, 6 @c makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: looks reasonable - unless the 4-1 @H break becomes a problem|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here is a good example of a hand that natural bidders should open 1@D.|pg||
nt|larsarthur: south is not sure about @dfit|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Marshall Lewis|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hi all :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Must be prepared for all continuations -- here, 1@D and then 3@C and you feel much better than this.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@c seems a better contract ironically|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  now it's serious:)|pg||
nt|larsarthur: lowest 4-card is std in Norway|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Marshalll.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hagz: Hard to guess @s in 3 NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Just one thing left to do! Bid the 6er....|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually isnt 3n a trick short on a heart lead?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharkey: A @D lead appears to be best for defence|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S had only 4 losers imo|pg||
nt|jcwla: Interesting to know but that doesn't begin and end the conversation for me in terms of how best to describe this hand.|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are arguments on both sides, but you aren;lt getting full value for money out of sputnik if you follow the same sequence with this S hand and also on   xx  AKx   xx  Axxxxx|pg||
nt|james_h: tricky rebid in normal systems for south, no such difficulty here 1@s must be 5?|pg||
nt|rv: 1@s possibly shows 5@s here|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi folks!|pg||
nt|geot: Hi friends:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 1 spade was not forcing|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Andres, wlc|pg||
nt|james_h: Hi Geo|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  on @s lead, can N still hold it down to only 4 losers?|pg||
nt|andyv:  without dbl dummying the @c suit?|pg||
nt|james_h: Hi Anders|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rodal f: If any want to look at the pairs systemcards u find them here: http://www.nmlag.com/Systemkort til the turney is fin|pg||
nt|jcwla: When the clubs are significantly stronger or you will be able to handle all continuations, I have no problem with 1@C.  Here, a rebid problem such as this was reasonably likely.|pg||
nt|hagz: yeah, there is only one entrance the the dummy to get the @s tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This might have - regarding the bidding - about 7Â½ % chance to make|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: i suppose 2d sgowing i assume 4 spades might pick them|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant be done really |pg||
nt|hagz: Can't get them|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to make a decision as to how to tackle the diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: can play i suppose to ruff 2 hearts in dummy|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you ask then too much|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||

nt|geot: Hi guys. Lets hope Førde can fight back a bit in this secon half of the match. What they were able to show in the first half was unfortunately not their usual level at all |pg||

nt|geot: sure. We have all been there:)|pg||
nt|andersk: lets see if Hjelmeland can male this|pg||
nt|andersk: make|pg||
nt|rv: declarer needs to take @s finesse, if he plays @s from top, 4-1 break might scuttle the contract|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|sharkey: Not many use weak 2@D opener - I believe it sometimes is very effective|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway -500 not too bad for NS:)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|andyv:  true|pg||
nt|andyv:  vs. 550:)|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|lestergold: cant go wrong as cards lie|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
nt|jcwla: On Board 1, 5@D was doubled in the OR and made on the lead of the @CT.|pg||

nt|jbgood: a very interesting question is if it is worth trying something out of the ordinary when you are struggling. I think not, this is a round robin, so every VP counts|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Here a weak two from South might work|pg||
nt|jaheim: Slam EW|pg||
nt|Walddk5: How is your team doing, Anders? Can they afford to bench you? :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Multi|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H very likely may be the final contract here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think N wud be very ambisious to look for more - 4333 and 12 HCP|pg||
nt|rodal f: I belive W will reopen and end in 3@D?|pg||
nt|andersk: They can afford it, for sure:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  ok, I'm blind... where did the @d loser go?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: S hand a reasonable opening at these colors|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will they try a new hard one NS?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nope.|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie e/w has more play for 4@s than n/s has for 4@h in spite of the hcp distribution in n/s favour|pg||
nt|lestergold: north passing i assume a strong nt holding a 9 count??|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it happens its a winning decision|pg||
nt|rodal f: The NT use to be 15-17 but can be 14 at there CC.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well must be something like that but there is serious risk of missing a game|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Pd needs the perfect hand to make game; according to Hamman he never has...|pg||
nt|rodal f: CC servedagain for NS: http://www.nmlag.com/var/fckeditor/nmlag/file/2010/Singsas/Systemkort%20Kare%20og%20Jan%20Emil.pdf|pg||
nt|jaheim: Shoudnt be difficult to bid and play|pg||
nt|andersk: I have not played my best bridge, not as bad as the butler(My feeling) but totaly ok to sit over and take a break|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sharkey: N will raise|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree there.|pg||
nt|larsarthur: conservative pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: trow in N and in double renonce extra trick so 5 was sure|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @C @S @D @D and 11 tr|pg||
nt|andyv:  right...11 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  you dbl with S hand 2N here?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rodal f: Still in US Carl?|pg||
nt|sharkey: since 3@D makes gain 1 imp|pg||
nt|rv: my personal belief is if you are down by any margin (large or small), it is best to play as accurately as possible and hope for luck and opps to make mistakes, playing against odds ...|pg||
nt|rv: is not correct strategy ever:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: a scary bidding board|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jaapfr: -200 or even -300 to punish W for his 2nt bd|pg||
nt|andyv:  I like when I raise my partner's suit and he/she finds another suit to lead.|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all sorry I am late |pg||
nt|andyv:  never to late, Shirley:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi Shirley|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: no - sunny Stavanger :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect if D were Kxx and clubs KQxx, he would have been more likely to open|pg||
mb|3N|nt|larsarthur: probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  too:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i dislike 2nt bid W|pg||
nt|andyv:  because of 3rd seat opener, S was not tempted to dbl opps into game|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree with u Mike. A invit would have been normal.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: OK. So nice weather there two:) Welcome back home.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I don't mind it... W is a passed hand and can expect a bit better @c suit than pd put down|pg||
nt|jcwla: Pass seems normal on the actual hand, though reasonable intermediates and medium spots make it look not totally watered-down.|pg||
nt|andersk: still 4 matches to go, and a long way to go, so medal is still possible if we improve!|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I second that; I have been in that position too often for comfort|pg||
pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: once again it may be systemic, but i am not keen on the sequence chosen by E here. Even facing a PH, this E hand has significant game potential in a suit, so i would want to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maximize our opportunities to show suits|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 20 HCP and 4 card support for pard, e will be disappointed there is no Grand slam|pg||
nt|james_h: I do sometimes do in the last segment of the Bermuda Bowl when 16+ behind|pg||
nt|rv: @C lead and @d switch required to beat this which is double dummy defebse|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|sharkey: been here a while now - only leave during cold season...|pg||
nt|jaheim: Flått is prob thinking about the Q of @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: They picked up the cards wrong so Flått opened in 1 heart. All bids alerted after 1 heart.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s what I doÂ´nt like with 2 NT - how many @H has West - you never know|pg||
nt|rv: normal @d lead should result in 10 tricks|pg||
nt|andersk: When all 5 players have been under pari, it is not easy. The easy part is that we cant blame any but ouhrselves:)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|rv: Anders, are the top Norwegian pairs like Helgemo-Helness, Grotheim-Tundal, Brogeland-pd playing this event?|pg||

nt|vugraphzkn: N diddent see pds 1nt opening|pg||
nt|andersk: top 8 club teams, this year:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I think e/w will try 4 @S here at the end of the day |pg||
nt|jaapfr: still   Studentenes sounds very female to me but do not master Norwegian|pg||
nt|andyv:  S took a far more aggressive stance on board 1 and found the excellent save of 5@d for 9 imp gain|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR|pg||
nt|rv: so quality of bridge on display should definitely be of high standard|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: On Board 1 Studentenes have picked up 11 IMPs - not 10.  6@S at this table was off 2.  This will be corrected|pg||
nt|rodal f: By his 9HP Forfot ain't fare away for a normalopening.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: Shud be some action here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3@C some kind of mixed raise?|pg||

nt|rodal f: So by the screens N are same blind I am witout screens?:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah that explains |pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: funny faces in here :-)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sharkey: So far NS have not been able to introduce their @D suit - may be too late now|pg||
nt|sybarra: or will E venture 3 nt at some point |pg||
nt|andyv:  actually N deserves the credit for dbling 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
mb|3D|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|andersk: we also have another team event plaing like a premier leuage, two 2. divisjons 8 3. divisjons etc, premier leuage is the top team event, this is the top club team event|pg||
nt|rv: do EW play standard or a limited system?|pg||
nt|james_h: Any kibs have outline system info?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 5-5-4-2 with transfers after 1cl openings|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lestergold: south cannot make anything at the 3 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Kib informs 3@C asks for strength and suit quality|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6!@S probably down 1 although 5@S likely to be +1|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharkey: 3 NT shows max|pg||
nt|rodal f: U have the funniest any way Torstein:) I will come to Ålesund tomorrow non. Will be nice to see u again.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkn: NS precision club|pg||
nt|andersk: normally there are 5-8 very good teams in this team final, some years the level is not abselout top|pg||
nt|geot: The nightmare for Førde seems to continue. The 4@S North went down in here (board 18) was played in 4@H at the other table, won by Cantona Nybo. 13 impsmore|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|sharkey: so wise of NS to stay out of the bidding as appears 5@D x wud be off 800|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jaapfr: good leading technique|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: par contract is 5@d for EW though 4@s makes as well|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like PA is trying to play 4@S |pg||
mb|5C|nt|geot: In 5@D you have to guess the trumps|pg||
nt|james_h: another reason to take the normal line|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  W's 5@s bid asked for what?|pg||
nt|andyv:  club control or trump?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @S support i say|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi:) Normaly trumh cuality.|pg||
nt|andyv:  if so, then 6@s was optomistic by E|pg||
nt|rodal f: quality*|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even wrong bid E|pg||
nt|rv: how many brds per round, we seem to have started off with a huge score in favor or Namsos BK?|pg||
mb|p|an|alerted|nt|jcwla: Will we get a failing @H finesse?|pg||
nt|geot: 16 boards|pg||
nt|andersk: 16 a round  32 a match|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: apparently systemic to open 1H on the W hand|pg||
mb|5D|nt|larsarthur: how can it fail?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: i predict 10 tricks - probably wrong again....|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: better claim down 1 to make dummy not too ashamed:)|pg||
nt|rv: East will pass and West will bid 5@d to deny first round control|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: So easy for us, seeing all cards.....to play the trumps without a loser. Not that easy at the table|pg||
nt|james_h: indeed|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|rv: if cue bid is doubled by opps, redouble shows first round control, bidding another suit shows cue in that suit and promises second round control of suit|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if the EW carding is to be believed, the heart queen is with E|pg||
nt|andersk: might get the @D right now, since N doubled 5@C|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: Mildly said. E is Erlend Skjetne fro the Norwegian Junior team older.|pg||

nt|rodal f: At board 2 EW went surpricing -1 at 3@D and 6IMP for the Students from Trondheim.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E would not respond 1S on a balanced 4-count vulnerab;le|pg||

nt|andersk: I think it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: EAfter East's 4@S west will not move towards slam; perhaps a little "heavy" non-vul|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think many players would have opted for 1@S instead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Which major du you lead?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rodal f: Many use sidecolor at jacoby in Norway.|pg||
nt|rodal f: I belive 4@H would have been the best bid from Boge. |pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  must be showing a major minor here|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Stop the E/W wagon, I want to get off|pg||
nt|rv: once partner doesn't super-accept your transfer, you would tend to pass with 8 hcp and invite only with 9 on 5332 or 5422 shape|pg||
nt|james_h: 4s easier in practice|pg||
nt|andersk: Førde again trying to get back by bidding too much|pg||

nt|james_h: I tend to go with all 9 hcp except flat with no 10's and 9's|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: You as many others would have done I belive. It's only a @C lead that keep them of 12 tricks.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  I see more of an advantage for DONT in direct seat... in pass out seat, something simpler might be better|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|sybarra: I often play a system in direct seat and natural in pass out seat (or landy only) |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|james_h: North is going through more mental anguish|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sharkey: Even with @C lead I believe slam makes as @D set up|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South was end-played in the lead - only one of three could beat 3 NT|pg||

nt|vugraphzkn: 2 nt was stenberg|pg||

nt|h_karluk: I guess as long as we agreed we can load many meanings to any bidding, ie look that very nice pair, i sometimes see them in regionals The Gravonotters. I m also a strict fan of ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: their column. They've many special treatments, absolutely not classic|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has a choice oer 1S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Best idea is to claim - |pg||
nt|rv: one of the reasons K/O matches are preferred in final stages of ACBL and World events is because of this strategy of teams not doing well playing anti-percentage bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Multi|pg||
nt|marlowepi: american tendency is 2C then double|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sharkey: I believe Grand BK is one of the country's oldest bridge clubs with lots of traditions|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: p/c 2H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: p/c=pass correct|pg||

nt|sharkey: Slam on a finesse|pg||
nt|rodal f: But will get 2 aces away by 4NT.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: useful for NS to play transfers in this situation|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  agree, Hamdi... that's what makes this game so fascinating|pg||
nt|sybarra: N can be pretty sure it is no spades in S hand |pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: But a interestin @C contract EW.|pg||
nt|rv: in Round Robin, teams not doing well can really upset the field by not playing seriously|pg||

nt|andersk: unbalanced GF|pg||
nt|james_h: 3?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|andyv:  W not elated with the dbl|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The defence to the Multi Two Diamonds is fundamentally different from the defence to a weak two for a number of reasons: |pg||
nt|andyv:  2N leb?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then can raise to 2S in two different ways, distinguishing pure obstruction from some genuine values|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: The direct defender always gets two opportunities to bid. |pg||
nt|jaheim: Strong cl NS|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|andyv:  looks like it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The 4th seat defender usually gets two opportunities to bid.|pg||
nt|andersk: Maybe they dont play 2 NT as unbalanced GF|pg||
nt|rv: anyone for transfers on 1m-1n?|pg||
nt|james_h: I prefer 2n to 2@h|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharkey: Our excellent operator, Torstein Hesseberg, informs me the club is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year - also followed by a big tournement this fall|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not shure there|pg||
nt|larsarthur: 1 or 2 imp back to vikersund|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: The defence do not know opener's hand type immediately. |pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems so now. When 3@H came|pg||
nt|andyv:  looking for 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 2 nt 3 cl 3h should be alerted|pg||
nt|h_karluk: So does that make defending against the multi 2? easier or more difficult than against a weak two? In my opinion there's no problem  as long as you are sensible about it. ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Basically, assume that the 2D opener has a weak 2H/S hand. |pg||
nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx Torstein:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: :-)|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would expect most to double.  Meanwhile, this seems somewhat meek.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|h_karluk: There are numerous variations of the multi 2D, so let's assume a fairly basic one (weak major; strong minor or strong balanced). The suggested defence does not really change if ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there are other possibilities such as 4441 distributions  assume a weak opener. |pg||
nt|andyv:  like all systems...after a while a decent defense or multiple defenses are found and then we wait for the newest development.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: this is my laste Geir will now join |pg||
nt|lestergold: well both n/s stretching their values here |pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: bye all see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|rv: if Ringseth's had a stiff major, he could have jumped to 3M to show stiff and long @DS|pg||
nt|rv: unfortunately 3@c on 1@d-1n shows both minors and 18+hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: ht lead looks likely and no play|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 4th seat  Assuming RHO bids a weak 2d |pg||
nt|andyv:  nice acution|pg||
nt|jaheim: and a coffeebreak|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: bye Torstien|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Now things are different, LHO and RHO are both weak|pg||
nt|sybarra: that 9 of @S in dummy is a big card |pg||
nt|james_h: another find the lady hand|pg||
nt|rv: in any case it is best to play some science, either transfers or artificial 2n response as suggested by Anders|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|h_karluk: you can freely bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: as is the club holding |pg||
nt|andyv:  but will be difficult to find Q@d unless following the Crane rule:)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: the 3H bid...although with 11 losers and bad trumps it is still hard to bid 4S. if they dont have 2 ways to raise to 2S, N can hardly bid a game even though he has heart values|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@S by 10HP and 10X by often 6@Ss in S seems OK at me.|pg||
