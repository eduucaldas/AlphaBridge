nt|xenya: i would have though a @C return was easy, considering E had led a small club |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ady: £@C from east  should show an honor   normally would plau 2nd best from nothing|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1@s = GF relay|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: 3@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam possible but not probable here!?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|rhelle: 2@h = relay|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|rhelle: 3@c = 2-5-4-2 exactly|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@H may be possible to reach|pg||
nt|rhelle: they will in all likelihoof end up in 6@h now|pg||
nt|xenya: they will get there |pg||
nt|april7: y, since an ace and Q of @S is missing|pg||
nt|roswolf: can they find out about these features?|pg||
nt|rhelle: the missing Ace is in @cs - missing the @dAce would be better|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, South is thinking what the best route is|pg||
nt|xenya: will take them 10 minutes and 5 more rounds of bidding|pg||
nt|rhelle: he now has 2 options - a weak and a strong relay|pg||
nt|roswolf: is there a danger they might bid the grand, i wonder!?|pg||
nt|rhelle: both will show 5 controls, after which he can look for specific features|pg||
nt|xenya: hardly|pg||
nt|rhelle: no, North will show nothing in @c|pg||
nt|xenya: i wouldn't bet on them bidding 7 here|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah thanks rob - which all goes to show science has its uses|pg||
nt|rhelle: my prediction is 3@d, as the @sQ, @hAQ and @cA is enough for 7|pg||
nt|rhelle: so he'll look for controls and then feature cards|pg||
nt|april7: 3@H might ask now for @H honours and then 5@D as exclusion BW|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4@C =?|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|rhelle: 4@c = 5 controls|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: TY|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4@D = FEATURES?|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4NT = honours in @h and @d, and denies the @sQ|pg||
nt|rhelle: 5@c asks further, and 5@d denies to top @c honour|pg||
nt|roswolf: so he now knows no @CA?|pg||
nt|rhelle: not yet - in a sec|pg||
nt|april7: odd bidding in CR , why is 4@H in CR forcing?|pg||
nt|rhelle: North can still have the @h Ace, @dK and @c Ace|pg||
nt|xenya: he needs to know about the @HQ?|pg||
nt|xenya: S i mean|pg||
mb|5C!|mb|p|mb|5D!|mb|p|nt|rhelle: now he'll bid 6H - can't stop in 5@h anymore. Unless he bids 5@s, or course - but that would be wussy :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: can he find out about the @HQ?|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, but it's pointless. He knows the @cAce is missing, so it's never more than small slam|pg||
mb|5H!|mb|p|nt|rhelle: 6@c shows a 2nd top @h and @d honour|pg||
mb|6C!|mb|p|nt|rhelle: so he can safely bid 6@h|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: I guess that without the @hQ he'd bid 6@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: EFFECTIVELY THEY HAVE BID DOUBLE DUMMY - IMPRESSIVE|pg||
nt|roswolf: and i meant the caps!!!!!|pg||
nt|rhelle: as the chance of finding the trump Q in @s is greater with 9 than with 8 trumps :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rhelle: gotta go for a while - enjoy!|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re geoffrey and all ga|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Heya Jaap, wb to the show|pg||

nt|ady: hi|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re bas|pg||
nt|roswolf: the real lesson for all of us is learn your system thoroughly and then concentrate in applying it especially in slam auctions|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: One of the grands bid and made last session by Wijsmuller was bid in three rounds :)|pg||
nt|ady: anything happening|pg||
nt|xenya: that doesn't happen to them very often, but on that particular hand their system allowed them to find out everything they needed to know very quickly  |pg||
nt|april7: N doesn't know how to continue, but evrything works|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it iis quite lucky in that respect|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|hK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: if the bidding on that hand is considered quick   what is slow   10 minutes to bid a hand?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|april7: if @H are 4-1 , contract is in dange|pg||

nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: need a bit more than that to muck this one up|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS play ice-relay precision|pg||
nt|lestergold: south is close to bidding 6@h now without further messing about|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: (n)Ice|pg||
nt|lestergold: may explore for 7|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL Gary|pg||
nt|lestergold: no reason for north not to hold A@c|pg||
nt|sybarra: is there an exclusion (of @D) bid he can make?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Everyone is back|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kiwibridge: re Bob and good luck with mice|pg||
nt|hedyg: like 5@H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Thanks|pg||
nt|hedyg: we have seen it before today|pg||
nt|lestergold: a void showing diamond bid now would not excite north too much|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry 5@d of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@d quite enuf|pg||
nt|sybarra: was clearly before I got out of bed,  its only 714a here now |pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@d i meant|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2N xfer to @C?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@d by S|pg||
nt|lestergold: go back shirley much too early for u|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d not void|pg||
nt|sybarra: early person here,  this is "late start" for me |pg||
nt|lestergold: what do u thinkl 4@d would mean then|pg||
nt|sybarra: forcing |pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c = atrificial gf|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@d too much spade taken up|pg||
nt|lestergold: south wants to give north space to cue club if he has it|pg||
nt|hedyg: aces is all he wants to know|pg||
nt|lestergold: no which aces and of course q @h too is what he wants to know|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no, specific ones|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: our operator is Bob Lucassen, hoi Bob!|pg||
nt|hedyg: so bid 5@d exclusion|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kiwibridge: or pass :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bob undo?|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is this pass about?|pg||
nt|sybarra: now can bid 4 @D? |pg||
nt|hedyg: you mean what is the 2NT about ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: and then the 3@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n merely abouy miscjief|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: I think n/s in forcing auction,  so just a matter of seeing how far e/w want to hang themselves|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: This should be correct|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont srr what 3@h is meant to mean|pg||

mb|3S|nt|mich-b: 2NT showed the rounded suits here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2N =  @C + @H|pg||
nt|mich-b: and 3@D was probably an invite in @Hs|pg||
nt|lestergold: only 5 card suit not that great a suit either|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|hedyg: http://tinyurl.com/2usolq5  for the tournament website with line-ups and convention cards|pg||

nt|sybarra: the cue Jonsson did not want to hear |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now he knows no A@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: right|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so 6@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: for the specs,  we cue "up the line" |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: im  told that 4@d means 4 controls|pg||
nt|sybarra: so ace of clubs cue would be first responsibility |pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H?|pg||
mb|5C|nt|hedyg: really 4@H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: must be some relay here|pg||
nt|sybarra: Mike has the key here it seems|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Really, yes.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the problem is we are not that au fait witgh n/s bidding system|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: so he could well have the A@C!|pg||
nt|hedyg: how can he show 4 controls?|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|hedyg: K@d is 1 control, the 2 aces are 2 each, that makes 5|pg||
nt|lestergold: could 5@c be asking about club control?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I have their 7 pages of supplimentary notes on how they deal with 1 level overcalls :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/netherlands/brink-drijver.pdf|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL oh good!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not much help here though|pg||
nt|hedyg: what puzzles me is the 2NT bid|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: mudd ying waters probably|pg||
mb|6C|nt|kiwibridge: be E transferring to @C I guessed|pg||
nt|sybarra: think no puzzle, just messing about |pg||
mb|p|nt|mich-b: but East did not have a comfortable way back into the auction|pg||
nt|mich-b: and refused to try a balancing double, because his @CK is working only in defense|pg||
nt|hedyg: would a nice Dutch guy do that?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or as Gary says|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmmmmmmmmmm...  I think so!!!|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am with Gary on this|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time NS are relaying|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: these guys have such complicated systems,  with notes stretching over 250 pages  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: I'm told 2N = weak @D raise|pg||
nt|hedyg: ahhhhhhhhh ty|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I think there were several wasted rounds of bidding there :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: well they got there|pg||
nt|sybarra: and that approach suggests  (esp. white) E felt they were not going to get Killed |pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: but good for vugraph |pg||
nt|hedyg: how did you like the 2@d bid ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and now... the lead that enables the early claim|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|sybarra: my pard is passed hand, how serious can my interference be?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|sybarra: have other bids to "be serious" |pg||
nt|hedyg: i think it is more like : they are in gf, please lead @d pd|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@S showing @D would have been more exciting|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: now has to rely on spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: but as we can see all hands all lines make|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mich-b: East should not ruff now|pg||
nt|mich-b: he would be ruffing a loser , of course|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c4|pg||
nt|hedyg: he didnt expect this?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: now 2 rounds of trumps then if both follow no prob if spades dont break|pg||

nt|ady: 4 level maximum both ways    can be difficult judgement |pg||
mb|2N!|mb|4S|nt|jaapfr: any idea 2nt is?|pg||
nt|roswolf: it is up to the TD's to keep them up to speed (perhaps chess clocks could be used0 - if they were fined imps for every minute for being late as in time faults in show jumping - it ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: would soon speed up|pg||
nt|april7: par contract is 5@H, 1 down|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room, E opened 4@S, S overcalled 5@H, then after 2 passes E bid 5@S -- that doesn't look consistent to me |pg||
nt|ady: 11th trick for n/s unlucky   both important minor suit cards badly placed|pg||

nt|lestergold: west may phantom at this vul|pg||
nt|lestergold: take insurance|pg||
nt|sybarra: and "insurance" may lead to opps going to 5 level |pg||
mb|p|nt|mich-b: of course the traditional approach is not to preempt with a side 4 card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|mich-b: A "disciplined" action by Drijver - not opening 3@C , like some players would do , convinced by the vulnerability|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly thatb sort of hand|pg||
mb|5S|nt|lestergold: i would consider 5@s off one a normal result on hand altho it isnt par|pg||

nt|sybarra: LOL |pg||
pc|h3|nt|mich-b: East knows that East will not have 4 card @S support|pg||
nt|hedyg: the balancing double by Fantoni allowed E to bid again and get to play in his 7 card suit|pg||
nt|mich-b: he would raise to 2@S with that rather than pass|pg||
nt|mich-b: so he prefers the 7 card suit , to the 4-3 fit|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
nt|hedyg: tricky lead!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kiwibridge: those @C's are only useful as trumps|pg||
nt|hedyg: for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: @cs 3-2, @ss on side..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Fantunes play what are called Slavinsky leads very tricky|pg||
nt|hedyg: and they only underlead aces when it is right :p|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: of course|pg||
nt|mich-b: best for he defense is to stay passive, and let declarer work on the @S suit himself|pg||
nt|hedyg: E surely has a singleton @H or void, the question is where is the 10@H (for Fantoni)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not normally this slow when defending a part score|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni? LOL|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: even he|pg||

nt|hedyg: but can he be doubling here for -1?|pg||
nt|hedyg: isn't that very dangerous?|pg||
nt|lestergold: depends which heart nour played first|pg||
nt|lestergold: honour|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: when 60 down, might you think of more?|pg||
nt|hedyg: doubleton*|pg||
nt|lestergold: could have shown a good 5@d bid by first bidding 4n then correcting 5@c to dims but i dont think north would have bid 6 even then |pg||
pc|hA|nt|mich-b: but getting 1100 here will be almost as good perhaps|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you believe other room 6@C bid?|pg||
nt|mich-b: note Fantoni's pass , on the strength of his @H10|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|hedyg: S is definitely too good for a 3@c bid and how else to get to 6@c?|pg||
nt|hedyg: would that not have shown 2 places to play ?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|hedyg: in a good hand|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|mich-b: no, i dont think other room will reach 6@C , but thats not impossible|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you rite -1100 more likely|pg||
nt|mich-b: the way to get to 6@C , is for South to double, North to show values via Lebensohl, and South to complete the description by bidding @Cs , going past 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: need to remove the @c ruff|pg||
nt|hedyg: for most players 2NT would be weak|pg||
nt|hedyg: (lebensohl)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: quess @HJ or @S9|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni knows that Nunes does not have the J@s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @DJ mb too DD|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they'll be pushing to finish before the next scheduled start time|pg||
nt|hedyg: so playing @s is not tempting|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kiwibridge: "a card"|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not too DD for fantoni:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: at first yes but the second bid would have corrected taht impression|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could still have 4+@s and long @ds|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|hedyg: went all the way to dummy to play K@D?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: may as well go light now|pg||
nt|lestergold: With 4 spades and 5+ dims he would bid 4@s not risking the 5 level|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Missed it again, I'm very sorry.|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok np|pg||
nt|hedyg: Mike he could have a better hand with @s and @d and not want to just bid 4@s?|pg||
mc|12|nt|hedyg: now J@H|pg||
nt|jaapfr: would love to hear his thinking analysis in these both tricks:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: if they play @s to ace and a @D back he can ruff and play K@C since S surely has A@c and no more @hs|pg||
nt|lestergold: possible but more important to use the 4n bid in the manner i described that standard bidding to show good dims|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3@d???|pg||
nt|hedyg: is this a transfer?|pg||

pc|s3|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||

nt|lc: He is probably thinking : "If @S run, down anyway, so let me make sure not to throw away a minor."|pg||
nt|lc: For example, a @D discard would be disastrous if declarer had @DAKQxx.|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose a @C discard is unlikely to hurt in most layouts.|pg||
nt|pelu: can W signal in "hs that he like the @S-lead?|pg||

nt|lc: I suppose having a 2nd space could mean liking them.|pg||
