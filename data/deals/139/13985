nt|Walddk2: Weissmuller won a gold medal and was the 1st person to break 1 minute for 100 metres|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Now they can do it 9 seconds:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think any textbook recommends that you play in 5NT. It's an impossible contract to be in, really|pg||
nt|jtr: Walter Johnson tells us that 2@c was not GF|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jtr: So he thinks 3@s was a sign off|pg||

pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: The order of boards in the Netherlands is unique: 15, 16, 14, 2, 3, 1. Can confuse anyone|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||

mb|p|nt|mich-b: A "disciplined" action by Drijver - not opening 3@C , like some players would do , convinced by the vulnerability|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: Bob pls undo|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass by south is missing|pg||
nt|mich-b: but some "modern" players , tend to ignore this advice|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think he didnt want to preempt his partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Apologies|pg||
nt|hedyg: E did not open 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: np Bob :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: but it is still wrong|pg||

mb|d|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d9|nt|mich-b: East knows that East will not have 4 card @S support|pg||
nt|hedyg: the balancing double by Fantoni allowed E to bid again and get to play in his 7 card suit|pg||
nt|mich-b: he would raise to 2@S with that rather than pass|pg||
nt|mich-b: so he prefers the 7 card suit , to the 4-3 fit|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: tricky lead!|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: those @C's are only useful as trumps|pg||
nt|hedyg: for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: @cs 3-2, @ss on side..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Fantunes play what are called Slavinsky leads very tricky|pg||
nt|hedyg: and they only underlead aces when it is right :p|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: of course|pg||
nt|mich-b: best for he defense is to stay passive, and let declarer work on the @S suit himself|pg||
nt|hedyg: E surely has a singleton @H or void, the question is where is the 10@H (for Fantoni)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not normally this slow when defending a part score|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni? LOL|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: even he|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|jtr: Look at Fantoni's overcall!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nunes must have been quite optimistic when he doubled 4@S. His partner even overcalled at the 2-level!|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I'd rather not|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|jtr: Yes, you ave the au pair to gaze upon|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|chessmaste: Slightly surprising there was no blue card in the other room|pg||
nt|jtr: Respect|pg||
nt|rhelle: without the double 4@s is in trouble ... % play is to duck a round of @s, in case North has a singleton honour|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you can't beat 4@S with that trump holding after your partner overcalls at the 2-level, it may be a good idea to consider if bridge is the right game for you|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Or your partner....|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: Muller may take a shot at 5 :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If you dont double 5@S with that trump holding you should consider a different game:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Although they play a natural system, i have less idea about E/W's bidding than N/S's|pg||
nt|Walddk2: After all, you are also on lead against 5NT should they pull|pg||
nt|rhelle: he's thinking if they have another place to run to ... and if they did, would partner lead @s?|pg||
nt|jtr: They cant run to 3NT|pg||
mb|d|mb|5N|nt|jtr: But Welland tried|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I don't think EW have much of a system. Did Bas not tell us last night that they don't even have a convention card?|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|nt|Vugraphzgp: They've got two sheets of paper lining out some agreements, but no cc indeed|pg||
nt|jtr: Welland using the principle that you never pass with 3-card support|pg||

pc|h2|nt|Vugraphzgp: Again, Welland apologises, only this time before putting down dummy :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know our commentators and Bas know, so please don't reply, but for other specs this question. The N-S system is named Tarzan Club. How did it get that name?|pg||
