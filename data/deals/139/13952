mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: this is surely favourite to make..|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|wilkinsona: so sound bidding to 3NT this hand..|pg||
nt|iain sime: On a heart lead this makes six clubs and three aces. |pg||
nt|patricck: But why would you lead a heart on this auction?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Going back to totally old fashioned methods then 2@S is best --after all it is not a race |pg||

pc|hK|nt|garnetts: On this hand I would rather chew my own arm off than bid opposite a passed partner|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: here, having seen Clive's 2 heart bid on an earlier hand, perhaps 3 spades a pushy bid|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|lilac9: four hearts is not a piece of cake |pg||
mb|2D|nt|iain sime: Yes, a @D was led at the other table. Once in a while East will bid 3NT without a diamond stop and you pay off. |pg||
nt|garnetts: 1NT to protect maybe |pg||
nt|patricck: a little too thin for me|pg||
nt|lark20: esp vul|pg||

nt|garnetts: partner could have somewhat more than they have |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes but 1 diamond may not be the best EW contract|pg||
nt|patricck: you might have some 10s and 9s and have some honours in your 4 card suit tho|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk1: The team names are reversed on the scoreboard I'm afraid. No way we can change that now, has to wait until the second stanza. Iain, could you keep track, please?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: if you reopen and oppo bid & make 4 hearts, not so good|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree about 1@D not being the best contract when maybe partner has 4/5 and is fixed--but then you might miss a game |pg||

pc|cK|nt|jcwla: W has the @S length so needs some reason to put W on @C length also.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|iain sime: Clive ran the heart to his jack trusting Les Steel to have led an honest card- can be a dangerous course as many of us have found to our cost over the years.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and some players open 1 d with a strong distribtional hand thinking "this will not be passed out"|pg||
nt|garnetts: You have a better case over 1@C |pg||

nt|iain sime: I think, if playing 12/14 1NT, I would have rebid 2NT with this 17 count.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: as spec says club switch needed|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|yr: gulzar tries to "swing" with an unorthodox lead|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|wilkinsona: seems right, though intervention aided the auction elsewhere|pg||
nt|patricck: yes a 5 card suit with the109 in the long suit make it a hefty hand to be valued at just 15-17|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: all the same 3N far from cold it seems|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have to admit on the last hand I forgot partner had passed already so I agree 1@S is not best |pg||

nt|wilkinsona: anyway well done by Owen and match almost square|pg||
nt|garnetts: sad when you have found a really good lead too |pg||
nt|patricck: strong @C auction in the OR seems to have missed the NS @S fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: yep 6 rounds to 3 diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|yr: i think we can safely congragulate Data steel now|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not much to recommend the strong club then if you miss a good contract |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|wilkinsona: quicker route to a diamond contract here|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would have thought that strong clubber could manage a spade contract |pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|jallerton: the 1Nt response to 1D in the other room worked better|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: should do|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jtr: Distributional take out double|pg||
mb|p|nt|yr: this wil be a small pickup for solox though, but it only reduces the margin|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jallerton: 3@s is a bit rich opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very Italian|pg||
nt|jtr: And 3@s is a bit exhuberant facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|jtr: Touche Jeffrey|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: perhaps West felt his partner might actually have something |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|iain sime: But not for long as Bif and Derek have lost 800 on Board 16.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jtr: I suppose he might guess the @s|pg||
nt|jallerton: He has played with Martin before!|pg||
nt|jtr: Placing the Ace with South|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: perhaps not, as they lost 800 in 4 spades doubled...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: a hidden spade suit in a NT opener..|pg||
nt|galadriel: Disciplined pas by N should ensure NS don't get too high|pg||
pc|c6|nt|garnetts: maybe say 1@C   1@D  2@D  2@S -cannot see much wrong with that start |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: David are you part of the avant guard that responds 1 spade on the south hand?|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes |pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jallerton: yes, after @dK lead and @D10, low from South|pg||
nt|jtr: Indeed|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, I thought NS might regret not doubling 4C. Very frustrating to beat the oppontns 4 tricks vulnerable and lose on the board (board 16)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: when I was off air, there was talk of 4 hearts on 15, but when this was tried oppo accurately lead trumps to scupper that|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcwla: Yeah, it's more of an overcall (or as here a responding hand).|pg||
nt|galadriel: When John Holland opened the N hand, his partner nearly got excited :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jtr: Getting the @h count|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jtr: Not that it seems to help much|pg||
pc|d6|nt|garnetts: I also probably pass 2@H though |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jallerton: why is that important?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|yr: it has been a professional performance by data steel, but lets not forget the amazing fightback that solox have staged to reach the final|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jtr: He is trying to eliminate|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s5|pc|h8|pg||

pc|d4|pc|s6|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jallerton: @dQ now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: TGR's running scores round 8, halftime: de Botton vs Dhondy 53-13 ; Scerri vs LNWers 51-13; OMC vs TGRs 9-13 ;Teltscher vs Cardtossers 47-14|pg||

nt|jallerton: same in most midweek leagues round the country, which are usually played at people's houses|pg||
nt|patricck: Indeed it was a good contract, but with @H 3-0 the defence really wasn't too difficult to beat it|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|patricck: meanwhile this looks like a push result. 4@S a reasonable contract but needed some of the trumps onside|pg||
nt|iain sime: This is an unlucky 4@S bid in both rooms. So Steel has an 11 imp lead (scores reversed on scoresheet). |pg||

nt|jallerton: *of|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|jtr: Did well to stop, sort of, at the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: @H and a minor|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I assume all balanced hands are opened 1@C by the N-S pair in the closed room|pg||
nt|patricck: certainly frisky, even at the vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: yes, it's a shame South opened a non-systemic 1@C|pg||
nt|patricck: N/S can do very well in hearts, but difficult to know which one of them was supposed to enter the auction|pg||
nt|iain sime: North South have missed a decent 4@H here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Oh, is it|pg||
nt|galadriel: A bit West of Falkirk - Kilsyth|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: East is her husband Charles|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: trump lead sort of marked here|pg||
nt|jtr: Some open 1@c on any balanced hand|pg||
nt|jtr: But not this pair it seems?|pg||
nt|jallerton: no, both N/S pairs systemically open 1@D with 4|pg||
nt|jtr: My style too|pg||
nt|jallerton: at this stable, East seems to have bid some of North's hand|pg||
nt|patricck: 3 rounds of trumps stops 4@H I think|pg||
nt|iain sime: It looks like that means only five hearts and four tricks in the minors, but wheer there is nine a tenth often appears.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure, but having done it and struck gold, passing 3 clubs fails to put the pressure on|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have always thought that the sort of intervention by west is well worth the risk--I suspect the problem is that East did not bid enough--anyone for 3NT and not 3@C |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: declrer may read this lead as a singleton|pg||
nt|patricck: Going up with the A@H will make declarer's task a lot harder|pg||
nt|garnetts: This has all the hallmarks of playing badly if it is a singleton--so probably worth the risk it isn't|pg||
nt|patricck: But can he really play low? I wouldn't have thought so|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: north taking his time..as well he might as the lines are not clear|pg||
pc|sK|nt|garnetts: I think it is worth the risk |pg||
nt|patricck: well done|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: Pros and cons. The advantage of opening 1@C on 2+ is that 1@D is 5+ unless 4441|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Beryl Campbell|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi Beryl|pg||
nt|lark20: Hi all|pg||
nt|patricck: Welcome Beryl :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jallerton: "transferred king" with an opponent is a new concept|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|sQ|nt|iain sime: Bidding 4@H might have stampeded East into 5@C minus one. |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jtr: Makes a change, he usually bids both opponents cards|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: North is Derick Sanders from Edinburgh|pg||

nt|paulg:  Steel and Walker have done little wrong in this set and they may be disappointed to only have a small lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|vugraphzgt: 1@c = at least 2 playing 5-cd M|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulg:  Last board of this set and I'd like to thank Fiona, our excellent operator, Peter Lund, Roland Wald and Ian Crorie for their comments|pg||
nt|paulg:  Also the Scottish Bridge Union and the team at the Carlton Bridge Centre in Edinburgh for this broadcast|pg||

nt|idc: On the hand where he had to find the @hQ, I noticed Charles Outred sneakily pitched one from Q9xx|pg||

nt|Walddk2: How is your Turksih, David?|pg||
nt|jtr: Evet|pg||
nt|iain sime: Les Steel is Scotland's best known player with over fifty caps. |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: declarer relieved to negotiate that I should think|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I have been taken to task for using first names...|pg||
nt|galadriel: is Vi also claiming ber?|pg||
nt|galadriel: beer?|pg||
nt|jcwla: E hand very good but when W did not control bid E stopped at game.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but at least they dont usually change do they Anne?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: benimkiler asla oyle yapmaz.ozel sistemler gelistirmisler   try this I got from a spec just now|pg||
nt|iain sime: Dave Walker has played on Scottish teams with a variety of partners in the last twenty or so years.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: pressure still on as slam time comes|pg||
nt|galadriel: No, only second ones :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|patricck: an excellent slam, not really good enough odds to bid the grand slam, although it does happen to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxx: this board is upside down, so Hallberg has South hand|pg||
nt|lark20: Can they find the club slam?|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: I think so--West has a great hand for clubs and should know it|pg||
mb|p|nt|lilac9: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzks: welcome |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 1 club is either strong or a weak NT|pg||
nt|galadriel: Think there must have been a X from S|pg||
nt|jcwla: First names change more out here in Hollywood.|pg||
nt|galadriel: Did S X Stephen?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|iain sime: John Holland is a current English international from Manchhester. Clive owen is also English from Darlington.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: arrangements after a reverse come in to play|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anne must be right - and as so many hands it's a race to 1NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: sry - yes|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jtr: Hmmm  Struggling with that|pg||
nt|galadriel: Ok :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|garnetts: That is in my view a dreadful bid |pg||
nt|lark20: Oh dear!|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|lilac9: 3c here looks like a good limit raise in hearts|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...in these situations the club suit is back in the pack..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, I believe Vi 's second name started as Mitchell|pg||
nt|jcwla: The 1@H a transfer to @S's?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: yes|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jtr: It must be western Turkish i think|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jallerton: Garvey could be struggling in 1@sx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I wonder why Hinden did not sit for it in the other room|pg||
nt|jtr: Taking some cash here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Perfect vulnerability to pass|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|iain sime: I wouldn't like to predict the outcome- Steel are probably slight favourites.|pg||
nt|patricck: Its an unusual situation, but West should have had enough confidence in what partner would need to make that bid. He should have passed 2@S|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|wilkinsona: there must be a forcing way of showing support|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jtr: Yes i was thinking that before the Turkish element crept in|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|garnetts: 2@S first is perhaps best after 2@D--then say east bids 3NT which likely shows a 5-4-2-2 hand then 4@C seems right|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jallerton: in other room, rdbl showed 4+@h, dbl was support, showing 3 hearts|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: Yes, and ... ?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: It still seems normal to convert|pg||
nt|jallerton: I agree, I would have passed too|pg||
nt|jtr: It translates as "Special systems to improve" apparently|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you can make 3NT, they will go for a phone number|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lark20: Holland couldn't have done any more.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's one of the reasons why you redouble in the first place|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, phone numbers used to be shorter|pg||
nt|jallerton: but this may only be 1 off in fact|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT is just awful--maybe say the same hand in the majots with xxx and xx in the minors|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|iain sime: Yes, this is not agreat contract and could go down several.|pg||
nt|patricck: I'm thinking that North should have got a red card out for 4@C...  How likely is it that E/W could make anything at the 4 level when the clubs are clearly placed the way they are|pg||
nt|iain sime: Again it is interesting to speculate how many hearts NS would have made.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|lilac9: slick defense here|pg||
nt|lilac9: declarer saves the day by playing another trump|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||
