pc|hA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S play needed to make 4@S|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Sveta|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this agreement gains popularity - if after partner's opening 1nt responder doesn't see more prospects than a game, he bids 4@c (or 4@d) with both majors|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  4@c shows better @h, while 4@d emphasizes @s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Here with 5/5 S had a good bid.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and minimum info for the opps|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||

nt|peachy: he may of course not know it:)|pg||

nt|s bech: East bidding suggests Jacoby. well, we might get to see these 1D openings. they seem to be rather common. Lucky for E/W howeber to get away with 200 |pg||
mb|2D|an|4+hcp|nt|chick: I also considered that, and neither N nor S had an obvious lead, but I can't imagine them actually bidding it|pg||
nt|pbundy: despite the distribution, 3@C would be my call here, too.  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: Polish 1C opening is usually something like this 12-14 HCP, balanced (usually without 4 diamonds) or 4=4=1=4; 15+ HCP with a real club suit;18+ HCP with any shape|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The main problem with the Swedish 1C opening is the lack of flexibility: the "strong" hand types have to take a second bid (or else risk not showing their strength), which does not ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: work well if those hands are not pure two-bid hands. |pg||
nt|chick: this could be bad if EW end in 3N |pg||

nt|chick: 3@C for me also, longer suit|pg||
nt|pbundy: our 1st major swing.  n/s reached 3 NT in the other room - and made it - when their counterparts got too high in 5@S|pg||
nt|chick: and now 3@S is cheap to bid|pg||
nt|chick: when you can identify a double-fit against a double-fit, it's important to win the contract ... very risky for a double game swing.|pg||

nt|rnmalik: a trick short on @S lead.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but here declarer has only 8 tricks after @s start and careful discards|pg||

nt|chick: this is not quite that situation, but players should consider it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Polish Club is slightly better in this respect since it is a more conservative system. In Swedish Club, the strong hands typically start at 17 HCP, whereas Polish Club requires ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: about one point more than that.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: This may not sound like much of a difference, but it does tend to make the strong types a little more pure.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 4-1 seems to be the normal trump break for NS|pg||
nt|mr murray: not going to make. many cards offside for declarer|pg||
nt|mr murray: and bad trump break|pg||
nt|bridge_one: interesting this overcall in 4 cards majors with a long minor out|pg||
nt|mr murray: one kibbitzer says 5 diamonds a make|pg||
nt|bridge_one: similar at overcall of 1Nt (polish style) with 4Maj and 5+minor, but giving the suit over 1@c strong (here, playing 2 way, is less effective)|pg||

nt|pbundy: 3@S could be making - along with 3@H.........|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Agreed|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, partnerships need to discuss the difference between pass and 3@S here by E.  One possible understanding is that when pd's cuebid has forced us to a certain level (here, ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@S), bidding it directly shows the weakest hand - and anything else, even passing, shows at least a modicum of game interest.|pg||
nt|yuval10: but as Meckstroth said - those "little"  imps adds quickly|pg||
nt|ziff:  Good decision by N/S, anyway|pg||

nt|jcwla: Wow -- W must have seen some of E's o/c's.|pg||
nt|yuval10: if declarer try to play @h to hand he can suffer 2@d ruffs and go down ( 2@h, 1@c, 2@d )|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as S over 1S, double would make me uneasy. but so would 2C. just goes to show that awful overcalls in spades can still do damage to the opps even at the one level. but without ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: shape they usually do more damage to our side|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, did 2N promise 4S?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, it's not beautiful, esp with a void in pd's suit -- but can retreat to @C's comfortably b/c has 4@H's.  The one thing you don't want to do that you sometimes see newer ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: players do is make this negative double with just the @C -- pd will never stop putting you on @H's.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Don't know, maybe not - my comment above based on the perhaps faulty premise it was a @S raise.|pg||
nt|yuval10: Erev Tov Roland :)  all is well, great to see you here|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: hýzlý 4@h dese þimdi 4@s gelirdi..yavaþ olunca zor|pg||
nt|chick: exactly the same principle I meant about the double-fit hands|pg||
nt|nobbe: 6@H looks most resonable contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: interesting club spots, too|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: 1@h might actually have been natural|pg||
nt|chick: in any case, they arrived at the best spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: North has shown minimum and 6331|pg||
nt|daman: the made 6@H in the OR on Board 2 so a big, fat 17 IMPs to San Sac|pg||
nt|chick: the opps showed their clubs to each other rather than the spades, but in any case, did not lead the !A|pg||
nt|mrdct: this is quite a good layout for declarer despite the 4\2 break|pg||
nt|yuval10: after @d lead declarer will probably play A@h and @h towards hand|pg||
nt|s bech: 2H= 11-13 bal with 4c sup in hearts. |pg||
nt|friggi: what does 3H mean?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: did I say unlucky.... ment very lucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomek: Gierul nie skontrowal nawet 3@H|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|chick: @DA*|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very surprising play|pg||
nt|chick: I'm sure it was a spade raise, showing a good hand.  E's pass over 3@D says the rest -- no interest in competing|pg||
nt|jcwla: Even if not, the principle applies to situations where pd has made a conventional raise forcing us to a particular level.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: holding three dead hearts, W probably viewd the negative double as a danger sign when LHO did not bid hearts. also the overcall perhaps is sometimes made on 4 cards. and as u say, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has probably seen the likes of this E hand and perhaps worse:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Right but need partnership agreement -- many pairs play the exact opposite: pass below the level of our force shows some interest.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Back in a flash.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes i never doubted that 2N showed spade support. my question was whether it promised four of them|pg||
nt|yuval10: why didn't S lead a @d ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think N should ask himself that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also, that question was not addressed to the principle you were stating Jordan. I was simply looking for reasons why W did not force to game|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cuttysark: Probably a similar defence to what they play over 1NT - to save memory strain|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@d are ON, of course, so the overcall worked very well|pg||
nt|yuval10: you can say Erev tov to Ida as well...she'll understand u well|pg||

nt|chick: well, credit to them finding a contract that has a chance|pg||
nt|affe82:  without interference that downside is negliable though.|pg||
nt|yuval10: E must bid 6@s now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: Shalom Roland|pg||

nt|yuval10: he already discounted it with 4@s|pg||

nt|mr murray: if opener was an American "naturale" diamond n/s dont buy the hand so easily|pg||
nt|cuttysark: True - the overcall made it impossible for Wset to bid diamonds on his own|pg||

nt|yuval10: well bided|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chick: still, no excuse not to pull his partners double with a 6-5 black hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The natural option of the 1C opening bid contains hands of 15-17 HCP which are almost certainly not pure two-bid hands, and so these can be a problem.|pg||

nt|bridge_one: E/W make a easy 5@h - it is important (in IMP competition overall) to call game, because if opps make 4@S you wil lose too much - better a little risk (5@H-1 vs 4@s-1) that a game ...|pg||

nt|mr murray: I could simpathize with dbl of 4 spades which turns out bad but pass should be out of question|pg||

nt|jcwla: Anyone prefer X to 1@H?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very dangerous to pass in N seat|pg||
nt|marlowepi: important to open 1D|pg||
nt|chick: trusting pard to have 4 spades, I think N can afford a 3@S bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for sure|pg||
nt|chick: the double should also show at least 3 diamonds (in theory)|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: This is most likely some form of Stenberg ... 3@C showing a club fragment and a non-minimum hand|pg||
nt|haans: easy to bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: close|pg||
nt|ziff:  Not exactly without risk to open that 12 count with a singleton @S in fouth hand, either|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, then no reason why not to bid with a double-fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: has to be 4 spades, no way S should be encouraging N to compete against hearts without 4 spades when both are PHs|pg||
nt|friggi: I do not think that he @D suit in N can justify an opening|pg||

nt|marlowepi: that might be an overbod...couldnt W have 6HCP?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N had passed in 3rd seat at favorable and had already shown up with a ton of HCP. it had to be S with the @HQ|pg||

nt|h_karluk: and Sven-Olof Flodquist.|pg||
nt|chick: 1N 17-19 I suspect, so W declines the invitation|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@d means 4+@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: right on Liz|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed it does - best to laugh about it and move on|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@d was @d and major i persume|pg||
nt|haans: 4 Ts is a lot|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is not about shape, but about HCP, N was marked with 1o HCP already|pg||
nt|ziff:  Unless he held @CQ, which was more or less imposible after @CA play|pg||
mb|p|nt|kamyk: taka pochwa³a oczywistego wistu (na niedogran¹ koñcówkê) to próba uzyskania psychicznej przewagi na stole - nie jest to szczyt elegancji|pg||

nt|yuval10: i think 4@h is too much from W|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, he has already shown something close to this|pg||
nt|yuval10: P already warned you that all his values are in @s and you have XXX @c|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right, and the defense marked N with KY of D also|pg||
nt|marlowepi: KJ|pg||
nt|friggi: S should be the dec in 7@D:)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: KQ behind the one who showed @H yes clubs seems natural to lead|pg||

nt|mlodygda83: a tymczasem Auguri w 6 zagra³o 6|pg||
nt|xenya: in particular, i don't quite understand W's 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: switch ten and 7 of spades and i think there would be a guard squeeze for 6N without a spade lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: yep and persumably N would've opened with 12 points and 4 @s's|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes that was my point. probably any 12 points but for sure with 4S which were known about|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 7@D is 4 off|pg||
nt|friggi: yes|pg||
nt|s bech: unlucky for E/W that N gets a chance to lead club if they reach, But that might not be the only lead she´s thinking about.|pg||
nt|arvidsson: onless a club lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2uj293f  running scores|pg||

nt|tomek: 3-cia dama kier pod nozem daje szanse na wygranie|pg||
nt|peachy: difficult to follow a completely artificial auction|pg||
nt|yuval10: the players here played all day long and fatigue probably takes its toll|pg||

nt|pbundy: certainly very conservative|pg||

nt|tez: @h asý @c lerin arasýna koymuþum..@c as zannettim ortak mý dedin:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe there is one still with spade jack lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: OR has already finished while we have 5 more boards to go|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ah no, cant get to E hand to lead heart to ten without burning an entry|pg||
pc|cA|nt|atalok: muhtemel artý 1 olacak|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: w rozdaniu 7|pg||
nt|zbig1959: akcja z typu Bols'a idee - Zia X pantery,, x na id¹cy kontrakt, aby odeszli na nieid¹cy |pg||
nt|aldek: w 4-tym, 5-tym i 7-mym byly niewiarygodne motywy w rozgrywce|pg||
nt|awasiak: 1BA standardowo na m³odszych, dalej wszystko naturalne.|pg||
nt|zbig1959: po blokach karta ronie, impas @H podniosl reke W.. (6 rozd)|pg||
nt|friggi: that is too much..hand up|pg||
nt|s bech: Team Yellow now 49 IMPs |pg||
nt|s bech: unexpected when we left in half-time|pg||
nt|arvidsson: this will be a good chance for Kamras, EW will probbebly bid 6 spades|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mlodygda83: czyli znowu odskoczyli, a jeszcze 10 dojdzie|pg||
nt|daman: hopefully they don't get to slam off 2 @ces|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: They're now officially fighting against the clock - 5 boards ought to be played in 25 mins|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once he starts this will not takle long|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'd not hold my breath if they won't make it on time|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|daman: Aces*|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes that has to be the explanation|pg||
nt|friggi: @C lead is also pretty obv in 7@D|pg||
pc|s5|nt|awasiak: Po wejciu dwukolorowym Jeleniewskiego rozgrywaj¹cy ma szansê trafiæ @sD.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right. it might even be right to pass 2S, but can have sympathy for W biddign a second time|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tez: @c leri alýrlarsa tam olacak|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer seem in no need to hurry mood|pg||
nt|ziff:  N/S did very well here to stay out of 3NT despite 25 HCP|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: i am worn out just from commentating, so i can imagine how tired the players are:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: those are 4 days in a row of many boards per day|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|po-s: If 1D really showed diamonds perhaps 2D could be a 2-suiter but in today´s bridge nobody has diamonds just because they bid them - if so 2D ought to show diamonds|pg||
nt|friggi: no values in @S is the main problem for W|pg||
nt|friggi: so @H PASS big time|pg||
nt|friggi: 3@H|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|nobbe: with diamonds 3-3 we have 10 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|rmb1: If the defence don't continue diamonds (revealing the break) declarer can take club finesse|pg||
nt|nobbe: after the first 5 boards scored in the second half, Kamras have increased their lead by 7 more imps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes there is a sense in which W opened 4H here|pg||
nt|arvidsson: Maybe south should x 5 @c?|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|arvidsson: WELL I AM NOT CERTAIN|pg||
nt|arvidsson: sorry caps lock|pg||
nt|friggi: after all this ..yes|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
pc|cK|nt|s bech: yes, slam it is and the pressure is now on North for the only setting lead.  Does she have enough inforation?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|yuval10: i don't think he should X|pg||
nt|yuval10: he doesn't want a @c lead from a bare J for instance|pg||
nt|arvidsson: one cant be sure club is the right lead, could be @D one wants|pg||
nt|yuval10: and if P has JT @c he should hope that she'll find the lead herself|pg||
nt|friggi: if that would be tha case Emma would lead @C J is that a bad lead?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ryskiel_: przepraszam za komentarz - zmêczenie|pg||
nt|cuttysark: In which case you would have to double, or bid 2NT to show the 'unbid'suits|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: and if the bid does show what W has, E is certainly worth another move|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mlodygda83: dobre pytanie|pg||
nt|arvidsson: a diamond lead and a good result for EW|pg||
nt|friggi: yes|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|snetram: jestem przeciwnikiem otwierania 1BA ze zbyt dobrymi 17PC|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: ale to jednak 4333, fakt, ¿e w kontrolach|pg||
nt|affe82:  i don't know about you but with 6 scattered opints red vs red imps i would not put pressure on partner and just invite game with 17+ on other hand. i'd take the plunge. i do go down a lot though. |pg||
pc|sA|nt|atalok: kotunun iyisi|pg||
nt|po-s: 2NT - in the nebulous diamond case - might show the minors|pg||
pc|s6|nt|friggi: @C lead not so good:)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: but should be a push |pg||
pc|cT|pc|s3|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|s bech: diamond lead. lost oppertunity for a slam swing. |pg||
pc|c5|nt|tomek: wist treflowy kladl automatycznie ten kontrakt|pg||
nt|arvidsson: Upmark Cullin will bid it as E in the other room |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|aldek: tymczasem Buras wypuscil 4@D|pg||
nt|zbig1959: jak zaimpasuje @cJ to wygra 4@D|pg||
nt|affe82:  especially knowing that opps need to catch up and are likely to push.|pg||
nt|yuval10: now declarer has 11|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mlodygda83: B-N graj¹ 14-16 wiêc w ogóle nie bêd¹ mieli tego typu problemów w tym rozdaniu|pg||
pc|dK|nt|boomelant: bedzie przymus wyjasniajacy|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So all in all the 1@S overcall in thsi room has a lot to commend it :)|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|vugraphzkk: but sometimes it doesnt work :(|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|tomi2:  that 4333 8 count with no king and ace and no heart stopper wouldnt be my favorite hand for 1nt facing a partner who could be "light on classic shape"|pg||

nt|vugraphzkk: last board for this round|pg||
