pc|cK|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S play needed to make 4@S|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  this agreement gains popularity - if after partner's opening 1nt responder doesn't see more prospects than a game, he bids 4@c (or 4@d) with both majors|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  4@c shows better @h, while 4@d emphasizes @s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Here with 5/5 S had a good bid.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and minimum info for the opps|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @d lead looks normal and thereafter it's hard to bring contract home|pg||

nt|arvidsson: yes|pg||

nt|cicus: let alone some missing HCP's|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: this stage of declarer play is MOST important: the planning|pg||
nt|cicus: now W can take a ruff but the losing @C can be discarded on the 4th spade later|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: can he guess, that @s3 is a single?|pg||
nt|caitlin: I also would not bid 3N, but wondered if North would|pg||

nt|mcarroll: meanwhile, this 3NT does not look like making|pg||
nt|sybarra: "we" might be a trick or so short here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 26 hcp but with @S lead, this contract does not make.|pg||
nt|shevek: hi shirley, everyone |pg||

nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|mcarroll: true my fault for trying to multi-task, trying to keep an eye on Monaco qualifying|pg||
nt|cicus: E could have played a small @S here but it does not help as he has only 1 @C|pg||

nt|sybarra: hi Sabine,  you are always welcome |pg||
nt|rnmalik: It was -1 and now in an effort to make it would be -2.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: no this Tournament goes from Friday till Sunday|pg||
nt|sybarra: from earlier explanation I saw,  the round robin, moves folks up and down the ranks|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: many Teams, who played the Bonn Nations Cup at Wednesday/Thursday stayed here to play the German Trophy too|pg||
pc|s8|nt|h_karluk: 1st doubles are mostly t/o|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: Round Robin was just at the beginning of the Tournament, now they play Swiss System|pg||
nt|rnmalik: So by the end of the day we have 4 top teams. Am I right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: they play in 3 groups, and always after some rounds there come 2/3 teams into the lower group/better group|pg||
nt|caitlin: if he does, he is definitely down|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: now he is reading in the convention card, maybe it helps for his decission...|pg||
nt|caitlin: or count on hand but hard to know if third seat 3@C is 6 or 7 card suit|pg||
nt|cicus: west may be 1327|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unless they start with a level more than 4|pg||
pc|c9|nt|caitlin: a clue is that East did not return club, trying to set one up|pg||
pc|s7|nt|xenya: now he needs to get hearts right to limit the losses|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe only 7 tricks now|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Is Hungarian "Winkiboy" named after their lead - Winkler? I suppose|pg||
nt|xenya: so 3@H was makeable|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: I do not like the 2 @S bid,  (not resulting hand) but seems a bit much |pg||
nt|caitlin: oh well, understandable from declarer's point of view|pg||
nt|cicus: I can't say this was not percentage play, although what if west has only 6 clubs?|pg||
nt|cicus: is that prohibited when vulnerable?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: and squeeze pard at the same time |pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|cicus: of course in that case E made a defensive error by not returning a small spade instead of cashing !ge Queen|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|caitlin: not at all but seems East would have sent through club, trying to set up second trick, which he could do with ONE or TWO|pg||

nt|xenya: we are confronted with lots of artificial bids on both sides it seems|pg||

nt|mcarroll: I have seen many Ws use Michaels on this hand - not my choice I hasten to add|pg||
nt|chick: I don't think 3@C is a very helpful bid in this situation|pg||
nt|arvidsson: thye have all the ques, just missing AQ of @H|pg||

nt|friggi: dec has to take @C A nad fin @S |pg||
nt|arvidsson: doubt he will play for KQ of @D onside|pg||
nt|friggi: agree, but that is the hand you have to draw, if you want to have a chance my friend:)|pg||
nt|s bech: I Dont think spade finesse is best line. just ruff one spade in dummy and try to only have 2 heart loosers|pg||
nt|s bech: or should you play clubs for 5-1 becouse of the lead?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: the best chance must be to play for @H 3-2 (being able for 2 loosers) and clubS 4-2?|pg||
nt|s bech: I think so|pg||
nt|friggi: dec has to play for sin @H|pg||
nt|arvidsson: but the lead is fishy.... maybe one can sniff the 5-1 |pg||

pc|s9|nt|pbundy: very perceptive; i wouldn't be, either|pg||
nt|chick: a knowledgable kib suggests that this might be xy-nt probably 2 c inviting........any hand............. and 2d gameforcing|pg||
nt|daman: a bit unsettling for commentators when the systems are highly unusual|pg||
nt|peachy: the alert shows 1NR as trf, if I understand it correctly, both sides trf?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one might say: "yes but N has AKQ of trumps, and S who was missing them made a try".  true enough, but it was already those 3 top trumps that were the only possible justification ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for the 2S raise, so N has already bid that part of his hand|pg||

nt|s bech: on diamonds|pg||
nt|chick: ah, yes, you are right, because E cannot play a 3rd spade|pg||
nt|s bech: if East holds up K of diamonds when finessed south has no diamond looser|pg||

nt|s bech: I Like this hand East just picked up|pg||
nt|chick: interesting hand, the spade duck at trick 1 is very crucial|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: depending upon North's mood|pg||

nt|yuval10: even though it's an excellent contract|pg||
nt|ziff:  Yes|pg||
nt|s bech: East bidding suggests Jacoby. well, we might get to see these 1D openings. they seem to be rather common. Lucky for E/W howeber to get away with 200 |pg||
nt|s bech: powerful hand north. 4 spades shoud make with an overtrick|pg||
nt|chick: easy 4@S, but EW have a good save in 5@H|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chick: I also considered that, and neither N nor S had an obvious lead, but I can't imagine them actually bidding it|pg||
nt|pbundy: despite the distribution, 3@C would be my call here, too.  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: Polish 1C opening is usually something like this 12-14 HCP, balanced (usually without 4 diamonds) or 4=4=1=4; 15+ HCP with a real club suit;18+ HCP with any shape|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The main problem with the Swedish 1C opening is the lack of flexibility: the "strong" hand types have to take a second bid (or else risk not showing their strength), which does not ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: work well if those hands are not pure two-bid hands. |pg||
nt|chick: this could be bad if EW end in 3N |pg||
nt|chick: 2@C artificial forcing to game|pg||
nt|haans: Wikner may bid 5|pg||
nt|rnmalik: non vul-EW would bid.|pg||

nt|mrdct: but unlikely tpo get there|pg||
nt|s bech: however*|pg||
nt|friggi: it is like the Polish played in the passed|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h by N was very wise, as it convinced E that his P has a @h singel|pg||
nt|chick: 1@D = 11-16, a variety of hands, 0+ diamonds|pg||
nt|chick: 2@D = balanced 11-13|pg||

nt|chick: 3@C for me also, longer suit|pg||
nt|pbundy: our 1st major swing.  n/s reached 3 NT in the other room - and made it - when their counterparts got too high in 5@S|pg||
nt|chick: and now 3@S is cheap to bid|pg||
nt|chick: when you can identify a double-fit against a double-fit, it's important to win the contract ... very risky for a double game swing.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Ultra-light @S overcall here by E.  Hard to see W stopping short of game.|pg||

nt|rnmalik: a trick short on @S lead.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but here declarer has only 8 tricks after @s start and careful discards|pg||
nt|ziff:  And it might drive N/S to 5@S|pg||

nt|chick: this is not quite that situation, but players should consider it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Polish Club is slightly better in this respect since it is a more conservative system. In Swedish Club, the strong hands typically start at 17 HCP, whereas Polish Club requires ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: about one point more than that.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: This may not sound like much of a difference, but it does tend to make the strong types a little more pure.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 4-1 seems to be the normal trump break for NS|pg||
nt|mr murray: not going to make. many cards offside for declarer|pg||
nt|mr murray: and bad trump break|pg||
nt|bridge_one: interesting this overcall in 4 cards majors with a long minor out|pg||
nt|mr murray: one kibbitzer says 5 diamonds a make|pg||
nt|bridge_one: similar at overcall of 1Nt (polish style) with 4Maj and 5+minor, but giving the suit over 1@c strong (here, playing 2 way, is less effective)|pg||

nt|mcarroll: with the 5-2 @C split the grand depends on the @D finesse|pg||
nt|nobbe: and the Q of @H. Grand is not a good contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: they're playing for 5 imps swing here|pg||
nt|chick: well, there's really only one way to play the clubs, and it works|pg||

nt|chick: W should know that his partner is expecting some HCP that he doesn't have|pg||
nt|pbundy: 3@S could be making - along with 3@H.........|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Agreed|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, partnerships need to discuss the difference between pass and 3@S here by E.  One possible understanding is that when pd's cuebid has forced us to a certain level (here, ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@S), bidding it directly shows the weakest hand - and anything else, even passing, shows at least a modicum of game interest.|pg||
nt|yuval10: but as Meckstroth said - those "little"  imps adds quickly|pg||
nt|ziff:  Good decision by N/S, anyway|pg||
nt|arvidsson: lookes like they will end up in an unlucky slam |pg||
nt|chick: I still think it was safer to just win the @HA and get the ruff ... but I suppose at this level, an overtrick can be important|pg||
pc|h5|nt|atalok: 2 numarada diger masada 2 cl acýldý 3 d dendi ama 7 yinede soylenemedi|pg||

nt|jcwla: Wow -- W must have seen some of E's o/c's.|pg||
nt|yuval10: if declarer try to play @h to hand he can suffer 2@d ruffs and go down ( 2@h, 1@c, 2@d )|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as S over 1S, double would make me uneasy. but so would 2C. just goes to show that awful overcalls in spades can still do damage to the opps even at the one level. but without ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: shape they usually do more damage to our side|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, did 2N promise 4S?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, it's not beautiful, esp with a void in pd's suit -- but can retreat to @C's comfortably b/c has 4@H's.  The one thing you don't want to do that you sometimes see newer ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: players do is make this negative double with just the @C -- pd will never stop putting you on @H's.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Don't know, maybe not - my comment above based on the perhaps faulty premise it was a @S raise.|pg||
nt|yuval10: Erev Tov Roland :)  all is well, great to see you here|pg||
nt|affe82: slam in diamonds might be tough on repeated heart leads|pg||

pc|h2|nt|tez: hýzlý 4@h dese þimdi 4@s gelirdi..yavaþ olunca zor|pg||
nt|chick: exactly the same principle I meant about the double-fit hands|pg||
nt|nobbe: 6@H looks most resonable contract|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pbundy: interesting club spots, too|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: 1@h might actually have been natural|pg||
nt|chick: in any case, they arrived at the best spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: North has shown minimum and 6331|pg||
nt|daman: the made 6@H in the OR on Board 2 so a big, fat 17 IMPs to San Sac|pg||
nt|chick: the opps showed their clubs to each other rather than the spades, but in any case, did not lead the !A|pg||
nt|mrdct: this is quite a good layout for declarer despite the 4\2 break|pg||
nt|yuval10: after @d lead declarer will probably play A@h and @h towards hand|pg||
nt|s bech: 2H= 11-13 bal with 4c sup in hearts. |pg||
nt|friggi: what does 3H mean?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: did I say unlucky.... ment very lucky|pg||
nt|chick: 3NN is the contract in OR for bd 2|pg||

nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|chick: @DA*|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very surprising play|pg||
nt|chick: I'm sure it was a spade raise, showing a good hand.  E's pass over 3@D says the rest -- no interest in competing|pg||
nt|jcwla: Even if not, the principle applies to situations where pd has made a conventional raise forcing us to a particular level.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: holding three dead hearts, W probably viewd the negative double as a danger sign when LHO did not bid hearts. also the overcall perhaps is sometimes made on 4 cards. and as u say, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has probably seen the likes of this E hand and perhaps worse:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Right but need partnership agreement -- many pairs play the exact opposite: pass below the level of our force shows some interest.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Back in a flash.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes i never doubted that 2N showed spade support. my question was whether it promised four of them|pg||
nt|yuval10: why didn't S lead a @d ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think N should ask himself that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also, that question was not addressed to the principle you were stating Jordan. I was simply looking for reasons why W did not force to game|pg||
nt|andyv:  white on white save may win a few imps|pg||
nt|po-s: he mght also double and take it 4 down...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cuttysark: Probably a similar defence to what they play over 1NT - to save memory strain|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@d are ON, of course, so the overcall worked very well|pg||
nt|yuval10: you can say Erev tov to Ida as well...she'll understand u well|pg||
pc|d8|nt|chick: this may put Westerlund back up in the scores|pg||

nt|chick: well, credit to them finding a contract that has a chance|pg||
nt|affe82:  without interference that downside is negliable though.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Shabat Shalom Ida :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: he already discounted it with 4@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: after W made another try with 5@c he must respect it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's the case when Q is better than K|pg||
nt|yuval10: AX @d is an asset|pg||
pc|d3|nt|aldek: na Acolu z karami otwieramy w holandii 2@D, zeby grac od silnej reki|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and good swith at trick 2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure why S doubled--was on top of 2S bid and has no heart card|pg||
nt|yuval10: for those who joins us now - the score is incorrect and is upside-down|pg||
nt|s bech: Hans-Ove picks up another 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|affe82: this will be hopeless. as (several) kibber(s) say any defence is setting|pg||

nt|tomek: po 2@S 3@H|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed 5@D is a fortunate make but with a combined 20 count and no special features...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 10 cards in the minors in West are good distributionals value|pg||
nt|mr murray: if opener was an American "naturale" diamond n/s dont buy the hand so easily|pg||
nt|cuttysark: True - the overcall made it impossible for Wset to bid diamonds on his own|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes Murray, 1@D open would work here|pg||
nt|s bech: so we´ll see a swing on scoreborad soon in favour of Skalman|pg||
nt|chick: a boring partscore here ... time to put your laundry in the fridge or get a beer from the dryer ... or is it the other way around?|pg||

nt|yuval10: well bided|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chick: still, no excuse not to pull his partners double with a 6-5 black hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The natural option of the 1C opening bid contains hands of 15-17 HCP which are almost certainly not pure two-bid hands, and so these can be a problem.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: yes, E may even have been a bit reluctant to sign off in 4S, given that he had a very good hand facing a heart splinter|pg||

nt|h_karluk: These hands are also present in the 1C opening in standard systems, but there you have the option of rebidding in a new suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tempting to jump to 6S over 5C by W, but if W has a heart void there could be a grand slam|pg||
pc|d4|nt|chick: but they must have some way of putting on the brakes|pg||

nt|vugraphzkk: really very strange, why east just didnt want to claim here... I dont think such good players throw away the wrong card...|pg||
nt|shevek: EW might even make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: yes|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rnmalik: better|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Evet|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C by N?|pg||
nt|sybarra: think we missed a pass  |pg||
mb|1S|nt|xenya: 2 imps to Winkiboy on 2 -- same contract but declarer took 8 tricks |pg||
nt|dimi: i think 6@s by W is on|pg||
nt|dimi: by E a @c lead will beat|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|xenya: did N really double here?|pg||
nt|shevek: tell them Lukas :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|friggi: that is more like it:)|pg||
nt|xenya: he has a pure yarborough|pg||
nt|xenya: but he also has 3 hearts in support for partner|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphpl2: we had some problems with connections or so, now we're back:)|pg||
nt|cicus: 3@S must be a transfer to 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: 3NT needs some work|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i admit was indeed disciplined as David wisely pointed out|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe that accounts for it? |pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: yes|pg||
nt|cicus: then they probably play 3NT rsponse as some self-dangerous artificial bid :)|pg||
nt|shevek: pity it's wrongsided|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  S is happy to show both - maximum overcall and @h with his DBL|pg||
pc|h4|nt|h_karluk: maybe with little defense, we ll see|pg||
nt|jtr: I am sure Salvo will find a way|pg||
nt|h_karluk: is he a magician, i thought i am alone:)|pg||
nt|jtr: @d to the 7 at trick 2 i guess|pg||
nt|xenya: so N didn't psyche at adverse vulnerability after all :)|pg||
nt|shevek: hmmm|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 was ok,  2 is certainly mor difficult |pg||
pc|h2|nt|jtr: Not at all  Lovely guy too|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  seems, N wasn't sure about @h|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @S is puppet,  saying I have 4 @H |pg||
pc|h3|nt|rnmalik: 3NT-top 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will make in a breeze |pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: forgetting one pass makes everybody confused :-D|pg||
nt|friggi: yes 2NT should be 23-24|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe cuebidding would have been better|pg||
nt|dimi: 3@s was forcing?|pg||
nt|shevek: didn't think so|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|xenya: on 3 NS in the other room stopped in a quiet 1N making -- 12 imps to Winkiboy |pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: NS*|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: 4 hts pretty easy also |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|jtr: OK This worked better|pg||
nt|dimi: a kip told me it would be forcing ... hmmm|pg||
nt|shevek: 7 certain tricks , one will come from @d or @c|pg||
pc|h6|nt|shevek: even so, BW with a void wouldn't be recommended|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: for W 3@s is forcing, but they dont agree about this bid|pg||
pc|c5|pc|hK|nt|dimi: right Nicoleta|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i have to be objective and impartial, however "gl sahib" :) (friendly code between I and him since long years)|pg||
nt|shevek: aha|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|sybarra: just a bit messier |pg||
nt|friggi: like 3NT better|pg||
nt|cicus: S has to return @Ds to cut dummy off its @S10|pg||
nt|cicus: @S9  , I mean|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|xenya: i wish i knew the meaning of all those bids, but the final contract is almost perfect |pg||
nt|xenya: 4@S was a fair alternative of course|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mcarroll: But as it turns out, @D play better, the 4-1 @H split would make a @H contract at the 3 level a major problem|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes but given the 4/4 fit at the table we probably all select 4 @H |pg||
nt|shevek: is north considering a duck here?|pg||
nt|shevek: after all north wouldn't have a clue that west holds 6@hs :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: if so, East gets an overtrick...|pg||
nt|dimi: can't believe ... maybe on his way to bar?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|friggi: truth but that bidding is overrated given that you miss a lot of Aces:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy for us to second guess from this altitude |pg||
nt|shevek: here...|pg||
pc|cT|nt|cicus: well, not necessary, as E has only 8 tricks anyway|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|jtr: kinderleicht ein Kinderspiel|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|pc|d3|nt|vugraphzkk: if you play like this in brd 12, you tell the opponents: "I think you are stupid" ...|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: logical line|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|caitlin: West was overly optomistic, for sure|pg||
nt|cicus: oops, now S can be endplayed into leading away from @CK|pg||
nt|cicus: could have unblocked @HQ|pg||
nt|caitlin: should have|pg||
nt|cicus: even|pg||
nt|cicus: he knew N had solid @Hs|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: If Ron Pachtmann will use this option? We will see...|pg||
nt|caitlin: the @HJ by North showed a good sequence of T9 as well |pg||
nt|caitlin: does he know he has an endplay?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: but with QJ109 he would discard Q (and not J) at first, isnt it so?|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s8|nt|shevek: north wasn't looking at dummy I guess|pg||
mc|9|nt|cicus: yes, he knows the location of the @HQ, only does not know it is doubleton|pg||
nt|caitlin: declarer had to play hearts first|pg||

nt|sybarra: and an easy 4 @H here |pg||
nt|shevek: it has been an accident in bd 11 (worth 11 imps)|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe many long days of playing contributing |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jtr: 1NT for me|pg||
nt|h_karluk: balanced seat|pg||
nt|h_karluk: good guess boss|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|h_karluk: sorta biz X, shld work now|pg||

nt|sybarra: bd 20 the other room used a smolen type sequence to get to game |pg||

nt|xenya: he is prepared to sacrifice in clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: ah, @D finesse taken there as well?|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: 2@C is catch all for game force|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|tomi2:  somebody knows the meaning of 3@C? maybe a transfer to @D?|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|caitlin: 5@H leads to slam|pg||

nt|cicus: 5@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: 5@h just invitational|pg||

nt|caitlin: that is one advantage of S bidding 1NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like N has a natural @c lead now|pg||
nt|arvidsson: hard to know in the bidding who of opponents have the K of clubs, so one would know who should be declarer|pg||
nt|chick: 3@S apparently preemptive, but N goes anyway|pg||
nt|s bech: if decl playes clubs for 3-1 he will go down|pg||
mb|2N|nt|atalok: hehee|pg||
nt|atalok: bu el nerde biter?|pg||
nt|tomek: widac brak zgrania w parze|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: zgraj¹ sie w meczu o 3 miejsce|pg||
nt|awasiak: Znowu 14 punktów na starszej szóstce, karta jeszcze ³adniejsza ni¿ w 6. Widaæ, ¿e nie naci¹gaj¹ silnych otwaræ.|pg||
nt|zbig1959: tia, podawano j¹ i dlatego Bogus (pi¹cy) wybra³ pesymistyczne 2@H|pg||
nt|chick: N had the chance right there to X over 2@H|pg||
nt|chick: for S is harder without either minor|pg||
nt|yuval10: the 1@d opening will probably take NS to 2NT|pg||
nt|ziff:  N would have liked to double for take-out :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am astonished that declarer went down in 4H|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite reasonable to play S for 2-2 @h IMO|pg||
nt|yuval10: S for singel @h rather|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure why the rush to play @s.... Martin's line would have given a 2nd chance with no risk|pg||
nt|haans: do not like that 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: so San-Sac shouldn't feel ashame - it happenes sometimes|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt easy make|pg||
nt|yuval10: or even more if S feels optimistic|pg||
nt|mrdct: well judged by east|pg||
nt|chick: it may be that 2@S shows a minimum hand, too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: K of D??|pg||
nt|yuval10: now likely to matter that much here, seem like 11 tricks in 3NT |pg||
nt|marlowepi: sort of works|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: a bit wet by both sides?|pg||
nt|chick: so I predict 2@H+2 and time to make some tea :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that might be an overbod...couldnt W have 6HCP?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N had passed in 3rd seat at favorable and had already shown up with a ton of HCP. it had to be S with the @HQ|pg||
nt|chick: yes, this is the usual restricted choice situation when I am playing :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3NT or 4@H?|pg||
nt|turnip1: No exitement on this board, but exiting leaderboard 151-151-149|pg||
mb|p|nt|atalok: en tehlikeli sekans|pg||

nt|tomek: teraz maja latwiej na rozgrywce|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, i dont see how it could not show a minimum|pg||
nt|s bech: Bad breaks in 4sp but if defence missplays it will make|pg||
nt|chick: losing 2 @Ss, 1 @H, 1@C?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Me neither esp at red|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: ah bi @d 9 lun olsa ortak|pg||

nt|boomelant: 3@d 1314 pc 5-5 lub 4@s 6@d|pg||
nt|zbig1959: ostra X, na wist @S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: If my memory serves well Carrot Club (or Morotsklöver in Swedish) is also a big club system, developed in the 1970s and played in international teams championships by Anders Morath ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and Sven-Olof Flodquist.|pg||
nt|chick: 1N 17-19 I suspect, so W declines the invitation|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@d means 4+@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: right on Liz|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed it does - best to laugh about it and move on|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@d was @d and major i persume|pg||
nt|haans: 4 Ts is a lot|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is not about shape, but about HCP, N was marked with 1o HCP already|pg||
nt|ziff:  Unless he held @CQ, which was more or less imposible after @CA play|pg||
mb|p|nt|kamyk: taka pochwa³a oczywistego wistu (na niedogran¹ koñcówkê) to próba uzyskania psychicznej przewagi na stole - nie jest to szczyt elegancji|pg||

nt|yuval10: oh, ok|pg||
nt|haans: and one T98|pg||
nt|haans: no Ts will be of value|pg||
nt|haans: sort of ...|pg||
nt|yuval10: *not|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think 4@h is too much from W|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, he has already shown something close to this|pg||
nt|yuval10: P already warned you that all his values are in @s and you have XXX @c|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right, and the defense marked N with KY of D also|pg||
nt|marlowepi: KJ|pg||
nt|friggi: S should be the dec in 7@D:)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: KQ behind the one who showed @H yes clubs seems natural to lead|pg||
nt|s bech: juniorbridge, i love it!|pg||
nt|friggi: and now it is set:)|pg||
nt|chick: hmmm, they have to set this a lot to compensate for a vul game|pg||
pc|h5|nt|atalok: 3nt degil bence|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: lekko krzywe otwarcie w tym rozdaniu nie przynios³o sukcesu|pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: ale juz od¿yli i analizuj¹ rozdanie :)|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: a tymczasem Auguri w 6 zagra³o 6|pg||
nt|xenya: in particular, i don't quite understand W's 2@H|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: switch ten and 7 of spades and i think there would be a guard squeeze for 6N without a spade lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: yep and persumably N would've opened with 12 points and 4 @s's|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes that was my point. probably any 12 points but for sure with 4S which were known about|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 7@D is 4 off|pg||
nt|friggi: yes|pg||
nt|s bech: unlucky for E/W that N gets a chance to lead club if they reach, But that might not be the only lead she´s thinking about.|pg||
nt|arvidsson: onless a club lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2uj293f  running scores|pg||
nt|arvidsson: on a club lead it is 5 |pg||
nt|friggi: so he will play for 2-2|pg||

nt|tomek: 3-cia dama kier pod nozem daje szanse na wygranie|pg||
nt|peachy: difficult to follow a completely artificial auction|pg||
nt|yuval10: the players here played all day long and fatigue probably takes its toll|pg||
nt|affe82: could be as expensive as 800|pg||
nt|chick: that would be enough :)|pg||
nt|affe82: looks like a good decision by NS|pg||
nt|chick: and the @CQJ is revealed, so no mistakes there|pg||
nt|chick: a nice system that worked well on this hand|pg||
nt|s bech: will declarer play clubs for ruff at this point? ending up with 5 sp 2 cl 2 he and one ruff |pg||
pc|h4|pg||

nt|marlowepi: maybe there is one still with spade jack lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: OR has already finished while we have 5 more boards to go|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ah no, cant get to E hand to lead heart to ten without burning an entry|pg||
nt|chick: unfortunately those pretty diamond honors don't give useful pitches|pg||
nt|s bech: after cl A west should lead hearts|pg||
pc|c2|nt|atalok: muhtemel artý 1 olacak|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: w rozdaniu 7|pg||
nt|zbig1959: akcja z typu Bols'a idee - Zia X pantery,, x na id¹cy kontrakt, aby odeszli na nieid¹cy |pg||
nt|aldek: w 4-tym, 5-tym i 7-mym byly niewiarygodne motywy w rozgrywce|pg||
nt|awasiak: 1BA standardowo na m³odszych, dalej wszystko naturalne.|pg||
nt|zbig1959: po blokach karta ronie, impas @H podniosl reke W.. (6 rozd)|pg||
nt|friggi: that is too much..hand up|pg||
nt|s bech: Team Yellow now 49 IMPs |pg||
nt|s bech: unexpected when we left in half-time|pg||
nt|arvidsson: this will be a good chance for Kamras, EW will probbebly bid 6 spades|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mlodygda83: czyli znowu odskoczyli, a jeszcze 10 dojdzie|pg||
nt|daman: hopefully they don't get to slam off 2 @ces|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: They're now officially fighting against the clock - 5 boards ought to be played in 25 mins|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once he starts this will not takle long|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'd not hold my breath if they won't make it on time|pg||
nt|chick: and with the bad spade lie, -1 for sure now|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|daman: Aces*|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes that has to be the explanation|pg||
nt|friggi: @C lead is also pretty obv in 7@D|pg||
mc|10|nt|awasiak: Po wejciu dwukolorowym Jeleniewskiego rozgrywaj¹cy ma szansê trafiæ @sD.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right. it might even be right to pass 2S, but can have sympathy for W biddign a second time|pg||
nt|s bech: if decl can throw away hearts on diamonds, and play all his clubs East will be endplayd on spades|pg||

nt|vugraphzkk: thanks too|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  for Bonn Nationa Cup, there were on-line scores. and what about this tournamnet?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: there are also online scores|pg||
nt|yuval10: it's a matter of imp anyway - -17 instead of -16|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: 4@h is a good sacrifice against 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 2@d multy here|pg||
nt|xenya: somewhat unexpectedly, the match is almost even -- it did look as though Winkiboy had an upper hand |pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|cicus: so a useful win for Turkey|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jtr: A wild one too|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/bgt_2010/10_05_14_wer.html - these ones, t.y.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: yes|pg||
nt|shevek: allowed 2@s, 2@h,  @d and 2@c only|pg||
nt|dimi: last board for this set|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that is easy to find |pg||
mb|d|nt|yuval10: they missed chances in board 4 and 5|pg||
nt|cicus: this board is not going to alter the result|pg||
nt|cicus: N has a 3@H bid in my opinion|pg||
nt|cicus: and S will carry on to game|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: well, i think board 14 will bring some IMPs for Israel|pg||
nt|cicus: N has to filler cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and this is easy |pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: 2@h is more often 5 than 6 cards...|pg||
nt|yuval10: both should've been a pickup for Winklboy team and turned into minus|pg||
mb|2C|nt|tomi2:  seems they also use transfers after 1@C-x|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|cicus: two*|pg||
nt|shevek: not as easy as the previous board, true|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: obviously 2N here is hearts and minor|pg||
nt|cicus: S is overbidding now|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|cicus: as 3@H was not forcing, he should have settled for game|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: 2NT = @h+@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkk: but sometimes it doesnt work :(|pg||
nt|caitlin: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: in this board the computer says that 3NT are makeable|pg||
nt|shevek: similar in a way|pg||
nt|sybarra: last bd of this set,  thx again Lukas. Great job!|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmmm|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: they even didnt find 3NT, so no decision problem for S|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  that 4333 8 count with no king and ace and no heart stopper wouldnt be my favorite hand for 1nt facing a partner who could be "light on classic shape"|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also to Nicoleta,  great to be with you again |pg||
nt|shevek: thx shirley|pg||
nt|shevek: great job Lukas|pg||
nt|sybarra: back how soon Lukas?|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Open Room is slowere than here, but all the scores so far have beento the Hungarian team|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: last board for this round|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and 3NT should make|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: seems, that Hungary will win this fight...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Declarer has 2@H, 3@S 3 minor tricks and N will be endplayed to give the 9th|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Drew,  great point on the previous hand |pg||
pc|cK|nt|h_karluk: appreciated Lukas& David - hey i wont pay say your hairs became more white bcoz of me..lol |pg||

nt|h_karluk: *stay safe|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yuval10: one may wonder why did E took off the X|pg||
nt|shevek: If west opens that kind of 11, partner should be aware ...|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is last bd of this set |pg||
nt|yuval10: did well to prevent an overtrick|pg||
nt|sybarra: my schedule shows very shortly |pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would you prefer 2NT by E for shape or feature etc as per their agreement. Would make 6.|pg||
nt|shevek: I think we had a late start this match though shirley|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: thx to Lukas our terrific operator |pg||
nt|xenya: now this is a really good lesson never get disheartened by a bad result: your counterparts in the other room may do equally badly|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: yes  we did |pg||
pc|h6|pc|c6|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, Lukas, bd 14 may bring in a handful of IMPs for Israel, if they can cope with the hand|pg||
