mb|1C!|an|Polish|mb|p|nt|jtr: 3NT looks like a good result|pg||
nt|roswolf: from the north side 3nt looks infrangible|pg||
mb|1H!|mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Infrangible is a word I use at least 15 times a day|pg||
nt|jtr: @s lead was it?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: a Polish style 1C basically means that all balanced hands are opened with 1@C, unless they are opened with 1NT|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont call a helpful lead and a J find infrngianything|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|jtr: Where the auction was invitational as next door, i am really surprised at the lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: ahhh the beauties of the english language|pg||

nt|henryb:  guessing the club without any problem! I would have more trouble|pg||
nt|daman: not a trying contract now|pg||
nt|henryb:  really? what are his 9 tricks?|pg||
nt|jcmax: This will not be so easy from here. zia will have to find a @D switch. And when declarer plays low from dummy W will have to duck his K|pg||
nt|jtr: Which?|pg||
nt|roswolf: confucius he say the opening lead determines the beauty of the contract |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|henryb:  I see 8. but a passive defense might create trouble|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, a @c exit would not have done|pg||
nt|jtr: Declarer can then play Ax@d and West either takes for nine tricks or East gets endplayed|pg||
nt|nezihk: j hearts kill declarer|pg||

nt|roswolf: a spec has informed me -  Ezra Pound said 'beauty is difficult" how apt!|pg||
nt|jcmax: Hmm, I just noticed the @C-suit actually is blocked. So if Zia had returned the @HJ after winning the @CA, declarer never would have reached any @D-tricks. Tough!|pg||

nt|hedyg: like 5@H?|pg||

nt|hedyg: we have seen it before today|pg||

nt|sybarra: was clearly before I got out of bed,  its only 714a here now |pg||

pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|hedyg: how can he show 4 controls?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|hedyg: K@d is 1 control, the 2 aces are 2 each, that makes 5|pg||

pc|s5|nt|mich-b: but East did not have a comfortable way back into the auction|pg||
nt|mich-b: and refused to try a balancing double, because his @CK is working only in defense|pg||
nt|hedyg: would a nice Dutch guy do that?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or as Gary says|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmmmmmmmmmm...  I think so!!!|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: I'm told 2N = weak @D raise|pg||
nt|hedyg: ahhhhhhhhh ty|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I think there were several wasted rounds of bidding there :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: and that approach suggests  (esp. white) E felt they were not going to get Killed |pg||
pc|s9|nt|sybarra: but good for vugraph |pg||

pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sybarra: have other bids to "be serious" |pg||
nt|hedyg: i think it is more like : they are in gf, please lead @d pd|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kiwibridge: 2@S showing @D would have been more exciting|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: now has to rely on spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: but as we can see all hands all lines make|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mich-b: East should not ruff now|pg||
nt|mich-b: he would be ruffing a loser , of course|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|hedyg: he didnt expect this?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: now 2 rounds of trumps then if both follow no prob if spades dont break|pg||

nt|hedyg: after a @s lead they switch to @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni doesnt like it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S hoping for 1255|pg||
nt|jcwla: Many would use something like 3@D by E to show a LR in @S.  3@S often just shows a max single raise.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|sybarra: always has smile on face,  |pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: got there!|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well a good result for Iceland extracti8ng maximum avaialble on the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Jansma is extremely proud of his hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: with @hs 3 3 this should make nicely|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very friendlt hand for NS|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard to lead a D, and with clubs 22 doesnt matter|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Jordan i am surprised by the 3@s bid too|pg||
nt|jcwla: It's pretty much implicit that S has to have some fit for one of the minors here.  Probably not trotting out 4@H for the first time without the ability to go to 5m as needed.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean after one spade|pg||
nt|pelu: what would u bid? - 3@S NF - they can use 3@c and 3@D as fircing/invitational bids|pg||
nt|marlowepi: defense has a chance on spade out and diamond shift|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure they can|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: would need to lead K@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: so he should be :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL |pg||
nt|marlowepi: N could decide to play W for three clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unwise X in my opinion|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surely S was prepared all along to bid 5C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W opened in 3rd seat at favorable|pg||
nt|hedyg: X= i underbid my hand ?|pg||
nt|jcwla: W white on red in third, E does not have trump trick - I agree with your assessment, Marshall.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mich-b: East knows that East will not have 4 card @S support|pg||
nt|hedyg: the balancing double by Fantoni allowed E to bid again and get to play in his 7 card suit|pg||
nt|mich-b: he would raise to 2@S with that rather than pass|pg||
nt|mich-b: so he prefers the 7 card suit , to the 4-3 fit|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|hedyg: tricky lead!|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: those @C's are only useful as trumps|pg||
nt|hedyg: for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: @cs 3-2, @ss on side..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Fantunes play what are called Slavinsky leads very tricky|pg||
nt|hedyg: and they only underlead aces when it is right :p|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: of course|pg||
nt|mich-b: best for he defense is to stay passive, and let declarer work on the @S suit himself|pg||
nt|hedyg: E surely has a singleton @H or void, the question is where is the 10@H (for Fantoni)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not normally this slow when defending a part score|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni? LOL|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: even he|pg||
nt|hedyg: yesterday there was a miracle when the table where both Fantoni and Muller played finished before the other table|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: rehi all |pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Shirley.|pg||
nt|hedyg: re|pg||
nt|marlowepi: doubling on the diamonds very dubious because S has announced trick source in hearts and E has 3 small|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no D is o nly chance|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now|pg||
nt|hedyg: might play @c|pg||
nt|pelu: look at that dummy - East prob play @cs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: D only chance|pg||
nt|hedyg: or even @H in case S has K@s and W A@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i predict he will play diamond king|pg||
nt|pelu: Mullers best chance : I take my X back :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S marked with one diamond at most|pg||
nt|hedyg: how can that beat it?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am with Peter :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: undo the double |pg||
nt|marlowepi: in fact, since S is known to have 6 strong hearts from the auction, his pass marks him with this shape almost surely|pg||
nt|pelu: the best chance is 4-6-1-2 in S and then he sh play C to kill Ss hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: diamond lead is only chance because declarer might play W for three clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: declarer will play to win|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that shape is almost impossible,|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi Marschall - have a bet (just a coke) - No @D from East :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: on a @d back he can play 2 @hs to disc 1 @d and ruff 3, last ruff W overruffs with ace and thats all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when we look at the auction that S has followed, it is clear he was always preared to bid 5C, and he did not open with six strong hearts which almost surely means 4 spades. hence ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4603|pg||
nt|pelu: No Marshal, 2@H = 10-13 HCP|pg||

mc|11|nt|jcwla: As a player just starting out, one might wonder how S knew to value their hand so highly.  This hand shows the power of distribution.  With W and E bidding and raising @S's, ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: partner is marked with shortness.  Meanwhile, pd should have creditable suits at this vulnerability and that gives the S hand very few losers off the top.|pg||

nt|hedyg: almost...|pg||
nt|hedyg: but can he be doubling here for -1?|pg||
nt|hedyg: isn't that very dangerous?|pg||
nt|lestergold: depends which heart nour played first|pg||
nt|lestergold: honour|pg||
nt|lestergold: morelikely to play overfcaller forv short heart|pg||

nt|jcmax: That 3@C bid was not without risk. But without it might S have led a @D against 4@S? that would have given declarer an easier time|pg||
nt|jcmax: The play on this hand will take a long time, i expect....|pg||

mb|p|nt|jaapfr: this is a potential disaster -3 if passed|pg||
nt|hedyg: Baldursson : they always bid my doubelton when i double!!!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: when 60 down, might you think of more?|pg||
nt|hedyg: doubleton*|pg||
nt|lestergold: could have shown a good 5@d bid by first bidding 4n then correcting 5@c to dims but i dont think north would have bid 6 even then |pg||
mb|p|nt|mich-b: but getting 1100 here will be almost as good perhaps|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you believe other room 6@C bid?|pg||
nt|mich-b: note Fantoni's pass , on the strength of his @H10|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: S is definitely too good for a 3@c bid and how else to get to 6@c?|pg||
nt|hedyg: would that not have shown 2 places to play ?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|hedyg: in a good hand|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|mich-b: no, i dont think other room will reach 6@C , but thats not impossible|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you rite -1100 more likely|pg||
nt|mich-b: the way to get to 6@C , is for South to double, North to show values via Lebensohl, and South to complete the description by bidding @Cs , going past 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: need to remove the @c ruff|pg||
nt|hedyg: for most players 2NT would be weak|pg||
nt|hedyg: (lebensohl)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: quess @HJ or @S9|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni knows that Nunes does not have the J@s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @DJ mb too DD|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they'll be pushing to finish before the next scheduled start time|pg||
nt|hedyg: so playing @s is not tempting|pg||
nt|sybarra: now where to begin |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kiwibridge: "a card"|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not too DD for fantoni:)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: at first yes but the second bid would have corrected taht impression|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could still have 4+@s and long @ds|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh,  as we can see probably low @D works better |pg||
nt|jcwla: Not free of pitfalls.  Meanwhile, 1 was a push when 3NT made in the OR, also with the help of a @S trick.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|hedyg: went all the way to dummy to play K@D?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: may as well go light now|pg||
nt|lestergold: With 4 spades and 5+ dims he would bid 4@s not risking the 5 level|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Missed it again, I'm very sorry.|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok np|pg||
nt|hedyg: Mike he could have a better hand with @s and @d and not want to just bid 4@s?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pretty tough contract to play i would say|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|hedyg: now J@H|pg||
nt|jaapfr: would love to hear his thinking analysis in these both tricks:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: if they play @s to ace and a @D back he can ruff and play K@C since S surely has A@c and no more @hs|pg||
nt|lestergold: possible but more important to use the 4n bid in the manner i described that standard bidding to show good dims|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: i think S should have won the D to play hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: what for?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe not |pg||
nt|hedyg: they are not going anywhere|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well i was thinking, to avoid this defence|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
nt|pelu: the winning line is (I hope :) to play @s to finess in trick 3 and then @d3 from hand|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: but jack of diamonds would allow H to go away while N ruffs, so S was correct, my error|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jaapfr: but same -4|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|jaapfr: provided @HJ NOW:)|pg||
nt|mich-b: now he can play the @HJ safely|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2 was predictably 12 IMPs to Angelini as the OR N/S got to 4@C making 5 as against 5@CX making here.|pg||

nt|jcmax: He didn't have to cope with a 1NT overcall, though, like in the other room|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Because you are an honourable member of the VUBPW, Henry|pg||
nt|jcmax: Not clear to me this will make. If S goes out of his way showing declarer all his points, declarer may misguess the @H|pg||

nt|henryb:  terrible contract. once again 3N is better, as it was on board 3|pg||
nt|jcmax: Now however declarer runs the risk of getting into a situation, where he in the endgame persuades himself that N is left with a doubleton @C-honour|pg||

nt|roswolf: bravissimo you mean|pg||
nt|pelu: strange bidding - I also have the CC - and hedy are correct 1@H = 12-14|pg||
nt|marlowepi: from E point of view, hearts were more likely to be 52 because of the 3-level negative double|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hedyg: lol yes!|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kiwibridge: now 6@S ns|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but for Fantoni routine to find best line:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is wonderful that the Dutch have these generous sponsors!|pg||

nt|hedyg: why only 6?|pg||

mb|4H|nt|jaapfr: 7@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: one of the few countries that have such sponsors|pg||
nt|lc: E-W have a slam -- but have gone conservative.|pg||
nt|pelu: 0.1 sec again Hedy :)|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 2@c FG|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and they will bid that|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c = gf with @c or balanced or fit @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: A light 2@H here.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N obviously also feared doubleton heart in S hand as he did not play a heart right away when in with spade|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@h was down|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: can now disc a @s on @H|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kiwibridge: and a claim at trick 1|pg||
nt|lc: It's easy for us to say that West should have balanced, but we see all 52 cards.|pg||
nt|sybarra: being red,  not easy to jump into this bidding maybe|pg||
nt|lc: South could have had some of those hearts that East has.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not a great @H suit he has|pg||
nt|lc: There is an expression to cover West's decision: "It is dangerous to bid, it is dangerous to pass."  This time it was the latter.|pg||
nt|hedyg: nobody can accuse Jansma of lack of courage :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT serious asking for cuebids|pg||
nt|hedyg: and make on a @c guess, but needs a very good guess|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pelu: as I see - no lead can defeat 5@D by force|pg||
nt|jcwla: A reasonable question to ask is "How will this do if pd has seven points?"|pg||
nt|hedyg: tricky @C, would play same from A@c|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H asked for @c?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Q of clubs and spade back may be best chance, as N would misguess. but that opening lead would be.........difficult to find:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he shd play low despite opening bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean overcall|pg||
nt|hedyg: hard to believe Muller is handing him the @c suit on a platter|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|jaapfr: IF knowing 2 clubs and AK K THen we all bid 7@S:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4NT= even number of keycards|pg||
nt|lc: It's not much fun to be -110 or -130 when you have 1430 available (although, N-S have a good sacrifice against slam).|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: harder to believe he is quickly playing a club from the ace. also he needs much more to be the case to play for club ace on|pg||
nt|pelu: wd|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: if he can assume that W has 5 @hs then the small @H was preferential|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@c= Q@S?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|hedyg: 5@D = yes and K@D?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the crux of this board is the xx of S in @C during bidding|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh 5@c cue and 5@d cue|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and not a 3 card or 4|pg||
nt|hedyg: he got his ruff going now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if club king holds there is still a lot of work to do|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h4|nt|hedyg: 5NT asks for Q@s for 7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: very nice play will be shorter than bidding?|pg||
nt|hedyg: instant claim|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: even with Fantoni declarer|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes even |pg||

nt|hedyg: of course|pg||
nt|pelu: cu soon|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Almost a textbook weak-2 here. (or Multi)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: multi it is|pg||
nt|lc: The big weakness of Multi is that with a weak-2 in @S it often allows opponents in with a @H overcall -- but here, South just didn't have enough.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hedyg: yes Bob|pg||
nt|roswolf: well more mixed hand here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: meanwhile 19 to Welland on 1NX and 6@D making|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2H|nt|hedyg: why pass by Brink?|pg||
nt|pelu: why not 2@S from W?|pg||
nt|lc: If 2@S was pass/correct, that would seem to be a better choice.  |pg||
nt|hedyg: would we all have bid 2@H as W, i would have bid 2@s (positive in @H)|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S = P/C|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh well, we all agree|pg||
nt|lc: So, strange to bid 2@H|pg||
nt|lc: Gives an extra "round" of bidding making it easier for opps to judge.|pg||
nt|pelu: if we all agree - not good :):)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@HX= takeout of @H|pg||
nt|lc: So important to thoroughly know your agreement against these Multi auctions.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: super max for 2@C (11-15 and 6 card suit)|pg||
nt|hedyg: if they go on like this we will have a 3rd miracle today and Muller / Fantoni will finish before the other table again!|pg||
nt|jcwla: If they bid this slam against you, get back into bed, pull the covers up around you, and don't come out for 24 hours.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d looks right|pg||
mb|4D|nt|hedyg: 3@d???|pg||
nt|hedyg: is this a transfer?|pg||
nt|lc: Perhaps they treat the X as a strong notrump, and over interference they play x-fer lebensohl --  that, or a typo.|pg||
nt|hedyg: strange IF the double shows short @hs|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: No typos|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|lc: This surely tests the partnership agreements.  Even a long-time experienced partnership such as N-S can have trouble with such auctions.|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 7 EW are in 5@c XX|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty specs :)|pg||
nt|lc: Sounds like we'll lose everyone watching.  Who wouldn't want to watch 5@C XX!|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg: we all know 5@c XX makes so not really exciting|pg||
nt|pelu: just 11 tricks from the top - and some play for 12 :(|pg||
nt|lc: So, how does 5@CXX compare to the 1430 that was available in 6@H?|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe it is more fun to see if Baldursson-Jonsson will play in a 4-1 fit. :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: much more fun|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6 a push at 3@S making.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this will be a struggle|pg||
nt|hedyg: they open 1@c with 12.14 balanced|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d stopped Fantoni bidding 3@s|pg||
nt|pelu: super optimist - going for slam opp a passed pd|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d bid not a surprise for Muller|pg||
nt|pelu: but he is correct|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hedyg: 4@S= we have take-off|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think you have to be a superoptimist with those clubs and those hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: a small @s lead is needed here|pg||
nt|hedyg: and then lean back and wait|pg||
nt|lc: 4th from your longest and strongest.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|jaapfr: sstruggle for who?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5!X XX = 1000 and 15 imps|pg||
nt|lc: They can run to 4@C -- and not get X, I'd think.|pg||
nt|lc: What if North runs to 4@D, though, thinking 3@D was natural!|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmmm|pg||
nt|hedyg: Jansma trying to scare them into 4@h|pg||
nt|pelu: last time EW X - they was close to push opp in 5@c (4@c +1) - no danger here for EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|lc: Are they using screens? (I doubt it for this kind of match) --  it would be nice to know the table action on who is alering what to whom.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: Bob usually shows the alerts|pg||
nt|hedyg: not this time though|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Yes, screens, I'll add the alerts.|pg||
nt|lc: Well, if ever there was an alert, 3@D had to be one.  :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d did too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Iceland is a strong bridge nation. The proudest moment in Icelandic bridge was obviously in 1991 when the team won the World Championships (Bermuda Bowl) in Yokohama, Japan, by ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: defeating Poland in the final|pg||
mb|6H|nt|roswolf: a hopeless struggle for declarer|pg||

nt|jaapfr: @DQ|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|sK|pg||
nt|jcwla: 7 a push at 1NT making 2.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni passed over 4@d so he wants another lead|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure De wijs didn't exp singelton @s by pd - thjey have 10 card an never bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: that lead saved a trick|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: Jansma showed either 2 cards in @S or singleton|pg||
nt|lc: We can see that East can throw minors on the @H's -- but -- it won't be clear to him.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I was born in 1991,|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
nt|hedyg: disced an ace|pg||
nt|lc: He is probably thinking : "If @S run, down anyway, so let me make sure not to throw away a minor."|pg||
nt|lc: For example, a @D discard would be disastrous if declarer had @DAKQxx.|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose a @C discard is unlikely to hurt in most layouts.|pg||
nt|pelu: can W signal in "hs that he like the @S-lead?|pg||
nt|lc: Smith echo -- hi-lo in @H would say "Like @S"|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose having a 2nd space could mean liking them.|pg||
nt|hedyg: no Smith on their CC|pg||
nt|pelu: LH = even - no "smith"|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, Baldursson was surely pleased to see a @S discard.  :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: and Lavinthal|pg||
nt|pelu: so S sh take another @H and hope that East will disc a @s|pg||
nt|lc: sounds good to me.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I lost it.|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry N - but same hope :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: bd 10 3NT in OR, no double|pg||

nt|hedyg: he will clear the @hs|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jaapfr: but would we not all lead @SK against this bidding?|pg||
nt|lc: Here, West has to keep @HKx and East @HJx -- on a double-dummy basis.  So, then they can be tossed in.|pg||
nt|lc: But, declarer is not playing double-dummy. Just work on @H and hope defense doesn't figure out what to do.|pg||

nt|roswolf: i would always bid 1@S |pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|jcmax: sometimes it is a good idea to bid 1NT on hands like this because it can make it easier to get to @D later. if you respond with 1@S and partner bids 2@C over that, it is impossible ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: to get to @D anymore.|pg||
nt|roswolf: a spec suggests an italian's convention (Garozzo !?) over 1@H 2@S = 4 @S + 6 of minor :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Interesting aspect Sabine mentions. You miss a possible spade fit of course, but in the long run I think it's right to respond 1NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice gadget if you have it in your bag|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: 1@H  1@S   is actually not a very good start to an auction. It often turns out to create problems later|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It sounds economical, and in a sense it is, but it does not always work that way|pg||
nt|jcmax: On this hand, however, it could have worked well. W would have rebid 1NT and then if EW played a system where 2@C forces 2D they would have been there!|pg||
nt|roswolf: zia did a scissors coup in @C which is a pleasant sight to see|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed sabine|pg||

pc|s7|nt|jaapfr: 3@C on 3@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh|pg||
nt|pelu: better if Fantoni takes @CK also and force pd to play major - block the suit at get the setting trick|pg||
nt|rhelle: Muller had 2 options: 1NT to show @s, and 2@d non-forcing. What is best here?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|hedyg: on bd 11 where Jonsson played 3NT= OR played 2@H +2|pg||

nt|jaapfr: Bob playing his own version:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well i think a shift was clear. only question whether spades or diamonds, and N card shd be SP|pg||
nt|hedyg: Welland just bid 4@H, not 4@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: while Jansma (S) showed his @ss|pg||
mc|8|nt|marlowepi: i think 2D better with a stiff heart, closer decision with a doubleton heart|pg||
nt|hedyg: he did not make this|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I know...|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely 1NT was down|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: has NO entries to hand outside where pard may have|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: De Wijs could have bid 3@H with force in @H|pg||
nt|rhelle: Is it that lucky? looks like a @d dropping or the @c finesse right|pg||
nt|pelu: need @H lead to defeat 3NT - 4@d+4@s + @cA - |pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: great auction though contract needs luck to make|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: here W has no space to explore so 3NT does not necessarily show great strength in @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs less luck now|pg||
nt|rhelle: and with the opening in North (sound openings) that looks pretty likely|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rhelle: looks well within the 35% or so range you need to bid a vulnerable game|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure how the spade lead means less luck. it didnt tell E anything he didnt already know, and meanwhile it compromises his options|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|pelu: if making 180/ 200 in 3@C - so best for S to pass - and hope|pg||

mb|2S|mb|d|nt|roswolf: title|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|henryb:  It looks like E-W can make 6@d with good guessing shoes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: in my youthful days i would always look for slam on these kind of hands|pg||
nt|daman: 6@D would have been a challenge|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: didnt find or make many of them though!|pg||
nt|jcmax: And how exactly would you reach 6@D here?|pg||
nt|daman: with great skill Sabine :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Well, I don't know. |pg||
nt|jcmax: There isn't really much to the play here as we can see. But declarer is worried about trumps being 5-1, which would complicate matters.|pg||
nt|daman: he has 10 toppers   what would we do at MPs?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well in my youth i would have bid a new suit which would guarantee at least 3card supportfor openers suit- unsound method though it is -|pg||
nt|jaapfr: is long ago:)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|jcmax: If @D are 4-1, the 4-card suit would most likely be with S, and it would not be a problem to finesse against the J|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|h4|nt|henryb:  What is Welland's plan?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb @DA and @DK and the a finesse if needed|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is a strange line|pg||
nt|jcmax: As South did not unblock the @SK, declarer will assume that @S are blocked. and there will be an extra chance with @H5-1, if he guesses @C correctly|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|h8|nt|daman: we might all have played this differently|pg||

nt|roswolf: efforts looked so childish and i wonder how i actually improved to my present standard - i think my pards would challenge that assertion!!!!|pg||
nt|jcmax: The last bad thing that could happen at this point is, if N had Jxxx in @D, but then he would have a singleton @C, which is unlikely. Unless he jumped on a 5-card @S-suit of ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: course.|pg||

nt|april7: then only 7 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem can be that East cant be sure that pd has a 6 card @D|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 card @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: double by W is not penalty, asks pd to bid on|pg||
nt|hedyg: well so much for playing 4@h..|pg||
nt|hedyg: Welland bid 4@H with 3 cards over 3@s|pg||
mb|4N|nt|kiwibridge: and 11pm New Zealand, yes folks I'll be here for another set|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: courage bid 2@H imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: is it? he passed 1@H so doesnt promise anything but fit|pg||

nt|jaapfr: I|pg||
nt|hedyg: thanks to our specs for joining and your helpful comments. we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
mb|5C|nt|hedyg: we will be back after a short break|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: we've seen 83 imps traded evenly in 15 boards so not tight bridge but good all the same|pg||
nt|pelu: this last board cost the sensation :OR are ahead of us now :(:(|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|hedyg: oh :( lost the miracle!|pg||
nt|hedyg: all eyes on Muller|pg||
nt|pelu: we have to do a better job next time, Hedy, :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes we do :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: but this way we get the specs from the OR !|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The commentators were fast, that helped|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes our fault, sorry |pg||
nt|pelu: West has by his X sjown extra values, and Muller has a lot of fine controls - so he is close to 6@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has also already bid 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: yes - thats pro and contra - |pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed|pg||
nt|pelu: take a coin|pg||
nt|hedyg: but that 4NT bid does show interest surely|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: Welland found a bid over the 1@H opening and then of course hard to stop Zia|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a very good thing to see was the concentrated tight correct bridge of all (so wd EW:)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
