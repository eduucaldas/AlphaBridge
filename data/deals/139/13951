mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|jtr: 2@s might be ok in a 2/1 context|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jtr: Now South has a tough bid|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|jtr: Retreat to 3NT quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: definitely 2S if available, to begin showing shape|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|nt|jtr: It should show extras though and North's hand only just has them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is a potential problem if N is not allowed to bid 2S. how would S know when N next bids 3S whether N has a D stopper. auction goies better if N can just bid out shape|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess @hA then run the 10 is best even though i can see that it works|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes true but dont you think it should show better than a minimum?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think S will release the only entry back to the top clubs|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe N/S dont play 2/1 though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as you said, in a strict 2/1 context there is no need for 2S to show any extras. the auction is already GF, so better to bid out shape ASAP to help partner judge. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes they may not|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jtr: George Mittleman points out that running the 10 immediately is best to retain the entry|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|jtr: They do play 2/1 i am told|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right that is what i was saying|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|jtr: ah right sorry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but even playing heart ten can lead to troub le|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|jtr: @c lead worked well actually|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: since u need to establish tricks elsewhere|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: i think winning D ace was an error|pg||
nt|jtr: Running the 10 also has potential problems if East switches to a @s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: retain AJ behind Q has to be good, and it looks from the lead of the king (rather than to it or from it) that S wants someone to win the ace, probably for entry reasons|pg||

nt|jtr: How does West know to continue @cs?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: these guys love to win their aces from AJx instead of retaining a tenace position over declarer or dummy:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes they seem to play that|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe he wanted to continue @cs whilst partner has the @s entry?|pg||

pc|sK|nt|april7: E will play 4@H and should actually make it,losing only 1 @C and probably 2 @H,due to good position of K and when he drops the Q of @H then for sure of @C|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzkm: what about getting too short in trumps after some @ds|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|april7: to pass 2@H with 4 1/2 losers ,its not understandable|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you take the club hook first or play another suit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy for me to ask club hook, seeing all 4 hands |pg||

nt|marlowepi: holding was not attractive to lead from|pg||
nt|jtr: True|pg||
nt|jtr: Many ways of defending against this|pg||
nt|jtr: Using 3m as take out|pg||

nt|sybarra: not my style but perhaps others |pg||
nt|yuval10: not mine either|pg||
mb|4H|nt|april7: @D is best lead though|pg||

nt|vugraphzkm: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/bgt_2010/10_05_14_wer.html try again pls|pg||
nt|april7: must make ruffing finesse in @S and I see only 9 tricks|pg||

nt|sybarra: in the post mortem |pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: N under the screen, saying, that S could have defeated the 4@hs earlier this match|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|xenya: indeed, looks very odd|pg||
mb|4S|nt|april7: gameforce|pg||
nt|yuval10: probably by ducking @h|pg||

pc|d5|nt|april7: in CR only 2@C after 1NT|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|xenya: with 3-2 @Cs and @CK on, 11 tricks are easy -- declarer is trying to cater for some other distribution|pg||
nt|sybarra: club may get ruffed now |pg||
nt|sybarra: but contract is safe enough |pg||

mb|d|mb|1N|an|both minors|nt|marlowepi: colors right, Losing Trick Count right, you have an easy rebid, and you get to bid the suit you want led. true that 1C is not natural, but if in doubt E will tend to lead one|pg||
