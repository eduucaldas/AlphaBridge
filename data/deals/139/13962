mb|r|mb|2S|nt|lilac9: eleven tricks look easy for east|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: this is surely favourite to make..|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|nt|wilkinsona: so sound bidding to 3NT this hand..|pg||
nt|iain sime: On a heart lead this makes six clubs and three aces. |pg||
nt|patricck: But why would you lead a heart on this auction?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Going back to totally old fashioned methods then 2@S is best --after all it is not a race |pg||
pc|s7|nt|patricck: OK, so what would I know :) |pg||
pc|s2|nt|wilkinsona: why not, seems a good bet|pg||
nt|galadriel: If you play short suit game tries, do you think the N hand is worth one?|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, at least its a GF|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: as OUtred are +420 here|pg||
pc|d7|nt|garnetts: On this hand I would rather chew my own arm off than bid opposite a passed partner|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: here, having seen Clive's 2 heart bid on an earlier hand, perhaps 3 spades a pushy bid|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|lilac9: and club queen of course|pg||
nt|iain sime: No attractive alternative.|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|patricck: Am I missing something? Why is a @D not a possibility?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lark20: especially with such a flat hand|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but once again partnership understandings are vital..|pg||
nt|garnetts: a trump lead anyone?  |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I am sure John expected 5 spades..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: doesnt seem to be on the movie how this was knocked in other room|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h4|nt|wilkinsona: well John Holland moved, but perhaps he is more sure of the 2 heart bid|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|galadriel: Yes, it was a club lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: spec suggests a mis guess in the heart suit|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|garnetts: well he didn't have that last time |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi Murry|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
mc|10|nt|wilkinsona: true, but why not 2 hearts...with 44|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: perhaps David cosidered leading the king..|pg||
nt|galadriel: then declarer played a small heart up ducked by S to the ten in N hand|pg||

nt|galadriel: Match even closer now|pg||
nt|mr murray: Hi everyone|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lilac9: four hearts is not a piece of cake |pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: Yes, a @D was led at the other table. Once in a while East will bid 3NT without a diamond stop and you pay off. |pg||
nt|garnetts: 1NT to protect maybe |pg||
nt|patricck: a little too thin for me|pg||
nt|lark20: esp vul|pg||
nt|garnetts: well can hardly have much more if you have passed |pg||
nt|garnetts: partner could have somewhat more than they have |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes but 1 diamond may not be the best EW contract|pg||
nt|patricck: you might have some 10s and 9s and have some honours in your 4 card suit tho|pg||
nt|mr murray: seems like a pretty quiet 4 heart contract. |pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk1: The team names are reversed on the scoreboard I'm afraid. No way we can change that now, has to wait until the second stanza. Iain, could you keep track, please?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: if you reopen and oppo bid & make 4 hearts, not so good|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree about 1@D not being the best contract when maybe partner has 4/5 and is fixed--but then you might miss a game |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|mr murray: good time for a coffee break.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|iain sime: ok.|pg||
nt|Walddk1: ty|pg||
pc|d4|nt|garnetts: Most easts these days would bid on junk anyway |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|lilac9: and east gets to play|pg||
nt|lilac9: interesting|pg||
nt|galadriel: This could go down|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Holland seemed to make that 4 hearts by ruffing his 4th diamond in dummy, so maybe it can go down...|pg||
nt|galadriel: You just got here and now you are taking a break?? :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcwla: S will have to do some good guessing here after W ducks the @SJ return.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|wilkinsona: 12 trick possible now..|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|galadriel: W must duck this @S|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c4|pc|h4|nt|galadriel: Now dificult to get this right for declarer|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: same auction in both rooms...|pg||
nt|galadriel: he will probably play for the drop|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|jcwla: W has the @S length so needs some reason to put W on @C length also.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: further he got good breaks in 2 side suits to do it so maybe its not so good a contract|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|iain sime: Clive ran the heart to his jack trusting Les Steel to have led an honest card- can be a dangerous course as many of us have found to our cost over the years.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and some players open 1 d with a strong distribtional hand thinking "this will not be passed out"|pg||
nt|garnetts: You have a better case over 1@C |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: nobody looking to play in clubs|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|h5|nt|galadriel: I think it's very interesting whether you can make short suit or long suit tries after major raises - it's good to be able to do both|pg||

nt|patricck: If your suit is really bad then you need a few more points to justify having to get involved|pg||
nt|galadriel: yes, well done|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: can it make tho... point needed for STEEL|pg||

pc|cA|nt|garnetts: South should lead a minor |pg||

nt|patricck: 1@S here is hardly pre-emptive...there might be more argument for it if we were calling over a 1@C opener|pg||
nt|garnetts: I still bid it because if it goes say pass from me and 4@H gets back to me I wish I had bid |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: that singleton 10 looks important|pg||
nt|garnetts: The defensive values and second suit make it OK in my view|pg||

pc|c3|pc|s3|pg||

pc|h4|nt|wilkinsona: seems right, though intervention aided the auction elsewhere|pg||
nt|patricck: yes a 5 card suit with the109 in the long suit make it a hefty hand to be valued at just 15-17|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: all guesses seem to work|pg||
nt|garnetts: choose between playing for the A@H to be right ot the @D finesse |pg||

nt|patricck: yes, I thought NS might regret not doubling 4C. Very frustrating to beat the oppontns 4 tricks vulnerable and lose on the board (board 16)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: when I was off air, there was talk of 4 hearts on 15, but when this was tried oppo accurately lead trumps to scupper that|pg||
nt|Walddk1: south better conceal his d king or spade king a goner, says Victor Silverstone|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well perhaps this can go down..|pg||
nt|galadriel: methinks E will get the @S right now|pg||
nt|mr murray: tghink lead gives away the spade suit|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcwla: Yeah, it's more of an overcall (or as here a responding hand).|pg||
nt|galadriel: When John Holland opened the N hand, his partner nearly got excited :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|mr murray: not that he has lotsof choices|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|jtr: Getting the @h count|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jtr: Not that it seems to help much|pg||
pc|cT|nt|garnetts: I also probably pass 2@H though |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|jallerton: why is that important?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: still can go off|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Can get 7 here with some luck, but is it now?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: That would at least make board 14 very exciting|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|yr: it has been a professional performance by data steel, but lets not forget the amazing fightback that solox have staged to reach the final|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jtr: He is trying to eliminate|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Bye bye, but declarer still has two hearts to lose|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Unless the defence blocks them|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d4|pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jallerton: @dQ now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: TGR's running scores round 8, halftime: de Botton vs Dhondy 53-13 ; Scerri vs LNWers 51-13; OMC vs TGRs 9-13 ;Teltscher vs Cardtossers 47-14|pg||
nt|mr murray: still should lose 2 hearts unless South stays awake and unblocks jack|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Even that does not matter|pg||
nt|Walddk1: But well done to David Walker anyway|pg||
nt|mr murray: he could have ruffed out minors|pg||
mc|9|nt|jallerton: that will put de Botton in the lead if the scores stay the same|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so last board..|pg||

nt|mdgraham: it would be nicer to have all teams playing the same boards, though|pg||

nt|jallerton: same in most midweek leagues round the country, which are usually played at people's houses|pg||
nt|patricck: Indeed it was a good contract, but with @H 3-0 the defence really wasn't too difficult to beat it|pg||
nt|lark20: A diamond slam seems possible|pg||

nt|Walddk1: Is there a chance to defeat 3NT?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ehsana: played in the wrong  major but survived|pg||
nt|Walddk1: or maybe they'll play somewhere else|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: 1@s = 5+@H|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4 hearts decent on 16 too imo|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphzks: ofcourse with a little help from defence|pg||
nt|lark20: sorry talking about the wrong board|pg||
nt|garnetts: OK   not a good slam on this one then :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|yr: so they need a 19 imp swing on this partscore deal to win, impossible:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|jallerton: 2@d = good @h raise|pg||
nt|jtr: Missed an easy game:)|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Last board now. Many thanks to Stephen, our very competent operator in Edinburgh|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|yr: great performance by both the finalists, & the team which held its nerve emerges as the national champions of 2010|pg||
nt|patricck: collecting 800, 1100 or even 1400 would be better than making a non vul 4@H tho|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: specs say declarer played well after club lead OR|pg||
mb|3S|nt|wilkinsona: wondered what you folk were talking about..|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Thanks Jordan|pg||
nt|jcwla: 9 hands in NT, 5 in @S's, 2 in @H's.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Dont like the system at all if they cant reach 4@h|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: you talk from experiance, patrick|pg||
nt|mr murray: seems no place but n/t feasible|pg||
nt|Walddk1: and to our excellent commentators, Anne, Tony and Murray|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|patricck: meanwhile this looks like a push result. 4@S a reasonable contract but needed some of the trumps onside|pg||
nt|iain sime: This is an unlucky 4@S bid in both rooms. So Steel has an 11 imp lead (scores reversed on scoresheet). |pg||
nt|garnetts: easier if the first bid is 1@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|yr: they will represent pakistan in the commonwealth games schedualed later this year in new dehli India|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: thank you.|pg||

nt|Walddk1: Finally, our gratitude to the Scottish Bridge Union for ensuring that this cup final was brought to BBO vugraph. Greatly appreciated by bridge fans all over the world|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jallerton: South (or North) might have doubled 2@h|pg||

nt|galadriel: Once again Steel showing more aggression by Xing 1NT|pg||

nt|galadriel: Looks like 6@S will make but unlikely to be bid|pg||

nt|vugraphzgu: http://www.scottishbridge.co.uk/|pg||

nt|patricck: seems like a fairly routine 4@S to start with this time|pg||
nt|patricck: 2@H?|pg||

mb|1S|nt|jallerton: can N/S stop out og game?|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: quiet pass from Walker|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|jtr: Did well to stop, sort of, at the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: @H and a minor|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: I assume all balanced hands are opened 1@C by the N-S pair in the closed room|pg||
nt|patricck: certainly frisky, even at the vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: yes, it's a shame South opened a non-systemic 1@C|pg||
nt|patricck: N/S can do very well in hearts, but difficult to know which one of them was supposed to enter the auction|pg||
nt|iain sime: North South have missed a decent 4@H here.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Oh, is it|pg||
nt|galadriel: A bit West of Falkirk - Kilsyth|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: East is her husband Charles|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: trump lead sort of marked here|pg||
nt|jtr: Some open 1@c on any balanced hand|pg||
nt|jtr: But not this pair it seems?|pg||
nt|jallerton: no, both N/S pairs systemically open 1@D with 4|pg||
nt|jtr: My style too|pg||
nt|jallerton: at this stable, East seems to have bid some of North's hand|pg||
nt|patricck: 3 rounds of trumps stops 4@H I think|pg||
nt|iain sime: It looks like that means only five hearts and four tricks in the minors, but wheer there is nine a tenth often appears.|pg||
nt|galadriel: EW have complex methods they have mainly devised themselves, but their NT is 14-16|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: my favourate spec says 6 spades good here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..but he is now qualifying his comment if there is a club lead..|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|galadriel: That must be a slam try|pg||
mb|4D|nt|wilkinsona: sure, but having done it and struck gold, passing 3 clubs fails to put the pressure on|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have always thought that the sort of intervention by west is well worth the risk--I suspect the problem is that East did not bid enough--anyone for 3NT and not 3@C |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: declrer may read this lead as a singleton|pg||
nt|patricck: Going up with the A@H will make declarer's task a lot harder|pg||
nt|garnetts: This has all the hallmarks of playing badly if it is a singleton--so probably worth the risk it isn't|pg||
nt|patricck: But can he really play low? I wouldn't have thought so|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: north taking his time..as well he might as the lines are not clear|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I think it is worth the risk |pg||
nt|patricck: well done|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Pros and cons. The advantage of opening 1@C on 2+ is that 1@D is 5+ unless 4441|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks like they are going there..|pg||
nt|galadriel: Not sure about this auction - why did S not cue bid 4@C I wonder|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..how decisive will this board be?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Beryl Campbell|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi Beryl|pg||
nt|lark20: Hi all|pg||
nt|patricck: Welcome Beryl :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: "transferred king" with an opponent is a new concept|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: if south opens, hard to stay out of perhaps|pg||
nt|galadriel: Any ideas about the auction Stephen?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: les puzzled by lack of @C cue|pg||
nt|galadriel: Oh ok - so was I :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: is puzzled polite?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: 2NT = any shortage: 3@S shows @H shortage|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|iain sime: Bidding 4@H might have stampeded East into 5@C minus one. |pg||
pc|dT|nt|jtr: Makes a change, he usually bids both opponents cards|pg||

mb|p|nt|iain sime: John Holland is a current English international from Manchhester. Clive owen is also English from Darlington.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: arrangements after a reverse come in to play|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anne must be right - and as so many hands it's a race to 1NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: sry - yes|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jtr: Hmmm  Struggling with that|pg||
nt|galadriel: Ok :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: That is in my view a dreadful bid |pg||
nt|lark20: Oh dear!|pg||
mb|p|nt|lilac9: 3c here looks like a good limit raise in hearts|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...in these situations the club suit is back in the pack..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, I believe Vi 's second name started as Mitchell|pg||
nt|jcwla: The 1@H a transfer to @S's?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: It must be western Turkish i think|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jallerton: Garvey could be struggling in 1@sx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I wonder why Hinden did not sit for it in the other room|pg||
nt|jtr: Taking some cash here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Perfect vulnerability to pass|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: persumably a spot of Equal level conversion there|pg||
pc|s2|nt|iain sime: I wouldn't like to predict the outcome- Steel are probably slight favourites.|pg||
nt|patricck: Its an unusual situation, but West should have had enough confidence in what partner would need to make that bid. He should have passed 2@S|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|galadriel: I think E is very lucky to find partner with such good @H support|pg||
pc|s9|nt|wilkinsona: there must be a forcing way of showing support|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jtr: Yes i was thinking that before the Turkish element crept in|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S first is perhaps best after 2@D--then say east bids 3NT which likely shows a 5-4-2-2 hand then 4@C seems right|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: risky x then|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: yes small singleton and a double would have been more fitting |pg||
pc|sA|nt|jallerton: in other room, rdbl showed 4+@h, dbl was support, showing 3 hearts|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d6|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: i meant single @H in dummy and double from S|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: Yes, and ... ?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: It still seems normal to convert|pg||
nt|jallerton: I agree, I would have passed too|pg||
nt|jtr: It translates as "Special systems to improve" apparently|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you can make 3NT, they will go for a phone number|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|lark20: Holland couldn't have done any more.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|galadriel: yes, indeed|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: it's one of the reasons why you redouble in the first place|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, phone numbers used to be shorter|pg||
nt|jallerton: but this may only be 1 off in fact|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT is just awful--maybe say the same hand in the majots with xxx and xx in the minors|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Hello Anne, Tony and Stephen|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: hello Wald|pg||
nt|galadriel: Hi Roland|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|iain sime: Yes, this is not agreat contract and could go down several.|pg||
nt|patricck: I'm thinking that North should have got a red card out for 4@C...  How likely is it that E/W could make anything at the 4 level when the clubs are clearly placed the way they are|pg||
nt|iain sime: Again it is interesting to speculate how many hearts NS would have made.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lilac9: slick defense here|pg||
nt|lilac9: declarer saves the day by playing another trump|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|s4|nt|jallerton: the clubs were developable to the @d lead did not cost a trick|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|c5|nt|iain sime: A diamond now is best|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|garnetts: I also agree with you Tony 3@C is best if it is forcing |pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|jtr: They say to always lead trumps against a doubled part-score|pg||
nt|jtr: But North maybe knows better|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h8|nt|wilkinsona: (Im practicing using surnames)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d8|pc|sT|pc|c8|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Excellent Mr Wilkinson|pg||
nt|galadriel: North may be a little unhappy with the defence|pg||
