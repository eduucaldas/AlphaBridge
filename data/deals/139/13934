nt|jaapfr: are EW female students:)?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Also part of the explanation why when it's not clear who owns the hand or who can make what, the 5 level belongs to the opponents.|pg||
nt|lestergold: why do i call you Frank it should be Rodal its psychological sorry|pg||
nt|jaheim: strange 6 sp with only K8xx in @S|pg||

nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: A hard one from W but I belive Erik will bid. But will they reach 4?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jaheim: another @S contract,  better trumph this time  :)|pg||
nt|stoffers: instead of 2nt eliassen could have bid 4@h maybe?'|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4 @H/@S EW same losers.|pg||
nt|jaheim: How many @d will Bremset bid?|pg||
nt|jaheim: 3 or 4?|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|rodal f: Or a auto stop at 2@H?|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h should make |pg||
nt|rodal f: Looks as Ekrens 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: it is |pg||
nt|jaheim: but 9 tricks max|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - 8 to be exact - both ways|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sharkey: A rarity - a weak 2@D opener|pg||
nt|sharkey: the previous board was down 2 - not 1 - will be corrected|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to find A@c and Q@c lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: good vuln save|pg||
nt|andyv:  down at least 500|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx Torstein:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes they may stretch too far on this one too|pg||
nt|djneill: how many @s now, shirley?|pg||
nt|djneill: 2@s, 3@s seem the options|pg||
nt|stoffers: vulnerable thats a big 2@s i think...but when finding partner with a 6 card fit...no problem|pg||
nt|jaheim: chicken|pg||
nt|jaheim: :)|pg||
mb|d!|nt|rodal f: This contract is playable by a dobble hook in @C|pg||
nt|hagz: 3 NT makes, 6 @c makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: looks reasonable - unless the 4-1 @H break becomes a problem|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here is a good example of a hand that natural bidders should open 1@D.|pg||
nt|larsarthur: south is not sure about @dfit|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Marshall Lewis|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hi all :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Must be prepared for all continuations -- here, 1@D and then 3@C and you feel much better than this.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@c seems a better contract ironically|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Vul cannot take a chance.|pg||
nt|jaheim: 1@s shows 4@s and 4+@h|pg||
mb|3H|nt|andyv:  now it's serious:)|pg||
nt|larsarthur: lowest 4-card is std in Norway|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Marshalll.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A spec asked why Harstad havn't been at BBO. They try to do there best and match 7 are not putted up. They told.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now 5@H+4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|hagz: Hard to guess @s in 3 NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Just one thing left to do! Bid the 6er....|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually isnt 3n a trick short on a heart lead?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sharkey: A @D lead appears to be best for defence|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S had only 4 losers imo|pg||
nt|jcwla: Interesting to know but that doesn't begin and end the conversation for me in terms of how best to describe this hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Anders Kristensen and GeO Tislevoll (partly)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Running scores at  http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1074140R|pg||
nt|djneill: thanks Geir Harnes, who says East is a cousin of Geir Helgemo|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wander what's gona happen in OR at this? |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: there are arguments on both sides, but you aren;lt getting full value for money out of sputnik if you follow the same sequence with this S hand and also on   xx  AKx   xx  Axxxxx|pg||
nt|james_h: tricky rebid in normal systems for south, no such difficulty here 1@s must be 5?|pg||
nt|rv: 1@s possibly shows 5@s here|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi folks!|pg||
nt|geot: Hi friends:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 1 spade was not forcing|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Andres, wlc|pg||
nt|james_h: Hi Geo|pg||
nt|djneill: 3@s shows an unbalanced hand typically, but occasionally 4522 - East has a sharp hand, so at IMPs the idea is to just bid game and hope to make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice name to have going into competition |pg||
nt|djneill: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  on @s lead, can N still hold it down to only 4 losers?|pg||
nt|andyv:  without dbl dummying the @c suit?|pg||
nt|james_h: Hi Anders|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: If any want to look at the pairs systemcards u find them here: http://www.nmlag.com/Systemkort til the turney is fin|pg||
nt|jcwla: When the clubs are significantly stronger or you will be able to handle all continuations, I have no problem with 1@C.  Here, a rebid problem such as this was reasonably likely.|pg||
nt|hagz: yeah, there is only one entrance the the dummy to get the @s tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This might have - regarding the bidding - about 7Â½ % chance to make|pg||
nt|rnmalik: but for 8@H this hand has all the possibilities of making 6:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: i suppose 2d sgowing i assume 4 spades might pick them|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant be done really |pg||
nt|hagz: Can't get them|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to make a decision as to how to tackle the diamonds|pg||

pc|d3|nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||

nt|rodal f: Belive this will end -3 and 150 while NS have 10 in @S. So 1 or 10 IMP gain for Singsås it seems.|pg||

nt|andersk: lets see if Hjelmeland can male this|pg||

pc|s3|nt|sharkey: Not many use weak 2@D opener - I believe it sometimes is very effective|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway -500 not too bad for NS:)|pg||
nt|djneill: there is a general rule that against 3-suiters, you want to lead trumps - it is just a rule that works - and West has a semi-3suited hand, so South's trump switch was reasonable|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  true|pg||

pc|c7|nt|jaapfr: -200 or even -300 to punish W for his 2nt bd|pg||
nt|andyv:  I like when I raise my partner's suit and he/she finds another suit to lead.|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all sorry I am late |pg||
nt|andyv:  never to late, Shirley:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi Shirley|pg||
nt|rodal f: No minisplinter on for NS it seems, but then S would have signed off anyway.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 tricks with this lead.|pg||
nt|jaheim: it looks like 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sharkey: no - sunny Stavanger :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect if D were Kxx and clubs KQxx, he would have been more likely to open|pg||
nt|djneill: ok @h lead which gives up the suit, but if South ducks, there goes the entry to the @c, so South should rise with the @hA|pg||
nt|djneill: @c behave, so 10 tops - 6@c, 2@h, 1@s, 1@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: can not get greedy on this hand |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|larsarthur: probably|pg||
nt|anton72: Hi ... thx ...just was wondered who was explained 2 NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Brb 3-4 min|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  too:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i dislike 2nt bid W|pg||
nt|andyv:  because of 3rd seat opener, S was not tempted to dbl opps into game|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree with u Mike. A invit would have been normal.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rodal f: OK. So nice weather there two:) Welcome back home.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  I don't mind it... W is a passed hand and can expect a bit better @c suit than pd put down|pg||
nt|jcwla: Pass seems normal on the actual hand, though reasonable intermediates and medium spots make it look not totally watered-down.|pg||
nt|andersk: still 4 matches to go, and a long way to go, so medal is still possible if we improve!|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I second that; I have been in that position too often for comfort|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once again it may be systemic, but i am not keen on the sequence chosen by E here. Even facing a PH, this E hand has significant game potential in a suit, so i would want to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maximize our opportunities to show suits|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 20 HCP and 4 card support for pard, e will be disappointed there is no Grand slam|pg||
nt|james_h: I do sometimes do in the last segment of the Bermuda Bowl when 16+ behind|pg||
nt|rv: @C lead and @d switch required to beat this which is double dummy defebse|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzkn: V, but there also seems to be a wrong explenation so we will see.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sharkey: been here a while now - only leave during cold season...|pg||
nt|jaheim: Flått is prob thinking about the Q of @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: They picked up the cards wrong so Flått opened in 1 heart. All bids alerted after 1 heart.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s what I doÂ´nt like with 2 NT - how many @H has West - you never know|pg||
nt|rv: normal @d lead should result in 10 tricks|pg||
nt|andersk: When all 5 players have been under pari, it is not easy. The easy part is that we cant blame any but ouhrselves:)|pg||
nt|djneill: yes, only way for more than 10 is if opponents pitch hearts and spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or Christer?|pg||
nt|jaheim: but always afraid of @c 5-3|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rv: Anders, are the top Norwegian pairs like Helgemo-Helness, Grotheim-Tundal, Brogeland-pd playing this event?|pg||
nt|andersk: No|pg||
nt|andersk: They are not qualyfied (Im not sure if they played from start)|pg||
nt|james_h: and Geo has gone south for the Spring|pg||
nt|geot: :)|pg||
nt|andersk: This event is played like 6 rounds of knockout matches, then 8 teams meet for a final long weekend|pg||
nt|james_h: and NZ dollars :)|pg||
nt|geot: he he|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rv: ok, still presume quality of bridge on display is quite high|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hawe45:  Perfect|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rodal f: LOL:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and pray clubs behave|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkey: cannot see any possibility of this making - but have a poor track record in predicting....|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he has picked the hearts well|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  question really is if E should leave the 2N bid in|pg||
nt|jaapfr: good question imo:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 6NT to guard the @S tenace|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|jcwla: Eh la la.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jaheim: big question @s 3-3? or @c 5-3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jaapfr: but 3@C will get a X by S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: although i still like 3@C by E|pg||
nt|lestergold: can make 3N on this line|pg||
nt|jaheim: soon  next board  zzzzzzzz|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|djneill: South is pressurizing E-W with the long suit - sometimes odd things happen|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to play safe tho to ensure 1N|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  I like 3@c just to keep my partners happy|pg||
nt|jaheim: winning line|pg||
pc|h6|pc|cT|nt|jaapfr: :)|pg||
nt|james_h: my experience is that there is great strength in depth in Norge|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|anton72: not so clear line to bid 4 @s ...so I think can be 2 VP from result after match|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h5|pc|c5|pc|s8|pg||
nt|jcwla: I agree with you, Marshall -- I don't think some of these 1@C openings give enough thought to the rebid.|pg||
mc|9|nt|vugraphzkn: we have to reset the tables brb|pg||
nt|larsarthur: ok|pg||
nt|jcwla: The @D plays just way too helpful here.|pg||
nt|jcwla: E also made a really nice play in @H's at T2.|pg||

nt|vugraphzbv: break time|pg||
nt|vugraphzbv: we can take the time to observe that the title likely will be a two-way battle between namsos and vikersund|pg||
nt|vugraphzbv: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1074140R|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 2N bid by N denied 3@s (if 2@h was inquiry) but seemed pretty aggressive holding Qx in @hs|pg||
pg||
qx|c20|st||md|2SKJ8643HKTD5CAQJ5,SAQ7HJ7654D872C87,ST9HQ8DKQJ96CK943,S52HA932DAT43CT62|sv|b|nt|rodal f: Any fun to come here from EW?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: N diddent see pds 1nt opening|pg||
nt|andersk: top 8 club teams, this year:)|pg||
nt|stoffers: was out getting food, question was?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: partial here may be 3@C for NS.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I think e/w will try 4 @S here at the end of the day |pg||
nt|jaapfr: still   Studentenes sounds very female to me but do not master Norwegian|pg||
nt|andyv:  S took a far more aggressive stance on board 1 and found the excellent save of 5@d for 9 imp gain|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR|pg||
nt|rv: so quality of bridge on display should definitely be of high standard|pg||
nt|djneill: that @h suit was an example of keeping the final contract in sight, and not mechanically play the suit by itself |pg||
mb|1D|nt|sharkey: On Board 1 Studentenes have picked up 11 IMPs - not 10.  6@S at this table was off 2.  This will be corrected|pg||
nt|rodal f: By his 9HP Forfot ain't fare away for a normalopening.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Shud be some action here?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: 3@C some kind of mixed raise?|pg||
nt|jcwla: N must be thinking it's a pinochle deck.|pg||
nt|rodal f: So by the screens N are same blind I am witout screens?:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah that explains |pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: funny faces in here :-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: So far NS have not been able to introduce their @D suit - may be too late now|pg||
nt|sybarra: or will E venture 3 nt at some point |pg||
nt|andyv:  actually N deserves the credit for dbling 4@s|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|rodal f: At board 2 OR are on there way for 6@S. 4@H splinter at W so fare|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: West opens a feather light vulnerable 1@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Rekstad originally played for another Topbridge team but lost to Vikersund in the 3d knockout match. He is hungry for revenge.|pg||
nt|stoffers:  i use it, some dont. I'm quitting it soon, going over to invitational bids directly instead 1@s-3@h invitational and @h :)|pg||
mb|2H|an|4th suit|nt|andersk: we also have another team event plaing like a premier leuage, two 2. divisjons 8 3. divisjons etc, premier leuage is the top team event, this is the top club team event|pg||
nt|rv: do EW play standard or a limited system?|pg||
nt|james_h: Any kibs have outline system info?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 5-5-4-2 with transfers after 1cl openings|pg||
nt|djneill: unsupported Queen and Jack are dubious|pg||
nt|anton72: trum lead beat it|pg||
nt|jaheim: how can u stop Bremset with 14 points?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: south cannot make anything at the 3 level|pg||
nt|sybarra: but its a good hand! |pg||
nt|rodal f: 6@S came at board 2 OR. So a swing it magistern.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can end up in 3NT also but that would be a bad contract on @H lead.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sharkey: Kib informs 3@C asks for strength and suit quality|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6!@S probably down 1 although 5@S likely to be +1|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3 NT shows max|pg||
nt|rodal f: U have the funniest any way Torstein:) I will come to Ålesund tomorrow non. Will be nice to see u again.|pg||
nt|djneill: you like the long @d suit shirley?  looks nice|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6/4 with spades |pg||
nt|mcarroll: not quite a Roland 19-21 and it looks like the 19 count wins|pg||
nt|djneill: welcome martin|pg||
nt|jaheim: 4@s best contract but............ will go down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes-they have 9 tricks at @S contract.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzkn: NS precision club|pg||
nt|andersk: normally there are 5-8 very good teams in this team final, some years the level is not abselout top|pg||
nt|geot: The nightmare for Førde seems to continue. The 4@S North went down in here (board 18) was played in 4@H at the other table, won by Cantona Nybo. 13 impsmore|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Dan, Shirley|pg||
nt|djneill: ok so another entry-related hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|stoffers: no 3@c in passoutseat?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: so wise of NS to stay out of the bidding as appears 5@D x wud be off 800|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: good leading technique|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rv: par contract is 5@d for EW though 4@s makes as well|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like PA is trying to play 4@S |pg||
pc|h8|nt|geot: In 5@D you have to guess the trumps|pg||
nt|james_h: another reason to take the normal line|pg||
nt|djneill: pretty much no way to get to the @d so East must duck a @d, even if South covers|pg||
nt|stoffers: -1 now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would u have done at vul?|pg||
nt|stoffers: indeed..knowing opps have a 9 card fit, they will probabyly fight once more|pg||
nt|stoffers: and vul its 670, nv only 470|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive Allars will thing a bit more at safetyplay after the @HA. Hum|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Allard picks up a card in every suit in his hand. Not sure which route to take.|pg||
nt|rodal f: What would X from N be after 3@C. But hard to come with it if for pan..|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  W's 5@s bid asked for what?|pg||
nt|andyv:  club control or trump?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @S support i say|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi:) Normaly trumh cuality.|pg||
nt|andyv:  if so, then 6@s was optomistic by E|pg||
nt|rodal f: quality*|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even wrong bid E|pg||
nt|rv: how many brds per round, we seem to have started off with a huge score in favor or Namsos BK?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: as he does|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|jcwla: Will we get a failing @H finesse?|pg||
nt|geot: 16 boards|pg||
nt|andersk: 16 a round  32 a match|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: apparently systemic to open 1H on the W hand|pg||
pc|hT|nt|larsarthur: how can it fail?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: i predict 10 tricks - probably wrong again....|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: better claim down 1 to make dummy not too ashamed:)|pg||
nt|rv: East will pass and West will bid 5@d to deny first round control|pg||
pc|sT|nt|geot: So easy for us, seeing all cards.....to play the trumps without a loser. Not that easy at the table|pg||
nt|james_h: indeed|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|rv: if cue bid is doubled by opps, redouble shows first round control, bidding another suit shows cue in that suit and promises second round control of suit|pg||
nt|djneill: so South must think - is there a possible layout that gives us 3 more tricks outside of @d immediately|pg||
pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: if the EW carding is to be believed, the heart queen is with E|pg||
nt|andersk: might get the @D right now, since N doubled 5@C|pg||
nt|rodal f: b|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same contract at OR|pg||
nt|rodal f: And same lead. OR|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|rodal f: Mildly said. E is Erlend Skjetne fro the Norwegian Junior team older.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @S seemed a bit much in the first place|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
nt|djneill: maybe pd has the @sT|pg||
nt|sybarra: must have been something I said,  booted right out of the room |pg||

pc|dA|nt|djneill: oof|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sharkey: The students picked up another 6 IMPs on bd 2 when 3@D failed in OR|pg||
nt|rodal f: At board 2 EW went surpricing -1 at 3@D and 6IMP for the Students from Trondheim.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E would not respond 1S on a balanced 4-count vulnerab;le|pg||

nt|rodal f: 3@D now show some cards. If not lebensol 2NT as order for E to bid 3@C and 31D tell minimum hand at W|pg||
nt|stoffers: vulnerable, passed partner...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jaheim: my guess i mean|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcwla: Can still do it.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Back in a flash.|pg||
nt|stoffers: its different to show cards and have 100 honours in an unbid suit frank, i bid 4@d|pg||
nt|rodal f: A @H lead will come from N. But at 6@D it need to be the K for @C swich|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Eliassen finally alerts the bid and then alerts his head after:)|pg||
nt|stoffers: how can N lead a@h? :)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|djneill: lol, I try not to say anything when I put my dummy down - it tends to distract partner :-)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andyv:  and would still end up in 2@s:)|pg||
nt|larsarthur: well done!|pg||
nt|andersk: abselout supermax in North, still no chanse to make a game, can it be right?|pg||
nt|anton72: too many things are well placed .... they have only 23 hcp|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodal f: Style and deal I belive, but after the bids from W it seems correct. Or?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|rv: this is not the way to get back, you only slide further more often that:)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|larsarthur: :(|pg||
nt|james_h: I tend to go with all 9 hcp except flat with no 10's and 9's|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rodal f: You as many others would have done I belive. It's only a @C lead that keep them of 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|djneill: knowing the split - any singleton with East leaves 4 @d losers, North is not unhappy to let West ruff|pg||
nt|djneill: when West passes a 2-level takeout, it shows a stack|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ure right. Normal for many to take the @HK, but not for all.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  I see more of an advantage for DONT in direct seat... in pass out seat, something simpler might be better|pg||
nt|stoffers: how Rekstad can find his 4@h and 5@c bid i really dont understand|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|stoffers: partner has bid 3@d..he didnt act over 2@h,...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Eliassen shakes his head and mumbles to himself.|pg||
nt|stoffers: he cant be that good, and i would say he's got a strong maximum for his bidding so far|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: I often play a system in direct seat and natural in pass out seat (or landy only) |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|james_h: North is going through more mental anguish|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sharkey: Even with @C lead I believe slam makes as @D set up|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South was end-played in the lead - only one of three could beat 3 NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: and passing one levels can be even worse |pg||
nt|rodal f: The web side for the turney. U willfind all info u need there: http://www.nmlag.com/|pg||

nt|vugraphzkn: Cannot! He takes it directly in his arm. Would be messy..|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sybarra: better ruff |pg||
nt|stoffers: one deserved off, not that the 2@h bid deserves any plus either but..Maybe im being to critical here, but thats the way i feel for this hand right now|pg||

mb|d|nt|rodal f: At balancing. Not direct he said. Thx:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: north's 2 points are working very haARD INDEED|pg||
nt|djneill: ok in other room brd 2, same contract and defense, but East embarked on a total crossruff that was unlucky when North was short in @c - one trick short|pg||
nt|djneill: East had not tested the @h early, so did not know about that split|pg||
nt|jaheim: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: If I were in the NS position, its time to revert to A game and try to salvage pride and practise mental toughness|pg||
nt|james_h: no more swing manouevers|pg||
nt|rv: there are multiple issues with this strategy, a) you invariably lose whatever little chance you have of recovery b) you upset the field by donating IMPs and VPs to opps c) you will ...|pg||
nt|rv: lose your pride|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N should have led Q of diamonds, or at least the ten|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a view a punt hard to bid it accurately|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not to much info to find at there CC after 2@C opening: http://www.nmlag.com/var/fckeditor/nmlag/file/2010/Singsas/Systemkort%20Kare%20og%20Jan%20Emil.pdf|pg||
nt|lestergold: yje stiff hert is an obvious value to N but how can he know how imprtant the Q@c is?|pg||
nt|djneill: ok a 3crd @h raise - it is fine but takes a little judgement or gadgetry to then show that - I think requiring 4 cards is a reasonable agreement|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: S is being pragmatic opening the 5 card @S suit - this in order he'll be able to show both suits|pg||
nt|stoffers: 3nt was very nice, but diamonds dont behave, but in 4@h they do after this lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still Allard got it as he wanted, but don't know yet:)|pg||
nt|stoffers: best is to duck it around ofcource, then he will have trouble getting to thm later|pg||

nt|larsarthur: with only 3@s?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think south would have gone on that|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This is not going to be easy for EW|pg||

nt|rv: playing 2/1 style, most play 3@d as Invite and GF via 4th suit (2@h)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  2N usually an invite since you have 2@c and 3@c to show a variety of @s raises|pg||
nt|djneill: after 2 trumps, West knows there is no pt to playing a third and will get the @s ruff|pg||
nt|rodal f: As 3NT OR might also do. So a push?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45:  BUT: @D - and @S to the 10 (50-50) = SEVEN tricks|pg||

pc|d8|nt|rodal f: So too hard for u two Roland?:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wonder why not Andy. U have 2@C as the other posibillity for foring. What else could 2NT be? |pg||
nt|rodal f: Agreements:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  how about a balanced 12-13 hcp hand?|pg||
nt|andyv:  partner did overcall and you want to invite|pg||

pc|h4|nt|djneill: ok now West will make 5 on a black squeeze if North cashes a @d now|pg||
pc|d3|pc|hA|nt|sharkey: As expected Grand picked up IMPs on Bd 3 where EW let 3@H make|pg||
nt|rodal f: But all up to how strong the 2@D bid can be. It often use to be wide in Norway.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i dont think there is any harm in sp[lintering ion the way f u are prepared to jumop to 4 level in any case|pg||
nt|djneill: South must guard @s and @c|pg||
nt|djneill: and it plays like a double squeeze since the @d9 is a threat against North|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: fair bidding|pg||
nt|andyv:  so 3@d is a jump shift but not forcing for even one round?|pg||
nt|jbgood: one reason for the last hand may be that W's 2 hearts was either natural or forcing, or a weak hand with spade support. So 3 @h was faorcing, and E didnt find any better bid than 3 ...|pg||
nt|jbgood: @s .. ect|pg||

nt|vugraphzkn: 2 nt was stenberg|pg||

nt|marlowepi: W has a choice oer 1S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Best idea is to claim - |pg||
nt|rv: one of the reasons K/O matches are preferred in final stages of ACBL and World events is because of this strategy of teams not doing well playing anti-percentage bridge|pg||

nt|sharkey: Slam on a finesse|pg||
nt|rodal f: But will get 2 aces away by 4NT.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: useful for NS to play transfers in this situation|pg||
nt|sybarra: may hear screeching of brakes at both tables |pg||
nt|djneill: true, 3-4 support is more encouraging than 3crd after a checkback sequence|pg||
nt|djneill: North passed and South lost breath|pg||
nt|anton72: didnt saw W hand fully :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ended 3@H at E|pg||

nt|rodal f: Sr. S|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  agree, Hamdi... that's what makes this game so fascinating|pg||

nt|rodal f: But a interestin @C contract EW.|pg||
nt|rv: in Round Robin, teams not doing well can really upset the field by not playing seriously|pg||

nt|andersk: unbalanced GF|pg||
nt|james_h: 3?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|andyv:  W not elated with the dbl|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The defence to the Multi Two Diamonds is fundamentally different from the defence to a weak two for a number of reasons: |pg||
nt|andyv:  2N leb?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then can raise to 2S in two different ways, distinguishing pure obstruction from some genuine values|pg||
nt|djneill: some might open South's hand 2@c based on the large number of tricks, right?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes I think the S hand should use whatever forcing opening they use, I would open 2@C|pg||
nt|djneill: 2@c being a strong ART bid, for any poles|pg||
nt|anton72: nice spot ...120|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Simonsen needed a small break after the last one to reboot so we start again.|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: The direct defender always gets two opportunities to bid. |pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: A new gain for Vikersund|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  looks like it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The 4th seat defender usually gets two opportunities to bid.|pg||
nt|andersk: Maybe they dont play 2 NT as unbalanced GF|pg||
nt|rv: anyone for transfers on 1m-1n?|pg||
nt|james_h: I prefer 2n to 2@h|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very difficult to bid that and may only make on @S lead.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sharkey: Our excellent operator, Torstein Hesseberg, informs me the club is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year - also followed by a big tournement this fall|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not shure there|pg||
nt|larsarthur: 1 or 2 imp back to vikersund|pg||
nt|djneill: North, having passed, has 4 card support, a working @hQ, and a side doubleton - yeah I think 5@d is an underbid :-)|pg||
nt|rodal f: The CC for EW: http://www.nmlag.com/var/fckeditor/nmlag/file/2010/Harstad/Systemkort%20Harr-Bremseth.pdf|pg||
pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: The defence do not know opener's hand type immediately. |pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems so now. When 3@H came|pg||
nt|andyv:  looking for 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 2 nt 3 cl 3h should be alerted|pg||
nt|h_karluk: So does that make defending against the multi 2? easier or more difficult than against a weak two? In my opinion there's no problem  as long as you are sensible about it. ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Basically, assume that the 2D opener has a weak 2H/S hand. |pg||
nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx Torstein:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: :-)|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would expect most to double.  Meanwhile, this seems somewhat meek.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|h_karluk: There are numerous variations of the multi 2D, so let's assume a fairly basic one (weak major; strong minor or strong balanced). The suggested defence does not really change if ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there are other possibilities such as 4441 distributions  assume a weak opener. |pg||
nt|andyv:  like all systems...after a while a decent defense or multiple defenses are found and then we wait for the newest development.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: this is my laste Geir will now join |pg||
nt|lestergold: well both n/s stretching their values here |pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: bye all see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|rv: if Ringseth's had a stiff major, he could have jumped to 3M to show stiff and long @DS|pg||
nt|rv: unfortunately 3@c on 1@d-1n shows both minors and 18+hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: I hate  2 @c on unbalanced,  (tough to describe) hard to catch up |pg||
nt|rodal f: Was hard for W to lead a smal @H. Impossible I will say.|pg||

nt|rv: in any case it is best to play some science, either transfers or artificial 2n response as suggested by Anders|pg||
pc|c2|nt|h_karluk: you can freely bid|pg||

pc|c6|nt|rodal f: Well done Torstein and welcome to Geir as the new vug operator. See u tomorrow.|pg||
nt|lestergold: both final bids were overbids in my book|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was it?|pg||

pc|h2|nt|sharkey: The venue of this championship is Ålesund - a scenic town of about 60,000 inhabitants on the west coast of Norway.  |pg||

nt|andersk: red card:)|pg||
nt|andersk: @H 4|pg||
nt|djneill: well 1@h certainly worked out here, but had East passed it would not have - the idea is that a void ensures you will not play it at the 1-level|pg||
nt|jaheim: Forfot prob. consentrating in 9 tricks, too many boards left to bother about overtricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: a lot depends on how bad N can be for for 2S and--especially--whether NS have multiple ways to raise to 2S. if they do and N has already shown dreck, then he could be turned on by ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the 3H bid...although with 11 losers and bad trumps it is still hard to bid 4S. if they dont have 2 ways to raise to 2S, N can hardly bid a game even though he has heart values|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@S by 10HP and 10X by often 6@Ss in S seems OK at me.|pg||
nt|rv: in case Flatt is just dropping off:)|pg||
nt|andersk: yep:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: [erhaps the 3@s invite was the more optimistic of the two bids|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|rodal f: As a spec told me. And right he is. 4@H always on.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|larsarthur: reasonable play for an endplay|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3NT by 14HP after the invit from N ain't eigher bad, but a bit harder.|pg||
nt|anton72: 1 spade they lost |pg||
pc|hA|pc|d3|nt|anton72: :)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mcarroll: I play after 2@C, pd must bid a waiting 2D now 2@H< @S 3@C@D shows 8 playing tricks|pg||
nt|djneill: one way for E-W to look at this is that they balanced N-S into a game(slam) - but another better way to look at it is that this is completely normal, next hand, forget this one|pg||

nt|vugraphzbv: is there a way to win this? endplay of some sorts to W, maybe?|pg||
nt|andyv:  slam less than 50%... after such a great result on board 22, not sure why N decided to push so hard on this hand.|pg||
nt|pelu: endplay for down 1|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps he thought he was on a roll - and didnt think of protecting his good result|pg||

nt|rnmalik: big hand in S and all key cards with W. |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Slam time but also a sac by 800 for EW in @S.|pg||

pc|dT|nt|jcwla: That's not happening -- at least not as a result of forcing NT.|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  undertrick time|pg||

nt|rodal f: OK to show the 2 black colors by neg X, but might better to show 5 @S direct by 1@S|pg||

nt|djneill: either way, East should present a @h Jack or Ten, to induce a cover, even if really finessing the other way|pg||
nt|djneill: for instance, if East was on the board now, East could play the @hJ - planning on overtaking and hooking the other way|pg||
nt|djneill: North has no idea that East has the @hT so might just cover|pg||
nt|djneill: that extra chance takes you from 50% to maybe 70%, but here there are other clues to where the long @h are|pg||
nt|djneill: South doubled 1@h for takeout, so presumably has 8 @s and @d cards|pg||
nt|djneill: along with 2@c|pg||
nt|djneill: then South pitched a @h|pg||

nt|vugraphzkn: Back to 15 now and last now.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|hawe45:  What was Souths Double?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 1C I thought was strong club?|pg||
nt|jaheim: mm,  i dont think that NS are looking forward to the half time comparasing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah I am told 1@C is a transfer to @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Something wrong with the cards. They know the hands. Getting TD to check now. Going to 16 first.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  My advice: Tell teammates, that "we were sitting wrong as E/W"...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodal f: A spec came wit 3@S from S as a good raise then 4 might would have becomed a small slam try?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rodal f: THX also to the co comentators for all there nice and vice inputs for the specs and co comentators:) See u later.|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: thx all |pg||
nt|sybarra: and the X is?  "cards"  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3 in a row 4@s|pg||
nt|jcwla: Evjen failed in 3NT on 13 in the OR - so the rout is on.|pg||
nt|sybarra: well that overcall keeps n/s out of their ht "fit" |pg||
nt|jbgood: woodgrovers bid them up in the open room, but .... |pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharkey: On Bd 14 S Dbl OR but failed to bid 4@S over 4@Hso looks like a push|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be Shirley|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 5T contrat desire|pg||
nt|james_h: but 6d maked|pg||
nt|james_h: makes|pg||
nt|rv: interesting defensive problem here|pg||
nt|djneill: lol|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Surely does|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: They are playing with screens so the thinking don't matter that much as at open tables.|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: well, kind of :-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Hartvigsen's 3@C VUL not for the faint hearted....|pg||
nt|jcwla: A light passed-hand double by W - usually a good idea.|pg||
nt|djneill: N-S are playing in @h anyways, for 50 a pop|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: He said sorry and that he was frustrated by the slam play.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rodal f: Who know Shirley?:)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rodal f: I understand Remvik's 4@C. Hartvigsen should have been a bit stronger for his 3@C bid.|pg||
nt|hagz: 5 @c makes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with only one ace, i think 3N is very dubious. 3H better then if S bids 3N fine|pg||
pc|s6|nt|djneill: we can see North has opened 1@d instead of 1@h, with the same 4432 shape|pg||
nt|jbgood: no comment|pg||
nt|jbgood: i guess 2 @c is either dimonds or both majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Long talk between south and west, and now between vest and east|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|rodal f: Neg use to be normal.|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty all...wonderful show put on by all... and ty specs for your comments and help|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S snatches defeat from the jaws of victory - again|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But E gets in on the act|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2 times @H and @C give a pitch in @D at E and slam are on.|pg||
nt|jbgood: so 2 @s - and nobody agreed on 2@s |pg||
pc|cK|nt|mcarroll: and S again - again|pg||
nt|rv: North should duck first and second @hs to set this contract|pg||
nt|jaheim: when i played bridge on a high level, I always took a break and a smoke after a stupid mistake,  it helped me,  but still many smokingbreakes|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sharkey: One of those hand that plays well if pd just have trumps...|pg||
nt|sharkey: @D lead wud have ensured defeat|pg||
pc|c2|nt|djneill: so East can play this as if he is defending @h |pg||
nt|djneill: unfortunately, there is no @s finesse when N-S can see West's hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: which sh have been pass or correct|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@S at OR and @C lead on 30 so might some promblems there. But normaly 10 trick by cross ruffs.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rv: now he should hop with @sA and cash out|pg||
nt|rv: not easy at all|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jcwla: And Smith failed in 3NT on 14 -- so the lead plumps to 40.  Welcome to all who've joined us from the OR.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|djneill: 4@s was reached in the other room, and the 500 did score a few imps for E-W|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|larsarthur: flat board here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N could bid 3D too, but 3H sends more of a message that N is worried about spades|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|djneill: if I was N-S and I knew about the 5-0 @h break, I would do anything but bleed all the trumps|pg||
nt|djneill: so defenders here should do likewise|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C lead works as well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 9 hcp, no trump support, perhaps 3C wld be mistaken, so easy X in competition|pg||
pc|dT|nt|andyv:  good session for BK Grand which was able to stretch out it's lead|pg||
nt|james_h: right, the club situation not clear for N|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|james_h: up to that point|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mcarroll: a double would have led to a 71-0 score|pg||
nt|rv: these small contracts of playing and defending 1n just don't get adequate rewards in IMPs scoring|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|nt|rodal f: Trick one will cost many tricks now:(|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Probably makes no difference to the final result|pg||
nt|jaheim: mm   only 8 ims now, and 67- 0|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jaheim: imps|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rodal f: Tomorrow at 10.00CET the start will be Namsos agains Førde. Welcomed u all are:)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sharkey: off 2 I think|pg||
nt|jbgood: i am told that their card says multilandy, then it sh be both majors only|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hagz: 3 more imps to singsås|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rv: they are much tougher and aesthetically more pleasing especially for parntership angle than games and slams|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|jaheim: if 2 down|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ended -1 and a gain by the pass at 21HP:))) Unbelivable:)))|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: "Now you got the squees right" pd says with a smile. |pg||
nt|rnmalik: has he forgot about the 10@D now if not claim please.|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|vugraphzbv: 6nt S seems to be the best|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|andyv:  another 3N|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|andyv:  may find the slam now|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  nice bid by N|pg||
nt|jbgood: the slow road taken by S should imply some extra values|pg||
nt|andyv:  but why didn't S raise @ds the 2nd time?|pg||
mb|6N|nt|jbgood: because 3 NT might have been the end of it if N has a weaker hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  afraid to bypass 3N?  then he could have bid 3@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  they got there... well done|pg||

nt|h_karluk: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php |pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like there should be a slam someplace here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: kibitzers proudly welcomed|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But it was strong earlier in the round?|pg||
nt|rv: this is last deal of this round|pg||
nt|rv: thanks to excellent Vu graph operator Geir, my excellent co-commentators James and Anders|pg||
nt|james_h: Thx RV and Geo, pleasure to talk round the edges of your analysis :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Next session will start 14:45 local time|pg||
nt|mcarroll: a tough flat board|pg||
nt|jbgood: i guess the latter is in better position to know - he is on the team|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: I had the Students as one by two favorits, but the fieald is wide open this year.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are Petter having a problem to use the finger counting HP?:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder how they only made 5N in OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  seeing a lot of red:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not much surprise easy 11 tricks|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Anyway - new board|pg||
nt|sybarra: and last bd now |pg||
nt|djneill: yep, last brd of the set coming up|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  in 6 have to take the @s hook|pg||
nt|jcwla: As we reach the last board of this segment, a big thank you to our excellent operator, Geir Harnes.  Big thanks also to the NBF and BK Grand (Petter Haram, Terje Lie).  Big thanks ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: to Roland Wald, the tireless coordinator of BBO vugraph presentations.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  NOT making 1 NT seems rather difficult, losing 4 @h, 1 @C and 1@S|pg||
nt|jaheim:   1 NTstill 10 -13   |pg||
nt|djneill: thanks martin and shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Dan and Martin |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: huge hand in N|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sorry all. It start at 09.00CET.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What happened with Board 15?|pg||
nt|james_h: and Anders|pg||
nt|mcarroll: tx all|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sharkey: Will EW let opps play in 5@D Dbl?|pg||
nt|rodal f: At board 30 S passed by his 21 HP and didn't want to show the cards to his mate. YES. So many have asked so I took it publick:)))|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2IMP gain for the man with 21HP since 4@S vent -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  club leads probably preclude taking any hooks in 3N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @s hook works, no transportartion problems, flat board|pg||
nt|djneill: we could see another 5crd fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to our terrific operator, Gier |pg||
mb|3D|nt|h_karluk: and mighty @d ten :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  aren't there 12 tricks?|pg||
nt|andyv:  or am I missing something?|pg||
nt|andyv:  in NT|pg||
nt|jcwla: Finally, big thanks to my fellow commentators for their excellent insights: Lars Arthur Johansen and Marshall Lewis, and of course thanks to all specs.|pg||
nt|djneill: North should pass - short @h implies E-W are missing a @h fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: @dA+ruff?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: XX = 3S|pg||
nt|sybarra: and of course thx to our specs, with all the commdents we appreciate them |pg||
mb|3H|nt|sharkey: East's Pass is forcing - what's West to do?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 6@S makes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: tough to get to S hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: for the spade hook |pg||
nt|andyv:  true|pg||
nt|djneill: thanks Geir|pg||
nt|rodal f: The % for slam EW here is abough 45-47 I belive but hard to bid.|pg||

nt|vugraphzkn: :)|pg||
nt|james_h: nice invention there|pg||
nt|rv: Forde needs to reduce margin by atleast 7 IMPs to get 1 VP:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: The Norwegian Broadcasting Corp has mad a piece on this event: http://nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/more_og_romsdal/1.7124388|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: :)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|larsarthur: 44 or 45 imps difference is 22-8 in VPs |pg||
nt|sharkey: *made - not mad :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: @sK97x -- 9 still problem|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@D is force since Lie didn't get the chance for 3@C=second negative|pg||
mb|4N|nt|rv: also special thanks to Roland and BBO team for broadcasting such good tournies from all round the world and finally to all spectators for listening to us patiently|pg||
nt|djneill: ok the @h's are out of the bag|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: and dont think any would buy that Moysian fit|pg||
nt|djneill: great leat to start|pg||
nt|djneill: lead*|pg||
nt|sybarra: specs will note,  BBO does not give us free typing lessons or provide spell checker|pg||
nt|jbgood: in the open room W continued with the @h ace too...|pg||
mb|5S|nt|rodal f: Thx also to the exselent vug operator Torstein Hesseberg wich his nick name, Bavianen, from his papa |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes|pg||
nt|mcarroll: this is going from bad to worse for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: I have no idea, Hans, was discussing english spelling with my secretary  :)|pg||
nt|james_h: they can on board 30 if they blast into hyperspace (6@d)|pg||
nt|rodal f: One more half match tody. It will start in 44 min. Rama will be Topbridge against Vikersund.|pg||
mb|6D|nt|andyv:  :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: right,  just cash |pg||
nt|rodal f: Thanks also to the fellow comentators wich have made it a bit more easy for all of us. Specs as commentators as vug operators:) Well done.|pg||
nt|djneill: it may come down to the @c guess|pg||
nt|djneill: but there are endplay possibilities in @s too - @s and another means South will win and possibly give a ruff-sluff|pg||
nt|djneill: as North did not lead the @sK, there is small hint that South has doubleton honor|pg||
nt|djneill: @sQ here may solve it|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodal f: Got that because of his wild biddings when ma - pa - Tora(sister) and Torstein played privat.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|jaheim: think iI have to use the s-word again|pg||

nt|james_h: this has been an excecise in excruciation for Forde - all efforts backfired|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: No hook for shure. Its team and not match:)|pg||
nt|djneill: if North has the @cA, then the @s trick will not work (North will get in with the @c and cash the @s)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: For new specs. The web page: http://www.nmlag.com/|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzkn: thanks all see you in 20 min|pg||
