nt|sharkey: Norway....|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rodal f: Or a auto stop at 2@H?|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h should make |pg||
nt|rodal f: Looks as Ekrens 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: it is |pg||
nt|jaheim: but 9 tricks max|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - 8 to be exact - both ways|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: A rarity - a weak 2@D opener|pg||
nt|sharkey: the previous board was down 2 - not 1 - will be corrected|pg||

nt|andyv:  down at least 500|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx Torstein:)|pg||

nt|djneill: how many @s now, shirley?|pg||
nt|djneill: 2@s, 3@s seem the options|pg||
nt|stoffers: vulnerable thats a big 2@s i think...but when finding partner with a 6 card fit...no problem|pg||
nt|jaheim: chicken|pg||

nt|rodal f: 3@D=pick a major I belive.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rodal f: This contract is playable by a dobble hook in @C|pg||

nt|maribelxx: So we are at Ålesund now...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: looks reasonable - unless the 4-1 @H break becomes a problem|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here is a good example of a hand that natural bidders should open 1@D.|pg||
nt|larsarthur: south is not sure about @dfit|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Marshall Lewis|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hi all :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Must be prepared for all continuations -- here, 1@D and then 3@C and you feel much better than this.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@c seems a better contract ironically|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Vul cannot take a chance.|pg||
nt|jaheim: 1@s shows 4@s and 4+@h|pg||
nt|stoffers: whaaat? Have they been in Stjørdal? :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Some Norwegians in other places may disagree....|pg||
mb|3H|nt|andyv:  now it's serious:)|pg||
nt|larsarthur: lowest 4-card is std in Norway|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Marshalll.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A spec asked why Harstad havn't been at BBO. They try to do there best and match 7 are not putted up. They told.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now 5@H+4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|hagz: Hard to guess @s in 3 NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Just one thing left to do! Bid the 6er....|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually isnt 3n a trick short on a heart lead?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sharkey: A @D lead appears to be best for defence|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S had only 4 losers imo|pg||
nt|jcwla: Interesting to know but that doesn't begin and end the conversation for me in terms of how best to describe this hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Anders Kristensen and GeO Tislevoll (partly)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Running scores at  http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1074140R|pg||
nt|djneill: thanks Geir Harnes, who says East is a cousin of Geir Helgemo|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wander what's gona happen in OR at this? |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: there are arguments on both sides, but you aren;lt getting full value for money out of sputnik if you follow the same sequence with this S hand and also on   xx  AKx   xx  Axxxxx|pg||
nt|james_h: tricky rebid in normal systems for south, no such difficulty here 1@s must be 5?|pg||
nt|rv: 1@s possibly shows 5@s here|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi folks!|pg||
nt|geot: Hi friends:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 1 spade was not forcing|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Andres, wlc|pg||
nt|james_h: Hi Geo|pg||
nt|djneill: 3@s shows an unbalanced hand typically, but occasionally 4522 - East has a sharp hand, so at IMPs the idea is to just bid game and hope to make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice name to have going into competition |pg||
nt|djneill: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  on @s lead, can N still hold it down to only 4 losers?|pg||
nt|andyv:  without dbl dummying the @c suit?|pg||
nt|james_h: Hi Anders|pg||
nt|maribelxx: Partner doubled top show spades|pg||
nt|maribelxx: Better to keep him happy and lead his suit :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome back Frank|pg||
nt|rodal f: But taken as ask for hold in @D til 4@D came|pg||
nt|sharkey: like Christer..|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rodal f: If any want to look at the pairs systemcards u find them here: http://www.nmlag.com/Systemkort til the turney is fin|pg||
nt|jcwla: When the clubs are significantly stronger or you will be able to handle all continuations, I have no problem with 1@C.  Here, a rebid problem such as this was reasonably likely.|pg||
nt|hagz: yeah, there is only one entrance the the dummy to get the @s tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This might have - regarding the bidding - about 7Â½ % chance to make|pg||
nt|rnmalik: but for 8@H this hand has all the possibilities of making 6:)|pg||
nt|maribelxx: As for declarer where would the 7th trick come from?|pg||
nt|rodal f: So WD.|pg||
nt|stoffers: Lyngseidet takes your breath away...not exactly a town but still..|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: i suppose 2d sgowing i assume 4 spades might pick them|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant be done really |pg||
nt|hagz: Can't get them|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to make a decision as to how to tackle the diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: can play i suppose to ruff 2 hearts in dummy|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you ask then too much|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in other words, i think the disadvantages of 1C outweight the advantages|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I believe Frank is at the venue in Ålesund|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andersk: If you all look at the butler scoores, then you understand why Im here and not playing:)|pg||
nt|djneill: I have a big cousin in name only - Bruce Neill of Australia|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|sharkey: makes with the hool|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|sharkey: W wud be better off returning @DQ and E had to duck.  Think that would have ensured 1 down on overruff|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive this will end -3 and 150 while NS have 10 in @S. So 1 or 10 IMP gain for Singsås it seems.|pg||
nt|stoffers: theres a lot of nice places in norway, and if you ask ten norwegians on the street i bet you that not even 1/3 of them will answer Alesund to be the nicest..|pg||
nt|stoffers: if your not standing in Ålesund asking that is ofcource|pg||

nt|rodal f: 4-1 easy to handle in @S but not at @H|pg||
pc|hA|nt|geot: Hi guys. Lets hope Førde can fight back a bit in this secon half of the match. What they were able to show in the first half was unfortunately not their usual level at all |pg||

nt|geot: sure. We have all been there:)|pg||
nt|andersk: lets see if Hjelmeland can male this|pg||
nt|andersk: make|pg||
nt|rv: declarer needs to take @s finesse, if he plays @s from top, 4-1 break might scuttle the contract|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sharkey: Not many use weak 2@D opener - I believe it sometimes is very effective|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway -500 not too bad for NS:)|pg||
nt|djneill: there is a general rule that against 3-suiters, you want to lead trumps - it is just a rule that works - and West has a semi-3suited hand, so South's trump switch was reasonable|pg||
nt|maribelxx: 4 @H might have been an interesting contract btw|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|andyv:  true|pg||
nt|andyv:  vs. 550:)|pg||

nt|rodal f: Will they try a new hard one NS?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nope.|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie e/w has more play for 4@s than n/s has for 4@h in spite of the hcp distribution in n/s favour|pg||
nt|lestergold: north passing i assume a strong nt holding a 9 count??|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it happens its a winning decision|pg||
nt|rodal f: The NT use to be 15-17 but can be 14 at there CC.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well must be something like that but there is serious risk of missing a game|pg||

nt|stoffers: could have been, if Bremseth didnt make that slight overbid..|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jaapfr: trow in N and in double renonce extra trick so 5 was sure|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @C @S @D @D and 11 tr|pg||
nt|andyv:  right...11 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  you dbl with S hand 2N here?|pg||
nt|rodal f: But NS pressed 2@HS and 4@HN|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Still in US Carl?|pg||
nt|sharkey: since 3@D makes gain 1 imp|pg||
nt|rv: my personal belief is if you are down by any margin (large or small), it is best to play as accurately as possible and hope for luck and opps to make mistakes, playing against odds ...|pg||
nt|rv: is not correct strategy ever:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: a scary bidding board|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Anton and welcome:) SW at same side of the screen|pg||
nt|anton72: looks like boring 110 ...no poss for extra tricks for defence or declarer|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@H normaly a good lift in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: -200 or even -300 to punish W for his 2nt bd|pg||
nt|andyv:  I like when I raise my partner's suit and he/she finds another suit to lead.|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all sorry I am late |pg||
nt|andyv:  never to late, Shirley:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi Shirley|pg||
nt|rodal f: No minisplinter on for NS it seems, but then S would have signed off anyway.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 tricks with this lead.|pg||
nt|jaheim: it looks like 9 tricks|pg||
nt|maribelxx: VIkersund second 90 and Singsås third 74|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: no - sunny Stavanger :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect if D were Kxx and clubs KQxx, he would have been more likely to open|pg||
nt|djneill: ok @h lead which gives up the suit, but if South ducks, there goes the entry to the @c, so South should rise with the @hA|pg||
nt|djneill: @c behave, so 10 tops - 6@c, 2@h, 1@s, 1@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: can not get greedy on this hand |pg||
nt|rodal f: Will the be taken by X and 300 or will 5@S come?|pg||
nt|rodal f: the safe*|pg||
nt|rodal f: 5@D can even become 500|pg||
pc|hA|nt|larsarthur: probably|pg||
nt|anton72: Hi ... thx ...just was wondered who was explained 2 NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Brb 3-4 min|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  too:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i dislike 2nt bid W|pg||
nt|andyv:  because of 3rd seat opener, S was not tempted to dbl opps into game|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree with u Mike. A invit would have been normal.|pg||
nt|maribelxx: I assume 2@D was a Michaels' type bid... interesting use of the tool|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. Only 300 if Xed|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|rodal f: OK. So nice weather there two:) Welcome back home.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not sure I like Flått's neg x Vul - 4 HCP in Q & Js|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  I don't mind it... W is a passed hand and can expect a bit better @c suit than pd put down|pg||
nt|jcwla: Pass seems normal on the actual hand, though reasonable intermediates and medium spots make it look not totally watered-down.|pg||
nt|andersk: still 4 matches to go, and a long way to go, so medal is still possible if we improve!|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I second that; I have been in that position too often for comfort|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: once again it may be systemic, but i am not keen on the sequence chosen by E here. Even facing a PH, this E hand has significant game potential in a suit, so i would want to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maximize our opportunities to show suits|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 20 HCP and 4 card support for pard, e will be disappointed there is no Grand slam|pg||
nt|james_h: I do sometimes do in the last segment of the Bermuda Bowl when 16+ behind|pg||
nt|rv: @C lead and @d switch required to beat this which is double dummy defebse|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzkn: V, but there also seems to be a wrong explenation so we will see.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|sharkey: been here a while now - only leave during cold season...|pg||
nt|jaheim: Flått is prob thinking about the Q of @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: They picked up the cards wrong so Flått opened in 1 heart. All bids alerted after 1 heart.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s what I doÂ´nt like with 2 NT - how many @H has West - you never know|pg||
nt|rv: normal @d lead should result in 10 tricks|pg||
nt|andersk: When all 5 players have been under pari, it is not easy. The easy part is that we cant blame any but ouhrselves:)|pg||
nt|djneill: yes, only way for more than 10 is if opponents pitch hearts and spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or Christer?|pg||
nt|jaheim: but always afraid of @c 5-3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rv: Anders, are the top Norwegian pairs like Helgemo-Helness, Grotheim-Tundal, Brogeland-pd playing this event?|pg||
nt|andersk: No|pg||
nt|andersk: They are not qualyfied (Im not sure if they played from start)|pg||
nt|james_h: and Geo has gone south for the Spring|pg||
nt|geot: :)|pg||
nt|andersk: This event is played like 6 rounds of knockout matches, then 8 teams meet for a final long weekend|pg||
nt|james_h: and NZ dollars :)|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|rv: ok, still presume quality of bridge on display is quite high|pg||

nt|rnmalik: true|pg||

pc|h7|nt|andyv:  question really is if E should leave the 2N bid in|pg||

nt|mcarroll: 6NT to guard the @S tenace|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jcwla: Eh la la.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jaheim: big question @s 3-3? or @c 5-3|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jaapfr: but 3@C will get a X by S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: although i still like 3@C by E|pg||
nt|lestergold: can make 3N on this line|pg||
nt|jaheim: soon  next board  zzzzzzzz|pg||
nt|rodal f: K@S as lavental became wrong now:). @C is better.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|djneill: South is pressurizing E-W with the long suit - sometimes odd things happen|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: has to play safe tho to ensure 1N|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  I like 3@c just to keep my partners happy|pg||
nt|jaheim: winning line|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|maribelxx: I like south's 3NT bid|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jaapfr: :)|pg||
nt|james_h: my experience is that there is great strength in depth in Norge|pg||
pc|h9|nt|anton72: not so clear line to bid 4 @s ...so I think can be 2 VP from result after match|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 NT overcall after 1@C often tend to be minor suit oriented; otherwise x for t/o |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s6|nt|jcwla: I agree with you, Marshall -- I don't think some of these 1@C openings give enough thought to the rebid.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzkn: we have to reset the tables brb|pg||
nt|larsarthur: ok|pg||
nt|jcwla: The @D plays just way too helpful here.|pg||

nt|andersk: top 8 club teams, this year:)|pg||
nt|stoffers: was out getting food, question was?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: partial here may be 3@C for NS.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: I think e/w will try 4 @S here at the end of the day |pg||
nt|jaapfr: still   Studentenes sounds very female to me but do not master Norwegian|pg||
nt|andyv:  S took a far more aggressive stance on board 1 and found the excellent save of 5@d for 9 imp gain|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR|pg||
nt|rv: so quality of bridge on display should definitely be of high standard|pg||
nt|djneill: that @h suit was an example of keeping the final contract in sight, and not mechanically play the suit by itself |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: On Board 1 Studentenes have picked up 11 IMPs - not 10.  6@S at this table was off 2.  This will be corrected|pg||
nt|rodal f: By his 9HP Forfot ain't fare away for a normalopening.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharkey: Shud be some action here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3@C some kind of mixed raise?|pg||

nt|lestergold: ah that explains |pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: funny faces in here :-)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sharkey: So far NS have not been able to introduce their @D suit - may be too late now|pg||
nt|sybarra: or will E venture 3 nt at some point |pg||
nt|andyv:  actually N deserves the credit for dbling 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|rodal f: At board 2 OR are on there way for 6@S. 4@H splinter at W so fare|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: West opens a feather light vulnerable 1@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Rekstad originally played for another Topbridge team but lost to Vikersund in the 3d knockout match. He is hungry for revenge.|pg||
nt|stoffers:  i use it, some dont. I'm quitting it soon, going over to invitational bids directly instead 1@s-3@h invitational and @h :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B18 had same bid as here til 3NT. OR bidded 4@H insteed of 4@D for major.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: we also have another team event plaing like a premier leuage, two 2. divisjons 8 3. divisjons etc, premier leuage is the top team event, this is the top club team event|pg||
nt|rv: do EW play standard or a limited system?|pg||
nt|james_h: Any kibs have outline system info?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 5-5-4-2 with transfers after 1cl openings|pg||
nt|djneill: unsupported Queen and Jack are dubious|pg||
nt|anton72: trum lead beat it|pg||
nt|jaheim: how can u stop Bremset with 14 points?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: south cannot make anything at the 3 level|pg||
nt|sybarra: but its a good hand! |pg||
nt|rodal f: 6@S came at board 2 OR. So a swing it magistern.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can end up in 3NT also but that would be a bad contract on @H lead.|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@H at E|pg||
nt|rodal f: And W at the tank now.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sharkey: Kib informs 3@C asks for strength and suit quality|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6!@S probably down 1 although 5@S likely to be +1|pg||

nt|rodal f: U have the funniest any way Torstein:) I will come to Ålesund tomorrow non. Will be nice to see u again.|pg||
nt|djneill: you like the long @d suit shirley?  looks nice|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6/4 with spades |pg||
nt|mcarroll: not quite a Roland 19-21 and it looks like the 19 count wins|pg||
nt|djneill: welcome martin|pg||
nt|jaheim: 4@s best contract but............ will go down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes-they have 9 tricks at @S contract.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: NS precision club|pg||
nt|andersk: normally there are 5-8 very good teams in this team final, some years the level is not abselout top|pg||
nt|geot: The nightmare for Førde seems to continue. The 4@S North went down in here (board 18) was played in 4@H at the other table, won by Cantona Nybo. 13 impsmore|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Dan, Shirley|pg||
nt|djneill: ok so another entry-related hand|pg||
pc|c2|nt|stoffers: no 3@c in passoutseat?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sharkey: so wise of NS to stay out of the bidding as appears 5@D x wud be off 800|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jaapfr: good leading technique|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|rv: par contract is 5@d for EW though 4@s makes as well|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like PA is trying to play 4@S |pg||
nt|rodal f: So Davidsen didn't like Nybo's pass for a might pan and bidded 2@D.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|geot: In 5@D you have to guess the trumps|pg||
nt|james_h: another reason to take the normal line|pg||
nt|djneill: pretty much no way to get to the @d so East must duck a @d, even if South covers|pg||
nt|stoffers: -1 now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would u have done at vul?|pg||
nt|stoffers: indeed..knowing opps have a 9 card fit, they will probabyly fight once more|pg||
nt|stoffers: and vul its 670, nv only 470|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive Allars will thing a bit more at safetyplay after the @HA. Hum|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Allard picks up a card in every suit in his hand. Not sure which route to take.|pg||
nt|rodal f: What would X from N be after 3@C. But hard to come with it if for pan..|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi all. Sr for the con problems:( Running scores: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1074140R|pg||
pc|c9|nt|andyv:  W's 5@s bid asked for what?|pg||
nt|andyv:  club control or trump?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @S support i say|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi:) Normaly trumh cuality.|pg||
nt|andyv:  if so, then 6@s was optomistic by E|pg||
nt|rodal f: quality*|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even wrong bid E|pg||
nt|rv: how many brds per round, we seem to have started off with a huge score in favor or Namsos BK?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: as he does|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcwla: Will we get a failing @H finesse?|pg||
nt|geot: 16 boards|pg||
nt|andersk: 16 a round  32 a match|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently systemic to open 1H on the W hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: And he was right. 2@CX=8 But 3@D seems as -1 and 200|pg||
nt|rodal f: B18 ended 4@H, normaly down while 4@S was a easy play.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|larsarthur: how can it fail?|pg||
nt|maribelxx: In NT @H8 provides a stopper|pg||
nt|rodal f: CC for EW: http://www.nmlag.com/var/fckeditor/nmlag/file/2010/Studentenes/skjetne-forfot.pdf|pg||
nt|rodal f: At OR.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sharkey: i predict 10 tricks - probably wrong again....|pg||
nt|rodal f: At NS i must look it up. Brb.|pg||
nt|maribelxx: these length stoppers are often overlooked... |pg||
nt|stoffers: throw the K man..|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jaapfr: better claim down 1 to make dummy not too ashamed:)|pg||
nt|rv: East will pass and West will bid 5@d to deny first round control|pg||
nt|maribelxx: but here of course, only 8 tricks anyway when losing two spades too|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Ringseth claimed 9 at this point. They surely do not waste any time.|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - card you're known to have|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|geot: So easy for us, seeing all cards.....to play the trumps without a loser. Not that easy at the table|pg||
nt|james_h: indeed|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|rv: if cue bid is doubled by opps, redouble shows first round control, bidding another suit shows cue in that suit and promises second round control of suit|pg||
nt|djneill: so South must think - is there a possible layout that gives us 3 more tricks outside of @d immediately|pg||

nt|rnmalik: friendly cards for 4@H for NS.|pg||
nt|maribelxx: It would have been tempting to bid game - good stop by south|pg||

nt|stoffers: 3 or 4@d?|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Stop the E/W wagon, I want to get off|pg||
nt|rv: once partner doesn't super-accept your transfer, you would tend to pass with 8 hcp and invite only with 9 on 5332 or 5422 shape|pg||
nt|james_h: 4s easier in practice|pg||
nt|andersk: Førde again trying to get back by bidding too much|pg||
nt|stoffers: that 2@h bid deserves a huuuuge penalty..|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@D now show some cards. If not lebensol 2NT as order for E to bid 3@C and 31D tell minimum hand at W|pg||

pc|cT|nt|jaheim: my guess i mean|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jcwla: Can still do it.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Back in a flash.|pg||
nt|stoffers: its different to show cards and have 100 honours in an unbid suit frank, i bid 4@d|pg||
nt|rodal f: A @H lead will come from N. But at 6@D it need to be the K for @C swich|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Eliassen finally alerts the bid and then alerts his head after:)|pg||
nt|stoffers: how can N lead a@h? :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|djneill: lol, I try not to say anything when I put my dummy down - it tends to distract partner :-)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  and would still end up in 2@s:)|pg||
nt|larsarthur: well done!|pg||
nt|andersk: abselout supermax in North, still no chanse to make a game, can it be right?|pg||
nt|anton72: too many things are well placed .... they have only 23 hcp|pg||
nt|maribelxx: This should be quite straight forward play, at least I don't see any big problems|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rodal f: Style and deal I belive, but after the bids from W it seems correct. Or?|pg||
nt|stoffers: best line here is to play a @d maybe?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rv: this is not the way to get back, you only slide further more often that:)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|larsarthur: :(|pg||
nt|james_h: I tend to go with all 9 hcp except flat with no 10's and 9's|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rodal f: You as many others would have done I belive. It's only a @C lead that keep them of 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|djneill: knowing the split - any singleton with East leaves 4 @d losers, North is not unhappy to let West ruff|pg||
nt|djneill: when West passes a 2-level takeout, it shows a stack|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ure right. Normal for many to take the @HK, but not for all.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  I see more of an advantage for DONT in direct seat... in pass out seat, something simpler might be better|pg||
nt|stoffers: how Rekstad can find his 4@h and 5@c bid i really dont understand|pg||
pc|h3|nt|stoffers: partner has bid 3@d..he didnt act over 2@h,...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Eliassen shakes his head and mumbles to himself.|pg||
nt|stoffers: he cant be that good, and i would say he's got a strong maximum for his bidding so far|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - @D9 drops next time|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|sharkey: and @C2 was "encouraging" from S so N continues...|pg||
nt|stoffers: averything is very friendly|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: I often play a system in direct seat and natural in pass out seat (or landy only) |pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|james_h: North is going through more mental anguish|pg||

nt|maribelxx: Declarer has to take of the timing though, to be able to execute plays in minors|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|sharkey: Even with @C lead I believe slam makes as @D set up|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South was end-played in the lead - only one of three could beat 3 NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: and passing one levels can be even worse |pg||
nt|rodal f: The web side for the turney. U willfind all info u need there: http://www.nmlag.com/|pg||
nt|stoffers: @d now best. On the J@s N better duck it, take the next and play @c. Then Jørn have to play a small @h to endplay S.|pg||
nt|sharkey: this makes in comfort|pg||
nt|stoffers: it does?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mcarroll: On @C K lead declarer needs to hold up twice|pg||

nt|vugraphzkn: Cannot! He takes it directly in his arm. Would be messy..|pg||
nt|stoffers: he have to follow my line i think..|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: better ruff |pg||

nt|lestergold: north's 2 points are working very haARD INDEED|pg||
nt|djneill: ok in other room brd 2, same contract and defense, but East embarked on a total crossruff that was unlucky when North was short in @c - one trick short|pg||

nt|lestergold: yje stiff hert is an obvious value to N but how can he know how imprtant the Q@c is?|pg||
nt|djneill: ok a 3crd @h raise - it is fine but takes a little judgement or gadgetry to then show that - I think requiring 4 cards is a reasonable agreement|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: S is being pragmatic opening the 5 card @S suit - this in order he'll be able to show both suits|pg||
nt|stoffers: 3nt was very nice, but diamonds dont behave, but in 4@h they do after this lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still Allard got it as he wanted, but don't know yet:)|pg||

pc|h2|nt|sharkey: I believe North's 2@C can be a several types of hands - if Kib knows pls inform|pg||
nt|sharkey: No - Frank - not on this one :)|pg||

pc|hA|nt|mcarroll: With no real source of tricks will lose 4 @C, and with the red suits not breaking may lose 4 more for - 200|pg||
nt|andersk: @C A @S ruff and over ruff|pg||
nt|jaheim: King of @c showing @d|pg||

nt|maribelxx: Maybe a claim again?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: They claimed before the lead:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: The odd for 5-1    1-5 is 14.5% the @S color. Will any table end at 7@S?|pg||
nt|maribelxx: LOL|pg||
pc|h3|nt|anton72: lead @s only beat it|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ure right Anton:)|pg||
nt|anton72: he already make it|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|lestergold: partner has promised more than 4 spades |pg||
nt|rv: playing 2/1 style, most play 3@d as Invite and GF via 4th suit (2@h)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N usually an invite since you have 2@c and 3@c to show a variety of @s raises|pg||
nt|djneill: after 2 trumps, West knows there is no pt to playing a third and will get the @s ruff|pg||
nt|rodal f: As 3NT OR might also do. So a push?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hawe45:  BUT: @D - and @S to the 10 (50-50) = SEVEN tricks|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andersk: easy make now|pg||
nt|sharkey: Good result for Harstad as EW easily makes 1 NT|pg||
nt|stoffers: no time if they play @c's|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rv: Ringseth's 3@d showed Invitational strength with 4+@ds|pg||

nt|rodal f: Wonder why not Andy. U have 2@C as the other posibillity for foring. What else could 2NT be? |pg||
nt|rodal f: Agreements:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  how about a balanced 12-13 hcp hand?|pg||
nt|andyv:  partner did overcall and you want to invite|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|djneill: ok now West will make 5 on a black squeeze if North cashes a @d now|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkey: As expected Grand picked up IMPs on Bd 3 where EW let 3@H make|pg||
nt|rodal f: But all up to how strong the 2@D bid can be. It often use to be wide in Norway.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i dont think there is any harm in sp[lintering ion the way f u are prepared to jumop to 4 level in any case|pg||
nt|djneill: South must guard @s and @c|pg||
nt|djneill: and it plays like a double squeeze since the @d9 is a threat against North|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the second @D will kill S |pg||
pc|s9|nt|anton72: A @c .... ruff @d with J 2 trumps ...ruff @c ... we are in home|pg||
nt|jaheim: and 2 down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1.|pg||
nt|stoffers: in dummy with the A@h there was also a case for playing diamond towards the K, seing the J@h from Ringseth|pg||
pc|d2|nt|djneill: it's good of West to do this on purpose, right, for our entertainment?  ruffing @s would be so basic (is there a serious way that would go down?)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Mee too - but we all know, that 4-2 is the most frequent|pg||

nt|rodal f: At OR they turned @S when they enterd in @C so 10 tricks and a IMP for the Students.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sorry. He played him self down for 10 here two.|pg||

nt|vugraphzkn: 2 nt was stenberg|pg||

nt|h_karluk: their column. They've many special treatments, absolutely not classic|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has a choice oer 1S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Best idea is to claim - |pg||
nt|rv: one of the reasons K/O matches are preferred in final stages of ACBL and World events is because of this strategy of teams not doing well playing anti-percentage bridge|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Multi|pg||
nt|marlowepi: american tendency is 2C then double|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sharkey: I believe Grand BK is one of the country's oldest bridge clubs with lots of traditions|pg||
nt|sybarra: so using multi|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If  @Hs are supported immediately I would bet on the slam being bid|pg||
nt|anton72: no sry|pg||

mb|1S|nt|h_karluk: p/c 2H|pg||

nt|rodal f: Sr. 1NT and 2@C. Was blind|pg||
nt|rodal f: Rashed my son. U are forgiven there:))))|pg||
mb|d!|nt|rodal f: 31HP NS and will stop at level 5 I presume.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam on a finesse|pg||
nt|rodal f: But will get 2 aces away by 4NT.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: useful for NS to play transfers in this situation|pg||
nt|sybarra: may hear screeching of brakes at both tables |pg||
nt|djneill: true, 3-4 support is more encouraging than 3crd after a checkback sequence|pg||
nt|djneill: North passed and South lost breath|pg||

mb|3S|nt|andyv:  agree, Hamdi... that's what makes this game so fascinating|pg||

nt|rodal f: But a interestin @C contract EW.|pg||
nt|rv: in Round Robin, teams not doing well can really upset the field by not playing seriously|pg||

nt|andersk: unbalanced GF|pg||
nt|james_h: 3?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|andyv:  W not elated with the dbl|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The defence to the Multi Two Diamonds is fundamentally different from the defence to a weak two for a number of reasons: |pg||
nt|andyv:  2N leb?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then can raise to 2S in two different ways, distinguishing pure obstruction from some genuine values|pg||
nt|djneill: some might open South's hand 2@c based on the large number of tricks, right?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes I think the S hand should use whatever forcing opening they use, I would open 2@C|pg||
nt|djneill: 2@c being a strong ART bid, for any poles|pg||
nt|anton72: nice spot ...120|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Simonsen needed a small break after the last one to reboot so we start again.|pg||
nt|maribelxx: Wise saving energy for difficult things|pg||
nt|stoffers: 3@s shows walues i guess?|pg||
nt|stoffers: its a 2@d for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: The direct defender always gets two opportunities to bid. |pg||
nt|jaheim: Strong cl NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A new gain for Vikersund|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  looks like it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The 4th seat defender usually gets two opportunities to bid.|pg||
nt|andersk: Maybe they dont play 2 NT as unbalanced GF|pg||
nt|rv: anyone for transfers on 1m-1n?|pg||
nt|james_h: I prefer 2n to 2@h|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very difficult to bid that and may only make on @S lead.|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree - too good for 3@S |pg||
pc|sA|nt|sharkey: Our excellent operator, Torstein Hesseberg, informs me the club is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year - also followed by a big tournement this fall|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not shure there|pg||
nt|larsarthur: 1 or 2 imp back to vikersund|pg||
nt|djneill: North, having passed, has 4 card support, a working @hQ, and a side doubleton - yeah I think 5@d is an underbid :-)|pg||
nt|rodal f: The CC for EW: http://www.nmlag.com/var/fckeditor/nmlag/file/2010/Harstad/Systemkort%20Harr-Bremseth.pdf|pg||
pc|s2|nt|h_karluk: The defence do not know opener's hand type immediately. |pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems so now. When 3@H came|pg||
nt|andyv:  looking for 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 2 nt 3 cl 3h should be alerted|pg||
nt|h_karluk: So does that make defending against the multi 2? easier or more difficult than against a weak two? In my opinion there's no problem  as long as you are sensible about it. ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Basically, assume that the 2D opener has a weak 2H/S hand. |pg||
nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx Torstein:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: :-)|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would expect most to double.  Meanwhile, this seems somewhat meek.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|h_karluk: There are numerous variations of the multi 2D, so let's assume a fairly basic one (weak major; strong minor or strong balanced). The suggested defence does not really change if ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there are other possibilities such as 4441 distributions  assume a weak opener. |pg||
nt|andyv:  like all systems...after a while a decent defense or multiple defenses are found and then we wait for the newest development.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: this is my laste Geir will now join |pg||
nt|lestergold: well both n/s stretching their values here |pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: bye all see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|rv: if Ringseth's had a stiff major, he could have jumped to 3M to show stiff and long @DS|pg||
nt|rv: unfortunately 3@c on 1@d-1n shows both minors and 18+hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: I hate  2 @c on unbalanced,  (tough to describe) hard to catch up |pg||
nt|rodal f: Was hard for W to lead a smal @H. Impossible I will say.|pg||
nt|maribelxx: A lot of tricks here too|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht lead looks likely and no play|pg||
nt|rodal f: CC for NS: http://www.nmlag.com/var/fckeditor/nmlag/file/2010/Studentenes/skjetne-forfot.pdf|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rodal f: Seems as OR misplayed this board. They lost two tricks in @S + 3@Hs|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well 110 was on EW and 200 to pay for NS now. Normaly.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: 4th seat  Assuming RHO bids a weak 2d |pg||
nt|andyv:  nice acution|pg||
nt|jaheim: and a coffeebreak|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: bye Torstien|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Now things are different, LHO and RHO are both weak|pg||
nt|sybarra: that 9 of @S in dummy is a big card |pg||
nt|james_h: another find the lady hand|pg||
nt|rv: in any case it is best to play some science, either transfers or artificial 2n response as suggested by Anders|pg||
nt|maribelxx: I wonder what was 3 @S|pg||
nt|stoffers: 130 for Ringseth if he dont find a miracle play to go down or somthing, i'm getting coffee|pg||
pc|d5|nt|h_karluk: you can freely bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: as is the club holding |pg||
nt|andyv:  but will be difficult to find Q@d unless following the Crane rule:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: WD by NS|pg||
nt|maribelxx: If showing the singleton then north has no problems|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: and crane rule is?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive 2NT should been alerted for trancfere to minor or @D. Correct Geir?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rodal f: Well done Torstein and welcome to Geir as the new vug operator. See u tomorrow.|pg||
nt|lestergold: both final bids were overbids in my book|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was it?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|andyv:  Q was under the J in the minor and over the J in the major|pg||
nt|andyv:  and don't ask me why that works... seemed to have worked for him:)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sharkey: The venue of this championship is Ålesund - a scenic town of about 60,000 inhabitants on the west coast of Norway.  |pg||
nt|jcwla: 5@D on a finesse failing in the other room and down 2.|pg||
nt|andersk: might get the @D right now|pg||
nt|anton72: and not loose @d?|pg||
nt|maribelxx: Got confirmation that 2NT already showed both minors|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sharkey: This year they have a GOOD football team as well....|pg||

pc|c2|nt|rv: South did well not to open his mouth:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: So they said the people watching OR here.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: S are pressed for a @S hook and 1@S 2@H loosers.|pg||
nt|rodal f: But Davidsen was taken after the neg X from Nybo|pg||
pc|s6|nt|maribelxx: And after that a cuebid in spades - very effective bidding at a low level|pg||
nt|rodal f: Spec told me both minorsThx Per-Ove:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 2nt showed 9 minor cards and 3 spade showed shortage|pg||
nt|maribelxx: hope they do not claim right away - becase i need some coffee :)|pg||

pc|dA|nt|andyv:  that will help declarer|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|rv: wd|pg||
nt|andersk: red card:)|pg||
nt|andersk: @H 4|pg||
nt|djneill: well 1@h certainly worked out here, but had East passed it would not have - the idea is that a void ensures you will not play it at the 1-level|pg||
nt|jaheim: Forfot prob. consentrating in 9 tricks, too many boards left to bother about overtricks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: a lot depends on how bad N can be for for 2S and--especially--whether NS have multiple ways to raise to 2S. if they do and N has already shown dreck, then he could be turned on by ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the 3H bid...although with 11 losers and bad trumps it is still hard to bid 4S. if they dont have 2 ways to raise to 2S, N can hardly bid a game even though he has heart values|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@S by 10HP and 10X by often 6@Ss in S seems OK at me.|pg||
nt|rv: in case Flatt is just dropping off:)|pg||
nt|andersk: yep:)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: [erhaps the 3@s invite was the more optimistic of the two bids|pg||
nt|anton72: in this case David Coperfied have to feel some shame :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: one @H ruff and @D, claim +2.|pg||
nt|stoffers: was down now with @d 3-1 the other way|pg||
nt|stoffers: and might miss now!|pg||

nt|vugraphzkn: small coffe and sig...breake|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 5 min...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: foto from the first half  www.nmlag.com/Bildegalleri/Kamp-1|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: back|pg||
nt|sybarra: Pix almost look like team orange of the Neth. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: with only 3 mediocre hearts, i prefer 2C over an iummediate double. the double can come next time|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would have floated 2@s with north and i wouldnt have been tioo excited about the quality of my spade suit as south|pg||
nt|lestergold: im hardly one of those|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|djneill: that would work - North would rebid something over 2@h like 2@s, and South would rebid 4@d maybe (or 3@d)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3NT S at OR.|pg||
nt|rodal f: I was a bit wrong at board 6. 7@S also on by two reed ruffs and a auto hook are up.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Nice "table presence" of Ringnes :)|pg||
nt|stoffers: 7 boards, 4 imps scored..Not what i expected sunday morning after the banquet..|pg||
nt|stoffers: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Sr. The CC are oposit. CC for NS is: http://www.nmlag.com/var/fckeditor/nmlag/file/2010/Harstad/Systemkort%20Harr-Bremseth.pdf|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mcarroll: Even worse, if opps bid to a @H or@D slam it takes a @C lead to beat it|pg||
nt|rnmalik: big hand in S and all key cards with W. |pg||
mb|1H|nt|rodal f: Slam time but also a sac by 800 for EW in @S.|pg||
nt|lestergold: politics in uk has become very promiscuous with all sorts of incompatible people jumping intop political beds with each other|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR ended 5@DX|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@H a good lift in @S I belive|pg||
nt|rodal f: brb sr tlf|pg||
nt|sharkey: may be because of the banquet - low energy level.....|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|sharkey: This is a hard slam to bid I think, Frank|pg||
nt|sharkey: After East's 1@D opening....|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree there, but on.|pg||
nt|djneill: lol yes balancing into a slam is a great way to endear yourself to partner|pg||
nt|sharkey: a heavy 2@D or 2@H the options|pg||
nt|sharkey: or perhaps a neg x with correction back to @D|pg||
nt|sharkey: N wishes he opened 1 NT...|pg||
mb|2H|an|alert|nt|rodal f: @C support and @S controll|pg||
nt|djneill: East invites here?|pg||
nt|maribelxx: Guessing that east can make distinction of 3 card raise and 4 card raise|pg||
mb|d|nt|james_h: I am so rooting for NS to get off the mark|pg||
nt|rv: 3n is best contract here though 4@s and 5@d make as well|pg||
nt|anton72: 5 @d looks 300|pg||
nt|maribelxx: Useful infor for partner|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sharkey: 2@S some kind of good raise after West's neg x?|pg||
nt|andyv:  any thoughts about 1N vs. 1@S on this one?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H shows a lot more in my book...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: at last we see the transfer-over 1@C- opening in action |pg||
nt|djneill: South doubles 3@c, ha|pg||
nt|jaheim: 2 NT prob 22-24 bal|pg||
nt|maribelxx: *info|pg||
mb|3D|nt|geot: Skriver det umiddelbart da,så har du det før kvelden, ok|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Leading the @C Jack might have been interesting|pg||
nt|rv: I might have opened 1@s even playing strong @c system with North hand|pg||
nt|stoffers: 2@d inverted maybe?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Feel 2@S a bit hard there. Ain't re X better?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i prefer the 1s overcall to start with and then later the takeout double as recommended in Robert Owen's excellent book on doubes etc|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Very much so!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same contract as OR.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1074140R  for running scores. This is the last match of the championships. Two segments of 16 boards|pg||
nt|stoffers: a spec sendt med this just now: urettferdig og dårlig gjort mot vikersund av harstad å stille med Kristensen inne i denne kampen.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 2d weak, I heard|pg||
nt|sharkey: perhaps - but why 2@H then?|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: West immediately signed off - I don't like that - 4 trumps and a little distribution|pg||
nt|sybarra: my say I am surpised we have not see a @D bid by N |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the W hand is not a 1 nt pattern for me |pg||
nt|djneill: what a @d suit :-)|pg||
nt|sybarra: my=must|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: NS also played the team final in Tønsberg some years ago. Don't remeber when but some spec might know.|pg||
nt|andersk: mee too|pg||
nt|rodal f: At board 6 OR was inside 7@S but N bidded 7NT:)|pg||
nt|maribelxx: I hear that summer has just begun in Norway too, very nice (we have +25C in Finland)|pg||
nt|stoffers: some of you have great humor i must say :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: if 2@D weak - i dont understand - S has loads to bid...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rodal f: U still have ure 3-4 in minor and heard 1@S at left side. HUM.|pg||
nt|rodal f: And same lead|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and had a second chance|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@D negative or waiting?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jaheim: Wd to stop in 4 @S|pg||
nt|rodal f: At aeria Ålesund it have been 0-7C by daytime til last 3 days by nice sunny weather. Now ca. 10-12C So hot for us and T-shirt on.|pg||
nt|maribelxx: Time to think first, not too many losers but you have to envisage your tricks too|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|djneill: anyways, good stop as North will be able to overruff @c|pg||
nt|djneill: even 1 @h pitch will not be enough (on the @d)|pg||
nt|stoffers: 2@h is normaly inverted for most players i would guess'|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|andersk: I feel sorry for førde now|pg||
nt|sharkey: ith 10 HCP and a pd who cuebids I wudnt stop at 3@D|pg||
nt|sharkey: *with|pg||
nt|sharkey: one of those "lykken er bedre enn forstanden" hands...|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rv: Anders, are these clubs sposored by any corporates or do players have to fend for their own expenses?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rv: yes if this was a boxing match, refree would have stopped contest:)|pg||
nt|andersk: Norwegian bridge federation i paying for the travel exspenses, and the clubs(usually) pay for the hotells etc.|pg||
nt|rv: good, atleast players don't have to spend too much from their pockets and can concentrate on the game|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andersk: My club pay for the hotell, and we players only have to pay for the food we eat (exsept from the food included in the hotell)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rodal f: % for 5@Sw and 1@S E is 7.25 Finding the A single behind make it down to 1.1% some said here.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with negative 2@D has no choice but to pass 4@S.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|james_h: Yes, all the expences are the down side of finding good competitions|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rodal f: Seems as that's done already:) And have a @H hook to use if needed.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Board 7 at OR also ended at 6@D by @H10 as lead.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Ringseth puts his card on the table and takes his time. Trying to find a way to set this.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to David Edwin|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jaheim: and 11 tricks,  maybee on a show up squeeze|pg||
nt|rv: unfortunately in most sports (except boxing), match continues till the end irrespective of margin at any stage|pg||
nt|anton72: 4 imps .. for Studentene R or S ?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anyway a good page to load: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm|pg||
nt|maribelxx: Something black perhaps , but which one|pg||
nt|maribelxx: Good afternoon David!|pg||
pc|dK|nt|anton72: i think R is correctly or i am wrong|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well that is a good reason why i want to get the spade off my chest at the one level|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rodal f: At 22 E opened with the 10 bad points and bidded his @S 5th 3 times. W ended at 4@HX and 800 for 11IMP.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: even with 2 @C discards has 11 tricks.|pg||
nt|ady: hi Lea|pg||
nt|maribelxx: A club brokes communication to take two heart ruffs|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzkn: Bremset tried to claim 12 but had to accept 11|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rodal f: As u said from ure place at eart Andy:) Standard 1NT opening in Norway I wrote 2 boards ago.|pg||
nt|rodal f: By there system I belive a bid is max 15HP bad. So need to X and bid for show 16 - 18(19)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|lestergold: we had more chance of getting tgo a sensible spot like in diamodns had we overcalled 1 spade to start with|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if there was a systematic bar then fair enough|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same u have by the new X for show cards. Can't see the problem.|pg||
nt|lestergold: competingin my view needs more flexible systems|pg||
nt|maribelxx: which might have been the way to find the necessary tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rodal f: I just wonder if S had the posebility for a 4@H bid after 2@S as exlution blackwood?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Grand has assumed the lead - OR went down in 4@H Bd 6 where Frank wanted to bid slam :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR here OR ended 3@S by minisplinter from E X at S and REX fromW as first control|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|rodal f: Again a thing by agreements.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|h_karluk: I choose 1@s|pg||
nt|maribelxx: with only ruff entry, he cannot take heart finesse|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as some forgot to take a trik in @D before this possision:)|pg||

nt|vugraphzbv: vikersund now only 3 Vps behind : http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1074140R|pg||
nt|rv:  all others bids on 1n doubled by South show 2 suiter with bid and higher suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|an|6!H 9-13|nt|rv:  playing DONT runouts, South redoubles with single suiter and rest of bids are DONT (that suit and higher suit)|pg||
nt|knutte: 2@H 6card and 8-11?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|knutte: 9-13 :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|geot: I dont know E/Ws system, but 2@H seems weird to me even if it is 9-13|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|rv:  even playing very sound pre-empts in second seat Vul, 2@h seems a bit heavy|pg||
nt|vugraphzbv: yesterday they opened - AJTxxx AQTxx Qx 2@h|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rv:  normally second seat pre-empts are sound since partner is more likely to have good hand and there is no point in pre-empting partner with poor hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: 9-13 and 6+ hearts|pg||
nt|geot: ok|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|rv:  I would have opened 3@h with East hand|pg||
pc|d8|nt|knutte: me too|pg||
nt|geot: you are not alone in the world if you do |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|jbgood: but then you wouldnt play 2@h showing 9-13 and 6+ hearts:)|pg||
nt|geot: exactly|pg||
nt|knutte: lol - probably not |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|rv:  yes agree Jon, he had his bid as per his system|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|geot: some specs suggest 1H is an alternative, and of course it is. But it is also an advantage by opening 3 as you put pressure on opponents. |pg||
nt|rv:  we are just suggesting what is popular treatment and hand evaluation/strategy playing normal pre-empts|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|geot: sure...and everyhing can work fine, of course|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  when the 5 card suit is @ss and you only have 2@h, it seems like 1@s is more efficient....if the 5 card suit is @H, then the advantage of 1N is a preemptive bid against @ss.|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be a relief to both in comparison to push that bd|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lestergold: wow grand!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Atthe OR W didn't bid so then 2@S was a normal bid.|pg||
nt|djneill: in the other room, North played a low @c from the Ace, getting a @c trick before the ruffing began|pg||
nt|djneill: then played loser on loser when West did ruff the 2nd @c|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rv: this is another hand to test NS resolve, they will do well to stop at 2 level in a partial|pg||
nt|sybarra: and what do they play here|pg||
nt|djneill: interesting canape|pg||
nt|djneill: canape means you bid a 4 card suit before the 5 card suit - sometimes not even not knowing which the 5 card suit is :-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: vul granny time folks|pg||
nt|sybarra: think it has another name|pg||
nt|sybarra: raptor? or |pg||
nt|rodal f: JH. Skoglund opend 2@D a major???? At N.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: bd 20 as we expected 6 @S very costly as the OR rested quietly in 4 @S|pg||
nt|djneill: East might pass this|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3NT at OR and a @C lead|pg||
nt|maribelxx: right, so he cleard the situation better :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B8 ended 3@S+1 at OR so 1IMPfor Namsos.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  boards 19 thru 22 have wiped out the Student's comeback|pg||
nt|h_karluk: looking into future is not a bad thing, however i am expected to tell partner what i have in my hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bad hand for forcing NT, one of many reasons why so many top players no longer play it, whereas not that long ago it was the norm|pg||
nt|rodal f: Inv minor 10HP+ at 2@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@h??|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Was told that NS was in the final in 2000 and 2004, so there 3rd one now.|pg||
nt|lestergold: south needs to try and take up max space here|pg||
nt|lestergold: feeble|pg||
nt|jaheim: pass?, strange bid  |pg||
nt|rodal f: Same end at OR if pass.|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 6@S if peeking at the spade position   but a poor contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Trouble if Skjetne puts up th @CQ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: So seems as bough EW tables lost the winning 3@S.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@C/@S on-slam time.|pg||
nt|jaheim: 6  @C @S and NT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: Would be the nice bid Mike:) Exlution to many pairs use to forget.|pg||
nt|lestergold: south shopul;d have donned brown corduroy trousers and barraged big time|pg||
nt|djneill: West has 9 HCP and a source of tricks vulnerable opposite 15-17, I hope West thinks this is forcing, and also hope East does|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: I didn't exspect the Q there. Had time to wait:(|pg||
nt|sharkey: Afraid of @S shift|pg||
nt|sharkey: This hand plays better Double Dummy - Skjetne's play not unreasonable |pg||
nt|sybarra: I will correct my statement, I actually would open 1 nt,  (for some reason I though he had 6 sp, hence the not my pattern)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah playing forcing NT they would get to 2@S.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wrong hand asking:(|pg||
nt|sharkey: coffee hand...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rv: Forde have opened their account|pg||
nt|maribelxx: This is the first half of this match from round 6. In this final stage 8 teams have qualified to play this weekend.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Skjetne got problems to tell the renons at @H and Forfot belive a singleton.|pg||
nt|maribelxx: and the club team championship will be decided in 7 matches, the last round to be seen on BBO tonight.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: 2S might well make, i was thinking of 3C|pg||
nt|hagz: OR 7 @c|pg||
nt|djneill: ok only way this goes down is if West ruffs high on the 3rd @c, but the @s6 then !7 is not from shortness - did South show 4@s specifically I wonder|pg||
nt|djneill: 3rd @s sorry|pg||
nt|rodal f: Am not shure if N see 4@C as que, but belive so. Anyway a easy slam.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: forgive the expression but being a money player ui dont like paying out to vul grannies|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well i dont fully understand bidding system, but was this that difficuklt a grand to reach|pg||
nt|rodal f: As Mike said.          The bid from W was 5@H over 3@H.|pg||
nt|lestergold: nol i said that south should have bid 5@h to take up space but having only bid 3@h west needed 5@h as unambiguous void showing and grand slam try|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wich at wourst can be 4N 3S? Had time to wait. Or what Carl?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some specs might wonder what 5@H would have ment.|pg||
nt|andersk: run @D 6 now|pg||
nt|jaheim: well this is a smokngboard 4 me,   my secretary will take over|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@S-3@H at S and at W in OR and end 6@S|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|jaheim: Hello I´m Ingrid Jan:s secretary|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|djneill: important to inquire about agreements, at least above the club level (then it just helps them )|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi|pg||
nt|rodal f: First big "swing it magistern".|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcwla: That's not happening -- at least not as a result of forcing NT.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, non-forcing NT would be a lovely idea if 1NT meant "I have a nice balanced minimum responding hand."|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andyv:  undertrick time|pg||
nt|jcwla: Unfortunately, much of the time it means "I have some shapely hand that doesn't have enough strength to bid at the 2 level."|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bidding small only wsas very expensive i think specs would mostly understand that as meaning the only thing it coluld mean|pg||
nt|rodal f: So u have started with employers out at the buch Jan Arne:) Out for some ice fishing?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 10 @S and claim please.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|maribelxx: I found the results on this page http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1074140|pg||
nt|rodal f: X at W sr specs|pg||
pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: yes it is fairly normal to bid 2S despite the poor holding and the good clubs--my point is that playing forcing NT really S has no idea of which black suit will be best|pg||
nt|rodal f: It's exslution blackwood. HOW many aces do u have pard exsept in @H|pg||
pc|c5|nt|djneill: South pitched a low @c, probably encouragement|pg||
nt|jaheim: next weekend|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: what was that 12 imps or so|pg||
nt|lestergold: and e/w cannot afford yhis sort of loss|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 6 clubs showed 2 aces and a void|pg||
nt|rv: they are not bagelled (6-0 in tennis) or got a pair (0 in cricket)|pg||
nt|anton72: he not take @s A??|pg||
nt|rodal f: When W enter at @DK in OR he need to play @HQ. And he is at the tank now.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: sry, shld be two. I will correct the movie|pg||
nt|anton72: aha|pg||
nt|rodal f: U'll do by no problem Geir:))|pg||
pc|cT|nt|djneill: which is important if North has the @cK and not the @sQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: there was a way to beat this,  but certainly no evidient to either n or s |pg||
nt|djneill: the @c8 would not be from @cK8 so South is not looking to return a @c - North surely would have led a stiff @c off the bat with a stiff|pg||

pc|d7|nt|djneill: ok|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharkey: If S were to lead @CJ dummy's @C7 becomes a stopper|pg||
nt|marlowepi: whereas if N can rebid 2C over NF 1N, S can afford to raise|pg||
nt|djneill: perhaps South is a bit confused about West's @h length|pg||

nt|vugraphzbv: that was the case last year|pg||

nt|jcwla:  There is a little bit of ambiguity in the black suits but non-forcing NT not the solution, imho.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Easiest is to use step by step in the beginning. S5@S=0      5NT=1      6@C=2 and 6@D new a ask if needed|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S made OR     must have guessed spade |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: by E?|pg||
nt|djneill: ok thanks Geir Harnes, who says that 2@s was indeed what shirley thought:  4@s + longer minor|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead but then did N know that S had clubs?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphzkn: thx|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: :-)|pg||
nt|andyv:  a multi 1@D bid:)|pg||
nt|rv: in last deal playing standard, if North rebids 2@h NS will stop at safe level, if North had rebid 2@d they could go overboard|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sharkey: On the previous board - I believe E had to finesse @H8 for 9th trick - even after a "friendly lead" - so very possible down OR as well|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@H-2 at OR on board 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Eliassen alerts with giving Allard the finger:) They ar good friends so no harm ment. He do not think they are up in the game I belive.|pg||
nt|rodal f: :) So was needed a place anyway.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Namsos picked up 6 IMPs on Bd 6 as Harstad reached 5@D OR|pg||
mb|d|an|negative|nt|h_karluk: I guess opening 1N when you've 5 cards good or bad M suit is just a gross distortion, you don't know the others. simplest example, you can save yr life starting with 1@H/@s and ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: suddenly yr lefty bids 1N(15-17) and yr p passes. Remember please, when your p has good values u dont have to worr abt anything, so just natural mostly works well with a little ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: luck|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a LOT of ambiguity, and if 1N nonforcing then a 2C rebid by N shows 4+ clubs which is an adavantage. the question is how big an advantage it will be, and how often, and ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how these pros and cons measure against all the other ones that must be entered into the balance sheet to evaluate the respective methods|pg||
nt|rodal f: Spot to come and 3@C as the best but will NS fight with 3@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Blood to come?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not sure everyone agrees with 1@H at these colors....|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, 2@S by an opener and a min responder on a 5-2 fit in preference to a notional 4-4 3@C will at least be reasonable -- non-forcing 1NT can lead to a contract that is just ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: preposterous.|pg||
nt|rv: not my choice of multi 2@d opening with that suit vul|pg||
nt|rodal f: Partscore at level 3 in major for bough?|pg||
nt|stoffers: 3NT best here as @d's are blocked|pg||
nt|sharkey: North's neg x is flawed, but under the circumstances probably best choice|pg||
mb|3D|nt|h_karluk: *worry|pg||
nt|djneill: West has flat 11, invite?|pg||
nt|anton72: 7 cards in suit ...but ...wrong numbers :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Think what damage I would do if I played this event...:|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: omg|pg||
nt|andersk: why didnt he pass and take out 2@S in 4 @H if that is the case|pg||
nt|rv: seems to be some confusion, 2@h double was intended as t/o or strong bal|pg||
nt|anton72: declarer have 10 and 9|pg||
mb|3H|nt|djneill: Studentenes BK is on the board finally with an imp!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: West won't mind defending either if pd has a @H stack|pg||
nt|rodal f: As a spec beside me tell. NS use minisplinter but here the 2NT invit came|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sharkey: Yes Frank - blood to come...|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Minimum 800 while 3NT also is on by 600.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Only problem for defence may be that West has no trump to lead thru|pg||
nt|rodal f: OK to show the 2 black colors by neg X, but might better to show 5 @S direct by 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: best to play some sohl (lebensohl, rubensohl, rumpelsohl) from South hand on double of 2@h by North|pg||
nt|james_h: oh man|pg||
nt|djneill: North went all out for extra tricks by underleading the @dKQJ :-) declarer's stiff @d8 won|pg||
nt|ady: poor opening by south   4-3-3-3 weak hand|pg||
nt|maribelxx: yes, he did guess spade - also a lot more bidding from opps|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: careful readers will note that at no point did i say that forcing NT is a bad method or that nonforcing NT is always the key to the city|pg||
nt|stoffers: He better duck this|pg||
nt|stoffers: Not that it matters :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: get out of dodge e/w!|pg||
nt|andyv:  aggressive fight for the part score|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am OK with terje's 1@d - rule of 20|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharkey: has to top out @HK|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|sybarra: imo,  no discussion needed about the 1 @D opening|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.bridgehands.com/R/Rule_of_20.htm|pg||
nt|jaheim: time to take toptricks now|pg||
nt|rv: a practical option is one suggested by Anders which is passing with South hand|pg||
pc|sK|nt|djneill: ok 11 flat may not be an invite, but vulnerable at imps, you don't think - you trust to the randomness of the cards that gives you imp odds for game: just 37% vulnerable game ...|pg||
nt|djneill: required to break even, and that is not counting bad defense|pg||
nt|stoffers: i bet a lot he dont..|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@S at OR. So a new gain by 3IMP|pg||
nt|rodal f: It was Geir Enge from the Namsos team who told me:) But Frode was more then strong enough.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sharkey: if he finds E with @CK might do so|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: looks like down 1|pg||
nt|maribelxx: Declarer is in trouble|pg||
pc|h6|nt|djneill: chance for the Studenten to get some extra credit|pg||

nt|jaheim: Modern D from W, 5 + sp  or max 3??|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: already been lucky to get 3 diamond tricks|pg||

nt|rodal f: At board 25.|pg||
nt|sharkey: play @C first?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: must bid farewell and leave you in Rodal's excellent hands|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|andyv:  esp. when you have the @s suit... makes most rebids easy|pg||
nt|ady: when you are in 1NT with a combined 19 hcp you will often be in trouble|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|ady: revised play looks like down 2|pg||
nt|maribelxx: luck revoked :)|pg||
nt|stoffers: might run into a @c ruff|pg||

nt|sharkey: not easy|pg||

pc|dT|nt|rodal f: and -1|pg||
pc|d4|nt|djneill: and South's @h pitch :-)|pg||
nt|djneill: either way, East should present a @h Jack or Ten, to induce a cover, even if really finessing the other way|pg||
nt|djneill: for instance, if East was on the board now, East could play the @hJ - planning on overtaking and hooking the other way|pg||
nt|djneill: North has no idea that East has the @hT so might just cover|pg||
nt|djneill: that extra chance takes you from 50% to maybe 70%, but here there are other clues to where the long @h are|pg||
nt|djneill: South doubled 1@h for takeout, so presumably has 8 @s and @d cards|pg||
nt|djneill: along with 2@c|pg||
nt|djneill: then South pitched a @h|pg||
nt|rodal f: Start tomorrow will be 10.00CET|pg||

nt|rodal f: Any comment from Harr by the lead Geir?|pg||

nt|rodal f: At OR they play 28 now and  open 2@H. |pg||
nt|rnmalik: possible if they bid.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: NS having a chat under the screen now.."Terrible lead", Harr says, but he still smiles:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: NS can make 4@H; will they bid it after West's overcall?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will W try to bid or will NS find there best contract?|pg||

mb|p|nt|rv: nearly impossible with only 4 brds remaining|pg||

nt|h_karluk: then Terje shldnt pass|pg||
nt|jcwla: A number of unappetizing choices here for W.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Do you prefer 4@H or 4@S on this hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Assume 2@D kind of @H raise|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit surpriced that EW didn't hold it for 11 when W came by the 3@C bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: At OR.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: If @H is 3-3 u don't have any problem. But id 4-2     2-4     and K doubble?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: sry Frank|pg||

nt|sharkey: I wud Dbl|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@D as a @H raise I agree Carl, but how strong?:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: After East's 1@H opening|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks weak to me :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: prefect fit this time |pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: interesting cue|pg||
nt|rodal f: Jacoby and splinter on now|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like hand was made overly complicated|pg||
nt|mcarroll: oops|pg||
nt|djneill: I think @cAKQxx opposite a 1@c opening is a bit encouraging, more than just 9 HCP|pg||
nt|maribelxx: Always awkward situations when opps disturb you|pg||
nt|stoffers: 3@h high enough seing the cards together, but splits friendly here so i guess he will make it in comfort|pg||
pc|s3|nt|maribelxx: ...or your bidding :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: No normal chance to bid the slam as I see or might Lars have a route 66?|pg||
nt|jaheim: strange bidding|pg||
nt|rodal f: KX at as the hook is correct and KX at N it's correct to play @H from AQXX|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|rodal f: :) But I belive the Students might made a well needed winning bid.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: This is a variation of the Jacoby 2 No Trump used in Limit Raises. |pg||
nt|james_h: bomb proof, just what NS were hoping for|pg||
pc|s7|nt|h_karluk: SWEDISH JACOBY 2 NO TRUMP |pg||

pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: This is a variation of the Jacoby 2 No Trump used in Limit Raises.|pg||
nt|djneill: East is a passed hand, not vulnerable, and does not bid 1@s, interesting - I think 1-level is for everyone|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|rodal f: So 5 IMP|pg||
nt|rodal f: After 4@H Mr. Haram shure lost interess:)|pg||

nt|maribelxx: How to make 12 tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn:  Flått lay down his cards and says he will play on a possible squeez for 12. Claiming time is back!!|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jbgood: bidding may suggest heart ace and another|pg||

nt|jaheim: mm,  i dont think that NS are looking forward to the half time comparasing|pg||

nt|vugraphzkn: Something wrong with the cards. They know the hands. Getting TD to check now. Going to 16 first.|pg||

nt|sybarra: and the X is?  "cards"  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3 in a row 4@s|pg||
nt|jcwla: Evjen failed in 3NT on 13 in the OR - so the rout is on.|pg||
nt|sybarra: well that overcall keeps n/s out of their ht "fit" |pg||
nt|jbgood: woodgrovers bid them up in the open room, but .... |pg||
nt|maribelxx: Yes, east was squeezed in @S and @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: On Bd 14 S Dbl OR but failed to bid 4@S over 4@Hso looks like a push|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be Shirley|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 5T contrat desire|pg||
nt|james_h: but 6d maked|pg||
nt|james_h: makes|pg||
nt|rv: interesting defensive problem here|pg||
nt|djneill: lol|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Surely does|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|rodal f: They are playing with screens so the thinking don't matter that much as at open tables.|pg||
nt|stoffers: i muche prefer 1@s here than double|pg||
mb|1S|nt|djneill: well, kind of :-)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sharkey: Hartvigsen's 3@C VUL not for the faint hearted....|pg||
nt|jcwla: A light passed-hand double by W - usually a good idea.|pg||
nt|djneill: N-S are playing in @h anyways, for 50 a pop|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: He said sorry and that he was frustrated by the slam play.|pg||
nt|stoffers: i am not stron enough to double and bid that @s suit'|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: Who know Shirley?:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: My way by thinking was. @C4 have to be from a honor or singel. Then @CQ is free befor the @D test for -1 but u loose the max -2 It's team and not match.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rodal f: I understand Remvik's 4@C. Hartvigsen should have been a bit stronger for his 3@C bid.|pg||
nt|hagz: 5 @c makes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with only one ace, i think 3N is very dubious. 3H better then if S bids 3N fine|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@H=4@S and 4@C splinteer.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|djneill: we can see North has opened 1@d instead of 1@h, with the same 4432 shape|pg||
nt|jbgood: no comment|pg||
nt|jbgood: i guess 2 @c is either dimonds or both majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Long talk between south and west, and now between vest and east|pg||
nt|rodal f: X for S=3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Neg use to be normal.|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty all...wonderful show put on by all... and ty specs for your comments and help|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S snatches defeat from the jaws of victory - again|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But E gets in on the act|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2 times @H and @C give a pitch in @D at E and slam are on.|pg||
nt|jbgood: so 2 @s - and nobody agreed on 2@s |pg||
nt|stoffers: easy when you can bid 1@s, but what if 1@c-x-2@c-4@h-p and its your turn?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: and S again - again|pg||
nt|rv: North should duck first and second @hs to set this contract|pg||
nt|jaheim: when i played bridge on a high level, I always took a break and a smoke after a stupid mistake,  it helped me,  but still many smokingbreakes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: One of those hand that plays well if pd just have trumps...|pg||
nt|sharkey: @D lead wud have ensured defeat|pg||
pc|h2|nt|djneill: so East can play this as if he is defending @h |pg||
nt|djneill: unfortunately, there is no @s finesse when N-S can see West's hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: which sh have been pass or correct|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rodal f: 4@S at OR and @C lead on 30 so might some promblems there. But normaly 10 trick by cross ruffs.|pg||
nt|stoffers: If Harr has shown a good hand here i think Bremset is underbidding his hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rv: now he should hop with @sA and cash out|pg||
nt|rv: not easy at all|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jcwla: And Smith failed in 3NT on 14 -- so the lead plumps to 40.  Welcome to all who've joined us from the OR.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|djneill: 4@s was reached in the other room, and the 500 did score a few imps for E-W|pg||
pc|c6|nt|larsarthur: flat board here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N could bid 3D too, but 3H sends more of a message that N is worried about spades|pg||
nt|stoffers: over 2@h he should bid 3@s or similar|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|maribelxx: Taking the aces is helpful for the declarer|pg||
pc|cK|nt|djneill: if I was N-S and I knew about the 5-0 @h break, I would do anything but bleed all the trumps|pg||
nt|djneill: so defenders here should do likewise|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sharkey: @C lead works as well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 9 hcp, no trump support, perhaps 3C wld be mistaken, so easy X in competition|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  good session for BK Grand which was able to stretch out it's lead|pg||
nt|james_h: right, the club situation not clear for N|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|james_h: up to that point|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mcarroll: a double would have led to a 71-0 score|pg||
nt|rv: these small contracts of playing and defending 1n just don't get adequate rewards in IMPs scoring|pg||
pc|s8|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Trick one will cost many tricks now:(|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Probably makes no difference to the final result|pg||

nt|djneill: it may come down to the @c guess|pg||
nt|djneill: but there are endplay possibilities in @s too - @s and another means South will win and possibly give a ruff-sluff|pg||
nt|djneill: as North did not lead the @sK, there is small hint that South has doubleton honor|pg||
nt|djneill: @sQ here may solve it|pg||
