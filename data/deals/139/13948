pc|hK|nt|idc: Mind you, I'm working from a 2007 CC but I don't think they have changed much recently|pg||
nt|athene: east has to give his partner a club ruff to get the diamond through|pg||
nt|athene: not an easy defence to find|pg||
nt|athene: usually you don't rush to give partner a ruff if you have a natural trick in the suit anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: mucho thought from E|pg||
nt|athene: because it's just wasting a trump|pg||
nt|athene: maybe east can work this out though - clearly, given time, declarer is conceding a club and throwing his diamonds away|pg||
nt|idc: He needs to find 4 tricks from somewhere, and the options aren't great|pg||
nt|idc: so he may find it|pg||
nt|athene: east knows his partner has only two trumps (at most) so there isn't the danger of making him ruff with a trump trick|pg||
nt|athene: but still, if you lead into the jaws of that club tenace and it's wrong, you look very silly|pg||
nt|pitiful:  maybe he can duck, win 2nd @h and play 3rd @h?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: still finking|pg||
nt|pitiful:  what does declarer do?|pg||
nt|athene: he might do that but it's no good - declarer just plays a small club and that's that|pg||
nt|pitiful:  yes very good|pg||
nt|pitiful:  a nice hand|pg||
nt|idc: Knows declarer has 4 trumps & 5 clubs - presuambly also one of @sA / @dQ|pg||
nt|idc: so that makes 10 if he goes passive|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: everyone has folded cards and placed on table |pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: action?  maybe?  more sighing from East!|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: he's picked up cards, but frowning at dummy|pg||
nt|athene: east will be wondering if the defence can somehow come to a spade trick|pg||
nt|athene: for example duck this one, win the next trump, and play a spade - now if west has something in spades, you might be able to cash a spade and the @DA when you win the @CQ|pg||
nt|athene: but probably declarer has the @SA - there isn't much else for him to have|pg||
nt|athene: her, sorry|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|idc: 6@d quite good, time to break out the popcorn|pg||

nt|athene: 1@D works out ok if partner isn't so churlish as to pass|pg||
nt|athene: and no-one passes opening bids these days so i guess it's ok|pg||
nt|paulg:  John Matheson says that 6@c is the better contract, but that would be some auction|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: yes, strong club + relays might get there, but even then, the @CJ is cruical, so i can't see it happening|pg||
nt|athene: crucial even|pg||
nt|idc: He's right as usual: 6@d involves guessing whether to ruff 3rd round of @s high or not once finesse loses|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: W turn to have long think|pg||
nt|paulg:  i thought that they might play 2NT as a weak call here, but clearly not|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: not alerted, so assume not|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: it's common to play 2nt as a weakness bid over a reverse but not a game-forcing jump shift, i don't think?|pg||

nt|athene: yes 3@C might put east in a position to go for 6@C|pg||
nt|paulg:  I wonder if West would open 1@c with 4=1=4=4|pg||
nt|idc: Mind you, in 6@c a @d lead would be awkward; takes away an entry to E hand once you have ruffed a @h|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: hmmm 4@C is the sort of bid that can be very murky without good agreements|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|nt|athene: i suppose it's a cue for diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgt: damn says West, he was going to bid that|pg||
nt|idc: so you may need @d 3-2 after that lead - not so much beter than 6@d perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: 5nt pick-a-slam is a common bid in this sort of auction when no-one has a clue what trumps are|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: now it'll be his fault!  Mucho laughs|pg||
nt|idc: but these are minor quibbles - both are good contracts|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgt: E has head in hands, and passes!|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok, very well done indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgt: 2N not Leb, just natural, 3@c might be 3 card suit says, E|pg||
nt|paulg:  A very thoughtful auction|pg||
nt|idc: They both know this could be 4-3 fit I'm sure, though West hopes for a 5th @c opposite and East may hope for 4-0-5-4|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: N pondering lead.......... |pg||
nt|pitiful:  what would the panel lead?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: it would be nicer to have all teams playing the same boards, though|pg||

nt|jallerton: same in most midweek leagues round the country, which are usually played at people's houses|pg||
nt|patricck: Indeed it was a good contract, but with @H 3-0 the defence really wasn't too difficult to beat it|pg||
nt|lark20: A diamond slam seems possible|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|yr: great performance by both the finalists, & the team which held its nerve emerges as the national champions of 2010|pg||
nt|patricck: collecting 800, 1100 or even 1400 would be better than making a non vul 4@H tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: wondered what you folk were talking about..|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jtr: Dont like the system at all if they cant reach 4@h|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: you talk from experiance, patrick|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|patricck: meanwhile this looks like a push result. 4@S a reasonable contract but needed some of the trumps onside|pg||
nt|iain sime: This is an unlucky 4@S bid in both rooms. So Steel has an 11 imp lead (scores reversed on scoresheet). |pg||
nt|garnetts: easier if the first bid is 1@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|yr: they will represent pakistan in the commonwealth games schedualed later this year in new dehli India|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lark20: Not normal in Scotland|pg||

nt|idc: East might have found a higher @d for suit preference had he the @hA|pg||
nt|idc: but just a straw in the wind|pg||

mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: Good evening Roland|pg||

nt|patricck: 2@H?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jallerton: can N/S stop out og game?|pg||
nt|jallerton: *of|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|jtr: Did well to stop, sort of, at the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: @H and a minor|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: I assume all balanced hands are opened 1@C by the N-S pair in the closed room|pg||
nt|patricck: certainly frisky, even at the vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: yes, it's a shame South opened a non-systemic 1@C|pg||
nt|patricck: N/S can do very well in hearts, but difficult to know which one of them was supposed to enter the auction|pg||
nt|iain sime: North South have missed a decent 4@H here.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: Oh, is it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: trump lead sort of marked here|pg||
nt|jtr: Some open 1@c on any balanced hand|pg||
nt|jtr: But not this pair it seems?|pg||
nt|jallerton: no, both N/S pairs systemically open 1@D with 4|pg||
nt|jtr: My style too|pg||
nt|jallerton: at this stable, East seems to have bid some of North's hand|pg||
nt|patricck: 3 rounds of trumps stops 4@H I think|pg||
nt|iain sime: It looks like that means only five hearts and four tricks in the minors, but wheer there is nine a tenth often appears.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|wilkinsona: sure, but having done it and struck gold, passing 3 clubs fails to put the pressure on|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have always thought that the sort of intervention by west is well worth the risk--I suspect the problem is that East did not bid enough--anyone for 3NT and not 3@C |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: declrer may read this lead as a singleton|pg||
nt|patricck: Going up with the A@H will make declarer's task a lot harder|pg||
nt|garnetts: This has all the hallmarks of playing badly if it is a singleton--so probably worth the risk it isn't|pg||
nt|patricck: But can he really play low? I wouldn't have thought so|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: north taking his time..as well he might as the lines are not clear|pg||
pc|h3|nt|garnetts: I think it is worth the risk |pg||
nt|patricck: well done|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pros and cons. The advantage of opening 1@C on 2+ is that 1@D is 5+ unless 4441|pg||

pc|c9|nt|jallerton: "transferred king" with an opponent is a new concept|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|iain sime: Bidding 4@H might have stampeded East into 5@C minus one. |pg||
pc|c4|nt|jtr: Makes a change, he usually bids both opponents cards|pg||

nt|paulg:  so about 40 minutes from us|pg||
nt|athene: west has a big hand facing a 1@C-2@D reverse|pg||
nt|athene: certainly they will play at least 6@C now|pg||
nt|idc: Same start as OR, but West had to jump to 3NT and that left East no room to continue|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: this set has seen two boards where opening 1minor instead of 2nt leads to slam|pg||
nt|idc: Well, I say "had to jump" but I don't think he did|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: although to be fair you might well reach 6@C even if you open 2nt with east's hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: pressure still on as slam time comes|pg||
mb|1C|nt|patricck: an excellent slam, not really good enough odds to bid the grand slam, although it does happen to make|pg||

mb|p|nt|iain sime: John Holland is a current English international from Manchhester. Clive owen is also English from Darlington.|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: Hmmm  Struggling with that|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: That is in my view a dreadful bid |pg||
nt|lark20: Oh dear!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lilac9: 3c here looks like a good limit raise in hearts|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...in these situations the club suit is back in the pack..|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jtr: It must be western Turkish i think|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jallerton: Garvey could be struggling in 1@sx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I wonder why Hinden did not sit for it in the other room|pg||
nt|jtr: Taking some cash here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Perfect vulnerability to pass|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|iain sime: I wouldn't like to predict the outcome- Steel are probably slight favourites.|pg||
nt|patricck: Its an unusual situation, but West should have had enough confidence in what partner would need to make that bid. He should have passed 2@S|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|wilkinsona: there must be a forcing way of showing support|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes i was thinking that before the Turkish element crept in|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|garnetts: 2@S first is perhaps best after 2@D--then say east bids 3NT which likely shows a 5-4-2-2 hand then 4@C seems right|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jallerton: in other room, rdbl showed 4+@h, dbl was support, showing 3 hearts|pg||

nt|Walddk2: It still seems normal to convert|pg||
nt|jallerton: I agree, I would have passed too|pg||
nt|jtr: It translates as "Special systems to improve" apparently|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you can make 3NT, they will go for a phone number|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d2|nt|lark20: Holland couldn't have done any more.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: it's one of the reasons why you redouble in the first place|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, phone numbers used to be shorter|pg||
nt|jallerton: but this may only be 1 off in fact|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT is just awful--maybe say the same hand in the majots with xxx and xx in the minors|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d4|pc|h4|pg||
nt|iain sime: Yes, this is not agreat contract and could go down several.|pg||
nt|patricck: I'm thinking that North should have got a red card out for 4@C...  How likely is it that E/W could make anything at the 4 level when the clubs are clearly placed the way they are|pg||
nt|iain sime: Again it is interesting to speculate how many hearts NS would have made.|pg||
