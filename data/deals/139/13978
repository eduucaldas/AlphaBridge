nt|jtr: But maybe it is a case of 'who is making what'|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 3C a very questionable action in 2nd seat with a likely running suit, unless of course partner expects this|pg||

nt|marlowepi: apparentl every E at this table would:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: bd 20  5 @C X made at the other table |pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: indeed needs some luck from the bridge gods to survive here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|garnetts: 5@D no play on a club lead |pg||
nt|garnetts: 4NT natural?|pg||
nt|garnetts: This needs sorting in serious partnerships |pg||
nt|roswolf: the bidding may have helped though a spade lead is likely from east|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4nt should be an attempt to play there i think|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree Geoff--a spade seems obvious|pg||
nt|garnetts: three potential bids 4NT  5@C  5@D  |pg||
nt|garnetts: Not 4@H |pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|garnetts: Hadn't considered that |pg||
nt|roswolf: trying to be objective as possible i think 5@D was better|pg||
nt|roswolf: no and i think too aggressive|pg||

nt|garnetts: might play three rounds but no entry |pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|roswolf: 3@S backfired - but very tough to find the club lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: strange example of a pre-empt doing exactly the opposite of what was intended|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Dummy is reading a magazine|pg||
nt|roswolf: the israelis seem to have fortune on their side|pg||
nt|garnetts: Maybe there is a case for west doubling --or for east to consider the implications of the 4@S bid--note west passed|pg||

nt|Walddk6: Hi Walter, welcome|pg||
nt|jtr: Some safety with the 3 @ss|pg||
nt|daman: I take the flip side and pass|pg||
nt|jtr: And the opponents are limited and partner hasn't bid @hs|pg||
nt|daman: committing our side to the 3 level with that collection would give me indigestion|pg||
nt|bigtrain: with all his secondary values in the minors and the opponents having limited values - i think the balance is a standout|pg||
nt|jtr: However, Winkiboy do have a substantial lead|pg||
nt|jtr: Which would influence matters|pg||

nt|jtr: Seems to be updating well now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: generally, the partner with the short trump needs to aggressively enter the auction which would indicate action by N|pg||
