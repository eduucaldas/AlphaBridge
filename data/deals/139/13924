nt|jaapfr: are EW female students:)?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Also part of the explanation why when it's not clear who owns the hand or who can make what, the 5 level belongs to the opponents.|pg||
nt|lestergold: why do i call you Frank it should be Rodal its psychological sorry|pg||
nt|jaheim: strange 6 sp with only K8xx in @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: EW plays 5-5-4-2 and transfers after 1cl openings|pg||
nt|djneill: in fact, I wonder why South didn't act earlier :-)  12 HCP good 5 card suit NV|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|djneill: does anyone know if East is related to Geir Helgemo|pg||

nt|rodal f: A hard one from W but I belive Erik will bid. But will they reach 4?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: another @S contract,  better trumph this time  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Or a auto stop at 2@H?|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h should make |pg||
nt|rodal f: Looks as Ekrens 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: it is |pg||
nt|jaheim: but 9 tricks max|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - 8 to be exact - both ways|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: A rarity - a weak 2@D opener|pg||
nt|sharkey: the previous board was down 2 - not 1 - will be corrected|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to find A@c and Q@c lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: good vuln save|pg||
nt|andyv:  down at least 500|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx Torstein:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes they may stretch too far on this one too|pg||
nt|djneill: how many @s now, shirley?|pg||
nt|djneill: 2@s, 3@s seem the options|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: This contract is playable by a dobble hook in @C|pg||
nt|hagz: 3 NT makes, 6 @c makes|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sharkey: looks reasonable - unless the 4-1 @H break becomes a problem|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here is a good example of a hand that natural bidders should open 1@D.|pg||
nt|larsarthur: south is not sure about @dfit|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Marshall Lewis|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hi all :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Must be prepared for all continuations -- here, 1@D and then 3@C and you feel much better than this.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@c seems a better contract ironically|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  now it's serious:)|pg||
nt|larsarthur: lowest 4-card is std in Norway|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Marshalll.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|hagz: Hard to guess @s in 3 NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Just one thing left to do! Bid the 6er....|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually isnt 3n a trick short on a heart lead?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharkey: A @D lead appears to be best for defence|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S had only 4 losers imo|pg||
nt|jcwla: Interesting to know but that doesn't begin and end the conversation for me in terms of how best to describe this hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Anders Kristensen and GeO Tislevoll (partly)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk5: Running scores at  http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1074140R|pg||

nt|rodal f: Wander what's gona happen in OR at this? |pg||
pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: there are arguments on both sides, but you aren;lt getting full value for money out of sputnik if you follow the same sequence with this S hand and also on   xx  AKx   xx  Axxxxx|pg||
nt|james_h: tricky rebid in normal systems for south, no such difficulty here 1@s must be 5?|pg||
nt|rv: 1@s possibly shows 5@s here|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi folks!|pg||
nt|geot: Hi friends:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 1 spade was not forcing|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Andres, wlc|pg||
nt|james_h: Hi Geo|pg||
nt|djneill: 3@s shows an unbalanced hand typically, but occasionally 4522 - East has a sharp hand, so at IMPs the idea is to just bid game and hope to make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice name to have going into competition |pg||
nt|djneill: yep|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  on @s lead, can N still hold it down to only 4 losers?|pg||
nt|andyv:  without dbl dummying the @c suit?|pg||
nt|james_h: Hi Anders|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodal f: If any want to look at the pairs systemcards u find them here: http://www.nmlag.com/Systemkort til the turney is fin|pg||
nt|jcwla: When the clubs are significantly stronger or you will be able to handle all continuations, I have no problem with 1@C.  Here, a rebid problem such as this was reasonably likely.|pg||
nt|hagz: yeah, there is only one entrance the the dummy to get the @s tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This might have - regarding the bidding - about 7Â½ % chance to make|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: i suppose 2d sgowing i assume 4 spades might pick them|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant be done really |pg||
nt|hagz: Can't get them|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to make a decision as to how to tackle the diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: can play i suppose to ruff 2 hearts in dummy|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you ask then too much|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in other words, i think the disadvantages of 1C outweight the advantages|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andersk: If you all look at the butler scoores, then you understand why Im here and not playing:)|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|sharkey: makes with the hool|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sharkey: W wud be better off returning @DQ and E had to duck.  Think that would have ensured 1 down on overruff|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive this will end -3 and 150 while NS have 10 in @S. So 1 or 10 IMP gain for Singsås it seems.|pg||

nt|geot: sure. We have all been there:)|pg||
nt|andersk: lets see if Hjelmeland can male this|pg||
nt|andersk: make|pg||
nt|rv: declarer needs to take @s finesse, if he plays @s from top, 4-1 break might scuttle the contract|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkey: Not many use weak 2@D opener - I believe it sometimes is very effective|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway -500 not too bad for NS:)|pg||
nt|djneill: there is a general rule that against 3-suiters, you want to lead trumps - it is just a rule that works - and West has a semi-3suited hand, so South's trump switch was reasonable|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|andyv:  true|pg||
nt|andyv:  vs. 550:)|pg||
nt|andersk: probably misses it now|pg||
nt|james_h: If this score was a mountain, I'd stay at base camp :)|pg||
nt|rv: he might go down playing for 3-2 break|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|lestergold: cant go wrong as cards lie|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe he will top play, since they are 65 behindf|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcwla: On Board 1, 5@D was doubled in the OR and made on the lead of the @CT.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 9 tricks the limit - can set up a long @H for @C discard|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hagz: wd|pg||
nt|andersk: and he did|pg||
nt|djneill: nothing to say here, 3-3 @h and 3-2 @s|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  ok, I'm blind... where did the @d loser go?|pg||
nt|djneill: other room starting with the end of the set: brds 15 and 16, so we will get results in a few minutes for brd 1|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: S hand a reasonable opening at these colors|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will they try a new hard one NS?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nope.|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie e/w has more play for 4@s than n/s has for 4@h in spite of the hcp distribution in n/s favour|pg||
nt|lestergold: north passing i assume a strong nt holding a 9 count??|pg||

pc|s7|nt|sharkey: no - sunny Stavanger :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect if D were Kxx and clubs KQxx, he would have been more likely to open|pg||
nt|djneill: ok @h lead which gives up the suit, but if South ducks, there goes the entry to the @c, so South should rise with the @hA|pg||

nt|jcwla: Pass seems normal on the actual hand, though reasonable intermediates and medium spots make it look not totally watered-down.|pg||
nt|andersk: still 4 matches to go, and a long way to go, so medal is still possible if we improve!|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I second that; I have been in that position too often for comfort|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once again it may be systemic, but i am not keen on the sequence chosen by E here. Even facing a PH, this E hand has significant game potential in a suit, so i would want to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maximize our opportunities to show suits|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 20 HCP and 4 card support for pard, e will be disappointed there is no Grand slam|pg||
nt|james_h: I do sometimes do in the last segment of the Bermuda Bowl when 16+ behind|pg||
nt|rv: @C lead and @d switch required to beat this which is double dummy defebse|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzkn: V, but there also seems to be a wrong explenation so we will see.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sharkey: been here a while now - only leave during cold season...|pg||
nt|jaheim: Flått is prob thinking about the Q of @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: They picked up the cards wrong so Flått opened in 1 heart. All bids alerted after 1 heart.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s what I doÂ´nt like with 2 NT - how many @H has West - you never know|pg||
nt|rv: normal @d lead should result in 10 tricks|pg||
nt|andersk: When all 5 players have been under pari, it is not easy. The easy part is that we cant blame any but ouhrselves:)|pg||
nt|djneill: yes, only way for more than 10 is if opponents pitch hearts and spades|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rv: Anders, are the top Norwegian pairs like Helgemo-Helness, Grotheim-Tundal, Brogeland-pd playing this event?|pg||
nt|andersk: No|pg||
nt|andersk: They are not qualyfied (Im not sure if they played from start)|pg||
nt|james_h: and Geo has gone south for the Spring|pg||
nt|geot: :)|pg||
nt|andersk: This event is played like 6 rounds of knockout matches, then 8 teams meet for a final long weekend|pg||
nt|james_h: and NZ dollars :)|pg||

pc|hK|nt|andyv:  question really is if E should leave the 2N bid in|pg||
nt|jaapfr: good question imo:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 6NT to guard the @S tenace|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c3|nt|jcwla: Eh la la.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jaapfr: but 3@C will get a X by S|pg||

nt|jaheim: soon  next board  zzzzzzzz|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|djneill: South is pressurizing E-W with the long suit - sometimes odd things happen|pg||

nt|vugraphzkn: N diddent see pds 1nt opening|pg||
nt|andersk: top 8 club teams, this year:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I think e/w will try 4 @S here at the end of the day |pg||
nt|jaapfr: still   Studentenes sounds very female to me but do not master Norwegian|pg||
nt|andyv:  S took a far more aggressive stance on board 1 and found the excellent save of 5@d for 9 imp gain|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR|pg||
nt|rv: so quality of bridge on display should definitely be of high standard|pg||
nt|djneill: that @h suit was an example of keeping the final contract in sight, and not mechanically play the suit by itself |pg||
mb|1C|nt|sharkey: On Board 1 Studentenes have picked up 11 IMPs - not 10.  6@S at this table was off 2.  This will be corrected|pg||
nt|rodal f: By his 9HP Forfot ain't fare away for a normalopening.|pg||
mb|2C|an|Michaels|nt|sharkey: Shud be some action here?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sharkey: 3@C some kind of mixed raise?|pg||

nt|rodal f: So by the screens N are same blind I am witout screens?:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah that explains |pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: funny faces in here :-)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharkey: So far NS have not been able to introduce their @D suit - may be too late now|pg||
nt|sybarra: or will E venture 3 nt at some point |pg||
nt|andyv:  actually N deserves the credit for dbling 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: West opens a feather light vulnerable 1@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: we also have another team event plaing like a premier leuage, two 2. divisjons 8 3. divisjons etc, premier leuage is the top team event, this is the top club team event|pg||
nt|rv: do EW play standard or a limited system?|pg||
nt|james_h: Any kibs have outline system info?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 5-5-4-2 with transfers after 1cl openings|pg||
nt|djneill: unsupported Queen and Jack are dubious|pg||
nt|anton72: trum lead beat it|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: south cannot make anything at the 3 level|pg||
nt|sybarra: but its a good hand! |pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharkey: Kib informs 3@C asks for strength and suit quality|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6!@S probably down 1 although 5@S likely to be +1|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sharkey: 3 NT shows max|pg||
nt|rodal f: U have the funniest any way Torstein:) I will come to Ålesund tomorrow non. Will be nice to see u again.|pg||
nt|djneill: you like the long @d suit shirley?  looks nice|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6/4 with spades |pg||
nt|mcarroll: not quite a Roland 19-21 and it looks like the 19 count wins|pg||
nt|djneill: welcome martin|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: NS precision club|pg||
nt|andersk: normally there are 5-8 very good teams in this team final, some years the level is not abselout top|pg||
nt|geot: The nightmare for Førde seems to continue. The 4@S North went down in here (board 18) was played in 4@H at the other table, won by Cantona Nybo. 13 impsmore|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Dan, Shirley|pg||
nt|djneill: ok so another entry-related hand|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|sharkey: so wise of NS to stay out of the bidding as appears 5@D x wud be off 800|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jaapfr: good leading technique|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|rv: par contract is 5@d for EW though 4@s makes as well|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like PA is trying to play 4@S |pg||
pc|h3|nt|geot: In 5@D you have to guess the trumps|pg||
nt|james_h: another reason to take the normal line|pg||
nt|djneill: pretty much no way to get to the @d so East must duck a @d, even if South covers|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  W's 5@s bid asked for what?|pg||
nt|andyv:  club control or trump?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @S support i say|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi:) Normaly trumh cuality.|pg||
nt|andyv:  if so, then 6@s was optomistic by E|pg||
nt|rodal f: quality*|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even wrong bid E|pg||
nt|rv: how many brds per round, we seem to have started off with a huge score in favor or Namsos BK?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: as he does|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcwla: Will we get a failing @H finesse?|pg||
nt|geot: 16 boards|pg||
nt|andersk: 16 a round  32 a match|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently systemic to open 1H on the W hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|larsarthur: how can it fail?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sharkey: i predict 10 tricks - probably wrong again....|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jaapfr: better claim down 1 to make dummy not too ashamed:)|pg||
nt|rv: East will pass and West will bid 5@d to deny first round control|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|geot: So easy for us, seeing all cards.....to play the trumps without a loser. Not that easy at the table|pg||
nt|james_h: indeed|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|rv: if cue bid is doubled by opps, redouble shows first round control, bidding another suit shows cue in that suit and promises second round control of suit|pg||
nt|djneill: so South must think - is there a possible layout that gives us 3 more tricks outside of @d immediately|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if the EW carding is to be believed, the heart queen is with E|pg||
nt|andersk: might get the @D right now, since N doubled 5@C|pg||
nt|rodal f: b|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same contract at OR|pg||
nt|rodal f: And same lead. OR|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|rodal f: Mildly said. E is Erlend Skjetne fro the Norwegian Junior team older.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @S seemed a bit much in the first place|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Stop the E/W wagon, I want to get off|pg||
nt|rv: once partner doesn't super-accept your transfer, you would tend to pass with 8 hcp and invite only with 9 on 5332 or 5422 shape|pg||
nt|james_h: 4s easier in practice|pg||
nt|andersk: Førde again trying to get back by bidding too much|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|rodal f: You as many others would have done I belive. It's only a @C lead that keep them of 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|djneill: knowing the split - any singleton with East leaves 4 @d losers, North is not unhappy to let West ruff|pg||
nt|djneill: when West passes a 2-level takeout, it shows a stack|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  I see more of an advantage for DONT in direct seat... in pass out seat, something simpler might be better|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||

nt|lestergold: yje stiff hert is an obvious value to N but how can he know how imprtant the Q@c is?|pg||
nt|djneill: ok a 3crd @h raise - it is fine but takes a little judgement or gadgetry to then show that - I think requiring 4 cards is a reasonable agreement|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: S is being pragmatic opening the 5 card @S suit - this in order he'll be able to show both suits|pg||

nt|lestergold: well i dont think there is any harm in sp[lintering ion the way f u are prepared to jumop to 4 level in any case|pg||
nt|djneill: South must guard @s and @c|pg||

pc|c8|nt|anton72: A @c .... ruff @d with J 2 trumps ...ruff @c ... we are in home|pg||

nt|andyv:  ty!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has a choice oer 1S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Best idea is to claim - |pg||
nt|rv: one of the reasons K/O matches are preferred in final stages of ACBL and World events is because of this strategy of teams not doing well playing anti-percentage bridge|pg||

nt|sharkey: Slam on a finesse|pg||
nt|rodal f: But will get 2 aces away by 4NT.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: useful for NS to play transfers in this situation|pg||
nt|sybarra: may hear screeching of brakes at both tables |pg||
nt|djneill: true, 3-4 support is more encouraging than 3crd after a checkback sequence|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  agree, Hamdi... that's what makes this game so fascinating|pg||
nt|sybarra: N can be pretty sure it is no spades in S hand |pg||

nt|rodal f: But a interestin @C contract EW.|pg||
nt|rv: in Round Robin, teams not doing well can really upset the field by not playing seriously|pg||

nt|andersk: unbalanced GF|pg||
nt|james_h: 3?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  W not elated with the dbl|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The defence to the Multi Two Diamonds is fundamentally different from the defence to a weak two for a number of reasons: |pg||
nt|andyv:  2N leb?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then can raise to 2S in two different ways, distinguishing pure obstruction from some genuine values|pg||
nt|djneill: some might open South's hand 2@c based on the large number of tricks, right?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes I think the S hand should use whatever forcing opening they use, I would open 2@C|pg||
nt|djneill: 2@c being a strong ART bid, for any poles|pg||
nt|anton72: nice spot ...120|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Simonsen needed a small break after the last one to reboot so we start again.|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|andyv:  looks like it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The 4th seat defender usually gets two opportunities to bid.|pg||
nt|andersk: Maybe they dont play 2 NT as unbalanced GF|pg||
nt|rv: anyone for transfers on 1m-1n?|pg||
nt|james_h: I prefer 2n to 2@h|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sharkey: Our excellent operator, Torstein Hesseberg, informs me the club is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year - also followed by a big tournement this fall|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not shure there|pg||
nt|larsarthur: 1 or 2 imp back to vikersund|pg||
nt|djneill: North, having passed, has 4 card support, a working @hQ, and a side doubleton - yeah I think 5@d is an underbid :-)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|h_karluk: The defence do not know opener's hand type immediately. |pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems so now. When 3@H came|pg||
nt|andyv:  looking for 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 2 nt 3 cl 3h should be alerted|pg||
nt|h_karluk: So does that make defending against the multi 2? easier or more difficult than against a weak two? In my opinion there's no problem  as long as you are sensible about it. ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Basically, assume that the 2D opener has a weak 2H/S hand. |pg||
nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx Torstein:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: :-)|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would expect most to double.  Meanwhile, this seems somewhat meek.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|h_karluk: There are numerous variations of the multi 2D, so let's assume a fairly basic one (weak major; strong minor or strong balanced). The suggested defence does not really change if ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there are other possibilities such as 4441 distributions  assume a weak opener. |pg||
nt|andyv:  like all systems...after a while a decent defense or multiple defenses are found and then we wait for the newest development.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: this is my laste Geir will now join |pg||
nt|lestergold: well both n/s stretching their values here |pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: bye all see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|rv: if Ringseth's had a stiff major, he could have jumped to 3M to show stiff and long @DS|pg||
nt|rv: unfortunately 3@c on 1@d-1n shows both minors and 18+hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: I hate  2 @c on unbalanced,  (tough to describe) hard to catch up |pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: ht lead looks likely and no play|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as OR misplayed this board. They lost two tricks in @S + 3@Hs|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|h_karluk: 4th seat  Assuming RHO bids a weak 2d |pg||
nt|andyv:  nice acution|pg||
nt|jaheim: and a coffeebreak|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andyv:  auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: bye Torstien|pg||
pc|hK|nt|h_karluk: Now things are different, LHO and RHO are both weak|pg||
nt|sybarra: that 9 of @S in dummy is a big card |pg||
nt|james_h: another find the lady hand|pg||
nt|rv: in any case it is best to play some science, either transfers or artificial 2n response as suggested by Anders|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you can freely bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: as is the club holding |pg||
nt|andyv:  but will be difficult to find Q@d unless following the Crane rule:)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: and crane rule is?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: Well done Torstein and welcome to Geir as the new vug operator. See u tomorrow.|pg||
nt|lestergold: both final bids were overbids in my book|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was it?|pg||

nt|andersk: red card:)|pg||
nt|andersk: @H 4|pg||
nt|djneill: well 1@h certainly worked out here, but had East passed it would not have - the idea is that a void ensures you will not play it at the 1-level|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a lot depends on how bad N can be for for 2S and--especially--whether NS have multiple ways to raise to 2S. if they do and N has already shown dreck, then he could be turned on by ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the 3H bid...although with 11 losers and bad trumps it is still hard to bid 4S. if they dont have 2 ways to raise to 2S, N can hardly bid a game even though he has heart values|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@S by 10HP and 10X by often 6@Ss in S seems OK at me.|pg||
nt|rv: in case Flatt is just dropping off:)|pg||
nt|andersk: yep:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  when the 5 card suit is @ss and you only have 2@h, it seems like 1@s is more efficient....if the 5 card suit is @H, then the advantage of 1N is a preemptive bid against @ss.|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: wow grand!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Atthe OR W didn't bid so then 2@S was a normal bid.|pg||
nt|djneill: in the other room, North played a low @c from the Ace, getting a @c trick before the ruffing began|pg||

nt|djneill: East might pass this|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3NT at OR and a @C lead|pg||

nt|h_karluk: looking into future is not a bad thing, however i am expected to tell partner what i have in my hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bad hand for forcing NT, one of many reasons why so many top players no longer play it, whereas not that long ago it was the norm|pg||
nt|rodal f: Inv minor 10HP+ at 2@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@h??|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Was told that NS was in the final in 2000 and 2004, so there 3rd one now.|pg||
nt|lestergold: south needs to try and take up max space here|pg||
nt|lestergold: feeble|pg||
nt|jaheim: pass?, strange bid  |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Trouble if Skjetne puts up th @CQ|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|rodal f: Would be the nice bid Mike:) Exlution to many pairs use to forget.|pg||
nt|lestergold: south shopul;d have donned brown corduroy trousers and barraged big time|pg||
nt|djneill: West has 9 HCP and a source of tricks vulnerable opposite 15-17, I hope West thinks this is forcing, and also hope East does|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rodal f: I didn't exspect the Q there. Had time to wait:(|pg||
nt|sharkey: Afraid of @S shift|pg||
nt|sharkey: This hand plays better Double Dummy - Skjetne's play not unreasonable |pg||
nt|sybarra: I will correct my statement, I actually would open 1 nt,  (for some reason I though he had 6 sp, hence the not my pattern)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah playing forcing NT they would get to 2@S.|pg||

pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: 2S might well make, i was thinking of 3C|pg||
nt|hagz: OR 7 @c|pg||
nt|djneill: ok only way this goes down is if West ruffs high on the 3rd @c, but the @s6 then !7 is not from shortness - did South show 4@s specifically I wonder|pg||
nt|djneill: 3rd @s sorry|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: forgive the expression but being a money player ui dont like paying out to vul grannies|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well i dont fully understand bidding system, but was this that difficuklt a grand to reach|pg||
nt|rodal f: As Mike said.          The bid from W was 5@H over 3@H.|pg||
nt|lestergold: nol i said that south should have bid 5@h to take up space but having only bid 3@h west needed 5@h as unambiguous void showing and grand slam try|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|djneill: important to inquire about agreements, at least above the club level (then it just helps them )|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jcwla: That's not happening -- at least not as a result of forcing NT.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, non-forcing NT would be a lovely idea if 1NT meant "I have a nice balanced minimum responding hand."|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  undertrick time|pg||
nt|jcwla: Unfortunately, much of the time it means "I have some shapely hand that doesn't have enough strength to bid at the 2 level."|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bidding small only wsas very expensive i think specs would mostly understand that as meaning the only thing it coluld mean|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: yes it is fairly normal to bid 2S despite the poor holding and the good clubs--my point is that playing forcing NT really S has no idea of which black suit will be best|pg||
nt|rodal f: It's exslution blackwood. HOW many aces do u have pard exsept in @H|pg||
pc|hT|nt|djneill: South pitched a low @c, probably encouragement|pg||
mc|8|nt|lestergold: what was that 12 imps or so|pg||
nt|lestergold: and e/w cannot afford yhis sort of loss|pg||

nt|djneill: either way, East should present a @h Jack or Ten, to induce a cover, even if really finessing the other way|pg||
nt|djneill: for instance, if East was on the board now, East could play the @hJ - planning on overtaking and hooking the other way|pg||
nt|djneill: North has no idea that East has the @hT so might just cover|pg||
nt|djneill: that extra chance takes you from 50% to maybe 70%, but here there are other clues to where the long @h are|pg||
nt|djneill: South doubled 1@h for takeout, so presumably has 8 @s and @d cards|pg||

nt|vugraphzkn: Back to 15 now and last now.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  What was Souths Double?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 1C I thought was strong club?|pg||
nt|jaheim: mm,  i dont think that NS are looking forward to the half time comparasing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah I am told 1@C is a transfer to @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Something wrong with the cards. They know the hands. Getting TD to check now. Going to 16 first.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  My advice: Tell teammates, that "we were sitting wrong as E/W"...|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A spec came wit 3@S from S as a good raise then 4 might would have becomed a small slam try?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: THX also to the co comentators for all there nice and vice inputs for the specs and co comentators:) See u later.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|h_karluk: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: thx all |pg||
nt|sybarra: and the X is?  "cards"  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3 in a row 4@s|pg||
nt|jcwla: Evjen failed in 3NT on 13 in the OR - so the rout is on.|pg||
nt|sybarra: well that overcall keeps n/s out of their ht "fit" |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: On Bd 14 S Dbl OR but failed to bid 4@S over 4@Hso looks like a push|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be Shirley|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 5T contrat desire|pg||
nt|james_h: but 6d maked|pg||
nt|james_h: makes|pg||
nt|rv: interesting defensive problem here|pg||
nt|djneill: lol|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Surely does|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rodal f: They are playing with screens so the thinking don't matter that much as at open tables.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|djneill: well, kind of :-)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sharkey: Hartvigsen's 3@C VUL not for the faint hearted....|pg||
nt|jcwla: A light passed-hand double by W - usually a good idea.|pg||
nt|djneill: N-S are playing in @h anyways, for 50 a pop|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Who know Shirley?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: I understand Remvik's 4@C. Hartvigsen should have been a bit stronger for his 3@C bid.|pg||
nt|hagz: 5 @c makes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with only one ace, i think 3N is very dubious. 3H better then if S bids 3N fine|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: we can see North has opened 1@d instead of 1@h, with the same 4432 shape|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rodal f: Neg use to be normal.|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty all...wonderful show put on by all... and ty specs for your comments and help|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S snatches defeat from the jaws of victory - again|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But E gets in on the act|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2 times @H and @C give a pitch in @D at E and slam are on.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mcarroll: and S again - again|pg||
nt|rv: North should duck first and second @hs to set this contract|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sharkey: One of those hand that plays well if pd just have trumps...|pg||
nt|sharkey: @D lead wud have ensured defeat|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|djneill: so East can play this as if he is defending @h |pg||
nt|djneill: unfortunately, there is no @s finesse when N-S can see West's hand|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|rv: now he should hop with @sA and cash out|pg||
nt|rv: not easy at all|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcwla: And Smith failed in 3NT on 14 -- so the lead plumps to 40.  Welcome to all who've joined us from the OR.|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|djneill: 4@s was reached in the other room, and the 500 did score a few imps for E-W|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|larsarthur: flat board here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N could bid 3D too, but 3H sends more of a message that N is worried about spades|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
nt|djneill: if I was N-S and I knew about the 5-0 @h break, I would do anything but bleed all the trumps|pg||
nt|djneill: so defenders here should do likewise|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sharkey: @C lead works as well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 9 hcp, no trump support, perhaps 3C wld be mistaken, so easy X in competition|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andyv:  good session for BK Grand which was able to stretch out it's lead|pg||
nt|james_h: right, the club situation not clear for N|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|james_h: up to that point|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mcarroll: a double would have led to a 71-0 score|pg||
nt|rv: these small contracts of playing and defending 1n just don't get adequate rewards in IMPs scoring|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|rodal f: Trick one will cost many tricks now:(|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Probably makes no difference to the final result|pg||
nt|jaheim: mm   only 8 ims now, and 67- 0|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jaheim: imps|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|rodal f: Tomorrow at 10.00CET the start will be Namsos agains Førde. Welcomed u all are:)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sharkey: off 2 I think|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|hagz: 3 more imps to singsås|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|rv: they are much tougher and aesthetically more pleasing especially for parntership angle than games and slams|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pg||

nt|h_karluk: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php |pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like there should be a slam someplace here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: kibitzers proudly welcomed|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But it was strong earlier in the round?|pg||
nt|rv: this is last deal of this round|pg||
nt|rv: thanks to excellent Vu graph operator Geir, my excellent co-commentators James and Anders|pg||
nt|james_h: Thx RV and Geo, pleasure to talk round the edges of your analysis :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Next session will start 14:45 local time|pg||
nt|mcarroll: a tough flat board|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: I had the Students as one by two favorits, but the fieald is wide open this year.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are Petter having a problem to use the finger counting HP?:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder how they only made 5N in OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  seeing a lot of red:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not much surprise easy 11 tricks|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Anyway - new board|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  in 6 have to take the @s hook|pg||
nt|jcwla: As we reach the last board of this segment, a big thank you to our excellent operator, Geir Harnes.  Big thanks also to the NBF and BK Grand (Petter Haram, Terje Lie).  Big thanks ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: to Roland Wald, the tireless coordinator of BBO vugraph presentations.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  NOT making 1 NT seems rather difficult, losing 4 @h, 1 @C and 1@S|pg||
nt|jaheim:   1 NTstill 10 -13   |pg||
nt|djneill: thanks martin and shirley|pg||

nt|james_h: and Anders|pg||
nt|mcarroll: tx all|pg||
mb|5D|nt|sharkey: Will EW let opps play in 5@D Dbl?|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  club leads probably preclude taking any hooks in 3N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @s hook works, no transportartion problems, flat board|pg||
nt|djneill: we could see another 5crd fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to our terrific operator, Gier |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: and mighty @d ten :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  aren't there 12 tricks?|pg||
nt|andyv:  or am I missing something?|pg||
nt|andyv:  in NT|pg||
nt|jcwla: Finally, big thanks to my fellow commentators for their excellent insights: Lars Arthur Johansen and Marshall Lewis, and of course thanks to all specs.|pg||
nt|djneill: North should pass - short @h implies E-W are missing a @h fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: @dA+ruff?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: XX = 3S|pg||
nt|sybarra: and of course thx to our specs, with all the commdents we appreciate them |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: East's Pass is forcing - what's West to do?|pg||

nt|vugraphzkn: :)|pg||
nt|james_h: nice invention there|pg||
nt|rv: Forde needs to reduce margin by atleast 7 IMPs to get 1 VP:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: The Norwegian Broadcasting Corp has mad a piece on this event: http://nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/more_og_romsdal/1.7124388|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
nt|rv: also special thanks to Roland and BBO team for broadcasting such good tournies from all round the world and finally to all spectators for listening to us patiently|pg||

nt|sybarra: right,  just cash |pg||
nt|rodal f: Thanks also to the fellow comentators wich have made it a bit more easy for all of us. Specs as commentators as vug operators:) Well done.|pg||
nt|djneill: it may come down to the @c guess|pg||
nt|djneill: but there are endplay possibilities in @s too - @s and another means South will win and possibly give a ruff-sluff|pg||
nt|djneill: as North did not lead the @sK, there is small hint that South has doubleton honor|pg||
nt|djneill: @sQ here may solve it|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rodal f: Got that because of his wild biddings when ma - pa - Tora(sister) and Torstein played privat.|pg||

nt|rodal f: No hook for shure. Its team and not match:)|pg||
