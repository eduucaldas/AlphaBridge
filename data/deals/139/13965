mb|2S|nt|iain sime: Hi Tony. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lilac9: eleven tricks look easy for east|pg||
nt|lilac9: giving two minor suit aces only|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: well trouble for Steel now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@d showing @h i guess|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pitiful:  a method that is becoming more popular|pg||

pc|c6|nt|idc: ah, that makes sense then |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so sound bidding to 3NT this hand..|pg||
nt|iain sime: On a heart lead this makes six clubs and three aces. |pg||
nt|patricck: But why would you lead a heart on this auction?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Going back to totally old fashioned methods then 2@S is best --after all it is not a race |pg||
pc|s4|nt|patricck: OK, so what would I know :) |pg||
pc|s2|nt|wilkinsona: why not, seems a good bet|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|garnetts: On this hand I would rather chew my own arm off than bid opposite a passed partner|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: here, having seen Clive's 2 heart bid on an earlier hand, perhaps 3 spades a pushy bid|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|lilac9: and club queen of course|pg||
nt|iain sime: No attractive alternative.|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|lark20: especially with such a flat hand|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but once again partnership understandings are vital..|pg||
nt|garnetts: a trump lead anyone?  |pg||

pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|h4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well John Holland moved, but perhaps he is more sure of the 2 heart bid|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|galadriel: Yes, it was a club lead|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|h5|pc|s9|pg||

nt|galadriel: Match even closer now|pg||
nt|mr murray: Hi everyone|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lilac9: four hearts is not a piece of cake |pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: Yes, a @D was led at the other table. Once in a while East will bid 3NT without a diamond stop and you pay off. |pg||
nt|garnetts: 1NT to protect maybe |pg||
nt|patricck: a little too thin for me|pg||
nt|lark20: esp vul|pg||
nt|garnetts: well can hardly have much more if you have passed |pg||
nt|garnetts: partner could have somewhat more than they have |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes but 1 diamond may not be the best EW contract|pg||
nt|patricck: you might have some 10s and 9s and have some honours in your 4 card suit tho|pg||
nt|mr murray: seems like a pretty quiet 4 heart contract. |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk1: The team names are reversed on the scoreboard I'm afraid. No way we can change that now, has to wait until the second stanza. Iain, could you keep track, please?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: if you reopen and oppo bid & make 4 hearts, not so good|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree about 1@D not being the best contract when maybe partner has 4/5 and is fixed--but then you might miss a game |pg||
nt|idc: 1@c is 2 way, weak or strong club values|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzgu: so now 11-13 balanced|pg||
nt|idc: 1@d  0-11 and 1@s showed the 11-13 weak option|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|mr murray: good time for a coffee break.|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|iain sime: ok.|pg||
nt|Walddk1: ty|pg||
pc|s6|nt|garnetts: Most easts these days would bid on junk anyway |pg||
pc|sA|nt|lilac9: and east gets to play|pg||
nt|lilac9: interesting|pg||
nt|galadriel: This could go down|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Holland seemed to make that 4 hearts by ruffing his 4th diamond in dummy, so maybe it can go down...|pg||
nt|galadriel: You just got here and now you are taking a break?? :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jcwla: S will have to do some good guessing here after W ducks the @SJ return.|pg||
nt|idc: These Polish @c style 2-way club systems quite popular now, but the Outreds have a mostly home-grown version|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 12 trick possible now..|pg||
pc|c3|nt|galadriel: W must duck this @S|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|galadriel: Now dificult to get this right for declarer|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: same auction in both rooms...|pg||
nt|galadriel: he will probably play for the drop|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jcwla: W has the @S length so needs some reason to put W on @C length also.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: further he got good breaks in 2 side suits to do it so maybe its not so good a contract|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|iain sime: Clive ran the heart to his jack trusting Les Steel to have led an honest card- can be a dangerous course as many of us have found to our cost over the years.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and some players open 1 d with a strong distribtional hand thinking "this will not be passed out"|pg||
nt|garnetts: You have a better case over 1@C |pg||
nt|idc: keeps us commentators on our toes when we have to consult documentation for every bid :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|wilkinsona: nobody looking to play in clubs|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcwla: Now on to @H's and it has become easier.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||

pc|cT|pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|garnetts: besides which if I pay entry fees I like to live a little :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jcwla: The @H9 -- is it perhaps too cute by half?|pg||
nt|idc: This contract is in no danger but every overtrick could be vital in what is now in effect an 8 board final|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|galadriel: I think it's very interesting whether you can make short suit or long suit tries after major raises - it's good to be able to do both|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|nt|lilac9: neat play |pg||
pc|hK|nt|wilkinsona: so the lead to Outred|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
mc|9|nt|idc: 2 overtricks possible i think if East takes 2 @s and puts pressure on SOuth|pg||
nt|idc: So that is the first half of this extra-time set of 8|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: spec suggests there was a 1 diamond opening|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|iain sime: Club lead seems normal. Declarer then tries to drive out the hearts.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: in fact declarer will do very well to make this...|pg||
nt|patricck: EW will need to be spot on to beat this|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: by south|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: yes - sry|pg||
nt|pitiful:  would you have passed as north paul?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|garnetts: after this start South bid 3@D next door--but I think 3NT is more practical even if it goes off |pg||
nt|lark20: good lead for declarer|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|wilkinsona: perhaps the heart 10 is the best try...|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Imprtant for the Steel team that this goes down|pg||
nt|mr murray: lead sinks it. Not that there was much of a chance with any lead|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|nt|mr murray: 4-1 trumps too much to handle with so few entries to East|pg||
pc|d4|nt|patricck: East has to have the diamonds to cash when in with the Q@H, otherwise declarer will prevail|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pc|s7|nt|iain sime: Needs a spade switch now.|pg||

pc|d8|nt|patricck: yes, on a diamond switch the 9@H from declarer wins|pg||

pc|c7|nt|wilkinsona: a fair try by south I think|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: difficult hand|pg||
nt|jcwla: Shame to see that opening get rewarded but there it is.|pg||
nt|galadriel: I was thinking that opening made it easier to play W for @C A|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: when you have been playing an event for about 7/8 months... and it may come to the last imp..|pg||
nt|idc: I'm obviously finding the extra 8 boards tough too - I didn't notice that on Bd 7, the potential N-S 4@h,|pg||
nt|idc: the defence can beat 4@h by leading spades & getting a trump promotion|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|mr murray: normal spade lead sinks 3n/t|pg||
nt|galadriel: Looks as though this should make with @S 4-4|pg||

mb|1N|nt|iain sime: Good result for East West in the other room.|pg||
nt|garnetts: West has a problem over the opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: certainly is..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: a better opening bid by south here..|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|garnetts: pass is perhaps best--might consider 1NT but I hate 2@D |pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|iain sime: South opened 3@D- doubled and floated.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: a lucky 3N it seems|pg||
nt|galadriel: So, the Outred team charging ahead now|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: 5 tricks if the defence cash|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: well...5 tricks to take|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and more imps here it seems|pg||

nt|jcwla: @D honor lead might suggest @CJ in W.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lark20: Thanks, sorry Roland|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: o yes, |pg||
nt|garnetts: South can almost count the tricks |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well I will congratulate Biff in advance if he finds this|pg||
nt|lark20: "McGeorge"  Tony|pg||
nt|garnetts: He will be expecting six @Ds and how likely is it that partner has the A@C |pg||
pc|c7|nt|idc: a little suprised that North didn't transfer to 3@d the first time, but he has done the right thing next round|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mr murray: sorry miscounted|pg||
nt|mr murray: nothing beats it|pg||
nt|galadriel: Don't you win the @S and play a @H for your 9th?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mr murray: yes of course|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: diamond lead give defence 2 trumps it seems|pg||
nt|patricck: I like the 3@D opening on the South hand. This result is a little unlucky, on a lot of other boards it will give EW a difficult problem. it is perhaps questionable at this ...|pg||
nt|patricck: vulnerability, but I still wouldn't crime the action|pg||

nt|paulg:  an awkward problem for North|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: In other room Vi was perhaps influenced by her system, in which 1d shows either minor I believe|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looking at all 4 hands, seems if he was to play a spade might as well been the ace I suppose|pg||
nt|garnetts: nasty hand for NS |pg||
nt|jcwla: Everything coming up roses for Outred, until...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: lively hand|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may well have viewed that a 44 break was less odds than the hook|pg||
nt|galadriel: lead changes hands again|pg||
nt|galadriel: very exciting!|pg||

nt|idc: Board 7 result in - Owen-Holland got to 4@h as expected and defence found trump promotion for 7 IMPs to Steel|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|d|nt|galadriel: Interesting that Steel passed initially but was prepared to enter the auction at the 5 level|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well the overcall rather than x makes a difference|pg||
nt|galadriel: John Holland led the 3 which must be from a 4 carder if they play 4th and he is NOT false carding|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|nt|galadriel: Oh ye..the E hand isn't nearly as good now|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: EW vul so will not get really busy |pg||

nt|lark20: 4 spades seems such alikely contract, but what a break|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well the actions by both sides look reasonable but nearly a 2000 swing|pg||

pc|h7|nt|jcwla: I'm sorry - it might be wrong but I'm not passing quietly the second time with the E hand.|pg||
nt|galadriel: Well, it's a bit unusual for Steel and Walker to be so much more aggressive than the \outreds I think|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

nt|idc: given the circumstances, I'd be playing a lot more slowly than this lot are|pg||
nt|idc: ok, another 2 boards coming up - I expect the tables will need to close & be reopened|pg||
nt|paulg:  Do you think they swap opponents after one board?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: i fear we have no more predealt boards but we'll keep the room open and let u know what's happening|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: no - no swapping :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: just 2 board set(s)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: we have Sanders/McGeorge vs Outreds|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: in the closed|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: dealing boards at the table|pg||
nt|paulg:  Aside from the number of kibitzers, this is very similar to when we all waiting for the result of an appeal in the Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|paulg:  there were 3000 kibitzers waiting then, but I guess there were fewer vugraph tables open and still playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: Board 2 here first...|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: 1NT by east - P - P - 2D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: P - 2H - 3D - P|pg||
nt|idc: I guess the computer doesn't have these extra boards specs, so we cannot show you them|pg||
nt|idc: no one expected 2 ties|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: no...looks like 3@D going to go 1 off|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm guessing 2@d showed a major|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: perhaps 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: 2@D was spades and another|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: perhaps the moral is not to play in the oppos other suit :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  Are the Outreds sitting E/W and they went down?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: yes|pg||
nt|paulg:  it's like I'm almost there|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: not finished yet - but looking like -100 (at green)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: mmm....are you sure|pg||
nt|idc: For those specs just joining: we have had a tie after 64 boards, another tie after extra 8, and now playing 2 more boards|pg||
nt|idc: but we don't have those 2 on the computers, so we will just report the results to you|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: yes -100 here|pg||
nt|paulg:  this must be triple overtime for us though?|pg||
nt|paulg:  I'll mark it clearly on the timesheet for Roland|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: ok - board 1 now|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: EW made 3 spades in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: looks like the auction here is heading to the same spot...|pg||
nt|paulg:  although it's hard to tell, not having sight of the boards and all, nine tricks in spades is rarely a poor score|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: W has a 5143 2 count opposite a 2NT opener|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: so 3@S by East|pg||
nt|idc: Actually, this is perfect for my commentary style - I usually analyse as though I can't see the cards|pg||
nt|paulg:  fits my play more|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: this looks like it might be drifting 1 off here tho'|pg||
nt|idc: who is E-W now Stephen?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: still Outreds|pg||
nt|idc: So if it does go -1 here, that will be medium swing to Steel|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: so 1 off and 5 to Steel|pg||
nt|paulg:  Thanks to Stephen Peterkin for providing us with live commentary from Edinburgh|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: but looks like still atie|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: Steel losing 300 on board 1 for 5 imps out|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: ok - 2 more|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: the players getting a little frazzled...|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: new boards up: board 4 here looks as if |pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: Sorry - McGeorge (South) playing 3NT after Owen (West) opened a Lucas 2@S|pg||
nt|paulg:  I think both these teams are lacking the essential training needed for this|pg||
nt|paulg:  I've never seen them playing in the Peebles 2-board teams knockout competition|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: Quite so - they have not read the book|pg||
nt|paulg:  it is meant to be a fun event, but my partner gave me 15 pages of notes to learn|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: The rules for splitting ties say that they continue to play 2-board rounds till we have a winner|pg||
nt|paulg:  to be fair, these are two teams where a close result might be expected, but you would not expect flat boards|pg||
nt|paulg:  is McGeorge playing slowly?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: so 3NT going 1off...+100 to Outred|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: Curious auction...|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: NS bid 1@S - 2@C|pg||
nt|paulg:  so board 3 is reported as 4@s-1 by Outred (South) at the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: 4@H (shortage) - 4S all pass|pg||
nt|paulg:  they are playing point-a-board now|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: this also looking like 1 off|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: big tank - playing xxx opposite KJx but no winning option...|pg||
nt|paulg:  on bd 4, it is the same 3NT but played the other way round|pg||
nt|paulg:  it is hard to tell if that makes a significant difference|pg||
nt|paulg:  I've got both tables up now, so I can see nothing in stereo|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: that's it over - 3NT 2 off at other table on board 4 - so Steel wins by 3 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: thnx all for waiting|pg||
nt|paulg:  Many thanks Stephen, don't let the Steel team trample you in the rush to the bar!|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: i'll hold my own i think :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: thnx all and off to pub now :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzgt: another tie. we have no pre-prepared boards for 2 sets...I will give a commentary if you like|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: lineup for this board is the same as shown|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: manually dealt board. Holland passes and steel opens 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: walker transfers to spades and then passes. Steel declarer in 3S|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: steel is thinking longing for the pub...|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: he makes 9 tricks...for +140|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: board 2 arrives of extra extra time...|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: steel non vul v vul opens 1@C Owen overcalls 1@H Walker thinks...|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: walker bids 3C|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: Holland bids 4@H with a flourish and steel ponders then essays 5@c doubled and passed out|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: steel goes down two|pg||
nt|idc: Thanks Dee - do we have a score for that board yet (or either of them)?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: first shout is that they were very swingy and we still have a tie!|pg||
nt|idc: For those specs who have just joined - we have had ties after 64 boards, and again after 8 extra, now playing 2 more|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: on board 2 EW played in 3D -2 and lost 100. 5 imps to Outred, the other board was 5 imps to steel|pg||
nt|idc: but the BBO computers do not have the deals, so we are just waiting|pg||
nt|idc: and now a further tie (!) so they will play 2 *more* boards, and keep doing that until we get a result|pg||
nt|idc: our apologies for the lack of boards, but no one anticipated the players being so useless as not to be able to win (or lose)!|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: They are now dealing boards 3 and 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: well three in this room - 4 in the other|pg||
nt|idc: or as Fraser Morgan suggests, perhaps they are just evenly highly skilled :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: 1@S from S pass from walker 2@C (Alerted) from North and pass from E|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: 3@H from S (alerted) and pass from |pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: 3@S N 4@C S 4S North. Final contract 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: by South|pg||
nt|idc: If it is still Outreds, 2@c is 12+ artificial, and 3@h .. isn't in notes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: yes - Cahrles and Vi it is|pg||
nt|idc: Oh, it is - natural but a 5 card suit, so I guess 5-5+ in majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: Charles ...sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: no. she has singleton @H|pg||
nt|idc: To keep us occupied specs - you should now be able to predict the North-South hands - Roland will award prizes|pg||
nt|idc: an extra chocolate bunny to anyone who gives the defenders hands too|pg||
nt|friggi: yeeeeeeee tell me the other joke you know:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: dummy is Ky Qxx KJxx QJxx|pg||
nt|idc: Thanks for info Dee - the CC & Notes I'm using are from 2007, so I guess they have changed that bit|pg||
nt|idc: Rehi Fridrik|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: 4@S was one down.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: Les says 3NT makes but not a nice contract|pg||
nt|idc: Thanks - 4@s -1 by Outred in this room on that Bd|pg||
nt|idc: This is a bit like bridge on the radio must have been in the 1930s & 1940s|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: here is board 4. G/A dealer W|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: W-pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: N-1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: E-Pass|pg||
nt|friggi: the problem was between 1940-1945|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: S-KJ9 10xx  AKxxxx  x|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: s-3@C (alerted) xfer to 3d - compulsory|pg||
nt|idc: We have a report that this Bd, (4) was 3NT -1 by McGeorge in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: W - pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: N- 3D |pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: e-pASS|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: S-3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: passed out|pg||
nt|friggi: 5@D my guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: in the other room this went one off.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: played from the other hand though|pg||
nt|friggi: this one will make|pg||
nt|idc: Report from other room that it is looking like a flat board on Bd 3|pg||
nt|idc: In other words, it looks to be heading one down|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: you may think so but N won the lead and played the 9@D (curse) Steel played the @Dj and dummy ducked....walker then showed out|pg||
nt|idc: if so, we must hope that 3NT doesn't go -1 here, or we will be off again for 2 more|pg||
nt|friggi: just play @H and all problems are over:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: it was a @C lead btw...|pg||
nt|friggi: ok|pg||
nt|idc: I think Fridrik is being a little under 100% serious :)|pg||
nt|friggi: 99% i sthat close enough?|pg||
nt|friggi: that|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: we are deep in thought on trick 4...|pg||
nt|friggi: taking AK of @H and tr on 8 would transfer teh problem, that was my comment Ian:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: otat least 2 off|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: it was 2 off|pg||
nt|idc: I have to take my hat off to specs: to sit and wait and suffer commentators blethering just because of love of the game|pg||
nt|friggi: ditto|pg||
nt|idc: IIRC, that was Outreds -2 in 3NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: A win for Steel by 3 imps...!|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: Les inviting everyoe for a drink in the pub...!|pg||
nt|idc: ok specs - obviously we are just calling this tentatively for now (just the early exit poll)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgt: confirmed as a steel win....|pg||
nt|friggi: that is very nice of him:)|pg||
nt|idc: but it looks like Bd 4 flat in 4@s -1, and 3NT -1 by McGeorge but -2 by Outred|pg||
nt|idc: so Steel has won the Scottish Cup 2010 by 3 IMPs|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: so well done|pg||
nt|idc: So Bd 7 is a potential gain for Outred team|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|patricck: One of those hands where 7@S can be made but 7@H cannot|pg||
nt|iain sime: Good slam here- well reached by Bif McGeorge and Derek Sanders in the other room. Maybe make 7@S though.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not a pleasant contract for John Holland in OR|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|garnetts: they did well to stop in 5@D next door |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: in the other room declarer played safe for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|patricck: slam can make|pg||
nt|galadriel: At least nobody doubled it|pg||
nt|idc: 1@c is 2 way, min opening or a strong club type hand|pg||
nt|idc: 1@d 0-11|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|idc: So McGeorge's dbl covers a wider range of points & shape than usual|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: 7@S needs a 3-2 trump bereak, and just that alone makes it a marginal proposition for a grand slam|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Im surprised at the 4 heart bid..|pg||
nt|iain sime: Not sure of the Eat West methods but most play 4@H is a minimum.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well it sure is not..|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: 2NT promosed a raise to 3@H only|pg||
nt|iain sime: If so, West has an ace extra.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lark20: Surprised McGeorge didn't attempt to show his 5 card heart suit|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, 2@D looked odd|pg||
nt|idc: For those of you who have just joined us - the final of 64 boards was actually tied|pg||
nt|idc: and not a win for Outred by 7 as we thought|pg||
nt|idc: so we are playing an extra set of 8 boards|pg||
pc|d4|nt|galadriel: I guess XX showed @C|pg||
pc|d6|nt|wilkinsona: carefule play needed|pg||
nt|galadriel: I wonder if an initial 2@H would be NF?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: nobody x this either|pg||
nt|mr murray: feels like same down 2.|pg||
nt|mr murray: push board|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: XX showed hearts|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|garnetts: this can only make if dec leaves the J@D in dummy to ruff a club --needs to use the heart entry  |pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|galadriel: Ah thx Stephen|pg||
pc|dA|nt|wilkinsona: perhaps 1N enough with the bullets flying|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d5|nt|wilkinsona: reliable spec says 3 hearts is min for this pair|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
nt|garnetts: well done |pg||
nt|idc: South here has typically a weak NT hand for the dbl|pg||
nt|idc: or at least, North should play him for no more than that - I think North should try 2@d over 2@c|pg||
nt|idc: but he liked his club suit for defence, so it wasn't an automatic 2@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: should South not try 2 or even 3 diamonds...|pg||
pc|dK|pc|hJ|pc|d8|pc|c8|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wilkinsona: spades now for a -1 escape|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|idc: true I guess, North did pass the 1@d dbl|pg||
pc|h7|nt|iain sime: If 2NT is not game forcing, but can still be this strong, West ought to do something en route.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|wilkinsona: Iain, would you respond 1 spade?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lark20: well done|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|iain sime: No. I would always support with four.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thats well played by Sanders|pg||
nt|idc: they will make game in @d, though probably never reach it|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|c6|pc|h8|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|idc: but letting 2@c make when it was going down is bad too|pg||
