nt|jaapfr: are EW female students:)?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Also part of the explanation why when it's not clear who owns the hand or who can make what, the 5 level belongs to the opponents.|pg||
nt|lestergold: why do i call you Frank it should be Rodal its psychological sorry|pg||
nt|jaheim: strange 6 sp with only K8xx in @S|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Lea Seestelä|pg||
nt|maribelxx: Hello all!|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: another @S contract,  better trumph this time  :)|pg||
nt|stoffers: instead of 2nt eliassen could have bid 4@h maybe?'|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4 @H/@S EW same losers.|pg||
nt|jaheim: How many @d will Bremset bid?|pg||
nt|jaheim: 3 or 4?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rodal f: Or a auto stop at 2@H?|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h should make |pg||
nt|rodal f: Looks as Ekrens 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: it is |pg||
nt|jaheim: but 9 tricks max|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - 8 to be exact - both ways|pg||
mb|d|nt|sharkey: A rarity - a weak 2@D opener|pg||
nt|sharkey: the previous board was down 2 - not 1 - will be corrected|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to find A@c and Q@c lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: good vuln save|pg||
nt|andyv:  down at least 500|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx Torstein:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes they may stretch too far on this one too|pg||
nt|djneill: how many @s now, shirley?|pg||
nt|djneill: 2@s, 3@s seem the options|pg||
nt|stoffers: vulnerable thats a big 2@s i think...but when finding partner with a 6 card fit...no problem|pg||
nt|jaheim: chicken|pg||
nt|jaheim: :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rodal f: This contract is playable by a dobble hook in @C|pg||
nt|hagz: 3 NT makes, 6 @c makes|pg||
nt|maribelxx: So we are at Ålesund now...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: looks reasonable - unless the 4-1 @H break becomes a problem|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here is a good example of a hand that natural bidders should open 1@D.|pg||
nt|larsarthur: south is not sure about @dfit|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Marshall Lewis|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hi all :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Must be prepared for all continuations -- here, 1@D and then 3@C and you feel much better than this.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@c seems a better contract ironically|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Vul cannot take a chance.|pg||
nt|jaheim: 1@s shows 4@s and 4+@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  now it's serious:)|pg||
nt|larsarthur: lowest 4-card is std in Norway|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Marshalll.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A spec asked why Harstad havn't been at BBO. They try to do there best and match 7 are not putted up. They told.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now 5@H+4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|hagz: Hard to guess @s in 3 NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Just one thing left to do! Bid the 6er....|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually isnt 3n a trick short on a heart lead?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sharkey: A @D lead appears to be best for defence|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S had only 4 losers imo|pg||
nt|jcwla: Interesting to know but that doesn't begin and end the conversation for me in terms of how best to describe this hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Anders Kristensen and GeO Tislevoll (partly)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk5: Running scores at  http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1074140R|pg||
nt|djneill: thanks Geir Harnes, who says East is a cousin of Geir Helgemo|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wander what's gona happen in OR at this? |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: there are arguments on both sides, but you aren;lt getting full value for money out of sputnik if you follow the same sequence with this S hand and also on   xx  AKx   xx  Axxxxx|pg||
nt|james_h: tricky rebid in normal systems for south, no such difficulty here 1@s must be 5?|pg||
nt|rv: 1@s possibly shows 5@s here|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi folks!|pg||
nt|geot: Hi friends:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 1 spade was not forcing|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Andres, wlc|pg||
nt|james_h: Hi Geo|pg||
nt|djneill: 3@s shows an unbalanced hand typically, but occasionally 4522 - East has a sharp hand, so at IMPs the idea is to just bid game and hope to make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice name to have going into competition |pg||
nt|djneill: yep|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|andyv:  on @s lead, can N still hold it down to only 4 losers?|pg||
nt|andyv:  without dbl dummying the @c suit?|pg||
nt|james_h: Hi Anders|pg||
nt|maribelxx: Partner doubled top show spades|pg||
nt|maribelxx: Better to keep him happy and lead his suit :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome back Frank|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rodal f: If any want to look at the pairs systemcards u find them here: http://www.nmlag.com/Systemkort til the turney is fin|pg||
nt|jcwla: When the clubs are significantly stronger or you will be able to handle all continuations, I have no problem with 1@C.  Here, a rebid problem such as this was reasonably likely.|pg||
nt|hagz: yeah, there is only one entrance the the dummy to get the @s tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This might have - regarding the bidding - about 7Â½ % chance to make|pg||
nt|rnmalik: but for 8@H this hand has all the possibilities of making 6:)|pg||
nt|maribelxx: As for declarer where would the 7th trick come from?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: i suppose 2d sgowing i assume 4 spades might pick them|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant be done really |pg||
nt|hagz: Can't get them|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to make a decision as to how to tackle the diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: can play i suppose to ruff 2 hearts in dummy|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you ask then too much|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in other words, i think the disadvantages of 1C outweight the advantages|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I believe Frank is at the venue in Ålesund|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andersk: If you all look at the butler scoores, then you understand why Im here and not playing:)|pg||
nt|djneill: I have a big cousin in name only - Bruce Neill of Australia|pg||
nt|Walddk5: but apparently afk at the moment|pg||

nt|djneill: ok is this making?|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|sharkey: makes with the hool|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sharkey: W wud be better off returning @DQ and E had to duck.  Think that would have ensured 1 down on overruff|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive this will end -3 and 150 while NS have 10 in @S. So 1 or 10 IMP gain for Singsås it seems.|pg||

pc|d5|pc|h9|nt|geot: Hi guys. Lets hope Førde can fight back a bit in this secon half of the match. What they were able to show in the first half was unfortunately not their usual level at all |pg||
nt|james_h: Anyone can have an unlucky day at the office|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Running scores at  http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1074140R|pg||
nt|geot: sure. We have all been there:)|pg||
nt|andersk: lets see if Hjelmeland can male this|pg||
nt|andersk: make|pg||
nt|rv: declarer needs to take @s finesse, if he plays @s from top, 4-1 break might scuttle the contract|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sharkey: Not many use weak 2@D opener - I believe it sometimes is very effective|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway -500 not too bad for NS:)|pg||
nt|djneill: there is a general rule that against 3-suiters, you want to lead trumps - it is just a rule that works - and West has a semi-3suited hand, so South's trump switch was reasonable|pg||
nt|maribelxx: 4 @H might have been an interesting contract btw|pg||
pc|s9|pc|hK|nt|andyv:  true|pg||
nt|andyv:  vs. 550:)|pg||
nt|andersk: probably misses it now|pg||
nt|james_h: If this score was a mountain, I'd stay at base camp :)|pg||
nt|rv: he might go down playing for 3-2 break|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|lestergold: cant go wrong as cards lie|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe he will top play, since they are 65 behindf|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcwla: On Board 1, 5@D was doubled in the OR and made on the lead of the @CT.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 9 tricks the limit - can set up a long @H for @C discard|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hagz: wd|pg||
nt|andersk: and he did|pg||
nt|djneill: nothing to say here, 3-3 @h and 3-2 @s|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: good slam to bid and make|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jaapfr: 6|pg||

nt|Walddk5: How is your team doing, Anders? Can they afford to bench you? :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|anton72: what is a player positions on screen sides .... S- E ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Multi|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H very likely may be the final contract here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think N wud be very ambisious to look for more - 4333 and 12 HCP|pg||
nt|rodal f: I belive W will reopen and end in 3@D?|pg||
nt|andersk: They can afford it, for sure:)|pg||
nt|stoffers: resultater så langt: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1074140|pg||
nt|rodal f: An other interestin board, but the % is bad for 6|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  ok, I'm blind... where did the @d loser go?|pg||
nt|djneill: other room starting with the end of the set: brds 15 and 16, so we will get results in a few minutes for brd 1|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|marlowepi: S hand a reasonable opening at these colors|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will they try a new hard one NS?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nope.|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie e/w has more play for 4@s than n/s has for 4@h in spite of the hcp distribution in n/s favour|pg||
nt|lestergold: north passing i assume a strong nt holding a 9 count??|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it happens its a winning decision|pg||
nt|rodal f: The NT use to be 15-17 but can be 14 at there CC.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well must be something like that but there is serious risk of missing a game|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: SV|pg||
mb|d!|nt|sharkey: Pd needs the perfect hand to make game; according to Hamman he never has...|pg||
nt|rodal f: CC servedagain for NS: http://www.nmlag.com/var/fckeditor/nmlag/file/2010/Singsas/Systemkort%20Kare%20og%20Jan%20Emil.pdf|pg||
nt|jaheim: Shoudnt be difficult to bid and play|pg||
nt|andersk: I have not played my best bridge, not as bad as the butler(My feeling) but totaly ok to sit over and take a break|pg||
nt|anton72: takk|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: N will raise|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree there.|pg||
nt|larsarthur: conservative pass|pg||
nt|maribelxx: After 5 rounds Namsos BK is in the lead with 95 and Studentenes BK lies in 7th place with 65.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jaapfr: trow in N and in double renonce extra trick so 5 was sure|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @C @S @D @D and 11 tr|pg||
nt|andyv:  right...11 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  you dbl with S hand 2N here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Still in US Carl?|pg||
nt|sharkey: since 3@D makes gain 1 imp|pg||
nt|rv: my personal belief is if you are down by any margin (large or small), it is best to play as accurately as possible and hope for luck and opps to make mistakes, playing against odds ...|pg||
nt|rv: is not correct strategy ever:)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jaapfr: a scary bidding board|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Anton and welcome:) SW at same side of the screen|pg||
nt|anton72: looks like boring 110 ...no poss for extra tricks for defence or declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: -200 or even -300 to punish W for his 2nt bd|pg||
nt|andyv:  I like when I raise my partner's suit and he/she finds another suit to lead.|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all sorry I am late |pg||
nt|andyv:  never to late, Shirley:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi Shirley|pg||
nt|rodal f: No minisplinter on for NS it seems, but then S would have signed off anyway.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 tricks with this lead.|pg||
nt|jaheim: it looks like 9 tricks|pg||
nt|maribelxx: VIkersund second 90 and Singsås third 74|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: no - sunny Stavanger :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect if D were Kxx and clubs KQxx, he would have been more likely to open|pg||
nt|djneill: ok @h lead which gives up the suit, but if South ducks, there goes the entry to the @c, so South should rise with the @hA|pg||
nt|djneill: @c behave, so 10 tops - 6@c, 2@h, 1@s, 1@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: can not get greedy on this hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|larsarthur: probably|pg||
nt|anton72: Hi ... thx ...just was wondered who was explained 2 NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Brb 3-4 min|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  too:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i dislike 2nt bid W|pg||
nt|andyv:  because of 3rd seat opener, S was not tempted to dbl opps into game|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree with u Mike. A invit would have been normal.|pg||
nt|maribelxx: I assume 2@D was a Michaels' type bid... interesting use of the tool|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rodal f: OK. So nice weather there two:) Welcome back home.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  I don't mind it... W is a passed hand and can expect a bit better @c suit than pd put down|pg||
nt|jcwla: Pass seems normal on the actual hand, though reasonable intermediates and medium spots make it look not totally watered-down.|pg||
nt|andersk: still 4 matches to go, and a long way to go, so medal is still possible if we improve!|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I second that; I have been in that position too often for comfort|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once again it may be systemic, but i am not keen on the sequence chosen by E here. Even facing a PH, this E hand has significant game potential in a suit, so i would want to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maximize our opportunities to show suits|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 20 HCP and 4 card support for pard, e will be disappointed there is no Grand slam|pg||
nt|james_h: I do sometimes do in the last segment of the Bermuda Bowl when 16+ behind|pg||
nt|rv: @C lead and @d switch required to beat this which is double dummy defebse|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzkn: V, but there also seems to be a wrong explenation so we will see.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sharkey: been here a while now - only leave during cold season...|pg||
nt|jaheim: Flått is prob thinking about the Q of @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: They picked up the cards wrong so Flått opened in 1 heart. All bids alerted after 1 heart.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s what I doÂ´nt like with 2 NT - how many @H has West - you never know|pg||
nt|rv: normal @d lead should result in 10 tricks|pg||
nt|andersk: When all 5 players have been under pari, it is not easy. The easy part is that we cant blame any but ouhrselves:)|pg||
nt|djneill: yes, only way for more than 10 is if opponents pitch hearts and spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or Christer?|pg||
nt|jaheim: but always afraid of @c 5-3|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rv: Anders, are the top Norwegian pairs like Helgemo-Helness, Grotheim-Tundal, Brogeland-pd playing this event?|pg||
nt|andersk: No|pg||
nt|andersk: They are not qualyfied (Im not sure if they played from start)|pg||
nt|james_h: and Geo has gone south for the Spring|pg||
nt|geot: :)|pg||
nt|andersk: This event is played like 6 rounds of knockout matches, then 8 teams meet for a final long weekend|pg||
nt|james_h: and NZ dollars :)|pg||
nt|geot: he he|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|rv: ok, still presume quality of bridge on display is quite high|pg||
nt|maribelxx: That was new treatment to me when I played with a norwegian in april here in Finland :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hawe45:  Perfect|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rodal f: LOL:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and pray clubs behave|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sharkey: cannot see any possibility of this making - but have a poor track record in predicting....|pg||
nt|maribelxx: But there are so many gadgets in the world|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he has picked the hearts well|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andyv:  question really is if E should leave the 2N bid in|pg||
nt|jaapfr: good question imo:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 6NT to guard the @S tenace|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c8|nt|jcwla: Eh la la.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|jaheim: big question @s 3-3? or @c 5-3|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jaapfr: but 3@C will get a X by S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: although i still like 3@C by E|pg||
nt|lestergold: can make 3N on this line|pg||
nt|jaheim: soon  next board  zzzzzzzz|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|djneill: South is pressurizing E-W with the long suit - sometimes odd things happen|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to play safe tho to ensure 1N|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  I like 3@c just to keep my partners happy|pg||
nt|jaheim: winning line|pg||
pc|h9|nt|maribelxx: I like south's 3NT bid|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jaapfr: :)|pg||
nt|james_h: my experience is that there is great strength in depth in Norge|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|anton72: not so clear line to bid 4 @s ...so I think can be 2 VP from result after match|pg||

nt|vugraphzkn: N diddent see pds 1nt opening|pg||
nt|andersk: top 8 club teams, this year:)|pg||
nt|stoffers: was out getting food, question was?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: partial here may be 3@C for NS.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: I think e/w will try 4 @S here at the end of the day |pg||
nt|jaapfr: still   Studentenes sounds very female to me but do not master Norwegian|pg||
nt|andyv:  S took a far more aggressive stance on board 1 and found the excellent save of 5@d for 9 imp gain|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR|pg||
nt|rv: so quality of bridge on display should definitely be of high standard|pg||
nt|djneill: that @h suit was an example of keeping the final contract in sight, and not mechanically play the suit by itself |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: On Board 1 Studentenes have picked up 11 IMPs - not 10.  6@S at this table was off 2.  This will be corrected|pg||
nt|rodal f: By his 9HP Forfot ain't fare away for a normalopening.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: Shud be some action here?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sharkey: 3@C some kind of mixed raise?|pg||
nt|jcwla: N must be thinking it's a pinochle deck.|pg||
nt|rodal f: So by the screens N are same blind I am witout screens?:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah that explains |pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: funny faces in here :-)|pg||
mb|d!|nt|sharkey: So far NS have not been able to introduce their @D suit - may be too late now|pg||
nt|sybarra: or will E venture 3 nt at some point |pg||
nt|andyv:  actually N deserves the credit for dbling 4@s|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|rodal f: At board 2 OR are on there way for 6@S. 4@H splinter at W so fare|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: West opens a feather light vulnerable 1@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Rekstad originally played for another Topbridge team but lost to Vikersund in the 3d knockout match. He is hungry for revenge.|pg||
nt|stoffers:  i use it, some dont. I'm quitting it soon, going over to invitational bids directly instead 1@s-3@h invitational and @h :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|andersk: we also have another team event plaing like a premier leuage, two 2. divisjons 8 3. divisjons etc, premier leuage is the top team event, this is the top club team event|pg||
nt|rv: do EW play standard or a limited system?|pg||
nt|james_h: Any kibs have outline system info?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 5-5-4-2 with transfers after 1cl openings|pg||
nt|djneill: unsupported Queen and Jack are dubious|pg||
nt|anton72: trum lead beat it|pg||
nt|jaheim: how can u stop Bremset with 14 points?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: south cannot make anything at the 3 level|pg||
nt|sybarra: but its a good hand! |pg||
nt|rodal f: 6@S came at board 2 OR. So a swing it magistern.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can end up in 3NT also but that would be a bad contract on @H lead.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sharkey: Kib informs 3@C asks for strength and suit quality|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6!@S probably down 1 although 5@S likely to be +1|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3 NT shows max|pg||
nt|rodal f: U have the funniest any way Torstein:) I will come to Ålesund tomorrow non. Will be nice to see u again.|pg||
nt|djneill: you like the long @d suit shirley?  looks nice|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6/4 with spades |pg||
nt|mcarroll: not quite a Roland 19-21 and it looks like the 19 count wins|pg||
nt|djneill: welcome martin|pg||
nt|jaheim: 4@s best contract but............ will go down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes-they have 9 tricks at @S contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkn: NS precision club|pg||
nt|andersk: normally there are 5-8 very good teams in this team final, some years the level is not abselout top|pg||
nt|geot: The nightmare for Førde seems to continue. The 4@S North went down in here (board 18) was played in 4@H at the other table, won by Cantona Nybo. 13 impsmore|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Dan, Shirley|pg||
nt|djneill: ok so another entry-related hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|stoffers: no 3@c in passoutseat?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: so wise of NS to stay out of the bidding as appears 5@D x wud be off 800|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jaapfr: good leading technique|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rv: par contract is 5@d for EW though 4@s makes as well|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like PA is trying to play 4@S |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|geot: In 5@D you have to guess the trumps|pg||
nt|james_h: another reason to take the normal line|pg||
nt|djneill: pretty much no way to get to the @d so East must duck a @d, even if South covers|pg||
nt|stoffers: -1 now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would u have done at vul?|pg||
nt|stoffers: indeed..knowing opps have a 9 card fit, they will probabyly fight once more|pg||
nt|stoffers: and vul its 670, nv only 470|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive Allars will thing a bit more at safetyplay after the @HA. Hum|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Allard picks up a card in every suit in his hand. Not sure which route to take.|pg||
nt|rodal f: What would X from N be after 3@C. But hard to come with it if for pan..|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi all. Sr for the con problems:( Running scores: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1074140R|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  W's 5@s bid asked for what?|pg||
nt|andyv:  club control or trump?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @S support i say|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi:) Normaly trumh cuality.|pg||
nt|andyv:  if so, then 6@s was optomistic by E|pg||
nt|rodal f: quality*|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even wrong bid E|pg||
nt|rv: how many brds per round, we seem to have started off with a huge score in favor or Namsos BK?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: as he does|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcwla: Will we get a failing @H finesse?|pg||
nt|geot: 16 boards|pg||
nt|andersk: 16 a round  32 a match|pg||
pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: apparently systemic to open 1H on the W hand|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|larsarthur: how can it fail?|pg||
nt|maribelxx: In NT @H8 provides a stopper|pg||
nt|rodal f: CC for EW: http://www.nmlag.com/var/fckeditor/nmlag/file/2010/Studentenes/skjetne-forfot.pdf|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sharkey: i predict 10 tricks - probably wrong again....|pg||
nt|rodal f: At NS i must look it up. Brb.|pg||
nt|maribelxx: these length stoppers are often overlooked... |pg||
mc|9|nt|jaapfr: better claim down 1 to make dummy not too ashamed:)|pg||
nt|rv: East will pass and West will bid 5@d to deny first round control|pg||
nt|maribelxx: but here of course, only 8 tricks anyway when losing two spades too|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Ringseth claimed 9 at this point. They surely do not waste any time.|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Y:) But a normal NT opening in Norway.|pg||
nt|rodal f: So next board to wait for?|pg||
nt|djneill: but magic|pg||

nt|rnmalik: friendly cards for 4@H for NS.|pg||

nt|andyv:  normal for California too:)|pg||

nt|rv: I am told it is|pg||
nt|andersk: I think it is|pg||
nt|djneill: South knows what is coming|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: EAfter East's 4@S west will not move towards slam; perhaps a little "heavy" non-vul|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think many players would have opted for 1@S instead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Which major du you lead?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will a invit come from S and if... will take it? 3NT seems on|pg||
nt|rodal f: will N take it*|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Stop the E/W wagon, I want to get off|pg||
nt|rv: once partner doesn't super-accept your transfer, you would tend to pass with 8 hcp and invite only with 9 on 5332 or 5422 shape|pg||
nt|james_h: 4s easier in practice|pg||
nt|andersk: Førde again trying to get back by bidding too much|pg||
nt|stoffers: that 2@h bid deserves a huuuuge penalty..|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@D now show some cards. If not lebensol 2NT as order for E to bid 3@C and 31D tell minimum hand at W|pg||
nt|stoffers: vulnerable, passed partner...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jaheim: my guess i mean|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcwla: Can still do it.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Back in a flash.|pg||
nt|stoffers: its different to show cards and have 100 honours in an unbid suit frank, i bid 4@d|pg||
nt|rodal f: A @H lead will come from N. But at 6@D it need to be the K for @C swich|pg||

nt|stoffers: how can N lead a@h? :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||

nt|maribelxx: This should be quite straight forward play, at least I don't see any big problems|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rodal f: Style and deal I belive, but after the bids from W it seems correct. Or?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|rv: this is not the way to get back, you only slide further more often that:)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|larsarthur: :(|pg||
nt|james_h: I tend to go with all 9 hcp except flat with no 10's and 9's|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: You as many others would have done I belive. It's only a @C lead that keep them of 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|djneill: knowing the split - any singleton with East leaves 4 @d losers, North is not unhappy to let West ruff|pg||
nt|djneill: when West passes a 2-level takeout, it shows a stack|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ure right. Normal for many to take the @HK, but not for all.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|andyv:  I see more of an advantage for DONT in direct seat... in pass out seat, something simpler might be better|pg||
nt|stoffers: how Rekstad can find his 4@h and 5@c bid i really dont understand|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|stoffers: partner has bid 3@d..he didnt act over 2@h,...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Eliassen shakes his head and mumbles to himself.|pg||
nt|stoffers: he cant be that good, and i would say he's got a strong maximum for his bidding so far|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|sybarra: I often play a system in direct seat and natural in pass out seat (or landy only) |pg||

mc|9|nt|sharkey: Even with @C lead I believe slam makes as @D set up|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South was end-played in the lead - only one of three could beat 3 NT|pg||

nt|nielsfoged:  Most important issue: be confindent that your partner NEVER psychs with his 2@c opening!|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  white vs red|pg||

nt|lestergold: north's 2 points are working very haARD INDEED|pg||
nt|djneill: ok in other room brd 2, same contract and defense, but East embarked on a total crossruff that was unlucky when North was short in @c - one trick short|pg||
nt|djneill: East had not tested the @h early, so did not know about that split|pg||

mb|p|nt|james_h: If I were in the NS position, its time to revert to A game and try to salvage pride and practise mental toughness|pg||

mb|4D|nt|marlowepi: N should have led Q of diamonds, or at least the ten|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a view a punt hard to bid it accurately|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not to much info to find at there CC after 2@C opening: http://www.nmlag.com/var/fckeditor/nmlag/file/2010/Singsas/Systemkort%20Kare%20og%20Jan%20Emil.pdf|pg||
nt|lestergold: yje stiff hert is an obvious value to N but how can he know how imprtant the Q@c is?|pg||
nt|djneill: ok a 3crd @h raise - it is fine but takes a little judgement or gadgetry to then show that - I think requiring 4 cards is a reasonable agreement|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: S is being pragmatic opening the 5 card @S suit - this in order he'll be able to show both suits|pg||
nt|stoffers: 3nt was very nice, but diamonds dont behave, but in 4@h they do after this lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still Allard got it as he wanted, but don't know yet:)|pg||
nt|stoffers: best is to duck it around ofcource, then he will have trouble getting to thm later|pg||

nt|marlowepi: useful for NS to play transfers in this situation|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  W not elated with the dbl|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The defence to the Multi Two Diamonds is fundamentally different from the defence to a weak two for a number of reasons: |pg||
nt|andyv:  2N leb?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then can raise to 2S in two different ways, distinguishing pure obstruction from some genuine values|pg||
nt|djneill: some might open South's hand 2@c based on the large number of tricks, right?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes I think the S hand should use whatever forcing opening they use, I would open 2@C|pg||
nt|djneill: 2@c being a strong ART bid, for any poles|pg||
nt|anton72: nice spot ...120|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Simonsen needed a small break after the last one to reboot so we start again.|pg||

nt|rv: anyone for transfers on 1m-1n?|pg||
nt|james_h: I prefer 2n to 2@h|pg||

nt|rodal f: Seems so now. When 3@H came|pg||
nt|andyv:  looking for 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 2 nt 3 cl 3h should be alerted|pg||
nt|h_karluk: So does that make defending against the multi 2? easier or more difficult than against a weak two? In my opinion there's no problem  as long as you are sensible about it. ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Basically, assume that the 2D opener has a weak 2H/S hand. |pg||
nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx Torstein:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: :-)|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would expect most to double.  Meanwhile, this seems somewhat meek.|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: There are numerous variations of the multi 2D, so let's assume a fairly basic one (weak major; strong minor or strong balanced). The suggested defence does not really change if ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there are other possibilities such as 4441 distributions  assume a weak opener. |pg||
nt|andyv:  like all systems...after a while a decent defense or multiple defenses are found and then we wait for the newest development.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: this is my laste Geir will now join |pg||
nt|lestergold: well both n/s stretching their values here |pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: bye all see you tomorrow|pg||

nt|james_h: another find the lady hand|pg||
nt|rv: in any case it is best to play some science, either transfers or artificial 2n response as suggested by Anders|pg||
nt|maribelxx: I wonder what was 3 @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: you can freely bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: as is the club holding |pg||
nt|andyv:  but will be difficult to find Q@d unless following the Crane rule:)|pg||

nt|sharkey: Good - by Norwegian standards...|pg||
nt|sharkey: On board 5 Grand bid slam in OR - thus the lead is narrowed to 4 IMPs|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer probably should ask if N would ruff holding Qx(x) of @d since N knows that E is also void in @hs|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: small coffe and sig...breake|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 5 min...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: foto from the first half  www.nmlag.com/Bildegalleri/Kamp-1|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: back|pg||
nt|sybarra: Pix almost look like team orange of the Neth. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: with only 3 mediocre hearts, i prefer 2C over an iummediate double. the double can come next time|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would have floated 2@s with north and i wouldnt have been tioo excited about the quality of my spade suit as south|pg||
nt|lestergold: im hardly one of those|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|djneill: that would work - North would rebid something over 2@h like 2@s, and South would rebid 4@d maybe (or 3@d)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3NT S at OR.|pg||
nt|rodal f: I was a bit wrong at board 6. 7@S also on by two reed ruffs and a auto hook are up.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodal f: Sr. The CC are oposit. CC for NS is: http://www.nmlag.com/var/fckeditor/nmlag/file/2010/Harstad/Systemkort%20Harr-Bremseth.pdf|pg||
mb|d|nt|mcarroll: Even worse, if opps bid to a @H or@D slam it takes a @C lead to beat it|pg||
nt|rnmalik: big hand in S and all key cards with W. |pg||
mb|2H!|nt|rodal f: Slam time but also a sac by 800 for EW in @S.|pg||
nt|lestergold: politics in uk has become very promiscuous with all sorts of incompatible people jumping intop political beds with each other|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR ended 5@DX|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@H a good lift in @S I belive|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|3H!|nt|sharkey: This is a hard slam to bid I think, Frank|pg||
nt|sharkey: After East's 1@D opening....|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree there, but on.|pg||
nt|djneill: lol yes balancing into a slam is a great way to endear yourself to partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: @C support and @S controll|pg||
nt|djneill: East invites here?|pg||
nt|maribelxx: Guessing that east can make distinction of 3 card raise and 4 card raise|pg||
mb|3S|nt|james_h: I am so rooting for NS to get off the mark|pg||
nt|rv: 3n is best contract here though 4@s and 5@d make as well|pg||
nt|anton72: 5 @d looks 300|pg||
nt|maribelxx: Useful infor for partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 2@S some kind of good raise after West's neg x?|pg||
nt|andyv:  any thoughts about 1N vs. 1@S on this one?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: at last we see the transfer-over 1@C- opening in action |pg||
nt|djneill: South doubles 3@c, ha|pg||
nt|jaheim: 2 NT prob 22-24 bal|pg||
nt|maribelxx: *info|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: Skriver det umiddelbart da,så har du det før kvelden, ok|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Leading the @C Jack might have been interesting|pg||
nt|rv: I might have opened 1@s even playing strong @c system with North hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: Feel 2@S a bit hard there. Ain't re X better?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i prefer the 1s overcall to start with and then later the takeout double as recommended in Robert Owen's excellent book on doubes etc|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Very much so!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same contract as OR.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|djneill: West immediately signed off - I don't like that - 4 trumps and a little distribution|pg||
nt|sybarra: my say I am surpised we have not see a @D bid by N |pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: the W hand is not a 1 nt pattern for me |pg||
nt|djneill: what a @d suit :-)|pg||
nt|sybarra: my=must|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|rodal f: NS also played the team final in Tønsberg some years ago. Don't remeber when but some spec might know.|pg||
nt|andersk: mee too|pg||
nt|rodal f: At board 6 OR was inside 7@S but N bidded 7NT:)|pg||
nt|maribelxx: I hear that summer has just begun in Norway too, very nice (we have +25C in Finland)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rodal f: U still have ure 3-4 in minor and heard 1@S at left side. HUM.|pg||
nt|rodal f: And same lead|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|mcarroll: and had a second chance|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@D negative or waiting?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jaheim: Wd to stop in 4 @S|pg||
nt|rodal f: At aeria Ålesund it have been 0-7C by daytime til last 3 days by nice sunny weather. Now ca. 10-12C So hot for us and T-shirt on.|pg||
nt|maribelxx: Time to think first, not too many losers but you have to envisage your tricks too|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|djneill: anyways, good stop as North will be able to overruff @c|pg||
nt|djneill: even 1 @h pitch will not be enough (on the @d)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andersk: I feel sorry for førde now|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|rv: Anders, are these clubs sposored by any corporates or do players have to fend for their own expenses?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rv: yes if this was a boxing match, refree would have stopped contest:)|pg||
nt|andersk: Norwegian bridge federation i paying for the travel exspenses, and the clubs(usually) pay for the hotells etc.|pg||
nt|rv: good, atleast players don't have to spend too much from their pockets and can concentrate on the game|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andersk: My club pay for the hotell, and we players only have to pay for the food we eat (exsept from the food included in the hotell)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|rodal f: % for 5@Sw and 1@S E is 7.25 Finding the A single behind make it down to 1.1% some said here.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with negative 2@D has no choice but to pass 4@S.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|james_h: Yes, all the expences are the down side of finding good competitions|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|c7|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as that's done already:) And have a @H hook to use if needed.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Board 7 at OR also ended at 6@D by @H10 as lead.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Ringseth puts his card on the table and takes his time. Trying to find a way to set this.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to David Edwin|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jaheim: and 11 tricks,  maybee on a show up squeeze|pg||
nt|rv: unfortunately in most sports (except boxing), match continues till the end irrespective of margin at any stage|pg||
nt|anton72: 4 imps .. for Studentene R or S ?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anyway a good page to load: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm|pg||
nt|maribelxx: Something black perhaps , but which one|pg||
nt|maribelxx: Good afternoon David!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|anton72: i think R is correctly or i am wrong|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: well that is a good reason why i want to get the spade off my chest at the one level|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|rodal f: At 22 E opened with the 10 bad points and bidded his @S 5th 3 times. W ended at 4@HX and 800 for 11IMP.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: even with 2 @C discards has 11 tricks.|pg||
nt|ady: hi Lea|pg||
nt|maribelxx: A club brokes communication to take two heart ruffs|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzkn: Bremset tried to claim 12 but had to accept 11|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rodal f: As u said from ure place at eart Andy:) Standard 1NT opening in Norway I wrote 2 boards ago.|pg||
nt|rodal f: By there system I belive a bid is max 15HP bad. So need to X and bid for show 16 - 18(19)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: we had more chance of getting tgo a sensible spot like in diamodns had we overcalled 1 spade to start with|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if there was a systematic bar then fair enough|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same u have by the new X for show cards. Can't see the problem.|pg||
nt|lestergold: competingin my view needs more flexible systems|pg||
nt|maribelxx: which might have been the way to find the necessary tricks|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rodal f: I just wonder if S had the posebility for a 4@H bid after 2@S as exlution blackwood?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Grand has assumed the lead - OR went down in 4@H Bd 6 where Frank wanted to bid slam :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rodal f: OR here OR ended 3@S by minisplinter from E X at S and REX fromW as first control|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rodal f: Again a thing by agreements.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|h_karluk: I choose 1@s|pg||
nt|maribelxx: with only ruff entry, he cannot take heart finesse|pg||

nt|marlowepi: ok. this is a bit too free though:)|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzbv: what was his alternatives?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lucky they have not propelled EW to slam, having told them how to make it|pg||
nt|vugraphzbv: were*|pg||

mb|p|nt|nielsfoged:  ...etc|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H or 4H yes.|pg||
nt|vugraphzbv: i dont see what 2@H would accomplish, though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what it accomplishes is not giving away the spade position|pg||
pc|cA|nt|nielsfoged:  now 3@h is more likely to have @sQx|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  (Zia)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  4@h would "give" the play, and 2@h would make it even more dificult than 2@h|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when you have a stiff spade and opps have already announced the suit, the preempt has less to gain, because they have already found their fit and can outbid you ate same level|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  than 3@h|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  when the 5 card suit is @ss and you only have 2@h, it seems like 1@s is more efficient....if the 5 card suit is @H, then the advantage of 1N is a preemptive bid against @ss.|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be a relief to both in comparison to push that bd|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: wow grand!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Atthe OR W didn't bid so then 2@S was a normal bid.|pg||
nt|djneill: in the other room, North played a low @c from the Ace, getting a @c trick before the ruffing began|pg||
nt|djneill: then played loser on loser when West did ruff the 2nd @c|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rv: this is another hand to test NS resolve, they will do well to stop at 2 level in a partial|pg||
nt|sybarra: and what do they play here|pg||
nt|djneill: interesting canape|pg||
nt|djneill: canape means you bid a 4 card suit before the 5 card suit - sometimes not even not knowing which the 5 card suit is :-)|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|lestergold: vul granny time folks|pg||
nt|sybarra: think it has another name|pg||
nt|sybarra: raptor? or |pg||
nt|rodal f: JH. Skoglund opend 2@D a major???? At N.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: bd 20 as we expected 6 @S very costly as the OR rested quietly in 4 @S|pg||
nt|djneill: East might pass this|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3NT at OR and a @C lead|pg||
nt|maribelxx: right, so he cleard the situation better :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B8 ended 3@S+1 at OR so 1IMPfor Namsos.|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|andyv:  boards 19 thru 22 have wiped out the Student's comeback|pg||
nt|h_karluk: looking into future is not a bad thing, however i am expected to tell partner what i have in my hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bad hand for forcing NT, one of many reasons why so many top players no longer play it, whereas not that long ago it was the norm|pg||
nt|rodal f: Inv minor 10HP+ at 2@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@h??|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Was told that NS was in the final in 2000 and 2004, so there 3rd one now.|pg||
nt|lestergold: south needs to try and take up max space here|pg||
nt|lestergold: feeble|pg||
nt|jaheim: pass?, strange bid  |pg||
nt|rodal f: Same end at OR if pass.|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 6@S if peeking at the spade position   but a poor contract|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|sharkey: Trouble if Skjetne puts up th @CQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: So seems as bough EW tables lost the winning 3@S.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@C/@S on-slam time.|pg||
nt|jaheim: 6  @C @S and NT|pg||
mb|5S|nt|rodal f: Would be the nice bid Mike:) Exlution to many pairs use to forget.|pg||
nt|lestergold: south shopul;d have donned brown corduroy trousers and barraged big time|pg||
nt|djneill: West has 9 HCP and a source of tricks vulnerable opposite 15-17, I hope West thinks this is forcing, and also hope East does|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: I didn't exspect the Q there. Had time to wait:(|pg||
nt|sharkey: Afraid of @S shift|pg||
nt|sharkey: This hand plays better Double Dummy - Skjetne's play not unreasonable |pg||
nt|sybarra: I will correct my statement, I actually would open 1 nt,  (for some reason I though he had 6 sp, hence the not my pattern)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah playing forcing NT they would get to 2@S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Wrong hand asking:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Forde have opened their account|pg||
nt|maribelxx: This is the first half of this match from round 6. In this final stage 8 teams have qualified to play this weekend.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Skjetne got problems to tell the renons at @H and Forfot belive a singleton.|pg||
nt|maribelxx: and the club team championship will be decided in 7 matches, the last round to be seen on BBO tonight.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: 2S might well make, i was thinking of 3C|pg||
nt|hagz: OR 7 @c|pg||
nt|djneill: ok only way this goes down is if West ruffs high on the 3rd @c, but the @s6 then !7 is not from shortness - did South show 4@s specifically I wonder|pg||
nt|djneill: 3rd @s sorry|pg||
nt|rodal f: Am not shure if N see 4@C as que, but belive so. Anyway a easy slam.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: forgive the expression but being a money player ui dont like paying out to vul grannies|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well i dont fully understand bidding system, but was this that difficuklt a grand to reach|pg||
nt|rodal f: As Mike said.          The bid from W was 5@H over 3@H.|pg||
nt|lestergold: nol i said that south should have bid 5@h to take up space but having only bid 3@h west needed 5@h as unambiguous void showing and grand slam try|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rodal f: Wich at wourst can be 4N 3S? Had time to wait. Or what Carl?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some specs might wonder what 5@H would have ment.|pg||
nt|andersk: run @D 6 now|pg||
nt|jaheim: well this is a smokngboard 4 me,   my secretary will take over|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@S-3@H at S and at W in OR and end 6@S|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jaheim: Hello I´m Ingrid Jan:s secretary|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|nt|djneill: important to inquire about agreements, at least above the club level (then it just helps them )|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi|pg||
nt|rodal f: First big "swing it magistern".|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|jcwla: That's not happening -- at least not as a result of forcing NT.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, non-forcing NT would be a lovely idea if 1NT meant "I have a nice balanced minimum responding hand."|pg||
pc|s9|nt|andyv:  undertrick time|pg||
nt|jcwla: Unfortunately, much of the time it means "I have some shapely hand that doesn't have enough strength to bid at the 2 level."|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bidding small only wsas very expensive i think specs would mostly understand that as meaning the only thing it coluld mean|pg||
nt|rodal f: So u have started with employers out at the buch Jan Arne:) Out for some ice fishing?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rnmalik: 10 @S and claim please.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|maribelxx: I found the results on this page http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1074140|pg||
nt|rodal f: X at W sr specs|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: yes it is fairly normal to bid 2S despite the poor holding and the good clubs--my point is that playing forcing NT really S has no idea of which black suit will be best|pg||
nt|rodal f: It's exslution blackwood. HOW many aces do u have pard exsept in @H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|djneill: South pitched a low @c, probably encouragement|pg||
nt|jaheim: next weekend|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: what was that 12 imps or so|pg||
nt|lestergold: and e/w cannot afford yhis sort of loss|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 6 clubs showed 2 aces and a void|pg||
nt|rv: they are not bagelled (6-0 in tennis) or got a pair (0 in cricket)|pg||
nt|anton72: he not take @s A??|pg||
nt|rodal f: When W enter at @DK in OR he need to play @HQ. And he is at the tank now.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: sry, shld be two. I will correct the movie|pg||
nt|anton72: aha|pg||
nt|rodal f: U'll do by no problem Geir:))|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|djneill: which is important if North has the @cK and not the @sQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: there was a way to beat this,  but certainly no evidient to either n or s |pg||
nt|djneill: the @c8 would not be from @cK8 so South is not looking to return a @c - North surely would have led a stiff @c off the bat with a stiff|pg||
nt|maribelxx: The Championship site is http://www.nmlag.com/|pg||
nt|ady: now regretting being in 5    but will beok|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
nt|djneill: ok|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sharkey: If S were to lead @CJ dummy's @C7 becomes a stopper|pg||
nt|marlowepi: whereas if N can rebid 2C over NF 1N, S can afford to raise|pg||
nt|djneill: perhaps South is a bit confused about West's @h length|pg||
nt|djneill: I am|pg||
nt|jaheim: still winter in the mountains|pg||

nt|jcwla:  There is a little bit of ambiguity in the black suits but non-forcing NT not the solution, imho.|pg||

nt|rv: in last deal playing standard, if North rebids 2@h NS will stop at safe level, if North had rebid 2@d they could go overboard|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: On the previous board - I believe E had to finesse @H8 for 9th trick - even after a "friendly lead" - so very possible down OR as well|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@H-2 at OR on board 9|pg||

mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: I guess opening 1N when you've 5 cards good or bad M suit is just a gross distortion, you don't know the others. simplest example, you can save yr life starting with 1@H/@s and ...|pg||

nt|h_karluk: luck|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a LOT of ambiguity, and if 1N nonforcing then a 2C rebid by N shows 4+ clubs which is an adavantage. the question is how big an advantage it will be, and how often, and ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how these pros and cons measure against all the other ones that must be entered into the balance sheet to evaluate the respective methods|pg||
nt|rodal f: Spot to come and 3@C as the best but will NS fight with 3@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Blood to come?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not sure everyone agrees with 1@H at these colors....|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, 2@S by an opener and a min responder on a 5-2 fit in preference to a notional 4-4 3@C will at least be reasonable -- non-forcing 1NT can lead to a contract that is just ...|pg||

nt|rv: seems to be some confusion, 2@h double was intended as t/o or strong bal|pg||
nt|anton72: declarer have 10 and 9|pg||
mb|1N|nt|djneill: Studentenes BK is on the board finally with an imp!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: West won't mind defending either if pd has a @H stack|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Yes Frank - blood to come...|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Minimum 800 while 3NT also is on by 600.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Only problem for defence may be that West has no trump to lead thru|pg||
nt|rodal f: OK to show the 2 black colors by neg X, but might better to show 5 @S direct by 1@S|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rv: best to play some sohl (lebensohl, rubensohl, rumpelsohl) from South hand on double of 2@h by North|pg||
nt|james_h: oh man|pg||
nt|djneill: North went all out for extra tricks by underleading the @dKQJ :-) declarer's stiff @d8 won|pg||
nt|ady: poor opening by south   4-3-3-3 weak hand|pg||
nt|maribelxx: yes, he did guess spade - also a lot more bidding from opps|pg||

nt|jaheim: time to take toptricks now|pg||
nt|rv: a practical option is one suggested by Anders which is passing with South hand|pg||
pc|c8|nt|djneill: ok 11 flat may not be an invite, but vulnerable at imps, you don't think - you trust to the randomness of the cards that gives you imp odds for game: just 37% vulnerable game ...|pg||
nt|djneill: required to break even, and that is not counting bad defense|pg||

nt|djneill: either way, East should present a @h Jack or Ten, to induce a cover, even if really finessing the other way|pg||
nt|djneill: for instance, if East was on the board now, East could play the @hJ - planning on overtaking and hooking the other way|pg||
nt|djneill: North has no idea that East has the @hT so might just cover|pg||
nt|djneill: that extra chance takes you from 50% to maybe 70%, but here there are other clues to where the long @h are|pg||
nt|djneill: South doubled 1@h for takeout, so presumably has 8 @s and @d cards|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Looks like a weak raise insteed of 3@H as many use as pre empt.|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Do you prefer 4@H or 4@S on this hand?|pg||

nt|mcarroll: oops|pg||

pc|d2|nt|maribelxx: ...or your bidding :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodal f: No normal chance to bid the slam as I see or might Lars have a route 66?|pg||

nt|h_karluk: SWEDISH JACOBY 2 NO TRUMP |pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: Hartvigsen's 3@C VUL not for the faint hearted....|pg||
nt|jcwla: A light passed-hand double by W - usually a good idea.|pg||
nt|djneill: N-S are playing in @h anyways, for 50 a pop|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: He said sorry and that he was frustrated by the slam play.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Who know Shirley?:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: My way by thinking was. @C4 have to be from a honor or singel. Then @CQ is free befor the @D test for -1 but u loose the max -2 It's team and not match.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: I understand Remvik's 4@C. Hartvigsen should have been a bit stronger for his 3@C bid.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: with only one ace, i think 3N is very dubious. 3H better then if S bids 3N fine|pg||

nt|rodal f: 2 times @H and @C give a pitch in @D at E and slam are on.|pg||
nt|jbgood: so 2 @s - and nobody agreed on 2@s |pg||
pc|h6|nt|mcarroll: and S again - again|pg||

nt|maribelxx: Taking the aces is helpful for the declarer|pg||
pc|s6|nt|djneill: if I was N-S and I knew about the 5-0 @h break, I would do anything but bleed all the trumps|pg||
nt|djneill: so defenders here should do likewise|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sharkey: @C lead works as well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 9 hcp, no trump support, perhaps 3C wld be mistaken, so easy X in competition|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  good session for BK Grand which was able to stretch out it's lead|pg||
nt|james_h: right, the club situation not clear for N|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|s4|nt|james_h: up to that point|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mcarroll: a double would have led to a 71-0 score|pg||
nt|rv: these small contracts of playing and defending 1n just don't get adequate rewards in IMPs scoring|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|rodal f: Trick one will cost many tricks now:(|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Probably makes no difference to the final result|pg||
nt|jaheim: mm   only 8 ims now, and 67- 0|pg||
mc|10|nt|jaheim: imps|pg||
nt|maribelxx: They lead diamonds at the other table|pg||

nt|h_karluk: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php |pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like there should be a slam someplace here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: kibitzers proudly welcomed|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But it was strong earlier in the round?|pg||
nt|rv: this is last deal of this round|pg||
nt|rv: thanks to excellent Vu graph operator Geir, my excellent co-commentators James and Anders|pg||
nt|james_h: Thx RV and Geo, pleasure to talk round the edges of your analysis :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: Next session will start 14:45 local time|pg||
nt|mcarroll: a tough flat board|pg||
nt|jbgood: i guess the latter is in better position to know - he is on the team|pg||
nt|maribelxx: But the same result|pg||
nt|maribelxx: Now some imps at stake?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: I had the Students as one by two favorits, but the fieald is wide open this year.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are Petter having a problem to use the finger counting HP?:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder how they only made 5N in OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  seeing a lot of red:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not much surprise easy 11 tricks|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Anyway - new board|pg||
nt|sybarra: and last bd now |pg||
nt|djneill: yep, last brd of the set coming up|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  in 6 have to take the @s hook|pg||
nt|jcwla: As we reach the last board of this segment, a big thank you to our excellent operator, Geir Harnes.  Big thanks also to the NBF and BK Grand (Petter Haram, Terje Lie).  Big thanks ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: to Roland Wald, the tireless coordinator of BBO vugraph presentations.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  NOT making 1 NT seems rather difficult, losing 4 @h, 1 @C and 1@S|pg||
nt|jaheim:   1 NTstill 10 -13   |pg||
nt|djneill: thanks martin and shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Dan and Martin |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: huge hand in N|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sorry all. It start at 09.00CET.|pg||

nt|rodal f: Next segment start in 1H 15M And same teams are up.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharkey: Will EW let opps play in 5@D Dbl?|pg||
nt|rodal f: At board 30 S passed by his 21 HP and didn't want to show the cards to his mate. YES. So many have asked so I took it publick:)))|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2IMP gain for the man with 21HP since 4@S vent -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  club leads probably preclude taking any hooks in 3N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @s hook works, no transportartion problems, flat board|pg||
nt|djneill: we could see another 5crd fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to our terrific operator, Gier |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: and mighty @d ten :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  aren't there 12 tricks?|pg||
nt|andyv:  or am I missing something?|pg||
nt|andyv:  in NT|pg||
nt|jcwla: Finally, big thanks to my fellow commentators for their excellent insights: Lars Arthur Johansen and Marshall Lewis, and of course thanks to all specs.|pg||
nt|djneill: North should pass - short @h implies E-W are missing a @h fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: @dA+ruff?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: XX = 3S|pg||
nt|sybarra: and of course thx to our specs, with all the commdents we appreciate them |pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharkey: East's Pass is forcing - what's West to do?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 6@S makes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: tough to get to S hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: for the spade hook |pg||
nt|andyv:  true|pg||

nt|vugraphzkn: :)|pg||
nt|maribelxx: All lead give something... club was chosen at both tables|pg||

nt|sharkey: *made - not mad :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @sK97x -- 9 still problem|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@D is force since Lie didn't get the chance for 3@C=second negative|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rv: also special thanks to Roland and BBO team for broadcasting such good tournies from all round the world and finally to all spectators for listening to us patiently|pg||
nt|djneill: ok the @h's are out of the bag|pg||

nt|djneill: great leat to start|pg||
nt|djneill: lead*|pg||
nt|sybarra: specs will note,  BBO does not give us free typing lessons or provide spell checker|pg||
nt|jbgood: in the open room W continued with the @h ace too...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rodal f: Thx also to the exselent vug operator Torstein Hesseberg wich his nick name, Bavianen, from his papa |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes|pg||
nt|mcarroll: this is going from bad to worse for EW|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|jaheim: I have no idea, Hans, was discussing english spelling with my secretary  :)|pg||
nt|james_h: they can on board 30 if they blast into hyperspace (6@d)|pg||
nt|rodal f: One more half match tody. It will start in 44 min. Rama will be Topbridge against Vikersund.|pg||

nt|sybarra: right,  just cash |pg||
nt|rodal f: Thanks also to the fellow comentators wich have made it a bit more easy for all of us. Specs as commentators as vug operators:) Well done.|pg||
nt|djneill: it may come down to the @c guess|pg||
nt|djneill: but there are endplay possibilities in @s too - @s and another means South will win and possibly give a ruff-sluff|pg||
nt|djneill: as North did not lead the @sK, there is small hint that South has doubleton honor|pg||
nt|djneill: @sQ here may solve it|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rodal f: Got that because of his wild biddings when ma - pa - Tora(sister) and Torstein played privat.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|maribelxx: West did not play spades... |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jaheim: think iI have to use the s-word again|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sharkey: looks like off 1 and 4 IMPs to the Students|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d8|nt|jaheim: (strange)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|maribelxx: And claiming time is near :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or ending at @S contract?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||
nt|james_h: this has been an excecise in excruciation for Forde - all efforts backfired|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rodal f: No hook for shure. Its team and not match:)|pg||
nt|djneill: if North has the @cA, then the @s trick will not work (North will get in with the @c and cash the @s)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rodal f: For new specs. The web page: http://www.nmlag.com/|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzkn: thanks all see you in 20 min|pg||

nt|maribelxx: Namsos has the lead in this match, as well as in the championship|pg||
pc|h3|nt|djneill: the pause for thought should be clear - will go for the endplay now with the @cQ (ruff last @c then 2 spades)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  ty all again|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|rv: non-playing captain or senior members of team would surely help here|pg||

nt|vugraphzkn: closing table. See you all later.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rodal f: See u :) And thx specs for ure inputs:)|pg||
