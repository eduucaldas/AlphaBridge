mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: I would overcall 2@D rather than Double on that S hand|pg||
nt|caitlin: same folks now play 'chicken gambling' which allows you to have an outside Ace or King:)|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|s4|nt|caitlin: other than slam|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

pc|d7|pc|s8|nt|sybarra: Is there a team called  "die Musketiere" ?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: declarer has to hope trumps are not 4-1|pg||
nt|rnmalik: that solves the 2 @S loser problem.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: yes, its Hartmut Kondoch with Felix Zimmermann, with two French Juniors|pg||

mc|12|nt|h_karluk: or to find a parking place and reduce down a @c loser|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nicely done|pg||
nt|xenya: normal contract after N has opened 1N. This goes down a few -- but perhaps EW could do better? |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|d|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|jtr: Ah one more round of musical chairs it seems:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jtr: 2NT should deny 4@ss here|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|xenya: some would happily bid 3@C as W third in hand -- might have made things more difficult for NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c8|nt|jtr: They must play it as better since it looks classic to me|pg||
nt|jtr: Spec points out that declarer may misguess @ds when West has 7 @cs|pg||
nt|xenya: Martin, could you tell us which Herbst is N and which is S? |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jtr: I think Ilan plays North|pg||
nt|jtr: Wrong again:)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|vugraphzkj: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Must be the Danish (Monrad) format where two teams can meet 1 million times. Always 1st against 2nd|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jtr: They call it German Roland  (Or Bonn actually)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room, W did open 3@C, which effectively stopped NS reaching game |pg||
nt|Walddk6: So they stole it from us|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|Walddk6: J.H. Monrad, Danish engineer, devised it in 1928 for chess|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe he emigrated?|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Yes, some Danes do|pg||
nt|jtr: Another spec says that the @sA and @hK should be marked so declarer can play those suits first|pg||
nt|jtr: Some jump over Germany:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Low @h now say|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Fly over in my case|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah 5 losers yes|pg||
nt|jtr: Jumping avoids dust clouds|pg||
nt|jtr: I am more interested in Danish migration than this hand sorry:)|pg||
nt|jtr: If he plays a @h and then a @s he loses 5 tricks|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe an immediate @d discard might have been best|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jtr: After all, a top player like Salvo would never throw one from xxx:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Ergo he has Jxxxx|pg||
nt|xenya: tough for declarer to get @Ds right in any case -- unless he manages to get some sort of count of the EW hands|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, as a spec points out there is the undertrick consideration too|pg||
nt|jtr: 5 down possibly|pg||
nt|jtr: That changes the odds dramatically|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe it is worth risking a low @h now|pg||
nt|xenya: as a spectator points out, the two spade discards by E may be an indication to his shape |pg||
nt|jtr: May get more information assuming East has the K|pg||
nt|jtr: Could have AQ87|pg||
nt|xenya: it is probably E who has the @HK, sytill |pg||
nt|xenya: still the undertrick issue... |pg||
nt|jtr: Well, 'only' 3 down if West has the King:)|pg||
nt|xenya: i think i would risk a herat now|pg||
nt|jtr: A Herbst?:)|pg||

nt|vugraphzkk: Hello Gábor, hello Roland!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: hello Lukas|pg||
mb|3C|nt|cicus: will N X 3@C or bid 3NT?|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: ty for german lesson,  I needed it..|pg||
nt|cicus: I'd X|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 22/18 and basicly disappointmenr altho void @d|pg||
nt|mcarroll: me too|pg||
mb|3D|nt|h_karluk: *disappointment|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: could count as another brave recognizition by S and W|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: dont hesitate to ask, if you have any questions :)|pg||
nt|xenya: almost classic 3@H by W   |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: hear 3@D then 3N?|pg||
nt|cicus: no, then pass|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cicus: few @Ds and only a single stopper makes 3NT unattractive|pg||
nt|cicus: let alone some missing HCP's|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: this stage of declarer play is MOST important: the planning|pg||
nt|cicus: now W can take a ruff but the losing @C can be discarded on the 4th spade later|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: can he guess, that @s3 is a single?|pg||
nt|caitlin: I also would not bid 3N, but wondered if North would|pg||
pc|sK|nt|h_karluk: x and xx , don't ask me i am new at the town:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: well judged auction - making plus 1 probably |pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: allright xx removed|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Losing 2 @H and a @C|pg||
nt|mcarroll: meanwhile, this 3NT does not look like making|pg||
nt|sybarra: "we" might be a trick or so short here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 26 hcp but with @S lead, this contract does not make.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|xenya: should not be difficult to guess @Ds i think...|pg||
nt|caitlin: seems right to me to play low|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: not sure much makes on the 3 level |pg||
nt|xenya: wrong!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|h_karluk: which is fine as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: i just wanted to shock you ;-)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: always difficult, when you have no long suits to use|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|nt|h_karluk: teehee, Lukas merci for poor hamdi:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *mercy|pg||
nt|mcarroll: needda to be careful not to block the@Ss|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the minor suits nmot friendly either |pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: i think its not so difficult to see :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W can see and count 12 cards in @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|mcarroll: true my fault for trying to multi-task, trying to keep an eye on Monaco qualifying|pg||
nt|cicus: E could have played a small @S here but it does not help as he has only 1 @C|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s9|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: you know another busy week on BBO vugraph theatre, anyways nice humorous approaches are always inside crew, cool:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: yes, for me it was also very busy in the last few days... but i like the job, its also a lot of fun :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2nd double could be optional <on some rare CC> as they knew spades their suit|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's great, i cannot wait my shift ends to have a cold beer :P|pg||
nt|cicus: now S must resist the temptation to take a fnesse against @DJ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: maybe it was not so easy after all |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: likely to try club hook and go down quikly |pg||
nt|jcmax: Hmmm. is it just a 1-day tournament?|pg||
nt|jcmax: sry folks...|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Sabine,  you are always welcome |pg||
nt|rnmalik: It was -1 and now in an effort to make it would be -2.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: no this Tournament goes from Friday till Sunday|pg||
nt|sybarra: from earlier explanation I saw,  the round robin, moves folks up and down the ranks|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: many Teams, who played the Bonn Nations Cup at Wednesday/Thursday stayed here to play the German Trophy too|pg||
pc|d6|nt|h_karluk: 1st doubles are mostly t/o|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: Round Robin was just at the beginning of the Tournament, now they play Swiss System|pg||
nt|rnmalik: So by the end of the day we have 4 top teams. Am I right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: they play in 3 groups, and always after some rounds there come 2/3 teams into the lower group/better group|pg||
nt|caitlin: if he does, he is definitely down|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: now he is reading in the convention card, maybe it helps for his decission...|pg||
nt|caitlin: or count on hand but hard to know if third seat 3@C is 6 or 7 card suit|pg||
nt|cicus: west may be 1327|pg||
pc|dT|nt|h_karluk: unless they start with a level more than 4|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|caitlin: a clue is that East did not return club, trying to set one up|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: now he needs to get hearts right to limit the losses|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|sfoxa:  Is Hungarian "Winkiboy" named after their lead - Winkler? I suppose|pg||
nt|xenya: so 3@H was makeable|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not like the 2 @S bid,  (not resulting hand) but seems a bit much |pg||
nt|caitlin: oh well, understandable from declarer's point of view|pg||
nt|cicus: I can't say this was not percentage play, although what if west has only 6 clubs?|pg||
nt|cicus: is that prohibited when vulnerable?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|cicus: of course in that case E made a defensive error by not returning a small spade instead of cashing !ge Queen|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|caitlin: not at all but seems East would have sent through club, trying to set up second trick, which he could do with ONE or TWO|pg||
pc|s7|pc|cT|nt|xenya: S has opened -- is there room for the @HQ in the N hand?|pg||

mb|2N|nt|sfoxa:  and that looks like partscore, rather for EW |pg||
nt|cicus: sry no, if E switches to clubs it goes down|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  but let's see|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: and then West switches back to @Ds|pg||
nt|cicus: tough defence, though|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mcarroll: I think at least 1 down|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  they manage to find better fit|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: and the club lead will not hurt declarer |pg||
nt|sybarra: or can N find another lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: 4@h seems to be possible|pg||
nt|xenya: a disheartening start for Israel|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H makeable but many ifs and buts-good stop anyway.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mcarroll: Sorry forgot auction did not finish with 1NT|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: 4@s = no major|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sfoxa:  still, you are right - at least 1 down, rather 2 )))|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And unfortunately they managed to overcook the auction, the 3 level was best|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: one down also in 4@c...|pg||
pc|h9|nt|friggi: hi all|pg||

nt|caitlin: interesting that board 10, 3@D down here, open room N-S in 3N with very different bidding 1Nby North 2C by South and clubs doubled by West rather than 3C opener...weak notrump by ...|pg||
nt|caitlin: North|pg||
pc|c5|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: *1@s, sorry|pg||
nt|cicus: with @SA, @S finesse, then @D finesse and clearing @Ds this can be made|pg||
nt|cicus: I can see nothing more to play for|pg||
pc|c3|nt|caitlin: nor I...seems like 'normal' bridge play:)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: if Pard was going to pickle my @H trick why not lead it  (says S)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Such friendly defense:)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cicus: W found another plan: Hx in clubs with N|pg||
nt|cicus: however, this brings in 3 club tricks only if the x is te 9|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  agree with -1, yes|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hm essentially finessing against the (9 of trrump|pg||

mb|p|nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|friggi: that is more like it:)|pg||

nt|xenya: but he also has 3 hearts in support for partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl2: we had some problems with connections or so, now we're back:)|pg||
nt|cicus: 3@S must be a transfer to 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jtr: 3NT needs some work|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i admit was indeed disciplined as David wisely pointed out|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe that accounts for it? |pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: yes|pg||
nt|cicus: then they probably play 3NT rsponse as some self-dangerous artificial bid :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sfoxa:  S is happy to show both - maximum overcall and @h with his DBL|pg||
pc|sK|nt|h_karluk: maybe with little defense, we ll see|pg||
nt|jtr: I am sure Salvo will find a way|pg||
nt|h_karluk: is he a magician, i thought i am alone:)|pg||
nt|jtr: @d to the 7 at trick 2 i guess|pg||

nt|vugraphzkk: forgetting one pass makes everybody confused :-D|pg||
nt|friggi: yes 2NT should be 23-24|pg||

pc|dT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|sybarra: just a bit messier |pg||
nt|friggi: like 3NT better|pg||
nt|cicus: S has to return @Ds to cut dummy off its @S10|pg||
nt|cicus: @S9  , I mean|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|xenya: i wish i knew the meaning of all those bids, but the final contract is almost perfect |pg||
nt|xenya: 4@S was a fair alternative of course|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mcarroll: But as it turns out, @D play better, the 4-1 @H split would make a @H contract at the 3 level a major problem|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes but given the 4/4 fit at the table we probably all select 4 @H |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|friggi: truth but that bidding is overrated given that you miss a lot of Aces:)|pg||

nt|vugraphzkk: he explained after the 3@c bid, so then it was clear with the @c's...|pg||

pc|c9|nt|h_karluk: two pass and 3@h . hmm :) bothvul|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jtr: Yes but what will be the effect on our flights?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I ll bid what i think"|pg||

nt|h_karluk: I guess Zorlu thought " I|pg||
nt|cicus: of course, W will not discard any more major suit card|pg||
pc|h3|nt|h_karluk: i thought it wuz over sir|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah so maybe just no major initially|pg||
nt|jtr: Over me yes:)|pg||

nt|jtr: But with all those entries he wisely led high|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|xenya: right, looks like a normal result |pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: Some play 4@h is the principle of fast arrival but i think that is wrong|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: 4@H must be the weakest bid in this sequence|pg||
nt|jtr: if 3@c is game forcing then 3@h followed by 4@h can be the weakest option|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@h should be a 'picture' bid|pg||

nt|vugraphzkk: thanks too|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  for Bonn Nationa Cup, there were on-line scores. and what about this tournamnet?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: there are also online scores|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 2@d multy here|pg||
nt|xenya: somewhat unexpectedly, the match is almost even -- it did look as though Winkiboy had an upper hand |pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|cicus: so a useful win for Turkey|pg||
mb|2N|an|!h+!c|nt|jtr: A wild one too|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/bgt_2010/10_05_14_wer.html - these ones, t.y.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: yes|pg||
mb|3D|nt|yuval10: they missed chances in board 4 and 5|pg||
nt|cicus: this board is not going to alter the result|pg||
nt|cicus: N has a 3@H bid in my opinion|pg||
nt|cicus: and S will carry on to game|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: well, i think board 14 will bring some IMPs for Israel|pg||
nt|cicus: N has to filler cards|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: and this is easy |pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: 2@h is more often 5 than 6 cards...|pg||
nt|yuval10: both should've been a pickup for Winklboy team and turned into minus|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  seems they also use transfers after 1@C-x|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|cicus: two*|pg||
mb|4D|nt|caitlin: obviously 2N here is hearts and minor|pg||
nt|cicus: S is overbidding now|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|cicus: as 3@H was not forcing, he should have settled for game|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: 2NT = @h+@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkk: but sometimes it doesnt work :(|pg||
nt|caitlin: ty|pg||
mb|4H|nt|tomi2:  that 4333 8 count with no king and ace and no heart stopper wouldnt be my favorite hand for 1nt facing a partner who could be "light on classic shape"|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: u know sometimz ur feelings whisper smthng, like left shoulder buddy tells go that, but righty stops..and when th board over u confess " th evil made me do it" lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: absolutelty a wild one, fortunately exotic flowers do not bloom very often|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|nt|mcarroll: Open Room is slowere than here, but all the scores so far have beento the Hungarian team|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: last board for this round|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and 3NT should make|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: seems, that Hungary will win this fight...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Declarer has 2@H, 3@S 3 minor tricks and N will be endplayed to give the 9th|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Drew,  great point on the previous hand |pg||
pc|sK|nt|h_karluk: appreciated Lukas& David - hey i wont pay say your hairs became more white bcoz of me..lol |pg||

pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rnmalik: would you prefer 2NT by E for shape or feature etc as per their agreement. Would make 6.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: thx to Lukas our terrific operator |pg||
nt|xenya: now this is a really good lesson never get disheartened by a bad result: your counterparts in the other room may do equally badly|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
mc|12|nt|cicus: yes, Lukas, bd 14 may bring in a handful of IMPs for Israel, if they can cope with the hand|pg||
nt|cicus: let's have  alook at the other room, bye everyone|pg||
