mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|d!|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: a bit uncomfortable for Brogeland?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: very uncomfortable|pg||
pc|c7|nt|flash: X would be t/o and the last thing he wants to hear is partner pulling to 4@C|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|chorush: 4 spades might make for NS becasue clubs are 3-3 and spades 3-2|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i would think that a neg dbl here shows both majors so n should have bid 3s|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|flash: welcome to George Mittelman|pg||
nt|jcmax: hi George|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c3|pg||

pc|d7|nt|jcmax: If N had bid 3@S surely s would bid 4, wouldn't he? can that make?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|flash: 200 for N-S will limit the damage|pg||
nt|flash: if not gain IMPs|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|flash: the 'modern game' opens the North hand; Alvin and Tobias are not pleased|pg||
nt|jcmax: Everything was very friendly, though. @S 3-2 and @C 3-3|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|chorush: yes, certainly 4S was not high percentage|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mittmouse: just a h guess to make 3nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: There are 8 tricks on top and for the 9th declarer will need to guess 1H|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|jcmax: That is if they lead a 1S, which looks normal :)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|c9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|flash: the Jack was Rusinow - lower of touching honors|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcmax: Declarer can run the @C first safely. Maybe there will be some telling discards|pg||

nt|flash: from Passell's defense, i wonder if their agreements didn't include Rusinow/ coded Ts and 9s|pg||

Otherwise W would know declarer has 8 tricks on top and there could be no point in going up with the @HA and shift to a @D with J10xx in dummy|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mittmouse: passells upgraded 1nt makes it easy to get to game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s4|nt|flash: if one counts the tens as 1/2 HCP each, it's not even an upgrade??   (and we've seen far more extreme cases)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|jcmax: I wonder whether the @S8 carries some smith signal inferences|pg||
nt|chorush: Brogland has to consider that his partner could have Axx of hearts|pg||
nt|chorush: Yes Sabine, especially if they are playng some sort of smith|pg||
nt|flash: Smith Echo (and the reverse version) use the sequence of plays in the suit declarer first attacks as indicating the strength of the holding in the defense's first-led suit|pg||
nt|jcmax: S doesn't know from the lead whether partner has 4 or 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|jcmax: if he has 5, it could very well be right to continue @D|pg||
nt|jcmax: If he has only 4, the only chance seems to be, partner has Axx in 1H|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|flash: again, for security reasons, both tables will close briefly between rounds |pg||

pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s9|nt|po-s: now show.up squeeze|pg||
mc|9|nt|chorush: if his partner had 5 diamonds, the declarer opened 1NT with 2 doubletons|pg||
nt|flash: back soonest|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i have a rule where i will never upgrade 14 unless i have 2 aces u need aces to make 3nt|pg||
