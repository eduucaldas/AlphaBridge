nt|ahollan1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   lets you spy on the other room, where you would have seen the auction  1@D-DBL-2@D-2@S//5@D-6@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: By bidding the way he did, Zhao has shown a hand that can take 10 tricks opposite virtually nothing|pg||

nt|petergill: Regarding Bd 7, AKxxxx (or AKxxx) is such a good "side suit" that 2@D with less trumps is a more promising contract than 2@H - having most of the Q-J-10-9 cards in your trump suit ...|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Weinstein has no defence against this. Unlucky lead|pg||
nt|petergill: The meaning of South's opening has helped EW know to stay low, knowing that spades are breaking 4-2 and helping East to play double dummy. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: With trump length and a suit as good as this you normally do not lead a singleton, but it would have been better here|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: and the lead helped to count out the rest of the hand|pg||

nt|petergill: At Trick 1, South could be placed with a singleton club - 4@S, 5 @H from the bidding, 3@D from Trick 1, and thus only one club - hence the club finesse, with 6/7 chance of winning|pg||
