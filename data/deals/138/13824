mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: I am referring to EW|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Dbl = pure take-out|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: this decision will be costly for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too tough for East to pass out 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same thing happened at other table, and i'm sure will happen at many more|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: I passed faster than Piekarek did|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|petergill: Some will pass out 4@H, and a few will think South's hand is too strong for a 4@H opener, but this will probably be the most common auction|pg||
nt|dburn:  I guess so, but there were more bad things than one could happen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: smirnov aged a bit -- then rejuvenated seeing dummy|pg||

nt|vugraphzjf: Players save time whenever they can|pg||

mb|1H|nt|petergill: Last round I provided one recent interview (partly) about Canadians like Hampson moving to America. Here's another good interview, a 2010 interview with Fred Gitelman ...|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N, 2N or trap pass??|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: trap pass is not an issue|pg||
mb|2N|an|after some thought|nt|petergill: Scoring is cross imps. 46 pairs, so 22 comparisons, so divide EW's lead by 22 to calculate their lead in real IMPs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|an|quickly|nt|ahollan1: see --- there was a problem :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Piekarek already had  his lead out before the screen ever came back|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|vugraphzjf: tray Imean|pg||
nt|petergill: Overnight scores at http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/2010/SATBULL2010.pdf with EW leading by about 30 real IMPS, and NS 7th overnight|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Next round we have Greco hampson  Multon Zimmermann|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H6 is not a misclick  leads are 2nd/4th|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: i dont misclick|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT should make 8 tricks - almost all lines lead to 8 tricks. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: I play the cards I want the audience to see:)0|pg||

pc|sK|nt|petergill: I think North was of Polish origin before he moved to Germany - Polish leads are 2nd and 4th|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sT|nt|petergill: Two of my Euroepan friends regard NS as the strognest pair in Germaony'|pg||
nt|petergill: in Germany's open team |pg||
pc|d3|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: @H5  upside down count/attitude [you decide which]|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, if you are friends with Piekarek and Smirnov, that would make sense|pg||
nt|davidstern: And Smirnov's win in the Australian South West Pacific Teams and Second in the National Open Teams playing with a youth team would cinfirm that view|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Wrang asking about the leads|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Specifically from 3|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c7|nt|petergill: North will probably get off lead in clubs, then when West finds South with 35x4 shape, he will claim on the diamond finesse, as x =1|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|dburn:  to clarify: "2nd/4th" means that you lead fourth best from four or more cards, 2nd best from three or fewer|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c9|pc|d2|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|dburn:  which means that you lead middle from three and low from two|pg||
pc|hK|mc|8|nt|ahollan1: right the biggest clarification for most is lead SMALL from a worthless doubleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Norths hand counted out so finesse a sure thing|pg||

mb|1H|nt|dburn:  this is to be distinguished from "4th and 2nd", which means that you lead fourth best from suits headed by an honor, 2nd best from bad suits, and high from a doubleton|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|petergill: The Auction results here, with Pierre Zimmermann buying NS for $10,000 more than he paid for Wladow - Elinescu, indicates that Zimmermann also thinks highly of NS. Ref ...|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Piekarek asks to see the trick again|pg||
nt|petergill: 2nd and 4th allowed South to duck @H8 in complete safety|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4th best = Rule of 11, 3rd best = Rule of 12  so 2nd best = Rule of 13|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Dummy Dekniff lowers the screen to remind North he won the trick|pg||

nt|dburn:  which carried to its logical conclusion means that if anyone leads a singleton, the suit may appear to contain anything from 10 to 17 cards|pg||
