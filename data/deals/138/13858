pc|sA|nt|jbgood: 4 level a tad too high|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is just a normal 1 down, diamond ruff or not|pg||

nt|barnets: of 15  partnerships containing leading US players in 8 the player is not playing with,his regular partner, there still remains 7 strong US partnerships|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, there is a slight risk that EW will get too high|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: Levin in 2@S on 22|pg||
mb|1S|nt|barnets: this is for the specs who have commentated on this aspect|pg||
nt|henryb:  Levin-Weinstein bought the hand for 2â |pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: 3NT now, let's get it over with|pg||
nt|dburn: North-South appear to be a bit high at the moment|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: but no one can ever double anything for penalty any more|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes David, but as you well know, penelty doubles do not exist below 7@D|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: penalty even|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
nt|jbgood: this is surely a very atypical 1@s from Helgemo|pg||
nt|henryb:  If you don't play penalty doubles you give the opponents license to bid on hands like South's|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would double of 2@S be penalty for you, Henry, when you're sitting under the suit?|pg||
nt|po-s: it makes if declarer plays AK of hearts but may guess to go for other possibilities|pg||
nt|henryb:  on this start, yes|pg||
pc|h7|nt|po-s: what other start did you think of?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: of course most East players will respond 1@S  [or 1@H transfer]|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|barnets: well clubs would work as well|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|barnets: thats 9|pg||
pc|s8|nt|barnets: or 10|pg||
nt|henryb:  and the @h drop will be 10|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|barnets: actually|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|2S|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|dburn: not clear for West to bid again with those cards|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|dburn: but no great harm will befall her - she might even make four|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I don't think Larry Cohen would approve|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, had she been able to double two spades for penalty, she would have done rather better|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|dburn: but this is the so-called 21st century|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only 5@H, no singleton|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@H is makeable on the lie of the cards and the bidding |pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if alert of 2@H is constructive -- why wouldn't DBL be PEN?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|hT|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: lots of room for other game tries|pg||

mc|10|nt|ahollan1: Weinstein 2@S south|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: closing and will reboot for the last round of the 2010 Cavendish Pairs.  Would like to thank BBO and the Cavendish for allowing us to bring you this event for all BridgePlayers|pg||
