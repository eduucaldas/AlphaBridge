mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|flash: likely a battle of French Std systems|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3S|nt|jcmax: Can N content himself with 2@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c6|nt|jcmax: He couldn't and it seems pretty tough to me to do that. The hand could very easily be a double fit|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|flash: as it turns out, there is a double fit; just 4 top losers in the roundeds (and an eventual trump loser)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|jcmax: At the other table actually N overcalled 1@D over 1@C. let's see how high  that gts them! .)|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: regular (not Puppet) Stayman and expected conclusion|pg||
nt|jcmax: I would be surprised if anyone in the room arrived anywhere else|pg||
pc|s3|nt|flash: good hand to stretch; re-fill coffee cup (or wine glass)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jcmax: The technicla play in the @H-suit for 4 tricks would be a low @H to the J|pg||
nt|flash: 2-way finesse in @Hs, but with few dummy entries, looks normal to lose to the dblton Q?|pg||
nt|jcmax: But on this hand declarer has no convenient entry to dummy to do that|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|jcmax: Alternatively to pick up the doubleton Q with W declarer can play @HA and a low @H. but once again he needs a dummy entry to get to the 4th @H if he was right|pg||
nt|fokal: endplay for the ninth trick|pg||
nt|flash: note the bonus for having played the 2nd round of @Ss|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|flash: bienvenue a un autre Bessis  :)|pg||
nt|fokal: could still go down with the k of @c off side and AK of @d in w seat but he took more chances|pg||
nt|fokal: hi all|pg||
nt|fokal: :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: A very famous bridge playing family indeed! The mother is actually playing int the Frenach trials for the europena championships this weekend. How is she doing?|pg||
nt|jcmax: Lots of French supporters here. she is +70 with 40 boards left I am told :)|pg||
nt|fokal: actually M.Bessis could have played @c|pg||
nt|fokal: if south play small W take the king and kill the dummy entry by playing a club|pg||
nt|fokal: M.BESSIS is Michel the father|pg||
nt|fokal: Thomas is my brother|pg||
nt|fokal: by playing a @h sry|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|d7|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|h8|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jcmax: So what you are saying is that E would have done best switching to a low@C trying to bersuade declarer he had the K?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|jcmax: That would have been magic indeed :)|pg||

qx|o6|st||md|4ST83HQJ632DA654C3,SK6HDKT8732CKJ642,SA52HK985DQJCT975,SQJ974HAT74D9CAQ8|sv|e|nt|fokal: yes it could have given trouble to declarer|pg||
nt|flash: last board of the round; again, for security reasons, both tables will close briefly between rounds|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|fokal: that's why I though declarer would have played J of @h instead of A of @h and j of @h. |pg||
nt|fokal: Then the endplay doesn't work but he 'll have more leverage|pg||
nt|fokal: even on the @c then @h defense declarer can probably manage to win since defence will give him his ninth tricks eventually|pg||
nt|jcmax: Thomas may be very reluctant to pass 3N here. His 3@C bid didn't even show @C. It was just 4th suit forcing|pg||
nt|jcmax: So he knows his partner has no clue he has such a distributional hand|pg||
nt|fokal: yes they play 2@s forcing in this bidding auction|pg||
nt|fokal: but showing 3 card support (at least)|pg||
nt|fokal: and they don't play yet 2NT as forcing |pg||
nt|fokal: (but working about it)|pg||
nt|jcmax: :)|pg||
nt|fokal: after 1@s 2 @c 2@h|pg||
nt|flash: if he pulls, might he choose 4@S, since he's already denied 3-card support?|pg||
nt|jcmax: Olivier, does anyone in France play 2/1 GF?|pg||
nt|fokal: so 3@c doesn't show anything special|pg||
nt|fokal: more and more|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fokal: but even if it's the case for some pairs they won't play the same rebid as in the US|pg||
pc|h3|nt|flash: moot question...  |pg||
nt|flash: (mine, that is - Sabine's is quite pertinent  :))|pg||
nt|jcmax: S did very well to find the @H lead here|pg||
nt|fokal: yes he could have bid 4@s and indeed it seems a better contract|pg||
pc|d2|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|flash: almost anything is better than down 2 off the top?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jcmax: On any other lead declarer could have made his contract very easily by playing for 1S to be 3-3|pg||
nt|fokal: true :)|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d7|pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d8|nt|flash: the @H9 was needed there; and Quantin plays his partner to hold the 8|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
