nt|kareno: Expensive!|pg||
nt|flash: 3 Norwegians and a Pole who lived there a bit and has since moved on to England|pg||
nt|flash: i'm waiting for the Norwegians to show up at an NABC in the Norwegian Mens Curling Team pants...|pg||
nt|jcmax: I wonder what language they will speak at the table. malinowski is fluent in Norwegian :)|pg||
nt|flash: seems only fair...|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: ok so there was one card in the floor when the players came in|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: director thought it was from the last rd|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|kareno: Good they found it!  |pg||

pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|kareno: Slim and none!|pg||
nt|jcmax: It seems the only realistic chance is the @D finesse and @C QJ doubleton|pg||
mc|8|nt|flash: for those who missed the spectacle, the pants in question were a very loud ARGHHHHyle|pg||
nt|jcmax: And declarer was starting to play for that|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: director was here in case the extra information was used|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: it didnt matter|pg||

nt|chorush: I would think so based on the bidding|pg||

mb|p|mb|r!|mb|p|nt|dburn:  chicken time|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  mind you, West did pass as dealer|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|jcmax: Note that E may not have been able to bid 2@S immediately without the redouble. For many pairs that would carry the implication of a 1D-fit and the desire to compete|pg||
nt|kareno: That double of 2@d not my idea of a good thing.  Happily east has a place to run.|pg||
nt|dburn:  could be important to get a diamond lead, but unclear - if partner wanted to lead a spade against 3NT, I would not be keen to tell him not to|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|kareno: The redouble was systemic and no, folks, I would not pass 2@d doubled.  Most days you can make them pay for those sketchy doubles.|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|dburn:  good decision by Brogeland, who was rightly afraid of spades when Malinowski could not double 2@s|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|dburn:  won't pick up all that many IMPs, since 2NT won't make either, but still...|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|flash: it looks as though Helness could afford to split his honors in @H, since North denied 3-card length??|pg||
nt|dburn:  he could, but declarer was not going to stick in the nine|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d3|pc|sT|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s9|nt|flash: but declarer certainly wouldn't risk a finesse |pg||
pc|c2|pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
pc|s7|pc|dT|mc|7|nt|vugraphzje: we will be back soon with the last rd of this session and standings with one rd to go|pg||
