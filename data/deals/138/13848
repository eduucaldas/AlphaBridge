mb|2S|mb|p|nt|fokal: hi everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi Olivier|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: no is 41|pg||
nt|fokal: does someone know the current ranking ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: congrats to your dad/brother Oliver|pg||
nt|fokal: thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|fokal: (my mum just qualified in french women team ) :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/2010/PAIRS5O.htm   no updates until this session finished|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Helgemo-Helness  1   and  Levin-Weinstein  2   will be on vugraph the entire day|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: 3 father-son pairs playing the event  Blanchard, Lall and Bessis [who's Zimmermann team demolished the Swiss field]|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Helness' double was understandable. Unfortunately Helgemo had a useless shape |pg||
nt|jbgood: not an easy contract to play on the moysian fit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Weinstein sat for the double in the other room on a slightly different auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would you all have at IMPs?|pg||
nt|barnets: its close|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/    let's you spy on the other table|pg||
nt|fokal: I think the aim should be to try to make 8 tricks, even if it means ruffing with the long hand|pg||
pc|c2|pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: we've already mentioned, Weinstein IS a gambler |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jbgood: i think Geir knows what is right - take out a t-o double|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
nt|jbgood: pays well in the long run - unless your trumps are really good|pg||
nt|barnets: thats what edgar kaplan used to say  in his commentaries|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jbgood: he was never wroasng|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|jbgood: wrong :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzjf: South is Shane|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d8|nt|barnets: i think the play will go faster in 2@S than 2@HX but you never know|pg||
nt|jbgood: Will make for 110 (or maybe even 140)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d4|nt|vugraphzjf: North is leaning back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: webcam picture on right show Geir Helgemo [L] and Robert Blanchard [R]|pg||
nt|Walddk2: -670 for L-W will be even better news for H&H|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: picture from the other table Steve Weinstein [L] and Curtis Cheek [R]|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That will be a very expensive board when compared to 22 other results|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Bob is shaking his head|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s4|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is why we're wearing/recommending seat belts and crash helmets|pg||

mb|1N|mb|2H!|mb|3H|nt|jbgood: a big swing compared to Weinstein - Levin|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: 3@H not typical Lebensohl bid|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We just passed the half-way point. 27 boards altogether|pg||
nt|barnets: with diamonds dividing 4-4 this is a lucky make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but clever how it convinced Blanchards to hold 44 @D|pg||
nt|jbgood: not many typical Leb bids around any more, Al|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Results will be up very soon after the last board has been played. They are using Bridgemates|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: ten minutes left|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No running scores due to security issues|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but it doesn't even look like Rubensohl [transfer lebensohl]|pg||
nt|barnets: had South 5 diamonds many play  count plays on the opening lead eg|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The same reason why Debbie has to shut down after each round of 3 boards|pg||
nt|barnets: the king asks for count|pg||
nt|jbgood: at the other table in the same contract and the same lead, Grue shiftet to a spade at trick two|pg||
nt|barnets: then north could show 3|pg||
nt|barnets: and south would know the Q was doubleton and cash out|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: ahhh John Gowdy suggests  it IS leb -- but Helgemo willing to play Moysian @S|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: i.e.  Stayman without a @H stop|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: tor is placing his top high cards on table|pg||
mc|10|pg||

mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: Anyone for double with Helness' cards to show the unbids suits and club tolerance?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: slow  pass by Geir |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: not me Roland|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I like it, but it is soooooo close|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|barnets: declarer has to lose just 1 heart trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wouldn't object to 3@C either|pg||
nt|barnets: HE can do that by playing 2 high trumps|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h6|nt|barnets: ruffng a club in hand|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|nt|barnets: and leading a low heart to the Q|pg||
nt|jbgood: the slow pass was surely because Geir was thinking of 4 NT to show his second minor, but decided not to "save"|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: He would have if Tor had doubled|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin bid 3@C in completely different context   1@C[strong]-2@C-DBL[5-7]-3@C|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|d2|pc|s4|pg||
