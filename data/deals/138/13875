nt|sunsamvar: yes and few losers if fit is found|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: N must be thinking now given the 3 @D bid |pg||
mb|5D|nt|fabsayc: but reversing does not leave options, you can show playing strength latter if a fit found|pg||

mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: i wd open a 8 point 6-5 ... this is much stronger :)|pg||
