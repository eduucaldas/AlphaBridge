mb|p|nt|yuval10: E seem likely to overcall now|pg||
nt|ludewig: ok who shows Majors with Easts hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With 6-4 (bad 4) I think it's best to treat it as a one-suiter|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2H!|an|!ds,limit or better|mb|p|nt|ludewig: now he has a very good hand|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|yuval10: 3@d is a very good bid|pg||
nt|ludewig: yes, Club-K is worthless but the rest is very good|pg||
nt|yuval10: now W knows to evaluate his points - K@c is waisted and A@d, K@S are very good|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: alerted from west, and in the tank now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Say West is 3-3 or even 2-3 in the majors? What would he choose then? Hearts, and that is not the best spot|pg||
nt|yuval10: unless E had a 2@s bid in mind over 2@h, which we don't know|pg||
nt|caitlin: seems to me East should show a one suiter |pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho: I would feel very comfortable at the table after 4@h = |pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  not impossible after E sold his two-suiter |pg||

mb|p|nt|yuval10: NS should still manage to reach their making game|pg||
nt|yuval10: S considering Pass or 3NT i believe|pg||
nt|ludewig: 3 down doubled is not bad either|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: 2@H is weaker bid whereas 2@S would show more values by West in case East has hearts|pg||

nt|caitlin: strange that the X can't be takeout|pg||
nt|po-s: heart to king and run the spade 7?|pg||
nt|caitlin: that makes sense Bernard|pg||
nt|riccho: good question... |pg||

nt|caitlin: with those hearts?|pg||
nt|yuval10: same bidding in the CR but N decided to bid 3@s|pg||
nt|ludewig: depending on what Souths double means|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: alerted as showing @hs or any strong hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: instead of X|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's takeout in the sense that they can't both have hearts when East has at least 6|pg||
nt|caitlin: other room N-S made 3N|pg||
nt|yuval10: the Israeli team playing in this event is the team who will represent Israel in the European Championship in Ostende, Belgium next month|pg||
nt|ludewig: it is usually a good idea to force the opener to show his long suit and X is the best way|pg||
nt|yuval10: consist of the 2 pairs playing and Ginossar-Pachtman|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: a kib asked me: what do u think about that multi? |pg||
nt|caitlin: more points in diamonds than hearts:)|pg||
nt|ludewig: OK for me, AK is a lot but 6 cards and NV you can't pass|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1st hand white vs red.... i think the majority of the players will open it|pg||
nt|caitlin: same multi at other table.....typical multi|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Perfectly normal at these colours|pg||
nt|caitlin: so Roland what would you expect for a vulnerable multi?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A better suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he is NV|pg||
nt|ludewig: West is still considering running this to his hand|pg||
nt|ludewig: after Souths Diamond Jack earlier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you keep waiting for the ideal hand, you may have to wait until the end of time|pg||
pc|s4|nt|po-s: small is really bad but king, then heart to ace, diamond,diamond is also quite costly|pg||
nt|riccho: the biggest advantage of strong @c systems is the possibility to open light|pg||

nt|Walddk2: In about 25 minutes|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Neth vs Germany (women's series)|pg||

nt|caitlin: womens' teams all bunched up|pg||

nt|pelu: as u see S was "squeezed" to discard a @h|pg||
nt|mcarroll: as my grandmother used to sy - the only chance is the best chance|pg||
nt|h_karluk: jaja:)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mcarroll: Flannery?|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 1@s seems lesser evil|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mcarroll: Roland's favourite convention|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we are in luck, Roland is busy a lot|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 5@H, 4@S 11 -15|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if only point were divided 20 to 20 as well )))|pg||
mb|d|nt|h_karluk: time for a splinter?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh bergenish|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@c = Bergen|pg||
nt|mdgraham: always easier when you see all the hands, though ;)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  time for vulnerable EW game and (possible) NS save|pg||
mb|2S|nt|h_karluk: however that doesn't mean a sudden thunderstorm not occurs :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what a wide range, 6-12|pg||
mb|3H|nt|pelu: 6-12 is a wide range, I prefer 3@C = 10-12, and 3@D = 7-9|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS have double red fit and some points|pg||
mb|4S|nt|h_karluk: 3D normal in my book, anyways not sure abt 4D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4NT from South, one suspects|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless Norht gets there first |pg||
nt|ludewig: he is thinking about it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, after partner's free bid |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Q - would 5@d from South show longer diamonds?|pg||
nt|ludewig: and West might take the push to 5 Spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: agreed Peter, that was the way we played on OKB 97-2000|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now S is limited by his partner pause (((|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not necessarily - screens?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|h_karluk: @c 5 ??|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a deception try|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  indeed - I forgot it|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|pelu: I like A'es - but not @DA here :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|h_karluk: worked|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|ludewig: 5@d looks nomal to me, should show longer diamonds than hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: me too|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with red kings, E must be happy to dbl it|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pelu: wow|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I prefer 3@C = 6-9 and 3@D =10-11 - easier to remember for me anyway|pg||
nt|h_karluk: don't push - just try to hide one on yr sleeve:p|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so we all dislike that wide range|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True Hamdi|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ludewig: 4 Imps if down 500|pg||
nt|ludewig: and 8 if 300|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If there was any slowness about the screen coming through, South can infer that it was North who was thinking. It was unlikely to have been West. So maybe there could be some ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ethical constraints. Even so, South has a reasonable 5@D bid.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: finesse and ruff|pg||
nt|pelu: they Play 1M - 3@D = 11-12 and 3 card support|pg||
pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: but still D A entry|pg||
pc|h9|nt|h_karluk: 7-9 fine with me|pg||
nt|pelu: they need some special bids when they open 9+ HCP|pg||
nt|h_karluk: obv|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Sorry, East|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: same story|pg||
pc|h4|nt|h_karluk: or pattern, whatever|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: gl to em|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sfoxa:  well defended, indeed!|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ludewig: 300 and 8 Imps to Israel|pg||
mc|9|nt|vugraphzkk: TD here...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: (To several viewers) the TD might well be called, but we cannot attribute hesitations, as the operator does not always operate in "real time" - he enters the bids in pairs when ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they come throught he screen |pg||
nt|ludewig: North did think a very long time it seems |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Indeed. But 5@D seems ok, given the spade length.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: yes, it was really a longer time for me...|pg||
nt|ludewig: obviously it is not East who has been thinking|pg||
nt|ludewig: I t5hink S has a clear cut bid NV against V|pg||

nt|vugraphzkm: hi all|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi Paul|pg||
nt|caitlin: For the first time this event includes womens' teams and they are running very close.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|vugraphzkm: for those , who are curious: the last match of the day will be Germany vs. Netherlands (Women)|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho: anyone dbl here?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|caitlin: great|pg||
nt|yuval10: very good match also|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Bernard Ludewig|pg||
nt|ludewig: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: knew u will like this match, Yuval :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'd bid 2@h from S, if i have some ways to show a "better" raise, like 2@d|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sfoxa:  i vote for dbl with N hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  4-3 majors|pg||
nt|riccho: this might get an expensive adventure|pg||
nt|riccho: I agree with disliking 1NT anyway :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: right now there is ONE victory point spread between Germany and Netherlands (Women)|pg||
nt|yuval10: lol Paul :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|caitlin: I like the 2@D transfer bid showing a weak 2@H for South|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: Yuval we would play it opposite way:)|pg||
nt|ludewig: 5@C is actually a good contract, requires Diamond finesse against opener|pg||
nt|yuval10: hello Bernard|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I would bid 1nt with short but fat majors like AQ and KJx|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho: "dem tod von der Schippe gesprungen" as we say in germany|pg||
pc|c8|nt|stc: EW not in the mood to X a part score again|pg||
nt|riccho: looks like; but 3NT were there for the taking|pg||

nt|pelu: not the best defense - I exp 12 IMPs for Germany here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: allrite, th penultimate board on th way|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  must admit, declarer gave a chance with @c ace|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h position helped|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agreed - but I doubt if we will be making up any Appeal Committee|pg||
mb|1D|nt|h_karluk: 2D in a good day?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|h_karluk: he was busy to find ways to get rid of his @h loser|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 1s ap pretty interesting to me|pg||
nt|pelu: some would open 3@d in W|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's why i wondered|pg||
mb|2H|nt|h_karluk: say you hooked and failed, still @h loser there|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as kib suggested, if @c K is offside, there are 4 losers, but only 4|pg||
nt|mcarroll: or 2@D if weak|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|mcarroll: flat board|pg||
nt|h_karluk: almost carbon copy auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: I agree with several messages that pass by South was a logical alternative. These hesitation situations are always difficult.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Also, it's very easy to say that 5@d is a reasonable bid, because we can see the whole hand and know that the sacrifice is a paying one|pg||
nt|ludewig: of course that is our privilege :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the problem is, 5@d is a logical alternative as well. We all have our own opinions. The TD and Appeal Committee may have different ones.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ludewig: That's why we need them|pg||
pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: disagree that was not easy to retain control, kibber shld suggest ruff sluff, say lost hook and played another trump, where would you park @h losers?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|ludewig: 3NT seems to be unbreakable, but East does not know Spade 10 comes down|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|sfoxa:  has he another options? after @d Q offside|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  double finess in @c, as we see|pg||
nt|ludewig: one could play for 4 diamond tricks (doubleton 10 or Q)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|sfoxa:  @h finess allows limiting your losers to 2 @h, 1 @d and 1 @c|pg||
nt|ludewig: In the meantime Turkey has won Group A|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  is looks like the winner here is clear as well|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Russia has 15 - 15 befor last board|pg||
nt|ludewig: So East is playing for Spade 10 to come down or Diamond finesse|pg||
nt|ludewig: South ducked again, so  East may try diamonds after all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East has a few problems here|pg||
nt|ludewig: very tricky now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  too many options|pg||
nt|ludewig: and all reasonable|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: I use the silent moment to say thanks for watching|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: the next round will be the finals with 2x 12 boards|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ty Lukas for your hard job|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: Israel - Turkey|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thank you, Lukas. Excellent job |pg||
nt|ludewig: as one kib says, ducking Spade ace indicates that S has no club entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: next round we will also have a third vugraph table, which shows the womens final Germany - Russia (just Open Room)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good suggestion from kib - playing small @d now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  leaving all the options alive|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: no worries, the vugraph operator did not felt asleep ;-)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||

mb|p|nt|riccho: a sign that he agrees with the idea of 2@h = forcing... :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|riccho: and shows that the good mood from bd4 didnt last very long|pg||
nt|riccho: :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ludewig: so it could bring 6 Imps if the aother table plays 5|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|yuval10: 2@s is an interesting choice by E, but he has @d shortness and a good @s's and a very bad @h suit to rebid|pg||
nt|riccho: I would dbl 2@h here (as they did in the open room)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@D first time round would have consumed more spade and EW would likely never bid again|pg||
nt|Walddk2: more space  even|pg||
mb|5S|nt|caitlin: agree|pg||
nt|caitlin: I expected 3 with partner as passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: EW on the way to oberbidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: wrong, good stop !!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree with dbl - seeing 3 @h in own hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the wrongest thing could happen thereafer - partner bids 3@c|pg||
nt|riccho: the E hand has no arguments for showing any sort of excitement|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: south looking @@ his scores|pg||
mb|p|pc|h9|nt|stc: looks as -1 wihtout @h guess|pg||
pc|hA|nt|po-s: perhaps 3D would have peen weak in their methods|pg||
