pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|flash: they would be most welcome to participate|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|dburn:  but 4@s probably better than 3NT, although if East were to lead a low heart from the KQ...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|flash: but between possible schedule conflicts, travel expenses, the cost of entering and a form of scoring not to everyone's taste, they choose not to come|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|dburn:  sorry, that was nonsense - 4@s close to hopeless, 3NT much further away from hopeless|pg||

nt|flash: it's a way to show some hand-types which would otherwise be difficult|pg||
