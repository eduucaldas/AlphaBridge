nt|Walddk2: 2 segments of 12 boards tonight, and another 2 tomorrow|pg||
nt|athene: true but getting a freely bid slam two down isn't the sort of defensive disaster that causes people to turn to drink|pg||
nt|warrens:  lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West in 4!X next door|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@HX|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: with @S lead 5@C are on|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|athene: East and South don't realise this is an exciting hand with wild distribution :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bridge_one: 2@C probably landy (majors)|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@C majors; west may bid something like 3@S over 2@D from his partner|pg||
nt|athene: ok, 2nt lebensohl|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt i suppose lebenshol (force 3@C)|pg||
nt|athene: west will presumably bid 3@S over 3@C here|pg||
nt|glensa: i think craig and Alon play rubenshol, so this shows clubs|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: south is thinking about 3nt|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4C|nt|glensa: bosie checks the backs of his cards to see that they look the same as everyone else's|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S is hard the same to play|pg||
nt|athene: south might make 5@C on @SQ lead? pitch the hearts from dummy, ruffing heart finesse, club finesse...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: (without lead @C !)|pg||
nt|athene: the cards are marked - you can lead to @DK then duck and bring down the doubleton ace|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes , lead @s 5@c made|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but i suppose the lead would be A@c to see the dummy|pg||
nt|warrens:  at worst, 4@SX would be down 3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: sry|pg||
nt|athene: south is declarer in clubs|pg||
nt|bridge_one: lead by West !!!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here a case where it is better to play from weak hand :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|newmoon: hi all|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@s introduce a 6/4 strong or a 6/5|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Sid Ismail|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 4@s is possible to bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|newmoon: hi Roland, Giorgio  :)|pg||

nt|bridge_one: the void in @C is easy to see for North|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so J@H will be the return|pg||
nt|athene: yes, hopeful, but they will know that if a hand is dangerous for their opponents it is dangerous for their teammates too|pg||

nt|warrens:  even with a club or diamond return, I don't see how W can avoid -3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North thought South ruffing in @D ...|pg||

nt|warrens:  yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: only one sry|pg||
nt|warrens:  the key was declarer playing the 4th diamond and leaving the club Ace in dummy|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: our third 6-5 major hand in a row|pg||
nt|athene: usually we like to be dealy 6-5 majors|pg||
nt|athene: but it hasn't benefitted west on either of the previous boards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a lot of terribe distribution today !|pg||
mb|p|nt|glensa: there was the 6-5 on the very first board as well, but in spades and diamonds|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: this will be a bit more boring though - 1@H 2@H 4@H i imagine|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|athene: ok, south might fiddle around looking for a miracle slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@s also|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess North could have the 9 right hcp's for slam to be cold|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @SK  @HQ  and a minor ace|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|warrens:  this is almost exactly a 50% slam|pg||
nt|bridge_one: sgl @s 4@h one Ace|pg||
nt|athene: yes, if you can find out and stay below game, you might look|pg||
nt|glensa: that looks like more of a splinter to me|pg||
nt|athene: singleton @S isn't that great as there is a lot of work to do with only three trumps in dummy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@s normally is used with sgl/void - but depending on agreements|pg||
nt|athene: i think slam is just not worth worrying about - i certainly wouldn't risk the 5-level in pursuit of it|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: if 2@H means 3 @H support yes (but not all people play bergen raise)|pg||
nt|warrens:  agreed.  I think S should make a second try here with 4@D, then quit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzkg: 3@s alerted by Craig as shortage|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|bridge_one: 3@s normally is shortage|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  even a spade lead won't help this one|pg||
mb|6H|nt|athene: maybe the players will take the hint, and the next person to pick up a nice hand with 6-5 majors will PASS it|pg||
nt|warrens:  lol|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 4@d perhaps more effective in this sequence that 4Nt|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: OK, let's be fair, it's roughly 50%|pg||
nt|bridge_one: over 4@d north can't bid 4@H with K in @s ...|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sometimes @SK is onside, even in South Africa|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, this slam doesn't make, but can't blame N/S for a (almost) 50% slam|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|bridge_one: but if 3@s is short K in @s isn't usefull, so 4@D less effective (for this reason i told to bid a slow approach to slam starting with 2@S|pg||
