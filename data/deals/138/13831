mb|1H!|an|could be 4|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|flash: hence the 1@H opening|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|flash: 2@C any game force, i believe; 2@D asks|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|flash: 3@C longer suit|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|henryb:  2@c gf, 2@d = normal shape (not 10 cards in two suits) 2@h relay|pg||
nt|flash: possibly control bids in support of @Cs now|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@d asks, 3@h = 3-4-1-5|pg||
nt|flash: aha - we have a translator in the house|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|henryb:  We are now outide my knowledge|pg||
nt|flash: RKCB for @Cs?|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is loosely based on the old Ultimate Club|pg||
nt|flash: Jan incurs a baggage surcharge if he brings the system notes to a tourney...|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzje: i wiish i could help but cant read what they write from here|pg||
mb|5D|nt|henryb:  6N is pretty good, because of the @c9 and the @hJ10|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: 5@D might become a try for a grand|pg||
nt|flash: but these auctions always scare me, since i never know whether someone's likely to pass prematurely|pg||
nt|henryb:  We can all see that on this layout the spots are not needed, but they are the difference between a good contract and one not so good|pg||
nt|flash: you might find some stuff on Ultimate Club at  http://www.bridgeguys.com/conventions.html|pg||
mb|6C|nt|flash: i believe there was a book published; as usual, start with Google and see what shows up  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: 25-minute time limit per 3-board round, with a 2-minute grace period; almost certainly time pressure coming|pg||
nt|reisig: I think 6@c means ...you choose - it'll be your fault|pg||
nt|henryb:  Jim, what is it, 30 minutes per round?|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: well, they win the awards for most bids to reach the contract...|pg||
nt|henryb:  the play will be faster than the bidding|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|flash: again, shorter suit first (canape)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|cavendish: there are session awards that are not inconsequential, so 'out of contention' is not as much of an issue as you might think|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: since the West hand is limited (no 1@C opener), they shouldn't get overboard?|pg||
