mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: Yes, 4@S can be defeated but perhaps not in real life|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Much easier with all cards in view|pg||
nt|geot: Can be set on a minor lead....defence need to get the club ruff|pg||
nt|geot: sure, difficult|pg||
nt|jbgood: who wouldnt lead a heart?|pg||
nt|geot: Heart lead is normal, then easy for delcarer|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|lestergold: 4@s can be defeated in theory unlikely in practice|pg||
nt|geot: I think when North doubled, the normal, modern way of doing it is that opener will pass only when balanced|pg||

nt|lestergold: think bidding here was pretty normal|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s4|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: costly in closed for north to have been so conservative|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|geot: Normal? I would say so, maybe Norths double is quite tough. A winning one this time, though|pg||
nt|lestergold: knife edge decision for north whether or not to find a bid- here is was the winning action|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Both pairs play natutral systems; EW use transfers after 1@C opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  depends on lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but very unlikely -1|pg||

nt|andyv:  maybe A of @d|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rodal f: Belive the @C lead will come.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: Skjetne did not support pd - perhaps concerned that any bidding may help opps|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|geot: Looks like the young guys from Studentenes are coming back now. +650 is huge|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|lestergold: another contract which could have been defeated but needed a doubole dummy defence 5@h in closed|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|geot: 2@S = mini splinter it seems, inviting game with singleton spade and heart fit|pg||
mb|4D|nt|jbgood: can you defeat 5 @h? If you get club ace and club queen, you can play low from dummy and throw a di loser on the club king later..|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@h of course extremely lucky needed two finesses and a non club lead to make|pg||
nt|lestergold: spec asks how 5@h defeated answer club and ruff and must lsolose a dim|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|geot: N/S did well to puch their opps to 5@H by agressive bidding, but then fell from grace as they doubled, and 5@H cant be beaten|pg||

mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: oh my!|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: yes, 5@H is lucky. Need two cards well placed, and must not be tempted to use the club king in trick 2|pg||

mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|rodal f: Or a auto stop at 2@H?|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h should make |pg||
mb|4S|nt|sharkey: A rarity - a weak 2@D opener|pg||
nt|sharkey: the previous board was down 2 - not 1 - will be corrected|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to find A@c and Q@c lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: good vuln save|pg||
nt|andyv:  down at least 500|pg||
mb|5H|nt|rodal f: This contract is playable by a dobble hook in @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: looks reasonable - unless the 4-1 @H break becomes a problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  now it's serious:)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sharkey: A @D lead appears to be best for defence|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S had only 4 losers imo|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: The direct defender always gets two opportunities to bid. |pg||

nt|h_karluk: there are other possibilities such as 4441 distributions Â– assume a weak opener. |pg||
nt|andyv:  like all systems...after a while a decent defense or multiple defenses are found and then we wait for the newest development.|pg||

nt|sharkey: I believe the choice West made, Dbl or 1 NT, is the difference on this board - big pickuup for Grand|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: another 4@s|pg||

nt|rodal f: 2 more bards to go. Next match start 15.45CET or in 1H31M. Then we will see Vikersund agains SingsÃ¥s.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Looks like a weak raise insteed of 3@H as many use as pre empt.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then Terje shldnt pass|pg||

nt|rodal f: 2@D as a @H raise I agree Carl, but how strong?:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: After East's 1@H opening|pg||

nt|sharkey: prefect fit this time |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: interesting cue|pg||

nt|geot: I certainly expect Studentenes to struck back now. They are one of the Gold-favourites, and Grand is not. |pg||
nt|jbgood: as usual we start with the last 2 boards so we may get comparisons later|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|geot: But Grand may surprise. They have a good team, and Terje Lie is one of the best players in the whole field. |pg||
mb|2H|mb|d!|nt|lestergold: eas perfect hand for neg double|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: 4@s can be made hard to reach]|pg||

nt|lestergold: probably will bid thinking its a save|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: will make in practice i would have thought as west will play the strong hand for A@c|pg||
nt|geot: With the diamond Q lead - normal - it may be even easier to win 4@S. With three diamond tricks it is no problem.|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: heart lead?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think 4@s can be defeated tho|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: O don't think it can if declarer guesses clubs, regardless of lead|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|d8|nt|lestergold: as it happems ny miracle position|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|geot: on heart lead, heart ruffed, declarer would pull trumps and give away a diamond. When diamond dont break he is sort of forced to guess clubs |pg||

nt|h_karluk: could be Shirley|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rodal f: They are playing with screens so the thinking don't matter that much as at open tables.|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Who know Shirley?:)|pg||

nt|geot: in fact 800|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This North hand is only suited for a strong club system|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It's virtually impossible to show in a natural system where you must open 2@C|pg||
nt|jbgood: you will bid it as a NT hand I guess|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|Walddk2: That's new to me|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 2NT = 25-27, 3@c = Puppet  OK, so Simonsen treated his hand as balanced|pg||
