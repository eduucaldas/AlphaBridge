nt|mikeyb:  especially a fast player|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|d!|nt|flash: X to show 3-card @H spt|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jcmax: does w have enough for a 2nd dbl now?|pg||
nt|reisig: 4-3-3-3 ..yuck|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|henryb:  Levin-Weinstein bought the hand for 2@s|pg||
nt|jcmax: I am not sure who should compete here, but it is usually not the right strategy to let the opponents play on the 2-level when they have at least an 8-card fit|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|mikeyb:  I think west should X 2 spades|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|c8|pg||
nt|reisig: X would mean -- do something clever|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|mikeyb:  notice levin did not make a game try, 2 spades was weak, 2 h transfer would show a decent 2 spade|pg||
nt|mikeyb:  bid|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mikeyb:  Is west worth a reverse??|pg||
nt|reisig: not to me|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikeyb:  other choices are not so appetizing|pg||
nt|jcmax: If NS had been pushed to the 3-level they would have made that ofc by virtue of the @D finess to pitch a @C-loser|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|flash: let me take advantage of this flattish (?) board to clear the decks; that way we can get preliminary results in next round|pg||
nt|flash: Thanks to World Bridge Productions (Bob Blanchard, Bob Hamman, Billy Rosenbaum and Roy Welland) for sponsoring this event and inviting us to participate.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|flash: Thanks to Jacki at BBO for helping coordinate the commentators.|pg||
nt|mikeyb:  she will play the jack, but still survive by leading a club towards dummy|pg||
nt|flash: And, of course, thanks to Fred Gitelman and the crew at BBO for giving us this great platform|pg||
nt|flash: thnx to our operator, Catalina Robles, for another great session|pg||
nt|flash: and to our commentary crew who've rotated through over the course of the session|pg||
nt|jcmax: This would not be a good deal for leading the @H 10 playing 0 or 2 higher. Declarer would know then not to put up the Q in dummy|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|flash: and, of course, to the specs for trying to keep us on the straight and narrow|pg||
nt|reisig: and failing :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mikeyb:  nobody in the world would lead the 10 from 10965|pg||
nt|flash: all that and only one trick played??|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|nt|jcmax: we don't play against the same people apparently, David .) But OK then let's make it 1098x instead.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|hK|pg||
nt|mikeyb:  now chrsital can breathe|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mikeyb:  or at least the 7|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|c8|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d8|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|mikeyb:  claiming on a double squeeze always seems so pompous|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|mikeyb:  she didnt have it, tho|pg||

nt|mikeyb:  good stop, a few might get higher|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mikeyb:  Some, not me, would bid 2nt with Levins hand|pg||
nt|flash: with a more distributional hand, Rosenberg might've been willing to upgrade to a limit raise with 3 trumps?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|reisig: Levin would rather leave the table :)|pg||
nt|mikeyb:  Not white|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mikeyb:  will steve thank Bobby for the dummy?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jcmax: In an identical situation at the other table W bid on to 3@H over 2@S|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|flash: the dummy of his dreams - as long as he's having nightmares...|pg||
nt|mikeyb:  There may be a few numbers around|pg||
nt|reisig: 3@h over 2@s?  Would never cross my mind|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Richie does not like to collect 420|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|jcmax: I am just reporting :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|reisig: 620 yes ...420 - no|pg||
nt|mikeyb:  no, but if north bids 2nt, E has to bid 3 hearts and south might try 3s|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|flash: down 4 still very much in the picture|pg||
nt|jcmax: To relieve your nightmares it wasn't HH who bid on to 3@H|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|c3|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mikeyb:  Weintein hiding the diamond 2|pg||
nt|jcmax: 2@H in the other apparently was alerted as constructive|pg||
pc|d2|nt|flash: some specs suggested that the 2nd round of @Hs wasn't best; but an interested party has reminded us that by cashing it, West was able to get a suit preference @H8 to help find a ...|pg||
nt|flash: safe shift|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|h9|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|d6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|reisig: Making 3|pg||
nt|reisig: for the opps|pg||
mc|4|nt|flash: so -140 vs -200; not major, but this feels immensely close|pg||
nt|flash: last round coming up...    we'll have preliminary scores through 8 rounds |pg||
nt|reisig: Bill Passell passed away today ...in case you hadn't heard|pg||
