mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|flash: N-S play Ekeblad's home-grown big club system|pg||
nt|lc: Another possible slam with missing queen issues.   Like on the previous deal.|pg||
nt|flash: canape style with tons of relays|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|flash: Ekeblad is from USA; Jansma recently named to represent Netherlands in this year's European Championships|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|jcmax: So, this is another potential slam deal. Some inspired guessing would bring it home.|pg||
nt|lc: 6@H will be popular, but what a complex play probem!  (AT first glance, anyway).|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|lc: Maybe 3@C was 4-4 majors and a max -- just guessing.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|jbgood: de Knijff - Wrand in 6 @h at the other table|pg||
nt|jbgood: Wrang even|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jcmax: In which case 3@D no doubt would be transfer to @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: 46 pairs entered; so each pair plays a round against every other pair|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lc: Anyone want to say how to play 6@H?  Maybe lay down the top @H and ruff @S and @D and then try to take @CAK -- (Taking 8 tricks in aces and kings and 4 ruffs).|pg||
nt|lc: If opps overrruff in late, they might have to break clubs.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|lc: Well, on a @C lead, things get much easier.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|jbgood: got a club lead in the other room too|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|poohbear: Perhaps Ak ruff a @s and when the Q drops you can try a trump finesse . If it doesnt revert to your line Larry|pg||
nt|flash: so a slam bonus swing to Levin-Weinstein on this deal|pg||

nt|jcmax: the bidding sounded like ther was a problem in 1C with S bypassing 4@C. so a @C lead seemed certainly appealing|pg||
nt|lc: This is the kind of board you need to be on the right side of to do well at the Cavendish.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Sexy 1NT by Levin.|pg||
nt|lc: But I kind of like it.  And the rest of you?|pg||
nt|poohbear: i like it|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lc: Notice WEinstein eschewed Stayman with his flattish junk.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|jcmax: I wonder whether the Swedes will win more for bidding and making the slam, than L-W for their opponents not reaching it.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|poohbear: from my experience on the last day more pairs will bid the slam than not|pg||
nt|lc: All roads here would lead to 3NT -- this one should be quite flat (other than overtrick imps).|pg||
nt|jcmax: !NT would definitely be my choice, Larry, if I didn't happen to play 10-12 NT :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: same sequence in the other room:)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|s7|pg||
nt|flash: i'm old-fashioned enuf not to like 1NT there - it might wrong-side a NT contract; it would almost definitely make it more difficult to reach 6@C|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|cT|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h9|nt|lc: Som you would bid 1@C and rebid 2@C, flash -- no other choice once you open 1@C, right?|pg||
mc|10|nt|flash: ayup...|pg||

nt|lc: Another 1NT?|pg||
nt|poohbear: totally|pg||
nt|lc: If 1NT was 15-17, count me in (for North here).|pg||
nt|poohbear: preemptive as well :)|pg||
nt|lc: People watching will begin to think that 1NT promises a 6-card suit somewhere.|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|jcmax: In my view 1NT on this hand is much better opposite a passed hand than a non-passed hand|pg||
nt|flash: natural and limited|pg||
mb|d|nt|flash: (precision-style)|pg||
nt|lc: Note Levin's aggressive entry -- I'm all for it (as a passed hand).|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think 5+ @s and 4@c is a possibility for 2@c opener|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|lc: I like to get in early -- and try to win the partscore battle.  If it turns out to be a N-S game, though, you've squealed on your shape.|pg||
nt|jcmax: The hand contains a very nice suit and is not bad control-wise. so opposite a non-passed hand I would be worried missing an easy slam opening 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: 2@D probably still asks hand-type|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: would a double of 2@d be for take out?|pg||
nt|flash: 2NT denies 4-card major and shows max??|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|jbgood: used to be that Jim|pg||
nt|flash: on this lead, the defense should prevail??|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lc: X of the aritf. 2@D is something partnerships would need to discuss.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|lc: 2NT is probably what flash guessed.  I'd guess.  :)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|flash: a low @D return there would have been truly nasty (but too risky?)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lc: Declarer is in the wrong hand, I'd say.  Why not a @D up earlier, I wonder.|pg||
nt|jbgood: nice defense|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s8|pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|cK|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lc: My students know that "nice defense" is often my code for "poor declaring."|pg||
nt|flash: stick declarer back in with a trump and..|pg||
nt|flash: down 2|pg||
mc|7|nt|vugraphzje: will be back soon, closing table|pg||
nt|lc: Good round for Levin-Weinstein.|pg||
nt|poohbear: nice duck of the second trump by Weinstein . Alllowed him to find out what the @s posiition was. So he knew not to cash|pg||
