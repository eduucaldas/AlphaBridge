nt|vugraphzjf: The focus this morning is Europeans with americans this afternoon. This caters for time differences|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both E & S have 1N opener's for the systems they play|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d!|nt|ahollan1: i think it is GREAT that the organizers arrange pairings that way David!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: DBL = 4@H/@S & 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: N/S in trouble here perhaps|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C pass/correct|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: woolsey seeing trouble bids just 1@D here|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjf: And of course corrects to 2@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reduction bids are highly underutilized :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|vugraphzjf: That lead is probably best looking at the west hand but will turn out badly|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzjf: Please refrain from discussing with me the VG lineups and your preferences. We simply can't please evrybody and do the best we cann|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Next here Levin Weinstein and Woolsey  Martel|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Low spade best here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit's major is still unknown|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: he is playing this heart suit very well|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzjf: The spade lead was MUCH better from the other side|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room Levin playing 2@H from north until saved by Willenken-Welland [ 2NE]|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cJ|nt|chorush: suddenly it looks like it could make|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|h9|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: http://cavendishinvitational.com/webcam/2/table2.jpg demirev Left Martel right|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: As you will see Martel is reading the newspaper as relief from having to watch partner play the hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think @D now|pg||
nt|chorush: Woolsey has no idea how fortunately the diamonds lie|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: @C is high, but could set up late trump promotion    i think|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Defence now likely make three trump tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S endplays declarer -- that's why @D needed earlier -- of course it helps seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|chorush: yes Al ,that is what is going to happen|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still -- nice to see how the defense unravels at this point|pg||

nt|vugraphzjf: Welcome to Ira Chorush|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|vugraphzjf: 6@D will require an inspired diamond guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=20-21|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: NOT Puppet Stayman -- seems strange considering Kit is author|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: I think Martel relieved he can now get  back to his newspaper|pg||
nt|chorush: Nik would ideally like to lead the major North does not have but that QJ10x of clubs is tempting also|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: nice guess|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chorush: Best choice by far. Declarer will sweat before this hand is over|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming 3rd/5th leads -- at least Woolsey confident that @H are 4-4|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s2|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: only needs 4@D for contract|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|d5|mc|10|nt|ahollan1: but gets the overtrick |pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: I think Woolsey thought West may have led from J98 of hearts and wanted to keep East off lead hence the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|chorush: I think he was confident that Nik did not have 5 hearts but not sure if Bart could|pg||

nt|vugraphzjf: OK a slam here|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: But will South make life difficult|pg||
nt|ahollan1: transfers over 1@C?|pg||
nt|chorush: So Nik's good lead has the unfortunate effect (for his side) of causing an overtrick. sometimes not much justice|pg||
mb|2C!|an|strong|nt|ahollan1: hmm  @C getting more respect than @H   totally new concept|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: but look how much it helped the auction after Woolsey butts in|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|chorush: Bramley may get excitd when Nik does not bid 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjf: More likely Demirev is now excited|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Martel and Bramley sahring a joke|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this is developing nicely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room Williken opens west hand 1N    Welland playing 6@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: A turn for the worse now though|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjf: Some minor ethical issue perhaps if Demirev bids now as Bramley took some time but perhaps normal for Bramley to bid 5@C|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: Nik has tough bid. His hand has good points (clubs, no lower honors) and bad (no aces). He got it right|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c3|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Lead is thirds|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: it all comes down to @S  -- and in this case can't go wrong|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s2|mc|12|nt|ahollan1: sometimes The Great Shuffler is on Declarer's side -- but that is the exception instead of the rule|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Closing and reopening|pg||
