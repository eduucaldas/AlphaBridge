mb|1D|nt|flash: welcome to Sabine Auken, Larry Cohen and Jon Sveindal|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|flash: we'll get caught up on details as we can|pg||
nt|jcmax: Hi all |pg||
nt|jcmax: !|pg||
nt|jbgood: Hi - transfers over 1 @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: Catalina Robles at the keyboard again today!!|pg||
nt|po-s: Hi Sabine and Jon|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|po-s: how many will bid slam?|pg||
nt|lc: Hi  -- not many, I'd guess.|pg||
nt|jcmax: As we all can see slam can be made, if declarer divines the @C situation. But why should he?|pg||
nt|lc: Those computers on the hand record printouts always seem to guess the @C :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  And having bid it, how many might make it |pg||
nt|jcmax: With basically no @C-support at all S will be reluctant to move over 3N|pg||
nt|lc: I'd expect most tables to bid as here (but without the transfer), so 1@C-1@H-3@C-3@S-3NT.|pg||
nt|flash: i'll try to squeeze in some background info:|pg||
nt|jcmax: N really has a very good hand. thinking optimistically he almost has 9 tricks in his own hand|pg||
nt|flash: 9 3-board rounds in this, the final session|pg||
nt|henryb:  Say you get a @d lead. You might choose to play @cAK and then try to set up the @h if the @cQ doas not drop|pg||
nt|flash: scoring is IMPs against the entire field|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: Brogeland is in the tank - and passed|pg||
pc|d9|nt|flash: max gain/loss on a board capped at 17 IMPs x 22 comparisons|pg||

nt|flash: back to business  :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: There seems to be doubt as to what the correct technical line for 7 tricks in @C is.|pg||
nt|lc: I wonder why declarer played anti-percentage in clubs.  Not that the overtrick is that crucial in this form of scoring, but still...|pg||

nt|lc: I'd say slightly the finesse -- no?|pg||
nt|jcmax: There should be no doubt at all. Low to the Jack is the percentage play.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|lc: There is software to quickly do the calculation. With a human brain, I'd say it is close, but in favor of finessing.|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|flash: 2NT usually a limit raise with 4 trumps?|pg||
nt|lc: Assuming 2NT is a limit raise, South will bid 4@H.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jbgood: limit plus |pg||
nt|flash: some play limit +|pg||
nt|jcmax: Without the software one can write down all the possible combinations on a piece of paper and then simply count the number of winning plays. that is if one doesn't have anything ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: better to do :)|pg||
nt|lc: Rule of thumb:  When partner makes a 4-trump limit raise, and you have ANY singleton, even with a dead minimum, bid GAME.|pg||
nt|jbgood: good rule|pg||
mb|d!|mb|p|nt|flash: X to show the @D singleton?|pg||
nt|jcmax: Do we know for sure, that N promises 4 trumps though?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzje: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: I dont think Brogeland would play it any other way|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lc: In my local duplicate, -620 would be poor for E-W.  Here, I wouldn't be too worried -- the field (maybe all but 1) will surely reach this VUL game at IMPs.|pg||
nt|flash: that's been one of our recurring themes:  3- vs 4-card raises and calls that might differentiate them|pg||
nt|flash: 25-minute time limit per 3-board round; 2-minute grace period|pg||
nt|flash: we're (of course?) behind screens|pg||
nt|lc: It looks easy for us to make 650 (just play on trumps), but that is far from clear for declarer.|pg||
nt|flash: 46 pairs paid entry fee of $2800 and had to be prepared to buy themselves at auction for another $12,500|pg||
nt|jcmax: the one thing declarer has to worry about is trumps being 3-1. he can pitch one of his 1C-losers on a @S, but still needs to ruff 2 then. and it would be most unconvenient if the ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: opponents could play 3 rounds of trumps|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|lc: But, it is so unlikley a defender has exactly @HAKQ, that this should be okay.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|jbgood: right, Jim, some people would give priority to show the exact min number of trump support, and differenciate between 3 and 4 card supp|pg||
nt|lc: Any other 3-1, playing 3 rounds of @H would give declarer an extra trick back.|pg||
nt|jcmax: Very true, Larry. if anyone has AKQ then probably E. W would not unlikely have led one of those.|pg||
nt|lc: Bergen (my ex-partner) spent his entire life devising bidding systems to distinguish between 3- and 4-card raises.|pg||
nt|lc: And, if East had @HAKQ, the contract would have been 4@HX. |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|flash: we've seen both approaches, particularly after an overcall (Q-bid to show 3; 2NT to show 4)|pg||
nt|lc: Or, "Bergen raises" in comp.|pg||
nt|jbgood: the common method|pg||

nt|jcmax: The rationale behind declarer's trump play at trick 1 is: Give up a trump, and if they cannot draw 3 rounds, i can simply abandon trumps and ruff my @C!-losers. all the defenders ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: ever will be able to get is at most 3 trump tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: now, the number of issues to be discussed has ballooned|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lc: 6@D here would be better than 6@S.|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|flash: xfer|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jbgood: To an asking kib: Brogeland is Norwegian, and malinowski is a Pole who spent quite a few years in Norway, and lives in England no|pg||
nt|lc: I'd guess a few pairs might actually reach 6@D -- which basically is on the @SQ (the @H suit is no problem since there is a discard).|pg||
nt|flash: i seem to recall there are potentially additional issues attached|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: 3@S most likely 4 trumps in a non-max hand|pg||
nt|lc: I've written about and seen so many famous deals where the 4-4 provides a trick more than the 5-4.  |pg||
mb|3N!|nt|jcmax: It may not be easy to get to 1D, though, once W super-accepts the transfer|pg||
nt|lc: And, most experts are attuned to this ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: slam try of some ilk|pg||
mb|4D|nt|flash: non-serious??   (as opposed to serious)|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: control bid (denying @C control)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|flash: control bid|pg||
nt|lc: East might now envision :   @SAQxx  @HKxx  @DAKxx  @Cxx  or the like|pg||
nt|flash: (implying @C control)|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|flash: rkcb|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: 2 key cards without the Q|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|jcmax: If indeed 3N was a non-serious slam-try, the 4@H cue-bid now also promises a @C control, since partern's 4@D bid denied one.|pg||
nt|lc: Of course, we can see that 6@S would need not only the @SQ, but the @H finesse -- which loses.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|lc: So, good news-bad news for E-W -- in that they missed out on 1370 in 6@D, but avoided -100 in 6@S.|pg||
nt|jcmax: And there would be no point in cuebidding a @H-control, when E knows the @C-control is missing|pg||
nt|jbgood: so even 5 @s is a bit uncomfortable|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lc: Likely, the field will play a @S game.  But, some E-W will play 6 something for a huge swing.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
nt|flash: again, for security reasons, both tables will close briefly between rounds|pg||
mc|11|nt|flash: we realize this cuts down on our discussion time, but the integrity of the contest is paramount|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: will reopen soon with rd 2|pg||
nt|jcmax: A partnership that plays 2NT over 2@H as 4-card super acceptance of @S may still have a chance tofind the @D-fit|pg||
