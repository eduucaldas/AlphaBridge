nt|lc: One team was down 19 IMPs -- the bidding was crazy.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Anyway -- new deal is here.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|3C|nt|lc: You'd think most N-S reach 4@H here.|pg||
nt|flash: new suit at the 1-level:  non-forcing, constructive?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|lc: Matter of partnership agreement, of course.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Opening lead ?|pg||
nt|lc: I'll guess @CA|pg||
nt|poohbear: trend now is to play intermediate jump overcalls vulnerable. Guess LW dont do that|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcmax: Isn't 3@C also a matter of partnership agreement? Some partners might expect a stronger hand for that.|pg||
nt|lc: In "Standard," sure--3@C would show more, Sabine.|pg||
nt|lc: Must be systemic.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|lc: Unless their 1@C opening is limited -- would need to see their conv card.|pg||
nt|jcmax: I agree, Larry, @C A lead is a very practical choice. if partner has a singleton @C there would be good chances to beat the game|pg||
nt|lc: This is a little awkward transportation-wise for declarer -- but it's hard to see him having any problems making his contract.|pg||
nt|flash: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards%5C2007BermudaBowlShanghai/bermuda-bowl/Netherlands/brink-driver_RRCard.pdf|pg||
pc|d4|nt|flash: toned-down version of the E-W card; they'll have dropped a couple more conventions for this competition|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|flash: 1@C is 2+, with 3 possible hand-types|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|c6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lc: So, +650 to N-S -- which should be a small gain against the field.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s6|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|jcmax: Same result for H-H at the other table, so "no swing" here|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lc: You'd expect a slew of 620's and 650's on this one.|pg||

qx|o8|st||md|2SKQT52HQ92D9532CQ,S3HT864DA4CT98752,SJ76HK73DQJ876CA4,SA984HAJ5DKTCKJ63|sv|o|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|mb|1S|nt|lc: A "modern" opening bid for North.  Al Roth turning in his grave.|pg||
mb|d!|mb|r!|nt|flash: Alvin and Tobias are seldom pleased with opening bids these days|pg||
nt|flash: XX = 3-card spt for @Ss|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lc: Tobias isn't pleased.  Alvin probably isn't aware.|pg||
nt|poohbear: What do we think of Dbl vs. 1NT with East?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|poohbear: I like 1NT to define my hand|pg||
nt|lc: I like X.  Meckstroth is a 1NT bidder, I know.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|lc: Berkowitz is a doubler.|pg||
nt|lc: Style.|pg||
nt|poohbear: I am told they dont have a natural 1NT available|pg||
nt|lc: In that case, X for sure :)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|lc: E-W are the @H9 away from 51C being a decent game.|pg||
nt|jcmax: EW at the other table reached 5@C, which could potentially become exciting|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: Raptor - 4-card major; 5-card minor  -  as i recall|pg||
nt|jcmax: Suppose the lead is a @S|pg||
nt|jcmax: DEclarer wins and ruffs a @S and plays a @C up|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lc: Actually, 3NT is simply on the @C.|pg||
nt|flash: trump lead would settle issues, but...|pg||
nt|jcmax: If N ducks and declarer guesses to play the K, he is home and dry|pg||
nt|lc: 20 HCP E-W, yet 3NT is so nice -- and might make (since declarer is maybe forced to play North for the @CA once @S are 5-3)|pg||
nt|jcmax: He can eliminate @S + @D and exit a trump and N will be endplayed.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|c2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|lc: Right, Sabine -- but if North takes the @CA, and exits in @C, it looks like -1 -- but our little cheating device (GIB) says it makes.|pg||
nt|lc: So, we have to figure out how.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|jcmax: And if N does go up with the @C K, declarer can still achieve an endgame later by guessing the @H-layout|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lc: Yes.  @H to J to endplay South.|pg||
nt|lc: Just took a minute.  :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: He eliminates again @S+@D and plays a @H to the J in the endgame. S wins but has to lead away from his 9. all it needs is some guessing :)|pg||
nt|lc: tks to all who are trying to help as we try to type, think, analyze, make jokes, all at once. :)|pg||
nt|lc: So, double-dummy we see the way to 11 tricks -- and single dummy, declarer will likely find the line.|pg||
nt|lc: Any bets?|pg||
nt|jcmax: I still haven't learnt to read other comments and continue analyzing, while I am typing. sorry! :( I am sure my mother would be much better at that .)|pg||
nt|flash: seems as though Levin had defense pre-planned?   apparently no thought of @C return??|pg||
nt|lc: And poor Sabine has to do all of this in 1 of her 3 fluent languages.|pg||
nt|lc: Are you analyzing in German or Danish, Sabine?|pg||
nt|jcmax: the card symbols are in english, no choice then :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|c5|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|poohbear: in the other room declarer misguessed the ending by leading the 10 @h in the end game . So H &H beat 5@c|pg||
nt|lc: Surely, there is some card-reading required in the @H suit -- one way or the other.|pg||
nt|flash: the @D return has pushed declarer toward the elimination?|pg||
nt|jcmax: In any event for bridge ther is no better language than English in my view!|pg||
nt|poohbear: basically boils down to who you think has the 9|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|c8|pc|d8|pg||
nt|lc: Now the moment(s) of truth.|pg||
nt|poohbear: and if your card reading is good enuff to figure that out I want you as a teammate or  artner :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h2|mc|11|nt|lc: Well done by Drijver.|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcmax: HH's opponents went down at the other table. will that make up for the slam board, you think?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: 2@S probably 5@S  4@H  inv -- a popular treatment these days.|pg||
nt|lc: And s 2@H response (to either minor) is the same shape, but weaker.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|lc: Some call this treatment "Reverse Flannery"|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|jcmax: This for sure will be a pick-up for L-W as HH opened the bidding with the N hand at the other table and reached game going down 2|pg||
nt|lc: Not such a good game.  :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|sT|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|c2|pc|d9|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|c9|nt|lc: One of the biggest changes in bridge every decade is how the requirements to bid game seem to get lower and lower.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|lc: When I learned bridge, they taught me 26 points for game  (and 29 for 5-of-a minor)!|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
nt|flash: we seem to have a director call to the 'broadcast booth'  -  it appears as though Larry made an insufficient bid earlier...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lc: On the previous deal it was 5@C on 20.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|flash: Sabine is fluent in more than 3 languages??|pg||
mc|10|nt|vugraphzje: will be back soon, closing table|pg||
nt|flash: back soonest   :)|pg||
