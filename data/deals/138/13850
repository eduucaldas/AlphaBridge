nt|lc: Will N-S reach 3NT with their 25 HCP?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lc: I like 1NT with North's hand, then 3NT by South.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: This could lead to 4@S.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: 1NT in the balancing seat would typically show 11-15 hcp, so that certainly would be an option|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lc: 3NT would have been much easier -- with the 4 @H tricks to start with.|pg||
nt|lc: Declarer could/should guess trumps via restricted choice on the 3rd round.|pg||
nt|lc: @SK, @SA, then a @S to the 9.|pg||
nt|lc: That gives him 9 tricks -- and he'll need to come up with 1 more|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|jcmax: Still I don't see how declarer can arrive at a 10th trick|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|lc: East will have to discard on the 3rd and 4th trump -- but can survive.|pg||
nt|jcmax: If he tries to ruff @D in dummy, there are threatenign @H ruffs|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lc: For those asking about Restricted Choice (which I mentioned) : http://www.larryco.com/BridgeArticles/ArticleDetails.aspx?articleID=103|pg||
nt|flash: so the hand essentially reverts to NT, but, as Larry mentioned, 9 tricks in 3NT worth a bit more than 9 tricks in 4@S...|pg||
nt|lc: Indeed!|pg||
nt|jcmax: On this line of play now e must hold on to all his @H and also be careful to unblock the @CK under the A|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|lc: Here is the pressure East faces ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: If he holds on to his K he will be thrown in with it and has to give declarer a @D trick|pg||
nt|po-s: declarer can play a club and duck EastÂ´s king|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|jcmax: decisive moment!|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lc: Complicated.  How dull this would have been in 3NT.  :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: DEclarer can make now, because E failed to play the @CK|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lc: Declarer has to guess if East blanked his @DA or not.|pg||
nt|jcmax: Then wwe could have talked about the weather instead, larry.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|hK|nt|lc: I'd guess most tables indeed bid  1@H  P P 1NT  P  3NT .|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|c8|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d4|nt|jcmax: It's freezing cold here in copenhagen btw :)|pg||
mc|10|nt|lc: It's very hot in Florida.|pg||

nt|jcmax: Well played by rogoff indeed!|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|nt|lc: Although it is hazardous to think about the previous board for the players, surely L-W are aware that 3NT is a make, so -620 is not the complete disaster it originnaly feels.|pg||
nt|flash: but Levin also realizes the opportunity missed...|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|lc: It has become S.O.P. to make a takeout X with a hand such as WEst's here.|pg||
nt|flash: xfer to 1NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jcmax: it is not really a loss for LW, because most pairs will be making 3NT. but it is the kind of thing that can be nagging a player. At all times and especially in an event like this ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: it is very important to just put it away and forget about it.|pg||
nt|lc: With nice 12 or 13 counts and 4-3-3-3, double 1 of a minor and get in early.|pg||
nt|lc: Hamman is THE BEST at putting it behind him and getting to the next deal. So important.|pg||
nt|jcmax: I could not agree with you more, larry. really admirable!|pg||
nt|lc: And, I'm sure the specs might like to see us do the same and address  11 :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: was North's huddle an overbid?|pg||
nt|lc: For me, I'd say it was.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lc: My partners open junk dealer white, so I wouldn't dream of moving after 1NT.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|jcmax: HH's opps at the other table also reached 4@S on bd 1, but went down|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|poohbear: Fredin Fallenius breezed into 3NT after 1NT 14-16|pg||
nt|jcmax: Several kibs asking about the 1@S bid. It was already explained by flash earlier as a transfer to 1NT. it pays to read the comments .)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|lc: So, on this very lucky lie, game is there, but I'd guess only 1 or 2 pairs will stumble into it.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|flash: since we expect most to be in 3NT on board 10, the vul game swing should be huge for H&H|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lc: Actually, if N-S range is 14-16, it could easily go 1N-3N -- so I'll modify my guess to a handlful of pairs will be in it.|pg||
pc|hA|mc|10|pg||
qx|o12|st||md|2SAQ84H7DK732CJ854,S3HAQT63DAQJT94C7,SK652HKJ842D85C62,SJT97H95D6CAKQT93|sv|n|mb|1D|nt|jcmax: Finally some distribution!!!!|pg||
nt|lc: Action here -- yes.|pg||
nt|lc: West hand good enough to reverse.  So @D first, then @H, @H.|pg||
nt|jcmax: Will any N overcall 1@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: With weaker 5=6, open 1@H.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|lc: Vul, I would NOT open 1@H -- but I suppose you could find some lunatic who would.|pg||
nt|lc: :)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|lc: Sorry to all you lunatics out there.|pg||
nt|poohbear: overcall u mean|pg||
nt|lc: I meant OVERCALL 1@H|pg||
nt|lc: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: 2@S not necessarily length, although after the 2/1, it tends to be naturalish|pg||
nt|jcmax: the auction timed out very nicely for W so far. he got to show his exact distribution.|pg||
nt|lc: I wonder about 2@C -- can someone look up if GF?|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: yes GF|pg||
nt|lc: It seems unlikely Levin would force to game opposite a white 1@D opening.|pg||
nt|lc: I guess he likes his black 10-9's.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Apparently not GF.  This seems strange.|pg||
nt|flash: there are 2 versions of 'Eastern Scientific' - one uses a rebid of the 2/1 suit to show the invitation; one uses an original jump shift (down) to show it|pg||
nt|jcmax: Maybe he envisioned the bidding going 1D-1S-"D if he responded 1S and didn't know what he would do over that?|pg||
nt|flash: thnx, Catalina - GF it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: they alerted GF here|pg||
nt|lc: Could Levin have just "taken a position" and violated system?  That's what is seems.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|poohbear: so much for the Loonies that overcalled 1@h :)|pg||
nt|lc: A 1@H overcall could beget NEG X, all pass.|pg||
nt|flash: trump shift rather clear?|pg||
nt|lc: You'd think.|pg||
nt|lc: You'd also think most E-W will be in 3NT.|pg||
nt|lc: And ...|pg||
nt|lc: Make it or not make it, I suppose :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jcmax: N apparently led a 3rd best @S. if N only has 3 1S s would really like to cash another @S before shifting to a trump|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lc: In 3NT, looks like 5@D 1@H and 3@C if you can get them.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|jcmax: DEclarer's distribution could very easily be 2560|pg||
nt|flash: absent a trump shift, declarer gets to use dummy's trumps to set up @Ds ??|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|h5|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|h6|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|flash: Weinstein playing to 'single in' his small trumps|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|d4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|lc: Sorry to divert from the play at hand, but it occurs to me that some tables could start:  1@D-1@S-2@H-2N-3@H-3N PPP -- and declarer gets a @C lead into the unbid suit!|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|pc|hT|pc|sK|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|hJ|pc|c3|pc|d7|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
mc|9|nt|lc: Wouldn't I love to be playing, so I could lead a @C from Jxxx into East's clubs?  :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: That might very well happen at the other table, Larry. Fallenius on lead now against this auction|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, hard to say how this 140 will be for E-W.  I expect some -50's and some 400's.|pg||
nt|jcmax: And he did lead a @C!|pg||
nt|flash: i've had some questions about estimating swings with only 1 other (important) table in view|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: Closing table, will reopen wight away|pg||
