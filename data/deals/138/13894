mb|p|mb|1C|mb|3S|nt|brolucius: Surely 4@S was the bid. Why not?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s X is a good save vs 6@d making|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT now from West looks right.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|yuval10: and now?|pg||
nt|ady: Israel got a good result in CR -500 in 4@SX     should be -800  and e/w have a cold small slam in diamonds|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|yuval10: i think E will make a move.... he knows P doesn't have much @s's ( he didn't pass for penalty ) and doesn't have @h's as he didn't X|pg||
nt|brolucius: Maybe 4@D was better than 4@S. We will see if they find the diamond fit.|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s looks like a very intelegantic bid by E|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S sounds more like a gigantic club hand, rather than looking for a fit elsewhere.|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|yuval10: not sure...then why not bid 4@c first?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@D implies longer clubs, so looks better to me.|pg||
nt|ady: south overcalled 4@S CR   P   P    double   passed out|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is exactly why 4@S was the right bid. Go as high as you can straight away - to remove bidding space.|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Entirely East's fault.|pg||
nt|yuval10: hmmm....|pg||

pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was predictable that 4@S would lead to problems. The first duty in any auction is to look for a trump suit, not just say that you have a good hand.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzkm: he can make now i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: shorten his @cs|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now he needs a trump coup.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: ruffing 2@ss in hand and playing 4 rounds of @h with @d disc.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: using 2 @d entries before|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: to ruff|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, that will be splendid if he can combine some awful bidding with some inspired cardplay to pick up 920!|pg||
nt|ady: what happens if north plays low on first diamond    I think an entry short|pg||
nt|yuval10: big hand for a start....and it's only 24 boards|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Russian ladies bid and made 7@D. Well done to them!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: but he may not put S on 8212, what he needs to succeed|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c6|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s3|nt|brolucius: Declarer will soon get a count on the diamonds. He knows to within one card how many spades South holds.|pg||

mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  hello, Martin|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I am surprised that W passes in this position|pg||
nt|desert: the german pair at this table play a straightforward precision base with a 10-12 NT Nvul|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Rather than bid a competitive 3@S|pg||
nt|yuval10: she even|pg||
nt|pelu: its is not a light opening: 1@D = 9+ and 4 card|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|desert: Facing a 10-12 NT 3 Sp looks more risky :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: would've been better to overcall 1 as it turns out|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: hello and welcome|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Yes I thought it should have been bid and conveyed it.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, E had maximum and 4 cards fit - only 2 @s ? |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello Sveta, Mike and Bernard|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and to operator Lukas|pg||
nt|ludewig: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: we had technical problems, so we start in bbo with board 14|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if ddl was major/minor, would have expected 2@h if that was pass/coreect|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mcarroll: Following the Law nonvul in particular I would bid 3@S|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sfoxa:  anyway, N has to be magician to bring this game home |pg||

pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: if you play these style tings, you have to work out your pass/correct bids, and work out which ones are natural  |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: only two to qualify?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|ludewig: I suppose X simply showed one minor|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  if so, then only Israel and Russia have chances in this group|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: the rest is playing swiss system|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would choose pass as West, i don't think singleton @cK good enough, secondly i don't have 6 baggers|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Unless N follows the Rabbi's Law and drops the sigleton @C K this will be several off, and even so has only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|djneill: here, North had a choice between a takeout double of 1@c, and 1NT with a good doubleton|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: brown sticker?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  margin between them is big enough 104 - 121 as you can see here: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC_2010/10_05_12_dma.html|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3rdly i only have ugly 8 HCP|pg||
nt|desert: Well 3 @S would have been down 1 probably. Now East West will get a plus score....|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|rnmalik: Good shift to 10@S and back to @C and declarer has no problem now.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ludewig: West is trying to find a layout that avoids the spade loser|pg||

nt|yuval10: interesting, seem like both tables diesn't play supprot X|pg||
nt|yuval10: doesn't even|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: Some play that 2@S promises four-card support and you use a Support Redouble with three-card support (on a hand of any strength).|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|vugraphzkm: and without a double?|pg||

nt|djneill: should be a flat board, give or take a trick, no?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|h_karluk: th issue abt to bid what you see own hand, while you do not have an idea abt others holdings|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: likely a part score for NS|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Agree.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  you can play as a Deep Finess all the boards - but what does it matters, if next door defenders apply DBL and allow overtricks... |pg||
mb|2C|nt|djneill: South does not play support XX to show 3 spades, but North will reveal the @d fit so it is moot|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they will probably end in 3@d|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: The Ladies competition is much closer than the Open - 4 teams witin 5 VPs |pg||
nt|yuval10: S might try 2NT here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: perhaps everybody picked hard way, indeed rare and unusual|pg||
nt|ludewig: Could end in 2 Spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: some play here that over 2@d by North, if East doubles again, it shows "good @c raise"|pg||
mb|2H|nt|djneill: while 3@c is "bad @c raise"|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Anything beyond 2@C would be a minus score for EW.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|sfoxa:  actually, not so dramatic. but somethings like this :-)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: but unless S starts with 2N not comfortable for 3N|pg||
nt|ludewig: S has 6 losers|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perhaps 2@s by South at his third turn would show a stronger hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: and as my partner says - in teams there is no such contract as 2NT it is either 1 or 3|pg||
nt|ludewig: most pairs pay this as stronger indeed and some tend to raise spades immediately with a weak hand and 3 cards|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  popular agreement indeed. but this time, S's hand isn't strong enough. must have 15-17, I suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i ve no idea N bought tho knows 18-19 there, cannot see any extras or much cover cards|pg||
nt|yuval10: W will do best to duck it|pg||
nt|pelu: N hope for a 5 card @C by pd|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just a balanced 4423 with an Ace and 2 J|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c may be only a three-card suit - if \ West had a 4333 shape, for example|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: oh i forgot to add 2 tens, lol|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sfoxa:  this time 3NT is far better|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|djneill: that's true, would be risky adventure to bid to 3-level vulnerable with 13-15 combined HCP|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|pelu: need "just" Hx in @cs by west|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: after this board i will make a short restart of bbo, because the scores are not transfered into the open-room :(|pg||

nt|ludewig: West has everything under control|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sfoxa:  his @s return followed by @c when in with @h ace will promote trump trick for defence|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|djneill: West here would love to attack the long @c suit, but an unsupported Ace is a no-no at suits|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

pc|s2|nt|h_karluk: and now drums beating|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we'll see what will appear from that empty hat|pg||
nt|pelu: the real chance was to play on @Cs - this plan only work if mistake by opp|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and teeth gnashing|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh, I'm wrong - this time declarer prevails|pg||
nt|djneill: now we could have a promotion in @c |pg||
nt|djneill: North trying to work out whether going for ruffs will work better than giving a promotion (ruffing just once by North does nothing since it is a natural trick)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: regarding the previous board, it is often said that every convention comes with a price. Support (re)Doubles are all very well, but they do allow the opponents the option of ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bid/pass, as opposed to (as we saw) bid, of possibly indeterminate strength |pg||
nt|djneill: true|pg||
nt|djneill: so North could play a spade, ruff, @d, ruff, @c, promotion|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That is true and the agreement between partnerships foremost.|pg||
nt|djneill: but if North ruffs too much, now it is South's ruff that does not gain a trick :-)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. The Support route has the advantage of establishing the degree of fit early, which may well be important if the auction gets competitive.|pg||
nt|djneill: I have never tried to be much of a bidding theorist with geniuses above me doing the good work and testing, so if they play something, I play it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but by that time NS may have enough ruffs to defeat the contract |pg||
nt|djneill: since at IMPs the goal is to set the contract first, and get undertricks second, I think North is just imagining all the scenarios that matter, not this particular one (always ...|pg||
nt|djneill: down)|pg||
nt|djneill: for instance, East could have 3 @h|pg||
nt|djneill: South could have @cQJ and North may underlead the @cK :-(|pg||
nt|djneill: the unsupported Q lead is so rare, this might actually happen after a @s ruff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, it's hard to imagine in defence that the opposition are on a 5-1 fit|pg||
nt|djneill: South should deliver a @s ruff with a high @s for a high suit pref (@d)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even without @d continuation, N can take 9 tricks. now it's much more easier|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe the question could be in case 3@h rebid scenario would N decide to 3N or not|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes the @D continuation makes it easier|pg||
nt|djneill: the @s2 should be a singleton, no?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: for me yes.|pg||
nt|djneill: Poles would scoff|pg||
nt|djneill: I don't hear any scoffing|pg||
nt|po-s: if they play Polish he might have a doubleton|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: after king-ace at the previous trick, South would surely lead the queen if he had it.|pg||

mb|d|nt|ludewig: Hi everyone again, now with scores from the Open Room|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  after partner revealed 18 points? quite normal|pg||
nt|h_karluk: remember please, passed to 1@s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 1@h then spades would give better info <responder reverse>|pg||
nt|h_karluk: moreover could be an early fit on @h suit|pg||

nt|h_karluk: the problem there you can never know if there's 3 pieces @h support with that approach|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|h_karluk: bloody board, obv 5@c fails esp after @h K lead, surprised to lead and no double there|pg||

nt|h_karluk: for now  club pitch fine|pg||
nt|h_karluk: two way @h Q hook, problems abt entry to hand, not a happily 3N tho prsopects seems not much bleak|pg||
nt|mcarroll: or @H pitch|pg||
nt|pelu: difff lead for West - she know that S is 2-2-5-4 - but what to lead?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would rather save that @h|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: When 3@D is forcing to game (which is the best way to play it), North's 3@S is stronger than 4@S.|pg||

nt|rnmalik: but for @H return by N would be -3, I think.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting board - 6@D has good play for NS|pg||
nt|djneill: I think they will find 6@d if East does not interfere|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6NT on the lie too|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  right. my personal record is winning 128-boards match by 1 imp|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|pelu: F1|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@D better who so ever plays-whereas N has to be the declarer at 6NT.|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: of course, on this sort of hand, it is easy to lock into spades - let's see|pg||
nt|djneill: hmm, North's hand just improved, the @hK went from half a trick to a almost a full trick|pg||
mb|2S|an|3!s|mb|3C|nt|h_karluk: I guess 2C invite or better on comp|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so over X classic sys on|pg||
mb|3D|nt|h_karluk: 1@h fake suit, maybe 1N different range|pg||
nt|h_karluk: wonder alert to 1@h also or not|pg||
nt|mcarroll: or maybe 1@D shows @Hs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be, saw similar samples|pg||
nt|pelu: would u bid 2@H? - @sK in front of opener - I would pass |pg||
nt|h_karluk: auto pass|pg||
nt|djneill: ah yes, it's slam time|pg||
nt|djneill: South is short in @c, where East has strength, so North's strength is not as much wasted as it could be|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 5 HCP, sorry partner|pg||
nt|pelu: almost only 2 Jacks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i dont wanna toss barriers|pg||
nt|ludewig: Lebensohl to 3@H, South likes it|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ludewig: so this must have been invitational or even forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3@c doesn't improve North's hand though|pg||
nt|djneill: yep|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: although he could bid 4@D. He has already shown spade support.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but still, this is a hard slam to get to.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|nt|mcarroll: Interesting - esp with singleton @C A|pg||
nt|ludewig: probably 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: short break by me, c u|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E's hand is worth an invite, but I'd prefer to hear 4@h from partner|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|h_karluk: so half of natural half relays, i didnt see any difference except nat bidders would rebid 1N and S offers 2N then all pass|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|ludewig: 4 diamonds, 3 Hearts and two black tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  yes, 10@s matters|pg||
nt|ludewig: but not clear to West which entry North has|pg||
nt|ludewig: if Clubs first he goes down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: even then has 11 tricks unless A@C is played.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ludewig: well done|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even now, @c return from S looks dangerous|pg||
nt|ludewig: If North had held both heart king and club ace, you need to play club imediately|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|sfoxa:  does S consider to duck?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: here in this group it seems to be clear, that israel get on 1st place, but in th other group there are just 2 VP between the first and the 4th place now!|pg||

mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: does not have to make|pg||
nt|brolucius: The text-book recommendation against 6NT is to look for a safe lead. (Although there are still a few mad players around who do not believe this...)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yuval10: @c lead is very nice from E|pg||
nt|brolucius: Safer to lead from x-x-x-x than from x-x.|pg||
nt|po-s: spade finesse or small heart from ace, then squeezing West.... not obvious|pg||
nt|ady: vlub is safe enough      any major suit lead gives it|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|brolucius: Declarer will make some early play in the heart suit before committing himself in spades.|pg||

nt|ady: west discarded a spade in closed room on the 3rd or 4th diamond|pg||

nt|ady: once west shows shortage in diamonds   declarer may get spades right|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: West looking @@ N/S cc|pg||
nt|brolucius: West may be able to guess the club position because declarer cashed the @CQ, but North did open 1@C.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: some asking, too|pg||
nt|brolucius: West is no doubt discovering which hand types are covered by a 1@C opening. |pg||
nt|brolucius: He will have looked closely at East's club spots too, calculating if 7 and 5 are the partnership's agreed cards from 9-7-6-5.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Of course West is slightly suggesting that he has something worthwhile to keep in spades.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC_2010/10_05_12_dma.html for results of the finals and the swiss|pg||
nt|ady: low heart to the jack after the diamonds should bring success    west would almost certainly play low and would then later be squeezed    but if west should know to play the queen ...|pg||
nt|ady: then declarer might go wrong|pg||
nt|po-s: cashing the second club might not be what one does with our of them|pg||
nt|po-s: four of them|pg||
nt|brolucius: Nor would leading a doubleton club into declarer's first-bid suit. |pg||

nt|ady: sorry tht the contract was 2@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the face of it, North had little reason to bid again over 1NT - other than to spare 1206 kibitzers from the sorry spectacle of watching the play in such a mundane contract.|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: but did north show any game aspirations   3NT seemed agressive     maybe 2@C was some sort of consructiive check back|pg||

nt|pelu: as u see S was "squeezed" to discard a @h|pg||
nt|mcarroll: as my grandmother used to sy - the only chance is the best chance|pg||
nt|h_karluk: jaja:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: positive that was the only catch.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Flannery?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|h_karluk: 1@s seems lesser evil|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Roland's favourite convention|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we are in luck, Roland is busy a lot|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 5@H, 4@S 11 -15|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if only point were divided 20 to 20 as well )))|pg||
mb|1S|nt|h_karluk: time for a splinter?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh bergenish|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@c = Bergen|pg||
nt|mdgraham: always easier when you see all the hands, though ;)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  time for vulnerable EW game and (possible) NS save|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: however that doesn't mean a sudden thunderstorm not occurs :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what a wide range, 6-12|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pelu: 6-12 is a wide range, I prefer 3@C = 10-12, and 3@D = 7-9|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS have double red fit and some points|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 3D normal in my book, anyways not sure abt 4D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4NT from South, one suspects|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless Norht gets there first |pg||
nt|ludewig: he is thinking about it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, after partner's free bid |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Q - would 5@d from South show longer diamonds?|pg||
nt|ludewig: and West might take the push to 5 Spades|pg||
nt|djneill: there it was helpful that North was declaring, and had not shown 4 spades yet, West had no chance I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: agreed Peter, that was the way we played on OKB 97-2000|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now S is limited by his partner pause (((|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not necessarily - screens?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|h_karluk: @c 5 ??|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a deception try|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  indeed - I forgot it|pg||
nt|djneill: interesting lead!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|pelu: I like A'es - but not @DA here :)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: worked|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good hand for declarer-cards nicely placed.|pg||
nt|djneill: South will never know about the @h finesse working until the 2nd finesse, since holding up is kind of standard in these situations|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ludewig: 5@d looks nomal to me, should show longer diamonds than hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: me too|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with red kings, E must be happy to dbl it|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: wow|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I prefer 3@C = 6-9 and 3@D =10-11 - easier to remember for me anyway|pg||
nt|h_karluk: don't push - just try to hide one on yr sleeve:p|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so we all dislike that wide range|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True Hamdi|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ludewig: 4 Imps if down 500|pg||
nt|ludewig: and 8 if 300|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If there was any slowness about the screen coming through, South can infer that it was North who was thinking. It was unlikely to have been West. So maybe there could be some ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ethical constraints. Even so, South has a reasonable 5@D bid.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|h_karluk: finesse and ruff|pg||
nt|pelu: they Play 1M - 3@D = 11-12 and 3 card support|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but still D A entry|pg||
pc|h5|nt|h_karluk: 7-9 fine with me|pg||
nt|pelu: they need some special bids when they open 9+ HCP|pg||
nt|h_karluk: obv|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Sorry, East|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|h_karluk: same story|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: TD here...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: (To several viewers) the TD might well be called, but we cannot attribute hesitations, as the operator does not always operate in "real time" - he enters the bids in pairs when ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they come throught he screen |pg||
nt|ludewig: North did think a very long time it seems |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Indeed. But 5@D seems ok, given the spade length.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: yes, it was really a longer time for me...|pg||
nt|ludewig: obviously it is not East who has been thinking|pg||

nt|brolucius: A bit ambitious, perhaps.|pg||
nt|yuval10: i persume it will be "bid your major in transfer"|pg||
nt|ady: multi from  west    e/w can make 4@H and with decent major holdings with east should get to game|pg||
mb|4C|nt|brolucius: I see. Well, OK of course if it has that meaning - which would be clever.|pg||
nt|brolucius: You were right!|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C though an excellent save for n/s|pg||
nt|brolucius: South is no doubt interested in the meaning of 4@C.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|d|mb|4H|nt|brolucius: As Yuval explained to us, 4@D was a transfer to the major-suit that he had length in.|pg||
nt|ady: would assume 4@C says pick your major  and west bids a tranfer   4@D = hearts  and 4 hearts = spades|pg||
nt|yuval10: S know that EW has at least a 9 cards fit ...perhaps he'll find a move then |pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: There is nothing in the South hand that suggests 4@H will go down, so he has to judge how expensive 5@C will be.|pg||
nt|ady: would be a poor result for Turley to allow 4@H to play|pg||

nt|pelu: not the best defense - I exp 12 IMPs for Germany here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: allrite, th penultimate board on th way|pg||
nt|djneill: the double holdup in @h would have been quite deep|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  must admit, declarer gave a chance with @c ace|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h position helped|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agreed - but I doubt if we will be making up any Appeal Committee|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS will be quite pleased with the look of their card|pg||
nt|djneill: yeah|pg||
mb|2D|nt|h_karluk: 2D in a good day?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: plus scores good, minus scores bad|pg||
mb|3C|mb|4D|an|bid partner :)|nt|h_karluk: he was busy to find ways to get rid of his @h loser|pg||
nt|djneill: yeah, what a formidable line of plus scores|pg||
mb|5C|nt|h_karluk: 1s ap pretty interesting to me|pg||
nt|pelu: some would open 3@d in W|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's why i wondered|pg||
nt|djneill: I handed in one of those once and found we were up 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: say you hooked and failed, still @h loser there|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as kib suggested, if @c K is offside, there are 4 losers, but only 4|pg||
nt|mcarroll: or 2@D if weak|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|mcarroll: flat board|pg||
nt|h_karluk: almost carbon copy auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 4@d=bid your major, partner|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: I agree with several messages that pass by South was a logical alternative. These hesitation situations are always difficult.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Also, it's very easy to say that 5@d is a reasonable bid, because we can see the whole hand and know that the sacrifice is a paying one|pg||
nt|ludewig: of course that is our privilege :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the problem is, 5@d is a logical alternative as well. We all have our own opinions. The TD and Appeal Committee may have different ones.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ludewig: That's why we need them|pg||
pc|c6|nt|h_karluk: disagree that was not easy to retain control, kibber shld suggest ruff sluff, say lost hook and played another trump, where would you park @h losers?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d6|pc|c4|nt|ludewig: 3NT seems to be unbreakable, but East does not know Spade 10 comes down|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|sfoxa:  has he another options? after @d Q offside|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  double finess in @c, as we see|pg||
nt|ludewig: one could play for 4 diamond tricks (doubleton 10 or Q)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no play same result as that of OR and flat board.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|d4|nt|sfoxa:  @h finess allows limiting your losers to 2 @h, 1 @d and 1 @c|pg||
nt|ludewig: In the meantime Turkey has won Group A|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  is looks like the winner here is clear as well|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Russia has 15 - 15 befor last board|pg||
nt|ludewig: So East is playing for Spade 10 to come down or Diamond finesse|pg||
nt|ludewig: South ducked again, so  East may try diamonds after all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East has a few problems here|pg||
nt|ludewig: very tricky now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  too many options|pg||
nt|ludewig: and all reasonable|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: I use the silent moment to say thanks for watching|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: the next round will be the finals with 2x 12 boards|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ty Lukas for your hard job|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: Israel - Turkey|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thank you, Lukas. Excellent job |pg||
nt|ludewig: as one kib says, ducking Spade ace indicates that S has no club entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: next round we will also have a third vugraph table, which shows the womens final Germany - Russia (just Open Room)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good suggestion from kib - playing small @d now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  leaving all the options alive|pg||

nt|ady: part score hand   most of the strength with north and east|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: If I remember correctly, Izmir is a town in Turkey famous for making beautiful tiles. They are on display in many of the Istanbul mosques.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: The tiles are made in Iznik, I am told (from some tile specialists). So I was wrong. |pg||

nt|vugraphzkm: Zack asks, what pass means over the X|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: response: no 5 card suit or : i want to play that|pg||
