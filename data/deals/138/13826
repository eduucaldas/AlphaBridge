nt|ahollan1: I'm a cokaholic so can't even say his nickname|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: coke and pepsi|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|petergill: His name means bee in Polish|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: that was their nicknames|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|petergill: not necessarily a stinging bee|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: would have been funnier if it meant coke|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|an|begrudgingly|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|petergill: Lev, with a minimum with many queens and jacks, should pass, but can a rubber bridge player resist bidding game?|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes he can|pg||
nt|ahollan1: gotta love Barry's descriptors|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petergill: 3NT makes on the @D hook|pg||

mc|9|nt|petergill: It takes a while to download, but page 20 of http://worldbridge.org/publications/WBNews/WBFnews10.pdf has those World Rankings. |pg||

mb|p|mb|1D!|an|2+ 11-15 in theory|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15, 2+@D|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: he meets half the requirements|pg||
nt|petergill: Pepsi, first name Jacek (= Jack) is ranked  23 in the world. Obscure reference follows: Viewers of the TV Show Lost would think that is a coincidence. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C opening promises 6+ suit -- but in 3rd seat ....|pg||
mb|d|an|long thought|nt|vugraphzjf: Alerted on both sides|pg||
nt|petergill: Many pairs play 2@C as both majors on East's cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: writing on bboth sides|pg||
mb|r|nt|ahollan1: but Patnick not in on the joke yet, so trying Penalty DBL|pg||
nt|petergill: The Penalty Dbl is by a passed hand, so is fairly descriptive|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: not sure its penalties|pg||
nt|davidstern: Found this on the net Jacek is a Polish name; it's English equivalent is Hyacinth - suggest you dont call him Hyacinth|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|petergill: EW will be doubled, whatever they do|pg||
mb|2H|an|alerted|mb|d|nt|petergill: This NS pair likes very much to try for penalties. |pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 2@C 4+/5+ either way   some Big Clubbers even include 1=4=3=5|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: dbl showed majors I think|pg||

nt|petergill: @D2 might be "Smith Echo" to say "I don't have @SJ" or "I don't like spades, the suit you led" |pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: this 3 NT makes 14 opp 8  gotta love spot cards|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: good point Peter -- their 2009 Team Trials System Summary does say Smith vs NT|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|petergill: When Diamond opens 1@D in 3rd seat, don't play him for much. |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjf: auto trump lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: usually on this auction dummy has a stiff @s|pg||
pc|c8|nt|petergill: This is the one auction in bridge which screams for a trump lead, in case dummy has void or singleton in spades. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: other pairs in the event play the 2@C rebid as either Gazzilli or Bart|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|petergill: The choice of 1@C probably has suit pref overtones. |pg||

nt|ahollan1: i blame Kit Woolsey and his book on Partnership Defense for everything I know about suit preference|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: btw - the book is back in print|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Diam should have changed gears and tried for the tap with a @d shift|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|d9|nt|petergill: On the last day of the Reisinger a couple of years ago, I noticed that almost every opponent I played had the "suit pref in trumps" and "Smith Echo" boxes ticked on their ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Convention Cards. At lower levels of expertise, those boxes are less commonly ticked. |pg||

pc|s8|pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: now you'll see an increased number of Reverse Smith|pg||
pc|d2|pc|sA|pg||
mc|9|nt|petergill: I meant "the choice of @C8" as opening lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same principal as upside down signals|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: closing  next round Woolsey Martel so we can learn about Suit Preference and hamman Compton so we can learn about 3NT contracts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe|pg||
