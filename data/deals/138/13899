pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||

nt|xenya: well the defence might not be ideal... |pg||
nt|copeyj: but playing weak jump shifts, i don't see that you can not bid it on most hands 4-8 HCP with 6@H - maybe if you had truly terrible @H but..|pg||

pc|h9|nt|xenya: good shift|pg||

nt|h_karluk: slammish|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nice solution by Lukas:) a magician|pg||
nt|mdgraham: suspect 4@S will be bid at the other table as well, and, as we have seen, the "best" defence is by no means easy  |pg||
nt|djneill: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: light opening at 1st seat|pg||
nt|yuval10: another interesting hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: how many @s's from S now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5 ok|pg||

mb|p|nt|desert: Good evening|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Martin|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning/afternoon all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: double here looks like a Raptor-style thing - major/minor two-suirer|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello to all, welcome to join last RR round of Bonn Nations|pg||
nt|yuval10: probably P 1@s 2@h|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@d even|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: it could be that the score is not correct, because 21:14 is the score after 11 boards|pg||
nt|yuval10: P 1@d P 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  hello, Martin|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I am surprised that W passes in this position|pg||
nt|desert: the german pair at this table play a straightforward precision base with a 10-12 NT Nvul|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Rather than bid a competitive 3@S|pg||
nt|yuval10: she even|pg||
nt|pelu: its is not a light opening: 1@D = 9+ and 4 card|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|desert: Facing a 10-12 NT 3 Sp looks more risky :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: would've been better to overcall 1 as it turns out|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: hello and welcome|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Yes I thought it should have been bid and conveyed it.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, E had maximum and 4 cards fit - only 2 @s ? |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello Sveta, Mike and Bernard|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and to operator Lukas|pg||
nt|ludewig: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: we had technical problems, so we start in bbo with board 14|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if ddl was major/minor, would have expected 2@h if that was pass/coreect|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcarroll: Following the Law nonvul in particular I would bid 3@S|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sfoxa:  anyway, N has to be magician to bring this game home |pg||
pc|hA|nt|sfoxa:  Israel takes lead in his group, where France is 5th with big gap to second place (qualified for finals)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|s5|nt|h_karluk: classic nat sys isnt 12+?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: not "he" but "she", all women here at the table...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ladies around, ahem :)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: if you play these style tings, you have to work out your pass/correct bids, and work out which ones are natural  |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: only two to qualify?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|ludewig: I suppose X simply showed one minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: sorry sveta, but just the first in every group qualifies to the finals|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's a tough qualification|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  only one? sorry and thank you for correction|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|pelu: CC: 9+|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|c9|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|s8|nt|vugraphzkk: one final with 2x 12 boards|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if so, then only Israel and Russia have chances in this group|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: the rest is playing swiss system|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would choose pass as West, i don't think singleton @cK good enough, secondly i don't have 6 baggers|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Unless N follows the Rabbi's Law and drops the sigleton @C K this will be several off, and even so has only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|djneill: here, North had a choice between a takeout double of 1@c, and 1NT with a good doubleton|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|h_karluk: brown sticker?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sfoxa:  margin between them is big enough 104 - 121 as you can see here: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC_2010/10_05_12_dma.html|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3rdly i only have ugly 8 HCP|pg||
nt|desert: Well 3 @S would have been down 1 probably. Now East West will get a plus score....|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|rnmalik: Good shift to 10@S and back to @C and declarer has no problem now.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ludewig: West is trying to find a layout that avoids the spade loser|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Such is life - such is bridge?|pg||

nt|vugraphzkm: notice, that the current score is 14-46, not 14-38. Will be hard for Izmir to come back|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|copeyj: the 3@S overcall from the auction in the closed room was "not a thing of beauty"|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|an|asking|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I suppose nonvul he was looking for a profitable save - might have found an enormous penlaty :)|pg||
mb|4C|an|4!hs with max|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|copeyj: some people are defending it, saying he knows he needed a swing etc|pg||
nt|copeyj: I think on the whole that approach is losing bridge - especially when you have gone into a 12 board set only a few imps down effectively|pg||
nt|xenya: not an easy contract|pg||
nt|copeyj: you never know what is going on next door - even if you feel you are having not a great set, your teammates might be doing really good|pg||
nt|cuttysark: One problem with saving is that you are assuming 4@H will make - and declarer has no reason to finesse hearts that I can see|pg||
nt|copeyj: and if you lose the match "swinging"|pg||
nt|copeyj: then it crucifies teammates|pg||
nt|copeyj: can make this now anyway|pg||
nt|copeyj: but|pg||
pc|d2|nt|copeyj: declarer has to decide|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He could win this and take 2 club finesses to pitch a spade|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes - has decided to run the @D though - A@S now from Pachtmann I am sure|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|copeyj: no reason as Liz said for declarer to guess @H|pg||
nt|xenya: now it boils down to the @H guess|pg||
pc|hK|mc|9|pg||
qx|c15|st||md|1SQTHAKJ42DQJ94C76,SK763H5DT653CKT82,S82H9863DA82CAQJ9,SAJ954HQT7DK7C543|sv|n|nt|sfoxa:  as for me, bridge is the best mirror of life I've ever seen|pg||
nt|djneill: should be a flat board, give or take a trick, no?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: th issue abt to bid what you see own hand, while you do not have an idea abt others holdings|pg||
nt|yuval10: np|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like a quite game here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the most important that they are not - undo is available for you|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: likely a part score for NS|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Agree.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|3S|nt|yuval10: that's some 3@s by E|pg||
nt|yuval10: now the way for a 4@s sacrifice is open|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sfoxa:  you can play as a Deep Finess all the boards - but what does it matters, if next door defenders apply DBL and allow overtricks... |pg||
mb|4S|nt|djneill: South does not play support XX to show 3 spades, but North will reveal the @d fit so it is moot|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they will probably end in 3@d|pg||
nt|yuval10: or maybe not...|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: The Ladies competition is much closer than the Open - 4 teams witin 5 VPs |pg||
nt|yuval10: S might try 2NT here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: perhaps everybody picked hard way, indeed rare and unusual|pg||
nt|ludewig: Could end in 2 Spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: some play here that over 2@d by North, if East doubles again, it shows "good @c raise"|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lead directing in "white" against red |pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: while 3@c is "bad @c raise"|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Anything beyond 2@C would be a minus score for EW.|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's more like it|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|sfoxa:  actually, not so dramatic. but somethings like this :-)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but unless S starts with 2N not comfortable for 3N|pg||
nt|ludewig: S has 6 losers|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perhaps 2@s by South at his third turn would show a stronger hand |pg||
nt|yuval10: in 4@h declarer need to guess the @h's which isn't so likely|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mcarroll: and as my partner says - in teams there is no such contract as 2NT it is either 1 or 3|pg||
nt|ludewig: most pairs pay this as stronger indeed and some tend to raise spades immediately with a weak hand and 3 cards|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  popular agreement indeed. but this time, S's hand isn't strong enough. must have 15-17, I suppose|pg||
nt|yuval10: after def. starts with 2@s's and a @s|pg||
nt|yuval10: @d even|pg||
pc|c8|nt|h_karluk: i ve no idea N bought tho knows 18-19 there, cannot see any extras or much cover cards|pg||
nt|yuval10: W will do best to duck it|pg||
nt|pelu: N hope for a 5 card @C by pd|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just a balanced 4423 with an Ace and 2 J|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c may be only a three-card suit - if \ West had a 4333 shape, for example|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and now declarer has to guess @s for -500 only|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh i forgot to add 2 tens, lol|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  this time 3NT is far better|pg||
pc|dK|nt|djneill: that's true, would be risky adventure to bid to 3-level vulnerable with 13-15 combined HCP|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|pelu: need "just" Hx in @cs by west|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: after this board i will make a short restart of bbo, because the scores are not transfered into the open-room :(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|s3|pc|h3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  np|pg||
nt|ludewig: West has everything under control|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|sfoxa:  his @s return followed by @c when in with @h ace will promote trump trick for defence|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d8|nt|djneill: West here would love to attack the long @c suit, but an unsupported Ace is a no-no at suits|pg||
pc|s5|pc|dJ|nt|ludewig: East shows Club entry with Spade 3|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and now drums beating|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we'll see what will appear from that empty hat|pg||
nt|pelu: the real chance was to play on @Cs - this plan only work if mistake by opp|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and teeth gnashing|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|djneill: so @h was the best of bad choices|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ludewig: and again with Club 8, standard carding as all French play it|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h9|pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: and, thanks to NS's abysmal failure to play Support Doubles, East has no idea how strong West is for 2@c  |pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: last time i remember opps were busy trying to find a way to kill my contract, i dont see any logical reason to expect opps subterfuge|pg||

nt|h_karluk: with 18? interesting, are we talking about von arnim?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still no game for either direction|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so raising to 3@c is rather risky |pg||

nt|pelu: Yes - same start, but over !NT by N she passed with her 18 - remember that 1@C not naturel by Auken-von Arnim|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very tricky boards.|pg||
nt|yuval10: which is also approved by one of the players who's kibitzing here|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2S|nt|yuval10: so add 8 imps to Israel's score|pg||
mb|d|nt|mcarroll: but an interesting part score debate|pg||
mb|2N|nt|djneill: 2@d here is a R-M'ish transfer showing 5+@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@d=hearts, by the look of it|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: tough rebid problem|pg||
mb|3S|nt|h_karluk: oh got it|pg||
nt|djneill: borrowed from scandinavians no doubt|pg||
nt|djneill: wow, into the fire|pg||
mb|3N|nt|h_karluk: i guess both sides would try to dictate and finally agree abt 3N|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT might go down for some numbers here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: there are some partnerships in England - well, I can think of one - for whom almost every bid is a transfer  |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Hi again: by system EW open on 9+|pg||
nt|djneill: I have my mail sent next door and it gets transferred to me|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|nt|mcarroll: True Hamdi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I liked 2@s - 3@d would shows extras|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so am I|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *show|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sfoxa:  if after my 3@c partner bids 3NT - I feel uncomfortable|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would anybody here plays 2@s as last resort over 1@h?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sfoxa:  now is the other story. but hardly with happy-end|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sfoxa:  oh, I'm wrong - this time declarer prevails|pg||
nt|djneill: now we could have a promotion in @c |pg||
nt|djneill: North trying to work out whether going for ruffs will work better than giving a promotion (ruffing just once by North does nothing since it is a natural trick)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: regarding the previous board, it is often said that every convention comes with a price. Support (re)Doubles are all very well, but they do allow the opponents the option of ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bid/pass, as opposed to (as we saw) bid, of possibly indeterminate strength |pg||
nt|djneill: true|pg||
nt|djneill: so North could play a spade, ruff, @d, ruff, @c, promotion|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That is true and the agreement between partnerships foremost.|pg||
nt|djneill: but if North ruffs too much, now it is South's ruff that does not gain a trick :-)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. The Support route has the advantage of establishing the degree of fit early, which may well be important if the auction gets competitive.|pg||
nt|djneill: I have never tried to be much of a bidding theorist with geniuses above me doing the good work and testing, so if they play something, I play it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but by that time NS may have enough ruffs to defeat the contract |pg||
nt|djneill: since at IMPs the goal is to set the contract first, and get undertricks second, I think North is just imagining all the scenarios that matter, not this particular one (always ...|pg||
nt|djneill: down)|pg||
nt|djneill: for instance, East could have 3 @h|pg||
nt|djneill: South could have @cQJ and North may underlead the @cK :-(|pg||
nt|djneill: the unsupported Q lead is so rare, this might actually happen after a @s ruff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, it's hard to imagine in defence that the opposition are on a 5-1 fit|pg||
nt|djneill: South should deliver a @s ruff with a high @s for a high suit pref (@d)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS can cash lot of @h, but...|pg||
nt|yuval10: 7 tricks for declarer now|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk7: Israel has 8 IMPs more than shown on the scoreboard. Sorry, but we can't rectify that any longer|pg||
nt|Walddk7: We just have to keep it in mind|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I am sure Yuval can keep track :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 29-14 is the official score|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sfoxa:  even without @d continuation, N can take 9 tricks. now it's much more easier|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe the question could be in case 3@h rebid scenario would N decide to 3N or not|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes the @D continuation makes it easier|pg||
nt|djneill: the @s2 should be a singleton, no?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: for me yes.|pg||
nt|djneill: Poles would scoff|pg||
nt|djneill: I don't hear any scoffing|pg||
nt|po-s: if they play Polish he might have a doubleton|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after king-ace at the previous trick, South would surely lead the queen if he had it.|pg||
nt|djneill: lol just saw the 6@c contract|pg||

nt|vugraphzkk: East started the auction with 1@s without passed North...|pg||

nt|h_karluk: but finallt a game there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: got it ty Lukas|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|h_karluk: 2@s pretty much interesting call|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if E risked an overcall with his hand, W is allowed to bid game|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC_2010/10_05_12_dma.html  for live scores and standings|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: even I, as vugraph operator, I'm tired yet ;-)|pg||
nt|djneill: ok not a victory for the transfer, but West would have probably bid 2@h with that hand even without transfers|pg||
mb|p|nt|ludewig: Hi everyone again, now with scores from the Open Room|pg||
nt|djneill: ok, and on brd 2 in other room, South with 7 opposite a 15-18 NT used an invite sequence to get to game|pg||
mb|2S|nt|h_karluk: i believe you operator, however so far so good, woohoo, go go go , we need you@H :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  operator's job is much more complicated - you have noc chance to be "dummy" |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkk: thats right Sveta...|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ludewig: It's been a long time I have seen an invitational 3@D raise|pg||
nt|yuval10: Israel gain 11 imps on board 13|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|yuval10: leading now by 26|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  I was in your shoes once. thereafter I do prefer commenting :-)|pg||

nt|pelu: when N pass - then no harm bidding goes on|pg||
nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and nice fast arrival|pg||
nt|mcarroll: as Yuval said - a boring 4@S - with or without TD|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: i think, nothing problematic happens here...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  all new things are good forgotten old ones|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, it's not as though EW can make very much - the hands don't fit well|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: WBF rules i suppose|pg||
nt|pelu: I see 4½ loser, so not so boring :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: did you read Yuval :)|pg||
nt|pelu: no Harmi - standard rules|pg||
nt|djneill: any chances to make this?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|ludewig: worked out perfectly on this hand|pg||

pc|s2|nt|djneill: West really stepped out with a muckraking double|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|rnmalik: 3@H and a @S|pg||
nt|djneill: East stepped out too with no "constructive" sequence like Lebensohl|pg||

nt|ludewig: 130 or 150 to EW|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mcarroll: In My opinion - and experience - the operator's job is the hardest, stuck between players who play either too fast or too slow, dont reveal their cards - when they make a mistake ...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: try to hide everything, and commentators who are asking for information you just dont have! |pg||
pc|s6|pc|d4|nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
nt|djneill: ok so @c played the right way, North would have the Jxxx if anyone (South having 6@s-2@h)|pg||

mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  this board isn't so easy|pg||
nt|sfoxa:   seeing all 4 hand, I'd land in 3@c by NS. but...|pg||
mb|4S|nt|h_karluk: 2D another special treatment|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so Multi defense could be th issue|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if it's Multy - i can adore such openings|pg||
nt|yuval10: the system works here, i think it's the 3rd hand that either E or W has 11 points and open|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now 25/15 there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: actually, no chance for 3NT, sorry - didn't see that North had five hearts|pg||
nt|djneill: well, played from East I can see it|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: W pushed to 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: u can find a lot of Convention Cards on : http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/systems.asp|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: seems not original but kind of invention|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite reasonably|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next day he'll be right. not today|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|h_karluk: not much fancy or academic decision, just landed swiftly|pg||
nt|mcarroll: the simple way is often the best way|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks to Peter provided excellent ideas to see their way|pg||
nt|h_karluk: agreed Martin|pg||
nt|djneill: with both major suit stoppers an issue, East bid 3@s to SHOW the stopper, and DENY the @h stopper, I guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: guess so|pg||
nt|yuval10: but they seem to have 4 losers|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sfoxa:  good reason for W to bid - he has values to add to each minor|pg||
pc|c5|nt|h_karluk: it's good to see new ideas in th laboratory|pg||
nt|ludewig: North might find heart queen after the bidding|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  side Ace-King - not so much for own play, but too much for defence. If partner decided to preempt - he will be surprised by the values |pg||
nt|h_karluk: this time NS lucky that S doesn't have 3 pieces spades - say E void in @s, would be funny|pg||
nt|mcarroll: For me it is a standard Multi|pg||
pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: 16 HCP in bag, say minimum 10 hcp overcall, then what, i liked her decision.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: Last match today in 1 hour and 5 minutes: Netherlands W vs Germany W|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then that's not the way i played. ie either weak 6 cards M or 2N with any 5 cards suit or 4441 any with 17+ |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sfoxa:  if in game - it's necessary|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  without @d swith|pg||
nt|ludewig: in 3 also, 3 more losers in Diamonds an Spades|pg||
nt|ludewig: after a diamond switch certainly, now maybe not|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: entry and communication problem - I exp @DA and @C to 8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes transportation problems arose|pg||
nt|pelu: if she play low (the safe way) she has problem wuth communication|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still looking for a possible endplay, this one hard to see|pg||
nt|pelu: she can also play @d7 and later @cs from top - but @S from East will break communication|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh i think she makes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bet South guesses the clubs|pg||
nt|djneill: ballsy 5@c with all that red stuff|pg||
pc|h5|nt|h_karluk: clubs create enough pressure|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|pelu: not easy for Pasman|pg||
pc|c6|nt|h_karluk: that's true|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I do hope, E could have been more conscious defending vs. 4@h|pg||
nt|ludewig: checking EW carding|pg||

mb|3H|nt|h_karluk: *have|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 4@c indeed very courageous decision|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  after partner revealed 18 points? quite normal|pg||
nt|h_karluk: remember please, passed to 1@s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 1@h then spades would give better info <responder reverse>|pg||
nt|h_karluk: moreover could be an early fit on @h suit|pg||
nt|ludewig: of course|pg||
nt|mdgraham: likely heart lead will solve one problem|pg||
mb|4H|nt|h_karluk: this may upset |pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: and there it is...|pg||
nt|ludewig: I expect 11 tricks, losing 2 spades after a club ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: defense even|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  interesting question. @c ruff avoid you from taking 2 @s tricks, @s Q return prevent @c ruff (((|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: one step too far|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the problem there you can never know if there's 3 pieces @h support with that approach|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yuval10: so probably as you said, @c to the A follow by small @s, hopping declarer will put the K|pg||
nt|yuval10: but declarer should read it - with A@s E would've played @c ruff in 2nd trick|pg||
pc|cK|nt|h_karluk: bloody board, obv 5@c fails esp after @h K lead, surprised to lead and no double there|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@C = checkback-stayman|pg||
nt|h_karluk: or nmf|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@H = forcing 5-5 in major|pg||
pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: also your partner may recognize 5/4 very good |pg||
nt|h_karluk: for now  club pitch fine|pg||
nt|h_karluk: two way @h Q hook, problems abt entry to hand, not a happily 3N tho prsopects seems not much bleak|pg||
nt|mcarroll: or @H pitch|pg||
nt|pelu: difff lead for West - she know that S is 2-2-5-4 - but what to lead?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would rather save that @h|pg||

nt|rnmalik: 6@D better who so ever plays-whereas N has to be the declarer at 6NT.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: of course, on this sort of hand, it is easy to lock into spades - let's see|pg||
nt|djneill: hmm, North's hand just improved, the @hK went from half a trick to a almost a full trick|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|h_karluk: I guess 2C invite or better on comp|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so over X classic sys on|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 1@h fake suit, maybe 1N different range|pg||
nt|h_karluk: wonder alert to 1@h also or not|pg||
nt|mcarroll: or maybe 1@D shows @Hs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be, saw similar samples|pg||
nt|pelu: would u bid 2@H? - @sK in front of opener - I would pass |pg||
nt|h_karluk: auto pass|pg||
nt|djneill: ah yes, it's slam time|pg||
nt|djneill: South is short in @c, where East has strength, so North's strength is not as much wasted as it could be|pg||
mb|3D|nt|h_karluk: 5 HCP, sorry partner|pg||
nt|pelu: almost only 2 Jacks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i dont wanna toss barriers|pg||

mb|p|nt|yuval10: this might be interesting|pg||
nt|yuval10: leading by 41 now|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ludewig: so this must have been invitational or even forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3@c doesn't improve North's hand though|pg||
nt|djneill: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: although he could bid 4@D. He has already shown spade support.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but still, this is a hard slam to get to.|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|mcarroll: Interesting - esp with singleton @C A|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  E's hand is worth an invite, but I'd prefer to hear 4@h from partner|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT from East was a winning bid|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|h_karluk: so half of natural half relays, i didnt see any difference except nat bidders would rebid 1N and S offers 2N then all pass|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ludewig: 4 diamonds, 3 Hearts and two black tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sfoxa:  yes, 10@s matters|pg||
nt|ludewig: but not clear to West which entry North has|pg||
nt|ludewig: if Clubs first he goes down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: even then has 11 tricks unless A@C is played.|pg||
nt|yuval10: as it seem like 4@s is going down|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ludewig: well done|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even now, @c return from S looks dangerous|pg||
nt|ludewig: If North had held both heart king and club ace, you need to play club imediately|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sfoxa:  does S consider to duck?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: here in this group it seems to be clear, that israel get on 1st place, but in th other group there are just 2 VP between the first and the 4th place now!|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  attempt for 5@s?|pg||

nt|vugraphzkk: so Martin is right...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true|pg||

pc|c9|nt|sfoxa:  to be proven by excellent defence now|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *mixed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but that would be my last wish to play 3N after i employed cbs or nmf whatever with a stiff|pg||
nt|pelu: with @D8 7 - defense cant take 4 @D-tricks - so @c5 now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mcarroll: No guarantee of a @H fit - or break, and game points - Hamman says if 3NT is an option - bid it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Who am I to disagree|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sfoxa:  in 2@h - rather 1 down, if not more|pg||

pc|s8|nt|yuval10: will finesse @s now|pg||

pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: in one of my partnerships we use the Meckstroth-Rodwell method - double by North would mean "I'm not sure what to do"  - South would (imho) bid 5@s with an eight-carder|pg||

mb|3N|nt|pelu: 6-12 is a wide range, I prefer 3@C = 10-12, and 3@D = 7-9|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 3D normal in my book, anyways not sure abt 4D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4NT from South, one suspects|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless Norht gets there first |pg||
nt|ludewig: he is thinking about it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, after partner's free bid |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Q - would 5@d from South show longer diamonds?|pg||
nt|ludewig: and West might take the push to 5 Spades|pg||
nt|djneill: there it was helpful that North was declaring, and had not shown 4 spades yet, West had no chance I think|pg||
mb|4C|nt|yuval10: and is a good spot from N|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: agreed Peter, that was the way we played on OKB 97-2000|pg||

nt|h_karluk: so we all dislike that wide range|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|ludewig: 4 Imps if down 500|pg||
nt|ludewig: and 8 if 300|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If there was any slowness about the screen coming through, South can infer that it was North who was thinking. It was unlikely to have been West. So maybe there could be some ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ethical constraints. Even so, South has a reasonable 5@D bid.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Just as a matter of inteest, what would 1NT mean in that style?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|Walddk6: Welcome back to Vladimir Ivanov|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I suppose 3NT by South might just make if West got off to the wring lead|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d7|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cuttysark: Or even the wrong lead |pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|mc|10|nt|xenya: hardly, if W leads a @D honour -- and why not?|pg||
pg||
qx|c23|st||md|1SJHAQJ6DJ98CAK974,SA974HT5DAKT764C2,SQ52HK42DQ53CQJ65,SKT863H9873D2CT83|sv|b|nt|h_karluk: there were a bait and hard to shut the mouth|pg||
nt|pelu: not the best defense - I exp 12 IMPs for Germany here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: allrite, th penultimate board on th way|pg||
nt|djneill: the double holdup in @h would have been quite deep|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sfoxa:  must admit, declarer gave a chance with @c ace|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h position helped|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agreed - but I doubt if we will be making up any Appeal Committee|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS will be quite pleased with the look of their card|pg||
nt|djneill: yeah|pg||
mb|1D|nt|h_karluk: 2D in a good day?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: plus scores good, minus scores bad|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW seem to be able to make 3@s here, so maybe some imps for Izmir|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: he was busy to find ways to get rid of his @h loser|pg||
nt|djneill: yeah, what a formidable line of plus scores|pg||
nt|yuval10: hard to see the @s suit come into action though|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: if somebody is interested in the fact, why the open room is not more in vugraph: the computer finished with a bluescreen :(|pg||
mb|2N|nt|h_karluk: 1s ap pretty interesting to me|pg||
nt|pelu: some would open 3@d in W|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's why i wondered|pg||
nt|djneill: I handed in one of those once and found we were up 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: say you hooked and failed, still @h loser there|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as kib suggested, if @c K is offside, there are 4 losers, but only 4|pg||
nt|mcarroll: or 2@D if weak|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: flat board|pg||
nt|h_karluk: almost carbon copy auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: @s lead will give defense 7 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: 4@d=bid your major, partner|pg||
nt|yuval10: however....|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mdgraham: I agree with several messages that pass by South was a logical alternative. These hesitation situations are always difficult.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not impossible contract - if W after winning @d doesn't shift to @s|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: Also, it's very easy to say that 5@d is a reasonable bid, because we can see the whole hand and know that the sacrifice is a paying one|pg||
nt|ludewig: of course that is our privilege :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the problem is, 5@d is a logical alternative as well. We all have our own opinions. The TD and Appeal Committee may have different ones.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ludewig: That's why we need them|pg||
pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: disagree that was not easy to retain control, kibber shld suggest ruff sluff, say lost hook and played another trump, where would you park @h losers?|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|po-s: a threatening dummy|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  no more hope |pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|d9|pg||
nt|ludewig: 3NT seems to be unbreakable, but East does not know Spade 10 comes down|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yuval10: that's unfortunate Lukas|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  has he another options? after @d Q offside|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  double finess in @c, as we see|pg||
nt|ludewig: one could play for 4 diamond tricks (doubleton 10 or Q)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rnmalik: no play same result as that of OR and flat board.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s7|nt|yuval10: well, one trick was lost for the def. but still -2|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @h finess allows limiting your losers to 2 @h, 1 @d and 1 @c|pg||
nt|ludewig: In the meantime Turkey has won Group A|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  is looks like the winner here is clear as well|pg||
nt|yuval10: and 8 imps|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sfoxa:  Russia has 15 - 15 befor last board|pg||
nt|ludewig: So East is playing for Spade 10 to come down or Diamond finesse|pg||
nt|ludewig: South ducked again, so  East may try diamonds after all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East has a few problems here|pg||
nt|ludewig: very tricky now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  too many options|pg||
nt|ludewig: and all reasonable|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: I use the silent moment to say thanks for watching|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: the next round will be the finals with 2x 12 boards|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ty Lukas for your hard job|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: Israel - Turkey|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thank you, Lukas. Excellent job |pg||
nt|ludewig: as one kib says, ducking Spade ace indicates that S has no club entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: next round we will also have a third vugraph table, which shows the womens final Germany - Russia (just Open Room)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good suggestion from kib - playing small @d now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  leaving all the options alive|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: no worries, the vugraph operator did not felt asleep ;-)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|yuval10: actually this "missed" undertrick was worth 2 imps|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
mc|7|nt|ludewig: I think Diamond from the top and if nothing happens Club 9|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|cuttysark: Well, he has to switch to @SA, playing South for the singleton honour. Possible, I agree, but not trivial|pg||
nt|copeyj: not the most strenuous of deals - can make 6 if you drop the @SK|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||

nt|djneill: whoa, East is 4-3+ majors, and South redoubles?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: redouble interesting shot|pg||

nt|djneill: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: VERY strong hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  best thanks to Hamdi and Martin - nice evening in your company|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pelu: in board 10 the first 2 tricks for defense was the black A'es - so 4@S sh go down - and a lot of imps for Germany |pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php kibbers always welcomed, have fun guys:)|pg||
nt|djneill: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Lukas, don't forget to drink a cold beer during break for us also :) good luck in Ladies event|pg||

nt|vugraphzkk: there are no X-cards in his bidding box left ;-)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  o, sorry, I'm too fast, indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: :) he can borrow some from South|pg||
nt|djneill: West feels he has already overbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: exchange double for redouble cards :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: also our pleasure, anytime @H |pg||
nt|mdgraham: South has probably run out of redouble cards-  there aren't too many of those in a standard bididng box|pg||
nt|djneill: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: here we have the other room|pg||
nt|yuval10: 6@s on a finesse here|pg||

pc|dK|nt|pelu: 2@D = 9-11 - so west didn't wont to bid again|pg||
