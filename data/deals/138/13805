nt|dburn:  but may help them towards 6@c, which is not a bad contract|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|vugraphzjf: On this day a very good contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Played by North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if any of the specs can translate the auction starting with 2N --   H E L P|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D!|nt|vugraphzjf: Sorry my Norwegian is very limited|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N!|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: best guesses so far  3@D=5@H   2N is game force, but not sure if it said anything about @C [probably not]|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: I have just uploaded a photo. Helness places his cards on the table and folds his hands behind his head deep in thought http://cavendishinvitational.com/webcam/2/table2.jpg|pg||
nt|poohbear: My guess is 2NT was @cs |pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Here is a better hoto of him contemplating http://cavendishinvitational.com/webcam/2/table2.jpg|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've had one spec agree 2N=@C and 3@D=3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: staring to the heavens for inspiration|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i always sought inspiration from the other direction -- don't tell anybody though|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: I was just asked why there is a calculator next to him (theh) that is a bridgemate unit for sending the scores directly to the scoring room|pg||
nt|dburn:  6NT is not a good contract, but it will probably make|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: A new picture his lips are moving as he tries to count out all the possibilities|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjf: 2NT showed a strong hand with  four spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room  Casen-Passell never got past 3N +690|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's 1 losing finesse and 1 winning finess -- stay tuned for the other 2 finesses|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: hese aredefining hands in this event where you are scored against every other pair sitting in the same direction|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maximum imps per hand is 17 times 22 [the number of comparisons]|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Declarer can go wrong here by !AH ace and ruff a heart and ope trumps break|pg||
nt|poohbear: he wont do that|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Maximum loss is 24 imps x 22|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dburn:  he won't go wrong if he does|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sK|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: A diamond now will kill dummy|pg||
nt|poohbear: no|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|dburn:  but he will probably just try to ruff a spade in dummy|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|poohbear: tight|pg||
nt|poohbear: right|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: But declarer in good shape spade ten drops squeezes but must take a second trump finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looking at all hands --- East can be squeezed in majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that seems unlikely single dummy play|pg||
nt|dburn:  and repeat the club finesse, hoping that East isn't doing something very deep|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|poohbear: I think declarer just ruffs a @s now and repeats the trump finesse|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|cJ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: too right specs -- east protects @D too|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|cA|mc|12|nt|poohbear: he would never duck the trump looking at the @s king|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but this line MUCH better|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: typical H &H auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Helness aplogising for monopolising the time on the first board|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Yes 23 points 3NT but when a hand opens that is worth a few points in card placement capabilities|pg||
nt|poohbear: Dont see how they make this one|pg||
nt|dburn:  not an attractive lead for West|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: That said dont see how defence get theeir tricks either|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: passive is probably good here but what is passive|pg||
nt|poohbear: defense in theory have 2 @h and 3 aces|pg||
nt|ahollan1: again more bidding here   Passell passed 1N|pg||
pc|c2|nt|poohbear: maybe there's a medium course between the actions at each table :)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|poohbear: a glimmer of hope for declarer? maybe the defense will give him a second @c trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Carding asks Helgie - Standard responds Thomas|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: I am thinking (only thinking mind you) that I would rather back declarer than defenders|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm thinking -- will this table get to board 9?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Not any time soon|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: nice shift from young Thomas|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: West should Win this and play @HK and with the @CJ as an entry|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|vugraphzjf: Thomas is a sensational bridge talent|pg||

nt|vugraphzjf: Last and we are in grace time|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Michel passes outt of turn|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: oy|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: And shares a smile with Helness|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: This  hand will be speed bridge|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: good thing on same side of screen as Tor|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: and NS control|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Passing out of turn with screens is no problem|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjf: A double would be most unpleasant|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|poohbear: First offense is a warning for late play then the penalties kick in. Warnings do not carry over session to session|pg||

mc|8|nt|ahollan1: Helness gets to decide which Bessis takes last 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what a brutal set of hands that was|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Both sides arguing about who owns the time warning - graciously saying it was themselves or shared i.e. arguing against their interests|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Close and reopen coming|pg||
