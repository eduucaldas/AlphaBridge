nt|davidstern: And Multon is an exceptionally fine player|pg||
nt|davidstern: But let's not understimate the skills of Zimmermann himself|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Greco-Hampson Precision base  Zimmermann-Multon Natural|pg||
nt|davidstern: He can certainly play very well|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|petergill: For security reasons, posting of scores seems to be delayed in the Cavendish, possibly to minimise the chance of pairs who drop out of contention not trying as hard as possible, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: with so much money at stake. |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjf: I would bid 3@c cause I want to get to 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: with West|pg||
nt|petergill: That's one explanation of why we have only overnight scores. For tomorrow's fifth and final session, there's big sessional prizemoney for the same reason. |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|davidstern: Scores for session three should be posted|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and interesting situation being able to own part of an opponent|pg||
nt|davidstern: By now am chasin up|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Zimmermann owns half the field|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes Barry Goren and I wont operate where Casen/Passell are playing as we have an interest|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: we would but they dont let us!|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond owns many pairs too|pg||
nt|davidstern: Zimmermann owns much less than people think. Firstly he and Zaleski are in some form of partnership and he has sold down almost all pairs down to less than 30% of the pair involved|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Multon shows his hnad|pg||
mc|11|pg||

mb|1D!|an|2+ less than strong !c|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15, 2+@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|davidstern: Splinter?|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|petergill: He didn't cover @DQ - I think because he didn't want ace, @D to jack, third @D for possible uppercut with a singleton trump (but @S can be thrown on that anyway)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|davidstern: The organisers also change opponents based on pairs owning interests in other pairs so that they play earlier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C probably specifically a VOID|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: not sure I like splinter with such weak trumps|pg||
nt|davidstern: Agree|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjf: Hampson knows what to lead!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|po-s: oops this might become expensive|pg||
nt|davidstern: This is many down|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h9|nt|davidstern: As noted spades plays better for N/S than E/W|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|petergill: This might go up to 5 light. |pg||
nt|davidstern: Somebody notes slam cold but who was getting there|pg||
pc|d8|nt|davidstern: And 1100 may be more than 980|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and without seeing ew hands -- terrible slam|pg||
nt|petergill: Almost nobody - slam needs a miracle trump position for a start. |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|davidstern: The spade 8 is a cute card - allows North to ruff one club and put declarer to the sword on fourth round of diamonds|pg||
nt|po-s: a normal Roland slam|pg||
nt|petergill: He does best to ruff partner's winner, doesn't he?|pg||
nt|davidstern: I dont know there is a whole new language here - I cant use the F (Flannery) word but we now have Roland slams|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ruff is best|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: defense timed it poorly. Needed to give @c ruff first|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|s8|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H9 shows @DA|pg||
pc|c4|nt|po-s: nono David|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am told salm is 12.79% leave you to check|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|petergill: The last time I ruffed partner's winner to gain a trick (in 2009), my partner gave me a stern reprimand after the hand was over. |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so right to play @D if South did not hold @DK|pg||
nt|davidstern: So 800 - I would take that sitting N/S|pg||
mc|5|nt|vugraphzjf: 1100|pg||
pg||

nt|po-s: Peter we can see what a stern reprimand is worth|pg||
nt|davidstern: Sorry 1100 and I am told 12.79% is the requirement for a Roland slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|davidstern: Or less I assume|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: woolsey playing standard [sort of] rebid 3@H so tame 4@H my Martel in North|pg||
nt|davidstern: Great thing about this tournament is you dont have to explain the 1100 to team mates|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: some French muttered in the direction of Zimmermann after the hand|pg||
nt|petergill: I think this analysis is correct ...if @H9 was discouraging, thus @HK was offside, and West could have saved a trick by going up with @HA, after the @d winner was not ruffed.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just to owner -- who is Zimmermann|pg||
nt|davidstern: Rubbish - it wasnt muttered it was much more than muttered - I heard it from my room|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Director here. Hampson misscored brd 11|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|davidstern: I thought was only 800|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 11: "All dames (queen) and jacks, you shouldn't bid" is the best translation I can make of West's French|pg||
