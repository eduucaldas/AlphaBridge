mb|1N|nt|flash: IMPs compared across the field|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|flash: @Ds and a major|pg||
nt|jcmax: 2@D probably showing @D+major|pg||
mb|2H|nt|flash: pass or correct|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|jcmax: It has become a very propular convention in the US|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  it may become less so if East passes this|pg||
nt|flash: welcome to David Burn|pg||
nt|jcmax: hi david|pg||
mb|2N|nt|flash: also, we've heard rumors of another PO Sundelin sighting...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|po-s: another?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|flash: at least one a decade, no?    :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|po-s: one is more than enough|pg||
nt|jcmax: It doesn't look easy for declarer to arrive at 8 tricks here|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|flash: a most polite way to suggest down 1?   (would we expect anything else from Sabine??)|pg||
nt|jcmax: He can find the doubleton 1SA and the @HK is also onside, but that is still only 7 tricks. Can he find an 8th?|pg||
nt|dburn:  they might have arrived at somewhere close to eight tricks against 2@h doubled, but not here|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|jcmax: I am not sure 2@H doubled would have been such a disaster. Thedefendeers all the time have to play someting for declarer|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, if the defenders are on lead all the time, that is not necessarily good news for declarer|pg||
nt|dburn:  but I agree, it would not necessarily have been a massacre|pg||
nt|po-s: one down would beat this result though|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|jcmax: There is really no chance here. As soon as s gets in with the @SA he can cash 3@D tricks and then the defenders still have another trick to come|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|h5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pc|h8|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|jcmax: There are some potential squezze chances here. But unfortunately for dclarer he has to make a discard now at a point that is most unconvenient|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club 10 exit fatal|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|babydolldk: Ja lille og hj til D og sp til d og hj E...|pg||

nt|jcmax: The hands have not been wildly distributional this set so far|pg||

pc|d5|pc|h8|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcmax: NS are apparently playing Puppet Stayman over 2NT. The response of 3@D would have shown at least 1 4cd major, hence the 3NT bid|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|c8|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jcmax: Might any NS pairs get to 6@D?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jcmax: Strong club pairs might get there, if they treat the N hand as a positive over a 1@C opening|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|flash: again, our scores are not official; the official version are entered table-side using Bridgemates|pg||
nt|jcmax: xx in @D opposite a void! can they work that out?|pg||
nt|dburn:  not a bad slam here either|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|flash: (and today's Daily Bulletin bemoaned the number of corrections to those which had to be made)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jcmax: The opponents' bidding may be helpful in that respect|pg||
mb|4C|nt|dburn:  sure - West has  a very good hand now|pg||
mb|4D|mb|5C|nt|jcmax: If E gets some kind of @C support from partner he may very well just bid the slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzje: next rd we will have the Bessis vs Brogeland  &   Malinowski|pg||
nt|jcmax: There is a minor technical point in the play here|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcmax: After drawing trumps declarer will make sure he eliminates the red suits before playing a 1S up|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|cT|nt|jcmax: that way he doesn't risk to losing @S aJ doubleton offside|pg||
