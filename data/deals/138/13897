nt|buffytvs: sos how do we feel about rebidding 1NT with a singleton in partner's suit?|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|c3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||
nt|sharkey: the alternative is to open 1@D and then bid 2@C|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this is a hand pattern where my partner and I used to open 1@H -- bascially the only time you could open 1@H with 4, but it made a lot of auctions easier|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1 NT is OK, when partner has passes allready - he has no 6-card @S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  passed|pg||
nt|sharkey: perhaps one argument for rebidding 1 NT is that pd can bid 2@H with 5-4 in M; if opening 1@D the @H suit may vanish totally|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Exactly|pg||
nt|sharkey: some may rebid 2@S with a 5 suiter too Hans|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - 5 card suit|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- I would|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d8|pc|s4|pc|c9|pg||

mb|1H|nt|sybarra: I think e/w will try 4 @S here at the end of the day |pg||
nt|jaapfr: still   Studentenes sounds very female to me but do not master Norwegian|pg||
nt|andyv:  S took a far more aggressive stance on board 1 and found the excellent save of 5@d for 9 imp gain|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: On Board 1 Studentenes have picked up 11 IMPs - not 10.  6@S at this table was off 2.  This will be corrected|pg||
nt|rodal f: By his 9HP Forfot ain't fare away for a normalopening.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: Shud be some action here?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sharkey: 3@C some kind of mixed raise?|pg||

nt|rodal f: But a interestin @C contract EW.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  W not elated with the dbl|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The defence to the Multi Two Diamonds is fundamentally different from the defence to a weak two for a number of reasons: |pg||
nt|andyv:  2N leb?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then can raise to 2S in two different ways, distinguishing pure obstruction from some genuine values|pg||
mb|3S|nt|h_karluk: The direct defender always gets two opportunities to bid. |pg||

nt|h_karluk: The 4th seat defender usually gets two opportunities to bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Our excellent operator, Torstein Hesseberg, informs me the club is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year - also followed by a big tournement this fall|pg||

nt|andyv:  looking for 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: 2 nt 3 cl 3h should be alerted|pg||
nt|h_karluk: So does that make defending against the multi 2? easier or more difficult than against a weak two? In my opinion there's no problem  as long as you are sensible about it. ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Basically, assume that the 2D opener has a weak 2H/S hand. |pg||
nt|andyv:  ty|pg||

nt|vugraphzkn: :-)|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would expect most to double.  Meanwhile, this seems somewhat meek.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: There are numerous variations of the multi 2D, so let's assume a fairly basic one (weak major; strong minor or strong balanced). The suggested defence does not really change if ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there are other possibilities such as 4441 distributions  assume a weak opener. |pg||
nt|andyv:  like all systems...after a while a decent defense or multiple defenses are found and then we wait for the newest development.|pg||
