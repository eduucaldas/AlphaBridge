mb|p|mb|p|nt|po-s: Poland,Norway,England...he represented England last year but not this one as he has a new partner|pg||
nt|jcmax: Might E have doubled for a @D lead here?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|flash: the bloodthirsty among the specs want an X from East to get a @D lead|pg||
nt|chorush: he might have and it would have been successful, it appears|pg||
nt|flash: looks good from here - as long as partner has one to lead??|pg||
nt|flash: welcome to Ira Chorush|pg||
nt|jcmax: If declarer starts playing on @S, the defence still has time to switch to a @D|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jcmax: But if he starts with @C Easts entry will be gone by the time the @Ds are good|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|chorush: However, on occasion North has West's spade ace and then you canbe looking at a number like 1400|pg||
nt|po-s: he needs a club or two so must play them now|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|po-s: ver very hard for West to hop up with spade ace to play a diamond|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|jcmax: At the other table S downgraded his poor 11-count and responded 1NT, so the partnership didn't get to game|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|flash: this is IMPs, compared against the entire field; max gain/loss on a board capped at 17 IMPs x 22 comparisons|pg||
nt|jcmax: for my money E should double 3NT for the @D lead. N very likely has a weak NT, so NS's hcp are limited. If N has 18/19 balanced c'est la vie....|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|flash: it is quite rare for a French player to raise to 2M with only 3-card support|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|flash: some consider it unpatriotic to commit a 3-card raise!!|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|nt|flash: 2@D forcing check-back (forcing to game)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|r|mb|p|nt|flash: XX to show the Ace|pg||
nt|chorush: 6NT from North is the best contract but can't be reached after 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes Jim, we discussed this before. :) rebidding 1NT on this hand type is as French as the bouillabaise :)|pg||
nt|flash: a rather imaginative X by Brogeland|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|po-s: stopping partner from leading away from any minor honour|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: Now the fortunate heart distribution may come into play on a club lead|pg||
nt|jcmax: 6NT from the S side is in danger on a @C lead|pg||
nt|flash: 14 tricks on the favorable @H position|pg||
nt|jcmax: Declarer will have to gues the @H layout|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chorush: when delarer leads a heart to the Q Malinowski will drop the 9 or 10|pg||
nt|jcmax: When declarer plays a @H to the !Q E should play the 9 or 10 to make declarer guess|pg||
nt|po-s: strange choice - he might have dia loser which might be thrown away on a third spade|pg||
nt|flash: the specs are abuzz with the obligatory falsecard we'll see in the @H suit|pg||
nt|jcmax: On a @S lead it is a different story. Now declarer will cash the @Ha to guard against singleton K|pg||
nt|flash: if they're good enough to bid, they're good enough to lead??|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|flash: the Daily Bulletin will have to find its story on this hand at another table...|pg||

nt|flash: we'll encourage the advancing players to read up on the subject of Obligatory Falsecards|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|flash: and to consider/learn the percentage implications from declarer's viewpoint|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|jcmax: I seem to recall Mike Lawrence has written a nice book on falsecards|pg||

mc|11|nt|chorush: Malinowski was hoping for AJ10x spades from his partner|pg||
nt|flash: we only get a minimal fee from Mike for the referral...|pg||
