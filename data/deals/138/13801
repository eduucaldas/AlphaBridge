mb|1D|mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: results are only posted after the 27 board session|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Hello from the Cavendish Round 3 27 boards today|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjf: DeKnijff and Wrang are the current leaders|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: each board is IMP'd against the other 22 tables --  max = 17 imps * 22|pg||
nt|po-s: with a club back this might be diddicult|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS had a good showing in one of the Reno National Pair events, but it is relatively new partnership|pg||
nt|po-s: difficult|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: L'Ecuyer has his cards on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: it will be a bit of thinking on his part -- a very thoughtful player|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems only other option for L'Ecuyer is to play Krekorian for the short @D|pg||
nt|po-s: it would take time from thefastest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: L'Ecuyer can't be slower ... i mean more deliberate ... than Krekorian|pg||
nt|po-s: someone with a singleon diamond wouldn´t put his cards on the table|pg||

pc|dK|nt|po-s: I think North will find the club switch - yes|pg||

nt|ahollan1: oops -- i think DeKnijff needed to play another @S first|pg||
nt|po-s: how would that help?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought only chance was if he could knock out @SA before 2nd round of @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: didn't see any way to make without that -- but don't quote me|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|po-s: it won´t help as long as they keep the spade ace and then hit the club with a trump left|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjf: DeKnijff is looking at the last board double checking himself|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|ahollan1: you can spy on all vugraph tables simultaneously using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   [one window per room]|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3rd seat 1N=17+ - 20   that implies this 1N rebid VERY wide range|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: one other possibility from looking at their CC is that 1N was a transfer to @C|pg||
pc|s4|nt|dburn:  I believe that is what they play - 1@d opened only with unbalanced hands|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course  ---  1@D=5+@D or 4@D(441)    thanks David|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: never underlead aces    except trick 1 AND 2 :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|dburn:  seems to be working so far|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: when is it ever right to duck the @C10?|pg||
nt|dburn:  but South unlikely to try it at trick three also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: missing 100 honors |pg||
nt|dburn:  well, it is right if South has the singelton ace|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|dburn:  but perhaps that is not the most probable layout|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|c7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose @C10 from QJ10    duck to singleton Ace for 2 trump losers and if 22 - always 2 losers|pg||

nt|vugraphzjf: DeKnijff looks at the board again of L'Ecuyer and says "Well Done"|pg||

nt|vugraphzjf: Good Luck by Wrang|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wrang passed hand, and they often open with 10 HCP  -- defending look best to me - even at this vul|pg||

nt|ahollan1: warning to specs -- after EVERY set of 3 boards, the rooms are closed -- don't panic, just wait for new tables to open|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
mc|10|nt|vugraphzjf: closing and will be back in a few minutes|pg||
