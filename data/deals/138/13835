mb|4S|an|dont dbl this guy|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 6-4 = bid more, suitable vulnerability too|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: i thought our NS was still ahead of their NS|pg||
nt|petergill: sorry, we have the leaders (NS) here, my mistake|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: useless hand partner   oh, i mean thank you|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is not our first 8 card suit of the day|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and yesterday there were 2 9-baggers|pg||

nt|petergill: West wiiely stayed out of the auction. A light 3NT overcall by West might go down 1700 or 2000, though East might run to 4@C. |pg||

nt|ritong: especially facing a passed hand|pg||
mc|10|nt|vugraphzjf: T Bessis says well played!|pg||
nt|ritong: "light overcall" was the understatement of the week:-)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i wonder why 4@S alerted -- maybe Wrang allowed to bid with quick tricks?|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
mb|1S|an|alerted|nt|ahollan1: and 1 round force|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: alerted by our operator to allow the comment "don't double this guy"|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 1@S art game force relay -- if they're playing their normal card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know the response to the relay :(|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|3D|nt|petergill: These slams on a finesse can have a dramatic effect on the outcome of IMP-scored events like this one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since @CK is onside, they probably won't bid slam|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4D|nt|petergill: Perhaps the interfernce has stopped the artificial relay auction?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: i think it has|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when slam is bid, @CK offside   it's part of The Great Shuffler's bag of tricks|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: DBL takes up no space -- doubt relays off    but 3@D ....|pg||
nt|petergill: !F @C10 was not there, the slam would be very poor. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: M bessis asking questions|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ask/answer louder please|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: wrang tells me he showed Cs and S  and prob short @d|pg||
nt|petergill: Anyone who bids slam gets a lucky bonus of perhaps 22 (tables) X 13 (imps) = up to 286 imps. |pg||

nt|vugraphzjf: thanks al|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|petergill: and the format is such that pairs who are struggling might punt a slam like that one, to try to catch up|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 more boards to play to finish out the day, then final 27 boards tomorrow morning 10:30 Las Vegas|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: one more round but Debbie Hyatt will do the operating as I own one of the pairs|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: significant session prizes always keep pairs interested even when not in hunt for overall|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|petergill: Thanks Barry, great job - and Barry, did you hear that the Aussie youngsters you visited in Australia in February won our Autumn National Open Teams a week ago?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: I watched the match|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: BBO makes it a small world|pg||

nt|petergill: 4-0 trump break but no problems for declarer|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d7|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if 3@S "mixed" [probably] or preempt --- either way, de Knijff was bidding 4@S|pg||
nt|petergill: With trump Axxx any expert defender almost always ducks the first two trumps, almost on autopilot to do so|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Declarer has to worry about 4-2 @hs and an over ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: we know there is no problem but he doesnt|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c3|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|petergill: ditto a defender with trump Kxxx or trump AKxx or trumps AQxx, in the latter two case ducking the first trump smoothly is usually best|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: if he ruffs the first @h with the 10 then the defense crosses for another over ruff with the 4th @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: needs to cut communications I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D3 at trick 1 probably means @D5-3  East won't be 0=4-5=4 [DBL] so actual shape most liekly|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: but then might get tapped out|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|petergill: Declarer did not waste @S!0 unnecessarily on early round of spades as less carefuler players sometimes do|pg||
mc|10|nt|vugraphzjf: closing |pg||
