mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|jcmax: another top encounter here. The americans were 4th and the French 8th after session 2|pg||
nt|flash: some players/pairs have demoted the minor suits so much, they'd respond 1@S with the North hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: QUEDA 1 MATCH?|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: SRRY|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|flash: but this so distorts the suit lengths, that partner will have trouble working out what's going on (even if you can still generate a reasonable auction)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: 2@H is the default rebid after a 2/1; some might have tried 2NT (also not promising extras)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jcmax: The auction convinced W to lead a @D. It did indeed sound like the opps wouldn't have much of a @D-stopper|pg||
nt|flash: declarer can take a lot of tricks by taking a lot of finesses|pg||
nt|jcmax: Many pairs would bid to 3NT much quicker|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|jcmax: But their opponent wouldn't lead the doubleton @DQ :)|pg||

mb|1C|nt|flash: i've been told the male version of Norwegian Std uses a liberal 14+ - 17 as the range   :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jcmax: you haven't seen the females yet!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: but H&H are usually relatively solid citizens|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: W has another difficult opening leaad problem|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|flash: as is usual in this form of scoring, even hands which seem destined to be flat will have a few extreme results|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|jcmax: He likely reasons, if partner has a long suit it can almost only be @D. If it was 1S he would have bid over 1@H|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|jcmax: There is no point in leading his own long suit, because that is the suit bid by dummy.|pg||

mb|2H|nt|jcmax: So, let's say the auction went 1@D - p- 1N- p- p 2@D. would that be natural or a weak t/o for the majors?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|flash: Casen considering bidding more?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|flash: an expensive intervention|pg||
nt|jcmax: It seems declarer has to lose at leas 4 top tricks in the black, a ruff and still a trump|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|h4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|d3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|jcmax: Probably he ahs to lose 31S tricks tough, because he will be stuck in his hand on best defense|pg||
nt|jcmax: that woul require S to shift to a @H now|pg||
nt|flash: or cash a @S honor to see what partner has to say|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|flash: and, when partner discourages (shows 3), find the @H shift|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|jcmax: a low 1S might work, but declaer may work it out after already having seen 9 hcp in N's hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcmax: Nicely done by casen!|pg||
