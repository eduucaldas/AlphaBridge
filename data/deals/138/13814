mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|kareno: I'm being asked if there are running scores.  |pg||
nt|kareno: The talent to know when to double :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|flash: so 1@D is nebulous|pg||
nt|jcmax: I am informed by a very knowledgabel kib that W couldn't rebid 21C, because that would have shown 3@S|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like they will reach a straightforward 3nt.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|kareno: Curious requirement but it is, after all, their system |pg||

nt|flash: for security reasons, scores/standings aren't posted until the end of each session|pg||
nt|flash: 5 sessions of 9 3-board rounds; each pair will play every other pair|pg||
nt|chorush: Now his attention switches to overticks but there is no way to ensure not having a possibility to go set that I can see|pg||
nt|jcmax: There isn't really much to the deal at this table. At the other table, though, proceedings have been more exciting with S doubling the final 3N contract when N overcalled 1@S|pg||
nt|flash: scoring is IMPs across the field; max gain/loss on a board capped at 17 IMPs x 22 comparisons|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|jcmax: Declarer can take 3@H, 1@D, 1@C and 2@S tricks if he finesses in @S|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcmax: And there is no way the defense can get 7 tricks first|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|pc|d7|pg||
nt|flash: unless West took his Ace then   :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: Helness and Elinescu have been laughing and joking a lot|pg||
nt|kareno: Or two clubs and one spade if south attacks clubs now.|pg||
nt|flash: @H9, @C honor or a small @C??|pg||
nt|jcmax: Several kis suggest small @C now. But please notice N played the @D 8!!!!|pg||
nt|flash: small @C seems to offer most chances for the defense??|pg||
nt|jcmax: He wouldn't do that if he had anything in @C|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|nt|jcmax: N's 2nd @D clearly should be suit preference aiding partner in finding the right defense|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kareno: That diamond 8 is suit preference for the higher suit, hearts, (for the specs)|pg||

mb|p|nt|chorush: looks like they will get to 4H and Wladow may get to show his doubling talent|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: the duplication in @Ss and the splits of the rounded suits leads to...|pg||
nt|jcmax: great prediction ira :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Here's one of those doubles that Sabine was talking about :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
