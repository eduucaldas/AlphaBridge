mb|d|mb|2C|nt|lc: Important now to know your runout methods.|pg||
nt|lc: Surely, L-W do.|pg||
nt|flash: welcome to Walter Johnson, our resident expert on RM Precision|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: 2@C not alerted?   |pg||
nt|lc: I'd think it might be @C and another.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzje: yes alertted|pg||
nt|jcmax: Most likely s could have shown a 2-suited run-out, but preferred to rely on his 5-card suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: trying to read what the paper says|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: i think clubs + a higher suit|pg||
nt|flash: 1@D nebulous|pg||
nt|lc: Even if it showed @C and another suit, Levin must have feared the other was @S, so he passed.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|lc: Levin was willing to try 2@C undoubled -- and then take a chance that the other suit wasn't @S if he got doubled in 2@C.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|lc: Of course, from our catbird seats, we see that @H was the place to be N-S.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|bigtrain: hi larry, jim|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d4|nt|flash: but @S partial likely to be on for E-W, so -100 reasonable for N-S??|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c6|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|lc: Shouldn't be too bad, no.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lc: I wonder about the E-W agreements (probably not discussed) as to wheter after East doubles 1NT, if the partnership is allowed to allow E-W to play in 2@C undoubled.|pg||
nt|lc: Is that one in the MEcwell playbook, Walter?|pg||
nt|jcmax: And also what a double of 2@C would have been. Italian style would be t/o, but not everyone plays that way|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i don't think it's forcing after NT overcalls|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they are pretty aggressive Xing...  so opener's pass isn't forcing|pg||
nt|flash: 700 cross-IMP margin between 3rd and 4th, starting the session; if someone's piling up a monster, they could well emerge from the pack|pg||
nt|jcmax: But if you play that way you are pretty safe passing 21C with the E hand, because W won't be short in @C|pg||
nt|jcmax: The opponents can fool you of course by psyching :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lc: It can't possibly be Meck's turn to play.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|cK|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|flash: back to down 1?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|lc: When things aren't going well, this is one of the few times Meckstroth can get a little frustrated/testy with his partner for taking too long.|pg||
nt|flash: now making???|pg||
mc|8|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|lc: Nat|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: wow - we have a verified report from tableside that the cow which flew by was white with black spots...|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 2@C = 6+@C 10-15, any distribution with primary clubs|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lc: Likely to reach 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: HH at the other table scored 100 as EW. How does that result compare to LW's result here?|pg||
nt|flash: based on what we saw, lose 5|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lc: So, declarer will work on @C, but the defense has ample opportunity to set up the setting tricks, it seems.|pg||
nt|flash: but this table likely to be the outlier on the board|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|lc: (I have to get those "appears" and "seems" in to cover myself.) :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: A very awkward hand in 3NT. Declarer doesn't really have a suit he can play on|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|lc: But, you'd think unless he is being tricky, he will work on @C.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|flash: hedging bets as commentator usually (:)) a good idea, Larry|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|jcmax: No doubt declarer is planning to run the @CQ. On this particularer layou N has no problem covering. But let's say he had only Kxx, would he find the cover?|pg||
nt|lc: Not easy|pg||
nt|lc: That's why Meck blocked the @S to start @C from dummy.|pg||
nt|flash: we've already seen an instance where not playing the @CK in defense proved costly??|pg||
nt|flash: @D to keep the defense alive; low @D to keep down 2 in the picture??|pg||
nt|lc: From Weinstein's point of view, if dec has @DQ, it's not likely to hurt to shift to @D -- and if partner has it -- he must shift.  So, at the risk of being double-dummy again, I'm ...|pg||
nt|lc: betting on him.|pg||
nt|lc: I bet on Grue on 15 and was wrong.  It's so easy when we see all the cards.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lc: Can't always be wrong.|pg||
nt|jcmax: You were right this time, larry! :)|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|s4|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|d2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lc: In my estimation, Steve Weinstein is one of those players that sneaks by under the radar -- not a household name like Hamman, Meckstroth, etc. -- but surely one of the very very ...|pg||
nt|lc: best players.|pg||
mc|7|nt|lc: Just ask the other top players -- they know.|pg||

qx|o18|st||md|4S9H96DAK9854CAT93,SAT43HAQ853DQ3CQ6,SKJ6HK4DT762CJ754,SQ8752HJT72DJCK82|sv|n|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|1N|nt|lc: Assumin X = 4@S, North's only choice was 1NT or to raise @D.|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|lc: Some sort of 3-level @H raise by East would have made matters tougher for South.|pg||
nt|flash: 2@D a constructive @H raise?|pg||
mb|d|nt|flash: (leaving a direct 2@H as weaker)|pg||
nt|lc: I like jump-cue = mixed raise (so 3@D = 4 trumps and about 7-9).|pg||
nt|jcmax: It has become increasingly popular to play a 1@S bid by N in this situation as denying 4+@S and no other good bid. That also might be an option if in the arsenal|pg||
nt|lc: So, either 3@H or 3@D by East -- but take up the space with 9 trumps.   Surprise, Surprise that I would advocate that.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meckwell usually play jump to 1-under is the mixed raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|lc: Okay -- I know people will be disappointed if I don't point out that N-S have 10@D, E-W 9@H, etc...|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|lc: I'm always accused of "adjusting" to make trumps = tricks, anyway -- but here I maybe don't have to.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Anyway, East let South off very easy here -- he got to do it all.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lc: So he'll make 130 -- whereas E-W can make 140.  Nice round for N-S.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcmax: That means the "par" result on this board would be 4@H doubled down 1|pg||
nt|jcmax: Par result means everyone does their best looking at all 4 hands.|pg||
nt|lc: Even the commentators dont' seem able to do that.|pg||
nt|lc: But, have pity us, please.|pg||
nt|lc: This is an underpaid, underappreciated, overcriticized job.|pg||
