nt|petergill: 10-30 Las Vegas is 3-30am here in Sydney, alas|pg||

mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|petergill: Does anyone remember the days when people used not to open 1NT with no stoppers in two suits? Yes, that was long ago. Most of you would not have been playing bridge in those days. ...|pg||
nt|petergill: My, how the game has improved. |pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: Surprised Casen Q bid with 1 point in his partner's suit|pg||

nt|petergill: 4@C cue bid shows slam interest, 4@S denies 1st or 2nd round control in @Hs|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with all red cards -- i wonder if Drew considered 3N -- but AK A ...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petergill: Perhaps the cue is compulsory in their methods?|pg||

mb|p|nt|poohbear: i keep looking for the redeal button but i am not operating :)|pg||
nt|petergill: I like Barry's approach|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C? Or ?? Too strong to preempt?|pg||
mb|1C|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|petergill: 2@C Michaels|pg||
mb|3C|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|petergill: I thought West would settle for 4@S, once partner could merely bid 2@S not 3@S|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@H a mild forward move, as West could be much stronger on this auction|pg||

nt|ahollan1: this is it for tonite -- good thing too, i'm exhausted|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Last board of today I would like to thank BBO and World Bridge Productions for allowing us to bring this event to all of the bridge players through out the world. starts tomorrow ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: at 10:30 PDT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room just posted session scores through round 8 -- maybe Debbie will list here too|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: didn't we start this session with a 4@H opener?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: get some one to send it to me and I will be happy too|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Thanks to the operators Barry Goren, David Stern, Catalina Robles and perhaps one other person whose name I should remember|pg||
nt|petergill: Debbie Hyatt, sorry|pg||
nt|poohbear: Debbie Hyatt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bart Bramley also rebid 3@S on  25 -- but Demirev bid 4@D instead of 4@C|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: i suspect 4@D was conventionally shortness|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petergill: Normal is to play small from dummy, hoping to draw the king at Trick 1. |pg||
pc|sA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|petergill: East has to decide if partner has a singleton or has 3 spades. |pg||
nt|petergill: @SA is less revealing to declarer than @SK would have been. |pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: that was BOLS tip long ago from Billy Eisenberg -- Play Low From Dummy  [at trick 1]|pg||
nt|petergill: Win @DA and switch to your trump = normal here|pg||
nt|petergill: Not that it does much good on this layout|pg||

nt|ahollan1: what is inference from no @H return?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Wrang is  a very thoughtful player of his cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: 1st for this session i s Garner Zia|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: marter woolsey|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@SX might have escaped for 300 (even 100 maybe??), as declarer can just about play double dummy in 4@SX, so Martin de Knijff's decision to bid 5@H looks like to turned out well.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: this is after 8 rounds|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Lair Lord|pg||

mc|12|nt|vugraphzjf: it looks the the leader is Helness and Helgemo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh - he dropped the @HK!|pg||
nt|petergill: Martel - Woolsey were 19th, so they will move into the top ten, probably the top five. |pg||
nt|petergill: Scores after 3 sessions at http://cavendishinvitational.com/2010/PAIRS5O.htm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: none of the other leaders mentioned, so question is relative session scores for deKnijff-Wrang and Helgemo-Helness|pg||
