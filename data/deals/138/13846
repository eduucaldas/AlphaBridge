nt|ahollan1: i think Vic Mitchell once asked -- what would be toughest game for you -- answer 3 more Vic Mitchell's|pg||
mb|2C|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Maybe on the same day even|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: [yes, it could have been one of the other stars from that era]|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|henryb:  Crawford, and he said it would be too tough|pg||
pc|c9|pg||

mc|11|nt|po-s: better take your tricks and hope partner has another two...|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|d!|nt|vugraphzjf: 3 card support|pg||
nt|Walddk2: double = 3-card support|pg||
mb|r|nt|henryb:  XX = good hand and support probably|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzjf: lots of groups of 3 fingers being held up around the table|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: That's how Norwegians and Swedes communicate|pg||
nt|barnets: declarer would be forced to make 3N as east here on a spade lead|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|po-s: yes as long as there is more than one|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|nt|po-s: 3NT seems ok|pg||
nt|barnets: to beat5@C north must win the @CA |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Helness 1@D=4+   their opening bids are very natural  even 1@C=4+ unless 4333|pg||
nt|barnets: or he will be endplayed later|pg||
nt|barnets: in hearts|pg||
nt|po-s: doesn´t matter Barnet|pg||
nt|barnets: after eliminating the side suits|pg||
nt|po-s: heart to jack after elimination is good enough|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|s3|pg||

nt|barnets: yes that works|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Tor shakes his head|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: when he sees the Q|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not 100% because Helness might hold @HH9x|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|barnets: south might have Q98 also|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hardly|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: :)  Q97|pg||

nt|jbgood: well - you are right PO|pg||
nt|barnets: If south had the @H8 north had to win the @CA immediately|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Barnet really wants South to hold dummy's @H8 :)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=4+, but usually 5+|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: sorry i had the wrong hand dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Always 5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: They play 5443|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: and clubs only 3 with exactly 4333|pg||
nt|po-s: good lead|pg||

nt|ahollan1: for specs  5443 lists minimum cards for opening  1@S/@H/@D/@C|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|hT|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|jbgood: so a di ruff rather than a heart ruff to take it 2 down|pg||
mc|8|nt|Walddk2: Back to the 5@C before. I don't understand Andersson's line when he advanced @H10. Helgemo must surely have a heart honour. How else did he have an invite?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: closing and reopening for the next round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver only on trick 4, but Levin DID fly @CA|pg||
nt|barnets: actually east was the dummy in 5@C so from norths oint of view south could have held the @H8|pg||
nt|barnets: and flying 1CA could have ensured the defeat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Brink made it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver made 5@C |pg||
nt|ahollan1: they played 5@C from East|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: okay am going to close the  table the next match will be Helness and Helgemo  vs the other Swede's Fallenius and Fredin|pg||
nt|barnets: thats because west held the @H8 as po explained|pg||
nt|barnets: and was endplayed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, and he played a heart to the jack in the endgame, thgen guessed on the way back|pg||
