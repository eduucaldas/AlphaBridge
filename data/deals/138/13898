mb|4D|mb|p|nt|flash: re-xfer?|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure this one has been discussed extensively|pg||
nt|ludewig: gibes a choice between Majors 6 Hearts and 3 Spades|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: probably designed to offer partner a choice among seven-card fits, but passing 3NT was also an option|pg||

nt|capercliff: not this time tho Jim|pg||
nt|ampelman: DF said there was a way but I didn't see it either|pg||

nt|capercliff: E did X2@d as well|pg||

nt|dburn: might have gone anti-percentage in trumps to create a swing, but game wasn't bound to be bid at the other table, so you might have a swing just by reaching it|pg||
