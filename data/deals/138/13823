mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: welcome to George Mittelman|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|mittmouse: hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: can South do more, vulnerable??|pg||
nt|flash: not without risk...|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|s8|pg||
nt|flash: the trump split seems to leave declarer a trick short?|pg||
nt|mittmouse: he certainly thought about it|pg||
nt|mittmouse: ah youth|pg||
nt|flash: :)   last time i referred to a pair as youngsters, i was told they were already considered ancient|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||
nt|flash: the N-S pair have been part of Team Orange, the Dutch National Team, for several years now|pg||
nt|flash: from what we've seen of the pairs during the recent 'friendlies' against other national teams, we'd expect them to be among the 3 pairs named to play in this year's European ...|pg||
nt|flash: Championships|pg||
nt|mittmouse: it n had dbled 2h is that penalty or responsive|pg||
nt|flash: i'm told the selection has been announced and they are, indeed, going to play in Ostend|pg||
nt|flash: seems likely to be penalties, George, even though some play all Xs below 2NT are t/o??|pg||

nt|flash: Helgemo avoids the @C finesse, which might have led to problems|pg||
nt|flash: and now a @C through will settle the issue|pg||
nt|flash: i suppose North might hold Q5 of @Hs, and need a @S through for a promotion|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|flash: and South arrives at the correct answer (on this layout??)|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C!|an|6!hs  or any 15-17|mb|p|nt|mittmouse: just shows what an uncanny helgemo has for the game in not taking club finesse|pg||
nt|flash: the N-S pair frequently display an allergy to the green card|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: and they have a system tool which allows them to stay low|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|flash: no plus available for N-S on this one??   |pg||
nt|flash: we can see the favorable @C position for the defense, but a low @C here (and the play of the Ten from East) seems most unlikely|pg||
nt|flash: Ace and a @D as the least of evils?|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: helgemo asking south,|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: screen down|pg||
nt|flash: just to make sure we get a play quickly:  1) De Knijff - Wrang;  2) H&H;  3)  Levin-Weinstein;  4) Peikarek-Smirnov;  5) Bessis-Bessis;  6)  L'Ecuyer-Krekorian|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i think he will make it then it seems like only a low club assures success|pg||
