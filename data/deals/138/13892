nt|sharkey: just been informed the cc are also at www.nmlag.com|pg||
nt|rodal f: At N Petter Haram wich have several final at the Norwegian pair final. His normal mate useto be Tommy Skodje.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Great, so we can either play bridge or 52 pick-up.  OK -- bridge it is.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Lars Arthur Johansen|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1N|mb|d|nt|andyv:  4@s looks reasonable|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S to start with which can be -1|pg||
nt|andyv:  faster than I could type it:)|pg||
nt|larsarthur: hi|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcwla: Hi Roland, Hi Lars|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi Jordan|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sharkey: Both pairs play natutral systems; EW use transfers after 1@C opening|pg||
nt|jcwla: I am guessing we are off one space.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  depends on lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but very unlikely -1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @C lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  won't happen|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe A of @d|pg||
mb|5D|nt|rodal f: Belive the @C lead will come.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Skjetne did not support pd - perhaps concerned that any bidding may help opps|pg||
nt|andyv:  but to win post mortems, have to lead partner's suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Nope.|pg||

pc|hA|nt|sharkey: well - 5@S doesn't make either so Grand have to hope OR at least try for slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning Carl and Frank|pg||

nt|jaapfr: are EW female students:)?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Also part of the explanation why when it's not clear who owns the hand or who can make what, the 5 level belongs to the opponents.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|2S|nt|sharkey: off 1 or 2?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Or a auto stop at 2@H?|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h should make |pg||
mb|3C|nt|sharkey: A rarity - a weak 2@D opener|pg||
nt|sharkey: the previous board was down 2 - not 1 - will be corrected|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to find A@c and Q@c lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: good vuln save|pg||
nt|andyv:  down at least 500|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: This contract is playable by a dobble hook in @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: looks reasonable - unless the 4-1 @H break becomes a problem|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here is a good example of a hand that natural bidders should open 1@D.|pg||
nt|larsarthur: south is not sure about @dfit|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Marshall Lewis|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hi all :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Must be prepared for all continuations -- here, 1@D and then 3@C and you feel much better than this.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  now it's serious:)|pg||
nt|larsarthur: lowest 4-card is std in Norway|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Marshalll.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|sharkey: A @D lead appears to be best for defence|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S had only 4 losers imo|pg||
nt|jcwla: Interesting to know but that doesn't begin and end the conversation for me in terms of how best to describe this hand.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are arguments on both sides, but you aren;lt getting full value for money out of sputnik if you follow the same sequence with this S hand and also on   xx  AKx   xx  Axxxxx|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  on @s lead, can N still hold it down to only 4 losers?|pg||
nt|andyv:  without dbl dummying the @c suit?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rodal f: If any want to look at the pairs systemcards u find them here: http://www.nmlag.com/Systemkort til the turney is fin|pg||
nt|jcwla: When the clubs are significantly stronger or you will be able to handle all continuations, I have no problem with 1@C.  Here, a rebid problem such as this was reasonably likely.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you ask then too much|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in other words, i think the disadvantages of 1C outweight the advantages|pg||

pc|s2|nt|sharkey: W wud be better off returning @DQ and E had to duck.  Think that would have ensured 1 down on overruff|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rodal f: The web page for the turney (incuded the winners from yesterdays turney) Engebretsen and Skov (Superbaby). http://www.nmlag.com/|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|sharkey: Not many use weak 2@D opener - I believe it sometimes is very effective|pg||

nt|andyv:  true|pg||
nt|andyv:  vs. 550:)|pg||
