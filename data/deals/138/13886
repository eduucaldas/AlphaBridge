mb|1H!|an|!s|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: 1@H = spades|pg||
mb|2S!|an|2!s|nt|stoffers: 2@s is 13-14 and 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: optimist bidding by S in CR|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|stoffers: 4@h would be a splinter now, but is it worth it? You need the perfect hand|pg||
nt|pelu: some would support pd with 3@h in East|pg||
nt|stoffers: and as Bob says (hamman):  if you're looking for the perfect hand just forget it, i dont have it :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think the 4@H splinter is a slight overbid when you lack controls in two other suits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: quacks are not that useful for high suit contracts|pg||
nt|stoffers: simonsen with nothing wasted might take s shot at slam with AK@s and A@d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: quacks = queen/jack|pg||
nt|stoffers: we use quacks in notrump roland, not in suits:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Exactly my point|pg||
nt|pelu: if 3@c is forcing then I would bid that|pg||
nt|stoffers: its a short suit invitation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: queens and jacks are good for notrump, not for suits|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: then 3@h!!!!!!!!!|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@h as a short suit invitation - if pd bid 3@s thne 4@s from me would be slam invit with short suit|pg||
