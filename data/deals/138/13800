mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: welcome to Sabine Auken!!|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|jcmax: hi all|pg||
pc|d6|nt|flash: N-S probably play a variation of French Std:  5-card majors; 15-17 NT; quite similar to SAYC|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|pg||
nt|poohbear: A tad conservative on Passell's part. Casen is a solid citizen when it comes to preempts|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|poohbear: game might not make though|pg||
nt|flash: E-W not a regular partnership - undoubtedly some flavor of 2/1 for them|pg||
nt|flash: welcome to Barry Goren - on site and taking a break from operator duties|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|jcmax: HI Barry!|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|jcmax: The only one with a "real" opening bid is N. let's see whether he will come to it|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: Casen-Passell in 4th after 2 sessions; Bessis et Bessis in 9th|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: so director came to tell the bessis that they will play next round again on vugraph and casen said "what, why, only the good looking guys stay?" and director said "is for some ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: reason"|pg||
mb|1N|nt|flash: :)   thnx, Catalina|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gunther da: hello everybody|pg||
nt|jcmax: Even if S had bid 2@S now, W might very well have competed to 3@C|pg||
mb|p|pc|dT|nt|jcmax: It is always a veryinteresting discussion whether E's sequence shows 5@H+4@C or 4@H+5@C or either one|pg||
nt|jcmax: hello|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: some spanish talking here in the table :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: I always assume it's 4-5 since my partner expects me to have 3 @hs when I pass his response|pg||
nt|poohbear: no reson to bid @cs then|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think that after W passes 1H, this ought to show long clubs, otherwise E could compete with 2H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry barry:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: Casen asking Thomas about leads|pg||
nt|poohbear: If declarer " knew " trumps were 2-2 this would be a draw trumps hand|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, that is a very important point. so, maybe we can all stop discussing it now and just make a note of it and let partner know :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: problem is that he needs to ruff 2@h in dummy most likely|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||

nt|poohbear: easy|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|jcmax: But not necessarily. for one he may be able to set up the @D-suit and also something good could happen in the @H-suit|pg||

nt|jcmax: some might open a strong NT with this.....|pg||
nt|jcmax: in 3rd seat :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: is the threat level orange?|pg||
nt|jcmax: It's just a fun thing to do. Especially with a new partner. :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: I am curious to see if Casen acts over a 2@s opener|pg||
nt|flash: since we've picked up quite a crowd as the round has progressed,  www.cavendishinviational.com|pg||
mb|2S|nt|flash: again for security reasons, results are not posted until the end of each session|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|flash: my fingers seem to be fighting back:    www.cavendishinvitational.com|pg||
nt|jcmax: W seems to have a nice passed hand t/o dbl now|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: Next rd we are going to have Bompis &  Quantin  vs the Bessis|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: At a different vulnerability Casen would surely have considered a pass|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|jcmax: N does best not to play the A here, but declarer can always get 1@S, 4@H, 2@D and 2@C tricks for his contract|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d6|pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|poohbear: Should play a @d now I would think|pg||
nt|poohbear: dbl hook|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think he is wondering about the @d pitch|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|flash: since no late @H re-entry to dummy, Ace and a @D on a @C return??|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcmax: So now if S continues @S and N ducks, declarer has a guess|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|flash: no longer an issue|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c7|pc|h5|pc|c5|pg||
nt|jcmax: He may well cash the @DA to see if the Q drops and if it doesn't finess in @C|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|flash: other 4?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|flash: other black 4?   guess not|pg||
mc|8|nt|jcmax: It seems declarer was playing for @S to be 5-4|pg||
nt|flash: big swing to Bessis et Bessis|pg||
nt|flash: again, both tables will shut down briefly between rounds|pg||
nt|jcmax: in which case N could only have cashed 3 tricks and would have had to lead a @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: will be back soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: closing table|pg||
