nt|rnmalik: cards are favourably placed and we can see it. |pg||
nt|jcwla: Good idea to lead bid majors on the go against NT when the other partner has not shown any support for them; but not, as here, when N should have at least two.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: seriously, i was afk for a minute, do any bid 3@d as a rebid instead of 2@s by W?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|ady: heart lead in CR   declarer played a club  west went in with ace and switched to a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: the main reason for leading a diamond there is you are worried declarer will throw his diamond losers on dummy clubs (or less likely hearts) but you do have the @CA and partner ...|pg||

nt|hawe45:  I try it once more: 1) West opens 1 @S 2) East knows for 110 %, which suit we shall play 3) ThatÂ´s why 2 @C is the best answer - EAST must know Wests hand - how difficult can it be|pg||
nt|pelu: slam again|pg||
mb|1N|nt|riccho: Maybe 1@s 2@h 2@s 3@s would have been nf|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Again...???|pg||
nt|mcarroll: As W I would be trying to find pd's entry, I know i will look foolish if S does not have a @D stopper but a 2NT bid will pretty well guarantee at least one stop|pg||
mb|2H!|an|transfer, at least 4!ss|nt|h_karluk: 25 hcp normally with both balanced hands could be a game try, we'll see|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3NT or 4 @s? |pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: what about 1@S 3@H?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2nd i guess|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but as you know it's all abt their hand evaluation and decision|pg||
mb|3C|an|max with 4!ss|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  due to @d small doubleton - more probably|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sfoxa:  there are no preempts after preempt, so 4@s is showing what S has|pg||
nt|jcwla: Maybe 3@H is four and a min?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This 12-14 puts 6 @H on the best seat|pg||
nt|riccho: Not a sequence to get W exactly excited... |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry, no transfer - the other way, I sleep on|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 3C maybe breaks xfer , i meant liked it and encourages|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: the danes also missed the slam on board 16|pg||
nt|riccho: A club lead may get to a failed slma|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the light 1nt has stolen this hand|pg||
nt|riccho: slam I mean|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sabine Auken found a double of 1@S-2@S, let alone 1@S-1NT here, and made 3@C on 14 to go with her teammates' 2@S, a gain of 6.|pg||
nt|april7: take ace,pull trumps and discard @C Q and then hope in @S|pg||
nt|jcwla: Then they set 1NT on 15 whereas 2@S made here, that accounts for the other 4 (on 15).|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  seems so - what is the other reason for S bids game? |pg||
nt|mcarroll: -1 losing 2 trump, 1@C and 1@D|pg||
pc|h6|nt|peachy: neither side can make much of anything|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a mixed blessing though as this may go down 2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hard position for W - each lead may help declarer|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  what are the best chance for playing @s for 1 loser only?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||

pc|c5|nt|po-s: club lead as in the other room, now a wspade back simpified for declarer|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|s5|nt|sfoxa:  depends on pair's aggrement. some plays that preempt suit is agreed at once, so new bid is a cue|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  Kelsey said that the speed of passing in such situation differs beginner from expert|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In Denmark a lot of players play 2 @D for at very bad weak-2, and open 2 @H/@S with a reasonable hand|pg||
nt|riccho: not espec what suits me|pg||
nt|jcwla: "It's systemic" is good to know but not relevant to an evaluation of it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: imo, there is no thinking about it |pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: west with his eyes up in the air after the @s9 appeared|pg||
mb|1D|an|15+, 4+!hs|mb|p|nt|riccho: I guess that this sort of style comes from the times when the undertricks dbld nv were cheaper than today|pg||
mb|2N|an|!h raise|nt|sybarra: "free insurance"  here and white |pg||
nt|sybarra: as long as not pushed to slam |pg||
nt|sybarra: but no slam here so ok to push |pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  W could try level 5, but already this will be a disaster|pg||
nt|sybarra: whack!|pg||
nt|sybarra: depends now on what X means |pg||
nt|rnmalik: on his bid of 2@H, N promised @S and a minor-x would show that minor.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not at all|pg||
nt|pelu: bridge is bidders game - not my style, but it works for them|pg||
nt|jcwla: What do you like by S hand over 1@S?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2NT  a type of Jacoby - value raise to 3@H|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  thank to spectator, I got the link to NS system. their 1@s opening   could be from 9 points if 5/4 majors|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, S was in accordance with the system|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: X could mean "my other suit" or "not my other suit"  probably on pg 286 of system notes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  another approach is dbl = we don't defend|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Like South did|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|riccho: 2@s = inv fit or better seems reasonable here (5c MAJ)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and 1@d meant 15+ points and 4+ @h|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: 3@S if a fit jump is possible with north hand, i am not keen on 3d but seems to have done no harm|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||

nt|hawe45:  To be honest - partner opens third hand - what else could you bid?????|pg||

pc|h2|nt|riccho: NT? |pg||
nt|april7: second hand!|pg||
nt|riccho: neg X with 33 in m? |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Never - North shall bid NT, if that is our game|pg||
nt|riccho: exactly|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry, second hand|pg||
nt|pelu: same contract in OR|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I wonder direct 1@h opening in their CC or not, cant wait to see that sample|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4-0 trump break unwelcome but should noy prove insurmountable|pg||
pc|d4|pc|hK|nt|sybarra: these system notes for established partnerships are very long and remarkably complex |pg||
nt|jcwla: Neg X a possibility -- in any case after 2@S I would go to boys' room and ask kib to put down dummy's trumps.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: not|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  direct 1@h opening is 10-14 with 4+ @h or exactly 10-11 points 5332 with @h |pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: seems so|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3C relay, 3H names th stiff|pg||

nt|caitlin: 3@C asks  3@H tells|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: but 4@s a better contract|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still a chance in case dislike game to stop at 3 @s|pg||
nt|ritong: nicely judged by south anyway|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|riccho: homepage for the event is on again: http://www.german-bridge-trophy.de/|pg||
nt|caitlin: the singleton heart is of value to North who has two heart losers|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I liked North's hand evaluation|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|sfoxa:  that looks like a push|pg||

nt|h_karluk: and South used a convention in correct time|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mcarroll: @D as suggested by Paul works |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|h_karluk: yes, but also declarer has to make it|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  for that class players, you can count on "obvious" action |pg||

pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|athene: with this shape and just a fraction more HCP south could double 1nt, t/o of spades|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: but as it is, i doubt they will get into the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: especially with west stealing their suit|pg||

nt|athene: declarer playing for some sort of slip in defence giving him an endplay or something|pg||
nt|ady: defence went wrong|pg||
nt|pelu: the signals didn't work for NS|pg||
nt|athene: the defence perhaps went wrong because of the 2@C bid|pg||

nt|fabsayc: you would be barred from any euro country for passing|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: another misfit|pg||
nt|peachy: just didnt work this time, but reasoanble decision|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 1@S or 1@H ?|pg||
nt|peachy: the modern trend is to open any 12|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok now the thanks as we are on last hand |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it's good agreement - if the opening lead suit isn't promising (like @d here), second defender signal suit preference|pg||
nt|sybarra: Many thanks, to our operator Lukas Schenk .  A job well done!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzkk: last board for this match|pg||
nt|jcwla: One last chance to break the blitz.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and a bad contract in OR|pg||
nt|riccho: 3NT = is a useful result for denmark in the open|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: i might open @H and reverse... great hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh ....|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sunsamvar: 6@H ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: My co-co's  you were thanked already,  and truely appreciate your help |pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: last board for this round! The next match is the Women-Fight Germany vs. Denmark|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks Shirley, Sveta and all the specs. |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  TY, Shirley, as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: Our gratitude to the German Bridge Federation (Peter Eidt) |pg||
nt|sybarra: all BBO vugraph fans appreciate it |pg||
nt|riccho: ahh|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks operator and fellow commentators also kibbers, you are always welcomed, stay with us please. This is another busy week on BBO Vugraph theatre|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the relative suit quality suggests 1S and this is well short of my idea of a reverse|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks Lukas, Roland, Hans, Hamdi, Peter, Richard, Avram, all specs.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: the next is France-Poland in the Open Tournament|pg||
nt|riccho: I have to admit that I dont agree here with passing 1@d either|pg||
nt|riccho: Neither with N or with E... :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks all|pg||
nt|pelu: no pass - NO X from S!!!|pg||
nt|jcwla: "Me or your lying eyes?"|pg||
nt|riccho: and the X from S is unbelievable|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Double on a 5 count??|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 8+ is quite normal, but 5?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Break for dinner after this board. Restart at 20.30 local time, in about 40 minutes (we don't know which match yet)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Apologies to Lone Bilde|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: i am sorry...|pg||
nt|riccho: this could get interesting|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No problem, Lukas|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: gotta go now... very late here... wife cribbing :)|pg||
nt|peachy: i also like more hard values for reverse|pg||
nt|sybarra: and of course to our specs.....you are the best!!!  thx for the info, the humor, and kind suggestions |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|peachy: thanks Sunil, have a good night|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 5 loser hand is a reverse in my book|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Back at 15.55 local time, in about 20 minutes|pg||
nt|riccho: the 1st bidding was a bit surealistic|pg||
nt|jcwla: Take a look at the rest of the set before you send that letter.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but it will start - that the thing|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sunsamvar: suits are good too|pg||
nt|peachy: it is a play strong hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: time enough to make coffee :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that 5 loser is about 8 loser unless a fit found|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes and few losers if fit is found|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: N must be thinking now given the 3 @D bid |pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: but reversing does not leave options, you can show playing strength latter if a fit found|pg||
nt|peachy: Anyway, I would not reverse, prefer the raw HCP for it|pg||
pc|c4|nt|riccho: some imps for denmark here|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|peachy: not point counter, but still|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i bid on plg strenght|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sunsamvar: i wd open a 8 point 6-5 ... this is much stronger :)|pg||
nt|peachy: this strength can be shown in other ways|pg||
nt|fabsayc: losing trick count should be applied only AFTER  a fit found|pg||
nt|peachy: agree on distributional openers, sure!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: NS may reach 5@D here too as in OR but may not be X.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and not doubled will bring it home for Neth |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4 imps in a close math:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: match.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|riccho: 7+4 u mean... :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: with the bid and raise, of @S's S is pretty sure N has at most 1 sp |pg||
nt|riccho: But denmark tries to lose them|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sunsamvar: and in my book equal ti a 16 point 5422|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC_2010/10_05_12_dma.html|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rnmalik: I mean 18+4=22|pg||
nt|sybarra: good reason not to touch  trump here|pg||
pc|c6|nt|peachy: 16point 5422 is pretty much a minimum hand:)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but Martin the chnces for  fit with a 2 suiter is doubled :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: join the 6h crowd, i think despite no top losers this is a poor slam|pg||
nt|riccho: I cannot understand 4@c here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not DK's day against Germany, losing at ice hockey, losing at bridge|pg||
nt|jcwla: "I didn't come to defend 3@D.  Well I didn't come to defend 4@C."|pg||
nt|riccho: Impossible to be a good contract|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sunsamvar: i wd be in 6@H too after opening 1@H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: opeing distributional gets u in trouble if P doubles ...SURE .... but land u in good games |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 2nd call from wifey :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: see u all... enjoy the rest of the session all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: take care of family :)|pg||
