pc|d9|nt|jbgood: :)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c3|pg||
nt|barnets: I am sure if he needed 8 helgemo would get them but he needs 9|pg||
nt|dburn: not clear he will have that much trouble - North may need to play a heart now to beat him|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room Meckstroth will open 2@C -- not sure if they'll end up in 2@C/2N or probably 3@C|pg||
nt|barnets: we can see a possible 8th in hearts|pg||
nt|jbgood: they bid 3 NT in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or  i could have waited and just said   3N in other room - but from East|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: you could hear a pin drop at this table it is so quiet|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Weinstein leads @S8 from South -- East hand only known to be 6+@C, not 4@H/@S, decent 11-15 hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: 3 of the four have their hands on their chins|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dburn: well, he may get one more chance|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|dburn: but if Helgemo ducks a club now, Platnick had better play a heart|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Isn't that too late now?|pg||

pc|s9|nt|barnets: a decent contract with a finesse through the opening bidder and a reasonable spade break|pg||

pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: and another swing position -- Weinstein playing 4@D from south|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: I have a feelinng that Levin-Weinstein have caught up, but of course we don't know what other pairs behind them have done|pg||

nt|Walddk2: In fact, we know nothing at all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice defense -- Helgemo never had a chance with @HK offside|pg||
mc|8|nt|Walddk2: Yes, they could have had running scores if the organizers wanted to, but they have decided against due to security issues|pg||
nt|barnets: levin- weinstein have won the cavendish more times than any other pair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So we will know nothing till it's all over after board 27|pg||
nt|barnets: t|pg||
nt|barnets: at|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and weinstein has one win without levin|pg||
nt|barnets: that is why they went for 62000$ in the auction|pg||
