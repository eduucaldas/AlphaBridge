mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: 2@D artificial ask for more info |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 4@H or 4@S|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: 2@S asks which  3@C=@S   [2N would show 4@H]|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@S=game try|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: sorry -- i couldn't stop myself|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room  Casen EAST playing 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Ruff diamond play spade ruff next diamond play spade and I TINk you will be OK|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: as we say he stole the pot in 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I believe Peter Weichsel developed this scheme of bidding over Precision 2@C - but not 100% positive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Casen had easy 1@D overcall of 1@C   much harder for Fu over 2@C at these colors|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Left is jack and Right is Meck http://cavendishinvitational.com/webcam/2/table2.jpg|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: welcome to Roland Wald|pg||
nt|kareno: Still and all, passing has its own risks.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good evening/afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: I dread 4 of a major with this trump holding|pg||
nt|kareno: Roland :)  Al :)|pg||
nt|kareno: David :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hi Karen, Roland|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the weak trump suit shows how powerful distribution can overcome honor strength|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and good morning to our many viewers in Oz and NZ|pg||
nt|kareno: South obviously not in love with it either.  The concern is getting your trumps drawn and diamonds run.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: or @C 3-3|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: OK last time here - next to Meck is NOT repeat NOT a calculator - he doesnt need one|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: It is a bridgemate used forsending table scores to the scoring room|pg||

nt|ahollan1: hmmm  1 round of @C then @H isn't a line i thought about|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: I think he will be a trick short now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only if they cash two more rounds of trumps|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzjf: Interesting card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most of us were probably wondering what to do after @CK at trick 3 with Jack Zhao playing @CJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Webcam http://cavendishinvitational.com/webcam/2/table2.jpg|pg||

nt|vugraphzjf: Ruff club and play spade best here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was thinking  @CK @C [and pray] |pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, cash the club winner first|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: I dont think he need to cash the club winner all roads lead to rome except @HK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the question is  rely upon @C3-3 or  @H3-3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|s4|pc|c8|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|c5|nt|kareno: Exactly.  And he's gone wrong.  Now overtake and play diamond works well for the D|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Ah yes sorry blind spot here|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: good overtake   bad @SQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: As did defender|pg||
nt|kareno: Nope, that won't work. as south will soon claim.|pg||
mc|10|nt|ahollan1: what a roller coaster ride|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Jack passing his opinion of the defence under the screen to his partner|pg||

nt|vugraphzjf: Getting to game is no certainty|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Jack slams his cards on the table and takes a deep sigh|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=11-15 HCP|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: i think Jack told his pd if he does not overtake @SK Jack would play @H back trump @SA and @D return for sure down|pg||
nt|kareno: How many would make a Michaels intervention at once with the east hand?  I would - decent suits.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Just -1 is it|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Karen - which way do YOU go with East hand over 1@H?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kareno: Oops - cancel Michaels - I thought I saw 5-5|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: You did see 5-5|pg||
nt|kareno: Or, if he was 5/5 I affirm bidding michaels|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kareno: I hate being shut out of spades :)|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: max score on any one hand is 17 * 22|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: So played as pairs but with IMP scoring - overtricks not vital making contract is|pg||
nt|kareno: It is the one format of event I won't play as it happens.  Different top on every board.|pg||
