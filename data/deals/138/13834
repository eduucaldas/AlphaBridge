nt|petergill: Kaplans Rubens Evaluator suggests South has 15.05 pointshttp://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=a6+a82+q6+a96542 , so 1NT was OK I guess|pg||
nt|fifee: now i cant find the chat program lol|pg||
nt|petergill: ref http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=a6+a82+q6+a96542|pg||
nt|dburn:  ...nowadays it seems mainstream that when you have an eight count, you should invite game facing a strong no trump|pg||

nt|vugraphzjf: Perhaps Bramley should have ruffed a @d first but didnt matter|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C was the inevitable "minus one"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Smith-Cohen in 2@H on that hand   Billy Cohen opened 1@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: interesting options for south|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjf: Helness folds up his cards and stares at the auction|pg||
nt|petergill: With a trump fit, looking for penalties on the South cards would be fraught with danger|pg||
mb|p|an|finally|pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: this may take some time with Bart at the helm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm in a loop even looking at all 52 cards|pg||
nt|dburn:  it would take some time with Donald Campbell at the helm|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: who is Donald Campbell?|pg||
nt|petergill: Bart Bramley has to consider how to play if trumps are 4-1|pg||
nt|dburn:  the mane who broke the world speed record on water|pg||
nt|petergill: world land speed record holder for a while|pg||
nt|po-s: or diamonds 5-2|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
nt|dburn:  and the land speed record also, but that was only because he was trying to stop the boat|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: 10 min|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Bart apologises|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H now?  but then what   |pg||

pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|petergill: but he didn't play bridge  |pg||
nt|dburn:  perhaps he didn't have the time|pg||

nt|vugraphzjf: concedes 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: 4-3 you mean|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: oops  right 3-2 & 4-3|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Helgemo checks range|pg||
nt|dburn:  mind you, Donald Campbell might have played it faster, but he could not have played it more accurately|pg||
mb|2D!|an|one suited major|nt|petergill: The significant "world" records I know of are: Fastest Played Hand 0.1 seconds, Slowest Played Hand in Australia: 138 minutes Wilfred Wallace in the 1950s in a big match - perhaps ...|pg||
nt|petergill: non-Aussies can beat that?|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H!|an|unsuggesting it|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: final analysis from Wlifred  ---  a)  it was cold   b) no problem  c) oh, is it my turn to play|pg||
mb|p|an|very begrudgingly|nt|vugraphzjf: Next round deKniff Wrang vs Bessis squared|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|petergill: Wilfred did play it right. His Victorian opponents asked if they could take their lunch break while he thought. No problem. The hand could not be included in the official History ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Of Australian Bridge due to lack of confirmation and possibility of being exaggerated. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: I wont be on last round cause the pair I own will be on VG|pg||

nt|vugraphzjf: Casen Passell|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D MultiLandy or a version thereof, Dbl = @Ds, Pass showed 5+ @d's I think. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Barry - don't know if everybody agrees, but i've loved your at-the-table color commentary today|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: what do you mean TODAY?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think i was at your table yesterday ???|pg||

mc|7|nt|petergill: North would have unblocked @SQ if he needed to. He knew he didn't need to, as West is marked with 3+ spades (no 2@H response by South to 1NT) and 6+ @H's and only one @D (no @D ...|pg||
