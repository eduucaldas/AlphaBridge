mb|p|mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=5+@D or 4@D(441)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: 3NT will be a popular contract all over the place|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: It's a big PLACE with 23 tables|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|Walddk2: A contract they will all make|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|ahollan1: Helness didn't bid with Welland hand, so Elinescu EAST bid 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Lots of asking and writing going on here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: 2NT known as good/bad. 3@C would have shown extras|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: CC doesn't talk about de Knijff's DBL :(|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|po-s: I wonder if they are on the same wavelength|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: I think one AM and one FM|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Someone give East the blue card|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: I actuallyy think de Knijff was thinking about it|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: He sort of reached for it and then pulled back - will probably blame being on BBO for not doing it in case it was BAD|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can defense hold to ONLY 1 overtrick?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: defence can take 2 spades and a heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Screen has been up and down up and down|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||

mc|10|nt|Walddk2: This may not quite be 22 x 5 IMPs to the leaders, but it's close. I can't imagine that many will double, if any|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Discussion taking place over alerts and director summoned|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: http://cavendishinvitational.com/webcam/2/table2.jpg to see dirctor in action|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In our other room Helness (North) did not overcall. Not their style|pg||
nt|po-s: I have a feeling the 2NT was some kind of good-bad 2NT intending to show clubs and a bad hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If it's yours, perhaps you need better cards before you double|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm still wondering about de Knijff's DBL|pg||
nt|po-s: it couldn´t be a penalty double - or could it?|pg||

nt|vugraphzjf: The double was for a heartg lead. The issue is whether east's double was alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: OKmoving right along|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Curiously, I have just been watching a 20/20 match. Many specs will know what I'm referring to|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|vugraphzjf: cricket for those who dont|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and the 20/20 here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=10-21 HCP, normally NOT 5332|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The chance of both sides having 20 hcp is roughly 7%|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure why 2nd suit not shown|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Scores to the end of session 2 http://cavendishinvitational.com/2010/PAIRS5O.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think it was with 2@H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: The Swedish NPC, Jan Kamras, is in the audience. Maybe he can shed some light|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: This is a pretty yucky contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reasonable explanation from spec -- maybe Negative Free Bids so de Knijff DBL either Negative or STRONG|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: inundated by specs  2@H shows 4+@C|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: No club switch now is best|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Inverted Häxan (Swedish convention)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: Häxan = the Witch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C would be 6+ H weak or any strong hand not suited for a 2NT rebid|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|sT|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|po-s: finessing seems only chance to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wladow - playing a Big Club system i think -  didn't think West worth 1@H opening|pg||
pc|d4|pc|sK|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: He did finesse but not the way he needed to and a strange way with no entry|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s2|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Willenken brings the screen down to ask a question|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Willenken is running out of exit cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: @D10 floating to his hand|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most use DBL of 2@C as lead-director, so too tough for Wrang to bid|pg||
nt|po-s: agree, I think even a coward like me would have doubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: I know how to aplogise if it is wrong but dont know how to aplogise for NOT doubling|pg||
