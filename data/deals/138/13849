nt|barnets: west will make his 3 aces - thats all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Game missed in the other room, mainly because of NT range|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was with the odds for Fredin to raise to game, not so in the other room when South showed 12-14|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW upside-down attitude, std count, Smith vs NT|pg||
nt|barnets: of course south does not know everthing is breaking so well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: By the way, Fredin does not invite; either he passes or bids games, and bidding is more frequent|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10 tricks in 1NT in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another good result for Levin-Weinstein|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Fallenius is folding and reopening his cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14-16 is a lucky NT range on this deal|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
