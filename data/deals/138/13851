mb|1D|an|could be 2|nt|flash: nebulous 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: cautious pass by Levin|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lc: No overcall.  I suppose I shouldn't have supposed.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|d|nt|lc: Now, X shows something like this.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcmax: maybe e is hoping to be able to dbl @H for t/o later?|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: Larry - some will take more risks to overcall 2@C over 1@D (or 1@S over 1@C) because of the all the room it takes up?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: There is debate, though as to wheter it is "@H takeout" or @D strength".  Here it is both.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Sabine's favorite bid (she wrote) is to overcall a minor with the other minor -- right Sabine?|pg||
nt|jcmax: And the 2nd dbl shows it was both :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: True Larry :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lc: So, Sabine, you would have overcalled 2@C and we would not have had this excitment.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|flash: 2-way finesse in @Ss for the contract??|pg||
nt|lc: One of my fears is to double for takeout with a void (as here by LEvin.) I say "Avoid" doubling with voids.|pg||
nt|jcmax: depending on how declarer guesses this hand I may have slept etter tonight, though :)|pg||
nt|lc: Afraid of a leave-in -- and without trumps to play it is hard to defend.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|flash: Ace and a @H would have given up 1 trick, but perhaps gained 2??|pg||
nt|jcmax: It didn't take declarer very long to guess those @S!|pg||
nt|lc: Still, I have to admit, I would have X'ed 2@H with Levin's hand had a chosen to not overcall 2@C originally.|pg||
nt|lc: Surely, Weinstein's leave in was "automatic"|pg||
nt|lc: It is so disappointing as defenders when dummy hits with that 3rd trump in this situation.|pg||
nt|jcmax: At the other table helgemo bid 31S on his 3-car suit instead. but there N had raised to 2@H directly|pg||
nt|lc: Sure -- if North has raised @H, it makes leaving in the double less appealing.|pg||
nt|lc: Needless to say, -670 is a large disaster at this form of scoring and will surely make it tough for L-W to win the event (based on everything we've seen so far in this final ...|pg||
nt|lc: session).|pg||
nt|jcmax: W knows this contract cannot be beaten, but is desperately trying to find a straw|pg||
nt|flash: this round will take us past the halfway point of the session|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|lc: West is pretty much at "double-dummy" even though it is the 3rd trick.  He doesn't know who has the @CJ, but knows the rest,|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|pg||
nt|flash: again, the wild card in all this is  De Knijff - Wrang; they were in 3rd place overnight and we have no idea of how they're doing today|pg||
nt|lc: Surely, they can pass both pairs we've been watching, yes.  It seems the pairs who started 1-2 are "small plus" on the day.|pg||
nt|jcmax: How long will it be after the last board is played till the results come out, Jim?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|s8|pc|h5|pg||
nt|flash: so far, Catalina has been able to get us preliminary results through 8 rounds while the 9th is being played|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|h3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|h4|pc|d8|pg||
pc|cT|nt|flash: since they're recording the results tableside, using Bridgemates, we haven't had too long a wait for preminary final results|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|mc|8|nt|flash: however, they've had large problems with scoring errors|pg||
pg||

nt|vugraphzje: of course!!|pg||
nt|lc: Everyone kind of knew what everyone had very early in the deal.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|flash: and have repeated a plea in the Daily Bulletin for E-W to actually look at the score before they press the OK button|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lc: Perfect hand for plain old lebensohl here.|pg||
nt|lc: West bids 3NT to show a 3NT bid with NO heart stopper.|pg||
mb|3N!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: yes, the scoring errors are a typical problem. Most people just always press the OK button on the bridgemate without even looking at the display....|pg||
nt|lc: If he had a 3NT bid WITH a @H stopper, he'd relay first with 2NT (to a forced 3@C) then bid 3NT.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lc: This way is called "FAST DENIES"|pg||
nt|lc: So, the "fast" or "direct" 3nt denies a @H stopper.|pg||
nt|lc: East has @H stopped so he passes 3NT.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lc: Of course, nobody said anything about @D stoppers! :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|lc: But, E-W will soon be pleased to see the suit 4-4.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sK|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h2|nt|lc: Or even more please with a shift :)|pg||

nt|jcmax: Interesting signalling situation. Here there were 3 @D in dummy, so no problem. But let's suppose there were only 2. how would N signal with 5 cards in @D?|pg||
mb|1C|an|strong|nt|lc: Yes -- that would have been an unsolvable problem in standard methods.|pg||
nt|lc: Strong 1@C|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d!|nt|lc: X as 5-8 |pg||
nt|lc: Likely, I'd say -- any shape.|pg||
nt|lc: Most big @C pairs use the X in this way.  Says nothing about shape.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lc: Now 3@S P 4@S|pg||
mb|d!|nt|lc: Then again.... :)|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose South is bringing @H into the picture -- which might not be such a good idea on this occassion.|pg||
nt|flash: keeping @Hs in play??|pg||
mb|4C|nt|flash: E-W taking full advantage of vulnerability|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|lc: Hmm -- the next X might be a real one.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Since 4-major rates to fail, 4@C doubled would not be good for E-W.|pg||
nt|lc: South appears to have to lose 2 tricks in each red suit.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|lc: Is there a way to avoid the 2nd @h loser -- that is the question.|pg||
nt|flash: there seem to be some end-play possibilities?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|lc: Looking at all the cards, there are lots of interesting options.|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe all the E-W bidding will provide some clues -- this could be interesting.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|lc: Surely, declarer knows West has lots of shape for his 4@C bid.  Once he shows up with 2@S, he is likely to be short in @H.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|s3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d6|pg||
nt|lc: Grue seems to be on to a good thing here.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|d5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|lc: Grue is one of those declarers who is NOT fun to defend against.  It's a nice quality to have.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lc: No doubt Grue expects 4-1 @H from the 4@C bid.|pg||
nt|flash: if he were sure of that split, he'd've played low by now?|pg||
nt|lc: Would West bid 4@C with 2=2=3=6?  Not likely.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lc: Hmmmm.|pg||
mc|9|nt|lc: I think he should have worked it out.|pg||
nt|lc: But, I see all 52 cards :)|pg||
nt|flash: i'm told 4@S was made against H&H??|pg||
nt|lc: He played West for  @SJx  @Hxx  @DAKx  @CQJxxxx -- not a 4@C bid.|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: closing table|pg||
nt|flash: East's raise to 3@C may have helped confuse matters?  |pg||
