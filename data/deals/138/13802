mb|1C!|nt|ahollan1: both pairs play a forcing 1@C that is NOT necessarily strong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as we see here, 1@C can include weak NT |pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|ahollan1: Baltic Club  is different from Polish 1@C|pg||
nt|poohbear: AH?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|dburn:  Brink may need to give his partner some leeway here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzjf: Hmmm not sure why it is safer to bid 2@H now and wasnt at the one level|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|ahollan1: this is similar to barometer in that all tables play the same boards at the same time -- players can discuss results between rounds, but scores are NOT posted|pg||
mb|3H|nt|poohbear: It is often a good idea to be aggressive competing over a Polish @c auction since they are unsure of minor suit lengths and whether partner has a good hand or a weak NT|pg||
nt|dburn:  Brink still trying for game, but East-West have found their fit also|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: often you can steal the partial|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: NOW @S -- over 2@H 2@S would/should  probably show longer suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Smirnov throws up his arms in resignation|pg||
nt|dburn:  should have put a double card in one of his arms before doing that|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: http://cavendishinvitational.com/webcam/2/table2.jpg Smirnov Left drijver Right|pg||
nt|poohbear: NS way overboard|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Way=2 tricks|pg||

nt|jcwla: i'm not in love with 1@D|pg||
nt|dburn:  still, he could not tell that two hearts would stand up and that he would have two club tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: I dont mind 1@D as I would be pleased to get a diamond lead and I have some values|pg||
pc|h3|nt|poohbear: @d lead good against NT . not necessarily against a suit|pg||

nt|vugraphzjf: Yes the fourth highest is easy|pg||
nt|poohbear: prob default @h lead due to the spots|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzjf: Sorry my fingers bumping the mouse pad|pg||
pc|h5|nt|poohbear: Declarer will prob lead a low @c up while retaining the ace |pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Agree|pg||
nt|poohbear: he will prob run @ss first. though doing that will give away alot of info to the defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H8 lead is 2nd/4th|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: http://cavendishinvitational.com/webcam/1/table1.jpg Thomas Bessis on left and Bompis on right|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzjf: Certainly not a challenging lead for declarer|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S = 11-18|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: 1N = one-round force|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjf: 1@C is Forcing 1NT 14-17|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjf: The 4-1 trump bteak may make this problematic but the friendly spade break may help|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Not to mention dimaond onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: And @DQJ bare|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I wonder if 2N was forcing|pg||
nt|poohbear: problem is no entry to dummy to cash @ss|pg||
nt|poohbear: I doubt it|pg||
nt|poohbear: trump lead is a stick out here in my opinion|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: i wondered because finishing 5431 shape with a non-max |pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: I think defence best served with heart lead with opportunities to shorten dummy while north holds four trumps|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
nt|poohbear: EW limited values  . Ruffs in short hand needed to make 11 most likely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS udca|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Not surpringly declarer thinking how to tackle this hand. It is these types of hands that you MUST get right to do well in this event|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: declarer has been massaging  the spade four for some time now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i keep trying lines with @SQ or J at trick 2 but get stuck in a loop :(|pg||
