mb|p|nt|brolucius: If North is able to open 1NT, West can enter the bidding.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As a tribute to Mr Bird, we are now introducing a most challenging 1NT contract|pg||

mb|p|nt|ludewig: of course|pg||
nt|brolucius: Absolutely. |pg||

pc|s5|nt|brolucius: I was looking at a deal only this morning, where Brogeland and Lindkvist bid to a slam at Game All, after the opponents had opened with a strong 1NT. Their entry to the auction was ...|pg||

nt|jcwla: Not such an easy lead for E but a @H would work well.  Hackett has chosen a low @D, which violates Kieran Dyke's rule.|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  quite peacefull board for warm-up|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cards are favourably placed and we can see it. |pg||
nt|jcwla: Good idea to lead bid majors on the go against NT when the other partner has not shown any support for them; but not, as here, when N should have at least two.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Like I told you - they are optimists|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: this should be a similar 2@S contract|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brolucius: North might have doubled 1NT (for take-out of spades) at the other table.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|daman: right|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Auken doubles even 2@S, much bolder than her counterpart at the other table.|pg||
nt|daman: I thought the auction might be the same    it wasn't|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|brolucius: This seems to be a possible misunderstanding as to the meaning of 2NT - unlikely as that is from such an experienced partnership (former world champions).|pg||
nt|ludewig: 1444 and 11 points does not seem too bold, but leads to an uncomfortable contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She is close to making 9 tricks|pg||
nt|brolucius: Kibitzers suggest that 2NT was a Scramble. But why should South want to scramble with 12 points facing a double?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Three clubs, three diamonds and two aces, and there may be a 9th somewhere|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|ludewig: I think Daniela hoped for a 5 card minor , so 2NT was scrambling|pg||
nt|vugraphzkj: it was scrambling|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|c2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Why should partner not hold 13 points, when 25 might give them game?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Auken does not mind being forced, thereby scoring small trumps|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d4|pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d7|nt|brolucius: Still, if the meaning of 2NT is scramble (which may well be the most useful meaning for the bid), then you do have a bit of a problem on the South hand. You either have to pot 3NT ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: or give up on game. A guess either way.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @HK, ruff, overruffed, spade would have been good for the defence|pg||
nt|po-s: Interesting - many (most?) pairs play some kind of Lebensohl in this situation - and isnÂ´t Daniela very cautious with her 12 hp?|pg||
nt|ludewig: probably going down 1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hard to explain why Bekkouche did not exit with @HK|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: X could mean "my other suit" or "not my other suit"  probably on pg 286 of system notes|pg||

nt|ludewig: actually 7 on spade finesse and Clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4NT by West would have shown 3 keycards for hearts, so 5@C showed 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are showing instead of asking|pg||
nt|ludewig: good approach, saves space|pg||
mb|5S|nt|po-s: David is too young, Roland|pg||

nt|brolucius: Too young for some things and too old for others.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ludewig: thinking about 7|pg||

nt|brolucius: Which would be way too much on these values.|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Maybe she does not think she is worth it without @HQ|pg||
nt|daman: what a coup it would be to bid the grand salami|pg||
nt|po-s: If East has the SK instead - and CJ instead of the DJ - then garns. Well tried by West|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|po-s: ...then grand - sorry, but her cuebids might seem confusing, they are cues|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C is moderate grand slam interest without @HQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Known as the Formula 7 convention|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is all too much. We can see that hearts are 3-2 and clubs 3-3. But they will not be all the time.|pg||
nt|ludewig: from Wests point of view 7 must be bad opposite 19-20|pg||
nt|po-s: AKx.AJTx,Axx,KJx|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ludewig: yes perfect hand|pg||
nt|ludewig: actually 7 is easier to play than 6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then she would have shown big interest in grand slam without @HQ|pg||
nt|po-s: so must not be bad - only wishful thinking|pg||
nt|brolucius: I forget which wise person it was who advised: do not play partner for the perfect hand. He/she does not have it.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|brolucius: Maybe Bob Hamman.|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|brolucius: It would be more reasonable to overcall 1@S on such a weak suit because at least then you would cut out a 1@H response from North. |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|brolucius: I would not expect more than one player in four to overcall on those West cards and maybe very much fewer than that. |pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||

nt|brolucius: Since the contract was cold, I was dozing off and missed P.O's excellent joke. That will teach me.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: North will teach West what a 1@H overcall looks like. Yes.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only 8 tricks in 3NT for E-W|pg||
nt|daman: 2@D seems a bid rich|pg||
mb|2H|nt|daman: bit*|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@D is OK if the opening promises at least four cards.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|daman: correct    but I would still pass 1@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are experiencing internet problems all over Germany I am told, so the tournament website is down I'm afraid. Therefore, we can't give you results from other matches|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess Auken can be endplayed for the 9th trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But Nadia Bekkouche has to read it well|pg||
nt|daman: I think thery might make 3NT on some form of endplay perhaps|pg||
nt|daman: :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, North will have a choice of three suits in which to give declarer a ninth trick.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer strips North's diamonds and throws her in with the third round of hearts.|pg||

pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: I notice that the organizers spell East's first name with a  j. However, that is not correct, it's Nadia with an  i|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|brolucius: She could only afford to play two rounds of diamonds before the throw-in because she will need a diamond entry to dummy after a heart return from North.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not quite|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She can get off dummy with a low spade|pg||
nt|ludewig: small Spade at the end will do|pg||
nt|ludewig: but risky, requires N to have everything|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|d8|pc|sQ|pc|h9|nt|daman: her options are limited|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|d9|pc|cT|pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Indeed George; she has no other option ... unless she thinks Sabine has bared @CA|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h8|nt|ludewig: Exit with @H10 after two rounds of Diamonds would have been more comfortable|pg||
pc|h5|nt|brolucius: Yes, that would avoid any guess.|pg||
nt|brolucius: This will be more annoying for N/S if declarer takes a second-best line, relying on a guess, and still manages to make it.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ludewig: If North had kept all spades the decl would have to find a discard after the third round of hearts|pg||
nt|ludewig: now it is easier to play North for 5431|pg||

nt|fabsayc: you would be barred from any euro country for passing|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: another misfit|pg||
nt|peachy: just didnt work this time, but reasoanble decision|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 1@S or 1@H ?|pg||
nt|peachy: the modern trend is to open any 12|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok now the thanks as we are on last hand |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it's good agreement - if the opening lead suit isn't promising (like @d here), second defender signal suit preference|pg||
nt|sybarra: Many thanks, to our operator Lukas Schenk .  A job well done!|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzkk: last board for this match|pg||
nt|jcwla: One last chance to break the blitz.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and a bad contract in OR|pg||
nt|riccho: 3NT = is a useful result for denmark in the open|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sunsamvar: i might open @H and reverse... great hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh ....|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: 6@H ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: My co-co's  you were thanked already,  and truely appreciate your help |pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: last board for this round! The next match is the Women-Fight Germany vs. Denmark|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks Shirley, Sveta and all the specs. |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  TY, Shirley, as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: Our gratitude to the German Bridge Federation (Peter Eidt) |pg||
nt|sybarra: all BBO vugraph fans appreciate it |pg||
nt|riccho: ahh|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the relative suit quality suggests 1S and this is well short of my idea of a reverse|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks Lukas, Roland, Hans, Hamdi, Peter, Richard, Avram, all specs.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: the next is France-Poland in the Open Tournament|pg||
nt|riccho: I have to admit that I dont agree here with passing 1@d either|pg||
nt|riccho: Neither with N or with E... :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks all|pg||
nt|pelu: no pass - NO X from S!!!|pg||
nt|jcwla: "Me or your lying eyes?"|pg||
nt|riccho: and the X from S is unbelievable|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Double on a 5 count??|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 8+ is quite normal, but 5?|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk4: Apologies to Lone Bilde|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: i am sorry...|pg||
nt|riccho: this could get interesting|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No problem, Lukas|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: gotta go now... very late here... wife cribbing :)|pg||
nt|peachy: i also like more hard values for reverse|pg||
nt|sybarra: and of course to our specs.....you are the best!!!  thx for the info, the humor, and kind suggestions |pg||
mb|1S|nt|peachy: thanks Sunil, have a good night|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 5 loser hand is a reverse in my book|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Back at 15.55 local time, in about 20 minutes|pg||
nt|riccho: the 1st bidding was a bit surealistic|pg||
nt|jcwla: Take a look at the rest of the set before you send that letter.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sunsamvar: suits are good too|pg||
nt|peachy: it is a play strong hand|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sybarra: time enough to make coffee :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|fabsayc: that 5 loser is about 8 loser unless a fit found|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes and few losers if fit is found|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: N must be thinking now given the 3 @D bid |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but reversing does not leave options, you can show playing strength latter if a fit found|pg||
nt|peachy: Anyway, I would not reverse, prefer the raw HCP for it|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho: some imps for denmark here|pg||
mb|4C|nt|peachy: not point counter, but still|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i bid on plg strenght|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: i wd open a 8 point 6-5 ... this is much stronger :)|pg||
nt|peachy: this strength can be shown in other ways|pg||
nt|fabsayc: losing trick count should be applied only AFTER  a fit found|pg||
nt|peachy: agree on distributional openers, sure!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: NS may reach 5@D here too as in OR but may not be X.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and not doubled will bring it home for Neth |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4 imps in a close math:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: match.|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho: 7+4 u mean... :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: with the bid and raise, of @S's S is pretty sure N has at most 1 sp |pg||
nt|riccho: But denmark tries to lose them|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sunsamvar: and in my book equal ti a 16 point 5422|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: I mean 18+4=22|pg||
nt|sybarra: good reason not to touch  trump here|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 16point 5422 is pretty much a minimum hand:)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but Martin the chnces for  fit with a 2 suiter is doubled :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: join the 6h crowd, i think despite no top losers this is a poor slam|pg||
nt|riccho: I cannot understand 4@c here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not DK's day against Germany, losing at ice hockey, losing at bridge|pg||
nt|jcwla: "I didn't come to defend 3@D.  Well I didn't come to defend 4@C."|pg||
nt|riccho: Impossible to be a good contract|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sunsamvar: i wd be in 6@H too after opening 1@H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: opeing distributional gets u in trouble if P doubles ...SURE .... but land u in good games |pg||
