nt|vugraphzje: yes ill do my best|pg||
nt|flash: we've seen N-S before:  extremely aggressive style|pg||
nt|jcmax: Tks Catalina! :)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|flash: 2@C (obviously) artificial|pg||
nt|jcmax: It might be some version of what the Italians call gazzilli|pg||
nt|reisig: seems ...not Gazilli|pg||
nt|reisig: or Gazzilli|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dburn: could be, but that's a pretty thin hand to treat as 16+|pg||
nt|flash: the hand-type doesn't seem to fit??   i'm wondering if 1NT wasn't conventional?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: N has a 6-card @H suit. Maybe on one hand he feels his pointcount is too high to just rebid 2@H and on the other hand he doesn't like his suit quality either|pg||
nt|flash: 2@S is the 'impossible' raise - showing a good hand for @Cs|pg||
nt|reisig: 2@s is clearly a big @c fit|pg||
nt|mikeyb:  playing standard I would bid 2 diamonds, anyone bidding 2H  yuk|pg||
nt|dburn: a suggestion from a knowledgeable spectator|pg||
nt|flash: (South can't have real @Ss, else he'd've responded 1@S initially)|pg||
nt|dburn: that 2@c is wek with hearts or some strong hand|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jcmax: if 2@C was artificial, 2@S might well be both minors I imagine|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: and 2@h instead would show hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|flash: there are strict penalties for discussing results inside the playing area|pg||
nt|mikeyb:  looks like 5 d might fetch, but 3nt is very iffy|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|reisig: I like Pass :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|flash: however, there's a tradition of adjouring to the hallway/lobby/smoking area to share tales of woe|pg||
nt|dburn: this looks a reasonable spot - whatever the auction meant, it was a good one|pg||
nt|flash: we've heard that De Knijff - Wrang are not having a good set|pg||
nt|flash: which would bring things down to our two leading pairs or a dark horse emerging from well back in the pack|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mikeyb:  yes, it may take a trump lead to beat 5|pg||
nt|jcmax: HH at the other table played in 2@H and made an overtrick|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d3|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|flash: so 140  vs 130...   no swing|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|dK|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|reisig: Flash ....put on more exciting hands - pls|pg||
mc|10|pg||
qx|o26|st||md|4SK9842HADAJ7CJT76,SAJ76HKT6D4CK9853,SQT3H5DKT98652CAQ,S5HQJ987432DQ3C42|sv|b|nt|jcmax: it really depends on whether many tables bid to game and whether they make it or not. HH are sitting the opposite direction of LW|pg||
nt|dburn: this one has some potential|pg||
mb|3H|nt|flash: yes - the datum is set across the field|pg||
mb|d|mb|4H|nt|dburn: Helness and Helgemo, if report is correct, were down one in six diamonds|pg||
nt|reisig: 6@d feels right|pg||
nt|reisig: BUT ..is bad|pg||
nt|dburn: when the opponents meanly led spades to the first and second tricks|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|dburn: and East evn more unsportingly remembered which suit was trump|pg||
nt|reisig: I agree w 6@d bid|pg||
nt|jcmax: Same auction as at the other table|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|reisig: Better lead a 5 :)|pg||
nt|mikeyb:   could be a popular spot|pg||
nt|jcmax: Now it all depends on the lead...|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|d3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|reisig: we have ONE more hand?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
mc|11|nt|mikeyb:  Benitos rule, always lead your stiff|pg||
nt|flash: last hand coming up...|pg||
nt|dburn: we do now|pg||
nt|jcmax: Amazing that even this event is coming to an end. i agree, Richie :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzje: They r making each pair check the scores of this session before they leave the room|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: so theres no mistakes before giving results|pg||
nt|flash: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|flash: we'll stay open until we get at least preliminary results|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a grand slam for North-West, but no one else can make very much|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: they printed out the results of each pair so they can take a view|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|mikeyb:  no preemption from Levin|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikeyb:  Those who play 1d=4+ have edge|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he cannot raise diamonds all that hight - his partner might not have all that many|pg||
nt|reisig: I'd never raise MY 1@h overcall w that|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mikeyb:  Levin will bid 3d, i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikeyb:  he is afraid cohen is watching|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, his partner might have five diamonds, so as to avoid the full weight of the Law from descending|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dburn: as it is, he only has four, but he has a lot of other things as well|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|vugraphzje: no standings yet, players checking their scores|pg||
nt|reisig: It's been fun|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|dburn: trouble is, he has just about enough entries to get the diamonds wrong, so he hasn't made this yet|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|flash: thnx again to Catalina Robles for a great job and to our crew of commentators|pg||
nt|dburn: but that was a good way not to get the diamonds wrong, and he ought to be OK now|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
nt|flash: pls check your book-marked BBO Vugraph Schdule web page for upcoming events and local times|pg||

mc|10|nt|vugraphzje: ok ill go and get results|pg||
nt|reisig: bye all|pg||
nt|flash: feels very close - any guesses?|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: No standings yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: Director will bring me a copy as soon as he comes with them|pg||
nt|flash: any pair not in the top 3 overnight would have to overcome a margin of at least 1200 cross-IMPs|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: i heard is close|pg||
nt|po-s: between the three?|pg||
nt|flash: we've heard that De Knijff - Wrang were not having a good set|pg||
nt|flash: which would leave our 2 featured pairs|pg||
nt|flash: it feels as though Levin-Weinstein have had the better of it, but the margin was 330 cross-IMPs|pg||
