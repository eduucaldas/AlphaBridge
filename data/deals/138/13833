mb|p|mb|1S!|an|4th suit forcing|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|petergill: Session 4 scores can be shown, because there are big sessional prizes in Session 5, so that pairs out of contention have something to aim for. |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjf: as advertised|pg||
nt|dburn:  may be as well - this is easier after 1@c-1@d than after 1@c-1@s or anything else|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: though this wont be much of a challenge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can spy on the other table using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   but Ekeblad-Jansma auctions based on Ekeblad's Ultimate Canape system|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S 4th suit forcing|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dburn:  still not so easy, though - those intermediate cards mean that 6@c is a pretty good slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: excellent slam. 75% at least|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: this auction is extremely unimpressive|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Hamman apologises to partner|pg||
nt|petergill: Despite Hamman's rule about playing in 3NT .... |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: killing the beer card|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: spec asks question that i can't answer   is 1@C-2@D strong jump shift|pg||

nt|petergill: Hamman's Rule "When three notrump is one of the alternatives, choose it." would want very unfriendly breaks in clubs and elsewhere on this hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: I mean the previous hand|pg||
nt|ritong: closer to 4NT as an alternative|pg||
mb|3D|nt|petergill: Dbl all pass?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: expecting 3@d dbled to be the contract|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Sotuh could run to 3@S?|pg||
mb|p|an|woolsey shrugs|nt|petergill: Should he? Will he?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dburn:  he could, but why on Earth should he?|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|petergill: A partner of mine named John Roberts once opened 3@C, Dbl, P P Rdbl by him with 3316, we scored up plus 530 in 3@HX instead of minus 1100. |pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: notice how choice of convention prevented Hamman from opening 2@D :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hamman response to carding   -  never use the stuff ??|pg||

nt|petergill: A different John Roberts from the late John Roberts who (with 2 friends) started up this version of the Cavendish in Las Vegas in 1997 and had earlier set up (with his friends) a ...|pg||
nt|petergill: music festival named Woodstock. The Cavendish Teams is named after that John Roberts. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Compton might have been better served shifting to the Q @s at trick 2|pg||

nt|vugraphzjf: Compton asks how many @ds Hamman had|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  some|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Any time anyone waves me to speed up, no matter who the waver is, I slow down. Most slow players behave exactly the same.  With good reason. |pg||
mb|1S|mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: strongest Michaels I've seen in a while|pg||
nt|petergill: So often, I find the waver has misanalysed. Of course, that probably does not apply to Bob Hamman. |pg||
nt|dburn:  do not try this with your local traffic cop|pg||
mb|4C!|an|fit showing|nt|ahollan1: here's an interesting twist i didn't see coming|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C presumably Fit Showing   |pg||

nt|ritong: but hey, he has a grand total of nine black cards|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|cavendish: score corrections are finally completed from the last session, so results are now posted on the website|pg||
nt|dburn:  now, is Chip supposed to double this?|pg||
nt|petergill: Delaying the play of @CK might have saved a trick on the previous hand, as the cards lie. |pg||
nt|dburn:  and what is Woolsey supposed to do?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Pass, 4N scramble, 5@D guess   you pick|pg||
nt|ritong: spped up|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Woolsey complaining about something . Director here|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Woolsey leaves to talk privately|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: director now talking to Compton about the 4@c bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: I guess Compton unsure of the meaning though I thought he wrote fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: obviously big difference between fit and splinter|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: they are talking outside the curtains but Woolsey is agitated and talking loudly defeating the purpose|pg||
nt|petergill: I think he will bid 4NT t and |pg||
nt|petergill: bid and make game|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Compton now complains about it stating there is unauthorised info now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on board 17, Grue opened Woolsey hand 1@D [Precision]  now Jansma [west] in 8@C|pg||
nt|dburn:  South has what looks like a pass, but all this agitation...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: pass if its fit showing for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: but if its  a splinter not clear|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Woolsey back now and Not at all happy|pg||
