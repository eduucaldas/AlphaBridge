nt|yuval10: S considering Pass or 3NT i believe|pg||
nt|ludewig: 3 down doubled is not bad either|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|caitlin: 2@H is weaker bid whereas 2@S would show more values by West in case East has hearts|pg||

nt|caitlin: with those hearts?|pg||
nt|yuval10: same bidding in the CR but N decided to bid 3@s|pg||
nt|ludewig: depending on what Souths double means|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: alerted as showing @hs or any strong hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: instead of X|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's takeout in the sense that they can't both have hearts when East has at least 6|pg||
nt|caitlin: other room N-S made 3N|pg||
nt|yuval10: the Israeli team playing in this event is the team who will represent Israel in the European Championship in Ostende, Belgium next month|pg||
nt|ludewig: it is usually a good idea to force the opener to show his long suit and X is the best way|pg||
nt|yuval10: consist of the 2 pairs playing and Ginossar-Pachtman|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: a kib asked me: what do u think about that multi? |pg||
nt|caitlin: more points in diamonds than hearts:)|pg||
nt|ludewig: OK for me, AK is a lot but 6 cards and NV you can't pass|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1st hand white vs red.... i think the majority of the players will open it|pg||
nt|caitlin: same multi at other table.....typical multi|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Perfectly normal at these colours|pg||
nt|caitlin: so Roland what would you expect for a vulnerable multi?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A better suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he is NV|pg||
nt|ludewig: West is still considering running this to his hand|pg||
nt|ludewig: after Souths Diamond Jack earlier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you keep waiting for the ideal hand, you may have to wait until the end of time|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|po-s: small is really bad but king, then heart to ace, diamond,diamond is also quite costly|pg||

nt|petergill: By passing, South is saying to his RHO - you are wrong and I will put all my eggs in one basket of 1@DX.  Rdbl is more flexible - lots of other contracts might be better.  |pg||
nt|kastan88: 1@D= 11..14 bal or 11..16 w/o 5M, even may be 6@C+4M and diamond void, not now after 1@D opener passed over double, must be some bal hand|pg||

nt|petergill: North's offshape Dbl is not perfect shape but seems sensible. An alternative is to overcall 1@S = good for lead-directing.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 3NT by West is fine ...|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kastan88: estonian pair plays strong 1@C=16+, 1NT=15...17, nebulous 1@D= 11...14 bal or 11...16 w/o 5+M|pg||
nt|petergill: East's hand is rather strong for his bidding - he might have invited with 3@D over 2@D, over which West bids 3NT. |pg||

nt|petergill: Also, the NT's are right-sided with all the strength likely to be in the Doubler's hand, and the @D's are wrongsided - that also argues for a move towards 3NT.|pg||

nt|vugraphzkm: knew u will like this match, Yuval :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'd bid 2@h from S, if i have some ways to show a "better" raise, like 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  i vote for dbl with N hand|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|caitlin: I like the 2@D transfer bid showing a weak 2@H for South|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: Yuval we would play it opposite way:)|pg||
nt|ludewig: 5@C is actually a good contract, requires Diamond finesse against opener|pg||
nt|yuval10: hello Bernard|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I would bid 1nt with short but fat majors like AQ and KJx|pg||

nt|yuval10: what would you bid from W?|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|ludewig: I guess 2@H followed by 3@C over 2S should show the hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC_2010/10_05_12_dma.html  for live scoring and standings|pg||
nt|petergill: A good thing for a partnership to discuss and know in advance = which is weaker by East - Pass of 3@D, or 3@H over 3@D? |pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kastan88: 3h depends how to handle hearts, probably after double its easier to count A for South|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: My own partnership plays 3@H as weaker and Pass as forcing ... some top American pairs play Pass as weaker and 3@H as more encouraging. |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|kastan88: but aggressive North not giving to play that part score for opps, and he is right|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: North has not gone overboard, allowing for his partner to have made an aggressive Dbl. when he bid 3@D, he planned to bid 3@S over the inevitable 3@H. Inevitable unless you play ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Pass of 3@D as non forcing.  |pg||

nt|riccho: I would dbl 2@h here (as they did in the open room)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@D first time round would have consumed more spade and EW would likely never bid again|pg||
