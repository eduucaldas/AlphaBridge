mb|p|mb|1N|nt|vugraphzjf: Levin telling Piekarek doing "very" no good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17(18)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|2D|mb|p!|nt|vugraphzjf: Piekarek doing some splaining to Levin|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS probably denies @D stop   so immediate 2@S would show -- but just guessing|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjf: Smirnov would like to bid spades forcing|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: if Smirnov RDBL -- probably re-stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjf: and here comes music to his ears|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: good guessing  but DBL instead of RDBL|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't think this can survive the 4-1 trump break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: similar agreements available when 4th hand DBL 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Unfortunately VG operators are denied  the assistance of GIB|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As Weinstein can't give a heart trick away, this should go 1 down|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Next Session 16:00 PDT 17:00EDT 00:00 UK 01:00 Europe and 09:00+1 Sydney|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Billy Miller wrote recent article in ACBL Bulletin about 1N-(2@C)-? |pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: 75 minutes from now|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|vugraphzjf: Levin may be interested in @DK suggesting heart here|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: sorry, article about 1N-P-2@C-DBL|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Normal contract with 9 tricks at almost all tables I predict|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: 3NT by E without N/S bidding something like 1NT 3NT would make probably|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is Vegas Roland -- you've got to give odds    but nobody betting against your prediction anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: There are  many theories about whether stayman etc gives away too much info|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: Demirev found the same excellent lead in our other room|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 6@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What about the two cashing aces?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Sorry missed club in north hand - but my normal slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Club in south I meant of course - I can usually see five card suit|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: in other room Demirev has a gadget   2N rebid over 1@H|pg||
nt|po-s: even worse than a Roland slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: I have reached the unfortunate stage of life where I need two pairs of glasses one for short and one for distance - doesnt work well with BBO operating table to computer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fragment rather than a splinter, so 3@S implies club shortage|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: And yes to the kind person that asked I am tired - BBO operating is quite tiring especially when one commentates as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Or could be that 3@S shows any shortage|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|vugraphzjf: As Weinstein sspills all his bidding cards  onto the floor|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: He puts them back up as Levin flicks the tray back and they fall down again|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: 3@S was ANY splinter -- but Bobby Levin decided not to ask|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok -- splinter in @C or @S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Levin had a feeling|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: I just asked 3@S was non specific splinter|pg||
