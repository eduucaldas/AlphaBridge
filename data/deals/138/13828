mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn:  well, no difficulty in compromising on this deal at least|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|flash: i'm told the web cam might be worth a peek:    www.cavendishinvitational.com|pg||
nt|reisig: Come on David ...say something clever about this hand :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: 2@C a limit raise of some ilk (Drury)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|flash: at least it will be over quickly?|pg||
nt|dburn:  not much to say - debatable whether 3NT or 4@h is a superior contract, I guess|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|dburn:  I mean, if hearts were 4-0 3NT would be down but 4@h might still make|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|flash: quad queens perhaps not worth as much in this game as in another??|pg||
mb|3H|mb|d|nt|flash: West's X is responsive|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|flash: 12 tricks available with the trump position and the @D split?|pg||

pc|h5|nt|dburn:  normal to lead a heart, not a spade - not so easy from @hQxxx to play low as North, but you trust partner to lead high from @hAKxx|pg||

nt|dburn:  but important to call for the ten, as Justin Lall did - not that he really thought Chip Martel would play the queen if he had it, but...|pg||
