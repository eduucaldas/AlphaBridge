nt|ludewig: depending on what Souths double means|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: alerted as showing @hs or any strong hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: instead of X|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's takeout in the sense that they can't both have hearts when East has at least 6|pg||
nt|caitlin: other room N-S made 3N|pg||
nt|yuval10: the Israeli team playing in this event is the team who will represent Israel in the European Championship in Ostende, Belgium next month|pg||
nt|ludewig: it is usually a good idea to force the opener to show his long suit and X is the best way|pg||
nt|yuval10: consist of the 2 pairs playing and Ginossar-Pachtman|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: a kib asked me: what do u think about that multi? |pg||
nt|caitlin: more points in diamonds than hearts:)|pg||
nt|ludewig: OK for me, AK is a lot but 6 cards and NV you can't pass|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1st hand white vs red.... i think the majority of the players will open it|pg||
nt|caitlin: same multi at other table.....typical multi|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Perfectly normal at these colours|pg||
nt|caitlin: so Roland what would you expect for a vulnerable multi?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A better suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he is NV|pg||
nt|ludewig: West is still considering running this to his hand|pg||

nt|Walddk2: If you keep waiting for the ideal hand, you may have to wait until the end of time|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|h_karluk: *mixed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but that would be my last wish to play 3N after i employed cbs or nmf whatever with a stiff|pg||
nt|pelu: with @D8 7 - defense cant take 4 @D-tricks - so @c5 now|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mcarroll: No guarantee of a @H fit - or break, and game points - Hamman says if 3NT is an option - bid it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Who am I to disagree|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the problem is with closed cards i do not know how many tricks belongs to defenders, so i wld rather feel myself comfortable in @h contract. if you want to play NT then why asked ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h support and strength with your stiff?|pg||

nt|h_karluk: what a wide range, 6-12|pg||
mb|4D|nt|pelu: 6-12 is a wide range, I prefer 3@C = 10-12, and 3@D = 7-9|pg||
mb|4S|nt|h_karluk: 3D normal in my book, anyways not sure abt 4D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: agreed Peter, that was the way we played on OKB 97-2000|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|caitlin: I like the 2@D transfer bid showing a weak 2@H for South|pg||
pc|hK|nt|caitlin: Yuval we would play it opposite way:)|pg||

nt|h_karluk: that's why i wondered|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: say you hooked and failed, still @h loser there|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as kib suggested, if @c K is offside, there are 4 losers, but only 4|pg||
