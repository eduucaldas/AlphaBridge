nt|davidstern: And a little about the tournament as well|pg||
nt|davidstern: A low diamond makes life interesting|pg||
nt|reisig: Not amazing ...for down 1|pg||
nt|davidstern: Declarer can then make 4 diamonds and five clubs|pg||
nt|davidstern: I would suggest the lead will decide the result|pg||
nt|calabres: swiss teams 9 rounds, in 9th danish|pg||
nt|davidstern: A low diamond to Jack and King and diamond finesse for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: i dont expect a diamond lead, that is to say, I wouldn't pick it|pg||
nt|othered1: @H|pg||
nt|reisig: @d ..is insanity|pg||
nt|davidstern: So just so we are clear if West does lead a diamond you are calling him insance :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Round suit lead|pg||
nt|othered1: If @H, which one?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|reisig: Perfect!|pg||
nt|davidstern: If @HJ East needs to switch to a spadse|pg||

nt|ady: I would predict down 1|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Would u open at EDavid?|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|reisig: there's a danger ...of 6N|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: North may have been quite excited when partner opened 1NT and may need a shower not to get too high|pg||
nt|davidstern: Cold shower|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which may make  .... on a club lead|pg||
mb|4N|nt|davidstern: But always 11 when you hold the North Hand|pg||
nt|othered1: lead @C against power auction?|pg||
nt|reisig: Prob 4N here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: 10 tricks manageable, 11 hard|pg||

nt|calabres: Rui Pinto will neve lead a @C, nor with a shotgun on is neck:)|pg||
nt|davidstern: VG reports that this was a quantitative auction|pg||
nt|othered1: a little bit more body in the north hand and it would be really tough just to invite. |pg||
nt|davidstern: Luis you need to read page 14 para 3 section 2 on the use of never when commentating|pg||
nt|calabres: maybe|pg||
pc|d8|nt|davidstern: The original 1NT was 11-14|pg||
