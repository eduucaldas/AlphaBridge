nt|ralfwil: Good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: Fishpool the epitome of an expressive french woman a very experienced player good card player|pg||
nt|lestergold: liikes to double if she smells blood|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: The Levy team has opened a commanding lead|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all and welcome.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: She and her husband Steve were Young Chelsea members years ago  |pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Good morning|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzxs: hi|pg||
nt|lestergold: yesd it is sad that steve doesnt play bridge he is a very talented player|pg||
nt|sharkey: off shape t/o Dbl by Ms Clement|pg||
nt|lestergold: but it is right fopr her to double with those values and 4 good spaders|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Hi, Quentin.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good afternoon, everyone|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi, Liz.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|daman: looks like a normal 3NT fvor EW?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxs: hi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: looks like EW can make 4@S...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: An exciting board to start|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: W has a problem now - 3@C may have been better than x|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am quite impressed with the 1@H overcall - don;t think I would bid such a bad suit in the sandwich position|pg||
nt|sharkey: not sure - W needs IMPs so may blast into a few @D....|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: not enuf to keep the Fish out o 4@h|pg||
nt|sharkey: may be 1@S is preferable to Dbl?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|daman: would 2NT show 16?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Liz. Hi to all.|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think 2@H is meant as forcing|pg||
pc|dT|nt|daman: invitational|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cuttysark: A fast auction to the normal spot: South rebids her spades to show at least 5, North denies support|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: negative diamond lead looks best|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: Good morning|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed - seems to attack communications and wait for tricks in the other suits|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning all |pg||
nt|ady: good morning David|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Spades lie quite well for declarer, who will probably look for tricks there|pg||
nt|cuttysark: (and good morning, Louis and Davids)|pg||
nt|daman: otherwise she could transfer|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Swift auction to the gran slam -|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks like 2 down, a small save against 400|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sharkey: View N has @SK) the spots are good enuff to pull trumps|pg||
nt|sharkey: @SK9|pg||
nt|jcwla: Looks like 4NT is the ask, 5@S shows two with the @CQ, 5NT shows the presence of all key cards, and 7@C is made with the side source of tricks.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: agree. A 1@S overcall is an attractive possibility, as that is the suit you would like partner to lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: seems only realistic play is QX spades with east|pg||
nt|xenya: where's the 9th trick|pg||
nt|daman: can make 9 tricks double dummy|pg||
nt|daman: a low @D now will give him 9 perhaps|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cuttysark: She is unlucky in her finesses|pg||
nt|jcwla: 15 tricks at notrump, but at IMPs the most important thing is to get to the grand.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed, if all the aces are present it is hard to imagaine a hand with no play for the Grand|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: diaond continuation seems best|pg||
pc|c3|nt|daman: on balance   it will be a struggle|pg||
nt|xenya: let's see -- N wins and switches to spades...|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|c7|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But 5@S may be more expensive if they find the heart ruffs, so she has done well|pg||
nt|lestergold: all actions have their dowmnsides with east's hand the important thing is that she must tale some action|pg||
pc|d9|nt|garnetts: this works quite well |pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|ady: best now to cash diamonds and king and another spade|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sharkey: natural @S trick...|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|cuttysark: Communication very difficult - it would be so much easier if her clubs were like dumy's spades|pg||
nt|garnetts: cashing diamonds and hearts priot to exiting with the last heart is as good as anything|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think I would prefer a takeout double|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: EW will be looking for action, certainly.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: all sees to lead to down 1|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sharkey: ruff @C @SQ and @D finesse...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Defence can always get 2@s 1@h and 2@d in my opinion|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello MIke!|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Raif|pg||
nt|daman: hey Mike|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sharkey: especially down 55 IMPs...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|garnetts: they do but what else can you do apart from stopping in a partscore |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Hello Mike. Can only add, that if they could have a method to show both majors in this position...|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Mike|pg||
pc|d5|mc|8|nt|cuttysark: Hoping for the doubleton queen - not much else to play for, as you said at the start|pg||

nt|sharkey: 1 NT by E - may be final contract?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe after minors it is not so clear - 2@D Michaels?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Anyway, she has reduced the lead by 3 imps|pg||
nt|daman: giving or receiving?|pg||
nt|daman: :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: can they get to 5@C?|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|garnetts: true but there was a more obvious end play |pg||
nt|ady: 4@S an excellent game for e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: giving them|pg||
nt|lestergold: they may think they are saving in 5@c|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sharkey: dont think NS will enter into the fray VUL|pg||
nt|xenya: repeated spade leads would have beaten 3N i think |pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - unlikely - I think - unless pushed|pg||
nt|lestergold: what does 2@s mean here?|pg||
nt|sharkey: must be a type transfer?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: @c transfert|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S? A psyche? Or showing clubs...|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: not enamoured with the 2@C overcall prefer 1NT |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looking at the NS hands, 4@H is pretty good - sinks on the 4-1 break|pg||
nt|ady: even with spade king offside can make if getting diamond position right|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@H is unlucky to fail |pg||
mb|2C|nt|sharkey: S thinks otherwise|pg||
nt|cuttysark: When I was commentating yeserday there were a lot of slams - here we go again|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The trick here is to avoid the 7-level|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Players are getting more and more aggressive entering against strong 1N openers|pg||
nt|daman: 2@H must be 5-4 majors and weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Now West needs to set up a game-forcing auction, set hearts as trump, and find out that partner has the right controls|pg||
nt|xenya: however it was made in the other room too -- so that wasn't too easy |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Must show clubs|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcwla: Nice 4@S bid here to help them avoid getting too high with W not holding any @S's.|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: well well !!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3@H is a Fit Jump - shows clubs as well as hearts|pg||
nt|sharkey: View S and E totally combine for 30 HCP+ S is lucky to catch this good a dummy|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Important to discuss the difference between 3@S and 4@S after a 2-level response|pg||
nt|lestergold: more likely the latter my prediction is 5@c doubled|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: In Acol she could make a strong jump shift to 2@S, then bid 4@H to showthis hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South raising to 3@D would make things awkward - now West can cue-bid 3@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very thin contract which we can see can be defeated double dummy|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H makes..|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh im wrong|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - @S lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: beats it|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: dim switch|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW a tad passive here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: west came in late    will be pleased with dummy|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cuttysark: When opponents have a double fit.... so do you|pg||
nt|daman: too bad dummy didn't have 10x of @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: the heart switch is very far from obvious here|pg||
nt|lestergold: ironically it can still be defeated providing Fishpool does not continue spades|pg||
nt|xenya: once again, 9th trick can't be readily found|pg||
pc|c2|nt|henryb:  I am not sure it is wise. On this hand South will make 110, but she would have made 100 on defense|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sharkey: surprised W didnt go on|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cuttysark: Asking about spades she will find that the queen is missing and avoid the Grand...|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|daman: this will be easy now   |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d9|nt|cuttysark: And, having bid all 5 denominations, she finally reveals her heart support at the 6-level!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: well, AK10x is adequate support|pg||
nt|lestergold: very expenive if this is let thru|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|garnetts: I acnnot believe that she played a club--will south be able to read it |pg||
nt|ady: down now with diamond played|pg||
nt|garnetts: South will think she has six spades maybe--|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Norths diamond lead must be a singleton |pg||
nt|cuttysark: (Easy for me to see, I guess, but why else lead dummy's suit?|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would take 3@S as setting trump and asking for control bidding.  A jump to game seems more of this type of hand: nothing but @S's but an opener rather than a preempt.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: at this stage of the match|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|garnetts: Oh dear|pg||
nt|xenya: NS have 5 tricks now -- can they get them?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well  very cheeky contract let thru because Fishpool was frightened of giving more awayby switchimg|pg||
pc|h5|nt|daman: the @D K was ill advised|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: cud be double score...|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i think Fish is a trick short one way or the other|pg||
nt|sharkey: problem now - cant pull trumps|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: W has shown 10 cards in @C & @H|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: the ten o spades will come into its own|pg||
nt|lestergold: or is this squeeze?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: only chance singleton @DJ or 10 in West|pg||
pc|s8|nt|xenya: well done|pg||
nt|lestergold: rast discarding in front|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: well they did after al.l played catch up|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: jdims and it was made|pg||
nt|lestergold: west failed to count her tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: or failed to count the opponents tricks |pg||
nt|mdgraham: or...wait a mo...East has to discard.... |pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||
nt|garnetts: no choice but to lead a @D if you think about it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Normal contract, normal result.|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: je m'etonne que S n'a pas dit 1SA|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|iain sime: Miad Grant and Sheila Macdonald are EW in the open room. Sam doesn't do mornings (if she is given the choice). Hence why I am guessing Sheila Adamson and Ane Symons are NS.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|iain sime: Sorry Maida and Anne mis-typed.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The clue is in the NT range - A/S are the only strong NT pair, Sheila Adamson usually sits North|pg||
nt|bg: Hi all!  1 NT seems like a good spot  N has a tough lead to make|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Slightly surprising that South did not open - she is just back from her honeymoon and might bein optimisitic mood|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|iain sime: West would have done better to rise ace. But 3NT could have made anyway- win the third club and rely upon the spade king.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: 6 IMP ca coute assez cher, surtout pour l'equipe qui a besoin des points|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cuttysark: Just the plan Sheila is adopting|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|iain sime: Winning the first club would have worked when West ducked. |pg||

nt|cuttysark: If you put your mouse over the Closed Room contract you see their auction|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W could have set up more pressure on NS by taking the 6 @c tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, that makes things difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: had east discarded a spade it may have been harder for the Fish|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Well, Reess team need IMPs so have to do something.  So far this worked out|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Flat board. Auction at the other table did not really address the spade issue, it seems.   |pg||
nt|cuttysark: QUite similar  but over 1NT West could bis a forcing 3@H|pg||
mb|1D|nt|daman: hard to beat 3NT here|pg||
nt|lestergold: ditch 2 spades and keep club q she was down|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: however 4@h may well be the contract|pg||
nt|daman: 4@H by East would be a struggle|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: Misfits coing up...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Rebid 2@H or 2@S here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: right u are Carl|pg||
nt|sharkey: not the start Reess team were looking for|pg||
mb|2C|nt|cuttysark: Another brave bid, from South this time|pg||
nt|daman: same auction in the CR|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@H makes I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 5th highest lead clarifies the count in diamonds for everyone|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I prefer 2@H because that may be where we want to play - I would need better spades for 2@S|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, the @S's look like five, don't they?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 5@c4|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: some might have competed with 2@S with east hand   vulnerability may have beeb influential|pg||
nt|daman: they led the @S Queen in the CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  yes, S can hope to find at least 1 fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I wonder what that double means - if penalty it is a big view|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: EW can make 5@D I think; have to work on @S suit - not @H.  3 NT easier....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi all|pg||
nt|henryb:  E-W can make game, but only game in either red suit. I agree with Canonne that West is worth a reverse, but it may be hard to keep Clement from overreaching to slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Hamdi|pg||
nt|sharkey: W forced to bid 3 NT now?|pg||
nt|xenya: re previous hand: 3N cant be made even if declarer puts in the @DJ -- suppose she runs the clubs and plays the @HK -- N wins and cashes the @SQ squuezzing declarer out of the 9th ...|pg||
nt|xenya: trick |pg||
nt|lestergold: yes an interesting position i didnt see it |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|garnetts: a bit of a coffee hand now---maybe a lot of players would double 2@H with the East hand--I would have risked 2@S |pg||
nt|cuttysark: A low club lead and a couple of heart ruffs would have been an exciting defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear as so often happens towards wbs if nattchwa wyrgbug deficits|pg||

nt|lestergold: oh dear my typing eight of the rails|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|sharkey: After West's reverse 3@S must be forcing....|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - East's 3@S|pg||

nt|bridge_one: for kibitz that arn't from ireland and EBU i have take informations about the system played by Gross Brock|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|cuttysark: This 2@D is weka with both majors|pg||

mb|p|nt|iain sime: NS play 15/17, five card majors and weak twos in the majors. Their 2D! opener is weak with at least 5/4 in the majors.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bridge_one: overall in MP competitions|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: This hand is everyones 4@H contract--a spread too|pg||

nt|henryb:  At the other table East chpse to lead a club against 4@h and one of the spade losers was quickly thrown away|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||

nt|daman: time*|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cuttysark: Looks like an accurate stop - provided the defenders cash their clubs there are 5 losers|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: defenders will need to cash their 2 diamond tricks when in with A@H  or there will be an overtrick|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cuttysark: Or not :)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d7|nt|h_karluk: Say you stop in 3@h and your opps find killing @s lead, then you proud of yourself and smile about nice stop. However, once you reached the fat that impossible 4 made then you ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: think that's not fair. Sometimes good bidding punished while bad bidding rewarded|pg||
nt|jcwla: I like the 3@S -- knows they have a safe home in @D's and E may (and did) really want to hear about the @S card there.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: probably nine tricks here - NS unlikely toi switch to clubs when they win the @SA|pg||

nt|jcwla: dividends.|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Queen lead askig for a reverse attitude signal - South will discourage perforce since sh has no small cards|pg||

nt|henryb:  At the other table East chose to open 1@d. What would you do as South?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@c is fine if 51H can be made but it cant|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: 4@h transfer to 4@S|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another slam where you need to find the queen of trump - hard to reach from here|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: 3@C?  |pg||
nt|ady: if east competes n/s will surely go to 3@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: E opened CR - you can see the bidding in CR by letting the mouse pointer pass over the Closed Room contract|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, time to show the diamond support :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: No 3@C opener - surprising, it looks a reasonable pre-empt. Perhaps East views it as too strong|pg||
mb|2C|nt|garnetts: bnot mad keen on double with xx in @D |pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|cuttysark: best to support partner at the 6-level when there is a slam on|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Not sure about 5@S - after the 3@s raise, time to pass perhaps |pg||
nt|daman: a sensible auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Think N shud have bid 3@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@d was also off on a heart ruff|pg||
mb|5D|nt|sharkey: Bet S likes this :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: double risks 3@D|pg||
nt|ady: I believe 2NT in this position shows 2 places to play|pg||
nt|ady: good bid by west|pg||
nt|ady: this comes home with diamond finesse right|pg||
nt|jcwla: I wonder whether 3@H is invitational or forcing.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The jump to 3@H is unusual nowadays - many play 2@H as forcing and 3@H as a splinter|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East now has a problem that she didn't want|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Indeed - when partner doubles at her second shot there is a reason why she did not double first time - hand is flawed|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  If she guesses right to go up and continue the suit she will have good defensive chances|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cuttysark: "The 5-level belongs to the opposition" - or was that "When in doubt, bid one more?"|pg||

nt|lestergold: im sure what u see is correct|pg||

nt|lestergold: east had a clearcut no trump raise|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: would we double 1 @S with the East hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: sure Carl|pg||

mb|1C|nt|jcwla: What E does over 1@H-1@S-2@C will tell the tale of this hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: seems everything is on the right spot there|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: if she had 3 clubs when a low one was led ducking was right --cannot remember if she had 2 or 3 |pg||
nt|daman: the silence is deafening|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If it´s my only chance to act - yes|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: one of those exciting things - if West had opened 1@D, NS would not have bid to 3NT |pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5@C is beaten y leading 3 rounds of diamonds, and so promoting a trump trick.|pg||
nt|lestergold: coffe hand 3n has to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: if partner has A@C then fine if not then she has the K@D |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: You can look it up - go to Movie and click on the result|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in 5@c, W leads @d triple and promotes @c Q |pg||
nt|lestergold: doesnt matter 6@c aslo makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 i meant|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@c not 6 0fm course|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: i see nothing wrong with the double|pg||
nt|lestergold: with 4@h and an opening bid however min i would double the opening bid for sure|pg||
nt|daman: EW can make at least 3 H and probably more|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Looks a normal 2@H - she has enough to keep the bidding open in case partner is quite strong|pg||
pc|c2|nt|h_karluk: over D 2H F/NF , that's the question |pg||
nt|henryb:  I too would bid 2@c, but E-W had an ENORMOUS number coming on defense|pg||
nt|jcwla: W's 2@S rebid should show this type of hand and these extras.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cuttysark: Tough problem for West now|pg||
nt|cuttysark: One of my 'things' is that if you want to open light in 3rd seat you should have a good suit, one you want partner to lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: very sensible|pg||
nt|xenya: not ideal with AJ of spades but reasonable|pg||
nt|lestergold: are they gonna go overboard missing two bullets |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sharkey: I play it NF - Forcing on 1 level only|pg||

nt|daman: as Barry Crane said     "get in and get out"|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|daman: more a MP startegy though|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h not a greqat contract happens to be two finesses right but e/w should be in ths auction|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ady: seems like 3NT some sort of relay?|pg||
nt|garnetts: she had 3 so ducking was best --Thanks Liz|pg||
nt|jcwla: W has an awfully good hand even in context but gives partner some leeway and another really nice auction by E/W.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I guess 5@C is not too bad a contract, but the singleton ace would be better if it were the ace of hearts|pg||
nt|sharkey: dont go for coffee, Mike....|pg||
nt|lestergold: backwood seems to have been invoked just in timw|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I hope that is not read as three|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cuttysark: East-West have realised that they have two club losers, and stopped safely in game|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|cuttysark: Could 3NT be the dreaded Serious Slam Try?|pg||
nt|sharkey: many play 2@H after 1@S - Dbl - 2@H shows good @S raise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so that might help to avoid minor suit competition|pg||
nt|lestergold: if it does you can send the fat lady in|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sorry, can't be three. Brain failure|pg||
nt|lestergold: coffee much needed thk the lord|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|h6|nt|lestergold: may have pushed n/sto the unmakeable 4@s|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|henryb:  I think the modern approach is to play forcing at the one level and transfers at the two level. This sacrifices the natural 2@c response but gaains lead directing raises and the distinction between constructive and weak raises of opener's suit|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: free rides dont win matches|pg||
nt|daman: many matches are won/lost on competitive partscore hands|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer to act as early as possible and am also not so fond of balancing|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|sharkey: West elected to bid 2@C after pd's Rdbl,  Normally bidding after pd's Rdbl shows a weak opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: someone gonr to bed with dim ace?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|sfoxa:  3@c should be "color+fit" bid - gooad approach to reach game on limited values |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: not sure if EW play 30/41 or 14/30 - so it could be 0 or 3, I guess|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: I know, operator|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: You need to insert scores on boards 1-4 manually after you should down|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Only then will we see comparisons|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 2NT presumably a 3-card limit raise|pg||
nt|iain sime: 2NT will be an invitational three card raise. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1NT classic 15/17|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: interesting hand|pg||

pc|c6|nt|sybarra: e/w can take first 9 tricks but not easy to sort out |pg||
pc|s9|nt|cuttysark: Best to lead a shrt suit when you have so many trump - you want to ruff to aovid being emdplayed|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  yes, margin is very narrow - each trick matters|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Reese gained 6imps on board 8 by playing in 3@H 2 down|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: south likely to pre-emp after east opens|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sorry - Reess, not the late great JTR|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3@S seems enough|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree with them to some extent but still think 1@S was better on this hand with such good spades |pg||
mb|1N|nt|sharkey: 3 NT - coffee hand.....|pg||
nt|xenya: 7-5 -- what do you do with the S hand?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|daman: can you imagine   in the CR    West doubled 4@S    she must have thought it was Christmas    |pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: West would prefer a re-opening double here - but generally unwise with a void in their suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@s not quite on!|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Many I know would bid 4@S, despite the vulnerability - here it does not matter since partner is going to raise|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@s perhaps. no preempt in this position|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it should have been t least easter for one off|pg||
nt|xenya: so far identical to the CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: easy enough for north to raise to game   3@S Vul should be a dececent suit|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: as soon as north shows some values i think south will go for game|pg||
nt|xenya: both S's being sneaky|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: in fact even quicker than in cloased|pg||

pc|c3|nt|cuttysark: 3card support, 3Quick Tricks - what more coul one desire?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well should lose 2 spades 2 dims in theory|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|cuttysark: Followed by 3@S to show the 6card suit|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|cuttysark: Playing 5card majors South had alrady shown 5, so 2@H would promise a 6th heart|pg||
nt|iain sime: Yes. South's raise to game in a sequence which invited cue bidding persuaded North that 4S was enough.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|bg: now 2 clubs by non passed hand obviously not GF|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bridge_one: this hand is interesting bec 2@C is old natural style (no GF, like 2/1)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|dT|pc|c3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Yes Bruce :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but with passed hand you are sure about the UP limit|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Lead in the match seesawing back and forth - could hardly be closer|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry -- pickup for Levy|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: I think both categories play same hands, for serious players good chance to compare |pg||
nt|sharkey: The final segment starts at 1700 hours Paris time today|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no opportunioty here for Levy sadly|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score time    hearts for n/s|pg||
nt|sharkey: Both men and ladies?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I cannot see any possibility to make  4@s|pg||
nt|daman: would we double or overcall with the North hand?|pg||
nt|xenya: overcall|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as I play - yes!|pg||
nt|daman: same here|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: And another slam - 3 already in this set|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another 5imp swing on Board 7 when NS ploughed on to 4@S|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: ditto|pg||
nt|ralfwil: D for me|pg||
nt|daman: my Mother would double|pg||
nt|lestergold: u overcll first with this shape and later you probably make takeout double|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: West's Michael bid in principle shud show 5-5 in Majors|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The hand is strong enough to D and after that @h|pg||
nt|xenya: i can double later if needed|pg||
nt|daman: I disagree Ralf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a style of bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is a standard hand as recommended by Robert Owen in doubles for takeout penalties and profits|pg||
mb|p|pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: For me is a second double weaker thah this hand|pg||
nt|daman: if I double and bid a suit     I would have a stronger hand|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|ady: south should transfer  and pass at 2@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and BBO has a great service to compare. Here it is : http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph_archives/vugraph_archives.php?command=all|pg||
nt|jcwla: Do you prefer 3@S or 4@H?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think 4@H does not get the hand over, but am not keen on the splinter with the singleton king|pg||
nt|cuttysark: SO don't really like either, but you have to pick one!|pg||
nt|lestergold: what!?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|lestergold: Has Catherine taken leave orf her senses|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|h_karluk: another great service is : http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   you can watch all rooms in same time|pg||
nt|jcwla: Bergen advocates splintering even with stiff A or K - many disagree.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North now committed to slam, hoping there are not 2 spade losers|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, N might have investigated with 5@D, but would have had a lot of company with 4NT and the no-2-losers wish has been granted.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anyone for a 2@H rebid rather than 2@d?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It depends on what you expect for 4@C |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: North has @SKxx and a club filler|pg||
nt|lestergold: at tbhese colours and at this stage of the match she should quietly defend 4@h not likely to gain much sacking here|pg||
nt|sharkey: this turns out to be a great bid I think|pg||
nt|lestergold: could be more of a disaster than it is|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: declarer needs to take care   if hearts are 4-1   might get tapped out with club lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like this may be off 2 |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I vote for 2@h |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Question of style - but the suit strength would persuade me towards 2@H|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|ralfwil: for me strong enough and why not 1@s from S over 1@d?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cuttysark: Again, she is establishing diamonds before drawing trump - cannot afford to lose control of the trump suit when they can force dummy to ruff clubs|pg||
nt|sharkey: off 1 now |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cuttysark: Maybe we should unblock @HK before ducking the diamond|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sharkey: W wud have to shift to low @D 2nd trick for a @S thru - later S wud finesse for @D Q.....|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cuttysark: And we might discard @CK instead of ruffing the spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS are having a good set so far. North knows they can't have lost much, if any (in fact they have several sizeable gains)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sharkey: for down 2|pg||
nt|sharkey: can still get it if finesse|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|sharkey: S had the opportunity to ditch a @S on @CK when in dummy|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as for me, if "normal" 1NT is limited to 11 points, I wouldn't hope for game and look for better partscore|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But all wil be well|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so 2@h looks better, but it's definitely matter of style|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Reess team gaining a number of small swings |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Agreed - it does not look like a game hand, and no point in stretching nonvulnerable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6, 5, 6 on 6 thru 8|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|s9|nt|xenya: 4@S can be made here it seems -- not sure about 4@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: shud have pulled 2 x @S|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: i like to have more than a K with the flattish hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: but then still a guess|pg||
nt|sharkey: probably wud have been tapped in @S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: abt stiff A or Q D|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|cuttysark: Not the time to finesse hearts - better to continue diamonds|pg||
nt|sharkey: cud have been |pg||

mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Not sure whether the other table started with 11 & 12 - matches cut to 24 boards because the Irish had to come by ferry - or are just rather slow|pg||

nt|iain sime: Scotland won 12 on hand 4 instead of 11 per the scorecard, and were 11-0 up after two hands.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|sharkey: NS likely to get to 4@H - EW can sac in 5@D|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: i do|pg||

pc|c7|nt|sharkey: West missed her chance to bid @D|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Another example of the 'do you open NT with a 5card major?' question|pg||
pc|c3|nt|garnetts: brave overcall in the sandwich position |pg||
nt|h_karluk: counting nine on C suit twice finesse - no reason|pg||

pc|cK|nt|cuttysark: Well. you got close|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sharkey: S cud also be 6-5 - if @C10 instead of x wud be off 1|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: e/w likely to get too high|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Looks as if West will just ahve to pass and hope for the best|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, sorry, they are in 4@S - thought it was 3NT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Those playing 5card Stayman would reach 4@S even after opening 2NT|pg||
pc|h8|nt|h_karluk: that helps to pitch any loser of doubletons, so one gets 12 tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ralfwil: with open cards you can mahe 6@d!|pg||
nt|daman: they are in 6@D doubled in the CR|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: last chance of a plus for e/w was to pass 3@HX    not easy|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cuttysark: To me it seems that if East had enough for game opposite this hand she would have reopened eith 3@H rather than double - but it is a question of partneship style|pg||
nt|ady: west has run    and is right  3NT  expensive    4 clubs down 1|pg||
nt|garnetts: that will not get doubled |pg||
nt|garnetts: would have better off letting them be in 3NT |pg||
nt|cuttysark: She had 7 tricks in 3NT, so only 2 down :)|pg||
nt|ady: 3 hearts should be down 1    but very difficult to pass the double for west|pg||
nt|sharkey: easy game Hamid :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: NS have 27 HCP one would buy 3N but who|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
nt|garnetts: maybe that is why it is better to pass than to open with that hand |pg||
nt|lestergold: saving at equal vul you need to be confident that your side can make a lot of tricks- the hand was very dabgerous|pg||
nt|sharkey: Double score to Levy team I think - a little too late|pg||
nt|lestergold: ur asset was a 4333 hand with a king an umpteen loswr hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: under the circumstances - being up a bundle - I agree Mike|pg||

pc|s3|nt|garnetts: KQ stiif not that good and the clubs are just so so |pg||
nt|sharkey: Perhaps East shud have raised @D?|pg||
nt|jcwla: I think many would feel this too strong for 2@S in third white on red.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cuttysark: I think I would have bid 3@C rather than 2@S to indicate that I had opened with 6 clubs and a poor hand|pg||

nt|sybarra: and thx to our specs,  great comments !  I enjoy the humor |pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl with 4@H is obvious|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S would be a invenction|pg||
nt|sybarra: or "other suits"  |pg||
mb|r|mb|2H|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iain sime: Another ten imps to Scotland. Wales had nine top tricks in 3NT in the other room, but decided to play for overtricks on the premise that our ladies could not possibly find a heart ...|pg||
nt|iain sime: switch!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@C means weak hand long @C - no forcing|pg||
nt|bridge_one: different from 2/1|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|sybarra: some play the rebid of suit,  not forcing also  |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|bridge_one: direct count (H-L = even)|pg||
nt|bg: s/b down 1 with dia switch maybe 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: the restart time of this match in 16.05|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wilkinsona: this can go off..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...on a black suit switch...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Spade looks best|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|sybarra: about a 15 min break after it finishes then |pg||
pc|d9|nt|iain sime: Makes now.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...but friendly continuation is ok for declarer it seems..|pg||
nt|sybarra: or shorter if we take longer on this hand |pg||
nt|bridge_one: declarer can lose 2@s 1@D 1@H 1@C|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|bg: win dia ace lead spade Q N in a spot then|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: That is what my line would be, although if North then has the A@H, then you're in trouble for entries.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|s7|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lark20: lucky escape in hearts|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to ruff the Q in @S is a error|pg||
nt|bridge_one: lose a trick|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|pc|d3|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h8|nt|iain sime: West pitched a diamond on the third heart, which saved a mis-guess.|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: director as exposed card|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Most players play that a king lead asks partner to unblock an honour: they would know that North had AJ so would find a switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: club played and diamond exposed|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Compulsory to call the director, though it does not look as if the exposed card will affect the outcome|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cuttysark: Another good board for the Scots, who have great results in both rooms|pg||
nt|iain sime: Another great result for Scotland. |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so that all is it not, if so thanks everyone..|pg||
nt|iain sime: I think we are finished here. Bye all.|pg||
nt|lark20: Bye all|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Off to the other room now - see you later!  Thank you operator, and all spectators for their perceptive comments|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bridge_one: North know that declarer dont have losing cards out (only 1@H) so must keep 10xxx in @c|pg||
pc|hA|mc|9|nt|bridge_one: Bye All !|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: that's all.|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu all :) |pg||
nt|bg: yes but then E tosses losing dia|pg||
