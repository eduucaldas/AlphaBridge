nt|Walddk2: Then you could bid 3@S over 2NT and proceed with 4@C over 3NT|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: All very easy for us. I think 3NT is practical|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: True - but it looks a big position to take.|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|andyv:  3N certainly safe as cards lie|pg||

pc|sA|nt|andyv:  in CR, auction went 1@h 2@d and now N jumped to 4@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You would not want to ruff two clubs as the alternative line. Then you need @DJ to drop|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The heart suit gives better odds|pg||
