mb|p|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|athene: some would double 1@C with east's hand rather than overcalling 1@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|athene: two down, but hard to double partscores when you don't have any trump tricks|pg||

nt|rmb1: Perhaps East should do more, shame to defend an undoubled part score when slam is on two working finesses|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: i think 1D is clear on the E hand. your hand is not so good that you can strongly expect this to be your deal rather than theirs, so bid what you want led. if things die low, you ...|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Seat rage? That's a new one|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: They're contemplating how they should have started five minutes ago now.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Shame the schedule had to be altered because of volcanic ash - I am sure there will be some leeway asked and give|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: Hello all,]|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|mb|p|nt|bg: Good afternoon all|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|d|mb|2D|nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Bruce Gowdy and David Gold|pg||
mb|3C|nt|dagold: Hi all|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk7: You have been coaching E-W on BBO for a while now, isn't that correct, David?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cuttysark: Not  a deal where you want to be declarer - South might make 3@C if she can stop there|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Last time a match was delayed due to ash was in year 39 AD when the Pompeii cricket team had to cancel after a vulcano erupted|pg||
nt|dagold: double looks to be conventional|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps 4M/5+m|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: no|pg||
nt|bg: wow looks like NS came to bid!|pg||
nt|dagold: I coached Jagger-Seale|pg||
nt|Walddk7: oh right|pg||
nt|dagold: Simon Cope coached Gross-Brock mostly|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: Cope coaches them.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: We saw Adamson/Symons here in the first half - I rather think this must be one of the wek NT pairs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|Walddk7: Good afternoon to Alan Shillitoe|pg||
nt|the saint: Afternoon all|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: the double wasn't alerted, just the 2@C|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|dagold: Gross has played her partner to be very light|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dagold: so double musty have been conventional|pg||

pc|dT|nt|the saint: 4Major + 5 Minor possibly?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|dagold: I am sure it is|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c7|nt|cuttysark: Simple line would work if spades were 3-3, or @DA was onside|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h4|pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|dagold: but a good game albeit light on high cards has been missed at both tables...|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|cuttysark: or there was a misdefence|pg||

mb|3D|nt|eamongall: 1st round standings|pg||
nt|rmb1: Both pairs play a weak NT.  EW play a prepared club and five card majors|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: double of 1@D was not textbook, was it?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c6|nt|eamongall: rightsided the lead anyway |pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: i thought officially 1@C (1@D) X was exactly 44 majors - admittedly that is a bit of a silly idea|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Helene Thygesen|pg||
nt|helene_t:  thanks Roland|pg||
nt|dagold: Seale and Jagger have reached 5@d in the match against Wales|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|Walddk4: Operator, could we please have player names up?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|3D|an|Pre-emptive]|nt|vugraphzhb: Yes sorry, forgot|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I see them in profile, but that's not quite enough|pg||
nt|the saint: It will be easier to reach over a club opening as that will help highlight the lack of wastage - strong NT made things more ambiguous|pg||
nt|dagold: 4@h needs to be played by west|pg||
nt|dagold: but I doubt it will be|pg||
nt|dagold: P-P now 3@h from east|pg||
nt|the saint: If Gross is thinking about bidding, it can only be X I presume|pg||
nt|dagold: I think so but I think pass is clear|pg||
nt|bg: what would a 2d cue bid have nmeant from E instead of 1 S?|pg||
mb|d|mb|5D|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: NS are Veronica Guy and Sam Punch, who had a long lie this morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: a good raise in England Bruce|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: She wasn't thinking, I just missed the double before it went through.|pg||
nt|dagold: double was a large overbid with KJ of diamonds and not 3@s|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|helene_t:  Jean Hand and Mary Lee from North Wales, they play variable 1NT, multi, two-suited weak 2@h/@s openings, 4-card amjors|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: disaster!|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|cuttysark: A diamond lead would probably beat this - the spade gave declarer a tempo, and she can take advantage of the diamond blockage|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|dagold: so more imps for ireland it seems as this is an easy 500|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|cuttysark: hard for Sam to realise that partner's spades were not stronger|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|cT|nt|helene_t:  the bold 3NT bid may have been successful in attracting the spade lead, if she went through 4th suit forcing, N may have infered that W had five spades|pg||
pc|hK|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
mc|9|nt|dagold: West was at fault there|pg||

pc|c7|nt|athene: if you find yourself opening 1@C on that north hand (which is sensible of course) then why not just say you are playing strong NT in third?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am confused by the pass over 1S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: yes, 1nt rebid looks ok|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rmb1: North took the opportunity to pick off East's suit.  South joined in my bidding East's second suit, not the best outcome.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: you only pass partner's response if you really are subminimum opener|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, or 3 spades|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|s8|pc|d8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we will let Brian deal with it in a Daily Bulletin article|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: (for any spectators who have missed this little gem, Burn's Law Of Total Trumps says that if you are declarer in a suit contract it helps to have more trumps than the defenders|pg||
pc|dT|pc|sT|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|eamongall: Its possible Mr Burn is not far away .. |pg||
pc|s9|pc|dK|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s2|pc|h5|pc|d9|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: although it is not difficult to construct a deal where the only grand slam is in a suit where the opps have more than you do|pg||

nt|bg: maybe a double of 1 dia would have been best for EW|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|dagold: yes maybe|pg||
nt|dagold: but 1@s is hardly unreasonable|pg||
nt|dagold: interesting 1@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|dagold: mainly for the lead |pg||
nt|the saint: The difficulty with X in those positions, is that it is always very hard to then get your 5-5ness across|pg||
mb|2C|an|undiscussed apparently|nt|dagold: yes. 2@d as both majors is playable|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: The variable NT means this is a strong one - still 3NT looks quite a bold bid to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: at the other table, they lead a low club so 4@H made.|pg||
nt|dagold: Mcgee did indeed double|pg||
nt|dagold: so the 5@h bid hardly cost|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dagold: Brock would like slightly better intermediates to lead a club|pg||
nt|dagold: the 8 or the 9|pg||
nt|dagold: looks like 1 down|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|cuttysark: A strong 10 - promises a higher honour and a broken sequence with H109 or HJ10 - will make short owrk of this|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@d, 2@c, 1@h, 1@s|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|helene_t:  do we know about the NS lead style? Jack is standad from KJT but the agreement that the ten shows two honors above is common here|pg||
pc|dT|nt|cuttysark: Fortunately for the Welsh the location of the major suit kings means that 2NT was also down|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s9|pc|d8|nt|dagold: I prefer double of 2@c by south|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|helene_t:  ah right, strong ten. thanks, Liz|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dagold: more flexible|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dagold: might have conceded 2@c doubled here of course!|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|cuttysark: Many players play that the ten shows 0 or 2 higher, but that is not terribly popular in Scotland|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c5|pg||
nt|dagold: 1@s in the other room on an ugly auction so 3 imps to Ireland it seems|pg||
mc|7|nt|dagold: the EBU team need some imps|pg||
pg||
qx|o24|st||md|2SK7632H3DA76CK732,SATHAQJ97DJ54CT96,SQ95HT8652DKT9CJ5,SJ84HK4DQ832CAQ84|sv|o|nt|rmb1: But that requires a better suit than A432|pg||
mb|1N|nt|eamongall: I see the @H contract was played the other way up on 22 and doubled and one level higher and one less trick |pg||
nt|marlowepi: on previous hand, opening 1C for the lead is a good tactic, but it does more or less commit you to rebidding 1N if E overcalls a major and pd makes a neg X|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: just as a general point of bidding, i think lots of people after opening in 3 or 4 are much too eager to pass partner's response|pg||
nt|marlowepi: obliged to concede that point robin|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: maybe out your way, bill. cant remember the last time i saw it over here|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in the US the tendency is--rightly or wrongly on any given hand--to keep the momentum going to keep opps guessing|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|hK|mc|9|pg||
qx|c24|st||md|2SK7632H3DA76CK732,SATHAQJ97DJ54CT96,SQ95HT8652DKT9CJ5,SJ84HK4DQ832CAQ84|sv|o|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: The Scots favour a weak NT style where you open 4card majors freely|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I would have expected them to reach 4@S without passing Go - and I see that they have really :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|helene_t:  2@s showing hearts and a minor (michaels cuebid)|pg||
nt|dagold: heart lead likely|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dagold: which will make this cold|pg||
nt|bg: might get them here with a heart lead and a club guess|pg||
nt|the saint: This board could be a swing opportunity for the EBU if it gets played the other way up|pg||
nt|dagold: can guess club wrong though|pg||
nt|dagold: which won't matter here|pg||
nt|dagold: needed a minor suit lead and a spade through...|pg||
nt|dagold: Ireland have right-sided it too and made 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: Is there any gain in taking the K@H??|pg||
nt|dagold: she was worried about blocking herself if she won the heart in hand|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cuttysark: More bold bidding by the Welsh East has scored a goal here|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|dagold: but she should still run it round as she could always overtake the heart later|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|dagold: so this has gone down it seems|pg||
nt|dagold: the contract was not as routine as it looks. Declarer can't see the nice club position|pg||
nt|dagold: but winning the heart king was not best|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|nt|cuttysark: North would much prefer to have her teeth into 5@D|pg||
pc|c8|nt|dagold: winning in hand then running the club T is reasonable|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dagold: if a spade comes through you can overtake the heart King and hope hearts are not worse than 4-2|pg||
nt|bg: in other room W won heart lead and lead club 10 N made mistake of covering end of defense|pg||
nt|dagold: good play by the irish west I think|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|dagold: so this is 1 down|pg||
nt|dagold: and EBU getting blitzed|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: Not if North leads a low spades and South puts up the King.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|deltadash: Sorry I'm late Alex!|pg||
nt|dagold: they came back in the first match Vs England, but this looks bad|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
nt|dagold: Well done south|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|cuttysark: Hard to imagine why East thought a heart switch was a good idea - espcially with those diamonds!|pg||

nt|athene: yes - and it works even more if your left-hand opponent is wont to lead short majors against 1nt - 3nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|rmb1: 1@S -2 on board 23 was not too much of a disaster, in the other room NS played 2NT -1|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|athene: the 5-3 spade fit might fall down the cracks in the pavement here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure what you mean. even after 1H the final contract rates to be 3N by W which makes even without heart lead|pg||
nt|eamongall: might get a chance to mention @Ss yet ...but not sure if can show 5 of them |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: some would play that after a 2/1, E rebids 3S (picture bid) to show this hand|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: it's pretty unlikely that 3nt can be the right contract, looking at that east hand|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: but after a club finesse all manner of things shall be well|pg||
nt|marlowepi: among other things, that allows 3S in a slower auction to deal with other problems|pg||
nt|eamongall: thats a nice idea after 2/1 ... picture bid |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|nt|athene: south doing her best to get declarer to go wrong in diamonds, but she doesn't really have a choice|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: that play only works when north led low from @D10xxxx and declarer has @DJ9x|pg||

nt|athene: yes|pg||
mc|7|nt|athene: huh? no way can it have been -2|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: sorry down 1 - didnt take the finesse|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|cuttysark: The sort of diamond suit you want to bid more than once - but not the sort of hand that justitifes 2 bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: 3N is not a nice bid|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dagold: 2@s is the usual acol solution|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: No double, less trouble....|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: then 4@s fom east which would show 6-5 (otherwise 3@s)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|helene_t:  Do you understand why S chose 2@h instead of a negative double, Liz? |pg||
nt|cuttysark: She wanted to get the 6-card suit over: if you double, then bid hearts you show a weaker hand - also North may convert to spades with 2-3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|dagold: 3N could be down with 6@c on for example|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bg: 2 spades yes since 2 c not forcing have to make a game bid|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|dagold: meanwhile 4@h is easy|pg||

pc|h2|nt|dagold: yes Bruce. 2/1 is easier|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cuttysark: Sam  can be farily sure there is no club overruff, so all she needs is diamonds 3-3, 2 finesses and a couple of extra entries to dummy|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Only 50s :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I like to get these hands over quickly|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: south having a long tank.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not an auction, or a contract, on which I wish to dwell|pg||

nt|athene: perhaps this sort of auction is an example of why people play these 2@C/@D openers to show 18-19 balanced|pg||

nt|vugraphzhb: We restart at 14:15|pg||
mb|1D|nt|cuttysark: I do not have a VP scale handy for 24 boards, but I imagine Scotland must have a near maximum win here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: EW play a variable NT, strong when vulnerable|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: at the moment, probably 25-1.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|dagold: chances here for EBU too|pg||
nt|the saint: To lead a top honour there is only going to work on almost that exact layout|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dagold: there are some more Alan but low of course is reasonable|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: West waved her hand at her 3NT bid.|pg||
nt|dagold: 3N= strong diamond hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: then when it went under the table she muttered oh crap.|pg||
nt|dagold: now maybe 4@c-4@s-4N?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.elsid.co.za/bridge/templates/vpscale.html  here you are, Liz|pg||
nt|cuttysark: this lead makes it easy - another 3NT ontract where Scotland gain a game swing - seems to be their strength|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk4: So 24-6 at the moment|pg||
nt|dagold: now 4N perhaps|pg||
nt|dagold: which wpuld get them there|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Not that 3NT is beatable - the auction in the other room shows that NS had not discussed their defesive methods over a potentially 3card club suit|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|the saint: Next door, NS cramped the auction, and West's 4@S bid never came close to describing the power of her hand.|pg||
nt|dagold: Well done!|pg||
nt|the saint: All Sally needs is 'bullets'|pg||
nt|dagold: this is a good team board for EBU assuming nothing goes wrong from here|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: West taking a long time to count her key cards.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5S|nt|Walddk4: and 25-4 after this board|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Very good start for the holders|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: she will count again maybe |pg||
nt|dagold: looks like 5@d may have been the wrong response|pg||
nt|dagold: that or 5@s is the wrong call but I suspect 5@d was the problem|pg||
nt|the saint: Yes, if 5@D was right, then East will have certainly bid 6.|pg||
mb|6C|nt|the saint: Even if West corrects, there may be 'tempo' issues perhaps?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|dagold: aha|pg||
nt|dagold: what has happened here?|pg||
nt|bg: something unknown about this auction|pg||
nt|dagold: did Suzzanna realise she had missbid over 4N and then offer 6@c?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|dagold: I am not sure|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Surely she tested clubs before cahing the second heart???|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzhb: She did, sorry.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk4: Thanks Liz, Helene and Alex|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: Break for lunch now. Restart in about 45 minutes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bye for now|pg||
nt|cuttysark: You are forgiven Alex - I know how tough it is to watch all the cards. Thank you for a gtreat job|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: England vs. Wales|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: EBU vs. Ireland|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: and N Ireland vs. Scotland.|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c8|mc|12|nt|dagold: I am not sure if this was brilliantly bid or what but I will find out!|pg||
nt|dagold: so a great comeback by the EBU team|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: final score is 17-13 to Ireland.|pg||
nt|dagold: who were being blitzed not so long a go|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: next match starts at 18:00|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: England vs. Scotland|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: EBU vs. N Ireland|pg||
nt|dagold: Thanks Alex|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: and Ireland vs. Wales.|pg||
