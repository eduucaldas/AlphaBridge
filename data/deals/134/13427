mb|1S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgx: it is yes :)|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill: rehi ian, hi kath|pg||
mb|2H|nt|heatherd: NS weren't in a great spot. Depending on my NT range I prefer to either open or rebid 1NT on this hand.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|djneill: hi heather|pg||
nt|idc: great to see a few veterans playing again for england in this team|pg||
mb|3H|nt|heatherd: Kath - I don't think nevena bid 2@s?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: Maybe I should have put veterans in inverted commas in case I get in trouble|pg||
nt|djneill: yes that was the world's most delayed game try|pg||
nt|heatherd: Hi Dan|pg||
nt|heatherd: Sorry!|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: she did|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|djneill: some people open 1@d with North's hand, rebidding 2@c|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|djneill: not some, e.g. garozzo, fantoni (they open @c)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Shame on them|pg||
nt|heatherd: I don't like that either - you get put back to 2@d on a doubleton.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Shame on the 1@D openers that is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless you play a canapé system|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|idc: I know nobody likes to miss a game at teams but Nevena was punishing her partner for protecting here|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|idc: just an extra 50 mnd you|pg||
nt|djneill: canape = open 4 card suit, rebid 5+ card suit (just the reverse of most systems)|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s3|nt|djneill: safe to say nevena (East) is an aggressive bidder|pg||
nt|heatherd: If Sandra had had a decent hand she could have bid on the first round.|pg||
nt|idc: costs 2 tricks if West doesn't ruff this high|pg||
nt|idc: I say 'high' : it is a bit relative|pg||

nt|roswolf: a bit unnecessary to go -3 though|pg||
nt|ady: bad start for England    |pg||
nt|paulg:  there was an aggressive takeout double by East in the other room, otherwise it is hard to see how EW get into the auction|pg||
nt|henryb:  That was in 1970 $ which were worth about five of todays in purchasing power|pg||
nt|jtr: If it was a bluff (rather than a misunderstanding) then well done South|pg||
nt|ahh: now theres an everyday score |pg||
nt|roswolf: wow an unusual score in the other room|pg||
nt|roswolf: someone forgot to double|pg||
nt|ahh: only thing missing from auction is a final double |pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/lady-milne-trophy  for streaming TV. First time on BBO|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chick: Good afternoon everyone and welcome back to Hamar in Norway for the annual Olrud Easter Festival.|pg||
nt|athene: well NS can make ten tricks in hearts here but i don't see many pairs bidding 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: http://www.bridgesenteret.no/|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s managed to jam the bidding somewhat|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S   unlcuky to go down in OR|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: south will surely not want to bid 4@H - she will imagine that is just going to push EW into a making 4@S|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H should make, with the double making @CA easy to locate |pg||
nt|ady: might even stretch to 4 here|pg||
nt|athene: she might consider some sort of fit bid in clubs perhaps|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|athene: west is just going to bid 4@S anyway, whatever south does, surely?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jtr: Steam age Acol bidding next door  But well stopped anyway|pg||
nt|ahh: Geoffrey and i are telepathic we are identical twins |pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Swiss Teams, 12 rounds of 8-board matches. This is a match from round 12.|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks good for scotland|pg||
mb|2S|nt|henryb:  harder to avoid losing this AK if you bid a slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Our operator today is Andre Hagen, hi Andre :)|pg||
nt|chick: Your commentators are Baard Olav Aasan and Carl Mathiesen, Norway, Ralf Willquist, Sweden, and I am Cornelia Yoder, USA.|pg||
nt|baardolav: Hello all|pg||
nt|chick: Hamar is on the shores of Lake Mjosa, the largest lake in Norway.|pg||
nt|petepunt: tendency to dbl on east hand these days whereas originaly players would pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the axe might fall|pg||
nt|ady: yes 4@H can make   |pg||
nt|roswolf: no just a couple of imps probably|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Hello Marshall|pg||
nt|chick: Welcome Marshall|pg||
nt|petergill: A @d lead might beat even 2@S, as the cards lie|pg||
nt|jtr: East may make a move now|pg||
nt|jtr: Depending on the inference of 4@s|pg||
nt|jtr: For me it shows something like AKx, xx, xxx, KQxxx|pg||
nt|ewj: pretty dubious auction, but -250 hardly a disaster|pg||
nt|ahh: anyhow for all those who know me  you will be interested to hear i am 4 weeks into a football coaching course at Aberdeen football club  training like a maniac with loads of 17 ...|pg||
nt|ahh: year olds|pg||
pc|c5|nt|paulg:  this looks a more standard auction|pg||
nt|lark20: Should make for a small swing to Scotland|pg||
nt|petepunt: N,  likely to misguess @C after the x|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|ady: North can hardly be confident of 2 trump tricks and south has no double of 4@S opposite a weak 2|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ralfwil: -1 after a @d lead|pg||
nt|petepunt: S had tough 2nd bid|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|henryb:  In my world partner would have a hand like AKxx xx xx KQJxx|pg||
nt|jtr: They should stop anyway But a @h lead beats it|pg||
nt|jtr: Pedant:)|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|baardolav: A good start for Smith's|pg||
nt|petepunt: 2N might have put her partner of 5@D|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lark20: Hearts can be discarded on Diamonds|pg||
nt|henryb:  Good spades, good clubs, no red controls|pg||
pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: 2S clearly not GF as otherwise N would probably bid just 2N|pg||
nt|jtr: Not unreasonable to lead a @h if you think|pg||
pc|s6|nt|petergill: At the other table, Sandra Penfold didn't open a weak 2@H, perhaps influenced by the theory: "never open a weak two when you have a limit raise or better in the other major"|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rmb1: Difficult for NS to double, neither North or South can rely on partner for any defence|pg||
nt|mikeirl: H discardwouldbebetter|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: ok...|pg||
nt|bg: oops now N has a chance if she guess the clubs|pg||
nt|ahh: the Scottish Bridge Union made me do it as part of me physical training for Ostend |pg||
pc|s3|pc|h2|nt|mikeirl: better|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jtr: They are likely to be off 2 keycards and nothing else|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h5|nt|petepunt: after 3 rounfs of @D N may be abke to work this one out ?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|pg||
nt|petepunt: East has 3433 or 4432 shape is the Q|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: i think it's good to have lots of spades when you open a weak-2@H - it means you can beat opps when they get into spades (as they are wont to do after you open 2@H) :)|pg||

nt|djneill: @s fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: ok @d fit but yeah well :-)|pg||
mb|2H|an|wk|nt|djneill: aukward hand for West|pg||
nt|heatherd: They have just made an UCB|pg||
mb|d|nt|djneill: double, or 3@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|heatherd: Double works well|pg||
nt|idc: tempting just to bid game now|pg||
nt|djneill: good choice but does it make 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: sandra looks at conv card of scotland|pg||
nt|idc: needs so little (Qxxx spades and any number of clubs will give it play)|pg||
nt|heatherd: East isn't guaranteed to have 4@s here|pg||
nt|djneill: entries may be a problem here - need late entries to both establish and use the @c|pg||
mb|3S|nt|djneill: but South can overruff unless 2 spades are drawn too early|pg||
nt|idc: I guess if 3@h is a strong game try for spades then that is possible (i prefer to use it for other hands)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|heatherd: It's likely that a @d trick will disappear|pg||

nt|athene: 3NT looks very reachable here for NS|pg||
nt|ahh: so 1st blood to Scotland|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps not so easily makeable|pg||
nt|roswolf: the english e/w missed the boatr here|pg||
nt|ewj: can barely call it blood, had a chance there did Scotland|pg||
mb|2H|nt|petergill: So far, three games needing finesses to work so far, but the finesses have been failing. |pg||
nt|jtr: 4@s here but not easy to reach|pg||
nt|ewj: two aces, 3 trumps, singleton in partner's suit|pg||
nt|ahh: difficult to see them bidding game |pg||
nt|ewj: could easily have doubled|pg||
nt|ahh: lebensohl over the double shows east has nothing |pg||
mb|3C|nt|petepunt: many would come in with S,  but pass is good|pg||
nt|jtr: Brown may double|pg||
nt|jtr: More as a way of finding a sacrifice if they bid 41hs|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@hs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, she is going to bid 2@S if you double|pg||
nt|ewj: might even be imps to england|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now they will miss it for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 3NT looks reasonable when both black kings are over the aces, but difficult to bid or play|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed n/s missed the boat in the other room - in their sequence i wonder whether 3@D was intended to be forcing?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess it's a matter of style, but I'd probably respond 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: perhaps questionable whether S should remove to 4S given total lack of help in red suits & great concentration in blacks....bid N had exploratory options at the three level that he ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: shunned, so to S it may have sounded like he was being warned off|pg||
nt|roswolf: tes this should be passed out|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: 3@C will go down |pg||
nt|ahh: no dummy entries |pg||
nt|roswolf: oh well imps back to the ebu|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: was east's pass alerted!?|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s may well play walsh|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah she is going to show a raise to 3@h|pg||
nt|ahh: 6 to England and the lead |pg||
pc|d4|nt|petergill: At the other table, Moore followed the modern practice of opening on almost anything when in 3rd seat with fav vulnerability|pg||
nt|roswolf: 15-17 rebid by north|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that east didn't bid 2@C over 1nt in the other room - perhaps they play that as majors or something|pg||
nt|paulg:  and I'd probably try to play 1NT this time|pg||
pc|d7|nt|petergill: 3NT looks worth a punt, vul at imps|pg||
nt|petergill: but Susan Stockdale might prefer to explore|pg||
nt|athene: if south follows an invitational sequence to 3@D north might bash 3nt in on the strength of the diamond fit|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahh: sorry EBU  there are 2 english teams  this 1 is EBU|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: e.g. 2@C - 2@D - 3@D|pg||
nt|athene: playing 2-way checkback|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||
nt|henryb:  If so, why not just bid it?|pg||
nt|jtr: 9 losers doesnt warrant it|pg||
nt|jtr: Because an immediate 3@h is weak|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ahh: the other is England  both will think there are no 1 team |pg||
nt|ahh: *they|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: this is invitational i think|pg||
nt|athene: for any specs unfamiliar with this method, south's 2@C forces 2@D, after which all her bids are natural and invitational|pg||
nt|athene: south's 2@D over 1nt would be artificial game force|pg||
nt|petergill: For profiles of the players, click on the player's name at http://www.ebu.co.uk/|pg||
nt|roswolf: and 3nt looks eminently reasonable for north|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  likely to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed it is the practical shot|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: N does not have enough side strength to start with a trump, but queen of spades is probably a better shot than small|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|petergill: The likely club lead to the ace, then 9@C back, leaves declarer awkwardly placed|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think Stockdale might have doubled 2@c|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: this will be the first major swing to someone|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: on a club lead, if north works out what is going on, her only chance is to play west for the @SA, as otherwise east has an entry for her good clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: On the @d's, East is likely to discard a spade, a heart and either: two clubs or "one club and the last spade" - very interesting hand|pg||
nt|ady: not quite true    could also play east for A@S and rise with KC on club return|pg||
nt|athene: but north also has the option of winning the @CK on the second round of the suit and trying to keep west off lead|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: no sorry  could not make in such a case|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|petergill: So playing 3NT at the other table, where the bidding had made West likely to have @SA, would be easier than playing 3NT at this table, with no revealing EW bidding|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|henryb:  In fact should have|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|athene: if the clubs get set up, north can't e.g. try @HA, heart to the @H10, as even if that forced the @HK, west could still put east in with the @SA|pg||
nt|petergill: A spade can be spared from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: so basically north has to play west for the @SA anyway|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: looks like must make now|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahh: no luck for declarer 3 3 @C break would have been nice |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: ?|pg||
nt|petergill: Not true - there is also the possibility that East gets squeezed if East has @SA, @HJ and the clubs|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h9|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h5|pc|dA|pc|c9|pg||
nt|jtr: accident possibilities|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|petepunt: easier if S had bid as @C to ace more marked|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahh: last chance goes QJ @S doubleton |pg||
pc|sK|nt|jtr: oh dear|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: would put money on this making|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|nt|jtr: I wonder if E/W play Rusinow leads?|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|petergill: Me too|pg||
nt|athene: yes but playing east for @SA and @HJ is surely less tempting that just playing west for @SA?|pg||
nt|athene: *than just|pg||
mc|8|nt|petergill: West is discarding like a person with @SA|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|heatherd: Can't be right. She should surely discard a @c|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|djneill: North was afraid of a 4-2@d break (else East overrufs and gets West another @c ruff)|pg||

nt|rmb1: Difficult for EW to paint a false picture for declarer|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|baardolav: The leaders, Levbird,  need 16 VP to secure the victory of this tournament|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: True|pg||
nt|paulg:  i find it hard to believe that North made 4@s on this hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am sorry to say that this has been mis-scored in the open room|pg||
nt|jtr: Apparently not which makes South's play strange|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@s seems lay down|pg||
nt|ahh: well done by east in other room   north was unlucky perhaps  lets see |pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk4: 620 EW it should have been but nothing happens when I message the operator|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i would reopen with a double|pg||
nt|ahh: 2@H works better if north bids @C |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: need careful defense to 3N|pg||
nt|athene: it was hard for NS to get into the auction in the other room, but North solves their problem here|pg||
nt|paulg:  ok, thanks Roland|pg||
nt|lark20: That is more like it. Thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: would have, anyway|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3C NF?|pg||
nt|petergill: Fiona Brown's 1@H overcall on four cards is infinitely superior to a takeout double with only two spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4 card suit overcall by Fiona has got n/s into the bidding|pg||
nt|athene: i guess this might be an imp for 140 vs 100|pg||
nt|paulg:  Another style question is whether to raise 1@s or bid 2@c|pg||
nt|ahh: well passed north |pg||
nt|roswolf: well call me yellow but 31C by north as bid in the other room looks manic to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: THE ENGLISH GAIN A SUBSTANTIAL SWING|pg||
pc|dK|nt|paulg:  it should not make a lot of difference here, as East will normally raise clubs and you might then support spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: surely good enough to raise spades later|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: maybe declarer has too much work to do to get the overtrick|pg||
nt|henryb:  really?|pg||
nt|jtr: ah declarer didnt play the @hQ at trick one|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: although she has a pretty good idea of the trump layout|pg||
nt|jtr: oh maybe you cant do it anyway|pg||
nt|jtr: Not easily anyway|pg||
nt|henryb:  well, you can: @hQKA, @c to J and A, @h ruff, @dA, @cK, spades|pg||
nt|jtr: or just @ss then @c|pg||
nt|jtr: Declarer wont know the lead is a singleton|pg||
nt|henryb:  The suggested line above is better as it does not need the muracle spade position|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me it looks like 4@h is the best contrace  - while I can see all cards|pg||
nt|athene: from the 1nt bid|pg||
nt|ahh: well north south have balance of points 3nt from south not far off if @D break |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|paulg:  yes, I think it is East's pass that is a little pessimistic |pg||
nt|jtr: Playing for @hs 5-2 and ruffing a @d seems reasonable|pg||
pc|d2|nt|baardolav: 3@c is non forcing... 5@c is not a bad contract, need the @c 3-3, like 3nt...|pg||
nt|chick: was a nice bid by S, considering his void in @Cs, but unfortunately the trump split sinks this contract|pg||
nt|petergill: Fiona lives with Hugh McGann from Ireland - Hugh would not be impressed if she didn't bid 1@H at the highly suitable vulnerability|pg||
nt|ady: best to play clubs now|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jtr: Wow great play|pg||
nt|ewj: well it basically has no legitimate play in @D break|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: establish toe 2 club tricks before ruffing any further diamonds which would allow east to discard clubs|pg||
nt|athene: yes, when the third round of clubs stands up declarer has 140|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|lark20: The pass prevented west being able to raise spades "later"|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jtr: No, that wont work actually|pg||
nt|jtr: You cant finesse the @hs and the @s|pg||
nt|henryb:  what won't work?|pg||
nt|jtr: Ducking a @d at trick 2|pg||
nt|jtr: or A one rather|pg||
nt|ewj: if*|pg||
nt|ewj: don't think North was especially unlucky|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petepunt: East will feel happier after this board :)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: If <36% is "not a bad contract", what is the threshold for that description?:)|pg||
nt|mikeirl: very negative, 3c appears automatic|pg||
nt|jtr: Nice switch|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|jtr: Wondering about safety play|pg||
nt|jtr: Spec points out a low @s was better play|pg||
nt|henryb:  now has to decide whether to play a low spade to protect against 4-1 spades or the Q to protect against a red suit ruff|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: ruff this high to prepare a finesse of the @H9 maybe|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ewj: if you're going to bid yourself to the 3 level, you need to have more shape than  a strong no trump|pg||
nt|ahh: 2@H is totally unwieldy contract as well|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|bg: could make three if she trys spade |pg||
pc|c3|pc|s3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N had chances other than the club split, though in practice most of the time that is what you will play for|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d8|nt|roswolf: this is not playing too well|pg||
nt|ahh: going to be cut off from her @S winners |pg||
pc|c4|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ahh: and a trump now |pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|c2|nt|athene: not strictly necessary with the @CJ as an entry, but probably gets you an extra style point |pg||

nt|jtr: Low @s would have catered for that possibility|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes David|pg||
nt|jtr: Lots of value from that hand|pg||
nt|jtr: That is the first time you have agreed with me in 30 years:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  no; the second I think|pg||
nt|ahh: 12 imps |pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a coffee hand brb|pg||
nt|ahh: routine 3nt on this board |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: did well to bid and make 4@H in OR|pg||
nt|athene: well done to bid game on 23 hcp and no long suits - but it should be flat|pg||
nt|petepunt: might well go 1@S 2@S 4@S|pg||
nt|henryb:  :))|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess it must be early in the morning for you|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  I was watching vugraph a couple of weeks ago when Michael Rosenberg was commentating|pg||
nt|ahh: east opened 2nt in other room east here may take slower route|pg||
mb|2N|nt|baardolav: It feel like a bad start for Livebird... going down in two games now|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
nt|paulg:  he said he never passed out an opening bid in fourth|pg||
nt|paulg:  independent of how many spades he had|pg||
nt|henryb:  am still on first cup of coffee|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: There had to be a reason|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: playing ACOL, i think the idea is, if you open 1minor and give a single raise to partner's major, that is always a good hand, as you promise a strong notrump or an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  Many use the Pearson Rule .. points + number of spades should be at least 15|pg||
nt|paulg:  this hand meets any criteria for opening|pg||
nt|jtr: this will make if they stick it|pg||
mb|d|nt|petergill: 23 + 3 for the singleton + 1 for the doubleton = 27, once the fit is found|pg||
nt|athene: so partner is encouraged to move quite aggressively here|pg||
nt|rmb1: I don't think the heart pips were good enough to allow North to ruff high.|pg||
nt|athene: it's very different from a strong notrump structure where west typically has balanced rubbish for this|pg||
nt|roswolf: east may try a trial bid|pg||
nt|athene: on the previous hand? north could ruff with the @H10?|pg||
nt|petergill: The 4-1 trump break might make the play of 4@h tricky|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: maybe, but it is routine to get to game on both hands, and all games fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: So will this|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: but i prefer the game raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: -9 on 2@c two down...|pg||
nt|henryb:  I only see 6 tricks for declarer, and seven for the defense|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahh: 3@S looks like transfer to 3nt  |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|petergill: South led a club at the other table|pg||
nt|petergill: This lead is much more promising for the defence|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h, 2@d and a @c|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ahh: so direct 3nt by west must show 5@S and 4@H |pg||
pc|d6|nt|jtr: Isnt South in trouble on the 4th @c?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Maybe S can be strip squeezed|pg||
pc|d7|nt|baardolav: Can make +1 here for I belive... find the Kx in @c|pg||
nt|chick: For those wondering, we are not broadcasting the other table of this match, but the scores from it are being entered by our operator for comparisons|pg||
nt|chick: Results and standings at http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=olrud2010swiss|pg||
nt|athene: yes, declarer would surely like to lead diamonds towards dummy and get a spade discard|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess they can unblock the @ds|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think East is in trouble before that|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: yes, a very likely play in the club suit since W did all the bidding|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzgz: 3@D is SP apparently|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes if South holds up the @c|pg||
pc|dT|nt|petergill: I think declarer needed to duck that spade|pg||
nt|petergill: and she might be in trouble now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: he is planning to take club finesse|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|baardolav: Dont think so... Ovesen have already shown the @s Q|pg||
nt|chick: might as well, even if he knows it will likely fail|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: now @DA and the spades|pg||
nt|paulg:  but perhaps not as SP as the @d2? :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: In very big trouble now|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: and @HJ as over-ruff for very easy one down|pg||
nt|athene: i think declarer was a little too hasty to win that first trick|pg||
nt|ady: should go down now|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|athene: surely spades 4-2 was far more likely than 5-1 - especially in view of no 1@S overcall from north|pg||
nt|ady: yes  taking first spade not good|pg||
nt|athene: (who as we have seen isn't overly scared of bidding things)|pg||
nt|petergill: Susan will play another spade, but Susan likes to think things though before she does the play she intends to do - a good habit, in my opinion|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: it is clear to play ace of clubs on the bidding, the question is why not do it before the heart|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: when he led a heart toward dummy instead of starting on his die suit, which would be normal technique, it looked like he was planning to finesse clubs|pg||

nt|idc: the 7 would be the normal NS systemic card to lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: "mud"|pg||
nt|idc: they play MUD from 3 or more low|pg||
nt|djneill: is the @hT low|pg||
nt|heatherd: Roland's favourite!|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Give me a break|pg||
pc|dK|nt|idc: but were I South I'd assume North had T8xx(..) from that lead|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|chessmaste: Declarer must consider that South's double may show club length - then you might just go for the cross ruff|pg||

nt|idc: Hi Mark|pg||
nt|heatherd: Not sure why she didn't lead the 9@h on the previous trick|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: Then she would have to lead spades from hand|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|heatherd: She can endplay S for 1 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It was a hopeless case no matter what|pg||
mc|10|nt|chessmaste: However, a spade to the king is the practical line - so South gets some credit for a thin double|pg||
nt|idc: I see Sally Brock passed over 2@h in the other room, on the hand where NS here lost 500 in 3@dx|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: nevena telling her  how to make  it|pg||
nt|idc: 2@h drifted one down and EBU gained 12 IMPs|pg||

nt|athene: unless she upgrades it to a 20 count on the strength of the diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: west may try to intervene|pg||
nt|petepunt: anyone for a 1@S overcall ?|pg||
nt|jtr: Nice slam|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe 6@s is slightly better but impossible to bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: got it wrong|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rmb1: Heart suit is worth degrading|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: with hearts 4-4 n/s can make 3NT    only normal chance of game|pg||
nt|petergill: South at the other table added a point or two for her long suit, hence she treated her hand as 20 HCP, as most experts would. |pg||
mb|2C|nt|petepunt: :)|pg||
nt|bg: Y I like it|pg||
nt|petepunt: i will type quieter :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  somehow 6@s by East looks a lot better than 6@h by W|pg||
nt|ahh:  credit Sheila Macdonald with the swing |pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: but if you play some cute bid to show 18-19, you probably try to treat as many hands as possible as 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|roswolf: cautious by west even considering the vul|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be a flat board nevertheless|pg||
nt|jtr: Were you geting more coffee?|pg||
nt|henryb:  6@s is cold: declarer fraws trumps and sets up hearts|pg||
nt|henryb:  can make even if @h 4-1|pg||
nt|jtr: @c lead and @hs are 4-1 might beat it|pg||
nt|henryb:  In 6@s declarer wins the opening lead, draws trumps and ducks a heart|pg||
mb|3N|nt|baardolav: Seems like The Livebirds have their worst result in this last match... |pg||
nt|rmb1: As 2NT is 20-22 it would make sense to downgrade some 20 HCP hands to 2@D than upgrade 19s to 2NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  that's a pretty strong 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|petepunt: not so good on @HA lead|pg||
nt|ahh: look at overcall in other room obviously @D are a Scots girls best friend |pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: sry @Ha switch|pg||
nt|jtr: Surely @hs are agreed here?|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes, David, if @h 4-1, a club lead with the @cQ off, and a losing diamond finesse|pg||
nt|jtr: She may bid 6NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: W giving it plenty thought|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: can beat this 2 tricks with a club start|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2@S forces 2nt and denies 4 spades (the idea being to avoid responder ever playing it)|pg||
nt|jtr: KQJxx@hs and a few things would make that ok|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: can make 5@D  by playing Q@C  but an unlikely lay|pg||
nt|petergill: South = 19.4 HCP according to the useful tool http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AQ8+J95+AKJ74+A3|pg||
nt|petergill: i.e. the Kaplans - Rubens Evaluator|pg||
nt|athene: this method of having a 2@C/2@D bid to show 18-19 balanced or thereabouts is quite popular amongst the top italian pairs - i think they do it to take some load off their 1@C opener|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks a push|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: well - S had doubled...|pg||
nt|ahh: this  should not make |pg||
pc|d9|nt|jtr: 6NT is a good 2nd to 6@s|pg||
nt|jtr: West thinks @ss are the keycard suit it seems|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes, and with the @d double, she will surely prefer @s or NT to @h|pg||
nt|jtr: NT i think|pg||
nt|jtr: Which might also make if @hs are 4-1|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: that last swing was probably caused by the 2D bid, which allowed E to bid in leisurely fashion. a more space-consuming jump would have put a lot of pressure on E|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. the idea is it isn't especially good when you open 2@D but it is better when you open 1@C and it can't be strong balanced|pg||
nt|lark20: I think their 1NT rebid is 15-17|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petergill: and it allows the jump 2NT rebid by opener to be artificial, and if playing a weak 1NT (as NS do) it takes pressure off the 15-19 NT rebids  |pg||
pc|d4|nt|paulg:  yes, the spade shortage is a minus, but most other things are positive|pg||
nt|bg: why would S duck?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jtr: What did i say earlier about impossible:)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|jtr: A well earned IMP anyway maybe|pg||
pc|d7|nt|paulg:  with the soft values, North wants to invite both 3NT and 4@s|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|jtr: If she plays the criss-cross squeeze|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lark20: How do you play the spades for 2 losers?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|petepunt: N wont have 3@H amd the @D honor u need to defeat so !AH is a fair shot|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|paulg:  can only do it by claiming|pg||
nt|henryb:  Now she can make 7 on a round suit squeeze, or rather on a double with clubs the middle suit|pg||
pc|h9|nt|baardolav: Good switch from Eide... |pg||
nt|chick: at the start of this match, Liverbird was 1st (with 207 VPs) and Smith 6th.  2nd place had 197, so if Liverbird loses this and the 2nd place team wins their match, they could ...|pg||
nt|chick: overtake Liverbird to win|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looking like a love possibility at the mopment|pg||
nt|sharkey: Do you agree with Ovesen's 2 NT - seems like a lot of bidding....?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahh: so N?S make 3nt |pg||
pc|s5|nt|baardolav: 2@C is probably a kind of checkback|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|baardolav: so Ovesen show a maximum hand with 2N|pg||
nt|jtr: Has to be criss-cross surely?|pg||

nt|ahh: 5@D good   3nt bad |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: declined|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahh: pass bad :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chick: I'm guessing that 2@D showed hearts|pg||

nt|henryb:  I am going to guess a @d lead, and then should make this|pg||

nt|ahh: the lesson here is that EBU are comprehensively outbidding the Scots and deserve their lead |pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment jim|pg||

nt|petergill: At the other table, Nevena Senior (South) doesn't like to stay out of game - the rather nice dummy wasn't enough|pg||
nt|athene: south's 4@S in the other room was a bit of a 2-way shot i suppose - with so many spades, you don't want to agonize over 4@H/4@S decisions, so just solve matters right away|pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: Brandsnes and Kaare Kristiansen, for bringing this fine event to BBO!|pg||

nt|lark20: Very strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  many would play that 3@c shows the black suits here|pg||
nt|djneill: identical weak 1NT opening both rooms, South has distribution but likely no convention to show that - double reserved for penalty|pg||
nt|roswolf: may well be another push|pg||
pc|cA|nt|paulg:  having passed up the opportunity to bid 3@c on the first round|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Seems like 3NT is cold unless you find the double dummy lead of @DQ|pg||

nt|roswolf: this looks finis -e/w are too passive|pg||
pc|d5|nt|baardolav: Need a double now...|pg||
nt|petergill: Chris Duckworth, at the sutiable vulnerability, might have doubled 1@S, or 2@s, for take-out|pg||
nt|athene: partscores aren't just for matchpoints - they can be 6-imp swings too|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|rmb1: Helpful lead for declarer, should make 9 tricks now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|petepunt: S will feel she has not done enough|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 2S is 10-13? if a standard weak 2, it is a bad idea with two aces, especially at these colors. if N wants a swing, as he should, 1S would be just fine|pg||
nt|ady: South took a sensible view that and ace and a jack and a poor 6 card suit would be unlikely to produce a game opposite around 16 hcp and possible only 2 spades|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk4: Declarer lost the third club to East who switched to a low diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Declarer played low and had five top losers|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Only chance is @DA onside|pg||
nt|paulg:  on this auction it is clear that the @dA is onside|pg||
nt|paulg:  but I guess Punch opened 1@H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @DQJ onside is not a valid point, because then the defence has five natural tricks when East switches to @DQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Blind spot when declarer followed small|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, playing the @dA is only line|pg||
nt|jtr: @d was led next door apparently|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: actually i would open 1S in any seat at any colors and any stage of match|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petepunt: a fair slam|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|sharkey: Eide's 2@S opening is a REAL weak 2 - compare with Svendsen's Muliti Vul 9xxxxxx..... a match or two ago|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree Marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for me a "real" weak two does not have 2 aces, nor is it 64 in the majors|pg||
nt|baardolav: I belive Eide Houmøller playes a weak multi and 2@h 2@s is 8-11 or someting like that|pg||
nt|chick: we also saw a previous weak 2 with two aces|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s4|nt|lark20: If west's multi can be as high as 11 points, she couls have DA instead of CQ and DQ|pg||
nt|jtr: @c10 clearer suit preference|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: At this vulnerability, you only lose 3 imps when both 2@S and your contract are "minus one"  -50 and -50 = 3 imps out |pg||
nt|paulg:  but easier here ... now thinking about club safety plays ... and decided that there was not one|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|henryb:  declarer has to be careful to avoid going 2 down|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: Not a heart surely|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: yes a heart|pg||
nt|paulg:  i hope people don't multi with AKxxxx and an ace|pg||
pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: techniocally then, the and does fit the range, but tactically it is a very dubious idea to open 2S with that sort of hand. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Did she really pitch a heart?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharkey: Also - why open weak 2 with Axxx in @H side suit?|pg||
nt|bg: wonder why N did not show a club control instead of 4 hearts?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: now declarer hasn't time to get the heart away on the long diamond|pg||
nt|athene: assuming a fairly swift heart switch from someone|pg||
nt|ady: as long as North shows some spade support I dont think e/w will buy the contract in 2 or 3@H|pg||
nt|petergill: If spades were 2-2, we commentators might use different words to describe NS's (and even West's) decisions.  |pg||
nt|rmb1: I'm sure declarer was pleased when spades were 3-1|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S might not make even with trumps 2-2 - you need the diamonds to be sort of happy|pg||
nt|petergill: @DA then @D to jack and king would have been slightly better|pg||
nt|athene: you could lose @H, @C, @D, @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: she did - but East really did play a @D|pg||
pc|c6|nt|paulg:  Macdonald is a very competent declarer ... and needs to be given how aggressively this pair bids games|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lark20: It would seem very strange - but then so does 11 points|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: repeating myself - already mentioned by Marshall...|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|ady: I think it very optimistic to try for a game with south's cards   |pg||
nt|jtr: Big 7IMPs|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: maybe south should make a mild try (2@C-2@D, 2@S) over 1nt if NS were vulnerable|pg||

nt|petergill: England has played very well - one can see why the England pairs were successful in the English Trials|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt is better than 4@S perhaps as that's totally cold on 2-2 spades|pg||
nt|rmb1: The team names may be confusing.  It is common in the home internationals to add a sixth team representing the host NBO.  |pg||
nt|rmb1: This Lady Milne is being played in Manchester (England) so there are two England teams, "England" and "EBU"|pg||
nt|Walddk4: As it is, you can't beat 3NT EW|pg||
nt|ahh: although 4@S was going 2 off|pg||

nt|roswolf: precisely:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Senior gave a sound heart raise which Penfold should have converted to game|pg||

pc|d2|nt|petepunt: 1 off possible|pg||
nt|djneill: West responded with 3 HCP, but playing weak NT, there is safety with light responses - opener will have strength or distribution|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2010January-July/LadyMilne/results.htm  for results and standings after round 4|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: the big bidding issue here is whether south is obliged to cue if it doesn't raise the level of the contract|pg||
nt|rmb1: Next match at 11:50 BST (15 minutes).  Live streaming TV at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/lady-milne-trophy|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@s is easy on a club lead (which should be ducked), harder on a trump lead |pg||
nt|djneill: West reveals the joke?|pg||
nt|jtr: NI have a good potential swing on board 12|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. is north saying "cue a red suit please" or is she saying "cue if you like your hand"|pg||
nt|djneill: ok how does 2N fare here|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@c makes more sense with West's hand|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rmb1: EBU still have a good result on board 12 to score up|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes north just wants to make a mild slam suggestion and other times she only needs to know about a particular control|pg||
nt|petergill: that's Chris Duckworth in the left of the live streaming, for the 20 or 30 viewers|pg||
nt|athene: this sort of problem is why people play "serious 3nt" and things like that|pg||
nt|petepunt: sry always there|pg||
nt|djneill: North is thrown in a few times, one of the downsides of having a strong hand|pg||
nt|jtr: A @d lead givesd an entry to pick up the @cs|pg||
nt|jtr: But North has to give away at least one trick on the opening lead|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|petergill: and her screenmate on her right is Susan Stockdale|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|petergill: Good lead. |pg||
nt|roswolf: both England pairs have played well and deserve their healthly lead|pg||
nt|petergill: And unlike the other table, where East bid hearts, declarer has no clues about the @h layout|pg||
nt|petergill: This could be a good board for the EBU|pg||
nt|petergill: The club cue bid on her left put Nicole Cook off the club lead - she has done well to lead trumps|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see any way declarer can play completely safely for ten tricks on this lead|pg||
nt|athene: for example you might try winning in hand and taking the heart finesse with the idea that even if it loses you can throw two clubs on the hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but this risks ruffs in both red suits so it's hardly 100%|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes this may be a fight but declarer should prevail|pg||
nt|ady: could try a heart finesse while there is K@S entry  but risks a diamond switch and ruff|pg||
nt|petergill: In some variations of the play: at some stage, East needs to put a heart through before the @d's are set up|pg||
nt|athene: similarly you can't just draw all the trumps and attack diamonds because the defence will play a club|pg||
nt|athene: and you are a tempo behind, and may lose @D @D @C @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks to our operator and Beryl and Paul|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: but one down looks normal enough|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D perhaps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahh: south feels she has shown her hand |pg||
nt|roswolf: the scots have bought the contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: they might regret it|pg||
nt|ahh: the 2@C bid was relatively safe as they play 4card Majors |pg||
nt|ahh: and weak NT|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Many thanks to Kath. Great job!|pg||
nt|djneill: on hand 8, in the other room, East just jumped to 3@s with that flat hand over a double|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|heatherd: OK result fro EBU in the closed room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to Heather, Dan, Ian, Warren and Mark|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: North is feeling good here|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Not as good as South|pg||
nt|djneill: North about to feel better|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|djneill: whoa|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: At the risk of using the wrong cliche, this match has been men against boys so far, EBU well worth their lead|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Very disciplined by South to let partner off the hook|pg||
nt|djneill: South will pass 3@d since would have passed 3@c?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: She should pass now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  yes, agreed, a good pass, not easy since partner could easily have just a little more|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 9 will be rather cheap for EBU. 4@H is allowed to make|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|hJ|nt|heatherd: I prefer immediate 3@h. Puts more pressure on the opponents|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
mc|10|nt|warrens:  yes, S would certainly X again over 3@H -p-p|pg||
nt|djneill: West could have ducked the @c to dummy-lock declarer from the @h|pg||
nt|djneill: or the 13th club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks all, back in 35 mins with the last 12 boards|pg||
nt|heatherd: Thanks all|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, but declarer could then cast the heart Q anyway, not many hearts left|pg||

nt|paulg:  hi everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: hi peter|pg||
nt|bg: Hi Peter|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Hi David|pg||
nt|henryb:  That finesse was improvident and unnecessary. As long as hearts were 3-2 declarer could lose no more that 2@s, 1@h, 1@d and 1@c|pg||
nt|ahh: south has another 4441 but this 1 is better |pg||
nt|ahh: in the old days we opened this 2nt |pg||
nt|ahh: but now as p will respond on nothing we dont need to |pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: n/s likely to end in 3NT    may have problems|pg||
nt|roswolf: a bit strong for a WEAKnt|pg||
nt|petepunt: W will open 1@H and how many @S for N ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: both sides will be ok with that hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: better|pg||
nt|henryb:  It was a matchpoint finesse, trying for 140|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Hi Henry|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, unlikely East had 4@hs anyway|pg||
nt|jtr: Played too quickly|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: north's hand is so obviously a 1nt opener, you can forgive the operator :)|pg||
nt|bg: my guess 2 spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ed Jones|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: both pairs seem to be loyal to the weak notrump - of course loyalty is a good thing, however misguided it may be....|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup:)|pg||
nt|bg: wrong|pg||
nt|jtr: The methods i use 2NT is strong|pg||
nt|jtr: But Diane doesnt play that with Ciara i think|pg||
nt|ahh: hi Ed|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi ed|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  surprised that Macdonald did not bid there |pg||
nt|paulg:  although better for her that she kept quiet|pg||
nt|petepunt: we have the best view graph operator in manchester so this will go smoothly :)|pg||
nt|jtr: ugly to bid 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ewj: Hi guys :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb:  Should South raise clubs directly or start with 1@d?|pg||
nt|roswolf: another double|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: now 4@s and they should avoid the slam|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think 1@d is right|pg||
nt|jtr: Or bid 6@c and let them find the lead|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lark20: K asks for count|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2010January-July/LadyMilne/results.htm  for 1st round results|pg||
nt|petepunt: prefer 1@S a the texture of the hand is more defensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: tempting providence!|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this will be a good fight|pg||
nt|ady: K@H ducked  likely start|pg||
nt|rmb1: No reason for East to find the @S lead which will be profitable|pg||
nt|athene: well, if the @HK holds, east will surely play a spade next|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes then a spade switch is likely|pg||
nt|petergill: When East wins @HK, what will East switch to? It's not clear at all, looking at 26 cards. |pg||
nt|ady: spade switch from East would certainly beat the contract|pg||
nt|petergill: A spade is clearer looking at 52 cards than when looking at 26 cards. What if North has A9x in spades?|pg||
nt|ady: even without the spade switch still likely to go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: shit|pg||
nt|roswolf: all this is very normal|pg||
nt|ahh: maybe not the @H opener |pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: yes a spade might be costly but you know north probably hasn't got four so partner has at least four|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: of course east may take a bath - but this is an international match|pg||
nt|ady: only switch to give it is a diamond|pg||
nt|petergill: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath_coup for those who don't understand the bath references|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w play reverse carding?|pg||
nt|athene: a diamond switch would be a bit more appealing if dummy didn't have the @D9, i think|pg||
nt|petergill: Nicole Cook, originally form New Zealand, is giving it a good long look|pg||
nt|rmb1: EW: reverse count on all leads|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes lead pinpointed|pg||
nt|jtr: well South has promised a @h control|pg||
nt|jtr: 8x is sort of not quite one|pg||
nt|jtr: close though:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe S thought 4@d was Redwood for clubs and 4@s showed 0 or three|pg||
nt|jtr: Nah|pg||
nt|jtr: they dont do that|pg||
nt|henryb:  you would know|pg||
nt|jtr: Should:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  there is a strong case for playing that though|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2010January-July/LadyMilne/results.htm  for results and standings after round 3|pg||
nt|jtr: They used to play my system but dont play regularly enough nowadays to remember it all|pg||
nt|mikeirl: direct 6c would be good|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: a very passive switch|pg||
nt|petergill: I like her club switch - it looks safest, looking at 26 cards. |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|jtr: Oh well, who can quarrel with success?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4 teams can still win the event scotland lead by 1 from the ebu|pg||
pc|s5|nt|petergill: but it gives declarer some chance of an eventual endplay, perhaps|pg||
nt|ahh: latest scores Sco 69  EBU (this team ) 68 Eng 66 Ireland 65 so very exciting |pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: passive for the moment  but will again have a problem when in with Q@D|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: the double diamond finesse isn't such a bad choice, in view of the 2@H bid, but it will work very badly here|pg||
nt|roswolf: and england and ireland are only 3 or 4 vps off the pace|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2010January-July/LadyMilne/results.htm  for results and standings after round 4|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|roswolf: staying passive on these hands is often wise - let declarer do the work|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mikeirl: luckly start NI|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: now declarer can get home on and end play|pg||
nt|henryb:  we all can. The Aces in their heyday would have fined N-S for this result|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jtr: How much?|pg||
nt|jtr: worth it for $50|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rmb1: Needed to play @S when in with @DQ|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Fiona will strip the hand then lead a spade to the jack. The alternative line is to play East for @SA|pg||
nt|ady: dont think passive on this hand good enough|pg||
nt|athene: yes, declarer can cash things and strip west's non-spade cards then duck a spade to her|pg||
nt|paulg:  a hand where you will make more tricks in 1NT than a higher contract|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: but there are lots of losing alternatives (such as a diamond finesse)|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 69 playing against 68  and  66 vs 65|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg:  you'd probably finesse the clubs if you were higher|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: still not clear|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer can read West for spade honours after weak jump overcall by East|pg||
nt|athene: north can't get a count on the distribution - east could have another spade in place of the @D10|pg||
nt|petergill: North has to guess who has @SA, in order to make. If East had @SA and thus 11 HCP, she might overcall 1@H, not 2@H, though Cook is opposite a passed hand, so it's not clear. |pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer first has to pick @d's|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: also england play ireland in this last match|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Freat organisation!|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|henryb:  I think $50 for South|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jtr: Per @h?:)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Great even|pg||
pc|hK|pc|dJ|nt|ady: now down|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: should be |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: i think declarer was inclined to put east with the @SQ from her repeated refusal to lead one|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: absolutely - a finely balanced event|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahh: after this board we will have comparisons from other table  they start with bd 1  we started with bd 11 |pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|athene: if she had nothing in spades, or the @SA, a spade switch was more attractive from her hand|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: trying to get her partner in fast for a heart through|pg||
