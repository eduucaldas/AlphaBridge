nt|sybarra: I can find 8   |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2-suits overcalls are recommended for all the time - if you aren't strong enough, opps will play knowing your shape exactly |pg||

nt|mcphee: do not play A@C?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|yuval10: 2@h suppose to be good raise with 8+ points|pg||
nt|sybarra: and E asking for minor |pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|sybarra: needs a @D lead or shift after hts, to beat 3 @S |pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  one more example of BD system|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: This could be regular Stayman|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: And Drijver figuring out how high he should bid|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|imp_jan: good analysis!|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|fabsayc: and 3s singleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ok now for -2 maybe |pg||
nt|yuval10: probably|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: all part of a method developed in sweden called scanian|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: this will depend on the @D guess which I expect E to make correctly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Maybe 3@D instead of X by N would've been more descriptive?|pg||
nt|mcphee: i like dble|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with N hand, @s lead looks better|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mcphee: more ways to win|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  this time, declarer's work is even harder|pg||

nt|sybarra: 3 @H maybe then  to keep it going |pg||
nt|sybarra: can make 6 @D with the right guesses |pg||
nt|yuval10: the 2 pairs from Israel in this tournement will both represent Israel in the upcomming European championship in Ostende, Belgium|pg||
nt|sybarra: would 3 @D be forcing  I am not sure of their system |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree, 5-4 with such reverse - is OK|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|yuval10: along with a 3rd pair, Ilan and Ofir Herbst|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok quanti,  (I should stick with first thought) |pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@S is a trap, as really there is no sound game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: pass is very reasonable , unlucky that it all breaks so well|pg||

nt|Walddk2: He can cash one high heart, but it won't help no matter how the cards lie, so he might as well play another club|pg||

nt|Gerben42: ruff the @C lead and play @H7?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C!|nt|sfoxa:  as an option, yes|pg||

mb|3D|nt|sybarra: *is|pg||
nt|mcphee: a close invite hand for W here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: even 3 @S ia -1|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in spite of 4-0 break, @d slam looks better than @s one from N seat|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: probably a cheerful quiet pass from W |pg||
nt|sybarra: or does S bid again?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: 5@C in S would probably be made, 5@C in N would probably go down, funny things, leads.|pg||
nt|yuval10: hard to pass when your P free-bided with 4@h and you have 20 points. S is also considering the fact his partner is a passed hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: a lot to think about |pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: I agree|pg||
nt|yuval10: his @h suit consist of only 3 cards and has nothing in it, so a lot to consider|pg||
nt|fabsayc: enjoy folks, i am off to bed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Night Martin, thanks :)|pg||

mb|5C|nt|Gerben42: 5@C a control bid, just how N didnt mean RKC|pg||
nt|Gerben42: hope|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: If 2@C is either weak @D or strong, 3@D is probably barrage, right?|pg||

nt|andyv:  with vul, W has to invite|pg||
nt|mcphee: only see 8|pg||
mb|6N|nt|Vugraphzgp: I think the fact that Pachtman had already passed was important in Ginossar's decision to pass 4@H|pg||

nt|Gerben42: 2@C can be weak from Pachtman? the auction suggests otherwise|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  another reason - to "steel" opps 1 level of bidding. N can be reluctant to bid on 2nd level without good @s support|pg||

nt|Gerben42: surely did not block @C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: I didn't see what he played on the @CK, since he held his hand in front of the card, but it does seem strange|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d4|nt|mcphee: gee Andy these guys just do not co-operate with us|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  that's because they know what they are doing:)|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|Vugraphzgp: I lol'd|pg||
nt|mcphee: ahhh damn!!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: I would've played the 9 regardless of what Kotorowicz would've done ;)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bas, are you telling the players what we are recommending?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Depends on how much they pay me :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 9 is probably the better play but I wouldn't have been leading @cs earlier and wouldn't have to worry about this|pg||
nt|andyv:  would have lead @cs:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes Andy|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Gerben42: that wasnt the way to solve @S...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: On bd  9, Ginossar-Pachtman played 6NT+1, where OR played 3NT+4, 11 to Israel|pg||
nt|Gerben42: impressive 6@D was found in both rooms|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Ginossar's straightforward bid of 4@S last board was rewarded with 2 IMPs as OR played 3NT=|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mcphee: now however declarer is safe for 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Gerben42: will eventually duck this|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and got interesting position|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  declarer cashes @c and exites with @s, N returns @h and gets 2 more tricks|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  of course, it's easy to see double dummy, but for that class of players it could be clear in practice too|pg||
nt|Gerben42: it all depends who has the @S3|pg||
nt|Gerben42: also a problem what to return after all he can see that pd wont have enough @D to return them and he doesnt want to cash @DA either promoting the Q|pg||

nt|Vugraphzgp: According to Anton Maas, trainer, it's a 12(.5)-15 range :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|yuval10: @h from N will force declarer|pg||

nt|mcphee: this is not as easy as it apprears|pg||
nt|mcphee: dummy lacks entries to pick up the @D suit I think|pg||

nt|mcphee: that also looks a bit dnagerous|pg||

nt|yuval10: can EW find their way after some heavy interference from NS?|pg||

mb|2C|nt|rhelle: 4@s? 5@s?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm yup from the dutch or the israelis?|pg||
nt|rhelle: Muller|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: now 4NT from E?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@S may be the best bid|pg||
nt|rhelle: East can visualise the @dK and @hAce in the West hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he's willing to commit to slam already |pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm sure he is|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 7@D could have been on, but not today|pg||
nt|roswolf: but 4nt is possible as is a lazy 6@D|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Unless you get a club lead|pg||
nt|rhelle: it's the unfortunate trump break|pg||
nt|rhelle: otherwise you can throw the 3rd @c on the @hK, and ruff out the @cs|pg||
mb|5S|nt|Walddk3: Even if you get a club lead, you may go down. You may play for South to have Qx|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a test of bidding judgment|pg||
nt|roswolf: bid a slam of your choice? says east|pg||
nt|rhelle: I like 5@s - but his partner doesn't know if it's for @cs or @ds yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Zack showing his alert card after tray has been moved to the other side|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point rob|pg||
nt|rhelle: after he opening bid, it's hard to get West to make any noise|pg||
nt|yuval10: W knows now he has a good hand for his partner|pg||
nt|rhelle: so what should he bid? 5NT as forward going, or is it 'pick a minor' ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 6@C would be my choice as west|pg||
nt|yuval10: J@s is waist, but the rest works very well and he also has 5 good @d's that P doesn't know about|pg||
mb|d|nt|rhelle: interesting ... is 6@c not showing better @c support?|pg||
nt|roswolf: does the double have any specific meaning?|pg||
nt|yuval10: over X now it's easier to pass|pg||
nt|yuval10: wait for the ensuing XX from P|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed yuval|pg||
nt|rhelle: I think double is "Lead something else"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: lead @d probably|pg||
nt|rhelle: but gives West an easy pass to show a minimum hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: if they ever bid to @c slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should end in 6@D|pg||
nt|rhelle: and allows East to XX to show 1st round control|pg||
mb|6D|nt|roswolf: FINIS UNLESS N/S TRY THE SAC|pg||
mb|d|an|Look for the save|nt|roswolf: keyboarditis again sorry:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: E came to conclusion that his P can't pass with A@h , Q@c . and the diamonds|pg||
nt|rhelle: Interesting option, trying for a save|pg||
mb|6S|nt|rhelle: now North knows about the @d void|pg||
mb|p!|nt|yuval10: nicely judge by South|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: pass shows 1st round control, interested in 7|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I don't think Barel would have bid any different with @CQ instead of the jack|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think he should|pg||
nt|Walddk3: But now I think he will double|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|rhelle: well ... he knows about partner's void|pg||
nt|Walddk3: He does, but partner does not have @CAKQ|pg||
nt|rhelle: his trumps are as good as can be expected after his pass on 5@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'm not sure if W has already showed his hand here|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Otherwise he would not have settled for 6@D|pg||
nt|yuval10: why can't P has ---- XXXX AQXX  AKQXXX ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: one less @c|pg||
nt|rhelle: or, as seems likely, if partner has the @hK, the 3rd @c can be thrown away|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Then he would redouble 5@SX|pg||
nt|rhelle: I think there is a strong case for 7|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think he should XX here too|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 6@D is not a grand slam ivite. He has other bids available over 5@SX|pg||
nt|Walddk3: And he would redouble with the hand you gave, Yuval|pg||
nt|yuval10: 6@s is not interested to hear anything|pg||
nt|yuval10: 6@d|pg||
nt|yuval10: and i think it's wrong|pg||
nt|rhelle: exactly. My point is that by passing 5@sX he has shown a minimum already|pg||
nt|rhelle: Now he has 3 controls, and extra trump and good offense|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am just glaad i didnt have the problem!|pg||
nt|yuval10: if you can make a grand slam against sub-minimum of 9 points - A@h, K@d , Q@c , how can you bid 6@d ?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I think we agree here. Redouble is more flexible|pg||
nt|Walddk3: or even 5NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5NT probably the best|pg||
nt|yuval10: he can have 6@c perhaps for a solid @c's|pg||
nt|yuval10: you really need some good agreements for those kind of positions|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Barel going through all the oprions Zack had over the double of 5@S and trying to figure out what the percentage bid is|pg||
nt|Walddk3: *options|pg||
nt|rhelle: nice couple of hands to start with :)|pg||
mb|7D|nt|Walddk3: One thing is certain now; if he goes for 7@D, N-S will not "save"|pg||
nt|roswolf: % is clearly double - 7@D is clearly more risky but the reward is higher if right|pg||
mb|7S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Wrong again|pg||
