nt|paulg:  E/W play 5-card majors, strong 1NT, and 2@d is weak with both majors|pg||
nt|simonr: The Scottish pair a 5 card majors annd a strong NT with weak twos in the majors and an Ekrens 2@d (weak - both majors)|pg||
nt|idc: Congratulations to them, and isn't it typical of bridge players to combine a honeymoon with playing in the Lady Milne :)|pg||
nt|simonr: Whoops - a change in Welsh line up. Margaret Lane and Val Kennewell from Swansea|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|idc: I think I prefer 2@s to this 3@c rebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  would you prefer 2NT from North, rather than bid that diamond suit?|pg||
nt|idc: Often partner will think Ax or Kx is good enough in clubs to punt 3NT, and will be disappointed|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  seems like all routes will lead to 3NT|pg||
nt|simonr: Not 3NT by West|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|paulg:  @hJ looks the normal lead|pg||
nt|simonr: I favour 1NT from South but then I don't play Acol anymore.|pg||
nt|paulg:  playing Acol and a weak 1NT i think you have to respond 2@c|pg||
nt|paulg:  it is one of the central tenets of the system|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||

mb|1S!|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|2H|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Not  a deal where you want to be declarer - South might make 3@C if she can stop there|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Last time a match was delayed due to ash was in year 39 AD when the Pompeii cricket team had to cancel after a vulcano erupted|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|cuttysark: We saw Adamson/Symons here in the first half - I rather think this must be one of the wek NT pairs|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|simonr: 3NT here for E/W|pg||
mb|2D|an|x|nt|paulg:  but i think you go down in 3NT on a diamond lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  as you will play for spades to break rather than hearts|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|paulg:  although perhaps you can change tack|pg||
nt|idc: Can duck a @h maybe?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|simonr: No saying you make it - just that is where they will end up.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  yes, ducking a heart at trick 2 is sound technique|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|idc: Have to win @dQ lead with Ace I guess and duck @h straight away|pg||

nt|Walddk4: I see them in profile, but that's not quite enough|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: NS are Veronica Guy and Sam Punch, who had a long lie this morning|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|helene_t:  Jean Hand and Mary Lee from North Wales, they play variable 1NT, multi, two-suited weak 2@h/@s openings, 4-card amjors|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: A diamond lead would probably beat this - the spade gave declarer a tempo, and she can take advantage of the diamond blockage|pg||

nt|cuttysark: hard for Sam to realise that partner's spades were not stronger|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|helene_t:  the bold 3NT bid may have been successful in attracting the spade lead, if she went through 4th suit forcing, N may have infered that W had five spades|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|paulg:  E/w play a form of 5-card stayman, where they respond 2NT or 3@c with a 5-card major|pg||
nt|simonr: An invitational sequence via Stayman to 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|simonr: Looks as if N/S don't play strong 10s|pg||

pc|d7|pc|c3|pc|h5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|simonr: Paul - Dose 2NT show 5 @H and 3@c show @S? |pg||
nt|idc: I read that as "a quack 5 @d tricks" Simon :)|pg||
mc|7|nt|paulg:  no, 2NT shows minimum and 3@c maximum, with another relay for the suit|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d9|nt|cuttysark: A strong 10 - promises a higher honour and a broken sequence with H109 or HJ10 - will make short owrk of this|pg||

pc|d6|nt|helene_t:  do we know about the NS lead style? Jack is standad from KJT but the agreement that the ten shows two honors above is common here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cuttysark: Fortunately for the Welsh the location of the major suit kings means that 2NT was also down|pg||

pc|s4|nt|simonr: Very restrained - would not be the same if North had opened 1@s though. Would she have bid Michaels?|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|paulg:  but I think N/S play the same system in both rooms, so should be the same|pg||
nt|idc: In the other room, North did open 1@s and East michaels'd|pg||
mc|10|nt|simonr: N/S play Acol - many would open the hand with the Major|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I would have expected them to reach 4@S without passing Go - and I see that they have really :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|helene_t:  2@s showing hearts and a minor (michaels cuebid)|pg||
mb|5D|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: More bold bidding by the Welsh East has scored a goal here|pg||

pc|s3|pc|d6|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||

nt|idc: so a big swing for Wales in prospect|pg||
nt|paulg:  or the loss of an imp, somehow|pg||
mb|1D|nt|simonr: Cashed two clubs and then played a @H. Ugh!|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: Guy made 11 tricks in 5@S|pg||
nt|idc: oops, East cashed AK of @c and then switched to a @h away from the King|pg||
mb|3C|nt|idc: Only defence to allow 5@s to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even the bad boards don't cost the Scots anything it seems|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|simonr: Heading towards 4@H here?|pg||
nt|idc: If S bids 3@h then North might pass|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|idc: but I suspect you are more likely to be right Simon|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c9|nt|simonr: Got something right - unfortunately for Wales|pg||
nt|paulg:  surely 3@h is forcing after 3@d|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
nt|paulg:  but as 3@h is not making either no great loss|pg||
nt|idc: Well, if you are sensible and play a good-bad 2NT, then 3@d here shows extras and 3@h is forcing|pg||
pc|cA|nt|paulg:  how does G/B help over 3@c?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|simonr: I think it should be - the question is whether North should have come back in with 3@d as partner is still there is this auction|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|idc: Good question - forgot about 3@c|pg||
nt|simonr: It works well - partner is silenced when you bid 3D|pg||
nt|idc: I guess I'm just showing my age - no one plays anything non-forcing anymore|pg||
nt|simonr: correcting the insufficient bid|pg||
nt|paulg:  to be honest I've given up playing good/bad ... rarely came up and its value was dubious|pg||
mc|8|nt|paulg:  it's rare for Punch/Guy to miss a game that is going down like this, so likely to be flat|pg||

mb|1D|mb|2C|mb|2H|mb|3C|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: The sort of diamond suit you want to bid more than once - but not the sort of hand that justitifes 2 bids|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|c8|nt|helene_t:  Do you understand why S chose 2@h instead of a negative double, Liz? |pg||
nt|cuttysark: She wanted to get the 6-card suit over: if you double, then bid hearts you show a weaker hand - also North may convert to spades with 2-3|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|paulg:  not a nice hand just looking at dummy, but it will work out quite well now|pg||
nt|paulg:  bidding 2@d allows you to compete at a lower level|pg||
