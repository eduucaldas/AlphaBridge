mb|p|nt|rmb1: Hi everyone. Hi Alex. Hi John|pg||

nt|cuttysark: So who are these 'Scots'?|pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: Wales seem to be NS and EW here.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not Grant-Macdonald I can tell you|pg||
nt|rmb1: This is the third round of matches (this match completes tomorrow).  EBU v Northern Ireland.  EBU are the host team to make an even number of teams|pg||
nt|rmb1: NS play weak NT and open four card suits|pg||
nt|ahh: the choice or rebid by east is either 2@S or 2@H  both will have fans |pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|ahh: think screens are used so it will be east thinking |pg||
nt|justin c: quiet partscore here|pg||
nt|justin c: south will drop it opposite a weak NT|pg||

nt|iain sime: I guess Adamson Symons are NS|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bridge_one: We are few but good today :)|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: only|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer can just play on hearts for her seventh trick|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT is not much of a contract, particularly if EW attack the @H suit|pg||

nt|lestergold: I think this will be a common result with these hands as south is pretty standard form a weak 2@h or multi type bid|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d6|nt|xenya: if S opens 2@H, W might double and EW will find the spade fit|pg||

nt|justin c: neither of which would have been too bad on its own, but put together it means a pretty awful game contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|sybarra: welcome bruce |pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: 2@D is at least 9 cards in @Ss and another suit|pg||
nt|rmb1: Also streamed TV at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/lady-milne-trophy - not this table|pg||
nt|ahh: part score   battle here  @H v @S |pg||
mb|3C|nt|rmb1: Latest scores show Scotland 69, EBU 68, England 66, Ireland 65.  Every IMP will count.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: @S an upper hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: some might have opened south hand |pg||

nt|vugraphzhb: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2010/ladymilneteams.html|pg||
nt|justin c: hard to get to @S after this start|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cuttysark: The strong 1NT suggests our pair are Adamson/Symonds|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@H to play opposite the majors|pg||
nt|ahh: but  she  gets in with overcall |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|ahh: hi Peter |pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi Peter|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: je m'etonne que S n'a pas dit 1SA|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@C pass or correct: to play in partner's second suit|pg||
nt|justin c: a natural 2@h would have the same effect - W can only really overcall in @C|pg||
pc|h8|nt|iain sime: Miad Grant and Sheila Macdonald are EW in the open room. Sam doesn't do mornings (if she is given the choice). Hence why I am guessing Sheila Adamson and Ane Symons are NS.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|iain sime: Sorry Maida and Anne mis-typed.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The clue is in the NT range - A/S are the only strong NT pair, Sheila Adamson usually sits North|pg||
nt|bg: Hi all!  1 NT seems like a good spot  N has a tough lead to make|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Slightly surprising that South did not open - she is just back from her honeymoon and might bein optimisitic mood|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|pelu: strange that East gave up - doubble fit and singleton @H?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|iain sime: West would have done better to rise ace. But 3NT could have made anyway- win the third club and rely upon the spade king.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: 6 IMP ca coute assez cher, surtout pour l'equipe qui a besoin des points|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahh: this should go down so no great loss |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@D is a multi with non-constructive weak two M, 2M is natural constructive |pg||
pc|cT|nt|cuttysark: Just the plan Sheila is adopting|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d6|nt|iain sime: Winning the first club would have worked when West ducked. |pg||
nt|cuttysark: The altenative, playing East for @SA and @HK was unlikely to work|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think you can see that she has played @CA Iain :)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|justin c: I think 4@S would make for EW on careful play |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rmb1: I guess the auction in the other room had a similar meaning,  2@S = S + m.  2NT asking for minor.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pelu: only down with 2 @D-losers and 4@S on|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm all sorry I am late |pg||
pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: NS font des coeurs, et alors EW vont marquer 1SA|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: dbl, 2@S, 2@H or pass?|pg||
nt|xenya: will W act?|pg||
nt|lestergold: depends a lot on partnership style|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: courageous|pg||
nt|lestergold: you have only a ten count and partner couldnt bid over 2@d so there are4 risks|pg||
nt|lestergold: and at unfavourable|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|mug: you know partner is going to leave this in, could be very good or very bad|pg||
nt|xenya: protecting partner's trapping pass -- well done i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: however what on earth is south doing here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: very good question|pg||
nt|georgia19: oh dear, S must think this is for rescue....|pg||
nt|lestergold: if partner has a strong hand south shoud be delighted and allow e/w to get into trouble|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|mug: North's redouble was hardly justified, but it certainly wasn't SOS|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i agree can only be misunderstanding but this is logivally absurd|pg||
nt|mug: who bid 2@S?, West or North?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgw: Its NS in 2spades|pg||
nt|Walddk3: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/lady-milne-trophy  for streaming TV. First time on BBO|pg||
nt|vugraphzgw: sorry 2nt|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
nt|mug: crazy stuff|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|georgia19: bizarre to attack such a short suit|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|lestergold: oh dear now south has created two entries for west and has relied on the dimaodns breaking which is suppose is a not totally absurd line|pg||
nt|mug: would have been right if spades had been 5-2 and diamonds not 5-1|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mug: it was the bidding I meant was crazy|pg||
nt|lestergold: south is looking for an 8th triock and is assuming she has seven its not a stupid line at all|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|mug: this was crazy though, she won't see her @DQJ again|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|nt|mug: down three|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: if west had held the club honours she had 'promised' on ths bidding even one of them play on clubs would have llost the race and spades would have become established before clubs ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: it looked too slow|pg||
nt|lestergold: so i do not blame south|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer will get another trick, the @SA|pg||
nt|mug: although 5-1 or 6-0 diamonds was marked on the bidding |pg||
nt|mug: if you trust East's pass over 2@D**|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|pc|c3|nt|lestergold: i agree tom it was very likely but a club honour with west was also 'marked' on th bidding!|pg||

nt|iain sime: NS are Adamson and Symons and they are the Scots at this table.|pg||
nt|iain sime: East West are Lane and Kennewell for Wales. They play standard acol with weak 2 D! H@S!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for kibitz that arn't from ireland and EBU i have take informations about the system played by Gross Brock|pg||
nt|ahh: first blood to Ireland|pg||
nt|justin c: I'm thinking that anything stronger than this would rather open at the one level|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/lady-milne-trophy  for streaming TV. First time on BBO|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|cuttysark: This 2@D is weka with both majors|pg||
nt|cuttysark: and it is quite weka|pg||
nt|bridge_one: it is a classical english acol, 4 cards majors, 2@C GF, 2@d multi, 2@H/@S 8/11 6 cards|pg||
mb|2D|nt|cuttysark: (sorry about the tyoing)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: encheres modeles|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think it is a efective way to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: NS play 15/17, five card majors and weak twos in the majors. Their 2D! opener is weak with at least 5/4 in the majors.|pg||
nt|ahh: 4@S can make on this 1 if N/S dont remove @D ace early |pg||
mb|d|nt|bridge_one: overall in MP competitions|pg||
nt|rmb1: Card say 2@D vulnerable is 4-8, 2M is 9-12.  Intermediate in my book!|pg||
nt|justin c: rosenberg-zia used to play a similar method, only for them 2@H was weak, and 2@D was really weak|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Operator, please delete the    r    in  South's name       Seale|pg||
nt|rmb1: That is 2@D multi on board 2, not 2@D overcall here (board 3)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Thank you|pg||
mb|r|nt|cuttysark: Only 4 obvious losers, but the 4-0 break is awkward|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: hi all|pg||
nt|rmb1: Hi |pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Is East's second Pass to play.  Good partnerships should know.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: would take quite agressive bidding to get 4 since E if not enamoured of spades and @c bid didnt help W hand |pg||
nt|justin c: this pass of 2@DXX is to play|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|justin c: if not, the opps only need to xx and you automatically rescue them|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: on this lead it would make any way|pg||
pc|dK|nt|justin c: would have beaten 2@D, just about|pg||
nt|justin c: @C ruff for W|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bridge_one: 3@S giving 12 of 13 cards :) |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D 4@c 3@S are sure|pg||
nt|toobad: everything lies well for declarer here as long as she draws trump|pg||
nt|rmb1: Everything sitting very favourably for declarer but she may not take full advantage|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: 5 @D? |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1NT is 11/14 |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: you mean for cards in hand |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|bridge_one: 1@d 1@s 2@c = 5+@D 4+@c|pg||
nt|bg: looking at all 4 hands easy to play but many options not easy for E|pg||
nt|bridge_one: guessing it it easy to make the contract - but at the table must think at all events, so hard to play|pg||
nt|toobad: a good recovery|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h2|pg||
nt|justin c: personally, I think West should pass it out in 2@Dxx|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahh: i am sure a few pairs would bid game here  but this Scots pair although very aggressive in certain areas on their game can be quite conservative |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|wilkinsona: well, this defence seems to work ok..|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: I think 2@S asks Brown to bid 2NT, probably denying 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: also six card spades with west not guaranteed it likes like playing a club is almost misere because you expect a second spade to be played before youve established the 8th trick|pg||

nt|lestergold: the big problem is all the diamond losers in west's hand|pg||
nt|georgia19: unkind trumps, kind hearts|pg||

nt|iain sime: We reckon 12-0 and that 3Nt has some potential as well. So this is a good start by Scotland.|pg||
nt|ahh: good flat board |pg||

nt|sybarra: doesnt look like this should go for 1100 |pg||
nt|justin c: i think she was hoping for 2 up when spades were 3-3|pg||
nt|rmb1: East needed to refuse to cover with @H9 while partner had a trump left|pg||
nt|justin c: but seems better to me to cash it out for up 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: I know, operator|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|Walddk4: You need to insert scores on boards 1-4 manually after you should down|pg||

nt|justin c: 5@D is excellent here|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT isnt|pg||
nt|justin c: awkward bid for W|pg||
nt|justin c: maybe 2@D - 2@S|pg||
mb|3D|nt|cuttysark: 2NT presumably a 3-card limit raise|pg||
nt|iain sime: 2NT will be an invitational three card raise. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1NT classic 15/17|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: interesting hand|pg||
nt|ahh: the reason north cant double is it would be take out  so to get a penalty you pass and partner doubles for takeout which you leave in |pg||
nt|pelu: hard work for 9 tricks|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I have a suggestion that 2NT is not limited - just minimum|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: did well to avoid 4 spades it seems..|pg||
nt|justin c: (2@S being a maximum raise here)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|rmb1: Instead 3@D - 5@D ; 5@D is also a maximum raise :)|pg||
nt|justin c: 3@D is a bit pushy when you could be opposite a collectoin of useless @C cards|pg||
nt|justin c: lol|pg||
nt|justin c: yes, this works too|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bridge_one: probably in other room the open was 1@C (playing weak NT) - for this reason i don't like to play weak NT|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pelu: but East will be endplayed when N set up the @Hs|pg||
nt|ahh: i think north would definately have passed if she was non vul and maybe thought 800 was going to be hard to get |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|sybarra: e/w can take first 9 tricks but not easy to sort out |pg||
nt|jbgood: there is a case for a double on the S cards.. but a passed prd was enough to persuade Penfold that pass was the better bid|pg||
pc|c9|nt|cuttysark: Best to lead a shrt suit when you have so many trump - you want to ruff to aovid being emdplayed|pg||
nt|iain sime: Yes, I think West might have expressed an opinion about 4S!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pelu: @C now is best|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rmb1: Science in the other room, 1@H - 1NT - 2@C presumably artificial|pg||

pc|d6|nt|justin c: i bet it was a transfer to @D|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|ahh: even if this makes 11 imps to scotland  10 tricks would save an imp |pg||

pc|dQ|nt|wilkinsona: heart continuation from west was better... for -2..|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West had a 4441 shape|pg||
nt|iain sime: The defence has missed an opportunity to score a small trump here. They may not have done best on the diamond trick either,|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 4@H was -1, Roland|pg||

mb|1S|nt|rmb1: This could be more exciting - there is certainly play for 6@H|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|nt|iain sime: Twelve tricks if you pick up hearts. Five diamonds, a ruff, two aces and four hearts.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: I was about to say that there is nothing on their card about 3M responses to 2NT=minors but I suspect a big wheel has come off|pg||
nt|jbgood: one is playing 2 NT weak in minors - the other is playing 2 NT strong!:)|pg||
nt|toobad: n can taste the blood already|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: i'm not sure W reaslises its for the minors|pg||
nt|toobad: 7s is a cert|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|lark20: After opponents take DA DK|pg||
nt|ahh: this is not as bad as 1 @S |pg||
nt|pelu: close to make|pg||
nt|ahh: any @D ruff costs a natural trump trick |pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I was wondering how you expected anyone to bid it :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: you folk are on 2 different hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: quietly conservative|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: director just being called|pg||
nt|rmb1: In which case 5@C = 3 of 5 key cards.  Has south guessed what is going on?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: before final pass|pg||
nt|jbgood: finally a double - from S even!|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: believe heard something from the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|jbgood: W thinking about a xx|pg||
nt|rmb1: NS don't look like the hands for a vulnerable save, but North thinks otherwise|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cuttysark: 2@D looks like game-forcing checkback|pg||
nt|jbgood: oh - off the hook - amazing|pg||
nt|toobad: ben was just trying to wind us up lol|pg||
pc|h6|nt|justin c: is a big view to take|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cuttysark: Followed by 3@S to show the 6card suit|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|justin c: @HA, @SA, @S ruff|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cuttysark: Playing 5card majors South had alrady shown 5, so 2@H would promise a 6th heart|pg||
nt|iain sime: Yes. South's raise to game in a sequence which invited cue bidding persuaded North that 4S was enough.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bg: now 2 clubs by non passed hand obviously not GF|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bridge_one: this hand is interesting bec 2@C is old natural style (no GF, like 2/1)|pg||
nt|rmb1: Ben: was the double a mistake on your part or was it removed by TD?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|justin c: and now any minor suit ace in south (who bid 1@D3@C) beats 4@H|pg||
nt|justin c: stopped in 3 at the other table|pg||
nt|justin c: that east hand is rather good for a 3@H bid, as was chosen there|pg||
nt|rmb1: Is South covers there is a club ruff, otherwise she loses 3 clubs,  -2 either way|pg||
nt|justin c: y|pg||
nt|rmb1: _If_ South ,,, |pg||
pc|cK|nt|bridge_one: Yes Bruce :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but with passed hand you are sure about the UP limit|pg||
nt|bg: they are using the acol base not 2/1|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, i know|pg||
pc|cA|nt|wilkinsona: does the duck not risk a diamond ruff?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jbgood: no need to do that - we get enough exitement from the real bidding:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: double was misclick|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bridge_one: i told they play 4 cards majors|pg||
nt|bridge_one: natural style|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bridge_one: and i love this way to play (also 2@D multi and 2Maj=costrunctive 8/11)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahh: this should make from here |pg||

pc|c4|pc|s7|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a lot of bidding with east's apparent 15 points but with no aces and stiff K in oppos suits, it was a downgrade in my view|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|nt|lestergold: however no double so no trouble|pg||
pc|d8|pc|cJ|pg||

nt|vugraphzhb: South and west were waiting for East to bid then.|pg||
nt|ahh: modern style with 2 4 card suits playing 4 card majors ios to open the lower |pg||
nt|ahh: the scots approach is more traditional |pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Not sure whether the other table started with 11 & 12 - matches cut to 24 boards because the Irish had to come by ferry - or are just rather slow|pg||
nt|iain sime: The actual score is 24-1, Wales winning their first imp of the event on hand 5.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: did well to catch a ferry I woud say..|pg||
nt|iain sime: Scotland won 12 on hand 4 instead of 11 per the scorecard, and were 11-0 up after two hands.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They did very well - both the Northern Irish and the Ireland team managed to make alternative travel arrangements at short notice|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...usual travel is ryanair and they have packed in to monday|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|sybarra: N didnt bid???|pg||
nt|ahh: that cant be right |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Something's wrong here|pg||
mb|d|nt|jbgood: nice try from E|pg||
nt|jbgood: but a spade ruff kills the slam|pg||
nt|ahh: 1@S 1nt for south |pg||
mb|1D|nt|rmb1: 6@H is delicate, only any good because of @HQJ doubleton|pg||
nt|jbgood: no good lam for sure|pg||
nt|jbgood: slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: weak NT by East|pg||
nt|ahh: thats better |pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|heatherd: Needs the ruff to defeat it|pg||
nt|toobad: w has to drop the j|pg||
nt|justin c: north would like to compete here, but theres nothing very sensible to do|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: Although an immediate limit bid in hearts seems normal|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Why 1@S first?|pg||
nt|ahh: @S lead kills this straight away|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks as if EW have been quite passive here, but they have no game and if either had bid they risk getting too high|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe W gets a secon chance now |pg||
nt|justin c: double would fetch 2@S from S, and 3@C from W|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|ahh: i think  dec needs to guess @H to make this  no reason to though |pg||
nt|pelu: N could't bid 3@H first time = 0-5 and 5 card - but I dont like to gameforce in N|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|bg: EBU now on the board!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this counterplay happen more frequently you can think open Nt with 6 card in minor|pg||
nt|jbgood: E takes charge.. no need to consult prd|pg||
nt|rmb1: In the other room, North opened 1@D which made it much easier for NS to compete to 3@D|pg||
nt|justin c: which they rate to beat|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|iain sime: West should probably have doubled 3H and got their side to an unmakeable 5C.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|cT|nt|pelu: a bad (or not so good) 4@H i both rooms|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and spec who wanted to open 4 hearts may have got doubled here...|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk4: wow, where did she get that from I wonder|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|iain sime: Wales will get their five top tricks now for 50.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d4|pc|cJ|nt|ahh: bridge used to be so easy before conventions   clubs could be bid naturally with support you raised  ah  i long for the old days |pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@C has eight tricks and IMPs for Ireland|pg||
nt|justin c: not sure about the merits of 1@D in 3rd|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hJ|mc|10|nt|justin c: for one thing, a @D lead from S could so easily blow the defence to a major suit contract|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|xenya: i agree Mike but 4@C by W was not an obvious bid either?|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|mug: everyone got a bit carried away (except South)|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: North did well to bid 4@D, 3@H was making|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: i think all bids here were actually reasonable|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|mug: I think I would have been -730|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: west was right to bid  PREEMPTIVE 3@H WITH A WEAK HAND BUT 6 HEARTS|pg||

nt|lestergold: you pass with north'shand Tom really?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mug: maybe|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer can get out for down 1 i think, which looks a normal result|pg||
nt|mug: it would be an "at the table" view|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think ou consider it it might be the winning bid especially at mps but at imps its far too dfangerous|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: partner knows you are marked with a near yarborough but has asked you to bid i think u must bid|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps the fact that South as 20 HCP here including @HQ and you still can't beat 3@H tells you that you should take out the double|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|h4|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|mug: and if partner has less points and a heart void it's usually right to bid|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|lestergold: its verty unlucky that with these high card and trump assets you cant beat 3@h i do agree |pg||
nt|mug: so on reflection I think 4@D is the right action|pg||
mc|9|nt|mug: took @HK and @S10 in dummy to make 3@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes very freak hands|pg||
nt|georgia19: closer now|pg||
nt|lestergold: but wheb i pass these hands they always seem to be lucky makes|pg||
nt|mug: I never pass them really, I just talk about passing them, it's less expensive|pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||

nt|justin c: nothing wrong with opening light in 3rd, just dont think this is the hand for it|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzhb: yes last hand.|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to Alex Roberts, our operator,  great job |pg||
nt|bridge_one: so thx all for watching :) |pg||

nt|justin c: last board of the set|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Very strange result on Board 6 where the Welsh reached 3NT, got a spade lead, and somehow contrived to go down - wonder if it is accurate|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Giorgio and Bruce my co commentators |pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to our specs,  great comments !  I enjoy the humor |pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl with 4@H is obvious|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S would be a invenction|pg||
nt|sybarra: or "other suits"  |pg||
mb|2H|nt|rmb1: Play in this match resumes tomorrow at 10:00BST.|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: Thanks Robin. Hope you have all enjoyed watching|pg||
nt|jbgood: thank you Robin - it has certainly been an enjoyable set :)|pg||
nt|justin c: something wrong with 2@H?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|iain sime: Another ten imps to Scotland. Wales had nine top tricks in 3NT in the other room, but decided to play for overtricks on the premise that our ladies could not possibly find a heart ...|pg||
nt|iain sime: switch!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@C means weak hand long @C - no forcing|pg||
nt|bridge_one: different from 2/1|pg||
nt|ahh: no messing here   spotlight on east |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not particularly scientific, but East is on a guess|pg||
mb|2S|nt|toobad: ditto......... c u all tomorrow|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: some play the rebid of suit,  not forcing also  |pg||
nt|ahh: if she finds the @H lead well done |pg||
nt|sybarra: given the bidding not sure you lead from a K  |pg||
nt|justin c: kibs asking me where south was on the first round|pg||
nt|justin c: i have no idea :)|pg||
nt|justin c: passing 1NT then doubling 2@H is not the way to show a 20 count|pg||
nt|heatherd: I'd put money on it that she doubled on the 1st round also|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jbgood: or perhaps entertaining is the proper adjective..|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think unlikely @H lead |pg||
nt|ahh: i do esp v Ireland |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: direct count (H-L = even)|pg||
nt|bg: s/b down 1 with dia switch maybe 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: the restart time of this match in 16.05|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: this can go off..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...on a black suit switch...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Spade looks best|pg||
nt|rmb1: Thanks to Justin, the operator and the organisers in Manchester and the EBU.  Last 12 boards start at 18:00 in 25 minutes.|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: no she did't 1Nt is forcing|pg||
pc|hK|nt|heatherd: Alright, I lost my money!|pg||
nt|justin c: :)|pg||
nt|justin c: whatever 1NT meant, south should double it|pg||
nt|justin c: there is just no way north will be able to visualise this hand after you pass 1NT|pg||
nt|justin c: wonder what 1@H-2@H would have meant|pg||
pc|hA|nt|heatherd: Nevena made the same lead against 3@d|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: about a 15 min break after it finishes then |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|iain sime: Makes now.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...but friendly continuation is ok for declarer it seems..|pg||
nt|sybarra: or shorter if we take longer on this hand |pg||
nt|bridge_one: declarer can lose 2@s 1@D 1@H 1@C|pg||
nt|ahh: new leader  been exciting  set and well played |pg||
nt|rmb1: ... until you put it down in dummy |pg||
pc|s2|nt|rmb1: The previous board was the first big swing to EBU but they lead 27-14|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|bg: win dia ace lead spade Q N in a spot then|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: That is what my line would be, although if North then has the A@H, then you're in trouble for entries.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Lunch break now. Back in about 1 hour|pg||
nt|pelu: I prefer activ lead against slams - very serdom u give the 12. trick - aND OFTEN U SET UP A TRICK|pg||

pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: Bye for now|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s7|nt|iain sime: West pitched a diamond on the third heart, which saved a mis-guess.|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: director as exposed card|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Most players play that a king lead asks partner to unblock an honour: they would know that North had AJ so would find a switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: club played and diamond exposed|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Compulsory to call the director, though it does not look as if the exposed card will affect the outcome|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cuttysark: Another good board for the Scots, who have great results in both rooms|pg||
nt|iain sime: Another great result for Scotland. |pg||
