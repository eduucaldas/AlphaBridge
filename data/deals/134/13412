mb|1S|nt|athene: many people would double 1@D with that east hand|pg||
nt|athene: sound values and 4-4 in the majors makes up for the missing third club|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|athene: 4@H isn't quite as good as the heart finesse because if north leads a singleton spade you can't get to hand to draw trumps|pg||

mb|1D|nt|garnetts: good morning all|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: I certainly hope so now that they have been selected|pg||
mb|1S|nt|justin c: hi all|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jni33: Scores before last segment: http://www.bridge.dk/4554/Klub1/Turneringer/Resultat637.html|pg||
nt|oleberg: Relay precision is known in most of the world as "Wiking club"|pg||
nt|oleberg: (Where it is known)|pg||
nt|jni33: Bjarnarson-Askgaard need to win with 16 imps to win the "tournament"|pg||
nt|oleberg: Both pairs play the 1@D opening as always unbalanced.|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@S makes here, and it is a reasonably good game, declarer would need oto be lucky in one of the black suits|pg||
nt|justin c: I guess 2@S here for NS|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|3H|nt|oleberg: Which was the dominating method among the top pairs in the European Championship a year or to back|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S is usually the best with the south hand as she is prepared to play in at least 3@H|pg||
nt|jcwla: East with a slightly offshape double (no three-card support for @C's) but deems it important to get in with four of each major.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcwla: The alert suggests there may be good/bad type implications to the free 3@D bid.|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: 3@D is alerted as promising values.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: But not aces, it appears|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Make the @CQ either black ace and this would come home, but although potentially six tricks, S might be expecting a bit bigger hand.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mikeirl: good morning all|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Still, it's a small save against 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: West says "are you sure?" with a grin on her face, having seen dummy.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|justin c: a @C, a @D, 2@h and a trump to lose|pg||
nt|henryb:  But they may not be able to get all of them|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mikeirl: -2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello, hi to all|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, W in the OR chose 3@H over 1@S, which would be fine except that E raised to game.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|garnetts: not an easy hand to start with for EW  --normal contract--better maybe played the other way around might get out for one off|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c4|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3@H seems a touch fruity|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|patricck: West being the overcall more likely to have the singleton spade honour, so start with the A@S from North, but on this layout it is all easy|pg||
pc|d6|nt|henryb:  Hi|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c6|nt|justin c: hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|justin c: @h switch wasnt safe from East's point of view |pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pg||

pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|d9|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|athene: NS only take four spades and the @CA|pg||
nt|athene: the alternative was for NS to play on clubs but then declarer just builds her spade trick and loses two spades and three clubs instead|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s7|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can test hearts for 3-3, falling back on the club to the @CK|pg||
nt|athene: the fourth heart is the sixth trick for the defence but north has no entry to cash it|pg||
nt|athene: this line would lose if south had the fourth heart but that's not likely (and if the @HQ doesn't appear on the @HK, declarer knows it's not the situation)|pg||

nt|oleberg: A true yarl|pg||
nt|mikeirl: perhaps dbl by E over2h is best T/O|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Crivvens has 2 vs, David - let us try for accuracy :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|garnetts: maybe but 2NT did show 15-17--|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: 1@C is 2+|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: E cashed the major aces and then eliminated any problems for N/S by cashing the @CA, so 2 to Scotland.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi David.|pg||
nt|dburn: accuracy in Scottish spelling? I will try, but I do not promise to succeed.|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, better for poker, at least he would have four nines :)|pg||
nt|chick: hi Marshall|pg||
nt|garnetts: an awkward hand for South to bid if North bids 1NT|pg||
nt|mikeirl: dbl is(11-14) :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  ty|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I know many players who would overcall with this South hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: A Yarborough is a hand with no card higher than a nine spot. The term is derived from Lord Yarborough of England, who offered a wager with odds of 1,000 pounds to one against the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: chance of any player having such a holding. The actual chance of any player holding a hand with no card higher than a nine has been mathematically equated to 1,827 to 1|pg||
nt|garnetts: if you think 3@C is a good bid then start with it---not once the opps have got things together|pg||
nt|justin c: 1NT by somebody here|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 3@C is awful in my view --poor suit and defensive values|pg||
mb|2N|nt|oleberg: And a killer in Chinese poker|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think the modern method of playing transfers over short clubs is a serious improvement|pg||
nt|justin c: seems to be very popular lately|pg||
nt|dburn: I know one or two who would pass a weak no trump with that West hand also|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: You may count me as one of the latter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|justin c: the more transfers the better|pg||
pc|sA|nt|oleberg: NS plays "Nilsland", so North's pass required redouble|pg||
nt|jcwla: If you so choose to come in, you would want to be playing something that let you show both black suits at the 2 level.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|mikeirl: 3c  look  like winning  bid|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would not go that far, and I insist on being able to transfer or play the hand with the distribution concealed|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|roswolf: not convinced myself - if opps intervene these methods are very fallible|pg||
nt|dburn: then here's my hand, my old companion, and may neither one of us fall in a canyon|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|garnetts: In what was is it a winning bid?   |pg||
pc|d6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|jni33: ohhh|pg||
nt|oleberg: Doing this, instead of bidding 2@S directly, tells the NT-opener, that he may compete to three, on a suitable hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lars will hate this lead, but the contract is still down|pg||
nt|patricck: Still not good enough. Declarer can lose only one club, but when east comes in A@S and another leaves nowhere to put the 4th @D|pg||
nt|garnetts: Directed NS into a makeable contract |pg||
nt|cuttysark: heart finess and a club to the king and waht was the problem?|pg||
nt|dburn: only that South might take four spades and a club, but maybe that was unlucky|pg||
pc|d2|nt|patricck: *west|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if you don't bid with E hand, what is the good hand after 1NT opps opening?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|justin c: seems to me that transfer replies are a bit double edged|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|justin c: more options for your side, but also more for theirs|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|h5|nt|oleberg: Quite a position from South, to bid 4@S|pg||
nt|henryb:  not covering the @c10 is wrong. suppose partner has 9xxx!|pg||
nt|justin c: particularly where they get to X a 1@H bid that shows @S|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|oleberg: But being behind 16 against very competent opponents, it may be ok|pg||
nt|jni33: Maybe Lars liked the lead ... when he saw dummy he was very happy not being left in 3@h dbl |pg||
nt|patricck: Even if the bidding is invitational from North his hand is not that attractive|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|justin c: where a natural 1@S bid makes things a lot less pleasant|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It's a pity that the second half of this match will be played tomorrow, but I guess we are fortunate that the event has survived the cloud of ash at all|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|jcwla: Here's a case where the @D6 is definitely not the "idle fifth" - a Sabine Auken term.  Wants to keep four @H's and that @C holding.  Still, as declarer always be on the lookout for ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: your opps' first throwaway - so often it is the "idle fifth" card in their long suit and tells you information.  Also, as defenders do not always make that your first pitch, but of ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: course don't sacrifice a potentially important card from a shorter suit.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: At least East has one valuable card, @D9, the Curse of Scotland|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi everyone|pg||
pc|sK|nt|oleberg: No. But NS is also much into making a good system, so there may be something we dont know|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d8|nt|patricck: good play, now West must play A@S @S or it might make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But if anyone can work that out, Lars is the man|pg||
nt|oleberg: West might think declarer fears an overruff|pg||
nt|oleberg: But he is opening his communication for a crossruff|pg||
nt|patricck: West will fear that North's @D are Q9xx |pg||
nt|Walddk2: What can he do if they are?|pg||
nt|patricck: northing I guess, but maybe another @H might be right if partner has J@S|pg||
nt|oleberg: Lars knows that NS are very good, but also very gutsy. And ready to take a position, if they believe in it.|pg||
nt|jni33: Lars has the @h J in hand ... under the table ... noone else than Emil and I can see it|pg||
nt|jni33: "the little details" says Lars|pg||
nt|patricck: North really needs @S KQJxx for the bidding. playing partner to hold 9@D seems better odds than the J@S|pg||
nt|oleberg: not so obvious to me|pg||
nt|jni33: now @c A in hand|pg||
nt|oleberg: Even without the @SJ, the bids seem okay|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Small wishes come true more frequently than big ones|pg||
nt|patricck: Surely A@C can't be right? North bid out his shape|pg||
nt|oleberg: As far as I know, the sequence wasn't invitational|pg||
nt|patricck: South must have thought so because his hand was hardly a gem of a 1NT opener :)|pg||
nt|jni33: Lars asks a lot of questions to Michael|pg||
nt|jni33: "can N have 4@s and 5@d" he askes ... "I have newer seen it" is Michaels response|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jni33: @c A it is|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d9|nt|garnetts: has to play for the spade to be right now--and it is |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East may have considered endplaying North with the fourth heart - but she has not fallen for that one |pg||

nt|chick: probably the operator already starting to claim :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: Emil could see that the 8 was big enough, so he played that. Well done :)|pg||
nt|patricck: Big start for NS, they almost certainly have the 16 imps they need from the 1st two boards, so the winner of the event is in the balance|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2010January-July/LadyMilne/results.htm  for 1st round results|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|oleberg: Slightly off-shape take-out double, but nescesary|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: He has compensating values; double is fine|pg||
nt|chick: I rarely get better shape than that for a takeout|pg||
nt|jni33: I'll try to keep you updated with results from the other three tables later|pg||
nt|patricck: South can diagnose that there is spade shortage opposite and his own spades are rubbish, so he should have bid 5@D|pg||
nt|oleberg: North knows that South has 5 diamonds or more, unless he is marmic|pg||
nt|chick: and non vul opposite vul makes it even more attractive|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: heading to 4@S|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|oleberg: I do not find it obvious that South should have bid 5@D. Other things than thrumphs may defeat games, abd partner may already have taken a position|pg||
nt|patricck: Quite right for North to pass, he doesn't want to sacrifice if South has 4 chunky spades. South is the one who can see how bad his spades are|pg||
nt|oleberg: But surely 5@D would be tempting|pg||
pc|h5|nt|henryb:  I suppose West is a little strong for 2@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: i hope they are not locked into clubs|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|garnetts: There a a few players that would bid 1@H on the North tickets--anyone for that?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  playing for @s ace by E - looks good|pg||
nt|henryb:  This seems like a sensible auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am always nervous when players think so long in a straightforward auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: tends to result in an imaginative call|pg||
nt|henryb:  East is not sure: partner is probably 3=1=5=4 which seems to make the @hK a doubtful value, and a void opposite partner's five card suit is never particularly good|pg||
nt|justin c: sounds right to me|pg||
nt|justin c: @HK may be no use|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: EW have "stolen" North's suits so she'll be happy to defend|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jcwla: Board 2 entered as England making an overtrick in 2NT, but I don't think that's right.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|oleberg: I think I would have sacrificed with the North hand. It seems likely,that the opponents has guessed right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Glad he is not in slam now|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d5|nt|sharkey: Think a trump lead would stand out here|pg||
nt|henryb:  that is not sensible, I think. Partner will tend to play you for a 4 card spade suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm east for me has suggested 5-5 in the blacks|pg||
nt|henryb:  more 4-5 I think, or 4-3-2-4|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: can't east still even 4-4 in the blacks with no @H stop?|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: suppose so but .. i dont think it too likely|pg||
nt|roswolf: spade lead and continuation would have beaten this out of hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  luckily for E-W everything, and I mean everything sits well: @cQ onside, spades  and clubs 3-2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks as if EW can make 3NT here, rather fortunately|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|oleberg: But it is okay for suoth to sell out. They have made the opponents guess, and 4@S could be off, and 6@S could be a winner.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|justin c: can pitch the third @S from W on the @HK on a @S lead|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: mabye trickier if S ducked there|pg||
pc|hT|pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|oleberg: If it was only an eight card fit, a 4-1 break can be a nuisance, even if it is four small|pg||
nt|justin c: scary contract to play|pg||
nt|roswolf: north overuffs the third spade!|pg||
nt|henryb:  does not help, Justin. the @cQ is higher than the J|pg||
nt|justin c: sry, I'm playing this the wrong way around |pg||
nt|justin c: would need to play @D to get rid of @S from East|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think north might have tried the @S lead since it guarantees -1 on the bidding if pard has the trump ace|pg||
nt|henryb:  that is a good point made by the operator. the hand would have been a lot trickier if Lane had ducked the first club|pg||
nt|dburn: might mae four, if their lives depended on it - five hearts, three spades, two aces|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s7|pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|oleberg: Mathias Bruun partners Lars' older brother, Knut.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|cuttysark: Always a bit upsetting to direct a lead and have partner ignore you|pg||

nt|jcwla: Great way to upset pd.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|roswolf: it looks to me that 2@C was not gameforcing since i would have an easy 3@D GF CALL|pg||
nt|mug: yeah, partner clearly doesn't have much when you have 9 HCP, so she probably does at least have a decent suit|pg||
pc|cT|nt|justin c: 3NT needs the @D finesse, in which case you might as well play 6@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: QUITE|pg||
nt|justin c: i dont know their bidding system|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: Geoffrey, however you play 4SF you have a way to show a GF raise with @Ds surely?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is horrible and deserves to lose a game swing|pg||
nt|justin c: was thinking that if 2@C forced to game, then hands that want to agree @S in a forcing way could bid 2@s over 2@D|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
nt|mikeirl: should not have put herself in that predicament|pg||

mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: Spec suggests that North should have bid 3@S over 3@C. That would have made it easier for South|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, declarer could have had @CQx|pg||
nt|oleberg: I know I said 1@D is always unbalanced, but third hand gives libetyes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which looked entirely possible as he got an even count (@C3). Sadly, it was a singleton|pg||
nt|oleberg: And it is highly likely that a diamond will be the best lead from partner|pg||

nt|athene: a bidding competition for NS here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1@H opener, major-suit raise|pg||

mb|3D!|nt|justin c: (and cant reopen)|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: seems too difficult to bid|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not a bad slam here - South has preumably shown a good 4+card raise, so we shall await developments|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: 3@C = 11-14points|pg||
nt|mug: would not dream of mentioning TSP|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: 3@D = shape ask|pg||

nt|oleberg: A minisplinter in 3@C might have done the trick, but...|pg||
nt|garnetts: PASS!!!!!!!!!!!  grrrrrrrrrrrr|pg||
nt|henryb:  East had to lead a @d to beat this, or a high @h and a @d shift|pg||
nt|mug: 4@C presumably shows the singleton|pg||
nt|mug: now I think Stockdale is worth one move with 4@D|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Last Train?|pg||
nt|mug: 4@D whatever it means|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: I'm not entirely sure because West hasn't asked but I assume so; I'd have thought that 3@H shows a club singleton in this auction.|pg||
nt|mug: yes for me too|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: What do you need to double another ace ?|pg||
nt|henryb:  West, I mean|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|patricck: 4@H not really that good a contract anyway even though there are only 3 obvious losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: The description from South is "I think it's a splinter"|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@d looks right - 4NT looks too much, but it will work|pg||
mb|5H|nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps a slight overbid, a lot of second and third round controls needing coverage|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|oleberg: It is not an obvious convention to play, and the hand might not be well suited.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: So would you bid 3@S to show a singleton diamond?|pg||
nt|mug: surely having got to 5@H she bid six?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: pick up 50 vs losing 170?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 4@Sx in the other room on the last board|pg||
nt|henryb:  the 2@h bid can't really have AKA|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Yes, but West did not|pg||
nt|mug: with any luck the 12th trick will arrive on the lead|pg||
pc|c8|nt|oleberg: And the contract cant make on best defence (I hope, since I said it)|pg||
nt|dburn: well, maybe, but a club looks normal|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|sharkey: must admit I wudn't considered 4@H on East's miserable picture collection|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcwla: 6@H = "We're missing one."  More chances to get  12 if W on lead.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|patricck: even with everything breaking 3 rounds of trumps will take it off|pg||
nt|mug: unfortunately that had the effect of removing a losing option|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mikeirl: agree|pg||
nt|henryb:  didn't she make 460? 4@s, 5@c, a @h and a @d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: score agreed as 430|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|mikeirl: East is a strong, aggressive player|pg||
nt|dburn: still, this is a decent slam - perhaps fortuitously; if North had @dQ instead of @sQ it would be close to hopeless, yet the bidding would be the same|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|mug: but I agree, club lead was a good safe lead in principle, declarer's shortage|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I guess they play double as take-out|pg||
mb|4N|nt|idc: partner will often pass it even if it is takeout, and AK twice is decent defence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But if she pulls 5m to 5@H after that, I think she has shown a better hand than a direct 5@H|pg||

nt|justin c: invitational sequences also attract penalty doubles on a bad day|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|oleberg: 1@C = 15-19 bal. or natural|pg||

nt|mug: so perhaps Susan needed to overtake @DK to avoid some obscure squeeze|pg||
nt|mug: but I think they defended pretty well, in practical terms|pg||
nt|dburn: or just the normal variety - declarer ruffs a heart, cashes a club, draws trump and ducks a club to North|pg||
nt|dburn: who has only hearts left, and South is squeezed by @hK|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sharkey: easier from our point of view|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@S or 3NT is easy---with that in mind  in the pass out seat would 2@S not show this hand type?|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree |pg||

nt|justin c: this double looks best to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: south isnt thinking of passing - is she?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I too agree with the Scottish approach|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mug: fairly common kind of guess, what South should do over the double of 4@S|pg||
nt|dburn: not that that double was altogether obvious, facing a passed partner into the bargain|pg||
nt|jcwla: I confess to preferring Symonds' choice of 4NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: they'll end up in one of the makeable games I think|pg||

nt|roswolf: nope|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah|pg||

nt|dburn: well, if I'd bid 4NT and partner bid five hearts, I would give her six|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Our operator obviously has his own views :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: West asking about the double.|pg||
nt|mug: double is really a 5@H bid hoping partner will leave in with some unsuitable dummies|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Why?|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: double = strong nt type hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: 4NT = take out|pg||
nt|dburn: just in case she had a hand too good for an immediate 5@h, which is what I would have for this sequence|pg||
nt|mug: is that what Brown & Stockdale play?|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|sharkey: ouch - trouble|pg||
nt|garnetts: Oh dear |pg||
nt|sharkey: North has an Ace to many for that bid|pg||
nt|justin c: that, anyway, is how you plan to win the post mortem|pg||
mb|p|nt|jni33: Board 10: Has been played twice ... W 3nt making 7 tricks at both tables|pg||
nt|oleberg: The system card doesn't say, but my guess is, that 3@C is slightly invitaional, facing a natural club (11+)|pg||
nt|justin c: if 2@D from N, S would choose @H with equal length, which is not what you want|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|garnetts: you simply cannot miss laydown vulnerable games and expect to win |pg||
nt|mug: I don't think it shows too good for 5@H, just less heart-oriented|pg||
nt|dburn: but I confess, I would not double with those North cards, nor would I bid 5@h over 4@s|pg||
nt|mug: if I'm too good for an immediate 5@H I bid 6@H David|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|henryb:  but S will do that over X also|pg||
nt|mug: it's scary stuff|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The defence against slam would have been more interesting|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Here there is only an overtrick at stake|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, Tom, but you and I belong to the hopelessly old-fashioned school|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chick: There are double dummy ways to make 8 tricks, which would be a very good result at MPs|pg||
nt|oleberg: Og dog.|pg||
nt|oleberg: It has been confirmed, that 3@C was invitaional facing an 11+ club opener.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|jni33: It seems that Board 2 is going to be a loss for Bjarnarson-Askgaard ... two other tables have now played board 2 ... one table 1@h RD making 7 .. other table 4@s DBL making 10|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|Walddk4: Impressive!|pg||
pc|hT|nt|oleberg: 1@H RD 7 must be EW?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Alas, it's only worth 1 IMP|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|justin c: maybe not|pg||
nt|justin c: if 2@D from N could be 4@S5@H |pg||
nt|henryb:  why? except by now you are sure E has the @hK, so you won't take the finesse|pg||
pc|d6|nt|oleberg: No, not really|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|sharkey: no - Vul games shud be bid with more that 37% chance of success at IMPs according science|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|garnetts: The good news is that they gained 12 by keeping low on baord 7--the bad news is they have just given them back |pg||
pc|hK|pc|c3|nt|roswolf: ?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I doubt that|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: S could have xxx @Ss then ruff would be the setting trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: undo|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: this due to the game bonus of 500|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Some action to be expected now|pg||
nt|idc: I suspect well feel similarly about the Dbl William: admiration for the bravery but wouldn't do it ourselves|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Walddk2: 4@C opening if natural|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: 4@H and then East|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She has a good hand, but ....|pg||
nt|athene: yes, not at all easy decision for east here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It is in fact unlucky that partner has @CAQ|pg||
nt|athene: apart from anything, after a 4-level opener you expect bad breaks|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d4|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spec suggesting that they should have bid slam. Sure, with all cards in view and *that* lead|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: I am sure everyone can see that slam can be defeated|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: of course there are west hands where 6 or even 7@D is cold|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: but passing 4@H is fair enough i guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Absolutely|pg||

nt|vugraphzha: Ruling at the EBU table.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk4: Maybe 4@C would not be natural for this N-S pair|pg||
mb|3H|nt|oleberg: If I had to say sorry everytime I lost track, you would ask me to stop spamming|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW can make 4@C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It would|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|garnetts: awkward hand for east to protect with|pg||
nt|sharkey: Shudnt W Dbl?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes, very difficult|pg||
nt|garnetts: only three spades and minimum values makes double very dodgy |pg||
nt|sharkey: Not perfect - but too good to pass?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2010/ccards/SusanAndFiona.pdf|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe, but even if it would I am not sure I would open it|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Cannot complain about a bunch of flat hands in this set.  Hi, Roland.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Why not, David, with only three cards in the majors?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|oleberg: Bjarnarson has a trick up his sleeve again.|pg||
nt|jni33: Board 11: Two tables have played this board ... at both tables E played 3@s ... making 8 tricks at one table and 9 at the other table|pg||
nt|sharkey: Shows that preempts make it difficult|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: 1@S could have longer @Ds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikeirl: i would be shy to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg: 2@H = Usp = A good raise to 2@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: well finis?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They cannot, as a rule, double 4@C for penalties|pg||
nt|dburn: too much defence, too much chance we might make 3NT, that kind of thing|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dburn: but I worry too much|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Will partner play you for such a good hand after 3@C and bid 3NT when it's right?|pg||
nt|mug: he can bid always 4NT to play over 4@C|pg||
nt|mug: it never makes but it shows sophistication|pg||
nt|mug: meanwhile I don't see the problem with 4@H|pg||
nt|mug: win @CQ, ruff a club, play hearts|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: not necessarily, but I cannot get to 3NT over 4@c even when it is cold, and if I open 4@c partner may do the wrong thing if West bids four of a major|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chick: so an opportunity for a good result (one way or the other) here|pg||
nt|garnetts: You need a personal policy here--either you always double or you always pass--more to be said for double if you are vunerable more to gain then|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT would be more fun|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|roswolf: who needs fun|pg||
pc|d4|nt|garnetts: must play a club now |pg||
nt|mikeirl: C?|pg||
nt|jcwla: It only took ten boards but I was right, no overtrick IMP to England in 2NT on bd 2.  Score correct at 13-10.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sharkey: what makes this game so interesting...:)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cuttysark: Tight stuff|pg||
pc|h7|nt|oleberg: A thrumph lead could have forced declarer to guess|pg||
nt|mug: @CA was slightly inaccurate|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|oleberg: But it would have been the heart finesse|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|oleberg: As a club loser can go away on the ace, even if the finesse loses|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|oleberg: And there is really not any reasonable alternative|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf: ?really|pg||

mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: and to BGB and the EBU for allowing us to broadcast|pg||

nt|justin c: a wise man once wrote that the 1NT bidder has @C on this auction|pg||

nt|mug: perhaps a strong heart raise reflected the character of Guy's hand better than 3@D|pg||
mb|d|an|lead directional|mb|3N|nt|justin c: so the partner of the doubler 'should not go there'|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: I believe that would be GF for them|pg||

nt|justin c: assuredly|pg||
nt|roswolf: west is sharpening her axe for 2@S|pg||
nt|justin c: West will deal with 2@S|pg||
nt|justin c: ad idem|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: W giving it some thought what to do|pg||
nt|roswolf: if south has passed west should do likewise in sleep|pg||
nt|mug: now Punch is excited because she thinks she has a fantastic hand for diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzha: S bid 2@S a while ago|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok now double as ethically as possible ie stand on your chair|pg||
nt|justin c: if not X, then - what?|pg||
nt|justin c: nothing else is remotely appealing|pg||
nt|dburn: they play four-card majors?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes|pg||
nt|mug: ah|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2010January-July/LadyMilne/results.htm  for results and standings after round 2|pg||
nt|mug: well I'd expect West to see her advance cue through with 4@D|pg||
nt|mug: the problem is that 5@D goes down |pg||
nt|dburn: I confess that if I were West I would pass 3NT now|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg: or make a 2@C call that doesn't do the hand justice|pg||
nt|roswolf: east should wave the content card|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What is lead directional, Alex?|pg||
nt|dburn: I mean, partner did not have to bid it over the double of 3@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: Asking for a spade lead.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh double of 3@S|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe she feared that removing to diamonds would sound like a slam try - but in that case the cuebid was wrong|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|nt|jcwla: Uh oh, spaghetti-O's.|pg||
nt|mug: Stockdale will lead Brown's suit, even if not vice versa |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|patricck: This might have been a more interesting board with colours reversed|pg||
nt|sharkey: Has to work for 9 tricks I think|pg||
nt|garnetts: There is some contention as to whether 2NT here should show 15-17 if playing a weak no-trump|pg||
nt|roswolf: blood will flow|pg||
pc|s5|nt|justin c: 3NT just went off on the previous board in the other room|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d3|nt|garnetts: Some experts argue that you may need to bid 2NT with say xx KJxx AKJxx  xx|pg||
pc|d4|nt|patricck: N/S vul there is no incentive for NS to push to 5 of a minor|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think it shud David show 15-17 - Dbl of 2@H shows more points than Dbl of 1@H|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cuttysark: Pity to end ona sour note - the bridge in this match has been very good thus far|pg||

pc|d9|nt|garnetts: That is the point Carl--they argue 3NT is the right rebid with the North hand |pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And when partner does not support, she does not have four|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s8|pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
nt|justin c: a pitch on the @C10 is no use to declarer (who has 4@H on the auction)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So the duck was correct everything considered|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Even Vul v not with no big cards.....|pg||
mc|9|nt|garnetts: This is an onging debate with the proponents of the weak notrump--but many have given up the 12-14 notrump anyway|pg||
