nt|ady: this seems a bidable slam|pg||
nt|snorris: another 9 tricks @s contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Leading to 3NT without any entry in your hand, from KQ9xxx low is usually best, from KQ10xxx high (king) is usually best|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Another 3NT for EW ... but NS still have some bidding to do|pg||
nt|bg: another one here where 3 is the limit|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: opportunity for GT here|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzgp: Corrected sorry|pg||
nt|benjent: What do you open with the North hand Peter?|pg||
nt|april7: 1@H 1@S 2NT and then slamtry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 0-4 with 4 spades probably|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: red suits splitting nicely  n/s have 12 tricks in either red suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  will N ever be able to show his @d holding?|pg||
nt|ady: may be difficult to reach|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: key is the quality of east's doubleton spade backing up the 6 card suit|pg||
nt|snorris: should pass ..too many loosers|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, if that's a 3@S bid, North had better be careful |pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: 1@S or 1@D = a matter for each partnership to decide. In the olden days, people used to pass the North cards, but not many exeptrts do that nowadays|pg||
nt|petergill: I open 1@D, unless my partnership style and agreement demands that I open 1@S|pg||
nt|petergill: and you, Ben?|pg||
nt|benjent: I think 1@d for me. With 5@h and a long minor, I like to get the major on the table, but I always feel with @s I'm the boss of the auction |pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT on the West cards is normal. You just hope (expect?) that partner will have the side suits under control, or that there will be a blockage or wrong defence|pg||
nt|benjent: Mostly, I would like to open the one partner has the best fit for, but that's not so easy to arrange :)|pg||
nt|petergill: True|pg||
nt|petergill: The play is very awkward|pg||
nt|benjent: There's was blockage on the last hand, and there's a distinct lack of defensive communication on this hand too|pg||
nt|petergill: @H6 likely to be 4th best, so @H8 will win|pg||
nt|april7: whats wrong with the 2NT bid?|pg||
nt|bg: tough to resist bidding 4;)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|snorris: agree|pg||
nt|snorris: 17hp|pg||
nt|snorris: 18 rather|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I don't think you *must* bid with 10 losers|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|benjent: Declarer can place the key cards right now|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer is planning what to do after that|pg||
nt|andyv:  problem with @d opener in precision.... just too difficult to describe this hand...N could have bid 2@d and then shown @hs|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|cicus: seems like reopening X is taken at full value by E|pg||
nt|joest: 4@h is a tad pushy|pg||
nt|petergill: Entries to dummy are in short supply|pg||
nt|benjent: The @h lead irritatingly takes out his entry to the board|pg||
nt|benjent: Various endplay possibilities ... declarer will spend some time working his way through them|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H seems rushing the auction and does north have to have 5 hearts?|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe 2@h showed 5@h and as long or longer @ds?|pg||
nt|mamos:  artificiality seems to be getting in the way here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: South known to have @HKJ, so North must have @SQ, @CK and @DA for the opening bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  otherwise, bid doesn't make sense (why wouldn't N open 1@h?)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT takes up too much bidding room, Avram. 2@C is more economical in order to explore further|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rhelle: indeed|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: Believe me, Gazzilli is worth learning|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mamos:  this is better than in the OR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Everything Garozzo has been involved in is worth learning|pg||
pc|c3|nt|joest: if I was west and heard partner bid 4@h i'd be disappointed to go down :)|pg||
nt|benjent: Interest @d pitch ... I'd be thinking North is 5053 as a working plan |pg||
pc|c9|nt|cicus: usual procedure is allow some leeway and let doubler do the pushing|pg||
nt|ady: even adfter 2NT re-bid  some difficulty   east could have had a number of other cards and not J@S|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|petergill: North covering with @SQ suggests North has @S9 - with @SQ7xxx North might duck @SJ, in case declarer has 5 spades|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d5|nt|rhelle: conventional wisdowm is to play partner for around 7 points|pg||
nt|mamos:  look like they will bid now|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: When you have the boss suit, you may get a chance to compete later|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|joest: intrafinesse the heart?|pg||
nt|benjent: The @s pitch is ok for East ... now he can cash @s's|pg||
nt|petergill: Good club switch, having worked out that East is 4441|pg||
pc|c6|nt|benjent: Yes, prematurely killed one of East's endplay options (play @cA and another one late in the game)|pg||
nt|benjent: East should cash @hA at his next chance - put the squeeze on a very uncomfortable North|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rhelle: East has even less than that, so he has no reason to bid 4@h, IMHO|pg||
nt|rhelle: oh yes - very nice|pg||
nt|cicus: kibs also suggested this play|pg||
nt|joest: plus the spades lie nicely so he can roll this home|pg||
nt|rhelle: of course, seeing North have AK of D pinpoints the other honours|pg||
nt|joest: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: and N is likely to have 2 hearts rather than 3, so the intrafinesse seems indicated|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm still impressed with the speed at which he found it - not an everyday play|pg||
pc|cK|nt|joest: a play first made famous by Gabriel Chagas in a BOLS bridge tip about 25 years ago|pg||
nt|ady: north opened 1@H CR and later bid diamonds twice|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Note that surnames are not used much in Iceland. However, you can see them in the player profiles|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How would you bid to this excellent slam after a 2NT rebid?|pg||
nt|ady: safest contract is 6NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: EW had the same method available in the other room but stopped short anyway|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d6|pc|h2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h8|nt|rhelle: well done|pg||
nt|rhelle: well, if you bid like that you've got to play very well|pg||
nt|joest: with all three spade honors in the slot it turns out there is no guess|pg||
pc|h4|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C opening and 2NT (jump)rebid are hopeless in a natural system|pg||
nt|mamos:  well i know the value of gazzilli but after 2Nt I'd bid 3@S which for me would be forcing|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in the other room, the challenge of avoiding the tempting 4C trap proved too much for EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Can someone explain where we are in terms of this Trials?  Is it a Senior Trials?  (Paul Lavings is no youngster I know).|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: normal Pass- not allerted|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all specs and co commentators + at least the nice vug operator. Will try to do my best.|pg||
nt|frankaus: can the difence find their 6 winners|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: didn't in open room... |pg||
nt|frankaus: lavings has an excellent reputation for picking up table information |pg||
pc|d6|nt|frankaus: will Krochmalick  cask @HA to see whats doing there?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rodal f: Are W to hook the @H right way?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this is almost a record number of calls to reach a final contract of 1H|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone notice the fantasy in the OR?  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: talk about value for money|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: was commented at table aswell|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: that's a big ask|pg||
nt|frankaus: cashing @HA cant hurt|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugrapha1: North has shown 3 @ss and denied 4 @Hs|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c9|nt|rodal f: So 3NT was the lucky one this time? I don't blame them.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kareno: Comes of opening that collection of tram tickets by west (or at least east not respecting a minimum opening possibility)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kareno: I'm told, state team selection, paul about 63, this is 'open'|pg||

nt|benjent: North could have done a bit better by putting the @dJ on the 10, rather than taking the A|pg||
nt|benjent: snap|pg||
nt|andyv:  would seem to be an easier way to handle this hand|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20 |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It could be a fiver looking for three-card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: East's good play was as is expected of a member of the Iceland National Open Team p|pg||
nt|bg: 3 spades is the correct Bergen call with 4 trumps and a very weak holding N had 5 losers no guarantee that siouth would cover two of them|pg||
mb|1C|nt|cicus: good save found in CR|pg||
nt|cicus: W might easily make a mighty leap here|pg||
nt|ady: e/w may buy the contract in a part score in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not sure I understand the auction in the closed room|pg||
mb|1N|nt|benjent: Could North have figured declarer would have tried @c10 if he had a 2nd @c? Then he might have figured out the 4441|pg||
nt|petergill: NS with 25 HCP cannot make 3Nt but might make an unlikely-to-be-reached 5@D|pg||
nt|ady: 1@D by west shows 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|mamos:  i think West will take control  18-19 opposite good six carder 14 points|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do you want to be in it opposite  xx  in spades?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This was not a random doubleton|pg||
nt|april7: a weak 2 opener by E might have helped to reach a @D sacrifice bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S by West???|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4NT by South??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With all those defensive values|pg||
nt|snorris: very strange...|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|benjent: Harsh that East has both @d honours|pg||
nt|mamos:  North has a slightly heavy 1Nt but when South bids @h ......  |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: South did well to get our for down 1 in 3@S X in CR   must of got a heart lead    quuen of clubs dropped in 1  and got diamond right|pg||
nt|ady: queen of clubs dropped in 2|pg||
nt|snorris: the east in closed room is a member of the parliament(Althingi) Jón Birkir Jónsson|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there seems to be a strange fascination about doing lots of bidding when holding one king|pg||
nt|snorris: he bid 4 @s with good  result|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3D|nt|petergill: With a double stopper in hearts and no singletons not void, visualising that 5@d is better than 3NT (due to the weak @D's)  is almost impossible|pg||
nt|petergill: nor voids, I meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: X = GF, by the way|pg||
nt|petergill: the doubler at the other table got a bit lucky that his partner took all the tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: South bid @c's in his auction, and his partner opened 1@h, so I guess figured the oppos had bid a tight game breaking badly|pg||
nt|ady: this may well go down 1|pg||
nt|april7: played from S only 4 @H so 5@D is enough sacrifice|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: e/w have done well to find their diamond fit   I think a weak 2 by west would have kept east out of the bidding|pg||
nt|april7: on @C lead only 1 down|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: 3@C promised at least 3 cards i think, hence 5@C|pg||
nt|snorris: not that I agree with the bid...far from it|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rhelle: which means that pass over 5@c = I don't want to go on|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h7|nt|joest: how to treat north's double is an interesting partnership questoin|pg||
nt|rhelle: now 2 rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|joest: does it guarantee another call?   obviously north-south play that it doesn't|pg||
nt|rhelle: North X = GF, with no specific bid|pg||
nt|cicus: it created a GF so pass over 5@C was forcing|pg||
nt|rhelle: over 5C pass = forcing. Double would mean: I want to go on|pg||
nt|joest: thats true.  forgot that 1@c was forcing, sorry|pg||
nt|cicus: so they play pass/X inversion|pg||
nt|rhelle: they have reversed the meaning of Pass and X in that situation|pg||
nt|rhelle: indeed :)|pg||
nt|cicus: a relatively new concept, spreading rapidly|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rhelle: Yes, it seems to work very well|pg||
nt|joest: Another Eric Rodwell creation|pg||
nt|april7: only @C lead will do the job|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|april7: X forbids @D???|pg||
nt|mamos:  This is perhaps the downside of 1@S|pg||
nt|april7: oh yes sorry|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rhelle: the trouble is that we see these gadgets on display when operated by very fine players|pg||
nt|rhelle: and then it all looks very easy :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ady: this play may well help east to play a heart to the king rather than the normal play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Iceland is a strong bridge nation. The proudest moment in Icelandic bridge was obviously in 1991 when the team won the World Championships (Bermuda Bowl) in Yokohama, Japan. The ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: only nation with a 100% record: qualified once and won i|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not bad for a nation with around 310,000 inhabitants|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: we will be back|pg||
nt|mamos:  When I watch bridge from Iceland I'm always impressed by the tough standard|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|april7: should not continue @C, but @D,else it would reveal the Q of trumps|pg||
nt|mamos:  east may perhaps have done that with x|pg||
nt|april7: might reaveal|pg||
pc|s3|pc|hT|pg||
nt|april7: W is rhinking wether to ruff and try cashing a @D,|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Magnús wondering if partner could be void in spades (ruffing this trick). Unlikely when he plays the ace|pg||
mc|9|nt|rhelle: looks South needs to woodenly continue @ss|pg||
nt|xenya: now another spade -- and N's @C9 might come into its own|pg||
nt|rhelle: my kind of defence|pg||
nt|rhelle: he know that the @h Ace (if North has it) can't run away|pg||
nt|rhelle: he also knows that North is relatively balanced|pg||
nt|rhelle: my money is on him playing the @sQ next|pg||

nt|bucheister: but if you redouble and then bid a new suit it must be forcing|pg||
nt|othered1: would you sell to 2@S with the west hand, as in OR?  Would you rebid 2@C?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://nswba.com.au/tourn/res.asp?yr=2010&dir=anc/s3&E=0&R=2&T=R  for standings after round 2|pg||

nt|frankaus: pls note the scores snown are indicative only - the result will be scored buy imping V a datum of all tables|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 3S was checkback...checking back if N is deaf|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: rofl|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: tanks and checks EW system card|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe they allow a wide range for that overcall and south felt he had substantial extras?|pg||
nt|othered1: Personally, I like to bid at once preemptively, but pass and come back in wiht good hands in their suit.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|marlowepi: what exactly would those extras be? worst possible shape, bad heart holding, diamond king likely ill-placed...|pg||

nt|snorris: precision 2 @cs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: an interesting result from the other room|pg||
mb|3N|nt|benjent: The CR played 2@h by EAST. East responded 1@h to 1@d, which I guess involved some system|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgp: Who took a long time efore passing|pg||
nt|ady: not  easy to reach 5@D   will likely play 3NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: may get a low heart lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|mdgraham: north takes out a take-out double - very sensible|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  why is S so willing to bail out?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  I guess if they were vul they might make more of an effort|pg||
nt|ady: same auction in CR|pg||
nt|ady: surely worth 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|april7: how did they make 6 in CR? double finesse in @C and @H?|pg||
nt|mamos:  might not be everyones weak NT|pg||
nt|ady: no problems here|pg||
nt|april7: and no @S lead?|pg||
nt|bg: NS currently 2nd in Round Robin EW are 6th|pg||
nt|snorris: this is hard to win|pg||
pc|s5|nt|petergill: Transfer responses to fairly standard 1@C opening|pg||
nt|petergill: if so, 1@S would deny a 4 card major|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: it does|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT min bal, 2@C some form of checkback|pg||
nt|andyv:  they probably play 3@d as GF... so maybe 2N is the best invite they have with this hand|pg||
nt|snorris: thought west would bid 2 @s but no|pg||
nt|bg: more sensible than N in other room|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ady: North would surely bid on with  ace king ace outside a 5 card diamond suit|pg||
nt|ady: south passed  originally so can hardly be game forcing|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|benjent: So the contract and declarer is replicated. How entertaining!|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D might show a minimum, then 2@H = 3 hearts|pg||
pc|d2|nt|joest: well this lead solvesone problem for declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: South's strong diamond holding over East's likely long @d's suggests a trump lead might be best|pg||
nt|andyv:  true....so your 3@d bid seems pretty automatic|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rhelle: this is good bidding|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bg: should prevail with 8 tricks|pg||
mc|9|nt|Walddk2: The two-suited 2@S was no success for the Russians in the closed room, but that does not mean that it is bad. It just led to the wrong contract on this occasion|pg||

nt|petergill: North could have put up @DQ and played a low club, to create a guess, if he knew all 52 cards|pg||
nt|andyv:  of course... but it's a follow up to your comment earlier, Roland... they don't like to play in part scores:)|pg||

mb|1S|nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Icemen love to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: lol!|pg||
nt|joest: east has described his hand quite well|pg||
nt|cicus: he has extras|pg||
nt|rhelle: now Muller will bid 1H, I think|pg||
nt|benjent: Which he would do at that stage with either @cA or @cQ|pg||
nt|snorris: 2 @hs might keep s down to 2 @ss|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: well if Karl now x|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2H|nt|rhelle: ah yes, they have reversed the 1H and 1@s bids|pg||
nt|cicus: hopefuly both of them|pg||
nt|petergill: Put your cursor on bids to see what they mean|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  likely to reach 3NT with their 25 hcp    needs some luck which they get|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N will be no problem to EW once @h suit breaks|pg||
nt|ady: looks like a routine 4@S    need to be careful not to get too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: so 1@s = 4+@h and GF|pg||
nt|joest: north has great hearts but lots of strength in the opponents suits|pg||
nt|joest: diamonds being a psuedo-suit :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Yes both know the correct meaning|pg||
nt|mamos:  I dont understand South's 3@C bid in Or  any help?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I guess one can debate the virtue of that 1@D overcall|pg||
nt|ady: CR played 3NT|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|joest: let's see what Rudakov has in mind.  If 4@d invites a save, he'll defend against 4@h.  But if he then saves himself, I'll wonder why he didn't bid 5@d just now|pg||
nt|cicus: or a round before|pg||
nt|benjent: Spread 4@s here, with some shot at an 11 on a squeeze|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3H|nt|rhelle: Yes, I'm puzzled ... als by 3@s from South. 4@c seems to describe the hand better|pg||
nt|joest: I like 4@c too assuming it doesn't have some meaning we don't know about|pg||
nt|rhelle: true - who knows, maybe 3@s is a transfer to @c|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: I have their system notes in front of me, but this is too detailed |pg||
nt|rhelle: to recap: 1@s showed 4+ @h,and is GF|pg||
nt|joest: now in similar situations do the panelists here play that 4@h is weaker than pass or vice versa?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The good thing about having Muller at the table (other than he is a fine player) is that the operator won't get exhausted because he bids or plays too fast|pg||
nt|rhelle: so the pass over 4@d is 100% forcing and shows extras|pg||
nt|rhelle: actually it's a fine slam if the opps don't cash their aces|pg||
nt|xenya: you may have doubts about thec 1@D overcall, Roland, but you can't deny it has led to an interesting auction|pg||
nt|cicus: I am still of the old school of regarding the immediate bid as weaker|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D = his xxx in spades must be opposite shortage (2 or less cards), so the bid is safer than it might look|pg||
nt|ady: and club suit of course|pg||
nt|april7: true! is 1NT not denying a card @S suit?|pg||
nt|april7: 4card @S suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: think it shows @D and GF|pg||
mb|4D|nt|benjent: I still wouldn't have tried 3@d ... swap the NS @d's|pg||
nt|ady: east wandered in with a collection of jacks and a queen|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@H spades I presume and 1NT denying 3 or 4 spades in a minimum balanced hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: ur right|pg||
nt|mamos:  ty|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: north likely to sign  off with moderate spades|pg||
mb|p|pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|rhelle: 5@d shows 3 aces|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree, Vladimir, very interesting indeed|pg||
nt|joest: i thought that was the new school :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: of the 5|pg||
nt|cicus: I am not that old Jack|pg||
nt|joest: 4NT must have been something other than RKCB if north is thinking it over|pg||
nt|rhelle: I was young before this auction started|pg||
nt|joest: old school = "when I am weak I pass"|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Earlier today it showed extras and a lack of control in a bid suit|pg||
nt|april7: why then E didn't bid 2@H immediately?|pg||
nt|ady: stopped safely   making 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rhelle: the problem for North is that 1@s showed at least 2 controls - i.e. an ace or 2 kings|pg||
nt|tez: it will be hard to bid 3 nt if south would overcall with 1@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  might also be hard for S to explain to teammates -800|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rhelle: and he simply cannot believe that it is 2 kings|pg||
nt|joest: yet partner signed off over Blackwood.  Who to believe?  Muller A or Muller B?|pg||
nt|april7: S can' t possibly guess doubleton K of @S with W|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|snorris: looking like -2 now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|tez: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@h more of a mp bid I think|pg||
nt|tez: i would|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if this 2@C is the same gadget as we saw yesterday, it is (a) a weak two in diamonds (b) weakish both majors (c) various strong hands |pg||
pc|s8|nt|petergill: 5@C as a save would be 500 or 800. East followed the good principle of not bidding (nor doubling 4@C) when you have nothing|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me tell you this. It would have taken my club members less time to avoid a slam off two cashing aces. You really need to be a World Class player to encounter a disaster like ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: this|pg||

mb|2N|nt|mamos:  North chhose to double in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Looks like it, for Italy|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rhelle: I think South has to shorten his trumps as quickly as possible|pg||
nt|rhelle: which is what he is doing|pg||
nt|joest: i think east-west can come to four trump tricks|pg||
nt|joest: plus two sides|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As long as Khven does not crash partner's @HK, but why would he|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, simplest way is for E to  ruff  a @D|pg||
nt|andyv:  much better... N needed to dbl|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that won't exactly paralyse South|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: that lets EAST elope with the small trump, right|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be a 15 imp pick up|pg||
nt|ady: north might well have doubled  with his heart holding  and certainly would have done had he known of sing. jack|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW did well to get away from @hs|pg||
nt|tez: If you has good suit chance of punishment will be less..i wouldnt overcall with this|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: good result by NS in other room may be tied here with W attacking hearts|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|nt|rhelle: ah, the eloping ... shades of Kelsey & Ottlik|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, now it looks more like down to me|pg||
nt|rhelle: now duck a trump?|pg||
nt|joest: will probablly ruff a club to hand|pg||
nt|joest: and make a spade play|pg||
nt|rhelle: he may want to wait with that entry|pg||
nt|joest: a 7 imp gain here via 2@h down one will let Netherlands regain the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like Jack's line. Leave that trump in dummy for the time being|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @CA, ruff a club and a spade up|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: this looks like down 3   and even doubled  would have surprised e/w when they compare that -800 is a nice swing for them|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|tez: I'm talking about the accident in the other room|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone open W hand with other bid than 1@h?|pg||
nt|tez: i mean overcall|pg||
nt|ady: CR 1@H   P  P  Dbl   P    P   re-double  passed out|pg||
nt|april7: the 4@D bid is rather helpful for S! and with this lead or @D K 12 tricks|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
nt|ady: very difficult for south to visualize a slam after a 2@C overcall from north  even taking into consideration the 4@D splinter|pg||
pc|s3|nt|benjent: That's a neat idea. I'm going to steal it instantly :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|joest: i miscalculated the 7 imps sorry|pg||
nt|petergill: If Italy play as a team of five in Ostend, remember that Versace - Sementa and Bocchi - Duboin - Sementa all have partnership experience|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|tez: 9 of @h suit  preferance|pg||
pc|d8|nt|joest: oing the other way|pg||
nt|joest: too early here in the states|pg||
nt|ady: low clu early and west might make 5 tricks|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|joest: now king and ruff a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: J@C now|pg||
nt|tez: or small @c|pg||
nt|tez: same 16 imp to ew|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|benjent: Is there a signal in there somewhere about the makeup of the Italian team next year? Are Bocchi-Duboin being encouraged to re-form?|pg||
nt|petergill: I learnt that idea from Michael Courtney, who never misses out on overcalling 1@S if he can. |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|benjent: Did he explain the idea to you first, or did he just pull it on you at the table?|pg||
nt|april7: but an overcall could be up to 17-18 points|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tez: well down:)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: however the slam does go down with a heart lead with all North's strength|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|april7: in my system|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: But he will only score one more tump|pg||
nt|rhelle: now he has the count ... if @d were 3-3 East would have thrown it|pg||
nt|joest: if he thought @Ds 3-3 he should have cashed one a round ago :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: well yes :|pg||
nt|cicus: he should have done it anyway, ws only way to make|pg||
nt|joest: y|pg||
nt|joest: even though the spot cards suggested otherwise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Funny hand, S and E both want to be shortened in trumps|pg||
nt|joest: however I think that might have led to down 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East will prevail|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes south can't avoid being thrown in|pg||
nt|cicus: S will lead @HQ|pg||
nt|cicus: has to try to pin singleton jack|pg||
nt|cicus: only way to come to 2 more trump tricks|pg||
nt|benjent: Meanwhile, West is very happy he's only in 1@h|pg||

nt|marlowepi: a balancer routinely plays pd for about 8 HCP. W actually owes a card|pg||
nt|kareno: Roth used to say you play pard for a balanced 5-8 hcp after a preempt.|pg||

nt|rodal f: @S + a minor it seems.|pg||
nt|sartaj1: North's logical bid is 3@C as fourth suit forcing to game but there are other reasonable choices too|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bucheister: I do not think that applies to the 3 level, VUL at imps.  If you have a fit you bid more|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|frankaus: you can the brouse tru the boards by selecting next board|pg||
mb|p|nt|bucheister: E might even have a 6 card suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: yuk... 5-1 in a moisian....|pg||
nt|frankaus: this should be intersting|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kareno: So some sort of Drury here.|pg||
nt|bucheister: looks that way|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: some form of checkback, ending in 2@S minimum|pg||
nt|bucheister: probablt DONT at thr other table|pg||
nt|sartaj1: hmm not sure 3@H was a wise move|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|vugrapha1: intersting is one word for it|pg||
nt|sartaj1: In a difficult contract, Peter plays quickly from dummy in case LHO has H10xx which helps him build a club trick for a diamond discard|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: maybe - 200 only ? oh ..|pg||

nt|petergill: I don't know if that influenced Mme Lavazza's thinking|pg||
nt|petergill: for Ostend|pg||
nt|benjent: We're seeing quite a few partscores, but we're seeing some excellent cardplay on them|pg||
nt|snorris: a classic 3 @ds|pg||
nt|snorris: or...?|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: a chance for e-w to make some imps here|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @hs is icecold|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|petergill: He told me after I went minus 800, having balanced, against Fred Gitelman in the Cavendish about 10 years ago|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks seems a lot in CR  for n/s|pg||
nt|andyv:  have to run...ty everyone and enjoy the rest of the match|pg||
nt|ady: ty|pg||
nt|april7: 1@D -1@H X XX 1@S - 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: something went seriously awry in the closed room|pg||
nt|benjent: I think it's often the case that partscores are interesting cardplay hands, because everyone usually has a bit of stuff and lots of flexibility|pg||
nt|ady: n/s play 12-14 nt   hence 1@D|pg||
mb|1D|nt|petergill: 1@D = 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|tez: ty|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: now why isn't this diamonds with 0+?|pg||
nt|rhelle: X = 6-8, takeout|pg||
nt|tez: 3nt has 8 tricks|pg||
nt|tez: if @d lead|pg||
nt|ady: difficult for west to enter with that collection|pg||
nt|ady: has done|pg||
nt|bg: if it goes like other room 3d-4d how many bid 4 hearts?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|snorris: I would ..|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: So Michael assumed you knew the idea, bid accordingly and you had the pleasure of going for the number?|pg||
nt|april7: he is in the laww position with 2@S|pg||
nt|bg: one anyway:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: he has another toy he wanted to show us :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jön gave up in the other room. Not obvious to come in, but partner did not punish him. Páll knws that 4@H might be a stretch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jón|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Even I, resistant to change as I am, have been converted (in 2010) to playing these transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: and you just try telling Iceking what he can and what he cannot|pg||
nt|mamos:  NS have broken the law :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: well done n/s    the 1@D opening enabled them to compete over 2@S  |pg||
pc|c6|nt|rhelle: lead a trump?|pg||
nt|benjent: I play them, playing a version of Fantunes, but I don't think they're a great idea in a natural system|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 1@H is often a balanced minimum with 3 hearts|pg||
nt|petergill: No, I had just bid badly (was I used to do), doubling 2@H on my 4225, and he was the one who went minus 800 in 3@DX|pg||
pc|cA|nt|joest: well here's a big swing back and this time I KNOW it's going to the Netherlands! :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm not so sure ... he really should have led a trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even on that lead declarer is in deep trouble|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, this will teach him not to intervene over a stron @c|pg||
nt|xenya: vulnerable|pg||
nt|joest: I think everyone would intervene over a strong club with THIS hand -- to be fair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Dirk should change his explanation over 1NT as "No place to play" :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: same dilemma as yesterday - if he finesses and it loses, he may never see th @s Ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The one with shape bids|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: can still make even losing a heart ruff as 4th heart will be a discard for a losing club|pg||
nt|april7: on that lead S might go down|pg||
nt|april7: depends how S plays the trump suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: has finger on @D Ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: and a @S|pg||
nt|ady: should go down if playing Ace and another diamond  with a club switch|pg||
nt|april7: ace of @S  @D finesse @H and @H ruff and @C and 4th @H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ragnar stole a couple of aces and kings from partner when he entered|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: as I used to do|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: on heart lead as well can only make 8 in no-trumps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think 4@H is one of those things you have to do |pg||
pc|c5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|benjent: Good way to learn the idea though :)|pg||
nt|april7: critical moment!|pg||
nt|ady: might play king   to rty for heart ruff|pg||
nt|ady: try|pg||
nt|april7: then S makes it, S makes a really good try the way he played it. E knows it also that the 4th @H becomes high so he will stay low|pg||
nt|april7: should|pg||
pc|h6|nt|joest: why heart pitches instead of clubs?|pg||
nt|rhelle: he'll try and ruff @cs in dummy|pg||
pc|hK|nt|joest: hmm|pg||
nt|joest: what chance that will happen?|pg||
nt|rhelle: somewhere between slim and none|pg||
nt|joest: but if lho had the ten ofhearts third you might score a heart trick on power|pg||
nt|xenya: all of them are losers so doesnt really matter it seems|pg||
nt|rhelle: perhaps - you sure he wouldn't be trump short before that @h is established?|pg||
nt|rhelle: I like this better - it forces defenders to play trumps|pg||
nt|joest: I wouldn't mind getting tapped|pg||
nt|joest: if opps hearts are 3-3 I might score another|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm with declarer on this one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A priori a double finesse in spades is the percentage play for one loser, but not after the pre-empt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am sure Ragnar will get it right|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|rhelle: now a low @d?|pg||
nt|joest: y|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bg: I agree you have to get in on a hope sometimes you sleep better when it works|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|tez: natural way play @s and @s|pg||
nt|april7: after such a long thinking a switch is mandatory|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d3|nt|joest: in the meantime the club spots are developing quite nicely for declarer after north understandably rose with the king|pg||
nt|joest: but on another club south rises, puts partner in with the heart ace and its stilldown 3|pg||
nt|rhelle: it's still going to be a bit of a train wreck - close to a swimming pool score|pg||
pc|c9|nt|benjent: So the reason I'm not keen on transfer responses to 1@c in a natural(ish) system is that you hand an extra bid to the opponents, but the gain for your side is marginal|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petergill: Slightly awkward discard for South|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: 15 IMPs and a new leader|pg||
nt|petergill: but East had let a @h go, so OK|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: Give and take. That 1@D overcall before made N-S overbid to a no-play slam, but it has been paid back here|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: and it if doesn't....well, it's only one board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Low club last hope for Sævar|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: will discard |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think it will help, though|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: 3@S on 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: sry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, it's 100% now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ragnar can  actually show is cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: claimed|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|tez: ty magnus:)|pg||
nt|bg: E should play N for spade king S not like to preempt with AK -K|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|ady: as 2@S makes  this will be a push  but n/s had a chance of making this|pg||

nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|april7: nice try and very good defence|pg||
nt|mamos:  great  just shows that you dont need huge hands to have interesting bridge   Board 8 however .........|pg||
nt|april7: and the only lead which made the down possible|pg||
nt|april7: do we have an intermission now?|pg||
nt|ady: only 9 hands   one and a half hours|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: sry|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: smoke, coffee and bathroom|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h3|pc|s7|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: i missed the auction, but this is correct contract|pg||
nt|marlowepi: fancy mthods have their price. a standard pair could buy this for 1N by S +90|pg||
nt|kareno: So the selection for teams is by pairs?  I think we found in the US and Canada that doesn't work as well as selection by teams that want to play together.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sartaj1: South is expecting a 4342 or 4351 shape and so removes 3NT to 4@D|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kareno: As I have often pointed out, the team (in this case team 1) that gets the better of the partscore hands is likely to be the winner.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes it is surprising how many nations still do teams trials by qualifying individual pairs|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: actually is Imps scoring for field of 56 pairs... only 2 tables being broadcast|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but apparently it is still qualifying pairs not teams|pg||
nt|kareno: The top three pairs in the tournament will comprise the team for NSW.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: scoring method does not matter|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW has 2@D and NS now.....|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|sartaj1: Krockmalik's lead is less about getting a heart ruff, than it is about trying to make a safe lead|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: we are talking about the unit of qualification|pg||
nt|kareno: When we won the Canadian Team Trials, it was played in teams of four ONLY players.  Kehela and Murray were added to the winning team.|pg||
nt|kareno: I will always think that was not a good idea, despite the fact that we won the Trials.  No pair should have a bye to the eventual winning team!|pg||

nt|joest: all tied as we head to the final hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the match and our broadcast from the Netherlands. Many thanks to Dirk Clauwens, our terrific operator at the Onstein Catsle. Great job all weekend!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to our excellent commentators, Rob Helle, Jack Oest, Vladimir Ivanov, and Gábor Szöts|pg||
nt|cicus: I think bd 12 (not yet scored) is going to decide in favour of Russia|pg||
nt|joest: thx to you too roland|pg||
nt|xenya: good save in other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Finally, our gratitude to the NBB (Marc van Beijsterveldt) and the sponsor, Hans Melchers, for ensuring that this quality match was brought to BBO. Much appreciated by bridge fans ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: all over the world|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: We were mising board 8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, and here it is|pg||
nt|xenya: same thing might happen here though|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: So for all the people who want to enjoy the lovely scenery may 23rd The Onstein Pinkster Patton|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he had a 100% endplay at that point|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: competition bidding coming up|pg||
mb|5C|mb|5H|nt|joest: 2@d = multi most likely.  A weak two in either major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt that they will take the save|pg||
nt|joest: I agree Roland. the auction will time out differently|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was different in the other room where West passed initially|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry. W opened -- that will make a difference i think|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, West won't bid anymore after having set out his stall|pg||
nt|joest: and East is most definitely not in save mode|pg||
nt|xenya: but E might?|pg||
nt|rhelle: and East is too balanced with too much defence|pg||
nt|joest: if my partner saved in 5@h I would set him up with a psychiatrist :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Muller is missing a bidding card again he starts to order them|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|tez: 2@h enuf for me|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT?|pg||
nt|ady: distribution hand    very good result for GT in CR|pg||
nt|april7: 5@H only 2 down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT may show clubs|pg||
mb|5S|nt|petergill: For intermedaite players: the declarer play technique of that hand was interesting, the diamonds can wait, try the spades first |pg||
nt|april7: bad X in CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: One sensible option 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: e/w might buy it at the 5 level for _ 300|pg||
nt|ady: -300|pg||
nt|bg: hard to figure how EW only made 5 clubs in other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You make slam if you are in it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer played a heart from hand|pg||
nt|snorris: not a bad slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Slightly nervy in 3NT here as you try to diagnose the @d layout|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|joest: so Netherlands would appear to grab victory here on this last board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Play finished in the closed room but no score entered on board 12|pg||
nt|rhelle: this will be quick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Perhaps one of our spectators was there to see?|pg||
nt|cicus: he hides one before each board to leave himself more time to think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S down 3 undoubled I am told|pg||
nt|rhelle: that another 11|pg||
nt|april7: 5@D now|pg||
nt|ady: south has unravelled his hand well as the bidding went|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: Less nervy 2@d|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D is fairly conservative|pg||
nt|benjent: Some marriages wouldn't survive that bid :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S at the other table would have shown 3 hearts and 6+ @d's|pg||
nt|petergill: which is ideal|pg||
nt|mamos:  and West  has shown good judgement|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: So that's 12 IMPs to Russia|pg||
nt|ady: problem with double   is it is unlikely partner can bid 3NT when that is the right contract|pg||
nt|mamos:  wow EW have taken a different approach in this room|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: Maybe 11, right|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: I am told you are rigth Wald|pg||
nt|ady: fell on their feet|pg||
nt|snorris: they are cue bidding..|pg||
nt|snorris: so..|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|petergill: the problem with 11D - 11H - 3@D - 3NT is that you can miss a good 5-3 heart fit (on other layouts)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|h5|nt|april7: good decision by E and S|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H surprising  by East|pg||
nt|april7: the 5@D bid made it happen|pg||
nt|ady: n/s will collect 500 but still lose on the board    |pg||
nt|april7: its the par contract|pg||
pc|h2|nt|benjent: Gazzilli is another pathway to solving these hands|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D - 1@H - 3@D - 3NT I mean|pg||
nt|petergill: East might have underbid to avoid this problem, to leave space to find hearts|pg||
nt|benjent: So 1@d-1@h-2@c if you play it that way (I do), then West does his "ok hand" thing and East can get his hand across|pg||
nt|ady: winning action by e/w was to pass out 5@S    that was difficult|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT by south is a grey area    could be 16 pts   could be what he has   and could be more than what he has|pg||
pc|d8|nt|petergill: Still, AKJ10xxx and an ace will be 8 tricks often, so 2@D on such a suit is not my first choice|pg||
nt|april7: oh yes nobody is vuln.!|pg||
nt|april7: only 1 imp difference|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: And 8 to NL here|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||

nt|mamos:  5 v 6?|pg||
nt|april7: y|pg||
nt|april7: even Qx would be enough but then 5 @S were already to high, it's so close the right decisions to make|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|kareno: 2@h have a special meaning - obviously yes, when west passes showing hearts :)|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, e veryone.  Maybe a defense that begins with a power double would let you take them apart.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i think it showed the 2 of hearts. dangerous system, good thing he wasnt dealt stiff 7|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sartaj1: Even if a @C to the King is not getting ruffed, declarer knows that the defence can negotiated a club ruff later when in with the trump ace|pg||
nt|sartaj1: so he plays diamonds instead hoping to disrupt communications (kind of)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kareno: Ahh, the contract card, yes, very important!|pg||

nt|cicus: apology break|pg||
nt|petergill: Those who play 2@D opening as 18-19 balanced can use 1@D - 1@H - 2NT (no longer needed as natural) as the 3@H and 6@D problem hand|pg||

nt|mdgraham: no half-measures for North|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: My partner and I play 1@D - 1@H - 2@S (or 1@D - 1@S - 3@H - a bit high, not ideal) as 3 card major support and 6+@D|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|benjent: Sure, useful method|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: 4@D looks an overbid to me -- W could be weaker i'm sure|pg||
nt|xenya: *4@S|pg||
nt|rhelle: well, 4 trumps, singleton, 5-card suit ... I like it|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|cicus: my thoughts as well|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C bid - like it or loathe it?|pg||
nt|benjent: choke, cough, splutter|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|petergill: Plus side for 2@C = at fav vul, opponents often try to steal from you by opening light and responding light - so you might have 3NT on|pg||
nt|benjent: I bet North was wishing he'd passed 2@cX out when partner bid 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: yes that is what he said when he put down dummy|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bg: EW continue to narrow the gap 33-23 after this|pg||
pc|c4|nt|joest: 3@h is reasonable or perhaps even 3@c assuming it must be fit showing|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, that's what i meant|pg||
nt|rhelle: vulnerable game, just bid it|pg||
nt|cicus: I would not dare to try 3@C but I like 3@H|pg||
nt|cicus: I like 4@S as well|pg||
nt|april7: With this lead N should go down|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|petergill: Minus side of 2@C = vulnerabiltiy is scary, might go minus 1100, 5332 shape is poor, suit quality falls away (bad pips)|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C response was transfer back to diamonds   showing a weak raise  presumable a 2 diamond immediate support would have been constructive|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|benjent: And the extra values means your 1100 is likely to be against ... a partscore|pg||
nt|petergill: and even on the actual hand, North didn't pass South's Dbl, fearing that South might have a singleton club|pg||
nt|benjent: Even so, how bad could it be? 180?|pg||
nt|petergill: North is very weak, so 380 is possible|pg||
nt|benjent: Even on the dud @sQ lead, 2@c gets carted|pg||
nt|benjent: Ahem. Please prepare for the sermon. If North didn't like his hand enough to keep on bidding it like an opening hand, then he shouldn't have started out with an opening bid|pg||
nt|petergill: South's attack on spades might be an attempt to put the opponents off from attacking spades themselves (on other layouts)|pg||
nt|petergill: Ben's point is very good|pg||
nt|april7: 2@S,2@H and 1 @C|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|benjent: Caught a handy switch too, with the @s play|pg||
nt|petergill: so we give South credit for the good spade play - he knew clubs would not be continued|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|sartaj1: the fifth heart in South's hand is gold and his cards in the minors (partner's shortness) are aces and kings|pg||

mb|p|nt|frankaus: we like it hot in Aus for us if its below 0 C we think its the end of the world |pg||

pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|bucheister: Would anyone balance with the W hand?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if that 2@C can be good strategy vs. 2@S, with all the room it gives opponents.|pg||
nt|othered1: yes.|pg||
nt|sartaj1: Jane as declarer can see that she is due to lose 2 spades and clubs...so needs to play hearts without losing any tricks|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sartaj1: there are two ways of achieving that; Run @H Q playing for bare Jack with East or Cash @H A playing for bare King with West|pg||
nt|frankaus: so play W for stiff @HK or @HJ?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|dT|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm not mad about it.  2@s is space consuming and I like it better, with 2@c for Drury.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|dan_hohor: North has a 7 and 1/2 looser hand and he knows that pa has 4 spades . I would be inclined to bid 4@s straight |pg||
nt|dan_hohor: I would bid a game vulnerable if it is better than 35 % and non vul if it is better than 45% . This one is on a @d guess|pg||

nt|rhelle: as everything has a specialised meaning|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl of 1@D = 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|benjent: yeah, but if North comes down to @hKJ and @cJ10, then the last @s squeezes a little @h out of West and at the end he then knows for sure to drop the @hQ|pg||

nt|rhelle: it's easier over 1@d, as 1@h and 1@s are 6-12 and F1R - offes much more scope for messing around|pg||

nt|april7: yes|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|tez: brb|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead awkward    can take heart finesse and ruff a heart   but cant get back to hand to ruff 2nd heart  and defence can play a 2nd spade|pg||
nt|april7: yes, so why @H lead?|pg||
nt|ady: north bid 2@H  so south led a heart    not abnormal|pg||

pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s6|nt|benjent: hmmm ... I would have thought @dJ was clearly for a @c|pg||
nt|petergill: Why did West bid 2@H instead of 1NT? I don't know. |pg||
nt|petergill: His lack of a @D stopper put him off|pg||
nt|benjent: That would be partner's job :)|pg||
nt|petergill: @DJ was meant to be low - suit pref = don't play spades - but perhaps it was misinterpreted|pg||
nt|benjent: looks like it ... but without @dQ, @dJ is a loopy switch - surely he had some high pip he could have used instead|pg||
nt|petergill: If he can see all 52 cards, he plays @SA then a @D, but .....|pg||

mb|1D|nt|sartaj1: Pass is the mainstream action these days although 1@H or 3@H has some appeal.|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: lavings didn't  think it that difficult|pg||
nt|sartaj1: 2@H is seriously misguided with the other major and the outside void and such a rich hand (playing potential)|pg||

mb|2N|an|lubs|mb|p|nt|kareno: 2@d transfer?|pg||

mb|d|nt|frankaus: sadly often when we ski its over 0C in the day time so the snow  - if there is any is not that good|pg||

nt|frankaus: 25 or 26 zars so would u open 1 ? @H  or @S|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|sartaj1: N/S go past the safety of 3NT but a club contract has plenty of chances (especially on a low spade lead)|pg||

nt|mdgraham: goes out for a beer, perhaps|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|rhelle: a pushy 3rd hand 1NT opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: East did well to double.   Some might pass knowing they were facing a passed hand|pg||

nt|cicus: they were facing 2 passed hands :)|pg||
nt|joest: so that his 2@s bid now would not be a bust|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: After pass pass by de Wij = 4333 Rdbl = 4432 bid = 5|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
mc|12|nt|marlowepi: 4 spades is a big minus, and having the ace of your suit is also bad, as it lowers yr offense to defense ratio below par expectation for a preempt|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|kareno: The entry issue is why he had to take first the club finesse and then float the ten of spades.  |pg||
nt|rodal f: ? From N|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|dan_hohor: without a @D lead |pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|an|min 4cds|mb|p|nt|bucheister: Karen; what form of forcing club are they playing?|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|frankaus: 1@C is big - @D = @H|pg||
