nt|marlowepi: a friendly 3N|pg||
nt|snorris: this is a ok slam but...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder if West took the 4@H bid there as the ace|pg||
nt|snorris: a slam|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: North had a 1@C opener in the other room - quite bold! |pg||
nt|snorris: 6 @ds is resonable|pg||
nt|athene: when south shows a game-forcing spade raise, north will be headed for slam|pg||
nt|snorris: in my methods to strong for 4 @cs|pg||
mb|2N|an|inv+|nt|snorris: south is|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the problem with "invitational or better" raises is you have to mix game and slam auctions|pg||
nt|athene: and the two are really very different|pg||
mb|3D!|an|not min, bal|nt|snorris: 3@ds : singel?|pg||
nt|athene: not only are the evaluation issues often different, but more importantly, when it comes to bidding games you just want to bash them in and not tell anyone much about the hand, but ...|pg||
nt|athene: if there is a slam about, it pays to be more scientific|pg||
nt|athene: north takes the standard route of not treating a singleton ace as a singleton|pg||
nt|snorris: if south can show his singel @c then all is good|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 3@s or 4@s i bet:)|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Most like to keep the weak NT up to strneght in third seat  - more likely to be doubled when partner has already passed|pg||

nt|snorris: drury|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|athene: playing a weak notrump changes a lot of things|pg||

mb|p|nt|tez: yes very bad hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but on this auction i would sure let pd play 1NX with that heart suit in dummy|pg||
nt|athene: like you can't respond 1nt to 1-of-a-suit openers so much|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: same bidding other room up to now |pg||
nt|snorris: tempting for north has the ace...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: in case partner passes with a balanced 15/16 and you miss game|pg||
nt|snorris: a @d lead takes a vital entry|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|snorris: no...|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: good bidding here too|pg||
nt|mdgraham: even so, would be undisciplined to continue with 3NT|pg||

nt|athene: wow, he went for the spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: go for gold|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cuttysark: They played this the other way up in the Closed Room after East opened 1NT - should not make any differnece|pg||
nt|tez: very hard to find 3nt in yhis action|pg||
nt|snorris: sure|pg||
pc|s3|nt|snorris: west has to put on his magic glasses to win this one now|pg||
nt|athene: if you attack spades with that north hand you are basically playing for your partner to have @SJxxx or so, so you want to unblock|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N!|an|nf|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|snorris: 6 @ds can be won..but declerer has to do a lot of right decisions|pg||

mb|p|nt|tez: 2@d |pg||
nt|snorris: let s see|pg||
mb|2S|an|good 3!D bid|nt|cuttysark: Slightly odd auction in the other room - hearts never mentioned|pg||
nt|athene: no need to protect the black kings with a 2nt bid as the ND declaration is already taken|pg||
nt|athene: NT declaration|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: in case any specs haven't seen this before - it's a logical bidding idea which doesn't need any special agreement|pg||
nt|athene: north has denied spades so 2@S has to be artificial and the logical meaning is a strong raise for opener's second suit|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|snorris: and is down in north on a @s lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|snorris: south must have ment 3@ds as forcing though it seems strang|pg||
nt|snorris: strange|pg||
nt|athene: south was perhaps worried about the black suits for notrumps|pg||
pc|c9|nt|tez: hmmm dbl then:)|pg||
nt|athene: but with 15 hcp why not just bid 3nt and let partner make it?|pg||
nt|athene: or go down, whatever he prefers|pg||
nt|snorris: hehe|pg||
nt|snorris: or 2nt if in doubt|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 2nt definitely sounds more forward-going than 3@D|pg||
nt|snorris: which north will raise|pg||

nt|athene: but he did that last hand and missed a game, so maybe not :)|pg||

nt|snorris: according to Björgvin|pg||

nt|snorris: if 3 @s  was natural(in cr) then 4 @s "showed singel/void in @cs|pg||
mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: not worth more than 3@D here, club queen not worth much|pg||

nt|athene: 4@H? really? i was expecting 4@D there from north, with 3@H a very faint possibility|pg||

nt|snorris: now some Lebensohl?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|cuttysark: North led his club and got a ruff with his trump trick - as usual, this line of defence let the contract through|pg||

pc|d7|nt|cuttysark: Can't see any way to make this one|pg||

nt|athene: north is likely to underlead the @CA now i guess|pg||
nt|athene: that's the sort of thing you do|pg||
nt|athene: there is a ruffing finesse set up now in diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: so declarer has enough tricks if he picks things well|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: now  a D|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|snorris: now a "safe" play in @ss :)|pg||

pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: Karl is allowed to take his time and plan the defence even if there is a singleton in dummy and declarer has asked for it without hesitation|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S played quickly to first trick. might have asked about meaning of crad at trick onme|pg||

nt|snorris: so younever lead from it..?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: all the time :(|pg||
nt|snorris: hehe|pg||
nt|athene: you might perhaps argue that north would be more likely to lead a club from the ace there, than from the queen|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Nothing unethical about that as one spec suggests|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's declarer's duty to pause for a while even if he has his game plan ready|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he does not, the defencer can do it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the awkward thing here is that South is discarding his long suit, where he can establish tricks if he gets in|pg||
nt|snorris: seems to hope for 2 @s tricks and a @d finesse|pg||
nt|athene: with the jack in dummy|pg||
nt|athene: leading a club from Qxxx could give a trick whereas Axxx is less likely to|pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: will play on crossruff lines and likely make that way|pg||
nt|athene: but a club switch was so likely anyway, it was tough|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  may have confused the times a defender pauses and then plays a card in suit which later turns out to be a singleton.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: W can count only 4 tricks for defense, so once club is ducked he should play E for D ten (or any 5 diamonds)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps east decided south might have led a club at trick 1 from Qxx(x) but not from Axx(x) - plus of course if the queen is onside you do have an extra trick in clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now may fail since diamonds establish, so tempted to take spade finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however no trump lead may be a clue|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he simply cant handle hand if north has only 2 diamonds|pg||

nt|andyv:  right:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would you open the East hand in 3rd seat? I would I must confess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good defensive problem, W will be kicking himself (unless E beats him to it:))|pg||
nt|snorris: new leaders now|pg||
nt|snorris: will he open this west?|pg||
nt|snorris: think so...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok prove me wrong, this line was for down one|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Jón did not in the other room|pg||
nt|andyv:  of course...it's got extras|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sure - I have spades|pg||

nt|snorris: amazing..|pg||
mb|4D|nt|snorris: double would show @s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, south thought "they lead a diamond, and pd wins the ace and runs seven clubs and five hearts"|pg||
nt|snorris: Aron seems to be going somewhere..|pg||
mb|4H|nt|snorris: ah..1@h IS @ss|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|tez: only problem with this convention is that opp might dbl for lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe not a mainstream takeout double, but it made N-S go overboard|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S is obviously t/o of spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: May as well be in 3NT as 3@C with this North hand|pg||
nt|snorris: yes|pg||
nt|athene: in fact 6@C was an underbid on that logic :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: And JS on the board at long last|pg||
nt|snorris: thats a shaky contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here we go, south has lots in reserve|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  EW can gain a couple of imps here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here you see that Sævar takes his time although there is a singleton in dummy|pg||
nt|athene: some people play after nebulous 1@C - 1red transfer response, that X = @C+other major and cue = @D+other major|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D just choice of games, not promising huge amounts of high card strength|pg||
nt|athene: with a decent hand and  5cards in one major north would just bid game in that major|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think you can really handle 4@D cue bid with aron's hand|pg||
nt|athene: so this auction tends to suggest both majors or 4major and longer minor|pg||
nt|snorris: no|pg||
nt|snorris: or yes |pg||
nt|snorris: it seems to be norths intention|pg||
nt|athene: current opinion tends to be you devote most of your effort to reaching the right game after a pre-empt|pg||
nt|snorris: to show clubs on the side|pg||
nt|athene: south could have bid 3nt over 3@D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the right game is 4@C :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: but i think the norm is for cue to be general t/o and double to show the transfer suit|pg||
nt|snorris: very agressive west after a pass first time|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this double is very aggressive, having make a t/o overcall of 1@S - partner has passed twice|pg||
nt|athene: well, he knows he is "protected" by his passed-hand status|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. no matter how often he jumps up and down thereafter he can't have more than about a ten count|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: That is normal procedure|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: you might get into 6@S here|pg||

nt|mdgraham: a lot of slams....|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|tez: 3@h or 2@d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: or 2 @C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H  1@S  ;  3@H   4@H  seems normal, maybe even an immediate 4@H by West|pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|athene: ten tricks in spades in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: that seems like a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I lie that explanation: 2@c had 'all sorts of meaning' one presumably c20 balanced|pg||
nt|athene: if he learns that east has 5-1-4-3 shape with two aces, the @CA is more likely than the @HA|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: thats far to much..|pg||
nt|snorris: @c lead?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|snorris: 4@cs dening @h cue is good news for east|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm - no 4@H from East|pg||
nt|athene: do we know the meaning of 3@D? could be a random non-minimum |pg||
pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: the go-slow "gizmo" auction has good chance of catching 3N or 4S when they are right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is this Gazzilli-like? West showing 16-17+ with hearts and diamonds now? 2@D 8+ hcp?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|snorris: or just natural?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: this is a getsilly contract though|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: i guess in practice this is less than 50%|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: you are going down if north has the @CA or if south has a singleton club and leads it|pg||
pc|h6|nt|snorris: yeah...probably|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1 key or 1 ace?|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose you might be able to get an elimination and make when north has singleton @CA|pg||
nt|snorris: jack 10 in south helps|pg||
nt|athene: (strip the red suits and lead club to @CK, get ruff/discard)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Moer promising singleton lead with 3 small trump, but declarer can make this.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess partner could have dream values for slams even though he is a passed hand, but I think you should forget about it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it takes top experts with cutting-edge technology to wind up in 5D on these cards|pg||
nt|tez: is this 4@h cue or a preference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As we all know, partners never have what we want them to have anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the heart ruff actually hurts the defense|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  beside the pass out, our first part score in OR|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Generally a sound strategy, Roland|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|cuttysark: True - but it looks a big position to take.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@H=spades|pg||
nt|athene: well the diamonds come in quite nicely|pg||
nt|snorris: no way to avoid 3 nt here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|cuttysark: 6@D looks a posibility on this board|pg||
nt|athene: normally you try either a double finesse or ace and another, either of which will work a treat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer in the closed room played for the wrong hand to have a singleton diamond honour|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: started with @DQ from dummy?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hoping for East to have the singleton jack|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|athene: i mean @DQ from south hand?|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that does not fit this bidding to play east for singleton|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  4@c now?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|andyv:  N's bidding a bit sterile|pg||
nt|fabsayc: opening 1@C has lost the diamond fit again|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  3N certainly safe as cards lie|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sævar can't know that Karl has all those controls, so 4@D now is not clear at all in my view|pg||
nt|snorris: well...|pg||
nt|snorris: I have to take it all back.. it could be avoided|pg||
pc|sT|nt|snorris: s is looking for a 1s support with 3 @cs|pg||

pc|s2|nt|andyv:  finally the support comes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did it anyway|pg||
nt|mdgraham: with the marked diamond posiiton, this has chances |pg||

pc|sA|nt|snorris: feks|pg||
nt|snorris: but no north has to fight for it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South's 1@H shows spades - he would double 1@D to show hearts|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all avoidable with the right opening bid :)|pg||
nt|snorris: ah... 1 @d ?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|andyv:  that's why I think N whould have given a raise over 3@d (that's why I like 4@c)|pg||

nt|cuttysark: it just remains to make it. Muat play to establish hearts|pg||
nt|andyv:  and S didn't bid 4@h after N showed a 7 card suit|pg||
nt|snorris: still north has to find out|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  in CR, auction went 1@h 2@d and now N jumped to 4@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You would not want to ruff two clubs as the alternative line. Then you need @DJ to drop|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The heart suit gives better odds|pg||
pc|c5|pg||

nt|vugraphzhn: sry|pg||
nt|athene: hello good evening everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I am happy to see Sævar in action. He was my partner when he lived in Denmark. Fine player, nice guy. Give him by best Björgvin, please|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|vugraphzhn: done|pg||
nt|Walddk2: thx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: slam could be stolen here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even a grand:)|pg||
nt|snorris: hi|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt rebid here shows a solid suit with some outside cards (not strong balanced)|pg||
nt|athene: so east will be passing, i imagine, rather than bidding hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzhn: rehi|pg||
nt|snorris: rehi|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: sorry about this delay|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hi Bjorgvin|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rather attenuated 1@C opener|pg||
nt|snorris: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: well Erlendur is an agressive bidder|pg||
nt|snorris: a @h fit missed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not a hand I would associate with a 3NT rebid, but they play what they like obviously|pg||
nt|snorris: he has a good hand oposite a running @cs|pg||
nt|athene: slam is possible in hearts or clubs but it's unlikely they will get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Running scores and standings at   http://www.bridge.is/results/|pg||
nt|athene: ok, very unlikely now :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: i might open west 2@C but if you open 1@C you don't really have a rebid other than 3nt|pg||
nt|snorris: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: how about 2 @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can reverse into 2@D|pg||
pc|d7|nt|snorris: but then nþs would probably play easy 2 @s|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: you can try something cute in diamonds or spades, but if you have to resort to that, it's nature's way of telling you to open 2@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's what I would do|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: we should play sometime then|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzhn: EW play 15-17 standard |pg||
nt|cuttysark: This wold be easy if the spade finesse worked. As it is, he needs to do something clever in diamonds|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Like persuade a defender tp lead the suit :)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Definitely|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|h2|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: South's hand is very flat, but 2@S worth considering with Kxx in support|pg||
pc|h8|nt|cuttysark: Oh well|pg||
nt|snorris: n-s|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: By the way, 2@D as a reverse should be a catch-all; doesn't necessarily show diamonds|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: however this is an accurate defence |pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|snorris: so -1 it is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Could also be a hand too good for a 3@C rebid with or without 3 hearts|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d6|pc|h7|pc|s6|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|h9|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|athene: yes, but if you are going to do that, you should just define 2@D there as artificial and play some methods over it|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|snorris: best to play strong @c system on these ones|pg||
pc|s7|pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||

nt|snorris: 5 @c e-w|pg||
nt|athene: i believe garozzo does that and he has a lot of system there|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Exactly Bill|pg||
nt|athene: what i don't like is the "bridge world standard" idea of faking reverses and jump shifts on 3-card suits all the time, but insisting they are "natural"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are not and should be alerted|pg||
nt|athene: it just means you can't bid real 2-suiters easily if partner can't trust your natural bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I expect this is some sort of pre-empt...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Thank you - a good pre-empt in either major. Slam still tough to bid|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East needs to find out about the singleton diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|cuttysark: over a Multi many play that 4@C says - 'transfer into your major' and 4! says 'bid your major'|pg||
nt|snorris: even 3 nt|pg||
nt|athene: ok, polemic over :)|pg||
nt|athene: next hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, the 2@D reverse may contain diamonds|pg||
mb|2C|nt|tez: dbl shows @s's..2nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 2H about as high as NS want to go|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Responder will ask for clarification after 1@C  1@H  ;  2@D    and   1@C  1@S  ;  2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: useful to play these transfers in competitive auctions (as longa s you remember them)|pg||
nt|snorris: n-s have a good sacrifice in 4 @ds|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: though with super friendly layout a game could make|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: And they do the same over their unusual Multi 3@D|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East sees no reason for the lead to come up to his hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as they give more options: South can show diamonds first, and then support hearts (not here, of course)|pg||
nt|snorris: and 5 @ds|pg||
nt|snorris: on 5@cs|pg||
mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: perhaps 2N by S would have been a heart raise. otherwise it looks like the obvious value call|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tez: I was afraid of 4@s bid(N)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when E does not neg X, spades are probably not a fatal concern|pg||
nt|snorris: yes west IS agressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not sure why W is thinking. NV opps unlikely to fail by more than one|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: told you so|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this contract appears to have a slight flaw|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All very sensible this|pg||
