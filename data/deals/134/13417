nt|cuttysark: Seat rage? That's a new one|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: They're contemplating how they should have started five minutes ago now.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Shame the schedule had to be altered because of volcanic ash - I am sure there will be some leeway asked and give|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: Hello all,]|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not any more :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bg: Good afternoon all|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rmb1: hi.  Welcome to day two of the Lady Milne and the second half of EBU v Northern Ireland|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Bruce Gowdy and David Gold|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w might get carried away|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi robin|pg||
mb|2D|nt|dagold: Hi all|pg||
nt|garnetts: Probably after that very agressive neg dbl |pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk7: You have been coaching E-W on BBO for a while now, isn't that correct, David?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Not  a deal where you want to be declarer - South might make 3@C if she can stop there|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Last time a match was delayed due to ash was in year 39 AD when the Pompeii cricket team had to cancel after a vulcano erupted|pg||
nt|dagold: double looks to be conventional|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps 4M/5+m|pg||
nt|roswolf: east really did push the boat out even bearing the vul in mind|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: no|pg||
nt|bg: wow looks like NS came to bid!|pg||
nt|dagold: I coached Jagger-Seale|pg||
nt|Walddk7: oh right|pg||
nt|dagold: Simon Cope coached Gross-Brock mostly|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: Cope coaches them.|pg||
nt|roswolf: the brakes are applied|pg||
nt|garnetts: South gave in too easily in my view|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: yup maybe it is raining in manchester|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cuttysark: We saw Adamson/Symons here in the first half - I rather think this must be one of the wek NT pairs|pg||
nt|toobad: good morning all|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi john|pg||
nt|garnetts: 9/10 tricks coming up--quite  likely that South will duck a heart lead |pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk7: Good afternoon to Alan Shillitoe|pg||
nt|the saint: Afternoon all|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: the double wasn't alerted, just the 2@C|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|dagold: Gross has played her partner to be very light|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dagold: so double musty have been conventional|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
nt|dagold: I am sure it is|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|cuttysark: Simple line would work if spades were 3-3, or @DA was onside|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|dagold: but a good game albeit light on high cards has been missed at both tables...|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d9|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|cT|nt|cuttysark: or there was a misdefence|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Helene Thygesen|pg||
nt|helene_t:  thanks Roland|pg||
nt|dagold: Seale and Jagger have reached 5@d in the match against Wales|pg||
nt|roswolf: an early gain for the irish|pg||
mb|1H|nt|garnetts: The heart slam makes because the clubs are well placed |pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|Walddk4: Operator, could we please have player names up?|pg||
nt|roswolf: early morning bidding test|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S TO MIX IT UP?|pg||
nt|garnetts: always difficult for for a player to give up on a slam with 19 facing an opening bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: reasonable try at green Geoffrey|pg||
nt|rmb1: Tempting for West to pot 6NT early and see what the chances are when dummy comes down|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|garnetts: I was thinking that myself --might have been the case if North had tried 3@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhb: Yes sorry, forgot|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I see them in profile, but that's not quite enough|pg||
nt|the saint: It will be easier to reach over a club opening as that will help highlight the lack of wastage - strong NT made things more ambiguous|pg||
nt|dagold: 4@h needs to be played by west|pg||
nt|dagold: but I doubt it will be|pg||
nt|dagold: P-P now 3@h from east|pg||
nt|the saint: If Gross is thinking about bidding, it can only be X I presume|pg||
nt|dagold: I think so but I think pass is clear|pg||
nt|bg: what would a 2d cue bid have nmeant from E instead of 1 S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|roswolf: east didnt like her hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: hmmmmmm   well West must have a really poor opinion of her partner's openings at red|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cuttysark: NS are Veronica Guy and Sam Punch, who had a long lie this morning|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dagold: a good raise in England Bruce|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: She wasn't thinking, I just missed the double before it went through.|pg||
nt|dagold: double was a large overbid with KJ of diamonds and not 3@s|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|helene_t:  Jean Hand and Mary Lee from North Wales, they play variable 1NT, multi, two-suited weak 2@h/@s openings, 4-card amjors|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dagold: disaster!|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|cuttysark: A diamond lead would probably beat this - the spade gave declarer a tempo, and she can take advantage of the diamond blockage|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rmb1: 6@H needs diamonds 3-3 or C!Q with North, so well with the odds|pg||
pc|s4|pc|hT|nt|dagold: so more imps for ireland it seems as this is an easy 500|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|nt|cuttysark: hard for Sam to realise that partner's spades were not stronger|pg||
pc|c3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|helene_t:  the bold 3NT bid may have been successful in attracting the spade lead, if she went through 4th suit forcing, N may have infered that W had five spades|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|dagold: West was at fault there|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|rmb1: Playing instead for the minor suit squeeze|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|pg||
mc|11|nt|toobad: that is impossible|pg||

nt|rmb1: @D7 was good if South discarded a diamond|pg||
nt|garnetts: almost certainly did not |pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: at that stage in the hand 12 tricks were cold|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Scotland picked up on the first board where Veronica Guy made 3NT |pg||
nt|bg: maybe a double of 1 dia would have been best for EW|pg||
nt|garnetts: simple misclick |pg||
nt|garnetts: I thought the @D discard unlikely |pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|dagold: yes maybe|pg||
nt|dagold: but 1@s is hardly unreasonable|pg||
nt|dagold: interesting 1@s|pg||
nt|toobad: south discarded a d to guard clubs|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: east  starts the ball rolling|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@D is a bergen raise|pg||
nt|garnetts: unlucky hand everything wrong |pg||
nt|roswolf: and a limit raise presumably showing 4 trumps|pg||
nt|garnetts: to make matter worse a @D lead automatic too|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: mainly for the lead |pg||
nt|the saint: The difficulty with X in those positions, is that it is always very hard to then get your 5-5ness across|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dagold: yes. 2@d as both majors is playable|pg||
nt|roswolf: if north doubles the lead will be shown|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: i hope no ethical pressure on south|pg||
nt|garnetts: Odd really why wouldn't North double?   I do not always favout these lead directing bids but I did here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cuttysark: The variable NT means this is a strong one - still 3NT looks quite a bold bid to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: at the other table, they lead a low club so 4@H made.|pg||
nt|dagold: Mcgee did indeed double|pg||
nt|dagold: so the 5@h bid hardly cost|pg||
nt|rmb1: Should be no ethical difficulties playing with screens|pg||
nt|garnetts: even with  HESITATION --the lead is still justified |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dagold: Brock would like slightly better intermediates to lead a club|pg||
nt|dagold: the 8 or the 9|pg||
nt|dagold: looks like 1 down|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cuttysark: A strong 10 - promises a higher honour and a broken sequence with H109 or HJ10 - will make short owrk of this|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@d, 2@c, 1@h, 1@s|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||
nt|garnetts: this would be Ok with a 100% rule |pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: in the other room east went for a weak nt opening and got her legs shot away|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|garnetts: a very good switch by North--will extract the max |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|cK|nt|helene_t:  do we know about the NS lead style? Jack is standad from KJT but the agreement that the ten shows two honors above is common here|pg||
pc|cT|nt|cuttysark: Fortunately for the Welsh the location of the major suit kings means that 2NT was also down|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|rmb1: Live TV at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/lady-milne-trophy (not this table)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s4|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|dagold: I prefer double of 2@c by south|pg||
pc|hA|nt|helene_t:  ah right, strong ten. thanks, Liz|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dagold: more flexible|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dagold: might have conceded 2@c doubled here of course!|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|garnetts: No end play possible |pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|h6|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|cuttysark: Many players play that the ten shows 0 or 2 higher, but that is not terribly popular in Scotland|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dagold: 1@s in the other room on an ugly auction so 3 imps to Ireland it seems|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dagold: the EBU team need some imps|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h3|pg||
mc|7|nt|roswolf: 3 imps to the irish though|pg||

nt|garnetts: 6@H makes because both spade honours are onside and WEst has the 9@S---my idea of a good slam as it makes :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes well spotted david|pg||
nt|rmb1: You only have to finesse South for @SQJ to make six|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: The Scots favour a weak NT style where you open 4card majors freely|pg||
nt|garnetts: quite difficult to avoid I think|pg||
mb|4H|nt|cuttysark: I would have expected them to reach 4@S without passing Go - and I see that they have really :)|pg||
nt|rmb1: Gerber?|pg||
nt|garnetts: I do hope that is not Gerber |pg||
nt|roswolf: was that gerber?|pg||
mb|p|nt|helene_t:  2@s showing hearts and a minor (michaels cuebid)|pg||
nt|dagold: heart lead likely|pg||
mb|5C|nt|dagold: which will make this cold|pg||
nt|bg: might get them here with a heart lead and a club guess|pg||
nt|the saint: This board could be a swing opportunity for the EBU if it gets played the other way up|pg||
nt|dagold: can guess club wrong though|pg||
nt|dagold: which won't matter here|pg||
nt|dagold: needed a minor suit lead and a spade through...|pg||
nt|dagold: Ireland have right-sided it too and made 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 4@H would show onw aCE|pg||
nt|roswolf: roland will not be pleased|pg||
mb|5S|nt|rmb1: The card says the play gerber as a direct response to NT|pg||
nt|garnetts: 5@C is additional gerber |pg||
nt|roswolf: rollinf g strikes again|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhb: Is there any gain in taking the K@H??|pg||
nt|dagold: she was worried about blocking herself if she won the heart in hand|pg||
mb|6N|nt|cuttysark: More bold bidding by the Welsh East has scored a goal here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|toobad: hard to avoid slam now |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a diamond lead more or less forces declarer into the winning line|pg||
nt|garnetts: North might well lead a spade--this is worse than 6@H as I think it needs spades 3-3 too|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|rmb1: 6NT needs @SQJ onside and spades 3-3, well bid !?|pg||
nt|roswolf: roland type odds|pg||
pc|h5|nt|garnetts: somewhere in the region of 8%|pg||
nt|toobad: we've all been in worse............ |pg||
nt|roswolf: yup i certainly have!:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: yep  no players |pg||
nt|rmb1: But as geoff pointed out the problem is shape duplication, and extra small club would make slam much better|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dagold: but she should still run it round as she could always overtake the heart later|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|dagold: so this has gone down it seems|pg||
nt|dagold: the contract was not as routine as it looks. Declarer can't see the nice club position|pg||
nt|dagold: but winning the heart king was not best|pg||
pc|sT|nt|garnetts: I have played bridge for longer than I care remember but I have never seen Gerber legitimately used |pg||
pc|s3|nt|cuttysark: North would much prefer to have her teeth into 5@D|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dagold: winning in hand then running the club T is reasonable|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|garnetts: Still haven't |pg||
nt|toobad: well i didnt see much examination of shape.. so they used the tools they had available, i presume|pg||
pc|s4|nt|dagold: if a spade comes through you can overtake the heart King and hope hearts are not worse than 4-2|pg||
nt|bg: in other room W won heart lead and lead club 10 N made mistake of covering end of defense|pg||
nt|dagold: good play by the irish west I think|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|dagold: so this is 1 down|pg||
nt|dagold: and EBU getting blitzed|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: Not if North leads a low spades and South puts up the King.|pg||
nt|toobad: what a player!!|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|deltadash: Sorry I'm late Alex!|pg||
nt|dagold: they came back in the first match Vs England, but this looks bad|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|dagold: Well done south|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|cuttysark: Hard to imagine why East thought a heart switch was a good idea - espcially with those diamonds!|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s9|nt|roswolf: the english were in the better slam in the other rooom|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|nt|toobad: W got the crux of the hand over right away and now smiles all round...... well bid P!!|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c3|pc|hT|nt|garnetts: However this is a very hard slam to avoid |pg||

nt|garnetts: I bet that was a claim |pg||

nt|garnetts: cost a trick if it was |pg||

mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|helene_t:  I think it was W who opened 1@h|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think it was a 3card limit raise+ - can't say I like the method if you then have to bid on over parter's signoff|pg||
nt|garnetts: might happen here too|pg||
nt|roswolf: seems normal enough though|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|garnetts: what was that double?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: a neg double by east - almost obscene|pg||

nt|cuttysark: East has to use 4th suit to create a game-forcing auction, since no number of hearts would be forcing|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|cuttysark: West shows a minimum and they stop at a safer level|pg||

nt|roswolf: last bd of this match now|pg||
mb|1D|nt|cuttysark: I do not have a VP scale handy for 24 boards, but I imagine Scotland must have a near maximum win here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: EW play a variable NT, strong when vulnerable|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: at the moment, probably 25-1.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|mb|2H|nt|dagold: chances here for EBU too|pg||
nt|the saint: To lead a top honour there is only going to work on almost that exact layout|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dagold: there are some more Alan but low of course is reasonable|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: West waved her hand at her 3NT bid.|pg||
nt|dagold: 3N= strong diamond hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: then when it went under the table she muttered oh crap.|pg||
nt|dagold: now maybe 4@c-4@s-4N?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|garnetts: a rare coffe hand here--David Greenwoods Grandmother can be left in charge |pg||
nt|rmb1: Next match starts at 11:50 in 12 minutes.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: thx to all my fellow commentators , robin +dave+ simon and john|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.elsid.co.za/bridge/templates/vpscale.html  here you are, Liz|pg||
nt|cuttysark: this lead makes it easy - another 3NT ontract where Scotland gain a game swing - seems to be their strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: So 24-6 at the moment|pg||
nt|dagold: now 4N perhaps|pg||
nt|dagold: which wpuld get them there|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Not that 3NT is beatable - the auction in the other room shows that NS had not discussed their defesive methods over a potentially 3card club suit|pg||
pc|dT|nt|roswolf: and to our great operator|pg||
pc|d4|nt|the saint: Next door, NS cramped the auction, and West's 4@S bid never came close to describing the power of her hand.|pg||
nt|dagold: Well done!|pg||
nt|the saint: All Sally needs is 'bullets'|pg||
nt|dagold: this is a good team board for EBU assuming nothing goes wrong from here|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: West taking a long time to count her key cards.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: and 25-4 after this board|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Very good start for the holders|pg||
pc|s7|nt|eamongall: she will count again maybe |pg||
nt|dagold: looks like 5@d may have been the wrong response|pg||
nt|dagold: that or 5@s is the wrong call but I suspect 5@d was the problem|pg||
nt|the saint: Yes, if 5@D was right, then East will have certainly bid 6.|pg||
nt|garnetts: Might eschew the spade finesse now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|the saint: Even if West corrects, there may be 'tempo' issues perhaps?|pg||
