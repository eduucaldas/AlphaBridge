nt|georgia19: oh good, nice to see old stars still full of ambition|pg||
nt|georgia19: I wish we were in Figueira, at the bar:(|pg||
nt|c_luiz: Figueira was a great tournament :) especially when "played" at the bar |pg||
nt|georgia19:  I miss it very much|pg||
nt|c_luiz: Madeira is a great tournament too .. you should return this year Georgia|pg||
nt|georgia19: perhaps we will, when is it this year Carlos, and PLEASE get this correct!!|pg||

nt|c_luiz: Steve Davis and John Higgins were on ... so I saw 2 hands |pg||
nt|c_luiz: we still waiting for the last round of this team's tournament in Estoril ... hopefully we wont wait much more|pg||
nt|georgia19: you are optimistic, Carlos, I am amazed how prompt things have been so far: we used to reckon Portuguese time was different to the rest of Europe|pg||

nt|rodal f: If u want 500 in u can make it now, but those X and meanings.|pg||

nt|othered1: I wouldn't hate a double of 1@S|pg||

nt|frankaus: its a 50/50 proposition with out the @S lead |pg||
nt|peachy: re, sry |pg||
nt|frankaus: declarer will clear trumps  = elimminate @C then take @D hook - but it no closer to picking the @S position|pg||
nt|peachy: if declarer guesses spades he will make even if diam finesse loses|pg||
