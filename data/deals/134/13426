mb|1S|nt|justin c: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|jni33: Scores before last segment: http://www.bridge.dk/4554/Klub1/Turneringer/Resultat637.html|pg||
nt|oleberg: Relay precision is known in most of the world as "Wiking club"|pg||
nt|oleberg: (Where it is known)|pg||
nt|jni33: Bjarnarson-Askgaard need to win with 16 imps to win the "tournament"|pg||
nt|oleberg: Both pairs play the 1@D opening as always unbalanced.|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@S makes here, and it is a reasonably good game, declarer would need oto be lucky in one of the black suits|pg||
nt|justin c: I guess 2@S here for NS|pg||
nt|miketedd: Margaret Lane and Val Kennewell are from West Wales.  They play Acol, with a weak NT, and three weak twos (but strong in 4th position).|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|oleberg: Which was the dominating method among the top pairs in the European Championship a year or to back|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S is usually the best with the south hand as she is prepared to play in at least 3@H|pg||
nt|jcwla: East with a slightly offshape double (no three-card support for @C's) but deems it important to get in with four of each major.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jcwla: The alert suggests there may be good/bad type implications to the free 3@D bid.|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: 3@D is alerted as promising values.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2/1 response by west|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: But not aces, it appears|pg||
mb|3D|nt|marlowepi: you mean they allow themselves 3 weak 2s per session? sensible arrangement...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Make the @CQ either black ace and this would come home, but although potentially six tricks, S might be expecting a bit bigger hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: good morning all|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Still, it's a small save against 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: West says "are you sure?" with a grin on her face, having seen dummy.|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: a @C, a @D, 2@h and a trump to lose|pg||
nt|henryb:  But they may not be able to get all of them|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mikeirl: -2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello, hi to all|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, W in the OR chose 3@H over 1@S, which would be fine except that E raised to game.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|roswolf: routine cue bidding will reveal the trump suit weakness|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Hi George, Geoff and John|pg||
nt|marlowepi: questionable opening lead, a doubleton into declarer's primary suit|pg||
pc|d7|nt|garnetts: not an easy hand to start with for EW  --normal contract--better maybe played the other way around might get out for one off|pg||

pc|c5|pc|d2|pg||

nt|oleberg: A true yarl|pg||
nt|mikeirl: perhaps dbl by E over2h is best T/O|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Crivvens has 2 vs, David - let us try for accuracy :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: maybe but 2NT did show 15-17--|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: 1@C is 2+|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcwla: E cashed the major aces and then eliminated any problems for N/S by cashing the @CA, so 2 to Scotland.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi David.|pg||
nt|dburn: accuracy in Scottish spelling? I will try, but I do not promise to succeed.|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, better for poker, at least he would have four nines :)|pg||
nt|chick: hi Marshall|pg||
nt|garnetts: an awkward hand for South to bid if North bids 1NT|pg||
nt|mikeirl: dbl is(11-14) :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  ty|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I know many players who would overcall with this South hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: well south should in modern style open this hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: and has|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: A Yarborough is a hand with no card higher than a nine spot. The term is derived from Lord Yarborough of England, who offered a wager with odds of 1,000 pounds to one against the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: chance of any player having such a holding. The actual chance of any player holding a hand with no card higher than a nine has been mathematically equated to 1,827 to 1|pg||
nt|garnetts: if you think 3@C is a good bid then start with it---not once the opps have got things together|pg||
nt|justin c: 1NT by somebody here|pg||
nt|copeyj: I don't think that is an opening bid 2nd in vulnerable - and I am only 28 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 3@C is awful in my view --poor suit and defensive values|pg||
nt|miketedd: 4@S probably OK here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|oleberg: And a killer in Chinese poker|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think the modern method of playing transfers over short clubs is a serious improvement|pg||
nt|justin c: seems to be very popular lately|pg||
nt|dburn: I know one or two who would pass a weak no trump with that West hand also|pg||
nt|roswolf: a normal limit raise it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: You may count me as one of the latter|pg||
nt|roswolf: far too old simon|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi all, sorry i missed  1|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi hamdi|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|justin c: the more transfers the better|pg||
nt|marlowepi: three rounds of diamonds?|pg||
nt|miketedd: The double worked well|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|oleberg: NS plays "Nilsland", so North's pass required redouble|pg||
nt|jcwla: If you so choose to come in, you would want to be playing something that let you show both black suits at the 2 level.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|miketedd: You can make 6 trumps and two AKs|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mikeirl: 3c  look  like winning  bid|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would not go that far, and I insist on being able to transfer or play the hand with the distribution concealed|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|roswolf: not convinced myself - if opps intervene these methods are very fallible|pg||
nt|dburn: then here's my hand, my old companion, and may neither one of us fall in a canyon|pg||
nt|miketedd: after 3 rounds of @Ds|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|garnetts: In what was is it a winning bid?   |pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|jni33: ohhh|pg||
nt|oleberg: Doing this, instead of bidding 2@S directly, tells the NT-opener, that he may compete to three, on a suitable hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lars will hate this lead, but the contract is still down|pg||
nt|patricck: Still not good enough. Declarer can lose only one club, but when east comes in A@S and another leaves nowhere to put the 4th @D|pg||
nt|garnetts: Directed NS into a makeable contract |pg||
nt|cuttysark: heart finess and a club to the king and waht was the problem?|pg||
nt|dburn: only that South might take four spades and a club, but maybe that was unlucky|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2010January-July/LadyMilne/results.htm  for results and standings after round 3|pg||
pc|c5|nt|patricck: *west|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if you don't bid with E hand, what is the good hand after 1NT opps opening?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|copeyj: anyway - A "normal" opening bid and a "normal" limit raise has got them too high here|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c7|pg||
nt|justin c: seems to me that transfer replies are a bit double edged|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|roswolf: not a lot of playing strength for declarer here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|justin c: more options for your side, but also more for theirs|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|s3|nt|oleberg: Quite a position from South, to bid 4@S|pg||
nt|henryb:  not covering the @c10 is wrong. suppose partner has 9xxx!|pg||
nt|justin c: particularly where they get to X a 1@H bid that shows @S|pg||
nt|copeyj: honours in short suits are not good news|pg||
pc|sA|nt|oleberg: But being behind 16 against very competent opponents, it may be ok|pg||
nt|jni33: Maybe Lars liked the lead ... when he saw dummy he was very happy not being left in 3@h dbl |pg||
nt|patricck: Even if the bidding is invitational from North his hand is not that attractive|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|justin c: where a natural 1@S bid makes things a lot less pleasant|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It's a pity that the second half of this match will be played tomorrow, but I guess we are fortunate that the event has survived the cloud of ash at all|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|jcwla: Here's a case where the @D6 is definitely not the "idle fifth" - a Sabine Auken term.  Wants to keep four @H's and that @C holding.  Still, as declarer always be on the lookout for ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: your opps' first throwaway - so often it is the "idle fifth" card in their long suit and tells you information.  Also, as defenders do not always make that your first pitch, but of ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: course don't sacrifice a potentially important card from a shorter suit.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: At least East has one valuable card, @D9, the Curse of Scotland|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi everyone|pg||
pc|cK|nt|oleberg: No. But NS is also much into making a good system, so there may be something we dont know|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h4|nt|patricck: good play, now West must play A@S @S or it might make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But if anyone can work that out, Lars is the man|pg||
nt|oleberg: West might think declarer fears an overruff|pg||
nt|oleberg: But he is opening his communication for a crossruff|pg||
nt|patricck: West will fear that North's @D are Q9xx |pg||
nt|Walddk2: What can he do if they are?|pg||
nt|patricck: northing I guess, but maybe another @H might be right if partner has J@S|pg||
nt|oleberg: Lars knows that NS are very good, but also very gutsy. And ready to take a position, if they believe in it.|pg||
nt|jni33: Lars has the @h J in hand ... under the table ... noone else than Emil and I can see it|pg||
nt|jni33: "the little details" says Lars|pg||
nt|patricck: North really needs @S KQJxx for the bidding. playing partner to hold 9@D seems better odds than the J@S|pg||
nt|oleberg: not so obvious to me|pg||
nt|jni33: now @c A in hand|pg||
nt|oleberg: Even without the @SJ, the bids seem okay|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Small wishes come true more frequently than big ones|pg||
nt|patricck: Surely A@C can't be right? North bid out his shape|pg||
nt|oleberg: As far as I know, the sequence wasn't invitational|pg||
nt|patricck: South must have thought so because his hand was hardly a gem of a 1NT opener :)|pg||
nt|jni33: Lars asks a lot of questions to Michael|pg||
nt|jni33: "can N have 4@s and 5@d" he askes ... "I have newer seen it" is Michaels response|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|oleberg: It is suggested, that East would have played a high diamond on the heart, if he wanted an uppercut|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Emil could see that the 8 was big enough, so he played that. Well done :)|pg||

mb|1S|nt|h_karluk: I am told that this is Margaret Lane, sorry |pg||
mb|d|mb|1N|nt|oleberg: Slightly off-shape take-out double, but nescesary|pg||
nt|roswolf: might be easier for e/w to get to the spade game now|pg||

nt|chick: I rarely get better shape than that for a takeout|pg||
nt|jni33: I'll try to keep you updated with results from the other three tables later|pg||
nt|patricck: South can diagnose that there is spade shortage opposite and his own spades are rubbish, so he should have bid 5@D|pg||
nt|oleberg: North knows that South has 5 diamonds or more, unless he is marmic|pg||
nt|chick: and non vul opposite vul makes it even more attractive|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/lady-milne-trophy  for streaming TV. First time on BBO|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: heading to 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes wrong country as well!:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: was 1N for minors?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|oleberg: I do not find it obvious that South should have bid 5@D. Other things than thrumphs may defeat games, abd partner may already have taken a position|pg||
nt|patricck: Quite right for North to pass, he doesn't want to sacrifice if South has 4 chunky spades. South is the one who can see how bad his spades are|pg||
nt|oleberg: But surely 5@D would be tempting|pg||
nt|miketedd: just 5-9 points I guess|pg||
mb|3N|nt|henryb:  I suppose West is a little strong for 2@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: i hope they are not locked into clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: There a a few players that would bid 1@H on the North tickets--anyone for that?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  playing for @s ace by E - looks good|pg||
nt|henryb:  This seems like a sensible auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am always nervous when players think so long in a straightforward auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: tends to result in an imaginative call|pg||
nt|henryb:  East is not sure: partner is probably 3=1=5=4 which seems to make the @hK a doubtful value, and a void opposite partner's five card suit is never particularly good|pg||
nt|justin c: sounds right to me|pg||
nt|justin c: @HK may be no use|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: EW have "stolen" North's suits so she'll be happy to defend|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: now north might lead a heart|pg||
nt|marlowepi: over here there would be few supporters of Double on the N hand. 2D would be near-unanimous. unless pd can bid NT over 2D, you won;t have missed a game|pg||
nt|miketedd: Not a pretty contract|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jcwla: Board 2 entered as England making an overtrick in 2NT, but I don't think that's right.|pg||
nt|daman: good guess|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Glad he is not in slam now|pg||

pc|c5|nt|sharkey: Think a trump lead would stand out here|pg||
nt|henryb:  that is not sensible, I think. Partner will tend to play you for a 4 card spade suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm east for me has suggested 5-5 in the blacks|pg||
nt|henryb:  more 4-5 I think, or 4-3-2-4|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: can't east still even 4-4 in the blacks with no @H stop?|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd2 the welsh e/w bid and made 4@S - well done|pg||
pc|c6|nt|roswolf: suppose so but .. i dont think it too likely|pg||
nt|roswolf: spade lead and continuation would have beaten this out of hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  luckily for E-W everything, and I mean everything sits well: @cQ onside, spades  and clubs 3-2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks as if EW can make 3NT here, rather fortunately|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|oleberg: If it was only an eight card fit, a 4-1 break can be a nuisance, even if it is four small|pg||

nt|roswolf: north overuffs the third spade!|pg||
nt|henryb:  does not help, Justin. the @cQ is higher than the J|pg||
nt|justin c: sry, I'm playing this the wrong way around |pg||
nt|justin c: would need to play @D to get rid of @S from East|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think north might have tried the @S lead since it guarantees -1 on the bidding if pard has the trump ace|pg||
nt|henryb:  that is a good point made by the operator. the hand would have been a lot trickier if Lane had ducked the first club|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  oh, sorry - wrong view|pg||
nt|miketedd: Wales pulled themselves together and played well against England, achieving a creditable draw.  Their third match saw a narrow loss to Ireland.  |pg||
nt|miketedd: Then the 1st half of the fourth match against England saw another terrible set in one room, and despite levelling the 2nd half this match was also lost.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think you were right that the hand was a make with careful attention|pg||

nt|roswolf: a 20/20 hcp hand - and may be quite feisty|pg||

nt|daman: maybe a @C partscore for EW?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|garnetts: routine 4@H for EW |pg||
nt|roswolf: south will bid a lot i fear|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: South needs to know what her partner has in mind, no need to rush when you don't know where you are going|pg||
mb|1N|nt|oleberg: 2@S shows a good raise to 2@S|pg||
nt|oleberg: The weak raise is included in the forcing 1NT response|pg||
nt|mikeirl: perhaps, but needs to be careful|pg||
nt|garnetts: may or may not make too many inponderables to tell |pg||
nt|sharkey: @C lead best I think|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|justin c: get out into 3@c, or leave it in 1NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Do they play Romex?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H looks like a short suit trial bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: Nobody leads a @D in my view or a stiff trump|pg||
nt|sharkey: lot of work to be done - lead @D twice - @H finesse - pull trumps; no laydown hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  I get out in 3@c|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup me 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: north will pass as quickly as she can|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: probably @SK|pg||
nt|mug: 2@S quite correct in 5-card major style|pg||
nt|mug: you may have no shortage but partner will have at least one doubleton|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4@S gives no info to opps, just come and get me.|pg||
nt|roswolf: clubs have been lost|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: nothing to the play, park the diamond loser on @HK, club hook for the overtrick|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Lots of trump leads in this event. Not many bringing in imps though|pg||
nt|mug: this is a pretty standard trump lead auction, barring a singleton or strong sequence|pg||
nt|marlowepi: coffee break hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|patricck: That will encourage North to lead 9@C rather than K@H|pg||
nt|garnetts: Agree with that routine to bid good views to make.  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2-1 odds say play high|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkey: agree David|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks like an easy 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: Sandra neglected golden principle : try to make a bid which partner can gain from|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@D is some false preference - i would pass 1@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|oleberg: 3@C must be constructive on the (11) 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is some upgrade to a 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|patricck: What drugs are NS on here?  Can we have some?|pg||
nt|oleberg: Only North seems to be on drugs on this hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: too easy to get to the slam i think|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h is okay. 5@d is excellent. 6@d is acceptable and unfortunate|pg||
nt|justin c: not a good time to try 6@D|pg||
nt|mug: current English style is not to worry too much about having values for one-level overcall|pg||
nt|jcwla: Get that lead director in at the one level.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: of course, there is a losing case--S with 3 spades & Jx of diamonds AND declarer plays high from dummy after your duck. that is a massively odds-against parlay though|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: I wud|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: I think 1@S from South not unreasonable|pg||
nt|mikeirl: agree with the weak 2 from North alright|pg||
mb|1N|nt|h_karluk: it makes the biddding very, very easy when any responder "c a n" raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|marlowepi: many hyperactive players would double on W hand, but Heathering is right to pass. after E original pass you are going nowehere, so why tell NS how to play the hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg: Upgrading the North hand to 11 good seems far out, maybe he miscounted|pg||
nt|jni33: "I had 12 when I opened" says Gregers .... "12 card og 12 hcp" asks Askgaard ... :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The North hand is worth 9.9 according to K&R|pg||

mb|p|nt|oleberg: Mathias Bruun partners Lars' older brother, Knut.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: good auction. approve of upgrade|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cuttysark: Always a bit upsetting to direct a lead and have partner ignore you|pg||

nt|jcwla: Great way to upset pd.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|roswolf: it looks to me that 2@C was not gameforcing since i would have an easy 3@D GF CALL|pg||
nt|mug: yeah, partner clearly doesn't have much when you have 9 HCP, so she probably does at least have a decent suit|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT needs the @D finesse, in which case you might as well play 6@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: QUITE|pg||
nt|justin c: i dont know their bidding system|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: Geoffrey, however you play 4SF you have a way to show a GF raise with @Ds surely?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is horrible and deserves to lose a game swing|pg||
nt|justin c: was thinking that if 2@C forced to game, then hands that want to agree @S in a forcing way could bid 2@s over 2@D|pg||
pc|h2|nt|justin c: leaving a 3@S jump available as a splinter raise of @D|pg||

nt|marlowepi: S hand looks a bit like a green-on-red TO double to me|pg||
mb|2H|nt|justin c: and a big swing to wales|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Fine line between inspired and not in partnership best interest.  Anyway, on to this battle with E/W holding both majors and N/S nine clubs.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: only @d K missing|pg||
nt|miketedd: Very conservative pass of 2@H in the other room, but I don't know how they made 4|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: well 3nt looks obvious to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: individual mistakes by N and S have proved very costly|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=A10+A10+AKQJ9x+Q98|pg||
nt|henryb:  an easy 3N; 4@s has no play|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 6nt by east looks possible too|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: as we can now see from 4@H - 1 in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: can't you make 5 in @Ss if you can see all the cards?|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 31/9 , worths to try?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: conservative pass of 3C here too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once E shows a club fit, W ought to be making another try at least|pg||
pc|d5|nt|henryb:  no, but you can make 4|pg||
nt|jcwla: Could do worse than to agree 2NT never to play when opps have bid and raised a suit.  Here, it's got them to a really nice spot.  Well timed auction by Brown.|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: West inquired and South said undiscussed.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with heart king off, though, the conservatism looks to be rewarded|pg||
pc|d2|nt|henryb:  the defense can always get three trump tricks|pg||

pc|h3|nt|mug: to be fair I don't recall discussing this bid with any partner|pg||
nt|mug: it's too obvious to discuss|pg||
nt|jcwla: Agree with Tom - this is just bridge.  Question not totally ridiculous as N could have made a neg X on first round, but still...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|daman: Wales picked up 5 IMPS for the EBU miscue on Board 4|pg||
nt|miketedd: and trumps 4-0|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: clubs 4-0 this way would not help the defense if W plays 3N|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mug: if you have agreed to play bridge, you have agreed 2NT here is minors|pg||
pc|d6|pc|cQ|pc|dK|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d7|pc|cA|nt|henryb:  good play. can't cost and might gain an uptrick|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Askgaard hoped he had an entry (@HK) but no|pg||

nt|h_karluk: still thinking was it unreasonable to pass as West hand or not if she had no clear means to proceed|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: he did have an entry, but not in time|pg||

nt|roswolf: this is trappy for n/s|pg||
mb|1H|nt|daman: North may just punt 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: a firm 3nt is what the doctor ordered|pg||
nt|h_karluk: why not 3N by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: science may not be a friend here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|oleberg: Not everyone will open the North hand 1NT vul|pg||
nt|patricck: The difficulty is not knowing what sort of hand east had. If you knew it was a long running suit type maybe you wouldn't lead a @C at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: wud 2@H by W be an option?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The complicated line cost an imp|pg||
nt|mug: forgot to cash @HA|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: Spec suggests that North should have bid 3@S over 3@C. That would have made it easier for South|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, declarer could have had @CQx|pg||
nt|oleberg: I know I said 1@D is always unbalanced, but third hand gives libetyes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which looked entirely possible as he got an even count (@C3). Sadly, it was a singleton|pg||
nt|oleberg: And it is highly likely that a diamond will be the best lead from partner|pg||
nt|garnetts: NS will do well to stop low here|pg||
nt|dburn: interesting line in acronyms - perhaps Shakespeare was the forerunner of the iPod when he wrote HPOD|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some might make a passed-hand double as S to bring the majors into the picture.|pg||
nt|daman: all roads should lead to 3NT    but not at this table|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes which is why it is trappy|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Not my cup of tea with AKxxx vul|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be ok but some scope for an accident|pg||
mb|p|nt|miketedd: Unwise 4NT in the other room.  After the 5@H response, 6@D could be off 2Aces, and it will be a finesse for the @DK at best|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even in acol, 2D seems a lot to bid with a poor suit, a quacky hand, a stiff in pd's suit, and red to boot|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jni33: Board 1 has now been played at one other table ... S 4@s making 10 ... same as here|pg||
nt|garnetts: South has nothing to add|pg||
nt|roswolf: imaginative re-opening by west|pg||
pc|c9|nt|garnetts: But it will need some playing to make |pg||
nt|sharkey: think this will be off 2|pg||

nt|justin c: doubleton @SKJ in the pocket|pg||

nt|garnetts: Still this might lead to a 4@S phantom save |pg||
nt|vugraphzha: I think they play this as constructive|pg||
mb|d|nt|cuttysark: Just so long as no-one mentions the Scottish play|pg||
mb|3S|nt|garnetts: North more or less forced to double |pg||
nt|sharkey: I wud bid 3@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|h_karluk: balancing seat|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looking over these hands so far, it occurs to me that in many VG events game would be played in both rooms on every board except perhaps  1|pg||
mb|p|nt|jni33: Board 8: S 2@h making 10 is the only result so far|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would bid 4@S |pg||
nt|mug: but HPOD is two-thirds the number of letters as Hamlet |pg||
nt|marlowepi: often failing of course|pg||
mb|4C|nt|h_karluk: I guess Margaret isn't excited |pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: or even 4|pg||

mb|p|nt|justin c: (and cant reopen)|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: seems too difficult to bid|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not a bad slam here - South has preumably shown a good 4+card raise, so we shall await developments|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: 3@C = 11-14points|pg||
nt|mug: would not dream of mentioning TSP|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: 3@D = shape ask|pg||
nt|roswolf: the dragon breathes fire|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chick: likely to be duplicated here|pg||
nt|oleberg: A minisplinter in 3@C might have done the trick, but...|pg||
nt|garnetts: PASS!!!!!!!!!!!  grrrrrrrrrrrr|pg||
nt|henryb:  East had to lead a @d to beat this, or a high @h and a @d shift|pg||
nt|mug: 4@C presumably shows the singleton|pg||
nt|mug: now I think Stockdale is worth one move with 4@D|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Last Train?|pg||
nt|mug: 4@D whatever it means|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: I'm not entirely sure because West hasn't asked but I assume so; I'd have thought that 3@H shows a club singleton in this auction.|pg||
nt|mug: yes for me too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too tough for N to find a pass|pg||
nt|miketedd: I am sure the 2nd double is just values, so I don't know why it took a while to bid 4@C|pg||
pc|s2|nt|garnetts: What do you need to double another ace ?|pg||
nt|henryb:  West, I mean|pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: could be a very difficult sequence to untangle |pg||
nt|roswolf: dont fancy this|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@H not really that good a contract anyway even though there are only 3 obvious losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: The description from South is "I think it's a splinter"|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@d looks right - 4NT looks too much, but it will work|pg||
nt|h_karluk: auto 6 losers on Major suits|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps a slight overbid, a lot of second and third round controls needing coverage|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, S double clearly responsive, values without 4 hearts|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s6|nt|oleberg: It is not an obvious convention to play, and the hand might not be well suited.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So would you bid 3@S to show a singleton diamond?|pg||
nt|mug: surely having got to 5@H she bid six?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sharkey: pick up 50 vs losing 170?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 4@Sx in the other room on the last board|pg||
nt|henryb:  the 2@h bid can't really have AKA|pg||
pc|c9|nt|cuttysark: Yes, but West did not|pg||
nt|mug: with any luck the 12th trick will arrive on the lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|oleberg: And the contract cant make on best defence (I hope, since I said it)|pg||
nt|dburn: well, maybe, but a club looks normal|pg||
nt|roswolf: on the potential slam wales went -2 in 6@H|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|sharkey: must admit I wudn't considered 4@H on East's miserable picture collection|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcwla: 6@H = "We're missing one."  More chances to get  12 if W on lead.|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as u say, 4C auto, even though par is to pass. passing at IMPs would be criminal even when right on the hand|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|patricck: even with everything breaking 3 rounds of trumps will take it off|pg||
nt|mug: unfortunately that had the effect of removing a losing option|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mikeirl: agree|pg||
nt|henryb:  didn't she make 460? 4@s, 5@c, a @h and a @d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: score agreed as 430|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mikeirl: East is a strong, aggressive player|pg||
nt|dburn: still, this is a decent slam - perhaps fortuitously; if North had @dQ instead of @sQ it would be close to hopeless, yet the bidding would be the same|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mug: but I agree, club lead was a good safe lead in principle, declarer's shortage|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jcwla: And with Scotland stopping short we will have a new leader.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|d4|nt|h_karluk: push next board please|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||

pc|d6|nt|mikeirl: not really - big loss coming on Board 7|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|mug: test spades first, then ruff a spade, then go back to diamond finesse I suppose|pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|nt|oleberg: 2@C = Transfer to diamonds|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jni33: Board 9: We have to results so far: Table 1: N 2@s making 5 tricks .... Table 2: E 3@c making 8 tricks|pg||
nt|oleberg: 2@D = Non-exceptional hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt by south could be bid and if doubled by west could get a heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: anybody prefer 1@H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: yes i think that was the case|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oops, seriously 3@d? why not 2N?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 5C a very dangerous bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S may think u are striving hard to get a club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg: 2@C can contain a club suit too, or a balanced invitational hand. So a superaccept was not an option|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apart from fact that you may be turning a plus into a minus|pg||
mb|5S|nt|mikeirl: is that asking or showing|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: asking|pg||
nt|garnetts: I can see that 6@D is laydown but very lucky with QJ doubleton heart|pg||
nt|henryb:  I abhor 1N with a 5-4, particularly with 5-4 and a 5 card major|pg||
mb|6D|nt|mug: won't make but West was entitled to try game, East is expected to have her share|pg||
nt|miketedd: Wow|pg||

nt|daman: Brock went for the jugular    and it worked|pg||
nt|h_karluk: An unusual auction indeed, what if West did not double, perhaps i would never learn East's lead to 3N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure why E bid 5S with 6322 hand that had a very mmoderate offense-to-defense ratio, at unfavorable colors facing a preemptive raise. odd choice got what it deserved in my view|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|2H!|nt|oleberg: 1@C = 15-19 bal. or natural|pg||
nt|justin c: north wants to get involved here|pg||
nt|mug: so perhaps Susan needed to overtake @DK to avoid some obscure squeeze|pg||
nt|mug: but I think they defended pretty well, in practical terms|pg||
nt|dburn: or just the normal variety - declarer ruffs a heart, cashes a club, draws trump and ducks a club to North|pg||
nt|dburn: who has only hearts left, and South is squeezed by @hK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 5SX would have been almost as bad|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4H|nt|sharkey: easier from our point of view|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@S or 3NT is easy---with that in mind  in the pass out seat would 2@S not show this hand type?|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree |pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@S shows a good opener with a nice 6 bagger|pg||
nt|justin c: this double looks best to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: south isnt thinking of passing - is she?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I too agree with the Scottish approach|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: fairly common kind of guess, what South should do over the double of 4@S|pg||
nt|dburn: not that that double was altogether obvious, facing a passed partner into the bargain|pg||
nt|jcwla: I confess to preferring Symonds' choice of 4NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: they'll end up in one of the makeable games I think|pg||
nt|garnetts: David Greenwood's grand mother would bid game now |pg||
nt|vugraphzha: W was thinking|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah|pg||
nt|justin c: West has clubs on this auction, so South should know better than to go there|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if I'd bid 4NT and partner bid five hearts, I would give her six|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Our operator obviously has his own views :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: West asking about the double.|pg||
nt|mug: double is really a 5@H bid hoping partner will leave in with some unsuitable dummies|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Why?|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: double = strong nt type hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: 4NT = take out|pg||
nt|dburn: just in case she had a hand too good for an immediate 5@h, which is what I would have for this sequence|pg||
nt|mug: is that what Brown & Stockdale play?|pg||
nt|miketedd: West found a brave 4@H bid in t'other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: on what auction?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharkey: ouch - trouble|pg||
nt|garnetts: Oh dear |pg||
nt|sharkey: North has an Ace to many for that bid|pg||
nt|justin c: that, anyway, is how you plan to win the post mortem|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jni33: Board 10: Has been played twice ... W 3nt making 7 tricks at both tables|pg||
nt|oleberg: The system card doesn't say, but my guess is, that 3@C is slightly invitaional, facing a natural club (11+)|pg||
nt|justin c: if 2@D from N, S would choose @H with equal length, which is not what you want|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|garnetts: you simply cannot miss laydown vulnerable games and expect to win |pg||
nt|mug: I don't think it shows too good for 5@H, just less heart-oriented|pg||
nt|dburn: but I confess, I would not double with those North cards, nor would I bid 5@h over 4@s|pg||
nt|mug: if I'm too good for an immediate 5@H I bid 6@H David|pg||
nt|miketedd: It was easier after a 2@H overcall.  But I'm not sure that suit quality would have let me bid it|pg||
pc|hT|nt|henryb:  but S will do that over X also|pg||
nt|mug: it's scary stuff|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The defence against slam would have been more interesting|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Here there is only an overtrick at stake|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, Tom, but you and I belong to the hopelessly old-fashioned school|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chick: There are double dummy ways to make 8 tricks, which would be a very good result at MPs|pg||
nt|oleberg: Og dog.|pg||
nt|oleberg: It has been confirmed, that 3@C was invitaional facing an 11+ club opener.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jni33: It seems that Board 2 is going to be a loss for Bjarnarson-Askgaard ... two other tables have now played board 2 ... one table 1@h RD making 7 .. other table 4@s DBL making 10|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk4: Impressive!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in a 4 card M and 11-14 NT this auction is quite normal, in any natural and 15-17 bal NT range the answer is rather easy|pg||
pc|s7|nt|oleberg: 1@H RD 7 must be EW?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: Alas, it's only worth 1 IMP|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|justin c: maybe not|pg||
nt|justin c: if 2@D from N could be 4@S5@H |pg||
nt|henryb:  why? except by now you are sure E has the @hK, so you won't take the finesse|pg||
pc|s5|nt|oleberg: No, not really|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: a pedestrian 1H seems clear. you might belong in a different suit, and you have enough to balance with double if opps die low. meanwhile, you should also get to game when partner ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: has a fit|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sharkey: no - Vul games shud be bid with more that 37% chance of success at IMPs according science|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|garnetts: The good news is that they gained 12 by keeping low on baord 7--the bad news is they have just given them back |pg||

mb|d|nt|jcwla: Cannot complain about a bunch of flat hands in this set.  Hi, Roland.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Why not, David, with only three cards in the majors?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|oleberg: Bjarnarson has a trick up his sleeve again.|pg||
nt|jni33: Board 11: Two tables have played this board ... at both tables E played 3@s ... making 8 tricks at one table and 9 at the other table|pg||
nt|sharkey: Shows that preempts make it difficult|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: 1@S could have longer @Ds|pg||
nt|roswolf: and a raise to 2nt |pg||
nt|h_karluk: xx @s was not a deterrent factor for her|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|mikeirl: i would be shy to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg: 2@H = Usp = A good raise to 2@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: well finis?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They cannot, as a rule, double 4@C for penalties|pg||
nt|dburn: too much defence, too much chance we might make 3NT, that kind of thing|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but I worry too much|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Will partner play you for such a good hand after 3@C and bid 3NT when it's right?|pg||
nt|mug: he can bid always 4NT to play over 4@C|pg||
nt|mug: it never makes but it shows sophistication|pg||
nt|mug: meanwhile I don't see the problem with 4@H|pg||
nt|mug: win @CQ, ruff a club, play hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: never is for weak ni'ers|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not necessarily, but I cannot get to 3NT over 4@c even when it is cold, and if I open 4@c partner may do the wrong thing if West bids four of a major|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chick: so an opportunity for a good result (one way or the other) here|pg||
nt|garnetts: You need a personal policy here--either you always double or you always pass--more to be said for double if you are vunerable more to gain then|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT would be more fun|pg||
nt|daman: this contract is doomed|pg||
pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: interchange EW hands would it be an easy victory?|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|sharkey: what makes this game so interesting...:)|pg||

nt|daman: yes|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
nt|oleberg: But it would have been the heart finesse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: (1) was 1D conventional? seems an odd choice otherwise  (2) Pass by N over 1D seems unduly tame   (3) maybe 2C by E would express ahnd better?|pg||

nt|daman: and now a trump promotion   lol|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am sorry i do not see any slim chance to bring it home|pg||

nt|roswolf: ROUTINE GAME|pg||
mb|d|nt|jni33: Board 12 has been played twice so far .... E 4@s making 10 tricks at both tables|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our gratitude to BGB and the EBU for ensuring that this event is brought to BBO. Sandra Claridge, Michael Clark and Max Bavin have been instrumental in setting up a marvellous ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: show. Greatly appreciated by bridge fans all over the world|pg||
nt|mug: and well done everyone for rearranging everything at short notice|pg||
mb|3H|nt|oleberg: He either has to upgrade two point, for a 1@C opening|pg||
nt|justin c: a wise man once wrote that the 1NT bidder has @C on this auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm east might choose2@C|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks also to all specs and to the tireless Roland Wald.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Restart at 10:00 local time tomorrow with the second half of the three matches in progress|pg||
nt|Walddk4: For full vugraph schedule, please go to http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  and bookmark it!|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps a strong heart raise reflected the character of Guy's hand better than 3@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: my pleasure Geoffrey, thanks operator, fellow commentators and Roland <for his untiring efforts>|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|justin c: so the partner of the doubler 'should not go there'|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: I believe that would be GF for them|pg||
nt|roswolf: BLOOD may flow|pg||
nt|justin c: assuredly|pg||
nt|roswolf: west is sharpening her axe for 2@S|pg||
nt|justin c: West will deal with 2@S|pg||
nt|justin c: ad idem|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: W giving it some thought what to do|pg||
nt|roswolf: if south has passed west should do likewise in sleep|pg||
nt|mug: now Punch is excited because she thinks she has a fantastic hand for diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: restart in 1 hour and 5mins from now|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S was a bright and bold effort by west|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i smell 530 on the way|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzha: S bid 2@S a while ago|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok now double as ethically as possible ie stand on your chair|pg||
nt|justin c: if not X, then - what?|pg||
nt|justin c: nothing else is remotely appealing|pg||
nt|dburn: they play four-card majors?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes|pg||
nt|mug: ah|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2010January-July/LadyMilne/results.htm  for results and standings after round 2|pg||
nt|mug: well I'd expect West to see her advance cue through with 4@D|pg||
nt|mug: the problem is that 5@D goes down |pg||
nt|dburn: I confess that if I were West I would pass 3NT now|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg: or make a 2@C call that doesn't do the hand justice|pg||
nt|roswolf: east should wave the content card|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What is lead directional, Alex?|pg||
nt|dburn: I mean, partner did not have to bid it over the double of 3@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: Asking for a spade lead.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh double of 3@S|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe she feared that removing to diamonds would sound like a slam try - but in that case the cuebid was wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: whoops le punt|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Uh oh, spaghetti-O's.|pg||
nt|mug: Stockdale will lead Brown's suit, even if not vice versa |pg||
nt|h_karluk: depends lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: the heart lead is difficult to find|pg||
nt|marlowepi: my heroine!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|miketedd: S hasn't passed yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: This might have been a more interesting board with colours reversed|pg||
nt|sharkey: Has to work for 9 tricks I think|pg||
nt|garnetts: There is some contention as to whether 2NT here should show 15-17 if playing a weak no-trump|pg||
nt|roswolf: blood will flow|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @s and @d lead you are almost at home|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: 3NT just went off on the previous board in the other room|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: whoops a major goal for n/s|pg||
pc|hA|nt|garnetts: Some experts argue that you may need to bid 2NT with say xx KJxx AKJxx  xx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard to tell if the 4D bid was slow, as it may have been. if so, the pass by S could be called into question|pg||
pc|h7|nt|patricck: N/S vul there is no incentive for NS to push to 5 of a minor|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think it shud David show 15-17 - Dbl of 2@H shows more points than Dbl of 1@H|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Pity to end ona sour note - the bridge in this match has been very good thus far|pg||
nt|Walddk4: :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|justin c: (presumably on a @H misguess)|pg||
nt|justin c: whoever said that it would be fun clearly didnt know what he was talking about|pg||
pc|dA|nt|oleberg: Double dummy, 5@D is only one off, but..|pg||
nt|mikeirl: needed @S switch|pg||
pc|d5|nt|h_karluk: i don't get it|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sharkey: still only 8|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)irony - superb|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk4: Sour?|pg||
nt|roswolf: neither do i|pg||
nt|h_karluk: why overtake winner|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: ace and another diamond guarantees -2|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|miketedd: If the pass were slow (screens in use, so unlikely to be considered slow), then surely bidding would be more suspect|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk4: She won trick 1|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d8|nt|roswolf: ????????????|pg||
nt|roswolf: really?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sharkey: 7 with double finesse in @D|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|garnetts: That is the point Carl--they argue 3NT is the right rebid with the North hand |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mug: AWTEW|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if you show a stopper in the bidding, you don't need one in the play|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mug: bye for now|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cuttysark: Well, there you go then - a stopper is in the mind of the beholder|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont see how screens could matter here. if there were any delay in the auction, it would be totally obvious that N was the trancer|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|justin c: @DA was better|pg||
nt|miketedd: She's playing this well.  But my saying so will cause her to go wrong now I expect|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cK|pg||
nt|sharkey: ok - wudnt bid 2 NT with xx KJxx AKxxx xx - probably abstain :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk4: And when partner does not support, she does not have four|pg||
nt|daman: this whole match has been amazing (he said, tongue-in-cheek)    it must be the volcanic ash in the water|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some of that welsh supernatural power stuff?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|justin c: a pitch on the @C10 is no use to declarer (who has 4@H on the auction)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So the duck was correct everything considered|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Even Vul v not with no big cards.....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cool|pg||
pc|c9|nt|garnetts: This is an onging debate with the proponents of the weak notrump--but many have given up the 12-14 notrump anyway|pg||
nt|jcwla: Western cuebid not cuebid by West.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks again to all - for now, so long.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks all, see you tomorrow. Was fun|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: thank you all.|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: Bye.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So England 4 imps up in a vital match - all to play for tomorrow|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h6|nt|vugraphzha: last board from here. should be restarting shortly|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye for now|pg||
nt|justin c: bye all|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup or just early morning blues|pg||
pc|s8|nt|h_karluk: bye|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye for now|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|sharkey: so 2 NT shud be a skewed hand - x AJx AKJxxx Qxxx|pg||
mc|9|nt|miketedd: Drawing trumps instead of a 2nd @D would have given West a problem|pg||
nt|miketedd: Thank you all for watching.  Restart in 25 minutes or so|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if she was going to lead a club toward the jack anyway, better to do it at trick four, before 2nd trump|pg||
