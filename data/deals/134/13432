nt|sybarra: and we will get the names up as soon as the operator has time |pg||
nt|vugraphzha: They should all be up there now :)|pg||
nt|justin c: welcome back all|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: hi everyone. play just getting underway|pg||
nt|justin c: 5@D for EW here, 6 makeable|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi all|pg||
nt|justin c: hi geoff|pg||
nt|lark20: Good morning all|pg||
nt|justin c: the previous set was horrible for wales - will see if they regrouped during the break|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: yep |pg||
mb|2H!|nt|iain sime: Good morning all.|pg||
mb|d|nt|justin c: cue bid then @D from W to show a serious raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: Do people prefer dble from the E hand here?|pg||
nt|justin c: prefer 1@D myself|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed just avoid the 3nt trap is the name of the game here|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: no show the suit is right|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzha: 2@D might only be 3 as 1NT was forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: can you in Europe see the ash in clouds? |pg||
nt|vugraphzha: seems a beautiful clear day here actually|pg||
nt|justin c: easy to see a X getting into trouble|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: how does dble get into trouble?|pg||
nt|justin c: W might cue 2@C and continue with @H|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|sybarra: had friends in Europe saying similar,  didnt see "bad"" |pg||
nt|vugraphzha: quite rare for manchester|pg||
nt|sybarra: *didnt seem  |pg||
nt|justin c: this 3@D bid is a bit obscure|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D looks the spot on the bidding to date|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make up to 3@C    n/s  can compet in spades  and may make 9 tricks unless defence can take 2 diamond tricks before hearts are established for a pitch of a diamond|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|justin c: no real reason for East to find a heart lead|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|iain sime: 4@C should be one light after a normal spade lead.|pg||
nt|ady: dbl from east sub minimum =  the fashion now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lark20: she will always do this especially with 5 hearts|pg||
nt|iain sime: Still one light but the defence will have only one more chance to cash two spades.|pg||
nt|ady: dont think that will be too difficult|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi all|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c2|nt|justin c: the @DK does declarer no harm at all|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 4@H was obscure|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzha: p might have held 5?|pg||
nt|roswolf: not really|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d9|nt|justin c: 1@D also directs the lead if South is about to bid a major here|pg||

nt|marlowepi: strange that E did not lead a club after the ruff|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pc|c3|pc|h3|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|nt|sybarra: I suspect the bidding in the other room is not as shown,  perhaps interference by W        |pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: among other things, W asked for a club. but even if not, club seems clear|pg||

nt|Walddk7: because the Irish teams were stranded on the island|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess at the auction is 1 s-p 2c-2 ht 2 nt p 3 nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup welsh gold to the fore|pg||
nt|iain sime: 3@S was makeable, so this was as good a result as Scotland could get (apart from an unrealistic pass by Sam in 4th seat).|pg||
nt|ady: slam time|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 500 vs. 800 significant.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|ady: there are only 11 obvious tricks in hearts  but 2 ways to make the 12th|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is the game contract|pg||
nt|mug: good afternoon|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: messy hand this|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: 2@C is nat GF|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@H is where you want to land|pg||
nt|roswolf: but could/should be defeated if played by east|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S looks plausible but has its difficulties|pg||
nt|justin c: hi Tom|pg||
nt|mug: you can't really go off|pg||
nt|justin c: 6@C has its difficulties too|pg||
nt|mug: just knock out @CA and then @SAK, North can take his two trump winners at his leisure|pg||
nt|mug: ah sorry I'm in the wrong room, bye|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|sybarra: rebid of the spade suit by W?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  or kind of invite?|pg||
nt|justin c: seems inevitable|pg||
nt|justin c: @S ruff availalbe for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: ruff finesse the Q@C works   also pull 2 trumps only and play diamonds hoping if they are 4-2  the hand with 4 diamonds has the outstranding trump|pg||
nt|iain sime: Both pairs play weak NT and weak twos in the majors. NS also play five card majors and a short club.|pg||
nt|ady: may also play a minor suit squeeze which fails|pg||
nt|lark20: 2NT is Baron 15+ showing 3/4 card support|pg||
nt|iain sime: Can probably beat game by defending here. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: or just bid game  LOL|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: confused by W pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: says she took an arbitrary view and apologised if there is more|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sfoxa:  straight to game - good vulnerable approach in match|pg||
nt|ady: singleton spade lead kills the line of drawing 2 trumps only and playing 4 rounds of diamonds as it works up to then  but no quick way back to hand to draw the last trump and north ...|pg||
nt|ady: can win A@C and give a spade ruff|pg||
nt|justin c: if they dont take it, can guess the @H position to get two spades away|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: will be disappointed to only take 4 sp tricks |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|roswolf: now how accurate will the defence be?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|justin c: 2@C was GF by the looks of this|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|iain sime: This may not be best. There are eleven tricks and provided South hangs on to her diamonds England have won 13 imps.|pg||
nt|ady: no way to get the 12th trick here    other than 3-3 diamond break  or an unlikely squeeze position in in clubs and diamonds|pg||
nt|lark20: In a heart contract, could always take a ruffing finesse in clubs|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: this looks booked for -800|pg||
nt|justin c: well, this is going a lot off|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sfoxa:  interesting position in @d|pg||
nt|iain sime: My guess is that Sam placed the @S ace with North and wanted to declare with @SKQx.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lark20: Presumably she chose 6NT to protect her spades|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  @d K will block the suit for a while|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S has to duck next @c|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps even -1100|pg||
pc|cT|nt|roswolf: has to be otherwise east was overbidding wildly - she only has a 9 count after all|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: this effectively promotes another trump trick|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|justin c: as I understand things, West's pass over 4@H was encouraging East to bid on|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: will do since N will win club with q |pg||
pc|c9|nt|lark20: Sorry Ian both saying the same, but I am slower|pg||
nt|roswolf: should have overruffed|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: and beginning to give S a bit of a problem |pg||
pc|dK|nt|sfoxa:  ouch!|pg||
nt|sybarra: now has to figure it out for the up trick |pg||
nt|justin c: & west underbidding even more wildly|pg||

pc|c8|nt|roswolf: back to -4|pg||

nt|roswolf: south's last call was gambling|pg||
nt|justin c: EBU, that is|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "arbitrary" is quite a euphemism.  a frequent consequence of such decisions is that soon you have a new partner to present that explanation to|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: e/w might try 4@H HERE|pg||
nt|justin c: north hand could have been a touch more useful than it actually was|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|ady: North should have kept an extra spade and 1 less club in the 4 card ending|pg||
mb|2H|nt|iain sime: A vulnerable psyche!|pg||
nt|lark20: That is a weak opening bid especially Vulnerable|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt also made in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: S may have thought keeping the @D's was better |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this might get feisty|pg||
nt|ady: how high will south go?|pg||
nt|justin c: not pleasant against a @D lead|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: it is one thing to disrespect a force when you have cheated on your response. but there W had a full ten-count, almost the best you can have, AK & K|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzha: 1NT rebid was 15/16|pg||
nt|roswolf: east is wet in not bidding over the weak nt|pg||
nt|justin c: nothing is going to make here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: McGee in the other room,  raising for 3 seems a bit much to me  |pg||
nt|roswolf: finis|pg||
nt|ady: e/w too high and the opening bid will get the right lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry, ELEVEN, and with good spots too|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|justin c: can see it will survive on this layout (doubleton @HA and no entry to the long @D)|pg||
nt|roswolf: west might bid on with those crisp controls but selects a stolid pass|pg||
nt|copeyj: west would be mad to raise|pg||
nt|copeyj: KJ@S under the overcall and partner not good enough to bid 2@h in an acol style|pg||
nt|roswolf: 10 imps to Wales probably|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|sybarra: the East hand raised to 3 |pg||
nt|roswolf: the club 6 is a great card for declarer|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: raising to 3 seems a bit unlucky none of her Qs working and p having so much in @Cs|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|iain sime: South has respected her partner's pass- or seen her openers before. |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ady: this should be 2 down in 3 to flaten the result in OR where England were way too high|pg||
nt|lark20: I suppose she did limit her hand with the 2NT bid|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  8 points and 5-cards suit - good reason to rise|pg||
nt|justin c: wales played in 4@S on the previous board, 2 off|pg||
nt|lark20: Declarer must be wondering which opponent's bid to believe|pg||
pc|dT|nt|justin c: for a 3 imp gain to england|pg||
nt|roswolf: DIAMOND PIPS NOT BAD EITHER|pg||
pc|d8|nt|justin c: I see 7 for declarer, but no eighth|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks right|pg||
pc|dK|nt|justin c: need to play East down to just clubs, then endplay|pg||
nt|justin c: but i dont think that is manageable|pg||
nt|iain sime: They needed a club switch for two down.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: I can understand 2 but 3???? |pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  practical approach?|pg||
nt|justin c: no fun having to find discards from east|pg||
nt|marlowepi: taking ace of hearts was precipitate. how can it hurt to play low?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: Fiona would have done better to play a club after cashing the diamonds   should escape down 1 now|pg||
nt|iain sime: At trick 2 or 3.|pg||
nt|roswolf: ???????|pg||
nt|roswolf: undo i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: i cannot continue as north overruffed the diamond|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah a revoke|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: I can understand those who do raise to 3 esp. red....but still it is not as good a hand to me as to others |pg||
nt|justin c: in a difficult contract like this, keep the tension in the position|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: claim -1|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|sybarra: a nice 4 @S here |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this board looks like calm one - game straight to bid and make|pg||

nt|justin c: interesting double at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 1nt with a 12 count -sheesh|pg||
nt|iain sime: This is a Roland slam?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  can hope for a bunch of tricks )))|pg||
nt|justin c: wrongsiding NT to boot|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|justin c: think 1NT was semi-forcing, but even so, this is a view|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|justin c: @HAk in front of the @HQ, and @DAK in front of the @DQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S would seem to have the makings of a Neg X over 2H, and the P by W can only mean she was barred|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: was going to say n/s may play 4 @S X |pg||
nt|iain sime: West has shown a minimum balanced hand too strong for 1NT. With more she would have ventured 4@D (last train) over 4@C.|pg||
nt|iain sime: I hope West can justify this optimism by landing her slam.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Avram Kreisberger|pg||

nt|Walddk7: http://psbridge.gotdns.com/bbo/allvug/  - Vugraph Hand Records (PDF)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but of course NS can also save for -1|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|sfoxa:  to double was easier than to take 4 tricks|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lark20: worst lead she could get|pg||
nt|ady: dont think the lead matters here  the spade position has to be favourable|pg||

nt|roswolf: straightforward|pg||
nt|justin c: as it is, though, nothing EW can do|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: 4H could have worked, the idea is to pressure opps into bidding 4S....increases chances of scoring spade Q on defense, and 4S may simply have noi play anyway|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: must be W in the tank |pg||
nt|vugraphzha: W has tricky call here, might end up passing|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: a lot depends if they play Lebensohl here or not |pg||
nt|sybarra: if they do 3 @D can be bid with impunity |pg||
nt|justin c: 1NT - 3@C?|pg||
nt|justin c: no game making here I think|pg||
nt|justin c: but too many points not to play in one|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: guess not :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzha: they play lebensohl|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|sfoxa:  so 3@d show points, invitational values|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: for specs,  2 nt forces 3 @C bid,  and W can pass, bid a suit (suggesting pard pass) etc |pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: spade was best lead |pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: 2 nt is the weaker (relay) bid typically |pg||
nt|ady: great switch|pg||
nt|iain sime: West would have done better to lead her partner's suit. Not that one can fault a club in their four card major style.|pg||
nt|justin c: needs a @C lead|pg||
nt|justin c: and this looks suspiciously like a @S|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|justin c: seems to me east should bid over 1NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm this is strange i would never defend 1nt with the east hand|pg||
nt|justin c: must be likely that NS are headed into a major suit, why not preempt, indicate the lead, remove their stayman, etc|pg||
nt|roswolf: will west win and switch to a spade?|pg||
nt|roswolf: the trouble is that she might switch to a heart|pg||
nt|justin c: yes - i'm sure that the @H5 indicated a @S entry (dont know their methods)|pg||
nt|roswolf: but west clearly thinks it is not obvious|pg||

nt|roswolf: you cant argue with success|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: a nice time for an off shape multi|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt by north isnt absurd|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: i would probably double to show a weak nt type hand|pg||
nt|justin c: agree|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@H pass or correct is a good tactical bid|pg||
nt|justin c: it keeps more chances alive|pg||
nt|justin c: would need to guess @S, but this opening bid makes that guess pretty clear|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: wrrigglr coming up i think|pg||
nt|justin c: P, P, 3@C maybe|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|justin c: 3@h for East here, depending on what she expects to be opposite|pg||

nt|roswolf: pass as east would not come into my ken|pg||

nt|roswolf: this is murky for n/s|pg||

nt|justin c: may still get to 3NT when it is right if you bid 3@h here, but the opposite is not true|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: well this looks easy but south may fear some gremlins|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Yes, but ...|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Due to travel difficulties (vulcano ash   closed airspace), the weekend has been shortened to just Saturday and Sunday with 12 boards per segment (rather than 16). No bridge Friday ...|pg||
nt|Walddk7: because the Irish teams were stranded on the island|pg||

pc|h7|nt|roswolf: yes as good a route as any|pg||
