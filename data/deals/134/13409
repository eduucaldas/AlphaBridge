nt|ady: kind lay of the cards for e/w  can make 12 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a Roland slam - 6@D not much worse than 25% for East-West|pg||
mb|1C|an|Alert|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|dburn: but if they can get to game they will be doing pretty well in practice|pg||
mb|2C|nt|dburn: tough to bid to five of a minor when an opponent opens|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: east elected to overcall 1@D rather than double      might work well on this hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|heatherd: True, but game is pretty good.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|heatherd: There we go, no problem|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|dburn: West a card-carrying member of the "never support partner" school|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||
nt|heatherd: 4@h shouldn't have too many problems either.|pg||
nt|ady: this should not be too much trouble even though 4-3 fit|pg||

nt|dburn: indeed - may well make an overtrick, and 450 will be a top|pg||

nt|mug: perhaps you were just discussing it, but did England "find" an IMP?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|nt|dburn: could do more than that - will be a good effort to reach game at the other table, despite the ease with which East-West managed it here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dburn: not sure - score was 17-17 on BBO, but the players' cards may have differed|pg||
nt|ady: ruff a nd play a spade will likely save the overtrick|pg||
nt|ady: west could not chance playing low|pg||
nt|heatherd: will it?|pg||
nt|dburn: she has eleven tops - that spade will go on the fifth diamond|pg||
nt|ady: no sorry   of course spade goes on 5th diamond|pg||
nt|mug: David is right|pg||
nt|dburn: well, one of the Davids is right|pg||
nt|ady: you|pg||

nt|justin c: prefer 1@D myself|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed just avoid the 3nt trap is the name of the game here|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: no show the suit is right|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzha: 2@D might only be 3 as 1NT was forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: can you in Europe see the ash in clouds? |pg||
nt|vugraphzha: seems a beautiful clear day here actually|pg||
nt|justin c: easy to see a X getting into trouble|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: how does dble get into trouble?|pg||
nt|justin c: W might cue 2@C and continue with @H|pg||

nt|vugraphzha: quite rare for manchester|pg||

nt|dburn: South maintaining her average of two points per deal|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: I believe the hand is known as a Richard Sampson|pg||
nt|heatherd: Hard to get 4@h played by West here|pg||
nt|mug: Two Jacks|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: west has to be declarer if e/w play 4@H|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if East uses Stayman they may manage it, I guess|pg||
nt|mug: presumably he was a poor card-holder, David?|pg||
nt|mug: or thought he was|pg||
nt|ady: may still make played by east    still has to find a diamond lead|pg||
nt|dburn: or, if North does something like 2NT for minors, East can do something like 4@c or 4@d for majors|pg||
nt|heatherd: Would you open the East hand?|pg||
nt|dburn: no|pg||
nt|dburn: would prefer to hope to have a chance to show it on the second round|pg||
mb|2N|an|2 suited|nt|mug: you're supposed to have defensive strength to open the bidding|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dburn: if 2NT is any two suits, East does not have a clear action|pg||
nt|dburn: and 4@s is certainly not a clear action|pg||
nt|mug: so start with a double maybe|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|heatherd: 1st board was an IMP to Wales. Not a disaster for England|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you could start with a pass, and then cue whichever suit North showed at her second turn|pg||
nt|ady: why not either pass or double  and take action later|pg||
nt|heatherd: You surely want to give partner the option of either Major|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mug: even a club lead will set 4@S, South gets a late promotion|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Yes, but ...|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Due to travel difficulties (vulcano ash   closed airspace), the weekend has been shortened to just Saturday and Sunday with 12 boards per segment (rather than 16). No bridge Friday ...|pg||
nt|Walddk7: because the Irish teams were stranded on the island|pg||

mb|5C|nt|roswolf: yes as good a route as any|pg||
