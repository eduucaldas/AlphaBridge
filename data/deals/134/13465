nt|royhughes: true enough!|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|kit: Or 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|calabres: 1NT is @Cs|pg||
nt|kit: I think West had to bid 2@S, -- he knows 8-card fit.  But now he gets another chance.|pg||
nt|steveray: doubling 2@H works well|pg||
nt|calabres: 1@C opening can have 2 cards|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: And the free bid of 1N showed long clubs, Luis?|pg||

nt|calabres: yep|pg||
nt|steveray: where was east?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: The 3@H call looks nuts, particularly if 1NT shows long clubs|pg||
nt|steveray: 500 available|pg||

nt|royhughes: That's more understandable, I think|pg||
nt|steveray: always a problem situation|pg||
nt|royhughes: It's sometimes difficult when partner has so much strength in the suit you lead|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|kit: West should have returned his lowest club to avoid this problem|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think the spade lead is good for declarer, as it solves his 4th round loser|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|steveray: unless declarer plays one|pg||
nt|royhughes: So long as declarer plays on hearts after discovering the trump split, he should be ok|pg||
nt|kit: now must play on hearts -- but has to decide which more dangerous -- doubleton heart or singleton spade in East's hand|pg||
nt|steveray: the @S discard helps|pg||
nt|kit: I think after what happened at trick 1 he will get it right, and West's foolish spade discard makes it even clearer|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: 1N makes it look like  they play inverted minors.  A simple raise would have let south reevaluate immediately|pg||
nt|othered1: Inverted minors are difficult to make work effectively in a strong NT-based system, unless you add quite a bit of artificiality.|pg||

nt|royhughes: West got off to a good lead|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|steveray: it is normal to pick up the trumps|pg||
nt|royhughes: Will South make the restricted choice guess in hearts?|pg||
nt|steveray: yes|pg||
nt|royhughes: maybe it's time to play a club up|pg||
nt|steveray: so 6H+2D+1C+1S=10 tricks|pg||
nt|royhughes: That should work, but I can see why declarer is taking his time|pg||
nt|steveray: ruff a diamond and finesse hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzhj: S asking about carding|pg||
nt|royhughes: It looks like he can misguess clubs and still build his 10th trick there|pg||

nt|royhughes: I think this is what I would have tried|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|royhughes: South should be ok so long as he doesn't try the queen|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|royhughes: Now he just has to guess the trumps|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|royhughes: He may ruff a diamond to get to dummy -- he was asking about the spot leads|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|royhughes: Of course, West may play a 3rd club, and he'll ruff in dummy|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|steveray: Sofia and Jorgeare 19vps ahead so only need to avoid a large loss to win the event|pg||
nt|royhughes: West may have figured his partner would have returned a club if he started with only 2|pg||
nt|royhughes: Is there prize money?|pg||
pc|hK|mc|9|nt|royhughes: This was a surprise -- I wonder what declarer's reasoning was|pg||
nt|steveray: decent money but more in the pairs|pg||

nt|royhughes: Declarer must have had some sort of count, and was wrong|pg||
nt|royhughes: because the percentage play in trumps is certainly to finesse|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|steveray: well e/w need lots of points and here is a makeable slam|pg||
nt|steveray: needs good guessing|pg||
