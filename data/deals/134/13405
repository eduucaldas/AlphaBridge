nt|Walddk3: round 2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|Walddk3: http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2010January-July/LadyMilne/results.htm  for 1st round results|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Wales hammered by Scotland whereas England and EBU drew|pg||
nt|brolucius: Stockdale and Brown are the 'Nick Clegg' of the England women's team. |pg||
nt|brolucius: Young and fearless.|pg||
nt|brolucius: After 1@S - 1NT, North is just short of a 3@S rebid.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|an|tfr|nt|brolucius: 2@H is a transfer.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: So, North has valued her hand as a 3@S rebid (in standard bidding).|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the basis that my predictions can hardly be wrong twice in one hand, South has no reason whatsoever to bid further...|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Well, I said they were young and fearless. They have certainly both bid their hands to the limit (and a bit beyond).|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|brolucius: A witty kibitzer says that he always prefers 'old and fearsome' to 'young and fearless'.|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||

mb|1S|nt|garnetts: good morning all|pg||

mb|p|nt|jni33: Scores before last segment: http://www.bridge.dk/4554/Klub1/Turneringer/Resultat637.html|pg||
nt|oleberg: Relay precision is known in most of the world as "Wiking club"|pg||
nt|oleberg: (Where it is known)|pg||
nt|jni33: Bjarnarson-Askgaard need to win with 16 imps to win the "tournament"|pg||
nt|oleberg: Both pairs play the 1@D opening as always unbalanced.|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@S makes here, and it is a reasonably good game, declarer would need oto be lucky in one of the black suits|pg||
nt|justin c: I guess 2@S here for NS|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|oleberg: Which was the dominating method among the top pairs in the European Championship a year or to back|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S is usually the best with the south hand as she is prepared to play in at least 3@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|mikeirl: good morning all|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||

nt|brolucius: The cards lay well for declarer but not quite well enough.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi, Tom!|pg||
nt|mug: hello David|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: N/S just went down in 3NT despite holding 21 points between them.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|brolucius: Now it is E/W's turn to hold the magic 21 points.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: was  1 a natural auction?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: it had a transfer in it|pg||
nt|dburn: and a couple of slight overbids|pg||
nt|mug: can't see any slight overbids|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's advance to 3@S was perhaps more of an overbid than South's 3NT, but it was close.|pg||
nt|mug: North is a bit stuck for a lead|pg||
nt|mug: maybe a diamond, that's usually declarer's shortage on this auction|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn: well, declarer did bid diamonds|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|mug: @HA was not a bad idea, she expected to see @HK in dummy and then decide what to do|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some responders would say 1@S with four spades and four diamonds, in which case West will have only three spades.|pg||
nt|mug: now she'll probably continue the suit, hoping @H7 was from H7 doubleton, nothing else is attractive|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|dburn: some Wests might have chosen 1NT with the actual West hand, but perhaps they reserve that for 3=3=3=4 shapes|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||

pc|c4|pc|dJ|pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|dburn: although it would have meant that West had produced the @h8 from @hK86 or @hJ86 - no doubt she should, but she might not|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|s3|pc|hK|pg||
nt|mug: presumably @H7 was reverse attitude|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|s4|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mug: fair point though David, not many declarers are fast enough to play @H8 instead of @H6 when they see @H7 on their right|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brolucius: Well, that was no more or less interesting than most 1NT contracts. Perhaps we will be favoured with something better on the next board.|pg||

nt|oleberg: A true yarl|pg||
nt|mikeirl: perhaps dbl by E over2h is best T/O|pg||
mb|1C|nt|garnetts: maybe but 2NT did show 15-17--|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: 1@C is 2+|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, better for poker, at least he would have four nines :)|pg||
nt|chick: hi Marshall|pg||
nt|garnetts: an awkward hand for South to bid if North bids 1NT|pg||
nt|mikeirl: dbl is(11-14) :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  ty|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: A Yarborough is a hand with no card higher than a nine spot. The term is derived from Lord Yarborough of England, who offered a wager with odds of 1,000 pounds to one against the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: chance of any player having such a holding. The actual chance of any player holding a hand with no card higher than a nine has been mathematically equated to 1,827 to 1|pg||
nt|garnetts: if you think 3@C is a good bid then start with it---not once the opps have got things together|pg||
nt|justin c: 1NT by somebody here|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 3@C is awful in my view --poor suit and defensive values|pg||
mb|1N|nt|oleberg: And a killer in Chinese poker|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think the modern method of playing transfers over short clubs is a serious improvement|pg||
nt|justin c: seems to be very popular lately|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|justin c: the more transfers the better|pg||
pc|s6|nt|oleberg: NS plays "Nilsland", so North's pass required redouble|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|mikeirl: 3c  look  like winning  bid|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would not go that far, and I insist on being able to transfer or play the hand with the distribution concealed|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: not convinced myself - if opps intervene these methods are very fallible|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|garnetts: In what was is it a winning bid?   |pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|jni33: ohhh|pg||
nt|oleberg: Doing this, instead of bidding 2@S directly, tells the NT-opener, that he may compete to three, on a suitable hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lars will hate this lead, but the contract is still down|pg||
nt|patricck: Still not good enough. Declarer can lose only one club, but when east comes in A@S and another leaves nowhere to put the 4th @D|pg||
nt|garnetts: Directed NS into a makeable contract |pg||
pc|c6|nt|patricck: *west|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if you don't bid with E hand, what is the good hand after 1NT opps opening?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|justin c: seems to me that transfer replies are a bit double edged|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c8|nt|justin c: more options for your side, but also more for theirs|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|s5|nt|oleberg: Quite a position from South, to bid 4@S|pg||
nt|henryb:  not covering the @c10 is wrong. suppose partner has 9xxx!|pg||
nt|justin c: particularly where they get to X a 1@H bid that shows @S|pg||
pc|s7|nt|oleberg: But being behind 16 against very competent opponents, it may be ok|pg||
nt|jni33: Maybe Lars liked the lead ... when he saw dummy he was very happy not being left in 3@h dbl |pg||
nt|patricck: Even if the bidding is invitational from North his hand is not that attractive|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|justin c: where a natural 1@S bid makes things a lot less pleasant|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s2|pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: At least East has one valuable card, @D9, the Curse of Scotland|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi everyone|pg||
pc|h2|nt|oleberg: No. But NS is also much into making a good system, so there may be something we dont know|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|patricck: good play, now West must play A@S @S or it might make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But if anyone can work that out, Lars is the man|pg||
nt|oleberg: West might think declarer fears an overruff|pg||
nt|oleberg: But he is opening his communication for a crossruff|pg||
nt|patricck: West will fear that North's @D are Q9xx |pg||
nt|Walddk2: What can he do if they are?|pg||
nt|patricck: northing I guess, but maybe another @H might be right if partner has J@S|pg||
nt|oleberg: Lars knows that NS are very good, but also very gutsy. And ready to take a position, if they believe in it.|pg||
nt|jni33: Lars has the @h J in hand ... under the table ... noone else than Emil and I can see it|pg||
nt|jni33: "the little details" says Lars|pg||
nt|patricck: North really needs @S KQJxx for the bidding. playing partner to hold 9@D seems better odds than the J@S|pg||
nt|oleberg: not so obvious to me|pg||
nt|jni33: now @c A in hand|pg||
nt|oleberg: Even without the @SJ, the bids seem okay|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Small wishes come true more frequently than big ones|pg||
nt|patricck: Surely A@C can't be right? North bid out his shape|pg||
nt|oleberg: As far as I know, the sequence wasn't invitational|pg||
nt|patricck: South must have thought so because his hand was hardly a gem of a 1NT opener :)|pg||
nt|jni33: Lars asks a lot of questions to Michael|pg||
nt|jni33: "can N have 4@s and 5@d" he askes ... "I have newer seen it" is Michaels response|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jni33: @c A it is|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|garnetts: has to play for the spade to be right now--and it is |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|pc|d3|nt|oleberg: It is suggested, that East would have played a high diamond on the heart, if he wanted an uppercut|pg||
nt|patricck: Indeed that would be good defence from East. West really should have got this right, but this is the last match of a stressful event :)|pg||
nt|jni33: And the first punch from NS seems to be a "success" ... Bjarnarson is thinking |pg||
nt|jni33: The "doors" in the screen is being closed|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
mc|9|nt|jni33: Gregers is talking to Jacob -- cant hear it here -- they are on the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|mikeirl: can be tough decision|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am sorry to say that North has played that poorly in the end --gave up it seems|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|Walddk3: Cath Jagger is in 5@C next door|pg||
nt|brolucius: When a friend phones you and says that he has a great hand to tell you about from the previous evening, it is very rarely a 1NT contract.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|mug: 4@S would be normal|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|dburn: 5@c looks an odd sort of spot - 4@s seems preferable|pg||
nt|brolucius: Classic auction from the Welsh pair.|pg||
nt|dburn: still, things being what they are, 5@c might well make|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Well yes, but over 3@S Seale bid 4@C and was raised to 5|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Not sure why she did not choose 4@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S seems the clear-cut continuation. Why not?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: why not indeed|pg||
nt|mug: well bid Wales|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brolucius: Some might claim that 4@C was non-forcing after that start. You might as well be in game on the expected 5-3 fit.|pg||
nt|dburn: I suppose that 3@s might be based on something like @sAx|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mug: A-x? Do me a favour...|pg||
nt|brolucius: If so, that player has the right to revert to clubs.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dburn: but perhaps with a hand like @sAx @hxx @dAKxxx @cAQxx, West is supposed to bid 3@h rather than 3@s|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that sounds right.|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps!|pg||
nt|mug: or even 3@D, holding no help in hearts at all|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|dburn: oh, I don't say I agree entirely with East's actions at the other table - I merely seek to understand them|pg||

nt|chick: probably the operator already starting to claim :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Emil could see that the 8 was big enough, so he played that. Well done :)|pg||
nt|patricck: Big start for NS, they almost certainly have the 16 imps they need from the 1st two boards, so the winner of the event is in the balance|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2010January-July/LadyMilne/results.htm  for 1st round results|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|oleberg: Slightly off-shape take-out double, but nescesary|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: He has compensating values; double is fine|pg||
nt|chick: I rarely get better shape than that for a takeout|pg||
nt|jni33: I'll try to keep you updated with results from the other three tables later|pg||
nt|patricck: South can diagnose that there is spade shortage opposite and his own spades are rubbish, so he should have bid 5@D|pg||
nt|oleberg: North knows that South has 5 diamonds or more, unless he is marmic|pg||
nt|chick: and non vul opposite vul makes it even more attractive|pg||
mb|2C|nt|justin c: heading to 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|oleberg: I do not find it obvious that South should have bid 5@D. Other things than thrumphs may defeat games, abd partner may already have taken a position|pg||
nt|patricck: Quite right for North to pass, he doesn't want to sacrifice if South has 4 chunky spades. South is the one who can see how bad his spades are|pg||
nt|oleberg: But surely 5@D would be tempting|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I suppose West is a little strong for 2@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: i hope they are not locked into clubs|pg||
mb|3S|nt|garnetts: There a a few players that would bid 1@H on the North tickets--anyone for that?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  playing for @s ace by E - looks good|pg||
nt|henryb:  This seems like a sensible auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am always nervous when players think so long in a straightforward auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: tends to result in an imaginative call|pg||
nt|henryb:  East is not sure: partner is probably 3=1=5=4 which seems to make the @hK a doubtful value, and a void opposite partner's five card suit is never particularly good|pg||
nt|justin c: sounds right to me|pg||
nt|justin c: @HK may be no use|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: EW have "stolen" North's suits so she'll be happy to defend|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|oleberg: I think I would have sacrificed with the North hand. It seems likely,that the opponents has guessed right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Glad he is not in slam now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Think a trump lead would stand out here|pg||
nt|henryb:  that is not sensible, I think. Partner will tend to play you for a 4 card spade suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm east for me has suggested 5-5 in the blacks|pg||
nt|henryb:  more 4-5 I think, or 4-3-2-4|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: can't east still even 4-4 in the blacks with no @H stop?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: suppose so but .. i dont think it too likely|pg||
nt|roswolf: spade lead and continuation would have beaten this out of hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  luckily for E-W everything, and I mean everything sits well: @cQ onside, spades  and clubs 3-2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|oleberg: But it is okay for suoth to sell out. They have made the opponents guess, and 4@S could be off, and 6@S could be a winner.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
nt|justin c: can pitch the third @S from W on the @HK on a @S lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzha: mabye trickier if S ducked there|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|oleberg: If it was only an eight card fit, a 4-1 break can be a nuisance, even if it is four small|pg||
nt|justin c: scary contract to play|pg||
nt|roswolf: north overuffs the third spade!|pg||
nt|henryb:  does not help, Justin. the @cQ is higher than the J|pg||
nt|justin c: sry, I'm playing this the wrong way around |pg||
nt|justin c: would need to play @D to get rid of @S from East|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think north might have tried the @S lead since it guarantees -1 on the bidding if pard has the trump ace|pg||
nt|henryb:  that is a good point made by the operator. the hand would have been a lot trickier if Lane had ducked the first club|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|s4|pc|h2|pg||

nt|mug: I think Brown's double showed 4+@S|pg||

mb|2H|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|mug: pass was correct and disciplined|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mug: here 3@C is strictly competitive, it doesn't invite West to bid 3NT on any hand to confirm her heart stop and good opinion of herself|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's pass of 3@C confirms what we learnt on an earlier board - that they play 1NT over an overcall as quite strong.|pg||
nt|brolucius: East could bid 3NT with better clubs.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|mug: but it wasn't what she did|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|mug: with @CQ doubleton in the slot, perhaps she can justify her good opinion of herself :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some play the Good-Bad 2NT opposite a 1NT response and some don't.  That convention allows you to distinguish between a full-value 3@C and a stretched one based on shape. |pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: If England can (somehow) take the lead on this final board of the set, that will round things off nicely - said the unbiassed commentator.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: 2@D was not necessary, passing to see what North bid might have been a better option|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|Walddk3: Restart in about 15 minutes|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|dburn: unclear - if 2@h were to come back, West might be awkwardly placed|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Due to travel difficulties (vulcano ash   closed airspace), the weekend has been shortened to just Saturday and Sunday with 12 boards per segment (rather than 16). No bridge Friday ...|pg||
nt|Walddk3: because the Irish teams were stranded on the island|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 2@D might allow East to compete with 3@D on occasions.|pg||

nt|roswolf: scheduled reatart in 25 mins|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sharkey: 3 NT by N here?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|oleberg: Bjarnarson ponders.|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS play weak NT I presume|pg||
mb|d|nt|jni33: Board 12 has been played twice so far .... E 4@s making 10 tricks at both tables|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg: He either has to upgrade two point, for a 1@C opening|pg||
nt|justin c: a wise man once wrote that the 1NT bidder has @C on this auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm east might choose2@C|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|nt|justin c: so the partner of the doubler 'should not go there'|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: I believe that would be GF for them|pg||
nt|roswolf: BLOOD may flow|pg||
nt|justin c: assuredly|pg||
nt|roswolf: west is sharpening her axe for 2@S|pg||
nt|justin c: West will deal with 2@S|pg||
nt|justin c: ad idem|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: W giving it some thought what to do|pg||
nt|roswolf: if south has passed west should do likewise in sleep|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzha: S bid 2@S a while ago|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok now double as ethically as possible ie stand on your chair|pg||
nt|justin c: if not X, then - what?|pg||
nt|justin c: nothing else is remotely appealing|pg||
mb|d|nt|oleberg: or make a 2@C call that doesn't do the hand justice|pg||
nt|roswolf: east should wave the content card|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: This might have been a more interesting board with colours reversed|pg||
nt|sharkey: Has to work for 9 tricks I think|pg||
nt|garnetts: There is some contention as to whether 2NT here should show 15-17 if playing a weak no-trump|pg||
nt|roswolf: blood will flow|pg||
pc|c7|nt|justin c: 3NT just went off on the previous board in the other room|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|garnetts: Some experts argue that you may need to bid 2NT with say xx KJxx AKJxx  xx|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|patricck: N/S vul there is no incentive for NS to push to 5 of a minor|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think it shud David show 15-17 - Dbl of 2@H shows more points than Dbl of 1@H|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|justin c: (presumably on a @H misguess)|pg||
nt|justin c: whoever said that it would be fun clearly didnt know what he was talking about|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h6|nt|justin c: a pitch on the @C10 is no use to declarer (who has 4@H on the auction)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|garnetts: This is an onging debate with the proponents of the weak notrump--but many have given up the 12-14 notrump anyway|pg||
