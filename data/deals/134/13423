nt|jtr: Good afternoon people|pg||
nt|brolucius: England were performing moderately when I watched yesterday. I look forward to seeing the latest scores (when someone tells us what website to go to) and hearing that England now ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: has a commanding lead......|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi, David|pg||
nt|jtr: Hi DB|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told: http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2010January-July/LadyMilne/results.htm|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|woozle: although 3NT by North may fail on a club lead, and by South may fail if declarer loses the lead to East before scoring a heart trick|pg||
mb|2D|an|4 Diamonds|nt|woozle: Wow...Apparently Friel's raise shows that it was Friel's turn to bid|pg||
nt|greerm: with the systems here http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2010/ladymilneteams.html|pg||
mb|2H|nt|brolucius: Scotland lead on 59 and the two England teams are 2= on 48.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|woozle: OK...I retract that last comment now that the auction has been fixed, but 2H is still pretty aggressive|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: The raise to 2@D promises four-card support because otherwise North would have made a Support Double (with 3-card support).|pg||
nt|woozle: North must accept, with a maximum and heart help|pg||
pc|s4|nt|greerm: maybe at the vulnerability she felt obliged to show support for partner|pg||
nt|woozle: Not everybody plays support doubles after a 1D response, but (for example) playing a double to show spades looks weird when you could just bid 1S|pg||
nt|jtr: Did well to avoid a @h lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: She may have read Robson's recent column in the Times, which advocated 'raise an overcall when you have three trumps'.|pg||
nt|jtr: But the @c switch will be impossible|pg||
nt|woozle: Odd refusal to lead hearts from West...lots of layouts when you need to start the suit at trick one in order to set it up|pg||
nt|woozle: but she may come up smelling of roses...East might notice the very poor club spots in dummy|pg||
nt|brolucius: I would have led a heart, too. That makes it at least two reasons why I was not selected for this event.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|woozle: I should hope that international representatives are past getting their advice from columns aimed at beginners|pg||
nt|jtr: You didnt enter was the other?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|brolucius: I failed the medical.|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|jtr: ah|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|nt|jtr: Actually, declarer can duck a @c anyway|pg||
pc|hA|nt|greerm: @C switch not quite enough to beat this|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|hT|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s5|mc|10|nt|woozle: Yes, a club lead is only a killer from East at trick one|pg||
nt|brolucius: You will scarcely believe this, David, but I made a very slight mistake in my commentary yesterday and David Burn took more than 6 seconds to correct it! (When I queried his|pg||
nt|woozle: as is a heart|pg||
pg||
qx|c21|st||md|3SKQ7HKT3DQT653CQ9,ST54HAJ852DJ4CAT7,SAJ3HQ7DA972CK643,S9862H964DK8CJ852|sv|n|nt|h_karluk: One of the curious aspects of human  nature is that no matter how good something is, someone has to make it better. i realize that North or South could take a different action, but ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i know full well that 3NT would be reached quite often|pg||
nt|athene: yes, looks hard to avoid 3nt here, with 25 high and some long suits|pg||
nt|roswolf: do n/s really have to bid to 3nt on this one - i dont think so|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sure|pg||
nt|h_karluk: previous board buddy|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Scotland play in a 4-3 fit in OR|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes - after a double and an auction where someon might have bid diamonds - but not a girl's best firned this time|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, nicely done|pg||
nt|toobad: a well thought out hand by E |pg||
nt|othered1: Of course, the Michaels bid did help quite a bit|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|athene: of course south's hand is worth about six tricks fewer when north has @CA instead of @CAx :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Looks like 2@s for N/S and 3@c for E/W|pg||
mb|1D|nt|wilkinsona: do you pass with south Liz?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|cuttysark: No - I show my club support|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not that it would make much difference here|pg||
nt|jferg: takes a club lead to beat this I think|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|wilkinsona: unless it pushes them to 6...diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Two very conservative decisions on overcalling by North on this hand and number 31|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: i wonder what N needs to overcall 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: from west?|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|h9|nt|cuttysark: Yes, I suppose it is another slam of a sort :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...diamonds back in the pack it seems..|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|toobad: 4d 3s and 2h |pg||
nt|jferg: home now |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|cuttysark: The NI North siwtched to a spade at this point, and declarr finessed diamonds|pg||
nt|toobad: next hand|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: this hand is no exception, last time they played with 23 hcp, now better|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: declarer's basic strategy here will be "hope spades are 3-2 or there is @SJ10 doubleton"|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|athene: 3-3 sorry|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: after the pass, difficult to pick cards in partners hand to beat this|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c3|pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||
nt|jferg: initial club lead needed to come east|pg||

nt|woozle: Sproule starts with a double...I wouldn't be comfortable lest it be passed|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|brolucius: You will scarcely believe this, David, but I made a slight mistake in my commentary yesterday (as you do) and David Burn took more than 7 seconds to correct it! (When I queried ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: this torpidity with him, he told me that he had been checking on the football results.)|pg||
nt|woozle: Fawcett raises, and Friel pays tribute to her fine honour structure - KQ9x in their suit - to rebid a voluntary 3S|pg||
nt|jtr: Torpidity??????????|pg||
nt|brolucius: Sluggishness.|pg||
nt|jtr: With words like that the Mail on Sunday nis not good enough for you|pg||
nt|woozle: Sproule tries for slam, but Friel will want to retract the auction into a partscore|pg||
nt|brolucius: I would not risk it in the Mail without checking in a dictionary.|pg||
nt|jtr: Does The Listener have a Bridge column?|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S isn't a great game, especially with 3NT laydown|pg||
nt|brolucius: You could apply and see if you get a rejection. |pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|jtr: How torpiditly i get one you mean?|pg||
nt|greerm: 4@S is looking like a good game now|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|woozle: Friel hasn't worked out that her hand is rubbish, unless 4NT is to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Was 4NT meant to be natural?|pg||
nt|woozle: 6C is cold, on a lucky heart lie...but Friel won't pas it, surely|pg||
nt|greerm: Hope 6@C is to play but i suspect 6@S coming up|pg||
nt|jtr: She should pass|pg||
nt|woozle: actually, not cold...there's a spade ruff looming|pg||
nt|jtr: At least she is considering it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps she has fainted.|pg||
nt|woozle: Fawcett might work that out, too, although she might think that she's getting the spade tricks later|pg||
nt|jtr: Having heard you are commentating with $10 words?|pg||
nt|greerm: the longer Friel thinks|pg||
nt|greerm: the more i hope :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4NT cannot possibly be to play, surely? She could sign off in 4@S.|pg||
nt|woozle: Sproule's auction looks weird, investigating the spade fit and then deciding not to play in it|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe the double doesnt guarantee @ss|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, indeed. She could have started with 3@H and then advanced in clubs over 3NT.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 4@C would be forcing over 3@S, so 4@H should agree spades.|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow Well done But......|pg||
nt|greerm: singleton @s on lead|pg||
nt|woozle: Friel guesses right, and at least she's in with a chance|pg||
nt|woozle: Better than a chance if Moore leads the heart ace|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@H and then 6@C more or less telegraphs the heart void.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Having said that, South will do very well to find the singleton lead.|pg||
nt|greerm: moore wondering will the @S T lea expose her partner's holding|pg||
nt|greerm: lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, indeed. A tricky decision.|pg||
nt|greerm: will the @H A be to a void|pg||
nt|greerm: and etc|pg||
pc|c8|nt|greerm: now the spotlight on declarer|pg||
nt|greerm: must bring down the JTx in @H ?|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|woozle: Not much to try - draw trumps, ruffing hook in hearts, making if JT of hearts come down or the 2H bidder has three spades|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jtr: @ss unlikely to be 2-2 which is the only other chance|pg||
pc|c6|nt|brolucius: Burn would have you on your last comment...|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|brolucius: Unless you menat it as a joke.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jtr: He is checking his Pools results luckily|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s3|pc|c3|pg||
nt|jtr: No, no  I thought there were only 12 @ss in a pack|pg||
nt|woozle: 2-2 spades (and one on the floor) is the best chance in 6S, at least twice as good as playing for the club ace to be on the floor|pg||
nt|greerm: ah, declarer has more time now|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|jtr: Sneaking the @hJ out at an early stage|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|s2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|greerm: going shell|pg||
nt|jtr: It telegraphs the position though|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|jtr: Well done!|pg||
pc|c4|pc|hT|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|s7|pc|d3|pg||
mc|12|nt|jtr: East has played in the women's team for Ireland|pg||
nt|woozle: home...well done|pg||
nt|greerm: got to feel good after that, bad luck the english though|pg||
nt|brolucius: A huge board for Northern Ireland. Well done to them (he said through gritted teeth).|pg||
nt|woozle: Might be a long-term loser though if she keeps bidding like that as a consequence|pg||
nt|jtr: That is unusually charitable of you David|pg||
pg||

nt|roswolf: another straightforward board i think|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well done..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this time a good score for Scotland from the OR|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They have a toy - 2@D opener to show both majors. Probably wuite sound at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: can go off if played by E perhaps..|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If South finds the diamond lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be the unbid suit..|pg||
nt|othered1: was properly right-sided for two rounded reasons.  Well done.|pg||
nt|othered1: somewhat lucky 6@C here with favorable @H position and major suit squeeze to boot.|pg||
nt|jferg: did well to bid and make  6c this in the other room|pg||
nt|othered1: Neatly avoiding the hopeless 4-4 major suit fit|pg||
mb|1C|nt|nigel_k:  There is a possible 6@h on this hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Another room got to the good 3N  1@H-2@C-3N|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|cuttysark: 2@S may be spades and any other suit|pg||
nt|toobad: a robust 2H from Bunty|pg||
nt|othered1: Auction to 3N was good, as west knew partner had values in @H|pg||
nt|othered1: And NS, of course, were out of the auction after the opening bid|pg||
nt|othered1: East has a choice of actions:  pass, some number of @S, or NT.  Your action?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jferg: could we see this going for 800/1100 for a few imps pick up|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: One school of thought says West should buy NT|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt looks pretty good here|pg||
nt|athene: can't you just duck a heart|pg||
nt|athene: opps can cash only @CAKQ at most|pg||
nt|athene: now you have nine tricks if the spades come in or the hearts come in|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cuttysark: I feared that a trump lead might be tempting with this spade holding|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well I though the lead was 50-50..|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North led @HA in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|toobad: no lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: whats with all these trump leads suddenly...|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jferg: 6 spades likely now|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i think carbon copy auction in OR|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. on @DQ lead you win @DA, unblock the @SJ, and duck a heart|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  West is quite lucky that the East hand is so suitable for slam given East's pass over 2@s|pg||
nt|othered1: East has another interesting call to  make.|pg||
nt|othered1: Was double a routine negative double, or might it have been necessary to show a good hand?|pg||
mb|6C|nt|h_karluk: The important thing is 2@d GF, right?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|athene: ok i just checked - that's exactly what declarer did in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: it was played the other way up but same line|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Declarer can play to set up clubs, or to ruff a diamond. Both lines work here.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If there was no chance of a club trick, the right line would be to cash two rounds of trumps and three rounds of diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Seems to be the 'in' thing - I am not a fan|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Ace of diamonds holds it to 10 and flatens the board..|pg||
nt|toobad: big hand i expect. hence E progressing|pg||
nt|othered1: Yes, west's @C bids don't necessarily look like he's preferring his solid suit.  Maybe the 4@H cue got this headed in the wrong direction|pg||
nt|jferg: think necessary to show a good hand, cannot bid 2s as only 4 and I think 3 clubs would not be forcing|pg||
nt|othered1: what about an earlier cue-bid?|pg||
nt|othered1: like 3 or 4@H directly over 2?|pg||
nt|jferg: must be a void or singleton showing a good hand|pg||
nt|othered1: and west has, including @C support?|pg||
nt|toobad: thinking about 6nt i think|pg||
nt|toobad: 6s or 7c not a hit|pg||
nt|othered1: On reflection, a well-tuned partnership might infer the huge @C fit and secondary @S, due to cue-bid at a point where east hadn't owned up to @S length.|pg||
nt|jferg: perhaps east is thinking this is a grand slam try|pg||
nt|othered1: To t urn this congested auction into a grand slam try means you have an extremely well discussed partnership, 'cause hoping partner will go right at this level without firm ...|pg||
nt|othered1: agreements is way too risky.|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|athene: south's alternative is to go @DA, club and hope south doesn't win the first club trick - then the diamonds are protected|pg||
nt|jferg: obviously worried about her club suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sorry west's alternative|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|nt|jferg: 14/15 imps for N.I.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: but that feels inferior|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|nigel_k:  Making if diamonds are 3-3 or the short diamonds and short trumps are together|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A dummy reversal is also possible|pg||
pc|c5|nt|othered1: but she knows from the cue-bid and both NS bidding that she's facing @H void.  So when will this make when 6@C won't?|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|toobad: its not over until its over|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s5|nt|nigel_k:  Now declarer is relying on the club suit which luckily also works|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: small club must be best now... |pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|woozle: 1NT 15-17?|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@h is a fair contract|pg||
nt|greerm: some woudl make a try on the East hand some not|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|greerm: ithen probably 2NT 3H by sproule|pg||
mb|3H|nt|woozle: East might try for game, but it's not ideal, especially since every game-try is misdescriptive|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: West might have bid 4@H, I think.  Well, East has made up for it and gone on her own cards.|pg||
nt|greerm: because she feels she hasn't described the hand, she goes on|pg||
nt|woozle: Friel accepts her own invitation...to be fair, when she chose to invite, she didn't know there was a heart fit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jtr: This might be possible to make but unlikely to be made|pg||
nt|woozle: Fawcett has worked out that her partner is broke|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brolucius: Poor hand, too.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|jtr: Through an endplay on North|pg||

pc|s9|nt|brolucius: As I see it, West might have bid more but East had no cause to advance.|pg||
nt|jtr: Not high enough|pg||
nt|greerm: north will do well to duck|pg||
nt|jtr: West showed a minimum with 3@hs  Which is what she has|pg||
nt|woozle: Game is a little unlucky - four points in minor spade honours opposite the singleton|pg||
nt|woozle: If Fawcett wins this, she'll struggle for the rest of the hand|pg||
nt|greerm: knows partner has no points|pg||
nt|brolucius: If East held the @S10, she might have led towards the West holding.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Or low to the 10 now.|pg||
nt|jtr: I am sure North will get this right|pg||
nt|greerm: true david although that might have lost the @D ruff|pg||
nt|brolucius: I expect her to, as well.|pg||
nt|woozle: All true...but if she wins the queen and exits a low spade, declarer might not pitch from dummy|pg||

nt|roswolf: this is a trappy hand|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: If one of NS opens, the other hand looks quite good..|pg||
nt|cuttysark: hard to stop at a making level|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Well done by E/W |pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: q@C was a little insulting :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes declarer would never play that way with another club|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But it did end the hand faster|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|cuttysark: Playing a weak NT is it inadvisable to open light in 3rd seat - sever danger of being penalised|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  And declarer was bound to make anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|athene: 1@D overcall from north might warn EW off 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: especially when south raises diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: suddenly @DQxx is looking a little bit nervous|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2 way hook |pg||
nt|roswolf: this overcall may help e/w avoid the doomed 3nt but may welll bid to 5@C instead|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|athene: south wants to get spades into it|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: still, should avoid their diamond fit|pg||
nt|toobad: i agree Ed but we all do strange things at the table under pressure|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't have many partnerships I'm confident would work through that last hand correctly, unless they open east 1@H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and she will find a fit|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: support double?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: doubled 5@c could be a disaster|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|athene: looks as though EW play opener's double as strong notrump|pg||
nt|athene: they might play 1nt rebid there as showing 3 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: west has to restrain herself i feel|pg||
nt|athene: north will bid 2@S now perhaps|pg||
nt|roswolf: and she has:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: they do have a 4-4 fit but she does have a 7 count facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: it would be sad if opps woke up and bid a making game or something|pg||
nt|roswolf: well e/w got that one right|pg||
nt|athene: i am very surprised south didn't bid 2@D over 2@C|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I'm not fond of the light overcalls. It's reasonably effective when it works, but i personally hate the price i've to pay to use it. Givin' up sound overcalls is too great a loss ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for me. To me North's pass was better|pg||
nt|athene: when she doubles, she is taking a big risk of losing the diamond fit, just to try to get a spade fit into the picture|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup - a little suprising i agree|pg||
nt|athene: she was very lucky to be able to catch up and bid 2@D second time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: coffee break|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  E/W did well to stop low|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  4@h is not a very good contract and everything lies badly|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Even 3@h is too much|pg||
nt|othered1: 41H really isn't bad here at all.  should be bid vul.|pg||
nt|toobad: i think she just has to trust her p and take a plus in 6c..|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|cuttysark: All going similarly to the other room - not an imp has changed hands yet|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Hard for declarer to see any line to make this one|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: north's reticence is understandable - she knows EW have plenty of hcp|pg||
nt|othered1: mostly aces and kings outside, some shape and good trumps = more @H.|pg||
nt|othered1: How many more @H would be question to me.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|othered1: so I'd push the board, rather than winning a  handful of imps :)|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cuttysark: Diane Greenwood led a low heart to dummy and made 3 tricks in the suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I mean diamond - just testing|pg||
pc|d9|pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|jferg: 6 imps back on this board|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: declarer called for club but dummy played a @D and S followed with a @D, declarer with a @C and now we have the director|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: but i think south was a bit over-cautious there - perhaps if west's double was explained as strong notrump or better, she just "deduced" that her partner had very little, but if ...|pg||
nt|athene: you start working out what partner has on the basis of what opps have shown, you get stung when e.g. east has bid off nothing|pg||

mb|1C|nt|woozle: Game essentially needed one of two club finesses, with some handling charges perhaps|pg||

nt|brolucius: Must be by North, that 2@C bid.|pg||
nt|woozle: A study of contracts in world championships had 1C and 1D as the worst two contracts, averaging -2 imps/board, worse than 2NT or 5NT|pg||

nt|brolucius: 2@H shows 11-14 and four hearts.|pg||
nt|woozle: 11-16 is more common over a major, where double then NT is cumbersome|pg||
nt|jtr: 2 suit with minimum 2NT with max|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h7|nt|brolucius: Imaginative pass of 2@H. I like it.|pg||
nt|woozle: Fawcett tries for game and then dumps the first feasible contract when she decides not to move higher|pg||

nt|brolucius: I think you bid 2NT straight away.|pg||
nt|jtr: You have to i guess|pg||
nt|greerm: good start to the defence|pg||
nt|woozle: I almost forgot Friel's pass of 1C...I can't remember the last time my partner opened 1C and I passed it|pg||
nt|brolucius: West might well lead a spade from A-K or K-Q, so declarer may place a high spade with East. That leaves East with spade for only other good card.|pg||
nt|brolucius: ..space..|pg||
nt|greerm: I think declarer will prevail when the trumps 3-3|pg||
nt|woozle: Which points to heart queen and spade king as east's points, on the lead|pg||

nt|roswolf: west took a flyer in the other room|pg||
nt|cuttysark: You always feel a little silly going 4 down - but these 3N contracts either make or fail by lots|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The defence slipped up a bit there but E/W were always gaining IMPs once they stopped at the two level|pg||
nt|petepunt: poor slam but @S lying well|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  What happened in the open room?|pg||
nt|othered1: and the ruling should be?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: they went back and played a club as originally called for|pg||
nt|jferg: good chance of making 4 hearts on previous board north has a tricky opening lead, but you can endplay north after ruffing third dia  and end play them later, very interesting play ...|pg||
nt|jferg: hand|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: yes, you have a lot of losers for a 5-level bid at equal vul|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|athene: apart from anything else, there's a really big danger partner might have a monster and take you seriously, and bid six or something|pg||
nt|athene: just pass 4@S and then if partner doubles again, ok, NOW perhaps you have a decision to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|h_karluk: could West does really have a decision after 3@s?|pg||
nt|roswolf: east might double if this is passed to her but west will just bid 4@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: 2N is jacoby and West has to bid 3N with 15-17 bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: they play 12-14 1nt|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They are likely to reach slam then in East knows that West is 15-17|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|athene: 3@S non-forcing here; i assume NS play unusual vs. unusual|pg||
nt|athene: so with a forcing spade bid south would bid 3@H or something|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am quite surprised that W bought 5@c in OR, and paid -800|pg||
pc|d5|nt|wilkinsona: same sequence..|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North led a diamond and South switched to a spade - that worked well|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I hope East isn't thinking of grand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: WEST SHOULD STAND THIS|pg||
nt|athene: i think the double of 4@D should show a "strong" 2nt overcall|pg||
nt|h_karluk: overhelming, i hope mine is a fair criticism|pg||
nt|athene: so east doesn't need to double again|pg||
nt|athene: she already showed her hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Spade lead gives a trick|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this may make yet..|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, if she runs @C10|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|roswolf: even -690 will gain imps!|pg||
nt|petepunt: may not even make 6@H this early in the morning,  its an afternoon play hand! :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzgz: seems to be...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: when 2nt can be such a range of strengths, your first priority is to be able to express the good hand - much more use than emphasising diamonds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and would overthrow partner in post-mortem|pg||
nt|athene: and as a spec points out, if NS bidding is to be believed, west has nothing (north's 4@D was a good spade raise), so doubling 4@S is asking for trouble|pg||
nt|athene: basically it's just asking partner to choose between -690 and -800|pg||
nt|roswolf: the dragon doubles on principle|pg||
nt|athene: i think east is way too aggressive here and she is lucky NS didn't send this back|pg||
nt|athene: maybe they are scared of her :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: redouble the dragon - needs a very stout heart:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unpleasant guess ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i would lead a heart which is clearly one of east's suits|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it won't be easy|pg||
nt|roswolf: sandra taking her time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s doubled looks like a real success story|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks a logical play..|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: 4th highest of longest and strongest - the old fallback|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|cuttysark: But she does no now hearts are breaking so balyy, may think she just needs 2 club tricks|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  As Peter said, both spade honours are onside and I don't see an alternative line|pg||
nt|othered1: EW bought this with east's response.  NS don't have much to make, despite 23-17 HCP edge.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 'does not know...'|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|nt|h_karluk: i think declarer would be able to draw the big picture after two rounds of trumps|pg||

nt|petepunt: its one of those things people often dont consider,   but no other chance here.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||

mb|5S|an|grand slam try|nt|woozle: Moore can hardly count 13 tricks, but she could bid 5NT in case partner has a diamond trick source|pg||
nt|brolucius: A reverse facing a two-level response is forcing to game in any system.|pg||
nt|greerm: if GF South can reasonably expect other working cards, may well go for the grand then|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, if 3@c shows 11 and 3-card support 2@d must be GF|pg||
nt|greerm: good point|pg||
nt|jtr: North will reject|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: now North has to decide if the @D suit fits the bill|pg||
nt|woozle: 2D could permit playing in 3D|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's only a 5-3 trump fit, so a grand is over-ambitious (like many of the contracts that have been attempted in this match).|pg||
nt|jtr: South could bid 6@d with the K|pg||
nt|woozle: Yes, North could bid 6C waiting to hear 6D|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Sproule's 2C bid is pretty pointless when you think about it. She's so outgunned in high cards that the bid will almost never serve any purpose|pg||

nt|h_karluk: only 9 hcp as 1st seat in West or am i looking to a different page? :)|pg||

nt|athene: no chance now of setting up and reaching a spade trick (@CA is the only entry and surely that's getting taken out) but declarer can see just playing to set up a spade really is ...|pg||
nt|athene: very unlikely to work|pg||
nt|othered1: Many players seem to  have adopted the style to raise with 4, even on minimum hands.  Maybe south was giving north room to do so.  But in standard style, south is worth much more ...|pg||

nt|jtr: Please note DB|pg||

mb|p|nt|woozle: tight 4H for NS, will come down to a spade guess|pg||
mb|1N|an|15-17|mb|p|nt|woozle: Looking at the difference in evaluation - one table bid 4H, the other 2H|pg||
nt|woozle: If only there were a bid in between|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I really meant it when I said that I liked 2@C. Amazing that one North bid 4@H and the other 2@H. Suggests that 3@H was about right. |pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: I realise that it is difficult for people to work out if I mean what I say.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|woozle: There's a small range of positions where you can pick up trumps here - KT or QT with west, or KQ anywhere|pg||
nt|jtr: @s guess here|pg||
nt|greerm: close match so far, 5 imps after 21 boards|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|brolucius: My wife has the same problem. (It can be an advantage when I have overstepped the mark on occasion.)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|h3|nt|woozle: West leads a very passive club; a spade would have blown the hand|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|woozle: probably the only clue here points to getting the spades wrong - that west didn't lead one at trick one|pg||
nt|greerm: East going to have to avoid ruffing ?|pg||
nt|jtr: Cash and exit just in case|pg||
nt|woozle: If east pitches spades, that's probably the clue needed (reese's bols bridge tip)|pg||
nt|greerm: she will probably cash the @C and play 3@D first, then decide|pg||
nt|woozle: East must retain a club so that a trump exit doesn't just make it without the guess|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some Wests would have switch to a spade from @SA-x-x in the middle of the play, but rarely from @SQ-x-x.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Because they don't know who has the @SA in that case.|pg||
nt|woozle: that's a good reason for West to switch to the spade earlier, but too deep for most defenders|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: the @HJ lead this time will work a bit better :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: again declarer favorite here|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: let's refresh, defending weak 1N doubled is not easy right ? :)|pg||

pc|hA|nt|wilkinsona: right, Stephen..|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|h_karluk: then maybe in a good day they find time to revise the system|pg||
nt|athene: i believe meckstroth-rodwell have the agreement that they don't pass double of 1nt without some values - it's much easier to defend when both hands have some high cards|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: meckstroth in his book said they run to 2@C as a scramble with a weak hand no long suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: actually i disagree but you do need some more refined methods|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's the way we use in USA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: so if south ran to 2@C, north would pass that|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sure|pg||

mb|1D|nt|athene: it's always hard to show clubs these days, since bidding clubs at the lowest available level is never natural|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: surely East should have tried 2 spades first time..|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: practical bid by south|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with bidding over a weak notrump is that you actually need to be more disciplined, as game is much more likely, so you have to make it possible to bid constructively|pg||

nt|h_karluk: to open with 1@h or 1@s far more often than a five card major player. This can be advantageous for two reasons:a) it's harder to bid over 1@h or 1@s than over 1@c or 1@d b) when ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the opening bidder finds a fit responder can accelerate the bidding|pg||
nt|athene: south's decision here is whether to duck this|pg||
nt|athene: if she was 100% sure west had @SA of course she could win and play a spade|pg||
nt|athene: ducking risks a diamond switch which has its own problems|pg||
nt|athene: if you rise @DA you might have set up too many tricks for the defence|pg||
nt|athene: but if you duck, east puts a heart back and suddenly you are in big trouble|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmvthe ducking looks std|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you just duck this trick and throw a spade from dummy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: A good bridge player should bear in mind that sometimes the person you preempt is your partner|pg||
nt|athene: a) west is unlikely to find the diamond switch and b) even if she does you are quite likely to survive rising @DA|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Unless it would be the dreaded negative freebid - my idea of the worst convention ever|pg||
nt|jferg: might get too high in 5d|pg||
mb|3H|nt|toobad: the michaels should warn her off|pg||
nt|jferg: if west opened 2nt which many might it would not be long before she ended up in 4s which would not be a hit|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: NS made it hard - but so did the system|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: the defence aren't cashing three diamonds most of the time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true, however that isn't always ideal|pg||
