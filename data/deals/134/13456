mb|1D|an|prec|nt|petergill: Leading to 3NT without any entry in your hand, from KQ9xxx low is usually best, from KQ10xxx high (king) is usually best|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Another 3NT for EW ... but NS still have some bidding to do|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgp: Corrected sorry|pg||
nt|benjent: What do you open with the North hand Peter?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ady: red suits splitting nicely  n/s have 12 tricks in either red suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  will N ever be able to show his @d holding?|pg||
nt|ady: may be difficult to reach|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@S or 1@D = a matter for each partnership to decide. In the olden days, people used to pass the North cards, but not many exeptrts do that nowadays|pg||
nt|petergill: I open 1@D, unless my partnership style and agreement demands that I open 1@S|pg||
nt|petergill: and you, Ben?|pg||
nt|benjent: I think 1@d for me. With 5@h and a long minor, I like to get the major on the table, but I always feel with @s I'm the boss of the auction |pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT on the West cards is normal. You just hope (expect?) that partner will have the side suits under control, or that there will be a blockage or wrong defence|pg||
nt|benjent: Mostly, I would like to open the one partner has the best fit for, but that's not so easy to arrange :)|pg||
nt|petergill: True|pg||
nt|petergill: The play is very awkward|pg||
nt|benjent: There's was blockage on the last hand, and there's a distinct lack of defensive communication on this hand too|pg||
nt|petergill: @H6 likely to be 4th best, so @H8 will win|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: Declarer can place the key cards right now|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer is planning what to do after that|pg||
nt|andyv:  problem with @d opener in precision.... just too difficult to describe this hand...N could have bid 2@d and then shown @hs|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cicus: seems like reopening X is taken at full value by E|pg||
nt|joest: 4@h is a tad pushy|pg||
nt|petergill: Entries to dummy are in short supply|pg||
nt|benjent: The @h lead irritatingly takes out his entry to the board|pg||
nt|benjent: Various endplay possibilities ... declarer will spend some time working his way through them|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H seems rushing the auction and does north have to have 5 hearts?|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe 2@h showed 5@h and as long or longer @ds?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: South known to have @HKJ, so North must have @SQ, @CK and @DA for the opening bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  otherwise, bid doesn't make sense (why wouldn't N open 1@h?)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rhelle: indeed|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|nt|joest: if I was west and heard partner bid 4@h i'd be disappointed to go down :)|pg||
nt|benjent: Interest @d pitch ... I'd be thinking North is 5053 as a working plan |pg||
pc|h3|nt|cicus: usual procedure is allow some leeway and let doubler do the pushing|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|petergill: North covering with @SQ suggests North has @S9 - with @SQ7xxx North might duck @SJ, in case declarer has 5 spades|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|rhelle: conventional wisdowm is to play partner for around 7 points|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|dA|nt|joest: intrafinesse the heart?|pg||
nt|benjent: The @s pitch is ok for East ... now he can cash @s's|pg||
nt|petergill: Good club switch, having worked out that East is 4441|pg||
pc|d2|nt|benjent: Yes, prematurely killed one of East's endplay options (play @cA and another one late in the game)|pg||
nt|benjent: East should cash @hA at his next chance - put the squeeze on a very uncomfortable North|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rhelle: East has even less than that, so he has no reason to bid 4@h, IMHO|pg||
nt|rhelle: oh yes - very nice|pg||
nt|cicus: kibs also suggested this play|pg||
nt|joest: plus the spades lie nicely so he can roll this home|pg||
nt|rhelle: of course, seeing North have AK of D pinpoints the other honours|pg||
nt|joest: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: and N is likely to have 2 hearts rather than 3, so the intrafinesse seems indicated|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm still impressed with the speed at which he found it - not an everyday play|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|joest: a play first made famous by Gabriel Chagas in a BOLS bridge tip about 25 years ago|pg||
nt|ady: north opened 1@H CR and later bid diamonds twice|pg||

nt|benjent: North could have done a bit better by putting the @dJ on the 10, rather than taking the A|pg||
nt|benjent: snap|pg||
nt|andyv:  would seem to be an easier way to handle this hand|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20 |pg||
mb|1C!|an|could be 2|nt|petergill: East's good play was as is expected of a member of the Iceland National Open Team p|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: good save found in CR|pg||
nt|cicus: W might easily make a mighty leap here|pg||
nt|ady: e/w may buy the contract in a part score in hearts|pg||
mb|1D!|an|transfer|nt|benjent: Could North have figured declarer would have tried @c10 if he had a 2nd @c? Then he might have figured out the 4441|pg||
nt|petergill: NS with 25 HCP cannot make 3Nt but might make an unlikely-to-be-reached 5@D|pg||
nt|ady: 1@D by west shows 4+ hearts|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|benjent: Harsh that East has both @d honours|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: South did well to get our for down 1 in 3@S X in CR   must of got a heart lead    quuen of clubs dropped in 1  and got diamond right|pg||
nt|ady: queen of clubs dropped in 2|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|petergill: With a double stopper in hearts and no singletons not void, visualising that 5@d is better than 3NT (due to the weak @D's)  is almost impossible|pg||
nt|petergill: nor voids, I meant|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rhelle: X = GF, by the way|pg||
nt|petergill: the doubler at the other table got a bit lucky that his partner took all the tricks|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|benjent: South bid @c's in his auction, and his partner opened 1@h, so I guess figured the oppos had bid a tight game breaking badly|pg||
nt|ady: this may well go down 1|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|xenya: 3@C promised at least 3 cards i think, hence 5@C|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rhelle: which means that pass over 5@c = I don't want to go on|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|d7|nt|joest: how to treat north's double is an interesting partnership questoin|pg||
nt|rhelle: now 2 rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|joest: does it guarantee another call?   obviously north-south play that it doesn't|pg||
nt|rhelle: North X = GF, with no specific bid|pg||
nt|cicus: it created a GF so pass over 5@C was forcing|pg||
nt|rhelle: over 5C pass = forcing. Double would mean: I want to go on|pg||
nt|joest: thats true.  forgot that 1@c was forcing, sorry|pg||
nt|cicus: so they play pass/X inversion|pg||
nt|rhelle: they have reversed the meaning of Pass and X in that situation|pg||
nt|rhelle: indeed :)|pg||
nt|cicus: a relatively new concept, spreading rapidly|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rhelle: Yes, it seems to work very well|pg||
nt|joest: Another Eric Rodwell creation|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rhelle: the trouble is that we see these gadgets on display when operated by very fine players|pg||
nt|rhelle: and then it all looks very easy :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ady: this play may well help east to play a heart to the king rather than the normal play|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|h7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rhelle: looks South needs to woodenly continue @ss|pg||
nt|xenya: now another spade -- and N's @C9 might come into its own|pg||
nt|rhelle: my kind of defence|pg||
nt|rhelle: he know that the @h Ace (if North has it) can't run away|pg||
nt|rhelle: he also knows that North is relatively balanced|pg||
nt|rhelle: my money is on him playing the @sQ next|pg||
pc|c8|nt|petergill: The play of Bd 1 at the other table bore no resemblance to the play at our table, but the outcome was the same|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Note that surnames are not used much in Iceland although you can see them in the player profiles|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ð (special d), Þ (th) and þ (th in the middle of a word) are unique Icelandic characters. You see that special Th in Þorsteinn|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: a number of Icelandic characters were used by J.R.R.Tolkein in the construction of his Elvish alphabets |pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: well, now he can defend 3@S :) doubled |pg||
nt|henryb:  so he gets a chance to defend 3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and to add 100 honours|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  I think this comes from North choosing to double with a questionable hand.|pg||

nt|ady: north south stopped low in their 10 card fit   5@D  a good contract|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|rhelle: I think it's always 3 off if he just keeps playing @ss|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Muller waking Rudakov |pg||
nt|andyv:  NS should get to game here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|benjent: The CR played 2@h by EAST. East responded 1@h to 1@d, which I guess involved some system|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgp: Who took a long time efore passing|pg||
nt|ady: not  easy to reach 5@D   will likely play 3NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: may get a low heart lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  why is S so willing to bail out?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  I guess if they were vul they might make more of an effort|pg||
nt|ady: same auction in CR|pg||
nt|ady: surely worth 3 diamonds|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petergill: Transfer responses to fairly standard 1@C opening|pg||
nt|petergill: if so, 1@S would deny a 4 card major|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: it does|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT min bal, 2@C some form of checkback|pg||
nt|andyv:  they probably play 3@d as GF... so maybe 2N is the best invite they have with this hand|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|ady: North would surely bid on with  ace king ace outside a 5 card diamond suit|pg||
nt|ady: south passed  originally so can hardly be game forcing|pg||
pc|s9|nt|benjent: So the contract and declarer is replicated. How entertaining!|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D might show a minimum, then 2@H = 3 hearts|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|joest: well this lead solvesone problem for declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: South's strong diamond holding over East's likely long @d's suggests a trump lead might be best|pg||
nt|andyv:  true....so your 3@d bid seems pretty automatic|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rhelle: this is good bidding|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: The two-suited 2@S was no success for the Russians in the closed room, but that does not mean that it is bad. It just led to the wrong contract on this occasion|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|rhelle: he needs a big cross-ruff, me thinks|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|andyv:  either way, 2@d leaves little for the commentators:)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sometimes you pre-empt your own side|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like that, yes|pg||
nt|cicus: but N took a position there that 2@S would be better than 3@D|pg||
nt|joest: a high cross ruff impending|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I now hear that 2@S was explained as a strightforward weak 2, not two-suited|pg||
nt|joest: I was about to comment onthat as a possibility Roland but considered it too far fetched :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: lol|pg||
pc|sT|nt|joest: trump return here is best but won't be enough|pg||
nt|cicus: because you only looked at the spades|pg||
nt|benjent: The plain way to go about the hand is to try to ruff out @d's ... but that's quite committal|pg||
nt|benjent: Better to take some @s finesse first and see what happens|pg||
nt|petergill: A spec pointed out that 2@C might force 2@D, then 2@H show 3 hearts in an invitational hand|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|h8|pg||

nt|petergill: North could have put up @DQ and played a low club, to create a guess, if he knew all 52 cards|pg||
nt|andyv:  of course... but it's a follow up to your comment earlier, Roland... they don't like to play in part scores:)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Icemen love to bid|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|rhelle: lol!|pg||
nt|joest: east has described his hand quite well|pg||
nt|cicus: he has extras|pg||
nt|rhelle: now Muller will bid 1H, I think|pg||
nt|benjent: Which he would do at that stage with either @cA or @cQ|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H!|nt|rhelle: ah yes, they have reversed the 1H and 1@s bids|pg||
nt|cicus: hopefuly both of them|pg||
nt|petergill: Put your cursor on bids to see what they mean|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  likely to reach 3NT with their 25 hcp    needs some luck which they get|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N will be no problem to EW once @h suit breaks|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: so 1@s = 4+@h and GF|pg||
nt|joest: north has great hearts but lots of strength in the opponents suits|pg||
nt|joest: diamonds being a psuedo-suit :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Yes both know the correct meaning|pg||
mb|1N!|an|2!S|nt|Walddk2: I guess one can debate the virtue of that 1@D overcall|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|joest: let's see what Rudakov has in mind.  If 4@d invites a save, he'll defend against 4@h.  But if he then saves himself, I'll wonder why he didn't bid 5@d just now|pg||
nt|cicus: or a round before|pg||
nt|benjent: Spread 4@s here, with some shot at an 11 on a squeeze|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: Yes, I'm puzzled ... als by 3@s from South. 4@c seems to describe the hand better|pg||
nt|joest: I like 4@c too assuming it doesn't have some meaning we don't know about|pg||
nt|rhelle: true - who knows, maybe 3@s is a transfer to @c|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: I have their system notes in front of me, but this is too detailed |pg||
nt|rhelle: to recap: 1@s showed 4+ @h,and is GF|pg||
nt|joest: now in similar situations do the panelists here play that 4@h is weaker than pass or vice versa?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The good thing about having Muller at the table (other than he is a fine player) is that the operator won't get exhausted because he bids or plays too fast|pg||
nt|rhelle: so the pass over 4@d is 100% forcing and shows extras|pg||
nt|rhelle: actually it's a fine slam if the opps don't cash their aces|pg||
nt|xenya: you may have doubts about thec 1@D overcall, Roland, but you can't deny it has led to an interesting auction|pg||
nt|cicus: I am still of the old school of regarding the immediate bid as weaker|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D = his xxx in spades must be opposite shortage (2 or less cards), so the bid is safer than it might look|pg||
nt|ady: and club suit of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: I still wouldn't have tried 3@d ... swap the NS @d's|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: 1@H spades I presume and 1NT denying 3 or 4 spades in a minimum balanced hand|pg||

nt|joest: i thought that was the new school :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: of the 5|pg||
nt|cicus: I am not that old Jack|pg||
nt|joest: 4NT must have been something other than RKCB if north is thinking it over|pg||
nt|rhelle: I was young before this auction started|pg||
nt|joest: old school = "when I am weak I pass"|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Earlier today it showed extras and a lack of control in a bid suit|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||
nt|rhelle: the problem for North is that 1@s showed at least 2 controls - i.e. an ace or 2 kings|pg||
nt|tez: it will be hard to bid 3 nt if south would overcall with 1@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  might also be hard for S to explain to teammates -800|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rhelle: and he simply cannot believe that it is 2 kings|pg||
nt|joest: yet partner signed off over Blackwood.  Who to believe?  Muller A or Muller B?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|tez: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@h more of a mp bid I think|pg||
nt|tez: i would|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petergill: 5@C as a save would be 500 or 800. East followed the good principle of not bidding (nor doubling 4@C) when you have nothing|pg||

nt|petergill: no Helgemo - Helness for Norway|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting result in CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: EW in the CR got a tad overenthusiastic and shelled out 200 for their trouble. Rates to be a small loss for them|pg||
mb|1H|nt|benjent: Are Bocchi-Duboin-Sementa playing 3-way in the European?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I regard N-S as World Class, and *when* they err, it may lead to disasters|pg||
nt|joest: not sure what went wrong there.  Obviously it went back to the original response if it promised controls he didn't have|pg||

nt|petergill: previous round. Does anyone else play that? |pg||
nt|ady: nothing much for e/w    but surely will do better than -1600|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Looks like it, for Italy|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: I think South has to shorten his trumps as quickly as possible|pg||
nt|rhelle: which is what he is doing|pg||
nt|joest: i think east-west can come to four trump tricks|pg||
nt|joest: plus two sides|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As long as Khven does not crash partner's @HK, but why would he|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, simplest way is for E to  ruff  a @D|pg||
nt|andyv:  much better... N needed to dbl|pg||
pc|hK|nt|joest: that lets EAST elope with the small trump, right|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be a 15 imp pick up|pg||

nt|andyv:  EW did well to get away from @hs|pg||

nt|joest: will probablly ruff a club to hand|pg||
nt|joest: and make a spade play|pg||
nt|rhelle: he may want to wait with that entry|pg||
nt|joest: a 7 imp gain here via 2@h down one will let Netherlands regain the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like Jack's line. Leave that trump in dummy for the time being|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @CA, ruff a club and a spade up|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: this looks like down 3   and even doubled  would have surprised e/w when they compare that -800 is a nice swing for them|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s4|nt|tez: I'm talking about the accident in the other room|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|benjent: Is there a signal in there somewhere about the makeup of the Italian team next year? Are Bocchi-Duboin being encouraged to re-form?|pg||
nt|petergill: I learnt that idea from Michael Courtney, who never misses out on overcalling 1@S if he can. |pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: Even I, resistant to change as I am, have been converted (in 2010) to playing these transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|rhelle: lead a trump?|pg||
nt|benjent: I play them, playing a version of Fantunes, but I don't think they're a great idea in a natural system|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 1@H is often a balanced minimum with 3 hearts|pg||
nt|petergill: No, I had just bid badly (was I used to do), doubling 2@H on my 4225, and he was the one who went minus 800 in 3@DX|pg||
pc|hK|nt|joest: well here's a big swing back and this time I KNOW it's going to the Netherlands! :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm not so sure ... he really should have led a trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even on that lead declarer is in deep trouble|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, this will teach him not to intervene over a stron @c|pg||
nt|xenya: vulnerable|pg||
nt|joest: I think everyone would intervene over a strong club with THIS hand -- to be fair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Dirk should change his explanation over 1NT as "No place to play" :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: same dilemma as yesterday - if he finesses and it loses, he may never see th @s Ace|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c6|nt|petergill: as I used to do|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: on heart lead as well can only make 8 in no-trumps|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|benjent: Good way to learn the idea though :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|joest: why heart pitches instead of clubs?|pg||
nt|rhelle: he'll try and ruff @cs in dummy|pg||
pc|c8|nt|joest: hmm|pg||
nt|joest: what chance that will happen?|pg||
nt|rhelle: somewhere between slim and none|pg||
nt|joest: but if lho had the ten ofhearts third you might score a heart trick on power|pg||
nt|xenya: all of them are losers so doesnt really matter it seems|pg||
nt|rhelle: perhaps - you sure he wouldn't be trump short before that @h is established?|pg||
nt|rhelle: I like this better - it forces defenders to play trumps|pg||
nt|joest: I wouldn't mind getting tapped|pg||
nt|joest: if opps hearts are 3-3 I might score another|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm with declarer on this one|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|rhelle: now a low @d?|pg||

nt|tez: natural way play @s and @s|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d8|nt|joest: in the meantime the club spots are developing quite nicely for declarer after north understandably rose with the king|pg||
nt|joest: but on another club south rises, puts partner in with the heart ace and its stilldown 3|pg||
nt|rhelle: it's still going to be a bit of a train wreck - close to a swimming pool score|pg||
pc|c7|nt|benjent: So the reason I'm not keen on transfer responses to 1@c in a natural(ish) system is that you hand an extra bid to the opponents, but the gain for your side is marginal|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petergill: Slightly awkward discard for South|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Finally, our gratitude to the NBB (Marc van Beijsterveldt) and the sponsor, Hans Melchers, for ensuring that this quality match was brought to BBO. Much appreciated by bridge fans ...|pg||

nt|vugraphzgp: So for all the people who want to enjoy the lovely scenery may 23rd The Onstein Pinkster Patton|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: 2@d = multi most likely.  A weak two in either major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt that they will take the save|pg||
nt|joest: I agree Roland. the auction will time out differently|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was different in the other room where West passed initially|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry. W opened -- that will make a difference i think|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, West won't bid anymore after having set out his stall|pg||
nt|joest: and East is most definitely not in save mode|pg||
nt|xenya: but E might?|pg||
nt|rhelle: and East is too balanced with too much defence|pg||
nt|joest: if my partner saved in 5@h I would set him up with a psychiatrist :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Muller is missing a bidding card again he starts to order them|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|tez: 2@h enuf for me|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT?|pg||
mb|d|nt|petergill: For intermedaite players: the declarer play technique of that hand was interesting, the diamonds can wait, try the spades first |pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: One sensible option 3NT|pg||
mb|3S|nt|benjent: Slightly nervy in 3NT here as you try to diagnose the @d layout|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|joest: so Netherlands would appear to grab victory here on this last board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Play finished in the closed room but no score entered on board 12|pg||
nt|rhelle: this will be quick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Perhaps one of our spectators was there to see?|pg||
nt|cicus: he hides one before each board to leave himself more time to think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S down 3 undoubled I am told|pg||
nt|rhelle: that another 11|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: Less nervy 2@d|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D is fairly conservative|pg||
nt|benjent: Some marriages wouldn't survive that bid :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S at the other table would have shown 3 hearts and 6+ @d's|pg||
nt|petergill: which is ideal|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: So that's 12 IMPs to Russia|pg||
nt|ady: problem with double   is it is unlikely partner can bid 3NT when that is the right contract|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: Maybe 11, right|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: I am told you are rigth Wald|pg||
nt|ady: fell on their feet|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: the problem with 11D - 11H - 3@D - 3NT is that you can miss a good 5-3 heart fit (on other layouts)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
pc|sK|nt|benjent: Gazzilli is another pathway to solving these hands|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D - 1@H - 3@D - 3NT I mean|pg||
nt|petergill: East might have underbid to avoid this problem, to leave space to find hearts|pg||
nt|benjent: So 1@d-1@h-2@c if you play it that way (I do), then West does his "ok hand" thing and East can get his hand across|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|ady: 3NT by south is a grey area    could be 16 pts   could be what he has   and could be more than what he has|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|petergill: Still, AKJ10xxx and an ace will be 8 tricks often, so 2@D on such a suit is not my first choice|pg||

nt|cicus: apology break|pg||
nt|petergill: Those who play 2@D opening as 18-19 balanced can use 1@D - 1@H - 2NT (no longer needed as natural) as the 3@H and 6@D problem hand|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Running scores at http://www.bridge.is/results/|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|benjent: yup, there's a lot of ways to skin a cat|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|an|transfer|nt|rhelle: because 1H = 11-15, pass can be stronger than normal|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT in CR   not really any chance on a heart lead|pg||
mb|2H|nt|cicus: I thought it was forcing...|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: My partner and I play 1@D - 1@H - 2@S (or 1@D - 1@S - 3@H - a bit high, not ideal) as 3 card major support and 6+@D|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|benjent: Sure, useful method|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: 4@D looks an overbid to me -- W could be weaker i'm sure|pg||
nt|xenya: *4@S|pg||
nt|rhelle: well, 4 trumps, singleton, 5-card suit ... I like it|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|cicus: my thoughts as well|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C bid - like it or loathe it?|pg||
nt|benjent: choke, cough, splutter|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petergill: Plus side for 2@C = at fav vul, opponents often try to steal from you by opening light and responding light - so you might have 3NT on|pg||
nt|benjent: I bet North was wishing he'd passed 2@cX out when partner bid 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: yes that is what he said when he put down dummy|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|joest: 3@h is reasonable or perhaps even 3@c assuming it must be fit showing|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, that's what i meant|pg||
nt|rhelle: vulnerable game, just bid it|pg||
nt|cicus: I would not dare to try 3@C but I like 3@H|pg||
nt|cicus: I like 4@S as well|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|petergill: Minus side of 2@C = vulnerabiltiy is scary, might go minus 1100, 5332 shape is poor, suit quality falls away (bad pips)|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C response was transfer back to diamonds   showing a weak raise  presumable a 2 diamond immediate support would have been constructive|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s9|pg||
nt|benjent: And the extra values means your 1100 is likely to be against ... a partscore|pg||
nt|petergill: and even on the actual hand, North didn't pass South's Dbl, fearing that South might have a singleton club|pg||
nt|benjent: Even so, how bad could it be? 180?|pg||
nt|petergill: North is very weak, so 380 is possible|pg||
nt|benjent: Even on the dud @sQ lead, 2@c gets carted|pg||
nt|benjent: Ahem. Please prepare for the sermon. If North didn't like his hand enough to keep on bidding it like an opening hand, then he shouldn't have started out with an opening bid|pg||
nt|petergill: South's attack on spades might be an attempt to put the opponents off from attacking spades themselves (on other layouts)|pg||
nt|petergill: Ben's point is very good|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|benjent: Caught a handy switch too, with the @s play|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s4|pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
nt|petergill: South doesn't know that hearts are friendly, hence his long thinking|pg||
pc|c4|nt|benjent: How do EW play a 1NT overcall instead of 2@c? |pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|petergill: East's reverse count @S6 (or eprhaps it was a Smith Echo?) perhaps guided South to this line of play|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c5|nt|benjent: If strong, then South knows the @hQ is with East|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rhelle: well played|pg||
nt|petergill: Oops |pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: it is true that playing limited openers S can pass with a better hand than in standard. the question is whether he SHOULD, esp at these colors. most players who use these methods ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would bid with S hand, I think, to keep EW a bit more in the dark and delay their entry into the auction|pg||
pc|c6|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: south's reasoning at the end was that without @HQ, West might not have overcalled|pg||
nt|tez: 1nt(14/16)|pg||
nt|ady: another part score hand   20-20|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: true - but in their system, over a major that is almost impossible|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead best|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cicus: partner is not going to be carried away|pg||
nt|rhelle: as everything has a specialised meaning|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl of 1@D = 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|benjent: yeah, but if North comes down to @hKJ and @cJ10, then the last @s squeezes a little @h out of West and at the end he then knows for sure to drop the @hQ|pg||
pc|d9|nt|petergill: Dbl of 1@S = Support Dbl, showing 3 hearts|pg||
pc|dT|nt|cicus: even 1NT?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rhelle: i.e. over 1@h, 1@s = relay, 1NT shows @s, 2@c = any invite, etc|pg||
nt|cicus: that puts it in different light|pg||
nt|rhelle: it's easier over 1@d, as 1@h and 1@s are 6-12 and F1R - offes much more scope for messing around|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: in fact a heart lead could have held this to 7 tricks on perfect defence|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|tez: plus 1 now|pg||
nt|tez: still @d best|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: My Aussie partnership plays exactly the same methods - let's see, we got the methods from Ishmael Delmonte, who got them from Andrew Robson in England I think, and the English and ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Scandinavian top players know each other well, so there might be a link |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||
pc|c8|nt|benjent: horrible layout for declarer - and he knows it too|pg||

pc|c6|nt|benjent: hmmm ... I would have thought @dJ was clearly for a @c|pg||
nt|petergill: Why did West bid 2@H instead of 1NT? I don't know. |pg||
nt|petergill: His lack of a @D stopper put him off|pg||
nt|benjent: That would be partner's job :)|pg||
nt|petergill: @DJ was meant to be low - suit pref = don't play spades - but perhaps it was misinterpreted|pg||
nt|benjent: looks like it ... but without @dQ, @dJ is a loopy switch - surely he had some high pip he could have used instead|pg||
nt|petergill: If he can see all 52 cards, he plays @SA then a @D, but .....|pg||
nt|petergill: how can West tell that North doesn't not have another heart?|pg||
nt|benjent: Maybe @hQ now|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d3|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c7|nt|benjent: now that was a very sucess play. well done|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: South's @C2 then @CJ - reverse count - showed 2 clubs!|pg||
pc|d7|pc|sT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rhelle: north is throwing distribution - high-low = odd|pg||
nt|benjent: he's essentially played North to be 5206|pg||

nt|benjent: Anyway, North could have been 3424 ... but perhaps count signals gave away the layout|pg||

mb|p|pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|benjent: I'm not enthusiastic about North's X of 2@c. Gives away information for an unlikely gain|pg||
nt|petergill: EW seem to be heading towards the cold 3NT|pg||

nt|benjent: South's X of 2@d I understand ... get partner off what looks likely to be a dud @c lead, point the way and all that|pg||
nt|petergill: I agree with Ben - lead-directing doubles can be overdone |pg||
nt|ady: now no need to ruff a heart in dummy|pg||

pc|sT|nt|petergill: 2@CXX would have been a huge score for EW, as the cards lie - but South would run to 2@D to save the day|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|petergill: You put your cursor on the bids to see what the bids mean|pg||
nt|benjent: Gazzilli is one of those methods where everyone starts the same and then rapidly diverges|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|benjent: Luckily North got his X in, or South would have had no idea what to lead :)|pg||
