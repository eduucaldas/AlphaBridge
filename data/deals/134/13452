mb|1N|an|15-18|nt|benjent: Another 3NT for EW ... but NS still have some bidding to do|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3N|nt|vugraphzgp: Corrected sorry|pg||
nt|benjent: What do you open with the North hand Peter?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|petergill: 1@S or 1@D = a matter for each partnership to decide. In the olden days, people used to pass the North cards, but not many exeptrts do that nowadays|pg||
nt|petergill: I open 1@D, unless my partnership style and agreement demands that I open 1@S|pg||
nt|petergill: and you, Ben?|pg||
nt|benjent: I think 1@d for me. With 5@h and a long minor, I like to get the major on the table, but I always feel with @s I'm the boss of the auction |pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT on the West cards is normal. You just hope (expect?) that partner will have the side suits under control, or that there will be a blockage or wrong defence|pg||
nt|benjent: Mostly, I would like to open the one partner has the best fit for, but that's not so easy to arrange :)|pg||
nt|petergill: True|pg||
nt|petergill: The play is very awkward|pg||
nt|benjent: There's was blockage on the last hand, and there's a distinct lack of defensive communication on this hand too|pg||
nt|petergill: @H6 likely to be 4th best, so @H8 will win|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d4|nt|benjent: Declarer can place the key cards right now|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer is planning what to do after that|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|cicus: seems like reopening X is taken at full value by E|pg||
nt|joest: 4@h is a tad pushy|pg||
nt|petergill: Entries to dummy are in short supply|pg||
nt|benjent: The @h lead irritatingly takes out his entry to the board|pg||
nt|benjent: Various endplay possibilities ... declarer will spend some time working his way through them|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|petergill: South known to have @HKJ, so North must have @SQ, @CK and @DA for the opening bid|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rhelle: indeed|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h9|nt|joest: if I was west and heard partner bid 4@h i'd be disappointed to go down :)|pg||
nt|benjent: Interest @d pitch ... I'd be thinking North is 5053 as a working plan |pg||
pc|hK|nt|cicus: usual procedure is allow some leeway and let doubler do the pushing|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petergill: North covering with @SQ suggests North has @S9 - with @SQ7xxx North might duck @SJ, in case declarer has 5 spades|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|rhelle: conventional wisdowm is to play partner for around 7 points|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|joest: intrafinesse the heart?|pg||
nt|benjent: The @s pitch is ok for East ... now he can cash @s's|pg||
nt|petergill: Good club switch, having worked out that East is 4441|pg||
pc|dT|nt|benjent: Yes, prematurely killed one of East's endplay options (play @cA and another one late in the game)|pg||
nt|benjent: East should cash @hA at his next chance - put the squeeze on a very uncomfortable North|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rhelle: East has even less than that, so he has no reason to bid 4@h, IMHO|pg||
nt|rhelle: oh yes - very nice|pg||
nt|cicus: kibs also suggested this play|pg||
nt|joest: plus the spades lie nicely so he can roll this home|pg||
nt|rhelle: of course, seeing North have AK of D pinpoints the other honours|pg||
nt|joest: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: and N is likely to have 2 hearts rather than 3, so the intrafinesse seems indicated|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm still impressed with the speed at which he found it - not an everyday play|pg||
pc|d2|nt|joest: a play first made famous by Gabriel Chagas in a BOLS bridge tip about 25 years ago|pg||

nt|benjent: North could have done a bit better by putting the @dJ on the 10, rather than taking the A|pg||
nt|benjent: snap|pg||
mb|2H|an|could be 5|nt|petergill: East's good play was as is expected of a member of the Iceland National Open Team p|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: good save found in CR|pg||
nt|cicus: W might easily make a mighty leap here|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Could North have figured declarer would have tried @c10 if he had a 2nd @c? Then he might have figured out the 4441|pg||
nt|petergill: NS with 25 HCP cannot make 3Nt but might make an unlikely-to-be-reached 5@D|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|benjent: Harsh that East has both @d honours|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: With a double stopper in hearts and no singletons not void, visualising that 5@d is better than 3NT (due to the weak @D's)  is almost impossible|pg||
nt|petergill: nor voids, I meant|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rhelle: X = GF, by the way|pg||
nt|petergill: the doubler at the other table got a bit lucky that his partner took all the tricks|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|benjent: South bid @c's in his auction, and his partner opened 1@h, so I guess figured the oppos had bid a tight game breaking badly|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: 3@C promised at least 3 cards i think, hence 5@C|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rhelle: which means that pass over 5@c = I don't want to go on|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
nt|joest: how to treat north's double is an interesting partnership questoin|pg||
nt|rhelle: now 2 rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|joest: does it guarantee another call?   obviously north-south play that it doesn't|pg||
nt|rhelle: North X = GF, with no specific bid|pg||
nt|cicus: it created a GF so pass over 5@C was forcing|pg||
nt|rhelle: over 5C pass = forcing. Double would mean: I want to go on|pg||
nt|joest: thats true.  forgot that 1@c was forcing, sorry|pg||
nt|cicus: so they play pass/X inversion|pg||
nt|rhelle: they have reversed the meaning of Pass and X in that situation|pg||
nt|rhelle: indeed :)|pg||
nt|cicus: a relatively new concept, spreading rapidly|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rhelle: Yes, it seems to work very well|pg||
nt|joest: Another Eric Rodwell creation|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|rhelle: looks South needs to woodenly continue @ss|pg||
nt|xenya: now another spade -- and N's @C9 might come into its own|pg||
nt|rhelle: my kind of defence|pg||
nt|rhelle: he know that the @h Ace (if North has it) can't run away|pg||
nt|rhelle: he also knows that North is relatively balanced|pg||
nt|rhelle: my money is on him playing the @sQ next|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Þ|pg||
nt|woozle: not working for me...are there fancy alphabet settings somewhere?|pg||
nt|woozle: Another tough hand...NS are cold for 5D, but 3NT is attractive and down on a heart lead, unless East leads low|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: N/S 1@c = 15+HP 1@d=10-14 4@s 1@h=10-14 4@h or 14-17 5@h+ 1@s=10-14 5@s+ 1nt= 12-14|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk5: Thanks Jóhann|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|woozle: Shapeless double from Omar...not to everybody's taste, but it might serve him well this deal|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|woozle: Sveinn will probably drive to game, although 3NT is flawed (only one heart stopper and a weak suit) and his values might not be enough for 5D|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Jon doubles 3NT, slightly aggressively given that he has no idea what to lead|pg||
mb|p|pc|h9|nt|woozle: High stakes...a heart lead is +500, anything else is -750...looks like it's 500 for the defense, and an excellent start for EW|pg||

nt|vugraphzgp: Muller waking Rudakov |pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: The CR played 2@h by EAST. East responded 1@h to 1@d, which I guess involved some system|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|vugraphzgp: Who took a long time efore passing|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|petergill: Transfer responses to fairly standard 1@C opening|pg||
nt|petergill: if so, 1@S would deny a 4 card major|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: it does|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT min bal, 2@C some form of checkback|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: So the contract and declarer is replicated. How entertaining!|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D might show a minimum, then 2@H = 3 hearts|pg||
pc|h5|nt|joest: well this lead solvesone problem for declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: South's strong diamond holding over East's likely long @d's suggests a trump lead might be best|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rhelle: this is good bidding|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The two-suited 2@S was no success for the Russians in the closed room, but that does not mean that it is bad. It just led to the wrong contract on this occasion|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|rhelle: he needs a big cross-ruff, me thinks|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: Sometimes you pre-empt your own side|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like that, yes|pg||
nt|cicus: but N took a position there that 2@S would be better than 3@D|pg||
nt|joest: a high cross ruff impending|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I now hear that 2@S was explained as a strightforward weak 2, not two-suited|pg||
nt|joest: I was about to comment onthat as a possibility Roland but considered it too far fetched :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: lol|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|joest: trump return here is best but won't be enough|pg||
nt|cicus: because you only looked at the spades|pg||
nt|benjent: The plain way to go about the hand is to try to ruff out @d's ... but that's quite committal|pg||
nt|benjent: Better to take some @s finesse first and see what happens|pg||
nt|petergill: A spec pointed out that 2@C might force 2@D, then 2@H show 3 hearts in an invitational hand|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|joest: yes, instead of looking at south's frame of mind :)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|benjent: The problem with this line is that you don't have a whole heap of options left when it doesn't work|pg||
nt|petergill: Can South tell that a spade is best?|pg||
nt|benjent: @s9 is best best|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: 2@C forces 2@D|pg||
nt|benjent: He knows declarer is 3424 or 4423 |pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I guess one can debate the virtue of that 1@D overcall|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|joest: let's see what Rudakov has in mind.  If 4@d invites a save, he'll defend against 4@h.  But if he then saves himself, I'll wonder why he didn't bid 5@d just now|pg||
nt|cicus: or a round before|pg||
nt|benjent: Spread 4@s here, with some shot at an 11 on a squeeze|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: Yes, I'm puzzled ... als by 3@s from South. 4@c seems to describe the hand better|pg||
nt|joest: I like 4@c too assuming it doesn't have some meaning we don't know about|pg||
nt|rhelle: true - who knows, maybe 3@s is a transfer to @c|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: I have their system notes in front of me, but this is too detailed |pg||
nt|rhelle: to recap: 1@s showed 4+ @h,and is GF|pg||
nt|joest: now in similar situations do the panelists here play that 4@h is weaker than pass or vice versa?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The good thing about having Muller at the table (other than he is a fine player) is that the operator won't get exhausted because he bids or plays too fast|pg||
nt|rhelle: so the pass over 4@d is 100% forcing and shows extras|pg||
nt|rhelle: actually it's a fine slam if the opps don't cash their aces|pg||
nt|xenya: you may have doubts about thec 1@D overcall, Roland, but you can't deny it has led to an interesting auction|pg||
nt|cicus: I am still of the old school of regarding the immediate bid as weaker|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D = his xxx in spades must be opposite shortage (2 or less cards), so the bid is safer than it might look|pg||

nt|vugraphzgp: Earlier today it showed extras and a lack of control in a bid suit|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rhelle: the problem for North is that 1@s showed at least 2 controls - i.e. an ace or 2 kings|pg||

nt|xenya: good save in other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Finally, our gratitude to the NBB (Marc van Beijsterveldt) and the sponsor, Hans Melchers, for ensuring that this quality match was brought to BBO. Much appreciated by bridge fans ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D!|an|unbal|nt|joest: 2@d = multi most likely.  A weak two in either major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt that they will take the save|pg||
nt|joest: I agree Roland. the auction will time out differently|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was different in the other room where West passed initially|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry. W opened -- that will make a difference i think|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, West won't bid anymore after having set out his stall|pg||
nt|joest: and East is most definitely not in save mode|pg||
nt|xenya: but E might?|pg||
nt|rhelle: and East is too balanced with too much defence|pg||
nt|joest: if my partner saved in 5@h I would set him up with a psychiatrist :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Muller is missing a bidding card again he starts to order them|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: For intermedaite players: the declarer play technique of that hand was interesting, the diamonds can wait, try the spades first |pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|benjent: Slightly nervy in 3NT here as you try to diagnose the @d layout|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|joest: so Netherlands would appear to grab victory here on this last board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Play finished in the closed room but no score entered on board 12|pg||
nt|rhelle: this will be quick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Perhaps one of our spectators was there to see?|pg||
nt|cicus: he hides one before each board to leave himself more time to think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S down 3 undoubled I am told|pg||
nt|rhelle: that another 11|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: Less nervy 2@d|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D is fairly conservative|pg||
nt|benjent: Some marriages wouldn't survive that bid :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S at the other table would have shown 3 hearts and 6+ @d's|pg||
nt|petergill: which is ideal|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: So that's 12 IMPs to Russia|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: Maybe 11, right|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: I am told you are rigth Wald|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: the problem with 11D - 11H - 3@D - 3NT is that you can miss a good 5-3 heart fit (on other layouts)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|benjent: Gazzilli is another pathway to solving these hands|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D - 1@H - 3@D - 3NT I mean|pg||
nt|petergill: East might have underbid to avoid this problem, to leave space to find hearts|pg||
nt|benjent: So 1@d-1@h-2@c if you play it that way (I do), then West does his "ok hand" thing and East can get his hand across|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petergill: Still, AKJ10xxx and an ace will be 8 tricks often, so 2@D on such a suit is not my first choice|pg||

nt|cicus: apology break|pg||
nt|petergill: Those who play 2@D opening as 18-19 balanced can use 1@D - 1@H - 2NT (no longer needed as natural) as the 3@H and 6@D problem hand|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|benjent: yup, there's a lot of ways to skin a cat|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|rhelle: because 1H = 11-15, pass can be stronger than normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I thought it was forcing...|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|benjent: Sure, useful method|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 4@D looks an overbid to me -- W could be weaker i'm sure|pg||
nt|xenya: *4@S|pg||
nt|rhelle: well, 4 trumps, singleton, 5-card suit ... I like it|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: my thoughts as well|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C bid - like it or loathe it?|pg||
nt|benjent: choke, cough, splutter|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: Plus side for 2@C = at fav vul, opponents often try to steal from you by opening light and responding light - so you might have 3NT on|pg||
nt|benjent: I bet North was wishing he'd passed 2@cX out when partner bid 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: yes that is what he said when he put down dummy|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|joest: 3@h is reasonable or perhaps even 3@c assuming it must be fit showing|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, that's what i meant|pg||
nt|rhelle: vulnerable game, just bid it|pg||
nt|cicus: I would not dare to try 3@C but I like 3@H|pg||
nt|cicus: I like 4@S as well|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|petergill: Minus side of 2@C = vulnerabiltiy is scary, might go minus 1100, 5332 shape is poor, suit quality falls away (bad pips)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s6|pg||
nt|benjent: And the extra values means your 1100 is likely to be against ... a partscore|pg||
nt|petergill: and even on the actual hand, North didn't pass South's Dbl, fearing that South might have a singleton club|pg||
nt|benjent: Even so, how bad could it be? 180?|pg||
nt|petergill: North is very weak, so 380 is possible|pg||
nt|benjent: Even on the dud @sQ lead, 2@c gets carted|pg||
nt|benjent: Ahem. Please prepare for the sermon. If North didn't like his hand enough to keep on bidding it like an opening hand, then he shouldn't have started out with an opening bid|pg||
nt|petergill: South's attack on spades might be an attempt to put the opponents off from attacking spades themselves (on other layouts)|pg||
nt|petergill: Ben's point is very good|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||

pc|h3|nt|benjent: How do EW play a 1NT overcall instead of 2@c? |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|petergill: East's reverse count @S6 (or eprhaps it was a Smith Echo?) perhaps guided South to this line of play|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: it is true that playing limited openers S can pass with a better hand than in standard. the question is whether he SHOULD, esp at these colors. most players who use these methods ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would bid with S hand, I think, to keep EW a bit more in the dark and delay their entry into the auction|pg||

nt|rhelle: as everything has a specialised meaning|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl of 1@D = 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|benjent: yeah, but if North comes down to @hKJ and @cJ10, then the last @s squeezes a little @h out of West and at the end he then knows for sure to drop the @hQ|pg||
mb|2H|nt|petergill: Dbl of 1@S = Support Dbl, showing 3 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: even 1NT?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: i.e. over 1@h, 1@s = relay, 1NT shows @s, 2@c = any invite, etc|pg||

nt|petergill: @DJ was meant to be low - suit pref = don't play spades - but perhaps it was misinterpreted|pg||

pc|h2|nt|benjent: So the @h lead is fine, but West will need to switch a @s rather than clear the @h's if South ducks a few|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|petergill: South played @H5 at Trick 1, so @H4 lead if 4th best must be KQ64|pg||
pc|h7|nt|joest: South might have taken a swing at 3NT.  They are probably not making overtricks and if they are down 2, double shows a big profit|pg||
nt|rhelle: South has seen North's 3rd hand openings before|pg||
nt|joest: but of 1NT?|pg||
nt|cicus: although the lead cost a trick it also helped to establish N's suit to which he has tehe required 2 entries|pg||

nt|benjent: Gazzilli is one of those methods where everyone starts the same and then rapidly diverges|pg||
