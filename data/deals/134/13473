nt|Walddk3: 2@H or 2NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: or even 2@D perhaps|pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, Brink - Drijver's 2@d would have shown clubs|pg||
nt|rhelle: I prefer not to bid at all|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Excellent choice|pg||
nt|rhelle: awful choice|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@d looks the most fluid|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Peter, what do you rebid with the Eat cards?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: East  even|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2NT is really horrible - you're very likely to end up in an unmakeable contract|pg||
nt|petergill: I think I would bid 2@H, though I don't like the idea of spade overruffs if dummy has a doubleton spade|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|rhelle: in this case, bidding 2@d would llow partner to bid 2@h - which you can gratefully pass|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H has some chance to make, unlike 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk3: If you are going to invite with the West hand, you have 2NT and 3@H available, knowing that partner may only have five hearts as is the case here|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Now, is 2NT better than 3@H?|pg||
nt|rhelle: ugh - you're asking hard questions today :)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H is normal, since if 3NT is on, partner can bid it from his side (best) with a spade holding like Qxx or Qx or AJx|pg||
nt|Walddk3: That's why you are here|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk3: You are supposed to tell the audience|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|petergill: That's why at the other table, Sjoert Brink and Bas Drijver have switched 2@C and 2@D in this auction - to put the overcaller on lead.  |pg||
nt|rhelle: Brink / Drijver's competitive agreements are very well developed. Most people would make so many mistakes that the benefits would disappear|pg||
nt|rhelle: but they seem to do very well with them|pg||
nt|petergill: The Brink - Drijver idea is: if you are responder and there are two sutis that can be bid at the two level (not at the one or three level), you switch their meaning|pg||
nt|petergill: It's so simple to play this that my partnership (Gosney - Gill, won Aussie Open Trials recently) plays it too. |pg||
nt|petergill: It has to be farily simple for me to play it, or else I get confused|pg||
nt|petergill: Back to the play - @SK was right, so that any spade ruffs are "ruffing air" rather than ruffing a winner.|pg||
nt|rhelle: Muller is pretty certain partner's @s9 was a singleton - they play reverse count|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|petergill: Declarer first set up his diamond ruff, then|pg||
nt|rhelle: and no doubt he was considering continuing @d to try and protect his partner's @h holding|pg||
nt|petergill: played a club up before taking his @D ruff, which could wait|pg||
nt|rhelle: but a trump was also possible - tough situation|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Declarer's shape is known to both defenders now|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s3|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: indeed - this auction is much more likely to end in a decent spot|pg||
mb|p|pc|c7|nt|Walddk3: I prefer a 2@S preference for many reasons|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 1. 2@C can be three cards|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|petergill: The club lead is normal on this auction, as dummy will have short spades|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 3. Partner could be 6-4 in the blacks|pg||
nt|rhelle: totally agre|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk3: 4. It's only 'right' to pass if opener is 5-5|pg||
nt|petergill: Even I, who detests trump leads in general, would lead a club from Q10x on this auction.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|petergill: Zack decided to pass because he was so weak, as when 2@S was making, partner will often not pass 2@S. I'm not sure that I like tha tlogic - I would bid 2@S over 2@C|pg||
nt|Walddk3: There is one more advantage if you decide pass. You stop partner from bidding again!|pg||
nt|Walddk3: If you give preference to 2@S, you may hear 2NT next and you don't really want that with a 6 count|pg||

nt|rhelle: I liked the small @d - could be very good|pg||
nt|rhelle: and has still the potential of a couple of tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: Jack Zhao and Fu Zhong (current World Pairs Champions, from China) have the partnership agreement that East bids 2@H over 2@C on any 5 card @H suit, and that West then bids 2@s on ...|pg||
nt|petergill: this actual hand. Their aim is to not miss 5-3 4@H games.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Zack could be pretty certain that Barel had four clubs. If 5323 for example he had the option of passing opposite a passed hand|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
nt|Walddk3: However, that could also be wrong as responder may have six cards in a red suit|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|c8|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|rhelle: a convention everyone should play|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|petergill: Yes|pg||
nt|rhelle: it means that after 1X - 1Y - 1NT, 2@c = transfer to 2@d, now every bid is a limit|pg||

mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: this is a poor slam - it's main virtue is that it's cold|pg||
nt|petergill: Kate McCallum wrote a very good and long article about Two Way Checkback in recent issues of Australian Bridge magazine. Google it if you want to follow this up. |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|petergill: On the spade lead, slam is poor. On a non-spade lead, slam is OK|pg||
nt|rhelle: after this lead he has interesting options|pg||
nt|rhelle: he can run the @s - but there seems little point|pg||
nt|petergill: The lack of opposition bidding increases the chance of good breaks in the minors. |pg||
nt|rhelle: he can cash @c AK, and hope he can discard a @couple of @s on the @d|pg||
nt|petergill: There is the possibility of dumping the 3rd @d on the hearts|pg||

nt|Walddk3: You mean less sick, Peter, surely :) About time that the Dutch players ask for a sickbag|pg||
nt|petergill: Given that the opening leader might have @SK, overall the slam is not as bad as it might look|pg||

nt|rhelle: 3@c another relay - 3@d short @s|pg||

nt|rhelle: not 3NT = South can count 5@c, 2@d and 1@s trick|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Yes, but North could have @DQ I suppose|pg||
nt|petergill: North is about 6-8 HCP I think, so 5@C is more likely than 6@C|pg||
nt|rhelle: of course - or the @sK or @hAce|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Not heart ace when he has 9 hcp, right?|pg||
nt|rhelle: We know that - South doesn't. North can he 6-8 with any number of controls|pg||

nt|Walddk3: Yes|pg||

nt|rhelle: Now with 3@h Mulller can ask for North's exact distribution - and 3@s will show 1-4-3-5 |pg||
