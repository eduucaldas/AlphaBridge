nt|marcsmith: 2C 1D 1S to lose in spades|pg||

mb|1H|nt|marcsmith: maybe bit winning decision is to XX and defend 2D-X which is just too hard|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|andyv:  that would be tough... plus I hate to defend when I hold a 7 card suit and it's not trump (esp. at the 2 level!)|pg||
nt|wygbe1: many would play the direct 4s bid as exclusion for hearts - but not this pair obviously|pg||
nt|jcwla: Do you prefer Karwur's 2@D or Waluyan's 3@D?|pg||

nt|wygbe1: playing forcing nt, with 4522, you would have to rebid 2c over 1nt|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|andyv:  yes, all N did was keep dbling and finally S bid 5@C|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  no, Marc, I can assure you somewhere in the bridge world there is someone else who hates it:)|pg||
nt|marcsmith: IMO this shows a much better (and at least 6-card) spades suit|pg||
mb|3C|nt|marcsmith: well I know Kokish does|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  nice bid by S...now to avoid the 6 level:)|pg||
nt|marcsmith: i once saw him overcall on a 24 count, so that motley 18 would be an automatic 1S|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: 3C is a truly unbelievable bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@c has to be key card|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 3S would seem reasonable, but 3C?|pg||
nt|marcsmith: no it's natural and it'll end the auction|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  really?  I didn't think you were allowed to play 4 of a minor in teams:)|pg||
nt|marcsmith: true|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|marcsmith: can't argue with success i suppose|pg||

nt|marcsmith: but i still hate the original double|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|marcsmith: much easier all round if the auction starts (1H)-1S-(2H)-P-(P)-Dbl|pg||
nt|andyv:  it worked well in CR (the dbl) because W bid 4@h immediately.... with W passing here, N was put in an awkward position.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: not an unexpected one though|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s9|nt|jcwla: Well, the pass by W is certainly an interesting choice.|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|jcwla: In view of what W has made game tries on in this segment.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: true|pg||
nt|marcsmith: i wonder if they have a stronger way to bid 2H after 1H-X |pg||
nt|marcsmith: if you play transfers, then 2D would be a sound 2H bid and 2H just any one garbage with three hearts|pg||
nt|andyv:  and E hand certainly falls into the 2nd catagory|pg||
nt|vugraphzhe: thinking.....|pg||
nt|marcsmith: you think?|pg||
nt|marcsmith: I'd have made the stronger bid if i had one available|pg||
nt|andyv:  however, W could have been creative and bid 3@c as a game try|pg||
nt|marcsmith: the 2H bid shows the same hand without the HK|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c2|nt|marcsmith: usually, 1H-X-2H shows a hand with three hearts that would have passed aftr 1H-P-?|pg||

nt|marcsmith: yes but a danger of playing 6S which fails|pg||
mb|1C|an|16+|nt|Walddk2: The danger is that they get to 6@S instead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: great minds ...|pg||
nt|marcsmith: indeed|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|jcwla: Definitely one for the bidding contests.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: much will depend on whether their brand of precision is natural based or asking based|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: It doesn't matter much on this auction|pg||
nt|marcsmith: not now no|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They never leave you alone whether they have something or not|pg||
nt|marcsmith: may end in 4H X now|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: actually, South has done well because 1H was rather feeble on the North cards over a strong club|pg||
nt|andyv:  this auction really struggling|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think the club suit is dead and buried forever|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But that happened in the early 50's I think|pg||
nt|marcsmith: ah it's changed to 3H -- 4H would have really stuck it to E/W|pg||
nt|marcsmith: personally I prefer 3H over 1C|pg||
nt|marcsmith: may work well for N/S though, as they may have left their ops just enough room to get to 6S|pg||
nt|marcsmith: even if West just raises to 4S surely E is worth another try|pg||
nt|marcsmith: although perhaps not over a really slow 4S|pg||
nt|jcwla: Even discounting the @HK, the W hand is primo.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: has already opened a 16+ club tho|pg||
nt|marcsmith: so not much to spare|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When fixed, stay fixed. I don't think he can bid anything but 4@S|pg||

mb|4H|an|cue fit !C|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: now is 4C natural or a cue for spades i woner?|pg||
nt|marcsmith: wonder|pg||
nt|marcsmith: and is 4H now a return cue with spades agreed or a cue for clubs|pg||
nt|marcsmith: i'm guessing they know|pg||
nt|andyv:  feels like EW are sparing right now|pg||
nt|wygbe1: hi all|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|Walddk2: 4@H can be "last train". Whatever it is, he is worth it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi Jim|pg||
nt|marcsmith: would 4S now be to play or a cue with clubs agreed?|pg||
nt|marcsmith: the sort of situation a regular partersnhip needs to have discussed|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Jim:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4@C should be a cue for @S I would think -- if had a suit to get off chest, could have over 3@H.  Hi Jim.|pg||
mb|5H|nt|marcsmith: we'll know when we see how many key cards he shows whether its spades or clubs that are agreed|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: i think so too, but it seems that Danny thinks 4C was natural|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is 6@C a DOPI response or natural I wonder|pg||
nt|marcsmith: if Frankie passes now, they've done remarkably well|pg||
nt|marcsmith: natural|pg||
nt|marcsmith: it's too high for a DOPI response|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, might be DOPI or DEPO depending whether we're above 5 of our trump suit -- which is what again? :)|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  too bad W had a 6@s bid in his bid box|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wygbe1: from the penthouse to the outhouse|pg||
