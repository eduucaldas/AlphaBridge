mb|4S|nt|iain sime: Wales seem to be NS and EW here.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not Grant-Macdonald I can tell you|pg||
nt|rmb1: This is the third round of matches (this match completes tomorrow).  EBU v Northern Ireland.  EBU are the host team to make an even number of teams|pg||
nt|rmb1: NS play weak NT and open four card suits|pg||
nt|ahh: the choice or rebid by east is either 2@S or 2@H  both will have fans |pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|ahh: think screens are used so it will be east thinking |pg||

mb|2S|nt|cuttysark: The strong 1NT suggests our pair are Adamson/Symonds|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@H to play opposite the majors|pg||
nt|ahh: but  she  gets in with overcall |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Peter Lund|pg||

mb|3H|nt|marlowepi: je m'etonne que S n'a pas dit 1SA|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: 3@C pass or correct: to play in partner's second suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: Miad Grant and Sheila Macdonald are EW in the open room. Sam doesn't do mornings (if she is given the choice). Hence why I am guessing Sheila Adamson and Ane Symons are NS.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|iain sime: Sorry Maida and Anne mis-typed.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The clue is in the NT range - A/S are the only strong NT pair, Sheila Adamson usually sits North|pg||
nt|bg: Hi all!  1 NT seems like a good spot  N has a tough lead to make|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cuttysark: Slightly surprising that South did not open - she is just back from her honeymoon and might bein optimisitic mood|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|nt|pelu: strange that East gave up - doubble fit and singleton @H?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|iain sime: West would have done better to rise ace. But 3NT could have made anyway- win the third club and rely upon the spade king.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: 6 IMP ca coute assez cher, surtout pour l'equipe qui a besoin des points|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahh: this should go down so no great loss |pg||
pc|hK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Just the plan Sheila is adopting|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d8|nt|iain sime: Winning the first club would have worked when West ducked. |pg||
nt|cuttysark: The altenative, playing East for @SA and @HK was unlikely to work|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think you can see that she has played @CA Iain :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess the auction in the other room had a similar meaning,  2@S = S + m.  2NT asking for minor.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pelu: only down with 2 @D-losers and 4@S on|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|iain sime: Sorry, I thought she had put in the nine.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 6 rounds of diamonds will put intolerable pressure on East if she actually has all the entries|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bg: nice play|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cuttysark: So the 23 count vulerable game will make - nice start for the Scots|pg||

nt|iain sime: NS are Adamson and Symons and they are the Scots at this table.|pg||
nt|iain sime: East West are Lane and Kennewell for Wales. They play standard acol with weak 2 D! H@S!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for kibitz that arn't from ireland and EBU i have take informations about the system played by Gross Brock|pg||
nt|ahh: first blood to Ireland|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|cuttysark: This 2@D is weka with both majors|pg||
nt|cuttysark: and it is quite weka|pg||
nt|bridge_one: it is a classical english acol, 4 cards majors, 2@C GF, 2@d multi, 2@H/@S 8/11 6 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: (sorry about the tyoing)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|marlowepi: encheres modeles|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think it is a efective way to play|pg||
mb|2H|nt|iain sime: NS play 15/17, five card majors and weak twos in the majors. Their 2D! opener is weak with at least 5/4 in the majors.|pg||
nt|ahh: 4@S can make on this 1 if N/S dont remove @D ace early |pg||
mb|2S|nt|bridge_one: overall in MP competitions|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Only 4 obvious losers, but the 4-0 break is awkward|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: hi all|pg||
nt|rmb1: Hi |pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|nt|sybarra: would take quite agressive bidding to get 4 since E if not enamoured of spades and @c bid didnt help W hand |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on this lead it would make any way|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 5@D 4@c 3@S are sure|pg||
nt|toobad: everything lies well for declarer here as long as she draws trump|pg||
nt|rmb1: Everything sitting very favourably for declarer but she may not take full advantage|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: 5 @D? |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1NT is 11/14 |pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|sybarra: you mean for cards in hand |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|bridge_one: 1@d 1@s 2@c = 5+@D 4+@c|pg||
nt|bg: looking at all 4 hands easy to play but many options not easy for E|pg||
nt|bridge_one: guessing it it easy to make the contract - but at the table must think at all events, so hard to play|pg||
nt|toobad: a good recovery|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahh: i am sure a few pairs would bid game here  but this Scots pair although very aggressive in certain areas on their game can be quite conservative |pg||

mb|1D|nt|ahh: p p  1@D and what does South bid ?   double 1@H  1 nt |pg||
mb|d|mb|1H|nt|iain sime: We don't seem to have a scores link. In the other room, Scotland were one down on hand 1 so that is 2 imps to Scotland.|pg||
nt|toobad: looks like 11 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|jbgood: a decent spade game here, even 3 NT is on guessing clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: what would u bid in S? - X - 1Nt or 1@h?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahh: so west picks off south s suit |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Wales|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cuttysark: Queen lead askig for a reverse attitude signal - South will discourage perforce since sh has no small cards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 10 IMPs coming to Scotland on board 2 when Wales came to rest in 1NT in the open room|pg||
nt|pelu: Pass in W!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: in my book :)|pg||
nt|ahh: this is the modern game  best fit @C  but no one can bid the suit |pg||
nt|pelu: East could open 1@c|pg||
nt|ahh: however north might lead @C |pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: and pard (N) now likely to lead clubs|pg||
nt|ahh: need to make this to flatten board |pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzhb: not sure I agree with 3@S|pg||
nt|pelu: after 1NT (and not pass) N exp that decl only have 2 card @s|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|toobad: 5d should put the brakes on|pg||
nt|ahh: east opened 1@C in other room and had unusual rebid |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jbgood: perhaps S indicated more values going slow?|pg||
nt|toobad: agreed|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cuttysark: Another 4-1 heart break|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however K was superior before - winning with 3/2 - the finesse need a 4/1 - probably with 4 trump North dont ruff the @D ..|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|iain sime: So that will be 12-0 to Scotland. But I expect they will struggle to get a plus score on hand 3 with the diamonds stacked behind AKxxx.|pg||

mb|d|mb|6S|nt|bridge_one: 3@D search the possibility to play a slam in a minor|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with Q in @D in North instead Q in @h slam in @D is the ricgth contract|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after this auction the lead @H seam the only|pg||

mb|p|nt|bridge_one: @C and @D in South|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|bridge_one: A in @S to see the dummy is ok the same (also if there are the risk to lose a time)|pg||
nt|bg: S should pick up entire dia suit safe to finesse 9 first round|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if east would stop the @C the lead @H would win, instead after A@S lead south could make 3Nt the same playing over the @S|pg||

nt|ahh: 5@C showed 1 key card and east had heard enough |pg||

nt|bridge_one: after Q@D lead, south must duck|pg||

nt|jbgood: somebody should have pushed to avoid the push:)|pg||
nt|ahh: 3nt could have been hairy on a @H lead |pg||
mb|1D|nt|cuttysark: Our scorecard is wrong because 4@H has been entered wrongly as played by North - it really is 12 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 2@D is a weak 2-suiter in the majors. Ugh!|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: well, trying to stop 3N by EW|pg||
nt|bridge_one: switching Q@D at second trick|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s9|pc|d6|nt|jbgood: a heart ruff high, spade to hand and heart and spade would have made life difficult for S|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|h5|nt|wilkinsona: might steel the oppos suit..I think its a good tactical try|pg||
nt|iain sime: But, maybe if they had reached 6D the ekrens would have worked, declarer playing South for a singleton heart honour.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c4|pg||

nt|Walddk2: But can you beat it even on a heart switch?|pg||
nt|loganrun: East should be wondering why diamonds were not played at trick 2 and she might have got it right|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|idc: this is shaping into something ugly|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|loganrun: I think East should double 3NT and then double 4S but no|pg||
nt|idc: opposite a protective dbl, I think I'd settle for 1@s as South|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Can you go to the E&R and ask for treatment against 4@SX? One should try that some day|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Playing 5card majors South had alrady shown 5, so 2@H would promise a 6th heart|pg||

pc|d7|nt|bg: now 2 clubs by non passed hand obviously not GF|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bridge_one: this hand is interesting bec 2@C is old natural style (no GF, like 2/1)|pg||

mb|1H|nt|cuttysark: Not sure whether the other table started with 11 & 12 - matches cut to 24 boards because the Irish had to come by ferry - or are just rather slow|pg||

pc|hA|nt|bg: EBU now on the board!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this counterplay happen more frequently you can think open Nt with 6 card in minor|pg||
nt|jbgood: E takes charge.. no need to consult prd|pg||
pc|h6|nt|iain sime: West should probably have doubled 3H and got their side to an unmakeable 5C.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||
nt|pelu: a bad (or not so good) 4@H i both rooms|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|wilkinsona: and spec who wanted to open 4 hearts may have got doubled here...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk4: wow, where did she get that from I wonder|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pg||
nt|iain sime: Wales will get their five top tricks now for 50.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Break for lunch after this. Restart in about 78 minutes, 12.9842 seconds, approximately|pg||
nt|mikeirl: this hand may give East a tough lead decision|pg||
nt|mikeirl: or thereabouts roland?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|mikeirl: may be difficult to avoid bidding 6@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, I think they will discover that they don't have a heart control|pg||
nt|loganrun: One small flaw in this minor suit slam - it would be cruel if East were on lead - say to 6NT|pg||
nt|mikeirl: probable make if they avoid q bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|eamongall: McGee is the better half of a well known Irish bridge and life partnership known as Toss and Anto ...  you can send them a letter ... Toss and Anto , Ardee ,Ireland |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C is inverted|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|eamongall: it will arrive I have been told |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|eamongall: oops I stand corrected by Tos ... Tos and Anto |pg||
nt|mikeirl: 4! seems automatic now|pg||
nt|mikeirl: *4@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Depneds what 2@D is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If 18-19 without shortage, then yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2d confirms 4 clubs   2h further enquiry|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3NT 18-19|pg||
nt|mikeirl: difficult not to move opp 1819|pg||
nt|mikeirl: *18/19|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but North has no red cue bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And South will sign off in 5@C|pg||
nt|mikeirl: correct lead possible now|pg||
mb|5C|nt|loganrun: This bid is tough for South - doesn't want to give up but worried about hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: North can't have a cue bid in a red suit when she bids 4@S|pg||
nt|loganrun: Unless they were playing first and second card cues, then 5C easy|pg||
nt|mikeirl: will East make same deduction|pg||
nt|idc: If only you could change your system to suit the hand you hold - South would like to bid 4NT if it was a non-specific slam try|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: and more encouraging than 5@c|pg||
nt|idc: now they have stopped in game, the @h lead looks pretty attractive|pg||
pc|c6|nt|loganrun: Roland North could still have the KQ of hearts if they are not playing multi cues - but wd by NS|pg||
nt|eamongall: I see Mamie McCormac family name grew a "K" again |pg||
nt|idc: if they had bid slam it would be a little harder to find; so who knows what would have happened|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They play mixed cues, Chris|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Italian style|pg||
nt|eamongall: that should be 13 tricks but no major damage in 5@Cs |pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|loganrun: Then 5C looks clear and they have done well|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

nt|ahh: 6@C can suffer a stake through the heart |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhb: yes last hand.|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to Alex Roberts, our operator,  great job |pg||
nt|bridge_one: so thx all for watching :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: I'll just check when it restarts.|pg||
nt|rmb1: Last board of the day.  Thanks to Ben (operator) and organisers in Manchester.  Thanks to co-commentators Jon, John and Heather Dhondy.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|cuttysark: Very strange result on Board 6 where the Welsh reached 3NT, got a spade lead, and somehow contrived to go down - wonder if it is accurate|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Giorgio and Bruce my co commentators |pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to our specs,  great comments !  I enjoy the humor |pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl with 4@H is obvious|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S would be a invenction|pg||
nt|sybarra: or "other suits"  |pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Play in this match resumes tomorrow at 10:00BST.|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: Thanks Robin. Hope you have all enjoyed watching|pg||
nt|jbgood: thank you Robin - it has certainly been an enjoyable set :)|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|iain sime: Another ten imps to Scotland. Wales had nine top tricks in 3NT in the other room, but decided to play for overtricks on the premise that our ladies could not possibly find a heart ...|pg||
nt|iain sime: switch!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@C means weak hand long @C - no forcing|pg||
nt|bridge_one: different from 2/1|pg||
nt|ahh: no messing here   spotlight on east |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not particularly scientific, but East is on a guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: ditto......... c u all tomorrow|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: some play the rebid of suit,  not forcing also  |pg||
nt|ahh: if she finds the @H lead well done |pg||
nt|sybarra: given the bidding not sure you lead from a K  |pg||
pc|c9|nt|jbgood: or perhaps entertaining is the proper adjective..|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think unlikely @H lead |pg||
nt|ahh: i do esp v Ireland |pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|bridge_one: direct count (H-L = even)|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: this can go off..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...on a black suit switch...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Spade looks best|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|sybarra: about a 15 min break after it finishes then |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|iain sime: Makes now.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...but friendly continuation is ok for declarer it seems..|pg||
nt|sybarra: or shorter if we take longer on this hand |pg||
nt|bridge_one: declarer can lose 2@s 1@D 1@H 1@C|pg||
nt|ahh: new leader  been exciting  set and well played |pg||
pc|c5|nt|rmb1: The previous board was the first big swing to EBU but they lead 27-14|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|bg: win dia ace lead spade Q N in a spot then|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: That is what my line would be, although if North then has the A@H, then you're in trouble for entries.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Lunch break now. Back in about 1 hour|pg||
