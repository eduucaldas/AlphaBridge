mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|heatherd: Looks like a 3NT for EW (6@c for Roland)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s8|nt|djneill: hi all|pg||
nt|dburn: well, they have an alternative to both|pg||

pc|d3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'll take 800 any day of the week|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c3|pc|h2|nt|dburn: standard weak two bid, standard reopening double, standard 800|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But maybe I won't get more than 500|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|heatherd: When you can make a ropey slam?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: I think West lost a trick|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|dburn: I think so too - 500 no great loss, and with auction likely to go the same way at the other table, could even be a swing to Scotland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I repeat, why do they play so fast? Is there a prize for finishing ahead of everyone else (timewise that is)?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|h4|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i know full well that 3NT would be reached quite often|pg||
nt|athene: yes, looks hard to avoid 3nt here, with 25 high and some long suits|pg||
nt|roswolf: do n/s really have to bid to 3nt on this one - i dont think so|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sure|pg||
nt|h_karluk: previous board buddy|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Scotland play in a 4-3 fit in OR|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes - after a double and an auction where someon might have bid diamonds - but not a girl's best firned this time|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, nicely done|pg||
nt|toobad: a well thought out hand by E |pg||
nt|othered1: Of course, the Michaels bid did help quite a bit|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: yes it was|pg||
nt|roswolf: wow the scots got caught|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: in the other room|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: of course south's hand is worth about six tricks fewer when north has @CA instead of @CAx :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Looks like 2@s for N/S and 3@c for E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: do you pass with south Liz?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|cuttysark: No - I show my club support|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not that it would make much difference here|pg||
nt|jferg: takes a club lead to beat this I think|pg||
nt|ady: weak 2 came to grief in OR|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: unless it pushes them to 6...diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: may do here|pg||
nt|roswolf: not now|pg||
nt|athene: i think east is better-off to pass and then double spades for takeout, but perhaps she was worried about getting pre-empted|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Two very conservative decisions on overcalling by North on this hand and number 31|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: i wonder what N needs to overcall 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: but when your right hand opponent opens a multi, you don't need to worry too much when you have a 3-suiter short in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: from west?|pg||
nt|athene: because unless responder has a good hand or support for BOTH majors, you aren't getting pre-empted right away|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: in OR    natural weak 2@H opened   pas   pass double  passed out|pg||
nt|athene: usually it's going to go 2@H p/c - 2@S from opener|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes bad judgment from east which will cost a bundle|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: 3@C really has to show a club suit|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C poor bid regardless|pg||
nt|athene: not a t/o double of spades|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D pass 2@H X all pass looks reasonable to me|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, I suppose it is another slam of a sort :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...diamonds back in the pack it seems..|pg||
nt|roswolf: 460/490 perhaps but 7 imps to EBU|pg||
nt|athene: east passing with only four trumps because a) she is over the suit and b) she is NV against V|pg||
pc|s8|nt|toobad: 4d 3s and 2h |pg||
nt|jferg: home now |pg||
nt|athene: if she doesn't want to pass and live it up a bit she just bids 3nt|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|s3|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The NI North siwtched to a spade at this point, and declarr finessed diamonds|pg||
nt|toobad: next hand|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|h_karluk: this hand is no exception, last time they played with 23 hcp, now better|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|roswolf: it is also part of nevena's style to try and penalise in these situations|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|athene: declarer's basic strategy here will be "hope spades are 3-2 or there is @SJ10 doubleton"|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: 3-3 sorry|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: after the pass, difficult to pick cards in partners hand to beat this|pg||
nt|athene: KQxx over the suit is good when you have a shortage|pg||
nt|athene: you can pretty reasonably hope to make the KQ and a spade ruff|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|h2|pc|s7|pg||

nt|Walddk2: About the cocktails?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|dburn: about the defence, I would imagine|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|vugraphzgx: defence, but in a nice way|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|heatherd: One or two guesses in this|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dburn: how strong was 1NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nevena is a great declarer, so if anyone can ....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12-14|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|dburn: in that case, far from obvious to move at all on those West cards|pg||

nt|roswolf: another straightforward board i think|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well done..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this time a good score for Scotland from the OR|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They have a toy - 2@D opener to show both majors. Probably wuite sound at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: can go off if played by E perhaps..|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If South finds the diamond lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be the unbid suit..|pg||
nt|othered1: was properly right-sided for two rounded reasons.  Well done.|pg||
nt|othered1: somewhat lucky 6@C here with favorable @H position and major suit squeeze to boot.|pg||
nt|jferg: did well to bid and make  6c this in the other room|pg||
nt|othered1: Neatly avoiding the hopeless 4-4 major suit fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: a thin 3nt bid and made by the english in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead |pg||
nt|athene: even with 25 high, it's a long uphill slog to nine tricks for EW|pg||
nt|athene: more proof that 4333 = evil|pg||
mb|1N|nt|nigel_k:  There is a possible 6@h on this hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Another room got to the good 3N  1@H-2@C-3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: may have to guess the spade jack |pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead from south is going to help|pg||
mb|2C|nt|cuttysark: 2@S may be spades and any other suit|pg||
nt|toobad: a robust 2H from Bunty|pg||
nt|othered1: Auction to 3N was good, as west knew partner had values in @H|pg||
nt|othered1: And NS, of course, were out of the auction after the opening bid|pg||
nt|othered1: East has a choice of actions:  pass, some number of @S, or NT.  Your action?|pg||
nt|athene: south of 2@C, anyone?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|athene: double of 2@C sorry|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|jferg: could we see this going for 800/1100 for a few imps pick up|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: One school of thought says West should buy NT|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt looks pretty good here|pg||
nt|athene: can't you just duck a heart|pg||
nt|athene: opps can cash only @CAKQ at most|pg||
nt|athene: now you have nine tricks if the spades come in or the hearts come in|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cuttysark: I feared that a trump lead might be tempting with this spade holding|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well I though the lead was 50-50..|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North led @HA in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|toobad: no lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: whats with all these trump leads suddenly...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jferg: 6 spades likely now|pg||
nt|athene: even though this auction cries out for a safe lead (opps have limited values and south knows the cards don't lie well for them) it's pretty much impossible for her not to lead a ...|pg||
nt|athene: diamond|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|h_karluk: i think carbon copy auction in OR|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. on @DQ lead you win @DA, unblock the @SJ, and duck a heart|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  West is quite lucky that the East hand is so suitable for slam given East's pass over 2@s|pg||
nt|othered1: East has another interesting call to  make.|pg||
nt|othered1: Was double a routine negative double, or might it have been necessary to show a good hand?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|h_karluk: The important thing is 2@d GF, right?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|athene: ok i just checked - that's exactly what declarer did in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: it was played the other way up but same line|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Declarer can play to set up clubs, or to ruff a diamond. Both lines work here.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If there was no chance of a club trick, the right line would be to cash two rounds of trumps and three rounds of diamonds|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems to be the 'in' thing - I am not a fan|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Ace of diamonds holds it to 10 and flatens the board..|pg||
nt|toobad: big hand i expect. hence E progressing|pg||
nt|othered1: Yes, west's @C bids don't necessarily look like he's preferring his solid suit.  Maybe the 4@H cue got this headed in the wrong direction|pg||
nt|jferg: think necessary to show a good hand, cannot bid 2s as only 4 and I think 3 clubs would not be forcing|pg||
nt|othered1: what about an earlier cue-bid?|pg||
nt|othered1: like 3 or 4@H directly over 2?|pg||
nt|jferg: must be a void or singleton showing a good hand|pg||
nt|othered1: and west has, including @C support?|pg||
nt|toobad: thinking about 6nt i think|pg||
nt|toobad: 6s or 7c not a hit|pg||
nt|othered1: On reflection, a well-tuned partnership might infer the huge @C fit and secondary @S, due to cue-bid at a point where east hadn't owned up to @S length.|pg||
nt|jferg: perhaps east is thinking this is a grand slam try|pg||
nt|othered1: To t urn this congested auction into a grand slam try means you have an extremely well discussed partnership, 'cause hoping partner will go right at this level without firm ...|pg||
nt|othered1: agreements is way too risky.|pg||
nt|athene: tough hand to play because there's no suit declarer can just beaver away at whilst she thinks about things|pg||
nt|athene: she has no way to postpone the guess in spades |pg||
nt|athene: since that's the suit she has to play on|pg||
nt|athene: well, she might try cashing a few hearts, but that gives up on some options in *that* suit|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|athene: south's alternative is to go @DA, club and hope south doesn't win the first club trick - then the diamonds are protected|pg||
nt|jferg: obviously worried about her club suit|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: sorry west's alternative|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jferg: 14/15 imps for N.I.|pg||
nt|roswolf: the odds are with declarer here i think|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: but that feels inferior|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|nigel_k:  Making if diamonds are 3-3 or the short diamonds and short trumps are together|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A dummy reversal is also possible|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: but she knows from the cue-bid and both NS bidding that she's facing @H void.  So when will this make when 6@C won't?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|toobad: its not over until its over|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: may even get an overtrick|pg||
nt|ady: good guess|pg||
nt|athene: the lead looked as though it was from a long diamond suit - i was expecting declarer to play north for the @SJ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|nt|nigel_k:  Now declarer is relying on the club suit which luckily also works|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: small club must be best now... |pg||
nt|roswolf: too late methinks|pg||
nt|ady: overtrick now |pg||
nt|athene: if north wins and plays a diamond back declarer will cash out|pg||
nt|ady: club need no help if the spade is guessed |pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://psbridge.gotdns.com/bbo/allvug/  - Vugraph Hand Records (PDF)|pg||
nt|athene: oh sorry she can't cash out - the spades are blocked|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|toobad: see|pg||
nt|athene: but north can't return a diamond, not having one :)|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if declarer took a deliberately swingy view in spades|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: does she know her side is behind?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: a push|pg||

nt|roswolf: this is a trappy hand|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: If one of NS opens, the other hand looks quite good..|pg||
nt|cuttysark: hard to stop at a making level|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Well done by E/W |pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: q@C was a little insulting :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes declarer would never play that way with another club|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But it did end the hand faster|pg||
nt|ady: would be forced to play clubs|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that would force her into the overtrick anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Playing a weak NT is it inadvisable to open light in 3rd seat - sever danger of being penalised|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  And declarer was bound to make anyway|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be messy if east gets carried away|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: it would be strange for EW to get higher than 2@H|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: 1@D overcall from north might warn EW off 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: especially when south raises diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: suddenly @DQxx is looking a little bit nervous|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2 way hook |pg||
nt|roswolf: this overcall may help e/w avoid the doomed 3nt but may welll bid to 5@C instead|pg||
nt|roswolf: a weak 2@H might get caught here|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: south wants to get spades into it|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: still, should avoid their diamond fit|pg||
nt|toobad: i agree Ed but we all do strange things at the table under pressure|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't have many partnerships I'm confident would work through that last hand correctly, unless they open east 1@H.|pg||
nt|athene: west might consider a double of 1nt there|pg||
nt|ady: might get to a speculative 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: will north be aggressive?|pg||
nt|athene: not penalties, just showing a general desire to enter into the fun|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: and she will find a fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: support double?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: doubled 5@c could be a disaster|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i would bid 3nt as south|pg||
nt|athene: south has to like that @DQ10|pg||
nt|roswolf: precisely|pg||
nt|athene: you bid 3nt now i suppose, vul at imps, don't you?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|athene: looks as though EW play opener's double as strong notrump|pg||
nt|athene: they might play 1nt rebid there as showing 3 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: west has to restrain herself i feel|pg||
nt|athene: north will bid 2@S now perhaps|pg||
nt|roswolf: and she has:)|pg||
nt|athene: or not of course|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: they do have a 4-4 fit but she does have a 7 count facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: it would be sad if opps woke up and bid a making game or something|pg||
nt|roswolf: well e/w got that one right|pg||
nt|athene: i am very surprised south didn't bid 2@D over 2@C|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I'm not fond of the light overcalls. It's reasonably effective when it works, but i personally hate the price i've to pay to use it. Givin' up sound overcalls is too great a loss ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for me. To me North's pass was better|pg||
nt|athene: when she doubles, she is taking a big risk of losing the diamond fit, just to try to get a spade fit into the picture|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup - a little suprising i agree|pg||
nt|athene: she was very lucky to be able to catch up and bid 2@D second time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: coffee break|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  E/W did well to stop low|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  4@h is not a very good contract and everything lies badly|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Even 3@h is too much|pg||
nt|othered1: 41H really isn't bad here at all.  should be bid vul.|pg||
nt|toobad: i think she just has to trust her p and take a plus in 6c..|pg||
nt|roswolf: well conservative|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will surely misguess the @DJ|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|cuttysark: All going similarly to the other room - not an imp has changed hands yet|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Hard for declarer to see any line to make this one|pg||

pc|h8|nt|athene: north's reticence is understandable - she knows EW have plenty of hcp|pg||

nt|othered1: How many more @H would be question to me.|pg||

mc|7|nt|athene: but i think south was a bit over-cautious there - perhaps if west's double was explained as strong notrump or better, she just "deduced" that her partner had very little, but if ...|pg||

nt|roswolf: west took a flyer in the other room|pg||
nt|cuttysark: You always feel a little silly going 4 down - but these 3N contracts either make or fail by lots|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The defence slipped up a bit there but E/W were always gaining IMPs once they stopped at the two level|pg||
nt|petepunt: poor slam but @S lying well|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  What happened in the open room?|pg||
nt|othered1: and the ruling should be?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: they went back and played a club as originally called for|pg||
nt|jferg: good chance of making 4 hearts on previous board north has a tricky opening lead, but you can endplay north after ruffing third dia  and end play them later, very interesting play ...|pg||
nt|jferg: hand|pg||
nt|ady: competition in the najors|pg||
nt|athene: there are lots of ways this auction can tempo out where NS bid 4@S over 4@H|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can only make 3@H on decent defence  and n/s 2@S |pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks good for england - a thin game bid and made|pg||
nt|athene: i assume 4@H made when there was a diamond pitch on a club|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks probable|pg||
nt|ady: defence needs to play diamond before ace of clubs is forced out|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: yes, you have a lot of losers for a 5-level bid at equal vul|pg||
mb|2D|mb|4H|nt|athene: apart from anything else, there's a really big danger partner might have a monster and take you seriously, and bid six or something|pg||
nt|athene: just pass 4@S and then if partner doubles again, ok, NOW perhaps you have a decision to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point|pg||
nt|athene: very tough for the defence to be fair, when it's played by east|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: could West does really have a decision after 3@s?|pg||
nt|roswolf: east might double if this is passed to her but west will just bid 4@C|pg||
nt|athene: looking at that west hand as dummy, you don't immediately think of the need to attack diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: 2N is jacoby and West has to bid 3N with 15-17 bal|pg||
nt|roswolf: bidding was simple|pg||
nt|ady: I agree not an easy defence|pg||
nt|athene: i think this is likely to go the same way:- spade lead, two top spades, club switch, end of story|pg||
pc|sT|nt|petepunt: they play 12-14 1nt|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They are likely to reach slam then in East knows that West is 15-17|pg||
nt|roswolf: well lets see what a world champion can do|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|athene: 3@S non-forcing here; i assume NS play unusual vs. unusual|pg||
nt|athene: so with a forcing spade bid south would bid 3@H or something|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am quite surprised that W bought 5@c in OR, and paid -800|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: same sequence..|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North led a diamond and South switched to a spade - that worked well|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I hope East isn't thinking of grand|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: WEST SHOULD STAND THIS|pg||
nt|athene: i think the double of 4@D should show a "strong" 2nt overcall|pg||
nt|h_karluk: overhelming, i hope mine is a fair criticism|pg||
nt|athene: so east doesn't need to double again|pg||
nt|athene: she already showed her hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Spade lead gives a trick|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this may make yet..|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, if she runs @C10|pg||
nt|roswolf: remember north needs 2 more tricks =|pg||
pc|s9|nt|roswolf: even -690 will gain imps!|pg||
nt|petepunt: may not even make 6@H this early in the morning,  its an afternoon play hand! :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzgz: seems to be...|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: when 2nt can be such a range of strengths, your first priority is to be able to express the good hand - much more use than emphasising diamonds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and would overthrow partner in post-mortem|pg||
nt|athene: and as a spec points out, if NS bidding is to be believed, west has nothing (north's 4@D was a good spade raise), so doubling 4@S is asking for trouble|pg||
nt|athene: basically it's just asking partner to choose between -690 and -800|pg||
nt|roswolf: the dragon doubles on principle|pg||
nt|athene: i think east is way too aggressive here and she is lucky NS didn't send this back|pg||
nt|athene: maybe they are scared of her :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: redouble the dragon - needs a very stout heart:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unpleasant guess ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i would lead a heart which is clearly one of east's suits|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it won't be easy|pg||
nt|roswolf: sandra taking her time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s doubled looks like a real success story|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks a logical play..|pg||
pc|cT|nt|roswolf: 4th highest of longest and strongest - the old fallback|pg||
nt|roswolf: so a diamond is logical|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But she does no now hearts are breaking so balyy, may think she just needs 2 club tricks|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  As Peter said, both spade honours are onside and I don't see an alternative line|pg||
nt|othered1: EW bought this with east's response.  NS don't have much to make, despite 23-17 HCP edge.|pg||
nt|roswolf: but not found|pg||
nt|athene: a very interesting defensive problem|pg||
nt|athene: north knows her side needs two more tricks|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|nt|cuttysark: 'does not know...'|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think declarer would be able to draw the big picture after two rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|petepunt: its one of those things people often dont consider,   but no other chance here.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: a spec states- North knows from the first 2 tricks that E has only 4 minor suit cards. Club switch cannot beat the contract in that case!|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Playing North for singleton Q or J is the only other option and that is less likely than QJ(xx) in South|pg||

nt|jferg: do they have a bid to show 3 card trump support and 7-9 points|pg||
nt|othered1: 9+ losers and 3 trumps don't merit a 3-level invitation|pg||

nt|roswolf: at least on the face of the n/s hands alone|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: and west should axe|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think west should double this - it might sometimes allow declarer to make it (finesse against @H10)|pg||
nt|athene: of course when it goes two down she will wish she had doubled :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe the must question is 3@c really needed or not|pg||
nt|roswolf: nevena's overcalls vul are sound and west has a nasty suprise for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: this is the sort of hand they put in bidding challenges, where a singleton jack or queen in partner's long suit is worth about 8 hcp|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: to the specs commentators are supposed to anticipate the bidding sequence even if the contract goes off on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|roswolf: got about 30 comments from specs re 6@D:(|pg||
nt|athene: what, along the lines of "you shouldn't bid 6@D, because diamonds are 5-1"?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup with various degrees of sarcasm|pg||
nt|ady: south has so much in the black suits and not a good fit for north  |pg||

pc|s6|nt|cuttysark: I agree with Anne Symons - I would not put this dummy down in 3NT.|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|othered1: Lots of conventions, but those based on getting to the 3-level with only 3 trumps and without maximum pass high card points are unsound.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h2|nt|athene: this is more sensible line - no need to unblock the @DJ right away because even if the defence win the @CA right away they can't knock out the heart entry to dummy|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

pc|s5|nt|nigel_k:  This is an easy 3NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: i mean north must have had something to say at some point|pg||
nt|roswolf: an ekrens type bid scooped the pool for the english e/w in the other room|pg||

nt|athene: she is a passed hand after all|pg||
nt|roswolf: nut north passing looks strange|pg||
nt|roswolf: but|pg||
nt|athene: even if north passes the opening bid, south has to wade in over 2@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: but where did wests double come from?|pg||
nt|athene: west's double here is pretty reasonable|pg||
mb|3S|nt|cuttysark: We have lost the auction from the other room: something like 1@C-1@S-1NT-2@D-P-P-Dbl all Pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i beg to differ the heart honours are hardly well placed|pg||
mb|4C|nt|othered1: especially if there's any chance that small slam won't be bid in other room.  Not the case here with all those high cards.|pg||
nt|athene: but NS are going to game for sure, after 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: and not a overwhelming one also|pg||
nt|jferg: 3h now follwed by a seriws of cues|pg||
nt|jferg: ciara staight to key card|pg||
nt|othered1: That's how I"d do it, but balckwood will keep it simpler.|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s might bid 5@D now|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|athene: in the other room, after 2red- 2@S, even when south passes, north could still double 2@S for takeout in the passout seat|pg||
nt|ady: n/s J@C short of a good slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: they will is 2@D WAS A 2/1 RESPONSE|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Unfortunately we missed this board in the open room, but when we came back, we had 110 to EW in MOVIE|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That is quite astonishing|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmmm curious|pg||
mb|5C|nt|cuttysark: The NI pair have bid this well - disappointing to lose 5 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: good lead may hold dec to 10|pg||
nt|roswolf: blackwood bid by a passed hand - crikey!!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our guess is that West opened and that EW had it all to themselves after that|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D looks too much with club layout and diamonds 3-1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@C   1@H  ;   1@S   2@S   a.p.|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|dburn: now at least South knows that North has the ace of spades, so that bidding six is not quite so attractive|pg||
nt|roswolf: a grand try - incroyable|pg||
nt|athene: a spade splinter is just what that south hand wanted for christmas, so i can see why she is getting excited|pg||
mb|6D|nt|dburn: but she appears to be committed to that at least|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s8|nt|roswolf: cant see how to make this one with trumps 3-1|pg||

nt|roswolf: if this goes off then she still gains 2 imps!!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Gaining 2 IMPs for going down in 6@D, quite amazing|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|mug: you need three trumps to draw, one to ruff a spade, and another to ruff the final club|pg||
nt|mug: unfortunately dummy only has four|pg||
nt|athene: the alternative is to try to reverse dummy and ruff the hearts good, but you still run out of trumps just the same|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|roswolf: a push|pg||
nt|dburn: many ways to play clubs - if it were a case of needing four tricks, ace and another would be best|pg||
nt|mug: only BBO commentators think of reversing the dummy anyway, it is a perennial blindspot for players of all standards|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|s5|pg||
nt|dburn: but things being what they are, something to be said for running the queen, in case you can make five tricks|pg||
nt|athene: on the bidding, declarer can be fairly sure west has four clubs|pg||

nt|h_karluk: @d Q - headache today|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt or 5@D; you just need to cash the right big diamond first|pg||
nt|athene: well, that is, the left one, as we are looking at it :)|pg||

nt|mug: well done?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: putting opps under pressure and inducing the mistake is part of the game|pg||
mb|2N|nt|othered1: 0ld question onnorth hand, double or overcall.  And if you double, how do you treat it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jferg: i think overcall and then x later|pg||
nt|othered1: Here I'd just raise @H to 3 on  this auction.|pg||
nt|jferg: should show a good hand with hearts and spades|pg||
nt|dburn: still unclear - chances for Scotland to gain yet|pg||
nt|ady: incredable though   already shown out of hearts   could comfortably have discaerded a heart|pg||
mb|3C|nt|wilkinsona: thats lots of tricks in OR..|pg||
nt|petepunt: we will never know:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Most people open the North hand these days but it is quite a bad hand really|pg||
nt|petepunt: this isnt that bad with 3@S 1H 1@C and maybe 3@D|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Bill translated my feelings, at 1st sight i also thought either 3N or 5@d, by the way how many of us would begin with 1@d as West? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: sry - sneaked the 1@H bid by me...|pg||
nt|othered1: If I'm within partnerships overcall range, I bid 1@H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: thanks, Kath,...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The 1NT rebid in the other room looks more normal...a few more imps to Scotland|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: cant say I like the approach much on that balanced hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: you can call me Stephen...|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@H is *really* conservative.  South clearly expected much less.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Just can't keep away from the operating, eh?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: so it would seem :)|pg||
nt|mug: next case|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jferg: seems a bit|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think 2nt was a transfer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Given that the EBU never took part in this event before now, it will obviously be their first win - as happened in the Camrose last year|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|athene: a spec has pointed out that a club lead is bad for 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: it takes you about two weeks to set up your spade trick for  9|pg||
nt|athene: and by then opps have two clubs, @HA, @SAK in the bank|pg||
nt|h_karluk: only 9 hcp as 1st seat in West or am i looking to a different page? :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: :) i think this may be difficult to get rght|pg||
nt|athene: a normal enough 1@D i think|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w are normally very aggressive|pg||
nt|athene: yes, only 9 hcp, but on the other hand it's spring, and the sun is shining|pg||
nt|athene: (well, shining through the volcanic ash, anyway)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: teehee:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: and they are on a roll|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|h_karluk: so with nothing wasted west felt herself can afford a @s rebid :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mug: England was the top three pairs in the IMP pair trial|pg||
nt|mug: EBU the next three|pg||
nt|athene: you might bid 3@S with that south hand (both minors, singleton spade) but even that's not perfect as your singleton spade is bigger than partner will expect|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|athene: will declarer run the diamonds and try and put some pressure on the defence?|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|roswolf: almost certainly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: done|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: and might lead to her rejecting 3nt when it's the right spot|pg||
nt|mug: never much to choose between the two teams|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|cuttysark: Makes you wonder about the effectiveness of Trials in choosing a team....I suppose it is the least contentious method|pg||

nt|mug: singleton queens can be tricky cards|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|petepunt: 1 off now|pg||

nt|petepunt: steven can u reverse N/S names Mrs McGee was south :)|pg||
nt|othered1: presumably a forcing raise here?|pg||
nt|jferg: inverted|pg||
nt|othered1: north should have a simple rebid within partnership's inverted minor methods.   Can be a bit complex, if you are opening strong NT.|pg||
nt|mug: Ireland bid 1@H-4@H|pg||
nt|mug: but Fawcett-Moore reached the small slam with a Jacoby sequence|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgz: sry :)|pg||

nt|othered1: Inverted minors are a terrific convention when you play weak NT openings.|pg||
nt|toobad: 1 off on a c lead|pg||
nt|athene: assuming 2nt is a game-forcing heart raise, north will surely push to slam with that hand|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: declarer can score 2 hearts to make this|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Impossible to locate the right cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|jferg: no one has discard problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it's a tough hand to express - if you pass and then show black suits, the sixth spade can so easily get lost|pg||

nt|athene: some people open those sort of hands 4@S|pg||

pc|d9|nt|h_karluk: let's refresh, defending weak 1N doubled is not easy right ? :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: This is not a great contract after east opens the bidding.  Needs @SQ on and nothing terrible in trumps, not good enough nonvul.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|jferg: nothing else to play for but s q with west|pg||
pc|s5|nt|wilkinsona: right, Stephen..|pg||
nt|roswolf: england beat ireland by 9 imps so EBU have won the event in some style -well done to all of them|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|h_karluk: then maybe in a good day they find time to revise the system|pg||
nt|athene: i believe meckstroth-rodwell have the agreement that they don't pass double of 1nt without some values - it's much easier to defend when both hands have some high cards|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: meckstroth in his book said they run to 2@C as a scramble with a weak hand no long suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: actually i disagree but you do need some more refined methods|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's the way we use in USA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: so if south ran to 2@C, north would pass that|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sure|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Opps are not going to interfere|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Positive response showing a suit headed by at least 2 of the top 3 honours|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/KokishRelays.html|pg||
nt|dburn: this should probably be natural, and maybe that is the way South intends it|pg||

mb|5D!|an|asking Q  + outside K|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Or indeed, the queen-asking thing. |pg||
nt|dburn: but as at the other table, it seems to be Blackwood for clubs|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think 3@C makes the auction forcing to 4NT, so no need for South to jump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The danger is of course 7@C, but I think they will avoid that|pg||
nt|dburn: OK - if 3NT would be forcing then 4NT should be Blackwood|pg||
mb|7C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Did I speak too soon?|pg||

mb|2C|nt|ady: hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: well a grand to start with|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well this should be as easy a grand as there is to bid|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: well... grands are never easy unless one hand can take control and ask for aces/kings|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Its a while since I had that good a hand opposite a 2@c opener.|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed if a positive promises 3 controls then 7nt is the probable lowest ethical rebid|pg||
nt|athene: and it can be hard to get into a keycard-asking mode unless you agree a suit early|pg||
mb|4N|nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon everyone and welcome back to Manchester in England for the annual Lady Milne Trophy. Six teams, five matches of 24 boards. This is the second half of a match from ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: round 2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to Tony Wilkinson|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@H here might be plus one |pg||
nt|roswolf: the direct approach|pg||
mb|5D|nt|wilkinsona: Hi everyone..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and well done to NI for getting here..|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|athene: the clubs are going on spades in good time|pg||
nt|jferg: looks like a 3nt for eng which should go off on a heart lead|pg||
nt|toobad: afternoon all|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the only slight issue for declarer is how to lead trumps twice from dummy|pg||
nt|jferg: hi merc|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello John x 2|pg||
nt|athene: ok this is fair enough - south "agrees" clubs to find out about keycards but she is presumably going to play it in notrumps|pg||
nt|ady: 5@H asking for queen of clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: and after the response south can ask for the Q@C and bid 7nt with impunity|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: 8 top tricks and this lead gives it it seems..|pg||
nt|athene: looking at that south hand i don't think 7@C can ever be better than 7nt, and might easily be very much worse|pg||
nt|ady: north with 2 outside kings can bid the grand|pg||
nt|athene: the only possibility is she might consider 7@D, as the clubs might need ruffing good|pg||
mb|7N|nt|h_karluk: I think five card major systems will almost gets to the best game, but because the auctions are oftgen long the defense will be accurate. On the other hand whatever benefits you ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: get from a lot of science, there's a lot to be said for direct, non-informative auctions. It can be very frustrating to play against a four card major system|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: *often - sry for typo|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks straightforward|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|athene: ok, all pretty reasonable|pg||
nt|roswolf: simples as the meekats say|pg||
nt|roswolf: meerkats|pg||
nt|athene: 5@S obviously was @SK, @CQ|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose north bids 6@C without the @CQ, and maybe 5nt with @CQ but no king to cue, or something like that|pg||
nt|roswolf: play wont take long|pg||
pc|d4|nt|h_karluk: Does anything other than 2@s make sense? ie 2N|pg||
nt|jferg: hi roland club lead now lets contract make|pg||
nt|athene: no, about as long as the second round of diamonds|pg||
pc|d5|nt|nigel_k:  There are eight tricks (1@s, 1@h, 4@d and 2@c)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Maybe another one can be set up in hearts|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: will declarer consider running the @H9?|pg||
nt|athene: play the lead to be a singleton|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|roswolf: people dont often lead sigleton trumps especially an honour|pg||

nt|roswolf: this may produce action|pg||
nt|athene: north perhaps has a 3@C bid over 1nt|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: slam time now...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: There hasn't been a slam for a while...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hard to understand North cashing the second spade and exiting with a diamond|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But it is always easier seeing all four hands|pg||
nt|jferg: another 3nt bu e/w|pg||
nt|athene: east may open 1@S in third but NS should wander into 3nt anyway|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this could be feisty|pg||
nt|ady: n/s likely to get to 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it's always hard to show clubs these days, since bidding clubs at the lowest available level is never natural|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: must be the volcanic fall out changing the lie of the cards..|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: east must open something|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|wilkinsona: this enough to give west a problem..|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgz: or not as the case may be...|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@S is not absurd 3rd in hand|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt is going to fare a lot better if south plays it|pg||
mb|2C|nt|cuttysark: Don't like the double - you can't expect partner to bid either of your long suits|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surely East should have tried 2 spades first time..|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: either a heart or diamond lead from east would cause some trouble|pg||
nt|roswolf: east now backs in|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Strange Pass by North.|pg||
nt|roswolf: ?|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Sorry - misread.|pg||
nt|athene: first round? well not that strange :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: practical bid by south|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with bidding over a weak notrump is that you actually need to be more disciplined, as game is much more likely, so you have to make it possible to bid constructively|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Four card players aren't always hurting in competition. They have a number of advantages:1-If the other side gets the bid. the opening leader will get off to a good lead 2-They get ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to open with 1@h or 1@s far more often than a five card major player. This can be advantageous for two reasons:a) it's harder to bid over 1@h or 1@s than over 1@c or 1@d b) when ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the opening bidder finds a fit responder can accelerate the bidding|pg||
nt|athene: south's decision here is whether to duck this|pg||
nt|athene: if she was 100% sure west had @SA of course she could win and play a spade|pg||
nt|athene: ducking risks a diamond switch which has its own problems|pg||
nt|athene: if you rise @DA you might have set up too many tricks for the defence|pg||
nt|athene: but if you duck, east puts a heart back and suddenly you are in big trouble|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmvthe ducking looks std|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you just duck this trick and throw a spade from dummy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: A good bridge player should bear in mind that sometimes the person you preempt is your partner|pg||
nt|athene: a) west is unlikely to find the diamond switch and b) even if she does you are quite likely to survive rising @DA|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Unless it would be the dreaded negative freebid - my idea of the worst convention ever|pg||
nt|jferg: might get too high in 5d|pg||
nt|ady: if west is on lead  Q@D  would beat it   unlikely  and if east is on lead   likely spade lead rather than killing diamond   so will likely make|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 2nt probably shows 18-19|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: the michaels should warn her off|pg||
nt|jferg: if west opened 2nt which many might it would not be long before she ended up in 4s which would not be a hit|pg||
nt|athene: it's a little bit cautious of south not to just bash game in|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose she is NV|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am sure sally will raise|pg||
nt|rednaxela: If south can't bid game, I wouldn't blame north for not going on.|pg||
nt|ady: north might stretch with 5th club|pg||
mb|3C|nt|cuttysark: NS made it hard - but so did the system|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the defence aren't cashing three diamonds most of the time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true, however that isn't always ideal|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well bidding slam then depended on inferences from the opponents bids...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  This should make easily|pg||
nt|roswolf: she knows her ops in the other room are likely to be there|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: ok what do i know|pg||
nt|roswolf: :(|pg||
nt|athene: hard for south to bid 3nt there perhaps if there were tempo issues|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Reasonable bid.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: ok, millions of tricks now|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Did they actually have 10 hearts beween them - or even 11?|pg||
nt|athene: but AKxx facing a long club suit - you don't need much from pardy to make 3n|pg||
nt|ady: this can be a swing for scotland    if game is bid in OR  should make|pg||
nt|ady: unless defence find that lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: perhaps less likely vs 3NT :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: the bath coup has worked|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sheila has kept the lead - but there is not a lot she can do with it|pg||
nt|jferg: should go off on carefull def|pg||

nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||

nt|jferg: hi ed good of you to join us|pg||
nt|ady: this lead holds to 9 tricks in clubs|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|wilkinsona: so after a good result on the first board NI miss out here...|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: she might even hook the @S10 - she has nine anyway|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|jferg: i can only count 8 tricks 3 hearts, 3 clubs 2 dias unless declarer runs dia 8|pg||
nt|othered1: that's n ot an unreasonable play|pg||
nt|othered1: on the auction with north showing all those major suit cards|pg||
nt|jferg: or see can play a dia to her eight which then gives her 3 dia tricks and as south has no more hearts left I think the contract gets home|pg||
nt|jferg: would you have opened wests hand 2 nt ed|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|athene: is declarer not going to go for a heart ruff in her hand?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s7|nt|nigel_k:  Good play to lead trumps from the top and avoid a possible diamond ruff|pg||
nt|othered1: No.  2N on off-shape hands kills slams and partner isn't passed hand yet|pg||
nt|toobad: only on mondays in smcoba|pg||
nt|jferg: well done Catherine|pg||
nt|athene: rely instead on leading towards the spade honours for a heart pitch |pg||
pc|s8|nt|nigel_k:  If South had Kx of spades and North xx for example|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|athene: spade pitch from east makes the overtricks a bit easier to come by :)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ady: can go down now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: but if the @SK lost to the @SA and west played another trump, declarer would be a trick short, likely to lose two hearts|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h8|pc|d7|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: heart now takes out declarer's entry to hand |pg||
nt|athene: before the @SQ is set up|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rednaxela: I'll be back in a bit.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ady: good defence by west|pg||
nt|athene: and then @SA, @HA, trump, and the @SQ is a bit forlorn|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|nt|athene: this makes it a bit harder for west - heart back was simplest|pg||
nt|athene: but the defence still prevail if west pitches the spade|pg||
nt|ady: J@S not needed|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: declarer has claimed and it has been accepted...|pg||
nt|athene: she gets in with the @HA, draws trump|pg||
nt|athene: declarer claimed one down?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: no - claimed making|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: EW shouldn't be accepting any claim more optimistic than -1 at this point|pg||
nt|ady: mystery |pg||
nt|athene: declarer was too eager to draw trumps - if she just leads the @HK after the @CA i don't see any way she is getting beaten|pg||
