nt|Gerben42: 1nt with 5@H is usually a good idea|pg||
nt|mcphee: good hand here for 4 suit tranfers|pg||

nt|haans: different opinions But who is right? one deal do not give the answer|pg||
nt|haans: 1000 deals do not give ...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Part of the answer is, that playing NT our judgment is very good, perhaps not for a suit-contract|pg||
nt|rnmalik: saw a fantastic segment before this-what hands.|pg||

pc|s3|nt|haans: @SJ hard to play |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eleni: And yes, it is a pairs tourney|pg||
nt|Gerben42: looks like +1, thus beating 5@C|pg||

nt|Gerben42: with only 2@H, dbl is ok I think|pg||
nt|rnmalik: making but difficult to bid KQ@C off side would not be worth it.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|haans: stop at 2@S?|pg||

nt|othered1: vul before bidding 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: yes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  At 3 maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: now will play 3@C|pg||
nt|zoh:  2@s?|pg||
nt|mcphee: well 1NT is a choice but with only 2@H dble is much more comfortable|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the problem is, now south will overrate his 7 hcp. |pg||
nt|eleni: on BBO, North is ddiony and South nickd, West is vasso, East doest play on BBO:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Results at the moment are: Levi 88 - Hliapas 91 and Zeis 92.|pg||
nt|haans: support double = show 3 spades|pg||
nt|cicus: coming back with 2@C seems rather purposeless to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|petrosa: -1  with logical play|pg||
nt|othered1: Many play rescue redouble focuses on opener's suit.|pg||
nt|sybarra: wow a XX |pg||
nt|sybarra: that comment would be made in jest  since they know how "lucky" it was  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bmkl: 2nd half of the Greek Open teams semifinal|pg||
nt|sybarra: poor S had not second place to go to |pg||
pc|h2|nt|ghionis: 1st swing here i think|pg||
nt|haans: NS not happy|pg||
nt|othered1: note that south picked his better red suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: S's 1NT actually helped EW to get to a better contract|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|haans: 1@D = weak|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is a hand I would say "do not try this at home"  |pg||
nt|sybarra: these are seasoned partnerships  |pg||
nt|othered1: south has a decision here?  I'd love to have this hand when partner bids @S into the opening bidder.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mcphee: i like this 2@S choice from S|pg||
nt|mcphee: it could easily outscore a minor partial, |pg||
nt|zoh:  duck the King|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|yuval10: very dangerous to make a balancing when you don't have the other major|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Gerben42: must make since 2@H does not|pg||
nt|eleni: Lucas' name on BBO is zentel|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, this game is rather thin|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H may have been 4 @H|pg||
nt|haans: 4 hearts|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rodal f: So I have the shiny lady Eline who is 5 years older than me. 17Y 408M. There u are specs:)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|cicus: in fact I would have bid an immediate 2@H instead of 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: yes, 1H was 4 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: but 2C was 5 clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: This should do much better than 3@C|pg||
pc|h4|nt|eleni: lucky hand for N-S, in the Open Room they made it|pg||
nt|sybarra: ai |pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe 730 better with that lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure a I lead a @S on that auction |pg||
nt|othered1: I think declarer now has timing to drive the @D and pull trumps.|pg||
nt|othered1: not to ignore the trick lost in @S, either.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mcphee: although I am not fond of reasponding a 3 card suit in these positions|pg||
nt|haans: not Big Clubs at its best|pg||
pc|h3|nt|eleni: nice bid from George Loussis|pg||
nt|zlatan: accident...|pg||
nt|eleni: still 5@s can make|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|othered1: I wonder why east thought south would have relative @S length, requiring that lead.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|zoh:  Tora atoy|pg||
nt|Gerben42: now draw some trumps|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mcphee: need to get the trumps going quickly if any hope to survive|pg||

nt|cicus: can't see this making|pg||

pc|sA|nt|haans: nope|pg||
pc|s5|nt|haans: did right in @H but 2 @H losers|pg||

nt|piret0: these teams are currently on 4th and 5th position|pg||
nt|cicus: so these are team no 4 and 5?|pg||
nt|piret0: :) |pg||
nt|haans: in Big Clubs wjs aftger openere 1@H rebid|pg||
nt|flash: we're a very small group this set, so pls move down toward the front of the auditorium and feel free to ask questions as we go|pg||
nt|sybarra: as you said Ed  all the time in the world |pg||
nt|othered1: Greast decision by north, in any case|pg||
nt|yuval10: oh yes he did, sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: and they didn't get dbld, for -500|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rodal f: Started same age then so right u are Eleni:)|pg||
nt|eleni: N-S are 4th on the 1st group of teams, while E-W are wnd|pg||
nt|eleni: 2nd|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: den to emfanizei ws 22|pg||
nt|cicus: :)|pg||
nt|haans: see also this site: http://www.bridge.ee/|pg||
nt|flash: from the Dutch perspective, this is another in a series of 'friendlies' against good opposition|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect E will  kick himeself re that lead |pg||
nt|othered1: Great, rather|pg||
mb|p|nt|lelos: zozis never opens an 11count balanced hand|pg||
nt|haans: according to thats score Starmen is the weaker team|pg||
nt|piret0: today we will braodcast all 8 teams; tomorrow will focus on leaders only|pg||
nt|piret0: Starmen had a bad 2nd round; 1st was great|pg||
nt|haans: is 2@D an opening?|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Thanks for the update, Piret|pg||
nt|cicus: starmen has 2 vp's more|pg||
nt|cicus: 221-219 I gather|pg||
nt|haans: yep u rite|pg||
nt|cicus: a strong weak 2 or a light opener|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Impossible - PASS with that hand. ThatÂ´s like giving the opponent the service in tennis|pg||
mb|2H|an|!s|nt|petrosa: is it the real result?|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: -1 is the real result, ill change it|pg||
nt|petrosa: ok it is logical|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: N just explained weak|pg||
nt|cicus: W 's X is light but sensible|pg||
nt|haans: 4M soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: he already did :P|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hard to find3NT as best contract here|pg||
nt|eleni: 22-19 then |pg||
nt|haans: mostly used as splinter|pg||
mb|2S|nt|zlatan: he ll bid 2@d|pg||
nt|haans: then Vahe to weak i think|pg||
nt|flash: Team Orange, the national team, is comprised of 4 pairs; 3 of the pairs will be selected to represent Netherlands in this year's European Championships|pg||
nt|yuval10: so far West had the majority of the points in each board|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: now the task is to apply the brakes in time|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H better game this time|pg||
nt|chick: first someone has to bid hearts, though|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|haans: rersponder usually have 8-12 hcp|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes-S hand did not require balancing but they are daring players dont let a chance go.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mcphee: lots of tricks in @S |pg||
nt|eleni: 16 teams play in this round robin and just 8 of them will be forwarded to the last round|pg||
nt|eleni: Yet he plays against experienced players:) George Roussos and Manos Hatzidakis (mathat on BBO)|pg||
nt|haans: slamming now????????????????????|pg||
nt|haans: the less the less often|pg||
nt|sybarra: E hitting the deck on 2 @S |pg||
mb|p|nt|zlatan: n guess :)|pg||
nt|haans: south to have opps honors so no slam|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Better write a book about WJS - this is board 3|pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not mean to be critical or double dummy  but from k10xx,  .......|pg||
nt|othered1: Here, with cards lying right, EW can make about 9 tricks in @S, but no way in safely at these colors.|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well,  see what I know,  |pg||
mb|4S|nt|Gerben42: 2@C is a tricky bid, now S will think his hand is worse than it is|pg||
nt|Gerben42: playing 2/1 I guess 1NT followed by 4@S is better|pg||
nt|mcphee: well that could lead to a missed slam|pg||
nt|zoh:  To 2@s einai forcing game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well 3@s is promising|pg||
nt|eleni: so far so good up to now:) good players play the correct contracts in both tables:)|pg||
nt|lelos: hard to find @d lead also|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: stop at5 4@S|pg||
nt|chick: the main reason hearts play better is the bad spade split ... EW cannot discover that in the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: a most aggressive bid:) at the other table, E-W are simply at 2NT|pg||
nt|eleni: the lead was also a @h|pg||
nt|eleni: John is thinking very long and he is right|pg||
nt|droopy17: gia 1 kato|pg||
nt|eleni: On the final contest 4 teams will plau on knock outs for qualification of 1/2/3/4 places|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Tasos:) and welcome|pg||
nt|bmkl: easy game despite duplicate values in @cs|pg||
nt|ghionis: nikos (a very friendly person) always enjoy the game as he does the same with his life|pg||
nt|eleni: unless if we have a surprise:)|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|flash: coach Anton Maas usually tries to have the pairs play against different opponents and in different team combinations throughout|pg||
nt|othered1: At m atchpoints, I  might reopen with 2@S on east's hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: frankly i see not reason for S to not bid 3@H ater 2@S|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C will lead to missed slam more often opposite @C shortness|pg||
nt|zoh:  Logika i antam einai @d|pg||
nt|yuval10: nowaday's approach is to bid games with thin values when red|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep |pg||
pc|s2|nt|eleni: same contract in the open room:)|pg||
nt|ghionis: he has never read at least one bridge book but he is excellant card player (and poker too)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very friend placement of cards|pg||
nt|yuval10: very nice lead by N|pg||
nt|rnmalik: friendly|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cicus: there is chance to make this|pg||
nt|haans: assume 4@D was kcb|pg||
nt|hawe45:  North will feel bad, when he sees dumnmy|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eleni: a pretty dubious contract:)|pg||
nt|lelos: logiko to gurisma afou o karlaftis eipe 3@h|pg||
nt|rodal f: Homeit runned for a push|pg||
nt|lelos: Hi Frank :)|pg||
nt|eleni: Same contract in the open room|pg||
nt|petrosa: I would open the N hand: 2NT|pg||
nt|haans: and what did 4@D really mean?|pg||
nt|haans: clibs honor + @HK at south can not be a suprise|pg||
nt|haans: unlucky hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is red and imps.....  not as easy |pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: I bet Brink-Drijver would bid 2@s :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably |pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: young as they are :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: we call them "fearless" |pg||
nt|sybarra: they are not 12 you know,  |pg||
nt|yuval10: now @h switch|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To please psrtner, South should overtake and plan @D Queen...|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer know no sane player will lead under Q of trump so he tried the K|pg||
nt|yuval10: and he also unblocked with the T@s , might be segnificent|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mcphee: can actually manage 11 tricks here for a decent score|pg||
nt|mcphee: best is to take @D finesse asap|pg||
nt|MolvaM: might make 12 tricks if he finesses @d|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes |pg||
nt|zoh:  Mono i @h einai kalo gyrisma|pg||
nt|eleni: Those teams are Nos 1 & 2 up to now (in the first 3 rounds) No 1 is Altinis Team, while Sapounakis team is 2nd|pg||
nt|chick: he won't feel bad for too long, there is simply no place for the losing diamond to go|pg||
nt|sybarra: and fairly seasoned |pg||
nt|yuval10: very nice|pg||
nt|sybarra: the needed switch but looking a dummy its easy|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on the face of it 2@S and 2@H can't be avoided|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Gerben42: how do you get 12|pg||
nt|cicus: at first sight N can be squeezed but he discards after dummy|pg||
nt|chick: unless ....  W leads the @D10 and N covers|pg||
nt|yuval10: if S would've play Q@s and @s then declarer win finesse the @c's and play AK@d and T@d discard @h|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mcphee: the @D finesse is clearly best choice|pg||
nt|lelos: paizei ton zozi gia K@c kai A@s|pg||
nt|haans: if 3@C did show minimum East had no cards for slam|pg||
nt|flash: i'm not as familiar with the goings on with Polish team, so if anyone has any inside information, by all means, let me know  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: and they consider themselves invulerable instead of non-vulerable sometimes   |pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL|pg||
nt|yuval10: the 3rd @h goes over the 9@d and just made|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|eleni: Please be with us, tomorrow at 17:00 CET and Sunday 9:30CET|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I think that is not a "thinking play"  .....these guys are thinking all the time |pg||
nt|rnmalik: now we know the play of T@S on trick one-all options open|pg||
pc|hT|nt|MolvaM: @d finesse is not extremely risky as he can discard his @h loser even if @d finesse loses|pg||
nt|eleni: yes zoh, a @h return would have been killing|pg||
nt|Gerben42: no entries for @C@D squeeze|pg||
nt|mcphee: @h yes a better defence, but with right view nothing matters|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he needs friendly breaks in all suits though|pg||
nt|mcphee: @D hook cash A, @H to hand and ruff @D loser|pg||
nt|mcphee: draw trumps and claim|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Gerben42: then you still lose a @H for 11|pg||
nt|eleni: with the 10@d return, he has chances|pg||
nt|lelos: +K@d fusika|pg||
nt|chick: E will have to stop now and try to trump some clubs|pg||
nt|haans: why cover the 10|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - the @D-suit by far too weak|pg||
nt|chick: I didn't say he should, only that it's the only possible hope for W|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Was just ONLY chance for making the contract|pg||
nt|haans: agree there|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s why S should overtake and play @D Queen|pg||
nt|chick: when you are outmanned, outgunned, and out of ideas, there is just one remaining hope ..... guile|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: will soon be overruffed|pg||
nt|sybarra: or "invisible" is the next piece of that joke |pg||
nt|sybarra: invincible, invisible, etc  |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mcphee: y|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW are the leading pair in the butler among the Dutch pairs|pg||
nt|yuval10: as you all ( might ) know, this tournement is all about picking up the Dutch team|pg||
nt|yuval10: for both Ostende ( euro. championship ) and the Bermuda Bowl the following year ( NET. are the host, therefor they've secure their place in it )|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome to Warren Spector |pg||
nt|yuval10: the dutch trails consisted of weekend sessions, in which EW won 1st place in, a training match against Russia. 1 or 2 weeks ago, and the current match vs Israel and Poland|pg||
nt|warrens:  hi all|pg||
nt|yuval10: hello Warren :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: N/S were Warren's team mates in the spingold |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Warren|pg||
nt|warrens:  looks like declarer has only reasonable line: finesse the club (low to jack to get to dummy) then double finesse the diamonds for a heart discard |pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|droopy17: kalo peximo|pg||
nt|eleni: wd John, he created a 3rd entry to his hand!|pg||

nt|warrens:  but it will cost him an extra undertrick ifwrong|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like 4 is now available|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chick: Yes, Hans, very astute and if S had seen that at the table, he would be a hero|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|chick: true, he would have to depend on the @H finesse then|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Gerben42: only way is a dummy reversal, ruff 3@C and win the @C9 as  12|pg||
nt|haans: 2 clubs + hearts = 3|pg||
pc|dA|nt|eleni: 9@s and let it ride...........|pg||
nt|cicus: this is not a good line anyway, a @D should have dbeen ducked first|pg||
nt|haans: ruff 1 more spade = dummy reversal|pg||
nt|chick: but if he draws trump loses another club instead|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mcphee: can ruff @C good but still needs to finesse @D|pg||
nt|eleni: he thought too long and played the wrong card:) that's Manolis Protonotarios:) when he plays fast, he is a great player|pg||

nt|mcphee: S prrfers to stress @D rather than bid 2@C|pg||
nt|mcphee: E might have taken time to dble 3@H|pg||
nt|lelos: now forcing with 5-4|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Group B|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Kotinas 47|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Roussos 33|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Panagaki 29|pg||

nt|vugraphzge: Argyrou 24|pg||
nt|petrosa: zozis doesn't know the fit|pg||
nt|petrosa: in the open room: 3@D-4@S-all pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: N will bid again |pg||
nt|rnmalik: good bid-but S has shown minimum|pg||
nt|sybarra: just how many?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: for me 5@S if not DBL|pg||
nt|yuval10: it all sounds to North like S has a singel @d|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe bids 5 @H "on the way" |pg||
nt|yuval10: in wonder if pass from south over 5@d showed indeed minimal values|pg||
nt|yuval10: *i|pg||
nt|sybarra: or forcing|pg||
mb|5H|an| |nt|eleni: Dimos Dionysopoulos is in a jam now|pg||
nt|mcphee: I would treat 3@D is highly invitational|pg||
nt|chick: 3@S alerted, might show spades and clubs, if so , now possible W will lead a club against a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: slam was not easy|pg||
nt|othered1: system didn't allow south to get his @C into the auction, so north is unlikely to find killling lead|pg||
nt|chick: any lead gives a trick, although clubs obviously best|pg||
mb|5S|nt|eleni: room|pg||
nt|cicus: it seems it is impossible to get to 6@C|pg||
nt|haans: open 1nt pass pass pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: wow|pg||
nt|MolvaM: nikos intended 3@d as forcing I guess?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@D wont catch too much in pairs|pg||
nt|mcphee: many N players would not bid 1@H after opening 1@C, but select 1NT instead|pg||
nt|zoh:  5@d kako score gia zeygi|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Q: what is the point of doubling 5@C when you already raised|pg||
nt|petrosa: where are the diamonds?|pg||
nt|eleni: quite a friendly lead from Fotis:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Fotis should find the 4@s now|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: sorry about the mistake |pg||
nt|haans: but ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: so I win this prize  (for what it is worth)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ok- a coke:)|pg||
mb|6C|an| |nt|MolvaM: I know many north players who wouldnt bid anything |pg||
nt|liarakos: hmm|pg||
nt|lelos: something wrong with bidding proly|pg||
nt|petrosa: it is difficult to find 7-2 fit nowdays|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard (South) is trying to hit the deck!!|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes i think the pass was forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: yuck|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H was not the best way to slam|pg||
nt|haans: np|pg||
nt|chick: what is the aggressive lead against a slam guideline?     lead away from the closest thing you have to a trick |pg||
nt|sybarra: I really like the bid 5 @H |pg||
mb|6S|nt|liarakos: i think 3@H is too much space consuming|pg||
nt|eleni: no girls at this table, and as you know @d are girls best friends|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: a nice play would have been the 10@c and a small @s to the 10|pg||
nt|rodal f: How to handlethe @D color by 3 missing? Here u are a nice site by %: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm|pg||
nt|haans: best way to get 2 :)|pg||
nt|chick: if I knew partner had both black suits, I would lead a club in preference to a spade|pg||
nt|chick: it does seem their system is getting them too high,  usually think of big club systems as keeping you low when responder is weakish|pg||
nt|chick: 4@C would have done it :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: i pass the N hand myself but understnad the need to bid|pg||
nt|bmkl: they didn't missed this one|pg||
nt|eleni: true, while at the other table Yiangos got a bit chicken|pg||
nt|cicus: E had two chances to bid the suit but failed to find them|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|chick: all moot now, S is signing off in 5|pg||
nt|othered1: will south duck the first @D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|petrosa: so more imps for Thessaloniki|pg||
nt|chick: well, good auction anyway, they found the right spot|pg||
nt|flash: again, many options...   |pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: including @d7 :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: he has indeed 4th @s and a good spade @s, but XX @d and all other points are garbage|pg||
pc|c7|nt|haans: cue in clubs then all easy|pg||
nt|haans: not far fetch|pg||
nt|othered1: it's not unprecedented for declarer to get this right|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice duck|pg||
nt|chick: wish my BIL students were here, took me about 3 weeks to convince them to duck the first diamond :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Right or wrong, he can say that he thought about it.|pg||
nt|warrens:  I like all the bids except 6@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: and perhaps that is why N should "respect" 5 @S    |pg||
nt|rnmalik: no doubt N has a good hand, after 3@S by S has 3 losers |pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 @C drives them to 6 @S   the club bid may be the one you hate?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lelos: my guess is +2|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petrosa: N must bid more, with so many@D|pg||
nt|rodal f: And S followed the book.|pg||
nt|flash: :)     perhaps the most straightforward would be to play on @Cs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: director has been called|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: 2 leads at the same time|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, should trust partner to go with an Ace and King or a stiff|pg||
nt|sybarra: at this level, yes I think so |pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|flash: on the lie of the cards, declarer could have afforded to win the first @H, but this is definitely safer|pg||
nt|flash: the alternative would be to play on @Ds; as we can see, that also works|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: clubs safer after the discard?|pg||
nt|flash: however, the entry situation looks to get quite tangled, if declarer goes after @Ds|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|petrosa: he didn't describe his hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice defence!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cicus: over 3@H he was probably obliged to bid his stopper|pg||
nt|othered1: Does ace give them an extra  undertrick?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|MolvaM: not much to play for here|pg||
nt|othered1: win, @S10 and south has to duck again|pg||
nt|chick: only hope now is to drop the @SQ in 2 tricks, which doesn't happen|pg||
nt|chick: right Ed, that works for an extra spade trick, but not an entry|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|chick: although can't argue with success, they *are* in the lead :)|pg||
nt|haans: strong point :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|eleni: a difficult decision for Mrs. Papypari|pg||
pc|d3|nt|MolvaM: just claim and get it over with|pg||
nt|eleni: in spite of the helpful lead a 600 is a bad score in pairs|pg||
nt|mcphee: more to the piont is how can you not lead @C?|pg||
nt|eleni: Papyraki|pg||
nt|othered1: wrong about that with this @C play.  YOu're right about @SQ|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|petrosa: +8|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s8|pc|dK|pg||
nt|eleni: so the system worked in this case:)|pg||
nt|haans: nice|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In this board - a good rule/lesson. When declarer asks for the @D King, doÂ´nt even think about playing the Ace!|pg||
nt|chick: so he played for @SQ in N|pg||
nt|warrens:  declarer praying for a miracle|pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1|pg||
pc|d4|nt|MolvaM: they believed the 5@c bid|pg||
nt|ghionis: give trick back|pg||
nt|ghionis: he is very polite":)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|mcphee: well S gets all the blame for this hand, N contriubted just a little|pg||
nt|MolvaM: a simple 2@s reverse from south would be enough. but anyway|pg||
nt|cicus: from his point of view West could have held a long @D suit|pg||
nt|haans: thta 2@C prempt was effective|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|droopy17: -2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|zlatan: difficultto find it after the 2@h opening|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|petrosa: if you have spades you have no fear:)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||

nt|petrosa: it was another flat board:)|pg||
nt|liarakos: 6@d at the open room|pg||
nt|ghionis: oh only the viewgrafer was:)|pg||
nt|haans: second slam try|pg||
nt|haans: with u (no joke 2)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Double-dumme many tricks N/S here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I mean, that a declarer playing his sington King - he has NOT 2 or 3 small in the suit. He DREAMS about finding an opponent, who will take the trick|pg||
nt|flash: given the @H lead (and the split of that suit), i'd think that the odds of South having KQx of @Cs are quite slim|pg||
nt|chick: was actually pretty good play by W ... unlucky but he gave himself some chances|pg||
nt|othered1: 16 imps for the 730 on board 2.  EW were doubled making in OR.|pg||
nt|othered1: I really like NS's card so far.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|petrosa: playing natural...|pg||
nt|haans: 6 minor|pg||
nt|flash: note that @Ds wouldn't have to be 3-3 for that suit to set up - Hx in either hand would suffice (declarer had all the spots)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: Give me that @h suit, and @cKQx and I'd definitely bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|petrosa: they will find another slam|pg||
nt|eleni: bad board for E-W if they go up high|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S vs 3@H|pg||
mb|1N|nt|MolvaM: a very heavy pass from east|pg||
nt|Gerben42: healthy pass :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: perfectly sensible to pass E I think|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yep|pg||

nt|droopy17: ne|pg||
nt|lelos: :)|pg||
nt|lelos: dificult not impossible|pg||
nt|lelos: 1nt or 2@s ?|pg||
nt|liarakos: North opened 1@S|pg||
nt|liarakos: it was easier|pg||
nt|eleni: 3@d-1 were played in the open room|pg||
nt|rodal f: In my eyes a mad 1@D bid when EW ain't limiteded|pg||
nt|cicus: 6@D to be preferred|pg||
nt|haans: not passing tiome South|pg||
nt|othered1: That's an interesting 2-way opening.  I wonder if NS were parpared for it|pg||
nt|chick: didn't deter S from bidding spades though|pg||
nt|othered1: North has a lot of information and might work out what's going on.|pg||
nt|sybarra: whew,  that was fairly agressive of S |pg||
mb|2S|nt|eleni: after all they are vul|pg||
nt|haans: for sure|pg||
nt|cicus: although it is hard to guess in which suit the opponents can arrange a ruff|pg||
nt|haans: not easy|pg||
nt|yuval10: now 3@h from S perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: but you have more @Ds than @Cs|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mcphee: no majors|pg||
nt|lelos: 2! gazzili|pg||
nt|lelos: 2@c|pg||
nt|chick: so does West :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Do we know the range for east's opening?|pg||
nt|yuval10: or just 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: 2@D some trick bid?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I guess 2@C shows a fit|pg||
nt|lelos: dionusopoulos is well trained :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW have 3@S= or +1 and 4@C=|pg||
nt|flash: :)   |pg||
nt|flash: most pairs will have a check-back sequence available here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|haans: to overtrick NS at or 1 down is good|pg||
mb|p|nt|petrosa: 2@D=9+|pg||
nt|petrosa: 8+|pg||
nt|haans: and they have @DA and not @CA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: where will this end?|pg||
nt|othered1: Still no certainty from west's perspective that east doesn't have the long @C hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lelos: gia pekse|pg||
nt|rodal f: OK Tasos:))|pg||
nt|petrosa: 2@C is FG|pg||
nt|jcone: makes without a hearts lead   K  will find it though|pg||
nt|zlatan: just made :)|pg||
nt|cicus: I would not have predicted the 2NT rebid even if I had 5 guesses|pg||
nt|haans: normal to miss this slam|pg||
nt|cicus: you can get there using standard methods by opening 1@C then reversing into @Ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: S called the director|pg||
nt|haans: i agree 3nt should have been played by west|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: I'm on the other side of the screen though|pg||
nt|cicus: for what reason?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: sorry, can't tell|pg||
nt|haans: only reason i can find for 2@H is that 1@H had been relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|petrosa: 3@D=16-18hcp|pg||
nt|lelos: mistell|pg||
nt|zlatan: he makes with @h lead also|pg||
nt|eleni: @h return?|pg||
nt|haans: screens and online = pressure on|pg||
nt|flash: (some will have both a check-back and a sign-off sequence available)|pg||
nt|flash: Board 2 ended one trick better for E-W in the Open Room|pg||
nt|chick: 5@H ok if he can pick up the @HQ|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good stop|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Gerben42: so he is stuck|pg||
nt|Gerben42: she|pg||

nt|MolvaM: eleni said EW are sweet ladies, so they wont trick us :)|pg||

nt|zoh:  2NTkalo symbolaio|pg||
nt|eleni: beware of the sweet ladies:):)|pg||
nt|mcphee: may have been better to pop an honor card from table|pg||
nt|zoh:  :) Sosta Eleni|pg||
nt|jcone: good sacrifice in 5 hearts   not found by Christnitsa|pg||
nt|othered1: north thinking that double might be Lightner?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|eleni: they always know what they are doing:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Taso, by the end of this tournament, Frank will speak Greek:)|pg||
nt|lelos: 50 years ago this would be a passed out board i think|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ain't we happy that things have happen at the bridge:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Taso 50 years ago anyone would have opened 1@h with E's hand:):) dreadful but true|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will it end -1 or -2 by a @S ruff and miss the @D?|pg||
nt|lelos: i think down 2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Didn't the say min 13HP by that time Eleni? So 12HP ain't good enough|pg||
nt|eleni: ohhhhhhhhhhhhh Nickkkkkkkkkkkkkk pls play|pg||
nt|rodal f: The nick name was Nick?:)|pg||
nt|eleni: nickd|pg||
nt|eleni: and yes Frank 12 and a dbltn|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still it was 13HP. Later they conted doubbletons etc.|pg||
nt|eleni: remember pls our good old Goren:):)|pg||
nt|rodal f: But by that time not with a honor included. It came later.|pg||
nt|eleni: and then Albarran and his 5-cards majors and canape|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Director called by W for delay by S|pg||
nt|lelos: this is standard for N/S|pg||
nt|eleni: South, Nick is still thinking:)|pg||
nt|haans: @D right|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: 5 imps to the Dutch :)|pg||
nt|flash: 3@S was allowed to make on Board 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: S left the table to visit the toilet|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: or bathroom, whatever is better English :P|pg||
nt|flash: we'd think that North had a plan in mind when he continued with 3@C|pg||
nt|flash: but, having found that the partnership has two 8-card fits, he's apparently thinking of bidding more|pg||
pc|hK|nt|MolvaM: I expect many players to open the east hand, then hard to stop before 3nt|pg||
nt|haans: @C right|pg||
nt|haans: @H right|pg||
nt|hawe45:  They get 200 here|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hawe45:  But not with this shift|pg||
nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|flash: i'd think the 3 small @Hs and the lack of shortness would deter him, but...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcphee: our E is hoping to win the J in hand|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|petrosa: after this lead he wii not make it|pg||
nt|flash: interesting (and unanticipated)|pg||
nt|warrens:  agreed.  don't want to punish partner for a non-vul intervention|pg||
nt|sybarra: some may consider 2 @H with W hand |pg||
pc|c2|nt|petrosa: without dbl-Mr Karlaftis is afraid?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|rodal f: WD|pg||
nt|eleni: was worth the thinking?|pg||
nt|jcone: P misclicked?   now makes |pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|mcphee: another good think about splitting the @S honors is N is more likely to return the suit if they win it\|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so making 2nt will be a good score I expect|pg||
nt|mcphee: N should find the @D shift now I think|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: hi tez|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi tez |pg||
nt|tez: hi Bob ve merhaba molvam:)|pg||

nt|eleni: welcome Tez:):) we have been waiting for you:)|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, being 'on air' may add to the anxiety tremendously|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: nothing is easier than errors in defense|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: to get 9 needed deep @D finesse|pg||

mb|p|nt|eleni: Murat, ALL Greek ladies are sweet:) no need to say that:)|pg||
nt|tez: i dont agree with dbl|pg||
nt|mcphee: nor do I|pg||
nt|tez: my second choise 1@s|pg||
nt|Gerben42: unusual bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: Don't N have a clear negX?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|MolvaM: ahh ok, I should write it down somewhere|pg||

mb|2C|nt|MolvaM: does north bid 1@s with that all the time? or only against ladies?|pg||

nt|haans: 12 top tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like support X |pg||
mb|2D|nt|Gerben42: now east alerts and west panics|pg||
nt|Gerben42: oh 1@S was a transfer|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or does it have an other meaning?|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: many would have tried it but ...|pg||
nt|chick: not nice to be on lead against a strong NT when you have scattered unsupported honors|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: west has over stated the values of this hand|pg||
nt|Gerben42: half the fun then|pg||
nt|MolvaM: still a peaceful contract|pg||
nt|eleni: by N-S of course:)|pg||
nt|lelos: oops|pg||
nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|flash: South's X shows @S length|pg||
nt|sybarra: does Jan bid 2 @S or 3 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: no way he can sit |pg||
mb|3C|nt|MolvaM: we were expecting something like 3@cXXX|pg||
nt|petrosa: -1|pg||
nt|zlatan: no reopening??|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: no|pg||
nt|cicus: they may have problems unveiling their strength|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seems OK 500 insted of &xx-something|pg||
nt|chick: does the X also establish @Cs as a real suit, I wonder|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: East knows that pd never has anything|pg||
nt|haans: i think 2nt did show extra|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6xx|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not sure last hand was all luck.  EW's funny methods had set NS up for a big fall, but they weren't able to capitalize on it.  Says something about their methods and judgment ...|pg||
nt|othered1: to me.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: Verhees stated X on 3@s would be penalty, v Prooijen wasn't sure|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@s from E? I think he have to|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: This is the 3th time I operate a match played by them, and in all these matches they frequently fail on their system|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 2nT might be the key bid although I don't know its meaning|pg||
nt|chick: I think I would have led a small trump, under the theory that anything else would give away a trick|pg||
nt|haans: many would have lead the single :))|pg||
nt|haans: hard to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  double probably just showing a good hand, not direct penalty|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petrosa: one down is good bridge|pg||
nt|sybarra: or "cards" |pg||
nt|sybarra: the "do something smart pard" X |pg||
pc|hA|nt|hawe45:  OH - 5 @C - no make|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mcphee: the t/o dble was getting the e/w pair off to the right fit had E bid|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: they did it|pg||
nt|flash: North's X apparently shows 3-card spt|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|flash: Board 4 turned into a 2-IMP gain for Netherlands!!  E-W reached 5@D in the Open Room|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @d lead had made it more difficult for the declarer|pg||
nt|othered1: @D lead would have, but why should north find it, since south didn't really bid @D, just transferred to @H, I think.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Gerben42: @D is right? @S counts more|pg||
nt|tez: usually 2@s after an initial dbl is a stronger hand|pg||
nt|tez: with E i wld definitely bid 2@d over 1@s|pg||
nt|chick: good lead ... partner very unlikely to have an entry to lead hearts thru declarer|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|rodal f: Wander if the X and X from N made S belive more HPs at N. Don't have there CC|pg||
nt|lelos: i think 1@d shows unbalanced hand hence the 1@c|pg||
nt|eleni: no CCs available today, I hope there will be for the final 4s|pg||
nt|lelos: all other natural|pg||
nt|rodal f: After input from some specs: It seems that S took to much vitamins before the last bid:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: W thinking and check CC of NS|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|haans: more clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 3 the 4 spades played from other side,  making 4 |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|liarakos: no swing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what else than playing @s?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: no clue|pg||
nt|othered1: west still needs to find the winning @D play and I'm not sure low to 10 is the best in a vacuum.  We'll have to see what other information he has at that point.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ghionis: things are going bad for Altinis now|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|jcone: 4 clubs doubled down  a few    Maria=Salvation Army|pg||
nt|eleni: They play behind screens, yet they have 90 minutes for the 10 boards of this session......... though they are pretty behind time|pg||
nt|haans: now a make ruff a clubs|pg||
nt|flash: this appears to depend on an inspired guess in @Ss|pg||
nt|flash: and should now go down 1|pg||
nt|flash: aha - some of you are more awake than i - unless the @DK is dropped, declarer will probably end down 2|pg||
nt|flash: we'd assume that Jansma is trying to decide whether he needs to lead a @D here|pg||

nt|othered1: west too the "in a vacuum" play for 3 tricks on this holding.  There were other considerations,  however|pg||
nt|yuval10: yet another big hand for W|pg||
mb|1C|an|12-14 bal or strong|nt|MolvaM: and west would know that diamonds are her best friend anyway|pg||
nt|eleni: Last board of this segment so see you in a few minutes|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt-3nt|pg||
nt|flash: the West hand is a problem for 'standard' bidders|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|eleni: As we all know Bobolakis and George Karlaftis both are teams' players. They rarely risk their contracts|pg||
nt|eleni: Last board of this Championship for this table|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H-3nt|pg||
nt|othered1: I hate that west hand for 1N, but need a hep partnership to open otherwise.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: no no sry|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mcphee: N wants to bid more|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4@c is a good save|pg||
nt|mcphee: so is 3N:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: against 140|pg||
nt|tez: 3nt pls:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4@C bound to get dbled|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3N will not be|pg||
nt|eleni: 4@d would be a bad bid by Dimos|pg||
nt|tez: trust your partner:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt gets doubled faster|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but north would run probably|pg||
nt|chick: that will warn them off of 3N|pg||
nt|haans: best you can do is double|pg||
nt|flash: Jansma starts with 1@D in order to have a rebid should partner respond 1@S or 1NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this nt is really heavy at the front|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: many play that 1@D - 2@C denies a major|pg||
nt|cicus: hence the 1@H response|pg||
nt|flash: Jansma will discourage a @D continuation (?)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bmkl: no risk no return Eleni :)|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt not easy with @D lead |pg||
nt|haans: not that farfetched|pg||
nt|sybarra: E just not finding his hand attractive |pg||
nt|warrens:  so W has 17+ with a least 5 @S's |pg||
nt|warrens:  nice to have a strong club to get out quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: you would be surprised if N dbled here and S bids 3N how often they save in 4@S|pg||
nt|othered1: lucky @D position for NT is unlucky for 5@C.  Best spot single dummy is 4@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: is S really thinking?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: yes he was|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mcphee: S might have stepped in with 2@H here|pg||
nt|petrosa: another -1|pg||
nt|petrosa: bad luck|pg||
nt|liarakos: i am not sure|pg||
nt|eleni: Last board of this Segment:) In about 15 minutes we'll watch the final and most interesting ending of this championship:)|pg||
nt|flash: note the lead of the K - an attempt to hold the lead and let partner tell you what to do next|pg||
nt|flash: so West's cards should be suit preference, with a middle card suggesting a continuation of @Ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: they seem to play low disc, as paulissen already held the @h4|pg||
nt|flash: we'll see if the partnership is on the same wave length|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mcphee: a little soft, but what the hect|pg||
nt|cicus: has to decide if @Hs are 4-4 or @S finesse is on|pg||
nt|haans: but spade finesse|pg||
nt|cicus: @Ds, I mean|pg||
nt|cicus: 4-4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No 2-@D bid to me - very bad, IÂ´m sorry. Could stop opponents from bidding an unmakeable 3 NT, can cost 300 against nothing etc.|pg||
nt|haans: really open 1nt in better Never be inlove with majors|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h on 4-3(!)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|harmon: If declarer plays a high club from his hand south shd drop Q|pg||
nt|othered1: And with the right partner you might get there if you can squeeze a 1@H opening out of the west hand.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|petrosa: Q@h|pg||
nt|petrosa: and many -|pg||
nt|liarakos: maybe x @H and many down|pg||
nt|cicus: if @D5 led, it strongly suggests a 5-card suit|pg||
nt|haans: playing will take time|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK, then 2 @D worked good - the lead|pg||
nt|chick: 3N bid at the other table, but made without a diamond lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|eleni: George you are right, Nick Perdikaris is an aggressive player:)|pg||
nt|ghionis: :)|pg||
nt|eleni: but in this case he decided to use the law of total tricks|pg||
nt|eleni: and it will work|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cicus: because of rule of 11|pg||
nt|haans: @D4 = five cards|pg||
nt|flash: good shift|pg||
nt|warrens:  I always say: it's ok to think, even if there's nothing to really consider|pg||
nt|sybarra: if it went 2 @C my guess it would go X,  and the doubling would start |pg||
pc|c2|nt|MolvaM: yes we are surprised :)|pg||
nt|eleni: true, this is why on board 16 they lost an IMP|pg||
nt|othered1: Here niether major was ever in play.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|tez: 1 down|pg||
nt|mcphee: things lay well for declarer|pg||
nt|liarakos: 5@H x in the open|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|eleni: a wild bidding:)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|liarakos: -2 probably so 11 imps to Levi|pg||
nt|cicus: on the run of @Cs S will have to find discards, however|pg||
nt|haans: specially attention to J and 10|pg||
nt|chick: being doubled does have that effect :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mcphee: W overstepped hi bounds with this 4@S bid|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - but here that danger didÂ´nt exist - S had bid NT allready|pg||
nt|haans: withour @D bid from W|pg||
nt|othered1: Though this is a h and that would challenge most methods|pg||
nt|sybarra: question Warren, is how much energy to expend on this sort of hand |pg||
nt|yuval10: N wants @d|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mcphee: good point, but as @D run nothing helps|pg||
nt|eleni: 3dx=|pg||
nt|harmon: true I just pointed it out cause Stevo did that to me to beat me, I almost got it right cause it was Stevo|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eleni: not this board:):) that was for the operator of the other table:):) board 5@h|pg||
nt|eleni: in the open room E-W on this one scored +1 for 450|pg||
nt|flash: Jansma couldn't be sure that the @D was cashing, so he shifted|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tez: w shld not decide here|pg||
nt|mcphee: not sure what he was thinking, but this is not what you do|pg||
nt|chick: exactly, so the diamond bid was kinda necessary, even if only to direct the lead|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|s8|nt|MolvaM: now we know that west is a certified overbidder|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|warrens:  if W finesses, S gets another ruff, that's why he went up|pg||
pc|s9|nt|haans: some say attiude lead better at nt for not tell if 4-4 of 5-3 in suit|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ghionis: bad timing for altinis he went down in this|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mcphee: so reccomended is Q@C now not 10:)|pg||
nt|harmon: rofl yup|pg||
nt|jcone: no chance of Queen play now|pg||
nt|mcphee: which would have a good shot had he overcalled:)|pg||
nt|lelos: another 4 imps for altinis here since 9 tricks are easy|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|liarakos: oops|pg||
nt|cicus: I agree|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d5|nt|rodal f: ? Kill the cat. And @S|pg||
nt|lelos: not very carefull play by coach|pg||
nt|haans: need spade K10 at west to make|pg||
pc|c5|nt|tez: with a bal hand with  defensive values in @d and limit opening hand|pg||
nt|MolvaM: they are sweet ladies remember|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I guess east had an opinion about 4@H|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|cicus: and 4th best does not tell the quality of the suit, making a switch harder|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|MolvaM: so they expect their opps to be polite in defence|pg||
nt|eleni: no way to save the -1:(|pg||
nt|bmkl: -2 maybe|pg||
nt|bmkl: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Thanks all, see you in about 15 min :)           @H|pg||
pc|s6|nt|eleni: true, he had to continue with a @s|pg||
nt|haans: sort of squeeze|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cicus: S could have pitched a spade but then all @S are high|pg||
nt|haans: do not need finesse in spades|pg||
nt|cicus: E probably went for @Hs|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: director signed the score on the 6th board|pg||
nt|haans: good defense|pg||

nt|cicus: uhh, I would feel terrible in EW shoes|pg||
mb|1H|nt|liarakos: only 3N here|pg||
nt|flash: 5 and 6 in as pushes...   on 6, the Open Room played 4@S - this room ended, a bit strangely, in 4NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: interesting hand|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mcphee: 1@C?|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  hello|pg||
nt|rodal f: a 10IMPer out the window when NS got there chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: Verhees uses a Stop card for alerting :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: brd 4 as i said W did open 1@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: guess i know him good enough then :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: KJ@D right cards for S|pg||
nt|warrens:  W must be thinking about 3N or X.  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: and lost 4 imps:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|MolvaM: polish?|pg||
nt|eleni: @h@h we must point out that the young lady in South, Christine Syrakopoulou, is an excellent player|pg||
nt|lelos: 2@s intermidiate|pg||
nt|petrosa: the bidding system of levi-stavrinos is not perfect|pg||
nt|petrosa: they play 3NT|pg||
nt|cicus: a pity we don't know what happened|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: they are Greeks:)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|petrosa: -2 but you never know:)|pg||
nt|haans: assume x was negative |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: I'll try to find out when I have time|pg||
nt|aldek: club bids were all relays|pg||
nt|aldek: but you need an agreement about the redouble, another relay or a proposition to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: ahh transfer bids:)|pg||
nt|tez: lead directing may be:)|pg||
nt|eleni: how very true Bob:) All of them are Greeks:):)|pg||
nt|haans: pass 6+|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, denying points :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry they won 4imps:)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|harmon: how young|pg||
nt|petrosa: in 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: hard to believe N would balance 3@C atht eh other table|pg||
nt|mcphee: here N was more tuned in that e/w may not fit so well|pg||
nt|jcone: Edgar   is 30   young enough?|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: Im an old goat just checking|pg||
nt|eleni: a little older than Christine:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: quite the lead|pg||
nt|petrosa: they didn't find the double fit, nor the slam|pg||
nt|flash: if 1@D showed @Hs (as seems likely), South's X probably shows 3-card spt|pg||
nt|aldek: you can make 6NT on this hand|pg||
nt|aldek: 6 in both spades and diamonds is doomed|pg||
nt|aldek: Kwiecien has a choice, show his diamonds or set spades as trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzge: paizoume twra thn 39, meta thn 38 :)|pg||
nt|cicus: bd6 suggested EW were playing natural system but now it seems I was wrong and it's a strong club|pg||
nt|warrens:  avoided taking a unilateral position.  but 5@C will be down 1|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chick: a red flag works too :)|pg||
nt|othered1: only 7 top tricks with poor @C break.  Let's see how declarer attacks the 8th.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: Maybe an medieval cannon will do it too|pg||
nt|warrens:  3N would have been down at least 2|pg||
nt|warrens:  North very disciplined not to bid 4@S over the neg X|pg||
pc|s5|nt|petrosa: afterall they have only 30hcp|pg||
nt|eleni: At the other table, on board 19, Judy Levi plays 3NT, so yes, some IMPs for Chliapas|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S = weak 4@S = firm|pg||
nt|chick: Multumiri, Riinu :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seems to have been a @C-lead in OR|pg||
nt|chick: always nice to know what's going on besides the bridge :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: it was about bridge:P|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mcphee: poor W now has a problem|pg||
nt|mcphee: no cost as it happens|pg||
nt|eleni: a good save in 6@d|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mcphee: he should have just overcalled 1@S and be done with it|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes that would have been -1|pg||
nt|sybarra: both rooms were in 6 @S on bd 5|pg||
pc|s4|nt|tez: suspicious dbl by west with singleton @h|pg||
nt|eleni: oh ok:) As Effie told us, they picked up board 39, before 38:)|pg||
nt|flash: Ace and a @H to beat this?|pg||
nt|flash: if, indeed, North has shown @H length and South 3-card spt, Jansma will find it|pg||
nt|flash: if, instead, the meaning of the bids is different, there's no particular reason to lead the suit|pg||
nt|aldek: now they will reach a slam|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|mcphee: yes, it was lucky N bid|pg||
nt|polyvlakas: this should be an easy board....with a diffirent bidding|pg||
nt|eleni: and a bad X|pg||
nt|bmkl: nice agressive bid by Fotis|pg||
nt|cicus: can't be either (no X from west)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|rodal f: A good shot but only for a push|pg||
nt|cicus: so I am totally in the dark|pg||
nt|haans: this is good bridge Strong clubs and opps bid game|pg||
nt|chick: besides the bidding and play :P|pg||
nt|warrens:  E thinking how to make this assuming the @H K is onside|pg||
nt|sybarra: you mean off side k of @H?|pg||
nt|sybarra: wait till he finds @C 4/1 |pg||
nt|warrens:  no, he's has to assume it's onside and still would have work to do.  of course, here it will be more a matter of not going down 2|pg||
nt|sybarra: going to go check on poland match  be back shortly |pg||
nt|warrens:  if the heart K is onside, the best line might be to take an immediate heart finesse, and assuming it works, cash the heart Ace and ruff a heart High|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|aldek: mam jeszcze troche pracy i wiecej czasu na brydza|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mcphee: or E would be bidding @H|pg||
nt|haans: will lose imps here|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mcphee: S needs to find a @C now|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok, this line has the advantage of not needing hearts to break.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|haans: is there anything but bridge?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|petrosa: when the two pairs play the same suit, someone is wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: about the 6th board:wrong explanations given at the table. not sure of details|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: sorry that there was 3S for a while, it's 5|pg||
pc|c3|nt|eleni: yes, but I can not guess what E-W would have done, had Karlaftis bid 6@d|pg||
nt|haans: Trommel do not understand that play|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|cicus: oh, I see, you were joking with us :)|pg||
nt|cicus: is this real?|pg||
nt|cicus: west ducked @S10?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: I'm sorry I lost this game|pg||
nt|cicus: no problem|pg||
nt|haans: not really|pg||
pc|c7|nt|eleni: let's hope Maria Panagaki won't return a @c|pg||
nt|cicus: normal result|pg||
pc|s7|pc|cK|nt|MolvaM: defence dropped a few tricks here|pg||
nt|mcphee: W refused to lead a @S and now it will cost him big time|pg||
nt|bmkl: they are vulnerable|pg||
nt|eleni: exactly but I suppose this will be a swing|pg||
nt|chick: maybe trying to unblock for his partner?   but it certainly went wrong this time|pg||
nt|flash: on Board 7, 3@S was other-sided in the Open Room and came home - 8 more IMPs to Netherlands|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|petrosa: now we know who is wrong|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lelos: 3nt by maestro was the one that lured n/s|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|eleni: Maria is a very sweet lady|pg||
nt|mcphee: once a @H is not played E should have a good idea what is going on|pg||
nt|polyvlakas: misclick|pg||
pc|d8|nt|tez: final spot was right after a couple of misbids:)|pg||
nt|liarakos: -2 nv against 3NT vuln is ok|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|warrens:  I like a spade now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petrosa: in all times|pg||
nt|lelos: -2 is 6 back to sapounakis|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Gerben42: why misbids|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
mc|10|nt|warrens:  no, I take it back, spade does make it possible to make, so had to play something else|pg||

nt|rodal f: Hi Thanassis:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Last board for today. See you tommorow :)|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  a lost opp for EW in other room|pg||
nt|petrosa: usally it is not good habit to lead A in no trump without good suit|pg||

nt|cicus: I apologize for disturbing you|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  anyway, no way to make it with heart K offside|pg||
mb|1C|an| |nt|mcphee: possible failing slam here|pg||
nt|ghionis: they have to wait for Argyrou result now|pg||
nt|cicus: good result for NS in OR|pg||

mb|1S|nt|mcphee: 6@S has a slight chance|pg||

mb|d|nt|MolvaM: a nice slam hand|pg||
nt|eleni: indeed Bod and so did the other table 6@h-1|pg||
nt|mcphee: but any slam should fail|pg||
nt|mcphee: 6@S also fails, but it is a better spot than 6@H|pg||
nt|harmon: 1h -4c shd avoid slam|pg||
nt|mcphee: geee harmon, it would not stop me|pg||
nt|harmon: well nuttin stops you|pg||
nt|mcphee: too many controls in s hand|pg||

nt|cicus: ah they have the methods here as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: provided they want to Tez:):)|pg||

nt|lelos: very good slam|pg||
nt|polyvlakas: without the 2 queens, it would be a normal vurnerable weak2|pg||
nt|haans: or not :)|pg||
nt|cicus: 5@C is only down on the unlikely @D lead|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@S?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Gooed morning everyone |pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: ah - transfer|pg||
nt|rodal f: Been nice to meet u. See u tomorrow at 17.00CET|pg||
nt|eleni: right Thanasi, 6 are there all the time, so let us see if Fotis and Aris will get there|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  the strong hand finds out 5-5-2-1 in West and there is a play even with 0 points|pg||
nt|haans: good cards in spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: yee old mexican 2@D|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the inventor of transfer bids must be rich with all the copyright money he gets|pg||
nt|jcone: 2 @C  game force|pg||
nt|mcphee: must be some form of gazilli|pg||
nt|petrosa: in the open room|pg||
nt|lelos: hmm|pg||
nt|rodal f: Pass and 10 tricks on RD|pg||
nt|haans: sure|pg||
nt|flash: we've confirmed that 1@D on the last hand was an xfer to @Hs; given Jansma's lead, we'd assume that South's X showed values, not necessarily 3-card @H spt|pg||
nt|othered1: are we into a relay structure?  Can anyone translate?|pg||
nt|aldek: 2@D means hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: Good morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 6@C seems nice|pg||
nt|lelos: not even in 3:)|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  difficult to get there with natural system|pg||
nt|hawe45:  On a good day - playing @S to one looser - we get 110|pg||
nt|aldek: hallo David|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tez: 6@c is perfect|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 3@D must show @C then?!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6nt is more exciting|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I'm right - getting the hang of this|pg||
nt|harmon: Im told NS play the nunes/fantoni system|pg||
nt|petrosa: not 3NT |pg||
nt|othered1: has that look to it|pg||
nt|chick: didn't 1@C show 5 spades and 4 minor a while ago?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jcone: the Double should put brakes on|pg||
nt|petrosa: it is easier if you know 52 cards|pg||
nt|liarakos: -1 so 19-9 to Capa final|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that was 2@c|pg||
nt|othered1: That was 2@C|pg||
nt|chick: oh, sorrrryyyy|pg||
nt|garnetts: Its interesting to me how often a trump lead against these partscore deals is right--even with a dangerous holding|pg||
nt|aldek: will go down 1 or 2, but both 2@H and 3@D make easily|pg||
pc|s6|nt|MolvaM: we want slams that make on a finesse, squeeze, throw-in etc|pg||
nt|mcphee: wow, 4@H opposite a GF strikes me as a very poor bid|pg||
nt|harmon: north doesnt have enuff to move|pg||
nt|petrosa: with clubs 2-2 slam is good:)|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: W doesn't want to play game even against 14 from P|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|haans: not easier to find|pg||
nt|othered1: They do canape with some openers.|pg||
nt|othered1: 41S looks as good a spot as any, especially with the @S pips.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the tradidional play in @s with a small from dummy when W is declarer:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Here it is simply neutral to lead a trump|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ghionis: @S lead to go down|pg||
nt|cicus: lead quite sensible|pg||
nt|flash: if anyone can find a link to the N-S convention card, some of these mysteries might be solved   :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mcphee: my lord|pg||
pc|d5|nt|MolvaM: not very enterprising|pg||
nt|mcphee: N did all he could I suppose|pg||
nt|mcphee: the strong hand bids like they have nothing, the weak hand pressed on with key card:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 12 tricks if S plays @sK|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|cicus: looked like N was short in @Ds|pg||
pc|s8|nt|MolvaM: maybe because they play against the president|pg||
nt|tez: and 6 nt with open hands|pg||
nt|lelos: i like a 3@c reopenig with maestro's hand|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|mcphee: S is none too pleased I suspect|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder what east knows at th is point and why west is thinking? |pg||
nt|othered1: What leeway would west have in an auction like this, unless he feels it has gone off the tracks somewhere?  Or do I totally misunderstand what's been going on here.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W cannot play the mathematical correct way (run @s9) because of too few entries|pg||
pc|s9|nt|MolvaM: no president likes if her opps make a slam against her on vugraf|pg||
nt|eleni: let us hope that Maria Panagaki will get the hint|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a feeling we missed a lot of alerts|pg||
nt|haans: good lead for 110|pg||
nt|othered1: of course a @C lead beats slam, no matter how declarer plays trumps|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|chrisky: nice pass by fotis|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW are in the best contract|pg||

nt|eleni: don;t worry, 1 more round is followin 10 minutes after this last board|pg||
nt|animeshraj: this cant be a NF 4@C|pg||
nt|othered1: To understand the defense, we need to know what west has shown, it might be very explicit.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|mcphee: well maria is going to be unhappy this goes down|pg||
nt|mcphee: she asked if parnter held Q of trumps, and then bid slam anyway:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: must be in hope of a low @D lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: missing 4 trumps including queen you are still more than 50% to make|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|eleni: well, Christine can do magic and put to sleep opps:)|pg||
nt|polyvlakas: protonotar did not overcall |pg||

nt|othered1: any specifics on high cards/controls?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: with 8-12 hcp|pg||
nt|othered1: ty|pg||
nt|othered1: so what would west have been thinking of over 4@S?|pg||
mc|9|nt|petrosa: after the cue 4@C is forcing|pg||

nt|hawe45:  - so we take the 140|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  4@S and 5@H both down 1|pg||
nt|warrens:  the law in action: 19 trumps and 19 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mcphee: @D singleton I mean|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|haans: not if @CJ lead is covered|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Both players have been warned - two of their kings are worthless|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In fact N/S here have 10 + 7 HCP - and a game needs around 26|pg||

pc|d4|nt|haans: uppercut?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||

nt|cicus: and it will reveal @S position at the same time|pg||
nt|cicus: unless E plays a very deep game|pg||
nt|haans: but still a make|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: not lost yet.. S is thinking|pg||
nt|haans: we all tend to do than :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|MolvaM: so hard to lead from AQ holding but nort could have tried a @s lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: The Q@H from east would have been much better from East--clear suit preference |pg||
pc|h3|nt|MolvaM: another good score for the president|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|flash: an attempt to beat the contract, which gave away an extra overtrick|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s8|pc|hQ|nt|chick: textbook defense|pg||

nt|haans: yep|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cicus: I don't think discarding was best|pg||

mb|p|nt|mcphee: and if she can avoid playing @S here it may continue|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: perfect no @S partial today|pg||
nt|mcphee: seems the popular choice will be 4@H game |pg||
mb|1C|an| |nt|tez: 4@h|pg||
nt|haans: thats is not a negative double|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mcphee: which is what I would be bidding|pg||
nt|flash: the dreaded Multi - weak 2 in a major|pg||
mb|2C|an|!d|nt|MolvaM: and 5@h now?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what hands, the dealer slightly off colour today:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: many open 1NT with the N hand nowadays|pg||
nt|warrens:  cute 1@C in 3rd hand by E at favorable|pg||
mb|2D|nt|cicus: as in OR|pg||
nt|flash: 4@C asks partner to xfer to his suit by bidding one under it|pg||
nt|aldek: dutchies stretch to bid on every hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: An unusual treatment -- but it will have disrupted NS |pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|chick: I certainly play it as penalty|pg||
nt|haans: good by Kolk to pass 3@C|pg||
nt|haans: when all bid game is rare|pg||
nt|chick: if 2@C was natural, then he should have passed 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: what do you bid with east hand?4@c?|pg||
nt|cicus: I am not one of them with a small side doubleton|pg||
nt|haans: wrong hand declaring|pg||
nt|cicus: but N was apparently forced to bid NT anyway|pg||
nt|haans: many say 2@C STAYMAN for ever|pg||
nt|flash: this allows South to protect his tenaces|pg||
nt|flash: a 4@D call would ask opener to bid his major (and tend to deny tenaces)|pg||
nt|aldek: partner is a passed hand, and you are white against red|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: dble very good choice|pg||
nt|MolvaM: this could go for 800|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@C with this nice distribution... dubious|pg||
nt|mcphee: i have no guts to make that sort of weak jump tez|pg||
nt|haans: in sweden 1nt had been natural for 60 years|pg||
nt|haans: with or without 5 cards major|pg||
nt|flash: the @H position (and the @S position) should lead to down 1|pg||
nt|flash: Board 9, which was the beatable 5@C in here, was played in 4@H (!!!) in the Open Room|pg||
nt|flash: declarer got home with 11 tricks for another 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|warrens:  perfect auction, W got to show a good hand with 5+@D's and 4@S|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: Tihane have hearts control and @C to ruff but p dead|pg||
pc|hT|nt|haans: makes bidding easier|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mcphee: only 5 cards|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|haans: need to ruff a spade|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mcphee: my style is not to even bid micheals with the N hand as it is inbetween good and weak|pg||
nt|haans: one more dim|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT makes because spades break--without looking at all four hands 2@D doubled was a good idea |pg||
pc|s4|nt|aldek: On 8 Kalita Kotorowicz missed a diamond slam, but still won 16 IMP's|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mcphee: poor N is going to be endplayed in @S at some point|pg||
nt|cicus: although I don't like the 5-card M 1NT idea, I must admit it generally works |pg||
nt|flash: Jansma has to play another @D here|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|warrens:  it's possible to make 4@S here with 10 facing 9|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|warrens:  but he would have to be very careful (play a club to the dummy, then a low spade)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: well get a hearts|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|MolvaM: the defence must be careful tho. the difference between -3 and -4 is sooo great at pairs|pg||

pc|s9|nt|ralfwil: sry must leave you now! thanks all and see you later:)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mcphee: well they had a 650 so must beat it 4|pg||

nt|MolvaM: yes, the president just destroyed the opps|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: few min break until next round|pg||
nt|mcphee: so an excellent scoring round for e/w with only the first hand in question|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now we know that the bridge club is in good hands|pg||
nt|eleni: well we are now half way:):) Please take a deep breath and cross your fingers for the girls to win:)|pg||

nt|mcphee: card fees paid|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thats a bold bid|pg||
mb|2C|nt|haans: yep any contract that makes is best :)|pg||
nt|cicus: or maybe Polish club|pg||
mb|2S|nt|flash: the 3@D opening bid in the Open Room pushed West (much) too high...   |pg||
mb|2N|an| |nt|warrens:  2N here probably a 2-way bid or a transfer to 3@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes it's competitive and less good than 3@c directly|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: 2@C is not polish clubs |pg||
nt|flash: (for newcomers to BBO Vugraph, move your cursor over the Open Room result on this screen to see the auction)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|MolvaM: on vugraph its always attractive to bid like that|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt a make this time |pg||
nt|aldek: 3NT makes, but not easy to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 1@H would have been|pg||
nt|cicus: not here|pg||
nt|haans: holy|pg||
nt|cicus: but OR rebid 1@H after the same start|pg||
nt|flash: for those watching on BBO TV, i think you have to go through 'Other Table Results' or some such|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: @C 3-3|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mcphee: good lead but they will not be able to prevent the @S ruff on the table without the loss of a trump trick|pg||
nt|cicus: hand getting out of control|pg||
nt|haans: Big Clubs at its worse|pg||
nt|haans: lead to talk about|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: no breakes|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: this appears to be self-inflicted   :(|pg||
nt|warrens:  some players use 2NT here to distinguish between a good raise to 3@C and a weak one.  also, allows other non-forcing bids at the 3-level|pg||
pc|cK|nt|flash: a @H shift (and the @C re-entry) will keep down 3 in the picture|pg||
pc|c7|nt|MolvaM: NS can drop a few tricks on defence and still get a top|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rnmalik: could he not bid 3@H, choice of contract to the Partner|pg||
pc|cA|pg||

nt|rnmalik: yes|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|cicus: you can play big club combined with canapé style so that you can bid 1@H with the N  hand|pg||
nt|warrens:  hard to bid @H's after S has bid the suit (1@D showed @h's)|pg||
mc|9|nt|rnmalik: He has denied 5/5 by bidding 1@S and now 3@H would show 5@S+ 4@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|mcphee: good 3N for n/s|pg||
nt|cicus: no traps here, an easy 4@S|pg||
mb|1C|nt|MolvaM: EW have a double fit. lets see how high the will go this time|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Flat boards - no hope for the traling team|pg||
nt|warrens:  or maybe it would show one last game try with a very good hand? |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: bidding to 4@S in OR not standard|pg||
nt|flash: Verhees very active, again, in the Open Room|pg||
nt|flash: 2@S should be @Ss and a minor, less than an opening bid?|pg||
mb|1S|an|!d|nt|MolvaM: dbl?|pg||
nt|haans: looks like a pen double :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: this session started out with a lot of big swings both directions, but then it got much duller  :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: probably 2@h - 3@c...and then?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|haans: he can only ruff his own spade trick|pg||
nt|haans: xx is still not game|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: E should dblle and west can jump around in @S|pg||
nt|MolvaM: until 4s at least|pg||
nt|mcphee: why he is going so slow this time is a mystery|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphzgs: 2 off?|pg||
nt|flash: North's action marginal, but understandable|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: he learns quickly|pg||
nt|mcphee: this time he has a 4@S bid:)|pg||
nt|haans: sorry 6 spades|pg||
nt|cicus: but it was sensible|pg||
nt|flash: far from clear whose deal it was and 5@H could have been right|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@s from S|pg||
mb|3S|an| |mb|p|nt|MolvaM: on a good day 4s might even make|pg||
mb|3N|nt|haans: nice|pg||
nt|chick: somehow they managed to miss their nice heart fit|pg||
nt|flash: looks as though 1 trick in each suit available|pg||
nt|flash: again, Paulissen's @D2 should have suit preference implications|pg||
nt|flash: one of the issues that seems to have emerged, with these 2-suited opening bids, is that they're used with a very wide range of strengths|pg||
nt|flash: this one, for instance, is a relative monster not vulnerable|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: non vs vul a lot of pairs play it as 0-10|pg||
nt|flash: here, Jansma has to believe that East holds virtually these exact cards, if they're to beat this 2|pg||
nt|flash: given the @D2, Jan might cringe when he shifts to the @CK|pg||
nt|flash: Open Room has finished the set|pg||
nt|flash: since we got a late start, we'd assume that play will resume quite soon after the end of this set|pg||
nt|flash: if the other tables finish, this table might well not play the remaining boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: checkback in action again|pg||
nt|haans: but found godd nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: 4s now surely|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: down if S play small to @C9|pg||
nt|othered1: I open 1N off-shape almost never, and absolutely never with M2-2.|pg||
nt|yuval10: wow...|pg||

pc|d3|nt|rnmalik: yes was about to comment:)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|MolvaM: oh well almost :)|pg||
nt|flash: they'll still get both their tricks - only one pitch available on the @SK|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mcphee: W has not reverted to a different flight of fancy:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: now reverted|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think S sould've bided 4@c|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|warrens:  did S know that N had such a good hand?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|haans: 8 tricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: because N can't know after 1@s how strong the 2@h is, if it's only 16 or more|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h4|pc|d4|pg||
nt|cicus: going for the ruff, not risking @D finesse|pg||
nt|cicus: hard to find a promising lead from the E hand|pg||
nt|haans: do they have a claiming talk?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: no, E just thinking|pg||
nt|yuval10: N did bid 3@c first|pg||
mc|12|nt|mcphee: more @S looked like a better defence|pg||

nt|mcphee: @S slam going down 1?|pg||
nt|cicus: oh sorry I missed that, then a @D return from east spoils the squeeze|pg||
nt|chick: two more boards for today|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: yes, and again, today we broadcasted all of the A league teams|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: tomorrow we'll have three sessions with the leaders|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: starting at 9.30 (UTC+2)|pg||
nt|chick: I thought he might play @D hoping to find a spade endplay|pg||
nt|haans: North must have 2 spades|pg||
nt|haans: why did he play the Q|pg||
nt|flash: 8 more IMPs it is|pg||
nt|flash: next-to-last board of the set|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: we expect some frisky interference |pg||
nt|mcphee: oh maybe not over 2@S|pg||
mb|1C|an| |nt|mcphee: wow, 3@H i want to try suicide again :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: west recovered from his guilt :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: @hA lead could be costly|pg||
nt|mcphee: west goes bonkers only every other board:)|pg||
nt|cicus: apparently, it did not happen|pg||
nt|haans: Riinu been a pleasure  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: thx, but two more boards to go still :)|pg||
nt|haans: sure|pg||
nt|flash: not the most exciting series of boards we've had the hand generator produce, but some very solid results for the Netherlands pairs|pg||
nt|warrens:  anyway, a good chance for the Dutch to catch up some imps on that hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo you are absolutely right|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@s is pattern bid|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|an| |nt|haans: play of the cards for overtricks not for IMPs|pg||
nt|yuval10: not sure if it gives any indication about strength|pg||
nt|warrens:  For the spectators: these things are always easy to see from here, but harder at the table|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rnmalik: no denying we have the advantage of seeing all 52 cards.|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, if you were 3415 and had 16-17, why wouldn't you just bid 3N over 3@C and discourage partner?|pg||
nt|yuval10: because sometimes P has 5 small @d's or JXXXX and you want him to judge his hand better|pg||
nt|yuval10: sometimes 5@c makes and 3NT down|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mcphee: dopi, dble with zero I expcet|pg||
nt|MolvaM: are they on the same wavelength regarding the number of keycards?|pg||
nt|chick: S barely has an opening hand, so will not push, but N might|pg||
nt|haans: kib agree: Sundiszno: nortIf north had @sQxx, he'd have another card left to discard instead of the last spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: N should go|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mcphee: just not the right day for it|pg||
nt|MolvaM: initially north was hoping for a grand|pg||
nt|cicus: as I am told declarer could have ruffed a heart high|pg||
nt|haans: DOPI or DOPE|pg||
nt|chick: this will be a very hard decision for N when it comes around to him|pg||
nt|flash: again, the Dutch pre-empt 1 level higher than the Poles|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Israel has picked up only five swings, but most have been large to very large.|pg||
nt|warrens:  makes slam on a non spade lead, regardless of location of the club K|pg||
nt|warrens:  pitch 2 @S's on clubs|pg||
mb|4S|nt|haans: gross missunderstanding|pg||
nt|chick: next 'suit' up shows 2 keycards|pg||
nt|chick: although I prefer DEPO above 5 of our suit|pg||
nt|haans: or D = ODD P = EVEN|pg||
nt|chick: on previous hand, a sometime partner of Tihane tells me Tihane showed balanced hand with @c stopper when bidding 1@s, with Tihane, 1@s and 1nt responses to 1@c are reversed; but ...|pg||
nt|chick: the dbl could have confused Dalberg here (probably thought that the system is off)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: other than @S lead, this hand 6@H can be made or @C finesse and ruffing finesse, interesting|pg||
nt|warrens:  4@S probably key card|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: ahh|pg||
nt|mcphee: and it seems his judgement will be rewarded |pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|othered1: Here 2N probably started a sequence to show no more than a competitive hand.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|warrens:  no, now I think it was a cue bid, since if key card 5@D would show 2 plus the Q|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on ruffing @C finesse can pitch @S|pg||
mb|6H|nt|vugraphzgn: yes, that was it|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: but it wasn't for Tihane|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: so difficult not to lead it after pd's 5@h bid|pg||
nt|cicus: lead does not matter here as 2 clubs to lose anyway|pg||
nt|chick: or DOPE as you prefer :)|pg||
nt|chick: I thought maybe it said choose a minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: couldhave been, but then he would have passed 3@C|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, doesn't even need to ruff it, just give up a club and claim.  S could double for a spade lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: unusual suit combination in clubs where low the Jack is right not the K first|pg||
nt|warrens:  no, he missed his chance|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mcphee: that is true|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
nt|haans: we in Sweden did learn about DOPI 1971 when i was just a beginner|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mcphee: E could have bid 5@C maybe|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzge: smal break|pg||
nt|MolvaM: even @d suit 4-3 would be sufficient to make it against a club lead I guess|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so a very cruel distribution|pg||
nt|mcphee: at last Mom arrives |pg||
nt|mcphee: 2 tops for n/w and one score where pairs might fail in 4@H brought home bye good play from S|pg||
nt|mcphee: surely this will give n/s a little boost in morale|pg||
nt|mcphee: they have played reasonably well thus far|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d7|nt|haans: has gone round the world|pg||
nt|chick: DOPI  is really  D0P1  still in use at lower levels|pg||

pc|hT|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|cicus: @D can always be discarded on @HK|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|mcphee: 1-2 4@H in expect|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Many thanks to our excellent operator, Riiun Ots!   Great job, Riinu!|pg||

nt|chick: Aitäh kõigile meie jälgijatele. Meeldivate homme uuesti!|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|mcphee: now if they use ingberman S will bid 2N the start of weakness|pg||
nt|garnetts: 6@D is a spread but how easy will it be to bid I wonder|pg||
nt|garnetts: Might have been harder if West had started with 2@H |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgn: yes last one|pg||
nt|haans: at best|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 3 boards have been curtailed?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chrisky: efkoles 4@H apo n/s|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cicus: thanks Riinu for doing a nice job|pg||
nt|flash: well-judged by Jansma - West, in the Open Room, bid 3@S in the same auction|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|mcphee: usually F 3@C but here N will break the relay and should bid 3@D|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@C is an odd choice too---4@H   makes it tougher |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|cicus: and thanks for specs for your interest|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|mcphee: or 3N as he elected |pg||
nt|mcphee: with that short @C honor I would have tried 3@D|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|chick: the defense should be able to get 4 spades, 2 clubs, and the @DA for -1|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chick: S should at least consider passing 2N.  non-vul and 4-suit misfit means hard to set up a long suit for tricks|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mcphee: now up to N to try and steal the @D trick|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|haans: not transferring to spade with unbalanced hand?|pg||
nt|aldek: after 5@D couldn't check aces |pg||
pc|d2|nt|chick: I have been corrected :)|pg||
nt|chick: Aitäh kõigile meie jälgijatele. Meeldivate kohtumisteni homme uuesti!|pg||
nt|haans: but it is not common to due nowday 2nt is no game|pg||
nt|chick: understand|pg||
nt|garnetts: WE can consider who is to balme for missing the slam--one choice would be North  maybe 4@S showing a control and great support would easily get there|pg||
nt|garnetts: blame no balme |pg||
pc|d8|nt|mcphee: not that it will work in his favor mind you|pg||
nt|eleni: still a sound contract|pg||
nt|MolvaM: it seems NS play quite a system with all the artificial bids and transfers. so surprising to have seen them miss a simple major fit on hand  6|pg||
nt|mcphee: he needs to lead @D twice from hand for this plow to have any chance|pg||
nt|cicus: good result here for Rakvere, a double part score|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chick: non-vul, the risk of not bidding game is much smaller|pg||
nt|othered1: I think this is the last hand of this set.  Thanks much to our operator for the fine presentation.  Thanks to Cornelia and Ralf for their comments. |pg||

nt|MolvaM: east has a maximum pass so he must be happy too|pg||
nt|MolvaM: how?|pg||
nt|garnetts: well it strikes me that on the last hand 4@S must agree diamonds since North neither opened with a pre-empt not bid spade when it was his first turn |pg||

nt|haans: @D 3-3 against|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|mcphee: and 3N will make, if he does|pg||
nt|garnetts: This raises technichal agreements here--I would play pass and bid after the redouble as strong--reserving an initial 2@S as a weaker hand|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|haans: bidding today Open with less than opening and continue|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mcphee: normal tendancy is to go after @D|pg||
nt|haans: sound like more than 40 hcp in the deck|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|garnetts: Interesting too that the redouble expresses values from East--clearly thinks it releeases him from bidding again after a green third seat opening |pg||

nt|aldek: Paulissen has misplayed the hand slightly|pg||
nt|garnetts: spade lead and eventually a club switch when in with the A@H  second round duck and curtains |pg||

mb|1H|nt|haans: 9th trick in clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|garnetts: Grand looks gerat seeing EW hands only but the 4-0 trump break seems to have beaten it especially when there is also a stiff heart|pg||
