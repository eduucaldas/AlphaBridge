nt|Gerben42: 1nt with 5@H is usually a good idea|pg||
nt|mcphee: good hand here for 4 suit tranfers|pg||
nt|mcphee: the N player can show @C and then indicate shortness to arrive at the best game|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: This first session (10 boards) is between the teams Veloni-Virvidakis. They both were 5th in their groups|pg||

nt|haans: different opinions But who is right? one deal do not give the answer|pg||
nt|haans: 1000 deals do not give ...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Part of the answer is, that playing NT our judgment is very good, perhaps not for a suit-contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: apparently they do not have 4 suit transfers available|pg||
nt|lelos: twra mallon 6@d|pg||

nt|petrosa: 3NT in the open room|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Gerben42: all roads lead to 3NT,|pg||

pc|c2|nt|haans: @SJ hard to play |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|sT|nt|eleni: And yes, it is a pairs tourney|pg||
nt|Gerben42: looks like +1, thus beating 5@C|pg||

nt|cicus: I am surprised at seeing no 3@C preempt from west|pg||
mb|1N|nt|MolvaM: I would prefer a 1NT overcall from north here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: with only 2@H, dbl is ok I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: stop at 2@S?|pg||
mb|2C|an|*|nt|eleni: The Ladies Mrs.Panagaki and Mrs.Syrakopoulou may lose their @h fit:(|pg||

mb|p|nt|cicus: yes|pg||

mb|2H|an|*|nt|Gerben42: now will play 3@C|pg||
nt|zoh:  2@s?|pg||
nt|mcphee: well 1NT is a choice but with only 2@H dble is much more comfortable|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the problem is, now south will overrate his 7 hcp. |pg||
nt|eleni: on BBO, North is ddiony and South nickd, West is vasso, East doest play on BBO:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Results at the moment are: Levi 88 - Hliapas 91 and Zeis 92.|pg||
nt|haans: support double = show 3 spades|pg||
nt|cicus: coming back with 2@C seems rather purposeless to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|petrosa: -1  with logical play|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bmkl: 2nd half of the Greek Open teams semifinal|pg||
mb|p|nt|ghionis: 1st swing here i think|pg||
nt|haans: NS not happy|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 1@D = weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: i like this 2@S choice from S|pg||
nt|mcphee: it could easily outscore a minor partial, |pg||
nt|zoh:  duck the King|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Gerben42: must make since 2@H does not|pg||
nt|eleni: Lucas' name on BBO is zentel|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, this game is rather thin|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H may have been 4 @H|pg||
nt|haans: 4 hearts|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: So I have the shiny lady Eline who is 5 years older than me. 17Y 408M. There u are specs:)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|cicus: in fact I would have bid an immediate 2@H instead of 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: yes, 1H was 4 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: but 2C was 5 clubs|pg||
pc|d9|nt|eleni: lucky hand for N-S, in the Open Room they made it|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mcphee: although I am not fond of reasponding a 3 card suit in these positions|pg||
nt|haans: not Big Clubs at its best|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eleni: nice bid from George Loussis|pg||
nt|zlatan: accident...|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|zoh:  Tora atoy|pg||

nt|bmkl: Sapounakis -team from Athens- is leading Levi -team from Thessaloniki -|pg||
nt|zlatan: and 6@h is a good contract as the cards lie :)|pg||
nt|cicus: can't see this making|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|eleni: yes Frank, and I play at least 5 more years than you are:):) as I play since I was 9 years old:)|pg||
nt|eleni: right:)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|lelos: trying to give @h count cost a trick|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||

nt|eleni: yes:) nice end play|pg||
nt|bmkl: Manolas will make it if he guesses @cs right|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Perhaps, but most systems would end up in 4 @S,  having chances|pg||
pc|c8|nt|haans: do not like that wjs |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|piret0: chamionship is held during three weekends; 3 x round robin of 8 teams in A-league|pg||
nt|flash: hi, all     not a pleasant declarer-play problem for Jansma|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chick: I think the problem here was more that 1@H didn't show 5, then N could pass more comfortably|pg||
pc|c6|nt|piret0: this is the last, final week |pg||
pc|h5|nt|zoh:  3@s eykola|pg||

nt|zoh:  Q@C|pg||
nt|Gerben42: how many boards per round?|pg||
nt|mcphee: i suppose if the S hand wanted to be a bit wild they could dble 2@H responsive|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: 3 board per round, 8 rounds 24 boards|pg||
nt|mcphee: but that action seems very risky|pg||
pc|c2|nt|piret0: updated results will be posted on home page after each round |pg||

nt|eleni: 16 teams play in this round robin and just 8 of them will be forwarded to the last round|pg||
nt|eleni: Yet he plays against experienced players:) George Roussos and Manos Hatzidakis (mathat on BBO)|pg||
nt|haans: slamming now????????????????????|pg||
nt|haans: the less the less often|pg||
pc|hA|nt|zlatan: n guess :)|pg||
nt|haans: south to have opps honors so no slam|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Better write a book about WJS - this is board 3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Gerben42: 2@C is a tricky bid, now S will think his hand is worse than it is|pg||
nt|Gerben42: playing 2/1 I guess 1NT followed by 4@S is better|pg||
nt|mcphee: well that could lead to a missed slam|pg||
nt|zoh:  To 2@s einai forcing game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well 3@s is promising|pg||
nt|eleni: so far so good up to now:) good players play the correct contracts in both tables:)|pg||
nt|lelos: hard to find @d lead also|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: stop at5 4@S|pg||
nt|chick: the main reason hearts play better is the bad spade split ... EW cannot discover that in the auction|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|eleni: a most aggressive bid:) at the other table, E-W are simply at 2NT|pg||
nt|eleni: the lead was also a @h|pg||
nt|eleni: John is thinking very long and he is right|pg||
nt|droopy17: gia 1 kato|pg||
nt|eleni: On the final contest 4 teams will plau on knock outs for qualification of 1/2/3/4 places|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Tasos:) and welcome|pg||
nt|bmkl: easy game despite duplicate values in @cs|pg||
nt|ghionis: nikos (a very friendly person) always enjoy the game as he does the same with his life|pg||
nt|eleni: unless if we have a surprise:)|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|flash: coach Anton Maas usually tries to have the pairs play against different opponents and in different team combinations throughout|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mcphee: frankly i see not reason for S to not bid 3@H ater 2@S|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C will lead to missed slam more often opposite @C shortness|pg||
nt|zoh:  Logika i antam einai @d|pg||
pc|h8|nt|eleni: same contract in the open room:)|pg||
nt|ghionis: he has never read at least one bridge book but he is excellant card player (and poker too)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cicus: there is chance to make this|pg||
nt|haans: assume 4@D was kcb|pg||
nt|hawe45:  North will feel bad, when he sees dumnmy|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|eleni: a pretty dubious contract:)|pg||
nt|lelos: logiko to gurisma afou o karlaftis eipe 3@h|pg||
nt|rodal f: Homeit runned for a push|pg||
nt|lelos: Hi Frank :)|pg||
nt|eleni: Same contract in the open room|pg||
nt|petrosa: I would open the N hand: 2NT|pg||
nt|haans: and what did 4@D really mean?|pg||
nt|haans: clibs honor + @HK at south can not be a suprise|pg||
nt|haans: unlucky hearts|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hawe45:  To please psrtner, South should overtake and plan @D Queen...|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mcphee: can actually manage 11 tricks here for a decent score|pg||
nt|mcphee: best is to take @D finesse asap|pg||
nt|MolvaM: might make 12 tricks if he finesses @d|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes |pg||
nt|zoh:  Mono i @h einai kalo gyrisma|pg||
nt|eleni: Those teams are Nos 1 & 2 up to now (in the first 3 rounds) No 1 is Altinis Team, while Sapounakis team is 2nd|pg||
nt|chick: he won't feel bad for too long, there is simply no place for the losing diamond to go|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Gerben42: how do you get 12|pg||
nt|cicus: at first sight N can be squeezed but he discards after dummy|pg||
nt|chick: unless ....  W leads the @D10 and N covers|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mcphee: the @D finesse is clearly best choice|pg||
nt|lelos: paizei ton zozi gia K@c kai A@s|pg||
nt|haans: if 3@C did show minimum East had no cards for slam|pg||
nt|flash: i'm not as familiar with the goings on with Polish team, so if anyone has any inside information, by all means, let me know  :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|eleni: Please be with us, tomorrow at 17:00 CET and Sunday 9:30CET|pg||
pc|dT|nt|MolvaM: @d finesse is not extremely risky as he can discard his @h loser even if @d finesse loses|pg||
nt|eleni: yes zoh, a @h return would have been killing|pg||
nt|Gerben42: no entries for @C@D squeeze|pg||
nt|mcphee: @h yes a better defence, but with right view nothing matters|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he needs friendly breaks in all suits though|pg||
nt|mcphee: @D hook cash A, @H to hand and ruff @D loser|pg||
nt|mcphee: draw trumps and claim|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Gerben42: then you still lose a @H for 11|pg||
nt|eleni: with the 10@d return, he has chances|pg||
nt|lelos: +K@d fusika|pg||
nt|chick: E will have to stop now and try to trump some clubs|pg||
nt|haans: why cover the 10|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - the @D-suit by far too weak|pg||
nt|chick: I didn't say he should, only that it's the only possible hope for W|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Was just ONLY chance for making the contract|pg||
nt|haans: agree there|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s why S should overtake and play @D Queen|pg||
nt|chick: when you are outmanned, outgunned, and out of ideas, there is just one remaining hope ..... guile|pg||

nt|Gerben42: Q: what is the point of doubling 5@C when you already raised|pg||
nt|petrosa: where are the diamonds?|pg||
nt|eleni: quite a friendly lead from Fotis:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Fotis should find the 4@s now|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: sorry about the mistake |pg||
nt|haans: but ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: I know many north players who wouldnt bid anything |pg||
nt|liarakos: hmm|pg||
nt|lelos: something wrong with bidding proly|pg||
nt|petrosa: it is difficult to find 7-2 fit nowdays|pg||
mb|3N|nt|eleni: yuck|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H was not the best way to slam|pg||
nt|haans: np|pg||
nt|chick: what is the aggressive lead against a slam guideline?     lead away from the closest thing you have to a trick |pg||
mb|p|nt|liarakos: i think 3@H is too much space consuming|pg||
nt|eleni: no girls at this table, and as you know @d are girls best friends|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: a nice play would have been the 10@c and a small @s to the 10|pg||
nt|rodal f: How to handlethe @D color by 3 missing? Here u are a nice site by %: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm|pg||
nt|haans: best way to get 2 :)|pg||
nt|chick: if I knew partner had both black suits, I would lead a club in preference to a spade|pg||
nt|chick: it does seem their system is getting them too high,  usually think of big club systems as keeping you low when responder is weakish|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: i pass the N hand myself but understnad the need to bid|pg||
nt|bmkl: they didn't missed this one|pg||
nt|eleni: true, while at the other table Yiangos got a bit chicken|pg||
nt|cicus: E had two chances to bid the suit but failed to find them|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|chick: all moot now, S is signing off in 5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petrosa: so more imps for Thessaloniki|pg||
nt|chick: well, good auction anyway, they found the right spot|pg||
nt|flash: again, many options...   |pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: including @d7 :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: cue in clubs then all easy|pg||
nt|haans: not far fetch|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lelos: my guess is +2|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|petrosa: N must bid more, with so many@D|pg||
nt|rodal f: And S followed the book.|pg||
nt|flash: :)     perhaps the most straightforward would be to play on @Cs|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|c7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|flash: on the lie of the cards, declarer could have afforded to win the first @H, but this is definitely safer|pg||
nt|flash: the alternative would be to play on @Ds; as we can see, that also works|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: clubs safer after the discard?|pg||
nt|flash: however, the entry situation looks to get quite tangled, if declarer goes after @Ds|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petrosa: he didn't describe his hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cicus: over 3@H he was probably obliged to bid his stopper|pg||
pc|s3|nt|MolvaM: not much to play for here|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chick: although can't argue with success, they *are* in the lead :)|pg||
nt|haans: strong point :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|eleni: a difficult decision for Mrs. Papypari|pg||
pc|s2|nt|MolvaM: just claim and get it over with|pg||
nt|eleni: in spite of the helpful lead a 600 is a bad score in pairs|pg||
nt|mcphee: more to the piont is how can you not lead @C?|pg||
nt|eleni: Papyraki|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|petrosa: +8|pg||
pc|s4|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s8|nt|eleni: so the system worked in this case:)|pg||
nt|haans: nice|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In this board - a good rule/lesson. When declarer asks for the @D King, doÂ´nt even think about playing the Ace!|pg||
pc|s7|nt|MolvaM: they believed the 5@c bid|pg||
nt|ghionis: give trick back|pg||
nt|ghionis: he is very polite":)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|mcphee: well S gets all the blame for this hand, N contriubted just a little|pg||
nt|MolvaM: a simple 2@s reverse from south would be enough. but anyway|pg||
nt|cicus: from his point of view West could have held a long @D suit|pg||
nt|haans: thta 2@C prempt was effective|pg||
pc|cT|nt|droopy17: -2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|zlatan: difficultto find it after the 2@h opening|pg||

nt|petrosa: it was another flat board:)|pg||
nt|liarakos: 6@d at the open room|pg||
nt|ghionis: oh only the viewgrafer was:)|pg||
nt|haans: second slam try|pg||
nt|haans: with u (no joke 2)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Double-dumme many tricks N/S here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I mean, that a declarer playing his sington King - he has NOT 2 or 3 small in the suit. He DREAMS about finding an opponent, who will take the trick|pg||
nt|flash: given the @H lead (and the split of that suit), i'd think that the odds of South having KQx of @Cs are quite slim|pg||
mb|p|nt|petrosa: playing natural...|pg||
nt|haans: 6 minor|pg||
nt|flash: note that @Ds wouldn't have to be 3-3 for that suit to set up - Hx in either hand would suffice (declarer had all the spots)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: Give me that @h suit, and @cKQx and I'd definitely bid|pg||
mb|1H|nt|petrosa: they will find another slam|pg||
nt|eleni: bad board for E-W if they go up high|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: a very heavy pass from east|pg||
nt|Gerben42: healthy pass :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: perfectly sensible to pass E I think|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yep|pg||
nt|eleni: 4@s is a solid contract, losing 1@s+1@h+1@c|pg||
nt|droopy17: ne|pg||
nt|lelos: :)|pg||
nt|lelos: dificult not impossible|pg||
nt|lelos: 1nt or 2@s ?|pg||
nt|liarakos: North opened 1@S|pg||
nt|liarakos: it was easier|pg||
nt|eleni: 3@d-1 were played in the open room|pg||
nt|rodal f: In my eyes a mad 1@D bid when EW ain't limiteded|pg||
nt|cicus: 6@D to be preferred|pg||

mb|1S|nt|eleni: after all they are vul|pg||
nt|haans: for sure|pg||
nt|cicus: although it is hard to guess in which suit the opponents can arrange a ruff|pg||

mb|p|nt|cicus: but you have more @Ds than @Cs|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mcphee: no majors|pg||
nt|lelos: 2! gazzili|pg||
nt|lelos: 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: 2@D some trick bid?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I guess 2@C shows a fit|pg||
nt|lelos: dionusopoulos is well trained :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW have 3@S= or +1 and 4@C=|pg||
nt|flash: :)   |pg||
nt|flash: most pairs will have a check-back sequence available here|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|haans: to overtrick NS at or 1 down is good|pg||
mb|p|nt|petrosa: 2@D=9+|pg||
nt|petrosa: 8+|pg||
nt|haans: and they have @DA and not @CA|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lelos: gia pekse|pg||
nt|rodal f: OK Tasos:))|pg||
nt|petrosa: 2@C is FG|pg||

nt|zlatan: just made :)|pg||
nt|cicus: I would not have predicted the 2NT rebid even if I had 5 guesses|pg||
nt|haans: normal to miss this slam|pg||
nt|cicus: you can get there using standard methods by opening 1@C then reversing into @Ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: S called the director|pg||
nt|haans: i agree 3nt should have been played by west|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: I'm on the other side of the screen though|pg||
nt|cicus: for what reason?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: sorry, can't tell|pg||

mb|p|nt|mcphee: now an attempt to catch up|pg||
nt|MolvaM: eleni said EW are sweet ladies, so they wont trick us :)|pg||
nt|haans: imps to NS|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mcphee: might make it if the D stays away from the @D suit|pg||
nt|zoh:  2NTkalo symbolaio|pg||
nt|eleni: beware of the sweet ladies:):)|pg||
nt|mcphee: may have been better to pop an honor card from table|pg||
nt|zoh:  :) Sosta Eleni|pg||
nt|jcone: good sacrifice in 5 hearts   not found by Christnitsa|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: they always know what they are doing:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Taso, by the end of this tournament, Frank will speak Greek:)|pg||
nt|lelos: 50 years ago this would be a passed out board i think|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ain't we happy that things have happen at the bridge:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Taso 50 years ago anyone would have opened 1@h with E's hand:):) dreadful but true|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will it end -1 or -2 by a @S ruff and miss the @D?|pg||
nt|lelos: i think down 2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Didn't the say min 13HP by that time Eleni? So 12HP ain't good enough|pg||
nt|eleni: ohhhhhhhhhhhhh Nickkkkkkkkkkkkkk pls play|pg||
nt|rodal f: The nick name was Nick?:)|pg||
nt|eleni: nickd|pg||
nt|eleni: and yes Frank 12 and a dbltn|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still it was 13HP. Later they conted doubbletons etc.|pg||
nt|eleni: remember pls our good old Goren:):)|pg||
nt|rodal f: But by that time not with a honor included. It came later.|pg||
nt|eleni: and then Albarran and his 5-cards majors and canape|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Director called by W for delay by S|pg||
nt|lelos: this is standard for N/S|pg||
nt|eleni: South, Nick is still thinking:)|pg||
nt|haans: @D right|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: 5 imps to the Dutch :)|pg||
nt|flash: 3@S was allowed to make on Board 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: S left the table to visit the toilet|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: or bathroom, whatever is better English :P|pg||
nt|flash: we'd think that North had a plan in mind when he continued with 3@C|pg||
nt|flash: but, having found that the partnership has two 8-card fits, he's apparently thinking of bidding more|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|MolvaM: I expect many players to open the east hand, then hard to stop before 3nt|pg||
nt|haans: @C right|pg||
nt|haans: @H right|pg||
nt|hawe45:  They get 200 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  But not with this shift|pg||
nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|flash: i'd think the 3 small @Hs and the lack of shortness would deter him, but...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: our E is hoping to win the J in hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|petrosa: after this lead he wii not make it|pg||
nt|flash: interesting (and unanticipated)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|petrosa: without dbl-Mr Karlaftis is afraid?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|rodal f: WD|pg||
nt|eleni: was worth the thinking?|pg||
nt|jcone: P misclicked?   now makes |pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mcphee: another good think about splitting the @S honors is N is more likely to return the suit if they win it\|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so making 2nt will be a good score I expect|pg||
nt|mcphee: N should find the @D shift now I think|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: hi tez|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi tez |pg||
nt|tez: hi Bob ve merhaba molvam:)|pg||
nt|liarakos: defense will have a chance later|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now it's just the ruff in @S left for EW|pg||
nt|flash: 11 tricks on the lead|pg||
pc|sK|nt|zoh:  Kai tora @d|pg||
nt|eleni: welcome Tez:):) we have been waiting for you:)|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, being 'on air' may add to the anxiety tremendously|pg||
pc|s6|nt|haans: nothing is easier than errors in defense|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: to get 9 needed deep @D finesse|pg||
nt|haans: lack of entries|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Duck|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s4|nt|eleni: Kalispera Taso|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Gerben42: now @D shift was in order, happy camping for EW now|pg||
nt|tez: :)|pg||
nt|haans: had been my choice|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another example - why not duck the @S King???|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|haans: bidding was not Big Clubs style|pg||
nt|haans: more Acol style|pg||
nt|flash: use it or lose it...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcphee: so N was sleeping and did not notice the small @C or S has the carding wrong:)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mcphee: now we have an over trick|pg||
nt|zoh:  Afoy den brethike i amyna pire poly kako score o B-N|pg||
nt|eleni: 2|pg||
nt|eleni: good girls:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: this means some of the 3NT bidders will make their contract too|pg||
nt|eleni: only on a similar play Murat:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would be delighted with 180 myself|pg||
nt|Gerben42: maybe ...|pg||
nt|MolvaM: difficult to play diamonds after east opens 1@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: 2min break|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@D is almost a psyche *g|pg||
nt|eleni: a 75% score for our Ladies here, one can say|pg||
nt|mcphee: well that is true, but on the @C play S shows not interest so what is left?|pg||
nt|eleni: you are so right Bob|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but eleni said they all play udca no?|pg||
nt|zoh:  Nai ta koritsia piran 2 poly kala score apo 2 poly kaloys paiktes|pg||
nt|eleni: yes Murat, they do|pg||
nt|mcphee: if they play usdca S carded wrong|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if udca, then south must have liked the @c shift. hence north continued the attack|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so north is innocent|pg||
nt|eleni: he might have false carded though, just to mic up the girls|pg||
nt|Gerben42: they were very mixed up|pg||
nt|mcphee: but, crafty E is so proud her 2@D bid worked out so well:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: At operating seat, John Manios, new addition to our vugraph team :)|pg||
nt|eleni: mix them up:) but girls never get mixed up:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: right, there are rumors that girls mix men up|pg||

nt|haans: i think 2nt did show extra|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6xx|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 2nT might be the key bid although I don't know its meaning|pg||
nt|chick: I think I would have led a small trump, under the theory that anything else would give away a trick|pg||
nt|haans: many would have lead the single :))|pg||
nt|haans: hard to make|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|petrosa: one down is good bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  OH - 5 @C - no make|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: the t/o dble was getting the e/w pair off to the right fit had E bid|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: they did it|pg||
nt|flash: North's X apparently shows 3-card spt|pg||
pc|h8|nt|flash: Board 4 turned into a 2-IMP gain for Netherlands!!  E-W reached 5@D in the Open Room|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Gerben42: @D is right? @S counts more|pg||
nt|tez: usually 2@s after an initial dbl is a stronger hand|pg||
nt|tez: with E i wld definitely bid 2@d over 1@s|pg||
nt|chick: good lead ... partner very unlikely to have an entry to lead hearts thru declarer|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wander if the X and X from N made S belive more HPs at N. Don't have there CC|pg||
nt|lelos: i think 1@d shows unbalanced hand hence the 1@c|pg||
nt|eleni: no CCs available today, I hope there will be for the final 4s|pg||
nt|lelos: all other natural|pg||
nt|rodal f: After input from some specs: It seems that S took to much vitamins before the last bid:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: W thinking and check CC of NS|pg||
pc|c6|nt|haans: more clubs|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|liarakos: no swing|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|jcone: 4 clubs doubled down  a few    Maria=Salvation Army|pg||
nt|eleni: They play behind screens, yet they have 90 minutes for the 10 boards of this session......... though they are pretty behind time|pg||
nt|haans: now a make ruff a clubs|pg||
nt|flash: this appears to depend on an inspired guess in @Ss|pg||
nt|flash: and should now go down 1|pg||
nt|flash: aha - some of you are more awake than i - unless the @DK is dropped, declarer will probably end down 2|pg||
nt|flash: we'd assume that Jansma is trying to decide whether he needs to lead a @D here|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|lelos: 9 easy tricks for a push|pg||
nt|chick: surprised they didn't have a good leadback signal for a spade|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lelos: @s is best now|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|cT|nt|cicus: could have tried a small club in case @Hs are not running|pg||
pc|c4|nt|droopy17: idio apotelesma|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petrosa: 2 maximum= -1|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|flash: now Paulissen has two ways to beat this 2...   this is one of them|pg||
nt|flash: either red suit works now |pg||
nt|flash: Paulissen has played J, then T in @Cs, so the layout of that suit should be clear (??)|pg||
nt|flash: Board 5 in as a push - the Open Room might well pass us|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mcphee: @S finesse was not best I do not think|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mcphee: but it worked|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petrosa: the problem is the quality of @D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Discarding @H 9 fx|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Dangerous - a show-up might tell, that North has the @D Queen|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

nt|eleni: no swing on 7 either|pg||
nt|harmon: ok now the action can start!!! Bobbo here|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|haans: overbid let them make it |pg||
nt|chick: everyone see how to do this?     ruff @D, another heart, heart, then trump coup|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d2|pc|s8|nt|cicus: but then a @D back would have spoiled commuications|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: so they changed the result of the 5th table - 11 tricks|pg||

nt|haans: :) still fine  bridge|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Other room - @H-lead and @D-finesse|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt by NORTH|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: (players discussing last board :))|pg||
mb|1D|nt|MolvaM: and west would know that diamonds are her best friend anyway|pg||
nt|eleni: Last board of this segment so see you in a few minutes|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt-3nt|pg||
nt|flash: the West hand is a problem for 'standard' bidders|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|eleni: As we all know Bobolakis and George Karlaftis both are teams' players. They rarely risk their contracts|pg||
nt|eleni: Last board of this Championship for this table|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H-3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: no no sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: N wants to bid more|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4@c is a good save|pg||
nt|mcphee: so is 3N:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: against 140|pg||
nt|tez: 3nt pls:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4@C bound to get dbled|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3N will not be|pg||
nt|eleni: 4@d would be a bad bid by Dimos|pg||
nt|tez: trust your partner:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt gets doubled faster|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but north would run probably|pg||
nt|chick: that will warn them off of 3N|pg||
nt|haans: best you can do is double|pg||
nt|flash: Jansma starts with 1@D in order to have a rebid should partner respond 1@S or 1NT|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cicus: many play that 1@D - 2@C denies a major|pg||
nt|cicus: hence the 1@H response|pg||
nt|flash: Jansma will discourage a @D continuation (?)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bmkl: no risk no return Eleni :)|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt not easy with @D lead |pg||
nt|haans: not that farfetched|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mcphee: you would be surprised if N dbled here and S bids 3N how often they save in 4@S|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|mcphee: S might have stepped in with 2@H here|pg||
nt|petrosa: another -1|pg||
nt|petrosa: bad luck|pg||
nt|liarakos: i am not sure|pg||
nt|eleni: Last board of this Segment:) In about 15 minutes we'll watch the final and most interesting ending of this championship:)|pg||
nt|flash: note the lead of the K - an attempt to hold the lead and let partner tell you what to do next|pg||
nt|flash: so West's cards should be suit preference, with a middle card suggesting a continuation of @Ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: they seem to play low disc, as paulissen already held the @h4|pg||
nt|flash: we'll see if the partnership is on the same wave length|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mcphee: a little soft, but what the hect|pg||
nt|cicus: has to decide if @Hs are 4-4 or @S finesse is on|pg||
nt|haans: but spade finesse|pg||
nt|cicus: @Ds, I mean|pg||
nt|cicus: 4-4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No 2-@D bid to me - very bad, IÂ´m sorry. Could stop opponents from bidding an unmakeable 3 NT, can cost 300 against nothing etc.|pg||
nt|haans: really open 1nt in better Never be inlove with majors|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|harmon: If declarer plays a high club from his hand south shd drop Q|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|petrosa: Q@h|pg||
nt|petrosa: and many -|pg||
nt|liarakos: maybe x @H and many down|pg||
nt|cicus: if @D5 led, it strongly suggests a 5-card suit|pg||
nt|haans: playing will take time|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK, then 2 @D worked good - the lead|pg||
nt|chick: 3N bid at the other table, but made without a diamond lead|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|eleni: George you are right, Nick Perdikaris is an aggressive player:)|pg||
nt|ghionis: :)|pg||
nt|eleni: but in this case he decided to use the law of total tricks|pg||
nt|eleni: and it will work|pg||
pc|h7|nt|cicus: because of rule of 11|pg||
nt|haans: @D4 = five cards|pg||
nt|flash: good shift|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|MolvaM: yes we are surprised :)|pg||
nt|eleni: true, this is why on board 16 they lost an IMP|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tez: 1 down|pg||
nt|mcphee: things lay well for declarer|pg||
nt|liarakos: 5@H x in the open|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|eleni: a wild bidding:)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|liarakos: -2 probably so 11 imps to Levi|pg||
nt|cicus: on the run of @Cs S will have to find discards, however|pg||
nt|haans: specially attention to J and 10|pg||
nt|chick: being doubled does have that effect :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mcphee: W overstepped hi bounds with this 4@S bid|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hawe45:  Yes - but here that danger didÂ´nt exist - S had bid NT allready|pg||
nt|haans: withour @D bid from W|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|mcphee: good point, but as @D run nothing helps|pg||
nt|eleni: 3dx=|pg||
nt|harmon: true I just pointed it out cause Stevo did that to me to beat me, I almost got it right cause it was Stevo|pg||
mc|8|nt|eleni: not this board:):) that was for the operator of the other table:):) board 5@h|pg||
nt|eleni: in the open room E-W on this one scored +1 for 450|pg||
nt|flash: Jansma couldn't be sure that the @D was cashing, so he shifted|pg||

mb|p|nt|liarakos: only 3N here|pg||
nt|flash: 5 and 6 in as pushes...   on 6, the Open Room played 4@S - this room ended, a bit strangely, in 4NT|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|mcphee: 1@C?|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  hello|pg||
nt|rodal f: a 10IMPer out the window when NS got there chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: polish?|pg||
nt|eleni: @h@h we must point out that the young lady in South, Christine Syrakopoulou, is an excellent player|pg||
nt|lelos: 2@s intermidiate|pg||
nt|petrosa: the bidding system of levi-stavrinos is not perfect|pg||
nt|petrosa: they play 3NT|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|mcphee: they are Greeks:)|pg||

nt|cicus: yes, denying points :)|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|harmon: how young|pg||
nt|petrosa: in 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: hard to believe N would balance 3@C atht eh other table|pg||
nt|mcphee: here N was more tuned in that e/w may not fit so well|pg||
nt|jcone: Edgar   is 30   young enough?|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: Im an old goat just checking|pg||
nt|eleni: a little older than Christine:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: quite the lead|pg||
nt|petrosa: they didn't find the double fit, nor the slam|pg||
nt|flash: if 1@D showed @Hs (as seems likely), South's X probably shows 3-card spt|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzge: paizoume twra thn 39, meta thn 38 :)|pg||
nt|cicus: bd6 suggested EW were playing natural system but now it seems I was wrong and it's a strong club|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|petrosa: afterall they have only 30hcp|pg||
nt|eleni: At the other table, on board 19, Judy Levi plays 3NT, so yes, some IMPs for Chliapas|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S = weak 4@S = firm|pg||
nt|chick: Multumiri, Riinu :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|mcphee: poor W now has a problem|pg||
nt|mcphee: no cost as it happens|pg||
nt|eleni: a good save in 6@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: he should have just overcalled 1@S and be done with it|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: suspicious dbl by west with singleton @h|pg||
nt|eleni: oh ok:) As Effie told us, they picked up board 39, before 38:)|pg||
nt|flash: Ace and a @H to beat this?|pg||
nt|flash: if, indeed, North has shown @H length and South 3-card spt, Jansma will find it|pg||
nt|flash: if, instead, the meaning of the bids is different, there's no particular reason to lead the suit|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|mcphee: yes, it was lucky N bid|pg||
nt|polyvlakas: this should be an easy board....with a diffirent bidding|pg||

nt|vugraphzgn: sorry that there was 3S for a while, it's 5|pg||
pc|s8|nt|eleni: yes, but I can not guess what E-W would have done, had Karlaftis bid 6@d|pg||
nt|haans: Trommel do not understand that play|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cicus: oh, I see, you were joking with us :)|pg||
nt|cicus: is this real?|pg||
nt|cicus: west ducked @S10?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: I'm sorry I lost this game|pg||
nt|cicus: no problem|pg||
nt|haans: not really|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|eleni: let's hope Maria Panagaki won't return a @c|pg||
nt|cicus: normal result|pg||
pc|cQ|mc|11|nt|MolvaM: defence dropped a few tricks here|pg||
nt|mcphee: W refused to lead a @S and now it will cost him big time|pg||
nt|bmkl: they are vulnerable|pg||
nt|eleni: exactly but I suppose this will be a swing|pg||
nt|chick: maybe trying to unblock for his partner?   but it certainly went wrong this time|pg||
nt|flash: on Board 7, 3@S was other-sided in the Open Room and came home - 8 more IMPs to Netherlands|pg||

nt|cicus: ah they have the methods here as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: provided they want to Tez:):)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@c must include 19-20 NT|pg||
nt|tez: 2@c 18 19 bal or..|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@H is puzzling *g|pg||
nt|harmon: shd get to 5h|pg||
mb|2D|nt|MolvaM: or south is overbidding :)|pg||
nt|petrosa: in 19 4@H Dbl|pg||
nt|lelos: very good slam|pg||
nt|polyvlakas: without the 2 queens, it would be a normal vurnerable weak2|pg||
nt|haans: or not :)|pg||
nt|cicus: 5@C is only down on the unlikely @D lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: ah - transfer|pg||
nt|rodal f: Been nice to meet u. See u tomorrow at 17.00CET|pg||
nt|eleni: right Thanasi, 6 are there all the time, so let us see if Fotis and Aris will get there|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  the strong hand finds out 5-5-2-1 in West and there is a play even with 0 points|pg||
nt|haans: good cards in spade|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mcphee: yee old mexican 2@D|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the inventor of transfer bids must be rich with all the copyright money he gets|pg||
nt|jcone: 2 @C  game force|pg||
nt|mcphee: must be some form of gazilli|pg||
nt|petrosa: in the open room|pg||
nt|lelos: hmm|pg||
nt|rodal f: Pass and 10 tricks on RD|pg||
nt|haans: sure|pg||
nt|flash: we've confirmed that 1@D on the last hand was an xfer to @Hs; given Jansma's lead, we'd assume that South's X showed values, not necessarily 3-card @H spt|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 6@C seems nice|pg||
nt|lelos: not even in 3:)|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  difficult to get there with natural system|pg||
nt|hawe45:  On a good day - playing @S to one looser - we get 110|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 6@c is perfect|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 3@D must show @C then?!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6nt is more exciting|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I'm right - getting the hang of this|pg||
nt|harmon: Im told NS play the nunes/fantoni system|pg||
nt|petrosa: not 3NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcone: the Double should put brakes on|pg||
nt|petrosa: it is easier if you know 52 cards|pg||
nt|liarakos: -1 so 19-9 to Capa final|pg||
pc|c8|nt|MolvaM: we want slams that make on a finesse, squeeze, throw-in etc|pg||
nt|mcphee: wow, 4@H opposite a GF strikes me as a very poor bid|pg||
nt|harmon: north doesnt have enuff to move|pg||
nt|petrosa: with clubs 2-2 slam is good:)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|haans: not easier to find|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ghionis: @S lead to go down|pg||
nt|cicus: lead quite sensible|pg||
nt|flash: if anyone can find a link to the N-S convention card, some of these mysteries might be solved   :)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mcphee: my lord|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|MolvaM: not very enterprising|pg||
nt|mcphee: N did all he could I suppose|pg||
nt|mcphee: the strong hand bids like they have nothing, the weak hand pressed on with key card:)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cicus: looked like N was short in @Ds|pg||
pc|s7|nt|MolvaM: maybe because they play against the president|pg||
nt|tez: and 6 nt with open hands|pg||
nt|lelos: i like a 3@c reopenig with maestro's hand|pg||
nt|eleni: Let's hope Aris Filios will think of the @c slam|pg||
nt|animeshraj: hi everyone|pg||
nt|eleni: Hello Animesh:) welcome:)|pg||
nt|animeshraj: ty:) sry running late here:)|pg||

nt|eleni: Bridge Federation@h@h|pg||
nt|haans: body wouth a lot|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mcphee: S is none too pleased I suspect|pg||
pc|d9|nt|MolvaM: no president likes if her opps make a slam against her on vugraf|pg||
nt|eleni: let us hope that Maria Panagaki will get the hint|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a feeling we missed a lot of alerts|pg||
nt|haans: good lead for 110|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chrisky: nice pass by fotis|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lelos: another push|pg||
nt|animeshraj: wow!|pg||
nt|eleni: don;t worry, 1 more round is followin 10 minutes after this last board|pg||
nt|animeshraj: this cant be a NF 4@C|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mcphee: well maria is going to be unhappy this goes down|pg||
nt|mcphee: she asked if parnter held Q of trumps, and then bid slam anyway:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: must be in hope of a low @D lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: missing 4 trumps including queen you are still more than 50% to make|pg||
pc|dA|nt|eleni: well, Christine can do magic and put to sleep opps:)|pg||
nt|polyvlakas: protonotar did not overcall |pg||
pc|d6|nt|petrosa: after the cue 4@C is forcing|pg||
nt|eleni: weird interpretation by Fotis Skoularikis|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|lelos: we will discuss this hand monday|pg||
nt|eleni: in the other table they were left in their 3NT:(|pg||
nt|petrosa: 3NT is better than 4@C|pg||
nt|animeshraj: with souths hand i dont think he wld play NT|pg||
nt|animeshraj: or want to..|pg||
nt|animeshraj: very nicely thought out by him,,, and he was well on his way to  .. glory|pg||
nt|eleni: As at the open table was said, the round ended up 26-20 for Judy Levi's team and 17-13VPs|pg||
pc|d7|nt|tez: 5@c+4@h+2@d+1@s|pg||
nt|mcphee: if W continues @d there is a chance at success|pg||
nt|harmon: if d played and E lazy she can make|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Even for 140|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|eleni: this is true:):)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: really? shows how good the club is|pg||
nt|bmkl: very clever line by Fotis :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|mcphee: it is hard to find any fault with the auction|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but can understnad 3NT bid after pd shows my two short suits|pg||
nt|eleni: The boys are not members of her club:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: south hopes that @d finesse is off and everyone else gets a @s lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps S with such good @C could advance with 4@C, but at pairs this seems not that wise|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Thats all for now|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Thanks all, see you in about 15 min :)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|nt|rodal f: If there is any children here. Put them at an other room for some minuts:)|pg||

nt|cicus: can play west, the overcaller for @DAK|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: playing very fast|pg||

mb|p|nt|MolvaM: and 5@h now?|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|cicus: many open 1NT with the N hand nowadays|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: as in OR|pg||

nt|haans: good by Kolk to pass 3@C|pg||

nt|chick: if 2@C was natural, then he should have passed 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: what do you bid with east hand?4@c?|pg||
nt|cicus: I am not one of them with a small side doubleton|pg||
nt|haans: wrong hand declaring|pg||
nt|cicus: but N was apparently forced to bid NT anyway|pg||
nt|haans: many say 2@C STAYMAN for ever|pg||
nt|flash: this allows South to protect his tenaces|pg||
nt|flash: a 4@D call would ask opener to bid his major (and tend to deny tenaces)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mcphee: dble very good choice|pg||
nt|MolvaM: this could go for 800|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@C with this nice distribution... dubious|pg||
nt|mcphee: i have no guts to make that sort of weak jump tez|pg||
nt|haans: in sweden 1nt had been natural for 60 years|pg||
nt|haans: with or without 5 cards major|pg||
nt|flash: the @H position (and the @S position) should lead to down 1|pg||
nt|flash: Board 9, which was the beatable 5@C in here, was played in 4@H (!!!) in the Open Room|pg||

nt|mcphee: only 5 cards|pg||

pc|d4|nt|MolvaM: NS can drop a few tricks on defence and still get a top|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|haans: opps hold on to diamonds|pg||
pc|h6|nt|eleni: E-W kids are playing at Lila's Club this evening and they want to win:) they are from a near by Club:)|pg||

pc|hT|pc|s6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|cicus: you can play big club combined with canapé style so that you can bid 1@H with the N  hand|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|mcphee: it came back in the form of a natural @S for W|pg||
nt|haans: many use 1@C-1@D-1@H as relay|pg||
nt|cicus: all methods have drawbacks|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|haans: but 3@H just to much|pg||
nt|chick: yes, NT defense is so much harder when you don't have a suit of your own|pg||
nt|haans: very true|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|chick: two different kinds of NT defense    1. set up your suit and get an entry to it|pg||
nt|haans: at OR west raise 3@H to 4|pg||
pc|h7|nt|MolvaM: well now they know that to bid 4@h is not the way to win|pg||
pc|h9|pc|sT|nt|chick: 2.  figure out where you will get 5 tricks in highcards|pg||

nt|cicus: these -300's don't help Rakvere's case|pg||
nt|haans: suprised the bid it|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mcphee: good 3N for n/s|pg||
nt|cicus: no traps here, an easy 4@S|pg||
mb|4H|nt|MolvaM: EW have a double fit. lets see how high the will go this time|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Flat boards - no hope for the traling team|pg||
mb|4S|nt|haans: bidding to 4@S in OR not standard|pg||
nt|flash: Verhees very active, again, in the Open Room|pg||
nt|flash: 2@S should be @Ss and a minor, less than an opening bid?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|MolvaM: dbl?|pg||
nt|haans: looks like a pen double :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|chick: this session started out with a lot of big swings both directions, but then it got much duller  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: he can only ruff his own spade trick|pg||
nt|haans: xx is still not game|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: E should dblle and west can jump around in @S|pg||
nt|MolvaM: until 4s at least|pg||
nt|mcphee: why he is going so slow this time is a mystery|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgs: 2 off?|pg||
nt|flash: North's action marginal, but understandable|pg||
pc|dK|nt|MolvaM: he learns quickly|pg||
nt|mcphee: this time he has a 4@S bid:)|pg||
nt|haans: sorry 6 spades|pg||
nt|cicus: but it was sensible|pg||
nt|flash: far from clear whose deal it was and 5@H could have been right|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|MolvaM: on a good day 4s might even make|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|haans: nice|pg||
nt|chick: somehow they managed to miss their nice heart fit|pg||
nt|flash: looks as though 1 trick in each suit available|pg||
nt|flash: again, Paulissen's @D2 should have suit preference implications|pg||
nt|flash: one of the issues that seems to have emerged, with these 2-suited opening bids, is that they're used with a very wide range of strengths|pg||
nt|flash: this one, for instance, is a relative monster not vulnerable|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: non vs vul a lot of pairs play it as 0-10|pg||
nt|flash: here, Jansma has to believe that East holds virtually these exact cards, if they're to beat this 2|pg||
nt|flash: given the @D2, Jan might cringe when he shifts to the @CK|pg||
nt|flash: Open Room has finished the set|pg||
nt|flash: since we got a late start, we'd assume that play will resume quite soon after the end of this set|pg||
nt|flash: if the other tables finish, this table might well not play the remaining boards|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cicus: checkback in action again|pg||
nt|haans: but found godd nt|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|MolvaM: 4s now surely|pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: down if S play small to @C9|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c5|nt|MolvaM: oh well almost :)|pg||
nt|flash: they'll still get both their tricks - only one pitch available on the @SK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcphee: W has not reverted to a different flight of fancy:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: now reverted|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|haans: 8 tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|h3|nt|cicus: going for the ruff, not risking @D finesse|pg||
nt|cicus: hard to find a promising lead from the E hand|pg||
nt|haans: do they have a claiming talk?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: no, E just thinking|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mcphee: more @S looked like a better defence|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|c8|nt|haans: no likely|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|chick: bet he wishes he were in 4@H about now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|MolvaM: easts should not have passed the double of 1@s I guess|pg||
nt|mcphee: now S is facing a little problem|pg||
nt|mcphee: looks like he is going down|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe east was trying to apply the brakes from the passenger seat :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: in Greece doubles must not be alerted, so EW learn the meaning just before the lead|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mcphee: so that solves the problem of, I think you are going for 800 dbles:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: oh thats interesting|pg||
mc|9|nt|cicus: N takes the sure route|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: and now playing very fast...sorry|pg||
nt|haans: squeeze in @H+@D|pg||
nt|cicus: and he will be rewarded with an overtrick by means of a squeeze against E|pg||
nt|haans: must loose a clubs to get the count right|pg||
nt|cicus: np the rest plays itself|pg||

nt|mcphee: @S slam going down 1?|pg||
nt|cicus: oh sorry I missed that, then a @D return from east spoils the squeeze|pg||
nt|chick: two more boards for today|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: yes, and again, today we broadcasted all of the A league teams|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: tomorrow we'll have three sessions with the leaders|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: starting at 9.30 (UTC+2)|pg||
nt|chick: I thought he might play @D hoping to find a spade endplay|pg||
nt|haans: North must have 2 spades|pg||
nt|haans: why did he play the Q|pg||
nt|flash: 8 more IMPs it is|pg||
nt|flash: next-to-last board of the set|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mcphee: we expect some frisky interference |pg||
nt|mcphee: oh maybe not over 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: wow, 3@H i want to try suicide again :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: west recovered from his guilt :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: @hA lead could be costly|pg||
nt|mcphee: west goes bonkers only every other board:)|pg||
nt|cicus: apparently, it did not happen|pg||
nt|haans: Riinu been a pleasure  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: thx, but two more boards to go still :)|pg||
nt|haans: sure|pg||
nt|flash: not the most exciting series of boards we've had the hand generator produce, but some very solid results for the Netherlands pairs|pg||
mb|1H!|mb|4C|nt|haans: play of the cards for overtricks not for IMPs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: dopi, dble with zero I expcet|pg||
nt|MolvaM: are they on the same wavelength regarding the number of keycards?|pg||
nt|chick: S barely has an opening hand, so will not push, but N might|pg||
nt|haans: kib agree: Sundiszno: nortIf north had @sQxx, he'd have another card left to discard instead of the last spade|pg||
mb|d|nt|mcphee: N should go|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: just not the right day for it|pg||
nt|MolvaM: initially north was hoping for a grand|pg||
nt|cicus: as I am told declarer could have ruffed a heart high|pg||
nt|haans: DOPI or DOPE|pg||
nt|chick: this will be a very hard decision for N when it comes around to him|pg||
nt|flash: again, the Dutch pre-empt 1 level higher than the Poles|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|haans: gross missunderstanding|pg||
nt|chick: next 'suit' up shows 2 keycards|pg||
nt|chick: although I prefer DEPO above 5 of our suit|pg||
nt|haans: or D = ODD P = EVEN|pg||
nt|chick: on previous hand, a sometime partner of Tihane tells me Tihane showed balanced hand with @c stopper when bidding 1@s, with Tihane, 1@s and 1nt responses to 1@c are reversed; but ...|pg||
nt|chick: the dbl could have confused Dalberg here (probably thought that the system is off)|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: ahh|pg||
nt|mcphee: and it seems his judgement will be rewarded |pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|vugraphzgn: yes, that was it|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: but it wasn't for Tihane|pg||
pc|c6|nt|MolvaM: so difficult not to lead it after pd's 5@h bid|pg||
nt|cicus: lead does not matter here as 2 clubs to lose anyway|pg||
nt|chick: or DOPE as you prefer :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|mcphee: that is true|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: we in Sweden did learn about DOPI 1971 when i was just a beginner|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mcphee: E could have bid 5@C maybe|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzge: smal break|pg||
nt|MolvaM: even @d suit 4-3 would be sufficient to make it against a club lead I guess|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so a very cruel distribution|pg||
nt|mcphee: at last Mom arrives |pg||
nt|mcphee: 2 tops for n/w and one score where pairs might fail in 4@H brought home bye good play from S|pg||
nt|mcphee: surely this will give n/s a little boost in morale|pg||
nt|mcphee: they have played reasonably well thus far|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|h6|nt|haans: has gone round the world|pg||

pc|c3|pc|s5|nt|mcphee: usually F 3@C but here N will break the relay and should bid 3@D|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|cicus: and thanks for specs for your interest|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|mcphee: or 3N as he elected |pg||
nt|mcphee: with that short @C honor I would have tried 3@D|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chick: S should at least consider passing 2N.  non-vul and 4-suit misfit means hard to set up a long suit for tricks|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mcphee: now up to N to try and steal the @D trick|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|haans: not transferring to spade with unbalanced hand?|pg||

nt|chick: understand|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mcphee: not that it will work in his favor mind you|pg||
nt|eleni: still a sound contract|pg||
nt|MolvaM: it seems NS play quite a system with all the artificial bids and transfers. so surprising to have seen them miss a simple major fit on hand  6|pg||
nt|mcphee: he needs to lead @D twice from hand for this plow to have any chance|pg||
