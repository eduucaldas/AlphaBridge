mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|patricck: 3@D and then 3NT looks like a good way to go|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: tony hasnt dont a very good job of trying to play the hand this time|pg||

pc|d2|nt|bjacobs: This is how you bid a pair of 4-3-3-3's?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|rodal f: Or 4@C at all.|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: i think he was thinking: "i don'tknow what to do, tony hasnt bid 3nt, better make him declarer somehow"|pg||

mc|6|nt|bjacobs: It's a stupid auction no doubt, but these things happen.  It all stems from East's pessimism about his @DQxx|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|bjacobs: indeed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: poor martin's only aim in life is to help tony bid 3nt, but tony did not oblige|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|bjacobs: Well, a spec has commented "this isn't bridge".  If indeed his only aim was to help partner bid 3NT, then the spec was right|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|patricck: The spec is being a bit harsh. Every one of us has played a stupod contract every now and then because something went awry.|pg||
nt|patricck: A stupid contract even|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|bjacobs: I agree ... in fact, I think East was just trying to do his best in the bidding.  A misjudgment perhaps, but it WAS bridge|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|s8|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S10?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And he gets it wrong - couping himself|pg||
mc|8|nt|bjacobs: He just had to return a spade - any spade|pg||
nt|bjacobs: stopping the club ruff|pg||
nt|rodal f: Also a ok one.|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: players are just taking a break at the moment|pg||
nt|rodal f: And 2@C is on for minimum 8|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: courtney got some coffee, west has disappeared from the room|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Probably to throw up|pg||
pg||

mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: having a hard time seeing how S could buy this for 2S in other room|pg||
nt|bucheister: but if you redouble and then bid a new suit it must be forcing|pg||
nt|othered1: would you sell to 2@S with the west hand, as in OR?  Would you rebid 2@C?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well i would not majke an insufficient bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: I would rebid 2@d intending to bid 3@c next.|pg||
nt|othered1: Me, too.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bucheister: In modern methods, is double for takeout??|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i think X should be takeout by W, and exactly this hand|pg||
nt|othered1: they can find 500 or so|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|bucheister: yes, me too|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|d7|nt|othered1: How does high @H, pitch @D work here?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S was checkback...checking back if N is deaf|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: rofl|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: tanks and checks EW system card|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe they allow a wide range for that overcall and south felt he had substantial extras?|pg||
nt|othered1: Personally, I like to bid at once preemptively, but pass and come back in wiht good hands in their suit.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what exactly would those extras be? worst possible shape, bad heart holding, diamond king likely ill-placed...|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|s3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well that is one way to go, but pd has to be in on the secret. 2S here is clear in mainstream, methods. but having said it, and seen pd pass at favorable you are done|pg||

nt|rodal f: Will NS be paned if they bid?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So far, they seem to have chucked imps on 5 boards out of 6 ... not a great start|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: it's very sad since most people I know think tony is the best player in australia|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ok he's back and they've picked up their hands|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He probably is ... and he probably hasn't been the chucker|pg||
mb|3S|nt|patricck: Against 4@H by West Q@S lead A@C and J@S though is 3 tricks, declarer may well go down after that. 4@H by East is solid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|vugrapha2: pass is probably ok by bloom, chances are good tony will have short spades and bid|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|patricck: meanwhile.....back in 3@S....  :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: what else can he do?  I think this will be mostly flat around the room|pg||
nt|patricck: Yes, both passes are reasonable, but equally bidding was possible too|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What bids do you think were possible Patrick?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some might open 2@S, but if 3 I agree.|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: if courtney were east he'd havethe 3NT card out in a flash|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|patricck: East is the clearest pass, but West might have balanced with a double|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|patricck: Yes, I know Courtney would bid 3NT|pg||

nt|rodal f: Even not ladies like u Erin?:)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|bjacobs: 3NT is an underrated overcall of a 3-level preempt, but this one seems extreme.  |pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|bjacobs: A four-table Butler?|pg||
nt|patricck: There are 4 teams playing two matches aren't there? Or am I mistaken?|pg||
mc|5|nt|bjacobs: And to be honest, I wonder if Courtney's partner, with the West cards, would let him play there|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think you are mistaken ...|pg||

mb|1H|nt|patricck: Aah, I'm told it is a 7 table Swiss Pairs. In that case i certainly bet against it being completely flat|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and see http://www.nswba.com.au/tourn/res.asp?yr=2010&dir=anc/s3&E=0&R=2&T=R for the pairs and position|pg||

nt|bjacobs: I get legal advice on all my comments|pg||
pc|sT|nt|patricck: An embarrassing number of tricks to take in 4@D|pg||
nt|rodal f: Just wonder if N was to bid 4@C after his 3@D and the force try 3@H from S?|pg||
nt|patricck: oops sorry|pg||
nt|bjacobs: N/S are fortunate that 5@C doesn't quite fetch|pg||
nt|patricck: was thinking both minors were solid...I'll just go and get my specs|pg||

nt|patricck: Only possible swing here is if someone got to an unlikely 6@H, then it would depend on the lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: BUT ... the upside, I suppose, is that 3@H is a transfer to spades, allowing East to declare in that suit|pg||
