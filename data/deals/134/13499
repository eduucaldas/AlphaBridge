nt|Vugraphzgp: Yes, there cc says Canape openings|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sfoxa:  bidding needs explanation, but final contract is OK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: EW play a pretty complicated system over 1NT openings, but I'm not sure how it exactly works|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the main point - it works!|pg||

pc|s2|pc|c3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|yuval10: yes, but when you can perhaps write 90 or 120 in the "plus" side , it hurts|pg||
pc|c4|nt|iceblue: and thats why E passed 1@H|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|yuval10: 4@h and a minor suit?|pg||
nt|mcphee: do not play A@C?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|yuval10: 2@h suppose to be good raise with 8+ points|pg||
nt|sybarra: and E asking for minor |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|sybarra: needs a @D lead or shift after hts, to beat 3 @S |pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  one more example of BD system|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: This could be regular Stayman|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: And Drijver figuring out how high he should bid|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|yuval10: 4@d will go down 1, the defence isn't suppose to be any difficult|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|mcphee: this will depend on the @D guess which I expect E to make correctly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Maybe 3@D instead of X by N would've been more descriptive?|pg||

nt|frankaus: nows the volcano dust in poland? planes flying?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Yeah, though the plane the Polish took was delayed, don't know because of what|pg||

nt|yuval10: the 2 pairs from Israel in this tournement will both represent Israel in the upcomming European championship in Ostende, Belgium|pg||

pc|cK|nt|yuval10: along with a 3rd pair, Ilan and Ofir Herbst|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok quanti,  (I should stick with first thought) |pg||

nt|mcphee: I am assuming N will not discover the killing A@C lead to 3N:)|pg||
nt|iceblue: hehe|pg||

nt|iceblue: must be, S would dble if play STR 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: that is true, but I think this must be 3N not 4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Jansma: "If this goes down I'll buy you a drink" to Paulissen|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: likely @S lead|pg||

nt|andyv:  lead certainly doesn't hurt|pg||
nt|mcphee: well it will all come down to the @D suit in any case|pg||
nt|imp_jan: in the other match barel ducked indeed!|pg||
nt|mcphee: looking like 2-4 leads for the Poles|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Only vs NT, vs suit they lead odd|pg||
nt|imp_jan: though in the middle of the game, decl got a spade lead, and eventually made 4@H dbl|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Or so it seems from previous boards|pg||
nt|mcphee: is this really 4N Bas?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzgp: I'm thinking 1@D Walsh, 1@H unbalanced and 1@S fsf is too easy an explanation, haha|pg||

nt|frankaus: trying for short @C K|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sfoxa:  if clubs are 2-2 - doesn't matter (if 4-0 - too)|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|sybarra: probably a cheerful quiet pass from W |pg||
nt|sybarra: or does S bid again?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: 5@C in S would probably be made, 5@C in N would probably go down, funny things, leads.|pg||
nt|yuval10: hard to pass when your P free-bided with 4@h and you have 20 points. S is also considering the fact his partner is a passed hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: a lot to think about |pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: I agree|pg||
nt|yuval10: his @h suit consist of only 3 cards and has nothing in it, so a lot to consider|pg||

mb|3S|nt|Gerben42: 5@C a control bid, just how N didnt mean RKC|pg||

nt|Vugraphzgp: If 2@C is either weak @D or strong, 3@D is probably barrage, right?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|yuval10: very good decision by S|pg||

nt|mcphee: only see 8|pg||
nt|iceblue: 4@H is the best?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Vugraphzgp: I think the fact that Pachtman had already passed was important in Ginossar's decision to pass 4@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: W also did very well here to bid only 3@s, knowing that he has a very good def. against 4@h|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C can be weak from Pachtman? the auction suggests otherwise|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzgp: Waldemar plays with the NS pair in North American tournaments frequently|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sfoxa:  another reason - to "steel" opps 1 level of bidding. N can be reluctant to bid on 2nd level without good @s support|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Gerben42: south showed a negative response to strong @C and then north didnt push on with 22|pg||

nt|mcphee: ahhh damn!!|pg||

nt|andyv:  Bas, are you telling the players what we are recommending?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Depends on how much they pay me :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 9 is probably the better play but I wouldn't have been leading @cs earlier and wouldn't have to worry about this|pg||
nt|andyv:  would have lead @cs:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes Andy|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Gerben42: that wasnt the way to solve @S...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: On bd  9, Ginossar-Pachtman played 6NT+1, where OR played 3NT+4, 11 to Israel|pg||
nt|Gerben42: impressive 6@D was found in both rooms|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Ginossar's straightforward bid of 4@S last board was rewarded with 2 IMPs as OR played 3NT=|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mcphee: now however declarer is safe for 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|Gerben42: will eventually duck this|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and got interesting position|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  declarer cashes @c and exites with @s, N returns @h and gets 2 more tricks|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  of course, it's easy to see double dummy, but for that class of players it could be clear in practice too|pg||
nt|Gerben42: it all depends who has the @S3|pg||
nt|Gerben42: also a problem what to return after all he can see that pd wont have enough @D to return them and he doesnt want to cash @DA either promoting the Q|pg||

mb|p|nt|flash: the usual sequence for a relay system is to describe shape first, then move on to size and/or controls|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7@C is even DD no piece of cake to make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but @HQ or @S is helpful|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with a good @C lead very doubtful he makes 7@C|pg||
nt|thurston: probably try (in 7) to work diamonds for 3 tricks and that is not going to work|pg||
nt|jaapfr: agree|pg||
nt|jaapfr: DD it is easy to finesse @SQ and make 7@C yes we know specs:)|pg||
nt|thurston: alternate line of spade finesse for heart pitch, heart ruff needs a lot (spade Q on and hearts 3-3)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: that DD line works but SD would be crazy line with 15% chance|pg||
nt|thurston: as suggested may not need hearts 3-3 but certainly not 5-1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pls do not pump my screen blue in telling me that 7@C can make:(|pg||

nt|jaapfr: one comment i like very much: if lead @D8 than the DD line of fin @SQ and @H 3-3 is attractive|pg||
nt|flash: now South knows that North has the 2 red aces and no kings|pg||
nt|thurston: he does know everything he needs to know for 7 except how good N's clubs are |pg||
nt|flash: move the @DQ to @Hs and the grand is possible?   but i think he'll decide that playing partner for the perfect hand is too big a position|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: he can ask about it in presumably 7rounds or something|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pls how to combine and trumping @H and developing @D AND getting trumps out AND having entry for free @D:)???? specs|pg||
