nt|h_karluk: i know full well that 3NT would be reached quite often|pg||
nt|athene: yes, looks hard to avoid 3nt here, with 25 high and some long suits|pg||
nt|roswolf: do n/s really have to bid to 3nt on this one - i dont think so|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sure|pg||
nt|h_karluk: previous board buddy|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Scotland play in a 4-3 fit in OR|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes - after a double and an auction where someon might have bid diamonds - but not a girl's best firned this time|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: of course south's hand is worth about six tricks fewer when north has @CA instead of @CAx :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Looks like 2@s for N/S and 3@c for E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: do you pass with south Liz?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|cuttysark: No - I show my club support|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not that it would make much difference here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: unless it pushes them to 6...diamonds|pg||
mb|2C|nt|nigel_k:  Two very conservative decisions on overcalling by North on this hand and number 31|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|cuttysark: Yes, I suppose it is another slam of a sort :)|pg||

nt|roswolf: another straightforward board i think|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well done..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this time a good score for Scotland from the OR|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They have a toy - 2@D opener to show both majors. Probably wuite sound at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: can go off if played by E perhaps..|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If South finds the diamond lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be the unbid suit..|pg||
mb|1H|nt|nigel_k:  There is a possible 6@h on this hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|cuttysark: 2@S may be spades and any other suit|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: One school of thought says West should buy NT|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt looks pretty good here|pg||
nt|athene: can't you just duck a heart|pg||
nt|athene: opps can cash only @CAKQ at most|pg||
nt|athene: now you have nine tricks if the spades come in or the hearts come in|pg||
mb|5H|nt|cuttysark: I feared that a trump lead might be tempting with this spade holding|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well I though the lead was 50-50..|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North led @HA in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: whats with all these trump leads suddenly...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i think carbon copy auction in OR|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. on @DQ lead you win @DA, unblock the @SJ, and duck a heart|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  West is quite lucky that the East hand is so suitable for slam given East's pass over 2@s|pg||
pc|s6|nt|h_karluk: The important thing is 2@d GF, right?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|athene: ok i just checked - that's exactly what declarer did in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: it was played the other way up but same line|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Declarer can play to set up clubs, or to ruff a diamond. Both lines work here.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If there was no chance of a club trick, the right line would be to cash two rounds of trumps and three rounds of diamonds|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cuttysark: Seems to be the 'in' thing - I am not a fan|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Ace of diamonds holds it to 10 and flatens the board..|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: south's alternative is to go @DA, club and hope south doesn't win the first club trick - then the diamonds are protected|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: sorry west's alternative|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: but that feels inferior|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Making if diamonds are 3-3 or the short diamonds and short trumps are together|pg||

nt|roswolf: this is a trappy hand|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: If one of NS opens, the other hand looks quite good..|pg||
nt|cuttysark: hard to stop at a making level|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Well done by E/W |pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: q@C was a little insulting :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes declarer would never play that way with another club|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But it did end the hand faster|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Playing a weak NT is it inadvisable to open light in 3rd seat - sever danger of being penalised|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  And declarer was bound to make anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|athene: 1@D overcall from north might warn EW off 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: especially when south raises diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: suddenly @DQxx is looking a little bit nervous|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2 way hook |pg||
nt|roswolf: this overcall may help e/w avoid the doomed 3nt but may welll bid to 5@C instead|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|athene: south wants to get spades into it|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: still, should avoid their diamond fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and she will find a fit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: support double?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: doubled 5@c could be a disaster|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|athene: looks as though EW play opener's double as strong notrump|pg||
nt|athene: they might play 1nt rebid there as showing 3 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: west has to restrain herself i feel|pg||
nt|athene: north will bid 2@S now perhaps|pg||
nt|roswolf: and she has:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: they do have a 4-4 fit but she does have a 7 count facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: it would be sad if opps woke up and bid a making game or something|pg||
nt|roswolf: well e/w got that one right|pg||
nt|athene: i am very surprised south didn't bid 2@D over 2@C|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I'm not fond of the light overcalls. It's reasonably effective when it works, but i personally hate the price i've to pay to use it. Givin' up sound overcalls is too great a loss ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for me. To me North's pass was better|pg||
nt|athene: when she doubles, she is taking a big risk of losing the diamond fit, just to try to get a spade fit into the picture|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup - a little suprising i agree|pg||
nt|athene: she was very lucky to be able to catch up and bid 2@D second time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: coffee break|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  E/W did well to stop low|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  4@h is not a very good contract and everything lies badly|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Even 3@h is too much|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|cuttysark: All going similarly to the other room - not an imp has changed hands yet|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Hard for declarer to see any line to make this one|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|wilkinsona: doubtless will try  diamonds..|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|wilkinsona: a lot of straw after the Aces and Kings..|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: north's reticence is understandable - she knows EW have plenty of hcp|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s3|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cuttysark: Diane Greenwood led a low heart to dummy and made 3 tricks in the suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I mean diamond - just testing|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: but i think south was a bit over-cautious there - perhaps if west's double was explained as strong notrump or better, she just "deduced" that her partner had very little, but if ...|pg||
nt|athene: you start working out what partner has on the basis of what opps have shown, you get stung when e.g. east has bid off nothing|pg||

nt|roswolf: west took a flyer in the other room|pg||
nt|cuttysark: You always feel a little silly going 4 down - but these 3N contracts either make or fail by lots|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The defence slipped up a bit there but E/W were always gaining IMPs once they stopped at the two level|pg||
nt|petepunt: poor slam but @S lying well|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  What happened in the open room?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: yes, you have a lot of losers for a 5-level bid at equal vul|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|athene: apart from anything else, there's a really big danger partner might have a monster and take you seriously, and bid six or something|pg||
nt|athene: just pass 4@S and then if partner doubles again, ok, NOW perhaps you have a decision to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|h_karluk: could West does really have a decision after 3@s?|pg||
nt|roswolf: east might double if this is passed to her but west will just bid 4@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: 2N is jacoby and West has to bid 3N with 15-17 bal|pg||
mb|4N|nt|petepunt: they play 12-14 1nt|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They are likely to reach slam then in East knows that West is 15-17|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|athene: 3@S non-forcing here; i assume NS play unusual vs. unusual|pg||
nt|athene: so with a forcing spade bid south would bid 3@H or something|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am quite surprised that W bought 5@c in OR, and paid -800|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: same sequence..|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North led a diamond and South switched to a spade - that worked well|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I hope East isn't thinking of grand|pg||
mb|5N|nt|roswolf: WEST SHOULD STAND THIS|pg||
nt|athene: i think the double of 4@D should show a "strong" 2nt overcall|pg||
nt|h_karluk: overhelming, i hope mine is a fair criticism|pg||
nt|athene: so east doesn't need to double again|pg||
nt|athene: she already showed her hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Spade lead gives a trick|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this may make yet..|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, if she runs @C10|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: even -690 will gain imps!|pg||
nt|petepunt: may not even make 6@H this early in the morning,  its an afternoon play hand! :)|pg||
mb|6D|nt|vugraphzgz: seems to be...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: when 2nt can be such a range of strengths, your first priority is to be able to express the good hand - much more use than emphasising diamonds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and would overthrow partner in post-mortem|pg||
nt|athene: and as a spec points out, if NS bidding is to be believed, west has nothing (north's 4@D was a good spade raise), so doubling 4@S is asking for trouble|pg||
nt|athene: basically it's just asking partner to choose between -690 and -800|pg||
nt|roswolf: the dragon doubles on principle|pg||
nt|athene: i think east is way too aggressive here and she is lucky NS didn't send this back|pg||
nt|athene: maybe they are scared of her :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: redouble the dragon - needs a very stout heart:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unpleasant guess ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i would lead a heart which is clearly one of east's suits|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it won't be easy|pg||
nt|roswolf: sandra taking her time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s doubled looks like a real success story|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks a logical play..|pg||
mb|6H|nt|roswolf: 4th highest of longest and strongest - the old fallback|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: But she does no now hearts are breaking so balyy, may think she just needs 2 club tricks|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|cuttysark: 'does not know...'|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i think declarer would be able to draw the big picture after two rounds of trumps|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||

nt|idc: Both defenders under pressure maybe - possible endplay on East but also a black suit squeeze on West|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: happens too often to me..|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can't say I really like the 2NT overcall opposite a passed hand and with only one stopper|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Scotland managed to bid the slam on Board 32, so they are piling on the points again|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then maybe in a good day they find time to revise the system|pg||
nt|athene: i believe meckstroth-rodwell have the agreement that they don't pass double of 1nt without some values - it's much easier to defend when both hands have some high cards|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: meckstroth in his book said they run to 2@C as a scramble with a weak hand no long suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: actually i disagree but you do need some more refined methods|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's the way we use in USA|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: so if south ran to 2@C, north would pass that|pg||

mb|2C|nt|athene: 4@H here might be plus one |pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: Hi everyone..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and well done to NI for getting here..|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|athene: the clubs are going on spades in good time|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: the only slight issue for declarer is how to lead trumps twice from dummy|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|wilkinsona: 8 top tricks and this lead gives it it seems..|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: I think five card major systems will almost gets to the best game, but because the auctions are oftgen long the defense will be accurate. On the other hand whatever benefits you ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: get from a lot of science, there's a lot to be said for direct, non-informative auctions. It can be very frustrating to play against a four card major system|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: *often - sry for typo|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks straightforward|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Does anything other than 2@s make sense? ie 2N|pg||
pc|h2|nt|nigel_k:  There are eight tricks (1@s, 1@h, 4@d and 2@c)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Maybe another one can be set up in hearts|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: will declarer consider running the @H9?|pg||
nt|athene: play the lead to be a singleton|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|roswolf: people dont often lead sigleton trumps especially an honour|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|h_karluk: i thought south gets his fingers on another spade|pg||

mb|1D|nt|athene: it's always hard to show clubs these days, since bidding clubs at the lowest available level is never natural|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|wilkinsona: this enough to give west a problem..|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|cuttysark: Don't like the double - you can't expect partner to bid either of your long suits|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surely East should have tried 2 spades first time..|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: practical bid by south|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with bidding over a weak notrump is that you actually need to be more disciplined, as game is much more likely, so you have to make it possible to bid constructively|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Four card players aren't always hurting in competition. They have a number of advantages:1-If the other side gets the bid. the opening leader will get off to a good lead 2-They get ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to open with 1@h or 1@s far more often than a five card major player. This can be advantageous for two reasons:a) it's harder to bid over 1@h or 1@s than over 1@c or 1@d b) when ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the opening bidder finds a fit responder can accelerate the bidding|pg||
nt|athene: south's decision here is whether to duck this|pg||
nt|athene: if she was 100% sure west had @SA of course she could win and play a spade|pg||
nt|athene: ducking risks a diamond switch which has its own problems|pg||
nt|athene: if you rise @DA you might have set up too many tricks for the defence|pg||
nt|athene: but if you duck, east puts a heart back and suddenly you are in big trouble|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmvthe ducking looks std|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you just duck this trick and throw a spade from dummy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: A good bridge player should bear in mind that sometimes the person you preempt is your partner|pg||
nt|athene: a) west is unlikely to find the diamond switch and b) even if she does you are quite likely to survive rising @DA|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Unless it would be the dreaded negative freebid - my idea of the worst convention ever|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: NS made it hard - but so did the system|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: the defence aren't cashing three diamonds most of the time|pg||
