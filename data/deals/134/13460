nt|frankaus: 4@S/4@H  is usually a good option|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: but brave at theses colours|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|rodal f: 3@C a Bergen raise it seems. I am shure that Bergen is a town in Norway west:) Hehehe|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well this is a phantom sacrifice|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: perhaps they do not play neg freebids, and W just decided to bid 2S anyway|pg||
pc|h3|nt|frankaus: more imps to the leaders|pg||
nt|peachy: there are no convention cards available so let me clarify I am guessing|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or maybe bid to make|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rodal f: K&R told 17.20 for N at last hand: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=54+AKQ1083+43+A97|pg||
nt|sybarra: better than a club lead maybe|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but more defensive, all those Queens|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|peachy: in these colors particularly brave|pg||

nt|rodal f: Belive S took N for a bit better cards then he have.|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: only lead that may give declarer problems (we can see from here but not at table) is q @H's|pg||
