nt|mdgraham: I wonder if West took the 4@H bid there as the ace|pg||

nt|henryb:  I remind kibitzers of my personal rule: I will generally not respond, and I will certainly not respond to anyone who keeps their name private or undisclosed|pg||

nt|tez: drop 8 of @s..yes with double dummy|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|an|gf|nt|marlowepi: can do it either by 3rd round finesse of club 8, or by an elimination against E. but you must getthe shapes right|pg||
nt|snorris: well..3 nt CAN be won but..|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|cuttysark: North led his club and got a ruff with his trump trick - as usual, this line of defence let the contract through|pg||
nt|tez: or play 10 of @s..and give 1 @s to defenders|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well that requires a LOT more than the other lines|pg||
nt|tez: pich a @c from dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: actually the total chances of each approach are maybe not that far apart|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cuttysark: "Trump strength - lead length"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one more try|pg||
nt|marlowepi: suprised though that N did not bid 4H the time before--maybe that would be kickback|pg||
nt|marlowepi: asking for keycards i mean|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  in CR, W opened 1N and N never got into the auction|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Generally a sound strategy, Roland|pg||

pc|c6|nt|andyv:  in CR, auction went 1@h 2@d and now N jumped to 4@h|pg||

nt|snorris: 5 @c e-w|pg||
mb|1C|nt|cuttysark: I expect this is some sort of pre-empt...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Thank you - a good pre-empt in either major. Slam still tough to bid|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East needs to find out about the singleton diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi:)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|an|neg|nt|cuttysark: over a Multi many play that 4@C says - 'transfer into your major' and 4! says 'bid your major'|pg||
nt|snorris: even 3 nt|pg||
mb|2C!|an|transfer|nt|tez: dbl shows @s's..2nt?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|marlowepi: 2H about as high as NS want to go|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: useful to play these transfers in competitive auctions (as longa s you remember them)|pg||
nt|snorris: n-s have a good sacrifice in 4 @ds|pg||
mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: though with super friendly layout a game could make|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: And they do the same over their unusual Multi 3@D|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East sees no reason for the lead to come up to his hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as they give more options: South can show diamonds first, and then support hearts (not here, of course)|pg||
nt|snorris: and 5 @ds|pg||
nt|snorris: on 5@cs|pg||
mb|6C|nt|marlowepi: perhaps 2N by S would have been a heart raise. otherwise it looks like the obvious value call|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tez: I was afraid of 4@s bid(N)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when E does not neg X, spades are probably not a fatal concern|pg||
nt|snorris: yes west IS agressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not sure why W is thinking. NV opps unlikely to fail by more than one|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: told you so|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this contract appears to have a slight flaw|pg||
pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: even thinking could easily cost a trick in trumps|pg||
nt|snorris: king asks for count?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: y|pg||
pc|h9|nt|tez: all leads are down 2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe not|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Play will be brief|pg||
nt|tez: No communication|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: if 9 of D went up at trick one, N had some chances|pg||
