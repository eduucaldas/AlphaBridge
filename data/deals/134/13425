nt|justin c: welcome back all|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: hi everyone. play just getting underway|pg||
nt|justin c: 5@D for EW here, 6 makeable|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi all|pg||
nt|justin c: hi geoff|pg||
nt|lark20: Good morning all|pg||
nt|justin c: the previous set was horrible for wales - will see if they regrouped during the break|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: yep |pg||
mb|3N|nt|iain sime: Good morning all.|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: cue bid then @D from W to show a serious raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: Do people prefer dble from the E hand here?|pg||
nt|justin c: prefer 1@D myself|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed just avoid the 3nt trap is the name of the game here|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: no show the suit is right|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzha: 2@D might only be 3 as 1NT was forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: can you in Europe see the ash in clouds? |pg||
nt|vugraphzha: seems a beautiful clear day here actually|pg||
nt|justin c: easy to see a X getting into trouble|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: how does dble get into trouble?|pg||
nt|justin c: W might cue 2@C and continue with @H|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|sybarra: had friends in Europe saying similar,  didnt see "bad"" |pg||
nt|vugraphzha: quite rare for manchester|pg||
nt|sybarra: *didnt seem  |pg||
nt|justin c: this 3@D bid is a bit obscure|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D looks the spot on the bidding to date|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make up to 3@C    n/s  can compet in spades  and may make 9 tricks unless defence can take 2 diamond tricks before hearts are established for a pitch of a diamond|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|justin c: no real reason for East to find a heart lead|pg||
pc|d9|nt|iain sime: 4@C should be one light after a normal spade lead.|pg||
nt|ady: dbl from east sub minimum =  the fashion now|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lark20: she will always do this especially with 5 hearts|pg||
nt|iain sime: Still one light but the defence will have only one more chance to cash two spades.|pg||
nt|ady: dont think that will be too difficult|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi all|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|justin c: the @DK does declarer no harm at all|pg||
pc|sT|nt|roswolf: well 4@H was obscure|pg||

nt|roswolf: not really|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h6|pc|dQ|pc|s5|pg||

nt|Walddk7: because the Irish teams were stranded on the island|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess at the auction is 1 s-p 2c-2 ht 2 nt p 3 nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup welsh gold to the fore|pg||
nt|iain sime: 3@S was makeable, so this was as good a result as Scotland could get (apart from an unrealistic pass by Sam in 4th seat).|pg||
nt|ady: slam time|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2D!|nt|ady: there are only 11 obvious tricks in hearts  but 2 ways to make the 12th|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is the game contract|pg||
nt|mug: good afternoon|pg||
mb|3C|nt|roswolf: messy hand this|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: 2@C is nat GF|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@H is where you want to land|pg||
nt|roswolf: but could/should be defeated if played by east|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S looks plausible but has its difficulties|pg||
nt|justin c: hi Tom|pg||
nt|mug: you can't really go off|pg||
nt|justin c: 6@C has its difficulties too|pg||
nt|mug: just knock out @CA and then @SAK, North can take his two trump winners at his leisure|pg||
nt|mug: ah sorry I'm in the wrong room, bye|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3N|nt|sybarra: rebid of the spade suit by W?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  or kind of invite?|pg||
nt|justin c: seems inevitable|pg||
nt|justin c: @S ruff availalbe for NS|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: ruff finesse the Q@C works   also pull 2 trumps only and play diamonds hoping if they are 4-2  the hand with 4 diamonds has the outstranding trump|pg||
nt|iain sime: Both pairs play weak NT and weak twos in the majors. NS also play five card majors and a short club.|pg||
nt|ady: may also play a minor suit squeeze which fails|pg||
nt|lark20: 2NT is Baron 15+ showing 3/4 card support|pg||
nt|iain sime: Can probably beat game by defending here. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: or just bid game  LOL|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  straight to game - good vulnerable approach in match|pg||
nt|ady: singleton spade lead kills the line of drawing 2 trumps only and playing 4 rounds of diamonds as it works up to then  but no quick way back to hand to draw the last trump and north ...|pg||
nt|ady: can win A@C and give a spade ruff|pg||
nt|justin c: if they dont take it, can guess the @H position to get two spades away|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: will be disappointed to only take 4 sp tricks |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: now how accurate will the defence be?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|justin c: 2@C was GF by the looks of this|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|nt|iain sime: This may not be best. There are eleven tricks and provided South hangs on to her diamonds England have won 13 imps.|pg||
nt|ady: no way to get the 12th trick here    other than 3-3 diamond break  or an unlikely squeeze position in in clubs and diamonds|pg||
nt|lark20: In a heart contract, could always take a ruffing finesse in clubs|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: this looks booked for -800|pg||
nt|justin c: well, this is going a lot off|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sfoxa:  interesting position in @d|pg||
nt|iain sime: My guess is that Sam placed the @S ace with North and wanted to declare with @SKQx.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lark20: Presumably she chose 6NT to protect her spades|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|sfoxa:  @d K will block the suit for a while|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S has to duck next @c|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps even -1100|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: has to be otherwise east was overbidding wildly - she only has a 9 count after all|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: this effectively promotes another trump trick|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c8|pg||
nt|justin c: as I understand things, West's pass over 4@H was encouraging East to bid on|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|sybarra: will do since N will win club with q |pg||
pc|d5|nt|lark20: Sorry Ian both saying the same, but I am slower|pg||
nt|roswolf: should have overruffed|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: and beginning to give S a bit of a problem |pg||
pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  ouch!|pg||
nt|sybarra: now has to figure it out for the up trick |pg||
nt|justin c: & west underbidding even more wildly|pg||

nt|justin c: looks that way|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c4|pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h3|nt|ady: England played in a safe 4 hearts making 6 in closed room  and will be please when they compare as it is possible Scotland could have bid and made 6@H|pg||
nt|iain sime: North has pitched spades in suit preference order to show clubs, but South knew to hold diamonds from looking at dummy.|pg||

nt|roswolf: south's last call was gambling|pg||
nt|justin c: EBU, that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: e/w might try 4@H HERE|pg||
nt|justin c: north hand could have been a touch more useful than it actually was|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|ady: North should have kept an extra spade and 1 less club in the 4 card ending|pg||
mb|d|nt|iain sime: A vulnerable psyche!|pg||
nt|lark20: That is a weak opening bid especially Vulnerable|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt also made in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: S may have thought keeping the @D's was better |pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: this might get feisty|pg||
nt|ady: how high will south go?|pg||
nt|justin c: not pleasant against a @D lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzha: 1NT rebid was 15/16|pg||
nt|roswolf: east is wet in not bidding over the weak nt|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: McGee in the other room,  raising for 3 seems a bit much to me  |pg||
nt|roswolf: finis|pg||
nt|ady: e/w too high and the opening bid will get the right lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: can see it will survive on this layout (doubleton @HA and no entry to the long @D)|pg||
nt|roswolf: west might bid on with those crisp controls but selects a stolid pass|pg||
nt|copeyj: west would be mad to raise|pg||
nt|copeyj: KJ@S under the overcall and partner not good enough to bid 2@h in an acol style|pg||
nt|roswolf: 10 imps to Wales probably|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|sybarra: the East hand raised to 3 |pg||
nt|roswolf: the club 6 is a great card for declarer|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzha: raising to 3 seems a bit unlucky none of her Qs working and p having so much in @Cs|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h2|nt|iain sime: South has respected her partner's pass- or seen her openers before. |pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: this should be 2 down in 3 to flaten the result in OR where England were way too high|pg||
nt|lark20: I suppose she did limit her hand with the 2NT bid|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|sfoxa:  8 points and 5-cards suit - good reason to rise|pg||
nt|justin c: wales played in 4@S on the previous board, 2 off|pg||
nt|lark20: Declarer must be wondering which opponent's bid to believe|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|justin c: for a 3 imp gain to england|pg||
nt|roswolf: DIAMOND PIPS NOT BAD EITHER|pg||
pc|d2|nt|justin c: I see 7 for declarer, but no eighth|pg||

pc|d4|nt|justin c: need to play East down to just clubs, then endplay|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: was going to say n/s may play 4 @S X |pg||
nt|iain sime: West has shown a minimum balanced hand too strong for 1NT. With more she would have ventured 4@D (last train) over 4@C.|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: spade was best lead |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: 2 nt is the weaker (relay) bid typically |pg||
nt|ady: great switch|pg||
nt|iain sime: West would have done better to lead her partner's suit. Not that one can fault a club in their four card major style.|pg||
nt|justin c: needs a @C lead|pg||
nt|justin c: and this looks suspiciously like a @S|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|justin c: seems to me east should bid over 1NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm this is strange i would never defend 1nt with the east hand|pg||
nt|justin c: must be likely that NS are headed into a major suit, why not preempt, indicate the lead, remove their stayman, etc|pg||
nt|roswolf: will west win and switch to a spade?|pg||
nt|roswolf: the trouble is that she might switch to a heart|pg||
nt|justin c: yes - i'm sure that the @H5 indicated a @S entry (dont know their methods)|pg||
