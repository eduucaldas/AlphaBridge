nt|ralfwil: Good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: Fishpool the epitome of an expressive french woman a very experienced player good card player|pg||
nt|lestergold: liikes to double if she smells blood|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sharkey: The Levy team has opened a commanding lead|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all and welcome.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: She and her husband Steve were Young Chelsea members years ago  |pg||
mb|d|nt|cuttysark: Good morning|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzxs: hi|pg||
nt|lestergold: yesd it is sad that steve doesnt play bridge he is a very talented player|pg||
nt|sharkey: off shape t/o Dbl by Ms Clement|pg||
nt|lestergold: but it is right fopr her to double with those values and 4 good spaders|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcwla: Hi, Quentin.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good afternoon, everyone|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi, Liz.|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|daman: looks like a normal 3NT fvor EW?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxs: hi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good morning|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sharkey: looks like EW can make 4@S...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: An exciting board to start|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: W has a problem now - 3@C may have been better than x|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am quite impressed with the 1@H overcall - don;t think I would bid such a bad suit in the sandwich position|pg||
nt|sharkey: not sure - W needs IMPs so may blast into a few @D....|pg||
mb|4D|nt|lestergold: not enuf to keep the Fish out o 4@h|pg||
nt|sharkey: may be 1@S is preferable to Dbl?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|daman: would 2NT show 16?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Liz. Hi to all.|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think 2@H is meant as forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: invitational|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: A fast auction to the normal spot: South rebids her spades to show at least 5, North denies support|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: negative diamond lead looks best|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: Good morning|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed - seems to attack communications and wait for tricks in the other suits|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning all |pg||
nt|ady: good morning David|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Spades lie quite well for declarer, who will probably look for tricks there|pg||
nt|cuttysark: (and good morning, Louis and Davids)|pg||
nt|daman: otherwise she could transfer|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cuttysark: Swift auction to the gran slam -|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks like 2 down, a small save against 400|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sharkey: View N has @SK) the spots are good enuff to pull trumps|pg||
nt|sharkey: @SK9|pg||
nt|jcwla: Looks like 4NT is the ask, 5@S shows two with the @CQ, 5NT shows the presence of all key cards, and 7@C is made with the side source of tricks.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree. A 1@S overcall is an attractive possibility, as that is the suit you would like partner to lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: seems only realistic play is QX spades with east|pg||
nt|xenya: where's the 9th trick|pg||
nt|daman: can make 9 tricks double dummy|pg||
nt|daman: a low @D now will give him 9 perhaps|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|nt|cuttysark: She is unlucky in her finesses|pg||
nt|jcwla: 15 tricks at notrump, but at IMPs the most important thing is to get to the grand.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed, if all the aces are present it is hard to imagaine a hand with no play for the Grand|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ady: diaond continuation seems best|pg||
pc|sA|nt|daman: on balance   it will be a struggle|pg||
nt|xenya: let's see -- N wins and switches to spades...|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: Hi everyone..|pg||
nt|iain sime: Good morning all.|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: sorry, internet cable kicked out.|pg||
nt|sybarra: due to the flight delays, the tourney has been compressed, this will be 12 bd round |pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|nt|cuttysark: Doesn't seem very nice to call the Scottish player Lame|pg||
nt|cuttysark: and good morning to you all|pg||

nt|cuttysark: So who are these 'Scots'?|pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: Wales seem to be NS and EW here.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not Grant-Macdonald I can tell you|pg||
nt|rmb1: This is the third round of matches (this match completes tomorrow).  EBU v Northern Ireland.  EBU are the host team to make an even number of teams|pg||
nt|rmb1: NS play weak NT and open four card suits|pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugraphzhb: Hello all.|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: N-S are playing for Wales in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: well, they have done well to get the event started at all...|pg||
nt|iain sime: I guess Adamson Symons are NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: We are few but good today :)|pg||
nt|rmb1: East has showed her confidence about this, and partner's CJ may be a trick as well.|pg||

nt|sharkey: 1 NT by E - may be final contract?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe after minors it is not so clear - 2@D Michaels?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Anyway, she has reduced the lead by 3 imps|pg||
nt|daman: giving or receiving?|pg||
nt|daman: :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: can they get to 5@C?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2S|nt|garnetts: true but there was a more obvious end play |pg||
nt|ady: 4@S an excellent game for e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: giving them|pg||
nt|lestergold: they may think they are saving in 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: dont think NS will enter into the fray VUL|pg||
nt|xenya: repeated spade leads would have beaten 3N i think |pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - unlikely - I think - unless pushed|pg||
nt|lestergold: what does 2@s mean here?|pg||
nt|sharkey: must be a type transfer?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: @c transfert|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S? A psyche? Or showing clubs...|pg||
mb|2N|nt|garnetts: not enamoured with the 2@C overcall prefer 1NT |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looking at the NS hands, 4@H is pretty good - sinks on the 4-1 break|pg||
nt|ady: even with spade king offside can make if getting diamond position right|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@H is unlucky to fail |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: S thinks otherwise|pg||
nt|cuttysark: When I was commentating yeserday there were a lot of slams - here we go again|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The trick here is to avoid the 7-level|pg||
mb|3C|nt|henryb:  Players are getting more and more aggressive entering against strong 1N openers|pg||
nt|daman: 2@H must be 5-4 majors and weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Now West needs to set up a game-forcing auction, set hearts as trump, and find out that partner has the right controls|pg||
nt|xenya: however it was made in the other room too -- so that wasn't too easy |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Must show clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Nice 4@S bid here to help them avoid getting too high with W not holding any @S's.|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: well well !!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3@H is a Fit Jump - shows clubs as well as hearts|pg||
nt|sharkey: View S and E totally combine for 30 HCP+ S is lucky to catch this good a dummy|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Important to discuss the difference between 3@S and 4@S after a 2-level response|pg||
nt|lestergold: more likely the latter my prediction is 5@c doubled|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|cuttysark: In Acol she could make a strong jump shift to 2@S, then bid 4@H to showthis hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South raising to 3@D would make things awkward - now West can cue-bid 3@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very thin contract which we can see can be defeated double dummy|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H makes..|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh im wrong|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - @S lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: beats it|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: dim switch|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW a tad passive here|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ady: west came in late    will be pleased with dummy|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cuttysark: When opponents have a double fit.... so do you|pg||
nt|daman: too bad dummy didn't have 10x of @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: the heart switch is very far from obvious here|pg||
nt|lestergold: ironically it can still be defeated providing Fishpool does not continue spades|pg||
nt|xenya: once again, 9th trick can't be readily found|pg||
pc|d3|nt|henryb:  I am not sure it is wise. On this hand South will make 110, but she would have made 100 on defense|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sharkey: surprised W didnt go on|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cuttysark: Asking about spades she will find that the queen is missing and avoid the Grand...|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|daman: this will be easy now   |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cuttysark: And, having bid all 5 denominations, she finally reveals her heart support at the 6-level!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: well, AK10x is adequate support|pg||
nt|lestergold: very expenive if this is let thru|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|garnetts: I acnnot believe that she played a club--will south be able to read it |pg||
nt|ady: down now with diamond played|pg||
nt|garnetts: South will think she has six spades maybe--|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Norths diamond lead must be a singleton |pg||
nt|cuttysark: (Easy for me to see, I guess, but why else lead dummy's suit?|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would take 3@S as setting trump and asking for control bidding.  A jump to game seems more of this type of hand: nothing but @S's but an opener rather than a preempt.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: at this stage of the match|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|garnetts: Oh dear|pg||
nt|xenya: NS have 5 tricks now -- can they get them?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well  very cheeky contract let thru because Fishpool was frightened of giving more awayby switchimg|pg||
pc|sA|nt|daman: the @D K was ill advised|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sharkey: cud be double score...|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i think Fish is a trick short one way or the other|pg||
nt|sharkey: problem now - cant pull trumps|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|sharkey: W has shown 10 cards in @C & @H|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: the ten o spades will come into its own|pg||
nt|lestergold: or is this squeeze?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: only chance singleton @DJ or 10 in West|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: well done|pg||
nt|lestergold: rast discarding in front|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: well they did after al.l played catch up|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: jdims and it was made|pg||
nt|lestergold: west failed to count her tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: or failed to count the opponents tricks |pg||
nt|mdgraham: or...wait a mo...East has to discard.... |pg||
pc|c6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|garnetts: no choice but to lead a @D if you think about it|pg||

nt|vugraphzhb: 2@D is at least 9 cards in @Ss and another suit|pg||

nt|vugraphzhb: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2010/ladymilneteams.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: The strong 1NT suggests our pair are Adamson/Symonds|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@H to play opposite the majors|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|marlowepi: je m'etonne que S n'a pas dit 1SA|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: 3@C pass or correct: to play in partner's second suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: Miad Grant and Sheila Macdonald are EW in the open room. Sam doesn't do mornings (if she is given the choice). Hence why I am guessing Sheila Adamson and Ane Symons are NS.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|iain sime: Sorry Maida and Anne mis-typed.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The clue is in the NT range - A/S are the only strong NT pair, Sheila Adamson usually sits North|pg||
nt|bg: Hi all!  1 NT seems like a good spot  N has a tough lead to make|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cuttysark: Slightly surprising that South did not open - she is just back from her honeymoon and might bein optimisitic mood|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|iain sime: West would have done better to rise ace. But 3NT could have made anyway- win the third club and rely upon the spade king.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: 6 IMP ca coute assez cher, surtout pour l'equipe qui a besoin des points|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s6|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Just the plan Sheila is adopting|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|nt|iain sime: Winning the first club would have worked when West ducked. |pg||
nt|cuttysark: The altenative, playing East for @SA and @HK was unlikely to work|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think you can see that she has played @CA Iain :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess the auction in the other room had a similar meaning,  2@S = S + m.  2NT asking for minor.|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|iain sime: Sorry, I thought she had put in the nine.|pg||

nt|cuttysark: If you put your mouse over the Closed Room contract you see their auction|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W could have set up more pressure on NS by taking the 6 @c tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, that makes things difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: had east discarded a spade it may have been harder for the Fish|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sharkey: Well, Reess team need IMPs so have to do something.  So far this worked out|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Flat board. Auction at the other table did not really address the spade issue, it seems.   |pg||
nt|cuttysark: QUite similar  but over 1NT West could bis a forcing 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: hard to beat 3NT here|pg||
nt|lestergold: ditch 2 spades and keep club q she was down|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: however 4@h may well be the contract|pg||
nt|daman: 4@H by East would be a struggle|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sharkey: Misfits coing up...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Rebid 2@H or 2@S here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: right u are Carl|pg||
nt|sharkey: not the start Reess team were looking for|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Another brave bid, from South this time|pg||
nt|daman: same auction in the CR|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@H makes I think|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|cuttysark: 5th highest lead clarifies the count in diamonds for everyone|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I prefer 2@H because that may be where we want to play - I would need better spades for 2@S|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, the @S's look like five, don't they?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 5@c4|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: some might have competed with 2@S with east hand   vulnerability may have beeb influential|pg||
nt|daman: they led the @S Queen in the CR|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, S can hope to find at least 1 fit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cuttysark: I wonder what that double means - if penalty it is a big view|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: EW can make 5@D I think; have to work on @S suit - not @H.  3 NT easier....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi all|pg||
nt|henryb:  E-W can make game, but only game in either red suit. I agree with Canonne that West is worth a reverse, but it may be hard to keep Clement from overreaching to slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Hamdi|pg||
nt|sharkey: W forced to bid 3 NT now?|pg||
nt|xenya: re previous hand: 3N cant be made even if declarer puts in the @DJ -- suppose she runs the clubs and plays the @HK -- N wins and cashes the @SQ squuezzing declarer out of the 9th ...|pg||
nt|xenya: trick |pg||
nt|lestergold: yes an interesting position i didnt see it |pg||
pc|h4|nt|garnetts: a bit of a coffee hand now---maybe a lot of players would double 2@H with the East hand--I would have risked 2@S |pg||
nt|cuttysark: A low club lead and a couple of heart ruffs would have been an exciting defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear as so often happens towards wbs if nattchwa wyrgbug deficits|pg||
nt|sharkey: earlier shud read :not the start Levy team were looking for|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear my typing eight of the rails|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sharkey: After West's reverse 3@S must be forcing....|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - East's 3@S|pg||
nt|henryb:  Clement obviously thought 3@s was forcing. Canonne thought she had done enough opposite a misfit|pg||
nt|sharkey: this may not make either....|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|nt|lestergold: that heart play was it 100% safe?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I didn't know you spoke Klingon, Mike|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cuttysark: But even this useful looking spade position is not enough for declarer - cannot ruff 2 diamonds without establishing East's @S8|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: This hand is everyones 4@H contract--a spread too|pg||

pc|s8|nt|cuttysark: Looks like an accurate stop - provided the defenders cash their clubs there are 5 losers|pg||

nt|h_karluk: think that's not fair. Sometimes good bidding punished while bad bidding rewarded|pg||
nt|jcwla: I like the 3@S -- knows they have a safe home in @D's and E may (and did) really want to hear about the @S card there.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: probably nine tricks here - NS unlikely toi switch to clubs when they win the @SA|pg||

nt|ady: good bid by west|pg||
nt|ady: this comes home with diamond finesse right|pg||
nt|jcwla: I wonder whether 3@H is invitational or forcing.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The jump to 3@H is unusual nowadays - many play 2@H as forcing and 3@H as a splinter|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East now has a problem that she didn't want|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cuttysark: Indeed - when partner doubles at her second shot there is a reason why she did not double first time - hand is flawed|pg||
pc|d3|nt|henryb:  If she guesses right to go up and continue the suit she will have good defensive chances|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cuttysark: "The 5-level belongs to the opposition" - or was that "When in doubt, bid one more?"|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: 3C and 2 M losers for EW|pg||
nt|sharkey: West's 4@C opening VUL CR not my first choice....|pg||

nt|daman: are we all on the same hand?|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@S is likely to fail on a minor-suit lead...|pg||

pc|s7|nt|h_karluk: kind of shouting : hey i am weak, double me!|pg||

nt|sharkey: may be off 2 now - if ducking|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Unless they find the diamond lead.|pg||
nt|xenya: now one @H trick is enough|pg||

pc|s6|nt|ady: north needed to take some action with 4 cards in both majors  and risked a response in clubs|pg||

pc|c4|pg||

nt|lestergold: a second crack at the spade suit with the dim ten dropping well....|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ralfwil: As I play on a hand like this  3nt from W shows a balanced hand and partner can decide|pg||
nt|lestergold: east had a clearcut no trump raise|pg||
pc|h8|nt|daman: they tried the same strategy in the CR and East opted for @Ss|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cuttysark: case for opening 1@D in third seat to ensure the best lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuttysark: If one could Michaels with 5-4 this would be the perfect hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt immediatly was a rude bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: We seem to be having our customary teething problems in the first match. We have now got the NS pair correct in this match, but East is still Lame|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: duly found here now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rmb1: Difficult for EW to compete when NS bid both the opponent's 8 card fits|pg||
nt|jbgood: anything but passing 1@h was a winner here - even the (more) normal 1 NT would get clubs into the picture|pg||
pc|c9|nt|cuttysark: Even a heart lead does not beat this - it is decalrer-proof|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D search the possibility to play a slam in a minor|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with Q in @D in North instead Q in @h slam in @D is the ricgth contract|pg||

pc|d3|nt|bridge_one: @C and @D in South|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||

nt|xenya: well done by EW here|pg||
nt|sharkey: think the great Wohlin once asked his pd when leading from Axxx - "Trying to make your ace good pd?"|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: would we double 1 @S with the East hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: sure Carl|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S looks like the best strain here....|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: What E does over 1@H-1@S-2@C will tell the tale of this hand.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|h_karluk: seems everything is on the right spot there|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: if she had 3 clubs when a low one was led ducking was right --cannot remember if she had 2 or 3 |pg||
nt|daman: the silence is deafening|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If it´s my only chance to act - yes|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mdgraham: one of those exciting things - if West had opened 1@D, NS would not have bid to 3NT |pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5@C is beaten y leading 3 rounds of diamonds, and so promoting a trump trick.|pg||
nt|lestergold: coffe hand 3n has to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: if partner has A@C then fine if not then she has the K@D |pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: You can look it up - go to Movie and click on the result|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in 5@c, W leads @d triple and promotes @c Q |pg||
nt|lestergold: doesnt matter 6@c aslo makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 i meant|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@c not 6 0fm course|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: i see nothing wrong with the double|pg||
nt|lestergold: with 4@h and an opening bid however min i would double the opening bid for sure|pg||
nt|daman: EW can make at least 3 H and probably more|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Looks a normal 2@H - she has enough to keep the bidding open in case partner is quite strong|pg||
pc|d9|nt|h_karluk: over D 2H F/NF , that's the question |pg||
nt|henryb:  I too would bid 2@c, but E-W had an ENORMOUS number coming on defense|pg||
nt|jcwla: W's 2@S rebid should show this type of hand and these extras.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cuttysark: Tough problem for West now|pg||
nt|cuttysark: One of my 'things' is that if you want to open light in 3rd seat you should have a good suit, one you want partner to lead|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: very sensible|pg||
nt|xenya: not ideal with AJ of spades but reasonable|pg||
nt|lestergold: are they gonna go overboard missing two bullets |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|sharkey: I play it NF - Forcing on 1 level only|pg||
nt|daman: I would be a doubler|pg||
nt|daman: as Barry Crane said     "get in and get out"|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|daman: more a MP startegy though|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h not a greqat contract happens to be two finesses right but e/w should be in ths auction|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ady: seems like 3NT some sort of relay?|pg||
nt|garnetts: she had 3 so ducking was best --Thanks Liz|pg||
nt|jcwla: W has an awfully good hand even in context but gives partner some leeway and another really nice auction by E/W.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I guess 5@C is not too bad a contract, but the singleton ace would be better if it were the ace of hearts|pg||
nt|sharkey: dont go for coffee, Mike....|pg||
nt|lestergold: backwood seems to have been invoked just in timw|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I hope that is not read as three|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cuttysark: East-West have realised that they have two club losers, and stopped safely in game|pg||
pc|cT|nt|cuttysark: Could 3NT be the dreaded Serious Slam Try?|pg||
nt|sharkey: many play 2@H after 1@S - Dbl - 2@H shows good @S raise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so that might help to avoid minor suit competition|pg||
nt|lestergold: if it does you can send the fat lady in|pg||

nt|lestergold: coffee much needed thk the lord|pg||
pc|s5|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: may have pushed n/sto the unmakeable 4@s|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|henryb:  I think the modern approach is to play forcing at the one level and transfers at the two level. This sacrifices the natural 2@c response but gaains lead directing raises and the distinction between constructive and weak raises of opener's suit|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: free rides dont win matches|pg||
nt|daman: many matches are won/lost on competitive partscore hands|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer to act as early as possible and am also not so fond of balancing|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|sharkey: West elected to bid 2@C after pd's Rdbl,  Normally bidding after pd's Rdbl shows a weak opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: someone gonr to bed with dim ace?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|sfoxa:  3@c should be "color+fit" bid - gooad approach to reach game on limited values |pg||
pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: not sure if EW play 30/41 or 14/30 - so it could be 0 or 3, I guess|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: I know, operator|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|Walddk4: You need to insert scores on boards 1-4 manually after you should down|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Only then will we see comparisons|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|cuttysark: 2NT presumably a 3-card limit raise|pg||
nt|iain sime: 2NT will be an invitational three card raise. |pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: interesting hand|pg||

nt|sybarra: e/w can take first 9 tricks but not easy to sort out |pg||
nt|jbgood: there is a case for a double on the S cards.. but a passed prd was enough to persuade Penfold that pass was the better bid|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cuttysark: Best to lead a shrt suit when you have so many trump - you want to ruff to aovid being emdplayed|pg||

mb|p|nt|rmb1: This could be more exciting - there is certainly play for 6@H|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: or average|pg||
nt|toobad: they might find 6H here|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jbgood: "play for it" is an understatement:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: the auction in the other room is v conservative|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2NT is a constructive raise to 3 or better|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 3NT is human, but down if opps guess the line to play|pg||
nt|bg: another interesting hand this makes even with a dia lead|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: with @D lead is down|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: losing 2@D 2@H and 1@C|pg||
nt|bg: on dia lead S ducks first round  however EW can prevail on three rounds of dia if W throws club queen|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now made because can lose the @C having the control in @D|pg||
nt|jbgood: there are so many treatments after the fitshowing 2 NT - quite a few would end in 6|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Looks ike a loser in each suit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after Q@D lead, south must duck|pg||
nt|jbgood: i wonder why N in the OR didnt bid 4 @c instead of 4@h|pg||
nt|rmb1: but denies a splinter (3NT = 8-11 with shortage, 4suit = 11+ shortage)|pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: 4S shouldn't make here- a trick in each suit.|pg||
mb|p|pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|cuttysark: If spades broke game might make if decalrer took the best view in diamonds|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|lark20: Surely 3S was just competitive|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after opps can take AK@H, 1@C and A in @D|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jbgood: strange that this is a push in 4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|bridge_one: now can discartd a @D|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if opps make 2@D declarer is down, so musty play for A in @D in East|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bridge_one: if now East play small @D you must play the K !|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|cuttysark: still rather pushy - if Dbl from South would be game try here 3@S is simply competing |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|wilkinsona: to be fair its there on the spade break..|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Still, the North had does look rather tasty for spades|pg||

nt|sharkey: That I agree with - I wud PASS|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true|pg||
nt|henryb:  I don't see any sensible way to reach spades after 1@d opening|pg||
nt|sharkey: fast:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say your partner tried to reopen then comfortably could bid spades/prev deal|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It will be interesting to see which side buys the contract here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  playing J @h is not good - after seeing partner overruffed  @h 6 with the king|pg||
nt|daman: 5-3 after 8 boards|pg||
nt|daman: like watching paint dry|pg||
mb|3H|nt|daman: could use a few action hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: another 4@H contract   |pg||
nt|cuttysark: 4@S is the best contract for EW, but hard to reach now|pg||
nt|cuttysark: SOuth will raise to 4@H and West will - have a think |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 72 imps wit how many boards to go i think we are in concession territory|pg||
mb|d|nt|garnetts: easier when North does not open 1NT |pg||
nt|sharkey: yes when pd has 4@S - or 2@C....|pg||
nt|daman: this isn't one of them|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ady: 3@D    bergen?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am guessing this is a Minisplinter - raise to 3@H with a singleotn diamond|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: A North who opens 1NT with a 5card Major - I approve, but not all will agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I am sure I would have bid over 4NT - no-one is going to double 5@C when my suit is as good as this|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cuttysark: But I have guessed wrong - it is a raise to 3@H with 3card support|pg||
nt|ady: can make 12 tricks |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ralfwil: agree George - next board!|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry brain death contagious 82|pg||
pc|hA|nt|garnetts: I am ambivalent about that treatment--I prefer 1@S and then jumping to 3@H |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|cuttysark: She must finesse @H10 to make this. Diamonds are too slow|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sharkey: On Bd 7 when 5@C showed 1 or 4 - with 0 Key Cards they wud have been in slam as compelled to bid 5@D?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: thx specs for showing up my arithmetic for hat it is plain innumeracyh|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cuttysark: Most 5card major players settle for the 8card fit they know rather than venture into the unknown|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|nt|cuttysark: Or she might persuade West to try to cash out against KQ doubleton :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||

nt|jbgood: somebody should have pushed to avoid the push:)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|cuttysark: Our scorecard is wrong because 4@H has been entered wrongly as played by North - it really is 12 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 2@D is a weak 2-suiter in the majors. Ugh!|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|wilkinsona: well, trying to stop 3N by EW|pg||
nt|bridge_one: switching Q@D at second trick|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I suppose 2@S was asking for a stopper - quite brave with that hand|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well coped with by the Welsh|pg||
nt|rmb1: Rarely do you see such a lack of intermediates as North's heart suit|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cuttysark: Another fine contract - even I could make this :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: a straight flush is also rare|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|bridge_one: 3Nt seam impossible to lose here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|iain sime: I think the north hand is closer to a weak two spades. |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rmb1: Two straight flushes including @HA2345|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bg: 2 dia probably not game forcing would be in standard 2/1 style|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes it is gf in 2/1 |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D with passed hand ...|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|vugraphzhb: sorry misclick.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cuttysark: The hearts are solid, to be fair - but I could live without mentioning them|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: have to make the decisions re how to treat passed hand bids |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d3|nt|bridge_one: this of passed hand is a old question - many don't use drury for this reason, because they prefere 2@C natural after passed hand to play|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jbgood: a heart ruff high, spade to hand and heart and spade would have made life difficult for S|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|wilkinsona: might steel the oppos suit..I think its a good tactical try|pg||
nt|iain sime: But, maybe if they had reached 6D the ekrens would have worked, declarer playing South for a singleton heart honour.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bridge_one: declarer is playing all chances |pg||
pc|h2|nt|bridge_one: first try @C 3/3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h3|pc|s9|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  yes, margin is very narrow - each trick matters|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Reese gained 6imps on board 8 by playing in 3@H 2 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: south likely to pre-emp after east opens|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sorry - Reess, not the late great JTR|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3@S seems enough|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree with them to some extent but still think 1@S was better on this hand with such good spades |pg||
mb|4S|nt|sharkey: 3 NT - coffee hand.....|pg||
nt|xenya: 7-5 -- what do you do with the S hand?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: can you imagine   in the CR    West doubled 4@S    she must have thought it was Christmas    |pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: West would prefer a re-opening double here - but generally unwise with a void in their suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@s not quite on!|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cuttysark: Many I know would bid 4@S, despite the vulnerability - here it does not matter since partner is going to raise|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@s perhaps. no preempt in this position|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it should have been t least easter for one off|pg||
nt|xenya: so far identical to the CR|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: easy enough for north to raise to game   3@S Vul should be a dececent suit|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: as soon as north shows some values i think south will go for game|pg||
nt|xenya: both S's being sneaky|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: in fact even quicker than in cloased|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think i would have made a stronger bid as west she doesnt need pard to have much for slam to be on|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: 4@C splinter, perhaps|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cuttysark: 3card support, 3Quick Tricks - what more coul one desire?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well should lose 2 spades 2 dims in theory|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course pard hasnt got much here so its academic|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not much scope for a swin here - someone may gain an imp by picking up trump for no loser|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|daman: wow  in the CR     East did not split on a low @D lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: at least Mike|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sharkey: agree Mike - doesnt cost to show your hand|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||
nt|lestergold: nor here|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|sT|nt|lestergold: maybe a laZY DESPONDANT BID OF 4@S|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: 14 imps expensive|pg||
nt|xenya: now it does look like 1 off -- and a huge pickup for the leaders|pg||
nt|daman: but in the CR     when the @D play happened   declarer had no way back to dummy|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: I SUPPOSE THEY MUST ALL BE VERY TIRED WHEEL OUT THE OLD EXCUSE ETC|pg||
nt|lestergold: sory caps lock horror|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Swapped keyboards with Geoffrey?|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s going off is surprising|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sharkey: This is the 2nd of three 20 board segments so a long way to go in this match|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|sharkey: see only 9 tricks...|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the south spazde holding looiksm like promoting to two tricks if all the clubs are ruffed|pg||
nt|lestergold: was this makeable?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: the line taken here is very similar to the other room, except that South led @DJ after the ruff of @HQ|pg||

nt|toobad: 2|pg||
nt|rmb1: Did not cash @HK ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: no|pg||
nt|toobad: it appears not|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|rmb1: West is unlucky that East's only source of tricks is opposite West's singleton|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jbgood: East is also unlucky...|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jbgood: amusing!|pg||
nt|toobad: i think w has forgotten the system|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|iain sime: Twelve tricks if you pick up hearts. Five diamonds, a ruff, two aces and four hearts.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: I was about to say that there is nothing on their card about 3M responses to 2NT=minors but I suspect a big wheel has come off|pg||
nt|jbgood: one is playing 2 NT weak in minors - the other is playing 2 NT strong!:)|pg||
nt|toobad: n can taste the blood already|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: i'm not sure W reaslises its for the minors|pg||
nt|toobad: 7s is a cert|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I was wondering how you expected anyone to bid it :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: you folk are on 2 different hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: quietly conservative|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: director just being called|pg||
nt|rmb1: In which case 5@C = 3 of 5 key cards.  Has south guessed what is going on?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: before final pass|pg||
nt|jbgood: finally a double - from S even!|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: believe heard something from the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|jbgood: W thinking about a xx|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cuttysark: 2@D looks like game-forcing checkback|pg||
nt|jbgood: oh - off the hook - amazing|pg||
nt|toobad: ben was just trying to wind us up lol|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|cuttysark: Followed by 3@S to show the 6card suit|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cuttysark: Playing 5card majors South had alrady shown 5, so 2@H would promise a 6th heart|pg||
nt|iain sime: Yes. South's raise to game in a sequence which invited cue bidding persuaded North that 4S was enough.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bg: now 2 clubs by non passed hand obviously not GF|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bridge_one: this hand is interesting bec 2@C is old natural style (no GF, like 2/1)|pg||
nt|rmb1: Ben: was the double a mistake on your part or was it removed by TD?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|nt|bridge_one: Yes Bruce :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but with passed hand you are sure about the UP limit|pg||
nt|bg: they are using the acol base not 2/1|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, i know|pg||
pc|h6|nt|wilkinsona: does the duck not risk a diamond ruff?|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|jbgood: no need to do that - we get enough exitement from the real bidding:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: double was misclick|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bridge_one: i told they play 4 cards majors|pg||
nt|bridge_one: natural style|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bridge_one: and i love this way to play (also 2@D multi and 2Maj=costrunctive 8/11)|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||

nt|vugraphzhb: Just there.]|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bridge_one: can make without problems playing @S ruff, @h ruff|pg||
pc|s9|nt|iain sime: We can see that there was no diamond ruff, but declarer had to duck the first club to get her ruff. ok now.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, but winning then drawing trump risks 2 club losers|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: right..|pg||
pc|d8|nt|wilkinsona: ..so well done..|pg||

nt|jbgood: 3 imps in when you have a telephone number..|pg||

nt|daman: same here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cuttysark: And another slam - 3 already in this set|pg||

mb|2D|nt|lestergold: ditto|pg||
nt|ralfwil: D for me|pg||
nt|daman: my Mother would double|pg||
nt|lestergold: u overcll first with this shape and later you probably make takeout double|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3N|nt|sharkey: West's Michael bid in principle shud show 5-5 in Majors|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The hand is strong enough to D and after that @h|pg||
nt|xenya: i can double later if needed|pg||
nt|daman: I disagree Ralf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a style of bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is a standard hand as recommended by Robert Owen in doubles for takeout penalties and profits|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: For me is a second double weaker thah this hand|pg||
nt|daman: if I double and bid a suit     I would have a stronger hand|pg||
mb|p|pc|c9|nt|ady: south should transfer  and pass at 2@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and BBO has a great service to compare. Here it is : http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph_archives/vugraph_archives.php?command=all|pg||
nt|jcwla: Do you prefer 3@S or 4@H?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think 4@H does not get the hand over, but am not keen on the splinter with the singleton king|pg||
nt|cuttysark: SO don't really like either, but you have to pick one!|pg||
nt|lestergold: what!?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: Has Catherine taken leave orf her senses|pg||
pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: another great service is : http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   you can watch all rooms in same time|pg||
nt|jcwla: Bergen advocates splintering even with stiff A or K - many disagree.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North now committed to slam, hoping there are not 2 spade losers|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, N might have investigated with 5@D, but would have had a lot of company with 4NT and the no-2-losers wish has been granted.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anyone for a 2@H rebid rather than 2@d?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It depends on what you expect for 4@C |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has @SKxx and a club filler|pg||
nt|lestergold: at tbhese colours and at this stage of the match she should quietly defend 4@h not likely to gain much sacking here|pg||
nt|sharkey: this turns out to be a great bid I think|pg||
nt|lestergold: could be more of a disaster than it is|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: declarer needs to take care   if hearts are 4-1   might get tapped out with club lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like this may be off 2 |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I vote for 2@h |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Question of style - but the suit strength would persuade me towards 2@H|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me strong enough and why not 1@s from S over 1@d?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cuttysark: Again, she is establishing diamonds before drawing trump - cannot afford to lose control of the trump suit when they can force dummy to ruff clubs|pg||
nt|sharkey: off 1 now |pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|cuttysark: Maybe we should unblock @HK before ducking the diamond|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|sharkey: W wud have to shift to low @D 2nd trick for a @S thru - later S wud finesse for @D Q.....|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cuttysark: And we might discard @CK instead of ruffing the spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS are having a good set so far. North knows they can't have lost much, if any (in fact they have several sizeable gains)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|sQ|nt|sharkey: for down 2|pg||
nt|sharkey: can still get it if finesse|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sharkey: S had the opportunity to ditch a @S on @CK when in dummy|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as for me, if "normal" 1NT is limited to 11 points, I wouldn't hope for game and look for better partscore|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But all wil be well|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so 2@h looks better, but it's definitely matter of style|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Reess team gaining a number of small swings |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Agreed - it does not look like a game hand, and no point in stretching nonvulnerable|pg||

pc|h5|nt|cuttysark: But if the East and West hands had been swopped she might make game!|pg||
nt|ady: with the hands so generally balanced  alwaays going to get home|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Lucky there is no diamond ruff now|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d8|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West sees no future anywhere else, so tries the ruff and discard - but declarer's trump are too good|pg||

nt|vugraphzhb: South and west were waiting for East to bid then.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|cuttysark: Not sure whether the other table started with 11 & 12 - matches cut to 24 boards because the Irish had to come by ferry - or are just rather slow|pg||
nt|iain sime: The actual score is 24-1, Wales winning their first imp of the event on hand 5.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|wilkinsona: did well to catch a ferry I woud say..|pg||
nt|iain sime: Scotland won 12 on hand 4 instead of 11 per the scorecard, and were 11-0 up after two hands.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They did very well - both the Northern Irish and the Ireland team managed to make alternative travel arrangements at short notice|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...usual travel is ryanair and they have packed in to monday|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|jbgood: nice try from E|pg||
nt|jbgood: but a spade ruff kills the slam|pg||
mb|5H|nt|rmb1: 6@H is delicate, only any good because of @HQJ doubleton|pg||
nt|jbgood: no good lam for sure|pg||
nt|jbgood: slam|pg||

nt|bg: EBU now on the board!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this counterplay happen more frequently you can think open Nt with 6 card in minor|pg||
nt|jbgood: E takes charge.. no need to consult prd|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|iain sime: West should probably have doubled 3H and got their side to an unmakeable 5C.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||

nt|sharkey: double dummy - perhaps|pg||
nt|jcwla: Auction might go P-P-1@S-X-2@S-P-P-X-P-2NT (scrambling)-P-3@C-all pass.  Or W might start with XX (or X later to show a max), or E might raise @S to the level of the fit.  Lots of ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: options.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well tjis could be a firwroks hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: i beg to differ i think 4@s atrocious|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: 6@S reached on board 8 in CR|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however given layout chances are not bright|pg||
nt|daman: it has potential|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D|nt|sharkey: NS likely to get to 4@H - EW can sac in 5@D|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sfoxa:  I think, if you play 2NT strong, W hand is worth this opening. 1@s may face pass, and for game forcing - not enough a little bit|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sharkey: for off 3|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate not coffee break time for sure|pg||
nt|daman: unh unh|pg||
nt|xenya: what does N feel now, seeing the 1@H bid?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h at this stage|pg||
nt|daman: warm and fuzzy|pg||
nt|lestergold: but that will not end auction|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you all bid 1@h on S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|xenya: i do|pg||
nt|daman: oui|pg||
nt|daman: 4NT should show long @Ds with secondary @Cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: West missed her chance to bid @D|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but this tiem, E has normal response|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another example of the 'do you open NT with a 5card major?' question|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: brave overcall in the sandwich position |pg||
nt|h_karluk: counting nine on C suit twice finesse - no reason|pg||
nt|mdgraham: threatening lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I would be quite worried if it wne t 1@S All Pass, so put me down for 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Well. you got close|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkey: S cud also be 6-5 - if @C10 instead of x wud be off 1|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: e/w likely to get too high|pg||
nt|garnetts: this looks like one down |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks as if West will just ahve to pass and hope for the best|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, sorry, they are in 4@S - thought it was 3NT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Those playing 5card Stayman would reach 4@S even after opening 2NT|pg||
pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: that helps to pitch any loser of doubletons, so one gets 12 tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with open cards you can mahe 6@d!|pg||
nt|daman: they are in 6@D doubled in the CR|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry make|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|ady: last chance of a plus for e/w was to pass 3@HX    not easy|pg||
pc|cT|nt|cuttysark: To me it seems that if East had enough for game opposite this hand she would have reopened eith 3@H rather than double - but it is a question of partneship style|pg||
nt|ady: west has run    and is right  3NT  expensive    4 clubs down 1|pg||
nt|garnetts: that will not get doubled |pg||
nt|garnetts: would have better off letting them be in 3NT |pg||
nt|cuttysark: She had 7 tricks in 3NT, so only 2 down :)|pg||
nt|ady: 3 hearts should be down 1    but very difficult to pass the double for west|pg||
nt|sharkey: easy game Hamid :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: NS have 27 HCP one would buy 3N but who|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|garnetts: maybe that is why it is better to pass than to open with that hand |pg||
nt|lestergold: saving at equal vul you need to be confident that your side can make a lot of tricks- the hand was very dabgerous|pg||
nt|sharkey: Double score to Levy team I think - a little too late|pg||
nt|lestergold: ur asset was a 4333 hand with a king an umpteen loswr hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: under the circumstances - being up a bundle - I agree Mike|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sfoxa:  this game is easier - no need to gues @h, just establish @d |pg||
pc|h3|nt|garnetts: KQ stiif not that good and the clubs are just so so |pg||
nt|sharkey: Perhaps East shud have raised @D?|pg||
nt|jcwla: I think many would feel this too strong for 2@S in third white on red.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think I would have bid 3@C rather than 2@S to indicate that I had opened with 6 clubs and a poor hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to show lead|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|cuttysark: Defenders can get a ruff, but with a trump trick, and no communication for any further ruffs|pg||
pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: in case N buys|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It's a question of style|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: use all entries to finess in @s|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sharkey: sry - double score to Reess team|pg||
pc|d7|nt|daman: double finesse|pg||
nt|daman: anti percentage|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cuttysark: As is the double with only 3 hearts - some would prefer to overcall|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|3S|nt|cuttysark: Very strange result on Board 6 where the Welsh reached 3NT, got a spade lead, and somehow contrived to go down - wonder if it is accurate|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Giorgio and Bruce my co commentators |pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to our specs,  great comments !  I enjoy the humor |pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl with 4@H is obvious|pg||

mb|p!|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iain sime: Another ten imps to Scotland. Wales had nine top tricks in 3NT in the other room, but decided to play for overtricks on the premise that our ladies could not possibly find a heart ...|pg||
nt|iain sime: switch!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@C means weak hand long @C - no forcing|pg||
nt|bridge_one: different from 2/1|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|iain sime: West pitched a diamond on the third heart, which saved a mis-guess.|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: director as exposed card|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Most players play that a king lead asks partner to unblock an honour: they would know that North had AJ so would find a switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzhb: club played and diamond exposed|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Compulsory to call the director, though it does not look as if the exposed card will affect the outcome|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cuttysark: Another good board for the Scots, who have great results in both rooms|pg||
