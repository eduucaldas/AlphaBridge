mb|2D!|mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: You could bid 2@D now to show a good raise. However, as you don't want to be in game opposite a passed hand, 2@S is better in my opinion|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Takes more room away|pg||
nt|heatherd: 3@d by Symons might have made life more difficult for Moore if that showed a 4-card raise|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: yep |pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: Good morning all.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|justin c: cue bid then @D from W to show a serious raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: Do people prefer dble from the E hand here?|pg||
nt|justin c: prefer 1@D myself|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed just avoid the 3nt trap is the name of the game here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: no show the suit is right|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzha: 2@D might only be 3 as 1NT was forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: can you in Europe see the ash in clouds? |pg||
nt|vugraphzha: seems a beautiful clear day here actually|pg||
nt|justin c: easy to see a X getting into trouble|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: how does dble get into trouble?|pg||
nt|justin c: W might cue 2@C and continue with @H|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4C|nt|sybarra: had friends in Europe saying similar,  didnt see "bad"" |pg||
nt|vugraphzha: quite rare for manchester|pg||
nt|sybarra: *didnt seem  |pg||
nt|justin c: this 3@D bid is a bit obscure|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D looks the spot on the bidding to date|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make up to 3@C    n/s  can compet in spades  and may make 9 tricks unless defence can take 2 diamond tricks before hearts are established for a pitch of a diamond|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iain sime: 4@C should be one light after a normal spade lead.|pg||
nt|ady: dbl from east sub minimum =  the fashion now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lark20: she will always do this especially with 5 hearts|pg||
nt|iain sime: Still one light but the defence will have only one more chance to cash two spades.|pg||
nt|ady: dont think that will be too difficult|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 4@H was obscure|pg||

nt|rednaxela: Good morning, Peter.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|heatherd: Good slam here|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: Symons has the 1827:1 against hand, a Yarborough, no card higher than a nine|pg||
nt|heatherd: Goodish anyway|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The chance of having a hand with no card higher than a nine spot has been mathematically equated to 1827:1|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Is there a name for a hand without even a 9?  And what are the odds, Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Search me|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pitiful:  West has a tough bid in their methods assuming 2@c was not FG|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: term is derived from Lord Yarborough of England, who offered a wager with odds of 1,000 pounds to one against the chance of any player having such a holding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He must have made a fortune|pg||
nt|heatherd: If she's in slam she can make it by drawing 2 rounds of trumps and ruffing the 4th diamond in the dummy.|pg||
nt|rednaxela: It has been suggested to me that it is called a Carte Blanche.|pg||
mb|p|nt|heatherd: If @ds are 3-3 you won't ruff the 4th one, you just draw trumps|pg||

pc|cA|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Steve Eginton says: I can't find an 8 high, but 5432 (any) 432,432,432 is 158,753,389,899 to 1|pg||

nt|Walddk2: From BBO's Department of Useless Information|pg||
mc|12|nt|heatherd: or the squeeze, but she could have combined them. Never mind she was only in 4|pg||
pg||
qx|c22|st||md|4S6H972D9832C98643,SKQ5HAK5DAQ5CJT75,SJT9842H83DJTCAQ2,SA73HQJT64DK764CK|sv|e|nt|Walddk7: Due to travel difficulties (vulcano ash   closed airspace), the weekend has been shortened to just Saturday and Sunday with 12 boards per segment (rather than 16). No bridge Friday ...|pg||
nt|Walddk7: because the Irish teams were stranded on the island|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess at the auction is 1 s-p 2c-2 ht 2 nt p 3 nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup welsh gold to the fore|pg||
nt|iain sime: 3@S was makeable, so this was as good a result as Scotland could get (apart from an unrealistic pass by Sam in 4th seat).|pg||
nt|ady: slam time|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ady: there are only 11 obvious tricks in hearts  but 2 ways to make the 12th|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: messy hand this|pg||
nt|vugraphzha: 2@C is nat GF|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@H is where you want to land|pg||
nt|roswolf: but could/should be defeated if played by east|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: rebid of the spade suit by W?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  or kind of invite?|pg||
nt|justin c: seems inevitable|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: ruff finesse the Q@C works   also pull 2 trumps only and play diamonds hoping if they are 4-2  the hand with 4 diamonds has the outstranding trump|pg||
nt|iain sime: Both pairs play weak NT and weak twos in the majors. NS also play five card majors and a short club.|pg||
nt|ady: may also play a minor suit squeeze which fails|pg||
nt|lark20: 2NT is Baron 15+ showing 3/4 card support|pg||
nt|iain sime: Can probably beat game by defending here. |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sybarra: or just bid game  LOL|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  straight to game - good vulnerable approach in match|pg||
nt|ady: singleton spade lead kills the line of drawing 2 trumps only and playing 4 rounds of diamonds as it works up to then  but no quick way back to hand to draw the last trump and north ...|pg||
nt|ady: can win A@C and give a spade ruff|pg||
mb|6N|nt|sybarra: will be disappointed to only take 4 sp tricks |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|justin c: 2@C was GF by the looks of this|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|iain sime: This may not be best. There are eleven tricks and provided South hangs on to her diamonds England have won 13 imps.|pg||
nt|ady: no way to get the 12th trick here    other than 3-3 diamond break  or an unlikely squeeze position in in clubs and diamonds|pg||
nt|lark20: In a heart contract, could always take a ruffing finesse in clubs|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  interesting position in @d|pg||
nt|iain sime: My guess is that Sam placed the @S ace with North and wanted to declare with @SKQx.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lark20: Presumably she chose 6NT to protect her spades|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sfoxa:  @d K will block the suit for a while|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S has to duck next @c|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|roswolf: has to be otherwise east was overbidding wildly - she only has a 9 count after all|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h5|pc|sT|pc|hT|pc|h9|pg||
nt|sybarra: will do since N will win club with q |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lark20: Sorry Ian both saying the same, but I am slower|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|sybarra: and beginning to give S a bit of a problem |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ouch!|pg||
nt|sybarra: now has to figure it out for the up trick |pg||
nt|justin c: & west underbidding even more wildly|pg||

pc|sA|pc|c4|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|justin c: cant see how to get to hearts by west|pg||
nt|iain sime: Always a treat to have someone even aslower than me on the team :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|sybarra: tricks to burn now |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: England played in a safe 4 hearts making 6 in closed room  and will be please when they compare as it is possible Scotland could have bid and made 6@H|pg||
nt|iain sime: North has pitched spades in suit preference order to show clubs, but South knew to hold diamonds from looking at dummy.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|s7|pc|c8|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c2|pc|dK|mc|11|nt|ady: had South had Queen of clubs at this point the slam would have made|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|rednaxela: Good news for England.  Can't see that getting through.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|heatherd: But North will be nervous when she sees dummy!|pg||
nt|heatherd: 2@s or just show a @h raise?|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|pitiful:  need to stop low here|pg||
nt|heatherd: @h raise. The @s suit is rather poor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ed Jones: not especially hard to work out - no card higher than an 8 is 16960 to 1 :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  most points in the other suits|pg||
nt|heatherd: The cards are not at all favourable|pg||
nt|pitiful:  so 2@s misguided imo|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N!|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|heatherd: This may go 2 or 3 down|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well this looks bad but on a good day...|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Anyone who makes a contract here isn't bidding enough.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i think it is possible to stop in 2@h|pg||
nt|pitiful:  drury response and 2@h weakest bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: 3NT was 11-14 or 18/19 bal|pg||
nt|heatherd: Swap the defence's cards around and you make 4@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2010January-July/LadyMilne/results.htm  for results and standings after round 2|pg||
nt|heatherd: @d lead is the only one not to give a trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: S giving the lead a lot of thought|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well for some players, tony forrester for example, @d would be the only lead|pg||
pc|d6|nt|heatherd: Still no result from the 6NT|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|ady: North should have kept an extra spade and 1 less club in the 4 card ending|pg||
mb|1H|nt|iain sime: A vulnerable psyche!|pg||
nt|lark20: That is a weak opening bid especially Vulnerable|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sybarra: S may have thought keeping the @D's was better |pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: this might get feisty|pg||
nt|ady: how high will south go?|pg||

nt|sybarra: the East hand raised to 3 |pg||
nt|roswolf: the club 6 is a great card for declarer|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzha: raising to 3 seems a bit unlucky none of her Qs working and p having so much in @Cs|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||
nt|iain sime: South has respected her partner's pass- or seen her openers before. |pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: this should be 2 down in 3 to flaten the result in OR where England were way too high|pg||
nt|lark20: I suppose she did limit her hand with the 2NT bid|pg||

pc|h5|nt|justin c: for a 3 imp gain to england|pg||
