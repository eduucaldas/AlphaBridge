nt|ralfwil: Sometimes you are outbidden, but shouldn´t W act?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: When in doubt - bid. Good motto|pg||
nt|fann4: It's close, but the lack of a 4th @H and the @SA suggests no.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|fann4: But those who don't like to be stolen from....|pg||
nt|szalay: btw I think East could pass 4@Sx...but 300 is better than 100, anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @SA is a good card, then partner does not have wasted values there|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|fann4: Everyone agree with the take out dbl here?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks for me like a sharp limit raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Another question of style - I do not like to double with 5-5 distribution|pg||
nt|josj: nope|pg||
nt|fann4: Me neither|pg||
nt|josj: looks like a hand for Ghestem or so|pg||

nt|ralfwil: no D for me as E. a @s overcall|pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|cuttysark: Partner is never going to bid one of your 5card suits, so you have used up a round of bidding wityhout describing your hand|pg||
nt|fann4: It seems a lot of the French don't play Ghestem either - with apologies to the late Pierre Ghestem.|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Where South did overcall 1NT - pushed EW into 5@C and his side into 5@H. Bit of a contrast|pg||
nt|fann4: W must just pitch and he will get a trump trick surely.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Chemla doubled 4@S in the other room and Levy took out into 5@H|pg||

nt|szalay: I think vulnerabilty (and state of the match) is more crucial than 1st or 2nd hand status|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes - but still conservative :)|pg||

mc|10|nt|othered1: doesn't work, since you need to keep north off lead, and can't.|pg||
nt|sybarra: says 2 of 3,  with this kind of lead do you play last set? (if it doesnt get closer) |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|szalay: I think to pass 2@S in NV is an option|pg||

nt|fann4: I think so:)|pg||
nt|szalay: yes, probably N-S weren't in their best concentration (like me:)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|fann4: 13 imps to STRETZ, but too little, too late. (barring something freaky)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like EW can make 4@h|pg||
nt|szalay: why not staright 4@H now?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fann4: Dbl by N here played a take out|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Presumably 2@H is hearts and a minor, and he has poor support for clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|szalay: but if u r far behind, their red (vulnerable) is time for agression|pg||
nt|szalay: does it matter we lose by 30 or 100?|pg||
nt|fann4: This needs the standard @H lead to beat it.|pg||
nt|szalay: we need miracles...and as u know: its Easter, time of miracles|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: agree with 4@h from E|pg||

nt|szalay: like in 800m track|pg||
nt|josj: I can imagine :)|pg||
nt|szalay: who comes second for last 100 meters, often wins|pg||
