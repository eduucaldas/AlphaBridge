nt|ady: this seems a bidable slam|pg||
nt|snorris: another 9 tricks @s contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Leading to 3NT without any entry in your hand, from KQ9xxx low is usually best, from KQ10xxx high (king) is usually best|pg||
mb|1C|nt|benjent: Another 3NT for EW ... but NS still have some bidding to do|pg||
nt|bg: another one here where 3 is the limit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: opportunity for GT here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzgp: Corrected sorry|pg||
nt|benjent: What do you open with the North hand Peter?|pg||
nt|april7: 1@H 1@S 2NT and then slamtry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 0-4 with 4 spades probably|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ady: red suits splitting nicely  n/s have 12 tricks in either red suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  will N ever be able to show his @d holding?|pg||
nt|ady: may be difficult to reach|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: key is the quality of east's doubleton spade backing up the 6 card suit|pg||
nt|snorris: should pass ..too many loosers|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, if that's a 3@S bid, North had better be careful |pg||
mb|3D|nt|petergill: 1@S or 1@D = a matter for each partnership to decide. In the olden days, people used to pass the North cards, but not many exeptrts do that nowadays|pg||
nt|petergill: I open 1@D, unless my partnership style and agreement demands that I open 1@S|pg||
nt|petergill: and you, Ben?|pg||
nt|benjent: I think 1@d for me. With 5@h and a long minor, I like to get the major on the table, but I always feel with @s I'm the boss of the auction |pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT on the West cards is normal. You just hope (expect?) that partner will have the side suits under control, or that there will be a blockage or wrong defence|pg||
nt|benjent: Mostly, I would like to open the one partner has the best fit for, but that's not so easy to arrange :)|pg||
nt|petergill: True|pg||
nt|petergill: The play is very awkward|pg||
nt|benjent: There's was blockage on the last hand, and there's a distinct lack of defensive communication on this hand too|pg||
nt|petergill: @H6 likely to be 4th best, so @H8 will win|pg||
nt|april7: whats wrong with the 2NT bid?|pg||
nt|bg: tough to resist bidding 4;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: agree|pg||
nt|snorris: 17hp|pg||
nt|snorris: 18 rather|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I don't think you *must* bid with 10 losers|pg||
mb|3S|nt|benjent: Declarer can place the key cards right now|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer is planning what to do after that|pg||
nt|andyv:  problem with @d opener in precision.... just too difficult to describe this hand...N could have bid 2@d and then shown @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: seems like reopening X is taken at full value by E|pg||
nt|joest: 4@h is a tad pushy|pg||
nt|petergill: Entries to dummy are in short supply|pg||
nt|benjent: The @h lead irritatingly takes out his entry to the board|pg||
nt|benjent: Various endplay possibilities ... declarer will spend some time working his way through them|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H seems rushing the auction and does north have to have 5 hearts?|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe 2@h showed 5@h and as long or longer @ds?|pg||
nt|mamos:  artificiality seems to be getting in the way here|pg||
mb|4C|nt|petergill: South known to have @HKJ, so North must have @SQ, @CK and @DA for the opening bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  otherwise, bid doesn't make sense (why wouldn't N open 1@h?)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT takes up too much bidding room, Avram. 2@C is more economical in order to explore further|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Believe me, Gazzilli is worth learning|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  this is better than in the OR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Everything Garozzo has been involved in is worth learning|pg||
pc|d2|nt|joest: if I was west and heard partner bid 4@h i'd be disappointed to go down :)|pg||
nt|benjent: Interest @d pitch ... I'd be thinking North is 5053 as a working plan |pg||
pc|d3|nt|cicus: usual procedure is allow some leeway and let doubler do the pushing|pg||
nt|ady: even adfter 2NT re-bid  some difficulty   east could have had a number of other cards and not J@S|pg||
pc|dT|nt|petergill: North covering with @SQ suggests North has @S9 - with @SQ7xxx North might duck @SJ, in case declarer has 5 spades|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|rhelle: conventional wisdowm is to play partner for around 7 points|pg||
nt|mamos:  look like they will bid now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: When you have the boss suit, you may get a chance to compete later|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|joest: intrafinesse the heart?|pg||
nt|benjent: The @s pitch is ok for East ... now he can cash @s's|pg||
nt|petergill: Good club switch, having worked out that East is 4441|pg||
pc|h6|nt|benjent: Yes, prematurely killed one of East's endplay options (play @cA and another one late in the game)|pg||
nt|benjent: East should cash @hA at his next chance - put the squeeze on a very uncomfortable North|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rhelle: East has even less than that, so he has no reason to bid 4@h, IMHO|pg||
nt|rhelle: oh yes - very nice|pg||
nt|cicus: kibs also suggested this play|pg||
nt|joest: plus the spades lie nicely so he can roll this home|pg||
nt|rhelle: of course, seeing North have AK of D pinpoints the other honours|pg||
nt|joest: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: and N is likely to have 2 hearts rather than 3, so the intrafinesse seems indicated|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm still impressed with the speed at which he found it - not an everyday play|pg||
pc|hK|nt|joest: a play first made famous by Gabriel Chagas in a BOLS bridge tip about 25 years ago|pg||
nt|ady: north opened 1@H CR and later bid diamonds twice|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Note that surnames are not used much in Iceland. However, you can see them in the player profiles|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How would you bid to this excellent slam after a 2NT rebid?|pg||
nt|ady: safest contract is 6NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: EW had the same method available in the other room but stopped short anyway|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c4|pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|rhelle: well done|pg||
nt|rhelle: well, if you bid like that you've got to play very well|pg||
nt|joest: with all three spade honors in the slot it turns out there is no guess|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C opening and 2NT (jump)rebid are hopeless in a natural system|pg||
nt|mamos:  well i know the value of gazzilli but after 2Nt I'd bid 3@S which for me would be forcing|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|ady: after 2NT rebid  3@S ok if forcing   otherwise 3@D then 3@H   and then 3@S?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|joest: welldone indeed|pg||
nt|benjent: watching carefully ... :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: It should be, yes Mike, but does it promise six cards?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|kareno: Can someone explain where we are in terms of this Trials?  Is it a Senior Trials?  (Paul Lavings is no youngster I know).|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: normal Pass- not allerted|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: this is almost a record number of calls to reach a final contract of 1H|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone notice the fantasy in the OR?  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: talk about value for money|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: was commented at table aswell|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|kareno: Comes of opening that collection of tram tickets by west (or at least east not respecting a minimum opening possibility)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kareno: I'm told, state team selection, paul about 63, this is 'open'|pg||

nt|benjent: North could have done a bit better by putting the @dJ on the 10, rather than taking the A|pg||
nt|benjent: snap|pg||
nt|andyv:  would seem to be an easier way to handle this hand|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20 |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It could be a fiver looking for three-card support|pg||
mb|1H|nt|petergill: East's good play was as is expected of a member of the Iceland National Open Team p|pg||
nt|bg: 3 spades is the correct Bergen call with 4 trumps and a very weak holding N had 5 losers no guarantee that siouth would cover two of them|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: good save found in CR|pg||
nt|cicus: W might easily make a mighty leap here|pg||
nt|ady: e/w may buy the contract in a part score in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not sure I understand the auction in the closed room|pg||
mb|1S|nt|benjent: Could North have figured declarer would have tried @c10 if he had a 2nd @c? Then he might have figured out the 4441|pg||
nt|petergill: NS with 25 HCP cannot make 3Nt but might make an unlikely-to-be-reached 5@D|pg||
nt|ady: 1@D by west shows 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|mamos:  i think West will take control  18-19 opposite good six carder 14 points|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do you want to be in it opposite  xx  in spades?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This was not a random doubleton|pg||
nt|april7: a weak 2 opener by E might have helped to reach a @D sacrifice bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S by West???|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4NT by South??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With all those defensive values|pg||
nt|snorris: very strange...|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|benjent: Harsh that East has both @d honours|pg||
nt|mamos:  North has a slightly heavy 1Nt but when South bids @h ......  |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: South did well to get our for down 1 in 3@S X in CR   must of got a heart lead    quuen of clubs dropped in 1  and got diamond right|pg||
nt|ady: queen of clubs dropped in 2|pg||
nt|snorris: the east in closed room is a member of the parliament(Althingi) Jón Birkir Jónsson|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there seems to be a strange fascination about doing lots of bidding when holding one king|pg||
nt|snorris: he bid 4 @s with good  result|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|petergill: With a double stopper in hearts and no singletons not void, visualising that 5@d is better than 3NT (due to the weak @D's)  is almost impossible|pg||
nt|petergill: nor voids, I meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: X = GF, by the way|pg||
nt|petergill: the doubler at the other table got a bit lucky that his partner took all the tricks|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|benjent: South bid @c's in his auction, and his partner opened 1@h, so I guess figured the oppos had bid a tight game breaking badly|pg||
nt|ady: this may well go down 1|pg||
nt|april7: played from S only 4 @H so 5@D is enough sacrifice|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: e/w have done well to find their diamond fit   I think a weak 2 by west would have kept east out of the bidding|pg||
nt|april7: on @C lead only 1 down|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: 3@C promised at least 3 cards i think, hence 5@C|pg||
nt|snorris: not that I agree with the bid...far from it|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|rhelle: which means that pass over 5@c = I don't want to go on|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|joest: how to treat north's double is an interesting partnership questoin|pg||
nt|rhelle: now 2 rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|joest: does it guarantee another call?   obviously north-south play that it doesn't|pg||
nt|rhelle: North X = GF, with no specific bid|pg||
nt|cicus: it created a GF so pass over 5@C was forcing|pg||
nt|rhelle: over 5C pass = forcing. Double would mean: I want to go on|pg||
nt|joest: thats true.  forgot that 1@c was forcing, sorry|pg||
nt|cicus: so they play pass/X inversion|pg||
nt|rhelle: they have reversed the meaning of Pass and X in that situation|pg||
nt|rhelle: indeed :)|pg||
nt|cicus: a relatively new concept, spreading rapidly|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rhelle: Yes, it seems to work very well|pg||
nt|joest: Another Eric Rodwell creation|pg||
nt|april7: only @C lead will do the job|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|april7: X forbids @D???|pg||
nt|mamos:  This is perhaps the downside of 1@S|pg||
nt|april7: oh yes sorry|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rhelle: the trouble is that we see these gadgets on display when operated by very fine players|pg||
nt|rhelle: and then it all looks very easy :)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: this play may well help east to play a heart to the king rather than the normal play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Iceland is a strong bridge nation. The proudest moment in Icelandic bridge was obviously in 1991 when the team won the World Championships (Bermuda Bowl) in Yokohama, Japan. The ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: only nation with a 100% record: qualified once and won i|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not bad for a nation with around 310,000 inhabitants|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: we will be back|pg||
nt|mamos:  When I watch bridge from Iceland I'm always impressed by the tough standard|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|april7: should not continue @C, but @D,else it would reveal the Q of trumps|pg||
nt|mamos:  east may perhaps have done that with x|pg||
nt|april7: might reaveal|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d2|nt|april7: W is rhinking wether to ruff and try cashing a @D,|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Magnús wondering if partner could be void in spades (ruffing this trick). Unlikely when he plays the ace|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rhelle: looks South needs to woodenly continue @ss|pg||
nt|xenya: now another spade -- and N's @C9 might come into its own|pg||
nt|rhelle: my kind of defence|pg||
nt|rhelle: he know that the @h Ace (if North has it) can't run away|pg||
nt|rhelle: he also knows that North is relatively balanced|pg||
nt|rhelle: my money is on him playing the @sQ next|pg||
pc|d9|nt|petergill: The play of Bd 1 at the other table bore no resemblance to the play at our table, but the outcome was the same|pg||

nt|april7: S is not foolingaround|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: But he fell from grace, did he not? He should have continued the spade attack|pg||

mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: having a hard time seeing how S could buy this for 2S in other room|pg||
nt|bucheister: but if you redouble and then bid a new suit it must be forcing|pg||
nt|othered1: would you sell to 2@S with the west hand, as in OR?  Would you rebid 2@C?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well i would not majke an insufficient bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: I would rebid 2@d intending to bid 3@c next.|pg||
nt|othered1: Me, too.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bucheister: In modern methods, is double for takeout??|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i think X should be takeout by W, and exactly this hand|pg||
nt|othered1: they can find 500 or so|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: i mean over 2S|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, 3@s was a bit enthusiastic I would say.|pg||
nt|bucheister: yes, me too|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|d7|nt|othered1: How does high @H, pitch @D work here?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S was checkback...checking back if N is deaf|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: rofl|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: tanks and checks EW system card|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe they allow a wide range for that overcall and south felt he had substantial extras?|pg||
nt|othered1: Personally, I like to bid at once preemptively, but pass and come back in wiht good hands in their suit.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what exactly would those extras be? worst possible shape, bad heart holding, diamond king likely ill-placed...|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kareno: I like to bid quickly when it's safe.  And not come back in without a very good reason.|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|s3|pc|dK|pg||

nt|ady: north south stopped low in their 10 card fit   5@D  a good contract|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|rhelle: I think it's always 3 off if he just keeps playing @ss|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Muller waking Rudakov |pg||
nt|andyv:  NS should get to game here|pg||
nt|snorris: precision 2 @cs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: an interesting result from the other room|pg||
pc|h2|nt|benjent: The CR played 2@h by EAST. East responded 1@h to 1@d, which I guess involved some system|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Who took a long time efore passing|pg||
nt|ady: not  easy to reach 5@D   will likely play 3NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: may get a low heart lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|mdgraham: north takes out a take-out double - very sensible|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  why is S so willing to bail out?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  I guess if they were vul they might make more of an effort|pg||
nt|ady: same auction in CR|pg||
nt|ady: surely worth 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|april7: how did they make 6 in CR? double finesse in @C and @H?|pg||
nt|mamos:  might not be everyones weak NT|pg||
nt|ady: no problems here|pg||
nt|april7: and no @S lead?|pg||
nt|bg: NS currently 2nd in Round Robin EW are 6th|pg||
nt|snorris: this is hard to win|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|petergill: Transfer responses to fairly standard 1@C opening|pg||
nt|petergill: if so, 1@S would deny a 4 card major|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: it does|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT min bal, 2@C some form of checkback|pg||
nt|andyv:  they probably play 3@d as GF... so maybe 2N is the best invite they have with this hand|pg||
nt|snorris: thought west would bid 2 @s but no|pg||
nt|bg: more sensible than N in other room|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|ady: North would surely bid on with  ace king ace outside a 5 card diamond suit|pg||
nt|ady: south passed  originally so can hardly be game forcing|pg||
pc|c5|nt|benjent: So the contract and declarer is replicated. How entertaining!|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D might show a minimum, then 2@H = 3 hearts|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|joest: well this lead solvesone problem for declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: South's strong diamond holding over East's likely long @d's suggests a trump lead might be best|pg||
nt|andyv:  true....so your 3@d bid seems pretty automatic|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rhelle: this is good bidding|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bg: should prevail with 8 tricks|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: The two-suited 2@S was no success for the Russians in the closed room, but that does not mean that it is bad. It just led to the wrong contract on this occasion|pg||

mb|3H|nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Icemen love to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: lol!|pg||
nt|joest: east has described his hand quite well|pg||
nt|cicus: he has extras|pg||
nt|rhelle: now Muller will bid 1H, I think|pg||
nt|benjent: Which he would do at that stage with either @cA or @cQ|pg||
nt|snorris: 2 @hs might keep s down to 2 @ss|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: well if Karl now x|pg||
mb|4C|mb|d|nt|rhelle: ah yes, they have reversed the 1H and 1@s bids|pg||
nt|cicus: hopefuly both of them|pg||
nt|petergill: Put your cursor on bids to see what they mean|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  likely to reach 3NT with their 25 hcp    needs some luck which they get|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N will be no problem to EW once @h suit breaks|pg||
nt|ady: looks like a routine 4@S    need to be careful not to get too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: so 1@s = 4+@h and GF|pg||
nt|joest: north has great hearts but lots of strength in the opponents suits|pg||
nt|joest: diamonds being a psuedo-suit :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Yes both know the correct meaning|pg||
nt|mamos:  I dont understand South's 3@C bid in Or  any help?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: I guess one can debate the virtue of that 1@D overcall|pg||
nt|ady: CR played 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: let's see what Rudakov has in mind.  If 4@d invites a save, he'll defend against 4@h.  But if he then saves himself, I'll wonder why he didn't bid 5@d just now|pg||
nt|cicus: or a round before|pg||
nt|benjent: Spread 4@s here, with some shot at an 11 on a squeeze|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|rhelle: Yes, I'm puzzled ... als by 3@s from South. 4@c seems to describe the hand better|pg||
nt|joest: I like 4@c too assuming it doesn't have some meaning we don't know about|pg||
nt|rhelle: true - who knows, maybe 3@s is a transfer to @c|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: I have their system notes in front of me, but this is too detailed |pg||
nt|rhelle: to recap: 1@s showed 4+ @h,and is GF|pg||
nt|joest: now in similar situations do the panelists here play that 4@h is weaker than pass or vice versa?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The good thing about having Muller at the table (other than he is a fine player) is that the operator won't get exhausted because he bids or plays too fast|pg||
nt|rhelle: so the pass over 4@d is 100% forcing and shows extras|pg||
nt|rhelle: actually it's a fine slam if the opps don't cash their aces|pg||
nt|xenya: you may have doubts about thec 1@D overcall, Roland, but you can't deny it has led to an interesting auction|pg||
nt|cicus: I am still of the old school of regarding the immediate bid as weaker|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D = his xxx in spades must be opposite shortage (2 or less cards), so the bid is safer than it might look|pg||
nt|ady: and club suit of course|pg||
nt|april7: true! is 1NT not denying a card @S suit?|pg||
nt|april7: 4card @S suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: think it shows @D and GF|pg||
pc|c7|nt|benjent: I still wouldn't have tried 3@d ... swap the NS @d's|pg||
nt|ady: east wandered in with a collection of jacks and a queen|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: 1@H spades I presume and 1NT denying 3 or 4 spades in a minimum balanced hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: ur right|pg||
nt|mamos:  ty|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ady: north likely to sign  off with moderate spades|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|rhelle: 5@d shows 3 aces|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree, Vladimir, very interesting indeed|pg||
nt|joest: i thought that was the new school :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: of the 5|pg||
nt|cicus: I am not that old Jack|pg||
nt|joest: 4NT must have been something other than RKCB if north is thinking it over|pg||
nt|rhelle: I was young before this auction started|pg||
nt|joest: old school = "when I am weak I pass"|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Earlier today it showed extras and a lack of control in a bid suit|pg||
nt|april7: why then E didn't bid 2@H immediately?|pg||
nt|ady: stopped safely   making 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d3|nt|rhelle: the problem for North is that 1@s showed at least 2 controls - i.e. an ace or 2 kings|pg||
nt|tez: it will be hard to bid 3 nt if south would overcall with 1@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  might also be hard for S to explain to teammates -800|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rhelle: and he simply cannot believe that it is 2 kings|pg||
nt|joest: yet partner signed off over Blackwood.  Who to believe?  Muller A or Muller B?|pg||

nt|andyv:  1@h more of a mp bid I think|pg||
nt|tez: i would|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if this 2@C is the same gadget as we saw yesterday, it is (a) a weak two in diamonds (b) weakish both majors (c) various strong hands |pg||
pc|h6|nt|petergill: 5@C as a save would be 500 or 800. East followed the good principle of not bidding (nor doubling 4@C) when you have nothing|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

mb|1S|nt|joest: now why isn't this diamonds with 0+?|pg||
nt|rhelle: X = 6-8, takeout|pg||

nt|bg: if it goes like other room 3d-4d how many bid 4 hearts?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|snorris: I would ..|pg||
mb|2S|nt|benjent: So Michael assumed you knew the idea, bid accordingly and you had the pleasure of going for the number?|pg||
nt|april7: he is in the laww position with 2@S|pg||
nt|bg: one anyway:)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rhelle: he has another toy he wanted to show us :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jön gave up in the other room. Not obvious to come in, but partner did not punish him. Páll knws that 4@H might be a stretch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jón|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Even I, resistant to change as I am, have been converted (in 2010) to playing these transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: and you just try telling Iceking what he can and what he cannot|pg||
nt|mamos:  NS have broken the law :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: well done n/s    the 1@D opening enabled them to compete over 2@S  |pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: lead a trump?|pg||
nt|benjent: I play them, playing a version of Fantunes, but I don't think they're a great idea in a natural system|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 1@H is often a balanced minimum with 3 hearts|pg||
nt|petergill: No, I had just bid badly (was I used to do), doubling 2@H on my 4225, and he was the one who went minus 800 in 3@DX|pg||
pc|c3|nt|joest: well here's a big swing back and this time I KNOW it's going to the Netherlands! :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm not so sure ... he really should have led a trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even on that lead declarer is in deep trouble|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, this will teach him not to intervene over a stron @c|pg||
nt|xenya: vulnerable|pg||
nt|joest: I think everyone would intervene over a strong club with THIS hand -- to be fair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Dirk should change his explanation over 1NT as "No place to play" :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: same dilemma as yesterday - if he finesses and it loses, he may never see th @s Ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The one with shape bids|pg||
mc|9|nt|ady: can still make even losing a heart ruff as 4th heart will be a discard for a losing club|pg||
nt|april7: on that lead S might go down|pg||
nt|april7: depends how S plays the trump suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: has finger on @D Ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: and a @S|pg||
nt|ady: should go down if playing Ace and another diamond  with a club switch|pg||
nt|april7: ace of @S  @D finesse @H and @H ruff and @C and 4th @H|pg||

nt|marlowepi: yes it is surprising how many nations still do teams trials by qualifying individual pairs|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: actually is Imps scoring for field of 56 pairs... only 2 tables being broadcast|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but apparently it is still qualifying pairs not teams|pg||

nt|xenya: good save in other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Finally, our gratitude to the NBB (Marc van Beijsterveldt) and the sponsor, Hans Melchers, for ensuring that this quality match was brought to BBO. Much appreciated by bridge fans ...|pg||

nt|xenya: same thing might happen here though|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: So for all the people who want to enjoy the lovely scenery may 23rd The Onstein Pinkster Patton|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he had a 100% endplay at that point|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: competition bidding coming up|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|joest: 2@d = multi most likely.  A weak two in either major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt that they will take the save|pg||
nt|joest: I agree Roland. the auction will time out differently|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was different in the other room where West passed initially|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry. W opened -- that will make a difference i think|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, West won't bid anymore after having set out his stall|pg||
nt|joest: and East is most definitely not in save mode|pg||
nt|xenya: but E might?|pg||
nt|rhelle: and East is too balanced with too much defence|pg||
nt|joest: if my partner saved in 5@h I would set him up with a psychiatrist :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Muller is missing a bidding card again he starts to order them|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|tez: 2@h enuf for me|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT?|pg||
nt|ady: distribution hand    very good result for GT in CR|pg||
nt|april7: 5@H only 2 down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT may show clubs|pg||
mb|1D|nt|petergill: For intermedaite players: the declarer play technique of that hand was interesting, the diamonds can wait, try the spades first |pg||
nt|april7: bad X in CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: One sensible option 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: e/w might buy it at the 5 level for _ 300|pg||
nt|ady: -300|pg||
nt|bg: hard to figure how EW only made 5 clubs in other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You make slam if you are in it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer played a heart from hand|pg||
nt|snorris: not a bad slam|pg||
mb|1N|nt|benjent: Slightly nervy in 3NT here as you try to diagnose the @d layout|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|joest: so Netherlands would appear to grab victory here on this last board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Play finished in the closed room but no score entered on board 12|pg||
nt|rhelle: this will be quick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Perhaps one of our spectators was there to see?|pg||
nt|cicus: he hides one before each board to leave himself more time to think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S down 3 undoubled I am told|pg||
nt|rhelle: that another 11|pg||
nt|april7: 5@D now|pg||
nt|ady: south has unravelled his hand well as the bidding went|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: Less nervy 2@d|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D is fairly conservative|pg||
nt|benjent: Some marriages wouldn't survive that bid :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S at the other table would have shown 3 hearts and 6+ @d's|pg||
nt|petergill: which is ideal|pg||
nt|mamos:  and West  has shown good judgement|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: So that's 12 IMPs to Russia|pg||
nt|ady: problem with double   is it is unlikely partner can bid 3NT when that is the right contract|pg||
nt|mamos:  wow EW have taken a different approach in this room|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: Maybe 11, right|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: I am told you are rigth Wald|pg||
nt|ady: fell on their feet|pg||
nt|snorris: they are cue bidding..|pg||
nt|snorris: so..|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petergill: the problem with 11D - 11H - 3@D - 3NT is that you can miss a good 5-3 heart fit (on other layouts)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|april7: good decision by E and S|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H surprising  by East|pg||
nt|april7: the 5@D bid made it happen|pg||
nt|ady: n/s will collect 500 but still lose on the board    |pg||
nt|april7: its the par contract|pg||
pc|c9|nt|benjent: Gazzilli is another pathway to solving these hands|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D - 1@H - 3@D - 3NT I mean|pg||
nt|petergill: East might have underbid to avoid this problem, to leave space to find hearts|pg||
nt|benjent: So 1@d-1@h-2@c if you play it that way (I do), then West does his "ok hand" thing and East can get his hand across|pg||
nt|ady: winning action by e/w was to pass out 5@S    that was difficult|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|ady: 3NT by south is a grey area    could be 16 pts   could be what he has   and could be more than what he has|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|petergill: Still, AKJ10xxx and an ace will be 8 tricks often, so 2@D on such a suit is not my first choice|pg||
nt|april7: oh yes nobody is vuln.!|pg||
nt|april7: only 1 imp difference|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: And 8 to NL here|pg||

nt|vugraphzgp: making it 37-34|pg||
nt|joest: bye all|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: more than 1 imps   5@S passed out 450|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: I like 3@D|pg||

nt|april7: y|pg||
nt|april7: even Qx would be enough but then 5 @S were already to high, it's so close the right decisions to make|pg||

nt|cicus: apology break|pg||
nt|petergill: Those who play 2@D opening as 18-19 balanced can use 1@D - 1@H - 2NT (no longer needed as natural) as the 3@H and 6@D problem hand|pg||

nt|mdgraham: no half-measures for North|pg||
mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|rhelle: because 1H = 11-15, pass can be stronger than normal|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|benjent: Sure, useful method|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: 4@D looks an overbid to me -- W could be weaker i'm sure|pg||
nt|xenya: *4@S|pg||
nt|rhelle: well, 4 trumps, singleton, 5-card suit ... I like it|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cicus: my thoughts as well|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C bid - like it or loathe it?|pg||
nt|benjent: choke, cough, splutter|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: Plus side for 2@C = at fav vul, opponents often try to steal from you by opening light and responding light - so you might have 3NT on|pg||
nt|benjent: I bet North was wishing he'd passed 2@cX out when partner bid 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: yes that is what he said when he put down dummy|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|bg: EW continue to narrow the gap 33-23 after this|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|joest: 3@h is reasonable or perhaps even 3@c assuming it must be fit showing|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, that's what i meant|pg||
nt|rhelle: vulnerable game, just bid it|pg||
nt|cicus: I would not dare to try 3@C but I like 3@H|pg||
nt|cicus: I like 4@S as well|pg||
nt|april7: With this lead N should go down|pg||
pc|s5|nt|petergill: Minus side of 2@C = vulnerabiltiy is scary, might go minus 1100, 5332 shape is poor, suit quality falls away (bad pips)|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C response was transfer back to diamonds   showing a weak raise  presumable a 2 diamond immediate support would have been constructive|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|benjent: And the extra values means your 1100 is likely to be against ... a partscore|pg||
nt|petergill: and even on the actual hand, North didn't pass South's Dbl, fearing that South might have a singleton club|pg||
nt|benjent: Even so, how bad could it be? 180?|pg||
nt|petergill: North is very weak, so 380 is possible|pg||
nt|benjent: Even on the dud @sQ lead, 2@c gets carted|pg||
nt|benjent: Ahem. Please prepare for the sermon. If North didn't like his hand enough to keep on bidding it like an opening hand, then he shouldn't have started out with an opening bid|pg||
nt|petergill: South's attack on spades might be an attempt to put the opponents off from attacking spades themselves (on other layouts)|pg||
nt|petergill: Ben's point is very good|pg||
nt|april7: 2@S,2@H and 1 @C|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c6|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|benjent: Caught a handy switch too, with the @s play|pg||
nt|petergill: so we give South credit for the good spade play - he knew clubs would not be continued|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: matter of individual preference, that North hand - 3/4@S, or a weak two (:))|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|nt|petergill: South doesn't know that hearts are friendly, hence his long thinking|pg||
pc|c4|nt|benjent: How do EW play a 1NT overcall instead of 2@c? |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c8|nt|petergill: East's reverse count @S6 (or eprhaps it was a Smith Echo?) perhaps guided South to this line of play|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c9|nt|benjent: If strong, then South knows the @hQ is with East|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|rhelle: well played|pg||
nt|petergill: Oops |pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: it is true that playing limited openers S can pass with a better hand than in standard. the question is whether he SHOULD, esp at these colors. most players who use these methods ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would bid with S hand, I think, to keep EW a bit more in the dark and delay their entry into the auction|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: Not such a good choice now|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Sævar will definitely not stop short of the grand|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|rhelle: true - but in their system, over a major that is almost impossible|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead best|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: partner is not going to be carried away|pg||
nt|rhelle: as everything has a specialised meaning|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl of 1@D = 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|benjent: yeah, but if North comes down to @hKJ and @cJ10, then the last @s squeezes a little @h out of West and at the end he then knows for sure to drop the @hQ|pg||
nt|april7: probably 4NT - 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Dbl of 1@S = Support Dbl, showing 3 hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: stand not upon the order of thy going, but go at once |pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: even 1NT?|pg||
nt|mamos:  East's 6@S is not easy to explain|pg||
nt|snorris: :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|rhelle: i.e. over 1@h, 1@s = relay, 1NT shows @s, 2@c = any invite, etc|pg||
nt|cicus: that puts it in different light|pg||
nt|rhelle: it's easier over 1@d, as 1@h and 1@s are 6-12 and F1R - offes much more scope for messing around|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: in fact a heart lead could have held this to 7 tricks on perfect defence|pg||

nt|april7: yes, so why @H lead?|pg||
nt|ady: north bid 2@H  so south led a heart    not abnormal|pg||
nt|april7: S had a chance to even the board|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|benjent: hmmm ... I would have thought @dJ was clearly for a @c|pg||
nt|petergill: Why did West bid 2@H instead of 1NT? I don't know. |pg||
nt|petergill: His lack of a @D stopper put him off|pg||
nt|benjent: That would be partner's job :)|pg||
nt|petergill: @DJ was meant to be low - suit pref = don't play spades - but perhaps it was misinterpreted|pg||
nt|benjent: looks like it ... but without @dQ, @dJ is a loopy switch - surely he had some high pip he could have used instead|pg||
nt|petergill: If he can see all 52 cards, he plays @SA then a @D, but .....|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|rhelle: north is throwing distribution - high-low = odd|pg||
nt|benjent: he's essentially played North to be 5206|pg||

nt|petergill: Last board now|pg||
nt|tez: ok thanks|pg||
nt|ady: this is last hand of the session|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Almost the end now, so time for a few words of thanks: to our excellent operator  Bjorgvin Kristinsson, and to the Icelandic Bridge Federation (Olof and her staff) |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thanks also to Snorri Sveinsson and Roland Wald (Denmark) and Bruce Gowdy (Canada) for commentary. I am Mike Graham (England). Also thanks to all spectators for some useful and ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perceptive comments. |pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: And we've arrived at the last board for the first match|pg||
nt|ady: well  needed swing for Haustak|pg||
nt|april7: I don't believe it|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|Walddk3: Blimey, 4@S, that is some contract. I don't think you can make 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: cards lay well for 3NT    diamonds well placed|pg||
nt|mamos:  4@H looks better|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ady: e/w may get  more imps here if they play 4@H|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H would have worked after @D lead and even without|pg||
nt|april7: but 5@C went down in CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Then it's off to bed for us Aussie commentators (it's 11-15pm here), who will be replaced by Northern Hemisphere commentators for the next match|pg||
mb|3D|nt|snorris: @h in the right hand now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: even making 4 diamond tricks is enough|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|benjent: Commentary is a follow-setting-sun service :)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Many thanks to Björgvin, our very competent operator is Reykjavík|pg||
mb|4H|nt|benjent: 3NT is a cor blimey contract too|pg||
nt|ady: 1@H west?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: A rush of blood by both EW's|pg||
nt|benjent: I think Magnus was thinking about unblocking the @sQ there - give himself the best chance of forcibly setting up the @s suit|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Our Aussie commentators may be able to analyse bridge hands, but they can't pronounce the name of that (now) famous vulcano. Many have tried and it's hilarious every time you hear ...|pg||
nt|Walddk3: it on radio or TV|pg||
nt|petergill: Lead is good for NS. 3NT is not down yet ...|pg||
nt|benjent: I nearly got trapped in Hong Kong of all places.|pg||
nt|benjent: Various planes got stuck in Europe, so random flights in Asia got cancelled. Not mine, thank you|pg||

nt|vugraphzhn: we start again in 30 min|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|tez: 9 of @d now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: since the Dane can pronounce it - others here try something with yoghurt at the end|pg||
nt|benjent: Is it ... Eyjafjallajokull?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: next session 1 hour 40 minutes|pg||
nt|bg: the kokish auction showed 20 points 2c was stayman good contract|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: Easier to pronounce on BBO in writing than out loud|pg||
pc|dK|nt|snorris: and easier now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|benjent: Gotta start somewhere :) Roland - give us some hints!|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|benjent: @h switch gave away a @h trick, but NS should still be able to manage the beat|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|petergill: Even our Aussie flights (e.g. to Singapore) have been cancelled, because Singapore was clogged with European-bound planes. |pg||
nt|snorris: sympathize with the lead ..would probably have done the same|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|tez: psychological|pg||
