nt|Walddk3: Bridge Union)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|eggy: Suzanna Gross is relatively new to this level, but well known in London and a bridge journalist|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|2H|nt|eggy: Thanks for the background Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Last time a match was delayed was in year 39 BC when the Pompeii cricket team had to cancel after a vulcano erupted|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|heatherd: No easy game, despite the values|pg||
nt|henryb:  And here I thought that was 79 AD|pg||
nt|eggy: the 2@C bid may seem a bit rich for strong NT palyers ..|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|heatherd: 2NT will be GF so no chance of stopping in 3@c|pg||
nt|eggy: but is quite normal in English methods|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|eggy: It is likely that NS play x in traditional style though|pg||
nt|henryb:  And Fawcett should know that Brock has a stiff club because with any doubleton she would play on clubs not spades|pg||
nt|eggy: good point Henry|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|c4|nt|heatherd: This should drift 2 down, provided they stay off @hs|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c5|nt|henryb:  Now Fawcett should shift to the @cJ|pg||
nt|dburn: good discard, that @h8 - denies the ten, because with @hQ108 she would pitch the queen (or not have pitched any hearts at all)|pg||
nt|heatherd: Only 1 down now (she won't play a @h)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|eggy: or perhaps just contine diamonds, but she must pitch both her clubs to show out the end position|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i know full well that 3NT would be reached quite often|pg||

nt|henryb:  I think declarer carded wrong: she should keep five clubs in dummy and pitch three hearts. Her only hope to get out for 1 down is to find South with @sK and @hKJ|pg||

nt|roswolf: this is a trappy hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|athene: 1@D overcall from north might warn EW off 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: especially when south raises diamonds|pg||

nt|h_karluk: 2 way hook |pg||
nt|roswolf: this overcall may help e/w avoid the doomed 3nt but may welll bid to 5@C instead|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|nt|athene: south wants to get spades into it|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: and she will find a fit|pg||
mb|2C|nt|roswolf: support double?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: doubled 5@c could be a disaster|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|athene: looks as though EW play opener's double as strong notrump|pg||
nt|athene: they might play 1nt rebid there as showing 3 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: west has to restrain herself i feel|pg||
nt|athene: north will bid 2@S now perhaps|pg||
nt|roswolf: and she has:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: they do have a 4-4 fit but she does have a 7 count facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: it would be sad if opps woke up and bid a making game or something|pg||
nt|roswolf: well e/w got that one right|pg||
nt|athene: i am very surprised south didn't bid 2@D over 2@C|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I'm not fond of the light overcalls. It's reasonably effective when it works, but i personally hate the price i've to pay to use it. Givin' up sound overcalls is too great a loss ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for me. To me North's pass was better|pg||
nt|athene: when she doubles, she is taking a big risk of losing the diamond fit, just to try to get a spade fit into the picture|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup - a little suprising i agree|pg||
nt|athene: she was very lucky to be able to catch up and bid 2@D second time|pg||

nt|athene: but i think south was a bit over-cautious there - perhaps if west's double was explained as strong notrump or better, she just "deduced" that her partner had very little, but if ...|pg||
nt|athene: you start working out what partner has on the basis of what opps have shown, you get stung when e.g. east has bid off nothing|pg||

nt|roswolf: west took a flyer in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, you have a lot of losers for a 5-level bid at equal vul|pg||
mb|1C|mb|2N|nt|athene: apart from anything else, there's a really big danger partner might have a monster and take you seriously, and bid six or something|pg||
nt|athene: just pass 4@S and then if partner doubles again, ok, NOW perhaps you have a decision to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: could West does really have a decision after 3@s?|pg||
nt|roswolf: east might double if this is passed to her but west will just bid 4@C|pg||
mb|4D|mb|d|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|athene: 3@S non-forcing here; i assume NS play unusual vs. unusual|pg||
nt|athene: so with a forcing spade bid south would bid 3@H or something|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am quite surprised that W bought 5@c in OR, and paid -800|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|roswolf: WEST SHOULD STAND THIS|pg||
nt|athene: i think the double of 4@D should show a "strong" 2nt overcall|pg||
nt|h_karluk: overhelming, i hope mine is a fair criticism|pg||
nt|athene: so east doesn't need to double again|pg||
nt|athene: she already showed her hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: even -690 will gain imps!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: when 2nt can be such a range of strengths, your first priority is to be able to express the good hand - much more use than emphasising diamonds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and would overthrow partner in post-mortem|pg||
nt|athene: and as a spec points out, if NS bidding is to be believed, west has nothing (north's 4@D was a good spade raise), so doubling 4@S is asking for trouble|pg||
nt|athene: basically it's just asking partner to choose between -690 and -800|pg||
nt|roswolf: the dragon doubles on principle|pg||
nt|athene: i think east is way too aggressive here and she is lucky NS didn't send this back|pg||
nt|athene: maybe they are scared of her :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: redouble the dragon - needs a very stout heart:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unpleasant guess ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i would lead a heart which is clearly one of east's suits|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: I think five card major systems will almost gets to the best game, but because the auctions are oftgen long the defense will be accurate. On the other hand whatever benefits you ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: get from a lot of science, there's a lot to be said for direct, non-informative auctions. It can be very frustrating to play against a four card major system|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: *often - sry for typo|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks straightforward|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: Does anything other than 2@s make sense? ie 2N|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: will declarer consider running the @H9?|pg||
nt|athene: play the lead to be a singleton|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|roswolf: people dont often lead sigleton trumps especially an honour|pg||
nt|roswolf: sindgleton|pg||

mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|heatherd: Promising result for England here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: may not be easy for North-South to bid at all here - North needs to bid now|pg||
nt|eggy: and also to our wonderful operator, Kath Nelson|pg||
nt|Walddk3: N Ireland by 29 with 2 boards to go vs Ireland|pg||
nt|dburn: she did, which was a good effort - far from clear|pg||
nt|eggy: and to the EBU, running the event on behalf of Bgb|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|heatherd: 6 more to EBU on 29.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|Walddk3: Indeed, and they have been extremely busy after they had to re-arrange everything|pg||
nt|heatherd: wd NS|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Kudos to Michael Clark, Max Bavin and their staff|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Due to travel difficulties (vulcano ash   closed airspace), the weekend has been shortened to just Saturday and Sunday with 12 boards per segment (rather than 16). No bridge Friday ...|pg||

nt|eggy: might be a couple of imps here to England, I suppose|pg||
nt|eggy: Can you see the Derbyshire Peaks Kath?|pg||
nt|dburn: could be important, given that the last 23 boards appear to have been a waste of time|pg||
nt|heatherd: all square with just this result to come.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Back in about 37 minutes after s shortish lunch break|pg||
nt|Walddk3: England v Wales|pg||
nt|Walddk3: UBU v Ireland|pg||

nt|Walddk3: N Ireland v Scotland|pg||
nt|Walddk3: make that EBU|pg||
nt|eggy: R ooney playing I hear|pg||
nt|eggy: Not for the EBU that is :)|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - keeps missing sitters, arguing with the ref and fallign over|pg||
nt|Walddk3: No. I thought it was short for English Beachvolley Union|pg||

nt|roswolf: this may produce action|pg||
nt|athene: north perhaps has a 3@C bid over 1nt|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: it's always hard to show clubs these days, since bidding clubs at the lowest available level is never natural|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: practical bid by south|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with bidding over a weak notrump is that you actually need to be more disciplined, as game is much more likely, so you have to make it possible to bid constructively|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Four card players aren't always hurting in competition. They have a number of advantages:1-If the other side gets the bid. the opening leader will get off to a good lead 2-They get ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to open with 1@h or 1@s far more often than a five card major player. This can be advantageous for two reasons:a) it's harder to bid over 1@h or 1@s than over 1@c or 1@d b) when ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the opening bidder finds a fit responder can accelerate the bidding|pg||
nt|athene: south's decision here is whether to duck this|pg||
nt|athene: if she was 100% sure west had @SA of course she could win and play a spade|pg||
nt|athene: ducking risks a diamond switch which has its own problems|pg||
nt|athene: if you rise @DA you might have set up too many tricks for the defence|pg||
nt|athene: but if you duck, east puts a heart back and suddenly you are in big trouble|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmvthe ducking looks std|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you just duck this trick and throw a spade from dummy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: A good bridge player should bear in mind that sometimes the person you preempt is your partner|pg||
nt|athene: a) west is unlikely to find the diamond switch and b) even if she does you are quite likely to survive rising @DA|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: the defence aren't cashing three diamonds most of the time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true, however that isn't always ideal|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d4|pc|h9|nt|athene: ok, millions of tricks now|pg||
