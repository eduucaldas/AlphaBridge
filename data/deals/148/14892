mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|Vugraphzfb: Gail Greenberg just came in to kibitz - the director had come in and said "I had to keep one of the player's mothers from coming in (we don't let kibitzers in after the BBO ...|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ritong: nice|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|dburn: mind you, having opened the bidding West may now back-pedal, and Larsen may write off that @cQ following the overcall|pg||
nt|me argent: gail moss by the way is brads ma|pg||
nt|dburn: but 4@s may be enough encouragement assuming that 3@c was a game try and 4@s an acceptance|pg||
nt|dburn: rather than 3@c being a game force and 4@s fast arrival|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: There haven't been any alerts or questions asked, so don't know about 3@c or 4@s|pg||
nt|me argent: gail greenberg excuse me gail if you r watching |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Gail is at the table, so not watching on BBO|pg||

mb|5H|mb|p|nt|dburn: well, we don't have to live long enough - only Larsen does|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|dburn: but this is a chance, because slam was not bid at the other table|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|6S|nt|dburn: so one rather hopes that Larsen does not take the view that partner "must have" @dK and bid seven|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Brad asks about 5@h - showed the @h king|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d9|nt|dburn: but perhaps 5NT was something about specific kings, not wholesale kings|pg||

nt|hedyg: 1@d= 2+ @ds, 10-15|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: it might, but that would not have been such a good idea - 4@h and 4@s both look down from here|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@s= 4 cards|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hedyg: W hand is limited to 15 hcps , thus the 4@s bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 3-3 @ds should be np to make 12 tricks|pg||
pc|h9|nt|dburn: the trump suit is right for the Devil's Coup, but the rest of the hand is not diabolical at all - declarer just has a loser in each suit|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: last one|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ritong: he s also a strong backgammon player|pg||
nt|dburn: at any rate, 13 IMPs to Meltzer, in sore need of them to reverse the momentum|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: in the first quarter, the only lead to let a slam make was the diamond Q|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ritong: 3NT looks clearcut|pg||
nt|ritong: raising @cs would be quite an adventure|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe - is this a 2/1 auction?|pg||
nt|me argent: dont forget poker hank he is good at that to|pg||
nt|dburn: because if it is, then 3NT is not entirely obvious|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ritong: west does not have huge extras|pg||
nt|dburn: you can see why Larsen bid 3@c - he didn't want to play notrump from his side|pg||
nt|ritong: the @d void is not that sweet either|pg||
nt|dburn: but having sown the wind, he must now reap the whirlwind|pg||
nt|me argent: and why rose bid 4@Cs|pg||
nt|dburn: he didn't want to bid 3@d because Meltzer, with such as @cQx, might not feel able to bid 3NT, I guess|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess 4@s might make, but how can he bid it? and how can Rose pass it?|pg||
nt|ritong: how do you like this, kyle?|pg||
nt|reisig: yuck :)|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|me argent: east knows that west needs good @Cs to raise a 4th suit forcing to the 4 lev el|pg||
nt|dburn: he might just bid 5@c and pray|pg||
nt|sybarra: is that a technical term RR?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|reisig: yes|pg||
nt|dburn: no, he hoped that Rose would take 4NT as natural - and maybe it should be, but maybe it wasn't|pg||
nt|ritong: allo, houston?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I have a rule that 4NT can never be Blackwood when clubs is our trump suit, on the theory that it's so unlikely you'll be happy to bid it :)|pg||
nt|me argent: i guess this east doesnt pray on a saturday|pg||
nt|reisig: Kyle is thinking .."can we just start this hand over?"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Brad asks Rose about 4NT and she says "Blackwood" with no thought|pg||
nt|dburn: the good news is that 3NT would not (or at any rate did not) make either|pg||
nt|dburn: the bad news is that whatever Larsen does now, Moss may double him|pg||
nt|sybarra: may not X 6 clubs |pg||
nt|me argent: moss has a nose for these things |pg||
nt|dburn: but 6@c may be down only one for all of that|pg||
nt|reisig: here ..I'd bid 6@c and pray|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: loud|pg||
nt|sybarra: best we try bidding it in tempo |pg||
nt|me argent: thats because its saturday rich|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Fred passed a long time ago, of course, I was wool-gathering|pg||
nt|dburn: the trouble is that God, who heard you bid 3@c and 4NT, might reasonably view not to hear your prayer on the grounds that you are already beyond salvation|pg||
nt|reisig: Good David :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Best we let God decide that David|pg||
nt|ritong: now..|pg||
nt|ritong: shall we axe this, braddy?|pg||
nt|sybarra: think not |pg||
nt|me argent: the GREAT SHUFFLER  can be cruel|pg||
nt|sybarra: lets not disclose it |pg||
nt|warrens:  if Brad were behind, there's no question.  ahead, it's a bit different|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Meltzer: "ok, I have no idea what's going on"|pg||
nt|reisig: no comment|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, well - down one and a push - can't think what all the fuss was about, really|pg||
nt|ritong: *polite silence*|pg||
nt|sybarra: shall we go back to "yuk"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Apparently 2@d wasn't a game force, but 2@s was|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Vugraphzfb: Meltzer: "we're playing spades? that's not good news ... should have just played 3N"|pg||
nt|warrens:  the danger of doubling is not that they might run to 6@C, since he's knows that Larsen could have bid it.  it's that they might run to 5nt and make that.  after all, Larsen already tried to bid 4nt to play|pg||
nt|po-s: Even if you don´t play 2D plus 3D as forcing it certainly is after a reverse  - but maybe they don´t show extras with 2S after 2/1|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|henryb:  true enough|pg||
nt|dburn: but if that's how you;re going to play, better do it fast, or he will|pg||

nt|dburn: in truth, a diamond isn't totally out of the question - @hA will just set up declarer's king|pg||
nt|dburn: and even if it turns out that a diamond blows a trick, it may not be the twelfth trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then @Dx vs @DQ    small is a bit of a Grosvenor|pg||
nt|dburn: well, declarer will run a low diamond - how many points is North supposed to have, after all?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i was thinking low @C could [keyword] come from @DQxxx(s)  so Meltzer could hold @DJ|pg||

nt|dburn: and I guess they did respond 1@h after all too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Fred writing something - I think it's a question, but I don't know what it is - probably also about whether the DBL is always 4-4|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, Platnick showed the minors, so hard to Nunes to bid, and Diamond showed @H's, so not easy for Fantoni to bid|pg||
nt|reisig: 3@d coming|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kit: Doesn't look like N-S can make anything at 3-level anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: but I confess, I would have doubled when 2@c came round - there are too many villains about to pass|pg||
nt|reisig: Might push them to 4@c|pg||
nt|kit: Absolutely David -- defending at 2-level with a singleton in their suit is a no-no|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am wondering how they made it to the final if they can't bid|pg||
nt|dburn: and strong club pairs especially will rob you blind - but maybe I'm just paranoid|pg||
nt|kit: Larsen trying to weigh the offensive/defensive potential here.  He can assume his partner has 4 clubs and a stiff diamond|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kit: now this I don't understand -- why would he suggest anything but clubs?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Unless he means it as a game try, which seems very optimistic|pg||
nt|reisig: sounds like a game try in @cs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rose looks as if she doesn't understand it also - sort of frowning and staring at the bids|pg||
nt|po-s: she´ll bid 4S|pg||
nt|kit: with weak spades, Meltzer should know the 4-3 fit can't play well|pg||
nt|dburn: well, maybe Meltzer can have 5-4 in the majors, so Larsen is catering for that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, Larsen has denied four so it must be a feature of some sort|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think he's hoping for KQxx, Jxxx, x, KQxx|pg||
nt|dburn: although that would mean 5=4=0=4 specifically, which is not all that likely to have been dealt|pg||
nt|warrens:  even less is a good 5@C|pg||
nt|po-s: too much|pg||
nt|warrens:  He can make it with less, for sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: or, as Warren says, maybe game in clubs could make anyway - until Gitelman bid 3@d, Larsen did not know that Meltzer had a stiff diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: and that did improve Larsen's hand considerably|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: There are only 35 minutes on the clock - director just came in and said "we've gotten behind here, so have to pick up the pace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Still, he passed 1@H, so he can't have a big hand|pg||

pc|h5|nt|kit: Actually he is pretty close to double-dummy.  He knows both diamonds and hearts are 6-2 (no heart raise)|pg||

nt|kit: I wonder if the unusual NT is percentage here -- opponents have found fit, and the bid tells them how to play the trump suit if there is a problem there|pg||
nt|dburn: enterprising - may cause just enough confusion, since both East and West may now worry about two losing clubs|pg||
nt|kit: so it gains only if you find a successful save|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but it is also annoying for the oppenents because he took the 3-level away|pg||
nt|kit: good point David|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Meltzer and Moss discussing 3@c and 3NT - Meltzer says 3@c raise and I think Moss said 3NT = minors, but not positive|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: so there are some hidden gains for the call, and we may see one here|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Rose has a bidding card out (don't know what it is) but is reviewing the auction and thinking about it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am asked why Meltzer is worried about clubs. She is because Larsen has denied a control in clubs when he bid 4@D|pg||
nt|reisig: a very slow 5@s ..asks @c Queen?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Impossible for her to know that he has the queen|pg||
nt|warrens:  it does in my rubber bridge game|pg||
nt|kit: if she signs off, Larsen must pass, as for all he knows they are off 2 aces|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Now she's put the bidding cards back in the box and is thinking again|pg||
nt|poohbear: and there are 2600 witnesses as well Kit|pg||
nt|kit: specs saying 6NT is cold -- it is for us, but declarer may have to choose between heart finesse and club finesse|pg||
nt|po-s: after all Kyle made a move - with only one keycard|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: could she suggest 6NT (if there's a way to do that) to protect the @c K?|pg||
nt|po-s: he is a favorite to have goodies in hearts if nothing in clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: that may incline Rose to bid 6NT - maybe if partner doesn't have @cQ, he has @hQ instead|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|po-s: but as Kit says...6NT will probably go down|pg||
nt|kit: wonder what 5@H is.  Presumably 5@D is queen ask.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@H asking for good hearts?|pg||
nt|ritong: i bet larsen wonders too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think that is her intention|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: It looks as if Larsen wonders - he has his cards on the table and is sort of moving his hands around as if  wondering about what this is about|pg||
nt|warrens:  normally, doesn't this promise all the Keycards and ask for Kings?|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|6S|nt|Walddk2: In RKC as written by Kantar it is an asking bid in hearts I am told|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: remind me to tell David Bird about this hand - he is very fond of describing bids such as North's 3NT as fatuous, but...|pg||

nt|po-s: he can always bid spades....|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@h not inconceivable - partner might (should?) have five|pg||
nt|kit: Larsen is facing a passed hand, so from his point of view he doesn't have the strength to make 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good thing they are playing with screens. Larsen does not know if 2@S or 3@D was slow|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We know that it was 3@D|pg||
