nt|3for3: i dont see how the squeeze can work, though|pg||

mb|5H|nt|chip: with the 3S bid NS will surely save over 4H and may thake their OK save over 5H.|pg||
nt|dburn: East-West can make a slam, but they'd have to be pretty desperate to bid one|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip: E has rather little slam interest opposite an 11-15 opening.|pg||
nt|dburn: so the real question is... will South bid now?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: sorry Jeff got there first|pg||
nt|fann4: My computer a bit faster Al :)|pg||
nt|deltadash: right Al, as usual I spoke before I thought|pg||
nt|fann4: Now West has to exit a passive @S or a fancy @CJ or @C9 to get it 3 off.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: common ranges for balancing 1N   11-14  +/- one point on either end|pg||

mb|2D!|an|nat|nt|jdonn: here is a slam for the clerkins|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that time Dunitz also held 5@H & 4@D  and  jumped in @D|pg||
mb|2H|an|alerted|nt|fann4: This is a pretty decent slam. Needs @C 2-2 or the !K onside.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=game force 5+@D|pg||
nt|fann4: And depending on the lead, in @C you may be able to safety play @CA first too.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alert of 2@H must be some sort of pass/correct situation|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Dennis Clerkin passed with west hand over natural 1@C opener|pg||
nt|fann4: I predict NS reach 6@D|pg||

mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: Davis in 6@C|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|fann4: Why not raise the @D immediately - set the suit quickly, especially with the interference.|pg||

nt|fann4: These auctions can get murky now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Simson has put his hand down...staring intently at bidding tray|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but was it, and does 3@D show extras, hence 3@C and later diamond raise seems simpler to me|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ritong: when hemant plays slowly, it does not mean he is in danger to go down|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|fann4: What's the need to show extras at this stage? |pg||
nt|fann4: Was 4@H Kickback, someone asked? I have no idea.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Johnson held up one finger to Dunitz after bidding 4NT|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jdonn: they didn't even sniff this one, i don't know their system though|pg||
nt|ritong: it means that he does not want to throw off a trick for no reason|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1H forcing no doubt|pg||

mb|5H|nt|jdonn: 6nt happens to make but 6@d is much better|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|nt|fabsayc: but an automatic 1@S if that is what it was does not get you anywhere|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@H showing @DQ and @HK|pg||

nt|ritong: 2@c is more bothering for opps|pg||
nt|jdonn: 2@c is much riskier but he is trying to create action|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@d 2@c is the worst low start auction for the opening side|pg||
nt|fann4: From the play we saw, it was going a definite 3 down.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: A very surprising 4@H opening in the OR (Open Room)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe he ruffed @H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jdonn: 2@c is especially dangerous since E/W play a strong club system and might open 1@d on a hand with longer clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: reverse namyats?|pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6H|nt|me argent: salut hank|pg||
nt|fann4: There are a number of ways to play it|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: jerry almost out of punts|pg||
nt|me argent: 4@Ss EW is best spot|pg||
nt|jdonn: 4@s could make with spades breaking, they might need to ruff 2 clubs in the west hand|pg||
nt|jdonn: but east might be reluctant to bid 3@s now since it could be interpreted as real spade support, it's hard to say|pg||
nt|me argent: it has the virtue of making|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: gutsy|pg||
nt|jdonn: well they certainly found a way to go plus|pg||
nt|fabsayc: wow, was not expecting pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it's been confirmed -- Dennis Clerkin really did open 4@H|pg||
nt|fann4: Well, this is a very swingy board.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably down unless a club lead|pg||
nt|fann4: The lead is all-important here too.|pg||
nt|fann4: If NS play 'coded 9's and 10's leads' and the lead is the @C10.......|pg||
nt|fann4: Denying the Q.|pg||
nt|fann4: The longer he thinks, the more I think he will lead a trump.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fann4: But he may also be worried about the @S position and so attack with a @D|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|me argent: the clerkins must open very very light|pg||
nt|jdonn: jerry must have decided with no major suit fit and no club stopper that game wouldn't have good chances|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fann4: Double dummy there are 13 tricks available, with the @DK coming down in 3. but he'll be delighted to just make this.|pg||
