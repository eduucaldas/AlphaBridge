nt|casenjo:  he's left handed|pg||
nt|casenjo:  :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|casenjo:  This should be fun for me, I have played with Mike Passell and Boye Brogeland|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Welcome everyone |pg||
nt|brolucius: I am currently writing a book with Boye Brogeland, so I hope for some great hand in this set that we can use in the book.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  They are both marvelous players, that make you feel like you are relaxing in a rocking chair|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Not if you are playing against them!|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Welcome back to New orleans|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Hi all welcome|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Another close match tonight|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|sybarra: welcome also to Frank Budai, Australia   (rejoining us) |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh they changed names,  skip previous comment |pg||
nt|casenjo:  transfer to clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@S is a transfer to clubs and South will have two possible responses: 2NT and 3@C. 2NT would indicate a good fit for clubs.|pg||
mb|3H|an|transfer|mb|p|nt|casenjo:  Yes, 'in between pre accepts'|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|casenjo:  NS comes out shooting, bidding a game on a finesse, but alas the king is offside|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ritong: duboin should make this, he does not need to guess @ds when @cs split that way|pg||
nt|sybarra: the club players I was talking about are in the other room  but we have a great room!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer ducks, to leave West with an awkward comtinuation.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  And Boye has his work cut out for him on hand  1|pg||
nt|henryb:  gm all|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Hello, henry!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: two finesses actually|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|ritong: but he has a trump control problem|pg||
nt|sybarra: low @H from Jeff or a spade? |pg||
nt|ritong: so, if aker plays a @h back, south might consider pitching a @c|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
pc|d4|nt|brolucius: East's @S3 was a discouraging signal, warning West not to continue spades (into the lion's jaw - South's A-J).|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|henryb:  of all the continuations that was probably the worst|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: re-morning Frank |pg||
nt|ritong: salut frank|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Hi Frank, welcome back :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Phil Clayton|pg||
nt|phil: hello everyone|pg||
nt|warrens:  E/W play upside down attitude, standard count, I believe|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: G'day Phil, welcome|pg||
nt|iceking: i been told by 300 kibetzers i was little off what 2sp was, |pg||
nt|phil: hi Andy, excellent job at the keyboard btw|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi all|pg||
nt|iceking: 2sp was inviting bal without 4card major or sygnoff in clubs 3clubs from Zmud showed maximum |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@s = invite to 3NT without 4M or xfer to @cs ,  3@c 16-17 I want to play 3NT if you have an invitational hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|iceking: that was a nice def from Becker |pg||
nt|warrens:  Becker is a very, very fine defender.  Quite deliberate, but accurate.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d5|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||

nt|ritong: well giorgio recovered|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, a gentle start to the session.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  A friendly start for the Strul team|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Norwegian pair is incredibly aggressive when looking for slams. Most people would regard them as over-aggressive in that area.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Welcome to our Canadien expert!|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|frankaus: fasinating collection here|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmm  indeed |pg||
nt|ritong: he had some idea about @s Q location, since east did not cue|pg||
nt|fabsayc: Canadian, I am not french :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|casenjo:  oops! So Sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: North has passed. If he were to bid, he would have used transfers over a take-out double.|pg||
nt|dima:  Hi all|pg||
nt|henryb:  A possible game for E-W, and no safe harbor for N-S|pg||
mb|2C|nt|casenjo:  I was originally from Detroit, so close to Windsor that I was semi-Canadian, and do understand the difference|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Bjorn has something to think about here. It sounds to him like a pinocle deck|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|brolucius: 5@C is a lucky make, needing two good things to happen.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ugh |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: or should I say "yuck" |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: vuls wrong to act|pg||
nt|casenjo:  and the expert is correct, Bjorn new the vulnerability was wrong here|pg||
nt|casenjo:  knew, not new|pg||
nt|fabsayc: besides raising would have just helped opponents who actually have missed an excellent slam|pg||
nt|casenjo:  sorry, folks, had a couple drinks at dinner, please excuse my typing|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|ritong: the good old reversed two suiters|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No-one can double 3NT but it sure is a terrible contract|pg||
nt|frankaus: play missfits in 3NT is a common view|pg||
nt|brolucius: North may be considering 3NT. No, he has bid just 3@D.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Indeed; but passing 3@d by E is not appreciating how good her hand is|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was an unsuccessful bidding board for East-West. They can make 10 or 11 tricks in their best fit but have sold out to 3@D. |pg||
nt|henryb:  She was close (imo) between 2@c and 3@c on the first round|pg||
nt|dima:  Would X over 3@d be to compete some place or penalty? |pg||
nt|po-s: About an ace more than she might have had|pg||
nt|brolucius: East had two great cards for partner and had made only a forced 2@C bid.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: each player would rather have another pard,  if they could see all cards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: With clubs 3-2 it has *some* play, but this is awful|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to duck the @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that is easy |pg||
nt|frankaus: duboin did well to stay out of the action|pg||
nt|sybarra: your rightie opens you best suit,  easy to stay out |pg||
nt|frankaus: red light helped|pg||
nt|ritong: so this is a matter of number of undertricks|pg||
nt|frankaus: 50's :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: as pointed out to me,  then your lefty bids you next best suit,  |pg||
nt|sybarra: how does it feel now?|pg||
nt|ritong: going down less than your counterpart is also a way to win imps ( homer nods)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Neither North nor South liked their spade holdings and took the conservative road|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|sybarra: here comes a @D most likely |pg||
nt|sybarra: just make the communication a mess |pg||
nt|frankaus: u look at dummy u look at ur hand and still cant find even 6 tricks :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: 8 of @D or club?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you might hope for the clubs to break - I am not sure that Aker is contemplating suicide at this point|pg||
pc|sA|nt|frankaus: @S look probable|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a rare 3 or 7 hand|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
pc|d9|nt|brolucius: Brogeland and Saelensminde won the recent 3-day Lifemaster Pairs, here in New Orleans.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Fallenius has been living in New York, but according to Roland Wald, he will now be playing for Sweden again. Nice news for the Swedes. He is a marvelous player.|pg||

nt|caitlin: as we should expect|pg||
nt|iceking: very strong def from Becker perfect card from card|pg||
nt|Jacki: Welcome Linda Lee everyone who will be commentating for us here|pg||
mb|1N|an|15-17|mb|p|nt|lml: hello |pg||
nt|lml: its always a pleasure to watch Hamman and Zia|pg||
mb|4H|an|Tx|nt|phil: at the other table Passell continued with a low @d after the !k lead - perhaps he interpreted the @s5 as "I can tolerate a @d shift"?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|warrens:  e/w can make 5@C here|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: lucky spade break|pg||
nt|iceking: note Balickis pass bidding 1h after Beckers takoutdbl woudlnt make much sense |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D 11-18 with 5+ diamonds, or 11-16 with 4 diamonds and 5 clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: now after north will bid 3D maybe east can dbl that show max 2club bid or at least some values |pg||
nt|lml: well they dont usually bid their opponents cards!|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: if 2@c denied a major maybe 3@s by E instead of 4@c?|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes prefer X|pg||
nt|lml: pretty routine spot|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|iceking: i would just dbl looks clear to me |pg||
nt|iceking: east 2club doesnt really denie major i think |pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|hedyg: well for me that is the question|pg||
nt|warrens:  I know they made 4 in the other room, but I would expect -1 here.  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Apologies|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|c6|nt|iceking: jtxx x xx kqxxxx i think most players would bid 2clubs|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lml: interesting that South can lead any suit and any card (but the @DK) and Hamman will still make 4|pg||
nt|Jacki: Welcome Jack Oest everyone who will be helping Linda with the comments|pg||
pc|d5|nt|caitlin: should be down one|pg||
nt|warrens:  Strul will high-low in trump to show the spade K|pg||
nt|ritong: never mind|pg||
nt|joest: hi all|pg||
nt|lml: welcome Jack|pg||
pc|d3|nt|caitlin: np|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lml: apparently 4! is not so routine|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lml: 4@S|pg||
nt|lml: since they failed to get to game in the OR|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|joest: in the other room Quantin and Multon combined two conservative views into one adverse swing|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ritong: i guess zmud kept his @d 3|pg||
nt|caitlin: signalling so important in drawing map for pd|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Oh yes, Zmud has @D 3 in his hand|pg||
nt|iceking: i would assume this is error Adam doesnt make mistakes like this|pg||
nt|hedyg: tststs Andy LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg: Andy just doesnt like playing the 7 @d..........|pg||
nt|joest: auction develops much differently after a 1@h opener|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|lml: at least it was not vul|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
mc|10|nt|Vugraphzfd: Got that right ;)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|phil: helps when the operator is a good player like Andy is - he can reconstruct the play pretty effortlessly :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: amazing!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: True Phil, it takes a good player to be a good operator|pg||
nt|joest: West decided to go low (very low) with 2@s and east had a close call too|pg||
pg||
qx|o35|st||md|1SK95HJ63D98764C84,SAQJT2HKT8542DCQ7,S8743HQ9DK52CAT32,S6HA7DAQJT3CKJ965|sv|e|nt|sybarra: and no more questions pls about computer dealt hands |pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure why he did not play for seven, is doubtful he will get any useful info by playing the spades about whether to finesse in diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: has nothing to do with it|pg||
nt|casenjo:  The opening lead places those high cards with south, and north bid vulnerable. Kamil's problem is: did North bid on strength or length?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|frankaus: brb|pg||
nt|brolucius: East might have given a suit-preference signal on the first round of hearts, attempting to show the @SK to her partner.|pg||
nt|henryb:  appreciate in the sense of gaining understanding, not in the sense of getting warm feelings|pg||
nt|po-s: This is a European fight in a way; Norway against Poland/Russia|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|ritong: if there ever was a horse beaten to death, it would probably be computer deals|pg||
nt|brolucius: I believe that only 3 or 4 of the top 20 seeds have an all-American squad.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  The best bridge book I ever read is Mike Lawrence's "How to Read Your Opponents' Cards"|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: All enlightenment is appreciated, Hensry|pg||
nt|warrens:  wow, helness didn't balance over 2@H but Gromov did over 3.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: some how do not see a double coming at this table |pg||
mb|3C|nt|henryb:  or in the sense of gaining value|pg||
nt|warrens:  this looks like it'll be expensive|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sit next to a mirror :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: all of this bids are alreated|pg||
nt|casenjo:  or place one behind the table|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ritong: but it is so human to blame a machine rather than your own skills|pg||
nt|dburn: not quite sure why the final contract was doubled at the other table - sure, South opened the bidding, but even so...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: and indeed we have beaten this to death,   |pg||
nt|Walddk4: It would also be unwise as the defence can't come to more than 1 heart, 2 diamonds and 1 club|pg||
nt|sybarra: are the results of round 3 posted?  so we know?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 3 hearts with only 6 is tricky|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: *do|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that actually happened to me in a regional in seattle, we were set up in the hall|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Click on Round of 32 to the left|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Roland |pg||
nt|casenjo:  The lead opens to 20, when the diamond slam was bid in the other room on Board 34|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes and after south raised spades :)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  They usually cover the mirrors in the hotel playing areas, I once played where they forgot to cover the mirrors on the ceilings.  They were on strange angles and everyone could see all of the hands.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i shift to spade 9|pg||
pc|cA|nt|warrens:  best line looks to be to ruff a diamond and lead a small club to the 10|pg||
pc|c5|nt|brolucius: Brogeland likes an 8-11 point weak-two opening. Weaker hands are shown with a multi 2@D.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dburn: maybe Maksymets was anxious that his partner should lead a diamond anyway|pg||
pc|c6|nt|warrens:  :)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the reasoning is partner needs a diamond stopper to beat hand, and declarer wont be finessing in spades with other options|pg||
pc|dA|nt|warrens:  I see 3 @S's, 2 @D's and 2 ruffs.  maybe an extra spade trick, but at best -500, so lose 9 imps or 12|pg||

nt|iceking: this was little bid sloppy play from Adam would have been better line in trick 2 play trump to dummy and heart to king |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's perfectly normal to be in game|pg||
nt|joest: when you are playing against Nickell you KNOW that is an adverse swing :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: probably against most of the field really|pg||
nt|joest: interesting to see what Zia opens here|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|caitlin: curious 2@S|pg||
nt|caitlin: result|pg||
nt|joest: some would just start with 1@s and some would open 1@h and pattern all the way out|pg||
nt|lml: thats what I would do|pg||
nt|lml: open 1@h|pg||
nt|joest: Zia in camp  2|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|joest: me too|pg||
nt|lml: I like to bid my longest suit first|pg||
mb|2S|nt|caitlin: fit showing|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: btw, some might ask "couldn't Zia bid 3@s there"|pg||
nt|joest: and in the old days yes but in these days that's a splinter|pg||
nt|joest: so you have to bid 2, then 3|pg||
mb|3C|nt|iceking: reaching 2sp with these cards is hard to understand |pg||
nt|ritong: it would be interesting to have other room auction, to see where the booboo is and avoid it ourselves|pg||
nt|iceking: 14hcp vs 12 and 6card suit |pg||
nt|iceking: been told south opened weak 2 spades|pg||
nt|caitlin: did S open 2@S in closed? Results do not show whether or not|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: yes he did thus no 4@S|pg||
nt|iceking: its the only logical reason really to end up in 2sp if south opened 2sp|pg||
mb|3S|nt|phil: B-Z's cc: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/poland/balicki-zmudzinski2010_05.pdf|pg||
nt|caitlin: he did|pg||
nt|iceking: not much in play here declerar will end up with 11 tricks |pg||
nt|caitlin: anyone understand S opening 2@S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|lml: this approach is better anyway because Hamman gets to show his hand too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: yes and Zia has shown his sixth heart too so that Hamman can bid 4@h and know what he's doing|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lml: actually I think you can make 4@S too|pg||
nt|joest: Hamman bids 4@h not 3NT b/c the spades can certainly come into play with hearts as trump.  Transportation and trick sources might be much dicier in 3NT|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hedyg: miscounted?|pg||
nt|caitlin: quacks yes but......|pg||
nt|iceking: sure he just downgraded his hand with so many losers |pg||
nt|hedyg: small @c lead impossible to find here i guess|pg||
nt|iceking: they might play 2sp sound even i think they used to do that before like 10-13 maybe silla forgot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They were both super-max for their action; happens. The good news for the Strul team is that it is NV|pg||
nt|phil: Im scouring the net for a cc for NS at the other table - have found several for the individuals with differnet partners|pg||

mb|1N|an|14-16|nt|ritong: rebid*|pg||
nt|Walddk4: As David pointed out, the auction might die in 2@H wihout this gadget, as happened at the other table|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: match is rapidly getting out of hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Some action again here|pg||
nt|dima:  If Gromov passes he will have a chance to double 4@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gromov choices are P, 4@S, RDBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Helness started with PASS but let them off the hook later in the auction|pg||
nt|dima:  East hand looks like a lot of defence and he faces 2nd seat VUL preempt|pg||
mb|2H!|an|!hs + minor|nt|henryb:  P.O. Stay! there is no other table to watch|pg||
nt|dima:  So we are for business here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|3D|nt|Walddk4: Maybe I can find a document with 28 pages of Gazzilli system notes|pg||
nt|sybarra: "accepting the transfer with a good hand |pg||
nt|henryb:  @h + longer minor?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.acbl.org/nabc/bulletins/2010/02/6/  pages 8&9 for team rosters|pg||
nt|brolucius: South buys a great dummy, just as his partner did on the previous deal.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dima:  A good point to discuss with your reg partner, most play XX = pls stay out of my way|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Xmas arrives and 2@s trick go through to boot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 philosophies   1 says if pure defensive hands  PASS then DBL  so that RDBL then DBL is more cooperative|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other says RDBL first to enlist partner  but RDBL/DBL says PEN|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it helps to be on same page as partner :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  The heat is on - now they might get to @d|pg||
nt|dima:  Strul wishes to find a bid to say YOU choose :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Strul wants to RE-RDBL  to say  no-no  YOU choose|pg||
nt|ahollan1: our comments crossed in the ether Dima|pg||
nt|dima:  happens from time to time :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either  a) assume more likely 5@D than 5@H  OR  b) bid 4@H because it is game|pg||
nt|dima:  I dont think you care too much about GAME here :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores for scores|pg||
nt|fabsayc: updates after each segment|pg||
mb|p|pc|c4|nt|ritong: well, for our specs interested, google is your friend|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.freewebs.com/bobbybridge/conventions/Gazzilli%20Convention.htm  here is a shorter version|pg||
nt|ritong: roland is your friend as well|pg||
nt|dburn: just how strong was 1NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 15-17|pg||
pc|c3|nt|casenjo:  24 imps have been gained by NS when EW misread slam hands; Board 34 6 diamonds was made in the other room and on 38 they stopped in game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense signal problem here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dima:  This rather about the first digit in front of 00|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right - i was just trying to come up with any rationale for Strul making a choice|pg||
nt|dima:  And Alexander Dubinin comes to help with @d - lovely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would North bid the same way with 4@H 5@D?|pg||
nt|dima:  Strul is going to have some more grey hair till this board is over|pg||
nt|dima:  I think one MIGHT bid 4@d with 5@d and 4@h as some kibs point out|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I think it is unclear since there is always a [slim] chance that partner won't be able to bid EITHER red suit|pg||
nt|dima:  Oh well now one still has to play the hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: South could easily be  3226|pg||
mc|8|nt|dima:  With that it might be more prudent to run from 4@c XX to 5@c :)|pg||
nt|dima:  And they will get a @h ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with natural trump trick isn't it?|pg||
nt|dima:  So let's see - 2@s + 1@c + 2@h + 1@d that is 800 to begin with|pg||
nt|dburn: that may be all - not so bad|pg||
nt|dima:  could be worse from Strul's perspective :)|pg||
nt|dburn: but hearts would have been better - perhaps not really possible to get to those, since Strul wasn't allowed to reredouble 4@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: while we ponder I'd like to retract an earlier statement of mine   Gromov-Dubinin have always played Precision throughout   i was thinking of a different pair [martens-jassem] who ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: play Precision or Polish depending upon vul|pg||

nt|joest: here is a hand where many players cheat these days and open 1NT|pg||
nt|lml: make North sweat|pg||
mb|1C|nt|joest: tht is not the French style however|pg||
mb|1S|nt|joest: I agree|pg||
nt|lml: I am fine with opening 1@C on this hand|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3H|nt|joest: interesting choice|pg||
nt|lml: and it dos get your best suit in|pg||
nt|joest: many wouldmake a responsive double|pg||
nt|joest: in fact I might be in that 'many'|pg||
nt|lml: the plus of 3 clubs assuming partner has at least 3 is similar to Zia s bid before|pg||
nt|lml: creats some pressure|pg||
nt|joest: guess what?  Meckwell bid 4@s on the last board|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: surprise!|pg||
mb|4D|nt|joest: 4@c here is a 'total trick' type of call trading on the almost certainty that partner has 5 clubs for his raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: i can't think that south is contemplating something more|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: not too surprised with that|pg||
mb|p|pc|c4|nt|lml: doubling games is not that bad a plan|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Still no open room operator online I am sorry to say|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: This happened to me the first time i vugraphed bad internet connection is not the way to go|pg||
nt|dima:  NS will probably be relieved to see that they lost only 5 IMPs here|pg||
nt|casenjo:  so, this is 5 more for DeKnijff|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|sybarra: Dorothy Truscott |pg||
nt|dburn: but that was a good effort all round - declarer kept his head, and the defenders needed to be and were accurate at the finish|pg||
mb|1S|nt|casenjo:  They have gained 33 imps in 7 hands..that is a LOT|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: mannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny years ago |pg||
nt|casenjo:  When things like this happen to me, I find it is a good idea to get upn and get a glass of water|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S interesting bid, it would be a splinter or stopper ask for most partnerships|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: apparently fallenius plays it as stopper showing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H implies spade fit, and lead directing by a passed hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is a two edged sword though, as might help defense if you end in spade contract|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dburn: spades? anyone got any spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgeguys.com/pdf/GazzilliND.pdf  for a longer version of Gazzilli, 18 pages. Worth reading if you have nothing better to do|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not a very productive 24-count, partly because both hands are 4-3-3-3.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And the way the broadcast is set up, Asya can't enter results from the other room|pg||
nt|henryb:  and no suits break|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT 18-19.|pg||
nt|dima:  Who needs spades :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oops|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dburn: well, if you want to score plus 420 instead of plus 110, you need spades - and you need to bid them|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kamil is either also bidding tactically or not on same wavelength|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 4+@D, unbal    they open weak NT with 44441@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: i second that|pg||

nt|ritong: a friendly dummy to come|pg||
nt|brolucius: Is it possible for Brogeland to show restraint ever? No!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I will get results from someone sooner or later|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: This is a contract even I can make, also at 4:55 am. 6 hearts and 2 spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: I said joost,  meant Jack Oest    |pg||
nt|casenjo:  I'm surprised at Kamil, it is pretty normal to have support for spades on this auction, since west is  a passed hand, he didn;t open 2 hearts....|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: maybe he figured anything undoubled was ok|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|brolucius: We will see if Erik can make bricks out of straw.|pg||
nt|dima:  Probably did not like the idea of having to find a bid after 1@d - 1@s - 2@d - ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C was 6+@C, 9-11 HCP|pg||
pc|s5|nt|casenjo:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: didnt mean to click alreat|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: No hurry to test the hearts, clearly. Instead declarer tries to make something of the diamonds.|pg||

pc|h7|nt|dburn: oh, indeed he didn't, and I have a lot of sympathy with the choice of 3@c|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: interesting that neither pair could find the @S fit|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: One trick back, but not enough I think|pg||
nt|casenjo:  well, you were right, he made 1 brick|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h5|nt|brolucius: I remember how annoyed I used to get, every time a team-mate said 'Going to 3NT didn't matter. We couldn't make 2NT.'  Ah, yes, very wise. For most people that would be an ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: very good bridge at this table so far, as we would expect|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|joest: another partnership question: when north raises to 3@h here, is that forcing?|pg||
nt|joest: to me: no way|pg||
nt|lml: it really cant be since 2@H is forcing|pg||
nt|joest: no the raise to 3|pg||
mb|d|an|!C + 2!S|nt|lml: what I meant was that 3@H cant be forcing since otherwise once South bids 2@H you are forced to game with a fit|pg||
nt|joest: quite a few seem to think that 'two over one' applies here|pg||
mb|4C|an|shortness|mb|p|nt|joest: although 4@c is quite a big bid with that hand! :)|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|lml: I think it is too much|pg||
nt|joest: it's interesting that Hamman is taking no action with five card club support for Zia|pg||
nt|joest: maybe he is afraid of pushing them too high|pg||
nt|lml: I have to say Pilon will do well to pass|pg||
nt|joest: in the other room, 4@h was also reached on that last board but Rodwell did not double|pg||
nt|lml: its hard to think of a hand where partner bids 4@C and you dont have slam chances|pg||
nt|joest: well: how about this hand? :)|pg||
nt|lml: I guess it depends on what you think a splinter like 4@C should show|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Pilon long pause|pg||
nt|lml: if it is normally this weak then yes South should pass|pg||
nt|joest: I presume Pilon has seem north's splinters before|pg||
nt|lml: but I would be stronger|pg||
nt|joest: there is no safety in five either|pg||
nt|lml: yes five can go down for sure|pg||
nt|joest: Hamman can duck the spade lead and give his partner a ruff when Zia comes in with the trump ace|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|joest: there was a hand bid by the French many years ago|pg||
mb|5H|nt|joest: they were playing in a world final|pg||

nt|sybarra: so where do you start the bidding with N?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C I presume|pg||

nt|brolucius: Sally Brock wrote a book that included several deals that had not gone well. She had my admiration for it. |pg||

nt|Walddk4: However, the tables are not linked so that won't help a lot as far as comparisons are concerned|pg||
nt|jtr: He seems lovely|pg||
nt|casenjo:  it appears to be 17-6 Strul after the first 5 boards|pg||
nt|jtr: Sry |pg||
nt|brolucius: I am tempted to predict that this will be the world's flattest 3NT. We will see.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  You are bold, I'm rarely tempted to predict|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even Reese was self-deprecating at times. 'I am about to play a diamond when, at the last minute, I realise that...'|pg||
nt|dima:  The bidding was the same|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, 4@s wasn;'t cold, but it would have been more interesting to watch than 3@c|pg||
nt|dburn: still, at least Gromov played it quickly|pg||
nt|dima:  THAT is true :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the only difference is that Helgemo's 1@D was 4+ but could have been balanced|pg||
nt|dima:  And playing Precision you dont have a lot of power to make 4@s after opening at most 24 points so go with 7-card suit|pg||
nt|dima:  I think Reese called those 7411 girafe hands or so|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: quick break|pg||
nt|dima:  Kibs suggest swans and cologne :)|pg||
nt|dburn: both correct|pg||
nt|dima:  In any case Reese claimed that those hands should be played in 7-card suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the range for NS weak 2s is 6-12   it's been a long long time since i've seen that range|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dburn: may depend on vulnerability to an extent|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, if North can have 12 then South should bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the only qualifier on their CC is  "may be light 3rd favorable vul"|pg||
mb|1N!|an|semi-forcing|nt|brolucius: When you have put your foot into it 50 times, you cease worrying about the 51st time.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk4: Tables are linked now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Open room operator catching up|pg||
nt|dima:  Try :)|pg||
nt|dburn: and if South bids, North may take the view that his 6-4 shape entitles him to show a maximum|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|dima:  Would not MANY of us think it is maximum even within 6-12 range|pg||
nt|dburn: and if all of that comes to pass, North-South will reach a pushy game that they will not make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: CC doesn't describe replies to 2N :(|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Common to play transfer responses opposite 1@C nowadays|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ritong: first step OK right sided NTs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: artificiality follows, as they say|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dburn: hang on a minute - I hadn't thought of that game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: best line now looks to be win diamond,draw two trumps then play diamonds|pg||
nt|casenjo:  South shouldl not anticipate anything strange|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C is check-back, looking for a spade or heart fit.|pg||
nt|dima:  Apparently neither did Becker :)|pg||
nt|dburn: neither had Becker, though I am not sure he was allowed to overrule his partner - depends on the details of their agreements|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: now aren't you glad you're wearing your seat belts?|pg||
nt|dima:  Maybe the rules are: direct 3NT = shut up, 2NT+3NT = allowed to think?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|casenjo:  The opponents hold 18 HCP and 10 hearts and never entered the bidding|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess West would lead a club against 3NT, and in practice it would not make either|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ritong: @h lead to save an imp|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 2NT=asking, usually balanced|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 3@D=1 suiter in spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 3@H=At least 1 top honour in spades, 3@S=6+@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see I have made one of my famous incorrect comments. 1@C was not natural and 1@H is part of their system responses.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I think 3 hearts is Smolen, 4 hearts, 5 spades|pg||
pc|d4|nt|brolucius: I am told they are playing 'a sort of Blue Club'.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am glad they wrote this out for you Andy,  we were slightly lost |pg||
nt|dburn: not actually clear that 6NT by North is best - maybe 6@s by North is better|pg||
nt|dima:  Hmmm can declarer drop @h King now?|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess at double dummy this may have a chance also, but in practice I doubt very much that Becker will make it|pg||
pc|h8|nt|brolucius: Well, at least my prediction of 'world's most obvious 3NT' did not go down the chute. Not that I was sticking my neck out very far with that. |pg||
nt|casenjo:  So,it would appear things are splitting|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes suggests even breaks|pg||
pc|c3|pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ritong: mm|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|ritong: going down in 6NT means @ss5/0 offfside|pg||

nt|dburn: that's his normal play for sure|pg||
nt|dima:  low @h now?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: dropping the singleton K wouldn't have worked anyway|pg||

pc|sK|nt|dburn: sure it would - two top spades, three more rounds of hearts and West is down to all clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still loses one trump|pg||
pc|sT|nt|casenjo:  he has now forced them to break clubs for him,,guaranteeing his contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this costs a dummy entry and gives up on establishing diamonds|pg||

nt|brolucius: On hand 8, where North made 400 here. They went one down in 2NT (as you would expect) at the other table, for a 10 IMP swing.|pg||

nt|dburn: may or may not be a good time for the dread four-card-suit overcall|pg||
nt|dima:  This will take some handling|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the fact that 1@D is always unbal will help Strul with @C|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@h isn't at all a bad contract, but the breaks aren't great|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: transfer response to 1@C, and 2@D artificial game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South's hand was too slam-worthy for Brogeland to bid 4@H, probably. 3NT will show no shortage.|pg||
nt|dima:  I think Strul will have a good picture after defence takes 3 tricks|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|vugraphzfe: 3@H = no major, 3@S = transfer to 3NT|pg||

nt|brolucius: I wonder if the 6-1 diamond break will help declarer in the play. Even if a diamond is led, declarer can play a spade at some stage and West will have no further diamond to play.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: He is a good player|pg||

pc|c6|nt|brolucius: North would have bid 2NT if he held four hearts. 3@C shows only three-card support.|pg||

nt|dburn: still, he has a chance if he can draw the right inferences from the bidding|pg||
nt|dima:  I think the contract will be made|pg||
nt|warrens:  he's got to play the @C 10 from his hand before he draws the last 2 rounds of trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D [from auction]  4@S  so either  4441 or 4144|pg||

nt|dima:  Match is very close now |pg||
nt|dburn: well done Strul - that overcall was a solo effort, but there was nothing shabby about his play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fallenius may have a two opening for this hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Probably would hold it to 4, but not beat the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Some would double on the West hand, hoping to survive a removal if partner responded in clubs.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Something like 4@C may be a fit jump now. But they could play it as a splinter. More likely. |pg||
nt|henryb:  depends whether a conversion to @d would show extra values. Sharp division of opinion on so called "equal level conversion"|pg||
nt|brolucius: East would like to show clubs as well as diamonds, rather than name a shortage.|pg||
nt|dima:  And now Precision might place the declarership of @h contract in the wrong hand|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 1@C is the only strong bid for EW  [2N is artificial]|pg||

mb|1N|nt|sybarra: making 4 @H |pg||
nt|dima:  OUCH|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: maybe you could make a slam if you were in it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We are hoping to show two matches from tomorrow and onwards, but it depends on operator availability|pg||

nt|ritong: aker will not like this holding in @c shortness|pg||
nt|ritong: @d singleton is not yummy either|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he has a good hand apart from that - 4@c something of an overbid, but...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If 4@H denies shortage he had no choice. It's too good for 3@H|pg||
nt|ritong: on the bright side, the ninth trump and relatively solid suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H 5+@H, game force|pg||
nt|fabsayc: gues not|pg||
mb|2S|an|not necessarily real spades, |nt|henryb:  another case of DOIGB|pg||
nt|henryb:  Down One Is Good Bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: wow|pg||
mb|3D|nt|brolucius: Nothing much wrong with 5@D. It is a gamble but it might cause South a problem if he had a good hand.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Of course 4@s would have been better bridge: down 2|pg||
nt|casenjo:  should Boye overtake and try to cash|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, East has not bought well, because partner is short in her second suit. That is why a fit-jump can work well, allowing partner to judge the fit.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I'm not sure East is strong enough for a fit-jump|pg||
nt|dima:  Now need to drop @c Q offside in 6NT from East - tall order|pg||
nt|dburn: lead could be changing hands here - these have been mighty blows by Strul and his cohorts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: some who play multi can open 2M with his hand type|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Brogeland|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  3@s might be a serious slam try|pg||
mb|3H|nt|casenjo:  a free bid of 3 clubs, followed by supporting diamonds could excite west when they do have a double fit|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, if 4@C would be a splinter, you could try 3@C.|pg||
nt|henryb:  you might have to do that at the five level|pg||
nt|casenjo:  and keep them out of trouble when they don't have the double fit|pg||
nt|henryb:  the @d support, I mean|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had East been a passed hand, most players would say that 3@C did show a diamond fit as well.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  i do|pg||
nt|brolucius: A 'support non-jump' some call it.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or balanced with no @S stop?|pg||

mb|4H|nt|Walddk4: It's easy to make with all cards in view|pg||

nt|ritong: he will think for a while|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the never are for me |pg||
nt|sybarra: (btw, I put this hand down and say "always the challenge by me pard,  gl"|pg||
nt|ritong: "natural" approach of the @ds is to ruff one, in case of drop, then decideif north follows to the third round|pg||
nt|ritong: which would not be the case|pg||
nt|ritong: but there is an other detail to cope with|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It would be a different ballgame on a spade lead|pg||
nt|ritong: the losing @s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Still, declarer has a couple of options|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Closed Room is also in 6@H on a club lead from South|pg||
nt|ritong: @c lead is more friendly|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|casenjo:  looks like a good place for trick  10|pg||

nt|casenjo:  no pre-nup?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  but, he only has 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hK|nt|casenjo:  5 spades, 3  hearts and 1 club|pg||

mb|p|nt|phil: yes, I'm sure thats the collective choice of the Lynch team :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: spade over call   |pg||
nt|sybarra: ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not a good idea with almost 2000 kibs and several commentators sitting like vultures on a branch, watching your every move.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Might try 5@D?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  a player messaged me "a 6D PUNT!?"|pg||
nt|brolucius: A tricky bid, anyway.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I answered: this would be the hand for it|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think I would bid 3@s, then 5@d|pg||
nt|brolucius: If he bids 5@D, North will bid 6@D. A vulnerable 5@D bid deserves respect and they HATE missing a slam.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|dima:  E was allowed toplay in 2@h .. and NS are close to 4@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: disciplined jeff |pg||
nt|casenjo:  that jump might be enough to turn Boye on|pg||
nt|Walddk4: close?|pg||
nt|caitlin: wd|pg||
nt|dima:  Now they are IN :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It will take some effort to go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I am doing my best!|pg||
mb|3D|nt|henryb:  If North bids 4@h, South will almost surely try 6@d|pg||
nt|reisig: 16 X 4 = 64|pg||
nt|casenjo:  i'm with you henry, but Boye thought otherwise|pg||
nt|brolucius: 50-50 now that North will add a sixth diamond.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I too am often wrong|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I still like your bid after the jump to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  you are TERRIFIC!!!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: np, your doing fine|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: :)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Are you perched on a stool above the table, craning your neck to see what is going on?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kamil may cue bid spade ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: and im trying to hear but i cant hear anything|pg||
nt|casenjo:  For those watching, that have not seen the vugraph room itself, this is a painful experience!!!! The screens are in the way, the players are in the way and the operator is trying to insert alerts and comments while following bidding and play|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ritong: now the natural version of gazzilli|pg||
nt|brolucius: North might have long hearts to bid 4@H. 5@D still shows a giant hand via the double.|pg||
nt|phil: Strul piling it on|pg||
nt|dburn: better not let them play it, then|pg||
nt|dima:  -300 is better then -620|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4NT if ace asking is commital, but it could be a spade cue bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Now the odds favor playing East for the missing @HQ. That is the Theory of Vacant Places. West has six spades to East's two, so East has more vacant places to hold the @HQ.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with 4@S as the ace asking bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Again they try to make me look stupid!|pg||
nt|phil: saves about 3 IMPs here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: For some reason the score on 55 was changed so Cayne gained 10 IMPs. The 4@H= next door has been changed to 3@H+1|pg||
nt|dburn: usually 8 IMPs or so better - here, only 3 IMPs better|pg||
nt|Walddk4: HH got away with murder in the open room, entire set more or less, and if it had not been for Gromov-Dubinin at this table it could have been worse for Lynch|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: i dont do those switches, they require huge amounts of discussion|pg||
nt|fabsayc: anyway 5@C is plenty high enough|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Well, these guys know their stuff, we have not had any bidding misunderstandings|pg||
nt|fabsayc: has 12 on cross ruff, but i expect a trump lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually he does not, club nine will overruff |pg||
nt|casenjo:  Bjorn can overruff with the nine and shift to a club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he needs to score both 5 and 8 of clubs for cross ruff to work|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: 2@h clarifying|pg||
nt|sybarra: so how do they tell difference?|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 2 @H  I see |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Gazzilli strikes for the second time in this set|pg||
nt|ritong: lauria s overcall with the boss suit makes it a little different|pg||
nt|sybarra: perhaps it is time for USA to take a look at this!!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And the match is virtually over with this one and after the change on 55|pg||
nt|ritong: i know bart bramley already had a serious look at it|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Passell is trying to beat 5D, he would make a differnt lead vs slam|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ritong: and he certainly has colleagues|pg||
nt|dburn: used to be called Cole in the old days|pg||
nt|sybarra: so David what made it Gazilli?|pg||
nt|ritong: the name of its creator|pg||
nt|ritong: in italy|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|po-s: beter not return a club...|pg||
pc|s8|nt|dima:  Now @c Ace is safe|pg||
nt|dburn: wasn't all that clear for North to bid 2@s, as Passell did, but if 2@h had come back to South (as it did at the other table) Strul would probably have had another go|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Cole is not as comprehensive as Gazzilli|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|sJ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|s9|pc|h9|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d3|pc|h4|nt|dburn: Bill Cole lived in Italy?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can ruff two diamonds high to assure making|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is the key moment|pg||
mc|12|nt|Walddk4: You can also have the version with 89 pages if you wish|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Boye would have found the heart queen anyway and made 6|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|joest: 6@c a bit better than 6@s here|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: but both will make easily|pg||
nt|lml: yes it is a better contract |pg||
nt|lml: but both make I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Hamman took off glasses to think better|pg||
nt|joest: east-west have similar hands|pg||
nt|joest: limited high cards but huge fitting hands|pg||
nt|joest: Hamman's 3@c bid is interesting|pg||
nt|lml: I like Bob s 3@C bid|pg||
nt|joest: many if not most players would raise to 3@s, particularly after a 2@s rebid, to set trumps|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|lml: Bob knows he can support spades later|pg||
nt|joest: but it might sound like a preference|pg||
nt|lml: it certainly works well on this hand.   I guess it depends on how the auction evolves.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: glasses on, now back off again|pg||
nt|joest: i'm having people challenge my quick assertion that 6@c is better -- and they are convincing me they are right|pg||
nt|joest: 4@d was RKCB for clubs?|pg||
nt|lml: well you have 12 tricks if things break decently in either contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: hmm|pg||
pc|dK|nt|joest: by any chance operator might you know what 4@d was?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 4@D Q|pg||
nt|joest: i have a hard time beliving Bob would blackwood with a void frankly|pg||

nt|sybarra: 322..........ugh|pg||
nt|brolucius: I certainly thought that, somehow, they would get to 6@D. In the slam-bidding area, they more often get too high than stay low.|pg||
nt|phil: well 4225 is posible, but s/v @d is more likely for sure|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, sure - both North and South at the other table expressed varying degrees of timidity|pg||
mb|1D!|an|Precision, 2+|mb|1S|nt|caitlin: indeed david|pg||
nt|Walddk4: At this point Lynch ventured a semi-psychic 1@H|pg||
nt|dburn: good for her|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easier for her to do playing Big Club|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|dburn: meanwhile, back at the bridge|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So Rigal back in it, it's not over just yet|pg||
nt|ritong: especially with +1430|pg||
nt|brolucius: When I asked Boye to explain an auction in this year's Euro championship where they had bid to 6@S missing the ace and king of trumps, he replied: 'Ah, that was a great bidding ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: problem! You must put it into the book.'  Then he explained all his thoughts to me during the bidding. A real treat.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So EW decided not to play there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=10-15|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dima:  Another potential danger|pg||
nt|caitlin: broad range |pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: quite a bit in the CR |pg||
nt|dburn: making 6@s was not so shabby for the Rigal team|pg||
nt|Walddk4: David will let us know the odds for playing the spade suit for 1 loser|pg||
nt|dburn: and without the aid of Gazzilli, the Italians might not reach it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Running the queen, David?|pg||
nt|ritong: well, an inference of the gazz is that jumps are a little bit more pure|pg||
nt|dburn: no, no|pg||
nt|dburn: that is what you do with Q10876 facing A9|pg||
nt|dburn: one might almost consider that Helgemo ventured a semi-psychic 1NT - that's quite a position with a 14 count facing two bidding opponents and one passing partner|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: He liked his 14 count; I don't blame him|pg||
nt|phil: yes but he has intermediates galore and a ttrick source|pg||
nt|caitlin: 14+ good 5 card suit no psyche in my books:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: marginal whether fredin should bother with stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@D is alerted because they would make a Support Double on all hands containing three-card spade support.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: but with a sixth card, you just play ace and another as your grandmother used to do|pg||
nt|sybarra: :) its my aunt minnie |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|casenjo:  As Henry predicted EW competed with the ghoulish distribution on board 10 and went for 800|pg||
nt|phil: but here 2@c should get you to 3N as well|pg||
nt|casenjo:  puppet stayman|pg||
nt|fabsayc: looks like this is some form of puppet stayman|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|dburn: still, no one ever doubles Helgemo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=4@H and max|pg||
nt|dima:  Well opposite 2 bidding opponents it is quite a move I would say|pg||
nt|caitlin: true|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk4: and if RHO follows with the last small card, toss a coin?|pg||
nt|dburn: absolutely, Mr Gallagher. Positively, Mr Sheen.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and on this hand doesnt matter|pg||
nt|dburn: as to whether you should bid a slam with the information Duboin has at his disposal right now...|pg||
nt|sybarra: only missing the kj,  432|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is not brain surgery |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Fred Gitelman was one of the first to point out the correctness of QT8765 opposite A9; run the Q, says a Canadian spectator (don't shoot the messenger = me)|pg||
nt|dburn: ...well, only he and the Shadow know|pg||
nt|ahollan1: note that 2@D was stayman -- all other bids from Gromov would have been natural|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|casenjo:  Meckwell has closed the gap by 1/2...down 22|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he might have tried diamond jack to gain a second entry to dummy|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dburn: nah - Fred pointed out the correctness of running the queen with Q10876 facing A9. He and I both know that with six facing two, you should play ace and one|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: a bit less fun with club lead |pg||
pc|dT|pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: KNR values it at 18, so it's not just any 14 count|pg||
nt|phil: KNR loves long strong suits and hates short honors|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dburn: not quite clear what Dubinin should do now|pg||
nt|dima:  Declarer has to be careful here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however this is probably better, tempting fleisher to cash a diamond or switch to hearts|pg||
pc|s4|nt|dburn: but this looks best|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: now if he believes diamonds 5-3 he can play hearts from hand|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|dima:  nice play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and loves Aces/Kings  hates Quacks|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|c8|nt|dburn: KNR has never been for 800 in its life. It doesn't understand these things.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

nt|joest: we will see that one in Challenge the Champs in a few years I guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|joest: yes it is quite a bit easier looking at both hands|pg||
nt|lml: my double dummy bidding is particularly good|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|lml: I can still make mistakes on play though|pg||
nt|joest: I might venture double here opposite an unpassed hand but vul opposite a passed hand I would probably chicken out|pg||
nt|joest: this is an impossible problem|pg||
nt|joest: if you bid 2@s then what?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|joest: I guess I'll find out :)|pg||
nt|lml: well I would double|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: folks I'm getting a ton of comments on the last hand.  Sorry I can't respond |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|joest: would you be happy about doubling now Linda? :)|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|lml: I would be wondering how much 3@S doubled making is|pg||
nt|joest: 730|pg||
nt|joest: I wonder if Bompis has a sense of humor|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|lml: he is obviously in your school and expects a robust doubl opposite|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: phew ... not doubled|pg||
pc|sK|nt|joest: at the other table Meck responded 1NT to the double: a reasonable compromise I think|pg||
nt|lml: this is probably as good a spot as any|pg||
nt|joest: no stoppers but shows values|pg||
nt|lml: at the 4 level|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|joest: 4@d down here off the top|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|lml: but probably just one|pg||
nt|lml: hearts would have been worse|pg||
pc|s3|nt|joest: Hamman is obviously a CHAMPION spot watcher|pg||
nt|lml: for sure|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h2|pc|s2|pg||
nt|joest: I'm guessing he'll hook the diamond and drive out the club ace|pg||
nt|lml: I think he is down one as long as he guesses things|pg||
nt|joest: this won't be so bad if his teammate makes 3@s at the other table|pg||
nt|joest: but I don't think he can|pg||
nt|joest: so it's five imps to Nickell if Bompis guesses his way out for down one|pg||

nt|ritong: a tough match for cayne s boys|pg||
mb|1N|nt|brolucius: To open 2@H on the East hand would not be a good bid. (Two side aces). Mind you, there should not really be a gap between 1@H and 2@H, so I would open 1@H.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|dburn: not that game is all that much of a contract, I guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt is unusual|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|casenjo:  Balicki made it easy for partner to beat 5 diamonds dbld on Board 12; he led a club|pg||

nt|joest: i'm guessing a low spade now|pg||
nt|lml: I think a heart|pg||
nt|joest: it would appear that Bompis gave count there but I'm not that Pilon can be sure of that.  Why can't Bompis have a doubleton?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: fingering @D, put it back|pg||
nt|lml: probably not going to make that play|pg||
nt|lml: I mean Hamman|pg||
nt|lml: but maybe knowing hearts aren t breaking he just wants to put pressure on declarers trump holding with a diamond|pg||
nt|joest: fortunate club lie that will force north to ruff with natural trump tricks|pg||

nt|joest: Hamman is homeso long as he takes the hook.  He is now afraid of an impending club ruff though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Hamman crunching count|pg||
nt|lml: he really doesnt have a count on the hand|pg||

nt|sybarra: and last bd now |pg||
nt|sybarra: and our great thx to Andy Hung,  the operator of our dreams @H |pg||
nt|brolucius: East quite rightly wanted to compete, but the choices were really a take-out double or perhaps 2NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Last here thanks all |pg||
nt|Walddk4: But they did not play :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow -- that is fast then|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Next session will start at 7:30 central time|pg||
nt|Walddk4: HH are fast, Passell too|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Obviously these guys switched around the responses, but they all work, as long as you agree|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like that better, shape is usually more important than size|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and to our many commentators  |pg||
nt|casenjo:  The next bid by opener asks|pg||
mb|1D!|an|2+|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 1N=12-15  could be 4441@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: So in about an hour and 40 mins|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess that's just a penalty double|pg||
nt|dburn: but Strul seems uneasy about it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes  vs WeakNT  DBL=Pen|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I see - Gromov's pass was artificial, and Strul wanted to know what it meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: Thanks guys, it's been a pleasure =)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I mean responder|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dburn: mind you, I don;t know what he found out about it that prompted him to do that|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: just been informed next session starts at 8|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|nt|Walddk4: 2NT on this auction is a rare bird|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk4: Time for breakfast :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I would not know what it meant|pg||
nt|ahollan1: note:  rare is a 4-letter word|pg||
nt|dburn: if I were Becker I would be a confused man by the end of this auction - ostensibly, 2NT should be a strong distributional hand that does not want to pass 1NT doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and a special thx always goes to Jan Martel for organizing the operatorts.  and to ACBL for bringing this tourney to bbo |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Strul must have taken double as conventional|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Otherwise 2NT and 3@S make no sense|pg||
nt|dburn: but Strul hasn't got one of those, so I have no idea where this will all end, except that it will all end in tears|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|dima:  sporting double?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unfortunate end to a very good set for Becker-Strul|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They are not in complete agreement on which level to play at|pg||
nt|dburn: I really am not sure about all this - Becker may have concluded that Strul is two-suited (as I would) with spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|casenjo:  The Encyclopedia of Bridge has another version. Evidently there have been several variations.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and of course to all the specs,  helpful , humorous comments |pg||
nt|fabsayc: more like 100, 10 or so i have used|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: This is the last board of the set and I'm sure we would all like to thank the splendid Asya, our special VG operator. Many thanks and well done!|pg||
nt|po-s: this looks enought|pg||
nt|Walddk4: From bad to worse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still avoiding the red card  [DBL]|pg||
nt|dburn: Strul appears to believe that Becker has some other hand than a penalty double of a weak no trump|pg||
nt|dima:  the biding is not over yet :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|Walddk4: Is this bridge, I am asked. Well, this is extremely strange|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, Jo Anne, my co-commentator. Thanks!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Last hand here thanks everyone for watching|pg||
nt|po-s: A grand seems to be too high|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dburn: Becker now hasn't got a clue what's happening, and should probably have stopped bidding|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dima:  oh well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most notable  Zaleski 99 vs Nickell 55|pg||
nt|dburn: but this is really just a misunderstanding - sad end to what has been a great effort by Strul personally; he has played some very good bridge these past two hours|pg||
nt|dima:  tough opening lead problem :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Director is being called now|pg||
nt|dburn: I thought he might be|pg||
nt|po-s: About 4 down unless he guesses wrong here and rhere|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Private messages are welcomed of course, but please don't blame ME for this disaster. I am innocent|pg||
nt|po-s: I don´t think EW should complain|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Or me!|pg||
nt|dburn: because there must have been something in Dubinin's explanation of Gromov's pass to 1NT doubled that caused Strul to go off in this wild and woolly fashion|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This does not even qualify as a Roland slam, so leave me out of it|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly Gromov's pass was alerted, but I do not know what explanation Strul had - Becker would have had the right one, but that would not help him much|pg||
nt|po-s: with a good hand or some escape start|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you should probably consider the scores on bridgewinners  unofficial for a while|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: scores filtering in   http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: South might not have seen the 1nt alreat?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Berkowitz-Cohen have had much success and can find out just about anything below game|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|vugraphzfe: Dont know really|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Yes they are upest with the 1nt bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: worst ever was rubber bridge slam where defense scored added insult by collecting 100 honors|pg||
nt|po-s: Ah, they did reach seven after all|pg||
nt|dburn: well, whatever Strul leared from the director (or from the situation in general) has caused him to believe that if someone's going to go a lot off in something, it should be ...|pg||
nt|dburn: partner and not himself|pg||
nt|dima:  it is also the best combined fit|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzfe: I was just correcting the result to -5, instead of -4, and wanted to put the full auction in so it would be there|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d9|nt|Walddk4: Indeed it is|pg||

nt|brolucius: to know that he is human!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: About 4 and a half hours|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: interesting choice between 1NT and 2@d there|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yes lots of comments and interesting ideas from all the kibbitzers|pg||
nt|joest: Meckwell of course bid their heads off in the open room and competed to 3@d|pg||
nt|lml: yes there are more boards coming after a break|pg||
pc|d6|nt|joest: this looks headed for down one|pg||

nt|joest: so Meckstroth will need tomake 3@d which looks a stretch|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c8|nt|lml: but east-west doesnt have enough tricks without giving up a black trick|pg||
pc|s4|nt|joest: so it will be a 25+ imp lead for Zaleski headed for the final 16 boards|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

nt|joest: Hamman has to weaken hishand in some way here|pg||
