mb|p|nt|babs59: This looks like 6C makes for EW, so perhaps 4HX was a good save|pg||

mb|p|nt|mr murray: oops|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: 5D failed in the other room when North failed to establish the club suit before tackling the trumps|pg||
nt|babs59: hence she lost control when the trumps were 4-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: looks wrongsided but wont matter|pg||
pc|dT|nt|babs59: however, I believe if you first lead the @DA then finesse the clubs, 5@D should make|pg||
nt|babs59: South's 2@s bid was just GF - either agreeing a minor or looking for 3NT|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|babs59: board 8  the possible double game swing hand (though EW went -1 in 4H) was the swing, with NS making 4S|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|babs59: well the response is DKC, but I wouldn't bank on South's 4D being that for sure on this auction|pg||
nt|mamos:  yes my parts and i agree to pass all 4333 eight counts opposite 15-17 (or almost all :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|babs59: so this hand is a potential big gain for NSW, if played correctly|pg||
nt|babs59: and our last hand of this set too|pg||
nt|nickf: I'd be bidding 6D now|pg||
nt|babs59: thanks Mike and Nick - and what time do we re-start?|pg||
nt|nickf: oh sorry 4D was KC|pg||
nt|nickf: let me check|pg||

nt|nickf: oh OK, good idea|pg||
nt|nickf: let me try that|pg||
nt|nickf: bad planning to start 5 boards apart!|pg||
nt|babs59: for us anyway|pg||
nt|mamos:  EW pleased to have a plus score|pg||
nt|mamos:  may feel a change is due|pg||
nt|mamos:  4@S is possible contract but @h ruff looms|pg||
mb|1D|nt|nickf: we might see a game on this hand|pg||
nt|mamos:  NS seem likely to reach 4@S or perhaps even Diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: no we have played this board|pg||
nt|nickf: redeal to c1|pg||
nt|mr murray: 4 diamonds down 1 = maximum|pg||
nt|mr murray: 4 spades great spot for n-s|pg||
nt|mr murray: but vulnberability may make them give up|pg||
mb|1H|nt|nickf: ooh that's bright|pg||
nt|oliverc: EW will be competing to 4@H, for sure|pg||
nt|nickf: 2S may bury the NS spades now|pg||
nt|nickf: need some system here|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|nickf: now Kalmin will need to act over 4H|pg||
nt|babs59: though the 2D was not alerted, it was a multi 2 - showing a weak 2 in hearts or spades (maybe a strong 2NT option)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|babs59: thus 2S says Pass if 2S, correct if you have hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|nickf: operator|pg||
nt|oliverc: that doesn't look right|pg||
nt|nickf: is this auction right?|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: I must confess, With the West hand I'd have been bidding 4@H rather than 3|pg||
nt|mamos:  home now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|oliverc: Since 2@S normally shows game interest in @H|pg||
nt|babs59: I'd also be bidding 4H with East, at the very least to stop NS coming in easily|pg||
nt|oliverc: quite|pg||
pc|dK|nt|oliverc: but they've got away with it  -  just need to take the right view in @H|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|s4|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||

pc|sK|nt|oliverc: not now|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|mr murray: trick bid of 1 heart really hurt them on this board|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|babs59: seems reasonable as a line, based on the lack of bidding by NS though|pg||
nt|babs59: I'd be playing for 1-1 on that basis|pg||
nt|mamos:  the vulnerability prvented North from bidding @Ds but might have defeted contract|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|nickf: sure, how on earth could there be 5 spades and heart void in South?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|oliverc: quite easily :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|oliverc: Since the points herely level, would South be coming in at the 3-level with a wasted|pg||
