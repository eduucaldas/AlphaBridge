mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes indeed. Do we agree with 3@C?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very difficult at pairs. At teams, -800 against -650 is no big deal. Disastrous at pairs|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Right, I mean would 2@C or 4@C be better than 3?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: its always a hard decision to open more than 3@C since you bypass 3NT and at that point West could have had a good hand|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it was an overcall|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||

nt|mdgraham: you could try 3@H (I've got a solid suit, do you have a heart stop) but you would usually have a couple of bits outside your solid suit |pg||

nt|Walddk2: 5@H or not, that is the question|pg||

nt|lml: the problem with the second double is they may end in clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I would do that with 4 hearts and 5 clubs, not the other way round|pg||

nt|iceking: but this time Roland S had a typical hand to bid 2club fallowed by 3d |pg||
nt|haans: normal bidding to pass the way for artificial style|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe one should treat it as balanced and show 25+ without bypassing 2NT|pg||
