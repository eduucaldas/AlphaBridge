mb|4S|nt|caitlin: our operator|pg||

nt|Walddk6: Andy is really good as he is operating in two rooms according to the profiles|pg||
nt|caitlin: lol|pg||
nt|athene: south might bid 4nt intending to raise 5minor to six|pg||
nt|coolvijay: but not after 4@s...|pg||
nt|athene: it's not easy - she doesn't know her partner has SEVEN fitting honours|pg||
nt|coolvijay: will Breed be bold enough to bid 5@s|pg||
nt|anamtebha: she will not bid 5@s|pg||
nt|coolvijay: 4nt seems the bid coming in..|pg||
nt|anamtebha: that would imply @s first rd for them|pg||
nt|athene: you don't want to bid slam on this sort of auction, lose @SA and a slow diamond, and make opps happy about pre-empting you|pg||
nt|anamtebha: because 4n take/out is avail|pg||
nt|athene: most experts are happier scoring up 620 in 5@C+1|pg||
nt|coolvijay: true...|pg||
nt|anamtebha: its not hard to bid 6 here tho. S is going to play witha 30 pt deck|pg||
nt|caitlin: indeed|pg||
mb|5N|nt|athene: i don't know that it's that easy - wouldn't the bidding have gone the same if east had the @DQ?|pg||
nt|anamtebha: Letizia is knownfor her t/o dbls. she wouldnt give value to any @s she might hold usually|pg||
nt|coolvijay: if N is bidding 5@c over 4nt.... S can still bid 5@s then...|pg||

mb|p|nt|coolvijay: well bid |pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: east even with a very pure hand doesn't sacrifice - 6@C only has to be going down a small percentage of the time to make 6@S a very bad bid|pg||

mb|4N|an|RKC|mb|p|mb|5C|an|0 or 3|nt|caitlin: @D music to n's ears|pg||

mb|p|mb|5D|nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|athene: yes, on a heart lead it's 5 or 7, pretty much - maybe not quite because diamonds might be 4-1|pg||

nt|coolvijay: i presume 5@d was trump queen ask|pg||
pc|cA|nt|caitlin: what?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: you would expect south to bid 6@D over 5@D, showing @SQ+@DK|pg||
nt|anamtebha: she implied a singleton @d imo. over 5@d she would normally bid 6@d|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|sQ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|coolvijay: so 6@d shld have been the bid i guess|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: maybe she felt 4@D had already shown it so 6@D would show @DKQ|pg||
nt|Walddk6: "should have" is perhaps an overbid as we don't know their methods|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think 4@D should be a shortage because south should splinter over 2@S with that hand|pg||

pc|s7|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|cT|pg||

nt|athene: maybe NS have the agreement that a splinter promises four trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|anamtebha: yes they do|pg||
nt|anamtebha: and over 2@c splinters are usually just space consuming. its just as easy to show the singleton as a control to check for other suits|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: i think they must, otherwise south would have bid 4@C over 2@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|athene: i would bid 3nt with north's hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|c9|nt|athene: you would rather be declarer to have the lead run up to those minor-suit queens, but you can't have everything |pg||
nt|anamtebha: also Qxx in both minors are tempting|pg||
nt|coolvijay: now we have the scores....|pg||
nt|coolvijay: both slams missed in the other room...|pg||
nt|caitlin: no stayman as athene saying with 4-3-3-3  3-4-3-3  no ruffing values|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north should respond 1nt, in fact - if you are going to bury three-card support for partner, why not bury the spades too and really enjoy yourself? :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|anamtebha: you dont want to skip 4@s here|pg||
nt|anamtebha: if partner has 4@s too you do not want to be in 3n|pg||
nt|anamtebha: so 1@s is mandatory|pg||
nt|athene: east might win and return a diamond, going for the instant knockout - @DA with partner|pg||
nt|caitlin: nice eraly lead by Westheimer......surprisedDinkin missed 2 slams|pg||
nt|coolvijay: 4@h seems a safe contract with Qx in clubs|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: she can see the heart finesse is working, so the only chance to beat has to be @DAx with partner|pg||

nt|athene: but east correctly just played @CA, club|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: interesting situation - if east had returned a spade at trick 2 and west had found the diamond lead, declarer would have been forced into the heart finesse, and made 10 or 11|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|athene: north has a monster for this 1@H :) compared with her last third-hand escapade|pg||
mb|2N|an|Limit Raise|mb|p|nt|athene: many people would get very excited with west's hand, with a singleton heart, but it's not that great|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: having matching singleton with partner is bad news  - there's no ruffs and you lose slow tricks in suits all over the place|pg||
pc|h9|nt|anamtebha: this will play well. theres no @s guess with a @c exit|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can't really lose five tricks here|pg||
nt|athene: even though it looks as though she might lose two tricks in spades and diamonds, with a misguess|pg||
nt|athene: but if she loses two tricks in diamonds that gives a spade pitch from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: actually perhaps it's not that simple because she might play spades, intending to try to throw a diamond from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: suppose it goes @S to @SJ, then west can win @SA and bash diamond through before the discard|pg||
nt|anamtebha: she wont play on @ss before she does @cs|pg||
nt|athene: the two suits are totally symmetric as far as i can see - you just have a guess which one to play, don't you?|pg||
