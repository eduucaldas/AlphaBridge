nt|Walddk4: Hi all|pg||
nt|pelu: in Open Beatty-Jacobs are NS - the 3. pair on the team are Bocchi-ferraro, Italy|pg||
nt|dima:  Hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Peter Lund, Bill Frisby and Dima Nikolenkov|pg||
nt|athene: hello good evening everyone|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps it was a bad idea to pre-empt with west's very balanced hand - it might push opps into a making 4@S they weren't going to bid on their own|pg||
nt|dima:  So some action with a Polish club I suppose on the board N1|pg||
nt|athene: but i am not sure south will feel able to bid that 5-card suit yet again :)|pg||
nt|dima:  Well Apolinary might guess that partner is short in @h, but how many @s will he have?|pg||
nt|dima:  Certainly not 3 (would raise) ...|pg||
nt|pelu: with all suit almost 3-3, only a @s-lead can defeat 4@S|pg||
nt|dima:  Actually 4@h bid now as DO SMTH clever could be ok :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores for half time scores|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|athene: yes, you can often use a cue-bid as a choice of games bid in this sort of situation|pg||
nt|dima:  Discipline won|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|dima:  And it is clear even if undiscussed since 3@s was nonforcing|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dima:  Well looks like first blood to Jacobs (4 IMPs)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|athene: perhaps south should just have passed 3@H out - his partner, known to be short in hearts, didn't act over 3@H, so must be very weak|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: not easy though with three small facing the assumed singleton|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|frankaus: fasinating collection here|pg||

mb|3N|nt|sybarra: or should I say "yuck" |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: the good old reversed two suiters|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No-one can double 3NT but it sure is a terrible contract|pg||
nt|frankaus: play missfits in 3NT is a common view|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: each player would rather have another pard,  if they could see all cards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: With clubs 3-2 it has *some* play, but this is awful|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to duck the @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that is easy |pg||
nt|frankaus: duboin did well to stay out of the action|pg||
nt|sybarra: your rightie opens you best suit,  easy to stay out |pg||
nt|frankaus: red light helped|pg||
nt|ritong: so this is a matter of number of undertricks|pg||
nt|frankaus: 50's :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: as pointed out to me,  then your lefty bids you next best suit,  |pg||
nt|sybarra: how does it feel now?|pg||
nt|ritong: going down less than your counterpart is also a way to win imps ( homer nods)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: hi all, not so easy on a club lead|pg||
nt|dima:  Very tough to find even against polish club|pg||
nt|pelu: EIGHT mARTIN - A @C-LEAD WILL DEFEAT - BUT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the suit has really never been bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: current scores at http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the horrible breaks make this unlikely to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: east's rebid highlights something that few if any club players seem to discuss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 2/1, what does opener need to make a "high level reverse"   i.e. bid 3 of new suit, without jump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some say always 5 of 2nd suit, some always extras, some require both, some require neither|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pelu: sorry Caps lock :(:(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other than that -- it is pretty standard :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: there are many copies of WBF CC for Lauria-Versace online -- check ecatsbridge.com under either the latest European Championship or the 2009 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|dima:  But declarer still have some loosing options|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=max, 4@H   3@D=retransfer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ouch|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|warrens:  this makes 7 Hearts with everything breaking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does anybody know EW system|pg||
nt|warrens:  take 2 @H ruffs in the W hand|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|irwinbo: they should get there now|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, I meant 2 @D ruffs :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i assume 1H showed spades, but the rest is a mystery|pg||
nt|fabsayc: undoubtedly every bid so far an alert|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pelu: oh no|pg||
pc|h5|pc|cA|nt|dima:  oops|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i love it. first non alert was 7@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if the other room will also be plagued by this misfit|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: both majors probably need to break, so this is only around 55% contract|pg||
nt|warrens:  I got disconnected, but this slam is not too bad a % because you have the spots in spades and hearts, but not much better than 50%, which is not enough for 980 vs. 1510 or -50.  +11 or -14 imps|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pelu: he found the loosing line :)|pg||
nt|athene: playing for a third club trick isn't bad odds with that suit, a priori|pg||
pc|s5|nt|henryb:  I suspect he was afraid of 5-3 diamonds or the overcaller having both high hearts|pg||
nt|dima:  this would win on any 3-3 or H singleton or doubleton by West|pg||
nt|athene: 3-3 break or catching a doubleton club honour with west|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: playing hearts towards the @HQJ works better of course but declarer might be thinking west is very likely to hold @HAK since he hasn't got much of a spade suit|pg||
nt|dima:  If @d are 5-3 then heart honor position is not relevant, no?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: excellent point from a few specs --  maybe Versace isn't worth game force 2@H|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: 1@S-1nt-2@D-3@C all pass for the pessimists|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d3|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|nt|athene: yes, diamonds 5-3 is another reason to play clubs instead|pg||
nt|henryb:  correct; so this might well look like the most promising line on the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but science and 66 hands don't really mix well|pg||

nt|dburn: not quite sure why the final contract was doubled at the other table - sure, South opened the bidding, but even so...|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: and indeed we have beaten this to death,   |pg||
nt|Walddk4: It would also be unwise as the defence can't come to more than 1 heart, 2 diamonds and 1 club|pg||

nt|fabsayc: actually they play a pretty simple system relative to other top level players|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even worse -- LV may play east rebids 1@S-1N//3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: identical auction in Open Room -- no surprise|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|dima:  So without doing much wrong Markowicz teams looks at substantial deficit after 2 boards|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S puts a lot of pressure on east - i certainly wouldn't want to pass this out with his hand|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: 5@H looks the normal action|pg||
mb|2N|nt|dima:  Money for NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: as Martin posted earlier -- halftime scores for Spingold online at http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that site doesn't have Wagar [Ladies] results and last time i checked neither did the ACBL site|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|athene: north even with a spade fit of course just takes the money|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: wow, you cant steal from bocchi|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dima:  I think every redblooded bridge player would bid with East hand ... but I've been wrong before :)|pg||
nt|athene: 4-3-3-3 hands aren't meant to bid 5 over 5 with, especially when you have all your strength in defensive tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  The question is really whether 4@s is normal. If not, then this may be a win for Markowitz|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS are playing a Big Club with Variable NT   so 1@D=nebulous|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: Martin - do you know anything more about the NS system?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: speculative double|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|pelu: so looks like 800 +50 for Jacobs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no marcinski is from far away, Poland i think|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|dima:  4@s does look a bit offbeat to me with 7222|pg||
nt|athene: i like 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: often good to pretend to be weak defensively when you are not|pg||
nt|athene: in my experience when one table opens 1major and the other opens 4, the one who opened high almost always gains|pg||
nt|pelu: green against red - OK for me|pg||
nt|dima:  Markowicz is back in the match|pg||
nt|fabsayc: at this vuls i check in the dark when partner opens 4@S :)|pg||
nt|athene: north's correct action over 4@S is not just to pass, but to pass instantly, looking bored|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S = 7 playing tricks - thats almost the S-hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: same as check in the dark :)|pg||
nt|po-s: agree - AK of hearts to deal with Jxxx with North - not played to best advantage|pg||
nt|harmon: no he lives in montreal|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|caitlin: Hi folks|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|henryb:  Klukowski was surprisingly passive at the other table: overcalled 3@h and then passed throughout|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm that's a strange switch, though|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he has got busy for no reason however|pg||
nt|athene: why not just cash your hearts and exit a spade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cash hearts, exit spades was the indicated defense|pg||
nt|fabsayc: must be right, we agree|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he was playing his partner for a singleton or void diamond|pg||

nt|fabsayc: including team rosters, check yesterday results for todays spingold matchups|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i bet a lot of people will be examining the hand after the set|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|athene: yes, he would be unlikely to play south for @SAK and a side ace as well, i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: todays scores at http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Especially seeing @c Q coming down so it is not even close to a guess|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|athene: 3nt likely to make here, but a million losers in the 6-2 spade fit|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: need good methods here to avoid 4@S|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pelu: in OR EW stopped in the "impossible" contract: 2NT (in teams)|pg||
nt|dima:  I think 3NT denies 4@h and 3@s|pg||
nt|dima:  So the spotlight is on Tarek Sadek|pg||
nt|henryb:  I see four of them. Where are the other 999,996?|pg||
nt|athene: west will be worried that his hand simply isn't enough help if spades aren't trumps...he doesn't know about his partner's secret weapon (diamond trick source)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still 3@D is a bit sounder, i would be worried about hearts with east hand|pg||

pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: it helps to leave partner room to bid his hand, and that is another reason for 3@D|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|athene: most people play 1x - 1y; 3NT as long solid or nearly solid suit with some stoppers|pg||

nt|athene: i think West in the other room took a very odd view to pass 2nt - it's unlikely to be the right spot when you have that hand|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he didn't have the methods to stop in 3@S, which he might have wanted to do|pg||

nt|fabsayc: ok the 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe we should say  odds favor West holding @HJ rather than @HAK|pg||
nt|casenjo:  if jack of hearts is onside he is unbeatable, offside they still have time to find the club ace|pg||
nt|casenjo:  the only winning hold is for Lauria to have AK tight|pg||
nt|casenjo:  but the Jack is still onside|pg||
nt|casenjo:  or.....west could have AK43???|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: so after a start will big swings we now exp 3 flat boards|pg||
nt|athene: declarer automatically keeps the trumps fluid - of course he is never going to want to lead the @S7 to his @S8|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|casenjo:  and play for stiff jack? those percentages stink|pg||
nt|ahollan1: could?  sure    but odds against|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Well, the % calculator is stillworking, but slowly :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4-1 split less likely than 3-2   then within 4-1 only 1 case where East has singleton J|pg||
nt|casenjo:  like I said, those % stink|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i guess there may be entry complications, at least that is what declarer was checking|pg||

nt|fabsayc: might work here though, keep opponents out of 5@D|pg||
nt|dima:  Let's see how it works if it gets back at 5@d :)|pg||
nt|athene: west might transfer to diamonds intending to rebid 3@C if given the chance|pg||

pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: which ace next?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the italians play  Versace DBL as 4+@S   so  1m-(1H)-1@S = 0-3@S [like a negative double without @S]|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: he's hoping to find his partner with the miracle @HAK @SK so the majors run|pg||
nt|casenjo:  West might not have liked North's bids due to tempo or something else, but once south bids 2 spades, North knows he is on a maximum and can see game, the question is 3NTor 4 hearts|pg||

nt|ahollan1: was it explained or just seen?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  This has turned into a very cool auction, because if they end up in spades North's king of hearts is protected and that is their only weakness|pg||
nt|casenjo:  So, North can play 6 spades or 6NT|pg||
mb|6N|nt|fabsayc: 2@D must be the ferraro convention :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: playing a strong club people often use various 2-level bids to show minor-suit hands, otherwise the 1@D opener just gets too overloaded - it can end up being almost anything|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|athene: 11 tricks likely, thanks to the 3-3 spades|pg||

nt|caitlin: Dorothy Truscott|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  i think Truscott was already in the US when he did write-up of Bobby Jordan's convention -- but i've been told that Albert Dormer might have also invented the convention|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: the reason is maybe that opening 1nt confers more of a tactical advantage than overcalling 1nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the italian pairs we see on vugraph use a lot of DBL to show extras - regardless of shape   so it is unclear if that is what Versace is doing or if his is a form of takeout|pg||

nt|casenjo:  :)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  don't we all|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: 6 on with a likely guess in diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: except in NT|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|dima:  depends a bit on the style of partnership :)|pg||
nt|athene: balanced 9 count responds 1nt to a 1@S overcall doesn't it?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: shouldn't be too hard for NS to cash their four tricks if EW reach 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfg: a ruling was made changing board 23 to 3H making 4|pg||
pc|sT|nt|caitlin: no passes here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: an auction without passes is not an auction|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dima:  I would say so :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: ferraro expecting extras for 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: he has a pretty good hand - even facing a minimum opener it might come home|pg||
nt|fabsayc: because his partner a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: this is a situation where south might think about showing three hearts so his partner doesn't try for a trump promotion|pg||
nt|fabsayc: trumps promotion would require an unlikely J10x in south in spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and still would not suffice unless south had club ace|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: Duboin stopped in 2@S on 43|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|dima:  Over 2@c North could maybe try 2@d followed by 3@c or something of this sort|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|c8|nt|athene: north might be wondering whether to switch to a club - i.e. cash @CA, then back to @HK and another heart for trump promo|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|dburn: meanwhile, back at the bridge|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So Rigal back in it, it's not over just yet|pg||
nt|ritong: especially with +1430|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: quite a bit in the CR |pg||
nt|dburn: making 6@s was not so shabby for the Rigal team|pg||
nt|Walddk4: David will let us know the odds for playing the spade suit for 1 loser|pg||
nt|dburn: and without the aid of Gazzilli, the Italians might not reach it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Running the queen, David?|pg||
nt|ritong: well, an inference of the gazz is that jumps are a little bit more pure|pg||
nt|dburn: no, no|pg||
nt|dburn: that is what you do with Q10876 facing A9|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|dburn: but with a sixth card, you just play ace and another as your grandmother used to do|pg||
nt|sybarra: :) its my aunt minnie |pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: and if RHO follows with the last small card, toss a coin?|pg||
nt|dburn: absolutely, Mr Gallagher. Positively, Mr Sheen.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and on this hand doesnt matter|pg||
nt|dburn: as to whether you should bid a slam with the information Duboin has at his disposal right now...|pg||
nt|sybarra: only missing the kj,  432|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is not brain surgery |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Fred Gitelman was one of the first to point out the correctness of QT8765 opposite A9; run the Q, says a Canadian spectator (don't shoot the messenger = me)|pg||
nt|dburn: ...well, only he and the Shadow know|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: nah - Fred pointed out the correctness of running the queen with Q10876 facing A9. He and I both know that with six facing two, you should play ace and one|pg||

nt|fabsayc: if the clubs were frozen i dont see a way be beat hand, so really think this defense was wrong|pg||
nt|dburn: well, Ornstein didn't know who could make what, but I guess he figured that if his partner didn't have enough aces for him to make 6@s, maybe the opponents did for them to make 6@h|pg||
nt|casenjo:  the contract in the other room is 5 clubs|pg||
mb|1C|nt|dima:  4 top tricks + Qxx in partner's expected 6-card suit looks really good|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H!|nt|pelu: OR still on board 9 :(:(|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|athene: north should really know his partner can't be screaming for a diamond, can he? i suppose it's just barely possible that south has a diamond void?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|dima:  Well if you play 4@s there you DO take your time :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: that would give him about 15 clubs|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: east close to a 3@H rebid there, but singleton ace isn't so great|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: PASS probably shows 2@S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: and if he has anything except a void, you don't need or want to attack diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|caitlin: again......did anyone know who was sacing?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL = re-transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the lasts time 1@H was a 4432 10 count -- so can't extrapolate anything from this hand|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Cayne gained 10 IMPS on the ruling change of board 23|pg||
nt|casenjo:  with the friendly lie of the spades there are 12 tricks to be had on this hand|pg||
mb|4N|nt|dima:  I would probably be swayed by 109 of @h to rebid 3@h. |pg||
nt|fabsayc: and 3c?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C = transfer  4+@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: really?|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: no double?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep -- 2nd round transfers on the rise in the US too  immeditely coming to mind  Levin-Weinstein|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|casenjo:  duboin has just gone down in 5 clubs|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: possibility of a swing - if east does rebid 3@H they might reach slam in the other room|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|caitlin: there is that psychological factor as to whom one doubles|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: the oswald jacoby syndrome?|pg||
nt|dburn: and even if partner does, a double might give away the show|pg||
nt|dburn: or lead to down one doubled when you will get down two undoubled|pg||
pc|h7|nt|casenjo:  with 4 boards to go, Cayne is holding a 20 imp lead|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|pelu: again 12 tricks - this time on 2 finess out of 2 :)|pg||
nt|athene: NS have lots of big cards on this one but no trick source, so it's aggressive to look for slam|pg||
nt|athene: it's a bit better than needing two finesses|pg||
nt|dima:  4@s denied slam interest I believe|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: actually maybe not|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|athene: if the spades come in for no losers you can lead towards the @CJ|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: then you make with the @CQ right or 3-3 clubs or diamond finesse on|pg||
nt|caitlin: doubtful 10 on last hand.....has to give up lead before 10|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: your home if spades 3-2, king onside|pg||
nt|athene: if there is a spade loser you maybe need @CQx|pg||
nt|fabsayc: doubleton king i mean|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this lead gives extra chances|pg||
nt|athene: there is also the chance of getting a friendly lead like a diamond|pg||
nt|dima:  Yes covering with the 7 will bring smile|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: if south's 2@H bid identified both his suits, then west could probably bid clubs non-forcing but it's harder if 2@H is just spades and a minor|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d4|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now what, sort of in wrong hand|pg||
nt|pelu: no fast entry to hand now - why not @SQ?|pg||
nt|athene: hard to get back to hand without disturbing some suit that is better left intact|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: he was likely planning to balance with 3@C if given a chance|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: yes, with the @S8 in hand you would think declarer could perhaps lead the queen first time|pg||

nt|athene: he has 4333; it's not a bad shot|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the hearts dont bother me but the two unstopped suits do|pg||
nt|dima:  Defence tends to miscount/misplace cards|pg||
nt|dima:  Equivalent to 1NT (weak) - 3NT but one might consider positional values ...|pg||
nt|pelu: or he is still a little shaken after the misplay in 6@s|pg||
nt|athene: admittedly, north perhaps hasn't got a hand which can double a notrump :) but he doubled anyway|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D even if not forcing should show values|pg||
