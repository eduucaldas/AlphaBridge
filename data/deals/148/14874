nt|fabsayc: always play the lady|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: She did. She now is contemplating what to play from her hand.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since 4@H in the other room, Palmer in good position.  it seems she should be able to untangle 9, but if not surely 8 tricks are available|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and with match this close -- every 2 imps counts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Kennedy is the only one who won't feel endplayed at some point|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: although 10 would be 1 bid most of the time|pg||
