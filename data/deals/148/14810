nt|mich-b: Also , 2@D as a response to 2@C majors can be used as a light invitation in @Ss|pg||
nt|andyv:  trick is to get to game on this hand for EW|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mich-b: you bid 2@D and 2@S over partner's expected 2@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|psridhar: E here will bid game on stayman i thk -assuming that 1nt is 15-17|pg||

nt|psridhar: the finesse for trump 10 has to be first round of trumps..so a guess|pg||

nt|psridhar: if S.Ali had ducked the first trump , wd declarer have continued a 2nd trump?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I imagine game would be in the low 30% range|pg||
nt|mich-b: yes, but the bidding was normal , and one would expect the other table to bid it too|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|andyv:  with no fit established, 2@h is very aggressive with the S cards|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@C is a slight overbid in my opinion. Do we know if 2@H is game-forcing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If it is, 3@C is OK of course|pg||
nt|andyv:  whether is is or not, they are there|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: if 2h and 3c are overbids, how about 4c -unilaterally crossing 3nt?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andyv:  S's entire hand was an overbid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In Indonesia, US$15,000 = IDR150.000.000 is BIG money, I am told|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: It's peanuts if you play in the IPL, PS|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|psridhar: but this 4h will fetch a better result than 3n d3 other room|pg||
nt|mich-b: He didnt have good options over pd's 3@D ... 3@H shows 6 ..3@S shows 2 ..|pg||
nt|mich-b: thats assuming 3@D was 4sf rather than natural|pg||
nt|psridhar: 15000 $ is big money for me |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but I was referring to the IPL|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Indian Premier League (cricket)|pg||

nt|buffytvs: especially if Ross takes a bid here|pg||
mb|2D|mb|3C|nt|buffytvs: presumably that's a txfr|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|lml: I am sure it is|pg||
nt|guppy: well - 3N is even better than than 5m and Piotr found the winning initial action (1N vs. X) to steer them there|pg||
nt|lml: 5@H is a decent save or 5@C|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive at a partscore. Hard for EW to see there nice fit at @C|pg||
nt|rodal f: No @C play. Ruff a @S and a @D.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lml: 5@D|pg||
nt|lml: either|pg||
nt|buffytvs: tough call for East now|pg||
nt|lml: With those trump I bet he bids on|pg||
nt|lml: if partner has diamonds it looks like he only has 2.5 losers|pg||
nt|buffytvs: a full 18 with a diamond fit, but does he want to commit to 11 tricks?|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|lml: well that will be a steal then|pg||
nt|buffytvs: thgouht he might dbl|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|lml: I think he should bid|pg||
mb|5C|nt|lml: if partner has nothing else he has good diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: But might S will be in after a @H lead. Then 10|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: avoiding the Elvis Coup in diamonds, which as it happens, doesn't cost|pg||
nt|lml: maybe he didnt think clubs was a transfer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he had even better clubs|pg||
nt|lml: otherwise that is sort of a strange lead|pg||
nt|buffytvs: what would you have led from his hand?|pg||
nt|lml: the elvis coup|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: keith is looking for some high cards|pg||
nt|buffytvs: me too|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|buffytvs: there's a 10 :)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lml: fortunately he doesnt need to get to dummy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Playable now.|pg||
nt|rodal f: brb|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pc|d8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lml: 2@H over 1NT doesnt have to show much but Taylor's hand was less than not much|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|lml: now Piotrk nows the diamond position|pg||
nt|lml: and the club position and the heart position....|pg||
nt|rodal f: b|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c3|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lml: so this is a potential pickup for Korbel |pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|buffytvs: yes - but it wouldn't shock me if they pushed the board|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think it's hard to bid 5@D EW|pg||
mc|10|nt|rodal f: Was the trap. @S was needed anyway. Why not @S?|pg||
pg||
qx|c18|st||md|4SKT5HATDAQ952CQ43,SAJ8732HJ62DK74C2,S4H987DJ86CJT9865,SQ96HKQ543DT3CAK7|sv|n|nt|buffytvs: they might get 3 IMPs procedural penalty,but that's a bit tacky|pg||
nt|lml: that reaffirms my view that Piotrk may have thought it was clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: What happend?:)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|buffytvs: true|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can't be correct. 1@H opening.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lml: Piotr|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|lml: I can see no reason for any penalty... they got it all..|pg||
nt|guppy: his choice of opening lead (@cA) also strongly suggested same|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yes we discussed that a while ago|pg||
nt|lml: but welcome :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: I guess 2NT shows a heart raise of some sort|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|lml: thanks !|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|buffytvs: the C!A is a disappointment to declarer -- it's a trick, but he'd far rather have the @DK for example|pg||
nt|buffytvs: @CA|pg||
nt|lml: true but there is enough to work with in dummy|pg||
nt|buffytvs: oh yes|pg||
nt|lml: this may take a while though|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|buffytvs: he could play this as a dummy reversal|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|lml: I think he will just set up diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: probably about now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: seems simplest|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|lml: definitely about now!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he might well guess the diamond position seeing the 9 fall|pg||
nt|lml: I am certain he will guess the position but I am usually wrong|pg||
nt|lml: he knows the spade honors are likely split and Piotr has 0-6 so there isnt much room for diamond honors|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- good point about the spades|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|buffytvs: as predicted|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: If you ask Michael Rosenberg which suit to open, he will reply "Yes"|pg||

nt|mich-b: so this must be another weak 2 for West?|pg||
nt|psridhar: now he has another 'normal' weak 2h !|pg||
nt|andyv:  this may be too strong|pg||
nt|mich-b: actually much better than the previous one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are in Jakarta, the capital and largest city of Indonesia on the island of Java. Population around 8.5 million, 12th largest in the world|pg||
nt|mich-b: better vulnerability ... dealer (and not 2nd as before) , and no 4 card major on the side|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h does have excellent play|pg||
nt|psridhar: they will get there certainly if he opens 2h|pg||
mb|p|nt|mich-b: ...as does 4@S for NS...|pg||

nt|Walddk2: The famous 5-0 fit|pg||
nt|psridhar: E didnt hv landy avble? strange|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nasty break, 6-2|pg||
nt|mich-b: Surprised to see that East did not have a way to show majors over 1NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  if E was showing the majors, that would have kept S out of it too|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  somehow, the E hand doesn't look like a 2@s bid|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is some violation of Burn's Law. "As declarer, you should aim at having more trumps than the opponents"|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|s3|pc|h3|pg||
nt|psridhar: this hand also throws up an interesting variation of Burns law- your side's longest trump length should exceed that of either opponent|pg||
nt|andyv:  it may turn out to be ok for EW as NS can probably make game in @ss|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|psridhar: NS may not have got there|pg||
nt|mich-b: I think making 4@H by EW is more likely than making 4@S by NS|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psridhar: and E in other room may show his majors and get 4h|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|andyv:  even if they didn't, they'd probably go +170... so the loss is minimum at best|pg||
nt|mich-b: NS would be likely to lose 1@H , 1@C , 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is definitely out of the question if East shows both majors|pg||
nt|andyv:  right|pg||
nt|mich-b: ...... while 4@H is very much in the picture|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe E goes by the rule that the lower major should be as long or longer to do that|pg||
nt|mich-b: 5-4 in the majors is very normal|pg||
nt|andyv:  no argument here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can't live without 2@C as both majors after 1NT|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mich-b: I am sure it is correct to show both majors (with 5-4) rather than your 5 card suit|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, if E had a 5 card major, that would be one thing|pg||
nt|psridhar: i expect Landy to be popular and EW will get to 3h/4h , so Muldya will lose big on this bd|pg||
nt|mich-b: Agreed , Roland .. and 2@C as majors is better than 2@D as majors|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: absolutely|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|d9|pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: because you have 2@D available to ask for the longer|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|mich-b: yes , exactly|pg||
mc|4|nt|andyv:  down 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  will be interesting to see what the damage is|pg||
