mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|josj: interesting 1NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: By the re X from S @C was told. So 2@S ok as I see it.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here is a Roland grand.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. @S was told*|pg||
nt|jcwla: I like NT auctions as much as anyone, but this 1NT seems a needless distortion.|pg||
nt|josj: but 6@C is quite decent|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mamos:  misfit|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: yes but a sound contract.|pg||
nt|don_kapu: look like 3nt -1 from 4@D and 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: The web page for the turney: http://www.gabrial-ui.com/|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT e/w makes on guessing the spade position     |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Friendly placement of cards for the contract but 4@H imo a better contract.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos:  some communication issues|pg||

nt|rodal f: b|pg||
nt|jcwla: Good pace so far.|pg||
nt|josj: yes, that would be the normal way to do it in Indonesia|pg||
nt|mcarroll: For a start in this session, a marginal @C slam will be played in a peaceful 3NT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Well played - I hope|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: n/s likely to play 3NT|pg||
nt|don_kapu: Pass - Pass - Pass - and silalahi will bid ??|pg||
nt|josj: yesterday and this morning all teams played a Swiss for 7 rounds; the top 8 qualify for a round robin that finishes tomorrow afternoon|pg||
nt|mcarroll: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: east west have 2 adventages . they have the major major and the cards lie well for them|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lml: oh and one more ... among their advantages is the vulnerability|pg||
nt|mamos:  NS turn for 3NT|pg||
nt|garnetts: Whatever that 2@S means its not my idea of a weak bid --too much defence |pg||
nt|ady: spades 2-2   so 4@S on for n/s|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|mamos:  hello|pg||
nt|haans: not that clear what to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: A slightly heavy 4@S does the trick here of keeping @H's out of the picture.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: And 100 is cheap against 620|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 150 sorry|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Roland.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning|pg||
nt|josj: good morning Rolanbd :)|pg||
nt|josj: Roland|pg||
nt|josj: sry|pg||
nt|ady: best lead is a club   but defence then will get 2 clubs and a diamond    heart loser goiing on the diamonds    if a heart is led  then 11 tricks   both clubs go away on the ...|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Difficult to find the @C-lead against 3 NT, if East is declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I think that Gordon will settle for the game .. yes|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  unlikely to make  even guessing well in clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult to bid imo.|pg||
nt|don_kapu: dont know their system, precision or standard|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  - and against 1 NT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: Hard cards it seems.|pg||
nt|rodal f: As to play?|pg||
nt|haans: 2 aces?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: hi Mike|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mamos:  certainly to play  expect itt  to be bid|pg||

nt|rodal f: Seems as that moysany ain't gona work. Next.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|mamos:  seems unlikely that declarer can scramble 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: I suppose from where we sit  could pick up 3 club tricks  by playing low to the queen and king  and later laying down the ace  dropping west's J(  and later finessing against the ...|pg||
nt|ady: 8X in east hand   so could make 3 club tricks 1 spad   1 heart and 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: wests J9|pg||
nt|mcarroll: E will be disappointed to find all finesses working|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rnmalik: Requires some play to make 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|jcwla: I don't think N/S will usu be left to play quietly in 4@H; the comparison may be between 150 and 500.|pg||
nt|haans: we all have missed better games|pg||
nt|ady: kib suggested 3NT  n/s   an unlikely contract  though would make|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jones Karwur according to the profile|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@D probably the Muiderberg style, 5Major and 4 + minor|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mamos:  we'll see : )|pg||
nt|ady: needs to play club now|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|mamos:  I think club players would bid 3NT  not sure that would work either|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|lml: so everybody has had time to wake up|pg||

pc|h7|nt|ady: needs to utilize dummys diamonds for 2 entries  1 to play the 3rd round of clubs and 1 to play a heart|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S made the trial bid of 2@S looking for a check and N took it natural.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rodal f: Did S have max for his NT bid? (12-14)?|pg||

nt|mamos:  wow |pg||
nt|mamos:  ten solid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 7@D only works if S was prepared to underruff from the table.|pg||
nt|mamos:  @s7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Ruff by J and K@S and hand makes.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now an easy grand slam to *play*, but to bid .....|pg||
nt|jcwla: Time to think really big thoughts.  |pg||
nt|ady: if this is bif in OR   will lose imps  that was likely gained on first board|pg||
nt|hawe45:  More fun here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: east playing hearts sort of helped declarer   but understandably did not get the club position right|pg||
nt|mamos:  lol  ol|pg||
nt|ady: e/w likely to play 4@H   by west through a transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  opposite a weak Diamond opener?|pg||
nt|mamos:  6@S opening?|pg||
nt|josj: the EW hands fit the EW team's name very well: May Good Things Happen|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hawe45:  I hate to write it, but 4 @S was could in board 16, suppose South had played the @D 7...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lml: so east west would like to be in five of a minor.  It may be hard now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: especially if Ross takes a bid here|pg||
nt|mamos:  lol  hoping to get doubled later|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They were 25th before the last qualifying round and still got through!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.inabridge.com/|pg||
nt|josj: that's 1 good thing already, then :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: As Martha Stewart says, it's a good thing!|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: played by east 4@H goes down on a club lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A "grown uo"- 4 @H|pg||
mb|5H|nt|buffytvs: presumably that's a txfr|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|lml: I am sure it is|pg||
nt|guppy: well - 3N is even better than than 5m and Piotr found the winning initial action (1N vs. X) to steer them there|pg||
nt|lml: 5@H is a decent save or 5@C|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive at a partscore. Hard for EW to see there nice fit at @C|pg||
nt|rodal f: No @C play. Ruff a @S and a @D.|pg||
nt|ady: north decided on a quiet opening of 1 spade|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not even for money, I would bid 1 @S with such a suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D must be the lightest overcall this century|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and West passed??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't understand this auction, back to bed|pg||
nt|josj: if 2@C is Precision, that pass is a real surprise|pg||
nt|josj: East will certainly bid on...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  up|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 5@D|pg||
nt|lml: either|pg||
nt|buffytvs: tough call for East now|pg||
nt|lml: With those trump I bet he bids on|pg||
nt|lml: if partner has diamonds it looks like he only has 2.5 losers|pg||
nt|buffytvs: a full 18 with a diamond fit, but does he want to commit to 11 tricks?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Cold up here two Hans:(  +5C by the morning.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I agree with you, AQ8@S in E  and he he could be endplayed but we have seen the cards.:)|pg||
mb|5S|nt|lml: well that will be a steal then|pg||
nt|buffytvs: thgouht he might dbl|pg||
mb|d|nt|mamos:  i not sure what North is going to achieve|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What is going on?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: opening with a flat 11 count becoming more prevalent|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I think he should bid|pg||
nt|josj: 3NT was a little joke|pg||
nt|garnetts: it is and they still get to non making games--combined 23 counts--which even the world's best card players cannot make |pg||
nt|don_kapu: depend how to manage not loose 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT also makes |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: if partner has nothing else he has good diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have a save  even vul against not at the 7 level  down 3|pg||
nt|mamos:  are EW getting punished|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But it could NEVER be better to play a @S, sorry|pg||
nt|rodal f: Have S told his story 3 times now?|pg||
nt|jcwla: When you think of the hands that a precision 2@C could be bid on, W cannot possibly think has described this one.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: But might S will be in after a @H lead. Then 10|pg||
nt|rnmalik: unlucky contract.|pg||
nt|josj: but EW in trouble now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The auction is a joke|pg||
nt|jcwla: How do you really feel, Roland? :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A brave man - but he is right|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|buffytvs: avoiding the Elvis Coup in diamonds, which as it happens, doesn't cost|pg||
nt|lml: maybe he didnt think clubs was a transfer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he had even better clubs|pg||
nt|lml: otherwise that is sort of a strange lead|pg||
nt|buffytvs: what would you have led from his hand?|pg||
nt|lml: the elvis coup|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: keith is looking for some high cards|pg||
nt|buffytvs: me too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't know what 2@C is but if Precision the hand is way too good for it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Indeed|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: this is the cheapet for e/w   480 on the club lead|pg||
nt|ady: cheapest|pg||
nt|mamos:  East believes his partner's bidding|pg||
nt|rodal f: So a bit fun by the bidding.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Clear 1@C|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mamos:  ::)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|buffytvs: there's a 10 :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  out of frying pan|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would 3NT been better NS? Only -1|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This seems to end up with 7 NT RD|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  3@H|pg||
nt|mamos:  :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  bets on 3@H?|pg||
nt|josj: I bet it was Precision (but not quite...)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't like playing grand slams in game|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow, this does not bode well for MGTH -- a little bit of almost humorous interference and they've stopped a level short of what we could have expected and two levels short of what ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: we might have hoped.|pg||
nt|josj: 13 tricks and next board|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mamos:  no   oooh ugly|pg||

nt|don_kapu: hi|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|lml: 2@H over 1NT doesnt have to show much but Taylor's hand was less than not much|pg||
pc|sA|nt|garnetts: The K@C will provide a clue as to the position of the ace --but East did not show a two suiter which might work in his favour|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Maybe an early @C from dummy means the singleton K wins so no @C loser, just a @H and 2@Ds let it make?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|rodal f: John gave me some mouth and is right. 3@H the best for NS by there poss.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now I understand the rule: "The 5-level belongs to the opponents". When East bids 5 @H, North is opponent, so...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mcarroll: Hi Geoffrey|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lml: now Piotrk nows the diamond position|pg||
nt|lml: and the club position and the heart position....|pg||

nt|roswolf: n/s may pick the wrong suit as trumps|pg||
nt|ady: north has an awkward decision    1NT overcall could be expensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: if e/w compete  they can make 8 tricks in hearts  and go down1 in 3 hearts likely undoubled to lose 100|pg||
nt|rodal f: We all do. Specs as commentators. Not the best we have seen.|pg||
nt|josj: about previous board, that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: OK; so 2@C was Precision but it was also poor judgement|pg||
nt|jcwla: Such a distortion, that 2@C.  That hand needs so little in the way of a mesh with pd to become, as Edna Ferber would say, so big.|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: I guess 2NT shows a heart raise of some sort|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a partial available and lower the contract the better it is, |pg||
nt|haans: yep better played by S|pg||
nt|ady: sspade lead should certainly out paid to this|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: think e/w will play 3@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s are in kami-kaze mood|pg||
nt|haans: @H lead not good either|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  NS may go to 4@D|pg||
nt|josj: it certainly was an unhappy choice|pg||
nt|ady: if declarer ducks twice  east can then swith to a heart|pg||
nt|ady: switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: thanks !|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rnmalik: all hands played so far have been misfits including the one which is being played.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Double - without even one trick in your hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I was going to say that 5@D was too expensive a save, but this will be even more expensive|pg||
pc|d2|nt|buffytvs: the C!A is a disappointment to declarer -- it's a trick, but he'd far rather have the @DK for example|pg||
nt|buffytvs: @CA|pg||
nt|lml: true but there is enough to work with in dummy|pg||
nt|buffytvs: oh yes|pg||
nt|lml: this may take a while though|pg||
nt|mamos:  : )|pg||
nt|ady: may make 3@H  if defence slips up and does not cash 3 spade tricks|pg||
nt|ady: oh   5@D    well over the top|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D got what it asked for|pg||
nt|ady: up with ace    can now make|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jcwla: 2@S went down only 1 in the CR so the first blood is 2 IMPs to MGTH.|pg||
nt|josj: this time, the proper contract was reached easily enough|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@S is an amazing bid|pg||
nt|don_kapu: is kamikaze same with harakiri ?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|buffytvs: he could play this as a dummy reversal|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mamos:  not a gimme|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A very sporty 2 @C-bid by south, needs one Ace more|pg||
nt|ady: guess the club and home|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - 5 @D X is OK for + 3 IMPÂ´s|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: I think he will just set up diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: probably about now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: seems simplest|pg||
pc|hT|nt|don_kapu: 5@S = kamikaze bidding and Dbl = harakiri bidding|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mamos:  yes  major suit holdings were never going to be good enough|pg||
nt|roswolf: no - hari kiri you kill yourself - kami-kaze involves killing other people  namely partner!!:)|pg||
nt|don_kapu: :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lml: definitely about now!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he might well guess the diamond position seeing the 9 fall|pg||
nt|lml: I am certain he will guess the position but I am usually wrong|pg||
nt|lml: he knows the spade honors are likely split and Piotr has 0-6 so there isnt much room for diamond honors|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|mamos:  oppo havent id Spades so partner is likely to hold 3 |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: was better for west to have overtaken the first spade and played 2nd spade   defence needed to get 2 spades first and have east on lead for the heart switch|pg||
pc|c3|nt|buffytvs: yes -- good point about the spades|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pg||

mb|p|nt|buffytvs: unfortunately they've started us 8 bds apart again, so no comparisons for the next four boards either|pg||

nt|jcwla: Good pass by E.|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|lml: yeah I think they can make 3NT anyway|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but the spades are friendly, as long as you don't play Restricted Choice|pg||
nt|lml: as long as they guess spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the key is to cash the ace first|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if you don[t guess spades, you may be struggling|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT a obv 2/1 bid.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: www.inabridge.com  for standings after round 5|pg||

nt|josj: but not too many overtricks available this time|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: seen it|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: he's oging to get a diamond lead, and will take the inference that North is likely to have longer spades, and play a spade to the king (I think)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: Feeling good enough for a lift by ure @SXX? Nope|pg||
nt|mamos:  I like 4@D opposite 1NT to show 55 no slam interest|pg||
nt|ady: big swings on hands 2 & 3       n/s made 3NT on hand 2   and played 6@SX on 3  making 13 tricks   |pg||
nt|roswolf: well they might|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - 1 @D!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: then he may well go wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@H for EW has play |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I do not like 2@H--better to pass and then bid to show a real opner |pg||
nt|ady: likely J@H lead|pg||
nt|ady: defence will need to switch to a spade when in with a diamond|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lml: guess you cant|pg||
nt|buffytvs: neitehr deterred by the 4333 shape|pg||
nt|jcwla: Can't thread the needle with this hand -- "or it makes or it doesn't."|pg||
nt|josj: 3 inescapable losers|pg||
nt|josj: as is so often the case :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: the spade bid and raise show the fitting hands|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 4@S better for n/s|pg||
nt|garnetts: After a redouble it is normal that immediate bids by opener show minimal values |pg||
pc|cA|nt|lml: he is going to need some help from his friends|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but 10 tricks in spades are even more difficult than 9 in NT on this deal|pg||
nt|lml: well the heart lead didnt hurt him|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- Keith avoided the club lead|pg||
nt|lml: if he guesses spades there might be some sort of endplay|pg||
nt|buffytvs: which would blow a trick|pg||
nt|lml: so how can you make it|pg||
nt|buffytvs: strip hearts, draw trumps, and play a diamond, hoping North ducks?|pg||
nt|mamos:  n our earlier stanza we saw examples where overcall not made and suit not lead and imps lost|pg||
nt|josj: yes, E hand is difficult to judge|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|buffytvs: then he has to give a ruff-sluff or play clubs, which would be enough|pg||
nt|josj: even more so as long as you don't know about the 5-5 opposite|pg||
nt|jcwla: As I predicted, the comparison on 2 was between 4@S-3 and 4@S-3 doubled.  So 8 more to MGTH to break on top by double figures.|pg||
nt|ady: might  make unless west rises with ace and switches to a spade|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mamos:  Weak 2@D made life easy for North on 3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: on hand 3  south opened a weak 2@D   so easier for north to bid 6@S|pg||
nt|josj: but a chance for Kepri to pull back on  3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The lead of @S also helps declarer.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mamos:  as it happens if NS play Diamonds West will lead|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mcarroll: yep|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: For NS and @C 2-2? Bookmark this site: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|buffytvs: 10 tricks in spades NS, 11 in diamonds EW|pg||
nt|ady: north will open|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  4@H should make|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have fair values for game   but 4@S looks doomed     3NT has some chance|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lml: I dont think this will be played in 4@S|pg||
nt|buffytvs: not a LAW deal though -- 22 total trumps|pg||
nt|mamos:  4@S not hopeless|pg||
nt|ady: off beat pre-empt ny south may come against him|pg||
nt|ady: poor pre-empt   especially vul|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This hand fitted well into their system|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: but the LAW is often very imprecise when there are two big fits|pg||
nt|ady: any plus for e/w may be a decent result here|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: and double fits|pg||
nt|lml: so how high to go|pg||
nt|buffytvs: usually it predicts too few tricks though, not too many|pg||
nt|lml: that is an awfully good weak 2|pg||
nt|lml: we can see that 5@D makes|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Definitely|pg||
mb|p|nt|don_kapu: will e/w go to 4@S ?|pg||
nt|garnetts: might be forced into bidding 4@S |pg||
nt|roswolf: has west denied 4 spades?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: even 4-11 it is a good weak 2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: aha -- a wide range weak 2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: tactical, 3rd chair|pg||
nt|lml: so Taylor needs to dive|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think Ross isoing to bid again|pg||
nt|buffytvs: going|pg||
nt|lml: I will provide the board for him ... dive dive dive|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S too much|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult decision for N, pass looks appropriate.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|buffytvs: he may be worried about defending 6@D|pg||
nt|lml: you have no defense fellow and lots of offense|pg||
nt|ady: dont thin can make Mike|pg||
pc|d4|nt|buffytvs: remember Keith could have a 4-count|pg||
nt|lml: okay I give you that one... but east only bid 3@D|pg||
nt|lml: and west was a passed hand|pg||
nt|buffytvs: switch the ace and king of clubs between West and North -- same auction, EW cold for a slam|pg||
nt|lml: well the defenders will like the lead momentarily|pg||
nt|rnmalik: As the cards are placed NS can make 6@D but difficult to bid.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|rodal f: A endplay needed EW by no @C lead and @S returne.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mamos:  no   the Heart break  looks too much to cope with|pg||
nt|garnetts: very fortunate lie of the cards |pg||
pc|dT|nt|buffytvs: although maybe Gord would have opened that hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcwla: A couple of early coffee break boards.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ady: had it down on top on a heart lead    but still dont think it will make|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The friendly lie of the @Cs lets the contract make|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: now a 2nd diamond|pg||
nt|don_kapu: amora|pg||
nt|roswolf: but still off |pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: Did we like that 2@C bid?|pg||

nt|jcwla: Liugo and Hidayat have not matched the 6@S bid on 27 - over W's 2@C call (about which the less said the better), Hidayat bid 4@C and so there was not the same inference to Liugo's ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4@S bid as to Manoppo's.  Hidayat tried again with 5@C but the lack of a side card to show meant a 5@S response and a triste pass.|pg||
pc|h2|mc|7|nt|jcwla: So with the 11 on 27 and the 13 here on 22, a new leader.|pg||

nt|rnmalik: trump promotion both hands but W did not capitilise. @H return and @C by E, the contract was -1.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4 was an overtrick IMP to MGTH in 4@S when Hidayat went to bed with @CA.  13-11 thru 4 comparisons.|pg||

nt|rodal f: Hi David - Mike - specs and the nice vug operator.|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|buffytvs: those are the judgment calls that swing a lot of IMPs.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: NS had a cheap save and didn't take it -- plus position EW|pg||
nt|lml: those are the ones that keep me up at night|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Did South DOUBLE 1 @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: this is the 1st quarter of the finals of the Canadian Senior Team Championships|pg||
nt|mamos:  hi Frank|pg||
nt|mamos:  another straightforward game|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s might stymie themselves here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N may be tempted to go overboard after the Double from S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: part score again    10 tricks in clubs for e/w|pg||
mb|d|nt|flash: bear with us, folks - it'll take us a bit to settle in|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: Judy Wolff would call it a 'napkin hand' -- same idea|pg||
nt|ady: hi Frank|pg||
nt|josj: ah, this should help EW to detect the duplication|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: on board 1 Gartaganis won a couple of imps and board 2 was a push|pg||
nt|rodal f: Amazing reverse from S. Why not X? I have also @H and @D.|pg||
nt|josj: 5@S is still OK...|pg||
nt|haans: no good lead anywere|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S makeable but 3NT was a superior contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: i think we missed an initial pass|pg||
nt|flash: i think you'll have to redo the whole auction to get South on lead...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@C a sound contract.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and as the cards are placed EW are making 6@C.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|flash: there are 36 boards shown on the scorecard, so we'll guess that we'll have 18 per quarter|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||

pc|h9|pg||

nt|josj: wd after all|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thought they might get in trouble after 5@D but wd.|pg||
nt|josj: so did I...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N will lose more tricks in Trumps than in any other suit after the threadbare double from S|pg||

pc|s6|nt|hawe45:  But against 620, it is good business|pg||

pc|c9|nt|ady: not fond of the 2@H  bid in that austion|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: auction|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lml: 5@D made ... if you recall that board|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|josj: 4@S would have been much easier to handle, though...|pg||
nt|josj: but this is as good a shot as any|pg||
nt|jcwla: 5 a push at 4@H making.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes, so questionable bidding - to put it politely - is rewarded|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c7|nt|lml: here they defended 4@H doubled|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|lml: this is a hand where you count tricks as you play them ... trick 6|pg||
nt|lml: and I just need 2 more|pg||
nt|buffytvs: playing the last diamond and ruffing with the J will work well now|pg||

nt|rodal f: Feeling for a 1NT here Ralf?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might after 1@D. But I recomend normaly to stay out there.|pg||
nt|roswolf: that would have guaranteed some slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lml: its the not breaks part that is a problem|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same|pg||
nt|jcwla: I wouldn't put any IMPs on Kepri's side of the ledger just yet; as you said, Jos, that bd fraught w/peril.|pg||
nt|josj: but if S ruffs @HK high and plays a trump, he avoids the endplay|pg||
nt|josj: will we see, shortly, Jordan :)|pg||
nt|josj: unlucky to go down in 5 already...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|buffytvs: do you bid 1@S with the East cards?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ralfwil: but 3nt needs a careful play after a @h lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: A nice bid at OR. Playable.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This is a better 11 count than some wew have seen opened |pg||
nt|mcarroll: we|pg||
nt|garnetts: last hand maybe South should bid 6@C and then 6@H over 6@D  |pg||
nt|ady: card fairly friendly for n/s   can make 9 tricks in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: nah|pg||
nt|buffytvs: just asking :)|pg||
nt|guppy: criminal to do so...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or a auto play?|pg||
nt|rodal f: @C NS need so @D u just forget.|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s playing strong club?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mamos:  not an easy hand Frank|pg||
nt|josj: X by N shows four spades...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I was going to say something starting off queens are... but then I thought ...maybe not the best phrase|pg||
nt|mamos:  Id expect to raise with North|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hmm 800 not really the reward I was anticipating|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: confirmed as Edmonton...    West won the Canadian Open Pairs in the '80s and the E-W pair was 2nd in last year's edition of the COPC|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! a direct finess in @c to keep entries on dummy|pg||
nt|rodal f: There best % I forgot to tell, but all see that.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree.|pg||
nt|garnetts: That would have grabbed North's attention |pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: i wonder how forcing this sequence is for them?|pg||

nt|buffytvs: then it will be 4@H I agree|pg||
nt|lml: it would anyway|pg||
nt|flash: my informant has a slight rooting interest in the match - she's married to West...|pg||

nt|mamos:  i think so Frank|pg||
nt|josj: over 4@C, W has an almost automatic cuebid so if he refuses ther mght very well be something rotten. Ask Roland :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would rather chew my own arm off then lead that |pg||
nt|haans: we all did :)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: 2@S again?|pg||
nt|snoraa: dicey little hand..noone wants to play it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Mike Lawrence also waxes lyrical in ranting about Ace leads|pg||
nt|haans: new bid 18-19 balanced|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lml: a couple of imps came back on the hand in 4@S where Taylor went 3 down after he didnt finesse the diamond|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: more and more popular|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mamos:  not many would pass strong Club with North|pg||
nt|garnetts: He doesn't like them much either then lol|pg||
nt|mcarroll: seems we missed 24|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: do you think north south will buy this in spades?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no|pg||
nt|buffytvs: not undoubled anyway|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3rd seat very light opening by S.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lml: in the OR Wolpert the West hand had a chance to raise diamonds|pg||
nt|buffytvs: as did West here|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but declined to|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  can be beatend if defence gets a spade ruff and waits for a club trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: now he will I think|pg||
nt|flash: welcome to Paul Thurston|pg||
nt|thurston:  jc might scramble 7 here|pg||
nt|josj: but still, I sympathise with 5@C|pg||
nt|jcwla: In any case the 10 are in and Kepri more than doubling up MGTH through 8 comparisons.|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  beatenon diamond lead|pg||
mb|4D|nt|lml: I think he has to raise now... dont you?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: although I like dbl better on east's hand|pg||
nt|lml: or do you think ... my partner is playing me for this|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this just sounds like lots of diamonds|pg||
nt|buffytvs: exactly|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I would be thikning, if all partner needs is third jack of diamonds and an ace, he should have done something stronger|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: gords head is in his hands|pg||
nt|thurston:  ugly hand to lead from|pg||
nt|snoraa: good shot on lead|pg||
nt|thurston:  most effective start a low heart and that was probably Maurice's last choice|pg||
nt|flash: red suit best for the defense - @D8 would have been reasonable?   (but anything might've worked)|pg||
nt|flash: i love the Ten from that holding (if one is going to lead the suit)|pg||
nt|haans: but do they not have a stop @H bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: on the other hand, playing in 4 of a minor is like kissing your sister|pg||
nt|flash: starts to unblock and should preserve any honor(s) in partner's hand|pg||
mb|4N|nt|josj: I wonder what 3@C and 3@D are|pg||
nt|josj: and I hope we are getting an undo|pg||
nt|roswolf: some 2@D INTERVENTION!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: what was 2@D?   |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Grand slam on ruffing @D finesse. 7@S but as the @S are 3/3 6@S a good contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: as we expected - 3nt went down in OR|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3@S must be forcing|pg||
mb|5D|nt|buffytvs: wd Gord|pg||
nt|lml: I thought that was a tie|pg||
nt|flash: sorry - CSTCs - honour(s)|pg||
nt|roswolf: obviously a transfer:)!?|pg||
nt|haans: yes kick as they fall|pg||
nt|ady: east might lead a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|thurston:  always nive when part has the 9 so deceptive potential|pg||
nt|josj: I guess it confirmed the five-card @H|pg||
nt|josj: over the 3@C relay|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 7@S or NT |pg||
mb|5H!|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: one @C loser can be pitched on @D ace.|pg||
mb|7D|nt|alchilds: close|pg||
nt|lml: well norths spades arent so hot so he can definitely have the @HK now|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S can be made     there is an option of plays|pg||
nt|ady: thats torn it    this should make now|pg||
nt|ady: that was about the only lead to give it|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: weak distributional hand with support for all four suits?  |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Interesting illustration of Burn's Law|pg||
nt|roswolf: another 3-3 fit which contravenes burn's law|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: 7@D sorry|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mamos:  a Heart overcall would have made South's lead easier|pg||
nt|rodal f: A push or do E find the @D hook?|pg||
nt|mamos:  now Diamond finesse is  free|pg||
nt|mamos:  as Heart loser certain to go away|pg||
nt|ady: yes agree|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: leading a heart there forced him to take the finesse|pg||
nt|ady: if that fails fall back on club finesse|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might the @D was needed anyway, by a @H lead.|pg||

nt|flash: so, unless E-W use Polish-style leads, perhaps West could have worked out not to cash the @SA|pg||
nt|mamos:  yes sorry Frank think you are wrong this time|pg||
nt|rodal f: But wich one?|pg||
nt|mamos:  a few imps back|pg||
nt|rodal f: But still 2 segments more so...|pg||
nt|jcwla: On 9, where S failed by one in 2@C here, W in the CR made 2@H -- so 2 more to Kepri.|pg||
nt|jcwla: S's opening in there was not 1@C or 3@C but an esoteric 1NT.|pg||
nt|josj: remarkable as it should have been the other way round|pg||
nt|ady: back to down 1    understandly got the spade wrong    was easy from here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: can take both   |pg||
nt|mcarroll: WEhe playing in a trump contract, it is preferable that the declaring side has the majority of trumps - as I understand it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: When|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|lml: 5@S|pg||
nt|lml: sorry|pg||

mb|1S|nt|flash: folks, we're a VERY small group this segment, so please move down toward the front of the auditorium and feel free to ask questions   :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems a swingy hand |pg||
nt|haans: board 6 slam -1 at both rooms|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|josj: maybe, a fully passive defence beats 2@H in CR|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Any for a X from S? If...|pg||

pc|c6|nt|thurston:  9 tricks for Joey, NEXT!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: @D first I agree.|pg||

nt|thurston:  hi steve|pg||
nt|flash: a @C??|pg||
nt|flash: @S2???|pg||
nt|flash: passive or attack??|pg||
nt|thurston:  i like a club - maybe part's length and strength where nothing else rates to be|pg||
nt|snoraa: attack, but with what?  c best, but very hard|pg||
nt|thurston:  and that's without peeking!|pg||
nt|mamos:  3NT looks good result for EW here|pg||
nt|jcwla: That would have been 5 instead of 2.  4@H a reasonable shot here but...|pg||
nt|garnetts: I must admit to being cautious enough to pass 1@S as South |pg||
nt|haans: yes should but will not|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|flash: i must admit, i've played opposite Michael, so i had a bit of an edge here   :)|pg||

nt|mamos:  lots of 10s, 9s, 8s|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is not an easy hand to play|pg||
nt|roswolf: i dont understand the bidding - not for the first time - 3nt was out of left field|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|rodal f: Any reason not leading a @C?|pg||
nt|josj: yep but not if 2@H goes down and 2@C makes...|pg||
nt|haans: 2nt lavinthal|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C forced|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|buffytvs: nine tricks looks like a good result in the other room|pg||

nt|mcarroll: This is probably -2 for 3 imps away|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: would have preferred a neg double by South|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Too many falt boards at the ending|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes - which is marked on the bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|lml: I think they are headed to the same contract as the OR|pg||
nt|buffytvs: the earlier Board where Gord went down in a tricky 2@S, Darren Wolpert took a very different line and ended up with 9 tricks --so now the lead is down to 6|pg||

nt|ady: over the top in OR   another chance to get some imps back for Telkom|pg||
nt|rodal f: Strange when the sellular need to be at the hotelroom|pg||
nt|mamos:  NS bid game in Or without quite the values|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D high in OR   high  3 major suit losers of the top  unless a mis defence|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The 2@C opening makes life difficult for NS|pg||
mb|5C!|mb|p|nt|lml: works on this hand|pg||
nt|ady: not sure why down 2|pg||
nt|haans: North started with a pass and then jumped to 5@D|pg||

mb|5S|nt|lml: fascinating|pg||
nt|haans: in OR|pg||
