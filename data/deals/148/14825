nt|Vugraphzfd: west was a bit slow with the @D back|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I did that without using my feet|pg||
nt|ritong: lol  but it does not matter at all:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  sure it does|pg||
nt|ritong: okay|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You mean my feet don't matter??|pg||
mb|2C|nt|andyv:  tempo on this is very vital... does anyone hesitate when they have the A@d to underlead it?|pg||
nt|ritong: i m sure they are extremely cute, R|pg||
nt|reisig: A reminder ..the team names are reversed|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|andyv:  your feet do matter, Roland;)|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, andy|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  but very hard to prove if any coffee housing done, as you well know, Henri|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is nothing wrong with 6NT, @DJ is woth a fortune|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *worth|pg||
nt|andyv:  i like woth|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT may also be a slam killer here. I suggest Kokish|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|andyv:  3N should get them to slam, however|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's awkward to show your hand over 3NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  over 4@s, 5N (pick a slam)|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, but you have an 8 count|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So much easier over 2NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  and I agree Kokish is better but this will work on simply brute force|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5N|nt|andyv:  of course, if they say they haven't discussed this auction.....|pg||
nt|reisig: I hope they know what they doing here|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|mildredb: so does east|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, W could play it as GSF but I doubt it.|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||
nt|mildredb: not in this auction, I don't think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: west actually laughed out loud, seems to not know...|pg||
nt|andyv:  are we sure these two have played together before?|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, I don't want to hear about the 40 year rule|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kokish is a convention where the strong hand can show if he has 22-24 or 25+ balanced without bypassing 2NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|nt|reisig: whew|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: west now says 5N was 'pick a slam'|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  a tough match|pg||
