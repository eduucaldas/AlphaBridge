mb|p|nt|casenjo:  East has a great source of tricks and should drive this to slam|pg||

nt|casenjo:  Good  bridge players are good planners.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  North knows that there will be a long suit in dummy and has a lot to think about|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Heart lead gives West 13 tricks, any other lead gets to 12, unless North is squeezed|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|casenjo:  So the question is: Down 1 or 2?|pg||
nt|xenya: or 3?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: @D lead|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Yes, perfect defense and clubs are played out of hand|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Best lead!!!|pg||
nt|phil: but they can only take two clubs|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h3|pc|dA|pg||
nt|casenjo:  ruff this, spade back, ruff again and declarer plays from hand|pg||
nt|xenya: exactly|pg||
nt|phil: the lead should be suit preference if the partnership is in tune, although the double need not be Lightner-ish|pg||
nt|casenjo:  At the other table, Brogeland led the 10 of diamonds, but Erik now cashed the ace of clubs, letting declarer out for down 1|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|phil: only because they didnt get their club trick, North continued a spade after the 2nd diamond ruff|pg||
nt|casenjo:  allowing declarer to get to dummy|pg||
nt|phil: rt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: if kyle ruffs this and returns a low club (not unreasonable if rose doesn't ask for a spade back) then they can get it 4 on a misguess|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|hT|pc|d3|pg||

mc|8|nt|casenjo:  agreed|pg||
