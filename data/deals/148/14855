nt|sybarra: oh they changed names,  skip previous comment |pg||
nt|casenjo:  transfer to clubs|pg||
mb|4S|nt|brolucius: 2@S is a transfer to clubs and South will have two possible responses: 2NT and 3@C. 2NT would indicate a good fit for clubs.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|casenjo:  Yes, 'in between pre accepts'|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|casenjo:  NS comes out shooting, bidding a game on a finesse, but alas the king is offside|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ritong: duboin should make this, he does not need to guess @ds when @cs split that way|pg||
nt|sybarra: the club players I was talking about are in the other room  but we have a great room!|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|ritong: but he has a trump control problem|pg||
nt|sybarra: low @H from Jeff or a spade? |pg||
nt|ritong: so, if aker plays a @h back, south might consider pitching a @c|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
pc|d8|nt|brolucius: East's @S3 was a discouraging signal, warning West not to continue spades (into the lion's jaw - South's A-J).|pg||

mb|2S|nt|Vugraphzfc: The 7-triple-two is certainly a turn-off|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Not sure how that would help him though|pg||
nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  If you hover your mouse over the other room score, a pop-up shows what the bidding was there.|pg||

nt|ritong: well giorgio recovered|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, a gentle start to the session.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  A friendly start for the Strul team|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Norwegian pair is incredibly aggressive when looking for slams. Most people would regard them as over-aggressive in that area.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Welcome to our Canadien expert!|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|frankaus: fasinating collection here|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmm  indeed |pg||

nt|fabsayc: Canadian, I am not french :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|casenjo:  oops! So Sorry|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brolucius: North has passed. If he were to bid, he would have used transfers over a take-out double.|pg||
nt|dima:  Hi all|pg||
nt|henryb:  A possible game for E-W, and no safe harbor for N-S|pg||
mb|3H|nt|casenjo:  I was originally from Detroit, so close to Windsor that I was semi-Canadian, and do understand the difference|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Bjorn has something to think about here. It sounds to him like a pinocle deck|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|brolucius: 5@C is a lucky make, needing two good things to happen.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ugh |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: or should I say "yuck" |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: vuls wrong to act|pg||
nt|casenjo:  and the expert is correct, Bjorn new the vulnerability was wrong here|pg||
nt|casenjo:  knew, not new|pg||
nt|fabsayc: besides raising would have just helped opponents who actually have missed an excellent slam|pg||
nt|casenjo:  sorry, folks, had a couple drinks at dinner, please excuse my typing|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|ritong: the good old reversed two suiters|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No-one can double 3NT but it sure is a terrible contract|pg||
nt|frankaus: play missfits in 3NT is a common view|pg||
nt|brolucius: North may be considering 3NT. No, he has bid just 3@D.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Indeed; but passing 3@d by E is not appreciating how good her hand is|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was an unsuccessful bidding board for East-West. They can make 10 or 11 tricks in their best fit but have sold out to 3@D. |pg||
nt|henryb:  She was close (imo) between 2@c and 3@c on the first round|pg||
nt|dima:  Would X over 3@d be to compete some place or penalty? |pg||
nt|po-s: About an ace more than she might have had|pg||
nt|brolucius: East had two great cards for partner and had made only a forced 2@C bid.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: each player would rather have another pard,  if they could see all cards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: With clubs 3-2 it has *some* play, but this is awful|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to duck the @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that is easy |pg||
nt|frankaus: duboin did well to stay out of the action|pg||
nt|sybarra: your rightie opens you best suit,  easy to stay out |pg||
nt|frankaus: red light helped|pg||
nt|ritong: so this is a matter of number of undertricks|pg||
nt|frankaus: 50's :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: as pointed out to me,  then your lefty bids you next best suit,  |pg||
nt|sybarra: how does it feel now?|pg||
nt|ritong: going down less than your counterpart is also a way to win imps ( homer nods)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Neither North nor South liked their spade holdings and took the conservative road|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|sybarra: here comes a @D most likely |pg||
nt|sybarra: just make the communication a mess |pg||
nt|frankaus: u look at dummy u look at ur hand and still cant find even 6 tricks :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: 8 of @D or club?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you might hope for the clubs to break - I am not sure that Aker is contemplating suicide at this point|pg||

pc|c3|nt|Walddk4: The good news for Aker is that he won't go 4 down|pg||

nt|fabsayc: not sure why he did not play for seven, is doubtful he will get any useful info by playing the spades about whether to finesse in diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: has nothing to do with it|pg||
nt|casenjo:  The opening lead places those high cards with south, and north bid vulnerable. Kamil's problem is: did North bid on strength or length?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|frankaus: brb|pg||
nt|brolucius: East might have given a suit-preference signal on the first round of hearts, attempting to show the @SK to her partner.|pg||

nt|po-s: This is a European fight in a way; Norway against Poland/Russia|pg||

pc|hA|nt|sybarra: and indeed we have beaten this to death,   |pg||
nt|Walddk4: It would also be unwise as the defence can't come to more than 1 heart, 2 diamonds and 1 club|pg||

nt|fabsayc: i shift to spade 9|pg||
pc|s5|nt|warrens:  best line looks to be to ruff a diamond and lead a small club to the 10|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Dima - when did they stop flip-flopping between Precision and Polish?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Dont know exactly but they do switch a lot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D probably a random game try with @D length just a coincidence|pg||

nt|fabsayc: good duck by kamil also|pg||

nt|casenjo:  Levin-Weinstein only beat 2 clubs by ONE trick, so a pickup by DeKnijff|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: since Dubinin DBLs it doesn't apply, but good point for partnerships to discuss if PASS would be forcing|pg||

nt|casenjo:  Rip Van Winkle Coup|pg||
nt|casenjo:  sit there long enuf that the opponents go to sleep|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: many play that forcing PASS applies only if he'd bid something stronger than 4@S on last round|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|sybarra: and S has no @S.....I am sure Aker is pondering entire hand now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He must keep @SQ in dummy, then he should be OK|pg||

nt|ritong: i m not sure what his worries are|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|henryb:  good contract, although unsuccessful|pg||

nt|ahollan1: too right - i was just trying to come up with any rationale for Strul making a choice|pg||
nt|dima:  And Alexander Dubinin comes to help with @d - lovely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would North bid the same way with 4@H 5@D?|pg||
nt|dima:  Strul is going to have some more grey hair till this board is over|pg||
nt|dima:  I think one MIGHT bid 4@d with 5@d and 4@h as some kibs point out|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: I think it is unclear since there is always a [slim] chance that partner won't be able to bid EITHER red suit|pg||
nt|dima:  Oh well now one still has to play the hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: South could easily be  3226|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dima:  With that it might be more prudent to run from 4@c XX to 5@c :)|pg||
nt|dima:  And they will get a @h ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with natural trump trick isn't it?|pg||
nt|dima:  So let's see - 2@s + 1@c + 2@h + 1@d that is 800 to begin with|pg||
nt|dburn: that may be all - not so bad|pg||
nt|dima:  could be worse from Strul's perspective :)|pg||
nt|dburn: but hearts would have been better - perhaps not really possible to get to those, since Strul wasn't allowed to reredouble 4@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: while we ponder I'd like to retract an earlier statement of mine   Gromov-Dubinin have always played Precision throughout   i was thinking of a different pair [martens-jassem] who ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: play Precision or Polish depending upon vul|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: NS play udca so in principle fallenius diamond was encouraging|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|dburn: and South drove to game with a nondescript seven count? boy, these guys are tough|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however fredin knows any diamond tricks are not disappearing so he goes passive|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|dima:  Gromov-Dubinin play variable NT - 12+-15 in 1/2 and 15-17 in 3/4th|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They play the cards well; they don't need so many points|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk4: team rosters: http://www.acbl.org/nabc/rosters/2010/02/SPINGOLD/  for all of them, also the ones that are knocked out|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|dima:  Now Gromov surely has a complete count since Strul would bid 4@h with 4 of those|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|c8|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Things are not boding well for Fleisher. He does not rate to make this hand, while his teammates are about to go down in 3 hearts|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d9|nt|dburn: maybe he does, unless of course that @c4 could be low from two|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|warrens:  hmm, what now?|pg||
nt|dima:  this is probably misclick|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: declarer actually had a chance -- on this defense, after @CAce   @DQ !!|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: [thanks Gene]|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn: I am not sure it matters much - or at least, it matters to the extent that he ought not to duck a heart|pg||
nt|dburn: but of course he didn't do that|pg||
nt|warrens:  needs to play a trump now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that might be a bit double-dummy  but would have made for a good article|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - he was down threee more or less whatever he did|pg||
nt|dima:  I think always 800|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dburn: although as Warren remarks, West had better play his diamond or Strul can get out for down two|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe that's right --  @DQ  @CK pitching @H  @H ruff|pg||

nt|casenjo:  so, this is 5 more for DeKnijff|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|sybarra: Dorothy Truscott |pg||
nt|dburn: but that was a good effort all round - declarer kept his head, and the defenders needed to be and were accurate at the finish|pg||
mb|1S|nt|casenjo:  They have gained 33 imps in 7 hands..that is a LOT|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: mannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny years ago |pg||
nt|casenjo:  When things like this happen to me, I find it is a good idea to get upn and get a glass of water|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S interesting bid, it would be a splinter or stopper ask for most partnerships|pg||
mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: apparently fallenius plays it as stopper showing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H implies spade fit, and lead directing by a passed hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is a two edged sword though, as might help defense if you end in spade contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: spades? anyone got any spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgeguys.com/pdf/GazzilliND.pdf  for a longer version of Gazzilli, 18 pages. Worth reading if you have nothing better to do|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not a very productive 24-count, partly because both hands are 4-3-3-3.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And the way the broadcast is set up, Asya can't enter results from the other room|pg||
nt|henryb:  and no suits break|pg||

nt|dima:  Who needs spades :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oops|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: well, if you want to score plus 420 instead of plus 110, you need spades - and you need to bid them|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kamil is either also bidding tactically or not on same wavelength|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 4+@D, unbal    they open weak NT with 44441@D|pg||

nt|ritong: a friendly dummy to come|pg||
nt|brolucius: Is it possible for Brogeland to show restraint ever? No!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I will get results from someone sooner or later|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk4: This is a contract even I can make, also at 4:55 am. 6 hearts and 2 spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: I said joost,  meant Jack Oest    |pg||
nt|casenjo:  I'm surprised at Kamil, it is pretty normal to have support for spades on this auction, since west is  a passed hand, he didn;t open 2 hearts....|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: maybe he figured anything undoubled was ok|pg||
mb|p!|mb|p|nt|brolucius: We will see if Erik can make bricks out of straw.|pg||
nt|dima:  Probably did not like the idea of having to find a bid after 1@d - 1@s - 2@d - ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C was 6+@C, 9-11 HCP|pg||
pc|sA|nt|casenjo:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: didnt mean to click alreat|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||
nt|brolucius: No hurry to test the hearts, clearly. Instead declarer tries to make something of the diamonds.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It will take a while|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn: oh, indeed he didn't, and I have a lot of sympathy with the choice of 3@c|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: interesting that neither pair could find the @S fit|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|brolucius: I remember how annoyed I used to get, every time a team-mate said 'Going to 3NT didn't matter. We couldn't make 2NT.'  Ah, yes, very wise. For most people that would be an ...|pg||

nt|sybarra: some day in the future, the USA will adopt running scores..............|pg||
nt|ritong: the top spot is 6NT by north|pg||

nt|ritong: because of his stranded @hK|pg||
nt|sybarra: so where do you start the bidding with N?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C I presume|pg||

nt|sybarra: I would start with 2 @C |pg||

nt|casenjo:  Eric made his bricks out of straw|pg||

nt|jtr: @h|pg||
nt|brolucius: Sally Brock wrote a book that included several deals that had not gone well. She had my admiration for it. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: okay i have some results from the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: board 3 4 spades by south making 5|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: board 5- 5hearts doubled by west down 2|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 6-7 IMPs to be added|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told: Good players should be able to do that. in "My 60 memorable games" chess champion Bobby Fisher included several of his own defeats too.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The open room is back now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: However, the tables are not linked so that won't help a lot as far as comparisons are concerned|pg||
nt|jtr: He seems lovely|pg||
nt|casenjo:  it appears to be 17-6 Strul after the first 5 boards|pg||
nt|jtr: Sry |pg||
nt|brolucius: I am tempted to predict that this will be the world's flattest 3NT. We will see.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  You are bold, I'm rarely tempted to predict|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even Reese was self-deprecating at times. 'I am about to play a diamond when, at the last minute, I realise that...'|pg||
nt|dima:  The bidding was the same|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, 4@s wasn;'t cold, but it would have been more interesting to watch than 3@c|pg||
nt|dburn: still, at least Gromov played it quickly|pg||
nt|dima:  THAT is true :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the only difference is that Helgemo's 1@D was 4+ but could have been balanced|pg||
nt|dima:  And playing Precision you dont have a lot of power to make 4@s after opening at most 24 points so go with 7-card suit|pg||
nt|dima:  I think Reese called those 7411 girafe hands or so|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: quick break|pg||
nt|dima:  Kibs suggest swans and cologne :)|pg||
nt|dburn: both correct|pg||
nt|dima:  In any case Reese claimed that those hands should be played in 7-card suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the range for NS weak 2s is 6-12   it's been a long long time since i've seen that range|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: may depend on vulnerability to an extent|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, if North can have 12 then South should bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the only qualifier on their CC is  "may be light 3rd favorable vul"|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brolucius: When you have put your foot into it 50 times, you cease worrying about the 51st time.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Tables are linked now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Open room operator catching up|pg||
nt|dima:  Try :)|pg||
nt|dburn: and if South bids, North may take the view that his 6-4 shape entitles him to show a maximum|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|dima:  Would not MANY of us think it is maximum even within 6-12 range|pg||
nt|dburn: and if all of that comes to pass, North-South will reach a pushy game that they will not make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: CC doesn't describe replies to 2N :(|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Common to play transfer responses opposite 1@C nowadays|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: first step OK right sided NTs|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: artificiality follows, as they say|pg||
pc|dT|nt|dburn: hang on a minute - I hadn't thought of that game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: best line now looks to be win diamond,draw two trumps then play diamonds|pg||
nt|casenjo:  South shouldl not anticipate anything strange|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brolucius: 2@C is check-back, looking for a spade or heart fit.|pg||
nt|dima:  Apparently neither did Becker :)|pg||
nt|dburn: neither had Becker, though I am not sure he was allowed to overrule his partner - depends on the details of their agreements|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: now aren't you glad you're wearing your seat belts?|pg||
nt|dima:  Maybe the rules are: direct 3NT = shut up, 2NT+3NT = allowed to think?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|casenjo:  The opponents hold 18 HCP and 10 hearts and never entered the bidding|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|nt|dburn: I guess West would lead a club against 3NT, and in practice it would not make either|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ritong: @h lead to save an imp|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 2NT=asking, usually balanced|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 3@D=1 suiter in spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 3@H=At least 1 top honour in spades, 3@S=6+@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see I have made one of my famous incorrect comments. 1@C was not natural and 1@H is part of their system responses.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I think 3 hearts is Smolen, 4 hearts, 5 spades|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told they are playing 'a sort of Blue Club'.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: I am glad they wrote this out for you Andy,  we were slightly lost |pg||
nt|dburn: not actually clear that 6NT by North is best - maybe 6@s by North is better|pg||
nt|dima:  Hmmm can declarer drop @h King now?|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess at double dummy this may have a chance also, but in practice I doubt very much that Becker will make it|pg||
pc|s8|nt|brolucius: Well, at least my prediction of 'world's most obvious 3NT' did not go down the chute. Not that I was sticking my neck out very far with that. |pg||
nt|casenjo:  So,it would appear things are splitting|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes suggests even breaks|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|ritong: mm|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ritong: going down in 6NT means @ss5/0 offfside|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dburn: that's his normal play for sure|pg||
nt|dima:  low @h now?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: dropping the singleton K wouldn't have worked anyway|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|sybarra: are e/w even going to get ace of @H?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: plus bad luck in @ds|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dima:  Getting maximum out of it|pg||
pc|d8|nt|dburn: sure it would - two top spades, three more rounds of hearts and West is down to all clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still loses one trump|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|casenjo:  he has now forced them to break clubs for him,,guaranteeing his contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this costs a dummy entry and gives up on establishing diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but it does force them in some layouts to break clubs|pg||
nt|casenjo:  but he cannot go down now, on any lie of the cards|pg||

mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: and forgot pulled 3N to 4@H  --  i'll go back to sleep now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+@D, unbal, 11-15|pg||
nt|dima:  Nicely defended - @d lead does not look automatic on the bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|brolucius: West might have employed Michaels (2@H to show spades and a minor). That is not good when you have six spades and five in the minor, but OK when the suits are this way round.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Passell may wind up going for a large number|pg||
nt|dima:  NS may find a way to 4@h now|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he could have led an old sock and declarer wouldn't have got close to making|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|sybarra: floppying to 3 nt again |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Everything's well now. Scoreline correct|pg||
nt|casenjo:  3NT is a much easier contract than 4Hearts|pg||
nt|brolucius: On hand 8, where North made 400 here. They went one down in 2NT (as you would expect) at the other table, for a 10 IMP swing.|pg||
nt|henryb:  but 4@sX might be even better|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|casenjo:  looking for action?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C agrees hearts and 3@S shows a shortage.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I thought that if South bid a simple 4@h Passell might bid 4@s|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Grant Baze: "6-5 come alive"|pg||
nt|dima:  True|pg||
nt|dburn: may or may not be a good time for the dread four-card-suit overcall|pg||
nt|dima:  This will take some handling|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the fact that 1@D is always unbal will help Strul with @C|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@h isn't at all a bad contract, but the breaks aren't great|pg||
mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: transfer response to 1@C, and 2@D artificial game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South's hand was too slam-worthy for Brogeland to bid 4@H, probably. 3NT will show no shortage.|pg||
nt|dima:  I think Strul will have a good picture after defence takes 3 tricks|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|vugraphzfe: 3@H = no major, 3@S = transfer to 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: 3nt should be slam interest |pg||
nt|brolucius: I wonder if the 6-1 diamond break will help declarer in the play. Even if a diamond is led, declarer can play a spade at some stage and West will have no further diamond to play.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and not much to do here,  +/- an imp again |pg||
nt|casenjo:  I love these transfer auctions, no one has what they bid anymore, everything is artificial|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzfe: Duboin pointed out that he's going to make upon seeing dummy|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: at least these ones are easy to understand|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s8|nt|sybarra: easy for him |pg||
nt|Walddk4: He is a good player|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably about to claim |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|brolucius: North would have bid 2NT if he held four hearts. 3@C shows only three-card support.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think the play will be simple: @cA, @sA, @c ruff, and claim|pg||
nt|dburn: still, he has a chance if he can draw the right inferences from the bidding|pg||
nt|dima:  I think the contract will be made|pg||
nt|warrens:  he's got to play the @C 10 from his hand before he draws the last 2 rounds of trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D [from auction]  4@S  so either  4441 or 4144|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: some relay sequences nobody but the players know what the bids mean|pg||

nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would not help West much to duck the @SA. Declarer could win and later throw a loser on the @SQ, conceding a spade trick and setting up the @SJ for a further discard. |pg||
nt|dima:  Match is very close now |pg||
nt|dburn: well done Strul - that overcall was a solo effort, but there was nothing shabby about his play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fallenius may have a two opening for this hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Probably would hold it to 4, but not beat the contract|pg||
mb|1N|nt|brolucius: Some would double on the West hand, hoping to survive a removal if partner responded in clubs.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Something like 4@C may be a fit jump now. But they could play it as a splinter. More likely. |pg||
nt|henryb:  depends whether a conversion to @d would show extra values. Sharp division of opinion on so called "equal level conversion"|pg||
nt|brolucius: East would like to show clubs as well as diamonds, rather than name a shortage.|pg||
nt|dima:  And now Precision might place the declarership of @h contract in the wrong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C is the only strong bid for EW  [2N is artificial]|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sybarra: another "fun" hand |pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: making 4 @H |pg||
nt|dima:  OUCH|pg||
mb|2D|nt|dburn: maybe you could make a slam if you were in it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We are hoping to show two matches from tomorrow and onwards, but it depends on operator availability|pg||
nt|sybarra: Roland could |pg||
nt|ritong: aker will not like this holding in @c shortness|pg||
nt|ritong: @d singleton is not yummy either|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he has a good hand apart from that - 4@c something of an overbid, but...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If 4@H denies shortage he had no choice. It's too good for 3@H|pg||
nt|ritong: on the bright side, the ninth trump and relatively solid suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H 5+@H, game force|pg||
nt|fabsayc: gues not|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  another case of DOIGB|pg||
nt|henryb:  Down One Is Good Bridge|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ritong: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Nothing much wrong with 5@D. It is a gamble but it might cause South a problem if he had a good hand.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Of course 4@s would have been better bridge: down 2|pg||
nt|casenjo:  should Boye overtake and try to cash|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, East has not bought well, because partner is short in her second suit. That is why a fit-jump can work well, allowing partner to judge the fit.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I'm not sure East is strong enough for a fit-jump|pg||
nt|dima:  Now need to drop @c Q offside in 6NT from East - tall order|pg||
nt|dburn: lead could be changing hands here - these have been mighty blows by Strul and his cohorts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: some who play multi can open 2M with his hand type|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Brogeland|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dima:  3@s might be a serious slam try|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  a free bid of 3 clubs, followed by supporting diamonds could excite west when they do have a double fit|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, if 4@C would be a splinter, you could try 3@C.|pg||
nt|henryb:  you might have to do that at the five level|pg||
nt|casenjo:  and keep them out of trouble when they don't have the double fit|pg||
nt|henryb:  the @d support, I mean|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had East been a passed hand, most players would say that 3@C did show a diamond fit as well.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  i do|pg||
nt|brolucius: A 'support non-jump' some call it.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or balanced with no @S stop?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  They found @h fit already|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|Walddk4: 4@S kickback?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Confirmed|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok Roland make this for us !|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: East says 4@C is splinter with a good hand like 20 in hcp (?)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Fallenius has been declaring beautifully tonight, let's see how he does here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i predict he will try to ruff a heart|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk4: It's easy to make with all cards in view|pg||
nt|sybarra: sure |pg||
nt|ritong: he will think for a while|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the never are for me |pg||
nt|sybarra: (btw, I put this hand down and say "always the challenge by me pard,  gl"|pg||
nt|ritong: "natural" approach of the @ds is to ruff one, in case of drop, then decideif north follows to the third round|pg||
nt|ritong: which would not be the case|pg||
nt|ritong: but there is an other detail to cope with|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It would be a different ballgame on a spade lead|pg||
nt|ritong: the losing @s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Still, declarer has a couple of options|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Closed Room is also in 6@H on a club lead from South|pg||
nt|ritong: @c lead is more friendly|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Play finished in the open room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The players there will be having desset when this table shows up for dinner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even without the overcall - Dubinin was going to bid @H first|pg||
nt|Walddk4: dessert  even|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the trumps are a little weak however, so maybe not|pg||
pc|c7|nt|brolucius: This is a bridge match, not a marriage ceremony.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if somebody can ruff third heart with short trump he could go down|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: I am asked what Kickback is. To save space, some use a cheaper bid (4@S here) to ask for aces. It can be particularly important if a minor has been agreed when you can't afford a ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: response above the trump suit|pg||
nt|casenjo:  no pre-nup?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  but, he only has 9 tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|casenjo:  5 spades, 3  hearts and 1 club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he has heart diamond squeeze on a different layout|pg||
nt|casenjo:  he can play for 3-3 hearts, or try to ruff one in dummy|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s3|nt|henryb:  woops|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: probably the most effecient explanation i have seen Roland,  thx |pg||

nt|fabsayc: kamil may cue bid spade ace|pg||

nt|casenjo:  For those watching, that have not seen the vugraph room itself, this is a painful experience!!!! The screens are in the way, the players are in the way and the operator is trying to insert alerts and comments while following bidding and play|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ritong: now the natural version of gazzilli|pg||
nt|brolucius: North might have long hearts to bid 4@H. 5@D still shows a giant hand via the double.|pg||
nt|phil: Strul piling it on|pg||
nt|dburn: better not let them play it, then|pg||
nt|dima:  -300 is better then -620|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4NT if ace asking is commital, but it could be a spade cue bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Now the odds favor playing East for the missing @HQ. That is the Theory of Vacant Places. West has six spades to East's two, so East has more vacant places to hold the @HQ.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with 4@S as the ace asking bid|pg||
mb|5C|nt|brolucius: Again they try to make me look stupid!|pg||
nt|phil: saves about 3 IMPs here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: For some reason the score on 55 was changed so Cayne gained 10 IMPs. The 4@H= next door has been changed to 3@H+1|pg||
nt|dburn: usually 8 IMPs or so better - here, only 3 IMPs better|pg||
nt|Walddk4: HH got away with murder in the open room, entire set more or less, and if it had not been for Gromov-Dubinin at this table it could have been worse for Lynch|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i dont do those switches, they require huge amounts of discussion|pg||
nt|fabsayc: anyway 5@C is plenty high enough|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Well, these guys know their stuff, we have not had any bidding misunderstandings|pg||
nt|fabsayc: has 12 on cross ruff, but i expect a trump lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually he does not, club nine will overruff |pg||
nt|casenjo:  Bjorn can overruff with the nine and shift to a club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he needs to score both 5 and 8 of clubs for cross ruff to work|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ritong: 2@h clarifying|pg||

nt|sybarra: the 2 @H  I see |pg||

nt|ritong: i know bart bramley already had a serious look at it|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Passell is trying to beat 5D, he would make a differnt lead vs slam|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ritong: and he certainly has colleagues|pg||

nt|sybarra: 322..........ugh|pg||
nt|brolucius: I certainly thought that, somehow, they would get to 6@D. In the slam-bidding area, they more often get too high than stay low.|pg||
nt|phil: well 4225 is posible, but s/v @d is more likely for sure|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, sure - both North and South at the other table expressed varying degrees of timidity|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: indeed david|pg||
nt|Walddk4: At this point Lynch ventured a semi-psychic 1@H|pg||
nt|dburn: good for her|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easier for her to do playing Big Club|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|dburn: meanwhile, back at the bridge|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So Rigal back in it, it's not over just yet|pg||
nt|ritong: especially with +1430|pg||
nt|brolucius: When I asked Boye to explain an auction in this year's Euro championship where they had bid to 6@S missing the ace and king of trumps, he replied: 'Ah, that was a great bidding ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: problem! You must put it into the book.'  Then he explained all his thoughts to me during the bidding. A real treat.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So EW decided not to play there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=10-15|pg||
mb|3C|nt|dima:  Another potential danger|pg||
nt|caitlin: broad range |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: quite a bit in the CR |pg||
nt|dburn: making 6@s was not so shabby for the Rigal team|pg||
nt|Walddk4: David will let us know the odds for playing the spade suit for 1 loser|pg||
nt|dburn: and without the aid of Gazzilli, the Italians might not reach it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Running the queen, David?|pg||
nt|ritong: well, an inference of the gazz is that jumps are a little bit more pure|pg||
nt|dburn: no, no|pg||
nt|dburn: that is what you do with Q10876 facing A9|pg||
nt|dburn: one might almost consider that Helgemo ventured a semi-psychic 1NT - that's quite a position with a 14 count facing two bidding opponents and one passing partner|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: He liked his 14 count; I don't blame him|pg||
nt|phil: yes but he has intermediates galore and a ttrick source|pg||
nt|caitlin: 14+ good 5 card suit no psyche in my books:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: marginal whether fredin should bother with stayman|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brolucius: 2@D is alerted because they would make a Support Double on all hands containing three-card spade support.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but with a sixth card, you just play ace and another as your grandmother used to do|pg||
nt|sybarra: :) its my aunt minnie |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|casenjo:  As Henry predicted EW competed with the ghoulish distribution on board 10 and went for 800|pg||
nt|phil: but here 2@c should get you to 3N as well|pg||
nt|casenjo:  puppet stayman|pg||
nt|fabsayc: looks like this is some form of puppet stayman|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dburn: still, no one ever doubles Helgemo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=4@H and max|pg||
nt|dima:  Well opposite 2 bidding opponents it is quite a move I would say|pg||
nt|caitlin: true|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk4: and if RHO follows with the last small card, toss a coin?|pg||
nt|dburn: absolutely, Mr Gallagher. Positively, Mr Sheen.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and on this hand doesnt matter|pg||
nt|dburn: as to whether you should bid a slam with the information Duboin has at his disposal right now...|pg||
nt|sybarra: only missing the kj,  432|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is not brain surgery |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Fred Gitelman was one of the first to point out the correctness of QT8765 opposite A9; run the Q, says a Canadian spectator (don't shoot the messenger = me)|pg||
nt|dburn: ...well, only he and the Shadow know|pg||
nt|ahollan1: note that 2@D was stayman -- all other bids from Gromov would have been natural|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Meckwell has closed the gap by 1/2...down 22|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he might have tried diamond jack to gain a second entry to dummy|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|dburn: nah - Fred pointed out the correctness of running the queen with Q10876 facing A9. He and I both know that with six facing two, you should play ace and one|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: a bit less fun with club lead |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk4: KNR values it at 18, so it's not just any 14 count|pg||
nt|phil: KNR loves long strong suits and hates short honors|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dburn: not quite clear what Dubinin should do now|pg||
nt|dima:  Declarer has to be careful here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however this is probably better, tempting fleisher to cash a diamond or switch to hearts|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dburn: but this looks best|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now if he believes diamonds 5-3 he can play hearts from hand|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dima:  nice play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and loves Aces/Kings  hates Quacks|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|dburn: KNR has never been for 800 in its life. It doesn't understand these things.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Difficult to judge these hands exactly, but both sides had a nine-card fit in their minor. That suggests around 9 tricks each (or 10 and 8, or 8 and 10). So, on that basis bidding ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4 over 4 was doubtful. Particularly as North had a singleton in South's first-bid suit.|pg||

mb|3N|nt|brolucius: To open 2@H on the East hand would not be a good bid. (Two side aces). Mind you, there should not really be a gap between 1@H and 2@H, so I would open 1@H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not that game is all that much of a contract, I guess|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|casenjo:  Balicki made it easy for partner to beat 5 diamonds dbld on Board 12; he led a club|pg||

nt|ahollan1: note:  rare is a 4-letter word|pg||
nt|dburn: if I were Becker I would be a confused man by the end of this auction - ostensibly, 2NT should be a strong distributional hand that does not want to pass 1NT doubled|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: and a special thx always goes to Jan Martel for organizing the operatorts.  and to ACBL for bringing this tourney to bbo |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Strul must have taken double as conventional|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Otherwise 2NT and 3@S make no sense|pg||
nt|dburn: but Strul hasn't got one of those, so I have no idea where this will all end, except that it will all end in tears|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dima:  sporting double?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unfortunate end to a very good set for Becker-Strul|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They are not in complete agreement on which level to play at|pg||
nt|dburn: I really am not sure about all this - Becker may have concluded that Strul is two-suited (as I would) with spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|casenjo:  The Encyclopedia of Bridge has another version. Evidently there have been several variations.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and of course to all the specs,  helpful , humorous comments |pg||
nt|fabsayc: more like 100, 10 or so i have used|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brolucius: This is the last board of the set and I'm sure we would all like to thank the splendid Asya, our special VG operator. Many thanks and well done!|pg||
nt|po-s: this looks enought|pg||
nt|Walddk4: From bad to worse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still avoiding the red card  [DBL]|pg||
nt|dburn: Strul appears to believe that Becker has some other hand than a penalty double of a weak no trump|pg||
nt|dima:  the biding is not over yet :)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Is this bridge, I am asked. Well, this is extremely strange|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: Also, Jo Anne, my co-commentator. Thanks!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Last hand here thanks everyone for watching|pg||
nt|po-s: A grand seems to be too high|pg||
pc|dT|nt|dburn: Becker now hasn't got a clue what's happening, and should probably have stopped bidding|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dima:  oh well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most notable  Zaleski 99 vs Nickell 55|pg||
nt|dburn: but this is really just a misunderstanding - sad end to what has been a great effort by Strul personally; he has played some very good bridge these past two hours|pg||
nt|dima:  tough opening lead problem :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Director is being called now|pg||
nt|dburn: I thought he might be|pg||
nt|po-s: About 4 down unless he guesses wrong here and rhere|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Private messages are welcomed of course, but please don't blame ME for this disaster. I am innocent|pg||
nt|po-s: I don´t think EW should complain|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Or me!|pg||
nt|dburn: because there must have been something in Dubinin's explanation of Gromov's pass to 1NT doubled that caused Strul to go off in this wild and woolly fashion|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This does not even qualify as a Roland slam, so leave me out of it|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly Gromov's pass was alerted, but I do not know what explanation Strul had - Becker would have had the right one, but that would not help him much|pg||
nt|po-s: with a good hand or some escape start|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you should probably consider the scores on bridgewinners  unofficial for a while|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores filtering in   http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: South might not have seen the 1nt alreat?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Berkowitz-Cohen have had much success and can find out just about anything below game|pg||
nt|casenjo:  The article is the ACBL July 2010 Bulletin. I think it might be available online.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: except when to play 3nt |pg||
mc|10|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores  for all results soon|pg||
nt|casenjo:  We will see everyone for the 4th quarter!!!\|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Thanks to our vugraph operator! and organizer Jan Martel|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks operator, jo, spectators|pg||
nt|casenjo:  As well as my co-commentator, I luv ya!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: aw shucks|pg||
