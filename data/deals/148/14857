nt|ritong: well giorgio recovered|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, a gentle start to the session.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  A friendly start for the Strul team|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Norwegian pair is incredibly aggressive when looking for slams. Most people would regard them as over-aggressive in that area.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Welcome to our Canadien expert!|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Welcome back to the 4th quarter of the Spingold Round of 16|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Welcome they already started board 17|pg||
nt|casenjo:  30 Imps is not insurmountable; however, Fredin-Fallenius are playing magnificent bridge|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|frankaus: fasinating collection here|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmm  indeed |pg||
nt|ritong: he had some idea about @s Q location, since east did not cue|pg||
nt|fabsayc: Canadian, I am not french :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|casenjo:  oops! So Sorry|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brolucius: North has passed. If he were to bid, he would have used transfers over a take-out double.|pg||
nt|dima:  Hi all|pg||
nt|henryb:  A possible game for E-W, and no safe harbor for N-S|pg||
mb|d|nt|casenjo:  I was originally from Detroit, so close to Windsor that I was semi-Canadian, and do understand the difference|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Bjorn has something to think about here. It sounds to him like a pinocle deck|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|2H|nt|brolucius: 5@C is a lucky make, needing two good things to happen.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: ugh |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: or should I say "yuck" |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: vuls wrong to act|pg||
nt|casenjo:  and the expert is correct, Bjorn new the vulnerability was wrong here|pg||
nt|casenjo:  knew, not new|pg||
nt|fabsayc: besides raising would have just helped opponents who actually have missed an excellent slam|pg||
nt|casenjo:  sorry, folks, had a couple drinks at dinner, please excuse my typing|pg||
nt|casenjo:  For a change we have a straight forward auction, negative double, cue bid asking partner how good his overcall is....|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|ritong: the good old reversed two suiters|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No-one can double 3NT but it sure is a terrible contract|pg||
nt|frankaus: play missfits in 3NT is a common view|pg||
nt|brolucius: North may be considering 3NT. No, he has bid just 3@D.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Indeed; but passing 3@d by E is not appreciating how good her hand is|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was an unsuccessful bidding board for East-West. They can make 10 or 11 tricks in their best fit but have sold out to 3@D. |pg||
nt|henryb:  She was close (imo) between 2@c and 3@c on the first round|pg||
nt|dima:  Would X over 3@d be to compete some place or penalty? |pg||
nt|po-s: About an ace more than she might have had|pg||
nt|brolucius: East had two great cards for partner and had made only a forced 2@C bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: each player would rather have another pard,  if they could see all cards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: With clubs 3-2 it has *some* play, but this is awful|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to duck the @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that is easy |pg||
nt|frankaus: duboin did well to stay out of the action|pg||
nt|sybarra: your rightie opens you best suit,  easy to stay out |pg||
nt|frankaus: red light helped|pg||
nt|ritong: so this is a matter of number of undertricks|pg||
nt|frankaus: 50's :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: as pointed out to me,  then your lefty bids you next best suit,  |pg||
nt|sybarra: how does it feel now?|pg||
nt|ritong: going down less than your counterpart is also a way to win imps ( homer nods)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Neither North nor South liked their spade holdings and took the conservative road|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: with nobody wanting to quit|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Glad to have you back!!!|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: here comes a @D most likely |pg||
nt|sybarra: just make the communication a mess |pg||
nt|frankaus: u look at dummy u look at ur hand and still cant find even 6 tricks :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: 8 of @D or club?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you might hope for the clubs to break - I am not sure that Aker is contemplating suicide at this point|pg||
pc|d6|nt|frankaus: @S look probable|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a rare 3 or 7 hand|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks, you too|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Martin Johnson and Jo Anne Casen are your commentators this evening|pg||

nt|casenjo:  Our jobs are to keep you entertained and not make complete fools out of ourselves :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all at the same time?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the 4-1 spade break makes this a bit complicated|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Fleisher - Kamil have been replaced by Chip Martel and Lew Stansby; one of the longest running partnerships in North America and inventors of the "Rule of 20"|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|dburn: but at this point, perhaps...|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|brolucius: Brogeland and Saelensminde won the recent 3-day Lifemaster Pairs, here in New Orleans.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|casenjo:  Fallenius has been living in New York, but according to Roland Wald, he will now be playing for Sweden again. Nice news for the Swedes. He is a marvelous player.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|sybarra: re hi David |pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: The good news for Aker is that he won't go 4 down|pg||
pc|s7|nt|henryb:  This is the sort of hand that makes one appreciate the difficulty of playing with less experienced partners|pg||
nt|dima:  He surely ruffed middle|pg||
pc|s9|nt|po-s: appreciate Henry?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well fredin has found a winning line|pg||

nt|fabsayc: not sure why he did not play for seven, is doubtful he will get any useful info by playing the spades about whether to finesse in diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now ruff and discard assures martel gets a trump|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Very well done again!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but apparently defense went wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: has nothing to do with it|pg||
nt|casenjo:  The opening lead places those high cards with south, and north bid vulnerable. Kamil's problem is: did North bid on strength or length?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|frankaus: brb|pg||
nt|brolucius: East might have given a suit-preference signal on the first round of hearts, attempting to show the @SK to her partner.|pg||
nt|henryb:  appreciate in the sense of gaining understanding, not in the sense of getting warm feelings|pg||
nt|po-s: This is a European fight in a way; Norway against Poland/Russia|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ritong: if there ever was a horse beaten to death, it would probably be computer deals|pg||
nt|brolucius: I believe that only 3 or 4 of the top 20 seeds have an all-American squad.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  The best bridge book I ever read is Mike Lawrence's "How to Read Your Opponents' Cards"|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: All enlightenment is appreciated, Hensry|pg||
nt|warrens:  wow, helness didn't balance over 2@H but Gromov did over 3.|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|nt|sybarra: some how do not see a double coming at this table |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|henryb:  or in the sense of gaining value|pg||
nt|warrens:  this looks like it'll be expensive|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sit next to a mirror :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: all of this bids are alreated|pg||
nt|casenjo:  or place one behind the table|pg||
nt|casenjo:  That is a pretty card for Fredin to see|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the eigth trick on this lead|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not an advert for bad suit weak two bids|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|ritong: but it is so human to blame a machine rather than your own skills|pg||
nt|dburn: not quite sure why the final contract was doubled at the other table - sure, South opened the bidding, but even so...|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sybarra: and indeed we have beaten this to death,   |pg||
nt|Walddk4: It would also be unwise as the defence can't come to more than 1 heart, 2 diamonds and 1 club|pg||
nt|sybarra: are the results of round 3 posted?  so we know?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 3 hearts with only 6 is tricky|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: *do|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that actually happened to me in a regional in seattle, we were set up in the hall|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d2|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Click on Round of 32 to the left|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Roland |pg||
nt|casenjo:  The lead opens to 20, when the diamond slam was bid in the other room on Board 34|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes and after south raised spades :)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  They usually cover the mirrors in the hotel playing areas, I once played where they forgot to cover the mirrors on the ceilings.  They were on strange angles and everyone could see all of the hands.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i shift to spade 9|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|warrens:  best line looks to be to ruff a diamond and lead a small club to the 10|pg||
pc|d6|nt|brolucius: Brogeland likes an 8-11 point weak-two opening. Weaker hands are shown with a multi 2@D.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe Maksymets was anxious that his partner should lead a diamond anyway|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Fredin perfect again!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fredin on fire, has even guessed diamonds immediately|pg||
nt|casenjo:  He knows if Martel gets he he will shift to a club honor|pg||
pc|dK|nt|warrens:  :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it was sort of a safety play, but not 100%|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c4|pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: the reasoning is partner needs a diamond stopper to beat hand, and declarer wont be finessing in spades with other options|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|warrens:  I see 3 @S's, 2 @D's and 2 ruffs.  maybe an extra spade trick, but at best -500, so lose 9 imps or 12|pg||

nt|henryb:  This is actually a fair game (needs a club guess or the heart finesse|pg||
nt|po-s: David, I think four teams are all-american, but there are 43 foreigh players left, and 50 Americans, given some random decisions on Lev, Pepsi,Shivdasani, Fallenius|pg||
nt|dima:  Maybe Saelensminde could ask then? Maybe a bit different standard being nonvulnerable|pg||
nt|brolucius: I do not have their current convention card. Sometimes they use 2@D as a weak major two-suiter (possibly 4-4) in the first two seats when NV against Vul. In that case the 2@S has a ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: wider range than 8-11.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Lev and Pepsi are both full time US residents; Fallenius was, but has resumed playing for Sweden|pg||
nt|henryb:  Jaggy, I think has been laying in the US trials and not for India|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: missed up the play there i must confess|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: my apologizes|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|warrens:  e/w did well to stay out of 4@H at the other table.  this could be another swing for Strul.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|dima:  And also here strong result for EW in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: west too flat for anything beyond 3@C|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: may have stolen this one |pg||
nt|henryb:  E-W play a forcing 1@c?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Hopefully the weak notrump can be a double partial swing for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: A very borderline slam. I wonder if they will take a look at it.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  EW can make 2 spades and NS can make 3 clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: or at least bought it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: do i detect a rooting interest?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|casenjo:  Well, NS have been PERFECT...It would be nice to get the match closer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fair enough|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|casenjo:  In the other room, Strul competed with 4 clubs, over 3 diamonds and South went down in 4 their diamond contract giving 6 more imps to Strul|pg||
nt|henryb:  Personally I do not think it is very close to the border|pg||
nt|brolucius: On a diamond lead, you have to take the finesse before you have a chance to set up a discard on the clubs.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=good 12-15|pg||
nt|warrens:  I don't know exactly what 2nt shows here, but it's clearly conventional.  Some pairs use 2@S artificially here.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW used to play  Precision or Polish Club depending upon vulnerability -- it is possible they're always Precision now|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: Either way it was a really good match|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this defense is awkward for martel, as he does not know club king is a trick|pg||

nt|casenjo:  The vugraph operator's job is tough. And I believe today they are behind screens which makes it often difficult to see everything that is going on  at the table.|pg||
nt|dima:  Another strong result from Helness-Helgemo in the other room - you have to get to 4@s first|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not great but may well be bid, a lot of points|pg||

nt|ahollan1: convention card for Dubinin-Gromov from 2010 European Championship  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/russia/gromov-dubinin.pdf|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this 1nt is a game force|pg||
mb|2C|nt|brolucius: I have never tried it but I suspect that my limit would be about two deals and six tricks. Then I would get a headache and pass it over to someone else.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have yet to figure out how they bid with a normal 1nt response|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i have copy of Struhl-Becker CC from 2009 trials -- not sure if it is still online|pg||
nt|dima:  They work a lot on their system ... some changes compared to the last european championship|pg||
mb|2D|nt|dima:  Interesting Becker did not have more constructive raise available|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Dima - when did they stop flip-flopping between Precision and Polish?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Dont know exactly but they do switch a lot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D probably a random game try with @D length just a coincidence|pg||
nt|fabsayc: support double by fredin|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: Limit raise in spades, Bergen|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Now North has a huge hand within double fit|pg||
nt|dima:  So it comes to 500 at least|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can watch the other room in realtime using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|fabsayc: trump lead auction if passed out|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I tend to lead trump at low level contracts|pg||
nt|casenjo:  unless there is a glaring better lead|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzfe: Im sorry about the bidding|pg||
nt|dima:  Alex will surely swing the axe now whether 5@d or 5@h|pg||
nt|casenjo:  And at this level of play, they lead the expected|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|sybarra: sort of love hate lead,   hope that was not a single @D |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: good duck by kamil also|pg||
nt|fabsayc: leaving partner with another trump (hopefully)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Levin-Weinstein only beat 2 clubs by ONE trick, so a pickup by DeKnijff|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: since Dubinin DBLs it doesn't apply, but good point for partnerships to discuss if PASS would be forcing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all south bids are relays, no idea what fredin has shown so far|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: probably a club to king and another diamond lead now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: did i mention the 5 minute think?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Rip Van Winkle Coup|pg||
nt|casenjo:  sit there long enuf that the opponents go to sleep|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 7NT actually looks slightly better than 7@D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it could survive with club jack third even if diamonds dont run|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: showing 19+ a 5-4-3-1 hand and 2 key cards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what about the critical diamond queen|pg||
mb|6D|nt|ahollan1: many play that forcing PASS applies only if he'd bid something stronger than 4@S on last round|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: and S has no @S.....I am sure Aker is pondering entire hand now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He must keep @SQ in dummy, then he should be OK|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I meant worrisome lead from declarers point of view originally,  not now |pg||
nt|ritong: i m not sure what his worries are|pg||
nt|ritong: what can happen if he plays a @h now?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That North wins and continues clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: keep to 2 more losers and make 4   |pg||
nt|ritong: well, @c K|pg||
nt|ritong: @d Q overtake|pg||
nt|ritong: after cashing @h Q|pg||
nt|brolucius: I like to spend around 10 seconds of every minute (at least) half-asleep. This is not a prime requirement for being a VG operator.|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  Weinstein and Levin limped into 6 diamonds after a misunderstood keycard auction|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a kickback misunderstanding?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  South showed a powerhouse and then bid 4NT, signed off in 6 diamonds, thinking he was off a keycard.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|casenjo:  North never showed his huge hand and just bid 6.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|henryb:  good contract, although unsuccessful|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|dburn: that might fail against a desperately unlucky 2-2 trump break - this is not straightforward|pg||
nt|casenjo:  That does not happen at this level of play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i expect to be wrong after that much thinking|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: well it is only a 50-50 grand slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but a missed opportunity|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: n/s trying to tangle him up |pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, he saw south discarding on the first round|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Now west is thinking, :what was south thinking"|pg||
nt|casenjo:  East had overcalled 2 spades, so the auction: 1D - 1S - 2S by south. When Levin bid 4NT I think he assumed that diamonds were trump and Weinstein showed only one keycard, not thinking that the king of diamonds was a keycard|pg||

nt|dima:  Looks like polish methods - low from doubleton|pg||

nt|fabsayc: so it was blackwood versus keycard, another unsettled problem |pg||
mb|1N|nt|po-s: We wouldn´t dream of it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many eastern europeans lead low from small doubleton, but that isn't how their CC is marked [going back to 2008 world championships]|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i play all keycard if we have bid even one suit|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Yes, but they have played long enough to know that a cuebid followed by 4NT immediately shows support for opener|pg||

mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: so they knew they were missing the queen and settled for 6|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this looks almost inevitable to be bid now|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Many 2/1 players abuse clubs when they want to force to game, but would liketo hear more rather than jumpto 3NT|pg||

nt|fabsayc: well this time the weak no trump has worked|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|henryb:  Who wants to watch the other table when Boye and Eric are here|pg||
nt|casenjo:  no 1D-2S-3S-P-4H-P-4NT; Levin made 2 bids, spade cuebid and 4NT|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||

nt|henryb:  That assumes, David, that your estimate of 83% sensible comments is accurate|pg||

mb|2D|nt|dima:  Some action again here|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Gromov choices are P, 4@S, RDBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Helness started with PASS but let them off the hook later in the auction|pg||
nt|dima:  East hand looks like a lot of defence and he faces 2nd seat VUL preempt|pg||
nt|casenjo:  North can make a slam here, south gets a heart lead through and goes down|pg||
nt|casenjo:  But, will they get that high?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  P.O. Stay! there is no other table to watch|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|casenjo:  Or will they play in diamonds or NT from the north?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Maybe I can find a document with 28 pages of Gazzilli system notes|pg||
nt|sybarra: "accepting the transfer with a good hand |pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.acbl.org/nabc/bulletins/2010/02/6/  pages 8&9 for team rosters|pg||
nt|brolucius: South buys a great dummy, just as his partner did on the previous deal.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6D from north is best, again not great but clearly an opportunity for the trailing team|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  A good point to discuss with your reg partner, most play XX = pls stay out of my way|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Xmas arrives and 2@s trick go through to boot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 philosophies   1 says if pure defensive hands  PASS then DBL  so that RDBL then DBL is more cooperative|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other says RDBL first to enlist partner  but RDBL/DBL says PEN|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it helps to be on same page as partner :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  The heat is on - now they might get to @d|pg||

nt|ahollan1: our comments crossed in the ether Dima|pg||
nt|dima:  happens from time to time :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either  a) assume more likely 5@D than 5@H  OR  b) bid 4@H because it is game|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 15-17|pg||
pc|c2|nt|casenjo:  24 imps have been gained by NS when EW misread slam hands; Board 34 6 diamonds was made in the other room and on 38 they stopped in game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense signal problem here|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|dima:  This rather about the first digit in front of 00|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right - i was just trying to come up with any rationale for Strul making a choice|pg||
nt|dima:  And Alexander Dubinin comes to help with @d - lovely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would North bid the same way with 4@H 5@D?|pg||
nt|dima:  Strul is going to have some more grey hair till this board is over|pg||
nt|dima:  I think one MIGHT bid 4@d with 5@d and 4@h as some kibs point out|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: I think it is unclear since there is always a [slim] chance that partner won't be able to bid EITHER red suit|pg||
nt|dima:  Oh well now one still has to play the hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: South could easily be  3226|pg||
pc|s4|nt|dima:  With that it might be more prudent to run from 4@c XX to 5@c :)|pg||
nt|dima:  And they will get a @h ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with natural trump trick isn't it?|pg||
nt|dima:  So let's see - 2@s + 1@c + 2@h + 1@d that is 800 to begin with|pg||
nt|dburn: that may be all - not so bad|pg||
nt|dima:  could be worse from Strul's perspective :)|pg||
nt|dburn: but hearts would have been better - perhaps not really possible to get to those, since Strul wasn't allowed to reredouble 4@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: while we ponder I'd like to retract an earlier statement of mine   Gromov-Dubinin have always played Precision throughout   i was thinking of a different pair [martens-jassem] who ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: play Precision or Polish depending upon vul|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: NS play udca so in principle fallenius diamond was encouraging|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|dburn: and South drove to game with a nondescript seven count? boy, these guys are tough|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: however fredin knows any diamond tricks are not disappearing so he goes passive|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dima:  Gromov-Dubinin play variable NT - 12+-15 in 1/2 and 15-17 in 3/4th|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgeguys.com/pdf/GazzilliND.pdf  for a longer version of Gazzilli, 18 pages. Worth reading if you have nothing better to do|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not a very productive 24-count, partly because both hands are 4-3-3-3.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And the way the broadcast is set up, Asya can't enter results from the other room|pg||
nt|henryb:  and no suits break|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT 18-19.|pg||
nt|dima:  Who needs spades :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oops|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, if you want to score plus 420 instead of plus 110, you need spades - and you need to bid them|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kamil is either also bidding tactically or not on same wavelength|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in modern bridge we alert all natural bids (sarcastically)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 4+@D, unbal    they open weak NT with 44441@D|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|ritong: i second that|pg||
nt|sybarra: she was Dorothy Hayden then,  thx Joost |pg||
nt|ritong: a friendly dummy to come|pg||
nt|brolucius: Is it possible for Brogeland to show restraint ever? No!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I will get results from someone sooner or later|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is a contract even I can make, also at 4:55 am. 6 hearts and 2 spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: I said joost,  meant Jack Oest    |pg||
nt|casenjo:  I'm surprised at Kamil, it is pretty normal to have support for spades on this auction, since west is  a passed hand, he didn;t open 2 hearts....|pg||
nt|pelu: so it looks like a lot of european players in the round of 8|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: maybe he figured anything undoubled was ok|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|brolucius: We will see if Erik can make bricks out of straw.|pg||
nt|dima:  Probably did not like the idea of having to find a bid after 1@d - 1@s - 2@d - ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C was 6+@C, 9-11 HCP|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|casenjo:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: didnt mean to click alreat|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h6|pc|cT|nt|brolucius: No hurry to test the hearts, clearly. Instead declarer tries to make something of the diamonds.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It will take a while|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, indeed he didn't, and I have a lot of sympathy with the choice of 3@c|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: interesting that neither pair could find the @S fit|pg||

nt|sybarra: some day in the future, the USA will adopt running scores..............|pg||
nt|ritong: the top spot is 6NT by north|pg||
nt|ritong: and certainly antonio sementa will consider this option in fine|pg||
nt|ritong: because of his stranded @hK|pg||
nt|sybarra: so where do you start the bidding with N?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C I presume|pg||
nt|ritong: looks like a game forcing hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: and looking at E hand, I sympathize,  like my rubber bridge hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: I would start with 2 @C |pg||
nt|po-s: Aha, that´s why you call the raise to 3NT "normal" - never say anything negative about a co-author|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Eric made his bricks out of straw|pg||
nt|brolucius: I always used to admire the English player Robert Sheehan. He would write articles in Bridge Magazine with such asL 'Flint and I got into a terrible mess on this deal...'.  I was ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: so impressed! It made me think: Wow! He must be some player if he can put his mistakes into print. |pg||
nt|jtr: @h|pg||
nt|brolucius: Sally Brock wrote a book that included several deals that had not gone well. She had my admiration for it. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: okay i have some results from the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: board 3 4 spades by south making 5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: board 4- 3 no trump by west making 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: board 5- 5hearts doubled by west down 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: board 6 are playin 3sp by east|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6-7 IMPs to be added|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told: Good players should be able to do that. in "My 60 memorable games" chess champion Bobby Fisher included several of his own defeats too.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The open room is back now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: However, the tables are not linked so that won't help a lot as far as comparisons are concerned|pg||
nt|jtr: He seems lovely|pg||
nt|casenjo:  it appears to be 17-6 Strul after the first 5 boards|pg||
nt|jtr: Sry |pg||
nt|brolucius: I am tempted to predict that this will be the world's flattest 3NT. We will see.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  You are bold, I'm rarely tempted to predict|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even Reese was self-deprecating at times. 'I am about to play a diamond when, at the last minute, I realise that...'|pg||
nt|dima:  The bidding was the same|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, 4@s wasn;'t cold, but it would have been more interesting to watch than 3@c|pg||
nt|dburn: still, at least Gromov played it quickly|pg||
nt|dima:  THAT is true :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the only difference is that Helgemo's 1@D was 4+ but could have been balanced|pg||
nt|dima:  And playing Precision you dont have a lot of power to make 4@s after opening at most 24 points so go with 7-card suit|pg||
nt|dima:  I think Reese called those 7411 girafe hands or so|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: quick break|pg||
nt|dima:  Kibs suggest swans and cologne :)|pg||
nt|dburn: both correct|pg||
nt|dima:  In any case Reese claimed that those hands should be played in 7-card suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the range for NS weak 2s is 6-12   it's been a long long time since i've seen that range|pg||
nt|casenjo:  This will be another push.Fleisher needs to pick up 32 imps in 8 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: may depend on vulnerability to an extent|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, if North can have 12 then South should bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the only qualifier on their CC is  "may be light 3rd favorable vul"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i know is not a popular view, but i go for swings on every board at this stage|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: When you have put your foot into it 50 times, you cease worrying about the 51st time.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk4: Tables are linked now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Open room operator catching up|pg||
nt|dima:  Try :)|pg||
nt|dburn: and if South bids, North may take the view that his 6-4 shape entitles him to show a maximum|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: standing after 3. segment: http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I was surprised that the other room didn't bid 7D on 53 or 6D on 55|pg||
mb|1H|nt|dima:  Would not MANY of us think it is maximum even within 6-12 range|pg||
nt|dburn: and if all of that comes to pass, North-South will reach a pushy game that they will not make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: CC doesn't describe replies to 2N :(|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|brolucius: Common to play transfer responses opposite 1@C nowadays|pg||
nt|casenjo:  They know they need it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: first step OK right sided NTs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: exactly|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Dawson Mahaffey and the DIamond match were both only 4 imp differences going into the 4th quarter|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dburn: artificiality follows, as they say|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: hang on a minute - I hadn't thought of that game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: best line now looks to be win diamond,draw two trumps then play diamonds|pg||
nt|casenjo:  South shouldl not anticipate anything strange|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brolucius: 2@C is check-back, looking for a spade or heart fit.|pg||
nt|dima:  Apparently neither did Becker :)|pg||
nt|dburn: neither had Becker, though I am not sure he was allowed to overrule his partner - depends on the details of their agreements|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: now aren't you glad you're wearing your seat belts?|pg||
nt|dima:  Maybe the rules are: direct 3NT = shut up, 2NT+3NT = allowed to think?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not keen on 3@H, prefer 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  The opponents hold 18 HCP and 10 hearts and never entered the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  me too, i like to bid what i have, especially which such great spots in spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond jack lead may set this|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Sometimes the Moysian fit is right, both 3NT and 4 spades work on this hand|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dburn: I guess West would lead a club against 3NT, and in practice it would not make either|pg||
nt|pelu: big problems with communication|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fredin can duck spades twice and then i count only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|casenjo:  The opponents can take 2 diamonds and 2 aces|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and the last trick|pg||
nt|pelu: but are there 9 tricks for decl?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  south only has 2 clubs, he will probably have togive stansby the heart and spade in dummy|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: @h lead to save an imp|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 2NT=asking, usually balanced|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 3@D=1 suiter in spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 3@H=At least 1 top honour in spades, 3@S=6+@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see I have made one of my famous incorrect comments. 1@C was not natural and 1@H is part of their system responses.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I think 3 hearts is Smolen, 4 hearts, 5 spades|pg||
pc|d5|nt|brolucius: I am told they are playing 'a sort of Blue Club'.|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think actually the defense is easy, declarer almost certainly has the actual shape|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: I am glad they wrote this out for you Andy,  we were slightly lost |pg||
nt|dburn: not actually clear that 6NT by North is best - maybe 6@s by North is better|pg||
nt|dima:  Hmmm can declarer drop @h King now?|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess at double dummy this may have a chance also, but in practice I doubt very much that Becker will make it|pg||
pc|h4|nt|brolucius: Well, at least my prediction of 'world's most obvious 3NT' did not go down the chute. Not that I was sticking my neck out very far with that. |pg||
nt|casenjo:  So,it would appear things are splitting|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes suggests even breaks|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: mind you he has knocked out the right ace|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can now get home|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|ritong: mm|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ritong: going down in 6NT means @ss5/0 offfside|pg||
pc|s8|nt|dburn: that's his normal play for sure|pg||
nt|dima:  low @h now?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: dropping the singleton K wouldn't have worked anyway|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: are e/w even going to get ace of @H?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ritong: plus bad luck in @ds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even if south wins declarer has nine this way|pg||
nt|casenjo:  i see down 1 now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dima:  Getting maximum out of it|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dburn: sure it would - two top spades, three more rounds of hearts and West is down to all clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still loses one trump|pg||
pc|c5|nt|casenjo:  he has now forced them to break clubs for him,,guaranteeing his contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this costs a dummy entry and gives up on establishing diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but it does force them in some layouts to break clubs|pg||
nt|casenjo:  but he cannot go down now, on any lie of the cards|pg||
nt|casenjo:  nicely done by Bjorn|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|ritong: when going down in 6@s simply happens with a @h ruff|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|pelu: we can see all 52 cards - and we are not sure - and decl - and defense only 16 - diff for them|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|nt|brolucius: If a spade switch comes, North must withhold the @SQ.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He can place East with the @SK on the bidding.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i was right to start with, he simply does not have 9 tricks|pg||

nt|ahollan1: oh sorry -- looking at trump in isolation|pg||

mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: and forgot pulled 3N to 4@H  --  i'll go back to sleep now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+@D, unbal, 11-15|pg||
nt|dima:  Nicely defended - @d lead does not look automatic on the bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|brolucius: West might have employed Michaels (2@H to show spades and a minor). That is not good when you have six spades and five in the minor, but OK when the suits are this way round.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Passell may wind up going for a large number|pg||
nt|dima:  NS may find a way to 4@h now|pg||

mb|2D|nt|sybarra: floppying to 3 nt again |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Everything's well now. Scoreline correct|pg||
nt|casenjo:  3NT is a much easier contract than 4Hearts|pg||
nt|brolucius: On hand 8, where North made 400 here. They went one down in 2NT (as you would expect) at the other table, for a 10 IMP swing.|pg||
nt|henryb:  but 4@sX might be even better|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: what to bid in W : 4@c?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|casenjo:  looking for action?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C agrees hearts and 3@S shows a shortage.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I thought that if South bid a simple 4@h Passell might bid 4@s|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Grant Baze: "6-5 come alive"|pg||
nt|dima:  True|pg||
nt|dburn: may or may not be a good time for the dread four-card-suit overcall|pg||
nt|dima:  This will take some handling|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a good slam in trailing team terms|pg||
nt|casenjo:  yes, a possible place to pickup|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not cold but good enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the fact that 1@D is always unbal will help Strul with @C|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@h isn't at all a bad contract, but the breaks aren't great|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still is hard to imagine an auction that will reach it|pg||
mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: transfer response to 1@C, and 2@D artificial game force|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe had stansby bid 4@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South's hand was too slam-worthy for Brogeland to bid 4@H, probably. 3NT will show no shortage.|pg||
nt|dima:  I think Strul will have a good picture after defence takes 3 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: dont u like my 4@c?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: have not seen it yet|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh what is 4c, would be splinter for me|pg||
mb|5D|nt|casenjo:  A long time ago, in the semi-finals of the Wagar, I correctly calculated that we were trailing going into the last board, so I put my partner in 6 spades, they led their ace and she claimed and we went on to win the match by 4 and the event|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: 3@H = no major, 3@S = transfer to 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  They did not bid the slam at the other table, it was VERY skinny|pg||
nt|fabsayc: were you captain?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzfe: 3nt should be slam interest |pg||
nt|brolucius: I wonder if the 6-1 diamond break will help declarer in the play. Even if a diamond is led, declarer can play a spade at some stage and West will have no further diamond to play.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  No, Woolsey|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: and not much to do here,  +/- an imp again |pg||
nt|casenjo:  I love these transfer auctions, no one has what they bid anymore, everything is artificial|pg||
nt|casenjo:  It was in the bulletin this week, if you dug way down to look at past winners, but who cares about past winners?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzfe: Duboin pointed out that he's going to make upon seeing dummy|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: at least these ones are easy to understand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is easier to do if captain, otherwise you sort of need a lisence|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dima:  spades must be 4-4, diamonds 4-4, @h 4-1 so ...|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy for him |pg||
nt|Walddk4: He is a good player|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably about to claim |pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: North would have bid 2NT if he held four hearts. 3@C shows only three-card support.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think the play will be simple: @cA, @sA, @c ruff, and claim|pg||
nt|dburn: still, he has a chance if he can draw the right inferences from the bidding|pg||
nt|dima:  I think the contract will be made|pg||
nt|warrens:  he's got to play the @C 10 from his hand before he draws the last 2 rounds of trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D [from auction]  4@S  so either  4441 or 4144|pg||
pc|d9|nt|fabsayc: some relay sequences nobody but the players know what the bids mean|pg||

nt|brolucius: Something like 4@C may be a fit jump now. But they could play it as a splinter. More likely. |pg||
nt|henryb:  depends whether a conversion to @d would show extra values. Sharp division of opinion on so called "equal level conversion"|pg||
nt|brolucius: East would like to show clubs as well as diamonds, rather than name a shortage.|pg||
nt|dima:  And now Precision might place the declarership of @h contract in the wrong hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@C is the only strong bid for EW  [2N is artificial]|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: another "fun" hand |pg||
nt|dima:  Oh but we get @s overcall sirely|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sybarra: making 4 @H |pg||
nt|dima:  OUCH|pg||
mb|4C|nt|dburn: maybe you could make a slam if you were in it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We are hoping to show two matches from tomorrow and onwards, but it depends on operator availability|pg||
nt|sybarra: Roland could |pg||
nt|ritong: aker will not like this holding in @c shortness|pg||
nt|ritong: @d singleton is not yummy either|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he has a good hand apart from that - 4@c something of an overbid, but...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If 4@H denies shortage he had no choice. It's too good for 3@H|pg||
nt|ritong: on the bright side, the ninth trump and relatively solid suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H 5+@H, game force|pg||
nt|fabsayc: gues not|pg||
nt|pelu: S has to find the @D-lead against 6@s - @dQ go on @h|pg||
mb|4S|nt|henryb:  another case of DOIGB|pg||
nt|henryb:  Down One Is Good Bridge|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I don't like that bid, 2 diamonds was cheap|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Nothing much wrong with 5@D. It is a gamble but it might cause South a problem if he had a good hand.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Of course 4@s would have been better bridge: down 2|pg||
nt|casenjo:  should Boye overtake and try to cash|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, East has not bought well, because partner is short in her second suit. That is why a fit-jump can work well, allowing partner to judge the fit.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I'm not sure East is strong enough for a fit-jump|pg||
nt|dima:  Now need to drop @c Q offside in 6NT from East - tall order|pg||
nt|dburn: lead could be changing hands here - these have been mighty blows by Strul and his cohorts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: some who play multi can open 2M with his hand type|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Brogeland|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  3@s might be a serious slam try|pg||
pc|c5|nt|casenjo:  a free bid of 3 clubs, followed by supporting diamonds could excite west when they do have a double fit|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, if 4@C would be a splinter, you could try 3@C.|pg||
nt|henryb:  you might have to do that at the five level|pg||
nt|casenjo:  and keep them out of trouble when they don't have the double fit|pg||
nt|henryb:  the @d support, I mean|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had East been a passed hand, most players would say that 3@C did show a diamond fit as well.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  i do|pg||
nt|brolucius: A 'support non-jump' some call it.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or balanced with no @S stop?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Another miss opportunity|pg||
nt|pelu: agree Jo Anne|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dima:  They found @h fit already|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@S kickback?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Confirmed|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok Roland make this for us !|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: East says 4@C is splinter with a good hand like 20 in hcp (?)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Fallenius has been declaring beautifully tonight, let's see how he does here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i predict he will try to ruff a heart|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: It's easy to make with all cards in view|pg||
nt|sybarra: sure |pg||
nt|ritong: he will think for a while|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the never are for me |pg||
nt|sybarra: (btw, I put this hand down and say "always the challenge by me pard,  gl"|pg||
nt|ritong: "natural" approach of the @ds is to ruff one, in case of drop, then decideif north follows to the third round|pg||
nt|ritong: which would not be the case|pg||
nt|ritong: but there is an other detail to cope with|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It would be a different ballgame on a spade lead|pg||
nt|ritong: the losing @s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Still, declarer has a couple of options|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Closed Room is also in 6@H on a club lead from South|pg||
nt|ritong: @c lead is more friendly|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|casenjo:  looks like a good place for trick  10|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|dima:  And the match has a new leader|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Play finished in the open room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The players there will be having desset when this table shows up for dinner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even without the overcall - Dubinin was going to bid @H first|pg||
nt|Walddk4: dessert  even|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the trumps are a little weak however, so maybe not|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: This is a bridge match, not a marriage ceremony.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: if somebody can ruff third heart with short trump he could go down|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|nt|Walddk4: I am asked what Kickback is. To save space, some use a cheaper bid (4@S here) to ask for aces. It can be particularly important if a minor has been agreed when you can't afford a ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: response above the trump suit|pg||
nt|casenjo:  no pre-nup?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  but, he only has 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|casenjo:  5 spades, 3  hearts and 1 club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he has heart diamond squeeze on a different layout|pg||
nt|casenjo:  he can play for 3-3 hearts, or try to ruff one in dummy|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|henryb:  woops|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|dQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably the most effecient explanation i have seen Roland,  thx |pg||
mc|12|nt|brolucius: Strul went down in 3NT on the deal that I predicted would be boringly flat in 3NT. That is a high price to pay, just to make me look stupid. |pg||

nt|casenjo:  play was t oo fast for VG operator|pg||

nt|fabsayc: probably top spades in dummy, then heart ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  I'm too pedestrian, I would have overtaken trick one and tried to cash my aces :(|pg||
nt|brolucius: South went to bed with the @CA...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Don't they have a hot-dog stand?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hot-dog in New Orleans?  sounds blasphemous|pg||
mb|1C|nt|phil: yes, I'm sure thats the collective choice of the Lynch team :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: spade over call   |pg||
nt|sybarra: ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not a good idea with almost 2000 kibs and several commentators sitting like vultures on a branch, watching your every move.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Might try 5@D?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  a player messaged me "a 6D PUNT!?"|pg||
nt|brolucius: A tricky bid, anyway.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I answered: this would be the hand for it|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think I would bid 3@s, then 5@d|pg||
nt|brolucius: If he bids 5@D, North will bid 6@D. A vulnerable 5@D bid deserves respect and they HATE missing a slam.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|3D|nt|dima:  E was allowed toplay in 2@h .. and NS are close to 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@s easy - NS even make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|casenjo:  There were lots of imps to be had this quarter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|sybarra: disciplined jeff |pg||
nt|casenjo:  that jump might be enough to turn Boye on|pg||
nt|Walddk4: close?|pg||
nt|caitlin: wd|pg||
nt|dima:  Now they are IN :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It will take some effort to go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I am doing my best!|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  If North bids 4@h, South will almost surely try 6@d|pg||
nt|reisig: 16 X 4 = 64|pg||
nt|casenjo:  i'm with you henry, but Boye thought otherwise|pg||
nt|brolucius: 50-50 now that North will add a sixth diamond.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I too am often wrong|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I still like your bid after the jump to game|pg||
mb|4D|nt|casenjo:  you are TERRIFIC!!!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: np, your doing fine|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: :)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Are you perched on a stool above the table, craning your neck to see what is going on?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kamil may cue bid spade ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: and im trying to hear but i cant hear anything|pg||
nt|casenjo:  For those watching, that have not seen the vugraph room itself, this is a painful experience!!!! The screens are in the way, the players are in the way and the operator is trying to insert alerts and comments while following bidding and play|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: now the natural version of gazzilli|pg||
nt|brolucius: North might have long hearts to bid 4@H. 5@D still shows a giant hand via the double.|pg||
nt|phil: Strul piling it on|pg||
nt|dburn: better not let them play it, then|pg||
nt|dima:  -300 is better then -620|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4NT if ace asking is commital, but it could be a spade cue bid|pg||
mb|4H|nt|brolucius: Now the odds favor playing East for the missing @HQ. That is the Theory of Vacant Places. West has six spades to East's two, so East has more vacant places to hold the @HQ.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with 4@S as the ace asking bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Again they try to make me look stupid!|pg||
nt|phil: saves about 3 IMPs here|pg||
nt|pelu: also 4@s on 59 in OR - and @c-lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another marginal slam, normally just what you want when trailing|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk4: For some reason the score on 55 was changed so Cayne gained 10 IMPs. The 4@H= next door has been changed to 3@H+1|pg||
nt|dburn: usually 8 IMPs or so better - here, only 3 IMPs better|pg||
nt|Walddk4: HH got away with murder in the open room, entire set more or less, and if it had not been for Gromov-Dubinin at this table it could have been worse for Lynch|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i dont do those switches, they require huge amounts of discussion|pg||
nt|fabsayc: anyway 5@C is plenty high enough|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Well, these guys know their stuff, we have not had any bidding misunderstandings|pg||
nt|fabsayc: has 12 on cross ruff, but i expect a trump lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually he does not, club nine will overruff |pg||
nt|casenjo:  Bjorn can overruff with the nine and shift to a club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he needs to score both 5 and 8 of clubs for cross ruff to work|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: 2@h clarifying|pg||
nt|sybarra: so how do they tell difference?|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 2 @H  I see |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Gazzilli strikes for the second time in this set|pg||
nt|ritong: lauria s overcall with the boss suit makes it a little different|pg||
nt|sybarra: perhaps it is time for USA to take a look at this!!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And the match is virtually over with this one and after the change on 55|pg||
nt|ritong: i know bart bramley already had a serious look at it|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Passell is trying to beat 5D, he would make a differnt lead vs slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this one sucks, but it makes|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: and he certainly has colleagues|pg||
nt|dburn: used to be called Cole in the old days|pg||
nt|sybarra: so David what made it Gazilli?|pg||
nt|ritong: the name of its creator|pg||
nt|ritong: in italy|pg||
nt|casenjo:  there was one that needed trump 2-2 and an ace onside: not a good slam, but it was there for the desperate ones|pg||
nt|pelu: the best slam is 6@c - no danger of @C-ruff|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|po-s: beter not return a club...|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|dima:  Now @c Ace is safe|pg||
nt|dburn: wasn't all that clear for North to bid 2@s, as Passell did, but if 2@h had come back to South (as it did at the other table) Strul would probably have had another go|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: Cole is not as comprehensive as Gazzilli|pg||

nt|dburn: Bill Cole lived in Italy?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can ruff two diamonds high to assure making|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is the key moment|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk4: You can also have the version with 89 pages if you wish|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Boye would have found the heart queen anyway and made 6|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|phil: may not get the entire count on the hand for the trump play|pg||
nt|casenjo:  nice play|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe not 2@S, David, but double would not have been an overbid to show some life. After all, partner overcalled at the 2-level vulnerable vs not|pg||
nt|dima:  Well spades are 5-4 (no weak 2) at least 5 clubs (usually 6) and @h K per inference - enough|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, you have to count tricks carefully|pg||

nt|sybarra: 322..........ugh|pg||
nt|brolucius: I certainly thought that, somehow, they would get to 6@D. In the slam-bidding area, they more often get too high than stay low.|pg||
nt|phil: well 4225 is posible, but s/v @d is more likely for sure|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, sure - both North and South at the other table expressed varying degrees of timidity|pg||
nt|pelu: was that the best play? - if @cs dont work - better only to take 2x @s|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|caitlin: indeed david|pg||
nt|Walddk4: At this point Lynch ventured a semi-psychic 1@H|pg||
nt|dburn: good for her|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easier for her to do playing Big Club|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pelu: 5@d by West has a - small - chance - 4@S by NS also a chance|pg||

nt|pelu: or|pg||
mb|5D|nt|dburn: meanwhile, back at the bridge|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So Rigal back in it, it's not over just yet|pg||
nt|ritong: especially with +1430|pg||
nt|brolucius: When I asked Boye to explain an auction in this year's Euro championship where they had bid to 6@S missing the ace and king of trumps, he replied: 'Ah, that was a great bidding ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: problem! You must put it into the book.'  Then he explained all his thoughts to me during the bidding. A real treat.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So EW decided not to play there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=10-15|pg||
nt|fabsayc: looks weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Another potential danger|pg||
nt|caitlin: broad range |pg||
nt|casenjo:  too good for a preempt wiith the singleton ace and not quite enough for Bergen, so he made an aggressive choice vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: quite a bit in the CR |pg||
nt|dburn: making 6@s was not so shabby for the Rigal team|pg||
nt|Walddk4: David will let us know the odds for playing the spade suit for 1 loser|pg||
nt|dburn: and without the aid of Gazzilli, the Italians might not reach it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Running the queen, David?|pg||
nt|ritong: well, an inference of the gazz is that jumps are a little bit more pure|pg||
nt|dburn: no, no|pg||
nt|dburn: that is what you do with Q10876 facing A9|pg||
nt|dburn: one might almost consider that Helgemo ventured a semi-psychic 1NT - that's quite a position with a 14 count facing two bidding opponents and one passing partner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lots of partnerships invert the 3@C or 3@D bids, and the double may also change the meanings|pg||
nt|casenjo:  true|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|Walddk4: He liked his 14 count; I don't blame him|pg||
nt|phil: yes but he has intermediates galore and a ttrick source|pg||
nt|caitlin: 14+ good 5 card suit no psyche in my books:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: marginal whether fredin should bother with stayman|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brolucius: 2@D is alerted because they would make a Support Double on all hands containing three-card spade support.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|dburn: but with a sixth card, you just play ace and another as your grandmother used to do|pg||
nt|sybarra: :) its my aunt minnie |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|pelu: just the lead decl need|pg||
pc|h3|nt|casenjo:  As Henry predicted EW competed with the ghoulish distribution on board 10 and went for 800|pg||
nt|phil: but here 2@c should get you to 3N as well|pg||
nt|casenjo:  puppet stayman|pg||
nt|fabsayc: looks like this is some form of puppet stayman|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dburn: still, no one ever doubles Helgemo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=4@H and max|pg||
nt|dima:  Well opposite 2 bidding opponents it is quite a move I would say|pg||
nt|caitlin: true|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk4: and if RHO follows with the last small card, toss a coin?|pg||
nt|dburn: absolutely, Mr Gallagher. Positively, Mr Sheen.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and on this hand doesnt matter|pg||
nt|dburn: as to whether you should bid a slam with the information Duboin has at his disposal right now...|pg||
nt|sybarra: only missing the kj,  432|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is not brain surgery |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Fred Gitelman was one of the first to point out the correctness of QT8765 opposite A9; run the Q, says a Canadian spectator (don't shoot the messenger = me)|pg||
nt|dburn: ...well, only he and the Shadow know|pg||
nt|ahollan1: note that 2@D was stayman -- all other bids from Gromov would have been natural|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well only a diamond lead beats for sure, not easy|pg||
pc|dK|nt|casenjo:  Meckwell has closed the gap by 1/2...down 22|pg||

mb|3H|nt|pelu: the E hand dont look like minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  Balicki made it easy for partner to beat 5 diamonds dbld on Board 12; he led a club|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's pass tells partner that he has only two spades to fit the suit shown by the transfer response. |pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores  for scores in all matches after 16 boards|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: is 3nt an unspecified singleton?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: I wonder if Redouble by North would have been a re-transfer?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  3C=minimum, 3D=non min with shortness and 3H, 3S or 3NT vary on partnership agreement|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok your guess is?|pg||
nt|pelu: no better than u :)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Wed don't know which match(es) we will be showing after the dinner break. The only thing to do is turn up and see|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|brolucius: With a weak trump holding, declarer attacks one of the side suits.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: results for Wagar [Ladies KO] get posted at http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2010/02/wagar/|pg||

nt|ahollan1: there is possibility that there will be 4 vugraph tables tonight - either both from spingold [if close matches] or 1 match from each event|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk4: As long as you are back for Finland in 2hrs and 40 mins|pg||

pc|s6|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s5|pc|c2|nt|brolucius: A heart now will free up a potential winner in that suit.|pg||

pc|h9|pg||
nt|brolucius: A diamond will let it through.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Depending on operator availability|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or - if not enough vugraph operators available -- just one spingold match|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|brolucius: Well defended!|pg||

nt|pelu: ok a grand now|pg||
nt|casenjo:  7 cluba|pg||
nt|pelu: even 7NT|pg||
nt|casenjo:  7 clubs? 7 spades? 7 NT?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  take your pick|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: OR in 7@c|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: stansby-martel play something like that, i found it difficult to use|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Andy to we  have any other scores?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|dburn: another four-card-suit overcall - this one not as successful, by the looks of it|pg||
nt|casenjo:  COhen=Berkowitz play 3H =non min any 5-4-2-2- distribution, 3S= non min with 6+ suit, 3NT - non minimum 5-3-3-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: four final results posted: Nickell 112 v Ventin 57...  Zaleski 158 v Tx Aces 87...   Meltzer 183 v Senior (34) 108... and Fleisher 173 v Sutherlin 95|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Sorry, unfortunately I haven't got any extra hands for other scores, but Roland seems to have them :)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: incredible boards and 0 fireworks|pg||
nt|casenjo:  agreed....amazing|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: Passell was lucky to escape unscathed here I think|pg||
nt|phil: supposedly NS play that South's 2@c call promised 4 trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one of the rare times that natural bidders open, but precision pair passes|pg||
nt|casenjo:  we should hear 3 clubs now|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|casenjo:  that's my bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: wd :):)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I bid where I live|pg||
nt|casenjo:  i believe captaincy is a rare thing|pg||
nt|casenjo:  the best bidding: describe your hand to the best of your ability and together get to the best contract|pg||
mb|4D|nt|dburn: well, it's an uncomfortable opening for West playing strong club - less so playing that 1@c shows clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: obviously you have not used a relay system, the philosophy is quite different|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@d= cue or RKC?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I think it is RKC|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6542 is not a suit, so if natural i rebid 2@S, not 2@H|pg||
nt|pelu: that the reason that I has never played relay-system :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all it is a hand worth staying in at poker|pg||
nt|casenjo:  When relays come up, or if someone opens a NT range at any level, where their hand is narrowly defined , then captaincy comes up|pg||
nt|casenjo:  But on the rest of the hands description comes into play|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 3@C was too much.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  So, I'm easy. I go both ways :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@D sure looks like blackwood|pg||
mb|5C|nt|brolucius: It is forcing to game, with 10 opposite 12-14.|pg||
nt|pelu: I am with u Jo Anne - and there are no @h"suit" but best describtion|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: no after 4@D - the answer is not 5@c - so Cue bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cue bidding is not going to solve this hand|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR East bid 4@c, 4@D (cue) and then 4NT by East|pg||
nt|harmon: maybe 6 key card so 2 with q of c|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe a belated grand slam force by martel|pg||
nt|casenjo:  the heart suit is so anemic, I thought of raising 2 clubs to 3 immediately, instead of patterning out|pg||
mb|7C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 4@S might have made, but it might not|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Perfectly reasonable to take out insurance|pg||
nt|ritong: it s really late, i thought it was over  i certainly would not allow myself to crystalball a result that way:-)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  awesome, finally|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Jacobs 166   Markowicz 99             Mahaffey 127  Rosenthal 116        Diamond 180    Koneru 87     http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores  for more updates|pg||

nt|sybarra: and last bd now |pg||
nt|sybarra: and our great thx to Andy Hung,  the operator of our dreams @H |pg||
nt|brolucius: East quite rightly wanted to compete, but the choices were really a take-out double or perhaps 2NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Last here thanks all |pg||
nt|Walddk4: But they did not play :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow -- that is fast then|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Next session will start at 7:30 central time|pg||
nt|Walddk4: HH are fast, Passell too|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Obviously these guys switched around the responses, but they all work, as long as you agree|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like that better, shape is usually more important than size|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Last hand thanks all|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Much thanks to our hard working vugraph operator and organizer Jan Martel|pg||
nt|fabsayc: http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores for final results|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and to our many commentators  |pg||
nt|casenjo:  The next bid by opener asks|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  Martin and Peter: It has been a pleasure!!!|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: 1N=12-15  could be 4441@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: So in about an hour and 40 mins|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess that's just a penalty double|pg||
nt|dburn: but Strul seems uneasy about it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes  vs WeakNT  DBL=Pen|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I see - Gromov's pass was artificial, and Strul wanted to know what it meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: Thanks guys, it's been a pleasure =)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I mean responder|pg||
nt|pelu: tx Jo Anne|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Is this Flannery? I didn't know anyone still played it.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the top seeds were winning at last update in the wagar|pg||
nt|casenjo:  It looks like a Flannery hand 11-15 with 4 spades and 5 hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: ask Roland - the forbidden F-convention :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is and they are not alone|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks everybody, a pleasure|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dburn: mind you, I don;t know what he found out about it that prompted him to do that|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: just been informed next session starts at 8|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  Hope to see everyone tomorrow|pg||
nt|casenjo:  The Finals of the Wagar Women's KO and Round of 8 of the Spingold will both be on BBO|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk4: 2NT on this auction is a rare bird|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Time for breakfast :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I would not know what it meant|pg||
nt|ahollan1: note:  rare is a 4-letter word|pg||
nt|dburn: if I were Becker I would be a confused man by the end of this auction - ostensibly, 2NT should be a strong distributional hand that does not want to pass 1NT doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and a special thx always goes to Jan Martel for organizing the operatorts.  and to ACBL for bringing this tourney to bbo |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Strul must have taken double as conventional|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Otherwise 2NT and 3@S make no sense|pg||
nt|dburn: but Strul hasn't got one of those, so I have no idea where this will all end, except that it will all end in tears|pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|dima:  sporting double?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unfortunate end to a very good set for Becker-Strul|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They are not in complete agreement on which level to play at|pg||
nt|dburn: I really am not sure about all this - Becker may have concluded that Strul is two-suited (as I would) with spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|casenjo:  The Encyclopedia of Bridge has another version. Evidently there have been several variations.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: and of course to all the specs,  helpful , humorous comments |pg||
nt|fabsayc: more like 100, 10 or so i have used|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brolucius: This is the last board of the set and I'm sure we would all like to thank the splendid Asya, our special VG operator. Many thanks and well done!|pg||
nt|po-s: this looks enought|pg||
nt|Walddk4: From bad to worse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still avoiding the red card  [DBL]|pg||
nt|dburn: Strul appears to believe that Becker has some other hand than a penalty double of a weak no trump|pg||
nt|dima:  the biding is not over yet :)|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|nt|Walddk4: Is this bridge, I am asked. Well, this is extremely strange|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: Also, Jo Anne, my co-commentator. Thanks!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Last hand here thanks everyone for watching|pg||
nt|po-s: A grand seems to be too high|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|dburn: Becker now hasn't got a clue what's happening, and should probably have stopped bidding|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dima:  oh well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most notable  Zaleski 99 vs Nickell 55|pg||
nt|dburn: but this is really just a misunderstanding - sad end to what has been a great effort by Strul personally; he has played some very good bridge these past two hours|pg||
nt|dima:  tough opening lead problem :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Director is being called now|pg||
nt|dburn: I thought he might be|pg||
nt|po-s: About 4 down unless he guesses wrong here and rhere|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Private messages are welcomed of course, but please don't blame ME for this disaster. I am innocent|pg||
nt|po-s: I don´t think EW should complain|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Or me!|pg||
nt|dburn: because there must have been something in Dubinin's explanation of Gromov's pass to 1NT doubled that caused Strul to go off in this wild and woolly fashion|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This does not even qualify as a Roland slam, so leave me out of it|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly Gromov's pass was alerted, but I do not know what explanation Strul had - Becker would have had the right one, but that would not help him much|pg||
nt|po-s: with a good hand or some escape start|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you should probably consider the scores on bridgewinners  unofficial for a while|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: scores filtering in   http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: South might not have seen the 1nt alreat?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Berkowitz-Cohen have had much success and can find out just about anything below game|pg||
nt|casenjo:  The article is the ACBL July 2010 Bulletin. I think it might be available online.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: except when to play 3nt |pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores  for all results soon|pg||

pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|vugraphzfe: Dont know really|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Yes they are upest with the 1nt bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: worst ever was rubber bridge slam where defense scored added insult by collecting 100 honors|pg||
nt|po-s: Ah, they did reach seven after all|pg||
nt|dburn: well, whatever Strul leared from the director (or from the situation in general) has caused him to believe that if someone's going to go a lot off in something, it should be ...|pg||
nt|dburn: partner and not himself|pg||
nt|dima:  it is also the best combined fit|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I was just correcting the result to -5, instead of -4, and wanted to put the full auction in so it would be there|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: Indeed it is|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But maybe the 7-level is a bit high|pg||
