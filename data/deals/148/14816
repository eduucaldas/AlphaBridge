mb|p|mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: And bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: the trouble is that however Weest defends he helps declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S would have been the contract if West had not bid again|pg||
nt|marcsmith: hard to believe East is thinking here|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: surely he's not ever considering bidding|pg||
mb|d|mb|3C|nt|marcsmith: defence can get S S ruff HA AK d D ruff and a S to promote CQ for 3 down here|pg||
mb|3D|nt|marcsmith: North does better to double for 800 than bid 3D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not in love with this auction to tell the truth|pg||
nt|marcsmith: indeed|pg||
nt|marcsmith: is East really thinking of bidding on each round of this auction?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: He is apparently|pg||
nt|mr murray: hi|pg||
mb|3H|nt|marcsmith: East is completely potty -- didn't South already say he has four hearts?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Murray Melton|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Oh, apologies to Ishak|pg||

pc|c8|pg||
nt|marcsmith: whatever West does now helps declarer|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|h3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Provided that he ruffs the first diamond low|pg||
nt|marcsmith: even though they are scoring 420 here, I'd rather be defending 3C-X|pg||
nt|marcsmith: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are not scoring 420, Marc|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 590 rather|pg||
nt|marcsmith: even if he doesn't, he can ruff spade and lead a good diamond throwing a club|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 3C-X still 800 tho|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|mr murray: East thought he had a lot of tricks against hearts. He sould have been delighted not to be in 3clubs dbled|pg||
nt|marcsmith: ah he might go down on this line|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||

pc|hT|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c3|pc|h9|nt|marcsmith: West will get endplayed to give him CQ though|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: One round of trump was fine. The layout is an open book|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East must be 5-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|marcsmith: yes, impossible to go down|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mr murray: trying for the overtrick now :)|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|mamos:  seems unlikely that declarer can scramble 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: I suppose from where we sit  could pick up 3 club tricks  by playing low to the queen and king  and later laying down the ace  dropping west's J(  and later finessing against the ...|pg||
nt|ady: 8X in east hand   so could make 3 club tricks 1 spad   1 heart and 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: wests J9|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||

pc|dT|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|ady: needs to utilize dummys diamonds for 2 entries  1 to play the 3rd round of clubs and 1 to play a heart|pg||

nt|mamos:  @s7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Ruff by J and K@S and hand makes.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: east playing hearts sort of helped declarer   but understandably did not get the club position right|pg||
nt|mamos:  lol  ol|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  opposite a weak Diamond opener?|pg||
nt|mamos:  6@S opening?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|hawe45:  I hate to write it, but 4 @S was could in board 16, suppose South had played the @D 7...|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lml: so east west would like to be in five of a minor.  It may be hard now|pg||

mb|1H|mb|3D|nt|buffytvs: presumably that's a txfr|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|lml: I am sure it is|pg||
nt|guppy: well - 3N is even better than than 5m and Piotr found the winning initial action (1N vs. X) to steer them there|pg||
nt|lml: 5@H is a decent save or 5@C|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive at a partscore. Hard for EW to see there nice fit at @C|pg||
nt|rodal f: No @C play. Ruff a @S and a @D.|pg||
nt|ady: north decided on a quiet opening of 1 spade|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not even for money, I would bid 1 @S with such a suit|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lml: 5@D|pg||
nt|lml: either|pg||
nt|buffytvs: tough call for East now|pg||
nt|lml: With those trump I bet he bids on|pg||
nt|lml: if partner has diamonds it looks like he only has 2.5 losers|pg||
nt|buffytvs: a full 18 with a diamond fit, but does he want to commit to 11 tricks?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Cold up here two Hans:(  +5C by the morning.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I agree with you, AQ8@S in E  and he he could be endplayed but we have seen the cards.:)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|lml: well that will be a steal then|pg||
nt|buffytvs: thgouht he might dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  i not sure what North is going to achieve|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I think he should bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: if partner has nothing else he has good diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have a save  even vul against not at the 7 level  down 3|pg||
nt|mamos:  are EW getting punished|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But it could NEVER be better to play a @S, sorry|pg||
nt|rodal f: Have S told his story 3 times now?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodal f: But might S will be in after a @H lead. Then 10|pg||
nt|rnmalik: unlucky contract.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|buffytvs: avoiding the Elvis Coup in diamonds, which as it happens, doesn't cost|pg||
nt|lml: maybe he didnt think clubs was a transfer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he had even better clubs|pg||
nt|lml: otherwise that is sort of a strange lead|pg||
nt|buffytvs: what would you have led from his hand?|pg||
nt|lml: the elvis coup|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: keith is looking for some high cards|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|ady: this is the cheapet for e/w   480 on the club lead|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Being vul W did not open the hand, |pg||
pc|c2|nt|buffytvs: he's oging to get a diamond lead, and will take the inference that North is likely to have longer spades, and play a spade to the king (I think)|pg||

nt|buffytvs: but 10 tricks in spades are even more difficult than 9 in NT on this deal|pg||
nt|lml: well the heart lead didnt hurt him|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- Keith avoided the club lead|pg||
nt|lml: if he guesses spades there might be some sort of endplay|pg||
nt|buffytvs: which would blow a trick|pg||
nt|lml: so how can you make it|pg||
nt|buffytvs: strip hearts, draw trumps, and play a diamond, hoping North ducks?|pg||
nt|mamos:  n our earlier stanza we saw examples where overcall not made and suit not lead and imps lost|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|buffytvs: then he has to give a ruff-sluff or play clubs, which would be enough|pg||

mb|p|nt|marcsmith: North is on planet zog|pg||
nt|marcsmith: swapped -500 for +50|pg||
nt|marcsmith: was 4NT Blackwood perhaps?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not easy to get to clubs if no-one bids them|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 6H will make too if he bids it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nah|pg||
nt|marcsmith: except for the club ruff at trick one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Diamond ruff|pg||
nt|marcsmith: can South find the lead though?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: club, sorry, it's early here|pg||

mb|d|nt|marcsmith: if West bids 6H i'll take any bets that it makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: yes, at trick one with that incredible double|pg||
nt|marcsmith: at least he's doing better than he was in 4NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think 4NT was to play|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: 6H would have been much more fun|pg||

nt|mamos:  i think so Frank|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: 2@S again?|pg||
nt|snoraa: dicey little hand..noone wants to play it|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lml: a couple of imps came back on the hand in 4@S where Taylor went 3 down after he didnt finesse the diamond|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|mamos:  not many would pass strong Club with North|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: do you think north south will buy this in spades?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no|pg||
nt|buffytvs: not undoubled anyway|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3rd seat very light opening by S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: in the OR Wolpert the West hand had a chance to raise diamonds|pg||
nt|buffytvs: as did West here|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but declined to|pg||
mb|4H|nt|buffytvs: now he will I think|pg||
nt|flash: welcome to Paul Thurston|pg||
nt|thurston:  jc might scramble 7 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I think he has to raise now... dont you?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: although I like dbl better on east's hand|pg||
nt|lml: or do you think ... my partner is playing me for this|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this just sounds like lots of diamonds|pg||
nt|buffytvs: exactly|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I would be thikning, if all partner needs is third jack of diamonds and an ace, he should have done something stronger|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: gords head is in his hands|pg||
nt|thurston:  ugly hand to lead from|pg||
nt|snoraa: good shot on lead|pg||
nt|thurston:  most effective start a low heart and that was probably Maurice's last choice|pg||
nt|flash: red suit best for the defense - @D8 would have been reasonable?   (but anything might've worked)|pg||
nt|flash: i love the Ten from that holding (if one is going to lead the suit)|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: on the other hand, playing in 4 of a minor is like kissing your sister|pg||
nt|flash: starts to unblock and should preserve any honor(s) in partner's hand|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|nt|ralfwil: as we expected - 3nt went down in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: wd Gord|pg||
nt|lml: I thought that was a tie|pg||
nt|flash: sorry - CSTCs - honour(s)|pg||
mb|p|nt|thurston:  always nive when part has the 9 so deceptive potential|pg||
mb|p|pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|alchilds: close|pg||
nt|lml: well norths spades arent so hot so he can definitely have the @HK now|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S can be made     there is an option of plays|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|mamos:  a Heart overcall would have made South's lead easier|pg||
nt|rodal f: A push or do E find the @D hook?|pg||
nt|mamos:  now Diamond finesse is  free|pg||
nt|mamos:  as Heart loser certain to go away|pg||
nt|ady: yes agree|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: leading a heart there forced him to take the finesse|pg||
nt|ady: if that fails fall back on club finesse|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might the @D was needed anyway, by a @H lead.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|dK|nt|flash: and it's worked (temporarily)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s2|pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d9|nt|flash: it appears that East's @S shift, although it didn't give anything away immediately, got the defense headed in the wrong direction|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mamos:  In Or North had bid Hearts so easy for South to find best lead|pg||
nt|mamos:  ooops|pg||
nt|rodal f: Driving for the @C hook|pg||
nt|ady: trying to bring diamond queen down in 3     bad odds compared with diamond finesse|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|flash: it was the middle card from his holding|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|buffytvs: notice the lead has change dagain -- that was the board on which NS failed to take a save against 5@D in this room|pg||
nt|ady: push|pg||
nt|mamos:  this looks poor line|pg||
nt|rodal f: But by % it's might right. Drop Q@D or hook @CK is better then a hook.|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|marcsmith: a better strategy for South would have been to play a diamond at trick 2 since you want declarer to lead the first trump from his hand|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||

nt|flash: so, unless E-W use Polish-style leads, perhaps West could have worked out not to cash the @SA|pg||
nt|mamos:  yes sorry Frank think you are wrong this time|pg||
nt|rodal f: But wich one?|pg||
nt|mamos:  a few imps back|pg||
nt|rodal f: But still 2 segments more so...|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: can take both   |pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|lml: 5@S|pg||
nt|lml: sorry|pg||
nt|mamos:  Diamond first and if fails Club|pg||

nt|snoraa: hi Paul:)|pg||
nt|thurston:  hi steve|pg||
nt|flash: a @C??|pg||
nt|flash: @S2???|pg||
nt|flash: passive or attack??|pg||
nt|thurston:  i like a club - maybe part's length and strength where nothing else rates to be|pg||
nt|snoraa: attack, but with what?  c best, but very hard|pg||
nt|thurston:  and that's without peeking!|pg||
nt|mamos:  3NT looks good result for EW here|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|flash: i must admit, i've played opposite Michael, so i had a bit of an edge here   :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Any for 1NT from N?|pg||
nt|mamos:  lots of 10s, 9s, 8s|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|rodal f: Any reason not leading a @C?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|buffytvs: nine tricks looks like a good result in the other room|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|lml: I think they are headed to the same contract as the OR|pg||
nt|buffytvs: the earlier Board where Gord went down in a tricky 2@S, Darren Wolpert took a very different line and ended up with 9 tricks --so now the lead is down to 6|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|lml: I wonder about the 2@C bud|pg||
nt|lml: bid|pg||
nt|lml: anybody know why he bid the 2 card suit|pg||
nt|lml: instead of hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: let u know in a minuter|pg||
nt|lml: somebody suggested that they reverse clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|ady: over the top in OR   another chance to get some imps back for Telkom|pg||
nt|rodal f: Strange when the sellular need to be at the hotelroom|pg||
nt|mamos:  NS bid game in Or without quite the values|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: works on this hand|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lml: fascinating|pg||
pc|hA|nt|buffytvs: this should be a pickup for Korbel -- I don't think he'll have any trouble making 2@C|pg||
nt|mamos:  prefer to overtake when xxx in dummy|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lml: I am just awed that they can get there|pg||
